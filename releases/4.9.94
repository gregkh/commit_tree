    Revert "xhci: plat: Register shutdown for xhci_plat"
    
    Pixel 2 field testers reported that when they tried to reboot their
    phones with some USB devices plugged in, the reboot would get wedged and
    eventually trigger watchdog reset.  Once the Pixel kernel team found a
    reliable repro case, they narrowed it down to this commit's 4.4.y
    backport.  Reverting the change made the issue go away.
    
    This reverts commit b07c12517f2aed0add8ce18146bb426b14099392.

    vrf: Fix use after free and double free in vrf_finish_output
    
    commit 82dd0d2a9a76fc8fa2b18d80b987d455728bf83a upstream.
    
    Miguel reported an skb use after free / double free in vrf_finish_output
    when neigh_output returns an error. The vrf driver should return after
    the call to neigh_output as it takes over the skb on error path as well.
    
    Patch is a simplified version of Miguel's patch which was written for 4.9,
    and updated to top of tree.

    net sched actions: fix dumping which requires several messages to user space
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 734549eb550c0c720bc89e50501f1b1e98cdd841 ]
    
    Fixes a bug in the tcf_dump_walker function that can cause some actions
    to not be reported when dumping a large number of actions. This issue
    became more aggrevated when cookies feature was added. In particular
    this issue is manifest when large cookie values are assigned to the
    actions and when enough actions are created that the resulting table
    must be dumped in multiple batches.
    
    The number of actions returned in each batch is limited by the total
    number of actions and the memory buffer size.  With small cookies
    the numeric limit is reached before the buffer size limit, which avoids
    the code path triggering this bug. When large cookies are used buffer
    fills before the numeric limit, and the erroneous code path is hit.
    
    For example after creating 32 csum actions with the cookie
    aaaabbbbccccdddd
    
    $ tc actions ls action csum
    total acts 26
    
        action order 0: csum (tcp) action continue
        index 1 ref 1 bind 0
        cookie aaaabbbbccccdddd
    
        .....
    
        action order 25: csum (tcp) action continue
        index 26 ref 1 bind 0
        cookie aaaabbbbccccdddd
    total acts 6
    
        action order 0: csum (tcp) action continue
        index 28 ref 1 bind 0
        cookie aaaabbbbccccdddd
    
        ......
    
        action order 5: csum (tcp) action continue
        index 32 ref 1 bind 0
        cookie aaaabbbbccccdddd
    
    Note that the action with index 27 is omitted from the report.

    strparser: Fix sign of err codes
    
    
    [ Upstream commit cd00edc179863848abab5cc5683de5b7b5f70954 ]
    
    strp_parser_err is called with a negative code everywhere, which then
    calls abort_parser with a negative code.  strp_msg_timeout calls
    abort_parser directly with a positive code.  Negate ETIMEDOUT
    to match signed-ness of other calls.
    
    The default abort_parser callback, strp_abort_strp, sets
    sk->sk_err to err.  Also negate the error here so sk_err always
    holds a positive value, as the rest of the net code expects.  Currently
    a negative sk_err can result in endless loops, or user code that
    thinks it actually sent/received err bytes.
    
    Found while testing net/tls_sw recv path.

    route: check sysctl_fib_multipath_use_neigh earlier than hash
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6174a30df1b902e1fedbd728f5343937e83e64e6 ]
    
    Prior to this patch, when one packet is hashed into path [1]
    (hash <= nh_upper_bound) and it's neigh is dead, it will try
    path [2]. However, if path [2]'s neigh is alive but it's
    hash > nh_upper_bound, it will not return this alive path.
    This packet will never be sent even if path [2] is alive.
    
     3.3.3.1/24:
      nexthop via 1.1.1.254 dev eth1 weight 1 <--[1] (dead neigh)
      nexthop via 2.2.2.254 dev eth2 weight 1 <--[2]
    
    With sysctl_fib_multipath_use_neigh set is supposed to find an
    available path respecting to the l3/l4 hash. But if there is
    no available route with this hash, it should at least return
    an alive route even with other hash.
    
    This patch is to fix it by processing fib_multipath_use_neigh
    earlier than the hash check, so that it will at least return
    an alive route if there is when fib_multipath_use_neigh is
    enabled. It's also compatible with before when there are alive
    routes with the l3/l4 hash.

    net/mlx4_en: Fix mixed PFC and Global pause user control requests
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e8814ceb7e8f468659ef9253bd212c07ae19584 ]
    
    Global pause and PFC configuration should be mutually exclusive (i.e. only
    one of them at most can be set). However, once PFC was turned off,
    driver automatically turned Global pause on. This is a bug.
    
    Fix the driver behaviour to turn off PFC/Global once the user turned the
    other on.
    
    This also fixed a weird behaviour that at a current time, the profile
    had both PFC and global pause configuration turned on, which is
    Hardware-wise impossible and caused returning false positive indication
    to query tools.
    
    In addition, fix error code when setting global pause or PFC to change
    metadata only upon successful change.
    
    Also, removed useless debug print.

    net/mlx5e: Sync netdev vxlan ports at open
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a117f73dc2430443f23e18367fa545981129c1a6 ]
    
    When mlx5_core is loaded it is expected to sync ports
    with all vxlan devices so it can support vxlan encap/decap.
    This is done via udp_tunnel_get_rx_info(). Currently this
    call is set in mlx5e_nic_enable() and if the netdev is not in
    NETREG_REGISTERED state it will not be called.
    
    Normally on load the netdev state is not NETREG_REGISTERED
    so udp_tunnel_get_rx_info() will not be called.
    
    Moving udp_tunnel_get_rx_info() to mlx5e_open() so
    it will be called on netdev UP event and allow encap/decap.

    This is actually a dead lock caused by sync slave hwaddr from master when
    the master is the slave's 'slave'. This dead loop check is actually done
    by netdev_master_upper_dev_link. However, Commit 1f718f0f4f97 ("bonding:
    populate neighbour's private on enslave") moved it after dev_mc_sync.
    
    This patch is to fix it by moving dev_mc_sync after master_upper_dev_link,
    so that this loop check would be earlier than dev_mc_sync. It also moves
    if (mode == BOND_MODE_8023AD) into if (!bond_uses_primary) clause as an
    improvement.
    
    Note team driver also has this issue, I will fix it in another patch.

    bonding: fix the err path for dev hwaddr sync in bond_enslave
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c78f6bfae2b10ff70e21d343e64584ea6280c26 ]
    
    vlan_vids_add_by_dev is called right after dev hwaddr sync, so on
    the err path it should unsync dev hwaddr. Otherwise, the slave
    dev's hwaddr will never be unsync when this err happens.

    vhost: correctly remove wait queue during poll failure
    
    
    [ Upstream commit dc6455a71c7fc5117977e197f67f71b49f27baba ]
    
    We tried to remove vq poll from wait queue, but do not check whether
    or not it was in a list before. This will lead double free. Fixing
    this by switching to use vhost_poll_stop() which zeros poll->wqh after
    removing poll from waitqueue to make sure it won't be freed twice.

    r8169: fix setting driver_data after register_netdev
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 19c9ea363a244f85f90a424f9936e6d56449e33c ]
    
    pci_set_drvdata() is called only after registering the net_device,
    therefore we could run into a NPE if one of the functions using
    driver_data is called before it's set.
    
    Fix this by calling pci_set_drvdata() before registering the
    net_device.
    
    This fix is a candidate for stable. As far as I can see the
    bug has been there in kernel version 3.2 already, therefore
    I can't provide a reference which commit is fixed by it.
    
    The fix may need small adjustments per kernel version because
    due to other changes the label which is jumped to if
    register_netdev() fails has changed over time.

    pptp: remove a buggy dst release in pptp_connect()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit bfacfb457b36911a10140b8cb3ce76a74883ac5a ]
    
    Once dst has been cached in socket via sk_setup_caps(),
    it is illegal to call ip_rt_put() (or dst_release()),
    since sk_setup_caps() did not change dst refcount.
    
    We can still dereference it since we hold socket lock.

    net/sched: fix NULL dereference in the error path of tcf_bpf_init()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 3239534a79ee6f20cffd974173a1e62e0730e8ac ]
    
    when tcf_bpf_init_from_ops() fails (e.g. because of program having invalid
    number of instructions), tcf_bpf_cfg_cleanup() calls bpf_prog_put(NULL) or
    bpf_prog_destroy(NULL). Unless CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL is unset, this causes
    the following error:

    net/ipv6: Increment OUTxxx counters after netfilter hook
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 71a1c915238c970cd9bdd5bf158b1279d6b6d55b ]
    
    At the end of ip6_forward(), IPSTATS_MIB_OUTFORWDATAGRAMS and
    IPSTATS_MIB_OUTOCTETS are incremented immediately before the NF_HOOK call
    for NFPROTO_IPV6 / NF_INET_FORWARD.  As a result, these counters get
    incremented regardless of whether or not the netfilter hook allows the
    packet to continue being processed.  This change increments the counters
    in ip6_forward_finish() so that it will not happen if the netfilter hook
    chooses to terminate the packet, which is similar to how IPv4 works.

    net/ipv6: Fix route leaking between VRFs
    
    
    [ Upstream commit b6cdbc85234b072340b8923e69f49ec293f905dc ]
    
    Donald reported that IPv6 route leaking between VRFs is not working.
    The root cause is the strict argument in the call to rt6_lookup when
    validating the nexthop spec.
    
    ip6_route_check_nh validates the gateway and device (if given) of a
    route spec. It in turn could call rt6_lookup (e.g., lookup in a given
    table did not succeed so it falls back to a full lookup) and if so
    sets the strict argument to 1. That means if the egress device is given,
    the route lookup needs to return a result with the same device. This
    strict requirement does not work with VRFs (IPv4 or IPv6) because the
    oif in the flow struct is overridden with the index of the VRF device
    to trigger a match on the l3mdev rule and force the lookup to its table.
    
    The right long term solution is to add an l3mdev index to the flow
    struct such that the oif is not overridden. That solution will not
    backport well, so this patch aims for a simpler solution to relax the
    strict argument if the route spec device is an l3mdev slave. As done
    in other places, use the FLOWI_FLAG_SKIP_NH_OIF to know that the
    RT6_LOOKUP_F_IFACE flag needs to be removed.

    arp: fix arp_filter on l3slave devices
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 58b35f27689b5eb514fc293c332966c226b1b6e4 ]
    
    arp_filter performs an ip_route_output search for arp source address and
    checks if output device is the same where the arp request was received,
    if it is not, the arp request is not answered.
    
    This route lookup is always done on main route table so l3slave devices
    never find the proper route and arp is not answered.
    
    Passing l3mdev_master_ifindex_rcu(dev) return value as oif fixes the
    lookup for l3slave devices while maintaining same behavior for non
    l3slave devices as this function returns 0 in that case.

    [ Upstream commit 12663b442e5ac5aa3d6097cd3f287c71ba46d26e ]
    
    Reads from NAND devices usually trigger bitflips, this is an expected
    behavior. While bitflips are under a given threshold, the MTD core
    returns 0. However, when the number of corrected bitflips is above this
    same threshold, -EUCLEAN is returned to inform the upper layer that this
    block is slightly dying and soon the ECC engine will be overtaken so
    actions should be taken to move the data out of it.
    
    This particular condition should not be treated like an error and the
    test should continue.

    Input: goodix - disable IRQs while suspended
    
    
    [ Upstream commit faec44b6838312484d63e82286087cf2d5ebb891 ]
    
    We should not try to do any i2c transfers before the controller is
    resumed (which happens before our resume method gets called).
    
    So we need to disable our IRQ while suspended to enforce this. The
    code paths for devices with GPIOs for the int and reset pins already
    disable the IRQ the through goodix_free_irq().
    
    This commit also disables the IRQ while suspended for devices without
    GPIOs for the int and reset pins.
    
    This fixes the i2c bus sometimes getting stuck after a suspend/resume
    causing the touchscreen to sometimes not work after a suspend/resume.
    This has been tested on a GPD pocked device.

    tty: n_gsm: Allow ADM response in addition to UA for control dlci
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ea3d8465ab9b3e01be329ac5195970a84bef76c5 ]
    
    Some devices have the control dlci stay in ADM mode instead of the UA
    mode. This can seen at least on droid 4 when trying to open the ts
    27.010 mux port. Enabling n_gsm debug mode shows the control dlci
    always respond with DM to SABM instead of UA:
    
    # modprobe n_gsm debug=0xff
    # ldattach -d GSM0710 /dev/ttyS0 &
    gsmld_output: 00000000: f9 03 3f 01 1c f9
    --> 0) C: SABM(P)
    gsmld_receive: 00000000: f9 03 1f 01 36 f9
    <-- 0) C: DM(P)
    ...
    $ minicom -D /dev/gsmtty1
    minicom: cannot open /dev/gsmtty1: No error information
    $ strace minicom -D /dev/gsmtty1
    ...
    open("/dev/gsmtty1", O_RDWR|O_NOCTTY|O_NONBLOCK|O_LARGEFILE) = -1 EL2HLT
    
    Note that this is different issue from other n_gsm -EL2HLT issues such
    as timeouts when the control dlci does not respond at all.
    
    The ADM mode seems to be a quite common according to "RF Wireless World"
    article "GSM Issue-UE sends SABM and gets a DM response instead of
    UA response":
    
      This issue is most commonly observed in GSM networks where in UE sends
      SABM and expects network to send UA response but it ends up receiving
      DM response from the network. SABM stands for Set asynchronous balanced
      mode, UA stands for Unnumbered Acknowledge and DA stands for
      Disconnected Mode.
    
      An RLP entity can be in one of two modes:
      - Asynchronous Balanced Mode (ABM)
      - Asynchronous Disconnected Mode (ADM)
    
    Currently Linux kernel closes the control dlci after several retries
    in gsm_dlci_t1() on DM. This causes n_gsm /dev/gsmtty ports to produce
    error code -EL2HLT when trying to open them as the closing of control
    dlci has already set gsm->dead.
    
    Let's fix the issue by allowing control dlci stay in ADM mode after the
    retries so the /dev/gsmtty ports can be opened and used. It seems that
    it might take several attempts to get any response from the control
    dlci, so it's best to allow ADM mode only after the SABM retries are
    done.
    
    Note that for droid 4 additional patches are needed to mux the ttyS0
    pins and to toggle RTS gpio_149 to wake up the mdm6600 modem are also
    needed to use n_gsm. And the mdm6600 modem needs to be powered on.

    HW queues may be unmapped in some cases, such as blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues(),
    then we need to check it before calling blk_mq_tag_idle(), otherwise

    scsi: libsas: initialize sas_phy status according to response of DISCOVER
    
    
    [ Upstream commit affc67788fe5dfffad5cda3d461db5cf2b2ff2b0 ]
    
    The status of SAS PHY is in sas_phy->enabled. There is an issue that the
    status of a remote SAS PHY may be initialized incorrectly: if disable
    remote SAS PHY through sysfs interface (such as echo 0 >
    /sys/class/sas_phy/phy-1:0:0/enable), then reboot the system, and we
    will find the status of remote SAS PHY which is disabled before is
    1 (cat /sys/class/sas_phy/phy-1:0:0/enable). But actually the status of
    remote SAS PHY is disabled and the device attached is not found.
    
    In SAS protocol, NEGOTIATED LOGICAL LINK RATE field of DISCOVER response
    is 0x1 when remote SAS PHY is disabled. So initialize sas_phy->enabled
    according to the value of NEGOTIATED LOGICAL LINK RATE field.

    [ Upstream commit 2b23d9509fd7174b362482cf5f3b5f9a2265bc33 ]
    
    The intend purpose here was to goto out if smp_execute_task() returned
    error. Obviously something got screwed up. We will never get these link
    error statistics below:
    
    ~:/sys/class/sas_phy/phy-1:0:12 # cat invalid_dword_count
    0
    ~:/sys/class/sas_phy/phy-1:0:12 # cat running_disparity_error_count
    0
    ~:/sys/class/sas_phy/phy-1:0:12 # cat loss_of_dword_sync_count
    0
    ~:/sys/class/sas_phy/phy-1:0:12 # cat phy_reset_problem_count
    0
    
    Obviously we should goto error handler if smp_execute_task() returns
    non-zero.

    bcache: segregate flash only volume write streams
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 4eca1cb28d8b0574ca4f1f48e9331c5f852d43b9 ]
    
    In such scenario that there are some flash only volumes
    , and some cached devices, when many tasks request these devices in
    writeback mode, the write IOs may fall to the same bucket as bellow:
    | cached data | flash data | cached data | cached data| flash data|
    then after writeback of these cached devices, the bucket would
    be like bellow bucket:
    | free | flash data | free | free | flash data |
    
    So, there are many free space in this bucket, but since data of flash
    only volumes still exists, so this bucket cannot be reclaimable,
    which would cause waste of bucket space.
    
    In this patch, we segregate flash only volume write streams from
    cached devices, so data from flash only volumes and cached devices
    can store in different buckets.
    
    Compare to v1 patch, this patch do not add a additionally open bucket
    list, and it is try best to segregate flash only volume write streams
    from cached devices, sectors of flash only volumes may still be mixed
    with dirty sectors of cached device, but the number is very small.

    bcache: stop writeback thread after detaching
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 8d29c4426b9f8afaccf28de414fde8a722b35fdf ]
    
    Currently, when a cached device detaching from cache, writeback thread is
    not stopped, and writeback_rate_update work is not canceled. For example,
    after the following command:
    echo 1 >/sys/block/sdb/bcache/detach
    you can still see the writeback thread. Then you attach the device to the
    cache again, bcache will create another writeback thread, for example,
    after below command:
    echo  ba0fb5cd-658a-4533-9806-6ce166d883b9 > /sys/block/sdb/bcache/attach
    then you will see 2 writeback threads.
    This patch stops writeback thread and cancels writeback_rate_update work
    when cached device detaching from cache.
    
    Compare with patch v1, this v2 patch moves code down into the register
    lock for safety in case of any future changes as Coly and Mike suggested.

    drm/vc4: Fix resource leak in 'vc4_get_hang_state_ioctl()' in error handling path
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d0b1d259a4b58b21a21ea82d7174bf7ea825e9cc ]
    
    If one 'drm_gem_handle_create()' fails, we leak somes handles and some
    memory.
    
    In order to fix it:
      - move the 'free(bo_state)' at the end of the function so that it is also
        called in the eror handling path. This has the side effect to also try
        to free it if the first 'kcalloc' fails. This is harmless.
      - add a new label, err_delete_handle, in order to delete already
        allocated handles in error handling path
      - remove the now useless 'err' label
    
    The way the code is now written will also delete the handles if the
    'copy_to_user()' call fails.

    ACPICA: Disassembler: Abort on an invalid/unknown AML opcode
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6f0527b77d9e0129dd8e50945b0d610ed943d6b2 ]
    
    ACPICA commit ed0389cb11a61e63c568ac1f67948fc6a7bd1aeb
    
    An invalid opcode indicates something seriously wrong with the
    input AML file. The AML parser is immediately confused and lost,
    causing the resulting parse tree to be ill-formed. The actual
    disassembly can then cause numerous unrelated errors and faults.
    
    This change aborts the disassembly upon discovery of such an
    opcode during the AML parse phase.

    Bluetooth: Send HCI Set Event Mask Page 2 command only when needed
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 313f6888c8fbb1bc8b36c9012ce4e1de848df696 ]
    
    The Broadcom BCM20702 Bluetooth controller in ThinkPad-T530 devices
    report support for the Set Event Mask Page 2 command, but actually do
    return an error when trying to use it.
    
      < HCI Command: Read Local Supported Commands (0x04|0x0002) plen 0
      > HCI Event: Command Complete (0x0e) plen 68
           Read Local Supported Commands (0x04|0x0002) ncmd 1
             Status: Success (0x00)
             Commands: 162 entries
               ...
               Set Event Mask Page 2 (Octet 22 - Bit 2)
               ...
    
      < HCI Command: Set Event Mask Page 2 (0x03|0x0063) plen 8
             Mask: 0x0000000000000000

           Set Event Mask Page 2 (0x03|0x0063) ncmd 1
             Status: Unknown HCI Command (0x01)
    
    Since these controllers do not support any feature that would require
    the event mask page 2 to be modified, it is safe to not send this
    command at all. The default value is all bits set to zero.

    clk: meson: meson8b: add compatibles for Meson8 and Meson8m2
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 855f06a1009faabb0c6a3e9b49d115496d325856 ]
    
    The clock controller on Meson8, Meson8b and Meson8m2 is very similar
    based on the code from the Amlogic GPL kernel sources. Add separate
    compatibles for each SoC to make sure that we can easily implement
    all the small differences for each SoC later on.
    
    In general the Meson8 and Meson8m2 seem to be almost identical as they
    even share the same mach-meson8 directory in Amlogic's GPL kernel
    sources.
    The main clocks on Meson8, Meson8b and Meson8m2 are very similar,
    because they are all using the same PLL values, 90% of the clock gates
    are the same (the actual diffstat of the mach-meson8/clock.c and
    mach-meson8b/clock.c files is around 30 to 40 lines, when excluding
    all commented out code).
    The difference between the Meson8 and Meson8b clock gates seem to be:
    - Meson8 has AIU_PCLK, HDMI_RX, VCLK2_ENCT, VCLK2_ENCL, UART3,
      CSI_DIG_CLKIN gates which don't seem to be available on Meson8b
    - the gate on Meson8 for bit 7 seems to be named "_1200XXX" instead
      of "PERIPHS_TOP" (on Meson8b)
    - Meson8b has a SANA gate which doesn't seem to exist on Meson8 (or
      on Meson8 the same bit is used by the UART3 gate in Amlogic's GPL
      kernel sources)
    None of these gates is added for now, since it's unclear whether these
    definitions are actually correct (the VCLK2_ENCT gate for example is
    defined, but only used in some commented block).
    
    The main difference between all three SoCs seem to be the video (VPU)
    clocks. Apart from different supported clock rates (according to vpu.c
    in mach-meson8 and mach-meson8b from Amlogic's GPL kernel sources) the
    most notable difference is that Meson8m2 has a GP_PLL clock and a mux
    (probably the same as on the Meson GX SoCs) to support glitch-free
    (clock rate) switching.
    None of these VPU clocks are not supported by our mainline meson8b
    clock driver yet though.

    net: ena: fix race condition between submit and completion admin command
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 661d2b0ccef6a63f48b61105cf7be17403d1db01 ]
    
    Bug:
    "Completion context is occupied" error printout will be noticed in
    dmesg.
    This error will cause the admin command to fail, which will lead to
    an ena_probe() failure or a watchdog reset (depends on which admin
    command failed).
    
    Root cause:
    __ena_com_submit_admin_cmd() is the function that submits new entries to
    the admin queue.
    The function have a check that makes sure the queue is not full and the
    function does not override any outstanding command.
    It uses head and tail indexes for this check.
    The head is increased by ena_com_handle_admin_completion() which runs
    from interrupt context, and the tail index is increased by the submit
    function (the function is running under ->q_lock, so there is no risk
    of multithread increment).
    Each command is associated with a completion context. This context
    allocated before call to __ena_com_submit_admin_cmd() and freed by
    ena_com_wait_and_process_admin_cq_interrupts(), right after the command
    was completed.
    
    This can lead to a state where the head was increased, the check passed,
    but the completion context is still in use.
    
    Solution:
    Use the atomic variable ->outstanding_cmds instead of using the head and
    the tail indexes.
    This variable is safe for use since it is bumped in get_comp_ctx() in
    __ena_com_submit_admin_cmd() and is freed by comp_ctxt_release()

    net: ena: fix rare uncompleted admin command false alarm
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a77c1aafcc906f657d1a0890c1d898be9ee1d5c9 ]
    
    The current flow to detect admin completion is:
    while (command_not_completed) {
            if (timeout)
                    error
    
            check_for_completion()
                    sleep()
       }
    So in case the sleep took more than the timeout
    (in case the thread/workqueue was not scheduled due to higher priority
    task or prolonged VMexit), the driver can detect a stall even if
    the completion is present.
    
    The fix changes the order of this function to first check for
    completion and only after that check if the timeout expired.

    sparc64: ldc abort during vds iso boot
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6c95483b768c62f8ee933ae08a1bdbcb78b5410f ]
    
    Orabug: 20902628
    
    When an ldc control-only packet is received during data exchange in
    read_nonraw(), a new rx head is calculated but the rx queue head is not
    actually advanced (rx_set_head() is not called) and a branch is taken to
    'no_data' at which point two things can happen depending on the value
    of the newly calculated rx head and the current rx tail:
    
    - If the rx queue is determined to be not empty, then the wrong packet
      is picked up.
    
    - If the rx queue is determined to be empty, then a read error (EAGAIN)
      is eventually returned since it is falsely assumed that more data was
      expected.
    
    The fix is to update the rx head and return in case of a control only
    packet during data exchange.

    sctp: fix recursive locking warning in sctp_do_peeloff

    This patch is to avoid this warning by use lock_sock with subclass
    SINGLE_DEPTH_NESTING as Wang Cong and Marcelo's suggestion.

    bnx2x: Allow vfs to disable txvlan offload
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 92f85f05caa51d844af6ea14ffbc7a786446a644 ]
    
    VF clients are configured as enforced, meaning firmware is validating
    the correctness of their ethertype/vid during transmission.
    Once txvlan is disabled, VF would start getting SKBs for transmission
    here vlan is on the payload - but it'll pass the packet's ethertype
    instead of the vid, leading to firmware declaring it as malicious.

    crypto: omap-sham - fix closing of hash with separate finalize call
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 898d86a565925f09de3d0b30cf3b47ec2e409680 ]
    
    Currently there is an interesting corner case failure with omap-sham
    driver, if the finalize call is done separately with no data, but
    all previous data has already been processed. In this case, it is not
    possible to close the hash with the hardware without providing any data,
    so we get incorrect results. Fix this by adjusting the size of data
    sent to the hardware crypto engine in case the non-final data size falls
    on the block size boundary, by reducing the amount of data sent by one
    full block. This makes it sure that we always have some data available
    for the finalize call and we can close the hash properly.

    crypto: omap-sham - buffer handling fixes for hashing later
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5d78d57ede8f9e7f656c610ed25be7be337e0529 ]
    
    Currently, the hash later code only handles the cases when we have
    either new data coming in with the request or old data in the buffer,
    but not the combination when we have both. Fix this by changing the
    ordering of the code a bit and handling both cases properly
    simultaneously if needed. Also, fix an issue with omap_sham_update
    that surfaces with this fix, so that the code checks the bufcnt
    instead of total data amount against buffer length to avoid any
    buffer overflows.

    coresight: Fix reference count for software sources
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 022aa1a81b778789ee7cf3124595854276a0330d ]
    
    For software sources (i.e STM), there could be multiple agents
    generating the trace data, unlike the ETMs. So we need to
    properly do the accounting for the active number of users
    to disable the device when the last user goes away. Right
    now, the reference counting is broken for sources as we skip
    the actions when we detect that the source is enabled.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by adding the refcounting for
    software sources, even when they are enabled.

    skbuff: only inherit relevant tx_flags
    
    
    [ Upstream commit fff88030b3ff930ca7a3d74acfee0472f33887ea ]
    
    When inheriting tx_flags from one skbuff to another, always apply a
    mask to avoid overwriting unrelated other bits in the field.
    
    The two SKBTX_SHARED_FRAG cases clears all other bits. In practice,
    tx_flags are zero at this point now. But this is fragile. Timestamp
    flags are set, for instance, if in tcp_gso_segment, after this clear
    in skb_segment.
    
    The SKBTX_ANY_TSTAMP mask in __skb_tstamp_tx ensures that new
    skbs do not accidentally inherit flags such as SKBTX_SHARED_FRAG.

    net: emac: fix reset timeout with AR8035 phy
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 19d90ece81da802207a9b91ce95a29fbdc40626e ]
    
    This patch fixes a problem where the AR8035 PHY can't be
    detected on an Cisco Meraki MR24, if the ethernet cable is
    not connected on boot.
    
    Russell Senior provided steps to reproduce the issue:
    |Disconnect ethernet cable, apply power, wait until device has booted,
    |plug in ethernet, check for interfaces, no eth0 is listed.
    |
    |This appears to be a problem during probing of the AR8035 Phy chip.
    |When ethernet has no link, the phy detection fails, and eth0 is not
    |created. Plugging ethernet later has no effect, because there is no
    |interface as far as the kernel is concerned. The relevant part of
    |the boot log looks like this:
    |this is the failing case:
    |
    |[    0.876611] /plb/opb/emac-rgmii@ef601500: input 0 in RGMII mode
    |[    0.882532] /plb/opb/ethernet@ef600c00: reset timeout
    |[    0.888546] /plb/opb/ethernet@ef600c00: can't find PHY!
    |and the succeeding case:
    |
    |[    0.876672] /plb/opb/emac-rgmii@ef601500: input 0 in RGMII mode
    |[    0.883952] eth0: EMAC-0 /plb/opb/ethernet@ef600c00, MAC 00:01:..
    |[    0.890822] eth0: found Atheros 8035 Gigabit Ethernet PHY (0x01)
    
    Based on the comment and the commit message of
    commit 23fbb5a87c56 ("emac: Fix EMAC soft reset on 460EX/GT").
    This is because the AR8035 PHY doesn't provide the TX Clock,
    if the ethernet cable is not attached. This causes the reset
    to timeout and the PHY detection code in emac_init_phy() is
    unable to detect the AR8035 PHY. As a result, the emac driver
    bails out early and the user left with no ethernet.
    
    In order to stay compatible with existing configurations, the driver
    tries the current reset approach at first. Only if the first attempt
    timed out, it does perform one more retry with the clock temporarily
    switched to the internal source for just the duration of the reset.

    Fix loop device flush before configure v3
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6460495709aeb651896bc8e5c134b2e4ca7d34a8 ]
    
    While installing SLES-12 (based on v4.4), I found that the installer
    will stall for 60+ seconds during LVM disk scan.  The root cause was
    determined to be the removal of a bound device check in loop_flush()
    by commit b5dd2f6047ca ("block: loop: improve performance via blk-mq").
    
    Restoring this check, examining ->lo_state as set by loop_set_fd()
    eliminates the bad behavior.
    
    Test method:
    modprobe loop max_loop=64
    dd if=/dev/zero of=disk bs=512 count=200K
    for((i=0;i<4;i++))do losetup -f disk; done
    mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/loop0
    for((i=0;i<4;i++))do mkdir t$i; mount /dev/loop$i t$i;done
    for f in `ls /dev/loop[0-9]*|sort`; do \
            echo $f; dd if=$f of=/dev/null  bs=512 count=1; \
            done
    
    Test output:  stock          patched
    /dev/loop0    18.1217e-05    8.3842e-05
    /dev/loop1     6.1114e-05    0.000147979
    /dev/loop10    0.414701      0.000116564
    /dev/loop11    0.7474        6.7942e-05
    /dev/loop12    0.747986      8.9082e-05
    /dev/loop13    0.746532      7.4799e-05

    /dev/loop15    1.26453       7.2522e-05
    
    Note that from loop10 onward, the device is not mounted, yet the
    stock kernel consumes several orders of magnitude more wall time
    than it does for a mounted device.

    ARM: dts: armadillo800eva: Split LCD mux and gpio
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 13132b3f44d3600983aceb7e9920b8ebb55a7cf8 ]
    
    Configuration of the lcd0 pinmux group and GPIO hog for the external
    GPIO mux are done using a single device node, causing the "output-high"
    property to be applied to both.  This will fail for the pinmux group,
    but doesn't cause any harm, as the failure is ignored silently.
    
    However, after "pinctrl: sh-pfc: propagate errors on group config", the
    failure will become fatal, leading to a broken display:
    
        sh-pfc e6050000.pin-controller: pin_config_group_set op failed for group 102
        sh-pfc e6050000.pin-controller: Error applying setting, reverse things back
        sh-pfc e6050000.pin-controller: failed to select default state
    
    Move the GPIO hog to its own node to fix this.

    an invalid location (ie. only initialised to 0 and not to a specific

    MIPS: mm: adjust PKMAP location
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c56e7a4c3e77f6fbd9b55c06c14eda65aae58958 ]
    
    Space reserved for PKMap should span from PKMAP_BASE to FIXADDR_START.
    For large page sizes this is not the case as eg. for 64k pages the range
    currently defined is from 0xfe000000 to 0x102000000(!!) which obviously
    isn't right.
    Remove the hardcoded location and set the BASE address as an offset from
    FIXADDR_START.
    
    Since all PKMAP ptes have to be placed in a contiguous memory, ensure
    that this is the case by placing them all in a single page. This is
    achieved by aligning the end address to pkmap pages count pages.

    fixrange_init operates at PMD-granularity and expects the addresses to

    sched/deadline: Use the revised wakeup rule for suspending constrained dl tasks
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 3effcb4247e74a51f5d8b775a1ee4abf87cc089a ]
    
    We have been facing some problems with self-suspending constrained
    deadline tasks. The main reason is that the original CBS was not
    designed for such sort of tasks.
    
    One problem reported by Xunlei Pang takes place when a task
    suspends, and then is awakened before the deadline, but so close
    to the deadline that its remaining runtime can cause the task
    to have an absolute density higher than allowed. In such situation,
    the original CBS assumes that the task is facing an early activation,
    and so it replenishes the task and set another deadline, one deadline
    in the future. This rule works fine for implicit deadline tasks.
    Moreover, it allows the system to adapt the period of a task in which
    the external event source suffered from a clock drift.
    
    However, this opens the window for bandwidth leakage for constrained
    deadline tasks. For instance, a task with the following parameters:
    
      runtime   = 5 ms
      deadline  = 7 ms
      [density] = 5 / 7 = 0.71
      period    = 1000 ms
    
    If the task runs for 1 ms, and then suspends for another 1ms,
    it will be awakened with the following parameters:
    
      remaining runtime = 4
      laxity = 5
    
    presenting a absolute density of 4 / 5 = 0.80.
    
    In this case, the original CBS would assume the task had an early
    wakeup. Then, CBS will reset the runtime, and the absolute deadline will
    be postponed by one relative deadline, allowing the task to run.
    
    The problem is that, if the task runs this pattern forever, it will keep
    receiving bandwidth, being able to run 1ms every 2ms. Following this
    behavior, the task would be able to run 500 ms in 1 sec. Thus running
    more than the 5 ms / 1 sec the admission control allowed it to run.
    
    Trying to address the self-suspending case, Luca Abeni, Giuseppe
    Lipari, and Juri Lelli [1] revisited the CBS in order to deal with
    self-suspending tasks. In the new approach, rather than
    replenishing/postponing the absolute deadline, the revised wakeup rule
    adjusts the remaining runtime, reducing it to fit into the allowed
    density.
    
    A revised version of the idea is:
    
    At a given time t, the maximum absolute density of a task cannot be
    higher than its relative density, that is:
    
      runtime / (deadline - t) <= dl_runtime / dl_deadline
    
    Knowing the laxity of a task (deadline - t), it is possible to move
    it to the other side of the equality, thus enabling to define max
    remaining runtime a task can use within the absolute deadline, without
    over-running the allowed density:
    
      runtime = (dl_runtime / dl_deadline) * (deadline - t)
    
    For instance, in our previous example, the task could still run:
    
      runtime = ( 5 / 7 ) * 5
      runtime = 3.57 ms
    
    Without causing damage for other deadline tasks. It is note worthy
    that the laxity cannot be negative because that would cause a negative
    runtime. Thus, this patch depends on the patch:
    
      df8eac8cafce ("sched/deadline: Throttle a constrained deadline task activated after the deadline")
    
    Which throttles a constrained deadline task activated after the
    deadline.
    
    Finally, it is also possible to use the revised wakeup rule for
    all other tasks, but that would require some more discussions
    about pros and cons.

    perf/core: Correct event creation with PERF_FORMAT_GROUP
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ba5213ae6b88fb170c4771fef6553f759c7d8cdd ]
    
    Andi was asking about PERF_FORMAT_GROUP vs inherited events, which led
    to the discovery of a bug from commit:
    
      3dab77fb1bf8 ("perf: Rework/fix the whole read vs group stuff")
    
     -       PERF_SAMPLE_GROUP                       = 1U << 4,
     +       PERF_SAMPLE_READ                        = 1U << 4,
    
     -       if (attr->inherit && (attr->sample_type & PERF_SAMPLE_GROUP))
     +       if (attr->inherit && (attr->read_format & PERF_FORMAT_GROUP))
    
    is a clear fail :/
    
    While this changes user visible behaviour; it was previously possible
    to create an inherited event with PERF_SAMPLE_READ; this is deemed
    acceptible because its results were always incorrect.

    nvme: fix hang in remove path
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 82654b6b8ef8b93ee87a97fc562f87f081fc2f91 ]
    
    We need to start admin queues too in nvme_kill_queues()
    for avoiding hang in remove path[1].
    
    This patch is very similar with 806f026f9b901eaf(nvme: use
    blk_mq_start_hw_queues() in nvme_kill_queues()).

    nvme-pci: fix multiple ctrl removal scheduling
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 82b057caefaff2a891f821a617d939f46e03e844 ]
    
    Commit c5f6ce97c1210 tries to address multiple resets but fails as
    work_busy doesn't involve any synchronization and can fail.  This is
    reproducible easily as can be seen by WARNING below which is triggered
    with line:
    
    WARN_ON(dev->ctrl.state == NVME_CTRL_RESETTING)
    
    Allowing multiple resets can result in multiple controller removal as
    well if different conditions inside nvme_reset_work fail and which
    might deadlock on device_release_driver.

    This patch addresses the problem by using state of controller to
    decide whether reset should be queued or not as state change is
    synchronizated using controller spinlock.  Also cancel_work_sync is
    used to make sure remove cancels the reset_work and waits for it to
    finish.  This patch also changes return value from -ENODEV to more
    appropriate -EBUSY if nvme_reset fails to change state.

    igb: fix race condition with PTP_TX_IN_PROGRESS bits
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 4ccdc013b0ae04755a8f7905e0525955d52a77d0 ]
    
    Hardware related to the igb driver has a limitation of only handling one
    Tx timestamp at a time. Thus, the driver uses a state bit lock to
    enforce that only one timestamp request is honored at a time.
    
    Unfortunately this suffers from a simple race condition. The bit lock is
    not cleared until after skb_tstamp_tx() is called notifying the stack of
    a new Tx timestamp. Even a well behaved application which sends only one
    timestamp request at once and waits for a response might wake up and
    send a new packet before the bit lock is cleared. This results in
    needlessly dropping some Tx timestamp requests.
    
    We can fix this by unlocking the state bit as soon as we read the
    Timestamp register, as this is the first point at which it is safe to
    unlock.
    
    To avoid issues with the skb pointer, we'll use a copy of the pointer
    and set the global variable in the driver structure to NULL first. This
    ensures that the next timestamp request does not modify our local copy
    of the skb pointer.
    
    This ensures that well behaved applications do not accidentally race
    with the unlock bit. Obviously an application which sends multiple Tx
    timestamp requests at once will still only timestamp one packet at
    a time. Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about this.

    e1000e: fix race condition around skb_tstamp_tx()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5012863b7347866764c4a4e58b62fb05346b0d06 ]
    
    The e1000e driver and related hardware has a limitation on Tx PTP
    packets which requires we limit to timestamping a single packet at once.
    We do this by verifying that we never request a new Tx timestamp while
    we still have a tx_hwtstamp_skb pointer.
    
    Unfortunately the driver suffers from a race condition around this. The
    tx_hwtstamp_skb pointer is not set to NULL until after skb_tstamp_tx()
    is called. This function notifies the stack and applications of a new
    timestamp. Even a well behaved application that only sends a new request
    when the first one is finished might be woken up and possibly send
    a packet before we can free the timestamp in the driver again. The
    result is that we needlessly ignore some Tx timestamp requests in this
    corner case.
    
    Fix this by assigning the tx_hwtstamp_skb pointer prior to calling
    skb_tstamp_tx() and use a temporary pointer to hold the timestamped skb
    until that function finishes. This ensures that the application is not
    woken up until the driver is ready to begin timestamping a new packet.
    
    This ensures that well behaved applications do not accidentally race
    with condition to skip Tx timestamps. Obviously an application which
    sends multiple Tx timestamp requests at once will still only timestamp
    one packet at a time. Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about
    this.

    [ Upstream commit e4c49c4937951de1cdbe35572ade40c948dec1e1 ]
    
    We only need to handle d0i3 entry and exit during suspend resume if
    system_pm is set to IWL_PLAT_PM_MODE_D0I3, otherwise d0i3 entry
    failures will cause suspend to fail.

    iwlwifi: mvm: fix firmware debug restart recording
    
    
    [ Upstream commit addce854f164a68da9cb158e2e7e447705068549 ]
    
    When we want to stop the recording of the firmware debug
    and restart it later without reloading the firmware we
    don't need to resend the configuration that comes with
    host commands.
    Sending those commands confused the hardware and led to
    an NMI 0x66.
    
    Change the flow as following:
    * read the relevant registers (DBGC_IN_SAMPLE, DBGC_OUT_CTRL)
    * clear those registers
    * wait for the hardware to complete its write to the buffer
    * get the data
    * restore the value of those registers (to restart the
      recording)
    
    For early start (where the configuration is already
    compiled in the firmware), we don't need to set those
    registers after the firmware has been loaded, but only
    when we want to restart the recording without having
    restarted the firmware.

    In some situations the libdw unwinder stopped working properly.  I.e.
    with libunwind we see:

    But with libdw and without this patch this sample is not properly

    ~~~~~
    
    Debug output showed me that libdw found a module for the last frame
    address, but it thinks it belongs to /usr/lib/ld-2.25.so. This patch
    double-checks what libdw sees and what perf knows. If the mappings
    mismatch, we now report the elf known to perf. This fixes the situation
    above, and the libdw unwinder produces the same stack as libunwind.

    perf header: Set proper module name when build-id event found
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1deec1bd96ccd8beb04d2112a6d12fe20505c3a6 ]
    
    When perf processes build-id event, it creates DSOs with the build-id.
    But it didn't set the module short name (like '[module-name]') so when
    processing a kernel mmap event of the module, it cannot found the DSO as
    it only checks the short names.
    
    That leads for perf to create a same DSO without the build-id info and
    it'll lookup the system path even if the DSO is already in the build-id
    cache.  After kernel was updated, perf cannot find the DSO  and cannot
    show symbols in it anymore.
    
    You can see this if you have an old data file (w/ old kernel version):
    
      $ perf report -i perf.data.old -v |& grep scsi_mod
      build id event received for /lib/modules/3.19.2-1-ARCH/kernel/drivers/scsi/scsi_mod.ko.gz : cafe1ce6ca13a98a5d9ed3425cde249e57a27fc1
      Failed to open /lib/modules/3.19.2-1-ARCH/kernel/drivers/scsi/scsi_mod.ko.gz, continuing without symbols
      ...
    
    The second message didn't show the build-id.  With this patch:
    
      $ perf report -i perf.data.old -v |& grep scsi_mod
      build id event received for /lib/modules/3.19.2-1-ARCH/kernel/drivers/scsi/scsi_mod.ko.gz: cafe1ce6ca13a98a5d9ed3425cde249e57a27fc1
      /lib/modules/3.19.2-1-ARCH/kernel/drivers/scsi/scsi_mod.ko.gz with build id cafe1ce6ca13a98a5d9ed3425cde249e57a27fc1 not found, continuing without symbols
      ...
    
    Now it shows the build-id but still cannot load the symbol table.  This
    is a different problem which will be fixed in the next patch.

    [ Upstream commit 269f9883fe254d109afdfc657875c456d6fabb08 ]
    
    The Granular QoS per VF feature must be enabled in FW before it can be
    used.
    
    Thus, the driver cannot modify a QP's qos_vport value (via the UPDATE_QP FW
    command) if the feature has not been enabled -- the FW returns an error if
    this is attempted.

    skbuff: return -EMSGSIZE in skb_to_sgvec to prevent overflow
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 48a1df65334b74bd7531f932cca5928932abf769 ]
    
    This is a defense-in-depth measure in response to bugs like
    4d6fa57b4dab ("macsec: avoid heap overflow in skb_to_sgvec"). There's
    not only a potential overflow of sglist items, but also a stack overflow
    potential, so we fix this by limiting the amount of recursion this function
    is allowed to do. Not actually providing a bounded base case is a future
    disaster that we can easily avoid here.
    
    As a small matter of house keeping, we take this opportunity to move the
    documentation comment over the actual function the documentation is for.
    
    While this could be implemented by using an explicit stack of skbuffs,
    when implementing this, the function complexity increased considerably,
    and I don't think such complexity and bloat is actually worth it. So,
    instead I built this and tested it on x86, x86_64, ARM, ARM64, and MIPS,
    and measured the stack usage there. I also reverted the recent MIPS
    changes that give it a separate IRQ stack, so that I could experience
    some worst-case situations. I found that limiting it to 24 layers deep
    yielded a good stack usage with room for safety, as well as being much
    deeper than any driver actually ever creates.

    omap_gem uses page alignment for buffer stride. The related calculations

    arm64: kernel: restrict /dev/mem read() calls to linear region
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1151f838cb626005f4d69bf675dacaaa5ea909d6 ]
    
    When running lscpu on an AArch64 system that has SMBIOS version 2.0
    tables, it will segfault in the following way:
    
      Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff8000bfff0000
      pgd = ffff8000f9615000

      PC is at __arch_copy_to_user+0x90/0x220
      LR is at read_mem+0xcc/0x140
    
    This is caused by the fact that lspci issues a read() on /dev/mem at the
    offset where it expects to find the SMBIOS structure array. However, this
    region is classified as EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICE_DATA (as per the UEFI spec),
    and so it is omitted from the linear mapping.
    
    So let's restrict /dev/mem read/write access to those areas that are
    covered by the linear region.

    The s390 architecture maps sys_mmap (nr 90) into sys_old_mmap.  For this
    reason perf trace can't find the proper syscall event to get args format

    to get the correct translation.

    QCA99X0, QCA9888, QCA9984 supports calibration data in
    either OTP or DT/pre-cal file. Current ath10k supports
    Calibration data from OTP only.
    
    If caldata is loaded from DT/pre-cal file, fetching board id
    and applying calibration parameters like tx power gets failed.
    
    error log:

    [ Upstream commit 99acc9bede06bbb2662aafff51f5b9e529fa845e ]
    
    If a process dumps core while it has SPU contexts active then we have
    code to also dump information about the SPU contexts.
    
    Unfortunately it's been broken for 3 1/2 years, and we didn't notice. In
    commit 7b1f4020d0d1 ("spufs: get rid of dump_emit() wrappers") the nread
    variable was removed and rc used instead. That means when the loop exits
    successfully, rc has the number of bytes read, but it's then used as the
    return value for the function, which should return 0 on success.
    
    So fix it by setting rc = 0 before returning in the success case.

    KVM: SVM: do not zero out segment attributes if segment is unusable or not present
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d9c1b5431d5f0e07575db785a022bce91051ac1d ]
    
    This is a fix for the problem [1], where VMCB.CPL was set to 0 and interrupt
    was taken on userspace stack.  The root cause lies in the specific AMD CPU
    behaviour which manifests itself as unusable segment attributes on SYSRET.
    The corresponding work around for the kernel is the following:
    
    61f01dd941ba ("x86_64, asm: Work around AMD SYSRET SS descriptor attribute issue")
    
    In other turn virtualization side treated unusable segment incorrectly and
    restored CPL from SS attributes, which were zeroed out few lines above.
    
    In current patch it is assured only that P bit is cleared in VMCB.save state
    and segment attributes are not zeroed out if segment is not presented or is
    unusable, therefore CPL can be safely restored from DPL field.
    
    This is only one part of the fix, since QEMU side should be fixed accordingly
    not to zero out attributes on its side.  Corresponding patch will follow.

    mtd: nand: gpmi: Fix gpmi_nand_init() error path
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 4d02423e9afe6c46142ce98bbcaf5167316dbfbf ]
    
    The GPMI driver is wrongly assuming that nand_release() can safely be
    called on an uninitialized/unregistered NAND device.
    
    Add a new err_nand_cleanup label in the error path and only execute if
    nand_scan_tail() succeeded.
    
    Note that we now call nand_cleanup() instead of nand_release()
    (nand_release() is actually grouping the mtd_device_unregister() and
    nand_cleanup() in one call) because there's no point in trying to
    unregister a device that has never been registered.

    dt-bindings: display: sun4i: Add allwinner,tcon-channel property
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 22662f12768f971809b478386d9cc4947d00497a ]
    
    The Allwinner Timings Controller has two, mutually exclusive, channels.
    When the binding has been introduced, it was assumed that there would be
    only a single user per channel in the system.
    
    While this is likely for the channel 0 which only connects to LCD displays,
    it turns out that the channel 1 can be connected to multiple controllers in
    the SoC (HDMI and TV encoders for example). And while the simultaneous use
    of HDMI and TV outputs cannot be achieved, switching from one to the other
    at runtime definitely sounds plausible.
    
    Add an extra property, allwinner,tcon-channel, to specify for a given
    endpoint which TCON channel it is connected to, while falling back to the
    previous mechanism if that property is missing.

    SUNRPC: ensure correct error is reported by xs_tcp_setup_socket()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ea44adce91526700535b3150f77f8639ae8c82d ]
    
    If you attempt a TCP mount from an host that is unreachable in a way
    that triggers an immediate error from kernel_connect(), that error
    does not propagate up, instead EAGAIN is reported.
    
    This results in call_connect_status receiving the wrong error.
    
    A case that it easy to demonstrate is to attempt to mount from an
    address that results in ENETUNREACH, but first deleting any default
    route.
    Without this patch, the mount.nfs process is persistently runnable
    and is hard to kill.  With this patch it exits as it should.
    
    The problem is caused by the fact that xs_tcp_force_close() eventually
    calls
          xprt_wake_pending_tasks(xprt, -EAGAIN);
    which causes an error return of -EAGAIN.  so when xs_tcp_setup_sock()
    calls
          xprt_wake_pending_tasks(xprt, status);
    the status is ignored.

    rtc: interface: Validate alarm-time before handling rollover
    
    
    [ Upstream commit da96aea0ed177105cb13ee83b328f6c61e061d3f ]
    
    In function __rtc_read_alarm() its possible for an alarm time-stamp to
    be invalid even after replacing missing components with current
    time-stamp. The condition 'alarm->time.tm_year < 70' will trigger this
    case and will cause the call to 'rtc_tm_to_time64(&alarm->time)'
    return a negative value for variable t_alm.
    
    While handling alarm rollover this negative t_alm (assumed to seconds
    offset from '1970-01-01 00:00:00') is converted back to rtc_time via
    rtc_time64_to_tm() which results in this error log with seemingly
    garbage values:
    
    "rtc rtc0: invalid alarm value: -2-1--1041528741
    2005511117:71582844:32"
    
    This error was generated when the rtc driver (rtc-opal in this case)
    returned an alarm time-stamp of '00-00-00 00:00:00' to indicate that
    the alarm is disabled. Though I have submitted a separate fix for the
    rtc-opal driver, this issue may potentially impact other
    existing/future rtc drivers.
    
    To fix this issue the patch validates the alarm time-stamp just after
    filling up the missing datetime components and if rtc_valid_tm() still
    reports it to be invalid then bails out of the function without
    handling the rollover.

    rtc: opal: Handle disabled TPO in opal_get_tpo_time()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6dc1cf6f932bb0ea4d8f5e913a0a401ecacd2f03 ]
    
    On PowerNV platform when Timed-Power-On(TPO) is disabled, read of
    stored TPO yields value with all date components set to '0' inside
    opal_get_tpo_time(). The function opal_to_tm() then converts it to an
    offset from year 1900 yielding alarm-time == "1900-00-01
    00:00:00". This causes problems with __rtc_read_alarm() that
    expecting an offset from "1970-00-01 00:00:00" and returned alarm-time
    results in a -ve value for time64_t. Which ultimately results in this
    error reported in kernel logs with a seemingly garbage value:
    
    "rtc rtc0: invalid alarm value: -2-1--1041528741
    2005511117:71582844:32"
    
    We fix this by explicitly handling the case of all alarm date-time
    components being '0' inside opal_get_tpo_time() and returning -ENOENT
    in such a case. This signals generic rtc that no alarm is set and it
    bails out from the alarm initialization flow without reporting the
    above error.

      * Making encoded_op an unsigned type, so we can shift it left even if
        the top bit is set.
    
      * Casting to signed prior to shifting right when extracting oparg
        and cmparg
    
      * Consider only the bottom 5 bits of oparg when using it as a left-shift
        value.
    
    Whilst I think this catches all of the issues, I'd much prefer to remove
    this stuff, as I think it's unused and the bugs are copy-pasted between
    a bunch of architectures.

    backlight: Report error on failure
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7e715c2d9c27c23f3187454157c58cf292ed103e ]
    
    It is possible to update the backlight power and the brightness using
    the sysfs and on writing it either returns the count or if the callback
    function does not exist then returns the error code 'ENXIO'.
    
    We have a situation where the userspace client is writing to the sysfs
    to update the power and since the callback function exists the client
    receives the return value as count and considers the operation to be
    successful. That is correct as the write to the sysfs was successful.
    But there is no way to know if the actual operation was done or not.
    
    backlight_update_status() returns the error code if it fails. Pass that
    to the userspace client who is trying to update the power so that the
    client knows that the operation failed.

    HID: i2c: Call acpi_device_fix_up_power for ACPI-enumerated devices
    
    
    [ Upstream commit f3d3eab667de62572376abb1aa26316191c39929 ]
    
    For ACPI devices which do not have a _PSC method, the ACPI subsys cannot
    query their initial state at boot, so these devices are assumed to have
    been put in D0 by the BIOS, but for touchscreens that is not always true.
    
    This commit adds a call to acpi_device_fix_up_power to explicitly put
    devices without a _PSC method into D0 state (for devices with a _PSC
    method it is a nop). Note we only need to do this on probe, after a
    resume the ACPI subsys knows the device is in D3 and will properly
    put it in D0.
    
    This fixes the SIS0817 i2c-hid touchscreen on a Peaq C1010 2-in-1
    device failing to probe with a "hid_descr_cmd failed" error.

    netfilter: conntrack: don't call iter for non-confirmed conntracks
    
    
    [ Upstream commit b0feacaad13a0aa9657c37ed80991575981e2e3b ]
    
    nf_ct_iterate_cleanup_net currently calls iter() callback also for
    conntracks on the unconfirmed list, but this is unsafe.
    
    Acesses to nf_conn are fine, but some users access the extension area
    in the iter() callback, but that does only work reliably for confirmed
    conntracks (ct->ext can be reallocated at any time for unconfirmed
    conntrack).
    
    The seond issue is that there is a short window where a conntrack entry
    is neither on the list nor in the table: To confirm an entry, it is first
    removed from the unconfirmed list, then insert into the table.
    
    Fix this by iterating the unconfirmed list first and marking all entries
    as dying, then wait for rcu grace period.
    
    This makes sure all entries that were about to be confirmed either are
    in the main table, or will be dropped soon.

      Potentially there could be collisions when booting kexec if something
      else is mapped at the virtual address we allocated for runtime service
      regions in the initial boot - Matt Fleming ]
    
    Since kexec was never intended to work with efi=old_map, disable

    backlight: tdo24m: Fix the SPI CS between transfers
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 2023b0524a6310e9ea80daf085f51c71bff9289f ]
    
    Currently the LCD display (TD035S) on the cm-x300 platform is broken and
    remains blank.
    
    The TD0245S specification requires that the chipselect is toggled
    between commands sent to the panel. This was also the purpose of the
    former patch of commit f64dcac0b124 ("backlight: tdo24m: ensure chip
    select changes between transfers").
    
    Unfortunately, the "cs_change" field of a SPI transfer is
    misleading. Its true meaning is that for a SPI message holding multiple
    transfers, the chip select is toggled between each transfer, but for the
    last transfer it remains asserted.
    
    In this driver, all the SPI messages contain exactly one transfer, which
    means that each transfer is the last of its message, and as a
    consequence the chip select is never toggled.
    
    Actually, there was a second bug hidding the first one, hence the
    problem was not seen until v4.6. This problem was fixed by commit
    a52db659c79c ("spi: pxa2xx: Fix cs_change management") for PXA based
    boards.
    
    This fix makes the TD035S work again on a cm-x300 board. The same
    applies to other PXA boards, ie. corgi and tosa.

    In both elevator_switch_mq() and blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues(), sched tags

    gpio: label descriptors using the device name
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 24e78079bf2250874e33da2e7cfbb6db72d3caf4 ]
    
    Some GPIO lines appear named "?" in the lsgpio dump due to their
    requesting drivers not passing a reasonable label.
    
    Most typically this happens if a device tree node just defines
    gpios = <...> and not foo-gpios = <...>, the former gets named
    "foo" and the latter gets named "?".
    
    However the struct device passed in is always valid so let's
    just label the GPIO with dev_name() on the device if no proper
    label was passed.

    vfb: fix video mode and line_length being set when loaded
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7b9faf5df0ac495a1a3d7cdb64921c179f9008ac ]
    
    Currently, when loading the vfb module, the newly created fbdev
    has a line_length of 0, and its video mode would be PSEUDOCOLOR
    regardless of color depth. (The former could be worked around by
    calling the FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO ioctl with having the FBACTIVIATE_FORCE
    flag set.) This patch automatically sets the line_length correctly,
    and the video mode is derived from the bit depth now as well.

    mac80211: Fix setting TX power on monitor interfaces
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a3713ec360138f806c6fc368d1de570f692b347 ]
    
    Instead of calling ieee80211_recalc_txpower on monitor interfaces
    directly, call it using the virtual monitor interface, if one exists.
    
    In case of a single monitor interface given, reject setting TX power,
    if no virtual monitor interface exists.
    
    That being checked, don't warn in ieee80211_bss_info_change_notify,
    after setting TX power on a monitor interface.
    
    Fixes warning:

    acpi_ec.gpe is "unsigned long", hence treating it as "u32" would expose
    the wrong half on big-endian 64-bit systems.  Fix this by changing its
    type to "u32" and removing the cast, as all other code already uses u32
    or sometimes even only u8.

    irqchip/gic-v3: Fix the driver probe() fail due to disabled GICC entry
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ebe2f8718007d5a1238bb3cb8141b5bb2b4d5773 ]
    
    The ACPI specification says OS shouldn't attempt to use GICC configuration
    parameters if the flag ACPI_MADT_ENABLED is cleared. The ARM64-SMP code
    skips the disabled GICC entries but not causing any issue. However the
    current GICv3 driver probe bails out causing kernel panic() instead of
    skipping the disabled GICC interfaces. This issue happens on systems
    where redistributor regions are not in the always-on power domain and
    one of GICC interface marked with ACPI_MADT_ENABLED=0.
    
    This patch does the two things to fix the panic.
      - Don't return an error in gic_acpi_match_gicc() for disabled GICC entry.
      - No need to keep GICR region information for disabled GICC entry.
    
    Observed kernel crash on QDF2400 platform GICC entry is disabled.

    scsi: mpt3sas: Proper handling of set/clear of "ATA command pending" flag.
    
    
    [ Upstream commit f49d4aed1315a7b766d855f1367142e682b0cc87 ]
    
    1. In IO path, setting of "ATA command pending" flag early before device
       removal, invalid device handle etc., checks causes any new commands
       to be always returned with SAM_STAT_BUSY and when the driver removes
       the drive the SML issues SYNC Cache command and that command is
       always returned with SAM_STAT_BUSY and thus making SYNC Cache command
       to requeued.
    
    2. If the driver gets an ATA PT command for a SATA drive then the driver
       set "ATA command pending" flag in device specific data structure not
       to allow any further commands until the ATA PT command is completed.
       However, after setting the flag if the driver decides to return the
       command back to upper layers without actually issuing to the firmware
       (i.e., returns from qcmd failure return paths) then the corresponding
       flag is not cleared and this prevents the driver from sending any new
       commands to the drive.
    
    This patch fixes above two issues by setting of "ATA command pending"
    flag after checking for whether device deleted, invalid device handle,
    device busy with task management. And by setting "ATA command pending"
    flag to false in all of the qcmd failure return paths after setting the
    flag.

    scsi: libiscsi: Allow sd_shutdown on bad transport
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d754941225a7dbc61f6dd2173fa9498049f9a7ee ]
    
    If, for any reason, userland shuts down iscsi transport interfaces
    before proper logouts - like when logging in to LUNs manually, without
    logging out on server shutdown, or when automated scripts can't
    umount/logout from logged LUNs - kernel will hang forever on its
    sd_sync_cache() logic, after issuing the SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE cmd to all
    still existent paths.
    
    PID: 1 TASK: ffff8801a69b8000 CPU: 1 COMMAND: "systemd-shutdow"
     #0 [ffff8801a69c3a30] __schedule at ffffffff8183e9ee

     #9 [ffff8801a69c3da8] sd_shutdown at ffffffff815d3c3c
    
    This happens because iscsi_eh_cmd_timed_out(), the transport layer
    timeout helper, would tell the queue timeout function (scsi_times_out)
    to reset the request timer over and over, until the session state is
    back to logged in state. Unfortunately, during server shutdown, this
    might never happen again.
    
    Other option would be "not to handle" the issue in the transport
    layer. That would trigger the error handler logic, which would also need
    the session state to be logged in again.
    
    Best option, for such case, is to tell upper layers that the command was
    handled during the transport layer error handler helper, marking it as
    DID_NO_CONNECT, which will allow completion and inform about the
    problem.
    
    After the session was marked as ISCSI_STATE_FAILED, due to the first
    timeout during the server shutdown phase, all subsequent cmds will fail
    to be queued, allowing upper logic to fail faster.

    ASoC: Intel: cht_bsw_rt5645: Analog Mic support
    
    
    [ Upstream commit b70b309950418437bbd2a30afd169c4f09dee3e5 ]
    
    Various Cherry Trail boards with a rt5645 codec have an analog mic
    connected to IN2P + IN2N. The mic on this boards also needs micbias to
    be enabled, on some boards micbias1 is used and on others micbias2, so
    we enable both.
    
    This commit adds a new "Int Analog Mic" DAPM widget for this, so that we
    do not end up enabling micbias on boards with a digital mic which uses
    the already present "Int Mic" widget. Some existing UCM files already
    refer to "Int Mic" for their "Internal Analog Microphones" SectionDevice,
    but these don't work anyways since they enable the RECMIX BST1 Switch
    instead of the BST2 switch.

    hwmon: (ina2xx) Make calibration register value fixed
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5d389b125186cf254ad5b8015763ac07c151aea4 ]
    
    Calibration register is used for calculating current register in
    hardware according to datasheet:
    current = shunt_volt * calib_register / 2048 (ina 226)
    current = shunt_volt * calib_register / 4096 (ina 219)
    
    Fix calib_register value to 2048 for ina226 and 4096 for ina 219 in
    order to avoid truncation error and provide best precision allowed
    by shunt_voltage measurement. Make current scale value follow changes
    of shunt_resistor from sysfs as calib_register value is now fixed.
    
    Power_lsb value should also follow shunt_resistor changes as stated in
    datasheet:
    power_lsb = 25 * current_lsb (ina 226)
    power_lsb = 20 * current_lsb (ina 219)

    df->governor is being dereferenced before it is null checked,
    hence there is a potential null pointer dereference.
    
    Notice that df->governor is being null checked at line 1004:
    if (df->governor) {, which implies it might be null.
    
    Fix this by null checking df->governor before dereferencing it.

    VFS: close race between getcwd() and d_move()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 61647823aa920e395afcce4b57c32afb51456cab ]
    
    d_move() will call __d_drop() and then __d_rehash()
    on the dentry being moved.  This creates a small window
    when the dentry appears to be unhashed.  Many tests
    of d_unhashed() are made under ->d_lock and so are safe
    from racing with this window, but some aren't.
    In particular, getcwd() calls d_unlinked() (which calls
    d_unhashed()) without d_lock protection, so it can race.
    
    This races has been seen in practice with lustre, which uses d_move() as
    part of name lookup.  See:
       https://jira.hpdd.intel.com/browse/LU-9735
    It could race with a regular rename(), and result in ENOENT instead
    of either the 'before' or 'after' name.
    
    The race can be demonstrated with a simple program which
    has two threads, one renaming a directory back and forth
    while another calls getcwd() within that directory: it should never
    fail, but does.  See:
      https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9455345/
    
    We could fix this race by taking d_lock and rechecking when
    d_unhashed() reports true.  Alternately when can remove the window,
    which is the approach this patch takes.
    
    ___d_drop() is introduce which does *not* clear d_hash.pprev
    so the dentry still appears to be hashed.  __d_drop() calls
    ___d_drop(), then clears d_hash.pprev.
    __d_move() now uses ___d_drop() and only clears d_hash.pprev
    when not rehashing.

    ACPI / video: Default lcd_only to true on Win8-ready and newer machines
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5928c281524fe451114e04f1dfa11246a37e859f ]
    
    We're seeing a lot of bogus backlight interfaces on newer machines without
    a LCD such as desktops, servers and HDMI sticks. This causes userspace to
    show a non-functional brightness slider in e.g. the GNOME3 system menu,
    which is undesirable. And, in general, we should simply just not register
    a non functional backlight interface.
    
    Checking the LCD flag causes the bogus acpi_video backlight interfaces to
    go away (on the machines this was tested on).
    
    This change sets the lcd_only option by default on any machines which
    are Win8-ready, to fix this.
    
    This is not entirely without a risk of regressions, but video_detect.c
    already prefers native-backlight interfaces over the acpi_video one
    on Win8-ready machines, calling acpi_video_unregister_backlight() as soon
    as a native interface shows up. This is done because the ACPI backlight
    interface often is broken on Win8-ready machines, because win8 does not
    seem to actually use it.
    
    So in practice we already end up not registering the ACPI backlight
    interface on (most) Win8-ready machines with a LCD panel, thus this
    change does not change anything for (most) machines with a LCD panel
    and on machines without a LCD panel we actually don't want to register
    any backlight interfaces.
    
    This has been tested on the following machines and fixes a bogus backlight
    interface showing up there:
     - Desktop with an Asrock B150M Pro4S/D3 m.b. using i5-6500 builtin gfx
     - Intel Compute Stick STK1AW32SC
     - Meegopad T08 HDMI stick
    
    Bogus backlight interfaces have also been reported on:
     - Desktop with Asus H87I-Plus m.b.
     - Desktop with ASRock B75M-ITX m.b.
     - Desktop with Gigabyte Z87-D3HP m.b.
     - Dell PowerEdge T20 desktop

    rds; Reset rs->rs_bound_addr in rds_add_bound() failure path
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ae0c649c47f1c5d2db8cee6dd75855970af1669 ]
    
    If the rds_sock is not added to the bind_hash_table, we must
    reset rs_bound_addr so that rds_remove_bound will not trip on
    this rds_sock.
    
    rds_add_bound() does a rds_sock_put() in this failure path, so
    failing to reset rs_bound_addr will result in a socket refcount
    bug, and will trigger a WARN_ON with the stack shown below when
    the application subsequently tries to close the PF_RDS socket.

    net: llc: add lock_sock in llc_ui_bind to avoid a race condition
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 0908cf4dfef35fc6ac12329007052ebe93ff1081 ]
    
    There is a race condition in llc_ui_bind if two or more processes/threads
    try to bind a same socket.
    
    If more processes/threads bind a same socket success that will lead to
    two problems, one is this action is not what we expected, another is
    will lead to kernel in unstable status or oops(in my simple test case,
    cause llc2.ko can't unload).
    
    The current code is test SOCK_ZAPPED bit to avoid a process to
    bind a same socket twice but that is can't avoid more processes/threads
    try to bind a same socket at the same time.
    
    So, add lock_sock in llc_ui_bind like others, such as llc_ui_connect.

    KVM: nVMX: Fix handling of lmsw instruction
    
    
    [ Upstream commit e1d39b17e044e8ae819827810d87d809ba5f58c0 ]
    
    The decision whether or not to exit from L2 to L1 on an lmsw instruction is
    based on bogus values: instead of using the information encoded within the
    exit qualification, it uses the data also used for the mov-to-cr
    instruction, which boils down to using whatever is in %eax at that point.
    
    Use the correct values instead.
    
    Without this fix, an L1 may not get notified when a 32-bit Linux L2
    switches its secondary CPUs to protected mode; the L1 is only notified on
    the next modification of CR0. This short time window poses a problem, when
    there is some other reason to exit to L1 in between. Then, L2 will be
    resumed in real mode and chaos ensues.

    cpuhotplug: Link lock stacks for hotplug callbacks
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 49dfe2a6779717d9c18395684ee31bdc98b22e53 ]
    
    The CPU hotplug callbacks are not covered by lockdep versus the cpu hotplug
    rwsem.
    
    CPU0                                            CPU1
    cpuhp_setup_state(STATE, startup, teardown);
     cpus_read_lock();
      invoke_callback_on_ap();
        kick_hotplug_thread(ap);
        wait_for_completion();                      hotplug_thread_fn()
                                                      lock(m);
                                                      do_stuff();
                                                      unlock(m);
    
    Lockdep does not know about this dependency and will not trigger on the
    following code sequence:
    
              lock(m);
              cpus_read_lock();
    
    Add a lockdep map and connect the initiators lock chain with the hotplug
    thread lock chain, so potential deadlocks can be detected.

    bonding: Don't update slave->link until ready to commit
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 797a93647a48d6cb8a20641a86a71713a947f786 ]
    
    In the loadbalance arp monitoring scheme, when a slave link change is
    detected, the slave->link is immediately updated and slave_state_changed
    is set. Later down the function, the rtnl_lock is acquired and the
    changes are committed, updating the bond link state.
    
    However, the acquisition of the rtnl_lock can fail. The next time the
    monitor runs, since slave->link is already updated, it determines that
    link is unchanged. This results in the bond link state permanently out
    of sync with the slave link.
    
    This patch modifies bond_loadbalance_arp_mon() to handle link changes
    identical to bond_ab_arp_{inspect/commit}(). The new link state is
    maintained in slave->new_link until we're ready to commit at which point
    it's copied into slave->link.
    
    NOTE: miimon_{inspect/commit}() has a more complex state machine
    requiring the use of the bond_{propose,commit}_link_state() functions
    which maintains the intermediate state in slave->link_new_state. The arp
    monitors don't require that.
    
    Testing: This bug is very easy to reproduce with the following steps.
    1. In a loop, toggle a slave link of a bond slave interface.
    2. In a separate loop, do ifconfig up/down of an unrelated interface to
    create contention for rtnl_lock.
    Within a few iterations, the bond link goes out of sync with the slave
    link.

    [ Upstream commit 7c3f1875c66fbc19762760097cabc91849ea0bbb ]
    
    The default value for somaxconn is set in sysctl_core_net_init(), but this
    function is not called when kernel is configured without CONFIG_SYSCTL.
    
    This results in the kernel not being able to accept TCP connections,
    because the backlog has zero size. Usually, the user ends up with:
    "TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 7. Dropping request.  Check SNMP counters."
    If SYN cookies are not enabled the connection is rejected.
    
    Before ef547f2ac16 (tcp: remove max_qlen_log), the effects were less
    severe, because the backlog was always at least eight slots long.

    Linux TCP stack we analyze exhibits behavior that seems odd to me.
    The scenario is as follows (all packets have empty payloads, no window
    scaling, rcv/snd window size should not be a factor):
    
           TEST HARNESS (CLIENT)                        LINUX SERVER
    
       1.  -                                          LISTEN (server listen,
    then accepts)
    
       2.  - --> <SEQ=100><CTL=SYN>               --> SYN-RECEIVED
    
       3.  - <-- <SEQ=300><ACK=101><CTL=SYN,ACK>  <-- SYN-RECEIVED
    
       4.  - --> <SEQ=101><ACK=301><CTL=ACK>      --> ESTABLISHED
    
       5.  - <-- <SEQ=301><ACK=101><CTL=FIN,ACK>  <-- FIN WAIT-1 (server
    opts to close the data connection calling "close" on the connection
    socket)
    
       6.  - --> <SEQ=101><ACK=99999><CTL=FIN,ACK> --> CLOSING (client sends
    FIN,ACK with not yet sent acknowledgement number)
    
       7.  - <-- <SEQ=302><ACK=102><CTL=ACK>      <-- CLOSING (ACK is 102
    instead of 101, why?)
    
    ... (silence from CLIENT)
    
       8.  - <-- <SEQ=301><ACK=102><CTL=FIN,ACK>  <-- CLOSING
    (retransmission, again ACK is 102)
    
    Now, note that packet 6 while having the expected sequence number,
    acknowledges something that wasn't sent by the server. So I would
    expect
    the packet to maybe prompt an ACK response from the server, and then be
    ignored. Yet it is not ignored and actually leads to an increase of the
    acknowledgement number in the server's retransmission of the FIN,ACK
    packet. The explanation I found is that the FIN  in packet 6 was
    processed, despite the acknowledgement number being unacceptable.
    Further experiments indeed show that the server processes this FIN,
    transitioning to CLOSING, then on receiving an ACK for the FIN it had
    send in packet 5, the server (or better said connection) transitions
    from CLOSING to TIME_WAIT (as signaled by netstat).
    
    </quote>
    
    Indeed, tcp_rcv_state_process() calls tcp_ack() but
    does not exploit the @acceptable status but for TCP_SYN_RECV
    state.
    
    What we want here is to send a challenge ACK, if not in TCP_SYN_RECV
    state. TCP_FIN_WAIT1 state is not the only state we should fix.
    
    Add a FLAG_NO_CHALLENGE_ACK so that tcp_rcv_state_process()
    can choose to send a challenge ACK and discard the packet instead
    of wrongly change socket state.
    
    With help from Neal Cardwell.

    ARM64: PCI: Fix struct acpi_pci_root_ops allocation failure path
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 717902cc93118119a6fce7765da6cf2786987418 ]
    
    Commit 093d24a20442 ("arm64: PCI: Manage controller-specific data on
    per-controller basis") added code to allocate ACPI PCI root_ops
    dynamically on a per host bridge basis but failed to update the
    corresponding memory allocation failure path in pci_acpi_scan_root()
    leading to a potential memory leakage.
    
    Fix it by adding the required kfree call.

    ext4: fix off-by-one on max nr_pages in ext4_find_unwritten_pgoff()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 624327f8794704c5066b11a52f9da6a09dce7f9a ]
    
    ext4_find_unwritten_pgoff() is used to search for offset of hole or
    data in page range [index, end] (both inclusive), and the max number
    of pages to search should be at least one, if end == index.
    Otherwise the only page is missed and no hole or data is found,
    which is not correct.
    
    When block size is smaller than page size, this can be demonstrated
    by preallocating a file with size smaller than page size and writing
    data to the last block. E.g. run this xfs_io command on a 1k block
    size ext4 on x86_64 host.
    
      # xfs_io -fc "falloc 0 3k" -c "pwrite 2k 1k" \
                -c "seek -d 0" /mnt/ext4/testfile
      wrote 1024/1024 bytes at offset 2048
      1 KiB, 1 ops; 0.0000 sec (42.459 MiB/sec and 43478.2609 ops/sec)
      Whence  Result
      DATA    EOF
    
    Data at offset 2k was missed, and lseek(2) returned ENXIO.
    
    This is unconvered by generic/285 subtest 07 and 08 on ppc64 host,
    where pagesize is 64k. Because a recent change to generic/285
    reduced the preallocated file size to smaller than 64k.

    fix race in drivers/char/random.c:get_reg()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 9dfa7bba35ac08a63565d58c454dccb7e1bb0a08 ]
    
    get_reg() can be reentered on architectures with prioritized interrupts
    (m68k in this case), causing f->reg_index to be incremented after the
    range check. Out of bounds memory access past the pt_regs struct results.
    This will go mostly undetected unless access is beyond end of memory.
    
    Prevent the race by disabling interrupts in get_reg().
    
    Tested on m68k (Atari Falcon, and ARAnyM emulator).
    
    Kudos to Geert Uytterhoeven for helping to trace this race.

    netfilter: ctnetlink: fix incorrect nf_ct_put during hash resize
    
    
    [ Upstream commit fefa92679dbe0c613e62b6c27235dcfbe9640ad1 ]
    
    If nf_conntrack_htable_size was adjusted by the user during the ct
    dump operation, we may invoke nf_ct_put twice for the same ct, i.e.
    the "last" ct. This will cause the ct will be freed but still linked
    in hash buckets.
    
    It's very easy to reproduce the problem by the following commands:
      # while : ; do
      echo $RANDOM > /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_buckets
      done
      # while : ; do
      conntrack -L
      done
      # iperf -s 127.0.0.1 &
      # iperf -c 127.0.0.1 -P 60 -t 36000
    
    After a while, the system will hang like this:
      NMI watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#1 stuck for 22s! [bash:20184]
      NMI watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 22s! [iperf:20382]
      ...
    
    So at last if we find cb->args[1] is equal to "last", this means hash
    resize happened, then we can set cb->args[1] to 0 to fix the above
    issue.

    perf report: Fix off-by-one for non-activation frames
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1982ad48fc82c284a5cc55697a012d3357e84d01 ]
    
    As the documentation for dwfl_frame_pc says, frames that
    are no activation frames need to have their program counter
    decremented by one to properly find the function of the caller.
    
    This fixes many cases where perf report currently attributes
    the cost to the next line. I.e. I have code like this:
    
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      #include <thread>
      #include <chrono>
    
      using namespace std;
    
      int main()
      {
        this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(1000));
        this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(100));
        this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(10));
    
        return 0;
      }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    Now compile and record it:
    
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      g++ -std=c++11 -g -O2 test.cpp
      echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/sched_schedstats
      perf record \
        --event sched:sched_stat_sleep \
        --event sched:sched_process_exit \
        --event sched:sched_switch --call-graph=dwarf \
        --output perf.data.raw \
        ./a.out
      echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/sched_schedstats
      perf inject --sched-stat --input perf.data.raw --output perf.data
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    Before this patch, the report clearly shows the off-by-one issue.
    Most notably, the last sleep invocation is incorrectly attributed
    to the "return 0;" line:

    Note how this patch fixes this issue for both unwinding methods, i.e.
    both dwfl and libunwind. The former case is straight-forward thanks
    to dwfl_frame_pc(). For libunwind, we replace the functionality via
    unw_is_signal_frame() for any but the very first frame.

    libceph: NULL deref on crush_decode() error path
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 293dffaad8d500e1a5336eeb90d544cf40d4fbd8 ]
    
    If there is not enough space then ceph_decode_32_safe() does a goto bad.
    We need to return an error code in that situation.  The current code
    returns ERR_PTR(0) which is NULL.  The callers are not expecting that
    and it results in a NULL dereference.

    net: ieee802154: fix net_device reference release too early
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a611c58b3d42a92e6b23423e166dd17c0c7fffce ]
    
    This patch fixes the kernel oops when release net_device reference in
    advance. In function raw_sendmsg(i think the dgram_sendmsg has the same
    problem), there is a race condition between dev_put and dev_queue_xmit
    when the device is gong that maybe lead to dev_queue_ximt to see
    an illegal net_device pointer.
    
    My test kernel is 3.13.0-32 and because i am not have a real 802154
    device, so i change lowpan_newlink function to this:
    
            /* find and hold real wpan device */
            real_dev = dev_get_by_index(src_net, nla_get_u32(tb[IFLA_LINK]));
            if (!real_dev)
                    return -ENODEV;
    //      if (real_dev->type != ARPHRD_IEEE802154) {
    //              dev_put(real_dev);
    //              return -EINVAL;
    //      }
            lowpan_dev_info(dev)->real_dev = real_dev;
            lowpan_dev_info(dev)->fragment_tag = 0;
            mutex_init(&lowpan_dev_info(dev)->dev_list_mtx);
    
    Also, in order to simulate preempt, i change the raw_sendmsg function
    to this:
    
            skb->dev = dev;
            skb->sk  = sk;
            skb->protocol = htons(ETH_P_IEEE802154);
            dev_put(dev);
            //simulate preempt
            schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(30 * HZ);
            err = dev_queue_xmit(skb);
            if (err > 0)
                    err = net_xmit_errno(err);
    
    and this is my userspace test code named test_send_data:
    
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
            char buf[127];
            int sockfd;
            sockfd = socket(AF_IEEE802154, SOCK_RAW, 0);
            if (sockfd < 0) {
                    printf("create sockfd error: %s\n", strerror(errno));
                    return -1;
            }
            send(sockfd, buf, sizeof(buf), 0);
            return 0;
    }
    
    This is my test case:

    In my opinion, there is always exist a chance that the device is gong

    I think the latest kernel is have the same problem and that
    dev_put should be behind of the dev_queue_xmit.

    mlx5: fix bug reading rss_hash_type from CQE
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 12e8b570e732eaa5eae3a2895ba3fbcf91bde2b4 ]
    
    Masks for extracting part of the Completion Queue Entry (CQE)
    field rss_hash_type was swapped, namely CQE_RSS_HTYPE_IP and
    CQE_RSS_HTYPE_L4.
    
    The bug resulted in setting skb->l4_hash, even-though the
    rss_hash_type indicated that hash was NOT computed over the
    L4 (UDP or TCP) part of the packet.
    
    Added comments from the datasheet, to make it more clear what
    these masks are selecting.

    selinux: do not check open permission on sockets
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ccb544781d34afdb73a9a73ae53035d824d193bf ]
    
    open permission is currently only defined for files in the kernel
    (COMMON_FILE_PERMS rather than COMMON_FILE_SOCK_PERMS). Construction of
    an artificial test case that tries to open a socket via /proc/pid/fd will
    generate a recvfrom avc denial because recvfrom and open happen to map to
    the same permission bit in socket vs file classes.
    
    open of a socket via /proc/pid/fd is not supported by the kernel regardless
    and will ultimately return ENXIO. But we hit the permission check first and
    can thus produce these odd/misleading denials.  Omit the open check when
    operating on a socket.

    Its role is to give hints that optimizes performance,

    In non-SMP systems, functionality is not available as
    there is a single core, and all these calls definitely
    fail.  Hence, do not call the function and avoid the
    warning prints.

    gpio: crystalcove: Do not write regular gpio registers for virtual GPIOs
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 9a752b4c9ab924033bfdb8784c680d50b2bd5684 ]
    
    The Crystal Cove PMIC has 16 real GPIOs but the ACPI code for devices
    with this PMIC may address up to 95 GPIOs, these extra GPIOs are
    called virtual GPIOs and are used by the ACPI code as a method of
    accessing various non GPIO bits of PMIC.
    
    Commit dcdc3018d635 ("gpio: crystalcove: support virtual GPIO") added
    dummy support for these to avoid a bunch of ACPI errors, but instead of
    ignoring writes / reads to them by doing:
    
    if (gpio >= CRYSTALCOVE_GPIO_NUM)
            return 0;
    
    It accidentally introduced the following wrong check:
    
    if (gpio > CRYSTALCOVE_VGPIO_NUM)
            return 0;
    
    Which means that attempts by the ACPI code to access these gpios
    causes some arbitrary gpio to get touched through for example
    GPIO1P0CTLO + gpionr % 8.
    
    Since we do support input/output (but not interrupts) on the 0x5e
    virtual GPIO, this commit makes to_reg return -ENOTSUPP for unsupported
    virtual GPIOs so as to not have to check for (gpio >= CRYSTALCOVE_GPIO_NUM
    && gpio != 0x5e) everywhere and to make it easier to add support for more
    virtual GPIOs in the future.
    
    It then adds a check for to_reg returning an error to all callers where
    this may happen fixing the ACPI code accessing virtual GPIOs accidentally
    causing changes to real GPIOs.

    sched/numa: Use down_read_trylock() for the mmap_sem
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 8655d5497735b288f8a9b458bd22e7d1bf95bb61 ]
    
    A customer has reported a soft-lockup when running an intensive
    memory stress test, where the trace on multiple CPU's looks like this:
    
     RIP: 0010:[<ffffffff810c53fe>]
      [<ffffffff810c53fe>] native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x10e/0x190
    ...
     Call Trace:
      [<ffffffff81182d07>] queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x7/0xa
      [<ffffffff811bc331>] change_protection_range+0x3b1/0x930
      [<ffffffff811d4be8>] change_prot_numa+0x18/0x30
      [<ffffffff810adefe>] task_numa_work+0x1fe/0x310
      [<ffffffff81098322>] task_work_run+0x72/0x90
    
    Further investigation showed that the lock contention here is pmd_lock().
    
    The task_numa_work() function makes sure that only one thread is let to perform
    the work in a single scan period (via cmpxchg), but if there's a thread with
    mmap_sem locked for writing for several periods, multiple threads in
    task_numa_work() can build up a convoy waiting for mmap_sem for read and then
    all get unblocked at once.
    
    This patch changes the down_read() to the trylock version, which prevents the
    build up. For a workload experiencing mmap_sem contention, it's probably better
    to postpone the NUMA balancing work anyway. This seems to have fixed the soft
    lockups involving pmd_lock(), which is in line with the convoy theory.

    The driver checks an incorrect flag of functionality of adapter.
    When a driver requires i2c_smbus_read_byte_data and

    Using memcpy() from a buffer that is shorter than the length copied means
    the destination buffer is being filled with arbitrary data from the kernel
    rodata segment. In this case, the source was made longer, since it did not
    match the destination structure size. Additionally removes a needless cast.
    
    This was found with the future CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE feature.

    ARM: davinci: da8xx: Create DSP device only when assigned memory
    
    
    [ Upstream commit f97f03578b997a8ec2b9bc4928f958a865137268 ]
    
    The DSP device on Davinci platforms does not have an MMU and requires
    specific DDR memory to boot. This memory is reserved using the rproc_mem
    kernel boot parameter and is assigned to the device on non-DT boots.
    The remoteproc core uses the DMA API and so will fall back to assigning
    random memory if this memory is not assigned to the device, but the DSP
    remote processor boot will not be successful in such cases. So, check
    that memory has been reserved and assigned to the device specifically
    before even creating the DSP device.

    ext4: handle the rest of ext4_mb_load_buddy() ENOMEM errors
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 9651e6b2e20648d04d5e1fe6479a3056047e8781 ]
    
    I've got another report about breaking ext4 by ENOMEM error returned from
    ext4_mb_load_buddy() caused by memory shortage in memory cgroup.
    This time inside ext4_discard_preallocations().
    
    This patch replaces ext4_error() with ext4_warning() where errors returned
    from ext4_mb_load_buddy() are not fatal and handled by caller:
    * ext4_mb_discard_group_preallocations() - called before generating ENOSPC,
      we'll try to discard other group or return ENOSPC into user-space.
    * ext4_trim_all_free() - just stop trimming and return ENOMEM from ioctl.
    
    Some callers cannot handle errors, thus __GFP_NOFAIL is used for them:
    * ext4_discard_preallocations()
    * ext4_mb_discard_lg_preallocations()

    [ Upstream commit 61305664a542f874283f74bf0b27ddb31f5045d7 ]
    
    Reset GPIO is active low.
    
    Currently driver uses gpiod_set_value(1) to clean reset, which depends
    on device tree to contain GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH - that does not match reality.
    
    This fixes driver to use _raw version of gpiod_set_value() to enforce
    active-low semantics despite of what's written in device tree. Allowing
    device tree to override that only opens possibility for errors and does
    not add any value.
    
    Additionally, use _cansleep version to make things work with i2c-gpio
    and other sleeping gpio drivers.

    [ Upstream commit ee19ac340c5fdfd89c6348be4563453c61ab54a9 ]
    
    Currently, driver generates events for channels if new reading differs
    from previous one. This "previous value" is initialized to zero, which
    results into event if value is constant-one.
    
    Fix that by initializing "previous value" by reading at event enable
    time.
    
    This provides reliable sequence for userspace:
    - enable event,
    - AFTER THAT read current value,
    - AFTER THAT each event will correspond to change.

    selftests/powerpc: Fix TM resched DSCR test with some compilers
    
    
    [ Upstream commit fe06fe860250a4f01d0eaf70a2563b1997174a74 ]
    
    The tm-resched-dscr test has started failing sometimes, depending on
    what compiler it's built with, eg:
    
      test: tm_resched_dscr
      Check DSCR TM context switch: tm-resched-dscr: tm-resched-dscr.c:76: test_body: Assertion `rv' failed.
      !! child died by signal 6
    
    When it fails we see that the compiler doesn't initialise rv to 1 before
    entering the inline asm block. Although that's counter intuitive, it
    is allowed because we tell the compiler that the inline asm will write
    to rv (using "=r"), meaning the original value is irrelevant.
    
    Marking it as a read/write parameter would presumably work, but it seems
    simpler to fix it by setting the initial value of rv in the inline asm.

    powerpc/mm: Fix virt_addr_valid() etc. on 64-bit hash
    
    
    [ Upstream commit e41e53cd4fe331d0d1f06f8e4ed7e2cc63ee2c34 ]
    
    virt_addr_valid() is supposed to tell you if it's OK to call virt_to_page() on
    an address. What this means in practice is that it should only return true for
    addresses in the linear mapping which are backed by a valid PFN.
    
    We are failing to properly check that the address is in the linear mapping,
    because virt_to_pfn() will return a valid looking PFN for more or less any
    address. That bug is actually caused by __pa(), used in virt_to_pfn().
    
    eg: __pa(0xc000000000010000) = 0x10000  # Good
        __pa(0xd000000000010000) = 0x10000  # Bad!
        __pa(0x0000000000010000) = 0x10000  # Bad!
    
    This started happening after commit bdbc29c19b26 ("powerpc: Work around gcc
    miscompilation of __pa() on 64-bit") (Aug 2013), where we changed the definition
    of __pa() to work around a GCC bug. Prior to that we subtracted PAGE_OFFSET from
    the value passed to __pa(), meaning __pa() of a 0xd or 0x0 address would give
    you something bogus back.
    
    Until we can verify if that GCC bug is no longer an issue, or come up with
    another solution, this commit does the minimal fix to make virt_addr_valid()
    work, by explicitly checking that the address is in the linear mapping region.

    serial: sh-sci: Fix race condition causing garbage during shutdown
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1cf4a7efdc71cab84c42cfea7200608711ea954f ]
    
    If DMA is enabled and used, a burst of old data may be seen on the
    serial console during "poweroff" or "reboot".  uart_flush_buffer()
    clears the circular buffer, but sci_port.tx_dma_len is not reset.
    This leads to a circular buffer overflow, dumping (UART_XMIT_SIZE -
    sci_port.tx_dma_len) bytes.
    
    To fix this, add a .flush_buffer() callback that resets
    sci_port.tx_dma_len.

    serial: 8250: omap: Disable DMA for console UART
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 84b40e3b57eef1417479c00490dd4c9f6e5ffdbc ]
    
    Kernel always writes log messages to console via
    serial8250_console_write()->serial8250_console_putchar() which directly
    accesses UART_TX register _without_ using DMA.
    
    But, if other processes like systemd using same UART port, then these
    writes are handled by a different code flow using 8250_omap driver where
    there is provision to use DMA.
    
    It seems that it is possible that both DMA and CPU might simultaneously
    put data to UART FIFO and lead to potential loss of data due to FIFO
    overflow and weird data corruption. This happens when both kernel
    console and userspace tries to write simultaneously to the same UART
    port. Therefore, disable DMA on kernel console port to avoid potential
    race between CPU and DMA.

    [ Upstream commit aa18c4b6e0e39bfb00af48734ec24bc189ac9909 ]
    
    In the ene_usb6250 sub-driver for usb-storage, the SCSI residue is not
    reported correctly.  The residue is initialized to 0, but this value
    is overwritten whenever the driver sends firmware to the card reader
    before performing the current command.  As a result, a valid READ or
    WRITE operation appears to have failed, causing the SCSI core to retry
    the command multiple times and eventually fail.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by resetting the SCSI residue to 0 after
    sending firmware to the device.

    [ Upstream commit 4b309f1c4972c8f09e03ac64fc63510dbf5591a4 ]
    
    In the ene_usb6250 sub-driver for usb-storage, the ene_transport()
    routine is supposed to initialize the driver before executing the
    current command, if the initialization has not already been performed.
    However, a bug in the routine causes it to skip the command after
    doing the initialization.  Also, the routine does not return an
    appropriate error code if either the initialization or the command
    fails.
    
    As a result of the first bug, the first command (a SCSI INQUIRY) is
    not carried out.  The results can be seen in the system log, in the
    form of a warning message and empty or garbage INQUIRY data:

    pxa_camera: fix module remove codepath for v4l2 clock
    
    
    [ Upstream commit e3b4d10cc057522353c4a02f2f90dca6a52e006f ]
    
    The conversion from soc_camera omitted a correct handling of the clock
    gating for a sensor. When the pxa_camera driver module was removed it
    tried to unregister clk, but this caused a similar warning:
    
      WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 6740 at drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-clk.c:278
      v4l2_clk_unregister(): Refusing to unregister ref-counted 0-0030 clock!
    
    The clock was at time still refcounted by the sensor driver. Before
    the removing of the pxa_camera the clock must be dropped by the sensor
    driver. This should be triggered by v4l2_async_notifier_unregister() call
    which removes sensor driver module too, calls unbind() function and then
    tries to probe sensor driver again. Inside unbind() we can safely
    unregister the v4l2 clock as the sensor driver got removed. The original
    v4l2_clk_unregister() should be put inside test as the clock can be
    already unregistered from unbind(). If there was not any bound sensor
    the clock is still present.
    
    The codepath is practically a copy from the old soc_camera. The bug was
    tested with a pxa_camera+ov9640 combination during the conversion
    of the ov9640 from the soc_camera.

    arp: honour gratuitous ARP _replies_
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 23d268eb240954e6e78f7cfab04f2b1e79f84489 ]
    
    When arp_accept is 1, gratuitous ARPs are supposed to override matching
    entries irrespective of whether they arrive during locktime. This was
    implemented in commit 56022a8fdd87 ("ipv4: arp: update neighbour address
    when a gratuitous arp is received and arp_accept is set")
    
    There is a glitch in the patch though. RFC 2002, section 4.6, "ARP,
    Proxy ARP, and Gratuitous ARP", defines gratuitous ARPs so that they can
    be either of Request or Reply type. Those Reply gratuitous ARPs can be
    triggered with standard tooling, for example, arping -A option does just
    that.
    
    This patch fixes the glitch, making both Request and Reply flavours of
    gratuitous ARPs to behave identically.
    
    As per RFC, if gratuitous ARPs are of Reply type, their Target Hardware
    Address field should also be set to the link-layer address to which this
    cache entry should be updated. The field is present in ARP over Ethernet
    but not in IEEE 1394. In this patch, I don't consider any broadcasted
    ARP replies as gratuitous if the field is not present, to conform the
    standard. It's not clear whether there is such a thing for IEEE 1394 as
    a gratuitous ARP reply; until it's cleared up, we will ignore such
    broadcasts. Note that they will still update existing ARP cache entries,
    assuming they arrive out of locktime time interval.

    neighbour: update neigh timestamps iff update is effective
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 77d7123342dcf6442341b67816321d71da8b2b16 ]
    
    It's a common practice to send gratuitous ARPs after moving an
    IP address to another device to speed up healing of a service. To
    fulfill service availability constraints, the timing of network peers
    updating their caches to point to a new location of an IP address can be
    particularly important.
    
    Sometimes neigh_update calls won't touch neither lladdr nor state, for
    example if an update arrives in locktime interval. The neigh->updated
    value is tested by the protocol specific neigh code, which in turn
    will influence whether NEIGH_UPDATE_F_OVERRIDE gets set in the
    call to neigh_update() or not. As a result, we may effectively ignore
    the update request, bailing out of touching the neigh entry, except that
    we still bump its timestamps inside neigh_update.
    
    This may be a problem for updates arriving in quick succession. For
    example, consider the following scenario:
    
    A service is moved to another device with its IP address. The new device
    sends three gratuitous ARP requests into the network with ~1 seconds
    interval between them. Just before the first request arrives to one of
    network peer nodes, its neigh entry for the IP address transitions from
    STALE to DELAY.  This transition, among other things, updates
    neigh->updated. Once the kernel receives the first gratuitous ARP, it
    ignores it because its arrival time is inside the locktime interval. The
    kernel still bumps neigh->updated. Then the second gratuitous ARP
    request arrives, and it's also ignored because it's still in the (new)
    locktime interval. Same happens for the third request. The node
    eventually heals itself (after delay_first_probe_time seconds since the
    initial transition to DELAY state), but it just wasted some time and
    require a new ARP request/reply round trip. This unfortunate behaviour
    both puts more load on the network, as well as reduces service
    availability.
    
    This patch changes neigh_update so that it bumps neigh->updated (as well
    as neigh->confirmed) only once we are sure that either lladdr or entry
    state will change). In the scenario described above, it means that the
    second gratuitous ARP request will actually update the entry lladdr.
    
    Ideally, we would update the neigh entry on the very first gratuitous
    ARP request. The locktime mechanism is designed to ignore ARP updates in
    a short timeframe after a previous ARP update was honoured by the kernel
    layer. This would require tracking timestamps for state transitions
    separately from timestamps when actual updates are received. This would
    probably involve changes in neighbour struct. Therefore, the patch
    doesn't tackle the issue of the first gratuitous APR ignored, leaving
    it for a follow-up.

    uio: fix incorrect memory leak cleanup
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d83539092ddb1ab79b4d65bccb866bf07ea2ccd ]
    
    Commit 75f0aef6220d ("uio: fix memory leak") has fixed up some
    memory leaks during the failure paths of the addition of uio
    attributes, but still is not correct entirely. A kobject_uevent()
    failure still needs a kobject_put() and the kobject container
    structure allocation failure before the kobject_init() doesn't
    need a kobject_put(). Fix this properly.

    ata: libahci: properly propagate return value of platform_get_irq()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c034640a32f8456018d9c8c83799ead683046b95 ]
    
    When platform_get_irq() fails, it returns an error code, which
    libahci_platform and replaces it by -EINVAL. This commit fixes that by
    propagating the error code. It fixes the situation where
    platform_get_irq() returns -EPROBE_DEFER because the interrupt
    controller is not available yet, and generally looks like the right
    thing to do.
    
    We pay attention to not show the "no irq" message when we are in an
    EPROBE_DEFER situation, because the driver probing will be retried
    later on, once the interrupt controller becomes available to provide
    the interrupt.

    ipv6: avoid dad-failures for addresses with NODAD
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 66eb9f86e50547ec2a8ff7a75997066a74ef584b ]
    
    Every address gets added with TENTATIVE flag even for the addresses with
    IFA_F_NODAD flag and dad-work is scheduled for them. During this DAD process
    we realize it's an address with NODAD and complete the process without
    sending any probe. However the TENTATIVE flags stays on the
    address for sometime enough to cause misinterpretation when we receive a NS.
    While processing NS, if the address has TENTATIVE flag, we mark it DADFAILED
    and endup with an address that was originally configured as NODAD with
    DADFAILED.
    
    We can't avoid scheduling dad_work for addresses with NODAD but we can
    avoid adding TENTATIVE flag to avoid this racy situation.

    commit d98ecdaca296 ("arm64: perf: Count EL2 events if the kernel is
    running in HYP") returns -EINVAL when perf system call perf_event_open is
    called with exclude_hv != exclude_kernel. This change breaks applications
    on VHE enabled ARMv8.1 platforms. The issue was observed with HHVM
    application, which calls perf_event_open with exclude_hv = 1 and
    exclude_kernel = 0.
    
    There is no separate hypervisor privilege level when VHE is enabled, the
    host kernel runs at EL2. So when VHE is enabled, we should ignore
    exclude_hv from the application. This behaviour is consistent with PowerPC
    where the exclude_hv is ignored when the hypervisor is not present and with
    x86 where this flag is ignored.

    powerpc/modules: If mprofile-kernel is enabled add it to vermagic
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 43e24e82f35291d4c1ca78877ce1b20d3aeb78f1 ]
    
    On powerpc we can build the kernel with two different ABIs for mcount(), which
    is used by ftrace. Kernels built with one ABI do not know how to load modules
    built with the other ABI. The new style ABI is called "mprofile-kernel", for
    want of a better name.
    
    Currently if we build a module using the old style ABI, and the kernel with
    mprofile-kernel, when we load the module we'll oops something like:
    
      # insmod autofs4-no-mprofile-kernel.ko

    staging: wlan-ng: prism2mgmt.c: fixed a double endian conversion before calling hfa384x_drvr_setconfig16, also fixes relative sparse warning
    
    
    [ Upstream commit dea20579a69ab68cdca6adf79bb7c0c162eb9b72 ]
    
    staging: wlan-ng: prism2mgmt.c: This patches fixes a double endian conversion.
    cpu_to_le16() was called twice first in prism2mgmt_scan and again inside
    hfa384x_drvr_setconfig16() for the same variable, hence it was swapped
    twice. Incidentally, it also fixed the following sparse warning:
    
    drivers/staging/wlan-ng/prism2mgmt.c:173:30: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
    drivers/staging/wlan-ng/prism2mgmt.c:173:30:    expected unsigned short [unsigned] [usertype] word
    drivers/staging/wlan-ng/prism2mgmt.c:173:30:    got restricted __le16 [usertype] <noident>
    
    Unfortunately, only compile tested.

    ARM: dts: imx53-qsrb: Pulldown PMIC IRQ pin
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 2fe4bff3516924a37e083e3211364abe59db1161 ]
    
    Currently the following errors are seen:
    
    [   14.015056] mc13xxx 0-0008: Failed to read IRQ status: -6
    [   27.321093] mc13xxx 0-0008: Failed to read IRQ status: -6

    [   36.596900] mc13xxx 0-0008: Failed to read IRQ status: -6
    
    Also when reading the interrupts via 'cat /proc/interrupts' the
    PMIC GPIO interrupt counter does not stop increasing.
    
    The reason for the storm of interrupts is that the PUS field of
    register IOMUXC_SW_PAD_CTL_PAD_CSI0_DAT5 is currently configured as:
    10 : 100k pullup
    
    and the PMIC interrupt is being registered as IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH type,
    which is the correct type as per the MC34708 datasheet.
    
    Use the default power on value for the IOMUX, which sets PUS field as:
    00: 360k pull down
    
    This prevents the spurious PMIC interrupts from happening.
    
    Commit e1ffceb078c6 ("ARM: imx53: qsrb: fix PMIC interrupt level")
    correctly described the irq type as IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH, but
    missed to update the IOMUX of the PMIC GPIO as pull down.

    In the current code we accidentally return the successful result from

    for an error pointer and so it treats the returned value as a valid

    corrects support for reading a captured 64-bit address into a 64-bit

    A memoryless node, having no populated zones at all, was previously
    ignored, but will now trigger the WARN() in is_zone_first_populated().
    
    Remove this warning, as its only purpose was to warn of a situation that
    has since been enabled.
    
    Aside: The "per-node stats" are still printed under the first populated
    zone, but that's not necessarily the first stanza any more.  I'm not
    sure which criteria is more important with regard to not breaking
    parsers, but it looks a little weird to the eye.

    vmxnet3: ensure that adapter is in proper state during force_close
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1c4d5f51a812a82de97beee24f48ed05c65ebda5 ]
    
    There are several paths in vmxnet3, where settings changes cause the
    adapter to be brought down and back up (vmxnet3_set_ringparam among
    them).  Should part of the reset operation fail, these paths call
    vmxnet3_force_close, which enables all napi instances prior to calling
    dev_close (with the expectation that vmxnet3_close will then properly
    disable them again).  However, vmxnet3_force_close neglects to clear
    VMXNET3_STATE_BIT_QUIESCED prior to calling dev_close.  As a result
    vmxnet3_quiesce_dev (called from vmxnet3_close), returns early, and
    leaves all the napi instances in a enabled state while the device itself
    is closed.  If a device in this state is activated again, napi_enable
    will be called on already enabled napi_instances, leading to a BUG halt.
    
    The fix is to simply enausre that the QUIESCED bit is cleared in
    vmxnet3_force_close to allow quesence to be completed properly on close.

    irqchip/mbigen: Fix the clear register offset calculation
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 9459a04b6a5a09967eec94a1b66f0a74312819d9 ]
    
    The register array offset for clearing an interrupt is calculated by:
    
        offset = (hwirq - RESERVED_IRQ_PER_MBIGEN_CHIP) / 32;
    
    This is wrong because the clear register array includes the reserved
    interrupts. So the clear operation ends up in the wrong register.
    
    This went unnoticed so far, because the hardware clears the real bit
    through a timeout mechanism when the hardware is configured in debug
    mode. That debug mode was enabled on early generations of the hardware, so
    the problem was papered over.
    
    On newer hardware with updated firmware the debug mode was disabled, so the
    bits did not get cleared which causes the system to malfunction.
    
    Remove the subtraction of RESERVED_IRQ_PER_MBIGEN_CHIP, so the correct
    register is accessed.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Check copy_to/from_user return values
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 67325e988faea735d663799b6d152b5f4254093c ]
    
    The PR KVM implementation of the PAPR HPT hypercalls (H_ENTER etc.)
    access an image of the HPT in userspace memory using copy_from_user
    and copy_to_user.  Recently, the declarations of those functions were
    annotated to indicate that the return value must be checked.  Since
    this code doesn't currently check the return value, this causes
    compile warnings like the ones shown below, and since on PPC the
    default is to compile arch/powerpc with -Werror, this causes the
    build to fail.
    
    To fix this, we check the return values, and if non-zero, fail the
    hypercall being processed with a H_FUNCTION error return value.
    There is really no good error return value to use since PAPR didn't
    envisage the possibility that the hypervisor may not be able to access
    the guest's HPT, and H_FUNCTION (function not supported) seems as
    good as any.
    
    The typical compile warnings look like this:
    
      CC      arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_pr_papr.o

    mdio: mux: Correct mdio_mux_init error path issues
    
    
    [ Upstream commit b60161668199ac62011c024adc9e66713b9554e7 ]
    
    There is a potential unnecessary refcount decrement on error path of
    put_device(&pb->mii_bus->dev), as it is possible to avoid the
    of_mdio_find_bus() call if mux_bus is specified by the calling function.
    
    The same put_device() is not called in the error path if the
    devm_kzalloc of pb fails.  This caused the variable used in the
    put_device() to be changed, as the pb pointer was obviously not set up.
    
    There is an unnecessary of_node_get() on child_bus_node if the
    of_mdiobus_register() is successful, as the
    for_each_available_child_of_node() automatically increments this.
    Thus the refcount on this node will always be +1 more than it should be.
    
    There is no of_node_put() on child_bus_node if the of_mdiobus_register()
    call fails.
    
    Finally, it is lacking devm_kfree() of pb in the error path.  While this
    might not be technically necessary, it was present in other parts of the
    function.  So, I am adding it where necessary to make it uniform.

    netxen_nic: set rcode to the return status from the call to netxen_issue_cmd
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 0fe20fafd1791f993806d417048213ec57b81045 ]
    
    Currently rcode is being initialized to NX_RCODE_SUCCESS and later it

    blk-mq: NVMe 512B/4K+T10 DIF/DIX format returns I/O error on dd with split op
    
    
    [ Upstream commit f36ea50ca0043e7b1204feaf1d2ba6bd68c08d36 ]
    
    When formatting NVMe to 512B/4K + T10 DIf/DIX, dd with split op returns
    "Input/output error". Looks block layer split the bio after calling
    bio_integrity_prep(bio). This patch fixes the issue.
    
    Below is how we debug this issue:
    (1)format nvme to 4K block # size with type 2 DIF
    (2)dd with block size bigger than 1024k.
    oflag=direct
    dd: error writing '/dev/nvme0n1': Input/output error
    
    We added some debug code in nvme device driver. It showed us the first
    op and the second op have the same bi and pi address. This is not
    correct.
    
    1st op: nvme0n1 Op:Wr slba 0x505 length 0x100, PI ctrl=0x1400,
            dsmgmt=0x0, AT=0x0 & RT=0x505
            Guard 0x00b1, AT 0x0000, RT physical 0x00000505 RT virtual 0x00002828
    
    2nd op: nvme0n1 Op:Wr slba 0x605 length 0x1, PI ctrl=0x1400, dsmgmt=0x0,
            AT=0x0 & RT=0x605  ==> This op fails and subsequent 5 retires..
            Guard 0x00b1, AT 0x0000, RT physical 0x00000605 RT virtual 0x00002828
    
    With the fix, It showed us both of the first op and the second op have
    correct bi and pi address.
    
    1st op: nvme2n1 Op:Wr slba 0x505 length 0x100, PI ctrl=0x1400,

    perf/callchain: Force USER_DS when invoking perf_callchain_user()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 88b0193d9418c00340e45e0a913a0813bc6c8c96 ]
    
    Perf can generate and record a user callchain in response to a synchronous
    request, such as a tracepoint firing. If this happens under set_fs(KERNEL_DS),
    then we can end up walking the user stack (and dereferencing/saving whatever we
    find there) without the protections usually afforded by checks such as
    access_ok.
    
    Rather than play whack-a-mole with each architecture's stack unwinding
    implementation, fix the root of the problem by ensuring that we force USER_DS
    when invoking perf_callchain_user from the perf core.

    s390: move _text symbol to address higher than zero
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d04a4c76f71dd5335f8e499b59617382d84e2b8d ]
    
    The perf tool assumes that kernel symbols are never present at address
    zero. In fact it assumes if functions that map symbols to addresses
    return zero, that the symbol was not found.
    
    Given that s390's _text symbol historically is located at address zero
    this yields at least a couple of false errors and warnings in one of
    perf's test cases about not present symbols ("perf test 1").
    
    To fix this simply move the _text symbol to address 0x200, just behind
    the initial psw and channel program located at the beginning of the
    kernel image. This is now hard coded within the linker script.
    
    I tried a nicer solution which moves the initial psw and channel
    program into an own section. However that would move the symbols
    within the "real" head.text section to different addresses, since the
    ".org" statements within head.S are relative to the head.text
    section. If there is a new section in front, everything else will be
    moved. Alternatively I could have adjusted all ".org" statements. But
    this current solution seems to be the easiest one, since nobody really
    cares where the _text symbol is actually located.

    pidns: disable pid allocation if pid_ns_prepare_proc() is failed in alloc_pid()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 8896c23d2ef803f1883fea73117a435925c2b4c4 ]
    
    alloc_pidmap() advances pid_namespace::last_pid.  When first pid
    allocation fails, then next created process will have pid 2 and
    pid_ns_prepare_proc() won't be called.  So, pid_namespace::proc_mnt will
    never be initialized (not to mention that there won't be a child
    reaper).
    
    I saw crash stack of such case on kernel 3.10:
    
        BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at (null)
        IP: proc_flush_task+0x8f/0x1b0

            SyS_wait4+0x7d/0x110
    
    We may fix this by restore of last_pid in 0 or by prohibiting of futher
    allocations.  Since there was a similar issue in Oleg Nesterov's commit
    314a8ad0f18a ("pidns: fix free_pid() to handle the first fork failure").
    and it was fixed via prohibiting allocation, let's follow this way, and
    do the same.

    [ Upstream commit efda760fe95ea15291853c8fa9235c32d319cd98 ]
    
    As reported by David Jeffery: "a signal was sent to lockd while lockd
    was shutting down from a request to stop nfs.  The signal causes lockd
    to call restart_grace() which puts the lockd_net structure on the grace
    list.  If this signal is received at the wrong time, it will occur after
    lockd_down_net() has called locks_end_grace() but before
    lockd_down_net() stops the lockd thread.  This leads to lockd putting
    the lockd_net structure back on the grace list, then exiting without
    anything removing it from the list."
    
    So, perform the final locks_end_grace() from the the lockd thread; this
    ensures it's serialized with respect to restart_grace().

    [ Upstream commit 48f5bccc60675f8426a6159935e8636a1fd89f56 ]
    
    When users set flow control using ethtool the bits are set properly in the
    CPGMAC_SL MACCONTROL register, but the FIFO depth in the respective Port n
    Maximum FIFO Blocks (Pn_MAX_BLKS) registers remains set to the minimum size
    reset value. When receive flow control is enabled on a port, the port's
    associated FIFO block allocation must be adjusted. The port RX allocation
    must increase to accommodate the flow control runout. The TRM recommends
    numbers of 5 or 6.
    
    Hence, apply required Port FIFO configuration to
    Pn_MAX_BLKS.Pn_TX_MAX_BLKS=0xF and Pn_MAX_BLKS.Pn_RX_MAX_BLKS=0x5 during
    interface initialization.

    [ Upstream commit aeca3a77b1e0ed06a095933b89c86aed007383eb ]
    
    The zero padding that is added to NTB's does
    not zero the memory correctly.
    This is because the skb_put modifies the value
    of skb_out->len which results in the memset
    command not setting any memory to zero as
    (ctx->tx_max - skb_out->len) == 0.
    
    I have resolved this by storing the size of
    the memory to be zeroed before the skb_put
    and using this in the memset call.

    ubi: fastmap: Fix slab corruption
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a1435880f452430b41374d27ac4a33e7bd381ea ]
    
    Booting with UBI fastmap and SLUB debugging enabled results in the
    following splats.  The problem is that ubi_scan_fastmap() moves the
    fastmap blocks from the scan_ai (allocated in scan_fast()) to the ai
    allocated in ubi_attach().  This results in two problems:
    
     - When the scan_ai is freed, aebs which were allocated from its slab
       cache are still in use.
    
     - When the other ai is being destroyed in destroy_ai(), the
       arguments to kmem_cache_free() call are incorrect since aebs on its
       ->fastmap list were allocated with a slab cache from a differnt ai.
    
    Fix this by making a copy of the aebs in ubi_scan_fastmap() instead of
    moving them.

    Using memcpy() from a string that is shorter than the length copied means
    the destination buffer is being filled with arbitrary data from the kernel
    rodata segment. Instead, use strncpy() which will fill the trailing bytes
    with zeros.

    If ieee80211_hw_restart() is called during authentication, the
    authentication process will continue, causing the driver to be called
    in a wrong state.  This ultimately causes an oops in the iwlwifi

    The sadb_x_sec_len is stored in the unit 'byte divided by eight'.
    So we have to multiply this value by eight before we can do
    size checks. Otherwise we may get a slab-out-of-bounds when
    we memcpy the user sec_ctx.

    IB/srpt: Fix abort handling
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 55d694275f41a1c0eef4ef49044ff29bc3999490 ]
    
    Let the target core check the CMD_T_ABORTED flag instead of the SRP
    target driver. Hence remove the transport_check_aborted_status()
    call. Since state == SRPT_STATE_CMD_RSP_SENT is something that really
    should not happen, do not try to recover if srpt_queue_response() is
    called for an I/O context that is in that state. This patch is a bug
    fix because the srpt_abort_cmd() call is misplaced - if that function
    is called from srpt_queue_response() it should either be called
    before the command state is changed or after the response has been
    sent.

    supporting kernel FORTIFY_SOURCE, which uses the noreturn annotation
    on panic, and calls error(). GCC would warn about a noreturn function
    calling a non-noreturn function:
    
      arch/x86/boot/compressed/misc.c: In function ‘fortify_panic’:
      arch/x86/boot/compressed/misc.c:416:1: warning: ‘noreturn’ function does return
       }

    NFSv4.1: RECLAIM_COMPLETE must handle NFS4ERR_CONN_NOT_BOUND_TO_SESSION
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 0048fdd06614a4ea088f9fcad11511956b795698 ]
    
    If the server returns NFS4ERR_CONN_NOT_BOUND_TO_SESSION because we
    are trunking, then RECLAIM_COMPLETE must handle that by calling
    nfs4_schedule_session_recovery() and then retrying.

    ovl: persistent inode numbers for upper hardlinks
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5b6c9053fb38a66fd5c6177fcf5022b24767811a ]
    
    An upper type non directory dentry that is a copy up target
    should have a reference to its lower copy up origin.
    
    There are three ways for an upper type dentry to be instantiated:
    1. A lower type dentry that is being copied up
    2. An entry that is found in upper dir by ovl_lookup()
    3. A negative dentry is hardlinked to an upper type dentry
    
    In the first case, the lower reference is set before copy up.
    In the second case, the lower reference is found by ovl_lookup().
    In the last case of hardlinked upper dentry, it is not easy to
    update the lower reference of the negative dentry.  Instead,
    drop the newly hardlinked negative dentry from dcache and let
    the next access call ovl_lookup() to find its lower reference.
    
    This makes sure that the inode number reported by stat(2) after
    the hardlink is created is the same inode number that will be
    reported by stat(2) after mount cycle, which is the inode number
    of the lower copy up origin of the hardlink source.
    
    NOTE that this does not fix breaking of lower hardlinks on copy
    up, but only fixes the case of lower nlink == 1, whose upper copy
    up inode is hardlinked in upper dir.

    x86/mm/kaslr: Use the _ASM_MUL macro for multiplication to work around Clang incompatibility
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 121843eb02a6e2fa30aefab64bfe183c97230c75 ]
    
    The constraint "rm" allows the compiler to put mix_const into memory.
    When the input operand is a memory location then MUL needs an operand
    size suffix, since Clang can't infer the multiplication width from the
    operand.
    
    Add and use the _ASM_MUL macro which determines the operand size and
    resolves to the NUL instruction with the corresponding suffix.
    
    This fixes the following error when building with clang:
    
      CC      arch/x86/lib/kaslr.o
      /tmp/kaslr-dfe1ad.s: Assembler messages:

    x86/asm: Don't use RBP as a temporary register in csum_partial_copy_generic()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 42fc6c6cb1662ba2fa727dd01c9473c63be4e3b6 ]
    
    Andrey Konovalov reported the following warning while fuzzing the kernel
    with syzkaller:
    
      WARNING: kernel stack regs at ffff8800686869f8 in a.out:4933 has bad 'bp' value c3fc855a10167ec0
    
    The unwinder dump revealed that RBP had a bad value when an interrupt
    occurred in csum_partial_copy_generic().
    
    That function saves RBP on the stack and then overwrites it, using it as
    a scratch register.  That's problematic because it breaks stack traces
    if an interrupt occurs in the middle of the function.
    
    Replace the usage of RBP with another callee-saved register (R15) so
    stack traces are no longer affected.

    Function devm_regmap_init_mmio() returns an ERR_PTR on error. However,
    in function snvs_rtc_probe() its return value is checked against NULL.
    This patch fixes it by checking the return value with IS_ERR().

    cfg80211: make RATE_INFO_BW_20 the default
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 842be75c77cb72ee546a2b19da9c285fb3ded660 ]
    
    Due to the way I did the RX bitrate conversions in mac80211 with
    spatch, going setting flags to setting the value, many drivers now
    don't set the bandwidth value for 20 MHz, since with the flags it
    wasn't necessary to (there was no 20 MHz flag, only the others.)
    
    Rather than go through and try to fix up all the drivers, instead
    renumber the enum so that 20 MHz, which is the typical bandwidth,
    actually has the value 0, making those drivers all work again.
    
    If VHT was hit used with a driver not reporting it, e.g. iwlmvm,
    this manifested in hitting the bandwidth warning in
    cfg80211_calculate_bitrate_vht().
