    mm: fix exec activate_mm vs TLB shootdown and lazy tlb switching race
    
    commit d53c3dfb23c45f7d4f910c3a3ca84bf0a99c6143 upstream.
    
    Reading and modifying current->mm and current->active_mm and switching
    mm should be done with irqs off, to prevent races seeing an intermediate
    state.
    
    This is similar to commit 38cf307c1f20 ("mm: fix kthread_use_mm() vs TLB
    invalidate"). At exec-time when the new mm is activated, the old one
    should usually be single-threaded and no longer used, unless something
    else is holding an mm_users reference (which may be possible).
    
    Absent other mm_users, there is also a race with preemption and lazy tlb
    switching. Consider the kernel_execve case where the current thread is
    using a lazy tlb active mm:
    
      call_usermodehelper()
        kernel_execve()
          old_mm = current->mm;
          active_mm = current->active_mm;
          *** preempt *** -------------------->  schedule()
                                                   prev->active_mm = NULL;
                                                   mmdrop(prev active_mm);
                                                 ...
                          <--------------------  schedule()
          current->mm = mm;
          current->active_mm = mm;
          if (!old_mm)
              mmdrop(active_mm);
    
    If we switch back to the kernel thread from a different mm, there is a
    double free of the old active_mm, and a missing free of the new one.
    
    Closing this race only requires interrupts to be disabled while ->mm
    and ->active_mm are being switched, but the TLB problem requires also
    holding interrupts off over activate_mm. Unfortunately not all archs
    can do that yet, e.g., arm defers the switch if irqs are disabled and
    expects finish_arch_post_lock_switch() to be called to complete the
    flush; um takes a blocking lock in activate_mm().
    
    So as a first step, disable interrupts across the mm/active_mm updates
    to close the lazy tlb preempt race, and provide an arch option to
    extend that to activate_mm which allows architectures doing IPI based
    TLB shootdowns to close the second race.
    
    This is a bit ugly, but in the interest of fixing the bug and backporting
    before all architectures are converted this is a compromise.

    Convert trailing spaces and periods in path components
    
    commit 57c176074057531b249cf522d90c22313fa74b0b upstream.
    
    When converting trailing spaces and periods in paths, do so
    for every component of the path, not just the last component.
    If the conversion is not done for every path component, then
    subsequent operations in directories with trailing spaces or
    periods (e.g. create(), mkdir()) will fail with ENOENT. This
    is because on the server, the directory will have a special
    symbol in its name, and the client needs to provide the same.

    Revert "kernel/reboot.c: convert simple_strtoul to kstrtoint"
    
    commit 8b92c4ff4423aa9900cf838d3294fcade4dbda35 upstream.
    
    Patch series "fix parsing of reboot= cmdline", v3.
    
    The parsing of the reboot= cmdline has two major errors:
    
     - a missing bound check can crash the system on reboot
    
     - parsing of the cpu number only works if specified last
    
    Fix both.
    
    This patch (of 2):
    
    This reverts commit 616feab753972b97.
    
    kstrtoint() and simple_strtoul() have a subtle difference which makes
    them non interchangeable: if a non digit character is found amid the
    parsing, the former will return an error, while the latter will just
    stop parsing, e.g.  simple_strtoul("123xyx") = 123.
    
    The kernel cmdline reboot= argument allows to specify the CPU used for
    rebooting, with the syntax `s####` among the other flags, e.g.
    "reboot=warm,s31,force", so if this flag is not the last given, it's
    silently ignored as well as the subsequent ones.

    perf/core: Fix race in the perf_mmap_close() function
    
    commit f91072ed1b7283b13ca57fcfbece5a3b92726143 upstream.
    
    There's a possible race in perf_mmap_close() when checking ring buffer's
    mmap_count refcount value. The problem is that the mmap_count check is
    not atomic because we call atomic_dec() and atomic_read() separately.
    
      perf_mmap_close:
      ...
       atomic_dec(&rb->mmap_count);
       ...
       if (atomic_read(&rb->mmap_count))
          goto out_put;
    
       <ring buffer detach>
       free_uid
    
    out_put:
      ring_buffer_put(rb); /* could be last */
    
    The race can happen when we have two (or more) events sharing same ring
    buffer and they go through atomic_dec() and then they both see 0 as refcount
    value later in atomic_read(). Then both will go on and execute code which
    is meant to be run just once.
    
    The code that detaches ring buffer is probably fine to be executed more
    than once, but the problem is in calling free_uid(), which will later on
    demonstrate in related crashes and refcount warnings, like:
    
      refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
      ...

    xen/events: block rogue events for some time
    
    commit 5f7f77400ab5b357b5fdb7122c3442239672186c upstream.
    
    In order to avoid high dom0 load due to rogue guests sending events at
    high frequency, block those events in case there was no action needed
    in dom0 to handle the events.
    
    This is done by adding a per-event counter, which set to zero in case
    an EOI without the XEN_EOI_FLAG_SPURIOUS is received from a backend
    driver, and incremented when this flag has been set. In case the
    counter is 2 or higher delay the EOI by 1 << (cnt - 2) jiffies, but
    not more than 1 second.
    
    In order not to waste memory shorten the per-event refcnt to two bytes
    (it should normally never exceed a value of 2). Add an overflow check
    to evtchn_get() to make sure the 2 bytes really won't overflow.
    
    This is part of XSA-332.

    xen/events: defer eoi in case of excessive number of events
    
    commit e99502f76271d6bc4e374fe368c50c67a1fd3070 upstream.
    
    In case rogue guests are sending events at high frequency it might
    happen that xen_evtchn_do_upcall() won't stop processing events in
    dom0. As this is done in irq handling a crash might be the result.
    
    In order to avoid that, delay further inter-domain events after some
    time in xen_evtchn_do_upcall() by forcing eoi processing into a
    worker on the same cpu, thus inhibiting new events coming in.
    
    The time after which eoi processing is to be delayed is configurable
    via a new module parameter "event_loop_timeout" which specifies the
    maximum event loop time in jiffies (default: 2, the value was chosen
    after some tests showing that a value of 2 was the lowest with an
    only slight drop of dom0 network throughput while multiple guests
    performed an event storm).
    
    How long eoi processing will be delayed can be specified via another
    parameter "event_eoi_delay" (again in jiffies, default 10, again the
    value was chosen after testing with different delay values).
    
    This is part of XSA-332.

    xen/pciback: use lateeoi irq binding
    
    commit c2711441bc961b37bba0615dd7135857d189035f upstream.
    
    In order to reduce the chance for the system becoming unresponsive due
    to event storms triggered by a misbehaving pcifront use the lateeoi irq
    binding for pciback and unmask the event channel only just before
    leaving the event handling function.
    
    Restructure the handling to support that scheme. Basically an event can
    come in for two reasons: either a normal request for a pciback action,
    which is handled in a worker, or in case the guest has finished an AER
    request which was requested by pciback.
    
    When an AER request is issued to the guest and a normal pciback action
    is currently active issue an EOI early in order to be able to receive
    another event when the AER request has been finished by the guest.
    
    Let the worker processing the normal requests run until no further
    request is pending, instead of starting a new worker ion that case.
    Issue the EOI only just before leaving the worker.
    
    This scheme allows to drop calling the generic function
    xen_pcibk_test_and_schedule_op() after processing of any request as
    the handling of both request types is now separated more cleanly.
    
    This is part of XSA-332.

    xen/pvcallsback: use lateeoi irq binding
    
    commit c8d647a326f06a39a8e5f0f1af946eacfa1835f8 upstream.
    
    In order to reduce the chance for the system becoming unresponsive due
    to event storms triggered by a misbehaving pvcallsfront use the lateeoi
    irq binding for pvcallsback and unmask the event channel only after
    handling all write requests, which are the ones coming in via an irq.
    
    This requires modifying the logic a little bit to not require an event
    for each write request, but to keep the ioworker running until no
    further data is found on the ring page to be processed.

    xen/scsiback: use lateeoi irq binding
    
    commit 86991b6e7ea6c613b7692f65106076943449b6b7 upstream.
    
    In order to reduce the chance for the system becoming unresponsive due
    to event storms triggered by a misbehaving scsifront use the lateeoi
    irq binding for scsiback and unmask the event channel only just before
    leaving the event handling function.
    
    In case of a ring protocol error don't issue an EOI in order to avoid
    the possibility to use that for producing an event storm. This at once
    will result in no further call of scsiback_irq_fn(), so the ring_error
    struct member can be dropped and scsiback_do_cmd_fn() can signal the
    protocol error via a negative return value.

    xen/events: add a new "late EOI" evtchn framework
    
    commit 54c9de89895e0a36047fcc4ae754ea5b8655fb9d upstream.
    
    In order to avoid tight event channel related IRQ loops add a new
    framework of "late EOI" handling: the IRQ the event channel is bound
    to will be masked until the event has been handled and the related
    driver is capable to handle another event. The driver is responsible
    for unmasking the event channel via the new function xen_irq_lateeoi().
    
    This is similar to binding an event channel to a threaded IRQ, but
    without having to structure the driver accordingly.
    
    In order to support a future special handling in case a rogue guest
    is sending lots of unsolicited events, add a flag to xen_irq_lateeoi()
    which can be set by the caller to indicate the event was a spurious
    one.
    
    This is part of XSA-332.

    Unmasking a fifo event channel can result in unmasking it twice, once

    xen/events: add a proper barrier to 2-level uevent unmasking
    
    commit 4d3fe31bd993ef504350989786858aefdb877daa upstream.
    
    A follow-up patch will require certain write to happen before an event
    channel is unmasked.
    
    While the memory barrier is not strictly necessary for all the callers,
    the main one will need it. In order to avoid an extra memory barrier
    when using fifo event channels, mandate evtchn_unmask() to provide
    write ordering.
    
    The 2-level event handling unmask operation is missing an appropriate
    barrier, so add it. Fifo event channels are fine in this regard due to
    using sync_cmpxchg().
    
    This is part of XSA-332.

    xen/events: avoid removing an event channel while handling it
    
    commit 073d0552ead5bfc7a3a9c01de590e924f11b5dd2 upstream.
    
    Today it can happen that an event channel is being removed from the
    system while the event handling loop is active. This can lead to a
    race resulting in crashes or WARN() splats when trying to access the
    irq_info structure related to the event channel.
    
    Fix this problem by using a rwlock taken as reader in the event
    handling loop and as writer when deallocating the irq_info structure.
    
    As the observed problem was a NULL dereference in evtchn_from_irq()
    make this function more robust against races by testing the irq_info
    pointer to be not NULL before dereferencing it.
    
    And finally make all accesses to evtchn_to_irq[row][col] atomic ones
    in order to avoid seeing partial updates of an array element in irq
    handling. Note that irq handling can be entered only for event channels
    which have been valid before, so any not populated row isn't a problem
    in this regard, as rows are only ever added and never removed.
    
    This is XSA-331.

    perf/core: Fix a memory leak in perf_event_parse_addr_filter()
    
    commit 7bdb157cdebbf95a1cd94ed2e01b338714075d00 upstream
    
    As shown through runtime testing, the "filename" allocation is not
    always freed in perf_event_parse_addr_filter().
    
    There are three possible ways that this could happen:
    
     - It could be allocated twice on subsequent iterations through the loop,
     - or leaked on the success path,
     - or on the failure path.
    
    Clean up the code flow to make it obvious that 'filename' is always
    freed in the reallocation path and in the two return paths as well.
    
    We rely on the fact that kfree(NULL) is NOP and filename is initialized
    with NULL.
    
    This fixes the leak. No other side effects expected.

    the value is not expected to be NULL, resulting in the following splat:

    perf/core: Fix bad use of igrab()
    
    commit 9511bce9fe8e5e6c0f923c09243a713eba560141 upstream
    
    As Miklos reported and suggested:
    
     "This pattern repeats two times in trace_uprobe.c and in
      kernel/events/core.c as well:
    
          ret = kern_path(filename, LOOKUP_FOLLOW, &path);
          if (ret)
              goto fail_address_parse;
    
          inode = igrab(d_inode(path.dentry));
          path_put(&path);
    
      And it's wrong.  You can only hold a reference to the inode if you
      have an active ref to the superblock as well (which is normally
      through path.mnt) or holding s_umount.
    
      This way unmounting the containing filesystem while the tracepoint is
      active will give you the "VFS: Busy inodes after unmount..." message
      and a crash when the inode is finally put.
    
      Solution: store path instead of inode."
    
    This patch fixes the issue in kernel/event/core.c.

    x86/speculation: Allow IBPB to be conditionally enabled on CPUs with always-on STIBP
    
    commit 1978b3a53a74e3230cd46932b149c6e62e832e9a upstream.
    
    On AMD CPUs which have the feature X86_FEATURE_AMD_STIBP_ALWAYS_ON,
    STIBP is set to on and
    
      spectre_v2_user_stibp == SPECTRE_V2_USER_STRICT_PREFERRED
    
    At the same time, IBPB can be set to conditional.
    
    However, this leads to the case where it's impossible to turn on IBPB
    for a process because in the PR_SPEC_DISABLE case in ib_prctl_set() the
    
      spectre_v2_user_stibp == SPECTRE_V2_USER_STRICT_PREFERRED
    
    condition leads to a return before the task flag is set. Similarly,
    ib_prctl_get() will return PR_SPEC_DISABLE even though IBPB is set to
    conditional.
    
    More generally, the following cases are possible:
    
    1. STIBP = conditional && IBPB = on for spectre_v2_user=seccomp,ibpb
    2. STIBP = on && IBPB = conditional for AMD CPUs with
       X86_FEATURE_AMD_STIBP_ALWAYS_ON
    
    The first case functions correctly today, but only because
    spectre_v2_user_ibpb isn't updated to reflect the IBPB mode.
    
    At a high level, this change does one thing. If either STIBP or IBPB
    is set to conditional, allow the prctl to change the task flag.
    Also, reflect that capability when querying the state. This isn't
    perfect since it doesn't take into account if only STIBP or IBPB is
    unconditionally on. But it allows the conditional feature to work as
    expected, without affecting the unconditional one.

    random32: make prandom_u32() output unpredictable
    
    commit c51f8f88d705e06bd696d7510aff22b33eb8e638 upstream.
    
    Non-cryptographic PRNGs may have great statistical properties, but
    are usually trivially predictable to someone who knows the algorithm,
    given a small sample of their output.  An LFSR like prandom_u32() is
    particularly simple, even if the sample is widely scattered bits.
    
    It turns out the network stack uses prandom_u32() for some things like
    random port numbers which it would prefer are *not* trivially predictable.
    Predictability led to a practical DNS spoofing attack.  Oops.
    
    This patch replaces the LFSR with a homebrew cryptographic PRNG based
    on the SipHash round function, which is in turn seeded with 128 bits
    of strong random key.  (The authors of SipHash have *not* been consulted
    about this abuse of their algorithm.)  Speed is prioritized over security;
    attacks are rare, while performance is always wanted.
    
    Replacing all callers of prandom_u32() is the quick fix.
    Whether to reinstate a weaker PRNG for uses which can tolerate it
    is an open question.
    
    Commit f227e3ec3b5c ("random32: update the net random state on interrupt
    and activity") was an earlier attempt at a solution.  This patch replaces
    it.

    net: Update window_clamp if SOCK_RCVBUF is set

    still operates with initial window scale and can overshot
    granted window, the client use the initial scale but local
    server use new scale to advertise window value, and session

    The caller of rtl8169_tso_csum_v2() frees the skb if false is returned.
    eth_skb_pad() internally frees the skb on error what would result in a

    vrf: Fix fast path output packet handling with async Netfilter rules
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e2b7fa2df4365e99934901da4fb4af52d81e820 ]
    
    VRF devices use an optimized direct path on output if a default qdisc
    is involved, calling Netfilter hooks directly. This path, however, does
    not consider Netfilter rules completing asynchronously, such as with
    NFQUEUE. The Netfilter okfn() is called for asynchronously accepted
    packets, but the VRF never passes that packet down the stack to send
    it out over the slave device. Using the slower redirect path for this
    seems not feasible, as we do not know beforehand if a Netfilter hook
    has asynchronously completing rules.
    
    Fix the use of asynchronously completing Netfilter rules in OUTPUT and
    POSTROUTING by using a special completion function that additionally
    calls dst_output() to pass the packet down the stack. Also, slightly
    adjust the use of nf_reset_ct() so that is called in the asynchronous
    case, too.

    IPv6: Set SIT tunnel hard_header_len to zero
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ef9ba4d666614497a057d09b0a6eafc1e34eadf ]
    
    Due to the legacy usage of hard_header_len for SIT tunnels while
    already using infrastructure from net/ipv4/ip_tunnel.c the
    calculation of the path MTU in tnl_update_pmtu is incorrect.
    This leads to unnecessary creation of MTU exceptions for any
    flow going over a SIT tunnel.
    
    As SIT tunnels do not have a header themsevles other than their
    transport (L3, L2) headers we're leaving hard_header_len set to zero
    as tnl_update_pmtu is already taking care of the transport headers
    sizes.
    
    This will also help avoiding unnecessary IPv6 GC runs and spinlock
    contention seen when using SIT tunnels and for more than
    net.ipv6.route.gc_thresh flows.

    swiotlb: fix "x86: Don't panic if can not alloc buffer for swiotlb"
    
    commit e9696d259d0fb5d239e8c28ca41089838ea76d13 upstream.
    
    kernel/dma/swiotlb.c:swiotlb_init gets called first and tries to
    allocate a buffer for the swiotlb. It does so by calling
    
      memblock_alloc_low(PAGE_ALIGN(bytes), PAGE_SIZE);
    
    If the allocation must fail, no_iotlb_memory is set.
    
    Later during initialization swiotlb-xen comes in
    (drivers/xen/swiotlb-xen.c:xen_swiotlb_init) and given that io_tlb_start
    is != 0, it thinks the memory is ready to use when actually it is not.
    
    When the swiotlb is actually needed, swiotlb_tbl_map_single gets called
    and since no_iotlb_memory is set the kernel panics.
    
    Instead, if swiotlb-xen.c:xen_swiotlb_init knew the swiotlb hadn't been
    initialized, it would do the initialization itself, which might still
    succeed.
    
    Fix the panic by setting io_tlb_start to 0 on swiotlb initialization
    failure, and also by setting no_iotlb_memory to false on swiotlb
    initialization success.

    don't dump the threads that had been already exiting when zapped.
    
    commit 77f6ab8b7768cf5e6bdd0e72499270a0671506ee upstream.
    
    Coredump logics needs to report not only the registers of the dumping
    thread, but (since 2.5.43) those of other threads getting killed.
    
    Doing that might require extra state saved on the stack in asm glue at
    kernel entry; signal delivery logics does that (we need to be able to
    save sigcontext there, at the very least) and so does seccomp.
    
    That covers all callers of do_coredump().  Secondary threads get hit with
    SIGKILL and caught as soon as they reach exit_mm(), which normally happens
    in signal delivery, so those are also fine most of the time.  Unfortunately,
    it is possible to end up with secondary zapped when it has already entered
    exit(2) (or, worse yet, is oopsing).  In those cases we reach exit_mm()
    when mm->core_state is already set, but the stack contents is not what
    we would have in signal delivery.
    
    At least on two architectures (alpha and m68k) it leads to infoleaks - we
    end up with a chunk of kernel stack written into coredump, with the contents
    consisting of normal C stack frames of the call chain leading to exit_mm()
    instead of the expected copy of userland registers.  In case of alpha we
    leak 312 bytes of stack.  Other architectures (including the regset-using
    ones) might have similar problems - the normal user of regsets is ptrace
    and the state of tracee at the time of such calls is special in the same
    way signal delivery is.
    
    Note that had the zapper gotten to the exiting thread slightly later,
    it wouldn't have been included into coredump anyway - we skip the threads
    that have already cleared their ->mm.  So let's pretend that zapper always
    loses the race.  IOW, have exit_mm() only insert into the dumper list if
    we'd gotten there from handling a fatal signal[*]
    
    As the result, the callers of do_exit() that have *not* gone through get_signal()
    are not seen by coredump logics as secondary threads.  Which excludes voluntary
    exit()/oopsen/traps/etc.  The dumper thread itself is unaffected by that,
    so seccomp is fine.
    
    [*] originally I intended to add a new flag in tsk->flags, but ebiederman pointed
    out that PF_SIGNALED is already doing just what we need.

    ocfs2: initialize ip_next_orphan
    
    commit f5785283dd64867a711ca1fb1f5bb172f252ecdf upstream.
    
    Though problem if found on a lower 4.1.12 kernel, I think upstream has
    same issue.
    
    In one node in the cluster, there is the following callback trace:
    
       # cat /proc/21473/stack
       __ocfs2_cluster_lock.isra.36+0x336/0x9e0 [ocfs2]
       ocfs2_inode_lock_full_nested+0x121/0x520 [ocfs2]
       ocfs2_evict_inode+0x152/0x820 [ocfs2]
       evict+0xae/0x1a0
       iput+0x1c6/0x230
       ocfs2_orphan_filldir+0x5d/0x100 [ocfs2]
       ocfs2_dir_foreach_blk+0x490/0x4f0 [ocfs2]
       ocfs2_dir_foreach+0x29/0x30 [ocfs2]
       ocfs2_recover_orphans+0x1b6/0x9a0 [ocfs2]
       ocfs2_complete_recovery+0x1de/0x5c0 [ocfs2]
       process_one_work+0x169/0x4a0
       worker_thread+0x5b/0x560
       kthread+0xcb/0xf0
       ret_from_fork+0x61/0x90
    
    The above stack is not reasonable, the final iput shouldn't happen in
    ocfs2_orphan_filldir() function.  Looking at the code,
    
      2067         /* Skip inodes which are already added to recover list, since dio may
      2068          * happen concurrently with unlink/rename */
      2069         if (OCFS2_I(iter)->ip_next_orphan) {
      2070                 iput(iter);
      2071                 return 0;
      2072         }
      2073
    
    The logic thinks the inode is already in recover list on seeing
    ip_next_orphan is non-NULL, so it skip this inode after dropping a
    reference which incremented in ocfs2_iget().
    
    While, if the inode is already in recover list, it should have another
    reference and the iput() at line 2070 should not be the final iput
    (dropping the last reference).  So I don't think the inode is really in
    the recover list (no vmcore to confirm).
    
    Note that ocfs2_queue_orphans(), though not shown up in the call back
    trace, is holding cluster lock on the orphan directory when looking up
    for unlinked inodes.  The on disk inode eviction could involve a lot of
    IOs which may need long time to finish.  That means this node could hold
    the cluster lock for very long time, that can lead to the lock requests
    (from other nodes) to the orhpan directory hang for long time.
    
    Looking at more on ip_next_orphan, I found it's not initialized when
    allocating a new ocfs2_inode_info structure.
    
    This causes te reflink operations from some nodes hang for very long
    time waiting for the cluster lock on the orphan directory.
    
    Fix: initialize ip_next_orphan as NULL.

    futex: Don't enable IRQs unconditionally in put_pi_state()
    
    commit 1e106aa3509b86738769775969822ffc1ec21bf4 upstream.
    
    The exit_pi_state_list() function calls put_pi_state() with IRQs disabled
    and is not expecting that IRQs will be enabled inside the function.
    
    Use the _irqsave() variant so that IRQs are restored to the original state
    instead of being enabled unconditionally.

    A receive callback is queued while the client is still connected
    but can still be called after the client was disconnected. Upon
    disconnect cl->me_cl is set to NULL, hence we need to check

    uio: Fix use-after-free in uio_unregister_device()
    
    commit 092561f06702dd4fdd7fb74dd3a838f1818529b7 upstream.
    
    Commit 8fd0e2a6df26 ("uio: free uio id after uio file node is freed")
    triggered KASAN use-after-free failure at deletion of TCM-user
    backstores [1].
    
    In uio_unregister_device(), struct uio_device *idev is passed to
    uio_free_minor() to refer idev->minor. However, before uio_free_minor()
    call, idev is already freed by uio_device_release() during call to
    device_unregister().
    
    To avoid reference to idev->minor after idev free, keep idev->minor
    value in a local variable. Also modify uio_free_minor() argument to
    receive the value.

    ext4: correctly report "not supported" for {usr,grp}jquota when !CONFIG_QUOTA
    
    commit 174fe5ba2d1ea0d6c5ab2a7d4aa058d6d497ae4d upstream.
    
    The macro MOPT_Q is used to indicates the mount option is related to
    quota stuff and is defined to be MOPT_NOSUPPORT when CONFIG_QUOTA is
    disabled.  Normally the quota options are handled explicitly, so it
    didn't matter that the MOPT_STRING flag was missing, even though the
    usrjquota and grpjquota mount options take a string argument.  It's
    important that's present in the !CONFIG_QUOTA case, since without
    MOPT_STRING, the mount option matcher will match usrjquota= followed
    by an integer, and will otherwise skip the table entry, and so "mount
    option not supported" error message is never reported.
    
    [ Fixed up the commit description to better explain why the fix
      works. --TYT ]

    Commit dabf6b36b83a ("of: Add OF_DMA_DEFAULT_COHERENT & select it on
    powerpc") added a check to of_dma_is_coherent which returns early
    if OF_DMA_DEFAULT_COHERENT is enabled. This results in the of_node_put()
    being skipped causing a memory leak. Moved the of_node_get() below this
    check so we now we only get the node if OF_DMA_DEFAULT_COHERENT is not
    enabled.

    xfs: fix rmap key and record comparison functions
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ff646b2ceb0eec916101877f38da0b73e3a5b7f ]
    
    Keys for extent interval records in the reverse mapping btree are
    supposed to be computed as follows:
    
    (physical block, owner, fork, is_btree, is_unwritten, offset)
    
    This provides users the ability to look up a reverse mapping from a bmbt
    record -- start with the physical block; then if there are multiple
    records for the same block, move on to the owner; then the inode fork
    type; and so on to the file offset.
    
    However, the key comparison functions incorrectly remove the
    fork/btree/unwritten information that's encoded in the on-disk offset.
    This means that lookup comparisons are only done with:
    
    (physical block, owner, offset)
    
    This means that queries can return incorrect results.  On consistent
    filesystems this hasn't been an issue because blocks are never shared
    between forks or with bmbt blocks; and are never unwritten.  However,
    this bug means that online repair cannot always detect corruption in the
    key information in internal rmapbt nodes.
    
    Found by fuzzing keys[1].attrfork = ones on xfs/371.

    ARM: 9019/1: kprobes: Avoid fortify_panic() when copying optprobe template
    
    [ Upstream commit 9fa2e7af3d53a4b769136eccc32c02e128a4ee51 ]
    
    Setting both CONFIG_KPROBES=y and CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE=y on ARM leads
    to a panic in memcpy() when injecting a kprobe despite the fixes found
    in commit e46daee53bb5 ("ARM: 8806/1: kprobes: Fix false positive with
    FORTIFY_SOURCE") and commit 0ac569bf6a79 ("ARM: 8834/1: Fix: kprobes:
    optimized kprobes illegal instruction").
    
    arch/arm/include/asm/kprobes.h effectively declares
    the target type of the optprobe_template_entry assembly label as a u32
    which leads memcpy()'s __builtin_object_size() call to determine that
    the pointed-to object is of size four. However, the symbol is used as a handle
    for the optimised probe assembly template that is at least 96 bytes in size.
    The symbol's use despite its type blows up the memcpy() in ARM's
    arch_prepare_optimized_kprobe() with a false-positive fortify_panic() when it
    should instead copy the optimised probe template into place:

    pinctrl: intel: Set default bias in case no particular value given
    
    [ Upstream commit f3c75e7a9349d1d33eb53ddc1b31640994969f73 ]
    
    When GPIO library asks pin control to set the bias, it doesn't pass
    any value of it and argument is considered boolean (and this is true
    for ACPI GpioIo() / GpioInt() resources, by the way). Thus, individual
    drivers must behave well, when they got the resistance value of 1 Ohm,
    i.e. transforming it to sane default.
    
    In case of Intel pin control hardware the 5 kOhm sounds plausible
    because on one hand it's a minimum of resistors present in all
    hardware generations and at the same time it's high enough to minimize
    leakage current (will be only 200 uA with the above choice).

    iommu/amd: Increase interrupt remapping table limit to 512 entries
    
    [ Upstream commit 73db2fc595f358460ce32bcaa3be1f0cce4a2db1 ]
    
    Certain device drivers allocate IO queues on a per-cpu basis.
    On AMD EPYC platform, which can support up-to 256 cpu threads,
    this can exceed the current MAX_IRQ_PER_TABLE limit of 256,
    and result in the error message:
    
        AMD-Vi: Failed to allocate IRTE
    
    This has been observed with certain NVME devices.
    
    AMD IOMMU hardware can actually support upto 512 interrupt
    remapping table entries. Therefore, update the driver to
    match the hardware limit.
    
    Please note that this also increases the size of interrupt remapping
    table to 8KB per device when using the 128-bit IRTE format.

    [ Upstream commit 5faf50e9e9fdc2117c61ff7e20da49cd6a29e0ca ]
    
    alua_bus_detach() might be running concurrently with alua_rtpg_work(), so
    we might trip over h->sdev == NULL and call BUG_ON().  The correct way of
    handling it is to not set h->sdev to NULL in alua_bus_detach(), and call
    rcu_synchronize() before the final delete to ensure that all concurrent
    threads have left the critical section.  Then we can get rid of the
    BUG_ON() and replace it with a simple if condition.

    mac80211: fix use of skb payload instead of header
    
    [ Upstream commit 14f46c1e5108696ec1e5a129e838ecedf108c7bf ]
    
    When ieee80211_skb_resize() is called from ieee80211_build_hdr()
    the skb has no 802.11 header yet, in fact it consist only of the
    payload as the ethernet frame is removed. As such, we're using
    the payload data for ieee80211_is_mgmt(), which is of course
    completely wrong. This didn't really hurt us because these are
    always data frames, so we could only have added more tailroom
    than we needed if we determined it was a management frame and
    sdata->crypto_tx_tailroom_needed_cnt was false.
    
    However, syzbot found that of course there need not be any payload,
    so we're using at best uninitialized memory for the check.
    
    Fix this to pass explicitly the kind of frame that we have instead
    of checking there, by replacing the "bool may_encrypt" argument
    with an argument that can carry the three possible states - it's
    not going to be encrypted, it's a management frame, or it's a data
    frame (and then we check sdata->crypto_tx_tailroom_needed_cnt).

    gfs2: check for live vs. read-only file system in gfs2_fitrim
    
    [ Upstream commit c5c68724696e7d2f8db58a5fce3673208d35c485 ]
    
    Before this patch, gfs2_fitrim was not properly checking for a "live" file
    system. If the file system had something to trim and the file system
    was read-only (or spectator) it would start the trim, but when it starts
    the transaction, gfs2_trans_begin returns -EROFS (read-only file system)
    and it errors out. However, if the file system was already trimmed so
    there's no work to do, it never called gfs2_trans_begin. That code is
    bypassed so it never returns the error. Instead, it returns a good
    return code with 0 work. All this makes for inconsistent behavior:
    The same fstrim command can return -EROFS in one case and 0 in another.
    This tripped up xfstests generic/537 which reports the error as:
    
        +fstrim with unrecovered metadata just ate your filesystem
    
    This patch adds a check for a "live" (iow, active journal, iow, RW)
    file system, and if not, returns the error properly.

    gfs2: Add missing truncate_inode_pages_final for sd_aspace
    
    [ Upstream commit a9dd945ccef07a904e412f208f8de708a3d7159e ]
    
    Gfs2 creates an address space for its rgrps called sd_aspace, but it never
    called truncate_inode_pages_final on it. This confused vfs greatly which
    tried to reference the address space after gfs2 had freed the superblock
    that contained it.
    
    This patch adds a call to truncate_inode_pages_final for sd_aspace, thus
    avoiding the use-after-free.

    [ Upstream commit 0d66e04875c5aae876cf3d4f4be7978fa2b00523 ]
    
    goku_probe() goes to error label "err" and invokes goku_remove()
    in case of failures of pci_enable_device(), pci_resource_start()
    and ioremap(). goku_remove() gets a device from
    pci_get_drvdata(pdev) and works with it without any checks, in
    particular it dereferences a corresponding pointer. But
    goku_probe() did not set this device yet. So, one can expect
    various crashes. The patch moves setting the device just after
    allocation of memory for it.

    Btrfs: fix missing error return if writeback for extent buffer never started
    
    [ Upstream commit 0607eb1d452d45c5ac4c745a9e9e0d95152ea9d0 ]
    
    If lock_extent_buffer_for_io() fails, it returns a negative value, but its
    caller btree_write_cache_pages() ignores such error. This means that a
    call to flush_write_bio(), from lock_extent_buffer_for_io(), might have
    failed. We should make btree_write_cache_pages() notice such error values
    and stop immediatelly, making sure filemap_fdatawrite_range() returns an
    error to the transaction commit path. A failure from flush_write_bio()
    should also result in the endio callback end_bio_extent_buffer_writepage()
    being invoked, which sets the BTRFS_FS_*_ERR bits appropriately, so that
    there's no risk a transaction or log commit doesn't catch a writeback
    failure.

    xfs: flush new eof page on truncate to avoid post-eof corruption
    
    [ Upstream commit 869ae85dae64b5540e4362d7fe4cd520e10ec05c ]
    
    It is possible to expose non-zeroed post-EOF data in XFS if the new
    EOF page is dirty, backed by an unwritten block and the truncate
    happens to race with writeback. iomap_truncate_page() will not zero
    the post-EOF portion of the page if the underlying block is
    unwritten. The subsequent call to truncate_setsize() will, but
    doesn't dirty the page. Therefore, if writeback happens to complete
    after iomap_truncate_page() (so it still sees the unwritten block)
    but before truncate_setsize(), the cached page becomes inconsistent
    with the on-disk block. A mapped read after the associated page is
    reclaimed or invalidated exposes non-zero post-EOF data.
    
    For example, consider the following sequence when run on a kernel
    modified to explicitly flush the new EOF page within the race
    window:
    
    $ xfs_io -fc "falloc 0 4k" -c fsync /mnt/file
    $ xfs_io -c "pwrite 0 4k" -c "truncate 1k" /mnt/file
      ...
    $ xfs_io -c "mmap 0 4k" -c "mread -v 1k 8" /mnt/file
    00000400:  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ........
    $ umount /mnt/; mount <dev> /mnt/
    $ xfs_io -c "mmap 0 4k" -c "mread -v 1k 8" /mnt/file
    00000400:  cd cd cd cd cd cd cd cd  ........
    
    Update xfs_setattr_size() to explicitly flush the new EOF page prior
    to the page truncate to ensure iomap has the latest state of the
    underlying block.

    can: peak_canfd: pucan_handle_can_rx(): fix echo management when loopback is on
    
    [ Upstream commit 93ef65e5a6357cc7381f85fcec9283fe29970045 ]
    
    Echo management is driven by PUCAN_MSG_LOOPED_BACK bit, while loopback
    frames are identified with PUCAN_MSG_SELF_RECEIVE bit. Those bits are set
    for each outgoing frame written to the IP core so that a copy of each one
    will be placed into the rx path. Thus,
    
    - when PUCAN_MSG_LOOPED_BACK is set then the rx frame is an echo of a
      previously sent frame,
    - when PUCAN_MSG_LOOPED_BACK+PUCAN_MSG_SELF_RECEIVE are set, then the rx
      frame is an echo AND a loopback frame. Therefore, this frame must be
      put into the socket rx path too.
    
    This patch fixes how CAN frames are handled when these are sent while the
    can interface is configured in "loopback on" mode.

    [ Upstream commit ecc7b4187dd388549544195fb13a11b4ea8e6a84 ]
    
    Fabian Inostroza <fabianinostrozap@gmail.com> has discovered a potential
    problem in the hardware timestamp reporting from the PCAN-USB USB CAN interface
    (only), related to the fact that a timestamp of an event may precede the
    timestamp used for synchronization when both records are part of the same USB
    packet. However, this case was used to detect the wrapping of the time counter.
    
    This patch details and fixes the two identified cases where this problem can

    These values come from skb->data so Smatch considers them untrusted.  I
    believe Smatch is correct but I don't have a way to test this.
    
    The usb_if->dev[] array has 2 elements but the index is in the 0-15
    range without checks.  The cfd->len can be up to 255 but the maximum
    valid size is CANFD_MAX_DLEN (64) so that could lead to memory

    can: can_create_echo_skb(): fix echo skb generation: always use skb_clone()
    
    [ Upstream commit 286228d382ba6320f04fa2e7c6fc8d4d92e428f4 ]
    
    All user space generated SKBs are owned by a socket (unless injected into the
    key via AF_PACKET). If a socket is closed, all associated skbs will be cleaned
    up.
    
    This leads to a problem when a CAN driver calls can_put_echo_skb() on a
    unshared SKB. If the socket is closed prior to the TX complete handler,
    can_get_echo_skb() and the subsequent delivering of the echo SKB to all
    registered callbacks, a SKB with a refcount of 0 is delivered.
    
    To avoid the problem, in can_get_echo_skb() the original SKB is now always
    cloned, regardless of shared SKB or not. If the process exists it can now
    safely discard its SKBs, without disturbing the delivery of the echo SKB.
    
    The problem shows up in the j1939 stack, when it clones the incoming skb, which
    detects the already 0 refcount.
    
    We can easily reproduce this with following example:
    
    testj1939 -B -r can0: &
    cansend can0 1823ff40#0123

    The can_get_echo_skb() function returns the number of received bytes to
    be used for netdev statistics. In the case of RTR frames we get a valid
    (potential non-zero) data length value which has to be passed for further
    operations. But on the wire RTR frames have no payload length. Therefore
    the value to be used in the statistics has to be zero for RTR frames.

    can: dev: can_get_echo_skb(): prevent call to kfree_skb() in hard IRQ context
    
    [ Upstream commit 2283f79b22684d2812e5c76fc2280aae00390365 ]
    
    If a driver calls can_get_echo_skb() during a hardware IRQ (which is often, but
    not always, the case), the 'WARN_ON(in_irq)' in
    net/core/skbuff.c#skb_release_head_state() might be triggered, under network
    congestion circumstances, together with the potential risk of a NULL pointer
    dereference.
    
    The root cause of this issue is the call to kfree_skb() instead of
    dev_kfree_skb_irq() in net/core/dev.c#enqueue_to_backlog().
    
    This patch prevents the skb to be freed within the call to netif_rx() by
    incrementing its reference count with skb_get(). The skb is finally freed by
    one of the in-irq-context safe functions: dev_consume_skb_any() or
    dev_kfree_skb_any(). The "any" version is used because some drivers might call
    can_get_echo_skb() in a normal context.
    
    The reason for this issue to occur is that initially, in the core network
    stack, loopback skb were not supposed to be received in hardware IRQ context.
    The CAN stack is an exeption.
    
    This bug was previously reported back in 2017 in [1] but the proposed patch
    never got accepted.
    
    While [1] directly modifies net/core/dev.c, we try to propose here a
    smoother modification local to CAN network stack (the assumption
    behind is that only CAN devices are affected by this issue).

    In case the rx-offload queue is full, trying to add more skbs results in the
    skbs being dropped using kfree_skb(). If done from hard-IRQ context this
    results in the following warning:

    This is harmless, but the "addr" comes from the user and it could lead
    to a negative shift or to shift wrapping if it's too high.

    net: xfrm: fix a race condition during allocing spi
    
    [ Upstream commit a779d91314ca7208b7feb3ad817b62904397c56d ]
    
    we found that the following race condition exists in
    xfrm_alloc_userspi flow:
    
    user thread                                    state_hash_work thread
    ----                                           ----
    xfrm_alloc_userspi()
     __find_acq_core()
       /*alloc new xfrm_state:x*/
       xfrm_state_alloc()
       /*schedule state_hash_work thread*/
       xfrm_hash_grow_check()                      xfrm_hash_resize()
     xfrm_alloc_spi                                  /*hold lock*/
          x->id.spi = htonl(spi)                     spin_lock_bh(&net->xfrm.xfrm_state_lock)
          /*waiting lock release*/                     xfrm_hash_transfer()
          spin_lock_bh(&net->xfrm.xfrm_state_lock)      /*add x into hlist:net->xfrm.state_byspi*/
                                                            hlist_add_head_rcu(&x->byspi)
                                                     spin_unlock_bh(&net->xfrm.xfrm_state_lock)
    
        /*add x into hlist:net->xfrm.state_byspi 2 times*/
        hlist_add_head_rcu(&x->byspi)
    
    1. a new state x is alloced in xfrm_state_alloc() and added into the bydst hlist
    in  __find_acq_core() on the LHS;
    2. on the RHS, state_hash_work thread travels the old bydst and tranfers every xfrm_state
    (include x) into the new bydst hlist and new byspi hlist;
    3. user thread on the LHS gets the lock and adds x into the new byspi hlist again.
    
    So the same xfrm_state (x) is added into the same list_hash
    (net->xfrm.state_byspi) 2 times that makes the list_hash become
    an inifite loop.
    
    To fix the race, x->id.spi = htonl(spi) in the xfrm_alloc_spi() is moved
    to the back of spin_lock_bh, sothat state_hash_work thread no longer add x
    which id.spi is zero into the hash_list.

    All of these lockup reports have the call chain btrfs_clone_files() ->
    btrfs_clone() in common. btrfs_clone_files() calls btrfs_clone() with
    both source and destination extents locked and loops over the source
    extent to create the clones.
    
    Conditionally reschedule in the btrfs_clone() loop, to give some time back
    to other processes.

    This happens because we are holding the chunk_mutex at the time of
    adding in a new device.  However we only need to hold the
    device_list_mutex, as we're going to iterate over the fs_devices
    devices.  Move the sysfs init stuff outside of the chunk_mutex to get
    rid of this lockdep splat.

    nbd: don't update block size after device is started
    
    [ Upstream commit b40813ddcd6bf9f01d020804e4cb8febc480b9e4 ]
    
    Mounted NBD device can be resized, one use case is rbd-nbd.
    
    Fix the issue by setting up default block size, then not touch it
    in nbd_size_update() any more. This kind of usage is aligned with loop
    which has same use case too.

    replaced the original conversion which handled time clamping correctly with
    timespec64_to_ns() which has no overflow protection.
    
    Fix it in timespec64_to_ns() as this is not necessarily limited to the
    usage in itimers.

    mm: mempolicy: fix potential pte_unmap_unlock pte error
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f08842098e842c51e3b97d0dcdebf810b32558e ]
    
    When flags in queue_pages_pte_range don't have MPOL_MF_MOVE or
    MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL bits, code breaks and passing origin pte - 1 to
    pte_unmap_unlock seems like not a good idea.
    
    queue_pages_pte_range can run in MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL mode which doesn't
    migrate misplaced pages but returns with EIO when encountering such a
    page.  Since commit a7f40cfe3b7a ("mm: mempolicy: make mbind() return
    -EIO when MPOL_MF_STRICT is specified") and early break on the first pte
    in the range results in pte_unmap_unlock on an underflow pte.  This can
    lead to lockups later on when somebody tries to lock the pte resp.
    page_table_lock again..

    ring-buffer: Fix recursion protection transitions between interrupt context
    
    [ Upstream commit b02414c8f045ab3b9afc816c3735bc98c5c3d262 ]
    
    The recursion protection of the ring buffer depends on preempt_count() to be
    correct. But it is possible that the ring buffer gets called after an
    interrupt comes in but before it updates the preempt_count(). This will
    trigger a false positive in the recursion code.
    
    Use the same trick from the ftrace function callback recursion code which
    uses a "transition" bit that gets set, to allow for a single recursion for
    to handle transitions between contexts.

    regulator: defer probe when trying to get voltage from unresolved supply
    
    [ Upstream commit cf1ad559a20d1930aa7b47a52f54e1f8718de301 ]
    
    regulator_get_voltage_rdev() is called in regulator probe() when
    applying machine constraints.  The "fixed" commit exposed the problem
    that non-bypassed regulators can forward the request to its parent
    (like bypassed ones) supply. Return -EPROBE_DEFER when the supply
    is expected but not resolved yet.
