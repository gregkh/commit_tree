    mm/kmemleak.c: fix unused-function warning
    
    commit dce5b0bdeec61bdbee56121ceb1d014151d5cab1 upstream.
    
    The only references outside of the #ifdef have been removed, so now we
    get a warning in non-SMP configurations:
    
      mm/kmemleak.c:1404:13: error: unused function 'scan_large_block' [-Werror,-Wunused-function]
    
    Add a new #ifdef around it.

    media: v4l2: i2c: ov7670: Fix PLL bypass register values
    
    commit 61da76beef1e4f0b6ba7be4f8d0cf0dac7ce1f55 upstream.
    
    The following commits:
    commit f6dd927f34d6 ("[media] media: ov7670: calculate framerate properly for ov7675")
    commit 04ee6d92047e ("[media] media: ov7670: add possibility to bypass pll for ov7675")
    introduced the ability to bypass PLL multiplier and use input clock (xvclk)
    as pixel clock output frequency for ov7675 sensor.
    
    PLL is bypassed using register DBLV[7:6], according to ov7670 and ov7675
    sensor manuals. Macros used to set DBLV register seem wrong in the
    driver, as their values do not match what reported in the datasheet.
    
    Fix by changing DBLV_* macros to use bits [7:6] and set bits [3:0] to
    default 0x0a reserved value (according to datasheets).
    
    While at there, remove a write to DBLV register in
    "ov7675_set_framerate()" that over-writes the previous one to the same
    register that takes "info->pll_bypass" flag into account instead of setting PLL
    multiplier to 4x unconditionally.
    
    And, while at there, since "info->pll_bypass" is only used in
    set/get_framerate() functions used by ov7675 only, it is not necessary
    to check for the device id at probe time to make sure that when using
    ov7670 "info->pll_bypass" is set to false.

    commit 780e0106d468a2962b16b52fdf42898f2639e0a0 upstream.
    
    Revert the following commit:
    
      515ab7c41306: ("x86/mm: Align TLB invalidation info")
    
    I found out (the hard way) that under some .config options (notably L1_CACHE_SHIFT=7)
    and compiler combinations this on-stack alignment leads to a 320 byte
    stack usage, which then triggers a KASAN stack warning elsewhere.
    
    Using 320 bytes of stack space for a 40 byte structure is ludicrous and
    clearly not right.

    x86/mm: Fix a crash with kmemleak_scan()
    
    commit 0d02113b31b2017dd349ec9df2314e798a90fa6e upstream.
    
    The first kmemleak_scan() call after boot would trigger the crash below
    because this callpath:
    
      kernel_init
        free_initmem
          mem_encrypt_free_decrypted_mem
            free_init_pages
    
    unmaps memory inside the .bss when DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y.
    
    kmemleak_init() will register the .data/.bss sections and then
    kmemleak_scan() will scan those addresses and dereference them looking
    for pointer references. If free_init_pages() frees and unmaps pages in
    those sections, kmemleak_scan() will crash if referencing one of those
    addresses:
    
      BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffffffbd402000
      CPU: 12 PID: 325 Comm: kmemleak Not tainted 5.1.0-rc4+ #4
      RIP: 0010:scan_block
      Call Trace:
       scan_gray_list
       kmemleak_scan
       kmemleak_scan_thread
       kthread
       ret_from_fork
    
    Since kmemleak_free_part() is tolerant to unknown objects (not tracked
    by kmemleak), it is fine to call it from free_init_pages() even if not
    all address ranges passed to this function are known to kmemleak.

    x86/mm/KASLR: Fix the size of the direct mapping section
    
    commit ec3937107ab43f3e8b2bc9dad95710043c462ff7 upstream.
    
    kernel_randomize_memory() uses __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT to calculate
    the maximum amount of system RAM supported. The size of the direct
    mapping section is obtained from the smaller one of the below two
    values:
    
      (actual system RAM size + padding size) vs (max system RAM size supported)
    
    This calculation is wrong since commit
    
      b83ce5ee9147 ("x86/mm/64: Make __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT always 52").
    
    In it, __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT was changed to be 52, regardless of whether
    the kernel is using 4-level or 5-level page tables. Thus, it will always
    use 4 PB as the maximum amount of system RAM, even in 4-level paging
    mode where it should actually be 64 TB.
    
    Thus, the size of the direct mapping section will always
    be the sum of the actual system RAM size plus the padding size.
    
    Even when the amount of system RAM is 64 TB, the following layout will
    still be used. Obviously KALSR will be weakened significantly.
    
       |____|_______actual RAM_______|_padding_|______the rest_______|
       0            64TB                                            ~120TB
    
    Instead, it should be like this:
    
       |____|_______actual RAM_______|_________the rest______________|
       0            64TB                                            ~120TB
    
    The size of padding region is controlled by
    CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY_PHYSICAL_PADDING, which is 10 TB by default.
    
    The above issue only exists when
    CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY_PHYSICAL_PADDING is set to a non-zero value,
    which is the case when CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG is enabled. Otherwise,
    using __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT doesn't affect KASLR.
    
    Fix it by replacing __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT with MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS.

    Since commit 648e921888ad ("clk: x86: Stop marking clocks as
    CLK_IS_CRITICAL"), the pmc_plt_clocks of the Bay Trail SoC are
    unconditionally gated off. Unfortunately this will break systems where these
    clocks are used for external purposes beyond the kernel's knowledge. Fix it
    by implementing a system specific quirk to mark the necessary pmc_plt_clks as
    critical.

    mac80211: Honor SW_CRYPTO_CONTROL for unicast keys in AP VLAN mode
    
    commit 78ad2341521d5ea96cb936244ed4c4c4ef9ec13b upstream.
    
    Restore SW_CRYPTO_CONTROL operation on AP_VLAN interfaces for unicast
    keys, the original override was intended to be done for group keys as
    those are treated specially by mac80211 and would always have been
    rejected.
    
    Now the situation is that AP_VLAN support must be enabled by the driver
    if it can support it (meaning it can support software crypto GTK TX).
    
    Thus, also simplify the code - if we get here with AP_VLAN and non-
    pairwise key, software crypto must be used (driver doesn't know about
    the interface) and can be used (driver must've advertised AP_VLAN if
    it also uses SW_CRYPTO_CONTROL).

    commit a83d6ddaebe541570291205cb538e35ad4ff94f9 upstream.
    
    In the SECURITY_FS_USE_MNTPOINT case we never want to allow relabeling
    files/directories, so we should never set the SBLABEL_MNT flag. The
    'special handling' in selinux_is_sblabel_mnt() is only intended for when
    the behavior is set to SECURITY_FS_USE_GENFS.
    
    While there, make the logic in selinux_is_sblabel_mnt() more explicit
    and add a BUILD_BUG_ON() to make sure that introducing a new
    SECURITY_FS_USE_* forces a review of the logic.

    results in no audit messages at all if in permissive mode because the

    the subsequent ref walk.  Fix this by not updating the cache when
    performing a non-blocking permission check.  This only affects search

    commit 937c4e552fd1174784045684740edfcea536159d upstream.
    
    We need to turn regulators on and off when switching brightness, and
    that may block, therefore we have to set stmfts_brightness_set() as
    LED's brightness_set_blocking() method.

    Input: snvs_pwrkey - initialize necessary driver data before enabling IRQ
    
    commit bf2a7ca39fd3ab47ef71c621a7ee69d1813b1f97 upstream.
    
    SNVS IRQ is requested before necessary driver data initialized,
    if there is a pending IRQ during driver probe phase, kernel
    NULL pointer panic will occur in IRQ handler. To avoid such
    scenario, just initialize necessary driver data before enabling
    IRQ. This patch is inspired by NXP's internal kernel tree.

    commit 639e5eb3c7d67e407f2a71fccd95323751398f6f upstream.
    
    Previously support was added to allow streams to be stopped and
    started again without the DSP being power cycled and this was done
    by clearing the buffer state in trigger start. Another supported
    use-case is using the DSP for a trigger event then opening the
    compressed stream later to receive the audio, unfortunately clearing
    the buffer state in trigger start destroys the data received
    from such a trigger. Correct this issue by moving the call to
    wm_adsp_buffer_clear to be in trigger stop instead.

    Commit 37c7401e8c1f ("ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Fix DMIC map

    this was based on the observation that all bytcr_rt5651 devices I have
    access to (7 devices) where all using IN3P for the headsetmic. This was
    an attempt to unifify / simplify the mapping, but it was wrong.
    
    None of those devices was actually using a digital internal mic. Now I've
    access to a Point of View TAB-P1006W-232 (v1.0) tabler, which does use a
    DMIC and it does have its headsetmic connected to IN2P, showing that the
    original mapping was correct, so this commit reverts the change changing
    the mapping back to IN2P.

    perf/x86/amd: Update generic hardware cache events for Family 17h
    
    commit 0e3b74e26280f2cf8753717a950b97d424da6046 upstream.
    
    Add a new amd_hw_cache_event_ids_f17h assignment structure set
    for AMD families 17h and above, since a lot has changed.  Specifically:
    
    L1 Data Cache
    
    The data cache access counter remains the same on Family 17h.
    
    For DC misses, PMCx041's definition changes with Family 17h,
    so instead we use the L2 cache accesses from L1 data cache
    misses counter (PMCx060,umask=0xc8).
    
    For DC hardware prefetch events, Family 17h breaks compatibility
    for PMCx067 "Data Prefetcher", so instead, we use PMCx05a "Hardware
    Prefetch DC Fills."
    
    L1 Instruction Cache
    
    PMCs 0x80 and 0x81 (32-byte IC fetches and misses) are backward
    compatible on Family 17h.
    
    For prefetches, we remove the erroneous PMCx04B assignment which
    counts how many software data cache prefetch load instructions were
    dispatched.
    
    LL - Last Level Cache
    
    Removing PMCs 7D, 7E, and 7F assignments, as they do not exist
    on Family 17h, where the last level cache is L3.  L3 counters
    can be accessed using the existing AMD Uncore driver.
    
    Data TLB
    
    On Intel machines, data TLB accesses ("dTLB-loads") are assigned
    to counters that count load/store instructions retired.  This
    is inconsistent with instruction TLB accesses, where Intel
    implementations report iTLB misses that hit in the STLB.
    
    Ideally, dTLB-loads would count higher level dTLB misses that hit
    in lower level TLBs, and dTLB-load-misses would report those
    that also missed in those lower-level TLBs, therefore causing
    a page table walk.  That would be consistent with instruction
    TLB operation, remove the redundancy between dTLB-loads and
    L1-dcache-loads, and prevent perf from producing artificially
    low percentage ratios, i.e. the "0.01%" below:
    
            42,550,869      L1-dcache-loads
            41,591,860      dTLB-loads
                 4,802      dTLB-load-misses          #    0.01% of all dTLB cache hits
             7,283,682      L1-dcache-stores
             7,912,392      dTLB-stores
                   310      dTLB-store-misses
    
    On AMD Families prior to 17h, the "Data Cache Accesses" counter is
    used, which is slightly better than load/store instructions retired,
    but still counts in terms of individual load/store operations
    instead of TLB operations.
    
    So, for AMD Families 17h and higher, this patch assigns "dTLB-loads"
    to a counter for L1 dTLB misses that hit in the L2 dTLB, and
    "dTLB-load-misses" to a counter for L1 DTLB misses that caused
    L2 DTLB misses and therefore also caused page table walks.  This
    results in a much more accurate view of data TLB performance:
    
            60,961,781      L1-dcache-loads
                 4,601      dTLB-loads
                   963      dTLB-load-misses          #   20.93% of all dTLB cache hits
    
    Note that for all AMD families, data loads and stores are combined
    in a single accesses counter, so no 'L1-dcache-stores' are reported
    separately, and stores are counted with loads in 'L1-dcache-loads'.
    
    Also note that the "% of all dTLB cache hits" string is misleading
    because (a) "dTLB cache": although TLBs can be considered caches for
    page tables, in this context, it can be misinterpreted as data cache
    hits because the figures are similar (at least on Intel), and (b) not
    all those loads (technically accesses) technically "hit" at that
    hardware level.  "% of all dTLB accesses" would be more clear/accurate.
    
    Instruction TLB
    
    On Intel machines, 'iTLB-loads' measure iTLB misses that hit in the
    STLB, and 'iTLB-load-misses' measure iTLB misses that also missed in
    the STLB and completed a page table walk.
    
    For AMD Family 17h and above, for 'iTLB-loads' we replace the
    erroneous instruction cache fetches counter with PMCx084
    "L1 ITLB Miss, L2 ITLB Hit".
    
    For 'iTLB-load-misses' we still use PMCx085 "L1 ITLB Miss,
    L2 ITLB Miss", but set a 0xff umask because without it the event
    does not get counted.
    
    Branch Predictor (BPU)
    
    PMCs 0xc2 and 0xc3 continue to be valid across all AMD Families.
    
    Node Level Events
    
    Family 17h does not have a PMCx0e9 counter, and corresponding counters
    have not been made available publicly, so for now, we mark them as
    unsupported for Families 17h and above.

    [ Upstream commit 2e3c18d0ada16f145087b2687afcad1748c0827c ]
    
    syzbot is hitting flush_work() warning caused by commit 4d43d395fed12463
    ("workqueue: Try to catch flush_work() without INIT_WORK().") [1].
    Although that commit did not expect INIT_WORK(NULL) case, calling
    flush_work() without setting a valid callback should be avoided anyway.
    Fix this problem by setting a no-op callback instead of NULL.

    fs: stream_open - opener for stream-like files so that read and write can run simultaneously without deadlock
    
    [ Upstream commit 10dce8af34226d90fa56746a934f8da5dcdba3df ]
    
    Commit 9c225f2655e3 ("vfs: atomic f_pos accesses as per POSIX") added
    locking for file.f_pos access and in particular made concurrent read and
    write not possible - now both those functions take f_pos lock for the
    whole run, and so if e.g. a read is blocked waiting for data, write will
    deadlock waiting for that read to complete.
    
    This caused regression for stream-like files where previously read and
    write could run simultaneously, but after that patch could not do so
    anymore. See e.g. commit 581d21a2d02a ("xenbus: fix deadlock on writes
    to /proc/xen/xenbus") which fixes such regression for particular case of
    /proc/xen/xenbus.
    
    The patch that added f_pos lock in 2014 did so to guarantee POSIX thread
    safety for read/write/lseek and added the locking to file descriptors of
    all regular files. In 2014 that thread-safety problem was not new as it
    was already discussed earlier in 2006.
    
    However even though 2006'th version of Linus's patch was adding f_pos
    locking "only for files that are marked seekable with FMODE_LSEEK (thus
    avoiding the stream-like objects like pipes and sockets)", the 2014
    version - the one that actually made it into the tree as 9c225f2655e3 -
    is doing so irregardless of whether a file is seekable or not.
    
    See
    
        https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/53022DB1.4070805@gmail.com/
        https://lwn.net/Articles/180387
        https://lwn.net/Articles/180396
    
    for historic context.
    
    The reason that it did so is, probably, that there are many files that
    are marked non-seekable, but e.g. their read implementation actually
    depends on knowing current position to correctly handle the read. Some
    examples:
    
            kernel/power/user.c             snapshot_read
            fs/debugfs/file.c               u32_array_read
            fs/fuse/control.c               fuse_conn_waiting_read + ...
            drivers/hwmon/asus_atk0110.c    atk_debugfs_ggrp_read
            arch/s390/hypfs/inode.c         hypfs_read_iter
            ...
    
    Despite that, many nonseekable_open users implement read and write with
    pure stream semantics - they don't depend on passed ppos at all. And for
    those cases where read could wait for something inside, it creates a
    situation similar to xenbus - the write could be never made to go until
    read is done, and read is waiting for some, potentially external, event,
    for potentially unbounded time -> deadlock.
    
    Besides xenbus, there are 14 such places in the kernel that I've found
    with semantic patch (see below):
    
            drivers/xen/evtchn.c:667:8-24: ERROR: evtchn_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/isdn/capi/capi.c:963:8-24: ERROR: capi_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/input/evdev.c:527:1-17: ERROR: evdev_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/char/pcmcia/cm4000_cs.c:1685:7-23: ERROR: cm4000_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            net/rfkill/core.c:1146:8-24: ERROR: rfkill_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/s390/char/fs3270.c:488:1-17: ERROR: fs3270_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/usb/misc/ldusb.c:310:1-17: ERROR: ld_usb_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/hid/uhid.c:635:1-17: ERROR: uhid_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            net/batman-adv/icmp_socket.c:80:1-17: ERROR: batadv_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/media/rc/lirc_dev.c:198:1-17: ERROR: lirc_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/leds/uleds.c:77:1-17: ERROR: uleds_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/input/misc/uinput.c:400:1-17: ERROR: uinput_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/infiniband/core/user_mad.c:985:7-23: ERROR: umad_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/gnss/core.c:45:1-17: ERROR: gnss_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
    
    In addition to the cases above another regression caused by f_pos
    locking is that now FUSE filesystems that implement open with
    FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE flag, can no longer implement bidirectional
    stream-like files - for the same reason as above e.g. read can deadlock
    write locking on file.f_pos in the kernel.
    
    FUSE's FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE was added in 2008 in a7c1b990f715 ("fuse:
    implement nonseekable open") to support OSSPD. OSSPD implements /dev/dsp
    in userspace with FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE flag, with corresponding read and
    write routines not depending on current position at all, and with both
    read and write being potentially blocking operations:
    
    See
    
        https://github.com/libfuse/osspd
        https://lwn.net/Articles/308445
    
        https://github.com/libfuse/osspd/blob/14a9cff0/osspd.c#L1406
        https://github.com/libfuse/osspd/blob/14a9cff0/osspd.c#L1438-L1477
        https://github.com/libfuse/osspd/blob/14a9cff0/osspd.c#L1479-L1510
    
    Corresponding libfuse example/test also describes FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE as
    "somewhat pipe-like files ..." with read handler not using offset.
    However that test implements only read without write and cannot exercise
    the deadlock scenario:
    
        https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/fuse-3.4.2-3-ga1bff7d/example/poll.c#L124-L131
        https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/fuse-3.4.2-3-ga1bff7d/example/poll.c#L146-L163
        https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/fuse-3.4.2-3-ga1bff7d/example/poll.c#L209-L216
    
    I've actually hit the read vs write deadlock for real while implementing
    my FUSE filesystem where there is /head/watch file, for which open
    creates separate bidirectional socket-like stream in between filesystem
    and its user with both read and write being later performed
    simultaneously. And there it is semantically not easy to split the
    stream into two separate read-only and write-only channels:
    
        https://lab.nexedi.com/kirr/wendelin.core/blob/f13aa600/wcfs/wcfs.go#L88-169
    
    Let's fix this regression. The plan is:
    
    1. We can't change nonseekable_open to include &~FMODE_ATOMIC_POS -
       doing so would break many in-kernel nonseekable_open users which
       actually use ppos in read/write handlers.
    
    2. Add stream_open() to kernel to open stream-like non-seekable file
       descriptors. Read and write on such file descriptors would never use
       nor change ppos. And with that property on stream-like files read and
       write will be running without taking f_pos lock - i.e. read and write
       could be running simultaneously.
    
    3. With semantic patch search and convert to stream_open all in-kernel
       nonseekable_open users for which read and write actually do not
       depend on ppos and where there is no other methods in file_operations
       which assume @offset access.
    
    4. Add FOPEN_STREAM to fs/fuse/ and open in-kernel file-descriptors via
       steam_open if that bit is present in filesystem open reply.
    
       It was tempting to change fs/fuse/ open handler to use stream_open
       instead of nonseekable_open on just FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE flags, but
       grepping through Debian codesearch shows users of FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE,
       and in particular GVFS which actually uses offset in its read and
       write handlers
    
            https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=-%3Enonseekable+%3D
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1080
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1247-1346
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1399-1481
    
       so if we would do such a change it will break a real user.
    
    5. Add stream_open and FOPEN_STREAM handling to stable kernels starting
       from v3.14+ (the kernel where 9c225f2655 first appeared).
    
       This will allow to patch OSSPD and other FUSE filesystems that
       provide stream-like files to return FOPEN_STREAM | FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE
       in their open handler and this way avoid the deadlock on all kernel
       versions. This should work because fs/fuse/ ignores unknown open
       flags returned from a filesystem and so passing FOPEN_STREAM to a
       kernel that is not aware of this flag cannot hurt. In turn the kernel
       that is not aware of FOPEN_STREAM will be < v3.14 where just
       FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE is sufficient to implement streams without read vs
       write deadlock.
    
    This patch adds stream_open, converts /proc/xen/xenbus to it and adds
    semantic patch to automatically locate in-kernel places that are either
    required to be converted due to read vs write deadlock, or that are just
    safe to be converted because read and write do not use ppos and there
    are no other funky methods in file_operations.
    
    Regarding semantic patch I've verified each generated change manually -
    that it is correct to convert - and each other nonseekable_open instance
    left - that it is either not correct to convert there, or that it is not
    converted due to current stream_open.cocci limitations.
    
    The script also does not convert files that should be valid to convert,
    but that currently have .llseek = noop_llseek or generic_file_llseek for
    unknown reason despite file being opened with nonseekable_open (e.g.
    drivers/input/mousedev.c)

    xsysace: Fix error handling in ace_setup
    
    [ Upstream commit 47b16820c490149c2923e8474048f2c6e7557cab ]
    
    If xace hardware reports a bad version number, the error handling code
    in ace_setup() calls put_disk(), followed by queue cleanup. However, since
    the disk data structure has the queue pointer set, put_disk() also
    cleans and releases the queue. This results in blk_cleanup_queue()
    accessing an already released data structure, which in turn may result
    in a crash such as the following.

    Fix the problem by setting the disk queue pointer to NULL before calling
    put_disk(). A more comprehensive fix might be to rearrange the code
    to check the hardware version before initializing data structures,
    but I don't know if this would have undesirable side effects, and
    it would increase the complexity of backporting the fix to older kernels.

    sh: fix multiple function definition build errors
    
    [ Upstream commit acaf892ecbf5be7710ae05a61fd43c668f68ad95 ]
    
    Many of the sh CPU-types have their own plat_irq_setup() and
    arch_init_clk_ops() functions, so these same (empty) functions in
    arch/sh/boards/of-generic.c are not needed and cause build errors.
    
    If there is some case where these empty functions are needed, they can
    be retained by marking them as "__weak" while at the same time making
    builds that do not need them succeed.
    
    Fixes these build errors:
    
    arch/sh/boards/of-generic.o: In function `plat_irq_setup':
    (.init.text+0x134): multiple definition of `plat_irq_setup'
    arch/sh/kernel/cpu/sh2/setup-sh7619.o:(.init.text+0x30): first defined here

    hugetlbfs: fix memory leak for resv_map
    
    [ Upstream commit 58b6e5e8f1addd44583d61b0a03c0f5519527e35 ]
    
    When mknod is used to create a block special file in hugetlbfs, it will
    allocate an inode and kmalloc a 'struct resv_map' via resv_map_alloc().
    inode->i_mapping->private_data will point the newly allocated resv_map.
    However, when the device special file is opened bd_acquire() will set
    inode->i_mapping to bd_inode->i_mapping.  Thus the pointer to the
    allocated resv_map is lost and the structure is leaked.
    
    Programs to reproduce:
            mount -t hugetlbfs nodev hugetlbfs
            mknod hugetlbfs/dev b 0 0
            exec 30<> hugetlbfs/dev
            umount hugetlbfs/
    
    resv_map structures are only needed for inodes which can have associated
    page allocations.  To fix the leak, only allocate resv_map for those
    inodes which could possibly be associated with page allocations.

    kmemleak: powerpc: skip scanning holes in the .bss section
    
    [ Upstream commit 298a32b132087550d3fa80641ca58323c5dfd4d9 ]
    
    Commit 2d4f567103ff ("KVM: PPC: Introduce kvm_tmp framework") adds
    kvm_tmp[] into the .bss section and then free the rest of unused spaces
    back to the page allocator.
    
    kernel_init
      kvm_guest_init
        kvm_free_tmp
          free_reserved_area
            free_unref_page
              free_unref_page_prepare
    
    With DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y, it will unmap those pages from kernel.  As the
    result, kmemleak scan will trigger a panic when it scans the .bss
    section with unmapped pages.
    
    This patch creates dedicated kmemleak objects for the .data, .bss and
    potentially .data..ro_after_init sections to allow partial freeing via
    the kmemleak_free_part() in the powerpc kvm_free_tmp() function.

    have a unmap operation for tx ring buffer, which is already unmapped
    when xmit done, than cause this WARNING.
    
    The hnae_alloc_buffers() is called in hnae_init_ring(),

    When the ring buffer is tx ring, adds a piece of code to ensure that
    the tx ring is unmap.

    net: hns: Use NAPI_POLL_WEIGHT for hns driver
    
    [ Upstream commit acb1ce15a61154aa501891d67ebf79bc9ea26818 ]
    
    When the HNS driver loaded, always have an error print:
    "netif_napi_add() called with weight 256"
    
    This is because the kernel checks the NAPI polling weights
    requested by drivers and it prints an error message if a driver
    requests a weight bigger than 64.
    
    So use NAPI_POLL_WEIGHT to fix it.

    [ Upstream commit 3a39a12ad364a9acd1038ba8da67cd8430f30de4 ]
    
    This patch is trying to fix the issue due to:
    [27237.844750] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in hns_nic_net_xmit_hw+0x708/0xa18[hns_enet_drv]
    
    After hnae_queue_xmit() in hns_nic_net_xmit_hw(), can be
    interrupted by interruptions, and than call hns_nic_tx_poll_one()
    to handle the new packets, and free the skb. So, when turn back to
    hns_nic_net_xmit_hw(), calling skb->len will cause use-after-free.
    
    This patch update tx ring statistics in hns_nic_tx_poll_one() to
    fix the bug.

    scsi: storvsc: Fix calculation of sub-channel count
    
    [ Upstream commit 382e06d11e075a40b4094b6ef809f8d4bcc7ab2a ]
    
    When the number of sub-channels offered by Hyper-V is >= the number of CPUs
    in the VM, calculate the correct number of sub-channels.  The current code
    produces one too many.
    
    This scenario arises only when the number of CPUs is artificially
    restricted (for example, with maxcpus=<n> on the kernel boot line), because
    Hyper-V normally offers a sub-channel count < number of CPUs.  While the
    current code doesn't break, the extra sub-channel is unbalanced across the
    CPUs (for example, a total of 5 channels on a VM with 4 CPUs).

    mfd: twl-core: Disable IRQ while suspended

    on gta04 we have handle_twl4030_pih() called in situations where pm_runtime_get()
    in i2c-omap.c returns -EACCES.

    This happens when we wakeup via something behing twl4030 (powerbutton or rtc

    Disable the irq on suspend and enable it on resume to avoid
    having i2c access problems when the irq registers are checked.

    [ Upstream commit 93b919da64c15b90953f96a536e5e61df896ca57 ]
    
    symlink body shouldn't be freed without an RCU delay.  Switch debugfs to
    ->destroy_inode() and use of call_rcu(); free both the inode and symlink
    body in the callback.  Similar to solution for bpf, only here it's even
    more obvious that ->evict_inode() can be dropped.

    net: stmmac: fix dropping of multi-descriptor RX frames
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ac0c24fe1c256af6644caf3d311029440ec2fbd ]
    
    Packets without the last descriptor set should be dropped early. If we
    receive a frame larger than the DMA buffer, the HW will continue using the
    next descriptor. Driver mistakes these as individual frames, and sometimes
    a truncated frame (without the LD set) may look like a valid packet.
    
    This fixes a strange issue where the system replies to 4098-byte ping
    although the MTU/DMA buffer size is set to 4096, and yet at the same
    time it's logging an oversized packet.

    [ Upstream commit 07b3975352374c3f5ebb4a42ef0b253fe370542d ]
    
    Currently, if we drop a packet, we exit from NAPI loop before the budget
    is consumed. In some situations this will make the RX processing stall
    e.g. when flood pinging the system with oversized packets, as the
    errorneous packets are not dropped efficiently.
    
    If we drop a packet, we should just continue to the next one as long as
    the budget allows.

    [ Upstream commit eca4a928585ac08147e5cc8e2111ecbc6279ee31 ]
    
    Traditionally, the PF (Physical Function) which resides on vport 0 was
    the E-switch manager. Since the ECPF (Embedded CPU Physical Function),
    which resides on vport 0xfffe, was introduced as the E-Switch manager,
    the assumption that the E-switch manager is on vport 0 is incorrect.
    
    Since the eswitch code already uses the actual vport value, all we
    need is to always set other_vport=1.

    igb: Fix WARN_ONCE on runtime suspend
    
    [ Upstream commit dabb8338be533c18f50255cf39ff4f66d4dabdbe ]
    
    The runtime_suspend device callbacks are not supposed to save
    configuration state or change the power state. Commit fb29f76cc566
    ("igb: Fix an issue that PME is not enabled during runtime suspend")
    changed the driver to not save configuration state during runtime
    suspend, however the driver callback still put the device into a
    low-power state. This causes a warning in the pci pm core and results in
    pci_pm_runtime_suspend not calling pci_save_state or pci_finish_runtime_suspend.
    
    Fix this by not changing the power state either, leaving that to pci pm
    core, and make the same change for suspend callback as well.
    
    Also move a couple of defines into the appropriate header file instead
    of inline in the .c file.

    The batadv_hash_remove is a function which searches the hashtable for an

    function matches it with the needle. It returns the pointer to the
    hlist_node which matches or NULL when no entry matches the needle.
    
    The batadv_tt_global_free is not itself protected in anyway to avoid that
    any other function is modifying the hashtable between the search for the
    entry and the call to batadv_hash_remove. It can therefore happen that the
    entry either doesn't exist anymore or an entry was deleted which is not the
    same object as the needle. In such an situation, the reference counter (for
    the reference stored in the hashtable) must not be reduced for the needle.
    Instead the reference counter of the actually removed entry has to be
    reduced.
    
    Otherwise the reference counter will underflow and the object might be
    freed before all its references were dropped. The kref helpers reported
    this problem as:

    sh_rtc_read_alarm_value() returns 0xff when querying a hardware alarm
    field that is not enabled.  __rtc_read_alarm() validates the received
    alarm values, and fills in missing fields when needed.
    While 0xff is handled fine for the year, month, and day fields, and
    corrected as considered being out-of-range, this is not the case for the
    hour, minute, and second fields, where -1 is expected for missing
    fields.
    
    Fix this by returning -1 instead, as this value is handled fine for all
    fields.

    rtc: cros-ec: Fail suspend/resume if wake IRQ can't be configured
    
    [ Upstream commit d6752e185c3168771787a02dc6a55f32260943cc ]
    
    If we encounter a failure during suspend where this RTC was programmed
    to wakeup the system from suspend, but that wakeup couldn't be
    configured because the system didn't support wakeup interrupts, we'll
    run into the following warning:
    
            Unbalanced IRQ 166 wake disable
            WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 3071 at kernel/irq/manage.c:669 irq_set_irq_wake+0x108/0x278
    
    This happens because the suspend process isn't aborted when the RTC
    fails to configure the wakeup IRQ. Instead, we continue suspending the
    system and then another suspend callback fails the suspend process and
    "unwinds" the previously suspended drivers by calling their resume
    callbacks. When we get back to resuming this RTC driver, we'll call
    disable_irq_wake() on an IRQ that hasn't been configured for wake.
    
    Let's just fail suspend/resume here if we can't configure the system to
    wake and the user has chosen to wakeup with this device. This fixes this
    warning and makes the code more robust in case there are systems out
    there that can't wakeup from suspend on this line but the user has
    chosen to do so.

    USB: core: Fix bug caused by duplicate interface PM usage counter
    
    commit c2b71462d294cf517a0bc6e4fd6424d7cee5596f upstream.
    
    The syzkaller fuzzer reported a bug in the USB hub driver which turned
    out to be caused by a negative runtime-PM usage counter.  This allowed
    a hub to be runtime suspended at a time when the driver did not expect
    it.  The symptom is a WARNING issued because the hub's status URB is
    submitted while it is already active:
    
            URB 0000000031fb463e submitted while active
            WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2917 at drivers/usb/core/urb.c:363
    
    The negative runtime-PM usage count was caused by an unfortunate
    design decision made when runtime PM was first implemented for USB.
    At that time, USB class drivers were allowed to unbind from their
    interfaces without balancing the usage counter (i.e., leaving it with
    a positive count).  The core code would take care of setting the
    counter back to 0 before allowing another driver to bind to the
    interface.
    
    Later on when runtime PM was implemented for the entire kernel, the
    opposite decision was made: Drivers were required to balance their
    runtime-PM get and put calls.  In order to maintain backward
    compatibility, however, the USB subsystem adapted to the new
    implementation by keeping an independent usage counter for each
    interface and using it to automatically adjust the normal usage
    counter back to 0 whenever a driver was unbound.
    
    This approach involves duplicating information, but what is worse, it
    doesn't work properly in cases where a USB class driver delays
    decrementing the usage counter until after the driver's disconnect()
    routine has returned and the counter has been adjusted back to 0.
    Doing so would cause the usage counter to become negative.  There's
    even a warning about this in the USB power management documentation!
    
    As it happens, this is exactly what the hub driver does.  The
    kick_hub_wq() routine increments the runtime-PM usage counter, and the
    corresponding decrement is carried out by hub_event() in the context
    of the hub_wq work-queue thread.  This work routine may sometimes run
    after the driver has been unbound from its interface, and when it does
    it causes the usage counter to go negative.
    
    It is not possible for hub_disconnect() to wait for a pending
    hub_event() call to finish, because hub_disconnect() is called with
    the device lock held and hub_event() acquires that lock.  The only
    feasible fix is to reverse the original design decision: remove the
    duplicate interface-specific usage counter and require USB drivers to
    balance their runtime PM gets and puts.  As far as I know, all
    existing drivers currently do this.

    USB: core: Fix unterminated string returned by usb_string()
    
    commit c01c348ecdc66085e44912c97368809612231520 upstream.
    
    Some drivers (such as the vub300 MMC driver) expect usb_string() to
    return a properly NUL-terminated string, even when an error occurs.
    (In fact, vub300's probe routine doesn't bother to check the return
    code from usb_string().)  When the driver goes on to use an
    unterminated string, it leads to kernel errors such as
    stack-out-of-bounds, as found by the syzkaller USB fuzzer.
    
    An out-of-range string index argument is not at all unlikely, given
    that some devices don't provide string descriptors and therefore list
    0 as the value for their string indexes.  This patch makes
    usb_string() return a properly terminated empty string along with the
    -EINVAL error code when an out-of-range index is encountered.
    
    And since a USB string index is a single-byte value, indexes >= 256
    are just as invalid as values of 0 or below.

    usb: usbip: fix isoc packet num validation in get_pipe
    
    commit c409ca3be3c6ff3a1eeb303b191184e80d412862 upstream.
    
    Change the validation of number_of_packets in get_pipe to compare the
    number of packets to a fixed maximum number of packets allowed, set to
    be 1024. This number was chosen due to it being used by other drivers as
    well, for example drivers/usb/host/uhci-q.c
    
    Background/reason:
    The get_pipe function in stub_rx.c validates the number of packets in
    isochronous mode and aborts with an error if that number is too large,
    in order to prevent malicious input from possibly triggering large
    memory allocations. This was previously done by checking whether
    pdu->u.cmd_submit.number_of_packets is bigger than the number of packets
    that would be needed for pdu->u.cmd_submit.transfer_buffer_length bytes
    if all except possibly the last packet had maximum length, given by
    usb_endpoint_maxp(epd) *  usb_endpoint_maxp_mult(epd). This leads to an
    error if URBs with packets shorter than the maximum possible length are
    submitted, which is allowed according to
    Documentation/driver-api/usb/URB.rst and occurs for example with the
    snd-usb-audio driver.

    USB: dummy-hcd: Fix failure to give back unlinked URBs
    
    commit fc834e607ae3d18e1a20bca3f9a2d7f52ea7a2be upstream.
    
    The syzkaller USB fuzzer identified a failure mode in which dummy-hcd
    would never give back an unlinked URB.  This causes usb_kill_urb() to
    hang, leading to WARNINGs and unkillable threads.
    
    In dummy-hcd, all URBs are given back by the dummy_timer() routine as
    it scans through the list of pending URBS.  Failure to give back URBs
    can be caused by failure to start or early exit from the scanning
    loop.  The code currently has two such pathways: One is triggered when
    an unsupported bus transfer speed is encountered, and the other by
    exhausting the simulated bandwidth for USB transfers during a frame.
    
    This patch removes those two paths, thereby allowing all unlinked URBs
    to be given back in a timely manner.  It adds a check for the bus
    speed when the gadget first starts running, so that dummy_timer() will
    never thereafter encounter an unsupported speed.  And it prevents the
    loop from exiting as soon as the total bandwidth has been used up (the
    scanning loop continues, giving back unlinked URBs as they are found,
    but not transferring any more data).
    
    Thanks to Andrey Konovalov for manually running the syzkaller fuzzer
    to help track down the source of the bug.

    USB: w1 ds2490: Fix bug caused by improper use of altsetting array
    
    commit c114944d7d67f24e71562fcfc18d550ab787e4d4 upstream.
    
    The syzkaller USB fuzzer spotted a slab-out-of-bounds bug in the
    ds2490 driver.  This bug is caused by improper use of the altsetting
    array in the usb_interface structure (the array's entries are not
    always stored in numerical order), combined with a naive assumption
    that all interfaces probed by the driver will have the expected number
    of altsettings.
    
    The bug can be fixed by replacing references to the possibly
    non-existent intf->altsetting[alt] entry with the guaranteed-to-exist
    intf->cur_altsetting entry.

    USB: yurex: Fix protection fault after device removal
    
    commit ef61eb43ada6c1d6b94668f0f514e4c268093ff3 upstream.
    
    The syzkaller USB fuzzer found a general-protection-fault bug in the
    yurex driver.  The fault occurs when a device has been unplugged; the
    driver's interrupt-URB handler logs an error message referring to the
    device by name, after the device has been unregistered and its name
    deallocated.
    
    This problem is caused by the fact that the interrupt URB isn't
    cancelled until the driver's private data structure is released, which
    can happen long after the device is gone.  The cure is to make sure
    that the interrupt URB is killed before yurex_disconnect() returns;
    this is exactly the sort of thing that usb_poison_urb() was meant for.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Apply the fixup for ASUS Q325UAR
    
    commit 3887c26c0e24d50a4d0ce20cf4726737cee1a2fd upstream.
    
    Some ASUS models like Q325UAR with ALC295 codec requires the same
    fixup that has been applied to ALC294 codec.  Just copy the entry with
    the pin matching to cover ALC295 too.

    i2c: Prevent runtime suspend of adapter when Host Notify is required
    
    commit 72bfcee11cf89509795c56b0e40a3785ab00bbdd upstream.
    
    Multiple users have reported their Synaptics touchpad has stopped
    working between v4.20.1 and v4.20.2 when using SMBus interface.
    
    The culprit for this appeared to be commit c5eb1190074c ("PCI / PM: Allow
    runtime PM without callback functions") that fixed the runtime PM for
    i2c-i801 SMBus adapter. Those Synaptics touchpad are using i2c-i801
    for SMBus communication and testing showed they are able to get back
    working by preventing the runtime suspend of adapter.
    
    Normally when i2c-i801 SMBus adapter transmits with the client it resumes
    before operation and autosuspends after.
    
    However, if client requires SMBus Host Notify protocol, what those
    Synaptics touchpads do, then the host adapter must not go to runtime
    suspend since then it cannot process incoming SMBus Host Notify commands
    the client may send.
    
    Fix this by keeping I2C/SMBus adapter active in case client requires
    Host Notify.

    i2c: Allow recovery of the initial IRQ by an I2C client device.
    
    commit 93b6604c5a669d84e45fe5129294875bf82eb1ff upstream.
    
    A previous change allowed I2C client devices to discover new IRQs upon
    reprobe by clearing the IRQ in i2c_device_remove. However, if an IRQ was
    assigned in i2c_new_device, that information is lost.
    
    For example, the touchscreen and trackpad devices on a Dell Inspiron laptop
    are I2C devices whose IRQs are defined by ACPI extended IRQ types. The
    client device structures are initialized during an ACPI walk. After
    removing the i2c_hid device, modprobe fails.
    
    This change caches the initial IRQ value in i2c_new_device and then resets
    the client device IRQ to the initial value in i2c_device_remove.

    i2c: Clear client->irq in i2c_device_remove
    
    commit 6f108dd70d3010c391c1e9f56f3f20d1f9e75450 upstream.
    
    The IRQ will be mapped in i2c_device_probe only if client->irq is zero and
    i2c_device_remove does not clear this. When rebinding an I2C device,
    whos IRQ provider has also been rebound this means that an IRQ mapping
    will never be created, causing the I2C device to fail to acquire its
    IRQ. Fix this issue by clearing client->irq in i2c_device_remove,
    forcing i2c_device_probe to lookup the mapping again.

    We need to dereference the directory to get its parent to

    do this with ERR_PTR() pointers. Skip in this case.
    
    It seems that this is most likely what was causing the

    mwifiex: Make resume actually do something useful again on SDIO cards
    
    commit b82d6c1f8f8288f744a9dcc16cd3085d535decca upstream.
    
    The commit fc3a2fcaa1ba ("mwifiex: use atomic bitops to represent
    adapter status variables") had a fairly straightforward bug in it.  It
    contained this bit of diff:
    
     - if (!adapter->is_suspended) {
     + if (test_bit(MWIFIEX_IS_SUSPENDED, &adapter->work_flags)) {
    
    As you can see the patch missed the "!" when converting to the atomic
    bitops.  This meant that the resume hasn't done anything at all since
    that commit landed and suspend/resume for mwifiex SDIO cards has been
    totally broken.
    
    After fixing this mwifiex suspend/resume appears to work again, at
    least with the simple testing I've done.
