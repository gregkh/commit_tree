    sctp: delay auto_asconf init until binding the first addr
    
    commit 34e5b01186858b36c4d7c87e1a025071e8e2401f upstream.
    
    As Or Cohen described:
    
      If sctp_destroy_sock is called without sock_net(sk)->sctp.addr_wq_lock
      held and sp->do_auto_asconf is true, then an element is removed
      from the auto_asconf_splist without any proper locking.
    
      This can happen in the following functions:
      1. In sctp_accept, if sctp_sock_migrate fails.
      2. In inet_create or inet6_create, if there is a bpf program
         attached to BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE which denies
         creation of the sctp socket.
    
    This patch is to fix it by moving the auto_asconf init out of
    sctp_init_sock(), by which inet_create()/inet6_create() won't
    need to operate it in sctp_destroy_sock() when calling
    sk_common_release().
    
    It also makes more sense to do auto_asconf init while binding the
    first addr, as auto_asconf actually requires an ANY addr bind,
    see it in sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler().
    
    This addresses CVE-2021-23133.

    commit 01bfe5e8e428b475982a98a46cca5755726f3f7f upstream.
    
    This reverts commit b166a20b07382b8bc1dcee2a448715c9c2c81b5b.
    
    This one has to be reverted as it introduced a dead lock, as
    syzbot reported:
    
           CPU0                    CPU1
           ----                    ----
      lock(&net->sctp.addr_wq_lock);
                                   lock(slock-AF_INET6);
                                   lock(&net->sctp.addr_wq_lock);
      lock(slock-AF_INET6);
    
    CPU0 is the thread of sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler(), and CPU1
    is that of sctp_close().
    
    The original issue this commit fixed will be fixed in the next
    patch.

    smp: Fix smp_call_function_single_async prototype
    
    commit 1139aeb1c521eb4a050920ce6c64c36c4f2a3ab7 upstream.
    
    As of commit 966a967116e6 ("smp: Avoid using two cache lines for struct
    call_single_data"), the smp code prefers 32-byte aligned call_single_data
    objects for performance reasons, but the block layer includes an instance
    of this structure in the main 'struct request' that is more senstive
    to size than to performance here, see 4ccafe032005 ("block: unalign
    call_single_data in struct request").
    
    The result is a violation of the calling conventions that clang correctly
    points out:
    
    block/blk-mq.c:630:39: warning: passing 8-byte aligned argument to 32-byte aligned parameter 2 of 'smp_call_function_single_async' may result in an unaligned pointer access [-Walign-mismatch]
                    smp_call_function_single_async(cpu, &rq->csd);
    
    It does seem that the usage of the call_single_data without cache line
    alignment should still be allowed by the smp code, so just change the
    function prototype so it accepts both, but leave the default alignment
    unchanged for the other users. This seems better to me than adding
    a local hack to shut up an otherwise correct warning in the caller.

    net: Only allow init netns to set default tcp cong to a restricted algo
    
    commit 8d432592f30fcc34ef5a10aac4887b4897884493 upstream.
    
    tcp_set_default_congestion_control() is netns-safe in that it writes
    to &net->ipv4.tcp_congestion_control, but it also sets
    ca->flags |= TCP_CONG_NON_RESTRICTED which is not namespaced.
    This has the unintended side-effect of changing the global
    net.ipv4.tcp_allowed_congestion_control sysctl, despite the fact that it
    is read-only: 97684f0970f6 ("net: Make tcp_allowed_congestion_control
    readonly in non-init netns")
    
    Resolve this netns "leak" by only allowing the init netns to set the
    default algorithm to one that is restricted. This restriction could be
    removed if tcp_allowed_congestion_control were namespace-ified in the
    future.
    
    This bug was uncovered with
    https://github.com/JonathonReinhart/linux-netns-sysctl-verify

    commit d78050ee35440d7879ed94011c52994b8932e96e upstream.
    
    With the introduction of a dynamic ZONE_DMA range based on DT or IORT
    information, there's no need for CMA allocations from the wider
    ZONE_DMA32 since on most platforms ZONE_DMA will cover the 32-bit
    addressable range. Remove the arm64_dma32_phys_limit and set
    arm64_dma_phys_limit to cover the smallest DMA range required on the
    platform. CMA allocation and crashkernel reservation now go in the
    dynamically sized ZONE_DMA, allowing correct functionality on RPi4.

    bpf: Prevent writable memory-mapping of read-only ringbuf pages
    
    commit 04ea3086c4d73da7009de1e84962a904139af219 upstream.
    
    Only the very first page of BPF ringbuf that contains consumer position
    counter is supposed to be mapped as writeable by user-space. Producer
    position is read-only and can be modified only by the kernel code. BPF ringbuf
    data pages are read-only as well and are not meant to be modified by
    user-code to maintain integrity of per-record headers.
    
    This patch allows to map only consumer position page as writeable and
    everything else is restricted to be read-only. remap_vmalloc_range()
    internally adds VM_DONTEXPAND, so all the established memory mappings can't be
    extended, which prevents any future violations through mremap()'ing.

    bpf: Fix alu32 const subreg bound tracking on bitwise operations
    
    commit 049c4e13714ecbca567b4d5f6d563f05d431c80e upstream.
    
    Fix a bug in the verifier's scalar32_min_max_*() functions which leads to
    incorrect tracking of 32 bit bounds for the simulation of and/or/xor bitops.
    When both the src & dst subreg is a known constant, then the assumption is
    that scalar_min_max_*() will take care to update bounds correctly. However,
    this is not the case, for example, consider a register R2 which has a tnum
    of 0xffffffff00000000, meaning, lower 32 bits are known constant and in this
    case of value 0x00000001. R2 is then and'ed with a register R3 which is a
    64 bit known constant, here, 0x100000002.
    
    What can be seen in line '10:' is that 32 bit bounds reach an invalid state
    where {u,s}32_min_value > {u,s}32_max_value. The reason is scalar32_min_max_*()
    delegates 32 bit bounds updates to scalar_min_max_*(), however, that really
    only takes place when both the 64 bit src & dst register is a known constant.
    Given scalar32_min_max_*() is intended to be designed as closely as possible
    to scalar_min_max_*(), update the 32 bit bounds in this situation through
    __mark_reg32_known() which will set all {u,s}32_{min,max}_value to the correct
    constant, which is 0x00000000 after the fix (given 0x00000001 & 0x00000002 in
    32 bit space). This is possible given var32_off already holds the final value
    as dst_reg->var_off is updated before calling scalar32_min_max_*().
    
    Before fix, invalid tracking of R2:

    afs: Fix speculative status fetches
    
    [ Upstream commit 22650f148126571be1098d34160eb4931fc77241 ]
    
    The generic/464 xfstest causes kAFS to emit occasional warnings of the
    form:
    
            kAFS: vnode modified {100055:8a} 30->31 YFS.StoreData64 (c=6015)
    
    This indicates that the data version received back from the server did not
    match the expected value (the DV should be incremented monotonically for
    each individual modification op committed to a vnode).
    
    What is happening is that a lookup call is doing a bulk status fetch
    speculatively on a bunch of vnodes in a directory besides getting the
    status of the vnode it's actually interested in.  This is racing with a
    StoreData operation (though it could also occur with, say, a MakeDir op).
    
    On the client, a modification operation locks the vnode, but the bulk
    status fetch only locks the parent directory, so no ordering is imposed
    there (thereby avoiding an avenue to deadlock).
    
    On the server, the StoreData op handler doesn't lock the vnode until it's
    received all the request data, and downgrades the lock after committing the
    data until it has finished sending change notifications to other clients -
    which allows the status fetch to occur before it has finished.
    
    This means that:
    
     - a status fetch can access the target vnode either side of the exclusive
       section of the modification
    
     - the status fetch could start before the modification, yet finish after,
       and vice-versa.
    
     - the status fetch and the modification RPCs can complete in either order.
    
     - the status fetch can return either the before or the after DV from the
       modification.
    
     - the status fetch might regress the locally cached DV.
    
    Some of these are handled by the previous fix[1], but that's not sufficient
    because it checks the DV it received against the DV it cached at the start
    of the op, but the DV might've been updated in the meantime by a locally
    generated modification op.
    
    Fix this by the following means:
    
     (1) Keep track of when we're performing a modification operation on a
         vnode.  This is done by marking vnode parameters with a 'modification'
         note that causes the AFS_VNODE_MODIFYING flag to be set on the vnode
         for the duration.
    
     (2) Alter the speculation race detection to ignore speculative status
         fetches if either the vnode is marked as being modified or the data
         version number is not what we expected.
    
    Note that whilst the "vnode modified" warning does get recovered from as it
    causes the client to refetch the status at the next opportunity, it will
    also invalidate the pagecache, so changes might get lost.

    mm: memcontrol: slab: fix obtain a reference to a freeing memcg
    
    [ Upstream commit 9f38f03ae8d5f57371b71aa6b4275765b65454fd ]
    
    Patch series "Use obj_cgroup APIs to charge kmem pages", v5.
    
    Since Roman's series "The new cgroup slab memory controller" applied.
    All slab objects are charged with the new APIs of obj_cgroup.  The new
    APIs introduce a struct obj_cgroup to charge slab objects.  It prevents
    long-living objects from pinning the original memory cgroup in the
    memory.  But there are still some corner objects (e.g.  allocations
    larger than order-1 page on SLUB) which are not charged with the new
    APIs.  Those objects (include the pages which are allocated from buddy
    allocator directly) are charged as kmem pages which still hold a
    reference to the memory cgroup.
    
    E.g.  We know that the kernel stack is charged as kmem pages because the
    size of the kernel stack can be greater than 2 pages (e.g.  16KB on
    x86_64 or arm64).  If we create a thread (suppose the thread stack is
    charged to memory cgroup A) and then move it from memory cgroup A to
    memory cgroup B.  Because the kernel stack of the thread hold a
    reference to the memory cgroup A.  The thread can pin the memory cgroup
    A in the memory even if we remove the cgroup A.  If we want to see this
    scenario by using the following script.  We can see that the system has
    added 500 dying cgroups (This is not a real world issue, just a script
    to show that the large kmallocs are charged as kmem pages which can pin
    the memory cgroup in the memory).
    
            #!/bin/bash
    
            cat /proc/cgroups | grep memory
    
            cd /sys/fs/cgroup/memory
            echo 1 > memory.move_charge_at_immigrate
    
            for i in range{1..500}
            do
                    mkdir kmem_test
                    echo $$ > kmem_test/cgroup.procs
                    sleep 3600 &
                    echo $$ > cgroup.procs
                    echo `cat kmem_test/cgroup.procs` > cgroup.procs
                    rmdir kmem_test
            done
    
            cat /proc/cgroups | grep memory
    
    This patchset aims to make those kmem pages to drop the reference to
    memory cgroup by using the APIs of obj_cgroup.  Finally, we can see that
    the number of the dying cgroups will not increase if we run the above test
    script.
    
    This patch (of 7):
    
    The rcu_read_lock/unlock only can guarantee that the memcg will not be
    freed, but it cannot guarantee the success of css_get (which is in the
    refill_stock when cached memcg changed) to memcg.
    
      rcu_read_lock()
      memcg = obj_cgroup_memcg(old)
      __memcg_kmem_uncharge(memcg)
          refill_stock(memcg)
              if (stock->cached != memcg)
                  // css_get can change the ref counter from 0 back to 1.
                  css_get(&memcg->css)
      rcu_read_unlock()
    
    This fix is very like the commit:
    
      eefbfa7fd678 ("mm: memcg/slab: fix use after free in obj_cgroup_charge")
    
    Fix this by holding a reference to the memcg which is passed to the
    __memcg_kmem_uncharge() before calling __memcg_kmem_uncharge().

    kfifo: fix ternary sign extension bugs
    
    [ Upstream commit 926ee00ea24320052b46745ef4b00d91c05bd03d ]
    
    The intent with this code was to return negative error codes but instead
    it returns positives.
    
    The problem is how type promotion works with ternary operations.  These
    functions return long, "ret" is an int and "copied" is a u32.  The
    negative error code is first cast to u32 so it becomes a high positive and
    then cast to long where it's still a positive.
    
    We could fix this by declaring "ret" as a ssize_t but let's just get rid
    of the ternaries instead.

    Since commit d110162cafc8 ("perf tsc: Support cap_user_time_short for

    structure for clock parameters.
    
    To be backwards-compatible, this patch adds a dedicated swap operation
    for the event PERF_RECORD_TIME_CONV, based on checking if the event
    contains field "time_cycles", it can support both for the old and new
    event formats.

    perf jit: Let convert_timestamp() to be backwards-compatible
    
    [ Upstream commit aa616f5a8a2d22a179d5502ebd85045af66fa656 ]
    
    Commit d110162cafc80dad ("perf tsc: Support cap_user_time_short for
    event TIME_CONV") supports the extended parameters for event TIME_CONV,
    but it broke the backwards compatibility, so any perf data file with old
    event format fails to convert timestamp.
    
    This patch introduces a helper event_contains() to check if an event
    contains a specific member or not.  For the backwards-compatibility, if
    the event size confirms the extended parameters are supported in the
    event TIME_CONV, then copies these parameters.
    
    Committer notes:
    
    To make this compiler backwards compatible add this patch:
    
      -       struct perf_tsc_conversion tc = { 0 };
      +       struct perf_tsc_conversion tc = { .time_shift = 0, };

    net: bridge: mcast: fix broken length + header check for MRDv6 Adv.
    
    [ Upstream commit 99014088156cd78867d19514a0bc771c4b86b93b ]
    
    The IPv6 Multicast Router Advertisements parsing has the following two
    issues:
    
    For one thing, ICMPv6 MRD Advertisements are smaller than ICMPv6 MLD
    messages (ICMPv6 MRD Adv.: 8 bytes vs. ICMPv6 MLDv1/2: >= 24 bytes,
    assuming MLDv2 Reports with at least one multicast address entry).
    When ipv6_mc_check_mld_msg() tries to parse an Multicast Router
    Advertisement its MLD length check will fail - and it will wrongly
    return -EINVAL, even if we have a valid MRD Advertisement. With the
    returned -EINVAL the bridge code will assume a broken packet and will
    wrongly discard it, potentially leading to multicast packet loss towards
    multicast routers.
    
    The second issue is the MRD header parsing in
    br_ip6_multicast_mrd_rcv(): It wrongly checks for an ICMPv6 header
    immediately after the IPv6 header (IPv6 next header type). However
    according to RFC4286, section 2 all MRD messages contain a Router Alert
    option (just like MLD). So instead there is an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option
    for the Router Alert between the IPv6 and ICMPv6 header, again leading
    to the bridge wrongly discarding Multicast Router Advertisements.
    
    To fix these two issues, introduce a new return value -ENODATA to
    ipv6_mc_check_mld() to indicate a valid ICMPv6 packet with a hop-by-hop
    option which is not an MLD but potentially an MRD packet. This also
    simplifies further parsing in the bridge code, as ipv6_mc_check_mld()
    already fully checks the ICMPv6 header and hop-by-hop option.
    
    These issues were found and fixed with the help of the mrdisc tool
    (https://github.com/troglobit/mrdisc).

    RDMA/siw: Fix a use after free in siw_alloc_mr
    
    [ Upstream commit 3093ee182f01689b89e9f8797b321603e5de4f63 ]
    
    Our code analyzer reported a UAF.
    
    In siw_alloc_mr(), it calls siw_mr_add_mem(mr,..). In the implementation of
    siw_mr_add_mem(), mem is assigned to mr->mem and then mem is freed via
    kfree(mem) if xa_alloc_cyclic() failed. Here, mr->mem still point to a
    freed object. After, the execution continue up to the err_out branch of
    siw_alloc_mr, and the freed mr->mem is used in siw_mr_drop_mem(mr).

    bpf: Fix propagation of 32 bit unsigned bounds from 64 bit bounds
    
    [ Upstream commit 10bf4e83167cc68595b85fd73bb91e8f2c086e36 ]
    
    Similarly as b02709587ea3 ("bpf: Fix propagation of 32-bit signed bounds
    from 64-bit bounds."), we also need to fix the propagation of 32 bit
    unsigned bounds from 64 bit counterparts. That is, really only set the
    u32_{min,max}_value when /both/ {umin,umax}_value safely fit in 32 bit
    space. For example, the register with a umin_value == 1 does /not/ imply
    that u32_min_value is also equal to 1, since umax_value could be much
    larger than 32 bit subregister can hold, and thus u32_min_value is in
    the interval [0,1] instead.
    
    Before fix, invalid tracking result of R2_w=inv1:
    
      [...]
      5: R0_w=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2_w=inv(id=0) R10=fp0
      5: (35) if r2 >= 0x1 goto pc+1
      [...] // goto path
      7: R0=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2=inv(id=0,umin_value=1) R10=fp0
      7: (b6) if w2 <= 0x1 goto pc+1
      [...] // goto path
      9: R0=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2=inv(id=0,smin_value=-9223372036854775807,smax_value=9223372032559808513,umin_value=1,umax_value=18446744069414584321,var_off=(0x1; 0xffffffff00000000),s32_min_value=1,s32_max_value=1,u32_max_value=1) R10=fp0
      9: (bc) w2 = w2
      10: R0=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2_w=inv1 R10=fp0
      [...]
    
    After fix, correct tracking result of R2_w=inv(id=0,umax_value=1,var_off=(0x0; 0x1)):
    
      [...]
      5: R0_w=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2_w=inv(id=0) R10=fp0
      5: (35) if r2 >= 0x1 goto pc+1
      [...] // goto path
      7: R0=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2=inv(id=0,umin_value=1) R10=fp0
      7: (b6) if w2 <= 0x1 goto pc+1
      [...] // goto path
      9: R0=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2=inv(id=0,smax_value=9223372032559808513,umax_value=18446744069414584321,var_off=(0x0; 0xffffffff00000001),s32_min_value=0,s32_max_value=1,u32_max_value=1) R10=fp0
      9: (bc) w2 = w2
      10: R0=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2_w=inv(id=0,umax_value=1,var_off=(0x0; 0x1)) R10=fp0
      [...]
    
    Thus, same issue as in b02709587ea3 holds for unsigned subregister tracking.
    Also, align __reg64_bound_u32() similarly to __reg64_bound_s32() as done in
    b02709587ea3 to make them uniform again.

    Fix failed tests checks in core_reloc test runner, which allowed failing tests
    to pass quietly. Also add extra check to make sure that expected to fail test cases with
    invalid names are caught as test failure anyway, as this is not an expected
    failure mode. Also fix mislabeled probed vs direct bitfield test cases.

    selftests/bpf: Fix field existence CO-RE reloc tests
    
    [ Upstream commit 5a30eb23922b52f33222c6729b6b3ff1c37a6c66 ]
    
    Negative field existence cases for have a broken assumption that FIELD_EXISTS
    CO-RE relo will fail for fields that match the name but have incompatible type
    signature. That's not how CO-RE relocations generally behave. Types and fields
    that match by name but not by expected type are treated as non-matching
    candidates and are skipped. Error later is reported if no matching candidate
    was found. That's what happens for most relocations, but existence relocations
    (FIELD_EXISTS and TYPE_EXISTS) are more permissive and they are designed to
    return 0 or 1, depending if a match is found. This allows to handle
    name-conflicting but incompatible types in BPF code easily. Combined with
    ___flavor suffixes, it's possible to handle pretty much any structural type
    changes in kernel within the compiled once BPF source code.
    
    So, long story short, negative field existence test cases are invalid in their
    assumptions, so this patch reworks them into a single consolidated positive
    case that doesn't match any of the fields.

    selftests/bpf: Fix BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD() macro
    
    [ Upstream commit 0f20615d64ee2ad5e2a133a812382d0c4071589b ]
    
    Fix BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD() macro used for reading CO-RE-relocatable
    bitfields. Missing breaks in a switch caused 8-byte reads always. This can
    confuse libbpf because it does strict checks that memory load size corresponds
    to the original size of the field, which in this case quite often would be
    wrong.
    
    After fixing that, we run into another problem, which quite subtle, so worth
    documenting here. The issue is in Clang optimization and CO-RE relocation
    interactions. Without that asm volatile construct (also known as
    barrier_var()), Clang will re-order BYTE_OFFSET and BYTE_SIZE relocations and
    will apply BYTE_OFFSET 4 times for each switch case arm. This will result in
    the same error from libbpf about mismatch of memory load size and original
    field size. I.e., if we were reading u32, we'd still have *(u8 *), *(u16 *),
    *(u32 *), and *(u64 *) memory loads, three of which will fail. Using
    barrier_var() forces Clang to apply BYTE_OFFSET relocation first (and once) to
    calculate p, after which value of p is used without relocation in each of
    switch case arms, doing appropiately-sized memory load.
    
    Here's the list of relevant relocations and pieces of generated BPF code
    before and after this patch for test_core_reloc_bitfields_direct selftests.

    dev_kfree_skb(skb) in error branch of emac_tx_fill_tpd().
    But the freed skb is still used via skb->len by netdev_sent_queue(,skb->len).
    
    As i observed that emac_tx_fill_tpd() haven't modified the value of skb->len,
    thus my patch assigns skb->len to 'len' before the possible free and
    use 'len' instead of skb->len later.

    KVM: VMX: Intercept FS/GS_BASE MSR accesses for 32-bit KVM
    
    [ Upstream commit dbdd096a5a74b94f6b786a47baef2085859b0dce ]
    
    Disable pass-through of the FS and GS base MSRs for 32-bit KVM.  Intel's
    SDM unequivocally states that the MSRs exist if and only if the CPU
    supports x86-64.  FS_BASE and GS_BASE are mostly a non-issue; a clever
    guest could opportunistically use the MSRs without issue.  KERNEL_GS_BASE
    is a bigger problem, as a clever guest would subtly be broken if it were
    migrated, as KVM disallows software access to the MSRs, and unlike the
    direct variants, KERNEL_GS_BASE needs to be explicitly migrated as it's
    not captured in the VMCS.

    bnxt_en: Fix RX consumer index logic in the error path.
    
    [ Upstream commit bbd6f0a948139970f4a615dff189d9a503681a39 ]
    
    In bnxt_rx_pkt(), the RX buffers are expected to complete in order.
    If the RX consumer index indicates an out of order buffer completion,
    it means we are hitting a hardware bug and the driver will abort all
    remaining RX packets and reset the RX ring.  The RX consumer index
    that we pass to bnxt_discard_rx() is not correct.  We should be
    passing the current index (tmp_raw_cons) instead of the old index
    (raw_cons).  This bug can cause us to be at the wrong index when
    trying to abort the next RX packet.  It can crash like this:

    selftests: net: mirror_gre_vlan_bridge_1q: Make an FDB entry static
    
    [ Upstream commit c8d0260cdd96fdccdef0509c4160e28a1012a5d7 ]
    
    The FDB roaming test installs a destination MAC address on the wrong
    interface of an FDB database and tests whether the mirroring fails, because
    packets are sent to the wrong port. The test by mistake installs the FDB
    entry as local. This worked previously, because drivers were notified of
    local FDB entries in the same way as of static entries. However that has
    been fixed in the commit 6ab4c3117aec ("net: bridge: don't notify switchdev
    for local FDB addresses"), and local entries are not notified anymore. As a
    result, the HW is not reconfigured for the FDB roam, and mirroring keeps
    working, failing the test.
    
    To fix the issue, mark the FDB entry as static.

    Modify the header size check in geneve6_xmit_skb and geneve_xmit_skb
    to use pskb_inet_may_pull rather than pskb_network_may_pull. This fixes

    IPv4 over geneve6: PMTU exceptions
    IPv4 over geneve6: PMTU exceptions - nexthop objects
    
    It does this by correctly accounting for the fact that IPv4 packets may
    transit over geneve IPv6 tunnels (and vice versa), and still fixes the

    The problem is that bnxt_show_temp() returns long but "rc" is an int
    and "len" is a u32.  With ternary operations the type promotion is quite
    tricky.  The negative "rc" is first promoted to u32 and then to long so
    it ends up being a high positive value instead of a a negative as we
    intended.
    
    Fix this by removing the ternary.

    [ Upstream commit 8392df5d7e0b6a7d21440da1fc259f9938f4dec3 ]
    
    In ath10k_htc_send_bundle, the bundle_skb could be freed by
    dev_kfree_skb_any(bundle_skb). But the bundle_skb is used later
    by bundle_skb->len.
    
    As skb_len = bundle_skb->len, my patch replaces bundle_skb->len to
    skb_len after the bundle_skb was freed.

    ath9k: Fix error check in ath9k_hw_read_revisions() for PCI devices
    
    [ Upstream commit 7dd9a40fd6e0d0f1fd8e1931c007e080801dfdce ]
    
    When the error check in ath9k_hw_read_revisions() was added, it checked for
    -EIO which is what ath9k_regread() in the ath9k_htc driver uses. However,
    for plain ath9k, the register read function uses ioread32(), which just
    returns -1 on error. So if such a read fails, it still gets passed through
    and ends up as a weird mac revision in the log output.
    
    Fix this by changing ath9k_regread() to return -1 on error like ioread32()
    does, and fix the error check to look for that instead of -EIO.

    powerpc/64: Fix the definition of the fixmap area
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ccba66d4d2aff9a3909aa77d57ea8b7cc166f3c ]
    
    At the time being, the fixmap area is defined at the top of
    the address space or just below KASAN.
    
    This definition is not valid for PPC64.
    
    For PPC64, use the top of the I/O space.
    
    Because of circular dependencies, it is not possible to include
    asm/fixmap.h in asm/book3s/64/pgtable.h , so define a fixed size
    AREA at the top of the I/O space for fixmap and ensure during
    build that the size is big enough.

    [ Upstream commit cb5cd0ea4eb3ce338a593a5331ddb4986ae20faa ]
    
    The device attach triggers addition of CM_ID to the restrack DB.
    However, when error occurs, we releasing this device, but defer CM_ID
    release. This causes to the situation where restrack sees CM_ID that
    is not valid anymore.
    
    As a solution, add the CM_ID to the resource tracking DB only after the
    attachment is finished.

    net: phy: intel-xway: enable integrated led functions
    
    [ Upstream commit 357a07c26697a770d39d28b6b111f978deb4017d ]
    
    The Intel xway phys offer the possibility to deactivate the integrated
    LED function and to control the LEDs manually.
    If this was set by the bootloader, it must be ensured that the
    integrated LED function is enabled for all LEDs when loading the driver.
    
    Before commit 6e2d85ec0559 ("net: phy: Stop with excessive soft reset")
    the LEDs were enabled by a soft-reset of the PHY (using
    genphy_soft_reset). Initialize the XWAY_MDIO_LED with it's default
    value (which is applied during a soft reset) instead of adding back
    the soft reset. This brings back the default LED configuration while
    still preventing an excessive amount of soft resets.

    net: renesas: ravb: Fix a stuck issue when a lot of frames are received
    
    [ Upstream commit 5718458b092bf6bf4482c5df32affba3c3259517 ]
    
    When a lot of frames were received in the short term, the driver
    caused a stuck of receiving until a new frame was received. For example,
    the following command from other device could cause this issue.
    
        $ sudo ping -f -l 1000 -c 1000 <this driver's ipaddress>
    
    The previous code always cleared the interrupt flag of RX but checks
    the interrupt flags in ravb_poll(). So, ravb_poll() could not call
    ravb_rx() in the next time until a new RX frame was received if
    ravb_rx() returned true. To fix the issue, always calls ravb_rx()
    regardless the interrupt flags condition.

    crypto: ccp: Detect and reject "invalid" addresses destined for PSP
    
    [ Upstream commit 74c1f1366eb7714b8b211554f6c5cee315ff3fbc ]
    
    Explicitly reject using pointers that are not virt_to_phys() friendly
    as the source for SEV commands that are sent to the PSP.  The PSP works
    with physical addresses, and __pa()/virt_to_phys() will not return the
    correct address in these cases, e.g. for a vmalloc'd pointer.  At best,
    the bogus address will cause the command to fail, and at worst lead to
    system instability.
    
    While it's unlikely that callers will deliberately use a bad pointer for
    SEV buffers, a caller can easily use a vmalloc'd pointer unknowingly when
    running with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y as it's not obvious that putting the
    command buffers on the stack would be bad.  The command buffers are
    relative  small and easily fit on the stack, and the APIs to do not
    document that the incoming pointer must be a physically contiguous,
    __pa() friendly pointer.

    For some reason there might be a crash during ports creation if port
    events are handling at the same time  because fw may send initial
    port event with down state.
    
    The crash points to cancel_delayed_work() which is called when port went
    is down.  Currently I did not find out the real cause of the issue, so
    fixed it by cancel port stats work only if previous port's state was up
    & runnig.

    vsock/virtio: free queued packets when closing socket
    
    [ Upstream commit 8432b8114957235f42e070a16118a7f750de9d39 ]
    
    As reported by syzbot [1], there is a memory leak while closing the
    socket. We partially solved this issue with commit ac03046ece2b
    ("vsock/virtio: free packets during the socket release"), but we
    forgot to drain the RX queue when the socket is definitely closed by
    the scheduled work.
    
    To avoid future issues, let's use the new virtio_transport_remove_sock()
    to drain the RX queue before removing the socket from the af_vsock lists
    calling vsock_remove_sock().

    We're starting from a TXQ label, not a TXQ type, so
     efx_channel_get_tx_queue() is inappropriate.  This worked by chance,
     because labels and types currently match on EF10, but we shouldn't

    Currently when the call to usb_urb_ep_type_check fails (returning -EINVAL)
    the error return path returns -ENOMEM via the exit label "error". Other
    uses of the same error exit label set the err variable to -ENOMEM but this
    is not being used.  I believe the original intent was for the error exit
    path to return the value in err rather than the hard coded -ENOMEM, so
    return this rather than the hard coded -ENOMEM.

    gro: fix napi_gro_frags() Fast GRO breakage due to IP alignment check
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ad18ff6449cbd6beb26b53128ddf56d2685aa93 ]
    
    Commit 38ec4944b593 ("gro: ensure frag0 meets IP header alignment")
    did the right thing, but missed the fact that napi_gro_frags() logics
    calls for skb_gro_reset_offset() *before* pulling Ethernet header
    to the skb linear space.
    That said, the introduced check for frag0 address being aligned to 4
    always fails for it as Ethernet header is obviously 14 bytes long,
    and in case with NET_IP_ALIGN its start is not aligned to 4.
    
    Fix this by adding @nhoff argument to skb_gro_reset_offset() which
    tells if an IP header is placed right at the start of frag0 or not.
    This restores Fast GRO for napi_gro_frags() that became very slow
    after the mentioned commit, and preserves the introduced check to
    avoid silent unaligned accesses.
    
    From v1 [0]:
     - inline tiny skb_gro_reset_offset() to let the code be optimized
       more efficively (esp. for the !NET_IP_ALIGN case) (Eric);
     - pull in Reviewed-by from Eric.

    [ Upstream commit e16edc99d658cd41c60a44cc14d170697aa3271f ]
    
    VMCI feature is not supported in conjunction with the vSphere Fault
    Tolerance (FT) feature.
    
    VMware Tools can repeatedly try to create a vsock connection. If FT is
    enabled the kernel logs is flooded with the following messages:
    
        qp_alloc_hypercall result = -20
        Could not attach to queue pair with -20
    
    "qp_alloc_hypercall result = -20" was hidden by commit e8266c4c3307
    ("VMCI: Stop log spew when qp allocation isn't possible"), but "Could
    not attach to queue pair with -20" is still there flooding the log.
    
    Since the error message can be useful in some cases, print it only once.

    netfilter: nftables_offload: special ethertype handling for VLAN
    
    [ Upstream commit 783003f3bb8a565326e89d18bbd948ad8ffc816a ]
    
    The nftables offload parser sets FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_BASIC .n_proto to the
    ethertype field in the ethertype frame. However:
    
    - FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_BASIC .n_proto field always stores either IPv4 or IPv6
      ethertypes.
    - FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_VLAN .vlan_tpid stores either the 802.1q and 802.1ad
      ethertypes. Same as for FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_CVLAN.
    
    This function adjusts the flow dissector to handle two scenarios:
    
    1) FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_VLAN .vlan_tpid is set to 802.1q or 802.1ad.
       Then, transfer:
       - the .n_proto field to FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_VLAN .tpid.
       - the original FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_VLAN .tpid to the
         FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_CVLAN .tpid
       - the original FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_CVLAN .tpid to the .n_proto field.
    
    2) .n_proto is set to 802.1q or 802.1ad. Then, transfer:
       - the .n_proto field to FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_VLAN .tpid.
       - the original FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_VLAN .tpid to the .n_proto field.

    not available (an older processor or explicitly disabled) or not
    used (host and guest values are the same), reading GUEST_IA32_EFER
    from the VMCS returns an inaccurate value.
    
    Because of this, in dump_vmcs() don't use GUEST_IA32_EFER to decide
    whether to print the PDPTRs - always do so if the fields exist.

    powerpc/smp: Reintroduce cpu_core_mask
    
    [ Upstream commit c47f892d7aa62765bf0689073f75990b4517a4cf ]
    
    Daniel reported that with Commit 4ca234a9cbd7 ("powerpc/smp: Stop
    updating cpu_core_mask") QEMU was unable to set single NUMA node SMP
    topologies such as:
     -smp 8,maxcpus=8,cores=2,threads=2,sockets=2
     i.e he expected 2 sockets in one NUMA node.
    
    The above commit helped to reduce boot time on Large Systems for
    example 4096 vCPU single socket QEMU instance. PAPR is silent on
    having more than one socket within a NUMA node.
    
    cpu_core_mask and cpu_cpu_mask for any CPU would be same unless the
    number of sockets is different from the number of NUMA nodes.
    
    One option is to reintroduce cpu_core_mask but use a slightly
    different method to arrive at the cpu_core_mask. Previously each CPU's
    chip-id would be compared with all other CPU's chip-id to verify if
    both the CPUs were related at the chip level. Now if a CPU 'A' is
    found related / (unrelated) to another CPU 'B', all the thread
    siblings of 'A' and thread siblings of 'B' are automatically marked as
    related / (unrelated).
    
    Also if a platform doesn't support ibm,chip-id property, i.e its
    cpu_to_chip_id returns -1, cpu_core_map holds a copy of
    cpu_cpu_mask().

    MIPS: pci-legacy: stop using of_pci_range_to_resource
    
    [ Upstream commit 3ecb9dc1581eebecaee56decac70e35365260866 ]
    
    Mirror commit aeba3731b150 ("powerpc/pci: Fix IO space breakage after
    of_pci_range_to_resource() change").
    
    Most MIPS platforms do not define PCI_IOBASE, nor implement
    pci_address_to_pio(). Moreover, IO_SPACE_LIMIT is 0xffff for most MIPS
    platforms. of_pci_range_to_resource passes the _start address_ of the IO
    range into pci_address_to_pio, which then checks it against
    IO_SPACE_LIMIT and fails, because for MIPS platforms that use
    pci-legacy (pci-lantiq, pci-rt3883, pci-mt7620), IO ranges start much
    higher than 0xffff.
    
    In fact, pci-mt7621 in staging already works around this problem, see
    commit 09dd629eeabb ("staging: mt7621-pci: fix io space and properly set
    resource limits")
    
    So just stop using of_pci_range_to_resource, which does not work for
    MIPS.
    
    Fixes PCI errors like:
      pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0xffffffff]

    Increase PACKET_FANOUT_MAX to 64K. Expand setsockopt PACKET_FANOUT to
    take an extra argument max_num_members. Also explicitly define a
    fanout_args struct, instead of implicitly casting to an integer. This
    documents the API and simplifies the control flow.

    powerpc/xive: Fix xmon command "dxi"
    
    [ Upstream commit 33e4bc5946432a4ac173fd08e8e30a13ab94d06d ]
    
    When under xmon, the "dxi" command dumps the state of the XIVE
    interrupts. If an interrupt number is specified, only the state of
    the associated XIVE interrupt is dumped. This form of the command
    lacks an irq_data parameter which is nevertheless used by
    xmon_xive_get_irq_config(), leading to an xmon crash.
    
    Fix that by doing a lookup in the system IRQ mapping to query the IRQ
    descriptor data. Invalid interrupt numbers, or not belonging to the
    XIVE IRQ domain, OPAL event interrupt number for instance, should be
    caught by the previous query done at the firmware level.

    i2c: rcar: protect against supurious interrupts on V3U
    
    [ Upstream commit 9c975c432bc0aa53a90438fc80b369cb35134a48 ]
    
    V3U creates spurious interrupts which we need to handle. This costs time
    until BUS_PHASE_DATA can be activated which is problematic for Gen2 SoCs
    and earlier. Because of this we introduce two interrupt handlers here
    which will call a generic main irq function once the timing critical
    stuff is done.

    RDMA/rtrs-clt: destroy sysfs after removing session from active list
    
    [ Upstream commit 7f4a8592ff29f19c5a2ca549d0973821319afaad ]
    
    A session can be removed dynamically by sysfs interface "remove_path" that
    eventually calls rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs function.  The current
    rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs first removes the sysfs interfaces and
    frees sess->stats object. Second it removes the session from the active
    list.
    
    Therefore some functions could access non-connected session and access the
    freed sess->stats object even-if they check the session status before
    accessing the session.
    
    For instance rtrs_clt_request and get_next_path_min_inflight check the
    session status and try to send IO to the session.  The session status
    could be changed when they are trying to send IO but they could not catch
    the change and update the statistics information in sess->stats object,
    and generate use-after-free problem.
    (see: "RDMA/rtrs-clt: Check state of the rtrs_clt_sess before reading its
    stats")
    
    This patch changes the rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs to remove the
    session from the active session list and then destroy the sysfs
    interfaces.
    
    Each function still should check the session status because closing or
    error recovery paths can change the status.

    ovl: invalidate readdir cache on changes to dir with origin
    
    [ Upstream commit 65cd913ec9d9d71529665924c81015b7ab7d9381 ]
    
    The test in ovl_dentry_version_inc() was out-dated and did not include
    the case where readdir cache is used on a non-merge dir that has origin
    xattr, indicating that it may contain leftover whiteouts.
    
    To make the code more robust, use the same helper ovl_dir_is_real()
    to determine if readdir cache should be used and if readdir cache should
    be invalidated.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Restore host CTRL SPR after guest exit
    
    [ Upstream commit 5088eb4092df12d701af8e0e92860b7186365279 ]
    
    The host CTRL (runlatch) value is not restored after guest exit. The
    host CTRL should always be 1 except in CPU idle code, so this can result
    in the host running with runlatch clear, and potentially switching to
    a different vCPU which then runs with runlatch clear as well.
    
    This has little effect on P9 machines, CTRL is only responsible for some
    PMU counter logic in the host and so other than corner cases of software
    relying on that, or explicitly reading the runlatch value (Linux does
    not appear to be affected but it's possible non-Linux guests could be),
    there should be no execution correctness problem, though it could be
    used as a covert channel between guests.
    
    There may be microcontrollers, firmware or monitoring tools that sample
    the runlatch value out-of-band, however since the register is writable
    by guests, these values would (should) not be relied upon for correct
    operation of the host, so suboptimal performance or incorrect reporting
    should be the worst problem.

    mt7601u: fix always true expression
    
    [ Upstream commit 87fce88658ba047ae62e83497d3f3c5dc22fa6f9 ]
    
    Currently the expression ~nic_conf1 is always true because nic_conf1
    is a u16 and according to 6.5.3.3 of the C standard the ~ operator
    promotes the u16 to an integer before flipping all the bits. Thus
    the top 16 bits of the integer result are all set so the expression
    is always true.  If the intention was to flip all the bits of nic_conf1
    then casting the integer result back to a u16 is a suitabel fix.
    
    Interestingly static analyzers seem to thing a bitwise ! should be
    used instead of ~ for this scenario, so I think the original intent
    of the expression may need some extra consideration.

    error if error is set; however error now is uninitialized
    so potentially garbage is being returned.  Fix this by setting
    error to zero to restore the original behaviour where error
    was zero at the label 'restart'.

    perf vendor events amd: Fix broken L2 Cache Hits from L2 HWPF metric
    
    [ Upstream commit 86c2bc3da769124e3e856b6e9457be3667c30919 ]
    
    Commit 08ed77e414ab2342 ("perf vendor events amd: Add recommended events")
    added the hits event "L2 Cache Hits from L2 HWPF" with the same metric
    expression as the accesses event "L2 Cache Accesses from L2 HWPF":
    
    $ perf list --details
    ...
      l2_cache_accesses_from_l2_hwpf
         [L2 Cache Accesses from L2 HWPF]
         [l2_pf_hit_l2 + l2_pf_miss_l2_hit_l3 + l2_pf_miss_l2_l3]
      l2_cache_hits_from_l2_hwpf
         [L2 Cache Hits from L2 HWPF]
         [l2_pf_hit_l2 + l2_pf_miss_l2_hit_l3 + l2_pf_miss_l2_l3]
    ...
    
    This was wrong and led to counting hits the same as accesses. Section
    2.1.15.2 "Performance Measurement" of "PPR for AMD Family 17h Model 31h
    B0 - 55803 Rev 0.54 - Sep 12, 2019", documents the hits event with
    EventCode 0x70 which is the same as l2_pf_hit_l2.
    
    Fix this, and massage the description for l2_pf_hit_l2 as the hits event
    is now the duplicate of l2_pf_hit_l2. AMD recommends using the recommended
    event over other events if the duplicate exists and maintain both for
    consistency. Hence, l2_cache_hits_from_l2_hwpf should override
    l2_pf_hit_l2.
    
    Before:
    
     # perf stat -M l2_cache_accesses_from_l2_hwpf,l2_cache_hits_from_l2_hwpf sleep 1
    
     Performance counter stats for 'sleep 1':
    
                 1,436      l2_pf_miss_l2_l3          # 11114.00 l2_cache_accesses_from_l2_hwpf

                 1,477      l2_pf_miss_l2_l3          # 10442.00 l2_cache_accesses_from_l2_hwpf
                 3,978      l2_pf_hit_l2
                 4,987      l2_pf_miss_l2_hit_l3

    Note the difference in performance counter values for the accesses
    versus the hits after the fix, and the hits event now counting the same
    as l2_pf_hit_l2.

    If any of the cipher schemes specified by the driver are invalid, bail
    out and fail the registration rather than just warning.  Otherwise, we
    might later crash when we try to use the invalid cipher scheme, e.g.
    if the hdr_len is (significantly) less than the pn_offs + pn_len, we'd
    have an out-of-bounds access in RX validation.

    powerpc/perf: Fix PMU constraint check for EBB events
    
    [ Upstream commit 10f8f96179ecc7f69c927f6d231f6d02736cea83 ]
    
    The power PMU group constraints includes check for EBB events to make
    sure all events in a group must agree on EBB. This will prevent
    scheduling EBB and non-EBB events together. But in the existing check,
    settings for constraint mask and value is interchanged. Patch fixes the
    same.
    
    Before the patch, PMU selftest "cpu_event_pinned_vs_ebb_test" fails with
    below in dmesg logs. This happens because EBB event gets enabled along
    with a non-EBB cpu event.

    powerpc/64s: Fix pte update for kernel memory on radix
    
    [ Upstream commit b8b2f37cf632434456182e9002d63cbc4cccc50c ]
    
    When adding a PTE a ptesync is needed to order the update of the PTE
    with subsequent accesses otherwise a spurious fault may be raised.
    
    radix__set_pte_at() does not do this for performance gains. For
    non-kernel memory this is not an issue as any faults of this kind are
    corrected by the page fault handler. For kernel memory these faults
    are not handled. The current solution is that there is a ptesync in
    flush_cache_vmap() which should be called when mapping from the
    vmalloc region.
    
    However, map_kernel_page() does not call flush_cache_vmap(). This is
    troublesome in particular for code patching with Strict RWX on radix.
    In do_patch_instruction() the page frame that contains the instruction
    to be patched is mapped and then immediately patched. With no ordering
    or synchronization between setting up the PTE and writing to the page
    it is possible for faults.
    
    As the code patching is done using __put_user_asm_goto() the resulting
    fault is obscured - but using a normal store instead it can be seen:
    
      BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access on write at 0xc008000008f24a3c
      Faulting instruction address: 0xc00000000008bd74

    IB/hfi1: Use kzalloc() for mmu_rb_handler allocation
    
    [ Upstream commit ca5f72568e034e1295a7ae350b1f786fcbfb2848 ]
    
    The code currently assumes that the mmu_notifier struct
    embedded in mmu_rb_handler only contains two fields.
    
    There are now extra fields:
    
    struct mmu_notifier {
            struct hlist_node hlist;
            const struct mmu_notifier_ops *ops;
            struct mm_struct *mm;
            struct rcu_head rcu;
            unsigned int users;
    };
    
    Given that there in no init for the mmu_notifier, a kzalloc() should
    be used to insure that any newly added fields are given a predictable
    initial value of zero.

    liquidio: Fix unintented sign extension of a left shift of a u16
    
    [ Upstream commit 298b58f00c0f86868ea717426beb5c1198772f81 ]
    
    The macro CN23XX_PEM_BAR1_INDEX_REG is being used to shift oct->pcie_port
    (a u16) left 24 places. There are two subtle issues here, first the
    shift gets promoted to an signed int and then sign extended to a u64.
    If oct->pcie_port is 0x80 or more then the upper bits get sign extended
    to 1. Secondly shfiting a u16 24 bits will lead to an overflow so it
    needs to be cast to a u64 for all the bits to not overflow.
    
    It is entirely possible that the u16 port value is never large enough
    for this to fail, but it is useful to fix unintended overflows such
    as this.
    
    Fix this by casting the port parameter to the macro to a u64 before
    the shift.

    KVM: arm64: Initialize VCPU mdcr_el2 before loading it
    
    [ Upstream commit 263d6287da1433aba11c5b4046388f2cdf49675c ]
    
    When a VCPU is created, the kvm_vcpu struct is initialized to zero in
    kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu(). On VHE systems, the first time
    vcpu.arch.mdcr_el2 is loaded on hardware is in vcpu_load(), before it is
    set to a sensible value in kvm_arm_setup_debug() later in the run loop. The
    result is that KVM executes for a short time with MDCR_EL2 set to zero.
    
    This has several unintended consequences:
    
    * Setting MDCR_EL2.HPMN to 0 is constrained unpredictable according to ARM
      DDI 0487G.a, page D13-3820. The behavior specified by the architecture
      in this case is for the PE to behave as if MDCR_EL2.HPMN is set to a
      value less than or equal to PMCR_EL0.N, which means that an unknown
      number of counters are now disabled by MDCR_EL2.HPME, which is zero.
    
    * The host configuration for the other debug features controlled by
      MDCR_EL2 is temporarily lost. This has been harmless so far, as Linux
      doesn't use the other fields, but that might change in the future.
    
    Let's avoid both issues by initializing the VCPU's mdcr_el2 field in
    kvm_vcpu_vcpu_first_run_init(), thus making sure that the MDCR_EL2 register
    has a consistent value after each vcpu_load().

    HID: lenovo: Map mic-mute button to KEY_F20 instead of KEY_MICMUTE
    
    [ Upstream commit 617103246cfd19af837e4cb614ba9f877c4f7779 ]
    
    Mapping the mic-mute button to KEY_MICMUTE is technically correct but
    KEY_MICMUTE translates to a scancode of 256 (248 + 8) under X,
    which does not fit in 8 bits, so it does not work.
    
    Because of this userspace is expecting KEY_F20 instead,
    theoretically KEY_MICMUTE should work under Wayland but even
    there it does not work, because the desktop-environment is
    listening only for KEY_F20 and not for KEY_MICMUTE.

    HID: lenovo: Check hid_get_drvdata() returns non NULL in lenovo_event()
    
    [ Upstream commit 34348a8661e3cd67dcf6938f08c8bb77522301f7 ]
    
    The HID lenovo probe function only attaches drvdata to one of the
    USB interfaces, but lenovo_event() will get called for all USB interfaces
    to which hid-lenovo is bound.
    
    This allows a malicious device to fake being a device handled by
    hid-lenovo, which generates events for which lenovo_event() has
    special handling (and thus dereferences hid_get_drvdata()) on another
    interface triggering a NULL pointer exception.
    
    Add a check for hid_get_drvdata() returning NULL, avoiding this
    possible NULL pointer exception.

    Fix the following issues with lenovo_led_set_tp10ubkbd() error handling:
    
    1. On success hid_hw_raw_request() returns the number of bytes sent.
       So we should check for (ret != 3) rather then for (ret != 0).
    
    2. Actually propagate errors to the caller.
    
    3. Since the LEDs are part of an USB keyboard-dock the mute LEDs can go
       away at any time. Don't log an error when ret == -ENODEV and set the
       LED_HW_PLUGGABLE flag to avoid errors getting logged when the USB gets
       disconnected.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Add error checks for usb_driver_claim_interface() calls
    
    [ Upstream commit 5fb45414ae03421255593fd5556aa2d1d82303aa ]
    
    There are a few calls of usb_driver_claim_interface() but all of those
    miss the proper error checks, as reported by Coverity.  This patch
    adds those missing checks.
    
    Along with it, replace the magic pointer with -1 with a constant
    USB_AUDIO_IFACE_UNUSED for better readability.

    iommu/vt-d: Remove WO permissions on second-level paging entries
    
    [ Upstream commit eea53c5816889ee8b64544fa2e9311a81184ff9c ]
    
    When the first level page table is used for IOVA translation, it only
    supports Read-Only and Read-Write permissions. The Write-Only permission
    is not supported as the PRESENT bit (implying Read permission) should
    always set. When using second level, we still give separate permissions
    that allows WriteOnly which seems inconsistent and awkward. We want to
    have consistent behavior. After moving to 1st level, we don't want things
    to work sometimes, and break if we use 2nd level for the same mappings.
    Hence remove this configuration.

    The Access/Dirty bits in the first level page table entry will be set

    permission was successfully translated. This is always true when using
    the first-level page table for kernel IOVA. Instead of wasting hardware

    The Intel VT-d driver checks wrong register to report snoop capablility
    when using first level page table for GPA to HPA translation. This might
    lead the IOMMU driver to say that it supports snooping control, but in
    reality, it does not. Fix this by always setting PASID-table-entry.PGSNP
    whenever a pasid entry is setting up for GPA to HPA translation so that
    the IOMMU driver could report snoop capability as long as it runs in the
    scalable mode.

    kunpeng ARM64 platform.
    We find that the range [start1, end1) actually is joint from the range
    [end1, end2), but it is considered as disjoint after the change,
    so it needs more times of TLB sync, and spends more time on it.
    So fix the boundary issue to avoid performance drop.

    RDMA/core: Fix corrupted SL on passive side
    
    [ Upstream commit 194f64a3cad3ab9e381e996a13089de3215d1887 ]
    
    On RoCE systems, a CM REQ contains a Primary Hop Limit > 1 and Primary
    Subnet Local is zero.
    
    In cm_req_handler(), the cm_process_routed_req() function is called. Since
    the Primary Subnet Local value is zero in the request, and since this is
    RoCE (Primary Local LID is permissive), the following statement will be
    executed:
    
          IBA_SET(CM_REQ_PRIMARY_SL, req_msg, wc->sl);
    
    This corrupts SL in req_msg if it was different from zero. In other words,
    a request to setup a connection using an SL != zero, will not be honored,
    and a connection using SL zero will be created instead.
    
    Fixed by not calling cm_process_routed_req() on RoCE systems, the
    cm_process_route_req() is only for IB anyhow.

    powerpc/pseries: Only register vio drivers if vio bus exists
    
    [ Upstream commit 11d92156f7a862091009d7655d19c1e7de37fc7a ]
    
    The vio bus is a fake bus, which we use on pseries LPARs (guests) to
    discover devices provided by the hypervisor. There's no need or sense
    in creating the vio bus on bare metal systems.
    
    Which is why commit 4336b9337824 ("powerpc/pseries: Make vio and
    ibmebus initcalls pseries specific") made the initialisation of the
    vio bus only happen in LPARs.
    
    However as a result of that commit we now see errors at boot on bare
    metal systems:
    
      Driver 'hvc_console' was unable to register with bus_type 'vio' because the bus was not initialized.
      Driver 'tpm_ibmvtpm' was unable to register with bus_type 'vio' because the bus was not initialized.
    
    This happens because those drivers are built-in, and are calling
    vio_register_driver(). It in turn calls driver_register() with a
    reference to vio_bus_type, but we haven't registered vio_bus_type with
    the driver core.
    
    Fix it by also guarding vio_register_driver() with a check to see if
    we are on pseries.

    gpio: guard gpiochip_irqchip_add_domain() with GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP
    
    [ Upstream commit 9c7d24693d864f90b27aad5d15fbfe226c02898b ]
    
    The current code doesn't check if GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP is enabled, which results in
    a compilation error when trying to build gpio-regmap if CONFIG_GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP
    isn't enabled.

    MIPS/bpf: Enable bpf_probe_read{, str}() on MIPS again
    
    [ Upstream commit 66633abd0642f1e89d26e15f36fb13d3a1c535ff ]
    
    After commit 0ebeea8ca8a4 ("bpf: Restrict bpf_probe_read{, str}() only to
    archs where they work"), bpf_probe_read{, str}() functions were no longer
    available on MIPS, so there exist some errors when running bpf program:

    bpf: Failed to load program: Invalid argument

    ARCH_HAS_NON_OVERLAPPING_ADDRESS_SPACE should be restricted to archs
    with non-overlapping address ranges, but they can overlap in EVA mode
    on MIPS, so select ARCH_HAS_NON_OVERLAPPING_ADDRESS_SPACE if !EVA in
    arch/mips/Kconfig, otherwise the bpf old helper bpf_probe_read() will

    Initial drop action support missed that drop action can be added to egress
    flow tables as well. Add the missing support.
    
    This requires making sure that dest_type isn't set to PORT which in turn
    exposes a possibility of passing dst while indicating number of dsts as
    zero. Explicitly check for number of dsts and pass the appropriate

    ASoC: wm8960: Remove bitclk relax condition in wm8960_configure_sysclk
    
    [ Upstream commit 99067c07e8d877035f6249d194a317c78b7d052d ]
    
    The call sequence in wm8960_configure_clocking is
    
       ret = wm8960_configure_sysclk();
       if (ret >= 0)
            goto configure_clock;
    
       ....
    
       ret = wm8960_configure_pll();
    
    configure_clock:
       ...
    
    wm8960_configure_sysclk is called before wm8960_configure_pll, as
    there is bitclk relax on both functions, so wm8960_configure_sysclk
    always return success, then wm8960_configure_pll() never be called.
    
    With this case:
    aplay -Dhw:0,0 -d 5 -r 48000 -f S24_LE -c 2 audio48k24b2c.wav
    the required bitclk is 48000 * 24 * 2 = 2304000, bitclk got from
    wm8960_configure_sysclk is 3072000, but if go to wm8960_configure_pll.
    it can get correct bitclk 2304000.
    
    So bitclk relax condition should be removed in wm8960_configure_sysclk,
    then wm8960_configure_pll can be called, and there is also bitclk relax
    function in wm8960_configure_pll.

    libbpf: Add explicit padding to btf_dump_emit_type_decl_opts
    
    [ Upstream commit ea24b19562fe5f72c78319dbb347b701818956d9 ]
    
    Similar to
    https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20210313210920.1959628-2-andrii@kernel.org/
    
    When DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS is used with inline field initialization, e.g:
    
      DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS(btf_dump_emit_type_decl_opts, opts,
        .field_name = var_ident,
        .indent_level = 2,
        .strip_mods = strip_mods,
      );
    
    and compiled in debug mode, the compiler generates code which
    leaves the padding uninitialized and triggers errors within libbpf APIs
    which require strict zero initialization of OPTS structs.
    
    Adding anonymous padding field fixes the issue.

    libbpf: Add explicit padding to bpf_xdp_set_link_opts
    
    [ Upstream commit dde7b3f5f2f458297aeccfd4783e53ab8ca046db ]
    
    Adding such anonymous padding fixes the issue with uninitialized portions of

    initialization:
    
    DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS(bpf_xdp_set_link_opts, opts, .old_fd = -1);
    
    When such code is compiled in debug mode, compiler is generating code that
    leaves padding bytes uninitialized, which triggers error inside libbpf APIs
    that do strict zero initialization checks for OPTS structs.

    net: lapbether: Prevent racing when checking whether the netif is running
    
    [ Upstream commit 5acd0cfbfbb5a688da1bfb1a2152b0c855115a35 ]
    
    There are two "netif_running" checks in this driver. One is in
    "lapbeth_xmit" and the other is in "lapbeth_rcv". They serve to make
    sure that the LAPB APIs called in these functions are called before
    "lapb_unregister" is called by the "ndo_stop" function.
    
    However, these "netif_running" checks are unreliable, because it's
    possible that immediately after "netif_running" returns true, "ndo_stop"
    is called (which causes "lapb_unregister" to be called).
    
    This patch adds locking to make sure "lapbeth_xmit" and "lapbeth_rcv" can
    reliably check and ensure the netif is running while doing their work.

    Bluetooth: avoid deadlock between hci_dev->lock and socket lock
    
    [ Upstream commit 17486960d79b900c45e0bb8fbcac0262848582ba ]
    
    Commit eab2404ba798 ("Bluetooth: Add BT_PHY socket option") added a
    dependency between socket lock and hci_dev->lock that could lead to
    deadlock.
    
    It turns out that hci_conn_get_phy() is not in any way relying on hdev
    being immutable during the runtime of this function, neither does it even
    look at any of the members of hdev, and as such there is no need to hold
    that lock.
    
    This fixes the lockdep splat below:

    KVM: x86/mmu: Retry page faults that hit an invalid memslot
    
    [ Upstream commit e0c378684b6545ad2d4403bb701d0ac4932b4e95 ]
    
    Retry page faults (re-enter the guest) that hit an invalid memslot
    instead of treating the memslot as not existing, i.e. handling the
    page fault as an MMIO access.  When deleting a memslot, SPTEs aren't
    zapped and the TLBs aren't flushed until after the memslot has been
    marked invalid.
    
    Handling the invalid slot as MMIO means there's a small window where a
    page fault could replace a valid SPTE with an MMIO SPTE.  The legacy
    MMU handles such a scenario cleanly, but the TDP MMU assumes such
    behavior is impossible (see the BUG() in __handle_changed_spte()).
    There's really no good reason why the legacy MMU should allow such a
    scenario, and closing this hole allows for additional cleanups.

    ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Compile when any configuration is selected
    
    [ Upstream commit 1b99d50b9709a2cddaba4a7faf1862b4f7bec865 ]
    
    Skylake is dependent on SND_SOC_INTEL_SKYLAKE (aka "all SST platforms")
    whereas selecting specific configuration such as KBL-only will not
    cause driver code to compile. Switch to SND_SOC_INTEL_SKYLAKE_COMMON
    dependency so selecting any configuration causes the driver to be built.

    HID: plantronics: Workaround for double volume key presses
    
    [ Upstream commit f567d6ef8606fb427636e824c867229ecb5aefab ]
    
    Plantronics Blackwire 3220 Series (047f:c056) sends HID reports twice
    for each volume key press. This patch adds a quirk to hid-plantronics
    for this product ID, which will ignore the second volume key press if
    it happens within 5 ms from the last one that was handled.
    
    The patch was tested on the mentioned model only, it shouldn't affect
    other models, however, this quirk might be needed for them too.
    Auto-repeat (when a key is held pressed) is not affected, because the
    rate is about 3 times per second, which is far less frequent than once
    in 5 ms.

    xsk: Respect device's headroom and tailroom on generic xmit path
    
    [ Upstream commit 3914d88f7608e6c2e80e344474fa289370c32451 ]
    
    xsk_generic_xmit() allocates a new skb and then queues it for
    xmitting. The size of new skb's headroom is desc->len, so it comes
    to the driver/device with no reserved headroom and/or tailroom.
    Lots of drivers need some headroom (and sometimes tailroom) to
    prepend (and/or append) some headers or data, e.g. CPU tags,
    device-specific headers/descriptors (LSO, TLS etc.), and if case
    of no available space skb_cow_head() will reallocate the skb.
    Reallocations are unwanted on fast-path, especially when it comes
    to XDP, so generic XSK xmit should reserve the spaces declared in
    dev->needed_headroom and dev->needed tailroom to avoid them.
    
    Note on max(NET_SKB_PAD, L1_CACHE_ALIGN(dev->needed_headroom)):
    
    Usually, output functions reserve LL_RESERVED_SPACE(dev), which
    consists of dev->hard_header_len + dev->needed_headroom, aligned
    by 16.
    
    However, on XSK xmit hard header is already here in the chunk, so
    hard_header_len is not needed. But it'd still be better to align
    data up to cacheline, while reserving no less than driver requests
    for headroom. NET_SKB_PAD here is to double-insure there will be
    no reallocations even when the driver advertises no needed_headroom,
    but in fact need it (not so rare case).

    [ Upstream commit 72ce11ddfa4e9e1879103581a60b7e34547eaa0a ]
    
    In null_init, null_add_dev(dev) is called.
    In null_add_dev, it calls null_free_zoned_dev(dev) to free dev->zones
    via kvfree(dev->zones) in out_cleanup_zone branch and returns err.
    Then null_init accept the err code and then calls null_free_dev(dev).
    
    But in null_free_dev(dev), dev->zones is freed again by
    null_free_zoned_dev().
    
    My patch set dev->zones to NULL in null_free_zoned_dev() after
    kvfree(dev->zones) is called, to avoid the double free.

    sched/debug: Fix cgroup_path[] serialization
    
    [ Upstream commit ad789f84c9a145f8a18744c0387cec22ec51651e ]
    
    The handling of sysrq key can be activated by echoing the key to
    /proc/sysrq-trigger or via the magic key sequence typed into a terminal
    that is connected to the system in some way (serial, USB or other mean).
    In the former case, the handling is done in a user context. In the
    latter case, it is likely to be in an interrupt context.
    
    Currently in print_cpu() of kernel/sched/debug.c, sched_debug_lock is
    taken with interrupt disabled for the whole duration of the calls to
    print_*_stats() and print_rq() which could last for the quite some time
    if the information dump happens on the serial console.
    
    If the system has many cpus and the sched_debug_lock is somehow busy
    (e.g. parallel sysrq-t), the system may hit a hard lockup panic
    depending on the actually serial console implementation of the
    system.
    
    The purpose of sched_debug_lock is to serialize the use of the global
    cgroup_path[] buffer in print_cpu(). The rests of the printk calls don't
    need serialization from sched_debug_lock.
    
    Calling printk() with interrupt disabled can still be problematic if
    multiple instances are running. Allocating a stack buffer of PATH_MAX
    bytes is not feasible because of the limited size of the kernel stack.
    
    The solution implemented in this patch is to allow only one caller at a
    time to use the full size group_path[], while other simultaneous callers
    will have to use shorter stack buffers with the possibility of path
    name truncation. A "..." suffix will be printed if truncation may have
    happened.  The cgroup path name is provided for informational purpose
    only, so occasional path name truncation should not be a big problem.

    [ Upstream commit 4917e498c6894ba077867aff78f82cffd5ffbb5c ]
    
    The ARR register is cleared unconditionally upon probing, after the maximum
    value has been read. This initial condition is rather not intuitive, when
    considering the counter child driver. It rather expects the maximum value
    by default:
    - The counter interface shows a zero value by default for 'ceiling'
      attribute.
    - Enabling the counter without any prior configuration makes it doesn't
      count.
    
    The reset value of ARR register is the maximum. So Choice here
    is to backup it, and restore it then, instead of clearing its value.
    It also fixes the initial condition seen by the counter driver.

    which changes the host state to IBMVFC_NO_CRQ. If, prior to setting the
    host state to IBMVFC_NO_CRQ, ibmvfc_init_host() is called, it can then end
    up changing the host action to IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_INIT.  If we then change
    the host state to IBMVFC_NO_CRQ, we will then hit the BUG_ON().
    
    Make a couple of changes to avoid this. Leave the host action to be
    IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_RESET or IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_REENABLE until after we drop
    the host lock and reset or reenable the CRQ. Also harden the host state
    machine to ensure we cannot leave the reset / reenable state until we've
    finished processing the reset or reenable.

    The driver neglects to check the result of platform_get_irq()'s call and

    [ Upstream commit 3f744a14f331f56703a9d74e86520db045f11831 ]
    
    The mpi_uninit_check() takes longer for inbound doorbell register to be
    cleared. Increase the timeout substantially so that the driver does not
    fail to load.
    
    Previously, the inbound doorbell wait time was mistakenly increased in the
    mpi_init_check() instead of mpi_uninit_check(). It is okay to leave the
    mpi_init_check() wait time as-is as these are timeout values and if there
    is a failure, waiting longer is not an issue.

    clk: zynqmp: pll: add set_pll_mode to check condition in zynqmp_pll_enable
    
    [ Upstream commit 394cdb69a3c30b33524cf1204afe5cceaba69cdc ]
    
    If there is a IOCTL_SET_PLL_FRAC_MODE request sent to ATF ever,
    we shouldn't skip invoking PM_CLOCK_ENABLE fn even though this
    pll has been enabled. In ATF implementation, it will only assign
    the mode to the variable (struct pm_pll *)pll->mode when handling
    IOCTL_SET_PLL_FRAC_MODE call. Invoking PM_CLOCK_ENABLE can force
    ATF send request to PWU to set the pll mode to PLL's register.
    
    There is a scenario that happens in enabling VPLL_INT(clk_id:96):
    1) VPLL_INT has been enabled during booting.
    2) A driver calls clk_set_rate and according to the rate, the VPLL_INT
       should be set to FRAC mode. Then zynqmp_pll_set_mode is called
       to pass IOCTL_SET_PLL_FRAC_MODE to ATF. Note that at this point
       ATF just stores the mode to a variable.
    3) This driver calls clk_prepare_enable and zynqmp_pll_enable is
       called to try to enable VPLL_INT pll. Because of 1), the function
       zynqmp_pll_enable just returns without doing anything after checking
       that this pll has been enabled.
    
    In the scenario above, the pll mode of VPLL_INT will never be set
    successfully. So adding set_pll_mode to check condition to fix it.

    [ Upstream commit b5a1f8921d5040bb788492bf33a66758021e4be5 ]
    
    There is a small race where the parent is NULL even though the kobj has
    already been made visible in sysfs.
    
    For instance the attribute_group is made visible in sysfs_create_files()
    and the mdev_type_attr_show() does:
    
        ret = attr->show(kobj, type->parent->dev, buf);
    
    Which will crash on NULL parent. Move the parent setup to before the type
    pointer leaves the stack frame.

    vfio/pci: Move VGA and VF initialization to functions
    
    [ Upstream commit 61e90817482871b614133c0f20feb1aba2faec86 ]
    
    vfio_pci_probe() is quite complicated, with optional VF and VGA sub
    components. Move these into clear init/uninit functions and have a linear
    flow in probe/remove.
    
    This fixes a few little buglets:
     - vfio_pci_remove() is in the wrong order, vga_client_register() removes
       a notifier and is after kfree(vdev), but the notifier refers to vdev,
       so it can use after free in a race.
     - vga_client_register() can fail but was ignored
    
    Organize things so destruction order is the reverse of creation order.

    vfio/fsl-mc: Re-order vfio_fsl_mc_probe()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b1fe162e584a88ec7f12a651a2a50f94dd8cfac ]
    
    vfio_add_group_dev() must be called only after all of the private data in
    vdev is fully setup and ready, otherwise there could be races with user
    space instantiating a device file descriptor and starting to call ops.
    
    For instance vfio_fsl_mc_reflck_attach() sets vdev->reflck and
    vfio_fsl_mc_open(), called by fops open, unconditionally derefs it, which
    will crash if things get out of order.
    
    This driver started life with the right sequence, but two commits added
    stuff after vfio_add_group_dev().

    media: v4l2-ctrls.c: fix race condition in hdl->requests list
    
    [ Upstream commit be7e8af98f3af729aa9f08b1053f9533a5cceb91 ]
    
    When a request is re-inited it will release all control handler
    objects that are still in the request. It does that by unbinding
    and putting all those objects. When the object is unbound the
    obj->req pointer is set to NULL, and the object's unbind op is
    called. When the object it put the object's release op is called
    to free the memory.
    
    For a request object that contains a control handler that means
    that v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() is called in the release op.
    
    A control handler used in a request has a pointer to the main
    control handler that is created by the driver and contains the
    current state of all controls. If the device is unbound (due to
    rmmod or a forced unbind), then that main handler is freed, again
    by calling v4l2_ctrl_handler_free(), and any outstanding request
    objects that refer to that main handler have to be unbound and put
    as well.
    
    It does that by this test:
    
            if (!hdl->req_obj.req && !list_empty(&hdl->requests)) {
    
    I.e. the handler has no pointer to a request, so is the main
    handler, and one or more request objects refer to this main
    handler.
    
    However, this test is wrong since hdl->req_obj.req is actually
    NULL when re-initing a request (the object unbind will set req to
    NULL), and the only reason this seemingly worked is that the
    requests list is typically empty since the request's unbind op
    will remove the handler from the requests list.
    
    But if another thread is at the same time adding a new control
    to a request, then there is a race condition where one thread
    is removing a control handler object from the requests list and
    another thread is adding one. The result is that hdl->requests
    is no longer empty and the code thinks that a main handler is
    being freed instead of a control handler that is part of a request.
    
    There are two bugs here: first the test for hdl->req_obj.req: this
    should be hdl->req_obj.ops since only the main control handler will
    have a NULL pointer there.
    
    The second is that adding or deleting request objects from the
    requests list of the main handler isn't protected by taking the
    main handler's lock.

    clk: imx: Fix reparenting of UARTs not associated with stdout
    
    [ Upstream commit 379c9a24cc239000b1dec53db02fe17a86947423 ]
    
    Most if not all i.MX SoC's call a function which enables all UARTS.
    This is a problem for users who need to re-parent the clock source,
    because any attempt to change the parent results in an busy error
    due to the fact that the clocks have been enabled already.
    
      clk: failed to reparent uart1 to sys_pll1_80m: -16
    
    Instead of pre-initializing all UARTS, scan the device tree to see
    which UART clocks are associated to stdout, and only enable those
    UART clocks if it's needed early.  This will move initialization of
    the remaining clocks until after the parenting of the clocks.
    
    When the clocks are shutdown, this mechanism will also disable any
    clocks that were pre-initialized.

    host and on the controller side have causal relationship
    and made lockdep report on this with blktests:

    selftests: fix prepending $(OUTPUT) to $(TEST_PROGS)
    
    [ Upstream commit cb4969e6f9f5ee12521aec764fa3d4bbd91bc797 ]
    
    Currently the following command produces an error message:
    
        linux# make kselftest TARGETS=bpf O=/mnt/linux-build
        # selftests: bpf: test_libbpf.sh
        # ./test_libbpf.sh: line 23: ./test_libbpf_open: No such file or directory
        # test_libbpf: failed at file test_l4lb.o
        # selftests: test_libbpf [FAILED]
    
    The error message might not affect the return code of make, therefore
    one needs to grep make output in order to detect it.
    
    This is not the only instance of the same underlying problem; any test
    with more than one element in $(TEST_PROGS) fails the same way. Another
    example:
    
        linux# make O=/mnt/linux-build TARGETS=splice kselftest
        [...]
        # ./short_splice_read.sh: 15: ./splice_read: not found
        # FAIL: /sys/module/test_module/sections/.init.text 2
        not ok 2 selftests: splice: short_splice_read.sh # exit=1
    
    The current logic prepends $(OUTPUT) only to the first member of
    $(TEST_PROGS). After that, run_one() does
    
       cd `dirname $TEST`
    
    For all tests except the first one, `dirname $TEST` is ., which means
    they cannot access the files generated in $(OUTPUT).
    
    Fix by using $(addprefix) to prepend $(OUTPUT)/ to each member of
    $(TEST_PROGS).

    x86/kprobes: Fix to check non boostable prefixes correctly
    
    [ Upstream commit 6dd3b8c9f58816a1354be39559f630cd1bd12159 ]
    
    There are 2 bugs in the can_boost() function because of using
    x86 insn decoder. Since the insn->opcode never has a prefix byte,
    it can not find CS override prefix in it. And the insn->attr is
    the attribute of the opcode, thus inat_is_address_size_prefix(
    insn->attr) always returns false.
    
    Fix those by checking each prefix bytes with for_each_insn_prefix
    loop and getting the correct attribute for each prefix byte.
    Also, this removes unlikely, because this is a slow path.

    When sun6i_video_remote_subdev() returns NULL to subdev, no error return
    code of sun6i_video_start_streaming() is assigned.
    To fix this bug, ret is assigned with -EINVAL in this case.

    media: aspeed: fix clock handling logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 3536169f8531c2c5b153921dc7d1ac9fd570cda7 ]
    
    Video engine uses eclk and vclk for its clock sources and its reset
    control is coupled with eclk so the current clock enabling sequence works
    like below.
    
     Enable eclk
     De-assert Video Engine reset
     10ms delay
     Enable vclk
    
    It introduces improper reset on the Video Engine hardware and eventually
    the hardware generates unexpected DMA memory transfers that can corrupt
    memory region in random and sporadic patterns. This issue is observed
    very rarely on some specific AST2500 SoCs but it causes a critical
    kernel panic with making a various shape of signature so it's extremely
    hard to debug. Moreover, the issue is observed even when the video
    engine is not actively used because udevd turns on the video engine
    hardware for a short time to make a query in every boot.
    
    To fix this issue, this commit changes the clock handling logic to make
    the reset de-assertion triggered after enabling both eclk and vclk. Also,
    it adds clk_unprepare call for a case when probe fails.
    
    clk: ast2600: fix reset settings for eclk and vclk
    Video engine reset setting should be coupled with eclk to match it
    with the setting for previous Aspeed SoCs which is defined in
    clk-aspeed.c since all Aspeed SoCs are sharing a single video engine
    driver. Also, reset bit 6 is defined as 'Video Engine' reset in
    datasheet so it should be de-asserted when eclk is enabled. This
    commit fixes the setting.

    When setting the source media bus code in the resizer,
    we first check that the current media bus code in the
    source is yuv encoded format. This is done by
    retrieving the data from the formats list of the isp
    entity. This cause a crash when the media bus code on the
    source is YUYV8_1_5X8 which is not supported by the isp
    entity. Instead we should test the sink format of the resizer
    which is guaranteed to be supported by the isp entity.

    sched/fair: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in load_balance()
    
    [ Upstream commit 39a2a6eb5c9b66ea7c8055026303b3aa681b49a5 ]
    
    Syzbot reported a handful of occurrences where an sd->nr_balance_failed can
    grow to much higher values than one would expect.
    
    A successful load_balance() resets it to 0; a failed one increments
    it. Once it gets to sd->cache_nice_tries + 3, this *should* trigger an
    active balance, which will either set it to sd->cache_nice_tries+1 or reset
    it to 0. However, in case the to-be-active-balanced task is not allowed to
    run on env->dst_cpu, then the increment is done without any further
    modification.
    
    This could then be repeated ad nauseam, and would explain the absurdly high
    values reported by syzbot (86, 149). VincentG noted there is value in
    letting sd->cache_nice_tries grow, so the shift itself should be
    fixed. That means preventing:
    
      """
      If the value of the right operand is negative or is greater than or equal
      to the width of the promoted left operand, the behavior is undefined.
      """
    
    Thus we need to cap the shift exponent to
      BITS_PER_TYPE(typeof(lefthand)) - 1.
    
    I had a look around for other similar cases via coccinelle:
    
      @expr@
      position pos;
      expression E1;
      expression E2;
      @@
      (
      E1 >> E2@pos
      |
      E1 >> E2@pos
      )
    
      @cst depends on expr@
      position pos;
      expression expr.E1;
      constant cst;
      @@
      (
      E1 >> cst@pos
      |
      E1 << cst@pos
      )
    
      @script:python depends on !cst@
      pos << expr.pos;
      exp << expr.E2;

      # Dirty hack to ignore constexpr
      if exp.upper() != exp:
         coccilib.report.print_report(pos[0], "Possible UB shift here")
    
    The only other match in kernel/sched is rq_clock_thermal() which employs
    sched_thermal_decay_shift, and that exponent is already capped to 10, so
    that one is fine.

    Fix it up by implementing the flag right in the MCDE

    drm/stm: Fix bus_flags handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 99e360442f223dd40fc23ae07c7a263836fd27e6 ]
    
    The drm_display_mode_to_videomode() does not populate DISPLAY_FLAGS_DE_LOW
    or DISPLAY_FLAGS_PIXDATA_NEGEDGE flags in struct videomode. Therefore, no
    matter what polarity the next bridge or display might require, these flags
    are never set, and thus the LTDC GCR_DEPOL and GCR_PCPOL bits are never set
    and the LTDC behaves as if both DISPLAY_FLAGS_PIXDATA_POSEDGE and
    DISPLAY_FLAGS_DE_HIGH were always set.
    
    The fix for this problem is taken almost verbatim from MXSFB driver. In
    case there is a bridge attached to the LTDC, the bridge might have extra
    polarity requirements, so extract bus_flags from the bridge and use them
    for LTDC configuration. Otherwise, extract bus_flags from the connector,
    which is the display.

    [ Upstream commit f1a75f4dd8edf272b6b7cdccf6ba6254ec9d15fa ]
    
    When run xrandr to change resolution on Beaglebone Black board, it will
    print the error information:
    
    root@beaglebone:~# xrandr -display :0 --output HDMI-1 --mode 720x400

    This is because there is operation sequence as below:
    
    drm_atomic_connector_commit_dpms(mode is DRM_MODE_DPMS_OFF):
        ...
        drm_atomic_helper_setup_commit <- init_completion(commit_A->flip_done)
        drm_atomic_helper_commit_tail
            tilcdc_crtc_atomic_disable
            tilcdc_plane_atomic_update <- drm_crtc_send_vblank_event in tilcdc_crtc_irq
                                          is skipped since tilcdc_crtc->enabled is 0
            tilcdc_crtc_atomic_flush   <- drm_crtc_send_vblank_event is skipped since
                                          crtc->state->event is set to be NULL in
                                          tilcdc_plane_atomic_update
    drm_mode_setcrtc:
        ...
        drm_atomic_helper_setup_commit <- init_completion(commit_B->flip_done)
        drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_dependencies
            drm_crtc_commit_wait   <- wait for commit_A->flip_done completing
    
    Just as shown above, the steps which could complete commit_A->flip_done
    are all skipped and commit_A->flip_done will never be completed. This will
    result a time-out ERROR when drm_crtc_commit_wait check the commit_A->flip_done.
    So add drm_crtc_send_vblank_event in tilcdc_crtc_atomic_disable to
    complete commit_A->flip_done.

    soc: aspeed: fix a ternary sign expansion bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ffa828534036348fa90fb3079ccc0972d202c4a ]
    
    The intent here was to return negative error codes but it actually
    returns positive values.  The problem is that type promotion with
    ternary operations is quite complicated.
    
    "ret" is an int.  "copied" is a u32.  And the snoop_file_read() function
    returns long.  What happens is that "ret" is cast to u32 and becomes
    positive then it's cast to long and it's still positive.
    
    Fix this by removing the ternary so that "ret" is type promoted directly
    to long.

    xen-blkback: fix compatibility bug with single page rings
    
    [ Upstream commit d75e7f63b7c95c527cde42efb5d410d7f961498f ]
    
    Prior to commit 4a8c31a1c6f5 ("xen/blkback: rework connect_ring() to avoid
    inconsistent xenstore 'ring-page-order' set by malicious blkfront"), the
    behaviour of xen-blkback when connecting to a frontend was:
    
    - read 'ring-page-order'
    - if not present then expect a single page ring specified by 'ring-ref'
    - else expect a ring specified by 'ring-refX' where X is between 0 and
      1 << ring-page-order
    
    This was correct behaviour, but was broken by the afforementioned commit to
    become:
    
    - read 'ring-page-order'
    - if not present then expect a single page ring (i.e. ring-page-order = 0)
    - expect a ring specified by 'ring-refX' where X is between 0 and
      1 << ring-page-order
    - if that didn't work then see if there's a single page ring specified by
      'ring-ref'
    
    This incorrect behaviour works most of the time but fails when a frontend
    that sets 'ring-page-order' is unloaded and replaced by one that does not
    because, instead of reading 'ring-ref', xen-blkback will read the stale
    'ring-ref0' left around by the previous frontend will try to map the wrong
    grant reference.
    
    This patch restores the original behaviour.

    serial: omap: fix rs485 half-duplex filtering
    
    [ Upstream commit e2a5e8448e7393e96ccde346c68764b40a52cc10 ]
    
    Data received during half-duplex transmission must be filtered.
    If the target device responds quickly, emptying the FIFO at the end of
    the transmission can erase not only the echo characters but also part of
    the response message.
    By keeping the receive interrupt enabled even during transmission, it
    allows you to filter each echo character and only in a number equal to
    those transmitted.
    The issue was generated by a target device that started responding
    240us later having received a request in communication at 115200bps.
    Sometimes, some messages received by the target were missing some of the
    first bytes.

    usb: dwc2: Fix hibernation between host and device modes.
    
    [ Upstream commit 24d209dba5a3959b2ebde7cf3ad40c8015e814cf ]
    
    When core is in hibernation in host mode and a device cable
    was connected then driver exited from device hibernation.
    However, registers saved for host mode and when exited from
    device hibernation register restore would be done for device
    register which was wrong because there was no device registers
    stored to restore.
    
    - Added dwc_handle_gpwrdn_disc_det() function which handles
      gpwrdn disconnect detect flow and exits hibernation
      without restoring the registers.
    - Updated exiting from hibernation in GPWRDN_STS_CHGINT with
      calling dwc_handle_gpwrdn_disc_det() function. Here no register
      is restored which is the solution described above.

    [ Upstream commit f5d1499ae2096d7ea301023c4cc54e427300eb0a ]
    
    Hibernation fails on a system in fips mode because md5 is used for the e820
    integrity check and is not available. Use crc32 instead.
    
    The check is intended to detect whether the E820 memory map provided
    by the firmware after cold boot unexpectedly differs from the one that
    was in use when the hibernation image was created. In this case, the
    hibernation image cannot be restored, as it may cover memory regions
    that are no longer available to the OS.
    
    A non-cryptographic checksum such as CRC-32 is sufficient to detect such
    inadvertent deviations.

    Drivers: hv: vmbus: Increase wait time for VMbus unload
    
    [ Upstream commit 77db0ec8b7764cb9b09b78066ebfd47b2c0c1909 ]
    
    When running in Azure, disks may be connected to a Linux VM with
    read/write caching enabled. If a VM panics and issues a VMbus
    UNLOAD request to Hyper-V, the response is delayed until all dirty
    data in the disk cache is flushed.  In extreme cases, this flushing
    can take 10's of seconds, depending on the disk speed and the amount
    of dirty data. If kdump is configured for the VM, the current 10 second
    timeout in vmbus_wait_for_unload() may be exceeded, and the UNLOAD
    complete message may arrive well after the kdump kernel is already
    running, causing problems.  Note that no problem occurs if kdump is
    not enabled because Hyper-V waits for the cache flush before doing
    a reboot through the BIOS/UEFI code.
    
    Fix this problem by increasing the timeout in vmbus_wait_for_unload()
    to 100 seconds. Also output periodic messages so that if anyone is
    watching the serial console, they won't think the VM is completely
    hung.

    x86/platform/uv: Fix !KEXEC build failure
    
    [ Upstream commit c2209ea55612efac75de0a58ef5f7394fae7fa0f ]
    
    When KEXEC is disabled, the UV build fails:
    
      arch/x86/platform/uv/uv_nmi.c:875:14: error: ‘uv_nmi_kexec_failed’ undeclared (first use in this function)
    
    Since uv_nmi_kexec_failed is only defined in the KEXEC_CORE #ifdef branch,
    this code cannot ever have been build tested:
    
            if (main)
                    pr_err("UV: NMI kdump: KEXEC not supported in this kernel\n");
            atomic_set(&uv_nmi_kexec_failed, 1);
    
    Nor is this use possible in uv_handle_nmi():
    
                    atomic_set(&uv_nmi_kexec_failed, 0);
    
    These bugs were introduced in this commit:
    
        d0a9964e9873: ("x86/platform/uv: Implement simple dump failover if kdump fails")
    
    Which added the uv_nmi_kexec_failed assignments to !KEXEC code, while making the
    definition KEXEC-only - apparently without testing the !KEXEC case.
    
    Instead of complicating the #ifdef maze, simplify the code by requiring X86_UV
    to depend on KEXEC_CORE. This pattern is present in other architectures as well.
    
    ( We'll remove the untested, 7 years old !KEXEC complications from the file in a
      separate commit. )

    spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: fix hang issue when suspend/resume
    
    [ Upstream commit 799f923f0a66a9c99f0a3eaa078b306db7a8b33a ]
    
    After calling platform_set_drvdata(pdev, xqspi) in probe, the return
    value of dev_get_drvdata(dev) is a pointer to struct zynqmp_qspi but
    not struct spi_controller. A wrong structure type passing to the
    functions spi_controller_suspend/resume will hang the system.
    
    And we should check the return value of spi_controller_suspend, if
    an error is returned, return it to PM subsystem to stop suspend.
    
    Also, GQSPI_EN_MASK should be written to GQSPI_EN_OFST to enable
    the spi controller in zynqmp_qspi_resume since it was disabled in
    zynqmp_qspi_suspend before.

    spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: fix clk_enable/disable imbalance issue
    
    [ Upstream commit c6bdae08012b2ca3e94f3a41ef4ca8cfe7c9ab6f ]
    
    The clks "pclk" and "ref_clk" are enabled twice during the probe. The
    first time is in the function zynqmp_qspi_probe and the second time is
    in zynqmp_qspi_setup_op which is called by devm_spi_register_controller.
    Then calling zynqmp_qspi_remove (rmmod this module) to disable these clks
    will trigger a warning as below:
    
    [  309.124604] Unpreparing enabled qspi_ref
    [  309.128641] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 537 at drivers/clk/clk.c:824 clk_core_unprepare+0x108/0x110
    
    Since pm_runtime works now, clks can be enabled/disabled by calling
    zynqmp_runtime_suspend/resume. So we don't need to enable these clks
    explicitly in zynqmp_qspi_setup_op. Remove them to fix this issue.
    
    And remove clk enabling/disabling in zynqmp_qspi_resume because there is
    no spi transfer operation so enabling ref_clk is redundant meanwhile pclk
    is not disabled for it is shared with other peripherals.
    
    Furthermore replace clk_enable/disable with clk_prepare_enable and
    clk_disable_unprepare in runtime_suspend/resume functions.

    pmc_plt_clk* clocks are used for ethernet controllers, so need to stay

    There are new affected boards that would otherwise need to be listed.
    There are unaffected boards in the family, but having the clocks

    security: keys: trusted: fix TPM2 authorizations
    
    [ Upstream commit de66514d934d70ce73c302ce0644b54970fc7196 ]
    
    In TPM 1.2 an authorization was a 20 byte number.  The spec actually
    recommended you to hash variable length passwords and use the sha1
    hash as the authorization.  Because the spec doesn't require this
    hashing, the current authorization for trusted keys is a 40 digit hex
    number.  For TPM 2.0 the spec allows the passing in of variable length
    passwords and passphrases directly, so we should allow that in trusted
    keys for ease of use.  Update the 'blobauth' parameter to take this
    into account, so we can now use plain text passwords for the keys.
    
    so before
    
    keyctl add trusted kmk "new 32 blobauth=f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258fkeyhandle=81000001" @u
    
    after we will accept both the old hex sha1 form as well as a new
    directly supplied password:
    
    keyctl add trusted kmk "new 32 blobauth=hello keyhandle=81000001" @u
    
    Since a sha1 hex code must be exactly 40 bytes long and a direct
    password must be 20 or less, we use the length as the discriminator
    for which form is input.
    
    Note this is both and enhancement and a potential bug fix.  The TPM
    2.0 spec requires us to strip leading zeros, meaning empyty
    authorization is a zero length HMAC whereas we're currently passing in
    20 bytes of zeros.  A lot of TPMs simply accept this as OK, but the
    Microsoft TPM emulator rejects it with TPM_RC_BAD_AUTH, so this patch
    makes the Microsoft TPM emulator work with trusted keys.

    tty: fix return value for unsupported termiox ioctls
    
    [ Upstream commit 8871de06ff78e9333d86c87d7071452b690e7c9b ]
    
    Drivers should return -ENOTTY ("Inappropriate I/O control operation")
    when an ioctl isn't supported, while -EINVAL is used for invalid
    arguments.
    
    Support for termiox was added by commit 1d65b4a088de ("tty: Add
    termiox") in 2008 but no driver support ever followed and it was
    recently ripped out by commit e0efb3168d34 ("tty: Remove dead termiox
    code").
    
    Fix the return value for the unsupported termiox ioctls, which have
    always returned -EINVAL, by explicitly returning -ENOTTY rather than
    removing them completely and falling back to the default unrecognised-
    ioctl handling.

    tty: Remove dead termiox code
    
    [ Upstream commit e0efb3168d34dc8c8c72718672b8902e40efff8f ]
    
    set_termiox() and the TCGETX handler bail out with -EINVAL immediately
    if ->termiox is NULL, but there are no code paths that can set
    ->termiox to a non-NULL pointer; and no such code paths seem to have
    existed since the termiox mechanism was introduced back in
    commit 1d65b4a088de ("tty: Add termiox") in v2.6.28.
    Similarly, no driver actually implements .set_termiox; and it looks like
    no driver ever has.
    
    Delete this dead code; but leave the definition of struct termiox in the
    UAPI headers intact.

    USB: cdc-acm: fix TIOCGSERIAL implementation
    
    [ Upstream commit 496960274153bdeb9d1f904ff1ea875cef8232c1 ]
    
    TIOCSSERIAL is a horrid, underspecified, legacy interface which for most
    serial devices is only useful for setting the close_delay and
    closing_wait parameters.
    
    The xmit_fifo_size parameter could be used to set the hardware transmit
    fifo size of a legacy UART when it could not be detected, but the
    interface is limited to eight bits and should be left unset when it is
    not used.
    
    Similarly, baud_base could be used to set the UART base clock when it
    could not be detected, but might as well be left unset when it is not
    known (which is the case for CDC).
    
    Fix the cdc-acm TIOCGSERIAL implementation by dropping its custom
    interpretation of the unused xmit_fifo_size and baud_base fields, which
    overflowed the former with the URB buffer size and set the latter to the
    current line speed. Also return the port line number, which is the only
    other value used besides the close parameters.
    
    Note that the current line speed can still be retrieved through the
    standard termios interfaces.

    [ Upstream commit 41d310930084502433fcb3c4baf219e7424b7734 ]
    
    When starting a read operation, we should call zynqmp_qspi_setuprxdma
    first to set xqspi->mode according to xqspi->bytes_to_receive and
    to calculate correct xqspi->dma_rx_bytes. Then in the function
    zynqmp_qspi_fillgenfifo, generate the appropriate command with
    operating mode and bytes to transfer, and fill the GENFIFO with
    the command to perform the read operation.
    
    Calling zynqmp_qspi_fillgenfifo before zynqmp_qspi_setuprxdma will
    result in incorrect transfer length and operating mode. So change
    the calling order to fix this issue.

    [ Upstream commit 8ad07d79bd56a531990a1a3f3f1c0eb19d2de806 ]
    
    There is a data corruption issue that occurs in the reading operation
    (cmd:0x6c) when transmitting common data as dummy circles.
    
    The gqspi controller has the functionality to send dummy clock circles.
    When writing data with the fields [receive, transmit, data_xfer] = [0,0,1]
    to the Generic FIFO, and configuring the correct SPI mode, the controller
    will transmit dummy circles.
    
    So let's switch to hardware dummy cycles transfer to fix this issue.

    [ Upstream commit e93033aff684641f71a436ca7a9d2a742126baaf ]
    
    When CPU frequency is at 250 MHz and set_rate() is called with 500 MHz (L1)
    quickly followed by a call with 1 GHz (L0), the CPU does not necessarily
    stay in L1 for at least 20ms as is required by Marvell errata.
    
    This situation happens frequently with the ondemand cpufreq governor and
    can be also reproduced with userspace governor. In most cases it causes CPU
    to crash.
    
    This change fixes the above issue and ensures that the CPU always stays in
    L1 for at least 20ms when switching from any state to L0.

    cpufreq: armada-37xx: Fix the AVS value for load L1
    
    [ Upstream commit d118ac2062b5b8331c8768ac81e016617e0996ee ]
    
    The original CPU voltage value for load L1 is too low for Armada 37xx SoC
    when base CPU frequency is 1000 or 1200 MHz. It leads to instabilities
    where CPU gets stuck soon after dynamic voltage scaling from load L1 to L0.
    
    Update the CPU voltage value for load L1 accordingly when base frequency is
    1000 or 1200 MHz. The minimal L1 value for base CPU frequency 1000 MHz is
    updated from the original 1.05V to 1.108V and for 1200 MHz is updated to
    1.155V. This minimal L1 value is used only in the case when it is lower
    than value for L0.
    
    This change fixes CPU instability issues on 1 GHz and 1.2 GHz variants of
    Espressobin and 1 GHz Turris Mox.
    
    Marvell previously for 1 GHz variant of Espressobin provided a patch [1]
    suitable only for their Marvell Linux kernel 4.4 fork which workarounded
    this issue. Patch forced CPU voltage value to 1.108V in all loads. But
    such change does not fix CPU instability issues on 1.2 GHz variants of
    Armada 3720 SoC.
    
    During testing we come to the conclusion that using 1.108V as minimal
    value for L1 load makes 1 GHz variants of Espressobin and Turris Mox boards
    stable. And similarly 1.155V for 1.2 GHz variant of Espressobin.
    
    These two values 1.108V and 1.155V are documented in Armada 3700 Hardware
    Specifications as typical initial CPU voltage values.
    
    Discussion about this issue is also at the Armbian forum [2].

    [ Upstream commit 4e435a9dd26c46ac018997cc0562d50b1a96f372 ]
    
    Remove the .set_parent method in clk_pm_cpu_ops.
    
    This method was supposed to be needed by the armada-37xx-cpufreq driver,
    but was never actually called due to wrong assumptions in the cpufreq
    driver. After this was fixed in the cpufreq driver, this method is not
    needed anymore.

    cpufreq: armada-37xx: Fix setting TBG parent for load levels
    
    [ Upstream commit 22592df194e31baf371906cc720da38fa0ab68f5 ]
    
    With CPU frequency determining software [1] we have discovered that
    after this driver does one CPU frequency change, the base frequency of
    the CPU is set to the frequency of TBG-A-P clock, instead of the TBG
    that is parent to the CPU.
    
    This can be reproduced on EspressoBIN and Turris MOX:
      cd /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0
      echo powersave >scaling_governor
      echo performance >scaling_governor
    
    Running the mhz tool before this driver is loaded reports 1000 MHz, and
    after loading the driver and executing commands above the tool reports
    800 MHz.
    
    The change of TBG clock selector is supposed to happen in function
    armada37xx_cpufreq_dvfs_setup. Before the function returns, it does
    this:
      parent = clk_get_parent(clk);
      clk_set_parent(clk, parent);
    
    The armada-37xx-periph clock driver has the .set_parent method
    implemented correctly for this, so if the method was actually called,
    this would work. But since the introduction of the common clock
    framework in commit b2476490ef11 ("clk: introduce the common clock..."),
    the clk_set_parent function checks whether the parent is actually
    changing, and if the requested new parent is same as the old parent
    (which is obviously the case for the code above), the .set_parent method
    is not called at all.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by filling the correct TBG clock selector
    directly in the armada37xx_cpufreq_dvfs_setup during the filling of
    other registers at the same address. But the determination of CPU TBG
    index cannot be done via the common clock framework, therefore we need
    to access the North Bridge Peripheral Clock registers directly in this
    driver.

    ACPI: CPPC: Replace cppc_attr with kobj_attribute
    
    [ Upstream commit 2bc6262c6117dd18106d5aa50d53e945b5d99c51 ]
    
    All of the CPPC sysfs show functions are called via indirect call in
    kobj_attr_show(), where they should be of type
    
    ssize_t (*show)(struct kobject *kobj, struct kobj_attribute *attr, char *buf);
    
    because that is the type of the ->show() member in
    'struct kobj_attribute' but they are actually of type
    
    ssize_t (*show)(struct kobject *kobj, struct attribute *attr, char *buf);
    
    because of the ->show() member in 'struct cppc_attr', resulting in a
    Control Flow Integrity violation [1].
    
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/acpi_cppc/highest_perf
    3400
    
    $ dmesg | grep "CFI failure"
    [  175.970559] CFI failure (target: show_highest_perf+0x0/0x8):
    
    As far as I can tell, the only difference between 'struct cppc_attr'
    and 'struct kobj_attribute' aside from the type of the attr parameter
    is the type of the count parameter in the ->store() member (ssize_t vs.
    size_t), which does not actually matter because all of these nodes are
    read-only.
    
    Eliminate 'struct cppc_attr' in favor of 'struct kobj_attribute' to fix
    the violation.

    In case of error, the function device_node_to_regmap() returns
    ERR_PTR() and never returns NULL. The NULL test in the return
    value check should be replaced with IS_ERR().

    clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Add missing set_state_oneshot_stopped
    
    [ Upstream commit ac4daf737674b4d29e19b7c300caff3bcf7160d8 ]
    
    To avoid spurious timer interrupts when KTIME_MAX is used, we need to
    configure set_state_oneshot_stopped(). Although implementing this is
    optional, it still affects things like power management for the extra
    timer interrupt.
    
    For more information, please see commit 8fff52fd5093 ("clockevents:
    Introduce CLOCK_EVT_STATE_ONESHOT_STOPPED state") and commit cf8c5009ee37

    clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Fix posted mode status check order
    
    [ Upstream commit 212709926c5493a566ca4086ad4f4b0d4e66b553 ]
    
    When the timer is configured in posted mode, we need to check the write-
    posted status register (TWPS) before writing to the register.
    
    We now check TWPS after the write starting with commit 52762fbd1c47
    ("clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Add clockevent and clocksource
    support").
    
    For example, in the TRM for am571x the following is documented in chapter
    "22.2.4.13.1.1 Write Posting Synchronization Mode":
    
    "For each register, a status bit is provided in the timer write-posted
     status (TWPS) register. In this mode, it is mandatory that software check
     this status bit before any write access. If a write is attempted to a
     register with a previous access pending, the previous access is discarded
     without notice."
    
    The regression happened when I updated the code to use standard read/write
    accessors for the driver instead of using __omap_dm_timer_load_start().
    We have__omap_dm_timer_load_start() check the TWPS status correctly using
    __omap_dm_timer_write().

    [ Upstream commit 5e84a66f3682af4f177bb24bb2ad5135c51f764a ]
    
    TIOCSSERIAL is a horrid, underspecified, legacy interface which for most
    serial devices is only useful for setting the close_delay and
    closing_wait parameters.
    
    The xmit_fifo_size parameter could be used to set the hardware transmit
    fifo size of a legacy UART when it could not be detected, but the
    interface is limited to eight bits and should be left unset when not
    used.
    
    Fix the fwserial implementation by dropping its custom interpretation of
    the unused xmit_fifo_size field, which was overflowed with the driver
    FIFO size. Also leave the type and flags fields unset as these cannot be
    changed.
    
    The close_delay and closing_wait parameters returned by TIOCGSERIAL are
    specified in centiseconds. The driver does not yet support changing
    closing_wait, but let's report back the default value actually used (30
    seconds).

    If the callee gpmi_alloc_dma_buffer() failed to alloc memory for

    Then gpmi_alloc_dma_buffer() returns err and gpmi_free_dma_buffer()
    is called again to free this->auxiliary_virt in err_out. This causes
    a double free.
    
    As gpmi_free_dma_buffer() has already called in gpmi_alloc_dma_buffer's

    [ Upstream commit 194eafc9c1d49b53b59de9821fb63d423344cae3 ]
    
    Because a dependency on HAS_IOMEM and OF was added for the ADI AXI ADC
    driver, this makes the AD9467 driver have some build/dependency issues
    when OF is disabled (typically on ACPI archs like x86).
    
    This is because the selection of the AD9467 enforces the ADI_AXI_ADC symbol
    which is blocked by the OF (and potentially HAS_IOMEM) being disabled.
    
    To fix this, we make the AD9467 driver depend on the ADI_AXI_ADC symbol.
    The AD9467 driver cannot operate on it's own. It requires the ADI AXI ADC
    driver to stream data (or some similar IIO interface).
    
    So, the fix here is to make the AD9467 symbol depend on the ADI_AXI_ADC
    symbol. At some point this could become it's own subgroup of high-speed
    ADCs.

    firmware: qcom_scm: Workaround lack of "is available" call on SC7180
    
    [ Upstream commit 257f2935cbbf14b16912c635fcd8ff43345c953b ]
    
    Some SC7180 firmwares don't implement the QCOM_SCM_INFO_IS_CALL_AVAIL
    API, so we can't probe the calling convention. We detect the legacy
    calling convention on these firmwares, because the availability call
    always fails and legacy is the fallback. This leads to problems where
    the rmtfs driver fails to probe, because it tries to assign memory with
    a bad calling convention, which then leads to modem failing to load and
    all networking, even wifi, to fail. Ouch!
    
    Let's force the calling convention to be what it always is on this SoC,
    i.e. arm64. Of course, the calling convention is not the same thing as
    implementing the QCOM_SCM_INFO_IS_CALL_AVAIL API. The absence of the "is
    this call available" API from the firmware means that any call to
    __qcom_scm_is_call_available() fails. This is OK for now though because
    none of the calls that are checked for existence are implemented on
    firmware running on sc7180. If such a call needs to be checked for
    existence in the future, we presume that firmware will implement this
    API and then things will "just work".

    firmware: qcom_scm: Reduce locking section for __get_convention()
    
    [ Upstream commit f6ea568f0ddcdfad52807110ed8983e610f0e03b ]
    
    We shouldn't need to hold this spinlock here around the entire SCM call
    into the firmware and back. Instead, we should be able to query the
    firmware, potentially in parallel with other CPUs making the same
    convention detection firmware call, and then grab the lock to update the
    calling convention detected. The convention doesn't change at runtime so
    calling into firmware more than once is possibly wasteful but simpler.
    Besides, this is the slow path, not the fast path where we've already
    detected the convention used.
    
    More importantly, this allows us to add more logic here to workaround
    the case where the firmware call to check for availability isn't
    implemented in the firmware at all. In that case we can check the
    firmware node compatible string and force a calling convention.
    
    Note that we remove the 'has_queried' logic that is repeated twice. That
    could lead to the calling convention being printed multiple times to the
    kernel logs if the bool is true but __query_convention() is running on
    multiple CPUs. We also shorten the time where the lock is held, but we
    keep the lock held around the printk because it doesn't seem hugely
    important to drop it for that.

    Make __qcom_scm_is_call_available() return bool instead of int. The

    thus they think a call is available when really the check to see if the
    call is available failed to figure it out.

    m68k: mvme147,mvme16x: Don't wipe PCC timer config bits
    
    [ Upstream commit 43262178c043032e7c42d00de44c818ba05f9967 ]
    
    Don't clear the timer 1 configuration bits when clearing the interrupt flag
    and counter overflow. As Michael reported, "This results in no timer
    interrupts being delivered after the first. Initialization then hangs
    in calibrate_delay as the jiffies counter is not updated."
    
    On mvme16x, enable the timer after requesting the irq, consistent with
    mvme147.

    QFPROM controller hardware requires 1.8V min for fuse blowing.
    So, this change sets the voltage to 1.8V, required to blow the fuse
    for qfprom-efuse controller.
    
    To disable fuse blowing, we set the voltage to 0V since this may
    be a shared rail and may be able to run at a lower rate when we're

    usb: gadget: aspeed: fix dma map failure
    
    [ Upstream commit bd4d607044b961cecbf8c4c2f3bb5da4fb156993 ]
    
    Currently the virtual port_dev device is passed to DMA API, and this is
    wrong because the device passed to DMA API calls must be the actual
    hardware device performing the DMA.
    
    The patch replaces usb_gadget_map_request/usb_gadget_unmap_request APIs
    with usb_gadget_map_request_by_dev/usb_gadget_unmap_request_by_dev APIs
    so the DMA capable platform device can be passed to the DMA APIs.

       21 | void poly1305_core_setkey(struct poly1305_core_key *key, const u8 *raw_key);
    
    This is harmless in principle, as the calling conventions are the same,
    but the more specific prototype allows better type checking in the
    caller.
    
    Change the declaration to match the actual function definition.
    The poly1305_simd_init() is a bit suspicious here, as it previously
    had a 32-byte argument type, but looks like it needs to take the
    16-byte POLY1305_BLOCK_SIZE array instead.

    [ Upstream commit 00aa6e65aa04e500a11a2c91e92a11c37b9e234d ]
    
    Multiple threads or clients can submit a command to the TEE ring
    buffer. This patch helps to synchronize command submission to the
    ring.
    
    One thread shall write a command to a TEE ring buffer entry only if:
    
     - Trusted OS has notified that the TEE command for the given entry
       has been processed and driver has copied the TEE response into
       client buffer.
    
     - The command entry is empty and can be written into.
    
    After a command has been written to the TEE ring buffer, the global
    wptr (mutex protected) shall be incremented for use by next client.
    
    If PSP became unresponsive while processing TEE request from a
    client, then further command submission to queue will be disabled.

    devtmpfs: fix placement of complete() call
    
    [ Upstream commit 38f087de8947700d3b06d3d1594490e0f611c5d1 ]
    
    Calling complete() from within the __init function is wrong -
    theoretically, the init process could proceed all the way to freeing
    the init mem before the devtmpfsd thread gets to execute the return
    instruction in devtmpfs_setup().
    
    In practice, it seems to be harmless as gcc inlines devtmpfs_setup()
    into devtmpfsd(). So the calls of the __init functions init_chdir()
    etc. actually happen from devtmpfs_setup(), but the __ref on that one
    silences modpost (it's all right, because those calls happen before
    the complete()). But it does make the __init annotation of the setup
    function moot, which we'll fix in a subsequent patch.

    x86/microcode: Check for offline CPUs before requesting new microcode
    
    [ Upstream commit 7189b3c11903667808029ec9766a6e96de5012a5 ]
    
    Currently, the late microcode loading mechanism checks whether any CPUs
    are offlined, and, in such a case, aborts the load attempt.
    
    However, this must be done before the kernel caches new microcode from
    the filesystem. Otherwise, when offlined CPUs are onlined later, those
    cores are going to be updated through the CPU hotplug notifier callback
    with the new microcode, while CPUs previously onine will continue to run
    with the older microcode.
    
    For example:
    
    Turn off one core (2 threads):
    
      echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/online
      echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
    
    Install the ucode fails because a primary SMT thread is offline:
    
      cp intel-ucode/06-8e-09 /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/
      echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/microcode/reload
      bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
    
    Turn the core back on
    
      echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/online
      echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
      cat /proc/cpuinfo |grep microcode
      microcode : 0x30
      microcode : 0xde
      microcode : 0x30
      microcode : 0xde
    
    The rationale for why the update is aborted when at least one primary
    thread is offline is because even if that thread is soft-offlined
    and idle, it will still have to participate in broadcasted MCE's
    synchronization dance or enter SMM, and in both examples it will execute
    instructions so it better have the same microcode revision as the other
    cores.

    stm32_spi_remove() accesses the driver's private data after calling
    spi_unregister_master() even though that function releases the last
    reference on the spi_master and thereby frees the private data.
    
    Fix by switching over to the new devm_spi_alloc_master() helper which
    keeps the private data accessible until the driver has unbound.

    spi: stm32: drop devres version of spi_register_master
    
    [ Upstream commit 8d559a64f00b59af9cc02b803ff52f6e6880a651 ]
    
    A call to spi_unregister_master() triggers calling remove()
    for all the spi devices binded to the spi master.
    
    Some spi device driver requires to "talk" with the spi device
    during the remove(), e.g.:
    - a LCD panel like drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-lg-lg4573.c
      will turn off the backlighting sending a command over spi.
    This implies that the spi master must be fully functional when
    spi_unregister_master() is called, either if it is called
    explicitly in the master's remove() code or implicitly by the
    devres framework.
    
    Devres calls devres_release_all() to release all the resources
    "after" the remove() of the spi master driver (check code of
    __device_release_driver() in drivers/base/dd.c).
    If the spi master driver has an empty remove() then there would
    be no issue; the devres_release_all() will release everything
    in reverse order w.r.t. probe().
    But if code in spi master driver remove() disables the spi or
    makes it not functional (like in this spi-stm32), then devres
    cannot be used safely for unregistering the spi master and the
    binded spi devices.
    
    Replace devm_spi_register_master() with spi_register_master()
    and add spi_unregister_master() as first action in remove().

    [ Upstream commit 55fbb9ba4f06cb6aff32daca1e1910173c13ec51 ]
    
    In qcom_probe_nand_devices() function, the error code returned by
    qcom_nand_host_init_and_register() is converted to -ENODEV in the case
    of failure. This poses issue if -EPROBE_DEFER is returned when the
    dependency is not available for a component like parser.
    
    So let's restructure the error handling logic a bit and return the
    actual error code in case of qcom_nand_host_init_and_register() failure.

    mtd: Handle possible -EPROBE_DEFER from parse_mtd_partitions()
    
    [ Upstream commit 08608adb520e51403be7592c2214846fa440a23a ]
    
    There are chances that the parse_mtd_partitions() function will return
    -EPROBE_DEFER in mtd_device_parse_register(). This might happen when
    the dependency is not available for the parser. For instance, on SDX55
    the MTD_QCOMSMEM_PARTS parser depends on the QCOM_SMEM driver to parse
    the partitions defined in the shared memory region. With the current
    flow, the error returned from parse_mtd_partitions() will be discarded
    in favor of trying to add the fallback partition.
    
    This will prevent the driver to end up in probe deferred pool and the
    partitions won't be parsed even after the QCOM_SMEM driver is available.
    
    Fix this issue by bailing out of mtd_device_parse_register() when
    -EPROBE_DEFER error is returned from parse_mtd_partitions() function and
    propagate the error code to the driver core for probing later.

    [ Upstream commit 19c234a14eafca78e0bc14ffb8be3891096ce147 ]
    
    While interpreting CC_STATUS, ROLE_CONTROL has to be read to make
    sure that CC1/CC2 is not forced presenting Rp/Rd.
    
    >From the TCPCI spec:
    
    4.4.5.2 ROLE_CONTROL (Normative):
    The TCPM shall write B6 (DRP) = 0b and B3..0 (CC1/CC2) if it wishes
    to control the Rp/Rd directly instead of having the TCPC perform
    DRP toggling autonomously. When controlling Rp/Rd directly, the
    TCPM writes to B3..0 (CC1/CC2) each time it wishes to change the
    CC1/CC2 values. This control is used for TCPM-TCPC implementing
    Source or Sink only as well as when a connection has been detected
    via DRP toggling but the TCPM wishes to attempt Try.Src or Try.Snk.
    
    Table 4-22. CC_STATUS Register Definition:
    If (ROLE_CONTROL.CC1 = Rd) or ConnectResult=1)
    00b: SNK.Open (Below maximum vRa)
    01b: SNK.Default (Above minimum vRd-Connect)
    10b: SNK.Power1.5 (Above minimum vRd-Connect) Detects Rp-1.5A

    If (ROLE_CONTROL.CC2=Rd) or (ConnectResult=1)

    serial: stm32: fix wake-up flag handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 12761869f0efa524348e2ae31827fd52eebf3f0d ]
    
    This patch fixes several issue with wake-up handling:
    - the WUF irq is handled several times at wake-up
    - the USART is disabled / enabled at suspend to set wake-up flag.
    It can cause glitches during RX.
    
    This patch fix those issues:
    - clear wake-up flag and disable wake-up irq in WUF irq handling
    - enable wake-up from low power on start bit detection at port
    configuration
    - Unmask the wake-up flag irq at suspend and mask it at resume
    
    In addition, pm_wakeup_event handling is moved from receice_chars to WUF
    irq handling.

    serial: stm32: fix a deadlock condition with wakeup event
    
    [ Upstream commit ad7676812437a00a4c6be155fc17926069f99084 ]
    
    Deadlock issue is seen when enabling CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=Y, and uart
    console as wakeup source. Deadlock occurs when resuming from low power
    mode if system is waked up via usart console.
    The deadlock is triggered 100% when also disabling console suspend prior
    to go to suspend.
    
    Simplified call stack, deadlock condition:
    - stm32_console_write <-- spin_lock already held
    - print_circular_bug
    - pm_wakeup_dev_event <-- triggers lockdep as seen above
    - stm32_receive_chars
    - stm32_interrupt <-- wakeup via uart console, takes the lock
    
    So, revisit spin_lock in stm32-usart driver:
    - there is no need to hold the lock to access ICR (atomic clear of status
      flags)
    - only hold the lock inside stm32_receive_chars() routine (no need to
      call pm_wakeup_dev_event with lock held)
    - keep stm32_transmit_chars() routine called with lock held

    TX and RX FIFO thresholds may be cleared after suspend/resume, depending
    on the low power mode.
    
    Those configurations (done in startup) are not effective for UART console,
    as:
    - the reference manual indicates that FIFOEN bit can only be written when
      the USART is disabled (UE=0)
    - a set_termios (where UE is set) is requested firstly for console
      enabling, before the startup.

    This driver casts away the constness of struct stm32_usart_info that is
    pointed to by the of match table. Use of_device_get_match_data() instead
    of of_match_device() here and push the const throughout the code so that
    we don't cast away const. This nicely avoids referencing the match table
    when it is undefined with configurations where CONFIG_OF=n and fixes the
    const issues.

    [ Upstream commit 87fd0741d6dcf63ebdb14050c2b921ae14c7f307 ]
    
    The probe and remove orders are wrong as the uart_port is registered
    before saving device data in the probe, and unregistered after DMA
    resource deallocation in the remove. uart_port registering should be
    done at the end of probe and unregistering should be done at the begin of
    remove to avoid resource allocation issues.
    
    Fix probe and remove orders. This enforce resource allocation occur at
    proper time.
    Terminate both DMA rx and tx transfers before removing device.
    
    Move pm_runtime after uart_remove_one_port() call in remove() to keep the

    After the commit 7320915c8861 ("mmc: Set PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS
    for drivers that existed in v4.14"), the order of /dev/mmcblkN
    was not fixed in some SoCs which have multiple sdhi controllers.
    So, we were hard to use an sdhi device as rootfs by using
    the kernel parameter like "root=/dev/mmcblkNpM".
    
    According to the discussion on a mainling list [1], we can add
    mmc aliases to fix the issue. So, add such aliases into Renesas
    arm64 board dts files. Notes that mmc0 is an eMMC channel if
    available.

    ARM: dts: exynos: correct MUIC interrupt trigger level on Midas family
    
    [ Upstream commit 15107e443ab8c6cb35eff10438993e4bc944d9ae ]
    
    The Maxim MUIC datasheets describe the interrupt line as active low
    with a requirement of acknowledge from the CPU.  Without specifying the
    interrupt type in Devicetree, kernel might apply some fixed
    configuration, not necessarily working for this hardware.
    
    Additionally, the interrupt line is shared so using level sensitive
    interrupt is here especially important to avoid races.

    commit 0d95f41ebde40d552bb4fea64b1d618607915fd6 upstream.
    
    Adding the destroy_workqueue call in i3c_master_register introduced below
    kernel warning because it makes duplicate destroy_workqueue calls when
    i3c_master_register fails after allocating the workqueue. The workqueue will
    be destroyed by i3c_masterdev_release which is called by put_device at the
    end of the i3c_master_register function eventually in failure cases so the
    workqueue doesn't need to be destroyed in i3c_master_register.

    commit 85d703746154cdc6794b6654b587b0b0354c97e9 upstream.
    
    On vcpu reset, we expect all the registers to be brought back
    to their initial state, which happens to be a bunch of zeroes.
    
    However, some recent commit broke this, and is now leaving a bunch
    of registers (such as the FP state) with whatever was left by the
    guest. My bad.

    KVM: Stop looking for coalesced MMIO zones if the bus is destroyed
    
    commit 5d3c4c79384af06e3c8e25b7770b6247496b4417 upstream.
    
    Abort the walk of coalesced MMIO zones if kvm_io_bus_unregister_dev()
    fails to allocate memory for the new instance of the bus.  If it can't
    instantiate a new bus, unregister_dev() destroys all devices _except_ the
    target device.   But, it doesn't tell the caller that it obliterated the
    bus and invoked the destructor for all devices that were on the bus.  In
    the coalesced MMIO case, this can result in a deleted list entry
    dereference due to attempting to continue iterating on coalesced_zones
    after future entries (in the walk) have been deleted.
    
    Opportunistically add curly braces to the for-loop, which encompasses
    many lines but sneaks by without braces due to the guts being a single
    if statement.

    commit 2ee3757424be7c1cd1d0bbfa6db29a7edd82a250 upstream.
    
    If allocating a new instance of an I/O bus fails when unregistering a
    device, wait to destroy the device until after all readers are guaranteed
    to see the new null bus.  Destroying devices before the bus is nullified
    could lead to use-after-free since readers expect the devices on their
    reference of the bus to remain valid.

    When reading the base address of the a REDIST region
    through KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST we expect the
    redistributor region list to be populated with a single
    element.
    
    However list_first_entry() expects the list to be non empty.
    Instead we should use list_first_entry_or_null which effectively
    returns NULL if the list is empty.

    KVM: nVMX: Defer the MMU reload to the normal path on an EPTP switch
    
    commit c805f5d5585ab5e0cdac6b1ccf7086eb120fb7db upstream.
    
    Defer reloading the MMU after a EPTP successful EPTP switch.  The VMFUNC
    instruction itself is executed in the previous EPTP context, any side
    effects, e.g. updating RIP, should occur in the old context.  Practically
    speaking, this bug is benign as VMX doesn't touch the MMU when skipping
    an emulated instruction, nor does queuing a single-step #DB.  No other
    post-switch side effects exist.

    commit 8727906fde6ea665b52e68ddc58833772537f40a upstream.
    
    Reject KVM_SEV_INIT and KVM_SEV_ES_INIT if they are attempted after one
    or more vCPUs have been created.  KVM assumes a VM is tagged SEV/SEV-ES
    prior to vCPU creation, e.g. init_vmcb() needs to mark the VMCB as SEV
    enabled, and svm_create_vcpu() needs to allocate the VMSA.  At best,
    creating vCPUs before SEV/SEV-ES init will lead to unexpected errors
    and/or behavior, and at worst it will crash the host, e.g.
    sev_launch_update_vmsa() will dereference a null svm->vmsa pointer.

    KVM: x86/mmu: Alloc page for PDPTEs when shadowing 32-bit NPT with 64-bit
    
    commit 04d45551a1eefbea42655da52f56e846c0af721a upstream.
    
    Allocate the so called pae_root page on-demand, along with the lm_root
    page, when shadowing 32-bit NPT with 64-bit NPT, i.e. when running a
    32-bit L1.  KVM currently only allocates the page when NPT is disabled,
    or when L0 is 32-bit (using PAE paging).
    
    Note, there is an existing memory leak involving the MMU roots, as KVM
    fails to free the PAE roots on failure.  This will be addressed in a
    future commit.
    
    Fixes: ee6268ba3a68 ("KVM: x86: Skip pae_root shadow allocation if tdp enabled")
    Fixes: b6b80c78af83 ("KVM: x86/mmu: Allocate PAE root array when using SVM's 32-bit NPT")

    KVM: s390: extend kvm_s390_shadow_fault to return entry pointer
    
    commit 5ac14bac08ae827b619f21bcceaaac3b8c497e31 upstream.
    
    Extend kvm_s390_shadow_fault to return the pointer to the valid leaf
    DAT table entry, or to the invalid entry.
    
    Also return some flags in the lower bits of the address:
    PEI_DAT_PROT: indicates that DAT protection applies because of the
                  protection bit in the segment (or, if EDAT, region) tables.
    PEI_NOT_PTE: indicates that the address of the DAT table entry returned
                 does not refer to a PTE, but to a segment or region table.

    commit c5d1f6b531e68888cbe6718b3f77a60115d58b9c upstream.
    
    A new function _kvm_s390_real_to_abs will apply prefixing to a real address
    with a given prefix value.
    
    The old kvm_s390_real_to_abs becomes now a wrapper around the new function.

    s390: fix detection of vector enhancements facility 1 vs. vector packed decimal facility
    
    commit b208108638c4bd3215792415944467c36f5dfd97 upstream.
    
    The PoP documents:
            134: The vector packed decimal facility is installed in the
                 z/Architecture architectural mode. When bit 134 is
                 one, bit 129 is also one.
            135: The vector enhancements facility 1 is installed in
                 the z/Architecture architectural mode. When bit 135
                 is one, bit 129 is also one.
    
    Looks like we confuse the vector enhancements facility 1 ("EXT") with the
    Vector packed decimal facility ("BCD"). Let's fix the facility checks.
    
    Detected while working on QEMU/tcg z14 support and only unlocking
    the vector enhancements facility 1, but not the vector packed decimal
    facility.

    KVM: s390: fix guarded storage control register handling
    
    commit 44bada28219031f9e8e86b84460606efa57b871e upstream.
    
    store_regs_fmt2() has an ordering problem: first the guarded storage
    facility is enabled on the local cpu, then preemption disabled, and
    then the STGSC (store guarded storage controls) instruction is
    executed.
    
    If the process gets scheduled away between enabling the guarded
    storage facility and before preemption is disabled, this might lead to
    a special operation exception and therefore kernel crash as soon as
    the process is scheduled back and the STGSC instruction is executed.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix speaker amp on HP Envy AiO 32
    
    commit 622464c893142f7beac89f5ba8c9773bca5e5004 upstream.
    
    HP Envy AiO 32-a12xxx has an external amp that is controlled via GPIO
    bit 0x04.  However, unlike other devices, this amp seems to shut down
    itself after the certain period, hence the OS needs to up/down the bit
    dynamically only during the actual playback.
    
    This patch adds the control of the GPIO bit via the existing pcm_hook
    mechanism.  Ideally it should be triggered at the actual stream start,
    but we have only the state change at prepare/cleanup, so use those for
    switching the GPIO bit on/off.  This should be good enough for the
    purpose, and was actually confirmed to work fine.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: ALC285 Thinkpad jack pin quirk is unreachable
    
    commit 266fd994b2b0ab7ba3e5541868838ce30775964b upstream.
    
    In 9bbb94e57df1 ("ALSA: hda/realtek: fix static noise on ALC285 Lenovo
    laptops") an existing Lenovo quirk was made more generic by removing a
    0x12 pin requirement from the entry. This made the second chance table
    Thinkpad jack entry unreachable as the pin configurations became
    identical.
    
    Revert the 0x12 pin requirement removal and move Thinkpad jack pin quirk
    back to the primary pin table as they can co-exist when more specific
    configurations come first.
    
    Add a more targeted pin quirk for Lenovo devices that have 0x12 as
    0x40000000.
    
    Tested on Yoga 6 (AMD) laptop.

    commit defce244b01ee12534910a4544e11be5eb927d25 upstream.
    
    The quirk entry for Uniwill ECS M31EI is with the PCI SSID device 0,
    which means matching with all.  That is, it's essentially equivalent
    with SND_PCI_QUIRK_VENDOR(0x1584), which also matches with the
    previous entry for Haier W18 applying the very same quirk.
    
    Let's unify them with the single vendor-quirk entry.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Re-order ALC269 HP quirk table entries
    
    commit 45461e3b554c75ddff9703539f3711cc3dfb0422 upstream.
    
    Just re-order the alc269_fixup_tbl[] entries for HP devices for
    avoiding the oversight of the duplicated or unapplied item in future.
    No functional changes.
    
    Formerly, some entries were grouped for the actual codec, but this
    doesn't seem reasonable to keep in that way.  So now we simply keep
    the PCI SSID order for the whole.

    Starting with Vega the hardware supports concurrent flushes
    of VMID which can be used to implement per process VMID
    allocation.
    
    But concurrent flushes are mutual exclusive with back to

    drm/amd/display: Reject non-zero src_y and src_x for video planes
    
    commit d89f6048bdcb6a56abb396c584747d5eeae650db upstream.
    
    [Why]
    This hasn't been well tested and leads to complete system hangs on DCN1
    based systems, possibly others.
    
    The system hang can be reproduced by gesturing the video on the YouTube
    Android app on ChromeOS into full screen.
    
    [How]
    Reject atomic commits with non-zero drm_plane_state.src_x or src_y values.
    
    v2:
     - Add code comment describing the reason we're rejecting non-zero
       src_x and src_y
     - Drop gerrit Change-Id
     - Add stable CC

    drm: bridge/panel: Cleanup connector on bridge detach
    
    commit 4d906839d321c2efbf3fed4bc31ffd9ff55b75c0 upstream.
    
    If we don't call drm_connector_cleanup() manually in
    panel_bridge_detach(), the connector will be cleaned up with the other
    DRM objects in the call to drm_mode_config_cleanup(). However, since our
    drm_connector is devm-allocated, by the time drm_mode_config_cleanup()
    will be called, our connector will be long gone. Therefore, the
    connector must be cleaned up when the bridge is detached to avoid
    use-after-free conditions.
    
    v2: Cleanup connector only if it was created
    
    v3: Add FIXME
    
    v4: (Use connector->dev) directly in if() block

    commit 4ceb06e7c336f4a8d3f3b6ac9a4fea2e9c97dc07 upstream.
    
    BXT/APL has different isr/irr/hpd regs compared with other GEN9. If not
    setting these regs bits correctly according to the emulated monitor
    (currently a DP on PORT_B), although gvt still triggers a virtual HPD
    event, the guest driver won't detect a valid HPD pulse thus no full
    display detection will be executed to read the updated EDID.
    
    With this patch, the vfio_edid is enabled again on BXT/APL, which is
    previously disabled.

    Program display related vregs to proper value at initialization, setup

    vGPU virtual display vregs inherit the value from pregs. The virtual DP
    monitor is always setup on PORT_B for BXT/APL. However the host may
    connect monitor on other PORT or without any monitor connected. Without
    properly setup PIPE/DDI/PLL related vregs, guest driver may not setup
    the virutal display as expected, and the guest desktop may not be
    created.
    Since only one virtual display is supported, enable PIPE_A only. And

    FDDI: defxx: Make MMIO the configuration default except for EISA
    
    commit 193ced4a79599352d63cb8c9e2f0c6043106eb6a upstream.
    
    Recent versions of the PCI Express specification have deprecated support
    for I/O transactions and actually some PCIe host bridges, such as Power
    Systems Host Bridge 4 (PHB4), do not implement them.
    
    The default kernel configuration choice for the defxx driver is the use
    of I/O ports rather than MMIO for PCI and EISA systems.  It may have
    made sense as a conservative backwards compatible choice back when MMIO
    operation support was added to the driver as a part of TURBOchannel bus
    support.  However nowadays this configuration choice makes the driver
    unusable with systems that do not implement I/O transactions for PCIe.
    
    Make DEFXX_MMIO the configuration default then, except where configured
    for EISA.  This exception is because an EISA adapter can have its MMIO
    decoding disabled with ECU (EISA Configuration Utility) and therefore
    not available with the resource allocation infrastructure we implement,
    while port I/O is always readily available as it uses slot-specific
    addressing, directly mapped to the slot an option card has been placed
    in and handled with our EISA bus support core.  Conversely a kernel that
    supports modern systems which may not have I/O transactions implemented
    for PCIe will usually not be expected to handle legacy EISA systems.
    
    The change of the default will make it easier for people, including but
    not limited to distribution packagers, to make a working choice for the
    driver.
    
    Update the option description accordingly and while at it replace the
    potentially ambiguous PIO acronym with IOP for "port I/O" vs "I/O ports"
    according to our nomenclature used elsewhere.

    commit 2ff25985ea9ccc6c9af2c77b0b49045adcc62e0e upstream.
    
    Using a kernel with the Undefined Behaviour Sanity Checker (UBSAN) enabled, the
    following array overrun is logged:

    ================================================================================
    
    The statement where an array is being overrun is shown in the following snippet:
    
            if (rate <= DESC_RATE11M)
                    tx_power = pwr_idx_2g->cck_base[group];
            else
    ====>           tx_power = pwr_idx_2g->bw40_base[group];
    
    The associated arrays are defined in main.h as follows:
    
    struct rtw_2g_txpwr_idx {
            u8 cck_base[6];
            u8 bw40_base[5];
            struct rtw_2g_1s_pwr_idx_diff ht_1s_diff;
            struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_2s_diff;
            struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_3s_diff;
            struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_4s_diff;
    };
    
    The problem arises because the value of group is 5 for channel 14. The trivial
    increase in the dimension of bw40_base fails as this struct must match the layout of
    efuse. The fix is to add the rate as an argument to rtw_get_channel_group() and set
    the group for channel 14 to 4 if rate <= DESC_RATE11M.

    commit 010bfbe768f7ecc876ffba92db30432de4997e2a upstream.
    
    If we overflow the maximum number of BSS entries and free the

    md: Fix missing unused status line of /proc/mdstat
    
    commit 7abfabaf5f805f5171d133ce6af9b65ab766e76a upstream.
    
    Reading /proc/mdstat with a read buffer size that would not
    fit the unused status line in the first read will skip this
    line from the output.
    
    So 'dd if=/proc/mdstat bs=64 2>/dev/null' will not print something
    like: unused devices: <none>
    
    Don't return NULL immediately in start() for v=2 but call
    show() once to print the status line also for multiple reads.

    md: md_open returns -EBUSY when entering racing area
    
    commit 6a4db2a60306eb65bfb14ccc9fde035b74a4b4e7 upstream.
    
    commit d3374825ce57 ("md: make devices disappear when they are no longer
    needed.") introduced protection between mddev creating & removing. The
    md_open shouldn't create mddev when all_mddevs list doesn't contain
    mddev. With currently code logic, there will be very easy to trigger
    soft lockup in non-preempt env.
    
    This patch changes md_open returning from -ERESTARTSYS to -EBUSY, which
    will break the infinitely retry when md_open enter racing area.
    
    This patch is partly fix soft lockup issue, full fix needs mddev_find
    is split into two functions: mddev_find & mddev_find_or_alloc. And
    md_open should call new mddev_find (it only does searching job).
    
    For more detail, please refer with Christoph's "split mddev_find" patch
    in later commits.
    
    *** env ***
    kvm-qemu VM 2C1G with 2 iscsi luns
    kernel should be non-preempt
    
    *** script ***
    
    about trigger every time with below script
    
    ```
    1  node1="mdcluster1"
    2  node2="mdcluster2"
    3
    4  mdadm -Ss
    5  ssh ${node2} "mdadm -Ss"
    6  wipefs -a /dev/sda /dev/sdb
    7  mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -b clustered -e 1.2 -n 2 -l mirror /dev/sda \
       /dev/sdb --assume-clean
    8
    9  for i in {1..10}; do
    10    echo ==== $i ====;
    11
    12    echo "test  ...."
    13    ssh ${node2} "mdadm -A /dev/md0 /dev/sda /dev/sdb"
    14    sleep 1
    15
    16    echo "clean  ....."
    17    ssh ${node2} "mdadm -Ss"
    18 done
    ```
    
    I use mdcluster env to trigger soft lockup, but it isn't mdcluster
    speical bug. To stop md array in mdcluster env will do more jobs than
    non-cluster array, which will leave enough time/gap to allow kernel to
    run md_open.

    *** rootcause ***
    
    "mdadm -A" (or other array assemble commands) will start a daemon "mdadm
    --monitor" by default. When "mdadm -Ss" is running, the stop action will
    wakeup "mdadm --monitor". The "--monitor" daemon will immediately get
    info from /proc/mdstat. This time mddev in kernel still exist, so
    /proc/mdstat still show md device, which makes "mdadm --monitor" to open
    /dev/md0.
    
    The previously "mdadm -Ss" is removing action, the "mdadm --monitor"
    open action will trigger md_open which is creating action. Racing is
    happening.
    
    ```
    <thread 1>: "mdadm -Ss"
    md_release
      mddev_put deletes mddev from all_mddevs
      queue_work for mddev_delayed_delete
      at this time, "/dev/md0" is still available for opening
    
    <thread 2>: "mdadm --monitor ..."
    md_open
     + mddev_find can't find mddev of /dev/md0, and create a new mddev and
     |    return.
     + trigger "if (mddev->gendisk != bdev->bd_disk)" and return
          -ERESTARTSYS.
    ```
    
    In non-preempt kernel, <thread 2> is occupying on current CPU. and
    mddev_delayed_delete which was created in <thread 1> also can't be
    schedule.
    
    In preempt kernel, it can also trigger above racing. But kernel doesn't
    allow one thread running on a CPU all the time. after <thread 2> running
    some time, the later "mdadm -A" (refer above script line 13) will call
    md_alloc to alloc a new gendisk for mddev. it will break md_open
    statement "if (mddev->gendisk != bdev->bd_disk)" and return 0 to caller,
    the soft lockup is broken.

    md: split mddev_find
    
    commit 65aa97c4d2bfd76677c211b9d03ef05a98c6d68e upstream.
    
    Split mddev_find into a simple mddev_find that just finds an existing
    mddev by the unit number, and a more complicated mddev_find that deals
    with find or allocating a mddev.
    
    This turns out to fix this bug reported by Zhao Heming.

    md/bitmap: wait for external bitmap writes to complete during tear down
    
    commit 404a8ef512587b2460107d3272c17a89aef75edf upstream.

    bio in the above stack is a bitmap write whose completion is invoked after
    the tear down sequence sets the mddev structure to NULL in rdev.
    
    During tear down, there is an attempt to flush the bitmap writes, but for
    external bitmaps, there is no explicit wait for all the bitmap writes to
    complete. For instance, md_bitmap_flush() is called to flush the bitmap
    writes, but the last call to md_bitmap_daemon_work() in md_bitmap_flush()
    could generate new bitmap writes for which there is no explicit wait to
    complete those writes. The call to md_bitmap_update_sb() will return
    simply for external bitmaps and the follow-up call to md_update_sb() is
    conditional and may not get called for external bitmaps. This results in a
    kernel panic when the completion routine, super_written() is called which
    tries to reference mddev in the rdev that has been set to
    NULL(in unbind_rdev_from_array() by tear down sequence).
    
    The solution is to call md_super_wait() for external bitmaps after the
    last call to md_bitmap_daemon_work() in md_bitmap_flush() to ensure there
    are no pending bitmap writes before proceeding with the tear down.

    async_xor: increase src_offs when dropping destination page
    
    commit ceaf2966ab082bbc4d26516f97b3ca8a676e2af8 upstream.
    
    Now we support sharing one page if PAGE_SIZE is not equal stripe size. To
    support this, it needs to support calculating xor value with different
    offsets for each r5dev. One offset array is used to record those offsets.
    
    In RMW mode, parity page is used as a source page. It sets
    ASYNC_TX_XOR_DROP_DST before calculating xor value in ops_run_prexor5.
    So it needs to add src_list and src_offs at the same time. Now it only
    needs src_list. So the xor value which is calculated is wrong. It can
    cause data corruption problem.
    
    I can reproduce this problem 100% on a POWER8 machine. The steps are:
    
      mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -l5 -n3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 --size=3G
      mkfs.xfs /dev/md0
      mount /dev/md0 /mnt/test
      mount: /mnt/test: mount(2) system call failed: Structure needs cleaning.

    x86, sched: Treat Intel SNC topology as default, COD as exception
    
    commit 2c88d45edbb89029c1190bb3b136d2602f057c98 upstream.
    
    Commit 1340ccfa9a9a ("x86,sched: Allow topologies where NUMA nodes
    share an LLC") added a vendor and model specific check to never
    call topology_sane() for Intel Skylake Server systems where NUMA
    nodes share an LLC.
    
    Intel Ice Lake and Sapphire Rapids CPUs also enumerate an LLC that is
    shared by multiple NUMA nodes. The LLC on these CPUs is shared for
    off-package data access but private to the NUMA node for on-package
    access. Rather than managing a list of allowable SNC topologies, make
    this SNC topology the default, and treat Intel's Cluster-On-Die (COD)
    topology as the exception.
    
    In SNC mode, Sky Lake, Ice Lake, and Sapphire Rapids servers do not
    emit this warning:
    
    sched: CPU #3's llc-sibling CPU #0 is not on the same node! [node: 1 != 0]. Ignoring dependency.

    selinux: add proper NULL termination to the secclass_map permissions
    
    commit e4c82eafb609c2badc56f4e11bc50fcf44b8e9eb upstream.
    
    This patch adds the missing NULL termination to the "bpf" and
    "perf_event" object class permission lists.
    
    This missing NULL termination should really only affect the tools
    under scripts/selinux, with the most important being genheaders.c,
    although in practice this has not been an issue on any of my dev/test
    systems.  If the problem were to manifest itself it would likely
    result in bogus permissions added to the end of the object class;
    thankfully with no access control checks using these bogus
    permissions and no policies defining these permissions the impact
    would likely be limited to some noise about undefined permissions
    during policy load.

    Invoke wiz_init() before configuring anything else in Sierra/Torrent
    (invoked as part of of_platform_device_create()). wiz_init() resets the
    SERDES device and any configuration done in the probe() of
    Sierra/Torrent will be lost. In order to prevent SERDES configuration
    from getting reset, invoke wiz_init() immediately before invoking
    of_platform_device_create().

    misc: lis3lv02d: Fix false-positive WARN on various HP models
    
    commit 3641762c1c9c7cfd84a7061a0a73054f09b412e3 upstream.
    
    Before this commit lis3lv02d_get_pwron_wait() had a WARN_ONCE() to catch
    a potential divide by 0. WARN macros should only be used to catch internal
    kernel bugs and that is not the case here. We have been receiving a lot of
    bug reports about kernel backtraces caused by this WARN.
    
    The div value being checked comes from the lis3->odrs[] array. Which
    is sized to be a power-of-2 matching the number of bits in lis3->odr_mask.
    
    The only lis3 model where this array is not entirely filled with non zero
    values. IOW the only model where we can hit the div == 0 check is the
    3dc ("8 bits 3DC sensor") model:
    
    int lis3_3dc_rates[16] = {0, 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 1600, 5000};
    
    Note the 0 value at index 0, according to the datasheet an odr index of 0
    means "Power-down mode". HP typically uses a lis3 accelerometer for HDD
    fall protection. What I believe is happening here is that on newer
    HP devices, which only contain a SDD, the BIOS is leaving the lis3 device
    powered-down since it is not used for HDD fall protection.
    
    Note that the lis3_3dc_rates array initializer only specifies 10 values,
    which matches the datasheet. So it also contains 6 zero values at the end.
    
    Replace the WARN with a normal check, which treats an odr index of 0
    as power-down and uses a normal dev_err() to report the error in case
    odr index point past the initialized part of the array.

    sc16is7xx: Defer probe if device read fails
    
    commit 158e800e0fde91014812f5cdfb92ce812e3a33b4 upstream.
    
    A test was added to the probe function to ensure the device was
    actually connected and working before successfully completing a
    probe.  If the device was actually there, but the I2C bus was not
    ready yet for whatever reason, the probe fails permanently.
    
    Change the probe so that we defer the probe on a regmap read
    failure so that we try the probe again when the dependent drivers
    are potentially loaded.  This should not affect the case where the
    device truly isn't present because the probe will never successfully
    complete.

    On VMX, this is a benign bug as VMX doesn't touch the MMU when skipping

    PCI: Allow VPD access for QLogic ISP2722
    
    commit e00dc69b5f17c444a38cd9745a0f76bc989b3af4 upstream.
    
    0d5370d1d852 ("PCI: Prevent VPD access for QLogic ISP2722") disabled access
    to VPD of the ISP2722-based 16/32Gb Fibre Channel to PCIe Adapter because
    reading past the end of the VPD caused NMIs.
    
    104daa71b396 ("PCI: Determine actual VPD size on first access") limits
    reads to the actual size of VPD, which should prevent these NMIs.
    
    104daa71b396 was merged *before* 0d5370d1d852, but we think the testing
    that prompted 0d5370d1d852 ("PCI: Prevent VPD access for QLogic ISP2722")
    was done with a kernel that lacked 104daa71b396.  See [1, 2].
    
    Remove the quirk added by 0d5370d1d852 ("PCI: Prevent VPD access for QLogic
    ISP2722") so customers can read the HBA VPD.

    FDDI: defxx: Bail out gracefully with unassigned PCI resource for CSR
    
    commit f626ca682912fab55dff15469ce893ae16b65c7e upstream.
    
    Recent versions of the PCI Express specification have deprecated support
    for I/O transactions and actually some PCIe host bridges, such as Power
    Systems Host Bridge 4 (PHB4), do not implement them.
    
    For those systems the PCI BARs that request a mapping in the I/O space
    have the length recorded in the corresponding PCI resource set to zero,
    which makes it unassigned:
    
    # lspci -s 0031:02:04.0 -v
    0031:02:04.0 FDDI network controller: Digital Equipment Corporation PCI-to-PDQ Interface Chip [PFI] FDDI (DEFPA) (rev 02)
            Subsystem: Digital Equipment Corporation FDDIcontroller/PCI (DEFPA)
            Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 136, IRQ 57, NUMA node 8
            Memory at 620c080020000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128]
            I/O ports at <unassigned> [disabled]
            Memory at 620c080030000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]
            Capabilities: [50] Power Management version 2
            Kernel driver in use: defxx
            Kernel modules: defxx
    
    #
    
    Regardless the driver goes ahead and requests it (here observed with a
    Raptor Talos II POWER9 system), resulting in an odd /proc/ioport entry:
    
    # cat /proc/ioports
    00000000-ffffffffffffffff : 0031:02:04.0
    #
    
    Furthermore, the system gets confused as the driver actually continues
    and pokes at those locations, causing a flood of messages being output
    to the system console by the underlying system firmware, like:
    
    defxx: v1.11 2014/07/01  Lawrence V. Stefani and others
    defxx 0031:02:04.0: enabling device (0140 -> 0142)
    LPC[000]: Got SYNC no-response error. Error address reg: 0xd0010000
    IPMI: dropping non severe PEL event
    LPC[000]: Got SYNC no-response error. Error address reg: 0xd0010014
    IPMI: dropping non severe PEL event
    LPC[000]: Got SYNC no-response error. Error address reg: 0xd0010014
    IPMI: dropping non severe PEL event
    
    and so on and so on (possibly intermixed actually, as there's no locking
    between the kernel and the firmware in console port access with this
    particular system, but cleaned up above for clarity), and once some 10k
    of such pairs of the latter two messages have been produced an interace
    eventually shows up in a useless state:
    
    0031:02:04.0: DEFPA at I/O addr = 0x0, IRQ = 57, Hardware addr = 00-00-00-00-00-00
    
    This was not expected to happen as resource handling was added to the
    driver a while ago, because it was not known at that time that a PCI
    system would be possible that cannot assign port I/O resources, and
    oddly enough `request_region' does not fail, which would have caught it.
    
    Correct the problem then by checking for the length of zero for the CSR
    resource and bail out gracefully refusing to register an interface if
    that turns out to be the case, producing messages like:
    
    defxx: v1.11 2014/07/01  Lawrence V. Stefani and others
    0031:02:04.0: Cannot use I/O, no address set, aborting
    0031:02:04.0: Recompile driver with "CONFIG_DEFXX_MMIO=y"
    
    Keep the original check for the EISA MMIO resource as implemented,
    because in that case the length is hardwired to 0x400 as a consequence
    of how the compare/mask address decoding works in the ESIC chip and it
    is only the base address that is set to zero if MMIO has been disabled
    for the adapter in EISA configuration, which in turn could be a valid
    bus address in a legacy-free system implementing PCI, especially for
    port I/O.
    
    Where the EISA MMIO resource has been disabled for the adapter in EISA
    configuration this arrangement keeps producing messages like:
    
    eisa 00:05: EISA: slot 5: DEC3002 detected
    defxx: v1.11 2014/07/01  Lawrence V. Stefani and others
    00:05: Cannot use MMIO, no address set, aborting
    00:05: Recompile driver with "CONFIG_DEFXX_MMIO=n"
    00:05: Or run ECU and set adapter's MMIO location
    
    with the last two lines now swapped for easier handling in the driver.
    
    There is no need to check for and catch the case of a port I/O resource
    not having been assigned for EISA as the adapter uses the slot-specific
    I/O space, which gets assigned by how EISA has been specified and maps
    directly to the particular slot an option card has been placed in.  And
    the EISA variant of the adapter has additional registers that are only
    accessible via the port I/O space anyway.
    
    While at it factor out the error message calls into helpers and fix an
    argument order bug with the `pr_err' call now in `dfx_register_res_err'.

    MIPS: pci-rt2880: fix slot 0 configuration
    
    commit 8e98b697006d749d745d3b174168a877bb96c500 upstream.
    
    pci_fixup_irqs() used to call pcibios_map_irq on every PCI device, which
    for RT2880 included bus 0 slot 0. After pci_fixup_irqs() got removed,
    only slots/funcs with devices attached would be called. While arguably
    the right thing, that left no chance for this driver to ever initialize
    slot 0, effectively bricking PCI and USB on RT2880 devices such as the
    Belkin F5D8235-4 v1.
    
    Slot 0 configuration needs to happen after PCI bus enumeration, but
    before any device at slot 0x11 (func 0 or 1) is talked to. That was
    determined empirically by testing on a Belkin F5D8235-4 v1 device. A
    minimal BAR 0 config write followed by read, then setting slot 0
    PCI_COMMAND to MASTER | IO | MEMORY is all that seems to be required for
    proper functionality.
    
    Tested by ensuring that full- and high-speed USB devices get enumerated
    on the Belkin F5D8235-4 v1 (with an out of tree DTS file from OpenWrt).

    MIPS: pci-mt7620: fix PLL lock check
    
    commit c15b99ae2ba9ea30da3c7cd4765b8a4707e530a6 upstream.
    
    Upstream a long-standing OpenWrt patch [0] that fixes MT7620 PCIe PLL
    lock check. The existing code checks the wrong register bit: PPLL_SW_SET
    is not defined in PPLL_CFG1 and bit 31 of PPLL_CFG1 is marked as reserved
    in the MT7620 Programming Guide. The correct bit to check for PLL lock
    is PPLL_LD (bit 23).
    
    Also reword the error message for clarity.
    
    Without this change it is unlikely that this driver ever worked with
    mainline kernel.

    commit 1ca1156cfd69530e6b7cb99943baf90c8bd871a5 upstream.
    
    Clock registration must be performed before the component is
    registered.  aic32x4_component_probe attempts to get all the
    clocks right off the bat.  If the component is registered before
    the clocks there is a race condition where the clocks may not

    ASoC: Intel: kbl_da7219_max98927: Fix kabylake_ssp_fixup function
    
    commit a523ef731ac6674dc07574f31bf44cc5bfa14e4d upstream.
    
    kabylake_ssp_fixup function uses snd_soc_dpcm to identify the
    codecs DAIs. The HW parameters are changed based on the codec DAI of the
    stream. The earlier approach to get snd_soc_dpcm was using container_of()
    macro on snd_pcm_hw_params.
    
    The structures have been modified over time and snd_soc_dpcm does not have
    snd_pcm_hw_params as a reference but as a copy. This causes the current
    driver to crash when used.
    
    This patch changes the way snd_soc_dpcm is extracted. snd_soc_pcm_runtime
    holds 2 dpcm instances (one for playback and one for capture). 2 codecs
    on the SSP are dmic (capture) and speakers (playback). Based on the
    stream direction, snd_soc_dpcm is extracted from snd_soc_pcm_runtime.
    
    Tested for all use cases of the driver.

    usb: roles: Call try_module_get() from usb_role_switch_find_by_fwnode()
    
    commit 3a2a91a2d51761557843996a66098eb7182b48b4 upstream.
    
    usb_role_switch_find_by_fwnode() returns a reference to the role-switch
    which must be put by calling usb_role_switch_put().
    
    usb_role_switch_put() calls module_put(sw->dev.parent->driver->owner),
    add a matching try_module_get() to usb_role_switch_find_by_fwnode(),
    making it behave the same as the other usb_role_switch functions
    which return a reference.
    
    This avoids a WARN_ON being hit at kernel/module.c:1158 due to the
    module-refcount going below 0.

    Revert "USB: cdc-acm: fix rounding error in TIOCSSERIAL"
    
    commit 729f7955cb987c5b7d7e54c87c5ad71c789934f7 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit b401f8c4f492cbf74f3f59c9141e5be3071071bb.
    
    The offending commit claimed that trying to set the values reported back
    by TIOCGSERIAL as a regular user could result in an -EPERM error when HZ
    is 250, but that was never the case.
    
    With HZ=250, the default 0.5 second value of close_delay is converted to
    125 jiffies when set and is converted back to 50 centiseconds by
    TIOCGSERIAL as expected (not 12 cs as was claimed, even if that was the
    case before an earlier fix).
    
    Comparing the internal current and new jiffies values is just fine to
    determine if the value is about to change so drop the bogus workaround
    (which was also backported to stable).
    
    For completeness: With different default values for these parameters or
    with a HZ value not divisible by two, the lack of rounding when setting
    the default values in tty_port_init() could result in an -EPERM being
    returned, but this is hardly something we need to worry about.

    io_uring: truncate lengths larger than MAX_RW_COUNT on provide buffers
    
    commit d1f82808877bb10d3deee7cf3374a4eb3fb582db upstream.
    
    Read and write operations are capped to MAX_RW_COUNT. Some read ops rely on
    that limit, and that is not guaranteed by the IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS.
    
    Truncate those lengths when doing io_add_buffers, so buffer addresses still
    use the uncapped length.
    
    Also, take the chance and change struct io_buffer len member to __u32, so
    it matches struct io_provide_buffer len member.
    
    This fixes CVE-2021-3491, also reported as ZDI-CAN-13546.

    net/nfc: fix use-after-free llcp_sock_bind/connect
    
    commit c61760e6940dd4039a7f5e84a6afc9cdbf4d82b6 upstream.
    
    Commits 8a4cd82d ("nfc: fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect()")
    and c33b1cc62 ("nfc: fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind()")
    fixed a refcount leak bug in bind/connect but introduced a
    use-after-free if the same local is assigned to 2 different sockets.
    
    This can be triggered by the following simple program:
        int sock1 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP );
        int sock2 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP );
        memset( &addr, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) );
        addr.sa_family = AF_NFC;
        addr.nfc_protocol = NFC_PROTO_NFC_DEP;
        bind( sock1, (struct sockaddr*) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) )
        bind( sock2, (struct sockaddr*) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) )
        close(sock1);
        close(sock2);
    
    Fix this by assigning NULL to llcp_sock->local after calling
    nfc_llcp_local_put.
    
    This addresses CVE-2021-23134.

    bluetooth: eliminate the potential race condition when removing the HCI controller
    
    commit e2cb6b891ad2b8caa9131e3be70f45243df82a80 upstream.
    
    There is a possible race condition vulnerability between issuing a HCI
    command and removing the cont.  Specifically, functions hci_req_sync()
    and hci_dev_do_close() can race each other like below:
    
    thread-A in hci_req_sync()      |   thread-B in hci_dev_do_close()
                                    |   hci_req_sync_lock(hdev);
    test_bit(HCI_UP, &hdev->flags); |
    ...                             |   test_and_clear_bit(HCI_UP, &hdev->flags)
    hci_req_sync_lock(hdev);        |
                                    |
    In this commit we alter the sequence in function hci_req_sync(). Hence,
    the thread-A cannot issue th.

    Bluetooth: verify AMP hci_chan before amp_destroy
    
    commit 5c4c8c9544099bb9043a10a5318130a943e32fc3 upstream.
    
    hci_chan can be created in 2 places: hci_loglink_complete_evt() if
    it is an AMP hci_chan, or l2cap_conn_add() otherwise. In theory,
    Only AMP hci_chan should be removed by a call to
    hci_disconn_loglink_complete_evt(). However, the controller might mess
    up, call that function, and destroy an hci_chan which is not initiated
    by hci_loglink_complete_evt().
    
    This patch adds a verification that the destroyed hci_chan must have
    been init'd by hci_loglink_complete_evt().
