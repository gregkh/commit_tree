    serial: 8250: Add Quark X1000 to 8250_pci.c
    
    commit 1ede7dcca3c4fa15a518ab0473126f9c3e621e4c upstream.
    
    Quark X1000 contains two designware derived 8250 serial ports.
    Each port has a unique PCI configuration space consisting of
    BAR0:UART BAR1:DMA respectively.
    
    Unlike the standard 8250 the register width is 32 bits for RHR,IER etc
    The Quark UART has a fundamental clock @ 44.2368 MHz allowing for a
    bitrate of up to about 2.76 megabits per second.
    
    This patch enables standard 8250 mode

    if we don't make sure to kill the timer, it could

    That will trigger a Data Abort exception because

    USB: Add device quirk for ASUS T100 Base Station keyboard
    
    commit ddbe1fca0bcb87ca8c199ea873a456ca8a948567 upstream.
    
    This full-speed USB device generates spurious remote wakeup event
    as soon as USB_DEVICE_REMOTE_WAKEUP feature is set. As the result,
    Linux can't enter system suspend and S0ix power saving modes once
    this keyboard is used.
    
    This patch tries to introduce USB_QUIRK_IGNORE_REMOTE_WAKEUP quirk.
    With this quirk set, wakeup capability will be ignored during
    device configure.

    sctp: handle association restarts when the socket is closed.
    
    [ Upstream commit bdf6fa52f01b941d4a80372d56de465bdbbd1d23 ]
    
    Currently association restarts do not take into consideration the
    state of the socket.  When a restart happens, the current assocation
    simply transitions into established state.  This creates a condition
    where a remote system, through a the restart procedure, may create a
    local association that is no way reachable by user.  The conditions
    to trigger this are as follows:
      1) Remote does not acknoledge some data causing data to remain
         outstanding.
      2) Local application calls close() on the socket.  Since data
         is still outstanding, the association is placed in SHUTDOWN_PENDING
         state.  However, the socket is closed.
      3) The remote tries to create a new association, triggering a restart
         on the local system.  The association moves from SHUTDOWN_PENDING
         to ESTABLISHED.  At this point, it is no longer reachable by
         any socket on the local system.
    
    This patch addresses the above situation by moving the newly ESTABLISHED
    association into SHUTDOWN-SENT state and bundling a SHUTDOWN after
    the COOKIE-ACK chunk.  This way, the restarted associate immidiately
    enters the shutdown procedure and forces the termination of the
    unreachable association.

    team: avoid race condition in scheduling delayed work
    
    [ Upstream commit 47549650abd13d873fd2e5fc218db19e21031074 ]
    
    When team_notify_peers and team_mcast_rejoin are called, they both reset
    their respective .count_pending atomic variable. Then when the actual
    worker function is executed, the variable is atomically decremented.
    This pattern introduces a potential race condition where the
    .count_pending rolls over and the worker function keeps rescheduling
    until .count_pending decrements to zero again:
    
    THREAD 1                           THREAD 2
    
    ========                           ========
    team_notify_peers(teamX)
      atomic_set count_pending = 1
      schedule_delayed_work
                                       team_notify_peers(teamX)
                                       atomic_set count_pending = 1
    team_notify_peers_work
      atomic_dec_and_test
        count_pending = 0
      (return)
                                       schedule_delayed_work
                                       team_notify_peers_work
                                       atomic_dec_and_test
                                         count_pending = -1
                                       schedule_delayed_work
                                       (repeat until count_pending = 0)
    
    Instead of assigning a new value to .count_pending, use atomic_add to
    tack-on the additional desired worker function invocations.

    In commit 8a29111c7ca6 ("net: gro: allow to build full sized skb")
    I added a regression for linear skb that traditionally force GRO
    to use the frag_list fallback.
    
    Erez Shitrit found that at most two segments were aggregated and
    the "if (skb_gro_len(p) != pinfo->gso_size)" test was failing.
    
    This is because pinfo at this spot still points to the last skb in the
    chain, instead of the first one, where we find the correct gso_size
    information.

    macvtap: Fix race between device delete and open.
    
    [ Upstream commit 40b8fe45d1f094e3babe7b2dc2b71557ab71401d ]
    
    In macvtap device delete and open calls can race and
    this causes a list curruption of the vlan queue_list.
    
    The race intself is triggered by the idr accessors
    that located the vlan device.  The device is stored
    into and removed from the idr under both an rtnl and
    a mutex.  However, when attempting to locate the device
    in idr, only a mutex is taken.  As a result, once cpu
    perfoming a delete may take an rtnl and wait for the mutex,
    while another cput doing an open() will take the idr
    mutex first to fetch the device pointer and later take
    an rtnl to add a queue for the device which may have
    just gotten deleted.
    
    With this patch, we now hold the rtnl for the duration
    of the macvtap_open() call thus making sure that
    open will not race with delete.

    [ Upstream commit 7d3083ee36b51e425b6abd76778a2046906b0fd3 ]
    
    When receiving a vlan-tagged frame that still contains
    a vlan header, the length of the packet will be greater
    then MTU+ETH_HLEN since it will account of the extra
    vlan header.  TG3 checks this for the case for 802.1Q,
    but not for 802.1ad.  As a result, full sized 802.1ad
    frames get dropped by the card.
    
    Add a check for 802.1ad protocol when receving full
    sized frames.

    The problem seems to be that commit f9399814927a ("bonding: Don't allow
    bond devices to change network namespaces.") sets NETIF_F_NETNS_LOCAL
    on bonding interfaces, and commit 797f87f83b60 ("macvlan: fix netdev
    feature propagation from lower device") causes macvlan interfaces
    to inherit its features from the lower device.
    
    NETIF_F_NETNS_LOCAL should not be inherited from the lower device
    by a macvlan.
    Patch tested on 3.16.

    bridge: Fix br_should_learn to check vlan_enabled
    
    [ Upstream commit c095f248e63ada504dd90c90baae673ae10ee3fe ]
    
    As Toshiaki Makita pointed out, the BRIDGE_INPUT_SKB_CB will
    not be initialized in br_should_learn() as that function
    is called only from br_handle_local_finish().  That is
    an input handler for link-local ethernet traffic so it perfectly
    correct to check br->vlan_enabled here.

    bridge: Check if vlan filtering is enabled only once.
    
    [ Upstream commit 20adfa1a81af00bf2027644507ad4fa9cd2849cf ]
    
    The bridge code checks if vlan filtering is enabled on both
    ingress and egress.   When the state flip happens, it
    is possible for the bridge to currently be forwarding packets
    and forwarding behavior becomes non-deterministic.  Bridge
    may drop packets on some interfaces, but not others.
    
    This patch solves this by caching the filtered state of the
    packet into skb_cb on ingress.  The skb_cb is guaranteed to
    not be over-written between the time packet entres bridge
    forwarding path and the time it leaves it.  On egress, we
    can then check the cached state to see if we need to
    apply filtering information.

    ipv6: restore the behavior of ipv6_sock_ac_drop()
    
    [ Upstream commit de185ab46cb02df9738b0d898b0c3a89181c5526 ]
    
    It is possible that the interface is already gone after joining
    the list of anycast on this interface as we don't hold a refcount
    for the device, in this case we are safe to ignore the error.
    
    What's more important, for API compatibility we should not
    change this behavior for applications even if it were correct.

    bonding: fix div by zero while enslaving and transmitting
    
    [ Upstream commit 9a72c2da690d78e93cff24b9f616412508678dd5 ]
    
    The problem is that the slave is first linked and slave_cnt is
    incremented afterwards leading to a div by zero in the modes that use it
    as a modulus. What happens is that in bond_start_xmit()
    bond_has_slaves() is used to evaluate further transmission and it becomes
    true after the slave is linked in, but when slave_cnt is used in the xmit
    path it is still 0, so fetch it once and transmit based on that. Since
    it is used only in round-robin and XOR modes, the fix is only for them.
    Thanks to Eric Dumazet for pointing out the fault in my first try to fix
    this.

    ipv6: fix rtnl locking in setsockopt for anycast and multicast
    
    [ Upstream commit a9ed4a2986e13011fcf4ed2d1a1647c53112f55b ]
    
    Calling setsockopt with IPV6_JOIN_ANYCAST or IPV6_LEAVE_ANYCAST
    triggers the assertion in addrconf_join_solict()/addrconf_leave_solict()
    
    ipv6_sock_ac_join(), ipv6_sock_ac_drop(), ipv6_sock_ac_close() need to
    take RTNL before calling ipv6_dev_ac_inc/dec. Same thing with
    ipv6_sock_mc_join(), ipv6_sock_mc_drop(), ipv6_sock_mc_close() before
    calling ipv6_dev_mc_inc/dec.
    
    This patch moves ASSERT_RTNL() up a level in the call stack.

    l2tp: fix race while getting PMTU on PPP pseudo-wire

    Use dst_entry held by sk_dst_get() to retrieve tunnel's PMTU.
    
    The dst_mtu(__sk_dst_get(tunnel->sock)) call was racy. __sk_dst_get()
    could return NULL if tunnel->sock->sk_dst_cache was reset just before the
    call, thus making dst_mtu() dereference a NULL pointer:

    vxlan: fix incorrect initializer in union vxlan_addr
    
    [ Upstream commit a45e92a599e77ee6a850eabdd0141633fde03915 ]
    
    The first initializer in the following
    
            union vxlan_addr ipa = {
                .sin.sin_addr.s_addr = tip,
                .sa.sa_family = AF_INET,
            };
    
    is optimised away by the compiler, due to the second initializer,
    therefore initialising .sin.sin_addr.s_addr always to 0.
    This results in netlink messages indicating a L3 miss never contain the
    missed IP address. This was observed with GCC 4.8 and 4.9. I do not know about previous versions.
    The problem affects user space programs relying on an IP address being
    sent as part of a netlink message indicating a L3 miss.
    
    Changing
                .sa.sa_family = AF_INET,
    to
                .sin.sin_family = AF_INET,
    fixes the problem.

    openvswitch: fix panic with multiple vlan headers
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ba5af42a7b59ef01f9081234d8855140738defd ]
    
    When there are multiple vlan headers present in a received frame, the first
    one is put into vlan_tci and protocol is set to ETH_P_8021Q. Anything in the
    skb beyond the VLAN TPID may be still non-linear, including the inner TCI
    and ethertype. While ovs_flow_extract takes care of IP and IPv6 headers, it
    does nothing with ETH_P_8021Q. Later, if OVS_ACTION_ATTR_POP_VLAN is
    executed, __pop_vlan_tci pulls the next vlan header into vlan_tci.
    
    This leads to two things:
    
    1. Part of the resulting ethernet header is in the non-linear part of the
       skb. When eth_type_trans is called later as the result of
       OVS_ACTION_ATTR_OUTPUT, kernel BUGs in __skb_pull. Also, __pop_vlan_tci
       is in fact accessing random data when it reads past the TPID.
    
    2. network_header points into the ethernet header instead of behind it.
       mac_len is set to a wrong value (10), too.

    tcp: fix ssthresh and undo for consecutive short FRTO episodes
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c9ab09223fe9922baeb22546c9a90d774a4bde6 ]
    
    Fix TCP FRTO logic so that it always notices when snd_una advances,
    indicating that any RTO after that point will be a new and distinct
    loss episode.
    
    Previously there was a very specific sequence that could cause FRTO to
    fail to notice a new loss episode had started:
    
    (1) RTO timer fires, enter FRTO and retransmit packet 1 in write queue
    (2) receiver ACKs packet 1
    (3) FRTO sends 2 more packets
    (4) RTO timer fires again (should start a new loss episode)
    
    The problem was in step (3) above, where tcp_process_loss() returned
    early (in the spot marked "Step 2.b"), so that it never got to the
    logic to clear icsk_retransmits. Thus icsk_retransmits stayed
    non-zero. Thus in step (4) tcp_enter_loss() would see the non-zero
    icsk_retransmits, decide that this RTO is not a new episode, and
    decide not to cut ssthresh and remember the current cwnd and ssthresh
    for undo.
    
    There were two main consequences to the bug that we have
    observed. First, ssthresh was not decreased in step (4). Second, when
    there was a series of such FRTO (1-4) sequences that happened to be
    followed by an FRTO undo, we would restore the cwnd and ssthresh from
    before the entire series started (instead of the cwnd and ssthresh
    from before the most recent RTO). This could result in cwnd and
    ssthresh being restored to values much bigger than the proper values.

    sit: Fix ipip6_tunnel_lookup device matching criteria
    
    [ Upstream commit bc8fc7b8f825ef17a0fb9e68c18ce94fa66ab337 ]
    
    As of 4fddbf5d78 ("sit: strictly restrict incoming traffic to tunnel link device"),
    when looking up a tunnel, tunnel's underlying interface (t->parms.link)
    is verified to match incoming traffic's ingress device.
    
    However the comparison was incorrectly based on skb->dev->iflink.
    
    Instead, dev->ifindex should be used, which correctly represents the
    interface from which the IP stack hands the ipip6 packets.
    
    This allows setting up sit tunnels bound to vlan interfaces (otherwise
    incoming ipip6 traffic on the vlan interface was dropped due to
    ipip6_tunnel_lookup match failure).

    should be queued up for stable 3.14 & 3.15 since the i40e driver will
    not load when DCB is enabled, unless this patch is applied.
    
    In case of any AQ command to query port's DCB configuration fails
    during driver's probe time; the probe fails and returns an error.
    
    This patch prevents this issue by continuing the driver probe even
    when an error is returned.
    
    Also, added an error message to dump the AQ error status to show what
    error caused the failure to get the DCB configuration from firmware.

    net: Always untag vlan-tagged traffic on input.
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d5501c1c828fb97d02af50aa9d2b1a5498b94e4 ]
    
    Currently the functionality to untag traffic on input resides
    as part of the vlan module and is build only when VLAN support
    is enabled in the kernel.  When VLAN is disabled, the function
    vlan_untag() turns into a stub and doesn't really untag the
    packets.  This seems to create an interesting interaction
    between VMs supporting checksum offloading and some network drivers.
    
    There are some drivers that do not allow the user to change
    tx-vlan-offload feature of the driver.  These drivers also seem
    to assume that any VLAN-tagged traffic they transmit will
    have the vlan information in the vlan_tci and not in the vlan
    header already in the skb.  When transmitting skbs that already
    have tagged data with partial checksum set, the checksum doesn't
    appear to be updated correctly by the card thus resulting in a
    failure to establish TCP connections.
    
    The following is a packet trace taken on the receiver where a
    sender is a VM with a VLAN configued.  The host VM is running on
    doest not have VLAN support and the outging interface on the
    host is tg3:
    10:12:43.503055 52:54:00:ae:42:3f > 28:d2:44:7d:c2:de, ethertype 802.1Q
    (0x8100), length 78: vlan 100, p 0, ethertype IPv4, (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 27243,

    -> 0x48d9), seq 1069378582, win 29200, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val
    4294837885 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0
    10:12:44.505556 52:54:00:ae:42:3f > 28:d2:44:7d:c2:de, ethertype 802.1Q

    4294838888 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0
    
    This connection finally times out.
    
    I've only access to the TG3 hardware in this configuration thus have
    only tested this with TG3 driver.  There are a lot of other drivers
    that do not permit user changes to vlan acceleration features, and
    I don't know if they all suffere from a similar issue.
    
    The patch attempt to fix this another way.  It moves the vlan header
    stipping code out of the vlan module and always builds it into the
    kernel network core.  This way, even if vlan is not supported on
    a virtualizatoin host, the virtual machines running on top of such
    host will still work with VLANs enabled.

    [ Upstream commit 945a36761fd7877660f630bbdeb4ff9ff80d1935 ]
    
    Commit 1d8faf48c74b8 ("net/core: Add VF link state control") added new
    attribute to IFLA_VF_INFO group in rtnl_fill_ifinfo but did not adjust size
    of the allocated memory in if_nlmsg_size/rtnl_vfinfo_size. As the result, we
    may trigger warnings in rtnl_getlink and similar functions when many VF
    links are enabled, as the information does not fit into the allocated skb.

    netlink: reset network header before passing to taps
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e48ed883c72e78c5a910f8831ffe90c9b18f0ec ]
    
    netlink doesn't set any network header offset thus when the skb is
    being passed to tap devices via dev_queue_xmit_nit(), it emits klog
    false positives due to it being unset like:
    
      ...
      [  124.990397] protocol 0000 is buggy, dev nlmon0
      [  124.990411] protocol 0000 is buggy, dev nlmon0
      ...
    
    So just reset the network header before passing to the device; for
    packet sockets that just means nothing will change - mac and net
    offset hold the same value just as before.
