    spi: bcm2835: Fix 3-wire mode if DMA is enabled
    
    commit 8d8bef50365847134b51c1ec46786bc2873e4e47 upstream.
    
    Commit 6935224da248 ("spi: bcm2835: enable support of 3-wire mode")
    added 3-wire support to the BCM2835 SPI driver by setting the REN bit
    (Read Enable) in the CS register when receiving data.  The REN bit puts
    the transmitter in high-impedance state.  The driver recognizes that
    data is to be received by checking whether the rx_buf of a transfer is
    non-NULL.
    
    Commit 3ecd37edaa2a ("spi: bcm2835: enable dma modes for transfers
    meeting certain conditions") subsequently broke 3-wire support because
    it set the SPI_MASTER_MUST_RX flag which causes spi_map_msg() to replace
    rx_buf with a dummy buffer if it is NULL.  As a result, rx_buf is
    *always* non-NULL if DMA is enabled.
    
    Reinstate 3-wire support by not only checking whether rx_buf is non-NULL,
    but also checking that it is not the dummy buffer.

    cgroup: Fix css_task_iter_advance_css_set() cset skip condition

    cgroup: css_task_iter_skip()'d iterators must be advanced before accessed
    
    commit cee0c33c546a93957a52ae9ab6bebadbee765ec5 upstream.
    
    b636fd38dc40 ("cgroup: Implement css_task_iter_skip()") introduced
    css_task_iter_skip() which is used to fix task iterations skipping
    dying threadgroup leaders with live threads.  Skipping is implemented
    as a subportion of full advancing but css_task_iter_next() forgot to
    fully advance a skipped iterator before determining the next task to
    visit causing it to return invalid task pointers.
    
    Fix it by making css_task_iter_next() fully advance the iterator if it
    has been skipped since the previous iteration.

    cgroup: Include dying leaders with live threads in PROCS iterations
    
    commit c03cd7738a83b13739f00546166969342c8ff014 upstream.
    
    CSS_TASK_ITER_PROCS currently iterates live group leaders; however,
    this means that a process with dying leader and live threads will be
    skipped.  IOW, cgroup.procs might be empty while cgroup.threads isn't,
    which is confusing to say the least.
    
    Fix it by making cset track dying tasks and include dying leaders with
    live threads in PROCS iteration.

    cgroup: Implement css_task_iter_skip()
    
    commit b636fd38dc40113f853337a7d2a6885ad23b8811 upstream.
    
    When a task is moved out of a cset, task iterators pointing to the
    task are advanced using the normal css_task_iter_advance() call.  This
    is fine but we'll be tracking dying tasks on csets and thus moving
    tasks from cset->tasks to (to be added) cset->dying_tasks.  When we
    remove a task from cset->tasks, if we advance the iterators, they may
    move over to the next cset before we had the chance to add the task
    back on the dying list, which can allow the task to escape iteration.
    
    This patch separates out skipping from advancing.  Skipping only moves
    the affected iterators to the next pointer rather than fully advancing
    it and the following advancing will recognize that the cursor has
    already been moved forward and do the rest of advancing.  This ensures
    that when a task moves from one list to another in its cset, as long
    as it moves in the right direction, it's always visible to iteration.
    
    This doesn't cause any visible behavior changes.

    cgroup: Call cgroup_release() before __exit_signal()
    
    commit 6b115bf58e6f013ca75e7115aabcbd56c20ff31d upstream.
    
    cgroup_release() calls cgroup_subsys->release() which is used by the
    pids controller to uncharge its pid.  We want to use it to manage
    iteration of dying tasks which requires putting it before
    __unhash_process().  Move cgroup_release() above __exit_signal().
    While this makes it uncharge before the pid is freed, pid is RCU freed
    anyway and the window is very narrow.

    tun: mark small packets as owned by the tap sock
    
    [ Upstream commit 4b663366246be1d1d4b1b8b01245b2e88ad9e706 ]
    
    - v1 -> v2: Move skb_set_owner_w to __tun_build_skb to reduce patch size
    
    Small packets going out of a tap device go through an optimized code
    path that uses build_skb() rather than sock_alloc_send_pskb(). The
    latter calls skb_set_owner_w(), but the small packet code path does not.
    
    The net effect is that small packets are not owned by the userland
    application's socket (e.g. QEMU), while large packets are.
    This can be seen with a TCP session, where packets are not owned when
    the window size is small enough (around PAGE_SIZE), while they are once
    the window grows (note that this requires the host to support virtio
    tso for the guest to offload segmentation).
    All this leads to inconsistent behaviour in the kernel, especially on
    netfilter modules that uses sk->socket (e.g. xt_owner).

    net/mlx5e: Prevent encap flow counter update async to user query
    
    [ Upstream commit 90bb769291161cf25a818d69cf608c181654473e ]
    
    This patch prevents a race between user invoked cached counters
    query and a neighbor last usage updater.
    
    The cached flow counter stats can be queried by calling
    "mlx5_fc_query_cached" which provides the number of bytes and
    packets that passed via this flow since the last time this counter
    was queried.
    It does so by reducting the last saved stats from the current, cached
    stats and then updating the last saved stats with the cached stats.
    It also provide the lastuse value for that flow.
    
    Since "mlx5e_tc_update_neigh_used_value" needs to retrieve the
    last usage time of encapsulation flows, it calls the flow counter
    query method periodically and async to user queries of the flow counter
    using cls_flower.
    This call is causing the driver to update the last reported bytes and
    packets from the cache and therefore, future user queries of the flow
    stats will return lower than expected number for bytes and packets
    since the last saved stats in the driver was updated async to the last
    saved stats in cls_flower.
    
    This causes wrong stats presentation of encapsulation flows to user.
    
    Since the neighbor usage updater only needs the lastuse stats from the
    cached counter, the fix is to use a dedicated lastuse query call that
    returns the lastuse value without synching between the cached stats and
    the last saved stats.

    compat_ioctl: pppoe: fix PPPOEIOCSFWD handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 055d88242a6046a1ceac3167290f054c72571cd9 ]
    
    Support for handling the PPPOEIOCSFWD ioctl in compat mode was added in
    linux-2.5.69 along with hundreds of other commands, but was always broken
    sincen only the structure is compatible, but the command number is not,
    due to the size being sizeof(size_t), or at first sizeof(sizeof((struct
    sockaddr_pppox)), which is different on 64-bit architectures.
    
    Guillaume Nault adds:
    
      And the implementation was broken until 2016 (see 29e73269aa4d ("pppoe:
      fix reference counting in PPPoE proxy")), and nobody ever noticed. I
      should probably have removed this ioctl entirely instead of fixing it.
      Clearly, it has never been used.
    
    Fix it by adding a compat_ioctl handler for all pppoe variants that
    translates the command number and then calls the regular ioctl function.
    
    All other ioctl commands handled by pppoe are compatible between 32-bit
    and 64-bit, and require compat_ptr() conversion.
    
    This should apply to all stable kernels.

    Commit 2753ca5d9009 ("tipc: fix uninit-value in tipc_nl_compat_doit")
    broke older tipc tools that use compat interface (e.g. tipc-config from
    tipcutils package):
    
    % tipc-config -p
    operation not supported
    
    The commit started to reject TIPC netlink compat messages that do not
    have attributes. It is too restrictive because some of such messages are
    valid (they don't need any arguments):
    
    % grep 'tx none' include/uapi/linux/tipc_config.h
    #define  TIPC_CMD_NOOP              0x0000    /* tx none, rx none */
    #define  TIPC_CMD_GET_MEDIA_NAMES   0x0002    /* tx none, rx media_name(s) */
    #define  TIPC_CMD_GET_BEARER_NAMES  0x0003    /* tx none, rx bearer_name(s) */
    #define  TIPC_CMD_SHOW_PORTS        0x0006    /* tx none, rx ultra_string */

    This patch relaxes the original fix and rejects messages without
    arguments only if such arguments are expected by a command (reg_type is
    non zero).

    context in hardware is removed, then remove mlx5e netdev interface which
    will cleanup the lag context from hardware.
    
    Without this fix during destroy of LAG interface, we observed following
    errors:
     * mlx5_cmd_check:752:(pid 12556): DESTROY_LAG(0x843) op_mod(0x0) failed,

    net: fix ifindex collision during namespace removal
    
    [ Upstream commit 55b40dbf0e76b4bfb9d8b3a16a0208640a9a45df ]
    
    Commit aca51397d014 ("netns: Fix arbitrary net_device-s corruptions
    on net_ns stop.") introduced a possibility to hit a BUG in case device
    is returning back to init_net and two following conditions are met:
    1) dev->ifindex value is used in a name of another "dev%d"
       device in init_net.
    2) dev->name is used by another device in init_net.
    
    Under real life circumstances this is hard to get. Therefore this has
    been present happily for over 10 years. To reproduce:

    net: bridge: mcast: don't delete permanent entries when fast leave is enabled
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c725b6b65067909548ac9ca9bc777098ec9883d ]
    
    When permanent entries were introduced by the commit below, they were
    exempt from timing out and thus igmp leave wouldn't affect them unless
    fast leave was enabled on the port which was added before permanent
    entries existed. It shouldn't matter if fast leave is enabled or not
    if the user added a permanent entry it shouldn't be deleted on igmp
    leave.
    
    Before:
    $ echo 1 > /sys/class/net/eth4/brport/multicast_fast_leave
    $ bridge mdb add dev br0 port eth4 grp 229.1.1.1 permanent
    $ bridge mdb show
    dev br0 port eth4 grp 229.1.1.1 permanent
    
    < join and leave 229.1.1.1 on eth4 >
    
    $ bridge mdb show
    $
    
    After:
    $ echo 1 > /sys/class/net/eth4/brport/multicast_fast_leave
    $ bridge mdb add dev br0 port eth4 grp 229.1.1.1 permanent
    $ bridge mdb show

    net: bridge: delete local fdb on device init failure
    
    [ Upstream commit d7bae09fa008c6c9a489580db0a5a12063b97f97 ]
    
    On initialization failure we have to delete the local fdb which was
    inserted due to the default pvid creation. This problem has been present
    since the inception of default_pvid. Note that currently there are 2 cases:
    1) in br_dev_init() when br_multicast_init() fails
    2) if register_netdevice() fails after calling ndo_init()
    
    This patch takes care of both since br_vlan_flush() is called on both
    occasions. Also the new fdb delete would be a no-op on normal bridge
    device destruction since the local fdb would've been already flushed by
    br_dev_delete(). This is not an issue for ports since nbp_vlan_init() is
    called last when adding a port thus nothing can fail after it.

    atm: iphase: Fix Spectre v1 vulnerability
    
    [ Upstream commit ea443e5e98b5b74e317ef3d26bcaea54931ccdee ]
    
    board is controlled by user-space, hence leading to a potential
    exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.
    
    This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:
    
    drivers/atm/iphase.c:2765 ia_ioctl() warn: potential spectre issue 'ia_dev' [r] (local cap)
    drivers/atm/iphase.c:2774 ia_ioctl() warn: possible spectre second half.  'iadev'

    drivers/atm/iphase.c:2823 ia_ioctl() warn: possible spectre second half.  'iadev'
    drivers/atm/iphase.c:2830 ia_ioctl() warn: potential spectre issue '_ia_dev' [r] (local cap)

    drivers/atm/iphase.c:2856 ia_ioctl() warn: possible spectre second half.  'iadev'
    
    Fix this by sanitizing board before using it to index ia_dev and _ia_dev
    
    Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
    to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
    completed with a dependent load/store [1].

    objtool noreturn list.  This fixes the following warning with clang and
    CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=y:
    
      arch/x86/kernel/reboot.o: warning: objtool: native_machine_emergency_restart() falls through to next function machine_power_off()

    IB: directly cast the sockaddr union to aockaddr
    
    Like commit 641114d2af31 ("RDMA: Directly cast the sockaddr union to
    sockaddr") we need to quiet gcc 9 from warning about this crazy union.
    That commit did not fix all of the warnings in 4.19 and older kernels
    because the logic in roce_resolve_route_from_path() was rewritten
    between 4.19 and 5.2 when that change happened.

    RDMA: Directly cast the sockaddr union to sockaddr
    
    commit 641114d2af312d39ca9bbc2369d18a5823da51c6 upstream.
    
    gcc 9 now does allocation size tracking and thinks that passing the member
    of a union and then accessing beyond that member's bounds is an overflow.
    
    Instead of using the union member, use the entire union with a cast to
    get to the sockaddr. gcc will now know that the memory extends the full
    size of the union.

    HID: Add quirk for HP X1200 PIXART OEM mouse
    
    commit 49869d2ea9eecc105a10724c1abf035151a3c4e2 upstream.
    
    The PixArt OEM mice are known for disconnecting every minute in
    runlevel 1 or 3 if they are not always polled. So add quirk
    ALWAYS_POLL for this one as well.
    
    Jonathan Teh (@jonathan-teh) reported and tested the quirk.

    arm64: cpufeature: Fix feature comparison for CTR_EL0.{CWG,ERG}
    
    commit 147b9635e6347104b91f48ca9dca61eb0fbf2a54 upstream.
    
    If CTR_EL0.{CWG,ERG} are 0b0000 then they must be interpreted to have
    their architecturally maximum values, which defeats the use of
    FTR_HIGHER_SAFE when sanitising CPU ID registers on heterogeneous
    machines.
    
    Introduce FTR_HIGHER_OR_ZERO_SAFE so that these fields effectively
    saturate at zero.

    tcp: be more careful in tcp_fragment()
    
    commit b617158dc096709d8600c53b6052144d12b89fab upstream.
    
    Some applications set tiny SO_SNDBUF values and expect
    TCP to just work. Recent patches to address CVE-2019-11478
    broke them in case of losses, since retransmits might
    be prevented.
    
    We should allow these flows to make progress.
    
    This patch allows the first and last skb in retransmit queue
    to be split even if memory limits are hit.
    
    It also adds the some room due to the fact that tcp_sendmsg()
    and tcp_sendpage() might overshoot sk_wmem_queued by about one full
    TSO skb (64KB size). Note this allowance was already present
    in stable backports for kernels < 4.15
    
    Note for < 4.15 backports :
     tcp_rtx_queue_tail() will probably look like :
    
    static inline struct sk_buff *tcp_rtx_queue_tail(const struct sock *sk)
    {
            struct sk_buff *skb = tcp_send_head(sk);
    
            return skb ? tcp_write_queue_prev(sk, skb) : tcp_write_queue_tail(sk);
    }

    scsi: fcoe: Embed fc_rport_priv in fcoe_rport structure
    
    commit 023358b136d490ca91735ac6490db3741af5a8bd upstream.
    
    Gcc-9 complains for a memset across pointer boundaries, which happens as
    the code tries to allocate a flexible array on the stack.  Turns out we
    cannot do this without relying on gcc-isms, so with this patch we'll embed
    the fc_rport_priv structure into fcoe_rport, can use the normal
    'container_of' outcast, and will only have to do a memset over one
    structure.
