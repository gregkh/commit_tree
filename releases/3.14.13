    ACPI / battery: Retry to get battery information if failed during probing
    
    commit 75646e758a0ecbed5024454507d5be5b9ea9dcbf upstream.
    
    Some machines (eg. Lenovo Z480) ECs are not stable during boot up
    and causes battery driver fails to be loaded due to failure of getting
    battery information from EC sometimes. After several retries, the
    operation will work. This patch is to retry to get battery information 5
    times if the first try fails.

    introduced by the commit 9e50bc14a7f58b5d8a55973b2d69355852ae2dae (ACPI /

    x86, ioremap: Speed up check for RAM pages
    
    commit c81c8a1eeede61e92a15103748c23d100880cc8a upstream.
    
    In __ioremap_caller() (the guts of ioremap), we loop over the range of
    pfns being remapped and checks each one individually with page_is_ram().
    For large ioremaps, this can be very slow.  For example, we have a
    device with a 256 GiB PCI BAR, and ioremapping this BAR can take 20+
    seconds -- sometimes long enough to trigger the soft lockup detector!
    
    Internally, page_is_ram() calls walk_system_ram_range() on a single
    page.  Instead, we can make a single call to walk_system_ram_range()
    from __ioremap_caller(), and do our further checks only for any RAM
    pages that we find.  For the common case of MMIO, this saves an enormous
    amount of work, since the range being ioremapped doesn't intersect
    system RAM at all.
    
    With this change, ioremap on our 256 GiB BAR takes less than 1 second.

    powerpc: Disable RELOCATABLE for COMPILE_TEST with PPC64
    
    commit fb43e8477ed9006c4f397f904c691a120503038c upstream.
    
    powerpc:allmodconfig has been failing for some time with the following
    error.
    
    arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S: Assembler messages:
    arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S:1312: Error: attempt to move .org backwards
    make[1]: *** [arch/powerpc/kernel/head_64.o] Error 1
    
    A number of attempts to fix the problem by moving around code have been
    unsuccessful and resulted in failed builds for some configurations and
    the discovery of toolchain bugs.
    
    Fix the problem by disabling RELOCATABLE for COMPILE_TEST builds instead.
    While this is less than perfect, it avoids substantial code changes
    which would otherwise be necessary just to make COMPILE_TEST builds
    happy and might have undesired side effects.

    ring-buffer: Check if buffer exists before polling
    
    commit 8b8b36834d0fff67fc8668093f4312dd04dcf21d upstream.
    
    The per_cpu buffers are created one per possible CPU. But these do
    not mean that those CPUs are online, nor do they even exist.
    
    With the addition of the ring buffer polling, it assumes that the
    caller polls on an existing buffer. But this is not the case if
    the user reads trace_pipe from a CPU that does not exist, and this
    causes the kernel to crash.
    
    Simple fix is to check the cpu against buffer bitmask against to see
    if the buffer was allocated or not and return -ENODEV if it is
    not.
    
    More updates were done to pass the -ENODEV back up to userspace.

    drm/radeon: stop poisoning the GART TLB
    
    commit 0986c1a55ca64b44ee126a2f719a6e9f28cbe0ed upstream.
    
    When we set the valid bit on invalid GART entries they are
    loaded into the TLB when an adjacent entry is loaded. This
    poisons the TLB with invalid entries which are sometimes
    not correctly removed on TLB flush.
    
    For stable inclusion the patch probably needs to be modified a bit.

    ext4: fix unjournalled bg descriptor while initializing inode bitmap
    
    commit 61c219f5814277ecb71d64cb30297028d6665979 upstream.
    
    The first time that we allocate from an uninitialized inode allocation
    bitmap, if the block allocation bitmap is also uninitalized, we need
    to get write access to the block group descriptor before we start
    modifying the block group descriptor flags and updating the free block
    count, etc.  Otherwise, there is the potential of a bad journal
    checksum (if journal checksums are enabled), and of the file system
    becoming inconsistent if we crash at exactly the wrong time.

    PCI: Fix unaligned access in AF transaction pending test
    
    commit d066c946a866268c14a120b33e7226e899981998 upstream.
    
    pci_wait_for_pending() uses word access, so we shouldn't be passing
    an offset that is only byte aligned.  Use the control register offset
    instead, shifting the mask to match.

    intel_pstate: Set CPU number before accessing MSRs
    
    commit 179e8471673ce0249cd4ecda796008f7757e5bad upstream.
    
    Ensure that cpu->cpu is set before writing MSR_IA32_PERF_CTL during CPU
    initialization. Otherwise only cpu0 has its P-state set and all other
    cores are left with their values unchanged.
    
    In most cases, this is not too serious because the P-states will be set
    correctly when the timer function is run.  But when the default governor
    is set to performance, the per-CPU current_pstate stays the same forever
    and no attempts are made to write the MSRs again.

    intel_pstate: don't touch turbo bit if turbo disabled or unavailable.
    
    commit dd5fbf70f96dbfd7ee432096a1f979b2b3267856 upstream.
    
    If turbo is disabled in the BIOS bit 38 should be set in
    MSR_IA32_MISC_ENABLE register per section 14.3.2.1 of the SDM Vol 3
    document 325384-050US Feb 2014.  If this bit is set do *not* attempt
    to disable trubo via the MSR_IA32_PERF_CTL register.  On some systems
    trying to disable turbo via MSR_IA32_PERF_CTL will cause subsequent
    writes to MSR_IA32_PERF_CTL not take affect, in fact reading
    MSR_IA32_PERF_CTL will not show the IDA/Turbo DISENGAGE bit(32) as
    set. A write of bit 32 to zero returns to normal operation.
    
    Also deal with the case where the processor does not support
    turbo and the BIOS does not report the fact in MSR_IA32_MISC_ENABLE
    but does report the max and turbo P states as the same value.

    intel_pstate: Fix setting VID
    
    commit c16ed06024a6e699c332831dd50d8276744e3de8 upstream.
    
    Commit 21855ff5 (intel_pstate: Set turbo VID for BayTrail) introduced
    setting the turbo VID which is required to prevent a machine check on
    some Baytrail SKUs under heavy graphics based workloads.  The
    docmumentation update that brought the requirement to light also
    changed the bit mask used for enumerating P state and VID values from
    0x7f to 0x3f.
    
    This change returns the mask value to 0x7f.
    
    Tested with the Intel NUC DN2820FYK,
    BIOS version FYBYT10H.86A.0034.2014.0513.1413 with v3.16-rc1 and
    v3.14.8 kernel versions.

    dm: allocate a special workqueue for deferred device removal
    
    commit acfe0ad74d2e1bfc81d1d7bf5e15b043985d3650 upstream.
    
    The commit 2c140a246dc ("dm: allow remove to be deferred") introduced a
    deferred removal feature for the device mapper.  When this feature is
    used (by passing a flag DM_DEFERRED_REMOVE to DM_DEV_REMOVE_CMD ioctl)
    and the user tries to remove a device that is currently in use, the
    device will be removed automatically in the future when the last user
    closes it.
    
    Device mapper used the system workqueue to perform deferred removals.
    However, some targets (dm-raid1, dm-mpath, dm-stripe) flush work items
    scheduled for the system workqueue from their destructor.  If the
    destructor itself is called from the system workqueue during deferred
    removal, it introduces a possible deadlock - the workqueue tries to flush
    itself.
    
    Fix this possible deadlock by introducing a new workqueue for deferred
    removals.  We allocate just one workqueue for all dm targets.  The
    ability of dm targets to process IOs isn't dependent on deferred removal
    of unused targets, so a deadlock due to shared workqueue isn't possible.
    
    Also, cleanup local_init() to eliminate potential for returning success
    on failure.

    dm io: fix a race condition in the wake up code for sync_io
    
    commit 10f1d5d111e8aed46a0f1179faf9a3cf422f689e upstream.
    
    There's a race condition between the atomic_dec_and_test(&io->count)
    in dec_count() and the waking of the sync_io() thread.  If the thread
    is spuriously woken immediately after the decrement it may exit,
    making the on stack io struct invalid, yet the dec_count could still
    be using it.
    
    Fix this race by using a completion in sync_io() and dec_count().

    commit affb1aff300ddee54df307812b38f166e8a865ef upstream.
    
    Starting with Win8, we have implemented several optimizations to improve the
    scalability and performance of the VMBUS transport between the Host and the
    Guest. Some of the non-performance critical services cannot leverage these
    optimization since they only read and process one message at a time.
    Make adjustments to the callback dispatch code to account for the way
    non-performance critical drivers handle reading of the channel.

    clk: s2mps11: Fix double free corruption during driver unbind
    
    commit 2a96dfa49c83a2a7cbdb11382976aaa6b2636764 upstream.
    
    After unbinding the driver memory was corrupted by double free of
    clk_lookup structure. This lead to OOPS when re-binding the driver
    again.
    
    The driver allocated memory for 'clk_lookup' with devm_kzalloc. During
    driver removal this memory was freed twice: once by clkdev_drop() and
    second by devm code.

    arm64: implement TASK_SIZE_OF
    
    commit fa2ec3ea10bd377f9d55772b1dab65178425a1a2 upstream.
    
    include/linux/sched.h implements TASK_SIZE_OF as TASK_SIZE if it
    is not set by the architecture headers.  TASK_SIZE uses the
    current task to determine the size of the virtual address space.
    On a 64-bit kernel this will cause reading /proc/pid/pagemap of a
    64-bit process from a 32-bit process to return EOF when it reads
    past 0xffffffff.
    
    Implement TASK_SIZE_OF exactly the same as TASK_SIZE with
    test_tsk_thread_flag instead of test_thread_flag.

    powerpc/perf: Clear MMCR2 when enabling PMU
    
    commit b50a6c584bb47b370f84bfd746770c0bbe7129b7 upstream.
    
    On POWER8 when switching to a KVM guest we set bits in MMCR2 to freeze
    the PMU counters. Aside from on boot they are then never reset,
    resulting in stuck perf counters for any user in the guest or host.
    
    We now set MMCR2 to 0 whenever enabling the PMU, which provides a sane
    state for perf to use the PMU counters under either the guest or the
    host.
    
    This was manifesting as a bug with ppc64_cpu --frequency:
    
        $ sudo ppc64_cpu --frequency
        WARNING: couldn't run on cpu 0
        WARNING: couldn't run on cpu 8
          ...
        WARNING: couldn't run on cpu 144
        WARNING: couldn't run on cpu 152
        min:    18446744073.710 GHz (cpu -1)
        max:    0.000 GHz (cpu -1)
        avg:    0.000 GHz
    
    The command uses a perf counter to measure CPU cycles over a fixed
    amount of time, in order to approximate the frequency of the machine.
    The counters were returning zero once a guest was started, regardless of
    weather it was still running or had been shut down.
    
    By dumping the value of MMCR2, it was observed that once a guest is
    running MMCR2 is set to 1s - which stops counters from running:
    
        $ sudo sh -c 'echo p > /proc/sysrq-trigger'
        CPU: 0 PMU registers, ppmu = POWER8 n_counters = 6
        PMC1:  5b635e38 PMC2: 00000000 PMC3: 00000000 PMC4: 00000000
        PMC5:  1bf5a646 PMC6: 5793d378 PMC7: deadbeef PMC8: deadbeef
        MMCR0: 0000000080000000 MMCR1: 000000001e000000 MMCRA: 0000040000000000
        MMCR2: fffffffffffffc00 EBBHR: 0000000000000000

    This is done unconditionally in book3s_hv_interrupts.S upon entering the
    guest, and the original value is only save/restored if the host has
    indicated it was using the PMU. This is okay, however the user of the
    PMU needs to ensure that it is in a defined state when it starts using
    it.

    commit f56029410a13cae3652d1f34788045c40a13ffc7 upstream.
    
    We are seeing a lot of PMU warnings on POWER8:
    
        Can't find PMC that caused IRQ
    
    Looking closer, the active PMC is 0 at this point and we took a PMU
    exception on the transition from negative to 0. Some versions of POWER8
    have an issue where they edge detect and not level detect PMC overflows.
    
    A number of places program the PMC with (0x80000000 - period_left),
    where period_left can be negative. We can either fix all of these or
    just ensure that period_left is always >= 1.
    
    This patch takes the second option.

    ACPI / EC: Fix race condition in ec_transaction_completed()
    
    commit c0d653412fc8450370167a3268b78fc772ff9c87 upstream.
    
    There is a race condition in ec_transaction_completed().
    
    When ec_transaction_completed() is called in the GPE handler, it could
    return true because of (ec->curr == NULL). Then the wake_up() invocation
    could complete the next command unexpectedly since there is no lock between
    the 2 invocations. With the previous cleanup, the IBF=0 waiter race need
    not be handled any more. It's now safe to return a flag from
    advance_condition() to indicate the requirement of wakeup, the flag is
    returned from a locked context.
    
    The ec_transaction_completed() is now only invoked by the ec_poll() where
    the ec->curr is ensured to be different from NULL.
    
    After cleaning up, the EVT_SCI=1 check should be moved out of the wakeup
    condition so that an EVT_SCI raised with (ec->curr == NULL) can trigger a
    QR_SC command.

    ACPI / EC: Remove duplicated ec_wait_ibf0() waiter
    
    commit 9b80f0f73ae1583c22325ede341c74195847618c upstream.
    
    After we've added the first command byte write into advance_transaction(),
    the IBF=0 waiter is duplicated with the command completion waiter
    implemented in the ec_poll() because:
       If IBF=1 blocked the first command byte write invoked in the task
       context ec_poll(), it would be kicked off upon IBF=0 interrupt or timed
       out and retried again in the task context.
    
    Remove this seperate and duplicate IBF=0 waiter.  By doing so we can
    reduce the overall number of times to access the EC_SC(R) status
    register.

    ACPI / EC: Add asynchronous command byte write support
    
    commit f92fca0060fc4dc9227342d0072d75df98c1e5a5 upstream.
    
    Move the first command byte write into advance_transaction() so that all
    EC register accesses that can affect the command processing state machine
    can happen in this asynchronous state machine advancement function.
    
    The advance_transaction() function then can be a complete implementation
    of an asyncrhonous transaction for a single command so that:
     1. The first command byte can be written in the interrupt context;
     2. The command completion waiter can also be used to wait the first command
        byte's timeout;
     3. In BURST mode, the follow-up command bytes can be written in the
        interrupt context directly, so that it doesn't need to return to the
        task context. Returning to the task context reduces the throughput of
        the BURST mode and in the worst cases where the system workload is very
        high, this leads to the hardware driven automatic BURST mode exit.
    
    In order not to increase memory consumption, convert 'done' into 'flags'
    to contain multiple indications:
     1. ACPI_EC_COMMAND_COMPLETE: converting from original 'done' condition,
        indicating the completion of the command transaction.
     2. ACPI_EC_COMMAND_POLL: indicating the availability of writing the first
        command byte. A new command can utilize this flag to compete for the
        right of accessing the underlying hardware. There is a follow-up bug
        fix that has utilized this new flag.
    
    The 2 flags are important because it also reflects a key concept of IO
    programs' design used in the system softwares. Normally an IO program
    running in the kernel should first be implemented in the asynchronous way.
    And the 2 flags are the most common way to implement its synchronous
    operations on top of the asynchronous operations:
    1. POLL: This flag can be used to block until the asynchronous operations
             can happen.
    2. COMPLETE: This flag can be used to block until the asynchronous
                 operations have completed.
    By constructing code cleanly in this way, many difficult problems can be
    solved smoothly.

    ACPI / EC: Avoid race condition related to advance_transaction()
    
    commit 66b42b78bc1e816f92b662e8888c89195e4199e1 upstream.
    
    The advance_transaction() will be invoked from the IRQ context GPE handler
    and the task context ec_poll(). The handling of this function is locked so
    that the EC state machine are ensured to be advanced sequentially.
    
    But there is a problem. Before invoking advance_transaction(), EC_SC(R) is
    read. Then for advance_transaction(), there could be race condition around
    the lock from both contexts. The first one reading the register could fail
    this race and when it passes the stale register value to the state machine
    advancement code, the hardware condition is totally different from when
    the register is read. And the hardware accesses determined from the wrong
    hardware status can break the EC state machine. And there could be cases
    that the functionalities of the platform firmware are seriously affected.
    For example:
     1. When 2 EC_DATA(W) writes compete the IBF=0, the 2nd EC_DATA(W) write may
        be invalid due to IBF=1 after the 1st EC_DATA(W) write. Then the
        hardware will either refuse to respond a next EC_SC(W) write of the next
        command or discard the current WR_EC command when it receives a EC_SC(W)
        write of the next command.
     2. When 1 EC_SC(W) write and 1 EC_DATA(W) write compete the IBF=0, the
        EC_DATA(W) write may be invalid due to IBF=1 after the EC_SC(W) write.
        The next EC_DATA(R) could never be responded by the hardware. This is
        the root cause of the reported issue.
    
    Fix this issue by moving the EC_SC(R) access into the lock so that we can
    ensure that the state machine is advanced consistently.

    ACPI / resources: only reject zero length resources based at address zero
    
    commit 867f9d463b82462793ea4610e748be0b04b37fc7 upstream.
    
    The recently merged change (in v3.14-rc6) to ACPI resource detection
    (below) causes all zero length ACPI resources to be elided from the
    table:

        ACPI / resources: ignore invalid ACPI device resources
    
    This change has caused a regression in (at least) serial port detection
    for a number of machines (see LP#1313981 [1]).  These seem to represent
    their IO regions (presumably incorrectly) as a zero length region.
    Reverting the above commit restores these serial devices.
    
    Only elide zero length resources which lie at address 0.

    commit c024044d4da2c9c3b32933b4235df1e409293b84 upstream.
    
    The module test script for the adm1021 driver exposes a cache problem
    when writing temperature limits. temp_min and temp_max are expected
    to be stored in milli-degrees C but are stored in degrees C.

    hwmon: (adm1029) Ensure the fan_div cache is updated in set_fan_div
    
    commit 1035a9e3e9c76b64a860a774f5b867d28d34acc2 upstream.
    
    Writing to fanX_div does not clear the cache. As a result, reading
    from fanX_div may return the old value for up to two seconds
    after writing a new value.
    
    This patch ensures the fan_div cache is updated in set_fan_div().

    hwmon: (adm1031) Fix writes to limit registers
    
    commit 145e74a4e5022225adb84f4e5d4fff7938475c35 upstream.
    
    Upper limit for write operations to temperature limit registers
    was clamped to a fractional value. However, limit registers do
    not support fractional values. As a result, upper limits of 127.5
    degrees C or higher resulted in a rounded limit of 128 degrees C.
    Since limit registers are signed, this was stored as -128 degrees C.
    Clamp limits to (-55, +127) degrees C to solve the problem.
    
    Value on writes to auto_temp[12]_min and auto_temp[12]_max were not
    clamped at all, but masked. As a result, out-of-range writes resulted
    in a more or less arbitrary limit. Clamp those attributes to (0, 127)
    degrees C for more predictable results.

    commit f6c2dd20108c35e30e2c1f3c6142d189451a626b upstream.
    
    It is customary to clamp limits instead of bailing out with an error
    if a configured limit is out of the range supported by the driver.
    This simplifies limit configuration, since the user will not typically
    know chip and/or driver specific limits.

    We used the tz->ops->get_crit_temp && !tz->ops->get_crit_temp(tz, temp)
    to decide if we need to create the temp_crit attribute file but we just
    check if tz->ops->get_crit_temp exists to decide if we need to remove
    that attribute file. Some ACPI thermal zone doesn't have a valid critical
    trip point and that would result in removing a non-existent device file
    on thermal module unload.

    i8k: Fix non-SMP operation
    
    commit 6d827fbcc370ca259a2905309f64161ab7b10596 upstream.
    
    Commit f36fdb9f0266 (i8k: Force SMM to run on CPU 0) adds support
    for multi-core CPUs to the driver. Unfortunately, that causes it
    to fail loading if compiled without SMP support, at least on
    32 bit kernels. Kernel log shows "i8k: unable to get SMM Dell
    signature", and function i8k_smm is found to return -EINVAL.
    
    Testing revealed that the culprit is the missing return value check
    of set_cpus_allowed_ptr.

    In my investigation, I found the root cause is wq_numa_possible_cpumask.
    All entries of wq_numa_possible_cpumask is allocated by
    alloc_cpumask_var_node(). And these entries are used without initializing.
    So these entries have wrong value.
    
    When hot-adding and onlining CPU, wq_update_unbound_numa() is called.
    wq_update_unbound_numa() calls alloc_unbound_pwq(). And alloc_unbound_pwq()
    calls get_unbound_pool(). In get_unbound_pool(), worker_pool->node is set
    as follow:
    
    3592         /* if cpumask is contained inside a NUMA node, we belong to that node */
    3593         if (wq_numa_enabled) {
    3594                 for_each_node(node) {
    3595                         if (cpumask_subset(pool->attrs->cpumask,
    3596                                            wq_numa_possible_cpumask[node])) {
    3597                                 pool->node = node;
    3598                                 break;
    3599                         }
    3600                 }
    3601         }
    
    But wq_numa_possible_cpumask[node] does not have correct cpumask. So, wrong
    node is selected. As a result, kernel panic occurs.
    
    By this patch, all entries of wq_numa_possible_cpumask are allocated by
    zalloc_cpumask_var_node to initialize them. And the panic disappeared.

    The cause is that cpuset_mems_allowed() try to take
    mutex_lock(&callback_mutex) under the rcu_read_lock(which was hold in
    __mpol_dup()). And in cpuset_mems_allowed(), the access to cpuset is
    under rcu_read_lock, so in __mpol_dup, we can reduce the rcu_read_lock
    protection region to protect the access to cpuset only in
    current_cpuset_is_being_rebound(). So that we can avoid this bug.
    
    This patch is a temporary solution that just addresses the bug
    mentioned above, can not fix the long-standing issue about cpuset.mems
    rebinding on fork():
    
    "When the forker's task_struct is duplicated (which includes
     ->mems_allowed) and it races with an update to cpuset_being_rebound
     in update_tasks_nodemask() then the task's mems_allowed doesn't get
     updated. And the child task's mems_allowed can be wrong if the
     cpuset's nodemask changes before the child has been added to the
     cgroup's tasklist."

    parisc,metag: Do not hardcode maximum userspace stack size
    
    commit 042d27acb64924a0e8a43e972485913a32407beb upstream.
    
    This patch affects only architectures where the stack grows upwards
    (currently parisc and metag only). On those do not hardcode the maximum
    initial stack size to 1GB for 32-bit processes, but make it configurable
    via a config option.
    
    The main problem with the hardcoded stack size is, that we have two
    memory regions which grow upwards: stack and heap. To keep most of the
    memory available for heap in a flexmap memory layout, it makes no sense
    to hard allocate up to 1GB of the memory for stack which can't be used
    as heap then.
    
    This patch makes the stack size for 32-bit processes configurable and

    parisc: fix fanotify_mark() syscall on 32bit compat kernel
    
    commit ab8a261ba5e2dd9206da640de5870cc31d568a7c upstream.
    
    On parisc we can not use the existing compat implementation for fanotify_mark()
    because for the 64bit mask parameter the higher and lower 32bits are ordered
    differently than what the compat function expects from big endian
    architectures.
    
    Specifically:
    It finally turned out, that on hppa we end up with different assignments
    of parameters to kernel arguments depending on if we call the glibc
    wrapper function
     int fanotify_mark (int __fanotify_fd, unsigned int __flags,
                        uint64_t __mask, int __dfd, const char *__pathname);
    or directly calling the syscall manually
     syscall(__NR_fanotify_mark, ...)
    
    Reason is, that the syscall() function is implemented as C-function and
    because we now have the sysno as first parameter in front of the other
    parameters the compiler will unexpectedly add an empty paramenter in
    front of the u64 value to ensure the correct calling alignment for 64bit
    values.
    This means, on hppa you can't simply use syscall() to call the kernel
    fanotify_mark() function directly, but you have to use the glibc
    function instead.
    
    This patch fixes the kernel in the hppa-arch specifc coding to adjust
    the parameters in a way as if userspace calls the glibc wrapper function
    fanotify_mark().

    iio: ti_am335x_adc: Fix: Use same step id at FIFOs both ends
    
    commit baa3c65298c089a9014b4e523a14ec2885cca1bc upstream.
    
    Since AI lines could be selected at will (linux-3.11) the sending
    and receiving ends of the FIFO does not agree about what step is used
    for a line. It only works if the last lines are used, like 5,6,7,
    and fails if ie 2,4,6 is selected in DT.
