    selftests: netfilter: check stateless nat udp checksum fixup
    
    commit aad51ca71ad83273e8826d6cfdcf53c98748d1fa upstream.
    
    Add a test that sends large udp packet (which is fragmented)
    via a stateless nft nat rule, i.e. 'ip saddr set 10.2.3.4'
    and check that the datagram is received by peer.
    
    On kernels without
    commit 4e1860a38637 ("netfilter: nft_payload: do not update layer 4 checksum when mangling fragments")',
    this will fail with:
    
    cmp: EOF on /tmp/tmp.V1q0iXJyQF which is empty
    -rw------- 1 root root 4096 Jan 24 22:03 /tmp/tmp.Aaqnq4rBKS

    cgroup/cpuset: Fix "suspicious RCU usage" lockdep warning
    
    commit 2bdfd2825c9662463371e6691b1a794e97fa36b4 upstream.
    
    It was found that a "suspicious RCU usage" lockdep warning was issued
    with the rcu_read_lock() call in update_sibling_cpumasks().  It is
    because the update_cpumasks_hier() function may sleep. So we have
    to release the RCU lock, call update_cpumasks_hier() and reacquire
    it afterward.
    
    Also add a percpu_rwsem_assert_held() in update_sibling_cpumasks()
    instead of stating that in the comment.

    perf/x86/intel/pt: Fix crash with stop filters in single-range mode
    
    commit 1d9093457b243061a9bba23543c38726e864a643 upstream.
    
    Add a check for !buf->single before calling pt_buffer_region_size in a
    place where a missing check can cause a kernel crash.
    
    Fixes a bug introduced by commit 670638477aed ("perf/x86/intel/pt:
    Opportunistically use single range output mode"), which added a
    support for PT single-range output mode. Since that commit if a PT
    stop filter range is hit while tracing, the kernel will crash because
    of a null pointer dereference in pt_handle_status due to calling
    pt_buffer_region_size without a ToPA configured.
    
    The commit which introduced single-range mode guarded almost all uses of
    the ToPA buffer variables with checks of the buf->single variable, but
    missed the case where tracing was stopped by the PT hardware, which
    happens when execution hits a configured stop filter.
    
    Tested that hitting a stop filter while PT recording successfully
    records a trace with this patch but crashes without this patch.

    perf stat: Fix display of grouped aliased events
    
    [ Upstream commit b2b1aa73ade982c175ac926a1fd34e76ad628b94 ]
    
    An event may have a number of uncore aliases that when added to the
    evlist are consecutive.
    
    If there are multiple uncore events in a group then
    parse_events__set_leader_for_uncore_aliase will reorder the evlist so
    that events on the same PMU are adjacent.
    
    The collect_all_aliases function assumes that aliases are in blocks so
    that only the first counter is printed and all others are marked merged.
    
    The reordering for groups breaks the assumption and so all counts are
    printed.
    
    This change removes the assumption from collect_all_aliases
    that the events are in blocks and instead processes the entire evlist.
    
    Before:
    
      ```
      $ perf stat -e '{UNC_CHA_TOR_OCCUPANCY.IA_MISS_DRD_REMOTE,UNC_CHA_TOR_INSERTS.IA_MISS_DRD_REMOTE},duration_time' -a -A -- sleep 1

    perf: Copy perf_event_attr::sig_data on modification
    
    [ Upstream commit 3c25fc97f5590060464cabfa25710970ecddbc96 ]
    
    The intent has always been that perf_event_attr::sig_data should also be
    modifiable along with PERF_EVENT_IOC_MODIFY_ATTRIBUTES, because it is
    observable by user space if SIGTRAP on events is requested.
    
    Currently only PERF_TYPE_BREAKPOINT is modifiable, and explicitly copies
    relevant breakpoint-related attributes in hw_breakpoint_copy_attr().
    This misses copying perf_event_attr::sig_data.
    
    Since sig_data is not specific to PERF_TYPE_BREAKPOINT, introduce a
    helper to copy generic event-type-independent attributes on
    modification.

    kvm/arm64: rework guest entry logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 8cfe148a7136bc60452a5c6b7ac2d9d15c36909b ]
    
    In kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run() we enter an RCU extended quiescent state
    (EQS) by calling guest_enter_irqoff(), and unmasked IRQs prior to
    exiting the EQS by calling guest_exit(). As the IRQ entry code will not
    wake RCU in this case, we may run the core IRQ code and IRQ handler
    without RCU watching, leading to various potential problems.
    
    Additionally, we do not inform lockdep or tracing that interrupts will
    be enabled during guest execution, which caan lead to misleading traces
    and warnings that interrupts have been enabled for overly-long periods.
    
    This patch fixes these issues by using the new timing and context
    entry/exit helpers to ensure that interrupts are handled during guest
    vtime but with RCU watching, with a sequence:
    
            guest_timing_enter_irqoff();
    
            guest_state_enter_irqoff();
            < run the vcpu >
            guest_state_exit_irqoff();
    
            < take any pending IRQs >
    
            guest_timing_exit_irqoff();
    
    Since instrumentation may make use of RCU, we must also ensure that no
    instrumented code is run during the EQS. I've split out the critical
    section into a new kvm_arm_enter_exit_vcpu() helper which is marked
    noinstr.

    kvm: add guest_state_{enter,exit}_irqoff()
    
    commit ef9989afda73332df566852d6e9ca695c05f10ce upstream.
    
    When transitioning to/from guest mode, it is necessary to inform
    lockdep, tracing, and RCU in a specific order, similar to the
    requirements for transitions to/from user mode. Additionally, it is
    necessary to perform vtime accounting for a window around running the
    guest, with RCU enabled, such that timer interrupts taken from the guest
    can be accounted as guest time.
    
    Most architectures don't handle all the necessary pieces, and a have a
    number of common bugs, including unsafe usage of RCU during the window
    between guest_enter() and guest_exit().
    
    On x86, this was dealt with across commits:
    
      87fa7f3e98a1310e ("x86/kvm: Move context tracking where it belongs")
      0642391e2139a2c1 ("x86/kvm/vmx: Add hardirq tracing to guest enter/exit")
      9fc975e9efd03e57 ("x86/kvm/svm: Add hardirq tracing on guest enter/exit")
      3ebccdf373c21d86 ("x86/kvm/vmx: Move guest enter/exit into .noinstr.text")
      135961e0a7d555fc ("x86/kvm/svm: Move guest enter/exit into .noinstr.text")
      160457140187c5fb ("KVM: x86: Defer vtime accounting 'til after IRQ handling")
      bc908e091b326467 ("KVM: x86: Consolidate guest enter/exit logic to common helpers")
    
    ... but those fixes are specific to x86, and as the resulting logic
    (while correct) is split across generic helper functions and
    x86-specific helper functions, it is difficult to see that the
    entry/exit accounting is balanced.
    
    This patch adds generic helpers which architectures can use to handle
    guest entry/exit consistently and correctly. The guest_{enter,exit}()
    helpers are split into guest_timing_{enter,exit}() to perform vtime
    accounting, and guest_context_{enter,exit}() to perform the necessary
    context tracking and RCU management. The existing guest_{enter,exit}()
    heleprs are left as wrappers of these.
    
    Atop this, new guest_state_enter_irqoff() and guest_state_exit_irqoff()
    helpers are added to handle the ordering of lockdep, tracing, and RCU
    manageent. These are inteneded to mirror exit_to_user_mode() and
    enter_from_user_mode().
    
    Subsequent patches will migrate architectures over to the new helpers,
    following a sequence:
    
            guest_timing_enter_irqoff();
    
            guest_state_enter_irqoff();
            < run the vcpu >
            guest_state_exit_irqoff();
    
            < take any pending IRQs >
    
            guest_timing_exit_irqoff();
    
    This sequences handles all of the above correctly, and more clearly
    balances the entry and exit portions, making it easier to understand.
    
    The existing helpers are marked as deprecated, and will be removed once
    all architectures have been converted.
    
    There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.

    bpf: Use VM_MAP instead of VM_ALLOC for ringbuf
    
    commit b293dcc473d22a62dc6d78de2b15e4f49515db56 upstream.
    
    After commit 2fd3fb0be1d1 ("kasan, vmalloc: unpoison VM_ALLOC pages
    after mapping"), non-VM_ALLOC mappings will be marked as accessible
    in __get_vm_area_node() when KASAN is enabled. But now the flag for
    ringbuf area is VM_ALLOC, so KASAN will complain out-of-bound access
    after vmap() returns. Because the ringbuf area is created by mapping
    allocated pages, so use VM_MAP instead.
    
    After the change, info in /proc/vmallocinfo also changes from
      [start]-[end]   24576 ringbuf_map_alloc+0x171/0x290 vmalloc user
    to
      [start]-[end]   24576 ringbuf_map_alloc+0x171/0x290 vmap user

    nfsd: nfsd4_setclientid_confirm mistakenly expires confirmed client.
    
    commit ab451ea952fe9d7afefae55ddb28943a148247fe upstream.
    
    From RFC 7530 Section 16.34.5:
    
    o  The server has not recorded an unconfirmed { v, x, c, *, * } and
       has recorded a confirmed { v, x, c, *, s }.  If the principals of
       the record and of SETCLIENTID_CONFIRM do not match, the server
       returns NFS4ERR_CLID_INUSE without removing any relevant leased
       client state, and without changing recorded callback and
       callback_ident values for client { x }.
    
    The current code intends to do what the spec describes above but
    it forgot to set 'old' to NULL resulting to the confirmed client
    to be expired.

    pinctrl: intel: fix unexpected interrupt
    
    commit e986f0e602f19ecb7880b04dd1db415ed9bca3f6 upstream.
    
    ASUS Chromebook C223 with Celeron N3350 crashes sometimes during
    cold booot. Inspection of the kernel log showed that it gets into
    an inifite loop logging the following message:
    
    ->handle_irq():  000000009cdb51e8, handle_bad_irq+0x0/0x251
    ->irq_data.chip(): 000000005ec212a7, 0xffffa043009d8e7
    ->action(): 00000
       IRQ_NOPROBE set
    unexpected IRQ trap at vector 7c
    
    The issue happens during cold boot but only if cold boot happens
    at most several dozen seconds after Chromebook is powered off. For
    longer intervals between power off and power on (cold boot) the issue
    does not reproduce. The unexpected interrupt is sourced from INT3452
    GPIO pin which is used for SD card detect. Investigation relevealed
    that when the interval between power off and power on (cold boot)
    is less than several dozen seconds then values of INT3452 GPIO interrupt
    enable and interrupt pending registers survive power off and power
    on sequence and interrupt for SD card detect pin is enabled and pending
    during probe of SD controller which causes the unexpected IRQ message.
    "Intel Pentium and Celeron Processor N- and J- Series" volume 3 doc
    mentions that GPIO interrupt enable and status registers default
    value is 0x0.
    The fix clears INT3452 GPIO interrupt enabled and interrupt pending
    registers in its probe function.

    pinctrl: intel: Fix a glitch when updating IRQ flags on a preconfigured line
    
    commit e12963c453263d5321a2c610e98cbc731233b685 upstream.
    
    The commit af7e3eeb84e2 ("pinctrl: intel: Disable input and output buffer
    when switching to GPIO") hadn't taken into account an update of the IRQ
    flags scenario.
    
    When updating the IRQ flags on the preconfigured line the ->irq_set_type()
    is called again. In such case the sequential Rx buffer configuration
    changes may trigger a falling or rising edge interrupt that may lead,
    on some platforms, to an undesired event.
    
    This may happen because each of intel_gpio_set_gpio_mode() and
    __intel_gpio_set_direction() updates the pad configuration with a different
    value of the GPIORXDIS bit. Notable, that the intel_gpio_set_gpio_mode() is
    called only for the pads that are configured as an input. Due to this fact,
    integrate the logic of __intel_gpio_set_direction() call into the
    intel_gpio_set_gpio_mode() so that the Rx buffer won't be disabled and
    immediately re-enabled.

    - PH8 and PH9 use the "i2s3" function name twice in each pin

    commit a64067f4cecaaa4deed8e33d3266bc0bcc189142 upstream.
    
    A previous change to simple-card resulted in asoc_simple_parse_dai

    unlikely to have a valid DAI name. This caused simple-card to fail to

    ASoC: xilinx: xlnx_formatter_pcm: Make buffer bytes multiple of period bytes
    
    commit e958b5884725dac86d36c1e7afe5a55f31feb0b2 upstream.
    
    This patch is based on one in the Xilinx kernel tree, "ASoc: xlnx: Make
    buffer bytes multiple of period bytes" by Devarsh Thakkar. The same
    issue exists in the mainline version of the driver. The original
    patch description is as follows:
    
    "The Xilinx Audio Formatter IP has a constraint on period
    bytes to be multiple of 64. This leads to driver changing
    the period size to suitable frames such that period bytes
    are multiple of 64.
    
    Now since period bytes and period size are updated but not
    the buffer bytes, this may make the buffer bytes unaligned
    and not multiple of period bytes.
    
    When this happens we hear popping noise as while DMA is being
    done the buffer bytes are not enough to complete DMA access
    for last period of frame within the application buffer boundary.
    
    To avoid this, align buffer bytes too as multiple of 64, and
    set another constraint to always enforce number of periods as
    integer. Now since, there is already a rule in alsa core
    to enforce Buffer size = Number of Periods * Period Size
    this automatically aligns buffer bytes as multiple of period
    bytes."

    net: stmmac: ensure PTP time register reads are consistent
    
    commit 80d4609008e6d696a279e39ae7458c916fcd44c1 upstream.
    
    Even if protected from preemption and interrupts, a small time window
    remains when the 2 register reads could return inconsistent values,
    each time the "seconds" register changes. This could lead to an about
    1-second error in the reported time.
    
    Add logic to ensure the "seconds" and "nanoseconds" values are consistent.

    net: stmmac: dump gmac4 DMA registers correctly
    
    commit 7af037c39b600bac2c716dd1228e8ddbe149573f upstream.
    
    Unlike gmac100, gmac1000, gmac4 has 27 DMA registers and they are
    located at DMA_CHAN_BASE_ADDR (0x1100). In order for ethtool to dump
    gmac4 DMA registers correctly, this commit checks if a net_device has
    gmac4 and uses different logic to dump its DMA registers.
    
    This fixes the following KASAN warning, which can normally be triggered
    by a command similar like "ethtool -d eth0":

    net: macsec: Verify that send_sci is on when setting Tx sci explicitly
    
    commit d0cfa548dbde354de986911d3913897b5448faad upstream.
    
    When setting Tx sci explicit, the Rx side is expected to use this
    sci and not recalculate it from the packet.However, in case of Tx sci
    is explicit and send_sci is off, the receiver is wrongly recalculate
    the sci from the source MAC address which most likely be different
    than the explicit sci.
    
    Fix by preventing such configuration when macsec newlink is established
    and return EINVAL error code on such cases.

    commit 9cef24c8b76c1f6effe499d2f131807c90f7ce9a upstream.
    
    Current macsec netdev notify handler handles NETDEV_UNREGISTER event by
    releasing relevant SW resources only, this causes resources leak in case
    of macsec HW offload, as the underlay driver was not notified to clean
    it's macsec offload resources.
    
    Fix by calling the underlay driver to clean it's relevant resources
    by moving offload handling from macsec_dellink() to macsec_common_dellink()
    when handling NETDEV_UNREGISTER event.

    net: stmmac: properly handle with runtime pm in stmmac_dvr_remove()
    
    commit 6449520391dfc3d2cef134f11a91251a054ff7d0 upstream.
    
    There are two issues with runtime pm handling in stmmac_dvr_remove():
    
    1. the mac is runtime suspended before stopping dma and rx/tx. We
    need to ensure the device is properly resumed back.
    
    2. the stmmaceth clk enable/disable isn't balanced in both exit and
    error handling code path. Take the exit code path for example, when we
    unbind the driver or rmmod the driver module, the mac is runtime
    suspended as said above, so the stmmaceth clk is disabled, but
            stmmac_dvr_remove()
              stmmac_remove_config_dt()
                clk_disable_unprepare()
    CCF will complain this time. The error handling code path suffers
    from the similar situtaion.
    
    Here are kernel warnings in error handling code path on Allwinner D1
    platform:

    net/smc: Forward wakeup to smc socket waitqueue after fallback
    
    commit 341adeec9adad0874f29a0a1af35638207352a39 upstream.
    
    When we replace TCP with SMC and a fallback occurs, there may be
    some socket waitqueue entries remaining in smc socket->wq, such
    as eppoll_entries inserted by userspace applications.
    
    After the fallback, data flows over TCP/IP and only clcsocket->wq
    will be woken up. Applications can't be notified by the entries
    which were inserted in smc socket->wq before fallback. So we need
    a mechanism to wake up smc socket->wq at the same time if some
    entries remaining in it.
    
    The current workaround is to transfer the entries from smc socket->wq
    to clcsock->wq during the fallback. But this may cause a crash
    like this:
    
     general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000100: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI

      <TASK>
    
    The crash is caused by privately transferring waitqueue entries from
    smc socket->wq to clcsock->wq. The owners of these entries, such as
    epoll, have no idea that the entries have been transferred to a
    different socket wait queue and still use original waitqueue spinlock
    (smc socket->wq.wait.lock) to make the entries operation exclusive,
    but it doesn't work. The operations to the entries, such as removing
    from the waitqueue (now is clcsock->wq after fallback), may cause a
    crash when clcsock waitqueue is being iterated over at the moment.
    
    This patch tries to fix this by no longer transferring wait queue
    entries privately, but introducing own implementations of clcsock's
    callback functions in fallback situation. The callback functions will
    forward the wakeup to smc socket->wq if clcsock->wq is actually woken
    up and smc socket->wq has remaining entries.

    commit aeac4554eb549037ff2f719200c0a9c1c25e7eaa upstream.
    
    Prior to commit fa538f7cf05aa ("netfilter: nf_reject: add reject skbuff
    creation helpers"), nft_reject_bridge did not assign to nskb->dev before
    passing nskb on to br_forward(). The shared skbuff creation helpers
    introduced in above commit do which seems to confuse br_forward() as
    reject statements in prerouting hook won't emit a packet anymore.
    
    Fix this by simply passing NULL instead of 'dev' to the helpers - they
    use the pointer for just that assignment, nothing else.

    commit 37c2c83ca4f1ef4b6908181ac98e18360af89b42 upstream.
    
    The issue happens in several error paths in uniphier_spi_probe().
    When either dma_get_slave_caps() or devm_spi_register_master() returns
    an error code, the function forgets to decrease the refcount of both
    `dma_rx` and `dma_tx` objects, which may lead to refcount leaks.

    commit 9b45a7738eec52bf0f5d8d3d54e822962781c5f2 upstream.
    
    The polling loop for the register change in iommu_ga_log_enable() needs
    to have a udelay() in it.  Otherwise the CPU might be faster than the
    IOMMU hardware and wrongly trigger the WARN_ON() further down the code
    stream. Use a 10us for udelay(), has there is some hardware where
    activation of the GA log can take more than a 100ms.
    
    A future optimization should move the activation check of the GA log
    to the point where it gets used for the first time. But that is a
    bigger change and not suitable for a fix.

    after fail to allocate ir_domain, though it also should be freed in case
    dmar_enable_qi returns error.
    
    Besides free fn, irq_domain and ir_msi_domain need to be removed as well
    if intel_setup_irq_remapping fails to enable queued invalidation.

    If the codec->registered is not set then it means that pm_runtime is
    not yet enabled and the codec->pcm_list_head has not been initialized.
    
    The access to the not initialized pcm_list_head will lead a kernel crash

    KVM: arm64: Stop handle_exit() from handling HVC twice when an SError occurs
    
    commit 1229630af88620f6e3a621a1ebd1ca14d9340df7 upstream.
    
    Prior to commit defe21f49bc9 ("KVM: arm64: Move PC rollback on SError to
    HYP"), when an SError is synchronised due to another exception, KVM
    handles the SError first. If the guest survives, the instruction that
    triggered the original exception is re-exectued to handle the first
    exception. HVC is treated as a special case as the instruction wouldn't
    normally be re-exectued, as its not a trap.
    
    Commit defe21f49bc9 didn't preserve the behaviour of the 'return 1'
    that skips the rest of handle_exit().
    
    Since commit defe21f49bc9, KVM will try to handle the SError and the
    original exception at the same time. When the exception was an HVC,
    fixup_guest_exit() has already rolled back ELR_EL2, meaning if the
    guest has virtual SError masked, it will execute and handle the HVC
    twice.
    
    Restore the original behaviour.

    KVM: arm64: Avoid consuming a stale esr value when SError occur
    
    commit 1c71dbc8a179d99dd9bb7e7fc1888db613cf85de upstream.
    
    When any exception other than an IRQ occurs, the CPU updates the ESR_EL2
    register with the exception syndrome. An SError may also become pending,
    and will be synchronised by KVM. KVM notes the exception type, and whether
    an SError was synchronised in exit_code.
    
    When an exception other than an IRQ occurs, fixup_guest_exit() updates
    vcpu->arch.fault.esr_el2 from the hardware register. When an SError was
    synchronised, the vcpu esr value is used to determine if the exception
    was due to an HVC. If so, ELR_EL2 is moved back one instruction. This
    is so that KVM can process the SError first, and re-execute the HVC if
    the guest survives the SError.
    
    But if an IRQ synchronises an SError, the vcpu's esr value is stale.
    If the previous non-IRQ exception was an HVC, KVM will corrupt ELR_EL2,
    causing an unrelated guest instruction to be executed twice.
    
    Check ARM_EXCEPTION_CODE() before messing with ELR_EL2, IRQs don't
    update this register so don't need to check.

    Revert "ASoC: mediatek: Check for error clk pointer"
    
    This reverts commit 38accfd85e41b7ca547c5a7d4866bbc1462950cb which is
    commit 9de2b9286a6dd16966959b3cb34fc2ddfd39213e upstream
    
    With this patch in the tree, Chromebooks running the affected hardware
    no longer boot. Bisect points to this patch, and reverting it fixes
    the problem.
    
    An analysis of the code with this patch applied shows:
    
            ret = init_clks(pdev, clk);
            if (ret)
                    return ERR_PTR(ret);
    ...
                    for (j = 0; j < MAX_CLKS && data->clk_id[j]; j++) {
                            struct clk *c = clk[data->clk_id[j]];
    
                            if (IS_ERR(c)) {
                                    dev_err(&pdev->dev, "%s: clk unavailable\n",
                                            data->name);
                                    return ERR_CAST(c);
                            }
    
                            scpd->clk[j] = c;
                    }
    
    Not all clocks in the clk_names array have to be present. Only the clocks
    in the data->clk_id array are actually needed. The code already checks if
    the required clocks are available and bails out if not. The assumption that
    all clocks have to be present is wrong, and commit 9de2b9286a6d needs to be
    reverted.

    mptcp: fix msk traversal in mptcp_nl_cmd_set_flags()
    
    commit 8e9eacad7ec7a9cbf262649ebf1fa6e6f6cc7d82 upstream.
    
    The MPTCP endpoint list is under RCU protection, guarded by the
    pernet spinlock. mptcp_nl_cmd_set_flags() traverses the list
    without acquiring the spin-lock nor under the RCU critical section.
    
    This change addresses the issue performing the lookup and the endpoint
    update under the pernet spinlock.
    
    [The upstream commit had to handle a lookup_by_id variable that is only
     present in 5.17. This version of the patch removes that variable, so
     the __lookup_addr() function only handles the lookup as it is
     implemented in 5.15 and 5.16. It also removes one 'const' keyword to
     prevent a warning due to differing const-ness in the 5.17 version of
     addresses_equal().]

    fbcon: Add option to enable legacy hardware acceleration
    
    commit a3f781a9d6114c1d1e01defb7aa234dec45d2a5f upstream.
    
    Add a config option CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_LEGACY_ACCELERATION to
    enable bitblt and fillrect hardware acceleration in the framebuffer
    console. If disabled, such acceleration will not be used, even if it is
    supported by the graphics hardware driver.
    
    If you plan to use DRM as your main graphics output system, you should
    disable this option since it will prevent compiling in code which isn't
    used later on when DRM takes over.
    
    For all other configurations, e.g. if none of your graphic cards support
    DRM (yet), DRM isn't available for your architecture, or you can't be
    sure that the graphic card in the target system will support DRM, you
    most likely want to enable this option.
    
    In the non-accelerated case (e.g. when DRM is used), the inlined
    fb_scrollmode() function is hardcoded to return SCROLL_REDRAW and as such the
    compiler is able to optimize much unneccesary code away.
    
    In this v3 patch version I additionally changed the GETVYRES() and GETVXRES()
    macros to take a pointer to the fbcon_display struct. This fixes the build when
    console rotation is enabled and helps the compiler again to optimize out code.

    Revert "fbcon: Disable accelerated scrolling"
    
    commit 87ab9f6b7417349aa197a6c7098d4fdd4beebb74 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 39aead8373b3c20bb5965c024dfb51a94e526151.
    
    Revert the first (of 2) commits which disabled scrolling acceleration in
    fbcon/fbdev.  It introduced a regression for fbdev-supported graphic cards
    because of the performance penalty by doing screen scrolling by software
    instead of using the existing graphic card 2D hardware acceleration.
    
    Console scrolling acceleration was disabled by dropping code which
    checked at runtime the driver hardware capabilities for the
    BINFO_HWACCEL_COPYAREA or FBINFO_HWACCEL_FILLRECT flags and if set, it
    enabled scrollmode SCROLL_MOVE which uses hardware acceleration to move
    screen contents.  After dropping those checks scrollmode was hard-wired
    to SCROLL_REDRAW instead, which forces all graphic cards to redraw every
    character at the new screen position when scrolling.
    
    This change effectively disabled all hardware-based scrolling acceleration for
    ALL drivers, because now all kind of 2D hardware acceleration (bitblt,
    fillrect) in the drivers isn't used any longer.
    
    The original commit message mentions that only 3 DRM drivers (nouveau, omapdrm
    and gma500) used hardware acceleration in the past and thus code for checking
    and using scrolling acceleration is obsolete.
    
    This statement is NOT TRUE, because beside the DRM drivers there are around 35
    other fbdev drivers which depend on fbdev/fbcon and still provide hardware
    acceleration for fbdev/fbcon.
    
    The original commit message also states that syzbot found lots of bugs in fbcon
    and thus it's "often the solution to just delete code and remove features".
    This is true, and the bugs - which actually affected all users of fbcon,
    including DRM - were fixed, or code was dropped like e.g. the support for
    software scrollback in vgacon (commit 973c096f6a85).
    
    So to further analyze which bugs were found by syzbot, I've looked through all
    patches in drivers/video which were tagged with syzbot or syzkaller back to
    year 2005. The vast majority fixed the reported issues on a higher level, e.g.
    when screen is to be resized, or when font size is to be changed. The few ones
    which touched driver code fixed a real driver bug, e.g. by adding a check.
    
    But NONE of those patches touched code of either the SCROLL_MOVE or the
    SCROLL_REDRAW case.
    
    That means, there was no real reason why SCROLL_MOVE had to be ripped-out and
    just SCROLL_REDRAW had to be used instead. The only reason I can imagine so far
    was that SCROLL_MOVE wasn't used by DRM and as such it was assumed that it
    could go away. That argument completely missed the fact that SCROLL_MOVE is
    still heavily used by fbdev (non-DRM) drivers.
    
    Some people mention that using memcpy() instead of the hardware acceleration is
    pretty much the same speed. But that's not true, at least not for older graphic
    cards and machines where we see speed decreases by factor 10 and more and thus
    this change leads to console responsiveness way worse than before.
    
    That's why the original commit is to be reverted. By reverting we
    reintroduce hardware-based scrolling acceleration and fix the
    performance regression for fbdev drivers.
    
    There isn't any impact on DRM when reverting those patches.

    The panic happens in hfi1_ipoib_txreq_deinit() because there is a NULL

    hfi1_ipoib_txreq_init() and hfi1_ipoib_rxq_init() are self unwinding so
    fix by adjusting the error paths accordingly.
    
    Other changes:
    - hfi1_ipoib_free_rdma_netdev() is deleted including the free_netdev()
      since the netdev core code deletes calls free_netdev()
    - The switch to the accelerated entrances is moved to the success path.

    block: bio-integrity: Advance seed correctly for larger interval sizes
    
    commit b13e0c71856817fca67159b11abac350e41289f5 upstream.
    
    Commit 309a62fa3a9e ("bio-integrity: bio_integrity_advance must update
    integrity seed") added code to update the integrity seed value when
    advancing a bio. However, it failed to take into account that the
    integrity interval might be larger than the 512-byte block layer
    sector size. This broke bio splitting on PI devices with 4KB logical
    blocks.
    
    The seed value should be advanced by bio_integrity_intervals() and not
    the number of sectors.

    mm/kmemleak: avoid scanning potential huge holes
    
    commit c10a0f877fe007021d70f9cada240f42adc2b5db upstream.
    
    When using devm_request_free_mem_region() and devm_memremap_pages() to
    add ZONE_DEVICE memory, if requested free mem region's end pfn were
    huge(e.g., 0x400000000), the node_end_pfn() will be also huge (see
    move_pfn_range_to_zone()).  Thus it creates a huge hole between
    node_start_pfn() and node_end_pfn().
    
    We found on some AMD APUs, amdkfd requested such a free mem region and
    created a huge hole.  In such a case, following code snippet was just
    doing busy test_bit() looping on the huge hole.
    
      for (pfn = start_pfn; pfn < end_pfn; pfn++) {
            struct page *page = pfn_to_online_page(pfn);
                    if (!page)
                            continue;
            ...
      }
    
    So we got a soft lockup:

    mm/pgtable: define pte_index so that preprocessor could recognize it
    
    commit 314c459a6fe0957b5885fbc65c53d51444092880 upstream.
    
    Since commit 974b9b2c68f3 ("mm: consolidate pte_index() and
    pte_offset_*() definitions") pte_index is a static inline and there is
    no define for it that can be recognized by the preprocessor.  As a
    result, vm_insert_pages() uses slower loop over vm_insert_page() instead
    of insert_pages() that amortizes the cost of spinlock operations when
    inserting multiple pages.

    nvme-fabrics: fix state check in nvmf_ctlr_matches_baseopts()
    
    commit 6a51abdeb259a56d95f13cc67e3a0838bcda0377 upstream.
    
    Controller deletion/reset, immediately followed by or concurrent with
    a reconnect, is hard failing the connect attempt resulting in a
    complete loss of connectivity to the controller.
    
    In the connect request, fabrics looks for an existing controller with
    the same address components and aborts the connect if a controller
    already exists and the duplicate connect option isn't set. The match
    routine filters out controllers that are dead or dying, so they don't
    interfere with the new connect request.
    
    When NVME_CTRL_DELETING_NOIO was added, it missed updating the state
    filters in the nvmf_ctlr_matches_baseopts() routine. Thus, when in this
    new state, it's seen as a live controller and fails the connect request.
    
    Correct by adding the DELETING_NIO state to the match checks.

    drm/amd/display: Force link_rate as LINK_RATE_RBR2 for 2018 15" Apple Retina panels
    
    commit 30fbce374745a9c6af93c775a5ac49a97f822fda upstream.
    
    The eDP link rate reported by the DP_MAX_LINK_RATE dpcd register (0xa) is
    contradictory to the highest rate supported reported by
    EDID (0xc = LINK_RATE_RBR2). The effects of this compounded with commit
    '4a8ca46bae8a ("drm/amd/display: Default max bpc to 16 for eDP")' results
    in no display modes being found and a dark panel.
    
    For now, simply force the maximum supported link rate for the eDP attached
    2018 15" Apple Retina panels.
    
    Additionally, we must also check the firmware revision since the device ID
    reported by the DPCD is identical to that of the more capable 16,1,
    incorrectly quirking it. We also use said firmware check to quirk the
    refreshed 15,1 models with Vega graphics as they use a slightly newer
    firmware version.

    drm/nouveau: fix off by one in BIOS boundary checking
    
    commit 1b777d4d9e383d2744fc9b3a09af6ec1893c8b1a upstream.
    
    Bounds checking when parsing init scripts embedded in the BIOS reject
    access to the last byte. This causes driver initialization to fail on
    Apple eMac's with GeForce 2 MX GPUs, leaving the system with no working
    console.
    
    This is probably only seen on OpenFirmware machines like PowerPC Macs
    because the BIOS image provided by OF is only the used parts of the ROM,
    not a power-of-two blocks read from PCI directly so PCs always have
    empty bytes at the end that are never accessed.

    Revert "fs/9p: search open fids first"
    
    commit 22e424feb6658c5d6789e45121830357809c59cb upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 478ba09edc1f2f2ee27180a06150cb2d1a686f9c.
    
    That commit was meant as a fix for setattrs with by fd (e.g. ftruncate)
    to use an open fid instead of the first fid it found on lookup.
    The proper fix for that is to use the fid associated with the open file
    struct, available in iattr->ia_file for such operations, and was
    actually done just before in 66246641609b ("9p: retrieve fid from file
    when file instance exist.")
    As such, this commit is no longer required.
    
    Furthermore, changing lookup to return open fids first had unwanted side
    effects, as it turns out the protocol forbids the use of open fids for
    further walks (e.g. clone_fid) and we broke mounts for some servers
    enforcing this rule.
    
    Note this only reverts to the old working behaviour, but it's still
    possible for lookup to return open fids if dentry->d_fsdata is not set,
    so more work is needed to make sure we respect this rule in the future,
    for example by adding a flag to the lookup functions to only match
    certain fid open modes depending on caller requirements.

    btrfs: fix use-after-free after failure to create a snapshot
    
    commit 28b21c558a3753171097193b6f6602a94169093a upstream.
    
    At ioctl.c:create_snapshot(), we allocate a pending snapshot structure and
    then attach it to the transaction's list of pending snapshots. After that
    we call btrfs_commit_transaction(), and if that returns an error we jump
    to 'fail' label, where we kfree() the pending snapshot structure. This can
    result in a later use-after-free of the pending snapshot:
    
    1) We allocated the pending snapshot and added it to the transaction's
       list of pending snapshots;
    
    2) We call btrfs_commit_transaction(), and it fails either at the first
       call to btrfs_run_delayed_refs() or btrfs_start_dirty_block_groups().
       In both cases, we don't abort the transaction and we release our
       transaction handle. We jump to the 'fail' label and free the pending
       snapshot structure. We return with the pending snapshot still in the
       transaction's list;
    
    3) Another task commits the transaction. This time there's no error at
       all, and then during the transaction commit it accesses a pointer
       to the pending snapshot structure that the snapshot creation task
       has already freed, resulting in a user-after-free.
    
    This issue could actually be detected by smatch, which produced the
    following warning:
    
      fs/btrfs/ioctl.c:843 create_snapshot() warn: '&pending_snapshot->list' not removed from list
    
    So fix this by not having the snapshot creation ioctl directly add the
    pending snapshot to the transaction's list. Instead add the pending
    snapshot to the transaction handle, and then at btrfs_commit_transaction()
    we add the snapshot to the list only when we can guarantee that any error
    returned after that point will result in a transaction abort, in which
    case the ioctl code can safely free the pending snapshot and no one can
    access it anymore.

    btrfs: fix deadlock between quota disable and qgroup rescan worker
    
    commit e804861bd4e69cc5fe1053eedcb024982dde8e48 upstream.
    
    Quota disable ioctl starts a transaction before waiting for the qgroup
    rescan worker completes. However, this wait can be infinite and results
    in deadlock because of circular dependency among the quota disable
    ioctl, the qgroup rescan worker and the other task with transaction such
    as block group relocation task.
    
    The deadlock happens with the steps following:
    
    1) Task A calls ioctl to disable quota. It starts a transaction and
       waits for qgroup rescan worker completes.
    2) Task B such as block group relocation task starts a transaction and
       joins to the transaction that task A started. Then task B commits to
       the transaction. In this commit, task B waits for a commit by task A.
    3) Task C as the qgroup rescan worker starts its job and starts a
       transaction. In this transaction start, task C waits for completion
       of the transaction that task A started and task B committed.
    
    This deadlock was found with fstests test case btrfs/115 and a zoned
    null_blk device. The test case enables and disables quota, and the
    block group reclaim was triggered during the quota disable by chance.
    The deadlock was also observed by running quota enable and disable in
    parallel with 'btrfs balance' command on regular null_blk devices.
    
    An example report of the deadlock:

      [374.126780] =============================================
    
    To avoid the deadlock, wait for the qgroup rescan worker to complete
    before starting the transaction for the quota disable ioctl. Clear
    BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLE flag before the wait and the transaction to
    request the worker to complete. On transaction start failure, set the
    BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLE flag again. These BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLE flag
    changes can be done safely since the function btrfs_quota_disable is not
    called concurrently because of fs_info->subvol_sem.
    
    Also check the BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLE flag in qgroup_rescan_init to avoid
    another qgroup rescan worker to start after the previous qgroup worker
    completed.

    btrfs: don't start transaction for scrub if the fs is mounted read-only
    
    commit 2d192fc4c1abeb0d04d1c8cd54405ff4a0b0255b upstream.
    
    [BUG]
    The following super simple script would crash btrfs at unmount time, if
    CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT() is set.
    
     mkfs.btrfs -f $dev
     mount $dev $mnt
     xfs_io -f -c "pwrite 0 4k" $mnt/file
     umount $mnt
     mount -r ro $dev $mnt
     btrfs scrub start -Br $mnt
     umount $mnt
    
    This will trigger the following ASSERT() introduced by commit
    0a31daa4b602 ("btrfs: add assertion for empty list of transactions at
    late stage of umount").
    
    That patch is definitely not the cause, it just makes enough noise for
    developers.
    
    [CAUSE]
    We will start transaction for the following call chain during scrub:
    
      scrub_enumerate_chunks()
      |- btrfs_inc_block_group_ro()
         |- btrfs_join_transaction()
    
    However for RO mount, there is no running transaction at all, thus
    btrfs_join_transaction() will start a new transaction.
    
    Furthermore, since it's read-only mount, btrfs_sync_fs() will not call
    btrfs_commit_super() to commit the new but empty transaction.
    
    And leads to the ASSERT().
    
    The bug has been there for a long time. Only the new ASSERT() makes it
    noisy enough to be noticed.
    
    [FIX]
    For read-only scrub on read-only mount, there is no need to start a
    transaction nor to allocate new chunks in btrfs_inc_block_group_ro().
    
    Just do extra read-only mount check in btrfs_inc_block_group_ro(), and
    if it's read-only, skip all chunk allocation and go inc_block_group_ro()
    directly.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix silent output on Gigabyte X570 Aorus Xtreme after reboot from Windows
    
    commit ea3541961376f733373839cc90493aafa8a7f733 upstream.
    
    This commit switches the Gigabyte X570 Aorus Xtreme from using the
    ALC1220_FIXUP_CLEVO_P950 to the ALC1220_FIXUP_GB_X570 quirk. This fixes
    the no-audio after reboot from windows problem.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix silent output on Gigabyte X570S Aorus Master (newer chipset)
    
    commit 41a8601302ecbe704ac970552c33dc942300fc37 upstream.
    
    Newer versions of the X570 Master come with a newer revision of the
    mainboard chipset - the X570S. These boards have the same ALC1220 codec
    but seem to initialize the codec with a different parameter in Coef 0x7
    which causes the output audio to be very low. We therefore write a
    known-good value to Coef 0x7 to fix that. As the value is the exact same
    as on the other X570(non-S) boards the same quirk-function can be shared
    between both generations.
    
    This commit adds the Gigabyte X570S Aorus Master to the list of boards
    using the ALC1220_FIXUP_GB_X570 quirk. This fixes both, the silent output
    and the no-audio after reboot from windows problems.
    
    This work has been tested by the folks over at the level1techs forum here:

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Add missing fixup-model entry for Gigabyte X570 ALC1220 quirks
    
    commit 63394a16086fc2152869d7902621e2525e14bc40 upstream.
    
    The initial commit of the new Gigabyte X570 ALC1220 quirks lacked the
    fixup-model entry in alc882_fixup_models[]. It seemed not to cause any ill
    effects but for completeness sake this commit makes up for that.

    commit 94db9cc8f8fa2d5426ce79ec4ca16028f7084224 upstream.
    
    The ASUS GU603 (Zephyrus M16 - SSID 1043:16b2) requires a quirk similar to
    other ASUS devices for correctly routing the 4 integrated speakers. This
    fixes it by adding a corresponding quirk entry, which connects the bass
    speakers to the proper DAC.

    ALSA: hda: realtek: Fix race at concurrent COEF updates
    
    commit b837a9f5ab3bdfab9233c9f98a6bef717673a3e5 upstream.
    
    The COEF access is done with two steps: setting the index then read or
    write the data.  When multiple COEF accesses are performed
    concurrently, the index and data might be paired unexpectedly.
    In most cases, this isn't a big problem as the COEF setup is done at
    the initialization, but some dynamic changes like the mute LED may hit
    such a race.
    
    For avoiding the racy COEF accesses, this patch introduces a new
    mutex coef_mutex to alc_spec, and wrap the COEF accessing functions
    with it.

    ALSA: hda: Fix UAF of leds class devs at unbinding
    
    commit 549f8ffc7b2f7561bea7f90930b6c5104318e87b upstream.
    
    The LED class devices that are created by HD-audio codec drivers are
    registered via devm_led_classdev_register() and associated with the
    HD-audio codec device.  Unfortunately, it turned out that the devres
    release doesn't work for this case; namely, since the codec resource
    release happens before the devm call chain, it triggers a NULL
    dereference or a UAF for a stale set_brightness_delay callback.
    
    For fixing the bug, this patch changes the LED class device register
    and unregister in a manual manner without devres, keeping the
    instances in hda_gen_spec.

    This device provides both audio and video. The original quirk added in
    commit 48827e1d6af5 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Add quirk for VF0770") used
    USB_DEVICE to match the vendor and product ID. Depending on module order,
    if snd-usb-audio was asked first, it would match the entire device and
    uvcvideo wouldn't get to see it. Change the matching to USB_AUDIO_DEVICE
    to restore uvcvideo matching in all cases.

    commit e4d63473d3110afd170e6e0e48494d3789d26136 upstream.
    
    Some device driver need to communicate to qspi device during the remove
    process, qspi controller must be functional when spi_unregister_master()
    is called.
    
    To ensure this, replace devm_spi_register_master() by spi_register_master()
    and spi_unregister_master() is called directly in .remove callback before
    stopping the qspi controller.
    
    This issue was put in evidence using kernel v5.11 and later
    with a spi-nor which supports the software reset feature introduced
    by commit d73ee7534cc5 ("mtd: spi-nor: core: perform a Soft Reset on

    audit: improve audit queue handling when "audit=1" on cmdline
    
    commit f26d04331360d42dbd6b58448bd98e4edbfbe1c5 upstream.
    
    When an admin enables audit at early boot via the "audit=1" kernel
    command line the audit queue behavior is slightly different; the
    audit subsystem goes to greater lengths to avoid dropping records,
    which unfortunately can result in problems when the audit daemon is
    forcibly stopped for an extended period of time.
    
    This patch makes a number of changes designed to improve the audit
    queuing behavior so that leaving the audit daemon in a stopped state
    for an extended period does not cause a significant impact to the
    system.
    
    - kauditd_send_queue() is now limited to looping through the
      passed queue only once per call.  This not only prevents the
      function from looping indefinitely when records are returned
      to the current queue, it also allows any recovery handling in
      kauditd_thread() to take place when kauditd_send_queue()
      returns.
    
    - Transient netlink send errors seen as -EAGAIN now cause the
      record to be returned to the retry queue instead of going to
      the hold queue.  The intention of the hold queue is to store,
      perhaps for an extended period of time, the events which led
      up to the audit daemon going offline.  The retry queue remains
      a temporary queue intended to protect against transient issues
      between the kernel and the audit daemon.
    
    - The retry queue is now limited by the audit_backlog_limit
      setting, the same as the other queues.  This allows admins
      to bound the size of all of the audit queues on the system.
    
    - kauditd_rehold_skb() now returns records to the end of the
      hold queue to ensure ordering is preserved in the face of
      recent changes to kauditd_send_queue().

    drm/i915: Disable DSB usage for now
    
    commit 99510e1afb4863a225207146bd988064c5fd0629 upstream.
    
    Turns out the DSB has trouble correctly loading the gamma LUT.
    From a cursory look maybe like some entries do not load
    properly, or they get loaded with some gibberish. Unfortunately
    our current kms_color/etc. tests do not seem to catch this.
    
    I had a brief look at the generated DSB batch and it looked
    correct. Tried a few quick tricks like writing the index
    register twice/etc. but didn't see any improvement.
    Also tried switching to the 10bit gamma mode in case
    there is yet another issue with the multi-segment mode, but
    even the 10bit mode was showing issues.
    
    Switching to mmio fixes all of it. I suppose one theory is that
    maybe the DSB bangs on the LUT too quickly and it can't keep up
    and instead some data either gets dropped or corrupted. To confirm
    that someone should try to slow down the DSB's progress a bit.
    Another thought was that maybe the LUT has crappy dual porting
    and you get contention if you try to load it during active
    scanout. But why then would the mmio path work, unless it's
    just sufficiently slow?
    
    Whatever the case, this is currently busted so let's disable
    it until we get to the root of the problem.
