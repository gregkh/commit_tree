    drm/dp_mst: Check if primary mstb is null
    
    commit 23d8003907d094f77cf959228e2248d6db819fa7 upstream.
    
    Unfortunately drm_dp_get_mst_branch_device which is called from both
    drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep and drm_dp_mst_handle_up_rep seem to rely
    on that mgr->mst_primary is not NULL, which seem to be wrong as it can be
    cleared with simultaneous mode set, if probing fails or in other case.
    mgr->lock mutex doesn't protect against that as it might just get
    assigned to NULL right before, not simultaneously.
    
    There are currently bugs 107738, 108616 bugs which crash in
    drm_dp_get_mst_branch_device, caused by this issue.
    
    v2: Refactored the code, as it was nicely noticed.
        Fixed Bugzilla bug numbers(second was 108616, but not 108816)
        and added links.

    drm/rockchip: Allow driver to be shutdown on reboot/kexec
    
    commit 7f3ef5dedb146e3d5063b6845781ad1bb59b92b5 upstream.
    
    Leaving the DRM driver enabled on reboot or kexec has the annoying
    effect of leaving the display generating transactions whilst the
    IOMMU has been shut down.
    
    In turn, the IOMMU driver (which shares its interrupt line with
    the VOP) starts warning either on shutdown or when entering the
    secondary kernel in the kexec case (nothing is expected on that
    front).
    
    A cheap way of ensuring that things are nicely shut down is to
    register a shutdown callback in the platform driver.

    mm: migration: fix migration of huge PMD shared pages
    
    commit 017b1660df89f5fb4bfe66c34e35f7d2031100c7 upstream.
    
    The page migration code employs try_to_unmap() to try and unmap the source
    page.  This is accomplished by using rmap_walk to find all vmas where the
    page is mapped.  This search stops when page mapcount is zero.  For shared
    PMD huge pages, the page map count is always 1 no matter the number of
    mappings.  Shared mappings are tracked via the reference count of the PMD
    page.  Therefore, try_to_unmap stops prematurely and does not completely
    unmap all mappings of the source page.
    
    This problem can result is data corruption as writes to the original
    source page can happen after contents of the page are copied to the target
    page.  Hence, data is lost.
    
    This problem was originally seen as DB corruption of shared global areas
    after a huge page was soft offlined due to ECC memory errors.  DB
    developers noticed they could reproduce the issue by (hotplug) offlining
    memory used to back huge pages.  A simple testcase can reproduce the
    problem by creating a shared PMD mapping (note that this must be at least
    PUD_SIZE in size and PUD_SIZE aligned (1GB on x86)), and using
    migrate_pages() to migrate process pages between nodes while continually
    writing to the huge pages being migrated.
    
    To fix, have the try_to_unmap_one routine check for huge PMD sharing by
    calling huge_pmd_unshare for hugetlbfs huge pages.  If it is a shared
    mapping it will be 'unshared' which removes the page table entry and drops
    the reference on the PMD page.  After this, flush caches and TLB.
    
    mmu notifiers are called before locking page tables, but we can not be
    sure of PMD sharing until page tables are locked.  Therefore, check for
    the possibility of PMD sharing before locking so that notifiers can
    prepare for the worst possible case.

    hugetlbfs: fix kernel BUG at fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:444!
    
    commit 5e41540c8a0f0e98c337dda8b391e5dda0cde7cf upstream.
    
    This bug has been experienced several times by the Oracle DB team.  The
    BUG is in remove_inode_hugepages() as follows:
    
            /*
             * If page is mapped, it was faulted in after being
             * unmapped in caller.  Unmap (again) now after taking
             * the fault mutex.  The mutex will prevent faults
             * until we finish removing the page.
             *
             * This race can only happen in the hole punch case.
             * Getting here in a truncate operation is a bug.
             */
            if (unlikely(page_mapped(page))) {
                    BUG_ON(truncate_op);
    
    In this case, the elevated map count is not the result of a race.
    Rather it was incorrectly incremented as the result of a bug in the huge
    pmd sharing code.  Consider the following:
    
     - Process A maps a hugetlbfs file of sufficient size and alignment
       (PUD_SIZE) that a pmd page could be shared.
    
     - Process B maps the same hugetlbfs file with the same size and
       alignment such that a pmd page is shared.
    
     - Process B then calls mprotect() to change protections for the mapping
       with the shared pmd. As a result, the pmd is 'unshared'.
    
     - Process B then calls mprotect() again to chage protections for the
       mapping back to their original value. pmd remains unshared.
    
     - Process B then forks and process C is created. During the fork
       process, we do dup_mm -> dup_mmap -> copy_page_range to copy page
       tables. Copying page tables for hugetlb mappings is done in the
       routine copy_hugetlb_page_range.
    
    In copy_hugetlb_page_range(), the destination pte is obtained by:
    
            dst_pte = huge_pte_alloc(dst, addr, sz);
    
    If pmd sharing is possible, the returned pointer will be to a pte in an
    existing page table.  In the situation above, process C could share with
    either process A or process B.  Since process A is first in the list,
    the returned pte is a pointer to a pte in process A's page table.
    
    However, the check for pmd sharing in copy_hugetlb_page_range is:
    
            /* If the pagetables are shared don't copy or take references */
            if (dst_pte == src_pte)
                    continue;
    
    Since process C is sharing with process A instead of process B, the
    above test fails.  The code in copy_hugetlb_page_range which follows
    assumes dst_pte points to a huge_pte_none pte.  It copies the pte entry
    from src_pte to dst_pte and increments this map count of the associated
    page.  This is how we end up with an elevated map count.
    
    To solve, check the dst_pte entry for huge_pte_none.  If !none, this
    implies PMD sharing so do not copy.

    configfs: replace strncpy with memcpy
    
    commit 1823342a1f2b47a4e6f5667f67cd28ab6bc4d6cd upstream.

    Using strncpy() is indeed less than perfect since the length of data to

    sunrpc: correct the computation for page_ptr when truncating
    
    commit 5d7a5bcb67c70cbc904057ef52d3fcfeb24420bb upstream.
    
    When truncating the encode buffer, the page_ptr is getting
    advanced, causing the next page to be skipped while encoding.
    The page is still included in the response, so the response
    contains a page of bogus data.
    
    We need to adjust the page_ptr backwards to ensure we encode
    the next page into the correct place.
    
    We saw this triggered when concurrent directory modifications caused
    nfsd4_encode_direct_fattr() to return nfserr_noent, and the resulting
    call to xdr_truncate_encode() corrupted the READDIR reply.

    I tracked this down to put_mnt_ns running passing UMOUNT_SYNC and
    disconnecting all of the mounts in a mount namespace.  Fix this by
    factoring drop_mounts out of drop_collected_mounts and passing
    0 instead of UMOUNT_SYNC.
    
    There are two possible behavior differences that result from this.
    - No longer setting UMOUNT_SYNC will no longer set MNT_SYNC_UMOUNT on
      the vfsmounts being unmounted.  This effects the lazy rcu walk by
      kicking the walk out of rcu mode and forcing it to be a non-lazy
      walk.
    - No longer disconnecting locked mounts will keep some mounts around
      longer as they stay because the are locked to other mounts.
    
    There are only two users of drop_collected mounts: audit_tree.c and
    put_mnt_ns.
    
    In audit_tree.c the mounts are private and there are no rcu lazy walks
    only calls to iterate_mounts. So the changes should have no effect
    except for a small timing effect as the connected mounts are disconnected.
    
    In put_mnt_ns there may be references from process outside the mount
    namespace to the mounts.  So the mounts remaining connected will
    be the bug fix that is needed.  That rcu walks are allowed to continue
    appears not to be a problem especially as the rcu walk change was about
    an implementation detail not about semantics.

    mount: Don't allow copying MNT_UNBINDABLE|MNT_LOCKED mounts
    
    commit df7342b240185d58d3d9665c0bbf0a0f5570ec29 upstream.
    
    Jonathan Calmels from NVIDIA reported that he's able to bypass the
    mount visibility security check in place in the Linux kernel by using
    a combination of the unbindable property along with the private mount
    propagation option to allow a unprivileged user to see a path which
    was purposefully hidden by the root user.
    
    Reproducer:
      # Hide a path to all users using a tmpfs
      root@castiana:~# mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /sys/devices/
      root@castiana:~#
    
      # As an unprivileged user, unshare user namespace and mount namespace
      stgraber@castiana:~$ unshare -U -m -r
    
      # Confirm the path is still not accessible
      root@castiana:~# ls /sys/devices/
    
      # Make /sys recursively unbindable and private
      root@castiana:~# mount --make-runbindable /sys
      root@castiana:~# mount --make-private /sys

    mount: Retest MNT_LOCKED in do_umount
    
    commit 25d202ed820ee347edec0bf3bf553544556bf64b upstream.
    
    It was recently pointed out that the one instance of testing MNT_LOCKED
    outside of the namespace_sem is in ksys_umount.
    
    Fix that by adding a test inside of do_umount with namespace_sem and
    the mount_lock held.  As it helps to fail fails the existing test is
    maintained with an additional comment pointing out that it may be racy
    because the locks are not held.

    commit 9e4028935cca3f9ef9b6a90df9da6f1f94853536 upstream.
    
    Currently bh is set to NULL only during first iteration of for cycle,
    then this pointer is not cleared after end of using.
    Therefore rollback after errors can lead to extra brelse(bh) call,
    decrements bh counter and later trigger an unexpected warning in __brelse()
    
    Patch moves brelse() calls in body of cycle to exclude requirement of
    brelse() call in rollback.

    Add support for platforms where pit_shutdown() doesn't work because of a
    quirk in the PIT emulation. On these platforms setting the counter register
    to zero causes the PIT to start running again, negating the shutdown.
    
    Provide a global variable that controls whether the counter register is
    zero'ed, which platform specific code can override.

    Btrfs: fix data corruption due to cloning of eof block
    
    commit ac765f83f1397646c11092a032d4f62c3d478b81 upstream.
    
    We currently allow cloning a range from a file which includes the last
    block of the file even if the file's size is not aligned to the block
    size. This is fine and useful when the destination file has the same size,
    but when it does not and the range ends somewhere in the middle of the
    destination file, it leads to corruption because the bytes between the EOF
    and the end of the block have undefined data (when there is support for
    discard/trimming they have a value of 0x00).
    
    Example:
    
     $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
     $ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
    
     $ export foo_size=$((256 * 1024 + 100))
     $ xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0x3c 0 $foo_size" /mnt/foo
     $ xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xb5 0 1M" /mnt/bar
    
     $ xfs_io -c "reflink /mnt/foo 0 512K $foo_size" /mnt/bar
    
     $ od -A d -t x1 /mnt/bar
     0000000 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5
     *
     0524288 3c 3c 3c 3c 3c 3c 3c 3c 3c 3c 3c 3c 3c 3c 3c 3c
     *
     0786528 3c 3c 3c 3c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
     0786544 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
     *
     0790528 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5 b5
     *
     1048576
    
    The bytes in the range from 786532 (512Kb + 256Kb + 100 bytes) to 790527
    (512Kb + 256Kb + 4Kb - 1) got corrupted, having now a value of 0x00 instead
    of 0xb5.
    
    This is similar to the problem we had for deduplication that got recently
    fixed by commit de02b9f6bb65 ("Btrfs: fix data corruption when
    deduplicating between different files").
    
    Fix this by not allowing such operations to be performed and return the
    errno -EINVAL to user space. This is what XFS is doing as well at the VFS
    level. This change however now makes us return -EINVAL instead of
    -EOPNOTSUPP for cases where the source range maps to an inline extent and
    the destination range's end is smaller then the destination file's size,
    since the detection of inline extents is done during the actual process of
    dropping file extent items (at __btrfs_drop_extents()). Returning the
    -EINVAL error is done early on and solely based on the input parameters
    (offsets and length) and destination file's size. This makes us consistent
    with XFS and anyone else supporting cloning since this case is now checked
    at a higher level in the VFS and is where the -EINVAL will be returned
    from starting with kernel 4.20 (the VFS changed was introduced in 4.20-rc1
    by commit 07d19dc9fbe9 ("vfs: avoid problematic remapping requests into
    partial EOF block"). So this change is more geared towards stable kernels,
    as it's unlikely the new VFS checks get removed intentionally.
    
    A test case for fstests follows soon, as well as an update to filter
    existing tests that expect -EOPNOTSUPP to accept -EINVAL as well.

    arch/alpha, termios: implement BOTHER, IBSHIFT and termios2
    
    commit d0ffb805b729322626639336986bc83fc2e60871 upstream.
    
    Alpha has had c_ispeed and c_ospeed, but still set speeds in c_cflags
    using arbitrary flags. Because BOTHER is not defined, the general
    Linux code doesn't allow setting arbitrary baud rates, and because
    CBAUDEX == 0, we can have an array overrun of the baud_rate[] table in
    drivers/tty/tty_baudrate.c if (c_cflags & CBAUD) == 037.
    
    Resolve both problems by #defining BOTHER to 037 on Alpha.
    
    However, userspace still needs to know if setting BOTHER is actually
    safe given legacy kernels (does anyone actually care about that on
    Alpha anymore?), so enable the TCGETS2/TCSETS*2 ioctls on Alpha, even
    though they use the same structure. Define struct termios2 just for
    compatibility; it is the exact same structure as struct termios. In a
    future patchset, this will be cleaned up so the uapi headers are
    usable from libc.

    termios, tty/tty_baudrate.c: fix buffer overrun
    
    commit 991a25194097006ec1e0d2e0814ff920e59e3465 upstream.
    
    On architectures with CBAUDEX == 0 (Alpha and PowerPC), the code in tty_baudrate.c does
    not do any limit checking on the tty_baudrate[] array, and in fact a
    buffer overrun is possible on both architectures. Add a limit check to
    prevent that situation.
    
    This will be followed by a much bigger cleanup/simplification patch.

    other users of the BCH library code.
    
    The only other user we have today is the MTD_NAND software BCH
    implementation (most flash controllers use hardware BCH these days
    and are not affected). I considered removing BCH_CONST_PARAMS entirely
    because of the inherent conflict, but according to the description in
    lib/bch.c there is a significant performance benefit in keeping it.
    
    To avoid the immediate problem of the conflict between MTD_NAND_BCH
    and DOCG3, this only sets the constant parameters if MTD_NAND_BCH
    is disabled, which should fix the problem for all cases that
    are affected. This should also work for all stable kernels.
    
    Note that there is only one machine that actually seems to use the
    DOCG3 driver (arch/arm/mach-pxa/mioa701.c), so most users should have
    the driver disabled, but it almost certainly shows up if we wanted
    to test random kernels on machines that use software BCH in MTD.

    mm: thp: relax __GFP_THISNODE for MADV_HUGEPAGE mappings
    
    commit ac5b2c18911ffe95c08d69273917f90212cf5659 upstream.
    
    THP allocation might be really disruptive when allocated on NUMA system
    with the local node full or hard to reclaim.  Stefan has posted an
    allocation stall report on 4.12 based SLES kernel which suggests the
    same issue:
    
      kvm: page allocation stalls for 194572ms, order:9, mode:0x4740ca(__GFP_HIGHMEM|__GFP_IO|__GFP_FS|__GFP_COMP|__GFP_NOMEMALLOC|__GFP_HARDWALL|__GFP_THISNODE|__GFP_MOVABLE|__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM), nodemask=(null)

    The defrag mode is "madvise" and from the above report it is clear that
    the THP has been allocated for MADV_HUGEPAGA vma.
    
    Andrea has identified that the main source of the problem is
    __GFP_THISNODE usage:
    
    : The problem is that direct compaction combined with the NUMA
    : __GFP_THISNODE logic in mempolicy.c is telling reclaim to swap very
    : hard the local node, instead of failing the allocation if there's no
    : THP available in the local node.
    :
    : Such logic was ok until __GFP_THISNODE was added to the THP allocation
    : path even with MPOL_DEFAULT.
    :
    : The idea behind the __GFP_THISNODE addition, is that it is better to
    : provide local memory in PAGE_SIZE units than to use remote NUMA THP
    : backed memory. That largely depends on the remote latency though, on
    : threadrippers for example the overhead is relatively low in my
    : experience.
    :
    : The combination of __GFP_THISNODE and __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM results in
    : extremely slow qemu startup with vfio, if the VM is larger than the
    : size of one host NUMA node. This is because it will try very hard to
    : unsuccessfully swapout get_user_pages pinned pages as result of the
    : __GFP_THISNODE being set, instead of falling back to PAGE_SIZE
    : allocations and instead of trying to allocate THP on other nodes (it
    : would be even worse without vfio type1 GUP pins of course, except it'd
    : be swapping heavily instead).
    
    Fix this by removing __GFP_THISNODE for THP requests which are
    requesting the direct reclaim.  This effectivelly reverts 5265047ac301
    on the grounds that the zone/node reclaim was known to be disruptive due
    to premature reclaim when there was memory free.  While it made sense at
    the time for HPC workloads without NUMA awareness on rare machines, it
    was ultimately harmful in the majority of cases.  The existing behaviour
    is similar, if not as widespare as it applies to a corner case but
    crucially, it cannot be tuned around like zone_reclaim_mode can.  The
    default behaviour should always be to cause the least harm for the
    common case.
    
    If there are specialised use cases out there that want zone_reclaim_mode
    in specific cases, then it can be built on top.  Longterm we should
    consider a memory policy which allows for the node reclaim like behavior
    for the specific memory ranges which would allow a

    This was a severe regression compared to previous kernels that made
    important workloads unusable and it starts when __GFP_THISNODE was
    added to THP allocations under MADV_HUGEPAGE.  It is not a significant
    risk to go to the previous behavior before __GFP_THISNODE was added, it
    worked like that for years.
    
    This was simply an optimization to some lucky workloads that can fit in
    a single node, but it ended up breaking the VM for others that can't
    possibly fit in a single node, so going back is safe.

    ocfs2: fix a misuse a of brelse after failing ocfs2_check_dir_entry
    
    commit 29aa30167a0a2e6045a0d6d2e89d8168132333d5 upstream.
    
    Somehow, file system metadata was corrupted, which causes
    ocfs2_check_dir_entry() to fail in function ocfs2_dir_foreach_blk_el().
    
    According to the original design intention, if above happens we should
    skip the problematic block and continue to retrieve dir entry.  But
    there is obviouse misuse of brelse around related code.
    
    After failure of ocfs2_check_dir_entry(), current code just moves to
    next position and uses the problematic buffer head again and again
    during which the problematic buffer head is released for multiple times.
    I suppose, this a serious issue which is long-lived in ocfs2.  This may
    cause other file systems which is also used in a the same host insane.
    
    So we should also consider about bakcporting this patch into linux
    -stable.

    mach64: fix image corruption due to reading accelerator registers
    
    commit c09bcc91bb94ed91f1391bffcbe294963d605732 upstream.
    
    Reading the registers without waiting for engine idle returns
    unpredictable values. These unpredictable values result in display
    corruption - if atyfb_imageblit reads the content of DP_PIX_WIDTH with the
    bit DP_HOST_TRIPLE_EN set (from previous invocation), the driver would
    never ever clear the bit, resulting in display corruption.
    
    We don't want to wait for idle because it would degrade performance, so
    this patch modifies the driver so that it never reads accelerator
    registers.
    
    HOST_CNTL doesn't have to be read, we can just write it with
    HOST_BYTE_ALIGN because no other part of the driver cares if
    HOST_BYTE_ALIGN is set.
    
    DP_PIX_WIDTH is written in the functions atyfb_copyarea and atyfb_fillrect
    with the default value and in atyfb_imageblit with the value set according
    to the source image data.

    mach64: fix display corruption on big endian machines
    
    commit 3c6c6a7878d00a3ac997a779c5b9861ff25dfcc8 upstream.
    
    The code for manual bit triple is not endian-clean. It builds the variable
    "hostdword" using byte accesses, therefore we must read the variable with
    "le32_to_cpu".
    
    The patch also enables (hardware or software) bit triple only if the image
    is monochrome (image->depth). If we want to blit full-color image, we
    shouldn't use the triple code.

    clk: s2mps11: Fix matching when built as module and DT node contains compatible
    
    commit 8985167ecf57f97061599a155bb9652c84ea4913 upstream.
    
    When driver is built as module and DT node contains clocks compatible
    (e.g. "samsung,s2mps11-clk"), the module will not be autoloaded because
    module aliases won't match.
    
    The modalias from uevent: of:NclocksT<NULL>Csamsung,s2mps11-clk
    The modalias from driver: platform:s2mps11-clk
    
    The devices are instantiated by parent's MFD.  However both Device Tree
    bindings and parent define the compatible for clocks devices.  In case
    of module matching this DT compatible will be used.
    
    The issue will not happen if this is a built-in (no need for module
    matching) or when clocks DT node does not contain compatible (not
    correct from bindings perspective but working for driver).
    
    Note when backporting to stable kernels: adjust the list of device ID
    entries.

    xtensa: fix boot parameters address translation
    
    commit 40dc948f234b73497c3278875eb08a01d5854d3f upstream.
    
    The bootloader may pass physical address of the boot parameters structure
    to the MMUv3 kernel in the register a2. Code in the _SetupMMU block in
    the arch/xtensa/kernel/head.S is supposed to map that physical address to
    the virtual address in the configured virtual memory layout.

    xtensa: make sure bFLT stack is 16 byte aligned
    
    commit 0773495b1f5f1c5e23551843f87b5ff37e7af8f7 upstream.
    
    Xtensa ABI requires stack alignment to be at least 16. In noMMU
    configuration ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN is used to align stack. Make it at
    least 16.
    
    This fixes the following runtime error in noMMU configuration, caused by
    interaction between insufficiently aligned stack and alloca function,
    that results in corruption of on-stack variable in the libc function
    glob:
    
     Caught unhandled exception in 'sh' (pid = 47, pc = 0x02d05d65)
      - should not happen
      EXCCAUSE is 15

    xtensa: add NOTES section to the linker script
    
    commit 4119ba211bc4f1bf638f41e50b7a0f329f58aa16 upstream.
    
    This section collects all source .note.* sections together in the
    vmlinux image. Without it .note.Linux section may be placed at address
    0, while the rest of the kernel is at its normal address, resulting in a
    huge vmlinux.bin image that may not be linked into the xtensa Image.elf.

    MIPS: Loongson-3: Fix BRIDGE irq delivery problem
    
    [ Upstream commit 360fe725f8849aaddc53475fef5d4a0c439b05ae ]
    
    After commit e509bd7da149dc349160 ("genirq: Allow migration of chained
    interrupts by installing default action") Loongson-3 fails at here:
    
    setup_irq(LOONGSON_HT1_IRQ, &cascade_irqaction);
    
    This is because both chained_action and cascade_irqaction don't have
    IRQF_SHARED flag. This will cause Loongson-3 resume fails because HPET
    timer interrupt can't be delivered during S3. So we set the irqchip of
    the chained irq to loongson_irq_chip which doesn't disable the chained
    irq in CP0.Status.

    MIPS: Loongson-3: Fix CPU UART irq delivery problem
    
    [ Upstream commit d06f8a2f1befb5a3d0aa660ab1c05e9b744456ea ]
    
    Masking/unmasking the CPU UART irq in CP0_Status (and redirecting it to
    other CPUs) may cause interrupts be lost, especially in multi-package
    machines (Package-0's UART irq cannot be delivered to others). So make
    mask_loongson_irq() and unmask_loongson_irq() be no-ops.
    
    The original problem (UART IRQ may deliver to any core) is also because
    of masking/unmasking the CPU UART irq in CP0_Status. So it is safe to
    remove all of the stuff.

         entry_SYSENTER_compat+0x70/0x7f
    
    The reason is that the length of the new brk is not page aligned when we
    try to populate the it.  There is no reason to bug on that though.
    do_brk_flags already aligns the length properly so the mapping is
    expanded as it should.  All we need is to tell mm_populate about it.
    Besides that there is absolutely no reason to to bug_on in the first
    place.  The worst thing that could happen is that the last page wouldn't
    get populated and that is far from putting system into an inconsistent
    state.
    
    Fix the issue by moving the length sanitization code from do_brk_flags
    up to vm_brk_flags.  The only other caller of do_brk_flags is brk
    syscall entry and it makes sure to provide the proper length so t here
    is no need for sanitation and so we can use do_brk_flags without it.
    
    Also remove the bogus BUG_ONs.

    binfmt_elf: fix calculations for bss padding
    
    commit 0036d1f7eb95bcc52977f15507f00dd07018e7e2 upstream.
    
    A double-bug exists in the bss calculation code, where an overflow can
    happen in the "last_bss - elf_bss" calculation, but vm_brk internally
    aligns the argument, underflowing it, wrapping back around safe.  We
    shouldn't depend on these bugs staying in sync, so this cleans up the
    bss padding handling to avoid the overflow.
    
    This moves the bss padzero() before the last_bss > elf_bss case, since
    the zero-filling of the ELF_PAGE should have nothing to do with the
    relationship of last_bss and elf_bss: any trailing portion should be
    zeroed, and a zero size is already handled by padzero().
    
    Then it handles the math on elf_bss vs last_bss correctly.  These need
    to both be ELF_PAGE aligned to get the comparison correct, since that's
    the expected granularity of the mappings.  Since elf_bss already had
    alignment-based padding happen in padzero(), the "start" of the new
    vm_brk() should be moved forward as done in the original code.  However,
    since the "end" of the vm_brk() area will already become PAGE_ALIGNed in
    vm_brk() then last_bss should get aligned here to avoid hiding it as a
    side-effect.
    
    Additionally makes a cosmetic change to the initial last_bss calculation
    so it's easier to read in comparison to the load_addr calculation above
    it (i.e.  the only difference is p_filesz vs p_memsz).

    mm, elf: handle vm_brk error
    
    commit ecc2bc8ac03884266cf73f8a2a42b911465b2fbc upstream.
    
    load_elf_library doesn't handle vm_brk failure although nothing really
    indicates it cannot do that because the function is allowed to fail due
    to vm_mmap failures already.  This might be not a problem now but later
    patch will make vm_brk killable (resp.  mmap_sem for write waiting will
    become killable) and so the failure will be more probable.

    Using waitqueue_active() is racy.  Make sure we issue a wake_up()
    unconditionally after storing into fc->blocked.  After that it's okay to
    optimize with waitqueue_active() since the first wake up provides the
    necessary barrier for all waiters, not the just the woken one.

    9p: clear dangling pointers in p9stat_free
    
    [ Upstream commit 62e3941776fea8678bb8120607039410b1b61a65 ]
    
    p9stat_free is more of a cleanup function than a 'free' function as it
    only frees the content of the struct; there are chances of use-after-free
    if it is improperly used (e.g. p9stat_free called twice as it used to be
    possible to)
    
    Clearing dangling pointers makes the function idempotent and safer to use.

    sc16is7xx: Fix for multi-channel stall
    
    [ Upstream commit 8344498721059754e09d30fe255a12dab8fb03ef ]
    
    The SC16IS752 is a dual-channel device. The two channels are largely
    independent, but the IRQ signals are wired together as an open-drain,
    active low signal which will be driven low while either of the
    channels requires attention, which can be for significant periods of
    time until operations complete and the interrupt can be acknowledged.
    In that respect it is should be treated as a true level-sensitive IRQ.
    
    The kernel, however, needs to be able to exit interrupt context in
    order to use I2C or SPI to access the device registers (which may
    involve sleeping).  Therefore the interrupt needs to be masked out or
    paused in some way.
    
    The usual way to manage sleeping from within an interrupt handler
    is to use a threaded interrupt handler - a regular interrupt routine
    does the minimum amount of work needed to triage the interrupt before
    waking the interrupt service thread. If the threaded IRQ is marked as
    IRQF_ONESHOT the kernel will automatically mask out the interrupt
    until the thread runs to completion. The sc16is7xx driver used to
    use a threaded IRQ, but a patch switched to using a kthread_worker
    in order to set realtime priorities on the handler thread and for
    other optimisations. The end result is non-threaded IRQ that
    schedules some work then returns IRQ_HANDLED, making the kernel
    think that all IRQ processing has completed.
    
    The work-around to prevent a constant stream of interrupts is to
    mark the interrupt as edge-sensitive rather than level-sensitive,
    but interpreting an active-low source as a falling-edge source
    requires care to prevent a total cessation of interrupts. Whereas
    an edge-triggering source will generate a new edge for every interrupt
    condition a level-triggering source will keep the signal at the
    interrupting level until it no longer requires attention; in other
    words, the host won't see another edge until all interrupt conditions
    are cleared. It is therefore vital that the interrupt handler does not
    exit with an outstanding interrupt condition, otherwise the kernel
    will not receive another interrupt unless some other operation causes
    the interrupt state on the device to be cleared.
    
    The existing sc16is7xx driver has a very simple interrupt "thread"
    (kthread_work job) that processes interrupts on each channel in turn
    until there are no more. If both channels are active and the first
    channel starts interrupting while the handler for the second channel
    is running then it will not be detected and an IRQ stall ensues. This
    could be handled easily if there was a shared IRQ status register, or
    a convenient way to determine if the IRQ had been deasserted for any
    length of time, but both appear to be lacking.
    
    Avoid this problem (or at least make it much less likely to happen)
    by reducing the granularity of per-channel interrupt processing
    to one condition per iteration, only exiting the overall loop when
    both channels are no longer interrupting.

    powerpc/boot: Ensure _zimage_start is a weak symbol
    
    [ Upstream commit ee9d21b3b3583712029a0db65a4b7c081d08d3b3 ]
    
    When building with clang crt0's _zimage_start is not marked weak, which
    breaks the build when linking the kernel image:
    
     $ objdump -t arch/powerpc/boot/crt0.o |grep _zimage_start$
     0000000000000058 g       .text  0000000000000000 _zimage_start
    
     ld: arch/powerpc/boot/wrapper.a(crt0.o): in function '_zimage_start':
     (.text+0x58): multiple definition of '_zimage_start';
     arch/powerpc/boot/pseries-head.o:(.text+0x0): first defined here
    
    Clang requires the .weak directive to appear after the symbol is
    declared. The binutils manual says:
    
     This directive sets the weak attribute on the comma separated list of
     symbol names. If the symbols do not already exist, they will be
     created.
    
    So it appears this is different with clang. The only reference I could
    see for this was an OpenBSD mailing list post[1].
    
    Changing it to be after the declaration fixes building with Clang, and
    still works with GCC.
    
     $ objdump -t arch/powerpc/boot/crt0.o |grep _zimage_start$
     0000000000000058  w      .text 0000000000000000 _zimage_start

    drm/omap: fix memory barrier bug in DMM driver
    
    [ Upstream commit 538f66ba204944470a653a4cccc5f8befdf97c22 ]
    
    A DMM timeout "timed out waiting for done" has been observed on DRA7
    devices. The timeout happens rarely, and only when the system is under
    heavy load.
    
    Debugging showed that the timeout can be made to happen much more
    frequently by optimizing the DMM driver, so that there's almost no code
    between writing the last DMM descriptors to RAM, and writing to DMM
    register which starts the DMM transaction.
    
    The current theory is that a wmb() does not properly ensure that the
    data written to RAM is observable by all the components in the system.
    
    This DMM timeout has caused interesting (and rare) bugs as the error
    handling was not functioning properly (the error handling has been fixed
    in previous commits):
    
     * If a DMM timeout happened when a GEM buffer was being pinned for
       display on the screen, a timeout error would be shown, but the driver
       would continue programming DSS HW with broken buffer, leading to
       SYNCLOST floods and possible crashes.
    
     * If a DMM timeout happened when other user (say, video decoder) was
       pinning a GEM buffer, a timeout would be shown but if the user
       handled the error properly, no other issues followed.
    
     * If a DMM timeout happened when a GEM buffer was being released, the
       driver does not even notice the error, leading to crashes or hang
       later.
    
    This patch adds wmb() and readl() calls after the last bit is written to
    RAM, which should ensure that the execution proceeds only after the data
    is actually in RAM, and thus observable by DMM.
    
    The read-back should not be needed. Further study is required to understand
    if DMM is somehow special case and read-back is ok, or if DRA7's memory
    barriers do not work correctly.

    powerpc/nohash: fix undefined behaviour when testing page size support
    
    [ Upstream commit f5e284803a7206d43e26f9ffcae5de9626d95e37 ]
    
    When enumerating page size definitions to check hardware support,
    we construct a constant which is (1U << (def->shift - 10)).
    
    However, the array of page size definitions is only initalised for
    various MMU_PAGE_* constants, so it contains a number of 0-initialised
    elements with def->shift == 0. This means we end up shifting by a
    very large number, which gives the following UBSan splat:

    tty: check name length in tty_find_polling_driver()
    
    [ Upstream commit 33a1a7be198657c8ca26ad406c4d2a89b7162bcc ]
    
    The issue is found by a fuzzing test.
    If tty_find_polling_driver() recevies an incorrect input such as
    ',,' or '0b', the len becomes 0 and strncmp() always return 0.
    In this case, a null p->ops->poll_init() is called and it causes a kernel
    panic.
    
    Fix this by checking name length against zero in tty_find_polling_driver().

    btrfs: set max_extent_size properly
    
    commit ad22cf6ea47fa20fbe11ac324a0a15c0a9a4a2a9 upstream.
    
    We can't use entry->bytes if our entry is a bitmap entry, we need to use
    entry->max_extent_size in that case.  Fix up all the logic to make this
    consistent.

    Btrfs: fix null pointer dereference on compressed write path error
    
    commit 3527a018c00e5dbada2f9d7ed5576437b6dd5cfb upstream.
    
    At inode.c:compress_file_range(), under the "free_pages_out" label, we can
    end up dereferencing the "pages" pointer when it has a NULL value. This
    case happens when "start" has a value of 0 and we fail to allocate memory
    for the "pages" pointer. When that happens we jump to the "cont" label and
    then enter the "if (start == 0)" branch where we immediately call the
    cow_file_range_inline() function. If that function returns 0 (success
    creating an inline extent) or an error (like -ENOMEM for example) we jump
    to the "free_pages_out" label and then access "pages[i]" leading to a NULL
    pointer dereference, since "nr_pages" has a value greater than zero at
    that point.
    
    Fix this by setting "nr_pages" to 0 when we fail to allocate memory for
    the "pages" pointer.

    btrfs: qgroup: Dirty all qgroups before rescan
    
    commit 9c7b0c2e8dbfbcd80a71e2cbfe02704f26c185c6 upstream.
    
    [BUG]

      $ mkfs.btrfs -fq $DEV
      $ mount $DEV /mnt
    
      $ btrfs quota enable /mnt
      $ btrfs qgroup create 1/0 /mnt
      $ btrfs sub create /mnt/sub
      $ btrfs qgroup assign 0/257 1/0 /mnt
    
      $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=/mnt/sub/file bs=1k count=1000
      $ btrfs sub snap /mnt/sub /mnt/snap
      $ btrfs quota rescan -w /mnt
      $ btrfs qgroup show -pcre /mnt
      qgroupid         rfer         excl     max_rfer     max_excl parent  child

                 ^^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^ not cleared
    
    [CAUSE]
    Before rescan we call qgroup_rescan_zero_tracking() to zero out all
    qgroups' accounting numbers.
    
    However we don't mark all qgroups dirty, but rely on rescan to do so.
    
    If we have any high level qgroup without children, it won't be marked
    dirty during rescan, since we cannot reach that qgroup.
    
    This will cause QGROUP_INFO items of childless qgroups never get updated
    in the quota tree, thus their numbers will stay the same in "btrfs
    qgroup show" output.
    
    [FIX]
    Just mark all qgroups dirty in qgroup_rescan_zero_tracking(), so even if
    we have childless qgroups, their QGROUP_INFO items will still get
    updated during rescan.

    Btrfs: fix wrong dentries after fsync of file that got its parent replaced
    
    commit 0f375eed92b5a407657532637ed9652611a682f5 upstream.
    
    In a scenario like the following:
    
      mkdir /mnt/A               # inode 258
      mkdir /mnt/B               # inode 259
      touch /mnt/B/bar           # inode 260
    
      sync
    
      mv /mnt/B/bar /mnt/A/bar
      mv -T /mnt/A /mnt/B
      fsync /mnt/B/bar
    
      <power fail>
    
    After replaying the log we end up with file bar having 2 hard links, both
    with the name 'bar' and one in the directory with inode number 258 and the
    other in the directory with inode number 259. Also, we end up with the
    directory inode 259 still existing and with the directory inode 258 still
    named as 'A', instead of 'B'. In this scenario, file 'bar' should only
    have one hard link, located at directory inode 258, the directory inode
    259 should not exist anymore and the name for directory inode 258 should
    be 'B'.
    
    This incorrect behaviour happens because when attempting to log the old
    parents of an inode, we skip any parents that no longer exist. Fix this
    by forcing a full commit if an old parent no longer exists.
    
    A test case for fstests follows soon.

    btrfs: make sure we create all new block groups
    
    commit 545e3366db823dc3342ca9d7fea803f829c9062f upstream.
    
    Allocating new chunks modifies both the extent and chunk tree, which can
    trigger new chunk allocations.  So instead of doing list_for_each_safe,
    just do while (!list_empty()) so we make sure we don't exit with other
    pending bg's still on our list.

    btrfs: reset max_extent_size on clear in a bitmap
    
    commit 553cceb49681d60975d00892877d4c871bf220f9 upstream.
    
    We need to clear the max_extent_size when we clear bits from a bitmap
    since it could have been from the range that contains the
    max_extent_size.

    btrfs: wait on caching when putting the bg cache
    
    commit 3aa7c7a31c26321696b92841d5103461c6f3f517 upstream.
    
    While testing my backport I noticed there was a panic if I ran
    generic/416 generic/417 generic/418 all in a row.  This just happened to
    uncover a race where we had outstanding IO after we destroy all of our
    workqueues, and then we'd go to queue the endio work on those free'd
    workqueues.
    
    This is because we aren't waiting for the caching threads to be done
    before freeing everything up, so to fix this make sure we wait on any
    outstanding caching that's being done before we free up the block group,
    so we're sure to be done with all IO by the time we get to
    btrfs_stop_all_workers().  This fixes the panic I was seeing
    consistently in testing.

    btrfs: don't attempt to trim devices that don't support it
    
    commit 0be88e367fd8fbdb45257615d691f4675dda062f upstream.
    
    We check whether any device the file system is using supports discard in
    the ioctl call, but then we attempt to trim free extents on every device
    regardless of whether discard is supported.  Due to the way we mask off
    EOPNOTSUPP, we can end up issuing the trim operations on each free range
    on devices that don't support it, just wasting time.

    btrfs: iterate all devices during trim, instead of fs_devices::alloc_list
    
    commit d4e329de5e5e21594df2e0dd59da9acee71f133b upstream.
    
    btrfs_trim_fs iterates over the fs_devices->alloc_list while holding the
    device_list_mutex.  The problem is that ->alloc_list is protected by the
    chunk mutex.  We don't want to hold the chunk mutex over the trim of the
    entire file system.  Fortunately, the ->dev_list list is protected by
    the dev_list mutex and while it will give us all devices, including
    read-only devices, we already just skip the read-only devices.  Then we
    can continue to take and release the chunk mutex while scanning each
    device.

    btrfs: locking: Add extra check in btrfs_init_new_buffer() to avoid deadlock
    
    commit b72c3aba09a53fc7c1824250d71180ca154517a7 upstream.
    
    [BUG]
    For certain crafted image, whose csum root leaf has missing backref, if
    we try to trigger write with data csum, it could cause deadlock with the
    following kernel WARN_ON():

       kthread+0x180/0x1d0
       ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40
    
    [CAUSE]
    That crafted image has missing backref for csum tree root leaf.  And
    when we try to allocate new tree block, since there is no
    EXTENT/METADATA_ITEM for csum tree root, btrfs consider it's free slot
    and use it.
    
    The extent tree of the image looks like:
    
      Normal image                      |       This fuzzed image
      ----------------------------------+--------------------------------
      BG 29360128                       | BG 29360128
       One empty slot                   |  One empty slot
      29364224: backref to UUID tree    | 29364224: backref to UUID tree
       Two empty slots                  |  Two empty slots
      29376512: backref to CSUM tree    |  One empty slot (bad type) <<<
      29380608: backref to D_RELOC tree | 29380608: backref to D_RELOC tree
      ...                               | ...
    
    Since bytenr 29376512 has no METADATA/EXTENT_ITEM, when btrfs try to
    alloc tree block, it's an valid slot for btrfs.
    
    And for finish_ordered_write, when we need to insert csum, we try to CoW
    csum tree root.
    
    By accident, empty slots at bytenr BG_OFFSET, BG_OFFSET + 8K,
    BG_OFFSET + 12K is already used by tree block COW for other trees, the
    next empty slot is BG_OFFSET + 16K, which should be the backref for CSUM
    tree.
    
    But due to the bad type, btrfs can recognize it and still consider it as
    an empty slot, and will try to use it for csum tree CoW.
    
    Then in the following call trace, we will try to lock the new tree
    block, which turns out to be the old csum tree root which is already
    locked:
    
    btrfs_search_slot() called on csum tree root, which is at 29376512
    |- btrfs_cow_block()
       |- btrfs_set_lock_block()
       |  |- Now locks tree block 29376512 (old csum tree root)
       |- __btrfs_cow_block()
          |- btrfs_alloc_tree_block()
             |- btrfs_reserve_extent()
                | Now it returns tree block 29376512, which extent tree
                | shows its empty slot, but it's already hold by csum tree
                |- btrfs_init_new_buffer()
                   |- btrfs_tree_lock()
                      | Triggers WARN_ON(eb->lock_owner == current->pid)
                      |- wait_event()
                         Wait lock owner to release the lock, but it's
                         locked by ourself, so it will deadlock
    
    [FIX]
    This patch will do the lock_owner and current->pid check at
    btrfs_init_new_buffer().
    So above deadlock can be avoided.
    
    Since such problem can only happen in crafted image, we will still
    trigger kernel warning for later aborted transaction, but with a little
    more meaningful warning message.

    [CAUSE]
    Extent tree corruption.  In this particular case, reloc tree root's
    owner is DATA_RELOC_TREE (should be TREE_RELOC), thus its backref is
    corrupted and we failed the owner check in walk_up_tree().
    
    [FIX]
    It's pretty hard to take care of every extent tree corruption, but at
    least we can remove such BUG_ON() and exit more gracefully.
    
    And since in this particular image, DATA_RELOC_TREE and TREE_RELOC share
    the same root (which is obviously invalid), we needs to make
    __del_reloc_root() more robust to detect such invalid sharing to avoid
    possible NULL dereference as root->node can be NULL in this case.

    commit 1dc6bd5e39a29453bdcc17348dd2a89f1aa4004e upstream.
    
    Fix child-node lookup during probe, which ended up searching the whole
    device tree depth-first starting at the parent rather than just matching
    on its children.
    
    To make things worse, the parent pmc node could end up being prematurely
    freed as of_find_node_by_name() drops a reference to its first argument.

    commit 8bc1379b82b8e809eef77a9fedbb75c6c297be19 upstream.
    
    Use a separate journal transaction if it turns out that we need to
    convert an inline file to use an data block.  Otherwise we could end
    up failing due to not having journal credits.
    
    This addresses CVE-2018-10883.

    media: em28xx: make v4l2-compliance happier by starting sequence on zero
    
    commit afeaade90db4c5dab93f326d9582be1d5954a198 upstream.
    
    The v4l2-compliance tool complains if a video doesn't start
    with a zero sequence number.
    
    While this shouldn't cause any real problem for apps, let's
    make it happier, in order to better check the v4l2-compliance
    differences before and after patchsets.
    
    This is actually an old issue. It is there since at least its
    videobuf2 conversion, e. g. changeset 3829fadc461 ("[media]
    em28xx: convert to videobuf2"), if VB1 wouldn't suffer from
    the same issue.

    xen: fix xen_qlock_wait()
    
    commit d3132b3860f6cf35ff7609a76bbcdbb814bd027c upstream.
    
    Commit a856531951dc80 ("xen: make xen_qlock_wait() nestable")
    introduced a regression for Xen guests running fully virtualized
    (HVM or PVH mode). The Xen hypervisor wouldn't return from the poll
    hypercall with interrupts disabled in case of an interrupt (for PV
    guests it does).
    
    So instead of disabling interrupts in xen_qlock_wait() use a nesting
    counter to avoid calling xen_clear_irq_pending() in case
    xen_qlock_wait() is nested.

    This is because the TURBOchannel bus driver fails to set the coherent
    DMA mask for devices enumerated.
    
    Set the regular and coherent DMA masks for TURBOchannel devices then,
    observing that the bus protocol supports a 34-bit (16GiB) DMA address
    space, by interpreting the value presented in the address cycle across
    the 32 `ad' lines as a 32-bit word rather than byte address[1].  The
    architectural size of the TURBOchannel DMA address space exceeds the
    maximum amount of RAM any actual TURBOchannel system in existence may
    have, hence both masks are the same.
    
    This removes the warning shown above.

    dm ioctl: harden copy_params()'s copy_from_user() from malicious users
    
    commit 800a7340ab7dd667edf95e74d8e4f23a17e87076 upstream.
    
    In copy_params(), the struct 'dm_ioctl' is first copied from the user
    space buffer 'user' to 'param_kernel' and the field 'data_size' is
    checked against 'minimum_data_size' (size of 'struct dm_ioctl' payload
    up to its 'data' member).  If the check fails, an error code EINVAL will be
    returned.  Otherwise, param_kernel->data_size is used to do a second copy,
    which copies from the same user-space buffer to 'dmi'.  After the second
    copy, only 'dmi->data_size' is checked against 'param_kernel->data_size'.
    Given that the buffer 'user' resides in the user space, a malicious
    user-space process can race to change the content in the buffer between
    the two copies.  This way, the attacker can inject inconsistent data
    into 'dmi' (versus previously validated 'param_kernel').
    
    Fix redundant copying of 'minimum_data_size' from user-space buffer by
    using the first copy stored in 'param_kernel'.  Also remove the
    'data_size' check after the second copy because it is now unnecessary.

    NFSv4.1: Fix the r/wsize checking
    
    commit 943cff67b842839f4f35364ba2db5c2d3f025d94 upstream.
    
    The intention of nfs4_session_set_rwsize() was to cap the r/wsize to the
    buffer sizes negotiated by the CREATE_SESSION. The initial code had a
    bug whereby we would not check the values negotiated by nfs_probe_fsinfo()
    (the assumption being that CREATE_SESSION will always negotiate buffer values
    that are sane w.r.t. the server's preferred r/wsizes) but would only check
    values set by the user in the 'mount' command.
    
    The code was changed in 4.11 to _always_ set the r/wsize, meaning that we
    now never use the server preferred r/wsizes. This is the regression that
    this patch fixes.
    Also rename the function to nfs4_session_limit_rwsize() in order to avoid
    future confusion.

    genirq: Fix race on spurious interrupt detection
    
    commit 746a923b863a1065ef77324e1e43f19b1a3eab5c upstream.
    
    Commit 1e77d0a1ed74 ("genirq: Sanitize spurious interrupt detection of
    threaded irqs") made detection of spurious interrupts work for threaded
    handlers by:
    
    a) incrementing a counter every time the thread returns IRQ_HANDLED, and
    b) checking whether that counter has increased every time the thread is
       woken.
    
    However for oneshot interrupts, the commit unmasks the interrupt before
    incrementing the counter.  If another interrupt occurs right after
    unmasking but before the counter is incremented, that interrupt is
    incorrectly considered spurious:
    
    time
     |  irq_thread()
     |    irq_thread_fn()
     |      action->thread_fn()
     |      irq_finalize_oneshot()
     |        unmask_threaded_irq()            /* interrupt is unmasked */
     |
     |                  /* interrupt fires, incorrectly deemed spurious */
     |
     |    atomic_inc(&desc->threads_handled); /* counter is incremented */
     v
    
    This is observed with a hi3110 CAN controller receiving data at high volume
    (from a separate machine sending with "cangen -g 0 -i -x"): The controller
    signals a huge number of interrupts (hundreds of millions per day) and
    every second there are about a dozen which are deemed spurious.
    
    In theory with high CPU load and the presence of higher priority tasks, the
    number of incorrectly detected spurious interrupts might increase beyond
    the 99,900 threshold and cause disablement of the interrupt.
    
    In practice it just increments the spurious interrupt count. But that can
    cause people to waste time investigating it over and over.
    
    Fix it by moving the accounting before the invocation of
    irq_finalize_oneshot().

    printk: Fix panic caused by passing log_buf_len to command line
    
    commit 277fcdb2cfee38ccdbe07e705dbd4896ba0c9930 upstream.
    
    log_buf_len_setup does not check input argument before passing it to
    simple_strtoull. The argument would be a NULL pointer if "log_buf_len",
    without its value, is set in command line and thus causes the following
    panic.

    smb3: on kerberos mount if server doesn't specify auth type use krb5
    
    commit 926674de6705f0f1dbf29a62fd758d0977f535d6 upstream.
    
    Some servers (e.g. Azure) do not include a spnego blob in the SMB3
    negotiate protocol response, so on kerberos mounts ("sec=krb5")
    we can fail, as we expected the server to list its supported
    auth types (OIDs in the spnego blob in the negprot response).
    Change this so that on krb5 mounts we default to trying krb5 if the
    server doesn't list its supported protocol mechanisms.

    smb3: do not attempt cifs operation in smb3 query info error path
    
    commit 1e77a8c204c9d1b655c61751b8ad0fde22421dbb upstream.
    
    If backupuid mount option is sent, we can incorrectly retry
    (on access denied on query info) with a cifs (FindFirst) operation
    on an smb3 mount which causes the server to force the session close.
    
    We set backup intent on open so no need for this fallback.

    iio: adc: at91: fix wrong channel number in triggered buffer mode
    
    commit aea835f2dc8a682942b859179c49ad1841a6c8b9 upstream.
    
    When channels are registered, the hardware channel number is not the
    actual iio channel number.
    This is because the driver is probed with a certain number of accessible
    channels. Some pins are routed and some not, depending on the description of
    the board in the DT.
    Because of that, channels 0,1,2,3 can correspond to hardware channels
    2,3,4,5 for example.
    In the buffered triggered case, we need to do the translation accordingly.
    Fixed the channel number to stop reading the wrong channel.

    iio: adc: at91: fix acking DRDY irq on simple conversions
    
    commit bc1b45326223e7e890053cf6266357adfa61942d upstream.
    
    When doing simple conversions, the driver did not acknowledge the DRDY irq.
    If this irq status is not acked, it will be left pending, and as soon as a
    trigger is enabled, the irq handler will be called, it doesn't know why
    this status has occurred because no channel is pending, and then it will go
    int a irq loop and board will hang.
    To avoid this situation, read the LCDR after a raw conversion is done.

    kbuild: fix kernel/bounds.c 'W=1' warning
    
    commit 6a32c2469c3fbfee8f25bcd20af647326650a6cf upstream.
    
    Building any configuration with 'make W=1' produces a warning:
    
    kernel/bounds.c:16:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'foo' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
    
    When also passing -Werror, this prevents us from building any other files.
    Nobody ever calls the function, but we can't make it 'static' either
    since we want the compiler output.
    
    Calling it 'main' instead however avoids the warning, because gcc
    does not insist on having a declaration for main.

    hugetlbfs: dirty pages as they are added to pagecache
    
    commit 22146c3ce98962436e401f7b7016a6f664c9ffb5 upstream.
    
    Some test systems were experiencing negative huge page reserve counts and
    incorrect file block counts.  This was traced to /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
    removing clean pages from hugetlbfs file pagecaches.  When non-hugetlbfs
    explicit code removes the pages, the appropriate accounting is not
    performed.
    
    This can be recreated as follows:
     fallocate -l 2M /dev/hugepages/foo
     echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
     fallocate -l 2M /dev/hugepages/foo
     grep -i huge /proc/meminfo
       AnonHugePages:         0 kB
       ShmemHugePages:        0 kB
       HugePages_Total:    2048
       HugePages_Free:     2047
       HugePages_Rsvd:    18446744073709551615
       HugePages_Surp:        0
       Hugepagesize:       2048 kB
       Hugetlb:         4194304 kB
     ls -lsh /dev/hugepages/foo
       4.0M -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2.0M Oct 17 20:05 /dev/hugepages/foo
    
    To address this issue, dirty pages as they are added to pagecache.  This
    can easily be reproduced with fallocate as shown above.  Read faulted
    pages will eventually end up being marked dirty.  But there is a window
    where they are clean and could be impacted by code such as drop_caches.
    So, just dirty them all as they are added to the pagecache.

    assumption that the the thread that opened the file will be in
    existence when the process terminates.   Neither of which are
    guaranteed to be true.
    
    Therefore replace caching the task_struct of the opener with
    pid of the openers thread group id.  All the knowledge of the
    opener is used for is as the target of SIGKILL and a SIGKILL
    will kill the entire process group.
    
    Rename genwqe_force_sig to genwqe_terminate, remove it's unncessary
    signal argument, update it's ownly caller, and use kill_pid
    instead of force_sig.
    
    The work force_sig does in changing signal handling state is not
    relevant to SIGKILL sent as SEND_SIG_PRIV.  The exact same processess
    will be killed just with less work, and less confusion.  The work done
    by force_sig is really only needed for handling syncrhonous
    exceptions.
    
    It will still be possible to cause genwqe_device_remove to wait
    8 seconds by passing a file descriptor to another process but
    the possible user after free is fixed.

    PCI: Add Device IDs for Intel GPU "spurious interrupt" quirk
    
    commit d0c9606b31a21028fb5b753c8ad79626292accfd upstream.
    
    Add Device IDs to the Intel GPU "spurious interrupt" quirk table.
    
    For these devices, unplugging the VGA cable and plugging it in again causes
    spurious interrupts from the IGD.  Linux eventually disables the interrupt,
    but of course that disables any other devices sharing the interrupt.
    
    The theory is that this is a VGA BIOS defect: it should have disabled the
    IGD interrupt but failed to do so.
    
    See f67fd55fa96f ("PCI: Add quirk for still enabled interrupts on Intel
    Sandy Bridge GPUs") and 7c82126a94e6 ("PCI: Add new ID for Intel GPU
    "spurious interrupt" quirk") for some history.
    
    [bhelgaas: See link below for discussion about how to fix this more
    generically instead of adding device IDs for every new Intel GPU.  I hope
    this is the last patch to add device IDs.]

    HID: hiddev: fix potential Spectre v1
    
    commit f11274396a538b31bc010f782e05c2ce3f804c13 upstream.
    
    uref->usage_index can be indirectly controlled by userspace, hence leading
    to a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.
    
    This field is used as an array index by the hiddev_ioctl_usage() function,
    when 'cmd' is either HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX, HIDIOCGUSAGES or
    HIDIOCSUSAGES.
    
    For cmd == HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX case, uref->usage_index is compared to
    field->maxusage and then used as an index to dereference field->usage
    array. The same thing happens to the cmd == HIDIOC{G,S}USAGES cases, where
    uref->usage_index is checked against an array maximum value and then it is
    used as an index in an array.
    
    This is a summary of the HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX case, which matches the
    traditional Spectre V1 first load:
    
            copy_from_user(uref, user_arg, sizeof(*uref))
            if (uref->usage_index >= field->maxusage)
                    goto inval;
            i = field->usage[uref->usage_index].collection_index;
            return i;
    
    This patch fixes this by sanitizing field uref->usage_index before using it
    to index field->usage (HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX) or field->value in
    HIDIOC{G,S}USAGES arrays, thus, avoiding speculation in the first load.

    jbd2: fix use after free in jbd2_log_do_checkpoint()
    
    commit ccd3c4373eacb044eb3832966299d13d2631f66f upstream.
    
    The code cleaning transaction's lists of checkpoint buffers has a bug
    where it increases bh refcount only after releasing
    journal->j_list_lock. Thus the following race is possible:
    
    CPU0                                    CPU1
    jbd2_log_do_checkpoint()

      ...
      while (transaction->t_checkpoint_io_list)
      ...
        if (buffer_locked(bh)) {
    
    <-- IO completes now, buffer gets unlocked -->
    
          spin_unlock(&journal->j_list_lock);
                                                spin_lock(&journal->j_list_lock);
                                                __jbd2_journal_remove_checkpoint(jh);
                                                spin_unlock(&journal->j_list_lock);

    net/ipv4: defensive cipso option parsing
    
    commit 076ed3da0c9b2f88d9157dbe7044a45641ae369e upstream.
    
    commit 40413955ee26 ("Cipso: cipso_v4_optptr enter infinite loop") fixed
    a possible infinite loop in the IP option parsing of CIPSO. The fix
    assumes that ip_options_compile filtered out all zero length options and
    that no other one-byte options beside IPOPT_END and IPOPT_NOOP exist.
    While this assumption currently holds true, add explicit checks for zero
    length and invalid length options to be safe for the future. Even though
    ip_options_compile should have validated the options, the introduction of
    new one-byte options can still confuse this code without the additional
    checks.

    xen: make xen_qlock_wait() nestable
    
    commit a856531951dc8094359dfdac21d59cee5969c18e upstream.
    
    xen_qlock_wait() isn't safe for nested calls due to interrupts. A call
    of xen_qlock_kick() might be ignored in case a deeper nesting level
    was active right before the call of xen_poll_irq():
    
    CPU 1:                                   CPU 2:
    spin_lock(lock1)
                                             spin_lock(lock1)
                                             -> xen_qlock_wait()
                                                -> xen_clear_irq_pending()
                                                Interrupt happens
    spin_unlock(lock1)
    -> xen_qlock_kick(CPU 2)
    spin_lock_irqsave(lock2)
                                             spin_lock_irqsave(lock2)
                                             -> xen_qlock_wait()
                                                -> xen_clear_irq_pending()
                                                   clears kick for lock1
                                                -> xen_poll_irq()
    spin_unlock_irq_restore(lock2)
    -> xen_qlock_kick(CPU 2)
                                                wakes up
                                             spin_unlock_irq_restore(lock2)
                                             IRET
                                               resumes in xen_qlock_wait()
                                               -> xen_poll_irq()
                                               never wakes up
    
    The solution is to disable interrupts in xen_qlock_wait() and not to
    poll for the irq in case xen_qlock_wait() is called in nmi context.

    xen: fix race in xen_qlock_wait()
    
    commit 2ac2a7d4d9ff4e01e36f9c3d116582f6f655ab47 upstream.
    
    In the following situation a vcpu waiting for a lock might not be
    woken up from xen_poll_irq():
    
    CPU 1:                CPU 2:                      CPU 3:
    takes a spinlock
                          tries to get lock
                          -> xen_qlock_wait()
    frees the lock
    -> xen_qlock_kick(cpu2)
                            -> xen_clear_irq_pending()
    
    takes lock again
                                                      tries to get lock
                                                      -> *lock = _Q_SLOW_VAL
                            -> *lock == _Q_SLOW_VAL ?
                            -> xen_poll_irq()
    frees the lock
    -> xen_qlock_kick(cpu3)
    
    And cpu 2 will sleep forever.
    
    This can be avoided easily by modifying xen_qlock_wait() to call
    xen_poll_irq() only if the related irq was not pending and to call
    xen_clear_irq_pending() only if it was pending.

    tpm: Restore functionality to xen vtpm driver.
    
    commit e487a0f52301293152a6f8c4e217f2a11dd808e3 upstream.
    
    Functionality of the xen-tpmfront driver was lost secondary to
    the introduction of xenbus multi-page support in commit ccc9d90a9a8b
    ("xenbus_client: Extend interface to support multi-page ring").
    
    In this commit pointer to location of where the shared page address
    is stored was being passed to the xenbus_grant_ring() function rather
    then the address of the shared page itself. This resulted in a situation
    where the driver would attach to the vtpm-stubdom but any attempt
    to send a command to the stub domain would timeout.
    
    A diagnostic finding for this regression is the following error
    message being generated when the xen-tpmfront driver probes for a
    device:
    
    <3>vtpm vtpm-0: tpm_transmit: tpm_send: error -62
    
    <3>vtpm vtpm-0: A TPM error (-62) occurred attempting to determine
    the timeouts
    
    This fix is relevant to all kernels from 4.1 forward which is the
    release in which multi-page xenbus support was introduced.
    
    Daniel De Graaf formulated the fix by code inspection after the
    regression point was located.

    xen-swiotlb: use actually allocated size on check physical continuous
    
    commit 7250f422da0480d8512b756640f131b9b893ccda upstream.
    
    xen_swiotlb_{alloc,free}_coherent() allocate/free memory based on the
    order of the pages and not size argument (bytes). This is inconsistent with
    range_straddles_page_boundary and memset which use the 'size' value,
    which may lead to not exchanging memory with Xen (range_straddles_page_boundary()
    returned true). And then the call to xen_swiotlb_free_coherent() would
    actually try to exchange the memory with Xen, leading to the kernel
    hitting an BUG (as the hypercall returned an error).
    
    This patch fixes it by making the 'size' variable be of the same size
    as the amount of memory allocated.

    [ Upstream commit 78c9be61c3a5cd9e2439fd27a5ffad73a81958c7 ]
    
    Introduce a new flag, uc_buffer, to indicate that the controller
    requires the non-cached pages for stream buffers, either as a
    chip-specific requirement or specified via snoop=0 option.
    This improves the code-readability.
    
    Also, this patch fixes the incorrect behavior for C-Media chip where
    the stream buffers were never handled as non-cached due to the check
    of driver_type even if you pass snoop=0 option.

    that the driver could only work when probed from devicetree. From now

    signal: Always deliver the kernel's SIGKILL and SIGSTOP to a pid namespace init
    
    [ Upstream commit 3597dfe01d12f570bc739da67f857fd222a3ea66 ]
    
    Instead of playing whack-a-mole and changing SEND_SIG_PRIV to
    SEND_SIG_FORCED throughout the kernel to ensure a pid namespace init
    gets signals sent by the kernel, stop allowing a pid namespace init to
    ignore SIGKILL or SIGSTOP sent by the kernel.  A pid namespace init is
    only supposed to be able to ignore signals sent from itself and
    children with SIG_DFL.

    scsi: lpfc: Correct soft lockup when running mds diagnostics
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ef01a2d95fd62bb4f536e7ce4d5e8e74b97a244 ]
    
    When running an mds diagnostic that passes frames with the switch, soft
    lockups are detected. The driver is in a CQE processing loop and has
    sufficient amount of traffic that it never exits the ring processing routine,
    thus the "lockup".
    
    Cap the number of elements in the work processing routine to 64 elements. This
    ensures that the cpu will be given up and the handler reschedule to process
    additional items.

    uio: ensure class is registered before devices
    
    [ Upstream commit ae61cf5b9913027c6953a79ed3894da4f47061bd ]
    
    When both uio and the uio drivers are built in the kernel, it is possible
    for a driver to register devices before the uio class is registered.
    
    This may result in a NULL pointer dereference later on in
    get_device_parent() when accessing the class glue_dirs spinlock.
    
    The trace looks like that:

            spin_unlock_bh(&ioat_chan->prep_lock);
    
    According to the synchronization rule for the del_timer_sync() function,
    the caller must not hold locks which would prevent completion of the
    timer's handler.
    
    The timer structure has its own lock that manages its synchronization.
    Setting the IOAT_CHAN_DOWN bit should prevent other CPUs from
    trying to use that device anyway, there is probably no need to call
    del_timer_sync() while holding the prep_lock. So the del_timer_sync()
    call is now moved outside of the prep_lock critical section to prevent
    the circular lock dependency.

    MD: fix invalid stored role for a disk
    
    [ Upstream commit d595567dc4f0c1d90685ec1e2e296e2cad2643ac ]
    
    If we change the number of array's device after device is removed from array,
    then add the device back to array, we can see that device is added as active
    role instead of spare which we expected.
    
    Please see the below link for details:
    https://marc.info/?l=linux-raid&m=153736982015076&w=2
    
    This is caused by that we prefer to use device's previous role which is
    recorded by saved_raid_disk, but we should respect the new number of
    conf->raid_disks since it could be changed after device is removed.

    looping until the block number wraps all the away around.  This takes
    long enough that if there are multiple threads trying to do pound on
    an the same inode doing non-sensical things, it can end up triggering
    the kernel's soft lockup detector.

    tpm: suppress transmit cmd error logs when TPM 1.2 is disabled/deactivated
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d6d0d62d9505a9816716aa484ebd0b04c795063 ]
    
    For TPM 1.2 chips the system setup utility allows to set the TPM device in
    one of the following states:
    
      * Active: Security chip is functional
      * Inactive: Security chip is visible, but is not functional
      * Disabled: Security chip is hidden and is not functional
    
    When choosing the "Inactive" state, the TPM 1.2 device is enumerated and
    registered, but sending TPM commands fail with either TPM_DEACTIVATED or
    TPM_DISABLED depending if the firmware deactivated or disabled the TPM.
    
    Since these TPM 1.2 error codes don't have special treatment, inactivating
    the TPM leads to a very noisy kernel log buffer that shows messages like
    the following:
    
      tpm_tis 00:05: 1.2 TPM (device-id 0x0, rev-id 78)
      tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting to read a pcr value
      tpm tpm0: TPM is disabled/deactivated (0x6)
      tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
      tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting to read a pcr value
      ima: No TPM chip found, activating TPM-bypass! (rc=6)
      tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
      tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
      tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
      tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
    
    Let's just suppress error log messages for the TPM_{DEACTIVATED,DISABLED}
    return codes, since this is expected when the TPM 1.2 is set to Inactive.
    
    In that case the kernel log is cleaner and less confusing for users, i.e:
    
      tpm_tis 00:05: 1.2 TPM (device-id 0x0, rev-id 78)
      tpm tpm0: TPM is disabled/deactivated (0x6)
      ima: No TPM chip found, activating TPM-bypass! (rc=6)

    scsi: megaraid_sas: fix a missing-check bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 47db7873136a9c57c45390a53b57019cf73c8259 ]
    
    In megasas_mgmt_compat_ioctl_fw(), to handle the structure
    compat_megasas_iocpacket 'cioc', a user-space structure megasas_iocpacket
    'ioc' is allocated before megasas_mgmt_ioctl_fw() is invoked to handle
    the packet. Since the two data structures have different fields, the data
    is copied from 'cioc' to 'ioc' field by field. In the copy process,
    'sense_ptr' is prepared if the field 'sense_len' is not null, because it
    will be used in megasas_mgmt_ioctl_fw(). To prepare 'sense_ptr', the
    user-space data 'ioc->sense_off' and 'cioc->sense_off' are copied and
    saved to kernel-space variables 'local_sense_off' and 'user_sense_off'
    respectively. Given that 'ioc->sense_off' is also copied from
    'cioc->sense_off', 'local_sense_off' and 'user_sense_off' should have the
    same value. However, 'cioc' is in the user space and a malicious user can
    race to change the value of 'cioc->sense_off' after it is copied to
    'ioc->sense_off' but before it is copied to 'user_sense_off'. By doing
    so, the attacker can inject different values into 'local_sense_off' and
    'user_sense_off'. This can cause undefined behavior in the following
    execution, because the two variables are supposed to be same.
    
    This patch enforces a check on the two kernel variables 'local_sense_off'
    and 'user_sense_off' to make sure they are the same after the copy. In
    case they are not, an error code EINVAL will be returned.

    scsi: esp_scsi: Track residual for PIO transfers
    
    [ Upstream commit fd47d919d0c336e7c22862b51ee94927ffea227a ]
    
    If a target disconnects during a PIO data transfer the command may fail
    when the target reconnects:
    
    scsi host1: DMA length is zero!
    scsi host1: cur adr[04380000] len[00000000]
    
    The scsi bus is then reset. This happens because the residual reached
    zero before the transfer was completed.
    
    The usual residual calculation relies on the Transfer Count registers.
    That works for DMA transfers but not for PIO transfers. Fix the problem
    by storing the PIO transfer residual and using that to correctly
    calculate bytes_sent.

    ath10k: schedule hardware restart if WMI command times out
    
    [ Upstream commit a9911937e7d332761e8c4fcbc7ba0426bdc3956f ]
    
    When running in AP mode, ath10k sometimes suffers from TX credit
    starvation. The issue is hard to reproduce and shows up once in a
    few days, but has been repeatedly seen with QCA9882 and a large
    range of firmwares, including 10.2.4.70.67.
    
    Once the module is in this state, TX credits are never replenished,
    which results in "SWBA overrun" errors, as no beacons can be sent.
    Even worse, WMI commands run in a timeout while holding the conf
    mutex for three seconds each, making any further operations slow
    and the whole system unresponsive.
    
    The firmware/driver never recovers from that state automatically,
    and triggering TX flush or warm restarts won't work over WMI. So
    issue a hardware restart if a WMI command times out due to missing
    TX credits. This implies a connectivity outage of about 1.4s in AP
    mode, but brings back the interface and the whole system to a usable
    state. WMI command timeouts have not been seen in absent of this
    specific issue, so taking such drastic actions seems legitimate.

    pinctrl: ssbi-gpio: Fix pm8xxx_pin_config_get() to be compliant

    problem.  Let's fix it there too.

    pinctrl: spmi-mpp: Fix pmic_mpp_config_get() to be compliant
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d5b476f8f57fcb06c45fe27681ac47254f63fd2 ]
    
    If you look at "pinconf-groups" in debugfs for ssbi-mpp you'll notice
    it looks like nonsense.
    
    The problem is fairly well described in commit 1cf86bc21257 ("pinctrl:

    compliant"), but it was pointed out that ssbi-mpp has the same
    problem.  Let's fix it there too.
    
    NOTE: in case it's helpful to someone reading this, the way to tell
    whether to do the -EINVAL or not is to look at the PCONFDUMP for a
    given attribute.  If the last element (has_arg) is false then you need
    to do the -EINVAL trick.
    
    ALSO NOTE: it seems unlikely that the values returned when we try to
    get PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_PULL_UP will actually be printed since "has_arg"
    is false for that one, but I guess it's still fine to return different
    values so I kept doing that.  It seems like another driver (ssbi-gpio)
    uses a custom attribute (PM8XXX_QCOM_PULL_UP_STRENGTH) for something
    similar so maybe a future change should do that here too.

    ACPI / LPSS: Add alternative ACPI HIDs for Cherry Trail DMA controllers
    
    [ Upstream commit 240714061c58e6b1abfb3322398a7634151c06cb ]
    
    Bay and Cherry Trail DSTDs represent a different set of devices depending
    on which OS the device think it is booting. One set of decices for Windows
    and another set of devices for Android which targets the Android-x86 Linux
    kernel fork (which e.g. used to have its own display driver instead of
    using the i915 driver).
    
    Which set of devices we are actually going to get is out of our control,
    this is controlled by the ACPI OSID variable, which gets either set through
    an EFI setup option, or sometimes is autodetected. So we need to support
    both.
    
    This commit adds support for the 80862286 and 808622C0 ACPI HIDs which we
    get for the first resp. second DMA controller on Cherry Trail devices when
    OSID is set to Android.

    x86: boot: Fix EFI stub alignment
    
    [ Upstream commit 9c1442a9d039a1a3302fa93e9a11001c5f23b624 ]
    
    We currently align the end of the compressed image to a multiple of
    16.  However, the PE-COFF header included in the EFI stub says that
    the file alignment is 32 bytes, and when adding an EFI signature to
    the file it must first be padded to this alignment.
    
    sbsigntool commands warn about this:
    
      warning: file-aligned section .text extends beyond end of file
      warning: checksum areas are greater than image size. Invalid section table?
    
    Worse, pesign -at least when creating a detached signature- uses the
    hash of the unpadded file, resulting in an invalid signature if
    padding is required.
    
    Avoid both these problems by increasing alignment to 32 bytes when
    CONFIG_EFI_STUB is enabled.

    This device reports SDHCI_CLOCK_INT_STABLE even though it's not
    ready to take SDHCI_CLOCK_CARD_EN. The symptom is that reading
    SDHCI_CLOCK_CONTROL after enabling the clock shows absence of the
    bit from the register (e.g. expecting 0x0000fa07 = 0x0000fa03 |
    SDHCI_CLOCK_CARD_EN but only observed the first operand).

    tun: Consistently configure generic netdev params via rtnetlink
    
    [ Upstream commit df52eab23d703142c766ac00bdb8db19d71238d0 ]
    
    Configuring generic network device parameters on tun will fail in
    presence of IFLA_INFO_KIND attribute in IFLA_LINKINFO nested attribute
    since tun_validate() always return failure.
    
    This can be visualized with following ip-link(8) command sequences:
    
      # ip link set dev tun0 group 100
      # ip link set dev tun0 group 100 type tun
      RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
    
    with contrast to dummy and veth drivers:
    
      # ip link set dev dummy0 group 100
      # ip link set dev dummy0 type dummy
    
      # ip link set dev veth0 group 100
      # ip link set dev veth0 group 100 type veth
    
    Fix by returning zero in tun_validate() when @data is NULL that is
    always in case since rtnl_link_ops->maxtype is zero in tun driver.

    locking/lockdep: Fix debug_locks off performance problem
    
    [ Upstream commit 9506a7425b094d2f1d9c877ed5a78f416669269b ]
    
    It was found that when debug_locks was turned off because of a problem
    found by the lockdep code, the system performance could drop quite
    significantly when the lock_stat code was also configured into the
    kernel. For instance, parallel kernel build time on a 4-socket x86-64
    server nearly doubled.
    
    Further analysis into the cause of the slowdown traced back to the
    frequent call to debug_locks_off() from the __lock_acquired() function
    probably due to some inconsistent lockdep states with debug_locks
    off. The debug_locks_off() function did an unconditional atomic xchg
    to write a 0 value into debug_locks which had already been set to 0.
    This led to severe cacheline contention in the cacheline that held
    debug_locks.  As debug_locks is being referenced in quite a few different
    places in the kernel, this greatly slow down the system performance.
    
    To prevent that trashing of debug_locks cacheline, lock_acquired()
    and lock_contended() now checks the state of debug_locks before
    proceeding. The debug_locks_off() function is also modified to check
    debug_locks before calling __debug_locks_off().

    net: qla3xxx: Remove overflowing shift statement
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c3bf9b62b667456a57aefcf1689e826df146159 ]
    
    Clang currently warns:
    
    drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qla3xxx.c:384:24: warning: signed shift
    result (0xF00000000) requires 37 bits to represent, but 'int' only has
    32 bits [-Wshift-overflow]
                        ((ISP_NVRAM_MASK << 16) | qdev->eeprom_cmd_data));
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^  ~~
    1 warning generated.
    
    The warning is certainly accurate since ISP_NVRAM_MASK is defined as
    (0x000F << 16) which is then shifted by 16, resulting in 64424509440,
    well above UINT_MAX.
    
    Given that this is the only location in this driver where ISP_NVRAM_MASK
    is shifted again, it seems likely that ISP_NVRAM_MASK was originally
    defined without a shift and during the move of the shift to the
    definition, this statement wasn't properly removed (since ISP_NVRAM_MASK
    is used in the statenent right above this). Only the maintainers can
    confirm this since this statment has been here since the driver was
    first added to the kernel.

    sparc: Fix single-pcr perf event counter management.
    
    [ Upstream commit cfdc3170d214046b9509183fe9b9544dc644d40b ]
    
    It is important to clear the hw->state value for non-stopped events
    when they are added into the PMU.  Otherwise when the event is
    scheduled out, we won't read the counter because HES_UPTODATE is still
    set.  This breaks 'perf stat' and similar use cases, causing all the
    events to show zero.
    
    This worked for multi-pcr because we make explicit sparc_pmu_start()
    calls in calculate_multiple_pcrs().  calculate_single_pcr() doesn't do
    this because the idea there is to accumulate all of the counter
    settings into the single pcr value.  So we have to add explicit
    hw->state handling there.
    
    Like x86, we use the PERF_HES_ARCH bit to track truly stopped events
    so that we don't accidently start them on a reload.
    
    Related to all of this, sparc_pmu_start() is missing a userpage update
    so add it.

    cores).
    
    The problem can be triggered with a v4.9-RT kernel by starting
    
        cyclictest -S -p98 -m  -i2000 -b 200

    5000 times which indicates that the pi_lock can be acquired. CPU1 on the
    other side does not make progress waiting for the same lock with interrupts

    ALSA: ca0106: Disable IZD on SB0570 DAC to fix audio pops
    
    commit ac237c28d5ac1b241d58b1b7b4b9fa10efb22fb5 upstream.
    
    The Creative Audigy SE (SB0570) card currently exhibits an audible pop
    whenever playback is stopped or resumed, or during silent periods of an
    audio stream. Initialise the IZD bit to the 0 to eliminate these pops.
    
    The Infinite Zero Detection (IZD) feature on the DAC causes the output
    to be shunted to Vcap after 2048 samples of silence. This discharges the
    AC coupling capacitor through the output and causes the aforementioned
    pop/click noise.
    
    The behaviour of the IZD bit is described on page 15 of the WM8768GEDS
    datasheet: "With IZD=1, applying MUTE for 1024 consecutive input samples
    will cause all outputs to be connected directly to VCAP. This also
    happens if 2048 consecutive zero input samples are applied to all 6
    channels, and IZD=0. It will be removed as soon as any channel receives
    a non-zero input". I believe the second sentence might be referring to
    IZD=1 instead of IZD=0 given the observed behaviour of the card.
    
    This change should make the DAC initialisation consistent with
    Creative's Windows driver, as this popping persists when initialising
    the card in Linux and soft rebooting into Windows, but is not present on
    a cold boot to Windows.

    parisc: Fix map_pages() to not overwrite existing pte entries
    
    commit 3c229b3f2dd8133f61bb81d3cb018be92f4bba39 upstream.
    
    Fix a long-existing small nasty bug in the map_pages() implementation which
    leads to overwriting already written pte entries with zero, *if* map_pages() is
    called a second time with an end address which isn't aligned on a pmd boundry.
    This happens for example if we want to remap only the text segment read/write
    in order to run alternative patching on the code. Exiting the loop when we
    reach the end address fixes this.

    parisc: Fix address in HPMC IVA
    
    commit 1138b6718ff74d2a934459643e3754423d23b5e2 upstream.
    
    Helge noticed that the address of the os_hpmc handler was not being
    correctly calculated in the hpmc macro.  As a result, PDCE_CHECK would
    fail to call os_hpmc:
    
    <Cpu2> e800009802e00000  0000000000000000  CC_ERR_CHECK_HPMC

    <Cpu2> 030010d502e00000  0000000000000000  CC_CPU_STOP
    
    The address problem can be seen by dumping the fault vector:
    
    0000000040159000 <fault_vector_20>:
        40159000:   63 6f 77 73     stb r15,-2447(dp)

            ...
        40159020:   08 00 02 40     nop
        40159024:   20 6e 60 02     ldil L%15d000,r3
        40159028:   34 63 00 00     ldo 0(r3),r3

        40159030:   08 00 02 40     nop
        40159034:   00 00 00 00     break 0,0
        40159038:   c0 00 70 00     bb,*< r0,sar,40159840 <fault_vector_20+0x840>
        4015903c:   00 00 00 00     break 0,0
    
    Location 40159038 should contain the physical address of os_hpmc:
    
    000000004015d000 <os_hpmc>:
        4015d000:   08 1a 02 43     copy r26,r3
        4015d004:   01 c0 08 a4     mfctl iva,r4
        4015d008:   48 85 00 68     ldw 34(r4),r5
    
    This patch moves the address setup into initialize_ivt to resolve the
    above problem.  I tested the change by dumping the HPMC entry after setup:
    
    0000000040209020:  8000240
    0000000040209024: 206a2004

    pcmcia: Implement CLKRUN protocol disabling for Ricoh bridges
    
    commit 95691e3eddc41da2d1cd3cca51fecdfb46bd85bc upstream.
    
    Currently, "disable_clkrun" yenta_socket module parameter is only
    implemented for TI CardBus bridges.
    Add also an implementation for Ricoh bridges that have the necessary
    setting documented in publicly available datasheets.
    
    Tested on a RL5C476II with a Sunrich C-160 CardBus NIC that doesn't work
    correctly unless the CLKRUN protocol is disabled.
    
    Let's also make it clear in its description that the "disable_clkrun"
    module parameter only works on these two previously mentioned brands of
    CardBus bridges.

    jffs2: free jffs2_sb_info through jffs2_kill_sb()
    
    commit 92e2921f7eee63450a5f953f4b15dc6210219430 upstream.
    
    When an invalid mount option is passed to jffs2, jffs2_parse_options()
    will fail and jffs2_sb_info will be freed, but then jffs2_sb_info will
    be used (use-after-free) and freeed (double-free) in jffs2_kill_sb().
    
    Fix it by removing the buggy invocation of kfree() when getting invalid
    mount options.

    hwmon: (pmbus) Fix page count auto-detection.
    
    commit e7c6a55606b5c46b449d76588968b4d8caae903f upstream.
    
    Devices with compatible="pmbus" field have zero initial page count,
    and pmbus_clear_faults() being called before the page count auto-
    detection does not actually clear faults because it depends on the
    page count. Non-cleared faults in its turn may fail the subsequent
    page count auto-detection.
    
    This patch fixes this problem by calling pmbus_clear_fault_page()
    for currently set page and calling pmbus_clear_faults() after the
    page count was detected.

    bcache: fix miss key refill->end in writeback
    
    commit 2d6cb6edd2c7fb4f40998895bda45006281b1ac5 upstream.
    
    refill->end record the last key of writeback, for example, at the first
    time, keys (1,128K) to (1,1024K) are flush to the backend device, but
    the end key (1,1024K) is not included, since the bellow code:
            if (bkey_cmp(k, refill->end) >= 0) {
                    ret = MAP_DONE;
                    goto out;
            }
    And in the next time when we refill writeback keybuf again, we searched
    key start from (1,1024K), and got a key bigger than it, so the key
    (1,1024K) missed.
    This patch modify the above code, and let the end key to be included to
    the writeback key buffer.
