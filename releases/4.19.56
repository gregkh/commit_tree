    powerpc/mm/64s/hash: Reallocate context ids on fork
    
    commit ca72d88378b2f2444d3ec145dd442d449d3fefbc upstream.
    
    When using the Hash Page Table (HPT) MMU, userspace memory mappings
    are managed at two levels. Firstly in the Linux page tables, much like
    other architectures, and secondly in the SLB (Segment Lookaside
    Buffer) and HPT. It's the SLB and HPT that are actually used by the
    hardware to do translations.
    
    As part of the series adding support for 4PB user virtual address
    space using the hash MMU, we added support for allocating multiple
    "context ids" per process, one for each 512TB chunk of address space.
    These are tracked in an array called extended_id in the mm_context_t
    of a process that has done a mapping above 512TB.
    
    If such a process forks (ie. clone(2) without CLONE_VM set) it's mm is
    copied, including the mm_context_t, and then init_new_context() is
    called to reinitialise parts of the mm_context_t as appropriate to
    separate the address spaces of the two processes.
    
    The key step in ensuring the two processes have separate address
    spaces is to allocate a new context id for the process, this is done
    at the beginning of hash__init_new_context(). If we didn't allocate a
    new context id then the two processes would share mappings as far as
    the SLB and HPT are concerned, even though their Linux page tables
    would be separate.
    
    For mappings above 512TB, which use the extended_id array, we
    neglected to allocate new context ids on fork, meaning the parent and
    child use the same ids and therefore share those mappings even though
    they're supposed to be separate. This can lead to the parent seeing
    writes done by the child, which is essentially memory corruption.
    
    There is an additional exposure which is that if the child process
    exits, all its context ids are freed, including the context ids that
    are still in use by the parent for mappings above 512TB. One or more
    of those ids can then be reallocated to a third process, that process
    can then read/write to the parent's mappings above 512TB. Additionally
    if the freed id is used for the third process's primary context id,
    then the parent is able to read/write to the third process's mappings
    *below* 512TB.
    
    All of these are fundamental failures to enforce separation between
    processes. The only mitigating factor is that the bug only occurs if a
    process creates mappings above 512TB, and most applications still do
    not create such mappings.
    
    Only machines using the hash page table MMU are affected, eg. PowerPC
    970 (G5), PA6T, Power5/6/7/8/9. By default Power9 bare metal machines
    (powernv) use the Radix MMU and are not affected, unless the machine
    has been explicitly booted in HPT mode (using disable_radix on the
    kernel command line). KVM guests on Power9 may be affected if the host
    or guest is configured to use the HPT MMU. LPARs under PowerVM on
    Power9 are affected as they always use the HPT MMU. Kernels built with
    PAGE_SIZE=4K are not affected.
    
    The fix is relatively simple, we need to reallocate context ids for
    all extended mappings on fork.

    x86/resctrl: Don't stop walking closids when a locksetup group is found
    
    commit 87d3aa28f345bea77c396855fa5d5fec4c24461f upstream.
    
    When a new control group is created __init_one_rdt_domain() walks all
    the other closids to calculate the sets of used and unused bits.
    
    If it discovers a pseudo_locksetup group, it breaks out of the loop.  This
    means any later closid doesn't get its used bits added to used_b.  These
    bits will then get set in unused_b, and added to the new control group's
    configuration, even if they were marked as exclusive for a later closid.
    
    When encountering a pseudo_locksetup group, we should continue. This is
    because "a resource group enters 'pseudo-locked' mode after the schemata is
    written while the resource group is in 'pseudo-locksetup' mode." When we
    find a pseudo_locksetup group, its configuration is expected to be
    overwritten, we can skip it.

    mac80211: Do not use stack memory with scatterlist for GMAC
    
    commit a71fd9dac23613d96ba3c05619a8ef4fd6cdf9b9 upstream.
    
    ieee80211_aes_gmac() uses the mic argument directly in sg_set_buf() and
    that does not allow use of stack memory (e.g., BUG_ON() is hit in
    sg_set_buf() with CONFIG_DEBUG_SG). BIP GMAC TX side is fine for this
    since it can use the skb data buffer, but the RX side was using a stack
    variable for deriving the local MIC value to compare against the
    received one.
    
    Fix this by allocating heap memory for the mic buffer.
    
    This was found with hwsim test case ap_cipher_bip_gmac_128 hitting that
    BUG_ON() and kernel panic.

    mac80211: handle deauthentication/disassociation from TDLS peer
    
    commit 79c92ca42b5a3e0ea172ea2ce8df8e125af237da upstream.
    
    When receiving a deauthentication/disassociation frame from a TDLS
    peer, a station should not disconnect the current AP, but only
    disable the current TDLS link if it's enabled.
    
    Without this change, a TDLS issue can be reproduced by following the
    steps as below:
    
    1. STA-1 and STA-2 are connected to AP, bidirection traffic is running
       between STA-1 and STA-2.
    2. Set up TDLS link between STA-1 and STA-2, stay for a while, then
       teardown TDLS link.
    3. Repeat step #2 and monitor the connection between STA and AP.
    
    During the test, one STA may send a deauthentication/disassociation
    frame to another, after TDLS teardown, with reason code 6/7, which
    means: Class 2/3 frame received from nonassociated STA.
    
    On receive this frame, the receiver STA will disconnect the current
    AP and then reconnect. It's not a expected behavior, purpose of this
    frame should be disabling the TDLS link, not the link with AP.

    {nl,mac}80211: allow 4addr AP operation on crypto controlled devices
    
    commit 33d915d9e8ce811d8958915ccd18d71a66c7c495 upstream.
    
    As per the current design, in the case of sw crypto controlled devices,
    it is the device which advertises the support for AP/VLAN iftype based
    on it's ability to tranmsit packets encrypted in software
    (In VLAN functionality, group traffic generated for a specific
    VLAN group is always encrypted in software). Commit db3bdcb9c3ff
    ("mac80211: allow AP_VLAN operation on crypto controlled devices")
    has introduced this change.
    
    Since 4addr AP operation also uses AP/VLAN iftype, this conditional
    way of advertising AP/VLAN support has broken 4addr AP mode operation on
    crypto controlled devices which do not support VLAN functionality.
    
    In the case of ath10k driver, not all firmwares have support for VLAN
    functionality but all can support 4addr AP operation. Because AP/VLAN
    support is not advertised for these devices, 4addr AP operations are
    also blocked.
    
    Fix this by allowing 4addr operation on devices which do not support
    AP/VLAN iftype but can support 4addr AP operation (decision is based on
    the wiphy flag WIPHY_FLAG_4ADDR_AP).

    Bluetooth: Fix regression with minimum encryption key size alignment
    
    commit 693cd8ce3f882524a5d06f7800dd8492411877b3 upstream.
    
    When trying to align the minimum encryption key size requirement for
    Bluetooth connections, it turns out doing this in a central location in
    the HCI connection handling code is not possible.
    
    Original Bluetooth version up to 2.0 used a security model where the
    L2CAP service would enforce authentication and encryption.  Starting
    with Bluetooth 2.1 and Secure Simple Pairing that model has changed into
    that the connection initiator is responsible for providing an encrypted
    ACL link before any L2CAP communication can happen.
    
    Now connecting Bluetooth 2.1 or later devices with Bluetooth 2.0 and
    before devices are causing a regression.  The encryption key size check
    needs to be moved out of the HCI connection handling into the L2CAP
    channel setup.
    
    To achieve this, the current check inside hci_conn_security() has been
    moved into l2cap_check_enc_key_size() helper function and then called
    from four decisions point inside L2CAP to cover all combinations of
    Secure Simple Pairing enabled devices and device using legacy pairing
    and legacy service security model.

    ARM: dts: am57xx-idk: Remove support for voltage switching for SD card
    
    commit 88a748419b84187fd1da05637b8e5928b04a1e06 upstream.
    
    If UHS speed modes are enabled, a compatible SD card switches down to
    1.8V during enumeration. If after this a software reboot/crash takes
    place and on-chip ROM tries to enumerate the SD card, the difference in
    IO voltages (host @ 3.3V and card @ 1.8V) may end up damaging the card.
    
    The fix for this is to have support for power cycling the card in
    hardware (with a PORz/soft-reset line causing a power cycle of the
    card). Since am571x-, am572x- and am574x-idk don't have this
    capability, disable voltage switching for these boards.
    
    The major effect of this is that the maximum supported speed
    mode is now high speed(50 MHz) down from SDR104(200 MHz).

    commit c3c0b70cd3f801bded7a548198ee1c9851a0ca82 upstream.
    
    Update the MMC2_HS200_MANUAL1 iodelay values to match with the latest
    dra76x data manual[1]. The new iodelay values will have better marginality
    and should prevent issues in corner cases.
    
    Also this particular pinctrl-array is using spaces instead of tabs for
    spacing between the values and the comments. Fix this as well.

    ARM: imx: cpuidle-imx6sx: Restrict the SW2ISO increase to i.MX6SX
    
    commit b25af2ff7c07bd19af74e3f64ff82e2880d13d81 upstream.
    
    Since commit 1e434b703248 ("ARM: imx: update the cpu power up timing
    setting on i.mx6sx") some characters loss is noticed on i.MX6ULL UART
    as reported by Christoph Niedermaier.
    
    The intention of such commit was to increase the SW2ISO field for i.MX6SX
    only, but since cpuidle-imx6sx is also used on i.MX6UL/i.MX6ULL this caused
    unintended side effects on other SoCs.
    
    Fix this problem by keeping the original SW2ISO value for i.MX6UL/i.MX6ULL
    and only increase SW2ISO in the i.MX6SX case.

    can: flexcan: fix timeout when set small bitrate
    
    commit 247e5356a709eb49a0d95ff2a7f07dac05c8252c upstream.
    
    Current we can meet timeout issue when setting a small bitrate like
    10000 as follows on i.MX6UL EVK board (ipg clock = 66MHZ, per clock =
    30MHZ):
    
    | root@imx6ul7d:~# ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 10000
    
    A link change request failed with some changes committed already.
    Interface can0 may have been left with an inconsistent configuration,
    please check.
    
    | RTNETLINK answers: Connection timed out
    
    It is caused by calling of flexcan_chip_unfreeze() timeout.
    
    Originally the code is using usleep_range(10, 20) for unfreeze
    operation, but the patch (8badd65 can: flexcan: avoid calling
    usleep_range from interrupt context) changed it into udelay(10) which is
    only a half delay of before, there're also some other delay changes.
    
    After double to FLEXCAN_TIMEOUT_US to 100 can fix the issue.
    
    Meanwhile, Rasmus Villemoes reported that even with a timeout of 100,
    flexcan_probe() fails on the MPC8309, which requires a value of at least
    140 to work reliably. 250 works for everyone.

    Currently, btrfs does not consult seed devices to start readahead. As a
    result, if readahead zone is added to the seed devices, btrfs_reada_wait()
    indefinitely wait for the reada_ctl to finish.
    
    You can reproduce the hung by modifying btrfs/163 to have larger initial

    arm64: Silence gcc warnings about arch ABI drift
    
    [ Upstream commit ebcc5928c5d925b1c8d968d9c89cdb0d0186db17 ]
    
    Since GCC 9, the compiler warns about evolution of the
    platform-specific ABI, in particular relating for the marshaling of
    certain structures involving bitfields.
    
    The kernel is a standalone binary, and of course nobody would be
    so stupid as to expose structs containing bitfields as function
    arguments in ABI.  (Passing a pointer to such a struct, however
    inadvisable, should be unaffected by this change.  perf and various
    drivers rely on that.)
    
    So these warnings do more harm than good: turn them off.
    
    We may miss warnings about future ABI drift, but that's too bad.
    Future ABI breaks of this class will have to be debugged and fixed
    the traditional way unless the compiler evolves finer-grained
    diagnostics.

    hwmon: (pmbus/core) Treat parameters as paged if on multiple pages
    
    [ Upstream commit 4a60570dce658e3f8885bbcf852430b99f65aca5 ]
    
    Some chips have attributes which exist on more than one page but the
    attribute is not presently marked as paged. This causes the attributes
    to be generated with the same label, which makes it impossible for
    userspace to tell them apart.
    
    Marking all such attributes as paged would result in the page suffix
    being added regardless of whether they were present on more than one
    page or not, which might break existing setups. Therefore, we add a
    second check which treats the attribute as paged, even if not marked as
    such, if it is present on multiple pages.

    hwmon: (core) add thermal sensors only if dev->of_node is present
    
    [ Upstream commit c41dd48e21fae3e55b3670ccf2eb562fc1f6a67d ]
    
    Drivers may register to hwmon and request for also registering
    with the thermal subsystem (HWMON_C_REGISTER_TZ). However,
    some of these driver, e.g. marvell phy, may be probed from
    Device Tree or being dynamically allocated, and in the later
    case, it will not have a dev->of_node entry.
    
    Registering with hwmon without the dev->of_node may result in
    different outcomes depending on the device tree, which may
    be a bit misleading. If the device tree blob has no 'thermal-zones'
    node, the *hwmon_device_register*() family functions are going
    to gracefully succeed, because of-thermal,
    *thermal_zone_of_sensor_register() return -ENODEV in this case,
    and the hwmon error path handles this error code as success to
    cover for the case where CONFIG_THERMAL_OF is not set.
    However, if the device tree blob has the 'thermal-zones'
    entry, the *hwmon_device_register*() will always fail on callers
    with no dev->of_node, propagating -EINVAL.
    
    If dev->of_node is not present, calling of-thermal does not
    make sense. For this reason, this patch checks first if the
    device has a of_node before going over the process of registering
    with the thermal subsystem of-thermal interface. And in this case,
    when a caller of *hwmon_device_register*() with HWMON_C_REGISTER_TZ
    and no dev->of_node will still register with hwmon, but not with
    the thermal subsystem. If all the hwmon part bits are in place,
    the registration will succeed.

    s390/qeth: fix VLAN attribute in bridge_hostnotify udev event
    
    [ Upstream commit 335726195e460cb6b3f795b695bfd31f0ea70ef0 ]
    
    Enabling sysfs attribute bridge_hostnotify triggers a series of udev events
    for the MAC addresses of all currently connected peers. In case no VLAN is
    set for a peer, the device reports the corresponding MAC addresses with
    VLAN ID 4096. This currently results in attribute VLAN=4096 for all
    non-VLAN interfaces in the initial series of events after host-notify is
    enabled.
    
    Instead, no VLAN attribute should be reported in the udev event for
    non-VLAN interfaces.
    
    Only the initial events face this issue. For dynamic changes that are
    reported later, the device uses a validity flag.
    
    This also changes the code so that it now sets the VLAN attribute for
    MAC addresses with VID 0. On Linux, no qeth interface will ever be
    registered with VID 0: Linux kernel registers VID 0 on all network
    interfaces initially, but qeth will drop .ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid for VID 0.
    Peers with other OSs could register MACs with VID 0.

    nvmet: fix data_len to 0 for bdev-backed write_zeroes
    
    [ Upstream commit 3562f5d9f21e7779ae442a45197fed6cb247fd22 ]
    
    The WRITE ZEROES command has no data transfer so that we need to
    initialize the struct (nvmet_req *req)->data_len to 0x0.  While
    (nvmet_req *req)->transfer_len is initialized in nvmet_req_init(),
    data_len will be initialized by nowhere which might cause the failure
    with status code NVME_SC_SGL_INVALID_DATA | NVME_SC_DNR randomly.  It's
    because nvmet_req_execute() checks like:
    
            if (unlikely(req->data_len != req->transfer_len)) {
                    req->error_loc = offsetof(struct nvme_common_command, dptr);
                    nvmet_req_complete(req, NVME_SC_SGL_INVALID_DATA | NVME_SC_DNR);
            } else
                    req->execute(req);
    
    This patch fixes req->data_len not to be a randomly assigned by
    initializing it to 0x0 when preparing the command in
    nvmet_bdev_parse_io_cmd().
    
    nvmet_file_parse_io_cmd() which is for file-backed I/O has already
    initialized the data_len field to 0x0, though.

    drm/arm/hdlcd: Allow a bit of clock tolerance
    
    [ Upstream commit 1c810739097fdeb31b393b67a0a1e3d7ffdd9f63 ]
    
    On the Arm Juno platform, the HDLCD pixel clock is constrained to 250KHz
    resolution in order to avoid the tiny System Control Processor spending
    aeons trying to calculate exact PLL coefficients. This means that modes
    like my oddball 1600x1200 with 130.89MHz clock get rejected since the
    rate cannot be matched exactly. In practice, though, this mode works
    quite happily with the clock at 131MHz, so let's relax the check to
    allow a little bit of slop.

    drm/arm/hdlcd: Actually validate CRTC modes
    
    [ Upstream commit b96151edced4edb6a18aa89a5fa02c7066efff45 ]
    
    Rather than allowing any old mode through, then subsequently refusing
    unmatchable clock rates in atomic_check when it's too late to back out
    and pick a different mode, let's do that validation up-front where it
    will cause unsupported modes to be correctly pruned in the first place.
    
    This also eliminates an issue whereby a perceived clock rate of 0 would
    cause atomic disable to fail and prevent the module from being unloaded.

    [ Upstream commit 56cd0aefa475079e9613085b14a0f05037518fed ]
    
    The PERF_EVENT_IOC_PERIOD ioctl command can be used to change the

    previous one has overflowed.

    they are offset if the period has changed.

    [ Upstream commit 62394708f3e01c9f2be6be74eb6305bae1ed924f ]
    
    When non-bridged, non-vlan'ed mv88e6xxx port is moving down, error
    message is logged:
    
    failed to kill vid 0081/0 for device eth_cu_1000_4
    
    This is caused by call from __vlan_vid_del() with vin set to zero, over
    call chain this results into _mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_del() called with
    vid=0, and mv88e6xxx_vtu_get() called from there returns -EINVAL.
    
    On symmetric path moving port up, call goes through
    mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_prepare() that calls mv88e6xxx_port_check_hw_vlan()
    that returns -EOPNOTSUPP for zero vid.
    
    This patch changes mv88e6xxx_vtu_get() to also return -EOPNOTSUPP for
    zero vid, then this error code is explicitly cleared in
    dsa_slave_vlan_rx_kill_vid() and error message is no longer logged.

    IB/hfi1: Insure freeze_work work_struct is canceled on shutdown
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d517353c70bb0818b691ca003afdcb5ee5ea44e ]
    
    By code inspection, the freeze_work is never canceled.
    
    Fix by adding a cancel_work_sync in the shutdown path to insure it is no
    longer running.

    IB/rdmavt: Fix alloc_qpn() WARN_ON()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2abae62a26a265129b364d8c1ef3be55e2c01309 ]
    
    The qpn allocation logic has a WARN_ON() that intends to detect the use of
    an index that will introduce bits in the lower order bits of the QOS bits
    in the QPN.
    
    Unfortunately, it has the following bugs:
    - it misfires when wrapping QPN allocation for non-QOS
    - it doesn't correctly detect low order QOS bits (despite the comment)
    
    The WARN_ON() should not be applied to non-QOS (qos_shift == 1).
    
    Additionally, it SHOULD test the qpn bits per the table below:
    
    2 data VLs:   [qp7, qp6, qp5, qp4, qp3, qp2, qp1] ^
                  [  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0, sc0],  qp bit 1 always 0*
    3-4 data VLs: [qp7, qp6, qp5, qp4, qp3, qp2, qp1] ^
                  [  0,   0,   0,   0,   0, sc1, sc0], qp bits [21] always 0
    5-8 data VLs: [qp7, qp6, qp5, qp4, qp3, qp2, qp1] ^
                  [  0,   0,   0,   0, sc2, sc1, sc0] qp bits [321] always 0
    
    Fix by qualifying the warning for qos_shift > 1 and producing the correct
    mask to insure the above bits are zero without generating a superfluous
    warning.

    [ Upstream commit 89d03b3c126d683f7b2cd5b07178493993d12448 ]
    
    The maximum value of block length is 0xffff, so if the configured transfer length
    is more than 0xffff, that will cause block length overflow to lead a configuration
    error.
    
    Thus we can set block length as the maximum burst length to avoid this issue, since
    the maximum burst length will not be a big value which is more than 0xffff.

    [ Upstream commit 0788611c9a0925c607de536b2449de5ed98ef8df ]
    
    In the unlikely event that axi_desc_get returns a null desc in the
    very first iteration of the while-loop the error exit path ends
    up calling axi_desc_put on a null pointer 'first' and this causes
    a null pointer dereference.  Fix this by adding a null check on
    pointer 'first' before calling axi_desc_put.

    brcmfmac: sdio: Don't tune while the card is off
    
    commit 65dade6044079a5c206fd1803642ff420061417a upstream.
    
    When Broadcom SDIO cards are idled they go to sleep and a whole
    separate subsystem takes over their SDIO communication.  This is the
    Always-On-Subsystem (AOS) and it can't handle tuning requests.
    
    Specifically, as tested on rk3288-veyron-minnie (which reports having
    BCM4354/1 in dmesg), if I force a retune in brcmf_sdio_kso_control()
    when "on = 1" (aka we're transition from sleep to wake) by whacking:
      bus->sdiodev->func1->card->host->need_retune = 1
    ...then I can often see tuning fail.  In this case dw_mmc reports "All
    phases bad!").  Note that I don't get 100% failure, presumably because
    sometimes the card itself has already transitioned away from the AOS
    itself by the time we try to wake it up.  If I force retuning when "on
    = 0" (AKA force retuning right before sending the command to go to
    sleep) then retuning is always OK.
    
    NOTE: we need _both_ this patch and the patch to avoid triggering
    tuning due to CRC errors in the sleep/wake transition, AKA ("brcmfmac:
    sdio: Disable auto-tuning around commands expected to fail").  Though
    both patches handle issues with Broadcom's AOS, the problems are
    distinct:
    1. We want to defer (but not ignore) asynchronous (like
       timer-requested) tuning requests till the card is awake.  However,
       we want to ignore CRC errors during the transition, we don't want
       to queue deferred tuning request.
    2. You could imagine that the AOS could implement retuning but we
       could still get errors while transitioning in and out of the AOS.
       Similarly you could imagine a seamless transition into and out of
       the AOS (with no CRC errors) even if the AOS couldn't handle
       tuning.
    
    ALSO NOTE: presumably there is never a desperate need to retune in
    order to wake up the card, since doing so is impossible.  Luckily the
    only way the card can get into sleep state is if we had a good enough
    tuning to send it the command to put it into sleep, so presumably that
    "good enough" tuning is enough to wake us up, at least with a few
    retries.

    brcmfmac: sdio: Disable auto-tuning around commands expected to fail
    
    commit 2de0b42da263c97d330d276f5ccf7c4470e3324f upstream.
    
    There are certain cases, notably when transitioning between sleep and
    active state, when Broadcom SDIO WiFi cards will produce errors on the
    SDIO bus.  This is evident from the source code where you can see that
    we try commands in a loop until we either get success or we've tried
    too many times.  The comment in the code reinforces this by saying
    "just one write attempt may fail"
    
    Unfortunately these failures sometimes end up causing an "-EILSEQ"
    back to the core which triggers a retuning of the SDIO card and that
    blocks all traffic to the card until it's done.
    
    Let's disable retuning around the commands we expect might fail.

    apparmor: enforce nullbyte at end of tag string
    
    commit 8404d7a674c49278607d19726e0acc0cae299357 upstream.
    
    A packed AppArmor policy contains null-terminated tag strings that are read
    by unpack_nameX(). However, unpack_nameX() uses string functions on them
    without ensuring that they are actually null-terminated, potentially
    leading to out-of-bounds accesses.
    
    Make sure that the tag string is null-terminated before passing it to
    strcmp().

    apparmor: fix PROFILE_MEDIATES for untrusted input
    
    commit 23375b13f98c5464c2b4d15f983cc062940f1f4e upstream.
    
    While commit 11c236b89d7c2 ("apparmor: add a default null dfa") ensure
    every profile has a policy.dfa it does not resize the policy.start[]
    to have entries for every possible start value. Which means
    PROFILE_MEDIATES is not safe to use on untrusted input. Unforunately
    commit b9590ad4c4f2 ("apparmor: remove POLICY_MEDIATES_SAFE") did not
    take into account the start value usage.
    
    The input string in profile_query_cb() is user controlled and is not
    properly checked to be within the limited start[] entries, even worse
    it can't be as userspace policy is allowed to make us of entries types
    the kernel does not know about. This mean usespace can currently cause
    the kernel to access memory up to 240 entries beyond the start array
    bounds.

    iio: temperature: mlx90632 Relax the compatibility check
    
    commit 389fc70b60f534d679aea9a3f05146040ce20d77 upstream.
    
    Register EE_VERSION contains mixture of calibration information and DSP
    version. So far, because calibrations were definite, the driver
    compatibility depended on whole contents, but in the newer production
    process the calibration part changes. Because of that, value in EE_VERSION
    will be changed and to avoid that calibration value is same as DSP version
    the MSB in calibration part was fixed to 1.
    That means existing calibrations (medical and consumer) will now have
    hex values (bits 8 to 15) of 83 and 84 respectively. Driver compatibility
    should be based only on DSP version part of the EE_VERSION (bits 0 to 7)
    register.

    usb: xhci: Don't try to recover an endpoint if port is in error state.
    
    commit b8c3b718087bf7c3c8e388eb1f72ac1108a4926e upstream.
    
    A USB3 device needs to be reset and re-enumarated if the port it
    connects to goes to a error state, with link state inactive.
    
    There is no use in trying to recover failed transactions by resetting
    endpoints at this stage. Tests show that in rare cases, after multiple
    endpoint resets of a roothub port the whole host controller might stop
    completely.
    
    Several retries to recover from transaction error can happen as
    it can take a long time before the hub thread discovers the USB3
    port error and inactive link.
    
    We can't reliably detect the port error from slot or endpoint context
    due to a limitation in xhci, see xhci specs section 4.8.3:
    "There are several cases where the EP State field in the Output
    Endpoint Context may not reflect the current state of an endpoint"
    and
    "Software should maintain an accurate value for EP State, by tracking it
    with an internal variable that is driven by Events and Doorbell accesses"
    
    Same appears to be true for slot state.
    
    set a flag to the corresponding slot if a USB3 roothub port link goes
    inactive to prevent both queueing new URBs and resetting endpoints.

    xhci: detect USB 3.2 capable host controllers correctly
    
    commit ddd57980a0fde30f7b5d14b888a2cc84d01610e8 upstream.
    
    USB 3.2 capability in a host can be detected from the
    xHCI Supported Protocol Capability major and minor revision fields.
    
    If major is 0x3 and minor 0x20 then the host is USB 3.2 capable.
    
    For USB 3.2 capable hosts set the root hub lane count to 2.
    
    The Major Revision and Minor Revision fields contain a BCD version number.
    The value of the Major Revision field is JJh and the value of the Minor
    Revision field is MNh for version JJ.M.N, where JJ = major revision number,
    M - minor version number, N = sub-minor version number,
    e.g. version 3.1 is represented with a value of 0310h.
    
    Also fix the extra whitespace printed out when announcing regular
    SuperSpeed hosts.

    usb: chipidea: udc: workaround for endpoint conflict issue
    
    commit c19dffc0a9511a7d7493ec21019aefd97e9a111b upstream.
    
    An endpoint conflict occurs when the USB is working in device mode
    during an isochronous communication. When the endpointA IN direction
    is an isochronous IN endpoint, and the host sends an IN token to
    endpointA on another device, then the OUT transaction may be missed
    regardless the OUT endpoint number. Generally, this occurs when the
    device is connected to the host through a hub and other devices are
    connected to the same hub.
    
    The affected OUT endpoint can be either control, bulk, isochronous, or
    an interrupt endpoint. After the OUT endpoint is primed, if an IN token
    to the same endpoint number on another device is received, then the OUT
    endpoint may be unprimed (cannot be detected by software), which causes
    this endpoint to no longer respond to the host OUT token, and thus, no
    corresponding interrupt occurs.
    
    There is no good workaround for this issue, the only thing the software
    could do is numbering isochronous IN from the highest endpoint since we
    have observed most of device number endpoint from the lowest.

    scsi: ufs: Avoid runtime suspend possibly being blocked forever
    
    commit 24e2e7a19f7e4b83d0d5189040d997bce3596473 upstream.
    
    UFS runtime suspend can be triggered after pm_runtime_enable() is invoked
    in ufshcd_pltfrm_init(). However if the first runtime suspend is triggered
    before binding ufs_hba structure to ufs device structure via
    platform_set_drvdata(), then UFS runtime suspend will be no longer
    triggered in the future because its dev->power.runtime_error was set in the
    first triggering and does not have any chance to be cleared.
    
    To be more clear, dev->power.runtime_error is set if hba is NULL in
    ufshcd_runtime_suspend() which returns -EINVAL to rpm_callback() where
    dev->power.runtime_error is set as -EINVAL. In this case, any future
    rpm_suspend() for UFS device fails because rpm_check_suspend_allowed()
    fails due to non-zero
    dev->power.runtime_error.
    
    To resolve this issue, make sure the first UFS runtime suspend get valid
    "hba" in ufshcd_runtime_suspend(): Enable UFS runtime PM only after hba is
    successfully bound to UFS device structure.

    mmc: core: Prevent processing SDIO IRQs when the card is suspended
    
    commit 83293386bc95cf5e9f0c0175794455835bd1cb4a upstream.
    
    Processing of SDIO IRQs must obviously be prevented while the card is
    system suspended, otherwise we may end up trying to communicate with an
    uninitialized SDIO card.
    
    Reports throughout the years shows that this is not only a theoretical
    problem, but a real issue. So, let's finally fix this problem, by keeping
    track of the state for the card and bail out before processing the SDIO
    IRQ, in case the card is suspended.

    commit b4c9f938d542d5f88c501744d2d12fad4fd2915f upstream.
    
    We want SDIO drivers to be able to temporarily stop retuning when the
    driver knows that the SDIO card is not in a state where retuning will
    work (maybe because the card is asleep).  We'll move the relevant
    functions to a place where drivers can call them.

    mmc: core: API to temporarily disable retuning for SDIO CRC errors
    
    commit 0a55f4ab9678413a01e740c86e9367ba0c612b36 upstream.
    
    Normally when the MMC core sees an "-EILSEQ" error returned by a host
    controller then it will trigger a retuning of the card.  This is
    generally a good idea.
    
    However, if a command is expected to sometimes cause transfer errors
    then these transfer errors shouldn't cause a re-tuning.  This
    re-tuning will be a needless waste of time.  One example case where a
    transfer is expected to cause errors is when transitioning between
    idle (sometimes referred to as "sleep" in Broadcom code) and active
    state on certain Broadcom WiFi SDIO cards.  Specifically if the card
    was already transitioning between states when the command was sent it
    could cause an error on the SDIO bus.
    
    Let's add an API that the SDIO function drivers can call that will
    temporarily disable the auto-tuning functionality.  Then we can add a
    call to this in the Broadcom WiFi driver and any other driver that
    might have similar needs.
    
    NOTE: this makes the assumption that the card is already tuned well
    enough that it's OK to disable the auto-retuning during one of these
    error-prone situations.  Presumably the driver code performing the
    error-prone transfer knows how to recover / retry from errors.  ...and
    after we can get back to a state where transfers are no longer
    error-prone then we can enable the auto-retuning again.  If we truly
    find ourselves in a case where the card needs to be retuned sometimes
    to handle one of these error-prone transfers then we can always try a
    few transfers first without auto-retuning and then re-try with
    auto-retuning if the first few fail.
    
    Without this change on rk3288-veyron-minnie I periodically see this in
    the logs of a machine just sitting there idle:

    commit 0f7b79a44e7d7dd3ef1f59758c1a341f217ff5e5 upstream.
    
    The O2Micro controller only supports tuning at 4-bits. So the host driver
    needs to change the bus width while tuning and then set it back when done.
    
    There was a bug in the original implementation in that mmc->ios.bus_width
    also wasn't updated. Thus setting the incorrect blocksize in
    sdhci_send_tuning which results in a tuning failure.

    s390/ap: rework assembler functions to use unions for in/out register variables
    
    [ Upstream commit 159491f3b509bd8101199944dc7b0673b881c734 ]
    
    The inline assembler functions ap_aqic() and ap_qact() used two
    variables declared on the very same register. One variable was for
    input only, the other for output. Looks like newer versions of the gcc
    don't like this. Anyway it is a better coding to use one variable
    (which may have a union data type) on one register for input and
    output. So this patch introduces unions and uses only one variable now
    for input and output for GR1 for the PQAP(QACT) and PQAP(QIC)
    invocation.

    s390/jump_label: Use "jdd" constraint on gcc9
    
    [ Upstream commit 146448524bddbf6dfc62de31957e428de001cbda ]
    
    [heiko.carstens@de.ibm.com]:
    -----
    Laura Abbott reported that the kernel doesn't build anymore with gcc 9,
    due to the "X" constraint. Ilya provided the gcc 9 patch "S/390:
    Introduce jdd constraint" which introduces the new "jdd" constraint
    which fixes this.
    -----
    
    The support for section anchors on S/390 introduced in gcc9 has changed
    the behavior of "X" constraint, which can now produce register
    references. Since existing constraints, in particular, "i", do not fit
    the intended use case on S/390, the new machine-specific "jdd"
    constraint was introduced. This patch makes jump labels use "jdd"
    constraint when building with gcc9.

    ovl: detect overlapping layers
    
    [ Upstream commit 146d62e5a5867fbf84490d82455718bfb10fe824 ]
    
    Overlapping overlay layers are not supported and can cause unexpected
    behavior, but overlayfs does not currently check or warn about these
    configurations.
    
    User is not supposed to specify the same directory for upper and
    lower dirs or for different lower layers and user is not supposed to
    specify directories that are descendants of each other for overlay
    layers, but that is exactly what this zysbot repro did:
    
        https://syzkaller.appspot.com/x/repro.syz?x=12c7a94f400000
    
    Moving layer root directories into other layers while overlayfs
    is mounted could also result in unexpected behavior.
    
    This commit places "traps" in the overlay inode hash table.
    Those traps are dummy overlay inodes that are hashed by the layers
    root inodes.
    
    On mount, the hash table trap entries are used to verify that overlay
    layers are not overlapping.  While at it, we also verify that overlay
    layers are not overlapping with directories "in-use" by other overlay
    instances as upperdir/workdir.
    
    On lookup, the trap entries are used to verify that overlay layers
    root inodes have not been moved into other layers after mount.
    
    Some examples:
    
    $ ./run --ov --samefs -s
    ...
    ( mkdir -p base/upper/0/u base/upper/0/w base/lower lower upper mnt

    objtool: Support per-function rodata sections
    
    commit 4a60aa05a0634241ce17f957bf9fb5ac1eed6576 upstream.
    
    Add support for processing switch jump tables in objects with multiple
    .rodata sections, such as those created by '-ffunction-sections' and
    '-fdata-sections'.  Currently, objtool always looks in .rodata for jump
    table information, which results in many "sibling call from callable
    instruction with modified stack frame" warnings with objects compiled
    using those flags.
    
    The fix is comprised of three parts:
    
    1. Flagging all .rodata sections when importing ELF information for
       easier checking later.
    
    2. Keeping a reference to the section each relocation is from in order
       to get the list_head for the other relocations in that section.
    
    3. Finding jump tables by following relocations to .rodata sections,
       rather than always referencing a single global .rodata section.
    
    The patch has been tested without data sections enabled and no
    differences in the resulting orc unwind information were seen.
    
    Note that as objtool adds terminators to end of each .text section the
    unwind information generated between a function+data sections build and
    a normal build aren't directly comparable. Manual inspection suggests
    that objtool is now generating the correct information, or at least
    making more of an effort to do so than it did previously.

    tracing: Silence GCC 9 array bounds warning
    
    commit 0c97bf863efce63d6ab7971dad811601e6171d2f upstream.
    
    Starting with GCC 9, -Warray-bounds detects cases when memset is called
    starting on a member of a struct but the size to be cleared ends up
    writing over further members.
    
    Such a call happens in the trace code to clear, at once, all members
    after and including `seq` on struct trace_iterator:
    
        In function 'memset',
            inlined from 'ftrace_dump' at kernel/trace/trace.c:8914:3:
        ./include/linux/string.h:344:9: warning: '__builtin_memset' offset
        [8505, 8560] from the object at 'iter' is out of the bounds of
        referenced subobject 'seq' with type 'struct trace_seq' at offset
        4368 [-Warray-bounds]
          344 |  return __builtin_memset(p, c, size);
              |         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    In order to avoid GCC complaining about it, we compute the address
    ourselves by adding the offsetof distance instead of referring
    directly to the member.
    
    Since there are two places doing this clear (trace.c and trace_kdb.c),
    take the chance to move the workaround into a single place in
    the internal header.
