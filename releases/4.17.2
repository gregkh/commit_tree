    crypto: vmx - Remove overly verbose printk from AES XTS init
    
    commit 730f23b66095a700e2f0786abda6bca011b31558 upstream.
    
    In p8_aes_xts_init() we do a printk(KERN_INFO ...) to report the
    fallback implementation we're using. However with a slow console this
    can significantly affect the speed of crypto operations. So remove it.

    crypto: vmx - Remove overly verbose printk from AES init routines
    
    commit 1411b5218adbcf1d45ddb260db5553c52e8d917c upstream.
    
    In the vmx AES init routines we do a printk(KERN_INFO ...) to report

    However with a slow console this can significantly affect the speed of

    commit c782a8c43e94ba6c09e9de2d69b5e3a5840ce61c upstream.
    
    After issuing a request an endless loop was used to read the
    completion state from memory which is asynchronously updated
    by the ZIP coprocessor.
    
    Add an upper bound to the retry attempts to prevent a CPU getting stuck
    forever in case of an error. Additionally, add a read memory barrier
    and a small delay between the reading attempts.

    crypto: cavium - Fix fallout from CONFIG_VMAP_STACK
    
    commit 37ff02acaa3d7be87ecb89f198a549ffd3ae2403 upstream.
    
    Enabling virtual mapped kernel stacks breaks the thunderx_zip
    driver. On compression or decompression the executing CPU hangs
    in an endless loop. The reason for this is the usage of __pa
    by the driver which does no longer work for an address that is
    not part of the 1:1 mapping.
    
    The zip driver allocates a result struct on the stack and needs
    to tell the hardware the physical address within this struct
    that is used to signal the completion of the request.
    
    As the hardware gets the wrong address after the broken __pa
    conversion it writes to an arbitrary address. The zip driver then
    waits forever for the completion byte to contain a non-zero value.
    
    Allocating the result struct from 1:1 mapped memory resolves this
    bug.

    crypto: caam/qi - fix IV DMA mapping and updating
    
    commit 3a488aaec6f343b5dc6d94529847a840bbeaf009 upstream.
    
    There are two IV-related issues:
    (1) crypto API does not guarantee to provide an IV buffer that is DMAable,
    thus it's incorrect to DMA map it
    (2) for in-place decryption, since ciphertext is overwritten with
    plaintext, updated IV (req->info) will contain the last block of plaintext
    (instead of the last block of ciphertext)
    
    While these two issues could be fixed separately, it's straightforward
    to fix both in the same time - by using the {ablkcipher,aead}_edesc
    extended descriptor to store the IV that will be fed to the crypto engine;
    this allows for fixing (2) by saving req->src[last_block] in req->info
    directly, i.e. without allocating yet another temporary buffer.
    
    A side effect of the fix is that it's no longer possible to have the IV
    contiguous with req->src or req->dst.
    Code checking for this case is removed.

    tty: pl011: Avoid spuriously stuck-off interrupts
    
    commit 4a7e625ce50412a7711efa0f2ef0b96ce3826759 upstream.
    
    Commit 9b96fbacda34 ("serial: PL011: clear pending interrupts")
    clears the RX and receive timeout interrupts on pl011 startup, to
    avoid a screaming-interrupt scenario that can occur when the
    firmware or bootloader leaves these interrupts asserted.
    
    This has been noted as an issue when running Linux on qemu [1].
    
    Unfortunately, the above fix seems to lead to potential
    misbehaviour if the RX FIFO interrupt is asserted _non_ spuriously
    on driver startup, if the RX FIFO is also already full to the
    trigger level.
    
    Clearing the RX FIFO interrupt does not change the FIFO fill level.
    In this scenario, because the interrupt is now clear and because
    the FIFO is already full to the trigger level, no new assertion of
    the RX FIFO interrupt can occur unless the FIFO is drained back
    below the trigger level.  This never occurs because the pl011
    driver is waiting for an RX FIFO interrupt to tell it that there is
    something to read, and does not read the FIFO at all until that
    interrupt occurs.
    
    Thus, simply clearing "spurious" interrupts on startup may be
    misguided, since there is no way to be sure that the interrupts are
    truly spurious, and things can go wrong if they are not.
    
    This patch instead clears the interrupt condition by draining the
    RX FIFO during UART startup, after clearing any potentially
    spurious interrupt.  This should ensure that an interrupt will
    definitely be asserted if the RX FIFO subsequently becomes
    sufficiently full.
    
    The drain is done at the point of enabling interrupts only.  This
    means that it will occur any time the UART is newly opened through
    the tty layer.  It will not apply to polled-mode use of the UART by
    kgdboc: since that scenario cannot use interrupts by design, this
    should not matter.  kgdboc will interact badly with "normal" use of
    the UART in any case: this patch makes no attempt to paper over
    such issues.
    
    This patch does not attempt to address the case where the RX FIFO
    fills faster than it can be drained: that is a pathological
    hardware design problem that is beyond the scope of the driver to
    work around.  As a failsafe, the number of poll iterations for
    draining the FIFO is limited to twice the FIFO size.  This will
    ensure that the kernel at least boots even if it is impossible to
    drain the FIFO for some reason.

    before enabled the interruption

    Recently kernelCI reported the board mt7622-rfb1 has a fail test with

    The cause is that UART0 can't output anything when it's missing a proper

    points to the page that is about to be (un)locked.
    
    Unfortunately, this dual-purpose of the field introduced a bug: when the
    balloon is popped (e.g., when the machine is reset or the balloon driver
    is explicitly removed), the balloon driver frees, unconditionally, the
    page that is held in balloon.page.  As a result, if batching is
    disabled, this leads to double freeing the last page that is sent to the
    hypervisor.
    
    The following error occurs during rmmod when kernel checkers are on, and
    the balloon is not empty:

    serial: 8250: omap: Fix idling of clocks for unused uarts
    
    commit 13dc04d0e5fdc25c8f713ad23fdce51cf2bf96ba upstream.
    
    I noticed that unused UARTs won't necessarily idle properly always
    unless at least one byte tx transfer is done first.
    
    After some debugging I narrowed down the problem to the scr register
    dma configuration bits that need to be set before softreset for the
    clocks to idle. Unless we do this, the module clkctrl idlest bits
    may be set to 1 instead of 3 meaning the clock will never idle and
    is blocking deeper idle states for the whole domain.
    
    This might be related to the configuration done by the bootloader
    or kexec booting where certain configurations cause the 8250 or
    the clkctrl clock to jam in a way where setting of the scr bits
    and reset is needed to clear it. I've tried diffing the 8250
    registers for the various modes, but did not see anything specific.
    So far I've only seen this on omap4 but I'm suspecting this might
    also happen on the other clkctrl using SoCs considering they
    already have a quirk enabled for UART_ERRATA_CLOCK_DISABLE.
    
    Let's fix the issue by configuring scr before reset for basic dma
    even if we don't use it. The scr register will be reset when we do
    softreset few lines after, and we restore scr on resume. We should
    do this for all the SoCs with UART_ERRATA_CLOCK_DISABLE quirk flag
    set since the ones with UART_ERRATA_CLOCK_DISABLE are all based
    using clkctrl similar to omap4.
    
    Looks like both OMAP_UART_SCR_DMAMODE_1 | OMAP_UART_SCR_DMAMODE_CTL
    bits are needed for the clkctrl to idle after a softreset.
    
    And we need to add omap4 to also use the UART_ERRATA_CLOCK_DISABLE
    for the related workaround to be enabled. This same compatible
    value will also be used for omap5.

    commit aa2f80e752c75e593b3820f42c416ed9458fa73e upstream.
    
    The best granularity of residue that DMA engine can report is in the BURST
    units, so the serial driver must use MAXBURST = 1 and DMA_SLAVE_BUSWIDTH_1_BYTE
    if it relies on exact number of bytes transferred by DMA engine.

    tty/serial: atmel: use port->name as name in request_irq()
    
    commit 9594b5be7ec110ed11acec58fa94f3f293668c85 upstream.
    
    I was puzzled while looking at /proc/interrupts and random things showed
    up between reboots. This occurred more often but I realised it later. The
    "correct" output should be:
    |38:      11861  atmel-aic5   2 Level     ttyS0
    
    but I saw sometimes
    |38:       6426  atmel-aic5   2 Level     tty1
    
    and accounted it wrongly as correct. This is use after free and the
    former example randomly got the "old" pointer which pointed to the same
    content. With SLAB_FREELIST_RANDOM and HARDENED I even got
    |38:       7067  atmel-aic5   2 Level     E=Started User Manager for UID 0
    
    or other nonsense.
    As it turns out the tty, pointer that is accessed in atmel_startup(), is
    freed() before atmel_shutdown(). It seems to happen quite often that the
    tty for ttyS0 is allocated and freed while ->shutdown is not invoked. I
    don't do anything special - just a systemd boot :)
    
    Use dev_name(&pdev->dev) as the IRQ name for request_irq(). This exists
    as long as the driver is loaded so no use-after-free here.

    Printk format "%pCr" will be removed soon, as clk_get_rate() must not be

    Replace it by open-coding the operation.  This is safe here, as the code

    usb: gadget: function: printer: avoid wrong list handling in printer_write()
    
    commit 4a014a7339f441b0851ce012f469c0fadac61c81 upstream.
    
    When printer_write() calls usb_ep_queue(), a udc driver (e.g.
    renesas_usbhs driver) may call usb_gadget_giveback_request() in
    the udc .queue ops immediately. Then, printer_write() calls
    list_add(&req->list, &dev->tx_reqs_active) wrongly. After that,
    if we do unbind the printer driver, WARN_ON() happens in
    printer_func_unbind() because the list entry is not removed.
    
    So, this patch moves list_add(&req->list, &dev->tx_reqs_active)
    calling before usb_ep_queue().

    usb: typec: wcove: Remove dependency on HW FSM
    
    commit 05826ff135ee083d28c006fbde6e810f17437166 upstream.
    
    The USB Type-C PHY in Intel WhiskeyCove PMIC has build-in
    USB Type-C state machine which we were relying on to
    configure the CC lines correctly. This patch removes that
    dependency and configures the CC line according to commands
    from the port manager (tcpm.c) in wcove_set_cc().
    
    This fixes an issue where USB devices attached to the USB
    Type-C port do not get enumerated. When acting as
    source/host, the HW FSM sometimes fails to configure the PHY
    correctly.

    usb-storage: Add compatibility quirk flags for G-Technologies G-Drive
    
    commit ca7d9515d0e6825351ce106066cea1f60e40b1c8 upstream.
    
    The "G-Drive" (sold by G-Technology) external USB 3.0 drive
     hangs on write access under UAS and usb-storage:
    
    [  136.079121] sd 15:0:0:0: [sdi] tag#0 FAILED Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE

    [  140.584052] Aborting journal on device sdi-8.
    
    The proposed patch adds compatibility quirks. Because the drive requires two
    quirks (one to work with UAS, and another to work with usb-storage), adding this
    under unusual_devs.h and not just unusual_uas.h so kernels compiled without UAS
    receive the quirk. With the patch, the drive works reliably on UAS and usb-
    storage.
    (tested on NEC Corporation uPD720200 USB 3.0 host controller).

    usbip: vhci_sysfs: fix potential Spectre v1
    
    commit a0d6ec88090d7b1b008429c44532a388e29bb1bd upstream.
    
    pdev_nr and rhport can be controlled by user-space, hence leading to
    a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.
    
    This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:
    drivers/usb/usbip/vhci_sysfs.c:238 detach_store() warn: potential spectre issue 'vhcis'
    drivers/usb/usbip/vhci_sysfs.c:328 attach_store() warn: potential spectre issue 'vhcis'
    drivers/usb/usbip/vhci_sysfs.c:338 attach_store() warn: potential spectre issue 'vhci->vhci_hcd_ss->vdev'
    drivers/usb/usbip/vhci_sysfs.c:340 attach_store() warn: potential spectre issue 'vhci->vhci_hcd_hs->vdev'
    
    Fix this by sanitizing pdev_nr and rhport before using them to index
    vhcis and vhci->vhci_hcd_ss->vdev respectively.
    
    Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
    to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
    completed with a dependent load/store [1].

    NFC: pn533: don't send USB data off of the stack
    
    commit dbafc28955fa6779dc23d1607a0fee5e509a278b upstream.
    
    It's amazing that this driver ever worked, but now that x86 doesn't
    allow USB data to be sent off of the stack, it really does not work at
    all.  Fix this up by properly allocating the data for the small
    "commands" that get sent to the device off of the stack.
    
    We do this for one command by having a whole urb just for ack messages,
    as they can be submitted in interrupt context, so we can not use
    usb_bulk_msg().  But the poweron command can sleep (and does), so use
    usb_bulk_msg() for that transfer.

    staging: android: ion: Switch to pr_warn_once in ion_buffer_destroy
    
    commit 45ad559a29629cb1c64ee636563c69b71524f077 upstream.
    
    Syzbot reported yet another warning with Ion:

    Kernel panic - not syncing: panic_on_warn set ...
    
    This is catching that a buffer was freed with an existing kernel mapping
    still present. This can be easily be triggered from userspace by calling
    DMA_BUF_SYNC_START without calling DMA_BUF_SYNC_END. Switch to a single
    pr_warn_once to indicate the error without being disruptive.

    kvm: x86: use correct privilege level for sgdt/sidt/fxsave/fxrstor access
    
    commit 3c9fa24ca7c9c47605672916491f79e8ccacb9e6 upstream.
    
    The functions that were used in the emulation of fxrstor, fxsave, sgdt and
    sidt were originally meant for task switching, and as such they did not
    check privilege levels.  This is very bad when the same functions are used
    in the emulation of unprivileged instructions.  This is CVE-2018-10853.
    
    The obvious fix is to add a new argument to ops->read_std and ops->write_std,
    which decides whether the access is a "system" access or should use the
    processor's CPL.

    Int the next patch the emulator's .read_std and .write_std callbacks will
    grow another argument, which is not needed in kvm_read_guest_virt and
    kvm_write_guest_virt_system's callers.  Since we have to make separate
