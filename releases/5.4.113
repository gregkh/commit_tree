    xen/events: fix setting irq affinity
    
    The backport of upstream patch 25da4618af240fbec61 ("xen/events: don't
    unmask an event channel when an eoi is pending") introduced a
    regression for stable kernels 5.10 and older: setting IRQ affinity for
    IRQs related to interdomain events would no longer work, as moving the
    IRQ to its new cpu was not included in the irq_ack callback for those
    events.
    
    Fix that by adding the needed call.
    
    Note that kernels 5.11 and later don't need the explicit moving of the
    IRQ to the target cpu in the irq_ack callback, due to a rework of the
    affinity setting in kernel 5.11.

    commit fc8c0a99223367b071c83711259d754b6bb7a379 upstream.
    
    bison deprecated the "%pure-parser" directive in favor of "%define

    The api.pure got introduced in bison 2.3 (Oct 2007), so it seems safe to

    block: only update parent bi_status when bio fail
    
    [ Upstream commit 3edf5346e4f2ce2fa0c94651a90a8dda169565ee ]
    
    For multiple split bios, if one of the bio is fail, the whole
    should return error to application. But we found there is a race
    between bio_integrity_verify_fn and bio complete, which return
    io success to application after one of the bio fail. The race as
    following:
    
    split bio(READ)          kworker
    
    nvme_complete_rq
    blk_update_request //split error=0
      bio_endio
        bio_integrity_endio
          queue_work(kintegrityd_wq, &bip->bip_work);
    
                             bio_integrity_verify_fn
                             bio_endio //split bio
                              __bio_chain_endio
                                 if (!parent->bi_status)
    
                                   <interrupt entry>
                                   nvme_irq
                                     blk_update_request //parent error=7
                                     req_bio_endio
                                        bio->bi_status = 7 //parent bio
                                   <interrupt exit>
    
                                   parent->bi_status = 0
                            parent->bi_end_io() // return bi_status=0
    
    The bio has been split as two: split and parent. When split
    bio completed, it depends on kworker to do endio, while
    bio_integrity_verify_fn have been interrupted by parent bio
    complete irq handler. Then, parent bio->bi_status which have
    been set in irq handler will overwrite by kworker.
    
    In fact, even without the above race, we also need to conside
    the concurrency beteen mulitple split bio complete and update
    the same parent bi_status. Normally, multiple split bios will
    be issued to the same hctx and complete from the same irq
    vector. But if we have updated queue map between multiple split
    bios, these bios may complete on different hw queue and different
    irq vector. Then the concurrency update parent bi_status may
    cause the final status error.

    drm/tegra: dc: Don't set PLL clock to 0Hz
    
    [ Upstream commit f8fb97c915954fc6de6513cdf277103b5c6df7b3 ]
    
    RGB output doesn't allow to change parent clock rate of the display and
    PCLK rate is set to 0Hz in this case. The tegra_dc_commit_state() shall
    not set the display clock to 0Hz since this change propagates to the
    parent clock. The DISP clock is defined as a NODIV clock by the tegra-clk
    driver and all NODIV clocks use the CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT flag.
    
    This bug stayed unnoticed because by default PLLP is used as the parent
    clock for the display controller and PLLP silently skips the erroneous 0Hz
    rate changes because it always has active child clocks that don't permit
    rate changes. The PLLP isn't acceptable for some devices that we want to
    upstream (like Samsung Galaxy Tab and ASUS TF700T) due to a display panel
    clock rate requirements that can't be fulfilled by using PLLP and then the
    bug pops up in this case since parent clock is set to 0Hz, killing the
    display output.
    
    Don't touch DC clock if pclk=0 in order to fix the problem.

    [ Upstream commit 33ce7f2f95cabb5834cf0906308a5cb6103976da ]
    
    When CONFIG_OF is disabled, building with 'make W=1' produces warnings
    about out of bounds array access:
    
    drivers/gpu/drm/imx/imx-ldb.c: In function 'imx_ldb_set_clock.constprop':
    drivers/gpu/drm/imx/imx-ldb.c:186:8: error: array subscript -22 is below array bounds of 'struct clk *[4]' [-Werror=array-bounds]
    
    Add an error check before the index is used, which helps with the
    warning, as well as any possible other error condition that may be
    triggered at runtime.
    
    The warning could be fixed by adding a Kconfig depedency on CONFIG_OF,
    but Liu Ying points out that the driver may hit the out-of-bounds
    problem at runtime anyway.

    Currently we advertise the ID_AA6DFR0_EL1.TRACEVER for the guest,

    Lets be nice to the guest and hide the feature to avoid
    unexpected behavior.
    
    Even though this can be done at KVM sysreg emulation layer,
    we do this by removing the TRACEVER from the sanitised feature
    register field. This is fine as long as the ETM drivers
    can handle the individual trace units separately, even
    when there are differences among the CPUs.

    interconnect: core: fix error return code of icc_link_destroy()
    
    [ Upstream commit 715ea61532e731c62392221238906704e63d75b6 ]
    
    When krealloc() fails and new is NULL, no error return code of
    icc_link_destroy() is assigned.
    To fix this bug, ret is assigned with -ENOMEM hen new is NULL.
