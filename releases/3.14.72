    xfs: skip stale inodes in xfs_iflush_cluster
    
    commit 7d3aa7fe970791f1a674b14572a411accf2f4d4e upstream.
    
    We don't write back stale inodes so we should skip them in
    xfs_iflush_cluster, too.

    xfs: fix inode validity check in xfs_iflush_cluster
    
    commit 51b07f30a71c27405259a0248206ed4e22adbee2 upstream.
    
    Some careless idiot(*) wrote crap code in commit 1a3e8f3 ("xfs:
    convert inode cache lookups to use RCU locking") back in late 2010,
    and so xfs_iflush_cluster checks the wrong inode for whether it is
    still valid under RCU protection. Fix it to lock and check the
    correct inode.

    xfs: xfs_iflush_cluster fails to abort on error
    
    commit b1438f477934f5a4d5a44df26f3079a7575d5946 upstream.
    
    When a failure due to an inode buffer occurs, the error handling
    fails to abort the inode writeback correctly. This can result in the
    inode being reclaimed whilst still in the AIL, leading to
    use-after-free situations as well as filesystems that cannot be
    unmounted as the inode log items left in the AIL never get removed.
    
    Fix this by ensuring fatal errors from xfs_imap_to_bp() result in
    the inode flush being aborted correctly.

    With netconsole (at least) the pr_err("...  disablingn") call can

    ext4: silence UBSAN in ext4_mb_init()
    
    commit 935244cd54b86ca46e69bc6604d2adfb1aec2d42 upstream.
    
    Currently, in ext4_mb_init(), there's a loop like the following:
    
      do {
        ...
        offset += 1 << (sb->s_blocksize_bits - i);
        i++;
      } while (i <= sb->s_blocksize_bits + 1);
    
    Note that the updated offset is used in the loop's next iteration only.
    
    However, at the last iteration, that is at i == sb->s_blocksize_bits + 1,
    the shift count becomes equal to (unsigned)-1 > 31 (c.f. C99 6.5.7(3))
    and UBSAN reports
    
      UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in fs/ext4/mballoc.c:2621:15

    Observe that the mentioned shift exponent, 4294967295, equals (unsigned)-1.
    
    Unless compilers start to do some fancy transformations (which at least
    GCC 6.0.0 doesn't currently do), the issue is of cosmetic nature only: the
    such calculated value of offset is never used again.
    
    Silence UBSAN by introducing another variable, offset_incr, holding the
    next increment to apply to offset and adjust that one by right shifting it
    by one position per loop iteration.

    ext4: fix hang when processing corrupted orphaned inode list
    
    commit c9eb13a9105e2e418f72e46a2b6da3f49e696902 upstream.
    
    If the orphaned inode list contains inode #5, ext4_iget() returns a
    bad inode (since the bootloader inode should never be referenced
    directly).  Because of the bad inode, we end up processing the inode
    repeatedly and this hangs the machine.
    
    This can be reproduced via:
    
       mke2fs -t ext4 /tmp/foo.img 100
       debugfs -w -R "ssv last_orphan 5" /tmp/foo.img
       mount -o loop /tmp/foo.img /mnt
    
    (But don't do this if you are using an unpatched kernel if you care
    about the system staying functional.  :-)
    
    This bug was found by the port of American Fuzzy Lop into the kernel
    to find file system problems[1].  (Since it *only* happens if inode #5
    shows up on the orphan list --- 3, 7, 8, etc. won't do it, it's not
    surprising that AFL needed two hours before it found it.)

    drm/fb_helper: Fix references to dev->mode_config.num_connector
    
    commit 255f0e7c418ad95a4baeda017ae6182ba9b3c423 upstream.
    
    During boot, MST hotplugs are generally expected (even if no physical
    hotplugging occurs) and result in DRM's connector topology changing.
    This means that using num_connector from the current mode configuration
    can lead to the number of connectors changing under us. This can lead to
    some nasty scenarios in fbcon:
    
    - We allocate an array to the size of dev->mode_config.num_connectors.
    - MST hotplug occurs, dev->mode_config.num_connectors gets incremented.
    - We try to loop through each element in the array using the new value
      of dev->mode_config.num_connectors, and end up going out of bounds
      since dev->mode_config.num_connectors is now larger then the array we
      allocated.
    
    fb_helper->connector_count however, will always remain consistent while
    we do a modeset in fb_helper.
    
    Note: This is just polish for 4.7, Dave Airlie's drm_connector
    refcounting fixed these bugs for real. But it's good enough duct-tape
    for stable kernel backporting, since backporting the refcounting
    changes is way too invasive.

    sunrpc: fix stripping of padded MIC tokens
    
    commit c0cb8bf3a8e4bd82e640862cdd8891400405cb89 upstream.
    
    The length of the GSS MIC token need not be a multiple of four bytes.
    It is then padded by XDR to a multiple of 4 B, but unwrap_integ_data()
    would previously only trim mic.len + 4 B. The remaining up to three
    bytes would then trigger a check in nfs4svc_decode_compoundargs(),
    leading to a "garbage args" error and mount failure:
    
    nfs4svc_decode_compoundargs: compound not properly padded!
    nfsd: failed to decode arguments!
    
    This would prevent older clients using the pre-RFC 4121 MIC format
    (37-byte MIC including a 9-byte OID) from mounting exports from v3.9+
    servers using krb5i.
    
    The trimming was introduced by commit 4c190e2f913f ("sunrpc: trim off
    trailing checksum before returning decrypted or integrity authenticated
    buffer").

    xen/events: Don't move disabled irqs
    
    commit f0f393877c71ad227d36705d61d1e4062bc29cf5 upstream.
    
    Commit ff1e22e7a638 ("xen/events: Mask a moving irq") open-coded
    irq_move_irq() but left out checking if the IRQ is disabled. This broke
    resuming from suspend since it tries to move a (disabled) irq without
    holding the IRQ's desc->lock. Fix it by adding in a check for disabled
    IRQs.

    powerpc/book3s64: Fix branching to OOL handlers in relocatable kernel
    
    commit 8ed8ab40047a570fdd8043a40c104a57248dd3fd upstream.
    
    Some of the interrupt vectors on 64-bit POWER server processors are only
    32 bytes long (8 instructions), which is not enough for the full
    first-level interrupt handler. For these we need to branch to an
    out-of-line (OOL) handler. But when we are running a relocatable kernel,
    interrupt vectors till __end_interrupts marker are copied down to real
    address 0x100. So, branching to labels (ie. OOL handlers) outside this
    section must be handled differently (see LOAD_HANDLER()), considering
    relocatable kernel, which would need at least 4 instructions.
    
    However, branching from interrupt vector means that we corrupt the
    CFAR (come-from address register) on POWER7 and later processors as
    mentioned in commit 1707dd16. So, EXCEPTION_PROLOG_0 (6 instructions)
    that contains the part up to the point where the CFAR is saved in the
    PACA should be part of the short interrupt vectors before we branch out
    to OOL handlers.
    
    But as mentioned already, there are interrupt vectors on 64-bit POWER
    server processors that are only 32 bytes long (like vectors 0x4f00,
    0x4f20, etc.), which cannot accomodate the above two cases at the same
    time owing to space constraint. Currently, in these interrupt vectors,
    we simply branch out to OOL handlers, without using LOAD_HANDLER(),
    which leaves us vulnerable when running a relocatable kernel (eg. kdump
    case). While this has been the case for sometime now and kdump is used
    widely, we were fortunate not to see any problems so far, for three
    reasons:
    
      1. In almost all cases, production kernel (relocatable) is used for
         kdump as well, which would mean that crashed kernel's OOL handler
         would be at the same place where we end up branching to, from short
         interrupt vector of kdump kernel.
      2. Also, OOL handler was unlikely the reason for crash in almost all
         the kdump scenarios, which meant we had a sane OOL handler from
         crashed kernel that we branched to.
      3. On most 64-bit POWER server processors, page size is large enough
         that marking interrupt vector code as executable (see commit
         429d2e83) leads to marking OOL handler code from crashed kernel,
         that sits right below interrupt vector code from kdump kernel, as
         executable as well.
    
    Let us fix this by moving the __end_interrupts marker down past OOL
    handlers to make sure that we also copy OOL handlers to real address
    0x100 when running a relocatable kernel.
    
    This fix has been tested successfully in kdump scenario, on an LPAR with
    4K page size by using different default/production kernel and kdump
    kernel.
    
    Also tested by manually corrupting the OOL handlers in the first kernel
    and then kdump'ing, and then causing the OOL handlers to fire - mpe.

    pipe: Fix buffer offset after partially failed read
    
    commit feae3ca2e5e1a8f44aa6290255d3d9709985d0b2 upstream.
    
    Quoting the RHEL advisory:
    
    > It was found that the fix for CVE-2015-1805 incorrectly kept buffer
    > offset and buffer length in sync on a failed atomic read, potentially
    > resulting in a pipe buffer state corruption. A local, unprivileged user
    > could use this flaw to crash the system or leak kernel memory to user
    > space. (CVE-2016-0774, Moderate)
    
    The same flawed fix was applied to stable branches from 2.6.32.y to
    3.14.y inclusive, and I was able to reproduce the issue on 3.2.y.
    We need to give pipe_iov_copy_to_user() a separate offset variable
    and only update the buffer offset if it succeeds.

    PCI: Disable all BAR sizing for devices with non-compliant BARs
    
    commit ad67b437f187ea818b2860524d10f878fadfdd99 upstream.
    
    b84106b4e229 ("PCI: Disable IO/MEM decoding for devices with non-compliant
    BARs") disabled BAR sizing for BARs 0-5 of devices that don't comply with
    the PCI spec.  But it didn't do anything for expansion ROM BARs, so we
    still try to size them, resulting in warnings like this on Broadwell-EP:
    
      pci 0000:ff:12.0: BAR 6: failed to assign [mem size 0x00000001 pref]
    
    Move the non-compliant BAR check from __pci_read_base() up to
    pci_read_bases() so it applies to the expansion ROM BAR as well as
    to BARs 0-5.
    
    Note that direct callers of __pci_read_base(), like sriov_init(), will now
    bypass this check.  We haven't had reports of devices with broken SR-IOV
    BARs yet.

    cpuidle: Indicate when a device has been unregistered
    
    commit c998c07836f985b24361629dc98506ec7893e7a0 upstream.
    
    Currently the 'registered' member of the cpuidle_device struct is set
    to 1 during cpuidle_register_device. In this same function there are
    checks to see if the device is already registered to prevent duplicate
    calls to register the device, but this value is never set to 0 even on
    unregister of the device. Because of this, any attempt to call
    cpuidle_register_device after a call to cpuidle_unregister_device will
    fail which shouldn't be the case.
    
    To prevent this, set registered to 0 when the device is unregistered.

    aacraid: Fix for aac_command_thread hang
    
    commit fc4bf75ea300a5e62a2419f89dd0e22189dd7ab7 upstream.
    
    Typically under error conditions, it is possible for aac_command_thread()
    to miss the wakeup from kthread_stop() and go back to sleep, causing it
    to hang aac_shutdown.
    
    In the observed scenario, the adapter is not functioning correctly and so
    aac_fib_send() never completes (or time-outs depending on how it was
    called). Shortly after aac_command_thread() starts it performs
    aac_fib_send(SendHostTime) which hangs. When aac_probe_one
    /aac_get_adapter_info send time outs, kthread_stop is called which breaks
    the command thread out of it's hang.
    
    The code will still go back to sleep in schedule_timeout() without
    checking kthread_should_stop() so it causes aac_probe_one to hang until
    the schedule_timeout() which is 30 minutes.
    
    Fixed by: Adding another kthread_should_stop() before schedule_timeout()

    aacraid: Relinquish CPU during timeout wait
    
    commit 07beca2be24cc710461c0b131832524c9ee08910 upstream.
    
    aac_fib_send has a special function case for initial commands during
    driver initialization using wait < 0(pseudo sync mode). In this case,
    the command does not sleep but rather spins checking for timeout.This
    loop is calls cpu_relax() in an attempt to allow other processes/threads
    to use the CPU, but this function does not relinquish the CPU and so the
    command will hog the processor. This was observed in a KDUMP
    "crashkernel" and that prevented the "command thread" (which is
    responsible for completing the command from being timed out) from
    starting because it could not get the CPU.
    
    Fixed by replacing "cpu_relax()" call with "schedule()"

    MIPS: ath79: make bootconsole wait for both THRE and TEMT
    
    commit f5b556c94c8490d42fea79d7b4ae0ecbc291e69d upstream.
    
    This makes the ath79 bootconsole behave the same way as the generic 8250
    bootconsole.
    
    Also waiting for TEMT (transmit buffer is empty) instead of just THRE
    (transmit buffer is not full) ensures that all characters have been
    transmitted before the real serial driver starts reconfiguring the serial
    controller (which would sometimes result in garbage being transmitted.)
    This change does not cause a visible performance loss.
    
    In addition, this seems to fix a hang observed in certain configurations on
    many AR7xxx/AR9xxx SoCs during autoconfig of the real serial driver.
    
    A more complete follow-up patch will disable 8250 autoconfig for ath79
    altogether (the serial controller is detected as a 16550A, which is not
    fully compatible with the ath79 serial, and the autoconfig may lead to
    undefined behavior on ath79.)

    When emulating a jalr instruction with rd == $0, the code in

    always remain zeroed. This would lead to any further instructions
    emulated which use $0 operating on a bogus value until the task is next
    context switched, at which point the value of $0 in the task context
    would be restored to the correct zero by a store in SAVE_SOME. Fix this
    by not writing to rd if it is $0.
