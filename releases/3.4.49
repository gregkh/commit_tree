    ftrace: Move ftrace_filter_lseek out of CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE section
    
    commit 7f49ef69db6bbf756c0abca7e9b65b32e999eec8 upstream.
    
    As ftrace_filter_lseek is now used with ftrace_pid_fops, it needs to
    be moved out of the #ifdef CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE section as the
    ftrace_pid_fops is defined when DYNAMIC_FTRACE is not.

    tracing: Fix possible NULL pointer dereferences
    
    commit 6a76f8c0ab19f215af2a3442870eeb5f0e81998d upstream.
    
    Currently set_ftrace_pid and set_graph_function files use seq_lseek
    for their fops.  However seq_open() is called only for FMODE_READ in
    the fops->open() so that if an user tries to seek one of those file
    when she open it for writing, it sees NULL seq_file and then panic.
    
    It can be easily reproduced with following command:
    
      $ cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
      $ echo 1234 | sudo tee -a set_ftrace_pid
    
    In this example, GNU coreutils' tee opens the file with fopen(, "a")
    and then the fopen() internally calls lseek().

    By having a higher max resolution we can now set up a virtual

    drm/i915: no lvds quirk for hp t5740
    
    commit 45a211d75137b1ac869a8a758a6667f15827a115 upstream.
    
    Last year, a patch was made for the "HP t5740e Thin Client" (see
    http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2012-May/023245.html).
    This device reports an lvds panel, but does not really have one.
    
    The predecessor of this device is the "hp t5740", which also does not have
    an lvds panel. This patch will add the same quirk for this device.

    drm: fix a use-after-free when GPU acceleration disabled
    
    commit b7ea85a4fed37835eec78a7be3039c8dc22b8178 upstream.
    
    When GPU acceleration is disabled, drm_vblank_cleanup() will free the
    vblank-related data, such as vblank_refcount, vblank_inmodeset, etc.
    But we found that drm_vblank_post_modeset() may be called after the
    cleanup, which use vblank_refcount and vblank_inmodeset. And this will
    cause a kernel panic.
    
    Fix this by return immediately if dev->num_crtcs is zero. This is the
    same thing that drm_vblank_pre_modeset() does.

    radeon: Fix system hang issue when using KMS with older cards
    
    commit e49f3959a96dc279860af7e86e6dbcfda50580a5 upstream.
    
    The current radeon driver initialization routines, when using KMS, are written
    so that the IRQ installation routine is called before initializing the WB buffer
    and the CP rings. With some ASICs, though, the IRQ routine tries to access the
    GFX_INDEX ring causing a call to RREG32 with the value of -1 in
    radeon_fence_read. This, in turn causes the system to completely hang with some
    cards, requiring a hard reset.
    
    A call stack that can cause such a hang looks like this (using rv515 ASIC for the
    example here):
     * rv515_init (rv515.c)
     * radeon_irq_kms_init (radeon_irq_kms.c)
     * drm_irq_install (drm_irq.c)
     * radeon_driver_irq_preinstall_kms (radeon_irq_kms.c)
     * rs600_irq_process (rs600.c)
     * radeon_fence_process - due to SW interrupt (radeon_fence.c)
     * radeon_fence_read (radeon_fence.c)
     * hang due to RREG32(-1)
    
    The patch moves the IRQ installation to the card startup routine, after the ring
    has been initialized, but before the IRQ has been set. This fixes the issue, but
    requires a check to see if the IRQ is already installed, as is the case in the
    system resume codepath.
    I have tested the patch on three machines using the rv515, the rv770 and the
    evergreen ASIC. They worked without issues.
    
    This seems to be a known issue and has been reported on several bug tracking
    sites by various distributions (see links below). Most of reports recommend
    booting the system with KMS disabled and then enabling KMS by reloading the
    radeon module. For some reason, this was indeed a usable workaround, however,
    UMS is now deprecated and disabled by default.

    powerpc/eeh: Don't check RTAS token to get PE addr
    
    commit b8b3de224f194005ad87ede6fd022fcc2bef3b1a upstream.
    
    RTAS token "ibm,get-config-addr-info" or ibm,get-config-addr-info2"
    are used to retrieve the PE address according to PCI address, which
    made up of domain/bus/slot/function. If we don't have those 2 tokens,
    the domain/bus/slot/function would be used as the address for EEH
    RTAS operations. Some older f/w might not have those 2 tokens and
    that blocks the EEH functionality to be initialized. It was introduced
    by commit e2af155c ("powerpc/eeh: pseries platform EEH initialization").
    
    The patch skips the check on those 2 tokens so we can bring up EEH
    functionality successfully. And domain/bus/slot/function will be
    used as address for EEH RTAS operations.

    This patch reverts commit 3e619d04159be54b3daa0b7036b0ce9e067f4b5d
    (USB: EHCI: fix bug in scheduling periodic split transfers).  The
    commit was valid -- it fixed a real bug -- but the periodic scheduler
    in ehci-hcd is in such bad shape (especially the part that handles
    split transactions) that fixing one bug is very likely to cause
    another to surface.  That's what happened in this case; the result was
    choppy and noisy playback on certain 24-bit audio devices.
    
    The only real fix will be to rewrite this entire section of code.  My
    next project...
    
    This fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1136110.
    
    Thanks to Tim Richardson for extra testing and feedback, and to Joseph
    Salisbury and Tyson Tan for tracking down the original source of the
    problem.

    commit 6529591e3eef65f0f528a81ac169f6e294b947a7 upstream.
    
    The patch adds a new HIDCOM device and does not affect other devices
    driven by the cypress_M8 module. Changes are:
    - add VendorID ProductID to device tables
    - skip unstable speed check because FRWD uses 115200bps
    - skip reset at probe which is an issue workaround for this
    particular device.

    xhci-mem: init list heads at the beginning of init
    
    commit 331de00a64e5027365145bdf51da27b9ce15dfd5 upstream.
    
    It is possible that we fail on xhci_mem_init, just before doing
    the INIT_LIST_HEAD, and calling xhci_mem_cleanup.
    
    Problem is that, the list_for_each_entry_safe macro, assumes
    list heads are initialized (not NULL), and dereferences their 'next'
    pointer, causing a kernel panic if this is not yet initialized.
    
    Let's protect from that by moving inits to the beginning.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.2, that
    contain the commit 9574323c39d1f8359a04843075d89c9f32d8b7e6 "xHCI: test

    xhci - correct comp_mode_recovery_timer on return from hibernate
    
    commit 77df9e0b799b03e1d5d9c68062709af5f637e834 upstream.
    
    Commit 71c731a2 (usb: host: xhci: Fix Compliance Mode on SN65LVPE502CP
    Hardware) was a workaround for systems using the SN65LVPE502CP,
    controller, but it introduced a bug in resume from hibernate.
    
    The fix created a timer, comp_mode_recovery_timer, which is deleted from
    a timer list when xhci_suspend() is called. However, the hibernate image,
    including the timer list containing the comp_mode_recovery_timer, had
    already been saved before the timer was deleted.
    
    Upon resume from hibernate, the list containing the comp_mode_recovery_timer
    is restored from the image saved to disk, and xhci_resume(), assuming that
    the timer had been deleted by xhci_suspend(), makes a call to
    compliance_mode_recoery_timer_init(), which creates a new instance of the
    comp_mode_recovery_timer and attempts to place it into the same list in which
    it is already active, thus corrupting the list during the list_add() call.
    
    At this point, a call trace is emitted indicating the list corruption.
    Soon afterward, the system locks up, the watchdog times out, and the
    ensuing NMI crashes the system.
    
    The problem did not occur when resuming from suspend. In suspend, the
    image in RAM remains exactly as it was when xhci_suspend() deleted the
    comp_mode_recovery_timer, so there is no problem when xhci_resume()
    creates a new instance of this timer and places it in the still empty
    list.
    
    This patch avoids the problem by deleting the timer in xhci_resume()
    when resuming from hibernate. Now xhci_resume() can safely make the
    call to create a new instance of this timer, whether returning from
    suspend or hibernate.
    
    Thanks to Alan Stern for his help with understanding the problem.
    
    [Sarah reworked this patch to cover the case where the xHCI restore
    register operation fails, and (temp & STS_SRE) is true (and we re-init
    the host, including re-init for the compliance mode), but hibernate is
    false.  The original patch would have caused list corruption in this
    case.]
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.2, that
    contain the commit 71c731a296f1b08a3724bd1b514b64f1bda87a23 "usb: host:
