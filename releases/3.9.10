    mem_cgroup_put is hierarchy aware so mem_cgroup_put(memcg) already drops
    an additional reference from all parents so the additional
    mem_cgrroup_put(parent) potentially causes use-after-free.

    SCSI: sd: Fix parsing of 'temporary ' cache mode prefix

    Commit 39c60a0948cc '[SCSI] sd: fix array cache flushing bug causing
    performance problems' added temp as a pointer to "temporary " and used
    sizeof(temp) - 1 as its length.  But sizeof(temp) is the size of the
    pointer, not the size of the string constant.  Change temp to a static
    array so that sizeof() does what was intended.

    KVM: VMX: mark unusable segment as nonpresent
    
    commit 03617c188f41eeeb4223c919ee7e66e5a114f2c6 upstream.
    
    Some userspaces do not preserve unusable property. Since usable
    segment has to be present according to VMX spec we can use present
    property to amend userspace bug by making unusable segment always
    nonpresent. vmx_segment_access_rights() already marks nonpresent segment
    as unusable.

    nfsd4: fix decoding of compounds across page boundaries
    
    commit 247500820ebd02ad87525db5d9b199e5b66f6636 upstream.
    
    A freebsd NFSv4.0 client was getting rare IO errors expanding a tarball.
    A network trace showed the server returning BAD_XDR on the final getattr
    of a getattr+write+getattr compound.  The final getattr started on a
    page boundary.
    
    I believe the Linux client ignores errors on the post-write getattr, and
    that that's why we haven't seen this before.

    futex: Take hugepages into account when generating futex_key
    
    commit 13d60f4b6ab5b702dc8d2ee20999f98a93728aec upstream.
    
    The futex_keys of process shared futexes are generated from the page
    offset, the mapping host and the mapping index of the futex user space
    address. This should result in an unique identifier for each futex.
    
    Though this is not true when futexes are located in different subpages
    of an hugepage. The reason is, that the mapping index for all those
    futexes evaluates to the index of the base page of the hugetlbfs
    mapping. So a futex at offset 0 of the hugepage mapping and another
    one at offset PAGE_SIZE of the same hugepage mapping have identical
    futex_keys. This happens because the futex code blindly uses
    page->index.
    
    Steps to reproduce the bug:
    
    1. Map a file from hugetlbfs. Initialize pthread_mutex1 at offset 0
       and pthread_mutex2 at offset PAGE_SIZE of the hugetlbfs
       mapping.
    
       The mutexes must be initialized as PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED because
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE mutexes are not affected by this issue as
       their keys solely depend on the user space address.
    
    2. Lock mutex1 and mutex2
    
    3. Create thread1 and in the thread function lock mutex1, which
       results in thread1 blocking on the locked mutex1.
    
    4. Create thread2 and in the thread function lock mutex2, which
       results in thread2 blocking on the locked mutex2.
    
    5. Unlock mutex2. Despite the fact that mutex2 got unlocked, thread2
       still blocks on mutex2 because the futex_key points to mutex1.
    
    To solve this issue we need to take the normal page index of the page
    which contains the futex into account, if the futex is in an hugetlbfs
    mapping. In other words, we calculate the normal page mapping index of
    the subpage in the hugetlbfs mapping.
    
    Mappings which are not based on hugetlbfs are not affected and still
    use page->index.
    
    Thanks to Mel Gorman who provided a patch for adding proper evaluation
    functions to the hugetlbfs code to avoid exposing hugetlbfs specific
    details to the futex code.

    block: do not pass disk names as format strings
    
    commit ffc8b30866879ed9ba62bd0a86fecdbd51cd3d19 upstream.
    
    Disk names may contain arbitrary strings, so they must not be
    interpreted as format strings.  It seems that only md allows arbitrary
    strings to be used for disk names, but this could allow for a local
    memory corruption from uid 0 into ring 0.

    module: do percpu allocation after uniqueness check. No, really!
    
    commit 8d8022e8aba85192e937f1f0f7450e256d66ae5c upstream.
    
    v3.8-rc1-5-g1fb9341 was supposed to stop parallel kvm loads exhausting
    percpu memory on large machines:
    
        Now we have a new state MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED, we can insert the
        module into the list (and thus guarantee its uniqueness) before we
        allocate the per-cpu region.
    
    In my defence, it didn't actually say the patch did this.  Just that
    we "can".
    
    This patch actually *does* it.

    drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c: use kzalloc() for failing hardware
    
    commit 542db01579fbb7ea7d1f7bb9ddcef1559df660b2 upstream.
    
    In drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c mmc_ioctl_cdrom_read_data() allocates a memory
    area with kmalloc in line 2885.
    
      2885         cgc->buffer = kmalloc(blocksize, GFP_KERNEL);
      2886         if (cgc->buffer == NULL)
      2887                 return -ENOMEM;
    
    In line 2908 we can find the copy_to_user function:
    
      2908         if (!ret && copy_to_user(arg, cgc->buffer, blocksize))
    
    The cgc->buffer is never cleaned and initialized before this function.
    If ret = 0 with the previous basic block, it's possible to display some
    memory bytes in kernel space from userspace.
    
    When we read a block from the disk it normally fills the ->buffer but if
    the drive is malfunctioning there is a chance that it would only be
    partially filled.  The result is an leak information to userspace.

    A malicious monitor can craft an auth reply message that could cause a

    To prevent this, the auth_none protocol handler needs an empty
