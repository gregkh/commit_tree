    mm: fix crashes from mbind() merging vmas
    
    commit d05f0cdcbe6388723f1900c549b4850360545201 upstream.
    
    In v2.6.34 commit 9d8cebd4bcd7 ("mm: fix mbind vma merge problem")
    introduced vma merging to mbind(), but it should have also changed the
    convention of passing start vma from queue_pages_range() (formerly
    check_range()) to new_vma_page(): vma merging may have already freed
    that structure, resulting in BUG at mm/mempolicy.c:1738 and probably
    worse crashes.

    mm/numa: Remove BUG_ON() in __handle_mm_fault()
    
    commit 107437febd495a50e2cd09c81bbaa84d30e57b07 upstream.
    
    Changing PTEs and PMDs to pte_numa & pmd_numa is done with the
    mmap_sem held for reading, which means a pmd can be instantiated
    and turned into a numa one while __handle_mm_fault() is examining
    the value of old_pmd.
    
    If that happens, __handle_mm_fault() should just return and let
    the page fault retry, instead of throwing an oops. This is
    handled by the test for pmd_trans_huge(*pmd) below.

    drm/i915: fix display power sw state reporting
    
    commit b8c000d9bf23e7c1155ef421f595d1cbc25262da upstream.
    
    Atm, we refcount both power domains and power wells and
    intel_display_power_enabled_sw() returns the power domain refcount. What
    the callers are really interested in though is the sw state of the
    underlying power wells. Due to this we will report incorrectly that a
    given power domain is off if its power wells were enabled via another
    power domain, for example POWER_DOMAIN_INIT which enables all power
    wells.
    
    As a fix return instead the state based on the refcount of all power
    wells included in the passed in power domain.

    Another (unrelated, theoretical) issue: Don't attempt to bump refcnt of a conntrack
    whose reference count is already 0.  Such conntrack is being destroyed
    right now, its memory is freed once we release the percpu dying spinlock.

    netfilter: nf_nat: fix oops on netns removal
    
    commit 945b2b2d259d1a4364a2799e80e8ff32f8c6ee6f upstream.
    
    Quoting Samu Kallio:
    
     Basically what's happening is, during netns cleanup,
     nf_nat_net_exit gets called before ipv4_net_exit. As I understand
     it, nf_nat_net_exit is supposed to kill any conntrack entries which
     have NAT context (through nf_ct_iterate_cleanup), but for some
     reason this doesn't happen (perhaps something else is still holding
     refs to those entries?).
    
     When ipv4_net_exit is called, conntrack entries (including those
     with NAT context) are cleaned up, but the
     nat_bysource hashtable is long gone - freed in nf_nat_net_exit. The
     bug happens when attempting to free a conntrack entry whose NAT hash
     'prev' field points to a slot in the freed hash table (head for that
     bin).
    
    We ignore conntracks with null nat bindings.  But this is wrong,
    as these are in bysource hash table as well.
    
    Restore nat-cleaning for the netns-is-being-removed case.

    commit 266155b2de8fb721ae353688529b2f8bcdde2f90 upstream.
    
    The dumping prematurely stops, it seems the callback argument that
    indicates that all entries have been dumped is set after iterating
    on the first cpu list. The dumping also may stop before the entire
    per-cpu list content is also dumped.
    
    With this patch, conntrack -L dying now shows the dying list content
    again.

    tty: Correct INPCK handling
    
    commit 66528f90669691c85c73bea4f0c9f4a5857c4cab upstream.
    
    If INPCK is not set, input parity detection should be disabled. This means
    parity errors should not be received from the tty driver, and the data
    received should be treated normally.
    
    SUS v3, 11.2.2, General Terminal Interface - Input Modes, states:
      "If INPCK is set, input parity checking shall be enabled. If INPCK is
       not set, input parity checking shall be disabled, allowing output parity
       generation without input parity errors. Note that whether input parity
       checking is enabled or disabled is independent of whether parity detection
       is enabled or disabled (see Control Modes). If parity detection is enabled
       but input parity checking is disabled, the hardware to which the terminal
       is connected shall recognize the parity bit, but the terminal special file
       shall not check whether or not this bit is correctly set."
    
    Ignore parity errors reported by the tty driver when INPCK is not set, and
    handle the received data normally.

    serial: Fix IGNBRK handling
    
    commit ef8b9ddcb45fa3b1e11acd72be2398001e807d14 upstream.
    
    If IGNBRK is set without either BRKINT or PARMRK set, some uart
    drivers send a 0x00 byte for BREAK without the TTYBREAK flag to the
    line discipline, when it should send either nothing or the TTYBREAK flag
    set. This happens because the read_status_mask masks out the BI
    condition, which uart_insert_char() then interprets as a normal 0x00 byte.
    
    SUS v3 is clear regarding the meaning of IGNBRK; Section 11.2.2, General
    Terminal Interface - Input Modes, states:
      "If IGNBRK is set, a break condition detected on input shall be ignored;
       that is, not put on the input queue and therefore not read by any
       process."
    
    Fix read_status_mask to include the BI bit if IGNBRK is set; the
    lsr status retains the BI bit if a BREAK is recv'd, which is
    subsequently ignored in uart_insert_char() when masked with the
    ignore_status_mask.

    net/mlx4_core: Keep only one driver entry release mlx4_priv
    
    commit da1de8dfff09d33d4a5345762c21b487028e25f5 upstream.
    
    Following commit befdf89 "net/mlx4_core: Preserve pci_dev_data after
    __mlx4_remove_one()", there are two mlx4 pci callbacks which will
    attempt to release the mlx4_priv object -- .shutdown and .remove.
    
    This leads to a use-after-free access to the already freed mlx4_priv
    instance and trigger a "Kernel access of bad area" crash when both
    .shutdown and .remove are called.
    
    During reboot or kexec, .shutdown is called, with the VFs probed to
    the host going through shutdown first and then the PF. Later, the PF
    will trigger VFs' .remove since VFs still have driver attached.
    
    Fix that by keeping only one driver entry which releases mlx4_priv.

    irqchip: spear_shirq: Fix interrupt offset
    
    commit 4f4366033945419b0c52118c29d3057d7c558765 upstream.
    
    The ras3 block on spear320 claims to have 3 interrupts. In fact it has
    one and 6 reserved interrupts. Account the 6 reserved to this block so
    it has 7 interrupts total. That matches the datasheet and the device
    tree entries.

    md: flush writes before starting a recovery.
    
    commit 133d4527eab8d199a62eee6bd433f0776842df2e upstream.
    
    When we write to a degraded array which has a bitmap, we
    make sure the relevant bit in the bitmap remains set when
    the write completes (so a 're-add' can quickly rebuilt a
    temporarily-missing device).
    
    If, immediately after such a write starts, we incorporate a spare,
    commence recovery, and skip over the region where the write is
    happening (because the 'needs recovery' flag isn't set yet),
    then that write will not get to the new device.
    
    Once the recovery finishes the new device will be trusted, but will
    have incorrect data, leading to possible corruption.
    
    We cannot set the 'needs recovery' flag when we start the write as we
    do not know easily if the write will be "degraded" or not.  That
    depends on details of the particular raid level and particular write
    request.
    
    This patch fixes a corruption issue of long standing and so it
    suitable for any -stable kernel.  It applied correctly to 3.0 at
    least and will minor editing to earlier kernels.

    tracing/uprobes: Fix the usage of uprobe_buffer_enable() in probe_event_enable()
    
    commit fb6bab6a5ad46d00b5ffa22268f21df1cd7c59df upstream.
    
    The usage of uprobe_buffer_enable() added by dcad1a20 is very wrong,
    
    1. uprobe_buffer_enable() and uprobe_buffer_disable() are not balanced,
       _enable() should be called only if !enabled.
    
    2. If uprobe_buffer_enable() fails probe_event_enable() should clear
       tp.flags and free event_file_link.
    
    3. If uprobe_register() fails it should do uprobe_buffer_disable().

    tracing/uprobes: Revert "Support mix of ftrace and perf"
    
    commit 48212542067a7ff6cbe829dbae279c2ff7557b44 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 43fe98913c9f67e3b523615ee3316f9520a623e0.
    
    This patch is very wrong. Firstly, this change leads to unbalanced
    uprobe_unregister(). Just for example,
    
            # perf probe -x /lib/libc.so.6 syscall
            # echo 1 >> /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/probe_libc/enable
            # perf record -e probe_libc:syscall whatever
    
    after that uprobe is dead (unregistered) but the user of ftrace/perf
    can't know this, and it looks as if nobody hits this probe.
    
    This would be easy to fix, but there are other reasons why it is not
    simple to mix ftrace and perf. If nothing else, they can't share the
    same ->consumer.filter. This is fixable too, but probably we need to
    fix the poorly designed uprobe_register() interface first. At least
    "register" and "apply" should be clearly separated.

    nfsd: fix rare symlink decoding bug
    
    commit 76f47128f9b33af1e96819746550d789054c9664 upstream.
    
    An NFS operation that creates a new symlink includes the symlink data,
    which is xdr-encoded as a length followed by the data plus 0 to 3 bytes
    of zero-padding as required to reach a 4-byte boundary.
    
    The vfs, on the other hand, wants null-terminated data.
    
    The simple way to handle this would be by copying the data into a newly
    allocated buffer with space for the final null.
    
    The current nfsd_symlink code tries to be more clever by skipping that
    step in the (likely) case where the byte following the string is already
    0.
    
    But that assumes that the byte following the string is ours to look at.
    In fact, it might be the first byte of a page that we can't read, or of
    some object that another task might modify.
    
    Worse, the NFSv4 code tries to fix the problem by actually writing to
    that byte.
    
    In the NFSv2/v3 cases this actually appears to be safe:
    
            - nfs3svc_decode_symlinkargs explicitly null-terminates the data
              (after first checking its length and copying it to a new
              page).
            - NFSv2 limits symlinks to 1k.  The buffer holding the rpc
              request is always at least a page, and the link data (and
              previous fields) have maximum lengths that prevent the request
              from reaching the end of a page.
    
    In the NFSv4 case the CREATE op is potentially just one part of a long
    compound so can end up on the end of a page if you're unlucky.
    
    The minimal fix here is to copy and null-terminate in the NFSv4 case.
    The nfsd_symlink() interface here seems too fragile, though.  It should
    really either do the copy itself every time or just require a
    null-terminated string.

    iio: of_iio_channel_get_by_name() returns non-null pointers for error legs
    
    commit a2c12493ed7e63a18cef33a71686d12ffcd6600e upstream.
    
    Currently in the inkern.c code for IIO framework, the function
    of_iio_channel_get_by_name() will return a non-NULL pointer when
    it cannot find a channel using of_iio_channel_get() and when it
    tries to search for 'io-channel-ranges' property and fails. This
    is incorrect behaviour as the function which calls this expects
    a NULL pointer for failure. This patch rectifies the issue.

    zram: revalidate disk after capacity change
    
    commit 2e32baea46ce542c561a519414c840295b229c8f upstream.
    
    Alexander reported mkswap on /dev/zram0 is failed if other process is
    opening the block device file.
    
    Step is as follows,
    
    0. Reset the unused zram device.
    1. Use a program that opens /dev/zram0 with O_RDWR and sleeps
       until killed.
    2. While that program sleeps, echo the correct value to
       /sys/block/zram0/disksize.
    3. Verify (e.g. in /proc/partitions) that the disk size is applied
       correctly. It is.
    4. While that program still sleeps, attempt to mkswap /dev/zram0.
       This fails: mkswap: error: swap area needs to be at least 40 KiB
    
    When I investigated, the size get by ioctl(fd, BLKGETSIZE64, xxx) on
    mkswap to get a size of blockdev was zero although zram0 has right size by
    2.
    
    The reason is zram didn't revalidate disk after changing capacity so that
    size of blockdev's inode is not uptodate until all of file is close.
    
    This patch should fix the BUG.

    This happens because init_cma_reserved_pageblock() calls
    __free_one_page() with pageblock_order as page order but it is bigger
    than MAX_ORDER.  This in turn causes accesses past zone->free_list[].
    
    Fix the problem by changing init_cma_reserved_pageblock() such that it
    splits pageblock into individual MAX_ORDER pages if pageblock is bigger
    than a MAX_ORDER page.
    
    In cases where !CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE_SIZE_VARIABLE, which is all
    architectures expect for ia64, powerpc and tile at the moment, the
    âpageblock_order > MAX_ORDERâ condition will be optimised out since both
    sides of the operator are constants.  In cases where pageblock size is
    variable, the performance degradation should not be significant anyway
    since init_cma_reserved_pageblock() is called only at boot time at most
    MAX_CMA_AREAS times which by default is eight.

    ext4: Fix hole punching for files with indirect blocks
    
    commit a93cd4cf86466caa49cfe64607bea7f0bde3f916 upstream.
    
    Hole punching code for files with indirect blocks wrongly computed
    number of blocks which need to be cleared when traversing the indirect
    block tree. That could result in punching more blocks than actually
    requested and thus effectively cause a data loss. For example:
    
    fallocate -n -p 10240000 4096
    
    will punch the range 10240000 - 12632064 instead of the range 1024000 -
    10244096. Fix the calculation.

    ext4: Fix buffer double free in ext4_alloc_branch()
    
    commit c5c7b8ddfbf8cb3b2291e515a34ab1b8982f5a2d upstream.
    
    Error recovery in ext4_alloc_branch() calls ext4_forget() even for
    buffer corresponding to indirect block it did not allocate. This leads
    to brelse() being called twice for that buffer (once from ext4_forget()
    and once from cleanup in ext4_ind_map_blocks()) leading to buffer use
    count misaccounting. Eventually (but often much later because there
    are other users of the buffer) we will see messages like:
    VFS: brelse: Trying to free free buffer
    
    Another manifestation of this problem is an error:
    JBD2 unexpected failure: jbd2_journal_revoke: !buffer_revoked(bh);
    inconsistent data on disk
    
    The fix is easy - don't forget buffer we did not allocate. Also add an
    explanatory comment because the indexing at ext4_alloc_branch() is
    somewhat subtle.

    blkcg: fix use-after-free in __blkg_release_rcu() by making blkcg_gq refcnt an atomic_t
    
    commit a5049a8ae34950249a7ae94c385d7c5c98914412 upstream.
    
    Hello,
    
    So, this patch should do.  Joe, Vivek, can one of you guys please
    verify that the oops goes away with this patch?
    
    Jens, the original thread can be read at
    
      http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1720729
    
    The fix converts blkg->refcnt from int to atomic_t.  It does some
    overhead but it should be minute compared to everything else which is
    going on and the involved cacheline bouncing, so I think it's highly
    unlikely to cause any noticeable difference.  Also, the refcnt in
    question should be converted to a perpcu_ref for blk-mq anyway, so the
    atomic_t is likely to go away pretty soon anyway.
    
    Thanks.
    
    ------- 8< -------
    __blkg_release_rcu() may be invoked after the associated request_queue
    is released with a RCU grace period inbetween.  As such, the function
    and callbacks invoked from it must not dereference the associated
    request_queue.  This is clearly indicated in the comment above the
    function.
    
    Unfortunately, while trying to fix a different issue, 2a4fd070ee85
    ("blkcg: move bulk of blkcg_gq release operations to the RCU
    callback") ignored this and added [un]locking of @blkg->q->queue_lock
    to __blkg_release_rcu().  This of course can cause oops as the
    request_queue may be long gone by the time this code gets executed.

    The request_queue locking was added because blkcg_gq->refcnt is an int
    protected with the queue lock and __blkg_release_rcu() needs to put
    the parent.  Let's fix it by making blkcg_gq->refcnt an atomic_t and
    dropping queue locking in the function.
    
    Given the general heavy weight of the current request_queue and blkcg
    operations, this is unlikely to cause any noticeable overhead.
    Moreover, blkcg_gq->refcnt is likely to be converted to percpu_ref in
    the near future, so whatever (most likely negligible) overhead it may
    add is temporary.

    commit 27e249501ca06a3010519c306206cc402b61b5ab upstream.
    
    Function dmar_iommu_notify_scope_dev() makes a wrong assumption that
    there's one RMRR for each PCI device at most, which causes DMA failure
    on some HP platforms. So enhance dmar_iommu_notify_scope_dev() to
    handle multiple RMRRs for the same PCI device.

    CIFS: fix mount failure with broken pathnames when smb3 mount with mapchars option
    
    commit ce36d9ab3bab06b7b5522f5c8b68fac231b76ffb upstream.
    
    When we SMB3 mounted with mapchars (to allow reserved characters : \ / > < * ?
    via the Unicode Windows to POSIX remap range) empty paths
    (eg when we open "" to query the root of the SMB3 directory on mount) were not
    null terminated so we sent garbarge as a path name on empty paths which caused
    SMB2/SMB2.1/SMB3 mounts to fail when mapchars was specified.  mapchars is
    particularly important since Unix Extensions for SMB3 are not supported (yet)

    b43: fix frequency reported on G-PHY with /new/ firmware
    
    commit 2fc68eb122c7ea6cd5be1fe7d6650c0beb2f4f40 upstream.
    
    Support for firmware rev 508+ was added years ago, but we never noticed
    it reports channel in a different way for G-PHY devices. Instead of
    offset from 2400 MHz it simply passes channel id (AKA hw_value).
    
    So far it was (most probably) affecting monitor mode users only, but
    the following recent commit made it noticeable for quite everybody:

    ARM: OMAP2+: Fix parser-bug in platform muxing code
    
    commit c021f241f4fab2bb4fc4120a38a828a03dd3f970 upstream.
    
    Fix a parser-bug in the omap2 muxing code where muxtable-entries will be
    wrongly selected if the requested muxname is a *prefix* of their
    m0-entry and they have a matching mN-entry. Fix by additionally checking
    that the length of the m0_entry is equal.
    
    For example muxing of "dss_data2.dss_data2" on omap32xx will fail
    because the prefix "dss_data2" will match the mux-entries "dss_data2" as
    well as "dss_data20", with the suffix "dss_data2" matching m0 (for
    dss_data2) and m4 (for dss_data20). Thus both are recognized as signal
    path candidates:
    
    Relevant muxentries from mux34xx.c:
            _OMAP3_MUXENTRY(DSS_DATA20, 90,
                    "dss_data20", NULL, "mcspi3_somi", "dss_data2",
                    "gpio_90", NULL, NULL, "safe_mode"),
            _OMAP3_MUXENTRY(DSS_DATA2, 72,
                    "dss_data2", NULL, NULL, NULL,
                    "gpio_72", NULL, NULL, "safe_mode"),
    
    This will result in a failure to mux the pin at all:
    
     _omap_mux_get_by_name: Multiple signal paths (2) for dss_data2.dss_data2
    
    Patch should apply to linus' latest master down to rather old linux-2.6
    trees.

    first page of a compound page, potentially leading to stale icache
    data residing further on in a hugetlb page.
    
    This patch addresses this issue by taking into consideration the
    order of the page when flushing the dcache.

    ARM: mvebu: Fix the improper use of the compatible string armada38x using a wildcard
    
    commit 8dbdb8e704db34085f5978c335c10256b0fb9629 upstream.
    
    Wildcards in compatible strings should be avoid. "marvell,armada38x"
    was recently introduced but was not yet used.
    
    The armada 385 SoC is a superset of the armada 380 SoC (with more CPUs
    and more PCIe slots). So this patch replaces the use of
    "marvell,armada38x" by the "marvell,armada380" string.

    commit 7cd2b0a34ab8e4db971920eef8982f985441adfb upstream.

    However, if the percpu_pagelist_fraction sysctl is set by the user, it
    is also impossible to restore it to the kernel default since the user
    cannot write 0 to the sysctl.
    
    This patch allows the user to write 0 to restore the default behavior.
    It still requires a fraction equal to or larger than 8, however, as
    stated by the documentation for sanity.  If a value in the range [1, 7]
    is written, the sysctl will return EINVAL.
    
    This successfully solves the divide by zero issue at the same time.

    hugetlb: fix copy_hugetlb_page_range() to handle migration/hwpoisoned entry
    
    commit 4a705fef986231a3e7a6b1a6d3c37025f021f49f upstream.
    
    There's a race between fork() and hugepage migration, as a result we try
    to "dereference" a swap entry as a normal pte, causing kernel panic.
    The cause of the problem is that copy_hugetlb_page_range() can't handle
    "swap entry" family (migration entry and hwpoisoned entry) so let's fix
    it.

    intel_pstate: Correct rounding in busy calculation
    
    commit 51d211e9c334b9eca3505f4052afa660c3e0606b upstream.
    
    There was a mistake in the actual rounding portion this previous patch:
    f0fe3cd7e12d (intel_pstate: Correct rounding in busy calculation) such that
    the rounding was asymetric and incorrect.
    
    Severity: Not very serious, but can increase target pstate by one extra value.
    For real world work flows the issue should self correct (but I have no proof).
    It is the equivalent of different PID gains for positive and negative numbers.
    
    Examples:
     -3.000000 used to round to -4, rounds to -3 with this patch.
     -3.503906 used to round to -5, rounds to -4 with this patch.

    All devices supported by ina2xx are bidirectional and report the

    rbd: handle parent_overlap on writes correctly
    
    commit 9638556a276125553549fdfe349c464481ec2f39 upstream.
    
    The following check in rbd_img_obj_request_submit()
    
        rbd_dev->parent_overlap <= obj_request->img_offset
    
    allows the fall through to the non-layered write case even if both
    parent_overlap and obj_request->img_offset belong to the same RADOS
    object.  This leads to data corruption, because the area to the left of
    parent_overlap ends up unconditionally zero-filled instead of being
    populated with parent data.  Suppose we want to write 1M to offset 6M
    of image bar, which is a clone of foo@snap; object_size is 4M,
    parent_overlap is 5M:
    
        rbd_data.<id>.0000000000000001
         ---------------------|----------------------|------------
        | should be copyup'ed | should be zeroed out | write ...
         ---------------------|----------------------|------------
       4M                    5M                     6M
                        parent_overlap    obj_request->img_offset
    
    4..5M should be copyup'ed from foo, yet it is zero-filled, just like
    5..6M is.
    
    Given that the only striping mode kernel client currently supports is
    chunking (i.e. stripe_unit == object_size, stripe_count == 1), round
    parent_overlap up to the next object boundary for the purposes of the
    overlap check.

    rbd: use reference counts for image requests
    
    commit 0f2d5be792b0466b06797f637cfbb0f64dbb408c upstream.
    
    Each image request contains a reference count, but to date it has
    not actually been used.  (I think this was just an oversight.) A
    recent report involving rbd failing an assertion shed light on why
    and where we need to use these reference counts.
    
    Every OSD request associated with an object request uses
    rbd_osd_req_callback() as its callback function.  That function will
    call a helper function (dependent on the type of OSD request) that
    will set the object request's "done" flag if the object request if
    appropriate.  If that "done" flag is set, the object request is
    passed to rbd_obj_request_complete().
    
    In rbd_obj_request_complete(), requests are processed in sequential
    order.  So if an object request completes before one of its
    predecessors in the image request, the completion is deferred.
    Otherwise, if it's a completing object's "turn" to be completed, it
    is passed to rbd_img_obj_end_request(), which records the result of
    the operation, accumulates transferred bytes, and so on.  Next, the
    successor to this request is checked and if it is marked "done",
    (deferred) completion processing is performed on that request, and
    so on.  If the last object request in an image request is completed,
    rbd_img_request_complete() is called, which (typically) destroys
    the image request.
    
    There is a race here, however.  The instant an object request is
    marked "done" it can be provided (by a thread handling completion of
    one of its predecessor operations) to rbd_img_obj_end_request(),
    which (for the last request) can then lead to the image request
    getting torn down.  And this can happen *before* that object has
    itself entered rbd_img_obj_end_request().  As a result, once it
    *does* enter that function, the image request (and even the object
    request itself) may have been freed and become invalid.
    
    All that's necessary to avoid this is to properly count references
    to the image requests.  We tear down an image request's object
    requests all at once--only when the entire image request has
    completed.  So there's no need for an image request to count
    references for its object requests.  However, we don't want an
    image request to go away until the last of its object requests
    has passed through rbd_img_obj_callback().  In other words,
    we don't want rbd_img_request_complete() to necessarily
    result in the image request being destroyed, because it may
    get called before we've finished processing on all of its
    object requests.
    
    So the fix is to add a reference to an image request for
    each of its object requests.  The reference can be viewed
    as representing an object request that has not yet finished
    its call to rbd_img_obj_callback().  That is emphasized by
    getting the reference right after assigning that as the image
    object's callback function.  The corresponding release of that
    reference is done at the end of rbd_img_obj_callback(), which
    every image object request passes through exactly once.

    dm thin: update discard_granularity to reflect the thin-pool blocksize
    
    commit 09869de57ed2728ae3c619803932a86cb0e2c4f8 upstream.
    
    DM thinp already checks whether the discard_granularity of the data
    device is a factor of the thin-pool block size.  But when using the
    dm-thin-pool's discard passdown support, DM thinp was not selecting the
    max of the underlying data device's discard_granularity and the
    thin-pool's block size.
    
    Update set_discard_limits() to set discard_granularity to the max of
    these values.  This enables blkdev_issue_discard() to properly align the
    discards that are sent to the DM thin device on a full block boundary.
    As such each discard will now cover an entire DM thin-pool block and the
    block will be reclaimed.

    Bluetooth: Fix deadlock in l2cap_conn_del()
    
    commit 7ab56c3a6eccb215034b0cb096e0313441cbf2a4 upstream.
    
    A deadlock occurs when PDU containing invalid SMP opcode is received on
    Security Manager Channel over LE link and conn->pending_rx_work worker
    has not run yet.
    
    When LE link is created l2cap_conn_ready() is called and before
    returning it schedules conn->pending_rx_work worker to hdev->workqueue.
    Incoming data to SMP fixed channel is handled by l2cap_recv_frame()
    which calls smp_sig_channel() to handle the SMP PDU. If
    smp_sig_channel() indicates failure l2cap_conn_del() is called to delete
    the connection. When deleting the connection, l2cap_conn_del() purges
    the pending_rx queue and calls flush_work() to wait for the
    pending_rx_work worker to complete.
    
    Since incoming data is handled by a worker running from the same
    workqueue as the pending_rx_work is being scheduled on, we will deadlock
    on waiting for pending_rx_work to complete.
    
    This patch fixes the deadlock by calling cancel_work_sync() instead of
    flush_work().

    Bluetooth: Fix check for connection encryption
    
    commit e694788d73efe139b24f78b036deb97fe57fa8cb upstream.
    
    The conn->link_key variable tracks the type of link key in use. It is
    set whenever we respond to a link key request as well as when we get a
    link key notification event.
    
    These two events do not however always guarantee that encryption is
    enabled: getting a link key request and responding to it may only mean
    that the remote side has requested authentication but not encryption. On
    the other hand, the encrypt change event is a certain guarantee that
    encryption is enabled. The real encryption state is already tracked in
    the conn->link_mode variable through the HCI_LM_ENCRYPT bit.
    
    This patch fixes a check for encryption in the hci_conn_auth function to
    use the proper conn->link_mode value and thereby eliminates the chance
    of a false positive result.

    Bluetooth: Fix SSP acceptor just-works confirmation without MITM
    
    commit ba15a58b179ed76a7e887177f2b06de12c58ec8f upstream.
    
    From the Bluetooth Core Specification 4.1 page 1958:
    
    "if both devices have set the Authentication_Requirements parameter to
    one of the MITM Protection Not Required options, authentication stage 1
    shall function as if both devices set their IO capabilities to
    DisplayOnly (e.g., Numeric comparison with automatic confirmation on
    both devices)"
    
    So far our implementation has done user confirmation for all just-works
    cases regardless of the MITM requirements, however following the

    Bluetooth: Fix incorrectly overriding conn->src_type
    
    commit b62b65055bcc5372d5c3f4103629176cb8db3678 upstream.
    
    The src_type member of struct hci_conn should always reflect the address
    type of the src_member. It should never be overridden. There is already
    code in place in the command status handler of HCI_LE_Create_Connection
    to copy the right initiator address into conn->init_addr_type.
    
    Without this patch, if privacy is enabled, we will send the wrong
    address type in the SMP identity address information PDU (it'll e.g.
    contain our public address but a random address type).

    drm/i2c: tda998x: move drm_i2c_encoder_destroy call
    
    commit 2e48cecb55435e10c93c6aface1a1c7ef32f4e71 upstream.
    
    Currently tda998x_encoder_destroy() calls cec_write() and reg_clear(),
    as part of the release procedure. Such calls need to access the I2C bus
    and therefore, we need to call them before drm_i2c_encoder_destroy()
    which unregisters the I2C device.
    
    This commit moves the latter so it's done afterwards.

    Commit "drm/vmwgfx: correct fb_fix_screeninfo.line_length", while fixing a

    SVGA_REG_BYTES_PER_LINE, while it should be (and also in fact is) written to
    SVGA_REG_PITCHLOCK.
    
    This patch is Cc'd stable because of the unknown effects writing to this
    register might have, particularly on older device versions.

    ALSA: hda - restore BCLK M/N value as per CDCLK for HSW/BDW display HDA controller
    
    commit e4d9e513dedb5ac4e166c1053314fa935ddecc8c upstream.
    
    For HSW/BDW display HD-A controller, hda_set_bclk() is defined to set BCLK
    by programming the M/N values as per the core display clock (CDCLK) queried from
    i915 display driver.
    
    And the audio driver will also set BCLK in azx_first_init() since the display
    driver can turn off the shared power in boot phase if only eDP is connected
    and M/N values will be lost and must be reprogrammed.

    drm/i915: provide interface for audio driver to query cdclk
    
    commit c149dcb5c60bfea8871f16dfcc0690255eeb825f upstream.
    
    For Haswell and Broadwell, if the display power well has been disabled,
    the display audio controller divider values EM4 M VALUE and EM5 N VALUE
    will have been lost. The CDCLK frequency is required for reprogramming them
    to generate 24MHz HD-A link BCLK. So provide a private interface for the
    audio driver to query CDCLK.
    
    This is a stopgap solution until a more generic interface between audio
    and display drivers has been implemented.

    drm/i915, HD-audio: Don't continue probing when nomodeset is given
    
    commit 74b0c2d75fb4cc89173944e6d8f9eb47aca0c343 upstream.
    
    When a machine is booted with nomodeset option, i915 driver skips the
    whole initialization.  Meanwhile, HD-audio tries to bind wth i915 just
    by request_symbol() without knowing that the initialization was
    skipped, and eventually it hits WARN_ON() in i915_request_power_well()
    and i915_release_power_well() wrongly but still continues probing,
    even though it doesn't work at all.
    
    In this patch, both functions are changed to return an error in case
    of uninitialized state instead of WARN_ON(), so that HD-audio driver
    can give up HDMI controller initialization at the right time.

    drm/i915: Avoid div-by-zero when pixel_multiplier is zero
    
    commit 2b85886a5457f5c5dbcd32edbd4e6bba0f4e8678 upstream.
    
    On certain platforms pixel_multiplier is read out in
    .get_pipe_config(), but it also gets used to calculate the
    pixel clock in intel_sdvo_get_config(). If the pipe is disable
    but some SDVO outputs are active, we may end up dividing by zero
    in intel_sdvo_get_config().
    
    To avoid the problem simply check for zero pixel_multiplier and skip
    the division. Another attempt at fixing this involved populating
    pixel_multiplier to 1 even for disabled pipes, but that triggered a
    WARN because SDVO_CMD_GET_CLOCK_RATE_MULT command failed and thus
    encoder_pixel_multiplier was left at zero and didn't match
    pipe_config->pixel_multiplier.
    
    The "divide by pixel_multiplier" operation got introduced here:

    commit 0368920e51ae0cded0eb518c340a4dd17764d461 upstream.
    
    It causes black screen on bootup and is approximately 100x slower than
    running with FBC disabled, so the GPU runs at a high frequency for much
    longer - completely contrary to the power saving claims. It also still
    has mutex deadlocks in multi-head scenarios, which can lead to a
    system/X lockup. These bugs were known before FBC was enabled by default
    on Haswell and still have not been fixed.

    If a semaphore is waiting on another ring, which in turn happens to be
    waiting on the first ring, but that second semaphore has been signalled,
    we will be able to kick the second ring and so can treat the first ring
    as a valid WAIT and not as HUNG.
    
    v2: Be paranoid and cap the potential recursion depth whilst visiting
    the semaphore signallers. (Mika)

    drm/i915/bdw: Only use 2g GGTT for 32b platforms
    
    commit 562d55d991b39ce376c492df2f7890fd6a541ffc upstream.
    
    Daniel requested in the bug that I use a 3GB fallback size. Since this
    is not in the spec as a valid size, I decided against it. We could
    potentially add a patch to bump it to 3GB on top of this one.
    
    This probably should be CC: stable - but I'll let the powers that be
    decide that one.

    drm/nv50-/mc: fix kms pageflip events by reordering irq handling order.
    
    commit dcfb1009df3b4ad8d2e0779dd45b438629d6858a upstream.
    
    Whenever a single nouveau_mc_intr() main gpu irq-handler invocation was
    responsible for calling both, the vblank-irq handler (display engine irq)
    and kms-pageflip completion handler (from fifo irq), the order of
    invocation was wrong. nouveau_finish_flip() was called before
    drm_handle_vblank() for the vblank of pageflip completion, so the
    emitted pageflip event contained stale vblank count and timestamp
    from previous vblank. This caused failure in userspace to timestamp
    properly.
    
    Reorder order of invocation of engine irq handlers: Put
    NVDEV_ENGINE_DISP always on top, and thereby before NVDEV_ENGINE_FIFO,
    so that drm_handle_vblank() gets called to update vblank timestamps
    and count before potential pageflip events make use of that
    information.
    
    This works on nv-50 and later, where kms-pageflip completion triggers
    an irq either after a separate vblank irq, or both pageflip and vblank
    trigger one common irq invocation, but never before vblank irqs.
    
    v2 (Ben):
    - removed mods for nv04-nv40, it doesn't help there anyway
    - this is considered a hack, and a better solution should be found

    mtd: pxa3xx_nand: make the driver work on big-endian systems
    
    commit b7e460624f0f3c31150f3b09e75b0d009e22ba5f upstream.
    
    The pxa3xx_nand driver currently uses __raw_writel() and __raw_readl()
    to access I/O registers. However, those functions do not do any
    endianness swapping, which means that they won't work when the CPU
    runs in big-endian but the I/O registers are little endian, which is
    the common situation for ARM systems running big endian.
    
    Since __raw_writel() and __raw_readl() do not include any memory
    barriers and the pxa3xx_nand driver can only be compiled for ARM
    platforms, the closest I/o accessors functions that do endianess
    swapping are writel_relaxed() and readl_relaxed().
    
    This patch has been verified to work on Armada XP GP: without the
    patch, the NAND is not detected when the kernel runs big endian while
    it is properly detected when the kernel runs little endian. With the
    patch applied, the NAND is properly detected in both situations
    (little and big endian).

    mtd: nand: omap: fix BCHx ecc.correct to return detected bit-flips in erased-page
    
    commit f306e8c3b667632952f1a4a74ffb910bbc06255f upstream.
    
    fixes: commit 62116e5171e00f85a8d53f76e45b84423c89ff34
           mtd: nand: omap2: Support for hardware BCH error correction.
    
    In omap_elm_correct_data(), if bitflip_count in an erased-page is within the
    correctable limit (< ecc.strength), then it is not indicated back to the caller
    ecc->read_page().
    
    This mis-guides upper layers like MTD and UBIFS layer to assume erased-page as
    perfectly clean and use it for writing even if actual bitflip_count was
    dangerously high (bitflip_count > mtd->bitflip_threshold).
    
    This patch fixes this above issue, by returning 'stats' to caller
    ecc->read_page() under all scenarios.

    mtd: eLBC NAND: fix subpage write support
    
    commit f034d87def51f026b735d1e2877e9387011b2ba3 upstream.
    
    As subpage write is enabled by default for all drivers, nand_write_subpage_hwecc
    causes a crash if the driver did not register ecc->hwctl or ecc->calculate.
    This behavior was introduced in
       commit 837a6ba4f3b6d23026674e6af6b6849a4634fff9
       "mtd: nand: subpage write support for hardware based ECC schemes".
    
    This fixes a crash by emulating subpage write support by padding sub-page data
    with 0xff on either sides to make it full page compatible.

    rt2x00: fix rfkill regression on rt2500pci
    
    commit 616a8394b5df8c88f4dd416f4527439a4e365034 upstream.
    
    As reported by Niels, starting rfkill polling during device probe
    (commit e2bc7c5, generally sane change) broke rfkill on rt2500pci
    device. I considered that bug as some initalization issue, which
    should be fixed on rt2500pci specific code. But after several
    attempts (see bug report for details) we fail to find working solution.
    Hence I decided to revert to old behaviour on rt2500pci to fix
    regression.
    
    Additionally patch also unregister rfkill on device remove instead
    of ifconfig down, what was another issue introduced by bad commit.

    usb: gadget: f_fs: fix NULL pointer dereference when there are no strings
    
    commit f0688c8b81d2ea239c3fb0b848f623b579238d99 upstream.
    
    If the descriptors do not need any strings and user space sends empty
    set of strings, the ffs->stringtabs field remains NULL.  Thus
    *ffs->stringtabs in functionfs_bind leads to a NULL pointer
    dereferenece.
    
    The bug was introduced by commit [fd7c9a007f: “use usb_string_ids_n()”].
    
    While at it, remove double initialisation of lang local variable in
    that function.
    
    ffs->strings_count does not need to be checked in any way since in
    the above scenario it will remain zero and usb_string_ids_n() is
    a no-operation when colled with 0 argument.

    Even though usb_functionfs_descs_head structure is now deprecated,
    it has been used by some user space tools.  Its removel in commit
    [ac8dde1: “Add flags to descriptors block”] was an oversight
    leading to build breakage for such tools.
    
    Bring it back so that old user space tools can still be build
    without problems on newer kernel versions.

    USB: ftdi_sio: fix null deref at port probe
    
    commit aea1ae8760314e072bf1b773521e9de5d5dda10d upstream.
    
    Fix NULL-pointer dereference when probing an interface with no
    endpoints.
    
    These devices have two bulk endpoints per interface, but this avoids
    crashing the kernel if a user forces a non-FTDI device to be probed.
    
    Note that the iterator variable was made unsigned in order to avoid
    a maybe-uninitialized compiler warning for ep_desc after the loop.

    usb: chipidea: udc: delete td from req's td list at ep_dequeue
    
    commit e4adcff09ca39ecbcc4851d40d0f0a5458e7b77a upstream.
    
    We need to delete un-finished td from current request's td list
    at ep_dequeue API, otherwise, this non-user td will be remained
    at td list before this request is freed. So if we do ep_queue->
    ep_dequeue->ep_queue sequence, when the complete interrupt for
    the second ep_queue comes, we search td list for this request,
    the first td (added by the first ep_queue) will be handled, and
    its status is still active, so we will consider the this transfer
    still not be completed, but in fact, it has completed. It causes
    the peripheral side considers it never receives current data for
    this transfer.
    
    We met this problem when do "Error Recovery Test - Device Configured"
    test item for USBCV2 MSC test, the host has never received ACK for
    the IN token for CSW due to peripheral considers it does not get this
    CBW, the USBCV test log like belows:

    usb: musb: Fix panic upon musb_am335x module removal
    
    commit 7adb5c876e9c0677078a1e1094c6eafd29c30b74 upstream.
    
    At probe time, the musb_am335x driver register its childs by
    calling of_platform_populate(), which registers all childs in
    the devicetree hierarchy recursively.
    
    On the other side, the driver's remove() function uses of_device_unregister()
    to remove each child of musb_am335x's.
    
    However, when musb_dsps is loaded, its devices are attached to the musb_am335x
    device as musb_am335x childs. Hence, musb_am335x remove() will attempt to
    unregister the devices registered by musb_dsps, which produces a kernel panic.
    
    In other words, the childs in the "struct device" hierarchy are not the same
    as the childs in the "devicetree" hierarchy.
    
    Ideally, we should enforce the removal of the devices registered by
    musb_am335x *only*, instead of all its child devices. However, because of the
    recursive nature of of_platform_populate, this doesn't seem possible.
    
    Therefore, as the only solution at hand, this commit disables musb_am335x
    driver removal capability, preventing it from being ever removed. This was
    originally suggested by Sebastian Siewior:
    
    https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-omap@vger.kernel.org/msg104946.html
    
    And for reference, here's the panic upon module removal:

    usb usb1: USB disconnect, device number 1

    usb: musb: Ensure that cppi41 timer gets armed on premature DMA TX irq
    
    commit c58d80f523ffc15ef4d062fc7aeb03793fe39701 upstream.
    
    Some TI chips raise the DMA complete interrupt before the actual
    transfer has been completed. The code tries to busy wait for a few
    microseconds and if that fails it arms an hrtimer to recheck. So far
    so good, but that has the following issue:
    
    CPU 0                                   CPU1
    
    start_next_transfer(RQ1);
    
    DMA interrupt
      if (premature_irq(RQ1))
        if (!hrtimer_active(timer))
           hrtimer_start(timer);
    
    hrtimer expires
      timer->state = CALLBACK_RUNNING;
      timer->fn()
        cppi41_recheck_tx_req()
          complete_request(RQ1);
          if (requests_pending())
            start_next_transfer(RQ2);
    
                                            DMA interrupt
                                              if (premature_irq(RQ2))
                                                if (!hrtimer_active(timer))
                                                   hrtimer_start(timer);
      timer->state = INACTIVE;
    
    The premature interrupt of request2 on CPU1 does not arm the timer and
    therefor the request completion never happens because it checks for
    !hrtimer_active(). hrtimer_active() evaluates:
    
      timer->state != HRTIMER_STATE_INACTIVE
    
    which of course evaluates to true in the above case as timer->state is
    CALLBACK_RUNNING.
    
    That's clearly documented:
    
     * A timer is active, when it is enqueued into the rbtree or the
     * callback function is running or it's in the state of being migrated
     * to another cpu.
    
    But that's not what the code wants to check. The code wants to check
    whether the timer is queued, i.e. whether its armed and waiting for
    expiry.
    
    We have a helper function for this: hrtimer_is_queued(). This
    evaluates:
    
      timer->state & HRTIMER_STATE_QUEUED
    
    So in the above case this evaluates to false and therefor forces the
    DMA interrupt on CPU1 to call hrtimer_start().
    
    Use hrtimer_is_queued() instead of hrtimer_active() and evrything is
    good.

    usb: musb: ux500: don't propagate the OF node
    
    commit 82363cf2eeafeea6ba88849f5e2febdc8a05943f upstream.
    
    There is a regression in the upcoming v3.16-rc1, that is caused
    by a problem that has been around for a while but now finally
    hangs the system. The bootcrawl looks like this:
    
    pinctrl-nomadik soc:pinctrl: pin GPIO256_AF28 already
    requested by a03e0000.usb_per5; cannot claim for musb-hdrc.0.auto
    pinctrl-nomadik soc:pinctrl: pin-256 (musb-hdrc.0.auto) status -22
    pinctrl-nomadik soc:pinctrl: could not request pin 256
    (GPIO256_AF28) from group usb_a_1  on device pinctrl-nomadik
    musb-hdrc musb-hdrc.0.auto: Error applying setting, reverse
    things back
    HS USB OTG: no transceiver configured
    musb-hdrc musb-hdrc.0.auto: musb_init_controller failed
    with status -517
    platform musb-hdrc.0.auto: Driver musb-hdrc requests
    probe deferral
    (...)
    
    The ux500 MUSB driver propagates the OF node to the dynamically
    created musb-hdrc device, which is incorrect as it makes the OF
    core believe there are two devices spun from the very same
    DT node, which confuses other parts of the device core, notably
    the pin control subsystem, which will try to apply all the pin
    control settings also to the HDRC device as it gets
    instantiated. (The OMAP2430 for example, does not set the
    of_node member.)

    xhci: Fix runtime suspended xhci from blocking system suspend.
    
    commit d6236f6d1d885aa19d1cd7317346fe795227a3cc upstream.
    
    The system suspend flow as following:
    1, Freeze all user processes and kenrel threads.
    
    2, Try to suspend all devices.
    
    2.1, If pci device is in RPM suspended state, then pci driver will try
    to resume it to RPM active state in the prepare stage.
    
    2.2, xhci_resume function calls usb_hcd_resume_root_hub to queue two
    workqueue items to resume usb2&usb3 roothub devices.
    
    2.3, Call suspend callbacks of devices.
    
    2.3.1, All suspend callbacks of all hcd's children, including
    roothub devices are called.
    
    2.3.2, Finally, hcd_pci_suspend callback is called.
    
    Due to workqueue threads were already frozen in step 1, the workqueue
    items can't be scheduled, and the roothub devices can't be resumed in
    this flow. The HCD_FLAG_WAKEUP_PENDING flag which is set in
    usb_hcd_resume_root_hub won't be cleared. Finally,
    hcd_pci_suspend will return -EBUSY, and system suspend fails.
    
    The reason why this issue doesn't show up very often is due to that
    choose_wakeup will be called in step 2.3.1. In step 2.3.1, if
    udev->do_remote_wakeup is not equal to device_may_wakeup(&udev->dev), then
    udev will resume to RPM active for changing the wakeup settings. This
    has been a lucky hit which hides this issue.
    
    For some special xHCI controllers which have no USB2 port, then roothub
    will not match hub driver due to probe failed. Then its
    do_remote_wakeup will be set to zero, and we won't be as lucky.
    
    xhci driver doesn't need to resume roothub devices everytime like in
    the above case. It's only needed when there are pending event TRBs.
    
    This patch should be back-ported to kernels as old as 3.2, that
    contains the commit f69e3120df82391a0ee8118e0a156239a06b2afb

    xhci: correct burst count field for isoc transfers on 1.0 xhci hosts
    
    commit 3213b151387df0b95f4eada104f68eb1c1409cb3 upstream.
    
    The transfer burst count (TBC) field in xhci 1.0 hosts should be set
    to the number of bursts needed to transfer all packets in a isoc TD.
    Supported values are 0-2 (1 to 3 bursts per service interval).
    
    Formula for TBC calculation is given in xhci spec section 4.11.2.3:
    TBC = roundup( Transfer Descriptor Packet Count / Max Burst Size +1 ) - 1
    
    This patch should be applied to stable kernels since 3.0 that contain
    the commit 5cd43e33b9519143f06f507dd7cbee6b7a621885

    xhci: Use correct SLOT ID when handling a reset device command
    
    commit 6fcfb0d682a8212d321a6131adc94daf0905992a upstream.
    
    Command completion events normally include command completion status,
    SLOT_ID, and a pointer to the original command. Reset device command
    completion SLOT_ID may be zero according to xhci specs 4.6.11.
    
    VIA controllers set the SLOT_ID to zero, triggering a WARN_ON in the
    command completion handler.
    
    Use the SLOT ID found from the original command instead.
    
    This patch should be applied to stable kernels since 3.13 that contain
    the commit 20e7acb13ff48fbc884d5918c3697c27de63922a

    Even though the virtio-scsi spec guarantees that all requests related
    to the TMF will have been completed by the time the TMF itself completes,
    the request queue's callback might not have run yet.  This causes requests
    to be completed more than once, and as a result triggers a variety of

    scsi_error: fix invalid setting of host byte
    
    commit 8922a908908ff947f1f211e07e2e97f1169ad3cb upstream.
    
    After scsi_try_to_abort_cmd returns, the eh_abort_handler may have
    already found that the command has completed in the device, causing
    the host_byte to be nonzero (e.g. it could be DID_ABORT).  When
    this happens, ORing DID_TIME_OUT into the host byte will corrupt
    the result field and initiate an unwanted command retry.
    
    Fix this by using set_host_byte instead, following the model of
    commit 2082ebc45af9c9c648383b8cde0dc1948eadbf31.

    SCSI: use the scsi data buffer length to extract transfer size
    
    commit 5616b0a46ed82eb9a093f752fc4d7bd3cc688583 upstream.
    
    Commit 8846bab180fa introduced a helper that can be used to query the
    wire transfer size for a SCSI command taking protection information into
    account.
    
    However, some commands do not have a 1:1 mapping between the block range
    they work on and the payload size (discard, write same). After the
    scatterlist has been set up these requests use __data_len to store the
    number of bytes to report completion on. This means that callers of
    scsi_transfer_length() would get the wrong byte count for these types of
    requests.
    
    To overcome this we make scsi_transfer_length() use the scatterlist
    length in the scsi_data_buffer as basis for the wire transfer
    calculation instead of __data_len.
