    sched: Guarantee new group-entities always have weight
    
    commit 0ac9b1c21874d2490331233b3242085f8151e166 upstream.
    
    Currently, group entity load-weights are initialized to zero. This
    admits some races with respect to the first time they are re-weighted in
    earlty use. ( Let g[x] denote the se for "g" on cpu "x". )
    
    Suppose that we have root->a and that a enters a throttled state,
    immediately followed by a[0]->t1 (the only task running on cpu[0])
    blocking:
    
      put_prev_task(group_cfs_rq(a[0]), t1)
      put_prev_entity(..., t1)
      check_cfs_rq_runtime(group_cfs_rq(a[0]))
      throttle_cfs_rq(group_cfs_rq(a[0]))
    
    Then, before unthrottling occurs, let a[0]->b[0]->t2 wake for the first
    time:
    
      enqueue_task_fair(rq[0], t2)
      enqueue_entity(group_cfs_rq(b[0]), t2)
      enqueue_entity_load_avg(group_cfs_rq(b[0]), t2)
      account_entity_enqueue(group_cfs_ra(b[0]), t2)
      update_cfs_shares(group_cfs_rq(b[0]))
      < skipped because b is part of a throttled hierarchy >
      enqueue_entity(group_cfs_rq(a[0]), b[0])
      ...
    
    We now have b[0] enqueued, yet group_cfs_rq(a[0])->load.weight == 0
    which violates invariants in several code-paths. Eliminate the
    possibility of this by initializing group entity weight.

    sched: Fix hrtimer_cancel()/rq->lock deadlock
    
    commit 927b54fccbf04207ec92f669dce6806848cbec7d upstream.
    
    __start_cfs_bandwidth calls hrtimer_cancel while holding rq->lock,
    waiting for the hrtimer to finish. However, if sched_cfs_period_timer
    runs for another loop iteration, the hrtimer can attempt to take
    rq->lock, resulting in deadlock.
    
    Fix this by ensuring that cfs_b->timer_active is cleared only if the
    _latest_ call to do_sched_cfs_period_timer is returning as idle. Then
    __start_cfs_bandwidth can just call hrtimer_try_to_cancel and wait for
    that to succeed or timer_active == 1.

    hrtimer_expires_remaining does not take internal hrtimer locks and thus

    sched: Fix race on toggling cfs_bandwidth_used
    
    commit 1ee14e6c8cddeeb8a490d7b54cd9016e4bb900b4 upstream.
    
    When we transition cfs_bandwidth_used to false, any currently
    throttled groups will incorrectly return false from cfs_rq_throttled.
    While tg_set_cfs_bandwidth will unthrottle them eventually, currently
    running code (including at least dequeue_task_fair and
    distribute_cfs_runtime) will cause errors.
    
    Fix this by turning off cfs_bandwidth_used only after unthrottling all
    cfs_rqs.
    
    Tested: toggle bandwidth back and forth on a loaded cgroup. Caused
    crashes in minutes without the patch, hasn't crashed with it.

    netfilter: nf_nat: fix access to uninitialized buffer in IRC NAT helper
    
    commit 2690d97ade05c5325cbf7c72b94b90d265659886 upstream.
    
    Commit 5901b6be885e attempted to introduce IPv6 support into
    IRC NAT helper. By doing so, the following code seemed to be removed
    by accident:
    
      ip = ntohl(exp->master->tuplehash[IP_CT_DIR_REPLY].tuple.dst.u3.ip);
      sprintf(buffer, "%u %u", ip, port);
      pr_debug("nf_nat_irc: inserting '%s' == %pI4, port %u\n", buffer, &ip, port);
    
    This leads to the fact that buffer[] was left uninitialized and
    contained some stack value. When we call nf_nat_mangle_tcp_packet(),
    we call strlen(buffer) on excatly this uninitialized buffer. If we
    are unlucky and the skb has enough tailroom, we overwrite resp. leak
    contents with values that sit on our stack into the packet and send
    that out to the receiver.
    
    Since the rather informal DCC spec [1] does not seem to specify
    IPv6 support right now, we log such occurences so that admins can
    act accordingly, and drop the packet. I've looked into XChat source,
    and IPv6 is not supported there: addresses are in u32 and print
    via %u format string.
    
    Therefore, restore old behaviour as in IPv4, use snprintf(). The
    IRC helper does not support IPv6 by now. By this, we can safely use
    strlen(buffer) in nf_nat_mangle_tcp_packet() and prevent a buffer
    overflow. Also simplify some code as we now have ct variable anyway.

    netfilter: fix wrong byte order in nf_ct_seqadj_set internal information
    
    commit 23dfe136e2bf8d9ea1095704c535368a9bc721da upstream.
    
    In commit 41d73ec053d2, sequence number adjustments were moved to a
    separate file. Unfortunately, the sequence numbers that are stored
    in the nf_ct_seqadj structure are expressed in host byte order. The
    necessary ntohl call was removed when the call to adjust_tcp_sequence
    was collapsed into nf_ct_seqadj_set. This broke the FTP NAT helper.
    Fix it by adding back the byte order conversions.

    SCSI: sd: Reduce buffer size for vpd request
    
    commit af73623f5f10eb3832c87a169b28f7df040a875b upstream.
    
    Somehow older areca firmware versions have issues with
    scsi_get_vpd_page() and a large buffer, the firmware
    seems to crash and the scsi error-handler will start endless
    recovery retries.
    Limiting the buf-size to 64-bytes fixes this issue with older
    firmware versions (<1.49 for my controller).
    
    Fixes a regression with areca controllers and older firmware versions

    clk: clk-divider: fix divisor > 255 bug
    
    commit 778037e1ccb75609846deca9e419449c1dc137fa upstream.
    
    Commit 6d9252bd9a4bb (clk: Add support for power of two type dividers)
    merged in v3.6 added the _get_val function to convert a divisor value to
    a register field value depending on the flags. However it used the type
    u8 for the div field, causing divisors larger than 255 to be masked
    and the resultant clock rate to be too high.
    
    E.g. in my case an 11bit divider was supposed to divide 24.576 MHz down
    to 32.768KHz. The divisor was correctly calculated as 750 (0x2ee). This
    was masked to 238 (0xee) resulting in a frequency of 103.26KHz.

    parisc: Ensure full cache coherency for kmap/kunmap
    
    commit f8dae00684d678afa13041ef170cecfd1297ed40 upstream.
    
    Helge Deller noted a few weeks ago problems with the AIO support on
    parisc. This change is the result of numerous iterations on how best to
    deal with this problem.
    
    The solution adopted here is to provide full cache coherency in a
    uniform manner on all parisc systems. This involves calling
    flush_dcache_page() on kmap operations and flush_kernel_dcache_page() on
    kunmap operations. As a result, the copy_user_page() and
    clear_user_page() functions can be removed and the overall code is
    simpler.
    
    The change ensures that both userspace and kernel aliases to a mapped
    page are invalidated and flushed. This is necessary for the correct
    operation of PA8800 and PA8900 based systems which do not support
    inequivalent aliases.
    
    With this change, I have observed no cache related issues on c8000 and
    rp3440. It is now possible for example to do kernel builds with "-j64"
    on four way systems.
    
    On systems using XFS file systems, the patch recently posted by Mikulas
    Patocka to "fix crash using XFS on loopback" is needed to avoid a hang
    caused by an uninitialized lock passed to flush_dcache_page() in the
    page struct.

    bridge: use spin_lock_bh() in br_multicast_set_hash_max
    
    [ Upstream commit fe0d692bbc645786bce1a98439e548ae619269f5 ]
    
    br_multicast_set_hash_max() is called from process context in
    net/bridge/br_sysfs_br.c by the sysfs store_hash_max() function.
    
    br_multicast_set_hash_max() calls spin_lock(&br->multicast_lock),
    which can deadlock the CPU if a softirq that also tries to take the
    same lock interrupts br_multicast_set_hash_max() while the lock is
    held .  This can happen quite easily when any of the bridge multicast
    timers expire, which try to take the same lock.
    
    The fix here is to use spin_lock_bh(), preventing other softirqs from
    executing on this CPU.
    
    Steps to reproduce:
    
    1. Create a bridge with several interfaces (I used 4).
    2. Set the "multicast query interval" to a low number, like 2.
    3. Enable the bridge as a multicast querier.
    4. Repeatedly set the bridge hash_max parameter via sysfs.

    net: llc: fix use after free in llc_ui_recvmsg
    
    [ Upstream commit 4d231b76eef6c4a6bd9c96769e191517765942cb ]
    
    While commit 30a584d944fb fixes datagram interface in LLC, a use
    after free bug has been introduced for SOCK_STREAM sockets that do
    not make use of MSG_PEEK.
    
    The flow is as follow ...
    
      if (!(flags & MSG_PEEK)) {
        ...
        sk_eat_skb(sk, skb, false);
        ...
      }
      ...
      if (used + offset < skb->len)
        continue;
    
    ... where sk_eat_skb() calls __kfree_skb(). Therefore, cache
    original length and work on skb_len to check partial reads.

    virtio-net: fix refill races during restore
    
    [ Upstream commit 6cd4ce0099da7702f885b6fa9ebb49e3831d90b4 ]
    
    During restoring, try_fill_recv() was called with neither napi lock nor napi
    disabled. This can lead two try_fill_recv() was called in the same time. Fix
    this by refilling before trying to enable napi.

    ipv4: fix tunneled VM traffic over hw VXLAN/GRE GSO NIC
    
    [ Upstream commit 7a7ffbabf99445704be01bff5d7e360da908cf8e ]
    
    VM to VM GSO traffic is broken if it goes through VXLAN or GRE
    tunnel and the physical NIC on the host supports hardware VXLAN/GRE
    GSO offload (e.g. bnx2x and next-gen mlx4).
    
    Two issues -
    (VXLAN) VM traffic has SKB_GSO_DODGY and SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL with
    SKB_GSO_TCP/UDP set depending on the inner protocol. GSO header
    integrity check fails in udp4_ufo_fragment if inner protocol is
    TCP. Also gso_segs is calculated incorrectly using skb->len that
    includes tunnel header. Fix: robust check should only be applied
    to the inner packet.
    
    (VXLAN & GRE) Once GSO header integrity check passes, NULL segs
    is returned and the original skb is sent to hardware. However the
    tunnel header is already pulled. Fix: tunnel header needs to be
    restored so that hardware can perform GSO properly on the original
    packet.

    vlan: Fix header ops passthru when doing TX VLAN offload.
    
    [ Upstream commit 2205369a314e12fcec4781cc73ac9c08fc2b47de ]
    
    When the vlan code detects that the real device can do TX VLAN offloads
    in hardware, it tries to arrange for the real device's header_ops to
    be invoked directly.
    
    But it does so illegally, by simply hooking the real device's
    header_ops up to the VLAN device.
    
    This doesn't work because we will end up invoking a set of header_ops
    routines which expect a device type which matches the real device, but
    will see a VLAN device instead.
    
    Fix this by providing a pass-thru set of header_ops which will arrange
    to pass the proper real device instead.
    
    To facilitate this add a dev_rebuild_header().  There are
    implementations which provide a ->cache and ->create but not a
    ->rebuild (f.e. PLIP).  So we need a helper function just like
    dev_hard_header() to avoid crashes.
    
    Use this helper in the one existing place where the
    header_ops->rebuild was being invoked, the neighbour code.
    
    With lots of help from Florian Westphal.

    net: rose: restore old recvmsg behavior
    
    [ Upstream commit f81152e35001e91997ec74a7b4e040e6ab0acccf ]
    
    recvmsg handler in net/rose/af_rose.c performs size-check ->msg_namelen.
    
    After commit f3d3342602f8bcbf37d7c46641cb9bca7618eb1c
    (net: rework recvmsg handler msg_name and msg_namelen logic), we now
    always take the else branch due to namelen being initialized to 0.
    
    Digging in netdev-vger-cvs git repo shows that msg_namelen was
    initialized with a fixed-size since at least 1995, so the else branch
    was never taken.
    
    Compile tested only.

    ipv6: always set the new created dst's from in ip6_rt_copy
    
    [ Upstream commit 24f5b855e17df7e355eacd6c4a12cc4d6a6c9ff0 ]
    
    ip6_rt_copy only sets dst.from if ort has flag RTF_ADDRCONF and RTF_DEFAULT.
    but the prefix routes which did get installed by hand locally can have an
    expiration, and no any flag combination which can ensure a potential from
    does never expire, so we should always set the new created dst's from.
    
    This also fixes the new created dst is always expired since the ort, which
    is created by RA, maybe has RTF_EXPIRES and RTF_ADDRCONF, but no RTF_DEFAULT.

    [ Upstream commit b1aac815c0891fe4a55a6b0b715910142227700f ]
    
    Jakub reported while working with nlmon netlink sniffer that parts of
    the inet_diag_sockid are not initialized when r->idiag_family != AF_INET6.
    That is, fields of r->id.idiag_src[1 ... 3], r->id.idiag_dst[1 ... 3].
    
    In fact, it seems that we can leak 6 * sizeof(u32) byte of kernel [slab]
    memory through this. At least, in udp_dump_one(), we allocate a skb in ...
    
      rep = nlmsg_new(sizeof(struct inet_diag_msg) + ..., GFP_KERNEL);
    
    ... and then pass that to inet_sk_diag_fill() that puts the whole struct
    inet_diag_msg into the skb, where we only fill out r->id.idiag_src[0],
    r->id.idiag_dst[0] and leave the rest untouched:
    
      r->id.idiag_src[0] = inet->inet_rcv_saddr;
      r->id.idiag_dst[0] = inet->inet_daddr;
    
    struct inet_diag_msg embeds struct inet_diag_sockid that is correctly /
    fully filled out in IPv6 case, but for IPv4 not.
    
    So just zero them out by using plain memset (for this little amount of
    bytes it's probably not worth the extra check for idiag_family == AF_INET).
    
    Similarly, fix also other places where we fill that out.

    ip_gre: fix msg_name parsing for recvfrom/recvmsg
    
    [ Upstream commit 0e3da5bb8da45890b1dc413404e0f978ab71173e ]
    
    ipgre_header_parse() needs to parse the tunnel's ip header and it
    uses mac_header to locate the iphdr. This got broken when gre tunneling
    was refactored as mac_header is no longer updated to point to iphdr.
    Introduce skb_pop_mac_header() helper to do the mac_header assignment
    and use it in ipgre_rcv() to fix msg_name parsing.
    
    Bug introduced in commit c54419321455 (GRE: Refactor GRE tunneling code.)

    This is similar to the set_peek_off patch where calling bind while the
    socket is stuck in unix_dgram_recvmsg() will block and cause a hung task
    spew after a while.
    
    This is also the last place that did a straightforward mutex_lock(), so
    there shouldn't be any more of these patches.

    This is because we hold the rtnl_lock() before ndo_change_mtu() and try to flush
    the work in netvsc_change_mtu(), in the mean time, netdev_notify_peers() may be
    called from worker and also trying to hold the rtnl_lock. This will lead the
    flush won't succeed forever. Solve this by not canceling and flushing the work,
    this is safe because the transmission done by NETDEV_NOTIFY_PEERS was
    synchronized with the netif_tx_disable() called by netvsc_change_mtu().

    tg3: Initialize REG_BASE_ADDR at PCI config offset 120 to 0
    
    [ Upstream commit 388d3335575f4c056dcf7138a30f1454e2145cd8 ]
    
    The new tg3 driver leaves REG_BASE_ADDR (PCI config offset 120)
    uninitialized. From power on reset this register may have garbage in it. The
    Register Base Address register defines the device local address of a
    register. The data pointed to by this location is read or written using
    the Register Data register (PCI config offset 128). When REG_BASE_ADDR has
    garbage any read or write of Register Data Register (PCI 128) will cause the
    PCI bus to lock up. The TCO watchdog will fire and bring down the system.

    inet: fix NULL pointer Oops in fib(6)_rule_suppress

    This changes ensures that the routing entry investigated by the suppress
    function actually does point to a device struct before following that pointer,
    fixing a possible kernel oops situation when verifying the interface group
    associated with a routing table entry.
    
    According to Daniel Golle, this Oops can be triggered by a user process trying
    to establish an outgoing IPv6 connection while having no real IPv6 connectivity
    set up (only autoassigned link-local addresses).

    packet: fix send path when running with proto == 0
    
    [ Upstream commit 66e56cd46b93ef407c60adcac62cf33b06119d50 ]
    
    Commit e40526cb20b5 introduced a cached dev pointer, that gets
    hooked into register_prot_hook(), __unregister_prot_hook() to
    update the device used for the send path.
    
    We need to fix this up, as otherwise this will not work with
    sockets created with protocol = 0, plus with sll_protocol = 0
    passed via sockaddr_ll when doing the bind.
    
    So instead, assign the pointer directly. The compiler can inline
    these helper functions automagically.
    
    While at it, also assume the cached dev fast-path as likely(),
    and document this variant of socket creation as it seems it is
    not widely used (seems not even the author of TX_RING was aware
    of that in his reference example [1]). Tested with reproducer
    from e40526cb20b5.

    br: fix use of ->rx_handler_data in code executed on non-rx_handler path
    
    [ Upstream commit 859828c0ea476b42f3a93d69d117aaba90994b6f ]
    
    br_stp_rcv() is reached by non-rx_handler path. That means there is no
    guarantee that dev is bridge port and therefore simple NULL check of
    ->rx_handler_data is not enough. There is need to check if dev is really
    bridge port and since only rcu read lock is held here, do it by checking
    ->rx_handler pointer.
    
    Note that synchronize_net() in netdev_rx_handler_unregister() ensures
    this approach as valid.
    
    Introduced originally by:
    commit f350a0a87374418635689471606454abc7beaa3a
      "bridge: use rx_handler_data pointer to store net_bridge_port pointer"

      "bridge: fix RCU races with bridge port"
    
    Reintroduced by:
    commit 716ec052d2280d511e10e90ad54a86f5b5d4dcc2

    macvtap: signal truncated packets
    
    [ Upstream commit ce232ce01d61b184202bb185103d119820e1260c ]
    
    macvtap_put_user() never return a value grater than iov length, this in fact
    bypasses the truncated checking in macvtap_recvmsg(). Fix this by always
    returning the size of packet plus the possible vlan header to let the trunca
    checking work.

    macvtap: Do not double-count received packets
    
    [ Upstream commit 006da7b07bc4d3a7ffabad17cf639eec6849c9dc ]
    
    Currently macvlan will count received packets after calling each
    vlans receive handler.   Macvtap attempts to count the packet
    yet again when the user reads the packet from the tap socket.
    This code doesn't do this consistently either.  Remove the
    counting from macvtap and let only macvlan count received
    packets.

    tun: unbreak truncated packet signalling
    
    [ Upstream commit e6fd07c899cd719bb5517bc7f32ce03a62220351 ]
    
    Commit 6680ec68eff47d36f67b4351bc9836fd6cba9532
    (tuntap: hardware vlan tx support) breaks the truncated packet signal by nev
    return a length greater than iov length in tun_put_user(). This patch fixes
    by always return the length of packet plus possible vlan header. Caller can
    detect the truncated packet by comparing the return value and the size of io
    length.

    net: clear local_df when passing skb between namespaces
    
    [ Upstream commit 239c78db9c41a8f524cce60507440d72229d73bc ]
    
    We must clear local_df when passing the skb between namespaces as the
    packet is not local to the new namespace any more and thus may not get
    fragmented by local rules. Fred Templin noticed that other namespaces
    do fragment IPv6 packets while forwarding. Instead they should have send
    back a PTB.
    
    The same problem should be present when forwarding DF-IPv4 packets
    between namespaces.

    rds: prevent BUG_ON triggered on congestion update to loopback
    
    [ Upstream commit 18fc25c94eadc52a42c025125af24657a93638c0 ]
    
    After congestion update on a local connection, when rds_ib_xmit returns
    less bytes than that are there in the message, rds_send_xmit calls
    back rds_ib_xmit with an offset that causes BUG_ON(off & RDS_FRAG_SIZE)
    to trigger.
    
    For a 4Kb PAGE_SIZE rds_ib_xmit returns min(8240,4096)=4096 when actually
    the message contains 8240 bytes. rds_send_xmit thinks there is more to send
    and calls rds_ib_xmit again with a data offset "off" of 4096-48(rds header)
    =4048 bytes thus hitting the BUG_ON(off & RDS_FRAG_SIZE) [RDS_FRAG_SIZE=4k].
    
    The commit 6094628bfd94323fc1cea05ec2c6affd98c18f7f
    "rds: prevent BUG_ON triggering on congestion map updates" introduced
    this regression. That change was addressing the triggering of a different
    BUG_ON in rds_send_xmit() on PowerPC architecture with 64Kbytes PAGE_SIZE:
            BUG_ON(ret != 0 &&
                     conn->c_xmit_sg == rm->data.op_nents);
    This was the sequence it was going through:
    (rds_ib_xmit)
    /* Do not send cong updates to IB loopback */
    if (conn->c_loopback
       && rm->m_inc.i_hdr.h_flags & RDS_FLAG_CONG_BITMAP) {
            rds_cong_map_updated(conn->c_fcong, ~(u64) 0);
            return sizeof(struct rds_header) + RDS_CONG_MAP_BYTES;
    }
    rds_ib_xmit returns 8240
    rds_send_xmit:
      c_xmit_data_off = 0 + 8240 - 48 (rds header accounted only the first time)
                     = 8192
      c_xmit_data_off < 65536 (sg->length), so calls rds_ib_xmit again
    rds_ib_xmit returns 8240
    rds_send_xmit:
      c_xmit_data_off = 8192 + 8240 = 16432, calls rds_ib_xmit again
      and so on (c_xmit_data_off 24672,32912,41152,49392,57632)
    rds_ib_xmit returns 8240
    On this iteration this sequence causes the BUG_ON in rds_send_xmit:
        while (ret) {
            tmp = min_t(int, ret, sg->length - conn->c_xmit_data_off);
            [tmp = 65536 - 57632 = 7904]
            conn->c_xmit_data_off += tmp;
            [c_xmit_data_off = 57632 + 7904 = 65536]
            ret -= tmp;
            [ret = 8240 - 7904 = 336]
            if (conn->c_xmit_data_off == sg->length) {
                    conn->c_xmit_data_off = 0;
                    sg++;
                    conn->c_xmit_sg++;
                    BUG_ON(ret != 0 &&
                            conn->c_xmit_sg == rm->data.op_nents);
                    [c_xmit_sg = 1, rm->data.op_nents = 1]
    
    What the current fix does:
    Since the congestion update over loopback is not actually transmitted
    as a message, all that rds_ib_xmit needs to do is let the caller think
    the full message has been transmitted and not return partial bytes.
    It will return 8240 (RDS_CONG_MAP_BYTES+48) when PAGE_SIZE is 4Kb.
    And 64Kb+48 when page size is 64Kb.

    net: do not pretend FRAGLIST support
    
    [ Upstream commit 28e24c62ab3062e965ef1b3bcc244d50aee7fa85 ]
    
    Few network drivers really supports frag_list : virtual drivers.
    
    Some drivers wrongly advertise NETIF_F_FRAGLIST feature.
    
    If skb with a frag_list is given to them, packet on the wire will be
    corrupt.
    
    Remove this flag, as core networking stack will make sure to
    provide packets that can be sent without corruption.

    IPv6: Fixed support for blackhole and prohibit routes
    
    [ Upstream commit 7150aede5dd241539686e17d9592f5ebd28a2cda ]
    
    The behaviour of blackhole and prohibit routes has been corrected by setting
    the input and output pointers of the dst variable appropriately. For
    blackhole routes, they are set to dst_discard and to ip6_pkt_discard and
    ip6_pkt_discard_out respectively for prohibit routes.
    
    ipv6: ip6_pkt_prohibit(_out) should not depend on
    CONFIG_IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES
    
    We need ip6_pkt_prohibit(_out) available without
    CONFIG_IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES
