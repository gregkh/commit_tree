    Revert "ALSA: hda: Flush interrupts on disabling"
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a7f60b9df614bb36d14dc0c0bc898a31b2b506f ]
    
    This reverts commit caa8422d01e983782548648e125fd617cadcec3f.
    
    It turned out that this commit caused a regression at shutdown /
    reboot, as the synchronize_irq() calls seems blocking the whole
    shutdown.  Also another part of the change about shuffling the call
    order looks suspicious; the azx_stop_chip() call disables the CORB /
    RIRB while the others may still need the CORB/RIRB update.
    
    Since the original commit itself was a cargo-fix, let's revert the
    whole patch.

    ALSA: timer: Fix mutex deadlock at releasing card
    
    [ Upstream commit a39331867335d4a94b6165e306265c9e24aca073 ]
    
    When a card is disconnected while in use, the system waits until all
    opened files are closed then releases the card.  This is done via
    put_device() of the card device in each device release code.
    
    The recently reported mutex deadlock bug happens in this code path;
    snd_timer_close() for the timer device deals with the global
    register_mutex and it calls put_device() there.  When this timer
    device is the last one, the card gets freed and it eventually calls
    snd_timer_free(), which has again the protection with the global
    register_mutex -- boom.
    
    Basically put_device() call itself is race-free, so a relative simple
    workaround is to move this put_device() call out of the mutex.  For
    achieving that, in this patch, snd_timer_close_locked() got a new
    argument to store the card device pointer in return, and each caller
    invokes put_device() with the returned object after the mutex unlock.

    ALSA: timer: Limit max instances per timer
    
    [ Upstream commit 9b7d869ee5a77ed4a462372bb89af622e705bfb8 ]
    
    Currently we allow unlimited number of timer instances, and it may
    bring the system hogging way too much CPU when too many timer
    instances are opened and processed concurrently.  This may end up with
    a soft-lockup report as triggered by syzkaller, especially when
    hrtimer backend is deployed.
    
    Since such insane number of instances aren't demanded by the normal
    use case of ALSA sequencer and it merely  opens a risk only for abuse,
    this patch introduces the upper limit for the number of instances per
    timer backend.  As default, it's set to 1000, but for the fine-grained
    timer like hrtimer, it's set to 100.

    xfs: Correctly invert xfs_buftarg LRU isolation logic
    
    commit 19957a181608d25c8f4136652d0ea00b3738972d upstream.
    
    Due to an inverted logic mistake in xfs_buftarg_isolate()
    the xfs_buffers with zero b_lru_ref will take another trip
    around LRU, while isolating buffers with non-zero b_lru_ref.
    
    Additionally those isolated buffers end up right back on the LRU
    once they are released, because b_lru_ref remains elevated.
    
    Fix that circuitous route by leaving them on the LRU
    as originally intended.

    sctp: not bind the socket in sctp_connect
    
    commit 9b6c08878e23adb7cc84bdca94d8a944b03f099e upstream.
    
    Now when sctp_connect() is called with a wrong sa_family, it binds
    to a port but doesn't set bp->port, then sctp_get_af_specific will
    return NULL and sctp_connect() returns -EINVAL.
    
    Then if sctp_bind() is called to bind to another port, the last
    port it has bound will leak due to bp->port is NULL by then.
    
    sctp_connect() doesn't need to bind ports, as later __sctp_connect
    will do it if bp->port is NULL. So remove it from sctp_connect().
    While at it, remove the unnecessary sockaddr.sa_family len check
    as it's already done in sctp_inet_connect.

    sctp: fix the issue that flags are ignored when using kernel_connect
    
    commit 644fbdeacf1d3edd366e44b8ba214de9d1dd66a9 upstream.
    
    Now sctp uses inet_dgram_connect as its proto_ops .connect, and the flags
    param can't be passed into its proto .connect where this flags is really
    needed.
    
    sctp works around it by getting flags from socket file in __sctp_connect.
    It works for connecting from userspace, as inherently the user sock has
    socket file and it passes f_flags as the flags param into the proto_ops
    .connect.
    
    However, the sock created by sock_create_kern doesn't have a socket file,
    and it passes the flags (like O_NONBLOCK) by using the flags param in
    kernel_connect, which calls proto_ops .connect later.
    
    So to fix it, this patch defines a new proto_ops .connect for sctp,
    sctp_inet_connect, which calls __sctp_connect() directly with this
    flags param. After this, the sctp's proto .connect can be removed.
    
    Note that sctp_inet_connect doesn't need to do some checks that are not
    needed for sctp, which makes thing better than with inet_dgram_connect.

    sch_netem: fix rcu splat in netem_enqueue()
    
    commit 159d2c7d8106177bd9a986fd005a311fe0d11285 upstream.

    Revert most of that commit, and instead make the few places that need

    The bug is that llc_sap_state_process() always takes an extra reference
    to the skb, but sometimes neither llc_sap_next_state() nor
    llc_sap_state_process() itself drops this reference.
    
    Fix it by changing llc_sap_next_state() to never consume a reference to
    the skb, rather than sometimes do so and sometimes not.  Then remove the
    extra skb_get() and kfree_skb() from llc_sap_state_process().

    dmaengine: cppi41: Fix cppi41_dma_prep_slave_sg() when idle
    
    commit bacdcb6675e170bb2e8d3824da220e10274f42a7 upstream.
    
    Yegor Yefremov <yegorslists@googlemail.com> reported that musb and ftdi
    uart can fail for the first open of the uart unless connected using
    a hub.
    
    This is because the first dma call done by musb_ep_program() must wait
    if cppi41 is PM runtime suspended. Otherwise musb_ep_program() continues
    with other non-dma packets before the DMA transfer is started causing at
    least ftdi uarts to fail to receive data.
    
    Let's fix the issue by waking up cppi41 with PM runtime calls added to
    cppi41_dma_prep_slave_sg() and return NULL if still idled. This way we
    have musb_ep_program() continue with PIO until cppi41 is awake.

    a compatible length it's still possible to overrun the buffers
    of p2pinfo since there's no check on the upper bound of noa_num.

    s390/cmm: fix information leak in cmm_timeout_handler()
    
    commit b8e51a6a9db94bc1fb18ae831b3dab106b5a4b5f upstream.
    
    The problem is that we were putting the NUL terminator too far:
    
            buf[sizeof(buf) - 1] = '\0';
    
    If the user input isn't NUL terminated and they haven't initialized the
    whole buffer then it leads to an info leak.  The NUL terminator should
    be:
    
            buf[len - 1] = '\0';

    HID: Fix assumption that devices have inputs
    
    commit d9d4b1e46d9543a82c23f6df03f4ad697dab361b upstream.
    
    The syzbot fuzzer found a slab-out-of-bounds write bug in the hid-gaff
    driver.  The problem is caused by the driver's assumption that the
    device must have an input report.  While this will be true for all
    normal HID input devices, a suitably malicious device can violate the
    assumption.
    
    The same assumption is present in over a dozen other HID drivers.
    This patch fixes them by checking that the list of hid_inputs for the
    hid_device is nonempty before allowing it to be used.

    USB: ldusb: fix ring-buffer locking
    
    commit d98ee2a19c3334e9343df3ce254b496f1fc428eb upstream.
    
    The custom ring-buffer implementation was merged without any locking or
    explicit memory barriers, but a spinlock was later added by commit
    9d33efd9a791 ("USB: ldusb bugfix").
    
    The lock did not cover the update of the tail index once the entry had
    been processed, something which could lead to memory corruption on
    weakly ordered architectures or due to compiler optimisations.
    
    Specifically, a completion handler running on another CPU might observe
    the incremented tail index and update the entry before ld_usb_read() is
    done with it.

    usb-storage: Revert commit 747668dbc061 ("usb-storage: Set virt_boundary_mask to avoid SG overflows")
    
    commit 9a976949613132977098fc49510b46fa8678d864 upstream.
    
    Commit 747668dbc061 ("usb-storage: Set virt_boundary_mask to avoid SG
    overflows") attempted to solve a problem involving scatter-gather I/O
    and USB/IP by setting the virt_boundary_mask for mass-storage devices.
    
    However, it now turns out that this interacts badly with commit
    09324d32d2a0 ("block: force an unlimited segment size on queues with a
    virt boundary"), which was added later.  A typical error message is:
    
            ehci-pci 0000:00:13.2: swiotlb buffer is full (sz: 327680 bytes),
            total 32768 (slots), used 97 (slots)
    
    There is no longer any reason to keep the virt_boundary_mask setting
    for usb-storage.  It was needed in the first place only for handling
    devices with a block size smaller than the maxpacket size and where
    the host controller was not capable of fully general scatter-gather
    operation (that is, able to merge two SG segments into a single USB
    packet).  But:
    
            High-speed or slower connections never use a bulk maxpacket
            value larger than 512;
    
            The SCSI layer does not handle block devices with a block size
            smaller than 512 bytes;
    
            All the host controllers capable of SuperSpeed operation can
            handle fully general SG;
    
            Since commit ea44d190764b ("usbip: Implement SG support to
            vhci-hcd and stub driver") was merged, the USB/IP driver can
            also handle SG.
    
    Therefore all supported device/controller combinations should be okay
    with no need for any special virt_boundary_mask.  So in order to fix
    the swiotlb problem, this patch reverts commit 747668dbc061.

    USB: gadget: Reject endpoints with 0 maxpacket value
    
    commit 54f83b8c8ea9b22082a496deadf90447a326954e upstream.
    
    Endpoints with a maxpacket length of 0 are probably useless.  They
    can't transfer any data, and it's not at all unlikely that a UDC will
    crash or hang when trying to handle a non-zero-length usb_request for
    such an endpoint.  Indeed, dummy-hcd gets a divide error when trying
    to calculate the remainder of a transfer length by the maxpacket
    value, as discovered by the syzbot fuzzer.
    
    Currently the gadget core does not check for endpoints having a
    maxpacket value of 0.  This patch adds a check to usb_ep_enable(),
    preventing such endpoints from being used.
    
    As far as I know, none of the gadget drivers in the kernel tries to
    create an endpoint with maxpacket = 0, but until now there has been
    nothing to prevent userspace programs under gadgetfs or configfs from
    doing it.

    UAS: Revert commit 3ae62a42090f ("UAS: fix alignment of scatter/gather segments")
    
    commit 1186f86a71130a7635a20843e355bb880c7349b2 upstream.
    
    Commit 3ae62a42090f ("UAS: fix alignment of scatter/gather segments"),
    copying a similar commit for usb-storage, attempted to solve a problem
    involving scatter-gather I/O and USB/IP by setting the
    virt_boundary_mask for mass-storage devices.
    
    However, it now turns out that the analogous change in usb-storage
    interacted badly with commit 09324d32d2a0 ("block: force an unlimited
    segment size on queues with a virt boundary"), which was added later.
    A typical error message is:
    
            ehci-pci 0000:00:13.2: swiotlb buffer is full (sz: 327680 bytes),
            total 32768 (slots), used 97 (slots)
    
    There is no longer any reason to keep the virt_boundary_mask setting
    in the uas driver.  It was needed in the first place only for
    handling devices with a block size smaller than the maxpacket size and
    where the host controller was not capable of fully general
    scatter-gather operation (that is, able to merge two SG segments into
    a single USB packet).  But:
    
            High-speed or slower connections never use a bulk maxpacket
            value larger than 512;
    
            The SCSI layer does not handle block devices with a block size
            smaller than 512 bytes;
    
            All the host controllers capable of SuperSpeed operation can
            handle fully general SG;
    
            Since commit ea44d190764b ("usbip: Implement SG support to
            vhci-hcd and stub driver") was merged, the USB/IP driver can
            also handle SG.
    
    Therefore all supported device/controller combinations should be okay
    with no need for any special virt_boundary_mask.  So in order to head
    off potential problems similar to those affecting usb-storage, this
    patch reverts commit 3ae62a42090f.

    fuse: flush dirty data/metadata before non-truncate setattr
    
    commit b24e7598db62386a95a3c8b9c75630c5d56fe077 upstream.
    
    If writeback cache is enabled, then writes might get reordered with
    chmod/chown/utimes.  The problem with this is that performing the write in
    the fuse daemon might itself change some of these attributes.  In such case
    the following sequence of operations will result in file ending up with the
    wrong mode, for example:
    
      int fd = open ("suid", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL);
      write (fd, "1", 1);
      fchown (fd, 0, 0);
      fchmod (fd, 04755);
      close (fd);
    
    This patch fixes this by flushing pending writes before performing
    chown/chmod/utimes.

    ath6kl: fix a NULL-ptr-deref bug in ath6kl_usb_alloc_urb_from_pipe()
    
    [ Upstream commit 39d170b3cb62ba98567f5c4f40c27b5864b304e5 ]
    
    The `ar_usb` field of `ath6kl_usb_pipe_usb_pipe` objects
    are initialized to point to the containing `ath6kl_usb` object
    according to endpoint descriptors read from the device side, as shown
    below in `ath6kl_usb_setup_pipe_resources`:
    
    for (i = 0; i < iface_desc->desc.bNumEndpoints; ++i) {
            endpoint = &iface_desc->endpoint[i].desc;
    
            // get the address from endpoint descriptor
            pipe_num = ath6kl_usb_get_logical_pipe_num(ar_usb,
                                                    endpoint->bEndpointAddress,
                                                    &urbcount);
            ......
            // select the pipe object
            pipe = &ar_usb->pipes[pipe_num];
    
            // initialize the ar_usb field
            pipe->ar_usb = ar_usb;
    }
    
    The driver assumes that the addresses reported in endpoint
    descriptors from device side  to be complete. If a device is
    malicious and does not report complete addresses, it may trigger
    NULL-ptr-deref `ath6kl_usb_alloc_urb_from_pipe` and
    `ath6kl_usb_free_urb_to_pipe`.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by preventing potential NULL-ptr-deref
    (CVE-2019-15098).

    It caught the process in the middle of trace_access_unlock(). There is
    no loop. So, it must be looping in the caller tracing_read_pipe()
    via the "waitagain" label.
    
    Crashdump analyze uncovered that iter->seq was completely zeroed
    at this point, including iter->seq.seq.size. It means that
    print_trace_line() was never able to print anything and
    there was no forward progress.
    
    The culprit seems to be in the code:
    
            /* reset all but tr, trace, and overruns */
            memset(&iter->seq, 0,
                   sizeof(struct trace_iterator) -
                   offsetof(struct trace_iterator, seq));
    
    It was added by the commit 53d0aa773053ab182877 ("ftrace:
    add logic to record overruns"). It was v2.6.27-rc1.
    It was the time when iter->seq looked like:
    
         struct trace_seq {
            unsigned char           buffer[PAGE_SIZE];
            unsigned int            len;
         };
    
    There was no "size" variable and zeroing was perfectly fine.
    
    The solution is to reinitialize the structure after or without
    zeroing.

    fs: ocfs2: fix a possible null-pointer dereference in ocfs2_info_scan_inode_alloc()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2abb7d3b12d007c30193f48bebed781009bebdd2 ]
    
    In ocfs2_info_scan_inode_alloc(), there is an if statement on line 283
    to check whether inode_alloc is NULL:
    
        if (inode_alloc)
    
    When inode_alloc is NULL, it is used on line 287:

                struct ocfs2_super *osb = OCFS2_SB(inode->i_sb);
    
    Thus, a possible null-pointer dereference may occur.
    
    To fix this bug, inode_alloc is checked on line 286.
    
    This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.

    ocfs2: clear zero in unaligned direct IO
    
    [ Upstream commit 7a243c82ea527cd1da47381ad9cd646844f3b693 ]
    
    Unused portion of a part-written fs-block-sized block is not set to zero
    in unaligned append direct write.This can lead to serious data
    inconsistencies.
    
    Ocfs2 manage disk with cluster size(for example, 1M), part-written in
    one cluster will change the cluster state from UN-WRITTEN to WRITTEN,
    VFS(function dio_zero_block) doesn't do the cleaning because bh's state
    is not set to NEW in function ocfs2_dio_wr_get_block when we write a
    WRITTEN cluster.  For example, the cluster size is 1M, file size is 8k
    and we direct write from 14k to 15k, then 12k~14k and 15k~16k will
    contain dirty data.
    
    We have to deal with two cases:
     1.The starting position of direct write is outside the file.
     2.The starting position of direct write is located in the file.
    
    We need set bh's state to NEW in the first case.  In the second case, we
    need mapped twice because bh's state of area out file should be set to
    NEW while area in file not.

    efi/x86: Do not clean dummy variable in kexec path
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ecb7402cfc7f22764e7bbc80790e66eadb20560 ]
    
    kexec reboot fails randomly in UEFI based KVM guest.  The firmware
    just resets while calling efi_delete_dummy_variable();  Unfortunately
    I don't know how to debug the firmware, it is also possible a potential
    problem on real hardware as well although nobody reproduced it.
    
    The intention of the efi_delete_dummy_variable is to trigger garbage collection
    when entering virtual mode.  But SetVirtualAddressMap can only run once
    for each physical reboot, thus kexec_enter_virtual_mode() is not necessarily
    a good place to clean a dummy object.
    
    Drop the efi_delete_dummy_variable so that kexec reboot can work.

    When using mctrl_gpio_to_gpiod, it dereferences gpios into a single
    requested GPIO.  This dereferencing can break if gpios is NULL,
    so this patch adds a NULL check before dereferencing it.  If
    gpios is NULL, this function will also return NULL.

    staging: rtl8188eu: fix null dereference when kzalloc fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 955c1532a34305f2f780b47f0c40cc7c65500810 ]
    
    If kzalloc() returns NULL, the error path doesn't stop the flow of
    control from entering rtw_hal_read_chip_version() which dereferences the
    null pointer. Fix this by adding a 'goto' to the error path to more
    gracefully handle the issue and avoid proceeding with initialization
    steps that we're no longer prepared to handle.
    
    Also update the debug message to be more consistent with the other debug
    messages in this function.

    perf jevents: Fix period for Intel fixed counters
    
    [ Upstream commit 6bdfd9f118bd59cf0f85d3bf4b72b586adea17c1 ]
    
    The Intel fixed counters use a special table to override the JSON
    information.
    
    During this override the period information from the JSON file got
    dropped, which results in inst_retired.any and similar running with
    frequency mode instead of a period.
    
    Just specify the expected period in the table.

    perf map: Fix overlapped map handling
    
    [ Upstream commit ee212d6ea20887c0ef352be8563ca13dbf965906 ]
    
    Whenever an mmap/mmap2 event occurs, the map tree must be updated to add a new
    entry. If a new map overlaps a previous map, the overlapped section of the
    previous map is effectively unmapped, but the non-overlapping sections are
    still valid.
    
    maps__fixup_overlappings() is responsible for creating any new map entries from
    the previously overlapped map. It optionally creates a before and an after map.
    
    When creating the after map the existing code failed to adjust the map.pgoff.
    This meant the new after map would incorrectly calculate the file offset
    for the ip. This results in incorrect symbol name resolution for any ip in the
    after region.
    
    Make maps__fixup_overlappings() correctly populate map.pgoff.
    
    Add an assert that new mapping matches old mapping at the beginning of
    the after map.

    Commit 8099b047ecc4 ("exec: load_script: don't blindly truncate
    shebang string") was trying to protect against a confused exec of a
    truncated interpreter path. However, it was overeager and also refused
    to truncate arguments as well, which broke userspace, and it was
    reverted. This attempts the protection again, but allows arguments to
    remain truncated. In an effort to improve readability, helper functions
    and comments have been added.

    usb: handle warm-reset port requests on hub resume
    
    [ Upstream commit 4fdc1790e6a9ef22399c6bc6e63b80f4609f3b7e ]
    
    On plug-in of my USB-C device, its USB_SS_PORT_LS_SS_INACTIVE
    link state bit is set. Greping all the kernel for this bit shows
    that the port status requests a warm-reset this way.
    
    This just happens, if its the only device on the root hub, the hub
    therefore resumes and the HCDs status_urb isn't yet available.
    If a warm-reset request is detected, this sets the hubs event_bits,
    which will prevent any auto-suspend and allows the hubs workqueue
    to warm-reset the port later in port_event.

    scripts/setlocalversion: Improve -dirty check with git-status --no-optional-locks
    
    [ Upstream commit ff64dd4857303dd5550faed9fd598ac90f0f2238 ]
    
    git-diff-index does not refresh the index for you, so using it for a
    "-dirty" check can give misleading results. Commit 6147b1cf19651
    ("scripts/setlocalversion: git: Make -dirty check more robust") tried to
    fix this by switching to git-status, but it overlooked the fact that
    git-status also writes to the .git directory of the source tree, which
    is definitely not kosher for an out-of-tree (O=) build. That is getting
    reverted.
    
    Fortunately, git-status now supports avoiding writing to the index via
    the --no-optional-locks flag, as of git 2.14. It still calculates an
    up-to-date index, but it avoids writing it out to the .git directory.
    
    So, let's retry the solution from commit 6147b1cf19651 using this new
    flag first, and if it fails, we assume this is an older version of git
    and just use the old git-diff-index method.
    
    It's hairy to get the 'grep -vq' (inverted matching) correct by stashing
    the output of git-status (you have to be careful about the difference
    betwen "empty stdin" and "blank line on stdin"), so just pipe the output
    directly to grep and use a regex that's good enough for both the
    git-status and git-diff-index version.

    sc16is7xx: Fix for "Unexpected interrupt: 8"
    
    [ Upstream commit 30ec514d440cf2c472c8e4b0079af2c731f71a3e ]
    
    The SC16IS752 has an Enhanced Feature Register which is aliased at the
    same address as the Interrupt Identification Register; accessing it
    requires that a magic value is written to the Line Configuration
    Register. If an interrupt is raised while the EFR is mapped in then
    the ISR won't be able to access the IIR, leading to the "Unexpected
    interrupt" error messages.
    
    Avoid the problem by claiming a mutex around accesses to the EFR
    register, also claiming the mutex in the interrupt handler work
    item (this is equivalent to disabling interrupts to interlock against
    a non-threaded interrupt handler).

    dm: Use kzalloc for all structs with embedded biosets/mempools
    
    [ Upstream commit d377535405686f735b90a8ad4ba269484cd7c96e ]
    
    mempool_init()/bioset_init() require that the mempools/biosets be zeroed
    first; they probably should not _require_ this, but not allocating those
    structs with kzalloc is a fairly nonsensical thing to do (calling
    mempool_exit()/bioset_exit() on an uninitialized mempool/bioset is legal
    and safe, but only works if said memory was zeroed.)

    dm snapshot: rework COW throttling to fix deadlock
    
    [ Upstream commit b21555786f18cd77f2311ad89074533109ae3ffa ]
    
    Commit 721b1d98fb517a ("dm snapshot: Fix excessive memory usage and
    workqueue stalls") introduced a semaphore to limit the maximum number of
    in-flight kcopyd (COW) jobs.
    
    The implementation of this throttling mechanism is prone to a deadlock:
    
    1. One or more threads write to the origin device causing COW, which is
       performed by kcopyd.
    
    2. At some point some of these threads might reach the s->cow_count
       semaphore limit and block in down(&s->cow_count), holding a read lock
       on _origins_lock.
    
    3. Someone tries to acquire a write lock on _origins_lock, e.g.,
       snapshot_ctr(), which blocks because the threads at step (2) already
       hold a read lock on it.
    
    4. A COW operation completes and kcopyd runs dm-snapshot's completion
       callback, which ends up calling pending_complete().
       pending_complete() tries to resubmit any deferred origin bios. This
       requires acquiring a read lock on _origins_lock, which blocks.
    
       This happens because the read-write semaphore implementation gives
       priority to writers, meaning that as soon as a writer tries to enter
       the critical section, no readers will be allowed in, until all
       writers have completed their work.
    
       So, pending_complete() waits for the writer at step (3) to acquire
       and release the lock. This writer waits for the readers at step (2)
       to release the read lock and those readers wait for
       pending_complete() (the kcopyd thread) to signal the s->cow_count
       semaphore: DEADLOCK.
    
    The above was thoroughly analyzed and documented by Nikos Tsironis as
    part of his initial proposal for fixing this deadlock, see:
    https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2019-October/msg00001.html
    
    Fix this deadlock by reworking COW throttling so that it waits without
    holding any locks. Add a variable 'in_progress' that counts how many
    kcopyd jobs are running. A function wait_for_in_progress() will sleep if
    'in_progress' is over the limit. It drops _origins_lock in order to
    avoid the deadlock.

    dm snapshot: introduce account_start_copy() and account_end_copy()
    
    [ Upstream commit a2f83e8b0c82c9500421a26c49eb198b25fcdea3 ]
    
    This simple refactoring moves code for modifying the semaphore cow_count
    into separate functions to prepare for changes that will extend these
    methods to provide for a more sophisticated mechanism for COW
    throttling.

    dm snapshot: use mutex instead of rw_semaphore
    
    [ Upstream commit ae1093be5a0ef997833e200a0dafb9ed0b1ff4fe ]
    
    The rw_semaphore is acquired for read only in two places, neither is
    performance-critical.  So replace it with a mutex -- which is more
    efficient.
