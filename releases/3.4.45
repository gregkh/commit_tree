    x86/mm: account for PGDIR_SIZE alignment
    
    Patch for -stable.  Function find_early_table_space removed upstream.
    
    Fixes panic in alloc_low_page due to pgt_buf overflow during
    init_memory_mapping.
    
    find_early_table_space sizes pgt_buf based upon the size of the
    memory being mapped, but it does not take into account the alignment
    of the memory.  When the region being mapped spans a 512GB (PGDIR_SIZE)
    alignment, a panic from alloc_low_pages occurs.
    
    kernel_physical_mapping_init takes into account PGDIR_SIZE alignment.
    This causes an extra call to alloc_low_page to be made.  This extra call
    isn't accounted for by find_early_table_space and causes a kernel panic.
    
    Change is to take into account PGDIR_SIZE alignment in find_early_table_space.

    tracing: Fix ftrace_dump()
    
    commit 7fe70b579c9e3daba71635e31b6189394e7b79d3 upstream.
    
    ftrace_dump() had a lot of issues. What ftrace_dump() does, is when
    ftrace_dump_on_oops is set (via a kernel parameter or sysctl), it
    will dump out the ftrace buffers to the console when either a oops,
    panic, or a sysrq-z occurs.
    
    This was written a long time ago when ftrace was fragile to recursion.
    But it wasn't written well even for that.
    
    There's a possible deadlock that can occur if a ftrace_dump() is happening
    and an NMI triggers another dump. This is because it grabs a lock
    before checking if the dump ran.
    
    It also totally disables ftrace, and tracing for no good reasons.
    
    As the ring_buffer now checks if it is read via a oops or NMI, where
    there's a chance that the buffer gets corrupted, it will disable
    itself. No need to have ftrace_dump() do the same.
    
    ftrace_dump() is now cleaned up where it uses an atomic counter to
    make sure only one dump happens at a time. A simple atomic_inc_return()
    is enough that is needed for both other CPUs and NMIs. No need for
    a spinlock, as if one CPU is running the dump, no other CPU needs
    to do it too.
    
    The tracing_on variable is turned off and not turned on. The original
    code did this, but it wasn't pretty. By just disabling this variable
    we get the result of not seeing traces that happen between crashes.
    
    For sysrq-z, it doesn't get turned on, but the user can always write
    a '1' to the tracing_on file. If they are using sysrq-z, then they should
    know about tracing_on.
    
    The new code is much easier to read and less error prone. No more
    deadlock possibility when an NMI triggers here.

    drm/i915: Fall back to bit banging mode for DVO transmitter detection
    
    commit e4bfff54ed3f5de88f5358504c78c2cb037813aa upstream.
    
    As discussed in this thread
    http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2013-April/037411.html
    GMBUS based DVO transmitter detection seems to be unreliable which could
    result in an unusable DVO port.
    
    The attached patch fixes this by falling back to bit banging mode for
    the time DVO transmitter detection is in progress.

    are stopped.  The host may generate a completion event with the
    completion code set to 'Stopped' or 'Stopped Invalid' when the ring is
    halted.  The current xHCI code prints a warning in that case, which can
    be really annoying if the USB device is coming into and out of suspend.
    
    Remove the unnecessary warning.

    perf/x86/intel/lbr: Fix LBR filter
    
    commit 6e15eb3ba6c0249c9e8c783517d131b47db995ca upstream.
    
    The LBR 'from' adddress is under full userspace control; ensure
    we validate it before reading from it.
    
    Note: is_module_text_address() can potentially be quite
    expensive; for those running into that with high overhead
    in modules optimize it using an RCU backed rb-tree.

    net/eth/ibmveth: Fixup retrieval of MAC address
    
    commit 13f85203e1060da83d9ec1c1c5a63343eaab8de4 upstream.
    
    Some ancient pHyp versions used to create a 8 bytes local-mac-address
    property in the device-tree instead of a 6 bytes one for veth.
    
    The Linux driver code to deal with that is an insane hack which also
    happens to break with some choices of MAC addresses in qemu by testing
    for a bit in the address rather than just looking at the size of the
    property.
    
    Sanitize this by doing the latter instead.

    autofs - remove autofs dentry mount check
    
    commit ce8a5dbdf9e709bdaf4618d7ef8cceb91e8adc69 upstream.
    
    When checking if an autofs mount point is busy it isn't sufficient to
    only check if it's a mount point.
    
    For example, if the mount of an offset mountpoint in a tree is denied
    for this host by its export and the dentry becomes a process working
    directory the check incorrectly returns the mount as not in use at
    expire.
    
    This can happen since the default when mounting within a tree is
    nostrict, which means ingnore mount fails on mounts within the tree and
    continue.  The nostrict option is meant to allow mounting in this case.

    powerpc: fix numa distance for form0 device tree
    
    commit 7122beeee7bc1757682049780179d7c216dd1c83 upstream.
    
    The following commit breaks numa distance setup for old powerpc
    systems that use form0 encoding in device tree.
    
    commit 41eab6f88f24124df89e38067b3766b7bef06ddb
    powerpc/numa: Use form 1 affinity to setup node distance
    
    Device tree node /rtas/ibm,associativity-reference-points would
    index into /cpus/PowerPCxxxx/ibm,associativity based on form0 or
    form1 encoding detected by ibm,architecture-vec-5 property.
    
    All modern systems use form1 and current kernel code is correct.
    However, on older systems with form0 encoding, the numa distance
    will get hard coded as LOCAL_DISTANCE for all nodes.  This causes
    task scheduling anomaly since scheduler will skip building numa
    level domain (topmost domain with all cpus) if all numa distances
    are same.  (value of 'level' in sched_init_numa() will remain 0)
    
    Prior to the above commit:
    ((from) == (to) ? LOCAL_DISTANCE : REMOTE_DISTANCE)
    
    Restoring compatible behavior with this patch for old powerpc systems
    with device tree where numa distance are encoded as form0.

    powerpc: Emulate non privileged DSCR read and write
    
    commit 73d2fb758e678c93bc76d40876c2359f0729b0ef upstream.
    
    POWER8 allows read and write of the DSCR in userspace. We added
    kernel emulation so applications could always use the instructions
    regardless of the CPU type.
    
    Unfortunately there are two SPRs for the DSCR and we only added
    emulation for the privileged one. Add code to match the non
    privileged one.
    
    A simple test was created to verify the fix:
    
    http://ozlabs.org/~anton/junkcode/user_dscr_test.c
    
    Without the patch we get a SIGILL and it passes with the patch.
