    x86/quirks: Reintroduce scanning of secondary buses
    
    [ Upstream commit 850c321027c2e31d0afc71588974719a4b565550 ]
    
    We used to scan secondary buses until the following commit that
    was applied in 2009:
    
      8659c406ade3 ("x86: only scan the root bus in early PCI quirks")
    
    which commit constrained early quirks to the root bus only. Its
    motivation was to prevent application of the nvidia_bugs quirk
    on secondary buses.
    
    We're about to add a quirk to reset the Broadcom 4331 wireless card on
    2011/2012 Macs, which is located on a secondary bus behind a PCIe root
    port. To facilitate that, reintroduce scanning of secondary buses.
    
    The commit message of 8659c406ade3 notes that scanning only the root bus
    "saves quite some unnecessary scanning work". The algorithm used prior
    to 8659c406ade3 was particularly time consuming because it scanned
    buses 0 to 31 brute force. To avoid lengthening boot time, employ a
    recursive strategy which only scans buses that are actually reachable
    from the root bus.
    
    Yinghai Lu pointed out that the secondary bus number read from a
    bridge's config space may be invalid, in particular a value of 0 would
    cause an infinite loop. The PCI core goes beyond that and recurses to a
    child bus only if its bus number is greater than the parent bus number
    (see pci_scan_bridge()). Since the root bus is numbered 0, this implies
    that secondary buses may not be 0. Do the same on early scanning.
    
    If this algorithm is found to significantly impact boot time or cause
    infinite loops on broken hardware, it would be possible to limit its
    recursion depth: The Broadcom 4331 quirk applies at depth 1, all others
    at depth 0, so the bus need not be scanned deeper than that for now. An
    alternative approach would be to revert to scanning only the root bus,
    and apply the Broadcom 4331 quirk to the root ports 8086:1c12, 8086:1e12
    and 8086:1e16. Apple always positioned the card behind either of these
    three ports. The quirk would then check presence of the card in slot 0
    below the root port and do its deed.

    pps: do not crash when failed to register
    
    [ Upstream commit 368301f2fe4b07e5fb71dba3cc566bc59eb6705f ]
    
    With this command sequence:
    
      modprobe plip
      modprobe pps_parport
      rmmod pps_parport
    
    the partport_pps modules causes this crash:
    
      BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at (null)
      IP: parport_detach+0x1d/0x60 [pps_parport]

      Call Trace:

        SyS_delete_module+0x187/0x210
    
    The sequence that builds up to this is:
    
     1) plip is loaded and takes the parport device for exclusive use:
    
        plip0: Parallel port at 0x378, using IRQ 7.
    
     2) pps_parport then fails to grab the device:
    
        pps_parport: parallel port PPS client
        parport0: cannot grant exclusive access for device pps_parport
        pps_parport: couldn't register with parport0
    
     3) rmmod of pps_parport is then killed because it tries to access
        pardev->name, but pardev (taken from port->cad) is NULL.
    
    So add a check for NULL in the test there too.

    libceph: apply new_state before new_up_client on incrementals
    
    [ Upstream commit 930c532869774ebf8af9efe9484c597f896a7d46 ]
    
    Currently, osd_weight and osd_state fields are updated in the encoding
    order.  This is wrong, because an incremental map may look like e.g.
    
        new_up_client: { osd=6, addr=... } # set osd_state and addr
        new_state: { osd=6, xorstate=EXISTS } # clear osd_state
    
    Suppose osd6's current osd_state is EXISTS (i.e. osd6 is down).  After
    applying new_up_client, osd_state is changed to EXISTS | UP.  Carrying
    on with the new_state update, we flip EXISTS and leave osd6 in a weird
    "!EXISTS but UP" state.  A non-existent OSD is considered down by the
    mapping code
    
    2087    for (i = 0; i < pg->pg_temp.len; i++) {
    2088            if (ceph_osd_is_down(osdmap, pg->pg_temp.osds[i])) {
    2089                    if (ceph_can_shift_osds(pi))
    2090                            continue;
    2091
    2092                    temp->osds[temp->size++] = CRUSH_ITEM_NONE;
    
    and so requests get directed to the second OSD in the set instead of
    the first, resulting in OSD-side errors like:
    
    [WRN] : client.4239 192.168.122.21:0/2444980242 misdirected client.4239.1:2827 pg 2.5df899f2 to osd.4 not [1,4,6] in e680/680
    
    and hung rbds on the client:
    
    [  493.566367] rbd: rbd0: write 400000 at 11cc00000 (0)
    [  493.566805] rbd: rbd0:   result -6 xferred 400000
    [  493.567011] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev rbd0, sector 9330688
    
    The fix is to decouple application from the decoding and:
    - apply new_weight first
    - apply new_state before new_up_client
    - twiddle osd_state flags if marking in
    - clear out some of the state if osd is destroyed

    ovl: verify upper dentry in ovl_remove_and_whiteout()
    
    [ Upstream commit cfc9fde0b07c3b44b570057c5f93dda59dca1c94 ]
    
    The upper dentry may become stale before we call ovl_lock_rename_workdir.
    For example, someone could (mistakenly or maliciously) manually unlink(2)
    it directly from upperdir.
    
    To ensure it is not stale, let's lookup it after ovl_lock_rename_workdir
    and and check if it matches the upper dentry.
    
    Essentially, it is the same problem and similar solution as in
    commit 11f3710417d0 ("ovl: verify upper dentry before unlink and rename").

    tty/vt/keyboard: fix OOB access in do_compute_shiftstate()
    
    [ Upstream commit 510cccb5b0c8868a2b302a0ab524da7912da648b ]
    
    The size of individual keymap in drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c is NR_KEYS,
    which is currently 256, whereas number of keys/buttons in input device (and
    therefor in key_down) is much larger - KEY_CNT - 768, and that can cause
    out-of-bound access when we do
    
            sym = U(key_maps[0][k]);
    
    with large 'k'.
    
    To fix it we should not attempt iterating beyond smaller of NR_KEYS and
    KEY_CNT.
    
    Also while at it let's switch to for_each_set_bit() instead of open-coding
    it.

    media: fix airspy usb probe error path
    
    [ Upstream commit aa93d1fee85c890a34f2510a310e55ee76a27848 ]
    
    Fix a memory leak on probe error of the airspy usb device driver.
    
    The problem is triggered when more than 64 usb devices register with
    v4l2 of type VFL_TYPE_SDR or VFL_TYPE_SUBDEV.
    
    The memory leak is caused by the probe function of the airspy driver
    mishandeling errors and not freeing the corresponding control structures
    when an error occours registering the device to v4l2 core.
    
    A badusb device can emulate 64 of these devices, and then through
    continual emulated connect/disconnect of the 65th device, cause the
    kernel to run out of RAM and crash the kernel, thus causing a local DOS
    vulnerability.

    [ Upstream commit e41f501d391265ff568f3e49d6128cc30856a36f ]
    
    If CONFIG_KASAN is enabled and gcc is configured with
    --disable-initfini-array and/or gold linker is used, gcc emits
    .ctors/.dtors and .text.startup/.text.exit sections instead of
    .init_array/.fini_array.  .dtors section is not explicitly accounted in
    the linker script and messes vvar/percpu layout.
    
    We want:
      ffffffff822bfd80 D _edata
      ffffffff822c0000 D __vvar_beginning_hack
      ffffffff822c0000 A __vvar_page
      ffffffff822c0080 0000000000000098 D vsyscall_gtod_data
      ffffffff822c1000 A __init_begin
      ffffffff822c1000 D init_per_cpu__irq_stack_union
      ffffffff822c1000 A __per_cpu_load
      ffffffff822d3000 D init_per_cpu__gdt_page
    
    We got:
      ffffffff8279a600 D _edata
      ffffffff8279b000 A __vvar_page
      ffffffff8279c000 A __init_begin
      ffffffff8279c000 D init_per_cpu__irq_stack_union
      ffffffff8279c000 A __per_cpu_load
      ffffffff8279e000 D __vvar_beginning_hack
      ffffffff8279e080 0000000000000098 D vsyscall_gtod_data
      ffffffff827ae000 D init_per_cpu__gdt_page
    
    This happens because __vvar_page and .vvar get different addresses in
    arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S:
    
            . = ALIGN(PAGE_SIZE);
            __vvar_page = .;
    
            .vvar : AT(ADDR(.vvar) - LOAD_OFFSET) {
                    /* work around gold bug 13023 */
                    __vvar_beginning_hack = .;
    
    Discard .dtors/.fini_array/.text.exit, since we don't call dtors.
    Merge .text.startup into init text.

    mm, compaction: prevent VM_BUG_ON when terminating freeing scanner
    
    [ Upstream commit a46cbf3bc53b6a93fb84a5ffb288c354fa807954 ]
    
    It's possible to isolate some freepages in a pageblock and then fail
    split_free_page() due to the low watermark check.  In this case, we hit
    VM_BUG_ON() because the freeing scanner terminated early without a
    contended lock or enough freepages.
    
    This should never have been a VM_BUG_ON() since it's not a fatal
    condition.  It should have been a VM_WARN_ON() at best, or even handled
    gracefully.
    
    Regardless, we need to terminate anytime the full pageblock scan was not
    done.  The logic belongs in isolate_freepages_block(), so handle its
    state gracefully by terminating the pageblock loop and making a note to
    restart at the same pageblock next time since it was not possible to
    complete the scan this time.

    mm, compaction: simplify handling restart position in free pages scanner
    
    [ Upstream commit f5f61a320bf6275f37fcabf6645b4ac8e683c007 ]
    
    Handling the position where compaction free scanner should restart
    (stored in cc->free_pfn) got more complex with commit e14c720efdd7 ("mm,
    compaction: remember position within pageblock in free pages scanner").
    Currently the position is updated in each loop iteration of
    isolate_freepages(), although it should be enough to update it only when
    breaking from the loop.  There's also an extra check outside the loop
    updates the position in case we have met the migration scanner.
    
    This can be simplified if we move the test for having isolated enough
    from the for-loop header next to the test for contention, and
    determining the restart position only in these cases.  We can reuse the
    isolate_start_pfn variable for this instead of setting cc->free_pfn
    directly.  Outside the loop, we can simply set cc->free_pfn to current
    value of isolate_start_pfn without any extra check.
    
    Also add a VM_BUG_ON to catch possible mistake in the future, in case we
    later add a new condition that terminates isolate_freepages_block()
    prematurely without also considering the condition in
    isolate_freepages().

    x86/quirks: Add early quirk to reset Apple AirPort card
    
    [ Upstream commit abb2bafd295fe962bbadc329dbfb2146457283ac ]
    
    The EFI firmware on Macs contains a full-fledged network stack for
    downloading OS X images from osrecovery.apple.com. Unfortunately
    on Macs introduced 2011 and 2012, EFI brings up the Broadcom 4331
    wireless card on every boot and leaves it enabled even after
    ExitBootServices has been called. The card continues to assert its IRQ
    line, causing spurious interrupts if the IRQ is shared. It also corrupts
    memory by DMAing received packets, allowing for remote code execution
    over the air. This only stops when a driver is loaded for the wireless
    card, which may be never if the driver is not installed or blacklisted.
    
    The issue seems to be constrained to the Broadcom 4331. Chris Milsted
    has verified that the newer Broadcom 4360 built into the MacBookPro11,3
    (2013/2014) does not exhibit this behaviour. The chances that Apple will
    ever supply a firmware fix for the older machines appear to be zero.
    
    The solution is to reset the card on boot by writing to a reset bit in
    its mmio space. This must be done as an early quirk and not as a plain
    vanilla PCI quirk to successfully combat memory corruption by DMAed
    packets: Matthew Garrett found out in 2012 that the packets are written
    to EfiBootServicesData memory (http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/11235.html).
    This type of memory is made available to the page allocator by
    efi_free_boot_services(). Plain vanilla PCI quirks run much later, in
    subsys initcall level. In-between a time window would be open for memory
    corruption. Random crashes occurring in this time window and attributed
    to DMAed packets have indeed been observed in the wild by Chris
    Bainbridge.
    
    When Matthew Garrett analyzed the memory corruption issue in 2012, he
    sought to fix it with a grub quirk which transitions the card to D3hot:
    http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grub.git/commit/?id=9d34bb85da56
    
    This approach does not help users with other bootloaders and while it
    may prevent DMAed packets, it does not cure the spurious interrupts
    emanating from the card. Unfortunately the card's mmio space is
    inaccessible in D3hot, so to reset it, we have to undo the effect of
    Matthew's grub patch and transition the card back to D0.
    
    Note that the quirk takes a few shortcuts to reduce the amount of code:
    The size of BAR 0 and the location of the PM capability is identical
    on all affected machines and therefore hardcoded. Only the address of
    BAR 0 differs between models. Also, it is assumed that the BCMA core
    currently mapped is the 802.11 core. The EFI driver seems to always take
    care of this.
    
    Michael Büsch, Bjorn Helgaas and Matt Fleming contributed feedback
    towards finding the best solution to this problem.
    
    The following should be a comprehensive list of affected models:
        iMac13,1        2012  21.5"       [Root Port 00:1c.3 = 8086:1e16]
        iMac13,2        2012  27"         [Root Port 00:1c.3 = 8086:1e16]
        Macmini5,1      2011  i5 2.3 GHz  [Root Port 00:1c.1 = 8086:1c12]
        Macmini5,2      2011  i5 2.5 GHz  [Root Port 00:1c.1 = 8086:1c12]
        Macmini5,3      2011  i7 2.0 GHz  [Root Port 00:1c.1 = 8086:1c12]
        Macmini6,1      2012  i5 2.5 GHz  [Root Port 00:1c.1 = 8086:1e12]
        Macmini6,2      2012  i7 2.3 GHz  [Root Port 00:1c.1 = 8086:1e12]
        MacBookPro8,1   2011  13"         [Root Port 00:1c.1 = 8086:1c12]
        MacBookPro8,2   2011  15"         [Root Port 00:1c.1 = 8086:1c12]
        MacBookPro8,3   2011  17"         [Root Port 00:1c.1 = 8086:1c12]
        MacBookPro9,1   2012  15"         [Root Port 00:1c.1 = 8086:1e12]
        MacBookPro9,2   2012  13"         [Root Port 00:1c.1 = 8086:1e12]
        MacBookPro10,1  2012  15"         [Root Port 00:1c.1 = 8086:1e12]

    For posterity, spurious interrupts caused by the Broadcom 4331 wireless
    card resulted in splats like this (stacktrace omitted):
    
        irq 17: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)

    net: mvneta: set real interrupt per packet for tx_done
    
    [ Upstream commit 06708f81528725148473c0869d6af5f809c6824b ]
    
    Commit aebea2ba0f74 ("net: mvneta: fix Tx interrupt delay") intended to
    set coalescing threshold to a value guaranteeing interrupt generation
    per each sent packet, so that buffers can be released with no delay.
    
    In fact setting threshold to '1' was wrong, because it causes interrupt
    every two packets. According to the documentation a reason behind it is
    following - interrupt occurs once sent buffers counter reaches a value,
    which is higher than one specified in MVNETA_TXQ_SIZE_REG(q). This
    behavior was confirmed during tests. Also when testing the SoC working
    as a NAS device, better performance was observed with int-per-packet,
    as it strongly depends on the fact that all transmitted packets are
    released immediately.
    
    This commit enables NETA controller work in interrupt per sent packet mode
    by setting coalescing threshold to 0.

    [ Upstream commit a8ff48cb70835f48de5703052760312019afea55 ]
    
    The chmap ctls assigned to PCM streams are freed in the PCM disconnect
    callback.  However, since the disconnect callback isn't called when
    the card gets freed before registering, the chmap ctls may still be
    left assigned.  They are eventually freed together with other ctls,
    but it may cause an Oops at pcm_chmap_ctl_private_free(), as the
    function refers to the assigned PCM stream, while the PCM objects have
    been already freed beforehand.
    
    The fix is to free the chmap ctls also at PCM free callback, not only
    at PCM disconnect.

    ALSA: ctl: Stop notification after disconnection
    
    [ Upstream commit f388cdcdd160687c6650833f286b9c89c50960ff ]
    
    snd_ctl_remove() has a notification for the removal event.  It's
    superfluous when done during the device got disconnected.  Although
    the notification itself is mostly harmless, it may potentially be
    harmful, and should be suppressed.  Actually some components PCM may
    free ctl elements during the disconnect or free callbacks, thus it's
    no theoretical issue.
    
    This patch adds the check of card->shutdown flag for avoiding
    unnecessary notifications after (or during) the disconnect.

    ovl: Copy up underlying inode's ->i_mode to overlay inode
    
    [ Upstream commit 07a2daab49c549a37b5b744cbebb6e3f445f12bc ]
    
    Right now when a new overlay inode is created, we initialize overlay
    inode's ->i_mode from underlying inode ->i_mode but we retain only
    file type bits (S_IFMT) and discard permission bits.
    
    This patch changes it and retains permission bits too. This should allow
    overlay to do permission checks on overlay inode itself in task context.
    
    [SzM] It also fixes clearing suid/sgid bits on write.

    ovl: handle ATTR_KILL*
    
    [ Upstream commit 51234eac5dd8b5feda9a3a8fa766f5398ecf91e3 ]
    
    commit b99c2d913810e56682a538c9f2394d76fca808f8 upstream.
    
    Before 4bacc9c9234c ("overlayfs: Make f_path...") file->f_path pointed to
    the underlying file, hence suid/sgid removal on write worked fine.
    
    After that patch file->f_path pointed to the overlay file, and the file
    mode bits weren't copied to overlay_inode->i_mode.  So the suid/sgid
    removal simply stopped working.
    
    The fix is to copy the mode bits, but then ovl_setattr() needs to clear
    ATTR_MODE to avoid the BUG() in notify_change().  So do this first, then in
    the next patch copy the mode.

    ARM: mvebu: fix HW I/O coherency related deadlocks
    
    [ Upstream commit c5379ba8fccd99d5f99632c789f0393d84a57805 ]
    
    Until now, our understanding for HW I/O coherency to work on the
    Cortex-A9 based Marvell SoC was that only the PCIe regions should be
    mapped strongly-ordered. However, we were still encountering some
    deadlocks, especially when testing the CESA crypto engine. After
    checking with the HW designers, it was concluded that all the MMIO
    registers should be mapped as strongly ordered for the HW I/O coherency
    mechanism to work properly.
    
    This fixes some easy to reproduce deadlocks with the CESA crypto engine
    driver (dmcrypt on a sufficiently large disk partition).

    netfilter: x_tables: speed up jump target validation
    
    [ Upstream commit f4dc77713f8016d2e8a3295e1c9c53a21f296def ]
    
    The dummy ruleset I used to test the original validation change was broken,
    most rules were unreachable and were not tested by mark_source_chains().
    
    In some cases rulesets that used to load in a few seconds now require
    several minutes.
    
    sample ruleset that shows the behaviour:
    
    echo "*filter"
    for i in $(seq 0 100000);do
            printf ":chain_%06x - [0:0]\n" $i
    done
    for i in $(seq 0 100000);do
       printf -- "-A INPUT -j chain_%06x\n" $i
       printf -- "-A INPUT -j chain_%06x\n" $i
       printf -- "-A INPUT -j chain_%06x\n" $i
    done
    echo COMMIT
    
    [ pipe result into iptables-restore ]
    
    This ruleset will be about 74mbyte in size, with ~500k searches
    though all 500k[1] rule entries. iptables-restore will take forever
    (gave up after 10 minutes)
    
    Instead of always searching the entire blob for a match, fill an
    array with the start offsets of every single ipt_entry struct,
    then do a binary search to check if the jump target is present or not.
    
    After this change ruleset restore times get again close to what one
    gets when reverting 36472341017529e (~3 seconds on my workstation).
    
    [1] every user-defined rule gets an implicit RETURN, so we get
    300k jumps + 100k userchains + 100k returns -> 500k rule entries
