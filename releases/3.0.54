    Some bcm5974 trackpads have a physical button beneath the physical surface.
    This patch sets the property bit so user space applications can detect the

    x86, mce, therm_throt: Don't report power limit and package level thermal throttle events in mcelog
    
    commit 29e9bf1841e4f9df13b4992a716fece7087dd237 upstream.
    
    Thermal throttle and power limit events are not defined as MCE errors in x86
    architecture and should not generate MCE errors in mcelog.
    
    Current kernel generates fake software defined MCE errors for these events.
    This may confuse users because they may think the machine has real MCE errors
    while actually only thermal throttle or power limit events happen.
    
    To make it worse, buggy firmware on some platforms may falsely generate
    the events. Therefore, kernel reports MCE errors which users think as real
    hardware errors. Although the firmware bugs should be fixed, on the other hand,
    kernel should not report MCE errors either.
    
    So mcelog is not a good mechanism to report these events. To report the events, we count them in respective counters (core_power_limit_count,
    package_power_limit_count, core_throttle_count, and package_throttle_count) in
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/thermal_throttle/. Users can check the counters
    for each event on each CPU. Please note that all CPU's on one package report
    duplicate counters. It's user application's responsibity to retrieve a package
    level counter for one package.
    
    This patch doesn't report package level power limit, core level power limit, and
    package level thermal throttle events in mcelog. When the events happen, only
    report them in respective counters in sysfs.
    
    Since core level thermal throttle has been legacy code in kernel for a while and
    users accepted it as MCE error in mcelog, core level thermal throttle is still
    reported in mcelog. In the mean time, the event is counted in a counter in sysfs
    as well.

    watchdog: using u64 in get_sample_period()
    
    commit 8ffeb9b0e6369135bf03a073514f571ef10606b9 upstream.
    
    In get_sample_period(), unsigned long is not enough:
    
      watchdog_thresh * 2 * (NSEC_PER_SEC / 5)
    
    case1:
      watchdog_thresh is 10 by default, the sample value will be: 0xEE6B2800
    
    case2:
     set watchdog_thresh is 20, the sample value will be: 0x1 DCD6 5000
    
    In case2, we need use u64 to express the sample period.  Otherwise,
    changing the threshold thru proc often can not be successful.

    USB: mct_u232: fix broken close
    
    commit 5260e458f5eff269a43e4f1e9c47186c57b88ddb upstream.
    
    Make sure generic close is called at close.
    
    The driver relies on the generic write implementation but did not call
    generic close.
    
    Note that the call to kill the read urb is not redundant, as mct_u232
    uses an interrupt urb from the second port as the read urb and that
    generic close therefore fails to kill it.
    
    Compile-only tested.

    bas_gigaset: fix pre_reset handling
    
    commit c6fdd8e5d0c65bb8821dc6da26ee1a2ddd58b3cc upstream.
    
    The delayed work function int_in_work() may call usb_reset_device()
    and thus, indirectly, the driver's pre_reset method. Trying to
    cancel the work synchronously in that situation would deadlock.
    Fix by avoiding cancel_work_sync() in the pre_reset method.
    
    If the reset was NOT initiated by int_in_work() this might cause
    int_in_work() to run after the post_reset method, with urb_int_in
    already resubmitted, so handle that case gracefully.

    sparc64: not any error from do_sigaltstack() should fail rt_sigreturn()
    
    commit fae2ae2a900a5c7bb385fe4075f343e7e2d5daa2 upstream.
    
    If a signal handler is executed on altstack and another signal comes,
    we will end up with rt_sigreturn() on return from the second handler
    getting -EPERM from do_sigaltstack().  It's perfectly OK, since we
    are not asking to change the settings; in fact, they couldn't have been
    changed during the second handler execution exactly because we'd been
    on altstack all along.  64bit sigreturn on sparc treats any error from
    do_sigaltstack() as "SIGSEGV now"; we need to switch to the same semantics
    we are using on other architectures.

    Commit 09e05d48 introduced a wait for transaction commit into
    journal_unmap_buffer() in the case we are truncating a buffer undergoing commit
    in the page stradding i_size on a filesystem with blocksize < pagesize. Sadly
    we forgot to drop buffer lock before waiting for transaction commit and thus
    deadlock is possible when kjournald wants to lock the buffer.
    
    Fix the problem by dropping the buffer lock before waiting for transaction
    commit. Since we are still holding page lock (and that is OK), buffer cannot
    disappear under us.

    The check whether the IBSS is active and can be removed should be

    futex: avoid wake_futex() for a PI futex_q
    
    commit aa10990e028cac3d5e255711fb9fb47e00700e35 upstream.
    
    Dave Jones reported a bug with futex_lock_pi() that his trinity test
    exposed.  Sometime between queue_me() and taking the q.lock_ptr, the
    lock_ptr became NULL, resulting in a crash.
    
    While futex_wake() is careful to not call wake_futex() on futex_q's with
    a pi_state or an rt_waiter (which are either waiting for a
    futex_unlock_pi() or a PI futex_requeue()), futex_wake_op() and
    futex_requeue() do not perform the same test.
    
    Update futex_wake_op() and futex_requeue() to test for q.pi_state and
    q.rt_waiter and abort with -EINVAL if detected.  To ensure any future
    breakage is caught, add a WARN() to wake_futex() if the same condition
    is true.
    
    This fix has seen 3 hours of testing with "trinity -c futex" on an
    x86_64 VM with 4 CPUS.

    dm: fix deadlock with request based dm and queue request_fn recursion
    
    commit a8c32a5c98943d370ea606a2e7dc04717eb92206 upstream.
    
    Request based dm attempts to re-run the request queue off the
    request completion path. If used with a driver that potentially does
    end_io from its request_fn, we could deadlock trying to recurse
    back into request dispatch. Fix this by punting the request queue
    run to kblockd.
    
    Tested to fix a quickly reproducible deadlock in such a scenario.

    This turns out to be correct and we need to pay attention to the pgoff as
    well as the address when creating the virtual address for the area.
    Fortunately, the bug is rarely triggered as most applications which use pgoff
    tend to use large values (git being the primary one, and it uses pgoff in
    multiples of 16MB) which are larger than our cache coherency modulus, so the
    problem isn't often seen in practise.

    ALSA: ua101, usx2y: fix broken MIDI output
    
    commit e99ddfde6ae0dd2662bb40435696002b590e4057 upstream.
    
    Commit 88a8516a2128 (ALSA: usbaudio: implement USB autosuspend) added
    autosuspend code to all files making up the snd-usb-audio driver.
    However, midi.c is part of snd-usb-lib and is also used by other
    drivers, not all of which support autosuspend.  Thus, calls to
    usb_autopm_get_interface() could fail, and this unexpected error would
    result in the MIDI output being completely unusable.
    
    Make it work by ignoring the error that is expected with drivers that do
    not support autosuspend.

    In the frame handler routine response (FIS 0x34) was copied into wrong

    x86-32: Fix invalid stack address while in softirq
    
    commit 1022623842cb72ee4d0dbf02f6937f38c92c3f41 upstream.
    
    In 32 bit the stack address provided by kernel_stack_pointer() may
    point to an invalid range causing NULL pointer access or page faults
    while in NMI (see trace below). This happens if called in softirq
    context and if the stack is empty. The address at &regs->sp is then
    out of range.
    
    Fixing this by checking if regs and &regs->sp are in the same stack
    context. Otherwise return the previous stack pointer stored in struct
    thread_info. If that address is invalid too, return address of regs.
