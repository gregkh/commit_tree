    powerpc/preempt: Don't touch the idle task's preempt_count during hotplug
    
    commit 2c669ef6979c370f98d4b876e54f19613c81e075 upstream.
    
    Powerpc currently resets a CPU's idle task preempt_count to 0 before
    said task starts executing the secondary startup routine (and becomes an
    idle task proper).
    
    This conflicts with commit f1a0a376ca0c ("sched/core: Initialize the
    idle task with preemption disabled").
    
    which initializes all of the idle tasks' preempt_count to
    PREEMPT_DISABLED during smp_init(). Note that this was superfluous
    before said commit, as back then the hotplug machinery would invoke
    init_idle() via idle_thread_get(), which would have already reset the
    CPU's idle task's preempt_count to PREEMPT_ENABLED.
    
    Get rid of this preempt_count write.

    iommu/dma: Fix compile warning in 32-bit builds
    
    commit 7154cbd31c2069726cf730b0ed94e2e79a221602 upstream.

    sched: Stop PF_NO_SETAFFINITY from being inherited by various init system threads
    
    commit a8ea6fc9b089156d9230bfeef964dd9be101a4a9 upstream.
    
    Commit:
    
      00b89fe0197f ("sched: Make the idle task quack like a per-CPU kthread")
    
    ... added PF_KTHREAD | PF_NO_SETAFFINITY to the idle kernel threads.
    
    Unfortunately these properties are inherited to the init/0 children
    through kernel_thread() calls: init/1 and kthreadd. There are several
    side effects to that:
    
    1) kthreadd affinity can not be reset anymore from userspace. Also
       PF_NO_SETAFFINITY propagates to all kthreadd children, including
       the unbound kthreads Therefore it's not possible anymore to overwrite
       the affinity of any of them. Here is an example of warning reported
       by rcutorture:
    
                    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 116 at kernel/rcu/tree_nocb.h:1306 rcu_bind_current_to_nocb+0x31/0x40
                    Call Trace:
                     rcu_torture_fwd_prog+0x62/0x730
                     kthread+0x122/0x140
                     ret_from_fork+0x22/0x30
    
    2) init/1 does an exec() in the end which clears both
       PF_KTHREAD and PF_NO_SETAFFINITY so we are fine once kernel_init()
       escapes to userspace. But until then, no initcall or init code can
       successfully call sched_setaffinity() to init/1.
    
       Also PF_KTHREAD looks legit on init/1 before it calls exec() but
       we better be careful with unknown introduced side effects.
    
    One way to solve the PF_NO_SETAFFINITY issue is to not inherit this flag
    on copy_process() at all. The cases where it matters are:
    
    * fork_idle(): explicitly set the flag already.
    * fork() syscalls: userspace tasks that shouldn't be concerned by that.
    * create_io_thread(): the callers explicitly attribute the flag to the
                          newly created tasks.
    * kernel_thread():
            - Fix the issues on init/1 and kthreadd
            - Fix the issues on kthreadd children.
            - Usermode helper created by an unbound workqueue. This shouldn't
              matter. In the worst case it gives more control to userspace
              on setting affinity to these short living tasks although this can
              be tuned with inherited unbound workqueues affinity already.

    s390: preempt: Fix preempt_count initialization
    
    commit 6a942f5780545ebd11aca8b3ac4b163397962322 upstream.
    
    S390's init_idle_preempt_count(p, cpu) doesn't actually let us initialize the
    preempt_count of the requested CPU's idle task: it unconditionally writes
    to the current CPU's. This clearly conflicts with idle_threads_init(),
    which intends to initialize *all* the idle tasks, including their
    preempt_count (or their CPU's, if the arch uses a per-CPU preempt_count).
    
    Unfortunately, it seems the way s390 does things doesn't let us initialize
    every possible CPU's preempt_count early on, as the pages where this
    resides are only allocated when a CPU is brought up and are freed when it
    is brought down.
    
    Let the arch-specific code set a CPU's preempt_count when its lowcore is
    allocated, and turn init_idle_preempt_count() into an empty stub.

    commit 70b52f09080565030a530a784f1c9948a7f48ca3 upstream.
    
    According to the eMMC Spec:
    "When command queuing is enabled (CMDQ Mode En bit in CMDQ_MODE_EN
    field is set to ‘1’) class 11 commands are the only method through
    which data transfer tasks can be issued. Existing data transfer
    commands, namely CMD18/CMD17 and CMD25/CMD24, are not supported when
    command queuing is enabled."
    which means if CMDQ is enabled, the FFU commands will not be supported.
    To fix this issue, just simply disable CMDQ on the ioctl path, and
    re-enable CMDQ once ioctl request is completed.

    io_uring: fix blocking inline submission
    
    commit 976517f162a05f4315b2373fd11585c395506259 upstream.
    
    There is a complaint against sys_io_uring_enter() blocking if it submits
    stdin reads. The problem is in __io_file_supports_async(), which
    sees that it's a cdev and allows it to be processed inline.
    
    Punt char devices using generic rules of io_file_supports_async(),
    including checking for presence of *_iter() versions of rw callbacks.
    Apparently, it will affect most of cdevs with some exceptions like
    null and zero devices.

    block: return the correct bvec when checking for gaps
    
    commit c9c9762d4d44dcb1b2ba90cfb4122dc11ceebf31 upstream.
    
    After commit 07173c3ec276 ("block: enable multipage bvecs"), a bvec can
    have multiple pages. But bio_will_gap() still assumes one page bvec while
    checking for merging. If the pages in the bvec go across the
    seg_boundary_mask, this check for merging can potentially succeed if only
    the 1st page is tested, and can fail if all the pages are tested.
    
    Later, when SCSI builds the SG list the same check for merging is done in
    __blk_segment_map_sg_merge() with all the pages in the bvec tested. This
    time the check may fail if the pages in bvec go across the
    seg_boundary_mask (but tested okay in bio_will_gap() earlier, so those
    BIOs were merged). If this check fails, we end up with a broken SG list
    for drivers assuming the SG list not having offsets in intermediate pages.
    This results in incorrect pages written to the disk.
    
    Fix this by returning the multi-page bvec when testing gaps for merging.

    Do not tear down the system when getting invalid status from a TPM chip.
    This can happen when panic-on-warn is used.
    
    Instead, introduce TPM_TIS_INVALID_STATUS bitflag and use it to trigger
    once the error reporting per chip. In addition, print out the value of
    TPM_STS for improved forensics.

    fscrypt: fix derivation of SipHash keys on big endian CPUs
    
    commit 2fc2b430f559fdf32d5d1dd5ceaa40e12fb77bdf upstream.
    
    Typically, the cryptographic APIs that fscrypt uses take keys as byte
    arrays, which avoids endianness issues.  However, siphash_key_t is an
    exception.  It is defined as 'u64 key[2];', i.e. the 128-bit key is
    expected to be given directly as two 64-bit words in CPU endianness.
    
    fscrypt_derive_dirhash_key() and fscrypt_setup_iv_ino_lblk_32_key()
    forgot to take this into account.  Therefore, the SipHash keys used to
    index encrypted+casefolded directories differ on big endian vs. little
    endian platforms, as do the SipHash keys used to hash inode numbers for
    IV_INO_LBLK_32-encrypted directories.  This makes such directories
    non-portable between these platforms.
    
    Fix this by always using the little endian order.  This is a breaking
    change for big endian platforms, but this should be fine in practice
    since these features (encrypt+casefold support, and the IV_INO_LBLK_32
    flag) aren't known to actually be used on any big endian platforms yet.

    fscrypt: don't ignore minor_hash when hash is 0
    
    commit 77f30bfcfcf484da7208affd6a9e63406420bf91 upstream.
    
    When initializing a no-key name, fscrypt_fname_disk_to_usr() sets the
    minor_hash to 0 if the (major) hash is 0.
    
    This doesn't make sense because 0 is a valid hash code, so we shouldn't
    ignore the filesystem-provided minor_hash in that case.  Fix this by
    removing the special case for 'hash == 0'.
    
    This is an old bug that appears to have originated when the encryption
    code in ext4 and f2fs was moved into fs/crypto/.  The original ext4 and
    f2fs code passed the hash by pointer instead of by value.  So
    'if (hash)' actually made sense then, as it was checking whether a
    pointer was NULL.  But now the hashes are passed by value, and
    filesystems just pass 0 for any hashes they don't have.  There is no
    need to handle this any differently from the hashes actually being 0.
    
    It is difficult to reproduce this bug, as it only made a difference in
    the case where a filename's 32-bit major hash happened to be 0.
    However, it probably had the largest chance of causing problems on
    ubifs, since ubifs uses minor_hash to do lookups of no-key names, in
    addition to using it as a readdir cookie.  ext4 only uses minor_hash as
    a readdir cookie, and f2fs doesn't use minor_hash at all.

    scsi: lpfc: Fix Node recovery when driver is handling simultaneous PLOGIs
    
    commit 4012baeab6ca22b7f7beb121b6d0da0a62942fdd upstream.
    
    When lpfc is handling a solicited and unsolicited PLOGI with another
    initiator, the remote initiator is never recovered. The node for the
    initiator is erroneouosly removed and all resources released.
    
    In lpfc_cmpl_els_plogi(), when lpfc_els_retry() returns a failure code, the
    driver is calling the state machine with a device remove event because the
    remote port is not currently registered with the SCSI or NVMe
    transports. The issue is that on a PLOGI "collision" the driver correctly
    aborts the solicited PLOGI and allows the unsolicited PLOGI to complete the
    process, but this process is interrupted with a device_rm event.
    
    Introduce logic in the PLOGI completion to capture the PLOGI collision
    event and jump out of the routine.  This will avoid removal of the node.
    If there is no collision, the normal node removal will occur.

    scsi: lpfc: Fix unreleased RPIs when NPIV ports are created
    
    commit 01131e7aae5d30e23e3cdd1eebe51bbc5489ae8f upstream.
    
    While testing NPIV and watching logins and used RPI levels, it was seen the
    used RPI count was much higher than the number of remote ports discovered.
    
    Code inspection showed that remote port removals on any NPIV instance are
    releasing the RPI, but not performing an UNREG_RPI with the adapter thus
    the reference counting never fully drops and the RPI is never fully
    released. This was happening on NPIV nodes due to a log of fabric ELS's to
    fabric addresses. This lack of UNREG_RPI was introduced by a prior node
    rework patch that performed the UNREG_RPI as part of node cleanup.
    
    To resolve the issue, do the following:
    
     - Restore the RPI release code, but move the location to so that it is in
       line with the new node cleanup design.
    
     - NPIV ports now release the RPI and drop the node when the caller sets
       the NLP_RELEASE_RPI flag.
    
     - Set the NLP_RELEASE_RPI flag in node cleanup which will trigger a
       release of RPI to free pool.
    
     - Ensure there's an UNREG_RPI at LOGO completion so that RPI release is
       completed.
    
     - Stop offline_prep from skipping nodes that are UNUSED. The RPI may
       not have been released.
    
     - Stop the default RPI handling in lpfc_cmpl_els_rsp() for SLI4.
    
     - Fixed up debugfs RPI displays for better debugging.

    exceeds any limit, the DataLength in stream entry of the directory is
    no longer updated. So some files created from camera does not show in
    linux exfat. because linux exfat doesn't allow that cpos becomes larger
    than DataLength of stream entry. This patch check DataLength in stream
    entry only if the type is ALLOC_NO_FAT_CHAIN and add the check ensure
    that dentry offset does not exceed max dentries size(256 MB) to avoid
    the circular FAT chain issue.

    selftests/vm/pkeys: refill shadow register after implicit kernel write
    
    [ Upstream commit 6039ca254979694c5362dfebadd105e286c397bb ]
    
    The pkey test code keeps a "shadow" of the pkey register around.  This
    ensures that any bugs which might write to the register can be caught more
    quickly.
    
    Generally, userspace has a good idea when the kernel is going to write to
    the register.  For instance, alloc_pkey() is passed a permission mask.
    The caller of alloc_pkey() can update the shadow based on the return value
    and the mask.
    
    But, the kernel can also modify the pkey register in a more sneaky way.
    For mprotect(PROT_EXEC) mappings, the kernel will allocate a pkey and
    write the pkey register to create an execute-only mapping.  The kernel
    never tells userspace what key it uses for this.
    
    This can cause the test to fail with messages like:
    
            protection_keys_64.2: pkey-helpers.h:132: _read_pkey_reg: Assertion `pkey_reg == shadow_pkey_reg' failed.
    
    because the shadow was not updated with the new kernel-set value.
    
    Forcibly update the shadow value immediately after an mprotect().

    selftests/vm/pkeys: handle negative sys_pkey_alloc() return code
    
    [ Upstream commit bf68294a2ec39ed7fec6a5b45d52034e6983157a ]
    
    The alloc_pkey() sefltest function wraps the sys_pkey_alloc() system call.
    On success, it updates its "shadow" register value because
    sys_pkey_alloc() updates the real register.
    
    But, the success check is wrong.  pkey_alloc() considers any non-zero
    return code to indicate success where the pkey register will be modified.
    This fails to take negative return codes into account.
    
    Consider only a positive return value as a successful call.

    selftests/vm/pkeys: fix alloc_random_pkey() to make it really, really random
    
    [ Upstream commit f36ef407628835a7d7fb3d235b1f1aac7022d9a3 ]
    
    Patch series "selftests/vm/pkeys: Bug fixes and a new test".
    
    There has been a lot of activity on the x86 front around the XSAVE
    architecture which is used to context-switch processor state (among other
    things).  In addition, AMD has recently joined the protection keys club by
    adding processor support for PKU.
    
    The AMD implementation helped uncover a kernel bug around the PKRU "init
    state", which actually applied to Intel's implementation but was just
    harder to hit.  This series adds a test which is expected to help find
    this class of bug both on AMD and Intel.  All the work around pkeys on x86
    also uncovered a few bugs in the selftest.
    
    This patch (of 4):
    
    The "random" pkey allocation code currently does the good old:
    
            srand((unsigned int)time(NULL));
    
    *But*, it unfortunately does this on every random pkey allocation.
    
    There may be thousands of these a second.  time() has a one second
    resolution.  So, each time alloc_random_pkey() is called, the PRNG is
    *RESET* to time().  This is nasty.  Normally, if you do:
    
            srand(<ANYTHING>);
            foo = rand();
            bar = rand();
    
    You'll be quite guaranteed that 'foo' and 'bar' are different.  But, if
    you do:
    
            srand(1);
            foo = rand();
            srand(1);
            bar = rand();
    
    You are quite guaranteed that 'foo' and 'bar' are the *SAME*.  The recent
    "fix" effectively forced the test case to use the same "random" pkey for
    the whole test, unless the test run crossed a second boundary.
    
    Only run srand() once at program startup.
    
    This explains some very odd and persistent test failures I've been seeing.

    lib/math/rational.c: fix divide by zero
    
    [ Upstream commit 65a0d3c14685663ba111038a35db70f559e39336 ]
    
    If the input is out of the range of the allowed values, either larger than
    the largest value or closer to zero than the smallest non-zero allowed
    value, then a division by zero would occur.
    
    In the case of input too large, the division by zero will occur on the
    first iteration.  The best result (largest allowed value) will be found by
    always choosing the semi-convergent and excluding the denominator based
    limit when finding it.
    
    In the case of the input too small, the division by zero will occur on the
    second iteration.  The numerator based semi-convergent should not be
    calculated to avoid the division by zero.  But the semi-convergent vs
    previous convergent test is still needed, which effectively chooses
    between 0 (the previous convergent) vs the smallest allowed fraction (best
    semi-convergent) as the result.

    is true.  Because if the system is idle, KFENCE may wait, and by being run
    on the unbound work queue, we permit the scheduler to make better

    mm: migrate: fix missing update page_private to hugetlb_page_subpool
    
    [ Upstream commit 6acfb5ba150cf75005ce85e0e25d79ef2fec287c ]
    
    Since commit d6995da31122 ("hugetlb: use page.private for hugetlb specific
    page flags") converts page.private for hugetlb specific page flags.  We
    should use hugetlb_page_subpool() to get the subpool pointer instead of
    page_private().
    
    This 'could' prevent the migration of hugetlb pages.  page_private(hpage)
    is now used for hugetlb page specific flags.  At migration time, the only
    flag which could be set is HPageVmemmapOptimized.  This flag will only be
    set if the new vmemmap reduction feature is enabled.  In addition,
    !page_mapping() implies an anonymous mapping.  So, this will prevent
    migration of hugetb pages in anonymous mappings if the vmemmap reduction
    feature is enabled.
    
    In addition, that if statement checked for the rare race condition of a
    page being migrated while in the process of being freed.  Since that check
    is now wrong, we could leak hugetlb subpool usage counts.
    
    The commit forgot to update it in the page migration routine.  So fix it.

    hugetlb: remove prep_compound_huge_page cleanup
    
    [ Upstream commit 48b8d744ea841b8adf8d07bfe7a2d55f22e4d179 ]
    
    Patch series "Fix prep_compound_gigantic_page ref count adjustment".
    
    These patches address the possible race between
    prep_compound_gigantic_page and __page_cache_add_speculative as described
    by Jann Horn in [1].
    
    The first patch simply removes the unnecessary/obsolete helper routine
    prep_compound_huge_page to make the actual fix a little simpler.
    
    The second patch is the actual fix and has a detailed explanation in the
    commit message.
    
    This potential issue has existed for almost 10 years and I am unaware of
    anyone actually hitting the race.  I did not cc stable, but would be happy
    to squash the patches and send to stable if anyone thinks that is a good
    idea.
    
    [1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/CAG48ez23q0Jy9cuVnwAe7t_fdhMk2S7N5Hdi-GLcCeq5bsfLxw@mail.gmail.com/
    
    This patch (of 2):
    
    I could not think of a reliable way to recreate the issue for testing.
    Rather, I 'simulated errors' to exercise all the error paths.
    
    The routine prep_compound_huge_page is a simple wrapper to call either
    prep_compound_gigantic_page or prep_compound_page.  However, it is only
    called from gather_bootmem_prealloc which only processes gigantic pages.
    Eliminate the routine and call prep_compound_gigantic_page directly.

    Since commit 99cb0dbd47a1 ("mm,thp: add read-only THP support for
    (non-shmem) FS"), read-only THP file mapping is supported.  But it forgot
    to add checking for it in transparent_hugepage_enabled().  To fix it, we
    add checking for read-only THP file mapping and also introduce helper
    transhuge_vma_enabled() to check whether thp is enabled for specified vma
    to reduce duplicated code.  We rename transparent_hugepage_enabled to
    transparent_hugepage_active to make the code easier to follow as suggested
    by David Hildenbrand.

    mm/huge_memory.c: remove dedicated macro HPAGE_CACHE_INDEX_MASK
    
    [ Upstream commit b2bd53f18bb7f7cfc91b3bb527d7809376700a8e ]
    
    Patch series "Cleanup and fixup for huge_memory:, v3.
    
    This series contains cleanups to remove dedicated macro and remove
    unnecessary tlb_remove_page_size() for huge zero pmd.  Also this adds
    missing read-only THP checking for transparent_hugepage_enabled() and
    avoids discarding hugepage if other processes are mapping it.  More
    details can be found in the respective changelogs.
    
    Thi patch (of 5):
    
    Rewrite the pgoff checking logic to remove macro HPAGE_CACHE_INDEX_MASK
    which is only used here to simplify the code.

    vfio/pci: Handle concurrent vma faults
    
    [ Upstream commit 6a45ece4c9af473555f01f0f8b97eba56e3c7d0d ]
    
    io_remap_pfn_range() will trigger a BUG_ON if it encounters a
    populated pte within the mapping range.  This can occur because we map
    the entire vma on fault and multiple faults can be blocked behind the
    vma_lock.  This leads to traces like the one reported below.
    
    We can use our vma_list to test whether a given vma is mapped to avoid
    this issue.

    powerpc/64s: fix hash page fault interrupt handler
    
    [ Upstream commit 5567b1ee29b7a83e8c01d99d34b5bbd306ce0bcf ]
    
    The early bad fault or key fault test in do_hash_fault() ends up calling
    into ___do_page_fault without having gone through an interrupt handler
    wrapper (except the initial _RAW one). This can end up calling local irq
    functions while the interrupt has not been reconciled, which will likely
    cause crashes and it trips up on a later patch that adds more assertions.
    
    pkey_exec_prot from selftests causes this path to be executed.
    
    There is no real reason to run the in_nmi() test should be performed
    before the key fault check. In fact if a perf interrupt in the hash
    fault code did a stack walk that was made to take a key fault somehow
    then running ___do_page_fault could possibly cause another hash fault
    causing problems. Move the in_nmi() test first, and then do everything
    else inside the regular interrupt handler function.

    powerpc: Fix is_kvm_guest() / kvm_para_available()
    
    [ Upstream commit 95839225639ba7c3d8d7231b542728dcf222bf2d ]
    
    Commit a21d1becaa3f ("powerpc: Reintroduce is_kvm_guest() as a fast-path
    check") added is_kvm_guest() and changed kvm_para_available() to use it.
    
    is_kvm_guest() checks a static key, kvm_guest, and that static key is
    set in check_kvm_guest().
    
    The problem is check_kvm_guest() is only called on pseries, and even
    then only in some configurations. That means is_kvm_guest() always
    returns false on all non-pseries and some pseries depending on
    configuration. That's a bug.
    
    For PR KVM guests this is noticable because they no longer do live
    patching of themselves, which can be detected by the omission of a
    message in dmesg such as:
    
      KVM: Live patching for a fast VM worked
    
    To fix it make check_kvm_guest() an initcall, to ensure it's always
    called at boot. It needs to be core so that it runs before
    kvm_guest_init() which is postcore. To be an initcall it needs to return
    int, where 0 means success, so update that.
    
    We still call it manually in pSeries_smp_probe(), because that runs
    before init calls are run.

    powerpc/papr_scm: Make 'perf_stats' invisible if perf-stats unavailable
    
    [ Upstream commit ed78f56e1271f108e8af61baeba383dcd77adbec ]
    
    In case performance stats for an nvdimm are not available, reading the
    'perf_stats' sysfs file returns an -ENOENT error. A better approach is
    to make the 'perf_stats' file entirely invisible to indicate that
    performance stats for an nvdimm are unavailable.
    
    So this patch updates 'papr_nd_attribute_group' to add a 'is_visible'
    callback implemented as newly introduced 'papr_nd_attribute_visible()'
    that returns an appropriate mode in case performance stats aren't
    supported in a given nvdimm.
    
    Also the initialization of 'papr_scm_priv.stat_buffer_len' is moved
    from papr_scm_nvdimm_init() to papr_scm_probe() so that it value is
    available when 'papr_nd_attribute_visible()' is called during nvdimm
    initialization.
    
    Even though 'perf_stats' attribute is available since v5.9, there are
    no known user-space tools/scripts that are dependent on presence of its
    sysfs file. Hence I dont expect any user-space breakage with this
    patch.

    powerpc/64s: Fix copy-paste data exposure into newly created tasks
    
    [ Upstream commit f35d2f249ef05b9671e7898f09ad89aa78f99122 ]
    
    copy-paste contains implicit "copy buffer" state that can contain
    arbitrary user data (if the user process executes a copy instruction).
    This could be snooped by another process if a context switch hits while
    the state is live. So cp_abort is executed on context switch to clear
    out possible sensitive data and prevent the leak.
    
    cp_abort is done after the low level _switch(), which means it is never
    reached by newly created tasks, so they could snoop on this buffer
    between their first and second context switch.
    
    Fix this by doing the cp_abort before calling _switch. Add some
    comments which should make the issue harder to miss.

    printk_safe_flush_on_panic() has special lock breaking code for the case

    serial: 8250: 8250_omap: Fix possible interrupt storm on K3 SoCs
    
    [ Upstream commit b67e830d38fa9335d927fe67e812e3ed81b4689c ]
    
    On K3 family of SoCs (which includes AM654 SoC), it is observed that RX
    TIMEOUT is signalled after RX FIFO has been drained, in which case a
    dummy read of RX FIFO is required to clear RX TIMEOUT condition.
    Otherwise, this would lead to an interrupt storm.
    
    Fix this by introducing UART_RX_TIMEOUT_QUIRK flag and doing a dummy
    read in IRQ handler when RX TIMEOUT is reported with no data in RX FIFO.

    selftests/sgx: remove checks for file execute permissions
    
    [ Upstream commit 4896df9d53ae5521f3ce83751e828ad70bc65c80 ]
    
    The SGX selftests can fail for a bunch of non-obvious reasons
    like 'noexec' permissions on /dev (which is the default *EVERYWHERE*
    it seems).
    
    A new test mistakenly also looked for +x permission on the
    /dev/sgx_enclave.  File execute permissions really only apply to
    the ability of execve() to work on a file, *NOT* on the ability
    for an application to map the file with PROT_EXEC.  SGX needs to
    mmap(PROT_EXEC), but doesn't need to execve() the device file.
    
    Remove the check.

    [ Upstream commit a7a0a2feb957e446b2bcf732f245ba04fc8b6314 ]
    
    When system enter suspend, the machine driver suspend callback
    function will be called, then the cpu driver trigger callback
    (SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_SUSPEND) be called, it would disable the
    interrupt.
    
    But the machine driver suspend and cpu dai driver suspend order
    maybe changed, the cpu dai driver's suspend callback is called before
    machine driver's suppend callback, then the interrupt is not cleared
    successfully in trigger callback.
    
    So need to clear interrupts in cpu dai driver's suspend callback
    to avoid such issue.

    soundwire: stream: Fix test for DP prepare complete
    
    [ Upstream commit 3d3e88e336338834086278236d42039f3cde50e1 ]
    
    In sdw_prep_deprep_slave_ports(), after the wait_for_completion()
    the DP prepare status register is read. If this indicates that the
    port is now prepared, the code should continue with the port setup.
    It is irrelevant whether the wait_for_completion() timed out if the
    port is now ready.
    
    The previous implementation would always fail if the
    wait_for_completion() timed out, even if the port was reporting
    successful prepare.
    
    This patch also fixes a minor bug where the return from sdw_read()
    was not checked for error - any error code with LSBits clear could
    be misinterpreted as a successful port prepare.

    of: Fix truncation of memory sizes on 32-bit platforms
    
    [ Upstream commit 2892d8a00d23d511a0591ac4b2ff3f050ae1f004 ]
    
    Variable "size" has type "phys_addr_t", which can be either 32-bit or
    64-bit on 32-bit systems, while "unsigned long" is always 32-bit on
    32-bit systems.  Hence the cast in
    
        (unsigned long)size / SZ_1M
    
    may truncate a 64-bit size to 32-bit, as casts have a higher operator
    precedence than divisions.
    
    Fix this by inverting the order of the cast and division, which should
    be safe for memory blocks smaller than 4 PiB.  Note that the division is
    actually a shift, as SZ_1M is a power-of-two constant, hence there is no
    need to use div_u64().
    
    While at it, use "%lu" to format "unsigned long".

    serial: 8250: Actually allow UPF_MAGIC_MULTIPLIER baud rates
    
    [ Upstream commit 78bcae8616ac277d6cb7f38e211493948ed73e30 ]
    
    Support for magic baud rate divisors of 32770 and 32769 used with SMSC
    Super I/O chips for extra baud rates of 230400 and 460800 respectively
    where base rate is 115200[1] has been added around Linux 2.5.64, which
    predates our repo history, but the origin could be identified as commit
    2a717aad772f ("Merge with Linux 2.5.64.") with the old MIPS/Linux repo
    also at: <git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ralf/linux.git>.
    
    Code that is now in `serial8250_do_get_divisor' was added back then to
    `serial8250_get_divisor', but that code would only ever trigger if one
    of the higher baud rates was actually requested, and that cannot ever
    happen, because the earlier call to `serial8250_get_baud_rate' never
    returns them.  This is because it calls `uart_get_baud_rate' with the
    maximum requested being the base rate, that is clk/16 or 115200 for SMSC
    chips at their nominal clock rate.
    
    Fix it then and allow UPF_MAGIC_MULTIPLIER baud rates to be selected, by
    requesting the maximum baud rate of clk/4 rather than clk/16 if the flag
    has been set.  Also correct the minimum baud rate, observing that these
    ports only support actual (non-magic) divisors of up to 32767 only.

    [ Upstream commit 6f8d39a8ef55efde414b6e574384acbce70c3119 ]
    
    Some devices need an extra delay after losing VBUS, otherwise VBUS may
    be detected as active at suspend time, preventing the PHY's suspension
    by the VBUS detection sensor. This problem was found on Asus Transformer
    TF700T (Tegra30) tablet device, where the USB PHY wakes up immediately
    from suspend because VBUS sensor continues to detect VBUS as active after
    disconnection. We need to poll the PHY's VBUS wakeup status until it's
    deasserted before suspending PHY in order to fix this minor trouble.

    [ Upstream commit 5b4f167ef3555ec4c334a8dc89c1b44bb2c6bff5 ]
    
    Driver code call 'devm_of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources'
    to get resources and properly fill 'bridge->windows' and
    'bridge->dma_ranges'. After parsing the ranges and store
    as resources, at the end it makes a call to pci function
    'pci_add_resource_offset' to set the offset for the
    memory resource. To calculate offset, resource start address
    subtracts pci address of the range. MT7621 does not need
    any offset for the memory resource. Moreover, setting an
    offset got into 'WARN_ON' calls from pci devices driver code.
    Until now memory range pci_addr was being '0x00000000' and
    res->start is '0x60000000' but becase pci controller driver
    was manually setting resources and adding them using pci function
    'pci_add_resource' where a zero is passed as offset, things
    was properly working. Since PCI_IOBASE is defined now for
    ralink we don't set nothing manually anymore so we have to
    properly fix PCI address for this range to make things work
    and the new pci address must be set to '0x60000000'. Doing
    in this way the subtract result obtain zero as offset
    and pci device driver code properly works.

    staging: rtl8712: fix memory leak in rtl871x_load_fw_cb
    
    [ Upstream commit e02a3b945816a77702a2769a70ef5f9b06e49d54 ]
    
    There is a leak in rtl8712 driver.
    The problem was in non-freed adapter data if
    firmware load failed.
    
    This leak can be reproduced with this code:
    https://syzkaller.appspot.com/text?tag=ReproC&x=16612f02d00000,
    Autoload must fail (to not hit memory leak reported by syzkaller)
    
    There are 2 possible ways how rtl871x_load_fw_cb() and
    r871xu_dev_remove() can be called (in case of fw load error).
    
    1st case:
            r871xu_dev_remove() then rtl871x_load_fw_cb()
    
            In this case r871xu_dev_remove() will wait for
            completion and then will jump to the end, because
            rtl871x_load_fw_cb() set intfdata to NULL:
    
            if (pnetdev) {
                    struct _adapter *padapter = netdev_priv(pnetdev);
    
                    /* never exit with a firmware callback pending */
                    wait_for_completion(&padapter->rtl8712_fw_ready);
                    pnetdev = usb_get_intfdata(pusb_intf);
                    usb_set_intfdata(pusb_intf, NULL);
                    if (!pnetdev)
                            goto firmware_load_fail;
    
                    ... clean up code here ...
            }
    
    2nd case:
            rtl871x_load_fw_cb() then r871xu_dev_remove()
    
            In this case pnetdev (from code snippet above) will
            be zero (because rtl871x_load_fw_cb() set it to NULL)
            And clean up code won't be executed again.
    
    So, in all cases we need to free adapted data in rtl871x_load_fw_cb(),
    because disconnect function cannot take care of it. And there won't be
    any race conditions, because complete() call happens after setting
    intfdata to NULL.
    
    In previous patch I moved out free_netdev() from r8712_free_drv_sw()
    and that's why now it's possible to free adapter data and then call
    complete.

    Previous error handling path was unique for all
    possible errors and there was unnecessary branching.
    Also, one step for freeing drv_sw was missing. All
    these problems was fixed by restructuring error
    handling path.
    
    Also, moved out free_netdev() from r8712_free_drv_sw() for
    correct error handling.

    kunit: Fix result propagation for parameterised tests
    
    [ Upstream commit 384426bd101cb3cd580b18de19d4891ec5ca5bf9 ]
    
    When one parameter of a parameterised test failed, its failure would be
    propagated to the overall test, but not to the suite result (unless it
    was the last parameter).
    
    This is because test_case->success was being reset to the test->success
    result after each parameter was used, so a failing test's result would
    be overwritten by a non-failing result. The overall test result was
    handled in a third variable, test_result, but this was discarded after
    the status line was printed.
    
    Instead, just propagate the result after each parameter run.

    mtd: spinand: Fix double counting of ECC stats
    
    [ Upstream commit c93081b265735db2417f0964718516044d06b1a2 ]
    
    In the raw NAND world, ECC engines increment ecc_stats and the final
    caller is responsible for returning -EBADMSG if the verification
    failed.
    
    In the SPI-NAND world it was a bit different until now because there was
    only one possible ECC engine: the on-die one. Indeed, the
    spinand_mtd_read() call was incrementing the ecc_stats counters
    depending on the outcome of spinand_check_ecc_status() directly.
    
    So now let's split the logic like this:
    - spinand_check_ecc_status() is specific to the SPI-NAND on-die engine
      and is kept very simple: it just returns the ECC status (bonus point:
      the content of this helper can be overloaded).
    - spinand_ondie_ecc_finish_io_req() is the caller of
      spinand_check_ecc_status() and will increment the counters and
      eventually return -EBADMSG.
    - spinand_mtd_read() is not tied to the on-die ECC implementation and
      should be able to handle results coming from other ECC engines: it has
      the responsibility of returning the maximum number of bitflips which
      happened during the entire operation as this is the only helper that
      is aware that several pages may be read in a row.

    mtd: spi-nor: otp: return -EROFS if region is read-only
    
    [ Upstream commit 388161ca45c911f566b71716bce5ff0119fb5522 ]
    
    SPI NOR flashes will just ignore program commands if the OTP region is
    locked. Thus, a user might not notice that the intended write didn't end
    up in the flash. Return -EROFS to the user in this case. From what I can
    tell, chips/cfi_cmdset_0001.c also return this error code.
    
    One could optimize spi_nor_mtd_otp_range_is_locked() to read the status
    register only once and not for every OTP region, but for that we would
    need some more invasive changes. Given that this is
    one-time-programmable memory and the normal access mode is reading, we
    just live with the small overhead.
    
    By moving the code around a bit, we can just check the length before
    calling spi_nor_mtd_otp_range_is_locked() and avoid an underflow there
    if a len is 0. This way we don't need to take the lock either. We also
    skip the "*retlen = 0" assignment, mtdcore already takes care of that
    for us.

    usb: dwc2: Don't reset the core after setting turnaround time
    
    [ Upstream commit aafe93516b8567ab5864e1f4cd3eeabc54fb0e5a ]
    
    Every time the hub signals a reset while we (device) are hsotg->connected,
    dwc2_hsotg_core_init_disconnected() is called, which in turn calls
    dwc2_hs_phy_init().
    
    GUSBCFG.USBTrdTim is cleared upon Core Soft Reset, so if
    hsotg->params.phy_utmi_width is 8-bit, the value of GUSBCFG.USBTrdTim (the
    default one: 0x5, corresponding to 16-bit) is always different from
    hsotg->params.phy_utmi_width, thus dwc2_core_reset() is called every
    time (usbcfg != usbcfg_old), which causes 2 issues:
    
    1) The call to dwc2_core_reset() does another reset 300us after the initial
    Chirp K of the first reset (which should last at least Tuch = 1ms), and
    messes up the High-speed Detection Handshake: both hub and device drive
    current into the D+ and D- lines at the same time.
    
    2) GUSBCFG.USBTrdTim is cleared by the second reset, so its value is always
    the default one (0x5).
    
    Setting GUSBCFG.USBTrdTim after the potential call to dwc2_core_reset()
    fixes both issues.  It is now set even when select_phy is false because the
    cost of the Core Soft Reset is removed.

    usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix setting of device and driver data cross-references
    
    [ Upstream commit ecfbd7b9054bddb12cea07fda41bb3a79a7b0149 ]
    
    FunctionFS device structure 'struct ffs_dev' and driver data structure
    'struct ffs_data' are bound to each other with cross-reference pointers
    'ffs_data->private_data' and 'ffs_dev->ffs_data'. While the first one
    is supposed to be valid through the whole life of 'struct ffs_data'
    (and while 'struct ffs_dev' exists non-freed), the second one is cleared
    in 'ffs_closed()' (called from 'ffs_data_reset()' or the last
    'ffs_data_put()'). This can be called several times, alternating in
    different order with 'ffs_free_inst()', that, if possible, clears
    the other cross-reference.
    
    As a result, different cases of these calls order may leave stale
    cross-reference pointers, used when the pointed structure is already
    freed. Even if it occasionally doesn't cause kernel crash, this error
    is reported by KASAN-enabled kernel configuration.
    
    For example, the case [last 'ffs_data_put()' - 'ffs_free_inst()'] was
    fixed by commit cdafb6d8b8da ("usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix use-after-free in
    ffs_free_inst").
    
    The other case ['ffs_data_reset()' - 'ffs_free_inst()' - 'ffs_data_put()']
    now causes KASAN reported error [1], when 'ffs_data_reset()' clears
    'ffs_dev->ffs_data', then 'ffs_free_inst()' frees the 'struct ffs_dev',
    but can't clear 'ffs_data->private_data', which is then accessed
    in 'ffs_closed()' called from 'ffs_data_put()'. This happens since
    'ffs_dev->ffs_data' reference is cleared too early.
    
    Moreover, one more use case, when 'ffs_free_inst()' is called immediately
    after mounting FunctionFS device (that is before the descriptors are
    written and 'ffs_ready()' is called), and then 'ffs_data_reset()'
    or 'ffs_data_put()' is called from accessing "ep0" file or unmounting
    the device. This causes KASAN error report like [2], since
    'ffs_dev->ffs_data' is not yet set when 'ffs_free_inst()' can't properly
    clear 'ffs_data->private_data', that is later accessed to freed structure.
    
    Fix these (and may be other) cases of stale pointers access by moving
    setting and clearing of the mentioned cross-references to the single
    places, setting both of them when 'struct ffs_data' is created and
    bound to 'struct ffs_dev', and clearing both of them when one of the
    structures is destroyed. It seems convenient to make this pointer
    initialization and structures binding in 'ffs_acquire_dev()' and
    make pointers clearing in 'ffs_release_dev()'. This required some
    changes in these functions parameters and return types.
    
    Also, 'ffs_release_dev()' calling requires some cleanup, fixing minor
    issues, like (1) 'ffs_release_dev()' is not called if 'ffs_free_inst()'
    is called without unmounting the device, and "release_dev" callback
    is not called at all, or (2) "release_dev" callback is called before
    "ffs_closed" callback on unmounting, which seems to be not correctly
    nested with "acquire_dev" and "ffs_ready" callbacks.
    Make this cleanup togther with other mentioned 'ffs_release_dev()' changes.

    If an error occurs after a successful 'of_iomap()' call, it must be undone
    by a corresponding 'iounmap()' call, as already done in the remove
    function.
    
    While at it, remove the useless initialization of 'ret' at the beginning of
    the function.

    ASoC: rt715-sdca: fix clock stop prepare timeout issue
    
    [ Upstream commit e343d34a9c912fc5c321e2a9fbc02e9dc9534ade ]
    
    Fix clock stop prepare timeout issue (#2853).
    The trigger of internal circuit which belong to
    “SDCA preset stuffs” was not set correctly in previous driver,
    which could block clock_stop_preparation state.
    Add the correct register setting to fix it.

    ASoC: rt715-sdw: use first_hw_init flag on resume
    
    [ Upstream commit dbc07517ab173688ef11234d1099bc1e24e4f14b ]
    
    The intent of the status check on resume was to verify if a SoundWire
    peripheral reported ATTACHED before waiting for the initialization to
    complete. This is required to avoid timeouts that will happen with
    'ghost' devices that are exposed in the platform firmware but are not
    populated in hardware.
    
    Unfortunately we used 'hw_init' instead of 'first_hw_init'. Due to
    another error, the resume operation never timed out, but the volume
    settings were not properly restored.

    s390: enable HAVE_IOREMAP_PROT
    
    [ Upstream commit d460bb6c6417588dd8b0907d34f69b237918812a ]
    
    In commit b02002cc4c0f ("s390/pci: Implement ioremap_wc/prot() with
    MIO") we implemented both ioremap_wc() and ioremap_prot() however until
    now we had not set HAVE_IOREMAP_PROT in Kconfig, do so now.
    
    This also requires implementing pte_pgprot() as this is used in the
    generic_access_phys() code enabled by CONFIG_HAVE_IOREMAP_PROT. As with
    ioremap_wc() we need to take the MMIO Write Back bit index into account.
    
    Moreover since the pgprot value returned from pte_pgprot() is to be used
    for mappings into kernel address space we must make sure that it uses
    appropriate kernel page table protection bits. In particular a pgprot
    value originally coming from userspace could have the _PAGE_PROTECT
    bit set to enable fault based dirty bit accounting which would then make
    the mapping inaccessible when used in kernel address space.

    iommu/amd: Tidy up DMA ops init
    
    [ Upstream commit be227f8e99a663d097536e9f9bc935fb26bdbc41 ]
    
    Now that DMA ops are part of the core API via iommu-dma, fold the
    vestigial remains of the IOMMU_DMA_OPS init state into the IOMMU API
    phase, and clean up a few other leftovers. This should also close the
    race window wherein bus_set_iommu() effectively makes the DMA ops state
    visible before its nominal initialisation - it seems this was previously
    fairly benign, but since commit a250c23f15c2 ("iommu: remove
    DOMAIN_ATTR_DMA_USE_FLUSH_QUEUE") it can now lead to the strict flush
    queue policy inadvertently being picked for default domains allocated
    during that window, with a corresponding unexpected perfomance impact.

    iommu/amd: Fix extended features logging
    
    [ Upstream commit 4b21a503adf597773e4b37db05db0e9b16a81d53 ]
    
    print_iommu_info prints the EFR register and then the decoded list of
    features on a separate line:
    
    pci 0000:00:00.2: AMD-Vi: Extended features (0x206d73ef22254ade):
     PPR X2APIC NX GT IA GA PC GA_vAPIC
    
    The second line is emitted via 'pr_cont', which causes it to have a
    different ('warn') loglevel compared to the previous line ('info').
    
    Commit 9a295ff0ffc9 attempted to rectify this by removing the newline
    from the pci_info format string, but this doesn't work, as pci_info
    calls implicitly append a newline anyway.
    
    Printing the decoded features on the same line would make it quite long.
    Instead, change pci_info() to pr_info() to omit PCI bus location info,
    which is also shown in the preceding message. This results in:
    
    pci 0000:00:00.2: AMD-Vi: Found IOMMU cap 0x40

    Commit 1366a3db3dcf ("staging: unisys: visorbus: visorchipset_init clean

    error". But commit f1f537c2e7f5 ("staging: unisys: visorbus: Consolidate
    controlvm channel creation.") overwrites 'err' in the middle of the way.
    As a result, some error branches do not successfully return the initial
    value -ENODEV of 'err', but return 0.
    
    In addition, when kzalloc() fails, -ENOMEM should be returned instead of
    -ENODEV.

    We set the max_active iSCSI EH works to 1, so all work is going to execute

    iscsi_unblock_session running the unblock_work on CPU2 and the session and
    target/device state will end up out of sync with each other.
    
    This adds a flush of the block_work in iscsi_unblock_session.

    scsi: iscsi: Fix in-kernel conn failure handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 23d6fefbb3f6b1cc29794427588b470ed06ff64e ]
    
    Commit 0ab710458da1 ("scsi: iscsi: Perform connection failure entirely in
    kernel space") has the following regressions/bugs that this patch fixes:
    
    1. It can return cmds to upper layers like dm-multipath where that can
    retry them. After they are successful the fs/app can send new I/O to the
    same sectors, but we've left the cmds running in FW or in the net layer.
    We need to be calling ep_disconnect if userspace is not up.
    
    This patch only fixes the issue for offload drivers. iscsi_tcp will be
    fixed in separate commit because it doesn't have a ep_disconnect call.
    
    2. The drivers that implement ep_disconnect expect that it's called before
    conn_stop. Besides crashes, if the cleanup_task callout is called before
    ep_disconnect it might free up driver/card resources for session1 then they
    could be allocated for session2. But because the driver's ep_disconnect is
    not called it has not cleaned up the firmware so the card is still using
    the resources for the original cmd.
    
    3. The stop_conn_work_fn can run after userspace has done its recovery and
    we are happily using the session. We will then end up with various bugs
    depending on what is going on at the time.
    
    We may also run stop_conn_work_fn late after userspace has called stop_conn
    and ep_disconnect and is now going to call start/bind conn. If
    stop_conn_work_fn runs after bind but before start, we would leave the conn
    in a unbound but sort of started state where IO might be allowed even
    though the drivers have been set in a state where they no longer expect
    I/O.
    
    4. Returning -EAGAIN in iscsi_if_destroy_conn if we haven't yet run the in
    kernel stop_conn function is breaking userspace. We should have been doing
    this for the caller.

    scsi: iscsi: Force immediate failure during shutdown
    
    [ Upstream commit 06c203a5566beecebb1f8838d026de8a61c8df71 ]
    
    If the system is not up, we can just fail immediately since iscsid is not
    going to ever answer our netlink events. We are already setting the
    recovery_tmo to 0, but by passing stop_conn STOP_CONN_TERM we never will
    block the session and start the recovery timer, because for that flag
    userspace will do the unbind and destroy events which would remove the
    devices and wake up and kill the eh.
    
    Since the conn is dead and the system is going dowm this just has us use
    STOP_CONN_RECOVER with recovery_tmo=0 so we fail immediately. However, if
    the user has set the recovery_tmo=-1 we let the system hang like they
    requested since they might have used that setting for specific reasons
    (one known reason is for buggy cluster software).

    I/O but every driver except cxgbi and iscsi_tcp can still get I/O from
    __iscsi_conn_send_pdu() if we haven't called iscsi_conn_failure() before
    ep_disconnect. This could happen if we were terminating the session, and
    the logout timed out before it was even sent to libiscsi.
    
    Fix the issue by adding a helper which reverses the bind_conn call that
    allows new I/O to be queued. Drivers implementing ep_disconnect can use this
    to make sure new I/O is not queued to them when handling the disconnect.

    scsi: FlashPoint: Rename si_flags field
    
    [ Upstream commit 4d431153e751caa93f3b7e6f6313446974e92253 ]
    
    The BusLogic driver has build errors on ia64 due to a name collision (in
    the #included FlashPoint.c file). Rename the struct field in struct
    sccb_mgr_info from si_flags to si_mflags (manager flags) to mend the build.
    
    This is the first problem. There are 50+ others after this one:

    For some reason lost in history function vchiq_mmal_init used
    a static variable for storing the vchiq_instance.
    This value is retrieved from vchiq per instance, so worked fine
    until you try to call vchiq_mmal_init multiple times concurrently
    when things then go wrong. This seemed to happen quite frequently
    if using the cutdown firmware (no MMAL or VCSM services running)
    as the vchiq_connect then failed, and one or other vchiq_shutdown
    was working on an invalid handle.
    
    Remove the static so that each caller gets a unique vchiq_instance.

    [ Upstream commit b5437c7b682c9a505065b4ab4716cdc951dc3c7c ]
    
    The controller being always asserting one CS or the other, there is no
    need to actually select the right target before doing a page read/write.
    However, the anfc_select_target() helper actually also changes the
    timing configuration and clock in the case were two different NAND chips
    with different timing requirements would be used. In this situation, we
    must ensure proper configuration of the controller by calling it.
    
    As a consequence of this change, the anfc_select_target() helper is
    being moved earlier in the driver.

    perf scripting python: Fix tuple_set_u64()
    
    [ Upstream commit d04c1ff0b3ddd5c0fbbe640996c8eaad279ed1c5 ]
    
    tuple_set_u64() produces a signed value instead of an unsigned value.
    That works for database export but not other cases. Rename to
    tuple_set_d64() for database export and fix tuple_set_u64().
    
    Fixes: df919b400ad3f ("perf scripting python: Extend interface to export data in a database-friendly way")

    [ Upstream commit 8dea228b174ac9637b567e5ef54f4c40db4b3c41 ]
    
    The samples buffer is passed to iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp()
    which requires a buffer aligned to 8 bytes as it is assumed that
    the timestamp will be naturally aligned if present.

    [ Upstream commit 00a72db718fa198da3946286dcad222399ccd4fb ]
    
    On an IRQ handler we should not return normal error codes as 'irqreturn_t'
    is expected.
    
    This is done by jumping to the 'check_burst32' label where we return
    'IRQ_HANDLED'. Note that it is fine to do the burst32 check in this
    error path. If we have proper settings to apply burst32, we might just
    do the setup now so that the next sample already uses it.

    mwifiex: re-fix for unaligned accesses
    
    [ Upstream commit 8f4e3d48bb50765ab27ae5bebed2595b20de80a1 ]
    
    A patch from 2017 changed some accesses to DMA memory to use
    get_unaligned_le32() and similar interfaces, to avoid problems
    with doing unaligned accesson uncached memory.
    
    However, the change in the mwifiex_pcie_alloc_sleep_cookie_buf()
    function ended up changing the size of the access instead,
    as it operates on a pointer to u8.
    
    Change this function back to actually access the entire 32 bits.
    Note that the pointer is aligned by definition because it came
    from dma_alloc_coherent().

    rcu: Invoke rcu_spawn_core_kthreads() from rcu_spawn_gp_kthread()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8e4b1d2bc198e34b48fc7cc3a3c5a2fcb269e271 ]
    
    Currently, rcu_spawn_core_kthreads() is invoked via an early_initcall(),
    which works, except that rcu_spawn_gp_kthread() is also invoked via an
    early_initcall() and rcu_spawn_core_kthreads() relies on adjustments to
    kthread_prio that are carried out by rcu_spawn_gp_kthread().  There is
    no guaranttee of ordering among early_initcall() handlers, and thus no
    guarantee that kthread_prio will be properly checked and range-limited
    at the time that rcu_spawn_core_kthreads() needs it.
    
    In most cases, this bug is harmless.  After all, the only reason that
    rcu_spawn_gp_kthread() adjusts the value of kthread_prio is if the user
    specified a nonsensical value for this boot parameter, which experience
    indicates is rare.
    
    Nevertheless, a bug is a bug.  This commit therefore causes the
    rcu_spawn_core_kthreads() function to be invoked directly from
    rcu_spawn_gp_kthread() after any needed adjustments to kthread_prio have
    been carried out.

    ASoC: rt5682: Disable irq on shutdown
    
    [ Upstream commit 47bcb1c7108363418cd578283333d72e310dfeaa ]
    
    We cancel the work queues, and reset the device on shutdown, but the irq
    isn't disabled so the work queues could be queued again. Let's disable
    the irq during shutdown so that we don't have to worry about this device
    trying to do anything anymore. This fixes a problem seen where the i2c
    bus is shutdown at reboot but this device irq still comes in and tries
    to make another i2c transaction when the bus doesn't work.

    staging: fbtft: Rectify GPIO handling
    
    [ Upstream commit ec03c2104365ead0a33627c05e685093eed3eaef ]
    
    The infamous commit c440eee1a7a1 ("Staging: staging: fbtft: Switch to
    the GPIO descriptor interface") broke GPIO handling completely.
    It has already four commits to rectify and it seems not enough.
    In order to fix the mess here we:
    
      1) Set default to "inactive" for all requested pins
    
      2) Fix CS#, RD#, and WR# pins polarity since it's active low
         and GPIO descriptor interface takes it into consideration
         from the Device Tree or ACPI
    
      3) Consolidate chip activation (CS# assertion) under default
         ->reset() callback
    
    To summarize the expectations about polarity for GPIOs:
    
       RD#                  Low
       WR#                  Low
       CS#                  Low
       RESET#               Low
       DC or RS             High
       RW                   High
       Data 0 .. 15         High
    
    See also Adafruit learning course [1] for the example of the schematics.
    
    While at it, drop unneeded NULL checks, since GPIO API is tolerant to that.

    [ Upstream commit 116138c3bd34f92e550431d495db515f5ea19f13 ]
    
    Commit 6e2baa44c6d1 ("staging: rtl8712: remove enum WIFI_FRAME_SUBTYPE")
    was wrong because:
            WIFI_DATA_NULL != IEEE80211_STYPE_NULLFUNC
            WIFI_DATA_CFACK != IEEE80211_STYPE_DATA_CFACK
            WIFI_DATA_CFPOLL != IEEE80211_STYPE_DATA_CFPOLL
            WIFI_DATA_CFACKPOLL != IEEE80211_STYPE_DATA_CFACKPOLL
    
    the WIFI_DATA_xxx definitions include WIFI_DATA_TYPE, which is 'BIT(3)'.
    Restore the previous behavior by adding the missing
    'IEEE80211_FTYPE_DATA |' (0x0008, that is to say BIT(3)) when these values
    are used.
    
    Hopefully, the wrong commit was small enough and hand review is possible.

    net: tipc: fix FB_MTU eat two pages
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c6de0c943dbb42831bf7502eb5c007f71e752d2 ]
    
    FB_MTU is used in 'tipc_msg_build()' to alloc smaller skb when memory
    allocation fails, which can avoid unnecessary sending failures.
    
    The value of FB_MTU now is 3744, and the data size will be:
    
      (3744 + SKB_DATA_ALIGN(sizeof(struct skb_shared_info)) + \
        SKB_DATA_ALIGN(BUF_HEADROOM + BUF_TAILROOM + 3))
    
    which is larger than one page(4096), and two pages will be allocated.
    
    To avoid it, replace '3744' with a calculation:
    
      (PAGE_SIZE - SKB_DATA_ALIGN(BUF_OVERHEAD) - \
        SKB_DATA_ALIGN(sizeof(struct skb_shared_info)))
    
    What's more, alloc_skb_fclone() will call SKB_DATA_ALIGN for data size,
    and it's not necessary to make alignment for buf_size in
    tipc_buf_acquire(). So, just remove it.

    Commit 14972cbd34ff ("net: lwtunnel: Handle fragmentation") moved
    fragmentation logic away from lwtunnel by carry encap headroom and
    use it in output MTU calculation. But the forwarding part was not
    covered and created difference in MTU for output and forwarding and
    further to silent drops on ipv4 forwarding path. Fix it by taking
    into account lwtunnel encap headroom.
    
    The same commit also introduced difference in how to treat RTAX_MTU
    in IPv4 and IPv6 where latter explicitly removes lwtunnel encap
    headroom from route MTU. Make IPv4 version do the same.

    writeback: fix obtain a reference to a freeing memcg css
    
    [ Upstream commit 8b0ed8443ae6458786580d36b7d5f8125535c5d4 ]
    
    The caller of wb_get_create() should pin the memcg, because
    wb_get_create() relies on this guarantee. The rcu read lock
    only can guarantee that the memcg css returned by css_from_id()
    cannot be released, but the reference of the memcg can be zero.
    
      rcu_read_lock()
      memcg_css = css_from_id()
      wb_get_create(memcg_css)
          cgwb_create(memcg_css)
              // css_get can change the ref counter from 0 back to 1
              css_get(memcg_css)
      rcu_read_unlock()
    
    Fix it by holding a reference to the css before calling
    wb_get_create(). This is not a problem I encountered in the
    real world. Just the result of a code review.

    configuration, some of the register contents may contain unexpected
    values, such as zeros, which could cause divide by zero errors during

    The Si5341 datasheet warns that before accessing any other registers,

    to indicate the device is ready, or the process of the device loading its
    state from NVM can be corrupted. Wait for DEVICE_READY on startup before
    continuing initialization. This is done using a raw I2C register read
    prior to setting up regmap to avoid any potential unwanted automatic PAGE

    clk: actions: Fix AHPPREDIV-H-AHB clock chain on Owl S500 SoC
    
    [ Upstream commit fd90b5b9045274360b12cea0f2ce50f3bcfb25cc ]
    
    There are a few issues with the setup of the Actions Semi Owl S500 SoC's
    clock chain involving AHPPREDIV, H and AHB clocks:
    
    * AHBPREDIV clock is defined as a muxer only, although it also acts as
      a divider.
    * H clock is using a wrong divider register offset
    * AHB is defined as a multi-rate factor clock, but it is actually just
      a fixed pass clock.
    
    Let's provide the following fixes:
    
    * Change AHBPREDIV clock to an ungated OWL_COMP_DIV definition.
    * Use the correct register shift value in the OWL_DIVIDER definition
      for H clock
    * Drop the unneeded 'ahb_factor_table[]' and change AHB clock to an
      ungated OWL_COMP_FIXED_FACTOR definition.

    clk: actions: Fix bisp_factor_table based clocks on Owl S500 SoC
    
    [ Upstream commit a8f1f03caa51aa7a69c671aa87c475034db7d368 ]
    
    The following clocks of the Actions Semi Owl S500 SoC have been defined
    to use a shared clock factor table 'bisp_factor_table[]': DE[1-2], VCE,
    VDE, BISP, SENSOR[0-1]
    
    There are several issues involved in this approach:
    
    * 'bisp_factor_table[]' describes the configuration of a regular 8-rates
      divider, so its usage is redundant. Additionally, judging by the BISP
      clock context, it is incomplete since it maps only 8 out of 12
      possible entries.
    
    * The clocks mentioned above are not identical in terms of the available
      rates, therefore cannot rely on the same factor table. Specifically,
      BISP and SENSOR* are standard 12-rate dividers so their configuration
      should rely on a proper clock div table, while VCE and VDE require a
      factor table that is a actually a subset of the one needed for DE[1-2]
      clocks.
    
    Let's fix this by implementing the following:
    
    * Add new factor tables 'de_factor_table' and 'hde_factor_table' to
      properly handle DE[1-2], VCE and VDE clocks.
    
    * Add a common div table 'std12rate_div_table' for BISP and SENSOR[0-1]
      clocks converted to OWL_COMP_DIV.
    
    * Drop the now unused 'bisp_factor_table[]'.
    
    Additionally, drop the CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED flag for SENSOR[0-1] since
    there is no reason to always keep ON those clocks.

    clk: zynqmp: fix compile testing without ZYNQMP_FIRMWARE
    
    [ Upstream commit 6c9feabc2c6bd49abbd2130341e7cb91f42d3fa5 ]
    
    When the firmware code is disabled, the incomplete error handling
    in the clk driver causes compile-time warnings:
    
    drivers/clk/zynqmp/pll.c: In function 'zynqmp_pll_recalc_rate':
    drivers/clk/zynqmp/pll.c:147:29: error: 'fbdiv' is used uninitialized [-Werror=uninitialized]
      147 |         rate =  parent_rate * fbdiv;
          |                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~
    In function 'zynqmp_pll_get_mode',
        inlined from 'zynqmp_pll_recalc_rate' at drivers/clk/zynqmp/pll.c:148:6:
    drivers/clk/zynqmp/pll.c:61:27: error: 'ret_payload' is used uninitialized [-Werror=uninitialized]
       61 |         return ret_payload[1];
          |                ~~~~~~~~~~~^~~
    drivers/clk/zynqmp/pll.c: In function 'zynqmp_pll_recalc_rate':
    drivers/clk/zynqmp/pll.c:53:13: note: 'ret_payload' declared here
       53 |         u32 ret_payload[PAYLOAD_ARG_CNT];
          |             ^~~~~~~~~~~
    drivers/clk/zynqmp/clk-mux-zynqmp.c: In function 'zynqmp_clk_mux_get_parent':
    drivers/clk/zynqmp/clk-mux-zynqmp.c:57:16: error: 'val' is used uninitialized [-Werror=uninitialized]
       57 |         return val;
          |                ^~~
    
    As it was apparently intentional to support this for compile testing
    purposes, change the code to have just enough error handling for the
    compiler to not notice the remaining bugs.

    Revert "be2net: disable bh with spin_lock in be_process_mcc"
    
    [ Upstream commit d6765985a42a660f078896d5c5b27f97c580a490 ]
    
    Patch was based on wrong presumption that be_poll can be called only
    from bh context. It reintroducing old regression (also reverted) and
    causing deadlock when we use netconsole with benet in bonding.
    
    Old revert: commit 072a9c486004 ("netpoll: revert 6bdb7fe3104 and fix
    be_poll() instead")

    RDMA/cma: Fix incorrect Packet Lifetime calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit e84045eab69c625bc0b0bf24d8e05bc65da1eed1 ]
    
    An approximation for the PacketLifeTime is half the local ACK timeout.
    The encoding for both timers are logarithmic.
    
    If the local ACK timeout is set, but zero, it means the timer is
    disabled. In this case, we choose the CMA_IBOE_PACKET_LIFETIME value,
    since 50% of infinite makes no sense.
    
    Before this commit, the PacketLifeTime became 255 if local ACK
    timeout was zero (not running).
    
    Fixed by explicitly testing for timeout being zero.

    bpfilter: Specify the log level for the kmsg message
    
    [ Upstream commit a196fa78a26571359740f701cf30d774eb8a72cb ]
    
    Per the kmsg document [0], if we don't specify the log level with a
    prefix "<N>" in the message string, the default log level will be
    applied to the message. Since the default level could be warning(4),
    this would make the log utility such as journalctl treat the message,
    "Started bpfilter", as a warning. To avoid confusion, this commit
    adds the prefix "<5>" to make the message always a notice.

    net: dsa: sja1105: fix NULL pointer dereference in sja1105_reload_cbs()
    
    [ Upstream commit be7f62eebaff2f86c1467a2d33930a0a7a87675b ]
    
    priv->cbs is an array of priv->info->num_cbs_shapers elements of type
    struct sja1105_cbs_entry which only get allocated if CONFIG_NET_SCH_CBS
    is enabled.
    
    However, sja1105_reload_cbs() is called from sja1105_static_config_reload()
    which in turn is called for any of the items in sja1105_reset_reasons,
    therefore during the normal runtime of the driver and not just from a
    code path which can be triggered by the tc-cbs offload.
    
    The sja1105_reload_cbs() function does not contain a check whether the
    priv->cbs array is NULL or not, it just assumes it isn't and proceeds to
    iterate through the credit-based shaper elements. This leads to a NULL
    pointer dereference.
    
    The solution is to return success if the priv->cbs array has not been
    allocated, since sja1105_reload_cbs() has nothing to do.

    [ Upstream commit 624085a31c1ad6a80b1e53f686bf6ee92abbf6e8 ]
    
    First problem is that optlen is fetched without checking
    there is more than one byte to parse.
    
    Fix this by taking care of IPV6_TLV_PAD1 before
    fetching optlen (under appropriate sanity checks against len)
    
    Second problem is that IPV6_TLV_PADN checks of zero
    padding are performed before the check of remaining length.

    RDMA/cma: Protect RMW with qp_mutex
    
    [ Upstream commit ca0c448d2b9f43e3175835d536853854ef544e22 ]
    
    The struct rdma_id_private contains three bit-fields, tos_set,
    timeout_set, and min_rnr_timer_set. These are set by accessor functions
    without any synchronization. If two or all accessor functions are invoked
    in close proximity in time, there will be Read-Modify-Write from several
    contexts to the same variable, and the result will be intermittent.
    
    Fixed by protecting the bit-fields by the qp_mutex in the accessor
    functions.
    
    The consumer of timeout_set and min_rnr_timer_set is in
    rdma_init_qp_attr(), which is called with qp_mutex held for connected
    QPs. Explicit locking is added for the consumers of tos and tos_set.
    
    This commit depends on ("RDMA/cma: Remove unnecessary INIT->INIT
    transition"), since the call to rdma_init_qp_attr() from
    cma_init_conn_qp() does not hold the qp_mutex.

    ibmvnic: clean pending indirect buffs during reset
    
    [ Upstream commit 65d6470d139a6c1655fccb5cbacbeaba8e8ad2f8 ]
    
    We batch subordinate command response queue (scrq) descriptors that we
    need to send to the VIOS using an "indirect" buffer. If after we queue
    one or more scrqs in the indirect buffer encounter an error (say fail
    to allocate an skb), we leave the queued scrq descriptors in the
    indirect buffer until the next call to ibmvnic_xmit().
    
    On the next call to ibmvnic_xmit(), it is possible that the adapter is
    going through a reset and it is possible that the long term  buffers
    have been unmapped on the VIOS side. If we proceed to flush (send) the
    packets that are in the indirect buffer, we will end up using the old
    map ids and this can cause the VIOS to trigger an unnecessary FATAL
    error reset.
    
    Instead of flushing packets remaining on the indirect_buff, discard
    (clean) them instead.

    [ Upstream commit 0ec13aff058a82426c8d44b688c804cc4a5a0a3d ]
    
    This reverts commit 1c7d45e7b2c29080bf6c8cd0e213cc3cbb62a054.
    
    We tried to optimize the number of hcalls we send and skipped sending
    the REQUEST_MAP calls for some maps. However during resets, we need to
    resend all the maps to the VIOS since the VIOS does not remember the
    old values. In fact we may have failed over to a new VIOS which will
    not have any of the mappings.
    
    When we send packets with map ids the VIOS does not know about, it
    triggers a FATAL reset. While the client does recover from the FATAL
    error reset, we are seeing a large number of such resets. Handling
    FATAL resets is lot more unnecessary work than issuing a few more
    hcalls so revert the commit and resend the maps to the VIOS.

    bpf: Do not change gso_size during bpf_skb_change_proto()
    
    [ Upstream commit 364745fbe981a4370f50274475da4675661104df ]
    
    This is technically a backwards incompatible change in behaviour, but I'm
    going to argue that it is very unlikely to break things, and likely to fix
    *far* more then it breaks.
    
    In no particular order, various reasons follow:
    
    (a) I've long had a bug assigned to myself to debug a super rare kernel crash
    on Android Pixel phones which can (per stacktrace) be traced back to BPF clat
    IPv6 to IPv4 protocol conversion causing some sort of ugly failure much later
    on during transmit deep in the GSO engine, AFAICT precisely because of this
    change to gso_size, though I've never been able to manually reproduce it. I
    believe it may be related to the particular network offload support of attached
    USB ethernet dongle being used for tethering off of an IPv6-only cellular
    connection. The reason might be we end up with more segments than max permitted,
    or with a GSO packet with only one segment... (either way we break some
    assumption and hit a BUG_ON)
    
    (b) There is no check that the gso_size is > 20 when reducing it by 20, so we
    might end up with a negative (or underflowing) gso_size or a gso_size of 0.
    This can't possibly be good. Indeed this is probably somehow exploitable (or
    at least can result in a kernel crash) by delivering crafted packets and perhaps
    triggering an infinite loop or a divide by zero... As a reminder: gso_size (MSS)
    is related to MTU, but not directly derived from it: gso_size/MSS may be
    significantly smaller then one would get by deriving from local MTU. And on
    some NICs (which do loose MTU checking on receive, it may even potentially be
    larger, for example my work pc with 1500 MTU can receive 1520 byte frames [and
    sometimes does due to bugs in a vendor plat46 implementation]). Indeed even just
    going from 21 to 1 is potentially problematic because it increases the number
    of segments by a factor of 21 (think DoS, or some other crash due to too many
    segments).
    
    (c) It's always safe to not increase the gso_size, because it doesn't result in
    the max packet size increasing.  So the skb_increase_gso_size() call was always
    unnecessary for correctness (and outright undesirable, see later). As such the
    only part which is potentially dangerous (ie. could cause backwards compatibility
    issues) is the removal of the skb_decrease_gso_size() call.
    
    (d) If the packets are ultimately destined to the local device, then there is
    absolutely no benefit to playing around with gso_size. It only matters if the
    packets will egress the device. ie. we're either forwarding, or transmitting
    from the device.
    
    (e) This logic only triggers for packets which are GSO. It does not trigger for
    skbs which are not GSO. It will not convert a non-GSO MTU sized packet into a
    GSO packet (and you don't even know what the MTU is, so you can't even fix it).
    As such your transmit path must *already* be able to handle an MTU 20 bytes
    larger then your receive path (for IPv4 to IPv6 translation) - and indeed 28
    bytes larger due to IPv4 fragments. Thus removing the skb_decrease_gso_size()
    call doesn't actually increase the size of the packets your transmit side must
    be able to handle. ie. to handle non-GSO max-MTU packets, the IPv4/IPv6 device/
    route MTUs must already be set correctly. Since for example with an IPv4 egress
    MTU of 1500, IPv4 to IPv6 translation will already build 1520 byte IPv6 frames,
    so you need a 1520 byte device MTU. This means if your IPv6 device's egress
    MTU is 1280, your IPv4 route must be 1260 (and actually 1252, because of the
    need to handle fragments). This is to handle normal non-GSO packets. Thus the
    reduction is simply not needed for GSO packets, because when they're correctly
    built, they will already be the right size.
    
    (f) TSO/GSO should be able to exactly undo GRO: the number of packets (TCP
    segments) should not be modified, so that TCP's MSS counting works correctly
    (this matters for congestion control). If protocol conversion changes the
    gso_size, then the number of TCP segments may increase or decrease. Packet loss
    after protocol conversion can result in partial loss of MSS segments that the
    sender sent. How's the sending TCP stack going to react to receiving ACKs/SACKs
    in the middle of the segments it sent?
    
    (g) skb_{decrease,increase}_gso_size() are already no-ops for GSO_BY_FRAGS
    case (besides triggering WARN_ON_ONCE). This means you already cannot guarantee
    that gso_size (and thus resulting packet MTU) is changed. ie. you must assume
    it won't be changed.
    
    (h) changing gso_size is outright buggy for UDP GSO packets, where framing
    matters (I believe that's also the case for SCTP, but it's already excluded
    by [g]).  So the only remaining case is TCP, which also doesn't want it
    (see [f]).
    
    (i) see also the reasoning on the previous attempt at fixing this
    (commit fa7b83bf3b156c767f3e4a25bbf3817b08f3ff8e) which shows that the current
    behaviour causes TCP packet loss:
    
      In the forwarding path GRO -> BPF 6 to 4 -> GSO for TCP traffic, the
      coalesced packet payload can be > MSS, but < MSS + 20.
    
      bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4() will upgrade the MSS and it can be > the payload
      length. After then tcp_gso_segment checks for the payload length if it
      is <= MSS. The condition is causing the packet to be dropped.
    
      tcp_gso_segment():
        [...]
        mss = skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_size;
        if (unlikely(skb->len <= mss)) goto out;
        [...]
    
    Thus changing the gso_size is simply a very bad idea. Increasing is unnecessary
    and buggy, and decreasing can go negative.

    ipv6: exthdrs: do not blindly use init_net
    
    [ Upstream commit bcc3f2a829b9edbe3da5fb117ee5a63686d31834 ]
    
    I see no reason why max_dst_opts_cnt and max_hbh_opts_cnt
    are fetched from the initial net namespace.
    
    The other sysctls (max_dst_opts_len & max_hbh_opts_len)
    are in fact already using the current ns.
    
    Note: it is not clear why ipv6_destopt_rcv() use two ways to
    get to the netns :
    
     1) dev_net(dst->dev)
        Originally used to increment IPSTATS_MIB_INHDRERRORS
    
     2) dev_net(skb->dev)
         Tom used this variant in his patch.
    
    Maybe this calls to use ipv6_skb_net() instead ?

    [ Upstream commit b2ac9800cfe0f8da16abc4e74e003440361c112e ]
    
    The Broadcom UniMAC MDIO bus from mdio-bcm-unimac module comes too late.
    So, GENET cannot find the ethernet PHY on UniMAC MDIO bus. This leads
    GENET fail to attach the PHY as following log:
    
    bcmgenet fd580000.ethernet: GENET 5.0 EPHY: 0x0000
    ...
    could not attach to PHY

    drm/msm/dpu: Fix error return code in dpu_mdss_init()
    
    [ Upstream commit e020ac961ce5d038de66dc7f6ffca98899e9a3f3 ]
    
    The error code returned by platform_get_irq() is stored in 'irq', it's
    forgotten to be copied to 'ret' before being returned. As a result, the
    value 0 of 'ret' is returned incorrectly.
    
    After the above fix is completed, initializing the local variable 'ret'
    to 0 is no longer needed, remove it.
    
    In addition, when dpu_mdss_init() is successfully returned, the value of
    'ret' is always 0. Therefore, replace "return ret" with "return 0" to make
    the code clearer.

    drm/msm/dp: handle irq_hpd with sink_count = 0 correctly
    
    [ Upstream commit f21c8a276c2daddddf58d483b49b01d0603f0316 ]
    
    irq_hpd interrupt should be handled after dongle plugged in and
    before dongle unplugged. Hence irq_hpd interrupt is enabled at
    the end of the plugin handle and disabled at the beginning of
    unplugged handle. Current irq_hpd with sink_count = 0 is wrongly
    handled same as the dongle unplugged which tears down the mainlink
    and disables the phy. This patch fixes this problem by only tearing
    down the mainlink but keeping phy enabled at irq_hpd with
    sink_count = 0 handle so that next irq_hpd with sink_count =1 can be
    handled by setup mainlink only. This patch also set dongle into D3
    (power off) state at end of handling irq_hpd with sink_count = 0.
    
    Changes in v2:
    -- add ctrl->phy_Power_count
    
    Changes in v3:
    -- del ctrl->phy_Power_count
    -- add phy_power_off to dp_ctrl_off_link_stream()

    bpf: Fix null ptr deref with mixed tail calls and subprogs
    
    [ Upstream commit 7506d211b932870155bcb39e3dd9e39fab45a7c7 ]
    
    The sub-programs prog->aux->poke_tab[] is populated in jit_subprogs() and
    then used when emitting 'BPF_JMP|BPF_TAIL_CALL' insn->code from the
    individual JITs. The poke_tab[] to use is stored in the insn->imm by
    the code adding it to that array slot. The JIT then uses imm to find the
    right entry for an individual instruction. In the x86 bpf_jit_comp.c
    this is done by calling emit_bpf_tail_call_direct with the poke_tab[]
    of the imm value.
    
    However, we observed the below null-ptr-deref when mixing tail call
    programs with subprog programs. For this to happen we just need to
    mix bpf-2-bpf calls and tailcalls with some extra calls or instructions
    that would be patched later by one of the fixup routines. So whats
    happening?
    
    Before the fixup_call_args() -- where the jit op is done -- various
    code patching is done by do_misc_fixups(). This may increase the
    insn count, for example when we patch map_lookup_up using map_gen_lookup
    hook. This does two things. First, it means the instruction index,
    insn_idx field, of a tail call instruction will move by a 'delta'.
    
    In verifier code,
    
     struct bpf_jit_poke_descriptor desc = {
      .reason = BPF_POKE_REASON_TAIL_CALL,
      .tail_call.map = BPF_MAP_PTR(aux->map_ptr_state),
      .tail_call.key = bpf_map_key_immediate(aux),
      .insn_idx = i + delta,
     };
    
    Then subprog start values subprog_info[i].start will be updated
    with the delta and any poke descriptor index will also be updated
    with the delta in adjust_poke_desc(). If we look at the adjust
    subprog starts though we see its only adjusted when the delta
    occurs before the new instructions,
    
            /* NOTE: fake 'exit' subprog should be updated as well. */
            for (i = 0; i <= env->subprog_cnt; i++) {
                    if (env->subprog_info[i].start <= off)
                            continue;
    
    Earlier subprograms are not changed because their start values
    are not moved. But, adjust_poke_desc() does the offset + delta
    indiscriminately. The result is poke descriptors are potentially
    corrupted.
    
    Then in jit_subprogs() we only populate the poke_tab[]
    when the above insn_idx is less than the next subprogram start. From
    above we corrupted our insn_idx so we might incorrectly assume a
    poke descriptor is not used in a subprogram omitting it from the
    subprogram. And finally when the jit runs it does the deref of poke_tab
    when emitting the instruction and crashes with below. Because earlier
    step omitted the poke descriptor.
    
    The fix is straight forward with above context. Simply move same logic
    from adjust_subprog_starts() into adjust_poke_descs() and only adjust
    insn_idx when needed.

    Resetting software indexes in bcm4908_dma_alloc_buf_descs() is not
    enough as it's called during device probe only. Driver resets DMA on
    every .ndo_open callback and it's required to reset indexes then.
    
    This fixes inconsistent rings state and stalled traffic after interface

    ip6_tunnel: fix GRE6 segmentation
    
    [ Upstream commit a6e3f2985a80ef6a45a17d2d9d9151f17ea3ce07 ]
    
    Commit 6c11fbf97e69 ("ip6_tunnel: add MPLS transmit support")
    moved assiging inner_ipproto down from ipxip6_tnl_xmit() to
    its callee ip6_tnl_xmit(). The latter is also used by GRE.
    
    Since commit 38720352412a ("gre: Use inner_proto to obtain inner
    header protocol") GRE had been depending on skb->inner_protocol
    during segmentation. It sets it in gre_build_header() and reads
    it in gre_gso_segment(). Changes to ip6_tnl_xmit() overwrite
    the protocol, resulting in GSO skbs getting dropped.
    
    Note that inner_protocol is a union with inner_ipproto,
    GRE uses the former while the change switched it to the latter
    (always setting it to just IPPROTO_GRE).
    
    Restore the original location of skb_set_inner_ipproto(),
    it is unclear why it was moved in the first place.

    mptcp: avoid race on msk state changes
    
    [ Upstream commit 490274b47468793e3e157c2df6b2da0e646cc4a9 ]
    
    The msk socket state is currently updated in a few spots without
    owning the msk socket lock itself.
    
    Some of such operations are safe, as they happens before exposing
    the msk socket to user-space and can't race with other changes.
    
    A couple of them, at connect time, can actually race with close()
    or shutdown(), leaving breaking the socket state machine.
    
    This change addresses the issue moving such update under the msk
    socket lock with the usual:
    
    <acquire spinlock>
    <check sk lock onwers>
    <ev defer to release_cb>
    
    scheme.

    bpf: Fix integer overflow in argument calculation for bpf_map_area_alloc
    
    [ Upstream commit 7dd5d437c258bbf4cc15b35229e5208b87b8b4e0 ]
    
    In 32-bit architecture, the result of sizeof() is a 32-bit integer so
    the expression becomes the multiplication between 2 32-bit integer which
    can potentially leads to integer overflow. As a result,
    bpf_map_area_alloc() allocates less memory than needed.

    bpf: Fix regression on BPF_OBJ_GET with non-O_RDWR flags
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dec6d96d12d33900ec315972c8e47a73bcc378d ]
    
    This reverts commit d37300ed1821 ("bpf: program: Refuse non-O_RDWR flags
    in BPF_OBJ_GET"). It breaks Android userspace which expects to be able to
    fetch programs with just read permissions.
    
    See: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/libs/net/common/native/bpf_syscall_wrappers/include/BpfSyscallWrappers.h;drc=7005c764be23d31fa1d69e826b4a2f6689a8c81e;l=124
    
    Side-note: another option to fix it would be to extend bpf_prog_new_fd()
    and to pass in used file mode flags in the same way as we do for maps via
    bpf_map_new_fd(). Meaning, they'd end up in anon_inode_getfd() and thus
    would be retained for prog fd operations with bpf() syscall. Right now
    these flags are not checked with progs since they are immutable for their
    lifetime (as opposed to maps which can be updated from user space). In
    future this could potentially change with new features, but at that point
    it's still fine to do the bpf_prog_new_fd() extension when needed. For a
    simple stable fix, a revert is less churn.

    xfrm: Fix xfrm offload fallback fail case
    
    [ Upstream commit dd72fadf2186fc8a6018f97fe72f4d5ca05df440 ]
    
    In case of xfrm offload, if xdo_dev_state_add() of driver returns
    -EOPNOTSUPP, xfrm offload fallback is failed.
    In xfrm state_add() both xso->dev and xso->real_dev are initialized to
    dev and when err(-EOPNOTSUPP) is returned only xso->dev is set to null.
    
    So in this scenario the condition in func validate_xmit_xfrm(),
    if ((x->xso.dev != dev) && (x->xso.real_dev == dev))
                    return skb;
    returns true, due to which skb is returned without calling esp_xmit()
    below which has fallback code. Hence the CRYPTO_FALLBACK is failing.
    
    So fixing this with by keeping x->xso.real_dev as NULL when err is
    returned in func xfrm_dev_state_add().

    net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Fix adding vlan 0
    
    [ Upstream commit b8b79c414eca4e9bcab645e02cb92c48db974ce9 ]
    
    8021q module adds vlan 0 to all interfaces when it starts.
    When 8021q module is loaded it isn't possible to create bond
    with mv88e6xxx interfaces, bonding module dipslay error
    "Couldn't add bond vlan ids", because it tries to add vlan 0
    to slave interfaces.
    
    There is unexpected behavior in the switch. When a PVID
    is assigned to a port the switch changes VID to PVID
    in ingress frames with VID 0 on the port. Expected
    that the switch doesn't assign PVID to tagged frames
    with VID 0. But there isn't a way to change this behavior
    in the switch.

    [ Upstream commit 1502328f17ab0684ca5ed6764433aa0a83bdaf95 ]
    
    When receiving 32 bits DSS ack from the peer, the MPTCP need
    to expand them to 64 bits value. The current code is buggy
    WRT detecting 32 bits ack wrap-around: when the wrap-around
    happens the current unsigned 32 bit ack value is lower than
    the previous one.
    
    Additionally check for possible reverse wrap and make the helper
    visible, so that we could re-use it for the next patch.

    Remove flow rule release from the offload commit path, otherwise error
    from the offload commit phase might trigger a double-free due to the
    execution of the abort_offload -> abort. After this patch, the abort
    path takes care of releasing the flow rule.
    
    This fix also needs to move the nft_flow_rule_create() call before the
    transaction object is added otherwise the abort path might find a NULL
    pointer to the flow rule object for the NFT_CHAIN_HW_OFFLOAD case.
    
    While at it, rename BASIC-like goto tags to slightly more meaningful
    names rather than adding a new "err3" tag.

    tls: prevent oversized sendfile() hangs by ignoring MSG_MORE
    
    [ Upstream commit d452d48b9f8b1a7f8152d33ef52cfd7fe1735b0a ]
    
    We got multiple reports that multi_chunk_sendfile test
    case from tls selftest fails. This was sort of expected,
    as the original fix was never applied (see it in the first
    Link:). The test in question uses sendfile() with count
    larger than the size of the underlying file. This will
    make splice set MSG_MORE on all sendpage calls, meaning
    TLS will never close and flush the last partial record.
    
    Eric seem to have addressed a similar problem in
    commit 35f9c09fe9c7 ("tcp: tcp_sendpages() should call tcp_push() once")
    by introducing MSG_SENDPAGE_NOTLAST. Unlike MSG_MORE
    MSG_SENDPAGE_NOTLAST is not set on the last call
    of a "pipefull" of data (PIPE_DEF_BUFFERS == 16,
    so every 16 pages or whenever we run out of data).
    
    Having a break every 16 pages should be fine, TLS
    can pack exactly 4 pages into a record, so for
    aligned reads there should be no difference,
    unaligned may see one extra record per sendpage().
    
    Sticking to TCP semantics seems preferable to modifying
    splice, but we can revisit it if real life scenarios
    show a regression.

    net: sched: add barrier to ensure correct ordering for lockless qdisc
    
    [ Upstream commit 89837eb4b2463c556a123437f242d6c2bc62ce81 ]
    
    The spin_trylock() was assumed to contain the implicit
    barrier needed to ensure the correct ordering between
    STATE_MISSED setting/clearing and STATE_MISSED checking
    in commit a90c57f2cedd ("net: sched: fix packet stuck
    problem for lockless qdisc").
    
    But it turns out that spin_trylock() only has load-acquire
    semantic, for strongly-ordered system(like x86), the compiler
    barrier implicitly contained in spin_trylock() seems enough
    to ensure the correct ordering. But for weakly-orderly system
    (like arm64), the store-release semantic is needed to ensure
    the correct ordering as clear_bit() and test_bit() is store
    operation, see queued_spin_lock().
    
    So add the explicit barrier to ensure the correct ordering
    for the above case.

    vrf: do not push non-ND strict packets with a source LLA through packet taps again
    
    [ Upstream commit 603113c514e95c3350598bc3cccbd03af7ea4ab2 ]
    
    Non-ND strict packets with a source LLA go through the packet taps
    again, while non-ND strict packets with other source addresses do not,
    and we can see a clone of those packets on the vrf interface (we should
    not). This is due to a series of changes:
    
    Commit 6f12fa775530[1] made non-ND strict packets not being pushed again
    in the packet taps. This changed with commit 205704c618af[2] for those
    packets having a source LLA, as they need a lookup with the orig_iif.
    
    The issue now is those packets do not skip the 'vrf_ip6_rcv' function to
    the end (as the ones without a source LLA) and go through the check to
    call packet taps again. This check was changed by commit 6f12fa775530[1]
    and do not exclude non-strict packets anymore. Packets matching
    'need_strict && !is_ndisc && is_ll_src' are now being sent through the
    packet taps again. This can be seen by dumping packets on the vrf
    interface.
    
    Fix this by having the same code path for all non-ND strict packets and
    selectively lookup with the orig_iif for those with a source LLA. This
    has the effect to revert to the pre-205704c618af[2] condition, which
    should also be easier to maintain.

    selftests/bpf: Retry for EAGAIN in udp_redir_to_connected()
    
    [ Upstream commit a7e65fe7d8201527129206754db1a2db6a6b2fde ]
    
    We use non-blocking sockets for testing sockmap redirections,
    and got some random EAGAIN errors from UDP tests.
    
    There is no guarantee the packet would be immediately available
    to receive as soon as it is sent out, even on the local host.
    For UDP, this is especially true because it does not lock the
    sock during BH (unlike the TCP path). This is probably why we
    only saw this error in UDP cases.
    
    No matter how hard we try to make the queue empty check accurate,
    it is always possible for recvmsg() to beat ->sk_data_ready().
    Therefore, we should just retry in case of EAGAIN.

    net: ethernet: ezchip: fix error handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 0de449d599594f5472e00267d651615c7f2c6c1d ]
    
    As documented at drivers/base/platform.c for platform_get_irq:
    
     * Gets an IRQ for a platform device and prints an error message if finding the
     * IRQ fails. Device drivers should check the return value for errors so as to
     * not pass a negative integer value to the request_irq() APIs.
    
    So, the driver should check that platform_get_irq() return value
    is _negative_, not that it's equal to zero, because -ENXIO (return
    value from request_irq() if irq was not found) will
    pass this check and it leads to passing negative irq to request_irq()

    mt76: mt7915: fix rx fcs error count in testmode
    
    [ Upstream commit 89043529c8b833d87391f1844e9d1cc1643393eb ]
    
    FCS error packets are filtered by default and won't be reported to
    driver, so that RX fcs error and PER in testmode always show zero.
    Fix this issue by reading fcs error count from hw counter.
    
    We did't fix this issue by disabling fcs error rx filter since it may
    let HW suffer some SER errors.

    Currently rtrs when create_qp use a coarse numbers (bigger in general),
    which leads to hardware create more resources which only waste memory with

    For max_send_wr, we don't really need alway max_qp_wr size when creating
    qp, reduce it to cq_size.
    
    For max_recv_wr,  cq_size is enough.
    
    With the patch when sess_queue_depth=128, per session (2 paths) memory
    consumption reduced from 188 MB to 65MB
    
    When always_invalidate is enabled, we need send more wr, so treat it

    bpf: Fix libelf endian handling in resolv_btfids
    
    [ Upstream commit 61e8aeda9398925f8c6fc290585bdd9727d154c4 ]
    
    The vmlinux ".BTF_ids" ELF section is declared in btf_ids.h to hold a list
    of zero-filled BTF IDs, which is then patched at link-time with correct
    values by resolv_btfids. The section is flagged as "allocable" to preclude
    compression, but notably the section contents (BTF IDs) are untyped.
    
    When patching the BTF IDs, resolve_btfids writes in host-native endianness
    and relies on libelf for any required translation on reading and updating
    vmlinux. However, since the type of the .BTF_ids section content defaults
    to ELF_T_BYTE (i.e. unsigned char), no translation occurs. This results in
    incorrect patched values when cross-compiling to non-native endianness,
    and can manifest as kernel Oops and test failures which are difficult to
    troubleshoot [1].
    
    Explicitly set the type of patched data to ELF_T_WORD, the architecture-
    neutral ELF type corresponding to the u32 BTF IDs. This enables libelf to
    transparently perform any needed endian conversions.

    xsk: Fix broken Tx ring validation
    
    [ Upstream commit f654fae47e83e56b454fbbfd0af0a4f232e356d6 ]
    
    Fix broken Tx ring validation for AF_XDP. The commit under the Fixes
    tag, fixed an off-by-one error in the validation but introduced
    another error. Descriptors are now let through even if they straddle a
    chunk boundary which they are not allowed to do in aligned mode. Worse
    is that they are let through even if they straddle the end of the umem
    itself, tricking the kernel to read data outside the allowed umem
    region which might or might not be mapped at all.
    
    Fix this by reintroducing the old code, but subtract the length by one
    to fix the off-by-one error that the original patch was
    addressing. The test chunk != chunk_end makes sure packets do not
    straddle chunk boundraries. Note that packets of zero length are
    allowed in the interface, therefore the test if the length is
    non-zero.

    xsk: Fix missing validation for skb and unaligned mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 2f99619820c2269534eb2c0cde44870313c6d353 ]
    
    Fix a missing validation of a Tx descriptor when executing in skb mode
    and the umem is in unaligned mode. A descriptor could point to a
    buffer straddling the end of the umem, thus effectively tricking the
    kernel to read outside the allowed umem region. This could lead to a
    kernel crash if that part of memory is not mapped.
    
    In zero-copy mode, the descriptor validation code rejects such
    descriptors by checking a bit in the DMA address that tells us if the
    next page is physically contiguous or not. For the last page in the
    umem, this bit is not set, therefore any descriptor pointing to a
    packet straddling this last page boundary will be rejected. However,
    the skb path does not use this bit since it copies out data and can do
    so to two different pages. (It also does not have the array of DMA
    address, so it cannot even store this bit.) The code just returned
    that the packet is always physically contiguous. But this is
    unfortunately also returned for the last page in the umem, which means
    that packets that cross the end of the umem are being allowed, which
    they should not be.
    
    Fix this by introducing a check for this in the SKB path only, not
    penalizing the zero-copy path.

    This is bad because:
    
        1) test_progs.h is a checked in file

    RDMA/rxe: Fix qp reference counting for atomic ops
    
    [ Upstream commit 15ae1375ea91ae2dee6f12d71a79d8c0a10a30bf ]
    
    Currently the rdma_rxe driver attempts to protect atomic responder
    resources by taking a reference to the qp which is only freed when the
    resource is recycled for a new read or atomic operation. This means that
    in normal circumstances there is almost always an extra qp reference once
    an atomic operation has been executed which prevents cleaning up the qp
    and associated pd and cqs when the qp is destroyed.
    
    This patch removes the call to rxe_add_ref() in send_atomic_ack() and the
    call to rxe_drop_ref() in free_rd_atomic_resource(). If the qp is
    destroyed while a peer is retrying an atomic op it will cause the
    operation to fail which is acceptable.

    cw1200: Revert unnecessary patches that fix unreal use-after-free bugs
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f60f4685699aa6006e58e424637e8e413e0a94d ]
    
    A previous commit 4f68ef64cd7f ("cw1200: Fix concurrency
    use-after-free bugs in cw1200_hw_scan()") tried to fix a seemingly
    use-after-free bug between cw1200_bss_info_changed() and
    cw1200_hw_scan(), where the former frees a sk_buff pointed
    to by frame.skb, and the latter accesses the sk_buff
    pointed to by frame.skb. However, this issue should be a
    false alarm because:
    
    (1) "frame.skb" is not a shared variable between the above
    two functions, because "frame" is a local function variable,
    each of the two functions has its own local "frame" - they
    just happen to have the same variable name.
    
    (2) the sk_buff(s) pointed to by these two "frame.skb" are
    also two different object instances, they are individually
    allocated by different dev_alloc_skb() within the two above
    functions. To free one object instance will not invalidate
    the access of another different one.
    
    Based on these facts, the previous commit should be unnecessary.
    Moreover, it also introduced a missing unlock which was
    addressed in a subsequent commit 51c8d24101c7 ("cw1200: fix missing
    unlock on error in cw1200_hw_scan()"). Now that the
    original use-after-free is unreal, these two commits should
    be reverted. This patch performs the reversion.

    [ Upstream commit feb45643762172110cb3a44f99dd54304f33b711 ]
    
    The sinfo->chains field is a bitmask for filled values in chain_signal
    and chain_signal_avg, not a count. Treat it as such so that the driver
    can properly report per-chain RSSI information.
    
    Before (MIMO mode):
    
      $ iw dev wlan0 station dump
          ...
          signal: -51 [-51] dBm
    
    After (MIMO mode):
    
      $ iw dev wlan0 station dump
          ...
          signal: -53 [-53, -54] dBm

    net: wwan: Fix WWAN config symbols
    
    [ Upstream commit 89212e160b81e778f829b89743570665810e3b13 ]
    
    There is not strong reason to have both WWAN and WWAN_CORE symbols,
    Let's build the WWAN core framework when WWAN is selected, in the
    same way as for other subsystems.

    wcn36xx: Move hal_buf allocation to devm_kmalloc in probe
    
    [ Upstream commit ef48667557c53d4b51a1ee3090eab7699324c9de ]
    
    Right now wcn->hal_buf is allocated in wcn36xx_start(). This is a problem
    since we should have setup all of the buffers we required by the time
    ieee80211_register_hw() is called.
    
    struct ieee80211_ops callbacks may run prior to mac_start() and therefore
    wcn->hal_buf must be initialized.
    
    This is easily remediated by moving the allocation to probe() taking the
    opportunity to tidy up freeing memory by using devm_kmalloc().

    [ Upstream commit 272fdc0c4542fad173b44965be02a16d6db95499 ]
    
    kernel test robot reports over 200 build errors and warnings
    that are due to this Kconfig problem when CARL9170=m,
    MAC80211=y, and LEDS_CLASS=m.
    
    WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for MAC80211_LEDS

    CARL9170_LEDS selects MAC80211_LEDS even though its kconfig
    dependencies are not met. This happens because 'select' does not follow
    any Kconfig dependency chains.
    
    Fix this by making CARL9170_LEDS depend on MAC80211_LEDS, where
    the latter supplies any needed dependencies on LEDS_CLASS.

    clk: vc5: fix output disabling when enabling a FOD
    
    [ Upstream commit fc336ae622df0ec114dbe5551a4d2760c535ecd0 ]
    
    On 5P49V6965, when an output is enabled we enable the corresponding
    FOD. When this happens for the first time, and specifically when writing
    register VC5_OUT_DIV_CONTROL in vc5_clk_out_prepare(), all other outputs
    are stopped for a short time and then restarted.
    
    According to Renesas support this is intended: "The reason for that is VC6E
    has synced up all output function".
    
    This behaviour can be disabled at least on VersaClock 6E devices, of which
    only the 5P49V6965 is currently implemented by this driver. This requires
    writing bit 7 (bypass_sync{1..4}) in register 0x20..0x50.  Those registers
    are named "Unused Factory Reserved Register", and the bits are documented
    as "Skip VDDO<N> verification", which does not clearly explain the relation
    to FOD sync. However according to Renesas support as well as my testing
    setting this bit does prevent disabling of all clock outputs when enabling
    a FOD.
    
    See "VersaClock ® 6E Family Register Descriptions and Programming Guide"
    (August 30, 2018), Table 116 "Power Up VDD check", page 58:

    If the of_get_named_gpio_flags call fails in vc4_hdmi_bind, we jump to
    the err_unprepare_hsm label. That label will then call
    pm_runtime_disable and put_device on the DDC device.
    
    We just retrieved the DDC device, so the latter is definitely justified.
    However at that point we still haven't called pm_runtime_enable, so the
    call to pm_runtime_disable is not supposed to be there.

    IB/cm: Improve the calling of cm_init_av_for_lap and cm_init_av_by_path
    
    [ Upstream commit 7345201c39633fc4c82dae7315da7154efaf2459 ]
    
    The cm_init_av_for_lap() and cm_init_av_by_path() function calls have the
    following issues:
    
    1. Both of them might sleep and should not be called under spinlock.
    2. The access of cm_id_priv->av should be under cm_id_priv->lock, which
       means it can't be initialized directly.
    
    This patch splits the calling of 2 functions into two parts: first one
    initializes an AV outside of the spinlock, the second one copies AV to
    cm_id_priv->av under spinlock.

    This is being used with two quite different flows, one attaches the
    message to the priv and the other does not.
    
    Ensure the message attach is consistently done under the spinlock and
    ensure that the free on error always detaches the message from the
    cm_id_priv, also always under lock.
    
    This makes read/write to the cm_id_priv->msg consistently locked and
    consistently NULL'd when the message is freed, even in all error paths.

    net/sched: act_vlan: Fix modify to allow 0
    
    [ Upstream commit 9c5eee0afca09cbde6bd00f77876754aaa552970 ]
    
    Currently vlan modification action checks existence of vlan priority by
    comparing it to 0. Therefore it is impossible to modify existing vlan
    tag to have priority 0.
    
    For example, the following tc command will change the vlan id but will
    not affect vlan priority:
    
    tc filter add dev eth1 ingress matchall action vlan modify id 300 \
            priority 0 pipe mirred egress redirect dev eth2
    
    The incoming packet on eth1:
    
    ethertype 802.1Q (0x8100), vlan 200, p 4, ethertype IPv4
    
    will be changed to:
    
    ethertype 802.1Q (0x8100), vlan 300, p 4, ethertype IPv4
    
    although the user has intended to have p == 0.
    
    The fix is to add tcfv_push_prio_exists flag to struct tcf_vlan_params
    and rely on it when deciding to set the priority.

    xfrm: remove the fragment check for ipv6 beet mode
    
    [ Upstream commit eebd49a4ffb420a991c606e54aa3c9f02857a334 ]
    
    In commit 68dc022d04eb ("xfrm: BEET mode doesn't support fragments
    for inner packets"), it tried to fix the issue that in TX side the
    packet is fragmented before the ESP encapping while in the RX side
    the fragments always get reassembled before decapping with ESP.
    
    This is not true for IPv6. IPv6 is different, and it's using exthdr
    to save fragment info, as well as the ESP info. Exthdrs are added
    in TX and processed in RX both in order. So in the above case, the
    ESP decapping will be done earlier than the fragment reassembling
    in TX side.
    
    Here just remove the fragment check for the IPv6 inner packets to
    recover the fragments support for BEET mode.

    RDMA/rtrs-srv: Fix memory leak of unfreed rtrs_srv_stats object
    
    [ Upstream commit 2371c40354509746e4a4dad09a752e027a30f148 ]
    
    When closing a session, currently the rtrs_srv_stats object in the
    closing session is freed by kobject release. But if it failed
    to create a session by various reasons, it must free the rtrs_srv_stats
    object directly because kobject is not created yet.
    
    This problem is found by kmemleak as below:
    
    1. One client machine maps /dev/nullb0 with session name 'bla':
    root@test1:~# echo "sessname=bla path=ip:192.168.122.190 \
    device_path=/dev/nullb0" > /sys/devices/virtual/rnbd-client/ctl/map_device
    
    2. Another machine failed to create a session with the same name 'bla':
    root@test2:~# echo "sessname=bla path=ip:192.168.122.190 \
    device_path=/dev/nullb1" > /sys/devices/virtual/rnbd-client/ctl/map_device
    -bash: echo: write error: Connection reset by peer
    
    3. The kmemleak on server machine reported an error:

    RDMA/rtrs: Do not reset hb_missed_max after re-connection
    
    [ Upstream commit 64bce1ee978491a779eb31098b21c57d4e431d6a ]
    
    When re-connecting, it resets hb_missed_max to 0.
    Before the first re-connecting, client will trigger re-connection
    when it gets hb-ack more than 5 times. But after the first
    re-connecting, clients will do re-connection whenever it does
    not get hb-ack because hb_missed_max is 0.
    
    There is no need to reset hb_missed_max when re-connecting.
    hb_missed_max should be kept until closing the session.

    RDMA/rtrs-clt: Check state of the rtrs_clt_sess before reading its stats
    
    [ Upstream commit 41db63a7efe1c8c2dd282c1849a6ebfbbedbaf67 ]
    
    When get_next_path_min_inflight is called to select the next path, it
    iterates over the list of available rtrs_clt_sess (paths). It then reads
    the number of inflight IOs for that path to select one which has the least
    inflight IO.
    
    But it may so happen that rtrs_clt_sess (path) is no longer in the
    connected state because closing or error recovery paths can change the status
    of the rtrs_clt_Sess.
    
    For example, the client sent the heart-beat and did not get the
    response, it would change the session status and stop IO processing.
    The added checking of this patch can prevent accessing the broken path
    and generating duplicated error messages.
    
    It is ok if the status is changed after checking the status because
    the error recovery path does not free memory and only tries to
    reconnection. And also it is ok if the session is closed after checking
    the status because closing the session changes the session status and
    flush all IO beforing free memory. If the session is being accessed for
    IO processing, the closing session will wait.

    drm/rockchip: dsi: move all lane config except LCDC mux to bind()
    
    [ Upstream commit 43c2de1002d2b70fb5941fa14e97a34e3dc214d4 ]
    
    When we first enable the DSI encoder, we currently program some per-chip
    configuration that we look up in rk3399_chip_data based on the device
    tree compatible we match. This data configures various parameters of the
    MIPI lanes, including on RK3399 whether DSI1 is slaved to DSI0 in a
    dual-mode configuration. It also selects which LCDC (i.e. VOP) to scan
    out from.
    
    This causes a problem in RK3399 dual-mode configurations, though: panel
    prepare() callbacks run before the encoder gets enabled and expect to be
    able to write commands to the DSI bus, but the bus isn't fully
    functional until the lane and master/slave configuration have been
    programmed. As a result, dual-mode panels (and possibly others too) fail
    to turn on when the rockchipdrm driver is initially loaded.
    
    Because the LCDC mux is the only thing we don't know until enable time
    (and is the only thing that can ever change), we can actually move most
    of the initialization to bind() and get it out of the way early. That's
    what this change does. (Rockchip's 4.4 BSP kernel does it in mode_set(),
    which also avoids the issue, but bind() seems like the more correct
    place to me.)
    
    Tested on a Google Scarlet board (Acer Chromebook Tab 10), which has a
    Kingdisplay KD097D04 dual-mode panel. Prior to this change, the panel's
    backlight would turn on but no image would appear when initially loading
    rockchipdrm. If I kept rockchipdrm loaded and reloaded the panel driver,
    it would come on. With this change, the panel successfully turns on
    during initial rockchipdrm load as expected.

    drm/vc4: crtc: Lookup the encoder from the register at boot
    
    [ Upstream commit b601c16b7ba8f3bb7a7e773b238da6b63657fa1d ]
    
    At boot, we can't rely on the vc4_get_crtc_encoder since we don't have a
    state yet and thus will not be able to figure out which connector is
    attached to our CRTC.
    
    However, we have a muxing bit in the CRTC register we can use to get the
    encoder currently connected to the pixelvalve. We can thus read that
    register, lookup the associated register through the vc4_pv_data
    structure, and then pass it to vc4_crtc_disable so that we can perform
    the proper operations.

    [ Upstream commit 5a184d959d5a5a66b377cb5cd4c95a80388e0c88 ]
    
    The vc4_get_crtc_encoder function currently only works when the
    connector->state->crtc pointer is set, which is only true when the
    connector is currently enabled.
    
    However, we use it as part of the disable path as well, and our lookup
    will fail in that case, resulting in it returning a null pointer we
    can't act on.
    
    We can access the connector that used to be connected to that crtc
    though using the old connector state in the disable path.
    
    Since we want to support both the enable and disable path, we can
    support it by passing the state accessor variant as a function pointer,
    together with the atomic state.

    clk: sunxi-ng: v3s: fix incorrect postdivider on pll-audio
    
    [ Upstream commit 47e4dc4e63e1dcb8eec01c4214bcefc248eb72ed ]
    
    Commit 46060be6d840 ("clk: sunxi-ng: v3s: use sigma-delta modulation for audio-pll")
    changed the audio pll on the Allwinner V3s and V3 SoCs to use
    sigma-delta modulation. In the process the declaration of fixed postdivider
    providing "pll-audio" was adjusted to provide the desired clock rates from
    the now sigma-delta modulated pll.
    However, while the divider used for calculations by the clock framework
    was adjusted the actual divider programmed into the hardware in
    sun8i_v3_v3s_ccu_init was left at "divide by four". This broke the
    "pll-audio" clock, now only providing quater the expected clock rate.
    It would in general be desirable to program the postdivider for
    "pll-audio" to four, such that a broader range of frequencies were
    available on the pll outputs. But the clock for the integrated codec
    "ac-dig" does not feature a mux that allows to select from all pll outputs
    as it is just a simple clock gate connected to "pll-audio". Thus we need
    to set the postdivider to one to be able to provide the 22.5792MHz and
    24.576MHz rates required by the internal sun4i codec.
    
    This patches fixes the incorrect clock rate by forcing the postdivider to
    one in sun8i_v3_v3s_ccu_init.

    drm/amd/display: take dc_lock in short pulse handler only
    
    [ Upstream commit d2aa1356834d845ffdac0d8c01b58aa60d1bdc65 ]
    
    [Why]
    Conditions that end up modifying the global dc state must be locked.
    However, during mst allocate payload sequence, lock is already taken.
    With StarTech 1.2 DP hub, we get an HPD RX interrupt for a reason other
    than to indicate down reply availability right after sending payload
    allocation. The handler again takes dc lock before calling the
    dc's HPD RX handler. Due to this contention, the DRM thread which waits
    for MST down reply never gets a chance to finish its waiting
    successfully and ends up timing out. Once the lock is released, the hpd
    rx handler fires and goes ahead to read from the MST HUB, but now its
    too late and the HUB doesnt lightup all displays since DRM lacks error
    handling when payload allocation fails.
    
    [How]
    Take lock only if there is a change in link status or if automated test
    pattern bit is set. The latter fixes the null pointer dereference when
    running certain DP Link Layer Compliance test.

    [ Upstream commit bc794f8c56abddf709f1f84fcb2a3c9e7d9cc9b4 ]
    
    While some SoC samples are able to lock with a PLL factor of 55, others
    samples can't. ATM, a minimum of 60 appears to work on all the samples
    I have tried.
    
    Even with 60, it sometimes takes a long time for the PLL to eventually
    lock. The documentation says that the minimum rate of these PLLs DCO
    should be 3GHz, a factor of 125. Let's use that to be on the safe side.
    
    With factor range changed, the PLL seems to lock quickly (enough) so far.
    It is still unclear if the range was the only reason for the delay.

    [ Upstream commit 88509f698c4e38e287e016e86a0445547824135c ]
    
    In cases where the dirty linear memory range spans multiple sample sheets
    in a surface, the dirty surface region is incorrectly computed.
    To do this correctly and in an optimized fashion  we would have to compute
    the dirty region of each sample sheet and compute the union of those
    regions.
    
    But assuming that cpu writing to a multisample surface is rather a corner
    case than a common case, just set the dirty region to the full surface.

    rtnetlink: avoid RCU read lock when holding RTNL
    
    [ Upstream commit a100243d95a60d74ae9bb9df1f5f2192e9aed6a7 ]
    
    When we call af_ops->set_link_af() we hold a RCU read lock
    as we retrieve af_ops from the RCU protected list, but this
    is unnecessary because we already hold RTNL lock, which is
    the writer lock for protecting rtnl_af_ops, so it is safer
    than RCU read lock. Similar for af_ops->validate_link_af().
    
    This was not a problem until we begin to take mutex lock
    down the path of ->set_link_af() in __ipv6_dev_mc_dec()
    recently. We can just drop the RCU read lock there and
    assert RTNL lock.

    drm/imx: ipuv3-plane: fix PRG modifiers after drm managed resource conversion
    
    [ Upstream commit 17b9a94656fe19aef3647c4f93d93be51697ceb1 ]
    
    The conversion to drm managed resources introduced two bugs: the plane is now
    always initialized with the linear-only list, while the list with the Vivante
    GPU modifiers should have been used when the PRG/PRE engines are present. This
    masked another issue, as ipu_plane_format_mod_supported() is now called before
    the private plane data is set up, so if a non-linear modifier is supplied in
    the plane modifier list, we run into a NULL pointer dereference checking for
    the PRG presence. To fix this just remove the check from this function, as we
    know that it will only be called with a non-linear modifier, if the plane init
    code has already determined that the PRG/PRE is present.

    xfrm: xfrm_state_mtu should return at least 1280 for ipv6
    
    [ Upstream commit b515d2637276a3810d6595e10ab02c13bfd0b63a ]
    
    Jianwen reported that IPv6 Interoperability tests are failing in an
    IPsec case where one of the links between the IPsec peers has an MTU
    of 1280. The peer generates a packet larger than this MTU, the router
    replies with a "Packet too big" message indicating an MTU of 1280.
    When the peer tries to send another large packet, xfrm_state_mtu
    returns 1280 - ipsec_overhead, which causes ip6_setup_cork to fail
    with EINVAL.
    
    We can fix this by forcing xfrm_state_mtu to return IPV6_MIN_MTU when
    IPv6 is used. After going through IPsec, the packet will then be
    fragmented to obey the actual network's PMTU, just before leaving the
    host.
    
    Currently, TFC padding is capped to PMTU - overhead to avoid
    fragementation: after padding and encapsulation, we still fit within
    the PMTU. That behavior is preserved in this patch.

    mm: memcg/slab: properly set up gfp flags for objcg pointer array
    
    [ Upstream commit 41eb5df1cbc9b302fc263ad7c9f38cfc38b4df61 ]
    
    Patch series "mm: memcg/slab: Fix objcg pointer array handling problem", v4.
    
    Since the merging of the new slab memory controller in v5.9, the page
    structure stores a pointer to objcg pointer array for slab pages.  When
    the slab has no used objects, it can be freed in free_slab() which will
    call kfree() to free the objcg pointer array in
    memcg_alloc_page_obj_cgroups().  If it happens that the objcg pointer
    array is the last used object in its slab, that slab may then be freed
    which may caused kfree() to be called again.
    
    With the right workload, the slab cache may be set up in a way that allows
    the recursive kfree() calling loop to nest deep enough to cause a kernel
    stack overflow and panic the system.  In fact, we have a reproducer that
    can cause kernel stack overflow on a s390 system involving kmalloc-rcl-256
    and kmalloc-rcl-128 slabs with the following kfree() loop recursively
    called 74 times:
    
      [ 285.520739] [<000000000ec432fc>] kfree+0x4bc/0x560 [ 285.520740]
    [<000000000ec43466>] __free_slab+0xc6/0x228 [ 285.520741]
    [<000000000ec41fc2>] __slab_free+0x3c2/0x3e0 [ 285.520742]
    [<000000000ec432fc>] kfree+0x4bc/0x560 : While investigating this issue, I
    also found an issue on the allocation side.  If the objcg pointer array
    happen to come from the same slab or a circular dependency linkage is
    formed with multiple slabs, those affected slabs can never be freed again.
    
    This patch series addresses these two issues by introducing a new set of
    kmalloc-cg-<n> caches split from kmalloc-<n> caches.  The new set will
    only contain non-reclaimable and non-dma objects that are accounted in
    memory cgroups whereas the old set are now for unaccounted objects only.
    By making this split, all the objcg pointer arrays will come from the
    kmalloc-<n> caches, but those caches will never hold any objcg pointer
    array.  As a result, deeply nested kfree() call and the unfreeable slab
    problems are now gone.
    
    This patch (of 4):
    
    Since the merging of the new slab memory controller in v5.9, the page
    structure may store a pointer to obj_cgroup pointer array for slab pages.
    Currently, only the __GFP_ACCOUNT bit is masked off.  However, the array
    is not readily reclaimable and doesn't need to come from the DMA buffer.
    So those GFP bits should be masked off as well.
    
    Do the flag bit clearing at memcg_alloc_page_obj_cgroups() to make sure
    that it is consistently applied no matter where it is called.

    mm/shmem: fix shmem_swapin() race with swapoff
    
    [ Upstream commit 2efa33fc7f6ec94a3a538c1a264273c889be2b36 ]
    
    When I was investigating the swap code, I found the below possible race
    window:
    
    CPU 1                                         CPU 2

        if (likely(si->flags & (SWP_BLKDEV | SWP_FS_OPS))) {
                                                  swapoff
                                                    ..

    Close this race window by using get/put_swap_device() to guard against
    concurrent swapoff.

    mm: mmap_lock: use local locks instead of disabling preemption
    
    [ Upstream commit 832b50725373e8c46781b7d4db104ec9cf564a6b ]
    
    mmap_lock will explicitly disable/enable preemption upon manipulating its
    local CPU variables.  This is to be expected, but in this case, it doesn't
    play well with PREEMPT_RT.  The preemption disabled code section also
    takes a spin-lock.  Spin-locks in RT systems will try to schedule, which
    is exactly what we're trying to avoid.
    
    To mitigate this, convert the explicit preemption handling to local_locks.
    Which are RT aware, and will disable migration instead of preemption when
    PREEMPT_RT=y.
    
    The faulty call trace looks like the following:
        __mmap_lock_do_trace_*()
          preempt_disable()
          get_mm_memcg_path()
            cgroup_path()
              kernfs_path_from_node()
                spin_lock_irqsave() /* Scheduling while atomic! */

    mm/debug_vm_pgtable: ensure THP availability via has_transparent_hugepage()
    
    [ Upstream commit 65ac1a60a57e2c55f2ac37f27095f6b012295e81 ]
    
    On certain platforms, THP support could not just be validated via the
    build option CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE.  Instead
    has_transparent_hugepage() also needs to be called upon to verify THP
    runtime support.  Otherwise the debug test will just run into unusable THP
    helpers like in the case of a 4K hash config on powerpc platform [1].
    This just moves all pfn_pmd() and pfn_pud() after THP runtime validation
    with has_transparent_hugepage() which prevents the mentioned problem.

    dax: fix ENOMEM handling in grab_mapping_entry()
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a14e3779dd58c16b30e56558146e5cc850ba8b0 ]
    
    grab_mapping_entry() has a bug in handling of ENOMEM condition.  Suppose
    we have a PMD entry at index i which we are downgrading to a PTE entry.
    grab_mapping_entry() will set pmd_downgrade to true, lock the entry, clear
    the entry in xarray, and decrement mapping->nrpages.  The it will call:
    
            entry = dax_make_entry(pfn_to_pfn_t(0), flags);
            dax_lock_entry(xas, entry);
    
    which inserts new PTE entry into xarray.  However this may fail allocating
    the new node.  We handle this by:
    
            if (xas_nomem(xas, mapping_gfp_mask(mapping) & ~__GFP_HIGHMEM))
                    goto retry;
    
    however pmd_downgrade stays set to true even though 'entry' returned from
    get_unlocked_entry() will be NULL now.  And we will go again through the
    downgrade branch.  This is mostly harmless except that mapping->nrpages is
    decremented again and we temporarily have an invalid entry stored in
    xarray.  Fix the problem by setting pmd_downgrade to false each time we
    lookup the entry we work with so that it matches the entry we found.

    ocfs2: fix snprintf() checking
    
    [ Upstream commit 54e948c60cc843b6e84dc44496edc91f51d2a28e ]
    
    The snprintf() function returns the number of bytes which would have been
    printed if the buffer was large enough.  In other words it can return ">=
    remain" but this code assumes it returns "== remain".
    
    The run time impact of this bug is not very severe.  The next iteration
    through the loop would trigger a WARN() when we pass a negative limit to
    snprintf().  We would then return success instead of -E2BIG.
    
    The kernel implementation of snprintf() will never return negatives so
    there is no need to check and I have deleted that dead code.

    block: fix trace completion for chained bio
    
    [ Upstream commit 60b6a7e6a0f4382cd689f9afdac816964fec2921 ]
    
    For chained bio, trace_block_bio_complete in bio_endio is currently called
    only by the parent bio once upon all chained bio completed.
    However, the sector and size for the parent bio are modified in bio_split.
    Therefore, the size and sector of the complete events might not match the
    queue events in blktrace.
    
    The original fix of bio completion trace <fbbaf700e7b1> ("block: trace
    completion of all bios.") wants multiple complete events to correspond
    to one queue event but missed this.
    
    The issue can be reproduced by md/raid5 read with bio cross chunks.
    
    To fix, move trace completion into the loop for every chained bio to call.

    [ Upstream commit 3b7180573c250eb6e2a7eec54ae91f27472332ea ]
    
    In the CPU removal path the ->offline() callback provided by the
    driver is always invoked before ->exit(), but in the cpufreq_online()
    error path it is not, so ->exit() is expected to somehow know the
    context in which it has been called and act accordingly.
    
    That is less than straightforward, so make cpufreq_online() invoke
    the driver's ->offline() callback, if present, on errors before
    ->exit() too.

    ACPI: bgrt: Fix CFI violation
    
    [ Upstream commit f37ccf8fce155d08ae2a4fb3db677911ced0c21a ]
    
    clang's Control Flow Integrity requires that every indirect call has a
    valid target, which is based on the type of the function pointer. The
    *_show() functions in this file are written as if they will be called
    from dev_attr_show(); however, they will be called from
    sysfs_kf_seq_show() because the files were created by
    sysfs_create_group() and the sysfs ops are based on kobj_sysfs_ops
    because of kobject_add_and_create(). Because the *_show() functions do
    not match the type of the show() member in struct kobj_attribute, there
    is a CFI violation.

    block, bfq: reset waker pointer with shared queues
    
    [ Upstream commit 9a2ac41b13c573703d6689f51f3e27dd658324be ]
    
    Commit 85686d0dc194 ("block, bfq: keep shared queues out of the waker
    mechanism") leaves shared bfq_queues out of the waker-detection
    mechanism. It attains this goal by not updating the pointer
    last_completed_rq_bfqq, if the last request completed belongs to a
    shared bfq_queue (so that the pointer will not point to the shared
    bfq_queue).
    
    Yet this has a side effect: the pointer last_completed_rq_bfqq keeps
    pointing, deceptively, to a bfq_queue that actually is not the last
    one to have had a request completed. As a consequence, such a
    bfq_queue may deceptively be considered as a waker of some bfq_queue,
    even of some shared bfq_queue.
    
    To address this issue, reset last_completed_rq_bfqq if the last
    request completed belongs to a shared queue.

    block, bfq: avoid delayed merge of async queues
    
    [ Upstream commit bd3664b362381c4c1473753ebedf0ab242a60d1d ]
    
    Since commit 430a67f9d616 ("block, bfq: merge bursts of newly-created
    queues"), BFQ may schedule a merge between a newly created sync
    bfq_queue, say Q2, and the last sync bfq_queue created, say Q1. To this
    goal, BFQ stores the address of Q1 in the field bic->stable_merge_bfqq
    of the bic associated with Q2. So, when the time for the possible merge
    arrives, BFQ knows which bfq_queue to merge Q2 with. In particular,
    BFQ checks for possible merges on request arrivals.
    
    Yet the same bic may also be associated with an async bfq_queue, say
    Q3. So, if a request for Q3 arrives, then the above check may happen
    to be executed while the bfq_queue at hand is Q3, instead of Q2. In
    this case, Q1 happens to be merged with an async bfq_queue. This is
    not only a conceptual mistake, because async queues are to be kept out
    of queue merging, but also a bug that leads to inconsistent states.
    
    This commits simply filters async queues out of delayed merges.

    because it will become false positive if we change queue depth. If it
    become false positive between wbt_wait() and wbt_track() when submit
    write request, it will lead to drop rqw->inflight to -1 in wbt_done(),
    which will end up trigger IO hung. Fix this issue by introduce a new

    Before commit 8fcc4ae6faf8 ("arm64: acpi: Make apei_claim_sea()

    HID: surface-hid: Fix get-report request
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b2bcc76e2ffbaff7e6ec1c62cb9c10881dc70cd ]
    
    Getting a report (e.g. feature report) from a device requires us to send
    a request indicating which report we want to retrieve and then waiting
    for the corresponding response containing that report. We already
    provide the response structure to the request call, but the request
    isn't marked as a request that expects a response. Thus the request
    returns before we receive the response and the response buffer indicates
    a zero length response due to that.
    
    This essentially means that the get-report calls are broken and will
    always indicate that a report of length zero has been read.
    
    Fix this by appropriately marking the request.

    ACPI: sysfs: Fix a buffer overrun problem with description_show()
    
    [ Upstream commit 888be6067b97132c3992866bbcf647572253ab3f ]
    
    Currently, a device description can be obtained using ACPI, if the _STR
    method exists for a particular device, and then exposed to the userspace
    via a sysfs object as a string value.
    
    If the _STR method is available for a given device then the data
    (usually a Unicode string) is read and stored in a buffer (of the
    ACPI_TYPE_BUFFER type) with a pointer to said buffer cached in the
    struct acpi_device_pnp for later access.
    
    The description_show() function is responsible for exposing the device
    description to the userspace via a corresponding sysfs object and
    internally calls the utf16s_to_utf8s() function with a pointer to the
    buffer that contains the Unicode string so that it can be converted from
    UTF16 encoding to UTF8 and thus allowing for the value to be safely
    stored and later displayed.
    
    When invoking the utf16s_to_utf8s() function, the description_show()
    function also sets a limit of the data that can be saved into a provided
    buffer as a result of the character conversion to be a total of
    PAGE_SIZE, and upon completion, the utf16s_to_utf8s() function returns
    an integer value denoting the number of bytes that have been written
    into the provided buffer.
    
    Following the execution of the utf16s_to_utf8s() a newline character
    will be added at the end of the resulting buffer so that when the value
    is read in the userspace through the sysfs object then it would include
    newline making it more accessible when working with the sysfs file
    system in the shell, etc.  Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but if
    the function utf16s_to_utf8s() happens to return the number of bytes
    written to be precisely PAGE_SIZE, then we would overrun the buffer and
    write the newline character outside the allotted space which can have
    undefined consequences or result in a failure.
    
    To fix this buffer overrun, ensure that there always is enough space
    left for the newline character to be safely appended.

    nvme-pci: look for StorageD3Enable on companion ACPI device instead
    
    [ Upstream commit e21e0243e7b0f1c2a21d21f4d115f7b37175772a ]
    
    The documentation around the StorageD3Enable property hints that it
    should be made on the PCI device.  This is where newer AMD systems set
    the property and it's required for S0i3 support.
    
    So rather than look for nodes of the root port only present on Intel
    systems, switch to the companion ACPI device for all systems.
    David Box from Intel indicated this should work on Intel as well.

    [ Upstream commit 450605c28d571eddca39a65fdbc1338add44c6d9 ]
    
    Microsoft Hypervisor expects the logical processor index to be the same

    confuses hypervisor's scheduler. That causes the root partition not boot

    This patch removes the call to cpu_physical_id and uses the CPU index
    directly for bringing up logical processor. This scheme works for both

    [ Upstream commit 84da7acc3ba53af26f15c4b0ada446127b7a7836 ]
    
    For flush request, rq->end_io() may be called two times, one is from
    timeout handling(blk_mq_check_expired()), another is from normal
    completion(__blk_mq_end_request()).
    
    Move blk_account_io_flush() after flush_rq->ref drops to zero, so
    io accounting can be done just once for flush request.

    ACPI: PM / fan: Put fan device IDs into separate header file
    
    [ Upstream commit b9370dceabb7841c5e65ce4ee4405b9db5231fc4 ]
    
    The ACPI fan device IDs are shared between the fan driver and the
    device power management code.  The former is modular, so it needs
    to include the table of device IDs for module autoloading and the
    latter needs that list to avoid attaching the generic ACPI PM domain
    to fan devices (which doesn't make sense) possibly before the fan
    driver module is loaded.
    
    Unfortunately, that requires the list of fan device IDs to be
    updated in two places which is prone to mistakes, so put it into
    a symbol definition in a separate header file so there is only one
    copy of it in case it needs to be updated again in the future.

    Commit 22f232d134e1 ("KVM: selftests: x86: Set supported CPUIDs on
    default VM") moved vcpu_set_cpuid into vm_create_with_vcpus, but
    dirty_log_test doesn't use it to create vm. So vcpu's CPUIDs is
    not set, the guest's pa_bits in kvm would be smaller than the
    value queried by userspace.
    
    However, the dirty track memory slot is in the highest GPA, the
    reserved bits in gpte would be set with wrong pa_bits.
    For shadow paging, page fault would fail in permission_fault and
    be injected into guest. Since guest doesn't have idt, it finally
    leads to vm_exit for triple fault.
    
    Move vcpu_set_cpuid into vm_vcpu_add_default to set supported
    CPUIDs on default vcpu, since almost all tests need it.

    Race detected between psi_trigger_destroy/create as shown below, which

    crypto: nx - Fix RCU warning in nx842_OF_upd_status

    The function nx842_OF_upd_status triggers a sparse RCU warning when
    it directly dereferences the RCU-protected devdata.  This appears
    to be an accident as there was another variable of the same name
    that was passed in from the caller.
    
    After it was removed (because the main purpose of using it, to
    update the status member was itself removed) the global variable
    unintenionally stood in as its replacement.
    
    This patch restores the devdata parameter.

    perf: Fix task context PMU for Hetero
    
    [ Upstream commit 012669c740e6e2afa8bdb95394d06676f933dd2d ]
    
    On HETEROGENEOUS hardware (ARM big.Little, Intel Alderlake etc.) each
    CPU might have a different hardware PMU. Since each such PMU is
    represented by a different struct pmu, but we only have a single HW
    task context.
    
    That means that the task context needs to switch PMU type when it
    switches CPUs.
    
    Not doing this means that ctx->pmu calls (pmu_{dis,en}able(),
    {start,commit,cancel}_txn() etc.) are called against the wrong PMU and
    things will go wobbly.

    spi: spi-sun6i: Fix chipselect/clock bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d7993b234c9fad8cb6bec6adfaa74694ba85ecb ]
    
    The current sun6i SPI implementation initializes the transfer too early,
    resulting in SCK going high before the transfer. When using an additional
    (gpio) chipselect with sun6i, the chipselect is asserted at a time when
    clock is high, making the SPI transfer fail.
    
    This is due to SUN6I_GBL_CTL_BUS_ENABLE being written into
    SUN6I_GBL_CTL_REG at an early stage. Moving that to the transfer
    function, hence, right before the transfer starts, mitigates that
    problem.

    lockdep/selftests: Fix selftests vs PROVE_RAW_LOCK_NESTING
    
    [ Upstream commit c0c2c0dad6a06e0c05e9a52d65f932bd54364c97 ]
    
    When PROVE_RAW_LOCK_NESTING=y many of the selftests FAILED because
    HARDIRQ context is out-of-bounds for spinlocks. Instead make the
    default hardware context the threaded hardirq context, which preserves
    the old locking rules.
    
    The wait-type specific locking selftests will have a non-threaded
    HARDIRQ variant.

    sched/uclamp: Fix uclamp_tg_restrict()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0213b7083e81f4acd69db32cb72eb4e5f220329a ]
    
    Now cpu.uclamp.min acts as a protection, we need to make sure that the
    uclamp request of the task is within the allowed range of the cgroup,
    that is it is clamp()'ed correctly by tg->uclamp[UCLAMP_MIN] and
    tg->uclamp[UCLAMP_MAX].
    
    As reported by Xuewen [1] we can have some corner cases where there's
    inversion between uclamp requested by task (p) and the uclamp values of
    the taskgroup it's attached to (tg). Following table demonstrates
    2 corner cases:
    
                       |  p  |  tg  |  effective
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
            CASE 1
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
            uclamp_min | 60% | 0%   |  60%
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
            uclamp_max | 80% | 50%  |  50%
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
            CASE 2
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
            uclamp_min | 0%  | 30%  |  30%
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
            uclamp_max | 20% | 50%  |  20%
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
    
    With this fix we get:
    
                       |  p  |  tg  |  effective
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
            CASE 1
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
            uclamp_min | 60% | 0%   |  50%
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
            uclamp_max | 80% | 50%  |  50%
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
            CASE 2
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
            uclamp_min | 0%  | 30%  |  30%
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
            uclamp_max | 20% | 50%  |  30%
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
    
    Additionally uclamp_update_active_tasks() must now unconditionally
    update both UCLAMP_MIN/MAX because changing the tg's UCLAMP_MAX for
    instance could have an impact on the effective UCLAMP_MIN of the tasks.
    
                       |  p  |  tg  |  effective
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
            old
            -----------+-----+------+-----------
            uclamp_min | 60% | 0%   |  50%
            -----------+-----+------+-----------

    sched/rt: Fix Deadline utilization tracking during policy change
    
    [ Upstream commit d7d607096ae6d378b4e92d49946d22739c047d4c ]
    
    DL keeps track of the utilization on a per-rq basis with the structure
    avg_dl. This utilization is updated during task_tick_dl(),
    put_prev_task_dl() and set_next_task_dl(). However, when the current
    running task changes its policy, set_next_task_dl() which would usually
    take care of updating the utilization when the rq starts running DL
    tasks, will not see a such change, leaving the avg_dl structure outdated.
    When that very same task will be dequeued later, put_prev_task_dl() will
    then update the utilization, based on a wrong last_update_time, leading to
    a huge spike in the DL utilization signal.
    
    The signal would eventually recover from this issue after few ms. Even
    if no DL tasks are run, avg_dl is also updated in
    __update_blocked_others(). But as the CPU capacity depends partly on the
    avg_dl, this issue has nonetheless a significant impact on the scheduler.
    
    Fix this issue by ensuring a load update when a running task changes
    its policy to DL.

    x86/sev: Make sure IRQs are disabled while GHCB is active
    
    [ Upstream commit d187f217335dba2b49fc9002aab2004e04acddee ]
    
    The #VC handler only cares about IRQs being disabled while the GHCB is
    active, as it must not be interrupted by something which could cause
    another #VC while it holds the GHCB (NMI is the exception for which the
    backup GHCB exits).
    
    Make sure nothing interrupts the code path while the GHCB is active
    by making sure that callers of __sev_{get,put}_ghcb() have disabled
    interrupts upfront.

    btrfs: clear log tree recovering status if starting transaction fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 1aeb6b563aea18cd55c73cf666d1d3245a00f08c ]
    
    When a log recovery is in progress, lots of operations have to take that
    into account, so we keep this status per tree during the operation. Long
    time ago error handling revamp patch 79787eaab461 ("btrfs: replace many
    BUG_ONs with proper error handling") removed clearing of the status in
    an error branch. Add it back as was intended in e02119d5a7b4 ("Btrfs:
    Add a write ahead tree log to optimize synchronous operations").
    
    There are probably no visible effects, log replay is done only during
    mount and if it fails all structures are cleared so the stale status
    won't be kept.

    KVM: x86/mmu: Fix pf_fixed count in tdp_mmu_map_handle_target_level()
    
    [ Upstream commit 857f84743e4b78500afae010d866675642e18e90 ]
    
    Currently pf_fixed is not increased when prefault is true.  This is not
    correct, since prefault here really means "async page fault completed".
    In that case, the original page fault from the guest was morphed into as
    async page fault and pf_fixed was not increased.  So when prefault
    indicates async page fault is completed, pf_fixed should be increased.
    
    Additionally, currently pf_fixed is also increased even when page fault
    is spurious, while legacy MMU increases pf_fixed when page fault returns
    RET_PF_EMULATE or RET_PF_FIXED.
    
    To fix above two issues, change to increase pf_fixed when return value
    is not RET_PF_SPURIOUS (RET_PF_RETRY has already been ruled out by

    KVM: x86/mmu: Fix return value in tdp_mmu_map_handle_target_level()
    
    [ Upstream commit 57a3e96d6d17ae5ac9861ef34af024a627f1c3bb ]
    
    Currently tdp_mmu_map_handle_target_level() returns 0, which is
    RET_PF_RETRY, when page fault is actually fixed.  This makes
    kvm_tdp_mmu_map() also return RET_PF_RETRY in this case, instead of
    RET_PF_FIXED.  Fix by initializing ret to RET_PF_FIXED.
    
    Note that kvm_mmu_page_fault() resumes guest on both RET_PF_RETRY and
    RET_PF_FIXED, which means in practice returning the two won't make
    difference, so this fix alone won't be necessary for stable tree.

    KVM: nVMX: Don't clobber nested MMU's A/D status on EPTP switch
    
    [ Upstream commit 272b0a998d084e7667284bdd2d0c675c6a2d11de ]
    
    Drop bogus logic that incorrectly clobbers the accessed/dirty enabling
    status of the nested MMU on an EPTP switch.  When nested EPT is enabled,
    walk_mmu points at L2's _legacy_ page tables, not L1's EPT for L2.
    
    This is likely a benign bug, as mmu->ept_ad is never consumed (since the
    MMU is not a nested EPT MMU), and stuffing mmu_role.base.ad_disabled will
    never propagate into future shadow pages since the nested MMU isn't used
    to map anything, just to walk L2's page tables.
    
    Note, KVM also does a full MMU reload, i.e. the guest_mmu will be
    recreated using the new EPTP, and thus any change in A/D enabling will be
    properly recognized in the relevant MMU.

    KVM: nVMX: Ensure 64-bit shift when checking VMFUNC bitmap
    
    [ Upstream commit 0e75225dfa4c5d5d51291f54a3d2d5895bad38da ]
    
    Use BIT_ULL() instead of an open-coded shift to check whether or not a
    function is enabled in L1's VMFUNC bitmap.  This is a benign bug as KVM
    supports only bit 0, and will fail VM-Enter if any other bits are set,
    i.e. bits 63:32 are guaranteed to be zero.
    
    Note, "function" is bounded by hardware as VMFUNC will #UD before taking
    a VM-Exit if the function is greater than 63.
    
    Before:
      if ((vmcs12->vm_function_control & (1 << function)) == 0)
       0x000000000001a916 <+118>:   mov    $0x1,%eax

    KVM: nVMX: Sync all PGDs on nested transition with shadow paging
    
    [ Upstream commit 07ffaf343e34b555c9e7ea39a9c81c439a706f13 ]
    
    Trigger a full TLB flush on behalf of the guest on nested VM-Enter and
    VM-Exit when VPID is disabled for L2.  kvm_mmu_new_pgd() syncs only the
    current PGD, which can theoretically leave stale, unsync'd entries in a
    previous guest PGD, which could be consumed if L2 is allowed to load CR3
    with PCID_NOFLUSH=1.
    
    Rename KVM_REQ_HV_TLB_FLUSH to KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH_GUEST so that it can
    be utilized for its obvious purpose of emulating a guest TLB flush.
    
    Note, there is no change the actual TLB flush executed by KVM, even
    though the fast PGD switch uses KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH_CURRENT.  When VPID is
    disabled for L2, vpid02 is guaranteed to be '0', and thus
    nested_get_vpid02() will return the VPID that is shared by L1 and L2.
    
    Generate the request outside of kvm_mmu_new_pgd(), as getting the common
    helper to correctly identify which requested is needed is quite painful.
    E.g. using KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH_GUEST when nested EPT is in play is wrong as
    a TLB flush from the L1 kernel's perspective does not invalidate EPT
    mappings.  And, by using KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH_GUEST, nVMX can do future
    simplification by moving the logic into nested_vmx_transition_tlb_flush().

    Fans 7..12 do not have their own set of configuration registers.
    So far the code ignored that and read beyond the end of the configuration
    register range to get the tachometer period. This resulted in more or less
    random fan speed values for those fans.
    
    The datasheet is quite vague when it comes to defining the tachometer
    period for fans 7..12. Experiments confirm that the period is the same
    for both fans associated with a given set of configuration registers.

    media: i2c: rdacm21: Power up OV10640 before OV490
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b821698dc73c00719e3dc367db712f727bbda85 ]
    
    The current RDACM21 initialization routine powers up the OV10640 image
    sensor after the OV490 ISP. The ISP is programmed with a firmware loaded
    from an embedded serial flash that (most probably) tries to interact and
    program also the image sensor connected to the ISP.
    
    As described in commit "media: i2c: rdacm21: Fix OV10640 powerup" the
    image sensor powerdown signal is kept high by an internal pull up
    resistor and occasionally fails to startup correctly if the powerdown
    line is not asserted explicitly. Failures in the OV10640 startup causes
    the OV490 firmware to fail to boot correctly resulting in the camera
    module initialization to fail consequentially.
    
    Fix this by powering up the OV10640 image sensor before testing the
    OV490 firmware boot completion, by splitting the ov10640_initialize()
    function in an ov10640_power_up() one and an ov10640_check_id() one.
    
    Also make sure the OV10640 identification procedure gives enough time to
    the image sensor to resume after the programming phase performed by the
    OV490 firmware by repeating the ID read procedure.
    
    This commit fixes a sporadic start-up error triggered by a failure to
    detect the OV490 firmware boot completion:

    [ Upstream commit ff75332b260cd33cc19000fdb5d256d9db4470d1 ]
    
    The OV10640 image sensor powerdown signal is controlled by the first
    line of the OV490 GPIO pad #1, but the pad #0 identifier
    OV490_GPIO_OUTPUT_VALUE0 was erroneously used. As a result the image
    sensor powerdown signal was never asserted but was left floating and
    kept high by an internal pull-up resistor, causing sporadic failures
    during the image sensor startup phase.
    
    Fix this by using the correct GPIO pad identifier and wait the mandatory
    1.5 millisecond delay after the powerup lane is asserted. The reset
    delay is not characterized in the chip manual if not as "255 XVCLK +
    initialization". Wait for at least 3 milliseconds to guarantee the SCCB
    bus is available.
    
    While at it also fix the reset sequence, as the reset line was released
    before the powerdown one, and the line was not cycled.

    read the OV10640 chip ID:

    [ Upstream commit 765ba251d2522e2a0daa2f0793fd0f0ce34816ec ]
    
    Converting the VIDIOC_DQEVENT_TIME32/VIDIOC_DQEVENT32/
    VIDIOC_DQEVENT32_TIME32 arguments to the canonical form is done in common
    code, but for some reason I ended up adding another conversion helper to
    subdev_do_ioctl() as well. I must have concluded that this does not go
    through the common conversion, but it has done that since the ioctl
    handler was first added.
    
    I assume this one is harmless as there should be no way to arrive here
    from user space if CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME is set, but since it is dead
    code, it should just get removed.
    
    On a 64-bit architecture, as well as a 32-bit architecture without
    CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME, handling this command is a mistake,
    and the kernel should return an error.

    The time32 commands are defined but were never meant to be called on
    64-bit machines, as those have always used time64 interfaces.  I missed
    this in my patch that introduced the time64 handling on 32-bit platforms.
    
    The problem in this case is the mismatch of one function checking for
    the numeric value of the command and another function checking for the
    type of process (native vs compat) instead, with the result being that
    for this combination, nothing gets copied into the buffer at all.
    
    Avoid this by only trying to convert the time32 commands when running
    on a 32-bit kernel where these are defined in a meaningful way.

    arm64/mm: Fix ttbr0 values stored in struct thread_info for software-pan
    
    [ Upstream commit 9163f01130304fab1f74683d7d44632da7bda637 ]
    
    When using CONFIG_ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN, a task's thread_info::ttbr0 must be
    the TTBR0_EL1 value used to run userspace. With 52-bit PAs, the PA must be
    packed into the TTBR using phys_to_ttbr(), but we forget to do this in some
    of the SW PAN code. Thus, if the value is installed into TTBR0_EL1 (as may
    happen in the uaccess routines), this could result in UNPREDICTABLE
    behaviour.
    
    Since hardware with 52-bit PA support almost certainly has HW PAN, which
    will be used in preference, this shouldn't be a practical issue, but let's
    fix this for consistency.

    media: siano: Fix out-of-bounds warnings in smscore_load_firmware_family2()
    
    [ Upstream commit 13dfead49db07225335d4f587a560a2210391a1a ]
    
    Rename struct sms_msg_data4 to sms_msg_data5 and increase the size of
    its msg_data array from 4 to 5 elements. Notice that at some point
    the 5th element of msg_data is being accessed in function
    smscore_load_firmware_family2():
    
    1006                 trigger_msg->msg_data[4] = 4; /* Task ID */
    
    Also, there is no need for the object _trigger_msg_ of type struct
    sms_msg_data *, when _msg_ can be used, directly. Notice that msg_data
    in struct sms_msg_data is a one-element array, which causes multiple
    out-of-bounds warnings when accessing beyond its first element
    in function smscore_load_firmware_family2():
    
     992                 struct sms_msg_data *trigger_msg =
     993                         (struct sms_msg_data *) msg;
     994
     995                 pr_debug("sending MSG_SMS_SWDOWNLOAD_TRIGGER_REQ\n");
     996                 SMS_INIT_MSG(&msg->x_msg_header,
     997                                 MSG_SMS_SWDOWNLOAD_TRIGGER_REQ,
     998                                 sizeof(struct sms_msg_hdr) +
     999                                 sizeof(u32) * 5);
    1000
    1001                 trigger_msg->msg_data[0] = firmware->start_address;
    1002                                         /* Entry point */
    1003                 trigger_msg->msg_data[1] = 6; /* Priority */
    1004                 trigger_msg->msg_data[2] = 0x200; /* Stack size */
    1005                 trigger_msg->msg_data[3] = 0; /* Parameter */
    1006                 trigger_msg->msg_data[4] = 4; /* Task ID */
    
    even when enough dynamic memory is allocated for _msg_:
    
     929         /* PAGE_SIZE buffer shall be enough and dma aligned */
     930         msg = kmalloc(PAGE_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL | coredev->gfp_buf_flags);
    
    but as _msg_ is casted to (struct sms_msg_data *):
    
     992                 struct sms_msg_data *trigger_msg =
     993                         (struct sms_msg_data *) msg;
    
    the out-of-bounds warnings are actually valid and should be addressed.
    
    Fix this by declaring object _msg_ of type struct sms_msg_data5 *,
    which contains a 5-elements array, instead of just 4. And use
    _msg_ directly, instead of creating object trigger_msg.
    
    This helps with the ongoing efforts to enable -Warray-bounds by fixing
    the following warnings:

    The direction of the pipe argument must match the request-type direction
    bit or control requests may fail depending on the host-controller-driver
    implementation.
    
    Control transfers without a data stage are treated as OUT requests by

    will now trigger a warning.

    sched: Don't defer CPU pick to migration_cpu_stop()
    
    [ Upstream commit 475ea6c60279e9f2ddf7e4cf2648cd8ae0608361 ]
    
    Will reported that the 'XXX __migrate_task() can fail' in migration_cpu_stop()
    can happen, and it *is* sort of a big deal. Looking at it some more, one
    will note there is a glaring hole in the deferred CPU selection:
    
      (w/ CONFIG_CPUSET=n, so that the affinity mask passed via taskset doesn't
      get AND'd with cpu_online_mask)
    
      $ taskset -pc 0-2 $PID
      # offline CPUs 3-4
      $ taskset -pc 3-5 $PID
        `\
          $PID may stay on 0-2 due to the cpumask_any_distribute() picking an
          offline CPU and __migrate_task() refusing to do anything due to
          cpu_is_allowed().
    
    set_cpus_allowed_ptr() goes to some length to pick a dest_cpu that matches
    the right constraints vs affinity and the online/active state of the
    CPUs. Reuse that instead of discarding it in the affine_move_task() case.

    locking/lockdep: Reduce LOCKDEP dependency list
    
    [ Upstream commit b8e00abe7d9fe21dd13609e2e3a707e38902b105 ]
    
    Some arches (um, sparc64, riscv, xtensa) cause a Kconfig warning for
    LOCKDEP.
    These arch-es select LOCKDEP_SUPPORT but they are not listed as one
    of the arch-es that LOCKDEP depends on.
    
    Since (16) arch-es define the Kconfig symbol LOCKDEP_SUPPORT if they
    intend to have LOCKDEP support, replace the awkward list of
    arch-es that LOCKDEP depends on with the LOCKDEP_SUPPORT symbol.
    
    But wait. LOCKDEP_SUPPORT is included in LOCK_DEBUGGING_SUPPORT,
    which is already a dependency here, so LOCKDEP_SUPPORT is redundant
    and not needed.
    That leaves the FRAME_POINTER dependency, but it is part of an
    expression like this:
            depends on (A && B) && (FRAME_POINTER || B')
    where B' is a dependency of B so if B is true then B' is true
    and the value of FRAME_POINTER does not matter.
    Thus we can also delete the FRAME_POINTER dependency.
    
    Fixes this kconfig warning: (for um, sparc64, riscv, xtensa)
    
    WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for LOCKDEP
      Depends on [n]: DEBUG_KERNEL [=y] && LOCK_DEBUGGING_SUPPORT [=y] && (FRAME_POINTER [=n] || MIPS || PPC || S390 || MICROBLAZE || ARM || ARC || X86)

    Actual data length of the 'secret' is not equal to the 'secret_size'.
    
    Since the 'curve_id' has removed in the 'secret', the 'secret_size'
    should subtract the length of the 'curve_id'.

    pata_octeon_cf: avoid WARN_ON() in ata_host_activate()
    
    [ Upstream commit bfc1f378c8953e68ccdbfe0a8c20748427488b80 ]
    
    Iff platform_get_irq() fails (or returns IRQ0) and thus the polling mode
    has to be used, ata_host_activate() hits the WARN_ON() due to 'irq_handler'
    parameter being non-NULL if the polling mode is selected.  Let's only set
    the pointer to the driver's IRQ handler if platform_get_irq() returns a
    valid IRQ # -- this should avoid the unnecessary WARN_ON()...

    kbuild: Fix objtool dependency for 'OBJECT_FILES_NON_STANDARD_<obj> := n'
    
    [ Upstream commit 8852c552402979508fdc395ae07aa8761aa46045 ]
    
    "OBJECT_FILES_NON_STANDARD_vma.o := n" has a dependency bug.  When
    objtool source is updated, the affected object doesn't get re-analyzed
    by objtool.
    
    Peter's new variable-sized jump label feature relies on objtool
    rewriting the object file.  Otherwise the system can fail to boot.  That
    effectively upgrades this minor dependency issue to a major bug.
    
    The problem is that variables in prerequisites are expanded early,
    during the read-in phase.  The '$(objtool_dep)' variable indirectly uses
    '$@', which isn't yet available when the target prerequisites are
    evaluated.
    
    Use '.SECONDEXPANSION:' which causes '$(objtool_dep)' to be expanded in
    a later phase, after the target-specific '$@' variable has been defined.

    sched/uclamp: Fix locking around cpu_util_update_eff()
    
    [ Upstream commit 93b73858701fd01de26a4a874eb95f9b7156fd4b ]
    
    cpu_cgroup_css_online() calls cpu_util_update_eff() without holding the
    uclamp_mutex or rcu_read_lock() like other call sites, which is
    a mistake.
    
    The uclamp_mutex is required to protect against concurrent reads and
    writes that could update the cgroup hierarchy.
    
    The rcu_read_lock() is required to traverse the cgroup data structures
    in cpu_util_update_eff().
    
    Surround the caller with the required locks and add some asserts to
    better document the dependency in cpu_util_update_eff().

    sched/uclamp: Fix wrong implementation of cpu.uclamp.min
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c18f2ecfcc274a4bcc1d122f79ebd4001c3b445 ]
    
    cpu.uclamp.min is a protection as described in cgroup-v2 Resource
    Distribution Model
    
            Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst
    
    which means we try our best to preserve the minimum performance point of
    tasks in this group. See full description of cpu.uclamp.min in the
    cgroup-v2.rst.
    
    But the current implementation makes it a limit, which is not what was
    intended.
    
    For example:
    
            tg->cpu.uclamp.min = 20%
    
            p0->uclamp[UCLAMP_MIN] = 0
            p1->uclamp[UCLAMP_MIN] = 50%
    
            Previous Behavior (limit):
    
                    p0->effective_uclamp = 0
                    p1->effective_uclamp = 20%
    
            New Behavior (Protection):
    
                    p0->effective_uclamp = 20%
                    p1->effective_uclamp = 50%
    
    Which is inline with how protections should work.
    
    With this change the cgroup and per-task behaviors are the same, as
    expected.
    
    Additionally, we remove the confusing relationship between cgroup and
    !user_defined flag.
    
    We don't want for example RT tasks that are boosted by default to max to
    change their boost value when they attach to a cgroup. If a cgroup wants
    to limit the max performance point of tasks attached to it, then
    cpu.uclamp.max must be set accordingly.
    
    Or if they want to set different boost value based on cgroup, then
    sysctl_sched_util_clamp_min_rt_default must be used to NOT boost to max
    and set the right cpu.uclamp.min for each group to let the RT tasks
    obtain the desired boost value when attached to that group.
    
    As it stands the dependency on !user_defined flag adds an extra layer of
    complexity that is not required now cpu.uclamp.min behaves properly as
    a protection.
    
    The propagation model of effective cpu.uclamp.min in child cgroups as
    implemented by cpu_util_update_eff() is still correct. The parent
    protection sets an upper limit of what the child cgroups will
    effectively get.

    media: I2C: change 'RST' to "RSET" to fix multiple build errors
    
    [ Upstream commit 8edcb5049ac29aa3c8acc5ef15dd4036543d747e ]
    
    The use of an enum named 'RST' conflicts with a #define macro
    named 'RST' in arch/mips/include/asm/mach-rc32434/rb.h.

    'git grep -w RSET' does not report any naming conflicts with the
    new name.

    media: venus: Rework error fail recover logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 4cba5473c5ce0f1389d316c5dc6f83a0259df5eb ]
    
    The Venus code has a sort of watchdog that attempts to recover
    from IP errors, implemented as a delayed work job, which
    calls venus_sys_error_handler().
    
    Right now, it has several issues:
    
    1. It assumes that PM runtime resume never fails
    
    2. It internally runs two while() loops that also assume that
       PM runtime will never fail to go idle:
    
            while (pm_runtime_active(core->dev_dec) || pm_runtime_active(core->dev_enc))
                    msleep(10);
    
    ...
    
            while (core->pmdomains[0] && pm_runtime_active(core->pmdomains[0]))
                    usleep_range(1000, 1500);
    
    3. It uses an OR to merge all return codes and then report to the user
    
    4. If the hardware never recovers, it keeps running on every 10ms,
       flooding the syslog with 2 messages (so, up to 200 messages
       per second).
    
    Rework the code, in order to prevent that, by:
    
    1. check the return code from PM runtime resume;
    2. don't let the while() loops run forever;

    spi: Avoid undefined behaviour when counting unused native CSs

    ffz(), that has been used to count unused native CSs,
    might cause undefined behaviour when called against ~0U.
    To fix that, open code it with ffs(~value) - 1.

    spi: Allow to have all native CSs in use along with GPIOs
    
    [ Upstream commit dbaca8e56ea3f23fa215f48c2d46dd03ede06e02 ]
    
    The commit 7d93aecdb58d ("spi: Add generic support for unused native cs
    with cs-gpios") excludes the valid case for the controllers that doesn't
    need to switch native CS in order to perform the transfer, i.e. when
    
      0             native
      ...           ...
      <n> - 1       native
      <n>           GPIO
      <n> + 1       GPIO
      ...           ...
    
    where <n> defines maximum of native CSs supported by the controller.
    
    To allow this, bail out from spi_get_gpio_descs() conditionally for
    the controllers which explicitly marked with SPI_MASTER_GPIO_SS.

    kbuild: skip per-CPU BTF generation for pahole v1.18-v1.21
    
    [ Upstream commit a0b8200d06ad6450c179407baa5f0f52f8cfcc97 ]
    
    Commit "mm/page_alloc: convert per-cpu list protection to local_lock" will
    introduce a zero-sized per-CPU variable, which causes pahole to generate
    invalid BTF.  Only pahole versions 1.18 through 1.21 are impacted, as
    before 1.18 pahole doesn't know anything about per-CPU variables, and 1.22
    contains the proper fix for the issue.
    
    Luckily, pahole 1.18 got --skip_encoding_btf_vars option disabling BTF
    generation for per-CPU variables in anticipation of some unanticipated
    problems.  So use this escape hatch to disable per-CPU var BTF info on
    those problematic pahole versions.  Users relying on availability of
    per-CPU var BTFs would need to upgrade to pahole 1.22+, but everyone won't
    notice any regressions.

    mm: define default MAX_PTRS_PER_* in include/pgtable.h
    
    [ Upstream commit c0f8aa4fa815daacb6eca52cae04820d6aecb7c2 ]
    
    Commit c65e774fb3f6 ("x86/mm: Make PGDIR_SHIFT and PTRS_PER_P4D variable")
    made PTRS_PER_P4D variable on x86 and introduced MAX_PTRS_PER_P4D as a
    constant for cases which need a compile-time constant (e.g.  fixed-size
    arrays).
    
    powerpc likewise has boot-time selectable MMU features which can cause
    other mm "constants" to vary.  For KASAN, we have some static
    PTE/PMD/PUD/P4D arrays so we need compile-time maximums for all these
    constants.  Extend the MAX_PTRS_PER_ idiom, and place default definitions
    in include/pgtable.h.  These define MAX_PTRS_PER_x to be PTRS_PER_x unless
    an architecture has defined MAX_PTRS_PER_x in its arch headers.
    
    Clean up pgtable-nop4d.h and s390's MAX_PTRS_PER_P4D definitions while
    we're at it: both can just pick up the default now.

    writeback, cgroup: increment isw_nr_in_flight before grabbing an inode
    
    [ Upstream commit 8826ee4fe75051f8cbfa5d4a9aa70565938e724c ]
    
    isw_nr_in_flight is used to determine whether the inode switch queue
    should be flushed from the umount path.  Currently it's increased after
    grabbing an inode and even scheduling the switch work.  It means the
    umount path can walk past cleanup_offline_cgwb() with active inode
    references, which can result in a "Busy inodes after unmount." message and
    use-after-free issues (with inode->i_sb which gets freed).
    
    Fix it by incrementing isw_nr_in_flight before doing anything with the
    inode and decrementing in the case when switching wasn't scheduled.
    
    The problem hasn't yet been seen in the real life and was discovered by
    Jan Kara by looking into the code.

    gcc points out a mistake in the mca driver that goes back to before the
    git history:
    
    arch/ia64/kernel/mca_drv.c: In function 'init_record_index_pools':
    arch/ia64/kernel/mca_drv.c:346:54: error: expression does not compute the number of elements in this array; element typ

    This is the same as sizeof(size_t), which is two shorter than the actual

    kthread_worker: fix return value when kthread_mod_delayed_work() races with kthread_cancel_delayed_work_sync()
    
    [ Upstream commit d71ba1649fa3c464c51ec7163e4b817345bff2c7 ]
    
    kthread_mod_delayed_work() might race with
    kthread_cancel_delayed_work_sync() or another kthread_mod_delayed_work()
    call.  The function lets the other operation win when it sees
    work->canceling counter set.  And it returns @false.
    
    But it should return @true as it is done by the related workqueue API, see
    mod_delayed_work_on().
    
    The reason is that the return value might be used for reference counting.
    It has to distinguish the case when the number of queued works has changed
    or stayed the same.
    
    The change is safe.  kthread_mod_delayed_work() return value is not
    checked anywhere at the moment.

    block: fix discard request merge
    
    [ Upstream commit 2705dfb2094777e405e065105e307074af8965c1 ]
    
    ll_new_hw_segment() is reached only in case of single range discard
    merge, and we don't have max discard segment size limit actually, so
    it is wrong to run the following check:
    
    if (req->nr_phys_segments + nr_phys_segs > blk_rq_get_max_segments(req))
    
    it may be always false since req->nr_phys_segments is initialized as
    one, and bio's segment count is still 1, blk_rq_get_max_segments(reg)
    is 1 too.
    
    Fix the issue by not doing the check and bypassing the calculation of
    discard request's nr_phys_segments.

    [ Upstream commit 96e39e95c01283ff5695dafe659df88ada802159 ]
    
    In adding APCS clock support for MSM8939, the second clock registration
    fails due to duplicate device name like below.
    
    [    0.519657] sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/bus/platform/devices/qcom-apcs-msm8916-clk'
    ...
    [    0.661158] qcom_apcs_ipc b111000.mailbox: failed to register APCS clk
    
    This is because MSM8939 has 3 APCS instances for Cluster0 (little cores),
    Cluster1 (big cores) and CCI (Cache Coherent Interconnect).  Although
    only APCS of Cluster0 and Cluster1 have IPC bits, each of 3 APCS has
    A53PLL clock control bits.  That said, 3 'qcom-apcs-msm8916-clk' devices
    need to be registered to instantiate all 3 clocks.  Use PLATFORM_DEVID_AUTO
    rather than PLATFORM_DEVID_NONE for platform_device_register_data() call
    to fix the issue above.

    [ Upstream commit c46ed2281bbe4b84e6f3d4bdfb0e4e9ab813fa9d ]
    
    The SPI core always reports a "MODALIAS=spi:<foo>", even if the device was

    clocksource: Check per-CPU clock synchronization when marked unstable
    
    [ Upstream commit 7560c02bdffb7c52d1457fa551b9e745d4b9e754 ]
    
    Some sorts of per-CPU clock sources have a history of going out of
    synchronization with each other.  However, this problem has purportedy been
    solved in the past ten years.  Except that it is all too possible that the
    problem has instead simply been made less likely, which might mean that
    some of the occasional "Marking clocksource 'tsc' as unstable" messages
    might be due to desynchronization.  How would anyone know?
    
    Therefore apply CPU-to-CPU synchronization checking to newly unstable
    clocksource that are marked with the new CLOCK_SOURCE_VERIFY_PERCPU flag.
    Lists of desynchronized CPUs are printed, with the caveat that if it
    is the reporting CPU that is itself desynchronized, it will appear that
    all the other clocks are wrong.  Just like in real life.

    clocksource: Retry clock read if long delays detected
    
    [ Upstream commit db3a34e17433de2390eb80d436970edcebd0ca3e ]
    
    When the clocksource watchdog marks a clock as unstable, this might be due
    to that clock being unstable or it might be due to delays that happen to
    occur between the reads of the two clocks.  Yes, interrupts are disabled
    across those two reads, but there are no shortage of things that can delay
    interrupts-disabled regions of code ranging from SMI handlers to vCPU
    preemption.  It would be good to have some indication as to why the clock
    was marked unstable.
    
    Therefore, re-read the watchdog clock on either side of the read from the
    clock under test.  If the watchdog clock shows an excessive time delta
    between its pair of reads, the reads are retried.
    
    The maximum number of retries is specified by a new kernel boot parameter
    clocksource.max_cswd_read_retries, which defaults to three, that is, up to
    four reads, one initial and up to three retries.  If more than one retry
    was required, a message is printed on the console (the occasional single
    retry is expected behavior, especially in guest OSes).  If the maximum
    number of retries is exceeded, the clock under test will be marked
    unstable.  However, the probability of this happening due to various sorts
    of delays is quite small.  In addition, the reason (clock-read delays) for
    the unstable marking will be apparent.

    block, bfq: fix delayed stable merge check
    
    [ Upstream commit e03f2ab78a4a673e4af23c3b855591c48b9de4d7 ]
    
    When attempting to schedule a merge of a given bfq_queue with the currently
    in-service bfq_queue or with a cooperating bfq_queue among the scheduled
    bfq_queues, delayed stable merge is checked for rotational or non-queueing
    devs. For this stable merge to be performed, some conditions must be met.
    If the current bfq_queue underwent some split from some merged bfq_queue,
    one of these conditions is that two hundred milliseconds must elapse from
    split, otherwise this condition is always met.
    
    Unfortunately, by mistake, time_is_after_jiffies() was written instead of
    time_is_before_jiffies() for this check, verifying that less than two
    hundred milliseconds have elapsed instead of verifying that at least two
    hundred milliseconds have elapsed.
    
    Fix this issue by replacing time_is_after_jiffies() with
    time_is_before_jiffies().

    ACPI: EC: trust DSDT GPE for certain HP laptop
    
    [ Upstream commit 4370cbf350dbaca984dbda9f9ce3fac45d6949d5 ]
    
    On HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15-cx0xxx, the ECDT EC and DSDT EC share
    the same port addresses but different GPEs. And the DSDT GPE is the
    right one to use.
    
    The current code duplicates DSDT EC with ECDT EC if the port addresses
    are the same, and uses ECDT GPE as a result, which breaks this machine.
    
    Introduce a new quirk for the HP laptop to trust the DSDT GPE,
    and avoid duplicating even if the port addresses are the same.

    cifs: retry lookup and readdir when EAGAIN is returned.
    
    [ Upstream commit 6efa994e35a402ae4ae2161b6439c94b64816cee ]
    
    According to the investigation performed by Jacob Shivers at Red Hat,
    cifs_lookup and cifs_readdir leak EAGAIN when the user session is

    cifs: improve fallocate emulation
    
    [ Upstream commit 966a3cb7c7db786452a87afdc3b48858fc4d4d6b ]
    
    RHBZ: 1866684
    
    We don't have a real fallocate in the SMB2 protocol so we used to emulate fallocate
    by simply switching the file to become non-sparse. But as that could potantially consume
    a lot more data than we intended to fallocate (large sparse file and fallocating a thin
    slice in the middle) we would only do this IFF the fallocate request was for virtually
    the entire file.
    
    This patch improves this and starts allowing us to fallocate smaller chunks of a file by
    overwriting the region with 0, for the parts that are unallocated.
    
    The method used is to first query the server for FSCTL_QUERY_ALLOCATED_RANGES to find what
    is unallocated in the fallocate range and then to only overwrite-with-zero the unallocated
    ranges to fill in the holes.
    
    As overwriting-with-zero is different from just allocating blocks, and potentially much
    more expensive, we limit this to only allow fallocate ranges up to 1Mb in size.

    [ Upstream commit 28117f3a5c3c8375a3304af76357d5bf9cf30f0b ]
    
    The quirks added to asus-nb-wmi for the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 and G15 are
    wrong, they tell the asus-wmi code to use the vendor specific WMI backlight
    interface. But there is no such interface on these laptops.
    
    As a side effect, these quirks stop the acpi_video driver to register since
    they make acpi_video_get_backlight_type() return acpi_backlight_vendor,
    leaving only the native AMD backlight driver in place, which is the one we
    want. This happy coincidence is being replaced with a new quirk in
    drivers/acpi/video_detect.c which actually sets the backlight_type to
    acpi_backlight_native fixinf this properly. This reverts
    commit 13bceda68fb9 ("platform/x86: asus-nb-wmi: add support for ASUS ROG

    block: fix race between adding/removing rq qos and normal IO
    
    [ Upstream commit 2cafe29a8d03f02a3d16193bdaae2f3e82a423f9 ]
    
    Yi reported several kernel panics on:
    
    [16687.001777] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000008
    ...
    [16687.163549] pc : __rq_qos_track+0x38/0x60
    
    or
    
    [  997.690455] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000020
    ...
    [  997.850347] pc : __rq_qos_done+0x2c/0x50
    
    Turns out it is caused by race between adding rq qos(wbt) and normal IO
    because rq_qos_add can be run when IO is being submitted, fix this issue
    by freezing queue before adding/deleting rq qos to queue.
    
    rq_qos_exit() needn't to freeze queue because it is called after queue
    has been frozen.
    
    iolatency calls rq_qos_add() during allocating queue, so freezing won't
    add delay because queue usage refcount works at atomic mode at that
    time.
    
    iocost calls rq_qos_add() when writing cgroup attribute file, that is
    fine to freeze queue at that time since we usually freeze queue when
    storing to queue sysfs attribute, meantime iocost only exists on the
    root cgroup.
    
    wbt_init calls it in blk_register_queue() and queue sysfs attribute
    store(queue_wb_lat_store() when write it 1st time in case of !BLK_WBT_MQ),
    the following patch will speedup the queue freezing in wbt_init.

    HID: sony: fix freeze when inserting ghlive ps3/wii dongles
    
    [ Upstream commit fb1a79a6b6e1223ddb18f12aa35e36f832da2290 ]
    
    This commit fixes a freeze on insertion of a Guitar Hero Live PS3/WiiU
    USB dongle. Indeed, with the current implementation, inserting one of
    those USB dongles will lead to a hard freeze. I apologize for not
    catching this earlier, it didn't occur on my old laptop.
    
    While the issue was isolated to memory alloc/free, I could not figure
    out why it causes a freeze. So this patch fixes this issue by
    simplifying memory allocation and usage.
    
    We remind that for the dongle to work properly, a control URB needs to
    be sent periodically. We used to alloc/free the URB each time this URB
    needed to be sent.
    
    With this patch, the memory for the URB is allocated on the probe, reused
    for as long as the dongle is plugged in, and freed once the dongle is
    unplugged.

    ACPI: resources: Add checks for ACPI IRQ override
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ec4e55e9f571f08970ed115ec0addc691eda613 ]
    
    The laptop keyboard doesn't work on many MEDION notebooks, but the
    keyboard works well under Windows and Unix.
    
    Through debugging, we found this log in the dmesg:
    
     ACPI: IRQ 1 override to edge, high
     pnp 00:03: Plug and Play ACPI device, IDs PNP0303 (active)
    
     And we checked the IRQ definition in the DSDT, it is:
    
        IRQ (Level, ActiveLow, Exclusive, )
            {1}
    
    So the BIOS defines the keyboard IRQ to Level_Low, but the Linux
    kernel override it to Edge_High. If the Linux kernel is modified
    to skip the IRQ override, the keyboard will work normally.
    
    From the existing comment in acpi_dev_get_irqresource(), the override
    function only needs to be called when IRQ() or IRQNoFlags() is used
    to populate the resource descriptor, and according to Section 6.4.2.1
    of ACPI 6.4 [1], if IRQ() is empty or IRQNoFlags() is used, the IRQ
    is High true, edge sensitive and non-shareable. ACPICA also assumes
    that to be the case (see acpi_rs_set_irq[] in rsirq.c).
    
    In accordance with the above, check 3 additional conditions
    (EdgeSensitive, ActiveHigh and Exclusive) when deciding whether or
    not to treat an ACPI_RESOURCE_TYPE_IRQ resource as "legacy", in which
    case the IRQ override is applicable to it.

    ACPICA: Fix memory leak caused by _CID repair function
    
    [ Upstream commit c27bac0314131b11bccd735f7e8415ac6444b667 ]
    
    ACPICA commit 180cb53963aa876c782a6f52cc155d951b26051a
    
    According to the ACPI spec, _CID returns a package containing
    hardware ID's. Each element of an ASL package contains a reference
    count from the parent package as well as the element itself.
    
    Name (TEST, Package() {
        "String object" // this package element has a reference count of 2
    })
    
    A memory leak was caused in the _CID repair function because it did
    not decrement the reference count created by the package. Fix the
    memory leak by calling acpi_ut_remove_reference on _CID package elements
    that represent a hardware ID (_HID).

    open: don't silently ignore unknown O-flags in openat2()
    
    [ Upstream commit cfe80306a0dd6d363934913e47c3f30d71b721e5 ]
    
    The new openat2() syscall verifies that no unknown O-flag values are
    set and returns an error to userspace if they are while the older open
    syscalls like open() and openat() simply ignore unknown flag values:
    
      #define O_FLAG_CURRENTLY_INVALID (1 << 31)
      struct open_how how = {
              .flags = O_RDONLY | O_FLAG_CURRENTLY_INVALID,
              .resolve = 0,
      };
    
      /* fails */
      fd = openat2(-EBADF, "/dev/null", &how, sizeof(how));
    
      /* succeeds */
      fd = openat(-EBADF, "/dev/null", O_RDONLY | O_FLAG_CURRENTLY_INVALID);
    
    However, openat2() silently truncates the upper 32 bits meaning:
    
      #define O_FLAG_CURRENTLY_INVALID_LOWER32 (1 << 31)
      #define O_FLAG_CURRENTLY_INVALID_UPPER32 (1 << 40)
    
      struct open_how how_lowe32 = {
              .flags = O_RDONLY | O_FLAG_CURRENTLY_INVALID_LOWER32,
      };
    
      struct open_how how_upper32 = {
              .flags = O_RDONLY | O_FLAG_CURRENTLY_INVALID_UPPER32,
      };
    
      /* fails */
      fd = openat2(-EBADF, "/dev/null", &how_lower32, sizeof(how_lower32));
    
      /* succeeds */
      fd = openat2(-EBADF, "/dev/null", &how_upper32, sizeof(how_upper32));
    
    Fix this by preventing the immediate truncation in build_open_flags().
    
    There's a snafu here though stripping FMODE_* directly from flags would
    cause the upper 32 bits to be truncated as well due to integer promotion
    rules since FMODE_* is unsigned int, O_* are signed ints (yuck).
    
    In addition, struct open_flags currently defines flags to be 32 bit
    which is reasonable. If we simply were to bump it to 64 bit we would
    need to change a lot of code preemptively which doesn't seem worth it.
    So simply add a compile-time check verifying that all currently known
    O_* flags are within the 32 bit range and fail to build if they aren't
    anymore.
    
    This change shouldn't regress old open syscalls since they silently
    truncate any unknown values anyway. It is a tiny semantic change for
    openat2() but it is very unlikely people pass ing > 32 bit unknown flags
    and the syscall is relatively new too.

    random32: Fix implicit truncation warning in prandom_seed_state()
    
    [ Upstream commit d327ea15a305024ef0085252fa3657bbb1ce25f5 ]
    
    sparse generates the following warning:
    
     include/linux/prandom.h:114:45: sparse: sparse: cast truncates bits from
     constant value
    
    This is because the 64-bit seed value is manipulated and then placed in a
    u32, causing an implicit cast and truncation. A forced cast to u32 doesn't
    prevent this warning, which is reasonable because a typecast doesn't prove
    that truncation was expected.
    
    Logical-AND the value with 0xffffffff to make explicit that truncation to
    32-bit is intended.

    flags as the original close_connection() was called.

    blk-mq: clear stale request in tags->rq[] before freeing one request pool
    
    [ Upstream commit bd63141d585bef14f4caf111f6d0e27fe2300ec6 ]
    
    refcount_inc_not_zero() in bt_tags_iter() still may read one freed
    request.
    
    Fix the issue by the following approach:
    
    1) hold a per-tags spinlock when reading ->rqs[tag] and calling
    refcount_inc_not_zero in bt_tags_iter()
    
    2) clearing stale request referred via ->rqs[tag] before freeing
    request pool, the per-tags spinlock is held for clearing stale
    ->rq[tag]
    
    So after we cleared stale requests, bt_tags_iter() won't observe
    freed request any more, also the clearing will wait for pending
    request reference.
    
    The idea of clearing ->rqs[] is borrowed from John Garry's previous
    patch and one recent David's patch.

    blk-mq: grab rq->refcount before calling ->fn in blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e315dc07df009c3e29d6926871f62a30cfae394 ]
    
    Grab rq->refcount before calling ->fn in blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter(), and
    this way will prevent the request from being re-used when ->fn is
    running. The approach is same as what we do during handling timeout.
    
    Fix request use-after-free(UAF) related with completion race or queue
    releasing:
    
    - If one rq is referred before rq->q is frozen, then queue won't be
    frozen before the request is released during iteration.
    
    - If one rq is referred after rq->q is frozen, refcount_inc_not_zero()
    will return false, and we won't iterate over this request.
    
    However, still one request UAF not covered: refcount_inc_not_zero() may
    read one freed request, and it will be handled in next patch.

    block_dump: remove block_dump feature in mark_inode_dirty()
    
    [ Upstream commit 12e0613715e1cf305fffafaf0e89d810d9a85cc0 ]
    
    block_dump is an old debugging interface, one of it's functions is used
    to print the information about who write which file on disk. If we
    enable block_dump through /proc/sys/vm/block_dump and turn on debug log
    level, we can gather information about write process name, target file
    name and disk from kernel message. This feature is realized in
    block_dump___mark_inode_dirty(), it print above information into kernel
    message directly when marking inode dirty, so it is noisy and can easily
    trigger log storm. At the same time, get the dentry refcount is also not
    safe, we found it will lead to deadlock on ext4 file system with
    data=journal mode.
    
    After tracepoints has been introduced into the kernel, we got a
    tracepoint in __mark_inode_dirty(), which is a better replacement of
    block_dump___mark_inode_dirty(). The only downside is that it only trace
    the inode number and not a file name, but it probably doesn't matter
    because the original printed file name in block_dump is not accurate in
    some cases, and we can still find it through the inode number and device
    id. So this patch delete the dirting inode part of block_dump feature.

    platform/x86: touchscreen_dmi: Add info for the Goodix GT912 panel of TM800A550L tablets
    
    [ Upstream commit fcd8cf0e3e48f4c66af82c8e799c37cb0cccffe0 ]
    
    The Bay Trail Glavey TM800A550L tablet, which ships with Android installed
    from the factory, uses a GT912 touchscreen controller which needs to have
    its firmware uploaded by the OS to work (this is a first for a x86 based
    device with a Goodix touchscreen controller).
    
    Add a touchscreen_dmi entry for this which specifies the filenames
    to use for the firmware and config files needed for this.
    
    Note this matches on a GDIX1001 ACPI HID, while the original DSDT uses
    a HID of GODX0911. For the touchscreen to work on these devices a DSDT
    override is necessary to fix a missing IRQ and broken GPIO settings in
    the ACPI-resources for the touchscreen. This override also changes the
    HID to the standard GDIX1001 id typically used for Goodix touchscreens.
    The DSDT override is available here:

    lib: vsprintf: Fix handling of number field widths in vsscanf
    
    [ Upstream commit 900fdc4573766dd43b847b4f54bd4a1ee2bc7360 ]
    
    The existing code attempted to handle numbers by doing a strto[u]l(),
    ignoring the field width, and then repeatedly dividing to extract the
    field out of the full converted value. If the string contains a run of
    valid digits longer than will fit in a long or long long, this would
    overflow and no amount of dividing can recover the correct value.
    
    This patch fixes vsscanf() to obey number field widths when parsing
    the number.
    
    A new _parse_integer_limit() is added that takes a limit for the number
    of characters to parse. The number field conversion in vsscanf is changed
    to use this new function.
    
    If a number starts with a radix prefix, the field width  must be long
    enough for at last one digit after the prefix. If not, it will be handled
    like this:
    
     sscanf("0x4", "%1i", &i): i=0, scanning continues with the 'x'
     sscanf("0x4", "%2i", &i): i=0, scanning continues with the '4'
    
    This is consistent with the observed behaviour of userland sscanf.
    
    Note that this patch does NOT fix the problem of a single field value
    overflowing the target type. So for example:
    
      sscanf("123456789abcdef", "%x", &i);
    
    Will not produce the correct result because the value obviously overflows
    INT_MAX. But sscanf will report a successful conversion.
    
    Note that where a very large number is used to mean "unlimited", the value
    INT_MAX is used for consistency with the behaviour of vsnprintf().

    ACPI: processor idle: Fix up C-state latency if not ordered
    
    [ Upstream commit 65ea8f2c6e230bdf71fed0137cf9e9d1b307db32 ]
    
    Generally, the C-state latency is provided by the _CST method or
    FADT, but some OEM platforms using AMD Picasso, Renoir, Van Gogh,
    and Cezanne set the C2 latency greater than C3's which causes the
    C2 state to be skipped.
    
    That will block the core entering PC6, which prevents S0ix working
    properly on Linux systems.
    
    In other operating systems, the latency values are not validated and
    this does not cause problems by skipping states.
    
    To avoid this issue on Linux, detect when latencies are not an
    arithmetic progression and sort them.

    ACPI: scan: Rearrange dep_unmet initialization
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d27975851b134be8d2a170437210c9719e524aa ]
    
    The dep_unmet field in struct acpi_device is used to store the
    number of unresolved _DEP dependencies (that is, operation region
    dependencies for which there are no drivers present) for the ACPI
    device object represented by it.
    
    That field is initialized to 1 for all ACPI device objects in
    acpi_add_single_object(), via acpi_init_device_object(), so as to
    avoid evaluating _STA prematurely for battery device objects in
    acpi_scan_init_status(), and it is "fixed up" in acpi_bus_check_add()
    after the acpi_add_single_object() called by it has returned.
    
    This is not particularly straightforward and causes dep_unmet to
    remain 1 for device objects without dependencies created by invoking
    acpi_add_single_object() directly, outside acpi_bus_check_add().
    
    For this reason, rearrange acpi_add_single_object() to initialize
    dep_unmet completely before calling acpi_scan_init_status(), which
    requires passing one extra bool argument to it, and update all of
    its callers accordingly.

    seccomp: Support atomic "addfd + send reply"
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ae71c7720e3ae3aabd2e8a072d27f7bd173d25c ]
    
    Alban Crequy reported a race condition userspace faces when we want to
    add some fds and make the syscall return them[1] using seccomp notify.
    
    The problem is that currently two different ioctl() calls are needed by
    the process handling the syscalls (agent) for another userspace process
    (target): SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_ADDFD to allocate the fd and
    SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_SEND to return that value. Therefore, it is possible
    for the agent to do the first ioctl to add a file descriptor but the
    target is interrupted (EINTR) before the agent does the second ioctl()
    call.
    
    This patch adds a flag to the ADDFD ioctl() so it adds the fd and
    returns that value atomically to the target program, as suggested by
    Kees Cook[2]. This is done by simply allowing
    seccomp_do_user_notification() to add the fd and return it in this case.
    Therefore, in this case the target wakes up from the wait in
    seccomp_do_user_notification() either to interrupt the syscall or to add
    the fd and return it.
    
    This "allocate an fd and return" functionality is useful for syscalls
    that return a file descriptor only, like connect(2). Other syscalls that
    return a file descriptor but not as return value (or return more than
    one fd), like socketpair(), pipe(), recvmsg with SCM_RIGHTs, will not
    work with this flag.
    
    This effectively combines SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_ADDFD and
    SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_SEND into an atomic opteration. The notification's
    return value, nor error can be set by the user. Upon successful invocation
    of the SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_ADDFD ioctl with the SECCOMP_ADDFD_FLAG_SEND
    flag, the notifying process's errno will be 0, and the return value will
    be the file descriptor number that was installed.

    media: Fix Media Controller API config checks
    
    [ Upstream commit 50e7a31d30e8221632675abed3be306382324ca2 ]
    
    Smatch static checker warns that "mdev" can be null:
    
    sound/usb/media.c:287 snd_media_device_create()
        warn: 'mdev' can also be NULL
    
    If CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER is disabled, this file should not be included
    in the build.
    
    The below conditions in the sound/usb/Makefile are in place to ensure that
    media.c isn't included in the build.
    
    sound/usb/Makefile:
    snd-usb-audio-$(CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO_USE_MEDIA_CONTROLLER) += media.o
    
    select SND_USB_AUDIO_USE_MEDIA_CONTROLLER if MEDIA_CONTROLLER &&
           (MEDIA_SUPPORT=y || MEDIA_SUPPORT=SND_USB_AUDIO)
    
    The following config check in include/media/media-dev-allocator.h is
    in place to enable the API only when CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER and
    CONFIG_USB are enabled.
    
     #if defined(CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER) && defined(CONFIG_USB)
    
    This check doesn't work as intended when CONFIG_USB=m. When CONFIG_USB=m,
    CONFIG_USB_MODULE is defined and CONFIG_USB is not. The above config check
    doesn't catch that CONFIG_USB is defined as a module and disables the API.
    This results in sound/usb enabling Media Controller specific ALSA driver
    code, while Media disables the Media Controller API.
    
    Fix the problem requires two changes:
    
    1. Change the check to use IS_ENABLED to detect when CONFIG_USB is enabled
       as a module or static. Since CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER is a bool, leave
       the check unchanged to be consistent with drivers/media/Makefile.
    
    2. Change the drivers/media/mc/Makefile to include mc-dev-allocator.o
       in mc-objs when CONFIG_USB is enabled.

    KVM: s390: get rid of register asm usage
    
    [ Upstream commit 4fa3b91bdee1b08348c82660668ca0ca34e271ad ]
    
    Using register asm statements has been proven to be very error prone,
    especially when using code instrumentation where gcc may add function
    calls, which clobbers register contents in an unexpected way.
    
    Therefore get rid of register asm statements in kvm code, even though
    there is currently nothing wrong with them. This way we know for sure
    that this bug class won't be introduced here.

    lockding/lockdep: Avoid to find wrong lock dep path in check_irq_usage()
    
    [ Upstream commit 7b1f8c6179769af6ffa055e1169610b51d71edd5 ]
    
    In the step #3 of check_irq_usage(), we seach backwards to find a lock
    whose usage conflicts the usage of @target_entry1 on safe/unsafe.
    However, we should only keep the irq-unsafe usage of @target_entry1 into
    consideration, because it could be a case where a lock is hardirq-unsafe
    but soft-safe, and in check_irq_usage() we find it because its
    hardirq-unsafe could result into a hardirq-safe-unsafe deadlock, but
    currently since we don't filter out the other usage bits, so we may find
    a lock dependency path softirq-unsafe -> softirq-safe, which in fact
    doesn't cause a deadlock. And this may cause misleading lockdep splats.
    
    Fix this by only keeping LOCKF_ENABLED_IRQ_ALL bits when we try the
    backwards search.

    [ Upstream commit 69c7a5fb2482636f525f016c8333fdb9111ecb9d ]
    
    We use the same code to print backwards lock dependency path as the

    btrfs: disable build on platforms having page size 256K
    
    [ Upstream commit b05fbcc36be1f8597a1febef4892053a0b2f3f60 ]
    
    With a config having PAGE_SIZE set to 256K, BTRFS build fails
    with the following message
    
      include/linux/compiler_types.h:326:38: error: call to
      '__compiletime_assert_791' declared with attribute error:
      BUILD_BUG_ON failed: (BTRFS_MAX_COMPRESSED % PAGE_SIZE) != 0
    
    BTRFS_MAX_COMPRESSED being 128K, BTRFS cannot support platforms with
    256K pages at the time being.
    
    There are two platforms that can select 256K pages:
     - hexagon
     - powerpc
    
    Disable BTRFS when 256K page size is selected. Supporting this would
    require changes to the subpage mode that's currently being developed.
    Given that 256K is many times larger than page sizes commonly used and
    for what the algorithms and structures have been tuned, it's out of
    scope and disabling build is a reasonable option.

    btrfs: don't clear page extent mapped if we're not invalidating the full page
    
    [ Upstream commit bcd77455d590eaa0422a5e84ae852007cfce574a ]
    
    [BUG]
    With current btrfs subpage rw support, the following script can lead to
    fs hang:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -f -s 4k $dev
      $ mount $dev -o nospace_cache $mnt
      $ fsstress -w -n 100 -p 1 -s 1608140256 -v -d $mnt
    
    The fs will hang at btrfs_start_ordered_extent().
    
    [CAUSE]
    In above test case, btrfs_invalidate() will be called with the following
    parameters:
    
      offset = 0 length = 53248 page dirty = 1 subpage dirty bitmap = 0x2000
    
    Since @offset is 0, btrfs_invalidate() will try to invalidate the full
    page, and finally call clear_page_extent_mapped() which will detach
    subpage structure from the page.
    
    And since the page no longer has subpage structure, the subpage dirty
    bitmap will be cleared, preventing the dirty range from being written
    back, thus no way to wake up the ordered extent.
    
    [FIX]
    Just follow other filesystems, only to invalidate the page if the range
    covers the full page.
    
    There are cases like truncate_setsize() which can call
    btrfs_invalidatepage() with offset == 0 and length != 0 for the last
    page of an inode.
    
    Although the old code will still try to invalidate the full page, we are
    still safe to just wait for ordered extent to finish.
    So it shouldn't cause extra problems.

    btrfs: always abort the transaction if we abort a trans handle
    
    [ Upstream commit 5963ffcaf383134985a5a2d8a4baa582d3999e0a ]
    
    While stress testing our error handling I noticed that sometimes we
    would still commit the transaction even though we had aborted the
    transaction.
    
    Currently we track if a trans handle has dirtied any metadata, and if it
    hasn't we mark the filesystem as having an error (so no new transactions
    can be started), but we will allow the current transaction to complete
    as we do not mark the transaction itself as having been aborted.
    
    This sounds good in theory, but we were not properly tracking IO errors
    in btrfs_finish_ordered_io, and thus committing the transaction with
    bogus free space data.  This isn't necessarily a problem per-se with the
    free space cache, as the other guards in place would have kept us from
    accepting the free space cache as valid, but highlights a real world
    case where we had a bug and could have corrupted the filesystem because
    of it.
    
    This "skip abort on empty trans handle" is nice in theory, but assumes
    we have perfect error handling everywhere, which we clearly do not.
    Also we do not allow further transactions to be started, so all this
    does is save the last transaction that was happening, which doesn't
    necessarily gain us anything other than the potential for real
    corruption.
    
    Remove this particular bit of code, if we decide we need to abort the
    transaction then abort the current one and keep us from doing real harm
    to the file system, regardless of whether this specific trans handle
    dirtied anything or not.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix TLB management on SMT8 POWER9 and POWER10 processors
    
    [ Upstream commit 77bbbc0cf84834ed130838f7ac1988567f4d0288 ]
    
    The POWER9 vCPU TLB management code assumes all threads in a core share
    a TLB, and that TLBIEL execued by one thread will invalidate TLBs for
    all threads. This is not the case for SMT8 capable POWER9 and POWER10
    (big core) processors, where the TLB is split between groups of threads.
    This results in TLB multi-hits, random data corruption, etc.
    
    Fix this by introducing cpu_first_tlb_thread_sibling etc., to determine

    KVM: arm64: Restore PMU configuration on first run
    
    [ Upstream commit d0c94c49792cf780cbfefe29f81bb8c3b73bc76b ]
    
    Restoring a guest with an active virtual PMU results in no perf
    counters being instanciated on the host side. Not quite what
    you'd expect from a restore.
    
    In order to fix this, force a writeback of PMCR_EL0 on the first
    run of a vcpu (using a new request so that it happens once the
    vcpu has been loaded). This will in turn create all the host-side
    counters that were missing.

    perf/x86: Reset the dirty counter to prevent the leak for an RDPMC task
    
    [ Upstream commit 5471eea5d3bf850316f1064a6f57b34c444bce67 ]
    
    The counter value of a perf task may leak to another RDPMC task.
    For example, a perf stat task as below is running on CPU 0.
    
        perf stat -e 'branches,cycles' -- taskset -c 0 ./workload
    
    In the meantime, an RDPMC task, which is also running on CPU 0, may read
    the GP counters periodically. (The RDPMC task creates a fixed event,
    but read four GP counters.)
    
        $./rdpmc_read_all_counters
        index 0x0 value 0x8001e5970f99
        index 0x1 value 0x8005d750edb6
        index 0x2 value 0x0
        index 0x3 value 0x0
    
        index 0x0 value 0x8002358e48a5
        index 0x1 value 0x8006bd1e3bc9
        index 0x2 value 0x0
        index 0x3 value 0x0
    
    It is a potential security issue. Once the attacker knows what the other
    thread is counting. The PerfMon counter can be used as a side-channel to
    attack cryptosystems.
    
    The counter value of the perf stat task leaks to the RDPMC task because
    perf never clears the counter when it's stopped.
    
    Three methods were considered to address the issue.
    
     - Unconditionally reset the counter in x86_pmu_del(). It can bring extra
       overhead even when there is no RDPMC task running.
    
     - Only reset the un-assigned dirty counters when the RDPMC task is
       scheduled in via sched_task(). It fails for the below case.
    
            Thread A                        Thread B
    
            clone(CLONE_THREAD) --->
            set_affine(0)
                                            set_affine(1)
                                            while (!event-enabled)
                                                    ;
            event = perf_event_open()
            mmap(event)
            ioctl(event, IOC_ENABLE); --->
                                            RDPMC
    
       Counters are still leaked to the thread B.
    
     - Only reset the un-assigned dirty counters before updating the CR4.PCE
       bit. The method is implemented here.
    
    The dirty counter is a counter, on which the assigned event has been
    deleted, but the counter is not reset. To track the dirty counters,
    add a 'dirty' variable in the struct cpu_hw_events.
    
    The security issue can only be found with an RDPMC task. To enable the
    RDMPC, the CR4.PCE bit has to be updated. Add a
    perf_clear_dirty_counters() right before updating the CR4.PCE bit to
    clear the existing dirty counters. Only the current un-assigned dirty
    counters are reset, because the RDPMC assigned dirty counters will be
    updated soon.
    
    After applying the patch,
    
            $ ./rdpmc_read_all_counters
            index 0x0 value 0x0
            index 0x1 value 0x0
            index 0x2 value 0x0
            index 0x3 value 0x0
    
            index 0x0 value 0x0
            index 0x1 value 0x0
            index 0x2 value 0x0
            index 0x3 value 0x0
    
    Performance
    
    The performance of a context switch only be impacted when there are two
    or more perf users and one of the users must be an RDPMC user. In other
    cases, there is no performance impact.
    
    The worst-case occurs when there are two users: the RDPMC user only
    uses one counter; while the other user uses all available counters.
    When the RDPMC task is scheduled in, all the counters, other than the
    RDPMC assigned one, have to be reset.
    
    Test results for the worst-case, using a modified lat_ctx as measured
    on an Ice Lake platform, which has 8 GP and 3 FP counters (ignoring
    SLOTS).
    
        lat_ctx -s 128K -N 1000 processes 2
    
    Without the patch:
      The context switch time is 4.97 us
    
    With the patch:
      The context switch time is 5.16 us
    
    There is ~4% performance drop for the context switching time in the
    worst-case.

    sched/fair: Take thermal pressure into account while estimating energy
    
    [ Upstream commit 489f16459e0008c7a5c4c5af34bd80898aa82c2d ]
    
    Energy Aware Scheduling (EAS) needs to be able to predict the frequency
    requests made by the SchedUtil governor to properly estimate energy used
    in the future. It has to take into account CPUs utilization and forecast
    Performance Domain (PD) frequency. There is a corner case when the max
    allowed frequency might be reduced due to thermal. SchedUtil is aware of
    that reduced frequency, so it should be taken into account also in EAS
    estimations.
    
    SchedUtil, as a CPUFreq governor, knows the maximum allowed frequency of
    a CPU, thanks to cpufreq_driver_resolve_freq() and internal clamping
    to 'policy::max'. SchedUtil is responsible to respect that upper limit
    while setting the frequency through CPUFreq drivers. This effective
    frequency is stored internally in 'sugov_policy::next_freq' and EAS has
    to predict that value.
    
    In the existing code the raw value of arch_scale_cpu_capacity() is used
    for clamping the returned CPU utilization from effective_cpu_util().
    This patch fixes issue with too big single CPU utilization, by introducing
    clamping to the allowed CPU capacity. The allowed CPU capacity is a CPU
    capacity reduced by thermal pressure raw value.
    
    Thanks to knowledge about allowed CPU capacity, we don't get too big value
    for a single CPU utilization, which is then added to the util sum. The
    util sum is used as a source of information for estimating whole PD energy.
    To avoid wrong energy estimation in EAS (due to capped frequency), make
    sure that the calculation of util sum is aware of allowed CPU capacity.
    
    This thermal pressure might be visible in scenarios where the CPUs are not
    heavily loaded, but some other component (like GPU) drastically reduced
    available power budget and increased the SoC temperature. Thus, we still
    use EAS for task placement and CPUs are not over-utilized.

    hwmon: (max31790) Fix pwmX_enable attributes
    
    [ Upstream commit 148c847c9e5a54b99850617bf9c143af9a344f92 ]
    
    pwmX_enable supports three possible values:
    
    0: Fan control disabled. Duty cycle is fixed to 0%
    1: Fan control enabled, pwm mode. Duty cycle is determined by
       values written into Target Duty Cycle registers.
    2: Fan control enabled, rpm mode
       Duty cycle is adjusted such that fan speed matches
       the values in Target Count registers
    
    The current code does not do this; instead, it mixes pwm control
    configuration with fan speed monitoring configuration. Worse, it
    reports that pwm control would be disabled (pwmX_enable==0) when
    it is in fact enabled in pwm mode. Part of the problem may be that
    the chip sets the "TACH input enable" bit on its own whenever the
    mode bit is set to RPM mode, but that doesn't mean that "TACH input
    enable" accurately reflects the pwm mode.
    
    Fix it up and only handle pwm control with the pwmX_enable attributes.
    In the documentation, clarify that disabling pwm control (pwmX_enable=0)
    sets the pwm duty cycle to 0%. In the code, explain why TACH_INPUT_EN
    is set together with RPM_MODE.
    
    While at it, only update the configuration register if the configuration
    has changed, and only update the cached configuration if updating the
    chip configuration was successful.

    hwmon: (max31790) Report correct current pwm duty cycles
    
    [ Upstream commit 897f6339893b741a5d68ae8e2475df65946041c2 ]
    
    The MAX31790 has two sets of registers for pwm duty cycles, one to request
    a duty cycle and one to read the actual current duty cycle. Both do not
    have to be the same.
    
    When reporting the pwm duty cycle to the user, the actual pwm duty cycle
    from pwm duty cycle registers needs to be reported. When setting it, the
    pwm target duty cycle needs to be written. Since we don't know the actual
    pwm duty cycle after a target pwm duty cycle has been written, set the
    valid flag to false to indicate that actual pwm duty cycle should be read
    from the chip instead of using cached values.

    crypto: shash - avoid comparing pointers to exported functions under CFI
    
    [ Upstream commit 22ca9f4aaf431a9413dcc115dd590123307f274f ]
    
    crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey() is implemented by testing whether the
    .setkey() member of a struct shash_alg points to the default version,
    called shash_no_setkey(). As crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey() is a static
    inline, this requires shash_no_setkey() to be exported to modules.
    
    Unfortunately, when building with CFI, function pointers are routed
    via CFI stubs which are private to each module (or to the kernel proper)
    and so this function pointer comparison may fail spuriously.
    
    Let's fix this by turning crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey() into an out of
    line function.

    In meson_spifc_probe function, when enable the device pclk clock is
    error, it should use clk_disable_unprepare to release the core clock.

    mmc: sdhci-of-aspeed: Turn down a phase correction warning
    
    [ Upstream commit a7ab186f60785850b5af1be183867000485ad491 ]
    
    The card timing and the bus frequency are not changed atomically with
    respect to calls to the set_clock() callback in the driver. The result
    is the driver sees a transient state where there's a mismatch between
    the two and thus the inputs to the phase correction calculation
    formula are garbage.
    
    Switch from dev_warn() to dev_dbg() to avoid noise in the normal case,
    though the change does make bad configurations less likely to be
    noticed.

    mmc: via-sdmmc: add a check against NULL pointer dereference
    
    [ Upstream commit 45c8ddd06c4b729c56a6083ab311bfbd9643f4a6 ]
    
    Before referencing 'host->data', the driver needs to check whether it is
    null pointer, otherwise it will cause a null pointer reference.
    
    This log reveals it:

    This patch fixes the following issues:
    1. memstick_free_host() will free the host, so the use of ms_dev(host) after
    it will be a problem. To fix this, move memstick_free_host() after when we
    are done with ms_dev(host).
    2. In rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove(), pm need to be disabled before we remove
    and free host otherwise memstick_check will be called and UAF will
    happen.

    media: dvd_usb: memory leak in cinergyt2_fe_attach
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ad1efee086e0e913914fa2b2173efb830bad68c ]
    
    When the driver fails to talk with the hardware with dvb_usb_generic_rw,
    it will return an error to dvb_usb_adapter_frontend_init. However, the
    driver forgets to free the resource (e.g., struct cinergyt2_fe_state),
    which leads to a memory leak.
    
    Fix this by freeing struct cinergyt2_fe_state when dvb_usb_generic_rw
    fails in cinergyt2_frontend_attach.

    Makefile: fix GDB warning with CONFIG_RELR
    
    [ Upstream commit 27f2a4db76e8d8a8b601fc1c6a7a17f88bd907ab ]
    
    GDB produces the following warning when debugging kernels built with
    CONFIG_RELR:
    
    BFD: /android0/linux-next/vmlinux: unknown type [0x13] section `.relr.dyn'
    
    when loading a kernel built with CONFIG_RELR into GDB. It can also
    prevent debugging symbols using such relocations.
    
    Peter sugguests:
      [That flag] means that lld will use dynamic tags and section type
      numbers in the OS-specific range rather than the generic range. The
      kernel itself doesn't care about these numbers; it determines the
      location of the RELR section using symbols defined by a linker script.

    arm64: entry: don't instrument entry code with KCOV
    
    [ Upstream commit bf6fa2c0dda751863c3446aa64d733013bec4a19 ]
    
    The code in entry-common.c runs at exception entry and return
    boundaries, where portions of the kernel environment aren't available.
    For example, RCU may not be watching, and lockdep state may be
    out-of-sync with the hardware. Due to this, it is not sound to
    instrument this code.
    
    We generally avoid instrumentation by marking the entry functions as
    `noinstr`, but currently this doesn't inhibit KCOV instrumentation.
    Prevent this by disabling KCOV for the entire compilation unit.

    When ctx_id >= HVA_MAX_INSTANCES in hva_hw_its_irq_thread() it tries to
    access fields of ctx that is NULL at that point. The patch gets rid of

    media: bt8xx: Fix a missing check bug in bt878_probe
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a4520090681853e6b850cbe54b27247a013e0e5 ]
    
    In 'bt878_irq', the driver calls 'tasklet_schedule', but this tasklet is
    set in 'dvb_bt8xx_load_card' of another driver 'dvb-bt8xx'.
    However, this two drivers are separate. The user may not load the
    'dvb-bt8xx' driver when loading the 'bt8xx' driver, that is, the tasklet
    has not been initialized when 'tasklet_schedule' is called, so it is
    necessary to check whether the tasklet is initialized in 'bt878_probe'.
    
    Fix this by adding a check at the end of bt878_probe.

    There is a problem with the tasklet in bt878. bt->tasklet is set by
    dvb-bt8xx.ko, and bt878.ko can be loaded independently.
    In this case if interrupt comes it may cause null-ptr-dereference.
    To solve this issue, we check if the tasklet is actually set before
    calling tasklet_schedule.

    On some platform(imx6q), xvclk might not switch on in advance,
    also for power save purpose, xvclk should not be always on.
    so, add clk_prepare_enable(), clk_disable_unprepare() in driver
    side to set xvclk on/off at proper stage.
    
    Add following changes:
    - add 'struct clk *clk;' in 'struct ov2659 {}'
    - enable xvclk in ov2659_power_on()
    - disable xvclk in ov2659_power_off()

    arm64: perf: Convert snprintf to sysfs_emit
    
    [ Upstream commit a5740e955540181f4ab8f076cc9795c6bbe4d730 ]
    
    Use sysfs_emit instead of snprintf to avoid buf overrun,because in
    sysfs_emit it strictly checks whether buf is null or buf whether
    pagesize aligned, otherwise it returns an error.

            sysfs group 'power' not found for kobject '1-0043'
    
    When the device is disconnected (pvr_hdw_disconnect), the i2c adapter is
    not unregistered along with the USB and v4l2 teardown. As part of the USB
    device disconnect, the sysfs files of the subdevices are also deleted.
    So, by the time pvr_i2c_core_done is called by pvr_context_destroy, the
    sysfs files have been deleted.
    
    To fix this, unregister the i2c adapter too in pvr_hdw_disconnect. Make
    the device deregistration code shared by calling pvr_hdw_disconnect from
    pvr2_hdw_destroy.

    sched: Make the idle task quack like a per-CPU kthread
    
    [ Upstream commit 00b89fe0197f0c55a045775c11553c0cdb7082fe ]
    
    For all intents and purposes, the idle task is a per-CPU kthread. It isn't
    created via the same route as other pcpu kthreads however, and as a result
    it is missing a few bells and whistles: it fails kthread_is_per_cpu() and
    it doesn't have PF_NO_SETAFFINITY set.
    
    Fix the former by giving the idle task a kthread struct along with the
    KTHREAD_IS_PER_CPU flag. This requires some extra iffery as init_idle()
    call be called more than once on the same idle task.

    sched/core: Initialize the idle task with preemption disabled
    
    [ Upstream commit f1a0a376ca0c4ef1fc3d24e3e502acbb5b795674 ]
    
    As pointed out by commit
    
      de9b8f5dcbd9 ("sched: Fix crash trying to dequeue/enqueue the idle thread")
    
    init_idle() can and will be invoked more than once on the same idle
    task. At boot time, it is invoked for the boot CPU thread by
    sched_init(). Then smp_init() creates the threads for all the secondary
    CPUs and invokes init_idle() on them.
    
    As the hotplug machinery brings the secondaries to life, it will issue
    calls to idle_thread_get(), which itself invokes init_idle() yet again.
    In this case it's invoked twice more per secondary: at _cpu_up(), and at
    bringup_cpu().
    
    Given smp_init() already initializes the idle tasks for all *possible*
    CPUs, no further initialization should be required. Now, removing
    init_idle() from idle_thread_get() exposes some interesting expectations
    with regards to the idle task's preempt_count: the secondary startup always
    issues a preempt_disable(), requiring some reset of the preempt count to 0
    between hot-unplug and hotplug, which is currently served by
    idle_thread_get() -> idle_init().
    
    Given the idle task is supposed to have preemption disabled once and never
    see it re-enabled, it seems that what we actually want is to initialize its
    preempt_count to PREEMPT_DISABLED and leave it there. Do that, and remove
    init_idle() from idle_thread_get().
    
    Secondary startups were patched via coccinelle:

    [ Upstream commit 908711f542c17fe61e5d653da1beb8e5ab5c7b50 ]
    
    Currently, the driver just assumes that PM runtime logic
    succeded resuming the device.
    
    That may not be the case, as pm_runtime_get_sync()
    can fail (but keeping the usage count incremented).
    
    Replace the code to use pm_runtime_resume_and_get(),
    and letting it return the error code.
    
    This way, if mtk_vcodec_dec_pw_on() fails, the logic
    under fops_vcodec_open() will do the right thing and
    return an error, instead of just assuming that the
    device is ready to be used.

    [ Upstream commit 62c90446868b439929cb04395f04a709a64ae04b ]
    
    The PM runtime get logic is currently broken, as it checks if
    ret is zero instead of checking if it is an error code,
    as reported by Dan Carpenter.
    
    While here, use the pm_runtime_resume_and_get() as added by:
    commit dd8088d5a896 ("PM: runtime: Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter")
    added pm_runtime_resume_and_get() in order to automatically handle
    dev->power.usage_count decrement on errors. As a bonus, such function
    always return zero on success.
    
    It should also be noticed that a fail of pm_runtime_get_sync() would
    potentially result in a spurious runtime_suspend(), instead of
    using pm_runtime_put_noidle().

    Add a reference to ucounts for each cred
    
    [ Upstream commit 905ae01c4ae2ae3df05bb141801b1db4b7d83c61 ]
    
    For RLIMIT_NPROC and some other rlimits the user_struct that holds the
    global limit is kept alive for the lifetime of a process by keeping it
    in struct cred. Adding a pointer to ucounts in the struct cred will
    allow to track RLIMIT_NPROC not only for user in the system, but for
    user in the user_namespace.
    
    Updating ucounts may require memory allocation which may fail. So, we
    cannot change cred.ucounts in the commit_creds() because this function
    cannot fail and it should always return 0. For this reason, we modify
    cred.ucounts before calling the commit_creds().

    * Fix null-ptr-deref in is_ucounts_overlimit() detected by trinity. This

    spi: Make of_register_spi_device also set the fwnode
    
    [ Upstream commit 0e793ba77c18382f08e440260fe72bc6fce2a3cb ]
    
    Currently, the SPI core doesn't set the struct device fwnode pointer
    when it creates a new SPI device. This means when the device is
    registered the fwnode is NULL and the check in device_add which sets
    the fwnode->dev pointer is skipped. This wasn't previously an issue,
    however these two patches:
    
    commit 4731210c09f5 ("gpiolib: Bind gpio_device to a driver to enable
    fw_devlink=on by default")
    commit ced2af419528 ("gpiolib: Don't probe gpio_device if it's not the
    primary device")
    
    Added some code to the GPIO core which relies on using that
    fwnode->dev pointer to determine if a driver is bound to the fwnode
    and if not bind a stub GPIO driver. This means the GPIO providers
    behind SPI will get both the expected driver and this stub driver
    causing the stub driver to fail if it attempts to request any pin
    configuration. For example on my system:
    
    madera-pinctrl madera-pinctrl: pin gpio5 already requested by madera-pinctrl; cannot claim for gpiochip3
    madera-pinctrl madera-pinctrl: pin-4 (gpiochip3) status -22
    madera-pinctrl madera-pinctrl: could not request pin 4 (gpio5) from group aif1  on device madera-pinctrl
    gpio_stub_drv gpiochip3: Error applying setting, reverse things back
    gpio_stub_drv: probe of gpiochip3 failed with error -22
    
    The firmware node on the device created by the GPIO framework is set
    through the of_node pointer hence things generally actually work,
    however that fwnode->dev is never set, as the check was skipped at
    device_add time. This fix appears to match how the I2C subsystem
    handles the same situation.

    thermal/cpufreq_cooling: Update offline CPUs per-cpu thermal_pressure
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ad8ccc17d1e4270cf65a3f2a07a7534aa23e3fb ]
    
    The thermal pressure signal gives information to the scheduler about
    reduced CPU capacity due to thermal. It is based on a value stored in
    a per-cpu 'thermal_pressure' variable. The online CPUs will get the
    new value there, while the offline won't. Unfortunately, when the CPU
    is back online, the value read from per-cpu variable might be wrong
    (stale data).  This might affect the scheduler decisions, since it
    sees the CPU capacity differently than what is actually available.
    
    Fix it by making sure that all online+offline CPUs would get the
    proper value in their per-cpu variable when thermal framework sets
    capping.

    fuse: check connected before queueing on fpq->io
    
    commit 80ef08670d4c28a06a3de954bd350368780bcfef upstream.
    
    A request could end up on the fpq->io list after fuse_abort_conn() has

    Thread-1                          Thread-2

      ->acquire(fpq->lock)
      ->add req to fpq->io
    
    After the userspace copy is done the request will be ended, but
    req->out.h.error will remain uninitialized.  Also the copy might block
    despite being already aborted.
    
    Fix both issues by not allowing the request to be queued on the fpq->io
    list after fuse_abort_conn() has processed this list.

    fuse: ignore PG_workingset after stealing
    
    commit b89ecd60d38ec042d63bdb376c722a16f92bcb88 upstream.
    
    Fix the "fuse: trying to steal weird page" warning.
    
    Description from Johannes Weiner:
    
      "Think of it as similar to PG_active. It's just another usage/heat
       indicator of file and anon pages on the reclaim LRU that, unlike
       PG_active, persists across deactivation and even reclaim (we store it in
       the page cache / swapper cache tree until the page refaults).
    
       So if fuse accepts pages that can legally have PG_active set,
       PG_workingset is fine too."

    fuse: Fix infinite loop in sget_fc()
    
    commit e4a9ccdd1c03b3dc58214874399d24331ea0a3ab upstream.
    
    We don't set the SB_BORN flag on submounts. This is wrong as these
    superblocks are then considered as partially constructed or dying
    in the rest of the code and can break some assumptions.
    
    One such case is when you have a virtiofs filesystem with submounts
    and you try to mount it again : virtio_fs_get_tree() tries to obtain
    a superblock with sget_fc(). The logic in sget_fc() is to loop until
    it has either found an existing matching superblock with SB_BORN set
    or to create a brand new one. It is assumed that a superblock without
    SB_BORN is transient and the loop is restarted. Forgetting to set
    SB_BORN on submounts hence causes sget_fc() to retry forever.
    
    Setting SB_BORN requires special care, i.e. a write barrier for
    super_cache_count() which can check SB_BORN without taking any lock.
    We should call vfs_get_tree() to deal with that but this requires
    to have a proper ->get_tree() implementation for submounts, which
    is a bigger piece of work. Go for a simple bug fix in the meatime.

    fuse: Fix crash if superblock of submount gets killed early
    
    commit e3a43f2a95393000778f8f302d48795add2fc4a8 upstream.
    
    As soon as fuse_dentry_automount() does up_write(&sb->s_umount), the
    superblock can theoretically be killed. If this happens before the
    submount was added to the &fc->mounts list, fuse_mount_remove() later
    crashes in list_del_init() because it assumes the submount to be
    already there.
    
    Add the submount before dropping sb->s_umount to fix the inconsistency.
    It is okay to nest fc->killsb under sb->s_umount, we already do this
    on the ->kill_sb() path.

    fuse: Fix crash in fuse_dentry_automount() error path
    
    commit d92d88f0568e97c437eeb79d9c9609bd8277406f upstream.
    
    If fuse_fill_super_submount() returns an error, the error path
    triggers a crash:
    
    [   26.206673] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000

    [   26.250077]  fuse_dentry_automount+0x178/0x1a0 [fuse]
    
    The crash happens because fuse_mount_remove() assumes that the FUSE
    mount was already added to list under the FUSE connection, but this
    only done after fuse_fill_super_submount() has returned success.
    
    This means that until fuse_fill_super_submount() has returned success,
    the FUSE mount isn't actually owned by the superblock. We should thus
    reclaim ownership by clearing sb->s_fs_info, which will skip the call
    to fuse_mount_remove(), and perform rollback, like virtio_fs_get_tree()
    already does for the root sb.

    evm: Refuse EVM_ALLOW_METADATA_WRITES only if an HMAC key is loaded
    
    commit 9acc89d31f0c94c8e573ed61f3e4340bbd526d0c upstream.
    
    EVM_ALLOW_METADATA_WRITES is an EVM initialization flag that can be set to
    temporarily disable metadata verification until all xattrs/attrs necessary
    to verify an EVM portable signature are copied to the file. This flag is
    cleared when EVM is initialized with an HMAC key, to avoid that the HMAC is
    calculated on unverified xattrs/attrs.
    
    Currently EVM unnecessarily denies setting this flag if EVM is initialized
    with a public key, which is not a concern as it cannot be used to trust
    xattrs/attrs updates. This patch removes this limitation.

    evm: Execute evm_inode_init_security() only when an HMAC key is loaded
    
    commit 9eea2904292c2d8fa98df141d3bf7c41ec9dc1b5 upstream.
    
    evm_inode_init_security() requires an HMAC key to calculate the HMAC on
    initial xattrs provided by LSMs. However, it checks generically whether a
    key has been loaded, including also public keys, which is not correct as
    public keys are not suitable to calculate the HMAC.
    
    Originally, support for signature verification was introduced to verify a
    possibly immutable initial ram disk, when no new files are created, and to
    switch to HMAC for the root filesystem. By that time, an HMAC key should
    have been loaded and usable to calculate HMACs for new files.
    
    More recently support for requiring an HMAC key was removed from the
    kernel, so that signature verification can be used alone. Since this is a
    legitimate use case, evm_inode_init_security() should not return an error
    when no HMAC key has been loaded.
    
    This patch fixes this problem by replacing the evm_key_loaded() check with
    a check of the EVM_INIT_HMAC flag in evm_initialized.

    the X86_FEATURE_HYBRID_CPU is not set. The number of the GP counters and

    powerpc/stacktrace: Fix spurious "stale" traces in raise_backtrace_ipi()
    
    commit 7c6986ade69e3c81bac831645bc72109cd798a80 upstream.
    
    In raise_backtrace_ipi() we iterate through the cpumask of CPUs, sending
    each an IPI asking them to do a backtrace, but we don't wait for the
    backtrace to happen.
    
    We then iterate through the CPU mask again, and if any CPU hasn't done
    the backtrace and cleared itself from the mask, we print a trace on its
    behalf, noting that the trace may be "stale".
    
    This works well enough when a CPU is not responding, because in that
    case it doesn't receive the IPI and the sending CPU is left to print the
    trace. But when all CPUs are responding we are left with a race between
    the sending and receiving CPUs, if the sending CPU wins the race then it
    will erroneously print a trace.
    
    This leads to spurious "stale" traces from the sending CPU, which can
    then be interleaved messily with the receiving CPU, note the CPU
    numbers, eg:
    
      [ 1658.929157][    C7] rcu: Stack dump where RCU GP kthread last ran:
      [ 1658.929223][    C7] Sending NMI from CPU 7 to CPUs 1:
      [ 1658.929303][    C1] NMI backtrace for cpu 1
      [ 1658.929303][    C7] CPU 1 didn't respond to backtrace IPI, inspecting paca.
      [ 1658.929362][    C1] CPU: 1 PID: 325 Comm: kworker/1:1H Tainted: G        W   E     5.13.0-rc2+ #46
      [ 1658.929405][    C7] irq_soft_mask: 0x01 in_mce: 0 in_nmi: 0 current: 325 (kworker/1:1H)
      [ 1658.929465][    C1] Workqueue: events_highpri test_work_fn [test_lockup]
      [ 1658.929549][    C7] Back trace of paca->saved_r1 (0xc0000000057fb400) (possibly stale):
      [ 1658.929592][    C1] NIP:  c00000000002cf50 LR: c008000000820178 CTR: c00000000002cfa0
    
    To fix it, change the logic so that the sending CPU waits 5s for the
    receiving CPU to print its trace. If the receiving CPU prints its trace
    successfully then the sending CPU just continues, avoiding any spurious
    "stale" trace.
    
    This has the added benefit of allowing all CPUs to print their traces in
    order and avoids any interleaving of their output.

    seq_buf: Make trace_seq_putmem_hex() support data longer than 8
    
    commit 6a2cbc58d6c9d90cd74288cc497c2b45815bc064 upstream.
    
    Since the raw memory 'data' does not go forward, it will dump repeated
    data if the data length is more than 8. If we want to dump longer data
    blocks, we need to repeatedly call macro SEQ_PUT_HEX_FIELD. I think it
    is a bit redundant, and multiple function calls also affect the performance.

    commit 9913d5745bd720c4266805c8d29952a3702e4eca upstream.
    
    All internal use cases for tracepoint_probe_register() is set to not ever
    be called with the same function and data. If it is, it is considered a

    If the function and data for a tracepoint is already registered when
    tracepoint_probe_register() is called, it will call WARN_ON_ONCE() and
    return with EEXISTS.
    
    The BPF system call can end up calling tracepoint_probe_register() with
    the same data, which now means that this can trigger the warning because
    of a user space process. As WARN_ON_ONCE() should not be called because
    user space called a system call with bad data, there needs to be a way to
    register a tracepoint without triggering a warning.
    
    Enter tracepoint_probe_register_may_exist(), which can be called, but will
    not cause a WARN_ON() if the probe already exists. It will still error out
    with EEXIST, which will then be sent to the user space that performed the
    BPF system call.
    
    This keeps the previous testing for issues with other users of the
    tracepoint code, while letting BPF call it with duplicated data and not
    warn about it.

    tracing/histograms: Fix parsing of "sym-offset" modifier
    
    commit 26c563731056c3ee66f91106c3078a8c36bb7a9e upstream.
    
    With the addition of simple mathematical operations (plus and minus), the
    parsing of the "sym-offset" modifier broke, as it took the '-' part of the
    "sym-offset" as a minus, and tried to break it up into a mathematical
    operation of "field.sym - offset", in which case it failed to parse
    (unless the event had a field called "offset").
    
    Both .sym and .sym-offset modifiers should not be entered into
    mathematical calculations anyway. If ".sym-offset" is found in the
    modifier, then simply make it not an operation that can be calculated on.

    selftests/resctrl: Fix incorrect parsing of option "-t"
    
    commit 1421ec684a43379b2aa3cfda20b03d38282dc990 upstream.
    
    Resctrl test suite accepts command line argument "-t" to specify the
    unit tests to run in the test list (e.g., -t mbm,mba,cmt,cat) as
    documented in the help.
    
    When calling strtok() to parse the option, the incorrect delimiters
    argument ":\t" is used. As a result, passing "-t mbm,mba,cmt,cat" throws
    an invalid option error.
    
    Fix this by using delimiters argument "," instead of ":\t" for parsing
    of unit tests list. At the same time, remove the unnecessary "spaces"
    between the unit tests in help documentation to prevent confusion.

    rsi: fix AP mode with WPA failure due to encrypted EAPOL
    
    commit 314538041b5632ffaf64798faaeabaf2793fe029 upstream.
    
    In AP mode WPA2-PSK connections were not established.
    
    The reason was that the AP was sending the first message
    of the 4 way handshake encrypted, even though no pairwise
    key had (correctly) yet been set.
    
    Encryption was enabled if the "security_enable" driver flag
    was set and encryption was not explicitly disabled by
    IEEE80211_TX_INTFL_DONT_ENCRYPT.
    
    However security_enable was set when *any* key, including
    the AP GTK key, had been set which was causing unwanted
    encryption even if no key was avaialble for the unicast
    packet to be sent.
    
    Fix this by adding a check that we have a key and drop
    the old security_enable driver flag which is insufficient
    and redundant.
    
    The Redpine downstream out of tree driver does it this way too.
    
    Regarding the Fixes tag the actual code being modified was
    introduced earlier, with the original driver submission, in
    dad0d04fa7ba ("rsi: Add RS9113 wireless driver"), however
    at that time AP mode was not yet supported so there was
    no bug at that point.
    
    So I have tagged the introduction of AP support instead
    which was part of the patch set "rsi: support for AP mode" [1]
    
    It is not clear whether AP WPA has ever worked, I can see nothing
    on the kernel side that broke it afterwards yet the AP support
    patch series says "Tests are performed to confirm aggregation,
    connections in WEP and WPA/WPA2 security."
    
    One possibility is that the initial tests were done with a modified
    userspace (hostapd).

    commit b1c3a24897bd528f2f4fda9fea7da08a84ae25b6 upstream.
    
    The RSI_RATE_x bits must be assigned to struct rsi_data_desc rate_info
    field. The rest of the driver does it correctly, except this one place,
    so fix it. This is also aligned with the RSI downstream vendor driver.
    Without this patch, an AP operating at 5 GHz does not transmit any
    beacons at all, this patch fixes that.

    ath9k: Fix kernel NULL pointer dereference during ath_reset_internal()
    
    commit fb312ac5ccb007e843f982b38d4d6886ba4b32f2 upstream.
    
    I got this crash more times during debugging of PCIe controller and crash
    happens somehow at the time when PCIe kernel code started link retraining (as
    part of ASPM code) when at the same time PCIe link went down and ath9k probably
    executed hw reset procedure.
    
    Currently I'm not able to reproduce this issue as it looks like to be
    some race condition between link training, ASPM, link down and reset
    path. And as always, race conditions which depends on more input
    parameters are hard to reproduce as it depends on precise timings.
    
    But it is clear that pointers are zero in this case and should be
    properly filled as same code pattern is used in ath9k_stop() function.
    Anyway I was able to reproduce this crash by manually triggering ath
    reset worker prior putting card up. I created simple patch to export
    reset functionality via debugfs and use it to "simulate" of triggering
    reset.    s proved that NULL-pointer dereference issue is there.
    
    Function ath9k_hw_reset() is dereferencing chan structure pointer, so it
    needs to be non-NULL pointer.
    
    Function ath9k_stop() already contains code which sets ah->curchan to valid
    non-NULL pointer prior calling ath9k_hw_reset() function.
    
    Add same code pattern also into ath_reset_internal() function to prevent
    kernel NULL pointer dereference in ath9k_hw_reset() function.
    
    This change fixes kernel NULL pointer dereference in ath9k_hw_reset() which
    is caused by calling ath9k_hw_reset() from ath_reset_internal() with NULL
    chan structure.

    Note that this driver has already used some #ifdef in the .c file

    iio: accel: bmc150: Don't make the remove function of the second accelerometer unregister itself
    
    commit f407e2dca0f559621114eeaf657880d83f237fbd upstream.
    
    On machines with dual accelerometers described in a single ACPI fwnode,
    the bmc150_accel_probe() instantiates a second i2c-client for the second
    accelerometer.
    
    A pointer to this manually instantiated second i2c-client is stored
    inside the iio_dev's private-data through bmc150_set_second_device(),
    so that the i2c-client can be unregistered from bmc150_accel_remove().
    
    Before this commit bmc150_set_second_device() took only 1 argument so it
    would store the pointer in private-data of the iio_dev belonging to the
    manually instantiated i2c-client, leading to the bmc150_accel_remove()
    call for the second_dev trying to unregister *itself* while it was
    being removed, leading to a deadlock and rmmod hanging.
    
    Change bmc150_set_second_device() to take 2 arguments: 1. The i2c-client
    which is instantiating the second i2c-client for the 2nd accelerometer and
    2. The second-device pointer itself (which also is an i2c-client).
    
    This will store the second_device pointer in the private data of the
    iio_dev belonging to the (ACPI instantiated) i2c-client for the first
    accelerometer and will make bmc150_accel_remove() unregister the
    second_device i2c-client when called for the first client,
    avoiding the deadlock.

    iio: accel: bmc150: Fix dereferencing the wrong pointer in bmc150_get/set_second_device
    
    commit f2bf22dc9ea8ead180fc0221874bd556bf1d2685 upstream.
    
    The drvdata for iio-parent devices points to the struct iio_dev for
    the iio-device. So by directly casting the return from i2c_get_clientdata()
    to struct bmc150_accel_data * the code was ending up storing the second_dev
    pointer in (and retrieving it from) some semi-random offset inside
    struct iio_dev, rather then storing it in the second_dev member of the
    bmc150_accel_data struct.
    
    Fix the code to get the struct bmc150_accel_data * pointer to call
    iio_priv() on the struct iio_dev * returned by i2c_get_clientdata(),
    so that the correct pointer gets dereferenced.
    
    This fixes the following oops on rmmod, caused by trying to
    dereference the wrong return of bmc150_get_second_device():

    iio: accel: bmc150: Fix bma222 scale unit
    
    commit 6e2a90af0b8d757e850cc023d761ee9a9492e2fe upstream.
    
    According to sysfs-bus-iio documentation the unit for accelerometer
    values after applying scale/offset should be m/s^2, not g, which explains
    why the scale values for the other variants in bmc150-accel do not match
    exactly the values given in the datasheet.
    
    To get the correct values, we need to multiply the BMA222 scale values
    by g = 9.80665 m/s^2.

    iio: accel: bma180: Fix BMA25x bandwidth register values
    
    commit 8090d67421ddab0ae932abab5a60200598bf0bbb upstream.
    
    According to the BMA253 datasheet [1] and BMA250 datasheet [2] the
    bandwidth value for BMA25x should be set as 01xxx:
    
      "Settings 00xxx result in a bandwidth of 7.81 Hz; [...]
       It is recommended [...] to use the range from ´01000b´ to ´01111b´
       only in order to be compatible with future products."
    
    However, at the moment the drivers sets bandwidth values from 0 to 6,
    which is not recommended and always results into 7.81 Hz bandwidth
    according to the datasheet.
    
    Fix this by introducing a bw_offset = 8 = 01000b for BMA25x,
    so the additional bit is always set for BMA25x.

    commit 421a26f3d7a7c3ca43f3a9dc0f3cb0f562d5bd95 upstream.
    
    The ltr559 chip uses only the lowest bit of the ALS_CONTR register to
    configure between active and stand-by mode. In the original driver
    BIT(1) is used, which does a software reset instead.

    iio: ltr501: mark register holding upper 8 bits of ALS_DATA{0,1} and PS_DATA as volatile, too
    
    commit 2ac0b029a04b673ce83b5089368f467c5dca720c upstream.
    
    The regmap is configured for 8 bit registers, uses a RB-Tree cache and
    marks several registers as volatile (i.e. do not cache).
    
    The ALS and PS data registers in the chip are 16 bit wide and spans
    two regmap registers. In the current driver only the base register is
    marked as volatile, resulting in the upper register only read once.
    
    Further the data sheet notes:
    
    | When the I2C read operation starts, all four ALS data registers are
    | locked until the I2C read operation of register 0x8B is completed.
    
    Which results in the registers never update after the 2nd read.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by marking the upper 8 bits of the ALS
    and PS registers as volatile, too.

    clk: agilex/stratix10: add support for the 2nd bypass
    
    commit c2c9c5661a48bf2e67dcb4e989003144304acd6a upstream.
    
    The EMAC clocks on Stratix10/Agilex/N5X have an additional bypass that
    was not being accounted for. The bypass selects between
    emaca_clk/emacb_clk and boot_clk.
    
    Because the bypass register offset is different between Stratix10 and
    Agilex/N5X, it's best to create a new function to calculate the bypass.

    f2fs: Prevent swap file in LFS mode
    
    commit d927ccfccb009ede24448d69c08b12e7c8a6979b upstream.
    
    The kernel writes to swap files on f2fs directly without the assistance
    of the filesystem. This direct write by kernel can be non-sequential
    even when the f2fs is in LFS mode. Such non-sequential write conflicts
    with the LFS semantics. Especially when f2fs is set up on zoned block
    devices, the non-sequential write causes unaligned write command errors.
    
    To avoid the non-sequential writes to swap files, prevent swap file
    activation when the filesystem is in LFS mode.

    s390/cio: dont call css_wait_for_slow_path() inside a lock
    
    commit c749d8c018daf5fba6dfac7b6c5c78b27efd7d65 upstream.
    
    Currently css_wait_for_slow_path() gets called inside the chp->lock.
    The path-verification-loop of slowpath inside this lock could lead to
    deadlock as reported by the lockdep validator.
    
    The ccw_device_get_chp_desc() during the instance of a device-set-online
    would try to acquire the same 'chp->lock' to read the chp->desc.
    The instance of this function can get called from multiple scenario,
    like probing or setting-device online manually. This could, in some
    corner-cases lead to the deadlock.
    
    lockdep validator reported this as,
    
            CPU0                    CPU1
            ----                    ----

       lock((wq_completion)cio);
    
    The chp->lock was introduced to serialize the access of struct
    channel_path. This lock is not needed for the css_wait_for_slow_path()
    function, so invoke the slow-path function outside this lock.

    KVM: x86: Force all MMUs to reinitialize if guest CPUID is modified
    
    commit 49c6f8756cdffeb9af1fbcb86bacacced26465d7 upstream.
    
    Invalidate all MMUs' roles after a CPUID update to force reinitizliation
    of the MMU context/helpers.  Despite the efforts of commit de3ccd26fafc
    ("KVM: MMU: record maximum physical address width in kvm_mmu_extended_role"),
    there are still a handful of CPUID-based properties that affect MMU
    behavior but are not incorporated into mmu_role.  E.g. 1gb hugepage
    support, AMD vs. Intel handling of bit 8, and SEV's C-Bit location all
    factor into the guest's reserved PTE bits.
    
    The obvious alternative would be to add all such properties to mmu_role,
    but doing so provides no benefit over simply forcing a reinitialization
    on every CPUID update, as setting guest CPUID is a rare operation.
    
    Note, reinitializing all MMUs after a CPUID update does not fix all of
    KVM's woes.  Specifically, kvm_mmu_page_role doesn't track the CPUID
    properties, which means that a vCPU can reuse shadow pages that should
    not exist for the new vCPU model, e.g. that map GPAs that are now illegal
    (due to MAXPHYADDR changes) or that set bits that are now reserved
    (PAGE_SIZE for 1gb pages), etc...
    
    Tracking the relevant CPUID properties in kvm_mmu_page_role would address
    the majority of problems, but fully tracking that much state in the
    shadow page role comes with an unpalatable cost as it would require a
    non-trivial increase in KVM's memory footprint.  The GBPAGES case is even
    worse, as neither Intel nor AMD provides a way to disable 1gb hugepage
    support in the hardware page walker, i.e. it's a virtualization hole that
    can't be closed when using TDP.
    
    In other words, resetting the MMU after a CPUID update is largely a
    superficial fix.  But, it will allow reverting the tracking of MAXPHYADDR
    in the mmu_role, and that case in particular needs to mostly work because
    KVM's shadow_root_level depends on guest MAXPHYADDR when 5-level paging
    is supported.  For cases where KVM botches guest behavior, the damage is
    limited to that guest.  But for the shadow_root_level, a misconfigured
    MMU can cause KVM to incorrectly access memory, e.g. due to walking off
    the end of its shadow page tables.

    KVM: x86: Properly reset MMU context at vCPU RESET/INIT
    
    commit 0aa1837533e5f4be8cc21bbc06314c23ba2c5447 upstream.
    
    Reset the MMU context at vCPU INIT (and RESET for good measure) if CR0.PG
    was set prior to INIT.  Simply re-initializing the current MMU is not
    sufficient as the current root HPA may not be usable in the new context.
    E.g. if TDP is disabled and INIT arrives while the vCPU is in long mode,
    KVM will fail to switch to the 32-bit pae_root and bomb on the next
    VM-Enter due to running with a 64-bit CR3 in 32-bit mode.
    
    This bug was papered over in both VMX and SVM, but still managed to rear
    its head in the MMU role on VMX.  Because EFER.LMA=1 requires CR0.PG=1,
    kvm_calc_shadow_mmu_root_page_role() checks for EFER.LMA without first
    checking CR0.PG.  VMX's RESET/INIT flow writes CR0 before EFER, and so
    an INIT with the vCPU in 64-bit mode will cause the hack-a-fix to
    generate the wrong MMU role.
    
    In VMX, the INIT issue is specific to running without unrestricted guest
    since unrestricted guest is available if and only if EPT is enabled.
    Commit 8668a3c468ed ("KVM: VMX: Reset mmu context when entering real
    mode") resolved the issue by forcing a reset when entering emulated real
    mode.
    
    In SVM, commit ebae871a509d ("kvm: svm: reset mmu on VCPU reset") forced
    a MMU reset on every INIT to workaround the flaw in common x86.  Note, at
    the time the bug was fixed, the SVM problem was exacerbated by a complete
    lack of a CR4 update.
    
    The vendor resets will be reverted in future patches, primarily to aid
    bisection in case there are non-INIT flows that rely on the existing VMX
    logic.
    
    Because CR0.PG is unconditionally cleared on INIT, and because CR0.WP and
    all CR4/EFER paging bits are ignored if CR0.PG=0, simply checking that
    CR0.PG was '1' prior to INIT/RESET is sufficient to detect a required MMU
    context reset.

    Use the MMU's role to get its effective SMEP value when injecting a fault
    into the guest.  When walking L1's (nested) NPT while L2 is active, vCPU
    state will reflect L2, whereas NPT uses the host's (L1 in this case) CR0,
    CR4, EFER, etc...  If L1 and L2 have different settings for SMEP and
    L1 does not have EFER.NX=1, this can result in an incorrect PFEC.FETCH
    when injecting #NPF.

    KVM: x86/mmu: Treat NX as used (not reserved) for all !TDP shadow MMUs
    
    commit 112022bdb5bc372e00e6e43cb88ee38ea67b97bd upstream.
    
    Mark NX as being used for all non-nested shadow MMUs, as KVM will set the
    NX bit for huge SPTEs if the iTLB mutli-hit mitigation is enabled.
    Checking the mitigation itself is not sufficient as it can be toggled on
    at any time and KVM doesn't reset MMU contexts when that happens.  KVM
    could reset the contexts, but that would require purging all SPTEs in all
    MMUs, for no real benefit.  And, KVM already forces EFER.NX=1 when TDP is
    disabled (for WP=0, SMEP=1, NX=0), so technically NX is never reserved
    for shadow MMUs.

    KVM: x86/mmu: Remove broken WARN that fires on 32-bit KVM w/ nested EPT
    
    commit f0d4379087d8a83f478b371ff7786e8df0cc2314 upstream.
    
    Remove a misguided WARN that attempts to detect the scenario where using
    a special A/D tracking flag will set reserved bits on a non-MMIO spte.
    The WARN triggers false positives when using EPT with 32-bit KVM because
    of the !64-bit clause, which is just flat out wrong.  The whole A/D
    tracking goo is specific to EPT, and one of the big selling points of EPT
    is that EPT is decoupled from the host's native paging mode.
    
    Drop the WARN instead of trying to salvage the check.  Keeping a check
    specific to A/D tracking bits would essentially regurgitate the same code
    that led to KVM needed the tracking bits in the first place.
    
    A better approach would be to add a generic WARN on reserved bits being
    set, which would naturally cover the A/D tracking bits, work for all
    flavors of paging, and be self-documenting to some extent.

    KVM: nVMX: Handle split-lock #AC exceptions that happen in L2
    
    commit b33bb78a1fada6445c265c585ee0dd0fc6279102 upstream.
    
    Mark #ACs that won't be reinjected to the guest as wanted by L0 so that
    KVM handles split-lock #AC from L2 instead of forwarding the exception to
    L1.  Split-lock #AC isn't yet virtualized, i.e. L1 will treat it like a
    regular #AC and do the wrong thing, e.g. reinject it into L2.

    perf/smmuv3: Don't trample existing events with global filter
    
    commit 4c1daba15c209b99d192f147fea3dade30f72ed2 upstream.
    
    With global filtering, we only allow an event to be scheduled if its
    filter settings exactly match those of any existing events, therefore
    it is pointless to reapply the filter in that case. Much worse, though,
    is that in doing that we trample the event type of counter 0 if it's
    already active, and never touch the appropriate PMEVTYPERn so the new
    event is likely not counting the right thing either. Don't do that.

    mm/gup: fix try_grab_compound_head() race with split_huge_page()
    
    commit c24d37322548a6ec3caec67100d28b9c1f89f60a upstream.
    
    try_grab_compound_head() is used to grab a reference to a page from
    get_user_pages_fast(), which is only protected against concurrent freeing
    of page tables (via local_irq_save()), but not against concurrent TLB
    flushes, freeing of data pages, or splitting of compound pages.
    
    Because no reference is held to the page when try_grab_compound_head() is
    called, the page may have been freed and reallocated by the time its
    refcount has been elevated; therefore, once we're holding a stable
    reference to the page, the caller re-checks whether the PTE still points
    to the same page (with the same access rights).
    
    The problem is that try_grab_compound_head() has to grab a reference on
    the head page; but between the time we look up what the head page is and
    the time we actually grab a reference on the head page, the compound page
    may have been split up (either explicitly through split_huge_page() or by
    freeing the compound page to the buddy allocator and then allocating its
    individual order-0 pages).  If that happens, get_user_pages_fast() may end
    up returning the right page but lifting the refcount on a now-unrelated
    page, leading to use-after-free of pages.
    
    To fix it: Re-check whether the pages still belong together after lifting
    the refcount on the head page.  Move anything else that checks
    compound_head(page) below the refcount increment.
    
    This can't actually happen on bare-metal x86 (because there, disabling
    IRQs locks out remote TLB flushes), but it can happen on virtualized x86
    (e.g.  under KVM) and probably also on arm64.  The race window is pretty
    narrow, and constantly allocating and shattering hugepages isn't exactly
    fast; for now I've only managed to reproduce this in an x86 KVM guest with
    an artificially widened timing window (by adding a loop that repeatedly
    calls `inl(0x3f8 + 5)` in `try_get_compound_head()` to force VM exits, so
    that PV TLB flushes are used instead of IPIs).
    
    As requested on the list, also replace the existing VM_BUG_ON_PAGE() with
    a warning and bailout.  Since the existing code only performed the BUG_ON
    check on DEBUG_VM kernels, ensure that the new code also only performs the
    check under that configuration - I don't want to mix two logically
    separate changes together too much.  The macro VM_WARN_ON_ONCE_PAGE()
    doesn't return a value on !DEBUG_VM, so wrap the whole check in an #ifdef
    block.  An alternative would be to change the VM_WARN_ON_ONCE_PAGE()
    definition for !DEBUG_VM such that it always returns false, but since that
    would differ from the behavior of the normal WARN macros, it might be too
    confusing for readers.

    bus: mhi: Wait for M2 state during system resume
    
    commit 02b49cd1174527e611768fc2ce0f75a74dfec7ae upstream.
    
    During system resume, MHI host triggers M3->M0 transition and then waits
    for target device to enter M0 state. Once done, the device queues a state
    change event into ctrl event ring and notifies MHI host by raising an
    interrupt, where a tasklet is scheduled to process this event. In most
    cases, the tasklet is served timely and wait operation succeeds.
    
    However, there are cases where CPU is busy and cannot serve this tasklet
    for some time. Once delay goes long enough, the device moves itself to M1
    state and also interrupts MHI host after inserting a new state change
    event to ctrl ring. Later when CPU finally has time to process the ring,
    there will be two events:
    
    1. For M3->M0 event, which is the first event to be processed queued first.
       The tasklet handler serves the event, updates device state to M0 and
       wakes up the task.
    
    2. For M0->M1 event, which is processed later, the tasklet handler
       triggers M1->M2 transition and updates device state to M2 directly,
       then wakes up the MHI host (if it is still sleeping on this wait queue).
    
    Note that although MHI host has been woken up while processing the first
    event, it may still has no chance to run before the second event is
    processed. In other words, MHI host has to keep waiting till timeout
    causing the M0 state to be missed.

    bus: mhi: core: Fix power down latency
    
    commit 44b1eba44dc537edf076f131f1eeee7544d0e04f upstream.
    
    On graceful power-down/disable transition, when an MHI reset is
    performed, the MHI device loses its context, including interrupt
    configuration. However, the current implementation is waiting for
    event(irq) driven state change to confirm reset has been completed,
    which never happens, and causes reset timeout, leading to unexpected
    high latency of the mhi_power_down procedure (up to 45 seconds).
    
    Fix that by moving to the recently introduced poll_reg_field method,
    waiting for the reset bit to be cleared, in the same way as the
    power_on procedure.

    SUNRPC: Should wake up the privileged task firstly.
    
    commit 5483b904bf336948826594610af4c9bbb0d9e3aa upstream.
    
    When find a task from wait queue to wake up, a non-privileged task may
    be found out, rather than the privileged. This maybe lead a deadlock
    same as commit dfe1fe75e00e ("NFSv4: Fix deadlock between nfs4_evict_inode()
    and nfs4_opendata_get_inode()"):
    
    Privileged delegreturn task is queued to privileged list because all
    the slots are assigned. If there has no enough slot to wake up the
    non-privileged batch tasks(session less than 8 slot), then the privileged
    delegreturn task maybe lost waked up because the found out task can't
    get slot since the session is on draining.
    
    So we should treate the privileged task as the emergency task, and
    execute it as for as we can.

    can: isotp: isotp_release(): omit unintended hrtimer restart on socket release
    
    commit 14a4696bc3118ba49da28f79280e1d55603aa737 upstream.
    
    When closing the isotp socket, the potentially running hrtimers are
    canceled before removing the subscription for CAN identifiers via
    can_rx_unregister().
    
    This may lead to an unintended (re)start of a hrtimer in
    isotp_rcv_cf() and isotp_rcv_fc() in the case that a CAN frame is
    received by isotp_rcv() while the subscription removal is processed.
    
    However, isotp_rcv() is called under RCU protection, so after calling
    can_rx_unregister, we may call synchronize_rcu in order to wait for
    any RCU read-side critical sections to finish. This prevents the
    reception of CAN frames after hrtimer_cancel() and therefore the
    unintended (re)start of the hrtimers.

    can: bcm: delay release of struct bcm_op after synchronize_rcu()
    
    commit d5f9023fa61ee8b94f37a93f08e94b136cf1e463 upstream.
    
    can_rx_register() callbacks may be called concurrently to the call to
    can_rx_unregister(). The callbacks and callback data, though, are
    protected by RCU and the struct sock reference count.
    
    So the callback data is really attached to the life of sk, meaning
    that it should be released on sk_destruct. However, bcm_remove_op()
    calls tasklet_kill(), and RCU callbacks may be called under RCU
    softirq, so that cannot be used on kernels before the introduction of
    HRTIMER_MODE_SOFT.
    
    However, bcm_rx_handler() is called under RCU protection, so after
    calling can_rx_unregister(), we may call synchronize_rcu() in order to
    wait for any RCU read-side critical sections to finish. That is,
    bcm_rx_handler() won't be called anymore for those ops. So, we only
    free them, after we do that synchronize_rcu().

    ext4: use ext4_grp_locked_error in mb_find_extent
    
    commit cd84bbbac12a173a381a64c6ec8b76a5277b87b5 upstream.
    
    Commit 5d1b1b3f492f ("ext4: fix BUG when calling ext4_error with locked
    block group") introduces ext4_grp_locked_error to handle unlocking a
    group in error cases. Otherwise, there is a possibility of a sleep while
    atomic. However, since 43c73221b3b1 ("ext4: replace BUG_ON with WARN_ON
    in mb_find_extent()"), mb_find_extent() has contained a ext4_error()
    call while a group spinlock is held. Replace this with
    ext4_grp_locked_error.

    ext4: cleanup in-core orphan list if ext4_truncate() failed to get a transaction handle

    In ext4_orphan_cleanup(), if ext4_truncate() failed to get a transaction
    handle, it didn't remove the inode from the in-core orphan list, which
    may probably trigger below error dump in ext4_destroy_inode() during the
    final iput() and could lead to memory corruption on the later orphan
    list changes.

    btrfs: compression: don't try to compress if we don't have enough pages
    
    commit f2165627319ffd33a6217275e5690b1ab5c45763 upstream.
    
    The early check if we should attempt compression does not take into
    account the number of input pages. It can happen that there's only one
    page, eg. a tail page after some ranges of the BTRFS_MAX_UNCOMPRESSED
    have been processed, or an isolated page that won't be converted to an
    inline extent.
    
    The single page would be compressed but a later check would drop it
    again because the result size must be at least one block shorter than
    the input. That can never work with just one page.

    btrfs: send: fix invalid path for unlink operations after parent orphanization
    
    commit d8ac76cdd1755b21e8c008c28d0b7251c0b14986 upstream.
    
    During an incremental send operation, when processing the new references
    for the current inode, we might send an unlink operation for another inode
    that has a conflicting path and has more than one hard link. However this
    path was computed and cached before we processed previous new references
    for the current inode. We may have orphanized a directory of that path
    while processing a previous new reference, in which case the path will
    be invalid and cause the receiver process to fail.
    
    The following reproducer triggers the problem and explains how/why it
    happens in its comments:
    
      $ cat test-send-unlink.sh
      #!/bin/bash

      # links.

      touch $MNT/file2
      touch $MNT/file3
    
      mkdir $MNT/A

      # Later when processing inode 258, it first processes its new reference

      # because there is a a path collision. This results in issuing a rename
      # operation from "/A" to "/o260-6-0".
      #
      # Finally when processing the new reference "B/hard_link" for inode 258,
      # it notices that it collides with inode 259 (not yet processed, because
      # it has a higher inode number), since that inode has the name
      # "hard_link" under the directory inode 260. It also checks that inode
      # 259 has two hardlinks, so it decides to issue a unlink operation for
      # the name "hard_link" for inode 259. However the path passed to the
      # unlink operation is "/A/hard_link", which is incorrect since currently
      # "/A" does not exists, due to the orphanization of inode 260 mentioned
      # before. The path is incorrect because it was computed and cached
      # before the orphanization. This results in the receiver to fail with
      # the above error.

    When running the test, it fails like this:
    
      $ ./test-send-unlink.sh
      Create a readonly snapshot of '/mnt/sdi' in '/mnt/sdi/snap1'
      At subvol /mnt/sdi/snap1
      Create a readonly snapshot of '/mnt/sdi' in '/mnt/sdi/snap2'
      At subvol /mnt/sdi/snap2
      At subvol snap1
      At snapshot snap2
      ERROR: unlink A/hard_link failed: No such file or directory
    
    Fix this by recomputing a path before issuing an unlink operation when
    processing the new references for the current inode if we previously
    have orphanized a directory.
    
    A test case for fstests will follow soon.

    btrfs: zoned: bail out if we can't read a reliable write pointer
    
    commit 06e1e7f4223c98965fb721b4b1e12083cfbe777e upstream.
    
    If we can't read a reliable write pointer from a sequential zone fail
    creating the block group with an I/O error.
    
    Also if the read write pointer is beyond the end of the respective zone,
    fail the creation of the block group on this zone with an I/O error.
    
    While this could also happen in real world scenarios with misbehaving
    drives, this issue addresses a problem uncovered by fstests' test case
    generic/475.

    arm_pmu: Fix write counter incorrect in ARMv7 big-endian mode
    
    commit fdbef8c4e68ad423416aa6cc93d1616d6f8ac5b3 upstream.
    
    Commit 3a95200d3f89 ("arm_pmu: Change API to support 64bit counter values")
    changes the input "value" type from 32-bit to 64-bit, which introduces the
    following problem: ARMv7 PMU counters is 32-bit width, in big-endian mode,
    write counter uses high 32-bit, which writes an incorrect value.
    
    Before:
    
     Performance counter stats for 'ls':
    
                  2.22 msec task-clock                #    0.675 CPUs utilized
                     0      context-switches          #    0.000 K/sec
                     0      cpu-migrations            #    0.000 K/sec
                    49      page-faults               #    0.022 M/sec
            2150476593      cycles                    #  966.663 GHz

            2147745484      branches                  # 965435.074 M/sec
            2147508540      branch-misses             #   99.99% of all branches
    
    None of the above hw event counters are correct.
    
    Solution:
    
    "value" forcibly converted to 32-bit type before being written to PMU register.
    
    After:
    
     Performance counter stats for 'ls':
    
                  2.09 msec task-clock                #    0.681 CPUs utilized

    crypto: ccp - Annotate SEV Firmware file names
    
    commit c8671c7dc7d51125ab9f651697866bf4a9132277 upstream.
    
    Annotate the firmware files CCP might need using MODULE_FIRMWARE().
    This will get them included into an initrd when CCP is also included
    there. Otherwise the CCP module will not find its firmware when loaded
    before the root-fs is mounted.
    This can cause problems when the pre-loaded SEV firmware is too old to
    support current SEV and SEV-ES virtualization features.

    Input: joydev - prevent use of not validated data in JSIOCSBTNMAP ioctl
    
    commit f8f84af5da9ee04ef1d271528656dac42a090d00 upstream.
    
    Even though we validate user-provided inputs we then traverse past
    validated data when applying the new map. The issue was originally
    discovered by Murray McAllister with this simple POC (if the following
    is executed by an unprivileged user it will instantly panic the system):
    
    int main(void) {
            int fd, ret;
            unsigned int buffer[10000];
    
            fd = open("/dev/input/js0", O_RDONLY);
            if (fd == -1)
                    printf("Error opening file\n");
    
            ret = ioctl(fd, JSIOCSBTNMAP & ~IOCSIZE_MASK, &buffer);
            printf("%d\n", ret);
    }
    
    The solution is to traverse internal buffer which is guaranteed to only
    contain valid date when constructing the map.

    The recent change in elants_i2c driver to support more chips
    introduced a regression leading to Oops at probing.  The driver reads
    id->driver_data, but the id may be NULL depending on the device type
    the driver gets bound.

    teach copy_page_to_iter() to handle compound pages
    
    commit 08aa64796016cb47b2ef3d0924653b4d944b0d65 upstream.
    
            In situation when copy_page_to_iter() got a compound page the current
    code would only work on systems with no CONFIG_HIGHMEM.  It *is* the majority
    of real-world setups, or we would've drown in bug reports by now.  Still needs
    fixing.
    
            Current variant works for solitary page; rename that to
    __copy_page_to_iter() and turn the handling of compound pages into a loop over
    subpages.

    record + file name offset + file name length) < (attr record + attr record
    length).
    
    However, the original check did not include the file name offset in the
    calculation.  This means that corrupted on-disk metadata might not caught
    by the incorrect file name check, and lead to an invalid memory access.
    
    An example can be seen in the crash report of a memory corruption error
    found by Syzbot:
    https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=a1a1e379b225812688566745c3e2f7242bffc246
    
    Adding the file name offset to the validity check fixes this error and
    passes the Syzbot reproducer test.

    commit 5d49d3508b3c67201bd3e1bf7f4ef049111b7051 upstream.
    
    On an error path, init_statfs calls iput(pn) after pn has already been put.
    Fix that by setting pn to NULL after the initial iput.

    mm/page_alloc: fix memory map initialization for descending nodes
    
    commit 122e093c1734361dedb64f65c99b93e28e4624f4 upstream.
    
    On systems with memory nodes sorted in descending order, for instance Dell
    Precision WorkStation T5500, the struct pages for higher PFNs and
    respectively lower nodes, could be overwritten by the initialization of
    struct pages corresponding to the holes in the memory sections.
    
    For example for the below memory layout
    
    [    0.245624] Early memory node ranges
    [    0.248496]   node   1: [mem 0x0000000000001000-0x0000000000090fff]
    [    0.251376]   node   1: [mem 0x0000000000100000-0x00000000dbdf8fff]
    [    0.254256]   node   1: [mem 0x0000000100000000-0x0000001423ffffff]
    [    0.257144]   node   0: [mem 0x0000001424000000-0x0000002023ffffff]
    
    the range 0x1424000000 - 0x1428000000 in the beginning of node 0 starts in
    the middle of a section and will be considered as a hole during the
    initialization of the last section in node 1.
    
    The wrong initialization of the memory map causes panic on boot when
    CONFIG_DEBUG_VM is enabled.
    
    Reorder loop order of the memory map initialization so that the outer loop
    will always iterate over populated memory regions in the ascending order
    and the inner loop will select the zone corresponding to the PFN range.
    
    This way initialization of the struct pages for the memory holes will be
    always done for the ranges that are actually not populated.

    xhci: solve a double free problem while doing s4
    
    commit b31d9d6d7abbf6483b871b6370bc31c930d53f54 upstream.
    
    when system is doing s4, the process of xhci_resume may be as below:
    1、xhci_mem_cleanup
    2、xhci_init->xhci_mem_init->xhci_mem_cleanup(when memory is not enough).
    xhci_mem_cleanup will be executed twice when system is out of memory.
    xhci->port_caps is freed in xhci_mem_cleanup,but it isn't set to NULL.
    It will be freed twice when xhci_mem_cleanup is called the second time.
    
    We got following bug when system resumes from s4:

    commit 2b537cf877eae6d2f2f102052290676e40b74a1d upstream.
    
    If the voltage is being decreased in power negotiation, the Source will
    set the power supply to operate at the new voltage level before sending
    PS_RDY. Relax the threshold before sending Request Message so that it
    will not race with Source which begins to adjust the voltage right after
    it sends Accept Message (PPS) or tSrcTransition (25~35ms) after it sends
    Accept Message (non-PPS).
    
    The real threshold will be set after Sink receives PS_RDY Message.

    USB: cdc-acm: blacklist Heimann USB Appset device
    
    commit 4897807753e078655a78de39ed76044d784f3e63 upstream.
    
    The device (32a7:0000 Heimann Sensor GmbH USB appset demo) claims to be
    a CDC-ACM device in its descriptors but in fact is not. If it is run
    with echo disabled it returns garbled data, probably due to something
    that happens in the TTY layer. And when run with echo enabled (the
    default), it will mess up the calibration data of the sensor the first
    time any data is sent to the device.
    
    In short, I had a bad time after connecting the sensor and trying to get
    it to work. I hope blacklisting it in the cdc-acm driver will save
    someone else a bit of trouble.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix bass speaker DAC mapping for Asus UM431D
    
    commit f8fbcdfb0665de60997d9746809e1704ed782bbc upstream.
    
    Asus Zenbook 14 UM431D has two speaker pins and a headphone pin, and
    the auto-parser ends up assigning the bass to the third DAC 0x06.
    Although the tone comes out, it's inconvenient because this DAC has no
    volume control unlike two other DACs.
    
    For obtaining the volume control for the bass speaker, this patch
    enforces the mapping to let both front and bass speaker pins sharing
    the same DAC.  It's not ideal but a little bit of improvement.
    
    Since we've already applied the same workaround for another ASUS
    machine, we just need to hook the chain to the existing quirk.

    commit 434591b2a77def0e78abfa38e5d7c4bca954e68a upstream.
    
    On HP Spectre x360 15-df0xxx, after system boot with plugged headset, the
    headset mic are not detected.
    Moving pincfg and DAC's config to single fixup function fix this.
    
    [ The actual bug in the original code was that it used a chain to
      ALC286_FIXUP_SPEAKER2_TO_DAC1, and it contains not only the DAC1
      route fix but also another chain to ALC269_FIXUP_THINKPAD_ACPI.
      I thought the latter one is harmless for non-Thinkpad, but it
      doesn't seem so; it contains again yet another chain to
      ALC269_FIXUP_SKI_IGNORE, and this might be bad for some machines,
      including this HP machine.  -- tiwai ]

    ALSA: usb-audio: scarlett2: Fix wrong resume call
    
    commit 785b6f29a795f109685f286b91e0250c206fbffb upstream.
    
    The current way of the scarlett2 mixer code managing the
    usb_mixer_elem_info object is wrong in two ways: it passes its
    internal index to the head.id field, and the val_type field is
    uninitialized.  This ended up with the wrong execution at the resume
    because a bogus unit id is passed wrongly.  Also, in the later code
    extensions, we'll have more mixer elements, and passing the index will
    overflow the unit id size (of 256).
    
    This patch corrects those issues.  It introduces a new value type,
    USB_MIXER_BESPOKEN, which indicates a non-standard mixer element, and
    use this type for all scarlett2 mixer elements, as well as
    initializing the fixed unit id 0 for avoiding the overflow.

    Bluetooth: btqca: Don't modify firmware contents in-place
    
    commit b43ca511178ed0ab6fd2405df28cf9e100273020 upstream.
    
    struct firmware::data is marked const, and when the firmware is
    compressed with xz (default at least with Fedora) it's mapped read-only
    which results in a crash:

    This also seems to fix a failure to suspend due to the firmware
    download on bootup getting interrupted by the crash:

    Bluetooth: hci_qca: fix potential GPF
    
    commit 59f90f1351282ea2dbd0c59098fd9bb2634e920e upstream.
    
    In qca_power_shutdown() qcadev local variable is
    initialized by hu->serdev.dev private data, but
    hu->serdev can be NULL and there is a check for it.
    
    Since, qcadev is not used before
    
            if (!hu->serdev)
                    return;
    
    we can move its initialization after this "if" to
    prevent GPF.
