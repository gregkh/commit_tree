    ARM: fix kill( ,SIGFPE) breakage
    
    [ Upstream commit 92d44a42af81e850a038c38278ff4f434b2871df ]
    
    Commit 7771c6645700 ("signal/arm: Document conflicts with SI_USER and
    SIGFPE") broke the siginfo structure for userspace triggered signals,
    causing the strace testsuite to regress.  Fix this by eliminating
    the FPE_FIXME definition (which is at the root of the breakage) and
    use FPE_FLTINV instead for the case where the hardware appears to be
    reporting nonsense.

    ARM: replace unnecessary perl with sed and the shell $(( )) operator
    
    [ Upstream commit 6cea14f55474ec71f1098228e0ae5dd2a8f22c0a ]
    
    You can build a kernel in a cross compiling environment that doesn't
    have perl in the $PATH. Commit 429f7a062e3b broke that for 32 bit
    ARM. Fix it.
    
    As reported by Stephen Rothwell, it appears that the symbols can be
    either part of the BSS section or absolute symbols depending on the
    binutils version.  When they're an absolute symbol, the $(( ))
    operator errors out and the build fails.  Fix this as well.

    ARM: kexec: fix kdump register saving on panic()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d7b3c64431245c95b05a441669c074da10db943 ]
    
    When a panic() occurs, the kexec code uses smp_send_stop() to stop
    the other CPUs, but this results in the CPU register state not being
    saved, and gdb is unable to inspect the state of other CPUs.
    
    Commit 0ee59413c967 ("x86/panic: replace smp_send_stop() with kdump
    friendly version in panic path") addressed the issue on x86, but
    ignored other architectures.  Address the issue on ARM by splitting
    out the crash stop implementation to crash_smp_send_stop() and
    adding the necessary protection.

    efi/libstub/arm64: Handle randomized TEXT_OFFSET
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f74d72aa7067e75af92fbab077e6d7d0210be66 ]
    
    When CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_TEXT_OFFSET=y, TEXT_OFFSET is an arbitrary
    multiple of PAGE_SIZE in the interval [0, 2MB).
    
    The EFI stub does not account for the potential misalignment of
    TEXT_OFFSET relative to EFI_KIMG_ALIGN, and produces a randomized
    physical offset which is always a round multiple of EFI_KIMG_ALIGN.
    This may result in statically allocated objects whose alignment exceeds
    PAGE_SIZE to appear misaligned in memory. This has been observed to
    result in spurious stack overflow reports and failure to make use of
    the IRQ stacks, and theoretically could result in a number of other
    issues.
    
    We can OR in the low bits of TEXT_OFFSET to ensure that we have the
    necessary offset (and hence preserve the misalignment of TEXT_OFFSET
    relative to EFI_KIMG_ALIGN), so let's do that.

    drm/dumb-buffers: Integer overflow in drm_mode_create_ioctl()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b6207291b7b277a5df9d1aab44b56815a292dba ]
    
    There is a comment here which says that DIV_ROUND_UP() and that's where
    the problem comes from.  Say you pick:
    
            args->bpp = UINT_MAX - 7;
            args->width = 4;
            args->height = 1;
    
    The integer overflow in DIV_ROUND_UP() means "cpp" is UINT_MAX / 8 and
    because of how we picked args->width that means cpp < UINT_MAX / 4.
    
    I've fixed it by preventing the integer overflow in DIV_ROUND_UP().  I
    removed the check for !cpp because it's not possible after this change.
    I also changed all the 0xffffffffU references to U32_MAX.

    locking/percpu-rwsem: Annotate rwsem ownership transfer by setting RWSEM_OWNER_UNKNOWN
    
    [ Upstream commit 5a817641f68a6399a5fac8b7d2da67a73698ffed ]
    
    The filesystem freezing code needs to transfer ownership of a rwsem
    embedded in a percpu-rwsem from the task that does the freezing to
    another one that does the thawing by calling percpu_rwsem_release()
    after freezing and percpu_rwsem_acquire() before thawing.
    
    However, the new rwsem debug code runs afoul with this scheme by warning
    that the task that releases the rwsem isn't the one that acquires it,
    as reported by Amir Goldstein:
    
      DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(sem->owner != get_current())
      WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1401 at /home/amir/build/src/linux/kernel/locking/rwsem.c:133 up_write+0x59/0x79

       entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x49/0xbe
    
    To work properly with the rwsem debug code, we need to annotate that the
    rwsem ownership is unknown during the tranfer period until a brave soul
    comes forward to acquire the ownership. During that period, optimistic
    spinning will be disabled.

    locking/rwsem: Add a new RWSEM_ANONYMOUSLY_OWNED flag
    
    [ Upstream commit d7d760efad70c7a030725499bf9f342f04af24dd ]
    
    There are use cases where a rwsem can be acquired by one task, but
    released by another task. In thess cases, optimistic spinning may need
    to be disabled.  One example will be the filesystem freeze/thaw code
    where the task that freezes the filesystem will acquire a write lock
    on a rwsem and then un-owns it before returning to userspace. Later on,
    another task will come along, acquire the ownership, thaw the filesystem
    and release the rwsem.
    
    Bit 0 of the owner field was used to designate that it is a reader
    owned rwsem. It is now repurposed to mean that the owner of the rwsem
    is not known. If only bit 0 is set, the rwsem is reader owned. If bit
    0 and other bits are set, it is writer owned with an unknown owner.
    One such value for the latter case is (-1L). So we can set owner to 1 for
    reader-owned, -1 for writer-owned. The owner is unknown in both cases.
    
    To handle transfer of rwsem ownership, the higher level code should
    set the owner field to -1 to indicate a write-locked rwsem with unknown
    owner.  Optimistic spinning will be disabled in this case.
    
    Once the higher level code figures who the new owner is, it can then
    set the owner field accordingly.

    mtd: rawnand: Fix return type of __DIVIDE() when called with 32-bit
    
    [ Upstream commit 9f825e74d761c13b0cfaa5f65344d64ff970e252 ]
    
    The __DIVIDE() macro checks whether it is called with a 32-bit or 64-bit
    dividend, to select the appropriate divide-and-round-up routine.
    As the check uses the ternary operator, the result will always be
    promoted to a type that can hold both results, i.e. unsigned long long.
    
    When using this result in a division on a 32-bit system, this may lead
    to link errors like:
    
        ERROR: "__udivdi3" [drivers/mtd/nand/raw/nand.ko] undefined!
    
    Fix this by casting the result of the division to the type of the
    dividend.

    KVM: X86: Lower the default timer frequency limit to 200us
    
    [ Upstream commit 4c27625b7a67eb9006963ed2bcf8e53b259b43af ]
    
    Anthoine reported:
     The period used by Windows change over time but it can be 1
     milliseconds or less. I saw the limit_periodic_timer_frequency
     print so 500 microseconds is sometimes reached.
    
    As suggested by Paolo, lower the default timer frequency limit to a
    smaller interval of 200 us (5000 Hz) to leave some headroom. This
    is required due to Windows 10 changing the scheduler tick limit
    from 1024 Hz to 2048 Hz.

    [ Upstream commit bb7298a7e87cf3430eb62be8746e5d7a07ca9d7c ]
    
    VPIF capture driver expects card name to be set since it
    uses it without checking for NULL. The commit which
    introduced VPIF display and capture support added card
    name only for display, not for capture.
    
    Set it in platform data to probe driver successfully.
    
    While at it, also fix the display card name to something more
    appropriate.

    When INTPRIn register setting for an interrupt is left at 0, it is
    mapped to FIQ by the AINTC causing the timer interrupt to not get

    ARM: keystone: fix platform_domain_notifier array overrun
    
    [ Upstream commit 9954b80b8c0e8abc98e17bba0fccd9876211ceaa ]
    
    platform_domain_notifier contains a variable sized array, which the
    pm_clk_notify() notifier treats as a NULL terminated array:
    
         for (con_id = clknb->con_ids; *con_id; con_id++)
                 pm_clk_add(dev, *con_id);
    
    Omitting the initialiser for con_ids means that the array is zero
    sized, and there is no NULL terminator.  This leads to pm_clk_notify()
    overrunning into what ever structure follows, which may not be NULL.
    This leads to an oops:

    usb: musb: fix remote wakeup racing with suspend
    
    [ Upstream commit ebc3dd688cd988754a304147753b13e58de1b5a1 ]
    
    It has been observed that writing 0xF2 to the power register while it
    reads as 0xF4 results in the register having the value 0xF0, i.e. clearing
    RESUME and setting SUSPENDM in one go does not work. It might also violate
    the USB spec to transition directly from resume to suspend, especially
    when not taking T_DRSMDN into account. But this is what happens when a
    remote wakeup occurs between SetPortFeature USB_PORT_FEAT_SUSPEND on the
    root hub and musb_bus_suspend being called.
    
    This commit returns -EBUSY when musb_bus_suspend is called while remote
    wakeup is signalled and thus avoids to reset the RESUME bit. Ignoring
    this error when musb_port_suspend is called from musb_hub_control is ok.

    [ Upstream commit 4776cab43fd3111618112737a257dc3ef368eddd ]
    
    Some AFS servers refuse to accept unencrypted traffic, so can't be accessed
    with kAFS.  Set the AF_RXRPC security level to encrypt client calls to deal
    with this.
    
    Note that incoming service calls are set by the remote client and so aren't
    affected by this.
    
    This requires an AF_RXRPC patch to pass the value set by setsockopt to calls
    begun by the kernel.

    [ Upstream commit f9c1bba3d392843f046d2ee27b4dfcec989d8a4b ]
    
    The code that looks up servers by addresses makes the assumption
    that the list of addresses for a server is sorted.  It exits the
    loop if it finds that the target address is larger than the
    current candidate.  As the list is not currently sorted, this
    can lead to a failure to find a matching server, which can cause
    callbacks from that server to be ignored.
    
    Remove the early exit case so that the complete list is searched.

    [ Upstream commit 3d9fa91161387ee629e7a07c47934d119910c8ae ]
    
    If a volume location record lists multiple file servers for a volume, then
    it's possible that due to a misconfiguration or a changing configuration
    that one of the file servers doesn't know about it yet and will abort
    VNOVOL.  Currently, the rotation algorithm will stop with EREMOTEIO.
    
    Fix this by moving on to try the next server if VNOVOL is returned.  Once
    all the servers have been tried and the record rechecked, the algorithm
    will stop with EREMOTEIO or ENOMEDIUM.

    afs: Fix refcounting in callback registration
    
    [ Upstream commit d4a96bec7a7362834ef5c31d7b2cc9bf36eb0570 ]
    
    The refcounting on afs_cb_interest struct objects in
    afs_register_server_cb_interest() is wrong as it uses the server list
    entry's call back interest pointer without regard for the fact that it
    might be replaced at any time and the object thrown away.
    
    Fix this by:
    
     (1) Put a lock on the afs_server_list struct that can be used to
         mediate access to the callback interest pointers in the servers array.

    afs: Fix address list parsing
    
    [ Upstream commit 01fd79e6de74a447c5657913a335d9ce6508cdb1 ]
    
    The parsing of port specifiers in the address list obtained from the DNS
    resolution upcall doesn't work as in4_pton() and in6_pton() will fail on
    encountering an unexpected delimiter (in this case, the '+' marking the
    port number).  However, in*_pton() can't be given multiple specifiers.
    
    Fix this by finding the delimiter in advance and not relying on in*_pton()
    to find the end of the address for us.

    [ Upstream commit 3488a600d90bcaf061b104dbcfbdc8d99b398312 ]
    
    Protection key 0 is the default key for all memory and will
    not normally come back from pkey_alloc().  But, you might
    still want pass it to mprotect_pkey().
    
    This check ensures that you can use pkey 0.

    This makes it possible to to tell what 'prot' a given allocation
    is supposed to have.  That way, if we want to change just the
    pkey, we know what 'prot' to pass to mprotect_pkey().
    
    Also, keep a record of the most recent allocation so the tests
    can easily find it.

    We dump out the entire area of the siginfo where the si_pkey_ptr is
    supposed to be.  But, we do some math on the poitner, which is a u32.
    We intended to do byte math, not u32 math on the pointer.
    
    Cast it over to a u8* so it works.
    
    Also, move this block of code to below th si_code check.  It doesn't
    hurt anything, but the si_pkey field is gibberish for other signal
    types.

    [ Upstream commit f50b4878329ab61d8e05796f655adeb6f5fb57c6 ]
    
    In our "exhaust all pkeys" test, we make sure that there
    is the expected number available.  Turns out that the
    test did not cover the execute-only key, but discussed
    it anyway.  It did *not* discuss the test-allocated
    key.
    
    Now that we have a test for the mprotect(PROT_EXEC) case,
    this off-by-one issue showed itself.  Correct the off-by-
    one and add the explanation for the case we missed.

    [ Upstream commit a50093d60464dd51d1ae0c2267b0abe9e1de77f3 ]
    
    There is some noisy debug code at the end of the signal handler.  It was
    disabled by an early, unconditional "return".  However, that return also
    hid a dprint_in_signal=0, which kept dprint_in_signal=1 and effectively
    locked us into permanent dprint_in_signal=1 behavior.
    
    Remove the return and the dead code, fixing dprint_in_signal.

    [ Upstream commit 55556b0b2016806b2e16a20b62d143383983a34a ]
    
    do_not_expect_pk_fault() is a helper that we call when we do not expect
    a PK fault to have occurred.  But, it is a function, which means that
    it obscures the line numbers from pkey_assert().  It also gives no
    details.
    
    Replace it with an implementation that gives nice line numbers and
    also lets callers pass in a more descriptive message about what
    happened that caused the unexpected fault.

    uprobes/x86: Prohibit probing on MOV SS instruction
    
    [ Upstream commit 13ebe18c94f5b0665c01ae7fad2717ae959f4212 ]
    
    Since MOV SS and POP SS instructions will delay the exceptions until the
    next instruction is executed, single-stepping on it by uprobes must be
    prohibited.
    
    uprobe already rejects probing on POP SS (0x1f), but allows probing on MOV
    SS (0x8e and reg == 2).  This checks the target instruction and if it is
    MOV SS or POP SS, returns -ENOTSUPP to reject probing.

    kprobes/x86: Prohibit probing on exception masking instructions
    
    [ Upstream commit ee6a7354a3629f9b65bc18dbe393503e9440d6f5 ]
    
    Since MOV SS and POP SS instructions will delay the exceptions until the
    next instruction is executed, single-stepping on it by kprobes must be
    prohibited.
    
    However, kprobes usually executes those instructions directly on trampoline
    buffer (a.k.a. kprobe-booster), except for the kprobes which has
    post_handler. Thus if kprobe user probes MOV SS with post_handler, it will
    do single-stepping on the MOV SS.
    
    This means it is safe that if it is used via ftrace or perf/bpf since those
    don't use the post_handler.
    
    Anyway, since the stack switching is a rare case, it is safer just
    rejecting kprobes on such instructions.

    ocfs2: take inode cluster lock before moving reflinked inode from orphan dir
    
    [ Upstream commit e4383029201470523c3ffe339bd7d57e9b4a7d65 ]
    
    While reflinking an inode, we create a new inode in orphan directory,
    then take EX lock on it, reflink the original inode to orphan inode and
    release EX lock.  Once the lock is released another node could request
    it in EX mode from ocfs2_recover_orphans() which causes downconvert of
    the lock, on this node, to NL mode.
    
    Later we attempt to initialize security acl for the orphan inode and
    move it to the reflink destination.  However, while doing this we dont
    take EX lock on the inode.  This could potentially cause problems
    because we could be starting transaction, accessing journal and
    modifying metadata of the inode while holding NL lock and with another
    node holding EX lock on the inode.
    
    Fix this by taking orphan inode cluster lock in EX mode before
    initializing security and moving orphan inode to reflink destination.
    Use the __tracker variant while taking inode lock to avoid recursive
    locking in the ocfs2_init_security_and_acl() call chain.

    proc/kcore: don't bounds check against address 0
    
    [ Upstream commit 3955333df9a50e8783d115613a397ae55d905080 ]
    
    The existing kcore code checks for bad addresses against __va(0) with
    the assumption that this is the lowest address on the system.  This may
    not hold true on some systems (e.g.  arm64) and produce overflows and
    crashes.  Switch to using other functions to validate the address range.
    
    It's currently only seen on arm64 and it's not clear if anyone wants to
    use that particular combination on a stable release.  So this is not
    urgent for stable.

    init: fix false positives in W+X checking
    
    [ Upstream commit ae646f0b9ca135b87bc73ff606ef996c3029780a ]
    
    load_module() creates W+X mappings via __vmalloc_node_range() (from
    layout_and_allocate()->move_module()->module_alloc()) by using
    PAGE_KERNEL_EXEC.  These mappings are later cleaned up via
    "call_rcu_sched(&freeinit->rcu, do_free_init)" from do_init_module().
    
    This is a problem because call_rcu_sched() queues work, which can be run
    after debug_checkwx() is run, resulting in a race condition.  If hit,
    the race results in a nasty splat about insecure W+X mappings, which
    results in a poor user experience as these are not the mappings that
    debug_checkwx() is intended to catch.
    
    This issue is observed on multiple arm64 platforms, and has been
    artificially triggered on an x86 platform.
    
    Address the race by flushing the queued work before running the
    arch-defined mark_rodata_ro() which then calls debug_checkwx().

    test_find_first_bit() is intentionally sub-optimal, and may cause soft
    lockup due to long time of run on some systems.  So decrease length of
    bitmap to traverse to avoid lockup.
    
    With the change below, time of test execution doesn't exceed 0.2 seconds
    on my testing system.

    The caller calls action's ->init() and passes pointer to "struct tc_action *a",
    which later may be initialized to point at the existing action, otherwise
    "struct tc_action *a" is still invalid, and therefore dereferencing it is an
    error as happens in tcf_idr_release, where refcnt is decremented.
    
    So in case of missing flags tcf_idr_release must be called only for
    existing actions.

    ixgbe: fix memory leak on ipsec allocation

    The error clean up path kfree's adapter->ipsec and should be
    instead kfree'ing ipsec. Fix this.  Also, the err1 error exit path
    does not need to kfree ipsec because this failure path was for
    the failed allocation of ipsec.

    Commit 0fa1c579349f ("of/fdt: use memblock_virt_alloc for early alloc")
    inadvertently switched the DT unflattening allocations from memblock to
    bootmem which doesn't work because the unflattening happens before
    bootmem is initialized. Swapping the order of bootmem init and
    unflattening could also fix this, but removing bootmem is desired. So
    enable NO_BOOTMEM on SH like other architectures have done.

    perf cs-etm: Support unknown_thread in cs_etm_auxtrace
    
    [ Upstream commit 46d53620044f7b574c0f3216f8b4f2ce3559ce31 ]
    
    CoreSight doesn't allocate thread structure for unknown_thread in ETM
    auxtrace, so unknown_thread is NULL pointer.  If the perf data doesn't
    contain valid tid and then cs_etm__mem_access() uses unknown_thread
    instead as thread handler, this results in a segmentation fault when
    thread__find_addr_map() accesses the thread handler.
    
    This commit creates a new thread data which is used by unknown_thread, so
    CoreSight tracing can roll back to use unknown_thread if perf data
    doesn't include valid thread info.  This commit also releases thread
    data for initialization failure case and for normal auxtrace free flow.

    The IP increment should be done after the hypercall emulation, after
    calling the various handlers. In this way, these handlers can accurately
    identify the the IP of the VMCALL if they need it.
    
    This patch keeps the same functionality for the Hyper-V handler which does
    not use the return code of the standard kvm_skip_emulated_instruction()

    KVM: Extend MAX_IRQ_ROUTES to 4096 for all archs
    
    [ Upstream commit ddc9cfb79c1096a0855839631c091aa7e9602052 ]
    
    Our virtual machines make use of device assignment by configuring
    12 NVMe disks for high I/O performance. Each NVMe device has 129
    MSI-X Table entries:
    Capabilities: [50] MSI-X: Enable+ Count=129 Masked-Vector table: BAR=0 offset=00002000
    The windows virtual machines fail to boot since they will map the number of
    MSI-table entries that the NVMe hardware reported to the bus to msi routing
    table, this will exceed the 1024. This patch extends MAX_IRQ_ROUTES to 4096
    for all archs, in the future this might be extended again if needed.

    [ Upstream commit f2aeed3a591ff29a82495eeaa92ac4780bad7487 ]
    
    AF_RXRPC tries to turn on IP_RECVERR and IP_MTU_DISCOVER on the UDP socket
    it just opened for communications with the outside world, regardless of the
    type of socket.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work with an AF_INET6 socket.

    socket is of the AF_INET6 family.
    
    Without this, kAFS server and address rotation doesn't work correctly
    because the algorithm doesn't detect received network errors.

    rxrpc: Fix missing start of call timeout
    
    [ Upstream commit c54e43d752c7187595c8c62a231e0b0d53c7fded ]
    
    The expect_rx_by call timeout is supposed to be set when a call is started
    to indicate that we need to receive a packet by that point.  This is
    currently put back every time we receive a packet, but it isn't started
    when we first send a packet.  Without this, the call may wait forever if
    the server doesn't deign to reply.
    
    Fix this by setting the timeout upon a successful UDP sendmsg call for the
    first DATA packet.  The timeout is initiated only for initial transmission
    and not for subsequent retries as we don't want the retry mechanism to
    extend the timeout indefinitely.

    cifs: smb2ops: Fix listxattr() when there are no EAs
    
    [ Upstream commit ae2cd7fb478b8da707906ee1706ae1379968a8f9 ]
    
    As per listxattr(2):
    
           On success, a nonnegative number is returned indicating the size
           of the extended attribute name list.  On failure, -1 is returned
           and errno  is set appropriately.
    
    In SMB1, when the server returns an empty EA list through a listxattr(),
    it will correctly return 0 as there are no EAs for the given file.
    
    However, in SMB2+, it returns -ENODATA in listxattr() which is wrong since
    the request and response were sent successfully, although there's no actual
    EA for the given file.
    
    This patch fixes listxattr() for SMB2+ by returning 0 in cifs_listxattr()
    when the server returns an empty list of EAs.

    cifs: Allocate validate negotiation request through kmalloc
    
    [ Upstream commit 2796d303e3c5ec213c578ed3a66872205c126eb8 ]
    
    The data buffer allocated on the stack can't be DMA'ed, ib_dma_map_page will
    return an invalid DMA address for a buffer on stack. Even worse, this
    incorrect address can't be detected by ib_dma_mapping_error. Sending data
    from this address to hardware will not fail, but the remote peer will get
    junk data.
    
    Fix this by allocating the request on the heap in smb3_validate_negotiate.

    Removed duplicated code on freeing buffers on function exit.

    can: dev: increase bus-off message severity
    
    [ Upstream commit 71c23a821c6bcacba71a094efe49ee689605906b ]
    
    bus-off is usually caused by hardware malfunction or configuration error
    (baud rate mismatch) and causes a complete loss of communication.
    
    Increase the "bus-off" message's severity from netdev_dbg() to
    netdev_info() to make it visible to the user.
    
    A can interface going into bus-off is similar in severity to ethernet's
    "Link is Down" message, which is also printed at info level.
    
    It is debatable whether the the "restarted" message should also be
    changed to netdev_info() to make the interface state changes
    comprehensible from the kernel log. I have chosen to keep the
    "restarted" message at dbg for now as the "bus-off" message should be
    enough for the user to notice and investigate the problem.

    This was originally mistakenly submitted to net-next. Resubmitting to net.
    
    The comparison of numvecs < 0 is always false because numvecs is a u32
    and hence the error return from a failed call to pci_alloc_irq_vectores
    is never detected.  Fix this by using the signed int ret to handle the
    error return and assign numvecs to err.

    During boot, the HYPERVISOR_shared_info page gets remapped to make it work
    with KASLR. This means that any pointer derived from it needs to be
    adjusted.
    
    The only value that this applies to is the vcpu_info pointer for VCPU 0.
    For PV and HVM with the callback vector feature, this gets done via the
    smp_ops prepare_boot_cpu callback. Older Xen versions do not support the
    HVM callback vector, so there is no Xen-specific smp_ops set up in that
    scenario. So, the vcpu_info pointer for VCPU 0 never gets set to the proper
    value, and the first reference of it will be bad. Fix this by resetting it
    immediately after the remap.

    Since commit d677a4d60193 ("Makefile: support flag

      CONFIG_KCOV=y

      Your compiler does not support -fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc
      Your compiler does not support -fsanitize-coverage=trace-cmp
    
    Under this condition, $(CFLAGS_KCOV) is not empty but contains a
    space, so the following ifeq-conditional is false.
    
        ifeq ($(CFLAGS_KCOV),)
    
    Then, scripts/Makefile.gcc-plugins misses to add sancov_plugin.so to
    gcc-plugin-y while the SANCOV plugin is necessary as an alternative
    means.

    sched/core: Introduce set_special_state()
    
    [ Upstream commit b5bf9a90bbebffba888c9144c5a8a10317b04064 ]
    
    Gaurav reported a perceived problem with TASK_PARKED, which turned out
    to be a broken wait-loop pattern in __kthread_parkme(), but the
    reported issue can (and does) in fact happen for states that do not do
    condition based sleeps.
    
    When the 'current->state = TASK_RUNNING' store of a previous
    (concurrent) try_to_wake_up() collides with the setting of a 'special'
    sleep state, we can loose the sleep state.
    
    Normal condition based wait-loops are immune to this problem, but for
    sleep states that are not condition based are subject to this problem.
    
    There already is a fix for TASK_DEAD. Abstract that and also apply it
    to TASK_STOPPED and TASK_TRACED, both of which are also without
    condition based wait-loop.

    spi: bcm2835aux: ensure interrupts are enabled for shared handler
    
    [ Upstream commit bc519d9574618e47a0c788000fb78da95e18d953 ]
    
    The BCM2835 AUX SPI has a shared interrupt line (with AUX UART).
    Downstream fixes this with an AUX irqchip to demux the IRQ sources and a
    DT change which breaks compatibility with older kernels. The AUX irqchip
    was already rejected for upstream[1] and the DT change would break
    working systems if the DTB is updated to a newer one. The latter issue
    was brought to my attention by Alex Graf.
    
    The root cause however is a bug in the shared handler. Shared handlers
    must check that interrupts are actually enabled before servicing the
    interrupt. Add a check that the TXEMPTY or IDLE interrupts are enabled.

    [ Upstream commit 9aa169213d1166d30ae357a44abbeae93459339d ]
    
    When commit [1] was added, SGID was queried to derive the SMAC address.
    Then, later on during a refactor [2], SMAC was no longer needed. However,
    the now useless GID query remained.  Then during additional code changes
    later on, the GID query was being done in such a way that it caused iWARP
    queries to start breaking.  Remove the useless GID query and resolve the
    iWARP breakage at the same time.
    
    This is discussed in [3].

    IB/mlx4: Fix integer overflow when calculating optimal MTT size
    
    [ Upstream commit b03bcde962606d2ee59a4e9dd470db9ad53c5418 ]
    
    When the kernel was compiled using the UBSAN option,
    we saw the following stack trace:
    
    [ 1184.827917] UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx4/mr.c:349:27
    [ 1184.828114] signed integer overflow:
    [ 1184.828247] -2147483648 - 1 cannot be represented in type 'int'
    
    The problem was caused by calling round_up in procedure
    mlx4_ib_umem_calc_optimal_mtt_size (on line 349, as noted in the stack
    trace) with the second parameter (1 << block_shift) (which is an int).
    The second parameter should have been (1ULL << block_shift) (which
    is an unsigned long long).
    
    (1 << block_shift) is treated by the compiler as an int (because 1 is
    an integer).
    
    Now, local variable block_shift is initialized to 31.
    If block_shift is 31, 1 << block_shift is 1 << 31 = 0x80000000=-214748368.
    This is the most negative int value.
    
    Inside the round_up macro, there is a cast applied to ((1 << 31) - 1).
    However, this cast is applied AFTER ((1 << 31) - 1) is calculated.
    Since (1 << 31) is treated as an int, we get the negative overflow
    identified by UBSAN in the process of calculating ((1 << 31) - 1).
    
    The fix is to change (1 << block_shift) to (1ULL << block_shift) on
    line 349.

    IB/{hfi1, rdmavt}: Fix memory leak in hfi1_alloc_devdata() upon failure
    
    [ Upstream commit e9777ad4399c26c70318c4945f94efac2ed95391 ]
    
    When allocating device data, if there's an allocation failure, the
    already allocated memory won't be freed such as per-cpu counters.
    
    Fix memory leaks in exception path by creating a common reentrant
    clean up function hfi1_clean_devdata() to be used at driver unload
    time and device data allocation failure.
    
    To accomplish this, free_platform_config() and clean_up_i2c() are
    changed to be reentrant to remove dependencies when they are called
    in different order. This helps avoid NULL pointer dereferences
    introduced by this patch if those two functions weren't reentrant.
    
    In addition, set dd->int_counter, dd->rcv_limit,
    dd->send_schedule and dd->tx_opstats to NULL after they're freed in
    hfi1_clean_devdata(), so that hfi1_clean_devdata() is fully reentrant.

    usb: typec: tps6598x: handle block reads separately with plain-I2C adapters
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a2f474d328f292ee706414824ec4ca690cdf5ba ]
    
    If the I2C adapter that the PD controller is attached to
    does not support SMBus protocol, the driver needs to handle
    block reads separately. The first byte returned in block
    read protocol will show the total number of bytes. It needs
    to be stripped away.
    
    This is handled separately in the driver only because right
    now we have no way of requesting the used protocol with
    regmap-i2c. This is in practice a workaround for what is
    really a problem in regmap-i2c. The other option would have
    been to register custom regmap, or not use regmap at all,
    however, since the solution is very simple, I choose to use
    it in this case for convenience. It is easy to remove once
    we figure out how to handle this kind of cases in
    regmap-i2c.

    ARM: dts: correct missing "compatible" entry for ti81xx SoCs
    
    [ Upstream commit 647efef69de483f1dd7944ede31b4cae16acb124 ]
    
    The missing "compatible" entries are needed by drivers/clk/ti/clkctrl.c,
    and without them the structures initialized in drivers/clk/ti/clk-814x.c
    are not passed to configuration code. The result is a "not found from
    clkctrl data" error message, although boot proceeds anyway.
    
    The reason why the compatible is not found is because the board specific
    files override the SoC compatible without including it. This did not
    cause any issues until with the clkctrl nodes got introduced.
    
    Very lightly tested on a (lurching) AM3874 design that's in the middle
    of a kernel upgrade from TI's abandoned 2.6.37 tree.
    
    Also tested on j5eco-evm and hp-t410 to verify the clkctrl clocks are
    found.

    [ Upstream commit baf64250b4a513bf4ac226fd938692dc1836f4f6 ]
    
    The deferred_fiq handler used to limit hardware operations to IRQ
    unmask only, relying on gpio-omap assigned handler performing the ACKs.
    Since commit 80ac93c27441 ("gpio: omap: Fix lost edge interrupts") this
    is no longer the case as handle_edge_irq() has been replaced with
    handle_simmple_irq() which doesn't touch the hardware.
    
    Add single ACK operation per each active IRQ pin to the handler. While
    being at it, move unmask operation out of irq_counter loop so it is
    also called only once for each active IRQ pin.

    When CONFIG_NVME_MULTIPATH is set, but we're not using nvme to multipath,
    namespaces with multiple paths were not creating unique names due to

    This patch fixes this by falling back to the non-multipath naming method
    when the parameter disabled using multipath.

    iommu/vt-d: Fix usage of force parameter in intel_ir_reconfigure_irte()
    
    [ Upstream commit aa7528fe3576d11f4a10237178a723a1f080a547 ]
    
    It was noticed that the IRTE configured for guest OS kernel
    was over-written while the guest was running. As a result,
    vt-d Posted Interrupts configured for the guest are not being
    delivered directly, and instead bounces off the host. Every
    interrupt delivery takes a VM Exit.
    
    It was noticed that the following stack is doing the over-write:

    kthread, sched/wait: Fix kthread_parkme() completion issue
    
    [ Upstream commit 85f1abe0019fcb3ea10df7029056cf42702283a8 ]
    
    Even with the wait-loop fixed, there is a further issue with
    kthread_parkme(). Upon hotplug, when we do takedown_cpu(),
    smpboot_park_threads() can return before all those threads are in fact
    blocked, due to the placement of the complete() in __kthread_parkme().
    
    When that happens, sched_cpu_dying() -> migrate_tasks() can end up
    migrating such a still runnable task onto another CPU.
    
    Normally the task will have hit schedule() and gone to sleep by the
    time we do kthread_unpark(), which will then do __kthread_bind() to
    re-bind the task to the correct CPU.
    
    However, when we loose the initial TASK_PARKED store to the concurrent
    wakeup issue described previously, do the complete(), get migrated, it
    is possible to either:
    
     - observe kthread_unpark()'s clearing of SHOULD_PARK and terminate
       the park and set TASK_RUNNING, or
    
     - __kthread_bind()'s wait_task_inactive() to observe the competing
       TASK_RUNNING store.
    
    Either way the WARN() in __kthread_bind() will trigger and fail to
    correctly set the CPU affinity.
    
    Fix this by only issuing the complete() when the kthread has scheduled
    out. This does away with all the icky 'still running' nonsense.
    
    The alternative is to promote TASK_PARKED to a special state, this
    guarantees wait_task_inactive() cannot observe a 'stale' TASK_RUNNING
    and we'll end up doing the right thing, but this preserves the whole
    icky business of potentially migating the still runnable thing.

    kthread, sched/wait: Fix kthread_parkme() wait-loop
    
    [ Upstream commit 741a76b350897604c48fb12beff1c9b77724dc96 ]
    
    Gaurav reported a problem with __kthread_parkme() where a concurrent
    try_to_wake_up() could result in competing stores to ->state which,
    when the TASK_PARKED store got lost bad things would happen.
    
    The comment near set_current_state() actually mentions this competing
    store, but only mentions the case against TASK_RUNNING. This same
    store, with different timing, can happen against a subsequent !RUNNING
    store.
    
    This normally is not a problem, because as per that same comment, the
    !RUNNING state store is inside a condition based wait-loop:
    
      for (;;) {
        set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
        if (!need_sleep)
          break;
        schedule();
      }
      __set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
    
    If we loose the (first) TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE store to a previous
    (concurrent) wakeup, the schedule() will NO-OP and we'll go around the
    loop once more.
    
    The problem here is that the TASK_PARKED store is not inside the
    KTHREAD_SHOULD_PARK condition wait-loop.
    
    There is a genuine issue with sleeps that do not have a condition;
    this is addressed in a subsequent patch.

    stop_machine, sched: Fix migrate_swap() vs. active_balance() deadlock

            stop_one_cpu(1)
              spin_lock(stopper1->lock) -- waits for stopper lock
    
    Fix this deadlock by taking the wakeups out from under stopper->lock.
    This allows the active_balance() to queue the stop work and finish the
    context switch, which in turn allows the wakeup from migrate_swap() to
    observe the context and complete the wakeup.

    bpf, x64: fix memleak when not converging on calls
    
    [ Upstream commit 39f56ca945af86112753646316c4c92dcd4acd82 ]
    
    The JIT logic in jit_subprogs() is as follows: for all subprogs we
    allocate a bpf_prog_alloc(), populate it (prog->is_func = 1 here),
    and pass it to bpf_int_jit_compile(). If a failure occurred during
    JIT and prog->jited is not set, then we bail out from attempting to
    JIT the whole program, and punt to the interpreter instead. In case
    JITing went successful, we fixup BPF call offsets and do another
    pass to bpf_int_jit_compile() (extra_pass is true at that point) to
    complete JITing calls. Given that requires to pass JIT context around
    addrs and jit_data from x86 JIT are freed in the extra_pass in
    bpf_int_jit_compile() when calls are involved (if not, they can
    be freed immediately). However, if in the original pass, the JIT
    image didn't converge then we leak addrs and jit_data since image
    itself is NULL, the prog->is_func is set and extra_pass is false
    in that case, meaning both will become unreachable and are never
    cleaned up, therefore we need to free as well on !image. Only x64
    JIT is affected.

    While reviewing x64 JIT code, I noticed that we leak the prior allocated

    Prior to the commit e0ee9c12157d ("x86: bpf_jit: fix two bugs in eBPF JIT
    compiler") we would just break out of the loop, and using the image as the
    JITed prog since it could only shrink in size anyway. After e0ee9c12157d,
    we would bail out to out_addrs label where we free addrs and jit_data but
    not the image coming from bpf_jit_binary_alloc().

    [ Upstream commit 83b9dc11312f48a561594a895672abb6cb2a2250 ]
    
    When we dropped the custom Linux GPIO translation it resulted that the
    IRQ numbers changed slightly as well. Normally this would be fine
    because everyone is expected to use controller relative GPIO numbers and
    ACPI GpioIo/GpioInt resources. However, there is a certain set of
    Intel_Strago based Chromebooks where i8042 keyboard controller IRQ
    number is hardcoded be 182 (this is corrected with newer coreboot but
    the older ones still have the hardcoded Linux IRQ number). Because of
    this hardcoded IRQ number keyboard on those systems accidentally broke
    again.
    
    Fix this by iteratively associating IRQ descriptors to the chip irqdomain
    so that there are no gaps on those systems. Other systems are not
    affected.

    [ Upstream commit a57ab96ef9dde231d4d46edba4d5f73720edc16a ]
    
    We already have memcpy_toio(), but not memset_io(), so let's
    add the obvious version to allow building an allmodconfig kernel
    without errors like
    
    drivers/gpu/drm/ttm/ttm_bo_util.c: In function 'ttm_bo_move_memcpy':

    Input: atmel_mxt_ts - fix the firmware update
    
    [ Upstream commit 068bdb67ef74df0ad1627b7247a163e3e252ac11 ]
    
    The automatic update mechanism will trigger an update if the
    info block CRCs are different between maxtouch configuration
    file (maxtouch.cfg) and chip.
    
    The driver compared the CRCs without retrieving the chip CRC,
    resulting always in a failure and firmware flashing action
    triggered. Fix this issue by retrieving the chip info block
    CRC before the check.
    
    Note that this solution has the benefit that by reading the
    information block and the object table into a contiguous region
    of memory, we can verify the checksum at probe time. This means
    we make sure that we are indeed talking to a chip that supports
    object protocol correctly.
    
    Using this patch on a kevin chromebook, the touchscreen and
    touchpad drivers are able to match the CRC:
    
      atmel_mxt_ts 3-004b: Family: 164 Variant: 14 Firmware V2.3.AA Objects: 40

    xprtrdma: Fix list corruption / DMAR errors during MR recovery
    
    [ Upstream commit 054f155721d7af1f343ed52bea246626d8450ca8 ]
    
    The ro_release_mr methods check whether mr->mr_list is empty.
    Therefore, be sure to always use list_del_init when removing an MR
    linked into a list using that field. Otherwise, when recovering from
    transport failures or device removal, list corruption can result, or
    MRs can get mapped or unmapped an odd number of times, resulting in
    IOMMU-related failures.
    
    In general this fix is appropriate back to v4.8. However, code
    changes since then make it impossible to apply this patch directly
    to stable kernels. The fix would have to be applied by hand or
    reworked for kernels earlier than v4.16.
    
    Backport guidance -- there are several cases:
    - When creating an MR, initialize mr_list so that using list_empty
      on an as-yet-unused MR is safe.
    - When an MR is being handled by the remote invalidation path,
      ensure that mr_list is reinitialized when it is removed from
      rl_registered.
    - When an MR is being handled by rpcrdma_destroy_mrs, it is removed
      from mr_all, but it may still be on an rl_registered list. In
      that case, the MR needs to be removed from that list before being
      released.
    - Other cases are covered by using list_del_init in rpcrdma_mr_pop.

    IB/core: Make ib_mad_client_id atomic
    
    [ Upstream commit db82476f37413eaeff5f836a9d8b022d6544accf ]
    
    Currently, the kernel protects access to the agent ID allocator on a per
    port basis using a spinlock, so it is impossible for two apps/threads on
    the same port to get the same TID, but it is entirely possible for two
    threads on different ports to end up with the same TID.
    
    As this can be confusing (regardless of it being legal according to the
    IB Spec 1.3, C13-18.1.1, in section 13.4.6.4 - TransactionID usage),
    and as the rdma-core user space API for /dev/umad devices implies unique
    TIDs even across ports, make the TID an atomic type so that no two
    allocations, regardless of port number, will be the same.

    <linux/stringhash.h>: fix end_name_hash() for 64bit long
    
    [ Upstream commit 19b9ad67310ed2f685062a00aec602bec33835f0 ]
    
    The comment claims that this helper will try not to loose bits, but for
    64bit long it looses the high bits before hashing 64bit long into 32bit
    int.  Use the helper hash_long() to do the right thing for 64bit long.
    For 32bit long, there is no change.
    
    All the callers of end_name_hash() either assign the result to
    qstr->hash, which is u32 or return the result as an int value (e.g.
    full_name_hash()).  Change the helper return type to int to conform to
    its users.
    
    [ It took me a while to apply this, because my initial reaction to it
      was - incorrectly - that it could make for slower code.
    
      After having looked more at it, I take back all my complaints about
      the patch, Amir was right and I was mis-reading things or just being
      stupid.
    
      I also don't worry too much about the possible performance impact of
      this on 64-bit, since most architectures that actually care about
      performance end up not using this very much (the dcache code is the
      most performance-critical, but the word-at-a-time case uses its own
      hashing anyway).
    
      So this ends up being mostly used for filesystems that do their own
      degraded hashing (usually because they want a case-insensitive
      comparison function).
    
      A _tiny_ worry remains, in that not everybody uses DCACHE_WORD_ACCESS,
      and then this potentially makes things more expensive on 64-bit
      architectures with slow or lacking multipliers even for the normal
      case.
    
      That said, realistically the only such architecture I can think of is
      PA-RISC. Nobody really cares about performance on that, it's more of a
      "look ma, I've got warts^W an odd machine" platform.
    
      So the patch is fine, and all my initial worries were just misplaced
      from not looking at this properly.   - Linus ]

    In the above functions, if error occurs in the above functions or

    So it is not necessary to call kfree_skb in soft roce module again.
    Or else crash will occur.
    
    The steps to reproduce:
    
         server                       client
        ---------                    ---------
        |1.1.1.1|<----rxe-channel--->|1.1.1.2|
        ---------                    ---------
    
    On server: rping -s -a 1.1.1.1 -v -C 10000 -S 512
    On client: rping -c -a 1.1.1.1 -v -C 10000 -S 512
    
    The kernel configs CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK and
    CONFIG_DEBUG_OBJECTS are enabled on both server and client.
    
    When rping runs, run the following command in server:
    
    iptables -I OUTPUT -p udp  --dport 4791 -j DROP
    
    Without this patch, crash will occur.

    IB/rxe: add RXE_START_MASK for rxe_opcode IB_OPCODE_RC_SEND_ONLY_INV
    
    [ Upstream commit 2da36d44a9d54a2c6e1f8da1f7ccc26b0bc6cfec ]
    
    w/o RXE_START_MASK, the last_psn of IB_OPCODE_RC_SEND_ONLY_INV
    will not be updated in update_wqe_psn, and the corresponding
    wqe will not be acked in rxe_completer due to its last_psn is
    zero. Finally, the other wqe will also not be able to be acked,
    because the wqe of IB_OPCODE_RC_SEND_ONLY_INV with last_psn 0
    is still there. This causes large amount of io timeout when
    nvmeof is over rxe.
    
    Add RXE_START_MASK for IB_OPCODE_RC_SEND_ONLY_INV to fix this.

    RDMA/iwpm: fix memory leak on map_info
    
    [ Upstream commit f96416cea7bce9afe619c15e87fced70f93f9098 ]
    
    In the cases where iwpm_hash_bucket is NULL and where function
    get_mapinfo_hash_bucket returns NULL then the map_info is never added
    to hash_bucket_head and hence there is a leak of map_info. Fix this
    by nullifying hash_bucket_head and if that is null we know that
    that map_info was not added to hash_bucket_head and hence map_info
    should be free'd.

    RDMA/cma: Fix use after destroy access to net namespace for IPoIB
    
    [ Upstream commit 2918c1a900252b4a0c730715ec205437c7daf79d ]
    
    There are few issues with validation of netdevice and listen id lookup
    for IB (IPoIB) while processing incoming CM request as below.
    
    1. While performing lookup of bind_list in cma_ps_find(), net namespace
    of the netdevice can get deleted in cma_exit_net(), resulting in use
    after free access of idr and/or net namespace structures.
    This lookup occurs from the workqueue context (and not userspace
    context where net namespace is always valid).
    
               CPU0                              CPU1
               ====                              ====
    
     bind_list = cma_ps_find();
                                         move netdevice to new namespace
                                         delete net namespace
                                            cma_exit_net()
                                               idr_destroy(idr);
    
     [..]
     cma_find_listener(bind_list, ..);
    
    2. While netdevice is validated for IP address in given net namespace,
    netdevice's net namespace and/or ifindex can change in
    cma_get_net_dev() and cma_match_net_dev().
    
    Above issues are overcome by using rcu lock along with netdevice
    UP/DOWN state as described below.
    When a net namespace is getting deleted, netdevice is closed and
    shutdown before moving it back to init_net namespace.
    change_net_namespace() synchronizes with any existing use of netdevice
    before changing the netdev properties such as net or ifindex.
    Once netdevice IFF_UP flags is cleared, such fields are not guaranteed
    to be valid.
    Therefore, rcu lock along with netdevice state check ensures that,
    while route lookup and cm_id lookup is in progress, netdevice of
    interest won't migrate to any other net namespace.
    This ensures that associated net namespace of netdevice won't get
    deleted while rcu lock is held for netdevice which is in IFF_UP state.

    kvm: apic: Flush TLB after APIC mode/address change if VPIDs are in use
    
    [ Upstream commit a468f2dbf921d02f5107378501693137a812999b ]
    
    Currently, KVM flushes the TLB after a change to the APIC access page
    address or the APIC mode when EPT mode is enabled. However, even in
    shadow paging mode, a TLB flush is needed if VPIDs are being used, as
    specified in the Intel SDM Section 29.4.5.
    
    So replace vmx_flush_tlb_ept_only() with vmx_flush_tlb(), which will
    flush if either EPT or VPIDs are in use.

    reset: uniphier: fix USB clock line for LD20
    
    [ Upstream commit e6914365fd280fce303a89b8a8d4529af5a2e0f9 ]
    
    For LD20, the bit 5 of the offset 0x200c turned out to be a USB3
    reset.  The hardware document says it is the GIO reset despite LD20
    has no GIO bus, confusingly.
    
    Also, fix confusing comments for PXs3.

    Here the variable cont is used as the saved_pointer for a call to

    context however and the later reference is only ever used if
    the strtok_r is successful. But, 'gcc-5' at least doesn't have all
    this knowledge so initialize cont to NULL. Additionally, do the
    natural NULL check before accessing just for completness.

    [ Upstream commit daa2e3bdbb0b3e691cf20a042350817310cb8cb5 ]
    
    There is an issue(Errata Ref#226) that the SATA can not be
    detected via SATA Port-MultiPlayer(PMP) with following
    error log:
      ata1.15: PMP product ID mismatch
      ata1.15: SATA link up 6.0 Gbps (SStatus 133 SControl 300)
      ata1.15: Port Multiplier vendor mismatch '0x1b4b'!='0x0'
      ata1.15: PMP revalidation failed (errno=-19)
    
    After debugging, the reason is found that the value Port-x
    FIS-based Switching Control(PxFBS@0x40) become wrong.
    According to design, the bits[11:8, 0] of register PxFBS
    are cleared when Port Command and Status (0x18) bit[0]
    changes its value from 1 to 0, i.e. falling edge of Port
    Command and Status bit[0] sends PULSE that resets PxFBS
    bits[11:8; 0].
    So it needs a mvebu SATA WA to save the port PxFBS register
    before PxCMD ST write and restore it afterwards.
    
    This patch implements the WA in a separate function of
    ahci_mvebu_stop_engine to override ahci_stop_gngine.

    Marvell armada37xx, armada7k and armada8k share the same
    AHCI sata controller IP, and currently there is an issue
    (Errata Ref#226)that the SATA can not be detected via SATA
    Port-MultiPlayer(PMP). After debugging, the reason is
    found that the value of Port-x FIS-based Switching Control
    (PxFBS@0x40) became wrong.
    According to design, the bits[11:8, 0] of register PxFBS

    changes its value from 1 to 0, i.e. falling edge of Port

    bits[11:8; 0].
    So it needs save the port PxFBS register before PxCMD
    ST write and restore the port PxFBS register afterwards
    in ahci_stop_engine().
    
    This commit allows drivers to override ahci_stop_engine
    behavior for use by the Marvell AHCI driver(and potentially

    bpf, x64: fix JIT emission for dead code
    
    [ Upstream commit 1612a981b76688c598dc944bbfbe29a2b33e3973 ]
    
    Commit 2a5418a13fcf ("bpf: improve dead code sanitizing") replaced dead
    code with a series of ja-1 instructions, for safety. That made JIT
    compilation much more complex for some BPF programs. One instance of such
    programs is, for example:
    
    bool flag = false
    ...
    /* A bunch of other code */
    ...
    if (flag)
            do_something()
    
    In some cases llvm is not able to remove at compile time the code for
    do_something(), so the generated BPF program ends up with a large amount
    of dead instructions. In one specific real life example, there are two
    series of ~500 and ~1000 dead instructions in the program. When the
    verifier replaces them with a series of ja-1 instructions, it causes an
    interesting behavior at JIT time.
    
    During the first pass, since all the instructions are estimated at 64
    bytes, the ja-1 instructions end up being translated as 5 bytes JMP
    instructions (0xE9), since the jump offsets become increasingly large (>
    127) as each instruction gets discovered to be 5 bytes instead of the
    estimated 64.
    
    Starting from the second pass, the first N instructions of the ja-1
    sequence get translated into 2 bytes JMPs (0xEB) because the jump offsets
    become <= 127 this time. In particular, N is defined as roughly 127 / (5
    - 2) ~= 42. So, each further pass will make the subsequent N JMP
    instructions shrink from 5 to 2 bytes, making the image shrink every time.
    This means that in order to have the entire program converge, there need
    to be, in the real example above, at least ~1000 / 42 ~= 24 passes just
    for translating the dead code. If we add this number to the passes needed
    to translate the other non dead code, it brings such program to 40+
    passes, and JIT doesn't complete. Ultimately the userspace loader fails
    because such BPF program was supposed to be part of a prog array owner
    being JITed.
    
    While it is certainly possible to try to refactor such programs to help
    the compiler remove dead code, the behavior is not really intuitive and it
    puts further burden on the BPF developer who is not expecting such
    behavior. To make things worse, such programs are working just fine in all
    the kernel releases prior to the ja-1 fix.
    
    A possible approach to mitigate this behavior consists into noticing that
    for ja-1 instructions we don't really need to rely on the estimated size
    of the previous and current instructions, we know that a -1 BPF jump
    offset can be safely translated into a 0xEB instruction with a jump offset
    of -2.
    
    Such fix brings the BPF program in the previous example to complete again
    in ~9 passes.

    selftests: ftrace: Add a testcase for multiple actions on trigger
    
    [ Upstream commit 25aa50e0ca397a5e5d4d6fcecefa8107877d1dd0 ]
    
    Add a testcase for multiple actions with different
    parameters on an event trigger, which has been fixed
    by commit 192c283e93bd ("tracing: Add action comparisons
     when testing matching hist triggers").

    HID: lenovo: Add support for IBM/Lenovo Scrollpoint mice
    
    [ Upstream commit a230cd52b8a2be39cd6e9a13b3e62af57f21372a ]
    
    The IBM/Lenovo Scrollpoint mice feature a trackpoint-like stick instead of a
    scrolling wheel capable of 2-D (vertical+horizontal) scrolling.  hid-generic
    does only expose 1-D (vertical) scrolling functionality for these mice.  This
    patch adds support for horizontal scrolling for the IBM/Lenovo Scrollpoint mice
    to hid-lenovo.

    perf pmu: Fix core PMU alias list for X86 platform
    
    [ Upstream commit 292c34c10249c64a70def442f0d977bf9d466ed7 ]
    
    When counting uncore event with alias, core event is mistakenly
    involved, for example:
    
      perf stat --no-merge -e "unc_m_cas_count.all" -C0  sleep 1
    
      Performance counter stats for 'CPU(s) 0':
    
                     0      unc_m_cas_count.all [uncore_imc_4]
                     0      unc_m_cas_count.all [uncore_imc_2]
                     0      unc_m_cas_count.all [uncore_imc_0]
               153,640      unc_m_cas_count.all [cpu]
                     0      unc_m_cas_count.all [uncore_imc_5]
                25,026      unc_m_cas_count.all [uncore_imc_3]
                     0      unc_m_cas_count.all [uncore_imc_1]
    
           1.001447890 seconds time elapsed
    
    The reason is that current implementation doesn't check PMU name of a
    event when adding its alias into the alias list for core PMU. The
    uncore event aliases are mistakenly added.
    
    This bug was introduced in:
      commit 14b22ae028de ("perf pmu: Add helper function is_pmu_core to
      detect PMU CORE devices")
    
    Checking the PMU name for all PMUs on X86 and other architectures except
    ARM.
    There is no behavior change for ARM.

    arm64: only advance singlestep for user instruction traps
    
    [ Upstream commit 9478f1927e6ef9ef5e1ad761af1c98aa8e40b7f5 ]
    
    Our arm64_skip_faulting_instruction() helper advances the userspace
    singlestep state machine, but this is also called by the kernel BRK
    handler, as used for WARN*().
    
    Thus, if we happen to hit a WARN*() while the user singlestep state
    machine is in the active-no-pending state, we'll advance to the
    active-pending state without having executed a user instruction, and
    will take a step exception earlier than expected when we return to
    userspace.
    
    Let's fix this by only advancing the state machine when skipping a user
    instruction.

    RISC-V: build vdso-dummy.o with -no-pie
    
    [ Upstream commit 85602bea297fc4e5223adbf7006dcce9aa694f17 ]
    
    Debian toolcahin defaults to PIE, and I guess that will also be the case
    of most distributions. This causes the following build failure:
    
      AS      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/getcpu.o
      AS      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/flush_icache.o
      VDSOLD  arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso.so.dbg
      OBJCOPY arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso.so
      AS      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso.o
      VDSOLD  arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso-dummy.o
      LD      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso-syms.o
    riscv64-linux-gnu-ld: attempted static link of dynamic object `arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso-dummy.o'
    make[2]: *** [arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/Makefile:43: arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso-syms.o] Error 1
    make[1]: *** [scripts/Makefile.build:575: arch/riscv/kernel/vdso] Error 2
    make: *** [Makefile:1018: arch/riscv/kernel] Error 2
    
    While the root Makefile correctly passes "-fno-PIE" to build individual
    object files, the RISC-V kernel also builds vdso-dummy.o as an
    executable, which is therefore linked as PIE. Fix that by updating this
    specific link rule to also include "-no-pie".

    igb: Fix the transmission mode of queue 0 for Qav mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 2707df9773cd2cb8b0f35b8592431b301da9d352 ]
    
    When Qav mode is enabled, queue 0 should be kept on Stream Reservation
    mode. From the i210 datasheet, section 8.12.19:
    
    "Note: Queue0 QueueMode must be set to 1b when TransmitMode is set to
    Qav." ("QueueMode 1b" represents the Stream Reservation mode)
    
    The solution is to give queue 0 the all the credits it might need, so
    it has priority over queue 1.
    
    A situation where this can happen is when cbs is "installed" only on
    queue 1, leaving queue 0 alone. For example:
    
    $ tc qdisc replace dev enp2s0 handle 100: parent root mqprio num_tc 3 \
               map 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 queues 1@0 1@1 2@2 hw 0
    
    $ tc qdisc replace dev enp2s0 parent 100:2 cbs locredit -1470 \

    ACPI / watchdog: Prefer iTCO_wdt on Lenovo Z50-70
    
    [ Upstream commit a0a37862a4e1844793d39aca9ccb8fecbdcb8659 ]
    
    WDAT table on Lenovo Z50-70 is using RTC SRAM (ports 0x70 and 0x71) to
    store state of the timer. This conflicts with Linux RTC driver
    (rtc-cmos.c) who fails to reserve those ports for itself preventing RTC
    from functioning. In addition the WDAT table seems not to be fully
    functional because it does not reset the system when the watchdog times
    out.
    
    On this system iTCO_wdt works just fine so we simply prefer to use it
    instead of WDAT. This makes RTC working again and also results working
    watchdog via iTCO_wdt.

    powerpc/powernv/memtrace: Let the arch hotunplug code flush cache
    
    [ Upstream commit 7fd6641de28fe9b5bce0c38d2adee0a72a72619e ]
    
    Don't do this via custom code, instead now that we have support in the
    arch hotplug/hotunplug code, rely on those routines to do the right
    thing.
    
    The existing flush doesn't work because it uses ppc64_caches.l1d.size
    instead of ppc64_caches.l1d.line_size.

    ACPI / scan: Initialize watchdog before PNP
    
    [ Upstream commit cc6a0e315a68e5db85bea347b0c5b0fe4a9a5904 ]
    
    At least on one Dell system the PNP motherboard resources device
    includes resources used by WDAT table. Since PNP gets initialized before
    WDAT it results following error and no watchdog:
    
      platform wdat_wdt: failed to claim resource 3: [io  0x046a-0x046c]
      ACPI: watchdog: Device creation failed: -16
    
    Now, the PNP system driver is already accustomed with the situation that
    it cannot reserve all those motherboard resources because drivers using
    those might have reserved them already. In addition putting WDAT table
    resources under motherboard resources device makes sense in general.
    
    Fix this by initializing WDAT right before PNP. This allows WDAT to
    reserve all its resources and still keeps PNP system driver happy.

    s390/qeth: fix request-side race during cmd IO timeout
    
    [ Upstream commit db71bbbd11a4d314f0fa3fbf3369b71cf33ce33c ]
    
    Submitting a cmd IO request (usually on the WRITE device, but for IDX
    also on the READ device) is currently done with ccw_device_start()
    and a manual timeout in the caller.
    On timeout, the caller cleans up the related resources (eg. IO buffer).
    But 1) the IO might still be active and utilize those resources, and
        2) when the IO completes, qeth_irq() will attempt to clean up the
           same resources again.
    
    Instead of introducing additional resource locking, switch to
    ccw_device_start_timeout() to ensure IO termination after timeout, and
    let the IRQ handler alone deal with cleaning up after a request.
    
    This also removes a stray write->irq_pending reset from
    clear_ipacmd_list(). The routine doesn't terminate any pending IO on
    the WRITE device, so this should be handled properly via IO timeout
    in the IRQ handler.

    There is the following build error with CONFIG_TYPEC_UCSI=m, CONFIG_FTRACE=y
    and CONFIG_TRACING=n:
    
    ERROR: "__tracepoint_ucsi_command" [drivers/usb/typec/ucsi/typec_ucsi.ko] undefined!

    This compination is quite hard to create because CONFIG_TRACING gets selected
    only in rare cases without CONFIG_FTRACE.
    
    The build failure is caused by conditionally compiling trace.c depending on
    the wrong option CONFIG_FTRACE. Change this to depend on CONFIG_TRACING like
    other users of tracepoints do.

    kexec_file: do not add extra alignment to efi memmap
    
    [ Upstream commit a841aa83dff0af75c88aa846ba610a8af4c5ee21 ]
    
    Chun-Yi reported a kernel warning message below:
    
      WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at ../mm/early_ioremap.c:182 early_iounmap+0x4f/0x12c()
      early_iounmap(ffffffffff200180, 00000118) [0] size not consistent 00000120
    
    The problem is x86 kexec_file_load adds extra alignment to the efi
    memmap: in bzImage64_load():
    
            efi_map_sz = efi_get_runtime_map_size();
            efi_map_sz = ALIGN(efi_map_sz, 16);
    
    And __efi_memmap_init maps with the size including the alignment bytes
    but efi_memmap_unmap use nr_maps * desc_size which does not include the
    extra bytes.
    
    The alignment in kexec code is only needed for the kexec buffer internal
    use Actually kexec should pass exact size of the efi memmap to 2nd
    kernel.

    Commit 95846ecf9dac ("pid: replace pid bitmap implementation with IDR
    API") changed last field of /proc/loadavg (last pid allocated) to be off
    by one:
    
            # unshare -p -f --mount-proc cat /proc/loadavg
            0.00 0.00 0.00 1/60 2   <===
    
    It should be 1 after first fork into pid namespace.
    
    This is formally a regression but given how useless this field is I
    don't think anyone is affected.
    
    Bug was found by /proc testsuite!

    mm, pagemap: fix swap offset value for PMD migration entry
    
    [ Upstream commit 88c28f2469151b031f8cea9b28ed5be1b74a4172 ]
    
    The swap offset reported by /proc/<pid>/pagemap may be not correct for
    PMD migration entries.  If addr passed into pagemap_pmd_range() isn't
    aligned with PMD start address, the swap offset reported doesn't
    reflect this.  And in the loop to report information of each sub-page,
    the swap offset isn't increased accordingly as that for PFN.
    
    This may happen after opening /proc/<pid>/pagemap and seeking to a page
    whose address doesn't align with a PMD start address.  I have verified
    this with a simple test program.
    
    BTW: migration swap entries have PFN information, do we need to restrict
    whether to show them?

    scsi: isci: Fix infinite loop in while loop
    
    [ Upstream commit 4bc83b3f272fe8f36450f9c003df49cf07ffe5fd ]
    
    In the case when the phy_mask is bitwise anded with the phy_index bit is
    zero the continue statement currently jumps to the next iteration of the
    while loop and phy_index is never actually incremented, potentially
    causing an infinite loop if phy_index is less than SCI_MAX_PHS. Fix this
    by turning the while loop into a for loop.

    parisc: time: Convert read_persistent_clock() to read_persistent_clock64()
    
    [ Upstream commit f76cdd00ef0e39d880139b074e3b247594dff95a ]
    
    The read_persistent_clock() uses a timespec, which is not year 2038 safe
    on 32bit systems. On parisc architecture, we have implemented generic
    RTC drivers that can be used to compensate the system suspend time, but
    the RTC time can not represent the nanosecond resolution, so this patch
    just converts to read_persistent_clock64() with timespec64.

    afs: Fix server record deletion
    
    [ Upstream commit 660625922b3d9fcb376e5870299bc5c1086e1d32 ]
    
    AFS server records get removed from the net->fs_servers tree when
    they're deleted, but not from the net->fs_addresses{4,6} lists, which
    can lead to an oops in afs_find_server() when a server record has been
    removed, for instance during rmmod.
    
    Fix this by deleting the record from the by-address lists before posting
    it for RCU destruction.
    
    The reason this hasn't been noticed before is that the fileserver keeps
    probing the local cache manager, thereby keeping the service record
    alive, so the oops would only happen when a fileserver eventually gets
    bored and stops pinging or if the module gets rmmod'd and a call comes
    in from the fileserver during the window between the server records
    being destroyed and the socket being closed.
    
    The oops looks something like:
    
      BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 000000000000001c
      ...
      Workqueue: kafsd afs_process_async_call [kafs]

    net: hns: Avoid action name truncation
    
    [ Upstream commit f4ea89110df237da6fbcaab76af431e85f07d904 ]
    
    When longer interface names are used, the action names exposed in
    /proc/interrupts and /proc/irq/* maybe truncated. For example, when
    using the predictable name algorithm in systemd on a HiSilicon D05,
    I see:
    
      ubuntu@d05-3:~$  grep enahisic2i0-tx /proc/interrupts | sed 's/.* //'
      enahisic2i0-tx0
      enahisic2i0-tx1
      [...]
      enahisic2i0-tx8
      enahisic2i0-tx9
      enahisic2i0-tx1

      enahisic2i0-tx1
      enahisic2i0-tx1
      enahisic2i0-tx1
    
    Increase the max ring name length to allow for an interface name
    of IFNAMSIZE. After this change, I now see:
    
      $ grep enahisic2i0-tx /proc/interrupts | sed 's/.* //'
      enahisic2i0-tx0

    The initializing of q->root_blkg is currently outside of queue lock
    and rcu, so the blkg may be destroied before the initializing, which
    may cause dangling/null references. On the other side, the destroys
    of blkg are protected by queue lock or rcu. Put the initializing
    inside the queue lock and rcu to make it safer.

    drm/msm: Fix possible null dereference on failure of get_pages()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3976626ea3d2011f8fd3f3a47070a8b792018253 ]
    
    Commit 62e3a3e342af changed get_pages() to initialise
    msm_gem_object::pages before trying to initialise msm_gem_object::sgt,
    so that put_pages() would properly clean up pages in the failure
    case.
    
    However, this means that put_pages() now needs to check that
    msm_gem_object::sgt is not null before trying to clean it up, and
    this check was only applied to part of the cleanup code.  Move
    it all into the conditional block.  (Strictly speaking we don't
    need to make the kfree() conditional, but since we can't avoid
    checking for null ourselves we may as well do so.)

    scsi: iscsi: respond to netlink with unicast when appropriate
    
    [ Upstream commit af17092810a887178195276255b7b31f8fbe7dbe ]
    
    Instead of always multicasting responses, send a unicast netlink message
    directed at the correct pid.  This will be needed if we ever want to
    support multiple userspace processes interacting with the kernel over
    iSCSI netlink simultaneously.  Limitations can currently be seen if you
    attempt to run multiple iscsistart commands in parallel.
    
    We've fixed up the userspace issues in iscsistart that prevented
    multiple instances from running, so now attempts to speed up booting by
    bringing up multiple iscsi sessions at once in the initramfs are just
    running into misrouted responses that this fixes.

    tipc: fix infinite loop when dumping link monitor summary
    
    [ Upstream commit 36a50a989ee8267588de520b8704b85f045a3220 ]
    
    When configuring the number of used bearers to MAX_BEARER and issuing
    command "tipc link monitor summary", the command enters infinite loop
    in user space.
    
    This issue happens because function tipc_nl_node_dump_monitor() returns
    the wrong 'prev_bearer' value when all potential monitors have been
    scanned.
    
    The correct behavior is to always try to scan all monitors until either
    the netlink message is full, in which case we return the bearer identity
    of the affected monitor, or we continue through the whole bearer array
    until we can return MAX_BEARERS. This solution also caters for the case
    where there may be gaps in the bearer array.

    [ Upstream commit 458baa95c86406c81c6ebac0a98d1689075a3ec4 ]
    
    The USB configuration on GXM is slightly different than on GXL. The dwc3
    controller's internal hub has three USB2 ports (instead of 2 on GXL)
    along with a dedicated USB2 PHY for this port. However, it seems that
    there are no pins on GXM which would allow connecting the third port to
    a physical USB port.
    Passing the third PHY is required though, because without it none of the
    other USB ports is working (this seems to be a limitation of how the
    internal USB hub works, if one PHY is disabled then no USB port works).

    ARM64: dts: meson-gxl: add USB host support
    
    [ Upstream commit 8aec5fc1d4d881fe446addb94309efb39d4e5b23 ]
    
    This adds USB host support to the Meson GXL SoC. A dwc3 controller is
    used for host-mode, while a dwc2 controller (not added in this patch
    because I could not get it working) is used for device-mode only.
    
    The dwc3 controller's internal roothub has two USB2 ports enabled but no
    USB3 port. Each of the ports is supplied by a separate PHY. The USB pins
    are connected to the SoC's USBHOST_A and USBOTG_B pins.
    Due to the way the roothub works internally the USB PHYs are left
    enabled. When the dwc3 controller is disabled the PHY is never powered on
    so it does not draw any extra power. However, when the dwc3 host
    controller is enabled then all PHYs also have to be enabled, otherwise
    USB devices will not be detected (regardless of whether they are plugged
    into an enabled port or not). This means that only the dwc3 controller
    has to be enabled on boards with USB support (instead of requiring all
    boards to enable the PHYs additionally with the chance of forgetting to
    enable one and breaking all other ports with that as well).
    
    This also adds the USB3 PHY which currently only does some basic
    initialization. That however is required because without it high-speed
    devices (like USB thumb drives) do not work on some devices (probably
    because the bootloader does not configure the USB3 PHY registers).

    blkcg: don't hold blkcg lock when deactivating policy
    
    [ Upstream commit 946b81da114b8ba5c74bb01e57c0c6eca2bdc801 ]
    
    As described in the comment of blkcg_activate_policy(),
    *Update of each blkg is protected by both queue and blkcg locks so
    that holding either lock and testing blkcg_policy_enabled() is
    always enough for dereferencing policy data.*
    with queue lock held, there is no need to hold blkcg lock in
    blkcg_deactivate_policy(). Similar case is in
    blkcg_activate_policy(), which has removed holding of blkcg lock in

    arm64: kasan: avoid pfn_to_nid() before page array is initialized
    
    [ Upstream commit 800cb2e553d44541b83aa3ec45d9839385fe8ab6 ]
    
    In arm64's kasan_init(), we use pfn_to_nid() to find the NUMA node a

    Let's fix this by using early_pfn_to_nid(), as other architectures do in
    their kasan init code. Note that early_pfn_to_nid acquires the nid from
    the memblock array, which we iterate over in kasan_init(), so this
    should be fine.

    When vgic_prune_ap_list() finds an interrupt that needs to be migrated
    to a new VCPU, we should notify this VCPU of the pending interrupt,
    since it requires immediate action.
    Kick this VCPU once we have added the new IRQ to the list, but only
    after dropping the locks.

    powerpc/64s: Default l1d_size to 64K in RFI fallback flush
    
    [ Upstream commit 9dfbf78e4114fcaf4ef61c49885c3ab5bad40d0b ]
    
    If there is no d-cache-size property in the device tree, l1d_size could
    be zero. We don't actually expect that to happen, it's only been seen
    on mambo (simulator) in some configurations.
    
    A zero-size l1d_size leads to the loop in the asm wrapping around to
    2^64-1, and then walking off the end of the fallback area and
    eventually causing a page fault which is fatal.
    
    Just default to 64K which is correct on some CPUs, and sane enough to
    not cause a crash on others.

    Fix this by making the dummy functions return an error code (-ENOSYS)

    eCryptfs: don't pass up plaintext names when using filename encryption
    
    [ Upstream commit e86281e700cca8a773f9a572fa406adf2784ba5c ]
    
    Both ecryptfs_filldir() and ecryptfs_readlink_lower() use
    ecryptfs_decode_and_decrypt_filename() to translate lower filenames to
    upper filenames. The function correctly passes up lower filenames,
    unchanged, when filename encryption isn't in use. However, it was also
    passing up lower filenames when the filename wasn't encrypted or
    when decryption failed. Since 88ae4ab9802e, eCryptfs refuses to lookup
    lower plaintext names when filename encryption is enabled so this
    resulted in a situation where userspace would see lower plaintext
    filenames in calls to getdents(2) but then not be able to lookup those
    filenames.
    
    An example of this can be seen when enabling filename encryption on an
    eCryptfs mount at the root directory of an Ext4 filesystem:
    
    $ ls -1i /lower
    12 ECRYPTFS_FNEK_ENCRYPTED.FWYZD8TcW.5FV-TKTEYOHsheiHX9a-w.NURCCYIMjI8pn5BDB9-h3fXwrE--
    11 lost+found
    $ ls -1i /upper
    ls: cannot access '/upper/lost+found': No such file or directory
     ? lost+found
    12 test
    
    With this change, the lower lost+found dentry is ignored:
    
    $ ls -1i /lower
    12 ECRYPTFS_FNEK_ENCRYPTED.FWYZD8TcW.5FV-TKTEYOHsheiHX9a-w.NURCCYIMjI8pn5BDB9-h3fXwrE--
    11 lost+found
    $ ls -1i /upper
    12 test
    
    Additionally, some potentially noisy error/info messages in the related
    code paths are turned into debug messages so that the logs can't be
    easily filled.

    clk: honor CLK_MUX_ROUND_CLOSEST in generic clk mux
    
    [ Upstream commit 4ad69b80e886a845f56ce0a3d10211208693d92b ]
    
    CLK_MUX_ROUND_CLOSEST is part of the clk_mux documentation but clk_mux
    directly calls __clk_mux_determine_rate(), which overrides the flag.
    As result, if clk_mux is instantiated with CLK_MUX_ROUND_CLOSEST, the
    flag will be ignored and the clock rounded down.
    
    To solve this, this patch expose clk_mux_determine_rate_flags() in the
    clk-provider API and uses it in the determine_rate() callback of clk_mux.

    The change fixes a bit field overflow which allows to write to higher

    bit fields, the problem is reproduced if 'parent_rate' to 'spi_hz'
    ratio is greater than 1024, for instance
    
      p->min_div      = 2,
      MSO rate        = 33333333,
      SPI device rate = 10000
    
    results in
    
      k          = 5, i.e. BRDV = 0b100 or 1/32 prescaler output,
      BRPS       = 105,
      TSCR value = 0x6804, thus MSSEL and MSIMM bit fields are non-zero.

    isofs: fix potential memory leak in mount option parsing
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f34a5130a471f32f2fe7750769ab4057dc3eaa0 ]
    
    When specifying string type mount option (e.g., iocharset)
    several times in a mount, current option parsing may
    cause memory leak. Hence, call kfree for previous one
    in this case. Meanwhile, check memory allocation result
    for it.

    MIPS: io: Add barrier after register read in readX()
    
    [ Upstream commit a1cc7034e33d12dc17d13fbcd7d597d552889097 ]
    
    While a barrier is present in the writeX() functions before the register
    write, a similar barrier is missing in the readX() functions after the
    register read. This could allow memory accesses following readX() to
    observe stale data.

    fsnotify: fix ignore mask logic in send_to_group()
    
    [ Upstream commit 92183a42898dc400b89da35685d1814ac6acd3d8 ]
    
    The ignore mask logic in send_to_group() does not match the logic
    in fanotify_should_send_event(). In the latter, a vfsmount mark ignore
    mask precedes an inode mark mask and in the former, it does not.
    
    That difference may cause events to be sent to fanotify backend for no
    reason. Fix the logic in send_to_group() to match that of
    fanotify_should_send_event().

    perf report: Fix switching to another perf.data file
    
    [ Upstream commit 7b366142a50ad79e48de8e67c5b3e8cfb9fa82dd ]
    
    In the TUI the 's' hotkey can be used to switch to another perf.data
    file in the current directory, but that got broken in Fixes:
    b01141f4f59c ("perf annotate: Initialize the priv are in symbol__new()"),
    that would show this once another file was chosen:
    
        ┌─Fatal Error─────────────────────────────────────┐
        │Annotation needs to be init before symbol__init()│
        │                                                 │

        └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    
    Fix it by just silently bailing out if symbol__annotation_init() was already
    called, just like is done with symbol__init(), i.e. they are done just once at
    session start, not when switching to a new perf.data file.

    nfp: flower: split and limit cmsg skb lists
    
    [ Upstream commit cf2cbadc20f5651c3dde9f5ac2ee52fb43aa4ddd ]
    
    Introduce a second skb list for handling control messages and limit the
    number of allowed messages. Some control messages are considered more
    crucial than others, resulting in the need for a second skb list. By
    splitting the list into a separate high and low priority list we can
    ensure that messages on the high list get added to the head of the list
    that gets processed, this however has no functional impact. Previously
    there was no limit on the number of messages allowed on the queue, this
    could result in the queue growing boundlessly and eventually the host
    running out of memory.

    nfp: ignore signals when communicating with management FW
    
    [ Upstream commit 5496295aefe86995e41398b0f76de601308fc3f5 ]
    
    We currently allow signals to interrupt the wait for management FW
    commands.  Exiting the wait should not cause trouble, the FW will
    just finish executing the command in the background and new commands
    will wait for the old one to finish.
    
    However, this may not be what users expect (Ctrl-C not actually stopping
    the command).  Moreover some systems routinely request link information
    with signals pending (Ubuntu 14.04 runs a landscape-sysinfo python tool
    from MOTD) worrying users with errors like these:
    
    nfp 0000:04:00.0: nfp_nsp: Error -512 waiting for code 0x0007 to start
    nfp 0000:04:00.0: nfp: reading port table failed -512
    
    Make the wait for management FW responses non-interruptible.

    writeX() has strong ordering semantics with respect to memory updates.
    In the absence of a write barrier or a compiler barrier, the compiler
    can reorder register and memory update instructions. This breaks the

    x86: Add check for APIC access address for vmentry of L2 guests
    
    [ Upstream commit f0f4cf5b306620282db0c59ff963012e1973e025 ]
    
    According to the sub-section titled 'VM-Execution Control Fields' in the
    section titled 'Basic VM-Entry Checks' in Intel SDM vol. 3C, the following
    vmentry check must be enforced:
    
        If the 'virtualize APIC-accesses' VM-execution control is 1, the
        APIC-access address must satisfy the following checks:
    
            - Bits 11:0 of the address must be 0.
            - The address should not set any bits beyond the processor's
              physical-address width.
    
    This patch adds the necessary check to conform to this rule. If the check
    fails, we cause the L2 VMENTRY to fail which is what the associated unit
    test (following patch) expects.

    [ Upstream commit 90619eb1dc4f19357fef5e9c13c6c9beead0fd80 ]
    
    The split between ACPI and PCI platforms generated issues with randconfig:
    
    with SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM_PCI=y and
    SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM=m, we get this module link failure:
    
    ERROR: "sst_context_init"

    ERROR: "sst_configure_runtime_pm"
    [sound/soc/intel/atom/sst/snd-intel-sst-acpi.ko] undefined!
    
    To keep things simple, let's expose two configs for
    SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM_PCI and SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM_ACPI,
    which select a common SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM option. To avoid
    breaking existing solutions with the semantics change,
    SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM_ACPI uses "default ACPI" so that "make
    oldnoconfig" and "make olddefconfig" still work as expected.
    
    Also remove mentions of Medfield while we are at it since it was
    removed recently.
