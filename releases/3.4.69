    mm: fix aio performance regression for database caused by THP
    
    commit 7cb2ef56e6a8b7b368b2e883a0a47d02fed66911 upstream.
    
    I am working with a tool that simulates oracle database I/O workload.
    This tool (orion to be specific -
    <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e16638/iodesign.htm#autoId24>)
    allocates hugetlbfs pages using shmget() with SHM_HUGETLB flag.  It then
    does aio into these pages from flash disks using various common block
    sizes used by database.  I am looking at performance with two of the most
    common block sizes - 1M and 64K.  aio performance with these two block
    sizes plunged after Transparent HugePages was introduced in the kernel.
    Here are performance numbers:
    
                    pre-THP         2.6.39          3.11-rc5
    1M read         8384 MB/s       5629 MB/s       6501 MB/s
    64K read        7867 MB/s       4576 MB/s       4251 MB/s
    
    I have narrowed the performance impact down to the overheads introduced by
    THP in __get_page_tail() and put_compound_page() routines.  perf top shows
    >40% of cycles being spent in these two routines.  Every time direct I/O
    to hugetlbfs pages starts, kernel calls get_page() to grab a reference to
    the pages and calls put_page() when I/O completes to put the reference
    away.  THP introduced significant amount of locking overhead to get_page()
    and put_page() when dealing with compound pages because hugepages can be
    split underneath get_page() and put_page().  It added this overhead
    irrespective of whether it is dealing with hugetlbfs pages or transparent
    hugepages.  This resulted in 20%-45% drop in aio performance when using
    hugetlbfs pages.
    
    Since hugetlbfs pages can not be split, there is no reason to go through
    all the locking overhead for these pages from what I can see.  I added
    code to __get_page_tail() and put_compound_page() to bypass all the
    locking code when working with hugetlbfs pages.  This improved performance
    significantly.  Performance numbers with this patch:
    
                    pre-THP         3.11-rc5        3.11-rc5 + Patch
    1M read         8384 MB/s       6501 MB/s       8371 MB/s
    64K read        7867 MB/s       4251 MB/s       6510 MB/s
    
    Performance with 64K read is still lower than what it was before THP, but
    still a 53% improvement.  It does mean there is more work to be done but I
    will take a 53% improvement for now.
    
    Please take a look at the following patch and let me know if it looks
    reasonable.

    lib/scatterlist.c: don't flush_kernel_dcache_page on slab page
    
    commit 3d77b50c5874b7e923be946ba793644f82336b75 upstream.
    
    Commit b1adaf65ba03 ("[SCSI] block: add sg buffer copy helper
    functions") introduces two sg buffer copy helpers, and calls
    flush_kernel_dcache_page() on pages in SG list after these pages are
    written to.
    
    Unfortunately, the commit may introduce a potential bug:
    
     - Before sending some SCSI commands, kmalloc() buffer may be passed to
       block layper, so flush_kernel_dcache_page() can see a slab page
       finally
    
     - According to cachetlb.txt, flush_kernel_dcache_page() is only called
       on "a user page", which surely can't be a slab page.
    
     - ARCH's implementation of flush_kernel_dcache_page() may use page
       mapping information to do optimization so page_mapping() will see the
       slab page, then VM_BUG_ON() is triggered.
    
    Aaro Koskinen reported the bug on ARM/kirkwood when DEBUG_VM is enabled,
    and this patch fixes the bug by adding test of '!PageSlab(miter->page)'
    before calling flush_kernel_dcache_page().

    xtensa: don't use alternate signal stack on threads
    
    commit cba9a90053e3b7973eff4f1946f33032e98eeed5 upstream.
    
    According to create_thread(3): "The new thread does not inherit the creating
    thread's alternate signal stack". Since commit f9a3879a (Fix sigaltstack
    corruption among cloned threads), current->sas_ss_size is set to 0 for cloned
    processes sharing VM with their parent. Don't use the (nonexistent) alternate
    signal stack in this case. This has been broken since commit 29c4dfd9 ([XTENSA]
    Remove non-rt signal handling).

    Resolve this by ensuring that ASoC internal backend devices are not

    says it should be.

    parisc: Do not crash 64bit SMP kernels on machines with >= 4GB RAM
    
    commit 54e181e073fc1415e41917d725ebdbd7de956455 upstream.
    
    Since the beginning of the parisc-linux port, sometimes 64bit SMP kernels were
    not able to bring up other CPUs than the monarch CPU and instead crashed the
    kernel.  The reason was unclear, esp. since it involved various machines (e.g.
    J5600, J6750 and SuperDome). Testing showed, that those crashes didn't happened
    when less than 4GB were installed, or if a 32bit Linux kernel was booted.
    
    In the end, the fix for those SMP problems is trivial:
    During the early phase of the initialization of the CPUs, including the monarch
    CPU, the PDC_PSW firmware function to enable WIDE (=64bit) mode is called.
    It's documented that this firmware function may clobber various registers, and
    one one of those possibly clobbered registers is %cr30 which holds the task
    thread info pointer.
    
    Now, if %cr30 would always have been clobbered, then this bug would have been
    detected much earlier. But lots of testing finally showed, that - at least for
    %cr30 - on some machines only the upper 32bits of the 64bit register suddenly
    turned zero after the firmware call.
    
    So, after finding the root cause, the explanation for the various crashes
    became clear:
    - On 32bit SMP Linux kernels all upper 32bit were zero, so we didn't faced this
      problem.
    - Monarch CPUs in 64bit mode always booted sucessfully, because the inital task
      thread info pointer was below 4GB.
    - Secondary CPUs booted sucessfully on machines with less than 4GB RAM because
      the upper 32bit were zero anyay.
    - Secondary CPus failed to boot if we had more than 4GB RAM and the task thread
      info pointer was located above the 4GB boundary.
    
    Finally, the patch to fix this problem is trivial by saving the %cr30 register
    before the firmware call and restoring it afterwards.

    clockevents: Sanitize ticks to nsec conversion
    
    commit 97b9410643475d6557d2517c2aff9fd2221141a9 upstream.
    
    Marc Kleine-Budde pointed out, that commit 77cc982 "clocksource: use
    clockevents_config_and_register() where possible" caused a regression
    for some of the converted subarchs.
    
    The reason is, that the clockevents core code converts the minimal
    hardware tick delta to a nanosecond value for core internal
    usage. This conversion is affected by integer math rounding loss, so
    the backwards conversion to hardware ticks will likely result in a
    value which is less than the configured hardware limitation. The
    affected subarchs used their own workaround (SIGH!) which got lost in
    the conversion.
    
    The solution for the issue at hand is simple: adding evt->mult - 1 to
    the shifted value before the integer divison in the core conversion
    function takes care of it. But this only works for the case where for
    the scaled math mult/shift pair "mult <= 1 << shift" is true. For the
    case where "mult > 1 << shift" we can apply the rounding add only for
    the minimum delta value to make sure that the backward conversion is
    not less than the given hardware limit. For the upper bound we need to
    omit the rounding add, because the backwards conversion is always
    larger than the original latch value. That would violate the upper
    bound of the hardware device.
    
    Though looking closer at the details of that function reveals another
    bogosity: The upper bounds check is broken as well. Checking for a
    resulting "clc" value greater than KTIME_MAX after the conversion is
    pointless. The conversion does:
    
          u64 clc = (latch << evt->shift) / evt->mult;
    
    So there is no sanity check for (latch << evt->shift) exceeding the
    64bit boundary. The latch argument is "unsigned long", so on a 64bit
    arch the handed in argument could easily lead to an unnoticed shift
    overflow. With the above rounding fix applied the calculation before
    the divison is:
    
           u64 clc = (latch << evt->shift) + evt->mult - 1;
    
    So we need to make sure, that neither the shift nor the rounding add
    is overflowing the u64 boundary.
    
    [ukl: move assignment to rnd after eventually changing mult, fix build
     issue and correct comment with the right math]

    md: Fix skipping recovery for read-only arrays.
    
    commit 61e4947c99c4494336254ec540c50186d186150b upstream.
    
    Since:
            commit 7ceb17e87bde79d285a8b988cfed9eaeebe60b86
            md: Allow devices to be re-added to a read-only array.
    
    spares are activated on a read-only array. In case of raid1 and raid10
    personalities it causes that not-in-sync devices are marked in-sync
    without checking if recovery has been finished.
    
    If a read-only array is degraded and one of its devices is not in-sync
    (because the array has been only partially recovered) recovery will be skipped.
    
    This patch adds checking if recovery has been finished before marking a device
    in-sync for raid1 and raid10 personalities. In case of raid5 personality
    such condition is already present (at raid5.c:6029).
    
    Bug was introduced in 3.10 and causes data corruption.

    libata: make ata_eh_qc_retry() bump scmd->allowed on bogus failures
    
    commit f13e220161e738c2710b9904dcb3cf8bb0bcce61 upstream.
    
    libata EH decrements scmd->retries when the command failed for reasons
    unrelated to the command itself so that, for example, commands aborted
    due to suspend / resume cycle don't get penalized; however,
    decrementing scmd->retries isn't enough for ATA passthrough commands.
    
    Without this fix, ATA passthrough commands are not resend to the
    drive, and no error is signalled to the caller because:
    
    - allowed retry count is 1
    - ata_eh_qc_complete fill the sense data, so result is valid
    - sense data is filled with untouched ATA registers.

    can: flexcan: flexcan_chip_start: fix regression, mark one MB for TX and abort pending TX
    
    commit d5a7b406c529e4595ce03dc8f6dcf7fa36f106fa upstream.
    
    In patch
    
        0d1862e can: flexcan: fix flexcan_chip_start() on imx6
    
    the loop in flexcan_chip_start() that iterates over all mailboxes after the
    soft reset of the CAN core was removed. This loop put all mailboxes (even the
    ones marked as reserved 1...7) into EMPTY/INACTIVE mode. On mailboxes 8...63,
    this aborts any pending TX messages.
    
    After a cold boot there is random garbage in the mailboxes, which leads to
    spontaneous transmit of CAN frames during first activation. Further if the
    interface was disabled with a pending message (usually due to an error
    condition on the CAN bus), this message is retransmitted after enabling the
    interface again.
    
    This patch fixes the regression by:
    1) Limiting the maximum number of used mailboxes to 8, 0...7 are used by the RX
    FIFO, 8 is used by TX.
    2) Marking the TX mailbox as EMPTY/INACTIVE, so that any pending TX of that
    mailbox is aborted.

    mac80211: update sta->last_rx on acked tx frames
    
    commit 0c5b93290b2f3c7a376567c03ae8d385b0e99851 upstream.
    
    When clients are idle for too long, hostapd sends nullfunc frames for
    probing. When those are acked by the client, the idle time needs to be
    updated.
    
    To make this work (and to avoid unnecessary probing), update sta->last_rx
    whenever an ACK was received for a tx packet. Only do this if the flag
    IEEE80211_HW_REPORTS_TX_ACK_STATUS is set.

    mac80211: correctly close cancelled scans
    
    commit a754055a1296fcbe6f32de3a5eaca6efb2fd1865 upstream.
    
    __ieee80211_scan_completed is called from a worker. This
    means that the following flow is possible.
    
     * driver calls ieee80211_scan_completed
     * mac80211 cancels the scan (that is already complete)
     * __ieee80211_scan_completed runs
    
    When scan_work will finally run, it will see that the scan
    hasn't been aborted and might even trigger another scan on
    another band. This leads to a situation where cfg80211's
    scan is not done and no further scan can be issued.
    
    Fix this by setting a new flag when a HW scan is being
    cancelled so that no other scan will be triggered.
