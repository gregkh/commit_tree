    xfs: handle dquot buffer readahead in log recovery correctly
    
    commit 7d6a13f023567d573ac362502bb702eda716e654 upstream.
    
    When we do dquot readahead in log recovery, we do not use a verifier
    as the underlying buffer may not have dquots in it. e.g. the
    allocation operation hasn't yet been replayed. Hence we do not want
    to fail recovery because we detect an operation to be replayed has
    not been run yet. This problem was addressed for inodes in commit
    d891400 ("xfs: inode buffers may not be valid during recovery
    readahead") but the problem was not recognised to exist for dquots
    and their buffers as the dquot readahead did not have a verifier.
    
    The result of not using a verifier is that when the buffer is then
    next read to replay a dquot modification, the dquot buffer verifier
    will only be attached to the buffer if *readahead is not complete*.
    Hence we can read the buffer, replay the dquot changes and then add
    it to the delwri submission list without it having a verifier
    attached to it. This then generates warnings in xfs_buf_ioapply(),
    which catches and warns about this case.
    
    Fix this and make it handle the same readahead verifier error cases
    as for inode buffers by adding a new readahead verifier that has a
    write operation as well as a read operation that marks the buffer as
    not done if any corruption is detected.  Also make sure we don't run
    readahead if the dquot buffer has been marked as cancelled by
    recovery.
    
    This will result in readahead either succeeding and the buffer
    having a valid write verifier, or readahead failing and the buffer
    state requiring the subsequent read to resubmit the IO with the new
    verifier.  In either case, this will result in the buffer always
    ending up with a valid write verifier on it.
    
    Note: we also need to fix the inode buffer readahead error handling
    to mark the buffer with EIO. Brian noticed the code I copied from
    there wrong during review, so fix it at the same time. Add comments
    linking the two functions that handle readahead verifier errors
    together so we don't forget this behavioural link in future.

    xfs: print name of verifier if it fails
    
    commit 233135b763db7c64d07b728a9c66745fb0376275 upstream.
    
    This adds a name to each buf_ops structure, so that if
    a verifier fails we can print the type of verifier that
    failed it.  Should be a slight debugging aid, I hope.

    xfs: xfs_iflush_cluster fails to abort on error
    
    commit b1438f477934f5a4d5a44df26f3079a7575d5946 upstream.
    
    When a failure due to an inode buffer occurs, the error handling
    fails to abort the inode writeback correctly. This can result in the
    inode being reclaimed whilst still in the AIL, leading to
    use-after-free situations as well as filesystems that cannot be
    unmounted as the inode log items left in the AIL never get removed.
    
    Fix this by ensuring fatal errors from xfs_imap_to_bp() result in
    the inode flush being aborted correctly.

    xfs: Don't wrap growfs AGFL indexes
    
    commit ad747e3b299671e1a53db74963cc6c5f6cdb9f6d upstream.
    
    Commit 96f859d ("libxfs: pack the agfl header structure so
    XFS_AGFL_SIZE is correct") allowed the freelist to use the empty
    slot at the end of the freelist on 64 bit systems that was not
    being used due to sizeof() rounding up the structure size.
    
    This has caused versions of xfs_repair prior to 4.5.0 (which also
    has the fix) to report this as a corruption once the filesystem has
    been grown. Older kernels can also have problems (seen from a whacky
    container/vm management environment) mounting filesystems grown on a
    system with a newer kernel than the vm/container it is deployed on.
    
    To avoid this problem, change the initial free list indexes not to
    wrap across the end of the AGFL, hence avoiding the initialisation
    of agf_fllast to the last index in the AGFL.

    xfs: disallow rw remount on fs with unknown ro-compat features
    
    commit d0a58e833931234c44e515b5b8bede32bd4e6eed upstream.
    
    Today, a kernel which refuses to mount a filesystem read-write
    due to unknown ro-compat features can still transition to read-write
    via the remount path.  The old kernel is most likely none the wiser,
    because it's unaware of the new feature, and isn't using it.  However,
    writing to the filesystem may well corrupt metadata related to that
    new feature, and moving to a newer kernel which understand the feature
    will have problems.
    
    Right now the only ro-compat feature we have is the free inode btree,
    which showed up in v3.16.  It would be good to push this back to
    all the active stable kernels, I think, so that if anyone is using
    newer mkfs (which enables the finobt feature) with older kernel
    releases, they'll be protected.

    gcov: disable tree-loop-im to reduce stack usage
    
    commit c87bf431448b404a6ef5fbabd74c0e3e42157a7f upstream.
    
    Enabling CONFIG_GCOV_PROFILE_ALL produces us a lot of warnings like
    
    lib/lz4/lz4hc_compress.c: In function 'lz4_compresshcctx':
    lib/lz4/lz4hc_compress.c:514:1: warning: the frame size of 1504 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
    
    After some investigation, I found that this behavior started with gcc-4.9,
    and opened https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69702.
    A suggested workaround for it is to use the -fno-tree-loop-im
    flag that turns off one of the optimization stages in gcc, so the
    code runs a little slower but does not use excessive amounts
    of stack.
    
    We could make this conditional on the gcc version, but I could not
    find an easy way to do this in Kbuild and the benefit would be
    fairly small, given that most of the gcc version in production are
    affected now.
    
    I'm marking this for 'stable' backports because it addresses a bug
    with code generation in gcc that exists in all kernel versions
    with the affected gcc releases.

    PM / sleep: Handle failures in device_suspend_late() consistently
    
    commit 3a17fb329da68cb00558721aff876a80bba2fdb9 upstream.
    
    Grygorii Strashko reports:
    
     The PM runtime will be left disabled for the device if its
     .suspend_late() callback fails and async suspend is not allowed
     for this device. In this case device will not be added in
     dpm_late_early_list and dpm_resume_early() will ignore this
     device, as result PM runtime will be disabled for it forever
     (side effect: after 8 subsequent failures for the same device
     the PM runtime will be reenabled due to disable_depth overflow).
    
    To fix this problem, add devices to dpm_late_early_list regardless
    of whether or not device_suspend_late() returns errors for them.
    
    That will ensure failures in there to be handled consistently for
    all devices regardless of their async suspend/resume status.

    ext4: fix oops on corrupted filesystem
    
    commit 74177f55b70e2f2be770dd28684dd6d17106a4ba upstream.
    
    When filesystem is corrupted in the right way, it can happen
    ext4_mark_iloc_dirty() in ext4_orphan_add() returns error and we
    subsequently remove inode from the in-memory orphan list. However this
    deletion is done with list_del(&EXT4_I(inode)->i_orphan) and thus we
    leave i_orphan list_head with a stale content. Later we can look at this
    content causing list corruption, oops, or other issues. The reported
    trace looked like:

    ext4: clean up error handling when orphan list is corrupted
    
    commit 7827a7f6ebfcb7f388dc47fddd48567a314701ba upstream.
    
    Instead of just printing warning messages, if the orphan list is
    corrupted, declare the file system is corrupted.  If there are any
    reserved inodes in the orphaned inode list, declare the file system
    corrupted and stop right away to avoid doing more potential damage to
    the file system.

    ext4: fix hang when processing corrupted orphaned inode list
    
    commit c9eb13a9105e2e418f72e46a2b6da3f49e696902 upstream.
    
    If the orphaned inode list contains inode #5, ext4_iget() returns a
    bad inode (since the bootloader inode should never be referenced
    directly).  Because of the bad inode, we end up processing the inode
    repeatedly and this hangs the machine.
    
    This can be reproduced via:
    
       mke2fs -t ext4 /tmp/foo.img 100
       debugfs -w -R "ssv last_orphan 5" /tmp/foo.img
       mount -o loop /tmp/foo.img /mnt
    
    (But don't do this if you are using an unpatched kernel if you care
    about the system staying functional.  :-)
    
    This bug was found by the port of American Fuzzy Lop into the kernel
    to find file system problems[1].  (Since it *only* happens if inode #5
    shows up on the orphan list --- 3, 7, 8, etc. won't do it, it's not
    surprising that AFL needed two hours before it found it.)

    drm/imx: Match imx-ipuv3-crtc components using device node in platform data
    
    commit 310944d148e3600dcff8b346bee7fa01d34903b1 upstream.
    
    The component master driver imx-drm-core matches component devices using
    their of_node. Since commit 950b410dd1ab ("gpu: ipu-v3: Fix imx-ipuv3-crtc
    module autoloading"), the imx-ipuv3-crtc dev->of_node is not set during
    probing. Before that, of_node was set and caused an of: modalias to be
    used instead of the platform: modalias, which broke module autoloading.
    
    On the other hand, if dev->of_node is not set yet when the imx-ipuv3-crtc
    probe function calls component_add, component matching in imx-drm-core
    fails. While dev->of_node will be set once the next component tries to
    bring up the component master, imx-drm-core component binding will never
    succeed if one of the crtc devices is probed last.
    
    Add of_node to the component platform data and match against the
    pdata->of_node instead of dev->of_node in imx-drm-core to work around
    this problem.

    drm/atomic: Verify connector->funcs != NULL when clearing states
    
    Unfortunately since we don't have Dave's connector refcounting patch
    here yet, it's very possible that drm_atomic_state_default_clear() could
    get called by intel_display_resume() when
    intel_dp_mst_destroy_connector() isn't completely finished destroying an
    mst connector, but has already finished setting connector->funcs to
    NULL. As such, we need to treat the connector like it's already been
    destroyed and just skip it, otherwise we'll end up dereferencing a NULL
    pointer.
    
    This fix is only required for 4.6 and below. David Airlie's patchseries
    for 4.7 to add connector reference counting provides a more proper fix
    for this.
    
    Changes since v1:
     - Fix leftover whitespace

    drm/fb_helper: Fix references to dev->mode_config.num_connector
    
    commit 255f0e7c418ad95a4baeda017ae6182ba9b3c423 upstream.
    
    During boot, MST hotplugs are generally expected (even if no physical
    hotplugging occurs) and result in DRM's connector topology changing.
    This means that using num_connector from the current mode configuration
    can lead to the number of connectors changing under us. This can lead to
    some nasty scenarios in fbcon:
    
    - We allocate an array to the size of dev->mode_config.num_connectors.
    - MST hotplug occurs, dev->mode_config.num_connectors gets incremented.
    - We try to loop through each element in the array using the new value
      of dev->mode_config.num_connectors, and end up going out of bounds
      since dev->mode_config.num_connectors is now larger then the array we
      allocated.
    
    fb_helper->connector_count however, will always remain consistent while
    we do a modeset in fb_helper.
    
    Note: This is just polish for 4.7, Dave Airlie's drm_connector
    refcounting fixed these bugs for real. But it's good enough duct-tape
    for stable kernel backporting, since backporting the refcounting
    changes is way too invasive.

    drm/i915/fbdev: Fix num_connector references in intel_fb_initial_config()
    
    commit 14a3842a1d5945067d1dd0788f314e14d5b18e5b upstream.
    
    During boot time, MST devices usually send a ton of hotplug events
    irregardless of whether or not any physical hotplugs actually occurred.
    Hotplugs mean connectors being created/destroyed, and the number of DRM
    connectors changing under us. This isn't a problem if we use
    fb_helper->connector_count since we only set it once in the code,
    however if we use num_connector from struct drm_mode_config we risk it's
    value changing under us. On top of that, there's even a chance that
    dev->mode_config.num_connector != fb_helper->connector_count. If the
    number of connectors happens to increase under us, we'll end up using
    the wrong array size for memcpy and start writing beyond the actual
    length of the array, occasionally resulting in kernel panics.
    
    Note: This is just polish for 4.7, Dave Airlie's drm_connector
    refcounting fixed these bugs for real. But it's good enough duct-tape
    for stable kernel backporting, since backporting the refcounting
    changes is way too invasive.

    drm/amdgpu: Fix hdmi deep color support.
    
    commit 9d746ab68163d642dae13756b2b3145b2e38cb65 upstream.
    
    When porting the hdmi deep color detection code from
    radeon-kms to amdgpu-kms apparently some kind of
    copy and paste error happened, attaching an else
    branch to the wrong if statement.
    
    The result is that hdmi deep color mode is always
    disabled, regardless of gpu and display capabilities and
    user wishes, as the code mistakenly thinks that the display
    doesn't provide the required max_tmds_clock limit and falls
    back to 8 bpc.
    
    This patch fixes deep color support, as tested on a
    R9 380 Tonga Pro + suitable display, and should be
    backported to all kernels with amdgpu-kms support.

    sunrpc: fix stripping of padded MIC tokens
    
    commit c0cb8bf3a8e4bd82e640862cdd8891400405cb89 upstream.
    
    The length of the GSS MIC token need not be a multiple of four bytes.
    It is then padded by XDR to a multiple of 4 B, but unwrap_integ_data()
    would previously only trim mic.len + 4 B. The remaining up to three
    bytes would then trigger a check in nfs4svc_decode_compoundargs(),
    leading to a "garbage args" error and mount failure:
    
    nfs4svc_decode_compoundargs: compound not properly padded!
    nfsd: failed to decode arguments!
    
    This would prevent older clients using the pre-RFC 4121 MIC format
    (37-byte MIC including a 9-byte OID) from mounting exports from v3.9+
    servers using krb5i.
    
    The trimming was introduced by commit 4c190e2f913f ("sunrpc: trim off
    trailing checksum before returning decrypted or integrity authenticated
    buffer").

    xen/events: Don't move disabled irqs
    
    commit f0f393877c71ad227d36705d61d1e4062bc29cf5 upstream.
    
    Commit ff1e22e7a638 ("xen/events: Mask a moving irq") open-coded
    irq_move_irq() but left out checking if the IRQ is disabled. This broke
    resuming from suspend since it tries to move a (disabled) irq without
    holding the IRQ's desc->lock. Fix it by adding in a check for disabled
    IRQs.
    
    The resulting stacktrace was:

    powerpc/eeh: Restore initial state in eeh_pe_reset_and_recover()
    
    commit 5a0cdbfd17b90a89c64a71d8aec9773ecdb20d0d upstream.
    
    The function eeh_pe_reset_and_recover() is used to recover EEH
    error when the passthrou device are transferred to guest and
    backwards. The content in the device's config space will be lost
    on PE reset issued in the middle of the recovery. The function
    saves/restores it before/after the reset. However, config access
    to some adapters like Broadcom BCM5719 at this point will causes
    fenced PHB. The config space is always blocked and we save 0xFF's
    that are restored at late point. The memory BARs are totally
    corrupted, causing another EEH error upon access to one of the
    memory BARs.
    
    This restores the config space on those adapters like BCM5719
    from the content saved to the EEH device when it's populated,
    to resolve above issue.

    Revert "powerpc/eeh: Fix crash in eeh_add_device_early() on Cell"
    
    commit c2078d9ef600bdbe568c89e5ddc2c6f15b7982c8 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 89a51df5ab1d38b257300b8ac940bbac3bb0eb9b.
    
    The function eeh_add_device_early() is used to perform EEH
    initialization in devices added later on the system, like in
    hotplug/DLPAR scenarios. Since the commit 89a51df5ab1d ("powerpc/eeh:
    Fix crash in eeh_add_device_early() on Cell") a new check was introduced
    in this function - Cell has no EEH capabilities which led to kernel oops
    if hotplug was performed, so checking for eeh_enabled() was introduced
    to avoid the issue.
    
    However, in architectures that EEH is present like pSeries or PowerNV,
    we might reach a case in which no PCI devices are present on boot time
    and so EEH is not initialized. Then, if a device is added via DLPAR for
    example, eeh_add_device_early() fails because eeh_enabled() is false,
    and EEH end up not being enabled at all.
    
    This reverts the aforementioned patch since a new verification was
    introduced by the commit d91dafc02f42 ("powerpc/eeh: Delay probing EEH
    device during hotplug") and so the original Cell issue does not happen
    anymore.

    powerpc/eeh: Don't report error in eeh_pe_reset_and_recover()
    
    commit affeb0f2d3a9af419ad7ef4ac782e1540b2f7b28 upstream.
    
    The function eeh_pe_reset_and_recover() is used to recover EEH
    error when the passthrough device are transferred to guest and
    backwards, meaning the device's driver is vfio-pci or none.
    When the driver is vfio-pci that provides error_detected() error
    handler only, the handler simply stops the guest and it's not
    expected behaviour. On the other hand, no error handlers will
    be called if we don't have a bound driver.
    
    This ignores the error handler in eeh_pe_reset_and_recover()
    that reports the error to device driver to avoid the exceptional
    behaviour.

    powerpc/book3s64: Fix branching to OOL handlers in relocatable kernel
    
    commit 8ed8ab40047a570fdd8043a40c104a57248dd3fd upstream.
    
    Some of the interrupt vectors on 64-bit POWER server processors are only
    32 bytes long (8 instructions), which is not enough for the full
    first-level interrupt handler. For these we need to branch to an
    out-of-line (OOL) handler. But when we are running a relocatable kernel,
    interrupt vectors till __end_interrupts marker are copied down to real
    address 0x100. So, branching to labels (ie. OOL handlers) outside this
    section must be handled differently (see LOAD_HANDLER()), considering
    relocatable kernel, which would need at least 4 instructions.
    
    However, branching from interrupt vector means that we corrupt the
    CFAR (come-from address register) on POWER7 and later processors as
    mentioned in commit 1707dd16. So, EXCEPTION_PROLOG_0 (6 instructions)
    that contains the part up to the point where the CFAR is saved in the
    PACA should be part of the short interrupt vectors before we branch out
    to OOL handlers.
    
    But as mentioned already, there are interrupt vectors on 64-bit POWER
    server processors that are only 32 bytes long (like vectors 0x4f00,
    0x4f20, etc.), which cannot accomodate the above two cases at the same
    time owing to space constraint. Currently, in these interrupt vectors,
    we simply branch out to OOL handlers, without using LOAD_HANDLER(),
    which leaves us vulnerable when running a relocatable kernel (eg. kdump
    case). While this has been the case for sometime now and kdump is used
    widely, we were fortunate not to see any problems so far, for three
    reasons:
    
      1. In almost all cases, production kernel (relocatable) is used for
         kdump as well, which would mean that crashed kernel's OOL handler
         would be at the same place where we end up branching to, from short
         interrupt vector of kdump kernel.
      2. Also, OOL handler was unlikely the reason for crash in almost all
         the kdump scenarios, which meant we had a sane OOL handler from
         crashed kernel that we branched to.
      3. On most 64-bit POWER server processors, page size is large enough
         that marking interrupt vector code as executable (see commit
         429d2e83) leads to marking OOL handler code from crashed kernel,
         that sits right below interrupt vector code from kdump kernel, as
         executable as well.
    
    Let us fix this by moving the __end_interrupts marker down past OOL
    handlers to make sure that we also copy OOL handlers to real address
    0x100 when running a relocatable kernel.
    
    This fix has been tested successfully in kdump scenario, on an LPAR with
    4K page size by using different default/production kernel and kdump
    kernel.
    
    Also tested by manually corrupting the OOL handlers in the first kernel
    and then kdump'ing, and then causing the OOL handlers to fire - mpe.

    pipe: limit the per-user amount of pages allocated in pipes
    
    commit 759c01142a5d0f364a462346168a56de28a80f52 upstream.
    
    On no-so-small systems, it is possible for a single process to cause an
    OOM condition by filling large pipes with data that are never read. A
    typical process filling 4000 pipes with 1 MB of data will use 4 GB of
    memory. On small systems it may be tricky to set the pipe max size to
    prevent this from happening.
    
    This patch makes it possible to enforce a per-user soft limit above
    which new pipes will be limited to a single page, effectively limiting
    them to 4 kB each, as well as a hard limit above which no new pipes may
    be created for this user. This has the effect of protecting the system
    against memory abuse without hurting other users, and still allowing
    pipes to work correctly though with less data at once.
    
    The limit are controlled by two new sysctls : pipe-user-pages-soft, and
    pipe-user-pages-hard. Both may be disabled by setting them to zero. The
    default soft limit allows the default number of FDs per process (1024)
    to create pipes of the default size (64kB), thus reaching a limit of 64MB
    before starting to create only smaller pipes. With 256 processes limited
    to 1024 FDs each, this results in 1024*64kB + (256*1024 - 1024) * 4kB =
    1084 MB of memory allocated for a user. The hard limit is disabled by
    default to avoid breaking existing applications that make intensive use
    of pipes (eg: for splicing).

    wait/ptrace: assume __WALL if the child is traced
    
    commit bf959931ddb88c4e4366e96dd22e68fa0db9527c upstream.
    
    The following program (simplified version of generated by syzkaller)
    
            #include <pthread.h>
            #include <unistd.h>
            #include <sys/ptrace.h>
            #include <stdio.h>
            #include <signal.h>
    
            void *thread_func(void *arg)
            {
                    ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0,0,0);
                    return 0;
            }
    
            int main(void)
            {
                    pthread_t thread;
    
                    if (fork())
                            return 0;
    
                    while (getppid() != 1)
                            ;
    
                    pthread_create(&thread, NULL, thread_func, NULL);
                    pthread_join(thread, NULL);
                    return 0;
            }
    
    creates an unreapable zombie if /sbin/init doesn't use __WALL.
    
    This is not a kernel bug, at least in a sense that everything works as
    expected: debugger should reap a traced sub-thread before it can reap the
    leader, but without __WALL/__WCLONE do_wait() ignores sub-threads.
    
    Unfortunately, it seems that /sbin/init in most (all?) distributions
    doesn't use it and we have to change the kernel to avoid the problem.
    Note also that most init's use sys_waitid() which doesn't allow __WALL, so
    the necessary user-space fix is not that trivial.
    
    This patch just adds the "ptrace" check into eligible_child().  To some
    degree this matches the "tsk->ptrace" in exit_notify(), ->exit_signal is
    mostly ignored when the tracee reports to debugger.  Or WSTOPPED, the
    tracer doesn't need to set this flag to wait for the stopped tracee.
    
    This obviously means the user-visible change: __WCLONE and __WALL no
    longer have any meaning for debugger.  And I can only hope that this won't
    break something, but at least strace/gdb won't suffer.
    
    We could make a more conservative change.  Say, we can take __WCLONE into
    account, or !thread_group_leader().  But it would be nice to not
    complicate these historical/confusing checks.

    mm: use phys_addr_t for reserve_bootmem_region() arguments
    
    commit 4b50bcc7eda4d3cc9e3f2a0aa60e590fedf728c5 upstream.
    
    Since commit 92923ca3aace ("mm: meminit: only set page reserved in the
    memblock region") the reserved bit is set on reserved memblock regions.
    However start and end address are passed as unsigned long.  This is only
    32bit on i386, so it can end up marking the wrong pages reserved for
    ranges at 4GB and above.
    
    This was observed on a 32bit Xen dom0 which was booted with initial
    memory set to a value below 4G but allowing to balloon in memory
    (dom0_mem=1024M for example).  This would define a reserved bootmem
    region for the additional memory (for example on a 8GB system there was
    a reverved region covering the 4GB-8GB range).  But since the addresses
    were passed on as unsigned long, this was actually marking all pages
    from 0 to 4GB as reserved.

    PCI: Disable all BAR sizing for devices with non-compliant BARs
    
    commit ad67b437f187ea818b2860524d10f878fadfdd99 upstream.
    
    b84106b4e229 ("PCI: Disable IO/MEM decoding for devices with non-compliant
    BARs") disabled BAR sizing for BARs 0-5 of devices that don't comply with
    the PCI spec.  But it didn't do anything for expansion ROM BARs, so we
    still try to size them, resulting in warnings like this on Broadwell-EP:
    
      pci 0000:ff:12.0: BAR 6: failed to assign [mem size 0x00000001 pref]
    
    Move the non-compliant BAR check from __pci_read_base() up to
    pci_read_bases() so it applies to the expansion ROM BAR as well as
    to BARs 0-5.
    
    Note that direct callers of __pci_read_base(), like sriov_init(), will now
    bypass this check.  We haven't had reports of devices with broken SR-IOV
    BARs yet.

    The range is registered into a linked list which can be referenced
    throughout the lifetime of the driver. Ensure the range's memory is useful
    for the same lifetime by adding it to the driver's private data structure.
    
    The bug was introduced in the driver's initial commit, which was present in
    v3.10.

    cpuidle: Fix cpuidle_state_is_coupled() argument in cpuidle_enter()
    
    commit e7387da52028b072489c45efeb7a916c0205ebd2 upstream.
    
    Commit 0b89e9aa2856 (cpuidle: delay enabling interrupts until all
    coupled CPUs leave idle) rightfully fixed a regression by letting
    the coupled idle state framework to handle local interrupt enabling
    when the CPU is exiting an idle state.
    
    The current code checks if the idle state is coupled and, if so, it
    will let the coupled code to enable interrupts. This way, it can
    decrement the ready-count before handling the interrupt. This
    mechanism prevents the other CPUs from waiting for a CPU which is
    handling interrupts.
    
    But the check is done against the state index returned by the back
    end driver's ->enter functions which could be different from the
    initial index passed as parameter to the cpuidle_enter_state()
    function.
    
     entered_state = target_state->enter(dev, drv, index);
    
     [ ... ]
    
     if (!cpuidle_state_is_coupled(drv, entered_state))
            local_irq_enable();
    
     [ ... ]
    
    If the 'index' is referring to a coupled idle state but the
    'entered_state' is *not* coupled, then the interrupts are enabled
    again. All CPUs blocked on the sync barrier may busy loop longer
    if the CPU has interrupts to handle before decrementing the
    ready-count. That's consuming more energy than saving.

    cpuidle: Indicate when a device has been unregistered
    
    commit c998c07836f985b24361629dc98506ec7893e7a0 upstream.
    
    Currently the 'registered' member of the cpuidle_device struct is set
    to 1 during cpuidle_register_device. In this same function there are
    checks to see if the device is already registered to prevent duplicate
    calls to register the device, but this value is never set to 0 even on
    unregister of the device. Because of this, any attempt to call
    cpuidle_register_device after a call to cpuidle_unregister_device will
    fail which shouldn't be the case.
    
    To prevent this, set registered to 0 when the device is unregistered.

    commit 7a18afe8097731b8ffb6cb5b2b3b418ded77c105 upstream.
    
    On ads7828 the internal reference defaults to off upon power up. When
    using internal reference, it needs to be turned on and the voltage needs
    to settle before normal conversion cycle can be started. Hence perform a
    dummy read in the probe to enable the internal reference allowing the
    voltage to settle before performing a normal read.
    
    Without this fix, the first read from the ADC when using internal
    reference always returns incorrect data.

    aacraid: Fix for KDUMP driver hang
    
    commit 78cbccd3bd683c295a44af8050797dc4a41376ff upstream.
    
    When KDUMP is triggered the driver first talks to the firmware in INTX
    mode, but the adapter firmware is still in MSIX mode. Therefore the first
    driver command hangs since the driver is waiting for an INTX response and
    firmware gives a MSIX response. If when the OS is installed on a RAID
    drive created by the adapter KDUMP will hang since the driver does not
    receive a response in sync mode.
    
    Fixed by: Change the firmware to INTX mode if it is in MSIX mode before
    sending the first sync command.

    aacraid: Fix for aac_command_thread hang
    
    commit fc4bf75ea300a5e62a2419f89dd0e22189dd7ab7 upstream.
    
    Typically under error conditions, it is possible for aac_command_thread()
    to miss the wakeup from kthread_stop() and go back to sleep, causing it
    to hang aac_shutdown.
    
    In the observed scenario, the adapter is not functioning correctly and so
    aac_fib_send() never completes (or time-outs depending on how it was
    called). Shortly after aac_command_thread() starts it performs
    aac_fib_send(SendHostTime) which hangs. When aac_probe_one
    /aac_get_adapter_info send time outs, kthread_stop is called which breaks
    the command thread out of it's hang.
    
    The code will still go back to sleep in schedule_timeout() without
    checking kthread_should_stop() so it causes aac_probe_one to hang until
    the schedule_timeout() which is 30 minutes.
    
    Fixed by: Adding another kthread_should_stop() before schedule_timeout()

    aacraid: Relinquish CPU during timeout wait
    
    commit 07beca2be24cc710461c0b131832524c9ee08910 upstream.
    
    aac_fib_send has a special function case for initial commands during
    driver initialization using wait < 0(pseudo sync mode). In this case,
    the command does not sleep but rather spins checking for timeout.This
    loop is calls cpu_relax() in an attempt to allow other processes/threads
    to use the CPU, but this function does not relinquish the CPU and so the
    command will hog the processor. This was observed in a KDUMP
    "crashkernel" and that prevented the "command thread" (which is
    responsible for completing the command from being timed out) from
    starting because it could not get the CPU.
    
    Fixed by replacing "cpu_relax()" call with "schedule()"

    The previous patch added an option to rtl8723be to manually select the
    antenna for those cases when only a single antenna is present, and the
    on-board EEPROM is incorrectly programmed. This patch implements the

    rtlwifi: rtl8723be: Add antenna select module parameter
    
    commit c18d8f5095715c56bb3cd9cba64242542632054b upstream.
    
    A number of new laptops have been delivered with only a single antenna.
    In principle, this is OK; however, a problem arises when the on-board
    EEPROM is programmed to use the other antenna connection. The option
    of opening the computer and moving the connector is not always possible
    as it will void the warranty in some cases. In addition, this solution
    breaks the Windows driver when the box dual boots Linux and Windows.
    
    A fix involving a new module parameter has been developed.  This commit
    adds the new parameter and implements the changes needed for the driver.

    ath10k: fix kernel panic, move arvifs list head init before htt init
    
    commit 4ad24a9d83bd4bf0a85e95bf144e18d3fda4fbf1 upstream.
    
    It is observed that while loading and unloading ath10k modules
    in an infinite loop, before ath10k_core_start() completion HTT
    rx frames are received, while processing these frames,
    dereferencing the arvifs list code is getting hit before
    initilizing the arvifs list, causing a kernel panic.
    
    This patch initilizes the arvifs list before initilizing htt.

    ath10k: fix rx_channel during hw reconfigure
    
    commit 1ce8c1484e80010a6e4b9611c65668ff77556f45 upstream.
    
    Upon firmware assert, restart work will be triggered so that mac80211
    will reconfigure the driver. An issue is reported that after restart
    work, survey dump data do not contain in-use (SURVEY_INFO_IN_USE) info
    for operating channel. During reconfigure, since mac80211 already has
    valid channel context for given radio, channel context iteration return
    num_chanctx > 0. Hence rx_channel is always NULL. Fix this by assigning
    channel context to rx_channel when driver restart is in progress.

    ath10k: fix firmware assert in monitor mode
    
    commit 8a75fc54745fd3ce9062ab1cc6429a9da9ac2a68 upstream.
    
    commit 166de3f1895d ("ath10k: remove supported chain mask") had revealed
    an issue on monitor mode. Configuring NSS upon monitor interface
    creation is causing target assert in all qca9888x and qca6174 firmware.
    Firmware assert issue can be reproduced by below sequence even after
    reverting commit 166de3f1895d ("ath10k: remove supported chain mask").
    
    ip link set wlan0 down
    iw wlan0 set type monitor
    iw phy0 set antenna 7
    ip link set wlan0 up
    
    This issue is originally reported on qca9888 with 10.1 firmware.

    The Wistron DNMA-92 and Compex WLM200NX have inverted LED polarity
    (active high instead of active low).
    
    The same PCI Subsystem ID is used by both cards, which are based on

    The LED can be active high instead of active low on some hardware.
    
    Add the led_active_high module parameter. It defaults to -1 to obey
    platform data as before.
    
    Setting the parameter to 1 or 0 will force the LED respectively
    active high or active low.

    commit d3030d11961a8c103cf07aed59905276ddfc06c2 upstream.
    
    The ak4642 driver is using a regmap cache sync to restore the
    configuration of the chip on resume but (as Peter observed) does not
    actually define a register cache which means that the resume is never
    going to work and we trigger asserts in regmap.  Fix this by enabling
    caching.

    affs: fix remount failure when there are no options changed
    
    commit 01d6e08711bf90bc4d7ead14a93a0cbd73b1896a upstream.
    
    Commit c8f33d0bec99 ("affs: kstrdup() memory handling") checks if the
    kstrdup function returns NULL due to out-of-memory condition.
    
    However, if we are remounting a filesystem with no change to
    filesystem-specific options, the parameter data is NULL.  In this case,
    kstrdup returns NULL (because it was passed NULL parameter), although no
    out of memory condition exists.  The mount syscall then fails with
    ENOMEM.
    
    This patch fixes the bug.  We fail with ENOMEM only if data is non-NULL.
    
    The patch also changes the call to replace_mount_options - if we didn't
    pass any filesystem-specific options, we don't call
    replace_mount_options (thus we don't erase existing reported options).

    MIPS: lib: Mark intrinsics notrace
    
    commit aedcfbe06558a9f53002e82d5be64c6c94687726 upstream.
    
    On certain MIPS32 devices, the ftrace tracer "function_graph" uses
    __lshrdi3() during the capturing of trace data. ftrace then attempts to
    trace __lshrdi3() which leads to infinite recursion and a stack overflow.
    Fix this by marking __lshrdi3() as notrace. Mark the other compiler
    intrinsics as notrace in case the compiler decides to use them in the
    ftrace path.

    MIPS: Fix sigreturn via VDSO on microMIPS kernel
    
    commit 13eb192d10bcc9ac518d57356179071d603bcb4e upstream.
    
    In microMIPS kernels, handle_signal() sets the isa16 mode bit in the
    vdso address so that the sigreturn trampolines (which are offset from
    the VDSO) get executed as microMIPS.
    
    However commit ebb5e78cc634 ("MIPS: Initial implementation of a VDSO")
    changed the offsets to come from the VDSO image, which already have the
    isa16 mode bit set correctly since they're extracted from the VDSO
    shared library symbol table.
    
    Drop the isa16 mode bit handling from handle_signal() to fix sigreturn
    for cores which support both microMIPS and normal MIPS. This doesn't fix
    microMIPS only cores, since the VDSO is still built for normal MIPS, but
    thats a separate problem.

    MIPS: ptrace: Prevent writes to read-only FCSR bits
    
    commit abf378be49f38c4d3e23581d3df3fa9f1b1b11d2 upstream.
    
    Correct the cases missed with commit 9b26616c8d9d ("MIPS: Respect the
    ISA level in FCSR handling") and prevent writes to read-only FCSR bits
    there.
    
    This in particular applies to FP context initialisation where any IEEE
    754-2008 bits preset by `mips_set_personality_nan' are cleared before
    the relevant ptrace(2) call takes effect and the PTRACE_POKEUSR request
    addressing FPC_CSR where no masking of read-only FCSR bits is done.
    
    Remove the FCSR clearing from FP context initialisation then and unify
    PTRACE_POKEUSR/FPC_CSR and PTRACE_SETFPREGS handling, by factoring out
    code from `ptrace_setfpregs' and calling it from both places.
    
    This mostly matters to soft float configurations where the emulator can
    be switched this way to a mode which should not be accessible and cannot
    be set with the CTC1 instruction.  With hard float configurations any
    effect is transient anyway as read-only bits will retain their values at
    the time the FP context is restored.

    MIPS: ptrace: Fix FP context restoration FCSR regression
    
    commit 4249548454f7ba4581aeee26bd83f42b48a14d15 upstream.
    
    Fix a floating-point context restoration regression introduced with
    commit 9b26616c8d9d ("MIPS: Respect the ISA level in FCSR handling")
    that causes a Floating Point exception and consequently a kernel oops
    with hard float configurations when one or more FCSR Enable and their
    corresponding Cause bits are set both at a time via a ptrace(2) call.
    
    To do so reinstate Cause bit masking originally introduced with commit
    b1442d39fac2 ("MIPS: Prevent user from setting FCSR cause bits") to
    address this exact problem and then inadvertently removed from the
    PTRACE_SETFPREGS request with the commit referred above.

    MIPS: Prevent "restoration" of MSA context in non-MSA kernels
    
    commit 6533af4d4831c421cd9aa4dce7cfc19a3514cc09 upstream.
    
    If a kernel doesn't support MSA context (ie. CONFIG_CPU_HAS_MSA=n) then
    it will only keep 64 bits per FP register in thread context, and the
    calls to set_fpr64 in restore_msa_extcontext will overrun the end of the
    FP register context into the FCSR & MSACSR values. GCC 6.x has become
    smart enough to detect this & complain like so:
    
        arch/mips/kernel/signal.c: In function 'protected_restore_fp_context':
        ./arch/mips/include/asm/processor.h:114:17: error: array subscript is above array bounds [-Werror=array-bounds]
          fpr->val##width[FPR_IDX(width, idx)] = val;   \
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        ./arch/mips/include/asm/processor.h:118:1: note: in expansion of macro 'BUILD_FPR_ACCESS'
         BUILD_FPR_ACCESS(64)
    
    The only way to trigger this code to run would be for a program to set
    up an artificial extended MSA context structure following a sigframe &
    execute sigreturn. Whilst this doesn't allow a program to write to any
    state that it couldn't already, it makes little sense to allow this
    "restoration" of MSA context in a system that doesn't support MSA.
    
    Fix this by killing a program with SIGSYS if it tries something as crazy
    as "restoring" fake MSA context in this way, also fixing the build error
    & allowing for most of restore_msa_extcontext to be optimised out of
    kernels without support for MSA.

    MIPS: ath79: make bootconsole wait for both THRE and TEMT
    
    commit f5b556c94c8490d42fea79d7b4ae0ecbc291e69d upstream.
    
    This makes the ath79 bootconsole behave the same way as the generic 8250
    bootconsole.
    
    Also waiting for TEMT (transmit buffer is empty) instead of just THRE
    (transmit buffer is not full) ensures that all characters have been
    transmitted before the real serial driver starts reconfiguring the serial
    controller (which would sometimes result in garbage being transmitted.)
    This change does not cause a visible performance loss.
    
    In addition, this seems to fix a hang observed in certain configurations on
    many AR7xxx/AR9xxx SoCs during autoconfig of the real serial driver.
    
    A more complete follow-up patch will disable 8250 autoconfig for ath79
    altogether (the serial controller is detected as a 16550A, which is not
    fully compatible with the ath79 serial, and the autoconfig may lead to
    undefined behavior on ath79.)

    If CPU1 maps the page in between CPU0's set_pte_at, which marks it valid
    & visible, and update_mmu_cache where the dcache flush occurs then CPU1s
    icache will fill from stale data (unless it fills from the dcache, in
    which case all is good, but most MIPS CPUs don't have this property).
    Commit 4d46a67a3eb8 ("MIPS: Fix race condition in lazy cache flushing.")
    attempted to fix that by performing the dcache flush in
    flush_icache_page such that it occurs before the set_pte_at call makes
    the page visible. However it has the problem that not all code that
    writes to pages exposed to userland call flush_icache_page. There are
    many callers of set_pte_at under mm/ and only 2 of them do call
    flush_icache_page. Thus the race window between a page becoming visible
    & being coherent between the icache & dcache remains open in some cases.
    
    To illustrate some of the cases, a WARN was added to __update_cache with
    this patch applied that triggered in cases where a page about to be
    flushed from the dcache was not the last page provided to
    flush_icache_page. That is, backtraces were obtained for cases in which
    the race window is left open without this patch. The 2 standout examples
    follow.
    
    When forking a process:
    
    [   15.271842] [<80417630>] __update_cache+0xcc/0x188
    [   15.277274] [<80530394>] copy_page_range+0x56c/0x6ac

    [   15.293747] [<80413808>] handle_sys+0x128/0x14c
    
    When exec'ing an ELF binary:
    
    [   14.445964] [<80417630>] __update_cache+0xcc/0x188
    [   14.451369] [<80538d88>] move_page_tables+0x414/0x498
    [   14.457075] [<8055d848>] setup_arg_pages+0x220/0x318
    [   14.462685] [<805b0f38>] load_elf_binary+0x530/0x12a0

    [   14.480324] [<8055f938>] do_execve+0x38/0x44
    [   14.485137] [<80413808>] handle_sys+0x128/0x14c
    
    These code paths write into a page, call flush_dcache_page then call
    set_pte_at without flush_icache_page inbetween. The end result is that
    the icache can become corrupted & userland processes may execute
    unexpected or invalid code, typically resulting in a reserved
    instruction exception, a trap or a segfault.
    
    Fix this race condition fully by performing any cache maintenance
    required to keep the icache & dcache in sync in set_pte_at, before the
    page is made valid. This has the added bonus of ensuring the cache
    maintenance always happens in one location, rather than being duplicated
    in flush_icache_page & update_mmu_cache. It also matches the way other
    architectures solve the same problem (see arm, ia64 & powerpc).

    MIPS: Handle highmem pages in __update_cache
    
    commit f4281bba818105c7c91799abe40bc05c0dbdaa25 upstream.
    
    The following patch will expose __update_cache to highmem pages. Handle
    them by mapping them in for the duration of the cache maintenance, just
    like in __flush_dcache_page. The code for that isn't shared because we
    need the page address in __update_cache so sharing became messy. Given
    that the entirity is an extra 5 lines, just duplicate it.

    MIPS: Flush highmem pages in __flush_dcache_page
    
    commit 234859e49a15323cf1b2331bdde7f658c4cb45fb upstream.
    
    When flush_dcache_page is called on an executable page, that page is
    about to be provided to userland & we can presume that the icache
    contains no valid entries for its address range. However if the icache
    does not fill from the dcache then we cannot presume that the pages
    content has been written back as far as the memories that the dcache
    will fill from (ie. L2 or further out).
    
    This was being done for lowmem pages, but not for highmem which can lead
    to icache corruption. Fix this by mapping highmem pages & flushing their
    content from the dcache in __flush_dcache_page before providing the page
    to userland, just as is done for lowmem pages.

    MIPS: Fix watchpoint restoration
    
    commit a7e89326b415b5d81c4b1016fd4a40db861eb58d upstream.
    
    Commit f51246efee2b ("MIPS: Get rid of finish_arch_switch().") moved the
    __restore_watch() call from finish_arch_switch() (i.e. after resume()
    returns) to before the resume() call in switch_to(). This results in
    watchpoints only being restored when a task is descheduled, preventing
    the watchpoints from being effective most of the time, except due to
    chance before the watchpoints are lazily removed.
    
    Fix the call sequence from switch_to() through to
    mips_install_watch_registers() to pass the task_struct pointer of the
    next task, instead of using current. This allows the watchpoints for the
    next (non-current) task to be restored without reintroducing
    finish_arch_switch().

    MIPS: Fix uapi include in exported asm/siginfo.h
    
    commit 987e5b834467c9251ca584febda65ef8f66351a9 upstream.
    
    Since commit 8cb48fe169dd ("MIPS: Provide correct siginfo_t.si_stime"),
    MIPS' uapi/asm/siginfo.h has included uapi/asm-generic/siginfo.h
    directly before defining MIPS' struct siginfo, in order to get the
    necessary definitions needed for the siginfo struct without the generic
    copy_siginfo() hitting compiler errors due to struct siginfo not yet
    being defined.
    
    Now that the generic copy_siginfo() is moved out to linux/signal.h we
    can safely include asm-generic/siginfo.h before defining the MIPS
    specific struct siginfo, which avoids the uapi/ include as well as
    breakage due to generic copy_siginfo() being defined before struct
    siginfo.

    Commit 85efde6f4e0d ("make exported headers use strict posix types")
    changed the asm-generic siginfo.h to use the __kernel_* types, and
    commit 3a471cbc081b ("remove __KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES") make the internal
    types accessible only to the kernel, but the MIPS implementation hasn't
    been updated to match.

    produce quite so many compiler errors when included alone by a user
    program.

    MIPS: Avoid using unwind_stack() with usermode
    
    commit 81a76d7119f63c359750e4adeff922a31ad1135f upstream.
    
    When showing backtraces in response to traps, for example crashes and
    address errors (usually unaligned accesses) when they are set in debugfs
    to be reported, unwind_stack will be used if the PC was in the kernel
    text address range. However since EVA it is possible for user and kernel
    address ranges to overlap, and even without EVA userland can still
    trigger an address error by jumping to a KSeg0 address.
    
    Adjust the check to also ensure that it was running in kernel mode. I
    don't believe any harm can come of this problem, since unwind_stack() is
    sufficiently defensive, however it is only meant for unwinding kernel
    code, so to be correct it should use the raw backtracing instead.

    MIPS: Don't unwind to user mode with EVA
    
    commit a816b306c62195b7c43c92cb13330821a96bdc27 upstream.
    
    When unwinding through IRQs and exceptions, the unwinding only continues
    if the PC is a kernel text address, however since EVA it is possible for
    user and kernel address ranges to overlap, potentially allowing
    unwinding to continue to user mode if the user PC happens to be in the
    kernel text address range.
    
    Adjust the check to also ensure that the register state from before the
    exception is actually running in kernel mode, i.e. !user_mode(regs).
    
    I don't believe any harm can come of this problem, since the PC is only
    output, the stack pointer is checked to ensure it resides within the
    task's stack page before it is dereferenced in search of the return
    address, and the return address register is similarly only output (if
    the PC is in a leaf function or the beginning of a non-leaf function).
    
    However unwind_stack() is only meant for unwinding kernel code, so to be
    correct the unwind should stop there.

    MIPS: math-emu: Fix jalr emulation when rd == $0

    When emulating a jalr instruction with rd == $0, the code in
    isBranchInstr was incorrectly writing to GPR $0 which should actually
    always remain zeroed. This would lead to any further instructions
    emulated which use $0 operating on a bogus value until the task is next
    context switched, at which point the value of $0 in the task context
    would be restored to the correct zero by a store in SAVE_SOME. Fix this
    by not writing to rd if it is $0.
