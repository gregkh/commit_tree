    x86/speculation/swapgs: Exclude ATOMs from speculation through SWAPGS
    
    commit f36cf386e3fec258a341d446915862eded3e13d8 upstream
    
    Intel provided the following information:
    
     On all current Atom processors, instructions that use a segment register
     value (e.g. a load or store) will not speculatively execute before the
     last writer of that segment retires. Thus they will not use a
     speculatively written segment value.
    
    That means on ATOMs there is no speculation through SWAPGS, so the SWAPGS
    entry paths can be excluded from the extra LFENCE if PTI is disabled.
    
    Create a separate bug flag for the through SWAPGS speculation and mark all
    out-of-order ATOMs and AMD/HYGON CPUs as not affected. The in-order ATOMs
    are excluded from the whole mitigation mess anyway.

    x86/speculation: Enable Spectre v1 swapgs mitigations
    
    commit a2059825986a1c8143fd6698774fa9d83733bb11 upstream
    
    The previous commit added macro calls in the entry code which mitigate the
    Spectre v1 swapgs issue if the X86_FEATURE_FENCE_SWAPGS_* features are
    enabled.  Enable those features where applicable.
    
    The mitigations may be disabled with "nospectre_v1" or "mitigations=off".
    
    There are different features which can affect the risk of attack:
    
    - When FSGSBASE is enabled, unprivileged users are able to place any
      value in GS, using the wrgsbase instruction.  This means they can
      write a GS value which points to any value in kernel space, which can
      be useful with the following gadget in an interrupt/exception/NMI
      handler:
    
            if (coming from user space)
                    swapgs
            mov %gs:<percpu_offset>, %reg1
            // dependent load or store based on the value of %reg
            // for example: mov %(reg1), %reg2
    
      If an interrupt is coming from user space, and the entry code
      speculatively skips the swapgs (due to user branch mistraining), it
      may speculatively execute the GS-based load and a subsequent dependent
      load or store, exposing the kernel data to an L1 side channel leak.
    
      Note that, on Intel, a similar attack exists in the above gadget when
      coming from kernel space, if the swapgs gets speculatively executed to
      switch back to the user GS.  On AMD, this variant isn't possible
      because swapgs is serializing with respect to future GS-based
      accesses.
    
      NOTE: The FSGSBASE patch set hasn't been merged yet, so the above case
            doesn't exist quite yet.
    
    - When FSGSBASE is disabled, the issue is mitigated somewhat because
      unprivileged users must use prctl(ARCH_SET_GS) to set GS, which
      restricts GS values to user space addresses only.  That means the
      gadget would need an additional step, since the target kernel address
      needs to be read from user space first.  Something like:
    
            if (coming from user space)
                    swapgs
            mov %gs:<percpu_offset>, %reg1
            mov (%reg1), %reg2
            // dependent load or store based on the value of %reg2
            // for example: mov %(reg2), %reg3
    
      It's difficult to audit for this gadget in all the handlers, so while
      there are no known instances of it, it's entirely possible that it
      exists somewhere (or could be introduced in the future).  Without
      tooling to analyze all such code paths, consider it vulnerable.
    
      Effects of SMAP on the !FSGSBASE case:
    
      - If SMAP is enabled, and the CPU reports RDCL_NO (i.e., not
        susceptible to Meltdown), the kernel is prevented from speculatively
        reading user space memory, even L1 cached values.  This effectively
        disables the !FSGSBASE attack vector.
    
      - If SMAP is enabled, but the CPU *is* susceptible to Meltdown, SMAP
        still prevents the kernel from speculatively reading user space
        memory.  But it does *not* prevent the kernel from reading the
        user value from L1, if it has already been cached.  This is probably
        only a small hurdle for an attacker to overcome.
    
    Thanks to Dave Hansen for contributing the speculative_smap() function.
    
    Thanks to Andrew Cooper for providing the inside scoop on whether swapgs
    is serializing on AMD.

    x86/speculation: Prepare entry code for Spectre v1 swapgs mitigations
    
    commit 18ec54fdd6d18d92025af097cd042a75cf0ea24c upstream
    
    Spectre v1 isn't only about array bounds checks.  It can affect any
    conditional checks.  The kernel entry code interrupt, exception, and NMI
    handlers all have conditional swapgs checks.  Those may be problematic in
    the context of Spectre v1, as kernel code can speculatively run with a user
    GS.
    
    For example:
    
            if (coming from user space)
                    swapgs
            mov %gs:<percpu_offset>, %reg
            mov (%reg), %reg1
    
    When coming from user space, the CPU can speculatively skip the swapgs, and
    then do a speculative percpu load using the user GS value.  So the user can
    speculatively force a read of any kernel value.  If a gadget exists which
    uses the percpu value as an address in another load/store, then the
    contents of the kernel value may become visible via an L1 side channel
    attack.
    
    A similar attack exists when coming from kernel space.  The CPU can
    speculatively do the swapgs, causing the user GS to get used for the rest
    of the speculative window.
    
    The mitigation is similar to a traditional Spectre v1 mitigation, except:
    
      a) index masking isn't possible; because the index (percpu offset)
         isn't user-controlled; and
    
      b) an lfence is needed in both the "from user" swapgs path and the
         "from kernel" non-swapgs path (because of the two attacks described
         above).
    
    The user entry swapgs paths already have SWITCH_TO_KERNEL_CR3, which has a
    CR3 write when PTI is enabled.  Since CR3 writes are serializing, the
    lfences can be skipped in those cases.
    
    On the other hand, the kernel entry swapgs paths don't depend on PTI.
    
    To avoid unnecessary lfences for the user entry case, create two separate
    features for alternative patching:
    
      X86_FEATURE_FENCE_SWAPGS_USER
      X86_FEATURE_FENCE_SWAPGS_KERNEL
    
    Use these features in entry code to patch in lfences where needed.
    
    The features aren't enabled yet, so there's no functional change.

    x86/cpufeatures: Combine word 11 and 12 into a new scattered features word
    
    commit acec0ce081de0c36459eea91647faf99296445a3 upstream
    
    It's a waste for the four X86_FEATURE_CQM_* feature bits to occupy two
    whole feature bits words. To better utilize feature words, re-define
    word 11 to host scattered features and move the four X86_FEATURE_CQM_*
    features into Linux defined word 11. More scattered features can be
    added in word 11 in the future.
    
    Rename leaf 11 in cpuid_leafs to CPUID_LNX_4 to reflect it's a
    Linux-defined leaf.
    
    Rename leaf 12 as CPUID_DUMMY which will be replaced by a meaningful
    name in the next patch when CPUID.7.1:EAX occupies world 12.
    
    Maximum number of RMID and cache occupancy scale are retrieved from
    CPUID.0xf.1 after scattered CQM features are enumerated. Carve out the
    code into a separate function.
    
    KVM doesn't support resctrl now. So it's safe to move the
    X86_FEATURE_CQM_* features to scattered features word 11 for KVM.

    x86/vdso: Prevent segfaults due to hoisted vclock reads
    
    commit ff17bbe0bb405ad8b36e55815d381841f9fdeebc upstream.
    
    GCC 5.5.0 sometimes cleverly hoists reads of the pvclock and/or hvclock
    pages before the vclock mode checks.  This creates a path through
    vclock_gettime() in which no vclock is enabled at all (due to disabled
    TSC on old CPUs, for example) but the pvclock or hvclock page
    nevertheless read.  This will segfault on bare metal.
    
    This fixes commit 459e3a21535a ("gcc-9: properly declare the
    {pv,hv}clock_page storage") in the sense that, before that commit, GCC
    didn't seem to generate the offending code.  There was nothing wrong
    with that commit per se, and -stable maintainers should backport this to
    all supported kernels regardless of whether the offending commit was
    present, since the same crash could just as easily be triggered by the
    phase of the moon.
    
    On GCC 9.1.1, this doesn't seem to affect the generated code at all, so
    I'm not too concerned about performance regressions from this fix.

    The pvlock_page and hvclock_page variables are (as the name implies)
    addresses to pages, created by the linker script.
    
    But we declared them as just "extern u8" variables, which _works_, but
    now that gcc does some more bounds checking, it causes warnings like
    
        warning: array subscript 1 is outside array bounds of ‘u8[1]’
    
    when we then access more than one byte from those variables.
    
    Fix this by simply making the declaration of the variables match
    reality, which makes the compiler happy too.

    objtool: Support GCC 9 cold subfunction naming scheme
    
    commit bcb6fb5da77c2a228adf07cc9cb1a0c2aa2001c6 upstream.
    
    Starting with GCC 8, a lot of unlikely code was moved out of line to
    "cold" subfunctions in .text.unlikely.
    
    For example, the unlikely bits of:
    
      irq_do_set_affinity()
    
    are moved out to the following subfunction:
    
      irq_do_set_affinity.cold.49()
    
    Starting with GCC 9, the numbered suffix has been removed.  So in the
    above example, the cold subfunction is instead:
    
      irq_do_set_affinity.cold()
    
    Tweak the objtool subfunction detection logic so that it detects both
    GCC 8 and GCC 9 naming schemes.

    This ensures that nothing can continue to access the MR once it has been
    placed in the kernels cache for reuse.
    
    MRs in the cache continue to have their HW state, including DMA tables,
    present. Even though the MR has been invalidated, changing the PD provides
    an additional layer of protection against use of the MR.

    IB/mlx5: Use direct mkey destroy command upon UMR unreg failure
    
    commit afd1417404fba6dbfa6c0a8e5763bd348da682e4 upstream.
    
    Use a direct firmware command to destroy the mkey in case the unreg UMR
    operation has failed.
    
    This prevents a case that a mkey will leak out from the cache post a
    failure to be destroyed by a UMR WR.
    
    In case the MR cache limit didn't reach a call to add another entry to the
    cache instead of the destroyed one is issued.
    
    In addition, replaced a warn message to WARN_ON() as this flow is fatal
    and can't happen unless some bug around.

    xen/swiotlb: fix condition for calling xen_destroy_contiguous_region()
    
    commit 50f6393f9654c561df4cdcf8e6cfba7260143601 upstream.
    
    The condition in xen_swiotlb_free_coherent() for deciding whether to
    call xen_destroy_contiguous_region() is wrong: in case the region to
    be freed is not contiguous calling xen_destroy_contiguous_region() is
    the wrong thing to do: it would result in inconsistent mappings of
    multiple PFNs to the same MFN. This will lead to various strange
    crashes or data corruption.
    
    Instead of calling xen_destroy_contiguous_region() in that case a
    warning should be issued as that situation should never occur.

    s390/dasd: fix endless loop after read unit address configuration
    
    commit 41995342b40c418a47603e1321256d2c4a2ed0fb upstream.
    
    After getting a storage server event that causes the DASD device driver
    to update its unit address configuration during a device shutdown there is
    the possibility of an endless loop in the device driver.
    
    In the system log there will be ongoing DASD error messages with RC: -19.
    
    The reason is that the loop starting the ruac request only terminates when
    the retry counter is decreased to 0. But in the sleep_on function there are
    early exit paths that do not decrease the retry counter.
    
    Prevent an endless loop by handling those cases separately.
    
    Remove the unnecessary do..while loop since the sleep_on function takes
    care of retries by itself.

    commit 6497d0a9c53df6e98b25e2b79f2295d7caa47b6e upstream.
    
    sl is controlled by user-space, hence leading to a potential
    exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.
    
    Fix this by sanitizing sl before using it to index ibp->sl_to_sc.
    
    Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
    to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
    completed with a dependent load/store [1].

    gpiolib: fix incorrect IRQ requesting of an active-low lineevent
    
    commit 223ecaf140b1dd1c1d2a1a1d96281efc5c906984 upstream.
    
    When a pin is active-low, logical trigger edge should be inverted to match
    the same interrupt opportunity.
    
    For example, a button pushed triggers falling edge in ACTIVE_HIGH case; in
    ACTIVE_LOW case, the button pushed triggers rising edge. For user space the
    IRQ requesting doesn't need to do any modification except to configuring
    GPIOHANDLE_REQUEST_ACTIVE_LOW.
    
    For example, we want to catch the event when the button is pushed. The
    button on the original board drives level to be low when it is pushed, and
    drives level to be high when it is released.
    
    In user space we can do:
    
            req.handleflags = GPIOHANDLE_REQUEST_INPUT;
            req.eventflags = GPIOEVENT_REQUEST_FALLING_EDGE;
    
            while (1) {
                    read(fd, &dat, sizeof(dat));
                    if (dat.id == GPIOEVENT_EVENT_FALLING_EDGE)
                            printf("button pushed\n");
            }
    
    Run the same logic on another board which the polarity of the button is
    inverted; it drives level to be high when pushed, and level to be low when
    released. For this inversion we add flag GPIOHANDLE_REQUEST_ACTIVE_LOW:
    
            req.handleflags = GPIOHANDLE_REQUEST_INPUT |
                    GPIOHANDLE_REQUEST_ACTIVE_LOW;
            req.eventflags = GPIOEVENT_REQUEST_FALLING_EDGE;
    
    At the result, there are no any events caught when the button is pushed.
    By the way, button releasing will emit a "falling" event. The timing of
    "falling" catching is not expected.

    mmc: dw_mmc: Fix occasional hang after tuning on eMMC
    
    commit ba2d139b02ba684c6c101de42fed782d6cd2b997 upstream.
    
    In commit 46d179525a1f ("mmc: dw_mmc: Wait for data transfer after
    response errors.") we fixed a tuning-induced hang that I saw when
    stress testing tuning on certain SD cards.  I won't re-hash that whole
    commit, but the summary is that as a normal part of tuning you need to
    deal with transfer errors and there were cases where these transfer
    errors was putting my system into a bad state causing all future
    transfers to fail.  That commit fixed handling of the transfer errors
    for me.
    
    In downstream Chrome OS my fix landed and had the same behavior for
    all SD/MMC commands.  However, it looks like when the commit landed
    upstream we limited it to only SD tuning commands.  Presumably this
    was to try to get around problems that Alim Akhtar reported on exynos
    [1].
    
    Unfortunately while stress testing reboots (and suspend/resume) on
    some rk3288-based Chromebooks I found the same problem on the eMMC on
    some of my Chromebooks (the ones with Hynix eMMC).  Since the eMMC
    tuning command is different (MMC_SEND_TUNING_BLOCK_HS200
    vs. MMC_SEND_TUNING_BLOCK) we were basically getting back into the
    same situation.
    
    I'm hoping that whatever problems exynos was having in the past are
    somehow magically fixed now and we can make the behavior the same for
    all commands.

    Btrfs: fix race leading to fs corruption after transaction abort
    
    commit cb2d3daddbfb6318d170e79aac1f7d5e4d49f0d7 upstream.
    
    When one transaction is finishing its commit, it is possible for another
    transaction to start and enter its initial commit phase as well. If the
    first ends up getting aborted, we have a small time window where the second
    transaction commit does not notice that the previous transaction aborted
    and ends up committing, writing a superblock that points to btrees that
    reference extent buffers (nodes and leafs) that were not persisted to disk.
    The consequence is that after mounting the filesystem again, we will be
    unable to load some btree nodes/leafs, either because the content on disk
    is either garbage (or just zeroes) or corresponds to the old content of a
    previouly COWed or deleted node/leaf, resulting in the well known error
    messages "parent transid verify failed on ...".
    The following sequence diagram illustrates how this can happen.
    
            CPU 1                                           CPU 2

    So fix this by updating the transaction commit path to check if the flag
    BTRFS_FS_STATE_TRANS_ABORTED is set on fs_info->fs_state if after setting
    the transaction to the TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START we do not find any previous
    transaction in the fs_info->trans_list. If the flag is set, just fail the
    transaction commit with -EROFS, as we do in other places. The exact error
    code for the previous transaction abort was already logged and reported.

    Btrfs: fix incremental send failure after deduplication
    
    commit b4f9a1a87a48c255bb90d8a6c3d555a1abb88130 upstream.
    
    When doing an incremental send operation we can fail if we previously did
    deduplication operations against a file that exists in both snapshots. In
    that case we will fail the send operation with -EIO and print a message
    to dmesg/syslog like the following:
    
      BTRFS error (device sdc): Send: inconsistent snapshot, found updated \
      extent for inode 257 without updated inode item, send root is 258, \
      parent root is 257
    
    This requires that we deduplicate to the same file in both snapshots for
    the same amount of times on each snapshot. The issue happens because a
    deduplication only updates the iversion of an inode and does not update
    any other field of the inode, therefore if we deduplicate the file on
    each snapshot for the same amount of time, the inode will have the same
    iversion value (stored as the "sequence" field on the inode item) on both
    snapshots, therefore it will be seen as unchanged between in the send
    snapshot while there are new/updated/deleted extent items when comparing
    to the parent snapshot. This makes the send operation return -EIO and
    print an error message.
    
    Example reproducer:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
      $ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
    
      # Create our first file. The first half of the file has several 64Kb
      # extents while the second half as a single 512Kb extent.
      $ xfs_io -f -s -c "pwrite -S 0xb8 -b 64K 0 512K" /mnt/foo
      $ xfs_io -c "pwrite -S 0xb8 512K 512K" /mnt/foo
    
      # Create the base snapshot and the parent send stream from it.
      $ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt /mnt/mysnap1
      $ btrfs send -f /tmp/1.snap /mnt/mysnap1
    
      # Create our second file, that has exactly the same data as the first
      # file.
      $ xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xb8 0 1M" /mnt/bar
    
      # Create the second snapshot, used for the incremental send, before
      # doing the file deduplication.
      $ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt /mnt/mysnap2
    
      # Now before creating the incremental send stream:
      #
      # 1) Deduplicate into a subrange of file foo in snapshot mysnap1. This
      #    will drop several extent items and add a new one, also updating
      #    the inode's iversion (sequence field in inode item) by 1, but not
      #    any other field of the inode;
      #
      # 2) Deduplicate into a different subrange of file foo in snapshot
      #    mysnap2. This will replace an extent item with a new one, also
      #    updating the inode's iversion by 1 but not any other field of the
      #    inode.
      #
      # After these two deduplication operations, the inode items, for file
      # foo, are identical in both snapshots, but we have different extent
      # items for this inode in both snapshots. We want to check this doesn't
      # cause send to fail with an error or produce an incorrect stream.
    
      $ xfs_io -r -c "dedupe /mnt/bar 0 0 512K" /mnt/mysnap1/foo
      $ xfs_io -r -c "dedupe /mnt/bar 512K 512K 512K" /mnt/mysnap2/foo
    
      # Create the incremental send stream.
      $ btrfs send -p /mnt/mysnap1 -f /tmp/2.snap /mnt/mysnap2
      ERROR: send ioctl failed with -5: Input/output error
    
    This issue started happening back in 2015 when deduplication was updated
    to not update the inode's ctime and mtime and update only the iversion.
    Back then we would hit a BUG_ON() in send, but later in 2016 send was
    updated to return -EIO and print the error message instead of doing the
    BUG_ON().
    
    A test case for fstests follows soon.

    kbuild: initialize CLANG_FLAGS correctly in the top Makefile
    
    commit 5241ab4cf42d3a93b933b55d3d53f43049081fa1 upstream.
    
    CLANG_FLAGS is initialized by the following line:
    
      CLANG_FLAGS     := --target=$(notdir $(CROSS_COMPILE:%-=%))
    
    ..., which is run only when CROSS_COMPILE is set.
    
    Some build targets (bindeb-pkg etc.) recurse to the top Makefile.
    
    When you build the kernel with Clang but without CROSS_COMPILE,
    the same compiler flags such as -no-integrated-as are accumulated
    into CLANG_FLAGS.
    
    If you run 'make CC=clang' and then 'make CC=clang bindeb-pkg',
    Kbuild will recompile everything needlessly due to the build command
    change.
    
    Fix this by correctly initializing CLANG_FLAGS.

    drm/nouveau: fix memory leak in nouveau_conn_reset()
    
    [ Upstream commit 09b90e2fe35faeace2488234e2a7728f2ea8ba26 ]
    
    In nouveau_conn_reset(), if connector->state is true,
    __drm_atomic_helper_connector_destroy_state() will be called,
    but the memory pointed by asyc isn't freed. Memory leak happens
    in the following function __drm_atomic_helper_connector_reset(),
    where newly allocated asyc->state will be assigned to connector->state.
    
    So using nouveau_conn_atomic_destroy_state() instead of
    __drm_atomic_helper_connector_destroy_state to free the "old" asyc.
    
    Here the is the log showing memory leak.

    x86/kvm: Don't call kvm_spurious_fault() from .fixup
    
    [ Upstream commit 3901336ed9887b075531bffaeef7742ba614058b ]
    
    After making a change to improve objtool's sibling call detection, it
    started showing the following warning:
    
      arch/x86/kvm/vmx/nested.o: warning: objtool: .fixup+0x15: sibling call from callable instruction with modified stack frame
    
    The problem is the ____kvm_handle_fault_on_reboot() macro.  It does a
    fake call by pushing a fake RIP and doing a jump.  That tricks the
    unwinder into printing the function which triggered the exception,
    rather than the .fixup code.
    
    Instead of the hack to make it look like the original function made the
    call, just change the macro so that the original function actually does
    make the call.  This allows removal of the hack, and also makes objtool
    happy.
    
    I triggered a vmx instruction exception and verified that the stack
    trace is still sane:

    xen/pv: Fix a boot up hang revealed by int3 self test
    
    [ Upstream commit b23e5844dfe78a80ba672793187d3f52e4b528d7 ]
    
    Commit 7457c0da024b ("x86/alternatives: Add int3_emulate_call()
    selftest") is used to ensure there is a gap setup in int3 exception stack
    which could be used for inserting call return address.
    
    This gap is missed in XEN PV int3 exception entry path, then below panic
    triggered:

    For 64bit PV guests, Xen's ABI enters the kernel with using SYSRET, with
    %rcx/%r11 on the stack. To convert back to "normal" looking exceptions,
    the xen thunks do 'xen_*: pop %rcx; pop %r11; jmp *'.
    
    E.g. Extracting 'xen_pv_trap xenint3' we have:
    xen_xenint3:
     pop %rcx;
     pop %r11;
     jmp xenint3
    
    As xenint3 and int3 entry code are same except xenint3 doesn't generate
    a gap, we can fix it by using int3 and drop useless xenint3.

    ipc/mqueue.c: only perform resource calculation if user valid

    Which could be triggered by:
    
            struct mq_attr attr = {
                    .mq_flags = 0,
                    .mq_maxmsg = 9,
                    .mq_msgsize = 0x1fffffffffffffff,
                    .mq_curmsgs = 0,
            };
    
            if (mq_open("/testing", 0x40, 3, &attr) == (mqd_t) -1)
                    perror("mq_open");
    
    mqueue_get_inode() was correctly rejecting the giant mq_msgsize, and
    preparing to return -EINVAL.  During the cleanup, it calls
    mqueue_evict_inode() which performed resource usage tracking math for
    updating "user", before checking if there was a valid "user" at all
    (which would indicate that the calculations would be sane).  Instead,
    delay this check to after seeing a valid "user".
    
    The overflow was real, but the results went unused, so while the flaw is
    harmless, it's noisy for kernel fuzzers, so just fix it by moving the
    calculation under the non-NULL "user" where it actually gets used.

    The dev_info.name[] array has space for RIO_MAX_DEVNAME_SZ + 1
    characters.  But the problem here is that we don't ensure that the user
    put a NUL terminator on the end of the string.  It could lead to an out
    of bounds read.

    [ Upstream commit b2a57e334086602be56b74958d9f29b955cd157f ]
    
    The kernel is self-contained project and can be built with bare-metal
    toolchain.  But bare-metal toolchain doesn't define __linux__.  Because
    of this u_quad_t type is not defined when using bare-metal toolchain and
    codafs build fails.  This patch fixes it by defining u_quad_t type
    unconditionally.

    mm/cma.c: fail if fixed declaration can't be honored
    
    [ Upstream commit c633324e311243586675e732249339685e5d6faa ]
    
    The description of cma_declare_contiguous() indicates that if the
    'fixed' argument is true the reserved contiguous area must be exactly at
    the address of the 'base' argument.
    
    However, the function currently allows the 'base', 'size', and 'limit'
    arguments to be silently adjusted to meet alignment constraints.  This
    commit enforces the documented behavior through explicit checks that
    return an error if the region does not fit within a specified region.

    x86: math-emu: Hide clang warnings for 16-bit overflow
    
    [ Upstream commit 29e7e9664aec17b94a9c8c5a75f8d216a206aa3a ]
    
    clang warns about a few parts of the math-emu implementation

    x86/apic: Silence -Wtype-limits compiler warnings
    
    [ Upstream commit ec6335586953b0df32f83ef696002063090c7aef ]

    be2net: Signal that the device cannot transmit during reconfiguration
    
    [ Upstream commit 7429c6c0d9cb086d8e79f0d2a48ae14851d2115e ]
    
    While changing the number of interrupt channels, be2net stops adapter
    operation (including netif_tx_disable()) but it doesn't signal that it
    cannot transmit. This may lead dev_watchdog() to falsely trigger during
    that time.
    
    Add the missing call to netif_carrier_off(), following the pattern used in
    many other drivers. netif_carrier_on() is already taken care of in
    be_open().

    ACPI: fix false-positive -Wuninitialized warning
    
    [ Upstream commit dfd6f9ad36368b8dbd5f5a2b2f0a4705ae69a323 ]
    
    clang gets confused by an uninitialized variable in what looks
    to it like a never executed code path:
    
    arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c:618:13: error: variable 'polarity' is uninitialized when used here [-Werror,-Wuninitialized]
            polarity = polarity ? ACPI_ACTIVE_LOW : ACPI_ACTIVE_HIGH;
                       ^~~~~~~~
    arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c:606:32: note: initialize the variable 'polarity' to silence this warning
            int rc, irq, trigger, polarity;
                                          ^
                                           = 0
    arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c:617:12: error: variable 'trigger' is uninitialized when used here [-Werror,-Wuninitialized]
            trigger = trigger ? ACPI_LEVEL_SENSITIVE : ACPI_EDGE_SENSITIVE;

    arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c:606:22: note: initialize the variable 'trigger' to silence this warning
            int rc, irq, trigger, polarity;

                                 = 0
    
    This is unfortunately a design decision in clang and won't be fixed.
    
    Changing the acpi_get_override_irq() macro to an inline function
    reliably avoids the issue.

    scsi: zfcp: fix GCC compiler warning emitted with -Wmaybe-uninitialized
    
    [ Upstream commit 484647088826f2f651acbda6bcf9536b8a466703 ]
    
    GCC v9 emits this warning:
          CC      drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp_erp.o
        drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp_erp.c: In function 'zfcp_erp_action_enqueue':

              |                          ^~~~~~~~~~
    
    This is a possible false positive case, as also documented in the GCC
    documentations:
        https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wmaybe-uninitialized
    
    The actual code-sequence is like this:
        Various callers can invoke the function below with the argument "want"
        being one of:
        ZFCP_ERP_ACTION_REOPEN_ADAPTER,
        ZFCP_ERP_ACTION_REOPEN_PORT_FORCED,
        ZFCP_ERP_ACTION_REOPEN_PORT, or
        ZFCP_ERP_ACTION_REOPEN_LUN.
    
        zfcp_erp_action_enqueue(want, ...)
            ...
            need = zfcp_erp_required_act(want, ...)
                need = want
                ...
                maybe: need = ZFCP_ERP_ACTION_REOPEN_PORT
                maybe: need = ZFCP_ERP_ACTION_REOPEN_ADAPTER
                ...
                return need
            ...
            zfcp_erp_setup_act(need, ...)
                struct zfcp_erp_action *erp_action; // <== line 217
                ...
                switch(need) {
                case ZFCP_ERP_ACTION_REOPEN_LUN:
                        ...
                        erp_action = &zfcp_sdev->erp_action;
                        WARN_ON_ONCE(erp_action->port != port); // <== access
                        ...
                        break;
                case ZFCP_ERP_ACTION_REOPEN_PORT:
                case ZFCP_ERP_ACTION_REOPEN_PORT_FORCED:
                        ...
                        erp_action = &port->erp_action;
                        WARN_ON_ONCE(erp_action->port != port); // <== access
                        ...
                        break;
                case ZFCP_ERP_ACTION_REOPEN_ADAPTER:
                        ...
                        erp_action = &adapter->erp_action;
                        WARN_ON_ONCE(erp_action->port != NULL); // <== access
                        ...
                        break;
                }
                ...
                WARN_ON_ONCE(erp_action->adapter != adapter); // <== access
    
    When zfcp_erp_setup_act() is called, 'need' will never be anything else
    than one of the 4 possible enumeration-names that are used in the
    switch-case, and 'erp_action' is initialized for every one of them, before
    it is used. Thus the warning is a false positive, as documented.
    
    We introduce the extra if{} in the beginning to create an extra code-flow,
    so the compiler can be convinced that the switch-case will never see any
    other value.
    
    BUG_ON()/BUG() is intentionally not used to not crash anything, should
    this ever happen anyway - right now it's impossible, as argued above; and
    it doesn't introduce a 'default:' switch-case to retain warnings should
    'enum zfcp_erp_act_type' ever be extended and no explicit case be
    introduced. See also v5.0 commit 399b6c8bc9f7 ("scsi: zfcp: drop old
    default switch case which might paper over missing case").

    ceph: return -ERANGE if virtual xattr value didn't fit in buffer
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b421018f48c482bdc9650f894aa1747cf90e51d ]
    
    The getxattr manpage states that we should return ERANGE if the
    destination buffer size is too small to hold the value.
    ceph_vxattrcb_layout does this internally, but we should be doing
    this for all vxattrs.
    
    Fix the only caller of getxattr_cb to check the returned size
    against the buffer length and return -ERANGE if it doesn't fit.
    Drop the same check in ceph_vxattrcb_layout and just rely on the
    caller to handle it.

    cifs: Fix a race condition with cifs_echo_request
    
    [ Upstream commit f2caf901c1b7ce65f9e6aef4217e3241039db768 ]
    
    There is a race condition with how we send (or supress and don't send)
    smb echos that will cause the client to incorrectly think the
    server is unresponsive and thus needs to be reconnected.
    
    Summary of the race condition:
     1) Daisy chaining scheduling creates a gap.
     2) If traffic comes unfortunate shortly after
        the last echo, the planned echo is suppressed.
     3) Due to the gap, the next echo transmission is delayed
        until after the timeout, which is set hard to twice
        the echo interval.
    
    This is fixed by changing the timeouts from 2 to three times the echo interval.

    btrfs: fix minimum number of chunk errors for DUP
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ee5f8ae082e1f675a2fb6db601c31ac9958a134 ]
    
    The list of profiles in btrfs_chunk_max_errors lists DUP as a profile
    DUP able to tolerate 1 device missing. Though this profile is special

    clk: tegra210: fix PLLU and PLLU_OUT1
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d34dfbf3023cf119b83f6470692c0b10c832495 ]
    
    Full-speed and low-speed USB devices do not work with Tegra210
    platforms because of incorrect PLLU/PLLU_OUT1 clock settings.
    
    When full-speed device is connected:
    [   14.059886] usb 1-3: new full-speed USB device number 2 using tegra-xusb
    [   14.196295] usb 1-3: device descriptor read/64, error -71

    [   15.164799] usb usb1-port3: attempt power cycle
    
    When low-speed device is connected:

    This commit fixes the issue by:
     1. initializing PLLU_OUT1 before initializing XUSB_FS_SRC clock
        because PLLU_OUT1 is parent of XUSB_FS_SRC.
     2. changing PLLU post-divider to /2 (DIVP=1) according to Technical
        Reference Manual.

    dmaengine: rcar-dmac: Reject zero-length slave DMA requests
    
    [ Upstream commit 78efb76ab4dfb8f74f290ae743f34162cd627f19 ]
    
    While the .device_prep_slave_sg() callback rejects empty scatterlists,
    it still accepts single-entry scatterlists with a zero-length segment.
    These may happen if a driver calls dmaengine_prep_slave_single() with a
    zero len parameter.  The corresponding DMA request will never complete,
    leading to messages like:
    
        rcar-dmac e7300000.dma-controller: Channel Address Error happen
    
    and DMA timeouts.
    
    Although requesting a zero-length DMA request is a driver bug, rejecting
    it early eases debugging.  Note that the .device_prep_dma_memcpy()
    callback already rejects requests to copy zero bytes.

    kernel/module.c: Only return -EEXIST for modules that have finished loading
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e6de3dee51a439f76eb73c22ae2ffd2c9384712 ]
    
    Microsoft HyperV disables the X86_FEATURE_SMCA bit on AMD systems, and
    linux guests boot with repeated errors:
    
    amd64_edac_mod: Unknown symbol amd_unregister_ecc_decoder (err -2)
    amd64_edac_mod: Unknown symbol amd_register_ecc_decoder (err -2)
    amd64_edac_mod: Unknown symbol amd_report_gart_errors (err -2)
    amd64_edac_mod: Unknown symbol amd_unregister_ecc_decoder (err -2)
    amd64_edac_mod: Unknown symbol amd_register_ecc_decoder (err -2)
    amd64_edac_mod: Unknown symbol amd_report_gart_errors (err -2)
    
    The warnings occur because the module code erroneously returns -EEXIST
    for modules that have failed to load and are in the process of being
    removed from the module list.
    
    module amd64_edac_mod has a dependency on module edac_mce_amd.  Using
    modules.dep, systemd will load edac_mce_amd for every request of
    amd64_edac_mod.  When the edac_mce_amd module loads, the module has
    state MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED and once the module load fails and the state
    becomes MODULE_STATE_GOING.  Another request for edac_mce_amd module
    executes and add_unformed_module() will erroneously return -EEXIST even
    though the previous instance of edac_mce_amd has MODULE_STATE_GOING.
    Upon receiving -EEXIST, systemd attempts to load amd64_edac_mod, which
    fails because of unknown symbols from edac_mce_amd.
    
    add_unformed_module() must wait to return for any case other than
    MODULE_STATE_LIVE to prevent a race between multiple loads of
    dependent modules.

    ftrace: Enable trampoline when rec count returns back to one
    
    [ Upstream commit a124692b698b00026a58d89831ceda2331b2e1d0 ]
    
    Custom trampolines can only be enabled if there is only a single ops
    attached to it. If there's only a single callback registered to a function,
    and the ops has a trampoline registered for it, then we can call the
    trampoline directly. This is very useful for improving the performance of
    ftrace and livepatch.
    
    If more than one callback is registered to a function, the general
    trampoline is used, and the custom trampoline is not restored back to the
    direct call even if all the other callbacks were unregistered and we are
    back to one callback for the function.
    
    To fix this, set FTRACE_FL_TRAMP flag if rec count is decremented
    to one, and the ops that left has a trampoline.
    
    Testing After this patch :
    
    insmod livepatch_unshare_files.ko
    cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/enabled_functions
    
            unshare_files (1) R I   tramp: 0xffffffffc0000000(klp_ftrace_handler+0x0/0xa0) ->ftrace_ops_assist_func+0x0/0xf0

    ARM: dts: rockchip: Mark that the rk3288 timer might stop in suspend
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ef1ba39a9fa53d2205e633bc9b21840a275908e ]
    
    This is similar to commit e6186820a745 ("arm64: dts: rockchip: Arch
    counter doesn't tick in system suspend").  Specifically on the rk3288
    it can be seen that the timer stops ticking in suspend if we end up
    running through the "osc_disable" path in rk3288_slp_mode_set().  In
    that path the 24 MHz clock will turn off and the timer stops.
    
    To test this, I ran this on a Chrome OS filesystem:
      before=$(date); \
      suspend_stress_test -c1 --suspend_min=30 --suspend_max=31; \
      echo ${before}; date
    
    ...and I found that unless I plug in a device that requests USB wakeup
    to be active that the two calls to "date" would show that fewer than
    30 seconds passed.
    
    NOTE: deep suspend (where the 24 MHz clock gets disabled) isn't
    supported yet on upstream Linux so this was tested on a downstream
    kernel.

    ARM: dts: rockchip: Make rk3288-veyron-mickey's emmc work again
    
    [ Upstream commit 99fa066710f75f18f4d9a5bc5f6a711968a581d5 ]
    
    When I try to boot rk3288-veyron-mickey I totally fail to make the
    eMMC work.  Specifically my logs (on Chrome OS 4.19):
    
      mmc_host mmc1: card is non-removable.
      mmc_host mmc1: Bus speed (slot 0) = 400000Hz (slot req 400000Hz, actual 400000HZ div = 0)

      ...
    
    When I remove the '/delete-property/mmc-hs200-1_8v' then everything is
    hunky dory.
    
    That line comes from the original submission of the mickey dts
    upstream, so presumably at the time the HS200 was failing and just
    enumerating things as a high speed device was fine.  ...or maybe it's
    just that some mickey devices work when enumerating at "high speed",
    just not mine?
    
    In any case, hs200 seems good now.  Let's turn it on.

    [ Upstream commit 1c0479023412ab7834f2e98b796eb0d8c627cd62 ]
    
    As some point hs200 was failing on rk3288-veyron-minnie.  See commit
    984926781122 ("ARM: dts: rockchip: temporarily remove emmc hs200 speed
    from rk3288 minnie").  Although I didn't track down exactly when it
    started working, it seems to work OK now, so let's turn it back on.
    
    To test this, I booted from SD card and then used this script to
    stress the enumeration process after fixing a memory leak [1]:
      cd /sys/bus/platform/drivers/dwmmc_rockchip
      for i in $(seq 1 3000); do
        echo "========================" $i

        echo ff0f0000.dwmmc > bind
        while true; do
          if [ -e /dev/mmcblk2 ]; then
            break;
          fi
          sleep .1
        done
      done
    
    It worked fine.

    DMA got broken a while back in two different ways:
    1) a change in the behaviour of disable_irq() to wait for the interrupt
       to finish executing causes us to deadlock at the end of DMA.
    2) a change to avoid modifying the scatterlist left the first transfer
       uninitialised.
    
    DMA is only used with expansion cards, so has gone unnoticed.
