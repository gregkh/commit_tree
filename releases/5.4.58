    nfsd: Fix NFSv4 READ on RDMA when using readv
    
    commit 412055398b9e67e07347a936fc4a6adddabe9cf4 upstream.
    
    svcrdma expects that the payload falls precisely into the xdr_buf
    page vector. This does not seem to be the case for
    nfsd4_encode_readv().
    
    This code is called only when fops->splice_read is missing or when
    RQ_SPLICE_OK is clear, so it's not a noticeable problem in many
    common cases.
    
    Add new transport method: ->xpo_read_payload so that when a READ
    payload does not fit exactly in rq_res's page vector, the XDR
    encoder can inform the RPC transport exactly where that payload is,
    without the payload's XDR pad.
    
    That way, when a Write chunk is present, the transport knows what
    byte range in the Reply message is supposed to be matched with the
    chunk.
    
    Note that the Linux NFS server implementation of NFS/RDMA can
    currently handle only one Write chunk per RPC-over-RDMA message.
    This simplifies the implementation of this fix.

    ima: move APPRAISE_BOOTPARAM dependency on ARCH_POLICY to runtime
    
    commit 311aa6aafea446c2f954cc19d66425bfed8c4b0b upstream.
    
    The IMA_APPRAISE_BOOTPARAM config allows enabling different "ima_appraise="
    modes - log, fix, enforce - at run time, but not when IMA architecture
    specific policies are enabled.  This prevents properly labeling the
    filesystem on systems where secure boot is supported, but not enabled on the
    platform.  Only when secure boot is actually enabled should these IMA
    appraise modes be disabled.
    
    This patch removes the compile time dependency and makes it a runtime
    decision, based on the secure boot state of that platform.
    
    Test results as follows:
    
    -> x86-64 with secure boot enabled
    
    [    0.015637] Kernel command line: <...> ima_policy=appraise_tcb ima_appraise=fix
    [    0.015668] ima: Secure boot enabled: ignoring ima_appraise=fix boot parameter option
    
    -> powerpc with secure boot disabled
    
    [    0.000000] Kernel command line: <...> ima_policy=appraise_tcb ima_appraise=fix
    [    0.000000] Secure boot mode disabled
    
    -> Running the system without secure boot and with both options set:
    
    CONFIG_IMA_APPRAISE_BOOTPARAM=y
    CONFIG_IMA_ARCH_POLICY=y
    
    Audit prompts "missing-hash" but still allow execution and, consequently,
    filesystem labeling:

    tcp: apply a floor of 1 for RTT samples from TCP timestamps
    
    [ Upstream commit 730e700e2c19d87e578ff0e7d8cb1d4a02b036d2 ]
    
    For retransmitted packets, TCP needs to resort to using TCP timestamps
    for computing RTT samples. In the common case where the data and ACK
    fall in the same 1-millisecond interval, TCP senders with millisecond-
    granularity TCP timestamps compute a ca_rtt_us of 0. This ca_rtt_us
    of 0 propagates to rs->rtt_us.
    
    This value of 0 can cause performance problems for congestion control
    modules. For example, in BBR, the zero min_rtt sample can bring the
    min_rtt and BDP estimate down to 0, reduce snd_cwnd and result in a
    low throughput. It would be hard to mitigate this with filtering in
    the congestion control module, because the proper floor to apply would
    depend on the method of RTT sampling (using timestamp options or
    internally-saved transmission timestamps).
    
    This fix applies a floor of 1 for the RTT sample delta from TCP
    timestamps, so that seq_rtt_us, ca_rtt_us, and rs->rtt_us will be at
    least 1 * (USEC_PER_SEC / TCP_TS_HZ).
    
    Note that the receiver RTT computation in tcp_rcv_rtt_measure() and
    min_rtt computation in tcp_update_rtt_min() both already apply a floor
    of 1 timestamp tick, so this commit makes the code more consistent in
    avoiding this edge case of a value of 0.

    selftests/net: relax cpu affinity requirement in msg_zerocopy test
    
    [ Upstream commit 16f6458f2478b55e2b628797bc81a4455045c74e ]
    
    The msg_zerocopy test pins the sender and receiver threads to separate
    cores to reduce variance between runs.
    
    But it hardcodes the cores and skips core 0, so it fails on machines
    with the selected cores offline, or simply fewer cores.
    
    The test mainly gives code coverage in automated runs. The throughput
    of zerocopy ('-z') and non-zerocopy runs is logged for manual
    inspection.
    
    Continue even when sched_setaffinity fails. Just log to warn anyone
    interpreting the data.

    Revert "vxlan: fix tos value before xmit"
    
    [ Upstream commit a0dced17ad9dc08b1b25e0065b54c97a318e6e8b ]
    
    This reverts commit 71130f29979c7c7956b040673e6b9d5643003176.
    
    In commit 71130f29979c ("vxlan: fix tos value before xmit") we want to
    make sure the tos value are filtered by RT_TOS() based on RFC1349.
    
           0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        |   PRECEDENCE    |          TOS          | MBZ |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    
    But RFC1349 has been obsoleted by RFC2474. The new DSCP field defined like
    
           0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        |          DS FIELD, DSCP           | ECN FIELD |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    
    So with
    
    IPTOS_TOS_MASK          0x1E
    RT_TOS(tos)             ((tos)&IPTOS_TOS_MASK)
    
    the first 3 bits DSCP info will get lost.
    
    To take all the DSCP info in xmit, we should revert the patch and just push
    all tos bits to ip_tunnel_ecn_encap(), which will handling ECN field later.

    net: thunderx: use spin_lock_bh in nicvf_set_rx_mode_task()
    
    [ Upstream commit bab9693a9a8c6dd19f670408ec1e78e12a320682 ]
    
    A dead lock was triggered on thunderx driver:
    
            CPU0                    CPU1
            ----                    ----
       [01] lock(&(&nic->rx_mode_wq_lock)->rlock);
                               [11] lock(&(&mc->mca_lock)->rlock);
                               [12] lock(&(&nic->rx_mode_wq_lock)->rlock);
       [02] <Interrupt> lock(&(&mc->mca_lock)->rlock);
    
    The path for each is:
    
      [01] worker_thread() -> process_one_work() -> nicvf_set_rx_mode_task()
      [02] mld_ifc_timer_expire()
      [11] ipv6_add_dev() -> ipv6_dev_mc_inc() -> igmp6_group_added() ->
      [12] dev_mc_add() -> __dev_set_rx_mode() -> nicvf_set_rx_mode()
    
    To fix it, it needs to disable bh on [1], so that the timer on [2]
    wouldn't be triggered until rx_mode_wq_lock is released. So change
    to use spin_lock_bh() instead of spin_lock().
    
    Thanks to Paolo for helping with this.

    [ Upstream commit 622e32b7d4a6492cf5c1f759ef833f817418f7b3 ]
    
    The GRE tunnel can be used to transport traffic that does not rely on a
    Internet checksum (e.g. SCTP). The issue can be triggered creating a GRE
    or GRETAP tunnel and transmitting SCTP traffic ontop of it where CRC
    offload has been disabled. In order to fix the issue we need to
    recompute the GRE csum in gre_gso_segment() not relying on the inner
    checksum.
    The issue is still present when we have the CRC offload enabled.
    In this case we need to disable the CRC offload if we require GRE
    checksum since otherwise skb_checksum() will report a wrong value.

    vxlan: Ensure FDB dump is performed under RCU
    
    [ Upstream commit b5141915b5aec3b29a63db869229e3741ebce258 ]
    
    The commit cited below removed the RCU read-side critical section from
    rtnl_fdb_dump() which means that the ndo_fdb_dump() callback is invoked
    without RCU protection.
    
    This results in the following warning [1] in the VXLAN driver, which
    relied on the callback being invoked from an RCU read-side critical
    section.
    
    Fix this by calling rcu_read_lock() in the VXLAN driver, as already done
    in the bridge driver.

    rxrpc: Fix race between recvmsg and sendmsg on immediate call failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 65550098c1c4db528400c73acf3e46bfa78d9264 ]
    
    There's a race between rxrpc_sendmsg setting up a call, but then failing to
    send anything on it due to an error, and recvmsg() seeing the call
    completion occur and trying to return the state to the user.
    
    An assertion fails in rxrpc_recvmsg() because the call has already been
    released from the socket and is about to be released again as recvmsg deals
    with it.  (The recvmsg_q queue on the socket holds a ref, so there's no
    problem with use-after-free.)
    
    We also have to be careful not to end up reporting an error twice, in such
    a way that both returns indicate to userspace that the user ID supplied
    with the call is no longer in use - which could cause the client to
    malfunction if it recycles the user ID fast enough.
    
    Fix this by the following means:
    
     (1) When sendmsg() creates a call after the point that the call has been
         successfully added to the socket, don't return any errors through
         sendmsg(), but rather complete the call and let recvmsg() retrieve
         them.  Make sendmsg() return 0 at this point.  Further calls to
         sendmsg() for that call will fail with ESHUTDOWN.
    
         Note that at this point, we haven't send any packets yet, so the
         server doesn't yet know about the call.
    
     (2) If sendmsg() returns an error when it was expected to create a new
         call, it means that the user ID wasn't used.
    
     (3) Mark the call disconnected before marking it completed to prevent an
         oops in rxrpc_release_call().
    
     (4) recvmsg() will then retrieve the error and set MSG_EOR to indicate
         that the user ID is no longer known by the kernel.
    
    An oops like the following is produced:

    ipv6: Fix nexthop refcnt leak when creating ipv6 route info
    
    [ Upstream commit 706ec919164622ff5ce822065472d0f30a9e9dd2 ]
    
    ip6_route_info_create() invokes nexthop_get(), which increases the
    refcount of the "nh".
    
    When ip6_route_info_create() returns, local variable "nh" becomes
    invalid, so the refcount should be decreased to keep refcount balanced.
    
    The reference counting issue happens in one exception handling path of
    ip6_route_info_create(). When nexthops can not be used with source
    routing, the function forgets to decrease the refcnt increased by
    nexthop_get(), causing a refcnt leak.
    
    Fix this issue by pulling up the error source routing handling when
    nexthops can not be used with source routing.

    ipv6: fix memory leaks on IPV6_ADDRFORM path
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c0de6e96c9794cb523a516c465991a70245da1c ]
    
    IPV6_ADDRFORM causes resource leaks when converting an IPv6 socket
    to IPv4, particularly struct ipv6_ac_socklist. Similar to
    struct ipv6_mc_socklist, we should just close it on this path.
    
    This bug can be easily reproduced with the following C program:
    
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <string.h>
      #include <sys/types.h>
      #include <sys/socket.h>
      #include <arpa/inet.h>
    
      int main()
      {
        int s, value;
        struct sockaddr_in6 addr;
        struct ipv6_mreq m6;
    
        s = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
        addr.sin6_family = AF_INET6;
        addr.sin6_port = htons(5000);
        inet_pton(AF_INET6, "::ffff:192.168.122.194", &addr.sin6_addr);
        connect(s, (struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr));
    
        inet_pton(AF_INET6, "fe80::AAAA", &m6.ipv6mr_multiaddr);
        m6.ipv6mr_interface = 5;
        setsockopt(s, SOL_IPV6, IPV6_JOIN_ANYCAST, &m6, sizeof(m6));
    
        value = AF_INET;
        setsockopt(s, SOL_IPV6, IPV6_ADDRFORM, &value, sizeof(value));
    
        close(s);

    ipv4: Silence suspicious RCU usage warning
    
    [ Upstream commit 83f3522860f702748143e022f1a546547314c715 ]
    
    fib_trie_unmerge() is called with RTNL held, but not from an RCU
    read-side critical section. This leads to the following warning [1] when
    the FIB alias list in a leaf is traversed with
    hlist_for_each_entry_rcu().
    
    Since the function is always called with RTNL held and since
    modification of the list is protected by RTNL, simply use
    hlist_for_each_entry() and silence the warning.

    PCI: tegra: Revert tegra124 raw_violation_fixup
    
    commit e7b856dfcec6d3bf028adee8c65342d7035914a1 upstream.
    
    As reported in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/206217 , raw_violation_fixup
    is causing more harm than good in some common use-cases.
    
    This patch is a partial revert of commit:
    
    191cd6fb5d2c ("PCI: tegra: Add SW fixup for RAW violations")
    
    and fixes the following regression since then.
    
    * Description:
    
    When both the NIC and MMC are used one can see the following message:
    
      NETDEV WATCHDOG: enp1s0 (r8169): transmit queue 0 timed out
    
    and
    
      pcieport 0000:00:02.0: AER: Uncorrected (Non-Fatal) error received: 0000:01:00.0
      r8169 0000:01:00.0: AER: PCIe Bus Error: severity=Uncorrected (Non-Fatal), type=Transaction Layer, (Requester ID)
      r8169 0000:01:00.0: AER:   device [10ec:8168] error status/mask=00004000/00400000
      r8169 0000:01:00.0: AER:    [14] CmpltTO                (First)
      r8169 0000:01:00.0: AER: can't recover (no error_detected callback)
      pcieport 0000:00:02.0: AER: device recovery failed
    
    After that, the ethernet NIC is not functional anymore even after
    reloading the r8169 module. After a reboot, this is reproducible by
    copying a large file over the NIC to the MMC.
    
    For some reason this is not reproducible when files are copied to a tmpfs.
    
    * Little background on the fixup, by Manikanta Maddireddy:
      "In the internal testing with dGPU on Tegra124, CmplTO is reported by
    dGPU. This happened because FIFO queue in AFI(AXI to PCIe) module
    get full by upstream posted writes. Back to back upstream writes
    interleaved with infrequent reads, triggers RAW violation and CmpltTO.
    This is fixed by reducing the posted write credits and by changing
    updateFC timer frequency. These settings are fixed after stress test.
    
    In the current case, RTL NIC is also reporting CmplTO. These settings
    seems to be aggravating the issue instead of fixing it."

    This commit moved too much work in kasan_init(). The allocation
    of shadow pages has to be moved for the reason explained in that
    patch, but the allocation of page tables still need to be done
    before switching to the final hash table.

    xattr: break delegations in {set,remove}xattr
    
    commit 08b5d5014a27e717826999ad20e394a8811aae92 upstream.
    
    set/removexattr on an exported filesystem should break NFS delegations.
    This is true in general, but also for the upcoming support for
    RFC 8726 (NFSv4 extended attribute support). Make sure that they do.
    
    Additionally, they need to grow a _locked variant, since callers might
    call this with i_rwsem held (like the NFS server code).

    Drivers: hv: vmbus: Ignore CHANNELMSG_TL_CONNECT_RESULT(23)
    
    [ Upstream commit ddc9d357b991838c2d975e8d7e4e9db26f37a7ff ]
    
    When a Linux hv_sock app tries to connect to a Service GUID on which no
    host app is listening, a recent host (RS3+) sends a
    CHANNELMSG_TL_CONNECT_RESULT (23) message to Linux and this triggers such
    a warning:
    
    unknown msgtype=23
    WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 0 at drivers/hv/vmbus_drv.c:1031 vmbus_on_msg_dpc
    
    Actually Linux can safely ignore the message because the Linux app's
    connect() will time out in 2 seconds: see VSOCK_DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT
    and vsock_stream_connect(). We don't bother to make use of the message
    because: 1) it's only supported on recent hosts; 2) a non-trivial effort
    is required to use the message in Linux, but the benefit is small.
    
    So, let's not see the warning by silently ignoring the message.

    tools lib traceevent: Fix memory leak in process_dynamic_array_len
    
    [ Upstream commit e24c6447ccb7b1a01f9bf0aec94939e6450c0b4d ]
    
    I compiled with AddressSanitizer and I had these memory leaks while I
    was using the tep_parse_format function:
    
        Direct leak of 28 byte(s) in 4 object(s) allocated from:

    The token variable in the process_dynamic_array_len function is
    allocated in the read_expect_type function, but is not freed before
    calling the read_token function.
    
    Free the token variable before calling read_token in order to plug the
    leak.

    atm: fix atm_dev refcnt leaks in atmtcp_remove_persistent
    
    [ Upstream commit 51875dad43b44241b46a569493f1e4bfa0386d86 ]
    
    atmtcp_remove_persistent() invokes atm_dev_lookup(), which returns a
    reference of atm_dev with increased refcount or NULL if fails.
    
    The refcount leaks issues occur in two error handling paths. If
    dev_data->persist is zero or PRIV(dev)->vcc isn't NULL, the function
    returns 0 without decreasing the refcount kept by a local variable,
    resulting in refcount leaks.
    
    Fix the issue by adding atm_dev_put() before returning 0 both when
    dev_data->persist is zero or PRIV(dev)->vcc isn't NULL.

    [ Upstream commit 024a8168b749db7a4aa40a5fbdfa04bf7e77c1c0 ]
    
    We observed two panics involving races with igb_reset_task.
    The first panic is caused by this race condition:

    cfg80211: check vendor command doit pointer before use
    
    [ Upstream commit 4052d3d2e8f47a15053320bbcbe365d15610437d ]
    
    In the case where a vendor command does not implement doit, and has no
    flags set, doit would not be validated and a NULL pointer dereference
    would occur, for example when invoking the vendor command via iw.
    
    I encountered this while developing new vendor commands.  Perhaps in
    practice it is advisable to always implement doit along with dumpit,
    but it seems reasonable to me to always check doit anyway, not just
    when NEED_WDEV.

    ALSA: hda: fix NULL pointer dereference during suspend
    
    [ Upstream commit 7fcd9bb5acd01250bcae1ecc0cb8b8d4bb5b7e63 ]
    
    When the ASoC card registration fails and the codec component driver
    never probes, the codec device is not initialized and therefore
    memory for codec->wcaps is not allocated. This results in a NULL pointer
    dereference when the codec driver suspend callback is invoked during
    system suspend. Fix this by returning without performing any actions
    during codec suspend/resume if the card was not registered successfully.

    drm/drm_fb_helper: fix fbdev with sparc64
    
    [ Upstream commit 2a1658bf922ffd9b7907e270a7d9cdc9643fc45d ]
    
    Recent kernels have been reported to panic using the bochs_drm
    framebuffer under qemu-system-sparc64 which was bisected to
    commit 7a0483ac4ffc ("drm/bochs: switch to generic drm fbdev emulation").
    
    The backtrace indicates that the shadow framebuffer copy in
    drm_fb_helper_dirty_blit_real() is trying to access the real
    framebuffer using a virtual address rather than use an IO access
    typically implemented using a physical (ASI_PHYS) access on SPARC.
    
    The fix is to replace the memcpy with memcpy_toio() from io.h.
    
    memcpy_toio() uses writeb() where the original fbdev code
    used sbus_memcpy_toio(). The latter uses sbus_writeb().
    
    The difference between writeb() and sbus_memcpy_toio() is
    that writeb() writes bytes in little-endian, where sbus_writeb() writes
    bytes in big-endian. As endian does not matter for byte writes they are
    the same. So we can safely use memcpy_toio() here.
    
    Note that this only fixes bochs, in general fbdev helpers still have
    issues with mixing up system memory and __iomem space. Fixing that will
    require a lot more work.
    
    v3:
      - Improved changelog (Daniel)
      - Added FIXME to fbdev_use_iomem (Daniel)
    
    v2:
      - Added missing __iomem cast (kernel test robot)
      - Made changelog readable and fix typos (Mark)
      - Add flag to select iomem - and set it in the bochs driver

    nvme-pci: prevent SK hynix PC400 from using Write Zeroes command
    
    [ Upstream commit 5611ec2b9814bc91f7b0a8d804c1fc152e2025d9 ]
    
    After commit 6e02318eaea5 ("nvme: add support for the Write Zeroes
    command"), SK hynix PC400 becomes very slow with the following error
    message:
    
    [  224.567695] blk_update_request: operation not supported error, dev nvme1n1, sector 499384320 op 0x9:(WRITE_ZEROES) flags 0x1000000 phys_seg 0 prio class 0]
    
    SK Hynix PC400 has a buggy firmware that treats NLB as max value instead
    of a range, so the NLB passed isn't a valid value to the firmware.
    
    According to SK hynix there are three commands are affected:
    - Write Zeroes
    - Compare
    - Write Uncorrectable
    
    Right now only Write Zeroes is implemented, so disable it completely on
    SK hynix PC400.

    net/9p: validate fds in p9_fd_open
    
    [ Upstream commit a39c46067c845a8a2d7144836e9468b7f072343e ]
    
    p9_fd_open just fgets file descriptors passed in from userspace, but
    doesn't verify that they are valid for read or writing.  This gets
    cought down in the VFS when actually attempting a read or write, but
    a new warning added in linux-next upsets syzcaller.
    
    Fix this by just verifying the fds early on.

    Several MFD child drivers register their class devices directly under

    so that deregistration ends up being tied to the parent device,

    When doing a "write" ioctl call, properly check that we have permissions
    to do so before copying anything from userspace or anything else so we
    can "fail fast".  This includes also covering the MEMWRITE ioctl which

    vgacon: Fix for missing check in scrollback handling
    
    commit ebfdfeeae8c01fcb2b3b74ffaf03876e20835d2d upstream.
    
    vgacon_scrollback_update() always leaves enbough room in the scrollback
    buffer for the next call, but if the console size changed that room
    might not actually be enough, and so we need to re-check.
    
    The check should be in the loop since vgacon_scrollback_cur->tail is
    updated in the loop and count may be more than 1 when triggered by CSI M,
    as Jiri's PoC:
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <sys/stat.h>
    #include <sys/ioctl.h>
    #include <fcntl.h>
    
    int main(int argc, char** argv)
    {
            int fd = open("/dev/tty1", O_RDWR);
            unsigned short size[3] = {25, 200, 0};
            ioctl(fd, 0x5609, size); // VT_RESIZE
    
            write(fd, "\e[1;1H", 6);
            for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++)
                    write(fd, "\e[10M", 5);
    }
    
    It leads to various crashes as vgacon_scrollback_update writes out of
    the buffer:
     BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffc900001752a0
     #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode
     #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page
     RIP: 0010:mutex_unlock+0x13/0x30
    ...
     Call Trace:
      n_tty_write+0x1a0/0x4d0
      tty_write+0x1a0/0x2e0
    
    Or to KASAN reports:

    scripts: add dummy report mode to add_namespace.cocci
    
    commit 55c7549819e438f40a3ef1d8ac5c38b73390bcb7 upstream.
    
    When running `make coccicheck` in report mode using the
    add_namespace.cocci file, it will fail for files that contain
    MODULE_LICENSE. Those match the replacement precondition, but spatch
    errors out as virtual.ns is not set.
    
    In order to fix that, add the virtual rule nsdeps and only do search and
    replace if that rule has been explicitly requested.
    
    In order to make spatch happy in report mode, we also need a dummy rule,
    as otherwise it errors out with "No rules apply". Using a script:python
    rule appears unrelated and odd, but this is the shortest I could come up
    with.
    
    Adjust scripts/nsdeps accordingly to set the nsdeps rule when run trough
    `make nsdeps`.

    Smack: fix use-after-free in smk_write_relabel_self()
    
    commit beb4ee6770a89646659e6a2178538d2b13e2654e upstream.
    
    smk_write_relabel_self() frees memory from the task's credentials with
    no locking, which can easily cause a use-after-free because multiple
    tasks can share the same credentials structure.

    the task's credentials.

    binder: Prevent context manager from incrementing ref 0
    
    commit 4b836a1426cb0f1ef2a6e211d7e553221594f8fc upstream.
    
    Binder is designed such that a binder_proc never has references to
    itself. If this rule is violated, memory corruption can occur when a
    process sends a transaction to itself; see e.g.
    <https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=09e05aba06723a94d43d>.
    
    There is a remaining edgecase through which such a transaction-to-self
    can still occur from the context of a task with BINDER_SET_CONTEXT_MGR
    access:
    
     - task A opens /dev/binder twice, creating binder_proc instances P1
       and P2
     - P1 becomes context manager
     - P2 calls ACQUIRE on the magic handle 0, allocating index 0 in its
       handle table
     - P1 dies (by closing the /dev/binder fd and waiting a bit)
     - P2 becomes context manager
     - P2 calls ACQUIRE on the magic handle 0, allocating index 1 in its
       handle table
       [this triggers a warning: "binder: 1974:1974 tried to acquire
       reference to desc 0, got 1 instead"]
     - task B opens /dev/binder once, creating binder_proc instance P3
     - P3 calls P2 (via magic handle 0) with (void*)1 as argument (two-way
       transaction)
     - P2 receives the handle and uses it to call P3 (two-way transaction)
     - P3 calls P2 (via magic handle 0) (two-way transaction)
     - P2 calls P2 (via handle 1) (two-way transaction)
    
    And then, if P2 does *NOT* accept the incoming transaction work, but
    instead closes the binder fd, we get a crash.
    
    Solve it by preventing the context manager from using ACQUIRE on ref 0.
    There shouldn't be any legitimate reason for the context manager to do
    that.
    
    Additionally, print a warning if someone manages to find another way to
    trigger a transaction-to-self bug in the future.

    omapfb: dss: Fix max fclk divider for omap36xx
    
    commit 254503a2b186caa668a188dbbd7ab0d25149c0a5 upstream.
    
    The drm/omap driver was fixed to correct an issue where using a
    divider of 32 breaks the DSS despite the TRM stating 32 is a valid
    number.  Through experimentation, it appears that 31 works, and
    it is consistent with the value used by the drm/omap driver.
    
    This patch fixes the divider for fbdev driver instead of the drm.

    large `num_rsp` number makes hci_extended_inquiry_result_evt() go out
    of bounds. Fix it.
    
    This patch fixes the following syzbot bug:

    Staging: rtl8188eu: rtw_mlme: Fix uninitialized variable authmode
    
    commit 11536442a3b4e1de6890ea5e805908debb74f94a upstream.
    
    The variable authmode can be uninitialized. The danger would be if
    it equals to _WPA_IE_ID_ (0xdd) or _WPA2_IE_ID_ (0x33). We can avoid
    this by setting it to zero instead. This is the approach that was
    used in the rtl8723bs driver.

    staging: android: ashmem: Fix lockdep warning for write operation
    
    commit 3e338d3c95c735dc3265a86016bb4c022ec7cadc upstream.
    
    syzbot report [1] describes a deadlock when write operation against an
    ashmem fd executed at the time when ashmem is shrinking its cache results
    in the following lock sequence:
    
    Possible unsafe locking scenario:
    
            CPU0                    CPU1
            ----                    ----
       lock(fs_reclaim);
                                    lock(&sb->s_type->i_mutex_key#13);
                                    lock(fs_reclaim);
       lock(&sb->s_type->i_mutex_key#13);
    
    kswapd takes fs_reclaim and then inode_lock while generic_perform_write
    takes inode_lock and then fs_reclaim. However ashmem does not support
    writing into backing shmem with a write syscall. The only way to change
    its content is to mmap it and operate on mapped memory. Therefore the race
    that lockdep is warning about is not valid. Resolve this by introducing a
    separate lockdep class for the backing shmem inodes.

    ALSA: seq: oss: Serialize ioctls
    
    commit 80982c7e834e5d4e325b6ce33757012ecafdf0bb upstream.
    
    Some ioctls via OSS sequencer API may race and lead to UAF when the
    port create and delete are performed concurrently, as spotted by a
    couple of syzkaller cases.  This patch is an attempt to address it by
    serializing the ioctls with the existing register_mutex.
    
    Basically OSS sequencer API is an obsoleted interface and was designed
    without much consideration of the concurrency.  There are very few
    applications with it, and the concurrent performance isn't asked,
    hence this "big hammer" approach should be good enough.

    usb: xhci: Fix ASMedia ASM1142 DMA addressing
    
    commit ec37198acca7b4c17b96247697406e47aafe0605 upstream.
    
    I've confirmed that the ASMedia ASM1142 has the same problem as the
    ASM2142/ASM3142, in that it too reports that it supports 64-bit DMA
    addresses when in fact it does not. As with the ASM2142/ASM3142, this
    can cause problems on systems where the upper bits matter, and adding
    the XHCI_NO_64BIT_SUPPORT quirk completely fixes the issue.
