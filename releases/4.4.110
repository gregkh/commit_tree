    kaiser: Set _PAGE_NX only if supported
    
    This resolves a crash if loaded under qemu + haxm under windows.
    See https://www.spinics.net/lists/kernel/msg2689835.html for details.
    Here is a boot log (the log is from chromeos-4.4, but Tao Wu says that
    the same log is also seen with vanilla v4.4.110-rc1).

    The crash part of this problem may be solved with the following patch
    (thanks to Hugh for the hint). There is still another problem, though -
    with this patch applied, the qemu session aborts with "VCPU Shutdown
    request", whatever that means.

    x86/kasan: Clear kasan_zero_page after TLB flush
    
    commit 69e0210fd01ff157d332102219aaf5c26ca8069b upstream.
    
    Currently we clear kasan_zero_page before __flush_tlb_all(). This
    works with current implementation of native_flush_tlb[_global]()
    because it doesn't cause do any writes to kasan shadow memory.
    But any subtle change made in native_flush_tlb*() could break this.
    Also current code seems doesn't work for paravirt guests (lguest).
    
    Only after the TLB flush we can be sure that kasan_zero_page is not
    used as early shadow anymore (instrumented code will not write to it).
    So it should cleared it only after the TLB flush.

    x86, vdso, pvclock: Simplify and speed up the vdso pvclock reader
    
    commit 6b078f5de7fc0851af4102493c7b5bb07e49c4cb upstream.
    
    The pvclock vdso code was too abstracted to understand easily
    and excessively paranoid.  Simplify it for a huge speedup.
    
    This opens the door for additional simplifications, as the vdso
    no longer accesses the pvti for any vcpu other than vcpu 0.
    
    Before, vclock_gettime using kvm-clock took about 45ns on my
    machine. With this change, it takes 29ns, which is almost as
    fast as the pure TSC implementation.

    kaiser: disabled on Xen PV
    
    
    Kaiser cannot be used on paravirtualized MMUs (namely reading and writing CR3).
    This does not work with KAISER as the CR3 switch from and to user space PGD
    would require to map the whole XEN_PV machinery into both.
    
    More importantly, enabling KAISER on Xen PV doesn't make too much sense, as PV
    guests use distinct %cr3 values for kernel and user already.

    commit a035795499ca1c2bd1928808d1a156eda1420383 upstream
    
    native_flush_tlb_single() will be changed with the upcoming
    PAGE_TABLE_ISOLATION feature. This requires to have more code in
    there than INVLPG.
    
    Remove the paravirt patching for it.

    kaiser: asm/tlbflush.h handle noPGE at lower level
    
    
    I found asm/tlbflush.h too twisty, and think it safer not to avoid
    __native_flush_tlb_global_irq_disabled() in the kaiser_enabled case,
    but instead let it handle kaiser_enabled along with cr3: it can just
    use __native_flush_tlb() for that, no harm in re-disabling preemption.
    
    (This is not the same change as Kirill and Dave have suggested for
    upstream, flipping PGE in cr4: that's neat, but needs a cpu_has_pge
    check; cr3 is enough for kaiser, and thought to be cheaper than cr4.)
    
    Also delete the X86_FEATURE_INVPCID invpcid_flush_all_nonglobals()
    preference from __native_flush_tlb(): unlike the invpcid_flush_all()
    preference in __native_flush_tlb_global(), it's not seen in upstream
    4.14, and was recently reported to be surprisingly slow.

    of trouble: so just delete the walk's is_atomic arg and might_sleep().

    kaiser: use ALTERNATIVE instead of x86_cr3_pcid_noflush
    
    
    Now that we're playing the ALTERNATIVE game, use that more efficient
    method: instead of user-mapping an extra page, and reading an extra
    cacheline each time for x86_cr3_pcid_noflush.
    
    Neel has found that __stringify(bts $X86_CR3_PCID_NOFLUSH_BIT, %rax)
    is a working substitute for the "bts $63, %rax" in these ALTERNATIVEs;
    but the one line with $63 in looks clearer, so let's stick with that.
    
    Worried about what happens with an ALTERNATIVE between the jump and
    jump label in another ALTERNATIVE?  I was, but have checked the
    combinations in SWITCH_KERNEL_CR3_NO_STACK at entry_SYSCALL_64,
    and it does a good job.

    kaiser: add "nokaiser" boot option, using ALTERNATIVE
    
    
    Added "nokaiser" boot option: an early param like "noinvpcid".
    Most places now check int kaiser_enabled (#defined 0 when not
    CONFIG_KAISER) instead of #ifdef CONFIG_KAISER; but entry_64.S
    and entry_64_compat.S are using the ALTERNATIVE technique, which
    patches in the preferred instructions at runtime.  That technique
    is tied to x86 cpu features, so X86_FEATURE_KAISER is fabricated.
    
    Prior to "nokaiser", Kaiser #defined _PAGE_GLOBAL 0: revert that,
    but be careful with both _PAGE_GLOBAL and CR4.PGE: setting them when
    nokaiser like when !CONFIG_KAISER, but not setting either when kaiser -
    neither matters on its own, but it's hard to be sure that _PAGE_GLOBAL
    won't get set in some obscure corner, or something add PGE into CR4.
    By omitting _PAGE_GLOBAL from __supported_pte_mask when kaiser_enabled,
    all page table setup which uses pte_pfn() masks it out of the ptes.
    
    It's slightly shameful that the same declaration versus definition of
    kaiser_enabled appears in not one, not two, but in three header files
    (asm/kaiser.h, asm/pgtable.h, asm/tlbflush.h).  I felt safer that way,
    than with #including any of those in any of the others; and did not
    feel it worth an asm/kaiser_enabled.h - kernel/cpu/common.c includes
    them all, so we shall hear about it if they get out of synch.
    
    Cleanups while in the area: removed the silly #ifdef CONFIG_KAISER
    from kaiser.c; removed the unused native_get_normal_pgd(); removed
    the spurious reg clutter from SWITCH_*_CR3 macro stubs; corrected some
    comments.  But more interestingly, set CR4.PSE in secondary_startup_64:
    the manual is clear that it does not matter whether it's 0 or 1 when
    4-level-pts are enabled, but I was distracted to find cr4 different on
    BSP and auxiliaries - BSP alone was adding PSE, in probe_page_size_mask().

    kaiser: _pgd_alloc() without __GFP_REPEAT to avoid stalls
    
    
    Synthetic filesystem mempressure testing has shown softlockups, with
    hour-long page allocation stalls, and pgd_alloc() trying for order:1
    with __GFP_REPEAT in one of the backtraces each time.
    
    That's _pgd_alloc() going for a Kaiser double-pgd, using the __GFP_REPEAT
    common to all page table allocations, but actually having no effect on
    order:0 (see should_alloc_oom() and should_continue_reclaim() in this
    tree, but beware that ports to another tree might behave differently).
    
    Order:1 stack allocation has been working satisfactorily without
    __GFP_REPEAT forever, and page table allocation only asks __GFP_REPEAT
    for awkward occasions in a long-running process: it's not appropriate
    at fork or exec time, and seems to be doing much more harm than good:
    getting those contiguous pages under very heavy mempressure can be
    hard (though even without it, Kaiser does generate more mempressure).
    
    Mask out that __GFP_REPEAT inside _pgd_alloc().  Why not take it out
    of the PGALLOG_GFP altogether, as v4.7 commit a3a9a59d2067 ("x86: get
    rid of superfluous __GFP_REPEAT") did?  Because I think that might
    make a difference to our page table memcg charging, which I'd prefer
    not to interfere with at this time.
    
    hughd adds: __alloc_pages_slowpath() in the 4.4.89-stable tree handles
    __GFP_REPEAT a little differently than in prod kernel or 3.18.72-stable,
    so it may not always be exactly a no-op on order:0 pages, as said above;
    but I think still appropriate to omit it from Kaiser or non-Kaiser pgd.

    kaiser: paranoid_entry pass cr3 need to paranoid_exit
    
    
    Neel Natu points out that paranoid_entry() was wrong to assume that
    an entry that did not need swapgs would not need SWITCH_KERNEL_CR3:
    paranoid_entry (used for debug breakpoint, int3, double fault or MCE;
    though I think it's only the MCE case that is cause for concern here)
    can break in at an awkward time, between cr3 switch and swapgs, but
    its handling always needs kernel gs and kernel cr3.
    
    Easy to fix in itself, but paranoid_entry() also needs to convey to
    paranoid_exit() (and my reading of macro idtentry says paranoid_entry
    and paranoid_exit are always paired) how to restore the prior state.
    The swapgs state is already conveyed by %ebx (0 or 1), so extend that
    also to convey when SWITCH_USER_CR3 will be needed (2 or 3).
    
    (Yes, I'd much prefer that 0 meant no swapgs, whereas it's the other
    way round: and a convention shared with error_entry() and error_exit(),
    which I don't want to touch.  Perhaps I should have inverted the bit
    for switch cr3 too, but did not.)
    
    paranoid_exit() would be straightforward, except for TRACE_IRQS: it
    did TRACE_IRQS_IRETQ when doing swapgs, but TRACE_IRQS_IRETQ_DEBUG
    when not: which is it supposed to use when SWITCH_USER_CR3 is split
    apart from that?  As best as I can determine, commit 5963e317b1e9
    ("ftrace/x86: Do not change stacks in DEBUG when calling lockdep")
    missed the swapgs case, and should have used TRACE_IRQS_IRETQ_DEBUG
    there too (the discrepancy has nothing to do with the liberal use
    of _NO_STACK and _UNSAFE_STACK hereabouts: TRACE_IRQS_OFF_DEBUG has
    just been used in all cases); discrepancy lovingly preserved across
    several paranoid_exit() cleanups, but I'm now removing it.
    
    Neel further indicates that to use SWITCH_USER_CR3_NO_STACK there in
    paranoid_exit() is now not only unnecessary but unsafe: might corrupt
    syscall entry's unsafe_stack_register_backup of %rax.  Just use
    SWITCH_USER_CR3: and delete SWITCH_USER_CR3_NO_STACK altogether,
    before we make the mistake of using it again.
    
    hughd adds: this commit fixes an issue in the Kaiser-without-PCIDs
    part of the series, and ought to be moved earlier, if you decided
    to make a release of Kaiser-without-PCIDs.

    kaiser: x86_cr3_pcid_noflush and x86_cr3_pcid_user
    
    
    Mostly this commit is just unshouting X86_CR3_PCID_KERN_VAR and
    X86_CR3_PCID_USER_VAR: we usually name variables in lower-case.
    
    But why does x86_cr3_pcid_noflush need to be __aligned(PAGE_SIZE)?
    Ah, it's a leftover from when kaiser_add_user_map() once complained
    about mapping the same page twice.  Make it __read_mostly instead.
    (I'm a little uneasy about all the unrelated data which shares its
    page getting user-mapped too, but that was so before, and not a big
    deal: though we call it user-mapped, it's not mapped with _PAGE_USER.)
    
    And there is a little change around the two calls to do_nmi().
    Previously they set the NOFLUSH bit (if PCID supported) when
    forcing to kernel context before do_nmi(); now they also have the
    NOFLUSH bit set (if PCID supported) when restoring context after:
    nothing done in do_nmi() should require a TLB to be flushed here.

    kaiser: PCID 0 for kernel and 128 for user
    
    
    Why was 4 chosen for kernel PCID and 6 for user PCID?
    No good reason in a backport where PCIDs are only used for Kaiser.
    
    If we continue with those, then we shall need to add Andy Lutomirski's
    4.13 commit 6c690ee1039b ("x86/mm: Split read_cr3() into read_cr3_pa()
    and __read_cr3()"), which deals with the problem of read_cr3() callers
    finding stray bits in the cr3 that they expected to be page-aligned;
    and for hibernation, his 4.14 commit f34902c5c6c0 ("x86/hibernate/64:
    Mask off CR3's PCID bits in the saved CR3").
    
    But if 0 is used for kernel PCID, then there's no need to add in those
    commits - whenever the kernel looks, it sees 0 in the lower bits; and
    0 for kernel seems an obvious choice.
    
    And I naughtily propose 128 for user PCID.  Because there's a place
    in _SWITCH_TO_USER_CR3 where it takes note of the need for TLB FLUSH,
    but needs to reset that to NOFLUSH for the next occasion.  Currently
    it does so with a "movb $(0x80)" into the high byte of the per-cpu
    quadword, but that will cause a machine without PCID support to crash.
    Now, if %al just happened to have 0x80 in it at that point, on a
    machine with PCID support, but 0 on a machine without PCID support...
    
    (That will go badly wrong once the pgd can be at a physical address
    above 2^56, but even with 5-level paging, physical goes up to 2^52.)

    kaiser: load_new_mm_cr3() let SWITCH_USER_CR3 flush user
    
    
    We have many machines (Westmere, Sandybridge, Ivybridge) supporting
    PCID but not INVPCID: on these load_new_mm_cr3() simply crashed.
    
    Flushing user context inside load_new_mm_cr3() without the use of
    invpcid is difficult: momentarily switch from kernel to user context
    and back to do so?  I'm not sure whether that can be safely done at
    all, and would risk polluting user context with kernel internals,
    and kernel context with stale user externals.
    
    Instead, follow the hint in the comment that was there: change
    X86_CR3_PCID_USER_VAR to be a per-cpu variable, then load_new_mm_cr3()
    can leave a note in it, for SWITCH_USER_CR3 on return to userspace to
    flush user context TLB, instead of default X86_CR3_PCID_USER_NOFLUSH.
    
    Which works well enough that there's no need to do it this way only
    when invpcid is unsupported: it's a good alternative to invpcid here.
    But there's a couple of inlines in asm/tlbflush.h that need to do the
    same trick, so it's best to localize all this per-cpu business in
    mm/kaiser.c: moving that part of the initialization from setup_pcid()
    to kaiser_setup_pcid(); with kaiser_flush_tlb_on_return_to_user() the
    function for noting an X86_CR3_PCID_USER_FLUSH.  And let's keep a
    KAISER_SHADOW_PGD_OFFSET in there, to avoid the extra OR on exit.
    
    I did try to make the feature tests in asm/tlbflush.h more consistent
    with each other: there seem to be far too many ways of performing such
    tests, and I don't have a good grasp of their differences.  At first
    I converted them all to be static_cpu_has(): but that proved to be a
    mistake, as the comment in __native_flush_tlb_single() hints; so then
    I reversed and made them all this_cpu_has().  Probably all gratuitous
    change, but that's the way it's working at present.
    
    I am slightly bothered by the way non-per-cpu X86_CR3_PCID_KERN_VAR
    gets re-initialized by each cpu (before and after these changes):
    no problem when (as usual) all cpus on a machine have the same
    features, but in principle incorrect.  However, my experiment
    to per-cpu-ify that one did not end well...

    kaiser: vmstat show NR_KAISERTABLE as nr_overhead
    
    
    The kaiser update made an interesting choice, never to free any shadow
    page tables.  Contention on global spinlock was worrying, particularly
    with it held across page table scans when freeing.  Something had to be
    done: I was going to add refcounting; but simply never to free them is
    an appealing choice, minimizing contention without complicating the code
    (the more a page table is found already, the less the spinlock is used).
    
    But leaking pages in this way is also a worry: can we get away with it?
    At the very least, we need a count to show how bad it actually gets:
    in principle, one might end up wasting about 1/256 of memory that way
    (1/512 for when direct-mapped pages have to be user-mapped, plus 1/512
    for when they are user-mapped from the vmalloc area on another occasion
    (but we don't have vmalloc'ed stacks, so only large ldts are vmalloc'ed).
    
    Add per-cpu stat NR_KAISERTABLE: including 256 at startup for the
    shared pgd entries, and 1 for each intermediate page table added
    thereafter for user-mapping - but leave out the 1 per mm, for its
    shadow pgd, because that distracts from the monotonic increase.
    Shown in /proc/vmstat as nr_overhead (0 if kaiser not enabled).
    
    In practice, it doesn't look so bad so far: more like 1/12000 after
    nine hours of gtests below; and movable pageblock segregation should
    tend to cluster the kaiser tables into a subset of the address space
    (if not, they will be bad for compaction too).  But production may
    tell a different story: keep an eye on this number, and bring back
    lighter freeing if it gets out of control (maybe a shrinker).

    kaiser: delete KAISER_REAL_SWITCH option
    
    
    We fail to see what CONFIG_KAISER_REAL_SWITCH is for: it seems to be
    left over from early development, and now just obscures tricky parts
    of the code.  Delete it before adding PCIDs, or nokaiser boot option.
    
    (Or if there is some good reason to keep the option, then it needs
    a help text - and a "depends on KAISER", so that all those without
    KAISER are not asked the question.)

    kaiser: cleanups while trying for gold link
    
    
    While trying to get our gold link to work, four cleanups:
    matched the gdt_page declaration to its definition;
    in fiddling unsuccessfully with PERCPU_INPUT(), lined up backslashes;
    lined up the backslashes according to convention in percpu-defs.h;
    deleted the unused irq_stack_pointer addition to irq_stack_union.
    
    Sad to report that aligning backslashes does not appear to help gold
    align to 8192: but while these did not help, they are worth keeping.

    kaiser: kaiser_remove_mapping() move along the pgd
    
    
    When removing the bogus comment from kaiser_remove_mapping(),
    I really ought to have checked the extent of its bogosity: as
    Neel points out, there is nothing to stop unmap_pud_range_nofree()
    from continuing beyond the end of a pud (and starting in the wrong
    position on the next).
    
    Fix kaiser_remove_mapping() to constrain the extent and advance pgd
    pointer correctly: use pgd_addr_end() macro as used throughout base
    mm (but don't assume page-rounded start and size in this case).
    
    But this bug was very unlikely to trigger in this backport: since
    any buddy allocation is contained within a single pud extent, and
    we are not using vmapped stacks (and are only mapping one page of
    stack anyway): the only way to hit this bug here would be when
    freeing a large modified ldt.

    Yes, unmap_pud_range_nofree()'s declaration ought to be in a

    so for now just declare it inside kaiser_remove_mapping().

    even in a 5-level paging tree.

    kaiser: fix perf crashes
    
    
    Avoid perf crashes: place debug_store in the user-mapped per-cpu area
    instead of allocating, and use page allocator plus kaiser_add_mapping()
    to keep the BTS and PEBS buffers user-mapped (that is, present in the
    user mapping, though visible only to kernel and hardware).  The PEBS
    fixup buffer does not need this treatment.
    
    The need for a user-mapped struct debug_store showed up before doing
    any conscious perf testing: in a couple of kernel paging oopses on
    Westmere, implicating the debug_store offset of the per-cpu area.

    kaiser: fix regs to do_nmi() ifndef CONFIG_KAISER
    
    
    pjt has observed that nmi's second (nmi_from_kernel) call to do_nmi()
    adjusted the %rdi regs arg, rightly when CONFIG_KAISER, but wrongly
    when not CONFIG_KAISER.
    
    Although the minimal change is to add an #ifdef CONFIG_KAISER around
    the addq line, that looks cluttered, and I prefer how the first call
    to do_nmi() handled it: prepare args in %rdi and %rsi before getting
    into the CONFIG_KAISER block, since it does not touch them at all.
    
    And while we're here, place the "#ifdef CONFIG_KAISER" that follows
    each, to enclose the "Unconditionally restore CR3" comment: matching
    how the "Unconditionally use kernel CR3" comment above is enclosed.

    kaiser: KAISER depends on SMP
    
    
    It is absurd that KAISER should depend on SMP, but apparently nobody
    has tried a UP build before: which breaks on implicit declaration of
    function 'per_cpu_offset' in arch/x86/mm/kaiser.c.
    
    Now, you would expect that to be trivially fixed up; but looking at
    the System.map when that block is #ifdef'ed out of kaiser_init(),
    I see that in a UP build __per_cpu_user_mapped_end is precisely at
    __per_cpu_user_mapped_start, and the items carefully gathered into
    that section for user-mapping on SMP, dispersed elsewhere on UP.
    
    So, some other kind of section assignment will be needed on UP,
    but implementing that is not a priority: just make KAISER depend
    on SMP for now.
    
    Also inserted a blank line before the option, tidied up the
    brief Kconfig help message, and added an "If unsure, Y".

    Kaiser only needs to map one page of the stack; and

    kaiser_add_mapping() and kaiser_remove_mapping().  And use

    kaiser: do not set _PAGE_NX on pgd_none
    
    
    native_pgd_clear() uses native_set_pgd(), so native_set_pgd() must
    avoid setting the _PAGE_NX bit on an otherwise pgd_none() entry:
    usually that just generated a warning on exit, but sometimes
    more mysterious and damaging failures (our production machines
    could not complete booting).
    
    The original fix to this just avoided adding _PAGE_NX to
    an empty entry; but eventually more problems surfaced with kexec,
    and EFI mapping expected to be a problem too.  So now instead
    change native_set_pgd() to update shadow only if _PAGE_USER:
    
    A few places (kernel/machine_kexec_64.c, platform/efi/efi_64.c for sure)
    use set_pgd() to set up a temporary internal virtual address space, with
    physical pages remapped at what Kaiser regards as userspace addresses:
    Kaiser then assumes a shadow pgd follows, which it will try to corrupt.
    
    This appears to be responsible for the recent kexec and kdump failures;
    though it's unclear how those did not manifest as a problem before.
    Ah, the shadow pgd will only be assumed to "follow" if the requested
    pgd is on an even-numbered page: so I suppose it was going wrong 50%
    of the time all along.
    
    What we need is a flag to set_pgd(), to tell it we're dealing with
    userspace.  Er, isn't that what the pgd's _PAGE_USER bit is saying?
    Add a test for that.  But we cannot do the same for pgd_clear()
    (which may be called to clear corrupted entries - set aside the
    question of "corrupt in which pgd?" until later), so there just
    rely on pgd_clear() not being called in the problematic cases -
    with a WARN_ON_ONCE() which should fire half the time if it is.
    
    But this is getting too big for an inline function: move it into
    arch/x86/mm/kaiser.c (which then demands a boot/compressed mod);
    and de-void and de-space native_get_shadow/normal_pgd() while here.

    After several recent works [1,2,3] KASLR on x86_64 was basically
    considered dead by many researchers. We have been working on an
    efficient but effective fix for this problem and found that not mapping
    the kernel space when running in user mode is the solution to this
    problem [4] (the corresponding paper [5] will be presented at ESSoS17).
    
    With this RFC patch we allow anybody to configure their kernel with the
    flag CONFIG_KAISER to add our defense mechanism.
    
    If there are any questions we would love to answer them.
    We also appreciate any comments!
    
    Cheers,
