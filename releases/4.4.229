    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix invalid NULL check in snd_emuusb_set_samplerate()
    
    commit 6de3c9e3f6b3eaf66859e1379b3f35dda781416b upstream.
    
    The quirk function snd_emuusb_set_samplerate() has a NULL check for
    the mixer element, but this is useless in the current code.  It used
    to be a check against mixer->id_elems[unitid] but it was changed later
    to the value after mixer_eleme_list_to_info() which is always non-NULL
    due to the container_of() usage.
    
    This patch fixes the check before the conversion.
    
    While we're at it, correct a typo in the comment in the function,
    too.

    PCI: Disable MSI for HiSilicon Hip06/Hip07 only in Root Port mode
    
    commit deb86999323661c019ef2740eb9d479d1e526b5c upstream.
    
    HiSilicon Hip06/Hip07 can operate as either a Root Port or an Endpoint.  It
    always advertises an MSI capability, but it can only generate MSIs when in
    Endpoint mode.
    
    The device has the same Vendor and Device IDs in both modes, so check the
    Class Code and disable MSI only when operating as a Root Port.

    NFSv4 fix CLOSE not waiting for direct IO compeletion
    
    commit d03727b248d0dae6199569a8d7b629a681154633 upstream.
    
    Figuring out the root case for the REMOVE/CLOSE race and
    suggesting the solution was done by Neil Brown.
    
    Currently what happens is that direct IO calls hold a reference
    on the open context which is decremented as an asynchronous task
    in the nfs_direct_complete(). Before reference is decremented,
    control is returned to the application which is free to close the
    file. When close is being processed, it decrements its reference
    on the open_context but since directIO still holds one, it doesn't
    sent a close on the wire. It returns control to the application
    which is free to do other operations. For instance, it can delete a
    file. Direct IO is finally releasing its reference and triggering
    an asynchronous close. Which races with the REMOVE. On the server,
    REMOVE can be processed before the CLOSE, failing the REMOVE with
    EACCES as the file is still opened.

    SUNRPC: Properly set the @subbuf parameter of xdr_buf_subsegment()
    
    commit 89a3c9f5b9f0bcaa9aea3e8b2a616fcaea9aad78 upstream.
    
    @subbuf is an output parameter of xdr_buf_subsegment(). A survey of
    call sites shows that @subbuf is always uninitialized before
    xdr_buf_segment() is invoked by callers.
    
    There are some execution paths through xdr_buf_subsegment() that do
    not set all of the fields in @subbuf, leaving some pointer fields
    containing garbage addresses. Subsequent processing of that buffer
    then results in a page fault.

    tracing: Fix event trigger to accept redundant spaces
    
    commit 6784beada631800f2c5afd567e5628c843362cee upstream.
    
    Fix the event trigger to accept redundant spaces in
    the trigger input.
    
    For example, these return -EINVAL
    
    echo " traceon" > events/ftrace/print/trigger
    echo "traceon  if common_pid == 0" > events/ftrace/print/trigger
    echo "disable_event:kmem:kmalloc " > events/ftrace/print/trigger
    
    But these are hard to find what is wrong.
    
    To fix this issue, use skip_spaces() to remove spaces
    in front of actual tokens, and set NULL if there is no
    token.

    ocfs2: fix panic on nfs server over ocfs2
    
    commit e5a15e17a78d58f933d17cafedfcf7486a29f5b4 upstream.
    
    The following kernel panic was captured when running nfs server over
    ocfs2, at that time ocfs2_test_inode_bit() was checking whether one
    inode locating at "blkno" 5 was valid, that is ocfs2 root inode, its
    "suballoc_slot" was OCFS2_INVALID_SLOT(65535) and it was allocted from
    //global_inode_alloc, but here it wrongly assumed that it was got from per
    slot inode alloctor which would cause array overflow and trigger kernel
    panic.

    ocfs2: fix value of OCFS2_INVALID_SLOT
    
    commit 9277f8334ffc719fe922d776444d6e4e884dbf30 upstream.
    
    In the ocfs2 disk layout, slot number is 16 bits, but in ocfs2
    implementation, slot number is 32 bits.  Usually this will not cause any
    issue, because slot number is converted from u16 to u32, but
    OCFS2_INVALID_SLOT was defined as -1, when an invalid slot number from
    disk was obtained, its value was (u16)-1, and it was converted to u32.
    Then the following checking in get_local_system_inode will be always
    skipped:
    
     static struct inode **get_local_system_inode(struct ocfs2_super *osb,
                                                   int type,
                                                   u32 slot)
     {
            BUG_ON(slot == OCFS2_INVALID_SLOT);
            ...
     }

    mm/slab: use memzero_explicit() in kzfree()
    
    commit 8982ae527fbef170ef298650c15d55a9ccd33973 upstream.
    
    The kzfree() function is normally used to clear some sensitive
    information, like encryption keys, in the buffer before freeing it back to
    the pool.  Memset() is currently used for buffer clearing.  However
    unlikely, there is still a non-zero probability that the compiler may
    choose to optimize away the memory clearing especially if LTO is being
    used in the future.
    
    To make sure that this optimization will never happen,
    memzero_explicit(), which is introduced in v3.18, is now used in
    kzfree() to future-proof it.

    When /sys/firmware/acpi/pm_profile is read, sysfs_kf_seq_show is called,
    which in turn calls kobj_attr_show, which gets the ->show callback
    member by calling container_of on attr (casting it to struct
    kobj_attribute) then calls it.
    
    There is a CFI violation because pm_profile_attr is of type
    struct device_attribute but kobj_attr_show calls ->show expecting it
    to be from struct kobj_attribute. CFI checking ensures that function
    pointer types match when doing indirect calls. Fix pm_profile_attr to
    be defined in terms of kobj_attribute so there is no violation or
    mismatch.

    blktrace: break out of blktrace setup on concurrent calls
    
    [ Upstream commit 1b0b283648163dae2a214ca28ed5a99f62a77319 ]
    
    We use one blktrace per request_queue, that means one per the entire
    disk.  So we cannot run one blktrace on say /dev/vda and then /dev/vda1,
    or just two calls on /dev/vda.
    
    We check for concurrent setup only at the very end of the blktrace setup though.
    
    If we try to run two concurrent blktraces on the same block device the
    second one will fail, and the first one seems to go on. However when
    one tries to kill the first one one will see things like this:
    
    The kernel will show these:
    
    ```
    debugfs: File 'dropped' in directory 'nvme1n1' already present!
    debugfs: File 'msg' in directory 'nvme1n1' already present!
    debugfs: File 'trace0' in directory 'nvme1n1' already present!
    ``
    
    And userspace just sees this error message for the second call:
    
    ```
    blktrace /dev/nvme1n1
    BLKTRACESETUP(2) /dev/nvme1n1 failed: 5/Input/output error
    ```
    
    The first userspace process #1 will also claim that the files
    were taken underneath their nose as well. The files are taken
    away form the first process given that when the second blktrace
    fails, it will follow up with a BLKTRACESTOP and BLKTRACETEARDOWN.
    This means that even if go-happy process #1 is waiting for blktrace
    data, we *have* been asked to take teardown the blktrace.
    
    This can easily be reproduced with break-blktrace [0] run_0005.sh test.
    
    Just break out early if we know we're already going to fail, this will
    prevent trying to create the files all over again, which we know still
    exist.

    kbuild: improve cc-option to clean up all temporary files
    
    [ Upstream commit f2f02ebd8f3833626642688b2d2c6a7b3c141fa9 ]
    
    When cc-option and friends evaluate compiler flags, the temporary file
    $$TMP is created as an output object, and automatically cleaned up.
    The actual file path of $$TMP is .<pid>.tmp, here <pid> is the process
    ID of $(shell ...) invoked from cc-option. (Please note $$$$ is the
    escape sequence of $$).
    
    Such garbage files are cleaned up in most cases, but some compiler flags
    create additional output files.
    
    For example, -gsplit-dwarf creates a .dwo file.
    
    When CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_SPLIT=y, you will see a bunch of .<pid>.dwo files
    left in the top of build directories. You may not notice them unless you
    do 'ls -a', but the garbage files will increase every time you run 'make'.
    
    This commit changes the temporary object path to .tmp_<pid>/tmp, and
    removes .tmp_<pid> directory when exiting. Separate build artifacts such
    as *.dwo will be cleaned up all together because their file paths are
    usually determined based on the base name of the object.
    
    Another example is -ftest-coverage, which outputs the coverage data into
    <base-name-of-object>.gcno

    net: alx: fix race condition in alx_remove
    
    [ Upstream commit e89df5c4322c1bf495f62d74745895b5fd2a4393 ]
    
    There is a race condition exist during termination. The path is
    alx_stop and then alx_remove. An alx_schedule_link_check could be called
    before alx_stop by interrupt handler and invoke alx_link_check later.
    Alx_stop frees the napis, and alx_remove cancels any pending works.
    If any of the work is scheduled before termination and invoked before
    alx_remove, a null-ptr-deref occurs because both expect alx->napis[i].
    
    This patch fix the race condition by moving cancel_work_sync functions
    before alx_free_napis inside alx_stop. Because interrupt handler can call
    alx_schedule_link_check again, alx_free_irq is moved before
    cancel_work_sync calls too.

    sched/core: Fix PI boosting between RT and DEADLINE tasks
    
    [ Upstream commit 740797ce3a124b7dd22b7fb832d87bc8fba1cf6f ]
    
    syzbot reported the following warning:
    
     WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 6351 at kernel/sched/deadline.c:628
     enqueue_task_dl+0x22da/0x38a0 kernel/sched/deadline.c:1504
    
    At deadline.c:628 we have:
    
     623 static inline void setup_new_dl_entity(struct sched_dl_entity *dl_se)
     624 {
     625    struct dl_rq *dl_rq = dl_rq_of_se(dl_se);
     626    struct rq *rq = rq_of_dl_rq(dl_rq);
     627
     628    WARN_ON(dl_se->dl_boosted);
     629    WARN_ON(dl_time_before(rq_clock(rq), dl_se->deadline));
            [...]
         }
    
    Which means that setup_new_dl_entity() has been called on a task
    currently boosted. This shouldn't happen though, as setup_new_dl_entity()
    is only called when the 'dynamic' deadline of the new entity
    is in the past w.r.t. rq_clock and boosted tasks shouldn't verify this
    condition.
    
    Digging through the PI code I noticed that what above might in fact happen
    if an RT tasks blocks on an rt_mutex hold by a DEADLINE task. In the
    first branch of boosting conditions we check only if a pi_task 'dynamic'
    deadline is earlier than mutex holder's and in this case we set mutex
    holder to be dl_boosted. However, since RT 'dynamic' deadlines are only
    initialized if such tasks get boosted at some point (or if they become
    DEADLINE of course), in general RT 'dynamic' deadlines are usually equal
    to 0 and this verifies the aforementioned condition.
    
    Fix it by checking that the potential donor task is actually (even if
    temporary because in turn boosted) running at DEADLINE priority before
    using its 'dynamic' deadline value.

    netfilter: ipset: fix unaligned atomic access
    
    [ Upstream commit 715028460082d07a7ec6fcd87b14b46784346a72 ]
    
    When using ip_set with counters and comment, traffic causes the kernel
    to panic on 32-bit ARM:
    
    Alignment trap: not handling instruction e1b82f9f at [<bf01b0dc>]
    Unhandled fault: alignment exception (0x221) at 0xea08133c
    PC is at ip_set_match_extensions+0xe0/0x224 [ip_set]
    
    The problem occurs when we try to update the 64-bit counters - the
    faulting address above is not 64-bit aligned.  The problem occurs
    due to the way elements are allocated, for example:
    
            set->dsize = ip_set_elem_len(set, tb, 0, 0);
            map = ip_set_alloc(sizeof(*map) + elements * set->dsize);
    
    If the element has a requirement for a member to be 64-bit aligned,
    and set->dsize is not a multiple of 8, but is a multiple of four,
    then every odd numbered elements will be misaligned - and hitting
    an atomic64_add() on that element will cause the kernel to panic.
    
    ip_set_elem_len() must return a size that is rounded to the maximum
    alignment of any extension field stored in the element.  This change
    ensures that is the case.

    cifs/smb3: Fix data inconsistent when punch hole
    
    [ Upstream commit acc91c2d8de4ef46ed751c5f9df99ed9a109b100 ]
    
    When punch hole success, we also can read old data from file:
      # strace -e trace=pread64,fallocate xfs_io -f -c "pread 20 40" \
               -c "fpunch 20 40" -c"pread 20 40" file
      pread64(3, " version 5.8.0-rc1+"..., 40, 20) = 40
      fallocate(3, FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE|FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, 20, 40) = 0
      pread64(3, " version 5.8.0-rc1+"..., 40, 20) = 40
    
    CIFS implements the fallocate(FALLOCATE_FL_PUNCH_HOLE) with send SMB
    ioctl(FSCTL_SET_ZERO_DATA) to server. It just set the range of the
    remote file to zero, but local page caches not updated, then the
    local page caches inconsistent with server.
    
    Also can be found by xfstests generic/316.
    
    So, we need to remove the page caches before send the SMB
    ioctl(FSCTL_SET_ZERO_DATA) to server.

    xhci: Poll for U0 after disabling USB2 LPM
    
    [ Upstream commit b3d71abd135e6919ca0b6cab463738472653ddfb ]
    
    USB2 devices with LPM enabled may interrupt the system suspend:
    [  932.510475] usb 1-7: usb suspend, wakeup 0
    [  932.510549] hub 1-0:1.0: hub_suspend
    [  932.510581] usb usb1: bus suspend, wakeup 0
    [  932.510590] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: port 9 not suspended
    [  932.510593] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: port 8 not suspended
    ..
    [  932.520323] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: Port change event, 1-7, id 7, portsc: 0x400e03
    ..
    [  932.591405] PM: pci_pm_suspend(): hcd_pci_suspend+0x0/0x30 returns -16
    [  932.591414] PM: dpm_run_callback(): pci_pm_suspend+0x0/0x160 returns -16
    [  932.591418] PM: Device 0000:00:14.0 failed to suspend async: error -16
    
    During system suspend, USB core will let HC suspends the device if it
    doesn't have remote wakeup enabled and doesn't have any children.
    However, from the log above we can see that the usb 1-7 doesn't get bus
    suspended due to not in U0. After a while the port finished U2 -> U0
    transition, interrupts the suspend process.
    
    The observation is that after disabling LPM, port doesn't transit to U0
    immediately and can linger in U2. xHCI spec 4.23.5.2 states that the
    maximum exit latency for USB2 LPM should be BESL + 10us. The BESL for
    the affected device is advertised as 400us, which is still not enough
    based on my testing result.
    
    So let's use the maximum permitted latency, 10000, to poll for U0
    status to solve the issue.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix OOB access of mixer element list
    
    [ Upstream commit 220345e98f1cdc768eeb6e3364a0fa7ab9647fe7 ]
    
    The USB-audio mixer code holds a linked list of usb_mixer_elem_list,
    and several operations are performed for each mixer element.  A few of
    them (snd_usb_mixer_notify_id() and snd_usb_mixer_interrupt_v2())
    assume each mixer element being a usb_mixer_elem_info object that is a
    subclass of usb_mixer_elem_list, cast via container_of() and access it
    members.  This may result in an out-of-bound access when a
    non-standard list element has been added, as spotted by syzkaller
    recently.
    
    This patch adds a new field, is_std_info, in usb_mixer_elem_list to
    indicate that the element is the usb_mixer_elem_info type or not, and
    skip the access to such an element if needed.

    [ Upstream commit 191227d99a281333b50aaf82ab4152fbfa249c19 ]
    
    miniDSP USBStreamer UAC2 devices send clock validity changes with the
    control field set to zero. The current interrupt handler ignores all
    packets if the control field does not match the mixer element's, but
    it really should only do that in case that field is needed to
    distinguish multiple elements with the same ID.
    
    This patch implements a logic that lets notifications packets pass
    if the element ID is unique for a given device.

    xhci: Fix enumeration issue when setting max packet size for FS devices.
    
    commit a73d9d9cfc3cfceabd91fb0b0c13e4062b6dbcd7 upstream.
    
    Unable to complete the enumeration of a USB TV Tuner device.
    
    Per XHCI spec (4.6.5), the EP state field of the input context shall
    be cleared for a set address command. In the special case of an FS
    device that has "MaxPacketSize0 = 8", the Linux XHCI driver does
    not do this before evaluating the context. With an XHCI controller
    that checks the EP state field for parameter context error this
    causes a problem in cases such as the device getting reset again
    after enumeration.
    
    When that field is cleared, the problem does not occur.
    
    This was found and fixed by Sasi Kumar.

    USB: ehci: reopen solution for Synopsys HC bug
    
    commit 1ddcb71a3edf0e1682b6e056158e4c4b00325f66 upstream.
    
    A Synopsys USB2.0 core used in Huawei Kunpeng920 SoC has a bug which
    might cause the host controller not issuing ping.
    
    Bug description:
    After indicating an Interrupt on Async Advance, the software uses the
    doorbell mechanism to delete the Next Link queue head of the last
    executed queue head. At this time, the host controller still references
    the removed queue head(the queue head is NULL). NULL reference causes
    the host controller to lose the USB device.
    
    Solution:
    After deleting the Next Link queue head, when has_synopsys_hc_bug set
    to 1，the software can write one of the valid queue head addresses to
    the ASYNCLISTADDR register to allow the host controller to get
    the valid queue head. in order to solve that problem, this patch set
    the flag for Huawei Kunpeng920
    
    There are detailed instructions and solutions in this patch:

    net: core: reduce recursion limit value
    
    [ Upstream commit fb7861d14c8d7edac65b2fcb6e8031cb138457b2 ]
    
    In the current code, ->ndo_start_xmit() can be executed recursively only
    10 times because of stack memory.
    But, in the case of the vxlan, 10 recursion limit value results in
    a stack overflow.
    In the current code, the nested interface is limited by 8 depth.
    There is no critical reason that the recursion limitation value should
    be 10.
    So, it would be good to be the same value with the limitation value of
    nesting interface depth.
    
    Test commands:
        ip link add vxlan10 type vxlan vni 10 dstport 4789 srcport 4789 4789
        ip link set vxlan10 up
        ip a a 192.168.10.1/24 dev vxlan10
        ip n a 192.168.10.2 dev vxlan10 lladdr fc:22:33:44:55:66 nud permanent
    
        for i in {9..0}
        do
            let A=$i+1
            ip link add vxlan$i type vxlan vni $i dstport 4789 srcport 4789 4789
            ip link set vxlan$i up
            ip a a 192.168.$i.1/24 dev vxlan$i
            ip n a 192.168.$i.2 dev vxlan$i lladdr fc:22:33:44:55:66 nud permanent
            bridge fdb add fc:22:33:44:55:66 dev vxlan$A dst 192.168.$i.2 self

    net: Do not clear the sock TX queue in sk_set_socket()
    
    [ Upstream commit 41b14fb8724d5a4b382a63cb4a1a61880347ccb8 ]
    
    Clearing the sock TX queue in sk_set_socket() might cause unexpected
    out-of-order transmit when called from sock_orphan(), as outstanding
    packets can pick a different TX queue and bypass the ones already queued.
    
    This is undesired in general. More specifically, it breaks the in-order
    scheduling property guarantee for device-offloaded TLS sockets.
    
    Remove the call to sk_tx_queue_clear() in sk_set_socket(), and add it
    explicitly only where needed.

    sctp: Don't advertise IPv4 addresses if ipv6only is set on the socket
    
    [ Upstream commit 471e39df96b9a4c4ba88a2da9e25a126624d7a9c ]
    
    If a socket is set ipv6only, it will still send IPv4 addresses in the
    INIT and INIT_ACK packets. This potentially misleads the peer into using
    them, which then would cause association termination.
    
    The fix is to not add IPv4 addresses to ipv6only sockets.

    tcp: grow window for OOO packets only for SACK flows
    
    [ Upstream commit 662051215c758ae8545451628816204ed6cd372d ]
    
    Back in 2013, we made a change that broke fast retransmit
    for non SACK flows.
    
    Indeed, for these flows, a sender needs to receive three duplicate
    ACK before starting fast retransmit. Sending ACK with different
    receive window do not count.
    
    Even if enabling SACK is strongly recommended these days,
    there still are some cases where it has to be disabled.
    
    Not increasing the window seems better than having to
    rely on RTO.
    
    After the fix, following packetdrill test gives :
    
    // Initialize connection
        0 socket(..., SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) = 3
       +0 setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0

    ip6_gre: fix use-after-free in ip6gre_tunnel_lookup()
    
    [ Upstream commit dafabb6590cb15f300b77c095d50312e2c7c8e0f ]
    
    In the datapath, the ip6gre_tunnel_lookup() is used and it internally uses
    fallback tunnel device pointer, which is fb_tunnel_dev.
    This pointer variable should be set to NULL when a fb interface is deleted.
    But there is no routine to set fb_tunnel_dev pointer to NULL.
    So, this pointer will be still used after interface is deleted and
    it eventually results in the use-after-free problem.
    
    Test commands:
        ip netns add A
        ip netns add B
        ip link add eth0 type veth peer name eth1
        ip link set eth0 netns A
        ip link set eth1 netns B
    
        ip netns exec A ip link set lo up
        ip netns exec A ip link set eth0 up
        ip netns exec A ip link add ip6gre1 type ip6gre local fc:0::1 \
                remote fc:0::2
        ip netns exec A ip -6 a a fc:100::1/64 dev ip6gre1
        ip netns exec A ip link set ip6gre1 up
        ip netns exec A ip -6 a a fc:0::1/64 dev eth0
        ip netns exec A ip link set ip6gre0 up
    
        ip netns exec B ip link set lo up
        ip netns exec B ip link set eth1 up
        ip netns exec B ip link add ip6gre1 type ip6gre local fc:0::2 \
                remote fc:0::1
        ip netns exec B ip -6 a a fc:100::2/64 dev ip6gre1
        ip netns exec B ip link set ip6gre1 up
        ip netns exec B ip -6 a a fc:0::2/64 dev eth1
        ip netns exec B ip link set ip6gre0 up
        ip netns exec A ping fc:100::2 -s 60000 &

    [ Upstream commit b344579ca8478598937215f7005d6c7b84d28aee ]
    
    Mirja Kuehlewind reported a bug in Linux TCP CUBIC Hystart, where
    Hystart HYSTART_DELAY mechanism can exit Slow Start spuriously on an
    ACK when the minimum rtt of a connection goes down. From inspection it
    is clear from the existing code that this could happen in an example
    like the following:
    
    o The first 8 RTT samples in a round trip are 150ms, resulting in a
      curr_rtt of 150ms and a delay_min of 150ms.
    
    o The 9th RTT sample is 100ms. The curr_rtt does not change after the
      first 8 samples, so curr_rtt remains 150ms. But delay_min can be
      lowered at any time, so delay_min falls to 100ms. The code executes
      the HYSTART_DELAY comparison between curr_rtt of 150ms and delay_min
      of 100ms, and the curr_rtt is declared far enough above delay_min to
      force a (spurious) exit of Slow start.
    
    The fix here is simple: allow every RTT sample in a round trip to
    lower the curr_rtt.

    ip_tunnel: fix use-after-free in ip_tunnel_lookup()
    
    [ Upstream commit ba61539c6ae57f4146284a5cb4f7b7ed8d42bf45 ]
    
    In the datapath, the ip_tunnel_lookup() is used and it internally uses
    fallback tunnel device pointer, which is fb_tunnel_dev.
    This pointer variable should be set to NULL when a fb interface is deleted.
    But there is no routine to set fb_tunnel_dev pointer to NULL.
    So, this pointer will be still used after interface is deleted and
    it eventually results in the use-after-free problem.
    
    Test commands:
        ip netns add A
        ip netns add B
        ip link add eth0 type veth peer name eth1
        ip link set eth0 netns A
        ip link set eth1 netns B
    
        ip netns exec A ip link set lo up
        ip netns exec A ip link set eth0 up
        ip netns exec A ip link add gre1 type gre local 10.0.0.1 \
                remote 10.0.0.2
        ip netns exec A ip link set gre1 up
        ip netns exec A ip a a 10.0.100.1/24 dev gre1
        ip netns exec A ip a a 10.0.0.1/24 dev eth0
    
        ip netns exec B ip link set lo up
        ip netns exec B ip link set eth1 up
        ip netns exec B ip link add gre1 type gre local 10.0.0.2 \
                remote 10.0.0.1
        ip netns exec B ip link set gre1 up
        ip netns exec B ip a a 10.0.100.2/24 dev gre1
        ip netns exec B ip a a 10.0.0.2/24 dev eth1

    The driver function tg3_io_error_detected() calls napi_disable twice,
    without an intervening napi_enable, when the number of EEH errors exceeds
    eeh_max_freezes, resulting in an indefinite sleep while holding rtnl_lock.

    net: usb: ax88179_178a: fix packet alignment padding
    
    [ Upstream commit e869e7a17798d85829fa7d4f9bbe1eebd4b2d3f6 ]
    
    Using a AX88179 device (0b95:1790), I see two bytes of appended data on
    every RX packet. For example, this 48-byte ping, using 0xff as a
    payload byte:
    
      04:20:22.528472 IP 192.168.1.1 > 192.168.1.2: ICMP echo request, id 2447, seq 1, length 64
            0x0000:  000a cd35 ea50 000a cd35 ea4f 0800 4500
            0x0010:  0054 c116 4000 4001 f63e c0a8 0101 c0a8
            0x0020:  0102 0800 b633 098f 0001 87ea cd5e 0000
            0x0030:  0000 dcf2 0600 0000 0000 ffff ffff ffff
            0x0040:  ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff
            0x0050:  ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff
            0x0060:  ffff 961f
    
    Those last two bytes - 96 1f - aren't part of the original packet.
    
    In the ax88179 RX path, the usbnet rx_fixup function trims a 2-byte
    'alignment pseudo header' from the start of the packet, and sets the
    length from a per-packet field populated by hardware. It looks like that
    length field *includes* the 2-byte header; the current driver assumes
    that it's excluded.
    
    This change trims the 2-byte alignment header after we've set the packet
    length, so the resulting packet length is correct. While we're moving
    the comment around, this also fixes the spelling of 'pseudo'.

    l2tp: Allow duplicate session creation with UDP
    
    commit 0d0d9a388a858e271bb70e71e99e7fe2a6fd6f64 upstream.
    
    In the past it was possible to create multiple L2TPv3 sessions with the
    same session id as long as the sessions belonged to different tunnels.
    The resulting sessions had issues when used with IP encapsulated tunnels,
    but worked fine with UDP encapsulated ones. Some applications began to
    rely on this behaviour to avoid having to negotiate unique session ids.
    
    Some time ago a change was made to require session ids to be unique across
    all tunnels, breaking the applications making use of this "feature".
    
    This change relaxes the duplicate session id check to allow duplicates
    if both of the colliding sessions belong to UDP encapsulated tunnels.

    Commit 5dbe7c178d3f ("net: fix kernel deadlock with interface rename and
    netdev name retrieval.") handled a deadlock, observed with
    CONFIG_PREEMPTION=n, where the devnet_rename seqcount read side was
    infinitely spinning: it got scheduled after the seqcount write side
    blocked inside its own critical section.
    
    To fix that deadlock, among other issues, the commit added a
    cond_resched() inside the read side section. While this will get the
    non-preemptible kernel eventually unstuck, the seqcount reader is fully
    exhausting its slice just spinning -- until TIF_NEED_RESCHED is set.
    
    The fix is also still broken: if the seqcount reader belongs to a
    real-time scheduling policy, it can spin forever and the kernel will
    livelock.
    
    Disabling preemption over the seqcount write side critical section will
    not work: inside it are a number of GFP_KERNEL allocations and mutex
    locking through the drivers/base/ :: device_rename() call chain.
    
    >From all the above, replace the seqcount with a rwsem.

    The code within the kretprobe handler checks for probe reentrancy,
    so we won't trigger any _raw_spin_lock_irqsave probe in there.
    
    The problem is in outside kprobe_flush_task, where we call:
    
      kprobe_flush_task
        kretprobe_table_lock
          raw_spin_lock_irqsave
            _raw_spin_lock_irqsave
    
    where _raw_spin_lock_irqsave triggers the kretprobe and installs
    kretprobe_trampoline handler on _raw_spin_lock_irqsave return.
    
    The kretprobe_trampoline handler is then executed with already
    locked kretprobe_table_locks, and first thing it does is to
    lock kretprobe_table_locks ;-) the whole lockup path like:
    
      kprobe_flush_task
        kretprobe_table_lock
          raw_spin_lock_irqsave
            _raw_spin_lock_irqsave ---> probe triggered, kretprobe_trampoline installed
    
            ---> kretprobe_table_locks locked
    
            kretprobe_trampoline
              trampoline_handler
                kretprobe_hash_lock(current, &head, &flags);  <--- deadlock
    
    Adding kprobe_busy_begin/end helpers that mark code with fake
    probe installed to prevent triggering of another kprobe within
    this code.
    
    Using these helpers in kprobe_flush_task, so the probe recursion
    protection check is hit and the probe is never set to prevent
    above lockup.

    x86/kprobes: Avoid kretprobe recursion bug
    
    [ Upstream commit b191fa96ea6dc00d331dcc28c1f7db5e075693a0 ]
    
    Avoid kretprobe recursion loop bg by setting a dummy
    kprobes to current_kprobe per-CPU variable.
    
    This bug has been introduced with the asm-coded trampoline
    code, since previously it used another kprobe for hooking
    the function return placeholder (which only has a nop) and
    trampoline handler was called from that kprobe.
    
    This revives the old lost kprobe again.
    
    With this fix, we don't see deadlock anymore.
    
    And you can see that all inner-called kretprobe are skipped.
    
      event_1                                  235               0
      event_2                                19375           19612
    
    The 1st column is recorded count and the 2nd is missed count.
    Above shows (event_1 rec) + (event_2 rec) ~= (event_2 missed)
    (some difference are here because the counter is racy)

        linux/module.h through other headers, and
      - two, with a missing const qualifier for a local variable which ends
        up referring a string literal. Again, this is unique to how

    crypto: algboss - don't wait during notifier callback
    
    commit 77251e41f89a813b4090f5199442f217bbf11297 upstream.
    
    When a crypto template needs to be instantiated, CRYPTO_MSG_ALG_REQUEST
    is sent to crypto_chain.  cryptomgr_schedule_probe() handles this by
    starting a thread to instantiate the template, then waiting for this
    thread to complete via crypto_larval::completion.
    
    This can deadlock because instantiating the template may require loading
    modules, and this (apparently depending on userspace) may need to wait
    for the crc-t10dif module (lib/crc-t10dif.c) to be loaded.  But
    crc-t10dif's module_init function uses crypto_register_notifier() and
    therefore takes crypto_chain.rwsem for write.  That can't proceed until
    the notifier callback has finished, as it holds this semaphore for read.
    
    Fix this by removing the wait on crypto_larval::completion from within
    cryptomgr_schedule_probe().  It's actually unnecessary because
    crypto_alg_mod_lookup() calls crypto_larval_wait() itself after sending
    CRYPTO_MSG_ALG_REQUEST.
    
    This only actually became a problem in v4.20 due to commit b76377543b73
    ("crc-t10dif: Pick better transform if one becomes available"), but the
    unnecessary wait was much older.

    Disable preemption before entering that sequence counter's write side

    section and spin for the entire scheduler tick. If the reader belongs to
    a real-time scheduling class, it can spin forever and the kernel will
    livelock.

    drm/dp_mst: Increase ACT retry timeout to 3s
    
    [ Upstream commit 873a95e0d59ac06901ae261dda0b7165ffd002b8 ]
    
    Currently we only poll for an ACT up to 30 times, with a busy-wait delay
    of 100µs between each attempt - giving us a timeout of 2900µs. While
    this might seem sensible, it would appear that in certain scenarios it
    can take dramatically longer then that for us to receive an ACT. On one
    of the EVGA MST hubs that I have available, I observed said hub
    sometimes taking longer then a second before signalling the ACT. These
    delays mostly seem to occur when previous sideband messages we've sent
    are NAKd by the hub, however it wouldn't be particularly surprising if
    it's possible to reproduce times like this simply by introducing branch
    devices with large LCTs since payload allocations have to take effect on
    every downstream device up to the payload's target.
    
    So, instead of just retrying 30 times we poll for the ACT for up to 3ms,
    and additionally use usleep_range() to avoid a very long and rude
    busy-wait. Note that the previous retry count of 30 appears to have been
    arbitrarily chosen, as I can't find any mention of a recommended timeout
    or retry count for ACTs in the DisplayPort 2.0 specification. This also
    goes for the range we were previously using for udelay(), although I
    suspect that was just copied from the recommended delay for link
    training on SST devices.
    
    Changes since v1:
    * Use readx_poll_timeout() instead of open-coding timeout loop - Sean
      Paul
    Changes since v2:
    * Increase poll interval to 200us - Sean Paul
    * Print status in hex when we timeout waiting for ACT - Sean Paul

    ext4: fix partial cluster initialization when splitting extent
    
    [ Upstream commit cfb3c85a600c6aa25a2581b3c1c4db3460f14e46 ]
    
    Fix the bug when calculating the physical block number of the first
    block in the split extent.
    
    This bug will cause xfstests shared/298 failure on ext4 with bigalloc
    enabled occasionally. Ext4 error messages indicate that previously freed
    blocks are being freed again, and the following fsck will fail due to
    the inconsistency of block bitmap and bg descriptor.
    
    The following is an example case:
    
    1. First, Initialize a ext4 filesystem with cluster size '16K', block size
    '4K', in which case, one cluster contains four blocks.
    
    2. Create one file (e.g., xxx.img) on this ext4 filesystem. Now the extent
    tree of this file is like:
    
    ...
    36864:[0]4:220160
    36868:[0]14332:145408
    51200:[0]2:231424
    ...
    
    3. Then execute PUNCH_HOLE fallocate on this file. The hole range is
    like:
    
    ..
    ext4_ext_remove_space: dev 254,16 ino 12 since 49506 end 49506 depth 1
    ext4_ext_remove_space: dev 254,16 ino 12 since 49544 end 49546 depth 1
    ext4_ext_remove_space: dev 254,16 ino 12 since 49605 end 49607 depth 1
    ...
    
    4. Then the extent tree of this file after punching is like
    
    ...
    49507:[0]37:158047
    49547:[0]58:158087
    ...
    
    5. Detailed procedure of punching hole [49544, 49546]
    
    5.1. The block address space:
    ```
    lblk        ~49505  49506   49507~49543     49544~49546    49547~
              ---------+------+-------------+----------------+--------
                extent | hole |   extent    |       hole     | extent
              ---------+------+-------------+----------------+--------
    pblk       ~158045  158046  158047~158083  158084~158086   158087~
    ```
    
    5.2. The detailed layout of cluster 39521:
    ```
                    cluster 39521
            <------------------------------->
    
                    hole              extent
            <----------------------><--------
    
    lblk      49544   49545   49546   49547
            +-------+-------+-------+-------+
            |       |       |       |       |
            +-------+-------+-------+-------+
    pblk     158084  1580845  158086  158087
    ```
    
    5.3. The ftrace output when punching hole [49544, 49546]:
    - ext4_ext_remove_space (start 49544, end 49546)
      - ext4_ext_rm_leaf (start 49544, end 49546, last_extent [49507(158047), 40], partial [pclu 39522 lblk 0 state 2])
        - ext4_remove_blocks (extent [49507(158047), 40], from 49544 to 49546, partial [pclu 39522 lblk 0 state 2]
          - ext4_free_blocks: (block 158084 count 4)
            - ext4_mballoc_free (extent 1/6753/1)
    
    5.4. Ext4 error message in dmesg:
    EXT4-fs error (device vdb): mb_free_blocks:1457: group 1, block 158084:freeing already freed block (bit 6753); block bitmap corrupt.
    EXT4-fs error (device vdb): ext4_mb_generate_buddy:747: group 1, block bitmap and bg descriptor inconsistent: 19550 vs 19551 free clusters
    
    In this case, the whole cluster 39521 is freed mistakenly when freeing
    pblock 158084~158086 (i.e., the first three blocks of this cluster),
    although pblock 158087 (the last remaining block of this cluster) has
    not been freed yet.
    
    The root cause of this isuue is that, the pclu of the partial cluster is
    calculated mistakenly in ext4_ext_remove_space(). The correct
    partial_cluster.pclu (i.e., the cluster number of the first block in the
    next extent, that is, lblock 49597 (pblock 158086)) should be 39521 rather
    than 39522.

    selinux: fix double free
    
    commit 65de50969a77509452ae590e9449b70a22b923bb upstream.
    
    Clang's static analysis tool reports these double free memory errors.
    
    security/selinux/ss/services.c:2987:4: warning: Attempt to free released memory [unix.Malloc]
                            kfree(bnames[i]);

            kfree(bvalues);
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    So improve the security_get_bools error handling by freeing these variables
    and setting their return pointers to NULL and the return len to 0

    drm/qxl: Use correct notify port address when creating cursor ring
    
    commit 80e5f89da3ab949fbbf1cae01dfaea29f5483a75 upstream.
    
    The command ring and cursor ring use different notify port addresses
    definition: QXL_IO_NOTIFY_CMD and QXL_IO_NOTIFY_CURSOR. However, in
    qxl_device_init() we use QXL_IO_NOTIFY_CMD to create both command ring
    and cursor ring. This doesn't cause any problems now, because QEMU's
    behaviors on QXL_IO_NOTIFY_CMD and QXL_IO_NOTIFY_CURSOR are the same.
    However, QEMU's behavior may be change in future, so let's fix it.
    
    P.S.: In the X.org QXL driver, the notify port address of cursor ring
          is correct.

    libata: Use per port sync for detach
    
    [ Upstream commit b5292111de9bb70cba3489075970889765302136 ]
    
    Commit 130f4caf145c ("libata: Ensure ata_port probe has completed before
    detach") may cause system freeze during suspend.
    
    Using async_synchronize_full() in PM callbacks is wrong, since async
    callbacks that are already scheduled may wait for not-yet-scheduled
    callbacks, causes a circular dependency.
    
    Instead of using big hammer like async_synchronize_full(), use async
    cookie to make sure port probe are synced, without affecting other
    scheduled PM callbacks.

    block: Fix use-after-free in blkdev_get()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d3a8e2deddea6c89961c422ec0c5b851e648c14 ]
    
    In blkdev_get() we call __blkdev_get() to do some internal jobs and if
    there is some errors in __blkdev_get(), the bdput() is called which
    means we have released the refcount of the bdev (actually the refcount of
    the bdev inode). This means we cannot access bdev after that point. But
    acctually bdev is still accessed in blkdev_get() after calling
    __blkdev_get(). This results in use-after-free if the refcount is the
    last one we released in __blkdev_get(). Let's take a look at the
    following scenerio:
    
      CPU0            CPU1                    CPU2
    blkdev_open     blkdev_open           Remove disk
                      bd_acquire
                      blkdev_get
                        __blkdev_get      del_gendisk
                                            bdev_unhash_inode
      bd_acquire          bdev_get_gendisk
        bd_forget           failed because of unhashed
              bdput
                          bdput (the last one)
                            bdev_evict_inode
    
                        access bdev => use after free

    bcache: fix potential deadlock problem in btree_gc_coalesce
    
    [ Upstream commit be23e837333a914df3f24bf0b32e87b0331ab8d1 ]
    
    coccicheck reports:
      drivers/md//bcache/btree.c:1538:1-7: preceding lock on line 1417
    
    In btree_gc_coalesce func, if the coalescing process fails, we will goto
    to out_nocoalesce tag directly without releasing new_nodes[i]->write_lock.
    Then, it will cause a deadlock when trying to acquire new_nodes[i]->
    write_lock for freeing new_nodes[i] before return.
    
    btree_gc_coalesce func details as follows:
            if alloc new_nodes[i] fails:
                    goto out_nocoalesce;
            // obtain new_nodes[i]->write_lock
            mutex_lock(&new_nodes[i]->write_lock)
            // main coalescing process
            for (i = nodes - 1; i > 0; --i)
                    [snipped]
                    if coalescing process fails:
                            // Here, directly goto out_nocoalesce
                             // tag will cause a deadlock
                            goto out_nocoalesce;
                    [snipped]
            // release new_nodes[i]->write_lock
            mutex_unlock(&new_nodes[i]->write_lock)
            // coalesing succ, return
            return;
    out_nocoalesce:
            btree_node_free(new_nodes[i])   // free new_nodes[i]
            // obtain new_nodes[i]->write_lock
            mutex_lock(&new_nodes[i]->write_lock);
            // set flag for reuse
            clear_bit(BTREE_NODE_dirty, &ew_nodes[i]->flags);
            // release new_nodes[i]->write_lock
            mutex_unlock(&new_nodes[i]->write_lock);
    
    To fix the problem, we add a new tag 'out_unlock_nocoalesce' for
    releasing new_nodes[i]->write_lock before out_nocoalesce tag. If
    coalescing process fails, we will go to out_unlock_nocoalesce tag
    for releasing new_nodes[i]->write_lock before free new_nodes[i] in
    out_nocoalesce tag.

    elfnote: mark all .note sections SHF_ALLOC
    
    [ Upstream commit 51da9dfb7f20911ae4e79e9b412a9c2d4c373d4b ]
    
    ELFNOTE_START allows callers to specify flags for .pushsection assembler
    directives.  All callsites but ELF_NOTE use "a" for SHF_ALLOC.  For vdso's
    that explicitly use ELF_NOTE_START and BUILD_SALT, the same section is
    specified twice after preprocessing, once with "a" flag, once without.
    Example:
    
    .pushsection .note.Linux, "a", @note ;
    .pushsection .note.Linux, "", @note ;
    
    While GNU as allows this ordering, it warns for the opposite ordering,
    making these directives position dependent.  We'd prefer not to precisely
    match this behavior in Clang's integrated assembler.  Instead, the non
    __ASSEMBLY__ definition of ELF_NOTE uses
    __attribute__((section(".note.Linux"))) which is created with SHF_ALLOC,
    so let's make the __ASSEMBLY__ definition of ELF_NOTE consistent with C
    and just always use "a" flag.
    
    This allows Clang to assemble a working mainline (5.6) kernel via:
    $ make CC=clang AS=clang

    lib/zlib: remove outdated and incorrect pre-increment optimization
    
    [ Upstream commit acaab7335bd6f0c0b54ce3a00bd7f18222ce0f5f ]
    
    The zlib inflate code has an old micro-optimization based on the
    assumption that for pre-increment memory accesses, the compiler will
    generate code that fits better into the processor's pipeline than what
    would be generated for post-increment memory accesses.
    
    This optimization was already removed in upstream zlib in 2016:
    https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/9aaec95e8211
    
    This optimization causes UB according to C99, which says in section 6.5.6
    "Additive operators": "If both the pointer operand and the result point to
    elements of the same array object, or one past the last element of the
    array object, the evaluation shall not produce an overflow; otherwise, the
    behavior is undefined".
    
    This UB is not only a theoretical concern, but can also cause trouble for
    future work on compiler-based sanitizers.
    
    According to the zlib commit, this optimization also is not optimal
    anymore with modern compilers.
    
    Replace uses of OFF, PUP and UP_UNALIGNED with their definitions in the
    POSTINC case, and remove the macro definitions, just like in the upstream
    patch.

    gfs2: Allow lock_nolock mount to specify jid=X
    
    [ Upstream commit ea22eee4e6027d8927099de344f7fff43c507ef9 ]
    
    Before this patch, a simple typo accidentally added \n to the jid=
    string for lock_nolock mounts. This made it impossible to mount a
    gfs2 file system with a journal other than journal0. Thus:
    
    mount -tgfs2 -o hostdata="jid=1" <device> <mount pt>
    
    Resulted in:
    mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on <device>
    
    In most cases this is not a problem. However, for debugging and
    testing purposes we sometimes want to test the integrity of other
    journals. This patch removes the unnecessary \n and thus allows
    lock_nolock users to specify an alternate journal.

    openrisc: Fix issue with argument clobbering for clone/fork
    
    [ Upstream commit 6bd140e14d9aaa734ec37985b8b20a96c0ece948 ]
    
    Working on the OpenRISC glibc port I found that sometimes clone was
    working strange.  That the tls data argument sent in r7 was always
    wrong.  Further investigation revealed that the arguments were getting
    clobbered in the entry code.  This patch removes the code that writes to
    the argument registers.  This was likely due to some old code hanging
    around.
    
    This patch fixes this up for clone and fork.  This fork clobber is
    harmless but also useless so remove.

    ASoC: fsl_asrc_dma: Fix dma_chan leak when config DMA channel failed
    
    [ Upstream commit 36124fb19f1ae68a500cd76a76d40c6e81bee346 ]
    
    fsl_asrc_dma_hw_params() invokes dma_request_channel() or
    fsl_asrc_get_dma_channel(), which returns a reference of the specified
    dma_chan object to "pair->dma_chan[dir]" with increased refcnt.
    
    The reference counting issue happens in one exception handling path of
    fsl_asrc_dma_hw_params(). When config DMA channel failed for Back-End,
    the function forgets to decrease the refcnt increased by
    dma_request_channel() or fsl_asrc_get_dma_channel(), causing a refcnt
    leak.
    
    Fix this issue by calling dma_release_channel() when config DMA channel
    failed.

    net: sunrpc: Fix off-by-one issues in 'rpc_ntop6'
    
    [ Upstream commit 118917d696dc59fd3e1741012c2f9db2294bed6f ]
    
    Fix off-by-one issues in 'rpc_ntop6':
     - 'snprintf' returns the number of characters which would have been
       written if enough space had been available, excluding the terminating
       null byte. Thus, a return value of 'sizeof(scopebuf)' means that the
       last character was dropped.
     - 'strcat' adds a terminating null byte to the string, thus if len ==
       buflen, the null byte is written past the end of the buffer.

    It is not wrong, queue is not a pointer so if ep is not NULL, the
    address of queue cannot be NULL. No other driver does a check like this
    and this check has been around since the driver was first introduced,
    presumably with no issues so it does not seem like this check should be
    something else. Just remove it.

    usb: dwc2: gadget: move gadget resume after the core is in L0 state
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c935deacebb8fac8f41378701eb79d12f3c2e2d ]
    
    When the remote wakeup interrupt is triggered, lx_state is resumed from L2
    to L0 state. But when the gadget resume is called, lx_state is still L2.
    This prevents the resume callback to queue any request. Any attempt
    to queue a request from resume callback will result in:
    - "submit request only in active state" debug message to be issued
    - dwc2_hsotg_ep_queue() returns -EAGAIN
    
    Call the gadget resume routine after the core is in L0 state.

    watchdog: da9062: No need to ping manually before setting timeout
    
    [ Upstream commit a0948ddba65f4f6d3cfb5e2b84685485d0452966 ]
    
    There is actually no need to ping the watchdog before disabling it
    during timeout change. Disabling the watchdog already takes care of
    resetting the counter.
    
    This fixes an issue during boot when the userspace watchdog handler takes
    over and the watchdog is already running. Opening the watchdog in this case
    leads to the first ping and directly after that without the required
    heartbeat delay a second ping issued by the set_timeout call. Due to the
    missing delay this resulted in a reset.

    vfio-pci: Mask cap zero
    
    [ Upstream commit bc138db1b96264b9c1779cf18d5a3b186aa90066 ]
    
    The PCI Code and ID Assignment Specification changed capability ID 0
    from reserved to a NULL capability in the v1.1 revision.  The NULL
    capability is defined to include only the 16-bit capability header,
    ie. only the ID and next pointer.  Unfortunately vfio-pci creates a
    map of config space, where ID 0 is used to reserve the standard type
    0 header.  Finding an actual capability with this ID therefore results
    in a bogus range marked in that map and conflicts with subsequent
    capabilities.  As this seems to be a dummy capability anyway and we
    already support dropping capabilities, let's hide this one rather than
    delving into the potentially subtle dependencies within our map.
    
    Seen on an NVIDIA Tesla T4.

    powerpc/ps3: Fix kexec shutdown hang
    
    [ Upstream commit 126554465d93b10662742128918a5fc338cda4aa ]
    
    The ps3_mm_region_destroy() and ps3_mm_vas_destroy() routines
    are called very late in the shutdown via kexec's mmu_cleanup_all
    routine.  By the time mmu_cleanup_all runs it is too late to use
    udbg_printf, and calling it will cause PS3 systems to hang.
    
    Remove all debugging statements from ps3_mm_region_destroy() and
    ps3_mm_vas_destroy() and replace any error reporting with calls
    to lv1_panic.
    
    With this change builds with 'DEBUG' defined will not cause kexec
    reboots to hang, and builds with 'DEBUG' defined or not will end
    in lv1_panic if an error is encountered.

    [ Upstream commit deb70f7a35a22dffa55b2c3aac71bc6fb0f486ce ]
    
    This was discovered developing qemu fwnmi sreset support. This
    off-by-one bug means the last 16 bytes of the rtas area can not
    be used for a 16 byte save area.
    
    It's not a serious bug, and QEMU implementation has to retain a
    workaround for old kernels, but it's good to tighten it.

    tty: n_gsm: Fix SOF skipping
    
    [ Upstream commit 84d6f81c1fb58b56eba81ff0a36cf31946064b40 ]
    
    For at least some modems like the TELIT LE910, skipping SOF makes
    transfers blocking indefinitely after a short amount of data
    transferred.
    
    Given the small improvement provided by skipping the SOF (just one
    byte on about 100 bytes), it seems better to completely remove this
    "feature" than make it optional.

    dlm: remove BUG() before panic()
    
    [ Upstream commit fe204591cc9480347af7d2d6029b24a62e449486 ]
    
    Building a kernel with clang sometimes fails with an objtool error in dlm:
    
    fs/dlm/lock.o: warning: objtool: revert_lock_pc()+0xbd: can't find jump dest instruction at .text+0xd7fc
    
    The problem is that BUG() never returns and the compiler knows
    that anything after it is unreachable, however the panic still
    emits some code that does not get fully eliminated.
    
    Having both BUG() and panic() is really pointless as the BUG()
    kills the current process and the subsequent panic() never hits.
    In most cases, we probably don't really want either and should
    replace the DLM_ASSERT() statements with WARN_ON(), as has
    been done for some of them.
    
    Remove the BUG() here so the user at least sees the panic message
    and we can reliably build randconfig kernels.

    PCI/ASPM: Allow ASPM on links to PCIe-to-PCI/PCI-X Bridges
    
    [ Upstream commit 66ff14e59e8a30690755b08bc3042359703fb07a ]
    
    7d715a6c1ae5 ("PCI: add PCI Express ASPM support") added the ability for
    Linux to enable ASPM, but for some undocumented reason, it didn't enable
    ASPM on links where the downstream component is a PCIe-to-PCI/PCI-X Bridge.
    
    Remove this exclusion so we can enable ASPM on these links.
    
    The Dell OptiPlex 7080 mentioned in the bugzilla has a TI XIO2001
    PCIe-to-PCI Bridge.  Enabling ASPM on the link leading to it allows the
    Intel SoC to enter deeper Package C-states, which is a significant power
    savings.

    drivers: base: Fix NULL pointer exception in __platform_driver_probe() if a driver developer is foolish
    
    [ Upstream commit 388bcc6ecc609fca1b4920de7dc3806c98ec535e ]
    
    If platform bus driver registration is failed then, accessing
    platform bus spin lock (&drv->driver.bus->p->klist_drivers.k_lock)
    in __platform_driver_probe() without verifying the return value
    __platform_driver_register() can lead to NULL pointer exception.
    
    So check the return value before attempting the spin lock.
    
    One such example is below:
    
    For a custom usecase, I have intentionally failed the platform bus
    registration and I expected all the platform device/driver
    registrations to fail gracefully. But I came across this panic
    issue.

    Which seems to be due to the fact that after allocating the uap
    structure, nothing initializes the spinlock.
    
    Its a little confusing, as uart_port_spin_lock_init() is one
    place where the lock is supposed to be initialized, but it has
    an exception for the case where the port is a console.
    
    This makes it seem like a deeper fix is needed to properly
    register the console, but I'm not sure what that entails, and
    Andy suggested that this approach is less invasive.
    
    Thus, this patch resolves the issue by initializing the spinlock
    in the driver, and resolves the resulting warning.

    i2c: pxa: fix i2c_pxa_scream_blue_murder() debug output
    
    [ Upstream commit 88b73ee7ca4c90baf136ed5a8377fc5a9b73ac08 ]
    
    The IRQ log output is supposed to appear on a single line.  However,
    commit 3a2dc1677b60 ("i2c: pxa: Update debug function to dump more info
    on error") resulted in it being printed one-entry-per-line, which is
    excessively long.
    
    Fixing this is not a trivial matter; using pr_cont() doesn't work as
    the previous dev_dbg() may not have been compiled in, or may be
    dynamic.
    
    Since the rest of this function output is at error level, and is also
    debug output, promote this to error level as well to avoid this
    problem.
    
    Reduce the number of always zero prefix digits to save screen real-
    estate.

    tty: hvc: Fix data abort due to race in hvc_open
    
    [ Upstream commit e2bd1dcbe1aa34ff5570b3427c530e4332ecf0fe ]
    
    Potentially, hvc_open() can be called in parallel when two tasks calls
    open() on /dev/hvcX. In such a scenario, if the hp->ops->notifier_add()
    callback in the function fails, where it sets the tty->driver_data to
    NULL, the parallel hvc_open() can see this NULL and cause a memory abort.
    Hence, serialize hvc_open and check if tty->private_data is NULL before
    proceeding ahead.
    
    The issue can be easily reproduced by launching two tasks simultaneously
    that does nothing but open() and close() on /dev/hvcX.
    For example:
    $ ./simple_open_close /dev/hvc0 & ./simple_open_close /dev/hvc0 &

    s390/qdio: put thinint indicator after early error
    
    [ Upstream commit 75e82bec6b2622c6f455b7a543fb5476a5d0eed7 ]
    
    qdio_establish() calls qdio_setup_thinint() via qdio_setup_irq().
    If the subsequent qdio_establish_thinint() fails, we miss to put the
    DSCI again. Thus the DSCI isn't available for re-use. Given enough of
    such errors, we could end up with having only the shared DSCI available.
    
    Merge qdio_setup_thinint() into qdio_establish_thinint(), and deal with
    such an error internally.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Improve frames size computation
    
    [ Upstream commit f0bd62b64016508938df9babe47f65c2c727d25c ]
    
    For computation of the the next frame size current value of fs/fps and
    accumulated fractional parts of fs/fps are used, where values are stored
    in Q16.16 format. This is quite natural for computing frame size for
    asynchronous endpoints driven by explicit feedback, since in this case
    fs/fps is a value provided by the feedback endpoint and it's already in
    the Q format. If an error is accumulated over time, the device can
    adjust fs/fps value to prevent buffer overruns/underruns.
    
    But for synchronous endpoints the accuracy provided by these computations
    is not enough. Due to accumulated error the driver periodically produces
    frames with incorrect size (+/- 1 audio sample).
    
    This patch fixes this issue by implementing a different algorithm for
    frame size computation. It is based on accumulating of the remainders
    from division fs/fps and it doesn't accumulate errors over time. This
    new method is enabled for synchronous and adaptive playback endpoints.

    scsi: ibmvscsi: Don't send host info in adapter info MAD after LPM
    
    [ Upstream commit 4919b33b63c8b69d8dcf2b867431d0e3b6dc6d28 ]
    
    The adapter info MAD is used to send the client info and receive the host
    info as a response. A persistent buffer is used and as such the client info
    is overwritten after the response. During the course of a normal adapter
    reset the client info is refreshed in the buffer in preparation for sending
    the adapter info MAD.
    
    However, in the special case of LPM where we reenable the CRQ instead of a
    full CRQ teardown and reset we fail to refresh the client info in the
    adapter info buffer. As a result, after Live Partition Migration (LPM) we
    erroneously report the host's info as our own.

    mksysmap: Fix the mismatch of '.L' symbols in System.map
    
    [ Upstream commit 72d24accf02add25e08733f0ecc93cf10fcbd88c ]
    
    When System.map was generated, the kernel used mksysmap to
    filter the kernel symbols, but all the symbols with the
    second letter 'L' in the kernel were filtered out, not just
    the symbols starting with 'dot + L'.
    
    For example:
    ashimida@ubuntu:~/linux$ cat System.map |grep ' .L'
    ashimida@ubuntu:~/linux$ nm -n vmlinux |grep ' .L'

    ......
    ffff0000092e0408 b PLLP_OUTC_lock
    ffff0000092e0410 b PLLP_OUTA_lock
    
    The original intent should be to filter out all local symbols
    starting with '.L', so the dot should be escaped.

    powerpc/crashkernel: Take "mem=" option into account
    
    [ Upstream commit be5470e0c285a68dc3afdea965032f5ddc8269d7 ]
    
    'mem=" option is an easy way to put high pressure on memory during
    some test. Hence after applying the memory limit, instead of total
    mem, the actual usable memory should be considered when reserving mem
    for crashkernel. Otherwise the boot up may experience OOM issue.
    
    E.g. it would reserve 4G prior to the change and 512M afterward, if
    passing
    crashkernel="2G-4G:384M,4G-16G:512M,16G-64G:1G,64G-128G:2G,128G-:4G",
    and mem=5G on a 256G machine.
    
    This issue is powerpc specific because it puts higher priority on
    fadump and kdump reservation than on "mem=". Referring the following
    code:
        if (fadump_reserve_mem() == 0)
                reserve_crashkernel();
        ...
        /* Ensure that total memory size is page-aligned. */
        limit = ALIGN(memory_limit ?: memblock_phys_mem_size(), PAGE_SIZE);
        memblock_enforce_memory_limit(limit);
    
    While on other arches, the effect of "mem=" takes a higher priority
    and pass through memblock_phys_mem_size() before calling
    reserve_crashkernel().

    [ Upstream commit 7217e6e694da3aae6d17db8a7f7460c8d4817ebf ]
    
    In order to create or activate a new node, lpfc_els_unsol_buffer() invokes
    lpfc_nlp_init() or lpfc_enable_node() or lpfc_nlp_get(), all of them will

    increased refcnt.
    
    When lpfc_els_unsol_buffer() returns, local variable "ndlp" becomes
    invalid, so the refcount should be decreased to keep refcount balanced.
    
    The reference counting issue happens in one exception handling path of

    [ Upstream commit d4f9b5428b53dd67f49ee8deed8d4366ed6b1933 ]
    
    WM8994 chip has built-in regulators, which might be used for chip
    operation. They are controlled by a separate wm8994-regulator driver,
    which should be loaded before this driver calls regulator_get(), because
    that driver also provides consumer-supply mapping for the them. If that
    driver is not yet loaded, regulator core substitute them with dummy
    regulator, what breaks chip operation, because the built-in regulators are
    never enabled. Fix this by annotating this driver with MODULE_SOFTDEP()
    "pre" dependency to "wm8994_regulator" module.

    The problem originates from setting the segment boundary of the
    request queue to -1UL. This makes get_max_segment_size() return zero
    when offset is zero, whatever the max segment size. The test with
    BLK_SEG_BOUNDARY_MASK fails and 'mask - (mask & offset) + 1' overflows
    to zero in the return statement.
    
    Not setting the segment boundary and using the default
    value (BLK_SEG_BOUNDARY_MASK) fixes the problem.

    clk: qcom: msm8916: Fix the address location of pll->config_reg
    
    [ Upstream commit f47ab3c2f5338828a67e89d5f688d2cef9605245 ]
    
    During the process of debugging a processor derived from the msm8916 which
    we found the new processor was not starting one of its PLLs.
    
    After tracing the addresses and writes that downstream was doing and
    comparing to upstream it became obvious that we were writing to a different
    register location than downstream when trying to configure the PLL.
    
    This error is also present in upstream msm8916.
    
    As an example clk-pll.c::clk_pll_recalc_rate wants to write to
    pll->config_reg updating the bit-field POST_DIV_RATIO. That bit-field is
    defined in PLL_USER_CTL not in PLL_CONFIG_CTL. Taking the BIMC PLL as an
    example
    
    lm80-p0436-13_c_qc_snapdragon_410_processor_hrd.pdf
    
    0x01823010 GCC_BIMC_PLL_USER_CTL
    0x01823014 GCC_BIMC_PLL_CONFIG_CTL
    
    This pattern is repeated for gpll0, gpll1, gpll2 and bimc_pll.
    
    This error is likely not apparent since the bootloader will already have
    initialized these PLLs.
    
    This patch corrects the location of config_reg from PLL_CONFIG_CTL to
    PLL_USER_CTL for all relevant PLLs on msm8916.
    
    Fixes commit 3966fab8b6ab ("clk: qcom: Add MSM8916 Global Clock Controller support")

    i2c: piix4: Detect secondary SMBus controller on AMD AM4 chipsets
    
    [ Upstream commit f27237c174fd9653033330e4e532cd9d153ce824 ]
    
    The AMD X370 and other AM4 chipsets (A/B/X 3/4/5 parts) and Threadripper
    equivalents have a secondary SMBus controller at I/O port address
    0x0B20.  This bus is used by several manufacturers to control
    motherboard RGB lighting via embedded controllers.  I have been using
    this bus in my OpenRGB project to control the Aura RGB on many
    motherboards and ASRock also uses this bus for their Polychrome RGB
    controller.
    
    I am not aware of any CZ-compatible platforms which do not have the
    second SMBus channel.  All of AMD's AM4- and Threadripper- series
    chipsets that OpenRGB users have tested appear to have this secondary
    bus.  I also noticed this secondary bus is present on older AMD
    platforms including my FM1 home server.

    round_down() can only round to powers of 2. If round_down() is asked
    to round to something that is not a power of 2, incorrect results are
    produced. The incorrect results can be both too large and too small.
    
    Instead, use rounddown() which can round to any number.

    s390: fix syscall_get_error for compat processes
    
    commit b3583fca5fb654af2cfc1c08259abb9728272538 upstream.
    
    If both the tracer and the tracee are compat processes, and gprs[2]
    is assigned a value by __poke_user_compat, then the higher 32 bits
    of gprs[2] are cleared, IS_ERR_VALUE() always returns false, and
    syscall_get_error() always returns 0.
    
    Fix the implementation by sign-extending the value for compat processes
    the same way as x86 implementation does.
    
    The bug was exposed to user space by commit 201766a20e30f ("ptrace: add
    PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO request") and detected by strace test suite.
    
    This change fixes strace syscall tampering on s390.
