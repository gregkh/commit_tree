    commit 1534efc7bbc1121e92c86c2dabebaf2c9dcece19 upstream.
    
    This patch stops dumping llsec params for monitors which we don't support
    yet. Otherwise we will access llsec mib which isn't initialized for
    monitors.

    gpiolib: Read "gpio-line-names" from a firmware node
    
    commit b41ba2ec54a70908067034f139aa23d0dd2985ce upstream.
    
    On STM32MP1, the GPIO banks are subnodes of pin-controller@50002000,
    see arch/arm/boot/dts/stm32mp151.dtsi. The driver for
    pin-controller@50002000 is in drivers/pinctrl/stm32/pinctrl-stm32.c
    and iterates over all of its DT subnodes when registering each GPIO
    bank gpiochip. Each gpiochip has:
    
      - gpio_chip.parent = dev,
        where dev is the device node of the pin controller
      - gpio_chip.of_node = np,
        which is the OF node of the GPIO bank
    
    Therefore, dev_fwnode(chip->parent) != of_fwnode_handle(chip.of_node),
    i.e. pin-controller@50002000 != pin-controller@50002000/gpio@5000*000.
    
    The original code behaved correctly, as it extracted the "gpio-line-names"
    from of_fwnode_handle(chip.of_node) = pin-controller@50002000/gpio@5000*000.
    
    To achieve the same behaviour, read property from the firmware node.

    x86/traps: Correct exc_general_protection() and math_error() return paths
    
    commit 632a1c209b8773cb0119fe3aada9f1db14fa357c upstream.
    
    Commit
    
      334872a09198 ("x86/traps: Attempt to fixup exceptions in vDSO before signaling")
    
    added return statements which bypass calling cond_local_irq_disable().
    
    According to
    
      ca4c6a9858c2 ("x86/traps: Make interrupt enable/disable symmetric in C code"),
    
    cond_local_irq_disable() is needed because the asm return code no longer
    disables interrupts. Follow the existing code as an example to use "goto
    exit" instead of "return" statement.

    net: sched: bump refcount for new action in ACT replace mode
    
    commit 6855e8213e06efcaf7c02a15e12b1ae64b9a7149 upstream.
    
    Currently, action creation using ACT API in replace mode is buggy.
    When invoking for non-existent action index 42,
    
            tc action replace action bpf obj foo.o sec <xyz> index 42
    
    kernel creates the action, fills up the netlink response, and then just
    deletes the action after notifying userspace.
    
            tc action show action bpf
    
    doesn't list the action.
    
    This happens due to the following sequence when ovr = 1 (replace mode)
    is enabled:
    
    tcf_idr_check_alloc is used to atomically check and either obtain
    reference for existing action at index, or reserve the index slot using
    a dummy entry (ERR_PTR(-EBUSY)).
    
    This is necessary as pointers to these actions will be held after
    dropping the idrinfo lock, so bumping the reference count is necessary
    as we need to insert the actions, and notify userspace by dumping their
    attributes. Finally, we drop the reference we took using the
    tcf_action_put_many call in tcf_action_add. However, for the case where
    a new action is created due to free index, its refcount remains one.
    This when paired with the put_many call leads to the kernel setting up
    the action, notifying userspace of its creation, and then tearing it
    down. For existing actions, the refcount is still held so they remain
    unaffected.
    
    Fortunately due to rtnl_lock serialization requirement, such an action
    with refcount == 1 will not be concurrently deleted by anything else, at
    best CLS API can move its refcount up and down by binding to it after it
    has been published from tcf_idr_insert_many. Since refcount is atleast
    one until put_many call, CLS API cannot delete it. Also __tcf_action_put
    release path already ensures deterministic outcome (either new action
    will be created or existing action will be reused in case CLS API tries
    to bind to action concurrently) due to idr lock serialization.
    
    We fix this by making refcount of newly created actions as 2 in ACT API
    replace mode. A relaxed store will suffice as visibility is ensured only
    after the tcf_idr_insert_many call.
    
    Note that in case of creation or overwriting using CLS API only (i.e.
    bind = 1), overwriting existing action object is not allowed, and any
    such request is silently ignored (without error).
    
    The refcount bump that occurs in tcf_idr_check_alloc call there for
    existing action will pair with tcf_exts_destroy call made from the
    owner module for the same action. In case of action creation, there
    is no existing action, so no tcf_exts_destroy callback happens.
    
    This means no code changes for CLS API.

    lockdep: Address clang -Wformat warning printing for %hd
    
    commit 6d48b7912cc72275dc7c59ff961c8bac7ef66a92 upstream.
    
    Clang doesn't like format strings that truncate a 32-bit
    value to something shorter:
    
      kernel/locking/lockdep.c:709:4: error: format specifies type 'short' but the argument has type 'int' [-Werror,-Wformat]
    
    In this case, the warning is a slightly questionable, as it could realize
    that both class->wait_type_outer and class->wait_type_inner are in fact
    8-bit struct members, even though the result of the ?: operator becomes an
    'int'.
    
    However, there is really no point in printing the number as a 16-bit
    'short' rather than either an 8-bit or 32-bit number, so just change
    it to a normal %d.

    perf report: Fix wrong LBR block sorting
    
    [ Upstream commit f2013278ae40b89cc27916366c407ce5261815ef ]
    
    When '--total-cycles' is specified, it supports sorting for all blocks
    by 'Sampled Cycles%'. This is useful to concentrate on the globally
    hottest blocks.
    
    'Sampled Cycles%' - block sampled cycles aggregation / total sampled cycles
    
    But in current code, it doesn't use the cycles aggregation. Part of
    'cycles' counting is possibly dropped for some overlap jumps. But for
    identifying the hot block, we always need the full cycles.

    [ Upstream commit ed7bedd2c3ca040f1e8ea02c6590a93116b1ec78 ]
    
    Currently, the VF down state bit is cleared after VF sending
    link status request command. There is problem that when VF gets
    link status replied from PF, the down state bit may still set
    as 1. In this case, the link status replied from PF will be
    ignored and always set VF link status to down.
    
    To fix this problem, clear VF down state bit before VF requests

    the tmp attached by tipc_crypto_key_attach() in one thread may be released
    by the one attached by that in the other thread.

    Some devices send (duplicate) tablet-mode events when moved around even
    though the mode has not changed; and they do this even when suspended.
    
    Change the tablet-mode event handling when priv->wakeup_mode is set to
    update the switch state in case it changed and then return immediately
    (without calling pm_wakeup_hard_event()) to avoid spurious wakeups.

    can: mcp251x: fix support for half duplex SPI host controllers
    
    [ Upstream commit 617085fca6375e2c1667d1fbfc6adc4034c85f04 ]
    
    Some SPI host controllers do not support full-duplex SPI transfers.
    
    The function mcp251x_spi_trans() does a full duplex transfer. It is
    used in several places in the driver, where a TX half duplex transfer
    is sufficient.
    
    To fix support for half duplex SPI host controllers, this patch
    introduces a new function mcp251x_spi_write() and changes all callers
    that do a TX half duplex transfer to use mcp251x_spi_write().

    changed and the bit remained as bit 10, like in version 1.  This was

    openvswitch: fix send of uninitialized stack memory in ct limit reply
    
    [ Upstream commit 4d51419d49930be2701c2633ae271b350397c3ca ]
    
    'struct ovs_zone_limit' has more members than initialized in
    ovs_ct_limit_get_default_limit().  The rest of the memory is a random
    kernel stack content that ends up being sent to userspace.
    
    Fix that by using designated initializer that will clear all
    non-specified fields.

    perf inject: Fix repipe usage
    
    [ Upstream commit 026334a3bb6a3919b42aba9fc11843db2b77fd41 ]
    
    Since commit 14d3d54052539a1e ("perf session: Try to read pipe data from
    file") 'perf inject' has started printing "PERFILE2h" when not processing
    pipes.
    
    The commit exposed perf to the possiblity that the input is not a pipe
    but the 'repipe' parameter gets used. That causes the printing because
    perf inject sets 'repipe' to true always.
    
    The 'repipe' parameter of perf_session__new() is used by 2 functions:
    
            - perf_file_header__read_pipe()
            - trace_report()
    
    In both cases, the functions copy data to STDOUT_FILENO when 'repipe' is
    true.
    
    Fix by setting 'repipe' to true only if the output is a pipe.

    clk: fix invalid usage of list cursor in unregister
    
    [ Upstream commit 7045465500e465b09f09d6e5bdc260a9f1aab97b ]
    
    Fix invalid usage of a list_for_each_entry cursor in
    clk_notifier_unregister(). When list is empty or if the list
    is completely traversed (without breaking from the loop on one
    of the entries) then the list cursor does not point to a valid
    entry and therefore should not be used. The patch fixes a logical
    bug that hasn't been seen in pratice however it is analogus
    to the bug fixed in clk_notifier_register().
    
    The issue was dicovered when running 5.12-rc1 kernel on x86_64

    net: udp: Add support for getsockopt(..., ..., UDP_GRO, ..., ...);
    
    [ Upstream commit 98184612aca0a9ee42b8eb0262a49900ee9eef0d ]
    
    Support for UDP_GRO was added in the past but the implementation for
    getsockopt was missed which did lead to an error when we tried to
    retrieve the setting for UDP_GRO. This patch adds the missing switch
    case for UDP_GRO

    drm/msm: Set drvdata to NULL when msm_drm_init() fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 5620b135aea49a8f41c86aaecfcb1598a7774121 ]
    
    We should set the platform device's driver data to NULL here so that
    code doesn't assume the struct drm_device pointer is valid when it could
    have been destroyed. The lifetime of this pointer is managed by a kref
    but when msm_drm_init() fails we call drm_dev_put() on the pointer which
    will free the pointer's memory. This driver uses the component model, so
    there's sort of two "probes" in this file, one for the platform device
    i.e. msm_pdev_probe() and one for the component i.e. msm_drm_bind(). The
    msm_drm_bind() code is using the platform device's driver data to store
    struct drm_device so the two functions are intertwined.
    
    This relationship becomes a problem for msm_pdev_shutdown() when it
    tests the NULL-ness of the pointer to see if it should call
    drm_atomic_helper_shutdown(). The NULL test is a proxy check for if the
    pointer has been freed by kref_put(). If the drm_device has been
    destroyed, then we shouldn't call the shutdown helper, and we know that
    is the case if msm_drm_init() failed, therefore set the driver data to
    NULL so that this pointer liveness is tracked properly.

    When rtrs_clt_close is triggered, it iterates over all the present
    rtrs_clt_sess and triggers close on them. However, the call to
    rtrs_clt_destroy_sess_files is done before the rtrs_clt_close_conns. This
    is incorrect since during the initialization phase we allocate
    rtrs_clt_sess first, and then we go ahead and create rtrs_clt_con for it.
    
    If we free the rtrs_clt_sess structure before closing the rtrs_clt_con, it
    may so happen that an inflight IO completion would trigger the function
    rtrs_clt_rdma_done, which would lead to the above UAF case.
    
    Hence close the rtrs_clt_con connections first, and then trigger the
    destruction of session files.

    i40e: Fix display statistics for veb_tc

    If veb-stats was enabled, the ethtool stats triggered a warning
    due to invalid size: 'unexpected stat size for veb.tc_%u_tx_packets'.
    This was due to an incorrect structure definition for the statistics.
    Structures and functions have been improved in line with requirements
    for the presentation of statistics, in particular for the functions:
    'i40e_add_ethtool_stats' and 'i40e_add_stat_strings'.

    i40e: fix receiving of single packets in xsk zero-copy mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 528060ef3e1105c5c3eba66ffbfc80e0825e2cce ]
    
    Fix so that single packets are received immediately instead of in
    batches of 8. If you sent 1 pps to a system, you received 8 packets
    every 8 seconds instead of 1 packet every second. The problem behind
    this was that the work_done reporting from the Tx part of the driver
    was broken. The work_done reporting in i40e controls not only the
    reporting back to the napi logic but also the setting of the interrupt
    throttling logic. When Tx or Rx reports that it has more to do,
    interrupts are throttled or coalesced and when they both report that
    they are done, interrupts are armed right away. If the wrong work_done
    value is returned, the logic will start to throttle interrupts in a
    situation where it should have just enabled them. This leads to the
    undesired batching behavior seen in user-space.
    
    Fix this by returning the correct boolean value from the Tx xsk
    zero-copy path. Return true if there is nothing to do or if we got
    fewer packets to process than we asked for. Return false if we got as
    many packets as the budget since there might be more packets we can
    process.

    the doorbell on the async ICOSQ.
    It maintains its state so that it doesn't issue another NOP WQE
    if it has an outstanding one already.
    
    For this flow to work properly, the NOP post must not fail.

    net/mlx5: Delete auxiliary bus driver eth-rep first
    
    [ Upstream commit 1f90aedfb496ccccf862c7b7c0889af20c2fc61a ]
    
    Delete auxiliary bus drivers flow deletes the eth driver
    first and then the eth-reps driver but eth-reps devices resources
    are depend on eth device.
    
    Fixed by changing the delete order of auxiliary bus drivers to delete
    the eth-rep driver first and after it the eth driver.

    net/mlx5e: Fix mapping of ct_label zero
    
    [ Upstream commit d24f847e54214049814b9515771622eaab3f42ab ]
    
    ct_label 0 is a default label each flow has and therefore
    there can be rules that match on ct_label=0 without a prior
    rule that set the ct_label to this value.
    
    The ct_label value is not used directly in the HW rules and
    instead it is mapped to some id within a defined range and this
    id is used to set and match the metadata register which carries
    the ct_label.
    
    If we have a rule that matches on ct_label=0, the hw rule will
    perform matching on a value that is != 0 because of the mapping
    from label to id. Since the metadata register default value is
    0 and it was never set before to anything else by an action that
    sets the ct_label, there will always be a mismatch between that
    register and the value in the rule.
    
    To support such rule, a forced mapping of ct_label 0 to id=0
    is done so that it will match the metadata register default
    value of 0.

    [ Upstream commit 03cb4d05b4ea9a3491674ca40952adb708d549fa ]
    
    Calling ncsi_stop_channel_monitor from channel_monitor is a guaranteed
    deadlock on SMP because stop calls del_timer_sync on the timer that
    invoked channel_monitor as its timer function.
    
    Recognise the inherent race of marking the monitor disabled before
    deleting the timer by just returning if enable was cleared.  After
    a timeout (the default case -- reset to START when response received)
    just mark the monitor.enabled false.
    
    If the channel has an entry on the channel_queue list, or if the
    state is not ACTIVE or INACTIVE, then warn and mark the timer stopped
    and don't restart, as the locking is broken somehow.

    and returns the skb which equals to skb_peek(arrvq). After __skb_dequeue(arrvq)
    finished, the skb is freed by kfree_skb(__skb_dequeue(arrvq)) in the first time.
    
    Unfortunately, the same skb is freed in the second time by kfree_skb(skb) after
    the branch completed.
    
    My patch removes kfree_skb() in the if(skb_peek(arrvq) == skb) branch, because

    mlxsw: spectrum: Fix ECN marking in tunnel decapsulation
    
    [ Upstream commit 66167c310deb4ac1725f81004fb4b504676ad0bf ]
    
    Cited commit changed the behavior of the software data path with regards
    to the ECN marking of decapsulated packets. However, the commit did not
    change other callers of __INET_ECN_decapsulate(), namely mlxsw. The
    driver is using the function in order to ensure that the hardware and
    software data paths act the same with regards to the ECN marking of
    decapsulated packets.
    
    The discrepancy was uncovered by commit 5aa3c334a449 ("selftests:
    forwarding: vxlan_bridge_1d: Fix vxlan ecn decapsulate value") that
    aligned the selftest to the new behavior. Without this patch the
    selftest passes when used with veth pairs, but fails when used with
    mlxsw netdevs.
    
    Fix this by instructing the device to propagate the ECT(1) mark from the
    outer header to the inner header when the inner header is ECT(0), for
    both NVE and IP-in-IP tunnels.
    
    A helper is added in order not to duplicate the code between both tunnel
    types.

    can: uapi: can.h: mark union inside struct can_frame packed
    
    [ Upstream commit f5076c6ba02e8e24c61c40bbf48078929bc0fc79 ]
    
    In commit ea7800565a12 ("can: add optional DLC element to Classical
    CAN frame structure") the struct can_frame::can_dlc was put into an
    anonymous union with another u8 variable.
    
    For various reasons some members in struct can_frame and canfd_frame
    including the first 8 byes of data are expected to have the same
    memory layout. This is enforced by a BUILD_BUG_ON check in af_can.c.
    
    Since the above mentioned commit this check fails on ARM kernels
    compiled with the ARM OABI (which means CONFIG_AEABI not set). In this
    case -mabi=apcs-gnu is passed to the compiler, which leads to a
    structure size boundary of 32, instead of 8 compared to CONFIG_AEABI
    enabled. This means the the union in struct can_frame takes 4 bytes
    instead of the expected 1.
    
    Rong Chen illustrates the problem with pahole in the ARM OABI case:
    
    | struct can_frame {
    |          canid_t                    can_id;               /* 0     4 */
    |          union {
    |                  __u8               len;                  /* 4     1 */

    [ Upstream commit f522d9559b07854c231cf8f0b8cb5a3578f8b44e ]
    
    Since commit f5223e9eee65 ("can: extend sockaddr_can to include j1939

    a problem when an existing binary reads the (increased) struct

    Commit 94579ac3f6d0 ("xfrm: Fix double ESP trailer insertion in IPsec
    crypto offload.") added a XFRM_XMIT flag to avoid duplicate ESP trailer
    insertion on HW offload. This flag is set on the secpath that is shared
    amongst segments. This lead to a situation where some segments are
    not transformed correctly when segmentation happens at layer 3.
    
    Fix this by using private skb extensions for segmented and hw offloaded
    ESP packets.

    geneve: do not modify the shared tunnel info when PMTU triggers an ICMP reply
    
    [ Upstream commit 68c1a943ef37bafde5ea2383e8ca224c7169ee31 ]
    
    When the interface is part of a bridge or an Open vSwitch port and a
    packet exceed a PMTU estimate, an ICMP reply is sent to the sender. When
    using the external mode (collect metadata) the source and destination
    addresses are reversed, so that Open vSwitch can match the packet
    against an existing (reverse) flow.
    
    But inverting the source and destination addresses in the shared
    ip_tunnel_info will make following packets of the flow to use a wrong
    destination address (packets will be tunnelled to itself), if the flow
    isn't updated. Which happens with Open vSwitch, until the flow times
    out.
    
    Fixes this by uncloning the skb's ip_tunnel_info before inverting its
    source and destination addresses, so that the modification will only be
    made for the PTMU packet, not the following ones.

    xfrm: Fix NULL pointer dereference on policy lookup
    
    [ Upstream commit b1e3a5607034aa0a481c6f69a6893049406665fb ]
    
    When xfrm interfaces are used in combination with namespaces
    and ESP offload, we get a dst_entry NULL pointer dereference.
    This is because we don't have a dst_entry attached in the ESP
    offloading case and we need to do a policy lookup before the
    namespace transition.
    
    Fix this by expicit checking of skb_dst(skb) before accessing it.

    ASoC: wm8960: Fix wrong bclk and lrclk with pll enabled for some chips
    
    [ Upstream commit 16b82e75c15a7dbd564ea3654f3feb61df9e1e6f ]
    
    The input MCLK is 12.288MHz, the desired output sysclk is 11.2896MHz
    and sample rate is 44100Hz, with the configuration pllprescale=2,
    postscale=sysclkdiv=1, some chip may have wrong bclk
    and lrclk output with pll enabled in master mode, but with the
    configuration pllprescale=1, postscale=2, the output clock is correct.
    
    >From Datasheet, the PLL performs best when f2 is between
    90MHz and 100MHz when the desired sysclk output is 11.2896MHz
    or 12.288MHz, so sysclkdiv = 2 (f2/8) is the best choice.
    
    So search available sysclk_divs from 2 to 1 other than from 1 to 2.

    esp: delete NETIF_F_SCTP_CRC bit from features for esp offload
    
    [ Upstream commit 154deab6a3ba47792936edf77f2f13a1cbc4351d ]
    
    Now in esp4/6_gso_segment(), before calling inner proto .gso_segment,
    NETIF_F_CSUM_MASK bits are deleted, as HW won't be able to do the
    csum for inner proto due to the packet encrypted already.
    
    So the UDP/TCP packet has to do the checksum on its own .gso_segment.
    But SCTP is using CRC checksum, and for that NETIF_F_SCTP_CRC should
    be deleted to make SCTP do the csum in own .gso_segment as well.
    
    In Xiumei's testing with SCTP over IPsec/veth, the packets are kept
    dropping due to the wrong CRC checksum.

    net: xfrm: Localize sequence counter per network namespace
    
    [ Upstream commit e88add19f68191448427a6e4eb059664650a837f ]
    
    A sequence counter write section must be serialized or its internal
    state can get corrupted. The "xfrm_state_hash_generation" seqcount is
    global, but its write serialization lock (net->xfrm.xfrm_state_lock) is
    instantiated per network namespace. The write protection is thus
    insufficient.
    
    To provide full protection, localize the sequence counter per network
    namespace instead. This should be safe as both the seqcount read and
    write sections access data exclusively within the network namespace. It
    also lays the foundation for transforming "xfrm_state_hash_generation"
    data type from seqcount_t to seqcount_LOCKNAME_t in further commits.

    remoteproc: pru: Fix firmware loading crashes on K3 SoCs
    
    [ Upstream commit 9afeefcf06fc7b4bdab06a6e2cb06745bded34dd ]
    
    The K3 PRUs are 32-bit processors and in general have some limitations
    in using the standard ARMv8 memcpy function for loading firmware segments,
    so the driver already uses a custom memcpy implementation. This added
    logic however is limited to only IRAMs at the moment, but the loading
    into Data RAMs is not completely ok either and does generate a kernel
    crash for unaligned accesses.
    
    Fix these crashes by removing the existing IRAM logic limitation and
    extending the custom memcpy usage to Data RAMs as well for all K3 SoCs.

    ARM: OMAP4: PM: update ROM return address for OSWR and OFF
    
    [ Upstream commit b3d09a06d89f474cb52664e016849315a97e09d9 ]
    
    We need to add a dummy smc call to the cpuidle wakeup path to force the
    ROM code to save the return address after MMU is enabled again. This is
    needed to prevent random hangs on secure devices like droid4.
    
    Otherwise the system will eventually hang when entering deeper SoC idle
    states with the core and mpu domains in open-switch retention (OSWR).
    The hang happens as the ROM code tries to use the earlier physical return
    address set by omap-headsmp.S with MMU off while waking up CPU1 again.
    
    The hangs started happening in theory already with commit caf8c87d7ff2
    ("ARM: OMAP2+: Allow core oswr for omap4"), but in practise the issue went
    unnoticed as various drivers were often blocking any deeper idle states
    with hardware autoidle features.
    
    This patch is based on an earlier TI Linux kernel tree commit 92f0b3028d9e
    ("OMAP4: PM: update ROM return address for OSWR and OFF") written by
    Carlos Leija <cileija@ti.com>, Praneeth Bajjuri <praneeth@ti.com>, and

    xfrm: Use actual socket sk instead of skb socket for xfrm_output_resume
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ab1265d52314fce1b51e8665ea6dbc9ac1a027c ]
    
    A situation can occur where the interface bound to the sk is different
    to the interface bound to the sk attached to the skb. The interface
    bound to the sk is the correct one however this information is lost inside
    xfrm_output2 and instead the sk on the skb is used in xfrm_output_resume
    instead. This assumes that the sk bound interface and the bound interface
    attached to the sk within the skb are the same which can lead to lookup
    failures inside ip_route_me_harder resulting in the packet being dropped.
    
    We have an l2tp v3 tunnel with ipsec protection. The tunnel is in the
    global VRF however we have an encapsulated dot1q tunnel interface that
    is within a different VRF. We also have a mangle rule that marks the
    packets causing them to be processed inside ip_route_me_harder.
    
    Prior to commit 31c70d5956fc ("l2tp: keep original skb ownership") this
    worked fine as the sk attached to the skb was changed from the dot1q
    encapsulated interface to the sk for the tunnel which meant the interface
    bound to the sk and the interface bound to the skb were identical.
    Commit 46d6c5ae953c ("netfilter: use actual socket sk rather than skb sk
    when routing harder") fixed some of these issues however a similar
    problem existed in the xfrm code.

    iSCSI can use both TCP ports 860 and 3260. However, in our current
    implementation, the ice_aqc_opc_get_cee_dcb_cfg (0x0A07) AQ command
    doesn't provide a way to communicate the protocol port number to the

    determine which port number that iSCSI will use.

    net: sched: fix err handler in tcf_action_init()
    
    [ Upstream commit b3650bf76a32380d4d80a3e21b5583e7303f216c ]
    
    With recent changes that separated action module load from action
    initialization tcf_action_init() function error handling code was modified
    to manually release the loaded modules if loading/initialization of any
    further action in same batch failed. For the case when all modules
    successfully loaded and some of the actions were initialized before one of
    them failed in init handler. In this case for all previous actions the
    module will be released twice by the error handler: First time by the loop
    that manually calls module_put() for all ops, and second time by the action
    destroy code that puts the module after destroying the action.
    
    Reproduction:
    
    $ sudo tc actions add action simple sdata \"2\" index 2
    $ sudo tc actions add action simple sdata \"1\" index 1 \
                          action simple sdata \"2\" index 2
    RTNETLINK answers: File exists
    We have an error talking to the kernel
    $ sudo tc actions ls action simple
    total acts 1
    
            action order 0: Simple <"2">
             index 2 ref 1 bind 0
    $ sudo tc actions flush action simple
    $ sudo tc actions ls action simple
    $ sudo tc actions add action simple sdata \"2\" index 2
    Error: Failed to load TC action module.
    We have an error talking to the kernel
    $ lsmod | grep simple
    act_simple             20480  -1
    
    Fix the issue by modifying module reference counting handling in action
    initialization code:
    
    - Get module reference in tcf_idr_create() and put it in tcf_idr_release()
    instead of taking over the reference held by the caller.
    
    - Modify users of tcf_action_init_1() to always release the module
    reference which they obtain before calling init function instead of
    assuming that created action takes over the reference.
    
    - Finally, modify tcf_action_init_1() to not release the module reference
    when overwriting existing action as this is no longer necessary since both
    upper and lower layers obtain and manage their own module references
    independently.

    KVM: x86/mmu: preserve pending TLB flush across calls to kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_sp
    
    [ Upstream commit 315f02c60d9425b38eb8ad7f21b8a35e40db23f9 ]
    
    Right now, if a call to kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_sp returns false, the caller
    will skip the TLB flush, which is wrong.  There are two ways to fix
    it:
    
    - since kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_sp will not yield and therefore will not flush
      the TLB itself, we could change the call to kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_sp to
      use "flush |= ..."
    
    - or we can chain the flush argument through kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_sp down
      to __kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_gfn_range.  Note that kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_sp will
      neither yield nor flush, so flush would never go from true to
      false.
    
    This patch does the former to simplify application to stable kernels,
    and to make it further clearer that kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_sp will not flush.

    KVM: x86/mmu: Don't allow TDP MMU to yield when recovering NX pages
    
    [ Upstream commit 33a3164161fc86b9cc238f7f2aa2ccb1d5559b1c ]
    
    Prevent the TDP MMU from yielding when zapping a gfn range during NX
    page recovery.  If a flush is pending from a previous invocation of the
    zapping helper, either in the TDP MMU or the legacy MMU, but the TDP MMU
    has not accumulated a flush for the current invocation, then yielding
    will release mmu_lock with stale TLB entries.
    
    That being said, this isn't technically a bug fix in the current code, as
    the TDP MMU will never yield in this case.  tdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched()
    will yield if and only if it has made forward progress, as defined by the
    current gfn vs. the last yielded (or starting) gfn.  Because zapping a
    single shadow page is guaranteed to (a) find that page and (b) step
    sideways at the level of the shadow page, the TDP iter will break its loop
    before getting a chance to yield.
    
    But that is all very, very subtle, and will break at the slightest sneeze,
    e.g. zapping while holding mmu_lock for read would break as the TDP MMU
    wouldn't be guaranteed to see the present shadow page, and thus could step
    sideways at a lower level.

    Honor the "flush needed" return from kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_gfn_range(), which
    does the flush itself if and only if it yields (which it will never do in
    this particular scenario), and otherwise expects the caller to do the
    flush.  If pages are zapped from the TDP MMU but not the legacy MMU, then
    no flush will occur.

    KVM: x86/mmu: Ensure TLBs are flushed when yielding during GFN range zap
    
    [ Upstream commit a835429cda91621fca915d80672a157b47738afb ]
    
    When flushing a range of GFNs across multiple roots, ensure any pending
    flush from a previous root is honored before yielding while walking the
    tables of the current root.
    
    Note, kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_gfn_range() now intentionally overwrites its local
    "flush" with the result to avoid redundant flushes.  zap_gfn_range()
    preserves and return the incoming "flush", unless of course the flush was
    performed prior to yielding and no new flush was triggered.

    [ Upstream commit 1af4a96025b33587ca953c7ef12a1b20c6e70412 ]
    
    Given certain conditions, some TDP MMU functions may not yield
    reliably / frequently enough. For example, if a paging structure was
    very large but had few, if any writable entries, wrprot_gfn_range
    could traverse many entries before finding a writable entry and yielding
    because the check for yielding only happens after an SPTE is modified.
    
    Fix this issue by moving the yield to the beginning of the loop.

    KVM: x86/mmu: Ensure forward progress when yielding in TDP MMU iter
    
    [ Upstream commit ed5e484b79e8a9b8be714bd85b6fc70bd6dc99a7 ]
    
    In some functions the TDP iter risks not making forward progress if two
    threads livelock yielding to one another. This is possible if two threads
    are trying to execute wrprot_gfn_range. Each could write protect an entry
    and then yield. This would reset the tdp_iter's walk over the paging
    structure and the loop would end up repeating the same entry over and
    over, preventing either thread from making forward progress.
    
    Fix this issue by only yielding if the loop has made forward progress
    since the last yield.

    KVM: x86/mmu: change TDP MMU yield function returns to match cond_resched
    
    [ Upstream commit e28a436ca4f65384cceaf3f4da0e00aa74244e6a ]
    
    Currently the TDP MMU yield / cond_resched functions either return
    nothing or return true if the TLBs were not flushed. These are confusing
    semantics, especially when making control flow decisions in calling
    functions.
    
    To clean things up, change both functions to have the same
    return value semantics as cond_resched: true if the thread yielded,
    false if it did not. If the function yielded in the _flush_ version,
    then the TLBs will have been flushed.

    commit 0760fa3d8f7fceeea508b98899f1c826e10ffe78 upstream.
    
    nr_empty_pop_pages is used to guarantee that there are some free
    populated pages to satisfy atomic allocations. Accounted and
    non-accounted allocations are using separate sets of chunks,
    so both need to have a surplus of empty pages.
    
    This commit makes pcpu_nr_empty_pop_pages and the corresponding logic
    per chunk type.

    This issue came up as I was reviewing [1] and realized I missed this.
    Simultaneously, it was reported btrfs was seeing failed atomic
    allocations in fsstress tests [2] and [3].

    scsi: target: iscsi: Fix zero tag inside a trace event
    
    commit 0352c3d3959a6cf543075b88c7e662fd3546f12e upstream.
    
    target_sequencer_start event is triggered inside target_cmd_init_cdb().
    se_cmd.tag is not initialized with ITT at the moment so the event always
    prints zero tag.

    usbip: add sysfs_lock to synchronize sysfs code paths
    
    commit 4e9c93af7279b059faf5bb1897ee90512b258a12 upstream.
    
    Fuzzing uncovered race condition between sysfs code paths in usbip
    drivers. Device connect/disconnect code paths initiated through
    sysfs interface are prone to races if disconnect happens during
    connect and vice versa.
    
    This problem is common to all drivers while it can be reproduced easily
    in vhci_hcd. Add a sysfs_lock to usbip_device struct to protect the paths.
    
    Use this in vhci_hcd to protect sysfs paths. For a complete fix, usip_host
    and usip-vudc drivers and the event handler will have to use this lock to
    protect the paths. These changes will be done in subsequent patches.

    net: let skb_orphan_partial wake-up waiters.
    
    commit 9adc89af724f12a03b47099cd943ed54e877cd59 upstream.
    
    Currently the mentioned helper can end-up freeing the socket wmem
    without waking-up any processes waiting for more write memory.
    
    If the partially orphaned skb is attached to an UDP (or raw) socket,
    the lack of wake-up can hang the user-space.
    
    Even for TCP sockets not calling the sk destructor could have bad
    effects on TSQ.
    
    Address the issue using skb_orphan to release the sk wmem before
    setting the new sock_efree destructor. Additionally bundle the
    whole ownership update in a new helper, so that later other
    potential users could avoid duplicate code.
    
    v1 -> v2:
     - use skb_orphan() instead of sort of open coding it (Eric)
     - provide an helper for the ownership change (Eric)

    net-ipv6: bugfix - raw & sctp - switch to ipv6_can_nonlocal_bind()
    
    commit 630e4576f83accf90366686f39808d665d8dbecc upstream.
    
    Found by virtue of ipv6 raw sockets not honouring the per-socket
    IP{,V6}_FREEBIND setting.
    
    Based on hits found via:
      git grep '[.]ip_nonlocal_bind'
    We fix both raw ipv6 sockets to honour IP{,V6}_FREEBIND and IP{,V6}_TRANSPARENT,
    and we fix sctp sockets to honour IP{,V6}_TRANSPARENT (they already honoured
    FREEBIND), and not just the ipv6 'ip_nonlocal_bind' sysctl.
    
    The helper is defined as:
      static inline bool ipv6_can_nonlocal_bind(struct net *net, struct inet_sock *inet) {
        return net->ipv6.sysctl.ip_nonlocal_bind || inet->freebind || inet->transparent;
      }
    so this change only widens the accepted opt-outs and is thus a clean bugfix.
    
    I'm not entirely sure what 'fixes' tag to add, since this is AFAICT an ancient bug,
    but IMHO this should be applied to stable kernels as far back as possible.
    As such I'm adding a 'fixes' tag with the commit that originally added the helper,
    which happened in 4.19.  Backporting to older LTS kernels (at least 4.9 and 4.14)
    would presumably require open-coding it or backporting the helper as well.

      v4.18-rc6-1502-g83ba4645152d net: add helpers checking if socket can be bound to nonlocal address

    net: hsr: Reset MAC header for Tx path
    
    commit 9d6803921a16f4d768dc41a75375629828f4d91e upstream.
    
    Reset MAC header in HSR Tx path. This is needed, because direct packet
    transmission, e.g. by specifying PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS does not reset the MAC
    header.
    
    This has been observed using the following setup:
    
    |$ ip link add name hsr0 type hsr slave1 lan0 slave2 lan1 supervision 45 version 1
    |$ ifconfig hsr0 up
    |$ ./test hsr0
    
    The test binary is using mmap'ed sockets and is specifying the
    PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS socket option.
    
    This patch resolves the following warning on a non-patched kernel:
    
    |[  112.725394] ------------[ cut here ]------------
    |[  112.731418] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 257 at net/hsr/hsr_forward.c:560 hsr_forward_skb+0x484/0x568
    |[  112.739962] net/hsr/hsr_forward.c:560: Malformed frame (port_src hsr0)
    
    The warning can be safely removed, because the other call sites of
    hsr_forward_skb() make sure that the skb is prepared correctly.

    mac80211: fix TXQ AC confusion
    
    commit 1153a74768a9212daadbb50767aa400bc6a0c9b0 upstream.
    
    Normally, TXQs have
    
      txq->tid = tid;
      txq->ac = ieee80211_ac_from_tid(tid);
    
    However, the special management TXQ actually has
    
      txq->tid = IEEE80211_NUM_TIDS; // 16
      txq->ac = IEEE80211_AC_VO;
    
    This makes sense, but ieee80211_ac_from_tid(16) is the same
    as ieee80211_ac_from_tid(0) which is just IEEE80211_AC_BE.
    
    Now, normally this is fine. However, if the netdev queues
    were stopped, then the code in ieee80211_tx_dequeue() will
    propagate the stop from the interface (vif->txqs_stopped[])
    if the AC 2 (ieee80211_ac_from_tid(txq->tid)) is marked as
    stopped. On wake, however, __ieee80211_wake_txqs() will wake
    the TXQ if AC 0 (txq->ac) is woken up.
    
    If a driver stops all queues with ieee80211_stop_tx_queues()
    and then wakes them again with ieee80211_wake_tx_queues(),
    the ieee80211_wake_txqs() tasklet will run to resync queue
    and TXQ state. If all queues were woken, then what'll happen
    is that _ieee80211_wake_txqs() will run in order of HW queues
    0-3, typically (and certainly for iwlwifi) corresponding to
    ACs 0-3, so it'll call __ieee80211_wake_txqs() for each AC in
    order 0-3.
    
    When __ieee80211_wake_txqs() is called for AC 0 (VO) that'll
    wake up the management TXQ (remember its tid is 16), and the
    driver's wake_tx_queue() will be called. That tries to get a
    frame, which will immediately *stop* the TXQ again, because
    now we check against AC 2, and AC 2 hasn't yet been marked as
    woken up again in sdata->vif.txqs_stopped[] since we're only
    in the __ieee80211_wake_txqs() call for AC 0.
    
    Thus, the management TXQ will never be started again.
    
    Fix this by checking txq->ac directly instead of calculating
    the AC as ieee80211_ac_from_tid(txq->tid).

    commit 7d73cd946d4bc7d44cdc5121b1c61d5d71425dea upstream.
    
    The incorrect timeout check caused probing to happen when it did
    not need to happen.  This in turn caused tx performance drop
    for around 5 seconds in ath10k-ct driver.  Possibly that tx drop
    is due to a secondary issue, but fixing the probe to not happen

    nl80211: fix beacon head validation
    
    commit 9a6847ba1747858ccac53c5aba3e25c54fbdf846 upstream.
    
    If the beacon head attribute (NL80211_ATTR_BEACON_HEAD)
    is too short to even contain the frame control field,
    we access uninitialized data beyond the buffer. Fix this
    by checking the minimal required size first. We used to
    do this until S1G support was added, where the fixed
    data portion has a different size.

    net: sched: fix action overwrite reference counting
    
    commit 87c750e8c38bce706eb32e4d8f1e3402f2cebbd4 upstream.
    
    Action init code increments reference counter when it changes an action.
    This is the desired behavior for cls API which needs to obtain action
    reference for every classifier that points to action. However, act API just
    needs to change the action and releases the reference before returning.
    This sequence breaks when the requested action doesn't exist, which causes
    act API init code to create new action with specified index, but action is
    still released before returning and is deleted (unless it was referenced
    concurrently by cls API).
    
    Reproduction:
    
    $ sudo tc actions ls action gact
    $ sudo tc actions change action gact drop index 1
    $ sudo tc actions ls action gact
    
    Extend tcf_action_init() to accept 'init_res' array and initialize it with
    action->ops->init() result. In tcf_action_add() remove pointers to created
    actions from actions array before passing it to tcf_action_put_many().

    Null pointer dereference happens on master->slaves dereference in
    teql_destroy() as master is null-pointer.
    
    When qdisc_create() calls teql_qdisc_init() it imediately fails after
    check "if (m->dev == dev)" because both devices are teql0, and it does
    not set qdisc_priv(sch)->m leaving it zero on error path, then
    qdisc_create() imediately calls teql_destroy() which does not expect
    zero master pointer and we get OOPS.

    vdpa/mlx5: Fix suspend/resume index restoration
    
    commit bc04d93ea30a0a8eb2a2648b848cef35d1f6f798 upstream.
    
    When we suspend the VM, the VDPA interface will be reset. When the VM is
    resumed again, clear_virtqueues() will clear the available and used
    indices resulting in hardware virqtqueue objects becoming out of sync.
    We can avoid this function alltogether since qemu will clear them if
    required, e.g. when the VM went through a reboot.
    
    Moreover, since the hw available and used indices should always be
    identical on query and should be restored to the same value same value
    for virtqueues that complete in order, we set the single value provided
    by set_vq_state(). In get_vq_state() we return the value of hardware
    used index.

    commit 12738ac4754ec92a6a45bf3677d8da780a1412b3 upstream.
    
    Remove error handling through pointers. Instead use plain int
    to return value from i40e_run_xdp(...).
    
    Previously:
    - sparse errors were produced during compilation:
    i40e_txrx.c:2338 i40e_run_xdp() error: (-2147483647) too low for ERR_PTR
    i40e_txrx.c:2558 i40e_clean_rx_irq() error: 'skb' dereferencing possible ERR_PTR()
    
    - sk_buff* was used to return value, but it has never had valid
    pointer to sk_buff. Returned value was always int handled as
    a pointer.

    net: ensure mac header is set in virtio_net_hdr_to_skb()
    
    commit 61431a5907fc36d0738e9a547c7e1556349a03e9 upstream.
    
    Commit 924a9bc362a5 ("net: check if protocol extracted by virtio_net_hdr_set_proto is correct")
    added a call to dev_parse_header_protocol() but mac_header is not yet set.
    
    This means that eth_hdr() reads complete garbage, and syzbot complained about it [1]
    
    This patch resets mac_header earlier, to get more coverage about this change.
    
    Audit of virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() callers shows that this change should be safe.

    bpf, sockmap: Fix incorrect fwd_alloc accounting
    
    commit 144748eb0c445091466c9b741ebd0bfcc5914f3d upstream.
    
    Incorrect accounting fwd_alloc can result in a warning when the socket
    is torn down,

    This currently happens because on redirect case we do skb_set_owner_r()
    with the original sock. This increments the fwd_alloc memory accounting
    on the original sock. Then on redirect we may push this into the queue
    of the psock we are redirecting to. When the skb is flushed from the
    queue we give the memory back to the original sock. The problem is if
    the original sock is destroyed/closed with skbs on another psocks queue
    then the original sock will not have a way to reclaim the memory before
    being destroyed. Then above warning will be thrown

             sk_psock_zap_ingress()
    
    At this point we have torn down our own psock, but have the outstanding
    skb in psock_other. Note that SK_PASS doesn't have this problem because
    the sk_psock_drop() logic releases the skb, its still associated with
    our psock.
    
    To resolve lets only account for sockets on the ingress queue that are
    still associated with the current socket. On the redirect case we will
    check memory limits per 6fa9201a89898, but will omit fwd_alloc accounting
    until skb is actually enqueued. When the skb is sent via skb_send_sock_locked
    or received with sk_psock_skb_ingress memory will be claimed on psock_other.

    bpf, sockmap: Fix sk->prot unhash op reset
    
    commit 1c84b33101c82683dee8b06761ca1f69e78c8ee7 upstream.
    
    In '4da6a196f93b1' we fixed a potential unhash loop caused when
    a TLS socket in a sockmap was removed from the sockmap. This
    happened because the unhash operation on the TLS ctx continued
    to point at the sockmap implementation of unhash even though the
    psock has already been removed. The sockmap unhash handler when a
    psock is removed does the following,
    
     void sock_map_unhash(struct sock *sk)
     {
            void (*saved_unhash)(struct sock *sk);
            struct sk_psock *psock;
    
            rcu_read_lock();
            psock = sk_psock(sk);
            if (unlikely(!psock)) {
                    rcu_read_unlock();
                    if (sk->sk_prot->unhash)
                            sk->sk_prot->unhash(sk);
                    return;
            }
            [...]
     }
    
    The unlikely() case is there to handle the case where psock is detached
    but the proto ops have not been updated yet. But, in the above case
    with TLS and removed psock we never fixed sk_prot->unhash() and unhash()
    points back to sock_map_unhash resulting in a loop. To fix this we added
    this bit of code,
    
     static inline void sk_psock_restore_proto(struct sock *sk,
                                              struct sk_psock *psock)
     {
           sk->sk_prot->unhash = psock->saved_unhash;
    
    This will set the sk_prot->unhash back to its saved value. This is the
    correct callback for a TLS socket that has been removed from the sock_map.
    Unfortunately, this also overwrites the unhash pointer for all psocks.
    We effectively break sockmap unhash handling for any future socks.
    Omitting the unhash operation will leave stale entries in the map if
    a socket transition through unhash, but does not do close() op.
    
    To fix set unhash correctly before calling into tls_update. This way the
    TLS enabled socket will point to the saved unhash() handler.

    bpf: Refcount task stack in bpf_get_task_stack
    
    commit 06ab134ce8ecfa5a69e850f88f81c8a4c3fa91df upstream.
    
    On x86 the struct pt_regs * grabbed by task_pt_regs() points to an
    offset of task->stack. The pt_regs are later dereferenced in
    __bpf_get_stack (e.g. by user_mode() check). This can cause a fault if
    the task in question exits while bpf_get_task_stack is executing, as
    warned by task_stack_page's comment:
    
    * When accessing the stack of a non-current task that might exit, use
    * try_get_task_stack() instead.  task_stack_page will return a pointer
    * that could get freed out from under you.
    
    Taking the comment's advice and using try_get_task_stack() and
    put_task_stack() to hold task->stack refcount, or bail early if it's
    already 0. Incrementing stack_refcount will ensure the task's stack
    sticks around while we're using its data.
    
    I noticed this bug while testing a bpf task iter similar to
    bpf_iter_task_stack in selftests, except mine grabbed user stack, and
    getting intermittent crashes, which resulted in dumps like:

    libbpf: Only create rx and tx XDP rings when necessary
    
    commit ca7a83e2487ad0bc9a3e0e7a8645354aa1782f13 upstream.
    
    Prior to this commit xsk_socket__create(_shared) always attempted to create
    the rx and tx rings for the socket. However this causes an issue when the
    socket being setup is that which shares the fd with the UMEM. If a
    previous call to this function failed with this socket after the rings were
    set up, a subsequent call would always fail because the rings are not torn
    down after the first call and when we try to set them up again we encounter
    an error because they already exist. Solve this by remembering whether the
    rings were set up by introducing new bools to struct xsk_umem which
    represent the ring setup status and using them to determine whether or
    not to set up the rings.

    commit 43f1bc1efff16f553dd573d02eb7a15750925568 upstream.
    
    If the call to xsk_socket__create fails, the user may want to retry the
    socket creation using the same umem. Ensure that the umem is in the
    same state on exit if the call fails by:
    1. ensuring the umem _save pointers are unmodified.
    2. not unmapping the set of umem rings that were set up with the umem
    during xsk_umem__create, since those maps existed before the call to
    xsk_socket__create and should remain in tact even in the event of
    failure.

    bpf: link: Refuse non-O_RDWR flags in BPF_OBJ_GET
    
    commit 25fc94b2f02d832fa8e29419699dcc20b0b05c6a upstream.
    
    Invoking BPF_OBJ_GET on a pinned bpf_link checks the path access
    permissions based on file_flags, but the returned fd ignores flags.
    This means that any user can acquire a "read-write" fd for a pinned
    link with mode 0664 by invoking BPF_OBJ_GET with BPF_F_RDONLY in
    file_flags. The fd can be used to invoke BPF_LINK_DETACH, etc.
    
    Fix this by refusing non-O_RDWR flags in BPF_OBJ_GET. This works
    because OBJ_GET by default returns a read write mapping and libbpf
    doesn't expose a way to override this behaviour for programs
    and links.

    bpf: Enforce that struct_ops programs be GPL-only
    
    commit 12aa8a9467b354ef893ce0fc5719a4de4949a9fb upstream.
    
    With the introduction of the struct_ops program type, it became possible to
    implement kernel functionality in BPF, making it viable to use BPF in place
    of a regular kernel module for these particular operations.
    
    Thus far, the only user of this mechanism is for implementing TCP
    congestion control algorithms. These are clearly marked as GPL-only when
    implemented as modules (as seen by the use of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL for
    tcp_register_congestion_control()), so it seems like an oversight that this
    was not carried over to BPF implementations. Since this is the only user
    of the struct_ops mechanism, just enforcing GPL-only for the struct_ops
    program type seems like the simplest way to fix this.

    net: hso: fix null-ptr-deref during tty device unregistration
    
    commit 8a12f8836145ffe37e9c8733dce18c22fb668b66 upstream.
    
    Multiple ttys try to claim the same the minor number causing a double
    unregistration of the same device. The first unregistration succeeds
    but the next one results in a null-ptr-deref.
    
    The get_free_serial_index() function returns an available minor number
    but doesn't assign it immediately. The assignment is done by the caller
    later. But before this assignment, calls to get_free_serial_index()
    would return the same minor number.
    
    Fix this by modifying get_free_serial_index to assign the minor number
    immediately after one is found to be and rename it to obtain_minor()
    to better reflect what it does. Similary, rename set_serial_by_index()
    to release_minor() and modify it to free up the minor number of the
    given hso_serial. Every obtain_minor() should have corresponding
    release_minor() call.

    commit 1831da7ea5bdf5531d78bcf81f526faa4c4375fa upstream.
    
    In ice_suspend(), ice_clear_interrupt_scheme() is called, and then
    irq_free_descs() will be eventually called to free irq and its descriptor.
    
    In ice_resume(), ice_init_interrupt_scheme() is called to allocate new
    irqs. However, in ice_rebuild_arfs(), struct irq_glue and struct cpu_rmap
    maybe cannot be freed, if the irqs that released in ice_suspend() were
    reassigned to other devices, which makes irq descriptor's affinity_notify
    lost.
    
    So call ice_free_cpu_rx_rmap() before ice_clear_interrupt_scheme(), which
    can make sure all irq_glue and cpu_rmap can be correctly released before
    corresponding irq and descriptor are released.
    
    Fix the following memory leak.

    iwlwifi: pcie: properly set LTR workarounds on 22000 devices
    
    commit 25628bc08d4526d3673ca7d039eb636aa9006076 upstream.
    
    As the context info gen3 code is only called for >=AX210 devices
    (from iwl_trans_pcie_gen2_start_fw()) the code there to set LTR
    on 22000 devices cannot actually do anything (22000 < AX210).
    
    Fix this by moving the LTR code to iwl_trans_pcie_gen2_start_fw()
    where it can handle both devices. This then requires that we kick
    the firmware only after that rather than doing it from the context
    info code.
    
    Note that this again had a dead branch in gen3 code, which I've
    removed here.

    ice: Cleanup fltr list in case of allocation issues
    
    commit b7eeb52721fe417730fc5adc5cbeeb5fe349ab26 upstream.
    
    When ice_remove_vsi_lkup_fltr is called, by calling
    ice_add_to_vsi_fltr_list local copy of vsi filter list
    is created. If any issues during creation of vsi filter
    list occurs it up for the caller to free already
    allocated memory. This patch ensures proper memory
    deallocation in these cases.

    commit 3176551979b92b02756979c0f1e2d03d1fc82b1e upstream.
    
    As per the spec, the WoL control word read from the NVM should be
    interpreted as port numbers, and not PF numbers. So when checking
    if WoL supported, use the port number instead of the PF ID.
    
    Also, ice_is_wol_supported doesn't really need a pointer to the pf
    struct, but just needs a pointer to the hw instance.

    ice: remove DCBNL_DEVRESET bit from PF state
    
    commit 741b7b743bbcb5a3848e4e55982064214f900d2f upstream.
    
    The original purpose of the ICE_DCBNL_DEVRESET was to protect
    the driver during DCBNL device resets.  But, the flow for
    DCBNL device resets now consists of only calls up the stack
    such as dev_close() and dev_open() that will result in NDO calls
    to the driver.  These will be handled with state changes from the
    stack.  Also, there is a problem of the dev_close and dev_open
    being blocked by checks for reset in progress also using the
    ICE_DCBNL_DEVRESET bit.
    
    Since the ICE_DCBNL_DEVRESET bit is not necessary for protecting
    the driver from DCBNL device resets and it is actually blocking
    changes coming from the DCBNL interface, remove the bit from the
    PF state and don't block driver function based on DCBNL reset in
    progress.

    ice: prevent ice_open and ice_stop during reset
    
    commit e95fc8573e07c5e4825df4650fd8b8c93fad27a7 upstream.
    
    There is a possibility of race between ice_open or ice_stop calls
    performed by OS and reset handling routine both trying to modify VSI
    resources. Observed scenarios:
    - reset handler deallocates memory in ice_vsi_free_arrays and ice_open
      tries to access it in ice_vsi_cfg_txq leading to driver crash
    - reset handler deallocates memory in ice_vsi_free_arrays and ice_close
      tries to access it in ice_down leading to driver crash
    - reset handler clears port scheduler topology and sets port state to
      ICE_SCHED_PORT_STATE_INIT leading to ice_ena_vsi_txq fail in ice_open
    
    To prevent this additional checks in ice_open and ice_stop are
    introduced to make sure that OS is not allowed to alter VSI config while
    reset is in progress.

    ARM: dts: turris-omnia: configure LED[2]/INTn pin as interrupt pin
    
    commit a26c56ae67fa9fbb45a8a232dcd7ebaa7af16086 upstream.
    
    Use the `marvell,reg-init` DT property to configure the LED[2]/INTn pin
    of the Marvell 88E1514 ethernet PHY on Turris Omnia into interrupt mode.
    
    Without this the pin is by default in LED[2] mode, and the Marvell PHY
    driver configures LED[2] into "On - Link, Blink - Activity" mode.
    
    This fixes the issue where the pca9538 GPIO/interrupt controller (which
    can't mask interrupts in HW) received too many interrupts and after a
    time started ignoring the interrupt with error message:
      IRQ 71: nobody cared
    
    There is a work in progress to have the Marvell PHY driver support
    parsing PHY LED nodes from OF and registering the LEDs as Linux LED
    class devices. Once this is done the PHY driver can also automatically
    set the pin into INTn mode if it does not find LED[2] in OF.
    
    Until then, though, we fix this via `marvell,reg-init` DT property.

    ethtool: fix incorrect datatype in set_eee ops
    
    commit 63cf32389925e234d166fb1a336b46de7f846003 upstream.
    
    The member 'tx_lpi_timer' is defined with __u32 datatype in the ethtool
    header file. Hence, we should use ethnl_update_u32() in set_eee ops.

    fs: direct-io: fix missing sdio->boundary
    
    commit df41872b68601059dd4a84858952dcae58acd331 upstream.
    
    I encountered a hung task issue, but not a performance one.  I run DIO
    on a device (need lba continuous, for example open channel ssd), maybe
    hungtask in below case:
    
      DIO:                                          Checkpoint:
      get addr A(at boundary), merge into BIO,
      no submit because boundary missing
                                                    flush dirty data(get addr A+1), wait IO(A+1)
                                                    writeback timeout, because DIO(A) didn't submit
      get addr A+2 fail, because checkpoint is doing
    
    dio_send_cur_page() may clear sdio->boundary, so prevent it from missing
    a boundary.

    ocfs2: fix deadlock between setattr and dio_end_io_write
    
    commit 90bd070aae6c4fb5d302f9c4b9c88be60c8197ec upstream.
    
    The following deadlock is detected:
    
      truncate -> setattr path is waiting for pending direct IO to be done (inode->i_dio_count become zero) with inode->i_rwsem held (down_write).
    
      PID: 14827  TASK: ffff881686a9af80  CPU: 20  COMMAND: "ora_p005_hrltd9"
       #0  __schedule at ffffffff818667cc
       #1  schedule at ffffffff81866de6
       #2  inode_dio_wait at ffffffff812a2d04
       #3  ocfs2_setattr at ffffffffc05f322e [ocfs2]
       #4  notify_change at ffffffff812a5a09
       #5  do_truncate at ffffffff812808f5
       #6  do_sys_ftruncate.constprop.18 at ffffffff81280cf2
       #7  sys_ftruncate at ffffffff81280d8e
       #8  do_syscall_64 at ffffffff81003949
       #9  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe at ffffffff81a001ad
    
    dio completion path is going to complete one direct IO (decrement
    inode->i_dio_count), but before that it hung at locking inode->i_rwsem:
    
       #0  __schedule+700 at ffffffff818667cc
       #1  schedule+54 at ffffffff81866de6
       #2  rwsem_down_write_failed+536 at ffffffff8186aa28
       #3  call_rwsem_down_write_failed+23 at ffffffff8185a1b7
       #4  down_write+45 at ffffffff81869c9d
       #5  ocfs2_dio_end_io_write+180 at ffffffffc05d5444 [ocfs2]
       #6  ocfs2_dio_end_io+85 at ffffffffc05d5a85 [ocfs2]
       #7  dio_complete+140 at ffffffff812c873c
       #8  dio_aio_complete_work+25 at ffffffff812c89f9
       #9  process_one_work+361 at ffffffff810b1889
      #10  worker_thread+77 at ffffffff810b233d
      #11  kthread+261 at ffffffff810b7fd5
      #12  ret_from_fork+62 at ffffffff81a0035e
    
    Thus above forms ABBA deadlock.  The same deadlock was mentioned in
    upstream commit 28f5a8a7c033 ("ocfs2: should wait dio before inode lock
    in ocfs2_setattr()").  It seems that that commit only removed the
    cluster lock (the victim of above dead lock) from the ABBA deadlock
    party.
    
    End-user visible effects: Process hang in truncate -> ocfs2_setattr path
    and other processes hang at ocfs2_dio_end_io_write path.
    
    This is to fix the deadlock itself.  It removes inode_lock() call from
    dio completion path to remove the deadlock and add ip_alloc_sem lock in
    setattr path to synchronize the inode modifications.

    nds32: flush_dcache_page: use page_mapping_file to avoid races with swapoff
    
    commit a3a8833dffb7e7329c2586b8bfc531adb503f123 upstream.
    
    Commit cb9f753a3731 ("mm: fix races between swapoff and flush dcache")
    updated flush_dcache_page implementations on several architectures to
    use page_mapping_file() in order to avoid races between page_mapping()
    and swapoff().
    
    This update missed arch/nds32 and there is a possibility of a race
    there.
    
    Replace page_mapping() with page_mapping_file() in nds32 implementation
    of flush_dcache_page().

    ia64: fix user_stack_pointer() for ptrace()
    
    commit 7ad1e366167837daeb93d0bacb57dee820b0b898 upstream.
    
    ia64 has two stacks:
    
     - memory stack (or stack), pointed at by by r12
    
     - register backing store (register stack), pointed at by
       ar.bsp/ar.bspstore with complications around dirty
       register frame on CPU.
    
    In [1] Dmitry noticed that PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO returns the register
    stack instead memory stack.
    
    The bug comes from the fact that user_stack_pointer() and
    current_user_stack_pointer() don't return the same register:
    
      ulong user_stack_pointer(struct pt_regs *regs) { return regs->ar_bspstore; }
      #define current_user_stack_pointer() (current_pt_regs()->r12)
    
    The change gets both back in sync.
    
    I think ptrace(PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO) is the only affected user by
    this bug on ia64.
    
    The change fixes 'rt_sigreturn.gen.test' strace test where it was
    observed initially.

    gcov: re-fix clang-11+ support
    
    commit 9562fd132985ea9185388a112e50f2a51557827d upstream.
    
    LLVM changed the expected function signature for llvm_gcda_emit_function()
    in the clang-11 release.  Users of clang-11 or newer may have noticed
    their kernels producing invalid coverage information:
    
      $ llvm-cov gcov -a -c -u -f -b <input>.gcda -- gcno=<input>.gcno
      1 <func>: checksum mismatch, \
        (<lineno chksum A>, <cfg chksum B>) != (<lineno chksum A>, <cfg chksum C>)
      2 Invalid .gcda File!
      ...
    
    Fix up the function signatures so calling this function interprets its
    parameters correctly and computes the correct cfg checksum.  In
    particular, in clang-11, the additional checksum is no longer optional.

    The issue happens when pcibus_to_node() returns NO_NUMA_NODE.
    
    Fix this issue by moving the initialization of dd->node to hfi1_devdata
    allocation and remove the other pcibus_to_node() calls in the probe path
    and use dd->node instead.
    
    Affinity logic is adjusted to use a new field dd->affinity_entry as a
    guard instead of dd->node.

    cifs: escape spaces in share names
    
    commit 0fc9322ab5e1fe6910c9673e1a7ff29f7dd72611 upstream.
    
    Commit 653a5efb849a ("cifs: update super_operations to show_devname")
    introduced the display of devname for cifs mounts. However, when mounting
    a share which has a whitespace in the name, that exact share name is also
    displayed in mountinfo. Make sure that all whitespace is escaped.

    rfkill: revert back to old userspace API by default
    
    commit 71826654ce40112f0651b6f4e94c422354f4adb6 upstream.
    
    Recompiling with the new extended version of struct rfkill_event
    broke systemd in *two* ways:
     - It used "sizeof(struct rfkill_event)" to read the event, but
       then complained if it actually got something != 8, this broke
       it on new kernels (that include the updated API);
     - It used sizeof(struct rfkill_event) to write a command, but
       didn't implement the intended expansion protocol where the
       kernel returns only how many bytes it accepted, and errored
       out due to the unexpected smaller size on kernels that didn't
       include the updated API.
    
    Even though systemd has now been fixed, that fix may not be always
    deployed, and other applications could potentially have similar
    issues.
    
    As such, in the interest of avoiding regressions, revert the
    default API "struct rfkill_event" back to the original size.
    
    Instead, add a new "struct rfkill_event_ext" that extends it by
    the new field, and even more clearly document that applications
    should be prepared for extensions in two ways:
     * write might only accept fewer bytes on older kernels, and
       will return how many to let userspace know which data may
       have been ignored;
     * read might return anything between 8 (the original size) and
       whatever size the application sized its buffer at, indicating
       how much event data was supported by the kernel.
    
    Perhaps that will help avoid such issues in the future and we
    won't have to come up with another version of the struct if we
    ever need to extend it again.
    
    Applications that want to take advantage of the new field will
    have to be modified to use struct rfkill_event_ext instead now,
    which comes with the danger of them having already been updated
    to use it from 'struct rfkill_event', but I found no evidence
    of that, and it's still relatively new.

    Commit 8cdddd182bd7 ("ACPI: processor: Fix CPU0 wakeup in

    into acpi_idle_play_dead(). The problem is that these functions are not

    The issue could've been fixed by exporting both wakeup_cpu0()/start_cpu0()

    new function and exporting it instead is better.

    net: dsa: lantiq_gswip: Configure all remaining GSWIP_MII_CFG bits
    
    commit 4b5923249b8fa427943b50b8f35265176472be38 upstream.
    
    There are a few more bits in the GSWIP_MII_CFG register for which we
    did rely on the boot-loader (or the hardware defaults) to set them up
    properly.
    
    For some external RMII PHYs we need to select the GSWIP_MII_CFG_RMII_CLK
    bit and also we should un-set it for non-RMII PHYs. The
    GSWIP_MII_CFG_RMII_CLK bit is ignored for other PHY connection modes.
    
    The GSWIP IP also supports in-band auto-negotiation for RGMII PHYs when
    the GSWIP_MII_CFG_RGMII_IBS bit is set. Clear this bit always as there's
    no known hardware which uses this (so it is not tested yet).
    
    Clear the xMII isolation bit when set at initialization time if it was
    previously set by the bootloader. Not doing so could lead to no traffic
    (neither RX nor TX) on a port with this bit set.
    
    While here, also add the GSWIP_MII_CFG_RESET bit. We don't need to
    manage it because this bit is self-clearning when set. We still add it
    here to get a better overview of the GSWIP_MII_CFG register.

    net: dsa: lantiq_gswip: Don't use PHY auto polling
    
    commit 3e9005be87777afc902b9f5497495898202d335d upstream.
    
    PHY auto polling on the GSWIP hardware can be used so link changes
    (speed, link up/down, etc.) can be detected automatically. Internally
    GSWIP reads the PHY's registers for this functionality. Based on this
    automatic detection GSWIP can also automatically re-configure it's port
    settings. Unfortunately this auto polling (and configuration) mechanism
    seems to cause various issues observed by different people on different
    devices:
    - FritzBox 7360v2: the two Gbit/s ports (connected to the two internal
      PHY11G instances) are working fine but the two Fast Ethernet ports
      (using an AR8030 RMII PHY) are completely dead (neither RX nor TX are
      received). It turns out that the AR8030 PHY sets the BMSR_ESTATEN bit
      as well as the ESTATUS_1000_TFULL and ESTATUS_1000_XFULL bits. This
      makes the PHY auto polling state machine (rightfully?) think that the
      established link speed (when the other side is Gbit/s capable) is
      1Gbit/s.
    - None of the Ethernet ports on the Zyxel P-2812HNU-F1 (two are
      connected to the internal PHY11G GPHYs while the other three are
      external RGMII PHYs) are working. Neither RX nor TX traffic was
      observed. It is not clear which part of the PHY auto polling state-
      machine caused this.
    - FritzBox 7412 (only one LAN port which is connected to one of the
      internal GPHYs running in PHY22F / Fast Ethernet mode) was seeing
      random disconnects (link down events could be seen). Sometimes all
      traffic would stop after such disconnect. It is not clear which part
      of the PHY auto polling state-machine cauased this.
    - TP-Link TD-W9980 (two ports are connected to the internal GPHYs
      running in PHY11G / Gbit/s mode, the other two are external RGMII
      PHYs) was affected by similar issues as the FritzBox 7412 just without
      the "link down" events
    
    Switch to software based configuration instead of PHY auto polling (and
    letting the GSWIP hardware configure the ports automatically) for the
    following link parameters:
    - link up/down
    - link speed
    - full/half duplex
    - flow control (RX / TX pause)
    
    After a big round of manual testing by various people (who helped test
    this on OpenWrt) it turns out that this fixes all reported issues.
    
    Additionally it can be considered more future proof because any
    "quirk" which is implemented for a PHY on the driver side can now be
    used with the GSWIP hardware as well because Linux is in control of the
    link parameters.
    
    As a nice side-effect this also solves a problem where fixed-links were
    not supported previously because we were relying on the PHY auto polling
    mechanism, which cannot work for fixed-links as there's no PHY from
    where it can read the registers. Configuring the link settings on the
    GSWIP ports means that we now use the settings from device-tree also for
    ports with fixed-links.

    commit 3e6fdeb28f4c331acbd27bdb0effc4befd4ef8e8 upstream.
    
    The xMII interface clock depends on the PHY interface (MII, RMII, RGMII)
    as well as the current link speed. Explicitly configure the GSWIP to
    automatically select the appropriate xMII interface clock.
    
    This fixes an issue seen by some users where ports using an external
    RMII or RGMII PHY were deaf (no RX or TX traffic could be seen). Most
    likely this is due to an "invalid" xMII clock being selected either by
    the bootloader or hardware-defaults.

    selinux: fix race between old and new sidtab
    
    commit 9ad6e9cb39c66366bf7b9aece114aca277981a1f upstream.
    
    Since commit 1b8b31a2e612 ("selinux: convert policy read-write lock to
    RCU"), there is a small window during policy load where the new policy
    pointer has already been installed, but some threads may still be
    holding the old policy pointer in their read-side RCU critical sections.
    This means that there may be conflicting attempts to add a new SID entry
    to both tables via sidtab_context_to_sid().
    
    See also (and the rest of the thread):
    https://lore.kernel.org/selinux/CAFqZXNvfux46_f8gnvVvRYMKoes24nwm2n3sPbMjrB8vKTW00g@mail.gmail.com/
    
    Fix this by installing the new policy pointer under the old sidtab's
    spinlock along with marking the old sidtab as "frozen". Then, if an
    attempt to add new entry to a "frozen" sidtab is detected, make
    sidtab_context_to_sid() return -ESTALE to indicate that a new policy
    has been installed and that the caller will have to abort the policy
    transaction and try again after re-taking the policy pointer (which is
    guaranteed to be a newer policy). This requires adding a retry-on-ESTALE
    logic to all callers of sidtab_context_to_sid(), but fortunately these
    are easy to determine and aren't that many.
    
    This seems to be the simplest solution for this problem, even if it
    looks somewhat ugly. Note that other places in the kernel (e.g.
    do_mknodat() in fs/namei.c) use similar stale-retry patterns, so I think
    it's reasonable.

    selinux: fix cond_list corruption when changing booleans
    
    commit d8f5f0ea5b86300390b026b6c6e7836b7150814a upstream.
    
    Currently, duplicate_policydb_cond_list() first copies the whole
    conditional avtab and then tries to link to the correct entries in
    cond_dup_av_list() using avtab_search(). However, since the conditional
    avtab may contain multiple entries with the same key, this approach
    often fails to find the right entry, potentially leading to wrong rules
    being activated/deactivated when booleans are changed.
    
    To fix this, instead start with an empty conditional avtab and add the
    individual entries one-by-one while building the new av_lists. This
    approach leads to the correct result, since each entry is present in the
    av_lists exactly once.
    
    The issue can be reproduced with Fedora policy as follows:
    
        # sesearch -s ftpd_t -t public_content_rw_t -c dir -p create -A
        allow ftpd_t non_security_file_type:dir { add_name create getattr ioctl link lock open read remove_name rename reparent rmdir search setattr unlink watch watch_reads write }; [ ftpd_full_access ]:True

        # setsebool ftpd_anon_write=off ftpd_connect_all_unreserved=off ftpd_connect_db=off ftpd_full_access=off
    
    On fixed kernels, the sesearch output is the same after the setsebool
    command:
    
        # sesearch -s ftpd_t -t public_content_rw_t -c dir -p create -A
        allow ftpd_t non_security_file_type:dir { add_name create getattr ioctl link lock open read remove_name rename reparent rmdir search setattr unlink watch watch_reads write }; [ ftpd_full_access ]:True
        allow ftpd_t public_content_rw_t:dir { add_name create link remove_name rename reparent rmdir setattr unlink watch watch_reads write }; [ ftpd_anon_write ]:True
    
    While on the broken kernels, it will be different:
    
        # sesearch -s ftpd_t -t public_content_rw_t -c dir -p create -A
        allow ftpd_t non_security_file_type:dir { add_name create getattr ioctl link lock open read remove_name rename reparent rmdir search setattr unlink watch watch_reads write }; [ ftpd_full_access ]:True
        allow ftpd_t non_security_file_type:dir { add_name create getattr ioctl link lock open read remove_name rename reparent rmdir search setattr unlink watch watch_reads write }; [ ftpd_full_access ]:True
        allow ftpd_t non_security_file_type:dir { add_name create getattr ioctl link lock open read remove_name rename reparent rmdir search setattr unlink watch watch_reads write }; [ ftpd_full_access ]:True
    
    While there, also simplify the computation of nslots. This changes the
    nslots values for nrules 2 or 3 to just two slots instead of 4, which
    makes the sequence more consistent.

    1. Make sure all fileds are initialized in avtab_init().
    2. Slightly refactor avtab_alloc() to use the above fact.
    3. Use h->nslot == 0 as a sentinel in the access functions to prevent
       dereferencing h->htable when it's not allocated.

    nfc: Avoid endless loops caused by repeated llcp_sock_connect()
    
    commit 4b5db93e7f2afbdfe3b78e37879a85290187e6f1 upstream.
    
    When sock_wait_state() returns -EINPROGRESS, "sk->sk_state" is
     LLCP_CONNECTING. In this case, llcp_sock_connect() is repeatedly invoked,
     nfc_llcp_sock_link() will add sk to local->connecting_sockets twice.
     sk->sk_node->next will point to itself, that will make an endless loop
     and hang-up the system.
    To fix it, check whether sk->sk_state is LLCP_CONNECTING in
     llcp_sock_connect() to avoid repeated invoking.

    ASoC: intel: atom: Stop advertising non working S24LE support
    
    commit aa65bacdb70e549a81de03ec72338e1047842883 upstream.
    
    The SST firmware's media and deep-buffer inputs are hardcoded to
    S16LE, the corresponding DAIs don't have a hw_params callback and
    their prepare callback also does not take the format into account.
    
    So far the advertising of non working S24LE support has not caused
    issues because pulseaudio defaults to S16LE, but changing pulse-audio's
    config to use S24LE will result in broken sound.
    
    Pipewire is replacing pulse now and pipewire prefers S24LE over S16LE
    when available, causing the problem of the broken S24LE support to
    come to the surface now.

    file: fix close_range() for unshare+cloexec
    
    commit 9b5b872215fe6d1ca6a1ef411f130bd58e269012 upstream.
    
    syzbot reported a bug when putting the last reference to a tasks file
    descriptor table. Debugging this showed we didn't recalculate the
    current maximum fd number for CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE | CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC
    after we unshared the file descriptors table. So max_fd could exceed the
    current fdtable maximum causing us to set excessive bits. As a concrete
    example, let's say the user requested everything from fd 4 to ~0UL to be
    closed and their current fdtable size is 256 with their highest open fd
    being 4. With CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE the caller will end up with a new
    fdtable which has room for 64 file descriptors since that is the lowest
    fdtable size we accept. But now max_fd will still point to 255 and needs
    to be adjusted. Fix this by retrieving the correct maximum fd value in
    __range_cloexec().

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix speaker amp setup on Acer Aspire E1
    
    commit c8426b2700b57d2760ff335840a02f66a64b6044 upstream.
    
    We've got a report about Acer Aspire E1 (PCI SSID 1025:0840) that
    loses the speaker output after resume.  With the comparison of COEF
    dumps, it was identified that the COEF 0x0d bits 0x6000 corresponds to
    the speaker amp.
    
    This patch adds the specific quirk for the device to restore the COEF
    bits at the codec (re-)initialization.

    commit ef19e111337f6c3dca7019a8bad5fbc6fb18d635 upstream.
    
    Replace WARN_ONCE() that can be triggered from userspace with

    I've left WARN()s that are not possible to trigger with current
    code-base and that would mean that the code has issues:
    - relying on current compat_msg_min[type] <= xfrm_msg_min[type]
    - expected 4-byte padding size difference between
      compat_msg_min[type] and xfrm_msg_min[type]
    - compat_policy[type].len <= xfrma_policy[type].len
    (for every type)
