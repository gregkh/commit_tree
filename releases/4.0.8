    ufs: Fix possible deadlock when looking up directories
    
    commit 514d748f69c97a51a2645eb198ac5c6218f22ff9 upstream.
    
    Commit e4502c63f56aeca88 (ufs: deal with nfsd/iget races) made ufs
    create inodes with I_NEW flag set. However ufs_mkdir() never cleared
    this flag. Thus if someone ever tried to lookup the directory by inode
    number, he would deadlock waiting for I_NEW to be cleared. Luckily this
    mostly happens only if the filesystem is exported over NFS since
    otherwise we have the inode attached to dentry and don't look it up by
    inode number. In rare cases dentry can get freed without inode being
    freed and then we'd hit the deadlock even without NFS export.
    
    Fix the problem by clearing I_NEW before instantiating new directory
    inode.

    ufs: Fix warning from unlock_new_inode()
    
    commit 12ecbb4b1d765a5076920999298d9625439dbe58 upstream.
    
    Commit e4502c63f56aeca88 (ufs: deal with nfsd/iget races) introduced
    unlock_new_inode() call into ufs_add_nondir(). However that function
    gets called also from ufs_link() which hands it already initialized
    inode and thus unlock_new_inode() complains. The problem is harmless but
    annoying.
    
    Fix the problem by opencoding necessary stuff in ufs_link()

    vfs: Remove incorrect debugging WARN in prepend_path
    
    commit 93e3bce6287e1fb3e60d3324ed08555b5bbafa89 upstream.
    
    The warning message in prepend_path is unclear and outdated.  It was
    added as a warning that the mechanism for generating names of pseudo
    files had been removed from prepend_path and d_dname should be used
    instead.  Unfortunately the warning reads like a general warning,
    making it unclear what to do with it.
    
    Remove the warning.  The transition it was added to warn about is long
    over, and I added code several years ago which in rare cases causes
    the warning to fire on legitimate code, and the warning is now firing
    and scaring people for no good reason.

    KVM: s390: virtio-ccw: don't overwrite config space values
    
    commit 431dae778aea4eed31bd12e5ee82edc571cd4d70 upstream.
    
    Eric noticed problems with vhost-scsi and virtio-ccw: vhost-scsi
    complained about overwriting values in the config space, which
    was triggered by a broken implementation of virtio-ccw's config
    get/set routines. It was probably sheer luck that we did not hit
    this before.
    
    When writing a value to the config space, the WRITE_CONF ccw will
    always write from the beginning of the config space up to and
    including the value to be set. If the config space up to the value
    has not yet been retrieved from the device, however, we'll end up
    overwriting values. Keep track of the known config space and update
    if needed to avoid this.
    
    Moreover, READ_CONF will only read the number of bytes it has been
    instructed to retrieve, so we must not copy more than that to the
    buffer, or we might overwrite trailing values.

    KVM: s390: fix external call injection without sigp interpretation
    
    commit b938eacea0b6881f2116a061e6da3ec840e75137 upstream.
    
    Commit ea5f49692575 ("KVM: s390: only one external call may be pending
    at a time") introduced a bug on machines that don't have SIGP
    interpretation facility installed.
    The injection of an external call will now always fail with -EBUSY
    (if none is already pending).
    
    This leads to the following symptoms:
    - An external call will be injected but with the wrong "src cpu id",
      as this id will not be remembered.
    - The target vcpu will not be woken up, therefore the guest will hang if
      it cannot deal with unexpected failures of the SIGP EXTERNAL CALL
      instruction.
    - If an external call is already pending, -EBUSY will not be reported.

    x86/PCI: Use host bridge _CRS info on Foxconn K8M890-8237A

    resources correctly without the information from _CRS that tells us which
    address ranges are claimed by which bridge.  In the bugs mentioned below,
    we incorrectly assign a sound card address (this example is from 1033299):

    x86/PCI: Use host bridge _CRS info on systems with >32 bit addressing
    
    commit 3d9fecf6bfb8b12bc2f9a4c7109895a2a2bb9436 upstream.
    
    We enable _CRS on all systems from 2008 and later.  On older systems, we
    ignore _CRS and assume the whole physical address space (excluding RAM and
    other devices) is available for PCI devices, but on systems that support
    physical address spaces larger than 4GB, it's doubtful that the area above
    4GB is really available for PCI.
    
    After d56dbf5bab8c ("PCI: Allocate 64-bit BARs above 4G when possible"), we
    try to use that space above 4GB *first*, so we're more likely to put a
    device there.
    
    On Juan's Toshiba Satellite Pro U200, BIOS left the graphics, sound, 1394,
    and card reader devices unassigned (but only after Windows had been
    booted).  Only the sound device had a 64-bit BAR, so it was the only device
    placed above 4GB, and hence the only device that didn't work.
    
    Keep _CRS enabled even on pre-2008 systems if they support physical address
    space larger than 4GB.

    powerpc/perf: Fix book3s kernel to userspace backtraces
    
    commit 72e349f1124a114435e599479c9b8d14bfd1ebcd upstream.
    
    When we take a PMU exception or a software event we call
    perf_read_regs(). This overloads regs->result with a boolean that
    describes if we should use the sampled instruction address register
    (SIAR) or the regs.
    
    If the exception is in kernel, we start with the kernel regs and
    backtrace through the kernel stack. At this point we switch to the
    userspace regs and backtrace the user stack with perf_callchain_user().
    
    Unfortunately these regs have not got the perf_read_regs() treatment,
    so regs->result could be anything. If it is non zero,

    tick/idle/powerpc: Do not register idle states with CPUIDLE_FLAG_TIMER_STOP set in periodic mode
    
    commit cc5a2f7b8f39e7db559778f7913a2410257b3e50 upstream.
    
    On some archs, the local clockevent device stops in deep cpuidle states.
    The broadcast framework is used to wakeup cpus in these idle states, in
    which either an external clockevent device is used to send wakeup ipis
    or the hrtimer broadcast framework kicks in in the absence of such a
    device. One cpu is nominated as the broadcast cpu and this cpu sends
    wakeup ipis to sleeping cpus at the appropriate time. This is the
    implementation in the oneshot mode of broadcast.
    
    In periodic mode of broadcast however, the presence of such cpuidle
    states results in the cpuidle driver calling tick_broadcast_enable()
    which shuts down the local clockevent devices of all the cpus and
    appoints the tick broadcast device as the clockevent device for each of
    them. This works on those archs where the tick broadcast device is a
    real clockevent device.  But on archs which depend on the hrtimer mode
    of broadcast, the tick broadcast device hapens to be a pseudo device.
    The consequence is that the local clockevent devices of all cpus are
    shutdown and the kernel hangs at boot time in periodic mode.
    
    Let us thus not register the cpuidle states which have
    CPUIDLE_FLAG_TIMER_STOP flag set, on archs which depend on the hrtimer
    mode of broadcast in periodic mode. This patch takes care of doing this
    on powerpc. The cpus would not have entered into such deep cpuidle
    states in periodic mode on powerpc anyway. So there is no loss here.

    ARM: mvebu: fix suspend to RAM on big-endian configurations
    
    commit 2f5bc307be2480ba89e4c5d118f406f04a4a7299 upstream.
    
    The current Armada XP suspend to RAM implementation, as added in
    commit 27432825ae19f ("ARM: mvebu: Armada XP GP specific
    suspend/resume code") does not handle big-endian configurations
    properly: the small bit of assembly code putting the DRAM in
    self-refresh and toggling the GPIOs to turn off power forgets to
    convert the values to little-endian.
    
    This commit fixes that by making sure the two values we will write to
    the DRAM controller register and GPIO register are already in
    little-endian before entering the critical assembly code.

    ARM: tegra20: Store CPU "resettable" status in IRAM
    
    commit 4d48edb3c3e1234d6b3fcdfb9ac24d7c6de449cb upstream.
    
    Commit 7232398abc6a ("ARM: tegra: Convert PMC to a driver") changed tegra_resume()
    location storing from late to early and, as a result, broke suspend on Tegra20.
    PMC scratch register 41 is used by tegra LP1 resume code for retrieving stored
    physical memory address of common resume function and in the same time used by
    tegra20_cpu_shutdown() (shared by Tegra20 cpuidle driver and platform SMP code),
    which is storing CPU1 "resettable" status. It implies strict order of scratch
    register usage, otherwise resume function address is lost on Tegra20 after
    disabling non-boot CPU's on suspend. Fix it by storing "resettable" status in
    IRAM instead of PMC scratch register.

    ARM: kvm: psci: fix handling of unimplemented functions
    
    commit e2d997366dc5b6c9d14035867f73957f93e7578c upstream.
    
    According to the PSCI specification and the SMC/HVC calling
    convention, PSCI function_ids that are not implemented must
    return NOT_SUPPORTED as return value.
    
    Current KVM implementation takes an unhandled PSCI function_id
    as an error and injects an undefined instruction into the guest
    if PSCI implementation is called with a function_id that is not
    handled by the resident PSCI version (ie it is not implemented),
    which is not the behaviour expected by a guest when calling a
    PSCI function_id that is not implemented.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by returning NOT_SUPPORTED whenever
    the kvm PSCI call is executed for a function_id that is not
    implemented by the PSCI kvm layer.

    arm: KVM: force execution of HCPTR access on VM exit
    
    commit 85e84ba31039595995dae80b277378213602891b upstream.
    
    On VM entry, we disable access to the VFP registers in order to
    perform a lazy save/restore of these registers.
    
    On VM exit, we restore access, test if we did enable them before,
    and save/restore the guest/host registers if necessary. In this
    sequence, the FPEXC register is always accessed, irrespective
    of the trapping configuration.
    
    If the guest didn't touch the VFP registers, then the HCPTR access
    has now enabled such access, but we're missing a barrier to ensure
    architectural execution of the new HCPTR configuration. If the HCPTR
    access has been delayed/reordered, the subsequent access to FPEXC
    will cause a trap, which we aren't prepared to handle at all.
    
    The same condition exists when trapping to enable VFP for the guest.
    
    The fix is to introduce a barrier after enabling VFP access. In the
    vmexit case, it can be relaxed to only takes place if the guest hasn't
    accessed its view of the VFP registers, making the access to FPEXC safe.
    
    The set_hcptr macro is modified to deal with both vmenter/vmexit and
    vmtrap operations, and now takes an optional label that is branched to
    when the guest hasn't touched the VFP registers.

    selinux: fix setting of security labels on NFS
    
    commit 9fc2b4b436cff7d8403034676014f1be9d534942 upstream.
    
    Before calling into the filesystem, vfs_setxattr calls
    security_inode_setxattr, which ends up calling selinux_inode_setxattr in
    our case.  That returns -EOPNOTSUPP whenever SBLABEL_MNT is not set.
    SBLABEL_MNT was supposed to be set by sb_finish_set_opts, which sets it
    only if selinux_is_sblabel_mnt returns true.
    
    The selinux_is_sblabel_mnt logic was broken by eadcabc697e9 "SELinux: do
    all flags twiddling in one place", which didn't take into the account
    the SECURITY_FS_USE_NATIVE behavior that had been introduced for nfs
    with eb9ae686507b "SELinux: Add new labeling type native labels".
    
    This caused setxattr's of security labels over NFSv4.2 to fail.

    mmc: sdhci: fix low memory corruption
    
    commit 62a7f368ffbc13d9aedfdd7aeae711b177db69ac upstream.
    
    When dma mapping (dma_map_sg) fails in sdhci_pre_dma_transfer, -EINVAL
    is returned. There are 3 callers of sdhci_pre_dma_transfer:
    * sdhci_pre_req and sdhci_adma_table_pre: handle negative return
    * sdhci_prepare_data: handles 0 (error) and "else" (good) only
    
    sdhci_prepare_data is therefore broken. When it receives -EINVAL from
    sdhci_pre_dma_transfer, it assumes 1 sg mapping was mapped. Later,
    this non-existent mapping with address 0 is kmap'ped and written to:
    Corrupted low memory at ffff880000001000 (1000 phys) = 22b7d67df2f6d1cf
    Corrupted low memory at ffff880000001008 (1008 phys) = 63848a5216b7dd95
    Corrupted low memory at ffff880000001010 (1010 phys) = 330eb7ddef39e427
    Corrupted low memory at ffff880000001018 (1018 phys) = 8017ac7295039bda
    Corrupted low memory at ffff880000001020 (1020 phys) = 8ce039eac119074f
    ...
    
    So teach sdhci_prepare_data to understand negative return values from
    sdhci_pre_dma_transfer and disable DMA in that case, as well as for
    zero.
    
    It was introduced in 348487cb28e66b032bae1b38424d81bf5b444408 (mmc:
    sdhci: use pipeline mmc requests to improve performance). The commit
    seems to be suspicious also by assigning host->sg_count both in
    sdhci_pre_dma_transfer and sdhci_adma_table_pre.

    commit 342f39a6c8d34d638a87b7d5f2156adc4db2585c upstream.
    
    when copying to iter the size can be different then the iov count,
    the check for full iov is wrong and make any read on request which
    is not the exactly size of iov to return -EFAULT.
    
    So, just check the success of the copy.

    net: mvneta: disable IP checksum with jumbo frames for Armada 370
    
    [ Upstream commit b65657fc240ae6c1d2a1e62db9a0e61ac9631d7a ]
    
    The Ethernet controller found in the Armada 370, 380 and 385 SoCs don't
    support TCP/IP checksumming with frame sizes larger than 1600 bytes.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by disabling the features NETIF_F_IP_CSUM and
    NETIF_F_TSO for the Armada 370 and compatibles SoCs when the MTU is set
    to a value greater than 1600 bytes.

    The mvneta driver supports the Ethernet IP found in the Armada 370, XP,
    380 and 385 SoCs. Since at least one more hardware feature is available
    for the Armada XP SoCs then a way to identify them is needed.

    amd-xgbe: Add the __GFP_NOWARN flag to Rx buffer allocation
    
    [ Upstream commit 472cfe7127760d68b819cf35a26e5a1b44b30f4e ]
    
    When allocating Rx related buffers, alloc_pages is called using an order
    number that is decreased until successful. A system under stress can
    experience failures during this allocation process resulting in a warning
    being issued. This message can be of concern to end users even though the
    failure is not fatal. Since the failure is not fatal and can occur
    multiple times, the driver should include the __GFP_NOWARN flag to
    suppress the warning message from being issued.

    sctp: Fix race between OOTB responce and route removal
    
    [ Upstream commit 29c4afc4e98f4dc0ea9df22c631841f9c220b944 ]
    
    There is NULL pointer dereference possible during statistics update if the route
    used for OOTB responce is removed at unfortunate time. If the route exists when
    we receive OOTB packet and we finally jump into sctp_packet_transmit() to send
    ABORT, but in the meantime route is removed under our feet, we take "no_route"
    path and try to update stats with IP_INC_STATS(sock_net(asoc->base.sk), ...).
    
    But sctp_ootb_pkt_new() used to prepare responce packet doesn't call
    sctp_transport_set_owner() and therefore there is no asoc associated with this
    packet. Probably temporary asoc just for OOTB responces is overkill, so just
    introduce a check like in all other places in sctp_packet_transmit(), where
    "asoc" is dereferenced.
    
    To reproduce this, one needs to
    0. ensure that sctp module is loaded (otherwise ABORT is not generated)
    1. remove default route on the machine
    2. while true; do
         ip route del [interface-specific route]
         ip route add [interface-specific route]
       done
    3. send enough OOTB packets (i.e. HB REQs) from another host to trigger ABORT
       responce
    
    On x86_64 the crash looks like this:

    When limiting phy link speed using "max-speed" to 100mbps or less on a
    giga bit phy, phy never completes auto negotiation and phy state
    machine is held in PHY_AN. Fixing this issue by comparing the giga
    bit advertise though phydev->supported doesn't have it but phy has
    BMSR_ESTATEN set. So that auto negotiation is restarted as old and
    new advertise are different and link comes up fine.

    mlx4: Disable HA for SRIOV PF RoCE devices
    
    [ Upstream commit 7254acffeeec3c0a75b9c5364c29a6eb00014930 ]
    
    When in HA mode, the driver exposes an IB (RoCE) device instance with only
    one port. Under SRIOV, the existing implementation doesn't go well with
    the PF RoCE driver's role of Special QPs Para-Virtualization, etc.
    
    As such, disable HA for the mlx4 PF RoCE device in SRIOV mode.

    net/mlx4_en: Fix wrong csum complete report when rxvlan offload is disabled
    
    [ Upstream commit 79a258526ce1051cb9684018c25a89d51ac21be8 ]
    
    The check_csum() function relied on hwtstamp_rx_filter to know if rxvlan
    offload is disabled. This is wrong since rxvlan offload can be switched
    on/off regardless of hwtstamp_rx_filter.
    
    Also moved check_csum to query CQE information to identify VLAN packets
    and removed the check of IP packets, since it has been validated before.

    net/mlx4_en: Wake TX queues only when there's enough room
    
    [ Upstream commit 488a9b48e398b157703766e2cd91ea45ac6997c5 ]
    
    Indication of a single completed packet, marked by txbbs_skipped
    being bigger then zero, in not enough in order to wake up a
    stopped TX queue. The completed packet may contain a single TXBB,
    while next packet to be sent (after the wake up) may have multiple
    TXBBs (LSO/TSO packets for example), causing overflow in queue followed
    by WQE corruption and TX queue timeout.
    Instead, wake the stopped queue only when there's enough room for the
    worst case (maximum sized WQE) packet that we should need to handle after
    the queue is opened again.
    
    Also created an helper routine - mlx4_en_is_tx_ring_full, which checks
    if the current TX ring is full or not. It provides better code readability
    and removes code duplication.

    tcp: Do not call tcp_fastopen_reset_cipher from interrupt context
    
    [ Upstream commit dfea2aa654243f70dc53b8648d0bbdeec55a7df1 ]
    
    tcp_fastopen_reset_cipher really cannot be called from interrupt
    context. It allocates the tcp_fastopen_context with GFP_KERNEL and
    calls crypto_alloc_cipher, which allocates all kind of stuff with
    GFP_KERNEL.
    
    Thus, we might sleep when the key-generation is triggered by an
    incoming TFO cookie-request which would then happen in interrupt-
    context, as shown by enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP:

    neigh: do not modify unlinked entries
    
    [ Upstream commit 2c51a97f76d20ebf1f50fef908b986cb051fdff9 ]
    
    The lockless lookups can return entry that is unlinked.
    Sometimes they get reference before last neigh_cleanup_and_release,
    sometimes they do not need reference. Later, any
    modification attempts may result in the following problems:
    
    1. entry is not destroyed immediately because neigh_update
    can start the timer for dead entry, eg. on change to NUD_REACHABLE
    state. As result, entry lives for some time but is invisible
    and out of control.
    
    2. __neigh_event_send can run in parallel with neigh_destroy
    while refcnt=0 but if timer is started and expired refcnt can
    reach 0 for second time leading to second neigh_destroy and
    possible crash.
    
    Thanks to Eric Dumazet and Ying Xue for their work and analyze
    on the __neigh_event_send change.

    [ Upstream commit 2dab80a8b486f02222a69daca6859519e05781d9 ]
    
    After the ->set() spinlocks were removed br_stp_set_bridge_priority
    was left running without any protection when used via sysfs. It can
    race with port add/del and could result in use-after-free cases and
    corrupted lists. Tested by running port add/del in a loop with stp
    enabled while setting priority in a loop, crashes are easily
    reproducible.

    sctp: fix ASCONF list handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d45a02d0166caf2627fe91897c6ffc3b19514c4 ]
    
    ->auto_asconf_splist is per namespace and mangled by functions like
    sctp_setsockopt_auto_asconf() which doesn't guarantee any serialization.
    
    Also, the call to inet_sk_copy_descendant() was backuping
    ->auto_asconf_list through the copy but was not honoring
    ->do_auto_asconf, which could lead to list corruption if it was
    different between both sockets.
    
    This commit thus fixes the list handling by using ->addr_wq_lock
    spinlock to protect the list. A special handling is done upon socket
    creation and destruction for that. Error handlig on sctp_init_sock()
    will never return an error after having initialized asconf, so
    sctp_destroy_sock() can be called without addrq_wq_lock. The lock now
    will be take on sctp_close_sock(), before locking the socket, so we
    don't do it in inverse order compared to sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler().
    
    Instead of taking the lock on sctp_sock_migrate() for copying and
    restoring the list values, it's preferred to avoid rewritting it by
    implementing sctp_copy_descendant().
    
    Issue was found with a test application that kept flipping sysctl
    default_auto_asconf on and off, but one could trigger it by issuing
    simultaneous setsockopt() calls on multiple sockets or by
    creating/destroying sockets fast enough. This is only triggerable
    locally.

    net: don't wait for order-3 page allocation
    
    [ Upstream commit fb05e7a89f500cfc06ae277bdc911b281928995d ]
    
    We saw excessive direct memory compaction triggered by skb_page_frag_refill.
    This causes performance issues and add latency. Commit 5640f7685831e0
    introduces the order-3 allocation. According to the changelog, the order-3
    allocation isn't a must-have but to improve performance. But direct memory
    compaction has high overhead. The benefit of order-3 allocation can't
    compensate the overhead of direct memory compaction.
    
    This patch makes the order-3 page allocation atomic. If there is no memory
    pressure and memory isn't fragmented, the alloction will still success, so we
    don't sacrifice the order-3 benefit here. If the atomic allocation fails,
    direct memory compaction will not be triggered, skb_page_frag_refill will
    fallback to order-0 immediately, hence the direct memory compaction overhead is
    avoided. In the allocation failure case, kswapd is waken up and doing
    compaction, so chances are allocation could success next time.
    
    alloc_skb_with_frags is the same.
    
    The mellanox driver does similar thing, if this is accepted, we must fix
    the driver too.
    
    V3: fix the same issue in alloc_skb_with_frags as pointed out by Eric
    V2: make the changelog clearer

    net: igb: fix the start time for periodic output signals
    
    [ Upstream commit 58c98be137830d34b79024cc5dc95ef54fcd7ffe ]
    
    When programming the start of a periodic output, the code wrongly places
    the seconds value into the "low" register and the nanoseconds into the
    "high" register.  Even though this is backwards, it slipped through my
    testing, because the re-arming code in the interrupt service routine is
    correct, and the signal does appear starting with the second edge.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by programming the registers correctly.

    bridge: fix multicast router rlist endless loop
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a040eaca1a22f8da8285ceda6b5e4a2cb704867 ]
    
    Since the addition of sysfs multicast router support if one set
    multicast_router to "2" more than once, then the port would be added to
    the hlist every time and could end up linking to itself and thus causing an
    endless loop for rlist walkers.
    So to reproduce just do:
    echo 2 > multicast_router; echo 2 > multicast_router;
    in a bridge port and let some igmp traffic flow, for me it hangs up
    in br_multicast_flood().
    Fix this by adding a check in br_multicast_add_router() if the port is
    already linked.
    The reason this didn't happen before the addition of multicast_router
    sysfs entries is because there's a !hlist_unhashed check that prevents
    it.

    KVM: nSVM: Check for NRIPS support before updating control field
    
    commit f104765b4f81fd74d69e0eb161e89096deade2db upstream.
    
    If hardware doesn't support DecodeAssist - a feature that provides
    more information about the intercept in the VMCB, KVM decodes the
    instruction and then updates the next_rip vmcb control field.
    However, NRIP support itself depends on cpuid Fn8000_000A_EDX[NRIPS].
    Since skip_emulated_instruction() doesn't verify nrip support
    before accepting control.next_rip as valid, avoid writing this
    field if support isn't present.

    config: Enable NEED_DMA_MAP_STATE by default when SWIOTLB is selected
    
    commit a6dfa128ce5c414ab46b1d690f7a1b8decb8526d upstream.
    
    A huge amount of NIC drivers use the DMA API, however if
    compiled under 32-bit an very important part of the DMA API can
    be ommitted leading to the drivers not working at all
    (especially if used with 'swiotlb=force iommu=soft').
    
    As Prashant Sreedharan explains it: "the driver [tg3] uses
    DEFINE_DMA_UNMAP_ADDR(), dma_unmap_addr_set() to keep a copy of
    the dma "mapping" and dma_unmap_addr() to get the "mapping"
    value. On most of the platforms this is a no-op, but ... with
    "iommu=soft and swiotlb=force" this house keeping is required,
    ... otherwise we pass 0 while calling pci_unmap_/pci_dma_sync_
    instead of the DMA address."
    
    As such enable this even when using 32-bit kernels.
