    commit a743bbeef27b9176987ec0cb7f906ab0ab52d1da upstream.
    
    The warning below says it all:

    rbd: use GFP_NOIO for parent stat and data requests
    
    commit 1e37f2f84680fa7f8394fd444b6928e334495ccc upstream.
    
    rbd_img_obj_exists_submit() and rbd_img_obj_parent_read_full() are on
    the writeback path for cloned images -- we attempt a stat on the parent
    object to see if it exists and potentially read it in to call copyup.
    GFP_NOIO should be used instead of GFP_KERNEL here.

    MIPS: Fix CM region target definitions
    
    commit 6a6cba1d945a7511cdfaf338526871195e420762 upstream.
    
    The default CM target field in the GCR_BASE register is encoded with 0
    meaning memory & 1 being reserved. However the definitions we use for
    those bits effectively get these two values backwards - likely because
    they were copied from the definitions for the CM regions where the
    target is encoded differently. This results in use setting up GCR_BASE
    with the reserved target value by default, rather than targeting memory
    as intended. Although we currently seem to get away with this it's not a
    great idea to rely upon.
    
    Fix this by changing our macros to match the documentated target values.
    
    The incorrect encoding became used as of commit 9f98f3dd0c51 ("MIPS: Add
    generic CM probe & access code") in the Linux v3.15 cycle, and was
    likely carried forwards from older but unused code introduced by
    commit 39b8d5254246 ("[MIPS] Add support for MIPS CMP platform.") in the
    v2.6.26 cycle.

    ALSA: seq: Avoid invalid lockdep class warning
    
    commit 3510c7aa069aa83a2de6dab2b41401a198317bdc upstream.
    
    The recent fix for adding rwsem nesting annotation was using the given
    "hop" argument as the lock subclass key.  Although the idea itself
    works, it may trigger a kernel warning like:
      BUG: looking up invalid subclass: 8
      ....
    since the lockdep has a smaller number of subclasses (8) than we
    currently allow for the hops there (10).
    
    The current definition is merely a sanity check for avoiding the too
    deep delivery paths, and the 8 hops are already enough.  So, as a
    quick fix, just follow the max hops as same as the max lockdep
    subclasses.

    ALSA: seq: Fix OSS sysex delivery in OSS emulation
    
    commit 132d358b183ac6ad8b3fea32ad5e0663456d18d1 upstream.
    
    The SYSEX event delivery in OSS sequencer emulation assumed that the
    event is encoded in the variable-length data with the straight
    buffering.  This was the normal behavior in the past, but during the
    development, the chained buffers were introduced for carrying more
    data, while the OSS code was left intact.  As a result, when a SYSEX
    event with the chained buffer data is passed to OSS sequencer port,
    it may end up with the wrong memory access, as if it were having a too
    large buffer.
    
    This patch addresses the bug, by applying the buffer data expansion by
    the generic snd_seq_dump_var_event() helper function.

    ARM: 8720/1: ensure dump_instr() checks addr_limit
    
    commit b9dd05c7002ee0ca8b676428b2268c26399b5e31 upstream.
    
    When CONFIG_DEBUG_USER is enabled, it's possible for a user to
    deliberately trigger dump_instr() with a chosen kernel address.
    
    Let's avoid problems resulting from this by using get_user() rather than
    __get_user(), ensuring that we don't erroneously access kernel memory.
    
    So that we can use the same code to dump user instructions and kernel
    instructions, the common dumping code is factored out to __dump_instr(),
    with the fs manipulated appropriately in dump_instr() around calls to
    this.

    KEYS: fix NULL pointer dereference during ASN.1 parsing [ver #2]
    
    commit 624f5ab8720b3371367327a822c267699c1823b8 upstream.
    
    syzkaller reported a NULL pointer dereference in asn1_ber_decoder().  It
    can be reproduced by the following command, assuming
    CONFIG_PKCS7_TEST_KEY=y:
    
            keyctl add pkcs7_test desc '' @s
    
    The bug is that if the data buffer is empty, an integer underflow occurs
    in the following check:
    
            if (unlikely(dp >= datalen - 1))
                    goto data_overrun_error;
    
    This results in the NULL data pointer being dereferenced.
    
    Fix it by checking for 'datalen - dp < 2' instead.
    
    Also fix the similar check for 'dp >= datalen - n' later in the same
    function.  That one possibly could result in a buffer overread.
    
    The NULL pointer dereference was reproducible using the "pkcs7_test" key
    type but not the "asymmetric" key type because the "asymmetric" key type
    checks for a 0-length payload before calling into the ASN.1 decoder but
    the "pkcs7_test" key type does not.
    
    The bug report was:
    
        BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at           (null)

    struct sha1_ctx_mgr allocated in sha1_mb_mod_init() via kzalloc()

    16-bytes aligned argument, but nothing guarantees that struct
    sha1_ctx_mgr will have that alignment. Unaligned vmovdqa will
    generate GP fault.
    
    Fix this by replacing vmovdqa with vmovdqu which doesn't have alignment
    requirements.

    KEYS: trusted: fix writing past end of buffer in trusted_read()
    
    commit a3c812f7cfd80cf51e8f5b7034f7418f6beb56c1 upstream.
    
    When calling keyctl_read() on a key of type "trusted", if the
    user-supplied buffer was too small, the kernel ignored the buffer length
    and just wrote past the end of the buffer, potentially corrupting
    userspace memory.  Fix it by instead returning the size required, as per
    the documentation for keyctl_read().
    
    We also don't even fill the buffer at all in this case, as this is
    slightly easier to implement than doing a short read, and either
    behavior appears to be permitted.  It also makes it match the behavior
    of the "encrypted" key type.

    is freed.  Notably, we were not zeroing the tpm_buf structures in which
    the actual key is stored for TPM seal and unseal, nor were we zeroing
    the trusted_key_payload in certain error paths.

    IB/ipoib: Change list_del to list_del_init in the tx object
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 27d41d29c7f093f6f77843624fbb080c1b4a8b9c ]
    
    Since ipoib_cm_tx_start function and ipoib_cm_tx_reap function
    belong to different work queues, they can run in parallel.
    In this case if ipoib_cm_tx_reap calls list_del and release the
    lock, ipoib_cm_tx_start may acquire it and call list_del_init
    on the already deleted object.
    Changing list_del to list_del_init in ipoib_cm_tx_reap fixes the problem.

    This driver reports misc scan input events on the sensor's status

    device initialization, so these events were ignored.

    Input: mpr121 - handle multiple bits change of status register
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 08fea55e37f58371bffc5336a59e55d1f155955a ]
    
    This driver reports input events on their interrupts which are triggered
    by the sensor's status register changes.  But only single bit change is
    reported in the interrupt handler.  So if there are multiple bits are
    changed at almost the same time, other press or release events are ignored.
    
    This fixes it by detecting all changed bits in the status register.

    IPsec: do not ignore crypto err in ah4 input
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ebd89a2d0675f1325c2be5b7576fd8cb7e8defd0 ]
    
    ah4 input processing uses the asynchronous hash crypto API which
    supplies an error code as part of the operation completion but
    the error code was being ignored.
    
    Treat a crypto API error indication as a verification failure.
    
    While a crypto API reported error would almost certainly result
    in a memcpy of the digest failing anyway and thus the security
    risk seems minor, performing a memory compare on what might be
    uninitialized memory is wrong.

    iio: trigger: free trigger resource correctly
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 10e840dfb0b7fc345082dd9e5fff3c1c02e7690e ]
    
    These stand-alone trigger drivers were using iio_trigger_put()
    where they should have been using iio_trigger_free().  The
    iio_trigger_put() adds a module_put which is bad since they
    never did a module_get.
    
    In the sysfs driver, module_get/put's are used as triggers are
    added & removed. This extra module_put() occurs on an error path
    in the probe routine (probably rare).
    
    In the bfin-timer & interrupt trigger drivers, the module resources
    are not explicitly managed, so it's doing a put on something that
    was never get'd.  It occurs on the probe error path and on the
    remove path (not so rare).
    
    Tested with the sysfs trigger driver.
    The bfin & interrupt drivers were build tested & inspected only.

    All pins were configured as NO_PAD_CTL(1 << 31), which was fine as the
    bootloader already did the correct pinmuxing for us.
    But recently u-boot is migrating to reuse device tree files from the
    kernel tree, so it seems to be better to have the correct pinmuxing in
    our files, too.
