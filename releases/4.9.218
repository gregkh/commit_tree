    perf map: Fix off by one in strncpy() size argument
    
    commit db2c549407d4a76563c579e4768f7d6d32afefba upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an off-by-one error in strncpy size argument in
    tools/perf/util/map.c. The issue is that in:
    
            strncmp(filename, "/system/lib/", 11)
    
    the passed string literal: "/system/lib/" has 12 bytes (without the NULL
    byte) and the passed size argument is 11. As a result, the logic won't
    match the ending "/" byte and will pass filepaths that are stored in
    other directories e.g. "/system/libmalicious/bin" or just
    "/system/libmalicious".
    
    This functionality seems to be present only on Android. I assume the
    /system/ directory is only writable by the root user, so I don't think
    this bug has much (or any) security impact.

    arm64: alternative: fix build with clang integrated assembler
    
    commit 6f5459da2b8736720afdbd67c4bd2d1edba7d0e3 upstream.
    
    Building an arm64 defconfig with clang's integrated assembler, this error
    occurs:
        <instantiation>:2:2: error: unrecognized instruction mnemonic
         _ASM_EXTABLE 9999b, 9f
         ^

        user_alt 9f, "dc cvau, x4", "dc civac, x4", 0
        ^
    
    While GNU as seems fine with case-sensitive macro instantiations, clang
    doesn't, so use the actual macro name (_asm_extable) as in the rest of
    the file.
    
    Also checked that the generated assembly matches the GCC output.

    net: ks8851-ml: Fix IO operations, again
    
    commit 8262e6f9b1034ede34548a04dec4c302d92c9497 upstream.
    
    This patch reverts 58292104832f ("net: ks8851-ml: Fix 16-bit IO operation")
    and edacb098ea9c ("net: ks8851-ml: Fix 16-bit data access"), because it
    turns out these were only necessary due to buggy hardware. This patch adds
    a check for such a buggy hardware to prevent any such mistakes again.
    
    While working further on the KS8851 driver, it came to light that the
    KS8851-16MLL is capable of switching bus endianness by a hardware strap,
    EESK pin. If this strap is incorrect, the IO accesses require such endian
    swapping as is being reverted by this patch. Such swapping also impacts
    the performance significantly.
    
    Hence, in addition to removing it, detect that the hardware is broken,
    report to user, and fail to bind with such hardware.

    bpf: Explicitly memset the bpf_attr structure
    
    commit 8096f229421f7b22433775e928d506f0342e5907 upstream.
    
    For the bpf syscall, we are relying on the compiler to properly zero out
    the bpf_attr union that we copy userspace data into. Unfortunately that
    doesn't always work properly, padding and other oddities might not be
    correctly zeroed, and in some tests odd things have been found when the
    stack is pre-initialized to other values.
    
    Fix this by explicitly memsetting the structure to 0 before using it.

    vt: vt_ioctl: fix use-after-free in vt_in_use()
    
    commit 7cf64b18b0b96e751178b8d0505d8466ff5a448f upstream.
    
    vt_in_use() dereferences console_driver->ttys[i] without proper locking.
    This is broken because the tty can be closed and freed concurrently.
    
    We could fix this by using 'READ_ONCE(console_driver->ttys[i]) != NULL'
    and skipping the check of tty_struct::count.  But, looking at
    console_driver->ttys[i] isn't really appropriate anyway because even if
    it is NULL the tty can still be in the process of being closed.
    
    Instead, fix it by making vt_in_use() require console_lock() and check
    whether the vt is allocated and has port refcount > 1.  This works since
    following the patch "vt: vt_ioctl: fix VT_DISALLOCATE freeing in-use
    virtual console" the port refcount is incremented while the vt is open.
    
    Reproducer (very unreliable, but it worked for me after a few minutes):

                    char ttyname[16];
    
                    fd = open("/dev/tty10", O_RDONLY);

                            fork();
                    for (;;) {
                            sprintf(ttyname, "/dev/tty%d", rand() % 8);
                            close(open(ttyname, O_RDONLY));

    vt: vt_ioctl: fix VT_DISALLOCATE freeing in-use virtual console
    
    commit ca4463bf8438b403596edd0ec961ca0d4fbe0220 upstream.
    
    The VT_DISALLOCATE ioctl can free a virtual console while tty_release()
    is still running, causing a use-after-free in con_shutdown().  This
    occurs because VT_DISALLOCATE considers a virtual console's
    'struct vc_data' to be unused as soon as the corresponding tty's
    refcount hits 0.  But actually it may be still being closed.
    
    Fix this by making vc_data be reference-counted via the embedded
    'struct tty_port'.  A newly allocated virtual console has refcount 1.
    Opening it for the first time increments the refcount to 2.  Closing it
    for the last time decrements the refcount (in tty_operations::cleanup()
    so that it happens late enough), as does VT_DISALLOCATE.
    
    Reproducer:

            #include <linux/vt.h>
            #include <sys/ioctl.h>

    vt: vt_ioctl: remove unnecessary console allocation checks
    
    commit 1aa6e058dd6cd04471b1f21298270014daf48ac9 upstream.
    
    The vc_cons_allocated() checks in vt_ioctl() and vt_compat_ioctl() are
    unnecessary because they can only be reached by calling ioctl() on an
    open tty, which implies the corresponding virtual console is allocated.
    
    And even if the virtual console *could* be freed concurrently, then
    these checks would be broken since they aren't done under console_lock,
    and the vc_data is dereferenced before them anyway.
    
    So, remove these unneeded checks to avoid confusion.

    vt: selection, introduce vc_is_sel
    
    commit dce05aa6eec977f1472abed95ccd71276b9a3864 upstream.
    
    Avoid global variables (namely sel_cons) by introducing vc_is_sel. It
    checks whether the parameter is the current selection console. This will
    help putting sel_cons to a struct later.

    mac80211: fix authentication with iwlwifi/mvm
    
    commit be8c827f50a0bcd56361b31ada11dc0a3c2fd240 upstream.
    
    The original patch didn't copy the ieee80211_is_data() condition
    because on most drivers the management frames don't go through
    this path. However, they do on iwlwifi/mvm, so we do need to keep
    the condition here.

    mac80211: Check port authorization in the ieee80211_tx_dequeue() case
    
    commit ce2e1ca703071723ca2dd94d492a5ab6d15050da upstream.
    
    mac80211 used to check port authorization in the Data frame enqueue case
    when going through start_xmit(). However, that authorization status may
    change while the frame is waiting in a queue. Add a similar check in the
    dequeue case to avoid sending previously accepted frames after
    authorization change. This provides additional protection against
    potential leaking of frames after a station has been disconnected and
    the keys for it are being removed.

    libfs: fix infoleak in simple_attr_read()
    
    commit a65cab7d7f05c2061a3e2490257d3086ff3202c6 upstream.
    
    Reading from a debugfs file at a nonzero position, without first reading
    at position 0, leaks uninitialized memory to userspace.
    
    It's a bit tricky to do this, since lseek() and pread() aren't allowed
    on these files, and write() doesn't update the position on them.  But
    writing to them with splice() *does* update the position:
    
            #define _GNU_SOURCE 1
            #include <fcntl.h>
            #include <stdio.h>
            #include <unistd.h>
            int main()
            {
                    int pipes[2], fd, n, i;
                    char buf[32];
    
                    pipe(pipes);
                    write(pipes[1], "0", 1);
                    fd = open("/sys/kernel/debug/fault_around_bytes", O_RDWR);
                    splice(pipes[0], NULL, fd, NULL, 1, 0);
                    n = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
                    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
                            printf("%02x", buf[i]);
                    printf("\n");
            }
    
    Output:
            5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a30
    
    Fix the infoleak by making simple_attr_read() always fill
    simple_attr::get_buf if it hasn't been filled yet.

    usb: musb: fix crash with highmen PIO and usbmon
    
    commit 52974d94a206ce428d9d9b6eaa208238024be82a upstream.
    
    When handling a PIO bulk transfer with highmem buffer, a temporary
    mapping is assigned to urb->transfer_buffer.  After the transfer is
    complete, an invalid address is left behind in this pointer.  This is
    not ordinarily a problem since nothing touches that buffer before the
    urb is released.  However, when usbmon is active, usbmon_urb_complete()
    calls (indirectly) mon_bin_get_data() which does access the transfer
    buffer if it is set.  To prevent an invalid memory access here, reset
    urb->transfer_buffer to NULL when finished (musb_host_rx()), or do not
    set it at all (musb_host_tx()).

    tools: Let O= makes handle a relative path with -C option
    
    [ Upstream commit be40920fbf1003c38ccdc02b571e01a75d890c82 ]
    
    When I tried to compile tools/perf from the top directory with the -C
    option, the O= option didn't work correctly if I passed a relative path:
    
      $ make O=BUILD -C tools/perf/
      make: Entering directory '/home/mhiramat/ksrc/linux/tools/perf'
        BUILD:   Doing 'make -j8' parallel build
      ../scripts/Makefile.include:4: *** O=/home/mhiramat/ksrc/linux/tools/perf/BUILD does not exist.  Stop.
      make: *** [Makefile:70: all] Error 2
      make: Leaving directory '/home/mhiramat/ksrc/linux/tools/perf'
    
    The O= directory existence check failed because the check script ran in
    the build target directory instead of the directory where I ran the make
    command.
    
    To fix that, once change directory to $(PWD) and check O= directory,
    since the PWD is set to where the make command runs.

    The vti6_rcv function performs some tests on the retrieved tunnel
    including checking the IP protocol, the XFRM input policy, the
    source and destination address.
    
    In all but one places the skb is released in the error case. When

    xfrm: fix uctx len check in verify_sec_ctx_len
    
    commit 171d449a028573b2f0acdc7f31ecbb045391b320 upstream.
    
    It's not sufficient to do 'uctx->len != (sizeof(struct xfrm_user_sec_ctx) +
    uctx->ctx_len)' check only, as uctx->len may be greater than nla_len(rt),
    in which case it will cause slab-out-of-bounds when accessing uctx->ctx_str

    genirq: Fix reference leaks on irq affinity notifiers
    
    commit df81dfcfd6991d547653d46c051bac195cd182c1 upstream.
    
    The handling of notify->work did not properly maintain notify->kref in two
     cases:
    1) where the work was already scheduled, another irq_set_affinity_locked()
       would get the ref and (no-op-ly) schedule the work.  Thus when
       irq_affinity_notify() ran, it would drop the original ref but not the
       additional one.
    2) when cancelling the (old) work in irq_set_affinity_notifier(), if there
       was outstanding work a ref had been got for it but was never put.
    Fix both by checking the return values of the work handling functions
     (schedule_work() for (1) and cancel_work_sync() for (2)) and put the
     extra ref if the return value indicates preexisting work.

    commit b16798f5b907733966fd1a558fca823b3c67e4a1 upstream.
    
    If a station is still marked as authorized, mark it as no longer
    so before removing its keys. This allows frames transmitted to it
    to be rejected, providing additional protection against leaking
    plain text data during the disconnection flow.

    scsi: sd: Fix optimal I/O size for devices that change reported values
    
    commit ea697a8bf5a4161e59806fab14f6e4a46dc7dcb0 upstream.
    
    Some USB bridge devices will return a default set of characteristics during
    initialization. And then, once an attached drive has spun up, substitute
    the actual parameters reported by the drive. According to the SCSI spec,
    the device should return a UNIT ATTENTION in case any reported parameters
    change. But in this case the change is made silently after a small window
    where default values are reported.
    
    Commit a83da8a4509d ("scsi: sd: Optimal I/O size should be a multiple of
    physical block size") validated the reported optimal I/O size against the
    physical block size to overcome problems with devices reporting nonsensical
    transfer sizes. However, this validation did not account for the fact that
    aforementioned devices will return default values during a brief window
    during spin-up. The subsequent change in reported characteristics would
    invalidate the checking that had previously been performed.
    
    Unset a previously configured optimal I/O size should the sanity checking
    fail on subsequent revalidate attempts.

    scripts/dtc: Remove redundant YYLOC global declaration
    
    commit e33a814e772cdc36436c8c188d8c42d019fda639 upstream.
    
    gcc 10 will default to -fno-common, which causes this error at link
    time:
    
      (.text+0x0): multiple definition of `yylloc'; dtc-lexer.lex.o (symbol from plugin):(.text+0x0): first defined here
    
    This is because both dtc-lexer as well as dtc-parser define the same
    global symbol yyloc. Before with -fcommon those were merged into one
    defintion. The proper solution would be to to mark this as "extern",
    however that leads to:
    
      dtc-lexer.l:26:16: error: redundant redeclaration of 'yylloc' [-Werror=redundant-decls]
       26 | extern YYLTYPE yylloc;

    dtc-parser.tab.h:127:16: note: previous declaration of 'yylloc' was here

          |                ^~~~~~
    cc1: all warnings being treated as errors
    
    which means the declaration is completely redundant and can just be

    commit 1efde2754275dbd9d11c6e0132a4f09facf297ab upstream.
    
    Do not depend on dwfl_module_addrsym() because it can fail on user-space

    get actual symbol address from symtab.
    
    This fixes it again by getting symbol address from DIE, and only if the
    DIE has only address range, it uses dwfl_module_addrsym().

    commit cfb5d65f25959f724081bae8445a0241db606af6 upstream.
    
    The L3 interconnect's memory map is from 0x0 to
    0xffffffff. Out of this, System memory (SDRAM) can be
    accessed from 0x80000000 to 0xffffffff (2GB)

    accessed by the MPU subsystem.
    
    Add the dma-ranges property to reflect the physical address limit
    of the L3 bus.
    
    Issues ere observed only with SATA on DRA7-EVM with 4GB RAM
    and CONFIG_ARM_LPAE enabled. This is because the controller
    supports 64-bit DMA and its driver sets the dma_mask to 64-bit
    thus resulting in DMA accesses beyond L3 limit of 2G.
    
    Setting the correct bus_dma_limit fixes the issue.

    [ Upstream commit f3cc008bf6d59b8d93b4190e01d3e557b0040e15 ]
    
    This patch fixes an off-by-one error in strncpy size argument in
    drivers/net/ethernet/samsung/sxgbe/sxgbe_main.c. The issue is that in:
    
            strncmp(opt, "eee_timer:", 6)
    
    the passed string literal: "eee_timer:" has 10 bytes (without the NULL
    byte) and the passed size argument is 6. As a result, the logic will
    also accept other, malformed strings, e.g. "eee_tiXXX:".
    
    This bug doesn't seem to have any security impact since its present in
    module's cmdline parsing code.

    As a part of the scan process Linux will allocate and configure a
    scsi_device for each target to be scanned. If the device is not present,
    then the scsi_device is torn down. As a part of scsi_device teardown a
    workqueue item will be scheduled and the lockups we see are because there
    are 250k workqueue items to be processed.  Accoding to the specification of
    SIS-64 sas controller, max_channel should be decreased on SIS-64 adapters
    to 4.
    
    The patch fixes softlockup issue.
    
    Thanks for Oliver Halloran's help with debugging and explanation!

    The FMAN internal queue can overflow when FMAN splits single
    read or write transactions into multiple smaller transactions
    such that more than 17 AXI transactions are in flight from FMAN
    to interconnect. When the FMAN internal queue overflows, it can
    stall further packet processing. The issue can occur with any one
    of the following three conditions:
    
      1. FMAN AXI transaction crosses 4K address boundary (Errata
         A010022)
      2. FMAN DMA address for an AXI transaction is not 16 byte
         aligned, i.e. the last 4 bits of an address are non-zero
      3. Scatter Gather (SG) frames have more than one SG buffer in
         the SG list and any one of the buffers, except the last
         buffer in the SG list has data size that is not a multiple
         of 16 bytes, i.e., other than 16, 32, 48, 64, etc.
    
    With any one of the above three conditions present, there is
    likelihood of stalled FMAN packet processing, especially under
    stress with multiple ports injecting line-rate traffic.
    
    To avoid situations that stall FMAN packet processing, all of the
    above three conditions must be avoided; therefore, configure the
    system with the following rules:
    
      1. Frame buffers must not span a 4KB address boundary, unless
         the frame start address is 256 byte aligned
      2. All FMAN DMA start addresses (for example, BMAN buffer
         address, FD[address] + FD[offset]) are 16B aligned
      3. SG table and buffer addresses are 16B aligned and the size
         of SG buffers are multiple of 16 bytes, except for the last
         SG buffer that can be of any size.
    
    Additional workaround notes:
    - Address alignment of 64 bytes is recommended for maximally
    efficient system bus transactions (although 16 byte alignment is
    sufficient to avoid the stall condition)
    - To support frame sizes that are larger than 4K bytes, there are
    two options:
      1. Large single buffer frames that span a 4KB page boundary can
         be converted into SG frames to avoid transaction splits at
         the 4KB boundary,
      2. Align the large single buffer to 256B address boundaries,
         ensure that the frame address plus offset is 256B aligned.
    - If software generated SG frames have buffers that are unaligned
    and with random non-multiple of 16 byte lengths, before
    transmitting such frames via FMAN, frames will need to be copied
    into a new single buffer or multiple buffer SG frame that is
    compliant with the three rules listed above.

    net: ipv4: don't let PMTU updates increase route MTU
    
    [ Upstream commit 28d35bcdd3925e7293408cdb8aa5f2aac5f0d6e3 ]
    
    When an MTU update with PMTU smaller than net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu is
    received, we must clamp its value. However, we can receive a PMTU
    exception with PMTU < old_mtu < ip_rt_min_pmtu, which would lead to an
    increase in PMTU.
    
    To fix this, take the smallest of the old MTU and ip_rt_min_pmtu.
    
    Before this patch, in case of an update, the exception's MTU would
    always change. Now, an exception can have only its lock flag updated,
    but not the MTU, so we need to add a check on locking to the following
    "is this exception getting updated, or close to expiring?" test.

    KVM: VMX: Do not allow reexecute_instruction() when skipping MMIO instr
    
    [ Upstream commit c4409905cd6eb42cfd06126e9226b0150e05a715 ]
    
    Re-execution after an emulation decode failure is only intended to
    handle a case where two or vCPUs race to write a shadowed page, i.e.
    we should never re-execute an instruction as part of MMIO emulation.
    As handle_ept_misconfig() is only used for MMIO emulation, it should
    pass EMULTYPE_NO_REEXECUTE when using the emulator to skip an instr
    in the fast-MMIO case where VM_EXIT_INSTRUCTION_LEN is invalid.
    
    And because the cr2 value passed to x86_emulate_instruction() is only
    destined for use when retrying or reexecuting, we can simply call
    emulate_instruction().
    
    Fixes: d391f1207067 ("x86/kvm/vmx: do not use vm-exit instruction length

    hsr: set .netnsok flag
    
    [ Upstream commit 09e91dbea0aa32be02d8877bd50490813de56b9a ]
    
    The hsr module has been supporting the list and status command.
    (HSR_C_GET_NODE_LIST and HSR_C_GET_NODE_STATUS)
    These commands send node information to the user-space via generic netlink.
    But, in the non-init_net namespace, these commands are not allowed
    because .netnsok flag is false.
    So, there is no way to get node information in the non-init_net namespace.

    However, the current code mistakenly removes the new one. This

    use-after-free too, as reported by syzbot.

    [ Upstream commit 3a303cfdd28d5f930a307c82e8a9d996394d5ebd ]
    
    The port->hsr is used in the hsr_handle_frame(), which is a
    callback of rx_handler.
    hsr master and slaves are initialized in hsr_add_port().
    This function initializes several pointers, which includes port->hsr after
    registering rx_handler.
    So, in the rx_handler routine, un-initialized pointer would be used.
    In order to fix this, pointers should be initialized before
    registering rx_handler.

    Revert "drm/dp_mst: Skip validating ports during destruction, just ref"
    
    commit 9765635b30756eb74e05e260ac812659c296cd28 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit:
    
    c54c7374ff44 ("drm/dp_mst: Skip validating ports during destruction, just ref")
    
    ugh.
    
    In drm_dp_destroy_connector_work(), we have a pretty good chance of
    freeing the actual struct drm_dp_mst_port. However, after destroying
    things we send a hotplug through (*mgr->cbs->hotplug)(mgr) which is
    where the problems start.
    
    For i915, this calls all the way down to the fbcon probing helpers,
    which start trying to access the port in a modeset.

    So, this definitely isn't a fix that we want. This being said; there's
    no real easy fix for this problem because of some of the catch-22's of
    the MST helpers current design. For starters; we always need to validate
    a port with drm_dp_get_validated_port_ref(), but validation relies on
    the lifetime of the port in the actual topology. So once the port is
    gone, it can't be validated again.
    
    If we were to try to make the payload helpers not use port validation,
    then we'd cause another problem: if the port isn't validated, it could
    be freed and we'd just start causing more KASAN issues. There are
    already hacks that attempt to workaround this in
    drm_dp_mst_destroy_connector_work() by re-initializing the kref so that
    it can be used again and it's memory can be freed once the VCPI helpers
    finish removing the port's respective payloads. But none of these really
    do anything helpful since the port still can't be validated since it's
    gone from the topology. Also, that workaround is immensely confusing to
    read through.
    
    What really needs to be done in order to fix this is to teach DRM how to
    track the lifetime of the structs for MST ports and branch devices
    separately from their lifetime in the actual topology. Simply put; this
    means having two different krefs-one that removes the port/branch device
    from the topology, and one that finally calls kfree(). This would let us
    simplify things, since we'd now be able to keep ports around without
    having to keep them in the topology at the same time, which is exactly
    what we need in order to teach our VCPI helpers to only validate ports
    when it's actually necessary without running the risk of trying to use
    unallocated memory.
    
    Such a fix is on it's way, but for now let's play it safe and just
    revert this. If this bug has been around for well over a year, we can
    wait a little while to get an actual proper fix here.

    staging: greybus: loopback_test: fix potential path truncations
    
    commit ae62cf5eb2792d9a818c2d93728ed92119357017 upstream.
    
    Newer GCC warns about possible truncations of two generated path names as
    we're concatenating the configurable sysfs and debugfs path prefixes
    with a filename and placing the results in buffers of the same size as
    the maximum length of the prefixes.
    
            snprintf(d->name, MAX_STR_LEN, "gb_loopback%u", dev_id);
    
            snprintf(d->sysfs_entry, MAX_SYSFS_PATH, "%s%s/",
                     t->sysfs_prefix, d->name);
    
            snprintf(d->debugfs_entry, MAX_SYSFS_PATH, "%sraw_latency_%s",
                     t->debugfs_prefix, d->name);
    
    Fix this by separating the maximum path length from the maximum prefix
    length and reducing the latter enough to fit the generated strings.
    
    Note that we also need to reduce the device-name buffer size as GCC
    isn't smart enough to figure out that we ever only used MAX_STR_LEN
    bytes of it.

    arm64: smp: fix smp_send_stop() behaviour
    
    commit d0bab0c39e32d39a8c5cddca72e5b4a3059fe050 upstream.
    
    On a system with only one CPU online, when another one CPU panics while
    starting-up, smp_send_stop() will fail to send any STOP message to the
    other already online core, resulting in a system still responsive and
    alive at the end of the panic procedure.

    Make smp_send_stop() account also for the online status of the calling CPU
    while evaluating how many CPUs are effectively online: this way, the right
    number of STOPs is sent, so enforcing a proper freeze of the system at the
    end of panic even under the above conditions.

    futex: Unbreak futex hashing
    
    commit 8d67743653dce5a0e7aa500fcccb237cde7ad88e upstream.
    
    The recent futex inode life time fix changed the ordering of the futex key
    union struct members, but forgot to adjust the hash function accordingly,
    
    As a result the hashing omits the leading 64bit and even hashes beyond the
    futex key causing a bad hash distribution which led to a ~100% performance
    regression.
    
    Hand in the futex key pointer instead of a random struct member and make
    the size calculation based of the struct offset.

    As reported by Jann, ihold() does not in fact guarantee inode
    persistence. And instead of making it so, replace the usage of inode
    pointers with a per boot, machine wide, unique inode identifier.
    
    This sequence number is global, but shared (file backed) futexes are

    kbuild: Disable -Wpointer-to-enum-cast
    
    commit 82f2bc2fcc0160d6f82dd1ac64518ae0a4dd183f upstream.
    
    Clang's -Wpointer-to-int-cast deviates from GCC in that it warns when
    casting to enums. The kernel does this in certain places, such as device
    tree matches to set the version of the device being used, which allows
    the kernel to avoid using a gigantic union.

    To avoid a ton of false positive warnings, disable this particular part
    of the warning, which has been split off into a separate diagnostic so
    that the entire warning does not need to be turned off for clang. It
    will be visible under W=1 in case people want to go about fixing these
    easily and enabling the warning treewide.

    [ Upstream commit b401f8c4f492cbf74f3f59c9141e5be3071071bb ]
    
    By default, tty_port_init() initializes those parameters to a multiple
    of HZ. For instance in line 69 of tty_port.c:
       port->close_delay = (50 * HZ) / 100;
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/tty/tty_port.c#L69
    
    With e.g. CONFIG_HZ = 250 (as this is the case for Ubuntu 18.04
    linux-image-4.15.0-37-generic), the default setting for close_delay is
    thus 125.
    
    When ioctl(fd, TIOCGSERIAL, &s) is executed, the setting returned in
    user space is '12' (125/10). When ioctl(fd, TIOCSSERIAL, &s) is then
    executed with the same setting '12', the value is interpreted as '120'
    which is different from the current setting and a EPERM error may be
    raised by set_serial_info() if !CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

    x86/mm: split vmalloc_sync_all()
    
    commit 763802b53a427ed3cbd419dbba255c414fdd9e7c upstream.
    
    Commit 3f8fd02b1bf1 ("mm/vmalloc: Sync unmappings in
    __purge_vmap_area_lazy()") introduced a call to vmalloc_sync_all() in
    the vunmap() code-path.  While this change was necessary to maintain
    correctness on x86-32-pae kernels, it also adds additional cycles for
    architectures that don't need it.
    
    Specifically on x86-64 with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y some people reported
    severe performance regressions in micro-benchmarks because it now also
    calls the x86-64 implementation of vmalloc_sync_all() on vunmap().  But
    the vmalloc_sync_all() implementation on x86-64 is only needed for newly
    created mappings.
    
    To avoid the unnecessary work on x86-64 and to gain the performance
    back, split up vmalloc_sync_all() into two functions:
    
            * vmalloc_sync_mappings(), and
            * vmalloc_sync_unmappings()
    
    Most call-sites to vmalloc_sync_all() only care about new mappings being
    synchronized.  The only exception is the new call-site added in the
    above mentioned commit.
    
    Shile Zhang directed us to a report of an 80% regression in reaim
    throughput.

    This is a PowerPC platform with following NUMA topology:
    
      available: 2 nodes (0-1)
      node 0 cpus:
      node 0 size: 0 MB
      node 0 free: 0 MB
      node 1 cpus: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
      node 1 size: 35247 MB
      node 1 free: 30907 MB
      node distances:
      node   0   1
        0:  10  40
        1:  40  10
    
      possible numa nodes: 0-31
    
    This only happens with a mmotm patch "mm/memcontrol.c: allocate
    shrinker_map on appropriate NUMA node" [2] which effectively calls
    kmalloc_node for each possible node.  SLUB however only allocates
    kmem_cache_node on online N_NORMAL_MEMORY nodes, and relies on
    node_to_mem_node to return such valid node for other nodes since commit
    a561ce00b09e ("slub: fall back to node_to_mem_node() node if allocating
    on memoryless node").  This is however not true in this configuration
    where the _node_numa_mem_ array is not initialized for nodes 0 and 2-31,
    thus it contains zeroes and get_partial() ends up accessing
    non-allocated kmem_cache_node.
    
    A related issue was reported by Bharata (originally by Ramachandran) [3]
    where a similar PowerPC configuration, but with mainline kernel without
    patch [2] ends up allocating large amounts of pages by kmalloc-1k
    kmalloc-512.  This seems to have the same underlying issue with
    node_to_mem_node() not behaving as expected, and might probably also
    lead to an infinite loop with CONFIG_SLUB_CPU_PARTIAL [4].
    
    This patch should fix both issues by not relying on node_to_mem_node()
    anymore and instead simply falling back to NUMA_NO_NODE, when
    kmalloc_node(node) is attempted for a node that's not online, or has no
    usable memory.  The "usable memory" condition is also changed from
    node_present_pages() to N_NORMAL_MEMORY node state, as that is exactly
    the condition that SLUB uses to allocate kmem_cache_node structures.
    The check in get_partial() is removed completely, as the checks in
    ___slab_alloc() are now sufficient to prevent get_partial() being
    reached with an invalid node.

    mm: slub: be more careful about the double cmpxchg of freelist
    
    commit 5076190daded2197f62fe92cf69674488be44175 upstream.
    
    This is just a cleanup addition to Jann's fix to properly update the
    transaction ID for the slub slowpath in commit fd4d9c7d0c71 ("mm: slub:
    add missing TID bump..").
    
    The transaction ID is what protects us against any concurrent accesses,
    but we should really also make sure to make the 'freelist' comparison
    itself always use the same freelist value that we then used as the new
    next free pointer.
    
    Jann points out that if we do all of this carefully, we could skip the
    transaction ID update for all the paths that only remove entries from
    the lists, and only update the TID when adding entries (to avoid the ABA
    issue with cmpxchg and list handling re-adding a previously seen value).
    
    But this patch just does the "make sure to cmpxchg the same value we
    used" rather than then try to be clever.

    memcg: fix NULL pointer dereference in __mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event
    
    commit 7d36665a5886c27ca4c4d0afd3ecc50b400f3587 upstream.
    
    An eventfd monitors multiple memory thresholds of the cgroup, closes them,
    the kernel deletes all events related to this eventfd.  Before all events
    are deleted, another eventfd monitors the memory threshold of this cgroup,
    leading to a crash:

    We can reproduce this problem in the following ways:
    
    1. We create a new cgroup subdirectory and a new eventfd, and then we
       monitor multiple memory thresholds of the cgroup through this eventfd.
    
    2.  closing this eventfd, and __mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event ()
       will be called multiple times to delete all events related to this
       eventfd.
    
    The first time __mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event() is called, the
    kernel will clear all items related to this eventfd in thresholds->
    primary.
    
    Since there is currently only one eventfd, thresholds-> primary becomes
    empty, so the kernel will set thresholds-> primary and hresholds-> spare
    to NULL.  If at this time, the user creates a new eventfd and monitor
    the memory threshold of this cgroup, kernel will re-initialize
    thresholds-> primary.
    
    Then when __mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event () is called for the
    second time, because thresholds-> primary is not empty, the system will
    access thresholds-> spare, but thresholds-> spare is NULL, which will
    trigger a crash.
    
    In general, the longer it takes to delete all events related to this
    eventfd, the easier it is to trigger this problem.
    
    The solution is to check whether the thresholds associated with the
    eventfd has been cleared when deleting the event.  If so, we do nothing.

    commit 9d32c0cde4e2d1343dfb88a67b2ec6397705b32b upstream.
    
    get_char was erroneously given the address of the pointer to the text
    instead of the address of the text, thus leading to random crashes when
    the user requests speaking a word while the current position is on a space
    character and say_word_ctl is not enabled.

    SAMA5D2x doesn't drive CMD line if GPIO is used as CD line (at least
    SAMA5D27 doesn't). Fix this by forcing card-detect in the module
    if module-controlled CD is not used.

    The return value checks in snd_pcm_plug_alloc() are covered with
    snd_BUG_ON() macro that may trigger a kernel WARNING depending on the
    kconfig.  But since the error condition can be triggered by a weird
    user space parameter passed to OSS layer, we shouldn't give the kernel
    stack trace just for that.  As it's a normal error condition, let's
    remove snd_BUG_ON() macro usage there.

    ALSA: pcm: oss: Avoid plugin buffer overflow
    
    commit f2ecf903ef06eb1bbbfa969db9889643d487e73a upstream.
    
    Each OSS PCM plugins allocate its internal buffer per pre-calculation
    of the max buffer size through the chain of plugins (calling
    src_frames and dst_frames callbacks).  This works for most plugins,
    but the rate plugin might behave incorrectly.  The calculation in the
    rate plugin involves with the fractional position, i.e. it may vary
    depending on the input position.  Since the buffer size
    pre-calculation is always done with the offset zero, it may return a
    shorter size than it might be; this may result in the out-of-bound
    access as spotted by fuzzer.
    
    This patch addresses those possible buffer overflow accesses by simply
    setting the upper limit per the given buffer size for each plugin
    before src_frames() and after dst_frames() calls.

    commit 4384f167ce5fa7241b61bb0984d651bc528ddebe upstream.
    
    The virmidi driver handles sysex event exceptionally in a short-cut
    snd_seq_dump_var_event() call, but this missed the reset of the
    running status.  As a result, it may lead to an incomplete command
    right after the sysex when an event with the same running status was
    queued.
    
    Fix it by clearing the running status properly via alling
    snd_midi_event_reset_decode() for that code path.

    ALSA: line6: Fix endless MIDI read loop
    
    commit d683469b3c93d7e2afd39e6e1970f24700eb7a68 upstream.
    
    The MIDI input event parser of the LINE6 driver may enter into an
    endless loop when the unexpected data sequence is given, as it tries
    to continue the secondary bytes without termination.  Also, when the
    input data is too short, the parser returns a negative error, while
    the caller doesn't handle it properly.  This would lead to the
    unexpected behavior as well.
    
    This patch addresses those issues by checking the return value
    correctly and handling the one-byte event in the parser properly.
    
    The bug was reported by syzkaller.

    usb: quirks: add NO_LPM quirk for RTL8153 based ethernet adapters
    
    commit 75d7676ead19b1fbb5e0ee934c9ccddcb666b68c upstream.
    
    We have been receiving bug reports that ethernet connections over
    RTL8153 based ethernet adapters stops working after a while with
    errors like these showing up in dmesg when the ethernet stops working:
    
    [12696.189484] r8152 6-1:1.0 enp10s0u1: Tx timeout
    [12702.333456] r8152 6-1:1.0 enp10s0u1: Tx timeout
    [12707.965422] r8152 6-1:1.0 enp10s0u1: Tx timeout
    
    This has been reported on Dell WD15 docks, Belkin USB-C Express Dock 3.1
    docks and with generic USB to ethernet dongles using the RTL8153
    chipsets. Some users have tried adding usbcore.quirks=0bda:8153:k to
    the kernel commandline and all users who have tried this report that
    this fixes this.
    
    Also note that we already have an existing NO_LPM quirk for the RTL8153
    used in the Microsoft Surface Dock (where it uses a different usb-id).
    
    This commit adds a NO_LPM quirk for the generic Realtek RTL8153
    0bda:8153 usb-id, fixing the Tx timeout errors on these devices.

    altera-stapl: altera_get_note: prevent write beyond end of 'key'
    
    [ Upstream commit 3745488e9d599916a0b40d45d3f30e3d4720288e ]
    
    altera_get_note is called from altera_init, where key is kzalloc(33).
    
    When the allocation functions are annotated to allow the compiler to see
    the sizes of objects, and with FORTIFY_SOURCE, we see:
    
    In file included from drivers/misc/altera-stapl/altera.c:14:0:
    In function ‘strlcpy’,
        inlined from ‘altera_init’ at drivers/misc/altera-stapl/altera.c:2189:5:
    include/linux/string.h:378:4: error: call to ‘__write_overflow’ declared with attribute error: detected write beyond size of object passed as 1st parameter
        __write_overflow();
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    That refers to this code in altera_get_note:
    
        if (key != NULL)
                strlcpy(key, &p[note_strings +
                                get_unaligned_be32(
                                &p[note_table + (8 * i)])],
                        length);
    
    The error triggers because the length of 'key' is 33, but the copy
    uses length supplied as the 'length' parameter, which is always
    256. Split the size parameter into key_len and val_len, and use the
    appropriate length depending on what is being copied.
    
    Detected by compiler error, only compile-tested.

    [ Upstream commit c0fd99d659ba5582e09625c7a985d63fc2ca74b5 ]
    
    Writing to the built-in strings arrays doesn't work if driver is loaded
    as kernel module. This is also considered as a bad pattern. Fix this by
    adding a call to clk_get() with legacy clock name. This fixes following
    kernel oops if driver is loaded as module:

    spi/zynqmp: remove entry that causes a cs glitch
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dd8304981ecffa77bb72b1c57c4be5dfe6cfae9 ]
    
    In the public interface for chipselect, there is always an entry
    commented as "Dummy generic FIFO entry" pushed down to the fifo right
    after the activate/deactivate command. The dummy entry is 0x0,
    irregardless if the intention was to activate or deactive the cs. This
    causes the cs line to glitch rather than beeing activated in the case
    when there was an activate command.
    
    This has been observed on oscilloscope, and have caused problems for at
    least one specific flash device type connected to the qspi port. After
    the change the glitch is gone and cs goes active when intended.
    
    The reason why this worked before (except for the glitch) was because
    when sending the actual data, the CS bits are once again set. Since
    most flashes uses mode 0, there is always a half clk period anyway for
    cs to clk active setup time. If someone would rely on timing from a
    chip_select call to a transfer_one, it would fail though.
    
    It is unknown why the dummy entry was there in the first place, git log
    seems to be of no help in this case. The reference manual gives no
    indication of the necessity of this. In fact the lower 8 bits are a
    setup (or hold in case of deactivate) time expressed in cycles. So this
    should not be needed to fulfill any setup/hold timings.

    ARM: dts: dra7: Add "dma-ranges" property to PCIe RC DT nodes
    
    [ Upstream commit 27f13774654ea6bd0b6fc9b97cce8d19e5735661 ]
    
    'dma-ranges' in a PCI bridge node does correctly set dma masks for PCI
    devices not described in the DT. Certain DRA7 platforms (e.g., DRA76)
    has RAM above 32-bit boundary (accessible with LPAE config) though the
    PCIe bridge will be able to access only 32-bits. Add 'dma-ranges'
    property in PCIe RC DT nodes to indicate the host bridge can access
    only 32 bits.
