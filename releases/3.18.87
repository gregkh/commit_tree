    usb: host: fix incorrect updating of offset
    
    commit 1d5a31582ef046d3b233f0da1a68ae26519b2f0a upstream.
    
    The variable temp is incorrectly being updated, instead it should
    be offset otherwise the loop just reads the same capability value
    and loops forever.  Thanks to Alan Stern for pointing out the
    correct fix to my original fix.  Fix also cleans up clang warning:
    
    drivers/usb/host/ehci-dbg.c:840:4: warning: Value stored to 'temp'
    is never read

    USB: devio: Prevent integer overflow in proc_do_submiturb()
    
    commit 57999d1107c1e60c2ca7088f2ac0f819e2f554b3 upstream.
    
    There used to be an integer overflow check in proc_do_submiturb() but
    we removed it.  It turns out that it's still required.  The
    uurb->buffer_length variable is a signed integer and it's controlled by
    the user.  It can lead to an integer overflow when we do:
    
            num_sgs = DIV_ROUND_UP(uurb->buffer_length, USB_SG_SIZE);
    
    If we strip away the macro then that line looks like this:
    
            num_sgs = (uurb->buffer_length + USB_SG_SIZE - 1) / USB_SG_SIZE;
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    It's the first addition which can overflow.

    usb: hub: Cycle HUB power when initialization fails
    
    commit 973593a960ddac0f14f0d8877d2d0abe0afda795 upstream.
    
    Sometimes the USB device gets confused about the state of the initialization and
    the connection fails. In particular, the device thinks that it's already set up
    and running while the host thinks the device still needs to be configured. To
    work around this issue, power-cycle the hub's output to issue a sort of "reset"
    to the device. This makes the device restart its state machine and then the
    initialization succeeds.
    
    This fixes problems where the kernel reports a list of errors like this:
    
    usb 1-1.3: device not accepting address 19, error -71
    
    The end result is a non-functioning device. After this patch, the sequence
    becomes like this:
    
    usb 1-1.3: new high-speed USB device number 18 using ci_hdrc
    usb 1-1.3: device not accepting address 18, error -71
    usb 1-1.3: new high-speed USB device number 19 using ci_hdrc
    usb 1-1.3: device not accepting address 19, error -71
    usb 1-1-port3: attempt power cycle

    mm: avoid returning VM_FAULT_RETRY from ->page_mkwrite handlers
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 0911d0041c22922228ca52a977d7b0b0159fee4b ]
    
    Some ->page_mkwrite handlers may return VM_FAULT_RETRY as its return
    code (GFS2 or Lustre can definitely do this).  However VM_FAULT_RETRY
    from ->page_mkwrite is completely unhandled by the mm code and results
    in locking and writeably mapping the page which definitely is not what
    the caller wanted.
    
    Fix Lustre and block_page_mkwrite_ret() used by other filesystems
    (notably GFS2) to return VM_FAULT_NOPAGE instead which results in
    bailing out from the fault code, the CPU then retries the access, and we
    fault again effectively doing what the handler wanted.

    Currently, the client is being to conservative, and is assuming that

    The reason for the wrong error reporting is the return value of the
    system() library call. It is called in run_dir() file tests/attr.c and
    returns the exit status, in above case 0xff00.
    
    This value is given as parameter to the exit() function which can only
    handle values 0-0xff.
    
    The child process terminates with exit value of 0 and the parent does
    not detect any error.
    
    This patch corrects the error reporting and prints the correct test
    result.

    This can be seen on a common board like an r-pi3.
    This happens because when echo p >/proc/sysrq-trigger,
    get_irq_regs() is called outside of IRQ context,
    if preemption is enabled in this situation,kernel will
    print the call trace. Since many prior discussions on
    the mailing lists have made it clear that get_irq_regs
    either just returns NULL or stale data when used outside
    of IRQ context,we simply avoid calling it outside of
    IRQ context.

    serial: 8250_fintek: Fix rs485 disablement on invalid ioctl()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 3236a965486ba0c6043cf2c7b51943d8b382ae29 ]
    
    This driver's ->rs485_config callback checks if SER_RS485_RTS_ON_SEND
    and SER_RS485_RTS_AFTER_SEND have the same value.  If they do, it means
    the user has passed in invalid data with the TIOCSRS485 ioctl()
    since RTS must have a different polarity when sending and when not
    sending.  In this case, rs485 mode is not enabled (the RS485_URA bit
    is not set in the RS485 Enable Register) and this is supposed to be
    signaled back to the user by clearing the SER_RS485_ENABLED bit in
    struct serial_rs485 ... except a missing tilde character is preventing
    that from happening.

    bcache: recover data from backing when data is clean
    
    commit e393aa2446150536929140739f09c6ecbcbea7f0 upstream.
    
    When we send a read request and hit the clean data in cache device, there
    is a situation called cache read race in bcache(see the commit in the tail
    of cache_look_up(), the following explaination just copy from there):
    The bucket we're reading from might be reused while our bio is in flight,
    and we could then end up reading the wrong data. We guard against this
    by checking (in bch_cache_read_endio()) if the pointer is stale again;
    if so, we treat it as an error (s->iop.error = -EINTR) and reread from
    the backing device (but we don't pass that error up anywhere)
    
    It should be noted that cache read race happened under normal
    circumstances, not the circumstance when SSD failed, it was counted
    and shown in  /sys/fs/bcache/XXX/internal/cache_read_races.
    
    Without this patch, when we use writeback mode, we will never reread from
    the backing device when cache read race happened, until the whole cache
    device is clean, because the condition
    (s->recoverable && (dc && !atomic_read(&dc->has_dirty))) is false in
    cached_dev_read_error(). In this situation, the s->iop.error(= -EINTR)
    will be passed up, at last, user will receive -EINTR when it's bio end,
    this is not suitable, and wield to up-application.
    
    In this patch, we use s->read_dirty_data to judge whether the read
    request hit dirty data in cache device, it is safe to reread data from
    the backing device when the read request hit clean data. This can not
    only handle cache read race, but also recover data when failed read
    request from cache device.

    bcache: only permit to recovery read error when cache device is clean
    
    commit d59b23795933678c9638fd20c942d2b4f3cd6185 upstream.
    
    When bcache does read I/Os, for example in writeback or writethrough mode,
    if a read request on cache device is failed, bcache will try to recovery
    the request by reading from cached device. If the data on cached device is
    not synced with cache device, then requester will get a stale data.
    
    For critical storage system like database, providing stale data from
    recovery may result an application level data corruption, which is
    unacceptible.
    
    With this patch, for a failed read request in writeback or writethrough
    mode, recovery a recoverable read request only happens when cache device
    is clean. That is to say, all data on cached device is up to update.
    
    For other cache modes in bcache, read request will never hit
    cached_dev_read_error(), they don't need this patch.
    
    Please note, because cache mode can be switched arbitrarily in run time, a
    writethrough mode might be switched from a writeback mode. Therefore
    checking dc->has_data in writethrough mode still makes sense.
    
    Changelog:
    V4: Fix parens error pointed by Michael Lyle.
    v3: By response from Kent Oversteet, he thinks recovering stale data is a
        bug to fix, and option to permit it is unnecessary. So this version
        the sysfs file is removed.
    v2: rename sysfs entry from allow_stale_data_on_failure  to
        allow_stale_data_on_failure, and fix the confusing commit log.
    v1: initial patch posted.
