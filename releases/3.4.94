    ahci: Add Device ID for HighPoint RocketRaid 642L
    
    commit d251836508fb26cd1a22b41381739835ee23728d upstream.
    
    This device normally comes with a proprietary driver, using a web GUI
    to configure RAID:
     http://www.highpoint-tech.com/USA_new/series_rr600-download.htm
    But thankfully it also works out of the box with the AHCI driver,
    being just a Marvell 88SE9235.
    
    Devices 640L, 644L, 644LS should also be supported but not tested here.

    SCSI: megaraid: Use resource_size_t for PCI resources, not long
    
    commit 11f8a7b31f2140b0dc164bb484281235ffbe51d3 upstream.
    
    The assumption that sizeof(long) >= sizeof(resource_size_t) can lead to
    truncation of the PCI resource address, meaning this driver didn't work
    on 32-bit systems with 64-bit PCI adressing ranges.

    Staging: zram: Fix memory leak by refcount mismatch
    
    commit 1b672224d128ec2570eb37572ff803cfe452b4f7 upstream.
    
    As suggested by Minchan Kim and Jerome Marchand "The code in reset_store
    get the block device (bdget_disk()) but it does not put it (bdput()) when
    it's done using it. The usage count is therefore incremented but never
    decremented."
    
    This patch also puts bdput() for all error cases.

    zram: protect sysfs handler from invalid memory access
    
    commit 5863e10b441e7ea4b492f930f1be180a97d026f3 upstream.
    
    Use zram->init_lock to protect access to zram->meta, otherwise it
    may cause invalid memory access if zram->meta has been freed by
    zram_reset_device().
    
    This issue may be triggered by:
    Thread 1:

    while true; do echo 8M > disksize; echo 1 > reset; done

    powerpc: Fix 64 bit builds with binutils 2.24
    
    commit 7998eb3dc700aaf499f93f50b3d77da834ef9e1d upstream.
    
    With binutils 2.24, various 64 bit builds fail with relocation errors
    such as
    
    arch/powerpc/kernel/built-in.o: In function `exc_debug_crit_book3e':
            (.text+0x165ee): relocation truncated to fit: R_PPC64_ADDR16_HI
            against symbol `interrupt_base_book3e' defined in .text section
            in arch/powerpc/kernel/built-in.o
    arch/powerpc/kernel/built-in.o: In function `exc_debug_crit_book3e':
            (.text+0x16602): relocation truncated to fit: R_PPC64_ADDR16_HI
            against symbol `interrupt_end_book3e' defined in .text section
            in arch/powerpc/kernel/built-in.o
    
    The assembler maintainer says:
    
     I changed the ABI, something that had to be done but unfortunately
     happens to break the booke kernel code.  When building up a 64-bit
     value with lis, ori, shl, oris, ori or similar sequences, you now
     should use @high and @higha in place of @h and @ha.  @h and @ha
     (and their associated relocs R_PPC64_ADDR16_HI and R_PPC64_ADDR16_HA)
     now report overflow if the value is out of 32-bit signed range.
     ie. @h and @ha assume you're building a 32-bit value. This is needed
     to report out-of-range -mcmodel=medium toc pointer offsets in @toc@h
     and @toc@ha expressions, and for consistency I did the same for all
     other @h and @ha relocs.
    
    Replacing @h with @high in one strategic location fixes the relocation
    errors. This has to be done conditionally since the assembler either
    supports @h or @high but not both.

    netfilter: ipv4: defrag: set local_df flag on defragmented skb
    
    commit 895162b1101b3ea5db08ca6822ae9672717efec0 upstream.
    
    else we may fail to forward skb even if original fragments do fit
    outgoing link mtu:
    
    1. remote sends 2k packets in two 1000 byte frags, DF set
    2. we want to forward but only see '2k > mtu and DF set'
    3. we then send icmp error saying that outgoing link is 1500
    
    But original sender never sent a packet that would not fit
    the outgoing link.
    
    Setting local_df makes outgoing path test size vs.
    IPCB(skb)->frag_max_size, so we will still send the correct
    error in case the largest original size did not fit
    outgoing link mtu.

    mlx4_en: don't use napi_synchronize inside mlx4_en_netpoll
    
    commit c98235cb8584a72e95786e17d695a8e5fafcd766 upstream.
    
    The mlx4 driver is triggering schedules while atomic inside
    mlx4_en_netpoll:
    
            spin_lock_irqsave(&cq->lock, flags);
            napi_synchronize(&cq->napi);
                    ^^^^^ msleep here
            mlx4_en_process_rx_cq(dev, cq, 0);
            spin_unlock_irqrestore(&cq->lock, flags);
    
    This was part of a patch by Alexander Guller from Mellanox in 2011,
    but it still isn't upstream.
