    fuse: Add FOPEN_STREAM to use stream_open()
    
    commit bbd84f33652f852ce5992d65db4d020aba21f882 upstream.
    
    Starting from commit 9c225f2655e3 ("vfs: atomic f_pos accesses as per
    POSIX") files opened even via nonseekable_open gate read and write via lock
    and do not allow them to be run simultaneously. This can create read vs
    write deadlock if a filesystem is trying to implement a socket-like file
    which is intended to be simultaneously used for both read and write from
    filesystem client.  See commit 10dce8af3422 ("fs: stream_open - opener for
    stream-like files so that read and write can run simultaneously without
    deadlock") for details and e.g. commit 581d21a2d02a ("xenbus: fix deadlock
    on writes to /proc/xen/xenbus") for a similar deadlock example on
    /proc/xen/xenbus.
    
    To avoid such deadlock it was tempting to adjust fuse_finish_open to use
    stream_open instead of nonseekable_open on just FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE flags,
    but grepping through Debian codesearch shows users of FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE,
    and in particular GVFS which actually uses offset in its read and write
    handlers
    
            https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=-%3Enonseekable+%3D
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1080
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1247-1346
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1399-1481
    
    so if we would do such a change it will break a real user.
    
    Add another flag (FOPEN_STREAM) for filesystem servers to indicate that the
    opened handler is having stream-like semantics; does not use file position
    and thus the kernel is free to issue simultaneous read and write request on
    opened file handle.
    
    This patch together with stream_open() should be added to stable kernels
    starting from v3.14+. This will allow to patch OSSPD and other FUSE
    filesystems that provide stream-like files to return FOPEN_STREAM |
    FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE in open handler and this way avoid the deadlock on all
    kernel versions. This should work because fuse_finish_open ignores unknown
    open flags returned from a filesystem and so passing FOPEN_STREAM to a
    kernel that is not aware of this flag cannot hurt. In turn the kernel that
    is not aware of FOPEN_STREAM will be < v3.14 where just FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE
    is sufficient to implement streams without read vs write deadlock.

    fs: stream_open - opener for stream-like files so that read and write can run simultaneously without deadlock
    
    commit 10dce8af34226d90fa56746a934f8da5dcdba3df upstream.
    
    Commit 9c225f2655e3 ("vfs: atomic f_pos accesses as per POSIX") added
    locking for file.f_pos access and in particular made concurrent read and
    write not possible - now both those functions take f_pos lock for the
    whole run, and so if e.g. a read is blocked waiting for data, write will
    deadlock waiting for that read to complete.
    
    This caused regression for stream-like files where previously read and
    write could run simultaneously, but after that patch could not do so
    anymore. See e.g. commit 581d21a2d02a ("xenbus: fix deadlock on writes
    to /proc/xen/xenbus") which fixes such regression for particular case of
    /proc/xen/xenbus.
    
    The patch that added f_pos lock in 2014 did so to guarantee POSIX thread
    safety for read/write/lseek and added the locking to file descriptors of
    all regular files. In 2014 that thread-safety problem was not new as it
    was already discussed earlier in 2006.
    
    However even though 2006'th version of Linus's patch was adding f_pos
    locking "only for files that are marked seekable with FMODE_LSEEK (thus
    avoiding the stream-like objects like pipes and sockets)", the 2014
    version - the one that actually made it into the tree as 9c225f2655e3 -
    is doing so irregardless of whether a file is seekable or not.
    
    See
    
        https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/53022DB1.4070805@gmail.com/
        https://lwn.net/Articles/180387
        https://lwn.net/Articles/180396
    
    for historic context.
    
    The reason that it did so is, probably, that there are many files that
    are marked non-seekable, but e.g. their read implementation actually
    depends on knowing current position to correctly handle the read. Some
    examples:
    
            kernel/power/user.c             snapshot_read
            fs/debugfs/file.c               u32_array_read
            fs/fuse/control.c               fuse_conn_waiting_read + ...
            drivers/hwmon/asus_atk0110.c    atk_debugfs_ggrp_read
            arch/s390/hypfs/inode.c         hypfs_read_iter
            ...
    
    Despite that, many nonseekable_open users implement read and write with
    pure stream semantics - they don't depend on passed ppos at all. And for
    those cases where read could wait for something inside, it creates a
    situation similar to xenbus - the write could be never made to go until
    read is done, and read is waiting for some, potentially external, event,
    for potentially unbounded time -> deadlock.
    
    Besides xenbus, there are 14 such places in the kernel that I've found
    with semantic patch (see below):
    
            drivers/xen/evtchn.c:667:8-24: ERROR: evtchn_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/isdn/capi/capi.c:963:8-24: ERROR: capi_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/input/evdev.c:527:1-17: ERROR: evdev_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()

            net/rfkill/core.c:1146:8-24: ERROR: rfkill_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/s390/char/fs3270.c:488:1-17: ERROR: fs3270_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/usb/misc/ldusb.c:310:1-17: ERROR: ld_usb_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/hid/uhid.c:635:1-17: ERROR: uhid_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            net/batman-adv/icmp_socket.c:80:1-17: ERROR: batadv_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/media/rc/lirc_dev.c:198:1-17: ERROR: lirc_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/leds/uleds.c:77:1-17: ERROR: uleds_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/input/misc/uinput.c:400:1-17: ERROR: uinput_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/infiniband/core/user_mad.c:985:7-23: ERROR: umad_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/gnss/core.c:45:1-17: ERROR: gnss_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
    
    In addition to the cases above another regression caused by f_pos
    locking is that now FUSE filesystems that implement open with
    FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE flag, can no longer implement bidirectional
    stream-like files - for the same reason as above e.g. read can deadlock
    write locking on file.f_pos in the kernel.
    
    FUSE's FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE was added in 2008 in a7c1b990f715 ("fuse:
    implement nonseekable open") to support OSSPD. OSSPD implements /dev/dsp
    in userspace with FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE flag, with corresponding read and
    write routines not depending on current position at all, and with both
    read and write being potentially blocking operations:
    
    See
    
        https://github.com/libfuse/osspd
        https://lwn.net/Articles/308445
    
        https://github.com/libfuse/osspd/blob/14a9cff0/osspd.c#L1406
        https://github.com/libfuse/osspd/blob/14a9cff0/osspd.c#L1438-L1477
        https://github.com/libfuse/osspd/blob/14a9cff0/osspd.c#L1479-L1510
    
    Corresponding libfuse example/test also describes FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE as
    "somewhat pipe-like files ..." with read handler not using offset.
    However that test implements only read without write and cannot exercise
    the deadlock scenario:
    
        https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/fuse-3.4.2-3-ga1bff7d/example/poll.c#L124-L131
        https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/fuse-3.4.2-3-ga1bff7d/example/poll.c#L146-L163
        https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/fuse-3.4.2-3-ga1bff7d/example/poll.c#L209-L216
    
    I've actually hit the read vs write deadlock for real while implementing
    my FUSE filesystem where there is /head/watch file, for which open
    creates separate bidirectional socket-like stream in between filesystem
    and its user with both read and write being later performed
    simultaneously. And there it is semantically not easy to split the
    stream into two separate read-only and write-only channels:
    
        https://lab.nexedi.com/kirr/wendelin.core/blob/f13aa600/wcfs/wcfs.go#L88-169
    
    Let's fix this regression. The plan is:
    
    1. We can't change nonseekable_open to include &~FMODE_ATOMIC_POS -
       doing so would break many in-kernel nonseekable_open users which
       actually use ppos in read/write handlers.
    
    2. Add stream_open() to kernel to open stream-like non-seekable file
       descriptors. Read and write on such file descriptors would never use
       nor change ppos. And with that property on stream-like files read and
       write will be running without taking f_pos lock - i.e. read and write
       could be running simultaneously.
    
    3. With semantic patch search and convert to stream_open all in-kernel
       nonseekable_open users for which read and write actually do not
       depend on ppos and where there is no other methods in file_operations
       which assume @offset access.
    
    4. Add FOPEN_STREAM to fs/fuse/ and open in-kernel file-descriptors via
       steam_open if that bit is present in filesystem open reply.
    
       It was tempting to change fs/fuse/ open handler to use stream_open
       instead of nonseekable_open on just FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE flags, but
       grepping through Debian codesearch shows users of FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE,
       and in particular GVFS which actually uses offset in its read and
       write handlers
    
            https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=-%3Enonseekable+%3D
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1080
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1247-1346
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1399-1481
    
       so if we would do such a change it will break a real user.
    
    5. Add stream_open and FOPEN_STREAM handling to stable kernels starting
       from v3.14+ (the kernel where 9c225f2655 first appeared).
    
       This will allow to patch OSSPD and other FUSE filesystems that
       provide stream-like files to return FOPEN_STREAM | FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE
       in their open handler and this way avoid the deadlock on all kernel
       versions. This should work because fs/fuse/ ignores unknown open
       flags returned from a filesystem and so passing FOPEN_STREAM to a
       kernel that is not aware of this flag cannot hurt. In turn the kernel
       that is not aware of FOPEN_STREAM will be < v3.14 where just
       FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE is sufficient to implement streams without read vs
       write deadlock.
    
    This patch adds stream_open, converts /proc/xen/xenbus to it and adds
    semantic patch to automatically locate in-kernel places that are either
    required to be converted due to read vs write deadlock, or that are just
    safe to be converted because read and write do not use ppos and there
    are no other funky methods in file_operations.
    
    Regarding semantic patch I've verified each generated change manually -
    that it is correct to convert - and each other nonseekable_open instance
    left - that it is either not correct to convert there, or that it is not
    converted due to current stream_open.cocci limitations.
    
    The script also does not convert files that should be valid to convert,
    but that currently have .llseek = noop_llseek or generic_file_llseek for
    unknown reason despite file being opened with nonseekable_open (e.g.
    drivers/input/mousedev.c)

    TTY: serial_core, add ->install
    
    commit 4cdd17ba1dff20ffc99fdbd2e6f0201fc7fe67df upstream.
    
    We need to compute the uart state only on the first open. This is
    usually what is done in the ->install hook. serial_core used to do this
    in ->open on every open. So move it to ->install.
    
    As a side effect, it ensures the state is set properly in the window
    after tty_init_dev is called, but before uart_open. This fixes a bunch
    of races between tty_open and flush_to_ldisc we were dealing with
    recently.
    
    One of such bugs was attempted to fix in commit fedb5760648a (serial:
    fix race between flush_to_ldisc and tty_open), but it only took care of
    a couple of functions (uart_start and uart_unthrottle).  I was able to
    reproduce the crash on a SLE system, but in uart_write_room which is
    also called from flush_to_ldisc via process_echoes. I was *unable* to
    reproduce the bug locally. It is due to having this patch in my queue
    since 2012!

    This was supposed to be a mask of all known rings, but it is being used
    by execbuffer to filter out invalid rings, and so is instead mapping high

    genwqe: Prevent an integer overflow in the ioctl
    
    commit 110080cea0d0e4dfdb0b536e7f8a5633ead6a781 upstream.
    
    There are a couple potential integer overflows here.
    
            round_up(m->size + (m->addr & ~PAGE_MASK), PAGE_SIZE);
    
    The first thing is that the "m->size + (...)" addition could overflow,
    and the second is that round_up() overflows to zero if the result is
    within PAGE_SIZE of the type max.
    
    In this code, the "m->size" variable is an u64 but we're saving the
    result in "map_size" which is an unsigned long and genwqe_user_vmap()
    takes an unsigned long as well.  So I have used ULONG_MAX as the upper
    bound.  From a practical perspective unsigned long is fine/better than
    trying to change all the types to u64.

    MIPS: pistachio: Build uImage.gz by default
    
    commit e4f2d1af7163becb181419af9dece9206001e0a6 upstream.
    
    The pistachio platform uses the U-Boot bootloader & generally boots a
    kernel in the uImage format. As such it's useful to build one when
    building the kernel, but to do so currently requires the user to
    manually specify a uImage target on the make command line.
    
    Make uImage.gz the pistachio platform's default build target, so that
    the default is to build a kernel image that we can actually boot on a
    board such as the MIPS Creator Ci40.
    
    Marked for stable backport as far as v4.1 where pistachio support was
    introduced. This is primarily useful for CI systems such as kernelci.org
    which will benefit from us building a suitable image which can then be
    booted as part of automated testing, extending our test coverage to the
    affected stable branches.

    x86/power: Fix 'nosmt' vs hibernation triple fault during resume
    
    commit ec527c318036a65a083ef68d8ba95789d2212246 upstream.
    
    As explained in
    
            0cc3cd21657b ("cpu/hotplug: Boot HT siblings at least once")
    
    we always, no matter what, have to bring up x86 HT siblings during boot at
    least once in order to avoid first MCE bringing the system to its knees.
    
    That means that whenever 'nosmt' is supplied on the kernel command-line,
    all the HT siblings are as a result sitting in mwait or cpudile after
    going through the online-offline cycle at least once.
    
    This causes a serious issue though when a kernel, which saw 'nosmt' on its
    commandline, is going to perform resume from hibernation: if the resume
    from the hibernated image is successful, cr3 is flipped in order to point
    to the address space of the kernel that is being resumed, which in turn
    means that all the HT siblings are all of a sudden mwaiting on address
    which is no longer valid.
    
    That results in triple fault shortly after cr3 is switched, and machine
    reboots.
    
    Fix this by always waking up all the SMT siblings before initiating the
    'restore from hibernation' process; this guarantees that all the HT
    siblings will be properly carried over to the resumed kernel waiting in
    resume_play_dead(), and acted upon accordingly afterwards, based on the
    target kernel configuration.
    
    Symmetricaly, the resumed kernel has to push the SMT siblings to mwait
    again in case it has SMT disabled; this means it has to online all
    the siblings when resuming (so that they come out of hlt) and offline
    them again to let them reach mwait.

    commit 63923d2c3800919774f5c651d503d1dd2adaddd5 upstream.
    
    We only support I/O to kernel space. Using %sr1 to load the coherence
    index may be racy unless interrupts are disabled. This patch changes the
    code used to load the coherence index to use implicit space register

    rcu: locking and unlocking need to always be at least barriers
    
    commit 66be4e66a7f422128748e3c3ef6ee72b20a6197b upstream.
    
    Herbert Xu pointed out that commit bb73c52bad36 ("rcu: Don't disable
    preemption for Tiny and Tree RCU readers") was incorrect in making the
    preempt_disable/enable() be conditional on CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT.
    
    If CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT isn't enabled, the preemption enable/disable is
    a no-op, but still is a compiler barrier.
    
    And RCU locking still _needs_ that compiler barrier.
    
    It is simply fundamentally not true that RCU locking would be a complete
    no-op: we still need to guarantee (for example) that things that can
    trap and cause preemption cannot migrate into the RCU locked region.
    
    The way we do that is by making it a barrier.
    
    See for example commit 386afc91144b ("spinlocks and preemption points
    need to be at least compiler barriers") from back in 2013 that had
    similar issues with spinlocks that become no-ops on UP: they must still
    constrain the compiler from moving other operations into the critical
    region.
    
    Now, it is true that a lot of RCU operations already use READ_ONCE() and
    WRITE_ONCE() (which in practice likely would never be re-ordered wrt
    anything remotely interesting), but it is also true that that is not
    globally the case, and that it's not even necessarily always possible
    (ie bitfields etc).

    ipv6: fix EFAULT on sendto with icmpv6 and hdrincl
    
    [ Upstream commit b9aa52c4cb457e7416cc0c95f475e72ef4a61336 ]
    
    The following code returns EFAULT (Bad address):
    
      s = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_ICMPV6);
      setsockopt(s, SOL_IPV6, IPV6_HDRINCL, 1);
      sendto(ipv6_icmp6_packet, addr);   /* returns -1, errno = EFAULT */
    
    The IPv4 equivalent code works. A workaround is to use IPPROTO_RAW
    instead of IPPROTO_ICMPV6.
    
    The failure happens because 2 bytes are eaten from the msghdr by
    rawv6_probe_proto_opt() starting from commit 19e3c66b52ca ("ipv6
    equivalent of "ipv4: Avoid reading user iov twice after
    raw_probe_proto_opt""), but at that time it was not a problem because
    IPV6_HDRINCL was not yet introduced.
    
    Only eat these 2 bytes if hdrincl == 0.

    pktgen: do not sleep with the thread lock held.
    
    [ Upstream commit 720f1de4021f09898b8c8443f3b3e995991b6e3a ]
    
    Currently, the process issuing a "start" command on the pktgen procfs
    interface, acquires the pktgen thread lock and never release it, until
    all pktgen threads are completed. The above can blocks indefinitely any
    other pktgen command and any (even unrelated) netdevice removal - as
    the pktgen netdev notifier acquires the same lock.
    
    The issue is demonstrated by the following script, reported by Matteo:
    
    ip -b - <<'EOF'
            link add type dummy
            link add type veth
            link set dummy0 up
    EOF
    modprobe pktgen
    echo reset >/proc/net/pktgen/pgctrl
    {
            echo rem_device_all
            echo add_device dummy0
    } >/proc/net/pktgen/kpktgend_0
    echo count 0 >/proc/net/pktgen/dummy0
    echo start >/proc/net/pktgen/pgctrl &
    sleep 1
    rmmod veth
    
    Fix the above releasing the thread lock around the sleep call.
    
    Additionally we must prevent racing with forcefull rmmod - as the
    thread lock no more protects from them. Instead, acquire a self-reference
    before waiting for any thread. As a side effect, running
    
    rmmod pktgen
    
    while some thread is running now fails with "module in use" error,
    before this patch such command hanged indefinitely.
    
    Note: the issue predates the commit reported in the fixes tag, but
    this fix can't be applied before the mentioned commit.
    
    v1 -> v2:
     - no need to check for thread existence after flipping the lock,
       pktgen threads are freed only at net exit time
     -

    neighbor: Call __ipv4_neigh_lookup_noref in neigh_xmit
    
    [ Upstream commit 4b2a2bfeb3f056461a90bd621e8bd7d03fa47f60 ]
    
    Commit cd9ff4de0107 changed the key for IFF_POINTOPOINT devices to
    INADDR_ANY but neigh_xmit which is used for MPLS encapsulations was not
    updated to use the altered key. The result is that every packet Tx does
    a lookup on the gateway address which does not find an entry, a new one
    is created only to find the existing one in the table right before the
    insert since arp_constructor was updated to reset the primary key. This
    is seen in the allocs and destroys counters:
        ip -s -4 ntable show | head -10 | grep alloc
    
    which increase for each packet showing the unnecessary overhread.
    
    Fix by having neigh_xmit use __ipv4_neigh_lookup_noref for NEIGH_ARP_TABLE.

    ethtool: fix potential userspace buffer overflow
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ee4e76937d69128a6a66861ba393ebdc2ffc8a2 ]
    
    ethtool_get_regs() allocates a buffer of size ops->get_regs_len(),
    and pass it to the kernel driver via ops->get_regs() for filling.
    
    There is no restriction about what the kernel drivers can or cannot do
    with the open ethtool_regs structure. They usually set regs->version
    and ignore regs->len or set it to the same size as ops->get_regs_len().
    
    But if userspace allocates a smaller buffer for the registers dump,
    we would cause a userspace buffer overflow in the final copy_to_user()
    call, which uses the regs.len value potentially reset by the driver.
    
    To fix this, make this case obvious and store regs.len before calling
    ops->get_regs(), to only copy as much data as requested by userspace,
    up to the value returned by ops->get_regs_len().
    
    While at it, remove the redundant check for non-null regbuf.

    mm: make page ref count overflow check tighter and more explicit
    
    commit f958d7b528b1b40c44cfda5eabe2d82760d868c3 upstream.
    
    We have a VM_BUG_ON() to check that the page reference count doesn't
    underflow (or get close to overflow) by checking the sign of the count.
    
    That's all fine, but we actually want to allow people to use a "get page
    ref unless it's already very high" helper function, and we want that one
    to use the sign of the page ref (without triggering this VM_BUG_ON).
    
    Change the VM_BUG_ON to only check for small underflows (or _very_ close
    to overflowing), and ignore overflows which have strayed into negative
    territory.

    commit 8fde12ca79aff9b5ba951fce1a2641901b8d8e64 upstream.
    
    If the page refcount wraps around past zero, it will be freed while
    there are still four billion references to it.  One of the possible
    avenues for an attacker to try to make this happen is by doing direct IO
    on a page multiple times.  This patch makes get_user_pages() refuse to
    take a new page reference if there are already more than two billion
    references to the page.

    mm, gup: ensure real head page is ref-counted when using hugepages
    
    commit d63206ee32b6e64b0e12d46e5d6004afd9913713 upstream.
    
    When speculatively taking references to a hugepage using
    page_cache_add_speculative() in gup_huge_pmd(), it is assumed that the
    page returned by pmd_page() is the head page.  Although normally true,
    this assumption doesn't hold when the hugepage comprises of successive
    page table entries such as when using contiguous bit on arm64 at PTE or
    PMD levels.
    
    This can be addressed by ensuring that the page passed to
    page_cache_add_speculative() is the real head or by de-referencing the
    head page within the function.
    
    We take the first approach to keep the usage pattern aligned with
    page_cache_get_speculative() where users already pass the appropriate
    page, i.e., the de-referenced head.
    
    Apply the same logic to fix gup_huge_[pud|pgd]() as well.

    mm, gup: remove broken VM_BUG_ON_PAGE compound check for hugepages
    
    commit a3e328556d41bb61c55f9dfcc62d6a826ea97b85 upstream.
    
    When operating on hugepages with DEBUG_VM enabled, the GUP code checks
    the compound head for each tail page prior to calling
    page_cache_add_speculative.  This is broken, because on the fast-GUP
    path (where we don't hold any page table locks) we can be racing with a
    concurrent invocation of split_huge_page_to_list.
    
    split_huge_page_to_list deals with this race by using page_ref_freeze to
    freeze the page and force concurrent GUPs to fail whilst the component
    pages are modified.  This modification includes clearing the
    compound_head field for the tail pages, so checking this prior to a
    successful call to page_cache_add_speculative can lead to false
    positives: In fact, page_cache_add_speculative *already* has this check
    once the page refcount has been successfully updated, so we can simply
    remove the broken calls to VM_BUG_ON_PAGE.

    brcmfmac: assure SSID length from firmware is limited
    
    commit 1b5e2423164b3670e8bc9174e4762d297990deff upstream.
    
    The SSID length as received from firmware should not exceed
    IEEE80211_MAX_SSID_LEN as that would result in heap overflow.

    staging: vc04_services: prevent integer overflow in create_pagelist()
    
    commit ca641bae6da977d638458e78cd1487b6160a2718 upstream.
    
    The create_pagelist() "count" parameter comes from the user in
    vchiq_ioctl() and it could overflow.  If you look at how create_page()
    is called in vchiq_prepare_bulk_data(), then the "size" variable is an
    int so it doesn't make sense to allow negatives or larger than INT_MAX.
    
    I don't know this code terribly well, but I believe that typical values
    of "count" are typically quite low and I don't think this check will
    affect normal valid uses at all.
    
    The "pagelist_size" calculation can also overflow on 32 bit systems, but
    not on 64 bit systems.  I have added an integer overflow check for that
    as well.
    
    The Raspberry PI doesn't offer the same level of memory protection that
    x86 does so these sorts of bugs are probably not super critical to fix.

    kernel/signal.c: trace_signal_deliver when signal_group_exit
    
    commit 98af37d624ed8c83f1953b1b6b2f6866011fc064 upstream.
    
    In the fixes commit, removing SIGKILL from each thread signal mask and
    executing "goto fatal" directly will skip the call to
    "trace_signal_deliver".  At this point, the delivery tracking of the
    SIGKILL signal will be inaccurate.
    
    Therefore, we need to add trace_signal_deliver before "goto fatal" after
    executing sigdelset.
    
    Note: SEND_SIG_NOINFO matches the fact that SIGKILL doesn't have any info.

    memcg: make it work on sparse non-0-node systems
    
    commit 3e8589963773a5c23e2f1fe4bcad0e9a90b7f471 upstream.
    
    We have a single node system with node 0 disabled:
      Scanning NUMA topology in Northbridge 24
      Number of physical nodes 2
      Skipping disabled node 0
      Node 1 MemBase 0000000000000000 Limit 00000000fbff0000
      NODE_DATA(1) allocated [mem 0xfbfda000-0xfbfeffff]
    
    This causes crashes in memcg when system boots:
      BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000008
      #PF error: [normal kernel read fault]
    ...
      RIP: 0010:list_lru_add+0x94/0x170
    ...
      Call Trace:
       d_lru_add+0x44/0x50
       dput.part.34+0xfc/0x110
       __fput+0x108/0x230
       task_work_run+0x9f/0xc0
       exit_to_usermode_loop+0xf5/0x100
    
    It is reproducible as far as 4.12.  I did not try older kernels.  You have
    to have a new enough systemd, e.g.  241 (the reason is unknown -- was not
    investigated).  Cannot be reproduced with systemd 234.
    
    The system crashes because the size of lru array is never updated in
    memcg_update_all_list_lrus and the reads are past the zero-sized array,
    causing dereferences of random memory.
    
    The root cause are list_lru_memcg_aware checks in the list_lru code.  The
    test in list_lru_memcg_aware is broken: it assumes node 0 is always
    present, but it is not true on some systems as can be seen above.
    
    So fix this by avoiding checks on node 0.  Remember the memcg-awareness by
    a bool flag in struct list_lru.

    commit 5d24f455c182d5116dd5db8e1dc501115ecc9c2c upstream.
    
    The datasheet states:
    
      Bit 4: ClockEnSet the ClockEn bit high to enable an external clocking
    (crystal or clock generator at XIN). Set the ClockEn bit to 0 to disable
    clocking
      Bit 1: CrystalEnSet the CrystalEn bit high to enable the crystal
    oscillator. When using an external clock source at XIN, CrystalEn must
    be set low.
    
    The bit 4, MAX310X_CLKSRC_EXTCLK_BIT, should be set and was not.
    
    This was required to make the MAX3107 with an external crystal on our
    board able to send or receive data.

    drm/nouveau/i2c: Disable i2c bus access after ->fini()
    
    commit 342406e4fbba9a174125fbfe6aeac3d64ef90f76 upstream.
    
    For a while, we've had the problem of i2c bus access not grabbing
    a runtime PM ref when it's being used in userspace by i2c-dev, resulting
    in nouveau spamming the kernel log with errors if anything attempts to
    access the i2c bus while the GPU is in runtime suspend. An example:
    
    [  130.078386] nouveau 0000:01:00.0: i2c: aux 000d: begin idle timeout ffffffff
    
    Since the GPU is in runtime suspend, the MMIO region that the i2c bus is
    on isn't accessible. On x86, the standard behavior for accessing an
    unavailable MMIO region is to just return ~0.
    
    Except, that turned out to be a lie. While computers with a clean
    concious will return ~0 in this scenario, some machines will actually
    completely hang a CPU on certian bad MMIO accesses. This was witnessed
    with someone's Lenovo ThinkPad P50, where sensors-detect attempting to
    access the i2c bus while the GPU was suspended would result in a CPU
    hang:

      watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#5 stuck for 23s! [sensors-detect:12438]
    
    Yikes! While I wanted to try to make it so that accessing an i2c bus on
    nouveau would wake up the GPU as needed, airlied pointed out that pretty
    much any usecase for userspace accessing an i2c bus on a GPU (mainly for
    the DDC brightness control that some displays have) is going to only be
    useful while there's at least one display enabled on the GPU anyway, and
    the GPU never sleeps while there's displays running.
    
    Since teaching the i2c bus to wake up the GPU on userspace accesses is a
    good deal more difficult than it might seem, mostly due to the fact that
    we have to use the i2c bus during runtime resume of the GPU, we instead
    opt for the easiest solution: don't let userspace access i2c busses on
    the GPU at all while it's in runtime suspend.
    
    Changes since v1:
    * Also disable i2c busses that run over DP AUX

    commit 317d9313925cd8388304286c0d3c8dda7f060a2d upstream.
    
    I measured power consumption between power_save_node=1 and power_save_node=0.
    It's almost the same.
    Codec will enter to runtime suspend and suspend.
    That pin also will enter to D3. Don't need to enter to D3 by single pin.
    So, Disable power_save_node as default. It will avoid more issues.
    Windows Driver also has not this option at runtime PM.

    powerpc/perf: Fix MMCRA corruption by bhrb_filter
    
    commit 3202e35ec1c8fc19cea24253ff83edf702a60a02 upstream.
    
    Consider a scenario where user creates two events:
    
      1st event:
        attr.sample_type |= PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK;
        attr.branch_sample_type = PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_ANY;
        fd = perf_event_open(attr, 0, 1, -1, 0);
    
      This sets cpuhw->bhrb_filter to 0 and returns valid fd.
    
      2nd event:
        attr.sample_type |= PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK;
        attr.branch_sample_type = PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_CALL;
        fd = perf_event_open(attr, 0, 1, -1, 0);
    
      It overrides cpuhw->bhrb_filter to -1 and returns with error.
    
    Now if power_pmu_enable() gets called by any path other than
    power_pmu_add(), ppmu->config_bhrb(-1) will set MMCRA to -1.

    Btrfs: fix race updating log root item during fsync
    
    commit 06989c799f04810f6876900d4760c0edda369cf7 upstream.
    
    When syncing the log, the final phase of a fsync operation, we need to
    either create a log root's item or update the existing item in the log
    tree of log roots, and that depends on the current value of the log
    root's log_transid - if it's 1 we need to create the log root item,
    otherwise it must exist already and we update it. Since there is no
    synchronization between updating the log_transid and checking it for
    deciding whether the log root's item needs to be created or updated, we
    end up with a tiny race window that results in attempts to update the
    item to fail because the item was not yet created:
    
                  CPU 1                                    CPU 2
    
      btrfs_sync_log()
    
        lock root->log_mutex
    
        set log root's log_transid to 1
    
        unlock root->log_mutex
    
                                                   btrfs_sync_log()
    
                                                     lock root->log_mutex
    
                                                     sets log root's
                                                     log_transid to 2
    
                                                     unlock root->log_mutex
    
        update_log_root()
    
          sees log root's log_transid
          with a value of 2
    
            calls btrfs_update_root(),
            which fails with -EUCLEAN
            and causes transaction abort
    
    Until recently the race lead to a BUG_ON at btrfs_update_root(), but after
    the recent commit 7ac1e464c4d47 ("btrfs: Don't panic when we can't find a
    root key") we just abort the current transaction.

    scsi: zfcp: fix to prevent port_remove with pure auto scan LUNs (only sdevs)
    
    commit ef4021fe5fd77ced0323cede27979d80a56211ca upstream.
    
    When the user tries to remove a zfcp port via sysfs, we only rejected it if
    there are zfcp unit children under the port. With purely automatically
    scanned LUNs there are no zfcp units but only SCSI devices. In such cases,
    the port_remove erroneously continued. We close the port and this
    implicitly closes all LUNs under the port. The SCSI devices survive with
    their private zfcp_scsi_dev still holding a reference to the "removed"
    zfcp_port (still allocated but invisible in sysfs) [zfcp_get_port_by_wwpn
    in zfcp_scsi_slave_alloc]. This is not a problem as long as the fc_rport
    stays blocked. Once (auto) port scan brings back the removed port, we
    unblock its fc_rport again by design.  However, there is no mechanism that
    would recover (open) the LUNs under the port (no "ersfs_3" without
    zfcp_unit [zfcp_erp_strategy_followup_success]).  Any pending or new I/O to
    such LUN leads to repeated:
    
      Done: NEEDS_RETRY Result: hostbyte=DID_IMM_RETRY driverbyte=DRIVER_OK
    
    See also v4.10 commit 6f2ce1c6af37 ("scsi: zfcp: fix rport unblock race
    with LUN recovery"). Even a manual LUN recovery
    (echo 0 > /sys/bus/scsi/devices/H:C:T:L/zfcp_failed)
    does not help, as the LUN links to the old "removed" port which remains
    to lack ZFCP_STATUS_COMMON_RUNNING [zfcp_erp_required_act].
    The only workaround is to first ensure that the fc_rport is blocked
    (e.g. port_remove again in case it was re-discovered by (auto) port scan),
    then delete the SCSI devices, and finally re-discover by (auto) port scan.
    The port scan includes an fc_rport unblock, which in turn triggers
    a new scan on the scsi target to freshly get new pure auto scan LUNs.
    
    Fix this by rejecting port_remove also if there are SCSI devices
    (even without any zfcp_unit) under this port. Re-use mechanics from v3.7
    commit d99b601b6338 ("[SCSI] zfcp: restore refcount check on port_remove").
    However, we have to give up zfcp_sysfs_port_units_mutex earlier in unit_add
    to prevent a deadlock with scsi_host scan taking shost->scan_mutex first
    and then zfcp_sysfs_port_units_mutex now in our zfcp_scsi_slave_alloc().

    media: smsusb: better handle optional alignment
    
    commit a47686636d84eaec5c9c6e84bd5f96bed34d526d upstream.
    
    Most Siano devices require an alignment for the response.
    
    Changeset f3be52b0056a ("media: usb: siano: Fix general protection fault in smsusb")
    changed the logic with gets such aligment, but it now produces a
    sparce warning:
    
    drivers/media/usb/siano/smsusb.c: In function 'smsusb_init_device':
    drivers/media/usb/siano/smsusb.c:447:37: warning: 'in_maxp' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

          |                             ~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    The sparse message itself is bogus, but a broken (or fake) USB
    eeprom could produce a negative value for response_alignment.
    
    So, change the code in order to check if the result is not
    negative.

    commit 31e0456de5be379b10fea0fa94a681057114a96e upstream.
    
    The syzkaller USB fuzzer found a general-protection-fault bug in the
    smsusb part of the Siano DVB driver.  The fault occurs during probe
    because the driver assumes without checking that the device has both
    IN and OUT endpoints and the IN endpoint is ep1.
    
    By slightly rearranging the driver's initialization code, we can make
    the appropriate checks early on and thus avoid the problem.  If the
    expected endpoints aren't present, the new code safely returns -ENODEV
    from the probe routine.

    USB: Add LPM quirk for Surface Dock GigE adapter
    
    commit ea261113385ac0a71c2838185f39e8452d54b152 upstream.
    
    Without USB_QUIRK_NO_LPM ethernet will not work and rtl8152 will
    complain with
    
        r8152 <device...>: Stop submitting intr, status -71
    
    Adding the quirk resolves this. As the dock is externally powered, this
    should not have any drawbacks.

    USB: Fix slab-out-of-bounds write in usb_get_bos_descriptor
    
    commit a03ff54460817c76105f81f3aa8ef655759ccc9a upstream.
    
    The syzkaller USB fuzzer found a slab-out-of-bounds write bug in the
    USB core, caused by a failure to check the actual size of a BOS
    descriptor.  This patch adds a check to make sure the descriptor is at
    least as large as it is supposed to be, so that the code doesn't
    inadvertently access memory beyond the end of the allocated region
    when assigning to dev->bos->desc->bNumDeviceCaps later on.

    usbip: usbip_host: fix BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context
    
    commit 0c9e8b3cad654bfc499c10b652fbf8f0b890af8f upstream.
    
    stub_probe() and stub_disconnect() call functions which could call
    sleeping function in invalid context whil holding busid_lock.
    
    Fix the problem by refining the lock holds to short critical sections
    to change the busid_priv fields. This fix restructures the code to
    limit the lock holds in stub_probe() and stub_disconnect().

    Tracking this down shows that udev->bos is NULL in the following code:

            field = le32_to_cpu(udev->bos->ext_cap->bmAttributes);  <<<<<<< here

                            enable ? "enable" : "disable", port_num + 1);
    
            if (enable) {

                    if (udev->usb2_hw_lpm_besl_capable) {

                             */
                            if ((field & USB_BESL_SUPPORT) &&
                                (field & USB_BESL_BASELINE_VALID))
                                    hird = USB_GET_BESL_BASELINE(field);
                            else
                                    hird = udev->l1_params.besl;
    
    The failing case is when disabling LPM. So it is sufficient to avoid
    access to udev->bos by moving the instruction into the "enable" clause.

    xhci: Convert xhci_handshake() to use readl_poll_timeout_atomic()
    
    commit f7fac17ca925faa03fc5eb854c081a24075f8bad upstream.
    
    Xhci_handshake() implements the algorithm already captured by
    readl_poll_timeout_atomic(). Convert the former to use the latter to
    avoid repetition.
    
    Turned out this patch also fixes a bug on the AMD Stoneyridge platform
    where usleep(1) sometimes takes over 10ms.
    This means a 5 second timeout can easily take over 15 seconds which will
    trigger the watchdog and reboot the system.

    xhci: update bounce buffer with correct sg num
    
    commit 597c56e372dab2c7f79b8d700aad3a5deebf9d1b upstream.
    
    This change fixes a data corruption issue occurred on USB hard disk for
    the case that bounce buffer is used during transferring data.
    
    While updating data between sg list and bounce buffer, current
    implementation passes mapped sg number (urb->num_mapped_sgs) to
    sg_pcopy_from_buffer() and sg_pcopy_to_buffer(). This causes data
    not get copied if target buffer is located in the elements after
    mapped sg elements. This change passes sg number for full list to
    fix issue.
    
    Besides, for copying data from bounce buffer, calling dma_unmap_single()
    on the bounce buffer before copying data to sg list can avoid cache issue.

    include/linux/bitops.h: sanitize rotate primitives
    
    commit ef4d6f6b275c498f8e5626c99dbeefdc5027f843 upstream.
    
    The ror32 implementation (word >> shift) | (word << (32 - shift) has
    undefined behaviour if shift is outside the [1, 31] range.  Similarly
    for the 64 bit variants.  Most callers pass a compile-time constant
    (naturally in that range), but there's an UBSAN report that these may
    actually be called with a shift count of 0.
    
    Instead of special-casing that, we can make them DTRT for all values of
    shift while also avoiding UB.  For some reason, this was already partly
    done for rol32 (which was well-defined for [0, 31]).  gcc 8 recognizes
    these patterns as rotates, so for example
    
      __u32 rol32(__u32 word, unsigned int shift)
      {
            return (word << (shift & 31)) | (word >> ((-shift) & 31));
      }
    
    compiles to
    
    0000000000000020 <rol32>:
      20:   89 f8                   mov    %edi,%eax
      22:   89 f1                   mov    %esi,%ecx
      24:   d3 c0                   rol    %cl,%eax
      26:   c3                      retq
    
    Older compilers unfortunately do not do as well, but this only affects
    the small minority of users that don't pass constants.
    
    Due to integer promotions, ro[lr]8 were already well-defined for shifts
    in [0, 8], and ro[lr]16 were mostly well-defined for shifts in [0, 16]
    (only mostly - u16 gets promoted to _signed_ int, so if bit 15 is set,
    word << 16 is undefined).  For consistency, update those as well.

    Previously, %g2 would end up with the value PAGE_SIZE, but after the
    commit mentioned below it ends up with the value 1 due to being reused
    for a different purpose. We need it to be PAGE_SIZE as we use it to step
    through pages in our demap loop, otherwise we set different flags in the
    low 12 bits of the address written to, thereby doing things other than a
    nucleus page flush.

    tipc: fix modprobe tipc failed after switch order of device registration
    
    commit 526f5b851a96566803ee4bee60d0a34df56c77f8 upstream.
    
    Error message printed:
    modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'tipc': Address family not
    supported by protocol.
    when modprobe tipc after the following patch: switch order of
    device registration, commit 7e27e8d6130c
    ("tipc: switch order of device registration to fix a crash")
    
    Because sock_create_kern(net, AF_TIPC, ...) called by
    tipc_topsrv_create_listener() in the initialization process
    of tipc_init_net(), so tipc_socket_init() must be execute before that.
    Meanwhile, tipc_net_id need to be initialized when sock_create()
    called, and tipc_socket_init() is no need to be called for each namespace.
    
    I add a variable tipc_topsrv_net_ops, and split the
    register_pernet_subsys() of tipc into two parts, and split
    tipc_socket_init() with initialization of pernet params.
    
    By the way, I fixed resources rollback error when tipc_bcast_init()
    failed in tipc_init_net().

    xen/pciback: Don't disable PCI_COMMAND on PCI device reset.
    
    commit 7681f31ec9cdacab4fd10570be924f2cef6669ba upstream.
    
    There is no need for this at all. Worst it means that if
    the guest tries to write to BARs it could lead (on certain
    platforms) to PCI SERR errors.
    
    Please note that with af6fc858a35b90e89ea7a7ee58e66628c55c776b
    "xen-pciback: limit guest control of command register"
    a guest is still allowed to enable those control bits (safely), but
    is not allowed to disable them and that therefore a well behaved
    frontend which enables things before using them will still
    function correctly.
    
    This is done via an write to the configuration register 0x4 which
    triggers on the backend side:
    command_write
      \- pci_enable_device
         \- pci_enable_device_flags
            \- do_pci_enable_device
               \- pcibios_enable_device
                  \-pci_enable_resourcess
                    [which enables the PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY|PCI_COMMAND_IO]
    
    However guests (and drivers) which don't do this could cause
    problems, including the security issues which XSA-120 sought
    to address.

    crypto: vmx - ghash: do nosimd fallback manually
    
    commit 357d065a44cdd77ed5ff35155a989f2a763e96ef upstream.
    
    VMX ghash was using a fallback that did not support interleaving simd
    and nosimd operations, leading to failures in the extended test suite.
    
    If I understood correctly, Eric's suggestion was to use the same
    data format that the generic code uses, allowing us to call into it
    with the same contexts. I wasn't able to get that to work - I think
    there's a very different key structure and data layout being used.
    
    So instead steal the arm64 approach and perform the fallback
    operations directly if required.

    [ Upstream commit 296d5b54163964b7ae536b8b57dfbd21d4e868e1 ]
    
    For every RX packet, the driver replenishes all buffers used for that
    packet and puts them back into the RX ring and RX aggregation ring.
    In one code path where the RX packet has one RX buffer and one or more
    aggregation buffers, we missed recycling the aggregation buffer(s) if
    we are unable to allocate a new SKB buffer.  This leads to the
    aggregation ring slowly running out of buffers over time.  Fix it
    by properly recycling the aggregation buffers.

    tipc: Avoid copying bytes beyond the supplied data
    
    TLV_SET is called with a data pointer and a len parameter that tells us
    how many bytes are pointed to by data. When invoking memcpy() we need
    to careful to only copy len bytes.
    
    Previously we would copy TLV_LENGTH(len) bytes which would copy an extra
    4 bytes past the end of the data pointer which newer GCC versions
    complain about.
    
     In file included from test.c:17:
     In function 'TLV_SET',
         inlined from 'test' at test.c:186:5:
     /usr/include/linux/tipc_config.h:317:3:
     warning: 'memcpy' forming offset [33, 36] is out of the bounds [0, 32]
     of object 'bearer_name' with type 'char[32]' [-Warray-bounds]
         memcpy(TLV_DATA(tlv_ptr), data, tlv_len);

     'bearer_name' declared here
         char bearer_name[TIPC_MAX_BEARER_NAME];
              ^~~~~~~~~~~
    
    We still want to ensure any padding bytes at the end are initialised, do
    this with a explicit memset() rather than copy bytes past the end of
    data. Apply the same logic to TCM_SET.

    The crash happens roughly 125..130ms after the disconnect. This
    correlates with the 'delay' timer that is started on certain USB tx/rx
    errors in the URB completion handler.
    
    The problem is a race of usbnet_stop() with usbnet_start_xmit(). In
    usbnet_stop() we call usbnet_terminate_urbs() to cancel all URBs in
    flight. This only makes sense if no new URBs are submitted
    concurrently, though. But the usbnet_start_xmit() can run at the same
    time on another CPU which almost unconditionally submits an URB. The
    error callback of the new URB will then schedule the timer after it was
    already stopped.
    
    The fix adds a check if the tx queue is stopped after the tx list lock
    has been taken. This should reliably prevent the submission of new URBs
    while usbnet_terminate_urbs() does its job. The same thing is done on
    the rx side even though it might be safe due to other flags that are
    checked there.

    removed the reset gpio free, when the driver is unbinded or rmmod,
    we miss the gpio free.
    
    This patch uses managed API to request the reset gpio, so that the
    gpio could be freed properly.

    net-gro: fix use-after-free read in napi_gro_frags()
    
    [ Upstream commit a4270d6795b0580287453ea55974d948393e66ef ]
    
    If a network driver provides to napi_gro_frags() an
    skb with a page fragment of exactly 14 bytes, the call
    to gro_pull_from_frag0() will 'consume' the fragment
    by calling skb_frag_unref(skb, 0), and the page might
    be freed and reused.
    
    Reading eth->h_proto at the end of napi_frags_skb() might
    read mangled data, or crash under specific debugging features.

    ipv6: Consider sk_bound_dev_if when binding a raw socket to an address
    
    [ Upstream commit 72f7cfab6f93a8ea825fab8ccfb016d064269f7f ]
    
    IPv6 does not consider if the socket is bound to a device when binding
    to an address. The result is that a socket can be bound to eth0 and
    then bound to the address of eth1. If the device is a VRF, the result
    is that a socket can only be bound to an address in the default VRF.
    
    Resolve by considering the device if sk_bound_dev_if is set.
