    powerpc: Make sure "cache" directory is removed when offlining cpu
    
    commit 91b973f90c1220d71923e7efe1e61f5329806380 upstream.
    
    The code in remove_cache_dir() is supposed to remove the "cache"
    subdirectory from the sysfs directory for a CPU when that CPU is
    being offlined.  It tries to do this by calling kobject_put() on
    the kobject for the subdirectory.  However, the subdirectory only
    gets removed once the last reference goes away, and the reference
    being put here may well not be the last reference.  That means
    that the "cache" subdirectory may still exist when the offlining
    operation has finished.  If the same CPU subsequently gets onlined,
    the code tries to add a new "cache" subdirectory.  If the old
    subdirectory has not yet been removed, we get a WARN_ON in the
    sysfs code, with stack trace, and an error message printed on the
    console.  Further, we ultimately end up with an online cpu with no
    "cache" subdirectory.
    
    This fixes it by doing an explicit kobject_del() at the point where
    we want the subdirectory to go away.  kobject_del() removes the sysfs
    directory even though the object still exists in memory.  The object
    will get freed at some point in the future.  A subsequent onlining
    operation can create a new sysfs directory, even if the old object
    still exists in memory, without causing any problems.

    target/iscsi: Fix network portal creation race
    
    commit ee291e63293146db64668e8d65eb35c97e8324f4 upstream.
    
    When creating network portals rapidly, such as when restoring a
    configuration, LIO's code to reuse existing portals can return a false
    negative if the thread hasn't run yet and set np_thread_state to
    ISCSI_NP_THREAD_ACTIVE. This causes an error in the network stack
    when attempting to bind to the same address/port.
    
    This patch sets NP_THREAD_ACTIVE before the np is placed on g_np_list,
    so even if the thread hasn't run yet, iscsit_get_np will return the
    existing np.
    
    Also, convert np_lock -> np_mutex + hold across adding new net portal
    to g_np_list to prevent a race where two threads may attempt to create
    the same network portal, resulting in one of them failing.

    SCSI: bfa: Chinook quad port 16G FC HBA claim issue
    
    commit dcaf9aed995c2b2a49fb86bbbcfa2f92c797ab5d upstream.
    
    Bfa driver crash is observed while pushing the firmware on to chinook
    quad port card due to uninitialized bfi_image_ct2 access which gets
    initialized only for CT2 ASIC based cards after request_firmware().
    For quard port chinook (CT2 ASIC based), bfi_image_ct2 is not getting
    initialized as there is no check for chinook PCI device ID before
    request_firmware and instead bfi_image_cb is initialized as it is the
    default case for card type check.
    
    This patch includes changes to read the right firmware for quad port chinook.

    usb: core: get config and string descriptors for unauthorized devices
    
    commit 83e83ecb79a8225e79bc8e54e9aff3e0e27658a2 upstream.
    
    There is no need to skip querying the config and string descriptors for
    unauthorized WUSB devices when usb_new_device is called.  It is allowed
    by WUSB spec.  The only action that needs to be delayed until
    authorization time is the set config.  This change allows user mode
    tools to see the config and string descriptors earlier in enumeration
    which is needed for some WUSB devices to function properly on Android
    systems.  It also reduces the amount of divergent code paths needed
    for WUSB devices.

    KVM: x86: Fix potential divide by 0 in lapic (CVE-2013-6367)
    
    commit b963a22e6d1a266a67e9eecc88134713fd54775c upstream.
    
    Under guest controllable circumstances apic_get_tmcct will execute a
    divide by zero and cause a crash.  If the guest cpuid support
    tsc deadline timers and performs the following sequence of requests
    the host will crash.
    - Set the mode to periodic
    - Set the TMICT to 0
    - Set the mode bits to 11 (neither periodic, nor one shot, nor tsc deadline)
    - Set the TMICT to non-zero.
    Then the lapic_timer.period will be 0, but the TMICT will not be.  If the
    guest then reads from the TMCCT then the host will perform a divide by 0.
    
    This patch ensures that if the lapic_timer.period is 0, then the division
    does not occur.

    net: avoid reference counter overflows on fib_rules in multicast forwarding
    
    [ Upstream commit 95f4a45de1a0f172b35451fc52283290adb21f6e ]
    
    Bob Falken reported that after 4G packets, multicast forwarding stopped
    working. This was because of a rule reference counter overflow which
    freed the rule as soon as the overflow happend.
    
    This patch solves this by adding the FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF flag to
    fib_rules_lookup calls. This is safe even from non-rcu locked sections
    as in this case the flag only implies not taking a reference to the rule,
    which we don't need at all.
    
    Rules only hold references to the namespace, which are guaranteed to be
    available during the call of the non-rcu protected function reg_vif_xmit
    because of the interface reference which itself holds a reference to
    the net namespace.

    inet_diag: fix inet_diag_dump_icsk() timewait socket state logic
    
    [ Based upon upstream commit 70315d22d3c7383f9a508d0aab21e2eb35b2303a ]
    
    Fix inet_diag_dump_icsk() to reflect the fact that both TIME_WAIT and
    FIN_WAIT2 connections are represented by inet_timewait_sock (not just
    TIME_WAIT). Thus:
    
    (a) We need to iterate through the time_wait buckets if the user wants
    either TIME_WAIT or FIN_WAIT2. (Before fixing this, "ss -nemoi state
    fin-wait-2" would not return any sockets, even if there were some in
    FIN_WAIT2.)
    
    (b) We need to check tw_substate to see if the user wants to dump
    sockets in the particular substate (TIME_WAIT or FIN_WAIT2) that a
    given connection is in. (Before fixing this, "ss -nemoi state
    time-wait" would actually return sockets in state FIN_WAIT2.)
    
    An analogous fix is in v3.13: 70315d22d3c7383f9a508d0aab21e2eb35b2303a
    ("inet_diag: fix inet_diag_dump_icsk() to use correct state for
    timewait sockets") but that patch is quite different because 3.13 code
    is very different in this area due to the unification of TCP hash
    tables in 05dbc7b ("tcp/dccp: remove twchain") in v3.13-rc1.
    
    I tested that this applies cleanly between v3.3 and v3.12, and tested
    that it works in both 3.3 and 3.12. It does not apply cleanly to 3.2
    and earlier (though it makes semantic sense), and semantically is not
    the right fix for 3.13 and beyond (as mentioned above).

    bnx2x: fix DMA unmapping of TSO split BDs
    
    [ Upstream commit 95e92fd40c967c363ad66b2fd1ce4dcd68132e54 ]
    
    bnx2x triggers warnings with CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG=y:
    
      WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2253 at lib/dma-debug.c:887 check_unmap+0xf8/0x920()
      bnx2x 0000:28:00.0: DMA-API: device driver frees DMA memory with
      different size [device address=0x00000000da2b389e] [map size=1490 bytes]
      [unmap size=66 bytes]
    
    The reason is that bnx2x splits a TSO BD into two BDs (headers + data)
    using one DMA mapping for both, but it uses only the length of the first
    BD when unmapping.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by unmapping the whole length of the two BDs.

    allocations via dma_alloc_coherent() with the limited DMA mask bits
    may fail more frequently, ended up with no available buffers, when

    much more chance to obtain such pages.

    parport: parport_pc: remove double PCI ID for NetMos
    
    commit d6a484520c5572a4170fa915109ccfc0c38f5008 upstream.
    
    In commit 85747f ("PATCH] parport: add NetMOS 9805 support") Max added
    the PCI ID for NetMOS 9805 based on a Debian bug report from 2k4 which
    was at the v2.4.26 time frame. The patch made into 2.6.14.
    Shortly before that patch akpm merged commit 296d3c783b ("[PATCH] Support
    NetMOS based PCI cards providing serial and parallel ports") which made
    into v2.6.9-rc1.
    Now we have two different entries for the same PCI id.
    I have here the NetMos 9805 which claims to support SPP/EPP/ECP mode.
    This patch takes Max's entry for titan_1284p1 (base != -1 specifies the
    ioport for ECP mode) and replaces akpm's entry for netmos_9805 which
    specified -1 (=none). Both share the same PCI-ID (my card has subsystem
    0x1000 / 0x0020 so it should match PCI_ANY).
    
    While here I also drop the entry for titan_1284p2 which is the same as
    netmos_9815.

    commit 8f248dae133668bfb8e9379b4b3f0571c858b24a upstream.
    
    byBBPreEDIndex value is initially 0, this means that from
    cold BBvUpdatePreEDThreshold is never set.
    
    This means that sensitivity may be in an ambiguous state,
    failing to scan any wireless points or at least distant ones.

    b43: Fix lockdep splat
    
    commit 09164043f63c947a49797750a09ca1cd7c31108e upstream.
    
    In https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67561, a locking dependency is reported
    when b43 is used with hostapd, and rfkill is used to kill the radio output.
    
    The lockdep splat (in part) is as follows:
    
    ======================================================
    [ INFO: possible circular locking dependency detected ]
    3.12.0 #1 Not tainted
    -------------------------------------------------------
    rfkill/10040 is trying to acquire lock:
     (rtnl_mutex){+.+.+.}, at: [<ffffffff8146f282>] rtnl_lock+0x12/0x20
    
    but task is already holding lock:
     (rfkill_global_mutex){+.+.+.}, at: [<ffffffffa04832ca>] rfkill_fop_write+0x6a/0x170 [rfkill]
    
    --snip--
    
    Chain exists of:
      rtnl_mutex --> misc_mtx --> rfkill_global_mutex
    
    The fix is to move the initialization of the hardware random number generator
    outside the code range covered by the rtnl_mutex.

    USB: Nokia 502 is an unusual device
    
    commit 0e16114f2db4838251fb64f3b550996ad3585890 upstream.
    
    The USB storage operation of Nokia Asha 502 Dual SIM smartphone running Asha
    Platform 1.1.1 is unreliable in respect of data consistency (i.e. transfered
    files are corrupted). A similar issue is described here:
    http://discussions.nokia.com/t5/Asha-and-other-Nokia-Series-30/Nokia-301-USB-transfers-and-corrupted-files/td-p/1974170
    
    The workaround is (MAX_SECTORS_64):
       rmmod usb_storage && modprobe usb_storage quirks=0421:06aa:m
    
    The patch adds the tested device to the unusual list permanently.

    x86, x32: Correct invalid use of user timespec in the kernel
    
    commit 2def2ef2ae5f3990aabdbe8a755911902707d268 upstream.
    
    The x32 case for the recvmsg() timout handling is broken:
    
      asmlinkage long compat_sys_recvmmsg(int fd, struct compat_mmsghdr __user *mmsg,
                                          unsigned int vlen, unsigned int flags,
                                          struct compat_timespec __user *timeout)
      {
              int datagrams;
              struct timespec ktspec;
    
              if (flags & MSG_CMSG_COMPAT)
                      return -EINVAL;
    
              if (COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME)
                      return __sys_recvmmsg(fd, (struct mmsghdr __user *)mmsg, vlen,
                                            flags | MSG_CMSG_COMPAT,
                                            (struct timespec *) timeout);
              ...
    
    The timeout pointer parameter is provided by userland (hence the __user
    annotation) but for x32 syscalls it's simply cast to a kernel pointer
    and is passed to __sys_recvmmsg which will eventually directly
    dereference it for both reading and writing.  Other callers to
    __sys_recvmmsg properly copy from userland to the kernel first.
    
    The bug was introduced by commit ee4fa23c4bfc ("compat: Use
    COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME in net/compat.c") and should affect all kernels
    since 3.4 (and perhaps vendor kernels if they backported x32 support
    along with this code).
    
    Note that CONFIG_X86_X32_ABI gets enabled at build time and only if
    CONFIG_X86_X32 is enabled and ld can build x32 executables.
    
    Other uses of COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME seem fine.
    
    This addresses CVE-2014-0038.

    mm: hugetlbfs: fix hugetlbfs optimization
    
    commit 27c73ae759774e63313c1fbfeb17ba076cea64c5 upstream.
    
    Commit 7cb2ef56e6a8 ("mm: fix aio performance regression for database
    caused by THP") can cause dereference of a dangling pointer if
    split_huge_page runs during PageHuge() if there are updates to the
    tail_page->private field.
    
    Also it is repeating compound_head twice for hugetlbfs and it is running
    compound_head+compound_trans_head for THP when a single one is needed in
    both cases.
    
    The new code within the PageSlab() check doesn't need to verify that the
    THP page size is never bigger than the smallest hugetlbfs page size, to
    avoid memory corruption.
    
    A longstanding theoretical race condition was found while fixing the
    above (see the change right after the skip_unlock label, that is
    relevant for the compound_lock path too).
    
    By re-establishing the _mapcount tail refcounting for all compound
    pages, this also fixes the below problem:
    
      echo 0 >/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages

    md/raid5: fix long-standing problem with bitmap handling on write failure.
    
    commit 9f97e4b128d2ea90a5f5063ea0ee3b0911f4c669 upstream.
    
    Before a write starts we set a bit in the write-intent bitmap.
    When the write completes we clear that bit if the write was successful
    to all devices.  However if the write wasn't fully successful we
    should not clear the bit.  If the faulty drive is subsequently
    re-added, the fact that the bit is still set ensure that we will
    re-write the data that is missing.
    
    This logic is mediated by the STRIPE_DEGRADED flag - we only clear the
    bitmap bit when this flag is not set.
    Currently we correctly set the flag if a write starts when some
    devices are failed or missing.  But we do *not* set the flag if some
    device failed during the write attempt.
    This is wrong and can result in clearing the bit inappropriately.
    
    So: set the flag when a write fails.
    
    This bug has been present since bitmaps were introduces, so the fix is
    suitable for any -stable kernel.
