    USB: XHCI: fix memory leak of URB-private data
    
    commit 48c3375c5f69b1c2ef3d1051a0009cb9bce0ce24 upstream.
    
    This patch (as1640) fixes a memory leak in xhci-hcd.  The urb_priv
    data structure isn't always deallocated in the handle_tx_event()
    routine for non-control transfers.  The patch adds a kfree() call so
    that all paths end up freeing the memory properly.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.36, that
    contain the commit 8e51adccd4c4b9ffcd509d7f2afce0a906139f75 "USB: xHCI:
    Introduce urb_priv structure"

    xhci: Fix isoc TD encoding.
    
    commit 760973d2a74b93eb1697981f7448f0e62767cfc4 upstream.
    
    An isochronous TD is comprised of one isochronous TRB chained to zero or
    more normal TRBs.  Only the isoc TRB has the TBC and TLBPC fields.  The
    normal TRBs must set those fields to zeroes.  The code was setting the
    TBC and TLBPC fields for both isoc and normal TRBs.  Fix this.
    
    This should be backported to stable kernels as old as 3.0, that contain
    the commit b61d378f2da41c748aba6ca19d77e1e1c02bcea5 " xhci 1.0: Set

    USB: EHCI: fix bug in scheduling periodic split transfers
    
    commit 3e619d04159be54b3daa0b7036b0ce9e067f4b5d upstream.
    
    This patch (as1654) fixes a very old bug in ehci-hcd, connected with
    scheduling of periodic split transfers.  The calculations for
    full/low-speed bus usage are all carried out after the correction for
    bit-stuffing has been applied, but the values in the max_tt_usecs
    array assume it hasn't been.  The array should allow for allocation of
    up to 90% of the bus capacity, which is 900 us, not 780 us.
    
    The symptom caused by this bug is that any isochronous transfer to a
    full-speed device with a maxpacket size larger than about 980 bytes is
    always rejected with a -ENOSPC error.

    nilfs2: fix fix very long mount time issue
    
    commit a9bae189542e71f91e61a4428adf6e5a7dfe8063 upstream.
    
    There exists a situation when GC can work in background alone without
    any other filesystem activity during significant time.
    
    The nilfs_clean_segments() method calls nilfs_segctor_construct() that
    updates superblocks in the case of NILFS_SC_SUPER_ROOT and
    THE_NILFS_DISCONTINUED flags are set.  But when GC is working alone the
    nilfs_clean_segments() is called with unset THE_NILFS_DISCONTINUED flag.
    As a result, the update of superblocks doesn't occurred all this time
    and in the case of SPOR superblocks keep very old values of last super
    root placement.
    
    SYMPTOMS:
    
    Trying to mount a NILFS2 volume after SPOR in such environment ends with
    very long mounting time (it can achieve about several hours in some
    cases).
    
    REPRODUCING PATH:
    
    1. It needs to use external USB HDD, disable automount and doesn't
       make any additional filesystem activity on the NILFS2 volume.
    
    2. Generate temporary file with size about 100 - 500 GB (for example,
       dd if=/dev/zero of=<file_name> bs=1073741824 count=200).  The size of
       file defines duration of GC working.
    
    3. Then it needs to delete file.
    
    4. Start GC manually by means of command "nilfs-clean -p 0".  When you
       start GC by means of such way then, at the end, superblocks is updated
       by once.  So, for simulation of SPOR, it needs to wait sometime (15 -
       40 minutes) and simply switch off USB HDD manually.
    
    5. Switch on USB HDD again and try to mount NILFS2 volume.  As a
       result, NILFS2 volume will mount during very long time.
    
    REPRODUCIBILITY: 100%
    
    FIX:
    
    This patch adds checking that superblocks need to update and set
    THE_NILFS_DISCONTINUED flag before nilfs_clean_segments() call.

    x86-64: Replace left over sti/cli in ia32 audit exit code
    
    commit 40a1ef95da85843696fc3ebe5fce39b0db32669f upstream.
    
    For some reason they didn't get replaced so far by their
    paravirt equivalents, resulting in code to be run with
    interrupts disabled that doesn't expect so (causing, in the
    observed case, a BUG_ON() to trigger) when syscall auditing is
    enabled.
    
    David (Cc-ed) came up with an identical fix, so likely this can
    be taken to count as an ack from him.
