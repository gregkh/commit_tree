    ipmi:ssif: Fix handling of multi-part return messages
    
    commit 7d6380cd40f7993f75c4bde5b36f6019237e8719 upstream.
    
    The block number was not being compared right, it was off by one
    when checking the response.
    
    Some statistics wouldn't be incremented properly in some cases.
    
    Check to see if that middle-part messages always have 31 bytes of
    data.

    net: speed up skb_rbtree_purge()
    
    commit 7c90584c66cc4b033a3b684b0e0950f79e7b7166 upstream.
    
    As measured in my prior patch ("sch_netem: faster rb tree removal"),
    rbtree_postorder_for_each_entry_safe() is nice looking but much slower
    than using rb_next() directly, except when tree is small enough
    to fit in CPU caches (then the cost is the same)
    
    Also note that there is not even an increase of text size :
    $ size net/core/skbuff.o.before net/core/skbuff.o
       text    data     bss     dec     hex filename

    mm, proc: be more verbose about unstable VMA flags in /proc/<pid>/smaps
    
    [ Upstream commit 7550c6079846a24f30d15ac75a941c8515dbedfb ]
    
    Patch series "THP eligibility reporting via proc".
    
    This series of three patches aims at making THP eligibility reporting much
    more robust and long term sustainable.  The trigger for the change is a
    regression report [2] and the long follow up discussion.  In short the
    specific application didn't have good API to query whether a particular
    mapping can be backed by THP so it has used VMA flags to workaround that.
    These flags represent a deep internal state of VMAs and as such they
    should be used by userspace with a great deal of caution.
    
    A similar has happened for [3] when users complained that VM_MIXEDMAP is
    no longer set on DAX mappings.  Again a lack of a proper API led to an
    abuse.
    
    The first patch in the series tries to emphasise that that the semantic of
    flags might change and any application consuming those should be really
    careful.
    
    The remaining two patches provide a more suitable interface to address [2]
    and provide a consistent API to query the THP status both for each VMA and
    process wide as well.  [1]
    
    http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20181120103515.25280-1-mhocko@kernel.org [2]
    http://lkml.kernel.org/r/http://lkml.kernel.org/r/alpine.DEB.2.21.1809241054050.224429@chino.kir.corp.google.com
    [3] http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20181002100531.GC4135@quack2.suse.cz
    
    This patch (of 3):
    
    Even though vma flags exported via /proc/<pid>/smaps are explicitly
    documented to be not guaranteed for future compatibility the warning
    doesn't go far enough because it doesn't mention semantic changes to those
    flags.  And they are important as well because these flags are a deep
    implementation internal to the MM code and the semantic might change at
    any time.
    
    Let's consider two recent examples:
    http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20181002100531.GC4135@quack2.suse.cz
    : commit e1fb4a086495 "dax: remove VM_MIXEDMAP for fsdax and device dax" has
    : removed VM_MIXEDMAP flag from DAX VMAs. Now our testing shows that in the
    : mean time certain customer of ours started poking into /proc/<pid>/smaps
    : and looks at VMA flags there and if VM_MIXEDMAP is missing among the VMA
    : flags, the application just fails to start complaining that DAX support is
    : missing in the kernel.
    
    http://lkml.kernel.org/r/alpine.DEB.2.21.1809241054050.224429@chino.kir.corp.google.com
    : Commit 1860033237d4 ("mm: make PR_SET_THP_DISABLE immediately active")
    : introduced a regression in that userspace cannot always determine the set
    : of vmas where thp is ineligible.
    : Userspace relies on the "nh" flag being emitted as part of /proc/pid/smaps
    : to determine if a vma is eligible to be backed by hugepages.
    : Previous to this commit, prctl(PR_SET_THP_DISABLE, 1) would cause thp to
    : be disabled and emit "nh" as a flag for the corresponding vmas as part of
    : /proc/pid/smaps.  After the commit, thp is disabled by means of an mm
    : flag and "nh" is not emitted.
    : This causes smaps parsing libraries to assume a vma is eligible for thp
    : and ends up puzzling the user on why its memory is not backed by thp.
    
    In both cases userspace was relying on a semantic of a specific VMA flag.
    The primary reason why that happened is a lack of a proper interface.
    While this has been worked on and it will be fixed properly, it seems that
    our wording could see some refinement and be more vocal about semantic
    aspect of these flags as well.

    mm/page-writeback.c: don't break integrity writeback on ->writepage() error
    
    [ Upstream commit 3fa750dcf29e8606e3969d13d8e188cc1c0f511d ]
    
    write_cache_pages() is used in both background and integrity writeback
    scenarios by various filesystems.  Background writeback is mostly
    concerned with cleaning a certain number of dirty pages based on various
    mm heuristics.  It may not write the full set of dirty pages or wait for
    I/O to complete.  Integrity writeback is responsible for persisting a set
    of dirty pages before the writeback job completes.  For example, an
    fsync() call must perform integrity writeback to ensure data is on disk
    before the call returns.
    
    write_cache_pages() unconditionally breaks out of its processing loop in
    the event of a ->writepage() error.  This is fine for background
    writeback, which had no strict requirements and will eventually come
    around again.  This can cause problems for integrity writeback on
    filesystems that might need to clean up state associated with failed page
    writeouts.  For example, XFS performs internal delayed allocation
    accounting before returning a ->writepage() error, where applicable.  If
    the current writeback happens to be associated with an unmount and
    write_cache_pages() completes the writeback prematurely due to error, the
    filesystem is unmounted in an inconsistent state if dirty+delalloc pages
    still exist.
    
    To handle this problem, update write_cache_pages() to always process the
    full set of pages for integrity writeback regardless of ->writepage()
    errors.  Save the first encountered error and return it to the caller once
    complete.  This facilitates XFS (or any other fs that expects integrity
    writeback to process the entire set of dirty pages) to clean up its
    internal state completely in the event of persistent mapping errors.
    Background writeback continues to exit on the first error encountered.

    ocfs2: fix panic due to unrecovered local alloc
    
    [ Upstream commit 532e1e54c8140188e192348c790317921cb2dc1c ]
    
    mount.ocfs2 ignore the inconsistent error that journal is clean but
    local alloc is unrecovered.  After mount, local alloc not empty, then
    reserver cluster didn't alloc a new local alloc window, reserveration
    map is empty(ocfs2_reservation_map.m_bitmap_len = 0), that triggered the
    following panic.
    
    This issue was reported at
    
      https://oss.oracle.com/pipermail/ocfs2-devel/2015-May/010854.html
    
    and was advised to fixed during mount.  But this is a very unusual
    inconsistent state, usually journal dirty flag should be cleared at the
    last stage of umount until every other things go right.  We may need do
    further debug to check that.  Any way to avoid possible futher
    corruption, mount should be abort and fsck should be run.

    This is because when populating Driver Map using firmware raid map, all
    non-existing VDs set their ldTgtIdToLd to 0xff, so it can be skipped later.
    
    From drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas_base.c ,
    memset(instance->ld_ids, 0xff, MEGASAS_MAX_LD_IDS);
    
    From drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas_fp.c ,
    /* For non existing VDs, iterate to next VD*/
    if (ld >= (MAX_LOGICAL_DRIVES_EXT - 1))
            continue;
    
    However, there are a few places that failed to skip those non-existing VDs
    due to off-by-one errors. Then, those 0xff leaked into MR_LdRaidGet(0xff,
    map) and triggered the out-of-bound accesses.

    sysfs: Disable lockdep for driver bind/unbind files
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f4b374332ec0ae9c738ff8ec9bed5cd97ff9adc ]
    
    This is the much more correct fix for my earlier attempt at:
    
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/12/10/118
    
    Short recap:
    
    - There's not actually a locking issue, it's just lockdep being a bit
      too eager to complain about a possible deadlock.
    
    - Contrary to what I claimed the real problem is recursion on
      kn->count. Greg pointed me at sysfs_break_active_protection(), used
      by the scsi subsystem to allow a sysfs file to unbind itself. That
      would be a real deadlock, which isn't what's happening here. Also,
      breaking the active protection means we'd need to manually handle
      all the lifetime fun.
    
    - With Rafael we discussed the task_work approach, which kinda works,
      but has two downsides: It's a functional change for a lockdep
      annotation issue, and it won't work for the bind file (which needs
      to get the errno from the driver load function back to userspace).
    
    - Greg also asked why this never showed up: To hit this you need to
      unregister a 2nd driver from the unload code of your first driver. I
      guess only gpus do that. The bug has always been there, but only
      with a recent patch series did we add more locks so that lockdep
      built a chain from unbinding the snd-hda driver to the
      acpi_video_unregister call.
    
    Full lockdep splat:

    Looking around I've noticed that usb and i2c already handle similar

    sysfs somewhere else in the hierarchy. Relevant commits are:

    ALSA: bebob: fix model-id of unit for Apogee Ensemble
    
    [ Upstream commit 644b2e97405b0b74845e1d3c2b4fe4c34858062b ]
    
    This commit fixes hard-coded model-id for an unit of Apogee Ensemble with
    a correct value. This unit uses DM1500 ASIC produced ArchWave AG (formerly
    known as BridgeCo AG).
    
    I note that this model supports three modes in the number of data channels
    in tx/rx streams; 8 ch pairs, 10 ch pairs, 18 ch pairs. The mode is
    switched by Vendor-dependent AV/C command, like:
    
    $ cd linux-firewire-utils
    $ ./firewire-request /dev/fw1 fcp 0x00ff000003dbeb0600000000 (8ch pairs)
    $ ./firewire-request /dev/fw1 fcp 0x00ff000003dbeb0601000000 (10ch pairs)
    $ ./firewire-request /dev/fw1 fcp 0x00ff000003dbeb0602000000 (18ch pairs)
    
    When switching between different mode, the unit disappears from IEEE 1394
    bus, then appears on the bus with different combination of stream formats.
    In a mode of 18 ch pairs, available sampling rate is up to 96.0 kHz, else
    up to 192.0 kHz.

    dm snapshot: Fix excessive memory usage and workqueue stalls
    
    [ Upstream commit 721b1d98fb517ae99ab3b757021cf81db41e67be ]
    
    kcopyd has no upper limit to the number of jobs one can allocate and
    issue. Under certain workloads this can lead to excessive memory usage
    and workqueue stalls. For example, when creating multiple dm-snapshot
    targets with a 4K chunk size and then writing to the origin through the
    page cache. Syncing the page cache causes a large number of BIOs to be
    issued to the dm-snapshot origin target, which itself issues an even
    larger (because of the BIO splitting taking place) number of kcopyd
    jobs.
    
    Running the following test, from the device mapper test suite [1],
    
      dmtest run --suite snapshot -n many_snapshots_of_same_volume_N
    
    , with 8 active snapshots, results in the kcopyd job slab cache growing
    to 10G. Depending on the available system RAM this can lead to the OOM
    killer killing user processes:

    The root cause for these issues is the way dm-snapshot uses kcopyd. In
    particular, the lack of an explicit or implicit limit to the maximum
    number of in-flight COW jobs. The merging path is not affected because
    it implicitly limits the in-flight kcopyd jobs to one.
    
    Fix these issues by using a semaphore to limit the maximum number of
    in-flight kcopyd jobs. We grab the semaphore before allocating a new
    kcopyd job in start_copy() and start_full_bio() and release it after the
    job finishes in copy_callback().
    
    The initial semaphore value is configurable through a module parameter,
    to allow fine tuning the maximum number of in-flight COW jobs. Setting
    this parameter to zero initializes the semaphore to INT_MAX.
    
    A default value of 2048 maximum in-flight kcopyd jobs was chosen. This
    value was decided experimentally as a trade-off between memory
    consumption, stalling the kernel's workqueues and maintaining a high
    enough throughput.
    
    Re-running the aforementioned test:
    
      * Workqueue stalls are eliminated
      * kcopyd's job slab cache uses a maximum of 130MB
      * The time taken by the test to write to the snapshot-origin target is
        reduced from 05m20.48s to 03m26.38s

    dm kcopyd: Fix bug causing workqueue stalls
    
    [ Upstream commit d7e6b8dfc7bcb3f4f3a18313581f67486a725b52 ]
    
    When using kcopyd to run callbacks through dm_kcopyd_do_callback() or
    submitting copy jobs with a source size of 0, the jobs are pushed
    directly to the complete_jobs list, which could be under processing by
    the kcopyd thread. As a result, the kcopyd thread can continue running
    completed jobs indefinitely, without releasing the CPU, as long as
    someone keeps submitting new completed jobs through the aforementioned
    paths. Processing of work items, queued for execution on the same CPU as
    the currently running kcopyd thread, is thus stalled for excessive
    amounts of time, hurting performance.
    
    Running the following test, from the device mapper test suite [1],
    
      dmtest run --suite snapshot -n parallel_io_to_many_snaps_N
    
    , with 8 active snapshots, we get, in dmesg, messages like the
    following:

    Fix this by splitting the complete_jobs list into two parts: A user
    facing part, named callback_jobs, and one used internally by kcopyd,
    retaining the name complete_jobs. dm_kcopyd_do_callback() and
    dispatch_job() now push their jobs to the callback_jobs list, which is
    spliced to the complete_jobs list once, every time the kcopyd thread
    wakes up. This prevents kcopyd from hogging the CPU indefinitely and
    causing workqueue stalls.
    
    Re-running the aforementioned test:
    
      * Workqueue stalls are eliminated
      * The maximum writing time among all targets is reduced from 09m37.10s
        to 06m04.85s and the total run time of the test is reduced from
        10m43.591s to 7m19.199s

    perf svghelper: Fix unchecked usage of strncpy()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2f5302533f306d5ee87bd375aef9ca35b91762cb ]
    
    The strncpy() function may leave the destination string buffer
    unterminated, better use strlcpy() that we have a __weak fallback
    implementation for systems without it.
    
    In this specific case this would only happen if fgets() was buggy, as
    its man page states that it should read one less byte than the size of
    the destination buffer, so that it can put the nul byte at the end of
    it, so it would never copy 255 non-nul chars, as fgets reads into the
    orig buffer at most 254 non-nul chars and terminates it. But lets just
    switch to strlcpy to keep the original intent and silence the gcc 8.2
    warning.
    
    This fixes this warning on an Alpine Linux Edge system with gcc 8.2:
    
      In function 'cpu_model',
          inlined from 'svg_cpu_box' at util/svghelper.c:378:2:

    kconfig: fix memory leak when EOF is encountered in quotation
    
    [ Upstream commit fbac5977d81cb2b2b7e37b11c459055d9585273c ]
    
    An unterminated string literal followed by new line is passed to the
    parser (with "multi-line strings not supported" warning shown), then
    handled properly there.
    
    On the other hand, an unterminated string literal at end of file is
    never passed to the parser, then results in memory leak.
    
    [Test Code]
    
      ----------(Kconfig begin)----------
      source "Kconfig.inc"
    
      config A
              bool "a"
      -----------(Kconfig end)-----------

      Before the fix:
    
        LEAK SUMMARY:

    Eliminate the memory leak path by handling this case. Of course, such

    kconfig: fix file name and line number of warn_ignored_character()
    
    [ Upstream commit 77c1c0fa8b1477c5799bdad65026ea5ff676da44 ]
    
    Currently, warn_ignore_character() displays invalid file name and
    line number.
    
    The lexer should use current_file->name and yylineno, while the parser
    should use zconf_curname() and zconf_lineno().
    
    This difference comes from that the lexer is always going ahead
    of the parser. The parser needs to look ahead one token to make a
    shift/reduce decision, so the lexer is requested to scan more text
    from the input file.
    
    This commit fixes the warning message from warn_ignored_character().

    clk: imx6q: reset exclusive gates on init
    
    [ Upstream commit f7542d817733f461258fd3a47d77da35b2d9fc81 ]
    
    The exclusive gates may be set up in the wrong way by software running
    before the clock driver comes up. In that case the exclusive setup is
    locked in its initial state, as the complementary function can't be
    activated without disabling the initial setup first.
    
    To avoid this lock situation, reset the exclusive gates to the off
    state and allow the kernel to provide the proper setup.

    scsi: target: use consistent left-aligned ASCII INQUIRY data
    
    [ Upstream commit 0de263577de5d5e052be5f4f93334e63cc8a7f0b ]
    
    spc5r17.pdf specifies:
    
      4.3.1 ASCII data field requirements
      ASCII data fields shall contain only ASCII printable characters (i.e.,
      code values 20h to 7Eh) and may be terminated with one or more ASCII null
      (00h) characters.  ASCII data fields described as being left-aligned
      shall have any unused bytes at the end of the field (i.e., highest
      offset) and the unused bytes shall be filled with ASCII space characters
      (20h).
    
    LIO currently space-pads the T10 VENDOR IDENTIFICATION and PRODUCT
    IDENTIFICATION fields in the standard INQUIRY data. However, the PRODUCT
    REVISION LEVEL field in the standard INQUIRY data as well as the T10 VENDOR
    IDENTIFICATION field in the INQUIRY Device Identification VPD Page are
    zero-terminated/zero-padded.
    
    Fix this inconsistency by using space-padding for all of the above fields.

    net: call sk_dst_reset when set SO_DONTROUTE
    
    [ Upstream commit 0fbe82e628c817e292ff588cd5847fc935e025f2 ]
    
    after set SO_DONTROUTE to 1, the IP layer should not route packets if
    the dest IP address is not in link scope. But if the socket has cached
    the dst_entry, such packets would be routed until the sk_dst_cache
    expires. So we should clean the sk_dst_cache when a user set
    SO_DONTROUTE option. Below are server/client python scripts which
    could reprodue this issue:
    
    server side code:
    
    ==========================================================================
    import socket
    import struct
    import time
    
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.bind(('0.0.0.0', 9000))
    s.listen(1)
    sock, addr = s.accept()
    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_DONTROUTE, struct.pack('i', 1))
    while True:
        sock.send(b'foo')

    powerpc/pseries/cpuidle: Fix preempt warning
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b038cbc5fcf12a7ee1cc9bfd5da1e46dacdee87 ]
    
    When booting a pseries kernel with PREEMPT enabled, it dumps the
    following warning:
    
       BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: swapper/0/1

    This happens because the code calls get_lppaca() which calls
    get_paca() and it checks if preemption is disabled through
    check_preemption_disabled().
    
    Preemption should be disabled because the per CPU variable may make no
    sense if there is a preemption (and a CPU switch) after it reads the
    per CPU data and when it is used.
    
    In this device driver specifically, it is not a problem, because this
    code just needs to have access to one lppaca struct, and it does not
    matter if it is the current per CPU lppaca struct or not (i.e. when
    there is a preemption and a CPU migration).
    
    That said, the most appropriate fix seems to be related to avoiding
    the debug_smp_processor_id() call at get_paca(), instead of calling
    preempt_disable() before get_paca().

    pstore/ram: Do not treat empty buffers as valid
    
    [ Upstream commit 30696378f68a9e3dad6bfe55938b112e72af00c2 ]
    
    The ramoops backend currently calls persistent_ram_save_old() even
    if a buffer is empty. While this appears to work, it is does not seem
    like the right thing to do and could lead to future bugs so lets avoid
    that. It also prevents misleading prints in the logs which claim the
    buffer is valid.
    
    I got something like:
    
            found existing buffer, size 0, start 0
    
    When I was expecting:
    
            no valid data in buffer (sig = ...)
    
    This bails out early (and reports with pr_debug()), since it's an
    acceptable state.

    jffs2: Fix use of uninitialized delayed_work, lockdep breakage
    
    [ Upstream commit a788c5272769ddbcdbab297cf386413eeac04463 ]
    
    jffs2_sync_fs makes the assumption that if CONFIG_JFFS2_FS_WRITEBUFFER
    is defined then a write buffer is available and has been initialized.
    However, this does is not the case when the mtd device has no
    out-of-band buffer:
    
    int jffs2_nand_flash_setup(struct jffs2_sb_info *c)
    {
            if (!c->mtd->oobsize)
                    return 0;
    ...
    
    The resulting call to cancel_delayed_work_sync passing a uninitialized
    (but zeroed) delayed_work struct forces lockdep to become disabled.

    MIPS: SiByte: Enable swiotlb for SWARM, LittleSur and BigSur
    
    [ Upstream commit e4849aff1e169b86c561738daf8ff020e9de1011 ]
    
    The Broadcom SiByte BCM1250, BCM1125, and BCM1125H SOCs have an onchip
    DRAM controller that supports memory amounts of up to 16GiB, and due to
    how the address decoder has been wired in the SOC any memory beyond 1GiB
    is actually mapped starting from 4GiB physical up, that is beyond the
    32-bit addressable limit[1].  Consequently if the maximum amount of
    memory has been installed, then it will span up to 19GiB.
    
    Many of the evaluation boards we support that are based on one of these
    SOCs have their memory soldered and the amount present fits in the
    32-bit address range.  The BCM91250A SWARM board however has actual DIMM
    slots and accepts, depending on the peripherals revision of the SOC, up
    to 4GiB or 8GiB of memory in commercially available JEDEC modules[2].
    I believe this is also the case with the BCM91250C2 LittleSur board.
    This means that up to either 3GiB or 7GiB of memory requires 64-bit
    addressing to access.
    
    I believe the BCM91480B BigSur board, which has the BCM1480 SOC instead,
    accepts at least as much memory, although I have no documentation or
    actual hardware available to verify that.
    
    Both systems have PCI slots installed for use by any PCI option boards,
    including ones that only support 32-bit addressing (additionally the
    32-bit PCI host bridge of the BCM1250, BCM1125, and BCM1125H SOCs limits
    addressing to 32-bits), and there is no IOMMU available.  Therefore for
    PCI DMA to work in the presence of memory beyond enable swiotlb for the
    affected systems.
    
    All the other SOC onchip DMA devices use 40-bit addressing and therefore
    can address the whole memory, so only enable swiotlb if PCI support and
    support for DMA beyond 4GiB have been both enabled in the configuration
    of the kernel.
    
    This shows up as follows:

    writeback: don't decrement wb->refcnt if !wb->bdi
    
    [ Upstream commit 347a28b586802d09604a149c1a1f6de5dccbe6fa ]
    
    This happened while running in qemu-system-aarch64, the AMBA PL011 UART
    driver when enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE.
    arch_initcall(pl011_init) came before subsys_initcall(default_bdi_init),
    devtmpfs' handle_remove() crashes because the reference count is a NULL
    pointer only because wb->bdi hasn't been initialized yet.
    
    Rework so that wb_put have an extra check if wb->bdi before decrement
    wb->refcnt and also add a WARN_ON_ONCE to get a warning if it happens again
    in other drivers.

    e1000e: allow non-monotonic SYSTIM readings
    
    [ Upstream commit e1f65b0d70e9e5c80e15105cd96fa00174d7c436 ]
    
    It seems with some NICs supported by the e1000e driver a SYSTIM reading
    may occasionally be few microseconds before the previous reading and if
    enabled also pass e1000e_sanitize_systim() without reaching the maximum
    number of rereads, even if the function is modified to check three
    consecutive readings (i.e. it doesn't look like a double read error).
    This causes an underflow in the timecounter and the PHC time jumps hours
    ahead.
    
    This was observed on 82574, I217 and I219. The fastest way to reproduce
    it is to run a program that continuously calls the PTP_SYS_OFFSET ioctl
    on the PHC.
    
    Modify e1000e_phc_gettime() to use timecounter_cyc2time() instead of
    timecounter_read() in order to allow non-monotonic SYSTIM readings and
    prevent the PHC from jumping.

    platform/x86: asus-wmi: Tell the EC the OS will handle the display off hotkey
    
    [ Upstream commit 78f3ac76d9e5219589718b9e4733bee21627b3f5 ]
    
    In the past, Asus firmwares would change the panel backlight directly
    through the EC when the display off hotkey (Fn+F7) was pressed, and
    only notify the OS of such change, with 0x33 when the LCD was ON and
    0x34 when the LCD was OFF. These are currently mapped to
    KEY_DISPLAYTOGGLE and KEY_DISPLAY_OFF, respectively.
    
    Most recently the EC on Asus most machines lost ability to toggle the
    LCD backlight directly, but unless the OS informs the firmware it is
    going to handle the display toggle hotkey events, the firmware still
    tries change the brightness through the EC, to no effect. The end result
    is a long list (at Endless we counted 11) of Asus laptop models where
    the display toggle hotkey does not perform any action. Our firmware
    engineers contacts at Asus were surprised that there were still machines
    out there with the old behavior.
    
    Calling WMNB(ASUS_WMI_DEVID_BACKLIGHT==0x00050011, 2) on the _WDG device
    tells the firmware that it should let the OS handle the display toggle
    event, in which case it will simply notify the OS of a key press with
    0x35, as shown by the DSDT excerpts bellow.

    xfs: don't fail when converting shortform attr to long form during ATTR_REPLACE
    
    commit 7b38460dc8e4eafba06c78f8e37099d3b34d473c upstream.
    
    Kanda Motohiro reported that expanding a tiny xattr into a large xattr
    fails on XFS because we remove the tiny xattr from a shortform fork and
    then try to re-add it after converting the fork to extents format having
    not removed the ATTR_REPLACE flag.  This fails because the attr is no
    longer present, causing a fs shutdown.
    
    This is derived from the patch in his bug report, but we really
    shouldn't ignore a nonzero retval from the remove call.

    drm/fb-helper: Ignore the value of fb_var_screeninfo.pixclock
    
    commit 66a8d5bfb518f9f12d47e1d2dce1732279f9451e upstream.
    
    Strict requirement of pixclock to be zero breaks support of SDL 1.2
    which contains hardcoded table of supported video modes with non-zero
    pixclock values[1].
    
    To better understand which pixclock values are considered valid and how
    driver should handle these values, I briefly examined few existing fbdev
    drivers and documentation in Documentation/fb/. And it looks like there
    are no strict rules on that and actual behaviour varies:
    
            * some drivers treat (pixclock == 0) as "use defaults" (uvesafb.c);
            * some treat (pixclock == 0) as invalid value which leads to
              -EINVAL (clps711x-fb.c);
            * some pass converted pixclock value to hardware (uvesafb.c);
            * some are trying to find nearest value from predefined table
              (vga16fb.c, video_gx.c).
    
    Given this, I believe that it should be safe to just ignore this value if
    changing is not supported. It seems that any portable fbdev application
    which was not written only for one specific device working under one
    specific kernel version should not rely on any particular behaviour of
    pixclock anyway.
    
    However, while enabling SDL1 applications to work out of the box when
    there is no /etc/fb.modes with valid settings, this change affects the
    video mode choosing logic in SDL. Depending on current screen
    resolution, contents of /etc/fb.modes and resolution requested by
    application, this may lead to user-visible difference (not always):
    image will be displayed in a right way, but it will be aligned to the
    left instead of center. There is no "right behaviour" here as well, as
    emulated fbdev, opposing to old fbdev drivers, simply ignores any
    requsts of video mode changes with resolutions smaller than current.
    
    The easiest way to reproduce this problem is to install sdl-sopwith[2],
    remove /etc/fb.modes file if it exists, and then try to run sopwith
    from console without X. At least in Fedora 29, sopwith may be simply
    installed from standard repositories.

    block/loop: Use global lock for ioctl() operation.
    
    commit 310ca162d779efee8a2dc3731439680f3e9c1e86 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting NULL pointer dereference [1] which is caused by
    race condition between ioctl(loop_fd, LOOP_CLR_FD, 0) versus
    ioctl(other_loop_fd, LOOP_SET_FD, loop_fd) due to traversing other
    loop devices at loop_validate_file() without holding corresponding
    lo->lo_ctl_mutex locks.
    
    Since ioctl() request on loop devices is not frequent operation, we don't
    need fine grained locking. Let's use global lock in order to allow safe
    traversal at loop_validate_file().
    
    Note that syzbot is also reporting circular locking dependency between
    bdev->bd_mutex and lo->lo_ctl_mutex [2] which is caused by calling
    blkdev_reread_part() with lock held. This patch does not address it.

    In tipc_nl_compat_recv(), when the len variable returned by
    nlmsg_attrlen() is 0, the message is still treated as a valid one,
    which is obviously unresonable. When len is zero, it means the
    message not only doesn't contain any valid TLV payload, but also
    TLV header is not included. Under this stituation, tlv_type field
    in TLV header is still accessed in tipc_nl_compat_dumpit() or
    tipc_nl_compat_doit(), but the field space is obviously illegal.
    Of course, it is not initialized.

    tipc_nl_compat_bearer_disable()
    tipc_nl_compat_link_stat_dump()
    tipc_nl_compat_media_set()
    tipc_nl_compat_bearer_set()

    sctp: allocate sctp_sockaddr_entry with kzalloc
    
    commit 400b8b9a2a17918f8ce00786f596f530e7f30d50 upstream.
    
    The similar issue as fixed in Commit 4a2eb0c37b47 ("sctp: initialize
    sin6_flowinfo for ipv6 addrs in sctp_inet6addr_event") also exists
    in sctp_inetaddr_event, as Alexander noticed.
    
    To fix it, allocate sctp_sockaddr_entry with kzalloc for both sctp
    ipv4 and ipv6 addresses, as does in sctp_v4/6_copy_addrlist().

    levdatum->level can be NULL if we encounter an error while loading
    the policy during sens_read prior to initializing it.  Make sure
    sens_destroy handles that case correctly.

    media: vb2: vb2_mmap: move lock up
    
    commit cd26d1c4d1bc947b56ae404998ae2276df7b39b7 upstream.
    
    If a filehandle is dup()ped, then it is possible to close it from one fd
    and call mmap from the other. This creates a race condition in vb2_mmap
    where it is using queue data that __vb2_queue_free (called from close())
    is in the process of releasing.
    
    By moving up the mutex_lock(mmap_lock) in vb2_mmap this race is avoided
    since __vb2_queue_free is called with the same mutex locked. So vb2_mmap
    now reads consistent buffer data.

    media: vivid: set min width/height to a value > 0
    
    commit 9729d6d282a6d7ce88e64c9119cecdf79edf4e88 upstream.
    
    The capture DV timings capabilities allowed for a minimum width and
    height of 0. So passing a timings struct with 0 values is allowed
    and will later cause a division by zero.
    
    Ensure that the width and height must be >= 16 to avoid this.

    media: vivid: fix error handling of kthread_run
    
    commit 701f49bc028edb19ffccd101997dd84f0d71e279 upstream.
    
    kthread_run returns an error pointer, but elsewhere in the code
    dev->kthread_vid_cap/out is checked against NULL.
    
    If kthread_run returns an error, then set the pointer to NULL.
    
    I chose this method over changing all kthread_vid_cap/out tests
    elsewhere since this is more robust.

    omap2fb: Fix stack memory disclosure
    
    commit a01421e4484327fe44f8e126793ed5a48a221e24 upstream.
    
    Using [1] for static analysis I found that the OMAPFB_QUERY_PLANE,
    OMAPFB_GET_COLOR_KEY, OMAPFB_GET_DISPLAY_INFO, and OMAPFB_GET_VRAM_INFO
    cases could all leak uninitialized stack memory--either due to
    uninitialized padding or 'reserved' fields.
    
    Fix them by clearing the shared union used to store copied out data.

    mfd: tps6586x: Handle interrupts on suspend
    
    commit ac4ca4b9f4623ba5e1ea7a582f286567c611e027 upstream.
    
    The tps6586x driver creates an irqchip that is used by its various child
    devices for managing interrupts. The tps6586x-rtc device is one of its
    children that uses the tps6586x irqchip. When using the tps6586x-rtc as
    a wake-up device from suspend, the following is seen:
    
     PM: Syncing filesystems ... done.
     Freezing user space processes ... (elapsed 0.001 seconds) done.
     OOM killer disabled.
     Freezing remaining freezable tasks ... (elapsed 0.000 seconds) done.
     Disabling non-boot CPUs ...
     Entering suspend state LP1
     Enabling non-boot CPUs ...
     CPU1 is up
     tps6586x 3-0034: failed to read interrupt status
     tps6586x 3-0034: failed to read interrupt status
    
    The reason why the tps6586x interrupt status cannot be read is because
    the tps6586x interrupt is not masked during suspend and when the
    tps6586x-rtc interrupt occurs, to wake-up the device, the interrupt is
    seen before the i2c controller has been resumed in order to read the
    tps6586x interrupt status.
    
    The tps6586x-rtc driver sets it's interrupt as a wake-up source during
    suspend, which gets propagated to the parent tps6586x interrupt.
    However, the tps6586x-rtc driver cannot disable it's interrupt during
    suspend otherwise we would never be woken up and so the tps6586x must
    disable it's interrupt instead.
    
    Prevent the tps6586x interrupt handler from executing on exiting suspend
    before the i2c controller has been resumed by disabling the tps6586x
    interrupt on entering suspend and re-enabling it on resuming from
    suspend.

    mips: fix n32 compat_ipc_parse_version
    
    commit 5a9372f751b5350e0ce3d2ee91832f1feae2c2e5 upstream.
    
    While reading through the sysvipc implementation, I noticed that the n32
    semctl/shmctl/msgctl system calls behave differently based on whether
    o32 support is enabled or not: Without o32, the IPC_64 flag passed by
    user space is rejected but calls without that flag get IPC_64 behavior.
    
    As far as I can tell, this was inadvertently changed by a cleanup patch
    but never noticed by anyone, possibly nobody has tried using sysvipc
    on n32 after linux-3.19.
    
    Change it back to the old behavior now.

    scsi: sd: Fix cache_type_store()
    
    commit 44759979a49bfd2d20d789add7fa81a21eb1a4ab upstream.
    
    Changing of caching mode via /sys/devices/.../scsi_disk/.../cache_type may
    fail if device responds to MODE SENSE command with DPOFUA flag set, and
    then checks this flag to be not set on MODE SELECT command.
    
    In this scenario, when trying to change cache_type, write always fails:
    
            # echo "none" >cache_type
            bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
    
    And following appears in dmesg:
    
            [13007.865745] sd 1:0:1:0: [sda] Sense Key : Illegal Request [current]

    From SBC-4 r15, 6.5.1 "Mode pages overview", description of DEVICE-SPECIFIC
    PARAMETER field in the mode parameter header:
            ...
            The write protect (WP) bit for mode data sent with a MODE SELECT

            ...
            The DPOFUA bit is reserved for mode data sent with a MODE SELECT
            command.

    The remaining bits in the DEVICE-SPECIFIC PARAMETER byte are also reserved

    btrfs: wait on ordered extents on abort cleanup
    
    commit 74d5d229b1bf60f93bff244b2dfc0eb21ec32a07 upstream.
    
    If we flip read-only before we initiate writeback on all dirty pages for
    ordered extents we've created then we'll have ordered extents left over
    on umount, which results in all sorts of bad things happening.  Fix this
    by making sure we wait on ordered extents if we have to do the aborted
    transaction cleanup stuff.

    crypto: authenc - fix parsing key with misaligned rta_len
    
    commit 8f9c469348487844328e162db57112f7d347c49f upstream.
    
    Keys for "authenc" AEADs are formatted as an rtattr containing a 4-byte
    'enckeylen', followed by an authentication key and an encryption key.
    crypto_authenc_extractkeys() parses the key to find the inner keys.
    
    However, it fails to consider the case where the rtattr's payload is
    longer than 4 bytes but not 4-byte aligned, and where the key ends
    before the next 4-byte aligned boundary.  In this case, 'keylen -=
    RTA_ALIGN(rta->rta_len);' underflows to a value near UINT_MAX.  This
    causes a buffer overread and crash during crypto_ahash_setkey().
    
    Fix it by restricting the rtattr payload to the expected size.
    
    Reproducer using AF_ALG:
    
            #include <linux/if_alg.h>
            #include <linux/rtnetlink.h>

    crypto: authencesn - Avoid twice completion call in decrypt path
    
    commit a7773363624b034ab198c738661253d20a8055c2 upstream.
    
    Authencesn template in decrypt path unconditionally calls aead_request_complete
    after ahash_verify which leads to following kernel panic in after decryption.

    ip: on queued skb use skb_header_pointer instead of pskb_may_pull

    Commit 2efd4fca703a ("ip: in cmsg IP(V6)_ORIGDSTADDR call
    pskb_may_pull") avoided a read beyond the end of the skb linear
    segment by calling pskb_may_pull.
    
    That function can trigger a BUG_ON in pskb_expand_head if the skb is
    shared, which it is when when peeking. It can also return ENOMEM.
    
    Avoid both by switching to safer skb_header_pointer.

    net: bridge: fix a bug on using a neighbour cache entry without checking its state
    
    [ Upstream commit 4c84edc11b76590859b1e45dd676074c59602dc4 ]
    
    When handling DNAT'ed packets on a bridge device, the neighbour cache entry
    from lookup was used without checking its state. It means that a cache entry
    in the NUD_STALE state will be used directly instead of entering the NUD_DELAY
    state to confirm the reachability of the neighbor.
    
    This problem becomes worse after commit 2724680bceee ("neigh: Keep neighbour
    cache entries if number of them is small enough."), since all neighbour cache
    entries in the NUD_STALE state will be kept in the neighbour table as long as
    the number of cache entries does not exceed the value specified in gc_thresh1.
    
    This commit validates the state of a neighbour cache entry before using
    the entry.

    arm64: Don't trap host pointer auth use to EL2
    
    [ Backport of upstream commit b3669b1e1c09890d61109a1a8ece2c5b66804714 ]
    
    To allow EL0 (and/or EL1) to use pointer authentication functionality,
    we must ensure that pointer authentication instructions and accesses to
    pointer authentication keys are not trapped to EL2.
    
    This patch ensures that HCR_EL2 is configured appropriately when the
    kernel is booted at EL2. For non-VHE kernels we set HCR_EL2.{API,APK},
    ensuring that EL1 can access keys and permit EL0 use of instructions.
    For VHE kernels host EL0 (TGE && E2H) is unaffected by these settings,
    and it doesn't matter how we configure HCR_EL2.{API,APK}, so we don't
    bother setting them.
    
    This does not enable support for KVM guests, since KVM manages HCR_EL2
    itself when running VMs.

    arm64/kvm: consistently handle host HCR_EL2 flags
    
    [ Backport of upstream commit 4eaed6aa2c628101246bcabc91b203bfac1193f8 ]
    
    In KVM we define the configuration of HCR_EL2 for a VHE HOST in
    HCR_HOST_VHE_FLAGS, but we don't have a similar definition for the
    non-VHE host flags, and open-code HCR_RW. Further, in head.S we
    open-code the flags for VHE and non-VHE configurations.
    
    In future, we're going to want to configure more flags for the host, so
    lets add a HCR_HOST_NVHE_FLAGS defintion, and consistently use both
    HCR_HOST_VHE_FLAGS and HCR_HOST_NVHE_FLAGS in the kvm code and head.S.
    
    We now use mov_q to generate the HCR_EL2 value, as we use when
    configuring other registers in head.S.

    f2fs: fix validation of the block count in sanity_check_raw_super
    
    commit 88960068f25fcc3759455d85460234dcc9d43fef upstream.
    
    Treat "block_count" from struct f2fs_super_block as 64-bit little endian
    value in sanity_check_raw_super() because struct f2fs_super_block
    declares "block_count" as "__le64".
    
    This fixes a bug where the superblock validation fails on big endian
    devices with the following error:
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Wrong segment_count / block_count (61439 > 0)
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Can't find valid F2FS filesystem in 1th superblock
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Wrong segment_count / block_count (61439 > 0)
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Can't find valid F2FS filesystem in 2th superblock
    As result of this the partition cannot be mounted.
    
    With this patch applied the superblock validation works fine and the
    partition can be mounted again:
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Mounted with checkpoint version = 7c84
    
    My little endian x86-64 hardware was able to mount the partition without
    this fix.
    To confirm that mounting f2fs filesystems works on big endian machines
    again I tested this on a 32-bit MIPS big endian (lantiq) device.

    f2fs: fix to do sanity check with cp_pack_start_sum
    
    commit e494c2f995d6181d6e29c4927d68e0f295ecf75b upstream.
    
    After fuzzing, cp_pack_start_sum could be corrupted, so current log's
    summary info should be wrong due to loading incorrect summary block.
    Then, if segment's type in current log is exceeded NR_CURSEG_TYPE, it
    can lead accessing invalid dirty_i->dirty_segmap bitmap finally.
    
    Add sanity check for cp_pack_start_sum to fix this issue.

    f2fs: fix to do sanity check with block address in main area v2
    
    commit 91291e9998d208370eb8156c760691b873bd7522 upstream.
    
    This patch adds f2fs_is_valid_blkaddr() in below functions to do sanity
    check with block address to avoid pentential panic:
    - f2fs_grab_read_bio()
    - __written_first_block()

    f2fs: fix to do sanity check with block address in main area
    
    commit c9b60788fc760d136211853f10ce73dc152d1f4a upstream.
    
    This patch add to do sanity check with below field:
    - cp_pack_total_block_count
    - blkaddr of data/node
    - extent info
    
    - Overview
    BUG() in verify_block_addr() when writing to a corrupted f2fs image
    
    - Reproduce (4.18 upstream kernel)
    
    - POC (poc.c)
    
    static void activity(char *mpoint) {
    
      char *foo_bar_baz;
      int err;
    
      static int buf[8192];
      memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
    
      err = asprintf(&foo_bar_baz, "%s/foo/bar/baz", mpoint);
    
      int fd = open(foo_bar_baz, O_RDWR | O_TRUNC, 0777);
      if (fd >= 0) {
        write(fd, (char *)buf, sizeof(buf));
        fdatasync(fd);
        close(fd);
      }
    }
    
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
      activity(argv[1]);
      return 0;
    }

    f2fs: fix to do sanity check with reserved blkaddr of inline inode
    
    commit 4dbe38dc386910c668c75ae616b99b823b59f3eb upstream.
    
    As Wen Xu reported in bugzilla, after image was injected with random data
    by fuzzing, inline inode would contain invalid reserved blkaddr, then
    during inline conversion, we will encounter illegal memory accessing
    reported by KASAN, the root cause of this is when writing out converted
    inline page, we will use invalid reserved blkaddr to update sit bitmap,
    result in accessing memory beyond sit bitmap boundary.
    
    In order to fix this issue, let's do sanity check with reserved block
    address of inline inode to avoid above condition.

    f2fs: Add sanity_check_inode() function
    
    This was done as part of commits 5d64600d4f33 "f2fs: avoid bug_on on
    corrupted inode" and 76d56d4ab4f2 "f2fs: fix to do sanity check with
    extra_attr feature" upstream, but the specific checks they added are
    not applicable to 4.4.

            curseg->zone = GET_ZONE_FROM_SEG(sbi, curseg->segno);
    
    If secs_per_zone is corrupted due to fuzzing test, it will cause divide
    zero operation when using GET_ZONE_FROM_SEG macro, so we should do more
    sanity check with secs_per_zone during mount to avoid this issue.

    f2fs: introduce and spread verify_blkaddr
    
    commit e1da7872f6eda977bd812346bf588c35e4495a1e upstream.
    
    This patch introduces verify_blkaddr to check meta/data block address
    with valid range to detect bug earlier.
    
    In addition, once we encounter an invalid blkaddr, notice user to run
    fsck to fix, and let the kernel panic.

    f2fs: enhance sanity_check_raw_super() to avoid potential overflow
    
    commit 0cfe75c5b011994651a4ca6d74f20aa997bfc69a upstream.
    
    In order to avoid the below overflow issue, we should have checked the
    boundaries in superblock before reaching out to allocation. As Linus suggested,
    the right place should be sanity_check_raw_super().
    
    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported:
    
    There are integer overflows with using the cp_payload superblock field in the
    f2fs filesystem potentially leading to memory corruption.
    
    include/linux/f2fs_fs.h
    
    struct f2fs_super_block {
    ...
            __le32 cp_payload;

    typedef u32 block_t;    /*
                             * should not change u32, since it is the on-disk block
                             * address format, __le32.
                             */
    ...
    
    static inline block_t __cp_payload(struct f2fs_sb_info *sbi)
    {
            return le32_to_cpu(F2FS_RAW_SUPER(sbi)->cp_payload);
    }
    
    fs/f2fs/checkpoint.c
    
            block_t start_blk, orphan_blocks, i, j;
    ...
            start_blk = __start_cp_addr(sbi) + 1 + __cp_payload(sbi);
            orphan_blocks = __start_sum_addr(sbi) - 1 - __cp_payload(sbi);
    
    +++ integer overflows
    
    ...
            unsigned int cp_blks = 1 + __cp_payload(sbi);
    ...
            sbi->ckpt = kzalloc(cp_blks * blk_size, GFP_KERNEL);
    
    +++ integer overflow leading to incorrect heap allocation.
    
            int cp_payload_blks = __cp_payload(sbi);
    ...
            ckpt->cp_pack_start_sum = cpu_to_le32(1 + cp_payload_blks +
                            orphan_blocks);

                            NR_CURSEG_TYPE - __cp_payload(sbi)) *

    f2fs: use crc and cp version to determine roll-forward recovery
    
    commit a468f0ef516fda9c7d91bb550d458e853d76955e upstream.
    
    Previously, we used cp_version only to detect recoverable dnodes.
    In order to avoid same garbage cp_version, we needed to truncate the next
    dnode during checkpoint, resulting in additional discard or data write.
    If we can distinguish this by using crc in addition to cp_version, we can
    remove this overhead.
    
    There is backward compatibility concern where it changes node_footer layout.
    So, this patch introduces a new checkpoint flag, CP_CRC_RECOVERY_FLAG, to
    detect new layout. New layout will be activated only when this flag is set.

    f2fs: avoid unneeded loop in build_sit_entries
    
    commit d600af236da51d9e3b90d21a23f95b820bd02e2f upstream.
    
    When building each sit entry in cache, firstly, we will load it from
    sit page, and then check all entries in sit journal, if there is one
    updated entry in journal, cover cached entry with the journaled one.
    
    Actually, most of check operation is unneeded since we only need
    to update cached entries with journaled entries in batch, so
    changing the flow as below for more efficient:
    1. load all sit entries into cache from sit pages;
    2. update sit entries with journal.

    f2fs: fix to avoid reading out encrypted data in page cache
    
    commit 78682f79447998369a85f12b6437fa8fdbbdca50 upstream.
    
    For encrypted inode, if user overwrites data of the inode, f2fs will read
    encrypted data into page cache, and then do the decryption.
    
    However reader can race with overwriter, and it will see encrypted data
    which has not been decrypted by overwriter yet. Fix it by moving decrypting
    work to background and keep page non-uptodated until data is decrypted.

    The reason is: in recovery flow, we use delayed iput mechanism for directory
    which has recovered dentry block. It means the reference of inode will be
    held until last dirty dentry page being writebacked.
    
    But when we mount f2fs with inline_dentry option, during recovery, dirent
    may only be recovered into dir inode page rather than dentry page, so there
    are no chance for us to release inode reference in ->writepage when
    writebacking last dentry page.
    
    We can call paired iget/iput explicityly for inline_dentry case, but for
    non-inline_dentry case, iput will call writeback_single_inode to write all
    data pages synchronously, but during recovery, ->writepages of f2fs skips
    writing all pages, result in losing dirent.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by obsoleting old mechanism, and introduce a
    new dir_list to hold all directory inodes which has recovered datas until
    finishing recovery.

    ...
    
    The reason is: when doing the inline dir conversion, we didn't consider
    that directory has hierarchical hash structure which can be configured
    through sysfs interface 'dir_level'.
    
    By default, dir_level of directory inode is 0, it means we have one bucket
    in hash table located in first level, all dirents will be hashed in this
    bucket, so it has no problem for us to do the duplication simply between
    inline dentry page and converted normal dentry page.
    
    However, if we configured dir_level with the value N (greater than 0), it
    will expand the bucket number of first level hash table by 2^N - 1, it
    hashs dirents into different buckets according their hash value, if we
    still move all dirents to first bucket, it makes incorrent locating for
    inline dirents, the result is, although we can iterate all dirents through
    ->readdir, we can't stat some of them in ->lookup which based on hash
    table searching.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by rehashing dirents into correct position
    when converting inline directory.

    f2fs: move sanity checking of cp into get_valid_checkpoint
    
    commit 984ec63c5a82a07ad4490ecc69bebacd23f6fa64 upstream.
    
    >From the function name of get_valid_checkpoint, it seems to return
    the valid cp or NULL for caller to check. If no valid one is found,
    f2fs_fill_super will print the err log. But if get_valid_checkpoint
    get one valid(the return value indicate that it's valid, however actually
    it is invalid after sanity checking), then print another similar err
    log. That seems strange. Let's keep sanity checking inside the procedure
    of geting valid cp. Another improvement we gained from this move is
    that even the large volume is supported, we check the cp in advanced
    to skip the following procedure if failing the sanity checking.

    can: gw: ensure DLC boundaries after CAN frame modification
    
    commit 0aaa81377c5a01f686bcdb8c7a6929a7bf330c68 upstream.
    
    Muyu Yu provided a POC where user root with CAP_NET_ADMIN can create a CAN
    frame modification rule that makes the data length code a higher value than
    the available CAN frame data size. In combination with a configured checksum
    calculation where the result is stored relatively to the end of the data
    (e.g. cgw_csum_xor_rel) the tail of the skb (e.g. frag_list pointer in
    skb_shared_info) can be rewritten which finally can cause a system crash.
    
    Michael Kubecek suggested to drop frames that have a DLC exceeding the
    available space after the modification process and provided a patch that can
    handle CAN FD frames too. Within this patch we also limit the length for the
    checksum calculations to the maximum of Classic CAN data length (8).
    
    CAN frames that are dropped by these additional checks are counted with the
    CGW_DELETED counter which indicates misconfigurations in can-gw rules.
    
    This fixes CVE-2019-3701.

    tty/ldsem: Wake up readers after timed out down_write()
    
    commit 231f8fd0cca078bd4396dd7e380db813ac5736e2 upstream.
    
    ldsem_down_read() will sleep if there is pending writer in the queue.
    If the writer times out, readers in the queue should be woken up,
    otherwise they may miss a chance to acquire the semaphore until the last
    active reader will do ldsem_up_read().
    
    There was a couple of reports where there was one active reader and
    other readers soft locked up:
      Showing all locks held in the system:
      2 locks held by khungtaskd/17:
       #0:  (rcu_read_lock){......}, at: watchdog+0x124/0x6d1
