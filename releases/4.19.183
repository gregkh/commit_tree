    cifs: Fix preauth hash corruption
    
    commit 05946d4b7a7349ae58bfa2d51ae832e64a394c2d upstream.
    
    smb311_update_preauth_hash() uses the shash in server->secmech without
    appropriate locking, and this can lead to sessions corrupting each
    other's preauth hashes.
    
    The following script can easily trigger the problem:
    
            #!/bin/sh -e
    
            NMOUNTS=10
            for i in $(seq $NMOUNTS);
                    mkdir -p /tmp/mnt$i
                    umount /tmp/mnt$i 2>/dev/null || :
            done
            while :; do
                    for i in $(seq $NMOUNTS); do
                            mount -t cifs //192.168.0.1/test /tmp/mnt$i -o ... &
                    done
                    wait
                    for i in $(seq $NMOUNTS); do
                            umount /tmp/mnt$i
                    done
            done
    
    Usually within seconds this leads to one or more of the mounts failing
    with the following errors, and a "Bad SMB2 signature for message" is
    seen in the server logs:
    
     CIFS: VFS: \\192.168.0.1 failed to connect to IPC (rc=-13)
     CIFS: VFS: cifs_mount failed w/return code = -13
    
    Fix it by holding the server mutex just like in the other places where
    the shashes are used.

    x86/apic/of: Fix CPU devicetree-node lookups
    
    commit dd926880da8dbbe409e709c1d3c1620729a94732 upstream.
    
    Architectures that describe the CPU topology in devicetree and do not have
    an identity mapping between physical and logical CPU ids must override the
    default implementation of arch_match_cpu_phys_id().
    
    Failing to do so breaks CPU devicetree-node lookups using of_get_cpu_node()
    and of_cpu_device_node_get() which several drivers rely on. It also causes
    the CPU struct devices exported through sysfs to point to the wrong
    devicetree nodes.
    
    On x86, CPUs are described in devicetree using their APIC ids and those
    do not generally coincide with the logical ids, even if CPU0 typically
    uses APIC id 0.
    
    Add the missing implementation of arch_match_cpu_phys_id() so that CPU-node
    lookups work also with SMP.
    
    Apart from fixing the broken sysfs devicetree-node links this likely does
    not affect current users of mainline kernels on x86.

    genirq: Disable interrupts for force threaded handlers
    
    commit 81e2073c175b887398e5bca6c004efa89983f58d upstream.
    
    With interrupt force threading all device interrupt handlers are invoked
    from kernel threads. Contrary to hard interrupt context the invocation only
    disables bottom halfs, but not interrupts. This was an oversight back then
    because any code like this will have an issue:
    
    thread(irq_A)
      irq_handler(A)
        spin_lock(&foo->lock);
    
    interrupt(irq_B)
      irq_handler(B)
        spin_lock(&foo->lock);
    
    This has been triggered with networking (NAPI vs. hrtimers) and console
    drivers where printk() happens from an interrupt which interrupted the
    force threaded handler.
    
    Now people noticed and started to change the spin_lock() in the handler to
    spin_lock_irqsave() which affects performance or add IRQF_NOTHREAD to the
    interrupt request which in turn breaks RT.
    
    Fix the root cause and not the symptom and disable interrupts before
    invoking the force threaded handler which preserves the regular semantics
    and the usefulness of the interrupt force threading as a general debugging
    tool.
    
    For not RT this is not changing much, except that during the execution of
    the threaded handler interrupts are delayed until the handler
    returns. Vs. scheduling and softirq processing there is no difference.
    
    For RT kernels there is no issue.

    x86: Introduce TS_COMPAT_RESTART to fix get_nr_restart_syscall()
    
    commit 8c150ba2fb5995c84a7a43848250d444a3329a7d upstream.
    
    The comment in get_nr_restart_syscall() says:
    
             * The problem is that we can get here when ptrace pokes
             * syscall-like values into regs even if we're not in a syscall
             * at all.
    
    Yes, but if not in a syscall then the
    
            status & (TS_COMPAT|TS_I386_REGS_POKED)
    
    check below can't really help:
    
            - TS_COMPAT can't be set
    
            - TS_I386_REGS_POKED is only set if regs->orig_ax was changed by
              32bit debugger; and even in this case get_nr_restart_syscall()
              is only correct if the tracee is 32bit too.
    
    Suppose that a 64bit debugger plays with a 32bit tracee and
    
            * Tracee calls sleep(2) // TS_COMPAT is set
            * User interrupts the tracee by CTRL-C after 1 sec and does
              "(gdb) call func()"
            * gdb saves the regs by PTRACE_GETREGS
            * does PTRACE_SETREGS to set %rip='func' and %orig_rax=-1
            * PTRACE_CONT           // TS_COMPAT is cleared
            * func() hits int3.
            * Debugger catches SIGTRAP.
            * Restore original regs by PTRACE_SETREGS.
            * PTRACE_CONT
    
    get_nr_restart_syscall() wrongly returns __NR_restart_syscall==219, the
    tracee calls ia32_sys_call_table[219] == sys_madvise.
    
    Add the sticky TS_COMPAT_RESTART flag which survives after return to user
    mode. It's going to be removed in the next step again by storing the
    information in the restart block. As a further cleanup it might be possible
    to remove also TS_I386_REGS_POKED with that.

    x86/ioapic: Ignore IRQ2 again
    
    commit a501b048a95b79e1e34f03cac3c87ff1e9f229ad upstream.
    
    Vitaly ran into an issue with hotplugging CPU0 on an Amazon instance where
    the matrix allocator claimed to be out of vectors. He analyzed it down to
    the point that IRQ2, the PIC cascade interrupt, which is supposed to be not
    ever routed to the IO/APIC ended up having an interrupt vector assigned
    which got moved during unplug of CPU0.
    
    The underlying issue is that IRQ2 for various reasons (see commit
    af174783b925 ("x86: I/O APIC: Never configure IRQ2" for details) is treated
    as a reserved system vector by the vector core code and is not accounted as
    a regular vector. The Amazon BIOS has an routing entry of pin2 to IRQ2
    which causes the IO/APIC setup to claim that interrupt which is granted by
    the vector domain because there is no sanity check. As a consequence the
    allocation counter of CPU0 underflows which causes a subsequent unplug to
    fail with:
    
      [ ... ] CPU 0 has 4294967295 vectors, 589 available. Cannot disable CPU
    
    There is another sanity check missing in the matrix allocator, but the
    underlying root cause is that the IO/APIC code lost the IRQ2 ignore logic
    during the conversion to irqdomains.
    
    For almost 6 years nobody complained about this wreckage, which might
    indicate that this requirement could be lifted, but for any system which
    actually has a PIC IRQ2 is unusable by design so any routing entry has no
    effect and the interrupt cannot be connected to a device anyway.
    
    Due to that and due to history biased paranoia reasons restore the IRQ2
    ignore logic and treat it as non existent despite a routing entry claiming
    otherwise.

    perf/x86/intel: Fix a crash caused by zero PEBS status
    
    commit d88d05a9e0b6d9356e97129d4ff9942d765f46ea upstream.
    
    A repeatable crash can be triggered by the perf_fuzzer on some Haswell
    system.
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/7170d3b-c17f-1ded-52aa-cc6d9ae999f4@maine.edu/
    
    For some old CPUs (HSW and earlier), the PEBS status in a PEBS record
    may be mistakenly set to 0. To minimize the impact of the defect, the
    commit was introduced to try to avoid dropping the PEBS record for some
    cases. It adds a check in the intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm(), and updates
    the local pebs_status accordingly. However, it doesn't correct the PEBS
    status in the PEBS record, which may trigger the crash, especially for
    the large PEBS.
    
    It's possible that all the PEBS records in a large PEBS have the PEBS
    status 0. If so, the first get_next_pebs_record_by_bit() in the
    __intel_pmu_pebs_event() returns NULL. The at = NULL. Since it's a large
    PEBS, the 'count' parameter must > 1. The second
    get_next_pebs_record_by_bit() will crash.

    PCI: rpadlpar: Fix potential drc_name corruption in store functions
    
    commit cc7a0bb058b85ea03db87169c60c7cfdd5d34678 upstream.
    
    Both add_slot_store() and remove_slot_store() try to fix up the
    drc_name copied from the store buffer by placing a NUL terminator at
    nbyte + 1 or in place of a '\n' if present. However, the static buffer
    that we copy the drc_name data into is not zeroed and can contain
    anything past the n-th byte.
    
    This is problematic if a '\n' byte appears in that buffer after nbytes
    and the string copied into the store buffer was not NUL terminated to
    start with as the strchr() search for a '\n' byte will mark this
    incorrectly as the end of the drc_name string resulting in a drc_name
    string that contains garbage data after the n-th byte.
    
    Additionally it will cause us to overwrite that '\n' byte on the stack
    with NUL, potentially corrupting data on the stack.
    
    The following debugging shows an example of the drmgr utility writing
    "PHB 4543" to the add_slot sysfs attribute, but add_slot_store()
    logging a corrupted string value.
    
      drmgr: drmgr: -c phb -a -s PHB 4543 -d 1
      add_slot_store: drc_name = PHB 4543°|<82>!, rc = -19
    
    Fix this by using strscpy() instead of memcpy() to ensure the string
    is NUL terminated when copied into the static drc_name buffer.
    Further, since the string is now NUL terminated the code only needs to
    change '\n' to '\0' when present.

    usb-storage: Add quirk to defeat Kindle's automatic unload
    
    commit 546aa0e4ea6ed81b6c51baeebc4364542fa3f3a7 upstream.
    
    Matthias reports that the Amazon Kindle automatically removes its
    emulated media if it doesn't receive another SCSI command within about
    one second after a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE.  It does so even when the host
    has sent a PREVENT MEDIUM REMOVAL command.  The reason for this
    behavior isn't clear, although it's not hard to make some guesses.
    
    At any rate, the results can be unexpected for anyone who tries to
    access the Kindle in an unusual fashion, and in theory they can lead
    to data loss (for example, if one file is closed and synchronized
    while other files are still in the middle of being written).
    
    To avoid such problems, this patch creates a new usb-storage quirks
    flag telling the driver always to issue a REQUEST SENSE following a
    SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command, and adds an unusual_devs entry for the
    Kindle with the flag set.  This is sufficient to prevent the Kindle
    from doing its automatic unload, without interfering with proper
    operation.
    
    Another possible way to deal with this would be to increase the
    frequency of TEST UNIT READY polling that the kernel normally carries
    out for removable-media storage devices.  However that would increase
    the overall load on the system and it is not as reliable, because the
    user can override the polling interval.  Changing the driver's
    behavior is safer and has minimal overhead.

    powerpc: Force inlining of cpu_has_feature() to avoid build failure
    
    commit eed5fae00593ab9d261a0c1ffc1bdb786a87a55a upstream.
    
    The code relies on constant folding of cpu_has_feature() based
    on possible and always true values as defined per
    CPU_FTRS_ALWAYS and CPU_FTRS_POSSIBLE.
    
    Build failure is encountered with for instance
    book3e_all_defconfig on kisskb in the AMDGPU driver which uses
    cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTR_VSX_COMP) to decide whether calling
    kernel_enable_vsx() or not.
    
    The failure is due to cpu_has_feature() not being inlined with
    that configuration with gcc 4.9.
    
    In the same way as commit acdad8fb4a15 ("powerpc: Force inlining of
    mmu_has_feature to fix build failure"), for inlining of
    cpu_has_feature().

    We only setup io queues for nvme controllers, and it makes absolutely no
    sense to allow a controller (re)connect without any I/O queues.  If we
    happen to fail setting the queue count for any reason, we should not allow
    this to be a successful reconnect as I/O has no chance in going through.
    Instead just fail and schedule another reconnect.

    sunrpc: fix refcount leak for rpc auth modules
    
    commit f1442d6349a2e7bb7a6134791bdc26cb776c79af upstream.
    
    If an auth module's accept op returns SVC_CLOSE, svc_process_common()
    enters a call path that does not call svc_authorise() before leaving the
    function, and thus leaks a reference on the auth module's refcount. Hence,
    make sure calls to svc_authenticate() and svc_authorise() are paired for
    all call paths, to make sure rpc auth modules can be unloaded.

    svcrdma: disable timeouts on rdma backchannel
    
    commit 6820bf77864d5894ff67b5c00d7dba8f92011e3d upstream.
    
    This brings it in line with the regular tcp backchannel, which also has
    all those timeouts disabled.
    
    Prevents the backchannel from timing out, getting some async operations
    like server side copying getting stuck indefinitely on the client side.

    NFSD: Repair misuse of sv_lock in 5.10.16-rt30.
    
    commit c7de87ff9dac5f396f62d584f3908f80ddc0e07b upstream.
    
    [ This problem is in mainline, but only rt has the chops to be
    able to detect it. ]
    
    Lockdep reports a circular lock dependency between serv->sv_lock and
    softirq_ctl.lock on system shutdown, when using a kernel built with
    CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT=y, and a nfs mount exists.
    
    This is due to the definition of spin_lock_bh on rt:
    
            local_bh_disable();
            rt_spin_lock(lock);
    
    which forces a softirq_ctl.lock -> serv->sv_lock dependency.  This is
    not a problem as long as _every_ lock of serv->sv_lock is a:
    
            spin_lock_bh(&serv->sv_lock);
    
    but there is one of the form:
    
            spin_lock(&serv->sv_lock);
    
    This is what is causing the circular dependency splat.  The spin_lock()
    grabs the lock without first grabbing softirq_ctl.lock via local_bh_disable.
    If later on in the critical region,  someone does a local_bh_disable, we
    get a serv->sv_lock -> softirq_ctrl.lock dependency established.  Deadlock.
    
    Fix is to make serv->sv_lock be locked with spin_lock_bh everywhere, no
    exceptions.

    When using the driver in I2S TDM mode, the _fsl_ssi_set_dai_fmt()
    function rewrites the number of slots previously set by the
    fsl_ssi_set_dai_tdm_slot() function to 2 by default.
    To fix this, let's use the saved slot count value or, if TDM
    is not used and the slot count is not set, proceed as before.

      1208                    switch (tm->op) {
      1209                    case MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING:
      1210                            BUG_ON(tm->slot < n);
      1211                            fallthrough;
      1212                    case MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_MOVING:
      1213                    case MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE:
      1214                            btrfs_set_node_key(eb, &tm->key, tm->slot);
    
    Here's what happens to hit that BUG_ON():
    
    1) We have one tree mod log user (through fiemap or the logical ino ioctl),
       with a sequence number of 1, so we have fs_info->tree_mod_seq == 1;
    
    2) Another task is at ctree.c:balance_level() and we have eb X currently as
       the root of the tree, and we promote its single child, eb Y, as the new
       root.
    
       Then, at ctree.c:balance_level(), we call:
    
          tree_mod_log_insert_root(eb X, eb Y, 1);
    
    3) At tree_mod_log_insert_root() we create tree mod log elements for each
       slot of eb X, of operation type MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING each
       with a ->logical pointing to ebX->start. These are placed in an array
       named tm_list.
       Lets assume there are N elements (N pointers in eb X);
    
    4) Then, still at tree_mod_log_insert_root(), we create a tree mod log
       element of operation type MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE, ->logical set to
       ebY->start, ->old_root.logical set to ebX->start, ->old_root.level set
       to the level of eb X and ->generation set to the generation of eb X;
    
    5) Then tree_mod_log_insert_root() calls tree_mod_log_free_eb() with
       tm_list as argument. After that, tree_mod_log_free_eb() calls
       __tree_mod_log_insert() for each member of tm_list in reverse order,
       from highest slot in eb X, slot N - 1, to slot 0 of eb X;
    
    6) __tree_mod_log_insert() sets the sequence number of each given tree mod
       log operation - it increments fs_info->tree_mod_seq and sets
       fs_info->tree_mod_seq as the sequence number of the given tree mod log
       operation.
    
       This means that for the tm_list created at tree_mod_log_insert_root(),
       the element corresponding to slot 0 of eb X has the highest sequence
       number (1 + N), and the element corresponding to the last slot has the
       lowest sequence number (2);
    
    7) Then, after inserting tm_list's elements into the tree mod log rbtree,
       the MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE element is inserted, which gets the highest
       sequence number, which is N + 2;
    
    8) Back to ctree.c:balance_level(), we free eb X by calling
       btrfs_free_tree_block() on it. Because eb X was created in the current
       transaction, has no other references and writeback did not happen for
       it, we add it back to the free space cache/tree;
    
    9) Later some other task T allocates the metadata extent from eb X, since
       it is marked as free space in the space cache/tree, and uses it as a
       node for some other btree;
    
    10) The tree mod log user task calls btrfs_search_old_slot(), which calls
        get_old_root(), and finally that calls __tree_mod_log_oldest_root()
        with time_seq == 1 and eb_root == eb Y;
    
    11) First iteration of the while loop finds the tree mod log element with
        sequence number N + 2, for the logical address of eb Y and of type
        MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE;
    
    12) Because the operation type is MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE, we don't break out
        of the loop, and set root_logical to point to tm->old_root.logical
        which corresponds to the logical address of eb X;
    
    13) On the next iteration of the while loop, the call to
        tree_mod_log_search_oldest() returns the smallest tree mod log element
        for the logical address of eb X, which has a sequence number of 2, an
        operation type of MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING and corresponds to
        the old slot N - 1 of eb X (eb X had N items in it before being freed);
    
    14) We then break out of the while loop and return the tree mod log operation
        of type MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE (eb Y), and not the one for slot N - 1 of
        eb X, to get_old_root();
    
    15) At get_old_root(), we process the MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE operation
        and set "logical" to the logical address of eb X, which was the old
        root. We then call tree_mod_log_search() passing it the logical
        address of eb X and time_seq == 1;
    
    16) Then before calling tree_mod_log_search(), task T adds a key to eb X,
        which results in adding a tree mod log operation of type
        MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD to the tree mod log - this is done at
        ctree.c:insert_ptr() - but after adding the tree mod log operation
        and before updating the number of items in eb X from 0 to 1...
    
    17) The task at get_old_root() calls tree_mod_log_search() and gets the
        tree mod log operation of type MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD just added by task T.
        Then it enters the following if branch:
    
        if (old_root && tm && tm->op != MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING) {
           (...)
        } (...)
    
        Calls read_tree_block() for eb X, which gets a reference on eb X but
        does not lock it - task T has it locked.
        Then it clones eb X while it has nritems set to 0 in its header, before
        task T sets nritems to 1 in eb X's header. From hereupon we use the
        clone of eb X which no other task has access to;
    
    18) Then we call __tree_mod_log_rewind(), passing it the MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD
        mod log operation we just got from tree_mod_log_search() in the
        previous step and the cloned version of eb X;
    
    19) At __tree_mod_log_rewind(), we set the local variable "n" to the number
        of items set in eb X's clone, which is 0. Then we enter the while loop,
        and in its first iteration we process the MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD operation,
        which just decrements "n" from 0 to (u32)-1, since "n" is declared with
        a type of u32. At the end of this iteration we call rb_next() to find the
        next tree mod log operation for eb X, that gives us the mod log operation
        of type MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING, for slot 0, with a sequence
        number of N + 1 (steps 3 to 6);
    
    20) Then we go back to the top of the while loop and trigger the following
        BUG_ON():
    
            (...)
            switch (tm->op) {
            case MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING:
                     BUG_ON(tm->slot < n);
                     fallthrough;
            (...)
    
        Because "n" has a value of (u32)-1 (4294967295) and tm->slot is 0.
    
    Fix this by taking a read lock on the extent buffer before cloning it at
    ctree.c:get_old_root(). This should be done regardless of the extent
    buffer having been freed and reused, as a concurrent task might be
    modifying it (while holding a write lock on it).

    tools build: Check if gettid() is available before providing helper
    
    commit 4541a8bb13a86e504416a13360c8dc64d2fd612a upstream.
    
    Laura reported that the perf build failed in fedora when we got a glibc
    that provides gettid(), which I reproduced using fedora rawhide with the
    glibc-devel-2.29.9000-26.fc31.x86_64 package.
    
    Add a feature check to avoid providing a gettid() helper in such
    systems.
    
    On a fedora rawhide system with this patch applied we now get:
    
      [root@7a5f55352234 perf]# grep gettid /tmp/build/perf/FEATURE-DUMP

    tools build feature: Check if eventfd() is available
    
    commit 11c6cbe706f218a8dc7e1f962f12b3a52ddd33a9 upstream.
    
    A new 'perf bench epoll' will use this, and to disable it for older
    systems, add a feature test for this API.
    
    This is just a simple program that if successfully compiled, means that
    the feature is present, at least at the library level, in a build that
    sets the output directory to /tmp/build/perf (using O=/tmp/build/perf),
    we end up with:
    
      $ ls -la /tmp/build/perf/feature/test-eventfd*
      -rwxrwxr-x. 1 acme acme 8176 Nov 21 15:58 /tmp/build/perf/feature/test-eventfd.bin
      -rw-rw-r--. 1 acme acme  588 Nov 21 15:58 /tmp/build/perf/feature/test-eventfd.d
      -rw-rw-r--. 1 acme acme    0 Nov 21 15:58 /tmp/build/perf/feature/test-eventfd.make.output
      $ ldd /tmp/build/perf/feature/test-eventfd.bin
              linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff3bf3f000)
              libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fa984061000)
              /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fa984417000)
      $ grep eventfd -A 2 -B 2 /tmp/build/perf/FEATURE-DUMP
      feature-dwarf=1
      feature-dwarf_getlocations=1
      feature-eventfd=1
      feature-fortify-source=1
      feature-sync-compare-and-swap=1
      $
    
    The main thing here is that in the end we'll have -DHAVE_EVENTFD in
    CFLAGS, and then the 'perf bench' entry needing that API can be
    selectively pruned.

    perf tools: Use %define api.pure full instead of %pure-parser
    
    commit fc8c0a99223367b071c83711259d754b6bb7a379 upstream.
    
    bison deprecated the "%pure-parser" directive in favor of "%define
    api.pure full".
    
    The api.pure got introduced in bison 2.3 (Oct 2007), so it seems safe to
    use it without any version check.

    lkdtm: don't move ctors to .rodata
    
    From: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>
    
    commit 3f618ab3323407ee4c6a6734a37eb6e9663ebfb9 upstream.
    
    When building with KASAN and LKDTM, clang may implictly generate an
    asan.module_ctor function in the LKDTM rodata object. The Makefile moves
    the lkdtm_rodata_do_nothing() function into .rodata by renaming the
    file's .text section to .rodata, and consequently also moves the ctor
    function into .rodata, leading to a boot time crash (splat below) when
    the ctor is invoked by do_ctors().
    
    Let's prevent this by marking the function as noinstr rather than
    notrace, and renaming the file's .noinstr.text to .rodata. Marking the
    function as noinstr will prevent tracing and kprobes, and will inhibit
    any undesireable compiler instrumentation.
    
    The ctor function (if any) will be placed in .text and will work
    correctly.

    vmlinux.lds.h: Create section for protection against instrumentation
    
    From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>
    
    commit 6553896666433e7efec589838b400a2a652b3ffa upstream.
    
    Some code pathes, especially the low level entry code, must be protected
    against instrumentation for various reasons:
    
     - Low level entry code can be a fragile beast, especially on x86.
    
     - With NO_HZ_FULL RCU state needs to be established before using it.
    
    Having a dedicated section for such code allows to validate with tooling
    that no unsafe functions are invoked.
    
    Add the .noinstr.text section and the noinstr attribute to mark
    functions. noinstr implies notrace. Kprobes will gain a section check
    later.
    
    Provide also a set of markers: instrumentation_begin()/end()
    
    These are used to mark code inside a noinstr function which calls
    into regular instrumentable text section as safe.
    
    The instrumentation markers are only active when CONFIG_DEBUG_ENTRY is
    enabled as the end marker emits a NOP to prevent the compiler from merging
    the annotation points. This means the objtool verification requires a
    kernel compiled with this option.

    ALSA: hda: generic: Fix the micmute led init state
    
    commit 2bf44e0ee95f39cc54ea1b942f0a027e0181ca4e upstream.
    
    Recently we found the micmute led init state is not correct after
    freshly installing the ubuntu linux on a Lenovo AIO machine. The
    internal mic is not muted, but the micmute led is on and led mode is
    'follow mute'. If we mute internal mic, the led is keeping on, then
    unmute the internal mic, the led is off. And from then on, the
    micmute led will work correctly.
    
    So the micmute led init state is not correct. The led is controlled
    by codec gpio (ALC233_FIXUP_LENOVO_LINE2_MIC_HOTKEY), in the
    patch_realtek, the gpio data is set to 0x4 initially and the led is
    on with this data. In the hda_generic, the led_value is set to
    0 initially, suppose users set the 'capture switch' to on from
    user space and the micmute led should change to be off with this
    operation, but the check "if (val == spec->micmute_led.led_value)" in
    the call_micmute_led_update() will skip the led setting.
    
    To guarantee the led state will be set by the 1st time of changing
    "Capture Switch", set -1 to the init led_value.
