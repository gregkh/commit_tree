    scsi: mpt3sas: Unblock device after controller reset
    
    commit 7ff723ad0f87feba43dda45fdae71206063dd7d4 upstream.
    
    While issuing any ATA passthrough command to firmware the driver will
    block the device. But it will unblock the device only if the I/O
    completes through the ISR path. If a controller reset occurs before
    command completion the device will remain in blocked state.
    
    Make sure we unblock the device following a controller reset if an ATA
    passthrough command was queued.

    flow_dissect: call init_default_flow_dissectors() earlier
    
    commit c9b8af1330198ae241cd545e1f040019010d44d9 upstream.
    
    Andre Noll reported panics after my recent fix (commit 34fad54c2537
    "net: __skb_flow_dissect() must cap its return value")
    
    After some more headaches, Alexander root caused the problem to
    init_default_flow_dissectors() being called too late, in case
    a network driver like IGB is not a module and receives DHCP message
    very early.
    
    Fix is to call init_default_flow_dissectors() much earlier,
    as it is a core infrastructure and does not depend on another
    kernel service.

    drm/radeon: Ensure vblank interrupt is enabled on DPMS transition to on
    
    NOTE: This patch only applies to 4.5.y or older kernels. With newer
    kernels, this problem cannot happen because the driver now uses
    drm_crtc_vblank_on/off instead of drm_vblank_pre/post_modeset[0]. I
    consider this patch safer for older kernels than backporting the API
    change, because drm_crtc_vblank_on/off had various issues in older
    kernels, and I'm not sure all fixes for those have been backported to
    all stable branches where this patch could be applied.
    
        ---------------------
    
    Fixes the vblank interrupt being disabled when it should be on, which
    can cause at least the following symptoms:
    
    * Hangs when running 'xset dpms force off' in a GNOME session with
      gnome-shell using DRI2.
    * RandR 1.4 slave outputs freezing with garbage displayed using
      xf86-video-ati 7.8.0 or newer.

    mpi: Fix NULL ptr dereference in mpi_powm() [ver #3]
    
    commit f5527fffff3f002b0a6b376163613b82f69de073 upstream.
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-8650.
    
    If mpi_powm() is given a zero exponent, it wants to immediately return
    either 1 or 0, depending on the modulus.  However, if the result was
    initalised with zero limb space, no limbs space is allocated and a
    NULL-pointer exception ensues.
    
    Fix this by allocating a minimal amount of limb space for the result when
    the 0-exponent case when the result is 1 and not touching the limb space
    when the result is 0.
    
    This affects the use of RSA keys and X.509 certificates that carry them.

    parisc: Also flush data TLB in flush_icache_page_asm
    
    commit 5035b230e7b67ac12691ed3b5495bbb617027b68 upstream.
    
    This is the second issue I noticed in reviewing the parisc TLB code.
    
    The fic instruction may use either the instruction or data TLB in
    flushing the instruction cache.  Thus, on machines with a split TLB, we
    should also flush the data TLB after setting up the temporary alias
    registers.
    
    Although this has no functional impact, I changed the pdtlb and pitlb
    instructions to consistently use the index register %r0.  These
    instructions do not support integer displacements.
    
    Tested on rp3440 and c8000.

    parisc: Fix race in pci-dma.c
    
    commit c0452fb9fb8f49c7d68ab9fa0ad092016be7b45f upstream.
    
    We are still troubled by occasional random segmentation faults and
    memory memory corruption on SMP machines.  The causes quite a few
    package builds to fail on the Debian buildd machines for parisc.  When
    gcc-6 failed to build three times in a row, I looked again at the TLB
    related code.  I found a couple of issues.  This is the first.
    
    In general, we need to ensure page table updates and corresponding TLB
    purges are atomic.  The attached patch fixes an instance in pci-dma.c
    where the page table update was not guarded by the TLB lock.
    
    Tested on rp3440 and c8000.  So far, no further random segmentation
    faults have been observed.

    From the backtrace, cpu1 is in smp_callin:

    So, it has just flushed its caches and the TLB. It would seem either the
    flushes in parisc_setup_cache_timing or smp_callin have corrupted kernel
    memory.
    
    The attached patch reworks parisc_setup_cache_timing to remove the races
    in setting the cache and TLB flush thresholds. It also corrects the
    number of bytes flushed in the TLB calculation.
    
    The patch flushes the cache and TLB on cpu0 before starting the
    secondary processors so that they are started from a known state.
    
    Tested with a few reboots on c8000.

    NFSv4.x: hide array-bounds warning
    
    commit d55b352b01bc78fbc3d1bb650140668b87e58bf9 upstream.
    
    A correct bugfix introduced a harmless warning that shows up with gcc-7:
    
    fs/nfs/callback.c: In function 'nfs_callback_up':
    fs/nfs/callback.c:214:14: error: array subscript is outside array bounds [-Werror=array-bounds]
    
    What happens here is that the 'minorversion == 0' check tells the
    compiler that we assume minorversion can be something other than 0,
    but when CONFIG_NFS_V4_1 is disabled that would be invalid and
    result in an out-of-bounds access.
    
    The added check for IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_NFS_V4_1) tells gcc that this
    really can't happen, which makes the code slightly smaller and also
    avoids the warning.
    
    The bugfix that introduced the warning is marked for stable backports,
    we want this one backported to the same releases.

    apparmor: fix change_hat not finding hat after policy replacement
    
    commit 3d40658c977769ce2138f286cf131537bf68bdfe upstream.
    
    After a policy replacement, the task cred may be out of date and need
    to be updated. However change_hat is using the stale profiles from
    the out of date cred resulting in either: a stale profile being applied
    or, incorrect failure when searching for a hat profile as it has been
    migrated to the new parent profile.

    cfg80211: limit scan results cache size
    
    commit 9853a55ef1bb66d7411136046060bbfb69c714fa upstream.
    
    It's possible to make scanning consume almost arbitrary amounts
    of memory, e.g. by sending beacon frames with random BSSIDs at
    high rates while somebody is scanning.
    
    Limit the number of BSS table entries we're willing to cache to
    1000, limiting maximum memory usage to maybe 4-5MB, but lower
    in practice - that would be the case for having both full-sized
    beacon and probe response frames for each entry; this seems not
    possible in practice, so a limit of 1000 entries will likely be
    closer to 0.5 MB.

    tile: avoid using clocksource_cyc2ns with absolute cycle count
    
    commit e658a6f14d7c0243205f035979d0ecf6c12a036f upstream.
    
    For large values of "mult" and long uptimes, the intermediate
    result of "cycles * mult" can overflow 64 bits.  For example,
    the tile platform calls clocksource_cyc2ns with a 1.2 GHz clock;
    we have mult = 853, and after 208.5 days, we overflow 64 bits.
    
    Since clocksource_cyc2ns() is intended to be used for relative
    cycle counts, not absolute cycle counts, performance is more
    importance than accepting a wider range of cycle values.  So,
    just use mult_frac() directly in tile's sched_clock().
    
    Commit 4cecf6d401a0 ("sched, x86: Avoid unnecessary overflow
    in sched_clock") by Salman Qazi results in essentially the same
    generated code for x86 as this change does for tile.  In fact,
    a follow-on change by Salman introduced mult_frac() and switched
    to using it, so the C code was largely identical at that point too.
    
    Peter Zijlstra then added mul_u64_u32_shr() and switched x86
    to use it.  This is, in principle, better; by optimizing the
    64x64->64 multiplies to be 32x32->64 multiplies we can potentially
    save some time.  However, the compiler piplines the 64x64->64
    multiplies pretty well, and the conditional branch in the generic
    mul_u64_u32_shr() causes some bubbles in execution, with the
    result that it's pretty much a wash.  If tilegx provided its own
    implementation of mul_u64_u32_shr() without the conditional branch,
    we could potentially save 3 cycles, but that seems like small gain
    for a fair amount of additional build scaffolding; no other platform
    currently provides a mul_u64_u32_shr() override, and tile doesn't
    currently have an <asm/div64.h> header to put the override in.
    
    Additionally, gcc currently has an optimization bug that prevents
    it from recognizing the opportunity to use a 32x32->64 multiply,
    and so the result would be no better than the existing mult_frac()
    until such time as the compiler is fixed.
    
    For now, just using mult_frac() seems like the right answer.

    scsi: mpt3sas: Fix secure erase premature termination
    
    commit 18f6084a989ba1b38702f9af37a2e4049a924be6 upstream.
    
    This is a work around for a bug with LSI Fusion MPT SAS2 when perfoming
    secure erase. Due to the very long time the operation takes, commands
    issued during the erase will time out and will trigger execution of the
    abort hook. Even though the abort hook is called for the specific
    command which timed out, this leads to entire device halt
    (scsi_state terminated) and premature termination of the secure erase.
    
    Set device state to busy while ATA passthrough commands are in progress.

    KVM: x86: check for pic and ioapic presence before use
    
    commit df492896e6dfb44fd1154f5402428d8e52705081 upstream.
    
    Split irqchip allows pic and ioapic routes to be used without them being
    created, which results in NULL access.  Check for NULL and avoid it.
    (The setup is too racy for a nicer solutions.)

    KVM: x86: drop error recovery in em_jmp_far and em_ret_far
    
    commit 2117d5398c81554fbf803f5fd1dc55eb78216c0c upstream.
    
    em_jmp_far and em_ret_far assumed that setting IP can only fail in 64
    bit mode, but syzkaller proved otherwise (and SDM agrees).
    Code segment was restored upon failure, but it was left uninitialized
    outside of long mode, which could lead to a leak of host kernel stack.
    We could have fixed that by always saving and restoring the CS, but we
    take a simpler approach and just break any guest that manages to fail
    as the error recovery is error-prone and modern CPUs don't need emulator
    for this.

    iommu/vt-d: Fix IOMMU lookup for SR-IOV Virtual Functions
    
    commit 1c387188c60f53b338c20eee32db055dfe022a9b upstream.
    
    The VT-d specification (§8.3.3) says:
        ‘Virtual Functions’ of a ‘Physical Function’ are under the scope
        of the same remapping unit as the ‘Physical Function’.
    
    The BIOS is not required to list all the possible VFs in the scope
    tables, and arguably *shouldn't* make any attempt to do so, since there
    could be a huge number of them.
    
    This has been broken basically for ever — the VF is never going to match
    against a specific unit's scope, so it ends up being assigned to the
    INCLUDE_ALL IOMMU. Which was always actually correct by coincidence, but
    now we're looking at Root-Complex integrated devices with SR-IOV support
    it's going to start being wrong.
    
    Fix it to simply use pci_physfn() before doing the lookup for PCI devices.

    iommu/vt-d: Fix PASID table allocation
    
    commit 910170442944e1f8674fd5ddbeeb8ccd1877ea98 upstream.
    
    Somehow I ended up with an off-by-three error in calculating the size of
    the PASID and PASID State tables, which triggers allocations failures as
    those tables unfortunately have to be physically contiguous.
    
    In fact, even the *correct* maximum size of 8MiB is problematic and is
    wont to lead to allocation failures. Since I have extracted a promise
    that this *will* be fixed in hardware, I'm happy to limit it on the
    current hardware to a maximum of 0x20000 PASIDs, which gives us 1MiB
    tables — still not ideal, but better than before.
    
    Reported by Mika Kuoppala <mika.kuoppala@linux.intel.com> and also by
    Xunlei Pang <xlpang@redhat.com> who submitted a simpler patch to fix
    only the allocation (and not the free) to the "correct" limit... which
    was still problematic.
