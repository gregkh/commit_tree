    power/supply: ingenic-battery: Don't change scale if there's only one
    
    commit 86b9182df8bb12610d4d6feac45a69f3ed57bfd2 upstream.
    
    The ADC in the JZ4740 can work either in high-precision mode with a 2.5V
    range, or in low-precision mode with a 7.5V range. The code in place in
    this driver will select the proper scale according to the maximum
    voltage of the battery.
    
    The JZ4770 however only has one mode, with a 6.6V range. If only one
    scale is available, there's no need to change it (and nothing to change
    it to), and trying to do so will fail with -EINVAL.

    Revert "um: Enable CONFIG_CONSTRUCTORS"
    
    commit 87c9366e17259040a9118e06b6dc8de986e5d3d1 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 786b2384bf1c ("um: Enable CONFIG_CONSTRUCTORS").
    
    There are two issues with this commit, uncovered by Anton in tests
    on some (Debian) systems:
    
    1) I completely forgot to call any constructors if CONFIG_CONSTRUCTORS
       isn't set. Don't recall now if it just wasn't needed on my system, or
       if I never tested this case.
    
    2) With that fixed, it works - with CONFIG_CONSTRUCTORS *unset*. If I
       set CONFIG_CONSTRUCTORS, it fails again, which isn't totally
       unexpected since whatever wanted to run is likely to have to run
       before the kernel init etc. that calls the constructors in this case.
    
    Basically, some constructors that gcc emits (libc has?) need to run
    very early during init; the failure mode otherwise was that the ptrace
    fork test already failed:
    
    ----------------------
    $ ./linux mem=512M
    Core dump limits :
            soft - 0
            hard - NONE
    Checking that ptrace can change system call numbers...check_ptrace : child exited with exitcode 6, while expecting 0; status 0x67f
    Aborted
    ----------------------
    
    Thinking more about this, it's clear that we simply cannot support
    CONFIG_CONSTRUCTORS in UML. All the cases we need now (gcov, kasan)
    involve not use of the __attribute__((constructor)), but instead
    some constructor code/entry generated by gcc. Therefore, we cannot
    distinguish between kernel constructors and system constructors.
    
    Thus, revert this commit.

    KVM: arm64: Write arch.mdcr_el2 changes since last vcpu_load on VHE
    
    commit 4942dc6638b07b5326b6d2faa142635c559e7cd5 upstream.
    
    On VHE systems arch.mdcr_el2 is written to mdcr_el2 at vcpu_load time to
    set options for self-hosted debug and the performance monitors
    extension.
    
    Unfortunately the value of arch.mdcr_el2 is not calculated until
    kvm_arm_setup_debug() in the run loop after the vcpu has been loaded.
    This means that the initial brief iterations of the run loop use a zero
    value of mdcr_el2 - until the vcpu is preempted. This also results in a
    delay between changes to vcpu->guest_debug taking effect.
    
    Fix this by writing to mdcr_el2 in kvm_arm_setup_debug() on VHE systems
    when a change to arch.mdcr_el2 has been detected.

    commit 07bfd9bdf568a38d9440c607b72342036011f727 upstream.
    
    On module unload of pcrypt we must unregister the crypto algorithms
    first and then tear down the padata structure.  As otherwise the
    crypto algorithms are still alive and can be used while the padata

    crypto: vmx - reject xts inputs that are too short
    
    commit 1372a51b88fa0d5a8ed2803e4975c98da3f08463 upstream.
    
    When the kernel XTS implementation was extended to deal with ciphertext
    stealing in commit 8083b1bf8163 ("crypto: xts - add support for ciphertext
    stealing"), a check was added to reject inputs that were too short.
    
    However, in the vmx enablement - commit 239668419349 ("crypto: vmx/xts -
    use fallback for ciphertext stealing"), that check wasn't added to the
    vmx implementation. This disparity leads to errors like the following:
    
    alg: skcipher: p8_aes_xts encryption unexpectedly succeeded on test vector "random: len=0 klen=64"; expected_error=-22, cfg="random: inplace may_sleep use_finup src_divs=[<flush>66.99%@+10, 33.1%@alignmask+1155]"
    
    Return -EINVAL if asked to operate with a cryptlen smaller than the AES
    block size. This brings vmx in line with the generic implementation.

    iommu/amd: Support multiple PCI DMA aliases in IRQ Remapping
    
    [ Upstream commit 3c124435e8dd516df4b2fc983f4415386fd6edae ]
    
    Non-Transparent Bridge (NTB) devices (among others) may have many DMA
    aliases seeing the hardware will send requests with different device ids
    depending on their origin across the bridged hardware.
    
    See commit ad281ecf1c7d ("PCI: Add DMA alias quirk for Microsemi Switchtec
    NTB") for more information on this.
    
    The AMD IOMMU IRQ remapping functionality ignores all PCI aliases for
    IRQs so if devices send an interrupt from one of their aliases they
    will be blocked on AMD hardware with the IOMMU enabled.
    
    To fix this, ensure IRQ remapping is enabled for all aliases with
    MSI interrupts.
    
    This is analogous to the functionality added to the Intel IRQ remapping
    code in commit 3f0c625c6ae7 ("iommu/vt-d: Allow interrupts from the entire
    bus for aliased devices")

    [ Upstream commit 3332364e4ebc0581d133a334645a20fd13b580f1 ]
    
    Non-Transparent Bridge (NTB) devices (among others) may have many DMA
    aliases seeing the hardware will send requests with different device ids

    The AMD IOMMU ignores all the PCI aliases except the last one so DMA
    transfers from these aliases will be blocked on AMD hardware with the
    IOMMU enabled.
    
    To fix this, ensure the DTEs are cloned for every PCI alias. This is
    done by copying the DTE data for each alias as well as the IVRS alias
    every time it is changed.

    PCI: Add DMA alias quirk for Intel VCA NTB
    
    [ Upstream commit 56b4cd4b7da9ee95778eb5c8abea49f641ebfd91 ]
    
    Intel Visual Compute Accelerator (VCA) is a family of PCIe add-in devices
    exposing computational units via Non Transparent Bridges (NTB, PEX 87xx).
    
    Similarly to MIC x200, we need to add DMA aliases to allow buffer access
    when IOMMU is enabled.
    
    Add aliases to allow computational unit access to host memory.  These
    aliases mark the whole VCA device as one IOMMU group.
    
    All possible slot numbers (0x20) are used, since we are unable to tell what
    slot is used on other side.  This quirk is intended for both host and
    computational unit sides.  The VCA devices have up to five functions: four
    for DMA channels and one additional.

    This patch adds a quirk disabling keyboard backlight support for the

    Those models wrongly report supporting keyboard backlight control
    features (through SMBIOS tokens) even though they're not equipped with
    a backlit keyboard. This led to broken controls being exposed
    through sysfs by this driver which froze the system when used.

    [ Upstream commit a53ba15d81995868651dd28a85d8045aef3d4e20 ]
    
    Due to a quirky C syntax of declaring pointers to array or function
    prototype, existing __type() macro doesn't work with map key/value types
    that are array or function prototype. One has to create a typedef first
    and use it to specify key/value type for a BPF map.  By using typeof(),
    pointer to type is now handled uniformly for all kinds of types. Convert
    one of self-tests as a demonstration.

    [ Upstream commit adebb11139029ddf1fba6f796c4a476f17eacddc ]
    
    As of commit 648e921888ad ("clk: x86: Stop marking clocks as
    CLK_IS_CRITICAL"), the cht_bsw_rt5645 driver needs to enable the clock
    it's using for the codec's mclk. It does this from commit 7735bce05a9c
    ("ASoC: Intel: boards: use devm_clk_get() unconditionally"), enabling
    pmc_plt_clk_3. However, Strago family Chromebooks use pmc_plt_clk_0 for
    the codec mclk, resulting in white noise with some digital microphones.
    Add a DMI-based quirk for Strago family Chromebooks to use pmc_plt_clk_0
    instead - mirroring the changes made to cht_bsw_max98090_ti in
    commit a182ecd3809c ("ASoC: intel: cht_bsw_max98090_ti: Add quirk for
    boards using pmc_plt_clk_0") and making use of the existing

    For high-res (8K) or HFR (4K120) displays, using uncompressed pixel
    formats like YCbCr444 would exceed the bandwidth of HDMI 2.0, so the

    drivers/net/b44: Change to non-atomic bit operations on pwol_mask
    
    [ Upstream commit f11421ba4af706cb4f5703de34fa77fba8472776 ]
    
    Atomic operations that span cache lines are super-expensive on x86
    (not just to the current processor, but also to other processes as all
    memory operations are blocked until the operation completes). Upcoming
    x86 processors have a switch to cause such operations to generate a #AC
    trap. It is expected that some real time systems will enable this mode
    in BIOS.
    
    In preparation for this, it is necessary to fix code that may execute
    atomic instructions with operands that cross cachelines because the #AC
    trap will crash the kernel.
    
    Since "pwol_mask" is local and never exposed to concurrency, there is
    no need to set bits in pwol_mask using atomic operations.
    
    Directly operate on the byte which contains the bit instead of using
    __set_bit() to avoid any big endian concern due to type cast to
    unsigned long in __set_bit().

    net: Google gve: Remove dma_wmb() before ringing doorbell
    
    [ Upstream commit b54ef37b1ce892fdf6b632d566246d2f2f539910 ]
    
    Current code use dma_wmb() to ensure Rx/Tx descriptors are visible
    to device before writing to doorbell.
    
    However, these dma_wmb() are wrong and unnecessary. Therefore,
    they should be removed.
    
    iowrite32be() called from gve_rx_write_doorbell()/gve_tx_put_doorbell()
    should guaratee that all previous writes to WB/UC memory is visible to
    device before the write done by iowrite32be().
    
    E.g. On ARM64, iowrite32be() calls __iowmb() which expands to dma_wmb()
    and only then calls __raw_writel().

    spi: spi-dw: Add lock protect dw_spi rx/tx to prevent concurrent calls
    
    [ Upstream commit 19b61392c5a852b4e8a0bf35aecb969983c5932d ]
    
    dw_spi_irq() and dw_spi_transfer_one concurrent calls.
    
    I find a panic in dw_writer(): txw = *(u8 *)(dws->tx), when dw->tx==null,
    dw->len==4, and dw->tx_end==1.
    
    When tpm driver's message overtime dw_spi_irq() and dw_spi_transfer_one
    may concurrent visit dw_spi, so I think dw_spi structure lack of protection.
    
    Otherwise dw_spi_transfer_one set dw rx/tx buffer and then open irq,
    store dw rx/tx instructions and other cores handle irq load dw rx/tx
    instructions may out of order.

    phy: cpcap-usb: Prevent USB line glitches from waking up modem
    
    [ Upstream commit 63078b6ba09e842f09df052c5728857389fddcd2 ]
    
    The micro-USB connector on Motorola Mapphone devices can be muxed between
    the SoC and the mdm6600 modem. But even when used for the SoC, configuring
    the PHY with ID pin grounded will wake up the modem from idle state. Looks
    like the issue is probably caused by line glitches.
    
    We can prevent the glitches by using a previously unknown mode of the
    GPIO mux to prevent the USB lines from being connected to the moden while
    configuring the USB PHY, and enable the USB lines after configuring the
    PHY.
    
    Note that this only prevents waking up mdm6600 as regular USB A-host mode,
    and does not help when connected to a lapdock. The lapdock specific issue
    still needs to be debugged separately.

    [ Upstream commit 921162c81a089aa2f442103290f1af9ba281fc9f ]
    
    When the PCM_PARAM IPC fails while configuring the FE, the kernel
    oopses in the HDaudio link DMA .hw_free operation. The root cause is a
    NULL dma_data since the BE .hw_params was never called by the SOC
    core.
    
    This error can also happen if the HDaudio link DMA configuration IPC
    fails in the BE .hw_params.
    
    This patches makes sure the dma_data is properly saved in .hw_params,
    and tested before being use in hw_free.

    If sof_machine_check() fails during driver probe, the IPC
    state is not initialized and this will lead to a NULL
    dereference at driver unload. Example log is as follows:
    
    [ 1535.980630] sof-audio-pci 0000:00:1f.3: error: no matching ASoC machine driver found - aborting probe

    [ Upstream commit 8f18eca9ebc57d6b150237033f6439242907e0ba ]
    
    The Acer SW5-012 2-in-1 keyboard dock uses a Synaptics S91028 touchpad
    which is connected to an ITE 8595 USB keyboard controller chip.
    
    This keyboard has the same quirk for its rfkill / airplane mode hotkey as
    other keyboards with the ITE 8595 chip, it only sends a single release
    event when pressed and released, it never sends a press event.
    
    This commit adds this keyboards USB id to the hid-ite id-table, fixing
    the rfkill key not working on this keyboard.

    rxrpc: Fix use-after-free in rxrpc_receive_data()
    
    [ Upstream commit 122d74fac84204b9a98263636f6f9a3b2e665639 ]
    
    The subpacket scanning loop in rxrpc_receive_data() references the
    subpacket count in the private data part of the sk_buff in the loop
    termination condition.  However, when the final subpacket is pasted into
    the ring buffer, the function is no longer has a ref on the sk_buff and
    should not be looking at sp->* any more.  This point is actually marked in
    the code when skb is cleared (but sp is not - which is an error).
    
    Fix this by caching sp->nr_subpackets in a local variable and using that
    instead.
    
    Also clear 'sp' to catch accesses after that point.
    
    This can show up as an oops in rxrpc_get_skb() if sp->nr_subpackets gets
    trashed by the sk_buff getting freed and reused in the meantime.

    udp: segment looped gso packets correctly
    
    [ Upstream commit 6cd021a58c18a1731f7e47f83e172c0c302d65e5 ]
    
    Multicast and broadcast packets can be looped from egress to ingress
    pre segmentation with dev_loopback_xmit. That function unconditionally
    sets ip_summed to CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY.
    
    udp_rcv_segment segments gso packets in the udp rx path. Segmentation
    usually executes on egress, and does not expect packets of this type.
    __udp_gso_segment interprets !CHECKSUM_PARTIAL as CHECKSUM_NONE. But
    the offsets are not correct for gso_make_checksum.
    
    UDP GSO packets are of type CHECKSUM_PARTIAL, with their uh->check set
    to the correct pseudo header checksum. Reset ip_summed to this type.
    (CHECKSUM_PARTIAL is allowed on ingress, see comments in skbuff.h)

    net_sched: fix ops->bind_class() implementations
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e24cd755552350b94a7617617c6877b8cbcb701 ]
    
    The current implementations of ops->bind_class() are merely
    searching for classid and updating class in the struct tcf_result,
    without invoking either of cl_ops->bind_tcf() or
    cl_ops->unbind_tcf(). This breaks the design of them as qdisc's
    like cbq use them to count filters too. This is why syzbot triggered
    the warning in cbq_destroy_class().
    
    In order to fix this, we have to call cl_ops->bind_tcf() and
    cl_ops->unbind_tcf() like the filter binding path. This patch does
    so by refactoring out two helper functions __tcf_bind_filter()
    and __tcf_unbind_filter(), which are lockless and accept a Qdisc
    pointer, then teaching each implementation to call them correctly.
    
    Note, we merely pass the Qdisc pointer as an opaque pointer to
    each filter, they only need to pass it down to the helper
    functions without understanding it at all.

    net_sched: ematch: reject invalid TCF_EM_SIMPLE
    
    [ Upstream commit 55cd9f67f1e45de8517cdaab985fb8e56c0bc1d8 ]
    
    It is possible for malicious userspace to set TCF_EM_SIMPLE bit
    even for matches that should not have this bit set.
    
    This can fool two places using tcf_em_is_simple()
    
    1) tcf_em_tree_destroy() -> memory leak of em->data
       if ops->destroy() is NULL
    
    2) tcf_em_tree_dump() wrongly report/leak 4 low-order bytes
       of a kernel pointer.

    This can be reliably reproduced by adding the below delay to
    cifs_reconnect(), running find(1) on the mount, restarting the samba
    server while find is running, and killing find during the delay:
    
            spin_unlock(&GlobalMid_Lock);
            mutex_unlock(&server->srv_mutex);
    
     +      msleep(10000);
     +
            cifs_dbg(FYI, "%s: issuing mid callbacks\n", __func__);
            list_for_each_safe(tmp, tmp2, &retry_list) {
                    mid_entry = list_entry(tmp, struct mid_q_entry, qhead);
    
    Fix this by holding a reference to the task struct until the MID is
    freed.

    crypto: chelsio - fix writing tfm flags to wrong place
    
    commit bd56cea012fc2d6381e8cd3209510ce09f9de8c9 upstream.
    
    The chelsio crypto driver is casting 'struct crypto_aead' directly to
    'struct crypto_tfm', which is incorrect because the crypto_tfm isn't the
    first field of 'struct crypto_aead'.  Consequently, the calls to
    crypto_tfm_set_flags() are modifying some other field in the struct.
    
    Also, the driver is setting CRYPTO_TFM_RES_BAD_KEY_LEN in
    ->setauthsize(), not just in ->setkey().  This is incorrect since this
    flag is for bad key lengths, not for bad authentication tag lengths.
    
    Fix these bugs by removing the broken crypto_tfm_set_flags() calls from
    ->setauthsize() and by fixing them in ->setkey().

    driver core: Fix test_async_driver_probe if NUMA is disabled
    
    commit 264d25275a46fce5da501874fa48a2ae5ec571c8 upstream.
    
    Since commit 57ea974fb871 ("driver core: Rewrite test_async_driver_probe
    to cover serialization and NUMA affinity"), running the test with NUMA
    disabled results in warning messages similar to the following.
    
    test_async_driver test_async_driver.12: NUMA node mismatch -1 != 0
    
    If CONFIG_NUMA=n, dev_to_node(dev) returns -1, and numa_node_id()
    returns 0. Both are widely used, so it appears risky to change return
    values. Augment the check with IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_NUMA) instead
    to fix the problem.

    iio: st_gyro: Correct data for LSM9DS0 gyro
    
    commit e825070f697abddf3b9b0a675ed0ff1884114818 upstream.
    
    The commit 41c128cb25ce ("iio: st_gyro: Add lsm9ds0-gyro support")
    assumes that gyro in LSM9DS0 is the same as others with 0xd4 WAI ID,
    but datasheet tells slight different story, i.e. the first scale factor
    for the chip is 245 dps, and not 250 dps.
    
    Correct this by introducing a separate settings for LSM9DS0.

    binder: fix log spam for existing debugfs file creation.
    
    commit eb143f8756e77c8fcfc4d574922ae9efd3a43ca9 upstream.
    
    Since commit 43e23b6c0b01 ("debugfs: log errors when something goes wrong")
    debugfs logs attempts to create existing files.
    
    However binder attempts to create multiple debugfs files with
    the same name when a single PID has multiple contexts, this leads
    to log spamming during an Android boot (17 such messages during
    boot on my system).
    
    Fix this by checking if we already know the PID and only create
    the debugfs entry for the first context per PID.
    
    Do the same thing for binderfs for symmetry.

    The match data does not have to be a struct device pointer, and indeed
    very often is not. Attempt to treat it as such easily results in a
    crash.
    
    For the components that are not registered, we don't know which device
    is missing. Once it it is there, we can use the struct component to get
    the device and whether it's bound or not.

    serial: imx: fix a race condition in receive path
    
    commit 101aa46bd221b768dfff8ef3745173fc8dbb85ee upstream.
    
    The main irq handler function starts by first masking disabled
    interrupts in the status register values to ensure to only handle
    enabled interrupts. This is important as when the RX path in the
    hardware is disabled reading the RX fifo results in an external abort.
    
    This checking must be done under the port lock, otherwise the following
    can happen:
    
         CPU1                            | CPU2
                                         |
         irq triggers as there are chars |
         in the RX fifo                  |
                                         | grab port lock
         imx_uart_int finds RRDY enabled |
         and calls imx_uart_rxint which  |
         has to wait for port lock       |
                                         | disable RX (e.g. because we're
                                         | using RS485 with !RX_DURING_TX)
                                         |
                                         | release port lock
         read from RX fifo with RX       |
         disabled => exception           |
    
    So take the port lock only once in imx_uart_int() instead of in the
    functions called from there.

    serial: 8250_bcm2835aux: Fix line mismatch on driver unbind
    
    commit dc76697d7e933d5e299116f219c890568785ea15 upstream.
    
    Unbinding the bcm2835aux UART driver raises the following error if the
    maximum number of 8250 UARTs is set to 1 (via the 8250.nr_uarts module
    parameter or CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS):
    
    (NULL device *): Removing wrong port: a6f80333 != fa20408b
    
    That's because bcm2835aux_serial_probe() retrieves UART line number 1
    from the devicetree and stores it in data->uart.port.line, while
    serial8250_register_8250_port() instead uses UART line number 0,
    which is stored in data->line.
    
    On driver unbind, bcm2835aux_serial_remove() uses data->uart.port.line,
    which contains the wrong number.  Fix it.
    
    The issue does not occur if the maximum number of 8250 UARTs is >= 2.

    commit d579c43c82f093e63639151625b2139166c730fd upstream.
    
    It appears that the drivers does not go into power save correctly the
    NULL data packets are not being transmitted because it not enabled
    in mac80211.
    
    The driver needs to capture ieee80211_is_nullfunc headers and
    copy the duration_id to it's own duration data header.

    commit d971fdd3412f8342747778fb59b8803720ed82b1 upstream.
    
    It appears that the driver still transmits in CTS protect mode even
    though it is not enabled in mac80211.
    
    That is both packet types PK_TYPE_11GA and PK_TYPE_11GB both use CTS protect.
    The only difference between them GA does not use B rates.
    
    Find if only B rate in GB or GA in protect mode otherwise transmit packets
    as PK_TYPE_11A.

    staging: most: net: fix buffer overflow
    
    commit 4d1356ac12f4d5180d0df345d85ff0ee42b89c72 upstream.
    
    If the length of the socket buffer is 0xFFFFFFFF (max size for an
    unsigned int), then payload_len becomes 0xFFFFFFF1 after subtracting 14
    (ETH_HLEN).  Then, mdp_len is set to payload_len + 16 (MDP_HDR_LEN)
    which overflows and results in a value of 2.  These values for
    payload_len and mdp_len will pass current buffer size checks.
    
    This patch checks if derived from skb->len sum may overflow.
    
    The check is based on the following idea:
    
    For any `unsigned V1, V2` and derived `unsigned SUM = V1 + V2`,
    `V1 + V2` overflows iif `SUM < V1`.
