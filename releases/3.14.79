    mm: thp: fix SMP race condition between THP page fault and MADV_DONTNEED
    
    commit ad33bb04b2a6cee6c1f99fabb15cddbf93ff0433 upstream.
    
    pmd_trans_unstable()/pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad() were
    introduced to locklessy (but atomically) detect when a pmd is a regular
    (stable) pmd or when the pmd is unstable and can infinitely transition
    from pmd_none() and pmd_trans_huge() from under us, while only holding
    the mmap_sem for reading (for writing not).
    
    While holding the mmap_sem only for reading, MADV_DONTNEED can run from
    under us and so before we can assume the pmd to be a regular stable pmd
    we need to compare it against pmd_none() and pmd_trans_huge() in an
    atomic way, with pmd_trans_unstable().  The old pmd_trans_huge() left a
    tiny window for a race.
    
    Useful applications are unlikely to notice the difference as doing
    MADV_DONTNEED concurrently with a page fault would lead to undefined
    behavior.
    
    [js] 3.12 backport: no pmd_devmap in 3.12 yet.

    fix d_walk()/non-delayed __d_free() race
    
    I checked Jari's explanation below and found that v3.14.77 and v3.12.62
    are missing the same fix as 3.10. In fact Al's original commit 3d56c25
    ("fix d_walk()/non-delayed __d_free() race") used to mention to check
    this __d_materialise_dentry() function in the Cc: stable line, but this
    got lost during the backports.
    
    Normally all of our 3 kernels need to apply the following patch that
    Ben correctly put in 3.16 and 3.2. I'm fixing the backport in 3.10.103
    right now.

    s390/sclp_ctl: fix potential information leak with /dev/sclp
    
    commit 532c34b5fbf1687df63b3fcd5b2846312ac943c6 upstream.
    
    The sclp_ctl_ioctl_sccb function uses two copy_from_user calls to
    retrieve the sclp request from user space. The first copy_from_user
    fetches the length of the request which is stored in the first two
    bytes of the request. The second copy_from_user gets the complete
    sclp request, but this copies the length field a second time.
    A malicious user may have changed the length in the meantime.

    ext4: validate that metadata blocks do not overlap superblock
    
    commit 829fa70dddadf9dd041d62b82cd7cea63943899d upstream.
    
    A number of fuzzing failures seem to be caused by allocation bitmaps
    or other metadata blocks being pointed at the superblock.
    
    This can cause kernel BUG or WARNings once the superblock is
    overwritten, so validate the group descriptor blocks to make sure this
    doesn't happen.
