    tracing: Fix bad use of igrab in trace_uprobe.c
    
    commit 0c92c7a3c5d416f47b32c5f20a611dfeca5d5f2e upstream.
    
    As Miklos reported and suggested:
    
      This pattern repeats two times in trace_uprobe.c and in
      kernel/events/core.c as well:
    
          ret = kern_path(filename, LOOKUP_FOLLOW, &path);
          if (ret)
              goto fail_address_parse;
    
          inode = igrab(d_inode(path.dentry));
          path_put(&path);
    
      And it's wrong.  You can only hold a reference to the inode if you
      have an active ref to the superblock as well (which is normally
      through path.mnt) or holding s_umount.
    
      This way unmounting the containing filesystem while the tracepoint is
      active will give you the "VFS: Busy inodes after unmount..." message
      and a crash when the inode is finally put.
    
      Solution: store path instead of inode.
    
    This patch fixes two instances in trace_uprobe.c. struct path is added to
    struct trace_uprobe to keep the inode and containing mount point
    referenced.

    clocksource: Consistent de-rate when marking unstable
    
    commit cd2af07d823e5287cd6c91d54337348c2a873462 upstream.
    
    When a registered clocksource gets marked unstable the watchdog_kthread
    will de-rate and re-select the clocksource. Ensure it also de-rates
    when getting called on an unregistered clocksource.

    clocksource: Initialize cs->wd_list
    
    commit 5b9e886a4af97574ca3ce1147f35545da0e7afc7 upstream.
    
    A number of places relies on list_empty(&cs->wd_list), however the
    list_head does not get initialized. Do so upon registration, such that
    thereafter it is possible to rely on list_empty() correctly reflecting
    the list membership status.

    clocksource: Allow clocksource_mark_unstable() on unregistered clocksources
    
    commit 2aae7bcfa4104b770e6f612356adb8d66c6144d6 upstream.
    
    Because of how the code flips between tsc-early and tsc clocksources
    it might need to mark one or both unstable. The current code in
    mark_tsc_unstable() only worked because previously it registered the
    tsc clocksource once and then never touched it.
    
    Since it now unregisters the tsc-early clocksource, it needs to know
    if a clocksource got unregistered and the current cs->mult test
    doesn't work for that. Instead use list_empty(&cs->list) to test for
    registration.
    
    Furthermore, since clocksource_mark_unstable() needs to place the cs
    on the wd_list, it links the cs->list and cs->wd_list serialization.
    It must not see a clocsource registered (!empty cs->list) but already
    past dequeue_watchdog(). So place {en,de}queue{,_watchdog}() under the
    same lock.
    
    Provided cs->list is initialized to empty, this then allows us to
    unconditionally use clocksource_mark_unstable(), regardless of the
    registration state.

    commit 1bc2463cee92ef0e2034c813d5e511adeb58b5fd upstream.
    
    When the interrupts for a combiner span multiple registers it must be
    checked if any interrupts have been asserted on each register before
    checking for spurious interrupts.
    
    Checking each register seperately leads to false positive warnings.

    x86/tsc: Fix mark_tsc_unstable()
    
    commit e3b4f79025e0a4eb7e2a2c7d24dadfa1e38893b0 upstream.
    
    mark_tsc_unstable() also needs to affect tsc_early, Now that
    clocksource_mark_unstable() can be used on a clocksource irrespective of
    its registration state, use it on both tsc_early and tsc.
    
    This does however require cs->list to be initialized empty, otherwise it
    cannot tell the registation state before registation.

    x86/tsc: Always unregister clocksource_tsc_early
    
    commit e9088adda13cd23249d4b0abb97ff8a81bf5573a upstream.
    
    Don't leave the tsc-early clocksource registered if it errors out
    early.
    
    This was reported by Diego, who on his Core2 era machine got TSC
    invalidated while it was running with tsc-early (due to C-states).
    This results in keeping tsc-early with very bad effects.

    KVM: x86: remove APIC Timer periodic/oneshot spikes
    
    commit ecf08dad723d3e000aecff6c396f54772d124733 upstream.
    
    Since the commit "8003c9ae204e: add APIC Timer periodic/oneshot mode VMX
    preemption timer support", a Windows 10 guest has some erratic timer
    spikes.
    
    Here the results on a 150000 times 1ms timer without any load:
              Before 8003c9ae204e | After 8003c9ae204e
    Max           1834us          |  86000us
    Mean          1100us          |   1021us
    Deviation       59us          |    149us
    Here the results on a 150000 times 1ms timer with a cpu-z stress test:
              Before 8003c9ae204e | After 8003c9ae204e
    Max          32000us          | 140000us
    Mean          1006us          |   1997us
    Deviation      140us          |  11095us
    
    The root cause of the problem is starting hrtimer with an expiry time
    already in the past can take more than 20 milliseconds to trigger the
    timer function.  It can be solved by forward such past timers
    immediately, rather than submitting them to hrtimer_start().
    In case the timer is periodic, update the target expiration and call
    hrtimer_start with it.
    
    v2: Check if the tsc deadline is already expired. Thank you Mika.
    v3: Execute the past timers immediately rather than submitting them to
    hrtimer_start().
    v4: Rearm the periodic timer with advance_periodic_target_expiration() a
    simpler version of set_target_expiration(). Thank you Paolo.

    commit 7fe3fa3b5ec8e75389cce4bf5d052a52e6198d59 upstream.
    
    As reported by Randy Dunlap:
    >> WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for DELL_SMBIOS
    >>   Depends on [m]: X86 [=y] && X86_PLATFORM_DEVICES [=y]
    >>      && (DCDBAS [=m] ||

    >>
    
    Right now it's possible to set dell laptop to compile in but this
    causes dell-smbios to compile in which breaks if dcdbas is a module.
    
    Dell laptop shouldn't select dell-smbios anymore, but depend on it.

    platform/x86: asus-wireless: Fix NULL pointer dereference
    
    commit 9f0a93de9139c2b0a59299cd36b61564522458f8 upstream.
    
    When the module is removed the led workqueue is destroyed in the remove
    callback, before the led device is unregistered from the led subsystem.
    
    This leads to a NULL pointer derefence when the led device is
    unregistered automatically later as part of the module removal cleanup.
    Bellow is the backtrace showing the problem.

    usb: musb: trace: fix NULL pointer dereference in musb_g_tx()
    
    commit 9aea9b6cc78d2b99b23d84fb2e0bc6e464c6569e upstream.
    
    The usb_request pointer could be NULL in musb_g_tx(), where the
    tracepoint call would trigger the NULL pointer dereference failure when
    parsing the members of the usb_request pointer.
    
    Move the tracepoint call to where the usb_request pointer is already
    checked to solve the issue.

    commit 2b63f1329df2cd814c1f8353fae4853ace6521d1 upstream.
    
    musb_start_urb() doesn't check the pass-in parameter if it is NULL.  But
    in musb_bulk_nak_timeout() the parameter passed to musb_start_urb() is
    returned from first_qh(), which could be NULL.

    avoid the potential NULL pointer dereference.

    USB: serial: option: reimplement interface masking
    
    commit c3a65808f04a8426481b63a4fbd9392f009f6330 upstream.
    
    Reimplement interface masking using device flags stored directly in the
    device-id table. This will make it easier to add and maintain device-id
    entries by using a more compact and readable notation compared to the
    current implementation (which manages pairs of masks in separate
    blacklist structs).
    
    Two convenience macros are used to flag an interface as either reserved
    or as not supporting modem-control requests:
    
            { USB_DEVICE(TELIT_VENDOR_ID, TELIT_PRODUCT_ME910_DUAL_MODEM),
              .driver_info = NCTRL(0) | RSVD(3) },
    
    For now, we limit the highest maskable interface number to seven, which
    allows for (up to 16) additional device flags to be added later should
    need arise.
    
    Note that this will likely need to be backported to stable in order to
    make future device-id backports more manageable.

    USB: Accept bulk endpoints with 1024-byte maxpacket
    
    commit fb5ee84ea72c5f1b6cabdd1c9d6e8648995ca7c6 upstream.
    
    Some non-compliant high-speed USB devices have bulk endpoints with a
    1024-byte maxpacket size.  Although such endpoints don't work with
    xHCI host controllers, they do work with EHCI controllers.  We used to
    accept these invalid sizes (with a warning), but we no longer do
    because of an unintentional change introduced by commit aed9d65ac327
    ("USB: validate wMaxPacketValue entries in endpoint descriptors").
    
    This patch restores the old behavior, so that people with these
    peculiar devices can use them without patching their kernels by hand.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix list_del corruption in dwc3_ep_dequeue
    
    commit 96bd39df29c29d348d65311e5954c0b7d3a2a790 upstream.
    
    dwc3_ep_dequeue() waits for completion of End Transfer command using
    wait_event_lock_irq(), which will release the dwc3->lock while waiting
    and reacquire after completion. This allows a potential race condition
    with ep_disable() which also removes all requests from started_list
    and pending_list.
    
    The check for NULL r->trb should catch this but currently it exits to
    the wrong 'out1' label which calls dwc3_gadget_giveback(). Since its
    list entry was already removed, if CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is enabled a
    'list_del corruption' bug is thrown since its next/prev pointers are
    already LIST_POISON1/2. If r->trb is NULL it should simply exit to
    'out0'.

    commit 4842ed5bfcb9daf6660537d70503c18d38dbdbb8 upstream.
    
    If we get an invalid device configuration from a palm 3 type device, we
    might incorrectly parse things, and we have the potential to crash in
    "interesting" ways.
    
    Fix this up by verifying the size of the configuration passed to us by

    KASAN found a use-after-free in xhci_free_virt_device+0x33b/0x38e

            dev->udev->slot_id = 0;
    
    dev->udev will be true even if udev is freed because dev->udev is
    not set to NULL.

    drm/vc4: Make sure vc4_bo_{inc,dec}_usecnt() calls are balanced
    
    commit f7aef1c207092770d06d0df21dceafdca2b49c39 upstream.
    
    Commit b9f19259b84d ("drm/vc4: Add the DRM_IOCTL_VC4_GEM_MADVISE ioctl")
    introduced a mechanism to mark some BOs as purgeable to allow the driver
    to drop them under memory pressure. In order to implement this feature
    we had to add a mechanism to mark BOs as currently used by a piece of
    hardware which materialized through the ->usecnt counter.
    
    Plane code is supposed to increment usecnt when it attaches a BO to a
    plane and decrement it when it's done with this BO, which was done in
    the ->prepare_fb() and ->cleanup_fb() hooks. The problem is, async page
    flip logic does not go through the regular atomic update path, and
    ->prepare_fb() and ->cleanup_fb() are not called in this case.
    
    Fix that by manually calling vc4_bo_{inc,dec}_usecnt() in the
    async-page-flip path.
    
    Note that all this should go away as soon as we get generic async page
    flip support in the core, in the meantime, this fix should do the
    trick.

    btrfs: Take trans lock before access running trans in check_delayed_ref
    
    commit 998ac6d21cfd6efd58f5edf420bae8839dda9f2a upstream.
    
    In preivous patch:
    Btrfs: kill trans in run_delalloc_nocow and btrfs_cross_ref_exist
    We avoid starting btrfs transaction and get this information from
    fs_info->running_transaction directly.
    
    When accessing running_transaction in check_delayed_ref, there's a
    chance that current transaction will be freed by commit transaction
    after the NULL pointer check of running_transaction is passed.
    
    After looking all the other places using fs_info->running_transaction,
    they are either protected by trans_lock or holding the transactions.
    
    Fix this by using trans_lock and increasing the use_count.

    IB/hfi1: Fix NULL pointer dereference when invalid num_vls is used
    
    commit 45d924571a5e1329580811f2419da61b07ac3613 upstream.
    
    When an invalid num_vls is used as a module parameter, the code
    execution follows an exception path where the macro dd_dev_err()
    expects dd->pcidev->dev not to be NULL in hfi1_init_dd(). This
    causes a NULL pointer dereference.
    
    Fix hfi1_init_dd() by initializing dd->pcidev and dd->pcidev->dev
    earlier in the code. If a dd exists, then dd->pcidev and
    dd->pcidev->dev always exists.

    IB/hfi1: Fix loss of BECN with AHG
    
    commit 0a0bcb046b2f0c15b89f8c1b08ad3de601a83c66 upstream.
    
    AHG may be armed to use the stored header, which by design is limited
    to edits in the PSN/A 32 bit word (bth2).
    
    When the code is trying to send a BECN, the use of the stored header
    will lose the BECN bit.
    
    Fix by avoiding AHG when getting ready to send a BECN. This is
    accomplished by always claiming the packet is not a middle packet which
    is an AHG precursor.  BECNs are not a normal case and this should not
    hurt AHG optimizations.

    IB/hfi1: Fix handling of FECN marked multicast packet
    
    commit f59fb9e05109b836230813e45f71c9ecc2d5dbe6 upstream.
    
    The code for handling a marked UD packet unconditionally returns the
    dlid in the header of the FECN marked packet.  This is not correct
    for multicast packets where the DLID is in the multicast range.
    
    The subsequent attempt to send the CNP with the multicast lid will
    cause the chip to halt the ack send context because the source
    lid doesn't match the chip programming.   The send context will
    be halted and flush any other pending packets in the pio ring causing
    the CNP to not be sent.
    
    A part of investigating the fix, it was determined that the 16B work
    broke the FECN routine badly with inconsistent use of 16 bit and 32 bits
    types for lids and pkeys.  Since the port's source lid was correctly 32
    bits the type mixmatches need to be dealt with at the same time as
    fixing the CNP header issue.
    
    Fix these issues by:
    - Using the ports lid for as the SLID for responding to FECN marked UD
      packets
    - Insure pkey is always 16 bit in this and subordinate routines
    - Insure lids are 32 bits in this and subordinate routines

    infiniband: mlx5: fix build errors when INFINIBAND_USER_ACCESS=m
    
    commit b3fe6c62bc66868c45b5bb16050e6bcb333af337 upstream.
    
    Fix build errors when INFINIBAND_USER_ACCESS=m and MLX5_INFINIBAND=y.
    The build error occurs when the mlx5 driver code attempts to use
    USER_ACCESS interfaces, which are built as a loadable module.
    
    Fixes these build errors:

    IB/mlx5: Use unlimited rate when static rate is not supported
    
    commit 4f32ac2e452c2180cd2df581cbadac183e27ecd0 upstream.
    
    Before the change, if the user passed a static rate value different
    than zero and the FW doesn't support static rate,
    it would end up configuring rate of 2.5 GBps.
    
    Fix this by using rate 0; unlimited, in cases where FW
    doesn't support static rate configuration.

    RDMA/ucma: Allow resolving address w/o specifying source address
    
    commit 09abfe7b5b2f442a85f4c4d59ecf582ad76088d7 upstream.
    
    The RDMA CM will select a source device and address by consulting
    the routing table if no source address is passed into
    rdma_resolve_address().  Userspace will ask for this by passing an
    all-zero source address in the RESOLVE_IP command.  Unfortunately
    the new check for non-zero address size rejects this with EINVAL,
    which breaks valid userspace applications.
    
    Fix this by explicitly allowing a zero address family for the source.

    commit 26bff1bd74a4f7417509a83295614e9dab995b2a upstream.
    
    The c4iw_rdev_close() logic was not releasing all the hw
    resources (PBL and RQT memory) during the device removal
    event (driver unload / system reboot). This can cause panic
    in gen_pool_destroy().
    
    The module remove function will wait for all the hw

    xfs: prevent creating negative-sized file via INSERT_RANGE
    
    commit 7d83fb14258b9961920cd86f0b921caaeb3ebe85 upstream.
    
    During the "insert range" fallocate operation, i_size grows by the
    specified 'len' bytes.  XFS verifies that i_size + len < s_maxbytes, as
    it should.  But this comparison is done using the signed 'loff_t', and
    'i_size + len' can wrap around to a negative value, causing the check to
    incorrectly pass, resulting in an inode with "negative" i_size.  This is
    possible on 64-bit platforms, where XFS sets s_maxbytes = LLONG_MAX.
    ext4 and f2fs don't run into this because they set a smaller s_maxbytes.
    
    Fix it by using subtraction instead.
    
    Reproducer:
        xfs_io -f file -c "truncate $(((1<<63)-1))" -c "finsert 0 4096"

    rtlwifi: cleanup 8723be ant_sel definition
    
    commit af8a41cccf8f469165c6debc8fe07c5fd2ca501a upstream.
    
    Some HP laptops have only a single wifi antenna. This would not be a
    problem except that they were shipped with an incorrectly encoded
    EFUSE. It should have been possible to open the computer and transfer
    the antenna connection to the other terminal except that such action
    might void the warranty, and moving the antenna broke the Windows
    driver. The fix was to add a module option that would override the
    EFUSE encoding. That was done with commit c18d8f509571 ("rtlwifi:
    rtl8723be: Add antenna select module parameter"). There was still a
    problem with Bluetooth coexistence, which was addressed with commit
    baa170229095 ("rtlwifi: btcoexist: Implement antenna selection").
    There were still problems, thus there were commit 0ff78adeef11
    ("rtlwifi: rtl8723be: fix ant_sel code") and commit 6d6226928369
    ("rtlwifi: btcoexist: Fix antenna selection code"). Despite all these
    attempts at fixing the problem, the code is not yet right. A proper
    fix is important as there are now instances of laptops having
    RTL8723DE chips with the same problem.
    
    The module parameter ant_sel is used to control antenna number and path.
    At present enum ANT_{X2,X1} is used to define the antenna number, but
    this choice is not intuitive, thus change to a new enum ANT_{MAIN,AUX}
    to make it more readable. This change showed examples where incorrect
    values were used. It was also possible to remove a workaround in
    halbtcoutsrc.c.
    
    The experimental results with single antenna connected to specific path
    are now as follows:
      ant_sel  ANT_MAIN(#1)  ANT_AUX(#2)
         0        -8            -62
         1        -62           -10

    after the first click.
    
    The Samus button keymap and platform data definition are the correct
    ones for Caroline, so they have been reused here.

    scsi: target: Fix fortify_panic kernel exception
    
    commit f5957dade4f373b04fa1f5315a489f18cc2c4cb4 upstream.
    
    memcmp() requires the two buffers passed as arguments to be at least
    'size' bytes long, otherwise a fortify_panic will trigger.
    
    Use memchr_inv() instead of memcmp() to determine whether the received
    payload is zeroed or not.
    
    The bug was found by running a block backstore via LIO.

    tracepoint: Do not warn on ENOMEM
    
    commit d66a270be3310d7aa132fec0cea77d3d32a0ff75 upstream.
    
    Tracepoint should only warn when a kernel API user does not respect the
    required preconditions (e.g. same tracepoint enabled twice, or called
    to remove a tracepoint that does not exist).
    
    Silence warning in out-of-memory conditions, given that the error is
    returned to the caller.
    
    This ensures that out-of-memory error-injection testing does not trigger
    warnings in tracepoint.c, which were seen by syzbot.

    errseq: Always report a writeback error once
    
    commit b4678df184b314a2bd47d2329feca2c2534aa12b upstream.
    
    The errseq_t infrastructure assumes that errors which occurred before
    the file descriptor was opened are of no interest to the application.
    This turns out to be a regression for some applications, notably Postgres.
    
    Before errseq_t, a writeback error would be reported exactly once (as
    long as the inode remained in memory), so Postgres could open a file,
    call fsync() and find out whether there had been a writeback error on
    that file from another process.
    
    This patch changes the errseq infrastructure to report errors to all
    file descriptors which are opened after the error occurred, but before
    it was reported to any file descriptor.  This restores the user-visible
    behaviour.

    ALSA: aloop: Add missing cable lock to ctl API callbacks
    
    commit 76b3421b39bd610546931fc923edcf90c18fa395 upstream.
    
    Some control API callbacks in aloop driver are too lazy to take the
    loopback->cable_lock and it results in possible races of cable access
    while it's being freed.  It eventually lead to a UAF, as reported by
    fuzzer recently.
    
    This patch covers such control API callbacks and add the proper mutex
    locks.

    ALSA: dice: fix kernel NULL pointer dereference due to invalid calculation for array index
    
    commit 52759c0963510a2843774aac9b65ccaed3308dc0 upstream.
    
    At a commit f91c9d7610a ('ALSA: firewire-lib: cache maximum length of
    payload to reduce function calls'), maximum size of payload for tx
    isochronous packet is cached to reduce the number of function calls.
    
    This cache was programmed to updated at a first callback of ohci1394 IR
    context. However, the maximum size is required to queueing packets before
    starting the isochronous context.
    
    As a result, the cached value is reused to queue packets in next time to
    starting the isochronous context. Then the cache is updated in a first
    callback of the isochronous context. This can cause kernel NULL pointer
    dereference in a below call graph:
    
    (sound/firewire/amdtp-stream.c)
    amdtp_stream_start()
    ->queue_in_packet()
      ->queue_packet()
        (drivers/firewire/core-iso.c)
        ->fw_iso_context_queue()
          ->struct fw_card_driver.queue_iso()
          (drivers/firewire/ohci.c)
          = ohci_queue_iso()
            ->queue_iso_packet_per_buffer()
              buffer->pages[page]
    
    The issued dereference occurs in a case that:
     - target unit supports different stream formats for sampling transmission
       frequency.
     - maximum length of payload for tx stream in a first trial is bigger
       than the length in a second trial.
    
    In this case, correct number of pages are allocated for DMA and the 'pages'
    array has enough elements, while index of the element is wrongly calculated
    according to the old value of length of payload in a call of
    'queue_in_packet()'. Then it causes the issue.
    
    This commit fixes the critical bug. This affects all of drivers in ALSA
    firewire stack in Linux kernel v4.12 or later.

    ALSA: seq: Fix races at MIDI encoding in snd_virmidi_output_trigger()
    
    commit 8f22e52528cc372b218b5f100457469615c733ce upstream.
    
    The sequencer virmidi code has an open race at its output trigger
    callback: namely, virmidi keeps only one event packet for processing
    while it doesn't protect for concurrent output trigger calls.
    
    snd_virmidi_output_trigger() tries to process the previously
    unfinished event before starting encoding the given MIDI stream, but
    this is done without any lock.  Meanwhile, if another rawmidi stream
    starts the output trigger, this proceeds further, and overwrites the
    event package that is being processed in another thread.  This
    eventually corrupts and may lead to the invalid memory access if the
    event type is like SYSEX.
    
    The fix is just to move the spinlock to cover both the pending event
    and the new stream.
    
    The bug was spotted by a new fuzzer, RaceFuzzer.

    ALSA: pcm: Check PCM state at xfern compat ioctl
    
    commit f13876e2c33a657a71bcbb10f767c0951b165020 upstream.
    
    Since snd_pcm_ioctl_xfern_compat() has no PCM state check, it may go
    further and hit the sanity check pcm_sanity_check() when the ioctl is
    called right after open.  It may eventually spew a kernel warning, as
    triggered by syzbot, depending on kconfig.
    
    The lack of PCM state check there was just an oversight.  Although
    it's no real crash, the spurious kernel warning is annoying, so let's
    add the proper check.

    ALSA: hda - Fix incorrect usage of IS_REACHABLE()
    
    commit 6a30abaa40b62aed46ef12ea4c16c48565bdb376 upstream.
    
    The commit c469652bb5e8 ("ALSA: hda - Use IS_REACHABLE() for
    dependency on input") simplified the dependencies with IS_REACHABLE()
    macro, but it broke due to its incorrect usage: it should have been
    IS_REACHABLE(CONFIG_INPUT) instead of IS_REACHABLE(INPUT).

    arm64: Add work around for Arm Cortex-A55 Erratum 1024718
    
    commit ece1397cbc89c51914fae1aec729539cfd8bd62b upstream.
    
    Some variants of the Arm Cortex-55 cores (r0p0, r0p1, r1p0) suffer
    from an erratum 1024718, which causes incorrect updates when DBM/AP
    bits in a page table entry is modified without a break-before-make
    sequence. The work around is to skip enabling the hardware DBM feature
    on the affected cores. The hardware Access Flag management features
    is not affected. There are some other cores suffering from this
    errata, which could be added to the midr_list to trigger the work
    around.

    ACPI / button: make module loadable when booted in non-ACPI mode
    
    commit ac1e55b1fdb27c1b07a0a6fe519f1291ff1e7d40 upstream.
    
    Modules such as nouveau.ko and i915.ko have a link time dependency on
    acpi_lid_open(), and due to its use of acpi_bus_register_driver(),
    the button.ko module that provides it is only loadable when booted in
    ACPI mode. However, the ACPI button driver can be built into the core
    kernel as well, in which case the dependency can always be satisfied,
    and the dependent modules can be loaded regardless of whether the
    system was booted in ACPI mode or not.
    
    So let's fix this asymmetry by making the ACPI button driver loadable
    as a module even if not booted in ACPI mode, so it can provide the
    acpi_lid_open() symbol in the same way as when built into the kernel.
