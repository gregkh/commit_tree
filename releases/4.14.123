    NFS: Fix a double unlock from nfs_match,get_client

    Now that nfs_match_client drops the nfs_client_lock, we should be
    careful
    to always return it in the same condition: locked.

    vfio-ccw: Prevent quiesce function going into an infinite loop
    
    [ Upstream commit d1ffa760d22aa1d8190478e5ef555c59a771db27 ]
    
    The quiesce function calls cio_cancel_halt_clear() and if we
    get an -EBUSY we go into a loop where we:
            - wait for any interrupts
            - flush all I/O in the workqueue
            - retry cio_cancel_halt_clear
    
    During the period where we are waiting for interrupts or
    flushing all I/O, the channel subsystem could have completed
    a halt/clear action and turned off the corresponding activity
    control bits in the subchannel status word. This means the next
    time we call cio_cancel_halt_clear(), we will again start by
    calling cancel subchannel and so we can be stuck between calling
    cancel and halt forever.
    
    Rather than calling cio_cancel_halt_clear() immediately after
    waiting, let's try to disable the subchannel. If we succeed in
    disabling the subchannel then we know nothing else can happen
    with the device.

    drm: Wake up next in drm_read() chain if we are forced to putback the event
    
    [ Upstream commit 60b801999c48b6c1dd04e653a38e2e613664264e ]
    
    After an event is sent, we try to copy it into the user buffer of the
    first waiter in drm_read() and if the user buffer doesn't have enough
    room we put it back onto the list. However, we didn't wake up any
    subsequent waiter, so that event may sit on the list until either a new
    vblank event is sent or a new waiter appears. Rare, but in the worst
    case may lead to a stuck process.

    [ Upstream commit 8ca5104715cfd14254ea5aecc390ae583b707607 ]
    
    Building with clang shows a variable that is only used by the

    We commonly fix these by marking the PM functions as __maybe_unused,
    but here that would grow the davinci_mcasp structure, so instead
    add another #ifdef here.

    spi: Fix zero length xfer bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 5442dcaa0d90fc376bdfc179a018931a8f43dea4 ]
    
    This fixes a bug for messages containing both zero length and
    unidirectional xfers.
    
    The function spi_map_msg will allocate dummy tx and/or rx buffers
    for use with unidirectional transfers when the hardware can only do
    a bidirectional transfer.  That dummy buffer will be used in place
    of a NULL buffer even when the xfer length is 0.
    
    Then in the function __spi_map_msg, if he hardware can dma,
    the zero length xfer will have spi_map_buf called on the dummy
    buffer.
    
    Eventually, __sg_alloc_table is called and returns -EINVAL
    because nents == 0.
    
    This fix prevents the error by not using the dummy buffer when
    the xfer length is zero.

    [ Upstream commit 03aa4f191a36f33fce015387f84efa0eee94408e ]
    
    Two saa7146/hexium files contain a construct that causes a warning
    when built with clang:
    
    drivers/media/pci/saa7146/hexium_orion.c:210:12: error: stack frame size of 2272 bytes in function 'hexium_probe'
          [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=]

    static int hexium_attach(struct saa7146_dev *dev, struct saa7146_pci_extension_data *info)
               ^
    
    This one happens regardless of KASAN, and the problem is that a
    constructor to initialize a dynamically allocated structure leads
    to a copy of that structure on the stack, whereas gcc initializes
    it in place.

    [ Upstream commit 2cc12751cf464a722ff57b54d17d30c84553f9c0 ]
    
    Memory allocated via kmemdup might fail and return a NULL pointer.
    This patch adds a check on the return value of kmemdup and passes the
    error upstream.

    dmaengine: tegra210-adma: use devm_clk_*() helpers
    
    [ Upstream commit f6ed6491d565c336a360471e0c29228e34f4380e ]
    
    adma driver is using pm_clk_*() interface for managing clock resources.
    With this it is observed that clocks remain ON always. This happens on
    Tegra devices which use BPMP co-processor to manage clock resources,
    where clocks are enabled during prepare phase. This is necessary because
    clocks to BPMP are always blocking. When pm_clk_*() interface is used on
    such Tegra devices, clock prepare count is not balanced till remove call
    happens for the driver and hence clocks are seen ON always. Thus this
    patch replaces pm_clk_*() with devm_clk_*() framework.

    batman-adv: allow updating DAT entry timeouts on incoming ARP Replies
    
    [ Upstream commit 099e6cc1582dc2903fecb898bbeae8f7cf4262c7 ]
    
    Currently incoming ARP Replies, for example via a DHT-PUT message, do
    not update the timeout for an already existing DAT entry. These ARP
    Replies are dropped instead.
    
    This however defeats the purpose of the DHCPACK snooping, for instance.
    Right now, a DAT entry in the DHT will be purged every five minutes,
    likely leading to a mesh-wide ARP Request broadcast after this timeout.
    Which then recreates the entry. The idea of the DHCPACK snooping is to
    be able to update an entry before a timeout happens, to avoid ARP Request
    flooding.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by updating a DAT entry on incoming
    ARP Replies even if a matching DAT entry already exists. While still
    filtering the ARP Reply towards the soft-interface, to avoid duplicate
    messages on the client device side.

    rcuperf: Fix cleanup path for invalid perf_type strings
    
    [ Upstream commit ad092c027713a68a34168942a5ef422e42e039f4 ]
    
    If the specified rcuperf.perf_type is not in the rcu_perf_init()
    function's perf_ops[] array, rcuperf prints some console messages and
    then invokes rcu_perf_cleanup() to set state so that a future torture
    test can run.  However, rcu_perf_cleanup() also attempts to end the
    test that didn't actually start, and in doing so relies on the value
    of cur_ops, a value that is not particularly relevant in this case.
    This can result in confusing output or even follow-on failures due to
    attempts to use facilities that have not been properly initialized.
    
    This commit therefore sets the value of cur_ops to NULL in this case and
    inserts a check near the beginning of rcu_perf_cleanup(), thus avoiding
    relying on an irrelevant cur_ops value.

    x86/mce: Fix machine_check_poll() tests for error types
    
    [ Upstream commit f19501aa07f18268ab14f458b51c1c6b7f72a134 ]
    
    There has been a lurking "TBD" in the machine check poll routine ever
    since it was first split out from the machine check handler. The
    potential issue is that the poll routine may have just begun a read from
    the STATUS register in a machine check bank when the hardware logs an
    error in that bank and signals a machine check.
    
    That race used to be pretty small back when machine checks were
    broadcast, but the addition of local machine check means that the poll
    code could continue running and clear the error from the bank before the
    local machine check handler on another CPU gets around to reading it.
    
    Fix the code to be sure to only process errors that need to be processed
    in the poll code, leaving other logged errors alone for the machine
    check handler to find and process.

    media: wl128x: prevent two potential buffer overflows
    
    [ Upstream commit 9c2ccc324b3a6cbc865ab8b3e1a09e93d3c8ade9 ]
    
    Smatch marks skb->data as untrusted so it warns that "evt_hdr->dlen"
    can copy up to 255 bytes and we only have room for two bytes.  Even
    if this comes from the firmware and we trust it, the new policy
    generally is just to fix it as kernel hardenning.
    
    I can't test this code so I tried to be very conservative.  I considered
    not allowing "evt_hdr->dlen == 1" because it doesn't initialize the
    whole variable but in the end I decided to allow it and manually
    initialized "asic_id" and "asic_ver" to zero.

    kobject: Don't trigger kobject_uevent(KOBJ_REMOVE) twice.
    
    [ Upstream commit c03a0fd0b609e2f5c669c2b7f27c8e1928e9196e ]
    
    syzbot is hitting use-after-free bug in uinput module [1]. This is because
    kobject_uevent(KOBJ_REMOVE) is called again due to commit 0f4dafc0563c6c49
    ("Kobject: auto-cleanup on final unref") after memory allocation fault
    injection made kobject_uevent(KOBJ_REMOVE) from device_del() from
    input_unregister_device() fail, while uinput_destroy_device() is expecting
    that kobject_uevent(KOBJ_REMOVE) is not called after device_del() from
    input_unregister_device() completed.
    
    That commit intended to catch cases where nobody even attempted to send
    "remove" uevents. But there is no guarantee that an event will ultimately
    be sent. We are at the point of no return as far as the rest of the kernel
    is concerned; there are no repeats or do-overs.
    
    Also, it is not clear whether some subsystem depends on that commit.
    If no subsystem depends on that commit, it will be better to remove
    the state_{add,remove}_uevent_sent logic. But we don't want to risk
    a regression (in a patch which will be backported) by trying to remove
    that logic. Therefore, as a first step, let's avoid the use-after-free bug
    by making sure that kobject_uevent(KOBJ_REMOVE) won't be triggered twice.

    HID: logitech-hidpp: change low battery level threshold from 31 to 30 percent
    
    [ Upstream commit 1f87b0cd32b3456d7efdfb017fcf74d0bfe3ec29 ]
    
    According to hidpp20_batterylevel_get_battery_info my Logitech K270
    keyboard reports only 2 battery levels. This matches with what I've seen
    after testing with batteries at varying level of fullness, it always
    reports either 5% or 30%.
    
    Windows reports "battery good" for the 30% level. I've captured an USB
    trace of Windows reading the battery and it is getting the same info
    as the Linux hidpp code gets.
    
    Now that Linux handles these devices as hidpp devices, it reports the
    battery as being low as it treats anything under 31% as low, this leads
    to the user constantly getting a "Keyboard battery is low" warning from
    GNOME3, which is very annoying.
    
    This commit fixes this by changing the low threshold to anything under
    30%, which I assume is what Windows does.

    cxgb3/l2t: Fix undefined behaviour
    
    [ Upstream commit 76497732932f15e7323dc805e8ea8dc11bb587cf ]
    
    The use of zero-sized array causes undefined behaviour when it is not
    the last member in a structure. As it happens to be in this case.
    
    Also, the current code makes use of a language extension to the C90
    standard, but the preferred mechanism to declare variable-length
    types such as this one is a flexible array member, introduced in
    C99:
    
    struct foo {
            int stuff;
            struct boo array[];
    };
    
    By making use of the mechanism above, we will get a compiler warning
    in case the flexible array does not occur last. Which is beneficial
    to cultivate a high-quality code.

    HID: core: move Usage Page concatenation to Main item
    
    [ Upstream commit 58e75155009cc800005629955d3482f36a1e0eec ]
    
    As seen on some USB wireless keyboards manufactured by Primax, the HID
    parser was using some assumptions that are not always true. In this case
    it's s the fact that, inside the scope of a main item, an Usage Page
    will always precede an Usage.
    
    The spec is not pretty clear as 6.2.2.7 states "Any usage that follows
    is interpreted as a Usage ID and concatenated with the Usage Page".
    While 6.2.2.8 states "When the parser encounters a main item it
    concatenates the last declared Usage Page with a Usage to form a
    complete usage value." Being somewhat contradictory it was decided to
    match Window's implementation, which follows 6.2.2.8.
    
    In summary, the patch moves the Usage Page concatenation from the local
    item parsing function to the main item parsing function.

    scsi: ufs: Avoid configuring regulator with undefined voltage range
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b141e8cfd54ba3e5c610717295b2a02aab26a05 ]
    
    For regulators used by UFS, vcc, vccq and vccq2 will have voltage range
    initialized by ufshcd_populate_vreg(), however other regulators may have
    undefined voltage range if dt-bindings have no such definition.
    
    In above undefined case, both "min_uV" and "max_uV" fields in ufs_vreg
    struct will be zero values and these values will be configured on
    regulators in different power modes.
    
    Currently this may have no harm if both "min_uV" and "max_uV" always keep
    "zero values" because regulator_set_voltage() will always bypass such
    invalid values and return "good" results.
    
    However improper values shall be fixed to avoid potential bugs.  Simply
    bypass voltage configuration if voltage range is not defined.

    scsi: ufs: Fix regulator load and icc-level configuration
    
    [ Upstream commit 0487fff76632ec023d394a05b82e87a971db8c03 ]
    
    Currently if a regulator has "<name>-fixed-regulator" property in device
    tree, it will skip current limit initialization.  This lead to a zero
    "max_uA" value in struct ufs_vreg.
    
    However, "regulator_set_load" operation shall be required on regulators
    which have valid current limits, otherwise a zero "max_uA" set by
    "regulator_set_load" may cause unexpected behavior when this regulator is
    enabled or set as high power mode.
    
    Similarly, in device's icc_level configuration flow, the target icc_level
    shall be updated if regulator also has valid current limit, otherwise a
    wrong icc_level will be calculated by zero "max_uA" and thus causes
    unexpected results after it is written to device.

    The IRQ is requested before the struct rtc is allocated and registered, but
    this struct is used in the IRQ handler. This may lead to a NULL pointer
    dereference.
    
    Switch to devm_rtc_allocate_device/rtc_register_device to allocate the rtc
    struct before requesting the IRQ.

    brcmfmac: fix Oops when bringing up interface during USB disconnect
    
    [ Upstream commit 24d413a31afaee9bbbf79226052c386b01780ce2 ]
    
    Fix a race which leads to an Oops with NULL pointer dereference.  The
    dereference is in brcmf_config_dongle() when cfg_to_ndev() attempts to get
    net_device structure of interface with index 0 via if2bss mapping. This
    shouldn't fail because of check for bus being ready in brcmf_netdev_open(),
    but it's not synchronised with USB disconnect and there is a race: after
    the check the bus can be marked down and the mapping for interface 0 may be
    gone.
    
    Solve this by modifying disconnect handling so that the removal of mapping
    of ifidx to brcmf_if structure happens after netdev removal (which is
    synchronous with brcmf_netdev_open() thanks to rtln being locked in
    devinet_ioctl()). This assures brcmf_netdev_open() returns before the
    mapping is removed during disconnect.

    brcmfmac: fix race during disconnect when USB completion is in progress
    
    [ Upstream commit db3b9e2e1d58080d0754bdf9293dabf8c6491b67 ]
    
    It was observed that rarely during USB disconnect happening shortly after
    connect (before full initialization completes) usb_hub_wq would wait
    forever for the dev_init_lock to be unlocked. dev_init_lock would remain
    locked though because of infinite wait during usb_kill_urb:

    It was traced down to a case where usb_kill_urb would be called on an URB
    structure containing more or less random data, including large number in
    its use_count. During the debugging it appeared that in brcmf_usb_free_q()
    the traversal over URBs' lists is not synchronized with operations on those
    lists in brcmf_usb_rx_complete() leading to handling
    brcmf_usbdev_info structure (holding lists' head) as lists' element and in
    result causing above problem.
    
    Fix it by walking through all URBs during brcmf_cancel_all_urbs using the
    arrays of requests instead of linked lists.

    brcmfmac: fix WARNING during USB disconnect in case of unempty psq
    
    [ Upstream commit c80d26e81ef1802f30364b4ad1955c1443a592b9 ]
    
    brcmu_pkt_buf_free_skb emits WARNING when attempting to free a sk_buff
    which is part of any queue. After USB disconnect this may have happened
    when brcmf_fws_hanger_cleanup() is called as per-interface psq was never
    cleaned when removing the interface.
    Change brcmf_fws_macdesc_cleanup() in a way that it removes the
    corresponding packets from hanger table (to avoid double-free when
    brcmf_fws_hanger_cleanup() is called) and add a call to clean-up the
    interface specific packet queue.
    
    Below is a WARNING during USB disconnect with Raspberry Pi WiFi dongle
    running in AP mode. This was reproducible when the interface was
    transmitting during the disconnect and is fixed with this commit.

    brcmfmac: convert dev_init_lock mutex to completion
    
    [ Upstream commit a9fd0953fa4a62887306be28641b4b0809f3b2fd ]
    
    Leaving dev_init_lock mutex locked in probe causes BUG and a WARNING when
    kernel is compiled with CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING. Convert mutex to completion
    which silences those warnings and improves code readability.
    
    Fix below errors when connecting the USB WiFi dongle:

    b43: shut up clang -Wuninitialized variable warning
    
    [ Upstream commit d825db346270dbceef83b7b750dbc29f1d7dcc0e ]
    
    Clang warns about what is clearly a case of passing an uninitalized
    variable into a static function:
    
    drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/b43/phy_lp.c:1852:23: error: variable 'gains' is uninitialized when used here
          [-Werror,-Wuninitialized]
                    lpphy_papd_cal(dev, gains, 0, 1, 30);
                                        ^~~~~
    drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/b43/phy_lp.c:1838:2: note: variable 'gains' is declared here
            struct lpphy_tx_gains gains, oldgains;
            ^
    1 error generated.
    
    However, this function is empty, and its arguments are never evaluated,
    so gcc in contrast does not warn here. Both compilers behave in a
    reasonable way as far as I can tell, so we should change the code
    to avoid the warning everywhere.
    
    We could just eliminate the lpphy_papd_cal() function entirely,
    given that it has had the TODO comment in it for 10 years now
    and is rather unlikely to ever get done. I'm doing a simpler
    change here, and just pass the 'oldgains' variable in that has
    been initialized, based on the guess that this is what was
    originally meant.

    iio: common: ssp_sensors: Initialize calculated_time in ssp_common_process_data
    
    [ Upstream commit 6f9ca1d3eb74b81f811a87002de2d51640d135b1 ]
    
    When building with -Wsometimes-uninitialized, Clang warns:
    
    drivers/iio/common/ssp_sensors/ssp_iio.c:95:6: warning: variable
    'calculated_time' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false
    [-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
    
    While it isn't wrong, this will never be a problem because
    iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp only uses calculated_time
    on the same condition that it is assigned (when scan_timestamp
    is not zero). While iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp is marked
    as inline, Clang does inlining in the optimization stage, which
    happens after the semantic analysis phase (plus inline is merely
    a hint to the compiler).
    
    Fix this by just zero initializing calculated_time.

    iio: ad_sigma_delta: Properly handle SPI bus locking vs CS assertion
    
    [ Upstream commit df1d80aee963480c5c2938c64ec0ac3e4a0df2e0 ]
    
    For devices from the SigmaDelta family we need to keep CS low when doing a
    conversion, since the device will use the MISO line as a interrupt to
    indicate that the conversion is complete.
    
    This is why the driver locks the SPI bus and when the SPI bus is locked
    keeps as long as a conversion is going on. The current implementation gets
    one small detail wrong though. CS is only de-asserted after the SPI bus is
    unlocked. This means it is possible for a different SPI device on the same
    bus to send a message which would be wrongfully be addressed to the
    SigmaDelta device as well. Make sure that the last SPI transfer that is
    done while holding the SPI bus lock de-asserts the CS signal.

    x86/build: Keep local relocations with ld.lld
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c21383f3429dd70da39c0c7f1efa12377a47ab6 ]
    
    The LLVM linker (ld.lld) defaults to removing local relocations, which
    causes KASLR boot failures. ld.bfd and ld.gold already handle this
    correctly. This adds the explicit instruction "--discard-none" during
    the link phase. There is no change in output for ld.bfd and ld.gold,

    block: sed-opal: fix IOC_OPAL_ENABLE_DISABLE_MBR
    
    [ Upstream commit 78bf47353b0041865564deeed257a54f047c2fdc ]
    
    The implementation of IOC_OPAL_ENABLE_DISABLE_MBR handled the value
    opal_mbr_data.enable_disable incorrectly: enable_disable is expected
    to be one of OPAL_MBR_ENABLE(0) or OPAL_MBR_DISABLE(1). enable_disable
    was passed directly to set_mbr_done and set_mbr_enable_disable where
    is was interpreted as either OPAL_TRUE(1) or OPAL_FALSE(0). The end
    result was that calling IOC_OPAL_ENABLE_DISABLE_MBR with OPAL_MBR_ENABLE
    actually disabled the shadow MBR and vice versa.
    
    This patch adds correct conversion from OPAL_MBR_DISABLE/ENABLE to
    OPAL_FALSE/TRUE. The change affects existing programs using
    IOC_OPAL_ENABLE_DISABLE_MBR but this is typically used only once when
    setting up an Opal drive.

    clk: rockchip: Make rkpwm a critical clock on rk3288
    
    [ Upstream commit dfe7fb21cd9e730230d55a79bc72cf2ece67cdd5 ]
    
    Most rk3288-based boards are derived from the EVB and thus use a PWM
    regulator for the logic rail.  However, most rk3288-based boards don't
    specify the PWM regulator in their device tree.  We'll deal with that
    by making it critical.
    
    NOTE: it's important to make it critical and not just IGNORE_UNUSED
    because all PWMs in the system share the same clock.  We don't want
    another PWM user to turn the clock on and off and kill the logic rail.
    
    This change is in preparation for actually having the PWMs in the
    rk3288 device tree actually point to the proper PWM clock.  Up until
    now they've all pointed to the clock for the old IP block and they've
    all worked due to the fact that rkpwm was IGNORE_UNUSED and that the
    clock rates for both clocks were the same.

    [ Upstream commit 00053de52231117ddc154042549f2256183ffb86 ]
    
    Microphone detection provides the button detection features on the
    Arizona CODECs as such it will be running if the jack is currently
    inserted. If the driver is unbound whilst the jack is still inserted
    this will cause warnings from the regulator framework as the MICVDD
    regulator is put but was never disabled.
    
    Correct this by disabling microphone detection on driver removal and if
    the microphone detection was running disable the regulator and put the
    runtime reference that was currently held.

    clk: rockchip: Fix video codec clocks on rk3288
    
    [ Upstream commit 00c0cd9e59d265b393553e9afa54fee8b10e8158 ]
    
    It appears that there is a typo in the rk3288 TRM.  For
    GRF_SOC_CON0[7] it says that 0 means "vepu" and 1 means "vdpu".  It's
    the other way around.
    
    How do I know?  Here's my evidence:
    
    1. Prior to commit 4d3e84f99628 ("clk: rockchip: describe aclk_vcodec
       using the new muxgrf type on rk3288") we always pretended that we
       were using "aclk_vdpu" and the comment in the code said that this
       matched the default setting in the system.  In fact the default
       setting is 0 according to the TRM and according to reading memory
       at bootup.  In addition rk3288-based Chromebooks ran like this and
       the video codecs worked.
    2. With the existing clock code if you boot up and try to enable the
       new VIDEO_ROCKCHIP_VPU as a module (and without "clk_ignore_unused"
       on the command line), you get errors like "failed to get ack on
       domain 'pd_video', val=0x80208".  After flipping vepu/vdpu things
       init OK.
    3. If I export and add both the vepu and vdpu to the list of clocks
       for RK3288_PD_VIDEO I can get past the power domain errors, but now
       I freeze when the vpu_mmu gets initted.
    4. If I just mark the "vdpu" as IGNORE_UNUSED then everything boots up
       and probes OK showing that somehow the "vdpu" was important to keep
       enabled.  This is because we were actually using it as a parent.
    5. After this change I can hack "aclk_vcodec_pre" to parent from
       "aclk_vepu" using assigned-clocks and the video codec still probes
       OK.
    6. Rockchip has said so on the mailing list [1].
    
    ...so let's fix it.
    
    Let's also add CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT to "aclk_vcodec_pre" as suggested
    by Jonas Karlman.  Prior to the same commit you could do
    clk_set_rate() on "aclk_vcodec" and it would change "aclk_vdpu".
    That's because "aclk_vcodec" was a simple gate clock (always gets
    CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT) and its direct parent was "aclk_vdpu".  After
    that commit "aclk_vcodec_pre" gets in the way so we need to add
    CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT to it too.

    PM / core: Propagate dev->power.wakeup_path when no callbacks
    
    [ Upstream commit dc351d4c5f4fe4d0f274d6d660227be0c3a03317 ]
    
    The dev->power.direct_complete flag may become set in device_prepare() in
    case the device don't have any PM callbacks (dev->power.no_pm_callbacks is
    set). This leads to a broken behaviour, when there is child having wakeup
    enabled and relies on its parent to be used in the wakeup path.
    
    More precisely, when the direct complete path becomes selected for the
    child in __device_suspend(), the propagation of the dev->power.wakeup_path
    becomes skipped as well.
    
    Let's address this problem, by checking if the device is a part the wakeup
    path or has wakeup enabled, then prevent the direct complete path from
    being used.

    mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: add erratum eSDHC-A001 and A-008358 support
    
    [ Upstream commit 05cb6b2a66fa7837211a060878e91be5eb10cb07 ]
    
    eSDHC-A001: The data timeout counter (SYSCTL[DTOCV]) is not
    reliable for DTOCV values 0x4(2^17 SD clock), 0x8(2^21 SD clock),
    and 0xC(2^25 SD clock). The data timeout counter can count from
    2^13–2^27, but for values 2^17, 2^21, and 2^25, the timeout
    counter counts for only 2^13 SD clocks.
    A-008358: The data timeout counter value loaded into the timeout
    counter is less than expected and can result into early timeout
    error in case of eSDHC data transactions. The table below shows
    the expected vs actual timeout period for different values of
    SYSCTL[DTOCV]:
    these two erratum has the same quirk to control it, and set
    SDHCI_QUIRK_RESET_AFTER_REQUEST to fix above issue.

    [ Upstream commit 5dd195522562542bc6ebe6e7bd47890d8b7ca93c ]
    
    In the event of that any data error (like, IRQSTAT[DCE]) occurs
    during an eSDHC data transaction where DMA is used for data
    transfer to/from the system memory, setting the SYSCTL[RSTD]
    register may cause a system hang. If software sets the register
    SYSCTL[RSTD] to 1 for error recovery while DMA transferring is
    not complete, eSDHC may hang the system bus. This happens because
    the software register SYSCTL[RSTD] resets the DMA engine without
    waiting for the completion of pending system transactions. This
    erratum is to fix this issue.

    mmc: core: make pwrseq_emmc (partially) support sleepy GPIO controllers
    
    [ Upstream commit 002ee28e8b322d4d4b7b83234b5d0f4ebd428eda ]
    
    pwrseq_emmc.c implements a HW reset procedure for eMMC chip by driving a
    GPIO line.
    
    It registers the .reset() cb on mmc_pwrseq_ops and it registers a system
    restart notification handler; both of them perform reset by unconditionally
    calling gpiod_set_value().
    
    If the eMMC reset line is tied to a GPIO controller whose driver can sleep
    (i.e. I2C GPIO controller), then the kernel would spit warnings when trying
    to reset the eMMC chip by means of .reset() mmc_pwrseq_ops cb (that is
    exactly what I'm seeing during boot).
    
    Furthermore, on system reset we would gets to the system restart
    notification handler with disabled interrupts - local_irq_disable() is
    called in machine_restart() at least on ARM/ARM64 - and we would be in
    trouble when the GPIO driver tries to sleep (which indeed doesn't happen
    here, likely because in my case the machine specific code doesn't call
    do_kernel_restart(), I guess..).
    
    This patch fixes the .reset() cb to make use of gpiod_set_value_cansleep(),
    so that the eMMC gets reset on boot without complaints, while, since there
    isn't that much we can do, we avoid register the restart handler if the
    GPIO controller has a sleepy driver (and we spit a dev_notice() message to
    let people know)..
    
    This had been tested on a downstream 4.9 kernel with backported
    commit 83f37ee7ba33 ("mmc: pwrseq: Add reset callback to the struct
    mmc_pwrseq_ops") and commit ae60fb031cf2 ("mmc: core: Don't do eMMC HW
    reset when resuming the eMMC card"), because I couldn't boot my board
    otherwise. Maybe worth to RFT.

    scsi: libsas: Do discovery on empty PHY to update PHY info
    
    [ Upstream commit d8649fc1c5e40e691d589ed825998c36a947491c ]
    
    When we discover the PHY is empty in sas_rediscover_dev(), the PHY
    information (like negotiated linkrate) is not updated.
    
    As such, for a user examining sysfs for that PHY, they would see
    incorrect values:
    
    root@(none)$ cd /sys/class/sas_phy/phy-0:0:20
    root@(none)$ more negotiated_linkrate
    3.0 Gbit
    root@(none)$ echo 0 > enable
    root@(none)$ more negotiated_linkrate
    3.0 Gbit
    
    So fix this, simply discover the PHY again, even though we know it's empty;
    in the above example, this gives us:
    
    root@(none)$ more negotiated_linkrate
    Phy disabled
    
    We must do this after unregistering the device associated with the PHY
    (in sas_unregister_devs_sas_addr()).

    [ Upstream commit 81fb8736dd81da3fe94f28968dac60f392ec6746 ]
    
    clock_getres() in the vDSO library has to preserve the same behaviour
    of posix_get_hrtimer_res().
    
    In particular, posix_get_hrtimer_res() does:
    
        sec = 0;
        ns = hrtimer_resolution;
    
    where 'hrtimer_resolution' depends on whether or not high resolution
    timers are enabled, which is a runtime decision.
    
    The vDSO incorrectly returns the constant CLOCK_REALTIME_RES. Fix this
    by exposing 'hrtimer_resolution' in the vDSO datapage and returning that
    instead.

    On platforms where the MUSB and HCI controllers share PHY0, PHY passby
    is required when using the HCI controller with the PHY, but it must be
    disabled when the MUSB controller is used instead.
    
    Without this, PHY0 passby is always enabled, which results in broken

    x86/irq/64: Limit IST stack overflow check to #DB stack

    Commit
    
      37fe6a42b343 ("x86: Check stack overflow in detail")
    
    added a broad check for the full exception stack area, i.e. it considers
    the full exception stack area as valid.
    
    That's wrong in two aspects:
    
     1) It does not check the individual areas one by one
    
     2) #DF, NMI and #MCE are not enabling interrupts which means that a
        regular device interrupt cannot happen in their context. In fact if a
        device interrupt hits one of those IST stacks that's a bug because some
        code path enabled interrupts while handling the exception.
    
    Limit the check to the #DB stack and consider all other IST stacks as
    'overflow' or invalid.

    The SCSI core does not like to have devices or hosts unregistered
    while error recovery is in progress.  Trying to do so can lead to
    self-deadlock: Part of the removal code tries to obtain a lock already
    held by the error handler.
    
    This can cause problems for the usb-storage and uas drivers, because
    their error handler routines perform a USB reset, and if the reset
    fails then the USB core automatically goes on to unbind all drivers
    from the device's interfaces -- all while still in the context of the
    SCSI error handler.
    
    As it turns out, practically all the scenarios leading to a USB reset
    failure end up causing a device disconnect (the main error pathway in
    usb_reset_and_verify_device(), at the end of the routine, calls
    hub_port_logical_disconnect() before returning).  As a result, the
    hub_wq thread will soon become aware of the problem and will unbind
    all the device's drivers in its own context, not in the
    error-handler's context.
    
    This means that usb_reset_device() does not need to call
    usb_unbind_and_rebind_marked_interfaces() in cases where
    usb_reset_and_verify_device() has returned an error, because hub_wq
    will take care of everything anyway.
    
    This particular problem was observed in somewhat artificial
    circumstances, by using usbfs to tell a hub to power-down a port
    connected to a USB-3 mass storage device using the UAS protocol.  With
    the port turned off, the currently executing command timed out and the
    error handler started running.  The USB reset naturally failed,
    because the hub port was off, and the error handler deadlocked as
    described above.  Not carrying out the call to
    usb_unbind_and_rebind_marked_interfaces() fixes this issue.

    cgroup: protect cgroup->nr_(dying_)descendants by css_set_lock
    
    [ Upstream commit 4dcabece4c3a9f9522127be12cc12cc120399b2f ]
    
    The number of descendant cgroups and the number of dying
    descendant cgroups are currently synchronized using the cgroup_mutex.
    
    The number of descendant cgroups will be required by the cgroup v2
    freezer, which will use it to determine if a cgroup is frozen
    (depending on total number of descendants and number of frozen
    descendants). It's not always acceptable to grab the cgroup_mutex,
    especially from quite hot paths (e.g. exit()).
    
    To avoid this, let's additionally synchronize these counters using
    the css_set_lock.
    
    So, it's safe to read these counters with either cgroup_mutex or
    css_set_lock locked, and for changing both locks should be acquired.

    random: add a spinlock_t to struct batched_entropy
    
    [ Upstream commit b7d5dc21072cda7124d13eae2aefb7343ef94197 ]
    
    The per-CPU variable batched_entropy_uXX is protected by get_cpu_var().
    This is just a preempt_disable() which ensures that the variable is only
    from the local CPU. It does not protect against users on the same CPU
    from another context. It is possible that a preemptible context reads
    slot 0 and then an interrupt occurs and the same value is read again.
    
    The above scenario is confirmed by lockdep if we add a spinlock:

    With STRICT_KERNEL_RWX enabled anything marked __init is placed at a 16M
    boundary.  This is necessary so that it can be repurposed later with

    this pushes early_setup past 32M, incapable of being reached by the

    powerpc/numa: improve control of topology updates
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d4d9b308f8f8dec68f6dbbff18c68ec7c6bd26f ]
    
    When booted with "topology_updates=no", or when "off" is written to
    /proc/powerpc/topology_updates, NUMA reassignments are inhibited for
    PRRN and VPHN events. However, migration and suspend unconditionally
    re-enable reassignments via start_topology_update(). This is
    incoherent.
    
    Check the topology_updates_enabled flag in
    start/stop_topology_update() so that callers of those APIs need not be
    aware of whether reassignments are enabled. This allows the
    administrative decision on reassignments to remain in force across
    migrations and suspensions.

    [ Upstream commit c1ced46c7b49ad7bc064e68d966e0ad303f917fb ]
    
    The ctrl_check_input() function is called from pvr2_ctrl_range_check().
    It's supposed to validate user supplied input and return true or false
    depending on whether the input is valid or not.  The problem is that
    negative shifts or shifts greater than 31 are undefined in C.  In
    practice with GCC they result in shift wrapping so this function returns
    true for some inputs which are not valid and this could result in a
    buffer overflow:

    audit: fix a memory leak bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 70c4cf17e445264453bc5323db3e50aa0ac9e81f ]
    
    In audit_rule_change(), audit_data_to_entry() is firstly invoked to
    translate the payload data to the kernel's rule representation. In
    audit_data_to_entry(), depending on the audit field type, an audit tree may
    be created in audit_make_tree(), which eventually invokes kmalloc() to
    allocate the tree.  Since this tree is a temporary tree, it will be then
    freed in the following execution, e.g., audit_add_rule() if the message
    type is AUDIT_ADD_RULE or audit_del_rule() if the message type is
    AUDIT_DEL_RULE. However, if the message type is neither AUDIT_ADD_RULE nor
    AUDIT_DEL_RULE, i.e., the default case of the switch statement, this
    temporary tree is not freed.
    
    To fix this issue, only allocate the tree when the type is AUDIT_ADD_RULE
    or AUDIT_DEL_RULE.

    [ Upstream commit bccb89cf9cd07a0690d519696a00c00a973b3fe4 ]
    
    This driver returns an error if unsupported media bus pixel code is
    requested by VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT.
    
    But according to Documentation/media/uapi/v4l/vidioc-subdev-g-fmt.rst,
    
    Drivers must not return an error solely because the requested format
    doesn't match the device capabilities. They must instead modify the
    format to match what the hardware can provide.
    
    So select default format code and return success in that case.
    
    This is detected by v4l2-compliance.

    If the application was streaming from both videoX and vbiX, and streaming
    from videoX was stopped, then the vbi streaming also stopped.
    
    The cause being that stop_streaming for video stopped the subdevs as well,
    instead of only doing that if dev->streaming_users reached 0.
    
    au0828_stop_vbi_streaming was also wrong since it didn't stop the subdevs

    clk: rockchip: undo several noc and special clocks as critical on rk3288
    
    [ Upstream commit f4033db5b84ebe4b32c25ba2ed65ab20b628996a ]
    
    This is mostly a revert of commit 55bb6a633c33 ("clk: rockchip: mark
    noc and some special clk as critical on rk3288") except that we're
    keeping "pmu_hclk_otg0" as critical still.
    
    NOTE: turning these clocks off doesn't seem to do a whole lot in terms
    of power savings (checking the power on the logic rail).  It appears
    to save maybe 1-2mW.  ...but still it seems like we should turn the
    clocks off if they aren't needed.
    
    About "pmu_hclk_otg0" (the one clock from the original commit we're
    still keeping critical) from an email thread:
    
    > pmu ahb clock
    >
    > Function: Clock to pmu module when hibernation and/or ADP is
    > enabled. Must be greater than or equal to 30 MHz.
    >
    > If the SOC design does not support hibernation/ADP function, only have
    > hclk_otg, this clk can be switched according to the usage of otg.
    > If the SOC design support hibernation/ADP, has two clocks, hclk_otg and
    > pmu_hclk_otg0.
    > Hclk_otg belongs to the closed part of otg logic, which can be switched
    > according to the use of otg.
    >
    > pmu_hclk_otg0 belongs to the always on part.
    >
    > As for whether pmu_hclk_otg0 can be turned off when otg is not in use,
    > we have not tested. IC suggest make pmu_hclk_otg0 always on.
    
    For the rest of the clocks:
    
    atclk: No documentation about this clock other than that it goes to
    the CPU.  CPU functions fine without it on.  Maybe needed for JTAG?
    
    jtag: Presumably this clock is only needed if you're debugging with
    JTAG.  It doesn't seem like it makes sense to waste power for every
    rk3288 user.  In any case to do JTAG you'd need private patches to
    adjust the pinctrl the mux the JTAG out anyway.
    
    pclk_dbg, pclk_core_niu: On veyron Chromebooks we turn these two
    clocks on only during kernel panics in order to access some coresight
    registers.  Since nothing in the upstream kernel does this we should
    be able to leave them off safely.  Maybe also needed for JTAG?
    
    hsicphy12m_xin12m: There is no indication of why this clock would need
    to be turned on for boards that don't use HSIC.
    
    pclk_ddrupctl[0-1], pclk_publ0[0-1]: On veyron Chromebooks we turn
    these 4 clocks on only when doing DDR transitions and they are off
    otherwise.  I see no reason why they'd need to be on in the upstream
    kernel which doesn't support DDRFreq.

    HID: logitech-hidpp: use RAP instead of FAP to get the protocol version
    
    [ Upstream commit 096377525cdb8251e4656085efc988bdf733fb4c ]
    
    According to the logitech_hidpp_2.0_specification_draft_2012-06-04.pdf doc:
    https://lekensteyn.nl/files/logitech/logitech_hidpp_2.0_specification_draft_2012-06-04.pdf
    
    We should use a register-access-protocol request using the short input /
    output report ids. This is necessary because 27MHz HID++ receivers have
    a max-packetsize on their HIP++ endpoint of 8, so they cannot support
    long reports. Using a feature-access-protocol request (which is always
    long or very-long) with these will cause a timeout error, followed by
    the hidpp driver treating the device as not being HID++ capable.
    
    This commit fixes this by switching to using a rap request to get the
    protocol version.
    
    Besides being tested with a (046d:c517) 27MHz receiver with various
    27MHz keyboards and mice, this has also been tested to not cause
    regressions on a non-unifying dual-HID++ nano receiver (046d:c534) with
    k270 and m185 HID++-2.0 devices connected and on a unifying/dj receiver
    (046d:c52b) with a HID++-2.0 Logitech Rechargeable Touchpad T650.

    back in the time when our NMI entry code could not cope with nested NMIs.
    
    These days, it's perfectly fine to take a fault in NMI context and we
    don't have to care about the fact that IRET from the fault handler might
    cause NMI nesting.
    
    This warning has already been removed from 32-bit implementation of
    vmalloc_fault() in:
    
      6863ea0cda8 ("x86/mm: Remove in_nmi() warning from vmalloc_fault()")
    
    but the 64-bit version was omitted.
    
    Remove the bogus warning also from 64-bit implementation of vmalloc_fault().

    smpboot: Place the __percpu annotation correctly
    
    [ Upstream commit d4645d30b50d1691c26ff0f8fa4e718b08f8d3bb ]
    
    The test robot reported a wrong assignment of a per-CPU variable which
    it detected by using sparse and sent a report. The assignment itself is
    correct. The annotation for sparse was wrong and hence the report.
    The first pointer is a "normal" pointer and points to the per-CPU memory
    area. That means that the __percpu annotation has to be moved.
    
    Move the __percpu annotation to pointer which points to the per-CPU
    area. This change affects only the sparse tool (and is ignored by the
    compiler).

    x86/build: Move _etext to actual end of .text
    
    [ Upstream commit 392bef709659abea614abfe53cf228e7a59876a4 ]
    
    When building x86 with Clang LTO and CFI, CFI jump regions are
    automatically added to the end of the .text section late in linking. As a
    result, the _etext position was being labelled before the appended jump
    regions, causing confusion about where the boundaries of the executable
    region actually are in the running kernel, and broke at least the fault
    injection code. This moves the _etext mark to outside (and immediately
    after) the .text area, as it already the case on other architectures
    (e.g. arm64, arm).

    Similarly we do not free the channel program when we are removing
    the vfio-ccw device. Let's fix this by resetting the device and freeing
    the channel program and pinned pages in the release path. For the remove
    path we can just quiesce the device, since in the remove path the mediated
    device is going away for good and so we don't need to do a full reset.

    do not call the function while holding the spinlock.

    This cannot happen in practice because we only enter the loop

    bcache: add failure check to run_cache_set() for journal replay
    
    [ Upstream commit ce3e4cfb59cb382f8e5ce359238aa580d4ae7778 ]
    
    Currently run_cache_set() has no return value, if there is failure in
    bch_journal_replay(), the caller of run_cache_set() has no idea about
    such failure and just continue to execute following code after
    run_cache_set().  The internal failure is triggered inside
    bch_journal_replay() and being handled in async way. This behavior is
    inefficient, while failure handling inside bch_journal_replay(), cache
    register code is still running to start the cache set. Registering and
    unregistering code running as same time may introduce some rare race
    condition, and make the code to be more hard to be understood.
    
    This patch adds return value to run_cache_set(), and returns -EIO if
    bch_journal_rreplay() fails. Then caller of run_cache_set() may detect
    such failure and stop registering code flow immedidately inside
    register_cache_set().
    
    If journal replay fails, run_cache_set() can report error immediately
    to register_cache_set(). This patch makes the failure handling for
    bch_journal_replay() be in synchronized way, easier to understand and
    debug, and avoid poetential race condition for register-and-unregister
    in same time.

    bcache: fix failure in journal relplay
    
    [ Upstream commit 631207314d88e9091be02fbdd1fdadb1ae2ed79a ]
    
    journal replay failed with messages:
    Sep 10 19:10:43 ceph kernel: bcache: error on
    bb379a64-e44e-4812-b91d-a5599871a3b1: bcache: journal entries
    2057493-2057567 missing! (replaying 2057493-2076601), disabling
    caching
    
    The reason is in journal_reclaim(), when discard is enabled, we send
    discard command and reclaim those journal buckets whose seq is old
    than the last_seq_now, but before we write a journal with last_seq_now,
    the machine is restarted, so the journal with the last_seq_now is not
    written to the journal bucket, and the last_seq_wrote in the newest
    journal is old than last_seq_now which we expect to be, so when we doing
    replay, journals from last_seq_wrote to last_seq_now are missing.
    
    It's hard to write a journal immediately after journal_reclaim(),
    and it harmless if those missed journal are caused by discarding
    since those journals are already wrote to btree node. So, if miss
    seqs are started from the beginning journal, we treat it as normal,
    and only print a message to show the miss journal, and point out
    it maybe caused by discarding.
    
    Patch v2 add a judgement condition to ignore the missed journal
    only when discard enabled as Coly suggested.

    bcache: return error immediately in bch_journal_replay()
    
    [ Upstream commit 68d10e6979a3b59e3cd2e90bfcafed79c4cf180a ]
    
    When failure happens inside bch_journal_replay(), calling
    cache_set_err_on() and handling the failure in async way is not a good
    idea. Because after bch_journal_replay() returns, registering code will
    continue to execute following steps, and unregistering code triggered
    by cache_set_err_on() is running in same time. First it is unnecessary
    to handle failure and unregister cache set in an async way, second there
    might be potential race condition to run register and unregister code
    for same cache set.
    
    So in this patch, if failure happens in bch_journal_replay(), we don't
    call cache_set_err_on(), and just print out the same error message to
    kernel message buffer, then return -EIO immediately caller. Then caller
    can detect such failure and handle it in synchrnozied way.

    mwifiex: prevent an array overflow
    
    [ Upstream commit b4c35c17227fe437ded17ce683a6927845f8c4a4 ]
    
    The "rate_index" is only used as an index into the phist_data->rx_rate[]
    array in the mwifiex_hist_data_set() function.  That array has
    MWIFIEX_MAX_AC_RX_RATES (74) elements and it's used to generate some
    debugfs information.  The "rate_index" variable comes from the network
    skb->data[] and it is a u8 so it's in the 0-255 range.  We need to cap
    it to prevent an array overflow.

    is_slave_mode defaults to false because sai structure
    that contains it is kzalloc'ed.
    
    Anyhow, if we decide to set the following configuration
    SAI slave -> SAI master, is_slave_mode will remain set on true
    although SAI being master it should be set to false.
    
    Fix this by updating is_slave_mode for each call of

    libbpf: fix samples/bpf build failure due to undefined UINT32_MAX
    
    [ Upstream commit 32e621e55496a0009f44fe4914cd4a23cade4984 ]
    
    Currently, building bpf samples will cause the following error.
    
        ./tools/lib/bpf/bpf.h:132:27: error: 'UINT32_MAX' undeclared here (not in a function) ..
         #define BPF_LOG_BUF_SIZE (UINT32_MAX >> 8) /* verifier maximum in kernels <= 5.1 */
                                   ^
        ./samples/bpf/bpf_load.h:31:25: note: in expansion of macro 'BPF_LOG_BUF_SIZE'
         extern char bpf_log_buf[BPF_LOG_BUF_SIZE];
                                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    Due to commit 4519efa6f8ea ("libbpf: fix BPF_LOG_BUF_SIZE off-by-one error")
    hard-coded size of BPF_LOG_BUF_SIZE has been replaced with UINT32_MAX which is
    defined in <stdint.h> header.
    
    Even with this change, bpf selftests are running fine since these are built
    with clang and it includes header(-idirafter) from clang/6.0.0/include.
    (it has <stdint.h>)
    
        clang -I. -I./include/uapi -I../../../include/uapi -idirafter /usr/local/include -idirafter /usr/include \
        -idirafter /usr/lib/llvm-6.0/lib/clang/6.0.0/include -idirafter /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu \
        -Wno-compare-distinct-pointer-types -O2 -target bpf -emit-llvm -c progs/test_sysctl_prog.c -o - | \
        llc -march=bpf -mcpu=generic  -filetype=obj -o /linux/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/test_sysctl_prog.o
    
    But bpf samples are compiled with GCC, and it only searches and includes
    headers declared at the target file. As '#include <stdint.h>' hasn't been
    declared in tools/lib/bpf/bpf.h, it causes build failure of bpf samples.
    
        gcc -Wp,-MD,./samples/bpf/.sockex3_user.o.d -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes \
        -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -std=gnu89 -I./usr/include -I./tools/lib/ -I./tools/testing/selftests/bpf/ \

    This commit add declaration of '#include <stdint.h>' to tools/lib/bpf/bpf.h
    to fix this problem.

    mac80211/cfg80211: update bss channel on channel switch
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dc8cdce1d722c733f8c7af14c5fb595cfedbfa8 ]
    
    FullMAC STAs have no way to update bss channel after CSA channel switch
    completion. As a result, user-space tools may provide inconsistent
    channel info. For instance, consider the following two commands:
    $ sudo iw dev wlan0 link
    $ sudo iw dev wlan0 info
    The latter command gets channel info from the hardware, so most probably
    its output will be correct. However the former command gets channel info
    from scan cache, so its output will contain outdated channel info.
    In fact, current bss channel info will not be updated until the
    next [re-]connect.
    
    Note that mac80211 STAs have a workaround for this, but it requires
    access to internal cfg80211 data, see ieee80211_chswitch_work:
    
            /* XXX: shouldn't really modify cfg80211-owned data! */
            ifmgd->associated->channel = sdata->csa_chandef.chan;
    
    This patch suggests to convert mac80211 workaround into cfg80211 behavior
    and to update current bss channel in cfg80211_ch_switch_notify.

    dmaengine: pl330: _stop: clear interrupt status
    
    [ Upstream commit 2da254cc7908105a60a6bb219d18e8dced03dcb9 ]
    
    This patch kill instructs the DMAC to immediately terminate
    execution of a thread. and then clear the interrupt status,
    at last, stop generating interrupts for DMA_SEV. to guarantee
    the next dma start is clean. otherwise, one interrupt maybe leave
    to next start and make some mistake.
    
    we can reporduce the problem as follows:
    
    DMASEV: modify the event-interrupt resource, and if the INTEN sets
    function as interrupt, the DMAC will set irq<event_num> HIGH to
    generate interrupt. write INTCLR to clear interrupt.
    
            DMA EXECUTING INSTRUCTS         DMA TERMINATE
                    |                               |
                    |                               |
                   ...                            _stop
                    |                               |
                    |                       spin_lock_irqsave
                 DMASEV                             |
                    |                               |
                    |                           mask INTEN
                    |                               |
                    |                            DMAKILL
                    |                               |
                    |                       spin_unlock_irqrestore
    
    in above case, a interrupt was left, and if we unmask INTEN, the DMAC
    will set irq<event_num> HIGH to generate interrupt.
    
    to fix this, do as follows:
    
            DMA EXECUTING INSTRUCTS         DMA TERMINATE
                    |                               |
                    |                               |
                   ...                            _stop
                    |                               |
                    |                       spin_lock_irqsave
                 DMASEV                             |
                    |                               |
                    |                            DMAKILL
                    |                               |
                    |                          clear INTCLR
                    |                           mask INTEN

    w1: fix the resume command API
    
    [ Upstream commit 62909da8aca048ecf9fbd7e484e5100608f40a63 ]
    
    >From the DS2408 datasheet [1]:
    "Resume Command function checks the status of the RC flag and, if it is set,
     directly transfers control to the control functions, similar to a Skip ROM
     command. The only way to set the RC flag is through successfully executing
     the Match ROM, Search ROM, Conditional Search ROM, or Overdrive-Match ROM
     command"
    
    The function currently works perfectly fine in a multidrop bus, but when we
    have only a single slave connected, then only a Skip ROM is used and Match
    ROM is not called at all. This is leading to problems e.g. with single one
    DS2408 connected, as the Resume Command is not working properly and the
    device is responding with failing results after the Resume Command.
    
    This commit is fixing this by using a Skip ROM instead in those cases.
    The bandwidth / performance advantage is exactly the same.

    rtc: 88pm860x: prevent use-after-free on device remove
    
    [ Upstream commit f22b1ba15ee5785aa028384ebf77dd39e8e47b70 ]
    
    The device's remove() attempts to shut down the delayed_work scheduled
    on the kernel-global workqueue by calling flush_scheduled_work().
    
    Unfortunately, flush_scheduled_work() does not prevent the delayed_work
    from re-scheduling itself. The delayed_work might run after the device
    has been removed, and touch the already de-allocated info structure.
    This is a potential use-after-free.
    
    Fix by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync() during remove(): this ensures
    that the delayed work is properly cancelled, is no longer running, and
    is not able to re-schedule itself.
    
    This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.

    That's definitely not cool, fix it by outputting an unique error

    not normally happen as the root has been used by the callers in some

    btrfs: fix panic during relocation after ENOSPC before writeback happens

    The way relocation moves data extents is by creating a reloc inode and
    preallocating extents in this inode and then copying the data into these
    preallocated extents.  Once we've done this for all of our extents,
    we'll write out these dirty pages, which marks the extent written, and
    goes into btrfs_reloc_cow_block().  From here we get our current
    reloc_control, which _should_ match the reloc_control for the current
    block group we're relocating.
    
    However if we get an ENOSPC in this path at some point we'll bail out,
    never initiating writeback on this inode.  Not a huge deal, unless we
    happen to be doing relocation on a different block group, and this block
    group is now rc->stage == UPDATE_DATA_PTRS.  This trips the BUG_ON() in
    btrfs_reloc_cow_block(), because we expect to be done modifying the data
    inode.  We are in fact done modifying the metadata for the data inode
    we're currently using, but not the one from the failed block group, and
    thus we BUG_ON().
    
    (This happens when writeback finishes for extents from the previous
    group, when we are at btrfs_finish_ordered_io() which updates the data
    reloc tree (inode item, drops/adds extent items, etc).)
    
    Fix this by writing out the reloc data inode always, and then breaking
    out of the loop after that point to keep from tripping this BUG_ON()
    later.

    Btrfs: fix data bytes_may_use underflow with fallocate due to failed quota reserve
    
    [ Upstream commit 39ad317315887c2cb9a4347a93a8859326ddf136 ]
    
    When doing fallocate, we first add the range to the reserve_list and
    then reserve the quota.  If quota reservation fails, we'll release all
    reserved parts of reserve_list.
    
    However, cur_offset is not updated to indicate that this range is
    already been inserted into the list.  Therefore, the same range is freed
    twice.  Once at list_for_each_entry loop, and once at the end of the
    function.  This will result in WARN_ON on bytes_may_use when we free the
    remaining space.
    
    At the end, under the 'out' label we have a call to:
    
       btrfs_free_reserved_data_space(inode, data_reserved, alloc_start, alloc_end - cur_offset);
    
    The start offset, third argument, should be cur_offset.
    
    Everything from alloc_start to cur_offset was freed by the
    list_for_each_entry_safe_loop.

    When building with -Wunused-but-set-variable, the compiler shouts about

    ARM: vdso: Remove dependency with the arch_timer driver internals
    
    [ Upstream commit 1f5b62f09f6b314c8d70b9de5182dae4de1f94da ]
    
    The VDSO code uses the kernel helper that was originally designed
    to abstract the access between 32 and 64bit systems. It worked so
    far because this function is declared as 'inline'.
    
    As we're about to revamp that part of the code, the VDSO would
    break. Let's fix it by doing what should have been done from
    the start, a proper system register access.

    ACPI / property: fix handling of data_nodes in acpi_get_next_subnode()
    
    [ Upstream commit 23583f7795025e3c783b680d906509366b0906ad ]
    
    When the DSDT tables expose devices with subdevices and a set of
    hierarchical _DSD properties, the data returned by
    acpi_get_next_subnode() is incorrect, with the results suggesting a bad
    pointer assignment. The parser works fine with device_nodes or
    data_nodes, but not with a combination of the two.
    
    The problem is traced to an invalid pointer used when jumping from
    handling device_nodes to data nodes. The existing code looks for data
    nodes below the last subdevice found instead of the common root. Fix
    by forcing the acpi_device pointer to be derived from the same fwnode
    for the two types of subnodes.
    
    This same problem of handling device and data nodes was already fixed
    in a similar way by 'commit bf4703fdd166 ("ACPI / property: fix data
    node parsing in acpi_get_next_subnode()")' but broken later by 'commit
    34055190b19 ("ACPI / property: Add fwnode_get_next_child_node()")', so
    this should probably go to linux-stable all the way to 4.12

    brcm80211: potential NULL dereference in brcmf_cfg80211_vndr_cmds_dcmd_handler()
    
    [ Upstream commit e025da3d7aa4770bb1d1b3b0aa7cc4da1744852d ]
    
    If "ret_len" is negative then it could lead to a NULL dereference.
    
    The "ret_len" value comes from nl80211_vendor_cmd(), if it's negative
    then we don't allocate the "dcmd_buf" buffer.  Then we pass "ret_len" to
    brcmf_fil_cmd_data_set() where it is cast to a very high u32 value.
    Most of the functions in that call tree check whether the buffer we pass
    is NULL but there are at least a couple places which don't such as
    brcmf_dbg_hex_dump() and brcmf_msgbuf_query_dcmd().  We memcpy() to and
    from the buffer so it would result in a NULL dereference.
    
    The fix is to change the types so that "ret_len" can't be negative.  (If
    we memcpy() zero bytes to NULL, that's a no-op and doesn't cause an
    issue).

    spi: pxa2xx: fix SCR (divisor) calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit 29f2133717c527f492933b0622a4aafe0b3cbe9e ]
    
    Calculate the divisor for the SCR (Serial Clock Rate), avoiding
    that the SSP transmission rate can be greater than the device rate.
    
    When the division between the SSP clock and the device rate generates
    a reminder, we have to increment by one the divisor.
    In this way the resulting SSP clock will never be greater than the
    device SPI max frequency.
    
    For example, with:
    
     - ssp_clk  = 50 MHz
     - dev freq = 15 MHz
    
    without this patch the SSP clock will be greater than 15 MHz:
    
     - 25 MHz for PXA25x_SSP and CE4100_SSP
     - 16,56 MHz for the others
    
    Instead, with this patch, we have in both case an SSP clock of 12.5MHz,
    so the max rate of the SPI device clock is respected.

    ASoC: imx: fix fiq dependencies
    
    [ Upstream commit ea751227c813ab833609afecfeedaf0aa26f327e ]
    
    During randconfig builds, I occasionally run into an invalid configuration
    of the freescale FIQ sound support:
    
    WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SND_SOC_IMX_PCM_FIQ
      Depends on [m]: SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && SND_IMX_SOC [=m]

    sound/soc/fsl/imx-ssi.o: In function `imx_ssi_probe':
    imx-ssi.c:(.text+0xa64): undefined reference to `imx_pcm_fiq_init'
    
    The Kconfig warning is a result of the symbol being defined inside of
    the "if SND_IMX_SOC" block, and is otherwise harmless. The link error
    is more tricky and happens with SND_SOC_IMX_SSI=y, which may or may not
    imply FIQ support. However, if SND_SOC_FSL_SSI is set to =m at the same
    time, that selects SND_SOC_IMX_PCM_FIQ as a loadable module dependency,
    which then causes a link failure from imx-ssi.
    
    The solution here is to make SND_SOC_IMX_PCM_FIQ built-in whenever
    one of its potential users is built-in.

    net: ena: gcc 8: fix compilation warning
    
    [ Upstream commit f913308879bc6ae437ce64d878c7b05643ddea44 ]
    
    GCC 8 contains a number of new warnings as well as enhancements to existing
    checkers. The warning - Wstringop-truncation - warns for calls to bounded
    string manipulation functions such as strncat, strncpy, and stpncpy that
    may either truncate the copied string or leave the destination unchanged.
    
    In our case the destination string length (32 bytes) is much shorter than
    the source string (64 bytes) which causes this warning to show up. In
    general the destination has to be at least a byte larger than the length
    of the source string with strncpy for this warning not to showup.
    
    This can be easily fixed by using strlcpy instead which already does the
    truncation to the string. Documentation for this function can be
    found here:

    Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception
    ==========================================================================
    
    In device probe(), of_dma_controller_register() registers DMA controller.
    But when driver is removed, this is not freed. During driver reload this
    results in data abort and kernel panic. Add of_dma_controller_free() in
    driver remove path to fix the issue.

    mmc: core: Verify SD bus width
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e4be8d03f50d1b25c38e2b59e73b194c130df7d ]
    
    The SD Physical Layer Spec says the following: Since the SD Memory Card
    shall support at least the two bus modes 1-bit or 4-bit width, then any SD
    Card shall set at least bits 0 and 2 (SD_BUS_WIDTH="0101").
    
    This change verifies the card has specified a bus width.
    
    AMD SDHC Device 7806 can get into a bad state after a card disconnect
    where anything transferred via the DATA lines will always result in a
    zero filled buffer. Currently the driver will continue without error if
    the HC is in this condition. A block device will be created, but reading
    from it will result in a zero buffer. This makes it seem like the SD
    device has been erased, when in actuality the data is never getting
    copied from the DATA lines to the data buffer.
    
    SCR is the first command in the SD initialization sequence that uses the
    DATA lines. By checking that the response was invalid, we can abort
    mounting the card.

    gfs2: Fix occasional glock use-after-free
    
    [ Upstream commit 9287c6452d2b1f24ea8e84bd3cf6f3c6f267f712 ]
    
    This patch has to do with the life cycle of glocks and buffers.  When
    gfs2 metadata or journaled data is queued to be written, a gfs2_bufdata
    object is assigned to track the buffer, and that is queued to various
    lists, including the glock's gl_ail_list to indicate it's on the active
    items list.  Once the page associated with the buffer has been written,
    it is removed from the ail list, but its life isn't over until a revoke
    has been successfully written.
    
    So after the block is written, its bufdata object is moved from the
    glock's gl_ail_list to a file-system-wide list of pending revokes,
    sd_log_le_revoke.  At that point the glock still needs to track how many
    revokes it contributed to that list (in gl_revokes) so that things like
    glock go_sync can ensure all the metadata has been not only written, but
    also revoked before the glock is granted to a different node.  This is
    to guarantee journal replay doesn't replay the block once the glock has
    been granted to another node.
    
    Ross Lagerwall recently discovered a race in which an inode could be
    evicted, and its glock freed after its ail list had been synced, but
    while it still had unwritten revokes on the sd_log_le_revoke list.  The
    evict decremented the glock reference count to zero, which allowed the
    glock to be freed.  After the revoke was written, function
    revoke_lo_after_commit tried to adjust the glock's gl_revokes counter
    and clear its GLF_LFLUSH flag, at which time it referenced the freed
    glock.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by incrementing the glock reference count
    in gfs2_add_revoke when the glock's first bufdata object is moved from
    the glock to the global revokes list. Later, when the glock's last such
    bufdata object is freed, the reference count is decremented. This
    guarantees that whichever process finishes last (the revoke writing or
    the evict) will properly free the glock, and neither will reference the
    glock after it has been freed.

    IB/hfi1: Fix WQ_MEM_RECLAIM warning
    
    [ Upstream commit 4c4b1996b5db688e2dcb8242b0a3bf7b1e845e42 ]
    
    The work_item cancels that occur when a QP is destroyed can elicit the

    Since QP destruction frees memory, hfi1_wq should have the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM.
    
    The hfi1_wq does not allocate memory with GFP_KERNEL or otherwise become
    entangled with memory reclaim, so this flag is appropriate.

    gfs2: Fix lru_count going negative
    
    [ Upstream commit 7881ef3f33bb80f459ea6020d1e021fc524a6348 ]
    
    Under certain conditions, lru_count may drop below zero resulting in
    a large amount of log spam like this:
    
    vmscan: shrink_slab: gfs2_dump_glock+0x3b0/0x630 [gfs2] \
        negative objects to delete nr=-1
    
    This happens as follows:
    1) A glock is moved from lru_list to the dispose list and lru_count is
       decremented.
    2) The dispose function calls cond_resched() and drops the lru lock.
    3) Another thread takes the lru lock and tries to add the same glock to
       lru_list, checking if the glock is on an lru list.
    4) It is on a list (actually the dispose list) and so it avoids
       incrementing lru_count.
    5) The glock is moved to lru_list.
    5) The original thread doesn't dispose it because it has been re-added
       to the lru list but the lru_count has still decreased by one.
    
    Fix by checking if the LRU flag is set on the glock rather than checking
    if the glock is on some list and rearrange the code so that the LRU flag
    is added/removed precisely when the glock is added/removed from lru_list.

    Revert "btrfs: Honour FITRIM range constraints during free space trim"
    
    This reverts commit b327ff8a9b5767ce39db650d468fb124b48974a5.
    
    There is currently no corresponding patch in master due to additional
    changes that would be significantly different from plain revert in the
    respective stable branch.
    
    The range argument was not handled correctly and could cause trim to
    overlap allocated areas or reach beyond the end of the device. The
    address space that fitrim normally operates on is in logical
    coordinates, while the discards are done on the physical device extents.
    This distinction cannot be made with the current ioctl interface and
    caused the confusion.
    
    The bug depends on the layout of block groups and does not always
    happen. The whole-fs trim (run by default by the fstrim tool) is not
    affected.

    batman-adv: mcast: fix multicast tt/tvlv worker locking
    
    commit a3c7cd0cdf1107f891aff847ad481e34df727055 upstream.
    
    Syzbot has reported some issues with the locking assumptions made for
    the multicast tt/tvlv worker: It was able to trigger the WARN_ON() in
    batadv_mcast_mla_tt_retract() and batadv_mcast_mla_tt_add().
    While hard/not reproduceable for us so far it seems that the
    delayed_work_pending() we use might not be quite safe from reordering.
    
    Therefore this patch adds an explicit, new spinlock to protect the
    update of the mla_list and flags in bat_priv and then removes the
    WARN_ON(delayed_work_pending()).

    bpf: devmap: fix use-after-free Read in __dev_map_entry_free
    
    commit 2baae3545327632167c0180e9ca1d467416f1919 upstream.
    
    synchronize_rcu() is fine when the rcu callbacks only need
    to free memory (kfree_rcu() or direct kfree() call rcu call backs)
    
    __dev_map_entry_free() is a bit more complex, so we need to make
    sure that call queued __dev_map_entry_free() callbacks have completed.

    In ssb_modinit, it does not fail SSB init when ssb_host_pcmcia_init failed,
    however in ssb_modexit, ssb_host_pcmcia_exit calls pcmcia_unregister_driver
    unconditionally, which may tigger a NULL pointer dereference issue as above.

    media: vivid: use vfree() instead of kfree() for dev->bitmap_cap
    
    commit dad7e270ba712ba1c99cd2d91018af6044447a06 upstream.
    
    syzkaller reported crashes on kfree() called from
    vivid_vid_cap_s_selection(). This looks like a simple typo, as
    dev->bitmap_cap is allocated with vzalloc() throughout the file.

    btrfs: honor path->skip_locking in backref code
    
    commit 38e3eebff643db725633657d1d87a3be019d1018 upstream.
    
    Qgroups will do the old roots lookup at delayed ref time, which could be
    while walking down the extent root while running a delayed ref.  This
    should be fine, except we specifically lock eb's in the backref walking
    code irrespective of path->skip_locking, which deadlocks the system.
    Fix up the backref code to honor path->skip_locking, nobody will be
    modifying the commit_root when we're searching so it's completely safe
    to do.
    
    This happens since fb235dc06fac ("btrfs: qgroup: Move half of the qgroup
    accounting time out of commit trans"), kernel may lockup with quota
    enabled.
    
    There is one backref trace triggered by snapshot dropping along with
    write operation in the source subvolume.  The example can be reliably
    reproduced:
    
      btrfs-cleaner   D    0  4062      2 0x80000000
      Call Trace:

       kthread+0x112/0x130
       ret_from_fork+0x27/0x50
    
    When dropping snapshots with qgroup enabled, we will trigger backref
    walk.
    
    However such backref walk at that timing is pretty dangerous, as if one
    of the parent nodes get WRITE locked by other thread, we could cause a
    dead lock.
    
    For example:
    
               FS 260     FS 261 (Dropped)
                node A        node B
               /      \      /      \
           node C      node D      node E
          /   \         /  \        /     \
      leaf F|leaf G|leaf H|leaf I|leaf J|leaf K
    
    The lock sequence would be:
    
          Thread A (cleaner)             |       Thread B (other writer)
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    write_lock(B)                        |
    write_lock(D)                        |
    ^^^ called by walk_down_tree()       |
                                         |       write_lock(A)
                                         |       write_lock(D) << Stall
    read_lock(H) << for backref walk     |
    read_lock(D) << lock owner is        |
                    the same thread A    |
                    so read lock is OK   |
    read_lock(A) << Stall                |
    
    So thread A hold write lock D, and needs read lock A to unlock.
    While thread B holds write lock A, while needs lock D to unlock.
    
    This will cause a deadlock.
    
    This is not only limited to snapshot dropping case.  As the backref
    walk, even only happens on commit trees, is breaking the normal top-down
    locking order, makes it deadlock prone.

    brcmfmac: add subtype check for event handling in data path
    
    commit a4176ec356c73a46c07c181c6d04039fafa34a9f upstream.
    
    For USB there is no separate channel being used to pass events
    from firmware to the host driver and as such are passed over the
    data path. In order to detect mock event messages an additional
    check is needed on event subtype. This check is added conditionally
    using unlikely() keyword.

    hugetlb: use same fault hash key for shared and private mappings
    
    commit 1b426bac66e6cc83c9f2d92b96e4e72acf43419a upstream.
    
    hugetlb uses a fault mutex hash table to prevent page faults of the
    same pages concurrently.  The key for shared and private mappings is
    different.  Shared keys off address_space and file index.  Private keys
    off mm and virtual address.  Consider a private mappings of a populated
    hugetlbfs file.  A fault will map the page from the file and if needed
    do a COW to map a writable page.
    
    Hugetlbfs hole punch uses the fault mutex to prevent mappings of file
    pages.  It uses the address_space file index key.  However, private
    mappings will use a different key and could race with this code to map
    the file page.  This causes problems (BUG) for the page cache remove
    code as it expects the page to be unmapped.  A sample stack is:
    
    page dumped because: VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_mapped(page))
    kernel BUG at mm/filemap.c:169!
    ...
    RIP: 0010:unaccount_page_cache_page+0x1b8/0x200

    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9
    
    There seems to be another potential COW issue/race with this approach
    of different private and shared keys as noted in commit 8382d914ebf7
    ("mm, hugetlb: improve page-fault scalability").
    
    Since every hugetlb mapping (even anon and private) is actually a file
    mapping, just use the address_space index key for all mappings.  This
    results in potentially more hash collisions.  However, this should not
    be the common case.

    btrfs: sysfs: don't leak memory when failing add fsid
    
    commit e32773357d5cc271b1d23550b3ed026eb5c2a468 upstream.
    
    A failed call to kobject_init_and_add() must be followed by a call to
    kobject_put().  Currently in the error path when adding fs_devices we
    are missing this call.  This could be fixed by calling
    btrfs_sysfs_remove_fsid() if btrfs_sysfs_add_fsid() returns an error or
    by adding a call to kobject_put() directly in btrfs_sysfs_add_fsid().
    Here we choose the second option because it prevents the slightly
    unusual error path handling requirements of kobject from leaking out
    into btrfs functions.
    
    Add a call to kobject_put() in the error path of kobject_add_and_init().
    This causes the release method to be called if kobject_init_and_add()
    fails.  open_tree() is the function that calls btrfs_sysfs_add_fsid()
    and the error code in this function is already written with the
    assumption that the release method is called during the error path of
    open_tree() (as seen by the call to btrfs_sysfs_remove_fsid() under the
    fail_fsdev_sysfs label).

    btrfs: sysfs: Fix error path kobject memory leak
    
    commit 450ff8348808a89cc27436771aa05c2b90c0eef1 upstream.
    
    If a call to kobject_init_and_add() fails we must call kobject_put()
    otherwise we leak memory.
    
    Calling kobject_put() when kobject_init_and_add() fails drops the
    refcount back to 0 and calls the ktype release method (which in turn
    calls the percpu destroy and kfree).
    
    Add call to kobject_put() in the error path of call to
    kobject_init_and_add().

    Btrfs: fix race between ranged fsync and writeback of adjacent ranges
    
    commit 0c713cbab6200b0ab6473b50435e450a6e1de85d upstream.
    
    When we do a full fsync (the bit BTRFS_INODE_NEEDS_FULL_SYNC is set in the
    inode) that happens to be ranged, which happens during a msync() or writes
    for files opened with O_SYNC for example, we can end up with a corrupt log,
    due to different file extent items representing ranges that overlap with
    each other, or hit some assertion failures.
    
    When doing a ranged fsync we only flush delalloc and wait for ordered
    exents within that range. If while we are logging items from our inode
    ordered extents for adjacent ranges complete, we end up in a race that can
    make us insert the file extent items that overlap with others we logged
    previously and the assertion failures.
    
    For example, if tree-log.c:copy_items() receives a leaf that has the
    following file extents items, all with a length of 4K and therefore there
    is an implicit hole in the range 68K to 72K - 1:
    
      (257 EXTENT_ITEM 64K), (257 EXTENT_ITEM 72K), (257 EXTENT_ITEM 76K), ...
    
    It copies them to the log tree. However due to the need to detect implicit
    holes, it may release the path, in order to look at the previous leaf to
    detect an implicit hole, and then later it will search again in the tree
    for the first file extent item key, with the goal of locking again the
    leaf (which might have changed due to concurrent changes to other inodes).
    
    However when it locks again the leaf containing the first key, the key
    corresponding to the extent at offset 72K may not be there anymore since
    there is an ordered extent for that range that is finishing (that is,
    somewhere in the middle of btrfs_finish_ordered_io()), and it just
    removed the file extent item but has not yet replaced it with a new file
    extent item, so the part of copy_items() that does hole detection will
    decide that there is a hole in the range starting from 68K to 76K - 1,
    and therefore insert a file extent item to represent that hole, having
    a key offset of 68K. After that we now have a log tree with 2 different
    extent items that have overlapping ranges:
    
     1) The file extent item copied before copy_items() released the path,
        which has a key offset of 72K and a length of 4K, representing the
        file range 72K to 76K - 1.
    
     2) And a file extent item representing a hole that has a key offset of
        68K and a length of 8K, representing the range 68K to 76K - 1. This
        item was inserted after releasing the path, and overlaps with the
        extent item inserted before.
    
    The overlapping extent items can cause all sorts of unpredictable and
    incorrect behaviour, either when replayed or if a fast (non full) fsync
    happens later, which can trigger a BUG_ON() when calling
    btrfs_set_item_key_safe() through __btrfs_drop_extents(), producing a
    trace like the following:

    A sample of a corrupt log tree leaf with overlapping extents I got from
    running btrfs/072:
    
          item 14 key (295 108 200704) itemoff 2599 itemsize 53
                  extent data disk bytenr 0 nr 0
                  extent data offset 0 nr 458752 ram 458752
          item 15 key (295 108 659456) itemoff 2546 itemsize 53
                  extent data disk bytenr 4343541760 nr 770048
                  extent data offset 606208 nr 163840 ram 770048
          item 16 key (295 108 663552) itemoff 2493 itemsize 53
                  extent data disk bytenr 4343541760 nr 770048
                  extent data offset 610304 nr 155648 ram 770048
          item 17 key (295 108 819200) itemoff 2440 itemsize 53
                  extent data disk bytenr 4334788608 nr 4096
                  extent data offset 0 nr 4096 ram 4096
    
    The file extent item at offset 659456 (item 15) ends at offset 823296
    (659456 + 163840) while the next file extent item (item 16) starts at
    offset 663552.
    
    Another different problem that the race can trigger is a failure in the
    assertions at tree-log.c:copy_items(), which expect that the first file
    extent item key we found before releasing the path exists after we have
    released path and that the last key we found before releasing the path
    also exists after releasing the path:
    
      $ cat -n fs/btrfs/tree-log.c
      4080          if (need_find_last_extent) {
      4081                  /* btrfs_prev_leaf could return 1 without releasing the path */
      4082                  btrfs_release_path(src_path);
      4083                  ret = btrfs_search_slot(NULL, inode->root, &first_key,
      4084                                  src_path, 0, 0);
      4085                  if (ret < 0)
      4086                          return ret;
      4087                  ASSERT(ret == 0);
      (...)
      4103                  if (i >= btrfs_header_nritems(src_path->nodes[0])) {
      4104                          ret = btrfs_next_leaf(inode->root, src_path);
      4105                          if (ret < 0)
      4106                                  return ret;
      4107                          ASSERT(ret == 0);
      4108                          src = src_path->nodes[0];
      4109                          i = 0;
      4110                          need_find_last_extent = true;
      4111                  }
      (...)
    
    The second assertion implicitly expects that the last key before the path
    release still exists, because the surrounding while loop only stops after
    we have found that key. When this assertion fails it produces a stack like
    this:
    
      [139590.037075] assertion failed: ret == 0, file: fs/btrfs/tree-log.c, line: 4107

    So fix this race between a full ranged fsync and writeback of adjacent
    ranges by flushing all delalloc and waiting for all ordered extents to
    complete before logging the inode. This is the simplest way to solve the
    problem because currently the full fsync path does not deal with ranges
    at all (it assumes a full range from 0 to LLONG_MAX) and it always needs
    to look at adjacent ranges for hole detection. For use cases of ranged
    fsyncs this can make a few fsyncs slower but on the other hand it can
    make some following fsyncs to other ranges do less work or no need to do
    anything at all. A full fsync is rare anyway and happens only once after
    loading/creating an inode and once after less common operations such as a
    shrinking truncate.
    
    This is an issue that exists for a long time, and was often triggered by
    generic/127, because it does mmap'ed writes and msync (which triggers a
    ranged fsync). Adding support for the tree checker to detect overlapping
    extents (next patch in the series) and trigger a WARN() when such cases
    are found, and then calling btrfs_check_leaf_full() at the end of
    btrfs_insert_file_extent() made the issue much easier to detect. Running
    btrfs/072 with that change to the tree checker and making fsstress open
    files always with O_SYNC made it much easier to trigger the issue (as
    triggering it with generic/127 is very rare).

    Btrfs: avoid fallback to transaction commit during fsync of files with holes
    
    commit ebb929060aeb162417b4c1307e63daee47b208d9 upstream.
    
    When we are doing a full fsync (bit BTRFS_INODE_NEEDS_FULL_SYNC set) of a
    file that has holes and has file extent items spanning two or more leafs,
    we can end up falling to back to a full transaction commit due to a logic
    bug that leads to failure to insert a duplicate file extent item that is
    meant to represent a hole between the last file extent item of a leaf and
    the first file extent item in the next leaf. The failure (EEXIST error)
    leads to a transaction commit (as most errors when logging an inode do).
    
    For example, we have the two following leafs:
    
    Leaf N:
    
      -----------------------------------------------
      | ..., ..., ..., (257, FILE_EXTENT_ITEM, 64K) |
      -----------------------------------------------
      The file extent item at the end of leaf N has a length of 4Kb,
      representing the file range from 64K to 68K - 1.
    
    Leaf N + 1:
    
      -----------------------------------------------
      | (257, FILE_EXTENT_ITEM, 72K), ..., ..., ... |
      -----------------------------------------------
      The file extent item at the first slot of leaf N + 1 has a length of
      4Kb too, representing the file range from 72K to 76K - 1.
    
    During the full fsync path, when we are at tree-log.c:copy_items() with
    leaf N as a parameter, after processing the last file extent item, that
    represents the extent at offset 64K, we take a look at the first file
    extent item at the next leaf (leaf N + 1), and notice there's a 4K hole
    between the two extents, and therefore we insert a file extent item
    representing that hole, starting at file offset 68K and ending at offset
    72K - 1. However we don't update the value of *last_extent, which is used
    to represent the end offset (plus 1, non-inclusive end) of the last file
    extent item inserted in the log, so it stays with a value of 68K and not
    with a value of 72K.
    
    Then, when copy_items() is called for leaf N + 1, because the value of
    *last_extent is smaller then the offset of the first extent item in the
    leaf (68K < 72K), we look at the last file extent item in the previous
    leaf (leaf N) and see it there's a 4K gap between it and our first file
    extent item (again, 68K < 72K), so we decide to insert a file extent item
    representing the hole, starting at file offset 68K and ending at offset
    72K - 1, this insertion will fail with -EEXIST being returned from
    btrfs_insert_file_extent() because we already inserted a file extent item
    representing a hole for this offset (68K) in the previous call to
    copy_items(), when processing leaf N.
    
    The -EEXIST error gets propagated to the fsync callback, btrfs_sync_file(),
    which falls back to a full transaction commit.
    
    Fix this by adjusting *last_extent after inserting a hole when we had to
    look at the next leaf.

    Btrfs: do not abort transaction at btrfs_update_root() after failure to COW path
    
    commit 72bd2323ec87722c115a5906bc6a1b31d11e8f54 upstream.
    
    Currently when we fail to COW a path at btrfs_update_root() we end up
    always aborting the transaction. However all the current callers of
    btrfs_update_root() are able to deal with errors returned from it, many do
    end up aborting the transaction themselves (directly or not, such as the
    transaction commit path), other BUG_ON() or just gracefully cancel whatever
    they were doing.
    
    When syncing the fsync log, we call btrfs_update_root() through
    tree-log.c:update_log_root(), and if it returns an -ENOSPC error, the log
    sync code does not abort the transaction, instead it gracefully handles
    the error and returns -EAGAIN to the fsync handler, so that it falls back
    to a transaction commit. Any other error different from -ENOSPC, makes the
    log sync code abort the transaction.
    
    So remove the transaction abort from btrfs_update_log() when we fail to
    COW a path to update the root item, so that if an -ENOSPC failure happens
    we avoid aborting the current transaction and have a chance of the fsync
    succeeding after falling back to a transaction commit.

    libnvdimm/namespace: Fix label tracking error
    
    commit c4703ce11c23423d4b46e3d59aef7979814fd608 upstream.
    
    Users have reported intermittent occurrences of DIMM initialization
    failures due to duplicate allocations of address capacity detected in
    the labels, or errors of the form below, both have the same root cause.
    
        nd namespace1.4: failed to track label: 0
        WARNING: CPU: 17 PID: 1381 at drivers/nvdimm/label.c:863

         do_syscall_64+0x60/0x210
    
    Unfortunately those reports were typically with a busy parallel
    namespace creation / destruction loop making it difficult to see the
    components of the bug. However, Jane provided a simple reproducer using
    the work-in-progress sub-section implementation.
    
    When ndctl is reconfiguring a namespace it may take an existing defunct
    / disabled namespace and reconfigure it with a new uuid and other
    parameters. Critically namespace_update_uuid() takes existing address
    resources and renames them for the new namespace to use / reconfigure as
    it sees fit. The bug is that this rename only happens in the resource
    tracking tree. Existing labels with the old uuid are not reaped leading
    to a scenario where multiple active labels reference the same span of
    address range.
    
    Teach namespace_update_uuid() to flag any references to the old uuid for
    reaping at the next label update attempt.

    libnvdimm/pmem: Bypass CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY overhead
    
    commit 52f476a323f9efc959be1c890d0cdcf12e1582e0 upstream.
    
    Jeff discovered that performance improves from ~375K iops to ~519K iops
    on a simple psync-write fio workload when moving the location of 'struct
    page' from the default PMEM location to DRAM. This result is surprising
    because the expectation is that 'struct page' for dax is only needed for
    third party references to dax mappings. For example, a dax-mapped buffer
    passed to another system call for direct-I/O requires 'struct page' for
    sending the request down the driver stack and pinning the page. There is
    no usage of 'struct page' for first party access to a file via
    read(2)/write(2) and friends.
    
    However, this "no page needed" expectation is violated by
    CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY and the check_copy_size() performed in
    copy_from_iter_full_nocache() and copy_to_iter_mcsafe(). The
    check_heap_object() helper routine assumes the buffer is backed by a
    slab allocator (DRAM) page and applies some checks.  Those checks are
    invalid, dax pages do not originate from the slab, and redundant,
    dax_iomap_actor() has already validated that the I/O is within bounds.
    Specifically that routine validates that the logical file offset is
    within bounds of the file, then it does a sector-to-pfn translation
    which validates that the physical mapping is within bounds of the block
    device.
    
    Bypass additional hardened usercopy overhead and call the 'no check'
    versions of the copy_{to,from}_iter operations directly.

    commit c9bcd3e3335d0a29d89fabd2c385e1b989e6f1b0 upstream.
    
    Current logic does not allow VCPU to be loaded onto CPU with
    APIC ID 255. This should be allowed since the host physical APIC ID
    field in the AVIC Physical APIC table entry is an 8-bit value,
    and APIC ID 255 is valid in system with x2APIC enabled.
    Instead, do not allow VCPU load if the host APIC ID cannot be
    represented by an 8-bit value.
    
    Also, use the more appropriate AVIC_PHYSICAL_ID_ENTRY_HOST_PHYSICAL_ID_MASK
    instead of AVIC_MAX_PHYSICAL_ID_COUNT.

    The iproc host eMMC/SD controller hold time does not meet the

    Stable tag (v4.12+) chosen to assist stable kernel maintainers so that
    the change does not produce merge conflicts backporting to older kernel
    versions. In reality, the timing bug existed since the driver was first
    introduced but there is no need for this driver to be supported in kernel
    versions that old.

    crypto: vmx - CTR: always increment IV as quadword
    
    commit 009b30ac7444c17fae34c4f435ebce8e8e2b3250 upstream.
    
    The kernel self-tests picked up an issue with CTR mode:
    alg: skcipher: p8_aes_ctr encryption test failed (wrong result) on test vector 3, cfg="uneven misaligned splits, may sleep"
    
    Test vector 3 has an IV of FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFD, so
    after 3 increments it should wrap around to 0.
    
    In the aesp8-ppc code from OpenSSL, there are two paths that
    increment IVs: the bulk (8 at a time) path, and the individual
    path which is used when there are fewer than 8 AES blocks to
    process.
    
    In the bulk path, the IV is incremented with vadduqm: "Vector
    Add Unsigned Quadword Modulo", which does 128-bit addition.
    
    In the individual path, however, the IV is incremented with
    vadduwm: "Vector Add Unsigned Word Modulo", which instead
    does 4 32-bit additions. Thus the IV would instead become
    FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF00000000, throwing off the result.
    
    Use vadduqm.
    
    This was probably a typo originally, what with q and w being
    adjacent. It is a pretty narrow edge case: I am really
    impressed by the quality of the kernel self-tests!

    Revert "scsi: sd: Keep disk read-only when re-reading partition"
    
    commit 8acf608e602f6ec38b7cc37b04c80f1ce9a1a6cc upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 20bd1d026aacc5399464f8328f305985c493cde3.
    
    This patch introduced regressions for devices that come online in
    read-only state and subsequently switch to read-write.
    
    Given how the partition code is currently implemented it is not
    possible to persist the read-only flag across a device revalidate
    call. This may need to get addressed in the future since it is common
    for user applications to proactively call BLKRRPART.
    
    Reverting this commit will re-introduce a regression where a
    device-initiated revalidate event will cause the admin state to be
    forgotten. A separate patch will address this issue.

    sbitmap: fix improper use of smp_mb__before_atomic()
    
    commit a0934fd2b1208458e55fc4b48f55889809fce666 upstream.
    
    This barrier only applies to the read-modify-write operations; in
    particular, it does not apply to the atomic_set() primitive.
    
    Replace the barrier with an smp_mb().

    KVM: x86: fix return value for reserved EFER
    
    commit 66f61c92889ff3ca365161fb29dd36d6354682ba upstream.
    
    Commit 11988499e62b ("KVM: x86: Skip EFER vs. guest CPUID checks for
    host-initiated writes", 2019-04-02) introduced a "return false" in a
    function returning int, and anyway set_efer has a "nonzero on error"
    conventon so it should be returning 1.

    f2fs: Fix use of number of devices
    
    commit 0916878da355650d7e77104a7ac0fa1784eca852 upstream.
    
    For a single device mount using a zoned block device, the zone
    information for the device is stored in the sbi->devs single entry
    array and sbi->s_ndevs is set to 1. This differs from a single device
    mount using a regular block device which does not allocate sbi->devs
    and sets sbi->s_ndevs to 0.
    
    However, sbi->s_devs == 0 condition is used throughout the code to
    differentiate a single device mount from a multi-device mount where
    sbi->s_ndevs is always larger than 1. This results in problems with
    single zoned block device volumes as these are treated as multi-device
    mounts but do not have the start_blk and end_blk information set. One
    of the problem observed is skipping of zone discard issuing resulting in
    write commands being issued to full zones or unaligned to a zone write
    pointer.
    
    Fix this problem by simply treating the cases sbi->s_ndevs == 0 (single
    regular block device mount) and sbi->s_ndevs == 1 (single zoned block
    device mount) in the same manner. This is done by introducing the
    helper function f2fs_is_multi_device() and using this helper in place
    of direct tests of sbi->s_ndevs value, improving code readability.

    ext4: do not delete unlinked inode from orphan list on failed truncate
    
    commit ee0ed02ca93ef1ecf8963ad96638795d55af2c14 upstream.
    
    It is possible that unlinked inode enters ext4_setattr() (e.g. if
    somebody calls ftruncate(2) on unlinked but still open file). In such
    case we should not delete the inode from the orphan list if truncate
    fails. Note that this is mostly a theoretical concern as filesystem is
    corrupted if we reach this path anyway but let's be consistent in our
    orphan handling.

    x86: Hide the int3_emulate_call/jmp functions from UML
    
    commit 693713cbdb3a4bda5a8a678c31f06560bbb14657 upstream.
    
    User Mode Linux does not have access to the ip or sp fields of the pt_regs,
    and accessing them causes UML to fail to build. Hide the int3_emulate_jmp()
    and int3_emulate_call() instructions from UML, as it doesn't need them
    anyway.
