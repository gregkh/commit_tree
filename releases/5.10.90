    bpf: Add kconfig knob for disabling unpriv bpf by default
    
    commit 08389d888287c3823f80b0216766b71e17f0aba5 upstream.
    
    Add a kconfig knob which allows for unprivileged bpf to be disabled by default.
    If set, the knob sets /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled to value of 2.
    
    This still allows a transition of 2 -> {0,1} through an admin. Similarly,
    this also still keeps 1 -> {1} behavior intact, so that once set to permanently
    disabled, it cannot be undone aside from a reboot.
    
    We've also added extra2 with max of 2 for the procfs handler, so that an admin
    still has a chance to toggle between 0 <-> 2.
    
    Either way, as an additional alternative, applications can make use of CAP_BPF
    that we added a while ago.

    net: fix use-after-free in tw_timer_handler
    
    commit e22e45fc9e41bf9fcc1e92cfb78eb92786728ef0 upstream.
    
    A real world panic issue was found as follow in Linux 5.4.

    This issue was also reported since 2017 in the thread [1],
    unfortunately, the issue was still can be reproduced after fixing
    DCCP.
    
    The ipv4_mib_exit_net is called before tcp_sk_exit_batch when a net
    namespace is destroyed since tcp_sk_ops is registered befrore
    ipv4_mib_ops, which means tcp_sk_ops is in the front of ipv4_mib_ops
    in the list of pernet_list. There will be a use-after-free on
    net->mib.net_statistics in tw_timer_handler after ipv4_mib_exit_net
    if there are some inflight time-wait timers.
    
    This bug is not introduced by commit f2bf415cfed7 ("mib: add net to
    NET_ADD_STATS_BH") since the net_statistics is a global variable
    instead of dynamic allocation and freeing. Actually, commit
    61a7e26028b9 ("mib: put net statistics on struct net") introduces
    the bug since it put net statistics on struct net and free it when
    net namespace is destroyed.
    
    Moving init_ipv4_mibs() to the front of tcp_init() to fix this bug
    and replace pr_crit() with panic() since continuing is meaningless
    when init_ipv4_mibs() fails.

    Input: spaceball - fix parsing of movement data packets
    
    commit bc7ec91718c49d938849697cfad98fcd9877cc26 upstream.
    
    The spaceball.c module was not properly parsing the movement reports
    coming from the device.  The code read axis data as signed 16-bit
    little-endian values starting at offset 2.
    
    In fact, axis data in Spaceball movement reports are signed 16-bit
    big-endian values starting at offset 3.  This was determined first by
    visually inspecting the data packets, and later verified by consulting:

    Input: appletouch - initialize work before device registration
    
    commit 9f3ccdc3f6ef10084ceb3a47df0961bec6196fd0 upstream.
    
    Syzbot has reported warning in __flush_work(). This warning is caused by
    work->func == NULL, which means missing work initialization.
    
    This may happen, since input_dev->close() calls
    cancel_work_sync(&dev->work), but dev->work initalization happens _after_
    input_register_device() call.
    
    So this patch moves dev->work initialization before registering input
    device

    scsi: vmw_pvscsi: Set residual data length conditionally
    
    commit 142c779d05d1fef75134c3cb63f52ccbc96d9e1f upstream.
    
    The PVSCSI implementation in the VMware hypervisor under specific
    configuration ("SCSI Bus Sharing" set to "Physical") returns zero dataLen
    in the completion descriptor for READ CAPACITY(16). As a result, the kernel
    can not detect proper disk geometry. This can be recognized by the kernel
    message:
    
      [ 0.776588] sd 1:0:0:0: [sdb] Sector size 0 reported, assuming 512.
    
    The PVSCSI implementation in QEMU does not set dataLen at all, keeping it
    zeroed. This leads to a boot hang as was reported by Shmulik Ladkani.
    
    It is likely that the controller returns the garbage at the end of the
    buffer. Residual length should be set by the driver in that case. The SCSI
    layer will erase corresponding data. See commit bdb2b8cab439 ("[SCSI] erase
    invalid data returned by device") for details.
    
    Commit e662502b3a78 ("scsi: vmw_pvscsi: Set correct residual data length")
    introduced the issue by setting residual length unconditionally, causing
    the SCSI layer to erase the useful payload beyond dataLen when this value
    is returned as 0.
    
    As a result, considering existing issues in implementations of PVSCSI
    controllers, we do not want to call scsi_set_resid() when dataLen ==
    0. Calling scsi_set_resid() has no effect if dataLen equals buffer length.

    binder: fix async_free_space accounting for empty parcels
    
    commit cfd0d84ba28c18b531648c9d4a35ecca89ad9901 upstream.
    
    In 4.13, commit 74310e06be4d ("android: binder: Move buffer out of area shared with user space")
    fixed a kernel structure visibility issue. As part of that patch,
    sizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length data payloads so
    the driver could detect abusive clients sending 0-length asynchronous
    transactions to a server by enforcing limits on async_free_size.
    
    Unfortunately, on the "free" side, the accounting of async_free_space
    did not add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was that up to 8-bytes of
    async_free_space were leaked on every async transaction of 8-bytes or
    less.  These small transactions are uncommon, so this accounting issue
    has gone undetected for several years.
    
    The fix is to use "buffer_size" (the allocated buffer size) instead of
    "size" (the logical buffer size) when updating the async_free_space
    during the free operation. These are the same except for this
    corner case of asynchronous transactions with payloads < 8 bytes.

    usb: gadget: f_fs: Clear ffs_eventfd in ffs_data_clear.
    
    commit b1e0887379422975f237d43d8839b751a6bcf154 upstream.
    
    ffs_data_clear is indirectly called from both ffs_fs_kill_sb and
    ffs_ep0_release, so it ends up being called twice when userland closes ep0
    and then unmounts f_fs.
    If userland provided an eventfd along with function's USB descriptors, it
    ends up calling eventfd_ctx_put as many times, causing a refcount
    underflow.
    NULL-ify ffs_eventfd to prevent these extraneous eventfd_ctx_put calls.
    
    Also, set epfiles to NULL right after de-allocating it, for readability.
    
    For completeness, ffs_data_clear actually ends up being called thrice, the
    last call being before the whole ffs structure gets freed, so when this
    specific sequence happens there is a second underflow happening (but not
    being reported):

    xhci: Fresco FL1100 controller should not have BROKEN_MSI quirk set.
    
    commit e4844092581ceec22489b66c42edc88bc6079783 upstream.
    
    The Fresco Logic FL1100 controller needs the TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk like
    other Fresco controllers, but should not have the BROKEN_MSI quirks set.
    
    BROKEN_MSI quirk causes issues in detecting usb drives connected to docks
    with this FL1100 controller.
    The BROKEN_MSI flag was apparently accidentally set together with the
    TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk
    
    Original patch went to stable so this should go there as well.

    drm/amdgpu: When the VCN(1.0) block is suspended, powergating is explicitly enabled
    
    commit b7865173cf6ae59942e2c69326a06e1c1df5ecf6 upstream.
    
    Play a video on the raven (or PCO, raven2) platform, and then do the S3
    test. When resume, the following error will be reported:
    
    amdgpu 0000:02:00.0: [drm:amdgpu_ring_test_helper [amdgpu]] *ERROR* ring
    vcn_dec test failed (-110)
    [drm:amdgpu_device_ip_resume_phase2 [amdgpu]] *ERROR* resume of IP block
    <vcn_v1_0> failed -110
    amdgpu 0000:02:00.0: amdgpu: amdgpu_device_ip_resume failed (-110).
    PM: dpm_run_callback(): pci_pm_resume+0x0/0x90 returns -110
    
    [why]
    When playing the video: The power state flag of the vcn block is set to
    POWER_STATE_ON.
    
    When doing suspend: There is no change to the power state flag of the
    vcn block, it is still POWER_STATE_ON.
    
    When doing resume: Need to open the power gate of the vcn block and set
    the power state flag of the VCN block to POWER_STATE_ON.
    But at this time, the power state flag of the vcn block is already
    POWER_STATE_ON. The power status flag check in the "8f2cdef drm/amd/pm:
    avoid duplicate powergate/ungate setting" patch will return the
    amdgpu_dpm_set_powergating_by_smu function directly.
    As a result, the gate of the power was not opened, causing the
    subsequent ring test to fail.
    
    [how]
    In the suspend function of the vcn block, explicitly change the power
    state flag of the vcn block to POWER_STATE_OFF.

    As we can see from the comment of the nla_put() that it could return
    -EMSGSIZE if the tailroom of the skb is insufficient.

    net/mlx5e: Fix wrong features assignment in case of error
    
    [ Upstream commit 992d8a4e38f0527f24e273ce3a9cd6dea1a6a436 ]
    
    In case of an error in mlx5e_set_features(), 'netdev->features' must be
    updated with the correct state of the device to indicate which features
    were updated successfully.
    To do that we maintain a copy of 'netdev->features' and update it after
    successful feature changes, so we can assign it to back to
    'netdev->features' if needed.
    
    However, since not all netdev features are handled by the driver (e.g.
    GRO/TSO/etc), some features may not be updated correctly in case of an
    error updating another feature.
    
    For example, while requesting to disable TSO (feature which is not
    handled by the driver) and enable HW-GRO, if an error occurs during
    HW-GRO enable, 'oper_features' will be assigned with 'netdev->features'
    and HW-GRO turned off. TSO will remain enabled in such case, which is a
    bug.
    
    To solve that, instead of using 'netdev->features' as the baseline of
    'oper_features' and changing it on set feature success, use 'features'
    instead and update it in case of errors.

    To make sure we won't receive any CDC messages after we free the
    smc_sock, add a refcount on the smc_connection for inflight CDC
    message(posted to the QP but haven't received related CQE), and
    don't release the smc_connection until all the inflight CDC messages
    haven been done, for both success or failed ones.
    
    Using refcount on CDC messages brings another problem: when the link
    is going to be destroyed, smcr_link_clear() will reset the QP, which
    then remove all the pending CQEs related to the QP in the CQ. To make
    sure all the CQEs will always come back so the refcount on the
    smc_connection can always reach 0, smc_ib_modify_qp_reset() was replaced
    by smc_ib_modify_qp_error().
    And remove the timeout in smc_wr_tx_wait_no_pending_sends() since we
    need to wait for all pending WQEs done, or we may encounter use-after-
    free when handling CQEs.
    
    For IB device removal routine, we need to wait for all the QPs on that
    device been destroyed before we can destroy CQs on the device, or
    the refcount on smc_connection won't reach 0 and smc_sock cannot be
    released.

    net/smc: don't send CDC/LLC message if link not ready
    
    [ Upstream commit 90cee52f2e780345d3629e278291aea5ac74f40f ]
    
    We found smc_llc_send_link_delete_all() sometimes wait
    for 2s timeout when testing with RDMA link up/down.
    It is possible when a smc_link is in ACTIVATING state,
    the underlaying QP is still in RESET or RTR state, which
    cannot send any messages out.
    
    smc_llc_send_link_delete_all() use smc_link_usable() to
    checks whether the link is usable, if the QP is still in
    RESET or RTR state, but the smc_link is in ACTIVATING, this
    LLC message will always fail without any CQE entering the
    CQ, and we will always wait 2s before timeout.
    
    Since we cannot send any messages through the QP before
    the QP enter RTS. I add a wrapper smc_link_sendable()
    which checks the state of QP along with the link state.
    And replace smc_link_usable() with smc_link_sendable()
    in all LLC & CDC message sending routine.

    net: usb: pegasus: Do not drop long Ethernet frames
    
    [ Upstream commit ca506fca461b260ab32952b610c3d4aadc6c11fd ]
    
    The D-Link DSB-650TX (2001:4002) is unable to receive Ethernet frames
    that are longer than 1518 octets, for example, Ethernet frames that
    contain 802.1Q VLAN tags.
    
    The frames are sent to the pegasus driver via USB but the driver
    discards them because they have the Long_pkt field set to 1 in the
    received status report. The function read_bulk_callback of the pegasus
    driver treats such received "packets" (in the terminology of the
    hardware) as errors but the field simply does just indicate that the
    Ethernet frame (MAC destination to FCS) is longer than 1518 octets.
    
    It seems that in the 1990s there was a distinction between
    "giant" (> 1518) and "runt" (< 64) frames and the hardware includes
    flags to indicate this distinction. It seems that the purpose of the
    distinction "giant" frames was to not allow infinitely long frames due
    to transmission errors and to allow hardware to have an upper limit of
    the frame size. However, the hardware already has such limit with its
    2048 octet receive buffer and, therefore, Long_pkt is merely a
    convention and should not be treated as a receive error.
    
    Actually, the hardware is even able to receive Ethernet frames with 2048
    octets which exceeds the claimed limit frame size limit of the driver of
    1536 octets (PEGASUS_MTU).

    This issue occurs when asoc is peeled off and the old sk is freed after
    getting it by asoc->base.sk and before calling lock_sock(sk).
    
    To prevent the sk free, as a holder of the sk, ep should be alive when
    calling lock_sock(). This patch uses call_rcu() and moves sock_put and
    ep free into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), so that it's safe to try to
    hold the ep under rcu_read_lock in sctp_transport_traverse_process().
    
    If sctp_endpoint_hold() returns true, it means this ep is still alive
    and we have held it and can continue to dump it; If it returns false,
    it means this ep is dead and can be freed after rcu_read_unlock, and
    we should skip it.
    
    In sctp_sock_dump(), after locking the sk, if this ep is different from
    tsp->asoc->ep, it means during this dumping, this asoc was peeled off
    before calling lock_sock(), and the sk should be skipped; If this ep is
    the same with tsp->asoc->ep, it means no peeloff happens on this asoc,
    and due to lock_sock, no peeloff will happen either until release_sock.
    
    Note that delaying endpoint free won't delay the port release, as the
    port release happens in sctp_endpoint_destroy() before calling call_rcu().
    Also, freeing endpoint by call_rcu() makes it safe to access the sk by
    asoc->base.sk in sctp_assocs_seq_show() and sctp_rcv().
    
    Thanks Jones to bring this issue up.
    
    v1->v2:
      - improve the changelog.
      - add kfree(ep) into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), as Jakub noticed.

    net/mlx5e: Fix ICOSQ recovery flow for XSK
    
    [ Upstream commit 19c4aba2d4e23997061fb11aed8a3e41334bfa14 ]
    
    There are two ICOSQs per channel: one is needed for RX, and the other
    for async operations (XSK TX, kTLS offload). Currently, the recovery
    flow for both is the same, and async ICOSQ is mistakenly treated like
    the regular ICOSQ.
    
    This patch prevents running the regular ICOSQ recovery on async ICOSQ.
    The purpose of async ICOSQ is to handle XSK wakeup requests and post
    kTLS offload RX parameters, it has nothing to do with RQ and XSKRQ UMRs,
    so the regular recovery sequence is not applicable here.

    selinux_parse_skb() can return ok without setting proto.  The later call
    to selinux_xfrm_postroute_last() does an early check of proto and can

    recordmcount.pl: fix typo in s390 mcount regex
    
    commit 4eb1782eaa9fa1c224ad1fa0d13a9f09c3ab2d80 upstream.
    
    Commit 85bf17b28f97 ("recordmcount.pl: look for jgnop instruction as well
    as bcrl on s390") added a new alternative mnemonic for the existing brcl
    instruction. This is required for the combination old gcc version (pre 9.0)
    and binutils since version 2.37.
    However at the same time this commit introduced a typo, replacing brcl with
    bcrl. As a result no mcount locations are detected anymore with old gcc
    versions (pre 9.0) and binutils before version 2.37.
    Fix this by using the correct mnemonic again.

    parisc: Clear stale IIR value on instruction access rights trap
    
    [ Upstream commit 484730e5862f6b872dca13840bed40fd7c60fa26 ]
    
    When a trap 7 (Instruction access rights) occurs, this means the CPU
    couldn't execute an instruction due to missing execute permissions on
    the memory region.  In this case it seems the CPU didn't even fetched
    the instruction from memory and thus did not store it in the cr19 (IIR)
    register before calling the trap handler. So, the trap handler will find
    some random old stale value in cr19.
    
    This patch simply overwrites the stale IIR value with a constant magic
    "bad food" value (0xbaadf00d), in the hope people don't start to try to
    understand the various random IIR values in trap 7 dumps.

    tomoyo: Check exceeded quota early in tomoyo_domain_quota_is_ok().
    
    [ Upstream commit 04e57a2d952bbd34bc45744e72be3eecdc344294 ]
    
    If tomoyo is used in a testing/fuzzing environment in learning mode,
    for lots of domains the quota will be exceeded and stay exceeded
    for prolonged periods of time. In such cases it's pointless (and slow)
    to walk the whole acl list again and again just to rediscover that
    the quota is exceeded. We already have the TOMOYO_DIF_QUOTA_WARNED flag
    that notes the overflow condition. Check it early to avoid the slowdown.
    
    [penguin-kernel]
    This patch causes a user visible change that the learning mode will not be
    automatically resumed after the quota is increased. To resume the learning
    mode, administrator will need to explicitly clear TOMOYO_DIF_QUOTA_WARNED
    flag after increasing the quota. But I think that this change is generally
    preferable, for administrator likely wants to optimize the acl list for
    that domain before increasing the quota, or that domain likely hits the
    quota again. Therefore, don't try to care to clear TOMOYO_DIF_QUOTA_WARNED
    flag automatically when the quota for that domain changed.

    The ASUS UM325UA suffers from the same issue as the ASUS UX425UA, which
    is a very similar laptop. The i8042 device is not usable immediately
    after boot and fails to initialize, requiring a deferred retry.
    
    Enable the deferred probe quirk for the UM325UA.

    Input: i8042 - add deferred probe support
    
    [ Upstream commit 9222ba68c3f4065f6364b99cc641b6b019ef2d42 ]
    
    We've got a bug report about the non-working keyboard on ASUS ZenBook
    UX425UA.  It seems that the PS/2 device isn't ready immediately at
    boot but takes some seconds to get ready.  Until now, the only
    workaround is to defer the probe, but it's available only when the
    driver is a module.  However, many distros, including openSUSE as in
    the original report, build the PS/2 input drivers into kernel, hence
    it won't work easily.
    
    This patch adds the support for the deferred probe for i8042 stuff as
    a workaround of the problem above.  When the deferred probe mode is
    enabled and the device couldn't be probed, it'll be repeated with the
    standard deferred probe mechanism.
    
    The deferred probe mode is enabled either via the new option
    i8042.probe_defer or via the quirk table entry.  As of this patch, the
    quirk table contains only ASUS ZenBook UX425UA.
    
    The deferred probe part is based on Fabio's initial work.
