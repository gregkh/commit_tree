    Revert "drm/vc4: hdmi: Make sure the device is powered with CEC" again
    
    This reverts commit 55b10b88ac8654fc2f31518aa349a2e643b37f18 which is
    commit 20b0dfa86bef0e80b41b0e5ac38b92f23b6f27f9 upstream.
    
    It wasn't applied correctly, something went wrong with an attempt to fix
    it up again, so just revert the whole thing to be back at a clean state.
