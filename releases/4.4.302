    Input: i8042 - Fix misplaced backport of "add ASUS Zenbook Flip to noselftest list"
    
    The upstream commit b5d6e7ab7fe7 ("Input: i8042 - add ASUS Zenbook Flip to
    noselftest list") inserted a new entry in the `i8042_dmi_noselftest_table`
    table, further patched by commit daa58c8eec0a ("Input: i8042 - fix Pegatron
    C15B ID entry") to insert a missing separator.
    
    However, their backported version in stable (commit e480ccf433be
    ("Input: i8042 - add ASUS Zenbook Flip to noselftest list") and
    commit 7444a4152ac3 ("Input: i8042 - fix Pegatron C15B ID entry"))
    inserted this entry in `i8042_dmi_forcemux_table` instead.
    
    This patch moves the entry back into `i8042_dmi_noselftest_table`.

    ipv4: tcp: send zero IPID in SYNACK messages
    
    [ Upstream commit 970a5a3ea86da637471d3cd04d513a0755aba4bf ]
    
    In commit 431280eebed9 ("ipv4: tcp: send zero IPID for RST and
    ACK sent in SYN-RECV and TIME-WAIT state") we took care of some
    ctl packets sent by TCP.
    
    It turns out we need to use a similar strategy for SYNACK packets.
    
    By default, they carry IP_DF and IPID==0, but there are ways
    to ask them to use the hashed IP ident generator and thus
    be used to build off-path attacks.
    (Ref: Off-Path TCP Exploits of the Mixed IPID Assignment)
    
    One of this way is to force (before listener is started)
    echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc
    
    Another way is using forged ICMP ICMP_FRAG_NEEDED
    with a very small MTU (like 68) to force a false return from
    ip_dont_fragment()
    
    In this patch, ip_build_and_send_pkt() uses the following
    heuristics.
    
    1) Most SYNACK packets are smaller than IPV4_MIN_MTU and therefore
    can use IP_DF regardless of the listener or route pmtu setting.
    
    2) In case the SYNACK packet is bigger than IPV4_MIN_MTU,
    we use prandom_u32() generator instead of the IPv4 hashed ident one.

    hwmon: (lm90) Reduce maximum conversion rate for G781
    
    [ Upstream commit a66c5ed539277b9f2363bbace0dba88b85b36c26 ]
    
    According to its datasheet, G781 supports a maximum conversion rate value
    of 8 (62.5 ms). However, chips labeled G781 and G780 were found to only
    support a maximum conversion rate value of 7 (125 ms). On the other side,
    chips labeled G781-1 and G784 were found to support a conversion rate value
    of 8. There is no known means to distinguish G780 from G781 or G784; all
    chips report the same manufacturer ID and chip revision.
    Setting the conversion rate register value to 8 on chips not supporting
    it causes unexpected behavior since the real conversion rate is set to 0
    (16 seconds) if a value of 8 is written into the conversion rate register.
    Limit the conversion rate register value to 7 for all G78x chips to avoid
    the problem.

    ipv4: avoid using shared IP generator for connected sockets
    
    commit 23f57406b82de51809d5812afd96f210f8b627f3 upstream.
    
    ip_select_ident_segs() has been very conservative about using
    the connected socket private generator only for packets with IP_DF
    set, claiming it was needed for some VJ compression implementations.
    
    As mentioned in this referenced document, this can be abused.
    (Ref: Off-Path TCP Exploits of the Mixed IPID Assignment)
    
    Before switching to pure random IPID generation and possibly hurt
    some workloads, lets use the private inet socket generator.
    
    Not only this will remove one vulnerability, this will also
    improve performance of TCP flows using pmtudisc==IP_PMTUDISC_DONT

    net: fix information leakage in /proc/net/ptype
    
    commit 47934e06b65637c88a762d9c98329ae6e3238888 upstream.
    
    In one net namespace, after creating a packet socket without binding
    it to a device, users in other net namespaces can observe the new
    `packet_type` added by this packet socket by reading `/proc/net/ptype`
    file. This is minor information leakage as packet socket is
    namespace aware.
    
    Add a net pointer in `packet_type` to keep the net namespace of
    of corresponding packet socket. In `ptype_seq_show`, this net pointer
    must be checked when it is not NULL.

    scsi: bnx2fc: Flush destroy_work queue before calling bnx2fc_interface_put()
    
    commit 847f9ea4c5186fdb7b84297e3eeed9e340e83fce upstream.
    
    The bnx2fc_destroy() functions are removing the interface before calling

    the controller rport device attributes are removed too early.

    USB: core: Fix hang in usb_kill_urb by adding memory barriers
    
    commit 26fbe9772b8c459687930511444ce443011f86bf upstream.
    
    The syzbot fuzzer has identified a bug in which processes hang waiting
    for usb_kill_urb() to return.  It turns out the issue is not unlinking
    the URB; that works just fine.  Rather, the problem arises when the
    wakeup notification that the URB has completed is not received.
    
    The reason is memory-access ordering on SMP systems.  In outline form,
    usb_kill_urb() and __usb_hcd_giveback_urb() operating concurrently on
    different CPUs perform the following actions:
    
    CPU 0                                   CPU 1
    ----------------------------            ---------------------------------
    usb_kill_urb():                         __usb_hcd_giveback_urb():
      ...                                     ...
      atomic_inc(&urb->reject);               atomic_dec(&urb->use_count);
      ...                                     ...
      wait_event(usb_kill_urb_queue,
            atomic_read(&urb->use_count) == 0);
                                              if (atomic_read(&urb->reject))
                                                    wake_up(&usb_kill_urb_queue);
    
    Confining your attention to urb->reject and urb->use_count, you can
    see that the overall pattern of accesses on CPU 0 is:
    
            write urb->reject, then read urb->use_count;
    
    whereas the overall pattern of accesses on CPU 1 is:
    
            write urb->use_count, then read urb->reject.
    
    This pattern is referred to in memory-model circles as SB (for "Store
    Buffering"), and it is well known that without suitable enforcement of
    the desired order of accesses -- in the form of memory barriers -- it
    is entirely possible for one or both CPUs to execute their reads ahead
    of their writes.  The end result will be that sometimes CPU 0 sees the
    old un-decremented value of urb->use_count while CPU 1 sees the old
    un-incremented value of urb->reject.  Consequently CPU 0 ends up on
    the wait queue and never gets woken up, leading to the observed hang
    in usb_kill_urb().
    
    The same pattern of accesses occurs in usb_poison_urb() and the
    failure pathway of usb_hcd_submit_urb().
    
    The problem is fixed by adding suitable memory barriers.  To provide
    proper memory-access ordering in the SB pattern, a full barrier is
    required on both CPUs.  The atomic_inc() and atomic_dec() accesses
    themselves don't provide any memory ordering, but since they are
    present, we can use the optimized smp_mb__after_atomic() memory
    barrier in the various routines to obtain the desired effect.
    
    This patch adds the necessary memory barriers.

    usb-storage: Add unusual-devs entry for VL817 USB-SATA bridge
    
    commit 5b67b315037250a61861119683e7fcb509deea25 upstream.
    
    Two people have reported (and mentioned numerous other reports on the
    web) that VIA's VL817 USB-SATA bridge does not work with the uas
    driver.  Typical log messages are:
    
    [ 3606.232149] sd 14:0:0:0: [sdg] tag#2 uas_zap_pending 0 uas-tag 1 inflight: CMD
    [ 3606.232154] sd 14:0:0:0: [sdg] tag#2 CDB: Write(16) 8a 00 00 00 00 00 18 0c c9 80 00 00 00 80 00 00

    [ 3606.328584] scsi host14: uas_eh_device_reset_handler success
    
    Surprisingly, the devices do seem to work okay for some other people.
    The cause of the differing behaviors is not known.
    
    In the hope of getting the devices to work for the most users, even at
    the possible cost of degraded performance for some, this patch adds an
    unusual_devs entry for the VL817 to block it from binding to the uas
    driver by default.  Users will be able to override this entry by means
    of a module parameter, if they want.

    tty: n_gsm: fix SW flow control encoding/handling
    
    commit 8838b2af23caf1ff0610caef2795d6668a013b2d upstream.
    
    n_gsm is based on the 3GPP 07.010 and its newer version is the 3GPP 27.010.
    See https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=1516
    The changes from 07.010 to 27.010 are non-functional. Therefore, I refer to
    the newer 27.010 here. Chapter 5.2.7.3 states that DC1 (XON) and DC3 (XOFF)
    are the control characters defined in ISO/IEC 646. These shall be quoted if
    seen in the data stream to avoid interpretation as flow control characters.
    
    ISO/IEC 646 refers to the set of ISO standards described as the ISO
    7-bit coded character set for information interchange. Its final version
    is also known as ITU T.50.
    See https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.50-199209-I/en
    
    To abide the standard it is needed to quote DC1 and DC3 correctly if these
    are seen as data bytes and not as control characters. The current
    implementation already tries to enforce this but fails to catch all
    defined cases. 3GPP 27.010 chapter 5.2.7.3 clearly states that the most
    significant bit shall be ignored for DC1 and DC3 handling. The current
    implementation handles only the case with the most significant bit set 0.
    Cases in which DC1 and DC3 have the most significant bit set 1 are left
    unhandled.
    
    This patch fixes this by masking the data bytes with ISO_IEC_646_MASK (only
    the 7 least significant bits set 1) before comparing them with XON
    (a.k.a. DC1) and XOFF (a.k.a. DC3) when testing which byte values need
    quotation via byte stuffing.

    The buffer handling in pm_show_wakelocks() is tricky, and hopefully
    correct.  Ensure it really is correct by using sysfs_emit_at() which
    handles all of the tricky string handling logic in a PAGE_SIZE buffer
    for us automatically as this is a sysfs file being read from.

    udf: Fix NULL ptr deref when converting from inline format
    
    commit 7fc3b7c2981bbd1047916ade327beccb90994eee upstream.
    
    udf_expand_file_adinicb() calls directly ->writepage to write data
    expanded into a page. This however misses to setup inode for writeback
    properly and so we can crash on inode->i_wb dereference when submitting
    page for IO like:
    
      BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000158
      #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode
    ...

    Fix the problem by marking the page dirty and going through the standard
    writeback path to write the page. Strictly speaking we would not even
    have to write the page but we want to catch e.g. ENOSPC errors early.

    scsi: zfcp: Fix failed recovery on gone remote port with non-NPIV FCP devices
    
    commit 8c9db6679be4348b8aae108e11d4be2f83976e30 upstream.
    
    Suppose we have an environment with a number of non-NPIV FCP devices
    (virtual HBAs / FCP devices / zfcp "adapter"s) sharing the same physical
    FCP channel (HBA port) and its I_T nexus. Plus a number of storage target
    ports zoned to such shared channel. Now one target port logs out of the
    fabric causing an RSCN. Zfcp reacts with an ADISC ELS and subsequent port
    recovery depending on the ADISC result. This happens on all such FCP
    devices (in different Linux images) concurrently as they all receive a copy
    of this RSCN. In the following we look at one of those FCP devices.
    
    Requests other than FSF_QTCB_FCP_CMND can be slow until they get a
    response.
    
    Depending on which requests are affected by slow responses, there are
    different recovery outcomes. Here we want to fix failed recoveries on port
    or adapter level by avoiding recovery requests that can be slow.
    
    We need the cached N_Port_ID for the remote port "link" test with ADISC.
    Just before sending the ADISC, we now intentionally forget the old cached
    N_Port_ID. The idea is that on receiving an RSCN for a port, we have to
    assume that any cached information about this port is stale.  This forces a
    fresh new GID_PN [FC-GS] nameserver lookup on any subsequent recovery for
    the same port. Since we typically can still communicate with the nameserver
    efficiently, we now reach steady state quicker: Either the nameserver still
    does not know about the port so we stop recovery, or the nameserver already
    knows the port potentially with a new N_Port_ID and we can successfully and
    quickly perform open port recovery.  For the one case, where ADISC returns
    successfully, we re-initialize port->d_id because that case does not
    involve any port recovery.
    
    This also solves a problem if the storage WWPN quickly logs into the fabric
    again but with a different N_Port_ID. Such as on virtual WWPN takeover
    during target NPIV failover.
    [https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp5477.html] In that case the
    RSCN from the storage FDISC was ignored by zfcp and we could not
    successfully recover the failover. On some later failback on the storage,
    we could have been lucky if the virtual WWPN got the same old N_Port_ID
    from the SAN switch as we still had cached.  Then the related RSCN
    triggered a successful port reopen recovery.  However, there is no
    guarantee to get the same N_Port_ID on NPIV FDISC.
    
    Even though NPIV-enabled FCP devices are not affected by this problem, this
    code change optimizes recovery time for gone remote ports as a side effect.
    The timely drop of cached N_Port_IDs prevents unnecessary slow open port
    attempts.
    
    While the problem might have been in code before v2.6.32 commit
    799b76d09aee ("[SCSI] zfcp: Decouple gid_pn requests from erp") this fix
    depends on the gid_pn_work introduced with that commit, so we mark it as
    culprit to satisfy fix dependencies.
    
    Note: Point-to-point remote port is already handled separately and gets its
    N_Port_ID from the cached peer_d_id. So resetting port->d_id in general
    does not affect PtP.

    s390/hypfs: include z/VM guests with access control group set
    
    commit 663d34c8df98740f1e90241e78e456d00b3c6cad upstream.
    
    Currently if z/VM guest is allowed to retrieve hypervisor performance
    data globally for all guests (privilege class B) the query is formed in a
    way to include all guests but the group name is left empty. This leads to
    that z/VM guests which have access control group set not being included
    in the results (even local vm).
    
    Change the query group identifier from empty to "any" to retrieve
    information about all guests from any groups (or without a group set).

    Bluetooth: refactor malicious adv data check
    
    commit 899663be5e75dc0174dc8bda0b5e6826edf0b29a upstream.
    
    Check for out-of-bound read was being performed at the end of while
    num_reports loop, and would fill journal with false positives. Added
    check to beginning of loop processing so that it doesn't get checked
    after ptr has been advanced.

    can: bcm: fix UAF of bcm op
    
    Stopping tasklet and hrtimer rely on the active state of tasklet and
    hrtimer sequentially in bcm_remove_op(), the op object will be freed
    if they are all unactive. Assume the hrtimer timeout is short, the
    hrtimer cb has been excuted after tasklet conditional judgment which
    must be false after last round tasklet_kill() and before condition
    hrtimer_active(), it is false when execute to hrtimer_active(). Bug
    is triggerd, because the stopping action is end and the op object
    will be freed, but the tasklet is scheduled. The resources of the op
    object will occur UAF bug.
    
    Move hrtimer_cancel() behind tasklet_kill() and switch 'while () {...}'
    to 'do {...} while ()' to fix the op UAF problem.
