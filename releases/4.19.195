    proc: only require mm_struct for writing
    
    commit 94f0b2d4a1d0c52035aef425da5e022bd2cb1c71 upstream.
    
    Commit 591a22c14d3f ("proc: Track /proc/$pid/attr/ opener mm_struct") we
    started using __mem_open() to track the mm_struct at open-time, so that
    we could then check it for writes.
    
    But that also ended up making the permission checks at open time much
    stricter - and not just for writes, but for reads too.  And that in turn
    caused a regression for at least Fedora 29, where NIC interfaces fail to
    start when using NetworkManager.
    
    Since only the write side wanted the mm_struct test, ignore any failures
    by __mem_open() at open time, leaving reads unaffected.  The write()
    time verification of the mm_struct pointer will then catch the failure
    case because a NULL pointer will not match a valid 'current->mm'.

    overflow introduced in 0fc1b09ff1ff, seems that this fix can't prevent
    overflow entirely, the length check should also take the sizeof
    entry->array[0] into account, since this array[0] is filled the
    length of trace data and occupy addtional space and risk overflow.

    ftrace: Do not blindly read the ip address in ftrace_bug()
    
    commit 6c14133d2d3f768e0a35128faac8aa6ed4815051 upstream.
    
    It was reported that a bug on arm64 caused a bad ip address to be used for
    updating into a nop in ftrace_init(), but the error path (rightfully)
    returned -EINVAL and not -EFAULT, as the bug caused more than one error to
    occur. But because -EINVAL was returned, the ftrace_bug() tried to report
    what was at the location of the ip address, and read it directly. This
    caused the machine to panic, as the ip was not pointing to a valid memory
    address.
    
    Instead, read the ip address with copy_from_kernel_nofault() to safely
    access the memory, and if it faults, report that the address faulted,
    otherwise report what was in that location.

    get_device(shost->shost_gendev.parent) is called after host state has

    parent device if host state is still SHOST_CREATED.

    scsi: core: Put .shost_dev in failure path if host state changes to RUNNING
    
    commit 11714026c02d613c30a149c3f4c4a15047744529 upstream.
    
    scsi_host_dev_release() only frees dev_name when host state is
    SHOST_CREATED. After host state has changed to SHOST_RUNNING,
    scsi_host_dev_release() no longer cleans up.
    
    Fix this by doing a put_device(&shost->shost_dev) in the failure path when
    host state is SHOST_RUNNING. Move get_device(&shost->shost_gendev) before
    device_add(&shost->shost_dev) so that scsi_host_cls_release() can do a put
    on this reference.

    scsi: core: Fix error handling of scsi_host_alloc()
    
    commit 66a834d092930cf41d809c0e989b13cd6f9ca006 upstream.
    
    After device is initialized via device_initialize(), or its name is set via
    dev_set_name(), the device has to be freed via put_device().  Otherwise
    device name will be leaked because it is allocated dynamically in
    dev_set_name().
    
    Fix the leak by replacing kfree() with put_device(). Since
    scsi_host_dev_release() properly handles IDA and kthread removal, remove
    special-casing these from the error handling as well.

    NFSv4: nfs4_proc_set_acl needs to restore NFS_CAP_UIDGID_NOMAP on error.
    
    commit f8849e206ef52b584cd9227255f4724f0cc900bb upstream.
    
    Currently if __nfs4_proc_set_acl fails with NFS4ERR_BADOWNER it
    re-enables the idmapper by clearing NFS_CAP_UIDGID_NOMAP before
    retrying again. The NFS_CAP_UIDGID_NOMAP remains cleared even if
    the retry fails. This causes problem for subsequent setattr
    requests for v4 server that does not have idmapping configured.
    
    This patch modifies nfs4_proc_set_acl to detect NFS4ERR_BADOWNER
    and NFS4ERR_BADNAME and skips the retry, since the kernel isn't
    involved in encoding the ACEs, and return -EINVAL.
    
    Steps to reproduce the problem:
    
     # mount -o vers=4.1,sec=sys server:/export/test /tmp/mnt
     # touch /tmp/mnt/file1
     # chown 99 /tmp/mnt/file1
     # nfs4_setfacl -a A::unknown.user@xyz.com:wrtncy /tmp/mnt/file1
     Failed setxattr operation: Invalid argument
     # chown 99 /tmp/mnt/file1
     chown: changing ownership of ‘/tmp/mnt/file1’: Invalid argument
     # umount /tmp/mnt
     # mount -o vers=4.1,sec=sys server:/export/test /tmp/mnt
     # chown 99 /tmp/mnt/file1

    commit 476bdb04c501fc64bf3b8464ffddefc8dbe01577 upstream.
    
    KASAN reports a use-after-free when attempting to mount two different

    Olga was able to hit this with kernels starting somewhere between 5.7
    and 5.10, but I traced the patch that introduced the clear_bit() call to
    4.13. So something must have changed in the refcounting of the clp
    pointer to make this call to nfs_put_client() the very last one.

    perf session: Correct buffer copying when peeking events
    
    [ Upstream commit 197eecb6ecae0b04bd694432f640ff75597fed9c ]
    
    When peeking an event, it has a short path and a long path.  The short
    path uses the session pointer "one_mmap_addr" to directly fetch the
    event; and the long path needs to read out the event header and the
    following event data from file and fill into the buffer pointer passed
    through the argument "buf".
    
    The issue is in the long path that it copies the event header and event
    data into the same destination address which pointer "buf", this means
    the event header is overwritten.  We are just lucky to run into the
    short path in most cases, so we don't hit the issue in the long path.
    
    This patch adds the offset "hdr_sz" to the pointer "buf" when copying
    the event data, so that it can reserve the event header which can be
    used properly by its caller.

    NFSv4: Fix deadlock between nfs4_evict_inode() and nfs4_opendata_get_inode()
    
    [ Upstream commit dfe1fe75e00e4c724ede7b9e593f6f680e446c5f ]
    
    If the inode is being evicted, but has to return a delegation first,
    then it can cause a deadlock in the corner case where the server reboots
    before the delegreturn completes, but while the call to iget5_locked() in
    nfs4_opendata_get_inode() is waiting for the inode free to complete.
    Since the open call still holds a session slot, the reboot recovery
    cannot proceed.
    
    In order to break the logjam, we can turn the delegation return into a
    privileged operation for the case where we're evicting the inode. We
    know that in that case, there can be no other state recovery operation
    that conflicts.

    IB/mlx5: Fix initializing CQ fragments buffer
    
    commit 2ba0aa2feebda680ecfc3c552e867cf4d1b05a3a upstream.
    
    The function init_cq_frag_buf() can be called to initialize the current CQ
    fragments buffer cq->buf, or the temporary cq->resize_buf that is filled
    during CQ resize operation.
    
    However, the offending commit started to use function get_cqe() for
    getting the CQEs, the issue with this change is that get_cqe() always
    returns CQEs from cq->buf, which leads us to initialize the wrong buffer,
    and in case of enlarging the CQ we try to access elements beyond the size
    of the current cq->buf and eventually hit a kernel panic.

    sched/fair: Make sure to update tg contrib for blocked load
    
    commit 02da26ad5ed6ea8680e5d01f20661439611ed776 upstream.
    
    During the update of fair blocked load (__update_blocked_fair()), we
    update the contribution of the cfs in tg->load_avg if cfs_rq's pelt
    has decayed.  Nevertheless, the pelt values of a cfs_rq could have
    been recently updated while propagating the change of a child. In this
    case, cfs_rq's pelt will not decayed because it has already been
    updated and we don't update tg->load_avg.
    
    __update_blocked_fair
      ...
      for_each_leaf_cfs_rq_safe: child cfs_rq
        update cfs_rq_load_avg() for child cfs_rq

          ...
          update cfs_rq_load_avg() for parent cfs_rq
                    -propagation of child's load makes parent cfs_rq->load_sum
                     becoming null
            -UPDATE_TG is not set so it doesn't update parent

    perf: Fix data race between pin_count increment/decrement
    
    commit 6c605f8371159432ec61cbb1488dcf7ad24ad19a upstream.

    Because neither read-modify-write here is atomic, this can lead to one
    of the operations being lost, resulting in an inconsistent pin_count.
    Fix it by adding the missing locking in the CPU-event case.

    vmlinux.lds.h: Avoid orphan section with !SMP
    
    commit d4c6399900364facd84c9e35ce1540b6046c345f upstream.
    
    With x86_64_defconfig and the following configs, there is an orphan
    section warning:
    
    CONFIG_SMP=n
    CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT=y
    CONFIG_HYPERVISOR_GUEST=y
    CONFIG_KVM=y

    ld: warning: orphan section `.data..decrypted' from `arch/x86/kernel/kvm.o' being placed in section `.data..decrypted'
    
    These sections are created with DEFINE_PER_CPU_DECRYPTED, which
    ultimately turns into __PCPU_ATTRS, which in turn has a section
    attribute with a value of PER_CPU_BASE_SECTION + the section name. When
    CONFIG_SMP is not set, the base section is .data and that is not
    currently handled in any linker script.
    
    Add .data..decrypted to PERCPU_DECRYPTED_SECTION, which is included in
    PERCPU_INPUT -> PERCPU_SECTION, which is include in the x86 linker
    script when either CONFIG_X86_64 or CONFIG_SMP is unset, taking care of
    the warning.

    RDMA/mlx4: Do not map the core_clock page to user space unless enabled
    
    commit 404e5a12691fe797486475fe28cc0b80cb8bef2c upstream.
    
    Currently when mlx4 maps the hca_core_clock page to the user space there
    are read-modifiable registers, one of which is semaphore, on this page as
    well as the clock counter. If user reads the wrong offset, it can modify
    the semaphore and hang the device.
    
    Do not map the hca_core_clock page to the user space unless the device has
    been put in a backwards compatibility mode to support this feature.
    
    After this patch, mlx4 core_clock won't be mapped to user space on the
    majority of existing devices and the uverbs device time feature in
    ibv_query_rt_values_ex() will be disabled.

    usb: fix various gadget panics on 10gbps cabling
    
    commit 032e288097a553db5653af552dd8035cd2a0ba96 upstream.
    
    usb_assign_descriptors() is called with 5 parameters,
    the last 4 of which are the usb_descriptor_header for:
      full-speed (USB1.1 - 12Mbps [including USB1.0 low-speed @ 1.5Mbps),
      high-speed (USB2.0 - 480Mbps),
      super-speed (USB3.0 - 5Gbps),
      super-speed-plus (USB3.1 - 10Gbps).
    
    The differences between full/high/super-speed descriptors are usually
    substantial (due to changes in the maximum usb block size from 64 to 512
    to 1024 bytes and other differences in the specs), while the difference
    between 5 and 10Gbps descriptors may be as little as nothing
    (in many cases the same tuning is simply good enough).
    
    However if a gadget driver calls usb_assign_descriptors() with
    a NULL descriptor for super-speed-plus and is then used on a max 10gbps
    configuration, the kernel will crash with a null pointer dereference,
    when a 10gbps capable device port + cable + host port combination shows up.
    (This wouldn't happen if the gadget max-speed was set to 5gbps, but
    it of course defaults to the maximum, and there's no real reason to
    artificially limit it)
    
    The fix is to simply use the 5gbps descriptor as the 10gbps descriptor,
    if a 10gbps descriptor wasn't provided.
    
    Obviously this won't fix the problem if the 5gbps descriptor is also
    NULL, but such cases can't be so trivially solved (and any such gadgets
    are unlikely to be used with USB3 ports any way).

    The direction of the pipe argument must match the request-type direction
    bit or control requests may fail depending on the host-controller-driver
    implementation.
    
    Fix the three requests which erroneously used usb_rcvctrlpipe().

    usb: gadget: f_fs: Ensure io_completion_wq is idle during unbind
    
    commit 6fc1db5e6211e30fbb1cee8d7925d79d4ed2ae14 upstream.
    
    During unbind, ffs_func_eps_disable() will be executed, resulting in
    completion callbacks for any pending USB requests.  When using AIO,
    irrespective of the completion status, io_data work is queued to
    io_completion_wq to evaluate and handle the completed requests.  Since
    work runs asynchronously to the unbind() routine, there can be a
    scenario where the work runs after the USB gadget has been fully
    removed, resulting in accessing of a resource which has been already
    freed. (i.e. usb_ep_free_request() accessing the USB ep structure)
    
    Explicitly drain the io_completion_wq, instead of relying on the
    destroy_workqueue() (in ffs_data_put()) to make sure no pending
    completion work items are running.

    usb: typec: ucsi: Clear PPM capability data in ucsi_init() error path
    
    commit f247f0a82a4f8c3bfed178d8fd9e069d1424ee4e upstream.
    
    If ucsi_init() fails for some reason (e.g. ucsi_register_port()
    fails or general communication failure to the PPM), particularly at
    any point after the GET_CAPABILITY command had been issued, this
    results in unwinding the initialization and returning an error.
    However the ucsi structure's ucsi_capability member retains its
    current value, including likely a non-zero num_connectors.
    And because ucsi_init() itself is done in a workqueue a UCSI
    interface driver will be unaware that it failed and may think the
    ucsi_register() call was completely successful.  Later, if
    ucsi_unregister() is called, due to this stale ucsi->cap value it
    would try to access the items in the ucsi->connector array which
    might not be in a proper state or not even allocated at all and
    results in NULL or invalid pointer dereference.
    
    Fix this by clearing the ucsi->cap value to 0 during the error
    path of ucsi_init() in order to prevent a later ucsi_unregister()
    from entering the connector cleanup loop.

    usb: dwc3: ep0: fix NULL pointer exception
    
    commit d00889080ab60051627dab1d85831cd9db750e2a upstream.
    
    There is no validation of the index from dwc3_wIndex_to_dep() and we might
    be referring a non-existing ep and trigger a NULL pointer exception. In
    certain configurations we might use fewer eps and the index might wrongly
    indicate a larger ep index than existing.
    
    By adding this validation from the patch we can actually report a wrong
    index back to the caller.
    
    In our usecase we are using a composite device on an older kernel, but
    upstream might use this fix also. Unfortunately, I cannot describe the
    hardware for others to reproduce the issue as it is a proprietary
    implementation.

    to the lower bound 310ms to ensure the timeout is in Spec.

    usb: f_ncm: only first packet of aggregate needs to start timer
    
    commit 1958ff5ad2d4908b44a72bcf564dfe67c981e7fe upstream.
    
    The reasoning for this change is that if we already had
    a packet pending, then we also already had a pending timer,
    and as such there is no need to reschedule it.
    
    This also prevents packets getting delayed 60 ms worst case
    under a tiny packet every 290us transmit load, by keeping the
    timeout always relative to the first queued up packet.
    (300us delay * 16KB max aggregation / 80 byte packet =~ 60 ms)
    
    As such the first packet is now at most delayed by 300us.
    
    Under low transmit load, this will simply result in us sending
    a shorter aggregate, as originally intended.
    
    This patch has the benefit of greatly reducing (by ~10 factor
    with 1500 byte frames aggregated into 16 kiB) the number of
    (potentially pretty costly) updates to the hrtimer.

    kvm: avoid speculation-based attacks from out-of-range memslot accesses
    
    commit da27a83fd6cc7780fea190e1f5c19e87019da65c upstream.
    
    KVM's mechanism for accessing guest memory translates a guest physical
    address (gpa) to a host virtual address using the right-shifted gpa
    (also known as gfn) and a struct kvm_memory_slot.  The translation is
    performed in __gfn_to_hva_memslot using the following formula:
    
          hva = slot->userspace_addr + (gfn - slot->base_gfn) * PAGE_SIZE
    
    It is expected that gfn falls within the boundaries of the guest's
    physical memory.  However, a guest can access invalid physical addresses
    in such a way that the gfn is invalid.
    
    __gfn_to_hva_memslot is called from kvm_vcpu_gfn_to_hva_prot, which first
    retrieves a memslot through __gfn_to_memslot.  While __gfn_to_memslot
    does check that the gfn falls within the boundaries of the guest's
    physical memory or not, a CPU can speculate the result of the check and
    continue execution speculatively using an illegal gfn. The speculation
    can result in calculating an out-of-bounds hva.  If the resulting host
    virtual address is used to load another guest physical address, this
    is effectively a Spectre gadget consisting of two consecutive reads,
    the second of which is data dependent on the first.
    
    Right now it's not clear if there are any cases in which this is
    exploitable.  One interesting case was reported by the original author
    of this patch, and involves visiting guest page tables on x86.  Right
    now these are not vulnerable because the hva read goes through get_user(),
    which contains an LFENCE speculation barrier.  However, there are
    patches in progress for x86 uaccess.h to mask kernel addresses instead of
    using LFENCE; once these land, a guest could use speculation to read
    from the VMM's ring 3 address space.  Other architectures such as ARM
    already use the address masking method, and would be susceptible to
    this same kind of data-dependent access gadgets.  Therefore, this patch
    proactively protects from these attacks by masking out-of-bounds gfns
    in __gfn_to_hva_memslot, which blocks speculation of invalid hvas.
    
    Sean Christopherson noted that this patch does not cover
    kvm_read_guest_offset_cached.  This however is limited to a few bytes
    past the end of the cache, and therefore it is unlikely to be useful in
    the context of building a chain of data dependent accesses.

    drm: Lock pointer access in drm_master_release()
    
    commit c336a5ee984708db4826ef9e47d184e638e29717 upstream.
    
    This patch eliminates the following smatch warning:
    drivers/gpu/drm/drm_auth.c:320 drm_master_release() warn: unlocked access 'master' (line 318) expected lock '&dev->master_mutex'
    
    The 'file_priv->master' field should be protected by the mutex lock to
    '&dev->master_mutex'. This is because other processes can concurrently
    modify this field and free the current 'file_priv->master'
    pointer. This could result in a use-after-free error when 'master' is
    dereferenced in subsequent function calls to
    'drm_legacy_lock_master_cleanup()' or to 'drm_lease_revoke()'.
    
    An example of a scenario that would produce this error can be seen
    from a similar bug in 'drm_getunique()' that was reported by Syzbot:
    https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=148d2f1dfac64af52ffd27b661981a540724f803
    
    In the Syzbot report, another process concurrently acquired the
    device's master mutex in 'drm_setmaster_ioctl()', then overwrote
    'fpriv->master' in 'drm_new_set_master()'. The old value of
    'fpriv->master' was subsequently freed before the mutex was unlocked.

    drm: Fix use-after-free read in drm_getunique()
    
    commit b436acd1cf7fac0ba987abd22955d98025c80c2b upstream.
    
    There is a time-of-check-to-time-of-use error in drm_getunique() due
    to retrieving file_priv->master prior to locking the device's master
    mutex.
    
    An example can be seen in the crash report of the use-after-free error
    found by Syzbot:
    https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=148d2f1dfac64af52ffd27b661981a540724f803
    
    In the report, the master pointer was used after being freed. This is
    because another process had acquired the device's master mutex in
    drm_setmaster_ioctl(), then overwrote fpriv->master in
    drm_new_set_master(). The old value of fpriv->master was subsequently
    freed before the mutex was unlocked.
    
    To fix this, we lock the device's master mutex before retrieving the
    pointer from from fpriv->master. This patch passes the Syzbot
    reproducer test.

    Per schematic, both PU and SOC regulator are supplied from LTC3676 SW1
    via VDDSOC_IN rail, add the PU input. Both VDD1P1, VDD2P5 are supplied
    from LTC3676 SW2 via VDDHIGH_IN rail, add both inputs.
    
    While no instability or problems are currently observed, the regulators
    should be fully described in DT and that description should fully match
    the hardware, else this might lead to unforseen issues later. Fix this.

    MIPS: Fix kernel hang under FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER and PREEMPT_TRACER
    
    [ Upstream commit 78cf0eb926cb1abeff2106bae67752e032fe5f3e ]
    
    When update the latest mainline kernel with the following three configs,
    the kernel hangs during startup:
    
    (1) CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER=y
    (2) CONFIG_PREEMPT_TRACER=y
    (3) CONFIG_FTRACE_STARTUP_TEST=y
    
    When update the latest mainline kernel with the above two configs (1)
    and (2), the kernel starts normally, but it still hangs when execute
    the following command:
    
    echo "function_graph" > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
    
    Without CONFIG_PREEMPT_TRACER=y, the above two kinds of kernel hangs
    disappeared, so it seems that CONFIG_PREEMPT_TRACER has some influences
    with function_graph tracer at the first glance.
    
    I use ejtag to find out the epc address is related with preempt_enable()
    in the file arch/mips/lib/mips-atomic.c, because function tracing can
    trace the preempt_{enable,disable} calls that are traced, replace them
    with preempt_{enable,disable}_notrace to prevent function tracing from
    going into an infinite loop, and then it can fix the kernel hang issue.
    
    By the way, it seems that this commit is a complement and improvement of
    commit f93a1a00f2bd ("MIPS: Fix crash that occurs when function tracing
    is enabled").

    scsi: target: qla2xxx: Wait for stop_phase1 at WWN removal
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ef7665dfd88830f15415ba007c7c9a46be7acd8 ]
    
    Target de-configuration panics at high CPU load because TPGT and WWPN can
    be removed on separate threads.
    
    TPGT removal requests a reset HBA on a separate thread and waits for reset
    complete (phase1). Due to high CPU load that HBA reset can be delayed for
    some time.
    
    WWPN removal does qlt_stop_phase2(). There it is believed that phase1 has
    already completed and thus tgt.tgt_ops is subsequently cleared. However,
    tgt.tgt_ops is needed to process incoming traffic and therefore this will
    cause one of the following panics:

    completion.

    RDS tcp loopback connection can hang
    
    [ Upstream commit aced3ce57cd37b5ca332bcacd370d01f5a8c5371 ]
    
    When TCP is used as transport and a program on the
    system connects to RDS port 16385, connection is
    accepted but denied per the rules of RDS. However,
    RDS connections object is left in the list. Next
    loopback connection will select that connection
    object as it is at the head of list. The connection
    attempt will hang as the connection object is set
    to connect over TCP which is not allowed
    
    The issue can be reproduced easily, use rds-ping
    to ping a local IP address. After that use any
    program like ncat to connect to the same IP
    address and port 16385. This will hang so ctrl-c out.
    Now try rds-ping, it will hang.
    
    To fix the issue this patch adds checks to disallow
    the connection object creation and destroys the
    connection object.

    net/qla3xxx: fix schedule while atomic in ql_sem_spinlock
    
    [ Upstream commit 13a6f3153922391e90036ba2267d34eed63196fc ]
    
    When calling the 'ql_sem_spinlock', the driver has already acquired the
    spin lock, so the driver should not call 'ssleep' in atomic context.
    
    This bug can be fixed by using 'mdelay' instead of 'ssleep'.

    wq: handle VM suspension in stall detection
    
    [ Upstream commit 940d71c6462e8151c78f28e4919aa8882ff2054e ]
    
    If VCPU is suspended (VM suspend) in wq_watchdog_timer_fn() then
    once this VCPU resumes it will see the new jiffies value, while it
    may take a while before IRQ detects PVCLOCK_GUEST_STOPPED on this
    VCPU and updates all the watchdogs via pvclock_touch_watchdogs().
    There is a small chance of misreported WQ stalls in the meantime,
    because new jiffies is time_after() old 'ts + thresh'.
    
    wq_watchdog_timer_fn()
    {
            for_each_pool(pool, pi) {
                    if (time_after(jiffies, ts + thresh)) {
                            pr_emerg("BUG: workqueue lockup - pool");
                    }
            }
    }
    
    Save jiffies at the beginning of this function and use that value
    for stall detection. If VM gets suspended then we continue using
    "old" jiffies value and old WQ touch timestamps. If IRQ at some
    point restarts the stall detection cycle (pvclock_touch_watchdogs())
    then old jiffies will always be before new 'ts + thresh'.

    cgroup: disable controllers at parse time
    
    [ Upstream commit 45e1ba40837ac2f6f4d4716bddb8d44bd7e4a251 ]
    
    This patch effectively reverts the commit a3e72739b7a7 ("cgroup: fix
    too early usage of static_branch_disable()"). The commit 6041186a3258
    ("init: initialize jump labels before command line option parsing") has
    moved the jump_label_init() before parse_args() which has made the
    commit a3e72739b7a7 unnecessary. On the other hand there are
    consequences of disabling the controllers later as there are subsystems
    doing the controller checks for different decisions. One such incident
    is reported [1] regarding the memory controller and its impact on memory
    reclaim code.

    netlink: disable IRQs for netlink_lock_table()
    
    [ Upstream commit 1d482e666b8e74c7555dbdfbfb77205eeed3ff2d ]
    
    Syzbot reports that in mac80211 we have a potential deadlock
    between our "local->stop_queue_reasons_lock" (spinlock) and
    netlink's nl_table_lock (rwlock). This is because there's at
    least one situation in which we might try to send a netlink
    message with this spinlock held while it is also possible to
    take the spinlock from a hardirq context, resulting in the
    following deadlock scenario reported by lockdep:
    
           CPU0                    CPU1
           ----                    ----
      lock(nl_table_lock);
                                   local_irq_disable();
                                   lock(&local->queue_stop_reason_lock);
                                   lock(nl_table_lock);
      <Interrupt>
        lock(&local->queue_stop_reason_lock);
    
    This seems valid, we can take the queue_stop_reason_lock in
    any kind of context ("CPU0"), and call ieee80211_report_ack_skb()
    with the spinlock held and IRQs disabled ("CPU1") in some
    code path (ieee80211_do_stop() via ieee80211_free_txskb()).
    
    Short of disallowing netlink use in scenarios like these
    (which would be rather complex in mac80211's case due to
    the deep callchain), it seems the only fix for this is to
    disable IRQs while nl_table_lock is held to avoid hitting
    this scenario, this disallows the "CPU0" portion of the
    reported deadlock.
    
    Note that the writer side (netlink_table_grab()) already
    disables IRQs for this lock.
    
    Unfortunately though, this seems like a huge hammer, and
    maybe the whole netlink table locking should be reworked.

    bonding: init notify_work earlier to avoid uninitialized use
    
    [ Upstream commit 35d96e631860226d5dc4de0fad0a415362ec2457 ]
    
    If bond_kobj_init() or later kzalloc() in bond_alloc_slave() fail,
    then we call kobject_put() on the slave->kobj. This in turn calls
    the release function slave_kobj_release() which will always try to
    cancel_delayed_work_sync(&slave->notify_work), which shouldn't be
    done on an uninitialized work struct.
    
    Always initialize the work struct earlier to avoid problems here.
    
    Syzbot bisected this down to a completely pointless commit, some
    fault injection may have been at work here that caused the alloc
    failure in the first place, which may interact badly with bisect.

    'nj_setup' in netjet.c might fail with -EIO and in this case
    'card->irq' is initialized and is bigger than zero. A subsequent call to
    'nj_release' will free the irq that has not been requested.
    
    Fix this bug by deleting the previous assignment to 'card->irq' and just
    keep the assignment before 'request_irq'.

    net/nfc/rawsock.c: fix a permission check bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ab78863e9eff11910e1ac8bcf478060c29b379e ]
    
    The function rawsock_create() calls a privileged function sk_alloc(), which requires a ns-aware check to check net->user_ns, i.e., ns_capable(). However, the original code checks the init_user_ns using capable(). So we replace the capable() with ns_capable().

    proc: Track /proc/$pid/attr/ opener mm_struct
    
    commit 591a22c14d3f45cc38bd1931c593c221df2f1881 upstream.
    
    Commit bfb819ea20ce ("proc: Check /proc/$pid/attr/ writes against file opener")
    tried to make sure that there could not be a confusion between the opener of
    a /proc/$pid/attr/ file and the writer. It used struct cred to make sure
    the privileges didn't change. However, there were existing cases where a more
    privileged thread was passing the opened fd to a differently privileged thread
    (during container setup). Instead, use mm_struct to track whether the opener
    and writer are still the same process. (This is what several other proc files
    already do, though for different reasons.)
