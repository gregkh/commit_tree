    net: fec: fix clock count mis-match
    
    commit a31eda65ba210741b598044d045480494d0ed52a upstream.
    
    pm_runtime_put_autosuspend in probe will call runtime suspend to
    disable clks automatically if CONFIG_PM is defined. (If CONFIG_PM
    is not defined, its implementation will be empty, then runtime
    suspend will not be called.)
    
    Therefore, we can call pm_runtime_get_sync to runtime resume it
    first to enable clks, which matches the runtime suspend. (Only when
    CONFIG_PM is defined, otherwise pm_runtime_get_sync will also be
    empty, then runtime resume will not be called.)
    
    Then it is fine to disable clks without causing clock count mis-match.

    platform/x86: hp-wmi: Fix ACPI errors caused by too small buffer
    
    commit 16245db1489cd9aa579506f64afeeeb13d825a93 upstream.
    
    The HP WMI calls may take up to 128 bytes of data as input, and
    the AML methods implementing the WMI calls, declare a couple of fields for
    accessing input in different sizes, specifycally the HWMC method contains:
    
            CreateField (Arg1, 0x80, 0x0400, D128)
    
    Even though we do not use any of the WMI command-types which need a buffer
    of this size, the APCI interpreter still tries to create it as it is
    declared in generoc code at the top of the HWMC method which runs before
    the code looks at which command-type is requested.
    
    This results in many of these errors on many different HP laptop models:
    
    [   14.459261] ACPI Error: Field [D128] at 1152 exceeds Buffer [NULL] size 160 (bits) (20170303/dsopcode-236)
    [   14.459268] ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed [\HWMC] (Node ffff8edcc61507f8), AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT (20170303/psparse-543)
    [   14.459279] ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed [\_SB.WMID.WMAA] (Node ffff8edcc61523c0), AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT (20170303/psparse-543)
    
    This commit increases the size of the data element of the bios_args struct
    to 128 bytes fixing these errors.

    HID: core: check whether Usage Page item is after Usage ID items
    
    commit 1cb0d2aee26335d0bccf29100c7bed00ebece851 upstream.
    
    Upstream commit 58e75155009c ("HID: core: move Usage Page concatenation
    to Main item") adds support for Usage Page item after Usage ID items
    (such as keyboards manufactured by Primax).
    
    Usage Page concatenation in Main item works well for following report
    descriptor patterns:
    
        USAGE_PAGE (Keyboard)                   05 07
        USAGE_MINIMUM (Keyboard LeftControl)    19 E0
        USAGE_MAXIMUM (Keyboard Right GUI)      29 E7
        LOGICAL_MINIMUM (0)                     15 00
        LOGICAL_MAXIMUM (1)                     25 01
        REPORT_SIZE (1)                         75 01
        REPORT_COUNT (8)                        95 08
        INPUT (Data,Var,Abs)                    81 02
    
    -------------
    
        USAGE_MINIMUM (Keyboard LeftControl)    19 E0
        USAGE_MAXIMUM (Keyboard Right GUI)      29 E7
        LOGICAL_MINIMUM (0)                     15 00
        LOGICAL_MAXIMUM (1)                     25 01
        REPORT_SIZE (1)                         75 01
        REPORT_COUNT (8)                        95 08
        USAGE_PAGE (Keyboard)                   05 07
        INPUT (Data,Var,Abs)                    81 02
    
    But it makes the parser act wrong for the following report
    descriptor pattern(such as some Gamepads):
    
        USAGE_PAGE (Button)                     05 09
        USAGE (Button 1)                        09 01
        USAGE (Button 2)                        09 02
        USAGE (Button 4)                        09 04
        USAGE (Button 5)                        09 05
        USAGE (Button 7)                        09 07
        USAGE (Button 8)                        09 08
        USAGE (Button 14)                       09 0E
        USAGE (Button 15)                       09 0F
        USAGE (Button 13)                       09 0D
        USAGE_PAGE (Consumer Devices)           05 0C
        USAGE (Back)                            0a 24 02
        USAGE (HomePage)                        0a 23 02
        LOGICAL_MINIMUM (0)                     15 00
        LOGICAL_MAXIMUM (1)                     25 01
        REPORT_SIZE (1)                         75 01
        REPORT_COUNT (11)                       95 0B
        INPUT (Data,Var,Abs)                    81 02
    
    With Usage Page concatenation in Main item, parser recognizes all the
    11 Usages as consumer keys, it is not the HID device's real intention.
    
    This patch checks whether Usage Page is really defined after Usage ID
    items by comparing usage page using status.
    
    Usage Page concatenation on currently defined Usage Page will always
    do in local parsing when Usage ID items encountered.
    
    When Main item is parsing, concatenation will do again with last
    defined Usage Page if this page has not been used in the previous
    usages concatenation.

    net: sched: fix `tc -s class show` no bstats on class with nolock subqueues
    
    [ Upstream commit 14e54ab9143fa60794d13ea0a66c792a2046a8f3 ]
    
    When a classful qdisc's child qdisc has set the flag
    TCQ_F_CPUSTATS (pfifo_fast for example), the child qdisc's
    cpu_bstats should be passed to gnet_stats_copy_basic(),
    but many classful qdisc didn't do that. As a result,
    `tc -s class show dev DEV` always return 0 for bytes and
    packets in this case.
    
    Pass the child qdisc's cpu_bstats to gnet_stats_copy_basic()
    to fix this issue.
    
    The qstats also has this problem, but it has been fixed
    in 5dd431b6b9 ("net: sched: introduce and use qstats read...")
    and bstats still remains buggy.

    It was caused by rhashtable access asoc->base.sk when sctp_assoc_migrate
    is changing its value. However, what rhashtable wants is netns from asoc
    base.sk, and for an asoc, its netns won't change once set. So we can
    simply fix it by caching netns since created.

    slip_devs device list. On next open after failure this list is iterated
    and freed device is accessed. Fix this by calling sl_free_netdev in error

    When user-space sets the OVS_UFID_F_OMIT_* flags, and the relevant
    flow has no UFID, we can exceed the computed size, as
    ovs_nla_put_identifier() will always dump an OVS_FLOW_ATTR_KEY
    attribute.
    Take the above in account when computing the flow command message
    size.

    macvlan: schedule bc_work even if error
    
    [ Upstream commit 1d7ea55668878bb350979c377fc72509dd6f5b21 ]
    
    While enqueueing a broadcast skb to port->bc_queue, schedule_work()
    is called to add port->bc_work, which processes the skbs in
    bc_queue, to "events" work queue. If port->bc_queue is full, the
    skb will be discarded and schedule_work(&port->bc_work) won't be
    called. However, if port->bc_queue is full and port->bc_work is not
    running or pending, port->bc_queue will keep full and schedule_work()
    won't be called any more, and all broadcast skbs to macvlan will be
    discarded. This case can happen:
    
    macvlan_process_broadcast() is the pending function of port->bc_work,
    it moves all the skbs in port->bc_queue to the queue "list", and
    processes the skbs in "list". During this, new skbs will keep being
    added to port->bc_queue in macvlan_broadcast_enqueue(), and
    port->bc_queue may already full when macvlan_process_broadcast()
    return. This may happen, especially when there are a lot of real-time
    threads and the process is preempted.
    
    Fix this by calling schedule_work(&port->bc_work) even if
    port->bc_work is full in macvlan_broadcast_enqueue().

    commit 1e4e25c4959c10728fbfcc6a286f9503d32dfe02 upstream.
    
    The subsystem will free the asd memory on notifier cleanup, if the asd is
    added to the notifier.
    However the memory is freed using kfree.
    Thus, we cannot allocate the asd using devm_*
    This can lead to crashes and problems.
    To test this issue, just return an error at probe, but cleanup the
    notifier beforehand.

    The variable skb is released via kfree_skb() when the return value of

    read its length, which may result in a use after free bug. This patch

    mm, gup: add missing refcount overflow checks on x86 and s390
    
    The mainline commit 8fde12ca79af ("mm: prevent get_user_pages() from
    overflowing page refcount") was backported to 4.9.y stable as commit
    2ed768cfd895. The backport however missed that in 4.9, there are several
    arch-specific gup.c versions with fast gup implementations, so these do not
    prevent refcount overflow.
    
    This is partially fixed for x86 in stable-only commit d73af79742e7 ("x86, mm,
    gup: prevent get_page() race with munmap in paravirt guest"). This stable-only
    commit adds missing parts to x86 version, as well as s390 version, both taken
    from the SUSE SLES/openSUSE 4.12-based kernels.
    
    The remaining architectures with own gup.c are sparc, mips, sh. It's unlikely
    the known overflow scenario based on FUSE, which needs 140GB of RAM, is a
    problem for those architectures, and I don't feel confident enough to patch
    them.

    ACPI / APEI: Switch estatus pool to use vmalloc memory
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ac234be1a9497498e57d958f4251f5257b116b4 ]
    
    The ghes code is careful to parse and round firmware's advertised
    memory requirements for CPER records, up to a maximum of 64K.
    However when ghes_estatus_pool_expand() does its work, it splits
    the requested size into PAGE_SIZE granules.
    
    This means if firmware generates 5K of CPER records, and correctly
    describes this in the table, __process_error() will silently fail as it
    is unable to allocate more than PAGE_SIZE.
    
    Switch the estatus pool to vmalloc() memory. On x86 vmalloc() memory
    may fault and be fixed up by vmalloc_fault(). To prevent this call
    vmalloc_sync_all() before an NMI handler could discover the memory.

       +----------+             +----------+
    
    According to Serial Attached SCSI - 1.1 (SAS-1.1):
    If an expander PHY attached to a SATA PHY is using a physical link rate
    greater than the maximum connection rate supported by the pathway from an
    STP initiator port, a management application client should use the SMP PHY
    CONTROL function (see 10.4.3.10) to set the PROGRAMMED MAXIMUM PHYSICAL
    LINK RATE field of the expander PHY to the maximum connection rate
    supported by the pathway from that STP initiator port.
    
    Currently libsas does not support checking if this condition occurs, nor
    rectifying when it does.
    
    Such a condition is not at all common, however it has been seen on some
    pre-silicon environments where the initiator PHY only supports a 1.5 Gbit
    maximum linkrate, mated with 12G expander PHYs and 3/6G SATA phy.
    
    This patch adds support for checking and rectifying this condition during
    initial device discovery only.
    
    We do support checking min pathway connection rate during revalidation phase,
    when new devices can be detected in the topology. However we do not
    support in the case of the the user reprogramming PHY linkrates, such that
    min pathway condition is not met/maintained.
    
    A note on root port PHY rates:
    The libsas root port PHY rates calculation is broken. Libsas sets the
    rates (min, max, and current linkrate) of a root port to the same linkrate
    of the first PHY member of that same port. In doing so, it assumes that
    all other PHYs which subsequently join the port to have the same
    negotiated linkrate, when they could actually be different.
    
    In practice this doesn't happen, as initiator and expander PHYs are
    normally initialised with consistent min/max linkrates.
    
    This has not caused an issue so far, so leave alone for now.

    sctp: don't compare hb_timer expire date before starting it
    
    [ Upstream commit d1f20c03f48102e52eb98b8651d129b83134cae4 ]
    
    hb_timer might not start at all for a particular transport because its
    start is conditional. In a result a node is not sending heartbeats.
    
    Function sctp_transport_reset_hb_timer has two roles:
        - initial start of hb_timer for a given transport,
        - update expire date of hb_timer for a given transport.
    The function is optimized to update timer's expire only if it is before
    a new calculated one but this comparison is invalid for a timer which
    has not yet started. Such a timer has expire == 0 and if a new expire
    value is bigger than (MAX_JIFFIES / 2 + 2) then "time_before" macro will
    fail and timer will not start resulting in no heartbeat packets send by
    the node.
    
    This was found when association was initialized within first 5 mins
    after system boot due to jiffies init value which is near to MAX_JIFFIES.
    
    Test kernel version: 4.9.154 (ARCH=arm)
    hb_timer.expire = 0;                //initialized, not started timer
    new_expire = MAX_JIFFIES / 2 + 2;   //or more
    time_before(hb_timer.expire, new_expire) == false

    [ Upstream commit 7384b538d3aed2ed49d3575483d17aeee790fb06 ]
    
    When we free skb at tipc_data_input, we return a 'false' boolean.
    Then, skb passed to subcalling tipc_link_input in tipc_link_rcv,
    
    <snip>
    1303 int tipc_link_rcv:
    ...
    1354    if (!tipc_data_input(l, skb, l->inputq))
    1355        rc |= tipc_link_input(l, skb, l->inputq);
    </snip>
    
    Fix it by simple changing to a 'true' boolean when skb is being free-ed.
    Then, tipc_link_rcv will bypassed to subcalling tipc_link_input as above
    condition.

    decnet: fix DN_IFREQ_SIZE
    
    [ Upstream commit 50c2936634bcb1db78a8ca63249236810c11a80f ]
    
    Digging through the ioctls with Al because of the previous
    patches, we found that on 64-bit decnet's dn_dev_ioctl()
    is wrong, because struct ifreq::ifr_ifru is actually 24
    bytes (not 16 as expected from struct sockaddr) due to the
    ifru_map and ifru_settings members.
    
    Clearly, decnet expects the ioctl to be called with a struct
    like
      struct ifreq_dn {
        char ifr_name[IFNAMSIZ];
        struct sockaddr_dn ifr_addr;
      };
    
    since it does
      struct ifreq *ifr = ...;
      struct sockaddr_dn *sdn = (struct sockaddr_dn *)&ifr->ifr_addr;
    
    This means that DN_IFREQ_SIZE is too big for what it wants on
    64-bit, as it is
      sizeof(struct ifreq) - sizeof(struct sockaddr) +
      sizeof(struct sockaddr_dn)
    
    This assumes that sizeof(struct sockaddr) is the size of ifr_ifru
    but that isn't true.
    
    Fix this to use offsetof(struct ifreq, ifr_ifru).
    
    This indeed doesn't really matter much - the result is that we
    copy in/out 8 bytes more than we should on 64-bit platforms. In
    case the "struct ifreq_dn" lands just on the end of a page though
    it might lead to faults.
    
    As far as I can tell, it has been like this forever, so it seems
    very likely that nobody cares.

    [ Upstream commit 3366463513f544c12c6b88c13da4462ee9e7a1a1 ]
    
    Use a bitmap to keep track of which partition types we've already seen;
     for duplicates, return -EEXIST from efx_ef10_mtd_probe_partition() and
     thus skip adding that partition.
    Duplicate partitions occur because of the A/B backup scheme used by newer
     sfc NICs.  Prior to this patch they cause sysfs_warn_dup errors because
     they have the same name, causing us not to expose any MTDs at all.

    different allocation algorithms.  With gen_pool_first_fit_align()
    allocation function, the returned address should be aligned on the
    requested boundary.
    
    If chunk start address isn't aligned on the requested boundary, the
    returned address isn't aligned too.  The only way to get properly
    aligned address is to initialize the pool with chunks aligned on the
    requested boundary.  If want to have an ability to allocate buffers
    aligned on different boundaries (for example, 4K, 1MB, ...), the chunk
    start address should be aligned on the max possible alignment.
    
    This happens because gen_pool_first_fit_align() looks for properly
    aligned memory block without taking into account the chunk start address
    alignment.
    
    To fix this, we provide chunk start address to
    gen_pool_first_fit_align() and change its implementation such that it
    starts looking for properly aligned block with appropriate offset
    (exactly as is done in CMA).

    vmscan: return NODE_RECLAIM_NOSCAN in node_reclaim() when CONFIG_NUMA is n
    
    [ Upstream commit 8b09549c2bfd9f3f8f4cdad74107ef4f4ff9cdd7 ]
    
    Commit fa5e084e43eb ("vmscan: do not unconditionally treat zones that
    fail zone_reclaim() as full") changed the return value of
    node_reclaim().  The original return value 0 means NODE_RECLAIM_SOME
    after this commit.
    
    While the return value of node_reclaim() when CONFIG_NUMA is n is not
    changed.  This will leads to call zone_watermark_ok() again.
    
    This patch fixes the return value by adjusting to NODE_RECLAIM_NOSCAN.
    Since node_reclaim() is only called in page_alloc.c, move it to
    mm/internal.h.

    drbd: do not block when adjusting "disk-options" while IO is frozen
    
    [ Upstream commit f708bd08ecbdc23d03aaedf5b3311ebe44cfdb50 ]
    
    "suspending" IO is overloaded.
    It can mean "do not allow new requests" (obviously),
    but it also may mean "must not complete pending IO",
    for example while the fencing handlers do their arbitration.
    
    When adjusting disk options, we suspend io (disallow new requests), then
    wait for the activity-log to become unused (drain all IO completions),
    and possibly replace it with a new activity log of different size.
    
    If the other "suspend IO" aspect is active, pending IO completions won't
    happen, and we would block forever (unkillable drbdsetup process).
    
    Fix this by skipping the activity log adjustment if the "al-extents"
    setting did not change. Also, in case it did change, fail early without
    blocking if it looks like we would block forever.

    drbd: reject attach of unsuitable uuids even if connected
    
    [ Upstream commit fe43ed97bba3b11521abd934b83ed93143470e4f ]
    
    Multiple failure scenario:
    a) all good
       Connected Primary/Secondary UpToDate/UpToDate
    b) lose disk on Primary,
       Connected Primary/Secondary Diskless/UpToDate
    c) continue to write to the device,
       changes only make it to the Secondary storage.
    d) lose disk on Secondary,
       Connected Primary/Secondary Diskless/Diskless
    e) now try to re-attach on Primary
    
    This would have succeeded before, even though that is clearly the
    wrong data set to attach to (missing the modifications from c).
    Because we only compared our "effective" and the "to-be-attached"
    data generation uuid tags if (device->state.conn < C_CONNECTED).
    
    Fix: change that constraint to (device->state.pdsk != D_UP_TO_DATE)
    compare the uuids, and reject the attach.
    
    This patch also tries to improve the reverse scenario:
    first lose Secondary, then Primary disk,
    then try to attach the disk on Secondary.
    
    Before this patch, the attach on the Secondary succeeds, but since commit
    drbd: disconnect, if the wrong UUIDs are attached on a connected peer
    the Primary will notice unsuitable data, and drop the connection hard.
    
    Though unfortunately at a point in time during the handshake where
    we cannot easily abort the attach on the peer without more
    refactoring of the handshake.
    
    We now reject any attach to "unsuitable" uuids,
    as long as we can see a Primary role,
    unless we already have access to "good" data.

    drbd: ignore "all zero" peer volume sizes in handshake
    
    [ Upstream commit 94c43a13b8d6e3e0dd77b3536b5e04a84936b762 ]
    
    During handshake, if we are diskless ourselves, we used to accept any size
    presented by the peer.
    
    Which could be zero if that peer was just brought up and connected
    to us without having a disk attached first, in which case both
    peers would just "flip" their volume sizes.
    
    Now, even a diskless node will ignore "zero" sizes
    presented by a diskless peer.
    
    Also a currently Diskless Primary will refuse to shrink during handshake:
    it may be frozen, and waiting for a "suitable" local disk or peer to
    re-appear (on-no-data-accessible suspend-io). If the peer is smaller
    than what we used to be, it is not suitable.
    
    The logic for a diskless node during handshake is now supposed to be:
    believe the peer, if
     - I don't have a current size myself
     - we agree on the size anyways
     - I do have a current size, am Secondary, and he has the only disk
     - I do have a current size, am Primary, and he has the only disk,
       which is larger than my current size

    vfio/spapr_tce: Get rid of possible infinite loop
    
    [ Upstream commit 517ad4ae8aa93dccdb9a88c27257ecb421c9e848 ]
    
    As a part of cleanup, the SPAPR TCE IOMMU subdriver releases preregistered
    memory. If there is a bug in memory release, the loop in
    tce_iommu_release() becomes infinite; this actually happened to me.
    
    This makes the loop finite and prints a warning on every failure to make
    the code more bug prone.

    powerpc/44x/bamboo: Fix PCI range
    
    [ Upstream commit 3cfb9ebe906b51f2942b1e251009bb251efd2ba6 ]
    
    The bamboo dts has a bug: it uses a non-naturally aligned range
    for PCI memory space. This isnt' supported by the code, thus
    causing PCI to break on this system.
    
    This is due to the fact that while the chip memory map has 1G
    reserved for PCI memory, it's only 512M aligned. The code doesn't
    know how to split that into 2 different PMMs and fails, so limit
    the region to 512M.

    As several other arches including x86, this patch makes it explicit
    that a bad page fault is a NULL pointer dereference when the fault
    address is lower than PAGE_SIZE
    
    In the mean time, this page makes all bad_page_fault() messages

    by "BUG: " so that they get easily grepped.

    scsi: qla2xxx: deadlock by configfs_depend_item
    
    [ Upstream commit 17b18eaa6f59044a5172db7d07149e31ede0f920 ]
    
    The intent of invoking configfs_depend_item in commit 7474f52a82d51
    ("tcm_qla2xxx: Perform configfs depend/undepend for base_tpg")
    was to prevent a physical Fibre Channel port removal when
    virtual (NPIV) ports announced through that physical port are active.
    The change does not work as expected: it makes enabled physical port
    dependent on target configfs subsystem (the port's parent), something
    the configfs guarantees anyway.
    
    Besides, scheduling work in a worker thread and waiting for the work's
    completion is not really a valid workaround for the requirement not to call
    configfs_depend_item from a configfs callback: the call occasionally
    deadlocks.
    
    Thus, removing configfs_depend_item calls does not break anything and fixes
    the deadlock problem.

    xfs: Fix bulkstat compat ioctls on x32 userspace.
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ca860e3c1a74ad6bd8949364073ef1044cad758 ]
    
    The bulkstat family of ioctls are problematic on x32, because there is
    a mixup of native 32-bit and 64-bit conventions.  The xfs_fsop_bulkreq
    struct contains pointers and 32-bit integers so that matches the native
    32-bit layout, and that means the ioctl implementation goes into the
    regular compat path on x32.
    
    However, the 'ubuffer' member of that struct in turn refers to either
    struct xfs_inogrp or xfs_bstat (or an array of these).  On x32, those
    structures match the native 64-bit layout.  The compat implementation
    writes out the 32-bit version of these structures.  This is not the
    expected format for x32 userspace, causing problems.
    
    Fortunately the functions which actually output these xfs_inogrp and
    xfs_bstat structures have an easy way to select which output format
    is required, so we just need a little tweak to select the right format
    on x32.

    [ Upstream commit c456d64449efe37da50832b63d91652a85ea1d20 ]
    
    While inspecting the ioctl implementations, I noticed that the compat
    implementation of XFS_IOC_ATTRLIST_BY_HANDLE does not do exactly the
    same thing as the native implementation.  Specifically, the "cursor"
    does not appear to be written out to userspace on the compat path,
    like it is on the native path.
    
    This adjusts the compat implementation to copy out the cursor just
    like the native implementation does.  The attrlist cursor does not
    require any special compat handling.  This fixes xfstests xfs/269
    on both IA-32 and x32 userspace, when running on an amd64 kernel.

    The failure to create debugfs entry is unpleasant event, but not enough
    to abort drier initialization. Align the mlx5_core code to debugfs design
    and continue execution whenever debugfs_create_dir() successes or not.

    pinctrl: xway: fix gpio-hog related boot issues
    
    [ Upstream commit 9b4924da4711674e62d97d4f5360446cc78337af ]
    
    This patch is based on commit a86caa9ba5d7 ("pinctrl: msm: fix gpio-hog
    related boot issues").
    
    It fixes the issue that the gpio ranges needs to be defined before
    gpiochip_add().
    
    Therefore, we also have to swap the order of registering the pinctrl
    driver and registering the gpio chip.
    
    You also have to add the "gpio-ranges" property to the pinctrl device
    node to get it finally working.

    [ Upstream commit 158ffa364bf723fa1ef128060646d23dc3942994 ]
    
    We use this number to figure out how many delayed refs to run, but
    __btrfs_run_delayed_refs really only checks every time we need a new
    delayed ref head, so we always run at least one ref head completely no
    matter what the number of items on it.  Fix the accounting to only be
    adjusted when we add/remove a ref head.
    
    In addition to using this number to limit the number of delayed refs
    run, a future patch is also going to use it to calculate the amount of
    space required for delayed refs space reservation.

    VSOCK: bind to random port for VMADDR_PORT_ANY
    
    [ Upstream commit 8236b08cf50f85bbfaf48910a0b3ee68318b7c4b ]
    
    The old code always starts from fixed port for VMADDR_PORT_ANY. Sometimes
    when VMM crashed, there is still orphaned vsock which is waiting for
    close timer, then it could cause connection time out for new started VM
    if they are trying to connect to same port with same guest cid since the
    new packets could hit that orphaned vsock. We could also fix this by doing
    more in vhost_vsock_reset_orphans, but any way, it should be better to start
    from a random local port instead of a fixed one.

    crypto: user - support incremental algorithm dumps
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ac6b8fb23c724b015d9ca70a89126e8d1563166 ]
    
    CRYPTO_MSG_GETALG in NLM_F_DUMP mode sometimes doesn't return all
    registered crypto algorithms, because it doesn't support incremental
    dumps.  crypto_dump_report() only permits itself to be called once, yet
    the netlink subsystem allocates at most ~64 KiB for the skb being dumped
    to.  Thus only the first recvmsg() returns data, and it may only include
    a subset of the crypto algorithms even if the user buffer passed to
    recvmsg() is large enough to hold all of them.
    
    Fix this by using one of the arguments in the netlink_callback structure
    to keep track of the current position in the algorithm list.  Then
    userspace can do multiple recvmsg() on the socket after sending the dump
    request.  This is the way netlink dumps work elsewhere in the kernel;
    it's unclear why this was different (probably just an oversight).
    
    Also fix an integer overflow when calculating the dump buffer size hint.

    ACPI / LPSS: Ignore acpi_device_fix_up_power() return value
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a2fa02f7489dc4d746f2a15fb77b3ce1affade8 ]
    
    Ignore acpi_device_fix_up_power() return value. If we return an error
    we end up with acpi_default_enumeration() still creating a platform-
    device for the device and we end up with the device still being used
    but without the special LPSS related handling which is not useful.
    
    Specicifically ignoring the error fixes the touchscreen no longer
    working after a suspend/resume on a Prowise PT301 tablet.
    
    This tablet has a broken _PS0 method on the touchscreen's I2C controller,
    causing acpi_device_fix_up_power() to fail, causing fallback to standard
    platform-dev handling and specifically causing acpi_lpss_save/restore_ctx
    to not run.
    
    The I2C controllers _PS0 method does actually turn on the device, but then
    does some more nonsense which fails when run during early boot trying to
    use I2C opregion handling on another not-yet registered I2C controller.

    arm64: mm: Prevent mismatched 52-bit VA support
    
    [ Upstream commit a96a33b1ca57dbea4285893dedf290aeb8eb090b ]
    
    For cases where there is a mismatch in ARMv8.2-LVA support between CPUs
    we have to be careful in allowing secondary CPUs to boot if 52-bit
    virtual addresses have already been enabled on the boot CPU.
    
    This patch adds code to the secondary startup path. If the boot CPU has
    enabled 52-bit VAs then ID_AA64MMFR2_EL1 is checked to see if the
    secondary can also enable 52-bit support. If not, the secondary is
    prevented from booting and an error message is displayed indicating why.
    
    Technically this patch could be implemented using the cpufeature code
    when considering 52-bit userspace support. However, we employ low level
    checks here as the cpufeature code won't be able to run if we have
    mismatched 52-bit kernel va support.

    scripts/gdb: fix debugging modules compiled with hot/cold partitioning
    
    [ Upstream commit 8731acc5068eb3f422a45c760d32198175c756f8 ]
    
    gcc's -freorder-blocks-and-partition option makes it group frequently
    and infrequently used code in .text.hot and .text.unlikely sections
    respectively.  At least when building modules on s390, this option is
    used by default.
    
    gdb assumes that all code is located in .text section, and that .text
    section is located at module load address.  With such modules this is no
    longer the case: there is code in .text.hot and .text.unlikely, and
    either of them might precede .text.
    
    Fix by explicitly telling gdb the addresses of code sections.
    
    It might be tempting to do this for all sections, not only the ones in
    the white list.  Unfortunately, gdb appears to have an issue, when
    telling it about e.g. loadable .note.gnu.build-id section causes it to
    think that non-loadable .note.Linux section is loaded at address 0,
    which in turn causes NULL pointers to be resolved to bogus symbols.  So
    keep using the white list approach for the time being.
