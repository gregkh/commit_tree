    misc: panel: properly restore atomic counter on error path
    
    commit 93dc1774d2a4c7a298d5cdf78cc8acdcb7b1428d upstream.
    
    Commit f4757af ("staging: panel: Fix single-open policy race condition")
    introduced in 3.19-rc1 attempted to fix a race condition on the open, but
    failed to properly do it and used to exit without restoring the semaphore.
    
    This results in -EBUSY being returned after the first open error until
    the module is reloaded or the system restarted (ie: consecutive to a
    dual open resulting in -EBUSY or to a permission error).

    qla2xxx: Fix incorrect tcm_qla2xxx_free_cmd use during TMR ABORT (v2)
    
    commit 6bcbb3174caa5f1ccc894f8ae077631659d5a629 upstream.
    
    This patch drops two incorrect usages of tcm_qla2xxx_free_cmd()
    during TMR ABORT within tcm_qla2xxx_handle_data_work() and
    tcm_qla2xxx_aborted_task(), which where attempting to dispatch
    into workqueue context to do tcm_qla2xxx_complete_free() and
    subsequently invoke transport_generic_free_cmd().
    
    This is incorrect because during TMR ABORT target-core will
    drop the outstanding se_cmd->cmd_kref references once it has
    quiesced the se_cmd via transport_wait_for_tasks(), and in
    the case of qla2xxx it should not attempt to do it's own
    transport_generic_free_cmd() once the abort has occured.
    
    As reported by Pascal, this was originally manifesting as a
    BUG_ON(cmd->cmd_in_wq) in qlt_free_cmd() during TMR ABORT,
    with a LIO backend that had sufficently high enough WRITE
    latency to trigger a host side TMR ABORT_TASK.
    
    (v2: Drop the qla_tgt_cmd->write_pending_abort_comp changes,
         as they will be addressed in a seperate series)

    brcmfmac: remove setting IBSS mode when stopping AP
    
    commit 9029679f66d976f8c720eb03c4898274803c9923 upstream.
    
    Upon stopping an AP interface the driver disable INFRA mode effectively
    setting the interface in IBSS mode. However, this may affect other
    interfaces running in INFRA mode. For instance, if user creates and stops
    hostap daemon on virtual interface, then association cannot work on
    primary interface because default BSS has been set to IBSS mode in
    firmware side. The IBSS mode should be set when cfg80211 changes the
    interface.

    security/keys: add CONFIG_KEYS_COMPAT to Kconfig
    
    commit 47b2c3fff4932e6fc17ce13d51a43c6969714e20 upstream.
    
    CONFIG_KEYS_COMPAT is defined in arch-specific Kconfigs and is missing for
    several 64-bit architectures : mips, parisc, tile.
    
    At the moment and for those architectures, calling in 32-bit userspace the
    keyctl syscall would return an ENOSYS error.
    
    This patch moves the CONFIG_KEYS_COMPAT option to security/keys/Kconfig, to
    make sure the compatibility wrapper is registered by default for any 64-bit
    architecture as long as it is configured with CONFIG_COMPAT.

    netfilter: nat: Revert "netfilter: nat: convert nat bysrc hash to rhashtable"
    
    commit e1bf1687740ce1a3598a1c5e452b852ff2190682 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 870190a9ec9075205c0fa795a09fa931694a3ff1.
    
    It was not a good idea. The custom hash table was a much better
    fit for this purpose.
    
    A fast lookup is not essential, in fact for most cases there is no lookup
    at all because original tuple is not taken and can be used as-is.
    What needs to be fast is insertion and deletion.
    
    rhlist removal however requires a rhlist walk.
    We can have thousands of entries in such a list if source port/addresses
    are reused for multiple flows, if this happens removal requests are so
    expensive that deletions of a few thousand flows can take several
    seconds(!).
    
    The advantages that we got from rhashtable are:
    1) table auto-sizing
    2) multiple locks
    
    1) would be nice to have, but it is not essential as we have at
    most one lookup per new flow, so even a million flows in the bysource
    table are not a problem compared to current deletion cost.
    2) is easy to add to custom hash table.
    
    I tried to add hlist_node to rhlist to speed up rhltable_remove but this
    isn't doable without changing semantics.  rhltable_remove_fast will
    check that the to-be-deleted object is part of the table and that
    requires a list walk that we want to avoid.
    
    Furthermore, using hlist_node increases size of struct rhlist_head, which
    in turn increases nf_conn size.

    ALSA: seq: Cancel pending autoload work at unbinding device
    
    commit fc27fe7e8deef2f37cba3f2be2d52b6ca5eb9d57 upstream.
    
    ALSA sequencer core has a mechanism to load the enumerated devices
    automatically, and it's performed in an off-load work.  This seems

    autoload work is running.  As syzkaller spotted, it may lead to some

    mac80211: don't compare TKIP TX MIC key in reinstall prevention
    
    commit cfbb0d90a7abb289edc91833d0905931f8805f12 upstream.
    
    For the reinstall prevention, the code I had added compares the
    whole key. It turns out though that iwlwifi firmware doesn't
    provide the TKIP TX MIC key as it's not needed in client mode,
    and thus the comparison will always return false.
    
    For client mode, thus always zero out the TX MIC key part before
    doing the comparison in order to avoid accepting the reinstall
    of the key with identical encryption and RX MIC key, but not the
    same TX MIC key (since the supplicant provides the real one.)

    mac80211: accept key reinstall without changing anything
    
    commit fdf7cb4185b60c68e1a75e61691c4afdc15dea0e upstream.
    
    When a key is reinstalled we can reset the replay counters
    etc. which can lead to nonce reuse and/or replay detection
    being impossible, breaking security properties, as described
    in the "KRACK attacks".
    
    In particular, CVE-2017-13080 applies to GTK rekeying that
    happened in firmware while the host is in D3, with the second
    part of the attack being done after the host wakes up. In
    this case, the wpa_supplicant mitigation isn't sufficient
    since wpa_supplicant doesn't know the GTK material.
    
    In case this happens, simply silently accept the new key
    coming from userspace but don't take any action on it since
    it's the same key; this keeps the PN replay counters intact.

    ppp: fix race in ppp device destruction
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6151b8b37b119e8e3a8401b080d532520c95faf4 ]
    
    ppp_release() tries to ensure that netdevices are unregistered before
    decrementing the unit refcount and running ppp_destroy_interface().
    
    This is all fine as long as the the device is unregistered by
    ppp_release(): the unregister_netdevice() call, followed by
    rtnl_unlock(), guarantee that the unregistration process completes
    before rtnl_unlock() returns.
    
    However, the device may be unregistered by other means (like
    ppp_nl_dellink()). If this happens right before ppp_release() calling
    rtnl_lock(), then ppp_release() has to wait for the concurrent
    unregistration code to release the lock.
    But rtnl_unlock() releases the lock before completing the device
    unregistration process. This allows ppp_release() to proceed and
    eventually call ppp_destroy_interface() before the unregistration
    process completes. Calling free_netdev() on this partially unregistered
    device will BUG():

    We could set the ->needs_free_netdev flag on PPP devices and move the
    ppp_destroy_interface() logic in the ->priv_destructor() callback. But
    that'd be quite intrusive as we'd first need to unlink from the other
    channels and units that depend on the device (the ones that used the
    PPPIOCCONNECT and PPPIOCATTACH ioctls).
    
    Instead, we can just let the netdevice hold a reference on its
    ppp_file. This reference is dropped in ->priv_destructor(), at the very
    end of the unregistration process, so that neither ppp_release() nor
    ppp_disconnect_channel() can call ppp_destroy_interface() in the interim.

    net_sched: avoid matching qdisc with zero handle
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 50317fce2cc70a2bbbc4b42c31bbad510382a53c ]
    
    Davide found the following script triggers a NULL pointer
    dereference:
    
    ip l a name eth0 type dummy
    tc q a dev eth0 parent :1 handle 1: htb
    
    This is because for a freshly created netdevice noop_qdisc
    is attached and when passing 'parent :1', kernel actually
    tries to match the major handle which is 0 and noop_qdisc
    has handle 0 so is matched by mistake. Commit 69012ae425d7
    tries to fix a similar bug but still misses this case.
    
    Handle 0 is not a valid one, should be just skipped. In
    fact, kernel uses it as TC_H_UNSPEC.

    sctp: reset owner sk for data chunks on out queues when migrating a sock
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d04adf1b355181e737b6b1e23d801b07f0b7c4c0 ]
    
    Now when migrating sock to another one in sctp_sock_migrate(), it only
    resets owner sk for the data in receive queues, not the chunks on out
    queues.
    
    It would cause that data chunks length on the sock is not consistent
    with sk sk_wmem_alloc. When closing the sock or freeing these chunks,
    the old sk would never be freed, and the new sock may crash due to
    the overflow sk_wmem_alloc.
    
    syzbot found this issue with this series:
    
      r0 = socket$inet_sctp()
      sendto$inet(r0)
      listen(r0)
      accept4(r0)
      close(r0)
    
    Although listen() should have returned error when one TCP-style socket
    is in connecting (I may fix this one in another patch), it could also
    be reproduced by peeling off an assoc.
    
    This issue is there since very beginning.
    
    This patch is to reset owner sk for the chunks on out queues so that
    sk sk_wmem_alloc has correct value after accept one sock or peeloff
    an assoc to one sock.
    
    Note that when resetting owner sk for chunks on outqueue, it has to
    sctp_clear_owner_w/skb_orphan chunks before changing assoc->base.sk
    first and then sctp_set_owner_w them after changing assoc->base.sk,
    due to that sctp_wfree and it's callees are using assoc->base.sk.

    If the name argument of dev_get_valid_name() contains "%d", it will try

    relying this mechanism, therefor we should only consider negative values

    ip6_gre: update dst pmtu if dev mtu has been updated by toobig in __gre6_xmit
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 8aec4959d832bae0889a8e2f348973b5e4abffef ]
    
    When receiving a Toobig icmpv6 packet, ip6gre_err would just set
    tunnel dev's mtu, that's not enough. For skb_dst(skb)'s pmtu may
    still be using the old value, it has no chance to be updated with
    tunnel dev's mtu.
    
    Jianlin found this issue by reducing route's mtu while running
    netperf, the performance went to 0.
    
    ip6ip6 and ip4ip6 tunnel can work well with this, as they lookup
    the upper dst and update_pmtu it's pmtu or icmpv6_send a Toobig
    to upper socket after setting tunnel dev's mtu.
    
    We couldn't do that for ip6_gre, as gre's inner packet could be
    any protocol, it's difficult to handle them (like lookup upper
    dst) in a good way.
    
    So this patch is to fix it by updating skb_dst(skb)'s pmtu when
    dev->mtu < skb_dst(skb)'s pmtu in tx path. It's safe to do this
    update there, as usually dev->mtu <= skb_dst(skb)'s pmtu and no
    performance regression can be caused by this.

    ipip: only increase err_count for some certain type icmp in ipip_err
    
    
    [ Upstream commit f3594f0a7ea36661d7fd942facd7f31a64245f1a ]
    
    t->err_count is used to count the link failure on tunnel and an err
    will be reported to user socket in tx path if t->err_count is not 0.
    udp socket could even return EHOSTUNREACH to users.
    
    Since commit fd58156e456d ("IPIP: Use ip-tunneling code.") removed
    the 'switch check' for icmp type in ipip_err(), err_count would be
    increased by the icmp packet with ICMP_EXC_FRAGTIME code. an link
    failure would be reported out due to this.
    
    In Jianlin's case, when receiving ICMP_EXC_FRAGTIME a icmp packet,
    udp netperf failed with the err:
      send_data: data send error: No route to host (errno 113)
    
    We expect this error reported from tunnel to socket when receiving
    some certain type icmp, but not ICMP_EXC_FRAGTIME, ICMP_SR_FAILED
    or ICMP_PARAMETERPROB ones.
    
    This patch is to bring 'switch check' for icmp type back to ipip_err
    so that it only reports link failure for the right type icmp, just as
    in ipgre_err() and ipip6_err().

    tcp/dccp: fix other lockdep splats accessing ireq_opt

    In my first attempt to fix the lockdep splat, I forgot we could
    enter inet_csk_route_req() with a freshly allocated request socket,
    for which refcount has not yet been elevated, due to complex
    SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU rules.
    
    We either are in rcu_read_lock() section _or_ we own a refcount on the
    request.
    
    Correct RCU verb to use here is rcu_dereference_check(), although it is
    not possible to prove we actually own a reference on a shared
    refcount :/
    
    In v2, I added ireq_opt_deref() helper and use in three places, to fix other
    possible splats.

    sctp: full support for ipv6 ip_nonlocal_bind & IP_FREEBIND

    Commit 9b9742022888 ("sctp: support ipv6 nonlocal bind")
    introduced support for the above options as v4 sctp did,
    so patched sctp_v6_available().
    
    In the v4 implementation it's enough, because
    sctp_inet_bind_verify() just returns with sctp_v4_available().
    However sctp_inet6_bind_verify() has an extra check before that
    for link-local scope_id, which won't respect the above options.
    
    Added the checks before calling ipv6_chk_addr(), but
    not before the validation of scope_id.
    
    before (w/ both options):
     ./v6test fe80::10 sctp
     bind failed, errno: 99 (Cannot assign requested address)
     ./v6test fe80::10 tcp
     bind success, errno: 0 (Success)
    
    after (w/ both options):

    ipv6: flowlabel: do not leave opt->tot_len with garbage
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 864e2a1f8aac05effac6063ce316b480facb46ff ]
    
    When syzkaller team brought us a C repro for the crash [1] that
    had been reported many times in the past, I finally could find
    the root cause.
    
    If FlowLabel info is merged by fl6_merge_options(), we leave
    part of the opt_space storage provided by udp/raw/l2tp with random value
    in opt_space.tot_len, unless a control message was provided at sendmsg()
    time.
    
    Then ip6_setup_cork() would use this random value to perform a kzalloc()
    call. Undefined behavior and crashes.
    
    Fix is to properly set tot_len in fl6_merge_options()
    
    At the same time, we can also avoid consuming memory and cpu cycles
    to clear it, if every option is copied via a kmemdup(). This is the
    change in ip6_setup_cork().

    soreuseport: fix initialization race
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1b5f962e71bfad6284574655c406597535c3ea7a ]
    
    Syzkaller stumbled upon a way to trigger
    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 13881 at net/core/sock_reuseport.c:41
    reuseport_alloc+0x306/0x3b0 net/core/sock_reuseport.c:39
    
    There are two initialization paths for the sock_reuseport structure in a
    socket: Through the udp/tcp bind paths of SO_REUSEPORT sockets or through
    SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_[CE]BPF before bind.  The existing implementation
    assumedthat the socket lock protected both of these paths when it actually
    only protects the SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT path.  Syzkaller triggered this
    double allocation by running these paths concurrently.
    
    This patch moves the check for double allocation into the reuseport_alloc
    function which is protected by a global spin lock.

    packet: avoid panic in packet_getsockopt()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 509c7a1ecc8601f94ffba8a00889fefb239c00c6 ]
    
    syzkaller got crashes in packet_getsockopt() processing
    PACKET_ROLLOVER_STATS command while another thread was managing
    to change po->rollover
    
    Using RCU will fix this bug. We might later add proper RCU annotations
    for sparse sake.
    
    In v2: I replaced kfree(rollover) in fanout_add() to kfree_rcu()
    variant, as spotted by John.

    tcp/dccp: fix ireq->opt races
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c92e8c02fe664155ac4234516e32544bec0f113d ]
    
    syzkaller found another bug in DCCP/TCP stacks [1]
    
    For the reasons explained in commit ce1050089c96 ("tcp/dccp: fix
    ireq->pktopts race"), we need to make sure we do not access
    ireq->opt unless we own the request sock.
    
    Note the opt field is renamed to ireq_opt to ease grep games.

    sctp: add the missing sock_owned_by_user check in sctp_icmp_redirect
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1cc276cec9ec574d41cf47dfc0f51406b6f26ab4 ]
    
    Now sctp processes icmp redirect packet in sctp_icmp_redirect where
    it calls sctp_transport_dst_check in which tp->dst can be released.
    
    The problem is before calling sctp_transport_dst_check, it doesn't
    check sock_owned_by_user, which means tp->dst could be freed while
    a process is accessing it with owning the socket.
    
    An use-after-free issue could be triggered by this.
    
    This patch is to fix it by checking sock_owned_by_user before calling
    sctp_transport_dst_check in sctp_icmp_redirect, so that it would not
    release tp->dst if users still hold sock lock.
    
    Besides, the same issue fixed in commit 45caeaa5ac0b ("dccp/tcp: fix
    routing redirect race") on sctp also needs this check.
    
    Fixes: 55be7a9c6074 ("ipv4: Add redirect support to all protocol icmp error handlers")

    tun: call dev_get_valid_name() before register_netdevice()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ad646c81b2182f7fa67ec0c8c825e0ee165696d ]
    
    register_netdevice() could fail early when we have an invalid
    dev name, in which case ->ndo_uninit() is not called. For tun
    device, this is a problem because a timer etc. are already
    initialized and it expects ->ndo_uninit() to clean them up.
    
    We could move these initializations into a ->ndo_init() so
    that register_netdevice() knows better, however this is still
    complicated due to the logic in tun_detach().
    
    Therefore, I choose to just call dev_get_valid_name() before
    register_netdevice(), which is quicker and much easier to audit.
    And for this specific case, it is already enough.

    l2tp: check ps->sock before running pppol2tp_session_ioctl()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5903f594935a3841137c86b9d5b75143a5b7121c ]
    
    When pppol2tp_session_ioctl() is called by pppol2tp_tunnel_ioctl(),
    the session may be unconnected. That is, it was created by
    pppol2tp_session_create() and hasn't been connected with
    pppol2tp_connect(). In this case, ps->sock is NULL, so we need to check
    for this case in order to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer.

    tcp: fix tcp_mtu_probe() vs highest_sack
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b7cda9c35d3b940eb9ce74b30bbd5eb30db493d ]
    
    Based on SNMP values provided by Roman, Yuchung made the observation
    that some crashes in tcp_sacktag_walk() might be caused by MTU probing.
    
    Looking at tcp_mtu_probe(), I found that when a new skb was placed
    in front of the write queue, we were not updating tcp highest sack.
    
    If one skb is freed because all its content was copied to the new skb
    (for MTU probing), then tp->highest_sack could point to a now freed skb.
    
    Bad things would then happen, including infinite loops.
    
    This patch renames tcp_highest_sack_combine() and uses it
    from tcp_mtu_probe() to fix the bug.
    
    Note that I also removed one test against tp->sacked_out,
    since we want to replace tp->highest_sack regardless of whatever
    condition, since keeping a stale pointer to freed skb is a recipe
    for disaster.

    If for some reason, the newly allocated child need to be freed,
    we will call cgroup_put() (via sk_free_unlock_clone()) while the
    corresponding cgroup_get() was not yet done, and we will free memory
    too soon.

    netlink: do not set cb_running if dump's start() errs
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 41c87425a1ac9b633e0fcc78eb1f19640c8fb5a0 ]
    
    It turns out that multiple places can call netlink_dump(), which means
    it's still possible to dereference partially initialized values in
    dump() that were the result of a faulty returned start().
    
    This fixes the issue by calling start() _before_ setting cb_running to
    true, so that there's no chance at all of hitting the dump() function
    through any indirect paths.
    
    It also moves the call to start() to be when the mutex is held. This has
    the nice side effect of serializing invocations to start(), which is
    likely desirable anyway. It also prevents any possible other races that
    might come out of this logic.
    
    In testing this with several different pieces of tricky code to trigger
    these issues, this commit fixes all avenues that I'm aware of.

    gso: fix payload length when gso_size is zero

    When gso_size reset to zero for the tail segment in skb_segment(), later
    in ipv6_gso_segment(), __skb_udp_tunnel_segment() and gre_gso_segment()
    we will get incorrect results (payload length, pcsum) for that segment.
    inet_gso_segment() already has a check for gso_size before calculating
    payload.
    
    The issue was found with LTP vxlan & gre tests over ixgbe NIC.
