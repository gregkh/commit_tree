    mm: fix new crash in unmapped_area_topdown()
    
    commit f4cb767d76cf7ee72f97dd76f6cfa6c76a5edc89 upstream.
    
    Trinity gets kernel BUG at mm/mmap.c:1963! in about 3 minutes of
    mmap testing.  That's the VM_BUG_ON(gap_end < gap_start) at the
    end of unmapped_area_topdown().  Linus points out how MAP_FIXED
    (which does not have to respect our stack guard gap intentions)
    could result in gap_end below gap_start there.  Fix that, and
    the similar case in its alternative, unmapped_area().

    mm: larger stack guard gap, between vmas
    
    commit 1be7107fbe18eed3e319a6c3e83c78254b693acb upstream.
    
    Stack guard page is a useful feature to reduce a risk of stack smashing
    into a different mapping. We have been using a single page gap which
    is sufficient to prevent having stack adjacent to a different mapping.
    But this seems to be insufficient in the light of the stack usage in
    userspace. E.g. glibc uses as large as 64kB alloca() in many commonly
    used functions. Others use constructs liks gid_t buffer[NGROUPS_MAX]
    which is 256kB or stack strings with MAX_ARG_STRLEN.
    
    This will become especially dangerous for suid binaries and the default
    no limit for the stack size limit because those applications can be
    tricked to consume a large portion of the stack and a single glibc call
    could jump over the guard page. These attacks are not theoretical,
    unfortunatelly.
    
    Make those attacks less probable by increasing the stack guard gap
    to 1MB (on systems with 4k pages; but make it depend on the page size
    because systems with larger base pages might cap stack allocations in
    the PAGE_SIZE units) which should cover larger alloca() and VLA stack
    allocations. It is obviously not a full fix because the problem is
    somehow inherent, but it should reduce attack space a lot.
    
    One could argue that the gap size should be configurable from userspace,
    but that can be done later when somebody finds that the new 1MB is wrong
    for some special case applications.  For now, add a kernel command line
    option (stack_guard_gap) to specify the stack gap size (in page units).
    
    Implementation wise, first delete all the old code for stack guard page:
    because although we could get away with accounting one extra page in a
    stack vma, accounting a larger gap can break userspace - case in point,
    a program run with "ulimit -S -v 20000" failed when the 1MB gap was
    counted for RLIMIT_AS; similar problems could come with RLIMIT_MLOCK
    and strict non-overcommit mode.
    
    Instead of keeping gap inside the stack vma, maintain the stack guard
    gap as a gap between vmas: using vm_start_gap() in place of vm_start
    (or vm_end_gap() in place of vm_end if VM_GROWSUP) in just those few
    places which need to respect the gap - mainly arch_get_unmapped_area(),
    and and the vma tree's subtree_gap support for that.

    alarmtimer: Rate limit periodic intervals
    
    commit ff86bf0c65f14346bf2440534f9ba5ac232c39a0 upstream.
    
    The alarmtimer code has another source of potentially rearming itself too
    fast. Interval timers with a very samll interval have a similar CPU hog
    effect as the previously fixed overflow issue.
    
    The reason is that alarmtimers do not implement the normal protection
    against this kind of problem which the other posix timer use:
    
      timer expires -> queue signal -> deliver signal -> rearm timer
    
    This scheme brings the rearming under scheduler control and prevents
    permanently firing timers which hog the CPU.
    
    Bringing this scheme to the alarm timer code is a major overhaul because it
    lacks all the necessary mechanisms completely.
    
    So for a quick fix limit the interval to one jiffie. This is not
    problematic in practice as alarmtimers are usually backed by an RTC for
    suspend which have 1 second resolution. It could be therefor argued that
    the resolution of this clock should be set to 1 second in general, but
    that's outside the scope of this fix.

    mm/memory-failure.c: use compound_head() flags for huge pages
    
    commit 7258ae5c5a2ce2f5969e8b18b881be40ab55433d upstream.
    
    memory_failure() chooses a recovery action function based on the page
    flags.  For huge pages it uses the tail page flags which don't have
    anything interesting set, resulting in:
    
    > Memory failure: 0x9be3b4: Unknown page state
    > Memory failure: 0x9be3b4: recovery action for unknown page: Failed
    
    Instead, save a copy of the head page's flags if this is a huge page,
    this means if there are no relevant flags for this tail page, we use the
    head pages flags instead.  This results in the me_huge_page() recovery
    action being called:
    
    > Memory failure: 0x9b7969: recovery action for huge page: Delayed
    
    For hugepages that have not yet been allocated, this allows the hugepage
    to be dequeued.

    pvrusb2: reduce stack usage pvr2_eeprom_analyze()
    
    commit 6830733d53a4517588e56227b9c8538633f0c496 upstream.
    
    The driver uses a relatively large data structure on the stack, which
    showed up on my radar as we get a warning with the "latent entropy"
    GCC plugin:
    
    drivers/media/usb/pvrusb2/pvrusb2-eeprom.c:153:1: error: the frame size of 1376 bytes is larger than 1152 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
    
    The warning is usually hidden as we raise the warning limit to 2048
    when the plugin is enabled, but I'd like to lower that again in the
    future, and making this function smaller helps to do that without
    build regressions.
    
    Further analysis shows that putting an 'i2c_client' structure on
    the stack is not really supported, as the embedded 'struct device'
    is not initialized here, and we are only saved by the fact that
    the function that is called here does not use the pointer at all.

    commit 8b8a84c54aff4256d592dc18346c65ecf6811b45 upstream.
    
    Commit 16fa3dc75c22 ("mfd: omap-usb-tll: HOST TLL platform driver")
    added support for USB TLL, but uses OMAP_TLL_CHANNEL_CONF_ULPINOBITSTUFF
    bit the wrong way. The comments in the code are correct, but the inverted
    use of OMAP_TLL_CHANNEL_CONF_ULPINOBITSTUFF causes the register to be
    enabled instead of disabled unlike what the comments say.
    
    Without this change the Wrigley 3G LTE modem on droid 4 EHCI bus can
    be only pinged few times before it stops responding.

    x86/mm/32: Set the '__vmalloc_start_set' flag in initmem_init()
    
    commit 861ce4a3244c21b0af64f880d5bfe5e6e2fb9e4a upstream.
    
    '__vmalloc_start_set' currently only gets set in initmem_init() when
    !CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES. This breaks detection of vmalloc address
    with virt_addr_valid() with CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=y, causing
    a kernel crash:

    commit b8e11f7d2791bd9320be1c6e772a60b2aa093e45 upstream.
    
    Commit 27ed3cd2ebf4 (cpufreq: conservative: Fix the logic in frequency
    decrease checking) removed the 10 point substraction when comparing the
    load against down_threshold but did not remove the related limit for the
    down_threshold value.  As a result, down_threshold lower than 11 is not
    allowed even though values from 1 to 10 do work correctly too. The
    comment ("cannot be lower than 11 otherwise freq will not fall") also
    does not apply after removing the substraction.
    
    For this reason, allow down_threshold to take any value from 1 to 99
    and fix the related comment.

    configfs: Fix race between create_link and configfs_rmdir
    
    commit ba80aa909c99802c428682c352b0ee0baac0acd3 upstream.
    
    This patch closes a long standing race in configfs between
    the creation of a new symlink in create_link(), while the
    symlink target's config_item is being concurrently removed
    via configfs_rmdir().
    
    This can happen because the symlink target's reference
    is obtained by config_item_get() in create_link() before
    the CONFIGFS_USET_DROPPING bit set by configfs_detach_prep()
    during configfs_rmdir() shutdown is actually checked..
    
    This originally manifested itself on ppc64 on v4.8.y under
    heavy load using ibmvscsi target ports with Novalink API:

    log2: make order_base_2() behave correctly on const input value zero
    
    commit 29905b52fad0854351f57bab867647e4982285bf upstream.
    
    The function order_base_2() is defined (according to the comment block)
    as returning zero on input zero, but subsequently passes the input into
    roundup_pow_of_two(), which is explicitly undefined for input zero.
    
    This has gone unnoticed until now, but optimization passes in GCC 7 may
    produce constant folded function instances where a constant value of
    zero is passed into order_base_2(), resulting in link errors against the
    deliberately undefined '____ilog2_NaN'.
    
    So update order_base_2() to adhere to its own documented interface.
    
    [ See
    
         http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=147672952517795&w=2
    
      and follow-up discussion for more background. The gcc "optimization
      pass" is really just broken, but now the GCC trunk problem seems to
      have escaped out of just specially built daily images, so we need to
      work around it in mainline.    - Linus ]

    ipv6: Handle IPv4-mapped src to in6addr_any dst.
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 052d2369d1b479cdbbe020fdd6d057d3c342db74 ]
    
    This patch adds a check on the type of the source address for the case
    where the destination address is in6addr_any. If the source is an
    IPv4-mapped IPv6 source address, the destination is changed to
    ::ffff:127.0.0.1, and otherwise the destination is changed to ::1. This
    is done in three locations to handle UDP calls to either connect() or
    sendmsg() and TCP calls to connect(). Note that udpv6_sendmsg() delays
    handling an in6addr_any destination until very late, so the patch only
    needs to handle the case where the source is an IPv4-mapped IPv6
    address.

    net: xilinx_emaclite: fix freezes due to unordered I/O
    
    
    [ Upstream commit acf138f1b00bdd1b7cd9894562ed0c2a1670888e ]
    
    The xilinx_emaclite uses __raw_writel and __raw_readl for register
    accesses. Those functions do not imply any kind of memory barriers and
    they may be reordered.
    
    The driver does not seem to take that into account, though, and the
    driver does not satisfy the ordering requirements of the hardware.
    For clear examples, see xemaclite_mdio_write() and xemaclite_mdio_read()
    which try to set MDIO address before initiating the transaction.
    
    I'm seeing system freezes with the driver with GCC 5.4 and current
    Linux kernels on Zynq-7000 SoC immediately when trying to use the
    interface.
    
    In commit 123c1407af87 ("net: emaclite: Do not use microblaze and ppc
    IO functions") the driver was switched from non-generic
    in_be32/out_be32 (memory barriers, big endian) to
    __raw_readl/__raw_writel (no memory barriers, native endian), so
    apparently the device follows system endianness and the driver was
    originally written with the assumption of memory barriers.
    
    Rather than try to hunt for each case of missing barrier, just switch

    Call echo service immediately after socket reconnect
    
    commit b8c600120fc87d53642476f48c8055b38d6e14c7 upstream.
    
    Commit 4fcd1813e640 ("Fix reconnect to not defer smb3 session reconnect
    long after socket reconnect") changes the behaviour of the SMB2 echo
    service and causes it to renegotiate after a socket reconnect. However
    under default settings, the echo service could take up to 120 seconds to
    be scheduled.
    
    The patch forces the echo service to be called immediately resulting a
    negotiate call being made immediately on reconnect.

    partitions/msdos: FreeBSD UFS2 file systems are not recognized
    
    commit 223220356d5ebc05ead9a8d697abb0c0a906fc81 upstream.
    
    The code in block/partitions/msdos.c recognizes FreeBSD, OpenBSD
    and NetBSD partitions and does a reasonable job picking out OpenBSD
    and NetBSD UFS subpartitions.
    
    But for FreeBSD the subpartitions are always "bad".
    
        Kernel: <bsd:bad subpartition - ignored
    
    Though all 3 of these BSD systems use UFS as a file system, only
    FreeBSD uses relative start addresses in the subpartition
    declarations.
    
    The following patch fixes this for FreeBSD partitions and leaves
    the code for OpenBSD and NetBSD intact:

    s390/vmem: fix identity mapping
    
    commit c34a69059d7876e0793eb410deedfb08ccb22b02 upstream.
    
    The identity mapping is suboptimal for the last 2GB frame. The mapping
    will be established with a mix of 4KB and 1MB mappings instead of a
    single 2GB mapping.
    
    This happens because of a off-by-one bug introduced with
    commit 50be63450728 ("s390/mm: Convert bootmem to memblock").
    
    Currently the identity mapping looks like this:
    
    0x0000000080000000-0x0000000180000000        4G PUD RW
    0x0000000180000000-0x00000001fff00000     2047M PMD RW
    0x00000001fff00000-0x0000000200000000        1M PTE RW
    
    With the bug fixed it looks like this:
    
    0x0000000080000000-0x0000000200000000        6G PUD RW
