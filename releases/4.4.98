    PKCS#7: fix unitialized boolean 'want'
    
    commit 06aae592425701851e02bb850cb9f4997f0ae163 upstream.
    
    The boolean want is not initialized and hence garbage. The default should
    be false (later it is only set to true on tne sinfo->authattrs check).

    With Wayland desktop and atomic mode set, during the mode setting

    are being pinned.  This was not an issue with Xorg.
    
    Since this only happens during a mode change, there should be no

    MIPS: SMP: Fix deadlock & online race
    
    commit 9e8c399a88f0b87e41a894911475ed2a8f8dff9e upstream.
    
    Commit 6f542ebeaee0 ("MIPS: Fix race on setting and getting
    cpu_online_mask") effectively reverted commit 8f46cca1e6c06 ("MIPS: SMP:
    Fix possibility of deadlock when bringing CPUs online") and thus has
    reinstated the possibility of deadlock.
    
    The commit was based on testing of kernel v4.4, where the CPU hotplug
    core code issued a BUG() if the starting CPU is not marked online when
    the boot CPU returns from __cpu_up. The commit fixes this race (in
    v4.4), but re-introduces the deadlock situation.
    
    As noted in the commit message, upstream differs in this area. Commit
    8df3e07e7f21f ("cpu/hotplug: Let upcoming cpu bring itself fully up")
    adds a completion event in the CPU hotplug core code, making this race
    impossible. However, people were unhappy with relying on the core code
    to do the right thing.
    
    To address the issues both commits were trying to fix, add a second
    completion event in the MIPS smp hotplug path. It removes the
    possibility of a race, since the MIPS smp hotplug code now synchronises
    both the boot and secondary CPUs before they return to the hotplug core
    code. It also addresses the deadlock by ensuring that the secondary CPU
    is not marked online before it's counters are synchronised.
    
    This fix should also be backported to fix the race condition introduced
    by the backport of commit 8f46cca1e6c06 ("MIPS: SMP: Fix possibility of
    deadlock when bringing CPUs online"), through really that race only
    existed before commit 8df3e07e7f21f ("cpu/hotplug: Let upcoming cpu
    bring itself fully up").

    MIPS: Fix race on setting and getting cpu_online_mask
    
    commit 6f542ebeaee0ee552a902ce3892220fc22c7ec8e upstream.
    
    While testing cpu hoptlug (cpu down and up in loops) on kernel 4.4, it was
    observed that occasionally check for cpu online will fail in kernel/cpu.c,
    _cpu_up:
    
    https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/tree/kernel/cpu.c?h=v4.4.79#n485
     518        /* Arch-specific enabling code. */
     519        ret = __cpu_up(cpu, idle);
     520
     521        if (ret != 0)
     522                goto out_notify;
     523        BUG_ON(!cpu_online(cpu));
    
    Reason is race between start_secondary and _cpu_up. cpu_callin_map is set
    before cpu_online_mask. In __cpu_up, cpu_callin_map is waited for, but cpu
    online mask is not, resulting in race in which secondary processor started
    and set cpu_callin_map, but not yet set the online mask,resulting in above
    BUG being hit.
    
    Upstream differs in the area. cpu_online check is in bringup_wait_for_ap,
    which is after cpu reached AP_ONLINE_IDLE,where secondary passed its start
    function. Nonetheless, fix makes start_secondary safe and not depending on
    other locks throughout the code. It protects as well against cpu_online
    checks put in between sometimes in the future.
    
    Fix this by moving completion after all flags are set.

    MIPS: SMP: Use a completion event to signal CPU up
    
    commit a00eeede507c975087b7b8df8cf2c9f88ba285de upstream.
    
    If a secondary CPU failed to start, for any reason, the CPU requesting
    the secondary to start would get stuck in the loop waiting for the
    secondary to be present in the cpu_callin_map.
    
    Rather than that, use a completion event to signal that the secondary
    CPU has started and is waiting to synchronise counters.
    
    Since the CPU presence will no longer be marked in cpu_callin_map,
    remove the redundant test from arch_cpu_idle_dead().

    MIPS: Fix CM region target definitions
    
    commit 6a6cba1d945a7511cdfaf338526871195e420762 upstream.
    
    The default CM target field in the GCR_BASE register is encoded with 0
    meaning memory & 1 being reserved. However the definitions we use for
    those bits effectively get these two values backwards - likely because
    they were copied from the definitions for the CM regions where the
    target is encoded differently. This results in use setting up GCR_BASE
    with the reserved target value by default, rather than targeting memory

    great idea to rely upon.
    
    Fix this by changing our macros to match the documentated target values.
    
    The incorrect encoding became used as of commit 9f98f3dd0c51 ("MIPS: Add
    generic CM probe & access code") in the Linux v3.15 cycle, and was
    likely carried forwards from older but unused code introduced by
    commit 39b8d5254246 ("[MIPS] Add support for MIPS CMP platform.") in the
    v2.6.26 cycle.

    commit 77238e76b9156d28d86c1e31c00ed2960df0e4de upstream.
    
    It seems that this is a typo error and the proper bit masking is
    "RT | RS" instead of "RS | RS".
    
    This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.

    ALSA: seq: Avoid invalid lockdep class warning
    
    commit 3510c7aa069aa83a2de6dab2b41401a198317bdc upstream.
    
    The recent fix for adding rwsem nesting annotation was using the given
    "hop" argument as the lock subclass key.  Although the idea itself
    works, it may trigger a kernel warning like:
      BUG: looking up invalid subclass: 8
      ....
    since the lockdep has a smaller number of subclasses (8) than we
    currently allow for the hops there (10).
    
    The current definition is merely a sanity check for avoiding the too
    deep delivery paths, and the 8 hops are already enough.  So, as a
    quick fix, just follow the max hops as same as the max lockdep
    subclasses.

    ALSA: seq: Fix OSS sysex delivery in OSS emulation
    
    commit 132d358b183ac6ad8b3fea32ad5e0663456d18d1 upstream.
    
    The SYSEX event delivery in OSS sequencer emulation assumed that the
    event is encoded in the variable-length data with the straight
    buffering.  This was the normal behavior in the past, but during the
    development, the chained buffers were introduced for carrying more
    data, while the OSS code was left intact.  As a result, when a SYSEX
    event with the chained buffer data is passed to OSS sequencer port,
    it may end up with the wrong memory access, as if it were having a too
    large buffer.
    
    This patch addresses the bug, by applying the buffer data expansion by
    the generic snd_seq_dump_var_event() helper function.

    ARM: 8720/1: ensure dump_instr() checks addr_limit
    
    commit b9dd05c7002ee0ca8b676428b2268c26399b5e31 upstream.
    
    When CONFIG_DEBUG_USER is enabled, it's possible for a user to
    deliberately trigger dump_instr() with a chosen kernel address.
    
    Let's avoid problems resulting from this by using get_user() rather than
    __get_user(), ensuring that we don't erroneously access kernel memory.
    
    So that we can use the same code to dump user instructions and kernel
    instructions, the common dumping code is factored out to __dump_instr(),
    with the fs manipulated appropriately in dump_instr() around calls to
    this.

    KEYS: fix NULL pointer dereference during ASN.1 parsing [ver #2]
    
    commit 624f5ab8720b3371367327a822c267699c1823b8 upstream.
    
    syzkaller reported a NULL pointer dereference in asn1_ber_decoder().  It
    can be reproduced by the following command, assuming
    CONFIG_PKCS7_TEST_KEY=y:
    
            keyctl add pkcs7_test desc '' @s
    
    The bug is that if the data buffer is empty, an integer underflow occurs
    in the following check:
    
            if (unlikely(dp >= datalen - 1))
                    goto data_overrun_error;
    
    This results in the NULL data pointer being dereferenced.
    
    Fix it by checking for 'datalen - dp < 2' instead.
    
    Also fix the similar check for 'dp >= datalen - n' later in the same
    function.  That one possibly could result in a buffer overread.
    
    The NULL pointer dereference was reproducible using the "pkcs7_test" key
    type but not the "asymmetric" key type because the "asymmetric" key type
    checks for a 0-length payload before calling into the ASN.1 decoder but
    the "pkcs7_test" key type does not.
    
    The bug report was:
    
        BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at           (null)

    struct sha1_ctx_mgr allocated in sha1_mb_mod_init() via kzalloc()

    16-bytes aligned argument, but nothing guarantees that struct
    sha1_ctx_mgr will have that alignment. Unaligned vmovdqa will
    generate GP fault.
    
    Fix this by replacing vmovdqa with vmovdqu which doesn't have alignment
    requirements.

    workqueue: Fix NULL pointer dereference

    When queue_work() is used in irq (not in task context), there is
    a potential case that trigger NULL pointer dereference.
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    worker_thread()
    |-spin_lock_irq()
    |-process_one_work()
            |-worker->current_pwq = pwq

            |-spin_lock_irq()
            |-worker->current_pwq = NULL
    |-spin_unlock_irq()
    
                                    //interrupt here
                                    |-irq_handler
                                            |-__queue_work()
                                                    //assuming that the wq is draining
                                                    |-is_chained_work(wq)
                                                            |-current_wq_worker()
                                                            //Here, 'current' is the interrupted worker!
                                                                    |-current->current_pwq is NULL here!
    |-schedule()
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Avoid it by checking for task context in current_wq_worker(), and
    if not in task context, we shouldn't use the 'current' to check the
    condition.

    KEYS: trusted: fix writing past end of buffer in trusted_read()
    
    commit a3c812f7cfd80cf51e8f5b7034f7418f6beb56c1 upstream.
    
    When calling keyctl_read() on a key of type "trusted", if the
    user-supplied buffer was too small, the kernel ignored the buffer length
    and just wrote past the end of the buffer, potentially corrupting
    userspace memory.  Fix it by instead returning the size required, as per
    the documentation for keyctl_read().
    
    We also don't even fill the buffer at all in this case, as this is
    slightly easier to implement than doing a short read, and either
    behavior appears to be permitted.  It also makes it match the behavior
    of the "encrypted" key type.

    cdc_ncm: Set NTB format again after altsetting switch for Huawei devices
    
    commit 2b02c20ce0c28974b44e69a2e2f5ddc6a470ad6f upstream.
    
    Some firmwares in Huawei E3372H devices have been observed to switch back
    to NTB 32-bit format after altsetting switch.
    This patch implements a driver flag to check for the device settings and
    set NTB format to 16-bit again if needed.
    The flag has been activated for devices controlled by the huawei_cdc_ncm.c
    driver.
    
    V1->V2:
    - fixed broken error checks
    - some corrections to the commit message
    V2->V3:
    - variable name changes, to clarify what's happening
    - check (and possibly set) the NTB format later in the common bind code path

    platform/x86: hp-wmi: Fix detection for dock and tablet mode
    
    commit 298747b7579f5bbbced793d997b333fd10a24921 upstream.
    
    The current driver code is not checking for the error values returned by
    'hp_wmi_dock_state()' and 'hp_wmi_tablet_state()' before passing the
    returned values down to 'input_report_switch()'. This error code is
    being translated to '1' in the input subsystem, reporting the wrong
    status.
    
    The biggest problem caused by this issue is that several laptops are
    wrongly reported by the driver as docked, preventing them to be put to
    sleep using the LID (and in most cases they are not even dockable).
    
    With this patch we create the report switches only if we are able to
    read the dock and tablet mode status correctly from ACPI.

    IB/ipoib: Change list_del to list_del_init in the tx object
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 27d41d29c7f093f6f77843624fbb080c1b4a8b9c ]
    
    Since ipoib_cm_tx_start function and ipoib_cm_tx_reap function
    belong to different work queues, they can run in parallel.
    In this case if ipoib_cm_tx_reap calls list_del and release the
    lock, ipoib_cm_tx_start may acquire it and call list_del_init
    on the already deleted object.
    Changing list_del to list_del_init in ipoib_cm_tx_reap fixes the problem.

    [ Upstream commit 08fea55e37f58371bffc5336a59e55d1f155955a ]
    
    This driver reports input events on their interrupts which are triggered
    by the sensor's status register changes.  But only single bit change is
    reported in the interrupt handler.  So if there are multiple bits are
    changed at almost the same time, other press or release events are ignored.
    
    This fixes it by detecting all changed bits in the status register.

    [ Upstream commit ebd89a2d0675f1325c2be5b7576fd8cb7e8defd0 ]
    
    ah4 input processing uses the asynchronous hash crypto API which
    supplies an error code as part of the operation completion but
    the error code was being ignored.
    
    Treat a crypto API error indication as a verification failure.
    
    While a crypto API reported error would almost certainly result
    in a memcpy of the digest failing anyway and thus the security
    risk seems minor, performing a memory compare on what might be
    uninitialized memory is wrong.

    iio: trigger: free trigger resource correctly
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 10e840dfb0b7fc345082dd9e5fff3c1c02e7690e ]
    
    These stand-alone trigger drivers were using iio_trigger_put()
    where they should have been using iio_trigger_free().  The
    iio_trigger_put() adds a module_put which is bad since they
    never did a module_get.
    
    In the sysfs driver, module_get/put's are used as triggers are
    added & removed. This extra module_put() occurs on an error path
    in the probe routine (probably rare).
    
    In the bfin-timer & interrupt trigger drivers, the module resources
    are not explicitly managed, so it's doing a put on something that
    was never get'd.  It occurs on the probe error path and on the
    remove path (not so rare).
    
    Tested with the sysfs trigger driver.
    The bfin & interrupt drivers were build tested & inspected only.

    To prevent corruption of the stage-1 context pointer field when
    updating STEs, rebuild the entire containing dword instead of
    clearing individual fields.

    KVM: PPC: Book 3S: XICS: correct the real mode ICP rejecting counter
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 37451bc95dee0e666927d6ffdda302dbbaaae6fa ]
    
    Some counters are added in Commit 6e0365b78273 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV:
    Add ICP real mode counters"), to provide some performance statistics to
    determine whether further optimizing is needed for real mode functions.
    
    The n_reject counter counts how many times ICP rejects an irq because of
    priority in real mode. The redelivery of an lsi that is still asserted
    after eoi doesn't fall into this category, so the increasement there is
    removed.
    
    Also, it needs to be increased in icp_rm_deliver_irq() if it rejects
    another one.

    xen/netback: set default upper limit of tx/rx queues to 8
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 56dd5af9bc23d0d5d23bb207c477715b4c2216c5 ]
    
    The default for the maximum number of tx/rx queues of one interface is
    the number of cpus of the system today. As each queue pair reserves 512
    grant pages this default consumes a ridiculous number of grants for
    large guests.
    
    Limit the queue number to 8 as default. This value can be modified
    via a module parameter if required.

    PCI: mvebu: Handle changes to the bridge windows while enabled
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d9bf28e2650fe3eeefed7e34841aea07d10c6543 ]
    
    The PCI core will write to the bridge window config multiple times while
    they are enabled.  This can lead to mbus failures like this:
    
     mvebu_mbus: cannot add window '4:e8', conflicts with another window
     mvebu-pcie mbus:pex@e0000000: Could not create MBus window at [mem 0xe0000000-0xe00fffff]: -22
    
    For me this is happening during a hotplug cycle.  The PCI core is not
    changing the values, just writing them twice while active.
    
    The patch addresses the general case of any change to an active window, but
    not atomically.  The code is slightly refactored so io and mem can share
    more of the window logic.

    video: fbdev: pmag-ba-fb: Remove bad `__init' annotation
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 879e5a0df626f39cbb3c61bb90373e56d67012c4 ]
    
    Fix:
    
    WARNING: drivers/video/fbdev/pmag-ba-fb.o(.text+0x308): Section mismatch in reference from the function pmagbafb_probe() to the function .init.text:pmagbafb_erase_cursor()
    The function pmagbafb_probe()
    references the function __init pmagbafb_erase_cursor().
    This is often because pmagbafb_probe lacks a __init
    annotation or the annotation of pmagbafb_erase_cursor is wrong.
    
    -- a fallout from a missed update from commit 9625b51350cc ("VIDEO:
    PMAG-BA: Fix section mismatch") and then commit 48c68c4f1b54 ("Drivers:

    adv7604: Initialize drive strength to default when using DT
    
    
    [ Upstream commit da8892d410db224d9a24104529794e6e37e0c100 ]
    
    The adv7604 driver platform data contains fields for configuring the drive
    strength of the output pins. When probing the driver through DT these
    fields are not explicitly initialized, which means they are left at 0. This
    is a reserved setting for the drive strength configuration though and can
    cause signal integrity issues.
    
    Whether these signal integrity issues are visible depends on the PCB
    specifics (e.g. the higher the load capacitance for the output the more
    visible the issue). But it has been observed on existing solutions at high
    pixel clock rates.
    
    Initialize the drive strength settings to the power-on-reset value of the
    device when probing through devicetree to avoid this issue.
