    net: bridge: fix error in br_multicast_add_port when CONFIG_NET_SWITCHDEV=n
    
    commit 68f5c12abbc9b6f8c5eea16c62f8b7be70793163 upstream.
    
    When CONFIG_NET_SWITCHDEV is disabled, the shim for switchdev_port_attr_set
    inside br_mc_disabled_update returns -EOPNOTSUPP. This is not caught,
    and propagated to the caller of br_multicast_add_port, preventing ports
    from joining the bridge.

    The commit 724fabf5df13 ("dt-bindings: phy: qcom,qmp-usb3-dp: Add DP phy

    this change is not backwards compatible, placing additional requirements
    onto qcom,sc7180-qmp-usb3-phy and qcom,sdm845-qmp-usb3-phy device nodes
    (to include separate DP part, etc). However the aforementioned nodes do
    not inclue DP part, they strictly follow the schema defined in the
    qcom,qmp-phy.yaml file. Move those compatibles, leaving
    qcom,qmp-usb3-dp-phy.yaml to describe only real "combo" USB3+DP device nodes.

    commit 9468e7b031876935230182628f8d5f216c071784 upstream.
    
    When adding support for V3U (r8a779a0) it was incorrectly recorded it
    supports four nodes, while in fact it supports five. The fifth node is
    named TSC0 and breaks the existing naming schema starting at 1. Work
    around this by separately defining the reg property for V3U and others.
    
    Restore the maximum number of nodes to three for other compatibles as
    it was before erroneously increasing it for V3U.

    commit 34138a59b92c1a30649a18ec442d2e61f3bc34dd upstream.
    
    This clock must be always enabled to allow access to any registers in
    fsys1 CMU. Until proper solution based on runtime PM is applied
    (similar to what was done for Exynos5433), mark that clock as critical
    so it won't be disabled.
    
    It was observed on Samsung Galaxy S6 device (based on Exynos7420), where
    UFS module is probed before pmic used to power that device.
    In this case defer probe was happening and that clock was disabled by
    UFS driver, causing whole boot to hang on next CMU access.

    drm/i915: Fix crash in auto_retire
    
    commit 402be8a101190969fc7ff122d07e262df86e132b upstream.
    
    The retire logic uses the 2 lower bits of the pointer to the retire
    function to store flags. However, the auto_retire function is not
    guaranteed to be aligned to a multiple of 4, which causes crashes as
    we jump to the wrong address, for example like this:

    commit d9aa6571b28ba0022de1e48801ff03a1854c7ef2 upstream.
    
    Link status is different from display connected status in the case
    of something like an Apple dongle where the type-c plug can be
    connected, and therefore the link is connected, but no sink is
    connected until an HDMI cable is plugged into the dongle.
    The sink_count of DPCD of dongle will increase to 1 once an HDMI
    cable is plugged into the dongle so that display connected status
    will become true. This checking also apply at pm_resume.

    drm/i915/gt: Fix a double free in gen8_preallocate_top_level_pdp
    
    commit ea995218dddba171fecd05496c69617c5ef3c5b8 upstream.
    
    Our code analyzer reported a double free bug.
    
    In gen8_preallocate_top_level_pdp, pde and pde->pt.base are allocated
    via alloc_pd(vm) with one reference. If pin_pt_dma() failed, pde->pt.base
    is freed by i915_gem_object_put() with a reference dropped. Then free_pd
    calls free_px() defined in intel_ppgtt.c, which calls i915_gem_object_put()
    to put pde->pt.base again.
    
    As pde->pt.base is protected by refcount, so the second put will not free
    pde->pt.base actually. But, maybe it is better to remove the first put?

    clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Handle dra7 timer wrap errata i940
    
    commit 25de4ce5ed02994aea8bc111d133308f6fd62566 upstream.
    
    There is a timer wrap issue on dra7 for the ARM architected timer.
    In a typical clock configuration the timer fails to wrap after 388 days.
    
    To work around the issue, we need to use timer-ti-dm percpu timers instead.
    
    Let's configure dmtimer3 and 4 as percpu timers by default, and warn about
    the issue if the dtb is not configured properly.
    
    Let's do this as a single patch so it can be backported to v5.8 and later
    kernels easily. Note that this patch depends on earlier timer-ti-dm
    systimer posted mode fixes, and a preparatory clockevent patch
    "clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Prepare to handle dra7 timer wrap issue".
    
    For more information, please see the errata for "AM572x Sitara Processors
    Silicon Revisions 1.1, 2.0":
    
    https://www.ti.com/lit/er/sprz429m/sprz429m.pdf
    
    The concept is based on earlier reference patches done by Tero Kristo and
    Keerthy.

    MIPS: Avoid handcoded DIVU in `__div64_32' altogether
    
    commit 25ab14cbe9d1b66fda44c71a2db7582a31b6f5cd upstream.
    
    Remove the inline asm with a DIVU instruction from `__div64_32' and use
    plain C code for the intended DIVMOD calculation instead.  GCC is smart
    enough to know that both the quotient and the remainder are calculated
    with single DIVU, so with ISAs up to R5 the same instruction is actually
    produced with overall similar code.
    
    For R6 compiled code will work, but separate DIVU and MODU instructions
    will be produced, which are also interlocked, so scalar implementations
    will likely not perform as well as older ISAs with their asynchronous MD
    unit.  Likely still faster then the generic algorithm though.
    
    This removes a compilation error for R6 however where the original DIVU
    instruction is not supported anymore and the MDU accumulator registers
    have been removed and consequently GCC complains as to a constraint it
    cannot find a register for:

    MIPS: Avoid DIVU in `__div64_32' is result would be zero
    
    commit c1d337d45ec0a802299688e17d568c4e3a585895 upstream.
    
    We already check the high part of the divident against zero to avoid the
    costly DIVU instruction in that case, needed to reduce the high part of
    the divident, so we may well check against the divisor instead and set
    the high part of the quotient to zero right away.  We need to treat the
    high part the divident in that case though as the remainder that would
    be calculated by the DIVU instruction we avoided.
    
    This has passed correctness verification with test_div64 and reduced the
    module's average execution time down to 1.0445s and 0.2619s from 1.0668s
    and 0.2629s respectively for an R3400 CPU @40MHz and a 5Kc CPU @160MHz.

    MIPS: Reinstate platform `__div64_32' handler
    
    commit c49f71f60754acbff37505e1d16ca796bf8a8140 upstream.
    
    Our current MIPS platform `__div64_32' handler is inactive, because it
    is incorrectly only enabled for 64-bit configurations, for which generic
    `do_div' code does not call it anyway.
    
    The handler is not suitable for being called from there though as it
    only calculates 32 bits of the quotient under the assumption the 64-bit
    divident has been suitably reduced.  Code for such reduction used to be
    there, however it has been incorrectly removed with commit c21004cd5b4c
    ("MIPS: Rewrite <asm/div64.h> to work with gcc 4.4.0."), which should
    have only updated an obsoleted constraint for an inline asm involving
    $hi and $lo register outputs, while possibly wiring the original MIPS
    variant of the `do_div' macro as `__div64_32' handler for the generic
    `do_div' implementation
    
    Correct the handler as follows then:
    
    - Revert most of the commit referred, however retaining the current
      formatting, except for the final two instructions of the inline asm
      sequence, which the original commit missed.  Omit the original 64-bit
      parts though.
    
    - Rename the original `do_div' macro to `__div64_32'.  Use the combined
      `x' constraint referring to the MD accumulator as a whole, replacing
      the original individual `h' and `l' constraints used for $hi and $lo
      registers respectively, of which `h' has been obsoleted with GCC 4.4.
      Update surrounding code accordingly.
    
      We have since removed support for GCC versions before 4.9, so no need
      for a special arrangement here; GCC has supported the `x' constraint
      since forever anyway, or at least going back to 1991.
    
    - Rename the `__base' local variable in `__div64_32' to `__radix' to
      avoid a conflict with a local variable in `do_div'.
    
    - Actually enable this code for 32-bit rather than 64-bit configurations
      by qualifying it with BITS_PER_LONG being 32 instead of 64.  Include
      <asm/bitsperlong.h> for this macro rather than <linux/types.h> as we
      don't need anything else.
    
    - Finally include <asm-generic/div64.h> last rather than first.
    
    This has passed correctness verification with test_div64 and reduced the
    module's average execution time down to 1.0668s and 0.2629s from 2.1529s
    and 0.5647s respectively for an R3400 CPU @40MHz and a 5Kc CPU @160MHz.
    For a reference 64-bit `do_div' code where we have the DDIVU instruction
    available to do the whole calculation right away averages at 0.0660s for
    the latter CPU.

    mm: fix struct page layout on 32-bit systems
    
    commit 9ddb3c14afba8bc5950ed297f02d4ae05ff35cd1 upstream.
    
    32-bit architectures which expect 8-byte alignment for 8-byte integers and
    need 64-bit DMA addresses (arm, mips, ppc) had their struct page
    inadvertently expanded in 2019.  When the dma_addr_t was added, it forced
    the alignment of the union to 8 bytes, which inserted a 4 byte gap between
    'flags' and the union.
    
    Fix this by storing the dma_addr_t in one or two adjacent unsigned longs.
    This restores the alignment to that of an unsigned long.  We always
    store the low bits in the first word to prevent the PageTail bit from
    being inadvertently set on a big endian platform.  If that happened,
    get_user_pages_fast() racing against a page which was freed and
    reallocated to the page_pool could dereference a bogus compound_head(),
    which would be hard to trace back to this cause.

    Disable preemption when probing a user return MSR via RDSMR/WRMSR.  If
    the MSR holds a different value per logical CPU, the WRMSR could corrupt
    the host's value if KVM is preempted between the RDMSR and WRMSR, and
    then rescheduled on a different CPU.

    KVM: nVMX: Always make an attempt to map eVMCS after migration
    
    commit f5c7e8425f18fdb9bdb7d13340651d7876890329 upstream.
    
    When enlightened VMCS is in use and nested state is migrated with
    vmx_get_nested_state()/vmx_set_nested_state() KVM can't map evmcs
    page right away: evmcs gpa is not 'struct kvm_vmx_nested_state_hdr'
    and we can't read it from VP assist page because userspace may decide
    to restore HV_X64_MSR_VP_ASSIST_PAGE after restoring nested state
    (and QEMU, for example, does exactly that). To make sure eVMCS is
    mapped /vmx_set_nested_state() raises KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES
    request.
    
    Commit f2c7ef3ba955 ("KVM: nSVM: cancel KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES
    on nested vmexit") added KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES clearing to
    nested_vmx_vmexit() to make sure MSR permission bitmap is not switched
    when an immediate exit from L2 to L1 happens right after migration (caused
    by a pending event, for example). Unfortunately, in the exact same
    situation we still need to have eVMCS mapped so
    nested_sync_vmcs12_to_shadow() reflects changes in VMCS12 to eVMCS.
    
    As a band-aid, restore nested_get_evmcs_page() when clearing
    KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES in nested_vmx_vmexit(). The 'fix' is far
    from being ideal as we can't easily propagate possible failures and even if
    we could, this is most likely already too late to do so. The whole
    'KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES' idea for mapping eVMCS after migration
    seems to be fragile as we diverge too much from the 'native' path when
    vmptr loading happens on vmx_set_nested_state().

    commit 36fa06f9ff39f23e03cd8206dc6bbb7711c23be6 upstream.
    
    Allow userspace to enable RDPID for a guest without also enabling RDTSCP.
    Aside from checking for RDPID support in the obvious flows, VMX also needs
    to set ENABLE_RDTSCP=1 when RDPID is exposed.
    
    For the record, there is no known scenario where enabling RDPID without
    RDTSCP is desirable.  But, both AMD and Intel architectures allow for the
    condition, i.e. this is purely to make KVM more architecturally accurate.

    commit 85d0011264da24be08ae907d7f29983a597ca9b1 upstream.
    
    Do not advertise emulation support for RDPID if RDTSCP is unsupported.
    RDPID emulation subtly relies on MSR_TSC_AUX to exist in hardware, as
    both vmx_get_msr() and svm_get_msr() will return an error if the MSR is
    unsupported, i.e. ctxt->ops->get_msr() will fail and the emulator will
    inject a #UD.
    
    Note, RDPID emulation also relies on RDTSCP being enabled in the guest,
    but this is a KVM bug and will eventually be fixed.

    alarmtimer: Check RTC features instead of ops
    
    commit e09784a8a751e539dffc94d43bc917b0ac1e934a upstream.
    
    RTC drivers used to leave .set_alarm() NULL in order to signal the RTC
    device doesn't support alarms. The drivers are now clearing the
    RTC_FEATURE_ALARM bit for that purpose in order to keep the rtc_class_ops
    structure const. So now, .set_alarm() is set unconditionally and this
    possibly causes the alarmtimer code to select an RTC device that doesn't
    support alarms.
    
    Test RTC_FEATURE_ALARM instead of relying on ops->set_alarm to determine
    whether alarms are available.

    iio: core: fix ioctl handlers removal
    
    commit 901f84de0e16bde10a72d7eb2f2eb73fcde8fa1a upstream.
    
    Currently ioctl handlers are removed twice. For the first time during
    iio_device_unregister() then later on inside
    iio_device_unregister_eventset() and iio_buffers_free_sysfs_and_mask().
    Double free leads to kernel panic.
    
    Fix this by not touching ioctl handlers list directly but rather
    letting code responsible for registration call the matching cleanup
    routine itself.

    commit dda32c00c9a0fa103b5d54ef72c477b7aa993679 upstream.
    
    'xhci_urb_enqueue()' is passed a 'mem_flags' argument, because "URBs may be

    in 'drivers/usb/core/urb.c')
    
    So this flag should be used in all the calling chain.
    Up to now, 'xhci_check_maxpacket()' which is only called from
    'xhci_urb_enqueue()', uses GFP_KERNEL.
    
    Be safe and pass the mem_flags to this function as well.

    xhci: Fix giving back cancelled URBs even if halted endpoint can't reset
    
    commit 9b6a126ae58d9edfdde2d5f2e87f7615ea5e0155 upstream.
    
    Commit 9ebf30007858 ("xhci: Fix halted endpoint at stop endpoint command
    completion") in 5.12 changes how cancelled URBs are given back.
    
    To cancel a URB xhci driver needs to stop the endpoint first.
    To clear a halted endpoint xhci driver needs to reset the endpoint.
    
    In rare cases when an endpoint halt (error) races with a endpoint stop we
    need to clear the reset before removing, and giving back the cancelled URB.
    
    The above change in 5.12 takes care of this, but it also relies on the
    reset endpoint completion handler to give back the cancelled URBs.
    
    There are cases when driver refuses to queue reset endpoint commands,
    for example when a link suddenly goes to an inactive error state.
    In this case the cancelled URB is never given back.
    
    Fix this by giving back the URB in the stop endpoint if queuing a reset
    endpoint command fails.

    usb: typec: ucsi: Retrieve all the PDOs instead of just the first 4
    
    commit 1f4642b72be79757f050924a9b9673b6a02034bc upstream.
    
    commit 4dbc6a4ef06d ("usb: typec: ucsi: save power data objects
    in PD mode") introduced retrieval of the PDOs when connected to a
    PD-capable source. But only the first 4 PDOs are received since
    that is the maximum number that can be fetched at a time given the
    MESSAGE_IN length limitation (16 bytes). However, as per the PD spec
    a connected source may advertise up to a maximum of 7 PDOs.
    
    If such a source is connected it's possible the PPM could have
    negotiated a power contract with one of the PDOs at index greater
    than 4, and would be reflected in the request data object's (RDO)
    object position field. This would result in an out-of-bounds access
    when the rdo_index() is used to index into the src_pdos array in
    ucsi_psy_get_voltage_now().
    
    With the help of the UBSAN -fsanitize=array-bounds checker enabled
    this exact issue is revealed when connecting to a PD source adapter
    that advertise 5 PDOs and the PPM enters a contract having selected
    the 5th one.

    usb: dwc2: Fix gadget DMA unmap direction
    
    commit 75a41ce46bae6cbe7d3bb2584eb844291d642874 upstream.
    
    The dwc2 gadget support maps and unmaps DMA buffers as necessary. When
    mapping and unmapping it uses the direction of the endpoint to select
    the direction of the DMA transfer, but this fails for Control OUT
    transfers because the unmap occurs after the endpoint direction has
    been reversed for the status phase.
    
    A possible solution would be to unmap the buffer before the direction
    is changed, but a safer, less invasive fix is to remember the buffer
    direction independently of the endpoint direction.

    usb: dwc3: omap: improve extcon initialization
    
    commit e17b02d4970913233d543c79c9c66e72cac05bdd upstream.
    
    When extcon is used in combination with dwc3, it is assumed that the dwc3
    registers are untouched and as such are only configured if VBUS is valid
    or ID is tied to ground.
    
    In case VBUS is not valid or ID is floating, the registers are not
    configured as such during driver initialization, causing a wrong
    default state during boot.
    
    If the registers are not in a default state, because they are for
    instance touched by a boot loader, this can cause for a kernel error.

    blk-mq: Swap two calls in blk_mq_exit_queue()
    
    [ Upstream commit 630ef623ed26c18a457cdc070cf24014e50129c2 ]
    
    If a tag set is shared across request queues (e.g. SCSI LUNs) then the
    block layer core keeps track of the number of active request queues in
    tags->active_queues. blk_mq_tag_busy() and blk_mq_tag_idle() update that
    atomic counter if the hctx flag BLK_MQ_F_TAG_QUEUE_SHARED is set. Make
    sure that blk_mq_exit_queue() calls blk_mq_tag_idle() before that flag is
    cleared by blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set().

    blk-mq: plug request for shared sbitmap
    
    [ Upstream commit 03f26d8f11403295de445b6e4e0e57ac57755791 ]
    
    In case of shared sbitmap, request won't be held in plug list any more
    sine commit 32bc15afed04 ("blk-mq: Facilitate a shared sbitmap per
    tagset"), this way makes request merge from flush plug list & batching
    submission not possible, so cause performance regression.
    
    Yanhui reports performance regression when running sequential IO
    test(libaio, 16 jobs, 8 depth for each job) in VM, and the VM disk
    is emulated with image stored on xfs/megaraid_sas.
    
    Fix the issue by recovering original behavior to allow to hold request
    in plug list.

    powerpc/64s: Make NMI record implicitly soft-masked code as irqs disabled
    
    [ Upstream commit 4ec5feec1ad029bdf7d49bc50ccc0c195eeabe93 ]
    
    scv support introduced the notion of code that implicitly soft-masks
    irqs due to the instruction addresses. This is required because scv
    enters the kernel with MSR[EE]=1.
    
    If a NMI (including soft-NMI) interrupt hits when we are implicitly
    soft-masked then its regs->softe does not reflect this because it is
    derived from the explicit soft mask state (paca->irq_soft_mask). This
    makes arch_irq_disabled_regs(regs) return false.
    
    This can trigger a warning in the soft-NMI watchdog code (shown below).
    Fix it by having NMI interrupts set regs->softe to disabled in case of
    interrupting an implicit soft-masked region.

    Open /dev/nbdX first, the config_refs will be 1 and
    the pointers in nbd_device are still null. Disconnect
    /dev/nbdX, then reference a null recv_workq. The
    protection by config_refs in nbd_genl_disconnect is useless.

    sched/fair: Fix clearing of has_idle_cores flag in select_idle_cpu()

    In commit:
    
      9fe1f127b913 ("sched/fair: Merge select_idle_core/cpu()")
    
    in select_idle_cpu(), we check if an idle core is present in the LLC
    of the target CPU via the flag "has_idle_cores". We look for the idle
    core in select_idle_cores(). If select_idle_cores() isn't able to find
    an idle core/CPU, we need to unset the has_idle_cores flag in the LLC
    of the target to prevent other CPUs from going down this route.
    
    However, the current code is unsetting it in the LLC of the current
    CPU instead of the target CPU. This patch fixes this issue.

    When running some traffic and taking down the link on peer, a

    nvmet_rdma_error_comp which tried accessing the cq_context to
    obtain the queue. The cq_context is no longer valid after the

    to how it is obtained in other functions from the wc->qp.

    nvmet: fix inline bio check for passthru
    
    [ Upstream commit ab96de5def854d8fc51280b6a20597e64b14ac31 ]
    
    When handling passthru commands, for inline bio allocation we only
    consider the transfer size. This works well when req->sg_cnt fits into
    the req->inline_bvec, but it will result in the early return from
    bio_add_hw_page() when req->sg_cnt > NVMET_MAX_INLINE_BVEC.
    
    Consider an I/O of size 32768 and first buffer is not aligned to the
    page boundary, then I/O is split in following manner :-
    
    [ 2206.256140] nvmet: sg->length 3440 sg->offset 656
    [ 2206.256144] nvmet: sg->length 4096 sg->offset 0
    [ 2206.256148] nvmet: sg->length 4096 sg->offset 0
    [ 2206.256152] nvmet: sg->length 4096 sg->offset 0
    [ 2206.256155] nvmet: sg->length 4096 sg->offset 0
    [ 2206.256159] nvmet: sg->length 4096 sg->offset 0
    [ 2206.256163] nvmet: sg->length 4096 sg->offset 0
    [ 2206.256166] nvmet: sg->length 4096 sg->offset 0
    [ 2206.256170] nvmet: sg->length 656 sg->offset 0
    
    Now the req->transfer_size == NVMET_MAX_INLINE_DATA_LEN i.e. 32768, but
    the req->sg_cnt is (9) > NVMET_MAX_INLINE_BIOVEC which is (8).
    This will result in early return in the following code path :-
    
    nvmet_bdev_execute_rw()
            bio_add_pc_page()
                    bio_add_hw_page()
                            if (bio_full(bio, len))
                                    return 0;
    
    Use previously introduced helper nvmet_use_inline_bvec() to consider
    req->sg_cnt when using inline bio. This only affects nvme-loop
    transport.

    nvmet: fix inline bio check for bdev-ns
    
    [ Upstream commit 608a969046e6e0567d05a166be66c77d2dd8220b ]
    
    When handling rw commands, for inline bio case we only consider
    transfer size. This works well when req->sg_cnt fits into the
    req->inline_bvec, but it will result in the warning in
    __bio_add_page() when req->sg_cnt > NVMET_MAX_INLINE_BVEC.
    
    Consider an I/O size 32768 and first page is not aligned to the page

    [ 2206.256170] nvmet: sg->length 656 sg->offset 0
    
    Now the req->transfer_size == NVMET_MAX_INLINE_DATA_LEN i.e. 32768, but
    the req->sg_cnt is (9) > NVMET_MAX_INLINE_BIOVEC which is (8).

                            WARN_ON_ONCE(bio_full(bio, len));
    
    This scenario is very hard to reproduce on the nvme-loop transport only
    with rw commands issued with the passthru IOCTL interface from the host
    application and the data buffer is allocated with the malloc() and not
    the posix_memalign().

    kyber: fix out of bounds access when preempted
    
    [ Upstream commit efed9a3337e341bd0989161b97453b52567bc59d ]
    
    __blk_mq_sched_bio_merge() gets the ctx and hctx for the current CPU and
    passes the hctx to ->bio_merge(). kyber_bio_merge() then gets the ctx
    for the current CPU again and uses that to get the corresponding Kyber
    context in the passed hctx. However, the thread may be preempted between
    the two calls to blk_mq_get_ctx(), and the ctx returned the second time
    may no longer correspond to the passed hctx. This "works" accidentally
    most of the time, but it can cause us to read garbage if the second ctx
    came from an hctx with more ctx's than the first one (i.e., if
    ctx->index_hw[hctx->type] > hctx->nr_ctx).
    
    This manifested as this UBSAN array index out of bounds error reported
    by Jakub:
    
    UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in ../kernel/locking/qspinlock.c:130:9

    Only Kyber uses the hctx, so fix it by passing the request_queue to
    ->bio_merge() instead. BFQ and mq-deadline just use that, and Kyber can
    map the queues itself to avoid the mismatch.

    iio: core: return ENODEV if ioctl is unknown
    
    [ Upstream commit af0670b0bf1b116fd729b1b1011cf814bc34e12e ]
    
    When the ioctl() mechanism was introduced in IIO core to centralize the
    registration of all ioctls in one place via commit 8dedcc3eee3ac ("iio:
    core: centralize ioctl() calls to the main chardev"), the return code was
    changed from ENODEV to EINVAL, when the ioctl code isn't known.
    
    This was done by accident.
    
    This change reverts back to the old behavior, where if the ioctl() code
    isn't known, ENODEV is returned (vs EINVAL).
    
    This was brought into perspective by this patch:

    iio: hid-sensors: select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER under HID_SENSOR_IIO_TRIGGER
    
    [ Upstream commit 7061803522ee7876df1ca18cdd1e1551f761352d ]
    
    During commit 067fda1c065ff ("iio: hid-sensors: move triggered buffer
    setup into hid_sensor_setup_trigger"), the
    iio_triggered_buffer_{setup,cleanup}() functions got moved under the
    hid-sensor-trigger module.
    
    The above change works fine, if any of the sensors get built. However, when
    only the common hid-sensor-trigger module gets built (and none of the
    drivers), then the IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER symbol isn't selected/enforced.
    
    Previously, each driver would enforce/select the IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
    symbol. With this change the HID_SENSOR_IIO_TRIGGER (for the
    hid-sensor-trigger module) will enforce that IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER gets
    selected.
    
    All HID sensor drivers select the HID_SENSOR_IIO_TRIGGER symbol. So, this
    change removes the IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER enforcement from each driver.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Free gadget structure only after freeing endpoints
    
    [ Upstream commit bb9c74a5bd1462499fe5ccb1e3c5ac40dcfa9139 ]
    
    As part of commit e81a7018d93a ("usb: dwc3: allocate gadget structure
    dynamically") the dwc3_gadget_release() was added which will free
    the dwc->gadget structure upon the device's removal when
    usb_del_gadget_udc() is called in dwc3_gadget_exit().
    
    However, simply freeing the gadget results a dangling pointer
    situation: the endpoints created in dwc3_gadget_init_endpoints()
    have their dep->endpoint.ep_list members chained off the list_head
    anchored at dwc->gadget->ep_list.  Thus when dwc->gadget is freed,
    the first dwc3_ep in the list now has a dangling prev pointer and
    likewise for the next pointer of the dwc3_ep at the tail of the list.
    The dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() that follows will result in a
    use-after-free when it calls list_del().
    
    This was caught by enabling KASAN and performing a driver unbind.
    The recent commit 568262bf5492 ("usb: dwc3: core: Add shutdown
    callback for dwc3") also exposes this as a panic during shutdown.
    
    There are a few possibilities to fix this.  One could be to perform
    a list_del() of the gadget->ep_list itself which removes it from
    the rest of the dwc3_ep chain.
    
    Another approach is what this patch does, by splitting up the
    usb_del_gadget_udc() call into its separate "del" and "put"
    components.  This allows dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() to be
    called before the gadget is finally freed with usb_put_gadget().

    dax: Wake up all waiters after invalidating dax entry
    
    [ Upstream commit 237388320deffde7c2d65ed8fc9eef670dc979b3 ]
    
    I am seeing missed wakeups which ultimately lead to a deadlock when I am
    using virtiofs with DAX enabled and running "make -j". I had to mount
    virtiofs as rootfs and also reduce to dax window size to 256M to reproduce
    the problem consistently.
    
    So here is the problem. put_unlocked_entry() wakes up waiters only
    if entry is not null as well as !dax_is_conflict(entry). But if I
    call multiple instances of invalidate_inode_pages2() in parallel,
    then I can run into a situation where there are waiters on
    this index but nobody will wake these waiters.
    
    invalidate_inode_pages2()
      invalidate_inode_pages2_range()
        invalidate_exceptional_entry2()
          dax_invalidate_mapping_entry_sync()
            __dax_invalidate_entry() {
                    xas_lock_irq(&xas);
                    entry = get_unlocked_entry(&xas, 0);
                    ...
                    ...
                    dax_disassociate_entry(entry, mapping, trunc);
                    xas_store(&xas, NULL);
                    ...
                    ...
                    put_unlocked_entry(&xas, entry);
                    xas_unlock_irq(&xas);
            }
    
    Say a fault in in progress and it has locked entry at offset say "0x1c".
    Now say three instances of invalidate_inode_pages2() are in progress
    (A, B, C) and they all try to invalidate entry at offset "0x1c". Given
    dax entry is locked, all tree instances A, B, C will wait in wait queue.
    
    When dax fault finishes, say A is woken up. It will store NULL entry
    at index "0x1c" and wake up B. When B comes along it will find "entry=0"
    at page offset 0x1c and it will call put_unlocked_entry(&xas, 0). And
    this means put_unlocked_entry() will not wake up next waiter, given
    the current code. And that means C continues to wait and is not woken
    up.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by waking up all waiters when a dax entry
    has been invalidated. This seems to fix the deadlock I am facing
    and I can make forward progress.

    While this is unlikely to happen, it's possible.
    
    Delegate queue_work() to irq_work() which postpones it until the
    tk_core.seq write held region is left and interrupts are reenabled.

    kvm: exit halt polling on need_resched() as well
    
    commit 262de4102c7bb8e59f26a967a8ffe8cce85cc537 upstream.
    
    single_task_running() is usually more general than need_resched()
    but CFS_BANDWIDTH throttling will use resched_task() when there
    is just one task to get the task to block. This was causing
    long-need_resched warnings and was likely allowing VMs to
    overrun their quota when halt polling.

    drm/i915/dp: Use slow and wide link training for everything
    
    commit a5c936add6a23c15c6ae538ab7a12f80751fdf0f upstream.
    
    Screen flickers on Innolux eDP 1.3 panel when clock rate 540000 is in use.
    
    According to the panel vendor, though clock rate 540000 is advertised,
    but the max clock rate it really supports is 270000.
    
    Ville Syrjälä mentioned that fast and narrow also breaks some eDP 1.4
    panel, so use slow and wide training for all panels to resolve the
    issue.
    
    User also confirmed that the new strategy doesn't introduce any
    regression on XPS 9380.

    drm/i915: Avoid div-by-zero on gen2
    
    commit 4819d16d91145966ce03818a95169df1fd56b299 upstream.
    
    Gen2 tiles are 2KiB in size so i915_gem_object_get_tile_row_size()
    can in fact return <4KiB, which leads to div-by-zero here.
    Avoid that.
    
    Not sure i915_gem_object_get_tile_row_size() is entirely
    sane anyway since it doesn't account for the different tile
    layouts on i8xx/i915...
    
    I'm not able to hit this before commit 6846895fde05 ("drm/i915:
    Replace PIN_NONFAULT with calls to PIN_NOEVICT") and it looks
    like I also need to run recent version of Mesa. With those in
    place xonotic trips on this quite easily on my 85x.

    drm/radeon/dpm: Disable sclk switching on Oland when two 4K 60Hz monitors are connected
    
    commit 227545b9a08c68778ddd89428f99c351fc9315ac upstream.
    
    Screen flickers rapidly when two 4K 60Hz monitors are in use. This issue
    doesn't happen when one monitor is 4K 60Hz (pixelclock 594MHz) and
    another one is 4K 30Hz (pixelclock 297MHz).
    
    The issue is gone after setting "power_dpm_force_performance_level" to
    "high". Following the indication, we found that the issue occurs when
    sclk is too low.
    
    So resolve the issue by disabling sclk switching when there are two
    monitors requires high pixelclock (> 297MHz).
    
    v2:
     - Only apply the fix to Oland.

    The fstests test case generic/475 creates a dm-linear device that gets
    changed to a dm-error device. This leads to errors in loading the block
    group's zone information when running on a zoned file system, ultimately
    resulting in a list corruption. When running on a kernel with list
    debugging enabled this leads to the following crash.

    btrfs: fix race leading to unpersisted data and metadata on fsync
    
    commit 626e9f41f7c281ba3e02843702f68471706aa6d9 upstream.
    
    When doing a fast fsync on a file, there is a race which can result in the
    fsync returning success to user space without logging the inode and without
    durably persisting new data.
    
    The following example shows one possible scenario for this:
    
       $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc
       $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt
    
       $ touch /mnt/bar
       $ xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xab 0 1M" -c "fsync" /mnt/baz
    
       # Now we have:
       # file bar == inode 257
       # file baz == inode 258
    
       $ mv /mnt/baz /mnt/foo
    
       # Now we have:
       # file bar == inode 257
       # file foo == inode 258
    
       $ xfs_io -c "pwrite -S 0xcd 0 1M" /mnt/foo
    
       # fsync bar before foo, it is important to trigger the race.
       $ xfs_io -c "fsync" /mnt/bar
       $ xfs_io -c "fsync" /mnt/foo
    
       # After this:
       # inode 257, file bar, is empty
       # inode 258, file foo, has 1M filled with 0xcd
    
       <power failure>
    
       # Replay the log:
       $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt
    
       # After this point file foo should have 1M filled with 0xcd and not 0xab
    
    The following steps explain how the race happens:
    
    1) Before the first fsync of inode 258, when it has the "baz" name, its
       ->logged_trans is 0, ->last_sub_trans is 0 and ->last_log_commit is -1.
       The inode also has the full sync flag set;
    
    2) After the first fsync, we set inode 258 ->logged_trans to 6, which is
       the generation of the current transaction, and set ->last_log_commit
       to 0, which is the current value of ->last_sub_trans (done at
       btrfs_log_inode()).
    
       The full sync flag is cleared from the inode during the fsync.
    
       The log sub transaction that was committed had an ID of 0 and when we
       synced the log, at btrfs_sync_log(), we incremented root->log_transid
       from 0 to 1;
    
    3) During the rename:
    
       We update inode 258, through btrfs_update_inode(), and that causes its
       ->last_sub_trans to be set to 1 (the current log transaction ID), and
       ->last_log_commit remains with a value of 0.
    
       After updating inode 258, because we have previously logged the inode
       in the previous fsync, we log again the inode through the call to
       btrfs_log_new_name(). This results in updating the inode's
       ->last_log_commit from 0 to 1 (the current value of its
       ->last_sub_trans).
    
       The ->last_sub_trans of inode 257 is updated to 1, which is the ID of
       the next log transaction;
    
    4) Then a buffered write against inode 258 is made. This leaves the value
       of ->last_sub_trans as 1 (the ID of the current log transaction, stored
       at root->log_transid);
    
    5) Then an fsync against inode 257 (or any other inode other than 258),
       happens. This results in committing the log transaction with ID 1,
       which results in updating root->last_log_commit to 1 and bumping
       root->log_transid from 1 to 2;
    
    6) Then an fsync against inode 258 starts. We flush delalloc and wait only
       for writeback to complete, since the full sync flag is not set in the
       inode's runtime flags - we do not wait for ordered extents to complete.
    
       Then, at btrfs_sync_file(), we call btrfs_inode_in_log() before the
       ordered extent completes. The call returns true:
    
         static inline bool btrfs_inode_in_log(...)
         {
             bool ret = false;
    
             spin_lock(&inode->lock);
             if (inode->logged_trans == generation &&
                 inode->last_sub_trans <= inode->last_log_commit &&
                 inode->last_sub_trans <= inode->root->last_log_commit)
                     ret = true;
             spin_unlock(&inode->lock);
             return ret;
         }
    
       generation has a value of 6 (fs_info->generation), ->logged_trans also
       has a value of 6 (set when we logged the inode during the first fsync
       and when logging it during the rename), ->last_sub_trans has a value
       of 1, set during the rename (step 3), ->last_log_commit also has a
       value of 1 (set in step 3) and root->last_log_commit has a value of 1,
       which was set in step 5 when fsyncing inode 257.
    
       As a consequence we don't log the inode, any new extents and do not
       sync the log, resulting in a data loss if a power failure happens
       after the fsync and before the current transaction commits.
       Also, because we do not log the inode, after a power failure the mtime
       and ctime of the inode do not match those we had before.
    
       When the ordered extent completes before we call btrfs_inode_in_log(),
       then the call returns false and we log the inode and sync the log,
       since at the end of ordered extent completion we update the inode and
       set ->last_sub_trans to 2 (the value of root->log_transid) and
       ->last_log_commit to 1.
    
    This problem is found after removing the check for the emptiness of the
    inode's list of modified extents in the recent commit 209ecbb8585bf6
    ("btrfs: remove stale comment and logic from btrfs_inode_in_log()"),
    added in the 5.13 merge window. However checking the emptiness of the
    list is not really the way to solve this problem, and was never intended
    to, because while that solves the problem for COW writes, the problem
    persists for NOCOW writes because in that case the list is always empty.
    
    In the case of NOCOW writes, even though we wait for the writeback to
    complete before returning from btrfs_sync_file(), we end up not logging
    the inode, which has a new mtime/ctime, and because we don't sync the log,
    we never issue disk barriers (send REQ_PREFLUSH to the device) since that
    only happens when we sync the log (when we write super blocks at
    btrfs_sync_log()). So effectively, for a NOCOW case, when we return from
    btrfs_sync_file() to user space, we are not guaranteeing that the data is
    durably persisted on disk.
    
    Also, while the example above uses a rename exchange to show how the
    problem happens, it is not the only way to trigger it. An alternative
    could be adding a new hard link to inode 258, since that also results
    in calling btrfs_log_new_name() and updating the inode in the log.
    An example reproducer using the addition of a hard link instead of a
    rename operation:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc
      $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt
    
      $ touch /mnt/bar
      $ xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xab 0 1M" -c "fsync" /mnt/foo
    
      $ ln /mnt/foo /mnt/foo_link
      $ xfs_io -c "pwrite -S 0xcd 0 1M" /mnt/foo
    
      $ xfs_io -c "fsync" /mnt/bar
      $ xfs_io -c "fsync" /mnt/foo
    
      <power failure>
    
      # Replay the log:
      $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt
    
      # After this point file foo often has 1M filled with 0xab and not 0xcd
    
    The reasons leading to the final fsync of file foo, inode 258, not
    persisting the new data are the same as for the previous example with
    a rename operation.
    
    So fix by never skipping logging and log syncing when there are still any
    ordered extents in flight. To avoid making the conditional if statement
    that checks if logging an inode is needed harder to read, place all the
    logic into an helper function with separate if statements to make it more
    manageable and easier to read.
    
    A test case for fstests will follow soon.
    
    For NOCOW writes, the problem existed before commit b5e6c3e170b770
    ("btrfs: always wait on ordered extents at fsync time"), introduced in
    kernel 4.19, then it went away with that commit since we started to always
    wait for ordered extent completion before logging.
    
    The problem came back again once the fast fsync path was changed again to
    avoid waiting for ordered extent completion, in commit 487781796d3022
    ("btrfs: make fast fsyncs wait only for writeback"), added in kernel 5.10.
    
    However, for COW writes, the race only happens after the recent
    commit 209ecbb8585bf6 ("btrfs: remove stale comment and logic from
    btrfs_inode_in_log()"), introduced in the 5.13 merge window. For NOCOW
    writes, the bug existed before that commit. So tag 5.10+ as the release
    for stable backports.

    btrfs: zoned: fix silent data loss after failure splitting ordered extent
    
    commit adbd914dcde0b03bfc08ffe40b81f31b0457833f upstream.
    
    On a zoned filesystem, sometimes we need to split an ordered extent into 3
    different ordered extents. The original ordered extent is shortened, at
    the front and at the rear, and we create two other new ordered extents to
    represent the trimmed parts of the original ordered extent.
    
    After adjusting the original ordered extent, we create an ordered extent
    to represent the pre-range, and that may fail with ENOMEM for example.
    After that we always try to create the ordered extent for the post-range,
    and if that happens to succeed we end up returning success to the caller
    as we overwrite the 'ret' variable which contained the previous error.
    
    This means we end up with a file range for which there is no ordered
    extent, which results in the range never getting a new file extent item
    pointing to the new data location. And since the split operation did
    not return an error, writeback does not fail and the inode's mapping is
    not flagged with an error, resulting in a subsequent fsync not reporting
    an error either.
    
    It's possibly very unlikely to have the creation of the post-range ordered
    extent succeed after the creation of the pre-range ordered extent failed,
    but it's not impossible.
    
    So fix this by making sure we only create the post-range ordered extent
    if there was no error creating the ordered extent for the pre-range.

    btrfs: fix deadlock when cloning inline extents and using qgroups
    
    commit f9baa501b4fd6962257853d46ddffbc21f27e344 upstream.
    
    There are a few exceptional cases where cloning an inline extent needs to
    copy the inline extent data into a page of the destination inode.
    
    When this happens, we end up starting a transaction while having a dirty
    page for the destination inode and while having the range locked in the
    destination's inode iotree too. Because when reserving metadata space
    for a transaction we may need to flush existing delalloc in case there is
    not enough free space, we have a mechanism in place to prevent a deadlock,
    which was introduced in commit 3d45f221ce627d ("btrfs: fix deadlock when
    cloning inline extent and low on free metadata space").
    
    However when using qgroups, a transaction also reserves metadata qgroup
    space, which can also result in flushing delalloc in case there is not
    enough available space at the moment. When this happens we deadlock, since
    flushing delalloc requires locking the file range in the inode's iotree
    and the range was already locked at the very beginning of the clone
    operation, before attempting to start the transaction.
    
    When this issue happens, stack traces like the following are reported:

    So fix this by skipping the flush of delalloc for an inode that is
    flagged with BTRFS_INODE_NO_DELALLOC_FLUSH, meaning it is currently under
    such a special case of cloning an inline extent, when flushing delalloc
    during qgroup metadata reservation.
    
    The special cases for cloning inline extents were added in kernel 5.7 by
    by commit 05a5a7621ce66c ("Btrfs: implement full reflink support for
    inline extents"), while having qgroup metadata space reservation flushing
    delalloc when low on space was added in kernel 5.9 by commit
    c53e9653605dbf ("btrfs: qgroup: try to flush qgroup space when we get
    -EDQUOT"). So use a "Fixes:" tag for the later commit to ease stable
    kernel backports.

    arm64: Fix race condition on PG_dcache_clean in __sync_icache_dcache()
    
    commit 588a513d34257fdde95a9f0df0202e31998e85c6 upstream.
    
    To ensure that instructions are observable in a new mapping, the arm64
    set_pte_at() implementation cleans the D-cache and invalidates the
    I-cache to the PoU. As an optimisation, this is only done on executable
    mappings and the PG_dcache_clean page flag is set to avoid future cache
    maintenance on the same page.
    
    When two different processes map the same page (e.g. private executable
    file or shared mapping) there's a potential race on checking and setting
    PG_dcache_clean via set_pte_at() -> __sync_icache_dcache(). While on the
    fault paths the page is locked (PG_locked), mprotect() does not take the
    page lock. The result is that one process may see the PG_dcache_clean
    flag set but the I/D cache maintenance not yet performed.
    
    Avoid test_and_set_bit(PG_dcache_clean) in favour of separate test_bit()
    and set_bit(). In the rare event of a race, the cache maintenance is
    done twice.

    arm64: mte: initialize RGSR_EL1.SEED in __cpu_setup
    
    commit 37a8024d265564eba680575df6421f19db21dfce upstream.
    
    A valid implementation choice for the ChooseRandomNonExcludedTag()
    pseudocode function used by IRG is to behave in the same way as with
    GCR_EL1.RRND=0. This would mean that RGSR_EL1.SEED is used as an LFSR
    which must have a non-zero value in order for IRG to properly produce
    pseudorandom numbers. However, RGSR_EL1 is reset to an UNKNOWN value
    on soft reset and thus may reset to 0. Therefore we must initialize
    RGSR_EL1.SEED to a non-zero value in order to ensure that IRG behaves
    as expected.

    blk-iocost: fix weight updates of inner active iocgs
    
    commit e9f4eee9a0023ba22db9560d4cc6ee63f933dae8 upstream.
    
    When the weight of an active iocg is updated, weight_updated() is called
    which in turn calls __propagate_weights() to update the active and inuse
    weights so that the effective hierarchical weights are update accordingly.
    
    The current implementation is incorrect for inner active nodes. For an
    active leaf iocg, inuse can be any value between 1 and active and the
    difference represents how much the iocg is donating. When weight is updated,
    as long as inuse is clamped between 1 and the new weight, we're alright and
    this is what __propagate_weights() currently implements.
    
    However, that's not how an active inner node's inuse is set. An inner node's
    inuse is solely determined by the ratio between the sums of inuse's and
    active's of its children - ie. they're results of propagating the leaves'
    active and inuse weights upwards. __propagate_weights() incorrectly applies
    the same clamping as for a leaf when an active inner node's weight is
    updated. Consider a hierarchy which looks like the following with saturating
    workloads in AA and BB.
    
         R
       /   \
      A     B
      |     |
     AA     BB
    
    1. For both A and B, active=100, inuse=100, hwa=0.5, hwi=0.5.
    
    2. echo 200 > A/io.weight
    
    3. __propagate_weights() update A's active to 200 and leave inuse at 100 as
       it's already between 1 and the new active, making A:active=200,
       A:inuse=100. As R's active_sum is updated along with A's active,
       A:hwa=2/3, B:hwa=1/3. However, because the inuses didn't change, the
       hwi's remain unchanged at 0.5.
    
    4. The weight of A is now twice that of B but AA and BB still have the same
       hwi of 0.5 and thus are doing the same amount of IOs.
    
    Fix it by making __propgate_weights() always calculate the inuse of an
    active inner iocg based on the ratio of child_inuse_sum to child_active_sum.

    mm/hugetlb: fix cow where page writtable in child
    
    commit 84894e1c42e9f25c17f2888e0c0e1505cb727538 upstream.
    
    When rework early cow of pinned hugetlb pages, we moved huge_ptep_get()
    upper but overlooked a side effect that the huge_ptep_get() will fetch the
    pte after wr-protection.  After moving it upwards, we need explicit
    wr-protect of child pte or we will keep the write bit set in the child
    process, which could cause data corrution where the child can write to the
    original page directly.
    
    This issue can also be exposed by "memfd_test hugetlbfs" kselftest.

    mm/hugetlb: fix F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE
    
    commit 22247efd822e6d263f3c8bd327f3f769aea9b1d9 upstream.
    
    Patch series "mm/hugetlb: Fix issues on file sealing and fork", v2.
    
    Hugh reported issue with F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE not applied correctly to
    hugetlbfs, which I can easily verify using the memfd_test program, which
    seems that the program is hardly run with hugetlbfs pages (as by default
    shmem).
    
    Meanwhile I found another probably even more severe issue on that hugetlb
    fork won't wr-protect child cow pages, so child can potentially write to
    parent private pages.  Patch 2 addresses that.
    
    After this series applied, "memfd_test hugetlbfs" should start to pass.
    
    This patch (of 2):
    
    F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE is missing for hugetlb starting from the first day.
    There is a test program for that and it fails constantly.
    
    $ ./memfd_test hugetlbfs
    memfd-hugetlb: CREATE
    memfd-hugetlb: BASIC
    memfd-hugetlb: SEAL-WRITE
    memfd-hugetlb: SEAL-FUTURE-WRITE
    mmap() didn't fail as expected
    Aborted (core dumped)
    
    I think it's probably because no one is really running the hugetlbfs test.
    
    Fix it by checking FUTURE_WRITE also in hugetlbfs_file_mmap() as what we
    do in shmem_mmap().  Generalize a helper for that.

    kasan: fix unit tests with CONFIG_UBSAN_LOCAL_BOUNDS enabled
    
    commit f649dc0e0d7b509c75570ee403723660f5b72ec7 upstream.
    
    These tests deliberately access these arrays out of bounds, which will
    cause the dynamic local bounds checks inserted by
    CONFIG_UBSAN_LOCAL_BOUNDS to fail and panic the kernel.  To avoid this
    problem, access the arrays via volatile pointers, which will prevent the
    compiler from being able to determine the array bounds.
    
    These accesses use volatile pointers to char (char *volatile) rather than
    the more conventional pointers to volatile char (volatile char *) because
    we want to prevent the compiler from making inferences about the pointer
    itself (i.e.  its array bounds), not the data that it refers to.

    userfaultfd: release page in error path to avoid BUG_ON
    
    commit 7ed9d238c7dbb1fdb63ad96a6184985151b0171c upstream.
    
    Consider the following sequence of events:
    
    1. Userspace issues a UFFD ioctl, which ends up calling into
       shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(). We successfully account the blocks, we
       shmem_alloc_page(), but then the copy_from_user() fails. We return
       -ENOENT. We don't release the page we allocated.
    2. Our caller detects this error code, tries the copy_from_user() after
       dropping the mmap_lock, and retries, calling back into
       shmem_mfill_atomic_pte().
    3. Meanwhile, let's say another process filled up the tmpfs being used.
    4. So shmem_mfill_atomic_pte() fails to account blocks this time, and
       immediately returns - without releasing the page.
    
    This triggers a BUG_ON in our caller, which asserts that the page
    should always be consumed, unless -ENOENT is returned.
    
    To fix this, detect if we have such a "dangling" page when accounting
    fails, and if so, release it before returning.

    squashfs: fix divide error in calculate_skip()
    
    commit d6e621de1fceb3b098ebf435ef7ea91ec4838a1a upstream.
    
    Sysbot has reported a "divide error" which has been identified as being
    caused by a corrupted file_size value within the file inode.  This value
    has been corrupted to a much larger value than expected.
    
    Calculate_skip() is passed i_size_read(inode) >> msblk->block_log.  Due to
    the file_size value corruption this overflows the int argument/variable in
    that function, leading to the divide error.
    
    This patch changes the function to use u64.  This will accommodate any
    unexpectedly large values due to corruption.
    
    The value returned from calculate_skip() is clamped to be never more than
    SQUASHFS_CACHED_BLKS - 1, or 7.  So file_size corruption does not lead to
    an unexpectedly large return result here.

    hfsplus: prevent corruption in shrinking truncate
    
    commit c3187cf32216313fb316084efac4dab3a8459b1d upstream.
    
    I believe there are some issues introduced by commit 31651c607151
    ("hfsplus: avoid deadlock on file truncation")
    
    HFS+ has extent records which always contains 8 extents.  In case the
    first extent record in catalog file gets full, new ones are allocated from
    extents overflow file.
    
    In case shrinking truncate happens to middle of an extent record which
    locates in extents overflow file, the logic in hfsplus_file_truncate() was
    changed so that call to hfs_brec_remove() is not guarded any more.
    
    Right action would be just freeing the extents that exceed the new size
    inside extent record by calling hfsplus_free_extents(), and then check if
    the whole extent record should be removed.  However since the guard
    (blk_cnt > start) is now after the call to hfs_brec_remove(), this has
    unfortunate effect that the last matching extent record is removed
    unconditionally.
    
    To reproduce this issue, create a file which has at least 10 extents, and
    then perform shrinking truncate into middle of the last extent record, so
    that the number of remaining extents is not under or divisible by 8.  This
    causes the last extent record (8 extents) to be removed totally instead of
    truncating into middle of it.  Thus this causes corruption, and lost data.
    
    Fix for this is simply checking if the new truncated end is below the
    start of this extent record, making it safe to remove the full extent
    record.  However call to hfs_brec_remove() can't be moved to it's previous
    place since we're dropping ->tree_lock and it can cause a race condition
    and the cached info being invalidated possibly corrupting the node data.
    
    Another issue is related to this one.  When entering into the block
    (blk_cnt > start) we are not holding the ->tree_lock.  We break out from
    the loop not holding the lock, but hfs_find_exit() does unlock it.  Not
    sure if it's possible for someone else to take the lock under our feet,
    but it can cause hard to debug errors and premature unlocking.  Even if
    there's no real risk of it, the locking should still always be kept in
    balance.  Thus taking the lock now just before the check.

    The entry flush mitigation can be enabled/disabled at runtime via a

    Shows that we returned to userspace with a corrupted LR that points into
    the kernel, due to executing the partially patched call to the fallback
    entry flush (ie. we missed the LR restore).
    
    Fix it by doing the patching under stop machine. The CPUs that aren't
    doing the patching will be spinning in the core of the stop machine
    logic. That is currently sufficient for our purposes, because none of
    the patching we do is to that code or anywhere in the vicinity.

    powerpc/64s: Fix crashes when toggling stf barrier
    
    commit 8ec7791bae1327b1c279c5cd6e929c3b12daaf0a upstream.
    
    The STF (store-to-load forwarding) barrier mitigation can be
    enabled/disabled at runtime via a debugfs file (stf_barrier), which
    causes the kernel to patch itself to enable/disable the relevant
    mitigations.
    
    However depending on which mitigation we're using, it may not be safe to
    do that patching while other CPUs are active. For example the following
    crash:

    ARC: entry: fix off-by-one error in syscall number validation
    
    commit 3433adc8bd09fc9f29b8baddf33b4ecd1ecd2cdc upstream.
    
    We have NR_syscall syscalls from [0 .. NR_syscall-1].
    However the check for invalid syscall number is "> NR_syscall" as
    opposed to >=. This off-by-one error erronesously allows "NR_syscall"
    to be treated as valid syscall causeing out-of-bounds access into
    syscall-call table ensuing a crash (holes within syscall table have a
    invalid-entry handler but this is beyond the array implementing the
    table).
    
    This problem showed up on v5.6 kernel when testing glibc 2.33 (v5.10
    kernel capable, includng faccessat2 syscall 439). The v5.6 kernel has
    NR_syscalls=439 (0 to 438). Due to the bug, 439 passed by glibc was
    not handled as -ENOSYS but processed leading to a crash.

    mptcp: fix splat when closing unaccepted socket
    
    [ Upstream commit 578c18eff1627d6a911f08f4cf351eca41fdcc7d ]
    
    If userspace exits before calling accept() on a listener that had at least
    one new connection ready, we get:
    
       Attempt to release TCP socket in state 8
    
    This happens because the mptcp socket gets cloned when the TCP connection
    is ready, but the socket is never exposed to userspace.
    
    The client additionally sends a DATA_FIN, which brings connection into
    CLOSE_WAIT state.  This in turn prevents the orphan+state reset fixup
    in mptcp_sock_destruct() from doing its job.
    
    Fixes: 3721b9b64676b ("mptcp: Track received DATA_FIN sequence number and add related helpers")

    i40e: fix broken XDP support
    
    [ Upstream commit ae4393dfd472b194c90d75d2123105fb5ed59b04 ]
    
    Commit 12738ac4754e ("i40e: Fix sparse errors in i40e_txrx.c") broke
    XDP support in the i40e driver. That commit was fixing a sparse error
    in the code by introducing a new variable xdp_res instead of
    overloading this into the skb pointer. The problem is that the code
    later uses the skb pointer in if statements and these where not
    extended to also test for the new xdp_res variable. Fix this by adding
    the correct tests for xdp_res in these places.
    
    The skb pointer was used to store the result of the XDP program by
    overloading the results in the error pointer
    ERR_PTR(-result). Therefore, the allocation failure test that used to
    only test for !skb now need to be extended to also consider !xdp_res.
    
    i40e_cleanup_headers() had a check that based on the skb value being
    an error pointer, i.e. a result from the XDP program != XDP_PASS, and
    if so start to process a new packet immediately, instead of populating
    skb fields and sending the skb to the stack. This check is not needed
    anymore, since we have added an explicit test for xdp_res being set
    and if so just do continue to pick the next packet from the NIC.

    kernel/resource: make walk_mem_res() find all busy IORESOURCE_MEM resources
    
    [ Upstream commit 3c9c797534364593b73ba6ab060a014af8934721 ]
    
    It used to be true that we can have system RAM (IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM |
    IORESOURCE_BUSY) only on the first level in the resource tree.  However,
    this is no longer holds for driver-managed system RAM (i.e., added via
    dax/kmem and virtio-mem), which gets added on lower levels, for example,
    inside device containers.
    
    IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM is defined as IORESOURCE_MEM | IORESOURCE_SYSRAM and
    just a special type of IORESOURCE_MEM.
    
    The function walk_mem_res() only considers the first level and is used in
    arch/x86/mm/ioremap.c:__ioremap_check_mem() only.  We currently fail to
    identify System RAM added by dax/kmem and virtio-mem as

    kernel/resource: make walk_system_ram_res() find all busy IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM resources
    
    [ Upstream commit 97f61c8f44ec9020708b97a51188170add4f3084 ]
    
    Patch series "kernel/resource: make walk_system_ram_res() and walk_mem_res() search the whole tree", v2.
    
    Playing with kdump+virtio-mem I noticed that kexec_file_load() does not
    consider System RAM added via dax/kmem and virtio-mem when preparing the
    elf header for kdump.  Looking into the details, the logic used in
    walk_system_ram_res() and walk_mem_res() seems to be outdated.
    
    walk_system_ram_range() already does the right thing, let's change
    walk_system_ram_res() and walk_mem_res(), and clean up.
    
    Loading a kdump kernel via "kexec -p -s" ...  will result in the kdump
    kernel to also dump dax/kmem and virtio-mem added System RAM now.
    
    Note: kexec-tools on x86-64 also have to be updated to consider this
    memory in the kexec_load() case when processing /proc/iomem.
    
    This patch (of 3):
    
    It used to be true that we can have system RAM (IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM |
    IORESOURCE_BUSY) only on the first level in the resource tree.  However,
    this is no longer holds for driver-managed system RAM (i.e., added via
    dax/kmem and virtio-mem), which gets added on lower levels, for example,
    inside device containers.
    
    We have two users of walk_system_ram_res(), which currently only
    consideres the first level:
    
    a) kernel/kexec_file.c:kexec_walk_resources() -- We properly skip
       IORESOURCE_SYSRAM_DRIVER_MANAGED resources via
       locate_mem_hole_callback(), so even after this change, we won't be
       placing kexec images onto dax/kmem and virtio-mem added memory.  No
       change.
    
    b) arch/x86/kernel/crash.c:fill_up_crash_elf_data() -- we're currently
       not adding relevant ranges to the crash elf header, resulting in them
       not getting dumped via kdump.
    
    This change fixes loading a crashkernel via kexec_file_load() and
    including dax/kmem and virtio-mem added System RAM in the crashdump on
    x86-64.  Note that e.g,, arm64 relies on memblock data and, therefore,
    always considers all added System RAM already.
    
    Let's find all IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM | IORESOURCE_BUSY resources, making
    the function behave like walk_system_ram_range().

    sched/fair: Fix unfairness caused by missing load decay
    
    [ Upstream commit 0258bdfaff5bd13c4d2383150b7097aecd6b6d82 ]
    
    This fixes an issue where old load on a cfs_rq is not properly decayed,
    resulting in strange behavior where fairness can decrease drastically.
    Real workloads with equally weighted control groups have ended up
    getting a respective 99% and 1%(!!) of cpu time.
    
    When an idle task is attached to a cfs_rq by attaching a pid to a cgroup,
    the old load of the task is attached to the new cfs_rq and sched_entity by
    attach_entity_cfs_rq. If the task is then moved to another cpu (and
    therefore cfs_rq) before being enqueued/woken up, the load will be moved
    to cfs_rq->removed from the sched_entity. Such a move will happen when
    enforcing a cpuset on the task (eg. via a cgroup) that force it to move.
    
    The load will however not be removed from the task_group itself, making
    it look like there is a constant load on that cfs_rq. This causes the
    vruntime of tasks on other sibling cfs_rq's to increase faster than they
    are supposed to; causing severe fairness issues. If no other task is
    started on the given cfs_rq, and due to the cpuset it would not happen,
    this load would never be properly unloaded. With this patch the load
    will be properly removed inside update_blocked_averages. This also
    applies to tasks moved to the fair scheduling class and moved to another
    cpu, and this path will also fix that. For fork, the entity is queued
    right away, so this problem does not affect that.
    
    This applies to cases where the new process is the first in the cfs_rq,
    issue introduced 3d30544f0212 ("sched/fair: Apply more PELT fixes"), and
    when there has previously been load on the cgroup but the cgroup was
    removed from the leaflist due to having null PELT load, indroduced
    in 039ae8bcf7a5 ("sched/fair: Fix O(nr_cgroups) in the load balancing
    path").
    
    For a simple cgroup hierarchy (as seen below) with two equally weighted
    groups, that in theory should get 50/50 of cpu time each, it often leads
    to a load of 60/40 or 70/30.
    
    parent/
      cg-1/
        cpu.weight: 100
        cpuset.cpus: 1
      cg-2/
        cpu.weight: 100
        cpuset.cpus: 1
    
    If the hierarchy is deeper (as seen below), while keeping cg-1 and cg-2
    equally weighted, they should still get a 50/50 balance of cpu time.
    This however sometimes results in a balance of 10/90 or 1/99(!!) between
    the task groups.
    
    $ ps u -C stress
    USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
    root       18568  1.1  0.0   3684   100 pts/12   R+   13:36   0:00 stress --cpu 1
    root       18580 99.3  0.0   3684   100 pts/12   R+   13:36   0:09 stress --cpu 1
    
    parent/
      cg-1/

        sub-group/
          cpu.weight: 10000
          cpuset.cpus: 1
    
    This can be reproduced by attaching an idle process to a cgroup and
    moving it to a given cpuset before it wakes up. The issue is evident in
    many (if not most) container runtimes, and has been reproduced
    with both crun and runc (and therefore docker and all its "derivatives"),
    and with both cgroup v1 and v2.

    sched: Fix out-of-bound access in uclamp
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d2f8909a5fabb73fe2a63918117943986c39b6c ]
    
    Util-clamp places tasks in different buckets based on their clamp values
    for performance reasons. However, the size of buckets is currently
    computed using a rounding division, which can lead to an off-by-one
    error in some configurations.
    
    For instance, with 20 buckets, the bucket size will be 1024/20=51. A
    task with a clamp of 1024 will be mapped to bucket id 1024/51=20. Sadly,
    correct indexes are in range [0,19], hence leading to an out of bound
    memory access.
    
    Clamp the bucket id to fix the issue.

    A TX complete IRQ might come in between and wake the queue, which

    Since 8ce8c0abcba3 the driver queues work via priv->restart_work when

    smc: disallow TCP_ULP in smc_setsockopt()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8621436671f3a4bba5db57482e1ee604708bf1eb ]
    
    syzbot is able to setup kTLS on an SMC socket which coincidentally
    uses sk_user_data too. Later, kTLS treats it as psock so triggers a
    refcnt warning. The root cause is that smc_setsockopt() simply calls
    TCP setsockopt() which includes TCP_ULP. I do not think it makes
    sense to setup kTLS on top of SMC sockets, so we should just disallow
    this setup.
    
    It is hard to find a commit to blame, but we can apply this patch
    since the beginning of TCP_ULP.

    kfence: await for allocation using wait_event
    
    [ Upstream commit 407f1d8c1b5f3ec66a6a3eb835d3b81c76440f4e ]
    
    Patch series "kfence: optimize timer scheduling", v2.
    
    We have observed that mostly-idle systems with KFENCE enabled wake up
    otherwise idle CPUs, preventing such to enter a lower power state.
    Debugging revealed that KFENCE spends too much active time in
    toggle_allocation_gate().
    
    While the first version of KFENCE was using all the right bits to be
    scheduling optimal, and thus power efficient, by simply using wait_event()
    + wake_up(), that code was unfortunately removed.
    
    As KFENCE was exposed to various different configs and tests, the
    scheduling optimal code slowly disappeared.  First because of hung task
    warnings, and finally because of deadlocks when an allocation is made by
    timer code with debug objects enabled.  Clearly, the "fixes" were not too
    friendly for devices that want to be power efficient.
    
    Therefore, let's try a little harder to fix the hung task and deadlock
    problems that we have with wait_event() + wake_up(), while remaining as
    scheduling friendly and power efficient as possible.
    
    Crucially, we need to defer the wake_up() to an irq_work, avoiding any
    potential for deadlock.
    
    The result with this series is that on the devices where we observed a
    power regression, power usage returns back to baseline levels.
    
    This patch (of 3):
    
    On mostly-idle systems, we have observed that toggle_allocation_gate() is
    a cause of frequent wake-ups, preventing an otherwise idle CPU to go into
    a lower power state.
    
    A late change in KFENCE's development, due to a potential deadlock [1],
    required changing the scheduling-friendly wait_event_timeout() and
    wake_up() to an open-coded wait-loop using schedule_timeout().  [1]
    https://lkml.kernel.org/r/000000000000c0645805b7f982e4@google.com
    
    To avoid unnecessary wake-ups, switch to using wait_event_timeout().
    
    Unfortunately, we still cannot use a version with direct wake_up() in
    __kfence_alloc() due to the same potential for deadlock as in [1].
    Instead, add a level of indirection via an irq_work that is scheduled if
    we determine that the kfence_timer requires a wake_up().

    mm/gup: check every subpage of a compound page during isolation
    
    [ Upstream commit 83c02c23d0747a7bdcd71f99a538aacec94b146c ]
    
    When pages are isolated in check_and_migrate_movable_pages() we skip
    compound number of pages at a time.  However, as Jason noted, it is not
    necessary correct that pages[i] corresponds to the pages that we
    skipped.  This is because it is possible that the addresses in this
    range had split_huge_pmd()/split_huge_pud(), and these functions do not
    update the compound page metadata.
    
    The problem can be reproduced if something like this occurs:
    
    1. User faulted huge pages.
    2. split_huge_pmd() was called for some reason
    3. User has unmapped some sub-pages in the range
    4. User tries to longterm pin the addresses.
    
    The resulting pages[i] might end-up having pages which are not compound
    size page aligned.

    ksm: fix potential missing rmap_item for stable_node
    
    [ Upstream commit c89a384e2551c692a9fe60d093fd7080f50afc51 ]
    
    When removing rmap_item from stable tree, STABLE_FLAG of rmap_item is
    cleared with head reserved.  So the following scenario might happen: For
    ksm page with rmap_item1:
    
    cmp_and_merge_page
      stable_node->head = &migrate_nodes;
      remove_rmap_item_from_tree, but head still equal to stable_node;
      try_to_merge_with_ksm_page failed;
      return;
    
    For the same ksm page with rmap_item2, stable node migration succeed this
    time.  The stable_node->head does not equal to migrate_nodes now.  For ksm
    page with rmap_item1 again:
    
    cmp_and_merge_page
     stable_node->head != &migrate_nodes && rmap_item->head == stable_node
     return;
    
    We would miss the rmap_item for stable_node and might result in failed
    rmap_walk_ksm().  Fix this by set rmap_item->head to NULL when rmap_item
    is removed from stable tree.

    arm64: entry: always set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET during entry
    
    [ Upstream commit 4d6a38da8e79e94cbd1344aa90876f0f805db705 ]
    
    Zenghui reports that booting a kernel with "irqchip.gicv3_pseudo_nmi=1"
    on the command line hits a warning during kernel entry, due to the way
    we manipulate the PMR.
    
    Early in the entry sequence, we call lockdep_hardirqs_off() to inform
    lockdep that interrupts have been masked (as the HW sets DAIF wqhen
    entering an exception). Architecturally PMR_EL1 is not affected by
    exception entry, and we don't set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in the PMR early in
    the exception entry sequence, so early in exception entry the PMR can
    indicate that interrupts are unmasked even though they are masked by
    DAIF.
    
    If DEBUG_LOCKDEP is selected, lockdep_hardirqs_off() will check that
    interrupts are masked, before we set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in any of the
    exception entry paths, and hence lockdep_hardirqs_off() will WARN() that
    something is amiss.
    
    We can avoid this by consistently setting GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET during
    exception entry so that kernel code sees a consistent environment. We
    must also update local_daif_inherit() to undo this, as currently only
    touches DAIF. For other paths, local_daif_restore() will update both
    DAIF and the PMR. With this done, we can remove the existing special
    cases which set this later in the entry code.
    
    We always use (GIC_PRIO_IRQON | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET) for consistency with
    local_daif_save(), as this will warn if it ever encounters
    (GIC_PRIO_IRQOFF | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET), and never sets this itself. This
    matches the gic_prio_kentry_setup that we have to retain for
    ret_to_user.

    arm64: entry: factor irq triage logic into macros
    
    [ Upstream commit 9eb563cdabe1d583c262042d5d44cc256f644543 ]
    
    In subsequent patches we'll allow an FIQ handler to be registered, and
    FIQ exceptions will need to be triaged very similarly to IRQ exceptions.
    So that we can reuse the existing logic, this patch factors the IRQ
    triage logic out into macros that can be reused for FIQ.
    
    The macros are named to follow the elX_foo_handler scheme used by the C
    exception handlers. For consistency with other top-level exception
    handlers, the kernel_entry/kernel_exit logic is not moved into the
    macros. As FIQ will use a different C handler, this handler name is
    provided as an argument to the macros.
    
    There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.

    xsk: Fix for xp_aligned_validate_desc() when len == chunk_size
    
    [ Upstream commit ac31565c21937eee9117e43c9cd34f557f6f1cb8 ]
    
    When desc->len is equal to chunk_size, it is legal. But when the
    xp_aligned_validate_desc() got chunk_end from desc->addr + desc->len
    pointing to the next chunk during the check, it caused the check to
    fail.
    
    This problem was first introduced in bbff2f321a86 ("xsk: new descriptor
    addressing scheme"). Later in 2b43470add8c ("xsk: Introduce AF_XDP buffer
    allocation API") this piece of code was moved into the new function called
    xp_aligned_validate_desc(). This function was then moved into xsk_queue.h
    via 26062b185eee ("xsk: Explicitly inline functions and move definitions").

    sctp: fix a SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB leak in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_b
    
    [ Upstream commit f282df0391267fb2b263da1cc3233aa6fb81defc ]
    
    Normally SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB is always incremented once asoc enter into
    ESTABLISHED from the state < ESTABLISHED and decremented when the asoc
    is being deleted.
    
    However, in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_b(), the asoc's state can be changed to
    ESTABLISHED from the state >= ESTABLISHED where it shouldn't increment
    SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB. Otherwise, one asoc may increment MIB_CURRESTAB
    multiple times but only decrement once at the end.
    
    I was able to reproduce it by using scapy to do the 4-way shakehands,
    after that I replayed the COOKIE-ECHO chunk with 'peer_vtag' field
    changed to different values, and SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB was incremented
    multiple times and never went back to 0 even when the asoc was freed.
    
    This patch is to fix it by only incrementing SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB when
    the state < ESTABLISHED in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_b().

    [ Upstream commit 643001b47adc844ae33510c4bb93c236667008a3 ]
    
    In enic_hard_start_xmit, it calls enic_queue_wq_skb(). Inside
    enic_queue_wq_skb, if some error happens, the skb will be freed
    by dev_kfree_skb(skb). But the freed skb is still used in
    skb_tx_timestamp(skb).

    PCI: brcmstb: Use reset/rearm instead of deassert/assert
    
    [ Upstream commit bb610757fcd74558ad94fe19993fd4470208dd02 ]
    
    The Broadcom STB PCIe RC uses a reset control "rescal" for certain chips.
    The "rescal" implements a "pulse reset" so using assert/deassert is wrong
    for this device.  Instead, we use reset/rearm.  We need to use rearm so
    that we can reset it after a suspend/resume cycle; w/o using "rearm", the
    "rescal" device will only ever fire once.
    
    Of course for suspend/resume to work we also need to put the reset/rearm
    calls in the suspend and resume routines.

    [ Upstream commit e8d6f9e56187c101b325e8d18f1d4032420d08ff ]
    
    This driver may use one of two resets controllers.  Keep them in separate
    variables to keep things simple.  The reset controller "rescal" is shared
    between the AHCI driver and the PCIe driver for the BrcmSTB 7216 chip.  Use
    devm_reset_control_get_optional_shared() to handle this sharing.

    [ Upstream commit 2a30f9440640c418bcfbea9b2b344d268b58e0a2 ]
    
    One of our benchmarks running in (Google-internal) CI pushes data
    through the ringbuf faster htan than userspace is able to consume
    it. In this case it seems we're actually able to get >INT_MAX entries
    in a single ring_buffer__consume() call. ASAN detected that cnt
    overflows in this case.
    
    Fix by using 64-bit counter internally and then capping the result to
    INT_MAX before converting to the int return type. Do the same for
    the ring_buffer__poll().

    sunrpc: Fix misplaced barrier in call_decode

    Fix a misplaced barrier in call_decode. The struct rpc_rqst is modified
    as follows by xprt_complete_rqst:
    
    req->rq_private_buf.len = copied;
    /* Ensure all writes are done before we update */
    /* req->rq_reply_bytes_recvd */
    smp_wmb();
    req->rq_reply_bytes_recvd = copied;
    
    And currently read as follows by call_decode:
    
    smp_rmb(); // misplaced
    if (!req->rq_reply_bytes_recvd)
       goto out;
    req->rq_rcv_buf.len = req->rq_private_buf.len;
    
    This patch places the smp_rmb after the if to ensure that

    sctp: do asoc update earlier in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a
    
    [ Upstream commit 35b4f24415c854cd718ccdf38dbea6297f010aae ]
    
    There's a panic that occurs in a few of envs, the call trace is as below:
    
      [] general protection fault, ... 0x29acd70f1000a: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI
      [] RIP: 0010:sctp_ulpevent_notify_peer_addr_change+0x4b/0x1fa [sctp]

      []  sctp_generate_timeout_event+0x81/0xf0 [sctp]
    
    This is caused by a transport use-after-free issue. When processing a
    duplicate COOKIE-ECHO chunk in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a(), both COOKIE-ACK
    and SHUTDOWN chunks are allocated with the transort from the new asoc.
    However, later in the sideeffect machine, the old asoc is used to send
    them out and old asoc's shutdown_last_sent_to is set to the transport
    that SHUTDOWN chunk attached to in sctp_cmd_setup_t2(), which actually
    belongs to the new asoc. After the new_asoc is freed and the old asoc
    T2 timeout, the old asoc's shutdown_last_sent_to that is already freed
    would be accessed in sctp_sf_t2_timer_expire().
    
    Thanks Alexander and Jere for helping dig into this issue.
    
    To fix it, this patch is to do the asoc update first, then allocate
    the COOKIE-ACK and SHUTDOWN chunks with the 'updated' old asoc. This
    would make more sense, as a chunk from an asoc shouldn't be sent out
    with another asoc. We had fixed quite a few issues caused by this.

    Currently, netif_tx_stop_all_queues() is used to ensure that

    a flag without locking to indicate that the xmit queue(s)
    should not be run.
    
    So use netif_tx_disable() to replace netif_tx_stop_all_queues(),
    it takes the xmit queue lock while marking the queue stopped.

    [ Upstream commit 8533d5bfad41e74b7dd80d292fd484913cdfb374 ]
    
    We removed the terminal frame records in commit:
    
       6106e1112cc69a36 ("arm64: remove EL0 exception frame record")
    
    ... on the assumption that as we no longer used them to find the pt_regs
    at exception boundaries, they were no longer necessary.
    
    However, Leo reports that as an unintended side-effect, this causes
    traces which cross secondary_start_kernel to terminate one entry too
    late, with a spurious "0" entry.
    
    There are a few ways we could sovle this, but as we're planning to use
    terminal records for RELIABLE_STACKTRACE, let's revert the logic change
    for now, keeping the update comments and accounting for the changes in
    commit:

    scsi: ufs: core: Narrow down fast path in system suspend path
    
    [ Upstream commit ce4f62f9dd8cf43ac044045ed598a0b80ef33890 ]
    
    If spm_lvl is set to 0 or 1, when system suspend kicks start and HBA is
    runtime active, system suspend may just bail without doing anything (the
    fast path), leaving other contexts still running, e.g., clock gating and
    clock scaling. When system resume kicks start, concurrency can happen
    between ufshcd_resume() and these contexts, leading to various stability
    issues.
    
    Add a check against HBA's runtime state and allowing fast path only if HBA
    is runtime suspended, otherwise let system suspend go ahead call
    ufshcd_suspend(). This will guarantee that these contexts are stopped by
    either runtime suspend or system suspend.

    scsi: ufs: core: Cancel rpm_dev_flush_recheck_work during system suspend
    
    [ Upstream commit 637822e63b79ee8a729f7ba2645a26cf5a524ee4 ]
    
    During ufs system suspend, leaving rpm_dev_flush_recheck_work running or
    pending is risky because concurrency may happen between system
    suspend/resume and runtime resume routine. Fix this by cancelling
    rpm_dev_flush_recheck_work synchronously during system suspend.

    scsi: qla2xxx: Prevent PRLI in target mode
    
    [ Upstream commit fcb16d9a8ecf1e9bfced0fc654ea4e2caa7517f4 ]
    
    In a case when the initiator in P2P mode by some circumstances does not
    send PRLI, the target, in a case when the target port's WWPN is less than
    initiator's, changes the discovery state in DSC_GNL. When gnl completes it
    sends PRLI to the initiator.
    
    Usually the initiator in P2P mode always sends PRLI. We caught this issue
    on Linux stable v5.4.6 https://www.spinics.net/lists/stable/msg458515.html.
    
    Fix this particular corner case in the behaviour of the P2P mod target
    login state machine.

    [ Upstream commit 35d8b10a25884050bb3b0149b62c3818ec59f77c ]
    
    After a reconnect, the reply handler is opening the cwnd (and thus
    enabling more RPC Calls to be sent) /before/ rpcrdma_post_recvs()
    can post enough Receive WRs to receive their replies. This causes an
    RNR and the new connection is lost immediately.
    
    The race is most clearly exposed when KASAN and disconnect injection
    are enabled. This slows down rpcrdma_rep_create() enough to allow
    the send side to post a bunch of RPC Calls before the Receive
    completion handler can invoke ib_post_recv().

    This code is supposed to pass negative "err" values for tracing but it
    passes positive values instead.  The problem is that the
    trace_svcsock_tcp_send() function takes a long but "err" is an int and
    "sent" is a u32.  The negative is first type promoted to u32 so it
    becomes a high positive then it is promoted to long and it stays
    positive.
    
    Fix this by casting "err" directly to long.

    [ Upstream commit 04922b7445a1950b86f130a1fe8c52cc27b3e30b ]
    
    The char device setup and cleanup has device lifetime issues regarding when
    parts are initialized and cleaned up. The initialization of struct device is
    done incorrectly. device_initialize() needs to be called on the 'struct
    device' and then additional changes can be added. The ->release() function
    needs to be setup via device_type before dev_set_name() to allow proper
    cleanup. The change re-parents the cdev under the wq->conf_dev to get
    natural reference inheritance. No known dependency on the old device path exists.

    SUNRPC: Handle major timeout in xprt_adjust_timeout()
    
    [ Upstream commit 09252177d5f924f404551b4b4eded5daa7f04a3a ]
    
    Currently if a major timeout value is reached, but the minor value has
    not been reached, an ETIMEOUT will not be sent back to the caller.
    This can occur if the v4 server is not responding to requests and
    retrans is configured larger than the default of two.
    
    For example, A TCP mount with a configured timeout value of 50 and a
    retransmission count of 3 to a v4 server which is not responding:
    
    1. Initial value and increment set to 5s, maxval set to 20s, retries at 3
    2. Major timeout is set to 20s, minor timeout set to 5s initially
    3. xport_adjust_timeout() is called after 5s, retry with 10s timeout,
       minor timeout is bumped to 10s
    4. And again after another 10s, 15s total time with minor timeout set
       to 15s
    5. After 20s total time xport_adjust_timeout is called as major timeout is
       reached, but skipped because the minor timeout is not reached
           - After this time the cpu spins continually calling
             xport_adjust_timeout() and returning 0 for 10 seconds.
             As seen on perf sched:
             39243.913182 [0005]  mount.nfs[3794] 4607.938      0.017   9746.863
    6. This continues until the 15s minor timeout condition is reached (in
       this case for 10 seconds). After which the ETIMEOUT is processed
       back to the caller, the cpu spinning stops, and normal operations
       continue

    I've hit some crashes that occur in the xprt_rdma_inject_disconnect
    path. It appears that, for some provides, rdma_disconnect() can
    take so long that the transport can disconnect and release its
    hardware resources while rdma_disconnect() is still running,
    resulting in a UAF in the provider.
    
    The transport's fault injection method may depend on the stability
    of transport data structures. That means it needs to be invoked
    only from contexts that hold the transport write lock.

    We (adam zabrocki, alexander matrosov, alexander tereshkin, maksym
    bazalii) observed the check:
    
            if (fh->size > sizeof(struct nfs_fh))
    
    should not use the size of the nfs_fh struct which includes an extra two

            unsigned char          data[NFS_MAXFHSIZE];
    }
    
    but should determine the size from data[NFS_MAXFHSIZE] so the memcpy
    will not write 2 bytes beyond destination.  The proposed fix is to
    compare against the NFS_MAXFHSIZE directly, as is done elsewhere in fs

    remoteproc: pru: Fix and cleanup firmware interrupt mapping logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 880a66e026fbe6a17cd59fe0ee942bbad62a6c26 ]
    
    The PRU firmware interrupt mappings are configured and unconfigured in
    .start() and .stop() callbacks respectively using the variables 'evt_count'
    and a 'mapped_irq' pointer. These variables are modified only during these
    callbacks but are not re-initialized/reset properly during unwind or
    failure paths. These stale values caused a kernel crash while stopping a
    PRU remoteproc running a different firmware with no events on a subsequent
    run after a previous run that was running a firmware with events.
    
    Fix this crash by ensuring that the evt_count is 0 and the mapped_irq
    pointer is set to NULL in pru_dispose_irq_mapping(). Also, reset these
    variables properly during any failures in the .start() callback. While
    at this, the pru_dispose_irq_mapping() callsites are all made to look
    the same, moving any conditional logic to inside the function.

    [ Upstream commit 6d1f2803cb6b414c2e45fa64d1fdad6b581e1e88 ]
    
    The PRU firmware interrupt mapping logic in pru_handle_intrmap() uses
    of_irq_find_parent() with PRU device node to get a handle to the PRUSS
    Interrupt Controller at present. This logic however requires that the
    PRU nodes always define a interrupt-parent property. This property is
    neither a required/defined property as per the PRU remoteproc binding,
    nor is relevant from a DT node point of view without any associated
    interrupts. The current logic finds a wrong interrupt controller and
    fails to perform proper mapping without any interrupt-parent property
    in the PRU nodes.
    
    Fix this logic to always find and use the sibling interrupt controller.
    Also, while at this, fix the acquired interrupt controller device node
    reference properly.

    The cached NFSv3/v4 readdir cookies are associated with a verifier,
    which is checked by the server on subsequent calls to readdir, and is
    only expected to change when the cookies (and hence also the page cache

    f2fs: Fix a hungtask problem in atomic write
    
    [ Upstream commit be1ee45d51384161681ecf21085a42d316ae25f7 ]
    
    In the cache writing process, if it is an atomic file, increase the page
    count of F2FS_WB_CP_DATA, otherwise increase the page count of
    F2FS_WB_DATA.
    
    When you step into the hook branch due to insufficient memory in
    f2fs_write_begin, f2fs_drop_inmem_pages_all will be called to traverse
    all atomic inodes and clear the FI_ATOMIC_FILE mark of all atomic files.
    
    In f2fs_drop_inmem_pages，first acquire the inmem_lock , revoke all the
    inmem_pages, and then clear the FI_ATOMIC_FILE mark. Before this mark is
    cleared, other threads may hold inmem_lock to add inmem_pages to the inode
    that has just been emptied inmem_pages, and increase the page count of
    F2FS_WB_CP_DATA.
    
    When the IO returns, it is found that the FI_ATOMIC_FILE flag is cleared
    by f2fs_drop_inmem_pages_all, and f2fs_is_atomic_file returns false,which
    causes the page count of F2FS_WB_DATA to be decremented. The page count of
    F2FS_WB_CP_DATA cannot be cleared. Finally, hungtask is triggered in
    f2fs_wait_on_all_pages because get_pages will never return zero.
    
    process A:                              process B:
    f2fs_drop_inmem_pages_all
    ->f2fs_drop_inmem_pages of inode#1

                                                        ->do_write_page
                                                            ->f2fs_submit_page_write
                                                                ->inc_page_count(sbi, F2FS_WB_CP_DATA )
                                            ->mutex_unlock(&fi->inmem_lock)
        ->spin_lock(&sbi->inode_lock[ATOMIC_FILE]);
        ->clear_inode_flag(inode, FI_ATOMIC_FILE)
        ->spin_unlock(&sbi->inode_lock[ATOMIC_FILE])
                                            f2fs_write_end_io
                                            ->dec_page_count(sbi, F2FS_WB_DATA );
    
    We can fix the problem by putting the action of clearing the FI_ATOMIC_FILE
    mark into the inmem_lock lock. This operation can ensure that no one will
    submit the inmem pages before the FI_ATOMIC_FILE mark is cleared, so that
    there will be no atomic writes waiting for writeback.

    [ Upstream commit 61461fc921b756ae16e64243f72af2bfc2e620db ]
    
    In CP disabling mode, there are two issues when using LFS or SSR | AT_SSR
    mode to select victim:
    
    1. LFS is set to find source section during GC, the victim should have
    no checkpointed data, since after GC, section could not be set free for
    reuse.
    
    Previously, we only check valid chpt blocks in current segment rather
    than section, fix it.
    
    2. SSR | AT_SSR are set to find target segment for writes which can be
    fully filled by checkpointed and newly written blocks, we should never
    select such segment, otherwise it can cause panic or data corruption
    during allocation, potential case is described as below:
    
     a) target segment has 'n' (n < 512) ckpt valid blocks
     b) GC migrates 'n' valid blocks to other segment (segment is still
        in dirty list)
     c) GC migrates '512 - n' blocks to target segment (segment has 'n'
        cp_vblocks and '512 - n' vblocks)
     d) If GC selects target segment via {AT,}SSR allocator, however there
        is no free space in targe segment.

    PCI: endpoint: Fix NULL pointer dereference for ->get_features()
    
    [ Upstream commit 6613bc2301ba291a1c5a90e1dc24cf3edf223c03 ]
    
    get_features ops of pci_epc_ops may return NULL, causing NULL pointer
    dereference in pci_epf_test_alloc_space function. Let us add a check for

    pci_epc_feature is not found.

    [ Upstream commit e1175f02291141bbd924fc578299305fcde35855 ]
    
    Now, fallocate() on a pinned file only allocates blocks which aligns
    to segment rather than section, so GC may try to migrate pinned file's
    block, and after several times of failure, pinned file's block could
    be migrated to other place, however user won't be aware of such
    condition, and then old obsolete block address may be readed/written
    incorrectly.
    
    To avoid such condition, let's try to allocate pinned file's blocks
    with section alignment.

    ARM: 9064/1: hw_breakpoint: Do not directly check the event's overflow_handler hook
    
    [ Upstream commit a506bd5756290821a4314f502b4bafc2afcf5260 ]
    
    The commit 1879445dfa7b ("perf/core: Set event's default
    ::overflow_handler()") set a default event->overflow_handler in
    perf_event_alloc(), and replace the check event->overflow_handler with
    is_default_overflow_handler(), but one is missing.
    
    Currently, the bp->overflow_handler can not be NULL. As a result,
    enable_single_step() is always not invoked.

    [ Upstream commit d9b7eae8e3424c3480fe9f40ebafbb0c96426e4c ]
    
    rcec_assoc_rciep() used "rciep->devfn" (a single byte encoding both the
    device and function number) as the device number to check whether the
    corresponding bit was set in the RCEC's Association Bitmap for RCiEPs.
    
    But per PCIe r5.0, sec 7.9.10.2, "Association Bitmap for RCiEPs", the
    32-bit bitmap contains one bit per device.  That bit applies to all
    functions of the device.
    
    Fix rcec_assoc_rciep() to convert the value of "rciep->devfn" to a device
    number to ensure that RCiEP devices are correctly associated with the RCEC.

    watchdog/softlockup: remove logic that tried to prevent repeated reports
    
    [ Upstream commit 1bc503cb4a2638fb1c57801a7796aca57845ce63 ]
    
    The softlockup detector does some gymnastic with the variable
    soft_watchdog_warn.  It was added by the commit 58687acba59266735ad
    ("lockup_detector: Combine nmi_watchdog and softlockup detector").
    
    The purpose is not completely clear.  There are the following clues.  They
    describe the situation how it looked after the above mentioned commit:
    
      1. The variable was checked with a comment "only warn once".
    
      2. The variable was set when softlockup was reported. It was cleared
         only when the CPU was not longer in the softlockup state.
    
      3. watchdog_touch_ts was not explicitly updated when the softlockup
         was reported. Without this variable, the report would normally
         be printed again during every following watchdog_timer_fn()
         invocation.
    
    The logic has got even more tangled up by the commit ed235875e2ca98
    ("kernel/watchdog.c: print traces for all cpus on lockup detection").
    After this commit, soft_watchdog_warn is set only when
    softlockup_all_cpu_backtrace is enabled.  But multiple reports from all
    CPUs are prevented by a new variable soft_lockup_nmi_warn.
    
    Conclusion:
    
    The variable probably never worked as intended.  In each case, it has not
    worked last many years because the softlockup was reported repeatedly
    after the full period defined by watchdog_thresh.
    
    The reason is that watchdog gets touched in many known slow paths, for
    example, in printk_stack_address().  This code is called also when
    printing the softlockup report.  It means that the watchdog timestamp gets
    updated after each report.
    
    Solution:
    
    Simply remove the logic. People want the periodic report anyway.

    watchdog/softlockup: report the overall time of softlockups
    
    [ Upstream commit fef06efc2ebaa94c8aee299b863e870467dbab8d ]
    
    The softlockup detector currently shows the time spent since the last
    report.  As a result it is not clear whether a CPU is infinitely hogged by
    a single task or if it is a repeated event.
    
    The situation can be simulated with a simply busy loop:
    
            while (true)
                  cpu_relax();
    
    The softlockup detector produces:
    
    [  168.277520] watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#1 stuck for 22s! [cat:4865]
    [  196.277604] watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#1 stuck for 22s! [cat:4865]
    [  236.277522] watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#1 stuck for 23s! [cat:4865]
    
    But it should be, something like:
    
    [  480.372418] watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#2 stuck for 26s! [cat:4943]
    [  508.372359] watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#2 stuck for 52s! [cat:4943]
    [  548.372359] watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#2 stuck for 89s! [cat:4943]
    [  576.372351] watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#2 stuck for 115s! [cat:4943]
    
    For the better output, add an additional timestamp of the last report.
    Only this timestamp is reset when the watchdog is intentionally touched
    from slow code paths or when printing the report.

    watchdog: explicitly update timestamp when reporting softlockup
    
    [ Upstream commit c9ad17c991492f4390f42598f6ab0531f87eed07 ]
    
    The softlockup situation might stay for a long time or even forever.  When
    it happens, the softlockup debug messages are printed in regular intervals
    defined by get_softlockup_thresh().
    
    There is a mystery.  The repeated message is printed after the full
    interval that is defined by get_softlockup_thresh().  But the timer
    callback is called more often as defined by sample_period.  The code looks
    like the soflockup should get reported in every sample_period when it was
    once behind the thresh.
    
    It works only by chance.  The watchdog is touched when printing the stall
    report, for example, in printk_stack_address().
    
    Make the behavior clear and predictable by explicitly updating the
    timestamp in watchdog_timer_fn() when the report gets printed.

    watchdog: rename __touch_watchdog() to a better descriptive name
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c0012f522c802d25be102bafe54f333168e6119 ]
    
    Patch series "watchdog/softlockup: Report overall time and some cleanup", v2.
    
    I dug deep into the softlockup watchdog history when time permitted this
    year.  And reworked the patchset that fixed timestamps and cleaned up the
    code[2].
    
    I split it into very small steps and did even more code clean up.  The
    result looks quite strightforward and I am pretty confident with the
    changes.
    
    [1] v2: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20201210160038.31441-1-pmladek@suse.com
    [2] v1: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20191024114928.15377-1-pmladek@suse.com
    
    This patch (of 6):
    
    There are many touch_*watchdog() functions.  They are called in situations
    where the watchdog could report false positives or create unnecessary
    noise.  For example, when CPU is entering idle mode, a virtual machine is
    stopped, or a lot of messages are printed in the atomic context.
    
    These functions set SOFTLOCKUP_RESET instead of a real timestamp.  It
    allows to call them even in a context where jiffies might be outdated.
    For example, in an atomic context.
    
    The real timestamp is set by __touch_watchdog() that is called from the
    watchdog timer callback.
    
    Rename this callback to update_touch_ts().  It better describes the effect
    and clearly distinguish is from the other touch_*watchdog() functions.
    
    Another motivation is that two timestamps are going to be used.  One will
    be used for the total softlockup time.  The other will be used to measure
    time since the last report.  The new function name will help to
    distinguish which timestamp is being updated.

    ia64: module: fix symbolizer crash on fdescr
    
    [ Upstream commit 99e729bd40fb3272fa4b0140839d5e957b58588a ]
    
    Noticed failure as a crash on ia64 when tried to symbolize all backtraces
    collected by page_owner=on:

        <oops>

        ip is at dereference_module_function_descriptor+0x41/0x100
    
    Crash happens at dereference_module_function_descriptor() due to
    use-after-free when dereferencing ".opd" section header.
    
    All section headers are already freed after module is laoded successfully.
    
    To keep symbolizer working the change stores ".opd" address and size after
    module is relocated to a new place and before section headers are
    discarded.
    
    To make similar errors less obscure module_finalize() now zeroes out all
    variables relevant to module loading only.

    kbuild: generate Module.symvers only when vmlinux exists
    
    [ Upstream commit 69bc8d386aebbd91a6bb44b6d33f77c8dfa9ed8c ]
    
    The external module build shows the following warning if Module.symvers
    is missing in the kernel tree.
    
      WARNING: Symbol version dump "Module.symvers" is missing.
               Modules may not have dependencies or modversions.
    
    I think this is an important heads-up because the resulting modules may
    not work as expected. This happens when you did not build the entire
    kernel tree, for example, you might have prepared the minimal setups
    for external modules by 'make defconfig && make modules_preapre'.
    
    A problem is that 'make modules' creates Module.symvers even without
    vmlinux. In this case, that warning is suppressed since Module.symvers
    already exists in spite of its incomplete content.
    
    The incomplete (i.e. invalid) Module.symvers should not be created.
    
    This commit changes the second pass of modpost to dump symbols into
    modules-only.symvers. The final Module.symvers is created by
    concatenating vmlinux.symvers and modules-only.symvers if both exist.
    
    Module.symvers is supposed to collect symbols from both vmlinux and
    modules. It might be a bit confusing, and I am not quite sure if it
    is an official interface, but presumably it is difficult to rename it
    because some tools (e.g. kmod) parse it.

    selftests: mlxsw: Fix mausezahn invocation in ERSPAN scale test
    
    [ Upstream commit 1233898ab758cbcf5f6fea10b8dd16a0b2c24fab ]
    
    The mirror_gre_scale test creates as many ERSPAN sessions as the underlying
    chip supports, and tests that they all work. In order to determine that it
    issues a stream of ICMP packets and checks if they are mirrored as
    expected.
    
    However, the mausezahn invocation missed the -6 flag to identify the use of
    IPv6 protocol, and was sending ICMP messages over IPv6, as opposed to
    ICMP6. It also didn't pass an explicit source IP address, which apparently
    worked at some point in the past, but does not anymore.
    
    To fix these issues, extend the function mirror_test() in mirror_lib by
    detecting the IPv6 protocol addresses, and using a different ICMP scheme.
    Fix __mirror_gre_test() in the selftest itself to pass a source IP address.

    selftests: mlxsw: Increase the tolerance of backlog buildup
    
    [ Upstream commit dda7f4fa55839baeb72ae040aeaf9ccf89d3e416 ]
    
    The intention behind this test is to make sure that qdisc limit is
    correctly projected to the HW. However, first, due to rounding in the
    qdisc, and then in the driver, the number cannot actually be accurate. And
    second, the approach to testing this is to oversubscribe the port with
    traffic generated on the same switch. The actual backlog size therefore
    fluctuates.
    
    In practice, this test proved to be noisier than the rest, and spuriously
    fails every now and then. Increase the tolerance to 10 % to avoid these
    issues.

    powerpc/iommu: Annotate nested lock for lockdep
    
    [ Upstream commit cc7130bf119add37f36238343a593b71ef6ecc1e ]
    
    The IOMMU table is divided into pools for concurrent mappings and each
    pool has a separate spinlock. When taking the ownership of an IOMMU group
    to pass through a device to a VM, we lock these spinlocks which triggers
    a false negative warning in lockdep (below).
    
    This fixes it by annotating the large pool's spinlock as a nest lock
    which makes lockdep not complaining when locking nested locks if
    the nest lock is locked already.

    The problem is that the original code is trying to copy data into a
    bunch of struct members adjacent to each other in a single call to
    memcpy(). Now that a new struct wl3501_req enclosing all those adjacent
    members is introduced, memcpy() doesn't overrun the length of
    &sig.beacon_period and &this->bss_set[i].beacon_period, because the
    address of the new struct object _req_ is used as the destination,
    instead.
    
    This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
    and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
    on memcpy().

    wl3501_cs: Fix out-of-bounds warnings in wl3501_send_pkt
    
    [ Upstream commit 820aa37638a252b57967bdf4038a514b1ab85d45 ]

    daddr and saddr into new struct addr, in structures wl3501_md_req and
    wl3501_md_ind:

    is used, instead.

    crypto: ccp: Free SEV device if SEV init fails
    
    [ Upstream commit b61a9071dc72a3c709192c0c00ab87c2b3de1d94 ]
    
    Free the SEV device if later initialization fails.  The memory isn't
    technically leaked as it's tracked in the top-level device's devres
    list, but unless the top-level device is removed, the memory won't be
    freed and is effectively leaked.

    [ Upstream commit 4ccf9446b2a3615615045346c97f8a1e2a16568a ]
    
    [why]
    the current implementation of hdcp2 rx id list validation does not
    have handler/checker for invalid message status, e.g. HMAC, the V
    parameter calculated from PSP not matching the V prime from Rx.
    
    [how]
    return a generic FAILURE for any message status not SUCCESS or
    REVOKED.

    drm/amd/display: fixed divide by zero kernel crash during dsc enablement
    
    [ Upstream commit 19cc1f3829567e7dca21c1389ea6407b8f5efab4 ]
    
    [why]
    During dsc enable, a divide by zero condition triggered the
    kernel crash.
    
    [how]
    An IGT test, which enable the DSC, was crashing at the time of
    restore the default dsc status, becaue of h_totals value
    becoming 0. So add a check before divide condition. If h_total
    is zero, gracefully ignore and set the default value.

    ethtool: ioctl: Fix out-of-bounds warning in store_link_ksettings_for_user()
    
    [ Upstream commit c1d9e34e11281a8ba1a1c54e4db554232a461488 ]
    
    Fix the following out-of-bounds warning:
    
    net/ethtool/ioctl.c:492:2: warning: 'memcpy' offset [49, 84] from the object at 'link_usettings' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'base' with type 'struct ethtool_link_settings' at offset 0 [-Warray-bounds]
    
    The problem is that the original code is trying to copy data into a
    some struct members adjacent to each other in a single call to
    memcpy(). This causes a legitimate compiler warning because memcpy()
    overruns the length of &link_usettings.base. Fix this by directly
    using &link_usettings and _from_ as destination and source addresses,
    instead.
    
    This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
    and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
    on memcpy().

    ASoC: rt286: Generalize support for ALC3263 codec
    
    [ Upstream commit aa2f9c12821e6a4ba1df4fb34a3dbc6a2a1ee7fe ]
    
    The ALC3263 codec on the XPS 13 9343 is also found on the Latitude 13 7350
    and Venue 11 Pro 7140. They require the same handling for the combo jack to
    work with a headset: GPIO pin 6 must be set.
    
    The HDA driver always sets this pin on the ALC3263, which it distinguishes
    by the codec vendor/device ID 0x10ec0288 and PCI subsystem vendor ID 0x1028
    (Dell). The ASoC driver does not use PCI, so adapt this check to use DMI to
    determine if Dell is the system vendor.

    wilc1000: Bring MAC address setting in line with typical Linux behavior
    
    [ Upstream commit a381b78a1598dde34a6e40dae2842024308a6ef2 ]
    
    Linux network drivers normally disallow changing the MAC address when
    the interface is up.  This driver has been different in that it allows
    to change the MAC address *only* when it's up.  This patch brings
    wilc1000 behavior more in line with other network drivers.  We could
    have replaced wilc_set_mac_addr() with eth_mac_addr() but that would
    break existing documentation on how to change the MAC address.
    Likewise, return -EADDRNOTAVAIL (not -EINVAL) when the specified MAC
    address is invalid or unavailable.

    Some of the per-CPU masks use cpu_cpu_mask as a filter to limit the search
    for related CPUs. On a dlpar add of a CPU, update cpu_cpu_mask before
    updating the per-CPU masks. This will ensure the cpu_cpu_mask is updated
    correctly before its used in setting the masks. Setting the numa_node will
    ensure that when cpu_cpu_mask() gets called, the correct node number is
    used. This code movement helped fix the above call trace.

    powerpc/xive: Use the "ibm, chip-id" property only under PowerNV
    
    [ Upstream commit e9e16917bc388846163b8566a298a291d71e44c9 ]
    
    The 'chip_id' field of the XIVE CPU structure is used to choose a
    target for a source located on the same chip. For that, the XIVE
    driver queries the chip identifier from the "ibm,chip-id" property
    and compares it to a 'src_chip' field identifying the chip of a
    source. This information is only available on the PowerNV platform,
    'src_chip' being assigned to XIVE_INVALID_CHIP_ID under pSeries.
    
    The "ibm,chip-id" property is also not available on all platforms. It
    was first introduced on PowerNV and later, under QEMU for pSeries/KVM.
    However, the property is not part of PAPR and does not exist under
    pSeries/PowerVM.
    
    Assign 'chip_id' to XIVE_INVALID_CHIP_ID by default and let the
    PowerNV platform override the value with the "ibm,chip-id" property.

    flow_dissector: Fix out-of-bounds warning in __skb_flow_bpf_to_target()
    
    [ Upstream commit 1e3d976dbb23b3fce544752b434bdc32ce64aabc ]
    
    Fix the following out-of-bounds warning:
    
    net/core/flow_dissector.c:835:3: warning: 'memcpy' offset [33, 48] from the object at 'flow_keys' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'ipv6_src' with type '__u32[4]' {aka 'unsigned int[4]'} at offset 16 [-Warray-bounds]
    
    The problem is that the original code is trying to copy data into a
    couple of struct members adjacent to each other in a single call to
    memcpy().  So, the compiler legitimately complains about it. As these
    are just a couple of members, fix this by copying each one of them in
    separate calls to memcpy().
    
    This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
    and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
    on memcpy().

    ALSA: hda/hdmi: fix race in handling acomp ELD notification at resume
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c37e2eb6b83e375e8a654d01598292d5591fc65 ]
    
    When snd-hda-codec-hdmi is used with ASoC HDA controller like SOF (acomp
    used for ELD notifications), display connection change done during suspend,
    can be lost due to following sequence of events:
    
      1. system in S3 suspend
      2. DP/HDMI receiver connected
      3. system resumed
      4. HDA controller resumed, but card->deferred_resume_work not complete
      5. acomp eld_notify callback
      6. eld_notify ignored as power state is not CTL_POWER_D0
      7. HDA resume deferred work completed, power state set to CTL_POWER_D0
    
    This results in losing the notification, and the jack state reported to
    user-space is not correct.
    
    The check on step 6 was added in commit 8ae743e82f0b ("ALSA: hda - Skip
    ELD notification during system suspend"). It would seem with the deferred
    resume logic in ASoC core, this check is not safe.
    
    Fix the issue by modifying the check to use "dev.power.power_state.event"
    instead of ALSA specific card power state variable.

    kconfig: nconf: stop endless search loops
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c94b430b9f6213dec84e309bb480a71778c4213 ]
    
    If the user selects the very first entry in a page and performs a
    search-up operation, or selects the very last entry in a page and
    performs a search-down operation that will not succeed (e.g., via
    [/]asdfzzz[Up Arrow]), nconf will never terminate searching the page.
    
    The reason is that in this case, the starting point will be set to -1
    or n, which is then translated into (n - 1) (i.e., the last entry of
    the page) or 0 (i.e., the first entry of the page) and finally the
    search begins. This continues to work fine until the index reaches 0 or
    (n - 1), at which point it will be decremented to -1 or incremented to
    n, but not checked against the starting point right away. Instead, it's
    wrapped around to the bottom or top again, after which the starting
    point check occurs... and naturally fails.
    
    My original implementation added another check for -1 before wrapping
    the running index variable around, but Masahiro Yamada pointed out that
    the actual issue is that the comparison point (starting point) exceeds
    bounds (i.e., the [0,n-1] interval) in the first place and that,
    instead, the starting point should be fixed.
    
    This has the welcome side-effect of also fixing the case where the
    starting point was n while searching down, which also lead to an
    infinite loop.
    
    OTOH, this code is now essentially all his work.
    
    Amazingly, nobody seems to have been hit by this for 11 years - or at
    the very least nobody bothered to debug and fix this.

    iommu/amd: Remove performance counter pre-initialization test
    
    [ Upstream commit 994d6608efe4a4c8834bdc5014c86f4bc6aceea6 ]
    
    In early AMD desktop/mobile platforms (during 2013), when the IOMMU
    Performance Counter (PMC) support was first introduced in
    commit 30861ddc9cca ("perf/x86/amd: Add IOMMU Performance Counter
    resource management"), there was a HW bug where the counters could not
    be accessed. The result was reading of the counter always return zero.
    
    At the time, the suggested workaround was to add a test logic prior
    to initializing the PMC feature to check if the counters can be programmed
    and read back the same value. This has been working fine until the more
    recent desktop/mobile platforms start enabling power gating for the PMC,
    which prevents access to the counters. This results in the PMC support
    being disabled unnecesarily.
    
    Unfortunatly, there is no documentation of since which generation
    of hardware the original PMC HW bug was fixed. Although, it was fixed
    soon after the first introduction of the PMC. Base on this, we assume
    that the buggy platforms are less likely to be in used, and it should
    be relatively safe to remove this legacy logic.

    This reverts commit 6778ff5b21bd8e78c8bd547fd66437cf2657fd9b.
    
    The original commit tries to address an issue, where PMC power-gating
    causing the IOMMU PMC pre-init test to fail on certain desktop/mobile
    platforms where the power-gating is normally enabled.
    
    There have been several reports that the workaround still does not
    guarantee to work, and can add up to 100 ms (on the worst case)
    to the boot process on certain platforms such as the MSI B350M MORTAR
    with AMD Ryzen 3 2200G.
    
    Therefore, revert this commit as a prelude to removing the pre-init
    test.

    ASoC: rsnd: call rsnd_ssi_master_clk_start() from rsnd_ssi_init()
    
    [ Upstream commit a122a116fc6d8fcf2f202dcd185173a54268f239 ]
    
    Current rsnd needs to call .prepare (P) for clock settings,
    .trigger for playback start (S) and stop (E).
    It should be called as below from SSI point of view.
    
            P -> S -> E -> P -> S -> E -> ...
    
    But, if you used MIXer, below case might happen
    
                          (2)
            1: P -> S ---> E -> ...
            2:         P ----> S -> ...
                      (1)     (3)
    
    P(1) setups clock, but E(2) resets it. and starts playback (3).
    In such case, it will reports "SSI parent/child should use same rate".
    
    rsnd_ssi_master_clk_start() which is the main function at (P)
    was called from rsnd_ssi_init() (= S) before,
    but was moved by below patch to rsnd_soc_dai_prepare() (= P) to avoid
    using clk_get_rate() which shouldn't be used under atomic context.
    
            commit 4d230d1271064 ("ASoC: rsnd: fixup not to call clk_get/set
                                    under non-atomic")
    
    Because of above patch, rsnd_ssi_master_clk_start() is now called at (P)
    which is for non atomic context. But (P) is assuming that spin lock is
    *not* used.
    One issue now is rsnd_ssi_master_clk_start() is checking ssi->xxx
    which should be protected by spin lock.
    
    After above patch, adg.c had below patch for other reasons.
    
            commit 06e8f5c842f2d ("ASoC: rsnd: don't call clk_get_rate()
                                    under atomic context")
    
    clk_get_rate() is used at probe() timing by this patch.
    In other words, rsnd_ssi_master_clk_start() is no longer using
    clk_get_rate() any more.
    
    This means we can call it from rsnd_ssi_init() (= S) again which is
    protected by spin lock.
    This patch re-move it to under spin lock, and solves
    1. checking ssi->xxx without spin lock issue.
    2. clk setting / device start / device stop race condition.

    call to cond_resched() is issued every HZ jiffies which should prevent
    the soft-lockup from being reported.

    [ Upstream commit d12455fdbfe9430affd88bfbfee51777356667a0 ]
    
    In a few PCIe devices we may have to swap out the configuration
    after we allocate/initialise some parts of the device because
    we only know the correct one after reading some registers. This
    causes some things such as the byte-count table allocations to
    be incorrect, since the configuration is swapped for one with a
    bigger queue size.
    
    Fix this by initialising most of the transport much later, only
    after the configuration has finally been determined.

    iwlwifi: pcie: make cfg vs. trans_cfg more robust
    
    [ Upstream commit 48a5494d6a4cb5812f0640d9515f1876ffc7a013 ]
    
    If we (for example) have a trans_cfg entry in the PCI IDs table,
    but then don't find a full cfg entry for it in the info table,
    we fall through to the code that treats the PCI ID table entry
    as a full cfg entry. This obviously causes crashes later, e.g.
    when trying to build the firmware name string.
    
    Avoid such crashes by using the low bit of the pointer as a tag
    for trans_cfg entries (automatically using a macro that checks
    the type when assigning) and then checking that before trying to
    use the data as a full entry - if it's just a partial entry at
    that point, fail.
    
    Since we're adding some macro magic, also check that the type is
    in fact either struct iwl_cfg_trans_params or struct iwl_cfg,
    failing compilation ("initializer element is not constant") if
    it isn't.

    fuse: invalidate attrs when page writeback completes
    
    [ Upstream commit 3466958beb31a8e9d3a1441a34228ed088b84f3e ]
    
    In fuse when a direct/write-through write happens we invalidate attrs
    because that might have updated mtime/ctime on server and cached
    mtime/ctime will be stale.
    
    What about page writeback path.  Looks like we don't invalidate attrs
    there.  To be consistent, invalidate attrs in writeback path as well.  Only
    exception is when writeback_cache is enabled.  In that case we strust local
    mtime/ctime and there is no need to invalidate attrs.
    
    Recently users started experiencing failure of xfstests generic/080,
    geneirc/215 and generic/614 on virtiofs.  This happened only newer "stat"
    utility and not older one.  This patch fixes the issue.
    
    So what's the root cause of the issue.  Here is detailed explanation.
    
    generic/080 test does mmap write to a file, closes the file and then checks
    if mtime has been updated or not.  When file is closed, it leads to
    flushing of dirty pages (and that should update mtime/ctime on server).
    But we did not explicitly invalidate attrs after writeback finished.  Still
    generic/080 passed so far and reason being that we invalidated atime in
    fuse_readpages_end().  This is called in fuse_readahead() path and always
    seems to trigger before mmaped write.
    
    So after mmaped write when lstat() is called, it sees that atleast one of
    the fields being asked for is invalid (atime) and that results in
    generating GETATTR to server and mtime/ctime also get updated and test
    passes.
    
    But newer /usr/bin/stat seems to have moved to using statx() syscall now
    (instead of using lstat()).  And statx() allows it to query only ctime or
    mtime (and not rest of the basic stat fields).  That means when querying
    for mtime, fuse_update_get_attr() sees that mtime is not invalid (only
    atime is invalid).  So it does not generate a new GETATTR and fill stat
    with cached mtime/ctime.  And that means updated mtime is not seen by
    xfstest and tests start failing.
    
    Invalidating attrs after writeback completion should solve this problem in
    a generic manner.

    When operating two VAP on a MT7610 with encryption (PSK2, SAE, OWE),
    only the first one to be created will transmit properly encrypteded
    frames.
    
    All subsequently created VAPs will sent out frames with the payload left
    unencrypted, breaking multicast traffic (ICMP6 NDP) and potentially
    disclosing information to a third party.
    
    Disable GTK offloading and encrypt these frames in software to

    writel().  On 64-bit ARM using unsigned long for register masks:
    1. makes little sense as immediately after bitwise operation it will be
       cast to 32-bit value when calling writel(),
    2. is actually error-prone because it might promote other operands to
       64-bit.

    [ Upstream commit fba863b816049b03f3fbb07b10ebdcfe5c4141f7 ]
    
    Resume callback of the PHY driver is called after the one for the MAC
    driver. The PHY driver resume callback calls phy_init_hw(), and this is
    potentially problematic if the MAC driver calls phy_start() in its resume
    callback. One issue was reported with the fec driver and a KSZ8081 PHY
    which seems to become unstable if a soft reset is triggered during aneg.
    
    The new flag allows MAC drivers to indicate that they take care of
    suspending/resuming the PHY. Then the MAC PM callbacks can handle
    any dependency between MAC and PHY PM.

    [ Upstream commit 45475bf60cc1d42da229a0aa757180c88bab8d22 ]
    
    If panic_on_warn=1 is added in bootargs and compress offload playback with
    DPCM is started, kernel panic would be occurred because rtd->card->pcm_mutex
    isn't held in soc_compr_open_fe() and soc_compr_free_fe() and it generates
    lockdep warning in the following code.
    
    void snd_soc_runtime_action(struct snd_soc_pcm_runtime *rtd,
                                int stream, int action)

            lockdep_assert_held(&rtd->card->pcm_mutex);
    
    To prevent lockdep warning but minimize side effect by adding mutex,
    pcm_mutex is held just before snd_soc_runtime_activate() and
    snd_soc_runtime_deactivate() and is released right after them.

    mac80211: clear the beacon's CRC after channel switch
    
    [ Upstream commit d6843d1ee283137723b4a8c76244607ce6db1951 ]
    
    After channel switch, we should consider any beacon with a
    CSA IE as a new switch. If the CSA IE is a leftover from
    before the switch that the AP forgot to remove, we'll get
    a CSA-to-Self.
    
    This caused issues in iwlwifi where the firmware saw a beacon
    with a CSA-to-Self with mode = 1 on the new channel after a
    switch. The firmware considered this a new switch and closed
    its queues. Since the beacon didn't change between before and
    after the switch, we wouldn't handle it (the CRC is the same)
    and we wouldn't let the firmware open its queues again or
    disconnect if the CSA IE stays for too long.
    
    Clear the CRC valid state after we switch to make sure that
    we handle the beacon and handle the CSA IE as required.

    mac80211: Set priority and queue mapping for injected frames
    
    [ Upstream commit 96a7109a16665255b65d021e24141c2edae0e202 ]
    
    Some drivers, for example mt76, use the skb priority field, and
    expects that to be consistent with the skb queue mapping. On some
    frame injection code paths that was not true, and it broke frame
    injection. Now the skb queue mapping is set according to the skb
    priority value when the frame is injected. The skb priority value
    is also derived from the frame data for all frame types, as it
    was done prior to commit dbd50a851c50 (only allocate one queue
    when using iTXQs). Fixes frame injection with the mt76 driver on
    MT7610E chipset.

    IB/hfi1: Correct oversized ring allocation
    
    [ Upstream commit b536d4b2a279733f440c911dc831764690b90050 ]
    
    The completion ring for tx is using the wrong size to size the ring,
    oversizing the ring by two orders of magniture.
    
    Correct the allocation size and use kcalloc_node() to allocate the ring.
    Fix mistaken GFP defines in similar allocations.

    coresight: Do not scan for graph if none is present
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b921b671a8d29c2adb255a86409aad1e3267309 ]
    
    If a graph node is not found for a given node, of_get_next_endpoint()
    will emit the following error message :
    
     OF: graph: no port node found in /<node_name>
    
    If the given component doesn't have any explicit connections (e.g,
    ETE) we could simply ignore the graph parsing. As for any legacy
    component where this is mandatory, the device will not be usable
    as before this patch. Updating the DT bindings to Yaml and enabling
    the schema checks can detect such issues with the DT.

    MIPS: Loongson64: Use _CACHE_UNCACHED instead of _CACHE_UNCACHED_ACCELERATED
    
    [ Upstream commit 5e65c52ec716af6e8f51dacdaeb4a4d872249af1 ]
    
    Loongson64 processors have a writecombine issue that maybe failed to
    write back framebuffer used with ATI Radeon or AMD GPU at times, after
    commit 8a08e50cee66 ("drm: Permit video-buffers writecombine mapping
    for MIPS"), there exists some errors such as blurred screen and lockup,
    and so on.
    
    [   60.958721] radeon 0000:03:00.0: ring 0 stalled for more than 10079msec
    [   60.965315] radeon 0000:03:00.0: GPU lockup (current fence id 0x0000000000000112 last fence id 0x000000000000011d on ring 0)

    As discussed earlier [1], it might be better to disable writecombine
    on the CPU detection side because the root cause is unknown now.
    
    Actually, this patch is a temporary solution to just make it work well,
    it is not a proper and final solution, I hope someone will have a better
    solution to fix this issue in the future.

    Bluetooth: Do not set cur_adv_instance in adv param MGMT request
    
    [ Upstream commit b6f1b79deabd32f89adbf24ef7b30f82d029808a ]
    
    We set hdev->cur_adv_instance in the adv param MGMT request to allow the
    callback to the hci param request to set the tx power to the correct
    instance. Now that the callbacks use the advertising handle from the hci
    request (as they should), this workaround is no longer necessary.
    
    Furthermore, this change resolves a race condition that is more
    prevalent when using the extended advertising MGMT calls - if
    hdev->cur_adv_instance is set in the params request, then when the data
    request is called, we believe our new instance is already active. This
    treats it as an update and immediately schedules the instance with the
    controller, which has a potential race with the software rotation adv
    update. By not setting hdev->cur_adv_instance too early, the new
    instance is queued as it should be, to be used when the rotation comes
    around again.
    
    This change is tested on harrison peak to confirm that it resolves the
    race condition on registration, and that there is no regression in
    single- and multi-advertising automated tests.

    selftests: mptcp: launch mptcp_connect with timeout
    
    [ Upstream commit 5888a61cb4e00695075bbacfd86f3fa73af00413 ]
    
    'mptcp_connect' already has a timeout for poll() but in some cases, it
    is not enough.
    
    With "timeout" tool, we will force the command to fail if it doesn't
    finish on time. Thanks to that, the script will continue and display
    details about the current state before marking the test as failed.
    Displaying this state is very important to be able to understand the
    issue. Best to have our CI reporting the issue than just "the test
    hanged".
    
    Note that in mptcp_connect.sh, we were using a long timeout to validate
    the fact we cannot create a socket if a sysctl is set. We don't need
    this timeout.
    
    In diag.sh, we want to send signals to mptcp_connect instances that have
    been started in the netns. But we cannot send this signal to 'timeout'
    otherwise that will stop the timeout and messages telling us SIGUSR1 has
    been received will be printed. Instead of trying to find the right PID
    and storing them in an array, we can simply use the output of
    'ip netns pids' which is all the PIDs we want to send signal to.

    ice: handle increasing Tx or Rx ring sizes
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ec5638559c13b923250eccf495d2a033fccb3e7 ]
    
    There is an issue when the Tx or Rx ring size increases using
    'ethtool -L ...' where the new rings don't get the correct ITR
    values because when we rebuild the VSI we don't know that some
    of the rings may be new.
    
    Fix this by looking at the original number of rings and
    determining if the rings in ice_vsi_rebuild_set_coalesce()
    were not present in the original rings received in
    ice_vsi_rebuild_get_coalesce().
    
    Also change the code to return an error if we can't allocate
    memory for the coalesce data in ice_vsi_rebuild().

    ip6_vti: proper dev_{hold|put} in ndo_[un]init methods
    
    [ Upstream commit 40cb881b5aaa0b69a7d93dec8440d5c62dae299f ]
    
    After adopting CONFIG_PCPU_DEV_REFCNT=n option, syzbot was able to trigger
    a warning [1]
    
    Issue here is that:
    
    - all dev_put() should be paired with a corresponding prior dev_hold().
    
    - A driver doing a dev_put() in its ndo_uninit() MUST also
      do a dev_hold() in its ndo_init(), only when ndo_init()
      is returning 0.
    
    Otherwise, register_netdevice() would call ndo_uninit()
    in its error path and release a refcount too soon.
    
    Therefore, we need to move dev_hold() call from
    vti6_tnl_create2() to vti6_dev_init_gen()

    [ Upstream commit d5d5e0193ee8f88efbbc7f1471087255657bc19a ]
    
    Currently hns3 driver only handle the xmit skb with one level of
    fraglist skb, add handling for multi level by calling hns3_tx_bd_num()
    recursively when calculating bd num and calling hns3_fill_skb_to_desc()
    recursively when filling tx desc.
    
    When the skb has a fraglist level of 24, the skb is simply dropped and
    stats.max_recursion_level is added to record the error. Move the stat
    handling from hns3_nic_net_xmit() to hns3_nic_maybe_stop_tx() in order
    to handle different error stat and add the 'max_recursion_level' and
    'hw_limitation' stat.
    
    Note that the max recursive level as 24 is chose according to below:
    commit 48a1df65334b ("skbuff: return -EMSGSIZE in skb_to_sgvec to
    prevent overflow").
    
    And that we are not able to find a testcase to verify the recursive
    fraglist case, so Fixes tag is not provided.

    net: hns3: remediate a potential overflow risk of bd_num_list
    
    [ Upstream commit a2ee6fd28a190588e142ad8ea9d40069cd3c9f98 ]
    
    The array size of bd_num_list is a fixed value, it may have potential
    overflow risk when array size of hclge_dfx_bd_offset_list is greater
    than that fixed value. So modify bd_num_list as a pointer and allocate
    memory for it according to array size of hclge_dfx_bd_offset_list.

    powerpc/32: Statically initialise first emergency context
    
    [ Upstream commit a4719f5bb6d7dc220bffdc1b9f5ce5eaa5543581 ]
    
    The check of the emergency context initialisation in
    vmap_stack_overflow is buggy for the SMP case, as it
    compares r1 with 0 while in the SMP case r1 is offseted
    by the CPU id.
    
    Instead of fixing it, just perform static initialisation
    of the first emergency context.

    ALSA: hda/hdmi: fix max DP-MST dev_num for Intel TGL+ platforms
    
    [ Upstream commit e839fbed26e8b8713803b8ac73da92fd2b0c7594 ]
    
    Increase the device select range to 4 on platforms supporting
    4 concurrent displays.
    
    This fixes a problem in scenario where total of 4 displays are active,
    and 3 of these are audio capable DP receivers and connected to a DP-MST
    hub. Due to incorrect range for device select, audio could not be played
    to the 3rd monitor in DP-MST hub.

    selftests/powerpc: Fix L1D flushing tests for Power10
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a72c94ebfb1f171eba0715998010678a09ec796 ]
    
    The rfi_flush and entry_flush selftests work by using the PM_LD_MISS_L1
    perf event to count L1D misses.  The value of this event has changed
    over time:
    
    - Power7 uses 0x400f0
    - Power8 and Power9 use both 0x400f0 and 0x3e054
    - Power10 uses only 0x3e054
    
    Rather than relying on raw values, configure perf to count L1D read
    misses in the most explicit way available.
    
    This fixes the selftests to work on systems without 0x400f0 as
    PM_LD_MISS_L1, and should change no behaviour for systems that the tests
    already worked on.
    
    The only potential downside is that referring to a specific perf event
    requires PMU support implemented in the kernel for that platform.

    net: bridge: when suppression is enabled exclude RARP packets
    
    [ Upstream commit 0353b4a96b7a9f60fe20d1b3ebd4931a4085f91c ]
    
    Recently we had an interop issue where RARP packets got suppressed with
    bridge neigh suppression enabled, but the check in the code was meant to
    suppress GARP. Exclude RARP packets from it which would allow some VMWare
    setups to work, to quote the report:
    "Those RARP packets usually get generated by vMware to notify physical
    switches when vMotion occurs. vMware may use random sip/tip or just use
    sip=tip=0. So the RARP packet sometimes get properly flooded by the vtep
    and other times get dropped by the logic"

    net/sched: cls_flower: use ntohs for struct flow_dissector_key_ports

    A make W=1 build complains that:

    net/sched/cls_flower.c:214:20:    got restricted __be16 [usertype] dst
    
    This is because we use htons on struct flow_dissector_key_ports members
    src and dst, which are defined as __be16, so they are already in network
    byte order, not host. The byte swap function for the other direction
    should have been used.
    
    Because htons and ntohs do the same thing (either both swap, or none
    does), this change has no functional effect except to silence the
    warnings.

    Bluetooth: Set CONF_NOT_COMPLETE as l2cap_chan default
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a9d54b1947ecea8eea9a902c0b7eb58a98add8a ]
    
    Currently l2cap_chan_set_defaults() reset chan->conf_state to zero.
    However, there is a flag CONF_NOT_COMPLETE which is set when
    creating the l2cap_chan. It is suggested that the flag should be
    cleared when l2cap_chan is ready, but when l2cap_chan_set_defaults()
    is called, l2cap_chan is not yet ready. Therefore, we must set this
    flag as the default.

    ALSA: hdsp: don't disable if not enabled

    throw a warning. Make sure the device is enabled before calling disable.

    i2c: bail out early when RDWR parameters are wrong
    
    [ Upstream commit 71581562ee36032d2d574a9b23ad4af6d6a64cf7 ]
    
    The buggy parameters currently get caught later, but emit a noisy WARN.
    Userspace should not be able to trigger this, so add similar checks much
    earlier. Also avoids some unneeded code paths, of course. Apply kernel
    coding stlye to a comment while here.

    ASoC: rsnd: core: Check convert rate in rsnd_hw_params
    
    [ Upstream commit 19c6a63ced5e07e40f3a5255cb1f0fe0d3be7b14 ]
    
    snd_pcm_hw_params_set_rate_near can return incorrect sample rate in
    some cases, e.g. when the backend output rate is set to some value higher
    than 48000 Hz and the input rate is 8000 Hz. So passing the value returned
    by snd_pcm_hw_params_set_rate_near to snd_pcm_hw_params will result in
    "FSO/FSI ratio error" and playing no audio at all while the userland
    is not properly notified about the issue.
    
    If SRC is unable to convert the requested sample rate to the sample rate
    the backend is using, then the requested sample rate should be adjusted in
    rsnd_hw_params. The userland will be notified about that change in the
    returned hw_params structure.

    net: stmmac: Set FIFO sizes for ipq806x
    
    [ Upstream commit e127906b68b49ddb3ecba39ffa36a329c48197d3 ]
    
    Commit eaf4fac47807 ("net: stmmac: Do not accept invalid MTU values")
    started using the TX FIFO size to verify what counts as a valid MTU
    request for the stmmac driver.  This is unset for the ipq806x variant.
    Looking at older patches for this it seems the RX + TXs buffers can be
    up to 8k, so set appropriately.
    
    (I sent this as an RFC patch in June last year, but received no replies.
    I've been running with this on my hardware (a MikroTik RB3011) since
    then with larger MTUs to support both the internal qca8k switch and
    VLANs with no problems. Without the patch it's impossible to set the
    larger MTU required to support this.)

    net/mlx5e: Use net_prefetchw instead of prefetchw in MPWQE TX datapath
    
    [ Upstream commit 991b2654605b455a94dac73e14b23480e7e20991 ]
    
    Commit e20f0dbf204f ("net/mlx5e: RX, Add a prefetch command for small
    L1_CACHE_BYTES") switched to using net_prefetchw at all places in mlx5e.
    In the same time frame, commit 5af75c747e2a ("net/mlx5e: Enhanced TX
    MPWQE for SKBs") added one more usage of prefetchw. When these two
    changes were merged, this new occurrence of prefetchw wasn't replaced
    with net_prefetchw.
    
    This commit fixes this last occurrence of prefetchw in
    mlx5e_tx_mpwqe_session_start, making the same change that was done in
    mlx5e_xdp_mpwqe_session_start.

    fs: dlm: add shutdown hook
    
    [ Upstream commit 9d232469bcd772dbedb9e75a165c681b920524ee ]
    
    This patch fixes issues which occurs when dlm lowcomms synchronize their
    workqueues but dlm application layer already released the lockspace. In
    such cases messages like:
    
    dlm: gfs2: release_lockspace final free
    dlm: invalid lockspace 3841231384 from 1 cmd 1 type 11
    
    are printed on the kernel log. This patch is solving this issue by
    introducing a new "shutdown" hook before calling "stop" hook when the
    lockspace is going to be released finally. This should pretend any
    dlm messages sitting in the workqueues during or after lockspace
    removal.
    
    It's necessary to call dlm_scand_stop() as I instrumented
    dlm_lowcomms_get_buffer() code to report a warning after it's called after
    dlm_midcomms_shutdown() functionality, see below:

    [ Upstream commit eec054b5a7cfe6d1f1598a323b05771ee99857b5 ]
    
    This patch fixes the flushing of send work before shutdown. The function
    cancel_work_sync() is not the right workqueue functionality to use here
    as it would cancel the work if the work queues itself. In cases of
    EAGAIN in send() for dlm message we need to be sure that everything is
    send out before. The function flush_work() will ensure that every send
    work is be done inclusive in EAGAIN cases.

    This patch fixes an deadlock issue when dlm_lowcomms_close() is called.
    When dlm_lowcomms_close() is called the clusters_root.subsys.su_mutex is
    held to remove configfs items. At this time we flushing (e.g.
    cancel_work_sync()) the workers of send and recv workqueue. Due the fact
    that we accessing configfs items (mark values), these workers will lock
    clusters_root.subsys.su_mutex as well which are already hold by
    dlm_lowcomms_close() and ends in a deadlock situation.

    kvm: Cap halt polling at kvm->max_halt_poll_ns
    
    commit 258785ef08b323bddd844b4926a32c2b2045a1b0 upstream.
    
    When growing halt-polling, there is no check that the poll time exceeds
    the per-VM limit. It's possible for vcpu->halt_poll_ns to grow past
    kvm->max_halt_poll_ns and stay there until a halt which takes longer
    than kvm->halt_poll_ns.

    cpufreq: intel_pstate: Use HWP if enabled by platform firmware
    
    commit e5af36b2adb858e982d78d41d7363d05d951a19a upstream.
    
    It turns out that there are systems where HWP is enabled during
    initialization by the platform firmware (BIOS), but HWP EPP support
    is not advertised.
    
    After commit 7aa1031223bc ("cpufreq: intel_pstate: Avoid enabling HWP
    if EPP is not supported") intel_pstate refuses to use HWP on those
    systems, but the fallback PERF_CTL interface does not work on them
    either because of enabled HWP, and once enabled, HWP cannot be
    disabled.  Consequently, the users of those systems cannot control
    CPU performance scaling.
    
    Address this issue by making intel_pstate use HWP unconditionally if
    it is enabled already when the driver starts.

    PM: runtime: Fix unpaired parent child_count for force_resume
    
    commit c745253e2a691a40c66790defe85c104a887e14a upstream.
    
    As pm_runtime_need_not_resume() relies also on usage_count, it can return
    a different value in pm_runtime_force_suspend() compared to when called in
    pm_runtime_force_resume(). Different return values can happen if anything
    calls PM runtime functions in between, and causes the parent child_count
    to increase on every resume.
    
    So far I've seen the issue only for omapdrm that does complicated things
    with PM runtime calls during system suspend for legacy reasons:
    
    omap_atomic_commit_tail() for omapdrm.0
     dispc_runtime_get()
      wakes up 58000000.dss as it's the dispc parent
       dispc_runtime_resume()
        rpm_resume() increases parent child_count
     dispc_runtime_put() won't idle, PM runtime suspend blocked
    pm_runtime_force_suspend() for 58000000.dss, !pm_runtime_need_not_resume()
     __update_runtime_status()
    system suspended
    pm_runtime_force_resume() for 58000000.dss, pm_runtime_need_not_resume()
     pm_runtime_enable() only called because of pm_runtime_need_not_resume()
    omap_atomic_commit_tail() for omapdrm.0
     dispc_runtime_get()
      wakes up 58000000.dss as it's the dispc parent
       dispc_runtime_resume()
        rpm_resume() increases parent child_count
     dispc_runtime_put() won't idle, PM runtime suspend blocked
    ...
    rpm_suspend for 58000000.dss but parent child_count is now unbalanced
    
    Let's fix the issue by adding a flag for needs_force_resume and use it in
    pm_runtime_force_resume() instead of pm_runtime_need_not_resume().
    
    Additionally omapdrm system suspend could be simplified later on to avoid
    lots of unnecessary PM runtime calls and the complexity it adds. The
    driver can just use internal functions that are shared between the PM
    runtime and system suspend related functions.

    KVM/VMX: Invoke NMI non-IST entry instead of IST entry
    
    commit a217a6593cec8b315d4c2f344bae33660b39b703 upstream.
    
    In VMX, the host NMI handler needs to be invoked after NMI VM-Exit.
    Before commit 1a5488ef0dcf6 ("KVM: VMX: Invoke NMI handler via indirect
    call instead of INTn"), this was done by INTn ("int $2"). But INTn
    microcode is relatively expensive, so the commit reworked NMI VM-Exit
    handling to invoke the kernel handler by function call.
    
    But this missed a detail. The NMI entry point for direct invocation is
    fetched from the IDT table and called on the kernel stack.  But on 64-bit
    the NMI entry installed in the IDT expects to be invoked on the IST stack.
    It relies on the "NMI executing" variable on the IST stack to work
    correctly, which is at a fixed position in the IST stack.  When the entry
    point is unexpectedly called on the kernel stack, the RSP-addressed "NMI
    executing" variable is obviously also on the kernel stack and is
    "uninitialized" and can cause the NMI entry code to run in the wrong way.
    
    Provide a non-ist entry point for VMX which shares the C-function with
    the regular NMI entry and invoke the new asm entry point instead.
    
    On 32-bit this just maps to the regular NMI entry point as 32-bit has no
    ISTs and is not affected.

    KVM: SVM: Make sure GHCB is mapped before updating
    
    commit a3ba26ecfb569f4aa3f867e80c02aa65f20aadad upstream.
    
    Access to the GHCB is mainly in the VMGEXIT path and it is known that the
    GHCB will be mapped. But there are two paths where it is possible the GHCB
    might not be mapped.
    
    The sev_vcpu_deliver_sipi_vector() routine will update the GHCB to inform
    the caller of the AP Reset Hold NAE event that a SIPI has been delivered.
    However, if a SIPI is performed without a corresponding AP Reset Hold,
    then the GHCB might not be mapped (depending on the previous VMEXIT),
    which will result in a NULL pointer dereference.
    
    The svm_complete_emulated_msr() routine will update the GHCB to inform
    the caller of a RDMSR/WRMSR operation about any errors. While it is likely
    that the GHCB will be mapped in this situation, add a safe guard
    in this path to be certain a NULL pointer dereference is not encountered.

    btrfs: fix unmountable seed device after fstrim
    
    commit 5e753a817b2d5991dfe8a801b7b1e8e79a1c5a20 upstream.
    
    The following test case reproduces an issue of wrongly freeing in-use
    blocks on the readonly seed device when fstrim is called on the rw sprout
    device. As shown below.
    
    Create a seed device and add a sprout device to it:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -fq -dsingle -msingle /dev/loop0
      $ btrfstune -S 1 /dev/loop0
      $ mount /dev/loop0 /btrfs
      $ btrfs dev add -f /dev/loop1 /btrfs
      BTRFS info (device loop0): relocating block group 290455552 flags system
      BTRFS info (device loop0): relocating block group 1048576 flags system
      BTRFS info (device loop0): disk added /dev/loop1
      $ umount /btrfs
    
    Mount the sprout device and run fstrim:
    
      $ mount /dev/loop1 /btrfs
      $ fstrim /btrfs
      $ umount /btrfs
    
    Now try to mount the seed device, and it fails:
    
      $ mount /dev/loop0 /btrfs
      mount: /btrfs: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop0, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.
    
    Block 5292032 is missing on the readonly seed device:
    
     $ dmesg -kt | tail
     <snip>
     BTRFS error (device loop0): bad tree block start, want 5292032 have 0
     BTRFS warning (device loop0): couldn't read-tree root
     BTRFS error (device loop0): open_ctree failed
    
    From the dump-tree of the seed device (taken before the fstrim). Block
    5292032 belonged to the block group starting at 5242880:
    
      $ btrfs inspect dump-tree -e /dev/loop0 | grep -A1 BLOCK_GROUP
      <snip>
      item 3 key (5242880 BLOCK_GROUP_ITEM 8388608) itemoff 16169 itemsize 24
            block group used 114688 chunk_objectid 256 flags METADATA
      <snip>
    
    From the dump-tree of the sprout device (taken before the fstrim).
    fstrim used block-group 5242880 to find the related free space to free:
    
      $ btrfs inspect dump-tree -e /dev/loop1 | grep -A1 BLOCK_GROUP
      <snip>
      item 1 key (5242880 BLOCK_GROUP_ITEM 8388608) itemoff 16226 itemsize 24
            block group used 32768 chunk_objectid 256 flags METADATA
      <snip>
    
    BPF kernel tracing the fstrim command finds the missing block 5292032
    within the range of the discarded blocks as below:
    
      kprobe:btrfs_discard_extent {
            printf("freeing start %llu end %llu num_bytes %llu:\n",
                    arg1, arg1+arg2, arg2);
      }
    
      freeing start 5259264 end 5406720 num_bytes 147456
      <snip>
    
    Fix this by avoiding the discard command to the readonly seed device.
