    SCSI: sg: Fix user memory corruption when SG_IO is interrupted by a signal
    
    commit 35dc248383bbab0a7203fca4d722875bc81ef091 upstream.
    
    There is a nasty bug in the SCSI SG_IO ioctl that in some circumstances
    leads to one process writing data into the address space of some other
    random unrelated process if the ioctl is interrupted by a signal.
    What happens is the following:
    
     - A process issues an SG_IO ioctl with direction DXFER_FROM_DEV (ie the
       underlying SCSI command will transfer data from the SCSI device to
       the buffer provided in the ioctl)
    
     - Before the command finishes, a signal is sent to the process waiting
       in the ioctl.  This will end up waking up the sg_ioctl() code:
    
                    result = wait_event_interruptible(sfp->read_wait,
                            (srp_done(sfp, srp) || sdp->detached));
    
       but neither srp_done() nor sdp->detached is true, so we end up just
       setting srp->orphan and returning to userspace:
    
                    srp->orphan = 1;
                    write_unlock_irq(&sfp->rq_list_lock);
                    return result;  /* -ERESTARTSYS because signal hit process */
    
       At this point the original process is done with the ioctl and
       blithely goes ahead handling the signal, reissuing the ioctl, etc.
    
     - Eventually, the SCSI command issued by the first ioctl finishes and
       ends up in sg_rq_end_io().  At the end of that function, we run through:
    
            write_lock_irqsave(&sfp->rq_list_lock, iflags);
            if (unlikely(srp->orphan)) {
                    if (sfp->keep_orphan)
                            srp->sg_io_owned = 0;
                    else
                            done = 0;
            }
            srp->done = done;
            write_unlock_irqrestore(&sfp->rq_list_lock, iflags);
    
            if (likely(done)) {
                    /* Now wake up any sg_read() that is waiting for this
                     * packet.
                     */
                    wake_up_interruptible(&sfp->read_wait);
                    kill_fasync(&sfp->async_qp, SIGPOLL, POLL_IN);
                    kref_put(&sfp->f_ref, sg_remove_sfp);
            } else {
                    INIT_WORK(&srp->ew.work, sg_rq_end_io_usercontext);
                    schedule_work(&srp->ew.work);
            }
    
       Since srp->orphan *is* set, we set done to 0 (assuming the
       userspace app has not set keep_orphan via an SG_SET_KEEP_ORPHAN
       ioctl), and therefore we end up scheduling sg_rq_end_io_usercontext()
       to run in a workqueue.
    
     - In workqueue context we go through sg_rq_end_io_usercontext() ->
       sg_finish_rem_req() -> blk_rq_unmap_user() -> ... ->
       bio_uncopy_user() -> __bio_copy_iov() -> copy_to_user().
    
       The key point here is that we are doing copy_to_user() on a
       workqueue -- that is, we're on a kernel thread with current->mm
       equal to whatever random previous user process was scheduled before
       this kernel thread.  So we end up copying whatever data the SCSI
       command returned to the virtual address of the buffer passed into
       the original ioctl, but it's quite likely we do this copying into a
       different address space!
    
    As suggested by James Bottomley <James.Bottomley@hansenpartnership.com>,
    add a check for current->mm (which is NULL if we're on a kernel thread
    without a real userspace address space) in bio_uncopy_user(), and skip
    the copy if we're on a kernel thread.
    
    There's no reason that I can think of for any caller of bio_uncopy_user()
    to want to do copying on a kernel thread with a random active userspace
    address space.

    original pointer to this bug in the sg code.

    target: Fix trailing ASCII space usage in INQUIRY vendor+model
    
    commit ee60bddba5a5f23e39598195d944aa0eb2d455e5 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes spc_emulate_inquiry_std() to add trailing ASCII
    spaces for INQUIRY vendor + model fields following SPC-4 text:
    
      "ASCII data fields described as being left-aligned shall have any
       unused bytes at the end of the field (i.e., highest offset) and
       the unused bytes shall be filled with ASCII space characters (20h)."
    
    This addresses a problem with Falconstor NSS multipathing.

    ACPI / EC: Add ASUSTEK L4R to quirk list in order to validate ECDT
    
    commit 524f42fab787a9510be826ce3d736b56d454ac6d upstream.
    
    The ECDT of ASUSTEK L4R doesn't provide correct command and data
    I/O ports.  The DSDT provides the correct information instead.
    
    For this reason, add this machine to quirk list for ECDT validation
    and use the EC information from the DSDT.

    ath9k_htc: Restore skb headroom when returning skb to mac80211
    
    commit d2e9fc141e2aa21f4b35ee27072d84e9aa6e2ba0 upstream.
    
    ath9k_htc adds padding between the 802.11 header and the payload during
    TX by moving the header. When handing the frame back to mac80211 for TX
    status handling the header is not moved back into its original position.
    This can result in a too small skb headroom when entering ath9k_htc
    again (due to a soft retransmission for example) causing an
    skb_under_panic oops.
    
    Fix this by moving the 802.11 header back into its original position
    before returning the frame to mac80211 as other drivers like rt2x00
    or ath5k do.

    SUNRPC: Fix memory corruption issue on 32-bit highmem systems
    
    commit 347e2233b7667e336d9f671f1a52dfa3f0416e2c upstream.
    
    Some architectures, such as ARM-32 do not return the same base address
    when you call kmap_atomic() twice on the same page.
    This causes problems for the memmove() call in the XDR helper routine
    "_shift_data_right_pages()", since it defeats the detection of
    overlapping memory ranges, and has been seen to corrupt memory.
    
    The fix is to distinguish between the case where we're doing an
    inter-page copy or not. In the former case of we know that the memory
    ranges cannot possibly overlap, so we can additionally micro-optimise
    by replacing memmove() with memcpy().

    drivers/base/memory.c: fix show_mem_removable() to handle missing sections
    
    commit 21ea9f5ace3a7317cc3ba1fbc749758021a83136 upstream.
    
    "cat /sys/devices/system/memory/memory*/removable" crashed the system.
    
    The problem is that show_mem_removable() is passing a
    bad pfn to is_mem_section_removable(), which causes
    
        if (!node_online(page_to_nid(page)))
    
    to blow up.  Why is it passing in a bad pfn?
    
    The reason is that show_mem_removable() will loop sections_per_block
    times.  sections_per_block is 16, but mem->section_count is 8,
    indicating holes in this memory block.  Checking that the memory section
    is present before checking to see if the memory section is removable
    fixes the problem.

    regmap: silence GCC warning
    
    commit a8f28cfad8cd44d7c34b166d0e5ace1125dbee1f upstream.
    
    Building regmap.o triggers this GCC warning:
        drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c: In function ‘regmap_raw_read’:
        drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c:1172:6: warning: ‘ret’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
    
    Long story short: Jakub Jelinek pointed out that there is a type
    mismatch between 'num' in regmap_volatile_range() and 'val_count' in
    regmap_raw_read(). And indeed, converting 'num' to the type of
    'val_count' (ie, size_t) makes this warning go away.

    powerpc/hvsi: Increase handshake timeout from 200ms to 400ms.
    
    commit d220980b701d838560a70de691b53be007e99e78 upstream.
    
    This solves a problem observed in kexec'ed kernel where 200ms timeout is
    too short and bootconsole fails to initialize. Console did eventually
    become workable but much later into the boot process.
    
    Observed timeout was around 260ms, but I decided to make it a little bigger
    for more reliability.
    
    This has been tested on Power7 machine with Petitboot as a primary
    bootloader and PowerNV firmware.

    powerpc: Work around gcc miscompilation of __pa() on 64-bit
    
    commit bdbc29c19b2633b1d9c52638fb732bcde7a2031a upstream.
    
    On 64-bit, __pa(&static_var) gets miscompiled by recent versions of
    gcc as something like:
    
            addis 3,2,.LANCHOR1+4611686018427387904@toc@ha
            addi 3,3,.LANCHOR1+4611686018427387904@toc@l
    
    This ends up effectively ignoring the offset, since its bottom 32 bits
    are zero, and means that the result of __pa() still has 0xC in the top
    nibble.  This happens with gcc 4.8.1, at least.
    
    To work around this, for 64-bit we make __pa() use an AND operator,
    and for symmetry, we make __va() use an OR operator.  Using an AND
    operator rather than a subtraction ends up with slightly shorter code
    since it can be done with a single clrldi instruction, whereas it
    takes three instructions to form the constant (-PAGE_OFFSET) and add
    it on.  (Note that MEMORY_START is always 0 on 64-bit.)

    ALSA: opti9xx: Fix conflicting driver object name
    
    commit fb615499f0ad28ed74201c1cdfddf9e64e205424 upstream.
    
    The recent commit to delay the release of kobject triggered NULL
    dereferences of opti9xx drivers.  The cause is that all
    snd-opti92x-ad1848, snd-opti92x-cs4231 and snd-opti93x drivers
    register the PnP card driver with the very same name, and also
    snd-opti92x-ad1848 and -cs4231 drivers register the ISA driver with
    the same name, too.  When these drivers are built in, quick
    "register-release-and-re-register" actions occur, and this results in
    Oops because of the same name is assigned to the kobject.
    
    The fix is simply to assign individual names.  As a bonus, by using
    KBUILD_MODNAME, the patch reduces more lines than it adds.
    
    The fix is based on the suggestion by Russell King.

    jfs: fix readdir cookie incompatibility with NFSv4
    
    commit 44512449c0ab368889dd13ae0031fba74ee7e1d2 upstream.
    
    NFSv4 reserves readdir cookie values 0-2 for special entries (. and ..),
    but jfs allows a value of 2 for a non-special entry. This incompatibility
    can result in the nfs client reporting a readdir loop.
    
    This patch doesn't change the value stored internally, but adds one to
    the value exposed to the iterate method.
