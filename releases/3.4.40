    rt2x00: rt2x00pci_regbusy_read() - only print register access failure once
    
    commit 83589b30f1e1dc9898986293c9336b8ce1705dec upstream.
    
    BugLink: http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1128840
    
    It appears that when this register read fails it never recovers, so
    I think there is no need to repeat the same error message ad infinitum.

    mm: prevent mmap_cache race in find_vma()
    
    commit b6a9b7f6b1f21735a7456d534dc0e68e61359d2c upstream.
    
    find_vma() can be called by multiple threads with read lock
    held on mm->mmap_sem and any of them can update mm->mmap_cache.
    Prevent compiler from re-fetching mm->mmap_cache, because other
    readers could update it in the meantime:
    
                   thread 1                             thread 2
                                            |
      find_vma()                            |  find_vma()
        struct vm_area_struct *vma = NULL;  |
        vma = mm->mmap_cache;               |
        if (!(vma && vma->vm_end > addr     |
            && vma->vm_start <= addr)) {    |
                                            |    mm->mmap_cache = vma;
        return vma;                         |
         ^^ compiler may optimize this      |
            local variable out and re-read  |
            mm->mmap_cache                  |
    
    This issue can be reproduced with gcc-4.8.0-1 on s390x by running
    mallocstress testcase from LTP, which triggers:

    panic: fix a possible deadlock in panic()
    
    commit 190320c3b6640d4104650f55ff69611e050ea06b upstream.
    
    panic_lock is meant to ensure that panic processing takes place only on
    one cpu; if any of the other cpus encounter a panic, they will spin
    waiting to be shut down.
    
    However, this causes a regression in this scenario:
    
    1. Cpu 0 encounters a panic and acquires the panic_lock
       and proceeds with the panic processing.
    2. There is an interrupt on cpu 0 that also encounters
       an error condition and invokes panic.
    3. This second invocation fails to acquire the panic_lock
       and enters the infinite while loop in panic_smp_self_stop.
    
    Thus all panic processing is stopped, and the cpu is stuck for eternity
    in the while(1) inside panic_smp_self_stop.
    
    To address this, disable local interrupts with local_irq_disable before
    acquiring the panic_lock.  This will prevent interrupt handlers from
    executing during the panic processing, thus avoiding this particular
    problem.

    thermal: return an error on failure to register thermal class
    
    commit da28d966f6aa942ae836d09729f76a1647932309 upstream.
    
    The return code from the registration of the thermal class is used to
    unallocate resources, but this failure isn't passed back to the caller of
    thermal_init.  Return this failure back to the caller.
    
    This bug was introduced in changeset 4cb18728 which overwrote the return code
    when the variable was re-used to catch the return code of the registration of
    the genetlink thermal socket family.

    x86: Fix rebuild with EFI_STUB enabled
    
    commit 918708245e92941df16a634dc201b407d12bcd91 upstream.
    
    eboot.o and efi_stub_$(BITS).o didn't get added to "targets", and hence
    their .cmd files don't get included by the build machinery, leading to
    the files always getting rebuilt.
    
    Rather than adding the two files individually, take the opportunity and
    add $(VMLINUX_OBJS) to "targets" instead, thus allowing the assignment
    at the top of the file to be shrunk quite a bit.
    
    At the same time, remove a pointless flags override line - the variable
    assigned to was misspelled anyway, and the options added are
    meaningless for assembly sources.
    
    [ hpa: the patch is not minimal, but I am taking it for -urgent anyway
      since the excess impact of the patch seems to be small enough. ]

    spinlocks and preemption points need to be at least compiler barriers
    
    commit 386afc91144b36b42117b0092893f15bc8798a80 upstream.
    
    In UP and non-preempt respectively, the spinlocks and preemption
    disable/enable points are stubbed out entirely, because there is no
    regular code that can ever hit the kind of concurrency they are meant to
    protect against.
    
    However, while there is no regular code that can cause scheduling, we
    _do_ end up having some exceptional (literally!) code that can do so,
    and that we need to make sure does not ever get moved into the critical
    region by the compiler.
    
    In particular, get_user() and put_user() is generally implemented as
    inline asm statements (even if the inline asm may then make a call
    instruction to call out-of-line), and can obviously cause a page fault
    and IO as a result.  If that inline asm has been scheduled into the
    middle of a preemption-safe (or spinlock-protected) code region, we
    obviously lose.
    
    Now, admittedly this is *very* unlikely to actually ever happen, and
    we've not seen examples of actual bugs related to this.  But partly
    exactly because it's so hard to trigger and the resulting bug is so
    subtle, we should be extra careful to get this right.
    
    So make sure that even when preemption is disabled, and we don't have to
    generate any actual *code* to explicitly tell the system that we are in
    a preemption-disabled region, we need to at least tell the compiler not
    to move things around the critical region.
    
    This patch grew out of the same discussion that caused commits
    79e5f05edcbf ("ARC: Add implicit compiler barrier to raw_local_irq*
    functions") and 3e2e0d2c222b ("tile: comment assumption about
    __insn_mtspr for <asm/irqflags.h>") to come about.
    
    Note for stable: use discretion when/if applying this.  As mentioned,
    this bug may never have actually bitten anybody, and gcc may never have
    done the required code motion for it to possibly ever trigger in
    practice.

    x86: remove the x32 syscall bitmask from syscall_get_nr()
    
    commit 8b4b9f27e57584f3d90e0bb84cf800ad81cfe3a1 upstream.
    
    Commit fca460f95e928bae373daa8295877b6905bc62b8 simplified the x32
    implementation by creating a syscall bitmask, equal to 0x40000000, that
    could be applied to x32 syscalls such that the masked syscall number
    would be the same as a x86_64 syscall.  While that patch was a nice
    way to simplify the code, it went a bit too far by adding the mask to
    syscall_get_nr(); returning the masked syscall numbers can cause
    confusion with callers that expect syscall numbers matching the x32
    ABI, e.g. unmasked syscall numbers.
    
    This patch fixes this by simply removing the mask from syscall_get_nr()
    while preserving the other changes from the original commit.  While
    there are several syscall_get_nr() callers in the kernel, most simply
    check that the syscall number is greater than zero, in this case this
    patch will have no effect.  Of those remaining callers, they appear
    to be few, seccomp and ftrace, and from my testing of seccomp without
    this patch the original commit definitely breaks things; the seccomp
    filter does not correctly filter the syscalls due to the difference in
    syscall numbers in the BPF filter and the value from syscall_get_nr().
    Applying this patch restores the seccomp BPF filter functionality on
    x32.
    
    I've tested this patch with the seccomp BPF filters as well as ftrace
    and everything looks reasonable to me; needless to say general usage
    seemed fine as well.

    powerpc: pSeries_lpar_hpte_remove fails from Adjunct partition being performed before the ANDCOND test
    
    commit 9fb2640159f9d4f5a2a9d60e490482d4cbecafdb upstream.
    
    Some versions of pHyp will perform the adjunct partition test before the
    ANDCOND test.  The result of this is that H_RESOURCE can be returned and
    cause the BUG_ON condition to occur. The HPTE is not removed.  So add a
    check for H_RESOURCE, it is ok if this HPTE is not removed as
    pSeries_lpar_hpte_remove is looking for an HPTE to remove and not a
    specific HPTE to remove.  So it is ok to just move on to the next slot
    and try again.

    libata: Use integer return value for atapi_command_packet_set
    
    commit d8668fcb0b257d9fdcfbe5c172a99b8d85e1cd82 upstream.
    
    The function returns type of ATAPI drives so it should return integer value.
    The commit 4dce8ba94c7 (libata: Use 'bool' return value for ata_id_XXX) since
    v2.6.39 changed the type of return value from int to bool, the change would
    cause all of the ATAPI class drives to be treated as TYPE_TAPE and the
    max_sectors of the drives to be set to 65535 because of the commit
    f8d8e5799b7(libata: increase 128 KB / cmd limit for ATAPI tape drives), for the
    function would return true for all ATAPI class drives and the TYPE_TAPE is
    defined as 0x01.

    EISA/PCI: Fix bus res reference
    
    commit 2cfda637e29ce9e3df31b59f64516b2e571cc985 upstream.
    
    Matthew found that 3.8.3 is having problems with an old (ancient)
    PCI-to-EISA bridge, the Intel 82375. It worked with the 3.2 kernel.
    He identified the 82375, but doesn't assign the struct resource *res
    pointer inside the struct eisa_root_device, and panics.
    
    pci_eisa_init() was using bus->resource[] directly instead of
    pci_bus_resource_n().  The bus->resource[] array is a PCI-internal
    implementation detail, and after commit 45ca9e97 (PCI: add helpers for
    building PCI bus resource lists) and commit 0efd5aab (PCI: add struct
    pci_host_bridge_window with CPU/bus address offset), bus->resource[] is not
    used for PCI root buses any more.
    
    The 82375 is a subtractive-decode PCI device, so handle it the same
    way we handle PCI-PCI bridges in subtractive-decode mode in
    pci_read_bridge_bases().

    EISA/PCI: Init EISA early, before PNP
    
    commit c5fb301ae83bec6892e54984e6ec765c47df8e10 upstream.
    
    Matthew reported kernels fail the pci_eisa probe and are later successful
    with the virtual_eisa_root_init force probe without slot0.
    
    The reason for that is: PNP probing is before pci_eisa_init gets called
    as pci_eisa_init is called via pci_driver.
    
    pnp 00:0f has 0xc80 - 0xc84 reserved.
    [    9.700409] pnp 00:0f: [io  0x0c80-0x0c84]
    
    so eisa_probe will fail from pci_eisa_init
                                    ==>eisa_root_register
                                            ==>eisa_probe path.
    as force_probe is not set in pci_eisa_root, it will bail early when
    slot0 is not probed and initialized.
    
    Try to use subsys_initcall_sync instead, and will keep following sequence:
            pci_subsys_init
            pci_eisa_init_early
            pnpacpi_init/isapnp_init
    
    After this patch EISA can be initialized properly, and PNP overlapping
    resource will not be reserved.
    [   10.104434] system 00:0f: [io  0x0c80-0x0c84] could not be reserved

    reiserfs: Fix warning and inode leak when deleting inode with xattrs
    
    commit 35e5cbc0af240778e61113286c019837e06aeec6 upstream.
    
    After commit 21d8a15a (lookup_one_len: don't accept . and ..) reiserfs
    started failing to delete xattrs from inode. This was due to a buggy
    test for '.' and '..' in fill_with_dentries() which resulted in passing
    '.' and '..' entries to lookup_one_len() in some cases. That returned
    error and so we failed to iterate over all xattrs of and inode.
    
    Fix the test in fill_with_dentries() along the lines of the one in
    lookup_one_len().

    UBIFS: make space fixup work in the remount case
    
    commit 67e753ca41782913d805ff4a8a2b0f60b26b7915 upstream.
    
    The UBIFS space fixup is a useful feature which allows to fixup the "broken"
    flash space at the time of the first mount. The "broken" space is usually the
    result of using a "dumb" industrial flasher which is not able to skip empty
    NAND pages and just writes all 0xFFs to the empty space, which has grave
    side-effects for UBIFS when UBIFS trise to write useful data to those empty
    pages.
    
    The fix-up feature works roughly like this:
    1. mkfs.ubifs sets the fixup flag in UBIFS superblock when creating the image
       (see -F option)
    2. when the file-system is mounted for the first time, UBIFS notices the fixup
       flag and re-writes the entire media atomically, which may take really a lot
       of time.
    3. UBIFS clears the fixup flag in the superblock.
    
    This works fine when the file system is mounted R/W for the very first time.
    But it did not really work in the case when we first mount the file-system R/O,
    and then re-mount R/W. The reason was that we started the fixup procedure too
    late, which we cannot really do because we have to fixup the space before it
    starts being used.

    spi/mpc512x-psc: optionally keep PSC SS asserted across xfer segmensts
    
    commit 1ad849aee5f53353ed88d9cd3d68a51b03a7d44f upstream.
    
    Some SPI slave devices require asserted chip select signal across
    multiple transfer segments of an SPI message. Currently the driver
    always de-asserts the internal SS signal for every single transfer
    segment of the message and ignores the 'cs_change' flag of the
    transfer description. Disable the internal chip select (SS) only
    if this is needed and indicated by the 'cs_change' flag.
    
    Without this change, each partial transfer of a surrounding
    multi-part SPI transaction might erroneously change the SS
    signal, which might prevent slaves from answering the request
    that was sent in a previous transfer segment because the
    transaction could be considered aborted (SS was de-asserted
    before reading the response).

    commit 375981f2e14868be16cafbffd34a4f16a6ee01c6 upstream.
    
    The status of the interrupt is available in the status register,
    so reading the clear pending register and writing back the same
    value will not actually clear the pending interrupts. This patch
    modifies the interrupt handler to read the status register and
    clear the corresponding pending bit in the clear pending register.
    
    Modified the hwInit function to clear all the pending interrupts.

    regmap: cache Fix regcache-rbtree sync
    
    commit 8abac3ba51b5525354e9b2ec0eed1c9e95c905d9 upstream.
    
    The last register block, which falls into the specified range, is not handled
    correctly. The formula which calculates the number of register which should be
    synced is inverse (and off by one). E.g. if all registers in that block should
    be synced only one is synced, and if only one should be synced all (but one) are
    synced. To calculate the number of registers that need to be synced we need to
    subtract the number of the first register in the block from the max register
    number and add one. This patch updates the code accordingly.
    
    The issue was introduced in commit ac8d91c ("regmap: Supply ranges to the sync
