    usb: dwc3: core: fix kernel panic when do reboot
    
    commit 4bf584a03eec674975ee9fe36c8583d9d470dab1 upstream.
    
    When do system reboot, it calls dwc3_shutdown and the whole debugfs
    for dwc3 has removed first, when the gadget tries to do deinit, and
    remove debugfs for its endpoints, it meets NULL pointer dereference
    issue when call debugfs_lookup. Fix it by removing the whole dwc3
    debugfs later than dwc3_drd_exit.

    usb: dwc3: debugfs: Add and remove endpoint dirs dynamically
    
    commit 8d396bb0a5b62b326f6be7594d8bd46b088296bd upstream.
    
    The DWC3 DebugFS directory and files are currently created once
    during probe.  This includes creation of subdirectories for each
    of the gadget's endpoints.  This works fine for peripheral-only
    controllers, as dwc3_core_init_mode() calls dwc3_gadget_init()
    just prior to calling dwc3_debugfs_init().
    
    However, for dual-role controllers, dwc3_core_init_mode() will
    instead call dwc3_drd_init() which is problematic in a few ways.
    First, the initial state must be determined, then dwc3_set_mode()
    will have to schedule drd_work and by then dwc3_debugfs_init()
    could have already been invoked.  Even if the initial mode is
    peripheral, dwc3_gadget_init() happens after the DebugFS files
    are created, and worse so if the initial state is host and the
    controller switches to peripheral much later.  And secondly,
    even if the gadget endpoints' debug entries were successfully
    created, if the controller exits peripheral mode, its dwc3_eps
    are freed so the debug files would now hold stale references.
    
    So it is best if the DebugFS endpoint entries are created and
    removed dynamically at the same time the underlying dwc3_eps are.
    Do this by calling dwc3_debugfs_create_endpoint_dir() as each
    endpoint is created, and conversely remove the DebugFS entry when
    the endpoint is freed.

    Go through all platforms drivers which use stmmac_probe_config_dt(),
    none of them disable clocks manually, so it's safe to disable them in
    stmmac_remove_config_dt().

    mm/slub: actually fix freelist pointer vs redzoning
    
    commit e41a49fadbc80b60b48d3c095d9e2ee7ef7c9a8e upstream.
    
    It turns out that SLUB redzoning ("slub_debug=Z") checks from
    s->object_size rather than from s->inuse (which is normally bumped to
    make room for the freelist pointer), so a cache created with an object
    size less than 24 would have the freelist pointer written beyond
    s->object_size, causing the redzone to be corrupted by the freelist
    pointer.  This was very visible with "slub_debug=ZF":

    mm/slub: fix redzoning for small allocations
    
    commit 74c1d3e081533825f2611e46edea1fcdc0701985 upstream.
    
    The redzone area for SLUB exists between s->object_size and s->inuse
    (which is at least the word-aligned object_size).  If a cache were
    created with an object_size smaller than sizeof(void *), the in-object
    stored freelist pointer would overwrite the redzone (e.g.  with boot
    param "slub_debug=ZF"):
    
      BUG test (Tainted: G    B            ): Right Redzone overwritten
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Store the freelist pointer out of line when object_size is smaller than
    sizeof(void *) and redzoning is enabled.
    
    Additionally remove the "smaller than sizeof(void *)" check under
    CONFIG_DEBUG_VM in kmem_cache_sanity_check() as it is now redundant:
    SLAB and SLOB both handle small sizes.
    
    (Note that no caches within this size range are known to exist in the
    kernel currently.)

    mm/slub: clarify verification reporting
    
    commit 8669dbab2ae56085c128894b181c2aa50f97e368 upstream.
    
    Patch series "Actually fix freelist pointer vs redzoning", v4.
    
    This fixes redzoning vs the freelist pointer (both for middle-position
    and very small caches).  Both are "theoretical" fixes, in that I see no
    evidence of such small-sized caches actually be used in the kernel, but
    that's no reason to let the bugs continue to exist, especially since
    people doing local development keep tripping over it.  :)
    
    This patch (of 3):
    
    Instead of repeating "Redzone" and "Poison", clarify which sides of
    those zones got tripped.  Additionally fix column alignment in the
    trailer.
    
    Before:
    
      BUG test (Tainted: G    B            ): Redzone overwritten
      ...
      Redzone (____ptrval____): bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb      ........
      Object (____ptrval____): f6 f4 a5 40 1d e8            ...@..
      Redzone (____ptrval____): 1a aa                        ..
      Padding (____ptrval____): 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00      ........
    
    After:
    
      BUG test (Tainted: G    B            ): Right Redzone overwritten
      ...
      Redzone  (____ptrval____): bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb      ........
      Object   (____ptrval____): f6 f4 a5 40 1d e8            ...@..
      Redzone  (____ptrval____): 1a aa                        ..
      Padding  (____ptrval____): 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00      ........
    
    The earlier commits that slowly resulted in the "Before" reporting were:

    mm/swap: fix pte_same_as_swp() not removing uffd-wp bit when compare
    
    commit 099dd6878b9b12d6bbfa6bf29ce0c8ddd38f6901 upstream.
    
    I found it by pure code review, that pte_same_as_swp() of unuse_vma()
    didn't take uffd-wp bit into account when comparing ptes.
    pte_same_as_swp() returning false negative could cause failure to
    swapoff swap ptes that was wr-protected by userfaultfd.

    net: bridge: fix vlan tunnel dst refcnt when egressing
    
    commit cfc579f9d89af4ada58c69b03bcaa4887840f3b3 upstream.
    
    The egress tunnel code uses dst_clone() and directly sets the result
    which is wrong because the entry might have 0 refcnt or be already deleted,
    causing number of problems. It also triggers the WARN_ON() in dst_hold()[1]
    when a refcnt couldn't be taken. Fix it by using dst_hold_safe() and
    checking if a reference was actually taken before setting the dst.

    net: bridge: fix vlan tunnel dst null pointer dereference
    
    commit 58e2071742e38f29f051b709a5cca014ba51166f upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a tunnel_dst null pointer dereference due to lockless
    access in the tunnel egress path. When deleting a vlan tunnel the
    tunnel_dst pointer is set to NULL without waiting a grace period (i.e.
    while it's still usable) and packets egressing are dereferencing it
    without checking. Use READ/WRITE_ONCE to annotate the lockless use of
    tunnel_id, use RCU for accessing tunnel_dst and make sure it is read
    only once and checked in the egress path. The dst is already properly RCU
    protected so we don't need to do anything fancy than to make sure
    tunnel_id and tunnel_dst are read only once and checked in the egress path.

    commit c364df2489b8ef2f5e3159b1dff1ff1fdb16040d upstream.
    
    Just as the initial check, we need to ensure num_frag+1 buffers available,
    as that is the number of buffers we are going to use.
    
    This fixes a buffer overflow, which might be seen during heavy network
    load. Complete lockup of TEMAC was reproducible within about 10 minutes of
    a particular load.

    net: ll_temac: Make sure to free skb when it is completely used
    
    commit 6aa32217a9a446275440ee8724b1ecaf1838df47 upstream.
    
    With the skb pointer piggy-backed on the TX BD, we have a simple and
    efficient way to free the skb buffer when the frame has been transmitted.
    But in order to avoid freeing the skb while there are still fragments from
    the skb in use, we need to piggy-back on the TX BD of the skb, not the
    first.
    
    Without this, we are doing use-after-free on the DMA side, when the first
    BD of a multi TX BD packet is seen as completed in xmit_done, and the
    remaining BDs are still being processed.

    cfg80211: avoid double free of PMSR request
    
    commit 0288e5e16a2e18f0b7e61a2b70d9037fc6e4abeb upstream.
    
    If cfg80211_pmsr_process_abort() moves all the PMSR requests that
    need to be freed into a local list before aborting and freeing them.
    As a result, it is possible that cfg80211_pmsr_complete() will run in
    parallel and free the same PMSR request.
    
    Fix it by freeing the request in cfg80211_pmsr_complete() only if it
    is still in the original pmsr list.

    mac80211: Fix NULL ptr deref for injected rate info
    
    commit bddc0c411a45d3718ac535a070f349be8eca8d48 upstream.
    
    The commit cb17ed29a7a5 ("mac80211: parse radiotap header when selecting Tx
    queue") moved the code to validate the radiotap header from
    ieee80211_monitor_start_xmit to ieee80211_parse_tx_radiotap. This made is
    possible to share more code with the new Tx queue selection code for
    injected frames. But at the same time, it now required the call of
    ieee80211_parse_tx_radiotap at the beginning of functions which wanted to
    handle the radiotap header. And this broke the rate parser for radiotap
    header parser.
    
    The radiotap parser for rates is operating most of the time only on the
    data in the actual radiotap header. But for the 802.11a/b/g rates, it must
    also know the selected band from the chandef information. But this
    information is only written to the ieee80211_tx_info at the end of the
    ieee80211_monitor_start_xmit - long after ieee80211_parse_tx_radiotap was
    already called. The info->band information was therefore always 0
    (NL80211_BAND_2GHZ) when the parser code tried to access it.
    
    For a 5GHz only device, injecting a frame with 802.11a rates would cause a
    NULL pointer dereference because local->hw.wiphy->bands[NL80211_BAND_2GHZ]
    would most likely have been NULL when the radiotap parser searched for the
    correct rate index of the driver.

    crash_core, vmcoreinfo: append 'SECTION_SIZE_BITS' to vmcoreinfo
    
    commit 4f5aecdff25f59fb5ea456d5152a913906ecf287 upstream.
    
    As mentioned in kernel commit 1d50e5d0c505 ("crash_core, vmcoreinfo:
    Append 'MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS' to vmcoreinfo"), SECTION_SIZE_BITS in the
    formula:
    
        #define SECTIONS_SHIFT    (MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS - SECTION_SIZE_BITS)
    
    Besides SECTIONS_SHIFT, SECTION_SIZE_BITS is also used to calculate
    PAGES_PER_SECTION in makedumpfile just like kernel.
    
    Unfortunately, this arch-dependent macro SECTION_SIZE_BITS changes, e.g.
    recently in kernel commit f0b13ee23241 ("arm64/sparsemem: reduce
    SECTION_SIZE_BITS").  But user space wants a stable interface to get
    this info.  Such info is impossible to be deduced from a crashdump
    vmcore.  Hence append SECTION_SIZE_BITS to vmcoreinfo.

    x86/fpu: Invalidate FPU state after a failed XRSTOR from a user buffer
    
    commit d8778e393afa421f1f117471144f8ce6deb6953a upstream.
    
    Both Intel and AMD consider it to be architecturally valid for XRSTOR to
    fail with #PF but nonetheless change the register state.  The actual
    conditions under which this might occur are unclear [1], but it seems
    plausible that this might be triggered if one sibling thread unmaps a page
    and invalidates the shared TLB while another sibling thread is executing
    XRSTOR on the page in question.
    
    __fpu__restore_sig() can execute XRSTOR while the hardware registers
    are preserved on behalf of a different victim task (using the
    fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx mechanism), and, in theory, XRSTOR could fail but
    modify the registers.
    
    If this happens, then there is a window in which __fpu__restore_sig()
    could schedule out and the victim task could schedule back in without
    reloading its own FPU registers. This would result in part of the FPU
    state that __fpu__restore_sig() was attempting to load leaking into the
    victim task's user-visible state.
    
    Invalidate preserved FPU registers on XRSTOR failure to prevent this
    situation from corrupting any state.
    
    [1] Frequent readers of the errata lists might imagine "complex
        microarchitectural conditions".

    x86/fpu: Prevent state corruption in __fpu__restore_sig()
    
    commit 484cea4f362e1eeb5c869abbfb5f90eae6421b38 upstream.
    
    The non-compacted slowpath uses __copy_from_user() and copies the entire
    user buffer into the kernel buffer, verbatim.  This means that the kernel
    buffer may now contain entirely invalid state on which XRSTOR will #GP.
    validate_user_xstate_header() can detect some of that corruption, but that
    leaves the onus on callers to clear the buffer.
    
    Prior to XSAVES support, it was possible just to reinitialize the buffer,
    completely, but with supervisor states that is not longer possible as the
    buffer clearing code split got it backwards. Fixing that is possible but
    not corrupting the state in the first place is more robust.
    
    Avoid corruption of the kernel XSAVE buffer by using copy_user_to_xstate()
    which validates the XSAVE header contents before copying the actual states
    to the kernel. copy_user_to_xstate() was previously only called for
    compacted-format kernel buffers, but it works for both compacted and
    non-compacted forms.
    
    Using it for the non-compacted form is slower because of multiple
    __copy_from_user() operations, but that cost is less important than robust
    code in an already slow path.

    x86/pkru: Write hardware init value to PKRU when xstate is init
    
    commit 510b80a6a0f1a0d114c6e33bcea64747d127973c upstream.
    
    When user space brings PKRU into init state, then the kernel handling is
    broken:
    
      T1 user space
         xsave(state)
         state.header.xfeatures &= ~XFEATURE_MASK_PKRU;
         xrstor(state)
    
      T1 -> kernel
         schedule()
           XSAVE(S) -> T1->xsave.header.xfeatures[PKRU] == 0
           T1->flags |= TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD;
    
           wrpkru();
    
         schedule()
           ...
           pk = get_xsave_addr(&T1->fpu->state.xsave, XFEATURE_PKRU);
           if (pk)
             wrpkru(pk->pkru);
           else
             wrpkru(DEFAULT_PKRU);
    
    Because the xfeatures bit is 0 and therefore the value in the xsave
    storage is not valid, get_xsave_addr() returns NULL and switch_to()
    writes the default PKRU. -> FAIL #1!
    
    So that wrecks any copy_to/from_user() on the way back to user space
    which hits memory which is protected by the default PKRU value.
    
    Assumed that this does not fail (pure luck) then T1 goes back to user
    space and because TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD is set it ends up in
    
      switch_fpu_return()
          __fpregs_load_activate()
            if (!fpregs_state_valid()) {
             load_XSTATE_from_task();
            }
    
    But if nothing touched the FPU between T1 scheduling out and back in,
    then the fpregs_state is still valid which means switch_fpu_return()
    does nothing and just clears TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD. Back to user space with
    DEFAULT_PKRU loaded. -> FAIL #2!
    
    The fix is simple: if get_xsave_addr() returns NULL then set the
    PKRU value to 0 instead of the restrictive default PKRU value in
    init_pkru_value.

    x86/ioremap: Map EFI-reserved memory as encrypted for SEV
    
    commit 8d651ee9c71bb12fc0c8eb2786b66cbe5aa3e43b upstream.
    
    Some drivers require memory that is marked as EFI boot services
    data. In order for this memory to not be re-used by the kernel
    after ExitBootServices(), efi_mem_reserve() is used to preserve it
    by inserting a new EFI memory descriptor and marking it with the
    EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute.
    
    Under SEV, memory marked with the EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute needs to
    be mapped encrypted by Linux, otherwise the kernel might crash at boot
    like below:
    
      EFI Variables Facility v0.08 2004-May-17

    Expand the __ioremap_check_other() function to additionally check for

    should be mapped encrypted for an SEV guest.

    x86/mm: Avoid truncating memblocks for SGX memory
    
    commit 28e5e44aa3f4e0e0370864ed008fb5e2d85f4dc8 upstream.
    
    tl;dr:
    
    Several SGX users reported seeing the following message on NUMA systems:
    
      sgx: [Firmware Bug]: Unable to map EPC section to online node. Fallback to the NUMA node 0.
    
    This turned out to be the memblock code mistakenly throwing away SGX
    memory.
    
    === Full Changelog ===
    
    The 'max_pfn' variable represents the highest known RAM address.  It can
    be used, for instance, to quickly determine for which physical addresses
    there is mem_map[] space allocated.  The numa_meminfo code makes an
    effort to throw out ("trim") all memory blocks which are above 'max_pfn'.
    
    SGX memory is not considered RAM (it is marked as "Reserved" in the
    e820) and is not taken into account by max_pfn. Despite this, SGX memory
    areas have NUMA affinity and are enumerated in the ACPI SRAT table. The
    existing SGX code uses the numa_meminfo mechanism to look up the NUMA
    affinity for its memory areas.
    
    In cases where SGX memory was above max_pfn (usually just the one EPC
    section in the last highest NUMA node), the numa_memblock is truncated
    at 'max_pfn', which is below the SGX memory.  When the SGX code tries to
    look up the affinity of this memory, it fails and produces an error message:
    
      sgx: [Firmware Bug]: Unable to map EPC section to online node. Fallback to the NUMA node 0.
    
    and assigns the memory to NUMA node 0.
    
    Instead of silently truncating the memory block at 'max_pfn' and
    dropping the SGX memory, add the truncated portion to
    'numa_reserved_meminfo'.  This allows the SGX code to later determine
    the NUMA affinity of its 'Reserved' area.
    
    Before, numa_meminfo looked like this (from 'crash'):
    
      blk = { start =          0x0, end = 0x2080000000, nid = 0x0 }
            { start = 0x2080000000, end = 0x4000000000, nid = 0x1 }
    
    numa_reserved_meminfo is empty.
    
    With this, numa_meminfo looks like this:
    
      blk = { start =          0x0, end = 0x2080000000, nid = 0x0 }
            { start = 0x2080000000, end = 0x4000000000, nid = 0x1 }
    
    and numa_reserved_meminfo has an entry for node 1's SGX memory:
    
      blk =  { start = 0x4000000000, end = 0x4080000000, nid = 0x1 }

    ARCv2: save ABI registers across signal handling
    
    commit 96f1b00138cb8f04c742c82d0a7c460b2202e887 upstream.
    
    ARCv2 has some configuration dependent registers (r30, r58, r59) which
    could be targetted by the compiler. To keep the ABI stable, these were
    unconditionally part of the glibc ABI
    (sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/arc/sys/ucontext.h:mcontext_t) however we
    missed populating them (by saving/restoring them across signal
    handling).
    
    This patch fixes the issue by
     - adding arcv2 ABI regs to kernel struct sigcontext
     - populating them during signal handling
    
    Change to struct sigcontext might seem like a glibc ABI change (although
    it primarily uses ucontext_t:mcontext_t) but the fact is
     - it has only been extended (existing fields are not touched)
     - the old sigcontext was ABI incomplete to begin with anyways

    s390/ap: Fix hanging ioctl caused by wrong msg counter
    
    commit e73a99f3287a740a07d6618e9470f4d6cb217da8 upstream.
    
    When a AP queue is switched to soft offline, all pending
    requests are purged out of the pending requests list and
    'received' by the upper layer like zcrypt device drivers.
    This is also done for requests which are already enqueued
    into the firmware queue. A request in a firmware queue
    may eventually produce an response message, but there is
    no waiting process any more. However, the response was
    counted with the queue_counter and as this counter was
    reset to 0 with the offline switch, the pending response
    caused the queue_counter to get negative. The next request
    increased this counter to 0 (instead of 1) which caused
    the ap code to assume there is nothing to receive and so
    the response for this valid request was never tried to
    fetch from the firmware queue.
    
    This all caused a queue to not work properly after a
    switch offline/online and in the end processes to hang
    forever when trying to send a crypto request after an
    queue offline/online switch cicle.
    
    Fixed by a) making sure the counter does not drop below 0
    and b) on a successful enqueue of a message has at least
    a value of 1.
    
    Additionally a warning is emitted, when a reply can't get
    assigned to a waiting process. This may be normal operation
    (process had timeout or has been killed) but may give a
    hint that something unexpected happened (like this odd
    behavior described above).

    KVM: x86/mmu: Calculate and check "full" mmu_role for nested MMU
    
    commit 654430efde27248be563df9a88631204b5fe2df2 upstream.
    
    Calculate and check the full mmu_role when initializing the MMU context
    for the nested MMU, where "full" means the bits and pieces of the role
    that aren't handled by kvm_calc_mmu_role_common().  While the nested MMU
    isn't used for shadow paging, things like the number of levels in the
    guest's page tables are surprisingly important when walking the guest
    page tables.  Failure to reinitialize the nested MMU context if L2's
    paging mode changes can result in unexpected and/or missed page faults,
    and likely other explosions.
    
    E.g. if an L1 vCPU is running both a 32-bit PAE L2 and a 64-bit L2, the
    "common" role calculation will yield the same role for both L2s.  If the
    64-bit L2 is run after the 32-bit PAE L2, L0 will fail to reinitialize
    the nested MMU context, ultimately resulting in a bad walk of L2's page
    tables as the MMU will still have a guest root_level of PT32E_ROOT_LEVEL.

    KVM: x86: Immediately reset the MMU context when the SMM flag is cleared
    
    commit 78fcb2c91adfec8ce3a2ba6b4d0dda89f2f4a7c6 upstream.
    
    Immediately reset the MMU context when the vCPU's SMM flag is cleared so
    that the SMM flag in the MMU role is always synchronized with the vCPU's
    flag.  If RSM fails (which isn't correctly emulated), KVM will bail
    without calling post_leave_smm() and leave the MMU in a bad state.
    
    The bad MMU role can lead to a NULL pointer dereference when grabbing a
    shadow page's rmap for a page fault as the initial lookups for the gfn
    will happen with the vCPU's SMM flag (=0), whereas the rmap lookup will
    use the shadow page's SMM flag, which comes from the MMU (=1).  SMM has
    an entirely different set of memslots, and so the initial lookup can find
    a memslot (SMM=0) and then explode on the rmap memslot lookup (SMM=1).

    PCI: Work around Huawei Intelligent NIC VF FLR erratum
    
    commit ce00322c2365e1f7b0312f2f493539c833465d97 upstream.
    
    pcie_flr() starts a Function Level Reset (FLR), waits 100ms (the maximum
    time allowed for FLR completion by PCIe r5.0, sec 6.6.2), and waits for the
    FLR to complete.  It assumes the FLR is complete when a config read returns
    valid data.
    
    When we do an FLR on several Huawei Intelligent NIC VFs at the same time,
    firmware on the NIC processes them serially.  The VF may respond to config
    reads before the firmware has completed its reset processing.  If we bind a
    driver to the VF (e.g., by assigning the VF to a virtual machine) in the
    interval between the successful config read and completion of the firmware
    reset processing, the NIC VF driver may fail to load.
    
    Prevent this driver failure by waiting for the NIC firmware to complete its
    reset processing.  Not all NIC firmware supports this feature.

    PCI: Add ACS quirk for Broadcom BCM57414 NIC
    
    commit db2f77e2bd99dbd2fb23ddde58f0fae392fe3338 upstream.
    
    The Broadcom BCM57414 NIC may be a multi-function device.  While it does
    not advertise an ACS capability, peer-to-peer transactions are not possible
    between the individual functions, so it is safe to treat them as fully
    isolated.
    
    Add an ACS quirk for this device so the functions can be in independent
    IOMMU groups and attached individually to userspace applications using
    VFIO.

    PCI: aardvark: Fix kernel panic during PIO transfer
    
    commit f18139966d072dab8e4398c95ce955a9742e04f7 upstream.
    
    Trying to start a new PIO transfer by writing value 0 in PIO_START register
    when previous transfer has not yet completed (which is indicated by value 1
    in PIO_START) causes an External Abort on CPU, which results in kernel
    panic:
    
        SError Interrupt on CPU0, code 0xbf000002 -- SError
        Kernel panic - not syncing: Asynchronous SError Interrupt
    
    To prevent kernel panic, it is required to reject a new PIO transfer when
    previous one has not finished yet.
    
    If previous PIO transfer is not finished yet, the kernel may issue a new
    PIO request only if the previous PIO transfer timed out.
    
    In the past the root cause of this issue was incorrectly identified (as it
    often happens during link retraining or after link down event) and special
    hack was implemented in Trusted Firmware to catch all SError events in EL3,
    to ignore errors with code 0xbf000002 and not forwarding any other errors
    to kernel and instead throw panic from EL3 Trusted Firmware handler.
    
    Links to discussion and patches about this issue:
    https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/commit/?id=3c7dcdac5c50
    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20190316161243.29517-1-repk@triplefau.lt/
    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/971be151d24312cc533989a64bd454b4@www.loen.fr/
    https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/1541
    
    But the real cause was the fact that during link retraining or after link
    down event the PIO transfer may take longer time, up to the 1.44s until it
    times out. This increased probability that a new PIO transfer would be
    issued by kernel while previous one has not finished yet.
    
    After applying this change into the kernel, it is possible to revert the
    mentioned TF-A hack and SError events do not have to be caught in TF-A EL3.

    PCI: Mark some NVIDIA GPUs to avoid bus reset
    
    commit 4c207e7121fa92b66bf1896bf8ccb9edfb0f9731 upstream.
    
    Some NVIDIA GPU devices do not work with SBR.  Triggering SBR leaves the
    device inoperable for the current system boot. It requires a system
    hard-reboot to get the GPU device back to normal operating condition
    post-SBR. For the affected devices, enable NO_BUS_RESET quirk to avoid the
    issue.
    
    This issue will be fixed in the next generation of hardware.

    automatically disables LTSSM when Secondary Bus Reset is received and
    device stops working.  Prevent bus reset for these devices.  With this
    change, the device can be assigned to VMs with VFIO, but it will leak state
    between VMs.

    tracing: Do no increment trace_clock_global() by one
    
    commit 89529d8b8f8daf92d9979382b8d2eb39966846ea upstream.
    
    The trace_clock_global() tries to make sure the events between CPUs is
    somewhat in order. A global value is used and updated by the latest read
    of a clock. If one CPU is ahead by a little, and is read by another CPU, a
    lock is taken, and if the timestamp of the other CPU is behind, it will
    simply use the other CPUs timestamp.
    
    The lock is also only taken with a "trylock" due to tracing, and strange
    recursions can happen. The lock is not taken at all in NMI context.
    
    In the case where the lock is not able to be taken, the non synced
    timestamp is returned. But it will not be less than the saved global
    timestamp.
    
    The problem arises because when the time goes "backwards" the time
    returned is the saved timestamp plus 1. If the lock is not taken, and the
    plus one to the timestamp is returned, there's a small race that can cause
    the time to go backwards!

                                        trylock(clock_lock) [ success ]

            ts = global_ts + 1 [ 1001 ]
    
        trylock(clock_lock) [ fail ]
    
        return ts [ 1001]
     }
                                        unlock(clock_lock);
                                        return ts; [ 1000 ]
                                    }
    
     trace_clock_global() {
        ts = clock() [ 1000 ]
        if (ts < global_ts) [ false 1000 == 1000 ]
    
        trylock(clock_lock) [ success ]
        global_ts = ts; [ 1000 ]
        unlock(clock_lock)
    
        return ts; [ 1000 ]
     }
    
    The above case shows to reads of trace_clock_global() on the same CPU, but
    the second read returns one less than the first read. That is, time when
    backwards, and this is not what is allowed by trace_clock_global().
    
    This was triggered by heavy tracing and the ring buffer checker that tests
    for the clock going backwards:
    
     Ring buffer clock went backwards: 20613921464 -> 20613921463

    tracing: Do not stop recording comms if the trace file is being read
    
    commit 4fdd595e4f9a1ff6d93ec702eaecae451cfc6591 upstream.
    
    A while ago, when the "trace" file was opened, tracing was stopped, and
    code was added to stop recording the comms to saved_cmdlines, for mapping
    of the pids to the task name.
    
    Code has been added that only records the comm if a trace event occurred,
    and there's no reason to not trace it if the trace file is opened.

    tracing: Do not stop recording cmdlines when tracing is off
    
    commit 85550c83da421fb12dc1816c45012e1e638d2b38 upstream.
    
    The saved_cmdlines is used to map pids to the task name, such that the
    output of the tracing does not just show pids, but also gives a human
    readable name for the task.
    
    If the name is not mapped, the output looks like this:
    
        <...>-1316          [005] ...2   132.044039: ...
    
    Instead of this:
    
        gnome-shell-1316    [005] ...2   132.044039: ...
    
    The names are updated when tracing is running, but are skipped if tracing
    is stopped. Unfortunately, this stops the recording of the names if the
    top level tracer is stopped, and not if there's other tracers active.
    
    The recording of a name only happens when a new event is written into a
    ring buffer, so there is no need to test if tracing is on or not. If
    tracing is off, then no event is written and no need to test if tracing is
    off or not.
    
    Remove the check, as it hides the names of tasks for events in the
    instance buffers.

    usb: chipidea: imx: Fix Battery Charger 1.2 CDP detection
    
    commit c6d580d96f140596d69220f60ce0cfbea4ee5c0f upstream.
    
    i.MX8MM cannot detect certain CDP USB HUBs. usbmisc_imx.c driver is not
    following CDP timing requirements defined by USB BC 1.2 specification
    and section 3.2.4 Detection Timing CDP.
    
    During Primary Detection the i.MX device should turn on VDP_SRC and
    IDM_SINK for a minimum of 40ms (TVDPSRC_ON). After a time of TVDPSRC_ON,
    the i.MX is allowed to check the status of the D- line. Current
    implementation is waiting between 1ms and 2ms, and certain BC 1.2
    complaint USB HUBs cannot be detected. Increase delay to 40ms allowing
    enough time for primary detection.
    
    During secondary detection the i.MX is required to disable VDP_SRC and
    IDM_SNK, and enable VDM_SRC and IDP_SINK for at least 40ms (TVDMSRC_ON).
    
    Current implementation is not disabling VDP_SRC and IDM_SNK, introduce
    disable sequence in imx7d_charger_secondary_detection() function.
    
    VDM_SRC and IDP_SINK should be enabled for at least 40ms (TVDMSRC_ON).
    Increase delay allowing enough time for detection.

    usb: core: hub: Disable autosuspend for Cypress CY7C65632
    
    commit a7d8d1c7a7f73e780aa9ae74926ae5985b2f895f upstream.
    
    The Cypress CY7C65632 appears to have an issue with auto suspend and
    detecting devices, not too dissimilar to the SMSC 5534B hub. It is
    easiest to reproduce by connecting multiple mass storage devices to
    the hub at the same time. On a Lenovo Yoga, around 1 in 3 attempts
    result in the devices not being detected. It is however possible to
    make them appear using lsusb -v.
    
    Disabling autosuspend for this hub resolves the issue.

    can: mcba_usb: fix memory leak in mcba_usb
    
    commit 91c02557174be7f72e46ed7311e3bea1939840b0 upstream.
    
    Syzbot reported memory leak in SocketCAN driver for Microchip CAN BUS
    Analyzer Tool. The problem was in unfreed usb_coherent.
    
    In mcba_usb_start() 20 coherent buffers are allocated and there is
    nothing, that frees them:
    
    1) In callback function the urb is resubmitted and that's all
    2) In disconnect function urbs are simply killed, but URB_FREE_BUFFER
       is not set (see mcba_usb_start) and this flag cannot be used with
       coherent buffers.
    
    Fail log:
    | [ 1354.053291][ T8413] mcba_usb 1-1:0.0 can0: device disconnected
    | [ 1367.059384][ T8420] kmemleak: 20 new suspected memory leaks (see /sys/kernel/debug/kmem)
    
    So, all allocated buffers should be freed with usb_free_coherent()
    explicitly
    
    NOTE:
    The same pattern for allocating and freeing coherent buffers
    is used in drivers/net/can/usb/kvaser_usb/kvaser_usb_core.c

    This patch fixes a Use-after-Free found by the syzbot.
    
    The problem is that a skb is taken from the per-session skb queue,
    without incrementing the ref count. This leads to a Use-after-Free if
    the skb is taken concurrently from the session queue due to a CTS.

    ... in such circumstances, we do not want to mark the instruction as seen given

    safety regardless.
    
    With the patch as-is all the insns that have been marked as seen before the
    patch will also be marked as seen after the patch (just with a potentially
    different non-zero count). An upcoming patch will also verify paths that are
    unreachable in the non-speculative domain, hence this extension is needed.

    bpf: Inherit expanded/patched seen count from old aux data
    
    [ Upstream commit d203b0fd863a2261e5d00b97f3d060c4c2a6db71 ]
    
    Instead of relying on current env->pass_cnt, use the seen count from the
    old aux data in adjust_insn_aux_data(), and expand it to the new range of
    patched instructions. This change is valid given we always expand 1:n
    with n>=1, so what applies to the old/original instruction needs to apply
    for the replacement as well.
    
    Not relying on env->pass_cnt is a prerequisite for a later change where we

    irqchip/gic-v3: Workaround inconsistent PMR setting on NMI entry
    
    [ Upstream commit 382e6e177bc1c02473e56591fe5083ae1e4904f6 ]
    
    The arm64 entry code suffers from an annoying issue on taking
    a NMI, as it sets PMR to a value that actually allows IRQs
    to be acknowledged. This is done for consistency with other parts
    of the code, and is in the process of being fixed. This shouldn't
    be a problem, as we are not enabling interrupts whilst in NMI
    context.
    
    However, in the infortunate scenario that we took a spurious NMI
    (retired before the read of IAR) *and* that there is an IRQ pending
    at the same time, we'll ack the IRQ in NMI context. Too bad.
    
    In order to avoid deadlocks while running something like perf,
    teach the GICv3 driver about this situation: if we were in
    a context where no interrupt should have fired, transiently
    set PMR to a value that only allows NMIs before acking the pending
    interrupt, and restore the original value after that.
    
    This papers over the core issue for the time being, and makes
    NMIs great again. Sort of.

    mm: relocate 'write_protect_seq' in struct mm_struct
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e3025434a6ba090c85871a1d4080ff784109e1f ]
    
    0day robot reported a 9.2% regression for will-it-scale mmap1 test
    case[1], caused by commit 57efa1fe5957 ("mm/gup: prevent gup_fast from
    racing with COW during fork").
    
    Further debug shows the regression is due to that commit changes the
    offset of hot fields 'mmap_lock' inside structure 'mm_struct', thus some
    cache alignment changes.
    
    From the perf data, the contention for 'mmap_lock' is very severe and
    takes around 95% cpu cycles, and it is a rw_semaphore
    
            struct rw_semaphore {
                    atomic_long_t count;    /* 8 bytes */
                    atomic_long_t owner;    /* 8 bytes */
                    struct optimistic_spin_queue osq; /* spinner MCS lock */
                    ...
    
    Before commit 57efa1fe5957 adds the 'write_protect_seq', it happens to
    have a very optimal cache alignment layout, as Linus explained:
    
     "and before the addition of the 'write_protect_seq' field, the
      mmap_sem was at offset 120 in 'struct mm_struct'.
    
      Which meant that count and owner were in two different cachelines,
      and then when you have contention and spend time in
      rwsem_down_write_slowpath(), this is probably *exactly* the kind
      of layout you want.
    
      Because first the rwsem_write_trylock() will do a cmpxchg on the
      first cacheline (for the optimistic fast-path), and then in the
      case of contention, rwsem_down_write_slowpath() will just access
      the second cacheline.
    
      Which is probably just optimal for a load that spends a lot of
      time contended - new waiters touch that first cacheline, and then
      they queue themselves up on the second cacheline."
    
    After the commit, the rw_semaphore is at offset 128, which means the
    'count' and 'owner' fields are now in the same cacheline, and causes
    more cache bouncing.
    
    Currently there are 3 "#ifdef CONFIG_XXX" before 'mmap_lock' which will
    affect its offset:
    
      CONFIG_MMU
      CONFIG_MEMBARRIER
      CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_COMPAT_MMAP_BASES
    
    The layout above is on 64 bits system with 0day's default kernel config
    (similar to RHEL-8.3's config), in which all these 3 options are 'y'.
    And the layout can vary with different kernel configs.
    
    Relayouting a structure is usually a double-edged sword, as sometimes it
    can helps one case, but hurt other cases.  For this case, one solution
    is, as the newly added 'write_protect_seq' is a 4 bytes long seqcount_t
    (when CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=n), placing it into an existing 4 bytes
    hole in 'mm_struct' will not change other fields' alignment, while
    restoring the regression.

    radeon: use memcpy_to/fromio for UVD fw upload
    
    [ Upstream commit ab8363d3875a83f4901eb1cc00ce8afd24de6c85 ]
    
    I met a gpu addr bug recently and the kernel log
    tells me the pc is memcpy/memset and link register is
    radeon_uvd_resume.
    
    As we know, in some architectures, optimized memcpy/memset
    may not work well on device memory. Trival memcpy_toio/memset_io
    can fix this problem.
    
    BTW, amdgpu has already done it in:
    commit ba0b2275a678 ("drm/amdgpu: use memcpy_to/fromio for UVD fw upload"),
    that's why it has no this issue on the same gpu and platform.

    drm/sun4i: dw-hdmi: Make HDMI PHY into a platform device
    
    [ Upstream commit 9bf3797796f570b34438235a6a537df85832bdad ]
    
    On sunxi boards that use HDMI output, HDMI device probe keeps being
    avoided indefinitely with these repeated messages in dmesg:
    
      platform 1ee0000.hdmi: probe deferral - supplier 1ef0000.hdmi-phy
        not ready
    
    There's a fwnode_link being created with fw_devlink=on between hdmi
    and hdmi-phy nodes, because both nodes have 'compatible' property set.
    
    Fw_devlink code assumes that nodes that have compatible property
    set will also have a device associated with them by some driver
    eventually. This is not the case with the current sun8i-hdmi
    driver.
    
    This commit makes sun8i-hdmi-phy into a proper platform device
    and fixes the display pipeline probe on sunxi boards that use HDMI.

    The power of "LDO2", "MICBIAS1" and "Mic Det Power" were powered off after
    the DAPM widgets were added, and these powers were set by the JD settings
    "RT5659_JD_HDA_HEADER" in the probe function. In the codec probe function,
    these powers were ignored to prevent them controlled by DAPM.

    The X1 Carbon Gen 9 uses two fans instead of one like the previous
    generation. This adds support for the second fan. It has been tested
    on my X1 Carbon Gen 9 (20XXS00100) and works fine.

    net: ethernet: fix potential use-after-free in ec_bhf_remove

    icmp: don't send out ICMP messages with a source address of 0.0.0.0
    
    [ Upstream commit 321827477360934dc040e9d3c626bf1de6c3ab3c ]
    
    When constructing ICMP response messages, the kernel will try to pick a
    suitable source address for the outgoing packet. However, if no IPv4
    addresses are configured on the system at all, this will fail and we end up
    producing an ICMP message with a source address of 0.0.0.0. This can happen
    on a box routing IPv4 traffic via v6 nexthops, for instance.
    
    Since 0.0.0.0 is not generally routable on the internet, there's a good
    chance that such ICMP messages will never make it back to the sender of the
    original packet that the ICMP message was sent in response to. This, in
    turn, can create connectivity and PMTUd problems for senders. Fortunately,
    RFC7600 reserves a dummy address to be used as a source for ICMP
    messages (192.0.0.8/32), so let's teach the kernel to substitute that
    address as a last resort if the regular source address selection procedure
    fails.
    
    Below is a quick example reproducing this issue with network namespaces:
    
    ip netns add ns0
    ip l add type veth peer netns ns0
    ip l set dev veth0 up
    ip a add 10.0.0.1/24 dev veth0
    ip a add fc00:dead:cafe:42::1/64 dev veth0
    ip r add 10.1.0.0/24 via inet6 fc00:dead:cafe:42::2
    ip -n ns0 l set dev veth0 up
    ip -n ns0 a add fc00:dead:cafe:42::2/64 dev veth0
    ip -n ns0 r add 10.0.0.0/24 via inet6 fc00:dead:cafe:42::1
    ip netns exec ns0 sysctl -w net.ipv4.icmp_ratelimit=0
    ip netns exec ns0 sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    tcpdump -tpni veth0 -c 2 icmp &
    ping -w 1 10.1.0.1 > /dev/null
    tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode
    listening on veth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes
    IP 10.0.0.1 > 10.1.0.1: ICMP echo request, id 29, seq 1, length 64
    IP 0.0.0.0 > 10.0.0.1: ICMP net 10.1.0.1 unreachable, length 92
    2 packets captured
    2 packets received by filter
    0 packets dropped by kernel
    
    With this patch the above capture changes to:
    IP 10.0.0.1 > 10.1.0.1: ICMP echo request, id 31127, seq 1, length 64
    IP 192.0.0.8 > 10.0.0.1: ICMP net 10.1.0.1 unreachable, length 92

    There is a missing bnxt_probe_phy() call in bnxt_fw_init_one() to
    rediscover the PHY capabilities after a firmware reset.  This can cause

    If an error occurs after a 'pci_enable_pcie_error_reporting()' call, it
    must be undone by a corresponding 'pci_disable_pcie_error_reporting()'
    call, as already done in the remove function.

    net/mlx5: Reset mkey index on creation
    
    [ Upstream commit 0232fc2ddcf4ffe01069fd1aa07922652120f44a ]
    
    Reset only the index part of the mkey and keep the variant part. On
    devlink reload, driver recreates mkeys, so the mkey index may change.
    Trying to preserve the variant part of the mkey, driver mistakenly
    merged the mkey index with current value. In case of a devlink reload,
    current value of index part is dirty, so the index may be corrupted.

    E-switch should be able to set the GUID of host PF vport.
    Currently it returns an error. This results in below error

    net/mlx5: E-Switch, Read PF mac address
    
    [ Upstream commit bbc8222dc49db8d49add0f27bcac33f4b92193dc ]
    
    External controller PF's MAC address is not read from the device during
    vport setup. Fail to read this results in showing all zeros to user
    while the factory programmed MAC is a valid value.
    
    $ devlink port show eth1 -jp
    {
        "port": {
            "pci/0000:03:00.0/196608": {

            }
        }
    }
    
    Hence, read it when enabling a vport.

    net/af_unix: fix a data-race in unix_dgram_sendmsg / unix_release_sock
    
    [ Upstream commit a494bd642d9120648b06bb7d28ce6d05f55a7819 ]
    
    While unix_may_send(sk, osk) is called while osk is locked, it appears
    unix_release_sock() can overwrite unix_peer() after this lock has been
    released, making KCSAN unhappy.
    
    Changing unix_release_sock() to access/change unix_peer()
    before lock is released should fix this issue.

    In commit 24803f38a5c0 ("igmp: do not remove igmp souce list info when set
    link down"), the ip_mc_clear_src() in ip_mc_destroy_dev() was removed,
    because it was also called in igmpv3_clear_delrec().
    
    Rough callgraph:
    
    inetdev_destroy
    -> ip_mc_destroy_dev
         -> igmpv3_clear_delrec
            -> ip_mc_clear_src
    -> RCU_INIT_POINTER(dev->ip_ptr, NULL)
    
    However, ip_mc_clear_src() called in igmpv3_clear_delrec() doesn't
    release in_dev->mc_list->sources. And RCU_INIT_POINTER() assigns the
    NULL to dev->ip_ptr. As a result, in_dev cannot be obtained through
    inetdev_by_index() and then in_dev->mc_list->sources cannot be released
    by ip_mc_del1_src() in the sock_close. Rough call sequence goes like:
    
    sock_close
    -> __sock_release
       -> inet_release
          -> ip_mc_drop_socket
             -> inetdev_by_index
             -> ip_mc_leave_src
                -> ip_mc_del_src
                   -> ip_mc_del1_src
    
    So we still need to call ip_mc_clear_src() in ip_mc_destroy_dev() to free
    in_dev->mc_list->sources.

    net: cdc_ncm: switch to eth%d interface naming
    
    [ Upstream commit c1a3d4067309451e68c33dbd356032549cc0bd8e ]
    
    This is meant to make the host side cdc_ncm interface consistently
    named just like the older CDC protocols: cdc_ether & cdc_ecm
    (and even rndis_host), which all use 'FLAG_ETHER | FLAG_POINTTOPOINT'.
    
    include/linux/usb/usbnet.h:
      #define FLAG_ETHER    0x0020          /* maybe use "eth%d" names */
      #define FLAG_WLAN     0x0080          /* use "wlan%d" names */
      #define FLAG_WWAN     0x0400          /* use "wwan%d" names */
      #define FLAG_POINTTOPOINT 0x1000      /* possibly use "usb%d" names */
    
    drivers/net/usb/usbnet.c @ line 1711:
      strcpy (net->name, "usb%d");
      ...
      // heuristic:  "usb%d" for links we know are two-host,
      // else "eth%d" when there's reasonable doubt.  userspace
      // can rename the link if it knows better.
      if ((dev->driver_info->flags & FLAG_ETHER) != 0 &&
          ((dev->driver_info->flags & FLAG_POINTTOPOINT) == 0 ||
           (net->dev_addr [0] & 0x02) == 0))
              strcpy (net->name, "eth%d");
      /* WLAN devices should always be named "wlan%d" */
      if ((dev->driver_info->flags & FLAG_WLAN) != 0)
              strcpy(net->name, "wlan%d");
      /* WWAN devices should always be named "wwan%d" */
      if ((dev->driver_info->flags & FLAG_WWAN) != 0)
              strcpy(net->name, "wwan%d");
    
    So by using ETHER | POINTTOPOINT the interface naming is
    either usb%d or eth%d based on the global uniqueness of the
    mac address of the device.
    
    Without this 2.5gbps ethernet dongles which all seem to use the cdc_ncm
    driver end up being called usb%d instead of eth%d even though they're
    definitely not two-host.  (All 1gbps & 5gbps ethernet usb dongles I've
    tested don't hit this problem due to use of different drivers, primarily
    r8152 and aqc111)
    
    Fixes tag is based purely on git blame, and is really just here to make
    sure this hits LTS branches newer than v4.5.

    [ Upstream commit 475b92f932168a78da8109acd10bfb7578b8f2bb ]
    
    Scaled PPM conversion to PPB may (on 64bit systems) result
    in a value larger than s32 can hold (freq/scaled_ppm is a long).
    This means the kernel will not correctly reject unreasonably
    high ->freq values (e.g. > 4294967295ppb, 281474976645 scaled PPM).
    
    The conversion is equivalent to a division by ~66 (65.536),
    so the value of ppb is always smaller than ppm, but not small
    enough to assume narrowing the type from long -> s32 is okay.
    
    Note that reasonable user space (e.g. ptp4l) will not use such
    high values, anyway, 4289046510ppb ~= 4.3x, so the fix is
    somewhat pedantic.

    bpf: Fix leakage under speculation on mispredicted branches
    
    [ Upstream commit 9183671af6dbf60a1219371d4ed73e23f43b49db ]
    
    The verifier only enumerates valid control-flow paths and skips paths that
    are unreachable in the non-speculative domain. And so it can miss issues
    under speculative execution on mispredicted branches.
    
    For example, a type confusion has been demonstrated with the following
    crafted program:
    
      // r0 = pointer to a map array entry
      // r6 = pointer to readable stack slot
      // r9 = scalar controlled by attacker
      1: r0 = *(u64 *)(r0) // cache miss
      2: if r0 != 0x0 goto line 4
      3: r6 = r9
      4: if r0 != 0x1 goto line 6
      5: r9 = *(u8 *)(r6)
      6: // leak r9
    
    Since line 3 runs iff r0 == 0 and line 5 runs iff r0 == 1, the verifier
    concludes that the pointer dereference on line 5 is safe. But: if the
    attacker trains both the branches to fall-through, such that the following
    is speculatively executed ...
    
      r6 = r9
      r9 = *(u8 *)(r6)
      // leak r9
    
    ... then the program will dereference an attacker-controlled value and could
    leak its content under speculative execution via side-channel. This requires
    to mistrain the branch predictor, which can be rather tricky, because the
    branches are mutually exclusive. However such training can be done at
    congruent addresses in user space using different branches that are not
    mutually exclusive. That is, by training branches in user space ...
    
      A:  if r0 != 0x0 goto line C
      B:  ...
      C:  if r0 != 0x0 goto line D
      D:  ...
    
    ... such that addresses A and C collide to the same CPU branch prediction
    entries in the PHT (pattern history table) as those of the BPF program's
    lines 2 and 4, respectively. A non-privileged attacker could simply brute
    force such collisions in the PHT until observing the attack succeeding.
    
    Alternative methods to mistrain the branch predictor are also possible that
    avoid brute forcing the collisions in the PHT. A reliable attack has been
    demonstrated, for example, using the following crafted program:
    
      // r0 = pointer to a [control] map array entry
      // r7 = *(u64 *)(r0 + 0), training/attack phase
      // r8 = *(u64 *)(r0 + 8), oob address
      // [...]
      // r0 = pointer to a [data] map array entry
      1: if r7 == 0x3 goto line 3
      2: r8 = r0
      // crafted sequence of conditional jumps to separate the conditional
      // branch in line 193 from the current execution flow
      3: if r0 != 0x0 goto line 5
      4: if r0 == 0x0 goto exit
      5: if r0 != 0x0 goto line 7
      6: if r0 == 0x0 goto exit
      [...]
      187: if r0 != 0x0 goto line 189
      188: if r0 == 0x0 goto exit
      // load any slowly-loaded value (due to cache miss in phase 3) ...
      189: r3 = *(u64 *)(r0 + 0x1200)
      // ... and turn it into known zero for verifier, while preserving slowly-
      // loaded dependency when executing:
      190: r3 &= 1
      191: r3 &= 2
      // speculatively bypassed phase dependency
      192: r7 += r3
      193: if r7 == 0x3 goto exit
      194: r4 = *(u8 *)(r8 + 0)
      // leak r4
    
    As can be seen, in training phase (phase != 0x3), the condition in line 1
    turns into false and therefore r8 with the oob address is overridden with
    the valid map value address, which in line 194 we can read out without
    issues. However, in attack phase, line 2 is skipped, and due to the cache
    miss in line 189 where the map value is (zeroed and later) added to the
    phase register, the condition in line 193 takes the fall-through path due
    to prior branch predictor training, where under speculation, it'll load the
    byte at oob address r8 (unknown scalar type at that point) which could then
    be leaked via side-channel.
    
    One way to mitigate these is to 'branch off' an unreachable path, meaning,
    the current verification path keeps following the is_branch_taken() path
    and we push the other branch to the verification stack. Given this is
    unreachable from the non-speculative domain, this branch's vstate is
    explicitly marked as speculative. This is needed for two reasons: i) if
    this path is solely seen from speculative execution, then we later on still
    want the dead code elimination to kick in in order to sanitize these
    instructions with jmp-1s, and ii) to ensure that paths walked in the
    non-speculative domain are not pruned from earlier walks of paths walked in
    the speculative domain. Additionally, for robustness, we mark the registers
    which have been part of the conditional as unknown in the speculative path
    given there should be no assumptions made on their content.
    
    The fix in here mitigates type confusion attacks described earlier due to
    i) all code paths in the BPF program being explored and ii) existing
    verifier logic already ensuring that given memory access instruction
    references one specific data structure.
    
    An alternative to this fix that has also been looked at in this scope was to
    mark aux->alu_state at the jump instruction with a BPF_JMP_TAKEN state as
    well as direction encoding (always-goto, always-fallthrough, unknown), such
    that mixing of different always-* directions themselves as well as mixing of
    always-* with unknown directions would cause a program rejection by the
    verifier, e.g. programs with constructs like 'if ([...]) { x = 0; } else
    { x = 1; }' with subsequent 'if (x == 1) { [...] }'. For unprivileged, this
    would result in only single direction always-* taken paths, and unknown taken
    paths being allowed, such that the former could be patched from a conditional
    jump to an unconditional jump (ja). Compared to this approach here, it would
    have two downsides: i) valid programs that otherwise are not performing any
    pointer arithmetic, etc, would potentially be rejected/broken, and ii) we are
    required to turn off path pruning for unprivileged, where both can be avoided
    in this work through pushing the invalid branch to the verification stack.
    
    The issue was originally discovered by Adam and Ofek, and later independently
    discovered and reported as a result of Benedict and Piotr's research work.

    ipv4: Fix device used for dst_alloc with local routes
    
    [ Upstream commit b87b04f5019e821c8c6c7761f258402e43500a1f ]
    
    Oliver reported a use case where deleting a VRF device can hang
    waiting for the refcnt to drop to 0. The root cause is that the dst
    is allocated against the VRF device but cached on the loopback
    device.
    
    The use case (added to the selftests) has an implicit VRF crossing
    due to the ordering of the FIB rules (lookup local is before the
    l3mdev rule, but the problem occurs even if the FIB rules are
    re-ordered with local after l3mdev because the VRF table does not
    have a default route to terminate the lookup). The end result is
    is that the FIB lookup returns the loopback device as the nexthop,
    but the ingress device is in a VRF. The mismatch causes the dst
    alloc against the VRF device but then cached on the loopback.
    
    The fix is to bring the trick used for IPv6 (see ip6_rt_get_dev_rcu):
    pick the dst alloc device based the fib lookup result but with checks
    that the result has a nexthop device (e.g., not an unreachable or
    prohibit entry).

    Outer nest for ETHTOOL_A_STRSET_STRINGSETS is not accounted for.

    and a splat.
    
    As usually with such warnings three conditions must be met for the warning
    to trigger:
     - there must be no skb size rounding up (e.g. reply_size of 684);
     - string set must be per-device (so that the header gets populated);
     - the device name must be at least 12 characters long.
    
    all in all with current user space it looks like reading priv flags
    is the only place this could potentially happen. Or with syzbot :)

    The purpose of the loop using u64_stats_fetch_*_irq() is to ensure

    loop will run again.
    
    Currently the statistics totals are updated inside that window.
    This means that if the loop ever retries, the statistics for the
    CPU will be counted more than once.
    
    Fix this by taking a snapshot of a CPU's statistics inside the
    protected window, and then updating the counters with the snapshot
    values after exiting the loop.

    cxgb4: fix sleep in atomic when flashing PHY firmware
    
    [ Upstream commit f046bd0ae15d8a0bbe57d4647da182420f720c3d ]
    
    Before writing new PHY firmware to on-chip memory, driver queries
    firmware for current running PHY firmware version, which can result
    in sleep waiting for reply. So, move spinlock closer to the actual
    on-chip memory write operation, instead of taking it at the callers.

    [ Upstream commit 72f961320d5d15bfcb26dbe3edaa3f7d25fd2c8a ]
    
    If the host is under sever memory pressure, and RX forward
    memory allocation for the msk fails, we try to borrow the
    required memory from the ingress subflow.
    
    The current attempt is a bit flaky: if skb->truesize is less
    than SK_MEM_QUANTUM, the ssk will not release any memory, and
    the next schedule will fail again.
    
    Instead, directly move the required amount of pages from the
    ssk to the msk, if available

    sch_cake: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options and header
    
    [ Upstream commit ba91c49dedbde758ba0b72f57ac90b06ddf8e548 ]
    
    The TCP option parser in cake qdisc (cake_get_tcpopt and
    cake_tcph_may_drop) could read one byte out of bounds. When the length
    is 1, the execution flow gets into the loop, reads one byte of the
    opcode, and if the opcode is neither TCPOPT_EOL nor TCPOPT_NOP, it reads
    one more byte, which exceeds the length of 1.
    
    This fix is inspired by commit 9609dad263f8 ("ipv4: tcp_input: fix stack
    out of bounds when parsing TCP options.").
    
    v2 changes:
    
    Added doff validation in cake_get_tcphdr to avoid parsing garbage as TCP
    header. Although it wasn't strictly an out-of-bounds access (memory was
    allocated), garbage values could be read where CAKE expected the TCP
    header if doff was smaller than 5.

    net/mlx5e: Remove dependency in IPsec initialization flows
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ad893e516a77209a1818a2072d2027d87db809f ]
    
    Currently, IPsec feature is disabled because mlx5e_build_nic_netdev
    is required to be called after mlx5e_ipsec_init. This requirement is
    invalid as mlx5e_build_nic_netdev and mlx5e_ipsec_init initialize

    rtnetlink: Fix regression in bridge VLAN configuration
    
    [ Upstream commit d2e381c4963663bca6f30c3b996fa4dbafe8fcb5 ]
    
    Cited commit started returning errors when notification info is not
    filled by the bridge driver, resulting in the following regression:
    
     # ip link add name br1 type bridge vlan_filtering 1
     # bridge vlan add dev br1 vid 555 self pvid untagged
     RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
    
    As long as the bridge driver does not fill notification info for the
    bridge device itself, an empty notification should not be considered as
    an error. This is explained in commit 59ccaaaa49b5 ("bridge: dont send
    notification when skb->len == 0 in rtnl_bridge_notify").
    
    Fix by removing the error and add a comment to avoid future bugs.

    udp: fix race between close() and udp_abort()

    Kaustubh reported and diagnosed a panic in udp_lib_lookup().
    The root cause is udp_abort() racing with close(). Both
    racing functions acquire the socket lock, but udp{v6}_destroy_sock()
    release it before performing destructive actions.
    
    We can't easily extend the socket lock scope to avoid the race,
    instead use the SOCK_DEAD flag to prevent udp_abort from doing
    any action when the critical race happens.

    ice: parameterize functions responsible for Tx ring management
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e84f6b3773f43263124c76499c0c4ec3f40aa9b ]
    
    Commit ae15e0ba1b33 ("ice: Change number of XDP Tx queues to match
    number of Rx queues") tried to address the incorrect setting of XDP
    queue count that was based on the Tx queue count, whereas in theory we
    should provide the XDP queue per Rx queue. However, the routines that
    setup and destroy the set of Tx resources are still based on the
    vsi->num_txq.
    
    Ice supports the asynchronous Tx/Rx queue count, so for a setup where
    vsi->num_txq > vsi->num_rxq, ice_vsi_stop_tx_rings and ice_vsi_cfg_txqs
    will be accessing the vsi->xdp_rings out of the bounds.
    
    Parameterize two mentioned functions so they get the size of Tx resources
    array as the input.

    ice: add ndo_bpf callback for safe mode netdev ops
    
    [ Upstream commit ebc5399ea1dfcddac31974091086a3379141899b ]
    
    ice driver requires a programmable pipeline firmware package in order to
    have a support for advanced features. Otherwise, driver falls back to so
    called 'safe mode'. For that mode, ndo_bpf callback is not exposed and
    when user tries to load XDP program, the following happens:
    
    $ sudo ./xdp1 enp179s0f1
    libbpf: Kernel error message: Underlying driver does not support XDP in native mode
    link set xdp fd failed
    
    which is sort of confusing, as there is a native XDP support, but not in
    the current mode. Improve the user experience by providing the specific
    ndo_bpf callback dedicated for safe mode which will make use of extack
    to explicitly let the user know that the DDP package is missing and
    that's the reason that the XDP can't be loaded onto interface currently.

    net: lantiq: disable interrupt before sheduling NAPI
    
    [ Upstream commit f2386cf7c5f4ff5d7b584f5d92014edd7df6c676 ]
    
    This patch fixes TX hangs with threaded NAPI enabled. The scheduled
    NAPI seems to be executed in parallel with the interrupt on second
    thread. Sometimes it happens that ltq_dma_disable_irq() is executed
    after xrx200_tx_housekeeping(). The symptom is that TX interrupts
    are disabled in the DMA controller. As a result, the TX hangs after
    a few seconds of the iperf test. Scheduling NAPI after disabling
    interrupts fixes this issue.
    
    Tested on Lantiq xRX200 (BT Home Hub 5A).

    [ Upstream commit 49bfcbfd989a8f1f23e705759a6bb099de2cff9f ]
    
    Syzbot reported memory leak in rds. The problem
    was in unputted refcount in case of error.
    
    int rds_recvmsg(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg, size_t size,
                    int msg_flags)
    {
    ...
    
            if (!rds_next_incoming(rs, &inc)) {
                    ...
            }
    
    After this "if" inc refcount incremented and
    
            if (rds_cmsg_recv(inc, msg, rs)) {
                    ret = -EFAULT;
                    goto out;
            }
    ...
    out:
            return ret;
    }
    
    in case of rds_cmsg_recv() fail the refcount won't be
    decremented. And it's easy to see from ftrace log, that
    rds_inc_addref() don't have rds_inc_put() pair in
    rds_recvmsg() after rds_cmsg_recv()

    vrf: fix maximum MTU
    
    [ Upstream commit 9bb392f62447d73cc7dd7562413a2cd9104c82f8 ]
    
    My initial goal was to fix the default MTU, which is set to 65536, ie above
    the maximum defined in the driver: 65535 (ETH_MAX_MTU).
    
    In fact, it's seems more consistent, wrt min_mtu, to set the max_mtu to
    IP6_MAX_MTU (65535 + sizeof(struct ipv6hdr)) and use it by default.
    
    Let's also, for consistency, set the mtu in vrf_setup(). This function
    calls ether_setup(), which set the mtu to 1500. Thus, the whole mtu config
    is done in the same function.
    
    Before the patch:
    $ ip link add blue type vrf table 1234
    $ ip link list blue
    9: blue: <NOARP,MASTER> mtu 65536 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether fa:f5:27:70:24:2a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    $ ip link set dev blue mtu 65535
    $ ip link set dev blue mtu 65536
    Error: mtu greater than device maximum.

    libbpf: Fixes incorrect rx_ring_setup_done
    
    [ Upstream commit 11fc79fc9f2e395aa39fa5baccae62767c5d8280 ]
    
    When calling xsk_socket__create_shared(), the logic at line 1097 marks a
    boolean flag true within the xsk_umem structure to track setup progress
    in order to support multiple calls to the function.  However, instead of
    marking umem->tx_ring_setup_done, the code incorrectly sets
    umem->rx_ring_setup_done.  This leads to improper behaviour when
    creating and destroying xsk and umem structures.
    
    Multiple calls to this function is documented as supported.

    mlxsw: core: Set thermal zone polling delay argument to real value at init
    
    [ Upstream commit 2fd8d84ce3095e8a7b5fe96532c91b1b9e07339c ]
    
    Thermal polling delay argument for modules and gearboxes thermal zones
    used to be initialized with zero value, while actual delay was used to
    be set by mlxsw_thermal_set_mode() by thermal operation callback
    set_mode(). After operations set_mode()/get_mode() have been removed by
    cited commits, modules and gearboxes thermal zones always have polling
    time set to zero and do not perform temperature monitoring.
    
    Set non-zero "polling_delay" in thermal_zone_device_register() routine,
    thus, the relevant thermal zones will perform thermal monitoring.

    mlxsw: reg: Spectrum-3: Enforce lowest max-shaper burst size of 11
    
    [ Upstream commit 306b9228c097b4101c150ccd262372ded8348644 ]
    
    A max-shaper is the HW component responsible for delaying egress traffic
    above a configured transmission rate. Burst size is the amount of traffic
    that is allowed to pass without accounting. The burst size value needs to
    be such that it can be expressed as 2^BS * 512 bits, where BS lies in a
    certain ASIC-dependent range. mlxsw enforces that this holds before
    attempting to configure the shaper.
    
    The assumption for Spectrum-3 was that the lower limit of BS would be 5,
    like for Spectrum-1. But as of now, the limit is still 11. Therefore fix
    the driver accordingly, so that incorrect values are rejected early with a
    proper message.

    Ensure that clean up is performed on the allocated file descriptor and
    struct file object in the event that an error is encountered while copying
    fid info objects. Currently, we return directly to the caller when an error

    register may cause undefined behavior and must not be executed."
    Worse, such an access in kvm_lapic_reg_read can result in a leak of
    kernel stack contents. Prior to commit 01402cf81051 ("kvm: LAPIC:
    write down valid APIC registers"), such an access was explicitly

    A crash dump of this problem show that someone called __munlock_pagevec
    to clear page LRU without lock_page: do_mmap -> mmap_region -> do_munmap
    -> munlock_vma_pages_range -> __munlock_pagevec.
    
    As a result memory_failure will call identify_page_state without
    wait_on_page_writeback.  And after truncate_error_page clear the mapping
    of this page.  end_page_writeback won't call sb_clear_inode_writeback to
    clear inode->i_wb_list.  That will trigger BUG_ON in clear_inode!
    
    Fix it by checking PageWriteback too to help determine should we skip
    wait_on_page_writeback.

    dmaengine: xilinx: dpdma: initialize registers before request_irq
    
    [ Upstream commit 538ea65a9fd1194352a41313bff876b74b5d90c5 ]
    
    In some scenarios (kdump), dpdma hardware irqs has been enabled when
    calling request_irq in probe function, and then the dpdma irq handler
    xilinx_dpdma_irq_handler is invoked to access xdev->chan[i]. But at
    this moment xdev->chan[i] hasn't been initialized.
    
    We should ensure the dpdma controller to be in a consistent and
    clean state before further initialization. So add dpdma_hw_init()
    to do this.
    
    Furthermore, in xilinx_dpdma_disable_irq, disable all interrupts
    instead of error interrupts.
    
    This patch is to fix the kdump kernel crash as below:
