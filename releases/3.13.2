    powerpc: Make sure "cache" directory is removed when offlining cpu
    
    commit 91b973f90c1220d71923e7efe1e61f5329806380 upstream.
    
    The code in remove_cache_dir() is supposed to remove the "cache"
    subdirectory from the sysfs directory for a CPU when that CPU is
    being offlined.  It tries to do this by calling kobject_put() on
    the kobject for the subdirectory.  However, the subdirectory only
    gets removed once the last reference goes away, and the reference
    being put here may well not be the last reference.  That means
    that the "cache" subdirectory may still exist when the offlining
    operation has finished.  If the same CPU subsequently gets onlined,
    the code tries to add a new "cache" subdirectory.  If the old
    subdirectory has not yet been removed, we get a WARN_ON in the
    sysfs code, with stack trace, and an error message printed on the
    console.  Further, we ultimately end up with an online cpu with no
    "cache" subdirectory.
    
    This fixes it by doing an explicit kobject_del() at the point where
    we want the subdirectory to go away.  kobject_del() removes the sysfs
    directory even though the object still exists in memory.  The object
    will get freed at some point in the future.  A subsequent onlining
    operation can create a new sysfs directory, even if the old object
    still exists in memory, without causing any problems.

    powerpc: Fix the setup of CPU-to-Node mappings during CPU online
    
    commit d4edc5b6c480a0917e61d93d55531d7efa6230be upstream.
    
    On POWER platforms, the hypervisor can notify the guest kernel about dynamic
    changes in the cpu-numa associativity (VPHN topology update). Hence the
    cpu-to-node mappings that we got from the firmware during boot, may no longer
    be valid after such updates. This is handled using the arch_update_cpu_topology()
    hook in the scheduler, and the sched-domains are rebuilt according to the new
    mappings.
    
    But unfortunately, at the moment, CPU hotplug ignores these updated mappings
    and instead queries the firmware for the cpu-to-numa relationships and uses
    them during CPU online. So the kernel can end up assigning wrong NUMA nodes
    to CPUs during subsequent CPU hotplug online operations (after booting).
    
    Further, a particularly problematic scenario can result from this bug:
    On POWER platforms, the SMT mode can be switched between 1, 2, 4 (and even 8)
    threads per core. The switch to Single-Threaded (ST) mode is performed by
    offlining all except the first CPU thread in each core. Switching back to
    SMT mode involves onlining those other threads back, in each core.
    
    Now consider this scenario:
    
    1. During boot, the kernel gets the cpu-to-node mappings from the firmware
       and assigns the CPUs to NUMA nodes appropriately, during CPU online.
    
    2. Later on, the hypervisor updates the cpu-to-node mappings dynamically and
       communicates this update to the kernel. The kernel in turn updates its
       cpu-to-node associations and rebuilds its sched domains. Everything is
       fine so far.
    
    3. Now, the user switches the machine from SMT to ST mode (say, by running
       ppc64_cpu --smt=1). This involves offlining all except 1 thread in each
       core.
    
    4. The user then tries to switch back from ST to SMT mode (say, by running
       ppc64_cpu --smt=4), and this involves onlining those threads back. Since
       CPU hotplug ignores the new mappings, it queries the firmware and tries to
       associate the newly onlined sibling threads to the old NUMA nodes. This
       results in sibling threads within the same core getting associated with
       different NUMA nodes, which is incorrect.
    
       The scheduler's build-sched-domains code gets thoroughly confused with this
       and enters an infinite loop and causes soft-lockups, as explained in detail
       in commit 3be7db6ab (powerpc: VPHN topology change updates all siblings).
    
    So to fix this, use the numa_cpu_lookup_table to remember the updated
    cpu-to-node mappings, and use them during CPU hotplug online operations.
    Further, we also need to ensure that all threads in a core are assigned to a
    common NUMA node, irrespective of whether all those threads were online during
    the topology update. To achieve this, we take care not to use cpu_sibling_mask()
    since it is not hotplug invariant. Instead, we use cpu_first_sibling_thread()
    and set up the mappings manually using the 'threads_per_core' value for that
    particular platform. This helps us ensure that we don't hit this bug with any
    combination of CPU hotplug and SMT mode switching.

    btrfs: restrict snapshotting to own subvolumes
    
    commit d024206133ce21936b3d5780359afc00247655b7 upstream.
    
    Currently, any user can snapshot any subvolume if the path is accessible and
    thus indirectly create and keep files he does not own under his direcotries.
    This is not possible with traditional directories.
    
    In security context, a user can snapshot root filesystem and pin any
    potentially buggy binaries, even if the updates are applied.
    
    All the snapshots are visible to the administrator, so it's possible to
    verify if there are suspicious snapshots.
    
    Another more practical problem is that any user can pin the space used
    by eg. root and cause ENOSPC.

    Btrfs: setup inode location during btrfs_init_inode_locked
    
    commit 90d3e592e99b8e374ead2b45148abf506493a959 upstream.
    
    We have a race during inode init because the BTRFS_I(inode)->location is setup
    after the inode hash table lock is dropped.  btrfs_find_actor uses the location
    field, so our search might not find an existing inode in the hash table if we
    race with the inode init code.
    
    This commit changes things to setup the location field sooner.  Also the find actor now
    uses only the location objectid to match inodes.  For inode hashing, we just
    need a unique and stable test, it doesn't have to reflect the inode numbers we
    show to userland.

    target/iscsi: Fix network portal creation race
    
    commit ee291e63293146db64668e8d65eb35c97e8324f4 upstream.
    
    When creating network portals rapidly, such as when restoring a
    configuration, LIO's code to reuse existing portals can return a false
    negative if the thread hasn't run yet and set np_thread_state to
    ISCSI_NP_THREAD_ACTIVE. This causes an error in the network stack
    when attempting to bind to the same address/port.
    
    This patch sets NP_THREAD_ACTIVE before the np is placed on g_np_list,
    so even if the thread hasn't run yet, iscsit_get_np will return the
    existing np.
    
    Also, convert np_lock -> np_mutex + hold across adding new net portal
    to g_np_list to prevent a race where two threads may attempt to create
    the same network portal, resulting in one of them failing.

    iscsi-target: Pre-allocate more tags to avoid ack starvation
    
    commit 4a4caa29f1abcb14377e05d57c0793d338fb945d upstream.
    
    This patch addresses an traditional iscsi-target fabric ack starvation
    issue where iscsit_allocate_cmd() -> percpu_ida_alloc_state() ends up
    hitting slow path percpu-ida code, because iscsit_ack_from_expstatsn()
    is expected to free ack'ed tags after tag allocation.
    
    This is done to take into account the tags waiting to be acknowledged
    and released in iscsit_ack_from_expstatsn(), but who's number are not
    directly limited by the CmdSN Window queue_depth being enforced by
    the target.
    
    So that said, this patch bumps up the pre-allocated number of
    per session tags to:
    
      (max(queue_depth, ISCSIT_MIN_TAGS) * 2) + ISCSIT_EXTRA_TAGS
    
    for good measure to avoid the percpu_ida_alloc_state() slow path.

    For quard port chinook (CT2 ASIC based), bfi_image_ct2 is not getting

    hpfs: remember free space
    
    commit 2cbe5c76fc5e38e9af4b709593146e4b8272b69e upstream.
    
    Previously, hpfs scanned all bitmaps each time the user asked for free
    space using statfs.  This patch changes it so that hpfs scans the
    bitmaps only once, remembes the free space and on next invocation of
    statfs it returns the value instantly.
    
    New versions of wine are hammering on the statfs syscall very heavily,
    making some games unplayable when they're stored on hpfs, with load
    times in minutes.
    
    This should be backported to the stable kernels because it fixes
    user-visible problem (excessive level load times in wine).

    parisc/sti_console: prefer Linux fonts over built-in ROM fonts

    The built-in ROM fonts lack many necessary ASCII characters, which is

    supported by the stifb driver (e.g. Visualize FXe) looks much nicer.

    alpha: fix broken network checksum
    
    commit 0ef38d70d4118b2ce1a538d14357be5ff9dc2bbd upstream.
    
    The patch 3ddc5b46a8e90f3c9251338b60191d0a804b0d92 breaks networking on
    alpha (there is a follow-up fix 5cfe8f1ba5eebe6f4b6e5858cdb1a5be4f3272a6,
    but networking is still broken even with the second patch).
    
    The patch 3ddc5b46a8e90f3c9251338b60191d0a804b0d92 makes
    csum_partial_copy_from_user check the pointer with access_ok. However,
    csum_partial_copy_from_user is called also from csum_partial_copy_nocheck
    and csum_partial_copy_nocheck is called on kernel pointers and it is
    supposed not to check pointer validity.
    
    This bug results in ssh session hangs if the system is loaded and bulk
    data are printed to ssh terminal.
    
    This patch fixes csum_partial_copy_nocheck to call set_fs(KERNEL_DS), so
    that access_ok in csum_partial_copy_from_user accepts kernel-space
    addresses.

    mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: fix access hardirq-unsafe lock in atomic context
    
    commit a974862faee199cba3ff36b5a148df5fd34bd1e7 upstream.
    
    Sometimes we may meet the following lockdep issue.
    The root cause is .set_clock callback is executed with spin_lock_irqsave
    in sdhci_do_set_ios. However, the IMX set_clock callback will try to access
    clk_get_rate which is using a mutex lock.
    
    The fix avoids access mutex in .set_clock callback by initializing the
    pltfm_host->clock at probe time and use it later instead of calling
    clk_get_rate again in atomic context.

    mmc: sdhci: fix lockdep error in tuning routine
    
    commit 2b35bd83467df6f8284b9148d6f768148c3a5e5f upstream.
    
    The sdhci_execute_tuning routine gets lock separately by
    disable_irq(host->irq);
    spin_lock(&host->lock);
    It will cause the following lockdep error message since the &host->lock
    could also be got in irq context.
    Use spin_lock_irqsave/spin_unlock_restore instead to get rid of
    this error message.

    mmc: sdhci-pci: add broken HS200 quirk for Intel Merrifield
    
    commit 390145f9adcf2730fcee81c8a51fd7c6c08f705f upstream.
    
    Due to unknown hw issue so far, Merrifield is unable to enable HS200
    support. This patch adds quirk to avoid SDHCI to initialize with error

    net: gre: use icmp_hdr() to get inner ip header
    
    [ Upstream commit c0c0c50ff7c3e331c90bab316d21f724fb9e1994 ]
    
    When dealing with icmp messages, the skb->data points the
    ip header that triggered the sending of the icmp message.
    
    In gre_cisco_err(), the parse_gre_header() is called, and the
    iptunnel_pull_header() is called to pull the skb at the end of
    the parse_gre_header(), so the skb->data doesn't point the
    inner ip header.
    
    Unfortunately, the ipgre_err still needs those ip addresses in
    inner ip header to look up tunnel by ip_tunnel_lookup().
    
    So just use icmp_hdr() to get inner ip header instead of skb->data.

    xen-netfront: fix resource leak in netfront
    
    [ Upstream commit cefe0078eea52af17411eb1248946a94afb84ca5 ]
    
    This patch removes grant transfer releasing code from netfront, and uses
    gnttab_end_foreign_access to end grant access since
    gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref may fail when the grant entry is
    currently used for reading or writing.
    
    * clean up grant transfer code kept from old netfront(2.6.18) which grants
    pages for access/map and transfer. But grant transfer is deprecated in current
    netfront, so remove corresponding release code for transfer.
    
    * fix resource leak, release grant access (through gnttab_end_foreign_access)
    and skb for tx/rx path, use get_page to ensure page is released when grant
    access is completed successfully.
    
    Xen-blkfront/xen-tpmfront/xen-pcifront also have similar issue, but patches
    for them will be created separately.
    
    V6: Correct subject line and commit message.
    
    V5: Remove unecessary change in xennet_end_access.
    
    V4: Revert put_page in gnttab_end_foreign_access, and keep netfront change in
    single patch.
    
    V3: Changes as suggestion from David Vrabel, ensure pages are not freed untill
    grant acess is ended.
    
    V2: Improve patch comments.

    net: Fix memory leak if TPROXY used with TCP early demux
    
    [ Upstream commit a452ce345d63ddf92cd101e4196569f8718ad319 ]
    
    I see a memory leak when using a transparent HTTP proxy using TPROXY
    together with TCP early demux and Kernel v3.8.13.15 (Ubuntu stable):
    
    unreferenced object 0xffff88008cba4a40 (size 1696):

    But there are many more, resulting in the machine going OOM after some
    days.
    
    From looking at the TPROXY code, and with help from Florian, I see
    that the memory leak is introduced in tcp_v4_early_demux():
    
      void tcp_v4_early_demux(struct sk_buff *skb)
      {
        /* ... */
    
        iph = ip_hdr(skb);
        th = tcp_hdr(skb);
    
        if (th->doff < sizeof(struct tcphdr) / 4)
            return;
    
        sk = __inet_lookup_established(dev_net(skb->dev), &tcp_hashinfo,
                           iph->saddr, th->source,
                           iph->daddr, ntohs(th->dest),
                           skb->skb_iif);
        if (sk) {
            skb->sk = sk;
    
    where the socket is assigned unconditionally to skb->sk, also bumping
    the refcnt on it.  This is problematic, because in our case the skb
    has already a socket assigned in the TPROXY target.  This then results
    in the leak I see.
    
    The very same issue seems to be with IPv6, but haven't tested.

    removed a NULL pointer check for in_dev since Linux 3.7.

    commit 6cf70ae928bae17077efc0d528dec49bc380438b upstream.
    
    The first variants of Armada XP SoCs (A0 stepping) have issues related
    to the i2c controller which prevent to use the offload mechanism and
    lead to a kernel hang during boot.
    
    The commit introduces a new the compatible string
    marvell,mv78230-a0-i2c for the i2c controller. When this compatible
    string is used the driver disables the offload mechanism and the
    kernel no more hangs on these SoCs.

    ARM: mvebu: Add quirk for i2c for the OpenBlocks AX3-4 board
    
    commit 85e618a1be2b2092318178d1d66bdad49cbbeeeb upstream.
    
    The first variants of Armada XP SoCs (A0 stepping) have issues related
    to the i2c controller which prevent to use the offload mechanism and
    lead to a kernel hang during boot.
    
    This commit add quirk in the mvebu platform code to check the SoC
    version and then update the compatible string for the i2c controller
    according to the revision of the SoC. Currently only some OpenBlocks
    AX3-4 boards are known to use an A0 revision so the check is done only
    for these boards.

    ARM: mvebu: Add support to get the ID and the revision of a SoC
    
    commit af8d1c63afcbf36eea06789c92e22d4af118d2fb upstream.
    
    All the mvebu SoCs have information related to their variant and
    revision that can be read from the PCI control register.
    
    This patch adds support for Armada XP and Armada 370. This reading of
    the revision and the ID are done before the PCI initialization to
    avoid any conflicts. Once these data are retrieved, the resources are
    freed to let the PCI subsystem use it.

    zram: fix race between reset and flushing pending work
    
    commit da4a04126baa3be03bc566d4a2ee0944c5e783d0 upstream.
    
    Dan and Sergey reported that there is a racy between reset and flushing
    of pending work so that it could make oops by freeing zram->meta in
    reset while zram_slot_free can access zram->meta if new request is
    adding during the race window.
    
    This patch moves flush after taking init_lock so it prevents new request
    so that it closes the race.

    bcache: Data corruption fix
    
    commit ef71ec00002d92a08eb27e9d036e3d48835b6597 upstream.
    
    The code that handles overlapping extents that we've just read back in from disk
    was depending on the behaviour of the code that handles overlapping extents as
    we're inserting into a btree node in the case of an insert that forced an
    existing extent to be split: on insert, if we had to split we'd also insert a
    new extent to represent the top part of the old extent - and then that new
    extent would get written out.
    
    The code that read the extents back in thus not bother with splitting extents -
    if it saw an extent that ovelapped in the middle of an older extent, it would
    trim the old extent to only represent the bottom part, assuming that the
    original insert would've inserted a new extent to represent the top part.
    
    I still haven't figured out _how_ it can happen, but I'm now pretty convinced
    (and testing has confirmed) that there's some kind of an obscure corner case
    (probably involving extent merging, and multiple overwrites in different sets)
    that breaks this. The fix is to change the mergesort fixup code to split extents
    itself when required.

    libata: disable LPM for some WD SATA-I devices
    
    commit ecd75ad514d73efc1bbcc5f10a13566c3ace5f53 upstream.
    
    For some reason, some early WD drives spin up and down drives
    erratically when the link is put into slumber mode which can reduce
    the life expectancy of the device significantly.  Unfortunately, we
    don't have full list of devices and given the nature of the issue it'd
    be better to err on the side of false positives than the other way
    around.  Let's disable LPM on all WD devices which match one of the
    known problematic model prefixes and are SATA-I.
    
    As horkage list doesn't support matching SATA capabilities, this is
    implemented as two horkages - WD_BROKEN_LPM and NOLPM.  The former is
    set for the known prefixes and sets the latter if the matched device
    is SATA-I.
    
    Note that this isn't optimal as this disables all LPM operations and
    partial link power state reportedly works fine on these; however, the
    way LPM is implemented in libata makes it difficult to precisely map
    libata LPM setting to specific link power state.  Well, these devices
    are already fairly outdated.  Let's just disable whole LPM for now.

    On Armada 370/XP SoCs, once a disk is removed from a SATA port, then the
    re-plug events are not detected by the sata_mv driver. This patch fixes
    the issue by updating the PHY speed in the LP_PHY_CTL register (0x58)
    according to the SControl speed.
    
    Note that this fix is only applied if the compatible string
    "marvell,armada-370-sata" is found in the SATA DT node.

    tpm/tpm_i2c_stm_st33: Check return code of get_burstcount
    
    commit 85c5e0d451125c6ddb78663972e40af810b83644 upstream.
    
    The 'get_burstcount' function can in some circumstances 'return -EBUSY' which
    in tpm_stm_i2c_send is stored in an 'u32 burstcnt'
    thus converting the signed value into an unsigned value, resulting
    in 'burstcnt' being huge.
    Changing the type to u32 only does not solve the problem as the signed
    value is converted to an unsigned in I2C_WRITE_DATA, resulting in the
    same effect.
    
    Thus
    -> Change type of burstcnt to u32 (the return type of get_burstcount)
    -> Add a check for the return value of 'get_burstcount' and propagate a
    potential error.
    
    This makes also sense in the 'I2C_READ_DATA' case, where the there is no
    signed/unsigned conversion.

    ALSA: hda/hdmi - allow PIN_OUT to be dynamically enabled
    
    commit 75fae117a5dbde5ab984fa5c60705758cfbc6433 upstream.
    
    Commit 384a48d71520 "ALSA: hda: HDMI: Support codecs with fewer cvts
    than pins" dynamically enabled each pin widget's PIN_OUT only when the
    pin was actively in use. This was required on certain NVIDIA CODECs for
    correct operation. Specifically, if multiple pin widgets each had their
    mux input select the same audio converter widget and each pin widget had
    PIN_OUT enabled, then only one of the pin widgets would actually receive
    the audio, and often not the one the user wanted!
    
    However, this apparently broke some Intel systems, and commit
    6169b673618b "ALSA: hda - Always turn on pins for HDMI/DP" reverted the
    dynamic setting of PIN_OUT. This in turn broke the afore-mentioned NVIDIA
    CODECs.
    
    This change supports either dynamic or static handling of PIN_OUT,
    selected by a flag set up during CODEC initialization. This flag is
    enabled for all recent NVIDIA GPUs.

    ALSA: hda - Fix silent output on MacBook Air 1,1
    
    commit e7729a415315fcd9516912050d85d5aaebcededc upstream.
    
    Similarly to other Apple products, MBA 1,1 needs a specific quirk.
    Pin 0x18 must be set to VREF_50 to have sound output.  This was no
    longer done since commit 1a97b7f, resulting in a mute built-in speaker.
    
    This patch corrects the regression by creating a fixup for the MBA 1,1.

    ALSA: hda - add headset mic detect quirks for some Dell machines
    
    commit c48ae0ab3790efba2dfb1a4709c0ef8da024de1a upstream.
    
    When we plug a 3-ring headset on some Dell machines, the headset
    mic can't be detected, after apply this patch, the headset mic
    can work well on all those machines.
    
    On the machine with the Subsytem ID 0x10280610, if we use
    ALC269_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE, the headset mic can be
    detected and work well, but the sound can't be outputed via
    headphone anymore, use ALC269_FIXUP_DELL3_MIC_NO_PRESENCE
    can fix this problem.

    ALSA: hda - automute via amp instead of pinctl on some AIO models
    
    commit 493a52a9b6645f61954580c7d4bd52fa62110934 upstream.
    
    On some AIO (All In One) models with the codec alc668
    (Vendor ID: 0x10ec0668) on it, when we plug a headphone into the jack,
    the system will switch the output to headphone and set the speaker to
    automute as well as change the speaker Pin-ctls from 0x40 to 0x00,
    this will bring loud noise to the headphone.
    
    I tried to disable the corresponding EAPD, but it did not help to
    eliminate the noise.
    
    According to Takashi's suggestion, we use amp operation to replace the
    pinctl modification for the automute, this really eliminate the noise.

    ALSA: Enable CONFIG_ZONE_DMA for smaller PCI DMA masks
    
    commit 80ab8eae70e51d578ebbeb228e0f7a562471b8b7 upstream.
    
    The PCI devices with DMA masks smaller than 32bit should enable
    CONFIG_ZONE_DMA.  Since the recent change of page allocator, page
    allocations via dma_alloc_coherent() with the limited DMA mask bits
    may fail more frequently, ended up with no available buffers, when
    CONFIG_ZONE_DMA isn't enabled.  With CONFIG_ZONE_DMA, the system has
    much more chance to obtain such pages.

    ALSA: hda - Don't create duplicated ctls for loopback paths
    
    commit 43a8e50a46a4e1dd1451e4a4ffa1f7695fb7d287 upstream.
    
    AD1986A mic pins (0x1d and 0x1f) share the same widget for controlling
    the loopback volume/mute, but the generic parser didn't check it.
    This ended up with the duplicated controls for the same effect.
    
    This patch adds the check of the duplication for avoiding it.
    
    After this fix, there will be only one control although it affects
    both paths; this remaining issue should be fixed later in a different
    patch.

    perf kvm: Fix kvm report without guestmount.
    
    commit ad85ace07a05062ef6b59c35a5e80b6eaee1eee6 upstream.
    
    Currently, if we use perf kvm --guestkallsyms --guestmodules report, we
    can not get the perf information from perf data file. All sample are
    shown as unknown.
    
    Reproducing steps:
            # perf kvm --guestkallsyms /tmp/kallsyms --guestmodules /tmp/modules record -a sleep 1
            [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
            [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.624 MB perf.data.guest (~27260 samples) ]
            # perf kvm --guestkallsyms /tmp/kallsyms --guestmodules /tmp/modules report |grep %
               100.00%  [guest/6471]  [unknown]         [g] 0xffffffff8164f330
    
    This bug was introduced by 207b57926 (perf kvm: Fix regression with guest machine creation).
    In original code, it uses perf_session__find_machine(), it means we deliver symbol to machine
    which has the same pid, if no machine found, deliver it to *default* guest. But if we use
    perf_session__findnew_machine() here, if no machine was found, new machine with pid will be built
    and added. Then the default guest which with pid == 0 will never get a symbol.
    
    And because the new machine initialized here has no kernel map created, the symbol delivered to
    it will be marked as "unknown".
    
    This patch here is to revert commit 207b57926 and fix the SEGFAULT bug in another way.
    
    Verification steps:
            # ./perf kvm --guestkallsyms /home/kallsyms --guestmodules /home/modules record -a sleep 1
            [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
            [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.651 MB perf.data.guest (~28437 samples) ]

    commit df5e4e8b576108f88f79e5b4c984d51d460d2360 upstream.
    
    The interrupt handler (mic_interrupt), called in the MSI/INTx mode,
    writes to the interrupt sources register to acknowledge the
    interrupt and then calls the corresponding callback handlers to handle
    the same. These callback handlers acknowledge the interrupts again
    leading to missed interrupts. This patch fixes the issue by removing
    the interrupt acknowlegment code from the callback handlers.

    rtc: max8907: weekday encoding fixes
    
    commit 75ea799df4cb07e505c91b4abaa87bc28aad3e66 upstream.
    
    The current MAX8907 driver has two issues related to weekday value
    handling:
    
    1)
    
    The HW WEEKDAY register has range 0..6 rather than 1..7 as documented.
    Note that I validated the actual HW range by observing the HW register
    roll from 6->0 rather than 6->7->1 as would otherwise be expected.
    
    This matches Linux's tm_wday range of 0..6.
    
    When the CMOS RAM content is lost, the date returned from the device is
    2007-01-01 00:00:00, which is a Monday.  The WEEKDAY register reads 1 in
    this case.  This matches the numbering in Linux's tm_wday field.
    
    Hence we should write Linux's tm_wday value to the register without
    modifying it.  Hence, remove the +1/-1 calculations for WEEKDAY/tm_wday.
    
    2)
    
    There's no need to make alarms match on the WEEKDAY register, since the
    other fields together uniquely define the alarm date/time.  Ignoring the
    WEEKDAY value in the match isolates the driver from any incorrect value in
    the current time copy of the WEEKDAY register.
    
    Each change individually, or both together, solves an issue that I
    observed; "hwclock -r" would time out waiting for its alarm to fire if the
    CMOS RAM content had been lost, and hence the WEEKDAY register value
    mismatched what the driver expected it to be.  "hwclock -w" would solve
    this by over-writing the HW default WEEKDAY register value with what the
    driver expected.

    parport: parport_pc: remove double PCI ID for NetMos
    
    commit d6a484520c5572a4170fa915109ccfc0c38f5008 upstream.
    
    In commit 85747f ("PATCH] parport: add NetMOS 9805 support") Max added
    the PCI ID for NetMOS 9805 based on a Debian bug report from 2k4 which
    was at the v2.4.26 time frame. The patch made into 2.6.14.
    Shortly before that patch akpm merged commit 296d3c783b ("[PATCH] Support
    NetMOS based PCI cards providing serial and parallel ports") which made
    into v2.6.9-rc1.
    Now we have two different entries for the same PCI id.
    I have here the NetMos 9805 which claims to support SPP/EPP/ECP mode.
    This patch takes Max's entry for titan_1284p1 (base != -1 specifies the
    ioport for ECP mode) and replaces akpm's entry for netmos_9805 which
    specified -1 (=none). Both share the same PCI-ID (my card has subsystem
    0x1000 / 0x0020 so it should match PCI_ANY).

    s390/uapi: fix struct statfs64 definition
    
    commit 4e078146dff728f4865270a47710d57797e81eb6 upstream.
    
    With b8668fd0a7e1b59f "s390/uapi: change struct statfs[64] member types
    to unsigned values" the size of a couple of struct statfs64 member got
    incorrectly changed from 64 to 32 bit for 32 bit builds.
    
    Fix this by changing the type of couple of struct statfs64 members from
    unsigned long to unsigned long long.
    The definition of struct compat_statfs64 was correct however.

    KVM: s390: ioeventfd: ignore leftmost bits
    
    commit ff1f3cb4b3ac5d039f02679f34cb1498d110d241 upstream.
    
    The diagnose 500 subcode 3 contains the 32 bit subchannel id in bits 32-63
    (counting from the left). As for other I/O instructions, bits 0-31 should be
    ignored and thus not be passed to kvm_io_bus_write_cookie().
    
    This fixes a bug where the guest passed non-zero bits 0-31 which the
    host tried to interpret, leading to ioeventfd notification failures.

    The SIGP order STOP_AND_STORE_STATUS is defined to stop a CPU and store
    its status. However, we only stored the status if the CPU was still
    running, so make sure that the status is now also stored if the CPU was
    already stopped. This fixes the problem that the CPU information was
    not stored correctly in kdump files, rendering them unreadable.

    serial: 8250: enable UART_BUG_NOMSR for Tegra
    
    commit 3685f19e07802ec4207b52465c408f185b66490e upstream.
    
    Tegra chips have 4 or 5 identical UART modules embedded. UARTs C..E have
    their MODEM-control signals tied off to a static state. However UARTs A
    and B can optionally route those signals to/from package pins, depending
    on the exact pinmux configuration.
    
    When these signals are not routed to package pins, false interrupts may
    trigger either temporarily, or permanently, all while not showing up in
    the IIR; it will read as NO_INT. This will eventually lead to the UART
    IRQ being disabled due to unhandled interrupts. When this happens, the
    kernel may print e.g.:
    
        irq 68: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)
    
    In order to prevent this, enable UART_BUG_NOMSR. This prevents
    UART_IER_MSI from being enabled, which prevents the false interrupts
    from triggering.
    
    In practice, this is not needed under any of the following conditions:
    
    * On Tegra chips after Tegra30, since the HW bug has apparently been
      fixed.
    
    * On UARTs C..E since their MODEM control signals are tied to the correct
      static state which doesn't trigger the issue.
    
    * On UARTs A..B if the MODEM control signals are routed out to package
      pins, since they will then carry valid signals.
    
    However, we ignore these exceptions for now, since they are only relevant
    if a board actually hooks up more than a 4-wire UART, and no currently
    supported board does this. If we ever support a board that does, we can
    refine the algorithm that enables UART_BUG_NOMSR to take those exceptions
    into account, and/or read a flag from DT/... that indicates that the
    board has hooked up and pinmux'd more than a 4-wire UART.

    uio: fix devm_request_irq usage
    
    commit 632fefaf1fff7c344191c363e08a43cf006fe60e upstream.
    
    Commit e6789cd3dfb553077606ccafeb05e0043f072481 (uio: Simplify uio error
    path by using devres functions) converted uio to use devm_request_irq().
    This introduced a change in behaviour since the IRQ is associated with
    the parent device instead of the created UIO device. The IRQ will remain
    active after uio_unregister_device() is called, and some drivers will
    crash because of this. The patch fixes this.

    xhci: Set scatter-gather limit to avoid failed block writes.
    
    commit f2d9b991c549f159dc9ae81f77d8206c790cbfee upstream.
    
    Commit 35773dac5f862cb1c82ea151eba3e2f6de51ec3e "usb: xhci: Link TRB
    must not occur within a USB payload burst" attempted to fix an issue
    found with USB ethernet adapters, and inadvertently broke USB storage
    devices.  The patch attempts to ensure that transfers never span a
    segment, and rejects transfers that have more than 63 entries (or
    possibly less, if some entries cross 64KB boundaries).
    
    usb-storage limits the maximum transfer size to 120K, and we had assumed
    the block layer would pass a scatter-gather list of 4K entries,
    resulting in no more than 31 sglist entries:
    
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=138498190419312&w=2
    
    That assumption was wrong, since we've seen the driver reject a write
    that was 218 sectors long (of probably 512 bytes each):
    
    Jan  1 07:04:49 jidanni5 kernel: [  559.624704] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: Too many fragments 79, max 63

    Limit the number of scatter-gather entries to half a ring segment.  That
    should be margin enough in case some entries cross 64KB boundaries.
    Increase the number of TRBs per segment from 64 to 256, which should
    result in ring segments fitting on a 4K page.

    xhci: Avoid infinite loop when sg urb requires too many trbs
    
    commit d6c9ea9069af684358efedcaf2f2f687f51c58ee upstream.
    
    Currently prepare_ring() returns -ENOMEM if the urb won't fit into a
    single ring segment.  usb_sg_wait() treats this error as a temporary
    condition and will keep retrying until something else goes wrong.
    
    The number of retries should be limited in usb_sg_wait(), but also
    prepare_ring() should not return an error code that suggests it might
    be worth retrying.  Change it to -EINVAL.

    tty/serial: at91: disable uart timer at start of shutdown
    
    commit 8bc661bfc0c2d221e209f4205bdaaf574d50100c upstream.
    
    The uart timer will schedule a tasklet when it fires. It is possible that it
    can fire inside _shutdown before it is killed in the dma and pdc cleanup
    routines. This causes a tasklet that exists after the port is shutdown, so when
    the kernel finally executes it, it panics as the tty port is NULL.
    
    This is a somewhat rare condition but its possible if a program keeps on
    opening/closing the port. It has been observed in particular with systemd
    boot messages that were causing a kernel panic because of this behavior.
    
    Moving the timer deletion to the beginning of the function stops a tasklet from
    being scheduled unexpectedly.

    tty/serial: at91: reset rx_ring when port is shutdown
    
    commit bb7e73c598fb226c75f7625088a8f6a45a0fc892 upstream.
    
    When using RX DMA, the driver won't pass any data to the uart layer
    until the buffer is flipped. When the port is shutdown, the dma buffers
    are unmapped, but the head and tail of the ring buffer are not reseted.
    Since the serial console will keep the port open, this will only
    present itself when the uart is not shared.
    
    To reproduce the issue, with an unpatched driver, run a getty on /dev/ttyS0
    with no serial console and exit. Getty will exit, and when the new one returns
    you will be unable to log in.  If you hold down a key long enough to fill the
    DMA buffer and flip it, you can then log in.

    However it was called after uart_remove_one_port which destroys tty references

    staging/lustre/ptlrpc: Fix a crash when dereferencing NULL pointer
    
    commit 3c92a0bf4d72737035a16c4fe357ccd439c9b7d2 upstream.
    
    When a system runs out of memory and the function
    ptlrpc_register_bulk() is called from ptl_send_rpc() the call to
    LNetMEAttach() fails due to failure to allocate memory.  This forces
    the code into an error path, which most probably previously went
    untested.  The error path:
    if (rc != 0) {
            CERROR("%s: LNetMEAttach failed x"LPU64"/%d: rc = %dn",
                    desc->bd_export->exp_obd->obd_name, xid,
                    posted_md, rc);
            break;
    }
    This print assumes that desc->bd_export is not NULL.  However, it is.
    In fact it is expected to be NULL.  desc->bd_import is the correct
    structure to access in this case.

    Fast Channel Change across bands was enabled for
    AR9462 recently, but this is causing baseband issues.
    Disable it until this feature is tested well. Also,
    remove the feature bit for AR9565 since it is

    ath9k: Use correct channel for RX packets
    
    commit ff9a93f2ebb88ac7aab9568de80b64b92078e96d upstream.
    
    Accessing the current channel definition in mac80211
    when processing RX packets is problematic because it
    could have been updated when a scan is issued. Since a
    channel change involves flushing the existing packets
    in the RX queue before a chip-reset is done, they would
    be processed using the wrong band/channel information.
    
    To avoid this, use the current channel information
    maintained in the driver.

    b43: Fix lockdep splat
    
    commit 09164043f63c947a49797750a09ca1cd7c31108e upstream.
    
    In https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67561, a locking dependency is reported
    when b43 is used with hostapd, and rfkill is used to kill the radio output.
    
    The lockdep splat (in part) is as follows:
    
    ======================================================
    [ INFO: possible circular locking dependency detected ]
    3.12.0 #1 Not tainted
    -------------------------------------------------------
    rfkill/10040 is trying to acquire lock:
     (rtnl_mutex){+.+.+.}, at: [<ffffffff8146f282>] rtnl_lock+0x12/0x20
    
    but task is already holding lock:
     (rfkill_global_mutex){+.+.+.}, at: [<ffffffffa04832ca>] rfkill_fop_write+0x6a/0x170 [rfkill]
    
    --snip--
    
    Chain exists of:
      rtnl_mutex --> misc_mtx --> rfkill_global_mutex
    
    The fix is to move the initialization of the hardware random number generator
    outside the code range covered by the rtnl_mutex.

    iwlwifi: pcie: enable oscillator for L1 exit
    
    commit 2d93aee152b1758a94a18fe15d72153ba73b5679 upstream.
    
    Enabling the oscillator consumes slightly more power (100uA)
    but allows to make sure that we exit from L1 on time.
    
    Not doing so might lead to a PCIe specification violation
    since we might wake up from L1 at the wrong time.
    This issue has been identified on 3160 and 7260 only.
    On older NICs L1 off is not enabled, on newer NICs (7265),
    the issue is fixed.
    
    When the bug occurs the user sees that the NIC has
    disappeared from the PCI bridge, any access to the device
    returns 0xff.
    
    This fixes:
            https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64541
    
    and has been extensively discussed here:

    The initial USB driver did not use some register save locations in the
    private data storage. To save some memory, a union was used to overlay these
    variables with USB I/O components. In an update of the gain-control code,
    these register save locations are now needed for USB drivers.

    usb: ehci: add freescale imx28 special write register method
    
    commit feffe09f510c475df082546815f9e4a573f6a233 upstream.
    
    According to Freescale imx28 Errata, "ENGR119653 USB: ARM to USB
    register error issue", All USB register write operations must
    use the ARM SWP instruction. So, we implement a special ehci_write
    for imx28.
    
    Discussion for it at below:
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=137996395529294&w=2
    
    Without this patcheset, imx28 works unstable at high AHB bus loading.
    If the bus loading is not high, the imx28 usb can work well at the most
    of time. There is a IC errata for this problem, usually, we consider
    IC errata is a problem not a new feature, and this workaround is needed
    for that, so we need to add them to stable tree 3.11+.

    USB: fix race between hub_disconnect and recursively_mark_NOTATTACHED
    
    commit 543d7784b07ffd16cc82a9cb4e1e0323fd0040f1 upstream.
    
    There is a race in the hub driver between hub_disconnect() and
    recursively_mark_NOTATTACHED().  This race can be triggered if the
    driver is unbound from a device at the same time as the bus's root hub
    is removed.  When the race occurs, it can cause an oops:
    
    BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000015c

    One problem is that recursively_mark_NOTATTACHED() uses the intfdata
    value and hub->hdev->maxchild while hub_disconnect() is clearing them.
    Another problem is that it uses hub->ports[i] while the port device is
    being released.
    
    To fix this race, we need to hold the device_state_lock while
    hub_disconnect() changes the values.  (Note that usb_disconnect()
    and hub_port_connect_change() already acquire this lock at similar
    critical times during a USB device's life cycle.)  We also need to
    remove the port devices after maxchild has been set to 0, instead of
    before.

    USB: Nokia 502 is an unusual device
    
    commit 0e16114f2db4838251fb64f3b550996ad3585890 upstream.
    
    The USB storage operation of Nokia Asha 502 Dual SIM smartphone running Asha
    Platform 1.1.1 is unreliable in respect of data consistency (i.e. transfered
    files are corrupted). A similar issue is described here:
    http://discussions.nokia.com/t5/Asha-and-other-Nokia-Series-30/Nokia-301-USB-transfers-and-corrupted-files/td-p/1974170
    
    The workaround is (MAX_SECTORS_64):
       rmmod usb_storage && modprobe usb_storage quirks=0421:06aa:m
    
    The patch adds the tested device to the unusual list permanently.

    USB: ftdi_sio: added CS5 quirk for broken smartcard readers
    
    commit c1f15196ac3b541d084dc80a8fbd8a74c6a0bd44 upstream.
    
    Genuine FTDI chips support only CS7/8. A previous fix in commit
    8704211f65a2 ("USB: ftdi_sio: fixed handling of unsupported CSIZE
    setting") enforced this limitation and reported it back to userspace.
    
    However, certain types of smartcard readers depend on specific
    driver behaviour that requests 0 data bits (not 5) to change into a
    different operating mode if CS5 has been set.
    
    This patch reenables this behaviour for all FTDI devices.
    
    Tagged to be added to stable, because it affects a lot of users of
    embedded systems which rely on these readers to work properly.

    USB: pl2303: fix data corruption on termios updates
    
    commit 623c8263376c0b8a4b0c220232e7313d762cd0cc upstream.
    
    Some PL2303 devices are known to lose bytes if you change serial
    settings even to the same values as before. Avoid this by comparing the
    encoded settings with the previsouly used ones before configuring the
    device.
    
    The common case was fixed by commit bf5e5834bffc6 ("pl2303: Fix mode
    switching regression"), but this problem was still possible to trigger,
    for instance, by using the TCSETS2-interface to repeatedly request
    115201 baud, which gets mapped to 115200 and thus always triggers a
    settings update.

    usb: cdc-wdm: resp_count can be 0 even if WDM_READ is set
    
    commit f563926fed982f26b391ca42493f55f2447f1b0a upstream.
    
    Do not decrement resp_count if it's already 0.
    
    We set resp_count to 0 when the device is closed.  The next open and
    read will try to clear the WDM_READ flag if there was leftover data
    in the read buffer. This fix is necessary to prevent resubmitting
    the read URB in a tight loop because resp_count becomes negative.
    
    The bug can easily be triggered from userspace by not reading all
    data in the read buffer, and then closing and reopening the chardev.

    usb: cdc-wdm: avoid hanging on zero length reads
    
    commit 8dd5cd5395b90070d98149d0a94e5981a74cd2ec upstream.
    
    commit 73e06865ead1 ("USB: cdc-wdm: support back-to-back
    USB_CDC_NOTIFY_RESPONSE_AVAILABLE notifications") implemented
    queued response handling. This added a new requirement: The read
    urb must be resubmitted every time we clear the WDM_READ flag if
    the response counter indicates that the device is waiting for a
    read.
    
    Fix by factoring out the code handling the WMD_READ clearing and
    possible urb submission, calling it everywhere we clear the flag.
    
    Without this fix, the driver ends up in a state where the read urb
    is inactive, but the response counter is positive after a zero
    length read.  This prevents the read urb from ever being submitted
    again and the driver appears to be hanging.

    usb: chipidea: udc: using MultO at TD as real mult value for ISO-TX
    
    commit 2fc5a7dace3c43e62402ab4e8800a8f1834ffe2a upstream.
    
    We have met a bug that the high bandwidth ISO-TX transfer has failed
    at the last packet if it is less than 1024, the TD status shows it
    is "Transaction Error".
    
    The root cause of this problem is: the mult value at qh is not correct
    for current TD's transfer length. We use TD list to queue un-transfer
    TDs, and change mult for new adding TDs. If new adding TDs transfer length
    less than 1024, but the queued un-transfer TDs transfer length is larger
    than 1024, the transfer error will occur, and vice versa.
    Usually, this problem occurs at the last packet, and the first packet for
    new frame.
    
    We fixed this problem by setting Mult at QH as the largest value (3), and
    set MultO (Multiplier Override) at TD according to every transfer length.
    It can cover both hardware version less than 2.3 (the real mult is MultO
    if it is not 0) and 2.3+ (the real mult is min(qh.mult, td.multo)).
    
    Since the MultO bits are only existed at TX TD, we keep the ISO-RX behavior
    unchanged.
    
    For stable tree: 3.11+.

    usb: chipidea: need to mask INT_STATUS when write otgsc
    
    commit 5332ff1fb63c46588656e4208201bc131627c878 upstream.
    
    For otgsc, both enable bits and status bits are in it. So we need
    to make sure the status bits are not be cleared when write enable
    bits. It can fix one bug that we plug in/out Micro AB cable fast,
    and sometimes, the IDIS will be cleared wrongly when handle last
    ID interrupt (ID 0->1), so the current interrupt will not occur.

    usb: chipidea: add freescale imx28 special write register method
    
    commit ed8f8318d2ef3e5f9e4ddf79349508c116b68d7f upstream.
    
    According to Freescale imx28 Errata, "ENGR119653 USB: ARM to USB
    register error issue", All USB register write operations must
    use the ARM SWP instruction. So, we implement special hw_write
    and hw_test_and_clear for imx28.

    x86, kvm: correctly access the KVM_CPUID_FEATURES leaf at 0x40000101
    
    commit 77f01bdfa5e55dc19d3eb747181d2730a9bb3ca8 upstream.
    
    When Hyper-V hypervisor leaves are present, KVM must relocate
    its own leaves at 0x40000100, because Windows does not look for
    Hyper-V leaves at indices other than 0x40000000.  In this case,
    the KVM features are at 0x40000101, but the old code would always
    look at 0x40000001.
    
    Fix by using kvm_cpuid_base().  This also requires making the
    function non-inline, since kvm_cpuid_base() is static.

    commit 1c300a40772dae829b91dad634999a6a522c0829 upstream.
    
    It is unnecessary to go through hypervisor_cpuid_base every time
    a leaf is found (which will be every time a feature is requested
    after the next patch).

    x86, x32: Correct invalid use of user timespec in the kernel
    
    commit 2def2ef2ae5f3990aabdbe8a755911902707d268 upstream.
    
    The x32 case for the recvmsg() timout handling is broken:
    
      asmlinkage long compat_sys_recvmmsg(int fd, struct compat_mmsghdr __user *mmsg,
                                          unsigned int vlen, unsigned int flags,
                                          struct compat_timespec __user *timeout)
      {
              int datagrams;
              struct timespec ktspec;
    
              if (flags & MSG_CMSG_COMPAT)
                      return -EINVAL;
    
              if (COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME)
                      return __sys_recvmmsg(fd, (struct mmsghdr __user *)mmsg, vlen,
                                            flags | MSG_CMSG_COMPAT,
                                            (struct timespec *) timeout);
              ...
    
    The timeout pointer parameter is provided by userland (hence the __user
    annotation) but for x32 syscalls it's simply cast to a kernel pointer
    and is passed to __sys_recvmmsg which will eventually directly
    dereference it for both reading and writing.  Other callers to
    __sys_recvmmsg properly copy from userland to the kernel first.
    
    The bug was introduced by commit ee4fa23c4bfc ("compat: Use
    COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME in net/compat.c") and should affect all kernels
    since 3.4 (and perhaps vendor kernels if they backported x32 support
    along with this code).
    
    Note that CONFIG_X86_X32_ABI gets enabled at build time and only if
    CONFIG_X86_X32 is enabled and ld can build x32 executables.
    
    Other uses of COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME seem fine.
    
    This addresses CVE-2014-0038.

    mm/mempolicy.c: fix mempolicy printing in numa_maps
    
    commit 8790c71a18e5d2d93532ae250bcf5eddbba729cd upstream.
    
    As a result of commit 5606e3877ad8 ("mm: numa: Migrate on reference
    policy"), /proc/<pid>/numa_maps prints the mempolicy for any <pid> as
    "prefer:N" for the local node, N, of the process reading the file.
    
    This should only be printed when the mempolicy of <pid> is
    MPOL_PREFERRED for node N.
    
    If the process is actually only using the default mempolicy for local
    node allocation, make sure "default" is printed as expected.

    commit 90ed4988b8c030d65b41b7d13140e9376dc6ec5a upstream.
    
    In case the device 0, function 1 is not found using pci_get_device(),
    pci_scan_single_device() will be used but, differently than
    pci_get_device(), it allocates a pci_dev but doesn't does bump the usage
    count on the pci_dev and after few module removals and loads the pci_dev
    will be freed.
