    x86 EDAC, sb_edac.c: Repair damage introduced when "fixing" channel address
    
    [ Upstream commit ff15e95c82768d589957dbb17d7eb7dba7904659 ]
    
    In commit:
    
      eb1af3b71f9d ("Fix computation of channel address")
    
    I switched the "sck_way" variable from holding the log2 value read
    from the h/w to instead be the actual number. Unfortunately it
    is needed in log2 form when used to shift the address.

    x86/mm/xen: Suppress hugetlbfs in PV guests
    
    [ Upstream commit 103f6112f253017d7062cd74d17f4a514ed4485c ]
    
    Huge pages are not normally available to PV guests. Not suppressing
    hugetlbfs use results in an endless loop of page faults when user mode
    code tries to access a hugetlbfs mapped area (since the hypervisor
    denies such PTEs to be created, but error indications can't be
    propagated out of xen_set_pte_at(), just like for various of its
    siblings), and - once killed in an oops like this:

    s390/hugetlb: add hugepages_supported define
    
    [ Upstream commit 7f9be77555bb2e52de84e9dddf7b4eb20cc6e171 ]
    
    On s390 we only can enable hugepages if the underlying hardware/hypervisor
    also does support this.  Common code now would assume this to be
    signaled by setting HPAGE_SHIFT to 0.  But on s390, where we only
    support one hugepage size, there is a link between HPAGE_SHIFT and
    pageblock_order.
    
    So instead of setting HPAGE_SHIFT to 0, we will implement the check for
    the hardware capability.

    [ Upstream commit 2531c8cf56a640cd7d17057df8484e570716a450 ]
    
    s390 has a constant hugepage size, by setting HPAGE_SHIFT we also change
    e.g. the pageblock_order, which should be independent in respect to
    hugepage support.
    
    With this patch every architecture is free to define how to check
    for hugepage support.

    drm/radeon: forbid mapping of userptr bo through radeon device file
    
    [ Upstream commit b5dcec693f87cb8475f2291c0075b2422addd3d6 ]
    
    Allowing userptr bo which are basicly a list of page from some vma
    (so either anonymous page or file backed page) would lead to serious
    corruption of kernel structures and counters (because we overwrite
    the page->mapping field when mapping buffer).
    
    This will already block if the buffer was populated before anyone does
    try to mmap it because then TTM_PAGE_FLAG_SG would be set in in the
    ttm_tt flags. But that flag is check before ttm_tt_populate in the ttm
    vm fault handler.
    
    So to be safe just add a check to verify_access() callback.

    drm/dp/mst: Validate port in drm_dp_payload_send_msg()
    
    [ Upstream commit deba0a2af9592b2022a0bce7b085a318b53ce1db ]
    
    With the joys of things running concurrently, there's always a chance
    that the port we get passed in drm_dp_payload_send_msg() isn't actually
    valid anymore. Because of this, we need to make sure we validate the
    reference to the port before we use it otherwise we risk running into
    various race conditions. For instance, on the Dell MST monitor I have
    here for testing, hotplugging it enough times causes us to kernel panic:

    futex: Handle unlock_pi race gracefully
    
    [ Upstream commit 89e9e66ba1b3bde9d8ea90566c2aee20697ad681 ]
    
    If userspace calls UNLOCK_PI unconditionally without trying the TID -> 0
    transition in user space first then the user space value might not have the
    waiters bit set. This opens the following race:
    
    CPU0                        CPU1
    uval = get_user(futex)
                                lock(hb)
    lock(hb)
                                futex |= FUTEX_WAITERS
                                ....
                                unlock(hb)
    
    cmpxchg(futex, uval, newval)
    
    So the cmpxchg fails and returns -EINVAL to user space, which is wrong because
    the futex value is valid.
    
    To handle this (yes, yet another) corner case gracefully, check for a flag
    change and retry.

    Revert "drm/radeon: disable runtime pm on PX laptops without dGPU power control"
    
    [ Upstream commit bfaddd9fc8ac048b99475f000dbef6f08297417f ]
    
    This reverts commit e64c952efb8e0c15ae82cec8e455ab4910690ef1.
    
    ATPX is the ACPI method for controlling AMD PowerXpress laptops.
    There are flags to indicate which methods are supported.  If
    the dGPU power down flag is not supported, the driver needs to
    implement the dGPU power down manually.  We had previously
    always forced the driver to assume the ATPX dGPU power down
    was present, but this causes problems on boards where it is
    not, leading to GPU hangs when attempting to power down the
    dGPU.  Manual dGPU power down is not currently supported in
    the Linux driver.  Some laptops indicate that the ATPX
    dGPU power down method is not present, but it actually
    apparently is.  I'm not sure if this is a bios bug and it should
    be set or if there is a reason it was unset and the method should
    not be used.  This is not an issue on other OSes since both the
    ATPX and the manual driver power down methods are supported.
    
    This is apparently fairly widespread, so just revert for now.

    powerpc: scan_features() updates incorrect bits for REAL_LE
    
    [ Upstream commit 6997e57d693b07289694239e52a10d2f02c3a46f ]
    
    The REAL_LE feature entry in the ibm_pa_feature struct is missing an MMU
    feature value, meaning all the remaining elements initialise the wrong
    values.
    
    This means instead of checking for byte 5, bit 0, we check for byte 0,
    bit 0, and then we incorrectly set the CPU feature bit as well as MMU
    feature bit 1 and CPU user feature bits 0 and 2 (5).
    
    Checking byte 0 bit 0 (IBM numbering), means we're looking at the
    "Memory Management Unit (MMU)" feature - ie. does the CPU have an MMU.
    In practice that bit is set on all platforms which have the property.
    
    This means we set CPU_FTR_REAL_LE always. In practice that seems not to
    matter because all the modern cpus which have this property also
    implement REAL_LE, and we've never needed to disable it.
    
    We're also incorrectly setting MMU feature bit 1, which is:
    
      #define MMU_FTR_TYPE_8xx              0x00000002
    
    Luckily the only place that looks for MMU_FTR_TYPE_8xx is in Book3E
    code, which can't run on the same cpus as scan_features(). So this also
    doesn't matter in practice.
    
    Finally in the CPU user feature mask, we're setting bits 0 and 2. Bit 2
    is not currently used, and bit 0 is:
    
      #define PPC_FEATURE_PPC_LE            0x00000001
    
    Which says the CPU supports the old style "PPC Little Endian" mode.
    Again this should be harmless in practice as no 64-bit CPUs implement
    that mode.
    
    Fix the code by adding the missing initialisation of the MMU feature.
    
    Also add a comment marking CPU user feature bit 2 (0x4) as reserved. It
    would be unsafe to start using it as old kernels incorrectly set it.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Add ALC3234 headset mode for Optiplex 9020m
    
    [ Upstream commit afecb146d8d8a60a1dde9cdf570c278649617fde ]
    
    The Optiplex 9020m with Haswell-DT processor needs a quirk for the
    headset jack at the front of the machine to be able to use microphones.
    
    A quirk for this model was originally added in 3127899, but c77900e
    removed it in favour of a more generic version.
    
    Unfortunately, pin configurations can changed based on firmware/BIOS
    versions, and the generic version doesn't have any effect on newer
    versions of the machine/firmware anymore.

    The debounce time unit for gpio_chip.set_debounce is us but
    mtk_gpio_set_debounce regard it as ms.
    Fix this by correct debounce time array dbnc_arr so it can find correct
    debounce setting. Debounce time for first debounce setting is 500us,
    correct this as well.
    
    While I'm at it, also change the debounce time array name to
    "debounce_time" for readability.

    nl80211: check netlink protocol in socket release notification
    
    [ Upstream commit 8f815cdde3e550e10c2736990d791f60c2ce43eb ]
    
    A non-privileged user can create a netlink socket with the same port_id as
    used by an existing open nl80211 netlink socket (e.g. as used by a hostapd
    process) with a different protocol number.
    
    Closing this socket will then lead to the notification going to nl80211's
    socket release notification handler, and possibly cause an action such as
    removing a virtual interface.
    
    Fix this issue by checking that the netlink protocol is NETLINK_GENERIC.
    Since generic netlink has no notifier chain of its own, we can't fix the
    problem more generically.

    netlink: don't send NETLINK_URELEASE for unbound sockets
    
    [ Upstream commit e27260203912b40751fa353d009eaa5a642c739f ]
    
    All existing users of NETLINK_URELEASE use it to clean up resources that
    were previously allocated to a socket via some command. As a result, no
    users require getting this notification for unbound sockets.
    
    Sending it for unbound sockets, however, is a problem because any user
    (including unprivileged users) can create a socket that uses the same ID
    as an existing socket. Binding this new socket will fail, but if the
    NETLINK_URELEASE notification is generated for such sockets, the users
    thereof will be tricked into thinking the socket that they allocated the
    resources for is closed.
    
    In the nl80211 case, this will cause destruction of virtual interfaces
    that still belong to an existing hostapd process; this is the case that
    Dmitry noticed. In the NFC case, it will cause a poll abort. In the case
    of netlink log/queue it will cause them to stop reporting events, as if
    NFULNL_CFG_CMD_UNBIND/NFQNL_CFG_CMD_UNBIND had been called.
    
    Fix this problem by checking that the socket is bound before generating
    the NETLINK_URELEASE notification.
