    ovl: hash directory inodes for fsnotify
    
    commit 31747eda41ef3c30c09c5c096b380bf54013746a upstream.
    
    fsnotify pins a watched directory inode in cache, but if directory dentry
    is released, new lookup will allocate a new dentry and a new inode.
    Directory events will be notified on the new inode, while fsnotify listener
    is watching the old pinned inode.
    
    Hash all directory inodes to reuse the pinned inode on lookup. Pure upper
    dirs are hashes by real upper inode, merge and lower dirs are hashed by
    real lower inode.
    
    The reference to lower inode was being held by the lower dentry object
    in the overlay dentry (oe->lowerstack[0]). Releasing the overlay dentry
    may drop lower inode refcount to zero. Add a refcount on behalf of the
    overlay inode to prevent that.
    
    As a by-product, hashing directory inodes also detects multiple
    redirected dirs to the same lower dir and uncovered redirected dir
    target on and returns -ESTALE on lookup.
    
    The reported issue dates back to initial version of overlayfs, but this
    patch depends on ovl_inode code that was introduced in kernel v4.13.

    ASoC: acpi: fix machine driver selection based on quirk
    
    commit 5c256045b87b8aa8e5bc9d2e2fdc0802351c1f99 upstream.
    
    The ACPI/machine-driver code refactoring introduced in 4.13 introduced
    a regression for cases where we need a DMI-based quirk to select the
    machine driver (the BIOS reports an invalid HID). The fix is just to
    make sure the results of the quirk are actually used.

    media: r820t: fix r820t_write_reg for KASAN
    
    commit 16c3ada89cff9a8c2a0eea34ffa1aa20af3f6008 upstream.
    
    With CONFIG_KASAN, we get an overly long stack frame due to inlining
    the register access functions:
    
    drivers/media/tuners/r820t.c: In function 'generic_set_freq.isra.7':
    drivers/media/tuners/r820t.c:1334:1: error: the frame size of 2880 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
    
    This is caused by a gcc bug that has now been fixed in gcc-8.
    To work around the problem, we can pass the register data
    through a local variable that older gcc versions can optimize
    out as well.

    commit 586b2a4befad88cd87b372a1cea01e58c6811ea9 upstream.
    
    The EB MP board probably has a character LCD but the board manual does
    not really state which IRQ it has assigned to this device. The invalid
    assignment was a mistake by me during submission of the DTSI where I was
    looking for the reference, didn't find it and didn't fill it in.

    ARM: dts: s5pv210: add interrupt-parent for ohci
    
    commit 5c1037196b9ee75897c211972de370ed1336ec8f upstream.
    
    The ohci-hcd node has an interrupt number but no interrupt-parent,
    leading to a warning with current dtc versions:
    
    arch/arm/boot/dts/s5pv210-aquila.dtb: Warning (interrupts_property): Missing interrupt-parent for /soc/ohci@ec300000
    arch/arm/boot/dts/s5pv210-goni.dtb: Warning (interrupts_property): Missing interrupt-parent for /soc/ohci@ec300000

    arch/arm/boot/dts/s5pv210-torbreck.dtb: Warning (interrupts_property): Missing interrupt-parent for /soc/ohci@ec300000
    
    As seen from the related exynos dts files, the ohci and ehci controllers
    always share one interrupt number, and the number is the same here as
    well, so setting the same interrupt-parent is the reasonable solution
    here.

    ARM: dts: exynos: fix RTC interrupt for exynos5410
    
    commit 5628a8ca14149ba4226e3bdce3a04c3b688435ad upstream.
    
    According to the comment added to exynos_dt_pmu_match[] in commit
    8b283c025443 ("ARM: exynos4/5: convert pmu wakeup to stacked domains"),
    the RTC is not able to wake up the system through the PMU on Exynos5410,
    unlike Exynos5420.
    
    However, when the RTC DT node got added, it was a straight copy of
    the Exynos5420 node, which now causes a warning from dtc.
    
    This removes the incorrect interrupt-parent, which should get the
    interrupt working and avoid the warning.

    x86/mm, mm/hwpoison: Don't unconditionally unmap kernel 1:1 pages
    
    commit fd0e786d9d09024f67bd71ec094b110237dc3840 upstream.
    
    In the following commit:
    
      ce0fa3e56ad2 ("x86/mm, mm/hwpoison: Clear PRESENT bit for kernel 1:1 mappings of poison pages")
    
    ... we added code to memory_failure() to unmap the page from the
    kernel 1:1 virtual address space to avoid speculative access to the
    page logging additional errors.
    
    But memory_failure() may not always succeed in taking the page offline,
    especially if the page belongs to the kernel.  This can happen if
    there are too many corrected errors on a page and either mcelog(8)
    or drivers/ras/cec.c asks to take a page offline.
    
    Since we remove the 1:1 mapping early in memory_failure(), we can
    end up with the page unmapped, but still in use. On the next access
    the kernel crashes :-(
    
    There are also various debug paths that call memory_failure() to simulate
    occurrence of an error. Since there is no actual error in memory, we
    don't need to map out the page for those cases.
    
    Revert most of the previous attempt and keep the solution local to
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce.c. Unmap the page only when:
    
            1) there is a real error
            2) memory_failure() succeeds.
    
    All of this only applies to 64-bit systems. 32-bit kernel doesn't map
    all of memory into kernel space. It isn't worth adding the code to unmap
    the piece that is mapped because nobody would run a 32-bit kernel on a
    machine that has recoverable machine checks.

    usb: Move USB_UHCI_BIG_ENDIAN_* out of USB_SUPPORT
    
    commit ec897569ad7dbc6d595873a487c3fac23f463f76 upstream.
    
    Move the Kconfig symbols USB_UHCI_BIG_ENDIAN_MMIO and
    USB_UHCI_BIG_ENDIAN_DESC out of drivers/usb/host/Kconfig, which is
    conditional upon USB && USB_SUPPORT, so that it can be freely selected
    by platform Kconfig symbols in architecture code.
    
    For example once the MIPS_GENERIC platform selects are fixed in commit

    32r6_defconfig warns like so:

    The driver loads doesn't load any multicast entries if "allmulti" is not
    set. This condition should be reversed.
    
    The condition !netdev_mc_empty(dev) is useless (because
    netdev_for_each_mc_addr is nop if the list is empty).
    
    This patch also fixes a possible overflow of the multicast list - if
    mvpp2_prs_mac_da_accept fails, we set the allmulti flag and retry.

    ALSA: seq: Fix racy pool initializations
    
    commit d15d662e89fc667b90cd294b0eb45694e33144da upstream.
    
    ALSA sequencer core initializes the event pool on demand by invoking
    snd_seq_pool_init() when the first write happens and the pool is
    empty.  Meanwhile user can reset the pool size manually via ioctl
    concurrently, and this may lead to UAF or out-of-bound accesses since
    the function tries to vmalloc / vfree the buffer.
    
    A simple fix is to just wrap the snd_seq_pool_init() call with the
    recently introduced client->ioctl_mutex; as the calls for
    snd_seq_pool_init() from other side are always protected with this
    mutex, we can avoid the race.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: PCI quirk for Fujitsu U7x7
    
    commit fdcc968a3b290407bcba9d4c90e2fba6d8d928f1 upstream.
    
    These laptops have a combined jack to attach headsets, the U727 on
    the left, the U757 on the right, but a headsets microphone doesn't
    work. Using hdajacksensetest I found that pin 0x19 changed the
    present state when plugging the headset, in addition to 0x21, but
    didn't have the correct configuration (shown as "Not connected").
    
    So this sets the configuration to the same values as the headphone
    pin 0x21 except for the device type microphone, which makes it
    work correctly. With the patch the configured pins for U727 are
    
    Pin 0x12 (Internal Mic, Mobile-In): present = No
    Pin 0x14 (Internal Speaker): present = No
    Pin 0x19 (Black Mic, Left side): present = No
    Pin 0x1d (Internal Aux): present = No
    Pin 0x21 (Black Headphone, Left side): present = No

    Btrfs: fix unexpected -EEXIST when creating new inode
    
    commit 900c9981680067573671ecc5cbfa7c5770be3a40 upstream.
    
    The highest objectid, which is assigned to new inode, is decided at
    the time of initializing fs roots.  However, in cases where log replay
    gets processed, the btree which fs root owns might be changed, so we
    have to search it again for the highest objectid, otherwise creating
    new inode would end up with -EEXIST.

    b) clear_inode() must be called before ->evict_inode() returns.
    
    This could end up hitting BUG_ON(inode->i_state != (I_FREEING | I_CLEAR));
    in evict() because I_CLEAR is set in clear_inode().

    dm: correctly handle chained bios in dec_pending()
    
    commit 8dd601fa8317243be887458c49f6c29c2f3d719f upstream.
    
    dec_pending() is given an error status (possibly 0) to be recorded
    against a bio.  It can be called several times on the one 'struct
    dm_io', and it is careful to only assign a non-zero error to
    io->status.  However when it then assigned io->status to bio->bi_status,
    it is not careful and could overwrite a genuine error status with 0.
    
    This can happen when chained bios are in use.  If a bio is chained
    beneath the bio that this dm_io is handling, the child bio might
    complete and set bio->bi_status before the dm_io completes.
    
    This has been possible since chained bios were introduced in 3.14, and
    has become a lot easier to trigger with commit 18a25da84354 ("dm: ensure
    bio submission follows a depth-first tree walk") as that commit caused
    dm to start using chained bios itself.
    
    A particular failure mode is that if a bio spans an 'error' target and a
    working target, the 'error' fragment will complete instantly and set the
    ->bi_status, and the other fragment will normally complete a little
    later, and will clear ->bi_status.
    
    The fix is simply to only assign io_error to bio->bi_status when
    io_error is not zero.

    is still blocked in sock_recvmsg().
    
    Nicholas Bellinger says:
      It would indicate users providing their own ->sk_data_ready() callback
      must be responsible for waking up a kthread context blocked on
      sock_recvmsg(..., MSG_WAITALL), when a second ->sk_data_ready() is
      received before the first sock_recvmsg(..., MSG_WAITALL) completes.
    
    So, do this and invoke the original data_ready() callback -- in
    case of tcp sockets this takes care of waking the thread.
    
    Disclaimer: I do not understand why this problem did not show up before
    tcp prequeue removal.

    blk-wbt: account flush requests correctly
    
    commit 5235553d821433e1f4fa720fd025d2c4b7ee9994 upstream.
    
    Mikulas reported a workload that saw bad performance, and figured
    out what it was due to various other types of requests being
    accounted as reads. Flush requests, for instance. Due to the
    high latency of those, we heavily throttle the writes to keep
    the latencies in balance. But they really should be accounted
    as writes.
    
    Fix this by checking the exact type of the request. If it's a
    read, account as a read, if it's a write or a flush, account
    as a write. Any other request we disregard. Previously everything
    would have been mistakenly accounted as reads.

    xprtrdma: Fix BUG after a device removal
    
    commit e89e8d8fcdc6751e86ccad794b052fe67e6ad619 upstream.
    
    Michal Kalderon reports a BUG that occurs just after device removal:
    
    [  169.112490] rpcrdma: removing device qedr0 for 192.168.110.146:20049
    [  169.143909] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000010
    [  169.181837] IP: rpcrdma_dma_unmap_regbuf+0xa/0x60 [rpcrdma]
    
    The RPC/RDMA client transport attempts to allocate some resources
    on demand. Registered buffers are one such resource. These are
    allocated (or re-allocated) by xprt_rdma_allocate to hold RPC Call
    and Reply messages. A hardware resource is associated with each of
    these buffers, as they can be used for a Send or Receive Work
    Request.
    
    If a device is removed from under an NFS/RDMA mount, the transport
    layer is responsible for releasing all hardware resources before
    the device can be finally unplugged. A BUG results when the NFS
    mount hasn't yet seen much activity: the transport tries to release
    resources that haven't yet been allocated.
    
    rpcrdma_free_regbuf() already checks for this case, so just move
    that check to cover the DEVICE_REMOVAL case as well.

    xprtrdma: Fix calculation of ri_max_send_sges
    
    commit 1179e2c27efe21167ec9d882b14becefba2ee990 upstream.
    
    Commit 16f906d66cd7 ("xprtrdma: Reduce required number of send
    SGEs") introduced the rpcrdma_ia::ri_max_send_sges field. This fixes
    a problem where xprtrdma would not work if the device's max_sge
    capability was small (low single digits).
    
    At least RPCRDMA_MIN_SEND_SGES are needed for the inline parts of
    each RPC. ri_max_send_sges is set to this value:
    
      ia->ri_max_send_sges = max_sge - RPCRDMA_MIN_SEND_SGES;
    
    Then when marshaling each RPC, rpcrdma_args_inline uses that value
    to determine whether the device has enough Send SGEs to convey an
    NFS WRITE payload inline, or whether instead a Read chunk is
    required.
    
    More recently, commit ae72950abf99 ("xprtrdma: Add data structure to
    manage RDMA Send arguments") used the ri_max_send_sges value to
    calculate the size of an array, but that commit erroneously assumed
    ri_max_send_sges contains a value similar to the device's max_sge,
    and not one that was reduced by the minimum SGE count.
    
    This assumption results in the calculated size of the sendctx's
    Send SGE array to be too small. When the array is used to marshal
    an RPC, the code can write Send SGEs into the following sendctx
    element in that array, corrupting it. When the device's max_sge is
    large, this issue is entirely harmless; but it results in an oops
    in the provider's post_send method, if dev.attrs.max_sge is small.
    
    So let's straighten this out: ri_max_send_sges will now contain a
    value with the same meaning as dev.attrs.max_sge, which makes
    the code easier to understand, and enables rpcrdma_sendctx_create
    to calculate the size of the SGE array correctly.

    drm/qxl: reapply cursor after resetting primary
    
    commit 9428088c90b6f7d5edd2a1b0d742c75339b36f6e upstream.
    
    QXL associates mouse state with its primary plane.
    
    Destroying a primary plane and putting a new one in place has the side
    effect of destroying the cursor as well.
    
    This commit changes the driver to reapply the cursor any time a new
    primary is created. It achieves this by keeping a reference to the
    cursor bo on the qxl_crtc struct.
    
    This fix is very similar to
    
    commit 4532b241a4b7 ("drm/qxl: reapply cursor after SetCrtc calls")
    
    which got implicitly reverted as part of implementing the atomic
    modeset feature.

    qxl: alloc & use shadow for dumb buffers
    
    commit 62676d10b483a2ff6e8b08c5e7c7d63a831343f5 upstream.
    
    This patch changes the way the primary surface is used for dumb
    framebuffers.  Instead of configuring the bo itself as primary surface
    a shadow bo is created and used instead.  Framebuffers can share the
    shadow bo in case they have the same format and resolution.
    
    On atomic plane updates we don't have to update the primary surface in
    case we pageflip from one framebuffer to another framebuffer which
    shares the same shadow.  This in turn avoids the flicker caused by the
    primary-destroy + primary-create cycle, which is very annonying when
    running wayland on qxl.
    
    The qxl driver never actually writes to the shadow bo.  It sends qxl
    blit commands which update it though, and the spice server might
    actually execute them (and thereby write to the shadow) in case the
    local rendering is kicked for some reason.  This happens for example in
    case qemu is asked to write out a dump of the guest display (screendump
    monitor command).

    arm64: proc: Set PTE_NG for table entries to avoid traversing them twice
    
    commit 2ce77f6d8a9ae9ce6d80397d88bdceb84a2004cd upstream.
    
    When KASAN is enabled, the swapper page table contains many identical
    mappings of the zero page, which can lead to a stall during boot whilst
    the G -> nG code continually walks the same page table entries looking
    for global mappings.
    
    This patch sets the nG bit (bit 11, which is IGNORED) in table entries
    after processing the subtree so we can easily skip them if we see them
    a second time.

    rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Fix connection lost problem correctly
    
    commit c713fb071edc0efc01a955f65a006b0e1795d2eb upstream.
    
    There has been a coding error in rtl8821ae since it was first introduced,
    namely that an 8-bit register was read using a 16-bit read in
    _rtl8821ae_dbi_read(). This error was fixed with commit 40b368af4b75
    ("rtlwifi: Fix alignment issues"); however, this change led to
    instability in the connection. To restore stability, this change
    was reverted in commit b8b8b16352cd ("rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Fix connection
    lost problem").
    
    Unfortunately, the unaligned access causes machine checks in ARM
    architecture, and we were finally forced to find the actual cause of the
    problem on x86 platforms. Following a suggestion from Pkshih
    <pkshih@realtek.com>, it was found that increasing the ASPM L1
    latency from 0 to 7 fixed the instability. This parameter was varied to
    see if a smaller value would work; however, it appears that 7 is the
    safest value. A new symbol is defined for this quantity, thus it can be
    easily changed if necessary.

    tracing: Fix parsing of globs with a wildcard at the beginning
    
    commit 07234021410bbc27b7c86c18de98616c29fbe667 upstream.
    
    Al Viro reported:
    
        For substring - sure, but what about something like "*a*b" and "a*b"?
        AFAICS, filter_parse_regex() ends up with identical results in both
        cases - MATCH_GLOB and *search = "a*b".  And no way for the caller
        to tell one from another.
    
    Testing this with the following:
    
     # cd /sys/kernel/tracing
     # echo '*raw*lock' > set_ftrace_filter
     bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
    
    With this patch:
    
     # echo '*raw*lock' > set_ftrace_filter
     # cat set_ftrace_filter
    _raw_read_trylock
    _raw_write_trylock
    _raw_read_unlock
    _raw_spin_unlock
    _raw_write_unlock
    _raw_spin_trylock
    _raw_spin_lock
    _raw_write_lock
    _raw_read_lock
    
    Al recommended not setting the search buffer to skip the first '*' unless we
    know we are not using MATCH_GLOB. This implements his suggested logic.

    xenbus: track caller request id
    
    commit 29fee6eed2811ff1089b30fc579a2d19d78016ab upstream.
    
    Commit fd8aa9095a95 ("xen: optimize xenbus driver for multiple concurrent
    xenstore accesses") optimized xenbus concurrent accesses but in doing so
    broke UABI of /dev/xen/xenbus. Through /dev/xen/xenbus applications are in
    charge of xenbus message exchange with the correct header and body. Now,
    after the mentioned commit the replies received by application will no
    longer have the header req_id echoed back as it was on request (see
    specification below for reference), because that particular field is being
    overwritten by kernel.
    
    struct xsd_sockmsg
    {
      uint32_t type;  /* XS_??? */
      uint32_t req_id;/* Request identifier, echoed in daemon's response.  */
      uint32_t tx_id; /* Transaction id (0 if not related to a transaction). */
      uint32_t len;   /* Length of data following this. */
    
      /* Generally followed by nul-terminated string(s). */
    };
    
    Before there was only one request at a time so req_id could simply be
    forwarded back and forth. To allow simultaneous requests we need a
    different req_id for each message thus kernel keeps a monotonic increasing
    counter for this field and is written on every request irrespective of
    userspace value.
    
    Forwarding again the req_id on userspace requests is not a solution because
    we would open the possibility of userspace-generated req_id colliding with
    kernel ones. So this patch instead takes another route which is to
    artificially keep user req_id while keeping the xenbus logic as is. We do
    that by saving the original req_id before xs_send(), use the private kernel
    counter as req_id and then once reply comes and was validated, we restore
    back the original req_id.

    When this method is set, the caller expects struct console_font fields
    to be properly initialized when it returns. Leave it unset otherwise
    nonsensical (leaked kernel stack) values are returned to user space.

    video: fbdev: atmel_lcdfb: fix display-timings lookup
    
    commit 9cb18db0701f6b74f0c45c23ad767b3ebebe37f6 upstream.
    
    Fix child-node lookup during probe, which ended up searching the whole
    device tree depth-first starting at the parent rather than just matching
    on its children.
    
    To make things worse, the parent display node was also prematurely
    freed.
    
    Note that the display and timings node references are never put after a
    successful dt-initialisation so the nodes would leak on later probe
    deferrals and on driver unbind.

    PCI: keystone: Fix interrupt-controller-node lookup

    To make things worse, the parent pci node could end up being prematurely

    PCI: iproc: Fix NULL pointer dereference for BCMA
    
    commit 3b65ca50d24ce33cb92d88840e289135c92b40ed upstream.
    
    With the inbound DMA mapping supported added, the iProc PCIe driver
    parses DT property "dma-ranges" through call to
    "of_pci_dma_range_parser_init()". In the case of BCMA, this results in a
    NULL pointer deference due to a missing of_node.
    
    Fix this by adding a guard in pcie-iproc-platform.c to only enable the
    inbound DMA mapping logic when DT property "dma-ranges" is present.

    MIPS: Fix incorrect mem=X@Y handling
    
    commit 67a3ba25aa955198196f40b76b329b3ab9ad415a upstream.
    
    Commit 73fbc1eba7ff ("MIPS: fix mem=X@Y commandline processing") added a
    fix to ensure that the memory range between PHYS_OFFSET and low memory
    address specified by mem= cmdline argument is not later processed by
    free_all_bootmem.  This change was incorrect for systems where the
    commandline specifies more than 1 mem argument, as it will cause all
    memory between PHYS_OFFSET and each of the memory offsets to be marked
    as reserved, which results in parts of the RAM marked as reserved
    (Creator CI20's u-boot has a default commandline argument 'mem=256M@0x0
    mem=768M@0x30000000').
    
    Change the behaviour to ensure that only the range between PHYS_OFFSET
    and the lowest start address of the memories is marked as protected.
    
    This change also ensures that the range is marked protected even if it's
    only defined through the devicetree and not only via commandline
    arguments.

    ext4: fix a race in the ext4 shutdown path
    
    commit abbc3f9395c76d554a9ed27d4b1ebfb5d9b0e4ca upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a race between the shutdown path and bio completion
    handling. In the ext4 direct io path with async io, after submitting a
    bio to the block layer, if journal starting fails,
    ext4_direct_IO_write() would bail out pretending that the IO
    failed. The caller would have had no way of knowing whether or not the
    IO was successfully submitted. So instead, we return -EIOCBQUEUED in
    this case. Now, the caller knows that the IO was submitted.  The bio
    completion handler takes care of the error.
    
    Tested: Ran the shutdown xfstest test 461 in loop for over 2 hours across
    4 machines resulting in over 400 runs. Verified that the race didn't
    occur. Usually the race was seen in about 20-30 iterations.

    Revert "apple-gmux: lock iGP IO to protect from vgaarb changes"
    
    commit d6fa7588fd7a8def4c747c0c574ce85d453e3788 upstream.
    
    Commit 4eebd5a4e726 ("apple-gmux: lock iGP IO to protect from vgaarb
    changes") amended this driver's ->probe hook to lock decoding of normal
    (non-legacy) I/O space accesses to the integrated GPU on dual-GPU
    MacBook Pros.  The lock stays in place until the driver is unbound.
    
    The change was made to work around an issue with the out-of-tree nvidia
    graphics driver (available at http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html).
    It contains the following sequence in nvidia/nv.c:
    
            #if defined(CONFIG_VGA_ARB) && !defined(NVCPU_PPC64LE)
            #if defined(VGA_DEFAULT_DEVICE)
                vga_tryget(VGA_DEFAULT_DEVICE, VGA_RSRC_LEGACY_MASK);
            #endif
                vga_set_legacy_decoding(dev, VGA_RSRC_NONE);
            #endif
    
    This code was reported to cause deadlocks with VFIO already in 2013:
    https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/545560
    
    I've reported the issue to Nvidia developers once more in 2017:
    https://www.spinics.net/lists/dri-devel/msg138754.html
    
    On the MacBookPro10,1, this code apparently breaks backlight control
    (which is handled by apple-gmux via an I/O region starting at 0x700),
    as reported by Petri Hodju:
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86121
    
    I tried to replicate Petri's observations on my MacBook9,1, which uses
    the same Intel Ivy Bridge + Nvidia GeForce GT 650M architecture, to no
    avail.  On my machine apple-gmux' I/O region remains accessible even
    with the nvidia driver loaded and commit 4eebd5a4e726 reverted.
    Petri reported that apple-gmux becomes accessible again after a
    suspend/resume cycle because the BIOS changed the VGA routing on the
    root port to the Nvidia GPU.  Perhaps this is a BIOS issue after all
    that can be fixed with an update?
    
    In any case, the change made by commit 4eebd5a4e726 has turned out to
    cause two new issues:
    
    * Wilfried Klaebe reports a deadlock when launching Xorg because it
      opens /dev/vga_arbiter and calls vga_get(), but apple-gmux is holding
      a lock on I/O space indefinitely.  It looks like apple-gmux' current
      behavior is an abuse of the vgaarb API as locks are not meant to be
      held for longer periods:
      https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88861#c11
      https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=217541
    
    * On dual GPU MacBook Pros introduced since 2013, the integrated GPU is
      powergated on boot und thus becomes invisible to Linux unless a custom
      EFI protocol is used to leave it powered on.  (A patch exists but is
      not in mainline yet due to several negative side effects.)  On these
      machines, locking I/O to the integrated GPU (as done by 4eebd5a4e726)
      fails and backlight control is therefore broken:
      https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105051
    
    So let's revert commit 4eebd5a4e726 please.  Users experiencing the
    issue with the proprietary nvidia driver can comment out the above-
    quoted problematic code as a workaround (or try updating the BIOS).

    This reverts commit 0a44697627d17a66d7dc98f17aeca07ca79c5c20.
    
    This commit was initially intended to fix problems with hs200 and hs400
    on some boards, mainly the odroid-c2. The OC2 (Rev 0.2) I have performs
    well in this modes, so I could not confirm these issues.
    
    We've had several reports about the issues being still present on (some)
    OC2, so apparently, this change does not do what it was supposed to do.
    Maybe the eMMC signal quality is on the edge on the board. This may
    explain the variability we see in term of stability, but this is just a
    guess. Lowering the max_frequency to 100Mhz seems to do trick for those
    affected by the issue
    
    Worse, the commit created new issues (CRC errors and hangs) on other
    boards, such as the kvim 1 and 2, the p200 or the libretech-cc.
    
    According to amlogic, the Tx phase should not be tuned and left in its
    default configuration, so it is best to just revert the commit.

    mmc: sdhci: Implement an SDHCI-specific bounce buffer
    
    commit bd9b902798ab14d19ca116b10bde581ddff8f905 upstream.
    
    The bounce buffer is gone from the MMC core, and now we found out
    that there are some (crippled) i.MX boards out there that have broken
    ADMA (cannot do scatter-gather), and also broken PIO so they must
    use SDMA. Closer examination shows a less significant slowdown
    also on SDMA-only capable Laptop hosts.
    
    SDMA sets down the number of segments to one, so that each segment
    gets turned into a singular request that ping-pongs to the block
    layer before the next request/segment is issued.
    
    Apparently it happens a lot that the block layer send requests
    that include a lot of physically discontiguous segments. My guess
    is that this phenomenon is coming from the file system.
    
    These devices that cannot handle scatterlists in hardware can see
    major benefits from a DMA-contiguous bounce buffer.
    
    This patch accumulates those fragmented scatterlists in a physically
    contiguous bounce buffer so that we can issue bigger DMA data chunks
    to/from the card.
    
    When tested with a PCI-integrated host (1217:8221) that
    only supports SDMA:
    0b:00.0 SD Host controller: O2 Micro, Inc. OZ600FJ0/OZ900FJ0/OZ600FJS
            SD/MMC Card Reader Controller (rev 05)
    This patch gave ~1Mbyte/s improved throughput on large reads and
    writes when testing using iozone than without the patch.
    
    dmesg:
    sdhci-pci 0000:0b:00.0: SDHCI controller found [1217:8221] (rev 5)
    mmc0 bounce up to 128 segments into one, max segment size 65536 bytes
    mmc0: SDHCI controller on PCI [0000:0b:00.0] using DMA
    
    On the i.MX SDHCI controllers on the crippled i.MX 25 and i.MX 35
    the patch restores the performance to what it was before we removed
    the bounce buffers.

    rtc-opal: Fix handling of firmware error codes, prevent busy loops
    
    commit 5b8b58063029f02da573120ef4dc9079822e3cda upstream.
    
    According to the OPAL docs:
      skiboot-5.2.5/doc/opal-api/opal-rtc-read-3.txt
      skiboot-5.2.5/doc/opal-api/opal-rtc-write-4.txt
    
    OPAL_HARDWARE may be returned from OPAL_RTC_READ or OPAL_RTC_WRITE and
    this indicates either a transient or permanent error.
    
    Prior to this patch, Linux was not dealing with OPAL_HARDWARE being a
    permanent error particularly well, in that you could end up in a busy
    loop.
    
    This was not too hard to trigger on an AMI BMC based OpenPOWER machine
    doing a continuous "ipmitool mc reset cold" to the BMC, the result of
    that being that we'd get stuck in an infinite loop in
    opal_get_rtc_time().
    
    We now retry a few times before returning the error higher up the
    stack.

    A BO that's already swapped would be added back to the swap-LRU list
    for example if its validation failed under high memory pressure. This
    could later lead to swapping it out again and leaking previous swap

    x86/entry/64: Fix CR3 restore in paranoid_exit()
    
    commit e48657573481a5dff7cfdc3d57005c80aa816500 upstream.
    
    Josh Poimboeuf noticed the following bug:
    
     "The paranoid exit code only restores the saved CR3 when it switches back
      to the user GS.  However, even in the kernel GS case, it's possible that
      it needs to restore a user CR3, if for example, the paranoid exception
      occurred in the syscall exit path between SWITCH_TO_USER_CR3_STACK and
      SWAPGS."
    
    Josh also confirmed via targeted testing that it's possible to hit this bug.
    
    Fix the bug by also restoring CR3 in the paranoid_exit_no_swapgs branch.
    
    The reason we haven't seen this bug reported by users yet is probably because
    "paranoid" entry points are limited to the following cases:
    
     idtentry double_fault       do_double_fault  has_error_code=1  paranoid=2
     idtentry debug              do_debug         has_error_code=0  paranoid=1 shift_ist=DEBUG_STACK
     idtentry int3               do_int3          has_error_code=0  paranoid=1 shift_ist=DEBUG_STACK
     idtentry machine_check      do_mce           has_error_code=0  paranoid=1
    
    Amongst those entry points only machine_check is one that will interrupt an
    IRQS-off critical section asynchronously - and machine check events are rare.
    
    The other main asynchronous entries are NMI entries, which can be very high-freq
    with perf profiling, but they are special: they don't use the 'idtentry' macro but
    are open coded and restore user CR3 unconditionally so don't have this bug.

    x86/cpu: Change type of x86_cache_size variable to unsigned int
    
    commit 24dbc6000f4b9b0ef5a9daecb161f1907733765a upstream.
    
    Currently, x86_cache_size is of type int, which makes no sense as we
    will never have a valid cache size equal or less than 0. So instead of
    initializing this variable to -1, it can perfectly be initialized to 0
    and use it as an unsigned variable instead.

    x86/mm: Rename flush_tlb_single() and flush_tlb_one() to __flush_tlb_one_[user|kernel]()
    
    commit 1299ef1d8870d2d9f09a5aadf2f8b2c887c2d033 upstream.
    
    flush_tlb_single() and flush_tlb_one() sound almost identical, but
    they really mean "flush one user translation" and "flush one kernel
    translation".  Rename them to flush_tlb_one_user() and
    flush_tlb_one_kernel() to make the semantics more obvious.
    
    [ I was looking at some PTI-related code, and the flush-one-address code
      is unnecessarily hard to understand because the names of the helpers are
      uninformative.  This came up during PTI review, but no one got around to
      doing it. ]

    kmemcheck: remove annotations
    
    commit 4950276672fce5c241857540f8561c440663673d upstream.
    
    Patch series "kmemcheck: kill kmemcheck", v2.
    
    As discussed at LSF/MM, kill kmemcheck.
    
    KASan is a replacement that is able to work without the limitation of
    kmemcheck (single CPU, slow).  KASan is already upstream.
    
    We are also not aware of any users of kmemcheck (or users who don't
    consider KASan as a suitable replacement).
    
    The only objection was that since KASAN wasn't supported by all GCC
    versions provided by distros at that time we should hold off for 2
    years, and try again.
    
    Now that 2 years have passed, and all distros provide gcc that supports
    KASAN, kill kmemcheck again for the very same reasons.
    
    This patch (of 4):
    
    Remove kmemcheck annotations, and calls to kmemcheck from the kernel.

    commit 8fa80c503b484ddc1abbd10c7cb2ab81f3824a50 upstream.
    
    For architectures providing their own implementation of
    array_index_mask_nospec() in asm/barrier.h, attempting to use WARN_ONCE() to
    complain about out-of-range parameters using WARN_ON() results in a mess
    of mutually-dependent include files.
    
    Rather than unpick the dependencies, simply have the core code in nospec.h
    perform the checking for us.

    x86/debug: Use UD2 for WARN()
    
    commit 3b3a371cc9bc980429baabe0a8e5f307f3d1f463 upstream.
    
    Since the Intel SDM added an ModR/M byte to UD0 and binutils followed
    that specification, we now cannot disassemble our kernel anymore.
    
    This now means Intel and AMD disagree on the encoding of UD0. And instead
    of playing games with additional bytes that are valid ModR/M and single
    byte instructions (0xd6 for instance), simply use UD2 for both WARN() and
    BUG().

    x86/debug, objtool: Annotate WARN()-related UD2 as reachable
    
    commit 2b5db66862b95532cb6cca8165ae6eb73633cf85 upstream.
    
    By default, objtool assumes that a UD2 is a dead end.  This is mainly
    because GCC 7+ sometimes inserts a UD2 when it detects a divide-by-zero
    condition.
    
    Now that WARN() is moving back to UD2, annotate the code after it as
    reachable so objtool can follow the code flow.

    objtool: Fix segfault in ignore_unreachable_insn()
    
    commit fe24e27128252c230a34a6c628da2bf1676781ea upstream.
    
    Peter Zijlstra's patch for converting WARN() to use UD2 triggered a
    bunch of false "unreachable instruction" warnings, which then triggered
    a seg fault in ignore_unreachable_insn().
    
    The seg fault happened when it tried to dereference a NULL 'insn->func'
    pointer.  Thanks to static_cpu_has(), some functions can jump to a
    non-function area in the .altinstr_aux section.  That breaks
    ignore_unreachable_insn()'s assumption that it's always inside the
    original function.
    
    Make sure ignore_unreachable_insn() only follows jumps within the
    current function.

    selftests/x86: Disable tests requiring 32-bit support on pure 64-bit systems
    
    commit 9279ddf23ce78ff2676e8e8e19fec0f022c26d04 upstream.
    
    The ldt_gdt and ptrace_syscall selftests, even in their 64-bit variant, use
    hard-coded 32-bit syscall numbers and call "int $0x80".
    
    This will fail on 64-bit systems with CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION=y disabled.
    
    Therefore, do not build these tests if we cannot build 32-bit binaries
    (which should be a good approximation for CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION=y being enabled).

    commit 4105c69703cdeba76f384b901712c9397b04e9c2 upstream.
    
    On 64-bit builds, we should not rely on "int $0x80" working (it only does if
    CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION=y is enabled). To keep the "Set TF and check int80"
    test running on 64-bit installs with CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION=y enabled, build
    this test only if we can also build 32-bit binaries (which should be a

    x86/entry/64: Fix paranoid_entry() frame pointer warning
    
    commit b3ccefaed922529e6a67de7b30af5aa38c76ace9 upstream.
    
    With the following commit:
    
      f09d160992d1 ("x86/entry/64: Get rid of the ALLOC_PT_GPREGS_ON_STACK and SAVE_AND_CLEAR_REGS macros")
    
    ... one of my suggested improvements triggered a frame pointer warning:
    
      arch/x86/entry/entry_64.o: warning: objtool: paranoid_entry()+0x11: call without frame pointer save/setup
    
    The warning is correct for the build-time code, but it's actually not
    relevant at runtime because of paravirt patching.  The paravirt swapgs
    call gets replaced with either a SWAPGS instruction or NOPs at runtime.
    
    Go back to the previous behavior by removing the ELF function annotation
    for paranoid_entry() and adding an unwind hint, which effectively
    silences the warning.

    x86/entry/64: Get rid of the ALLOC_PT_GPREGS_ON_STACK and SAVE_AND_CLEAR_REGS macros
    
    commit dde3036d62ba3375840b10ab9ec0d568fd773b07 upstream.
    
    Previously, error_entry() and paranoid_entry() saved the GP registers
    onto stack space previously allocated by its callers. Combine these two
    steps in the callers, and use the generic PUSH_AND_CLEAR_REGS macro
    for that.
    
    This adds a significant amount ot text size. However, Ingo Molnar points
    out that:
    
            "these numbers also _very_ significantly over-represent the
            extra footprint. The assumptions that resulted in
            us compressing the IRQ entry code have changed very
            significantly with the new x86 IRQ allocation code we
            introduced in the last year:
    
            - IRQ vectors are usually populated in tightly clustered
              groups.
    
              With our new vector allocator code the typical per CPU
              allocation percentage on x86 systems is ~3 device vectors
              and ~10 fixed vectors out of ~220 vectors - i.e. a very
              low ~6% utilization (!). [...]
    
              The days where we allocated a lot of vectors on every
              CPU and the compression of the IRQ entry code text
              mattered are over.
    
            - Another issue is that only a small minority of vectors
              is frequent enough to actually matter to cache utilization
              in practice: 3-4 key IPIs and 1-2 device IRQs at most - and
              those vectors tend to be tightly clustered as well into about
              two groups, and are probably already on 2-3 cache lines in
              practice.
    
              For the common case of 'cache cold' IRQs it's the depth of
              the call chain and the fragmentation of the resulting I$
              that should be the main performance limit - not the overall
              size of it.
    
            - The CPU side cost of IRQ delivery is still very expensive
              even in the best, most cached case, as in 'over a thousand
              cycles'. So much stuff is done that maybe contemporary x86
              IRQ entry microcode already prefetches the IDT entry and its
              expected call target address."[*]

    The "testb $3, CS(%rsp)" instruction in the idtentry macro does not need
    modification. Previously, %rsp was manually decreased by 15*8; with
    this patch, %rsp is decreased by 15 pushq instructions.

    commit 30907fd13bb593202574bb20af58d67c70a1ee14 upstream.
    
    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe() and nmi() can be converted to use
    PUSH_AND_CLEAN_REGS instead of opencoded variants thereof. Due to
    the interleaving, the additional XOR-based clearing of R8 and R9
    in entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe() should not have any noticeable
    negative implications.

    x86/entry/64: Introduce the PUSH_AND_CLEAN_REGS macro
    
    commit 3f01daecd545e818098d84fd1ad43e19a508d705 upstream.
    
    Those instances where ALLOC_PT_GPREGS_ON_STACK is called just before
    SAVE_AND_CLEAR_REGS can trivially be replaced by PUSH_AND_CLEAN_REGS.
    This macro uses PUSH instead of MOV and should therefore be faster, at
    least on newer CPUs.

    commit 2e3f0098bc45f710a2f4cbcc94b80a1fae7a99a1 upstream.
    
    All current code paths call SAVE_C_REGS and then immediately
    SAVE_EXTRA_REGS. Therefore, merge these two macros and order the MOV
    sequeneces properly.
    
    While at it, remove the macros to save all except specific registers,
    as these macros have been unused for a long time.

    x86/entry/64: Clear registers for exceptions/interrupts, to reduce speculation attack surface
    
    commit 3ac6d8c787b835b997eb23e43e09aa0895ef7d58 upstream.
    
    Clear the 'extra' registers on entering the 64-bit kernel for exceptions
    and interrupts. The common registers are not cleared since they are
    likely clobbered well before they can be exploited in a speculative
    execution attack.

    KVM/nVMX: Set the CPU_BASED_USE_MSR_BITMAPS if we have a valid L02 MSR bitmap
    
    commit 3712caeb14dcb33fb4d5114f14c0beef10aca101 upstream.
    
    We either clear the CPU_BASED_USE_MSR_BITMAPS and end up intercepting all
    MSR accesses or create a valid L02 MSR bitmap and use that. This decision
    has to be made every time we evaluate whether we are going to generate the
    L02 MSR bitmap.
    
    Before commit:
    
      d28b387fb74d ("KVM/VMX: Allow direct access to MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL")
    
    ... this was probably OK since the decision was always identical.
    
    This is no longer the case now since the MSR bitmap might actually
    change once we decide to not intercept SPEC_CTRL and PRED_CMD.

    commit 206587a9fb764d71f035dc7f6d3b6488f5d5b304 upstream.
    
    These two variables should check whether SPEC_CTRL and PRED_CMD are
    supposed to be passed through to L2 guests or not. While
    msr_write_intercepted_l01 would return 'true' if it is not passed through.
    
    So just invert the result of msr_write_intercepted_l01 to implement the
    correct semantics.

    KVM/x86: Reduce retpoline performance impact in slot_handle_level_range(), by always inlining iterator helper methods
    
    commit 928a4c39484281f8ca366f53a1db79330d058401 upstream.
    
    With retpoline, tight loops of "call this function for every XXX" are
    very much pessimised by taking a prediction miss *every* time. This one
    is by far the biggest contributor to the guest launch time with retpoline.
    
    By marking the iterator slot_handle_…() functions always_inline, we can
    ensure that the indirect function call can be optimised away into a
    direct call and it actually generates slightly smaller code because
    some of the other conditionals can get optimised away too.
    
    Performance is now pretty close to what we see with nospectre_v2 on
    the command line.

    Revert "x86/speculation: Simplify indirect_branch_prediction_barrier()"
    
    commit f208820a321f9b23d77d7eed89945d862d62a3ed upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 64e16720ea0879f8ab4547e3b9758936d483909b.
    
    We cannot call C functions like that, without marking all the
    call-clobbered registers as, well, clobbered. We might have got away
    with it for now because the __ibp_barrier() function was *fairly*
    unlikely to actually use any other registers. But no. Just no.

    x86/speculation: Correct Speculation Control microcode blacklist again
    
    commit d37fc6d360a404b208547ba112e7dabb6533c7fc upstream.
    
    Arjan points out that the Intel document only clears the 0xc2 microcode
    on *some* parts with CPUID 506E3 (INTEL_FAM6_SKYLAKE_DESKTOP stepping 3).
    For the Skylake H/S platform it's OK but for Skylake E3 which has the
    same CPUID it isn't (yet) cleared.
    
    So removing it from the blacklist was premature. Put it back for now.
    
    Also, Arjan assures me that the 0x84 microcode for Kaby Lake which was
    featured in one of the early revisions of the Intel document was never
    released to the public, and won't be until/unless it is also validated
    as safe. So those can change to 0x80 which is what all *other* versions
    of the doc have identified.
    
    Once the retrospective testing of existing public microcodes is done, we
    should be back into a mode where new microcodes are only released in
    batches and we shouldn't even need to update the blacklist for those
    anyway, so this tweaking of the list isn't expected to be a thing which
    keeps happening.

    x86/speculation: Update Speculation Control microcode blacklist
    
    commit 1751342095f0d2b36fa8114d8e12c5688c455ac4 upstream.
    
    Intel have retroactively blessed the 0xc2 microcode on Skylake mobile
    and desktop parts, and the Gemini Lake 0x22 microcode is apparently fine
    too. We blacklisted the latter purely because it was present with all
    the other problematic ones in the 2018-01-08 release, but now it's
    explicitly listed as OK.
    
    We still list 0x84 for the various Kaby Lake / Coffee Lake parts, as
    that appeared in one version of the blacklist and then reverted to
    0x80 again. We can change it if 0x84 is actually announced to be safe.

    powerpc/mm/radix: Split linear mapping on hot-unplug
    
    commit 4dd5f8a99e791a8c6500e3592f3ce81ae7edcde1 upstream.
    
    This patch splits the linear mapping if the hot-unplug range is
    smaller than the mapping size. The code detects if the mapping needs
    to be split into a smaller size and if so, uses the stop machine
    infrastructure to clear the existing mapping and then remap the
    remaining range using a smaller page size.
    
    The code will skip any region of the mapping that overlaps with kernel
    text and warn about it once. We don't want to remove a mapping where
    the kernel text and the LMB we intend to remove overlap in the same
    TLB mapping as it may affect the currently executing code.
    
    I've tested these changes under a kvm guest with 2 vcpus, from a split
    mapping point of view, some of the caveats mentioned above applied to
    the testing I did.

    x86/entry/64: Clear extra registers beyond syscall arguments, to reduce speculation attack surface
    
    commit 8e1eb3fa009aa7c0b944b3c8b26b07de0efb3200 upstream.
    
    At entry userspace may have (maliciously) populated the extra registers
    outside the syscall calling convention with arbitrary values that could
    be useful in a speculative execution (Spectre style) attack.
    
    Clear these registers to minimize the kernel's attack surface.
    
    Note, this only clears the extra registers and not the unused
    registers for syscalls less than 6 arguments, since those registers are
    likely to be clobbered well before their values could be put to use
    under speculation.
    
    Note, Linus found that the XOR instructions can be executed with
    minimized cost if interleaved with the PUSH instructions, and Ingo's
    analysis found that R10 and R11 should be included in the register
    clearing beyond the typical 'extra' syscall calling convention
    registers.

    x86/kexec: Make kexec (mostly) work in 5-level paging mode
    
    commit 5bf30316991d5bcda046343ee77d823cf16fdd03 upstream.
    
    Currently kexec() will crash when switching into a 5-level paging
    enabled kernel.
    
    I missed that we need to change relocate_kernel() to set CR4.LA57
    flag if the kernel has 5-level paging enabled.
    
    I avoided using #ifdef CONFIG_X86_5LEVEL here and inferred if we need to
    enable 5-level paging from previous CR4 value. This way the code is
    ready for boot-time switching between paging modes.
    
    With this patch applied, in addition to kexec 4-to-4 which always worked,
    we can kexec 4-to-5 and 5-to-5 - while 5-to-4 will need more work.

    CFL was missing from intel_early_ids[]. The PCI ID needs to be there to
    allow the memory region to be stolen, otherwise we could have RAM being
    arbitrarily overwritten if for example we keep using the UEFI framebuffer,
    depending on how BIOS has set up the e820 map.

    drm/i915: add GT number to intel_device_info
    
    commit 0890540e21cf1156b4cf960a4c1c734db4e816f9 upstream.
    
    Up to Coffeelake we could deduce this GT number from the device ID.
    This doesn't seem to be the case anymore. This change reorders pciids
    per GT and adds a gt field to intel_device_info. We set this field on
    the following platforms :
    
       - SNB/IVB/HSW/BDW/SKL/KBL/CFL/CNL
    
    Before & After :
    
    $ modinfo drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915.ko | grep ^alias | wc -l
    209
    
    v2: Add SNB & IVB (Chris)
    
    v3: Fix compilation error in early-quirks (Lionel)
    
    v4: Fix inconsistency between FEATURE/PLATFORM macros (Ville)

    The clcd device is lacking an interrupt-parent property, which makes

    I looked up the old board files and found that this interrupt has
    the same irqchip as all the other on-chip device, it just needs one
    extra line.

    ARM: lpc3250: fix uda1380 gpio numbers
    
    commit ca32e0c4bf9ca4b87089c5a5ce945e5f2ec890da upstream.
    
    dtc warns about obviously incorrect GPIO numbers for the audio codec
    on both lpc32xx boards:
    
    arch/arm/boot/dts/lpc3250-phy3250.dtb: Warning (gpios_property): reset-gpio property size (12) too small for cell size 3 in /ahb/apb/i2c@400A0000/uda1380@18

    It looks like the nodes are written for a different binding that combines
    the GPIO number into a single number rather than a bank/number pair.
    I found the right numbers on stackexchange.com, so this patch fixes
    the warning and has a reasonable chance of getting things to actually
    work.

    For some reason, the implementation of some 16-bit ID system calls

    instead of low2highgid/low2highuid macros for converting [GU]IDs, which

    invalid).

    powerpc: Fix DABR match on hash based systems
    
    commit f23ab3efb1b30cc5c5ef5ae4ef294ed467f30675 upstream.
    
    Commit 398a719d34a1 ("powerpc/mm: Update bits used to skip hash_page")
    mistakenly dropped the DSISR_DABRMATCH bit from the mask of bit tested
    to skip trying to hash a page.
    
    As a result, the DABR matches would no longer be detected.
    
    This adds it back. We open code it in the 2 places where it matters
    rather than fold it into DSISR_BAD_FAULT_32S/64S because this isn't
    technically a bad fault and while we would never hit it with the
    current code, I prefer if page_fault_is_bad() didn't trigger on these.

    The CPU event notification queues on sPAPR should be configured using
    a hardware CPU identifier.
    
    The problem did not show up on the Power Hypervisor because pHyp
    supports 8 threads per core which keeps CPU number contiguous. This is
    not the case on all sPAPR virtual machines, some use SMT=1.
    
    Also improve error logging by adding the CPU number.

    powerpc/mm: Flush radix process translations when setting MMU type
    
    commit 62e984ddfd6b056d399e24113f5e6a7145e579d8 upstream.
    
    Radix guests do normally invalidate process-scoped translations when a
    new pid is allocated but migrated guests do not invalidate these so
    migrated guests crash sometime, especially easy to reproduce with
    migration happening within first 10 seconds after the guest boot start
    on the same machine.
    
    This adds the "Invalidate process-scoped translations" flush to fix
    radix guests migration.

    powerpc/numa: Invalidate numa_cpu_lookup_table on cpu remove
    
    commit 1d9a090783bef19fe8cdec878620d22f05191316 upstream.
    
    When DLPAR removing a CPU, the unmapping of the cpu from a node in
    unmap_cpu_from_node() should also invalidate the CPUs entry in the
    numa_cpu_lookup_table. There is not a guarantee that on a subsequent
    DLPAR add of the CPU the associativity will be the same and thus
    could be in a different node. Invalidating the entry in the
    numa_cpu_lookup_table causes the associativity to be read from the
    device tree at the time of the add.
    
    The current behavior of not invalidating the CPUs entry in the
    numa_cpu_lookup_table can result in scenarios where the the topology
    layout of CPUs in the partition does not match the device tree
    or the topology reported by the HMC.
    
    This bug looks like it was introduced in 2004 in the commit titled
    "ppc64: cpu hotplug notifier for numa", which is 6b15e4e87e32 in the
    linux-fullhist tree. Hence tag it for all stable releases.

    ocfs2: try a blocking lock before return AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE
    
    commit ff26cc10aec128c3f86b5611fd5f59c71d49c0e3 upstream.
    
    If we can't get inode lock immediately in the function
    ocfs2_inode_lock_with_page() when reading a page, we should not return
    directly here, since this will lead to a softlockup problem when the
    kernel is configured with CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set.  The method is to
    get a blocking lock and immediately unlock before returning, this can
    avoid CPU resource waste due to lots of retries, and benefits fairness
    in getting lock among multiple nodes, increase efficiency in case
    modifying the same file frequently from multiple nodes.
    
    The softlockup crash (when set /proc/sys/kernel/softlockup_panic to 1)
    looks like:
    
      Kernel panic - not syncing: softlockup: hung tasks

    mwifiex: resolve reset vs. remove()/shutdown() deadlocks
    
    commit a64e7a79dd6030479caad603c8d78e6c9c14904f upstream.
    
    Commit b014e96d1abb ("PCI: Protect pci_error_handlers->reset_notify()
    usage with device_lock()") resolves races between driver reset and
    removal, but it introduces some new deadlock problems. If we see a
    timeout while we've already started suspending, removing, or shutting
    down the driver, we might see:
    
    (a) a worker thread, running mwifiex_pcie_work() ->
        mwifiex_pcie_card_reset_work() -> pci_reset_function()
    (b) a removal thread, running mwifiex_pcie_remove() ->
        mwifiex_free_adapter() -> mwifiex_unregister() ->
        mwifiex_cleanup_pcie() -> cancel_work_sync(&card->work)
    
    Unfortunately, mwifiex_pcie_remove() already holds the device lock that
    pci_reset_function() is now requesting, and so we see a deadlock.
    
    It's necessary to cancel and synchronize our outstanding work before
    tearing down the driver, so we can't have this work wait indefinitely
    for the lock.
    
    It's reasonable to only "try" to reset here, since this will mostly
    happen for cases where it's already difficult to reset the firmware
    anyway (e.g., while we're suspending or powering off the system). And if
    reset *really* needs to happen, we can always try again later.

    Propagate the error of devfreq_add_device() in devm_devfreq_add_device()
    rather than statically returning ENOMEM. This makes it slightly faster

    RDMA/rxe: Fix a race condition in rxe_requester()
    
    commit 65567e41219888feec72fee1de98ccf1efbbc16d upstream.
    
    The rxe driver works as follows:
    * The send queue, receive queue and completion queues are implemented as
      circular buffers.
    * ib_post_send() and ib_post_recv() calls are serialized through a spinlock.
    * Removing elements from various queues happens from tasklet
      context. Tasklets are guaranteed to run on at most one CPU. This serializes
      access to these queues. See also rxe_completer(), rxe_requester() and
      rxe_responder().
    * rxe_completer() processes the skbs queued onto qp->resp_pkts.
    * rxe_requester() handles the send queue (qp->sq.queue).
    * rxe_responder() processes the skbs queued onto qp->req_pkts.
    
    Since rxe_drain_req_pkts() processes qp->req_pkts, calling
    rxe_drain_req_pkts() from rxe_requester() is racy. Hence this patch.

    RDMA/rxe: Fix a race condition related to the QP error state
    
    commit 6f301e06de4cf9ab7303f5acd43e64fcd4aa04be upstream.
    
    The following sequence:
    * Change queue pair state into IB_QPS_ERR.
    * Post a work request on the queue pair.
    
    Triggers the following race condition in the rdma_rxe driver:
    * rxe_qp_error() triggers an asynchronous call of rxe_completer(), the function
      that examines the QP send queue.
    * rxe_post_send() posts a work request on the QP send queue.
    
    If rxe_completer() runs prior to rxe_post_send(), it will drain the send
    queue and the driver will assume no further action is necessary.
    However, once we post the send to the send queue, because the queue is
    in error, no send completion will ever happen and the send will get
    stuck.  In order to process the send, we need to make sure that
    rxe_completer() gets run after a send is posted to a queue pair in an
    error state.  This patch ensures that happens.

    kselftest: fix OOM in memory compaction test
    
    commit 4c1baad223906943b595a887305f2e8124821dad upstream.
    
    Running the compaction_test sometimes results in out-of-memory
    failures. When I debugged this, it turned out that the code to
    reset the number of hugepages to the initial value is simply
    broken since we write into an open sysctl file descriptor
    multiple times without seeking back to the start.
    
    Adding the lseek here fixes the problem.

    IB/core: Avoid a potential OOPs for an unused optional parameter
    
    commit 2ff124d597c2df8696169ce0006fc974c49a4569 upstream.
    
    The ev_file is an optional parameter for CQ creation. If the parameter
    is not passed, the ev_file pointer will be NULL.  Using that pointer
    to set the cq_context will result in an OOPs.
    
    Verify that ev_file is not NULL before using.

    IB/core: Fix ib_wc structure size to remain in 64 bytes boundary
    
    commit cd2a6e7d384b043d5d029e39663061cebc949385 upstream.
    
    The change of slid from u16 to u32 results in sizeof(struct ib_wc)
    cross 64B boundary, which causes more cache misses. This patch
    rearranges the fields and remain the size to 64B.

    IB/mlx4: Fix incorrectly releasing steerable UD QPs when have only ETH ports
    
    commit 852f6927594d0d3e8632c889b2ab38cbc46476ad upstream.
    
    Allocating steerable UD QPs depends on having at least one IB port,
    while releasing those QPs does not.
    
    As a result, when there are only ETH ports, the IB (RoCE) driver
    requests releasing a qp range whose base qp is zero, with
    qp count zero.
    
    When SR-IOV is enabled, and the VF driver is running on a VM over
    a hypervisor which treats such qp release calls as errors
    (rather than NOPs), we see lines in the VM message log like:
    
     mlx4_core 0002:00:02.0: Failed to release qp range base:0 cnt:0
    
    Fix this by adding a check for a zero count in mlx4_release_qp_range()
    (which thus treats releasing 0 qps as a nop), and eliminating the
    check for device managed flow steering when releasing steerable UD QPs.
    (Freeing ib_uc_qpns_bitmap unconditionally is also OK, since it
    remains NULL when steerable UD QPs are not allocated).

    IB/umad: Fix use of unprotected device pointer
    
    commit f23a5350e43c810ca36b26d4ed4ecd9a08686f47 upstream.
    
    The ib_write_umad() is protected by taking the umad file mutex.
    However, it accesses file->port->ib_dev -- which is protected only by the
    port's mutex (field file_mutex).
    
    The ib_umad_remove_one() calls ib_umad_kill_port() which sets
    port->ib_dev to NULL under the port mutex (NOT the file mutex).
    It then sets the mad agent to "dead" under the umad file mutex.
    
    This is a race condition -- because there is a window where
    port->ib_dev is NULL, while the agent is not "dead".
    
    As a result, we saw stack traces like:

    In the above trace, ib_umad_write is trying to dereference the NULL
    file->port->ib_dev pointer.
    
    Fix this by using the agent's device pointer (the device field
    in struct ib_mad_agent) -- which IS protected by the umad file mutex.

    tracing: Prevent PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES when FORTIFY_SOURCE=y
    
    commit 68e76e034b6b1c1ce2eece1ab8ae4008e14be470 upstream.
    
    I regularly get 50 MB - 60 MB files during kernel randconfig builds.
    These large files mostly contain (many repeats of; e.g., 124,594):
    
    In file included from ../include/linux/string.h:6:0,
                     from ../include/linux/uuid.h:20,
                     from ../include/linux/mod_devicetable.h:13,
                     from ../scripts/mod/devicetable-offsets.c:3:
    ../include/linux/compiler.h:64:4: warning: '______f' is static but declared in inline function 'strcpy' which is not static [enabled by default]
        ______f = {     \
        ^
    ../include/linux/compiler.h:56:23: note: in expansion of macro '__trace_if'
                           ^
    ../include/linux/string.h:425:2: note: in expansion of macro 'if'
      if (p_size == (size_t)-1 && q_size == (size_t)-1)
      ^
    
    This only happens when CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE=y and
    CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES=y, so prevent PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES if
    FORTIFY_SOURCE=y.
