    futex: Forbid uaddr == uaddr2 in futex_wait_requeue_pi()
    
    commit 6f7b0a2a5c0fb03be7c25bd1745baa50582348ef upstream.
    
    If uaddr == uaddr2, then we have broken the rule of only requeueing
    from a non-pi futex to a pi futex with this call. If we attempt this,
    as the trinity test suite manages to do, we miss early wakeups as
    q.key is equal to key2 (because they are the same uaddr). We will then
    attempt to dereference the pi_mutex (which would exist had the futex_q
    been properly requeued to a pi futex) and trigger a NULL pointer
    dereference.

    futex: Fix bug in WARN_ON for NULL q.pi_state
    
    commit f27071cb7fe3e1d37a9dbe6c0dfc5395cd40fa43 upstream.
    
    The WARN_ON in futex_wait_requeue_pi() for a NULL q.pi_state was testing
    the address (&q.pi_state) of the pointer instead of the value
    (q.pi_state) of the pointer. Correct it accordingly.

    ALSA: hda - Fix mute-LED GPIO initialization for IDT codecs
    
    commit 1f43f6c1bc8d740e75b4177eb29110858bb5fea2 upstream.
    
    The IDT codecs initializes the GPIO setup for mute LEDs via
    snd_hda_sync_vmaster_hook().  This works in most cases except for the
    very first call, which is called before PCM and control creations.
    Thus before Master switch is set manually via alsactl, the mute LED
    may show the wrong state, depending on the polarity.
    
    Now it's fixed by calling the LED-status update function manually when
    no vmaster is set yet.

    commit a3e199732b8e2b272e82cc1ccc49c35239ed6c5a upstream.
    
    BIOS on HP Mini 210 doesn't provide the proper "HP_Mute_LED" DMI
    string, thus the driver doesn't initialize the GPIO, too.  In the
    earlier kernel, the driver falls back to GPIO1, but since 3.3 we've
    stopped this due to other wrongly advertised machines.
    
    For fixing this particular case, add a new model type to specify the
    default polarity explicitly so that the fallback to GPIO1 is handled.

    ALSA: hda - Fix invalid D3 of headphone DAC on VT202x codecs
    
    commit 6162552b0de6ba80937c3dd53e084967851cd199 upstream.
    
    We've got a bug report about the silent output from the headphone on a
    mobo with VT2021, and spotted out that this was because of the wrong
    D3 state on the DAC for the headphone output.  The bug is triggered by
    the incomplete check for this DAC in set_widgets_power_state_vt1718S().
    It checks only the connectivity of the primary output (0x27) but
    doesn't consider the path from the headphone pin (0x28).
    
    Now this patch fixes the problem by checking both pins for DAC 0x0b.

    tcp: perform DMA to userspace only if there is a task waiting for it
    
    [ Upstream commit 59ea33a68a9083ac98515e4861c00e71efdc49a1 ]
    
    Back in 2006, commit 1a2449a87b ("[I/OAT]: TCP recv offload to I/OAT")
    added support for receive offloading to IOAT dma engine if available.
    
    The code in tcp_rcv_established() tries to perform early DMA copy if
    applicable. It however does so without checking whether the userspace
    task is actually expecting the data in the buffer.
    
    This is not a problem under normal circumstances, but there is a corner
    case where this doesn't work -- and that's when MSG_TRUNC flag to
    recvmsg() is used.
    
    If the IOAT dma engine is not used, the code properly checks whether
    there is a valid ucopy.task and the socket is owned by userspace, but
    misses the check in the dmaengine case.
    
    This problem can be observed in real trivially -- for example 'tbench' is a
    good reproducer, as it makes a heavy use of MSG_TRUNC. On systems utilizing
    IOAT, you will soon find tbench waiting indefinitely in sk_wait_data(), as they
    have been already early-copied in tcp_rcv_established() using dma engine.
    
    This patch introduces the same check we are performing in the simple
    iovec copy case to the IOAT case as well. It fixes the indefinite
    recvmsg(MSG_TRUNC) hangs.

    net: fix rtnetlink IFF_PROMISC and IFF_ALLMULTI handling
    
    [ Upstream commit b1beb681cba5358f62e6187340660ade226a5fcc ]
    
    When device flags are set using rtnetlink, IFF_PROMISC and IFF_ALLMULTI
    flags are handled specially. Function dev_change_flags sets IFF_PROMISC and
    IFF_ALLMULTI bits in dev->gflags according to the passed value but
    do_setlink passes a result of rtnl_dev_combine_flags which takes those bits
    from dev->flags.
    
    This can be easily trigerred by doing:
    
    tcpdump -i eth0 &
    ip l s up eth0
    
    ip sets IFF_UP flag in ifi_flags and ifi_change, which is combined with
    IFF_PROMISC by rtnl_dev_combine_flags, causing __dev_change_flags to set
    IFF_PROMISC in gflags.

    net: Fix references to out-of-scope variables in put_cmsg_compat()
    
    [ Upstream commit 818810472b129004c16fc51bf0a570b60776bfb7 ]
    
    In net/compat.c::put_cmsg_compat() we may assign 'data' the address of
    either the 'ctv' or 'cts' local variables inside the 'if
    (!COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME)' branch.
    
    Those variables go out of scope at the end of the 'if' statement, so
    when we use 'data' further down in 'copy_to_user(CMSG_COMPAT_DATA(cm),
    data, cmlen - sizeof(struct compat_cmsghdr))' there's no telling what
    it may be refering to - not good.
    
    Fix the problem by simply giving 'ctv' and 'cts' function scope.

    ext4: use s_csum_seed instead of i_csum_seed for xattr block
    
    commit 41eb70dde42b2360074a559a6f1fc49860a50179 upstream.
    
    In xattr block operation, we use h_refcount to indicate whether the
    xattr block is shared among many inodes. And xattr block csum uses
    s_csum_seed if it is shared and i_csum_seed if it belongs to
    one inode. But this has a problem. So consider the block is shared
    first bewteen inode A and B, and B has some xattr update and CoW
    the xattr block. When it updates the *old* xattr block(because
    of the h_refcount change) and calls ext4_xattr_release_block, we
    has no idea that inode A is the real owner of the *old* xattr
    block and we can't use the i_csum_seed of inode A either in xattr
    block csum calculation. And I don't think we have an easy way to
    find inode A.
    
    So this patch just removes the tricky i_csum_seed and we now uses
    s_csum_seed every time for the xattr block csum. The corresponding
    patch for the e2fsprogs will be sent in another patch.
    
    This is spotted by xfstests 117.

    ext4: use proper csum calculation in ext4_rename
    
    commit ef58f69c3c34f6377f1e21d3533c806dbd980ad0 upstream.
    
    In ext4_rename, when the old name is a dir, we need to
    change ".." to its new parent and journal the change, so
    with metadata_csum enabled, we have to re-calc the csum.
    
    As the first block of the dir can be either a htree root
    or a normal directory block and we have different csum
    calculation for these 2 types, we have to choose the right
    one in ext4_rename.
    
    btw, it is found by xfstests 013.

    ext4: undo ext4_calc_metadata_amount if we fail to claim space
    
    commit 03179fe92318e7934c180d96f12eff2cb36ef7b6 upstream.
    
    The function ext4_calc_metadata_amount() has side effects, although
    it's not obvious from its function name.  So if we fail to claim
    space, regardless of whether we retry to claim the space again, or
    return an error, we need to undo these side effects.
    
    Otherwise we can end up incorrectly calculating the number of metadata
    blocks needed for the operation, which was responsible for an xfstests
    failure for test #271 when using an ext2 file system with delalloc
    enabled.

    ext4: don't let i_reserved_meta_blocks go negative
    
    commit 97795d2a5b8d3c8dc4365d4bd3404191840453ba upstream.
    
    If we hit a condition where we have allocated metadata blocks that
    were not appropriately reserved, we risk underflow of
    ei->i_reserved_meta_blocks.  In turn, this can throw
    sbi->s_dirtyclusters_counter significantly out of whack and undermine
    the nondelalloc fallback logic in ext4_nonda_switch().  Warn if this
    occurs and set i_allocated_meta_blocks to avoid this problem.
    
    This condition is reproduced by xfstests 270 against ext2 with
    delalloc enabled:
    
    Mar 28 08:58:02 localhost kernel: [  171.526344] EXT4-fs (loop1): delayed block allocation failed for inode 14 at logical offset 64486 with max blocks 64 with error -28
    Mar 28 08:58:02 localhost kernel: [  171.526346] EXT4-fs (loop1): This should not happen!! Data will be lost
    
    270 ultimately fails with an inconsistent filesystem and requires an
    fsck to repair.  The cause of the error is an underflow in
    ext4_da_update_reserve_space() due to an unreserved meta block
    allocation.

    ext4: fix hole punch failure when depth is greater than 0
    
    commit 968dee77220768a5f52cf8b21d0bdb73486febef upstream.
    
    Whether to continue removing extents or not is decided by the return
    value of function ext4_ext_more_to_rm() which checks 2 conditions:
    a) if there are no more indexes to process.
    b) if the number of entries are decreased in the header of "depth -1".
    
    In case of hole punch, if the last block to be removed is not part of
    the last extent index than this index will not be deleted, hence the
    number of valid entries in the extent header of "depth - 1" will
    remain as it is and ext4_ext_more_to_rm will return 0 although the
    required blocks are not yet removed.
    
    This patch fixes the above mentioned problem as instead of removing
    the extents from the end of file, it starts removing the blocks from
    the particular extent from which removing blocks is actually required
    and continue backward until done.

    ext4: fix overhead calculation used by ext4_statfs()
    
    commit 952fc18ef9ec707ebdc16c0786ec360295e5ff15 upstream.
    
    Commit f975d6bcc7a introduced bug which caused ext4_statfs() to
    miscalculate the number of file system overhead blocks.  This causes
    the f_blocks field in the statfs structure to be larger than it should
    be.  This would in turn cause the "df" output to show the number of
    data blocks in the file system and the number of data blocks used to
    be larger than they should be.

    nouveau: Fix alignment requirements on src and dst addresses
    
    commit ce806a30470bcd846d148bf39d46de3ad7748228 upstream.
    
    Linear copy works by adding the offset to the buffer address,
    which may end up not being 16-byte aligned.
    
    Some tests I've written for prime_pcopy show that the engine
    allows this correctly, so the restriction on lowest 4 bits of
    address can be lifted safely.
    
    The comments added were by envyas, I think because I used

    NFS: Fix a number of bugs in the idmapper
    
    commit a427b9ec4eda8cd6e641ea24541d30b641fc3140 upstream.
    
    Fix a number of bugs in the NFS idmapper code:
    
     (1) Only registered key types can be passed to the core keys code, so
         register the legacy idmapper key type.
    
         This is a requirement because the unregister function cleans up keys
         belonging to that key type so that there aren't dangling pointers to the
         module left behind - including the key->type pointer.
    
     (2) Rename the legacy key type.  You can't have two key types with the same
         name, and (1) would otherwise require that.
    
     (3) complete_request_key() must be called in the error path of
         nfs_idmap_legacy_upcall().
    
     (4) There is one idmap struct for each nfs_client struct.  This means that
         idmap->idmap_key_cons is shared without the use of a lock.  This is a
         problem because key_instantiate_and_link() - as called indirectly by
         idmap_pipe_downcall() - releases anyone waiting for the key to be
         instantiated.
    
         What happens is that idmap_pipe_downcall() running in the rpc.idmapd
         thread, releases the NFS filesystem in whatever thread that is running in
         to continue.  This may then make another idmapper call, overwriting
         idmap_key_cons before idmap_pipe_downcall() gets the chance to call
         complete_request_key().
    
         I *think* that reading idmap_key_cons only once, before
         key_instantiate_and_link() is called, and then caching the result in a
         variable is sufficient.
    
    Bug (4) is the cause of:
    
    BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at           (null)

    rpciod is trying to allocate memory for a new socket to talk to the
    server. The VM ends up calling ->releasepage to get more memory, and it
    tries to do a blocking commit. That commit can't succeed however without
    a connected socket, so we deadlock.
    
    Fix this by setting PF_FSTRANS on the workqueue task prior to doing the
    socket allocation, and having nfs_release_page check for that flag when
    deciding whether to do a commit call. Also, set PF_FSTRANS
    unconditionally in rpc_async_schedule since that function can also do
    allocations sometimes.

    posix_types.h: Cleanup stale __NFDBITS and related definitions
    
    commit 8ded2bbc1845e19c771eb55209aab166ef011243 upstream.
    
    Recently, glibc made a change to suppress sign-conversion warnings in
    FD_SET (glibc commit ceb9e56b3d1).  This uncovered an issue with the
    kernel's definition of __NFDBITS if applications #include
    <linux/types.h> after including <sys/select.h>.  A build failure would
    be seen when passing the -Werror=sign-compare and -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2
    flags to gcc.
    
    It was suggested that the kernel should either match the glibc
    definition of __NFDBITS or remove that entirely.  The current in-kernel
    uses of __NFDBITS can be replaced with BITS_PER_LONG, and there are no
    uses of the related __FDELT and __FDMASK defines.  Given that, we'll
    continue the cleanup that was started with commit 8b3d1cda4f5f
    ("posix_types: Remove fd_set macros") and drop the remaining unused
    macros.
    
    Additionally, linux/time.h has similar macros defined that expand to
    nothing so we'll remove those at the same time.

    drm/radeon: on hotplug force link training to happen (v2)
    
    commit ca2ccde5e2f24a792caa4cca919fc5c6f65d1887 upstream.
    
    To have DP behave like VGA/DVI we need to retrain the link
    on hotplug. For this to happen we need to force link
    training to happen by setting connector dpms to off
    before asking it turning it on again.
    
    v2: agd5f
    - drop the dp_get_link_status() change in atombios_dp.c
      for now.  We still need the dpms OFF change.

    drm/radeon: Try harder to avoid HW cursor ending on a multiple of 128 columns.
    
    commit f60ec4c7df043df81e62891ac45383d012afe0da upstream.
    
    This could previously fail if either of the enabled displays was using a
    horizontal resolution that is a multiple of 128, and only the leftmost column
    of the cursor was (supposed to be) visible at the right edge of that display.
    
    The solution is to move the cursor one pixel to the left in that case.

    commit 764a1b1acecedfe204cb2e80d8e2cc7c6df1b0b8 upstream.
    
    The readpages bug is a regression that was introduced in 6993f74a5.
    This also fixes a couple of similar bugs in the uncached read and write
    codepaths.
    
    Also, prevent this sort of thing in the future by having cifsFileInfo_get
    take the spinlock itself, and adding a _locked variant for use in places
    that are already holding the lock. The _put code has always done that
    so this makes for a less confusing interface.

    commit e9fbcb42201c862fd6ab45c48ead4f47bb2dea9d upstream.
    
    Each ordered operation has a free callback, and this was called with the

    which we can't do with the spinlock.
    
    This drops the spinlock for the free operation and grabs it again before

    ACPI/AC: prevent OOPS on some boxes due to missing check power_supply_register() return value check
    
    commit f197ac13f6eeb351b31250b9ab7d0da17434ea36 upstream.
    
    In the ac.c, power_supply_register()'s return value is not checked.
    
    As a result, the driver's add() ops may return success
    even though the device failed to initialize.
    
    For example, some BIOS may describe two ACADs in the same DSDT.
    The second ACAD device will fail to register,
    but ACPI driver's add() ops returns sucessfully.
    The ACPI device will receive ACPI notification and cause OOPS.

    ACPI, APEI: Fixup common access width firmware bug
    
    commit f712c71f7b2b43b894d1e92e1b77385fcad8815f upstream.
    
    Many firmwares have a common register definition bug where 8-bit
    access width is specified for a 32-bit register. Ideally this should

    workqueue: perform cpu down operations from low priority cpu_notifier()
    
    commit 6575820221f7a4dd6eadecf7bf83cdd154335eda upstream.
    
    Currently, all workqueue cpu hotplug operations run off
    CPU_PRI_WORKQUEUE which is higher than normal notifiers.  This is to
    ensure that workqueue is up and running while bringing up a CPU before
    other notifiers try to use workqueue on the CPU.
    
    Per-cpu workqueues are supposed to remain working and bound to the CPU
    for normal CPU_DOWN_PREPARE notifiers.  This holds mostly true even
    with workqueue offlining running with higher priority because
    workqueue CPU_DOWN_PREPARE only creates a bound trustee thread which
    runs the per-cpu workqueue without concurrency management without
    explicitly detaching the existing workers.
    
    However, if the trustee needs to create new workers, it creates
    unbound workers which may wander off to other CPUs while
    CPU_DOWN_PREPARE notifiers are in progress.  Furthermore, if the CPU
    down is cancelled, the per-CPU workqueue may end up with workers which
    aren't bound to the CPU.
    
    While reliably reproducible with a convoluted artificial test-case
    involving scheduling and flushing CPU burning work items from CPU down
    notifiers, this isn't very likely to happen in the wild, and, even
    when it happens, the effects are likely to be hidden by the following
    successful CPU down.
    
    Fix it by using different priorities for up and down notifiers - high
    priority for up operations and low priority for down operations.
    
    Workqueue cpu hotplug operations will soon go through further cleanup.

    staging: zsmalloc: Finish conversion to a separate module
    
    commit 069f101fa463351f528773d73b74e9b606b3f66a upstream.
    
    ZSMALLOC is tristate, but the code has no MODULE_LICENSE and since it
    depends on GPL-only symbols it cannot be loaded as a module.  This in
    turn breaks zram which now depends on it.  I assume it's meant to be
    Dual BSD/GPL like the other z-stuff.
    
    There is also no module_exit, which will make it impossible to unload.
    Add the appropriate module_init and module_exit declarations suggested
    by comments.

    udf: Improve table length check to avoid possible overflow

    When a partition table length is corrupted to be close to 1 << 32, the
    check for its length may overflow on 32-bit systems and we will think
    the length is valid. Later on the kernel can crash trying to read beyond

    s390/mm: fix fault handling for page table walk case
    
    commit 008c2e8f247f0a8db1e8e26139da12f3a3abcda0 upstream.
    
    Make sure the kernel does not incorrectly create a SIGBUS signal during
    user space accesses:
    
    For user space accesses in the switched addressing mode case the kernel
    may walk page tables and access user address space via the kernel
    mapping. If a page table entry is invalid the function __handle_fault()
    gets called in order to emulate a page fault and trigger all the usual
    actions like paging in a missing page etc. by calling handle_mm_fault().
    
    If handle_mm_fault() returns with an error fixup handling is necessary.
    For the switched addressing mode case all errors need to be mapped to
    -EFAULT, so that the calling uaccess function can return -EFAULT to
    user space.
    
    Unfortunately the __handle_fault() incorrectly calls do_sigbus() if
    VM_FAULT_SIGBUS is set. This however should only happen if a page fault
    was triggered by a user space instruction. For kernel mode uaccesses
    the correct action is to only return -EFAULT.
    So user space may incorrectly see SIGBUS signals because of this bug.
    
    For current machines this would only be possible for the switched
    addressing mode case in conjunction with futex operations.

    The downgrade of the 4 level page table created by init_new_context is
    currently done only in start_thread31. If a 31 bit process forks the
    new mm uses a 4 level page table, including the task size of 2<<42
    that goes along with it. This is incorrect as now a 31 bit process
    can map memory beyond 2GB. Define arch_dup_mmap to do the downgrade
    after fork.

    s390/idle: fix sequence handling vs cpu hotplug
    
    commit 0008204ffe85d23382d6fd0f971f3f0fbe70bae2 upstream.
    
    The s390 idle accounting code uses a sequence counter which gets used
    when the per cpu idle statistics get updated and read.
    
    One assumption on read access is that only when the sequence counter is
    even and did not change while reading all values the result is valid.
    On cpu hotplug however the per cpu data structure gets initialized via
    a cpu hotplug notifier on CPU_ONLINE.
    CPU_ONLINE however is too late, since the onlined cpu is already running
    and might access the per cpu data. Worst case is that the data structure
    gets initialized while an idle thread is updating its idle statistics.
    This will result in an uneven sequence counter after an update.
    
    As a result user space tools like top, which access /proc/stat in order
    to get idle stats, will busy loop waiting for the sequence counter to
    become even again, which will never happen until the queried cpu will
    update its idle statistics again. And even then the sequence counter
    will only have an even value for a couple of cpu cycles.
    
    Fix this by moving the initialization of the per cpu idle statistics
    to cpu_init(). I prefer that solution in favor of changing the
    notifier to CPU_UP_PREPARE, which would be a different solution to
    the problem.

    rtlwifi: rtl8192de: Fix phy-based version calculation
    
    commit f1b00f4dab29b57bdf1bc03ef12020b280fd2a72 upstream.
    
    Commit d83579e2a50ac68389e6b4c58b845c702cf37516 incorporated some
    changes from the vendor driver that made it newly important that the
    calculated hardware version correctly include the CHIP_92D bit, as all
    of the IS_92D_* macros were changed to depend on it.  However, this bit
    was being unset for dual-mac, dual-phy devices.  The vendor driver
    behavior was modified to not do this, but unfortunately this change was
    not picked up along with the others.  This caused scanning in the 2.4GHz
    band to be broken, and possibly other bugs as well.
    
    This patch brings the version calculation logic in parity with the
    vendor driver in this regard, and in doing so fixes the regression.
    However, the version calculation code in general continues to be largely
    incoherent and messy, and needs to be cleaned up.

    rtlwifi: rtl8192cu: Change buffer allocation for synchronous reads
    
    commit 3ce4d85b76010525adedcc2555fa164bf706a2f3 upstream.
    
    In commit a7959c1, the USB part of rtlwifi was switched to convert
    _usb_read_sync() to using a preallocated buffer rather than one
    that has been acquired using kmalloc. Although this routine is named
    as though it were synchronous, there seem to be simultaneous users,
    and the selection of the index to the data buffer is not multi-user
    safe. This situation is addressed by adding a new spinlock. The routine
    cannot sleep, thus a mutex is not allowed.

    introduced by commit 1ab5ecb90cb6a3df1476e052f76a6e8f6511cb3d
    
    The problem is that this socket is embedded in struct tun_struct, it has
    no inode, iput is called on invalid inode, which modifies invalid memory
    and optionally causes a crash.
    
    sock_release also decrements sockets_in_use, this causes a bug that
    "sockets: used" field in /proc/*/net/sockstat keeps on decreasing when
    creating and closing tun devices.
    
    This patch introduces a flag SOCK_EXTERNALLY_ALLOCATED that instructs
    sock_release to not free the inode and not decrement sockets_in_use,
    fixing both memory corruption and sockets_in_use underflow.
    
    It should be backported to 3.3 an 3.4 stabke.

    TPM: chip disabled state erronously being reported as error
    
    commit 24ebe6670de3d1f0dca11c9eb372134c7ab05503 upstream.
    
    tpm_do_selftest() attempts to read a PCR in order to
    decide if one can rely on the TPM being used or not.
    The function that's used by __tpm_pcr_read() does not
    expect the TPM to be disabled or deactivated, and if so,
    reports an error.
    
    It's fine if the TPM returns this error when trying to
    use it for the first time after a power cycle, but it's
    definitely not if it already returned success for a
    previous attempt to read one of its PCRs.
    
    The tpm_do_selftest() was modified so that the driver only
    reports this return code as an error when it really is.

    ftrace: Disable function tracing during suspend/resume and hibernation, again
    
    commit 443772d408a25af62498793f6f805ce3c559309a upstream.
    
    If function tracing is enabled for some of the low-level suspend/resume
    functions, it leads to triple fault during resume from suspend, ultimately
    ending up in a reboot instead of a resume (or a total refusal to come out
    of suspended state, on some machines).
    
    This issue was explained in more detail in commit f42ac38c59e0a03d (ftrace:
    disable tracing for suspend to ram). However, the changes made by that commit
    got reverted by commit cbe2f5a6e84eebb (tracing: allow tracing of
    suspend/resume & hibernation code again). So, unfortunately since things are
    not yet robust enough to allow tracing of low-level suspend/resume functions,
    suspend/resume is still broken when ftrace is enabled.
    
    So fix this by disabling function tracing during suspend/resume & hibernation.

    In commit dad1743e5993f1 ("x86/mce: Only restart instruction after machine

    get told the virtual address of the fault via siginfo_t->si_addr. This
    would prevent application level recovery from the fault.
    
    Make a new MF_MUST_KILL flag bit for memory_failure() et al. to use so
    that we will provide the right information with the signal.

    x86, microcode: Sanitize per-cpu microcode reloading interface
    
    commit c9fc3f778a6a215ace14ee556067c73982b6d40f upstream.
    
    Microcode reloading in a per-core manner is a very bad idea for both
    major x86 vendors. And the thing is, we have such interface with which
    we can end up with different microcode versions applied on different
    cores of an otherwise homogeneous wrt (family,model,stepping) system.
    
    So turn off the possibility of doing that per core and allow it only
    system-wide.
    
    This is a minimal fix which we'd like to see in stable too thus the
    more-or-less arbitrary decision to allow system-wide reloading only on
    the BSP:
    
    $ echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/microcode/reload
    ...
    
    and disable the interface on the other cores:
    
    $ echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu23/microcode/reload
    -bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
    
    Also, allowing the reload only from one CPU (the BSP in
    that case) doesn't allow the reload procedure to degenerate
    into an O(n^2) deal when triggering reloads from all
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/microcode/reload sysfs nodes
    simultaneously.
    
    A more generic fix will follow.

    USB: Fix LPM disable count mismatch on driver unbind.
    
    commit 249719121bc2b841bdfcab5eb21b10d8b871743b upstream.
    
    When a user runs `echo 0 > bConfigurationValue` for a USB 3.0 device,
    usb_disable_device() is called.  This function disables all drivers,
    deallocates interfaces, and sets the device configuration value to 0
    (unconfigured).
    
    With the new scheme to ensure that unconfigured devices have LPM
    disabled, usb_disable_device() must call usb_unlocked_disable_lpm() once
    it unconfigures the device.

    USB: Fix LPM disable/enable during device reset.
    
    commit 6d1d051330ee096f575523647fbd8ffe703600b5 upstream.
    
    The USB 3.0 specification says that sending a Set Feature or Clear
    Feature for U1/U2 Enable is not a valid request when the device is in
    the Default or Addressed state.  It is only valid when the device is in
    the Configured state.
    
    The original LPM patch attempted to disable LPM after the device had
    been reset by hub_port_init(), before it had the configuration
    reinstalled.  The TI hub I tested with did not fail the Clear Feature
    U1/U2 Enable request that khubd sent while it was in the addressed
    state, which is why I didn't catch it.
    
    Move the LPM disable before the device reset, so that we can send the
    Clear Feature U1/U2 Enable successfully, and balance the LPM disable
    count.
    
    Also delete any calls to usb_enable_lpm() on error paths that lead to
    re-enumeration.  The calls will fail because the device isn't
    configured, and it's not useful to balance the LPM disable count because
    the usb_device is about to be destroyed before re-enumeration.
    
    Fix the early exit path ("done" label) to call usb_enable_lpm() to
    balance the LPM disable count.
    
    Note that calling usb_reset_and_verify_device() with an unconfigured
    device may fail on the first call to usb_disable_lpm().  That's because
    the LPM disable count is initialized to 0 (LPM enabled), and
    usb_disable_lpm() will attempt to send a Clear Feature U1/U2 request to
    a device in the Addressed state.  The next patch will fix that.
    
    This commit should be backported to kernels as old as 3.5, that contain

    USB: Disable LPM while the device is unconfigured.
    
    commit 9cf65991dd93ac3d5f97f536171c388918b7c1a9 upstream.
    
    The USB 3.0 Set/Clear Feature U1/U2 Enable cannot be sent to a device in
    the Default or Addressed state.  It can only be sent to a configured
    device.  Change the USB core to initialize the LPM disable count to 1
    (disabled), which reflects this limitation.
    
    Change usb_set_configuration() to ensure that if the device is
    unconfigured on entry, usb_lpm_disable() is not called.  This avoids
    sending the Clear Feature U1/U2 when the device is in the Addressed
    state.  When usb_set_configuration() exits with a successfully installed
    configuration, usb_lpm_enable() will be called.
    
    Once the new configuration is installed, make sure
    usb_set_configuration() only calls usb_enable_lpm() if the device moved
    to the Configured state.  If we have unconfigured the device by sending
    it a Set Configuration for config 0, don't enable LPM.

    Revert "usb/uas: make sure data urb is gone if we receive status before that"
    
    commit c621a81edecdee85da32c566c21836332c764fda upstream.
    
    This reverts commit e4d8318a85779b25b880187b1b1c44e797bd7d4b.
    
    This patch makes uas.c call usb_unlink_urb on data urbs.  The data urbs
    get freed in the completion callback.  This is illegal according to the
    usb_unlink_urb documentation.
    
    This patch also makes the code expect the data completion callback
    being called before the status completion callback.  This isn't
    guaranteed to be the case, even though the actual data transfer should
    be finished by the time the status is received.
    
    Background:  The ehci irq handler for example only know that there are
    finished transfers, it then has go check the QHs & TDs to see which
    transfers did actually finish.  It has no way to figure in which order
    the transfers did complete.  The xhci driver can call the callbacks in
    completion order thanks to the event queue.  This does nicely explain
    why the driver is solid on a (usb2) xhci port whereas it goes crazy on
    ehci in my testing.

    usb: gadget: Fix g_ether interface link status
    
    commit 31bde1ceaa873bcaecd49e829bfabceacc4c512d upstream.
    
    A "usb0" interface that has never been connected to a host has an unknown
    operstate, and therefore the IFF_RUNNING flag is (incorrectly) asserted
    when queried by ifconfig, ifplugd, etc.  This is a result of calling
    netif_carrier_off() too early in the probe function; it should be called
    after register_netdev().
    
    Similar problems have been fixed in many other drivers, e.g.:
    
        e826eafa6 (bonding: Call netif_carrier_off after register_netdevice)
        0d672e9f8 (drivers/net: Call netif_carrier_off at the end of the probe)
        6a3c869a6 (cxgb4: fix reported state of interfaces without link)
    
    Fix is to move netif_carrier_off() to the end of the function.

    Zytronic panels shows a new way of setting the Input Mode feature.
    This feature is put in the second usage in the HID feature, instead
    of the first, as the majority of the multitouch devices.
    
    This patch adds a detection step when the feature is presented to know
    where the feature is located in the report. We can then trigger the right
    command to the device. This removes the magic number "0" in the function
    mt_set_input_mode.

    commit b43d224767e426cf1a8b6622d1d172f2b2b0e857 upstream.
    
    After cancel_delayed_work_sync returns, the power down work either never
    started (power_on == 1) or finished (power_on == 0).  In the former case
    there is no need to power up again.

    ALSA: hda - Turn on PIN_OUT from hdmi playback prepare.
    
    commit 9e76e6d031482194a5b24d8e9ab88063fbd6b4b5 upstream.
    
    Turn on the pin widget's PIN_OUT bit from playback prepare. The pin is
    enabled in open, but is disabled in hdmi_init_pin which is called during
    system resume.  This causes a system suspend/resume during playback to
    mute HDMI/DP. Enabling the pin in prepare instead of open allows calling
    snd_pcm_prepare after a system resume to restore audio.

    Ever since the DAPM performance improvements we've been marking all widgets
    as not dirty after each DAPM run. Since _PRE and _POST events aren't part
    of the DAPM graph this has rendered them non-functional, they will never be
    marked dirty again and thus will never be run again.
    
    Fix this by skipping them when marking widgets as not dirty.

    commit 01ad8063a5db9ac8320f197577a34b423ba64eca upstream.
    
    On TrimSlice, Tegra's USB1 port may be routed to either an external micro
    USB port, or an internal USB->SATA bridge for SSD or HDD. This muxing is
    controlled by a GPIO. Whilst not strictly a VBUS GPIO, the TrimSlice
    board files caused this GPIO to be set appropriately to enable the SATA
    bridge by passing it as the VBUS GPIO to the USB driver. Echo this same
    configuration in device tree to enable the SATA bridge.
    
    An alternative might be to implement a full USB bus mux driver. However,
    that seems over-complex right now.

    ARM: OMAP2+: OPP: Fix to ensure check of right oppdef after bad one
    
    commit b110547e586eb5825bc1d04aa9147bff83b57672 upstream.
    
    Commit 9fa2df6b90786301b175e264f5fa9846aba81a65
    (ARM: OMAP2+: OPP: allow OPP enumeration to continue if device is not present)
    makes the logic:
    for (i = 0; i < opp_def_size; i++) {
            <snip>
            if (!oh || !oh->od) {
                    <snip>
                    continue;
            }
    <snip>
    opp_def++;
    }
    
    In short, the moment we hit a "Bad OPP", we end up looping the list
    comparing against the bad opp definition pointer for the rest of the
    iteration count. Instead, increment opp_def in the for loop itself
    and allow continue to be used in code without much thought so that
    we check the next set of OPP definition pointers :)

    When we call scsi_unprep_request() the command associated with the request
    gets destroyed and therefore drops its reference on the device.  If this was
    the only reference, the device may get released and we end up with a NULL
    pointer deref when we call blk_requeue_request.

    SCSI: Fix device removal NULL pointer dereference
    
    commit 67bd94130015c507011af37858989b199c52e1de upstream.
    
    Use blk_queue_dead() to test whether the queue is dead instead
    of !sdev. Since scsi_prep_fn() may be invoked concurrently with
    __scsi_remove_device(), keep the queuedata (sdev) pointer in
    __scsi_remove_device(). This patch fixes a kernel oops that
    can be triggered by USB device removal. See also
    http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg56254.html.
    
    Other changes included in this patch:
    - Swap the blk_cleanup_queue() and kfree() calls in
      scsi_host_dev_release() to make that code easier to grasp.
    - Remove the queue dead check from scsi_run_queue() since the
      queue state can change anyway at any point in that function
      where the queue lock is not held.
    - Remove the queue dead check from the start of scsi_request_fn()
      since it is redundant with the scsi_device_online() check.

    SCSI: fix eh wakeup (scsi_schedule_eh vs scsi_restart_operations)
    
    commit 57fc2e335fd3c2f898ee73570dc81426c28dc7b4 upstream.
    
    Rapid ata hotplug on a libsas controller results in cases where libsas
    is waiting indefinitely on eh to perform an ata probe.
    
    A race exists between scsi_schedule_eh() and scsi_restart_operations()
    in the case when scsi_restart_operations() issues i/o to other devices
    in the sas domain.  When this happens the host state transitions from
    SHOST_RECOVERY (set by scsi_schedule_eh) back to SHOST_RUNNING and
    ->host_busy is non-zero so we put the eh thread to sleep even though
    ->host_eh_scheduled is active.
    
    Before putting the error handler to sleep we need to check if the
    host_state needs to return to SHOST_RECOVERY for another trip through
    eh.  Since i/o that is released by scsi_restart_operations has been
    blocked for at least one eh cycle, this implementation allows those
    i/o's to run before another eh cycle starts to discourage hung task
    timeouts.

    SCSI: libsas: fix sas_discover_devices return code handling

    commit 19252de6 [SCSI] libsas: fix wide port hotplug issues
    
    The above commits seem to have confused the return value of
    sas_ex_discover_dev which is non-zero on failure and
    sas_ex_join_wide_port which just indicates short circuiting discovery on
    already established ports.  The result is random discovery failures
    depending on configuration.
    
    Calls to sas_ex_join_wide_port are the source of the trouble as its
    return value is errantly assigned to 'res'.  Convert it to bool and stop
    returning its result up the stack.

    powerpc/85xx: use the BRx registers to enable indirect mode on the P1022DS
    
    commit 6bd825f02966be8ba544047cab313d6032c23819 upstream.
    
    In order to enable the DIU video controller on the P1022DS, the FPGA needs
    to be switched to "indirect mode", where the localbus is disabled and
    the FPGA is accessed via writes to localbus chip select signals CS0 and CS1.
    
    To obtain the address of CS0 and CS1, the platform driver uses an "indirect
    pixis mode" device tree node.  This node assumes that the localbus 'ranges'
    property is sorted in chip-select order.  That is, reg value 0 maps to
    CS0, reg value 1 maps to CS1, etc.  This is how the 'ranges' property is
    supposed to be arranged.
    
    Unfortunately, the 'ranges' property is often mis-arranged, and not just on
    the P1022DS.  Linux normally does not care, since it does not program the
    localbus.  But the indirect-mode code on the P1022DS does care.
    
    The "proper" fix is to have U-Boot fix the 'ranges' property, but this would
    be too cumbersome.  The names and 'reg' properties of all the localbus
    devices would also need to be updated, and determining which localbus device
    maps to which chip select is board-specific.
    
    Instead, we determine the CS0/CS1 base addresses the same way that U-boot
    does -- by reading the BRx registers directly and mapping them to physical
    addresses.  This code is simpler and more reliable, and it does not require
    a U-boot or device tree change.
    
    Since the indirect pixis device tree node is no longer needed, the node is
    deleted from the DTS.

    commit 10db8d212864cb6741df7d7fafda5ab6661f6f88 upstream.
    
    Function eeh_event_handler() dereferences the pointer returned by
    handle_eeh_events() without checking, causing a crash if NULL was
    returned, which is expected in some situations.
    
    This patch fixes this bug by checking for the value returned by
    handle_eeh_events() before dereferencing it.

    mmc: sdhci: fix incorrect command used in tuning
    
    commit 473b095a72a95ba719905b1f2e82cd18d099a427 upstream.
    
    For SD hosts using retuning mode 1, when retuning timer expired, it will
    need to do retuning in sdhci_request before processing the actual
    request. But the retuning command is fixed: cmd19 for SD card and cmd21
    for eMMC card, so we can't use the original request's command to do the
    tuning.
    
    And since the tuning command depends on the card type attached to the
    host, we will need to know the card type to use the correct tuning
    command.

    mmc: sdhci-pci: CaFe has broken card detection
    
    commit 55fc05b7414274f17795cd0e8a3b1546f3649d5e upstream.
    
    At http://dev.laptop.org/ticket/11980 we have determined that the
    Marvell CaFe SDHCI controller reports bad card presence during
    resume. It reports that no card is present even when it is.
    This is a regression -- resume worked back around 2.6.37.
    
    Around 400ms after resuming, a "card inserted" interrupt is
    generated, at which point it starts reporting presence.
    
    Work around this hardware oddity by setting the
    SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_CARD_DETECTION flag.
    Thanks to Chris Ball for helping with diagnosis.

    iscsi-target: Drop bogus struct file usage for iSCSI/SCTP
    
    commit bf6932f44a7b3fa7e2246a8b18a44670e5eab6c2 upstream.
    
    From Al Viro:
    
            BTW, speaking of struct file treatment related to sockets -
            there's this piece of code in iscsi:
            /*
             * The SCTP stack needs struct socket->file.
             */
            if ((np->np_network_transport == ISCSI_SCTP_TCP) ||
                (np->np_network_transport == ISCSI_SCTP_UDP)) {
                    if (!new_sock->file) {
                            new_sock->file = kzalloc(
                                            sizeof(struct file), GFP_KERNEL);
    
    For one thing, as far as I can see it'not true - sctp does *not* depend on
    socket->file being non-NULL; it does, in one place, check socket->file->f_flags
    for O_NONBLOCK, but there it treats NULL socket->file as "flag not set".
    Which is the case here anyway - the fake struct file created in
    __iscsi_target_login_thread() (and in iscsi_target_setup_login_socket(), with
    the same excuse) do *not* get that flag set.
    
    Moreover, it's a bloody serious violation of a bunch of asserts in VFS;
    all struct file instances should come from filp_cachep, via get_empty_filp()
    (or alloc_file(), which is a wrapper for it).  FWIW, I'm very tempted to
    do this and be done with the entire mess:

    target: Add generation of LOGICAL BLOCK ADDRESS OUT OF RANGE
    
    commit e2397c704429025bc6b331a970f699e52f34283e upstream.
    
    Many SCSI commands are defined to return a CHECK CONDITION / ILLEGAL
    REQUEST with ASC set to LOGICAL BLOCK ADDRESS OUT OF RANGE if the
    initiator sends a command that accesses a too-big LBA.  Add an enum
    value and case entries so that target code can return this status.
