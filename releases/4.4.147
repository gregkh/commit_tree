    commit 92d34134193e5b129dc24f8d79cb9196626e8d7a upstream.
    
    The code is assuming the buffer is max_size length, but we weren't
    allocating enough space for it.

    ring_buffer: tracing: Inherit the tracing setting to next ring buffer
    
    commit 73c8d8945505acdcbae137c2e00a1232e0be709f upstream.
    
    Maintain the tracing on/off setting of the ring_buffer when switching
    to the trace buffer snapshot.
    
    Taking a snapshot is done by swapping the backup ring buffer
    (max_tr_buffer). But since the tracing on/off setting is defined
    by the ring buffer, when swapping it, the tracing on/off setting
    can also be changed. This causes a strange result like below:
    
      /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # cat tracing_on
      1
      /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo 0 > tracing_on
      /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # cat tracing_on
      0
      /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo 1 > snapshot
      /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # cat tracing_on
      1
      /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo 1 > snapshot
      /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # cat tracing_on
      0
    
    We don't touch tracing_on, but snapshot changes tracing_on
    setting each time. This is an anomaly, because user doesn't know
    that each "ring_buffer" stores its own tracing-enable state and
    the snapshot is done by swapping ring buffers.

    ACPI / PCI: Bail early in acpi_pci_add_bus() if there is no ACPI handle
    
    commit a0040c0145945d3bd203df8fa97f6dfa819f3f7d upstream.
    
    Hyper-V instances support PCI pass-through which is implemented through PV
    pci-hyperv driver. When a device is passed through, a new root PCI bus is
    created in the guest. The bus sits on top of VMBus and has no associated
    information in ACPI. acpi_pci_add_bus() in this case proceeds all the way
    to acpi_evaluate_dsm(), which reports
    
      ACPI: \: failed to evaluate _DSM (0x1001)
    
    While acpi_pci_slot_enumerate() and acpiphp_enumerate_slots() are protected
    against ACPI_HANDLE() being NULL and do nothing, acpi_evaluate_dsm() is not
    and gives us the error. It seems the correct fix is to not do anything in
    acpi_pci_add_bus() in such cases.

    ext4: fix false negatives *and* false positives in ext4_check_descriptors()
    
    commit 44de022c4382541cebdd6de4465d1f4f465ff1dd upstream.
    
    Ext4_check_descriptors() was getting called before s_gdb_count was
    initialized.  So for file systems w/o the meta_bg feature, allocation
    bitmaps could overlap the block group descriptors and ext4 wouldn't
    notice.
    
    For file systems with the meta_bg feature enabled, there was a
    fencepost error which would cause the ext4_check_descriptors() to
    incorrectly believe that the block allocation bitmap overlaps with the
    block group descriptor blocks, and it would reject the mount.
    
    Fix both of these problems.

    netlink: Don't shift on 64 for ngroups
    
    commit 91874ecf32e41b5d86a4cb9d60e0bee50d828058 upstream.
    
    It's legal to have 64 groups for netlink_sock.
    
    As user-supplied nladdr->nl_groups is __u32, it's possible to subscribe
    only to first 32 groups.
    
    The check for correctness of .bind() userspace supplied parameter
    is done by applying mask made from ngroups shift. Which broke Android
    as they have 64 groups and the shift for mask resulted in an overflow.

    commit 80d20d35af1edd632a5e7a3b9c0ab7ceff92769e upstream.
    
    local_timer_softirq_pending() checks whether the timer softirq is
    pending with: local_softirq_pending() & TIMER_SOFTIRQ.
    
    This is wrong because TIMER_SOFTIRQ is the softirq number and not a
    bitmask. So the test checks for the wrong bit.
    
    Use BIT(TIMER_SOFTIRQ) instead.

    genirq: Make force irq threading setup more robust
    
    commit d1f0301b3333eef5efbfa1fe0f0edbea01863d5d upstream.
    
    The support of force threading interrupts which are set up with both a
    primary and a threaded handler wreckaged the setup of regular requested
    threaded interrupts (primary handler == NULL).
    
    The reason is that it does not check whether the primary handler is set to
    the default handler which wakes the handler thread. Instead it replaces the
    thread handler with the primary handler as it would do with force threaded
    interrupts which have been requested via request_irq(). So both the primary
    and the thread handler become the same which then triggers the warnon that
    the thread handler tries to wakeup a not configured secondary thread.
    
    Fortunately this only happens when the driver omits the IRQF_ONESHOT flag
    when requesting the threaded interrupt, which is normaly caught by the
    sanity checks when force irq threading is disabled.
    
    Fix it by skipping the force threading setup when a regular threaded
    interrupt is requested. As a consequence the interrupt request which lacks
    the IRQ_ONESHOT flag is rejected correctly instead of silently wreckaging
    it.
