    powerpc: scan_features() updates incorrect bits for REAL_LE
    
    commit 6997e57d693b07289694239e52a10d2f02c3a46f upstream.
    
    The REAL_LE feature entry in the ibm_pa_feature struct is missing an MMU
    feature value, meaning all the remaining elements initialise the wrong
    values.
    
    This means instead of checking for byte 5, bit 0, we check for byte 0,
    bit 0, and then we incorrectly set the CPU feature bit as well as MMU
    feature bit 1 and CPU user feature bits 0 and 2 (5).
    
    Checking byte 0 bit 0 (IBM numbering), means we're looking at the
    "Memory Management Unit (MMU)" feature - ie. does the CPU have an MMU.
    In practice that bit is set on all platforms which have the property.
    
    This means we set CPU_FTR_REAL_LE always. In practice that seems not to
    matter because all the modern cpus which have this property also
    implement REAL_LE, and we've never needed to disable it.
    
    We're also incorrectly setting MMU feature bit 1, which is:
    
      #define MMU_FTR_TYPE_8xx              0x00000002
    
    Luckily the only place that looks for MMU_FTR_TYPE_8xx is in Book3E
    code, which can't run on the same cpus as scan_features(). So this also
    doesn't matter in practice.
    
    Finally in the CPU user feature mask, we're setting bits 0 and 2. Bit 2
    is not currently used, and bit 0 is:
    
      #define PPC_FEATURE_PPC_LE            0x00000001
    
    Which says the CPU supports the old style "PPC Little Endian" mode.
    Again this should be harmless in practice as no 64-bit CPUs implement
    that mode.
    
    Fix the code by adding the missing initialisation of the MMU feature.
    
    Also add a comment marking CPU user feature bit 2 (0x4) as reserved. It
    would be unsafe to start using it as old kernels incorrectly set it.

    Input: ads7846 - correct the value got from SPI
    
    commit 879f2fea8a5a748bcbf98d2cdce9139c045505d3 upstream.
    
    According to the touch controller spec, SPI return a 16 bit value, only 12
    bits are valid, they are bit[14-3].
    
    The value of MISO and MOSI can be configured when SPI is in idle mode.
    Currently this touch driver assumes the SPI bus sets the MOSI and MISO in
    low level when SPI bus is in idle mode. So the bit[15] of the value got
    from SPI bus is always 0. But when SPI bus congfigures the MOSI and MISO in
    high level during the SPI idle mode, the bit[15] of the value get from SPI
    is always 1. If bit[15] is not masked, we may get the wrong value.
    
    Mask the invalid bit to make sure the correct value gets returned.
    Regardless of the SPI bus idle configuration.

    x86/sysfb_efi: Fix valid BAR address range check
    
    commit c10fcb14c7afd6688c7b197a814358fecf244222 upstream.
    
    The code for checking whether a BAR address range is valid will break
    out of the loop when a start address of 0x0 is encountered.
    
    This behaviour is wrong since by breaking out of the loop we may miss
    the BAR that describes the EFI frame buffer in a later iteration.
    
    Because of this bug I can't use video=efifb: boot parameter to get
    efifb on my new ThinkPad E550 for my old linux system hard disk with
    3.10 kernel. In 3.10, efifb is the only choice due to DRM/I915 not
    supporting the GPU.
    
    This patch also add a trivial optimization to break out after we find
    the frame buffer address range without testing later BARs.

    x86/tsc: Read all ratio bits from MSR_PLATFORM_INFO
    
    commit 886123fb3a8656699dff40afa0573df359abeb18 upstream.
    
    Currently we read the tsc radio: ratio = (MSR_PLATFORM_INFO >> 8) & 0x1f;
    
    Thus we get bit 8-12 of MSR_PLATFORM_INFO, however according to the SDM
    (35.5), the ratio bits are bit 8-15.
    
    Ignoring the upper bits can result in an incorrect tsc ratio, which causes the
    TSC calibration and the Local APIC timer frequency to be incorrect.
    
    Fix this problem by masking 0xff instead.

    batman-adv: Reduce refcnt of removed router when updating route
    
    commit d1a65f1741bfd9c69f9e4e2ad447a89b6810427d upstream.
    
    _batadv_update_route rcu_derefences orig_ifinfo->router outside of a
    spinlock protected region to print some information messages to the debug
    log. But this pointer is not checked again when the new pointer is assigned
    in the spinlock protected region. Thus is can happen that the value of
    orig_ifinfo->router changed in the meantime and thus the reference counter
    of the wrong router gets reduced after the spinlock protected region.
    
    Just rcu_dereferencing the value of orig_ifinfo->router inside the spinlock
    protected region (which also set the new pointer) is enough to get the
    correct old router object.

    proc: prevent accessing /proc/<PID>/environ until it's ready
    
    commit 8148a73c9901a8794a50f950083c00ccf97d43b3 upstream.
    
    If /proc/<PID>/environ gets read before the envp[] array is fully set up
    in create_{aout,elf,elf_fdpic,flat}_tables(), we might end up trying to
    read more bytes than are actually written, as env_start will already be
    set but env_end will still be zero, making the range calculation
    underflow, allowing to read beyond the end of what has been written.
    
    Fix this as it is done for /proc/<PID>/cmdline by testing env_end for
    zero.  It is, apparently, intentionally set last in create_*_tables().
    
    This bug was found by the PaX size_overflow plugin that detected the
    arithmetic underflow of 'this_len = env_end - (env_start + src)' when
    env_end is still zero.
    
    The expected consequence is that userland trying to access
    /proc/<PID>/environ of a not yet fully set up process may get
    inconsistent data as we're in the middle of copying in the environment
    variables.

    commit 5616f36713ea77f57ae908bf2fef641364403c9f upstream.
    
    The secondary CPU starts up in ARM mode. When the kernel is compiled in
    thumb2 mode we have to explicitly compile the secondary startup
    trampoline in ARM mode, otherwise the CPU will go to Nirvana.

    tracing: Don't display trigger file for events that can't be enabled
    
    commit 854145e0a8e9a05f7366d240e2f99d9c1ca6d6dd upstream.
    
    Currently register functions for events will be called
    through the 'reg' field of event class directly without
    any check when seting up triggers.
    
    Triggers for events that don't support register through
    debug fs (events under events/ftrace are for trace-cmd to
    read event format, and most of them don't have a register
    function except events/ftrace/functionx) can't be enabled
    at all, and an oops will be hit when setting up trigger
    for those events, so just not creating them is an easy way
    to avoid the oops.

    lpfc: fix misleading indentation
    
    commit aeb6641f8ebdd61939f462a8255b316f9bfab707 upstream.
    
    gcc-6 complains about the indentation of the lpfc_destroy_vport_work_array()
    call in lpfc_online(), which clearly doesn't look right:
    
    drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.c: In function 'lpfc_online':
    drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.c:2880:3: warning: statement is indented as if it were guarded by... [-Wmisleading-indentation]
       lpfc_destroy_vport_work_array(phba, vports);
       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.c:2863:2: note: ...this 'if' clause, but it is not
      if (vports != NULL)
      ^~
    
    Looking at the patch that introduced this code, it's clear that the
    behavior is correct and the indentation is wrong.
    
    This fixes the indentation and adds curly braces around the previous
    if() block for clarity, as that is most likely what caused the code
    to be misindented in the first place.

    clk: versatile: sp810: support reentrance
    
    commit ec7957a6aa0aaf981fb8356dc47a2cdd01cde03c upstream.
    
    Despite care take to allocate clocks state containers the
    SP810 driver actually just supports creating one instance:
    all clocks registered for every instance will end up with the
    exact same name and __clk_init() will fail.
    
    Rename the timclken<0> .. timclken<n> to sp810_<instance>_<n>
    so every clock on every instance gets a unique name.
    
    This is necessary for the RealView PBA8 which has two SP810
    blocks: the second block will not register its clocks unless
    every clock on every instance is unique and results in boot
    logs like this:

    nbd: ratelimit error msgs after socket close
    
    commit da6ccaaa79caca4f38b540b651238f87215217a2 upstream.
    
    Make the "Attempted send on closed socket" error messages generated in
    nbd_request_handler() ratelimited.
    
    When the nbd socket is shutdown, the nbd_request_handler() function emits
    an error message for every request remaining in its queue.  If the queue
    is large, this will spam a large amount of messages to the log.  There's
    no need for a separate error message for each request, so this patch
    ratelimits it.
    
    In the specific case this was found, the system was virtual and the error
    messages were logged to the serial port, which overwhelmed it.

    ipvs: correct initial offset of Call-ID header search in SIP persistence engine
    
    commit 7617a24f83b5d67f4dab1844956be1cebc44aec8 upstream.
    
    The IPVS SIP persistence engine is not able to parse the SIP header
    "Call-ID" when such header is inserted in the first positions of
    the SIP message.
    
    When IPVS is configured with "--pe sip" option, like for example:
    ipvsadm -A -u 1.2.3.4:5060 -s rr --pe sip -p 120 -o
    some particular messages (see below for details) do not create entries
    in the connection template table, which can be listed with:
    ipvsadm -Lcn --persistent-conn
    
    Problematic SIP messages are SIP responses having "Call-ID" header
    positioned just after message first line:
    SIP/2.0 200 OK
    [Call-ID header here]
    [rest of the headers]
    
    When "Call-ID" header is positioned down (after a few other headers)
    it is correctly recognized.
    
    This is due to the data offset used in get_callid function call inside
    ip_vs_pe_sip.c file: since dptr already points to the start of the
    SIP message, the value of dataoff should be initially 0.
    Otherwise the header is searched starting from some bytes after the
    first character of the SIP message.

    x86: LLVMLinux: Fix "incomplete type const struct x86cpu_device_id"
    
    commit c4586256f0c440bc2bdb29d2cbb915f0ca785d26 upstream.
    
    Similar to the fix in 40413dcb7b273bda681dca38e6ff0bbb3728ef11
    
    MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(x86cpu, ...) expects the struct to be called struct
    x86cpu_device_id, and not struct x86_cpu_id which is what is used in the rest
    of the kernel code.  Although gcc seems to ignore this error, clang fails
    without this define to fix the name.
    
    Code from drivers/thermal/x86_pkg_temp_thermal.c
    static const struct x86_cpu_id __initconst pkg_temp_thermal_ids[] = { ... };
    MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(x86cpu, pkg_temp_thermal_ids);
    
    Error from clang:
    drivers/thermal/x86_pkg_temp_thermal.c:577:1: error: variable has

    compiler-gcc: disable -ftracer for __noclone functions
    
    commit 95272c29378ee7dc15f43fa2758cb28a5913a06d upstream.
    
    -ftracer can duplicate asm blocks causing compilation to fail in
    noclone functions.  For example, KVM declares a global variable
    in an asm like
    
        asm("2: ... \n
             .pushsection data \n
             .global vmx_return \n
             vmx_return: .long 2b");
    
    and -ftracer causes a double declaration.
