    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Flush link stack on guest exit to host kernel
    
    commit af2e8c68b9c5403f77096969c516f742f5bb29e0 upstream.
    
    On some systems that are vulnerable to Spectre v2, it is up to
    software to flush the link stack (return address stack), in order to
    protect against Spectre-RSB.
    
    When exiting from a guest we do some house keeping and then
    potentially exit to C code which is several stack frames deep in the
    host kernel. We will then execute a series of returns without
    preceeding calls, opening up the possiblity that the guest could have
    poisoned the link stack, and direct speculative execution of the host
    to a gadget of some sort.
    
    To prevent this we add a flush of the link stack on exit from a guest.

    powerpc/book3s64: Fix link stack flush on context switch
    
    commit 39e72bf96f5847ba87cc5bd7a3ce0fed813dc9ad upstream.
    
    In commit ee13cb249fab ("powerpc/64s: Add support for software count
    cache flush"), I added support for software to flush the count
    cache (indirect branch cache) on context switch if firmware told us
    that was the required mitigation for Spectre v2.
    
    As part of that code we also added a software flush of the link
    stack (return address stack), which protects against Spectre-RSB
    between user processes.
    
    That is all correct for CPUs that activate that mitigation, which is
    currently Power9 Nimbus DD2.3.
    
    What I got wrong is that on older CPUs, where firmware has disabled
    the count cache, we also need to flush the link stack on context
    switch.
    
    To fix it we create a new feature bit which is not set by firmware,
    which tells us we need to flush the link stack. We set that when
    firmware tells us that either of the existing Spectre v2 mitigations
    are enabled.
    
    Then we adjust the patching code so that if we see that feature bit we
    enable the link stack flush. If we're also told to flush the count
    cache in software then we fall through and do that also.
    
    On the older CPUs we don't need to do do the software count cache
    flush, firmware has disabled it, so in that case we patch in an early
    return after the link stack flush.
    
    The naming of some of the functions is awkward after this patch,
    because they're called "count cache" but they also do link stack. But
    we'll fix that up in a later commit to ease backporting.
    
    This is the fix for CVE-2019-18660.

    staging: comedi: usbduxfast: usbduxfast_ai_cmdtest rounding error
    
    commit 5618332e5b955b4bff06d0b88146b971c8dd7b32 upstream.
    
    The userspace comedilib function 'get_cmd_generic_timed' fills
    the cmd structure with an informed guess and then calls the
    function 'usbduxfast_ai_cmdtest' in this driver repeatedly while
    'usbduxfast_ai_cmdtest' is modifying the cmd struct until it
    no longer changes. However, because of rounding errors this never
    converged because 'steps = (cmd->convert_arg * 30) / 1000' and then
    back to 'cmd->convert_arg = (steps * 1000) / 30' won't be the same
    because of rounding errors. 'Steps' should only be converted back to
    the 'convert_arg' if 'steps' has actually been modified. In addition
    the case of steps being 0 wasn't checked which is also now done.

    The driver was setting the device remote-wakeup feature during probe in
    violation of the USB specification (which says it should only be set
    just prior to suspending the device). This could potentially waste
    power during suspend as well as lead to spurious wakeups.
    
    Note that USB core would clear the remote-wakeup feature at first

    virtio_console: allocate inbufs in add_port() only if it is needed
    
    [ Upstream commit d791cfcbf98191122af70b053a21075cb450d119 ]
    
    When we hot unplug a virtserialport and then try to hot plug again,
    it fails:
    
    (qemu) chardev-add socket,id=serial0,path=/tmp/serial0,server,nowait
    (qemu) device_add virtserialport,bus=virtio-serial0.0,nr=2,\

    kernel error:

      virtio-serial-bus: Guest failure in adding port 2 for device \
                         virtio-serial0.0
    
    This happens because buffers for the in_vq are allocated when the port is
    added but are not released when the port is unplugged.
    
    They are only released when virtconsole is removed (see a7a69ec0d8e4)
    
    To avoid the problem and to be symmetric, we could allocate all the buffers
    in init_vqs() as they are released in remove_vqs(), but it sounds like
    a waste of memory.
    
    Rather than that, this patch changes add_port() logic to ignore ENOSPC
    error in fill_queue(), which means queue has already been filled.

    [ Upstream commit 2855b33514d290c51d52d94e25d3ef942cd4d578 ]
    
    an allocated buffer doesn't need to be tied to a vq -
    only vq->vdev is ever used. Pass the function the
    just what it needs - the vdev.

    virtio_console: reset on out of memory
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c60300d68da32ca77f7f978039dc72bfc78b06b ]
    
    When out of memory and we can't add ctrl vq buffers,
    probe fails. Unfortunately the error handling is
    out of spec: it calls del_vqs without bothering
    to reset the device first.
    
    To fix, call the full cleanup function in this case.

    commit f3f5ba42c58d56d50f539854d8cc188944e96087 upstream.
    
    The touch timer is set up in intf1. If the second interface does not exist,
    the timer and touch input device are not setup and we get the following
    error, when touch events are reported via intf0.

    cpufreq: Add NULL checks to show() and store() methods of cpufreq
    
    commit e6e8df07268c1f75dd9215536e2ce4587b70f977 upstream.
    
    Add NULL checks to show() and store() in cpufreq.c to avoid attempts
    to invoke a NULL callback.
    
    Though some interfaces of cpufreq are set as read-only, users can
    still get write permission using chmod which can lead to a kernel
    crash, as follows:
    
    chmod +w /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
    echo 1 >  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq

    media: vivid: Fix wrong locking that causes race conditions on streaming stop
    
    commit 6dcd5d7a7a29c1e4b8016a06aed78cd650cd8c27 upstream.
    
    There is the same incorrect approach to locking implemented in
    vivid_stop_generating_vid_cap(), vivid_stop_generating_vid_out() and
    sdr_cap_stop_streaming().
    
    These functions are called during streaming stopping with vivid_dev.mutex
    locked. And they all do the same mistake while stopping their kthreads,
    which need to lock this mutex as well. See the example from
    vivid_stop_generating_vid_cap():
      /* shutdown control thread */
      vivid_grab_controls(dev, false);
      mutex_unlock(&dev->mutex);
      kthread_stop(dev->kthread_vid_cap);
      dev->kthread_vid_cap = NULL;
      mutex_lock(&dev->mutex);
    
    But when this mutex is unlocked, another vb2_fop_read() can lock it
    instead of vivid_thread_vid_cap() and manipulate the buffer queue.
    That causes a use-after-free access later.
    
    To fix those issues let's:
      1. avoid unlocking the mutex in vivid_stop_generating_vid_cap(),
    vivid_stop_generating_vid_out() and sdr_cap_stop_streaming();
      2. use mutex_trylock() with schedule_timeout_uninterruptible() in
    the loops of the vivid kthread handlers.

    media: vivid: Set vid_cap_streaming and vid_out_streaming to true
    
    commit b4add02d2236fd5f568db141cfd8eb4290972eb3 upstream.
    
    When vbi stream is started, followed by video streaming,
    the vid_cap_streaming and vid_out_streaming were not being set to true,
    which would cause the video stream to stop when vbi stream is stopped.
    This patch allows to set vid_cap_streaming and vid_out_streaming to true.
    According to Hans Verkuil it appears that these 'if (dev->kthread_vid_cap)'
    checks are a left-over from the original vivid development and should never
    have been there.

    x86/speculation: Fix redundant MDS mitigation message
    
    commit cd5a2aa89e847bdda7b62029d94e95488d73f6b2 upstream.
    
    Since MDS and TAA mitigations are inter-related for processors that are
    affected by both vulnerabilities, the followiing confusing messages can
    be printed in the kernel log:
    
      MDS: Vulnerable
      MDS: Mitigation: Clear CPU buffers
    
    To avoid the first incorrect message, defer the printing of MDS
    mitigation after the TAA mitigation selection has been done. However,
    that has the side effect of printing TAA mitigation first before MDS
    mitigation.
    
     [ bp: Check box is affected/mitigations are disabled first before
       printing and massage. ]

    x86/speculation: Fix incorrect MDS/TAA mitigation status
    
    commit 64870ed1b12e235cfca3f6c6da75b542c973ff78 upstream.
    
    For MDS vulnerable processors with TSX support, enabling either MDS or
    TAA mitigations will enable the use of VERW to flush internal processor
    buffers at the right code path. IOW, they are either both mitigated
    or both not. However, if the command line options are inconsistent,
    the vulnerabilites sysfs files may not report the mitigation status
    correctly.
    
    For example, with only the "mds=off" option:
    
      vulnerabilities/mds:Vulnerable; SMT vulnerable
      vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort:Mitigation: Clear CPU buffers; SMT vulnerable
    
    The mds vulnerabilities file has wrong status in this case. Similarly,
    the taa vulnerability file will be wrong with mds mitigation on, but
    taa off.
    
    Change taa_select_mitigation() to sync up the two mitigation status
    and have them turned off if both "mds=off" and "tsx_async_abort=off"
    are present.
    
    Update documentation to emphasize the fact that both "mds=off" and
    "tsx_async_abort=off" have to be specified together for processors that
    are affected by both TAA and MDS to be effective.

    x86/insn: Fix awk regexp warnings
    
    commit 700c1018b86d0d4b3f1f2d459708c0cdf42b521d upstream.
    
    gawk 5.0.1 generates the following regexp warnings:
    
      GEN      /home/sasha/torvalds/tools/objtool/arch/x86/lib/inat-tables.c
      awk: ../arch/x86/tools/gen-insn-attr-x86.awk:260: warning: regexp escape sequence `\:' is not a known regexp operator
      awk: ../arch/x86/tools/gen-insn-attr-x86.awk:350: (FILENAME=../arch/x86/lib/x86-opcode-map.txt FNR=41) warning: regexp escape sequence `\&' is  not a known regexp operator
    
    Ealier versions of gawk are not known to generate these warnings. The
    gawk manual referenced below does not list characters ':' and '&' as
    needing escaping, so 'unescape' them. See
    
      https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Escape-Sequences.html
    
    for more info.
    
    Running diff on the output generated by the script before and after
    applying the patch reported no differences.

    ARC: perf: Accommodate big-endian CPU
    
    commit 5effc09c4907901f0e71e68e5f2e14211d9a203f upstream.
    
    8-letter strings representing ARC perf events are stores in two
    32-bit registers as ASCII characters like that: "IJMP", "IALL", "IJMPTAK" etc.
    
    And the same order of bytes in the word is used regardless CPU endianness.
    
    Which means in case of big-endian CPU core we need to swap bytes to get
    the same order as if it was on little-endian CPU.
    
    Otherwise we're seeing the following error message on boot:
    ------------------------->8----------------------
    ARC perf        : 8 counters (32 bits), 40 conditions, [overflow IRQ support]
    sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/arc_pct/events/pmji'

    ---[ end trace a75fb9a9837bd1ec ]---
    ------------------------->8----------------------
    
    What happens here we're trying to register more than one raw perf event
    with the same name "PMJI". Why? Because ARC perf events are 4 to 8 letters
    and encoded into two 32-bit words. In this particular case we deal with 2
    events:
     * "IJMP____" which counts all jump & branch instructions
     * "IJMPC___" which counts only conditional jumps & branches
    
    Those strings are split in two 32-bit words this way "IJMP" + "____" &
    "IJMP" + "C___" correspondingly. Now if we read them swapped due to CPU core
    being big-endian then we read "PMJI" + "____" & "PMJI" + "___C".
    
    And since we interpret read array of ASCII letters as a null-terminated string
    on big-endian CPU we end up with 2 events of the same name "PMJI".

    ocfs2: remove ocfs2_is_o2cb_active()
    
    commit a634644751c46238df58bbfe992e30c1668388db upstream.
    
    Remove ocfs2_is_o2cb_active().  We have similar functions to identify
    which cluster stack is being used via osb->osb_cluster_stack.
    
    Secondly, the current implementation of ocfs2_is_o2cb_active() is not
    totally safe.  Based on the design of stackglue, we need to get
    ocfs2_stack_lock before using ocfs2_stack related data structures, and
    that active_stack pointer can be NULL in the case of mount failure.

    cpufreq: Skip cpufreq resume if it's not suspended
    
    commit 703cbaa601ff3fb554d1246c336ba727cc083ea0 upstream.
    
    cpufreq_resume can be called even without preceding cpufreq_suspend.
    This can happen in following scenario:
    
        suspend_devices_and_enter
           --> dpm_suspend_start
              --> dpm_prepare
                  --> device_prepare : this function errors out
              --> dpm_suspend: this is skipped due to dpm_prepare failure
                               this means cpufreq_suspend is skipped over
           --> goto Recover_platform, due to previous error
           --> goto Resume_devices
           --> dpm_resume_end
               --> dpm_resume
                   --> cpufreq_resume
    
    In case schedutil is used as frequency governor, cpufreq_resume will
    eventually call sugov_start, which does following:
    
        memset(sg_cpu, 0, sizeof(*sg_cpu));
        ....
    
    This effectively erases function pointer for frequency update, causing
    crash later on. The function pointer would have been set correctly if
    subsequent cpufreq_add_update_util_hook runs successfully, but that
    function returns earlier because cpufreq_suspend was not called:
    
        if (WARN_ON(per_cpu(cpufreq_update_util_data, cpu)))
                    return;
    
    The fix is to check cpufreq_suspended first, if it's false, that means
    cpufreq_suspend was not called in the first place, so do not resume
    cpufreq.

    arm64: fix for bad_mode() handler to always result in panic
    
    commit e4ba15debcfd27f60d43da940a58108783bff2a6 upstream.
    
    The bad_mode() handler is called if we encounter an uunknown exception,
    with the expectation that the subsequent call to panic() will halt the
    system. Unfortunately, if the exception calling bad_mode() is taken from
    EL0, then the call to die() can end up killing the current user task and
    calling schedule() instead of falling through to panic().
    
    Remove the die() call altogether, since we really want to bring down the
    machine in this "impossible" case.

    IB/hfi1: Ensure full Gen3 speed in a Gen4 system
    
    If an hfi1 card is inserted in a Gen4 systems, the driver will avoid the
    gen3 speed bump and the card will operate at half speed.
    
    This is because the driver avoids the gen3 speed bump when the parent bus
    speed isn't identical to gen3, 8.0GT/s.  This is not compatible with gen4
    and newer speeds.
    
    Fix by relaxing the test to explicitly look for the lower capability
    speeds which inherently allows for gen4 and all future speeds.

    spi: omap2-mcspi: Fix DMA and FIFO event trigger size mismatch
    
    [ Upstream commit baf8b9f8d260c55a86405f70a384c29cda888476 ]
    
    Commit b682cffa3ac6 ("spi: omap2-mcspi: Set FIFO DMA trigger level to word length")
    broke SPI transfers where bits_per_word != 8. This is because of
    mimsatch between McSPI FIFO level event trigger size (SPI word length) and
    DMA request size(word length * maxburst). This leads to data
    corruption, lockup and errors like:
    
            spi1.0: EOW timed out
    
    Fix this by setting DMA maxburst size to 1 so that
    McSPI FIFO level event trigger size matches DMA request size.

    It is expected that pinctrl drivers can extend pin_config_param because
    of the gap between PIN_CONFIG_END and PIN_CONFIG_MAX so this conversion
    isn't an issue. Most drivers that take advantage of this define the
    PIN_CONFIG variables as constants, rather than enumerated values. Do the
    same thing here so that Clang no longer warns.

    When attempting to setup up a gpio hog, device probing would repeatedly
    fail with -EPROBE_DEFERED errors. It was caused by a circular dependency
    between the gpio and pinctrl frameworks. If the gpio-ranges property is
    present in device tree, then the gpio framework will handle the gpio pin
    registration and eliminate the circular dependency.
    
    See Christian Lamparter's commit a86caa9ba5d7 ("pinctrl: msm: fix
    gpio-hog related boot issues") for a detailed commit message that
    explains the issue in much more detail. The code comment in this commit
    came from Christian's commit.

    sock: Reset dst when changing sk_mark via setsockopt
    
    [ Upstream commit 50254256f382c56bde87d970f3d0d02fdb76ec70 ]
    
    When setting the SO_MARK socket option, if the mark changes, the dst
    needs to be reset so that a new route lookup is performed.
    
    This fixes the case where an application wants to change routing by
    setting a new sk_mark.  If this is done after some packets have already
    been sent, the dst is cached and has no effect.

    dlm: don't leak kernel pointer to userspace
    
    [ Upstream commit 9de30f3f7f4d31037cfbb7c787e1089c1944b3a7 ]
    
    In copy_result_to_user(), we first create a struct dlm_lock_result, which
    contains a struct dlm_lksb, the last member of which is a pointer to the
    lvb. Unfortunately, we copy the entire struct dlm_lksb to the result
    struct, which is then copied to userspace at the end of the function,
    leaking the contents of sb_lvbptr, which is a valid kernel pointer in some
    cases (indeed, later in the same function the data it points to is copied
    to userspace).
    
    It is an error to leak kernel pointers to userspace, as it undermines KASLR
    protections (see e.g. 65eea8edc31 ("floppy: Do not copy a kernel pointer to
    user memory in FDGETPRM ioctl") for another example of this).

    In megasas_transition_to_ready() driver waits 180seconds for controller to
    change FW state. Here we are calling msleep(1) in a loop for this.  As
    explained in timers-howto.txt, msleep(1) will actually sleep longer than
    1ms. If a faulty controller is connected, we will end up waiting for much
    more than 180 seconds causing unnecessary delays during load.
    
    Change the granularity of msleep() call from 1ms to 1000ms.

    [ Upstream commit 9029a72500b95578a35877a43473b82cb0386c53 ]
    
    This is to fix SYNC CACHE and START STOP command failures with
    DID_NO_CONNECT during driver unload.
    
    In driver's IO submission patch (i.e. in driver's .queuecommand()) driver
    won't allow any SCSI commands to the IOC when ioc->remove_host flag is set
    and hence SYNC CACHE commands which are issued to the target drives (where
    write cache is enabled) during driver unload time is failed with
    DID_NO_CONNECT status.
    
    Now modified the driver to allow SYNC CACHE and START STOP commands to IOC,
    even when remove_host flag is set.

    sched/fair: Don't increase sd->balance_interval on newidle balance
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f130a37c442d5c4d66531b240ebe9abfef426b5 ]
    
    When load_balance() fails to move some load because of task affinity,
    we end up increasing sd->balance_interval to delay the next periodic
    balance in the hopes that next time we look, that annoying pinned
    task(s) will be gone.
    
    However, idle_balance() pays no attention to sd->balance_interval, yet
    it will still lead to an increase in balance_interval in case of
    pinned tasks.
    
    If we're going through several newidle balances (e.g. we have a
    periodic task), this can lead to a huge increase of the
    balance_interval in a very small amount of time.
    
    To prevent that, don't increase the balance interval when going
    through a newidle balance.
    
    This is a similar approach to what is done in commit 58b26c4c0257
    ("sched: Increment cache_nice_tries only on periodic lb"), where we
    disregard newidle balance and rely on periodic balance for more stable
    results.

    net: do not abort bulk send on BQL status
    
    [ Upstream commit fe60faa5063822f2d555f4f326c7dd72a60929bf ]
    
    Before calling dev_hard_start_xmit(), upper layers tried
    to cook optimal skb list based on BQL budget.
    
    Problem is that GSO packets can end up comsuming more than
    the BQL budget.
    
    Breaking the loop is not useful, since requeued packets
    are ahead of any packets still in the qdisc.
    
    It is also more expensive, since next TX completion will
    push these packets later, while skbs are not in cpu caches.
    
    It is also a behavior difference with TSO packets, that can
    break the BQL limit by a large amount.
    
    Note that drivers should use __netdev_tx_sent_queue()
    in order to have optimal xmit_more support, and avoid
    useless atomic operations as shown in the following patch.

    ocfs2: fix clusters leak in ocfs2_defrag_extent()

    ocfs2_defrag_extent() might leak allocated clusters.  When the file
    system has insufficient space, the number of claimed clusters might be
    less than the caller wants.  If that happens, the original code might
    directly commit the transaction without returning clusters.
    
    This patch is based on code in ocfs2_add_clusters_in_btree().

    ocfs2: don't put and assigning null to bh allocated outside
    
    [ Upstream commit cf76c78595ca87548ca5e45c862ac9e0949c4687 ]
    
    ocfs2_read_blocks() and ocfs2_read_blocks_sync() are both used to read
    several blocks from disk.  Currently, the input argument *bhs* can be
    NULL or NOT.  It depends on the caller's behavior.  If the function
    fails in reading blocks from disk, the corresponding bh will be assigned
    to NULL and put.
    
    Obviously, above process for non-NULL input bh is not appropriate.
    Because the caller doesn't even know its bhs are put and re-assigned.
    
    If buffer head is managed by caller, ocfs2_read_blocks and
    ocfs2_read_blocks_sync() should not evaluate it to NULL.  It will cause
    caller accessing illegal memory, thus crash.

    ntb: intel: fix return value for ndev_vec_mask()
    
    [ Upstream commit 7756e2b5d68c36e170a111dceea22f7365f83256 ]
    
    ndev_vec_mask() should be returning u64 mask value instead of int.
    Otherwise the mask value returned can be incorrect for larger
    vectors.

    igb: shorten maximum PHC timecounter update interval
    
    [ Upstream commit 094bf4d0e9657f6ea1ee3d7e07ce3970796949ce ]
    
    The timecounter needs to be updated at least once per ~550 seconds in
    order to avoid a 40-bit SYSTIM timestamp to be misinterpreted as an old
    timestamp.
    
    Since commit 500462a9d ("timers: Switch to a non-cascading wheel"),
    scheduling of delayed work seems to be less accurate and a requested
    delay of 540 seconds may actually be longer than 550 seconds. Shorten
    the delay to 480 seconds to be sure the timecounter is updated in time.
    
    This fixes an issue with HW timestamps on 82580/I350/I354 being off by
    ~1100 seconds for few seconds every ~9 minutes.

    hfs: prevent btree data loss on ENOSPC
    
    [ Upstream commit 54640c7502e5ed41fbf4eedd499e85f9acc9698f ]
    
    Inserting a new record in a btree may require splitting several of its
    nodes.  If we hit ENOSPC halfway through, the new nodes will be left
    orphaned and their records will be lost.  This could mean lost inodes or
    extents.
    
    Henceforth, check the available disk space before making any changes.
    This still leaves the potential problem of corruption on ENOMEM.
    
    There is no need to reserve space before deleting a catalog record, as we
    do for hfsplus.  This difference is because hfs index nodes have fixed
    length keys.

    hfs: fix BUG on bnode parent update
    
    [ Upstream commit ef75bcc5763d130451a99825f247d301088b790b ]
    
    hfs_brec_update_parent() may hit BUG_ON() if the first record of both a
    leaf node and its parent are changed, and if this forces the parent to
    be split.  It is not possible for this to happen on a valid hfs
    filesystem because the index nodes have fixed length keys.
    
    For reasons I ignore, the hfs module does have support for a number of
    hfsplus features.  A corrupt btree header may report variable length
    keys and trigger this BUG, so it's better to fix it.

    hfsplus: fix BUG on bnode parent update
    
    [ Upstream commit 19a9d0f1acf75e8be8cfba19c1a34e941846fa2b ]
    
    Creating, renaming or deleting a file may hit BUG_ON() if the first
    record of both a leaf node and its parent are changed, and if this
    forces the parent to be split.  This bug is triggered by xfstests
    generic/027, somewhat rarely; here is a more reliable reproducer:
    
      truncate -s 50M fs.iso
      mkfs.hfsplus fs.iso
      mount fs.iso /mnt
      i=1000
      while [ $i -le 2400 ]; do
        touch /mnt/$i &>/dev/null
        ((++i))
      done
      i=2400
      while [ $i -ge 1000 ]; do
        mv /mnt/$i /mnt/$(perl -e "print $i x61") &>/dev/null
        ((--i))
      done
    
    The issue is that a newly created bnode is being put twice.  Reset
    new_node to NULL in hfs_brec_update_parent() before reaching goto again.

    linux/bitmap.h: handle constant zero-size bitmaps correctly
    
    [ Upstream commit 7275b097851a5e2e0dd4da039c7e96b59ac5314e ]
    
    The static inlines in bitmap.h do not handle a compile-time constant
    nbits==0 correctly (they dereference the passed src or dst pointers,
    despite only 0 words being valid to access).  I had the 0-day buildbot
    chew on a patch [1] that would cause build failures for such cases without
    complaining, suggesting that we don't have any such users currently, at
    least for the 70 .config/arch combinations that was built.  Should any
    turn up, make sure they use the out-of-line versions, which do handle
    nbits==0 correctly.
    
    This is of course not the most efficient, but it's much less churn than
    teaching all the static inlines an "if (zero_const_nbits())", and since we
    don't have any current instances, this doesn't affect existing code at
    all.

    This fixes a long standing bug where large amounts of output
    could freeze the tty (most commonly seen on stdio console).
    While the bug has always been there it became more pronounced
    after moving to the new interrupt controller.
    
    The line semantics are now changed to have true IRQ write
    semantics which should further improve the tty/line subsystem

                                                      <blocks>
    
        lock Page 1
        <blocks>
    
    DEADLOCK because:
    
            - process 1 needs page 2 writeback to complete to make
              enough progress to issue IO pending for page 1
            - writeback needs page 1 writeback to complete so process 2
              can progress and unlock the page it is blocked on, then it
              can issue the IO pending for page 2
            - process 2 can't make progress until process 1 issues IO
              for page 1
    
    The underlying cause of the problem here is that range_cyclic writeback is
    processing pages in descending index order as we hold higher index pages
    in a structure controlled from above write_cache_pages().  The
    write_cache_pages() caller needs to be able to submit these pages for IO
    before write_cache_pages restarts writeback at mapping index 0 to avoid
    wcp inverting the page lock/writeback wait order.
    
    generic_writepages() is not susceptible to this bug as it has no private
    context held across write_cache_pages() - filesystems using this
    infrastructure always submit pages in ->writepage immediately and so there
    is no problem with range_cyclic going back to mapping index 0.
    
    However:
            mpage_writepages() has a private bio context,
            exofs_writepages() has page_collect
            fuse_writepages() has fuse_fill_wb_data
            nfs_writepages() has nfs_pageio_descriptor
            xfs_vm_writepages() has xfs_writepage_ctx
    
    All of these ->writepages implementations can hold pages under writeback
    in their private structures until write_cache_pages() returns, and hence
    they are all susceptible to this deadlock.
    
    Also worth noting is that ext4 has it's own bastardised version of
    write_cache_pages() and so it /may/ have an equivalent deadlock.  I looked
    at the code long enough to understand that it has a similar retry loop for
    range_cyclic writeback reaching the end of the file and then promptly ran
    away before my eyes bled too much.  I'll leave it for the ext4 developers
    to determine if their code is actually has this deadlock and how to fix it
    if it has.
    
    There's a few ways I can see avoid this deadlock.  There's probably more,
    but these are the first I've though of:
    
    1. get rid of range_cyclic altogether
    
    2. range_cyclic always stops at EOF, and we start again from
    writeback index 0 on the next call into write_cache_pages()
    
    2a. wcp also returns EAGAIN to ->writepages implementations to
    indicate range cyclic has hit EOF. writepages implementations can
    then flush the current context and call wpc again to continue. i.e.
    lift the retry into the ->writepages implementation
    
    3. range_cyclic uses trylock_page() rather than lock_page(), and it
    skips pages it can't lock without blocking. It will already do this
    for pages under writeback, so this seems like a no-brainer
    
    3a. all non-WB_SYNC_ALL writeback uses trylock_page() to avoid
    blocking as per pages under writeback.
    
    I don't think #1 is an option - range_cyclic prevents frequently
    dirtied lower file offset from starving background writeback of
    rarely touched higher file offsets.
    
    #2 is simple, and I don't think it will have any impact on
    performance as going back to the start of the file implies an
    immediate seek. We'll have exactly the same number of seeks if we
    switch writeback to another inode, and then come back to this one
    later and restart from index 0.
    
    #2a is pretty much "status quo without the deadlock". Moving the
    retry loop up into the wcp caller means we can issue IO on the
    pending pages before calling wcp again, and so avoid locking or
    waiting on pages in the wrong order. I'm not convinced we need to do
    this given that we get the same thing from #2 on the next writeback
    call from the writeback infrastructure.
    
    #3 is really just a band-aid - it doesn't fix the access/wait
    inversion problem, just prevents it from becoming a deadlock
    situation. I'd prefer we fix the inversion, not sweep it under the
    carpet like this.
    
    #3a is really an optimisation that just so happens to include the
    band-aid fix of #3.
    
    So it seems that the simplest way to fix this issue is to implement
    solution #2

    [ Upstream commit 999865764f5f128896402572b439269acb471022 ]
    
    The kernel module may sleep with holding a spinlock.

    To fix this bug, GFP_NOFS is replaced with GFP_ATOMIC.
    
    This bug is found by my static analysis tool DSAC.

    [ Upstream commit 55143439b7b501882bea9d95a54adfe00ffc79a3 ]
    
    When trying to read any MC13892 ADC channel on a imx51-babbage board:
    
    The MC13892 PMIC shutdowns completely.
    
    After debugging this issue and comparing the MC13892 and MC13783
    initializations done in the vendor kernel, it was noticed that the
    CHRGRAWDIV bit of the ADC0 register was not being set.
    
    This bit is set by default after power on, but the driver was
    clearing it.
    
    After setting this bit it is possible to read the ADC values correctly.

                 ^
    2 warnings generated.
    
    The root cause is that the _IOC macro can generate really large numbers,
    which don't find into type int. My research into how GCC and Clang are
    handling this at a low level didn't prove fruitful and surveying the
    kernel tree shows that aside from here and a few places in the scsi
    subsystem, everything that uses _IOC is at least of type 'unsigned int'.
    Make that change here because as nothing in this function cares about
    the signedness of the variable and it removes ambiguity, which is never
    good when dealing with compilers.
    
    While we're here, remove the unnecessary local variable ret (just return
    -EINVAL and 0 directly).

    spi: omap2-mcspi: Set FIFO DMA trigger level to word length
    
    [ Upstream commit b682cffa3ac6d9d9e16e9b413c45caee3b391fab ]
    
    McSPI has 32 byte FIFO in Transmit-Receive mode. Current code tries to
    configuration FIFO watermark level for DMA trigger to be GCD of transfer
    length and max FIFO size which would mean trigger level may be set to 32
    for transmit-receive mode if length is aligned. This does not work in
    case of SPI slave mode where FIFO always needs to have data ready
    whenever master starts the clock. With DMA trigger size of 32 there will
    be a small window during slave TX where DMA is still putting data into
    FIFO but master would have started clock for next byte, resulting in
    shifting out of stale data. Similarly, on Slave RX side there may be RX
    FIFO overflow
    Fix this by setting FIFO watermark for DMA trigger to word
    length. This means DMA is triggered as soon as FIFO has space for word
    length bytes and DMA would make sure FIFO is almost always full
    therefore improving FIFO occupancy in both master and slave mode.

    Return an error when the function debug_register() fails allocating
    the debug handle.
    Also remove the registered debug handle when the initialization fails
    later on.

    USB: misc: appledisplay: fix backlight update_status return code
    
    [ Upstream commit 090158555ff8d194a98616034100b16697dd80d0 ]
    
    Upon success the update_status handler returns a positive number
    corresponding to the number of bytes transferred by usb_control_msg.
    However the return code of the update_status handler should indicate if
    an error occurred(negative) or how many bytes of the user's input to sysfs
    that was consumed. Return code zero indicates all bytes were consumed.
    
    The bug can for example result in the update_status handler being called
    twice, the second time with only the "unconsumed" part of the user's input
    to sysfs. Effectively setting an incorrect brightness.
    
    Change the update_status handler to return zero for all successful
    transactions and forward usb_control_msg's error code upon failure.

    kprobes, x86/ptrace.h: Make regs_get_kernel_stack_nth() not fault on bad stack
    
    [ Upstream commit c2712b858187f5bcd7b042fe4daa3ba3a12635c0 ]
    
    Andy had some concerns about using regs_get_kernel_stack_nth() in a new
    function regs_get_kernel_argument() as if there's any error in the stack
    code, it could cause a bad memory access. To be on the safe side, call
    probe_kernel_read() on the stack address to be extra careful in accessing
    the memory. A helper function, regs_get_kernel_stack_nth_addr(), was added
    to just return the stack address (or NULL if not on the stack), that will be
    used to find the address (and could be used by other functions) and read the
    address with kernel_probe_read().

    misc: mic: fix a DMA pool free failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 6b995f4eec34745f6cb20d66d5277611f0b3c3fa ]
    
    In _scif_prog_signal(), the boolean variable 'x100' is used to indicate
    whether the MIC Coprocessor is X100. If 'x100' is true, the status
    descriptor will be used to write the value to the destination. Otherwise, a
    DMA pool will be allocated for this purpose. Specifically, if the DMA pool
    is allocated successfully, two memory addresses will be returned. One is
    for the CPU and the other is for the device to access the DMA pool. The
    former is stored to the variable 'status' and the latter is stored to the
    variable 'src'. After the allocation, the address in 'src' is saved to
    'status->src_dma_addr', which is actually in the DMA pool, and 'src' is
    then modified.
    
    Later on, if an error occurs, the execution flow will transfer to the label
    'dma_fail', which will check 'x100' and free up the allocated DMA pool if
    'x100' is false. The point here is that 'status->src_dma_addr' is used for
    freeing up the DMA pool. As mentioned before, 'status->src_dma_addr' is in
    the DMA pool. And thus, the device is able to modify this data. This can
    potentially cause failures when freeing up the DMA pool because of the
    modified device address.
    
    This patch avoids the above issue by using the variable 'src' (with
    necessary calculation) to free up the DMA pool.

    gsmi: Fix bug in append_to_eventlog sysfs handler
    
    [ Upstream commit 655603de68469adaff16842ac17a5aec9c9ce89b ]
    
    The sysfs handler should return the number of bytes consumed, which in the
    case of a successful write is the entire buffer.  Also fix a bug where
    param.data_len was being set to (count - (2 * sizeof(u32))) instead of just
    (count - sizeof(u32)).  The latter is correct because we skip over the
    leading u32 which is our param.type, but we were also incorrectly
    subtracting sizeof(u32) on the line where we were actually setting
    param.data_len:
    
            param.data_len = count - sizeof(u32);
    
    This meant that for our example event.kernel_software_watchdog with total
    length 10 bytes, param.data_len was just 2 prior to this change.
    
    To test, successfully append an event to the log with gsmi sysfs.
    This sample event is for a "Kernel Software Watchdog"

    btrfs: handle error of get_old_root
    
    [ Upstream commit 315bed43fea532650933e7bba316a7601d439edf ]
    
    In btrfs_search_old_slot get_old_root is always used with the assumption
    it cannot fail. However, this is not true in rare circumstance it can
    fail and return null. This will lead to null point dereference when the
    header is read. Fix this by checking the return value and properly
    handling NULL by setting ret to -EIO and returning gracefully.

    Since commit 9ec36cafe43b ("of/irq: do irq resolution in platform_get_irq")
    platform_get_irq() can return -EPROBE_DEFER. However, the driver overrides
    an error returned by that function with -ENOENT which breaks the deferred

    and remove the bogus "platform" from the error message, while at it...

    brcmsmac: AP mode: update beacon when TIM changes
    
    [ Upstream commit 2258ee58baa554609a3cc3996276e4276f537b6d ]
    
    Beacons are not updated to reflect TIM changes. This is not compliant with
    power-saving client stations as the beacons do not have valid TIM and can
    cause the network to stall at random occasions and to have highly variable
    latencies.
    Fix it by updating beacon templates on mac80211 set_tim callback.

    powerpc/eeh: Fix use of EEH_PE_KEEP on wrong field
    
    [ Upstream commit 473af09b56dc4be68e4af33220ceca6be67aa60d ]
    
    eeh_add_to_parent_pe() sometimes removes the EEH_PE_KEEP flag, but it
    incorrectly removes it from pe->type, instead of pe->state.
    
    However, rather than clearing it from the correct field, remove it.
    Inspection of the code shows that it can't ever have had any effect
    (even if it had been cleared from the correct field), because the
    field is never tested after it is cleared by the statement in
    question.
    
    The clear statement was added by commit 807a827d4e74 ("powerpc/eeh:
    Keep PE during hotplug"), but it didn't explain why it was necessary.

    size_t so negative values of "count" are treated as very high values
    and we accidentally return success instead of a negative error code.

    printk: fix integer overflow in setup_log_buf()
    
    [ Upstream commit d2130e82e9454304e9b91ba9da551b5989af8c27 ]
    
    The way we calculate logbuf free space percentage overflows signed
    integer:
    
            int free;
    
            free = __LOG_BUF_LEN - log_next_idx;
            pr_info("early log buf free: %u(%u%%)\n",
                    free, (free * 100) / __LOG_BUF_LEN);
    
    We support LOG_BUF_LEN of up to 1<<25 bytes. Since setup_log_buf() is
    called during early init, logbuf is mostly empty, so
    
            __LOG_BUF_LEN - log_next_idx
    
    is close to 1<<25. Thus when we multiply it by 100, we overflow signed
    integer value range: 100 is 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^2.
    
    Example, booting with LOG_BUF_LEN 1<<25 and log_buf_len=2G
    boot param:
    
    [    0.075317] log_buf_len: -2147483648 bytes
    [    0.075319] early log buf free: 33549896(-28%)
    
    Make "free" unsigned integer and use appropriate printk() specifier.

    By referencing Intel Platform Controller Hub(PCH) datasheet,
    the xHC USB 2.0 Port Routing(XUSB2PR) at offset 0xD0-0xD3h
    decides the setting of mapping the port to EHCI controller or
    xHC controller. And the port mapped to xHC will enable xHCI
    during bus resume.
    
    The setting of disabling bluetooth adapter's connected port is
    0x000001D9. The value can be obtained by few times 1 bit flip
    operation. The suited configuration should have the 'lsusb -t'
    result with bluetooth using ehci:
    
    /:  Bus 03.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/4p, 5000M
    /:  Bus 02.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/9p, 480M

    acpi_video0 doesn't work, asus-wmi brightness interface doesn't work, too.
    So, we use native brightness interface to handle the brightness adjustion,
    and add quirk_asus_ux303ub.

    platform/x86: asus-wmi: Filter buggy scan codes on ASUS Q500A
    
    [ Upstream commit b5643539b82559b858b8efe3fc8343f66cf9a0b5 ]
    
    Some revisions of the ASUS Q500A series have a keyboard related
    issue which is reproducible only after Windows with installed ASUS
    tools is started.
    
    In this case the Linux side will have a blocked keyboard or
    report incorrect or incomplete hotkey events.
    
    To make Linux work properly again, a complete power down
    (unplug power supply and remove battery) is needed.
    
    Linux/atkbd after a clean start will get the following code on VOLUME_UP
    key: {0xe0, 0x30, 0xe0, 0xb0}. After Windows, the same key will generate
    this codes: {0xe1, 0x23, 0xe0, 0x30, 0xe0, 0xb0}. As result atkdb will
    be confused by buggy codes.
    
    This patch is filtering this buggy code out.

    asus-wmi: Create quirk for airplane_mode LED
    
    [ Upstream commit a977e59c0c67c9d492bb16677ce66d67cae0ebd8 ]
    
    Some Asus laptops that have an airplane-mode indicator LED, also have
    the WMI WLAN user bit set, and the following bits in their DSDT:
    
    Scope (_SB)
    {
      (...)
      Device (ATKD)
      {
        (...)
        Method (WMNB, 3, Serialized)
        {
          (...)
          If (LEqual (IIA0, 0x00010002))
          {
            OWGD (IIA1)
            Return (One)
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
    So when asus-wmi uses ASUS_WMI_DEVID_WLAN_LED (0x00010002) to store the
    wlan state, it drives the airplane-mode indicator LED (through the call
    to OWGD) in an inverted fashion: the LED is ON when airplane mode is OFF
    (since wlan is ON), and vice-versa.
    
    This commit creates a quirk to not register a RFKill switch at all for
    these laptops, to allow the asus-wireless driver to drive the airplane
    mode LED correctly through the ASHS ACPI device. It also adds a match to
    that quirk for the Asus X555UB, which is affected by this problem.

    net/sched: act_pedit: fix WARN() in the traffic path
    
    [ Upstream commit f67169fef8dbcc1ac6a6a109ecaad0d3b259002c ]
    
    when configuring act_pedit rules, the number of keys is validated only on
    addition of a new entry. This is not sufficient to avoid hitting a WARN()
    in the traffic path: for example, it is possible to replace a valid entry
    with a new one having 0 extended keys, thus causing splats in dmesg like:

    Fix this moving the check on 'nkeys' earlier in tcf_pedit_init(), so that
    attempts to install rules having 0 keys are always rejected with -EINVAL.

    net/mlx4_en: fix mlx4 ethtool -N insertion
    
    [ Upstream commit 34e59836565e36fade1464e054a3551c1a0364be ]
    
    ethtool expects ETHTOOL_GRXCLSRLALL to set ethtool_rxnfc->data with the
    total number of entries in the rx classifier table.  Surprisingly, mlx4
    is missing this part (in principle ethtool could still move forward and
    try the insert).
    
    Tested: compiled and run command:
            phh13:~# ethtool -N eth1 flow-type udp4  queue 4
            Added rule with ID 255
