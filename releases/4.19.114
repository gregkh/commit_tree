    arm64: dts: ls1046ardb: set RGMII interfaces to RGMII_ID mode
    
    commit d79e9d7c1e4ba5f95f2ff3541880c40ea9722212 upstream.
    
    The correct setting for the RGMII ports on LS1046ARDB is to
    enable delay on both Rx and Tx so the interface mode used must
    be PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID.
    
    Since commit 1b3047b5208a80 ("net: phy: realtek: add support for
    configuring the RX delay on RTL8211F") the Realtek 8211F PHY driver
    has control over the RGMII RX delay and it is disabling it for
    RGMII_TXID. The LS1046ARDB uses two such PHYs in RGMII_ID mode but
    in the device tree the mode was described as "rgmii".
    
    Changing the phy-connection-type to "rgmii-id" to address the issue.

    arm64: dts: ls1043a-rdb: correct RGMII delay mode to rgmii-id
    
    commit 4022d808c45277693ea86478fab1f081ebf997e8 upstream.

    in the device tree the mode was described as "rgmii_txid".
    This issue was not apparent at the time as the PHY driver took the
    same action for RGMII_TXID and RGMII_ID back then but it became
    visible (RX no longer working) after the above patch.
    
    Changing the phy-connection-type to "rgmii-id" to address the issue.

    perf map: Fix off by one in strncpy() size argument
    
    commit db2c549407d4a76563c579e4768f7d6d32afefba upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an off-by-one error in strncpy size argument in
    tools/perf/util/map.c. The issue is that in:
    
            strncmp(filename, "/system/lib/", 11)
    
    the passed string literal: "/system/lib/" has 12 bytes (without the NULL
    byte) and the passed size argument is 11. As a result, the logic won't
    match the ending "/" byte and will pass filepaths that are stored in
    other directories e.g. "/system/libmalicious/bin" or just
    "/system/libmalicious".
    
    This functionality seems to be present only on Android. I assume the
    /system/ directory is only writable by the root user, so I don't think
    this bug has much (or any) security impact.

    arm64: alternative: fix build with clang integrated assembler
    
    commit 6f5459da2b8736720afdbd67c4bd2d1edba7d0e3 upstream.
    
    Building an arm64 defconfig with clang's integrated assembler, this error
    occurs:
        <instantiation>:2:2: error: unrecognized instruction mnemonic
         _ASM_EXTABLE 9999b, 9f

        ^
    
    While GNU as seems fine with case-sensitive macro instantiations, clang
    doesn't, so use the actual macro name (_asm_extable) as in the rest of
    the file.
    
    Also checked that the generated assembly matches the GCC output.

    net: ks8851-ml: Fix IO operations, again
    
    commit 8262e6f9b1034ede34548a04dec4c302d92c9497 upstream.
    
    This patch reverts 58292104832f ("net: ks8851-ml: Fix 16-bit IO operation")
    and edacb098ea9c ("net: ks8851-ml: Fix 16-bit data access"), because it
    turns out these were only necessary due to buggy hardware. This patch adds
    a check for such a buggy hardware to prevent any such mistakes again.
    
    While working further on the KS8851 driver, it came to light that the
    KS8851-16MLL is capable of switching bus endianness by a hardware strap,
    EESK pin. If this strap is incorrect, the IO accesses require such endian
    swapping as is being reverted by this patch. Such swapping also impacts
    the performance significantly.
    
    Hence, in addition to removing it, detect that the hardware is broken,
    report to user, and fail to bind with such hardware.

    gpiolib: acpi: Add quirk to ignore EC wakeups on HP x2 10 CHT + AXP288 model
    
    commit 0c625ccfe6f754d0896b8881f5c85bcb81699f1f upstream.
    
    There are at least 3 models of the HP x2 10 models:
    
    Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
    Cherry Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
    Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC
    
    Like on the other HP x2 10 models we need to ignore wakeup for ACPI GPIO
    events on the external embedded-controller pin to avoid spurious wakeups
    on the HP x2 10 CHT + AXP288 model too.
    
    This commit adds an extra DMI based quirk for the HP x2 10 CHT + AXP288
    model, ignoring wakeups for ACPI GPIO events on the EC interrupt pin
    on this model. This fixes spurious wakeups from suspend on this model.

    Trying to initialize a structure with "= {};" will not always clean out
    all padding locations in a structure. So be explicit and call memset to
    initialize everything for a number of bpf information structures that
    are then copied from userspace, sometimes from smaller memory locations
    than the size of the structure.

    bpf: Explicitly memset the bpf_attr structure
    
    commit 8096f229421f7b22433775e928d506f0342e5907 upstream.
    
    For the bpf syscall, we are relying on the compiler to properly zero out
    the bpf_attr union that we copy userspace data into. Unfortunately that
    doesn't always work properly, padding and other oddities might not be
    correctly zeroed, and in some tests odd things have been found when the
    stack is pre-initialized to other values.
    
    Fix this by explicitly memsetting the structure to 0 before using it.

    vt: vt_ioctl: fix use-after-free in vt_in_use()
    
    commit 7cf64b18b0b96e751178b8d0505d8466ff5a448f upstream.
    
    vt_in_use() dereferences console_driver->ttys[i] without proper locking.
    This is broken because the tty can be closed and freed concurrently.
    
    We could fix this by using 'READ_ONCE(console_driver->ttys[i]) != NULL'
    and skipping the check of tty_struct::count.  But, looking at
    console_driver->ttys[i] isn't really appropriate anyway because even if
    it is NULL the tty can still be in the process of being closed.
    
    Instead, fix it by making vt_in_use() require console_lock() and check
    whether the vt is allocated and has port refcount > 1.  This works since
    following the patch "vt: vt_ioctl: fix VT_DISALLOCATE freeing in-use
    virtual console" the port refcount is incremented while the vt is open.
    
    Reproducer (very unreliable, but it worked for me after a few minutes):

    vt: vt_ioctl: fix VT_DISALLOCATE freeing in-use virtual console
    
    commit ca4463bf8438b403596edd0ec961ca0d4fbe0220 upstream.
    
    The VT_DISALLOCATE ioctl can free a virtual console while tty_release()
    is still running, causing a use-after-free in con_shutdown().  This
    occurs because VT_DISALLOCATE considers a virtual console's
    'struct vc_data' to be unused as soon as the corresponding tty's
    refcount hits 0.  But actually it may be still being closed.
    
    Fix this by making vc_data be reference-counted via the embedded
    'struct tty_port'.  A newly allocated virtual console has refcount 1.
    Opening it for the first time increments the refcount to 2.  Closing it
    for the last time decrements the refcount (in tty_operations::cleanup()
    so that it happens late enough), as does VT_DISALLOCATE.
    
    Reproducer:
            #include <fcntl.h>
            #include <linux/vt.h>
            #include <sys/ioctl.h>
            #include <unistd.h>
    
            int main()
            {
                    if (fork()) {
                            for (;;)
                                    close(open("/dev/tty5", O_RDWR));
                    } else {
                            int fd = open("/dev/tty10", O_RDWR);
    
                            for (;;)
                                    ioctl(fd, VT_DISALLOCATE, 5);
                    }

    vt: vt_ioctl: remove unnecessary console allocation checks
    
    commit 1aa6e058dd6cd04471b1f21298270014daf48ac9 upstream.
    
    The vc_cons_allocated() checks in vt_ioctl() and vt_compat_ioctl() are
    unnecessary because they can only be reached by calling ioctl() on an
    open tty, which implies the corresponding virtual console is allocated.
    
    And even if the virtual console *could* be freed concurrently, then
    these checks would be broken since they aren't done under console_lock,
    and the vc_data is dereferenced before them anyway.
    
    So, remove these unneeded checks to avoid confusion.

    because on most drivers the management frames don't go through
    this path. However, they do on iwlwifi/mvm, so we do need to keep
    the condition here.

    commit ce2e1ca703071723ca2dd94d492a5ab6d15050da upstream.
    
    mac80211 used to check port authorization in the Data frame enqueue case
    when going through start_xmit(). However, that authorization status may
    change while the frame is waiting in a queue. Add a similar check in the
    dequeue case to avoid sending previously accepted frames after
    authorization change. This provides additional protection against
    potential leaking of frames after a station has been disconnected and
    the keys for it are being removed.

    libfs: fix infoleak in simple_attr_read()
    
    commit a65cab7d7f05c2061a3e2490257d3086ff3202c6 upstream.
    
    Reading from a debugfs file at a nonzero position, without first reading
    at position 0, leaks uninitialized memory to userspace.
    
    It's a bit tricky to do this, since lseek() and pread() aren't allowed
    on these files, and write() doesn't update the position on them.  But
    writing to them with splice() *does* update the position:
    
            #define _GNU_SOURCE 1
            #include <fcntl.h>
            #include <stdio.h>
            #include <unistd.h>
            int main()
            {
                    int pipes[2], fd, n, i;
                    char buf[32];
    
                    pipe(pipes);
                    write(pipes[1], "0", 1);
                    fd = open("/sys/kernel/debug/fault_around_bytes", O_RDWR);
                    splice(pipes[0], NULL, fd, NULL, 1, 0);
                    n = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
                    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
                            printf("%02x", buf[i]);
                    printf("\n");
            }
    
    Output:
            5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a30
    
    Fix the infoleak by making simple_attr_read() always fill
    simple_attr::get_buf if it hasn't been filled yet.

    commit 1165dd73e811a07d947aee218510571f516081f6 upstream.
    
    We can't handle the case length > WLAN_DATA_MAXLEN.
    Because the size of rxfrm->data is WLAN_DATA_MAXLEN(2312), and we can't
    read more than that.

    media: usbtv: fix control-message timeouts
    
    commit 536f561d871c5781bc33d26d415685211b94032e upstream.
    
    The driver was issuing synchronous uninterruptible control requests
    without using a timeout. This could lead to the driver hanging on
    various user requests due to a malfunctioning (or malicious) device
    until the device is physically disconnected.
    
    The USB upper limit of five seconds per request should be more than
    enough.

    commit 1b976fc6d684 ("media: b2c2-flexcop-usb: add sanity checking") added
    an endpoint sanity check to address a NULL-pointer dereference on probe.
    Unfortunately the check was done on the current altsetting which was later
    changed.
    
    Fix this by moving the sanity check to after the altsetting is changed.

    usb: musb: fix crash with highmen PIO and usbmon
    
    commit 52974d94a206ce428d9d9b6eaa208238024be82a upstream.
    
    When handling a PIO bulk transfer with highmem buffer, a temporary
    mapping is assigned to urb->transfer_buffer.  After the transfer is
    complete, an invalid address is left behind in this pointer.  This is
    not ordinarily a problem since nothing touches that buffer before the
    urb is released.  However, when usbmon is active, usbmon_urb_complete()
    calls (indirectly) mon_bin_get_data() which does access the transfer
    buffer if it is set.  To prevent an invalid memory access here, reset
    urb->transfer_buffer to NULL when finished (musb_host_rx()), or do not
    set it at all (musb_host_tx()).

    vti6: Fix memory leak of skb if input policy check fails
    
    commit 2a9de3af21aa8c31cd68b0b39330d69f8c1e59df upstream.
    
    The vti6_rcv function performs some tests on the retrieved tunnel
    including checking the IP protocol, the XFRM input policy, the
    source and destination address.
    
    In all but one places the skb is released in the error case. When
    the input policy check fails the network packet is leaked.
    
    Using the same goto-label discard in this case to fix this problem.

    bpf/btf: Fix BTF verification of enum members in struct/union
    
    commit da6c7faeb103c493e505e87643272f70be586635 upstream.
    
    btf_enum_check_member() was currently sure to recognize the size of
    "enum" type members in struct/union as the size of "int" even if
    its size was packed.
    
    This patch fixes BTF enum verification to use the correct size
    of member in BPF programs.

    xfrm: fix uctx len check in verify_sec_ctx_len
    
    commit 171d449a028573b2f0acdc7f31ecbb045391b320 upstream.
    
    It's not sufficient to do 'uctx->len != (sizeof(struct xfrm_user_sec_ctx) +
    uctx->ctx_len)' check only, as uctx->len may be greater than nla_len(rt),
    in which case it will cause slab-out-of-bounds when accessing uctx->ctx_str

    This patch is to fix it by return -EINVAL when uctx->len > nla_len(rt).

    genirq: Fix reference leaks on irq affinity notifiers
    
    commit df81dfcfd6991d547653d46c051bac195cd182c1 upstream.
    
    The handling of notify->work did not properly maintain notify->kref in two
     cases:
    1) where the work was already scheduled, another irq_set_affinity_locked()
       would get the ref and (no-op-ly) schedule the work.  Thus when
       irq_affinity_notify() ran, it would drop the original ref but not the
       additional one.
    2) when cancelling the (old) work in irq_set_affinity_notifier(), if there
       was outstanding work a ref had been got for it but was never put.
    Fix both by checking the return values of the work handling functions
     (schedule_work() for (1) and cancel_work_sync() for (2)) and put the
     extra ref if the return value indicates preexisting work.

    RDMA/core: Ensure security pkey modify is not lost
    
    commit 2d47fbacf2725a67869f4d3634c2415e7dfab2f4 upstream.
    
    The following modify sequence (loosely based on ipoib) will lose a pkey
    modifcation:
    
    - Modify (pkey index, port)
    - Modify (new pkey index, NO port)
    
    After the first modify, the qp_pps list will have saved the pkey and the
    unit on the main list.
    
    During the second modify, get_new_pps() will fetch the port from qp_pps
    and read the new pkey index from qp_attr->pkey_index.  The state will
    still be zero, or IB_PORT_PKEY_NOT_VALID. Because of the invalid state,
    the new values will never replace the one in the qp pps list, losing the
    new pkey.
    
    This happens because the following if statements will never correct the
    state because the first term will be false. If the code had been executed,
    it would incorrectly overwrite valid values.
    
      if ((qp_attr_mask & IB_QP_PKEY_INDEX) && (qp_attr_mask & IB_QP_PORT))
              new_pps->main.state = IB_PORT_PKEY_VALID;
    
      if (!(qp_attr_mask & (IB_QP_PKEY_INDEX | IB_QP_PORT)) && qp_pps) {
              new_pps->main.port_num = qp_pps->main.port_num;
              new_pps->main.pkey_index = qp_pps->main.pkey_index;
              if (qp_pps->main.state != IB_PORT_PKEY_NOT_VALID)
                      new_pps->main.state = IB_PORT_PKEY_VALID;
      }
    
    Fix by joining the two if statements with an or test to see if qp_pps is
    non-NULL and in the correct state.

    gpiolib: acpi: Add quirk to ignore EC wakeups on HP x2 10 BYT + AXP288 model
    
    commit 0e91506ba00730f088961a8d39f8693b0f8e3fea upstream.
    
    Commit aa23ca3d98f7 ("gpiolib: acpi: Add honor_wakeup module-option +
    quirk mechanism") was added to deal with spurious wakeups on one specific
    model of the HP x2 10 series. In the mean time I have learned that there
    are at least 3 different HP x2 10 models:
    
    Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
    Cherry Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
    Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC
    
    And the original quirk is only correct for (and only matches the)
    Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC model.
    
    The Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC model has different DMI strings, has
    the external EC interrupt on a different GPIO pin and only needs to ignore
    wakeups on the EC interrupt, the INT0002 device works fine on this model.
    
    This commit adds an extra DMI based quirk for the HP x2 10 BYT + AXP288
    model, ignoring wakeups for ACPI GPIO events on the EC interrupt pin
    on this model. This fixes spurious wakeups from suspend on this model.

    gpiolib: acpi: Rework honor_wakeup option into an ignore_wake option
    
    commit 2ccb21f5516afef5e251184eeefbf36db90206d7 upstream.
    
    Commit aa23ca3d98f7 ("gpiolib: acpi: Add honor_wakeup module-option +
    quirk mechanism") was added to deal with spurious wakeups on one specific
    model of the HP x2 10 series.
    
    The approach taken there was to add a bool controlling wakeup support for
    all ACPI GPIO events. This was sufficient for the specific HP x2 10 model
    the commit was trying to fix, but in the mean time other models have
    turned up which need a similar workaround to avoid spurious wakeups from
    suspend, but only for one of the pins on which the ACPI tables request
    ACPI GPIO events.
    
    Since the honor_wakeup option was added to be able to ignore wake events,
    the name was perhaps not the best, this commit renames it to ignore_wake
    and changes it to a string with the following format:
    gpiolib_acpi.ignore_wake=controller@pin[,controller@pin[,...]]
    
    This allows working around spurious wakeup issues on a per pin basis.
    
    This commit also reworks the existing quirk for the HP x2 10 so that
    it functions as before.
    
    Note:
    -This removes the honor_wakeup parameter. This has only been upstream for
     a short time and to the best of my knowledge there are no users using
     this module parameter.
    
    -The controller@pin[,controller@pin[,...]] syntax is based on an existing
     kernel module parameter using the same controller@pin format. That version
     uses ';' as separator, but in practice that is problematic because grub2
     cannot handle this without taking special care to escape the ';', so here
     we are using a ',' as separator instead which does not have this issue.

    gpiolib: acpi: Correct comment for HP x2 10 honor_wakeup quirk
    
    commit efaa87fa0947d525cf7c075316adde4e3ac7720b upstream.
    
    Commit aa23ca3d98f7 ("gpiolib: acpi: Add honor_wakeup module-option +
    quirk mechanism") added a quirk for some models of the HP x2 10 series.
    
    There are 2 issues with the comment describing the quirk:
    1) The comment claims the DMI quirk applies to all Cherry Trail based HP x2
       10 models. In the mean time I have learned that there are at least 3
       models of the HP x2 10 models:
    
       Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
       Cherry Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
       Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC
    
       And this quirk's DMI matches only match the Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC
       SoC, which is good because we want a slightly different quirk for the
       others. This commit updates the comment to make it clear that the quirk
       is only for the Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC models.
    
    2) The comment says that it is ok to disable wakeup on all ACPI GPIO event
       handlers, because there is only the one for the embedded-controller
       events. This is not true, there also is a handler for the special
       INT0002 device which is related to USB wakeups. We need to also disable
       wakeups on that one because the device turns of the USB-keyboard built
       into the dock when closing the lid. The XHCI controller takes a while
       to notice this, so it only notices it when already suspended, causing
       a spurious wakeup because of this. So disabling wakeup on all handlers
       is the right thing to do, but not because there only is the one handler
       for the EC events. This commit updates the comment to correctly reflect
       this.

    mac80211: mark station unauthorized before key removal
    
    commit b16798f5b907733966fd1a558fca823b3c67e4a1 upstream.
    
    If a station is still marked as authorized, mark it as no longer
    so before removing its keys. This allows frames transmitted to it
    to be rejected, providing additional protection against leaking
    plain text data during the disconnection flow.

    The new opmode notification used this attribute with a u8, when
    it's documented as a u32 and indeed used in userspace as such,
    it just happens to work on little-endian systems since userspace

    scsi: sd: Fix optimal I/O size for devices that change reported values
    
    commit ea697a8bf5a4161e59806fab14f6e4a46dc7dcb0 upstream.
    
    Some USB bridge devices will return a default set of characteristics during
    initialization. And then, once an attached drive has spun up, substitute
    the actual parameters reported by the drive. According to the SCSI spec,
    the device should return a UNIT ATTENTION in case any reported parameters
    change. But in this case the change is made silently after a small window
    where default values are reported.
    
    Commit a83da8a4509d ("scsi: sd: Optimal I/O size should be a multiple of
    physical block size") validated the reported optimal I/O size against the
    physical block size to overcome problems with devices reporting nonsensical
    transfer sizes. However, this validation did not account for the fact that
    aforementioned devices will return default values during a brief window
    during spin-up. The subsequent change in reported characteristics would
    invalidate the checking that had previously been performed.
    
    Unset a previously configured optimal I/O size should the sanity checking
    fail on subsequent revalidate attempts.

    scripts/dtc: Remove redundant YYLOC global declaration
    
    commit e33a814e772cdc36436c8c188d8c42d019fda639 upstream.
    
    gcc 10 will default to -fno-common, which causes this error at link
    time:
    
      (.text+0x0): multiple definition of `yylloc'; dtc-lexer.lex.o (symbol from plugin):(.text+0x0): first defined here
    
    This is because both dtc-lexer as well as dtc-parser define the same
    global symbol yyloc. Before with -fcommon those were merged into one
    defintion. The proper solution would be to to mark this as "extern",
    however that leads to:
    
      dtc-lexer.l:26:16: error: redundant redeclaration of 'yylloc' [-Werror=redundant-decls]
       26 | extern YYLTYPE yylloc;
          |                ^~~~~~
    In file included from dtc-lexer.l:24:
    dtc-parser.tab.h:127:16: note: previous declaration of 'yylloc' was here

          |                ^~~~~~
    cc1: all warnings being treated as errors
    
    which means the declaration is completely redundant and can just be
    dropped.

    tools: Let O= makes handle a relative path with -C option
    
    commit be40920fbf1003c38ccdc02b571e01a75d890c82 upstream.
    
    When I tried to compile tools/perf from the top directory with the -C
    option, the O= option didn't work correctly if I passed a relative path:
    
      $ make O=BUILD -C tools/perf/
      make: Entering directory '/home/mhiramat/ksrc/linux/tools/perf'
        BUILD:   Doing 'make -j8' parallel build
      ../scripts/Makefile.include:4: *** O=/home/mhiramat/ksrc/linux/tools/perf/BUILD does not exist.  Stop.
      make: *** [Makefile:70: all] Error 2
      make: Leaving directory '/home/mhiramat/ksrc/linux/tools/perf'
    
    The O= directory existence check failed because the check script ran in
    the build target directory instead of the directory where I ran the make
    command.
    
    To fix that, once change directory to $(PWD) and check O= directory,
    since the PWD is set to where the make command runs.

    commit 1efde2754275dbd9d11c6e0132a4f09facf297ab upstream.

    07d369857808 ("perf probe: Fix wrong address verification) reverted to
    get actual symbol address from symtab.
    
    This fixes it again by getting symbol address from DIE, and only if the
    DIE has only address range, it uses dwfl_module_addrsym().

    Add the dma-ranges property to reflect the physical address limit

    Issues ere observed only with SATA on DRA7-EVM with 4GB RAM
    and CONFIG_ARM_LPAE enabled. This is because the controller
    supports 64-bit DMA and its driver sets the dma_mask to 64-bit
    thus resulting in DMA accesses beyond L3 limit of 2G.
    
    Setting the correct bus_dma_limit fixes the issue.

    ceph: check POOL_FLAG_FULL/NEARFULL in addition to OSDMAP_FULL/NEARFULL
    
    commit 7614209736fbc4927584d4387faade4f31444fce upstream.
    
    CEPH_OSDMAP_FULL/NEARFULL aren't set since mimic, so we need to consult
    per-pool flags as well.  Unfortunately the backwards compatibility here
    is lacking:
    
    - the change that deprecated OSDMAP_FULL/NEARFULL went into mimic, but
      was guarded by require_osd_release >= RELEASE_LUMINOUS
    - it was subsequently backported to luminous in v12.2.2, but that makes
      no difference to clients that only check OSDMAP_FULL/NEARFULL because
      require_osd_release is not client-facing -- it is for OSDs
    
    Since all kernels are affected, the best we can do here is just start
    checking both map flags and pool flags and send that to stable.
    
    These checks are best effort, so take osdc->lock and look up pool flags
    just once.  Remove the FIXME, since filesystem quotas are checked above
    and RADOS quotas are reflected in POOL_FLAG_FULL: when the pool reaches
    its quota, both POOL_FLAG_FULL and POOL_FLAG_FULL_QUOTA are set.

    ftrace/x86: Anotate text_mutex split between ftrace_arch_code_modify_post_process() and ftrace_arch_code_modify_prepare()
    
    commit 074376ac0e1d1fcd4fafebca86ee6158e7c20680 upstream.
    
    ftrace_arch_code_modify_prepare() is acquiring text_mutex, while the
    corresponding release is happening in ftrace_arch_code_modify_post_process().
    
    This has already been documented in the code, but let's also make the fact
    that this is intentional clear to the semantic analysis tools such as sparse.

    sxgbe: Fix off by one in samsung driver strncpy size arg
    
    [ Upstream commit f3cc008bf6d59b8d93b4190e01d3e557b0040e15 ]
    
    This patch fixes an off-by-one error in strncpy size argument in
    drivers/net/ethernet/samsung/sxgbe/sxgbe_main.c. The issue is that in:
    
            strncmp(opt, "eee_timer:", 6)
    
    the passed string literal: "eee_timer:" has 10 bytes (without the NULL
    byte) and the passed size argument is 6. As a result, the logic will
    also accept other, malformed strings, e.g. "eee_tiXXX:".
    
    This bug doesn't seem to have any security impact since its present in
    module's cmdline parsing code.

    As a part of the scan process Linux will allocate and configure a
    scsi_device for each target to be scanned. If the device is not present,
    then the scsi_device is torn down. As a part of scsi_device teardown a
    workqueue item will be scheduled and the lockups we see are because there
    are 250k workqueue items to be processed.  Accoding to the specification of
    SIS-64 sas controller, max_channel should be decreased on SIS-64 adapters
    to 4.
    
    The patch fixes softlockup issue.
    
    Thanks for Oliver Halloran's help with debugging and explanation!

    dt-bindings: net: FMan erratum A050385
    
    [ Upstream commit 26d5bb9e4c4b541c475751e015072eb2cbf70d15 ]
    
    FMAN DMA read or writes under heavy traffic load may cause FMAN
    internal resource leak; thus stopping further packet processing.
    
    The FMAN internal queue can overflow when FMAN splits single
    read or write transactions into multiple smaller transactions
    such that more than 17 AXI transactions are in flight from FMAN
    to interconnect. When the FMAN internal queue overflows, it can
    stall further packet processing. The issue can occur with any one
    of the following three conditions:
    
      1. FMAN AXI transaction crosses 4K address boundary (Errata
         A010022)
      2. FMAN DMA address for an AXI transaction is not 16 byte
         aligned, i.e. the last 4 bits of an address are non-zero
      3. Scatter Gather (SG) frames have more than one SG buffer in
         the SG list and any one of the buffers, except the last
         buffer in the SG list has data size that is not a multiple
         of 16 bytes, i.e., other than 16, 32, 48, 64, etc.
    
    With any one of the above three conditions present, there is
    likelihood of stalled FMAN packet processing, especially under
    stress with multiple ports injecting line-rate traffic.
    
    To avoid situations that stall FMAN packet processing, all of the
    above three conditions must be avoided; therefore, configure the
    system with the following rules:
    
      1. Frame buffers must not span a 4KB address boundary, unless
         the frame start address is 256 byte aligned
      2. All FMAN DMA start addresses (for example, BMAN buffer
         address, FD[address] + FD[offset]) are 16B aligned
      3. SG table and buffer addresses are 16B aligned and the size
         of SG buffers are multiple of 16 bytes, except for the last
         SG buffer that can be of any size.
    
    Additional workaround notes:
    - Address alignment of 64 bytes is recommended for maximally
    efficient system bus transactions (although 16 byte alignment is
    sufficient to avoid the stall condition)
    - To support frame sizes that are larger than 4K bytes, there are
    two options:
      1. Large single buffer frames that span a 4KB page boundary can
         be converted into SG frames to avoid transaction splits at
         the 4KB boundary,
      2. Align the large single buffer to 256B address boundaries,
         ensure that the frame address plus offset is 256B aligned.
    - If software generated SG frames have buffers that are unaligned
    and with random non-multiple of 16 byte lengths, before
    transmitting such frames via FMAN, frames will need to be copied
    into a new single buffer or multiple buffer SG frame that is
    compliant with the three rules listed above.

    cgroup1: don't call release_agent when it is ""
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e5383d7904e60529136727e49629a82058a5607 ]
    
    Older (and maybe current) versions of systemd set release_agent to "" when
    shutting down, but do not set notify_on_release to 0.
    
    Since 64e90a8acb85 ("Introduce STATIC_USERMODEHELPER to mediate
    call_usermodehelper()"), we filter out such calls when the user mode helper
    path is "". However, when used in conjunction with an actual (i.e. non "")
    STATIC_USERMODEHELPER, the path is never "", so the real usermode helper
    will be called with argv[0] == "".
    
    Let's avoid this by not invoking the release_agent when it is "".

    nfs: add minor version to nfs_server_key for fscache
    
    [ Upstream commit 55dee1bc0d72877b99805e42e0205087e98b9edd ]
    
    An NFS client that mounts multiple exports from the same NFS
    server with higher NFSv4 versions disabled (i.e. 4.2) and without
    forcing a specific NFS version results in fscache index cookie
    collisions and the following messages:
    [  570.004348] FS-Cache: Duplicate cookie detected
    
    Each nfs_client structure should have its own fscache index cookie,
    so add the minorversion to nfs_server_key.

    hsr: set .netnsok flag
    
    [ Upstream commit 09e91dbea0aa32be02d8877bd50490813de56b9a ]
    
    The hsr module has been supporting the list and status command.
    (HSR_C_GET_NODE_LIST and HSR_C_GET_NODE_STATUS)
    These commands send node information to the user-space via generic netlink.
    But, in the non-init_net namespace, these commands are not allowed
    because .netnsok flag is false.
    So, there is no way to get node information in the non-init_net namespace.

    [ Upstream commit 173756b86803655d70af7732079b3aa935e6ab68 ]
    
    hsr_get_node_{list/status}() are not under rtnl_lock() because
    they are callback functions of generic netlink.
    But they use __dev_get_by_index() without rtnl_lock().
    So, it would use unsafe data.

    are used instead of __dev_get_by_index().

    tcp: repair: fix TCP_QUEUE_SEQ implementation
    
    [ Upstream commit 6cd6cbf593bfa3ae6fc3ed34ac21da4d35045425 ]
    
    When application uses TCP_QUEUE_SEQ socket option to
    change tp->rcv_next, we must also update tp->copied_seq.
    
    Otherwise, stuff relying on tcp_inq() being precise can
    eventually be confused.
    
    For example, tcp_zerocopy_receive() might crash because
    it does not expect tcp_recv_skb() to return NULL.
    
    We could add tests in various places to fix the issue,
    or simply make sure tcp_inq() wont return a random value,
    and leave fast path as it is.
    
    Note that this fixes ioctl(fd, SIOCINQ, &val) at the same
    time.

    net: dsa: mt7530: Change the LINK bit to reflect the link status
    
    [ Upstream commit 22259471b51925353bd7b16f864c79fdd76e425e ]
    
    Andrew reported:
    
    After a number of network port link up/down changes, sometimes the switch
    port gets stuck in a state where it thinks it is still transmitting packets
    but the cpu port is not actually transmitting anymore. In this state you
    will see a message on the console
    "mtk_soc_eth 1e100000.ethernet eth0: transmit timed out" and the Tx counter
    in ifconfig will be incrementing on virtual port, but not incrementing on
    cpu port.
    
    The issue is that MAC TX/RX status has no impact on the link status or
    queue manager of the switch. So the queue manager just queues up packets
    of a disabled port and sends out pause frames when the queue is full.
    
    Change the LINK bit to reflect the link status.

    net: ip_gre: Separate ERSPAN newlink / changelink callbacks
    
    [ Upstream commit e1f8f78ffe9854308b9e12a73ebe4e909074fc33 ]
    
    ERSPAN shares most of the code path with GRE and gretap code. While that
    helps keep the code compact, it is also error prone. Currently a broken
    userspace can turn a gretap tunnel into a de facto ERSPAN one by passing
    IFLA_GRE_ERSPAN_VER. There has been a similar issue in ip6gretap in the
    past.
    
    To prevent these problems in future, split the newlink and changelink code
    paths. Split the ERSPAN code out of ipgre_netlink_parms() into a new
    function erspan_netlink_parms(). Extract a piece of common logic from
    ipgre_newlink() and ipgre_changelink() into ipgre_newlink_encap_setup().
    Add erspan_newlink() and erspan_changelink().

    [ Upstream commit ef299cc3fa1a9e1288665a9fdc8bff55629fd359 ]
    
    route4_change() allocates a new filter and copies values from

    table, the old filter should be removed and freed, as the final
    step of the update.
    
    However, the current code mistakenly removes the new one. This
    looks apparently wrong to me, and it causes double "free" and
    use-after-free too, as reported by syzbot.

    net/packet: tpacket_rcv: avoid a producer race condition
    
    [ Upstream commit 61fad6816fc10fb8793a925d5c1256d1c3db0cd2 ]
    
    PACKET_RX_RING can cause multiple writers to access the same slot if a
    fast writer wraps the ring while a slow writer is still copying. This
    is particularly likely with few, large, slots (e.g., GSO packets).
    
    Synchronize kernel thread ownership of rx ring slots with a bitmap.
    
    Writers acquire a slot race-free by testing tp_status TP_STATUS_KERNEL
    while holding the sk receive queue lock. They release this lock before
    copying and set tp_status to TP_STATUS_USER to release to userspace
    when done. During copying, another writer may take the lock, also see
    TP_STATUS_KERNEL, and start writing to the same slot.
    
    Introduce a new rx_owner_map bitmap with a bit per slot. To acquire a
    slot, test and set with the lock held. To release race-free, update
    tp_status and owner bit as a transaction, so take the lock again.
    
    This is the one of a variety of discussed options (see Link below):
    
    * instead of a shadow ring, embed the data in the slot itself, such as
    in tp_padding. But any test for this field may match a value left by
    userspace, causing deadlock.
    
    * avoid the lock on release. This leaves a small race if releasing the
    shadow slot before setting TP_STATUS_USER. The below reproducer showed
    that this race is not academic. If releasing the slot after tp_status,
    the race is more subtle. See the first link for details.
    
    * add a new tp_status TP_KERNEL_OWNED to avoid the transactional store
    of two fields. But, legacy applications may interpret all non-zero
    tp_status as owned by the user. As libpcap does. So this is possible
    only opt-in by newer processes. It can be added as an optional mode.
    
    * embed the struct at the tail of pg_vec to avoid extra allocation.
    The implementation proved no less complex than a separate field.
    
    The additional locking cost on release adds contention, no different
    than scaling on multicore or multiqueue h/w. In practice, below
    reproducer nor small packet tcpdump showed a noticeable change in
    perf report in cycles spent in spinlock. Where contention is
    problematic, packet sockets support mitigation through PACKET_FANOUT.
    And we can consider adding opt-in state TP_KERNEL_OWNED.
    
    Easy to reproduce by running multiple netperf or similar TCP_STREAM
    flows concurrently with `tcpdump -B 129 -n greater 60000`.
    
    Based on an earlier patchset by Jon Rosen. See links below.
    
    I believe this issue goes back to the introduction of tpacket_rcv,
    which predates git history.

    net: cbs: Fix software cbs to consider packet sending time
    
    [ Upstream commit 961d0e5b32946703125964f9f5b6321d60f4d706 ]
    
    Currently the software CBS does not consider the packet sending time
    when depleting the credits. It caused the throughput to be
    Idleslope[kbps] * (Port transmit rate[kbps] / |Sendslope[kbps]|) where
    Idleslope * (Port transmit rate / (Idleslope + |Sendslope|)) = Idleslope
    is expected. In order to fix the issue above, this patch takes the time
    when the packet sending completes into account by moving the anchor time
    variable "last" ahead to the send completion time upon transmission and
    adding wait when the next dequeue request comes before the send
    completion time of the previous packet.
    
    changelog:
    V2->V3:
     - remove unnecessary whitespace cleanup
     - add the checks if port_rate is 0 before division
    
    V1->V2:
     - combine variable "send_completed" into "last"
     - add the comment for estimate of the packet sending

    list_for_each_entry_from_reverse() iterates backwards over the list from

    hsr: fix general protection fault in hsr_addr_is_self()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a303cfdd28d5f930a307c82e8a9d996394d5ebd ]
    
    The port->hsr is used in the hsr_handle_frame(), which is a
    callback of rx_handler.
    hsr master and slaves are initialized in hsr_add_port().
    This function initializes several pointers, which includes port->hsr after
    registering rx_handler.
    So, in the rx_handler routine, un-initialized pointer would be used.
    In order to fix this, pointers should be initialized before
    registering rx_handler.

    geneve: move debug check after netdev unregister
    
    [ Upstream commit 0fda7600c2e174fe27e9cf02e78e345226e441fa ]
    
    The debug check must be done after unregister_netdevice_many() call --
    the list_del() for this is done inside .ndo_stop.

    Revert "drm/dp_mst: Skip validating ports during destruction, just ref"
    
    commit 9765635b30756eb74e05e260ac812659c296cd28 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit:
    
    c54c7374ff44 ("drm/dp_mst: Skip validating ports during destruction, just ref")
    
    ugh.
    
    In drm_dp_destroy_connector_work(), we have a pretty good chance of
    freeing the actual struct drm_dp_mst_port. However, after destroying
    things we send a hotplug through (*mgr->cbs->hotplug)(mgr) which is
    where the problems start.
    
    For i915, this calls all the way down to the fbcon probing helpers,
    which start trying to access the port in a modeset.

    So, this definitely isn't a fix that we want. This being said; there's
    no real easy fix for this problem because of some of the catch-22's of
    the MST helpers current design. For starters; we always need to validate
    a port with drm_dp_get_validated_port_ref(), but validation relies on
    the lifetime of the port in the actual topology. So once the port is
    gone, it can't be validated again.
    
    If we were to try to make the payload helpers not use port validation,
    then we'd cause another problem: if the port isn't validated, it could
    be freed and we'd just start causing more KASAN issues. There are
    already hacks that attempt to workaround this in
    drm_dp_mst_destroy_connector_work() by re-initializing the kref so that
    it can be used again and it's memory can be freed once the VCPI helpers
    finish removing the port's respective payloads. But none of these really
    do anything helpful since the port still can't be validated since it's
    gone from the topology. Also, that workaround is immensely confusing to
    read through.
    
    What really needs to be done in order to fix this is to teach DRM how to
    track the lifetime of the structs for MST ports and branch devices
    separately from their lifetime in the actual topology. Simply put; this
    means having two different krefs-one that removes the port/branch device
    from the topology, and one that finally calls kfree(). This would let us
    simplify things, since we'd now be able to keep ports around without
    having to keep them in the topology at the same time, which is exactly
    what we need in order to teach our VCPI helpers to only validate ports
    when it's actually necessary without running the risk of trying to use
    unallocated memory.
    
    Such a fix is on it's way, but for now let's play it safe and just
    revert this. If this bug has been around for well over a year, we can
    wait a little while to get an actual proper fix here.

    mmc: sdhci-tegra: Fix busy detection by enabling MMC_CAP_NEED_RSP_BUSY
    
    [ Upstream commit d2f8bfa4bff5028bc40ed56b4497c32e05b0178f ]
    
    It has turned out that the sdhci-tegra controller requires the R1B response,
    for commands that has this response associated with them. So, converting
    from an R1B to an R1 response for a CMD6 for example, leads to problems
    with the HW busy detection support.
    
    Fix this by informing the mmc core about the requirement, via setting the
    host cap, MMC_CAP_NEED_RSP_BUSY.

    mmc: core: Respect MMC_CAP_NEED_RSP_BUSY for eMMC sleep command
    
    [ Upstream commit 18d200460cd73636d4f20674085c39e32b4e0097 ]
    
    The busy timeout for the CMD5 to put the eMMC into sleep state, is specific
    to the card. Potentially the timeout may exceed the host->max_busy_timeout.
    If that becomes the case, mmc_sleep() converts from using an R1B response
    to an R1 response, as to prevent the host from doing HW busy detection.
    
    However, it has turned out that some hosts requires an R1B response no
    matter what, so let's respect that via checking MMC_CAP_NEED_RSP_BUSY. Note
    that, if the R1B gets enforced, the host becomes fully responsible of
    managing the needed busy timeout, in one way or the other.

    mmc: core: Respect MMC_CAP_NEED_RSP_BUSY for erase/trim/discard
    
    [ Upstream commit 43cc64e5221cc6741252b64bc4531dd1eefb733d ]
    
    The busy timeout that is computed for each erase/trim/discard operation,
    can become quite long and may thus exceed the host->max_busy_timeout. If
    that becomes the case, mmc_do_erase() converts from using an R1B response
    to an R1 response, as to prevent the host from doing HW busy detection.
    
    However, it has turned out that some hosts requires an R1B response no
    matter what, so let's respect that via checking MMC_CAP_NEED_RSP_BUSY. Note
    that, if the R1B gets enforced, the host becomes fully responsible of
    managing the needed busy timeout, in one way or the other.

    mmc: core: Allow host controllers to require R1B for CMD6
    
    [ Upstream commit 1292e3efb149ee21d8d33d725eeed4e6b1ade963 ]
    
    It has turned out that some host controllers can't use R1B for CMD6 and
    other commands that have R1B associated with them. Therefore invent a new
    host cap, MMC_CAP_NEED_RSP_BUSY to let them specify this.
    
    In __mmc_switch(), let's check the flag and use it to prevent R1B responses
    from being converted into R1. Note that, this also means that the host are
    on its own, when it comes to manage the busy timeout.
