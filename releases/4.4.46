    mm, memcg: do not retry precharge charges
    
    commit 3674534b775354516e5c148ea48f51d4d1909a78 upstream.
    
    When memory.move_charge_at_immigrate is enabled and precharges are
    depleted during move, mem_cgroup_move_charge_pte_range() will attempt to
    increase the size of the precharge.
    
    Prevent precharges from ever looping by setting __GFP_NORETRY.  This was
    probably the intention of the GFP_KERNEL & ~__GFP_NORETRY, which is
    pointless as written.

    IB/ipoib: move back IB LL address into the hard header
    
    commit fc791b6335152c5278dc4a4991bcb2d329f806f9 upstream.
    
    After the commit 9207f9d45b0a ("net: preserve IP control block
    during GSO segmentation"), the GSO CB and the IPoIB CB conflict.
    That destroy the IPoIB address information cached there,
    causing a severe performance regression, as better described here:
    
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=146787279825501&w=2
    
    This change moves the data cached by the IPoIB driver from the
    skb control lock into the IPoIB hard header, as done before
    the commit 936d7de3d736 ("IPoIB: Stop lying about hard_header_len
    and use skb->cb to stash LL addresses").
    In order to avoid GRO issue, on packet reception, the IPoIB driver
    stash into the skb a dummy pseudo header, so that the received
    packets have actually a hard header matching the declared length.
    To avoid changing the connected mode maximum mtu, the allocated
    head buffer size is increased by the pseudo header length.
    
    After this commit, IPoIB performances are back to pre-regression
    value.
    
    v2 -> v3: rebased
    v1 -> v2: avoid changing the max mtu, increasing the head buf size

    nfs: Don't increment lock sequence ID after NFS4ERR_MOVED
    
    commit 059aa734824165507c65fd30a55ff000afd14983 upstream.
    
    Xuan Qi reports that the Linux NFSv4 client failed to lock a file
    that was migrated. The steps he observed on the wire:
    
    1. The client sent a LOCK request to the source server
    2. The source server replied NFS4ERR_MOVED
    3. The client switched to the destination server
    4. The client sent the same LOCK request to the destination
       server with a bumped lock sequence ID
    5. The destination server rejected the LOCK request with
       NFS4ERR_BAD_SEQID
    
    RFC 3530 section 8.1.5 provides a list of NFS errors which do not
    bump a lock sequence ID.
    
    However, RFC 3530 is now obsoleted by RFC 7530. In RFC 7530 section
    9.1.7, this list has been updated by the addition of NFS4ERR_MOVED.

    parisc: Don't use BITS_PER_LONG in userspace-exported swab.h header
    
    commit 2ad5d52d42810bed95100a3d912679d8864421ec upstream.
    
    In swab.h the "#if BITS_PER_LONG > 32" breaks compiling userspace programs if
    BITS_PER_LONG is #defined by userspace with the sizeof() compiler builtin.
    
    Solve this problem by using __BITS_PER_LONG instead.  Since we now
    #include asm/bitsperlong.h avoid further potential userspace pollution
    by moving the #define of SHIFT_PER_LONG to bitops.h which is not
    exported to userspace.

    ARC: [arcompact] handle unaligned access delay slot corner case
    
    commit 9aed02feae57bf7a40cb04ea0e3017cb7a998db4 upstream.
    
    After emulating an unaligned access in delay slot of a branch, we
    pretend as the delay slot never happened - so return back to actual
    branch target (or next PC if branch was not taken).
    
    Curently we did this by handling STATUS32.DE, we also need to clear the
    BTA.T bit, which is disregarded when returning from original misaligned
    exception, but could cause weirdness if it took the interrupt return
    path (in case interrupt was acive too)
    
    One ARC700 customer ran into this when enabling unaligned access fixup
    for kernel mode accesses as well

    ARC: udelay: fix inline assembler by adding LP_COUNT to clobber list
    
    commit 36425cd67052e3becf325fd4d3ba5691791ef7e4 upstream.
    
    commit 3c7c7a2fc8811bc ("ARC: Don't use "+l" inline asm constraint")
    modified the inline assembly to setup LP_COUNT register manually and NOT
    rely on gcc to do it (with the +l inline assembler contraint hint, now
    being retired in the compiler)
    
    However the fix was flawed as we didn't add LP_COUNT to asm clobber list,
    meaning gcc doesn't know that LP_COUNT or zero-delay-loops are in action
    in the inline asm.
    
    This resulted in some fun - as nested ZOL loops were being generared
    
    | mov lp_count,250000 ;16 # tmp235,
    | lp .L__GCC__LP14 #            <======= OUTER LOOP (gcc generated)
    |   .L14:
    |   ld r2, [r5] # MEM[(volatile u32 *)prephitmp_43], w
    |   dmb 1
    |   breq r2, -1, @.L21 #, w,,
    |   bbit0 r2,1,@.L13 # w,,
    |   ld r4,[r7] ;25 # loops_per_jiffy, loops_per_jiffy
    |   mpymu r3,r4,r6 #, loops_per_jiffy, tmp234
    |
    |   mov lp_count, r3 #           <====== INNER LOOP (from inline asm)

    |        nop
    |   1:
    |   nop_s
    | .L__GCC__LP14: ; loop end, start is @.L14 #,
    
    This caused issues with drivers relying on sane behaviour of udelay
    friends.
    
    With LP_COUNT added to clobber list, gcc doesn't generate the outer
    loop in say above case.

    commit c97c52be78b8463ac5407f1cf1f22f8f6cf93a37 upstream.
    
    The priv->device pointer for c_can_pci is never set, but it is used
    without a NULL check in c_can_start(). Setting it in c_can_pci_probe()
    like c_can_plat_probe() prevents c_can_pci.ko from crashing, with and
    without CONFIG_PM.
    
    This might also cause the pm_runtime_*() functions in c_can.c to
    actually be executed for c_can_pci devices - they are the only other
    place where priv->device is used, but they all contain a null check.

    RDMA/cma: Fix unknown symbol when CONFIG_IPV6 is not enabled
    
    commit b4cfe3971f6eab542dd7ecc398bfa1aeec889934 upstream.
    
    If IPV6 has not been enabled in the underlying kernel, we must avoid
    calling IPV6 procedures in rdma_cm.ko.
    
    This requires using "IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6)" in "if" statements
    surrounding any code which calls external IPV6 procedures.
    
    In the instance fixed here, procedure cma_bind_addr() called
    ipv6_addr_type() -- which resulted in calling external procedure
    __ipv6_addr_type().

    ISDN: eicon: silence misleading array-bounds warning
    
    commit 950eabbd6ddedc1b08350b9169a6a51b130ebaaf upstream.
    
    With some gcc versions, we get a warning about the eicon driver,
    and that currently shows up as the only remaining warning in one
    of the build bots:
    
    In file included from ../drivers/isdn/hardware/eicon/message.c:30:0:
    eicon/message.c: In function 'mixer_notify_update':
    eicon/platform.h:333:18: warning: array subscript is above array bounds [-Warray-bounds]
    
    The code is easily changed to open-code the unusual PUT_WORD() line
    causing this to avoid the warning.

    commit ff9f8a7cf935468a94d9927c68b00daae701667e upstream.
    
    We perform the conversion between kernel jiffies and ms only when
    exporting kernel value to user space.
    
    We need to do the opposite operation when value is written by user.

    mm/mempolicy.c: do not put mempolicy before using its nodemask
    
    commit d51e9894d27492783fc6d1b489070b4ba66ce969 upstream.
    
    Since commit be97a41b291e ("mm/mempolicy.c: merge alloc_hugepage_vma to
    alloc_pages_vma") alloc_pages_vma() can potentially free a mempolicy by
    mpol_cond_put() before accessing the embedded nodemask by
    __alloc_pages_nodemask().  The commit log says it's so "we can use a
    single exit path within the function" but that's clearly wrong.  We can
    still do that when doing mpol_cond_put() after the allocation attempt.
    
    Make sure the mempolicy is not freed prematurely, otherwise
    __alloc_pages_nodemask() can end up using a bogus nodemask, which could
    lead e.g.  to premature OOM.
    
    Fixes: be97a41b291e ("mm/mempolicy.c: merge alloc_hugepage_vma to alloc_pages_vma")

    drm: Fix broken VT switch with video=1366x768 option
    
    commit fdf35a6b22247746a7053fc764d04218a9306f82 upstream.
    
    I noticed that the VT switch doesn't work any longer with a Dell
    laptop with 1366x768 eDP when the machine is connected with a DP
    monitor.  It behaves as if VT were switched, but the graphics remain
    frozen.  Actually the keyboard works, so I could switch back to VT7
    again.
    
    I tried to track down the problem, and encountered a long story until
    we reach to this error:
    
    - The machine is booted with video=1366x768 option (the distro
      installer seems to add it as default).
    - Recently, drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes() deals with
      cmdline modes, and it tries to create a new mode when no
      matching mode is found.
    - The drm_mode_create_from_cmdline_mode() creates a mode based on
      either CVT of GFT according to the given cmdline mode; in our case,
      it's 1366x768.
    - Since both CVT and GFT can't express the width 1366 due to
      alignment, the resultant mode becomes 1368x768, slightly larger than
      the given size.
    - Later on, the atomic commit is performed, and in
      drm_atomic_check_only(), the size of each plane is checked.
    - The size check of 1366x768 fails due to the above, and eventually
      the whole VT switch fails.
    
    Back in the history, we've had a manual fix-up of 1368x768 in various
    places via c09dedb7a50e ("drm/edid: Add a workaround for 1366x768 HD
    panel"), but they have been all in drm_edid.c at probing the modes
    from EDID.  For addressing the problem above, we need a similar hack
    to the mode newly created from cmdline, manually adjusting the width
    when the expected size is 1366 while we get 1368 instead.

    fbdev: color map copying bounds checking
    
    commit 2dc705a9930b4806250fbf5a76e55266e59389f2 upstream.
    
    Copying color maps to userspace doesn't check the value of to->start,
    which will cause kernel heap buffer OOB read due to signedness wraps.
