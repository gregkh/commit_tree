    regmap: debugfs: Fix a reversed if statement in regmap_debugfs_init()
    
    commit f6bcb4c7f366905b66ce8ffca7190118244bb642 upstream.
    
    This code will leak "map->debugfs_name" because the if statement is
    reversed so it only frees NULL pointers instead of non-NULL.  In
    fact the if statement is not required and should just be removed
    because kfree() accepts NULL pointers.

    net: drop bogus skb with CHECKSUM_PARTIAL and offset beyond end of trimmed packet
    
    commit 54970a2fbb673f090b7f02d7f57b10b2e0707155 upstream.
    
    syzbot reproduces BUG_ON in skb_checksum_help():
    tun creates (bogus) skb with huge partial-checksummed area and
    small ip packet inside. Then ip_rcv trims the skb based on size
    of internal ip packet, after that csum offset points beyond of
    trimmed skb. Then checksum_tg() called via netfilter hook
    triggers BUG_ON:
    
            offset = skb_checksum_start_offset(skb);
            BUG_ON(offset >= skb_headlen(skb));
    
    To work around the problem this patch forces pskb_trim_rcsum_slow()
    to return -EINVAL in described scenario. It allows its callers to
    drop such kind of packets.

    KVM: arm64: Don't access PMCR_EL0 when no PMU is available
    
    commit 2a5f1b67ec577fb1544b563086e0377f095f88e2 upstream.
    
    We reset the guest's view of PMCR_EL0 unconditionally, based on
    the host's view of this register. It is however legal for an
    implementation not to provide any PMU, resulting in an UNDEF.
    
    The obvious fix is to skip the reset of this shadow register
    when no PMU is available, sidestepping the issue entirely.
    If no PMU is available, the guest is not able to request
    a virtual PMU anyway, so not doing nothing is the right thing
    to do!
    
    It is unlikely that this bug can hit any HW implementation
    though, as they all provide a PMU. It has been found using nested
    virt with the host KVM not implementing the PMU itself.

    bpftool: Fix compilation failure for net.o with older glibc
    
    commit 6f02b540d7597f357bc6ee711346761045d4e108 upstream.
    
    For older glibc ~2.17, #include'ing both linux/if.h and net/if.h
    fails due to complaints about redefinition of interface flags:
    
      CC       net.o
    In file included from net.c:13:0:
    /usr/include/linux/if.h:71:2: error: redeclaration of enumerator ‘IFF_UP’
      IFF_UP    = 1<<0,  /* sysfs */
      ^
    /usr/include/net/if.h:44:5: note: previous definition of ‘IFF_UP’ was here
         IFF_UP = 0x1,  /* Interface is up.  */
    
    The issue was fixed in kernel headers in [1], but since compilation
    of net.c picks up system headers the problem can recur.
    
    Dropping #include <linux/if.h> resolves the issue and it is
    not needed for compilation anyhow.

    cpufreq: powernow-k8: pass policy rather than use cpufreq_cpu_get()
    
    commit 943bdd0cecad06da8392a33093230e30e501eccc upstream.
    
    Currently there is an unlikely case where cpufreq_cpu_get() returns a
    NULL policy and this will cause a NULL pointer dereference later on.
    
    Fix this by passing the policy to transition_frequency_fidvid() from
    the caller and hence eliminating the need for the cpufreq_cpu_get()
    and cpufreq_cpu_put().
    
    Thanks to Viresh Kumar for suggesting the fix.

    commit 595a334148449bd1d27cf5d6fcb3b0d718cb1b9f upstream.
    
    If the dw_edma_alloc_burst() function fails then we free "chunk" but
    it's still on the "desc->chunk->list" list so it will lead to a use
    after free.  Also the "->chunks_alloc" count is incremented when it
    shouldn't be.
    
    In current kernels small allocations are guaranteed to succeed and
    dw_edma_alloc_burst() can't fail so this will not actually affect
    runtime.

    ARM: OMAP2+: omap_device: fix idling of devices during probe
    
    commit ec76c2eea903947202098090bbe07a739b5246e9 upstream.
    
    On the GTA04A5 od->_driver_status was not set to BUS_NOTIFY_BIND_DRIVER
    during probe of the second mmc used for wifi. Therefore
    omap_device_late_idle idled the device during probing causing oopses when
    accessing the registers.
    
    It was not set because od->_state was set to OMAP_DEVICE_STATE_IDLE
    in the notifier callback. Therefore set od->_driver_status also in that
    case.
    
    This came apparent after commit 21b2cec61c04 ("mmc: Set
    PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS for drivers that existed in v4.4") causing this
    oops:

    iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: fix edge-trigger interrupts
    
    commit 3f9bce7a22a3f8ac9d885c9d75bc45569f24ac8b upstream
    
    If we are using edge IRQs, new samples can arrive while processing
    current interrupt since there are no hw guarantees the irq line
    stays "low" long enough to properly detect the new interrupt.
    In this case the new sample will be missed.
    Polling FIFO status register in st_lsm6dsx_handler_thread routine
    allow us to read new samples even if the interrupt arrives while
    processing previous data and the timeslot where the line is "low"
    is too short to be properly detected.

    vmlinux.lds.h: Add PGO and AutoFDO input sections
    
    commit eff8728fe69880d3f7983bec3fb6cea4c306261f upstream.
    
    Basically, consider .text.{hot|unlikely|unknown}.* part of .text, too.
    
    When compiling with profiling information (collected via PGO
    instrumentations or AutoFDO sampling), Clang will separate code into
    .text.hot, .text.unlikely, or .text.unknown sections based on profiling
    information. After D79600 (clang-11), these sections will have a
    trailing `.` suffix, ie.  .text.hot., .text.unlikely., .text.unknown..
    
    When using -ffunction-sections together with profiling infomation,
    either explicitly (FGKASLR) or implicitly (LTO), code may be placed in
    sections following the convention:
    .text.hot.<foo>, .text.unlikely.<bar>, .text.unknown.<baz>
    where <foo>, <bar>, and <baz> are functions.  (This produces one section
    per function; we generally try to merge these all back via linker script
    so that we don't have 50k sections).
    
    For the above cases, we need to teach our linker scripts that such
    sections might exist and that we'd explicitly like them grouped
    together, otherwise we can wind up with code outside of the
    _stext/_etext boundaries that might not be mapped properly for some
    architectures, resulting in boot failures.
    
    If the linker script is not told about possible input sections, then
    where the section is placed as output is a heuristic-laiden mess that's
    non-portable between linkers (ie. BFD and LLD), and has resulted in many
    hard to debug bugs.  Kees Cook is working on cleaning this up by adding
    --orphan-handling=warn linker flag used in ARCH=powerpc to additional
    architectures. In the case of linker scripts, borrowing from the Zen of
    Python: explicit is better than implicit.
    
    Also, ld.bfd's internal linker script considers .text.hot AND
    .text.hot.* to be part of .text, as well as .text.unlikely and
    .text.unlikely.*. I didn't see support for .text.unknown.*, and didn't
    see Clang producing such code in our kernel builds, but I see code in
    LLVM that can produce such section names if profiling information is
    missing. That may point to a larger issue with generating or collecting
    profiles, but I would much rather be safe and explicit than have to
    debug yet another issue related to orphan section placement.

    exfat: Month timestamp metadata accidentally incremented
    
    The staging/exfat driver has departed, but a lot of distros are still tracking
    5.4-stable, so we should fix this.
    
    There was an 0/1 offset error in month handling for file metadata, causing
    the month to get incremented on each reference to the file.
    
    Thanks to Sebastian Gurtler for troubleshooting this, and Arpad Mueller
    for bringing it to my attention.

    x86/resctrl: Don't move a task to the same resource group
    
    commit a0195f314a25582b38993bf30db11c300f4f4611 upstream
    
    Shakeel Butt reported in [1] that a user can request a task to be moved
    to a resource group even if the task is already in the group. It just
    wastes time to do the move operation which could be costly to send IPI
    to a different CPU.
    
    Add a sanity check to ensure that the move operation only happens when
    the task is not already in the resource group.

    x86/resctrl: Use an IPI instead of task_work_add() to update PQR_ASSOC MSR
    
    commit ae28d1aae48a1258bd09a6f707ebb4231d79a761 upstream
    
    Currently, when moving a task to a resource group the PQR_ASSOC MSR is
    updated with the new closid and rmid in an added task callback. If the
    task is running, the work is run as soon as possible. If the task is not
    running, the work is executed later in the kernel exit path when the
    kernel returns to the task again.
    
    Updating the PQR_ASSOC MSR as soon as possible on the CPU a moved task
    is running is the right thing to do. Queueing work for a task that is
    not running is unnecessary (the PQR_ASSOC MSR is already updated when
    the task is scheduled in) and causing system resource waste with the way
    in which it is implemented: Work to update the PQR_ASSOC register is
    queued every time the user writes a task id to the "tasks" file, even if
    the task already belongs to the resource group.
    
    This could result in multiple pending work items associated with a
    single task even if they are all identical and even though only a single
    update with most recent values is needed. Specifically, even if a task
    is moved between different resource groups while it is sleeping then it
    is only the last move that is relevant but yet a work item is queued
    during each move.
    
    This unnecessary queueing of work items could result in significant
    system resource waste, especially on tasks sleeping for a long time.
    For example, as demonstrated by Shakeel Butt in [1] writing the same
    task id to the "tasks" file can quickly consume significant memory. The
    same problem (wasted system resources) occurs when moving a task between
    different resource groups.
    
    As pointed out by Valentin Schneider in [2] there is an additional issue
    with the way in which the queueing of work is done in that the task_struct
    update is currently done after the work is queued, resulting in a race with
    the register update possibly done before the data needed by the update is
    available.
    
    To solve these issues, update the PQR_ASSOC MSR in a synchronous way
    right after the new closid and rmid are ready during the task movement,
    only if the task is running. If a moved task is not running nothing
    is done since the PQR_ASSOC MSR will be updated next time the task is
    scheduled. This is the same way used to update the register when tasks
    are moved as part of resource group removal.

    net: ip: always refragment ip defragmented packets
    
    [ Upstream commit bb4cc1a18856a73f0ff5137df0c2a31f4c50f6cf ]
    
    Conntrack reassembly records the largest fragment size seen in IPCB.
    However, when this gets forwarded/transmitted, fragmentation will only
    be forced if one of the fragmented packets had the DF bit set.
    
    In that case, a flag in IPCB will force fragmentation even if the
    MTU is large enough.
    
    This should work fine, but this breaks with ip tunnels.
    Consider client that sends a UDP datagram of size X to another host.
    
    The client fragments the datagram, so two packets, of size y and z, are
    sent. DF bit is not set on any of these packets.
    
    Middlebox netfilter reassembles those packets back to single size-X
    packet, before routing decision.
    
    packet-size-vs-mtu checks in ip_forward are irrelevant, because DF bit
    isn't set.  At output time, ip refragmentation is skipped as well
    because x is still smaller than the mtu of the output device.
    
    If ttransmit device is an ip tunnel, the packet size increases to
    x+overhead.
    
    Also, tunnel might be configured to force DF bit on outer header.
    
    In this case, packet will be dropped (exceeds MTU) and an ICMP error is
    generated back to sender.
    
    But sender already respects the announced MTU, all the packets that
    it sent did fit the announced mtu.
    
    Force refragmentation as per original sizes unconditionally so ip tunnel
    will encapsulate the fragments instead.
    
    The only other solution I see is to place ip refragmentation in
    the ip_tunnel code to handle this case.

    net: fix pmtu check in nopmtudisc mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 50c661670f6a3908c273503dfa206dfc7aa54c07 ]
    
    For some reason ip_tunnel insist on setting the DF bit anyway when the
    inner header has the DF bit set, EVEN if the tunnel was configured with
    'nopmtudisc'.
    
    This means that the script added in the previous commit
    cannot be made to work by adding the 'nopmtudisc' flag to the
    ip tunnel configuration. Doing so breaks connectivity even for the
    without-conntrack/netfilter scenario.
    
    When nopmtudisc is set, the tunnel will skip the mtu check, so no
    icmp error is sent to client. Then, because inner header has DF set,
    the outer header gets added with DF bit set as well.
    
    IP stack then sends an error to itself because the packet exceeds
    the device MTU.

    [ Upstream commit 5316a7c0130acf09bfc8bb0092407006010fcccc ]
    
    Adds new 2 new tests to the PTMU script: pmtu_ipv4/6_route_change.
    
    These tests explicitly test for a recently discovered problem in the
    IPv6 routing framework where PMTU exceptions were not properly released
    when replacing a route via "ip route change ...".
    
    After creating PMTU exceptions, the route from the device A to R1 will be
    replaced with a new route, then device A will be deleted. If the PMTU
    exceptions were properly cleaned up by the kernel, this device deletion
    will succeed. Otherwise, the unregistration of the device will stall, and
    messages such as the following will be logged in dmesg:

    net: ipv6: fib: flush exceptions when purging route
    
    [ Upstream commit d8f5c29653c3f6995e8979be5623d263e92f6b86 ]
    
    Route removal is handled by two code paths. The main removal path is via
    fib6_del_route() which will handle purging any PMTU exceptions from the
    cache, removing all per-cpu copies of the DST entry used by the route, and
    releasing the fib6_info struct.
    
    The second removal location is during fib6_add_rt2node() during a route
    replacement operation. This path also calls fib6_purge_rt() to handle
    cleaning up the per-cpu copies of the DST entries and releasing the
    fib6_info associated with the older route, but it does not flush any PMTU
    exceptions that the older route had. Since the older route is removed from
    the tree during the replacement, we lose any way of accessing it again.
    
    As these lingering DSTs and the fib6_info struct are holding references to
    the underlying netdevice struct as well, unregistering that device from the
    kernel can never complete.

    net: cdc_ncm: correct overhead in delayed_ndp_size
    
    [ Upstream commit 7a68d725e4ea384977445e0bcaed3d7de83ab5b3 ]
    
    Aligning to tx_ndp_modulus is not sufficient because the next align
    call can be cdc_ncm_align_tail, which can add up to ctx->tx_modulus +
    ctx->tx_remainder - 1 bytes. This used to lead to occasional crashes
    on a Huawei 909s-120 LTE module as follows:
    
    - the condition marked /* if there is a remaining skb [...] */ is true
      so the swaps happen
    - skb_out is set from ctx->tx_curr_skb
    - skb_out->len is exactly 0x3f52
    - ctx->tx_curr_size is 0x4000 and delayed_ndp_size is 0xac
      (note that the sum of skb_out->len and delayed_ndp_size is 0x3ffe)
    - the for loop over n is executed once
    - the cdc_ncm_align_tail call marked /* align beginning of next frame */
      increases skb_out->len to 0x3f56 (the sum is now 0x4002)
    - the condition marked /* check if we had enough room left [...] */ is
      false so we break out of the loop
    - the condition marked /* If requested, put NDP at end of frame. */ is
      true so the NDP is written into skb_out
    - now skb_out->len is 0x4002, so padding_count is minus two interpreted
      as an unsigned number, which is used as the length argument to memset,
      leading to a crash with various symptoms but usually including
    
    > Call Trace:
    >  <IRQ>
    >  cdc_ncm_fill_tx_frame+0x83a/0x970 [cdc_ncm]
    >  cdc_mbim_tx_fixup+0x1d9/0x240 [cdc_mbim]
    >  usbnet_start_xmit+0x5d/0x720 [usbnet]
    
    The cdc_ncm_align_tail call first aligns on a ctx->tx_modulus
    boundary (adding at most ctx->tx_modulus-1 bytes), then adds
    ctx->tx_remainder bytes. Alternatively, the next alignment call can
    occur in cdc_ncm_ndp16 or cdc_ncm_ndp32, in which case at most
    ctx->tx_ndp_modulus-1 bytes are added.
    
    A similar problem has occurred before, and the code is nontrivial to
    reason about, so add a guard before the crashing call. By that time it
    is too late to prevent any memory corruption (we'll have written past
    the end of the buffer already) but we can at least try to get a warning
    written into an on-disk log by avoiding the hard crash caused by padding
    past the buffer with a huge number of zeros.
