    staging: greybus: fix stack size warning with UBSAN
    
    commit 144779edf598e0896302c35a0926ef0b68f17c4b upstream.
    
    clang warns about excessive stack usage in this driver when
    UBSAN is enabled:
    
    drivers/staging/greybus/audio_topology.c:977:12: error: stack frame size of 1836 bytes in function 'gbaudio_tplg_create_widget' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=]
    
    Rework this code to no longer use compound literals for
    initializing the structure in each case, but instead keep
    the common bits in a preallocated constant array and copy
    them as needed.

    drm/i915: Avoid bitwise vs logical OR warning in snb_wm_latency_quirk()
    
    commit 2e70570656adfe1c5d9a29940faa348d5f132199 upstream.
    
    A new warning in clang points out a place in this file where a bitwise
    OR is being used with boolean types:
    
    drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_pm.c:3066:12: warning: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
            changed = ilk_increase_wm_latency(dev_priv, dev_priv->wm.pri_latency, 12) |
                      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    This construct is intentional, as it allows every one of the calls to
    ilk_increase_wm_latency() to occur (instead of short circuiting with
    logical OR) while still caring about the result of each call.
    
    To make this clearer to the compiler, use the '|=' operator to assign
    the result of each ilk_increase_wm_latency() call to changed, which
    keeps the meaning of the code the same but makes it obvious that every
    one of these calls is expected to happen.

    staging: wlan-ng: Avoid bitwise vs logical OR warning in hfa384x_usb_throttlefn()
    
    commit 502408a61f4b7eb4713f44bd77f4a48e6cb1b59a upstream.
    
    A new warning in clang points out a place in this file where a bitwise
    OR is being used with boolean expressions:
    
    In file included from drivers/staging/wlan-ng/prism2usb.c:2:
    drivers/staging/wlan-ng/hfa384x_usb.c:3787:7: warning: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
                ((test_and_clear_bit(THROTTLE_RX, &hw->usb_flags) &&

    drivers/staging/wlan-ng/hfa384x_usb.c:3787:7: note: cast one or both operands to int to silence this warning
    1 warning generated.
    
    The comment explains that short circuiting here is undesirable, as the
    calls to test_and_{clear,set}_bit() need to happen for both sides of the
    expression.
    
    Clang's suggestion would work to silence the warning but the readability
    of the expression would suffer even more. To clean up the warning and
    make the block more readable, use a variable for each side of the
    bitwise expression.

    random: fix crash on multiple early calls to add_bootloader_randomness()
    
    commit f7e67b8e803185d0aabe7f29d25a35c8be724a78 upstream.
    
    Currently, if CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER is enabled, multiple calls
    to add_bootloader_randomness() are broken and can cause a NULL pointer
    dereference, as noted by Ivan T. Ivanov. This is not only a hypothetical
    problem, as qemu on arm64 may provide bootloader entropy via EFI and via
    devicetree.
    
    On the first call to add_hwgenerator_randomness(), crng_fast_load() is
    executed, and if the seed is long enough, crng_init will be set to 1.
    On subsequent calls to add_bootloader_randomness() and then to
    add_hwgenerator_randomness(), crng_fast_load() will be skipped. Instead,
    wait_event_interruptible() and then credit_entropy_bits() will be called.
    If the entropy count for that second seed is large enough, that proceeds
    to crng_reseed().
    
    However, both wait_event_interruptible() and crng_reseed() depends
    (at least in numa_crng_init()) on workqueues. Therefore, test whether
    system_wq is already initialized, which is a sufficient indicator that
    workqueue_init_early() has progressed far enough.
    
    If we wind up hitting the !system_wq case, we later want to do what
    would have been done there when wqs are up, so set a flag, and do that
    work later from the rand_initialize() call.

    random: fix data race on crng init time
    
    commit 009ba8568be497c640cab7571f7bfd18345d7b24 upstream.
    
    _extract_crng() does plain loads of crng->init_time and
    crng_global_init_time, which causes undefined behavior if
    crng_reseed() and RNDRESEEDCRNG modify these corrently.
    
    Use READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() to make the behavior defined.
    
    Don't fix the race on crng->init_time by protecting it with crng->lock,
    since it's not a problem for duplicate reseedings to occur.  I.e., the
    lockless access with READ_ONCE() is fine.

    random: fix data race on crng_node_pool
    
    commit 5d73d1e320c3fd94ea15ba5f79301da9a8bcc7de upstream.
    
    extract_crng() and crng_backtrack_protect() load crng_node_pool with a
    plain load, which causes undefined behavior if do_numa_crng_init()
    modifies it concurrently.
    
    Fix this by using READ_ONCE().  Note: as per the previous discussion
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20211219025139.31085-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/T/#u,
    READ_ONCE() is believed to be sufficient here, and it was requested that
    it be used here instead of smp_load_acquire().
    
    Also change do_numa_crng_init() to set crng_node_pool using
    cmpxchg_release() instead of mb() + cmpxchg(), as the former is
    sufficient here but is more lightweight.

    No information is deliberately sent in hf->flags in host -> device

    dereference:

    veth: Do not record rx queue hint in veth_xmit
    
    commit 710ad98c363a66a0cd8526465426c5c5f8377ee0 upstream.
    
    Laurent reported that they have seen a significant amount of TCP retransmissions
    at high throughput from applications residing in network namespaces talking to
    the outside world via veths. The drops were seen on the qdisc layer (fq_codel,
    as per systemd default) of the phys device such as ena or virtio_net due to all
    traffic hitting a _single_ TX queue _despite_ multi-queue device. (Note that the
    setup was _not_ using XDP on veths as the issue is generic.)
    
    More specifically, after edbea9220251 ("veth: Store queue_mapping independently
    of XDP prog presence") which made it all the way back to v4.19.184+,
    skb_record_rx_queue() would set skb->queue_mapping to 1 (given 1 RX and 1 TX
    queue by default for veths) instead of leaving at 0.
    
    This is eventually retained and callbacks like ena_select_queue() will also pick
    single queue via netdev_core_pick_tx()'s ndo_select_queue() once all the traffic
    is forwarded to that device via upper stack or other means. Similarly, for others
    not implementing ndo_select_queue() if XPS is disabled, netdev_pick_tx() might
    call into the skb_tx_hash() and check for prior skb_rx_queue_recorded() as well.
    
    In general, it is a _bad_ idea for virtual devices like veth to mess around with
    queue selection [by default]. Given dev->real_num_tx_queues is by default 1,
    the skb->queue_mapping was left untouched, and so prior to edbea9220251 the
    netdev_core_pick_tx() could do its job upon __dev_queue_xmit() on the phys device.
    
    Unbreak this and restore prior behavior by removing the skb_record_rx_queue()
    from veth_xmit() altogether.
    
    If the veth peer has an XDP program attached, then it would return the first RX
    queue index in xdp_md->rx_queue_index (unless configured in non-default manner).
    However, this is still better than breaking the generic case.

    USB: Fix "slab-out-of-bounds Write" bug in usb_hcd_poll_rh_status
    
    commit 1d7d4c07932e04355d6e6528d44a2f2c9e354346 upstream.
    
    When the USB core code for getting root-hub status reports was
    originally written, it was assumed that the hub driver would be its
    only caller.  But this isn't true now; user programs can use usbfs to
    communicate with root hubs and get status reports.  When they do this,
    they may use a transfer_buffer that is smaller than the data returned
    by the HCD, which will lead to a buffer overflow error when
    usb_hcd_poll_rh_status() tries to store the status data.  This was
    discovered by syzbot:
    
    BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in memcpy include/linux/fortify-string.h:225 [inline]
    BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in usb_hcd_poll_rh_status+0x5f4/0x780 drivers/usb/core/hcd.c:776
    Write of size 2 at addr ffff88801da403c0 by task syz-executor133/4062
    
    This patch fixes the bug by reducing the amount of status data if it
    won't fit in the transfer_buffer.  If some data gets discarded then
    the URB's completion status is set to -EOVERFLOW rather than 0, to let
    the user know what happened.

    USB: core: Fix bug in resuming hub's handling of wakeup requests
    
    commit 0f663729bb4afc92a9986b66131ebd5b8a9254d1 upstream.
    
    Bugzilla #213839 reports a 7-port hub that doesn't work properly when
    devices are plugged into some of the ports; the kernel goes into an
    unending disconnect/reinitialize loop as shown in the bug report.
    
    This "7-port hub" comprises two four-port hubs with one plugged into
    the other; the failures occur when a device is plugged into one of the
    downstream hub's ports.  (These hubs have other problems too.  For
    example, they bill themselves as USB-2.0 compliant but they only run
    at full speed.)
    
    It turns out that the failures are caused by bugs in both the kernel
    and the hub.  The hub's bug is that it reports a different
    bmAttributes value in its configuration descriptor following a remote
    wakeup (0xe0 before, 0xc0 after -- the wakeup-support bit has
    changed).
    
    The kernel's bug is inside the hub driver's resume handler.  When
    hub_activate() sees that one of the hub's downstream ports got a
    wakeup request from a child device, it notes this fact by setting the
    corresponding bit in the hub->change_bits variable.  But this variable
    is meant for connection changes, not wakeup events; setting it causes
    the driver to believe the downstream port has been disconnected and
    then connected again (in addition to having received a wakeup
    request).
    
    Because of this, the hub driver then tries to check whether the device
    currently plugged into the downstream port is the same as the device
    that had been attached there before.  Normally this check succeeds and
    wakeup handling continues with no harm done (which is why the bug
    remained undetected until now).  But with these dodgy hubs, the check
    fails because the config descriptor has changed.  This causes the hub
    driver to reinitialize the child device, leading to the
    disconnect/reinitialize loop described in the bug report.
    
    The proper way to note reception of a downstream wakeup request is
    to set a bit in the hub->event_bits variable instead of
    hub->change_bits.  That way the hub driver will realize that something
    has happened to the port but will not think the port and child device
    have been disconnected.  This patch makes that change.

    Bluetooth: bfusb: fix division by zero in send path
    
    commit b5e6fa7a12572c82f1e7f2f51fbb02a322291291 upstream.
    
    Add the missing bulk-out endpoint sanity check to probe() to avoid

    broken descriptors (or when doing descriptor fuzz testing).
    
    Note that USB core will reject URBs submitted for endpoints with zero
    wMaxPacketSize but that drivers doing packet-size calculations still
    need to handle this (cf. commit 2548288b4fb0 ("USB: Fix: Don't skip

    workqueue: Fix unbind_workers() VS wq_worker_running() race
    
    commit 07edfece8bcb0580a1828d939e6f8d91a8603eb2 upstream.
    
    At CPU-hotplug time, unbind_worker() may preempt a worker while it is
    waking up. In that case the following scenario can happen:
    
            unbind_workers()                     wq_worker_running()
            --------------                      -------------------
                                          if (!(worker->flags & WORKER_NOT_RUNNING))
                                              //PREEMPTED by unbind_workers
            worker->flags |= WORKER_UNBOUND;
            [...]
            atomic_set(&pool->nr_running, 0);
            //resume to worker
                                                  atomic_inc(&worker->pool->nr_running);
    
    After unbind_worker() resets pool->nr_running, the value is expected to
    remain 0 until the pool ever gets rebound in case cpu_up() is called on
    the target CPU in the future. But here the race leaves pool->nr_running
    with a value of 1, triggering the following warning when the worker goes
    idle:

    Also due to this incorrect "nr_running == 1", further queued work may
    end up not being served, because no worker is awaken at work insert time.
    This raises rcutorture writer stalls for example.
    
    Fix this with disabling preemption in the right place in
    wq_worker_running().
    
    It's worth noting that if the worker migrates and runs concurrently with
    unbind_workers(), it is guaranteed to see the WORKER_UNBOUND flag update
    due to set_cpus_allowed_ptr() acquiring/releasing rq->lock.
