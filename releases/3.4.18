    Revert: ARM: SAMSUNG: Add naming of s3c64xx-spi devices
    
    This reverts commit baa526f45d3f096a1cd9f14b668203a03bbab6f9, which is
    commit 308b3afb97dc342e9c4f958d8b4c459ae0e22bd7 upstream.
    
    To quote Colin Cross:
            This patch breaks Exynos5 spi on 3.4.17.  The patch with the bug
            that this patch was supposed to address went in to 3.6 and not
            3.4, so this patch causes a driver name mismatch when applied to
            3.4.

    HID: microsoft: fix invalid rdesc for 3k kbd
    
    commit 3ccc60f9d8c39180c205dba1a020735bda1b2491 upstream.
    
    Microsoft Digital Media Keyboard 3000 has two interfaces, and the
    second one has a report descriptor with a bug. The second collection
    says:
    05 01 -- global; usage page -- 01 -- Generic Desktop Controls
    09 80 -- local; usage -- 80 -- System Control
    a1 01 -- main; collection -- 01 -- application
    
    85 03 -- global; report ID -- 03
    19 00 -- local; Usage Minimum -- 00
    29 ff -- local; Usage Maximum -- ff
    15 00 -- global; Logical Minimum -- 0
    26 ff 00 -- global; Logical Maximum -- ff
    81 00 -- main; input
    
    c0 -- main; End Collection
    
    I.e. it makes us think that there are all kinds of usages of system
    control. That the keyboard is a not only a keyboard, but also a
    joystick, mouse, gamepad, keypad, etc. The same as for the Wireless
    Desktop Receiver, this should be Physical Min/Max. So fix that
    appropriately.

    target: Fix double-free of se_cmd in target_complete_tmr_failure
    
    commit e13d5fef88c40b87c8430f8274c3a9ca32ef90bc upstream.
    
    Fabric drivers currently expect to internally release se_cmd in the event
    of a TMR failure during target_submit_tmr(), which means the immediate call
    to transport_generic_free_cmd() after TFO->queue_tm_rsp() from within
    target_complete_tmr_failure() workqueue context is wrong.
    
    This is done as some fabrics expect TMR operations to be acknowledged
    before releasing the descriptor, so the assumption that core is releasing
    se_cmd associated TMR memory is incorrect.  This fixes a OOPs where
    transport_generic_free_cmd() was being called more than once.
    
    This bug was originally observed with tcm_qla2xxx fabric ports.

    b43: Fix oops on unload when firmware not found
    
    commit f89ff6441df06abc2d95f3ef67525923032d6283 upstream.
    
    When b43 fails to find firmware when loaded, a subsequent unload will
    oops due to calling ieee80211_unregister_hw() when the corresponding
    register call was never made.
    
    Commit 2d838bb608e2d1f6cb4280e76748cb812dc822e7 fixed the same problem

    md/raid1: Fix assembling of arrays containing Replacements.
    
    commit 02b898f2f04e418094f0093a3ad0b415bcdbe8eb upstream.
    
    setup_conf in raid1.c uses conf->raid_disks before assigning
    a value.  It is used when including 'Replacement' devices.
    
    The consequence is that assembling an array which contains a
    replacement will misbehave and either not include the replacement, or
    not include the device being replaced.
    
    Though this doesn't lead directly to data corruption, it could lead to
    reduced data safety.
    
    So use mddev->raid_disks, which is initialised, instead.
    
    Bug was introduced by commit c19d57980b38a5bb613a898937a1cf85f422fb9b
          md/raid1: recognise replacements when assembling arrays.
    
    in 3.3, so fix is suitable for 3.3.y thru 3.6.y.

    ext4: fix unjournaled inode bitmap modification
    
    commit ffb5387e85d528fb6d0d924abfa3fbf0fc484071 upstream.
    
    commit 119c0d4460b001e44b41dcf73dc6ee794b98bd31 changed
    ext4_new_inode() such that the inode bitmap was being modified
    outside a transaction, which could lead to corruption, and was
    discovered when journal_checksum found a bad checksum in the
    journal during log replay.
    
    Nix ran into this when using the journal_async_commit mount
    option, which enables journal checksumming.  The ensuing
    journal replay failures due to the bad checksums led to
    filesystem corruption reported as the now infamous
    "Apparent serious progressive ext4 data corruption bug"
    
    [ Changed by tytso to only call ext4_journal_get_write_access() only
      when we're fairly certain that we're going to allocate the inode. ]
    
    I've tested this by mounting with journal_checksum and
    running fsstress then dropping power; I've also tested by
    hacking DM to create snapshots w/o first quiescing, which
    allows me to test journal replay repeatedly w/o actually
    power-cycling the box.  Without the patch I hit a journal
    checksum error every time.  With this fix it survives
    many iterations.
