    x86/defconfig: Enable CONFIG_USB_XHCI_HCD=y
    
    commit 72a9c673636b779e370983fea08e40f97039b981 upstream.
    
    A spanking new machine I just got has all but one USB ports wired as 3.0.
    Booting defconfig resulted in no keyboard or mouse, which was pretty
    uncool.  Let's enable that -- USB3 is ubiquitous rather than an oddity.
    As 'y' not 'm' -- recovering from initrd problems needs a keyboard.
    
    Also add it to the 32-bit defconfig.

    powerpc/dma: Fix dma_map_ops::get_required_mask
    
    commit 437ef802e0adc9f162a95213a3488e8646e5fc03 upstream.
    
    There are 2 problems with it:
      1. "<" vs expected "<<"
      2. the shift number is an IOMMU page number mask, not an address
      mask as the IOMMU page shift is missing.
    
    This did not hit us before f1565c24b596 ("powerpc: use the generic
    dma_ops_bypass mode") because we had additional code to handle bypass
    mask so this chunk (almost?) never executed.However there were
    reports that aacraid does not work with "iommu=nobypass".
    
    After f1565c24b596, aacraid (and probably others which call
    dma_get_required_mask() before setting the mask) was unable to enable
    64bit DMA and fall back to using IOMMU which was known not to work,
    one of the problems is double free of an IOMMU page.
    
    This fixes DMA for aacraid, both with and without "iommu=nobypass" in
    the kernel command line. Verified with "stress-ng -d 4".
    
    Fixes: 6a5c7be5e484 ("powerpc: Override dma_get_required_mask by platform hook and ops")

    ehci-hcd: Move include to keep CRC stable
    
    commit 29231826f3bd65500118c473fccf31c0cf14dbc0 upstream.
    
    The CRC calculation done by genksyms is triggered when the parser hits
    EXPORT_SYMBOL*() macros. At this point, genksyms recursively expands the
    types of the function parameters, and uses that as the input for the CRC
    calculation. In the case of forward-declared structs, the type expands
    to 'UNKNOWN'. Following this, it appears that the result of the
    expansion of each type is cached somewhere, and seems to be re-used
    when/if the same type is seen again for another exported symbol in the
    same C file.
    
    Unfortunately, this can cause CRC 'stability' issues when a struct
    definition becomes visible in the middle of a C file. For example, let's
    assume code with the following pattern:
    
        struct foo;
    
        int bar(struct foo *arg)
        {
            /* Do work ... */
        }
        EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(bar);
    
        /* This contains struct foo's definition */
        #include "foo.h"
    
        int baz(struct foo *arg)
        {
            /* Do more work ... */
        }
        EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(baz);
    
    Here, baz's CRC will be computed using the expansion of struct foo that
    was cached after bar's CRC calculation ('UNKOWN' here). But if
    EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(bar) is removed from the file (because of e.g. symbol
    trimming using CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS), struct foo will be expanded
    late, during baz's CRC calculation, which now has visibility over the
    full struct definition, hence resulting in a different CRC for baz.
    
    The proper fix for this certainly is in genksyms, but that will take me
    some time to get right. In the meantime, we have seen one occurrence of
    this in the ehci-hcd code which hits this problem because of the way it
    includes C files halfway through the code together with an unlucky mix
    of symbol trimming.
    
    In order to workaround this, move the include done in ehci-hub.c early
    in ehci-hcd.c, hence making sure the struct definitions are visible to
    the entire file. This improves CRC stability of the ehci-hcd exports
    even when symbol trimming is enabled.

    serial: 8250_pci: Add Realtek 816a and 816b
    
    commit 3c5a87be170aba8ac40982182f812dcff6ed1ad1 upstream.
    
    These serial ports are exposed by the OOB-management-engine on
    RealManage-enabled network cards (e.g. AMD DASH enabled systems using
    Realtek cards).
    
    Because these have 3 BARs, they fail the "num_iomem <= 1" check in
    serial_pci_guess_board.
    
    I've manually checked the two IOMEM regions and BAR 2 doesn't seem to
    respond to reads, but BAR 4 seems to be an MMIO version of the IO ports
    (untested).
    
    With this change, the ports are detected:
    0000:02:00.1: ttyS0 at I/O 0x2200 (irq = 82, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A
    0000:02:00.2: ttyS1 at I/O 0x2100 (irq = 55, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A

    The SCSI layer can go into an ugly loop if you ignore that a device is
    gone. You need to report an error in the command rather than in the
    return value of the queue method.
    
    We need to specifically check for ENODEV. The issue goes back to the
    introduction of the driver.

    On A20R machines the interrupt pending bits in cause register need to be

    find the interrupt cause and after interrupt service. In

    function to do after service update got lost, which caused spurious

    fbcon: Fix user font detection test at fbcon_resize().
    
    [ Upstream commit ec0972adecb391a8d8650832263a4790f3bfb4df ]
    
    syzbot is reporting OOB read at fbcon_resize() [1], for
    commit 39b3cffb8cf31117 ("fbcon: prevent user font height or width change
     from causing potential out-of-bounds access") is by error using
    registered_fb[con2fb_map[vc->vc_num]]->fbcon_par->p->userfont (which was
    set to non-zero) instead of fb_display[vc->vc_num].userfont (which remains
    zero for that display).
    
    We could remove tricky userfont flag [2], for we can determine it by
    comparing address of the font data and addresses of built-in font data.
    But since that commit is failing to fix the original OOB read [3], this
    patch keeps the change minimal in case we decide to revert altogether.

    i2c: algo: pca: Reapply i2c bus settings after reset
    
    [ Upstream commit 0a355aeb24081e4538d4d424cd189f16c0bbd983 ]
    
    If something goes wrong (such as the SCL being stuck low) then we need
    to reset the PCA chip. The issue with this is that on reset we lose all
    config settings and the chip ends up in a disabled state which results
    in a lock up/high CPU usage. We need to re-apply any configuration that
    had previously been set and re-enable the chip.

    scsi: lpfc: Fix FLOGI/PLOGI receive race condition in pt2pt discovery
    
    [ Upstream commit 7b08e89f98cee9907895fabb64cf437bc505ce9a ]
    
    The driver is unable to successfully login with remote device. During pt2pt
    login, the driver completes its FLOGI request with the remote device having
    WWN precedence.  The remote device issues its own (delayed) FLOGI after
    accepting the driver's and, upon transmitting the FLOGI, immediately
    recognizes it has already processed the driver's FLOGI thus it transitions
    to sending a PLOGI before waiting for an ACC to its FLOGI.
    
    In the driver, the FLOGI is received and an ACC sent, followed by the PLOGI
    being received and an ACC sent. The issue is that the PLOGI reception
    occurs before the response from the adapter from the FLOGI ACC is
    received. Processing of the PLOGI sets state flags to perform the REG_RPI
    mailbox command and proceed with the rest of discovery on the port. The
    same completion routine used by both FLOGI and PLOGI is generic in
    nature. One of the things it does is clear flags, and those flags happen to
    drive the rest of discovery.  So what happened was the PLOGI processing set
    the flags, the FLOGI ACC completion cleared them, thus when the PLOGI ACC
    completes it doesn't see the flags and stops.
    
    Fix by modifying the generic completion routine to not clear the rest of
    discovery flag (NLP_ACC_REGLOGIN) unless the completion is also associated
    with performing a mailbox command as part of its handling.  For things such
    as FLOGI ACC, there isn't a subsequent action to perform with the adapter,
    thus there is no mailbox cmd ptr. PLOGI ACC though will perform REG_RPI
    upon completion, thus there is a mailbox cmd ptr.

    A client should be able to handle getting an ERR_DELAY error

    Using gcov to collect coverage data for kernels compiled with GCC 10.1
    causes random malfunctions and kernel crashes.  This is the result of a
    changed GCOV_COUNTERS value in GCC 10.1 that causes a mismatch between
    the layout of the gcov_info structure created by GCC profiling code and
    the related structure used by the kernel.
    
    Fix this by updating the in-kernel GCOV_COUNTERS value.  Also re-enable
    config GCOV_KERNEL for use with GCC 10.

    usb: Fix out of sync data toggle if a configured device is reconfigured
    
    commit cfd54fa83a5068b61b7eb28d3c117d8354c74c7a upstream.
    
    Userspace drivers that use a SetConfiguration() request to "lightweight"
    reset an already configured usb device might cause data toggles to get out
    of sync between the device and host, and the device becomes unusable.
    
    The xHCI host requires endpoints to be dropped and added back to reset the
    toggle. If USB core notices the new configuration is the same as the
    current active configuration it will avoid these extra steps by calling
    usb_reset_configuration() instead of usb_set_configuration().
    
    A SetConfiguration() request will reset the device side data toggles.
    Make sure usb_reset_configuration() function also drops and adds back the
    endpoints to ensure data toggles are in sync.
    
    To avoid code duplication split the current usb_disable_device() function
    and reuse the endpoint specific part.

    USB: serial: option: add support for SIM7070/SIM7080/SIM7090 modules
    
    commit 1ac698790819b83f39fd7ea4f6cdabee9bdd7b38 upstream.
    
    These modules have 2 different USB layouts:
    
    The default layout with PID 0x9205 (AT+CUSBSELNV=1) exposes 4 TTYs and
    an ECM interface:

     * ttyUSB1: GNSS data.
     * ttyUSB2: AT-capable port (control).
     * ttyUSB3: AT-capable port (data).
    
    In the secondary layout with PID=0x9206 (AT+CUSBSELNV=86) the module
    exposes 6 TTY ports:

    commit 973c096f6a85e5b5f2a295126ba6928d9a6afd45 upstream.
    
    Yunhai Zhang recently fixed a VGA software scrollback bug in commit
    ebfdfeeae8c0 ("vgacon: Fix for missing check in scrollback handling"),
    but that then made people look more closely at some of this code, and
    there were more problems on the vgacon side, but also the fbcon software
    scrollback.
    
    We don't really have anybody who maintains this code - probably because
    nobody actually _uses_ it any more.  Sure, people still use both VGA and
    the framebuffer consoles, but they are no longer the main user
    interfaces to the kernel, and haven't been for decades, so these kinds
    of extra features end up bitrotting and not really being used.
    
    So rather than try to maintain a likely unused set of code, I'll just
    aggressively remove it, and see if anybody even notices.  Maybe there
    are people who haven't jumped on the whole GUI badnwagon yet, and think
    it's just a fad.  And maybe those people use the scrollback code.
    
    If that turns out to be the case, we can resurrect this again, once
    we've found the sucker^Wmaintainer for it who actually uses it.

    fbcon: remove soft scrollback code
    
    commit 50145474f6ef4a9c19205b173da6264a644c7489 upstream.
    
    This (and the VGA soft scrollback) turns out to have various nasty small
    special cases that nobody really is willing to fight.  The soft
    scrollback code was really useful a few decades ago when you typically
    used the console interactively as the main way to interact with the
    machine, but that just isn't the case any more.
    
    So it's not worth dragging along.

    rbd: require global CAP_SYS_ADMIN for mapping and unmapping
    
    commit f44d04e696feaf13d192d942c4f14ad2e117065a upstream.
    
    It turns out that currently we rely only on sysfs attribute
    permissions:
    
      $ ll /sys/bus/rbd/{add*,remove*}
      --w------- 1 root root 4096 Sep  3 20:37 /sys/bus/rbd/add
      --w------- 1 root root 4096 Sep  3 20:37 /sys/bus/rbd/add_single_major
      --w------- 1 root root 4096 Sep  3 20:37 /sys/bus/rbd/remove
      --w------- 1 root root 4096 Sep  3 20:38 /sys/bus/rbd/remove_single_major
    
    This means that images can be mapped and unmapped (i.e. block devices
    can be created and deleted) by a UID 0 process even after it drops all
    privileges or by any process with CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE in its user namespace
    as long as UID 0 is mapped into that user namespace.
    
    Be consistent with other virtual block devices (loop, nbd, dm, md, etc)
    and require CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the initial user namespace for mapping and
    unmapping, and also for dumping the configuration string and refreshing
    the image header.

    scsi: target: iscsi: Fix hang in iscsit_access_np() when getting tpg->np_login_sem
    
    commit ed43ffea78dcc97db3f561da834f1a49c8961e33 upstream.
    
    The iSCSI target login thread might get stuck with the following stack:
    
    cat /proc/`pidof iscsi_np`/stack
    [<0>] down_interruptible+0x42/0x50
    [<0>] iscsit_access_np+0xe3/0x167
    [<0>] iscsi_target_locate_portal+0x695/0x8ac
    [<0>] __iscsi_target_login_thread+0x855/0xb82
    [<0>] iscsi_target_login_thread+0x2f/0x5a
    [<0>] kthread+0xfa/0x130
    [<0>] ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30
    
    This can be reproduced via the following steps:
    
    1. Initiator A tries to log in to iqn1-tpg1 on port 3260. After finishing
       PDU exchange in the login thread and before the negotiation is finished
       the the network link goes down. At this point A has not finished login
       and tpg->np_login_sem is held.
    
    2. Initiator B tries to log in to iqn2-tpg1 on port 3260. After finishing
       PDU exchange in the login thread the target expects to process remaining
       login PDUs in workqueue context.
    
    3. Initiator A' tries to log in to iqn1-tpg1 on port 3260 from a new
       socket. A' will wait for tpg->np_login_sem with np->np_login_timer
       loaded to wait for at most 15 seconds. The lock is held by A so A'
       eventually times out.
    
    4. Before A' got timeout initiator B gets negotiation failed and calls
       iscsi_target_login_drop()->iscsi_target_login_sess_out().  The
       np->np_login_timer is canceled and initiator A' will hang forever.
       Because A' is now in the login thread, no new login requests can be
       serviced.
    
    Fix this by moving iscsi_stop_login_thread_timer() out of
    iscsi_target_login_sess_out(). Also remove iscsi_np parameter from
    iscsi_target_login_sess_out().

    btrfs: fix wrong address when faulting in pages in the search ioctl
    
    commit 1c78544eaa4660096aeb6a57ec82b42cdb3bfe5a upstream.
    
    When faulting in the pages for the user supplied buffer for the search
    ioctl, we are passing only the base address of the buffer to the function
    fault_in_pages_writeable(). This means that after the first iteration of
    the while loop that searches for leaves, when we have a non-zero offset,
    stored in 'sk_offset', we try to fault in a wrong page range.
    
    So fix this by adding the offset in 'sk_offset' to the base address of the
    user supplied buffer when calling fault_in_pages_writeable().
    
    Several users have reported that the applications compsize and bees have
    started to operate incorrectly since commit a48b73eca4ceb9 ("btrfs: fix
    potential deadlock in the search ioctl") was added to stable trees, and
    these applications make heavy use of the search ioctls. This fixes their
    issues.

    USB: core: add helpers to retrieve endpoints
    
    commit 66a359390e7e34f9a4c489467234b107b3d76169 upstream.
    
    Many USB drivers iterate over the available endpoints to find required
    endpoints of a specific type and direction. Typically the endpoints are
    required for proper function and a missing endpoint should abort probe.
    
    To facilitate code reuse, add a helper to retrieve common endpoints
    (bulk or interrupt, in or out) and four wrappers to find a single
    endpoint.
    
    Note that the helpers are marked as __must_check to serve as a reminder
    to always verify that all expected endpoints are indeed present. This
    also means that any optional endpoints, typically need to be looked up
    through separate calls.

    iio:accel:mma8452: Fix timestamp alignment and prevent data leak.
    
    commit 89226a296d816727405d3fea684ef69e7d388bd8 upstream.
    
    One of a class of bugs pointed out by Lars in a recent review.
    iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp assumes the buffer used is aligned
    to the size of the timestamp (8 bytes).  This is not guaranteed in
    this driver which uses a 16 byte u8 array on the stack.  As Lars also noted
    this anti pattern can involve a leak of data to userspace and that
    indeed can happen here.  We close both issues by moving to
    a suitable structure in the iio_priv() data with alignment
    ensured by use of an explicit c structure.  This data is allocated
    with kzalloc so no data can leak appart from previous readings.
    
    The additional forcing of the 8 byte alignment of the timestamp
    is not strictly necessary but makes the code less fragile by
    making this explicit.

    ALSA: hda: fix a runtime pm issue in SOF when integrated GPU is disabled
    
    [ Upstream commit 13774d81f38538c5fa2924bdcdfa509155480fa6 ]
    
    In snd_hdac_device_init pm_runtime_set_active is called to
    increase child_count in parent device. But when it is failed
    to build connection with GPU for one case that integrated
    graphic gpu is disabled, snd_hdac_ext_bus_device_exit will be
    invoked to clean up a HD-audio extended codec base device. At
    this time the child_count of parent is not decreased, which
    makes parent device can't get suspended.
    
    This patch calls pm_runtime_set_suspended to decrease child_count
    in parent device in snd_hdac_device_exit to match with
    snd_hdac_device_init. pm_runtime_set_suspended can make sure that
    it will not decrease child_count if the device is already suspended.

    drivers/net/wan/hdlc_cisco: Add hard_header_len
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a545ebe380bf4c1433e3c136e35a77764fda5ad ]
    
    This driver didn't set hard_header_len. This patch sets hard_header_len
    for it according to its header_ops->create function.
    
    This driver's header_ops->create function (cisco_hard_header) creates
    a header of (struct hdlc_header), so hard_header_len should be set to
    sizeof(struct hdlc_header).

    drivers/net/wan/lapbether: Set network_header before transmitting
    
    [ Upstream commit 91244d108441013b7367b3b4dcc6869998676473 ]
    
    Set the skb's network_header before it is passed to the underlying
    Ethernet device for transmission.
    
    This patch fixes the following issue:
    
    When we use this driver with AF_PACKET sockets, there would be error
    messages of:
       protocol 0805 is buggy, dev (Ethernet interface name)
    printed in the system "dmesg" log.
    
    This is because skbs passed down to the Ethernet device for transmission
    don't have their network_header properly set, and the dev_queue_xmit_nit
    function in net/core/dev.c complains about this.
    
    Reason of setting the network_header to this place (at the end of the
    Ethernet header, and at the beginning of the Ethernet payload):
    
    Because when this driver receives an skb from the Ethernet device, the
    network_header is also set at this place.

    [ Upstream commit 1ee39c1448c4e0d480c5b390e2db1987561fb5c2 ]
    
    The underlying Ethernet device may request necessary tailroom to be
    allocated by setting needed_tailroom. This driver should also set
    needed_tailroom to request the tailroom needed by the underlying
    Ethernet device to be allocated.

    scsi: libsas: Set data_dir as DMA_NONE if libata marks qc as NODATA
    
    [ Upstream commit 53de092f47ff40e8d4d78d590d95819d391bf2e0 ]
    
    It was discovered that sdparm will fail when attempting to disable write
    cache on a SATA disk connected via libsas.
    
    In the ATA command set the write cache state is controlled through the SET
    FEATURES operation. This is roughly corresponds to MODE SELECT in SCSI and
    the latter command is what is used in the SCSI-ATA translation layer. A
    subtle difference is that a MODE SELECT carries data whereas SET FEATURES
    is defined as a non-data command in ATA.
    
    Set the DMA data direction to DMA_NONE if the requested ATA command is
    identified as non-data.
