    crypto: padlock-aes - Fix Nano workaround data corruption
    
    commit 46d8c4b28652d35dc6cfb5adf7f54e102fc04384 upstream.
    
    This was detected by the self-test thanks to Ard's chunking patch.
    
    I finally got around to testing this out on my ancient Via box.  It
    turns out that the workaround got the assembly wrong and we end up
    doing count + initial cycles of the loop instead of just count.
    
    This obviously causes corruption, either by overwriting the source
    that is yet to be processed, or writing over the end of the buffer.
    
    On CPUs that don't require the workaround only ECB is affected.
    On Nano CPUs both ECB and CBC are affected.
    
    This patch fixes it by doing the subtraction prior to the assembly.

    kvm: x86: vmx: fix vpid leak
    
    commit 63aff65573d73eb8dda4732ad4ef222dd35e4862 upstream.
    
    VPID for the nested vcpu is allocated at vmx_create_vcpu whenever nested
    vmx is turned on with the module parameter.
    
    However, it's only freed if the L1 guest has executed VMXON which is not
    a given.
    
    As a result, on a system with nested==on every creation+deletion of an
    L1 vcpu without running an L2 guest results in leaking one vpid.  Since
    the total number of vpids is limited to 64k, they can eventually get
    exhausted, preventing L2 from starting.
    
    Delay allocation of the L2 vpid until VMXON emulation, thus matching its
    freeing.

    with _mapcount=-256, but private=0.
    
    It's caused by the race between migration and ballooning, and lock

    fragment is inside the fragment table.  The end result _is_ verified to
    be inside the image when actually reading the fragment data, but before
    that is done, we may end up taking a page fault because the fragment

    [ Upstream commit 56e2c94f055d328f5f6b0a5c1721cca2f2d4e0a1 ]
    
    We currently check current frags memory usage only when
    a new frag queue is created. This allows attackers to first
    consume the memory budget (default : 4 MB) creating thousands
    of frag queues, then sending tiny skbs to exceed high_thresh
    limit by 2 to 3 order of magnitude.
    
    Note that before commit 648700f76b03 ("inet: frags: use rhashtables
    for reassembly units"), work queue could be starved under DOS,
    getting no cpu cycles.
    After commit 648700f76b03, only the per frag queue timer can eventually
    remove an incomplete frag queue and its skbs.

    NET: stmmac: align DMA stuff to largest cache line length
    
    [ Upstream commit 9939a46d90c6c76f4533d534dbadfa7b39dc6acc ]
    
    As for today STMMAC_ALIGN macro (which is used to align DMA stuff)
    relies on L1 line length (L1_CACHE_BYTES).
    This isn't correct in case of system with several cache levels
    which might have L1 cache line length smaller than L2 line. This
    can lead to sharing one cache line between DMA buffer and other
    data, so we can lose this data while invalidate DMA buffer before
    DMA transaction.
    
    Fix that by using SMP_CACHE_BYTES instead of L1_CACHE_BYTES for
    aligning.

    [ Upstream commit 822fb18a82abaf4ee7058793d95d340f5dab7bfc ]
    
    When loading module manually, after call xenbus_switch_state to initializes
    the state of the netfront device, the driver state did not change so fast
    that may lead no dev created in latest kernel. This patch adds wait to make
    sure xenbus knows the driver is not in closed/unknown state.
    
    Current state:
    [vm]# ethtool eth0
    Settings for eth0:
            Link detected: yes
    [vm]# modprobe -r xen_netfront
    [vm]# modprobe  xen_netfront
    [vm]# ethtool eth0
    Settings for eth0:
    Cannot get device settings: No such device
    Cannot get wake-on-lan settings: No such device
    Cannot get message level: No such device
    Cannot get link status: No such device
    No data available
    
    With the patch installed.
    [vm]# ethtool eth0
    Settings for eth0:

    net: lan78xx: fix rx handling before first packet is send
    
    [ Upstream commit 136f55f660192ce04af091642efc75d85e017364 ]
    
    As long the bh tasklet isn't scheduled once, no packet from the rx path
    will be handled. Since the tx path also schedule the same tasklet
    this situation only persits until the first packet transmission.
    So fix this issue by scheduling the tasklet after link reset.

    ext4: check for allocation block validity with block group locked
    
    commit 8d5a803c6a6ce4ec258e31f76059ea5153ba46ef upstream.
    
    With commit 044e6e3d74a3: "ext4: don't update checksum of new
    initialized bitmaps" the buffer valid bit will get set without
    actually setting up the checksum for the allocation bitmap, since the
    checksum will get calculated once we actually allocate an inode or
    block.
    
    If we are doing this, then we need to (re-)check the verified bit
    after we take the block group lock.  Otherwise, we could race with
    another process reading and verifying the bitmap, which would then
    complain about the checksum being invalid.

    ext4: fix inline data updates with checksums enabled
    
    commit 362eca70b53389bddf3143fe20f53dcce2cfdf61 upstream.
    
    The inline data code was updating the raw inode directly; this is
    problematic since if metadata checksums are enabled,
    ext4_mark_inode_dirty() must be called to update the inode's checksum.
    In addition, the jbd2 layer requires that get_write_access() be called
    before the metadata buffer is modified.  Fix both of these problems.

    squashfs: be more careful about metadata corruption
    
    commit 01cfb7937a9af2abb1136c7e89fbf3fd92952956 upstream.
    
    Anatoly Trosinenko reports that a corrupted squashfs image can cause a
    kernel oops.  It turns out that squashfs can end up being confused about
    negative fragment lengths.
    
    The regular squashfs_read_data() does check for negative lengths, but
    squashfs_read_metadata() did not, and the fragment size code just
    blindly trusted the on-disk value.  Fix both the fragment parsing and
    the metadata reading code.

    random: mix rdrand with entropy sent in from userspace
    
    commit 81e69df38e2911b642ec121dec319fad2a4782f3 upstream.
    
    Fedora has integrated the jitter entropy daemon to work around slow
    boot problems, especially on VM's that don't support virtio-rng:
    
        https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1572944
    
    It's understandable why they did this, but the Jitter entropy daemon
    works fundamentally on the principle: "the CPU microarchitecture is
    **so** complicated and we can't figure it out, so it *must* be
    random".  Yes, it uses statistical tests to "prove" it is secure, but
    AES_ENCRYPT(NSA_KEY, COUNTER++) will also pass statistical tests with
    flying colors.
    
    So if RDRAND is available, mix it into entropy submitted from
    userspace.  It can't hurt, and if you believe the NSA has backdoored
    RDRAND, then they probably have enough details about the Intel
    microarchitecture that they can reverse engineer how the Jitter
    entropy daemon affects the microarchitecture, and attack its output
    stream.  And if RDRAND is in fact an honest DRNG, it will immeasurably
    improve on what the Jitter entropy daemon might produce.
    
    This also provides some protection against someone who is able to read
    or set the entropy seed file.

    Hardware could time out Fastpath IOs one second earlier than the timeout
    provided by the host.
    
    For non-RAID devices, driver provides timeout value based on OS provided

    audit: allow not equal op for audit by executable
    
    [ Upstream commit 23bcc480dac204c7dbdf49d96b2c918ed98223c2 ]
    
    Current implementation of auditing by executable name only implements
    the 'equal' operator. This patch extends it to also support the 'not
    equal' operator.

    rsi: Fix 'invalid vdd' warning in mmc
    
    [ Upstream commit 78e450719c702784e42af6da912d3692fd3da0cb ]
    
    While performing cleanup, driver is messing with card->ocr
    value by not masking rocr against ocr_avail. Below panic
    is observed with some of the SDIO host controllers due to
    this. Issue is resolved by reverting incorrect modifications
    to vdd.

    ipconfig: Correctly initialise ic_nameservers
    
    [ Upstream commit 300eec7c0a2495f771709c7642aa15f7cc148b83 ]
    
    ic_nameservers, which stores the list of name servers discovered by
    ipconfig, is initialised (i.e. has all of its elements set to NONE, or
    0xffffffff) by ic_nameservers_predef() in the following scenarios:
    
     - before the "ip=" and "nfsaddrs=" kernel command line parameters are
       parsed (in ip_auto_config_setup());
     - before autoconfiguring via DHCP or BOOTP (in ic_bootp_init()), in
       order to clear any values that may have been set after parsing "ip="
       or "nfsaddrs=" and are no longer needed.
    
    This means that ic_nameservers_predef() is not called when neither "ip="
    nor "nfsaddrs=" is specified on the kernel command line. In this
    scenario, every element in ic_nameservers remains set to 0x00000000,
    which is indistinguishable from ANY and causes pnp_seq_show() to write
    the following (bogus) information to /proc/net/pnp:
    
      #MANUAL
      nameserver 0.0.0.0
      nameserver 0.0.0.0
      nameserver 0.0.0.0
    
    This is potentially problematic for systems that blindly link
    /etc/resolv.conf to /proc/net/pnp.
    
    Ensure that ic_nameservers is also initialised when neither "ip=" nor
    "nfsaddrs=" are specified by calling ic_nameservers_predef() in
    ip_auto_config(), but only when ip_auto_config_setup() was not called
    earlier. This causes the following to be written to /proc/net/pnp, and
    is consistent with what gets written when ipconfig is configured
    manually but no name servers are specified on the kernel command line:
    
      #MANUAL

    drm/gma500: fix psb_intel_lvds_mode_valid()'s return type
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ea009095c6e7396915a1d0dd480c41f02985f79 ]
    
    The method struct drm_connector_helper_funcs::mode_valid is defined
    as returning an 'enum drm_mode_status' but the driver implementation
    for this method, psb_intel_lvds_mode_valid(), uses an 'int' for it.
    
    Fix this by using 'enum drm_mode_status' for psb_intel_lvds_mode_valid().

    memory: tegra: Apply interrupts mask per SoC
    
    [ Upstream commit 1c74d5c0de0c2cc29fef97a19251da2ad6f579bd ]
    
    Currently we are enabling handling of interrupts specific to Tegra124+
    which happen to overlap with previous generations. Let's specify
    interrupts mask per SoC generation for consistency and in a preparation
    of squashing of Tegra20 driver into the common one that will enable
    handling of GART faults which may be undesirable by newer generations.

    memory: tegra: Do not handle spurious interrupts
    
    [ Upstream commit bf3fbdfbec947cdd04b2f2c4bce11534c8786eee ]
    
    The ISR reads interrupts-enable mask, but doesn't utilize it. Apply the
    mask to the interrupt status and don't handle interrupts that MC driver
    haven't asked for. Kernel would disable spurious MC IRQ and report the
    error. This would happen only in a case of a very severe bug.

    drm/atomic: Handling the case when setting old crtc for plane
    
    [ Upstream commit fc2a69f3903dfd97cd47f593e642b47918c949df ]
    
    In the func drm_atomic_set_crtc_for_plane, with the current code,
    if crtc of the plane_state and crtc passed as argument to the func
    are same, entire func will executed in vein.
    It will get state of crtc and clear and set the bits in plane_mask.
    All these steps are not required for same old crtc.
    Ideally, we should do nothing in this case, this patch handles the same,
    and causes the program to return without doing anything in such scenario.

    scsi: 3w-xxxx: fix a missing-check bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 9899e4d3523faaef17c67141aa80ff2088f17871 ]
    
    In tw_chrdev_ioctl(), the length of the data buffer is firstly copied
    from the userspace pointer 'argp' and saved to the kernel object
    'data_buffer_length'. Then a security check is performed on it to make
    sure that the length is not more than 'TW_MAX_IOCTL_SECTORS *
    512'. Otherwise, an error code -EINVAL is returned. If the security
    check is passed, the entire ioctl command is copied again from the
    'argp' pointer and saved to the kernel object 'tw_ioctl'. Then, various
    operations are performed on 'tw_ioctl' according to the 'cmd'. Given
    that the 'argp' pointer resides in userspace, a malicious userspace
    process can race to change the buffer length between the two
    copies. This way, the user can bypass the security check and inject
    invalid data buffer length. This can cause potential security issues in
    the following execution.
    
    This patch checks for capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) in tw_chrdev_open() to
    avoid the above issues.

    In twa_chrdev_ioctl(), the ioctl driver command is firstly copied from
    the userspace pointer 'argp' and saved to the kernel object
    'driver_command'.  Then a security check is performed on the data buffer
    size indicated by 'driver_command', which is
    'driver_command.buffer_length'. If the security check is passed, the
    entire ioctl command is copied again from the 'argp' pointer and saved
    to the kernel object 'tw_ioctl'. Then, various operations are performed
    on 'tw_ioctl' according to the 'cmd'. Given that the 'argp' pointer
    resides in userspace, a malicious userspace process can race to change
    the buffer size between the two copies. This way, the user can bypass
    the security check and inject invalid data buffer size. This can cause
    potential security issues in the following execution.
    
    This patch checks for capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) in twa_chrdev_open()t o
    avoid the above issues.

    perf: fix invalid bit in diagnostic entry
    
    [ Upstream commit 3c0a83b14ea71fef5ccc93a3bd2de5f892be3194 ]
    
    The s390 CPU measurement facility sampling mode supports basic entries
    and diagnostic entries. Each entry has a valid bit to indicate the
    status of the entry as valid or invalid.
    
    This bit is bit 31 in the diagnostic entry, but the bit mask definition
    refers to bit 30.
    
    Fix this by making the reserved field one bit larger.

    s390/cpum_sf: Add data entry sizes to sampling trailer entry
    
    [ Upstream commit 77715b7ddb446bd39a06f3376e85f4bb95b29bb8 ]
    
    The CPU Measurement sampling facility creates a trailer entry for each
    Sample-Data-Block of stored samples. The trailer entry contains the sizes
    (in bytes) of the stored sampling types:
     - basic-sampling data entry size
     - diagnostic-sampling data entry size
    Both sizes are 2 bytes long.
    
    This patch changes the trailer entry definition to reflect this.

    brcmfmac: Add support for bcm43364 wireless chipset
    
    [ Upstream commit 9c4a121e82634aa000a702c98cd6f05b27d6e186 ]
    
    Add support for the BCM43364 chipset via an SDIO interface, as used in
    e.g. the Murata 1FX module.
    
    The BCM43364 uses the same firmware as the BCM43430 (which is already
    included), the only difference is the omission of Bluetooth.
    
    However, the SDIO_ID for the BCM43364 is 02D0:A9A4, giving it a MODALIAS
    of sdio:c00v02D0dA9A4, which doesn't get recognised and hence doesn't
    load the brcmfmac module. Adding the 'A9A4' ID in the appropriate place
    triggers the brcmfmac driver to load, and then correctly use the
    firmware file 'brcmfmac43430-sdio.bin'.

    [ Upstream commit 0cc4655cb57af0b7e105d075c4f83f8046efafe7 ]
    
    This issue was reported by a user who downloaded a corrupt saa7164
    firmware, then went looking for a valid xc5000 firmware to fix the
    error displayed...but the device in question has no xc5000, thus after
    much effort, the wild goose chase eventually led to a support call.
    
    The xc5000 has nothing to do with saa7164 (as far as I can tell),
    so replace the string with saa7164 as well as give a meaningful
    hint on the firmware mismatch.

    For failed commands with valid sense data (e.g. NCQ commands),
    scsi_check_sense() is used in ata_analyze_tf() to determine if the
    command can be retried. In such case, rely on this decision and ignore
    the command error mask based decision done in ata_worth_retry().
    
    This fixes useless retries of commands such as unaligned writes on zoned

    tty: Fix data race in tty_insert_flip_string_fixed_flag
    
    [ Upstream commit b6da31b2c07c46f2dcad1d86caa835227a16d9ff ]
    
    Unlike normal serials, in pty layer, there is no guarantee that multiple
    threads don't insert input characters at the same time. If it is happened,
    tty_insert_flip_string_fixed_flag can be executed concurrently. This can
    lead slab out-of-bounds write in tty_insert_flip_string_fixed_flag.
    
    Call sequences are as follows.
    CPU0                                    CPU1
    n_tty_ioctl_helper                      n_tty_ioctl_helper
    __start_tty                             tty_send_xchar
    tty_wakeup                              pty_write
    n_hdlc_tty_wakeup                       tty_insert_flip_string
    n_hdlc_send_frames                      tty_insert_flip_string_fixed_flag
    pty_write
    tty_insert_flip_string
    tty_insert_flip_string_fixed_flag
    
    To fix the race, acquire port->lock in pty_write() before it inserts input
    characters to tty buffer. It prevents multiple threads from inserting
    input characters concurrently.
    
    The crash log is as follows:

    powerpc/embedded6xx/hlwd-pic: Prevent interrupts from being handled by Starlet
    
    [ Upstream commit 9dcb3df4281876731e4e8bff7940514d72375154 ]
    
    The interrupt controller inside the Wii's Hollywood chip is connected to
    two masters, the "Broadway" PowerPC and the "Starlet" ARM926, each with
    their own interrupt status and mask registers.
    
    When booting the Wii with mini[1], interrupts from the SD card
    controller (IRQ 7) are handled by the ARM, because mini provides SD
    access over IPC. Linux however can't currently use or disable this IPC
    service, so both sides try to handle IRQ 7 without coordination.
    
    Let's instead make sure that all interrupts that are unmasked on the PPC
    side are masked on the ARM side; this will also make sure that Linux can
    properly talk to the SD card controller (and potentially other devices).
    
    If access to a device through IPC is desired in the future, interrupts
    from that device should not be handled by Linux directly.

    media: smiapp: fix timeout checking in smiapp_read_nvm
    
    [ Upstream commit 7a2148dfda8001c983f0effd9afd8a7fa58e99c4 ]
    
    The current code decrements the timeout counter i and the end of
    each loop i is incremented, so the check for timeout will always
    be false and hence the timeout mechanism is just a dead code path.
    Potentially, if the RD_READY bit is not set, we could end up in
    an infinite loop.
    
    Fix this so the timeout starts from 1000 and decrements to zero,
    if at the end of the loop i is zero we have a timeout condition.
    
    Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1324008 ("Logically dead code")

    For raid6, when two disk of the array are offline, two spare disks can
    be added into the array. Before spare disks recovery completing,
    system reboot and mdadm thinks it is ok to restart the degraded
    array by md_ioctl(). Since disks in raid6 is not only_parity(),
    raid5_run() will abort, when there is no PPL feature or not setting
    'start_dirty_degraded' parameter. Therefore, mddev->pers is NULL.
    
    But, mddev->raid_disks has been set and it will not be cleared when
    raid5_run abort. md_ioctl() can execute cmd 'HOT_REMOVE_DISK' to
    remove a disk by mdadm, which will cause NULL pointer dereference
    in remove_and_add_spares() finally.

    scsi: ufs: fix exception event handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e3611e9546c2ed4def152a51dfd34e8dddae7a5 ]
    
    The device can set the exception event bit in one of the response UPIU,
    for example to notify the need for urgent BKOPs operation.  In such a
    case, the host driver calls ufshcd_exception_event_handler to handle
    this notification.  When trying to check the exception event status (for
    finding the cause for the exception event), the device may be busy with
    additional SCSI commands handling and may not respond within the 100ms
    timeout.
    
    To prevent that, we need to block SCSI commands during handling of
    exception events and allow retransmissions of the query requests, in
    case of timeout.

    Request control of native PCIe hotplug only if the pciehp driver is

    btrfs: qgroup: Finish rescan when hit the last leaf of extent tree
    
    [ Upstream commit ff3d27a048d926b3920ccdb75d98788c567cae0d ]
    
    Under the following case, qgroup rescan can double account cowed tree
    blocks:
    
    In this case, extent tree only has one tree block.
    
    -
    | transid=5 last committed=4
    | btrfs_qgroup_rescan_worker()
    | |- btrfs_start_transaction()
    | |  transid = 5
    | |- qgroup_rescan_leaf()
    |    |- btrfs_search_slot_for_read() on extent tree
    |       Get the only extent tree block from commit root (transid = 4).
    |       Scan it, set qgroup_rescan_progress to the last
    |       EXTENT/META_ITEM + 1
    |       now qgroup_rescan_progress = A + 1.
    |
    | fs tree get CoWed, new tree block is at A + 16K
    | transid 5 get committed
    -
    | transid=6 last committed=5
    | btrfs_qgroup_rescan_worker()
    | btrfs_qgroup_rescan_worker()
    | |- btrfs_start_transaction()
    | |  transid = 5
    | |- qgroup_rescan_leaf()
    |    |- btrfs_search_slot_for_read() on extent tree
    |       Get the only extent tree block from commit root (transid = 5).
    |       scan it using qgroup_rescan_progress (A + 1).
    |       found new tree block beyong A, and it's fs tree block,
    |       account it to increase qgroup numbers.
    -
    
    In above case, tree block A, and tree block A + 16K get accounted twice,
    while qgroup rescan should stop when it already reach the last leaf,
    other than continue using its qgroup_rescan_progress.
    
    Such case could happen by just looping btrfs/017 and with some
    possibility it can hit such double qgroup accounting problem.
    
    Fix it by checking the path to determine if we should finish qgroup
    rescan, other than relying on next loop to exit.

    btrfs: add barriers to btrfs_sync_log before log_commit_wait wakeups
    
    [ Upstream commit 3d3a2e610ea5e7c6d4f9481ecce5d8e2d8317843 ]
    
    Currently the code assumes that there's an implied barrier by the
    sequence of code preceding the wakeup, namely the mutex unlock.
    
    As Nikolay pointed out:
    
    I think this is wrong (not your code) but the original assumption that
    the RELEASE semantics provided by mutex_unlock is sufficient.
    According to memory-barriers.txt:
    
    Section 'LOCK ACQUISITION FUNCTIONS' states:
    
     (2) RELEASE operation implication:
    
         Memory operations issued before the RELEASE will be completed before the
         RELEASE operation has completed.
    
         Memory operations issued after the RELEASE *may* be completed before the
         RELEASE operation has completed.
    
    (I've bolded the may portion)
    
    The example given there:
    
    As an example, consider the following:
    
        *A = a;
        *B = b;
        ACQUIRE
        *C = c;
        *D = d;
        RELEASE
        *E = e;
        *F = f;
    
    The following sequence of events is acceptable:
    
        ACQUIRE, {*F,*A}, *E, {*C,*D}, *B, RELEASE
    
    So if we assume that *C is modifying the flag which the waitqueue is checking,
    and *E is the actual wakeup, then those accesses can be re-ordered...
    
    IMHO this code should be considered broken...

    media: videobuf2-core: don't call memop 'finish' when queueing
    
    [ Upstream commit 90b2da89a083e1395cb322521a42397c49ae4500 ]
    
    When a buffer is queued or requeued in vb2_buffer_done, then don't
    call the finish memop. In this case the buffer is only returned to vb2,
    not to userspace.
    
    Calling 'finish' here will cause an unbalance when the queue is
    canceled, since the core will call the same memop again.

    In this case the system was crashing in wl1271_suspend() as platform

    [ Upstream commit b817047ae70c0bd67b677b65d0d69d72cd6e9728 ]
    
    Race condition is observed during rmmod of mwifiex_usb:
    
    1. The rmmod thread will call mwifiex_usb_disconnect(), download
       SHUTDOWN command and do wait_event_interruptible_timeout(),
       waiting for response.
    
    2. The main thread will handle the response and will do a
       wake_up_interruptible(), unblocking rmmod thread.
    
    3. On getting unblocked, rmmod thread  will make rx_cmd.urb = NULL in
       mwifiex_usb_free().
    
    4. The main thread will try to resubmit rx_cmd.urb in
       mwifiex_usb_submit_rx_urb(), which is NULL.
    
    To fix, wait for main thread to complete before calling
    mwifiex_usb_free().

    Bluetooth: hci_qca: Fix "Sleep inside atomic section" warning
    
    [ Upstream commit 9960521c44a5d828f29636ceac0600603ecbddbf ]
    
    This patch fixes the following warning during boot:
    
     do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING; state=1 set at
     [<(ptrval)>] qca_setup+0x194/0x750 [hci_uart]
     WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 1878 at kernel/sched/core.c:6135
     __might_sleep+0x7c/0x88
    
    In qca_set_baudrate(), the current task state is set to
    TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE before going to sleep for 300ms. It was then
    restored to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE. This patch sets the current task state
    back to TASK_RUNNING instead.

    iwlwifi: pcie: fix race in Rx buffer allocator
    
    [ Upstream commit 0f22e40053bd5378ad1e3250e65c574fd61c0cd6 ]
    
    Make sure the rx_allocator worker is canceled before running the
    rx_init routine.  rx_init frees and re-allocates all rxb's pages.  The
    rx_allocator worker also allocates pages for the used rxb's.  Running
    rx_init and rx_allocator simultaniously causes a kernel panic.  Fix
    that by canceling the work in rx_init.

    powerpc/64s: Fix compiler store ordering to SLB shadow area
    
    [ Upstream commit 926bc2f100c24d4842b3064b5af44ae964c1d81c ]
    
    The stores to update the SLB shadow area must be made as they appear
    in the C code, so that the hypervisor does not see an entry with
    mismatched vsid and esid. Use WRITE_ONCE for this.
    
    GCC has been observed to elide the first store to esid in the update,
    which means that if the hypervisor interrupts the guest after storing
    to vsid, it could see an entry with old esid and new vsid, which may
    possibly result in memory corruption.

    hvc_opal: don't set tb_ticks_per_usec in udbg_init_opal_common()
    
    [ Upstream commit 447808bf500a7cc92173266a59f8a494e132b122 ]
    
    time_init() will set up tb_ticks_per_usec based on reality.
    time_init() is called *after* udbg_init_opal_common() during boot.
    
    from arch/powerpc/kernel/time.c:
      unsigned long tb_ticks_per_usec = 100; /* sane default */
    
    Currently, all powernv systems have a timebase frequency of 512mhz
    (512000000/1000000 == 0x200) - although there's nothing written
    down anywhere that I can find saying that we couldn't make that
    different based on the requirements in the ISA.
    
    So, we've been (accidentally) thwacking the (currently) correct
    (for powernv at least) value for tb_ticks_per_usec earlier than
    we otherwise would have.
    
    The "sane default" seems to be adequate for our purposes between
    udbg_init_opal_common() and time_init() being called, and if it isn't,
    then we should probably be setting it somewhere that isn't hvc_opal.c!

    infiniband: fix a possible use-after-free bug
    
    [ Upstream commit cb2595c1393b4a5211534e6f0a0fbad369e21ad8 ]
    
    ucma_process_join() will free the new allocated "mc" struct,
    if there is any error after that, especially the copy_to_user().
    
    But in parallel, ucma_leave_multicast() could find this "mc"
    through idr_find() before ucma_process_join() frees it, since it
    is already published.
    
    So "mc" could be used in ucma_leave_multicast() after it is been
    allocated and freed in ucma_process_join(), since we don't refcnt
    it.
    
    Fix this by separating "publish" from ID allocation, so that we
    can get an ID first and publish it later after copy_to_user().

    [ Upstream commit bd975e691486ba52790ba23cc9b4fecab7bc0d31 ]
    
    When listing sets with timeout support, there's a probability that
    just timing out entries with "0" timeout value is listed/saved.
    However when restoring the saved list, the zero timeout value means
    permanent elelements.
    
    The new behaviour is that timing out entries are listed with "timeout 1"
    instead of zero.

    [ Upstream commit f3c01d2f3ade6790db67f80fef60df84424f8964 ]
    
    Currently, __vunmap flow is,
     1) Release the VM area
     2) Free the debug objects corresponding to that vm area.
    
    This leave some race window open.
     1) Release the VM area
     1.5) Some other client gets the same vm area
     1.6) This client allocates new debug objects on the same
          vm area
     2) Free the debug objects corresponding to this vm area.
    
    Here, we actually free 'other' client's debug objects.
    
    Fix this by freeing the debug objects first and then releasing the VM
    area.

    nfsd: fix potential use-after-free in nfsd4_decode_getdeviceinfo
    
    [ Upstream commit 3171822fdcdd6e6d536047c425af6dc7a92dc585 ]
    
    When running a fuzz tester against a KASAN-enabled kernel, the following
    splat periodically occurs.
    
    The problem occurs when the test sends a GETDEVICEINFO request with a
    malformed xdr array (size but no data) for gdia_notify_types and the
    array size is > 0x3fffffff, which results in an overflow in the value of
    nbytes which is passed to read_buf().
    
    If the array size is 0x40000000, 0x80000000, or 0xc0000000, then after
    the overflow occurs, the value of nbytes 0, and when that happens the
    pointer returned by read_buf() points to the end of the xdr data (i.e.
    argp->end) when really it should be returning NULL.
    
    Fix this by returning NFS4ERR_BAD_XDR if the array size is > 1000 (this
    value is arbitrary, but it's the same threshold used by
    nfsd4_decode_bitmap()... in could really be any value >= 1 since it's
    expected to get at most a single bitmap in gdia_notify_types).

    xen/netfront: raise max number of slots in xennet_get_responses()
    
    [ Upstream commit 57f230ab04d2910a06d17d988f1c4d7586a59113 ]
    
    The max number of slots used in xennet_get_responses() is set to
    MAX_SKB_FRAGS + (rx->status <= RX_COPY_THRESHOLD).
    
    In old kernel-xen MAX_SKB_FRAGS was 18, while nowadays it is 17. This
    difference is resulting in frequent messages "too many slots" and a
    reduced network throughput for some workloads (factor 10 below that of
    a kernel-xen based guest).
    
    Replacing MAX_SKB_FRAGS by XEN_NETIF_NR_SLOTS_MIN for calculation of
    the max number of slots to use solves that problem (tests showed no
    more messages "too many slots" and throughput was as high as with the
    kernel-xen based guest system).
    
    Replace MAX_SKB_FRAGS-2 by XEN_NETIF_NR_SLOTS_MIN-1 in
    netfront_tx_slot_available() for making it clearer what is really being
    tested without actually modifying the tested value.

    tracing: Quiet gcc warning about maybe unused link variable
    
    commit 2519c1bbe38d7acacc9aacba303ca6f97482ed53 upstream.
    
    Commit 57ea2a34adf4 ("tracing/kprobes: Fix trace_probe flags on
    enable_trace_kprobe() failure") added an if statement that depends on another
    if statement that gcc doesn't see will initialize the "link" variable and
    gives the warning:
    
     "warning: 'link' may be used uninitialized in this function"
    
    It is really a false positive, but to quiet the warning, and also to make
    sure that it never actually is used uninitialized, initialize the "link"
    variable to NULL and add an if (!WARN_ON_ONCE(!link)) where the compiler
    thinks it could be used uninitialized.

    tracing/kprobes: Fix trace_probe flags on enable_trace_kprobe() failure
    
    commit 57ea2a34adf40f3a6e88409aafcf803b8945619a upstream.
    
    If enable_trace_kprobe fails to enable the probe in enable_k(ret)probe
    it returns an error, but does not unset the tp flags it set previously.
    This results in a probe being considered enabled and failures like being
    unable to remove the probe through kprobe_events file since probes_open()
    expects every probe to be disabled.

    tracing: Fix possible double free in event_enable_trigger_func()
    
    commit 15cc78644d0075e76d59476a4467e7143860f660 upstream.
    
    There was a case that triggered a double free in event_trigger_callback()
    due to the called reg() function freeing the trigger_data and then it
    getting freed again by the error return by the caller. The solution there
    was to up the trigger_data ref count.
    
    Code inspection found that event_enable_trigger_func() has the same issue,
    but is not as easy to trigger (requires harder to trigger failures). It
    needs to be solved slightly different as it needs more to clean up when the
    reg() function fails.

    The cause is because the register_snapshot_trigger() call failed to
    allocate the snapshot buffer, and then called unregister_trigger()
    which freed the data that was passed to it. Then on return to the
    function that called register_snapshot_trigger(), as it sees it
    failed to register, it frees the trigger_data again and causes
    a double free.
    
    By calling event_trigger_init() on the trigger_data (which only ups
    the reference counter for it), and then event_trigger_free() afterward,
    the trigger_data would not get freed by the registering trigger function
    as it would only up and lower the ref count for it. If the register
    trigger function fails, then the event_trigger_free() called after it
    will free the trigger data normally.

    commit 384cf4285b34e08917e3e66603382f2b0c4f6e1b upstream.
    
    The Lenovo LaVie Z laptop requires i8042 to be reset in order to
    consistently detect its Elantech touchpad. The nomux and kbdreset
    quirks are not sufficient.
    
    It's possible the other LaVie Z models from NEC require this as well.

    MIPS: Fix off-by-one in pci_resource_to_user()
    
    commit 38c0a74fe06da3be133cae3fb7bde6a9438e698b upstream.
    
    The MIPS implementation of pci_resource_to_user() introduced in v3.12 by
    commit 4c2924b725fb ("MIPS: PCI: Use pci_resource_to_user to map pci
    memory space properly") incorrectly sets *end to the address of the
    byte after the resource, rather than the last byte of the resource.
    
    This results in userland seeing resources as a byte larger than they
    actually are, for example a 32 byte BAR will be reported by a tool such
    as lspci as being 33 bytes in size:
    
        Region 2: I/O ports at 1000 [disabled] [size=33]
    
    Correct this by subtracting one from the calculated end address,
    reporting the correct address to userland.
