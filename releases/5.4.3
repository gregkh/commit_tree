    kselftest: Fix NULL INSTALL_PATH for TARGETS runlist
    
    [ Upstream commit 02bf1f8b3c43eec5053c35c14fb9f138186b4123 ]
    
    As per commit 131b30c94fbc ("kselftest: exclude failed TARGETS from
    runlist") failed targets were excluded from the runlist. But value
    $$INSTALL_PATH is always NULL. It should be $INSTALL_PATH instead
    $$INSTALL_PATH.
    
    So, fix Makefile to use $INSTALL_PATH.

    EDAC/ghes: Fix locking and memory barrier issues
    
    [ Upstream commit 23f61b9fc5cc10d87f66e50518707eec2a0fbda1 ]
    
    The ghes registration and refcount is broken in several ways:
    
     * ghes_edac_register() returns with success for a 2nd instance
       even if a first instance's registration is still running. This is
       not correct as the first instance may fail later. A subsequent
       registration may not finish before the first. Parallel registrations
       must be avoided.
    
     * The refcount was increased even if a registration failed. This
       leads to stale counters preventing the device from being released.
    
     * The ghes refcount may not be decremented properly on unregistration.
       Always decrement the refcount once ghes_edac_unregister() is called to
       keep the refcount sane.
    
     * The ghes_pvt pointer is handed to the irq handler before registration
       finished.
    
     * The mci structure could be freed while the irq handler is running.
    
    Fix this by adding a mutex to ghes_edac_register(). This mutex
    serializes instances to register and unregister. The refcount is only
    increased if the registration succeeded. This makes sure the refcount is
    in a consistent state after registering or unregistering a device.
    
    Note: A spinlock cannot be used here as the code section may sleep.
    
    The ghes_pvt is protected by ghes_lock now. This ensures the pointer is
    not updated before registration was finished or while the irq handler is
    running. It is unset before unregistering the device including necessary
    (implicit) memory barriers making the changes visible to other CPUs.
    Thus, the device can not be used anymore by an interrupt.
    
    Also, rename ghes_init to ghes_refcount for better readability and
    switch to refcount API.
    
    A refcount is needed because there can be multiple GHES structures being
    defined (see ACPI 6.3 specification, 18.3.2.7 Generic Hardware Error
    Source, "Some platforms may describe multiple Generic Hardware Error
    Source structures with different notification types, ...").
    
    Another approach to use the mci's device refcount (get_device()) and
    have a release function does not work here. A release function will be
    called only for device_release() with the last put_device() call. The
    device must be deleted *before* that with device_del(). This is only
    possible by maintaining an own refcount.

    watchdog: aspeed: Fix clock behaviour for ast2600
    
    [ Upstream commit c04571251b3d842096f1597f5d4badb508be016d ]
    
    The ast2600 no longer uses bit 4 in the control register to indicate a
    1MHz clock (It now controls whether this watchdog is reset by a SOC
    reset). This means we do not want to set it. It also does not need to be
    set for the ast2500, as it is read-only on that SoC.
    
    The comment next to the clock rate selection wandered away from where it
    was set, so put it back next to the register setting it's describing.

    binder: Handle start==NULL in binder_update_page_range()
    
    commit 2a9edd056ed4fbf9d2e797c3fc06335af35bccc4 upstream.
    
    The old loop wouldn't stop when reaching `start` if `start==NULL`, instead
    continuing backwards to index -1 and crashing.
    
    Luckily you need to be highly privileged to map things at NULL, so it's not
    a big problem.
    
    Fix it by adjusting the loop so that the loop variable is always in bounds.
    
    This patch is deliberately minimal to simplify backporting, but IMO this
    function could use a refactor. The jump labels in the second loop body are
    horrible (the error gotos should be jumping to free_range instead), and
    both loops would look nicer if they just iterated upwards through indices.
    And the up_read()+mmput() shouldn't be duplicated like that.

    binder: Prevent repeated use of ->mmap() via NULL mapping
    
    commit a7a74d7ff55a0c657bc46238b050460b9eacea95 upstream.
    
    binder_alloc_mmap_handler() attempts to detect the use of ->mmap() on a
    binder_proc whose binder_alloc has already been initialized by checking
    whether alloc->buffer is non-zero.
    
    Before commit 880211667b20 ("binder: remove kernel vm_area for buffer
    space"), alloc->buffer was a kernel mapping address, which is always
    non-zero, but since that commit, it is a userspace mapping address.
    
    A sufficiently privileged user can map /dev/binder at NULL, tricking
    binder_alloc_mmap_handler() into assuming that the binder_proc has not been
    mapped yet. This leads to memory unsafety.
    Luckily, no context on Android has such privileges, and on a typical Linux
    desktop system, you need to be root to do that.
    
    Fix it by using the mapping size instead of the mapping address to
    distinguish the mapped case. A valid VMA can't have size zero.

    binder: Fix race between mmap() and binder_alloc_print_pages()
    
    commit 8eb52a1ee37aafd9b796713aa0b3ab9cbc455be3 upstream.
    
    binder_alloc_print_pages() iterates over
    alloc->pages[0..alloc->buffer_size-1] under alloc->mutex.
    binder_alloc_mmap_handler() writes alloc->pages and alloc->buffer_size
    without holding that lock, and even writes them before the last bailout
    point.
    
    Unfortunately we can't take the alloc->mutex in the ->mmap() handler
    because mmap_sem can be taken while alloc->mutex is held.
    So instead, we have to locklessly check whether the binder_alloc has been
    fully initialized with binder_alloc_get_vma(), like in
    binder_alloc_new_buf_locked().

    The commit fdc2de87124f ("serial/8250: Add support for NI-Serial
    PXI/PXIe+485 devices") introduced a breakage on NI-Serial PXI(e)-RS485
    devices, RS-232 variants have no issue. The Linux system can enumerate the
    NI-Serial PXI(e)-RS485 devices, but it broke the R/W operation on the
    ports.
    
    However, the implementation is working on the NI internal Linux RT kernel
    but it does not work in the Linux main tree kernel. This is only affecting
    NI products, specifically the RS-485 variants. Reverting the upstream
    until a proper implementation that can apply to both NI internal Linux

    thermal: Fix deadlock in thermal thermal_zone_device_check
    
    commit 163b00cde7cf2206e248789d2780121ad5e6a70b upstream.
    
    1851799e1d29 ("thermal: Fix use-after-free when unregistering thermal zone
    device") changed cancel_delayed_work to cancel_delayed_work_sync to avoid
    a use-after-free issue. However, cancel_delayed_work_sync could be called
    insides the WQ causing deadlock.

    iomap: Fix pipe page leakage during splicing
    
    commit 419e9c38aa075ed0cd3c13d47e15954b686bcdb6 upstream.
    
    When splicing using iomap_dio_rw() to a pipe, we may leak pipe pages
    because bio_iov_iter_get_pages() records that the pipe will have full
    extent worth of data however if file size is not block size aligned
    iomap_dio_rw() returns less than what bio_iov_iter_get_pages() set up
    and splice code gets confused leaking a pipe page with the file tail.
    
    Handle the situation similarly to the old direct IO implementation and
    revert iter to actually returned read amount which makes iter consistent
    with value returned from iomap_dio_rw() and thus the splice code is
    happy.

    bdev: Refresh bdev size for disks without partitioning
    
    commit cba22d86e0a10b7070d2e6a7379dbea51aa0883c upstream.
    
    Currently, block device size in not updated on second and further open
    for block devices where partition scan is disabled. This is particularly
    annoying for example for DVD drives as that means block device size does
    not get updated once the media is inserted into a drive if the device is
    already open when inserting the media. This is actually always the case
    for example when pktcdvd is in use.
    
    Fix the problem by revalidating block device size on every open even for
    devices with partition scan disabled.

    rfkill: allocate static minor
    
    commit 8670b2b8b029a6650d133486be9d2ace146fd29a upstream.
    
    udev has a feature of creating /dev/<node> device-nodes if it finds
    a devnode:<node> modalias. This allows for auto-loading of modules that
    provide the node. This requires to use a statically allocated minor
    number for misc character devices.
    
    However, rfkill uses dynamic minor numbers and prevents auto-loading
    of the module. So allocate the next static misc minor number and use
    it for rfkill.

    commit 3e5ec1db8bfee845d9f8560d1c64aeaccd586398 upstream.
    
    When improving the CS GPIO support at core level, the SPI_CS_HIGH
    has been enabled for all the CS lines used for a given SPI controller.
    
    However, the SPI framework allows to have on the same controller native
    CS and GPIO CS. The native CS may not support the SPI_CS_HIGH, so they
    should not be setup automatically.
    
    With this patch the setting is done only for the CS that will use a
    GPIO as CS

    spi: atmel: Fix CS high support
    
    commit 7cbb16b2122c09f2ae393a1542fed628505b9da6 upstream.
    
    Until a few years ago, this driver was only used with CS GPIO. The
    only exception is CS0 on AT91RM9200 which has to use internal CS. A
    limitation of the internal CS is that they don't support CS High.
    
    So by using the CS GPIO the CS high configuration was available except
    for the particular case CS0 on RM9200.
    
    When the support for the internal chip-select was added, the check of
    the CS high support was not updated. Due to this the driver accepts
    this configuration for all the SPI controller v2 (used by all SoCs
    excepting the AT91RM9200) whereas the hardware doesn't support it for
    infernal CS.
    
    This patch fixes the test to match the hardware capabilities.

    spi: spi-fsl-qspi: Clear TDH bits in FLSHCR register
    
    commit f6910679e17ad4915f008bd2c614d38052426f7c upstream.
    
    Later versions of the QSPI controller (e.g. in i.MX6UL/ULL and i.MX7)
    seem to have an additional TDH setting in the FLSHCR register, that
    needs to be set in accordance with the access mode that is used (DDR
    or SDR).
    
    Previous bootstages such as BootROM or bootloader might have used the
    DDR mode to access the flash. As we currently only use SDR mode, we
    need to make sure the TDH bits are cleared upon initialization.

    crypto: ecdh - fix big endian bug in ECC library
    
    commit f398243e9fd6a3a059c1ea7b380c40628dbf0c61 upstream.
    
    The elliptic curve arithmetic library used by the EC-DH KPP implementation
    assumes big endian byte order, and unconditionally reverses the byte
    and word order of multi-limb quantities. On big endian systems, the byte
    reordering is not necessary, while the word ordering needs to be retained.
    
    So replace the __swab64() invocation with a call to be64_to_cpu() which
    should do the right thing for both little and big endian builds.

    ccp_tx_submit is passed a dma_async_tx_descriptor which is contained in
    a ccp_dma_desc and adds it to a ccp channel's pending list:
    
            list_del(&desc->entry);
            list_add_tail(&desc->entry, &chan->pending);
    
    The problem is that desc->entry may be uninitialized in the
    async_trigger_callback path where the descriptor was gotten
    from ccp_prep_dma_interrupt which got it from ccp_alloc_dma_desc
    which doesn't initialize the desc->entry list head. So, just

    crypto: geode-aes - switch to skcipher for cbc(aes) fallback
    
    commit 504582e8e40b90b8f8c58783e2d1e4f6a2b71a3a upstream.
    
    Commit 79c65d179a40e145 ("crypto: cbc - Convert to skcipher") updated
    the generic CBC template wrapper from a blkcipher to a skcipher algo,
    to get away from the deprecated blkcipher interface. However, as a side
    effect, drivers that instantiate CBC transforms using the blkcipher as
    a fallback no longer work, since skciphers can wrap blkciphers but not
    the other way around. This broke the geode-aes driver.
    
    So let's fix it by moving to the sync skcipher interface when allocating
    the fallback. At the same time, align with the generic API for ECB and
    CBC by rejecting inputs that are not a multiple of the AES block size.

    crypto: af_alg - cast ki_complete ternary op to int
    
    commit 64e7f852c47ce99f6c324c46d6a299a5a7ebead9 upstream.
    
    when libkcapi test is executed  using HW accelerator, cipher operation
    return -74.Since af_alg_async_cb->ki_complete treat err as unsigned int,
    libkcapi receive 429467222 even though it expect -ve value.
    
    Hence its required to cast resultlen to int so that proper
    error is returned to libkcapi.

    crypto: atmel-aes - Fix IV handling when req->nbytes < ivsize
    
    commit 86ef1dfcb561473fbf5e199d58d18c55554d78be upstream.
    
    commit 394a9e044702 ("crypto: cfb - add missing 'chunksize' property")
    adds a test vector where the input length is smaller than the IV length
    (the second test vector). This revealed a NULL pointer dereference in
    the atmel-aes driver, that is caused by passing an incorrect offset in
    scatterwalk_map_and_copy() when atmel_aes_complete() is called.
    
    Do not save the IV in req->info of ablkcipher_request (or equivalently
    req->iv of skcipher_request) when req->nbytes < ivsize, because the IV
    will not be further used.
    
    While touching the code, modify the type of ivsize from int to
    unsigned int, to comply with the return type of
    crypto_ablkcipher_ivsize().

    KVM: x86: Grab KVM's srcu lock when setting nested state
    
    commit ad5996d9a0e8019c3ae5151e687939369acfe044 upstream.
    
    Acquire kvm->srcu for the duration of ->set_nested_state() to fix a bug
    where nVMX derefences ->memslots without holding ->srcu or ->slots_lock.
    
    The other half of nested migration, ->get_nested_state(), does not need
    to acquire ->srcu as it is a purely a dump of internal KVM (and CPU)
    state to userspace.
    
    Detected as an RCU lockdep splat that is 100% reproducible by running
    KVM's state_test selftest with CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=y.  Note that the
    failing function, kvm_is_visible_gfn(), is only checking the validity of
    a gfn, it's not actually accessing guest memory (which is more or less
    unsupported during vmx_set_nested_state() due to incorrect MMU state),
    i.e. vmx_set_nested_state() itself isn't fundamentally broken.  In any
    case, setting nested state isn't a fast path so there's no reason to go
    out of our way to avoid taking ->srcu.

    KVM: x86: do not modify masked bits of shared MSRs
    
    commit de1fca5d6e0105c9d33924e1247e2f386efc3ece upstream.
    
    "Shared MSRs" are guest MSRs that are written to the host MSRs but
    keep their value until the next return to userspace.  They support
    a mask, so that some bits keep the host value, but this mask is
    only used to skip an unnecessary MSR write and the value written
    to the MSR is always the guest MSR.
    
    Fix this and, while at it, do not update smsr->values[slot].curr if
    for whatever reason the wrmsr fails.  This should only happen due to
    reserved bits, so the value written to smsr->values[slot].curr
    will not match when the user-return notifier and the host value will
    always be restored.  However, it is untidy and in rare cases this
    can actually avoid spurious WRMSRs on return to userspace.

    It's possible that two LPIs locate in the same "byte_offset" but target
    two different vcpus, where their pending status are indicated by two
    different pending tables.  In such a scenario, using last_byte_offset
    optimization will lead KVM relying on the wrong pending table entry.
    Let us use last_ptr instead, which can be treated as a byte index into
    a pending table and also, can be vcpu specific.

    KVM: nVMX: Always write vmcs02.GUEST_CR3 during nested VM-Enter
    
    commit 04f11ef45810da5ae2542dd78cc353f3761bd2cb upstream.
    
    Write the desired L2 CR3 into vmcs02.GUEST_CR3 during nested VM-Enter
    instead of deferring the VMWRITE until vmx_set_cr3().  If the VMWRITE
    is deferred, then KVM can consume a stale vmcs02.GUEST_CR3 when it
    refreshes vmcs12->guest_cr3 during nested_vmx_vmexit() if the emulated
    VM-Exit occurs without actually entering L2, e.g. if the nested run
    is squashed because nested VM-Enter (from L1) is putting L2 into HLT.
    
    Note, the above scenario can occur regardless of whether L1 is
    intercepting HLT, e.g. L1 can intercept HLT and then re-enter L2 with
    vmcs.GUEST_ACTIVITY_STATE=HALTED.  But practically speaking, a VMM will
    likely put a guest into HALTED if and only if it's not intercepting HLT.
    
    In an ideal world where EPT *requires* unrestricted guest (and vice
    versa), VMX could handle CR3 similar to how it handles RSP and RIP,
    e.g. mark CR3 dirty and conditionally load it at vmx_vcpu_run().  But
    the unrestricted guest silliness complicates the dirty tracking logic
    to the point that explicitly handling vmcs02.GUEST_CR3 during nested
    VM-Enter is a simpler overall implementation.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Set kvm->arch.xive when VPs are allocated
    
    commit e7d71c943040c23f2fd042033d319f56e84f845b upstream.
    
    If we cannot allocate the XIVE VPs in OPAL, the creation of a XIVE or
    XICS-on-XIVE device is aborted as expected, but we leave kvm->arch.xive
    set forever since the release method isn't called in this case. Any
    subsequent tentative to create a XIVE or XICS-on-XIVE for this VM will
    thus always fail (DoS). This is a problem for QEMU since it destroys
    and re-creates these devices when the VM is reset: the VM would be
    restricted to using the much slower emulated XIVE or XICS forever.
    
    As an alternative to adding rollback, do not assign kvm->arch.xive before
    making sure the XIVE VPs are allocated in OPAL.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Free previous EQ page when setting up a new one
    
    commit 31a88c82b466d2f31a44e21c479f45b4732ccfd0 upstream.
    
    The EQ page is allocated by the guest and then passed to the hypervisor
    with the H_INT_SET_QUEUE_CONFIG hcall. A reference is taken on the page
    before handing it over to the HW. This reference is dropped either when
    the guest issues the H_INT_RESET hcall or when the KVM device is released.
    But, the guest can legitimately call H_INT_SET_QUEUE_CONFIG several times,
    either to reset the EQ (vCPU hot unplug) or to set a new EQ (guest reboot).
    In both cases the existing EQ page reference is leaked because we simply
    overwrite it in the XIVE queue structure without calling put_page().
    
    This is especially visible when the guest memory is backed with huge pages:
    start a VM up to the guest userspace, either reboot it or unplug a vCPU,
    quit QEMU. The leak is observed by comparing the value of HugePages_Free in
    /proc/meminfo before and after the VM is run.
    
    Ideally we'd want the XIVE code to handle the EQ page de-allocation at the
    platform level. This isn't the case right now because the various XIVE
    drivers have different allocation needs. It could maybe worth introducing
    hooks for this purpose instead of exposing XIVE internals to the drivers,
    but this is certainly a huge work to be done later.
    
    In the meantime, for easier backport, fix both vCPU unplug and guest reboot
    leaks by introducing a wrapper around xive_native_configure_queue() that
    does the necessary cleanup.

    mapping for soc node") changed the address and size cells in root node from
    2 to 1, but /memory nodes for the affected boards were not updated. This
    went unnoticed on Exynos5433-based TM2(e) boards, because they use u-boot,
    which updates /memory node to the correct values. On the other hand, the
    mentioned commit broke boot on Exynos7-based Espresso board, which
    bootloader doesn't touch /memory node at all.
    
    This patch reverts commit ef72171b3621 ("arm64: dts: exynos: Remove
    unneeded address space mapping for soc node"), so Exynos5433 and Exynos7
    SoCs again matches other ARM64 platforms with 64bit mappings in root
    node.

    arm64: Validate tagged addresses in access_ok() called from kernel threads
    
    commit df325e05a682e9c624f471835c35bd3f870d5e8c upstream.
    
    __range_ok(), invoked from access_ok(), clears the tag of the user
    address only if CONFIG_ARM64_TAGGED_ADDR_ABI is enabled and the thread
    opted in to the relaxed ABI. The latter sets the TIF_TAGGED_ADDR thread
    flag. In the case of asynchronous I/O (e.g. io_submit()), the
    access_ok() may be called from a kernel thread. Since kernel threads
    don't have TIF_TAGGED_ADDR set, access_ok() will fail for valid tagged
    user addresses. Example from the ffs_user_copy_worker() thread:
    
            use_mm(io_data->mm);
            ret = ffs_copy_to_iter(io_data->buf, ret, &io_data->data);
            unuse_mm(io_data->mm);
    
    Relax the __range_ok() check to always untag the user address if called
    in the context of a kernel thread. The user pointers would have already
    been checked via aio_setup_rw() -> import_{single_range,iovec}() at the
    time of the asynchronous I/O request.

    drm: damage_helper: Fix race checking plane->state->fb
    
    commit 354c2d310082d1c384213ba76c3757dd3cd8755d upstream.
    
    Since the dirtyfb ioctl doesn't give us any hints as to which plane is
    scanning out the fb it's marking as damaged, we need to loop through
    planes to find it.
    
    Currently we just reach into plane state and check, but that can race
    with another commit changing the fb out from under us. This patch locks
    the plane before checking the fb and will release the lock if the plane
    is not displaying the dirty fb.

    commit e23f568aa63f64cd6b355094224cc9356c0f696b upstream.
    
    When the 32bit ino wraps around, kernfs increments the generation
    number to distinguish reused ino instances.  The wrap-around detection
    tests whether the allocated ino is lower than what the cursor but the
    cursor is pointing to the next ino to allocate so the condition never
    triggers.
    
    Fix it by remembering the last ino and comparing against that.

    CIFS: Fix SMB2 oplock break processing
    
    commit fa9c2362497fbd64788063288dc4e74daf977ebb upstream.
    
    Even when mounting modern protocol version the server may be
    configured without supporting SMB2.1 leases and the client
    uses SMB2 oplock to optimize IO performance through local caching.
    
    However there is a problem in oplock break handling that leads
    to missing a break notification on the client who has a file
    opened. It latter causes big latencies to other clients that
    are trying to open the same file.
    
    The problem reproduces when there are multiple shares from the
    same server mounted on the client. The processing code tries to
    match persistent and volatile file ids from the break notification
    with an open file but it skips all share besides the first one.
    Fix this by looking up in all shares belonging to the server that
    issued the oplock break.

    CIFS: Fix NULL-pointer dereference in smb2_push_mandatory_locks
    
    commit 6f582b273ec23332074d970a7fb25bef835df71f upstream.
    
    Currently when the client creates a cifsFileInfo structure for
    a newly opened file, it allocates a list of byte-range locks
    with a pointer to the new cfile and attaches this list to the
    inode's lock list. The latter happens before initializing all
    other fields, e.g. cfile->tlink. Thus a partially initialized
    cifsFileInfo structure becomes available to other threads that
    walk through the inode's lock list. One example of such a thread
    may be an oplock break worker thread that tries to push all
    cached byte-range locks. This causes NULL-pointer dereference
    in smb2_push_mandatory_locks() when accessing cfile->tlink:

    x86/PCI: Avoid AMD FCH XHCI USB PME# from D0 defect
    
    commit 7e8ce0e2b036dbc6617184317983aea4f2c52099 upstream.
    
    The AMD FCH USB XHCI Controller advertises support for generating PME#
    while in D0.  When in D0, it does signal PME# for USB 3.0 connect events,

    x86/mm/32: Sync only to VMALLOC_END in vmalloc_sync_all()
    
    commit 9a62d20027da3164a22244d9f022c0c987261687 upstream.
    
    The job of vmalloc_sync_all() is to help the lazy freeing of vmalloc()
    ranges: before such vmap ranges are reused we make sure that they are
    unmapped from every task's page tables.
    
    This is really easy on pagetable setups where the kernel page tables
    are shared between all tasks - this is the case on 32-bit kernels
    with SHARED_KERNEL_PMD = 1.
    
    But on !SHARED_KERNEL_PMD 32-bit kernels this involves iterating
    over the pgd_list and clearing all pmd entries in the pgds that
    are cleared in the init_mm.pgd, which is the reference pagetable
    that the vmalloc() code uses.
    
    In that context the current practice of vmalloc_sync_all() iterating
    until FIX_ADDR_TOP is buggy:
    
            for (address = VMALLOC_START & PMD_MASK;
                 address >= TASK_SIZE_MAX && address < FIXADDR_TOP;
                 address += PMD_SIZE) {
                    struct page *page;
    
    Because iterating up to FIXADDR_TOP will involve a lot of non-vmalloc
    address ranges:
    
            VMALLOC -> PKMAP -> LDT -> CPU_ENTRY_AREA -> FIX_ADDR
    
    This is mostly harmless for the FIX_ADDR and CPU_ENTRY_AREA ranges
    that don't clear their pmds, but it's lethal for the LDT range,
    which relies on having different mappings in different processes,
    and 'synchronizing' them in the vmalloc sense corrupts those
    pagetable entries (clearing them).
    
    This got particularly prominent with PTI, which turns SHARED_KERNEL_PMD
    off and makes this the dominant mapping mode on 32-bit.
    
    To make LDT working again vmalloc_sync_all() must only iterate over
    the volatile parts of the kernel address range that are identical
    between all processes.
    
    So the correct check in vmalloc_sync_all() is "address < VMALLOC_END"
    to make sure the VMALLOC areas are synchronized and the LDT
    mapping is not falsely overwritten.
    
    The CPU_ENTRY_AREA and the FIXMAP area are no longer synced either,
    but this is not really a proplem since their PMDs get established
    during bootup and never change.
    
    This change fixes the ldt_gdt selftest in my setup.
    
    [ mingo: Fixed up the changelog to explain the logic and modified the
             copying to only happen up until VMALLOC_END. ]

    A number of issues are fixed relating to sysfs input validation:-
    
    1) bb_ctrl_store() - incorrect compare of bit select field to absolute
    value. Reworked per ETMv4 specification.
    2) seq_event_store() - incorrect mask value - register has two
    event values.
    3) cyc_threshold_store() - must mask with max before checking min
    otherwise wrapped values can set illegal value below min.
    4) res_ctrl_store() - update to mask off all res0 bits.

    Input: synaptics-rmi4 - don't increment rmiaddr for SMBus transfers
    
    commit a284e11c371e446371675668d8c8120a27227339 upstream.
    
    This increment of rmi_smbus in rmi_smb_read/write_block() causes
    garbage to be read/written.
    
    The first read of SMB_MAX_COUNT bytes is fine, but after that
    it is nonsense. Trial-and-error showed that by dropping the
    increment of rmiaddr everything is fine and the F54 function
    properly works.
    
    I tried a hack with rmi_smb_write_block() as well (writing to the
    same F54 touchpad data area, then reading it back), and that
    suggests that there too the rmiaddr increment has to be dropped.
    It makes sense that if it has to be dropped for read, then it has
    to be dropped for write as well.
    
    It looks like the initial work with F54 was done using i2c, not smbus,
    and it seems nobody ever tested F54 with smbus. The other functions
    all read/write less than SMB_MAX_COUNT as far as I can tell, so this
    issue was never noticed with non-F54 functions.
    
    With this change I can read out the touchpad data correctly on my
    Lenovo X1 Carbon 6th Gen laptop.

    commit 86bcd3a12999447faad60ec59c2d64d18d8e61ac upstream.
    
    F34 is a bit special as it reinitializes the device and related driver
    structs during the firmware update. This clears the fn_irq_mask which
    will then prevent F34 from receiving further interrupts, leading to
    timeouts during the firmware update. Make sure to reinitialize the
    IRQ enables at the appropriate times.
    
    The issue is in F34 code, but the commit in the fixes tag exposed the
    issue, as before this commit things would work by accident.

    ALSA: hda: Modify stream stripe mask only when needed
    
    commit e38e486d66e2a3b902768fd71c32dbf10f77e1cb upstream.
    
    The recent commit in HD-audio stream management for changing the
    stripe control seems causing a regression on some platforms.  The
    stripe control is currently used only by HDMI codec, and applying the
    stripe mask unconditionally may lead to scratchy and static noises as
    seen on some MacBooks.

    management code to apply the stripe mask conditionally only when the
    codec driver requested.

    commit 4cc8d6505ab82db3357613d36e6c58a297f57f7c upstream.
    
    syzkaller reported an invalid access in PCM OSS read, and this seems
    to be an overflow of the internal buffer allocated for a plugin.
    Since the rate plugin adjusts its transfer size dynamically, the
    calculation for the chained plugin might be bigger than the given
    buffer size in some extreme cases, which lead to such an buffer
    overflow as caught by KASAN.
    
    Fix it by limiting the max transfer size properly by checking against
    the destination size in each plugin transfer callback.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix inverted bass GPIO pin on Acer 8951G
    
    commit 336820c4374bc065317f247dc2bb37c0e41b64a6 upstream.
    
    We've added the bass speaker support on Acer 8951G by the commit
    00066e9733f6 ("Add Acer Aspire Ethos 8951G model quirk"), but it seems
    that the GPIO pin was wrongly set: while the commit turns off the bit
    to power up the amp, the actual hardware reacts other way round,
    i.e. GPIO bit on = amp on.
    
    So this patch fixes the bug, turning on the GPIO bit 0x02 as default.
    Since turning on the GPIO bit can be more easily managed with
    alc_setup_gpio() call, we simplify the quirk code by integrating the
    GPIO setup into the existing alc662_fixup_aspire_ethos_hp() and
    dropping the whole ALC669_FIXUP_ACER_ASPIRE_ETHOS_SUBWOOFER quirk.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Enable internal speaker of ASUS UX431FLC
    
    commit 436e25505f3458cc92c7f3c985e9cbc198a98209 upstream.
    
    Laptops like ASUS UX431FLC and UX431FL can share the same audio quirks.
    But UX431FLC needs one more step to enable the internal speaker: Pull
    the GPIO from CODEC to initialize the AMP.

    SUNRPC: Avoid RPC delays when exiting suspend
    
    commit 66eb3add452aa1be65ad536da99fac4b8f620b74 upstream.
    
    Jon Hunter: "I have been tracking down another suspend/NFS related
    issue where again I am seeing random delays exiting suspend. The delays
    can be up to a couple minutes in the worst case and this is causing a
    suspend test we have to fail."
    
    Change the use of a deferrable work to a standard delayed one.

    io_uring: ensure req->submit is copied when req is deferred
    
    There's an issue with deferred requests through drain, where if we do
    need to defer, we're not copying over the sqe_submit state correctly.
    This can result in using uninitialized data when we then later go and
    submit the deferred request, like this check in __io_submit_sqe():
    
             if (unlikely(s->index >= ctx->sq_entries))
                     return -EINVAL;
    
    with 's' being uninitialized, we can randomly fail this check. Fix this
    by copying sqe_submit state when we defer a request.
    
    Because it was fixed as part of a cleanup series in mainline, before
    anyone realized we had this issue. That removed the separate states
    of ->index vs ->submit.sqe. That series is not something I was
    comfortable putting into stable, hence the much simpler addition.
    Here's the patch in the series that fixes the same issue:

    fuse: fix leak of fuse_io_priv
    
    commit f1ebdeffc6f325e30e0ddb9f7a70f1370fa4b851 upstream.
    
    exit_aio() is sometimes stuck in wait_for_completion() after aio is issued
    with direct IO and the task receives a signal.
    
    The reason is failure to call ->ki_complete() due to a leaked reference to
    fuse_io_priv.  This happens in fuse_async_req_send() if
    fuse_simple_background() returns an error (e.g. -EINTR).
    
    In this case the error value is propagated via io->err, so return success
    to not confuse callers.
    
    This issue is tracked as a virtio-fs issue:

    mwifiex: Re-work support for SDIO HW reset
    
    commit cdb2256f795e8e78cc43f32d091695b127dfb4df upstream.
    
    The SDIO HW reset procedure in mwifiex_sdio_card_reset_work() is broken,
    when the SDIO card is shared with another SDIO func driver. This is the
    case when the Bluetooth btmrvl driver is being used in combination with
    mwifiex. More precisely, when mwifiex_sdio_card_reset_work() runs to resets
    the SDIO card, the btmrvl driver doesn't get notified about it. Beyond that
    point, the btmrvl driver will fail to communicate with the SDIO card.
    
    This is a generic problem for SDIO func drivers sharing an SDIO card, which
    are about to be addressed in subsequent changes to the mmc core and the
    mmc_hw_reset() interface. In principle, these changes means the
    mmc_hw_reset() interface starts to return 1 if the are multiple drivers for
    the SDIO card, as to indicate to the caller that the reset needed to be
    scheduled asynchronously through a hotplug mechanism of the SDIO card.
    
    Let's prepare the mwifiex driver to support the upcoming new behaviour of
    mmc_hw_reset(), which means extending the mwifiex_sdio_card_reset_work() to
    support the asynchronous SDIO HW reset path. This also means, we need to
    allow the ->remove() callback to run, without waiting for the FW to be
    loaded. Additionally, during system suspend, mwifiex_sdio_suspend() may be
    called when a reset has been scheduled, but waiting to be executed. In this
    scenario let's simply return -EBUSY to abort the suspend process, as to
    allow the reset to be completed first.

    serial: pl011: Fix DMA ->flush_buffer()
    
    commit f6a196477184b99a31d16366a8e826558aa11f6d upstream.
    
    PL011's ->flush_buffer() implementation releases and reacquires the port
    lock.  Due to a race condition here, data can end up being added to the
    circular buffer but neither being discarded nor being sent out.  This
    leads to, for example, tcdrain(2) waiting indefinitely.
    
    Process A                       Process B
    
    uart_flush_buffer()
     - acquire lock
     - circ_clear
     - pl011_flush_buffer()
     -- release lock
     -- dmaengine_terminate_all()
    
                                    uart_write()
                                    - acquire lock
                                    - add chars to circ buffer
                                    - start_tx()
                                    -- start DMA
                                    - release lock
    
     -- acquire lock
     -- turn off DMA
     -- release lock
    
                                    // Data in circ buffer but DMA is off
    
    According to the comment in the code, the releasing of the lock around
    dmaengine_terminate_all() is to avoid a deadlock with the DMA engine
    callback.  However, since the time this code was written, the DMA engine
    API documentation seems to have been clarified to say that
    dmaengine_terminate_all() (in the identically implemented but
    differently named dmaengine_terminate_async() variant) does not wait for
    any running complete callback to be completed and can even be called
    from a complete callback.  So there is no possibility of deadlock if the
    DMA engine driver implements this API correctly.
    
    So we should be able to just remove this release and reacquire of the
    lock to prevent the aforementioned race condition.

    tty: serial: msm_serial: Fix flow control
    
    commit b027ce258369cbfa88401a691c23dad01deb9f9b upstream.
    
    hci_qca interfaces to the wcn3990 via a uart_dm on the msm8998 mtp and
    Lenovo Miix 630 laptop.  As part of initializing the wcn3990, hci_qca
    disables flow, configures the uart baudrate, and then reenables flow - at
    which point an event is expected to be received over the uart from the
    wcn3990.  It is observed that this event comes after the baudrate change
    but before hci_qca re-enables flow. This is unexpected, and is a result of
    msm_reset() being broken.
    
    According to the uart_dm hardware documentation, it is recommended that
    automatic hardware flow control be enabled by setting RX_RDY_CTL.  Auto
    hw flow control will manage RFR based on the configured watermark.  When
    there is space to receive data, the hw will assert RFR.  When the watermark
    is hit, the hw will de-assert RFR.
    
    The hardware documentation indicates that RFR can me manually managed via
    CR when RX_RDY_CTL is not set.  SET_RFR asserts RFR, and RESET_RFR
    de-asserts RFR.
    
    msm_reset() is broken because after resetting the hardware, it
    unconditionally asserts RFR via SET_RFR.  This enables flow regardless of
    the current configuration, and would undo a previous flow disable
    operation.  It should instead de-assert RFR via RESET_RFR to block flow
    until the hardware is reconfigured.  msm_serial should rely on the client
    to specify that flow should be enabled, either via mctrl() or the termios
    structure, and only assert RFR in response to those triggers.

    The dmaengine_prep_slave_sg needs to use sg count returned

    serial: 8250-mtk: Use platform_get_irq_optional() for optional irq
    
    commit eb9c1a41ea1234907615fe47d6e47db8352d744b upstream.
    
    As platform_get_irq() now prints an error when the interrupt does not
    exist, this warnings are printed on bananapi-r2:

    staging/octeon: Use stubs for MIPS && !CAVIUM_OCTEON_SOC
    
    commit 17a29fea086ba18b000d28439bd5cb4f2b0a527b upstream.
    
    When building for a non-Cavium MIPS system with COMPILE_TEST=y, the
    Octeon ethernet driver hits a number of issues due to use of macros
    provided only for CONFIG_CAVIUM_OCTEON_SOC=y configurations. For
    example:
    
      drivers/staging/octeon/ethernet-rx.c:190:6: error:
        'CONFIG_CAVIUM_OCTEON_CVMSEG_SIZE' undeclared (first use in this function)
      drivers/staging/octeon/ethernet-rx.c:472:25: error:
        'OCTEON_IRQ_WORKQ0' undeclared (first use in this function)
    
    These come from various asm/ headers that a non-Octeon build will be
    using a non-Octeon version of.
    
    Fix this by using the octeon-stubs.h header for non-Cavium MIPS builds,
    and only using the real asm/octeon/ headers when building a Cavium
    Octeon kernel configuration.
    
    This requires that octeon-stubs.h doesn't redefine XKPHYS_TO_PHYS, which
    is defined for MIPS by asm/addrspace.h which is pulled in by many other
    common asm/ headers.

    mailbox: tegra: Fix superfluous IRQ error message
    
    commit c745da8d4320c49e54662c0a8f7cb6b8204f44c4 upstream.
    
    Commit 7723f4c5ecdb ("driver core: platform: Add an error message to
    platform_get_irq*()") added an error message to avoid drivers having
    to print an error message when IRQ lookup fails. However, there are
    some cases where IRQs are optional and so new optional versions of
    the platform_get_irq*() APIs have been added for these cases.
    
    The IRQs for Tegra HSP module are optional because not all instances
    of the module have the doorbell and all of the shared interrupts.
    Hence, since the above commit was applied the following error messages
    are now seen on Tegra194 ...
    
     ERR KERN tegra-hsp c150000.hsp: IRQ doorbell not found
     ERR KERN tegra-hsp c150000.hsp: IRQ shared0 not found
    
    The Tegra HSP driver deliberately does not fail if these are not found
    and so fix the above errors by updating the Tegra HSP driver to use
    the platform_get_irq_byname_optional() API.

    time: Zero the upper 32-bits in __kernel_timespec on 32-bit
    
    commit 7b8474466ed97be458c825f34a85f2c2b84c3f95 upstream.
    
    On compat interfaces, the high order bits of nanoseconds should be zeroed
    out. This is because the application code or the libc do not guarantee
    zeroing of these. If used without zeroing, kernel might be at risk of using
    timespec values incorrectly.
    
    Originally it was handled correctly, but lost during is_compat_syscall()
    cleanup. Revert the condition back to check CONFIG_64BIT.

    lp: fix sparc64 LPSETTIMEOUT ioctl
    
    commit 45a2d64696b11913bcf1087b041740edbade3e21 upstream.
    
    The layout of struct timeval is different on sparc64 from
    anything else, and the patch I did long ago failed to take
    this into account.
    
    Change it now to handle sparc64 user space correctly again.
    
    Quite likely nobody cares about parallel ports on sparc64,
    but there is no reason not to fix it.

    sparc64: implement ioremap_uc
    
    commit 38e45d81d14e5f78cd67922596b1c37b4c22ec74 upstream.
    
    On sparc64, the whole physical IO address space is accessible using
    physically addressed loads and stores. *_uc does nothing like the
    others.

    arm64: tegra: Fix 'active-low' warning for Jetson Xavier regulator
    
    commit d440538e5f219900a9fc9d96fd10727b4d2b3c48 upstream.
    
    Commit 4fdbfd60a3a2 ("arm64: tegra: Add PCIe slot supply information
    in p2972-0000 platform") added regulators for the PCIe slot on the
    Jetson Xavier platform. One of these regulators has an active-low enable
    and this commit incorrectly added an active-low specifier for the GPIO
    which causes the following warning to occur on boot ...
    
     WARNING KERN regulator@3 GPIO handle specifies active low - ignored
    
    The fixed-regulator binding does not use the active-low flag from the
    gpio specifier and purely relies of the presence of the
    'enable-active-high' property to determine if it is active high or low
    (if this property is omitted). Fix this warning by setting the GPIO
    to active-high in the GPIO specifier. Finally, remove the
    'enable-active-low' as this is not a valid property.

    arm64: tegra: Fix 'active-low' warning for Jetson TX1 regulator
    
    commit 1e5e929c009559bd7e898ac8e17a5d01037cb057 upstream.
    
    Commit 34993594181d ("arm64: tegra: Enable HDMI on Jetson TX1")
    added a regulator for HDMI on the Jetson TX1 platform. This regulator
    has an active high enable, but the GPIO specifier for enabling the
    regulator incorrectly defines it as active-low. This causes the
    following warning to occur on boot ...
    
     WARNING KERN regulator@10 GPIO handle specifies active low - ignored
    
    The fixed-regulator binding does not use the active-low flag from the
    gpio specifier and purely relies of the presence of the
    'enable-active-high' property to determine if it is active high or low
    (if this property is omitted). Fix this warning by setting the GPIO
    to active-high in the GPIO specifier which aligns with the presense of
    the 'enable-active-high' property.
