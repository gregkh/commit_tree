    perf: Make perf able to build with latest libbfd
    
    commit 0ada120c883d4f1f6aafd01cf0fbb10d8bbba015 upstream.
    
    libbfd has changed the bfd_section_* macros to inline functions
    bfd_section_<field> since 2019-09-18. See below two commits:
      o http://www.sourceware.org/ml/gdb-cvs/2019-09/msg00064.html
      o https://www.sourceware.org/ml/gdb-cvs/2019-09/msg00072.html
    
    This fix make perf able to build with both old and new libbfd.

    Lockdep keys themselves were added in commit ab92d68fc22f ("net: core:
    add generic lockdep keys"), and it's very likely that this splat existed
    since then, but I have no real way to check, since this stacked platform
    wasn't supported by mainline back then.
    
    >From Taehee's own words:
    
      This patch was considered that all stackable devices have LLTX flag.
      But the dsa doesn't have LLTX, so this splat happened.
      After this patch, dsa shares the same lockdep class key.
      On the nested dsa interface architecture, which you illustrated,
      the same lockdep class key will be used in __dev_queue_xmit() because
      dsa doesn't have LLTX.
      So that lockdep detects deadlock because the same lockdep class key is
      used recursively although actually the different locks are used.
      There are some ways to fix this problem.
    
      1. using NETIF_F_LLTX flag.
      If possible, using the LLTX flag is a very clear way for it.
      But I'm so sorry I don't know whether the dsa could have LLTX or not.
    
      2. using dynamic lockdep again.
      It means that each interface uses a separate lockdep class key.
      So, lockdep will not detect recursive locking.
      But this way has a problem that it could consume lockdep class key
      too many.
      Currently, lockdep can have 8192 lockdep class keys.
       - you can see this number with the following command.
         cat /proc/lockdep_stats
         lock-classes:                         1251 [max: 8192]
         ...
         The [max: 8192] means that the maximum number of lockdep class keys.
      If too many lockdep class keys are registered, lockdep stops to work.
      So, using a dynamic(separated) lockdep class key should be considered
      carefully.
      In addition, updating lockdep class key routine might have to be existing.
      (lockdep_register_key(), lockdep_set_class(), lockdep_unregister_key())
    
      3. Using lockdep subclass.
      A lockdep class key could have 8 subclasses.
      The different subclass is considered different locks by lockdep
      infrastructure.
      But "lock-classes" is not counted by subclasses.
      So, it could avoid stopping lockdep infrastructure by an overflow of
      lockdep class keys.
      This approach should also have an updating lockdep class key routine.
      (lockdep_set_subclass())
    
      4. Using nonvalidate lockdep class key.
      The lockdep infrastructure supports nonvalidate lockdep class key type.
      It means this lockdep is not validated by lockdep infrastructure.
      So, the splat will not happen but lockdep couldn't detect real deadlock
      case because lockdep really doesn't validate it.
      I think this should be used for really special cases.
      (lockdep_set_novalidate_class())
    
    Further discussion here:
    https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/patch/20200503052220.4536-2-xiyou.wangcong@gmail.com/
    
    There appears to be no negative side-effect to declaring lockless TX for
    the DSA virtual interfaces, which means they handle their own locking.
    So that's what we do to make the splat go away.
    
    Patch tested in a wide variety of cases: unicast, multicast, PTP, etc.

    Similar to the last path, need to fix fib_info_nh_uses_dev for
    external nexthops to avoid referencing multiple nh_grp structs.
    Move the device check in fib_info_nh_uses_dev to a helper and

    nexthop: Expand nexthop_is_multipath in a few places
    
    commit 0b5e2e39739e861fa5fc84ab27a35dbe62a15330 upstream.
    
    I got too fancy consolidating checks on multipath type. The result
    is that path lookups can access 2 different nh_grp structs as exposed
    by Nik's torture tests. Expand nexthop_is_multipath within nexthop.h to
    avoid multiple, nh_grp dereferences and make decisions based on the
    consistent struct.
    
    Only 2 places left using nexthop_is_multipath are within IPv6, both
    only check that the nexthop is a multipath for a branching decision
    which are acceptable.

    nexthops: don't modify published nexthop groups
    
    commit 90f33bffa382598a32cc82abfeb20adc92d041b6 upstream.
    
    We must avoid modifying published nexthop groups while they might be
    in use, otherwise we might see NULL ptr dereferences. In order to do
    that we allocate 2 nexthoup group structures upon nexthop creation
    and swap between them when we have to delete an entry. The reason is
    that we can't fail nexthop group removal, so we can't handle allocation
    failure thus we move the extra allocation on creation where we can
    safely fail and return ENOMEM.

    xsk: Add overflow check for u64 division, stored into u32
    
    commit b16a87d0aef7a6be766f6618976dc5ff2c689291 upstream.
    
    The npgs member of struct xdp_umem is an u32 entity, and stores the
    number of pages the UMEM consumes. The calculation of npgs
    
      npgs = size / PAGE_SIZE
    
    can overflow.
    
    To avoid overflow scenarios, the division is now first stored in a
    u64, and the result is verified to fit into 32b.
    
    An alternative would be storing the npgs as a u64, however, this
    wastes memory and is an unrealisticly large packet area.

    bnxt_en: Fix accumulation of bp->net_stats_prev.
    
    commit b8056e8434b037fdab08158fea99ed7bc8ef3a74 upstream.
    
    We have logic to maintain network counters across resets by storing
    the counters in bp->net_stats_prev before reset.  But not all resets
    will clear the counters.  Certain resets that don't need to change
    the number of rings do not clear the counters.  The current logic
    accumulates the counters before all resets, causing big jumps in
    the counters after some resets, such as ethtool -G.
    
    Fix it by only accumulating the counters during reset if the irq_re_init
    parameter is set.  The parameter signifies that all rings and interrupts
    will be reset and that means that the counters will also be reset.

    esp6: get the right proto for transport mode in esp6_gso_encap
    
    commit 3c96ec56828922e3fe5477f75eb3fc02f98f98b5 upstream.
    
    For transport mode, when ipv6 nexthdr is set, the packet format might
    be like:
    
        ----------------------------------------------------
        |        | dest |     |     |      |  ESP    | ESP |
        | IP6 hdr| opts.| ESP | TCP | Data | Trailer | ICV |
        ----------------------------------------------------
    
    What it wants to get for x-proto in esp6_gso_encap() is the proto that
    will be set in ESP nexthdr. So it should skip all ipv6 nexthdrs and
    get the real transport protocol. Othersize, the wrong proto number
    will be set into ESP nexthdr.
    
    This patch is to skip all ipv6 nexthdrs by calling ipv6_skip_exthdr()
    in esp6_gso_encap().

    netfilter: conntrack: make conntrack userspace helpers work again
    
    commit ee04805ff54a63ffd90bc6749ebfe73473734ddb upstream.
    
    Florian Westphal says:
    
    "Problem is that after the helper hook was merged back into the confirm
    one, the queueing itself occurs from the confirm hook, i.e. we queue
    from the last netfilter callback in the hook-list.
    
    Therefore, on return, the packet bypasses the confirm action and the
    connection is never committed to the main conntrack table.
    
    To fix this there are several ways:
    1. revert the 'Fixes' commit and have a extra helper hook again.
       Works, but has the drawback of adding another indirect call for
       everyone.
    
    2. Special case this: split the hooks only when userspace helper
       gets added, so queueing occurs at a lower priority again,
       and normal enqueue reinject would eventually call the last hook.
    
    3. Extend the existing nf_queue ct update hook to allow a forced
       confirmation (plus run the seqadj code).
    
    This goes for 3)."

    ip_vti: receive ipip packet by calling ip_tunnel_rcv
    
    commit 976eba8ab596bab94b9714cd46d38d5c6a2c660d upstream.
    
    In Commit dd9ee3444014 ("vti4: Fix a ipip packet processing bug in
    'IPCOMP' virtual tunnel"), it tries to receive IPIP packets in vti
    by calling xfrm_input(). This case happens when a small packet or
    frag sent by peer is too small to get compressed.
    
    However, xfrm_input() will still get to the IPCOMP path where skb
    sec_path is set, but never dropped while it should have been done
    in vti_ipcomp4_protocol.cb_handler(vti_rcv_cb), as it's not an
    ipcomp4 packet. This will cause that the packet can never pass
    xfrm4_policy_check() in the upper protocol rcv functions.
    
    So this patch is to call ip_tunnel_rcv() to process IPIP packets
    instead.

    xfrm_local_error(). Then it will go to xfrm6_local_error() where it tries
    to get ipv6 info from a ipv4 sk.
    
    This issue was actually fixed by Commit 628e341f319f ("xfrm: make local
    error reporting more robust"), but brought back by Commit 844d48746e4b
    ("xfrm: choose protocol family by skb protocol").
    
    So to fix it, we should call xfrm6_local_error() only when skb->protocol
    is htons(ETH_P_IPV6) and skb->sk->sk_family is AF_INET6.

    The issue was introduced by Commit 7cb8a93968e3 ("xfrm: Allow inserting
    policies with matching mark and different priorities"). After that, the
    policies [1] and [2] would be able to be added with different priorities.
    
    However, policy [3] will actually match both [1] and [2]. Policy [1]
    was matched due to the 1st 'return true' in xfrm_policy_mark_match(),
    and policy [2] was matched due to the 2nd 'return true' in there. It
    caused WARN_ON() in xfrm_policy_insert_list().
    
    This patch is to fix it by only (the same value and priority) as the
    same policy in xfrm_policy_mark_match().
    
    Thanks to Yuehaibing, we could make this fix better.
    
    v1->v2:
      - check policy->mark.v == pol->mark.v only without mask.

    The problem is that x-netns xfrm interface are not removed when the link

    As on the tx path of vxlan over esp, skb->inner_network_header would be
    set on vxlan_xmit() and xfrm4_tunnel_encap_add(), and the later one can
    overwrite the former one. It causes skb_udp_tunnel_segment() to use a
    wrong skb->inner_network_header, then the issue occurs.
    
    This patch is to fix it by calling xfrm_output_gso() instead when the
    inner_protocol is set, in which gso_segment of inner_protocol will be
    done first.
    
    While at it, also improve some code around.

    This xfrm_state_put call in esp4/6_gro_receive() will cause
    double put for state, as in out_reset path secpath_reset()
    will put all states set in skb sec_path.

    xfrm: do pskb_pull properly in __xfrm_transport_prep
    
    commit 06a0afcfe2f551ff755849ea2549b0d8409fd9a0 upstream.
    
    For transport mode, when ipv6 nexthdr is set, the packet format might
    be like:
    
        ----------------------------------------------------
        |        | dest |     |     |      |  ESP    | ESP |
        | IP6 hdr| opts.| ESP | TCP | Data | Trailer | ICV |
        ----------------------------------------------------
    
    and in __xfrm_transport_prep():
    
      pskb_pull(skb, skb->mac_len + sizeof(ip6hdr) + x->props.header_len);
    
    it will pull the data pointer to the wrong position, as it missed the
    nexthdrs/dest opts.
    
    This patch is to fix it by using:
    
      pskb_pull(skb, skb_transport_offset(skb) + x->props.header_len);
    
    as we can be sure transport_header points to ESP header at that moment.
    
    It also fixes a panic when packets with ipv6 nexthdr are sent over
    esp6 transport mode:

    xfrm: allow to accept packets with ipv6 NEXTHDR_HOP in xfrm_input
    
    commit afcaf61be9d1dbdee5ec186d1dcc67b6b692180f upstream.
    
    For beet mode, when it's ipv6 inner address with nexthdrs set,
    the packet format might be:
    
        ----------------------------------------------------
        | outer  |     | dest |     |      |  ESP    | ESP |
        | IP hdr | ESP | opts.| TCP | Data | Trailer | ICV |
        ----------------------------------------------------
    
    The nexthdr from ESP could be NEXTHDR_HOP(0), so it should
    continue processing the packet when nexthdr returns 0 in
    xfrm_input(). Otherwise, when ipv6 nexthdr is set, the
    packet will be dropped.
    
    I don't see any error cases that nexthdr may return 0. So
    fix it by removing the check for nexthdr == 0.

    x86/dma: Fix max PFN arithmetic overflow on 32 bit systems
    
    commit 88743470668ef5eb6b7ba9e0f99888e5999bf172 upstream.
    
    The intermediate result of the old term (4UL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024) is
    4 294 967 296 or 0x100000000 which is no problem on 64 bit systems.
    The patch does not change the later overall result of 0x100000 for
    MAX_DMA32_PFN (after it has been shifted by PAGE_SHIFT). The new
    calculation yields the same result, but does not require 64 bit
    arithmetic.
    
    On 32 bit systems the old calculation suffers from an arithmetic
    overflow in that intermediate term in braces: 4UL aka unsigned long int
    is 4 byte wide and an arithmetic overflow happens (the 0x100000000 does
    not fit in 4 bytes), the in braces result is truncated to zero, the
    following right shift does not alter that, so MAX_DMA32_PFN evaluates to
    0 on 32 bit systems.
    
    That wrong value is a problem in a comparision against MAX_DMA32_PFN in
    the init code for swiotlb in pci_swiotlb_detect_4gb() to decide if
    swiotlb should be active.  That comparison yields the opposite result,
    when compiling on 32 bit systems.
    
    This was not possible before
    
      1b7e03ef7570 ("x86, NUMA: Enable emulation on 32bit too")
    
    when that MAX_DMA32_PFN was first made visible to x86_32 (and which
    landed in v3.0).
    
    In practice this wasn't a problem, unless CONFIG_SWIOTLB is active on
    x86-32.
    
    However if one has set CONFIG_IOMMU_INTEL, since
    
      c5a5dc4cbbf4 ("iommu/vt-d: Don't switch off swiotlb if bounce page is used")
    
    there's a dependency on CONFIG_SWIOTLB, which was not necessarily
    active before. That landed in v5.4, where we noticed it in the fli4l
    Linux distribution. We have CONFIG_IOMMU_INTEL active on both 32 and 64
    bit kernel configs there (I could not find out why, so let's just say
    historical reasons).
    
    The effect is at boot time 64 MiB (default size) were allocated for
    bounce buffers now, which is a noticeable amount of memory on small
    systems like pcengines ALIX 2D3 with 256 MiB memory, which are still
    frequently used as home routers.
    
    We noticed this effect when migrating from kernel v4.19 (LTS) to v5.4
    (LTS) in fli4l and got that kernel messages for example:
    
      Linux version 5.4.22 (buildroot@buildroot) (gcc version 7.3.0 (Buildroot 2018.02.8)) #1 SMP Mon Nov 26 23:40:00 CET 2018
      …
      Memory: 183484K/261756K available (4594K kernel code, 393K rwdata, 1660K rodata, 536K init, 456K bss , 78272K reserved, 0K cma-reserved, 0K highmem)
      …
      PCI-DMA: Using software bounce buffering for IO (SWIOTLB)
      software IO TLB: mapped [mem 0x0bb78000-0x0fb78000] (64MB)
    
    The initial analysis and the suggested fix was done by user 'sourcejedi'
    at stackoverflow and explicitly marked as GPLv2 for inclusion in the
    Linux kernel:
    
      https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/520525/50007
    
    The new calculation, which does not suffer from that overflow, is the
    same as for arch/mips now as suggested by Robin Murphy.
    
    The fix was tested by fli4l users on round about two dozen different
    systems, including both 32 and 64 bit archs, bare metal and virtualized
    machines.

    The issue happens due to the following sequence of events:
    
    1) mesh_path_start_discovery():
    -> spin_unlock_bh(&mpath->state_lock) before mesh_path_sel_frame_tx()
    
    2) mesh_path_free_rcu()
    -> del_timer_sync(&mpath->timer)
       [...]
    -> kfree_rcu(mpath)
    
    3) mesh_path_start_discovery():
    -> mod_timer(&mpath->timer, ...)
       [...]
    -> rcu_read_unlock()
    
    4) mesh_path_free_rcu()'s kfree_rcu():
    -> kfree(mpath)
    
    5) mesh_path_timer() starts after timeout, using freed mpath object
    
    So a use-after-free issue due to a timer re-arming bug caused by an
    early spin-unlocking.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by re-checking if mpath is about to be
    free'd and if so bails out of re-arming the timer.

    cfg80211: fix debugfs rename crash
    
    commit 0bbab5f0301587cad4e923ccc49bb910db86162c upstream.
    
    Removing the "if (IS_ERR(dir)) dir = NULL;" check only works
    if we adjust the remaining code to not rely on it being NULL.
    Check IS_ERR_OR_NULL() before attempting to dereference it.
    
    I'm not actually entirely sure this fixes the syzbot crash as
    the kernel config indicates that they do have DEBUG_FS in the
    kernel, but this is what I found when looking there.

    Thus, when kobject_init_and_add() returns an error,

    gpio: fix locking open drain IRQ lines
    
    [ Upstream commit e9bdf7e655b9ee81ee912fae1d59df48ce7311b6 ]
    
    We provided the right semantics on open drain lines being
    by definition output but incidentally the irq set up function
    would only allow IRQs on lines that were "not output".
    
    Fix the semantics to allow output open drain lines to be used
    for IRQs.

    [ Upstream commit b0beb28097fa04177b3769f4bb7a0d0d9c4ae76e ]
    
    This reverts commit c58c1f83436b501d45d4050fd1296d71a9760bcb.
    
    io_uring does do the right thing for this case, and we're still returning
    -EAGAIN to userspace for the cases we don't support. Revert this change
    to avoid doing endless spins of resubmits.

    mm: remove VM_BUG_ON(PageSlab()) from page_mapcount()
    
    [ Upstream commit 6988f31d558aa8c744464a7f6d91d34ada48ad12 ]

    Technically reverts commit 1d148e218a0d ("mm: add VM_BUG_ON_PAGE() to
    page_mapcount()"), but context lines have changed.
    
    Function isolate_migratepages_block() runs some checks out of lru_lock
    when choose pages for migration.  After checking PageLRU() it checks
    extra page references by comparing page_count() and page_mapcount().
    Between these two checks page could be removed from lru, freed and taken
    by slab.
    
    As a result this race triggers VM_BUG_ON(PageSlab()) in page_mapcount().
    Race window is tiny.  For certain workload this happens around once a
    year.

    IB/ipoib: Fix double free of skb in case of multicast traffic in CM mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 1acba6a817852d4aa7916d5c4f2c82f702ee9224 ]
    
    When connected mode is set, and we have connected and datagram traffic in
    parallel, ipoib might crash with double free of datagram skb.
    
    The current mechanism assumes that the order in the completion queue is
    the same as the order of sent packets for all QPs. Order is kept only for
    specific QP, in case of mixed UD and CM traffic we have few QPs (one UD and
    few CM's) in parallel.
    
    The problem:
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    
    Transmit queue:
    -----------------
    UD skb pointer kept in queue itself, CM skb kept in spearate queue and
    uses transmit queue as a placeholder to count the number of total
    transmitted packets.
    
    0   1   2   3   4  5  6  7  8   9  10  11 12 13 .........127
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    NL ud1 UD2 CM1 ud3 cm2 cm3 ud4 cm4 ud5 NL NL NL ...........
    ------------------------------------------------------------
        ^                                  ^
       tail                               head
    
    Completion queue (problematic scenario) - the order not the same as in
    the transmit queue:
    
      1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
    ------------------------------------
     ud1 CM1 UD2 ud3 cm2 cm3 ud4 cm4 ud5
    ------------------------------------
    
    1. CM1 'wc' processing
       - skb freed in cm separate ring.
       - tx_tail of transmit queue increased although UD2 is not freed.
         Now driver assumes UD2 index is already freed and it could be used for
         new transmitted skb.
    
    0   1   2   3   4  5  6  7  8   9  10  11 12 13 .........127
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    NL NL  UD2 CM1 ud3 cm2 cm3 ud4 cm4 ud5 NL NL NL ...........
    ------------------------------------------------------------
            ^   ^                       ^
          (Bad)tail                    head
    (Bad - Could be used for new SKB)
    
    In this case (due to heavy load) UD2 skb pointer could be replaced by new
    transmitted packet UD_NEW, as the driver assumes its free.  At this point
    we will have to process two 'wc' with same index but we have only one
    pointer to free.
    
    During second attempt to free the same skb we will have NULL pointer
    exception.
    
    2. UD2 'wc' processing
       - skb freed according the index we got from 'wc', but it was already
         overwritten by mistake. So actually the skb that was released is the
         skb of the new transmitted packet and not the original one.
    
    3. UD_NEW 'wc' processing
       - attempt to free already freed skb. NUll pointer exception.
    
    The fix:
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The fix is to stop using the UD ring as a placeholder for CM packets, the
    cyclic ring variables tx_head and tx_tail will manage the UD tx_ring, a
    new cyclic variables global_tx_head and global_tx_tail are introduced for
    managing and counting the overall outstanding sent packets, then the send
    queue will be stopped and waken based on these variables only.
    
    Note that no locking is needed since global_tx_head is updated in the xmit
    flow and global_tx_tail is updated in the NAPI flow only.  A previous
    attempt tried to use one variable to count the outstanding sent packets,
    but it did not work since xmit and NAPI flows can run at the same time and
    the counter will be updated wrongly. Thus, we use the same simple cyclic
    head and tail scheme that we have today for the UD tx_ring.

    RDMA/core: Fix double destruction of uobject
    
    [ Upstream commit c85f4abe66bea0b5db8d28d55da760c4fe0a0301 ]
    
    Fix use after free when user user space request uobject concurrently for
    the same object, within the RCU grace period.
    
    In that case, remove_handle_idr_uobject() is called twice and we will have
    an extra put on the uobject which cause use after free.  Fix it by leaving
    the uobject write locked after it was removed from the idr.
    
    Call to rdma_lookup_put_uobject with UVERBS_LOOKUP_DESTROY instead of
    UVERBS_LOOKUP_WRITE will do the work.

    It's possible for the VFS to completely forget about an inode, but for
    it to still be sitting on the cap release queue. If the MDS sends the
    client a cap message for such an inode, it just ignores it today, which
    can lead to a stall of up to 5s until the cap release queue is flushed.
    
    If we get a cap message for an inode that can't be located, then go
    ahead and flush the cap release queue.

    libceph: ignore pool overlay and cache logic on redirects
    
    [ Upstream commit 890bd0f8997ae6ac0a367dd5146154a3963306dd ]
    
    OSD client should ignore cache/overlay flag if got redirect reply.
    Otherwise, the client hangs when the cache tier is in forward mode.
    
    [ idryomov: Redirects are effectively deprecated and no longer
      used or tested.  The original tiering modes based on redirects
      are inherently flawed because redirects can race and reorder,
      potentially resulting in data corruption.  The new proxy and
      readproxy tiering modes should be used instead of forward and
      readforward.  Still marking for stable as obviously correct,
      though. ]

    ALSA: usb-audio: Quirks for Gigabyte TRX40 Aorus Master onboard audio
    
    [ Upstream commit 7f5ad9c9003425175f46c94df380e8c9e558cfb5 ]
    
    Gigabyte TRX40 Aorus Master is equipped with two USB-audio devices,
    a Realtek ALC1220-VB codec (USB ID 0414:a001) and an ESS SABRE9218 DAC
    (USB ID 0414:a000).  The latter serves solely for the headphone output
    on the front panel while the former serves for the rest I/Os (mostly
    for the I/Os in the rear panel but also including the front mic).
    
    Both chips do work more or less with the unmodified USB-audio driver,
    but there are a few glitches.  The ALC1220-VB returns an error for an
    inquiry to some jacks, as already seen on other TRX40-based mobos.
    However this machine has a slightly incompatible configuration, hence
    the existing mapping cannot be used as is.
    
    Meanwhile the ESS chip seems working without any quirk.  But since
    both audio devices don't provide any specific names, both cards appear
    as "USB-Audio", and it's quite confusing for users.
    
    This patch is an attempt to overcome those issues:
    
    - The specific mapping table for ALC1220-VB is provided, reducing the
      non-working nodes and renaming the badly chosen controls.
      The connector map isn't needed here unlike other TRX40 quirks.
    
    - For both USB IDs (0414:a000 and 0414:a001), provide specific card
      name strings, so that user-space can identify more easily; and more
      importantly, UCM profile can be applied to each.

    exec: Always set cap_ambient in cap_bprm_set_creds
    
    [ Upstream commit a4ae32c71fe90794127b32d26d7ad795813b502e ]
    
    An invariant of cap_bprm_set_creds is that every field in the new cred
    structure that cap_bprm_set_creds might set, needs to be set every
    time to ensure the fields does not get a stale value.
    
    The field cap_ambient is not set every time cap_bprm_set_creds is
    called, which means that if there is a suid or sgid script with an
    interpreter that has neither the suid nor the sgid bits set the
    interpreter should be able to accept ambient credentials.
    Unfortuantely because cap_ambient is not reset to it's original value
    the interpreter can not accept ambient credentials.
    
    Given that the ambient capability set is expected to be controlled by
    the caller, I don't think this is particularly serious.  But it is
    definitely worth fixing so the code works correctly.
    
    I have tested to verify my reading of the code is correct and the
    interpreter of a sgid can receive ambient capabilities with this
    change and cannot receive ambient capabilities without this change.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Add a model for Thinkpad T570 without DAC workaround
    
    [ Upstream commit 399c01aa49e548c82d40f8161915a5941dd3c60e ]
    
    We fixed the regression of the speaker volume for some Thinkpad models
    (e.g. T570) by the commit 54947cd64c1b ("ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix
    speaker output regression on Thinkpad T570").  Essentially it fixes
    the DAC / pin pairing by a static table.  It was confirmed and merged
    to stable kernel later.
    
    Now, interestingly, we got another regression report for the very same
    model (T570) about the similar problem, and the commit above was the
    culprit.  That is, by some reason, there are devices that prefer the
    DAC1, and another device DAC2!
    
    Unfortunately those have the same ID and we have no idea what can
    differentiate, in this patch, a new fixup model "tpt470-dock-fix" is
    provided, so that users with such a machine can apply it manually.
    When model=tpt470-dock-fix option is passed to snd-hda-intel module,
    it avoids the fixed DAC pairing and the DAC1 is assigned to the
    speaker like the earlier versions.

    [ Upstream commit abf56fadf0e208abfb13ad1ac0094416058da0ad ]
    
    The opaque pointer passed to the IRQ handler is a pointer to the
    drm_device, not a pointer to our ingenic_drm structure.
    
    It still worked, because our ingenic_drm structure contains the
    drm_device as its first field, so the pointer received had the same
    value, but this was not semantically correct.

    gpio: exar: Fix bad handling for ida_simple_get error path
    
    [ Upstream commit 333830aa149a87cabeb5d30fbcf12eecc8040d2c ]
    
    The commit 7ecced0934e5 ("gpio: exar: add a check for the return value
    of ida_simple_get fails") added a goto jump to the common error
    handler for ida_simple_get() error, but this is wrong in two ways:
    it doesn't set the proper return code and, more badly, it invokes
    ida_simple_remove() with a negative index that shall lead to a kernel
    panic via BUG_ON().
    
    This patch addresses those two issues.

    ARM: uaccess: fix DACR mismatch with nested exceptions
    
    [ Upstream commit 71f8af1110101facfad68989ff91f88f8e2c3e22 ]
    
    Tomas Paukrt reports that his SAM9X60 based system (ARM926, ARMv5TJ)
    fails to fix up alignment faults, eventually resulting in a kernel
    oops.
    
    The problem occurs when using CONFIG_CPU_USE_DOMAINS with commit
    e6978e4bf181 ("ARM: save and reset the address limit when entering an
    exception").  This is because the address limit is set back to
    TASK_SIZE on exception entry, and, although it is restored on exception
    exit, the domain register is not.
    
    Hence, this sequence can occur:
    
      interrupt
        pt_regs->addr_limit = addr_limit            // USER_DS
        addr_limit = USER_DS
        alignment exception
        __probe_kernel_read()
          old_fs = get_fs()                         // USER_DS
          set_fs(KERNEL_DS)
            addr_limit = KERNEL_DS
            dacr.kernel = DOMAIN_MANAGER
            interrupt
              pt_regs->addr_limit = addr_limit      // KERNEL_DS
              addr_limit = USER_DS
              alignment exception
              __probe_kernel_read()
                old_fs = get_fs()                   // USER_DS
                set_fs(KERNEL_DS)
                  addr_limit = KERNEL_DS
                  dacr.kernel = DOMAIN_MANAGER
                ...
                set_fs(old_fs)
                  addr_limit = USER_DS
                  dacr.kernel = DOMAIN_CLIENT
              ...
              addr_limit = pt_regs->addr_limit      // KERNEL_DS
            interrupt returns
    
    At this point, addr_limit is correctly restored to KERNEL_DS for
    __probe_kernel_read() to continue execution, but dacr.kernel is not,
    it has been reset by the set_fs(old_fs) to DOMAIN_CLIENT.
    
    This would not have happened prior to the mentioned commit, because
    addr_limit would remain KERNEL_DS, so get_fs() would have returned
    KERNEL_DS, and so would correctly nest.
    
    This commit fixes the problem by also saving the DACR on exception
    entry if either CONFIG_CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN or CONFIG_CPU_USE_DOMAINS are
    enabled, and resetting the DACR appropriately on exception entry to
    match addr_limit and PAN settings.

    Fix a use-after-free noticed by running with KASAN enabled. If
    rmi_irq_fn() is run twice in a row, then rmi_f11_attention() (among
    others) will end up reading from drvdata->attn_data.data, which was
    freed and left dangling in rmi_irq_fn().
    
    Commit 55edde9fff1a ("Input: synaptics-rmi4 - prevent UAF reported by
    KASAN") correctly identified and analyzed this bug. However the attempted
    fix only NULLed out a local variable, missing the fact that
    drvdata->attn_data is a struct, not a pointer.
    
    NULL out the correct pointer in the driver data to prevent the attention
    functions from copying from it.

    Input: i8042 - add ThinkPad S230u to i8042 reset list
    
    [ Upstream commit 2712c91a54a1058d55c284152b4d93c979b67be6 ]
    
    On the Lenovo ThinkPad Twist S230u (3347-4HU) with BIOS version
    "GDETC1WW (1.81 ) 06/27/2019", the keyboard, Synaptics TouchPad, and
    TrackPoint either do not function or stop functioning a few minutes
    after boot.  This problem has been noted before, perhaps only occurring
    with BIOS 1.57 and later.[1][2][3][4][5]
    
    Odds of a BIOS fix appear to be low: 1.57 was released over 6 years ago
    and although the [BIOS changelog] notes "Fixed an issue of UEFI
    touchpad/trackpoint/keyboard/touchscreen" in 1.58, it appears to be
    insufficient.
    
    Setting i8042.reset=1 or adding 33474HU to the reset list avoids the
    issue on my system from either warm or cold boot.

    /usr/bin/ld: samples/bpf/lwt_len_hist_user.o:(.bss+0x0): multiple definition of `bpf_log_buf'; samples/bpf/bpf_load.o:(.bss+0x8c0): first defined here
    collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
    
    bpf_log_buf here seems to be a leftover, so removing it.

    csky: Fixup raw_copy_from_user()
    
    [ Upstream commit 51bb38cb78363fdad1f89e87357b7bc73e39ba88 ]
    
    If raw_copy_from_user(to, from, N) returns K, callers expect
    the first N - K bytes starting at to to have been replaced with
    the contents of corresponding area starting at from and the last
    K bytes of destination *left* *unmodified*.
    
    What arch/sky/lib/usercopy.c is doing is broken - it can lead to e.g.
    data corruption on write(2).
    
    raw_copy_to_user() is inaccurate about return value, which is a bug,
    but consequences are less drastic than for raw_copy_from_user().
    And just what are those access_ok() doing in there?  I mean, look into
    linux/uaccess.h; that's where we do that check (as well as zero tail
    on failure in the callers that need zeroing).
    
    AFAICS, all of that shouldn't be hard to fix; something like a patch
    below might make a useful starting point.
    
    I would suggest moving these macros into usercopy.c (they are never
    used anywhere else) and possibly expanding them there; if you leave
    them alive, please at least rename __copy_user_zeroing(). Again,
    it must not zero anything on failed read.
    
    Said that, I'm not sure we won't be better off simply turning
    usercopy.c into usercopy.S - all that is left there is a couple of
    functions, each consisting only of inline asm.
    
    Guo Ren reply:
    
    Yes, raw_copy_from_user is wrong, it's no need zeroing code.
    
    unsigned long _copy_from_user(void *to, const void __user *from,
    unsigned long n)
    {
            unsigned long res = n;
            might_fault();
            if (likely(access_ok(from, n))) {
                    kasan_check_write(to, n);
                    res = raw_copy_from_user(to, from, n);
            }
            if (unlikely(res))
                    memset(to + (n - res), 0, res);
            return res;
    }
    EXPORT_SYMBOL(_copy_from_user);
    
    You are right and access_ok() should be removed.
    
    but, how about:
    do {
    ...
            "2:     stw     %3, (%1, 0)     \n"             \
    +       "       subi    %0, 4          \n"               \
            "9:     stw     %4, (%1, 4)     \n"             \
    +       "       subi    %0, 4          \n"               \
            "10:    stw     %5, (%1, 8)     \n"             \
    +       "       subi    %0, 4          \n"               \
            "11:    stw     %6, (%1, 12)    \n"             \
    +       "       subi    %0, 4          \n"               \
            "       addi    %2, 16          \n"             \
            "       addi    %1, 16          \n"             \
    
    Don't expand __ex_table
    
    AI Viro reply:
    
    Hey, I've no idea about the instruction scheduling on csky -
    if that doesn't slow the things down, all the better.  It's just
    that copy_to_user() and friends are on fairly hot codepaths,
    and in quite a few situations they will dominate the speed of
    e.g. read(2).  So I tried to keep the fast path unchanged.
    Up to the architecture maintainers, obviously.  Which would be
    you...
    
    As for the fixups size increase (__ex_table size is unchanged)...
    You have each of those macros expanded exactly once.
    So the size is not a serious argument, IMO - useless complexity
    would be, if it is, in fact, useless; the size... not really,
    especially since those extra subi will at least offset it.
    
    Again, up to you - asm optimizations of (essentially)
    memcpy()-style loops are tricky and can depend upon the
    fairly subtle details of architecture.  So even on something
    I know reasonably well I would resort to direct experiments
    if I can't pass the buck to architecture maintainers.
    
    It *is* worth optimizing - this is where read() from a file
    that is already in page cache spends most of the time, etc.
    
    Guo Ren reply:
    
    Thx, after fixup some typo “sub %0, 4”, apply the patch.
    
    TODO:
     - user copy/from codes are still need optimizing.

    [ Upstream commit dc6dbd51009fc412729c307161f442c0a08618f4 ]
    
    Right now, trying to use RTC purely with the ti-sysc / clkctrl framework
    fails to enable the RTC module properly. Based on experimentation, this
    appears to be because RTC is sourced from the clkdiv32k optional clock.
    TRM is not very clear on this topic, but fix the RTC to use the proper
    source clock nevertheless.

    net: freescale: select CONFIG_FIXED_PHY where needed
    
    [ Upstream commit 99352c79af3e5f2e4724abf37fa5a2a3299b1c81 ]
    
    I ran into a randconfig build failure with CONFIG_FIXED_PHY=m
    and CONFIG_GIANFAR=y:
    
    x86_64-linux-ld: drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/gianfar.o:(.rodata+0x418): undefined reference to `fixed_phy_change_carrier'
    
    It seems the same thing can happen with dpaa and ucc_geth, so change
    all three to do an explicit 'select FIXED_PHY'.
    
    The fixed-phy driver actually has an alternative stub function that
    theoretically allows building network drivers when fixed-phy is
    disabled, but I don't see how that would help here, as the drivers
    presumably would not work then.

    cachefiles: Fix race between read_waiter and read_copier involving op->to_do
    
    [ Upstream commit 7bb0c5338436dae953622470d52689265867f032 ]
    
    There is a potential race in fscache operation enqueuing for reading and
    copying multiple pages from cachefiles to netfs.  The problem can be seen
    easily on a heavy loaded system (for example many processes reading files
    continually on an NFS share covered by fscache triggered this problem within
    a few minutes).
    
    The race is due to cachefiles_read_waiter() adding the op to the monitor
    to_do list and then then drop the object->work_lock spinlock before
    completing fscache_enqueue_operation().  Once the lock is dropped,
    cachefiles_read_copier() grabs the op, completes processing it, and
    makes it through fscache_retrieval_complete() which sets the op->state to
    the final state of FSCACHE_OP_ST_COMPLETE(4).  When cachefiles_read_waiter()
    finally gets through the remainder of fscache_enqueue_operation()
    it sees the invalid state, and hits the ASSERTCMP and the following
    oops is seen:

    Releasing the AMDGPU BO ref directly leads to problems when BOs were
    exported as DMA bufs. Releasing the GEM reference makes sure that the
    AMDGPU/TTM BO is not freed too early.
    
    Also take a GEM reference when importing BOs from DMABufs to keep
    references to imported BOs balances properly.

    [ Upstream commit 4ed0c30811cb4d30ef89850b787a53a84d5d2bcb ]
    
    Before this patch, function gfs2_quota_lock checked if it was called
    from a privileged user, and if so, it bypassed the quota check:
    superuser can operate outside the quotas.
    That's the wrong place for the check because the lock/unlock functions
    are separate from the lock_check function, and you can do lock and
    unlock without actually checking the quotas.
    
    This patch moves the check to gfs2_quota_lock_check.

    [ Upstream commit 0cf253eed5d2bdf7bb3152457b38f39b012955f7 ]
    
    The driver currently leaves GPIO IRQs unmasked even when the GPIO IRQ
    client has released the GPIO IRQ. This allows the HW to raise IRQs, and
    SW to process them, after shutdown. Fix this by masking the IRQ when it's
    shut down. This is usually taken care of by the irqchip core, but since
    this driver has a custom irq_shutdown implementation, it must do this
    explicitly itself.

    arm64: dts: rockchip: swap interrupts interrupt-names rk3399 gpu node
    
    [ Upstream commit c604fd810bda667bdc20b2c041917baa7803e0fb ]
    
    Dts files with Rockchip rk3399 'gpu' nodes were manually verified.
    In order to automate this process arm,mali-midgard.txt
    has been converted to yaml. In the new setup dtbs_check with
    arm,mali-midgard.yaml expects interrupts and interrupt-names values
    in the same order. Fix this for rk3399.

    mlxsw: spectrum: Fix use-after-free of split/unsplit/type_set in case reload fails
    
    commit 4340f42f207eacb81e7a6b6bb1e3b6afad9a2e26 upstream.
    
    In case of reload fail, the mlxsw_sp->ports contains a pointer to a
    freed memory (either by reload_down() or reload_up() error path).
    Fix this by initializing the pointer to NULL and checking it before

    sctp: Start shutdown on association restart if in SHUTDOWN-SENT state and socket is closed
    
    [ Upstream commit d3e8e4c11870413789f029a71e72ae6e971fe678 ]
    
    Commit bdf6fa52f01b ("sctp: handle association restarts when the
    socket is closed.") starts shutdown when an association is restarted,
    if in SHUTDOWN-PENDING state and the socket is closed. However, the
    rationale stated in that commit applies also when in SHUTDOWN-SENT
    state - we don't want to move an association to ESTABLISHED state when
    the socket has been closed, because that results in an association
    that is unreachable from user space.
    
    The problem scenario:
    
    1.  Client crashes and/or restarts.
    
    2.  Server (using one-to-one socket) calls close(). SHUTDOWN is lost.
    
    3.  Client reconnects using the same addresses and ports.
    
    4.  Server's association is restarted. The association and the socket
        move to ESTABLISHED state, even though the server process has
        closed its descriptor.
    
    Also, after step 4 when the server process exits, some resources are
    leaked in an attempt to release the underlying inet sock structure in
    ESTABLISHED state:
    
        IPv4: Attempt to release TCP socket in state 1 00000000377288c7
    
    Fix by acting the same way as in SHUTDOWN-PENDING state. That is, if
    an association is restarted in SHUTDOWN-SENT state and the socket is
    closed, then start shutdown and don't move the association or the
    socket to ESTABLISHED state.

    It appears that the side effect that starts the shutdown timer was processed
    multiple times, which can happen as multiple paths can trigger it.  This of
    course leads to the BUG halt in add_timer getting called.
    
    Fix seems pretty straightforward, just check before the timer is added if its
    already been started.  If it has mod the timer instead to min(current
    expiration, new expiration)
    
    Its been tested but not confirmed to fix the problem, as the issue has only
    occured in production environments where test kernels are enjoined from being
    installed.  It appears to be a sane fix to me though.  Also, recentely,
    Jere found a reproducer posted on list to confirm that this resolves the
    issues

    Device id 0927 is the RTL8153B-based component of the 'Surface USB-C to
    Ethernet and USB Adapter' and may be used as a component of other devices
    in future. Tested and working with the r8152 driver.
    
    Update the cdc_ether blacklist due to the RTL8153 'network jam on suspend'
    issue which this device will cause (personally confirmed).

    nexthop: Fix attribute checking for groups
    
    [ Upstream commit 84be69b869a5a496a6cfde9b3c29509207a1f1fa ]
    
    For nexthop groups, attributes after NHA_GROUP_TYPE are invalid, but
    nh_check_attr_group starts checking at NHA_GROUP. The group type defaults
    to multipath and the NHA_GROUP_TYPE is currently optional so this has
    slipped through so far. Fix the attribute checking to handle support of
    new group types.

    net/tls: fix race condition causing kernel panic
    
    [ Upstream commit 0cada33241d9de205522e3858b18e506ca5cce2c ]
    
    tls_sw_recvmsg() and tls_decrypt_done() can be run concurrently.
    // tls_sw_recvmsg()
            if (atomic_read(&ctx->decrypt_pending))
                    crypto_wait_req(-EINPROGRESS, &ctx->async_wait);
            else
                    reinit_completion(&ctx->async_wait.completion);
    
    //tls_decrypt_done()
            pending = atomic_dec_return(&ctx->decrypt_pending);
    
            if (!pending && READ_ONCE(ctx->async_notify))
                    complete(&ctx->async_wait.completion);
    
    Consider the scenario tls_decrypt_done() is about to run complete()
    
            if (!pending && READ_ONCE(ctx->async_notify))
    
    and tls_sw_recvmsg() reads decrypt_pending == 0, does reinit_completion(),
    then tls_decrypt_done() runs complete(). This sequence of execution
    results in wrong completion. Consequently, for next decrypt request,
    it will not wait for completion, eventually on connection close, crypto
    resources freed, there is no way to handle pending decrypt response.
    
    This race condition can be avoided by having atomic_read() mutually
    exclusive with atomic_dec_return(),complete().Intoduced spin lock to
    ensure the mutual exclution.
    
    Addressed similar problem in tx direction.
    
    v1->v2:
    - More readable commit message.
    - Corrected the lock to fix new race scenario.
    - Removed barrier which is not needed now.

    When a new action is installed, firstuse field of 'tcf_t' is explicitly set
    to 0. Value of zero means "new action, not yet used"; as a packet hits the
    action, 'firstuse' is stamped with the current jiffies value.
    
    tcf_tm_dump() should return 0 for firstuse if action has not yet been hit.

    net: revert "net: get rid of an signed integer overflow in ip_idents_reserve()"
    
    [ Upstream commit a6211caa634da39d861a47437ffcda8b38ef421b ]
    
    Commit adb03115f459 ("net: get rid of an signed integer overflow in ip_idents_reserve()")
    used atomic_cmpxchg to replace "atomic_add_return" inside the function
    "ip_idents_reserve". The reason was to avoid UBSAN warning.
    However, this change has caused performance degrade and in GCC-8,
    fno-strict-overflow is now mapped to -fwrapv -fwrapv-pointer
    and signed integer overflow is now undefined by default at all
    optimization levels[1]. Moreover, it was a bug in UBSAN vs -fwrapv
    /-fno-strict-overflow, so Let's revert it safely.

    [ Upstream commit d28ea1fbbf437054ef339afec241019f2c4e2bb6 ]
    
    Once the traversal of the list is completed with list_for_each_entry(),
    the iterator (node) will point to an invalid object. So passing this to
    qrtr_local_enqueue() which is outside of the iterator block is erroneous
    eventhough the object is not used.
    
    So fix this by passing NULL to qrtr_local_enqueue().

    net: mvpp2: fix RX hashing for non-10G ports
    
    [ Upstream commit 3138a07ce219acde4c0d7ea0b6d54ba64153328b ]
    
    When rxhash is enabled on any ethernet port except the first in each CP
    block, traffic flow is prevented.  The analysis is below:
    
    I've been investigating this afternoon, and what I've found, comparing
    a kernel without 895586d5dc32 and with 895586d5dc32 applied is:
    
    - The table programmed into the hardware via mvpp22_rss_fill_table()
      appears to be identical with or without the commit.
    
    - When rxhash is enabled on eth2, mvpp2_rss_port_c2_enable() reports
      that c2.attr[0] and c2.attr[2] are written back containing:
    
       - with 895586d5dc32, failing:    00200000 40000000
       - without 895586d5dc32, working: 04000000 40000000
    
    - When disabling rxhash, c2.attr[0] and c2.attr[2] are written back as:
    
       04000000 00000000
    
    The second value represents the MVPP22_CLS_C2_ATTR2_RSS_EN bit, the
    first value is the queue number, which comprises two fields. The high
    5 bits are 24:29 and the low three are 21:23 inclusive. This comes
    from:
    
           c2.attr[0] = MVPP22_CLS_C2_ATTR0_QHIGH(qh) |
                         MVPP22_CLS_C2_ATTR0_QLOW(ql);
    
    So, the working case gives eth2 a queue id of 4.0, or 32 as per
    port->first_rxq, and the non-working case a queue id of 0.1, or 1.
    The allocation of queue IDs seems to be in mvpp2_port_probe():
    
            if (priv->hw_version == MVPP21)
                    port->first_rxq = port->id * port->nrxqs;
            else
                    port->first_rxq = port->id * priv->max_port_rxqs;
    
    Where:
    
            if (priv->hw_version == MVPP21)
                    priv->max_port_rxqs = 8;
            else
                    priv->max_port_rxqs = 32;
    
    Making the port 0 (eth0 / eth1) have port->first_rxq = 0, and port 1
    (eth2) be 32. It seems the idea is that the first 32 queues belong to
    port 0, the second 32 queues belong to port 1, etc.
    
    mvpp2_rss_port_c2_enable() gets the queue number from it's parameter,
    'ctx', which comes from mvpp22_rss_ctx(port, 0). This returns
    port->rss_ctx[0].
    
    mvpp22_rss_context_create() is responsible for allocating that, which
    it does by looking for an unallocated priv->rss_tables[] pointer. This
    table is shared amongst all ports on the CP silicon.
    
    When we write the tables in mvpp22_rss_fill_table(), the RSS table
    entry is defined by:
    
                    u32 sel = MVPP22_RSS_INDEX_TABLE(rss_ctx) |
                              MVPP22_RSS_INDEX_TABLE_ENTRY(i);
    
    where rss_ctx is the context ID (queue number) and i is the index in
    the table.
    
    If we look at what is written:
    
    - The first table to be written has "sel" values of 00000000..0000001f,
      containing values 0..3. This appears to be for eth1. This is table 0,
      RX queue number 0.
    - The second table has "sel" values of 00000100..0000011f, and appears
      to be for eth2.  These contain values 0x20..0x23. This is table 1,
      RX queue number 0.
    - The third table has "sel" values of 00000200..0000021f, and appears
      to be for eth3.  These contain values 0x40..0x43. This is table 2,
      RX queue number 0.
    
    How do queue numbers translate to the RSS table?  There is another
    table - the RXQ2RSS table, indexed by the MVPP22_RSS_INDEX_QUEUE field
    of MVPP22_RSS_INDEX and accessed through the MVPP22_RXQ2RSS_TABLE
    register. Before 895586d5dc32, it was:
    
           mvpp2_write(priv, MVPP22_RSS_INDEX,
                       MVPP22_RSS_INDEX_QUEUE(port->first_rxq));
           mvpp2_write(priv, MVPP22_RXQ2RSS_TABLE,
                       MVPP22_RSS_TABLE_POINTER(port->id));
    
    and after:
    
           mvpp2_write(priv, MVPP22_RSS_INDEX, MVPP22_RSS_INDEX_QUEUE(ctx));
           mvpp2_write(priv, MVPP22_RXQ2RSS_TABLE, MVPP22_RSS_TABLE_POINTER(ctx));
    
    Before the commit, for eth2, that would've contained '32' for the
    index and '1' for the table pointer - mapping queue 32 to table 1.
    Remember that this is queue-high.queue-low of 4.0.
    
    After the commit, we appear to map queue 1 to table 1. That again
    looks fine on the face of it.
    
    Section 9.3.1 of the A8040 manual seems indicate the reason that the
    queue number is separated. queue-low seems to always come from the
    classifier, whereas queue-high can be from the ingress physical port
    number or the classifier depending on the MVPP2_CLS_SWFWD_PCTRL_REG.
    
    We set the port bit in MVPP2_CLS_SWFWD_PCTRL_REG, meaning that queue-high
    comes from the MVPP2_CLS_SWFWD_P2HQ_REG() register... and this seems to
    be where our bug comes from.
    
    mvpp2_cls_oversize_rxq_set() sets this up as:
    
            mvpp2_write(port->priv, MVPP2_CLS_SWFWD_P2HQ_REG(port->id),
                        (port->first_rxq >> MVPP2_CLS_OVERSIZE_RXQ_LOW_BITS));
    
            val = mvpp2_read(port->priv, MVPP2_CLS_SWFWD_PCTRL_REG);
            val |= MVPP2_CLS_SWFWD_PCTRL_MASK(port->id);
            mvpp2_write(port->priv, MVPP2_CLS_SWFWD_PCTRL_REG, val);
    
    Setting the MVPP2_CLS_SWFWD_PCTRL_MASK bit means that the queue-high
    for eth2 is _always_ 4, so only queues 32 through 39 inclusive are
    available to eth2. Yet, we're trying to tell the classifier to set
    queue-high, which will be ignored, to zero. Hence, the queue-high
    field (MVPP22_CLS_C2_ATTR0_QHIGH()) from the classifier will be
    ignored.
    
    This means we end up directing traffic from eth2 not to queue 1, but
    to queue 33, and then we tell it to look up queue 33 in the RSS table.
    However, RSS table has not been programmed for queue 33, and so it ends
    up (presumably) dropping the packets.
    
    It seems that mvpp22_rss_context_create() doesn't take account of the
    fact that the upper 5 bits of the queue ID can't actually be changed
    due to the settings in mvpp2_cls_oversize_rxq_set(), _or_ it seems that
    mvpp2_cls_oversize_rxq_set() has been missed in this commit. Either
    way, these two functions mutually disagree with what queue number
    should be used.
    
    Looking deeper into what mvpp2_cls_oversize_rxq_set() and the MTU
    validation is doing, it seems that MVPP2_CLS_SWFWD_P2HQ_REG() is used
    for over-sized packets attempting to egress through this port. With
    the classifier having had RSS enabled and directing eth2 traffic to
    queue 1, we may still have packets appearing on queue 32 for this port.
    
    However, the only way we may end up with over-sized packets attempting
    to egress through eth2 - is if the A8040 forwards frames between its
    ports. From what I can see, we don't support that feature, and the
    kernel restricts the egress packet size to the MTU. In any case, if we
    were to attempt to transmit an oversized packet, we have no support in
    the kernel to deal with that appearing in the port's receive queue.
    
    So, this patch attempts to solve the issue by clearing the
    MVPP2_CLS_SWFWD_PCTRL_MASK() bit, allowing MVPP22_CLS_C2_ATTR0_QHIGH()
    from the classifier to define the queue-high field of the queue number.
    
    My testing seems to confirm my findings above - clearing this bit
    means that if I enable rxhash on eth2, the interface can then pass
    traffic, as we are now directing traffic to RX queue 1 rather than
    queue 33. Traffic still seems to work with rxhash off as well.

    [ Upstream commit 17d00e839d3b592da9659c1977d45f85b77f986a ]
    
    When FW response to commands is very slow and all command entries in
    use are waiting for completion we can have a race where commands can get
    timeout before they get out of the queue and handled. Timeout
    completion on uninitialized command will cause releasing command's
    buffers before accessing it for initialization and then we will get NULL
    pointer exception while trying access it. It may also cause releasing
    buffers of another command since we may have timeout completion before
    even allocating entry index for this command.
    Add entry handling completion to avoid this race.

    net: inet_csk: Fix so_reuseport bind-address cache in tb->fast*
    
    [ Upstream commit 88d7fcfa3b1fe670f0412b95be785aafca63352b ]
    
    The commit 637bc8bbe6c0 ("inet: reset tb->fastreuseport when adding a reuseport sk")
    added a bind-address cache in tb->fast*.  The tb->fast* caches the address
    of a sk which has successfully been binded with SO_REUSEPORT ON.  The idea
    is to avoid the expensive conflict search in inet_csk_bind_conflict().
    
    There is an issue with wildcard matching where sk_reuseport_match() should
    have returned false but it is currently returning true.  It ends up
    hiding bind conflict.  For example,
    
    bind("[::1]:443"); /* without SO_REUSEPORT. Succeed. */
    bind("[::2]:443"); /* with    SO_REUSEPORT. Succeed. */
    bind("[::]:443");  /* with    SO_REUSEPORT. Still Succeed where it shouldn't */
    
    The last bind("[::]:443") with SO_REUSEPORT on should have failed because
    it should have a conflict with the very first bind("[::1]:443") which
    has SO_REUSEPORT off.  However, the address "[::2]" is cached in
    tb->fast* in the second bind. In the last bind, the sk_reuseport_match()
    returns true because the binding sk's wildcard addr "[::]" matches with
    the "[::2]" cached in tb->fast*.
    
    The correct bind conflict is reported by removing the second
    bind such that tb->fast* cache is not involved and forces the
    bind("[::]:443") to go through the inet_csk_bind_conflict():
    
    bind("[::1]:443"); /* without SO_REUSEPORT. Succeed. */
    bind("[::]:443");  /* with    SO_REUSEPORT. -EADDRINUSE */
    
    The expected behavior for sk_reuseport_match() is, it should only allow
    the "cached" tb->fast* address to be used as a wildcard match but not
    the address of the binding sk.  To do that, the current
    "bool match_wildcard" arg is split into
    "bool match_sk1_wildcard" and "bool match_sk2_wildcard".
    
    This change only affects the sk_reuseport_match() which is only
    used by inet_csk (e.g. TCP).
    The other use cases are calling inet_rcv_saddr_equal() and
    this patch makes it pass the same "match_wildcard" arg twice to
    the "ipv[46]_rcv_saddr_equal(..., match_wildcard, match_wildcard)".

    net: dsa: mt7530: fix roaming from DSA user ports
    
    [ Upstream commit 5e5502e012b8129e11be616acb0f9c34bc8f8adb ]
    
    When a client moves from a DSA user port to a software port in a bridge,
    it cannot reach any other clients that connected to the DSA user ports.
    That is because SA learning on the CPU port is disabled, so the switch
    ignores the client's frames from the CPU port and still thinks it is at
    the user port.
    
    Fix it by enabling SA learning on the CPU port.
    
    To prevent the switch from learning from flooding frames from the CPU
    port, set skb->offload_fwd_mark to 1 for unicast and broadcast frames,
    and let the switch flood them instead of trapping to the CPU port.
    Multicast frames still need to be trapped to the CPU port for snooping,
    so set the SA_DIS bit of the MTK tag to 1 when transmitting those frames
    to disable SA learning.

    net: don't return invalid table id error when we fall back to PF_UNSPEC
    
    [ Upstream commit 41b4bd986f86331efc599b9a3f5fb86ad92e9af9 ]
    
    In case we can't find a ->dumpit callback for the requested
    (family,type) pair, we fall back to (PF_UNSPEC,type). In effect, we're
    in the same situation as if userspace had requested a PF_UNSPEC
    dump. For RTM_GETROUTE, that handler is rtnl_dump_all, which calls all
    the registered RTM_GETROUTE handlers.
    
    The requested table id may or may not exist for all of those
    families. commit ae677bbb4441 ("net: Don't return invalid table id
    error when dumping all families") fixed the problem when userspace
    explicitly requests a PF_UNSPEC dump, but missed the fallback case.
    
    For example, when we pass ipv6.disable=1 to a kernel with
    CONFIG_IP_MROUTE=y and CONFIG_IP_MROUTE_MULTIPLE_TABLES=y,
    the (PF_INET6, RTM_GETROUTE) handler isn't registered, so we end up in
    rtnl_dump_all, and listing IPv6 routes will unexpectedly print:
    
      # ip -6 r
      Error: ipv4: MR table does not exist.
      Dump terminated
    
    commit ae677bbb4441 introduced the dump_all_families variable, which
    gets set when userspace requests a PF_UNSPEC dump. However, we can't
    simply set the family to PF_UNSPEC in rtnetlink_rcv_msg in the
    fallback case to get dump_all_families == true, because some messages
    types (for example RTM_GETRULE and RTM_GETNEIGH) only register the
    PF_UNSPEC handler and use the family to filter in the kernel what is
    dumped to userspace. We would then export more entries, that userspace
    would have to filter. iproute does that, but other programs may not.
    
    Instead, this patch removes dump_all_families and updates the
    RTM_GETROUTE handlers to check if the family that is being dumped is
    their own. When it's not, which covers both the intentional PF_UNSPEC
    dumps (as dump_all_families did) and the fallback case, ignore the
    missing table id error.

    dpaa_eth: fix usage as DSA master, try 3
    
    [ Upstream commit 5d14c304bfc14b4fd052dc83d5224376b48f52f0 ]
    
    The dpaa-eth driver probes on compatible string for the MAC node, and
    the fman/mac.c driver allocates a dpaa-ethernet platform device that
    triggers the probing of the dpaa-eth net device driver.
    
    All of this is fine, but the problem is that the struct device of the
    dpaa_eth net_device is 2 parents away from the MAC which can be
    referenced via of_node. So of_find_net_device_by_node can't find it, and
    DSA switches won't be able to probe on top of FMan ports.
    
    It would be a bit silly to modify a core function
    (of_find_net_device_by_node) to look for dev->parent->parent->of_node
    just for one driver. We're just 1 step away from implementing full
    recursion.
    
    Actually there have already been at least 2 previous attempts to make
    this work:
    - Commit a1a50c8e4c24 ("fsl/man: Inherit parent device and of_node")
    - One or more of the patches in "[v3,0/6] adapt DPAA drivers for DSA":
      https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/cover/1508178970-28945-1-git-send-email-madalin.bucur@nxp.com/
      (I couldn't really figure out which one was supposed to solve the
      problem and how).
    
    Point being, it looks like this is still pretty much a problem today.
    On T1040, the /sys/class/net/eth0 symlink currently points to
    
    ../../devices/platform/ffe000000.soc/ffe400000.fman/ffe4e6000.ethernet/dpaa-ethernet.0/net/eth0
    
    which pretty much illustrates the problem. The closest of_node we've got
    is the "fsl,fman-memac" at /soc@ffe000000/fman@400000/ethernet@e6000,
    which is what we'd like to be able to reference from DSA as host port.
    
    For of_find_net_device_by_node to find the eth0 port, we would need the
    parent of the eth0 net_device to not be the "dpaa-ethernet" platform
    device, but to point 1 level higher, aka the "fsl,fman-memac" node
    directly. The new sysfs path would look like this:
    
    ../../devices/platform/ffe000000.soc/ffe400000.fman/ffe4e6000.ethernet/net/eth0
    
    And this is exactly what SET_NETDEV_DEV does. It sets the parent of the
    net_device. The new parent has an of_node associated with it, and
    of_dev_node_match already checks for the of_node of the device or of its
    parent.
    
    Fixes: a1a50c8e4c24 ("fsl/man: Inherit parent device and of_node")
    Fixes: c6e26ea8c893 ("dpaa_eth: change device used")

    ax25: fix setsockopt(SO_BINDTODEVICE)
    
    [ Upstream commit 687775cec056b38a4c8f3291e0dd7a9145f7b667 ]
    
    syzbot was able to trigger this trace [1], probably by using
    a zero optlen.
    
    While we are at it, cap optlen to IFNAMSIZ - 1 instead of IFNAMSIZ.
