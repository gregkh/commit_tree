    sctp: validate from_addr_param return
    
    commit 0c5dc070ff3d6246d22ddd931f23a6266249e3db upstream.
    
    Ilja reported that, simply putting it, nothing was validating that
    from_addr_param functions were operating on initialized memory. That is,
    the parameter itself was being validated by sctp_walk_params, but it
    doesn't check for types and their specific sizes and it could be a 0-length
    one, causing from_addr_param to potentially work over the next parameter or
    even uninitialized memory.
    
    The fix here is to, in all calls to from_addr_param, check if enough space
    is there for the wanted IP address type.

    drm/nouveau/nvkm: Replace -ENOSYS with -ENODEV
    
    commit e8f71f89236ef82d449991bfbc237e3cb6ea584f upstream.
    
    nvkm test builds fail with the following error.
    
      drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/engine/device/ctrl.c: In function 'nvkm_control_mthd_pstate_info':
      drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/engine/device/ctrl.c:60:35: error: overflow in conversion from 'int' to '__s8' {aka 'signed char'} changes value from '-251' to '5'
    
    The code builds on most architectures, but fails on parisc where ENOSYS
    is defined as 251.
    
    Replace the error code with -ENODEV (-19).  The actual error code does
    not really matter and is not passed to userspace - it just has to be
    negative.

    blk-throttle: fix UAF by deleteing timer in blk_throtl_exit()
    
    [ Upstream commit 884f0e84f1e3195b801319c8ec3d5774e9bf2710 ]
    
    The pending timer has been set up in blk_throtl_init(). However, the
    timer is not deleted in blk_throtl_exit(). This means that the timer
    handler may still be running after freeing the timer, which would
    result in a use-after-free.
    
    Fix by calling del_timer_sync() to delete the timer in blk_throtl_exit().

    nilfs2: fix NULL pointer in nilfs_##name##_attr_release
    
    [ Upstream commit dbc6e7d44a514f231a64d9d5676e001b660b6448 ]
    
    In nilfs_##name##_attr_release, kobj->parent should not be referenced
    because it is a NULL pointer.  The release() method of kobject is always
    called in kobject_put(kobj), in the implementation of kobject_put(), the
    kobj->parent will be assigned as NULL before call the release() method.
    So just use kobj to get the subgroups, which is more efficient and can fix
    a NULL pointer reference problem.

    If kobject_init_and_add return with error, then the cleanup of kobject
    is needed because memory may be allocated in kobject_init_and_add
    without freeing.
    
    And the place of cleanup_dev_kobject should use kobject_put to free the
    memory associated with the kobject.  As the section "Kobject removal" of
    "Documentation/core-api/kobject.rst" says, kobject_del() just makes the
    kobject "invisible", but it is not cleaned up.  And no more cleanup will
    do after cleanup_dev_kobject, so kobject_put is needed here.

    profiling: fix shift-out-of-bounds bugs
    
    commit 2d186afd04d669fe9c48b994c41a7405a3c9f16d upstream.
    
    Syzbot reported shift-out-of-bounds bug in profile_init().
    The problem was in incorrect prof_shift. Since prof_shift value comes from
    userspace we need to clamp this value into [0, BITS_PER_LONG -1]
    boundaries.
    
    Second possible shiht-out-of-bounds was found by Tetsuo:
    sample_step local variable in read_profile() had "unsigned int" type,
    but prof_shift allows to make a BITS_PER_LONG shift. So, to prevent
    possible shiht-out-of-bounds sample_step type was changed to
    "unsigned long".
    
    Also, "unsigned short int" will be sufficient for storing
    [0, BITS_PER_LONG] value, that's why there is no need for
    "unsigned long" prof_shift.

    prctl: allow to setup brk for et_dyn executables
    
    commit e1fbbd073137a9d63279f6bf363151a938347640 upstream.
    
    Keno Fischer reported that when a binray loaded via ld-linux-x the
    prctl(PR_SET_MM_MAP) doesn't allow to setup brk value because it lays
    before mm:end_data.
    
    For example a test program shows
    
     | # ~/t
     |
     | start_code      401000
     | end_code        401a15
     | start_stack     7ffce4577dd0
     | start_data      403e10
     | end_data        40408c
     | start_brk       b5b000
     | sbrk(0)         b5b000
    
    and when executed via ld-linux
    
     | # /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 ~/t
     |
     | start_code      7fc25b0a4000
     | end_code        7fc25b0c4524
     | start_stack     7fffcc6b2400
     | start_data      7fc25b0ce4c0
     | end_data        7fc25b0cff98
     | start_brk       55555710c000
     | sbrk(0)         55555710c000
    
    This of course prevent criu from restoring such programs.  Looking into
    how kernel operates with brk/start_brk inside brk() syscall I don't see
    any problem if we allow to setup brk/start_brk without checking for
    end_data.  Even if someone pass some weird address here on a purpose then
    the worst possible result will be an unexpected unmapping of existing vma
    (own vma, since prctl works with the callers memory) but test for
    RLIMIT_DATA is still valid and a user won't be able to gain more memory in
    case of expanding VMAs via new values shipped with prctl call.

    sctp: add param size validation for SCTP_PARAM_SET_PRIMARY
    
    commit ef6c8d6ccf0c1dccdda092ebe8782777cd7803c9 upstream.
    
    When SCTP handles an INIT chunk, it calls for example:
    sctp_sf_do_5_1B_init
      sctp_verify_init
        sctp_verify_param
      sctp_process_init
        sctp_process_param
          handling of SCTP_PARAM_SET_PRIMARY
    
    sctp_verify_init() wasn't doing proper size validation and neither the
    later handling, allowing it to work over the chunk itself, possibly being
    uninitialized memory.

    sctp: validate chunk size in __rcv_asconf_lookup
    
    commit b6ffe7671b24689c09faa5675dd58f93758a97ae upstream.
    
    In one of the fallbacks that SCTP has for identifying an association for an
    incoming packet, it looks for AddIp chunk (from ASCONF) and take a peek.
    Thing is, at this stage nothing was validating that the chunk actually had
    enough content for that, allowing the peek to happen over uninitialized
    memory.
    
    Similar check already exists in actual asconf handling in
    sctp_verify_asconf().

    PM / wakeirq: Fix unbalanced IRQ enable for wakeirq
    
    commit 69728051f5bf15efaf6edfbcfe1b5a49a2437918 upstream.
    
    If a device is runtime PM suspended when we enter suspend and has
    a dedicated wake IRQ, we can get the following warning:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 108 at kernel/irq/manage.c:526 enable_irq+0x40/0x94
    [  102.087860] Unbalanced enable for IRQ 147

    (dev_pm_arm_wake_irq) from [<c0618360>]
     (device_wakeup_arm_wake_irqs+0x58/0x9c)

    (pm_suspend) from [<c01ab3e8>] (state_store+0x68/0xc8)
    
    This is because the dedicated wake IRQ for the device may have been
    already enabled earlier by dev_pm_enable_wake_irq_check().  Fix the
    issue by checking for runtime PM suspended status.
    
    This issue can be easily reproduced by setting serial console log level
    to zero, letting the serial console idle, and suspend the system from
    an ssh terminal.  On resume, dmesg will have the warning above.
    
    The reason why I have not run into this issue earlier has been that I
    typically run my PM test cases from on a serial console instead over ssh.

    s390/bpf: Fix optimizing out zero-extensions
    
    commit db7bee653859ef7179be933e7d1384644f795f26 upstream.
    
    Currently the JIT completely removes things like `reg32 += 0`,
    however, the BPF_ALU semantics requires the target register to be
    zero-extended in such cases.
    
    Fix by optimizing out only the arithmetic operation, but not the
    subsequent zero-extension.
