    ALSA: hda - hdmi: call overridden init on resume
    
    commit a283368382c50345dff61525f493ea307f21ec9b upstream.
    
    We need to call the proper init function in case it has been
    overridden, as it might restore things that the generic routing
    doesn't know anything about. E.g. AMD cards have special verbs
    that need resetting.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix races at disconnection and PCM closing
    
    commit 92a586bdc06de6629dae1b357dac221253f55ff8 upstream.
    
    When a USB-audio device is disconnected while PCM is still running, we
    still see some race: the disconnect callback calls
    snd_usb_endpoint_free() that calls release_urbs() and then kfree()
    while a PCM stream would be closed at the same time and calls
    stop_endpoints() that leads to wait_clear_urbs().  That is, the EP
    object might be deallocated while a PCM stream is syncing with
    wait_clear_urbs() with the same EP.
    
    Basically calling multiple wait_clear_urbs() would work fine, also
    calling wait_clear_urbs() and release_urbs() would work, too, as
    wait_clear_urbs() just reads some fields in ep.  The problem is the
    succeeding kfree() in snd_pcm_endpoint_free().
    
    This patch moves out the EP deallocation into the later point, the
    destructor callback.  At this stage, all PCMs must have been already
    closed, so it's safe to free the objects.

    tracing: Fix syscall_*regfunc() vs copy_process() race
    
    commit 4af4206be2bd1933cae20c2b6fb2058dbc887f7c upstream.
    
    syscall_regfunc() and syscall_unregfunc() should set/clear
    TIF_SYSCALL_TRACEPOINT system-wide, but do_each_thread() can race
    with copy_process() and miss the new child which was not added to

    tracing: Try again for saved cmdline if failed due to locking
    
    commit 379cfdac37923653c9d4242d10052378b7563005 upstream.
    
    In order to prevent the saved cmdline cache from being filled when
    tracing is not active, the comms are only recorded after a trace event
    is recorded.
    
    The problem is, a comm can fail to be recorded if the trace_cmdline_lock
    is held. That lock is taken via a trylock to allow it to happen from
    any context (including NMI). If the lock fails to be taken, the comm
    is skipped. No big deal, as we will try again later.
    
    But! Because of the code that was added to only record after an event,
    we may not try again later as the recording is made as a oneshot per
    event per CPU.
    
    Only disable the recording of the comm if the comm is actually recorded.

    lz4: add overrun checks to lz4_uncompress_unknownoutputsize()
    
    commit 4a3a99045177369700c60d074c0e525e8093b0fc upstream.
    
    Jan points out that I forgot to make the needed fixes to the
    lz4_uncompress_unknownoutputsize() function to mirror the changes done
    in lz4_decompress() with regards to potential pointer overflows.
    
    The only in-kernel user of this function is the zram code, which only
    takes data from a valid compressed buffer that it made itself, so it's
    not a big issue.  But due to external kernel modules using this
    function, it's better to be safe here.

    ptrace,x86: force IRET path after a ptrace_stop()
    
    commit b9cd18de4db3c9ffa7e17b0dc0ca99ed5aa4d43a upstream.
    
    The 'sysret' fastpath does not correctly restore even all regular
    registers, much less any segment registers or reflags values.  That is
    very much part of why it's faster than 'iret'.
    
    Normally that isn't a problem, because the normal ptrace() interface
    catches the process using the signal handler infrastructure, which
    always returns with an iret.
    
    However, some paths can get caught using ptrace_event() instead of the
    signal path, and for those we need to make sure that we aren't going to
    return to user space using 'sysret'.  Otherwise the modifications that
    may have been done to the register set by the tracer wouldn't
    necessarily take effect.
    
    Fix it by forcing IRET path by setting TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME from
    arch_ptrace_stop_needed() which is invoked from ptrace_stop().

    MIPS: KVM: Fix memory leak on VCPU
    
    commit 8c9eb041cf76038eb3b62ee259607eec9b89f48d upstream.
    
    kvm_arch_vcpu_free() is called in 2 code paths:
    
    1) kvm_vm_ioctl()
           kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu()
               kvm_arch_vcpu_destroy()
                   kvm_arch_vcpu_free()
    2) kvm_put_kvm()
           kvm_destroy_vm()
               kvm_arch_destroy_vm()
                   kvm_mips_free_vcpus()
                       kvm_arch_vcpu_free()
    
    Neither of the paths handles VCPU free. We need to do it in
    kvm_arch_vcpu_free() corresponding to the memory allocation in
    kvm_arch_vcpu_create().

    reiserfs: call truncate_setsize under tailpack mutex
    
    commit 22e7478ddbcb670e33fab72d0bbe7c394c3a2c84 upstream.
    
    Prior to commit 0e4f6a791b1e (Fix reiserfs_file_release()), reiserfs
    truncates serialized on i_mutex. They mostly still do, with the exception
    of reiserfs_file_release. That blocks out other writers via the tailpack
    mutex and the inode openers counter adjusted in reiserfs_file_open.
    
    However, NFS will call reiserfs_setattr without having called ->open, so
    we end up with a race when nfs is calling ->setattr while another
    process is releasing the file. Ultimately, it triggers the
    BUG_ON(inode->i_size != new_file_size) check in maybe_indirect_to_direct.
    
    The solution is to pull the lock into reiserfs_setattr to encompass the
    truncate_setsize call as well.

    xfs: xfs_readsb needs to check for magic numbers
    
    commit 556b8883cfac3d3203557e161ea8005f8b5479b2 upstream.
    
    Commit daba542 ("xfs: skip verification on initial "guess"
    superblock read") dropped the use of a verifier for the initial
    superblock read so we can probe the sector size of the filesystem
    stored in the superblock. It, however, now fails to validate that
    what was read initially is actually an XFS superblock and hence will
    fail the sector size check and return ENOSYS.
    
    This causes probe-based mounts to fail because it expects XFS to
    return EINVAL when it doesn't recognise the superblock format.

    powerpc/serial: Use saner flags when creating legacy ports

    we were missing UPF_SKIP_TEST for some kind of ISA ports which is
    a problem as quite a few UARTs out there don't support the loopback
    test (such as a lot of BMCs).
    
    Let's pick the set of flags used by the SoC code and generalize it
    which means autoconf, no loopback test, irq maybe shared and fixed
    port.
    
    Sending to stable as the lack of UPF_SKIP_TEST is breaking
    serial on some machines so I want this back into distros

    powerpc/mm: Check paca psize is up to date for huge mappings
    
    commit 09567e7fd44291bfc08accfdd67ad8f467842332 upstream.
    
    We have a bug in our hugepage handling which exhibits as an infinite
    loop of hash faults. If the fault is being taken in the kernel it will
    typically trigger the softlockup detector, or the RCU stall detector.
    
    The bug is as follows:
    
     1. mmap(0xa0000000, ..., MAP_FIXED | MAP_HUGE_TLB | MAP_ANONYMOUS ..)
     2. Slice code converts the slice psize to 16M.
     3. The code on lines 539-540 of slice.c in slice_get_unmapped_area()
        synchronises the mm->context with the paca->context. So the paca slice
        mask is updated to include the 16M slice.
     3. Either:
        * mmap() fails because there are no huge pages available.
        * mmap() succeeds and the mapping is then munmapped.
        In both cases the slice psize remains at 16M in both the paca & mm.
     4. mmap(0xa0000000, ..., MAP_FIXED | MAP_ANONYMOUS ..)
     5. The slice psize is converted back to 64K. Because of the check on line 539
        of slice.c we DO NOT update the paca->context. The paca slice mask is now
        out of sync with the mm slice mask.
     6. User/kernel accesses 0xa0000000.
     7. The SLB miss handler slb_allocate_realmode() **uses the paca slice mask**
        to create an SLB entry and inserts it in the SLB.
    18. With the 16M SLB entry in place the hardware does a hash lookup, no entry
        is found so a data access exception is generated.
    19. The data access handler calls do_page_fault() -> handle_mm_fault().
    10. __handle_mm_fault() creates a THP mapping with do_huge_pmd_anonymous_page().
    11. The hardware retries the access, there is still nothing in the hash table
        so once again a data access exception is generated.
    12. hash_page() calls into __hash_page_thp() and inserts a mapping in the
        hash. Although the THP mapping maps 16M the hashing is done using 64K
        as the segment page size.
    13. hash_page() returns immediately after calling __hash_page_thp(), skipping
        over the code at line 1125. Resulting in the mismatch between the
        paca->context and mm->context not being detected.
    14. The hardware retries the access, the hash it generates using the 16M
        SLB entry does NOT match the hash we inserted.
    15. We take another data access and go into __hash_page_thp().
    16. We see a valid entry in the hpte_slot_array and so we call updatepp()
        which succeeds.
    17. Goto 14.
    
    We could fix this in two ways. The first would be to remove or modify
    the check on line 539 of slice.c.
    
    The second option is to cause the check of paca psize in hash_page() on
    line 1125 to also be done for THP pages.
    
    We prefer the latter, because the check & update of the paca psize is
    not done until we know it's necessary. It's also done only on the
    current cpu, so we don't need to IPI all other cpus.
    
    Without further rearranging the code, the simplest fix is to pull out
    the code that checks paca psize and call it in two places. Firstly for
    THP/hugetlb, and secondly for other mappings as before.
    
    Thanks to Dave Jones for trinity, which originally found this bug.

    nfs: Fix cache_validity check in nfs_write_pageuptodate()
    
    commit 18dd78c427513fb0f89365138be66e6ee8700d1b upstream.
    
    NFS_INO_INVALID_DATA cannot be ignored, even if we have a delegation.
    
    We're still having some problems with data corruption when multiple
    clients are appending to a file and those clients are being granted
    write delegations on open.
    
    To reproduce:
    
    Client A:
    vi /mnt/`hostname -s`
    while :; do echo "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" >>/mnt/file; sleep $(( $RANDOM % 5 )); done
    
    Client B:
    vi /mnt/`hostname -s`
    while :; do echo "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYY" >>/mnt/file; sleep $(( $RANDOM % 5 )); done
    
    What's happening is that in nfs_update_inode() we're recognizing that
    the file size has changed and we're setting NFS_INO_INVALID_DATA
    accordingly, but then we ignore the cache_validity flags in
    nfs_write_pageuptodate() because we have a delegation.  As a result,
    in nfs_updatepage() we're extending the write to cover the full page
    even though we've not read in the data to begin with.

    IB/umad: Fix use-after-free on close

    Avoid that closing /dev/infiniband/umad<n> or /dev/infiniband/issm<n>
    triggers a use-after-free.  __fput() invokes f_op->release() before it
    invokes cdev_put().  Make sure that the ib_umad_device structure is
    freed by the cdev_put() call instead of f_op->release().  This avoids
    that changing the port mode from IB into Ethernet and back to IB
    followed by restarting opensmd triggers the following kernel oops:

    IB/umad: Fix error handling
    
    commit 8ec0a0e6b58218bdc1db91dd70ebfcd6ad8dd6cd upstream.
    
    Avoid leaking a kref count in ib_umad_open() if port->ib_dev == NULL
    or if nonseekable_open() fails.
    
    Avoid leaking a kref count, that sm_sem is kept down and also that the
    IB_PORT_SM capability mask is not cleared in ib_umad_sm_open() if
    nonseekable_open() fails.
    
    Since container_of() never returns NULL, remove the code that tests
    whether container_of() returns NULL.
    
    Moving the kref_get() call from the start of ib_umad_*open() to the
    end is safe since it is the responsibility of the caller of these
    functions to ensure that the cdev pointer remains valid until at least
    when these functions return.

    IB/mlx5: add missing padding at end of struct mlx5_ib_create_srq
    
    commit 43bc889380c2ad9aa230eccc03a15cc52cf710d4 upstream.
    
    The i386 ABI disagrees with most other ABIs regarding alignment of
    data type larger than 4 bytes: on most ABIs a padding must be added at
    end of the structures, while it is not required on i386.
    
    So for most ABIs struct mlx5_ib_create_srq gets implicitly padded to be
    aligned on a 8 bytes multiple, while for i386, such padding is not
    added.
    
    Tool pahole could be used to find such implicit padding:
    
      $ pahole --anon_include \
               --nested_anon_include \
               --recursive \
               --class_name mlx5_ib_create_srq \
               drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/mlx5_ib.o
    
    Then, structure layout can be compared between i386 and x86_64:
    
    #  +++ obj-i386/drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/mlx5_ib.o.pahole.txt    2014-03-28 11:43:07.386413682 +0100

    #          __u32                      flags;                /*    16     4 */

    #  +       /* padding: 4 */
    #  +       /* last cacheline: 24 bytes */
    #   };
    
    ABI disagreement will make an x86_64 kernel try to read past
    the buffer provided by an i386 binary.
    
    When boundary check will be implemented, the x86_64 kernel will
    refuse to read past the i386 userspace provided buffer and the
    uverb will fail.

    next page is not mapped, ib_copy_from_udata() will fail and the

    This patch makes create_srq_user() takes care of the input
    data size to handle the case where no padding was provided.
    
    This way, x86_64 kernel will be able to handle struct mlx5_ib_create_srq

    IB/mlx5: add missing padding at end of struct mlx5_ib_create_cq
    
    commit a8237b32a3faab155a5dc8f886452147ce73da3e upstream.
    
    The i386 ABI disagrees with most other ABIs regarding alignment of
    data type larger than 4 bytes: on most ABIs a padding must be added at
    end of the structures, while it is not required on i386.
    
    So for most ABI struct mlx5_ib_create_cq get padded to be aligned on a
    8 bytes multiple, while for i386, such padding is not added.
    
    The tool pahole can be used to find such implicit padding:
    
      $ pahole --anon_include \
             --nested_anon_include \
             --recursive \
             --class_name mlx5_ib_create_cq \
             drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/mlx5_ib.o
    
    Then, structure layout can be compared between i386 and x86_64:

    #   };
    
    This ABI disagreement will make an x86_64 kernel try to read past the
    buffer provided by an i386 binary.
    
    When boundary check will be implemented, a x86_64 kernel will refuse
    to read past the i386 userspace provided buffer and the uverb will
    fail.
    
    Anyway, if the structure lies in memory on a page boundary and next
    page is not mapped, ib_copy_from_udata() will fail when trying to read
    the 4 bytes of padding and the uverb will fail.
    
    This patch makes create_cq_user() takes care of the input data size to
    handle the case where no padding is provided.
    
    This way, x86_64 kernel will be able to handle struct
    mlx5_ib_create_cq as sent by unpatched and patched i386 libmlx5.

    kernel/watchdog.c: remove preemption restrictions when restarting lockup detector
    
    commit bde92cf455a03a91badb7046855592d8c008e929 upstream.
    
    Peter Wu noticed the following splat on his machine when updating
    /proc/sys/kernel/watchdog_thresh:
    
      BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at mm/slub.c:965
      in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, pid: 1, name: init

      NMI watchdog: disabled (cpu0): hardware events not enabled
    
    What happened is after updating the watchdog_thresh, the lockup detector
    is restarted to utilize the new value.  Part of this process involved
    disabling preemption.  Once preemption was disabled, perf tried to
    allocate a new event (as part of the restart).  This caused the above
    BUG_ON as you can't sleep with preemption disabled.
    
    The preemption restriction seemed agressive as we are not doing anything
    on that particular cpu, but with all the online cpus (which are
    protected by the get_online_cpus lock).  Remove the restriction and the
    BUG_ON goes away.

    watchdog: kempld-wdt: Use the correct value when configuring the prescaler with the watchdog
    
    commit a9e0436b303e94ba57d3bd4b1fcbeaa744b7ebeb upstream.
    
    Use the prescaler index, rather than its value, to configure the watchdog.
    This will prevent a mismatch with the prescaler used to calculate the cycles.

    watchdog: ath79_wdt: avoid spurious restarts on AR934x
    
    commit 23afeb613ec0e10aecfae7838a14d485db62ac52 upstream.
    
    On some AR934x based systems, where the frequency of
    the AHB bus is relatively high, the built-in watchdog
    causes a spurious restart when it gets enabled.
    
    The possible cause of these restarts is that the timeout
    value written into the TIMER register does not reaches
    the hardware in time.
    
    Add an explicit delay into the ath79_wdt_enable function
    to avoid the spurious restarts.

    After analyzing the code, I found a condition that may cause this failed
    in correct operations. Thus, I think this assertion is wrong and should be
    removed.
    
    Suppose there are two clean znodes and one dirty znode in TNC. So the
    per-filesystem atomic_t @clean_zn_cnt is (2). If commit start, dirty_znode
    is set to COW_ZNODE in get_znodes_to_commit() in case of potentially ops
    on this znode. We clear COW bit and DIRTY bit in write_index() without
    @tnc_mutex locked. We don't increase @clean_zn_cnt in this place. As the
    comments in write_index() shows, if another process hold @tnc_mutex and
    dirty this znode after we clean it, @clean_zn_cnt would be decreased to (1).
    We will increase @clean_zn_cnt to (2) with @tnc_mutex locked in
    free_obsolete_znodes() to keep it right.
    
    If shrink_tnc() performs between decrease and increase, it will release
    other 2 clean znodes it holds and found @clean_zn_cnt is less than zero
    (1 - 2 = -1), then hit the assertion. Because free_obsolete_znodes() will
    soon correct @clean_zn_cnt and no harm to fs in this case, I think this
    assertion could be removed.
    
    2 clean zondes and 1 dirty znode, @clean_zn_cnt == 2

       -> set_page_dirty
           -> ubifs_set_page_dirty
               -> TestSetPageDirty (set page dirty without budgeting)
       -> unlock_page
    
    This leads to situation where we have a diry page but no budget allocated for
    this page, so further write-back may fail with -ENOSPC.
    
    In this fix we return from page_mkwrite without performing unlock_page. We
    return VM_FAULT_LOCKED instead. After doing this, the race above will not
    happen.

    MIPS: MSC: Prevent out-of-bounds writes to MIPS SC ioremap'd region
    
    commit ab6c15bc6620ebe220970cc040b29bcb2757f373 upstream.
    
    Previously, the lower limit for the MIPS SC initialization loop was
    set incorrectly allowing one extra loop leading to writes
    beyond the MSC ioremap'd space. More precisely, the value of the 'imp'
    in the last loop increased beyond the msc_irqmap_t boundaries and
    as a result of which, the 'n' variable was loaded with an incorrect
    value. This value was used later on to calculate the offset in the
    MSC01_IC_SUP which led to random crashes like the following one:
    
    CPU 0 Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address e75c0200,
    epc == 8058dba4, ra == 8058db90

    recordmcount/MIPS: Fix possible incorrect mcount_loc table entries in modules
    
    commit 91ad11d7cc6f4472ebf177a6252fbf0fd100d798 upstream.
    
    On MIPS calls to _mcount in modules generate 2 instructions to load
    the _mcount address (and therefore 2 relocations). The mcount_loc
    table should only reference the first of these, so the second is
    filtered out by checking the relocation offset and ignoring ones that
    immediately follow the previous one seen.
    
    However if a module has an _mcount call at offset 0, the second
    relocation would not be filtered out due to old_r_offset == 0
    being taken to mean that the current relocation is the first one
    seen, and both would end up in the mcount_loc table.
    
    This results in ftrace_make_nop() patching both (adjacent)
    instructions to branches over the _mcount call sequence like so:
    
      0xffffffffc08a8000:  04 00 00 10     b       0xffffffffc08a8014
      0xffffffffc08a8004:  04 00 00 10     b       0xffffffffc08a8018
      0xffffffffc08a8008:  2d 08 e0 03     move    at,ra
      ...
    
    The second branch is in the delay slot of the first, which is
    defined to be unpredictable - on the platform on which this bug was
    encountered, it triggers a reserved instruction exception.
    
    Fix by initializing old_r_offset to ~0 and using that instead of 0
    to determine whether the current relocation is the first seen.

    In module exit, dfs_parent and it's subtree were removed before
    unregistering with pci. When debugfs entry for each device is attempted
    to remove in pci_remove() context, they don't exist, as dfs_parent and
    its children were already ripped apart.

    PCI: Add new ID for Intel GPU "spurious interrupt" quirk
    
    commit 7c82126a94e69bbbac586f0249e7ef11e681246c upstream.
    
    After a CPU upgrade while keeping the same mainboard, we faced "spurious
    interrupt" problems again.
    
    It turned out that the new CPU also featured a new GPU with a different PCI
    ID.
    
    Add this PCI ID to the quirk table.  Probably all other Intel GPU PCI IDs
    are affected, too, but I don't want to add them without a test system.
    
    See f67fd55fa96f ("PCI: Add quirk for still enabled interrupts on Intel
    Sandy Bridge GPUs") for some history.

    Input: elantech - don't set bit 1 of reg_10 when the no_hw_res quirk is set
    
    commit fb4f8f568a9def02240ef9bf7aabd246dc63a081 upstream.
    
    The touchpad on the GIGABYTE U2442 not only stops communicating when we try
    to set bit 3 (enable real hardware resolution) of reg_10, but on some BIOS
    versions also when we set bit 1 (enable two finger mode auto correct).
    
    I've asked the original reporter of:
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61151
    
    To check that not setting bit 1 does not lead to any adverse effects on his
    model / BIOS revision, and it does not, so this commit fixes the touchpad
    not working on these versions by simply never setting bit 1 for laptop
    models with the no_hw_res quirk.

    Input: elantech - deal with clickpads reporting right button events
    
    commit cd9e83e2754465856097f31c7ab933ce74c473f8 upstream.
    
    At least the Dell Vostro 5470 elantech *clickpad* reports right button
    clicks when clicked in the right bottom area:
    
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1103528
    
    This is different from how (elantech) clickpads normally operate, normally
    no matter where the user clicks on the pad the pad always reports a left
    button event, since there is only 1 hardware button beneath the path.
    
    It looks like Dell has put 2 buttons under the pad, one under each bottom
    corner, causing this.
    
    Since this however still clearly is a real clickpad hardware-wise, we still
    want to report it as such to userspace, so that things like finger movement
    in the bottom area can be properly ignored as it should be on clickpads.
    
    So deal with this weirdness by simply mapping a right click to a left click
    on elantech clickpads. As an added advantage this is something which we can
    simply do on all elantech clickpads, so no need to add special quirks for
    this weird model.

    Input: synaptics - fix resolution for manually provided min/max
    
    commit d49cb7aeebb974713f9f7ab2991352d3050b095b upstream.
    
    commit 421e08c41fda fixed the reported min/max for the X and Y axis,
    but unfortunately, it broke the resolution of those same axis.
    
    On the t540p, the resolution is the same regarding X and Y. It is not
    a problem for xf86-input-synaptics because this driver is only interested
    in the ratio between X and Y.
    Unfortunately, xf86-input-cmt uses directly the resolution, and having a
    null resolution leads to some divide by 0 errors, which are translated by
    -infinity in the resulting coordinates.

    iscsi-target: fix iscsit_del_np deadlock on unload
    
    commit 81a9c5e72bdf7109a65102ca61d8cbd722cf4021 upstream.
    
    On uniprocessor preemptible kernel, target core deadlocks on unload. The
    following events happen:
    * iscsit_del_np is called
    * it calls send_sig(SIGINT, np->np_thread, 1);
    * the scheduler switches to the np_thread
    * the np_thread is woken up, it sees that kthread_should_stop() returns
      false, so it doesn't terminate
    * the np_thread clears signals with flush_signals(current); and goes back
      to sleep in iscsit_accept_np
    * the scheduler switches back to iscsit_del_np
    * iscsit_del_np calls kthread_stop(np->np_thread);
    * the np_thread is waiting in iscsit_accept_np and it doesn't respond to
      kthread_stop
    
    The deadlock could be resolved if the administrator sends SIGINT signal to
    the np_thread with killall -INT iscsi_np
    
    The reproducible deadlock was introduced in commit
    db6077fd0b7dd41dc6ff18329cec979379071f87, but the thread-stopping code was
    racy even before.
    
    This patch fixes the problem. Using kthread_should_stop to stop the
    np_thread is unreliable, so we test np_thread_state instead. If
    np_thread_state equals ISCSI_NP_THREAD_SHUTDOWN, the thread exits.

    commit 97c99b47ac58bacb7c09e1f47d5d184434f6b06a upstream.
    
    This patch changes iscsit_check_dataout_hdr() to dump the incoming

    ITT descriptor.
    
    This addresses a bug where an initiator sending an Data-Out for

    for the READ, eventually resulting in list corruption.
