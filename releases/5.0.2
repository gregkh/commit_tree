    perf/x86/intel: Implement support for TSX Force Abort
    
    Skylake (and later) will receive a microcode update to address a TSX
    errata. This microcode will, on execution of a TSX instruction
    (speculative or not) use (clobber) PMC3. This update will also provide
    a new MSR to change this behaviour along with a CPUID bit to enumerate
    the presence of this new MSR.
    
    When the MSR gets set; the microcode will no longer use PMC3 but will
    Force Abort every TSX transaction (upon executing COMMIT).
    
    When TSX Force Abort (TFA) is allowed (default); the MSR gets set when
    PMC3 gets scheduled and cleared when, after scheduling, PMC3 is
    unused.
    
    When TFA is not allowed; clear PMC3 from all constraints such that it
    will not get used.

    x86: Add TSX Force Abort CPUID/MSR
    
    Skylake systems will receive a microcode update to address a TSX
    errata. This microcode will (by default) clobber PMC3 when TSX
    instructions are (speculatively or not) executed.
    
    It also provides an MSR to cause all TSX transaction to abort and
    preserve PMC3.
    
    Add the CPUID enumeration and MSR definition.

    ath9k: Avoid OF no-EEPROM quirks without qca,no-eeprom
    
    commit ce938231bd3b1d7af3cbd8836f084801090470e1 upstream.
    
    ath9k_of_init() function[0] was initially written on the assumption that
    if someone had an explicit ath9k OF node that "there must be something
    wrong, why would someone add an OF node if everything is fine"[1]
    (Quoting Martin Blumenstingl <martin.blumenstingl@googlemail.com>)
    
    "it turns out it's not that simple. with your requirements I'm now aware
    of two use-cases where the current code in ath9k_of_init() doesn't work
    without modifications"[1]
    
    The "your requirements" Martin speaks of is the result of the fact that I
    have a device (PowerCloud Systems CR5000) has some kind of default - not
    unique mac address - set and requires to set the correct MAC address via
    mac-address devicetree property, however:
    
    "some cards come with a physical EEPROM chip [or OTP] so "qca,no-eeprom"
    should not be set (your use-case). in this case AH_USE_EEPROM should be
    set (which is the default when there is no OF node)"[1]
    
    The other use case is:
    
    the firmware on some PowerMac G5 seems to add a OF node for the ath9k
    card automatically. depending on the EEPROM on the card AH_NO_EEP_SWAP
    should be unset (which is the default when there is no OF node). see [3]
    
    After this patch to ath9k_of_init() the new behavior will be:
    
        if there's no OF node then everything is the same as before
        if there's an empty OF node then ath9k will use the hardware EEPROM
          (before ath9k would fail to initialize because no EEPROM data was
          provided by userspace)
        if there's an OF node with only a MAC address then ath9k will use
          the MAC address and the hardware EEPROM (see the case above)
        with "qca,no-eeprom" EEPROM data from userspace will be requested.
          the behavior here will not change
    [1]
    
    Martin provides additional background on EEPROM swapping[1].
    
    Thanks to Christian Lamparter <chunkeey@gmail.com> for all his help on
    troubleshooting this issue and the basis for this patch.

    scripts/gdb: replace flags (MS_xyz -> SB_xyz)
    
    commit 663cb6340c6e84fe29aa6d0fa63d85ea6bd6cd19 upstream.
    
    Since commit 1751e8a6cb93 ("Rename superblock flags (MS_xyz ->
    SB_xyz)"), scripts/gdb should be updated to replace MS_xyz with SB_xyz.
    
    This change didn't directly affect the running operation of scripts/gdb
    until commit e262e32d6bde "vfs: Suppress MS_* flag defs within the
    kernel unless explicitly enabled" removed the definitions used by
    constants.py.
    
    Update constants.py.in to utilise the new internal flags, matching the
    implementation at fs/proc_namespace.c::show_sb_opts.
    
    Note to stable, e262e32d6bde landed in v5.0-rc1 (which was just
    released), so we'll want this picked back to 5.0 stable once this patch
    hits mainline (akpm just picked it up).  Without this, debugging a
    kernel a kernel via GDB+QEMU is broken in the 5.0 release.

    staging: erofs: compressed_pages should not be accessed again after freed
    
    commit af692e117cb8cd9d3d844d413095775abc1217f9 upstream.
    
    This patch resolves the following page use-after-free issue,
    z_erofs_vle_unzip:
        ...
        for (i = 0; i < nr_pages; ++i) {
            ...
            z_erofs_onlinepage_endio(page);  (1)
        }
    
        for (i = 0; i < clusterpages; ++i) {
            page = compressed_pages[i];
    
            if (page->mapping == mngda)      (2)
                continue;
            /* recycle all individual staging pages */
            (void)z_erofs_gather_if_stagingpage(page_pool, page); (3)
            WRITE_ONCE(compressed_pages[i], NULL);
        }
        ...
    
    After (1) is executed, page is freed and could be then reused, if
    compressed_pages is scanned after that, it could fall info (2) or
    (3) by mistake and that could finally be in a mess.
    
    This patch aims to solve the above issue only with little changes
    as much as possible in order to make the fix backport easier.

    gfs2: Fix missed wakeups in find_insert_glock
    
    commit 605b0487f0bc1ae9963bf52ece0f5c8055186f81 upstream.
    
    Mark Syms has reported seeing tasks that are stuck waiting in
    find_insert_glock.  It turns out that struct lm_lockname contains four padding
    bytes on 64-bit architectures that function glock_waitqueue doesn't skip when
    hashing the glock name.  As a result, we can end up waking up the wrong
    waitqueue, and the waiting tasks may be stuck forever.
    
    Fix that by using ht_parms.key_len instead of sizeof(struct lm_lockname) for
    the key length.

    Heiner reported that the commit in question prevents his network adapter
    from triggering PME and waking up when network cable is plugged.
    
    The commit tried to prevent root port waking up from D3cold immediately but
    looks like disabing root port PME interrupt is not the right way to fix
    that issue so revert it now.  The patch following proposes an alternative
    solution to that issue.

    commit 05f0edadcc5fccdfc0676825b3e70e75dc0a8a84 upstream.
    
    When an rc device is created, we do not know what key codes it will
    support, since a new keymap might be loaded at some later point. So,
    we set all keybit in the input device.
    
    The uevent for the input device includes all the key codes, of which
    there are now 768. This overflows the size of the uevent
    (UEVENT_BUFFER_SIZE) and no event is generated.
    
    Revert for now until we figure out a different solution.
    
    This reverts commit fec225a04330d0f222d24feb5bea045526031675.

    drm: disable uncached DMA optimization for ARM and arm64
    
    [ Upstream commit e02f5c1bb2283cfcee68f2f0feddcc06150f13aa ]
    
    The DRM driver stack is designed to work with cache coherent devices
    only, but permits an optimization to be enabled in some cases, where
    for some buffers, both the CPU and the GPU use uncached mappings,
    removing the need for DMA snooping and allocation in the CPU caches.
    
    The use of uncached GPU mappings relies on the correct implementation
    of the PCIe NoSnoop TLP attribute by the platform, otherwise the GPU
    will use cached mappings nonetheless. On x86 platforms, this does not
    seem to matter, as uncached CPU mappings will snoop the caches in any
    case. However, on ARM and arm64, enabling this optimization on a
    platform where NoSnoop is ignored results in loss of coherency, which
    breaks correct operation of the device. Since we have no way of
    detecting whether NoSnoop works or not, just disable this
    optimization entirely for ARM and arm64.

    ARM: dts: exynos: Fix max voltage for buck8 regulator on Odroid XU3/XU4
    
    commit a3238924a820c1d7c977b632b769f3b5690cba09 upstream.
    
    The maximum voltage value for buck8 regulator on Odroid XU3/XU4 boards is
    set too low. Increase it to the 2000mV as specified on the board schematic.
    So far the board worked fine, because of the bug in the PMIC driver, which
    used incorrect step value for that regulator. It interpreted the voltage
    value set by the bootloader as 1225mV and kept it unchanged. The regulator
    driver has been however fixed recently in the commit 56b5d4ea778c
    ("regulator: s2mps11: Fix steps for buck7, buck8 and LDO35"), what results
    in reading the proper buck8 value and forcing it to 1500mV on boot. This
    is not enough for proper board operation and results in eMMC errors during
    heavy IO traffic. Increasing maximum voltage value for buck8 restores
    original driver behavior and fixes eMMC issues.

    ARM: dts: exynos: Fix pinctrl definition for eMMC RTSN line on Odroid X2/U3
    
    commit ec33745bccc8f336957c751f4153421cc9ef5a54 upstream.
    
    Commit 225da7e65a03 ("ARM: dts: add eMMC reset line for
    exynos4412-odroid-common") added MMC power sequence for eMMC card of
    Odroid X2/U3. It reused generic sd1_cd pin control configuration node
    and only disabled pull-up. However that time the pinctrl configuration
    was not applied during MMC power sequence driver initialization. This
    has been changed later by commit d97a1e5d7cd2 ("mmc: pwrseq: convert to
    proper platform device").
    
    It turned out then, that the provided pinctrl configuration is not
    correct, because the eMMC_RTSN line is being re-configured as 'special
    function/card detect function for mmc1 controller' not the simple
    'output', thus the power sequence driver doesn't really set the pin
    value. This in effect broke the reboot of Odroid X2/U3 boards. Fix this
    by providing separate node with eMMC_RTSN pin configuration.

    arm64: dts: hikey: Give wifi some time after power-on
    
    commit 83b944174ad79825ae84a47af1a0354485b24602 upstream.
    
    Somewhere along recent changes to power control of the wl1835, power-on
    became very unreliable on the hikey, failing like this:
    
    wl1271_sdio: probe of mmc2:0001:1 failed with error -16
    wl1271_sdio: probe of mmc2:0001:2 failed with error -16
    
    After playing with some dt parameters and comparing to other users of
    this chip, it turned out we need some power-on delay to make things
    stable again. In contrast to those other users which define 200 ms, the
    hikey would already be happy with 1 ms. Still, we use the safer 10 ms,
    like on the Ultra96.

    x86/PCI: Fixup RTIT_BAR of Intel Denverton Trace Hub
    
    commit 2e095ce7b6ecce2f3e2ff330527f12056ed1e1a1 upstream.
    
    On Denverton's integration of the Intel(R) Trace Hub (for a reference and
    overview see Documentation/trace/intel_th.rst) the reported size of one of
    its resources (RTIT_BAR) doesn't match its actual size, which leads to
    overlaps with other devices' resources.
    
    In practice, it overlaps with XHCI MMIO space, which results in the xhci
    driver bailing out after seeing its registers as 0xffffffff, and perceived
    disappearance of all USB devices:
    
      intel_th_pci 0000:00:1f.7: enabling device (0004 -> 0006)
      xhci_hcd 0000:00:15.0: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
      xhci_hcd 0000:00:15.0: xHC not responding in xhci_irq, assume controller is dead
      xhci_hcd 0000:00:15.0: HC died; cleaning up
      usb 1-1: USB disconnect, device number 2
    
    For this reason, we need to resize the RTIT_BAR on Denverton to its actual
    size, which in this case is 4MB.  The corresponding erratum is DNV36 at the
    link below:
    
      DNV36.       Processor Host Root Complex May Incorrectly Route Memory
                   Accesses to Intel® Trace Hub
    
      Problem:     The Intel® Trace Hub RTIT_BAR (B0:D31:F7 offset 20h) is
                   reported as a 2KB memory range.  Due to this erratum, the
                   processor Host Root Complex will forward addresses from
                   RTIT_BAR to RTIT_BAR + 4MB -1 to Intel® Trace Hub.
    
      Implication: Devices assigned within the RTIT_BAR to RTIT_BAR + 4MB -1
                   space may not function correctly.
    
      Workaround:  A BIOS code change has been identified and may be
                   implemented as a workaround for this erratum.
    
      Status:      No Fix.
    
    Note that 5118ccd34780 ("intel_th: pci: Add Denverton SOC support") updates
    the Trace Hub driver so it claims the Denverton device, but the resource
    overlap exists regardless of whether that driver is loaded or that commit
    is included.

    media: uvcvideo: Fix 'type' check leading to overflow
    
    commit 47bb117911b051bbc90764a8bff96543cbd2005f upstream.
    
    When initially testing the Camera Terminal Descriptor wTerminalType
    field (buffer[4]), no mask is used. Later in the function, the MSB is
    overloaded to store the descriptor subtype, and so a mask of 0x7fff
    is used to check the type.
    
    If a descriptor is specially crafted to set this overloaded bit in the
    original wTerminalType field, the initial type check will fail (falling
    through, without adjusting the buffer size), but the later type checks
    will pass, assuming the buffer has been made suitably large, causing an
    overflow.
    
    Avoid this problem by checking for the MSB in the wTerminalType field.
    If the bit is set, assume the descriptor is bad, and abort parsing it.
