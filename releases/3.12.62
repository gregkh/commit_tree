    signal: remove warning about using SI_TKILL in rt_[tg]sigqueueinfo
    
    commit 69828dce7af2cb6d08ef5a03de687d422fb7ec1f upstream.
    
    Sending SI_TKILL from rt_[tg]sigqueueinfo was deprecated, so now we issue
    a warning on the first attempt of doing it.  We use WARN_ON_ONCE, which is
    not informative and, what is worse, taints the kernel, making the trinity
    syscall fuzzer complain false-positively from time to time.
    
    It does not look like we need this warning at all, because the behaviour
    changed quite a long time ago (2.6.39), and if an application relies on
    the old API, it gets EPERM anyway and can issue a warning by itself.
    
    So let us zap the warning in kernel.

    MIPS: KVM: Fix modular KVM under QEMU
    
    commit 797179bc4fe06c89e47a9f36f886f68640b423f8 upstream.
    
    Copy __kvm_mips_vcpu_run() into unmapped memory, so that we can never
    get a TLB refill exception in it when KVM is built as a module.
    
    This was observed to happen with the host MIPS kernel running under
    QEMU, due to a not entirely transparent optimisation in the QEMU TLB
    handling where TLB entries replaced with TLBWR are copied to a separate
    part of the TLB array. Code in those pages continue to be executable,
    but those mappings persist only until the next ASID switch, even if they
    are marked global.
    
    An ASID switch happens in __kvm_mips_vcpu_run() at exception level after
    switching to the guest exception base. Subsequent TLB mapped kernel
    instructions just prior to switching to the guest trigger a TLB refill
    exception, which enters the guest exception handlers without updating
    EPC. This appears as a guest triggered TLB refill on a host kernel
    mapped (host KSeg2) address, which is not handled correctly as user
    (guest) mode accesses to kernel (host) segments always generate address
    error exceptions.

    cdc_ncm: workaround for EM7455 "silent" data interface
    
    [ Upstream commit c086e7096170390594c425114d98172bc9aceb8a ]
    
    Several Lenovo users have reported problems with their Sierra
    Wireless EM7455 modem. The driver has loaded successfully and
    the MBIM management channel has appeared to work, including
    establishing a connection to the mobile network. But no frames
    have been received over the data interface.
    
    The problem affects all EM7455 and MC7455, and is assumed to
    affect other modems based on the same Qualcomm chipset and
    baseband firmware.
    
    Testing narrowed the problem down to what seems to be a
    firmware timing bug during initialization. Adding a short sleep
    while probing is sufficient to make the problem disappear.
    Experiments have shown that 1-2 ms is too little to have any
    effect, while 10-20 ms is enough to reliably succeed.

    commit 6217e5ede23285ddfee10d2e4ba0cc2d4c046205 upstream.
    
    I previously added an integer overflow check here but looking at it now,
    it's still buggy.
    
    The bug happens in snd_compr_allocate_buffer().  We multiply
    ".fragments" and ".fragment_size" and that doesn't overflow but then we
    save it in an unsigned int so it truncates the high bits away and we
    allocate a smaller than expected size.

    mm/swap.c: flush lru pvecs on compound page arrival
    
    commit 8f182270dfec432e93fae14f9208a6b9af01009f upstream.
    
    Currently we can have compound pages held on per cpu pagevecs, which
    leads to a lot of memory unavailable for reclaim when needed.  In the
    systems with hundreads of processors it can be GBs of memory.
    
    On of the way of reproducing the problem is to not call munmap
    explicitly on all mapped regions (i.e.  after receiving SIGTERM).  After
    that some pages (with THP enabled also huge pages) may end up on
    lru_add_pvec, example below.
    
      void main() {
      #pragma omp parallel
      {
            size_t size = 55 * 1000 * 1000; // smaller than  MEM/CPUS
            void *p = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                    MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS , -1, 0);
            if (p != MAP_FAILED)
                    memset(p, 0, size);
            //munmap(p, size); // uncomment to make the problem go away
      }
      }
    
    When we run it with THP enabled it will leave significant amount of
    memory on lru_add_pvec.  This memory will be not reclaimed if we hit
    OOM, so when we run above program in a loop:
    
            for i in `seq 100`; do ./a.out; done
    
    many processes (95% in my case) will be killed by OOM.
    
    The primary point of the LRU add cache is to save the zone lru_lock
    contention with a hope that more pages will belong to the same zone and
    so their addition can be batched.  The huge page is already a form of
    batched addition (it will add 512 worth of memory in one go) so skipping
    the batching seems like a safer option when compared to a potential
    excess in the caching which can be quite large and much harder to fix
    because lru_add_drain_all is way to expensive and it is not really clear
    what would be a good moment to call it.
    
    Similarly we can reproduce the problem on lru_deactivate_pvec by adding:
    madvise(p, size, MADV_FREE); after memset.
    
    This patch flushes lru pvecs on compound page arrival making the problem
    less severe - after applying it kill rate of above example drops to 0%,
    due to reducing maximum amount of memory held on pvec from 28MB (with
    THP) to 56kB per CPU.

    base: make module_create_drivers_dir race-free
    
    commit 7e1b1fc4dabd6ec8e28baa0708866e13fa93c9b3 upstream.
    
    Modules which register drivers via standard path (driver_register) in
    parallel can cause a warning:
    WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 3492 at ../fs/sysfs/dir.c:31 sysfs_warn_dup+0x62/0x80

    Call Trace:

     [<ffffffffa0033011>] hexium_init_module+0x11/0x1000 [hexium_gemini]
    ...
    
    As can be (mostly) seen, driver_register causes this call sequence:
      -> bus_add_driver
        -> module_add_driver
          -> module_create_drivers_dir
    The last one creates "drivers" directory in /sys/module/<...>. When
    this is done in parallel, the directory is attempted to be created
    twice at the same time.
    
    This can be easily reproduced by loading mxb and hexium_gemini in
    parallel:
    while :; do
      modprobe mxb &
      modprobe hexium_gemini
      wait
      rmmod mxb hexium_gemini saa7146_vv saa7146
    done
    
    saa7146 calls pci_register_driver for both mxb and hexium_gemini,
    which means /sys/module/saa7146/drivers is to be created for both of
    them.
    
    Fix this by a new mutex in module_create_drivers_dir which makes the
    test-and-create "drivers" dir atomic.
    
    I inverted the condition and removed 'return' to avoid multiple
    unlocks or a goto.

    KEYS: potential uninitialized variable
    
    commit 38327424b40bcebe2de92d07312c89360ac9229a upstream.
    
    If __key_link_begin() failed then "edit" would be uninitialized.  I've
    added a check to fix that.
    
    This allows a random user to crash the kernel, though it's quite
    difficult to achieve.  There are three ways it can be done as the user
    would have to cause an error to occur in __key_link():
    
     (1) Cause the kernel to run out of memory.  In practice, this is difficult
         to achieve without ENOMEM cropping up elsewhere and aborting the
         attempt.
    
     (2) Revoke the destination keyring between the keyring ID being looked up
         and it being tested for revocation.  In practice, this is difficult to
         time correctly because the KEYCTL_REJECT function can only be used
         from the request-key upcall process.  Further, users can only make use
         of what's in /sbin/request-key.conf, though this does including a
         rejection debugging test - which means that the destination keyring
         has to be the caller's session keyring in practice.
    
     (3) Have just enough key quota available to create a key, a new session
         keyring for the upcall and a link in the session keyring, but not then
         sufficient quota to create a link in the nominated destination keyring
         so that it fails with EDQUOT.
    
    The bug can be triggered using option (3) above using something like the
    following:
    
            echo 80 >/proc/sys/kernel/keys/root_maxbytes
            keyctl request2 user debug:fred negate @t
    
    The above sets the quota to something much lower (80) to make the bug
    easier to trigger, but this is dependent on the system.  Note also that
    the name of the keyring created contains a random number that may be
    between 1 and 10 characters in size, so may throw the test off by
    changing the amount of quota used.
    
    Assuming the failure occurs, something like the following will be seen:
    
            kfree_debugcheck: out of range ptr 6b6b6b6b6b6b6b68h

    SCSI: Increase REPORT_LUNS timeout
    
    commit b39c9a661b9bc77e064cade26cf913a1d4255d55 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an issue seen with an IBM 2145 (SVC) where, following an error
    injection test which results in paths going offline, when they came
    back online, the path would timeout the REPORT_LUNS issued during the
    scan. This timeout situation continued until retries were expired, resulting in
    falling back to a sequential LUN scan. Then, since the target responds
    with PQ=1, PDT=0 for all possible LUNs, due to the way the sequential
    LUN scan code works, we end up adding 512 LUNs for each target, when there
    is really only a small handful of LUNs that are actually present.
    
    This patch increases the timeout used on the REPORT_LUNS to 30 seconds.
    This patch solves the issue of 512 non existent LUNs showing up after
    this event.

    net/qlge: Avoids recursive EEH error
    
    commit 3275c0c6c522ab04afa14f80efdac6213c3883d6 upstream.
    
    One timer, whose handler keeps reading on MMIO register for EEH
    core to detect error in time, is started when the PCI device driver
    is loaded. MMIO register can't be accessed during PE reset in EEH
    recovery. Otherwise, the unexpected recursive error is triggered.
    The timer isn't closed that time if the interface isn't brought
    up. So the unexpected recursive error is seen during EEH recovery
    when the interface is down.
    
    This avoids the unexpected recursive EEH error by closing the timer
    in qlge_io_error_detected() before EEH PE reset unconditionally. The
    timer is started unconditionally after EEH PE reset in qlge_io_resume().
    Also, the timer should be closed unconditionally when the device is
    removed from the system permanently in qlge_io_error_detected().

    ALSA: hrtimer: Handle start/stop more properly
    
    commit d2c5cf88d5282de258f4eb6ab40040b80a075cd8 upstream.
    
    This patch tries to address the still remaining issues in ALSA hrtimer
    driver:
    - Spurious use-after-free was detected in hrtimer callback
    - Incorrect rescheduling due to delayed start
    - WARN_ON() is triggered in hrtimer_forward() invoked in hrtimer
      callback
    
    The first issue happens only when the new timer is scheduled even
    while hrtimer is being closed.  It's related with the second and third
    items; since ALSA timer core invokes hw.start callback during hrtimer
    interrupt, this may result in the explicit call of hrtimer_start().
    
    Also, the similar problem is seen for the stop; ALSA timer core
    invokes hw.stop callback even in the hrtimer handler, too.  Since we
    must not call the synced hrtimer_cancel() in such a context, it's just
    a hrtimer_try_to_cancel() call that doesn't properly work.
    
    Another culprit of the second and third items is the call of
    hrtimer_forward_now() before snd_timer_interrupt().  The timer->stick
    value may change during snd_timer_interrupt() call, but this
    possibility is ignored completely.
    
    For covering these subtle and messy issues, the following changes have
    been done in this patch:
    - A new flag, in_callback, is introduced in the private data to
      indicate that the hrtimer handler is being processed.
    - Both start and stop callbacks skip when called from (during)
      in_callback flag.
    - The hrtimer handler returns properly HRTIMER_RESTART and NORESTART
      depending on the running state now.
    - The hrtimer handler reprograms the expiry properly after
      snd_timer_interrupt() call, instead of before.
    - The close callback clears running flag and sets in_callback flag
      to block any further start/stop calls.

    Bridge: Fix ipv6 mc snooping if bridge has no ipv6 address
    
    [ Upstream commit 0888d5f3c0f183ea6177355752ada433d370ac89 ]
    
    The bridge is falsly dropping ipv6 mulitcast packets if there is:
     1. No ipv6 address assigned on the brigde.
     2. No external mld querier present.
     3. The internal querier enabled.
    
    When the bridge fails to build mld queries, because it has no
    ipv6 address, it slilently returns, but keeps the local querier enabled.
    This specific case causes confusing packet loss.
    
    Ipv6 multicast snooping can only work if:
     a) An external querier is present
     OR
     b) The bridge has an ipv6 address an is capable of sending own queries
    
    Otherwise it has to forward/flood the ipv6 multicast traffic,
    because snooping cannot work.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by adding a flag to the bridge struct that
    indicates that there is currently no ipv6 address assinged to the bridge
    and returns a false state for the local querier in
    __br_multicast_querier_exists().
    
    Special thanks to Linus Lüssing.

    scsi_lib: correctly retry failed zero length REQ_TYPE_FS commands
    
    commit a621bac3044ed6f7ec5fa0326491b2d4838bfa93 upstream.
    
    When SCSI was written, all commands coming from the filesystem
    (REQ_TYPE_FS commands) had data.  This meant that our signal for needing
    to complete the command was the number of bytes completed being equal to
    the number of bytes in the request.  Unfortunately, with the advent of
    flush barriers, we can now get zero length REQ_TYPE_FS commands, which
    confuse this logic because they satisfy the condition every time.  This
    means they never get retried even for retryable conditions, like UNIT
    ATTENTION because we complete them early assuming they're done.  Fix
    this by special casing the early completion condition to recognise zero
    length commands with errors and let them drop through to the retry code.

    UBIFS is using PagePrivate() which can have different meanings across
    filesystems. Therefore the generic page migration code cannot handle this
    case correctly.
    We have to implement our own migration function which basically does a
    plain copy but also duplicates the page private flag.
    UBIFS is not a block device filesystem and cannot use buffer_migrate_page().

    ARM: 8578/1: mm: ensure pmd_present only checks the valid bit
    
    commit 624531886987f0f1b5d01fb598034d039198e090 upstream.
    
    In a subsequent patch, pmd_mknotpresent will clear the valid bit of the
    pmd entry, resulting in a not-present entry from the hardware's
    perspective. Unfortunately, pmd_present simply checks for a non-zero pmd
    value and will therefore continue to return true even after a
    pmd_mknotpresent operation. Since pmd_mknotpresent is only used for
    managing huge entries, this is only an issue for the 3-level case.
    
    This patch fixes the 3-level pmd_present implementation to take into
    account the valid bit. For bisectability, the change is made before the
    fix to pmd_mknotpresent.

    NFS: Fix another OPEN_DOWNGRADE bug
    
    commit e547f2628327fec6afd2e03b46f113f614cca05b upstream.
    
    Olga Kornievskaia reports that the following test fails to trigger
    an OPEN_DOWNGRADE on the wire, and only triggers the final CLOSE.
    
            fd0 = open(foo, RDRW)   -- should be open on the wire for "both"
            fd1 = open(foo, RDONLY)  -- should be open on the wire for "read"
            close(fd0) -- should trigger an open_downgrade
            read(fd1)
            close(fd1)
    
    The issue is that we're missing a check for whether or not the current
    state transitioned from an O_RDWR state as opposed to having transitioned
    from a combination of O_RDONLY and O_WRONLY.

    unconditional d_drop() after the ->open_context() had been removed.  It had
    been correct for success cases (there ->open_context() itself had been doing
    dcache manipulations), but not for error ones.  Only one of those (ENOENT)
    got a compensatory d_drop() added in that commit, but in fact it should've
    been done for all errors.  As it is, the case of O_CREAT non-exclusive open
    on a hashed negative dentry racing with e.g. symlink creation from another
    client ended up with ->open_context() getting an error and proceeding to
    call nfs_lookup().  On a hashed dentry, which would've instantly triggered
    BUG_ON() in d_materialise_unique() (or, these days, its equivalent in
    d_splice_alias()).

    x86/amd_nb: Fix boot crash on non-AMD systems
    
    commit 1ead852dd88779eda12cb09cc894a03d9abfe1ec upstream.
    
    Fix boot crash that triggers if this driver is built into a kernel and
    run on non-AMD systems.
    
    AMD northbridges users call amd_cache_northbridges() and it returns
    a negative value to signal that we weren't able to cache/detect any
    northbridges on the system.
    
    At least, it should do so as all its callers expect it to do so. But it
    does return a negative value only when kmalloc() fails.
    
    Fix it to return -ENODEV if there are no NBs cached as otherwise, amd_nb
    users like amd64_edac, for example, which relies on it to know whether
    it should load or not, gets loaded on systems like Intel Xeons where it
    shouldn't.

    kprobes/x86: Clear TF bit in fault on single-stepping
    
    commit dcfc47248d3f7d28df6f531e6426b933de94370d upstream.
    
    Fix kprobe_fault_handler() to clear the TF (trap flag) bit of
    the flags register in the case of a fault fixup on single-stepping.
    
    If we put a kprobe on the instruction which caused a
    page fault (e.g. actual mov instructions in copy_user_*),
    that fault happens on the single-stepping buffer. In this
    case, kprobes resets running instance so that the CPU can
    retry execution on the original ip address.
    
    However, current code forgets to reset the TF bit. Since this
    fault happens with TF bit set for enabling single-stepping,
    when it retries, it causes a debug exception and kprobes
    can not handle it because it already reset itself.
    
    On the most of x86-64 platform, it can be easily reproduced
    by using kprobe tracer. E.g.
    
      # cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
      # echo p copy_user_enhanced_fast_string+5 > kprobe_events
      # echo 1 > events/kprobes/enable
    
    And you'll see a kernel panic on do_debug(), since the debug
    trap is not handled by kprobes.
    
    To fix this problem, we just need to clear the TF bit when
    resetting running kprobe.

    USB: EHCI: declare hostpc register as zero-length array
    
    commit 7e8b3dfef16375dbfeb1f36a83eb9f27117c51fd upstream.
    
    The HOSTPC extension registers found in some EHCI implementations form
    a variable-length array, with one element for each port.  Therefore
    the hostpc field in struct ehci_regs should be declared as a
    zero-length array, not a single-element array.
    
    This fixes a problem reported by UBSAN.

    powerpc/pseries: Fix PCI config address for DDW
    
    commit 8a934efe94347eee843aeea65bdec8077a79e259 upstream.
    
    In commit 8445a87f7092 "powerpc/iommu: Remove the dependency on EEH
    struct in DDW mechanism", the PE address was replaced with the PCI
    config address in order to remove dependency on EEH. According to PAPR
    spec, firmware (pHyp or QEMU) should accept "xxBBSSxx" format PCI config
    address, not "xxxxBBSS" provided by the patch. Note that "BB" is PCI bus
    number and "SS" is the combination of slot and function number.
    
    This fixes the PCI address passed to DDW RTAS calls.

    powerpc/iommu: Remove the dependency on EEH struct in DDW mechanism
    
    commit 8445a87f7092bc8336ea1305be9306f26b846d93 upstream.
    
    Commit 39baadbf36ce ("powerpc/eeh: Remove eeh information from pci_dn")
    changed the pci_dn struct by removing its EEH-related members.
    As part of this clean-up, DDW mechanism was modified to read the device
    configuration address from eeh_dev struct.
    
    As a consequence, now if we disable EEH mechanism on kernel command-line
    for example, the DDW mechanism will fail, generating a kernel oops by
    dereferencing a NULL pointer (which turns to be the eeh_dev pointer).
    
    This patch just changes the configuration address calculation on DDW
    functions to a manual calculation based on pci_dn members instead of
    using eeh_dev-based address.
    
    No functional changes were made. This was tested on pSeries, both
    in PHyp and qemu guest.

    When this code was reworked for IBoE support the order of assignments
    for the sl_tclass_flowlabel got flipped around resulting in
    TClass & FlowLabel being permanently set to 0 in the packet headers.

    mac80211: mesh: flush mesh paths unconditionally
    
    commit fe7a7c57629e8dcbc0e297363a9b2366d67a6dc5 upstream.
    
    Currently, the mesh paths associated with a nexthop station are cleaned
    up in the following code path:
    
        __sta_info_destroy_part1
        synchronize_net()
        __sta_info_destroy_part2
         -> cleanup_single_sta
           -> mesh_sta_cleanup
             -> mesh_plink_deactivate
               -> mesh_path_flush_by_nexthop
    
    However, there are a couple of problems here:
    
    1) the paths aren't flushed at all if the MPM is running in userspace
       (e.g. when using wpa_supplicant or authsae)
    
    2) there is no synchronize_rcu between removing the path and readers
       accessing the nexthop, which means the following race is possible:
    
    CPU0                            CPU1
    ~~~~                            ~~~~
                                    sta_info_destroy_part1()
                                    synchronize_net()
    rcu_read_lock()
    mesh_nexthop_resolve()
      mpath = mesh_path_lookup()
                                    [...] -> mesh_path_flush_by_nexthop()
      sta = rcu_dereference(
        mpath->next_hop)
                                    kfree(sta)
      access sta <-- CRASH
    
    Fix both of these by unconditionally flushing paths before destroying
    the sta, and by adding a synchronize_net() after path flush to ensure
    no active readers can still dereference the sta.
    
    Fixes this crash:

    commit f3eec0cf784e0d6c47822ca6b66df3d5812af7e6 upstream.
    
    shared_fifo endpoints would only get a previous tx state cleared
    out, the rx state was only cleared for non shared_fifo endpoints
    Change this so that the rx state is cleared for all endpoints.
    This addresses an issue that resulted in rx packets being dropped

    usb: musb: Stop bulk endpoint while queue is rotated
    
    commit 7b2c17f829545df27a910e8d82e133c21c9a8c9c upstream.
    
    Ensure that the endpoint is stopped by clearing REQPKT before
    clearing DATAERR_NAKTIMEOUT before rotating the queue on the
    dedicated bulk endpoint.
    This addresses an issue where a race could result in the endpoint
    receiving data before it was reprogrammed resulting in a warning
    about such data from musb_rx_reinit before it was thrown away.
    The data thrown away was a valid packet that had been correctly
    ACKed which meant the host and device got out of sync.

    net: alx: Work around the DMA RX overflow issue
    
    [ Upstream commit 881d0327db37ad917a367c77aff1afa1ee41e0a9 ]
    
    Note: This is a verified backported patch for stable 4.4 kernel, and it
    could also be applied to 4.3/4.2/4.1/3.18/3.16
    
    There is a problem with alx devices, that the network link will be
    lost in 1-5 minutes after the device is up.
    
    >From debugging without datasheet, we found the error always
    happen when the DMA RX address is set to 0x....fc0, which is very
    likely to be a HW/silicon problem.
    
    This patch will apply rx skb with 64 bytes longer space, and if the
    allocated skb has a 0x...fc0 address, it will use skb_resever(skb, 64)
    to advance the address, so that the RX overflow can be avoided.

    sit: correct IP protocol used in ipip6_err
    
    [ Upstream commit d5d8760b78d0cfafe292f965f599988138b06a70 ]
    
    Since 32b8a8e59c9c ("sit: add IPv4 over IPv4 support")
    ipip6_err() may be called for packets whose IP protocol is
    IPPROTO_IPIP as well as those whose IP protocol is IPPROTO_IPV6.
    
    In the case of IPPROTO_IPIP packets the correct protocol value is not
    passed to ipv4_update_pmtu() or ipv4_redirect().
    
    This patch resolves this problem by using the IP protocol of the packet
    rather than a hard-coded value. This appears to be consistent
    with the usage of the protocol of a packet by icmp_socket_deliver()
    the caller of ipip6_err().
    
    I was able to exercise the redirect case by using a setup where an ICMP
    redirect was received for the destination of the encapsulated packet.
    However, it appears that although incorrect the protocol field is not used
    in this case and thus no problem manifests.  On inspection it does not
    appear that a problem will manifest in the fragmentation needed/update pmtu
    case either.
    
    In short I believe this is a cosmetic fix. None the less, the use of
    IPPROTO_IPV6 seems wrong and confusing.

    This partially reverts commit 1086bbe97a07 ("netfilter: ensure number of

    Setting rules with ebtables does not work any more with 1086bbe97a07 place.
    
    There is an error message and no rules set in the end.
    
    e.g.
    
    ~# ebtables -t nat -A POSTROUTING --src 12:34:56:78:9a:bc -j DROP

    1. Multiple ebtables programs were executing simultaneously. The ebtables
       userspace tool doesn't by default support multiple ebtables programs
    running
    
    Reverting the ebtables part of 1086bbe97a07 makes this work again.

    netfilter: x_tables: do compat validation via translate_table
    
    commit 09d9686047dbbe1cf4faa558d3ecc4aae2046054 upstream.
    
    This looks like refactoring, but its also a bug fix.
    
    Problem is that the compat path (32bit iptables, 64bit kernel) lacks a few
    sanity tests that are done in the normal path.
    
    For example, we do not check for underflows and the base chain policies.
    
    While its possible to also add such checks to the compat path, its more
    copy&pastry, for instance we cannot reuse check_underflow() helper as
    e->target_offset differs in the compat case.
    
    Other problem is that it makes auditing for validation errors harder; two
    places need to be checked and kept in sync.
    
    At a high level 32 bit compat works like this:
    1- initial pass over blob:
       validate match/entry offsets, bounds checking
       lookup all matches and targets
       do bookkeeping wrt. size delta of 32/64bit structures
       assign match/target.u.kernel pointer (points at kernel
       implementation, needed to access ->compatsize etc.)
    
    2- allocate memory according to the total bookkeeping size to
       contain the translated ruleset
    
    3- second pass over original blob:
       for each entry, copy the 32bit representation to the newly allocated
       memory.  This also does any special match translations (e.g.
       adjust 32bit to 64bit longs, etc).
    
    4- check if ruleset is free of loops (chase all jumps)
    
    5-first pass over translated blob:
       call the checkentry function of all matches and targets.
    
    The alternative implemented by this patch is to drop steps 3&4 from the
    compat process, the translation is changed into an intermediate step
    rather than a full 1:1 translate_table replacement.
    
    In the 2nd pass (step #3), change the 64bit ruleset back to a kernel
    representation, i.e. put() the kernel pointer and restore ->u.user.name .
    
    This gets us a 64bit ruleset that is in the format generated by a 64bit
    iptables userspace -- we can then use translate_table() to get the
    'native' sanity checks.
    
    This has two drawbacks:
    
    1. we re-validate all the match and target entry structure sizes even
    though compat translation is supposed to never generate bogus offsets.
    2. we put and then re-lookup each match and target.
    
    THe upside is that we get all sanity tests and ruleset validations
    provided by the normal path and can remove some duplicated compat code.
    
    iptables-restore time of autogenerated ruleset with 300k chains of form
    -A CHAIN0001 -m limit --limit 1/s -j CHAIN0002
    -A CHAIN0002 -m limit --limit 1/s -j CHAIN0003
    
    shows no noticeable differences in restore times:
    old:   0m30.796s
    new:   0m31.521s
    64bit: 0m25.674s

    netfilter: ensure number of counters is >0 in do_replace()
    
    commit 1086bbe97a074844188c6c988fa0b1a98c3ccbb9 upstream.
    
    After improving setsockopt() coverage in trinity, I started triggering
    vmalloc failures pretty reliably from this code path:
    
    warn_alloc_failed+0xe9/0x140
    __vmalloc_node_range+0x1be/0x270
    vzalloc+0x4b/0x50
    __do_replace+0x52/0x260 [ip_tables]
    do_ipt_set_ctl+0x15d/0x1d0 [ip_tables]
    nf_setsockopt+0x65/0x90
    ip_setsockopt+0x61/0xa0
    raw_setsockopt+0x16/0x60
    sock_common_setsockopt+0x14/0x20
    SyS_setsockopt+0x71/0xd0
    
    It turns out we don't validate that the num_counters field in the
    struct we pass in from userspace is initialized.
    
    The same problem also exists in ebtables, arptables, ipv6, and the
    compat variants.

      /proc/net/ip_tables_names was suddenly empty.
      Digging through the registration process, it seems we're catching on the:
    
       if (strcmp(t->u.user.name, XT_STANDARD_TARGET) == 0 &&
           target_offset + sizeof(struct xt_standard_target) != next_offset)
             return -EINVAL;
    
      Where next_offset seems to be 4 bytes larger then the
      offset + standard_target struct size.
    
    next_offset needs to be aligned via XT_ALIGN (so we can access all members
    of ip(6)t_entry struct).
    
    This problem didn't show up on i686 as it only needs 4-byte alignment for
    u64, but iptables userspace on other 32bit arches does insert extra padding.

    netfilter: x_tables: validate all offsets and sizes in a rule
    
    commit 13631bfc604161a9d69cd68991dff8603edd66f9 upstream.
    
    Validate that all matches (if any) add up to the beginning of
    the target and that each match covers at least the base structure size.
    
    The compat path should be able to safely re-use the function
    as the structures only differ in alignment; added a
    BUILD_BUG_ON just in case we have an arch that adds padding as well.

    netfilter: x_tables: check for bogus target offset
    
    commit ce683e5f9d045e5d67d1312a42b359cb2ab2a13c upstream.
    
    We're currently asserting that targetoff + targetsize <= nextoff.
    
    Extend it to also check that targetoff is >= sizeof(xt_entry).
    Since this is generic code, add an argument pointing to the start of the
    match/target, we can then derive the base structure size from the delta.
    
    We also need the e->elems pointer in a followup change to validate matches.

    netfilter: x_tables: check standard target size too
    
    commit 7ed2abddd20cf8f6bd27f65bd218f26fa5bf7f44 upstream.
    
    We have targets and standard targets -- the latter carries a verdict.
    
    The ip/ip6tables validation functions will access t->verdict for the
    standard targets to fetch the jump offset or verdict for chainloop
    detection, but this happens before the targets get checked/validated.
    
    Thus we also need to check for verdict presence here, else t->verdict
    can point right after a blob.
    
    Spotted with UBSAN while testing malformed blobs.

    netfilter: x_tables: don't move to non-existent next rule
    
    commit f24e230d257af1ad7476c6e81a8dc3127a74204e upstream.
    
    Ben Hawkes says:
    
     In the mark_source_chains function (net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c) it
     is possible for a user-supplied ipt_entry structure to have a large
     next_offset field. This field is not bounds checked prior to writing a
     counter value at the supplied offset.
    
    Base chains enforce absolute verdict.
    
    User defined chains are supposed to end with an unconditional return,
    xtables userspace adds them automatically.
    
    But if such return is missing we will move to non-existent next rule.

    fix d_walk()/non-delayed __d_free() race
    
    commit 3d56c25e3bb0726a5c5e16fc2d9e38f8ed763085 upstream.
    
    Ascend-to-parent logics in d_walk() depends on all encountered child
    dentries not getting freed without an RCU delay.  Unfortunately, in
    quite a few cases it is not true, with hard-to-hit oopsable race as
    the result.
    
    Fortunately, the fix is simiple; right now the rule is "if it ever
    been hashed, freeing must be delayed" and changing it to "if it
    ever had a parent, freeing must be delayed" closes that hole and
    covers all cases the old rule used to cover.  Moreover, pipes and
    sockets remain _not_ covered, so we do not introduce RCU delay in
    the cases which are the reason for having that delay conditional
    in the first place.

    wext: Fix 32 bit iwpriv compatibility issue with 64 bit Kernel
    
    commit 3d5fdff46c4b2b9534fa2f9fc78e90a48e0ff724 upstream.
    
    iwpriv app uses iw_point structure to send data to Kernel. The iw_point
    structure holds a pointer. For compatibility Kernel converts the pointer
    as required for WEXT IOCTLs (SIOCIWFIRST to SIOCIWLAST). Some drivers
    may use iw_handler_def.private_args to populate iwpriv commands instead
    of iw_handler_def.private. For those case, the IOCTLs from
    SIOCIWFIRSTPRIV to SIOCIWLASTPRIV will follow the path ndo_do_ioctl().
    Accordingly when the filled up iw_point structure comes from 32 bit
    iwpriv to 64 bit Kernel, Kernel will not convert the pointer and sends
    it to driver. So, the driver may get the invalid data.
    
    The pointer conversion for the IOCTLs (SIOCIWFIRSTPRIV to
    SIOCIWLASTPRIV), which follow the path ndo_do_ioctl(), is mandatory.
    This patch adds pointer conversion from 32 bit to 64 bit and vice versa,
    if the ioctl comes from 32 bit iwpriv to 64 bit Kernel.

    This means the userspace program clock_adjtime called the clock_adjtime()
    syscall and then crashed inside the compat_get_timex() function.
    Syscalls should never crash programs, but instead return EFAULT.
    
    The IIR register contains the executed instruction, which disassebles
    into "ldw 0(sr3,r5),r9".
    This load-word instruction is part of __get_user() which tried to read the word
    at %r5/IOR (0xfa6f7fff). This means the unaligned handler jumped in.  The
    unaligned handler is able to emulate all ldw instructions, but it fails if it
    fails to read the source e.g. because of page fault.
    
    The following program reproduces the problem:
    
    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <sys/syscall.h>
    #include <sys/mman.h>
    
    int main(void) {
            /* allocate 8k */
            char *ptr = mmap(NULL, 2*4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
            /* free second half (upper 4k) and make it invalid. */
            munmap(ptr+4096, 4096);
            /* syscall where first int is unaligned and clobbers into invalid memory region */
            /* syscall should return EFAULT */
            return syscall(__NR_clock_adjtime, 0, ptr+4095);
    }
    
    To fix this issue we simply need to check if the faulting instruction address
    is in the exception fixup table when the unaligned handler failed. If it
    is, call the fixup routine instead of crashing.
    
    While looking at the unaligned handler I found another issue as well: The
    target register should not be modified if the handler was unsuccessful.

    powerpc: Fix definition of SIAR and SDAR registers
    
    commit d23fac2b27d94aeb7b65536a50d32bfdc21fe01e upstream.
    
    The SIAR and SDAR registers are available twice, one time as SPRs
    780 / 781 (unprivileged, but read-only), and one time as the SPRs
    796 / 797 (privileged, but read and write). The Linux kernel code
    currently uses the unprivileged  SPRs - while this is OK for reading,
    writing to that register of course does not work.
    Since the KVM code tries to write to this register, too (see the mtspr
    in book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S), the contents of this register sometimes get
    lost for the guests, e.g. during migration of a VM.
    To fix this issue, simply switch to the privileged SPR numbers instead.

    ARM: fix PTRACE_SETVFPREGS on SMP systems
    
    commit e2dfb4b880146bfd4b6aa8e138c0205407cebbaf upstream.
    
    PTRACE_SETVFPREGS fails to properly mark the VFP register set to be
    reloaded, because it undoes one of the effects of vfp_flush_hwstate().
    
    Specifically vfp_flush_hwstate() sets thread->vfpstate.hard.cpu to
    an invalid CPU number, but vfp_set() overwrites this with the original
    CPU number, thereby rendering the hardware state as apparently "valid",
    even though the software state is more recent.
    
    Fix this by reverting the previous change.

    KVM: x86: fix OOPS after invalid KVM_SET_DEBUGREGS
    
    commit d14bdb553f9196169f003058ae1cdabe514470e6 upstream.
    
    MOV to DR6 or DR7 causes a #GP if an attempt is made to write a 1 to
    any of bits 63:32.  However, this is not detected at KVM_SET_DEBUGREGS
    time, and the next KVM_RUN oopses:

    commit cb0eefcc3271ea1d370476dd29685918b99c5a9f upstream.
    
    The I2C core always reports the MODALIAS uevent as "i2c:<client name"
    regardless if the driver was matched using the I2C id_table or the
    of_match_table. So the driver needs to export the I2C table and this
    be built into the module or udev won't have the necessary information
    to auto load the correct module when the device is added.

    ipv6: Skip XFRM lookup if dst_entry in socket cache is valid
    
    [ Upstream commit 00bc0ef5880dc7b82f9c320dead4afaad48e47be ]
    
    At present we perform an xfrm_lookup() for each UDPv6 message we
    send. The lookup involves querying the flow cache (flow_cache_lookup)
    and, in case of a cache miss, creating an XFRM bundle.
    
    If we miss the flow cache, we can end up creating a new bundle and
    deriving the path MTU (xfrm_init_pmtu) from on an already transformed
    dst_entry, which we pass from the socket cache (sk->sk_dst_cache) down
    to xfrm_lookup(). This can happen only if we're caching the dst_entry
    in the socket, that is when we're using a connected UDP socket.
    
    To put it another way, the path MTU shrinks each time we miss the flow
    cache, which later on leads to incorrectly fragmented payload. It can
    be observed with ESPv6 in transport mode:
    
      1) Set up a transformation and lower the MTU to trigger fragmentation
        # ip xfrm policy add dir out src ::1 dst ::1 \
          tmpl src ::1 dst ::1 proto esp spi 1
        # ip xfrm state add src ::1 dst ::1 \
          proto esp spi 1 enc 'aes' 0x0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b
        # ip link set dev lo mtu 1500
    
      2) Monitor the packet flow and set up an UDP sink
        # tcpdump -ni lo -ttt &
        # socat udp6-listen:12345,fork /dev/null &
    
      3) Send a datagram that needs fragmentation with a connected socket
        # perl -e 'print "@" x 1470 | socat - udp6:[::1]:12345
        2016/06/07 18:52:52 socat[724] E read(3, 0x555bb3d5ba00, 8192): Protocol error
        00:00:00.000000 IP6 ::1 > ::1: frag (0|1448) ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x2), length 1448
        00:00:00.000014 IP6 ::1 > ::1: frag (1448|32)
        00:00:00.000050 IP6 ::1 > ::1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x3), length 1272
        (^ ICMPv6 Parameter Problem)
        00:00:00.000022 IP6 ::1 > ::1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x5), length 136
    
      4) Compare it to a non-connected socket
        # perl -e 'print "@" x 1500' | socat - udp6-sendto:[::1]:12345
        00:00:40.535488 IP6 ::1 > ::1: frag (0|1448) ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x6), length 1448
        00:00:00.000010 IP6 ::1 > ::1: frag (1448|64)
    
    What happens in step (3) is:
    
      1) when connecting the socket in __ip6_datagram_connect(), we
         perform an XFRM lookup, miss the flow cache, create an XFRM
         bundle, and cache the destination,
    
      2) afterwards, when sending the datagram, we perform an XFRM lookup,
         again, miss the flow cache (due to mismatch of flowi6_iif and
         flowi6_oif, which is an issue of its own), and recreate an XFRM
         bundle based on the cached (and already transformed) destination.
    
    To prevent the recreation of an XFRM bundle, avoid an XFRM lookup
    altogether whenever we already have a destination entry cached in the
    socket. This prevents the path MTU shrinkage and brings us on par with
    UDPv4.
    
    The fix also benefits connected PINGv6 sockets, another user of
    ip6_sk_dst_lookup_flow(), who also suffer messages being transformed
    twice.

    udp: prevent skbs lingering in tunnel socket queues
    
    [ Upstream commit e5aed006be918af163eb397e45aa5ea6cefd5e01 ]
    
    In case we find a socket with encapsulation enabled we should call
    the encap_recv function even if just a udp header without payload is
    available. The callbacks are responsible for correctly verifying and
    dropping the packets.
    
    Also, in case the header validation fails for geneve and vxlan we
    shouldn't put the skb back into the socket queue, no one will pick
    them up there.  Instead we can simply discard them in the respective
    encap_recv functions.
    
    [js] 3.12 does not have geneve yet.

    netlink: Fix dump skb leak/double free
    
    [ Upstream commit 92964c79b357efd980812c4de5c1fd2ec8bb5520 ]
    
    When we free cb->skb after a dump, we do it after releasing the
    lock.  This means that a new dump could have started in the time
    being and we'll end up freeing their skb instead of ours.
    
    This patch saves the skb and module before we unlock so we free
    the right memory.

    perf/x86: Honor the architectural performance monitoring version
    
    commit 2c33645d366d13b969d936b68b9f4875b1fdddea upstream.
    
    Architectural performance monitoring, version 1, doesn't support fixed counters.
    
    Currently, even if a hypervisor advertises support for architectural
    performance monitoring version 1, perf may still try to use the fixed
    counters, as the constraints are set up based on the CPU model.
    
    This patch ensures that perf honors the architectural performance monitoring
    version returned by CPUID, and it only uses the fixed counters for version 2
    and above.
    
    (Some of the ideas in this patch came from Peter Zijlstra.)

    The window trap handlers are slightly clever, the trap table entries for them are
    composed of two pieces of code.  First comes the code that actually performs
    the window fill or spill trap handling, and then there are three instructions at
    the end which are for exception processing.
    
    The userland register window fill handler is:
    
            add     %sp, STACK_BIAS + 0x00, %g1;            \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g0] ASI, %l0;                   \

            b,a,pt  %xcc, fill_fixup;
    
    And the way this works is that if any of those memory accesses
    generate an exception, the exception handler can revector to one of
    those final three branch instructions depending upon which kind of
    exception the memory access took.  In this way, the fault handler
    doesn't have to know if it was a spill or a fill that it's handling
    the fault for.  It just always branches to the last instruction in
    the parent trap's handler.
    
    For example, for a regular fault, the code goes:
    
    winfix_trampoline:
            rdpr    %tpc, %g3
            or      %g3, 0x7c, %g3
            wrpr    %g3, %tnpc
            done
    
    All window trap handlers are 0x80 aligned, so if we "or" 0x7c into the
    trap time program counter, we'll get that final instruction in the
    trap handler.
    
    On return from trap, we have to pull the register window in but we do
    this by hand instead of just executing a "restore" instruction for
    several reasons.  The largest being that from Niagara and onward we
    simply don't have enough levels in the trap stack to fully resolve all
    possible exception cases of a window fault when we are already at
    trap level 1 (which we enter to get ready to return from the original
    trap).
    
    This is executed inline via the FILL_*_RTRAP handlers.  rtrap_64.S's
    code branches directly to these to do the window fill by hand if
    necessary.  Now if you look at them, we'll see at the end:
    
                ba,a,pt    %xcc, user_rtt_fill_fixup;
                ba,a,pt    %xcc, user_rtt_fill_fixup;
                ba,a,pt    %xcc, user_rtt_fill_fixup;
    
    And oops, all three cases are handled like a fault.
    
    This doesn't work because each of these trap types (data access
    exception, memory address unaligned, and faults) store their auxiliary
    info in different registers to pass on to the C handler which does the
    real work.
    
    So in the case where the stack was unaligned, the unaligned trap
    handler sets up the arg registers one way, and then we branched to
    the fault handler which expects them setup another way.
    
    So the FAULT_TYPE_* value ends up basically being garbage, and
    randomly would generate the backtrace seen above.

    The panic happened at line 760(file arch/sparc/kernel/iommu.c)

    759 {

    761         u64 dma_addr_mask = iommu->dma_addr_mask;

    773
    774         return 0;
    775 }
    776 EXPORT_SYMBOL(dma_supported);
    
    Same panic happened with Intel ixgbe driver also.
    
    SR-IOV code looks for arch specific data while enabling
    VFs. When VF device is added, driver probe function makes set
    of calls to initialize the pci device. Because the VF device is
    added different way than the normal PF device(which happens via
    of_create_pci_dev for sparc), some of the arch specific initialization
    does not happen for VF device.  That causes panic when archdata is
    accessed.
    
    To fix this, I have used already defined weak function
    pcibios_setup_device to copy archdata from PF to VF.
    Also verified the fix.

    sparc64: Fix bootup regressions on some Kconfig combinations.
    
    [ Upstream commit 49fa5230462f9f2c4e97c81356473a6bdf06c422 ]
    
    The system call tracing bug fix mentioned in the Fixes tag
    below increased the amount of assembler code in the sequence
    of assembler files included by head_64.S
    
    This caused to total set of code to exceed 0x4000 bytes in
    size, which overflows the expression in head_64.S that works
    to place swapper_tsb at address 0x408000.
    
    When this is violated, the TSB is not properly aligned, and
    also the trap table is not aligned properly either.  All of
    this together results in failed boots.
    
    So, do two things:
    
    1) Simplify some code by using ba,a instead of ba/nop to get
       those bytes back.
    
    2) Add a linker script assertion to make sure that if this
       happens again the build will fail.

    powerpc/pseries/eeh: Handle RTAS delay requests in configure_bridge
    
    commit 871e178e0f2c4fa788f694721a10b4758d494ce1 upstream.
    
    In the "ibm,configure-pe" and "ibm,configure-bridge" RTAS calls, the
    spec states that values of 9900-9905 can be returned, indicating that
    software should delay for 10^x (where x is the last digit, i.e. 990x)
    milliseconds and attempt the call again. Currently, the kernel doesn't
    know about this, and respecting it fixes some PCI failures when the
    hypervisor is busy.
    
    The delay is capped at 0.2 seconds.

    PCI/AER: Clear error status registers during enumeration and restore
    
    commit b07461a8e45b7a62ef7fb46e4f6ada66f63406a8 upstream.
    
    AER errors might be recorded when powering-on devices.  These errors can be
    ignored, so firmware usually clears them before the OS enumerates devices.
    However, firmware is not involved when devices are added via hotplug, so
