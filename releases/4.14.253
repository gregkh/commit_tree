    ARM: 9122/1: select HAVE_FUTEX_CMPXCHG
    
    commit 9d417cbe36eee7afdd85c2e871685f8dab7c2dba upstream.
    
    tglx notes:
      This function [futex_detect_cmpxchg] is only needed when an
      architecture has to runtime discover whether the CPU supports it or
      not.  ARM has unconditional support for this, so the obvious thing to
      do is the below.
    
    Fixes linkage failure from Clang randconfigs:
    kernel/futex.o:(.text.fixup+0x5c): relocation truncated to fit: R_ARM_JUMP24 against `.init.text'
    and boot failures for CONFIG_THUMB2_KERNEL.

    tracing: Have all levels of checks prevent recursion
    
    commit ed65df63a39a3f6ed04f7258de8b6789e5021c18 upstream.
    
    While writing an email explaining the "bit = 0" logic for a discussion on
    making ftrace_test_recursion_trylock() disable preemption, I discovered a
    path that makes the "not do the logic if bit is zero" unsafe.
    
    The recursion logic is done in hot paths like the function tracer. Thus,
    any code executed causes noticeable overhead. Thus, tricks are done to try
    to limit the amount of code executed. This included the recursion testing
    logic.
    
    Having recursion testing is important, as there are many paths that can
    end up in an infinite recursion cycle when tracing every function in the
    kernel. Thus protection is needed to prevent that from happening.
    
    Because it is OK to recurse due to different running context levels (e.g.
    an interrupt preempts a trace, and then a trace occurs in the interrupt
    handler), a set of bits are used to know which context one is in (normal,
    softirq, irq and NMI). If a recursion occurs in the same level, it is
    prevented*.
    
    Then there are infrastructure levels of recursion as well. When more than
    one callback is attached to the same function to trace, it calls a loop
    function to iterate over all the callbacks. Both the callbacks and the
    loop function have recursion protection. The callbacks use the
    "ftrace_test_recursion_trylock()" which has a "function" set of context
    bits to test, and the loop function calls the internal
    trace_test_and_set_recursion() directly, with an "internal" set of bits.
    
    If an architecture does not implement all the features supported by ftrace
    then the callbacks are never called directly, and the loop function is
    called instead, which will implement the features of ftrace.
    
    Since both the loop function and the callbacks do recursion protection, it
    was seemed unnecessary to do it in both locations. Thus, a trick was made
    to have the internal set of recursion bits at a more significant bit
    location than the function bits. Then, if any of the higher bits were set,
    the logic of the function bits could be skipped, as any new recursion
    would first have to go through the loop function.
    
    This is true for architectures that do not support all the ftrace
    features, because all functions being traced must first go through the
    loop function before going to the callbacks. But this is not true for
    architectures that support all the ftrace features. That's because the
    loop function could be called due to two callbacks attached to the same
    function, but then a recursion function inside the callback could be
    called that does not share any other callback, and it will be called
    directly.
    
    i.e.
    
     traced_function_1: [ more than one callback tracing it ]
       call loop_func
    
     loop_func:
       trace_recursion set internal bit
       call callback
    
     callback:
       trace_recursion [ skipped because internal bit is set, return 0 ]
       call traced_function_2
    
     traced_function_2: [ only traced by above callback ]
       call callback
    
     callback:
       trace_recursion [ skipped because internal bit is set, return 0 ]
       call traced_function_2
    
     [ wash, rinse, repeat, BOOM! out of shampoo! ]
    
    Thus, the "bit == 0 skip" trick is not safe, unless the loop function is
    call for all functions.
    
    Since we want to encourage architectures to implement all ftrace features,
    having them slow down due to this extra logic may encourage the
    maintainers to update to the latest ftrace features. And because this
    logic is only safe for them, remove it completely.
    
     [*] There is on layer of recursion that is allowed, and that is to allow
         for the transition between interrupt context (normal -> softirq ->
         irq -> NMI), because a trace may occur before the context update is
         visible to the trace recursion logic.

    scsi: core: Fix shost->cmd_per_lun calculation in scsi_add_host_with_dma()
    
    commit 50b6cb3516365cb69753b006be2b61c966b70588 upstream.
    
    After commit ea2f0f77538c ("scsi: core: Cap scsi_host cmd_per_lun at
    can_queue"), a 416-CPU VM running on Hyper-V hangs during boot because the
    hv_storvsc driver sets scsi_driver.can_queue to an integer value that
    exceeds SHRT_MAX, and hence scsi_add_host_with_dma() sets
    shost->cmd_per_lun to a negative "short" value.
    
    Use min_t(int, ...) to work around the issue.

    ALSA: hda: avoid write to STATESTS if controller is in reset
    
    [ Upstream commit b37a15188eae9d4c49c5bb035e0c8d4058e4d9b3 ]
    
    The snd_hdac_bus_reset_link() contains logic to clear STATESTS register
    before performing controller reset. This code dates back to an old
    bugfix in commit e8a7f136f5ed ("[ALSA] hda-intel - Improve HD-audio
    codec probing robustness"). Originally the code was added to
    azx_reset().
    
    The code was moved around in commit a41d122449be ("ALSA: hda - Embed bus
    into controller object") and ended up to snd_hdac_bus_reset_link() and
    called primarily via snd_hdac_bus_init_chip().
    
    The logic to clear STATESTS is correct when snd_hdac_bus_init_chip() is
    called when controller is not in reset. In this case, STATESTS can be
    cleared. This can be useful e.g. when forcing a controller reset to retry
    codec probe. A normal non-power-on reset will not clear the bits.
    
    However, this old logic is problematic when controller is already in
    reset. The HDA specification states that controller must be taken out of
    reset before writing to registers other than GCTL.CRST (1.0a spec,
    3.3.7). The write to STATESTS in snd_hdac_bus_reset_link() will be lost
    if the controller is already in reset per the HDA specification mentioned.
    
    This has been harmless on older hardware. On newer generation of Intel
    PCIe based HDA controllers, if configured to report issues, this write
    will emit an unsupported request error. If ACPI Platform Error Interface
    (APEI) is enabled in kernel, this will end up to kernel log.
    
    Fix the code in snd_hdac_bus_reset_link() to only clear the STATESTS if
    the function is called when controller is not in reset. Otherwise
    clearing the bits is not possible and should be skipped.

    [ Upstream commit 6636fec29cdf6665bd219564609e8651f6ddc142 ]
    
    On SPEAr3xx, ethernet driver is not compatible with the SPEAr600
    one.
    Indeed, SPEAr3xx uses an earlier version of this IP (v3.40) and
    needs some driver tuning compare to SPEAr600.
    
    The v3.40 IP support was added to stmmac driver and this patch
    fixes this issue and use the correct compatible string for

    btrfs: deal with errors when checking if a dir entry exists during log replay
    
    [ Upstream commit 77a5b9e3d14cbce49ceed2766b2003c034c066dc ]
    
    Currently inode_in_dir() ignores errors returned from
    btrfs_lookup_dir_index_item() and from btrfs_lookup_dir_item(), treating
    any errors as if the directory entry does not exists in the fs/subvolume
    tree, which is obviously not correct, as we can get errors such as -EIO
    when reading extent buffers while searching the fs/subvolume's tree.
    
    Fix that by making inode_in_dir() return the errors and making its only
    caller, add_inode_ref(), deal with returned errors as well.

    isdn: cpai: check ctr->cnr to avoid array index out of bound
    
    commit 1f3e2e97c003f80c4b087092b225c8787ff91e4d upstream.
    
    The cmtp_add_connection() would add a cmtp session to a controller
    and run a kernel thread to process cmtp.
    
            __module_get(THIS_MODULE);
            session->task = kthread_run(cmtp_session, session, "kcmtpd_ctr_%d",

    During this process, the kernel thread would call detach_capi_ctr()
    to detach a register controller. if the controller
    was not attached yet, detach_capi_ctr() would
    trigger an array-index-out-bounds bug.

    ASoC: DAPM: Fix missing kctl change notifications
    
    commit 5af82c81b2c49cfb1cad84d9eb6eab0e3d1c4842 upstream.
    
    The put callback of a kcontrol is supposed to return 1 when the value
    is changed, and this will be notified to user-space.  However, some
    DAPM kcontrols always return 0 (except for errors), hence the
    user-space misses the update of a control value.
    
    This patch corrects the behavior by properly returning 1 when the
    value gets updated.

    commit 3c414eb65c294719a91a746260085363413f91c1 upstream.
    
    As per discussion at: https://github.com/szszoke/sennheiser-gsp670-pulseaudio-profile/issues/13
    
    The GSP670 has 2 playback and 1 recording device that by default are
    detected in an incompatible order for alsa. This may have been done to make
    it compatible for the console by the manufacturer and only affects the
    latest firmware which uses its own ID.
    
    This quirk will resolve this by reordering the channels.

    elfcore: correct reference to CONFIG_UML

    Commit 6e7b64b9dd6d ("elfcore: fix building with clang") introduces
    special handling for two architectures, ia64 and User Mode Linux.
    However, the wrong name, i.e., CONFIG_UM, for the intended Kconfig
    symbol for User-Mode Linux was used.
    
    Although the directory for User Mode Linux is ./arch/um; the Kconfig
    symbol for this architecture is called CONFIG_UML.
    
    Luckily, ./scripts/checkkconfigsymbols.py warns on non-existing configs:
    
      UM
      Referencing files: include/linux/elfcore.h
      Similar symbols: UML, NUMA
    
    Correct the name of the config to the intended one.

    ocfs2: mount fails with buffer overflow in strlen
    
    commit b15fa9224e6e1239414525d8d556d824701849fc upstream.
    
    Starting with kernel 5.11 built with CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE mouting an
    ocfs2 filesystem with either o2cb or pcmk cluster stack fails with the
    trace below.  Problem seems to be that strings for cluster stack and
    cluster name are not guaranteed to be null terminated in the disk
    representation, while strlcpy assumes that the source string is always
    null terminated.  This causes a read outside of the source string
    triggering the buffer overflow detection.

    ocfs2: fix data corruption after conversion from inline format
    
    commit 5314454ea3ff6fc746eaf71b9a7ceebed52888fa upstream.
    
    Commit 6dbf7bb55598 ("fs: Don't invalidate page buffers in
    block_write_full_page()") uncovered a latent bug in ocfs2 conversion
    from inline inode format to a normal inode format.
    
    The code in ocfs2_convert_inline_data_to_extents() attempts to zero out
    the whole cluster allocated for file data by grabbing, zeroing, and
    dirtying all pages covering this cluster.  However these pages are
    beyond i_size, thus writeback code generally ignores these dirty pages
    and no blocks were ever actually zeroed on the disk.
    
    This oversight was fixed by commit 693c241a5f6a ("ocfs2: No need to zero
    pages past i_size.") for standard ocfs2 write path, inline conversion
    path was apparently forgotten; the commit log also has a reasoning why
    the zeroing actually is not needed.
    
    After commit 6dbf7bb55598, things became worse as writeback code stopped
    invalidating buffers on pages beyond i_size and thus these pages end up
    with clean PageDirty bit but with buffers attached to these pages being
    still dirty.  So when a file is converted from inline format, then
    writeback triggers, and then the file is grown so that these pages
    become valid, the invalid dirtiness state is preserved,
    mark_buffer_dirty() does nothing on these pages (buffers are already
    dirty) but page is never written back because it is clean.  So data
    written to these pages is lost once pages are reclaimed.
    
    Simple reproducer for the problem is:
    
      xfs_io -f -c "pwrite 0 2000" -c "pwrite 2000 2000" -c "fsync" \
        -c "pwrite 4000 2000" ocfs2_file
    
    After unmounting and mounting the fs again, you can observe that end of
    'ocfs2_file' has lost its contents.
    
    Fix the problem by not doing the pointless zeroing during conversion
    from inline format similarly as in the standard write path.

    can: peak_pci: peak_pci_remove(): fix UAF
    
    commit 949fe9b35570361bc6ee2652f89a0561b26eec98 upstream.
    
    When remove the module peek_pci, referencing 'chan' again after
    releasing 'dev' will cause UAF.
    
    Fix this by releasing 'dev' later.

    NFSD: Keep existing listeners on portlist error
    
    [ Upstream commit c20106944eb679fa3ab7e686fe5f6ba30fbc51e5 ]
    
    If nfsd has existing listening sockets without any processes, then an error
    returned from svc_create_xprt() for an additional transport will remove
    those existing listeners.  We're seeing this in practice when userspace
    attempts to create rpcrdma transports without having the rpcrdma modules
    present before creating nfsd kernel processes.  Fix this by checking for
    existing sockets before calling nfsd_destroy().

    xtensa: xtfpga: Try software restart before simulating CPU reset
    
    [ Upstream commit 012e974501a270d8dfd4ee2039e1fdf7579c907e ]
    
    Rebooting xtensa images loaded with the '-kernel' option in qemu does
    not work. When executing a reboot command, the qemu session either hangs
    or experiences an endless sequence of error messages.
    
      Kernel panic - not syncing: Unrecoverable error in exception handler
    
    Reset code jumps to the CPU restart address, but Linux can not recover
    from there because code and data in the kernel init sections have been
    discarded and overwritten at this point.
    
    XTFPGA platforms have a means to reset the CPU by writing 0xdead into a
    specific FPGA IO address. When used in QEMU the kernel image loaded with
    the '-kernel' option gets restored to its original state allowing the
    machine to boot successfully.
    
    Use that mechanism to attempt a platform reset. If it does not work,
    fall back to the existing mechanism.

    Without a sensor node, the ISC will simply fail to probe, as the
    corresponding port node is missing.
    It is then logical to disable the node in the devicetree.
    If we add a port with a connection to a sensor endpoint, ISC can be enabled.

    btrfs: always wait on ordered extents at fsync time
    
    commit b5e6c3e170b77025b5f6174258c7ad71eed2d4de upstream.
    
    There's a priority inversion that exists currently with btrfs fsync.  In
    some cases we will collect outstanding ordered extents onto a list and
    only wait on them at the very last second.  However this "very last
    second" falls inside of a transaction handle, so if we are in a lower
    priority cgroup we can end up holding the transaction open for longer
    than needed, so if a high priority cgroup is also trying to fsync()
    it'll see latency.
