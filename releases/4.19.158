    Convert trailing spaces and periods in path components
    
    commit 57c176074057531b249cf522d90c22313fa74b0b upstream.
    
    When converting trailing spaces and periods in paths, do so
    for every component of the path, not just the last component.
    If the conversion is not done for every path component, then
    subsequent operations in directories with trailing spaces or
    periods (e.g. create(), mkdir()) will fail with ENOENT. This
    is because on the server, the directory will have a special
    symbol in its name, and the client needs to provide the same.

    reboot: fix overflow parsing reboot cpu number
    
    commit df5b0ab3e08a156701b537809914b339b0daa526 upstream.
    
    Limit the CPU number to num_possible_cpus(), because setting it to a

    Revert "kernel/reboot.c: convert simple_strtoul to kstrtoint"
    
    commit 8b92c4ff4423aa9900cf838d3294fcade4dbda35 upstream.
    
    Patch series "fix parsing of reboot= cmdline", v3.
    
    The parsing of the reboot= cmdline has two major errors:
    
     - a missing bound check can crash the system on reboot
    
     - parsing of the cpu number only works if specified last
    
    Fix both.
    
    This patch (of 2):
    
    This reverts commit 616feab753972b97.
    
    kstrtoint() and simple_strtoul() have a subtle difference which makes
    them non interchangeable: if a non digit character is found amid the
    parsing, the former will return an error, while the latter will just
    stop parsing, e.g.  simple_strtoul("123xyx") = 123.
    
    The kernel cmdline reboot= argument allows to specify the CPU used for
    rebooting, with the syntax `s####` among the other flags, e.g.
    "reboot=warm,s31,force", so if this flag is not the last given, it's
    silently ignored as well as the subsequent ones.

    perf/core: Fix race in the perf_mmap_close() function
    
    commit f91072ed1b7283b13ca57fcfbece5a3b92726143 upstream.
    
    There's a possible race in perf_mmap_close() when checking ring buffer's
    mmap_count refcount value. The problem is that the mmap_count check is
    not atomic because we call atomic_dec() and atomic_read() separately.
    
      perf_mmap_close:
      ...
       atomic_dec(&rb->mmap_count);
       ...
       if (atomic_read(&rb->mmap_count))
          goto out_put;
    
       <ring buffer detach>
       free_uid
    
    out_put:
      ring_buffer_put(rb); /* could be last */
    
    The race can happen when we have two (or more) events sharing same ring
    buffer and they go through atomic_dec() and then they both see 0 as refcount
    value later in atomic_read(). Then both will go on and execute code which
    is meant to be run just once.
    
    The code that detaches ring buffer is probably fine to be executed more
    than once, but the problem is in calling free_uid(), which will later on
    demonstrate in related crashes and refcount warnings, like:
    
      refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
      ...
      RIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0x6d/0xf

    perf scripting python: Avoid declaring function pointers with a visibility attribute
    
    commit d0e7b0c71fbb653de90a7163ef46912a96f0bdaf upstream.
    
    To avoid this:
    
      util/scripting-engines/trace-event-python.c: In function 'python_start_script':
      util/scripting-engines/trace-event-python.c:1595:2: error: 'visibility' attribute ignored [-Werror=attributes]
       1595 |  PyMODINIT_FUNC (*initfunc)(void);
            |  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    That started breaking when building with PYTHON=python3 and these gcc
    versions (I haven't checked with the clang ones, maybe it breaks there
    as well):
    
      # export PERF_TARBALL=http://192.168.86.5/perf/perf-5.9.0.tar.xz
      # dm  fedora:33 fedora:rawhide
         1   107.80 fedora:33         : Ok   gcc (GCC) 10.2.1 20201005 (Red Hat 10.2.1-5), clang version 11.0.0 (Fedora 11.0.0-1.fc33)

      #
    
    Avoid that by ditching that 'initfunc' function pointer with its:
    
        #define Py_EXPORTED_SYMBOL _attribute_ ((visibility ("default")))
        #define PyMODINIT_FUNC Py_EXPORTED_SYMBOL PyObject*
    
    And just call PyImport_AppendInittab() at the end of the ifdef python3
    block with the functions that were being attributed to that initfunc.

    x86/speculation: Allow IBPB to be conditionally enabled on CPUs with always-on STIBP
    
    commit 1978b3a53a74e3230cd46932b149c6e62e832e9a upstream.
    
    On AMD CPUs which have the feature X86_FEATURE_AMD_STIBP_ALWAYS_ON,
    STIBP is set to on and
    
      spectre_v2_user_stibp == SPECTRE_V2_USER_STRICT_PREFERRED
    
    At the same time, IBPB can be set to conditional.
    
    However, this leads to the case where it's impossible to turn on IBPB
    for a process because in the PR_SPEC_DISABLE case in ib_prctl_set() the
    
      spectre_v2_user_stibp == SPECTRE_V2_USER_STRICT_PREFERRED
    
    condition leads to a return before the task flag is set. Similarly,
    ib_prctl_get() will return PR_SPEC_DISABLE even though IBPB is set to
    conditional.
    
    More generally, the following cases are possible:
    
    1. STIBP = conditional && IBPB = on for spectre_v2_user=seccomp,ibpb
    2. STIBP = on && IBPB = conditional for AMD CPUs with
       X86_FEATURE_AMD_STIBP_ALWAYS_ON
    
    The first case functions correctly today, but only because
    spectre_v2_user_ibpb isn't updated to reflect the IBPB mode.
    
    At a high level, this change does one thing. If either STIBP or IBPB
    is set to conditional, allow the prctl to change the task flag.
    Also, reflect that capability when querying the state. This isn't
    perfect since it doesn't take into account if only STIBP or IBPB is
    unconditionally on. But it allows the conditional feature to work as
    expected, without affecting the unconditional one.

    random32: make prandom_u32() output unpredictable
    
    commit c51f8f88d705e06bd696d7510aff22b33eb8e638 upstream.
    
    Non-cryptographic PRNGs may have great statistical properties, but
    are usually trivially predictable to someone who knows the algorithm,
    given a small sample of their output.  An LFSR like prandom_u32() is
    particularly simple, even if the sample is widely scattered bits.
    
    It turns out the network stack uses prandom_u32() for some things like
    random port numbers which it would prefer are *not* trivially predictable.
    Predictability led to a practical DNS spoofing attack.  Oops.
    
    This patch replaces the LFSR with a homebrew cryptographic PRNG based
    on the SipHash round function, which is in turn seeded with 128 bits
    of strong random key.  (The authors of SipHash have *not* been consulted
    about this abuse of their algorithm.)  Speed is prioritized over security;
    attacks are rare, while performance is always wanted.
    
    Replacing all callers of prandom_u32() is the quick fix.
    Whether to reinstate a weaker PRNG for uses which can tolerate it
    is an open question.
    
    Commit f227e3ec3b5c ("random32: update the net random state on interrupt
    and activity") was an earlier attempt at a solution.  This patch replaces
    it.

    The caller of rtl8169_tso_csum_v2() frees the skb if false is returned.
    eth_skb_pad() internally frees the skb on error what would result in a
    double free. Therefore use __skb_put_padto() directly and instruct it

    vrf: Fix fast path output packet handling with async Netfilter rules
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e2b7fa2df4365e99934901da4fb4af52d81e820 ]
    
    VRF devices use an optimized direct path on output if a default qdisc
    is involved, calling Netfilter hooks directly. This path, however, does
    not consider Netfilter rules completing asynchronously, such as with
    NFQUEUE. The Netfilter okfn() is called for asynchronously accepted
    packets, but the VRF never passes that packet down the stack to send
    it out over the slave device. Using the slower redirect path for this
    seems not feasible, as we do not know beforehand if a Netfilter hook
    has asynchronously completing rules.
    
    Fix the use of asynchronously completing Netfilter rules in OUTPUT and
    POSTROUTING by using a special completion function that additionally
    calls dst_output() to pass the packet down the stack. Also, slightly
    adjust the use of nf_reset_ct() so that is called in the asynchronous
    case, too.

    IPv6: Set SIT tunnel hard_header_len to zero
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ef9ba4d666614497a057d09b0a6eafc1e34eadf ]
    
    Due to the legacy usage of hard_header_len for SIT tunnels while
    already using infrastructure from net/ipv4/ip_tunnel.c the
    calculation of the path MTU in tnl_update_pmtu is incorrect.
    This leads to unnecessary creation of MTU exceptions for any
    flow going over a SIT tunnel.
    
    As SIT tunnels do not have a header themsevles other than their
    transport (L3, L2) headers we're leaving hard_header_len set to zero
    as tnl_update_pmtu is already taking care of the transport headers
    sizes.
    
    This will also help avoiding unnecessary IPv6 GC runs and spinlock
    contention seen when using SIT tunnels and for more than
    net.ipv6.route.gc_thresh flows.

    swiotlb: fix "x86: Don't panic if can not alloc buffer for swiotlb"
    
    commit e9696d259d0fb5d239e8c28ca41089838ea76d13 upstream.
    
    kernel/dma/swiotlb.c:swiotlb_init gets called first and tries to
    allocate a buffer for the swiotlb. It does so by calling
    
      memblock_alloc_low(PAGE_ALIGN(bytes), PAGE_SIZE);
    
    If the allocation must fail, no_iotlb_memory is set.
    
    Later during initialization swiotlb-xen comes in
    (drivers/xen/swiotlb-xen.c:xen_swiotlb_init) and given that io_tlb_start
    is != 0, it thinks the memory is ready to use when actually it is not.
    
    When the swiotlb is actually needed, swiotlb_tbl_map_single gets called
    and since no_iotlb_memory is set the kernel panics.
    
    Instead, if swiotlb-xen.c:xen_swiotlb_init knew the swiotlb hadn't been
    initialized, it would do the initialization itself, which might still
    succeed.
    
    Fix the panic by setting io_tlb_start to 0 on swiotlb initialization
    failure, and also by setting no_iotlb_memory to false on swiotlb
    initialization success.

    erofs: derive atime instead of leaving it empty
    
    commit d3938ee23e97bfcac2e0eb6b356875da73d700df upstream.
    
    EROFS has _only one_ ondisk timestamp (ctime is currently
    documented and recorded, we might also record mtime instead
    with a new compat feature if needed) for each extended inode
    since EROFS isn't mainly for archival purposes so no need to
    keep all timestamps on disk especially for Android scenarios
    due to security concerns. Also, romfs/cramfs don't have their
    own on-disk timestamp, and squashfs only records mtime instead.
    
    Let's also derive access time from ondisk timestamp rather than
    leaving it empty, and if mtime/atime for each file are really
    needed for specific scenarios as well, we can also use xattrs
    to record them then.

    don't dump the threads that had been already exiting when zapped.
    
    commit 77f6ab8b7768cf5e6bdd0e72499270a0671506ee upstream.
    
    Coredump logics needs to report not only the registers of the dumping
    thread, but (since 2.5.43) those of other threads getting killed.
    
    Doing that might require extra state saved on the stack in asm glue at
    kernel entry; signal delivery logics does that (we need to be able to
    save sigcontext there, at the very least) and so does seccomp.
    
    That covers all callers of do_coredump().  Secondary threads get hit with
    SIGKILL and caught as soon as they reach exit_mm(), which normally happens
    in signal delivery, so those are also fine most of the time.  Unfortunately,
    it is possible to end up with secondary zapped when it has already entered
    exit(2) (or, worse yet, is oopsing).  In those cases we reach exit_mm()
    when mm->core_state is already set, but the stack contents is not what
    we would have in signal delivery.
    
    At least on two architectures (alpha and m68k) it leads to infoleaks - we
    end up with a chunk of kernel stack written into coredump, with the contents
    consisting of normal C stack frames of the call chain leading to exit_mm()
    instead of the expected copy of userland registers.  In case of alpha we
    leak 312 bytes of stack.  Other architectures (including the regset-using
    ones) might have similar problems - the normal user of regsets is ptrace
    and the state of tracee at the time of such calls is special in the same
    way signal delivery is.
    
    Note that had the zapper gotten to the exiting thread slightly later,
    it wouldn't have been included into coredump anyway - we skip the threads
    that have already cleared their ->mm.  So let's pretend that zapper always
    loses the race.  IOW, have exit_mm() only insert into the dumper list if
    we'd gotten there from handling a fatal signal[*]
    
    As the result, the callers of do_exit() that have *not* gone through get_signal()
    are not seen by coredump logics as secondary threads.  Which excludes voluntary
    exit()/oopsen/traps/etc.  The dumper thread itself is unaffected by that,
    so seccomp is fine.
    
    [*] originally I intended to add a new flag in tsk->flags, but ebiederman pointed
    out that PF_SIGNALED is already doing just what we need.

    ocfs2: initialize ip_next_orphan
    
    commit f5785283dd64867a711ca1fb1f5bb172f252ecdf upstream.
    
    Though problem if found on a lower 4.1.12 kernel, I think upstream has
    same issue.
    
    In one node in the cluster, there is the following callback trace:
    
       # cat /proc/21473/stack
       __ocfs2_cluster_lock.isra.36+0x336/0x9e0 [ocfs2]
       ocfs2_inode_lock_full_nested+0x121/0x520 [ocfs2]
       ocfs2_evict_inode+0x152/0x820 [ocfs2]
       evict+0xae/0x1a0
       iput+0x1c6/0x230
       ocfs2_orphan_filldir+0x5d/0x100 [ocfs2]
       ocfs2_dir_foreach_blk+0x490/0x4f0 [ocfs2]
       ocfs2_dir_foreach+0x29/0x30 [ocfs2]
       ocfs2_recover_orphans+0x1b6/0x9a0 [ocfs2]
       ocfs2_complete_recovery+0x1de/0x5c0 [ocfs2]
       process_one_work+0x169/0x4a0
       worker_thread+0x5b/0x560
       kthread+0xcb/0xf0
       ret_from_fork+0x61/0x90
    
    The above stack is not reasonable, the final iput shouldn't happen in
    ocfs2_orphan_filldir() function.  Looking at the code,
    
      2067         /* Skip inodes which are already added to recover list, since dio may
      2068          * happen concurrently with unlink/rename */
      2069         if (OCFS2_I(iter)->ip_next_orphan) {
      2070                 iput(iter);
      2071                 return 0;
      2072         }
      2073
    
    The logic thinks the inode is already in recover list on seeing
    ip_next_orphan is non-NULL, so it skip this inode after dropping a
    reference which incremented in ocfs2_iget().
    
    While, if the inode is already in recover list, it should have another
    reference and the iput() at line 2070 should not be the final iput
    (dropping the last reference).  So I don't think the inode is really in
    the recover list (no vmcore to confirm).
    
    Note that ocfs2_queue_orphans(), though not shown up in the call back
    trace, is holding cluster lock on the orphan directory when looking up
    for unlinked inodes.  The on disk inode eviction could involve a lot of
    IOs which may need long time to finish.  That means this node could hold
    the cluster lock for very long time, that can lead to the lock requests
    (from other nodes) to the orhpan directory hang for long time.
    
    Looking at more on ip_next_orphan, I found it's not initialized when
    allocating a new ocfs2_inode_info structure.
    
    This causes te reflink operations from some nodes hang for very long
    time waiting for the cluster lock on the orphan directory.
    
    Fix: initialize ip_next_orphan as NULL.

    and is not expecting that IRQs will be enabled inside the function.
    
    Use the _irqsave() variant so that IRQs are restored to the original state
    instead of being enabled unconditionally.

    commit 76255470ffa2795a44032e8b3c1ced11d81aa2db upstream.
    
    pm_runtime_get_sync() will increment pm usage at first and it
    will resume the device later. We should decrease the usage count
    whetever it succeeded or failed(maybe runtime of the device has
    error, or device is in inaccessible state, or other error state).
    If we do not call put operation to decrease the reference, it will
    result in reference leak in xhci_histb_probe. Moreover, this
    device cannot enter the idle state and always stay busy or other
    non-idle state later. So we fixed it by jumping to error handling
    branch.

    uio: Fix use-after-free in uio_unregister_device()
    
    commit 092561f06702dd4fdd7fb74dd3a838f1818529b7 upstream.
    
    Commit 8fd0e2a6df26 ("uio: free uio id after uio file node is freed")
    triggered KASAN use-after-free failure at deletion of TCM-user
    backstores [1].
    
    In uio_unregister_device(), struct uio_device *idev is passed to
    uio_free_minor() to refer idev->minor. However, before uio_free_minor()
    call, idev is already freed by uio_device_release() during call to
    device_unregister().
    
    To avoid reference to idev->minor after idev free, keep idev->minor
    value in a local variable. Also modify uio_free_minor() argument to
    receive the value.

    btrfs: dev-replace: fail mount if we don't have replace item with target device
    
    commit cf89af146b7e62af55470cf5f3ec3c56ec144a5e upstream.
    
    If there is a device BTRFS_DEV_REPLACE_DEVID without the device replace
    item, then it means the filesystem is inconsistent state. This is either
    corruption or a crafted image.  Fail the mount as this needs a closer
    look what is actually wrong.
    
    As of now if BTRFS_DEV_REPLACE_DEVID is present without the replace
    item, in __btrfs_free_extra_devids() we determine that there is an
    extra device, and free those extra devices but continue to mount the
    device.
    However, we were wrong in keeping tack of the rw_devices so the syzbot
    testcase failed:

    ext4: correctly report "not supported" for {usr,grp}jquota when !CONFIG_QUOTA
    
    commit 174fe5ba2d1ea0d6c5ab2a7d4aa058d6d497ae4d upstream.
    
    The macro MOPT_Q is used to indicates the mount option is related to
    quota stuff and is defined to be MOPT_NOSUPPORT when CONFIG_QUOTA is
    disabled.  Normally the quota options are handled explicitly, so it
    didn't matter that the MOPT_STRING flag was missing, even though the
    usrjquota and grpjquota mount options take a string argument.  It's
    important that's present in the !CONFIG_QUOTA case, since without
    MOPT_STRING, the mount option matcher will match usrjquota= followed
    by an integer, and will otherwise skip the table entry, and so "mount
    option not supported" error message is never reported.
    
    [ Fixed up the commit description to better explain why the fix
      works. --TYT ]

    lan743x: fix "BUG: invalid wait context" when setting rx mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b52a4b65bc8f14520fe6e996ea7fb3f7e400761 ]
    
    In the net core, the struct net_device_ops -> ndo_set_rx_mode()
    callback is called with the dev->addr_list_lock spinlock held.
    
    However, this driver's ndo_set_rx_mode callback eventually calls
    lan743x_dp_write(), which acquires a mutex. Mutex acquisition
    may sleep, and this is not allowed when holding a spinlock.
    
    Fix by removing the dp_lock mutex entirely. Its purpose is to
    prevent concurrent accesses to the data port. No concurrent
    accesses are possible, because the dev->addr_list_lock
    spinlock in the core only lets through one thread at a time.

    [ Upstream commit 54e9b09e153842ab5adb8a460b891e11b39e9c3d ]
    
    Fix some serious WTF in the reference count scrubber's rmap fragment
    processing.  The code comment says that this loop is supposed to move
    all fragment records starting at or before bno onto the worklist, but
    there's no obvious reason why nr (the number of items added) should
    increment starting from 1, and breaking the loop when we've added the
    target number seems dubious since we could have more rmap fragments that
    should have been added to the worklist.
    
    This seems to manifest in xfs/411 when adding one to the refcount field.

    xfs: fix rmap key and record comparison functions
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ff646b2ceb0eec916101877f38da0b73e3a5b7f ]
    
    Keys for extent interval records in the reverse mapping btree are
    supposed to be computed as follows:
    
    (physical block, owner, fork, is_btree, is_unwritten, offset)
    
    This provides users the ability to look up a reverse mapping from a bmbt
    record -- start with the physical block; then if there are multiple
    records for the same block, move on to the owner; then the inode fork
    type; and so on to the file offset.
    
    However, the key comparison functions incorrectly remove the
    fork/btree/unwritten information that's encoded in the on-disk offset.
    This means that lookup comparisons are only done with:
    
    (physical block, owner, offset)
    
    This means that queries can return incorrect results.  On consistent
    filesystems this hasn't been an issue because blocks are never shared
    between forks or with bmbt blocks; and are never unwritten.  However,
    this bug means that online repair cannot always detect corruption in the
    key information in internal rmapbt nodes.
    
    Found by fuzzing keys[1].attrfork = ones on xfs/371.

    xfs: set the unwritten bit in rmap lookup flags in xchk_bmap_get_rmapextents
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dda3897fd90783358c4c6115ef86047d8c8f503 ]
    
    When the bmbt scrubber is looking up rmap extents, we need to set the
    extent flags from the bmbt record fully.  This will matter once we fix
    the rmap btree comparison functions to check those flags correctly.

    [ Upstream commit ea8439899c0b15a176664df62aff928010fad276 ]
    
    Pass the same oldext argument (which contains the existing rmapping's
    unwritten state) to xfs_rmap_lookup_le_range at the start of
    xfs_rmap_convert_shared.  At this point in the code, flags is zero,
    which means that we perform lookups using the wrong key.

    ARM: 9019/1: kprobes: Avoid fortify_panic() when copying optprobe template
    
    [ Upstream commit 9fa2e7af3d53a4b769136eccc32c02e128a4ee51 ]
    
    Setting both CONFIG_KPROBES=y and CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE=y on ARM leads
    to a panic in memcpy() when injecting a kprobe despite the fixes found
    in commit e46daee53bb5 ("ARM: 8806/1: kprobes: Fix false positive with
    FORTIFY_SOURCE") and commit 0ac569bf6a79 ("ARM: 8834/1: Fix: kprobes:
    optimized kprobes illegal instruction").
    
    arch/arm/include/asm/kprobes.h effectively declares
    the target type of the optprobe_template_entry assembly label as a u32
    which leads memcpy()'s __builtin_object_size() call to determine that
    the pointed-to object is of size four. However, the symbol is used as a handle
    for the optimised probe assembly template that is at least 96 bytes in size.
    The symbol's use despite its type blows up the memcpy() in ARM's
    arch_prepare_optimized_kprobe() with a false-positive fortify_panic() when it
    should instead copy the optimised probe template into place:

    pinctrl: intel: Set default bias in case no particular value given
    
    [ Upstream commit f3c75e7a9349d1d33eb53ddc1b31640994969f73 ]
    
    When GPIO library asks pin control to set the bias, it doesn't pass
    any value of it and argument is considered boolean (and this is true
    for ACPI GpioIo() / GpioInt() resources, by the way). Thus, individual
    drivers must behave well, when they got the resistance value of 1 Ohm,
    i.e. transforming it to sane default.
    
    In case of Intel pin control hardware the 5 kOhm sounds plausible
    because on one hand it's a minimum of resistors present in all
    hardware generations and at the same time it's high enough to minimize
    leakage current (will be only 200 uA with the above choice).

    mfd: sprd: Add wakeup capability for PMIC IRQ
    
    commit a75bfc824a2d33f57ebdc003bfe6b7a9e11e9cb9 upstream.
    
    When changing to use suspend-to-idle to save power, the PMIC irq can not
    wakeup the system due to lack of wakeup capability, which will cause
    the sub-irqs (such as power key) of the PMIC can not wake up the system.
    Thus we can add the wakeup capability for PMIC irq to solve this issue,
    as well as removing the IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag to allow PMIC irq to be
    a wakeup source.

    tick/common: Touch watchdog in tick_unfreeze() on all CPUs
    
    commit 5167c506d62dd9ffab73eba23c79b0a8845c9fe1 upstream.
    
    Suspend to IDLE invokes tick_unfreeze() on resume. tick_unfreeze() on the
    first resuming CPU resumes timekeeping, which also has the side effect of
    resetting the softlockup watchdog on this CPU.
    
    But on the secondary CPUs the watchdog is not reset in the resume /
    unfreeze() path, which can result in false softlockup warnings on those
    CPUs depending on the time spent in suspend.
    
    Prevent this by clearing the softlock watchdog in the unfreeze path also
    on the secondary resuming CPUs.

    tpm_tis: Disable interrupts on ThinkPad T490s
    
    [ Upstream commit b154ce11ead925de6a94feb3b0317fafeefa0ebc ]
    
    There is a misconfiguration in the bios of the gpio pin used for the
    interrupt in the T490s. When interrupts are enabled in the tpm_tis
    driver code this results in an interrupt storm. This was initially
    reported when we attempted to enable the interrupt code in the tpm_tis
    driver, which previously wasn't setting a flag to enable it. Due to
    the reports of the interrupt storm that code was reverted and we went back
    to polling instead of using interrupts. Now that we know the T490s problem
    is a firmware issue, add code to check if the system is a T490s and
    disable interrupts if that is the case. This will allow us to enable
    interrupts for everyone else. If the user has a fixed bios they can
    force the enabling of interrupts with tpm_tis.interrupts=1 on the
    kernel command line.

    s390/smp: move rcu_cpu_starting() earlier
    
    [ Upstream commit de5d9dae150ca1c1b5c7676711a9ca139d1a8dec ]
    
    The call to rcu_cpu_starting() in smp_init_secondary() is not early
    enough in the CPU-hotplug onlining process, which results in lockdep
    splats as follows:

    This is avoided by moving the call to rcu_cpu_starting up near the
    beginning of the smp_init_secondary() function. Note that the
    raw_smp_processor_id() is required in order to avoid calling into
    lockdep before RCU has declared the CPU to be watched for readers.

    iommu/amd: Increase interrupt remapping table limit to 512 entries
    
    [ Upstream commit 73db2fc595f358460ce32bcaa3be1f0cce4a2db1 ]
    
    Certain device drivers allocate IO queues on a per-cpu basis.
    On AMD EPYC platform, which can support up-to 256 cpu threads,
    this can exceed the current MAX_IRQ_PER_TABLE limit of 256,
    and result in the error message:
    
        AMD-Vi: Failed to allocate IRTE
    
    This has been observed with certain NVME devices.
    
    AMD IOMMU hardware can actually support upto 512 interrupt
    remapping table entries. Therefore, update the driver to
    match the hardware limit.
    
    Please note that this also increases the size of interrupt remapping
    table to 8KB per device when using the 128-bit IRTE format.

    [ Upstream commit 5faf50e9e9fdc2117c61ff7e20da49cd6a29e0ca ]
    
    alua_bus_detach() might be running concurrently with alua_rtpg_work(), so
    we might trip over h->sdev == NULL and call BUG_ON().  The correct way of
    handling it is to not set h->sdev to NULL in alua_bus_detach(), and call
    rcu_synchronize() before the final delete to ensure that all concurrent
    threads have left the critical section.  Then we can get rid of the
    BUG_ON() and replace it with a simple if condition.

    mac80211: fix use of skb payload instead of header
    
    [ Upstream commit 14f46c1e5108696ec1e5a129e838ecedf108c7bf ]
    
    When ieee80211_skb_resize() is called from ieee80211_build_hdr()
    the skb has no 802.11 header yet, in fact it consist only of the
    payload as the ethernet frame is removed. As such, we're using
    the payload data for ieee80211_is_mgmt(), which is of course
    completely wrong. This didn't really hurt us because these are
    always data frames, so we could only have added more tailroom
    than we needed if we determined it was a management frame and
    sdata->crypto_tx_tailroom_needed_cnt was false.
    
    However, syzbot found that of course there need not be any payload,
    so we're using at best uninitialized memory for the check.
    
    Fix this to pass explicitly the kind of frame that we have instead
    of checking there, by replacing the "bool may_encrypt" argument
    with an argument that can carry the three possible states - it's
    not going to be encrypted, it's a management frame, or it's a data
    frame (and then we check sdata->crypto_tx_tailroom_needed_cnt).

    gfs2: check for live vs. read-only file system in gfs2_fitrim
    
    [ Upstream commit c5c68724696e7d2f8db58a5fce3673208d35c485 ]
    
    Before this patch, gfs2_fitrim was not properly checking for a "live" file
    system. If the file system had something to trim and the file system
    was read-only (or spectator) it would start the trim, but when it starts
    the transaction, gfs2_trans_begin returns -EROFS (read-only file system)
    and it errors out. However, if the file system was already trimmed so
    there's no work to do, it never called gfs2_trans_begin. That code is
    bypassed so it never returns the error. Instead, it returns a good
    return code with 0 work. All this makes for inconsistent behavior:
    The same fstrim command can return -EROFS in one case and 0 in another.
    This tripped up xfstests generic/537 which reports the error as:
    
        +fstrim with unrecovered metadata just ate your filesystem
    
    This patch adds a check for a "live" (iow, active journal, iow, RW)
    file system, and if not, returns the error properly.

    gfs2: Add missing truncate_inode_pages_final for sd_aspace
    
    [ Upstream commit a9dd945ccef07a904e412f208f8de708a3d7159e ]
    
    Gfs2 creates an address space for its rgrps called sd_aspace, but it never
    called truncate_inode_pages_final on it. This confused vfs greatly which
    tried to reference the address space after gfs2 had freed the superblock
    that contained it.
    
    This patch adds a call to truncate_inode_pages_final for sd_aspace, thus
    avoiding the use-after-free.

    goku_probe() goes to error label "err" and invokes goku_remove()
    in case of failures of pci_enable_device(), pci_resource_start()

    pci_get_drvdata(pdev) and works with it without any checks, in
    particular it dereferences a corresponding pointer. But
    goku_probe() did not set this device yet. So, one can expect
    various crashes. The patch moves setting the device just after
    allocation of memory for it.

    crypto: arm64/aes-modes - get rid of literal load of addend vector
    
    commit ed6ed11830a9ded520db31a6e2b69b6b0a1eb0e2 upstream.
    
    Replace the literal load of the addend vector with a sequence that
    performs each add individually. This sequence is only 2 instructions
    longer than the original, and 2% faster on Cortex-A53.
    
    This is an improvement by itself, but also works around a Clang issue,
    whose integrated assembler does not implement the GNU ARM asm syntax
    completely, and does not support the =literal notation for FP registers

    netfilter: use actual socket sk rather than skb sk when routing harder
    
    commit 46d6c5ae953cc0be38efd0e469284df7c4328cf8 upstream.
    
    If netfilter changes the packet mark when mangling, the packet is
    rerouted using the route_me_harder set of functions. Prior to this
    commit, there's one big difference between route_me_harder and the
    ordinary initial routing functions, described in the comment above
    __ip_queue_xmit():
    
       /* Note: skb->sk can be different from sk, in case of tunnels */
       int __ip_queue_xmit(struct sock *sk, struct sk_buff *skb, struct flowi *fl,
    
    That function goes on to correctly make use of sk->sk_bound_dev_if,
    rather than skb->sk->sk_bound_dev_if. And indeed the comment is true: a
    tunnel will receive a packet in ndo_start_xmit with an initial skb->sk.
    It will make some transformations to that packet, and then it will send
    the encapsulated packet out of a *new* socket. That new socket will
    basically always have a different sk_bound_dev_if (otherwise there'd be
    a routing loop). So for the purposes of routing the encapsulated packet,
    the routing information as it pertains to the socket should come from
    that socket's sk, rather than the packet's original skb->sk. For that
    reason __ip_queue_xmit() and related functions all do the right thing.
    
    One might argue that all tunnels should just call skb_orphan(skb) before
    transmitting the encapsulated packet into the new socket. But tunnels do
    *not* do this -- and this is wisely avoided in skb_scrub_packet() too --
    because features like TSQ rely on skb->destructor() being called when
    that buffer space is truely available again. Calling skb_orphan(skb) too
    early would result in buffers filling up unnecessarily and accounting
    info being all wrong. Instead, additional routing must take into account
    the new sk, just as __ip_queue_xmit() notes.
    
    So, this commit addresses the problem by fishing the correct sk out of
    state->sk -- it's already set properly in the call to nf_hook() in
    __ip_local_out(), which receives the sk as part of its normal
    functionality. So we make sure to plumb state->sk through the various
    route_me_harder functions, and then make correct use of it following the
    example of __ip_queue_xmit().

    Btrfs: fix missing error return if writeback for extent buffer never started
    
    [ Upstream commit 0607eb1d452d45c5ac4c745a9e9e0d95152ea9d0 ]
    
    If lock_extent_buffer_for_io() fails, it returns a negative value, but its
    caller btree_write_cache_pages() ignores such error. This means that a
    call to flush_write_bio(), from lock_extent_buffer_for_io(), might have
    failed. We should make btree_write_cache_pages() notice such error values
    and stop immediatelly, making sure filemap_fdatawrite_range() returns an
    error to the transaction commit path. A failure from flush_write_bio()
    should also result in the endio callback end_bio_extent_buffer_writepage()
    being invoked, which sets the BTRFS_FS_*_ERR bits appropriately, so that
    there's no risk a transaction or log commit doesn't catch a writeback
    failure.

    tpm: efi: Don't create binary_bios_measurements file for an empty log
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ffd778aff45be760292225049e0141255d4ad6e ]
    
    Mimic the pre-existing ACPI and Device Tree event log behavior by not

    In this situation, the bios_event_log pointer in the tpm_bios_log struct
    was not NULL but was equal to the ZERO_SIZE_PTR (0x10) value. This was
    due to the following kmemdup() in tpm_read_log_efi():
    
    int tpm_read_log_efi(struct tpm_chip *chip)
    {
    ...
            /* malloc EventLog space */
            log->bios_event_log = kmemdup(log_tbl->log, log_size, GFP_KERNEL);
            if (!log->bios_event_log) {
                    ret = -ENOMEM;
                    goto out;
            }
    ...
    }
    
    When log_size is zero, due to an empty event log from firmware,
    ZERO_SIZE_PTR is returned from kmemdup(). Upon a read of the
    binary_bios_measurements file, the tpm2_bios_measurements_start()
    function does not perform a ZERO_OR_NULL_PTR() check on the
    bios_event_log pointer before dereferencing it.
    
    Rather than add a ZERO_OR_NULL_PTR() check in functions that make use of
    the bios_event_log pointer, simply avoid creating the
    binary_bios_measurements_file as is done in other event log retrieval
    backends.
    
    Explicitly ignore all of the events in the final event log when the main
    event log is empty. The list of events in the final event log cannot be
    accurately parsed without referring to the first event in the main event
    log (the event log header) so the final event log is useless in such a
    situation.

    xfs: flush new eof page on truncate to avoid post-eof corruption
    
    [ Upstream commit 869ae85dae64b5540e4362d7fe4cd520e10ec05c ]
    
    It is possible to expose non-zeroed post-EOF data in XFS if the new
    EOF page is dirty, backed by an unwritten block and the truncate
    happens to race with writeback. iomap_truncate_page() will not zero
    the post-EOF portion of the page if the underlying block is
    unwritten. The subsequent call to truncate_setsize() will, but
    doesn't dirty the page. Therefore, if writeback happens to complete
    after iomap_truncate_page() (so it still sees the unwritten block)
    but before truncate_setsize(), the cached page becomes inconsistent
    with the on-disk block. A mapped read after the associated page is
    reclaimed or invalidated exposes non-zero post-EOF data.
    
    For example, consider the following sequence when run on a kernel
    modified to explicitly flush the new EOF page within the race
    window:
    
    $ xfs_io -fc "falloc 0 4k" -c fsync /mnt/file
    $ xfs_io -c "pwrite 0 4k" -c "truncate 1k" /mnt/file
      ...
    $ xfs_io -c "mmap 0 4k" -c "mread -v 1k 8" /mnt/file
    00000400:  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ........
    $ umount /mnt/; mount <dev> /mnt/
    $ xfs_io -c "mmap 0 4k" -c "mread -v 1k 8" /mnt/file
    00000400:  cd cd cd cd cd cd cd cd  ........
    
    Update xfs_setattr_size() to explicitly flush the new EOF page prior
    to the page truncate to ensure iomap has the latest state of the
    underlying block.

    can: peak_canfd: pucan_handle_can_rx(): fix echo management when loopback is on
    
    [ Upstream commit 93ef65e5a6357cc7381f85fcec9283fe29970045 ]
    
    Echo management is driven by PUCAN_MSG_LOOPED_BACK bit, while loopback
    frames are identified with PUCAN_MSG_SELF_RECEIVE bit. Those bits are set
    for each outgoing frame written to the IP core so that a copy of each one
    will be placed into the rx path. Thus,
    
    - when PUCAN_MSG_LOOPED_BACK is set then the rx frame is an echo of a
      previously sent frame,
    - when PUCAN_MSG_LOOPED_BACK+PUCAN_MSG_SELF_RECEIVE are set, then the rx
      frame is an echo AND a loopback frame. Therefore, this frame must be
      put into the socket rx path too.
    
    This patch fixes how CAN frames are handled when these are sent while the
    can interface is configured in "loopback on" mode.

    can: peak_usb: peak_usb_get_ts_time(): fix timestamp wrapping
    
    [ Upstream commit ecc7b4187dd388549544195fb13a11b4ea8e6a84 ]
    
    Fabian Inostroza <fabianinostrozap@gmail.com> has discovered a potential
    problem in the hardware timestamp reporting from the PCAN-USB USB CAN interface
    (only), related to the fact that a timestamp of an event may precede the
    timestamp used for synchronization when both records are part of the same USB
    packet. However, this case was used to detect the wrapping of the time counter.
    
    This patch details and fixes the two identified cases where this problem can
    occur.

    These values come from skb->data so Smatch considers them untrusted.  I
    believe Smatch is correct but I don't have a way to test this.
    
    The usb_if->dev[] array has 2 elements but the index is in the 0-15
    range without checks.  The cfd->len can be up to 255 but the maximum
    valid size is CANFD_MAX_DLEN (64) so that could lead to memory
    corruption.

    can: can_create_echo_skb(): fix echo skb generation: always use skb_clone()
    
    [ Upstream commit 286228d382ba6320f04fa2e7c6fc8d4d92e428f4 ]
    
    All user space generated SKBs are owned by a socket (unless injected into the
    key via AF_PACKET). If a socket is closed, all associated skbs will be cleaned
    up.
    
    This leads to a problem when a CAN driver calls can_put_echo_skb() on a
    unshared SKB. If the socket is closed prior to the TX complete handler,
    can_get_echo_skb() and the subsequent delivering of the echo SKB to all
    registered callbacks, a SKB with a refcount of 0 is delivered.
    
    To avoid the problem, in can_get_echo_skb() the original SKB is now always
    cloned, regardless of shared SKB or not. If the process exists it can now
    safely discard its SKBs, without disturbing the delivery of the echo SKB.
    
    The problem shows up in the j1939 stack, when it clones the incoming skb, which
    detects the already 0 refcount.
    
    We can easily reproduce this with following example:
    
    testj1939 -B -r can0: &

    [ Upstream commit ed3320cec279407a86bc4c72edc4a39eb49165ec ]
    
    The can_get_echo_skb() function returns the number of received bytes to
    be used for netdev statistics. In the case of RTR frames we get a valid
    (potential non-zero) data length value which has to be passed for further
    operations. But on the wire RTR frames have no payload length. Therefore
    the value to be used in the statistics has to be zero for RTR frames.

    can: dev: can_get_echo_skb(): prevent call to kfree_skb() in hard IRQ context
    
    [ Upstream commit 2283f79b22684d2812e5c76fc2280aae00390365 ]
    
    If a driver calls can_get_echo_skb() during a hardware IRQ (which is often, but
    not always, the case), the 'WARN_ON(in_irq)' in
    net/core/skbuff.c#skb_release_head_state() might be triggered, under network
    congestion circumstances, together with the potential risk of a NULL pointer
    dereference.
    
    The root cause of this issue is the call to kfree_skb() instead of
    dev_kfree_skb_irq() in net/core/dev.c#enqueue_to_backlog().
    
    This patch prevents the skb to be freed within the call to netif_rx() by
    incrementing its reference count with skb_get(). The skb is finally freed by
    one of the in-irq-context safe functions: dev_consume_skb_any() or
    dev_kfree_skb_any(). The "any" version is used because some drivers might call
    can_get_echo_skb() in a normal context.
    
    The reason for this issue to occur is that initially, in the core network
    stack, loopback skb were not supposed to be received in hardware IRQ context.
    The CAN stack is an exeption.
    
    This bug was previously reported back in 2017 in [1] but the proposed patch
    never got accepted.
    
    While [1] directly modifies net/core/dev.c, we try to propose here a
    smoother modification local to CAN network stack (the assumption
    behind is that only CAN devices are affected by this issue).

    can: rx-offload: don't call kfree_skb() from IRQ context
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ddd6bfe7bdbb6c661835c3ff9cab8e0769940a6 ]
    
    A CAN driver, using the rx-offload infrastructure, is reading CAN frames
    (usually in IRQ context) from the hardware and placing it into the rx-offload
    queue to be delivered to the networking stack via NAPI.
    
    In case the rx-offload queue is full, trying to add more skbs results in the
    skbs being dropped using kfree_skb(). If done from hard-IRQ context this
    results in the following warning:

    netfilter: ipset: Update byte and packet counters regardless of whether they match
    
    [ Upstream commit 7d10e62c2ff8e084c136c94d32d9a94de4d31248 ]
    
    In ip_set_match_extensions(), for sets with counters, we take care of
    updating counters themselves by calling ip_set_update_counter(), and of
    checking if the given comparison and values match, by calling
    ip_set_match_counter() if needed.
    
    However, if a given comparison on counters doesn't match the configured
    values, that doesn't mean the set entry itself isn't matching.
    
    This fix restores the behaviour we had before commit 4750005a85f7
    ("netfilter: ipset: Fix "don't update counters" mode when counters used
    at the matching"), without reintroducing the issue fixed there: back
    then, mtype_data_match() first updated counters in any case, and then
    took care of matching on counters.
    
    Now, if the IPSET_FLAG_SKIP_COUNTER_UPDATE flag is set,
    ip_set_update_counter() will anyway skip counter updates if desired.
    
    The issue observed is illustrated by this reproducer:
    
      ipset create c hash:ip counters
      ipset add c 192.0.2.1
      iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set c src --bytes-gt 800 -j DROP
    
    if we now send packets from 192.0.2.1, bytes and packets counters
    for the entry as shown by 'ipset list' are always zero, and, no
    matter how many bytes we send, the rule will never match, because
    counters themselves are not updated.

    xfs: set xefi_discard when creating a deferred agfl free log intent item
    
    [ Upstream commit 2c334e12f957cd8c6bb66b4aa3f79848b7c33cab ]
    
    Make sure that we actually initialize xefi_discard when we're scheduling
    a deferred free of an AGFL block.  This was (eventually) found by the
    UBSAN while I was banging on realtime rmap problems, but it exists in
    the upstream codebase.  While we're at it, rearrange the structure to
    reduce the struct size from 64 to 56 bytes.

    net: xfrm: fix a race condition during allocing spi
    
    [ Upstream commit a779d91314ca7208b7feb3ad817b62904397c56d ]
    
    we found that the following race condition exists in
    xfrm_alloc_userspi flow:
    
    user thread                                    state_hash_work thread
    ----                                           ----
    xfrm_alloc_userspi()
     __find_acq_core()
       /*alloc new xfrm_state:x*/
       xfrm_state_alloc()
       /*schedule state_hash_work thread*/
       xfrm_hash_grow_check()                      xfrm_hash_resize()
     xfrm_alloc_spi                                  /*hold lock*/
          x->id.spi = htonl(spi)                     spin_lock_bh(&net->xfrm.xfrm_state_lock)
          /*waiting lock release*/                     xfrm_hash_transfer()
          spin_lock_bh(&net->xfrm.xfrm_state_lock)      /*add x into hlist:net->xfrm.state_byspi*/
                                                            hlist_add_head_rcu(&x->byspi)
                                                     spin_unlock_bh(&net->xfrm.xfrm_state_lock)
    
        /*add x into hlist:net->xfrm.state_byspi 2 times*/
        hlist_add_head_rcu(&x->byspi)
    
    1. a new state x is alloced in xfrm_state_alloc() and added into the bydst hlist
    in  __find_acq_core() on the LHS;
    2. on the RHS, state_hash_work thread travels the old bydst and tranfers every xfrm_state
    (include x) into the new bydst hlist and new byspi hlist;
    3. user thread on the LHS gets the lock and adds x into the new byspi hlist again.
    
    So the same xfrm_state (x) is added into the same list_hash
    (net->xfrm.state_byspi) 2 times that makes the list_hash become
    an inifite loop.
    
    To fix the race, x->id.spi = htonl(spi) in the xfrm_alloc_spi() is moved
    to the back of spin_lock_bh, sothat state_hash_work thread no longer add x
    which id.spi is zero into the hash_list.

    All of these lockup reports have the call chain btrfs_clone_files() ->
    btrfs_clone() in common. btrfs_clone_files() calls btrfs_clone() with
    both source and destination extents locked and loops over the source
    extent to create the clones.
    
    Conditionally reschedule in the btrfs_clone() loop, to give some time back
    to other processes.

    This happens because we are holding the chunk_mutex at the time of
    adding in a new device.  However we only need to hold the
    device_list_mutex, as we're going to iterate over the fs_devices
    devices.  Move the sysfs init stuff outside of the chunk_mutex to get
    rid of this lockdep splat.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Reclaim extra TRBs after request completion
    
    [ Upstream commit 690e5c2dc29f8891fcfd30da67e0d5837c2c9df5 ]
    
    An SG request may be partially completed (due to no available TRBs).
    Don't reclaim extra TRBs and clear the needs_extra_trb flag until the
    request is fully completed. Otherwise, the driver will reclaim the wrong
    TRB.

    If there are still pending requests because no TRB was available,
    prepare more when started requests are completed.
    
    Introduce dwc3_gadget_ep_should_continue() to check for incomplete and
    pending requests to resume updating new TRBs to the controller's TRB
    cache.

    nbd: don't update block size after device is started
    
    [ Upstream commit b40813ddcd6bf9f01d020804e4cb8febc480b9e4 ]
    
    Mounted NBD device can be resized, one use case is rbd-nbd.
    
    Fix the issue by setting up default block size, then not touch it
    in nbd_size_update() any more. This kind of usage is aligned with loop
    which has same use case too.

    time: Prevent undefined behaviour in timespec64_to_ns()

    Commit bd40a175769d ("y2038: itimer: change implementation to timespec64")
    replaced the original conversion which handled time clamping correctly with
    timespec64_to_ns() which has no overflow protection.
    
    Fix it in timespec64_to_ns() as this is not necessarily limited to the
    usage in itimers.

    regulator: defer probe when trying to get voltage from unresolved supply
    
    [ Upstream commit cf1ad559a20d1930aa7b47a52f54e1f8718de301 ]
    
    regulator_get_voltage_rdev() is called in regulator probe() when
    applying machine constraints.  The "fixed" commit exposed the problem
    that non-bypassed regulators can forward the request to its parent
    (like bypassed ones) supply. Return -EPROBE_DEFER when the supply
    is expected but not resolved yet.
