    sunrpc/cache: drop reference when sunrpc_cache_pipe_upcall() detects a race
    
    commit a6ab1e8126d205238defbb55d23661a3a5c6a0d8 upstream.
    
    sunrpc_cache_pipe_upcall() can detect a race if CACHE_PENDING is no longer
    set.  In this case it aborts the queuing of the upcall.
    However it has already taken a new counted reference on "h" and
    doesn't "put" it, even though it frees the data structure holding the reference.
    
    So let's delay the "cache_get" until we know we need it.

    jme: Fix device PM wakeup API usage
    
    commit 81422e672f8181d7ad1ee6c60c723aac649f538f upstream.
    
    According to Documentation/power/devices.txt
    
    The driver should not use device_set_wakeup_enable() which is the policy
    for user to decide.
    
    Using device_init_wakeup() to initialize dev->power.should_wakeup and
    dev->power.can_wakeup on driver initialization.
    
    And use device_may_wakeup() on suspend to decide if WoL function should
    be enabled on NIC.

    bus: imx-weim: Take the 'status' property value into account
    
    commit 33b96d2c9579213cf3f36d7b29841b1e464750c4 upstream.
    
    Currently we have an incorrect behaviour when multiple devices
    are present under the weim node. For example:
    
    &weim {
            ...
            status = "okay";
    
            sram@0,0 {
                    ...
                    status = "okay";
            };
    
            mram@0,0 {
                    ...
                    status = "disabled";
            };
    };
    
    In this case only the 'sram' device should be probed and not 'mram'.
    
    However what happens currently is that the status variable is ignored,
    causing the 'sram' device to be disabled and 'mram' to be enabled.
    
    Change the weim_parse_dt() function to use
    for_each_available_child_of_node()so that the devices marked with
    'status = disabled' are not probed.

    ARM: OMAP3: Add cpuidle parameters table for omap3430
    
    commit 98f42221501353067251fbf11e732707dbb68ce3 upstream.
    
    Based on CPU type choose generic omap3 or omap3430 specific cpuidle
    parameters. Parameters for omap3430 were measured on Nokia N900 device and
    added by commit 5a1b1d3a9efa ("OMAP3: RX-51: Pass cpu idle parameters")
    which were later removed by commit 231900afba52 ("ARM: OMAP3: cpuidle -
    remove rx51 cpuidle parameters table") due to huge code complexity.
    
    This patch brings cpuidle parameters for omap3430 devices again, but uses
    simple condition based on CPU type.

    Drivers: hv: vmbus: prevent cpu offlining on newer hypervisors
    
    commit e513229b4c386e6c9f66298c13fde92f73e6e1ac upstream.
    
    When an SMP Hyper-V guest is running on top of 2012R2 Server and secondary
    cpus are sent offline (with echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu$cpu/online)
    the system freeze is observed. This happens due to the fact that on newer
    hypervisors (Win8, WS2012R2, ...) vmbus channel handlers are distributed
    across all cpus (see init_vp_index() function in drivers/hv/channel_mgmt.c)
    and on cpu offlining nobody reassigns them to CPU0. Prevent cpu offlining
    when vmbus is loaded until the issue is fixed host-side.
    
    This patch also disables hibernation but it is OK as it is also broken (MCE
    error is hit on resume). Suspend still works.
    
    Tested with WS2008R2 and WS2012R2.

    include/linux/poison.h: fix LIST_POISON{1,2} offset
    
    commit 8a5e5e02fc83aaf67053ab53b359af08c6c49aaf upstream.
    
    Poison pointer values should be small enough to find a room in
    non-mmap'able/hardly-mmap'able space.  E.g.  on x86 "poison pointer space"
    is located starting from 0x0.  Given unprivileged users cannot mmap
    anything below mmap_min_addr, it should be safe to use poison pointers
    lower than mmap_min_addr.
    
    The current poison pointer values of LIST_POISON{1,2} might be too big for
    mmap_min_addr values equal or less than 1 MB (common case, e.g.  Ubuntu
    uses only 0x10000).  There is little point to use such a big value given
    the "poison pointer space" below 1 MB is not yet exhausted.  Changing it
    to a smaller value solves the problem for small mmap_min_addr setups.
    
    The values are suggested by Solar Designer:

    serial: sh-sci: Remove cpufreq notifier to fix crash/deadlock
    
    commit ff1cab374ad98f4b9f408525ca9c08992b4ed784 upstream.
    
    The BSP team noticed that there is spin/mutex lock issue on sh-sci when
    CPUFREQ is used.  The issue is that the notifier function may call
    mutex_lock() while the spinlock is held, which can lead to a BUG().
    This may happen if CPUFREQ is changed while another CPU calls
    clk_get_rate().
    
    Taking the spinlock was added to the notifier function in commit
    e552de2413edad1a ("sh-sci: add platform device private data"), to
    protect the list of serial ports against modification during traversal.
    At that time the Common Clock Framework didn't exist yet, and
    clk_get_rate() just returned clk->rate without taking a mutex.
    Note that since commit d535a2305facf9b4 ("serial: sh-sci: Require a
    device per port mapping."), there's no longer a list of serial ports to
    traverse, and taking the spinlock became superfluous.
    
    To fix the issue, just remove the cpufreq notifier:
      1. The notifier doesn't work correctly: all it does is update stored
         clock rates; it does not update the divider in the hardware.
         The divider will only be updated when calling sci_set_termios().
         I believe this was broken back in 2004, when the old
         drivers/char/sh-sci.c driver (where the notifier did update the
         divider) was replaced by drivers/serial/sh-sci.c (where the
         notifier just updated port->uartclk).
         Cfr. full-history-linux commits 6f8deaef2e9675d9 ("[PATCH] sh: port
         sh-sci driver to the new API") and 3f73fe878dc9210a ("[PATCH]
         Remove old sh-sci driver").
      2. On modern SoCs, the sh-sci parent clock rate is no longer related
         to the CPU clock rate anyway, so using a cpufreq notifier is
         futile.

    ext4: fix NULL pointer dereference in ext4_mark_inode_dirty()
    
    commit 5e1021f2b6dff1a86a468a1424d59faae2bc63c1 upstream.
    
    ext4_reserve_inode_write() in ext4_mark_inode_dirty() could fail on
    error (e.g. EIO) and iloc.bh can be NULL in this case. But the error is
    ignored in the following "if" condition and ext4_expand_extra_isize()
    might be called with NULL iloc.bh set, which triggers NULL pointer
    dereference.
    
    This is uncovered by commit 8b4953e13f4c ("ext4: reserve code points for
    the project quota feature"), which enlarges the ext4_inode size, and
    run the following script on new kernel but with old mke2fs:
    
      #/bin/bash

      devname=ext4-error

       #define DBMSG(msg) ((verbose>1)?(msg):NULL)
    
    In 2012, Rusty did a cleanup patch that also changed the type of the
    variable to 'bool', which introduced what is now a gcc warning.
    
    This changes the type back to 'int' and adapts the module_param() line
    instead, so it should work as documented in case anyone ever cares about
    running the ancient driver with debugging.

    USB: usbip: fix potential out-of-bounds write
    
    commit b348d7dddb6c4fbfc810b7a0626e8ec9e29f7cbb upstream.
    
    Fix potential out-of-bounds write to urb->transfer_buffer
    usbip handles network communication directly in the kernel. When receiving a
    packet from its peer, usbip code parses headers according to protocol. As
    part of this parsing urb->actual_length is filled. Since the input for
    urb->actual_length comes from the network, it should be treated as untrusted.
    Any entity controlling the network may put any value in the input and the
    preallocated urb->transfer_buffer may not be large enough to hold the data.
    Thus, the malicious entity is able to write arbitrary data to kernel memory.

    workqueue: fix ghost PENDING flag while doing MQ IO

    The underlying device is a null_blk, with default parameters:
    
      queue_mode    = MQ
      submit_queues = 1
    
    Verification that nullb0 has something inflight:
    
    root@pserver8:~# cat /sys/block/nullb0/inflight
           0        1
    root@pserver8:~# find /sys/block/nullb0/mq/0/cpu* -name rq_list -print -exec cat {} \;
    ...
    /sys/block/nullb0/mq/0/cpu2/rq_list
    CTX pending:
            ffff8838038e2400
    ...
    
    During debug it became clear that stalled request is always inserted in
    the rq_list from the following path:
    
       save_stack_trace_tsk + 34
       blk_mq_insert_requests + 231
       blk_mq_flush_plug_list + 281
       blk_flush_plug_list + 199
       wait_on_page_bit + 192
       __filemap_fdatawait_range + 228
       filemap_fdatawait_range + 20
       filemap_write_and_wait_range + 63
       blkdev_fsync + 27
       vfs_fsync_range + 73
       blkdev_write_iter + 202
       __vfs_write + 170
       vfs_write + 169
       kernel_write + 56
    
    So blk_flush_plug_list() was called with from_schedule == true.
    
    If from_schedule is true, that means that finally blk_mq_insert_requests()
    offloads execution of __blk_mq_run_hw_queue() and uses kblockd workqueue,
    i.e. it calls kblockd_schedule_delayed_work_on().
    
    That means, that we race with another CPU, which is about to execute
    __blk_mq_run_hw_queue() work.
    
    Further debugging shows the following traces from different CPUs:
    
      CPU#0                                  CPU#1
      ----------------------------------     -------------------------------
      reqeust A inserted
      STORE hctx->ctx_map[0] bit marked
      kblockd_schedule...() returns 1
      <schedule to kblockd workqueue>
                                             request B inserted
                                             STORE hctx->ctx_map[1] bit marked
                                             kblockd_schedule...() returns 0
      *** WORK PENDING bit is cleared ***
      flush_busy_ctxs() is executed, but
      bit 1, set by CPU#1, is not observed
    
    As a result request B pended forever.
    
    This behaviour can be explained by speculative LOAD of hctx->ctx_map on
    CPU#0, which is reordered with clear of PENDING bit and executed _before_
    actual STORE of bit 1 on CPU#1.
    
    The proper fix is an explicit full barrier <mfence>, which guarantees
    that clear of PENDING bit is to be executed before all possible
    speculative LOADS or STORES inside actual work function.

    efi: Fix out-of-bounds read in variable_matches()
    
    commit 630ba0cc7a6dbafbdee43795617c872b35cde1b4 upstream.
    
    The variable_matches() function can currently read "var_name[len]", for
    example when:
    
     - var_name[0] == 'a',
     - len == 1
     - match_name points to the NUL-terminated string "ab".
    
    This function is supposed to accept "var_name" inputs that are not
    NUL-terminated (hence the "len" parameter"). Document the function, and
    access "var_name[*match]" only if "*match" is smaller than "len".

    ASoC: s3c24xx: use const snd_soc_component_driver pointer
    
    commit ba4bc32eaa39ba7687f0958ae90eec94da613b46 upstream.
    
    An older patch to convert the API in the s3c i2s driver
    ended up passing a const pointer into a function that takes
    a non-const pointer, so we now get a warning:
    
    sound/soc/samsung/s3c2412-i2s.c: In function 's3c2412_iis_dev_probe':

    However, the s3c_i2sv2_register_component() function again
    passes the pointer into another function taking a const, so
    we just need to change its prototype.

    Both of these drivers can return NOTIFY_BAD, but this terminates
    processing other callbacks that were registered later on the chain.
    Since the driver did nothing to log the error it seems wrong to prevent
    other interested parties from seeing it. E.g. neither of them had even
    bothered to check the type of the error to see if it was a memory error

    i2c: exynos5: Fix possible ABBA deadlock by keeping I2C clock prepared
    
    commit 10ff4c5239a137abfc896ec73ef3d15a0f86a16a upstream.
    
    The exynos5 I2C controller driver always prepares and enables a clock
    before using it and then disables unprepares it when the clock is not
    used anymore.
    
    But this can cause a possible ABBA deadlock in some scenarios since a
    driver that uses regmap to access its I2C registers, will first grab
    the regmap lock and then the I2C xfer function will grab the prepare
    lock when preparing the I2C clock. But since the clock driver also
    uses regmap for I2C accesses, preparing a clock will first grab the
    prepare lock and then the regmap lock when using the regmap API.
    
    An example of this happens on the Exynos5422 Odroid XU4 board where a
    s2mps11 PMIC is used and both the s2mps11 regulators and clk drivers
    share the same I2C regmap.
    
    The possible deadlock is reported by the kernel lockdep:
    
      Possible unsafe locking scenario:
    
            CPU0                    CPU1
            ----                    ----
       lock(sec_core:428:(regmap)->lock);
                                    lock(prepare_lock);
                                    lock(sec_core:428:(regmap)->lock);
       lock(prepare_lock);
    
      *** DEADLOCK ***
    
    Fix it by leaving the code prepared on probe and use {en,dis}able in
    the I2C transfer function.
    
    This patch is similar to commit 34e81ad5f0b6 ("i2c: s3c2410: fix ABBA
    deadlock by keeping clock prepared") that fixes the same bug in other
    driver for an I2C controller found in Samsung SoCs.

    pinctrl: single: Fix pcs_parse_bits_in_pinctrl_entry to use __ffs than ffs
    
    commit 56b367c0cd67d4c3006738e7dc9dda9273fd2bfe upstream.
    
    pcs_parse_bits_in_pinctrl_entry uses ffs which gives bit indices
    ranging from 1 to MAX. This leads to a corner case where we try to request
    the pin number = MAX and fails.
    
    bit_pos value is being calculted using ffs. pin_num_from_lsb uses
    bit_pos value. pins array is populated with:
    
    pin + pin_num_from_lsb.
    
    The above is 1 more than usual bit indices as bit_pos uses ffs to compute
    first set bit. Hence the last of the pins array is populated with the MAX
    value and not MAX - 1 which causes error when we call pin_request.
    
    mask_pos is rightly calculated as ((pcs->fmask) << (bit_pos - 1))
    Consequently val_pos and submask are correct.
    
    Hence use __ffs which gives (ffs(x) - 1) as the first bit set.

    nl80211: check netlink protocol in socket release notification
    
    commit 8f815cdde3e550e10c2736990d791f60c2ce43eb upstream.
    
    A non-privileged user can create a netlink socket with the same port_id as
    used by an existing open nl80211 netlink socket (e.g. as used by a hostapd
    process) with a different protocol number.
    
    Closing this socket will then lead to the notification going to nl80211's
    socket release notification handler, and possibly cause an action such as
    removing a virtual interface.
    
    Fix this issue by checking that the netlink protocol is NETLINK_GENERIC.
    Since generic netlink has no notifier chain of its own, we can't fix the
    problem more generically.

    crypto: gcm - Fix rfc4543 decryption crash
    
    This bug has already bee fixed upstream since 4.2.  However, it
    was fixed during the AEAD conversion so no fix was backported to
    the older kernels.
    
    When we do an RFC 4543 decryption, we will end up writing the
    ICV beyond the end of the dst buffer.  This should lead to a
    crash but for some reason it was never noticed.
    
    This patch fixes it by only writing back the ICV for encryption.

    crypto: ccp - Prevent information leakage on export
    
    commit f709b45ec461b548c41a00044dba1f1b572783bf upstream.
    
    Prevent information from leaking to userspace by doing a memset to 0 of
    the export state structure before setting the structure values and copying
    it. This prevents un-initialized padding areas from being copied into the
    export area.

    drm/qxl: fix cursor position with non-zero hotspot
    
    commit d59a1f71ff1aeda4b4630df92d3ad4e3b1dfc885 upstream.
    
    The SPICE protocol considers the position of a cursor to be the location
    of its active pixel on the display, so the cursor is drawn with its
    top-left corner at "(x - hot_spot_x, y - hot_spot_y)" but the DRM cursor
    position gives the location where the top-left corner should be drawn,
    with the hotspot being a hint for drivers that need it.
    
    This fixes the location of the window resize cursors when using Fluxbox
    with the QXL DRM driver and both the QXL and modesetting X drivers.

    futex: Acknowledge a new waiter in counter before plist
    
    commit fe1bce9e2107ba3a8faffe572483b6974201a0e6 upstream.
    
    Otherwise an incoming waker on the dest hash bucket can miss
    the waiter adding itself to the plist during the lockless
    check optimization (small window but still the correct way
    of doing this); similarly to the decrement counterpart.

    x86/iopl/64: Properly context-switch IOPL on Xen PV
    
    commit b7a584598aea7ca73140cb87b40319944dd3393f upstream.
    
    On Xen PV, regs->flags doesn't reliably reflect IOPL and the
    exit-to-userspace code doesn't change IOPL.  We need to context
    switch it manually.
    
    I'm doing this without going through paravirt because this is
    specific to Xen PV.  After the dust settles, we can merge this with
    the 32-bit code, tidy up the iopl syscall implementation, and remove
    the set_iopl pvop entirely.
    
    Fixes XSA-171.

    lib: lz4: fixed zram with lz4 on big endian machines
    
    commit 3e26a691fe3fe1e02a76e5bab0c143ace4b137b4 upstream.
    
    Based on Sergey's test patch [1], this fixes zram with lz4 compression
    on big endian cpus.
    
    Note that the 64-bit preprocessor test is not a cleanup, it's part of
    the fix, since those identifiers are bogus (for example, __ppc64__
    isn't defined anywhere else in the kernel, which means we'd fall into
    the 32-bit definitions on ppc64).
    
    Tested on ppc64 with no regression on x86_64.

    assoc_array: don't call compare_object() on a node
    
    commit 8d4a2ec1e0b41b0cf9a0c5cd4511da7f8e4f3de2 upstream.
    
    Changes since V1: fixed the description and added KASan warning.
    
    In assoc_array_insert_into_terminal_node(), we call the
    compare_object() method on all non-empty slots, even when they're
    not leaves, passing a pointer to an unexpected structure to
    compare_object(). Currently it causes an out-of-bound read access
    in keyring_compare_object detected by KASan (see below). The issue
    is easily reproduced with keyutils testsuite.
    Only call compare_object() when the slot is a leave.

    ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Fix updating of sysconfig register
    
    commit 3ca4a238106dedc285193ee47f494a6584b6fd2f upstream.
    
    Commit 127500ccb766f ("ARM: OMAP2+: Only write the sysconfig on idle
    when necessary") talks about verification of sysconfig cache value before
    updating it, only during idle path. But the patch is adding the
    verification in the enable path. So, adding the check in a proper place
    as per the commit description.
    
    Not keeping this check during enable path as there is a chance of losing
    context and it is safe to do on idle as the context of the register will
    never be lost while the device is active.
