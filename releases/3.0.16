    ath9k: Fix kernel panic in AR2427 in AP mode
    
    commit b25bfda38236f349cde0d1b28952f4eea2148d3f upstream.
    
    don't do aggregation related stuff for 'AP mode client power save
    handling' if aggregation is not enabled in the driver, otherwise it
    will lead to panic because those data structures won't be never
    intialized in 'ath_tx_node_init' if aggregation is disabled

    ptrace: partially fix the do_wait(WEXITED) vs EXIT_DEAD->EXIT_ZOMBIE race
    
    commit 50b8d257486a45cba7b65ca978986ed216bbcc10 upstream.
    
    Test-case:
    
            int main(void)
            {
                    int pid, status;
    
                    pid = fork();
                    if (!pid) {
                            for (;;) {
                                    if (!fork())
                                            return 0;
                                    if (waitpid(-1, &status, 0) < 0) {
                                            printf("ERR!! wait: %m\n");
                                            return 0;
                                    }
                            }
                    }
    
                    assert(ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, pid, 0,0) == 0);
                    assert(waitpid(-1, NULL, 0) == pid);
    
                    assert(ptrace(PTRACE_SETOPTIONS, pid, 0,
                                            PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK) == 0);
    
                    do {
                            ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, pid, 0, 0);
                            pid = waitpid(-1, NULL, 0);
                    } while (pid > 0);
    
                    return 1;
            }
    
    It fails because ->real_parent sees its child in EXIT_DEAD state
    while the tracer is going to change the state back to EXIT_ZOMBIE
    in wait_task_zombie().
    
    The offending commit is 823b018e which moved the EXIT_DEAD check,
    but in fact we should not blame it. The original code was not
    correct as well because it didn't take ptrace_reparented() into
    account and because we can't really trust ->ptrace.
    
    This patch adds the additional check to close this particular
    race but it doesn't solve the whole problem. We simply can't
    rely on ->ptrace in this case, it can be cleared if the tracer
    is multithreaded by the exiting ->parent.
    
    I think we should kill EXIT_DEAD altogether, we should always
    remove the soon-to-be-reaped child from ->children or at least
    we should never do the DEAD->ZOMBIE transition. But this is too
    complex for 3.2.

    Revert "rtc: Disable the alarm in the hardware"
    
    commit 157e8bf8b4823bfcdefa6c1548002374b61f61df upstream.
    
    This reverts commit c0afabd3d553c521e003779c127143ffde55a16f.
    
    It causes failures on Toshiba laptops - instead of disabling the alarm,
    it actually seems to enable it on the affected laptops, resulting in
    (for example) the laptop powering on automatically five minutes after
    shutdown.
    
    There's a patch for it that appears to work for at least some people,
    but it's too late to play around with this, so revert for now and try
    again in the next merge window.
    
    See for example

    xfs: log all dirty inodes in xfs_fs_sync_fs
    
    Commit be4f1ac828776bbc7868a68b465cd8eedb733cfd upstream.
    
    Since Linux 2.6.36 the writeback code has introduces various measures for
    live lock prevention during sync().  Unfortunately some of these are
    actively harmful for the XFS model, where the inode gets marked dirty for
    metadata from the data I/O handler.
    
    The older_than_this checks that are now more strictly enforced since
    
        writeback: avoid livelocking WB_SYNC_ALL writeback
    
    by only calling into __writeback_inodes_sb and thus only sampling the
    current cut off time once.  But on a slow enough devices the previous
    asynchronous sync pass might not have fully completed yet, and thus XFS
    might mark metadata dirty only after that sampling of the cut off time for
    the blocking pass already happened.  I have not myself reproduced this
    myself on a real system, but by introducing artificial delay into the
    XFS I/O completion workqueues it can be reproduced easily.
    
    Fix this by iterating over all XFS inodes in ->sync_fs and log all that
    are dirty.  This might log inode that only got redirtied after the
    previous pass, but given how cheap delayed logging of inodes is it
    isn't a major concern for performance.

    xfs: log the inode in ->write_inode calls for kupdate
    
    Commit 0b8fd3033c308e4088760aa1d38ce77197b4e074 upstream.
    
    If the writeback code writes back an inode because it has expired we currently
    use the non-blockin ->write_inode path.  This means any inode that is pinned
    is skipped.  With delayed logging and a workload that has very little log
    traffic otherwise it is very likely that an inode that gets constantly
    written to is always pinned, and thus we keep refusing to write it.  The VM
    writeback code at that point redirties it and doesn't try to write it again
    for another 30 seconds.  This means under certain scenarious time based
    metadata writeback never happens.
    
    Fix this by calling into xfs_log_inode for kupdate in addition to data
    integrity syncs, and thus transfer the inode to the log ASAP.

    xen/swiotlb: Use page alignment for early buffer allocation.
    
    commit 63a741757d15320a25ebf5778f8651cce2ed0611 upstream.
    
    This fixes an odd bug found on a Dell PowerEdge 1850/0RC130
    (BIOS A05 01/09/2006) where all of the modules doing pci_set_dma_mask
    would fail with:
    
    ata_piix 0000:00:1f.1: enabling device (0005 -> 0007)
    ata_piix 0000:00:1f.1: can't derive routing for PCI INT A
    ata_piix 0000:00:1f.1: BMDMA: failed to set dma mask, falling back to PIO
    
    The issue was the Xen-SWIOTLB was allocated such as that the end of
    buffer was stradling a page (and also above 4GB). The fix was
    spotted by Kalev Leonid  which was to piggyback on git commit
    e79f86b2ef9c0a8c47225217c1018b7d3d90101c "swiotlb: Use page alignment
    for early buffer allocation" which:
    
            We could call free_bootmem_late() if swiotlb is not used, and
            it will shrink to page alignment.
    
            So alloc them with page alignment at first, to avoid lose two pages
    
    And doing that fixes the outstanding issue.

    ipv4: reintroduce route cache garbage collector
    
    [ Upstream commit 9f28a2fc0bd77511f649c0a788c7bf9a5fd04edb ]
    
    Commit 2c8cec5c10b (ipv4: Cache learned PMTU information in inetpeer)
    removed IP route cache garbage collector a bit too soon, as this gc was
    responsible for expired routes cleanup, releasing their neighbour
    reference.
    
    As pointed out by Robert Gladewitz, recent kernels can fill and exhaust
    their neighbour cache.
    
    Reintroduce the garbage collection, since we'll have to wait our
    neighbour lookups become refcount-less to not depend on this stuff.

    sctp: Do not account for sizeof(struct sk_buff) in estimated rwnd
    
    [ Upstream commit a76c0adf60f6ca5ff3481992e4ea0383776b24d2 ]
    
    When checking whether a DATA chunk fits into the estimated rwnd a
    full sizeof(struct sk_buff) is added to the needed chunk size. This
    quickly exhausts the available rwnd space and leads to packets being
    sent which are much below the PMTU limit. This can lead to much worse
    performance.
    
    The reason for this behaviour was to avoid putting too much memory
    pressure on the receiver. The concept is not completely irational
    because a Linux receiver does in fact clone an skb for each DATA chunk
    delivered. However, Linux also reserves half the available socket
    buffer space for data structures therefore usage of it is already
    accounted for.
    
    When proposing to change this the last time it was noted that this
    behaviour was introduced to solve a performance issue caused by rwnd
    overusage in combination with small DATA chunks.
    
    Trying to reproduce this I found that with the sk_buff overhead removed,
    the performance would improve significantly unless socket buffer limits
    are increased.
    
    The following numbers have been gathered using a patched iperf
    supporting SCTP over a live 1 Gbit ethernet network. The -l option
    was used to limit DATA chunk sizes. The numbers listed are based on
    the average of 3 test runs each. Default values have been used for
    sk_(r|w)mem.

    sctp: fix incorrect overflow check on autoclose
    
    [ Upstream commit 2692ba61a82203404abd7dd2a027bda962861f74 ]
    
    Commit 8ffd3208 voids the previous patches f6778aab and 810c0719 for
    limiting the autoclose value.  If userspace passes in -1 on 32-bit
    platform, the overflow check didn't work and autoclose would be set
    to 0xffffffff.
    
    This patch defines a max_autoclose (in seconds) for limiting the value
    and exposes it through sysctl, with the following intentions.
    
    1) Avoid overflowing autoclose * HZ.
    
    2) Keep the default autoclose bound consistent across 32- and 64-bit
       platforms (INT_MAX / HZ in this patch).
    
    3) Keep the autoclose value consistent between setsockopt() and
       getsockopt() calls.

    sparc: Fix handling of orig_i0 wrt. debugging when restarting syscalls.
    
    [ A combination of upstream commits 1d299bc7732c34d85bd43ac1a8745f5a2fed2078 and
      e88d2468718b0789b4c33da2f7e1cef2a1eee279 ]
    
    Although we provide a proper way for a debugger to control whether
    syscall restart occurs, we run into problems because orig_i0 is not
    saved and restored properly.
    
    Luckily we can solve this problem without having to make debuggers
    aware of the issue.  Across system calls, several registers are
    considered volatile and can be safely clobbered.
    
    Therefore we use the pt_regs save area of one of those registers, %g6,
    as a place to save and restore orig_i0.
    
    Debuggers transparently will do the right thing because they save and
    restore this register already.

    We need to set the MSIQ to VALID before we can set it's state to IDLE.
    
    On Niagara-T3, setting the state to IDLE first was causing HV_EINVAL
    errors.  The hypervisor documentation says, rather ambiguously, that
    the MSIQ must be "initialized" before one can set the state.
    
    I previously understood this to mean merely that a successful setconf()
    operation has been performed on the MSIQ, which we have done at this
    point.  But it seems to also mean that it has been set VALID too.

    watchdog: hpwdt: Changes to handle NX secure bit in 32bit path
    
    commit e67d668e147c3b4fec638c9e0ace04319f5ceccd upstream.
    
    This patch makes use of the set_memory_x() kernel API in order
    to make necessary BIOS calls to source NMIs.
    
    This is needed for SLES11 SP2 and the latest upstream kernel as it appears
    the NX Execute Disable has grown in its control.

    futex: Fix uninterruptible loop due to gate_area
    
    commit e6780f7243eddb133cc20ec37fa69317c218b709 upstream.
    
    It was found (by Sasha) that if you use a futex located in the gate
    area we get stuck in an uninterruptible infinite loop, much like the
    ZERO_PAGE issue.
    
    While looking at this problem, PeterZ realized you'll get into similar
    trouble when hitting any install_special_pages() mapping.  And are there
    still drivers setting up their own special mmaps without page->mapping,
    and without special VM or pte flags to make get_user_pages fail?
    
    In most cases, if page->mapping is NULL, we do not need to retry at all:
    Linus points out that even /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches poses no problem,
    because it ends up using remove_mapping(), which takes care not to
    interfere when the page reference count is raised.
    
    But there is still one case which does need a retry: if memory pressure
    called shmem_writepage in between get_user_pages_fast dropping page
    table lock and our acquiring page lock, then the page gets switched from
    filecache to swapcache (and ->mapping set to NULL) whatever the refcount.
    Fault it back in to get the page->mapping needed for key->shared.inode.

    oprofile, arm/sh: Fix oprofile_arch_exit() linkage issue
    
    commit 55205c916e179e09773d98d290334d319f45ac6b upstream.
    
    This change fixes a linking problem, which happens if oprofile
    is selected to be compiled as built-in:
    
      `oprofile_arch_exit' referenced in section `.init.text' of
      arch/arm/oprofile/built-in.o: defined in discarded section
      `.exit.text' of arch/arm/oprofile/built-in.o
    
    The problem is appeared after commit 87121ca504, which
    introduced oprofile_arch_exit() calls from __init function. Note
    that the aforementioned commit has been backported to stable
    branches, and the problem is known to be reproduced at least
    with 3.0.13 and 3.1.5 kernels.

    VFS: Fix race between CPU hotplug and lglocks
    
    commit e30e2fdfe56288576ee9e04dbb06b4bd5f282203 upstream.
    
    Currently, the *_global_[un]lock_online() routines are not at all synchronized
    with CPU hotplug. Soft-lockups detected as a consequence of this race was
    reported earlier at https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/8/24/185. (Thanks to Cong Meng
    for finding out that the root-cause of this issue is the race condition
    between br_write_[un]lock() and CPU hotplug, which results in the lock states
    getting messed up).
    
    Fixing this race by just adding {get,put}_online_cpus() at appropriate places
    in *_global_[un]lock_online() is not a good option, because, then suddenly
    br_write_[un]lock() would become blocking, whereas they have been kept as
    non-blocking all this time, and we would want to keep them that way.
    
    So, overall, we want to ensure 3 things:
    1. br_write_lock() and br_write_unlock() must remain as non-blocking.
    2. The corresponding lock and unlock of the per-cpu spinlocks must not happen
       for different sets of CPUs.
    3. Either prevent any new CPU online operation in between this lock-unlock, or
       ensure that the newly onlined CPU does not proceed with its corresponding
       per-cpu spinlock unlocked.
    
    To achieve all this:
    (a) We introduce a new spinlock that is taken by the *_global_lock_online()
        routine and released by the *_global_unlock_online() routine.
    (b) We register a callback for CPU hotplug notifications, and this callback
        takes the same spinlock as above.
    (c) We maintain a bitmap which is close to the cpu_online_mask, and once it is
        initialized in the lock_init() code, all future updates to it are done in
        the callback, under the above spinlock.
    (d) The above bitmap is used (instead of cpu_online_mask) while locking and
        unlocking the per-cpu locks.
    
    The callback takes the spinlock upon the CPU_UP_PREPARE event. So, if the
    br_write_lock-unlock sequence is in progress, the callback keeps spinning,
    thus preventing the CPU online operation till the lock-unlock sequence is
    complete. This takes care of requirement (3).
    
    The bitmap that we maintain remains unmodified throughout the lock-unlock
    sequence, since all updates to it are managed by the callback, which takes
    the same spinlock as the one taken by the lock code and released only by the
    unlock routine. Combining this with (d) above, satisfies requirement (2).
    
    Overall, since we use a spinlock (mentioned in (a)) to prevent CPU hotplug
    operations from racing with br_write_lock-unlock, requirement (1) is also
    taken care of.
    
    By the way, it is to be noted that a CPU offline operation can actually run
    in parallel with our lock-unlock sequence, because our callback doesn't react
    to notifications earlier than CPU_DEAD (in order to maintain our bitmap
    properly). And this means, since we use our own bitmap (which is stale, on
    purpose) during the lock-unlock sequence, we could end up unlocking the
    per-cpu lock of an offline CPU (because we had locked it earlier, when the
    CPU was online), in order to satisfy requirement (2). But this is harmless,
    though it looks a bit awkward.

    commit e0197aae59e55c06db172bfbe1a1cdb8c0e1cab3 upstream.
    
    There is a BUG when migrating a PF_EXITING proc. Since css_set_prefetch()
    is not called for the PF_EXITING case, find_existing_css_set() will return
    NULL inside cgroup_task_migrate() causing a BUG.
    
    This bug is easy to reproduce. Create a zombie and echo its pid to
    cgroup.procs.
    
    $ cat zombie.c
    \#include <unistd.h>
    
    int main()
    {
      if (fork())
          pause();
      return 0;
    }
    $
    
    We are hitting this bug pretty regularly on ChromeOS.
    
    This bug is already fixed by Tejun Heo's cgroup patchset which is
    targetted for the next merge window:
    
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/11/1/356

    oprofile: Fix uninitialized memory access when writing to writing to oprofilefs
    
    commit 913050b91eb94f194392dd797b1ff3779f606ac0 upstream.
    
    If oprofilefs_ulong_from_user() is called with count equals
    zero, *val remains unchanged. Depending on the implementation it
    might be uninitialized.
    
    Change oprofilefs_ulong_from_user()'s interface to return count
    on success. Thus, we are able to return early if count equals
    zero which avoids using *val uninitialized. Fixing all users of
    oprofilefs_ulong_ from_user().
    
    This follows write syscall implementation when count is zero:
    "If count is zero ... [and if] no errors are detected, 0 will be
    returned without causing any other effect." (man 2 write)

    oom: fix integer overflow of points in oom_badness
    
    commit ff05b6f7ae762b6eb464183eec994b28ea09f6dd upstream.
    
    An integer overflow will happen on 64bit archs if task's sum of rss,
    swapents and nr_ptes exceeds (2^31)/1000 value.  This was introduced by
    commit
    
    f755a04 oom: use pte pages in OOM score
    
    where the oom score computation was divided into several steps and it's no
    longer computed as one expression in unsigned long(rss, swapents, nr_pte
    are unsigned long), where the result value assigned to points(int) is in
    range(1..1000).  So there could be an int overflow while computing
    
    176          points *= 1000;
    
    and points may have negative value. Meaning the oom score for a mem hog task
    will be one.
    
    196          if (points <= 0)
    197                  return 1;
    
    For example:
    [ 3366]     0  3366 35390480 24303939   5       0             0 oom01
    Out of memory: Kill process 3366 (oom01) score 1 or sacrifice child
    
    Here the oom1 process consumes more than 24303939(rss)*4096~=92GB physical
    memory, but it's oom score is one.
    
    In this situation the mem hog task is skipped and oom killer kills another and
    most probably innocent task with oom score greater than one.
    
    The points variable should be of type long instead of int to prevent the
    int overflow.

    binary_sysctl(): fix memory leak
    
    commit 3d3c8f93a237b64580c5c5e138edeb1377e98230 upstream.
    
    binary_sysctl() calls sysctl_getname() which allocates from names_cache
    slab usin __getname()
    
    The matching function to free the name is __putname(), and not putname()
    which should be used only to match getname() allocations.
    
    This is because when auditing is enabled, putname() calls audit_putname
    *instead* (not in addition) to __putname().  Then, if a syscall is in
    progress, audit_putname does not release the name - instead, it expects
    the name to get released when the syscall completes, but that will happen
    only if audit_getname() was called previously, i.e.  if the name was
    allocated with getname() rather than the naked __getname().  So,
    __getname() followed by putname() ends up leaking memory.

    percpu: fix per_cpu_ptr_to_phys() handling of non-page-aligned addresses
    
    commit 9f57bd4d6dc69a4e3bf43044fa00fcd24dd363e3 upstream.
    
    per_cpu_ptr_to_phys() incorrectly rounds up its result for non-kmalloc
    case to the page boundary, which is bogus for any non-page-aligned
    address.
    
    This affects the only in-tree user of this function - sysfs handler
    for per-cpu 'crash_notes' physical address.  The trouble is that the
    crash_notes per-cpu variable is not page-aligned:
    
    crash_notes = 0xc08e8ed4
    PER-CPU OFFSET VALUES:
     CPU 0: 3711f000
     CPU 1: 37129000
     CPU 2: 37133000
     CPU 3: 3713d000
    
    So, the per-cpu addresses are:
     crash_notes on CPU 0: f7a07ed4 => phys 36b57ed4
     crash_notes on CPU 1: f7a11ed4 => phys 36b4ded4
     crash_notes on CPU 2: f7a1bed4 => phys 36b43ed4
     crash_notes on CPU 3: f7a25ed4 => phys 36b39ed4
    
    However, /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/crash_notes says:
     /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/crash_notes: 36b57000
     /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/crash_notes: 36b4d000
     /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/crash_notes: 36b43000
     /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/crash_notes: 36b39000
    
    As you can see, all values are rounded down to a page
    boundary. Consequently, this is where kexec sets up the NOTE segments,
    and thus where the secondary kernel is looking for them. However, when
    the first kernel crashes, it saves the notes to the unaligned
    addresses, where they are not found.
    
    Fix it by adding offset_in_page() to the translated page address.

    Input: synaptics - fix touchpad not working after S2R on Vostro V13
    
    commit 8521478f67e95ada4e87970c7b41e504c724b2cf upstream.
    
    Synaptics touchpads on several Dell laptops, particularly Vostro V13
    systems, may not respond properly to PS/2 commands and queries immediately
    after resuming from suspend to RAM. This leads to unresponsive touchpad
    after suspend/resume cycle.
    
    Adding a 1-second delay after resetting the device allows touchpad to
    finish initializing (calibrating?) and start reacting properly.

            ssb: fix init regression of hostmode PCI core
    
    In ssb_pcicore_fix_sprom_core_index() the sprom on the PCI core is
    accessed, but the sprom only exists when the ssb bus is connected over
    a PCI bus to the rest of the system and not when the SSB Bus is the
    main system bus. SoCs sometimes have a PCI host controller and there
    this code will not be executed, but there are some old SoCs with an PCI
    controller in client mode around and ssb_pcicore_fix_sprom_core_index()
    should not be called on these devices too. The PCI controller on these
    devices are unused, but without this fix it results in an Data bus
    error when it gets initialized.

    block: initialize request_queue's numa node during
    
    commit 5151412dd4338b273afdb107c3772528e9e67d92 upstream.
    
    struct request_queue is allocated with __GFP_ZERO so its "node" field is
    zero before initialization.  This causes an oops if node 0 is offline in
    the page allocator because its zonelists are not initialized.  From Dave
    Young's dmesg:
    
            SRAT: Node 1 PXM 2 0-d0000000
            SRAT: Node 1 PXM 2 100000000-330000000

            Built 1 zonelists in Node order, mobility grouping on.

            IP: [<ffffffff8111c355>] __alloc_pages_nodemask+0xb5/0x870
    
    and __alloc_pages_nodemask+0xb5 translates to a NULL pointer on
    zonelist->_zonerefs.
    
    The fix is to initialize q->node at the time of allocation so the correct
    node is passed to the slab allocator later.
    
    Since blk_init_allocated_queue_node() is no longer needed, merge it with
    blk_init_allocated_queue().

    mac80211: fix another race in aggregation start
    
    commit 15062e6a8524f5977f2cbdf6e3eb2f144262f74e upstream.
    
    Emmanuel noticed that when mac80211 stops the queues
    for aggregation that can leave a packet pending. This
    packet will be given to the driver after the AMPDU
    callback, but as a non-aggregated packet which messes
    up the sequence number etc.
    
    I also noticed by looking at the code that if packets
    are being processed while we clear the WANT_START bit,
    they might see it cleared already and queue up on
    tid_tx->pending. If the driver then rejects the new
    aggregation session we leak the packet.
    
    Fix both of these issues by changing this code to not
    stop the queues at all. Instead, let packets queue up
    on the tid_tx->pending queue instead of letting them
    get to the driver, and add code to recover properly
    in case the driver rejects the session.
    
    (The patch looks large because it has to move two
    functions to before their new use.)

    SCSI: zfcp: return early from slave_destroy if slave_alloc returned early
    
    commit 44f747fff6e9f027a4866c1a6864e26ae7c510c8 upstream.
    
    zfcp_scsi_slave_destroy erroneously always tried to finish its task
    even if the corresponding previous zfcp_scsi_slave_alloc returned
    early. This can lead to kernel page faults on accessing uninitialized
    fields of struct zfcp_scsi_dev in zfcp_erp_lun_shutdown_wait. Take the
    port field of the struct to determine if slave_alloc returned early.
    
    This zfcp bug is exposed by 4e6c82b (in turn fixing f7c9c6b to be
    compatible with 21208ae) which can call slave_destroy for a
    corresponding previous slave_alloc that did not finish.

    cfq-iosched: fix cfq_cic_link() race confition
    
    commit 5eb46851de3904cd1be9192fdacb8d34deadc1fc upstream.
    
    cfq_cic_link() has race condition. When some processes which shared ioc
    issue I/O to same block device simultaneously, cfq_cic_link() returns -EEXIST
    sometimes. The race condition might stop I/O by following steps:
    
    step  1: Process A: Issue an I/O to /dev/sda
    step  2: Process A: Get an ioc (iocA here) in get_io_context() which does not
                        linked with a cic for the device
    step  3: Process A: Get a new cic for the device (cicA here) in
                        cfq_alloc_io_context()
    
    step  4: Process B: Issue an I/O to /dev/sda
    step  5: Process B: Get iocA in get_io_context() since process A and B share the
                        same ioc
    step  6: Process B: Get a new cic for the device (cicB here) in
                        cfq_alloc_io_context() since iocA has not been linked with a
                        cic for the device yet
    
    step  7: Process A: Link cicA to iocA in cfq_cic_link()
    step  8: Process A: Dispatch I/O to driver and finish it
    
    step  9: Process B: Try to link cicB to iocA in cfq_cic_link()
                        But it fails with showing "cfq: cic link failed!" kernel
                        message, since iocA has already linked with cicA at step 7.
    step 10: Process B: Wait for finishig I/O in get_request_wait()
                        The function does not wake up, when there is no I/O to the
                        device.
    
    When cfq_cic_link() returns -EEXIST, it means ioc has already linked with cic.
    So when cfq_cic_link() return -EEXIST, retry cfq_cic_lookup().

    cfq-iosched: free cic_index if blkio_alloc_blkg_stats fails
    
    commit 2984ff38ccf6cbc02a7a996a36c7d6f69f3c6146 upstream.
    
    If we fail allocating the blkpg stats, we free cfqd and cfgq.
    But we need to free the IDA cfqd->cic_index as well.

    drm/i915: prevent division by zero when asking for chipset power
    
    commit 4ed0b577457eb6aeb7cdc7e7316576e63d15abb2 upstream.
    
    This prevents an in-kernel division by zero which happens when we are
    asking for i915_chipset_val too quickly, or within a race condition
    between the power monitoring thread and userspace accesses via debugfs.
    
    The issue can be reproduced easily via the following command:
    while ``; do cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_emon_status; done
    
    This is particularly dangerous because it can be triggered by
    a non-privileged user by just reading the debugfs entry.
    
    This issue was also found independently by Konstantin Belousov
    <kostikbel@gmail.com>, who proposed a similar patch.

    rtc: m41t80: Workaround broken alarm functionality
    
    commit c3b79770e51ab1fd4201f3b54edf30113b9ce74f upstream.
    
    The m41t80 driver can read and set the alarm, but it doesn't
    seem to have a functional alarm irq.
    
    This causes failures when the generic core sees alarm functions,
    but then cannot use them properly for things like UIE mode.
    
    Disabling the alarm functions allows proper error reporting,
    and possible fallback to emulated modes. Once someone fixes
    the alarm irq functionality, this can be restored.

    ipip, sit: copy parms.name after register_netdevice
    
    commit 72b36015ba43a3cca5303f5534d2c3e1899eae29 upstream.
    
    Same fix as 731abb9cb2 for ipip and sit tunnel.
    Commit 1c5cae815d removed an explicit call to dev_alloc_name in
    ipip_tunnel_locate and ipip6_tunnel_locate, because register_netdevice
    will now create a valid name, however the tunnel keeps a copy of the
    name in the private parms structure. Fix this by copying the name back
    after register_netdevice has successfully returned.
    
    This shows up if you do a simple tunnel add, followed by a tunnel show:
    
    $ sudo ip tunnel add mode ipip remote 10.2.20.211
    $ ip tunnel
    tunl0: ip/ip  remote any  local any  ttl inherit  nopmtudisc
    tunl%d: ip/ip  remote 10.2.20.211  local any  ttl inherit
    $ sudo ip tunnel add mode sit remote 10.2.20.212
    $ ip tunnel
    sit0: ipv6/ip  remote any  local any  ttl 64  nopmtudisc 6rd-prefix 2002::/16
    sit%d: ioctl 89f8 failed: No such device
    sit%d: ipv6/ip  remote 10.2.20.212  local any  ttl inherit

    ARM: OMAP: rx51: fix USB
    
    commit e5fe29c7198a1f6616286dfc8602a69da165cb3f upstream.
    
    Commit 10299e2e4e3ed3b16503d4e04edd48b33083f4e2 (ARM: RX-51:
    Enable isp1704 power on/off) added power management for isp1704.
    
    However, the transceiver should be powered on by default,
    otherwise USB doesn't work at all for networking during
    boot.
    
    All kernels after v3.0 are affected.
