    clk: qcom: Fix MN frequency tables, parent map, and jpegd
    
    commit ff20783f7b9f35b29e768d8ecc7076c1ca1a60ca upstream.
    
    Clocks that don't have a pre-divider don't list any pre-divider
    in their frequency tables, but their tables are initialized using
    aggregate initializers. Use tagged initializers so we properly
    assign the m and n values for each frequency. Furthermore, the
    mmcc_pxo_pll8_pll2_pll3 array improperly mapped the second
    element to pll2 instead of pll8, causing the clock driver to
    recalculate the wrong rate for any clocks using this array along
    with a rate that uses pll2. Plus the .num_parents field is 3
    instead of 4 so you can't even switch the parent to pll3. Finally
    I noticed that the jpegd clock improperly indicates that the
    pre-divider width is only 2, when it's actually 4 bits wide.

    clk: prevent erronous parsing of children during rate change
    
    commit 067bb1741c27c8d3b74ac98c0b8fc12b31e67005 upstream.
    
    In some cases, clocks can switch their parent with clk_set_rate, for
    example clk_mux can do this in some cases. Current implementation of
    clk_change_rate uses un-safe list iteration on the clock children, which
    will cause wrong clocks to be parsed in case any of the clock children
    change their parents during the change rate operation. Fixed by using
    the safe list iterator instead.
    
    The problem was detected due to some divide by zero errors generated
    by clock init on dra7-evm board, see discussion under
    http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.arm.kernel/349180 for details.

    CPUs which should support the RAPL counters according to
    Family/Model/Stepping may still issue #GP when attempting to access
    the RAPL MSRs. This may happen when Linux is running under KVM and
    we are passing-through host F/M/S data, for example. Use rdmsrl_safe
    to first access the RAPL_POWER_UNIT MSR; if this fails, do not

    PM / sleep: Use valid_state() for platform-dependent sleep states only
    
    commit 43e8317b0bba1d6eb85f38a4a233d82d7c20d732 upstream.
    
    Use the observation that, for platform-dependent sleep states
    (PM_SUSPEND_STANDBY, PM_SUSPEND_MEM), a given state is either
    always supported or always unsupported and store that information
    in pm_states[] instead of calling valid_state() every time we
    need to check it.
    
    Also do not use valid_state() for PM_SUSPEND_FREEZE, which is always
    valid, and move the pm_test_level validity check for PM_SUSPEND_FREEZE
    directly into enter_state().

    xt_hashlimit cannot be used with large hash tables, because garbage

    If a devices is being recovered it is not InSync and is not Faulty.
    
    If a read error is experienced on that device, fix_read_error()
    will be called, but it ignores non-InSync devices.  So it will
    neither fix the error nor fail the device.
    
    It is incorrect that fix_read_error() ignores non-InSync devices.
    It should only ignore Faulty devices.  So fix it.
    
    This became a bug when we allowed reading from a device that was being
    recovered.  It is suitable for any subsequent -stable kernel.

    md/raid1: count resync requests in nr_pending.
    
    commit 34e97f170149bfa14979581c4c748bc9b4b79d5b upstream.
    
    Both normal IO and resync IO can be retried with reschedule_retry()
    and so be counted into ->nr_queued, but only normal IO gets counted in
    ->nr_pending.
    
    Before the recent improvement to RAID1 resync there could only
    possibly have been one or the other on the queue.  When handling a
    read failure it could only be normal IO.  So when handle_read_error()
    called freeze_array() the fact that freeze_array only compares
    ->nr_queued against ->nr_pending was safe.
    
    But now that these two types can interleave, we can have both normal
    and resync IO requests queued, so we need to count them both in
    nr_pending.
    
    This error can lead to freeze_array() hanging if there is a read
    error, so it is suitable for -stable.

    md/raid1: update next_resync under resync_lock.
    
    commit c2fd4c94deedb89ac1746c4a53219be499372c06 upstream.
    
    raise_barrier() uses next_resync as part of its calculations, so it
    really should be updated first, instead of afterwards.
    
    next_resync is always used under resync_lock so update it under
    resync lock to, just before it is used.  That is safest.
    
    This could cause normal IO and resync IO to interact badly so
    it suitable for -stable.

    md/raid1: Don't use next_resync to determine how far resync has progressed
    
    commit 235549605eb7f1c5a37cef8b09d12e6d412c5cd6 upstream.
    
    next_resync is (approximately) the location for the next resync request.
    However it does *not* reliably determine the earliest location
    at which resync might be happening.
    This is because resync requests can complete out of order, and
    we only limit the number of current requests, not the distance
    from the earliest pending request to the latest.
    
    mddev->curr_resync_completed is a reliable indicator of the earliest
    position at which resync could be happening.   It is updated less
    frequently, but is actually reliable which is more important.
    
    So use it to determine if a write request is before the region
    being resynced and so safe from conflict.
    
    This error can allow resync IO to interfere with normal IO which
    could lead to data corruption. Hence: stable.

    md/raid1: make sure resync waits for conflicting writes to complete.
    
    commit 2f73d3c55d09ce60647b96ad2a9b539c95a530ee upstream.
    
    The resync/recovery process for raid1 was recently changed
    so that writes could happen in parallel with resync providing
    they were in different regions of the device.
    
    There is a problem though:  While a write request will always
    wait for conflicting resync to complete, a resync request
    will *not* always wait for conflicting writes to complete.
    
    Two changes are needed to fix this:
    
    1/ raise_barrier (which waits until it is safe to do resync)
       must wait until current_window_requests is zero
    2/ wait_battier (which waits at the start of a new write request)
       must update current_window_requests if the request could
       possible conflict with a concurrent resync.
    
    As concurrent writes and resync can lead to data loss,
    this patch is suitable for -stable.

    md/raid1: be more cautious where we read-balance during resync.
    
    commit c6d119cf1b5a778e9ed60a006e2a434fcc4471a2 upstream.
    
    commit 79ef3a8aa1cb1523cc231c9a90a278333c21f761 made
    it possible for reads to happen concurrently with resync.
    This means that we need to be more careful where read_balancing
    is allowed during resync - we can no longer be sure that any
    resync that has already started will definitely finish.
    
    So keep read_balancing to before recovery_cp, which is conservative
    but safe.
    
    This bug makes it possible to read from a device that doesn't
    have up-to-date data, so it can cause data corruption.
    So it is suitable for any kernel since 3.11.

    md/raid1: clean up request counts properly in close_sync()
    
    commit 669cc7ba77864e7b1ac39c9f2b2afb8730f341f4 upstream.
    
    If there are outstanding writes when close_sync is called,
    the change to ->start_next_window might cause them to
    decrement the wrong counter when they complete.  Fix this
    by merging the two counters into the one that will be decremented.
    
    Having an incorrect value in a counter can cause raise_barrier()
    to hangs, so this is suitable for -stable.

    If cpufreq_driver->get(policy->cpu) returns an error we execute the
    code at err_get_freq, which does not up the policy->rwsem.  This causes
    the lockdep warning.
    
    Trivial patch to up the policy->rwsem in the error path.
    
    After the patch has been applied, and an error occurs in the
    cpufreq_driver->get(policy->cpu) call we will now see

    nl80211: clear skb cb before passing to netlink
    
    commit bd8c78e78d5011d8111bc2533ee73b13a3bd6c42 upstream.
    
    In testmode and vendor command reply/event SKBs we use the
    skb cb data to store nl80211 parameters between allocation
    and sending. This causes the code for CONFIG_NETLINK_MMAP
    to get confused, because it takes ownership of the skb cb
    data when the SKB is handed off to netlink, and it doesn't
    explicitly clear it.
    
    Clear the skb cb explicitly when we're done and before it
    gets passed to netlink to avoid this issue.

    Fix nasty 32-bit overflow bug in buffer i/o code.
    
    commit f2d5a94436cc7cc0221b9a81bba2276a25187dd3 upstream.
    
    On 32-bit architectures, the legacy buffer_head functions are not always
    handling the sector number with the proper 64-bit types, and will thus
    fail on 4TB+ disks.
    
    Any code that uses __getblk() (and thus bread(), breadahead(),
    sb_bread(), sb_breadahead(), sb_getblk()), and calls it using a 64-bit
    block on a 32-bit arch (where "long" is 32-bit) causes an inifinite loop
    in __getblk_slow() with an infinite stream of errors logged to dmesg
    like this:
    
      __find_get_block_slow() failed. block=6740375944, b_blocknr=2445408648
      b_state=0x00000020, b_size=512
      device sda1 blocksize: 512
    
    Note how in hex block is 0x191C1F988 and b_blocknr is 0x91C1F988 i.e. the
    top 32-bits are missing (in this case the 0x1 at the top).
    
    This is because grow_dev_page() is broken and has a 32-bit overflow due
    to shifting the page index value (a pgoff_t - which is just 32 bits on
    32-bit architectures) left-shifted as the block number.  But the top
    bits to get lost as the pgoff_t is not type cast to sector_t / 64-bit
    before the shift.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by type casting "index" to sector_t before
    doing the left shift.
    
    Note this is not a theoretical bug but has been seen in the field on a
    4TiB hard drive with logical sector size 512 bytes.
    
    This patch has been verified to fix the infinite loop problem on 3.17-rc5
    kernel using a 4TB disk image mounted using "-o loop".  Without this patch
    doing a "find /nt" where /nt is an NTFS volume causes the inifinite loop
    100% reproducibly whilst with the patch it works fine as expected.

    it looks like the `perf` process, when exiting, could not go
    out of the retry loop. Meanwhile, the target process was forking
    a child. So either the target process should execute the smp
    function call to deactive the event (if it was running) or it should
    do a context switch which deactives the event.
    
    It seems we optimize out a context switch in perf_event_context_sched_out(),
    and what's more important, we still test an obsolete task pointer when
    retrying, so no one actually would deactive that event in this situation.
    Fix it directly by reloading the task pointer in perf_remove_from_context().
    
    This should cure the above soft lockup.

    IB/mlx4: Avoid null pointer dereference in mlx4_ib_scan_netdevs()
    
    commit e381835cf1b8e3b2857277dbc3b77d8c5350f70a upstream.
    
    When Ethernet netdev is not present for a port (e.g. when the link
    layer type of the port is InfiniBand) it's possible to dereference a
    null pointer when we do netdevice scanning.
    
    To fix that, we move a section of code that needs to run only when
    netdev is present to a proper if () statement.

    GFS2: fix d_splice_alias() misuses
    
    commit cfb2f9d5c921e38b0f12bb26fed10b877664444d upstream.
    
    Callers of d_splice_alias(dentry, inode) don't need iput(), neither
    on success nor on failure.  Either the reference to inode is stored
    in a previously negative dentry, or it's dropped.  In either case
    inode reference the caller used to hold is consumed.
    
    __gfs2_lookup() does iput() in case when d_splice_alias() has failed.
    Double iput() if we ever hit that.  And gfs2_create_inode() ends up
    not only with double iput(), but with link count dropped to zero - on
    an inode it has just found in directory.

    alarmtimer: Lock k_itimer during timer callback
    
    commit 474e941bed9262f5fa2394f9a4a67e24499e5926 upstream.
    
    Locks the k_itimer's it_lock member when handling the alarm timer's
    expiry callback.
    
    The regular posix timers defined in posix-timers.c have this lock held
    during timout processing because their callbacks are routed through
    posix_timer_fn().  The alarm timers follow a different path, so they
    ought to grab the lock somewhere else.

    alarmtimer: Do not signal SIGEV_NONE timers
    
    commit 265b81d23a46c39df0a735a3af4238954b41a4c2 upstream.
    
    Avoids sending a signal to alarm timers created with sigev_notify set to
    SIGEV_NONE by checking for that special case in the timeout callback.
    
    The regular posix timers avoid sending signals to SIGEV_NONE timers by
    not scheduling any callbacks for them in the first place.  Although it
    would be possible to do something similar for alarm timers, it's simpler
    to handle this as a special case in the timeout.
    
    Prior to this patch, the alarm timer would ignore the sigev_notify value
    and try to deliver signals to the process anyway.  Even worse, the
    sanity check for the value of sigev_signo is skipped when SIGEV_NONE was
    specified, so the signal number could be bogus.  If sigev_signo was an
    unitialized value (as it often would be if SIGEV_NONE is used), then
    it's hard to predict which signal will be sent.

    alarmtimer: Return relative times in timer_gettime
    
    commit e86fea764991e00a03ff1e56409ec9cacdbda4c9 upstream.
    
    Returns the time remaining for an alarm timer, rather than the time at
    which it is scheduled to expire.  If the timer has already expired or it
    is not currently scheduled, the it_value's members are set to zero.
    
    This new behavior matches that of the other posix-timers and the POSIX
    specifications.
    
    This is a change in user-visible behavior, and may break existing
    applications.  Hopefully, few users rely on the old incorrect behavior.

    parisc: Only use -mfast-indirect-calls option for 32-bit kernel builds
    
    commit d26a7730b5874a5fa6779c62f4ad7c5065a94723 upstream.
    
    In spite of what the GCC manual says, the -mfast-indirect-calls has
    never been supported in the 64-bit parisc compiler. Indirect calls have
    always been done using function descriptors irrespective of the
    -mfast-indirect-calls option.
    
    Recently, it was noticed that a function descriptor was always requested
    when the -mfast-indirect-calls option was specified. This caused
    problems when the option was used in  application code and doesn't make
    any sense because the whole point of the option is to avoid using a
    function descriptor for indirect calls.
    
    Fixing this broke 64-bit kernel builds.
    
    I will fix GCC but for now we need the attached change. This results in
    the same kernel code as before.

    To avoid dummy value returned in case when root is already set (it would do
    no harm, actually, since the only caller that doesn't ignore the return value
    is guaranteed to have nd->root *not* set, but it's more obvious that way),

    powerpc: Add smp_mb()s to arch_spin_unlock_wait()
    
    commit 78e05b1421fa41ae8457701140933baa5e7d9479 upstream.
    
    Similar to the previous commit which described why we need to add a
    barrier to arch_spin_is_locked(), we have a similar problem with
    spin_unlock_wait().
    
    We need a barrier on entry to ensure any spinlock we have previously
    taken is visibly locked prior to the load of lock->slock.
    
    It's also not clear if spin_unlock_wait() is intended to have ACQUIRE
    semantics. For now be conservative and add a barrier on exit to give it
    ACQUIRE semantics.

    powerpc: Add smp_mb() to arch_spin_is_locked()
    
    commit 51d7d5205d3389a32859f9939f1093f267409929 upstream.
    
    The kernel defines the function spin_is_locked(), which can be used to
    check if a spinlock is currently locked.
    
    Using spin_is_locked() on a lock you don't hold is obviously racy. That
    is, even though you may observe that the lock is unlocked, it may become
    locked at any time.
    
    There is (at least) one exception to that, which is if two locks are
    used as a pair, and the holder of each checks the status of the other
    before doing any update.
    
    Assuming *A and *B are two locks, and *COUNTER is a shared non-atomic
    value:
    
    The first CPU does:
    
            spin_lock(*A)
    
            if spin_is_locked(*B)
                    # nothing
            else
                    smp_mb()
                    LOAD r = *COUNTER
                    r++
                    STORE *COUNTER = r
    
            spin_unlock(*A)
    
    And the second CPU does:
    
            spin_lock(*B)
    
            if spin_is_locked(*A)
                    # nothing
            else
                    smp_mb()
                    LOAD r = *COUNTER
                    r++
                    STORE *COUNTER = r
    
            spin_unlock(*B)
    
    Although this is a strange locking construct, it should work.
    
    It seems to be understood, but not documented, that spin_is_locked() is
    not a memory barrier, so in the examples above and below the caller
    inserts its own memory barrier before acting on the result of
    spin_is_locked().
    
    For now we assume spin_is_locked() is implemented as below, and we break
    it out in our examples:
    
            bool spin_is_locked(*LOCK) {
                    LOAD l = *LOCK
                    return l.locked
            }
    
    Our intuition is that there should be no problem even if the two code
    sequences run simultaneously such as:
    
            CPU 0                   CPU 1
            ==================================================
            spin_lock(*A)           spin_lock(*B)
            LOAD b = *B             LOAD a = *A
            if b.locked # true      if a.locked # true
            # nothing               # nothing
            spin_unlock(*A)         spin_unlock(*B)
    
    If one CPU gets the lock before the other then it will do the update and
    the other CPU will back off:
    
            CPU 0                   CPU 1
            ==================================================
            spin_lock(*A)
            LOAD b = *B
                                    spin_lock(*B)
            if b.locked # false     LOAD a = *A
            else                    if a.locked # true
            smp_mb()                # nothing
            LOAD r1 = *COUNTER      spin_unlock(*B)
            r1++
            STORE *COUNTER = r1
            spin_unlock(*A)
    
    However in reality spin_lock() itself is not indivisible. On powerpc we
    implement it as a load-and-reserve and store-conditional.
    
    Ignoring the retry logic for the lost reservation case, it boils down to:
            spin_lock(*LOCK) {
                    LOAD l = *LOCK
                    l.locked = true
                    STORE *LOCK = l
                    ACQUIRE_BARRIER
            }
    
    The ACQUIRE_BARRIER is required to give spin_lock() ACQUIRE semantics as
    defined in memory-barriers.txt:
    
         This acts as a one-way permeable barrier.  It guarantees that all
         memory operations after the ACQUIRE operation will appear to happen
         after the ACQUIRE operation with respect to the other components of
         the system.
    
    On modern powerpc systems we use lwsync for ACQUIRE_BARRIER. lwsync is
    also know as "lightweight sync", or "sync 1".
    
    As described in Power ISA v2.07 section B.2.1.1, in this scenario the
    lwsync is not the barrier itself. It instead causes the LOAD of *LOCK to
    act as the barrier, preventing any loads or stores in the locked region
    from occurring prior to the load of *LOCK.
    
    Whether this behaviour is in accordance with the definition of ACQUIRE
    semantics in memory-barriers.txt is open to discussion, we may switch to
    a different barrier in future.
    
    What this means in practice is that the following can occur:
    
            CPU 0                   CPU 1
            ==================================================
            LOAD a = *A             LOAD b = *B
            a.locked = true         b.locked = true
            LOAD b = *B             LOAD a = *A
            STORE *A = a            STORE *B = b
            if b.locked # false     if a.locked # false
            else                    else
            smp_mb()                smp_mb()
            LOAD r1 = *COUNTER      LOAD r2 = *COUNTER
            r1++                    r2++
            STORE *COUNTER = r1
                                    STORE *COUNTER = r2     # Lost update
            spin_unlock(*A)         spin_unlock(*B)
    
    That is, the load of *B can occur prior to the store that makes *A
    visibly locked. And similarly for CPU 1. The result is both CPUs hold
    their lock and believe the other lock is unlocked.
    
    The easiest fix for this is to add a full memory barrier to the start of
    spin_is_locked(), so adding to our previous definition would give us:
    
            bool spin_is_locked(*LOCK) {
                    smp_mb()
                    LOAD l = *LOCK
                    return l.locked
            }
    
    The new barrier orders the store to the lock we are locking vs the load
    of the other lock:
    
            CPU 0                   CPU 1
            ==================================================
            LOAD a = *A             LOAD b = *B
            a.locked = true         b.locked = true
            STORE *A = a            STORE *B = b
            smp_mb()                smp_mb()
            LOAD b = *B             LOAD a = *A
            if b.locked # true      if a.locked # true
            # nothing               # nothing
            spin_unlock(*A)         spin_unlock(*B)
    
    Although the above example is theoretical, there is code similar to this
    example in sem_lock() in ipc/sem.c. This commit in addition to the next
    commit appears to be a fix for crashes we are seeing in that code where
    we believe this race happens in practice.

    powerpc/perf: Fix ABIv2 kernel backtraces
    
    commit 85101af13bb854a6572fa540df7c7201958624b9 upstream.
    
    ABIv2 kernels are failing to backtrace through the kernel. An example:
    
    39.30%  readseek2_proce  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] find_get_entry
                |
                --- find_get_entry
                   __GI___libc_read
    
    The problem is in valid_next_sp() where we check that the new stack
    pointer is at least STACK_FRAME_OVERHEAD below the previous one.
    
    ABIv1 has a minimum stack frame size of 112 bytes consisting of 48 bytes
    and 64 bytes of parameter save area. ABIv2 changes that to 32 bytes
    with no paramter save area.
    
    STACK_FRAME_OVERHEAD is in theory the minimum stack frame size,
    but we over 240 uses of it, some of which assume that it includes
    space for the parameter area.
    
    We need to work through all our stack defines and rationalise them
    but let's fix perf now by creating STACK_FRAME_MIN_SIZE and using
    in valid_next_sp(). This fixes the issue:
    
    30.64%  readseek2_proce  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] find_get_entry
                |
                --- find_get_entry
                   pagecache_get_page
                   generic_file_read_iter
                   new_sync_read
                   vfs_read
                   sys_read
                   syscall_exit
                   __GI___libc_read

    brcmfmac: handle IF event for P2P_DEVICE interface
    
    commit 87c4790330810fe5caf0172d9320cf24ef19cebe upstream.
    
    The firmware notifies about interface changes through the IF event
    which has a NO_IF flag that means host can ignore the event. This
    behaviour was introduced in the driver by:
    
      commit 2ee8382fc6c763c76396a6aaff77a27089eed3aa
      Author: Arend van Spriel <arend@broadcom.com>

          brcmfmac: ignore IF event if firmware indicates it
    
    It turns out that the IF event for the P2P_DEVICE also has this
    flag set, but the event should not be ignored in this scenario.
    The mentioned commit caused a regression in 3.12 kernel in creation
    of the P2P_DEVICE interface.

    sched: Fix unreleased llc_shared_mask bit during CPU hotplug
    
    commit 03bd4e1f7265548832a76e7919a81f3137c44fd1 upstream.
    
    The following bug can be triggered by hot adding and removing a large number of
    xen domain0's vcpus repeatedly:
    
            BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000004 IP: [..] find_busiest_group
            PGD 5a9d5067 PUD 13067 PMD 0

            vfs_write
            SyS_write
            system_call_fastpath
    
    Last level cache shared mask is built during CPU up and the
    build_sched_domain() routine takes advantage of it to setup
    the sched domain CPU topology.
    
    However, llc_shared_mask is not released during CPU disable,
    which leads to an invalid sched domainCPU topology.
    
    This patch fix it by releasing the llc_shared_mask correctly
    during CPU disable.
    
    Yasuaki also reported that this can happen on real hardware:
    
      https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/7/22/1018
    
    His case is here:
    
            ==
            Here is an example on my system.
            My system has 4 sockets and each socket has 15 cores and HT is
            enabled. In this case, each core of sockes is numbered as
            follows:
    
                     | CPU#
            Socket#0 | 0-14 , 60-74
            Socket#1 | 15-29, 75-89
            Socket#2 | 30-44, 90-104
            Socket#3 | 45-59, 105-119
    
            Then llc_shared_mask of CPU#30 has 0x3fff80000001fffc0000000.
    
            It means that last level cache of Socket#2 is shared with
            CPU#30-44 and 90-104.
    
            When hot-removing socket#2 and #3, each core of sockets is
            numbered as follows:
    
                     | CPU#
            Socket#0 | 0-14 , 60-74
            Socket#1 | 15-29, 75-89
    
            But llc_shared_mask is not cleared. So llc_shared_mask of CPU#30
            remains having 0x3fff80000001fffc0000000.
    
            After that, when hot-adding socket#2 and #3, each core of
            sockets is numbered as follows:
    
                     | CPU#
            Socket#0 | 0-14 , 60-74
            Socket#1 | 15-29, 75-89
            Socket#2 | 30-59
            Socket#3 | 90-119
    
            Then llc_shared_mask of CPU#30 becomes
            0x3fff8000fffffffc0000000. It means that last level cache of
            Socket#2 is shared with CPU#30-59 and 90-104. So the mask has
            the wrong value.

    mm: softdirty: keep bit when zapping file pte
    
    commit dbab31aa2ceec2d201966fa0b552f151310ba5f4 upstream.
    
    This fixes the same bug as b43790eedd31 ("mm: softdirty: don't forget to
    save file map softdiry bit on unmap") and 9aed8614af5a ("mm/memory.c:
    don't forget to set softdirty on file mapped fault") where the return
    value of pte_*mksoft_dirty was being ignored.
    
    To be sure that no other pte/pmd "mk" function return values were being
    ignored, I annotated the functions in arch/x86/include/asm/pgtable.h
    with __must_check and rebuilt.
    
    The userspace effect of this bug is that the softdirty mark might be
    lost if a file mapped pte get zapped.

    commit d4a5fca592b9ab52b90bb261a90af3c8f53be011 upstream.
    
    Since commit 4590685546a3 ("mm/sl[aou]b: Common alignment code"), the
    "ralign" automatic variable in __kmem_cache_create() may be used as
    uninitialized.
    
    The proper alignment defaults to BYTES_PER_WORD and can be overridden by
    SLAB_RED_ZONE or the alignment specified by the caller.

    ocfs2/dlm: do not get resource spinlock if lockres is new
    
    commit 5760a97c7143c208fa3a8f8cad0ed7dd672ebd28 upstream.
    
    There is a deadlock case which reported by Guozhonghua:
      https://oss.oracle.com/pipermail/ocfs2-devel/2014-September/010079.html
    
    This case is caused by &res->spinlock and &dlm->master_lock
    misordering in different threads.
    
    It was introduced by commit 8d400b81cc83 ("ocfs2/dlm: Clean up refmap
    helpers").  Since lockres is new, it doesn't not require the
    &res->spinlock.  So remove it.

    nilfs2: fix data loss with mmap()
    
    commit 56d7acc792c0d98f38f22058671ee715ff197023 upstream.
    
    This bug leads to reproducible silent data loss, despite the use of
    msync(), sync() and a clean unmount of the file system.  It is easily
    reproducible with the following script:
    
      ----------------[BEGIN SCRIPT]--------------------
      mkfs.nilfs2 -f /dev/sdb
      mount /dev/sdb /mnt
    
      dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=30 of=/mnt/testfile
    
      umount /mnt
      mount /dev/sdb /mnt
      CHECKSUM_BEFORE="$(md5sum /mnt/testfile)"
    
      /root/mmaptest/mmaptest /mnt/testfile 30 10 5
    
      sync
      CHECKSUM_AFTER="$(md5sum /mnt/testfile)"
      umount /mnt
      mount /dev/sdb /mnt
      CHECKSUM_AFTER_REMOUNT="$(md5sum /mnt/testfile)"
      umount /mnt
    
      echo "BEFORE MMAP:\t$CHECKSUM_BEFORE"
      echo "AFTER MMAP:\t$CHECKSUM_AFTER"
      echo "AFTER REMOUNT:\t$CHECKSUM_AFTER_REMOUNT"
      ----------------[END SCRIPT]--------------------
    
    The mmaptest tool looks something like this (very simplified, with
    error checking removed):
    
      ----------------[BEGIN mmaptest]--------------------
      data = mmap(NULL, file_size - file_offset, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                  MAP_SHARED, fd, file_offset);
    
      for (i = 0; i < write_count; ++i) {
            memcpy(data + i * 4096, buf, sizeof(buf));
            msync(data, file_size - file_offset, MS_SYNC))
      }
      ----------------[END mmaptest]--------------------
    
    The output of the script looks something like this:
    
      BEFORE MMAP:    281ed1d5ae50e8419f9b978aab16de83  /mnt/testfile
      AFTER MMAP:     6604a1c31f10780331a6850371b3a313  /mnt/testfile
      AFTER REMOUNT:  281ed1d5ae50e8419f9b978aab16de83  /mnt/testfile
    
    So it is clear, that the changes done using mmap() do not survive a
    remount.  This can be reproduced a 100% of the time.  The problem was
    introduced in commit 136e8770cd5d ("nilfs2: fix issue of
    nilfs_set_page_dirty() for page at EOF boundary").
    
    If the page was read with mpage_readpage() or mpage_readpages() for
    example, then it has no buffers attached to it.  In that case
    page_has_buffers(page) in nilfs_set_page_dirty() will be false.
    Therefore nilfs_set_file_dirty() is never called and the pages are never
    collected and never written to disk.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by also calling nilfs_set_file_dirty() if the
    page has no buffers attached to it.

    integers, it is not translation invariant, meaning that we do not have
    "b <= c" iff "a+b <= a+c" for all a,b,c.
    
    This means that it is always wrong to try to boil down the relationship
    between two longs to a question about the sign of their difference,
    because the resulting relation [a LEQ b iff a-b <= 0] is neither
    anti-symmetric or transitive.  The former is due to -LONG_MIN==LONG_MIN
    (take any two a,b with a-b = LONG_MIN; then a LEQ b and b LEQ a, but a !=
    b).  The latter can either be seen observing that x LEQ x+1 for all x,
    implying x LEQ x+1 LEQ x+2 ...  LEQ x-1 LEQ x; or more directly with the
    simple example a=LONG_MIN, b=0, c=1, for which a-b < 0, b-c < 0, but a-c >
    0.
    
    Note that it makes absolutely no difference that a transmogrying bijection
    has been applied before the comparison is done.  In fact, had the
    obfuscation not been done, one could probably not observe the bug
    (assuming all values being compared always lie in one half of the address
    space, the mathematical value of a-b is always representable in a long).
    As it stands, one can easily obtain three file descriptors exhibiting the
    non-transitivity of kcmp().
    
    Side note 1: I can't see that ensuring the MSB of the multiplier is
    set serves any purpose other than obfuscating the obfuscating code.

    eventpoll: fix uninitialized variable in epoll_ctl
    
    commit c680e41b3a2e944185c74bf60531e3d316d3ecc4 upstream.
    
    When calling epoll_ctl with operation EPOLL_CTL_DEL, structure epds is
    not initialized but ep_take_care_of_epollwakeup reads its event field.
    When this unintialized field has EPOLLWAKEUP bit set, a capability check
    is done for CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND in ep_take_care_of_epollwakeup.  This
    produces unexpected messages in the audit log, such as (on a system
    running SELinux):
    
        type=AVC msg=audit(1408212798.866:410): avc:  denied

    ("arch=c000003e syscall=233 a1=2" means "epoll_ctl(op=EPOLL_CTL_DEL)")
    
    Remove use of epds in epoll_ctl when op == EPOLL_CTL_DEL.

    usb: dwc3: core: fix order of PM runtime calls
    
    commit fed33afce0eda44a46ae24d93aec1b5198c0bac4 upstream.
    
    Currently, we disable pm_runtime before all register
    accesses are done, this is dangerous and might lead
    to abort exceptions due to the driver trying to access
    a register which is clocked by a clock which was long
    gated.
    
    Fix that by moving pm_runtime_put_sync() and pm_runtime_disable()
    as the last thing we do before returning from our ->remove()

    lockdep: Revert lockdep check in raw_seqcount_begin()
    
    commit 22fdcf02f6e80d64a927f702dd9d631a927d87d4 upstream.
    
    This commit reverts the addition of lockdep checking to raw_seqcount_begin
    for the following reasons:
    
     1) It violates the naming convention that raw_* functions should not
        do lockdep checks (a convention that is also followed by the other
        raw_*_seqcount_begin functions).
    
     2) raw_seqcount_begin does not spin, so it can only be part of an ABBA
        deadlock in very special circumstances (for instance if a lock
        is held across the entire raw_seqcount_begin()+read_seqcount_retry()
        loop while also being taken inside the write_seqcount protected area).
    
     3) It is causing false positives with some existing callers, and there
        is no non-lockdep alternative for those callers to use.
    
    None of the three existing callers (__d_lookup_rcu, netdev_get_name, and
    the NFS state code) appear to use the function in a manner that is ABBA
    deadlock prone.

    alpha2 is defined as 2-chars array, but is used in multiple
    places as string (e.g. with nla_put_string calls), which

    Solve it by simply adding an extra char for the NULL

    If pcpu_map_pages() fails midway, it unmaps the already mapped pages.
    Currently, it doesn't flush tlb after the partial unmapping.  This may
    be okay in most cases as the established mapping hasn't been used at
    that point but it can go wrong and when it goes wrong it'd be

    percpu: fix pcpu_alloc_pages() failure path
    
    commit f0d279654dea22b7a6ad34b9334aee80cda62cde upstream.
    
    When pcpu_alloc_pages() fails midway, pcpu_free_pages() is invoked to
    free what has already been allocated.  The invocation is across the
    whole requested range and pcpu_free_pages() will try to free all
    non-NULL pages; unfortunately, this is incorrect as
    pcpu_get_pages_and_bitmap(), unlike what its comment suggests, doesn't
    clear the pages array and thus the array may have entries from the
    previous invocations making the partial failure path free incorrect
    pages.
    
    Fix it by open-coding the partial freeing of the already allocated
    pages.

    Currently, only SMP system free the percpu allocation info.
    Uniprocessor system should free it too. For example, one x86 UML

    commit c01206796139e2b1feb7539bc72174fef1c6dc6e upstream.
    
    We are getting more and more reports about LG laptops not having
    functioning keyboard if we try to deactivate keyboard during probe.
    Given that having keyboard deactivated is merely "nice to have"
    instead of a hard requirement for probing, let's disable it on all
    LG boxes instead of trying to hunt down particular models.
    
    This change is prompted by patches trying to add "LG Electronics"/"ROCKY"
    and "LG Electronics"/"LW60-F27B" to the DMI list.

    ForcePads are found on HP EliteBook 1040 laptops. They lack any kind of
    physical buttons, instead they generate primary button click when user
    presses somewhat hard on the surface of the touchpad. Unfortunately they
    also report primary button click whenever there are 2 or more contacts
    on the pad, messing up all multi-finger gestures (2-finger scrolling,
    multi-finger tapping, etc). To cope with this behavior we introduce a
    delay (currently 50 msecs) in reporting primary press in case more
    contacts appear.

    dm crypt: fix access beyond the end of allocated space
    
    commit d49ec52ff6ddcda178fc2476a109cf1bd1fa19ed upstream.
    
    The DM crypt target accesses memory beyond allocated space resulting in
    a crash on 32 bit x86 systems.
    
    This bug is very old (it dates back to 2.6.25 commit 3a7f6c990ad04 "dm
    crypt: use async crypto").  However, this bug was masked by the fact
    that kmalloc rounds the size up to the next power of two.  This bug
    wasn't exposed until 3.17-rc1 commit 298a9fa08a ("dm crypt: use per-bio
    data").  By switching to using per-bio data there was no longer any
    padding beyond the end of a dm-crypt allocated memory block.
    
    To minimize allocation overhead dm-crypt puts several structures into one
    block allocated with kmalloc.  The block holds struct ablkcipher_request,
    cipher-specific scratch pad (crypto_ablkcipher_reqsize(any_tfm(cc))),
    struct dm_crypt_request and an initialization vector.
    
    The variable dmreq_start is set to offset of struct dm_crypt_request
    within this memory block.  dm-crypt allocates the block with this size:
    cc->dmreq_start + sizeof(struct dm_crypt_request) + cc->iv_size.
    
    When accessing the initialization vector, dm-crypt uses the function
    iv_of_dmreq, which performs this calculation: ALIGN((unsigned long)(dmreq
    + 1), crypto_ablkcipher_alignmask(any_tfm(cc)) + 1).
    
    dm-crypt allocated "cc->iv_size" bytes beyond the end of dm_crypt_request
    structure.  However, when dm-crypt accesses the initialization vector, it
    takes a pointer to the end of dm_crypt_request, aligns it, and then uses
    it as the initialization vector.  If the end of dm_crypt_request is not
    aligned on a crypto_ablkcipher_alignmask(any_tfm(cc)) boundary the
    alignment causes the initialization vector to point beyond the allocated
    space.
    
    Fix this bug by calculating the variable iv_size_padding and adding it
    to the allocated size.
    
    Also correct the alignment of dm_crypt_request.  struct dm_crypt_request
    is specific to dm-crypt (it isn't used by the crypto subsystem at all),
    so it is aligned on __alignof__(struct dm_crypt_request).
    
    Also align per_bio_data_size on ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN, so that it is
    aligned as if the block was allocated with kmalloc.

    dm cache: fix race causing dirty blocks to be marked as clean
    
    commit 40aa978eccec61347cd47b97c598df49acde8be5 upstream.
    
    When a writeback or a promotion of a block is completed, the cell of
    that block is removed from the prison, the block is marked as clean, and
    the clear_dirty() callback of the cache policy is called.
    
    Unfortunately, performing those actions in this order allows an incoming
    new write bio for that block to come in before clearing the dirty status
    is completed and therefore possibly causing one of these two scenarios:
    
    Scenario A:
    
    Thread 1                      Thread 2
    cell_defer()                  .
    - cell removed from prison    .
    - detained bios queued        .
    .                             incoming write bio
    .                             remapped to cache
    .                             set_dirty() called,
    .                               but block already dirty
    .                               => it does nothing
    clear_dirty()                 .
    - block marked clean          .
    - policy clear_dirty() called .
    
    Result: Block is marked clean even though it is actually dirty. No
    writeback will occur.
    
    Scenario B:
    
    Thread 1                      Thread 2
    cell_defer()                  .
    - cell removed from prison    .
    - detained bios queued        .
    clear_dirty()                 .
    - block marked clean          .
    .                             incoming write bio
    .                             remapped to cache
    .                             set_dirty() called
    .                             - block marked dirty
    .                             - policy set_dirty() called
    - policy clear_dirty() called .
    
    Result: Block is properly marked as dirty, but policy thinks it is clean
    and therefore never asks us to writeback it.
    This case is visible in "dmsetup status" dirty block count (which
    normally decreases to 0 on a quiet device).
    
    Fix these issues by calling clear_dirty() before calling cell_defer().
    Incoming bios for that block will then be detained in the cell and
    released only after clear_dirty() has completed, so the race will not
    occur.
    
    Found by inspecting the code after noticing spurious dirty counts
    (scenario B).

    futex: Unlock hb->lock in futex_wait_requeue_pi() error path
    
    commit 13c42c2f43b19aab3195f2d357db00d1e885eaa8 upstream.
    
    futex_wait_requeue_pi() calls futex_wait_setup(). If
    futex_wait_setup() succeeds it returns with hb->lock held and
    preemption disabled. Now the sanity check after this does:
    
            if (match_futex(&q.key, &key2)) {
                    ret = -EINVAL;
                    goto out_put_keys;
            }
    
    which releases the keys but does not release hb->lock.
    
    So we happily return to user space with hb->lock held and therefor
    preemption disabled.
    
    Unlock hb->lock before taking the exit route.

    workqueue: apply __WQ_ORDERED to create_singlethread_workqueue()
    
    commit e09c2c295468476a239d13324ce9042ec4de05eb upstream.
    
    create_singlethread_workqueue() is a compat interface for single
    threaded workqueue which maps to ordered workqueue w/ rescuer in the
    current implementation.  create_singlethread_workqueue() currently
    implemented by invoking alloc_workqueue() w/ appropriate parameters.
    
    8719dceae2f9 ("workqueue: reject adjusting max_active or applying
    attrs to ordered workqueues") introduced __WQ_ORDERED to protect
    ordered workqueues against dynamic attribute changes which can break
    ordering guarantees but forgot to apply it to
    create_singlethread_workqueue().  This in itself is okay as nobody
    currently uses dynamic attribute change on workqueues created with
    create_singlethread_workqueue().
    
    However, 4c16bd327c ("workqueue: implement NUMA affinity for unbound
    workqueues") broke singlethreaded guarantee for ordered workqueues
    through allocating a separate pool_workqueue on each NUMA node by
    default.  A later change 8a2b75384444 ("workqueue: fix ordered
    workqueues in NUMA setups") fixed it by allocating only one global
    pool_workqueue if __WQ_ORDERED is set.
    
    Combined, the __WQ_ORDERED omission in create_singlethread_workqueue()
    became critical breaking its single threadedness and ordering
    guarantee.
    
    Let's make create_singlethread_workqueue() wrap
    alloc_ordered_workqueue() instead so that it inherits __WQ_ORDERED and
    can implicitly track future ordered_workqueue changes.
    
    v2: I missed that __WQ_ORDERED now protects against pwq splitting
        across NUMA nodes and incorrectly described the patch as a
        nice-to-have fix to protect against future dynamic attribute
        usages.  Oleg pointed out that this is actually a critical
        breakage due to 8a2b75384444 ("workqueue: fix ordered workqueues
        in NUMA setups").

    iwlwifi: mvm: treat EAPOLs like mgmt frames wrt rate
    
    commit aa11bbf3df026d6b1c6b528bef634fd9de7c2619 upstream.
    
    Using the LQ table which is initially set according to
    the rssi could lead to EAPOLs being sent in high legacy
    rates like 54mbps.
    It's better to avoid sending EAPOLs in high rates as it reduces
    the chances of a successful 4-Way handshake.
    Avoid this and treat them like other mgmt frames which would
    initially get sent at the basic rate.

    iwlwifi: mvm: fix endianity issues with Smart Fifo commands
    
    commit 86974bff066dd8b98be46d7c7d3aba89034f0833 upstream.
    
    This code was broken on big endian systems. Sparse didn't
    catch the bug since the firmware command was not tagged as
    little endian.
    Fix the bug for big endian systems and tag the field in the
    firmware command to prevent such issues in the future.

    SCSI: libiscsi: fix potential buffer overrun in __iscsi_conn_send_pdu
    
    commit db9bfd64b14a3a8f1868d2164518fdeab1b26ad1 upstream.
    
    This patches fixes a potential buffer overrun in __iscsi_conn_send_pdu.
    This function is used by iscsi drivers and userspace to send iscsi PDUs/
    commands. For login commands, we have a set buffer size. For all other
    commands we do not support data buffers.

    commit 8ae757d09c45102b347a1bc2867f54ffc1ab8fda upstream.
    
    In iscsi_copy_param_list() a failed iscsi_param_list memory allocation
    currently invokes iscsi_release_param_list() to cleanup, and will promptly
    trigger a NULL pointer dereference.

    disconnected_handler is invoked on several CM events (such

    multiple  events can occur while before isert_free_conn is

    x86/kaslr: Avoid the setup_data area when picking location
    
    commit 0cacbfbeb5077b63d5d3cf6df88b14ac12ad584b upstream.
    
    The KASLR location-choosing logic needs to avoid the setup_data
    list memory areas as well. Without this, it would be possible to
    have the ASLR position stomp on the memory, ultimately causing
    the boot to fail.

    Quote reply from Lv.zheng about the early ioremap slot usage in this case:
    
    """
    In early_efi_scroll_up(), 2 mapping entries will be used for the src/dst screen buffer.
    In drivers/acpi/acpica/tbutils.c, we've improved the early table loading code in acpi_tb_parse_root_table().
    We now need 2 mapping entries:
    1. One mapping entry is used for RSDT table mapping. Each RSDT entry contains an address for another ACPI table.
    2. For each entry in RSDP, we need another mapping entry to map the table to perform necessary check/override before installing it.
    
    When acpi_tb_parse_root_table() prints something through EFI earlyprintk console, we'll have 4 mapping entries used.
    The current 4 slots setting of early_ioremap() seems to be too small for such a use case.

    Thus increase the slot to 8 in this patch to fix this issue.

    x86/xen: don't copy bogus duplicate entries into kernel page tables
    
    commit 0b5a50635fc916cf46e3de0b819a61fc3f17e7ee upstream.
    
    When RANDOMIZE_BASE (KASLR) is enabled; or the sum of all loaded
    modules exceeds 512 MiB, then loading modules fails with a warning
    (and hence a vmalloc allocation failure) because the PTEs for the
    newly-allocated vmalloc address space are not zero.
    
      WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 494 at linux/mm/vmalloc.c:128
               vmap_page_range_noflush+0x2a1/0x360()
    
    This is caused by xen_setup_kernel_pagetables() copying
    level2_kernel_pgt into level2_fixmap_pgt, overwriting many non-present
    entries.
    
    Without KASLR, the normal kernel image size only covers the first half
    of level2_kernel_pgt and module space starts after that.
    
    L4[511]->level3_kernel_pgt[510]->level2_kernel_pgt[  0..255]->kernel
                                                      [256..511]->module
                              [511]->level2_fixmap_pgt[  0..505]->module
    
    This allows 512 MiB of of module vmalloc space to be used before
    having to use the corrupted level2_fixmap_pgt entries.
    
    With KASLR enabled, the kernel image uses the full PUD range of 1G and
    module space starts in the level2_fixmap_pgt. So basically:
    
    L4[511]->level3_kernel_pgt[510]->level2_kernel_pgt[0..511]->kernel
                              [511]->level2_fixmap_pgt[0..505]->module
    
    And now no module vmalloc space can be used without using the corrupt
    level2_fixmap_pgt entries.
    
    Fix this by properly converting the level2_fixmap_pgt entries to MFNs,
    and setting level1_fixmap_pgt as read-only.
    
    A number of comments were also using the the wrong L3 offset for
    level2_kernel_pgt.  These have been corrected.

    xen/manage: Always freeze/thaw processes when suspend/resuming
    
    commit 61a734d305e16944b42730ef582a7171dc733321 upstream.
    
    Always freeze processes when suspending and thaw processes when resuming
    to prevent a race noticeable with HVM guests.
    
    This prevents a deadlock where the khubd kthread (which is designed to
    be freezable) acquires a usb device lock and then tries to allocate
    memory which requires the disk which hasn't been resumed yet.
    Meanwhile, the xenwatch thread deadlocks waiting for the usb device
    lock.
    
    Freezing processes fixes this because the khubd thread is only thawed
    after the xenwatch thread finishes resuming all the devices.

    cgroup: fix unbalanced locking
    
    commit eb4aec84d6bdf98d00cedb41c18000f7a31e648a upstream.
    
    cgroup_pidlist_start() holds cgrp->pidlist_mutex and then calls
    pidlist_array_load(), and cgroup_pidlist_stop() releases the mutex.
    
    It is wrong that we release the mutex in the failure path in

    no matter if cgroup_pidlist_start() returns errno or not.

    regmap: Fix handling of volatile registers for format_write() chips
    
    commit 5844a8b9d98ec11ce1d77610daacf3f0a0e14715 upstream.
    
    A previous over-zealous factorisation of code means that we only treat
    registers as volatile if they are readable. For most devices this is fine
    since normally most registers can be read and volatility implies
    readability but for format_write() devices where there is no readback from
    the hardware and we use volatility to mean simply uncacheability this means
    that we end up treating all registers as cacheble.
    
    A bigger refactoring of the code to clarify this is in order but as a fix
    make a minimal change and only check readability when checking volatility
    if there is no format_write() operation defined for the device.

    memblock, memhotplug: fix wrong type in memblock_find_in_range_node().
    
    commit 0cfb8f0c3e21e36d4a6e472e4c419d58ba848698 upstream.
    
    In memblock_find_in_range_node(), we defined ret as int.  But it should
    be phys_addr_t because it is used to store the return value from
    __memblock_find_range_bottom_up().
    
    The bug has not been triggered because when allocating low memory near
    the kernel end, the "int ret" won't turn out to be negative.  When we
    started to allocate memory on other nodes, and the "int ret" could be
    minus.  Then the kernel will panic.
    
    A simple way to reproduce this: comment out the following code in
    numa_init(),
    
            memblock_set_bottom_up(false);
    
    and the kernel won't boot.

    Commit 46394fd01 (ACPI / hotplug: Move container-specific code out of

    because "add" uevents are now generated for them automatically when
    container system devices are registered.  However, there are user
    space tools that need to be notified when the container and all of
    its children have been enumerated, which doesn't happen any more.
    
    For this reason, add a mechanism allowing "online" uevents to be
    generated for ACPI containers after enumerating the container along
    with all of its children.

    ACPICA: Update to GPIO region handler interface.
    
    commit 75ec6e55f1384548311a13ce4fcb39c516053314 upstream.
    
    Changes to correct several GPIO issues:
    
    1) The update_rule in a GPIO field definition is now ignored;
    a read-modify-write operation is never performed for GPIO fields.
    (Internally, this means that the field assembly/disassembly
    code is completely bypassed for GPIO.)
    
    2) The Address parameter passed to a GPIO region handler is
    now the bit offset of the field from a previous Connection()
    operator. Thus, it becomes a "Pin Number Index" into the
    Connection() resource descriptor.
    
    3) The bit_width parameter passed to a GPIO region handler is
    now the exact bit width of the GPIO field. Thus, it can be
    interpreted as "number of pins".
    
    Overall, we can now say that the region handler interface
    to GPIO handlers is a raw "bit/pin" addressed interface, not
    a byte-addressed interface like the system_memory handler interface.

    MIPS: mcount: Adjust stack pointer for static trace in MIPS32
    
    commit 8a574cfa2652545eb95595d38ac2a0bb501af0ae upstream.
    
    Every mcount() call in the MIPS 32-bit kernel is done as follows:
    
    [...]
    move at, ra
    jal _mcount
    addiu sp, sp, -8
    [...]
    
    but upon returning from the mcount() function, the stack pointer
    is not adjusted properly. This is explained in details in 58b69401c797
    (MIPS: Function tracer: Fix broken function tracing).
    
    Commit ad8c396936e3 ("MIPS: Unbreak function tracer for 64-bit kernel.)
    fixed the stack manipulation for 64-bit but it didn't fix it completely
    for MIPS32.

    include/linux/dynamic_debug.h. There might be other ways for it to
    get indirectly included.
    
    We can't add the include directly in xz_dec_stream.c as some
    architectures might want to use a different version for the boot/
    directory (see for example arch/x86/boot/string.h).

    ARM: 8148/1: flush TLS and thumbee register state during exec
    
    commit fbfb872f5f417cea48760c535e0ff027c88b507a upstream.
    
    The TPIDRURO and TPIDRURW registers need to be flushed during exec;
    otherwise TLS information is potentially leaked.  TPIDRURO in
    particular needs careful treatment.  Since flush_thread basically
    needs the same code used to set the TLS in arm_syscall, pull that into
    a common set_tls helper in tls.h and use it in both places.
    
    Similarly, TEEHBR needs to be cleared during exec as well.  Clearing
    its save slot in thread_info isn't right as there is no guarantee
    that a thread switch will occur before the new program runs.  Just
    setting the register directly is sufficient.

    ARM: 8133/1: use irq_set_affinity with force=false when migrating irqs
    
    commit a040803a9d6b8c1876d3487a5cb69602ebcbb82c upstream.
    
    Since commit 1dbfa187dad ("ARM: irq migration: force migration off CPU
    going down") the ARM interrupt migration code on cpu offline calls
    irqchip.irq_set_affinity() with the argument force=true. At the point
    of this change the argument had no effect because it was not used by
    any interrupt chip driver and there was no semantics defined.
    
    This changed with commit 01f8fa4f01d8 ("genirq: Allow forcing cpu
    affinity of interrupts") which made the force argument useful to route
    interrupts to not yet online cpus without checking the target cpu
    against the cpu online mask. The following commit ffde1de64012
    ("irqchip: gic: Support forced affinity setting") implemented this for
    the GIC interrupt controller.
    
    As a consequence the ARM cpu offline irq migration fails if CPU0 is
    offlined, because CPU0 is still set in the affinity mask and the
    validataion against cpu online mask is skipped to the force argument
    being true. The following first_cpu(mask) selection always selects
    CPU0 as the target.
    
    Solve the issue by calling irq_set_affinity() with force=false from
    the CPU offline irq migration code so the GIC driver validates the
    affinity mask against CPU online mask and therefore removes CPU0 from
    the possible target candidates.
    
    Tested on TC2 hotpluging CPU0 in and out. Without this patch the system
    locks up as the IRQs are not migrated away from CPU0.

    ARM: dts: DRA7: fix interrupt-cells for GPIO
    
    commit e49d519c456f4fb6f4a0473bc04ba30bb805fce5 upstream.
    
    GPIO modules are also interrupt sources. However, they require both the
    GPIO number and IRQ type to function properly.
    
    By declaring that GPIO uses interrupt-cells=<1>, we essentially do not
    allow users of the nodes to use the interrupt property appropritely.
    
    With this change, the following now works:
    
    interrupt-parent = <&gpio6>;
    interrupts = <5 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;

    ARM: 8128/1: abort: don't clear the exclusive monitors
    
    commit 85868313177700d20644263a782351262d2aff84 upstream.
    
    The ARMv6 and ARMv7 early abort handlers clear the exclusive monitors
    upon entry to the kernel, but this is redundant:
    
      - We clear the monitors on every exception return since commit
        200b812d0084 ("Clear the exclusive monitor when returning from an
        exception"), so this is not necessary to ensure the monitors are
        cleared before returning from a fault handler.
    
      - Any dummy STREX will target a temporary scratch area in memory, and
        may succeed or fail without corrupting useful data. Its status value
        will not be used.
    
      - Any other STREX in the kernel must be preceded by an LDREX, which
        will initialise the monitors consistently and will not depend on the
        earlier state of the monitors.
    
    Therefore we have no reason to care about the initial state of the
    exclusive monitors when a data abort is taken, and clearing the monitors
    prior to exception return (as we already do) is sufficient.
    
    This patch removes the redundant clearing of the exclusive monitors from
    the early abort handlers.

    NFSv4: nfs4_state_manager() vs. nfs_server_remove_lists()
    
    commit 080af20cc945d110f9912d01cf6b66f94a375b8d upstream.
    
    There is a race between nfs4_state_manager() and
    nfs_server_remove_lists() that happens during a nfsv3 mount.
    
    The v3 mount notices there is already a supper block so
    nfs_server_remove_lists() called which uses the nfs_client_lock
    spin lock to synchronize access to the client list.
    
    At the same time nfs4_state_manager() is running through
    the client list looking for work to do, using the same
    lock. When nfs4_state_manager() wins the race to the
    list, a v3 client pointer is found and not ignored
    properly which causes the panic.
    
    Moving some protocol checks before the state checking
    avoids the panic.

    USB: EHCI: unlink QHs even after the controller has stopped
    
    commit 7312b5ddd47fee2356baa78c5516ef8e04eed452 upstream.
    
    Old code in ehci-hcd tries to expedite disabling endpoints after the
    controller has stopped, by destroying the endpoint's associated QH
    without first unlinking the QH.  This was necessary back when the
    driver wasn't so careful about keeping track of the controller's
    state.
    
    But now we are careful about it, and the driver knows that when the
    controller isn't running, no unlinking delay is needed.  Furthermore,
    skipping the unlink step will trigger a BUG() in qh_destroy() when the
    preceding QH is released, because the link pointer will be non-NULL.
    
    Removing the lines that skip the unlinking step and go directly to
    QH_STATE_IDLE fixes the problem.

    USB: storage: Add quirks for Entrega/Xircom USB to SCSI converters
    
    commit c80b4495c61636edc58fe1ce300f09f24db28e10 upstream.
    
    This patch adds quirks for Entrega Technologies (later Xircom PortGear) USB-
    SCSI converters. They use Shuttle Technology EUSB-01/EUSB-S1 chips. The
    US_FL_SCM_MULT_TARG quirk is needed to allow multiple devices on the SCSI
    chain to be accessed. Without it only the (single) device with SCSI ID 0
    can be used.
    
    The standalone converter sold by Entrega had model number U1-SC25. Xircom
    acquired Entrega and re-branded the product line PortGear. The PortGear USB
    to SCSI Converter (model PGSCSI) is internally identical to the Entrega
    product, but later models may use a different USB ID. The Entrega-branded
    units have USB ID 1645:0007, as does my Xircom PGSCSI, but the Windows and
    Macintosh drivers also support 085A:0028.
    
    Entrega also sold the "Mac USB Dock", which provides two USB ports, a Mac
    (8-pin mini-DIN) serial port and a SCSI port. It appears to the computer as
    a four-port hub, USB-serial, and USB-SCSI converters. The USB-SCSI part may
    have initially used the same ID as the standalone U1-SC25 (1645:0007), but
    later production used 085A:0026.
    
    My Xircom PortGear PGSCSI has bcdDevice=0x0100. Units with bcdDevice=0x0133
    probably also exist.
    
    This patch adds quirks for 1645:0007, 085A:0026 and 085A:0028. The Windows
    driver INF file also mentions 085A:0032 "PortStation SCSI Module", but I
    couldn't find any mention of that actually existing in the wild; perhaps it
    was cancelled before release?

    USB: storage: Add quirk for Ariston Technologies iConnect USB to SCSI adapter
    
    commit b6a3ed677991558ce09046397a7c4d70530d15b3 upstream.
    
    Hi,
    
    The Ariston Technologies iConnect 025 and iConnect 050 (also known as e.g.
    iSCSI-50) are SCSI-USB converters which use Shuttle Technology/SCM
    Microsystems chips. Only the connectors differ; both have the same USB ID.
    The US_FL_SCM_MULT_TARG quirk is required to use SCSI devices with ID other
    than 0.
    
    I don't have one of these, but based on the other entries for Shuttle/
    SCM-based converters this patch is very likely correct. I used 0x0000 and
    0x9999 for bcdDeviceMin and bcdDeviceMax because I'm not sure which
    bcdDevice value the products use.

    storage: Add single-LUN quirk for Jaz USB Adapter
    
    commit c66f1c62e85927357e7b3f4c701614dcb5c498a2 upstream.
    
    The Iomega Jaz USB Adapter is a SCSI-USB converter cable. The hardware
    seems to be identical to e.g. the Microtech XpressSCSI, using a Shuttle/
    SCM chip set. However its firmware restricts it to only work with Jaz
    drives.
    
    On connecting the cable a message like this appears four times in the log:
     reset full speed USB device number 4 using uhci_hcd
    
    That's non-fatal but the US_FL_SINGLE_LUN quirk fixes it.

    xhci: fix oops when xhci resumes from hibernate with hw lpm capable devices
    
    commit 96044694b8511bc2b04df0776b4ba295cfe005c0 upstream.
    
    Resuming from hibernate (S4) will restart and re-initialize xHC.
    The device contexts are freed and will be re-allocated later during device reset.
    
    Usb core will disable link pm in device resume before device reset, which will
    try to change the max exit latency, accessing the device contexts before they are re-allocated.
    
    There is no need to zero (disable) the max exit latency when disabling hw lpm
    for a freshly re-initialized xHC. So check that device context exists before
    doing anything. The max exit latency will be set again after device reset when usb core
    enables the link pm.

    usb: host: xhci: fix compliance mode workaround
    
    commit 96908589a8b2584b1185f834d365f5cc360e8226 upstream.
    
    Commit 71c731a (usb: host: xhci: Fix Compliance Mode
    on SN65LVP3502CP Hardware) implemented a workaround
    for a known issue with Texas Instruments' USB 3.0
    redriver IC but it left a condition where any xHCI
    host would be taken out of reset if port was placed
    in compliance mode and there was no device connected
    to the port.
    
    That condition would trigger a fake connection to a
    non-existent device so that usbcore would trigger a
    warm reset of the port, thus taking the link out of
    reset.
    
    This has the side-effect of preventing any xHCI host
    connected to a Linux machine from starting and running
    the USB 3.0 Electrical Compliance Suite because the
    port will mysteriously taken out of compliance mode
    and, thus, xHCI won't step through the necessary
    compliance patterns for link validation.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by just adding a missing
    check for XHCI_COMP_MODE_QUIRK inside
    xhci_hub_report_usb3_link_state() when PORT_CAS isn't
    set.
    
    This patch should be backported to all kernels containing
    commit 71c731a.

    usb: phy: twl4030-usb: Fix regressions to runtime PM on omaps
    
    commit 96be39ab34b77c6f6f5cd6ae03aac6c6449ee5c4 upstream.
    
    Commit 30a70b026b4cd ("usb: musb: fix obex in g_nokia.ko causing kernel
    panic") attempted to fix runtime PM handling for PHYs that are on the
    I2C bus. Commit 3063a12be2b0 ("usb: musb: fix PHY power on/off") then
    changed things around to enable of PHYs that rely on runtime PM.
    
    These changes however broke idling of the PHY and causes at least
    100 mW extra power consumption on omaps, which is a lot with
    the idle power consumption being below 10 mW range on many devices.
    
    As calling phy_power_on/off from runtime PM calls in the USB
    causes complicated issues with I2C connected PHYs, let's just let
    the PHY do it's own runtime PM as needed. This leaves out the
    dependency between PHYs and USB controller drivers for runtime
    PM.
    
    Let's fix the regression for twl4030-usb by adding minimal runtime
    PM support. This allows idling the PHY on disconnect.
    
    Note that we are changing to use standard runtime PM handling
    for twl4030_phy_init() as that function just checks the state
    and does not initialize the PHY. The PHY won't get initialized
    until in twl4030_phy_power_on().

    usb: phy: twl4030-usb: Fix lost interrupts after ID pin goes down
    
    commit 85601b8d81e24ce9ae2d31e93f35468ab7616b18 upstream.
    
    Commit 249751f22380 ("usb: phy: twl4030-usb: poll for ID disconnect")
    added twl4030_id_workaround_work() to deal with lost interrupts
    after ID pin goes down. Looks like commit f1ddc24c9e33 ("usb: phy:
    twl4030-usb: remove *set_suspend* and *phy_init* ops") changed
    things around for the generic phy framework, and delayed work no
    longer got called except initially during boot.
    
    The PHY connect and disconnect interrupts for twl4030-usb are not
    working after disconnecting a USB-A cable from the board, and the
    deeper idle states for omap are blocked as the USB controller
    stays busy.
    
    The issue can be solved by calling delayed work from twl4030_usb_irq()
    when ID pin is down and the PHY is not asleep like we already do
    in twl4030_id_workaround_work().
    
    But as both twl4030_usb_irq() and twl4030_id_workaround_work()
    already do pretty much the same thing, let's call twl4030_usb_irq()
    from twl4030_id_workaround_work() instead of adding some more
    duplicate code. We also must call sysfs_notify() only when we have
    an interrupt and not from the delayed work as notified by
    Grazvydas Ignotas <notasas@gmail.com>.

    The PHY configuration is stored in an opaque "config" field, but when

    USB: sierra: avoid CDC class functions on "68A3" devices
    
    commit 049255f51644c1105775af228396d187402a5934 upstream.
    
    Sierra Wireless Direct IP devices using the 68A3 product ID
    can be configured for modes including a CDC ECM class function.
    The known example uses interface numbers 12 and 13 for the ECM
    control and data interfaces respectively, consistent with CDC
    MBIM function interface numbering on other Sierra devices.
    
    It seems cleaner to restrict this driver to the ff/ff/ff
    vendor specific interfaces rather than increasing the already
    long interface number blacklist.  This should be more future
    proof if Sierra adds more class functions using interface
    numbers not yet in the blacklist.

    Revert "USB: option,zte_ev: move most ZTE CDMA devices to zte_ev"
    
    commit 63a901c06e3c2c45bd601916fe04e870e9ccae1e upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 73228a0538a7 ("USB: option,zte_ev: move most ZTE
    CDMA devices to zte_ev").
    
    Move the IDs of the devices that were previously driven by the option
    driver back to that driver.
    
    As several users have reported, the zte_ev driver is causing random
    disconnects as well as reconnect failures.
    
    A closer analysis of the zte_ev setup code reveals that it consists of
    standard CDC requests (SET/GET_LINE_CODING and SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE)
    but unfortunately fails to get some of those right. In particular, as
    reported by Liu Lei, it fails to lower DTR/RTS on close. It also appears
    that the control requests lack the interface argument.
    
    Note that the zte_ev driver is based on code (once) distributed by ZTE
    that still appears to originally have been reverse-engineered and bolted
    onto the generic driver.
    
    Since line control is already handled properly by the option driver, and
    the SET/GET_LINE_CODING requests appears to be redundant (amounts to a
    SET 9600 8N1), this is a first step in ultimately removing the redundant
    zte_ev driver.
    
    Note that AC2726 had already been moved back to option, and that some
    IDs were in the device table of both drivers prior to the commit being
    reverted.

    USB: option: reduce interrupt-urb logging verbosity
    
    commit f0e4cba2534cd88476dff920727c81350130f3c5 upstream.
    
    Do not log normal interrupt-urb shutdowns as errors.
    
    The option driver has always been logging any nonzero interrupt-urb
    status as an error, including when the urb is killed during normal
    operation.
    
    Commit 9096f1fbba91 ("USB: usb_wwan: fix potential NULL-deref at
    resume") moved the interrupt urb submission from port probe and release
    to open and close, thus potentially increasing the number of these
    false-positive error messages dramatically.

    xtensa: fix TLBTEMP_BASE_2 region handling in fast_second_level_miss
    
    commit 7128039fe2dd3d59da9e4ffa036f3aaa3ba87b9f upstream.
    
    Current definition of TLBTEMP_BASE_2 is always 32K above the
    TLBTEMP_BASE_1, whereas fast_second_level_miss handler for the TLBTEMP
    region analyzes virtual address bit (PAGE_SHIFT + DCACHE_ALIAS_ORDER)
    to determine TLBTEMP region where the fault happened. The size of the
    TLBTEMP region is also checked incorrectly: not 64K, but twice data
    cache way size (whicht may as well be less than the instruction cache
    way size).
    
    Fix TLBTEMP_BASE_2 to be TLBTEMP_BASE_1 + data cache way size.
    Provide TLBTEMP_SIZE that is a greater of doubled data cache way size or
    the instruction cache way size, and use it to determine if the second
    level TLB miss occured in the TLBTEMP region.
    
    Practical occurence of page faults in the TLBTEMP area is extremely
    rare, this code can be tested by deletion of all w[di]tlb instructions
    in the tlbtemp_mapping region.

    drm/i915: Wait for vblank before enabling the TV encoder
    
    commit 7a98948f3b536ca9a077e84966ddc0e9f53726df upstream.
    
    The vblank waits in intel_tv_detect_type() are timing out for some
    reason. This is a regression caused removing seemingly useless vblank
    waits from the modeset seqeuence in:

        drm/i915: Kill vblank waits after pipe enable on gmch platforms
    
    So it turns out they weren't all entirely useless. Apparently the pipe
    has to go through one full frame before we enable the TV port. Add a
    vblank wait to intel_enable_tv() to make sure that happens.
    
    Another approach was attempted by placing the vblank wait just after
    enabling the port. The theory behind that attempt was that we need to
    let the port stay enabled for one full frame before disabling it again
    during load detection. But that didn't work, and we definitely must
    have the vblank wait before enabling the port.

    drm/i915: Remove bogus __init annotation from DMI callbacks
    
    commit bbe1c2740d3a25aa1dbe5d842d2ff09cddcdde0a upstream.
    
    The __init annotations for the DMI callback functions are wrong as this
    code can be called even after the module has been initialized, e.g. like
    this:
    
      # echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:02.0/remove
      # modprobe i915
      # echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan
    
    The first command will remove the PCI device from the kernel's device
    list so the second command won't see it right away. But as it registers
    a PCI driver it'll see it on the third command. If the system happens to
    match one of the DMI table entries we'll try to call a function in long
    released memory and generate an Oops, at best.
    
    Fix this by removing the bogus annotation.
    
    Modpost should have caught that one but it ignores section reference
    mismatches from the .rodata section. :/

    Commit "HID: logitech: perform bounds checking on device_id early
    enough" unfortunately leaks some errors to dmesg which are not real
    ones:
    - if the report is not a DJ one, then there is not point in checking
      the device_id
    - the receiver (index 0) can also receive some notifications which
      can be safely ignored given the current implementation
    
    Move out the test regarding the report_id and also discards
    printing errors when the receiver got notified.

    cfq-iosched: Fix wrong children_weight calculation
    
    commit e15693ef18e13e3e6bffe891fe140f18b8ff6d07 upstream.
    
    cfq_group_service_tree_add() is applying new_weight at the beginning of
    the function via cfq_update_group_weight().
    This actually allows weight to change between adding it to and subtracting
    it from children_weight, and triggers WARN_ON_ONCE() in
    cfq_group_service_tree_del(), or even causes oops by divide error during
    vfr calculation in cfq_group_service_tree_add().
    
    The detailed scenario is as follows:
    1. Create blkio cgroups X and Y as a child of X.
       Set X's weight to 500 and perform some I/O to apply new_weight.
       This X's I/O completes before starting Y's I/O.
    2. Y starts I/O and cfq_group_service_tree_add() is called with Y.
    3. cfq_group_service_tree_add() walks up the tree during children_weight
       calculation and adds parent X's weight (500) to children_weight of root.
       children_weight becomes 500.
    4. Set X's weight to 1000.
    5. X starts I/O and cfq_group_service_tree_add() is called with X.
    6. cfq_group_service_tree_add() applies its new_weight (1000).
    7. I/O of Y completes and cfq_group_service_tree_del() is called with Y.
    8. I/O of X completes and cfq_group_service_tree_del() is called with X.
    9. cfq_group_service_tree_del() subtracts X's weight (1000) from
       children_weight of root. children_weight becomes -500.
       This triggers WARN_ON_ONCE().
    10. Set X's weight to 500.
    11. X starts I/O and cfq_group_service_tree_add() is called with X.
    12. cfq_group_service_tree_add() applies its new_weight (500) and adds it
        to children_weight of root. children_weight becomes 0. Calcularion of
        vfr triggers oops by divide error.
    
    weight should be updated right before adding it to children_weight.

    ALSA: hda - Fix invalid pin powermap without jack detection
    
    commit 7a9744cb455e6faa287e148394b4b422a6f3c5c4 upstream.
    
    When a driver is set up without the jack detection explicitly (either
    by passing a model option or via a specific fixup), the pin powermap
    of IDT/STAC codecs is set up wrongly, resulting in the silence
    output.  It's because of a logic failure in stac_init_power_map().
    It tries to avoid creating a callback for the pins that have other
    auto-hp and auto-mic callbacks, but the check is done in a wrong way
    at a wrong time.  The stac_init_power_map() should be called after
    creating other jack detection ctls, and the jack callback should be
    created only for jack-detectable widgets.
    
    This patch fixes the check in stac_init_power_map() and its callee
    at the right place, after snd_hda_gen_build_controls().

    ALSA: hda - Fix COEF setups for ALC1150 codec
    
    commit acf08081adb5e8fe0519eb97bb49797ef52614d6 upstream.
    
    ALC1150 codec seems to need the COEF- and PLL-setups just like its
    compatible ALC882 codec.  Some machines (e.g. SunMicro X10SAT) show
    the problem like too low output volumes unless the COEF setup is
    applied.

    arm64: ptrace: fix compat hardware watchpoint reporting
    
    commit 27d7ff273c2aad37b28f6ff0cab2cfa35b51e648 upstream.
    
    I'm not sure what I was on when I wrote this, but when iterating over
    the hardware watchpoint array (hbp_watch_array), our index is off by
    ARM_MAX_BRP, so we walk off the end of our thread_struct...
    
    ... except, a dodgy condition in the loop means that it never executes
    at all (bp cannot be NULL).
    
    This patch fixes the code so that we remove the bp check and use the
    correct index for accessing the watchpoint structures.

    trace: Fix epoll hang when we race with new entries
    
    commit 4ce97dbf50245227add17c83d87dc838e7ca79d0 upstream.
    
    Epoll on trace_pipe can sometimes hang in a weird case.  If the ring buffer is
    empty when we set waiters_pending but an event shows up exactly at that moment
    we can miss being woken up by the ring buffers irq work.  Since
    ring_buffer_empty() is inherently racey we will sometimes think that the buffer
    is not empty.  So we don't get woken up and we don't think there are any events
    even though there were some ready when we added the watch, which makes us hang.
    This patch fixes this by making sure that we are actually on the wait list
    before we set waiters_pending, and add a memory barrier to make sure
    ring_buffer_empty() is going to be correct.

    i2c: at91: Fix a race condition during signal handling in at91_do_twi_xfer.
    
    commit 6721f28a26efd6368497abbdef5dcfc59608d899 upstream.
    
    There is a race condition in at91_do_twi_xfer when signals arrive.
    If a signal is recieved while waiting for a transfer to complete
    wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout() will return -ERESTARTSYS.
    This is not handled correctly resulting in interrupts still being
    enabled and a transfer being in flight when we return.
    
    Symptoms include a range of oopses and bus lockups. Oopses can happen
    when the transfer completes because the interrupt handler will corrupt
    the stack. If a new transfer is started before the interrupt fires
    the controller will start a new transfer in the middle of the old one,
    resulting in confused slaves and a locked bus.
    
    To avoid this, use wait_for_completion_io_timeout instead so that we
    don't have to deal with gracefully shutting down the transfer and
    disabling the interrupts.

    commit 75b81f339c6af43f6f4a1b3eabe0603321dade65 upstream.
    
    The driver was not bound checking the received length byte to ensure it was within the
    the buffer size that is allocated for SMBus blocks. This resulted in buffer overflows
    whenever an invalid length byte was received.
    It also failed to ensure the length byte was not zero. If it received zero, it would end up
    in an infinite loop as the at91_twi_read_next_byte function returned immediately without
    allowing RHR to be read to clear the RXRDY interrupt.
    
    Tested agaisnt a SMBus compliant battery.

    i2c: mv64xxx: continue probe when clock-frequency is missing
    
    commit 0ce4bc1dbdd911ae1763e2d4ff36bd1b214a59f7 upstream.
    
    The "clock-frequency" DT property is listed as optional, However,
    the current code stores the return value of of_property_read_u32 in
    the return code of mv64xxx_of_config, but then forgets to clear it
    after setting the default value of "clock-frequency". It is then
    passed out to the main probe function, resulting in a probe failure
    when "clock-frequency" is missing.
    
    This patch checks and then throws away the return value of
    of_property_read_u32, instead of storing it and having to clear it
    afterwards.
    
    This issue was discovered after the property was removed from all
    sunxi DTs.

    commit 05e0127f9e362b36aa35f17b1a3d52bca9322a3a upstream.
    
    The architecture specifies that when the processor wakes up from a WFE
    or WFI instruction, the instruction is considered complete, however we
    currrently return to EL1 (or EL0) at the WFI/WFE instruction itself.
    
    While most guests may not be affected by this because their local
    exception handler performs an exception returning setting the event bit
    or with an interrupt pending, some guests like UEFI will get wedged due
    this little mishap.
    
    Simply skip the instruction when we have completed the emulation.

    arm64: use irq_set_affinity with force=false when migrating irqs
    
    commit 3d8afe3099ebc602848aa7f09235cce3a9a023ce upstream.
    
    The arm64 interrupt migration code on cpu offline calls
    irqchip.irq_set_affinity() with the argument force=true. Originally
    this argument had no effect because it was not used by any interrupt
    chip driver and there was no semantics defined.
    
    This changed with commit 01f8fa4f01d8 ("genirq: Allow forcing cpu
    affinity of interrupts") which made the force argument useful to route
    interrupts to not yet online cpus without checking the target cpu
    against the cpu online mask. The following commit ffde1de64012
    ("irqchip: gic: Support forced affinity setting") implemented this for
    the GIC interrupt controller.
    
    As a consequence the cpu offline irq migration fails if CPU0 is
    offlined, because CPU0 is still set in the affinity mask and the
    validation against cpu online mask is skipped to the force argument
    being true. The following first_cpu(mask) selection always selects
    CPU0 as the target.
    
    Commit 601c942176d8("arm64: use cpu_online_mask when using forced
    irq_set_affinity") intended to fix the above mentioned issue but
    introduced another issue where affinity can be migrated to a wrong
    CPU due to unconditional copy of cpu_online_mask.
    
    As with for arm, solve the issue by calling irq_set_affinity() with
    force=false from the CPU offline irq migration code so the GIC driver
    validates the affinity mask against CPU online mask and therefore
    removes CPU0 from the possible target candidates. Also revert the
    changes done in the commit 601c942176d8 as it's no longer needed.
    
    Tested on Juno platform.

    arm64: flush TLS registers during exec
    
    commit eb35bdd7bca29a13c8ecd44e6fd747a84ce675db upstream.
    
    Nathan reports that we leak TLS information from the parent context
    during an exec, as we don't clear the TLS registers when flushing the
    thread state.
    
    This patch updates the flushing code so that we:
    
      (1) Unconditionally zero the tpidr_el0 register (since this is fully
          context switched for native tasks and zeroed for compat tasks)
    
      (2) Zero the tp_value state in thread_info before clearing the
          tpidrr0_el0 register for compat tasks (since this is only writable
          by the set_tls compat syscall and therefore not fully switched).
    
    A missing compiler barrier is also added to the compat set_tls syscall.

    aio: fix reqs_available handling
    
    commit d856f32a86b2b015ab180ab7a55e455ed8d3ccc5 upstream.
    
    As reported by Dan Aloni, commit f8567a3845ac ("aio: fix aio request
    leak when events are reaped by userspace") introduces a regression when
    user code attempts to perform io_submit() with more events than are
    available in the ring buffer.  Reverting that commit would reintroduce a
    regression when user space event reaping is used.
    
    Fixing this bug is a bit more involved than the previous attempts to fix
    this regression.  Since we do not have a single point at which we can
    count events as being reaped by user space and io_getevents(), we have
    to track event completion by looking at the number of events left in the
    event ring.  So long as there are as many events in the ring buffer as
    there have been completion events generate, we cannot call
    put_reqs_available().  The code to check for this is now placed in
    refill_reqs_available().
    
    A test program from Dan and modified by me for verifying this bug is available
    at http://www.kvack.org/~bcrl/20140824-aio_bug.c .

    of/irq: Fix lookup to use 'interrupts-extended' property first
    
    commit a9ecdc0fdc54aa499604dbd43132988effcac9b4 upstream.
    
    In case the Device Tree blob passed by the boot agent supplies both an
    'interrupts-extended' and an 'interrupts' property in order to allow for
    older kernels to be usable, prefer the new-style 'interrupts-extended'
    property which conveys a lot more information.
    
    This allows us to have bootloaders willingly maintaining backwards
    compatibility with older kernels without entirely deprecating the
    'interrupts' property.
    
    Update the bindings documentation to describe a situation where both the
    'interrupts-extended' and the 'interrupts' property are present, and
    which one takes precedence over the other.

    drm/radeon: enable bapm by default on desktop TN/RL boards
    
    commit 0c78a44964db3d483b0c09a8236e0fe123aa9cfc upstream.
    
    bapm enabled the GPU and CPU to share TDP headroom.  It was
    disabled by default since some laptops hung when it was enabled
    in conjunction with dpm.  It seems to be stable on desktop
    boards and fixes hangs on boot with dpm enabled on certain
    boards, so enable it by default on desktop boards.

    drm/i915: read HEAD register back in init_ring_common() to enforce ordering
    
    commit ece4a17d237a79f63fbfaf3f724a12b6d500555c upstream.
    
    Withtout this, ring initialization fails reliabily during resume with
    
            [drm:init_ring_common] *ERROR* render ring initialization failed ctl 0001f001 head ffffff8804 tail 00000000 start 000e4000
    
    This is not a complete fix, but it is verified to make the ring
    initialization failures during resume much less likely.
    
    We were not able to root-cause this bug (likely HW-specific to Gen4 chips)
    yet. This is therefore used as a ducttape before problem is fully
    understood and proper fix created, so that people don't suffer from
    completely unusable systems in the meantime.

    drm/ttm: Pass GFP flags in order to avoid deadlock.

    Commit 7dc19d5a "drivers: convert shrinkers to new count/scan API" added
    deadlock warnings that ttm_page_pool_free() and ttm_dma_page_pool_free()
    are currently doing GFP_KERNEL allocation.
    
    But these functions did not get updated to receive gfp_t argument.
    This patch explicitly passes sc->gfp_mask or GFP_KERNEL to these functions,
    and removes the deadlock warning.

    drm/ttm: Fix possible stack overflow by recursive shrinker calls.
    
    commit 71336e011d1d2312bcbcaa8fcec7365024f3a95d upstream.
    
    While ttm_dma_pool_shrink_scan() tries to take mutex before doing GFP_KERNEL
    allocation, ttm_pool_shrink_scan() does not do it. This can result in stack
    overflow if kmalloc() in ttm_page_pool_free() triggered recursion due to
    memory pressure.
    
      shrink_slab()
      => ttm_pool_shrink_scan()
         => ttm_page_pool_free()
            => kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL)
               => shrink_slab()
                  => ttm_pool_shrink_scan()
                     => ttm_page_pool_free()
                        => kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL)
    
    Change ttm_pool_shrink_scan() to do like ttm_dma_pool_shrink_scan() does.

    drm/ttm: Use mutex_trylock() to avoid deadlock inside shrinker functions.
    
    commit 22e71691fd54c637800d10816bbeba9cf132d218 upstream.
    
    I can observe that RHEL7 environment stalls with 100% CPU usage when a
    certain type of memory pressure is given. While the shrinker functions
    are called by shrink_slab() before the OOM killer is triggered, the stall
    lasts for many minutes.
    
    One of reasons of this stall is that
    ttm_dma_pool_shrink_count()/ttm_dma_pool_shrink_scan() are called and
    are blocked at mutex_lock(&_manager->lock). GFP_KERNEL allocation with
    _manager->lock held causes someone (including kswapd) to deadlock when
    these functions are called due to memory pressure. This patch changes
    "mutex_lock();" to "if (!mutex_trylock()) return ...;" in order to
    avoid deadlock.

    commit 46c2df68f03a236b30808bba361f10900c88d95e upstream.
    
    We can use "unsigned int" instead of "atomic_t" by updating start_pool
    variable under _manager->lock. This patch will make it possible to avoid
    skipping when choosing a pool to shrink in round-robin style, after next
    patch changes mutex_lock(_manager->lock) to !mutex_trylock(_manager->lork).

    drm/tilcdc: panel: fix dangling sysfs connector node
    
    commit e396900e649b0af31161634d87fe37076f46c12b upstream.
    
    Add a drm_sysfs_connector_remove call when we destroy the panel to make
    sure the connector node in sysfs gets deleted.
    
    This is required for proper unload and re-load of this driver as a
    module. Without this, we would get a warning at re-load time like so:

    carl9170: fix sending URBs with wrong type when using full-speed
    
    commit 671796dd96b6cd85b75fba9d3007bcf7e5f7c309 upstream.
    
    The driver assumes that endpoint 4 is always an interrupt endpoint.
    Unfortunately the type differs between high-speed and full-speed
    configurations while in the former case it is indeed an interrupt
    endpoint this is not true for the latter case - here it is a bulk
    endpoint. When sending URBs with the wrong type the kernel will
    generate a warning message including backtrace. In this specific
    case there will be a huge amount of warnings which can bring the system
    to freeze.
    
    To fix this we are now sending URBs to endpoint 4 using the type
    found in the endpoint descriptor.
    
    A side note: The carl9170 firmware currently specifies endpoint 4 as
    interrupt endpoint even in the full-speed configuration but this has
    no relevance because before this firmware is loaded the endpoint type
    is as described above and after the firmware is running the stick is not
    reenumerated and so the old descriptor is used.
