    xhci: Fix use-after-free in xhci_free_virt_device
    
    commit 44a182b9d17765514fa2b1cc911e4e65134eef93 upstream.
    
    KASAN found a use-after-free in xhci_free_virt_device+0x33b/0x38e
    where xhci_free_virt_device() sets slot id to 0 if udev exists:
    if (dev->udev && dev->udev->slot_id)
            dev->udev->slot_id = 0;
    
    dev->udev will be true even if udev is freed because dev->udev is
    not set to NULL.
    
    set dev->udev pointer to NULL in xhci_free_dev()
    
    The original patch went to stable so this fix needs to be applied
    there as well.

    dm thin: handle running out of data space vs concurrent discard
    
    commit a685557fbbc3122ed11e8ad3fa63a11ebc5de8c3 upstream.
    
    Discards issued to a DM thin device can complete to userspace (via
    fstrim) _before_ the metadata changes associated with the discards is
    reflected in the thinp superblock (e.g. free blocks).  As such, if a
    user constructs a test that loops repeatedly over these steps, block
    allocation can fail due to discards not having completed yet:
    1) fill thin device via filesystem file
    2) remove file
    3) fstrim
    
    From initial report, here:
    https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2018-April/msg00022.html
    
    "The root cause of this issue is that dm-thin will first remove
    mapping and increase corresponding blocks' reference count to prevent
    them from being reused before DISCARD bios get processed by the
    underlying layers. However. increasing blocks' reference count could
    also increase the nr_allocated_this_transaction in struct sm_disk
    which makes smd->old_ll.nr_allocated +
    smd->nr_allocated_this_transaction bigger than smd->old_ll.nr_blocks.
    In this case, alloc_data_block() will never commit metadata to reset
    the begin pointer of struct sm_disk, because sm_disk_get_nr_free()
    always return an underflow value."
    
    While there is room for improvement to the space-map accounting that
    thinp is making use of: the reality is this test is inherently racey and
    will result in the previous iteration's fstrim's discard(s) completing
    vs concurrent block allocation, via dd, in the next iteration of the
    loop.
    
    No amount of space map accounting improvements will be able to allow
    user's to use a block before a discard of that block has completed.
    
    So the best we can really do is allow DM thinp to gracefully handle such
    aggressive use of all the pool's data by degrading the pool into
    out-of-data-space (OODS) mode.  We _should_ get that behaviour already
    (if space map accounting didn't falsely cause alloc_data_block() to
    believe free space was available).. but short of that we handle the
    current reality that dm_pool_alloc_data_block() can return -ENOSPC.

    x86/efi: Fix efi_call_phys_epilog() with CONFIG_X86_5LEVEL=y
    
    commit cfe19577047e74cdac5826adbdc2337d8437f8fb upstream.
    
    Open-coded page table entry checks don't work correctly when we fold the
    page table level at runtime.
    
    pgd_present() on 4-level paging machine always returns true, but
    open-coded version of the check may return false-negative result and
    we silently skip the rest of the loop body in efi_call_phys_epilog().
    
    Replace open-coded checks with proper helpers.

    A device may have boundary restrictions where the number of sectors

    to cap the max size to the smaller of the two limits.

    slub: fix failure when we delete and create a slab cache
    
    commit d50d82faa0c964e31f7a946ba8aba7c715ca7ab0 upstream.
    
    In kernel 4.17 I removed some code from dm-bufio that did slab cache
    merging (commit 21bb13276768: "dm bufio: remove code that merges slab
    caches") - both slab and slub support merging caches with identical
    attributes, so dm-bufio now just calls kmem_cache_create and relies on
    implicit merging.
    
    This uncovered a bug in the slub subsystem - if we delete a cache and
    immediatelly create another cache with the same attributes, it fails
    because of duplicate filename in /sys/kernel/slab/.  The slub subsystem
    offloads freeing the cache to a workqueue - and if we create the new
    cache before the workqueue runs, it complains because of duplicate
    filename in sysfs.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by moving the call of kobject_del from
    sysfs_slab_remove_workfn to shutdown_cache.  kobject_del must be called
    while we hold slab_mutex - so that the sysfs entry is deleted before a
    cache with the same attributes could be created.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix the problem of two front mics on more machines
    
    commit e41fc8c5bd41b96bfae5ce4c66bee6edabc932e8 upstream.
    
    We have 3 more Lenovo machines, they all have 2 front mics on them,
    so they need the fixup to change the location for one of two mics.
    
    Among these 3 Lenovo machines, one of them has the same pin cfg as the
    machine with subid 0x17aa3138, so use the pin cfg table to apply fixup
    for them. The rest machines don't share the same pin cfg, so far use
    the subid to apply fixup for them.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix pop noise on Lenovo P50 & co
    
    commit d5a6cabf02210b896a60eee7c04c670ee9ba6dca upstream.
    
    Some Lenovo laptops, e.g. Lenovo P50, showed the pop noise at resume
    or runtime resume.  It turned out to be reduced by applying
    alc_no_shutup() just like TPT440 quirk does.
    
    Since there are many Lenovo models showing the same behavior, put this
    workaround in ALC269_FIXUP_THINKPAD_ACPI entry so that it's applied
    commonly to all such Lenovo machines.

    ALSA: timer: Fix UBSAN warning at SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_NEXT_DEVICE ioctl
    
    commit b41f794f284966fd6ec634111e3b40d241389f96 upstream.
    
    The kernel may spew a WARNING about UBSAN undefined behavior at
    handling ALSA timer ioctl SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_NEXT_DEVICE:
    
    UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in sound/core/timer.c:1524:19
    signed integer overflow:
    2147483647 + 1 cannot be represented in type 'int'
    Call Trace:

    It happens only when a value with INT_MAX is passed, as we're
    incrementing it unconditionally.  So the fix is trivial, check the
    value with INT_MAX.  Although the bug itself is fairly harmless, it's
    better to fix it so that fuzzers won't hit this again later.

    Commit 40f7090bb1b4 ("Input: elan_i2c_smbus - fix corrupted stack")
    fixed most of the functions using i2c_smbus_read_block_data() to
    allocate a buffer with the maximum block size.  However three
    functions were left unchanged:
    
    * In elan_smbus_initialize(), increase the buffer size in the same
      way.
    * In elan_smbus_calibrate_result(), the buffer is provided by the
      caller (calibrate_store()), so introduce a bounce buffer.  Also
      name the result buffer size.
    * In elan_smbus_get_report(), the buffer is provided by the caller
      but happens to be the right length.  Add a compile-time assertion
      to ensure this remains the case.

    Input: xpad - fix GPD Win 2 controller name
    
    commit dd6bee81c942c0ea01030da9356026afb88f9d18 upstream.
    
    This fixes using the controller with SDL2.
    
    SDL2 has a naive algorithm to apply the correct settings to a controller.
    For X-Box compatible controllers it expects that the controller name
    contains a variation of a 'XBOX'-string.
    
    This patch changes the identifier to contain "X-Box" as substring.  Tested
    with Steam and C-Dogs-SDL which both detect the controller properly after
    adding this patch.

    xen: Remove unnecessary BUG_ON from __unbind_from_irq()
    
    commit eef04c7b3786ff0c9cb1019278b6c6c2ea0ad4ff upstream.
    
    Commit 910f8befdf5b ("xen/pirq: fix error path cleanup when binding
    MSIs") fixed a couple of errors in error cleanup path of
    xen_bind_pirq_msi_to_irq(). This cleanup allowed a call to
    __unbind_from_irq() with an unbound irq, which would result in
    triggering the BUG_ON there.
    
    Since there is really no reason for the BUG_ON (xen_free_irq() can
    operate on unbound irqs) we can remove it.

    mm: fix devmem_is_allowed() for sub-page System RAM intersections
    
    commit 2bdce74412c249ac01dfe36b6b0043ffd7a5361e upstream.
    
    Hussam reports:
    
        I was poking around and for no real reason, I did cat /dev/mem and
        strings /dev/mem.  Then I saw the following warning in dmesg. I saved it
        and rebooted immediately.
    
         memremap attempted on mixed range 0x000000000009c000 size: 0x1000
         ------------[ cut here ]------------
         WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 11810 at kernel/memremap.c:98 memremap+0x104/0x170

          read_mem+0x89/0x1a0
          __vfs_read+0x36/0x170
    
    The memremap() implementation checks for attempts to remap System RAM
    with MEMREMAP_WB and instead redirects those mapping attempts to the
    linear map.  However, that only works if the physical address range
    being remapped is page aligned.  In low memory we have situations like
    the following:
    
        00000000-00000fff : Reserved
        00001000-0009fbff : System RAM
        0009fc00-0009ffff : Reserved
    
    ...where System RAM intersects Reserved ranges on a sub-page page
    granularity.
    
    Given that devmem_is_allowed() special cases any attempt to map System
    RAM in the first 1MB of memory, replace page_is_ram() with the more
    precise region_intersects() to trap attempts to map disallowed ranges.

    mm/ksm.c: ignore STABLE_FLAG of rmap_item->address in rmap_walk_ksm()
    
    commit 1105a2fc022f3c7482e32faf516e8bc44095f778 upstream.
    
    In our armv8a server(QDF2400), I noticed lots of WARN_ON caused by
    PAGE_SIZE unaligned for rmap_item->address under memory pressure
    tests(start 20 guests and run memhog in the host).
    
      WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 4641 at virt/kvm/arm/mmu.c:1826 kvm_age_hva_handler+0xc0/0xc8

       do_mem_abort+0x68/0xf0
       el0_da+0x24/0x28
    
    In rmap_walk_ksm, the rmap_item->address might still have the
    STABLE_FLAG, then the start and end in handle_hva_to_gpa might not be
    PAGE_SIZE aligned.  Thus it will cause exceptions in handle_hva_to_gpa
    on arm64.
    
    This patch fixes it by ignoring (not removing) the low bits of address
    when doing rmap_walk_ksm.
    
    IMO, it should be backported to stable tree.  the storm of WARN_ONs is
    very easy for me to reproduce.  More than that, I watched a panic (not
    reproducible) as follows:
    
      page:ffff7fe003742d80 count:-4871 mapcount:-2126053375 mapping: (null) index:0x0

    I even injected a fault on purpose in kvm_unmap_hva_range by seting
    size=size-0x200, the call trace is similar as above.  So I thought the
    panic is similarly caused by the root cause of WARN_ON.

    rbd: flush rbd_dev->watch_dwork after watch is unregistered
    
    commit 23edca864951250af845a11da86bb3ea63522ed2 upstream.
    
    There is a problem if we are going to unmap a rbd device and the
    watch_dwork is going to queue delayed work for watch:
    
    unmap Thread                    watch Thread                  timer
    do_rbd_remove
      cancel_tasks_sync(rbd_dev)
                                    queue_delayed_work for watch
      destroy_workqueue(rbd_dev->task_wq)
        drain_workqueue(wq)
        destroy other resources in wq
                                                                  call_timer_fn
                                                                    __queue_work()
    
    Then the delayed work escape the cancel_tasks_sync() and
    destroy_workqueue() and we will get an user-after-free call trace:

    pwm: lpss: platform: Save/restore the ctrl register over a suspend/resume
    
    commit 1d375b58c12f08d8570b30b865def4734517f04f upstream.
    
    On some devices the contents of the ctrl register get lost over a
    suspend/resume and the PWM comes back up disabled after the resume.
    
    This is seen on some Bay Trail devices with the PWM in ACPI enumerated
    mode, so it shows up as a platform device instead of a PCI device.
    
    If we still think it is enabled and then try to change the duty-cycle
    after this, we end up with a "PWM_SW_UPDATE was not cleared" error and
    the PWM is stuck in that state from then on.
    
    This commit adds suspend and resume pm callbacks to the pwm-lpss-platform
    code, which save/restore the ctrl register over a suspend/resume, fixing
    this.
    
    Note that:
    
    1) There is no need to do this over a runtime suspend, since we
    only runtime suspend when disabled and then we properly set the enable
    bit and reprogram the timings when we re-enable the PWM.
    
    2) This may be happening on more systems then we realize, but has been
    covered up sofar by a bug in the acpi-lpss.c code which was save/restoring
    the regular device registers instead of the lpss private registers due to
    lpss_device_desc.prv_offset not being set. This is fixed by a later patch
    in this series.

    ACPI / LPSS: Add missing prv_offset setting for byt/cht PWM devices
    
    commit fdcb613d49321b5bf5d5a1bd0fba8e7c241dcc70 upstream.
    
    The LPSS PWM device on on Bay Trail and Cherry Trail devices has a set
    of private registers at offset 0x800, the current lpss_device_desc for
    them already sets the LPSS_SAVE_CTX flag to have these saved/restored
    over device-suspend, but the current lpss_device_desc was not setting
    the prv_offset field, leading to the regular device registers getting
    saved/restored instead.
    
    This is causing the PWM controller to no longer work, resulting in a black
    screen,  after a suspend/resume on systems where the firmware clears the
    APB clock and reset bits at offset 0x804.
    
    This commit fixes this by properly setting prv_offset to 0x800 for
    the PWM devices.

    NFSv4: Fix possible 1-byte stack overflow in nfs_idmap_read_and_verify_message
    
    commit d68894800ec5712d7ddf042356f11e36f87d7f78 upstream.
    
    In nfs_idmap_read_and_verify_message there is an incorrect sprintf '%d'
    that converts the __u32 'im_id' from struct idmap_msg to 'id_str', which
    is a stack char array variable of length NFS_UINT_MAXLEN == 11.
    If a uid or gid value is > 2147483647 = 0x7fffffff, the conversion
    overflows into a negative value, for example:
    crash> p (unsigned) (0x80000000)
    $1 = 2147483648
    crash> p (signed) (0x80000000)
    $2 = -2147483648
    The '-' sign is written to the buffer and this causes a 1 byte overflow
    when the NULL byte is written, which corrupts kernel stack memory.  If
    CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG is set we see a stack-protector panic:

    nfsd: restrict rd_maxcount to svc_max_payload in nfsd_encode_readdir
    
    commit 9c2ece6ef67e9d376f32823086169b489c422ed0 upstream.
    
    nfsd4_readdir_rsize restricts rd_maxcount to svc_max_payload when
    estimating the size of the readdir reply, but nfsd_encode_readdir
    restricts it to INT_MAX when encoding the reply.  This can result in log
    messages like "kernel: RPC request reserved 32896 but used 1049444".
    
    Restrict rd_dircount similarly (no reason it should be larger than
    svc_max_payload).

            drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c:314 dvb_frontend_get_event() warn: inconsistent returns 'sem:&fepriv->sem'.

    The lock implementation for get event is wrong, as, if an
    interrupt occurs, down_interruptible() will fail, and the
    routine will call up() twice when userspace calls the ioctl
    again.
    
    The bad code is there since when Linux migrated to git, in
    2005.

    media: vsp1: Release buffers for each video node
    
    commit 83967993f2320575c0ab27a80bf1d7535909c2f4 upstream.
    
    Commit 372b2b0399fc ("media: v4l: vsp1: Release buffers in
    start_streaming error path") introduced a helper to clean up buffers on
    error paths, but inadvertently changed the code such that only the
    output WPF buffers were cleaned, rather than the video node being
    operated on.
    
    Since then vsp1_video_cleanup_pipeline() has grown to perform both video
    node cleanup, as well as pipeline cleanup. Split the implementation into
    two distinct functions that perform the required work, so that each
    video node can release its buffers correctly on streamoff. The pipe
    cleanup that was performed in the vsp1_video_stop_streaming() (releasing
    the pipe->dl) is moved to the function for clarity.

    perf intel-pt: Fix "Unexpected indirect branch" error
    
    commit 9fb523363f6e3984457fee95bb7019395384ffa7 upstream.
    
    Some Atom CPUs can produce FUP packets that contain NLIP (next linear
    instruction pointer) instead of CLIP (current linear instruction
    pointer).  That will result in "Unexpected indirect branch" errors. Fix
    by comparing IP to NLIP in that case.

    perf intel-pt: Fix MTC timing after overflow
    
    commit dd27b87ab5fcf3ea1c060b5e3ab5d31cc78e9f4c upstream.
    
    On some platforms, overflows will clear before MTC wraparound, and there
    is no following TSC/TMA packet. In that case the previous TMA is valid.
    Since there will be a valid TMA either way, stop setting 'have_tma' to
    false upon overflow.

    arm: dts: mt7623: fix invalid memory node being generated
    
    commit c0b0d540db1a8bfb041166c4991dd6f624e8de45 upstream.
    
    Below two wrong nodes in existing DTS files would cause a fail boot since
    in fact the address 0 is not the correct place the memory device locates
    at.
    
    memory {
            device_type = "memory";
            reg = <0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0>;
    };
    
    memory@80000000 {
            reg = <0x0 0x80000000 0x0 0x40000000>;
    };
    
    In order to avoid having a memory node starting at address 0, we can't
    include file skeleton64.dtsi and instead need to explicitly manually
    define a few of properties the DTS relies on such as #address-cells
    and #size-cells in root node and device_type in the node memory@80000000.

    mfd: intel-lpss: Fix Intel Cannon Lake LPSS I2C input clock
    
    commit 4e93a658576ab115977225c9d0992b97ff19ba8c upstream.
    
    Intel Cannon Lake PCH has much higher 216 MHz input clock to LPSS I2C
    than Sunrisepoint which uses 120 MHz. Preliminary information was that
    both share the same clock rate but actual silicon implements elevated
    rate for better support for 3.4 MHz high-speed I2C.
    
    This incorrect input clock rate results too high I2C bus clock in case
    ACPI doesn't provide tuned I2C timing parameters since I2C host
    controller driver calculates them from input clock rate.
    
    Fix this by using the correct rate. We still share the same 230 ns SDA
    hold time value than Sunrisepoint.

    ubi: fastmap: Correctly handle interrupted erasures in EBA
    
    commit 781932375ffc6411713ee0926ccae8596ed0261c upstream.
    
    Fastmap cannot track the LEB unmap operation, therefore it can
    happen that after an interrupted erasure the mapping still looks
    good from Fastmap's point of view, while reading from the PEB will
    cause an ECC error and confuses the upper layer.
    
    Instead of teaching users of UBI how to deal with that, we read back
    the VID header and check for errors. If the PEB is empty or shows ECC
    errors we fixup the mapping and schedule the PEB for erasure.

    ubi: fastmap: Cancel work upon detach
    
    commit 6e7d80161066c99d12580d1b985cb1408bb58cf1 upstream.
    
    Ben Hutchings pointed out that 29b7a6fa1ec0 ("ubi: fastmap: Don't flush
    fastmap work on detach") does not really fix the problem, it just
    reduces the risk to hit the race window where fastmap work races against
    free()'ing ubi->volumes[].
    
    The correct approach is making sure that no more fastmap work is in
    progress before we free ubi data structures.
    So we cancel fastmap work right after the ubi background thread is
    stopped.
    By setting ubi->thread_enabled to zero we make sure that no further work
    tries to wake the thread.

    commit 4a2e84c6ed85434ce7843e4844b4d3263f7e233b upstream.
    
    All the managed resources would be freed by the time release function

    bad things.
    
    Found this issue while testing Audio usecase where the dsp is started up
    and shutdown in a loop.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by using simple kzalloc for allocating
    channel->name and channel which is then freed in qcom_smd_edge_release().
    
    Without this patch restarting a remoteproc would crash the system.

    md: fix two problems with setting the "re-add" device state.
    
    commit 011abdc9df559ec75779bb7c53a744c69b2a94c6 upstream.
    
    If "re-add" is written to the "state" file for a device
    which is faulty, this has an effect similar to removing
    and re-adding the device.  It should take up the
    same slot in the array that it previously had, and
    an accelerated (e.g. bitmap-based) rebuild should happen.
    
    The slot that "it previously had" is determined by
    rdev->saved_raid_disk.
    However this is not set when a device fails (only when a device
    is added), and it is cleared when resync completes.
    This means that "re-add" will normally work once, but may not work a
    second time.
    
    This patch includes two fixes.
    1/ when a device fails, record the ->raid_disk value in
        ->saved_raid_disk before clearing ->raid_disk
    2/ when "re-add" is written to a device for which
        ->saved_raid_disk is not set, fail.
    
    I think this is suitable for stable as it can
    cause re-adding a device to be forced to do a full
    resync which takes a lot longer and so puts data at
    more risk.

    clk-gate core will take bit_idx through clk_register_gate
    and then do clk_gate_ops by using BIT(bit_idx), but rtc-sun6i
    is passing bit_idx as BIT(bit_idx) it becomes BIT(BIT(bit_idx)

    at half speed.
    
    The PLL code uses cached MUL and DIV values which get set in set_rate()
    and applied in prepare(), but the recalc_rate() function instead
    queries the hardware instead of using these cached values. Therefore,
    if recalc_rate() is called between a set_rate() and prepare(), the
    wrong frequency is calculated and later the USB clock divider for the
    SAM9N12 SOC will be configured for an incorrect clock.
    
    In my case, the PLL hardware was set to 96 Mhz before the OHCI
    driver loads, and therefore the usb clock divider was being set
    to /2 even though the OHCI driver set the PLL to 48 Mhz.
    
    As an alternative explanation, I noticed this was fixed in the past by
    87e2ed338f1b ("clk: at91: fix recalc_rate implementation of PLL
    driver") but the bug was later re-introduced by 1bdf02326b71 ("clk:
    at91: make use of syscon/regmap internally").

    linvdimm, pmem: Preserve read-only setting for pmem devices
    
    commit 254a4cd50b9fe2291a12b8902e08e56dcc4e9b10 upstream.
    
    The pmem driver does not honor a forced read-only setting for very long:
            $ blockdev --setro /dev/pmem0
            $ blockdev --getro /dev/pmem0
            1
    
    followed by various commands like these:
            $ blockdev --rereadpt /dev/pmem0
            or
            $ mkfs.ext4 /dev/pmem0
    
    results in this in the kernel serial log:
             nd_pmem namespace0.0: region0 read-write, marking pmem0 read-write
    
    with the read-only setting lost:
            $ blockdev --getro /dev/pmem0
            0
    
    That's from bus.c nvdimm_revalidate_disk(), which always applies the
    setting from nd_region (which is initially based on the ACPI NFIT
    NVDIMM state flags not_armed bit).
    
    In contrast, commit 20bd1d026aac ("scsi: sd: Keep disk read-only when
    re-reading partition") fixed this issue for SCSI devices to preserve
    the previous setting if it was set to read-only.
    
    This patch modifies bus.c to preserve any previous read-only setting.
    It also eliminates the kernel serial log print except for cases where
    read-write is changed to read-only, so it doesn't print read-only to
    read-only non-changes.

    scsi: zfcp: fix missing REC trigger trace for all objects in ERP_FAILED
    
    commit 8c3d20aada70042a39c6a6625be037c1472ca610 upstream.
    
    That other commit introduced an inconsistency because it would trace on
    ERP_FAILED for all callers of port forced reopen triggers (not just
    terminate_rport_io), but it would not trace on ERP_FAILED for all callers of
    other ERP triggers such as adapter, port regular, LUN.
    
    Therefore, generalize that other commit. zfcp_erp_action_enqueue() already
    had two early outs which re-used the one zfcp_dbf_rec_trig() call.  All ERP
    trigger functions finally run through zfcp_erp_action_enqueue().  So move
    the special handling for ZFCP_STATUS_COMMON_ERP_FAILED into
    zfcp_erp_action_enqueue() and add another early out with new trace marker
    for pseudo ERP need in this case. This removes all early returns from all
    ERP trigger functions so we always end up at zfcp_dbf_rec_trig().

    commit d70aab55924b44f213fec2b900b095430b33eec6 upstream.
    
    For problem determination we always want to see when we were invoked on the
    terminate_rport_io callback whether we perform something or not.
    
    Temporal event sequence of interest with a long fast_io_fail_tmo of 27 sec:
    
    loose remote port

        block rport
         start fast_io_fail_tmo
        send ADISC ELS
      4                    recv ADISC fail
                           block zfcp_port
                                               port forced reopen
                                               send open port
     12                    recv open port fail
                                               q p.gid_pn_work

                                               (zfcp_erp_wait would return)
        GID_PN fail
    
    Before this point, we got a SCSI trace with tag "sctrpi1" on fast_io_fail,
    e.g. with the typical 5 sec setting.
    
        port.status |= ERP_FAILED
    
    If fast_io_fail_tmo triggers after this point, we missed a SCSI trace.

        _zfcp_erp_port_forced_reopen
         if (port.status & ERP_FAILED)
          return;
    
    Therefore, write a trace before above early return.

    scsi: zfcp: fix missing REC trigger trace on terminate_rport_io early return
    
    commit 96d9270499471545048ed8a6d7f425a49762283d upstream.
    
    get_device() and its internally used kobject_get() only return NULL if they
    get passed NULL as argument. zfcp_get_port_by_wwpn() loops over
    adapter->port_list so the iteration variable port is always non-NULL.
    Struct device is embedded in struct zfcp_port so &port->dev is always
    non-NULL. This is the argument to get_device().  However, if we get an
    fc_rport in terminate_rport_io() for which we cannot find a match within
    zfcp_get_port_by_wwpn(), the latter can return NULL.  v2.6.30 commit
    70932935b61e ("[SCSI] zfcp: Fix oops when port disappears") introduced an
    early return without adding a trace record for this case.  Even if we don't
    need recovery in this case, for debugging we should still see that our
    callback was invoked originally by scsi_transport_fc.

    scsi: zfcp: fix misleading REC trigger trace where erp_action setup failed
    
    commit 512857a795cbbda5980efa4cdb3c0b6602330408 upstream.
    
    If a SCSI device is deleted during scsi_eh host reset, we cannot get a
    reference to the SCSI device anymore since scsi_device_get returns !=0 by
    design. Assuming the recovery of adapter and port(s) was successful,
    zfcp_erp_strategy_followup_success() attempts to trigger a LUN reset for the
    half-gone SCSI device. Unfortunately, it causes the following confusing
    trace record which states that zfcp will do a LUN recovery as "ERP need" is
    ZFCP_ERP_ACTION_REOPEN_LUN == 1 and equals "ERP want".
    
    Old example trace record formatted with zfcpdbf from s390-tools:
    
    Tag:           : ersfs_3 ERP, trigger, unit reopen, port reopen succeeded
    LUN            : 0x<FCP_LUN>
    WWPN           : 0x<WWPN>
    D_ID           : 0x<N_Port-ID>
    Adapter status : 0x5400050b
    Port status    : 0x54000001
    LUN status     : 0x40000000     ZFCP_STATUS_COMMON_RUNNING
                                    but not ZFCP_STATUS_COMMON_UNBLOCKED as it
                                    was closed on close part of adapter reopen
    ERP want       : 0x01
    ERP need       : 0x01           misleading
    
    However, zfcp_erp_setup_act() returns NULL as it cannot get the reference.
    Hence, zfcp_erp_action_enqueue() takes an early goto out and _NO_ recovery
    actually happens.
    
    We always do want the recovery trigger trace record even if no erp_action
    could be enqueued as in this case. For other cases where we did not enqueue
    an erp_action, 'need' has always been zero to indicate this. In order to
    indicate above goto out, introduce an eyecatcher "flag" to mark the "ERP
    need" as 'not needed' but still keep the information which erp_action type,
    that zfcp_erp_required_act() had decided upon, is needed.  0xc_ is chosen to
    be visibly different from 0x0_ in "ERP want".
    
    New example trace record formatted with zfcpdbf from s390-tools:
    
    Tag:           : ersfs_3 ERP, trigger, unit reopen, port reopen succeeded
    LUN            : 0x<FCP_LUN>
    WWPN           : 0x<WWPN>
    D_ID           : 0x<N_Port-ID>
    Adapter status : 0x5400050b
    Port status    : 0x54000001
    LUN status     : 0x40000000
    ERP want       : 0x01
    ERP need       : 0xc1           would need LUN ERP, but no action set up
                       ^
    
    Before v2.6.38 commit ae0904f60fab ("[SCSI] zfcp: Redesign of the debug
    tracing for recovery actions.") we could detect this case because the
    "erp_action" field in the trace was NULL. The rework removed erp_action as
    argument and field from the trace.
    
    This patch here is for tracing. A fix to allow LUN recovery in the case at
    hand is a topic for a separate patch.
    
    See also commit fdbd1c5e27da ("[SCSI] zfcp: Allow running unit/LUN shutdown
    without acquiring reference") for a similar case and background info.

    scsi: zfcp: fix missing SCSI trace for retry of abort / scsi_eh TMF
    
    commit 81979ae63e872ef650a7197f6ce6590059d37172 upstream.
    
    We already have a SCSI trace for the end of abort and scsi_eh TMF. Due to
    zfcp_erp_wait() and fc_block_scsi_eh() time can pass between the start of
    our eh callback and an actual send/recv of an abort / TMF request.  In order
    to see the temporal sequence including any abort / TMF send retries, add a
    trace before the above two blocking functions.  This supports problem
    determination with scsi_eh and parallel zfcp ERP.
    
    No need to explicitly trace the beginning of our eh callback, since we
    typically can send an abort / TMF and see its HBA response (in the worst
    case, it's a pseudo response on dismiss all of adapter recovery, e.g. due to
    an FSF request timeout [fsrth_1] of the abort / TMF). If we cannot send, we
    now get a trace record for the first "abrt_wt" or "[lt]r_wait" which denotes
    almost the beginning of the callback.
    
    No need to explicitly trace the wakeup after the above two blocking
    functions because the next retry loop causes another trace in any case and
    that is sufficient.

    commit df30781699f53e4fd4c494c6f7dd16e3d5c21d30 upstream.

    scsi: qla2xxx: Mask off Scope bits in retry delay
    
    commit 3cedc8797b9c0f2222fd45a01f849c57c088828b upstream.
    
    Some newer target uses "Status Qualifier" response in a returned "Busy
    Status". This new response code of 0x4001, which is "Scope" bits,
    translates to "Affects all units accessible by target".  Due to this new
    value returned in the Scope bits, driver was using that value as timeout
    value which resulted into driver waiting for 27min timeout.
    
    This patch masks off this Scope bits so that driver does not use this
    value as retry delay time.

    scsi: qla2xxx: Fix setting lower transfer speed if GPSC fails
    
    commit 413c2f33489b134e3cc65d9c3ff7861e8fdfe899 upstream.
    
    This patch prevents driver from setting lower default speed of 1 GB/sec,
    if the switch does not support Get Port Speed Capabilities (GPSC)
    command. Setting this default speed results into much lower write
    performance for large sequential WRITE.  This patch modifies driver to
    check for gpsc_supported flags and prevents driver from issuing
    MBC_SET_PORT_PARAM (001Ah) to set default speed of 1 GB/sec. If driver
    does not send this mailbox command, firmware assumes maximum supported
    link speed and will operate at the max speed.

    scsi: hpsa: disable device during shutdown
    
    commit 0d98ba8d70b0070ac117452ea0b663e26bbf46bf upstream.
    
    'Commit cc27b735ad3a ("PCI/portdrv: Turn off PCIe services during
    shutdown")' has been added to kernel to shutdown pending PCIe port service
    interrupts during reboot so that a newly started kexec kernel wouldn't
    observe pending interrupts.
    
    pcie_port_device_remove() is disabling the root port and switches by
    calling pci_disable_device() after all PCIe service drivers are shutdown.
    
    This has been found to cause crashes on HP DL360 Gen9 machines during
    reboot due to hpsa driver not clearing the bus master bit during the
    shutdown procedure by calling pci_disable_device().
    
    Disable device as part of the shutdown sequence.

    iio: adc: ad7791: remove sample freq sysfs attributes
    
    commit 7eb6b35d93c356f1afebbfb808bc296d6351e708 upstream.
    
    In the current state, these attributes are broken, because they are
    registered already, and the kernel throws a warning.
    The first registration happens via the `IIO_CHAN_INFO_SAMP_FREQ` flag from
    the `ad_sigma_delta` driver.
    
    In this commit these attrs are removed, and in the following the
    IIO_CHAN_INFO_SAMP_FREQ behavior will be implemented, which replaces these
    hooks.
    
    This is done to make things a bit easier to review as there is a bit of
    overlap in the patch if it's done all at once.

    Btrfs: fix return value on rename exchange failure
    
    commit c5b4a50b74018b3677098151ec5f4fce07d5e6a0 upstream.
    
    If we failed during a rename exchange operation after starting/joining a
    transaction, we would end up replacing the return value, stored in the
    local 'ret' variable, with the return value from btrfs_end_transaction().
    So this could end up returning 0 (success) to user space despite the
    operation having failed and aborted the transaction, because if there are
    multiple tasks having a reference on the transaction at the time
    btrfs_end_transaction() is called by the rename exchange, that function
    returns 0 (otherwise it returns -EIO and not the original error value).
    So fix this by not overwriting the return value on error after getting
    a transaction handle.

    X.509: unpack RSA signatureValue field from BIT STRING
    
    commit b65c32ec5a942ab3ada93a048089a938918aba7f upstream.
    
    The signatureValue field of a X.509 certificate is encoded as a BIT STRING.
    For RSA signatures this BIT STRING is of so-called primitive subtype, which
    contains a u8 prefix indicating a count of unused bits in the encoding.
    
    We have to strip this prefix from signature data, just as we already do for
    key data in x509_extract_key_data() function.
    
    This wasn't noticed earlier because this prefix byte is zero for RSA key
    sizes divisible by 8. Since BIT STRING is a big-endian encoding adding zero
    prefixes has no bearing on its value.
    
    The signature length, however was incorrect, which is a problem for RSA
    implementations that need it to be exactly correct (like AMD CCP).

    commit c1797b11a09c8323c92b074fd48b89a936c991d0 upstream.
    
    On a NUMA system, if an ITS is local to an offline node, the ITS driver may
    pick an offline CPU to bind the LPI.  In this case, pick an online CPU (and
    the first one will do).
    
    But on some systems, binding an LPI to non-local node CPU may cause
    deadlock (see Cavium erratum 23144).  In this case, just fail the activate
    and return an error code.

    time: Make sure jiffies_to_msecs() preserves non-zero time periods
    
    commit abcbcb80cd09cd40f2089d912764e315459b71f7 upstream.
    
    For the common cases where 1000 is a multiple of HZ, or HZ is a multiple of
    1000, jiffies_to_msecs() never returns zero when passed a non-zero time
    period.
    
    However, if HZ > 1000 and not an integer multiple of 1000 (e.g. 1024 or
    1200, as used on alpha and DECstation), jiffies_to_msecs() may return zero
    for small non-zero time periods.  This may break code that relies on
    receiving back a non-zero value.
    
    jiffies_to_usecs() does not need such a fix: one jiffy can only be less
    than one µs if HZ > 1000000, and such large values of HZ are already
    rejected at build time, twice:
    
      - include/linux/jiffies.h does #error if HZ >= 12288,
      - kernel/time/time.c has BUILD_BUG_ON(HZ > USEC_PER_SEC).
    
    Broken since forever.

    MIPS: io: Add barrier after register read in inX()
    
    commit 18f3e95b90b28318ef35910d21c39908de672331 upstream.
    
    While a barrier is present in the outX() functions before the register
    write, a similar barrier is missing in the inX() functions after the
    register read. This could allow memory accesses following inX() to
    observe stale data.
    
    This patch is very similar to commit a1cc7034e33d12dc1 ("MIPS: io: Add
    barrier after register read in readX()"). Because war_io_reorder_wmb()
    is both used by writeX() and outX(), if readX() need a barrier then so
    does inX().

    cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix scaling max/min limits with Turbo 3.0
    
    commit ff7c9917143b3a6cf2fa61212a32d67cf259bf9c upstream.
    
    When scaling max/min settings are changed, internally they are converted
    to a ratio using the max turbo 1 core turbo frequency. This works fine
    when 1 core max is same irrespective of the core. But under Turbo 3.0,
    this will not be the case. For example:
    Core 0: max turbo pstate: 43 (4.3GHz)
    Core 1: max turbo pstate: 45 (4.5GHz)
    In this case 1 core turbo ratio will be maximum of all, so it will be
    45 (4.5GHz). Suppose scaling max is set to 4GHz (ratio 40) for all cores
    ,then on core one it will be
     = max_state * policy->max / max_freq;
     = 43 * (4000000/4500000) = 38 (3.8GHz)
     = 38
    which is 200MHz less than the desired.
    On core2, it will be correctly set to ratio 40 (4GHz). Same holds true
    for scaling min frequency limit. So this requires usage of correct turbo
    max frequency for core one, which in this case is 4.3GHz. So we need to
    adjust per CPU cpu->pstate.turbo_freq using the maximum HWP ratio of that
    core.
    
    This change uses the HWP capability of a core to adjust max turbo
    frequency. But since Broadwell HWP doesn't use ratios in the HWP
    capabilities, we have to use legacy max 1 core turbo ratio. This is not
    a problem as the HWP capabilities don't differ among cores in Broadwell.
    We need to check for non Broadwell CPU model for applying this change,
    though.

    pinctrl: devicetree: Fix pctldev pointer overwrite
    
    commit bc3322bc166a2905bc91f774d7b22773dc7c063a upstream.
    
    Commit b89405b6102f ("pinctrl: devicetree: Fix dt_to_map_one_config
    handling of hogs") causes the pinctrl hog pins to not get initialized
    on i.MX platforms leaving them with the IOMUX settings untouched.
    
    This causes several regressions on i.MX such as:
    
    - OV5640 camera driver can not be probed anymore on imx6qdl-sabresd
    because the camera clock pin is in a pinctrl_hog group and since
    its pinctrl initialization is skipped, the camera clock is kept
    in GPIO functionality instead of CLK_CKO function.
    
    - Audio stopped working on imx6qdl-wandboard and imx53-qsb for
    the same reason.
    
    Richard Fitzgerald explains the problem:
    
    "I see the bug. If the hog node isn't a 1st level child of the pinctrl
    parent node it will go around the for(;;) loop again but on the first
    pass I overwrite pctldev with the result of
    get_pinctrl_dev_from_of_node() so it doesn't point to the pinctrl driver
    any more."
    
    Fix the issue by stashing the original pctldev so it doesn't
    get overwritten.

    pinctrl: samsung: Correct EINTG banks order
    
    commit 5cf9a338db94cfd570aa2607bef1b30996f188e3 upstream.
    
    All banks with GPIO interrupts should be at beginning of bank array and
    without any other types of banks between them.  This order is expected
    by exynos_eint_gpio_irq, when doing interrupt group to bank translation.
    Otherwise, kernel NULL pointer dereference would happen when trying to
    handle interrupt, due to wrong bank being looked up.  Observed on
    s5pv210, when trying to handle gpj0 interrupt, where kernel was mapping
    it to gpi bank.

    PCI: pciehp: Clear Presence Detect and Data Link Layer Status Changed on resume
    
    commit 13c65840feab8109194f9490c9870587173cb29d upstream.
    
    After a suspend/resume cycle the Presence Detect or Data Link Layer Status
    Changed bits might be set.  If we don't clear them those events will not
    fire anymore and nothing happens for instance when a device is now
    hot-unplugged.
    
    Fix this by clearing those bits in a newly introduced function
    pcie_reenable_notification().  This should be fine because immediately
    after, we check if the adapter is still present by reading directly from
    the status register.

    PCI: hv: Make sure the bus domain is really unique
    
    commit 29927dfb7f69bcf2ae7fd1cda10997e646a5189c upstream.
    
    When Linux runs as a guest VM in Hyper-V and Hyper-V adds the virtual PCI
    bus to the guest, Hyper-V always provides unique PCI domain.
    
    commit 4a9b0933bdfc ("PCI: hv: Use device serial number as PCI domain")
    overrode unique domain with the serial number of the first device added to
    the virtual PCI bus.
    
    The reason for that patch was to have a consistent and short name for the
    device, but Hyper-V doesn't provide unique serial numbers. Using non-unique
    serial numbers as domain IDs leads to duplicate device addresses, which
    causes PCI bus registration to fail.
    
    commit 0c195567a8f6 ("netvsc: transparent VF management") avoids the need
    for commit 4a9b0933bdfc ("PCI: hv: Use device serial number as PCI
    domain").  When scripts were used to configure VF devices, the name of
    the VF needed to be consistent and short, but with commit 0c195567a8f6
    ("netvsc: transparent VF management") all the setup is done in the kernel,
    and we do not need to maintain consistent name.
    
    Revert commit 4a9b0933bdfc ("PCI: hv: Use device serial number as PCI
    domain") so we can reliably support multiple devices being assigned to
    a guest.
    
    Tag the patch for stable kernels containing commit 0c195567a8f6
    ("netvsc: transparent VF management").

    MIPS: BCM47XX: Enable 74K Core ExternalSync for PCIe erratum
    
    commit 2a027b47dba6b77ab8c8e47b589ae9bbc5ac6175 upstream.
    
    The erratum and workaround are described by BCM5300X-ES300-RDS.pdf as
    below.
    
      R10: PCIe Transactions Periodically Fail
    
        Description: The BCM5300X PCIe does not maintain transaction ordering.
                     This may cause PCIe transaction failure.
        Fix Comment: Add a dummy PCIe configuration read after a PCIe
                     configuration write to ensure PCIe configuration access
                     ordering. Set ES bit of CP0 configu7 register to enable
                     sync function so that the sync instruction is functional.
        Resolution:  hndpci.c: extpci_write_config()
                     hndmips.c: si_mips_init()
                     mipsinc.h CONF7_ES
    
    This is fixed by the CFE MIPS bcmsi chipset driver also for BCM47XX.
    Also the dummy PCIe configuration read is already implemented in the
    Linux BCMA driver.
    
    Enable ExternalSync in Config7 when CONFIG_BCMA_DRIVER_PCI_HOSTMODE=y
    too so that the sync instruction is externalised.

    commit 1bc0299d976e000ececc6acd76e33b4582646cb7 upstream.
    
    The following code fails to allocate a buffer for the
    tail address that the hardware DMAs into when the user
    context DMA_RTAIL is set.
    
    if (HFI1_CAP_KGET_MASK(rcd->flags, DMA_RTAIL)) {
            rcd->rcvhdrtail_kvaddr = dma_zalloc_coherent(
                    &dd->pcidev->dev, PAGE_SIZE, &dma_hdrqtail,
                    gfp_flags);
            if (!rcd->rcvhdrtail_kvaddr)
                    goto bail_free;
            rcd->rcvhdrqtailaddr_dma = dma_hdrqtail;
    }
    
    So the rcvhdrtail_kvaddr would then be NULL.
    
    The mmap logic fails to check for a NULL rcvhdrtail_kvaddr.
    
    The fix is to test for both user and kernel DMA_TAIL options
    during the allocation as well as testing for a NULL
    rcvhdrtail_kvaddr during the mmap processing.
    
    Additionally, all downstream testing of the capmask for DMA_RTAIL
    have been eliminated in favor of testing rcvhdrtail_kvaddr.

    IB/hfi1: Optimize kthread pointer locking when queuing CQ entries
    
    commit af8aab71370a692eaf7e7969ba5b1a455ac20113 upstream.
    
    All threads queuing CQ entries on different CQs are unnecessarily
    synchronized by a spin lock to check if the CQ kthread worker hasn't
    been destroyed before queuing an CQ entry.
    
    The lock used in 6efaf10f163d ("IB/rdmavt: Avoid queuing work into a
    destroyed cq kthread worker") is a device global lock and will have
    poor performance at scale as completions are entered from a large
    number of CPUs.
    
    Convert to use RCU where the read side of RCU is rvt_cq_enter() to
    determine that the worker is alive prior to triggering the
    completion event.
    Apply write side RCU semantics in rvt_driver_cq_init() and
    rvt_cq_exit().

    IB/hfi1: Reorder incorrect send context disable
    
    commit a93a0a31111231bb1949f4a83b17238f0fa32d6a upstream.
    
    User send context integrity bits are cleared before the context is
    disabled.  If the send context is still processing data, any packets
    that need those integrity bits will cause an error and halt the send
    context.
    
    During the disable handling, the driver waits for the context to drain.
    If the context is halted, the driver will eventually timeout because
    the context won't drain and then incorrectly bounce the link.
    
    Reorder the bit clearing and the context disable.
    
    Examine the software state and send context status as well as the
    egress status to determine if a send context is in the halted state.
    
    Promote the check macros to static functions for consistency with the
    new check and to follow kernel style.
    
    Remove an unused define that refers to the egress timeout.

    IB/hfi1: Fix fault injection init/exit issues
    
    commit 8c79d8223bb11b2f005695a32ddd3985de97727c upstream.
    
    There are config dependent code paths that expose panics in unload
    paths both in this file and in debugfs_remove_recursive() because
    CONFIG_FAULT_INJECTION and CONFIG_FAULT_INJECTION_DEBUG_FS can be
    set independently.
    
    Having CONFIG_FAULT_INJECTION set and CONFIG_FAULT_INJECTION_DEBUG_FS
    reset causes fault_create_debugfs_attr() to return an error.
    
    The debugfs.c routines tolerate failures, but the module unload panics
    dereferencing a NULL in the two exit routines.  If that is fixed, the
    dir passed to debugfs_remove_recursive comes from a memory location
    that was freed and potentially reused causing a segfault or corrupting
    memory.
    
    Here is an example of the NULL deref panic:

    Fix by insuring that upon failure from fault_create_debugfs_attr() the
    parent pointer for the routines is always set to NULL and guards added
    in the exit routines to insure that debugfs_remove_recursive() is not
    called when when the parent pointer is NULL.

    The code calls dma_sync on login_tx_desc->dma_addr prior to initializing it
    with dma-mapped address.
    login_tx_desc is a part of iser_conn structure and is used only once
    during login negotiation, so the issue is fixed by eliminating
    dma_sync call for this buffer using a special case routine.

    IB/mlx5: Fetch soft WQE's on fatal error state
    
    commit 7b74a83cf54a3747e22c57e25712bd70eef8acee upstream.
    
    On fatal error the driver simulates CQE's for ULPs that rely on
    completion of all their posted work-request.
    
    For the GSI traffic, the mlx5 has its own mechanism that sends the
    completions via software CQE's directly to the relevant CQ.
    
    This should be kept in fatal error too, so the driver should simulate
    such CQE's with the specified error state in order to complete GSI QP
    work requests.
    
    Without the fix the next deadlock might appears:

    IB/core: Make testing MR flags for writability a static inline function
    
    commit 08bb558ac11ab944e0539e78619d7b4c356278bd upstream.
    
    Make the MR writability flags check, which is performed in umem.c,
    a static inline function in file ib_verbs.h
    
    This allows the function to be used by low-level infiniband drivers.

    IB/mlx4: Mark user MR as writable if actual virtual memory is writable
    
    commit d8f9cc328c8888369880e2527e9186d745f2bbf6 upstream.
    
    To allow rereg_user_mr to modify the MR from read-only to writable without
    using get_user_pages again, we needed to define the initial MR as writable.
    However, this was originally done unconditionally, without taking into
    account the writability of the underlying virtual memory.
    
    As a result, any attempt to register a read-only MR over read-only
    virtual memory failed.
    
    To fix this, do not add the writable flag bit when the user virtual memory
    is not writable (e.g. const memory).
    
    However, when the underlying memory is NOT writable (and we therefore
    do not define the initial MR as writable), the IB core adds a
    "force writable" flag to its user-pages request. If this succeeds,
    the reg_user_mr caller gets a writable copy of the original pages.
    
    If the user-space caller then does a rereg_user_mr operation to enable
    writability, this will succeed. This should not be allowed, since
    the original virtual memory was not writable.

    IB/{hfi1, qib}: Add handling of kernel restart
    
    commit 8d3e71136a080d007620472f50c7b3e63ba0f5cf upstream.
    
    A warm restart will fail to unload the driver, leaving link state
    potentially flapping up to the point the BIOS resets the adapter.
    Correct the issue by hooking the shutdown pci method,
    which will bring port down.

    The code calls a qib_map_page() which has never correctly tested for a

    handling the failure in the caller.
    
    Additionally, streamline qib_map_page() arguments to satisfy just
    the single caller.

    tpm: fix race condition in tpm_common_write()
    
    commit 3ab2011ea368ec3433ad49e1b9e1c7b70d2e65df upstream.
    
    There is a race condition in tpm_common_write function allowing
    two threads on the same /dev/tpm<N>, or two different applications
    on the same /dev/tpmrm<N> to overwrite each other commands/responses.
    Fixed this by taking the priv->buffer_mutex early in the function.
    
    Also converted the priv->data_pending from atomic to a regular size_t
    type. There is no need for it to be atomic since it is only touched
    under the protection of the priv->buffer_mutex.

    of: platform: stop accessing invalid dev in of_platform_device_destroy
    
    commit 522811e944ed9b36806faa019faec10f9d259cca upstream.
    
    Immediately after the platform_device_unregister() the device will be
    cleaned up. Accessing the freed pointer immediately after that will
    crash the system.
    
    Found this bug when kernel is built with CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING and testing
    loading/unloading audio drivers in a loop on Qcom platforms.
    
    Fix this by moving of_node_clear_flag() just before the unregister calls.

    For strings, account for trailing \0 in property length field:
    
    This is consistent with how dtc builds string properties.
    
    Function __of_prop_dup() would misbehave on such properties as it duplicates
    properties based on the property length field creating new string values
    without trailing \0s.

    ARM64: dts: meson: disable sd-uhs modes on the libretech-cc
    
    commit d5b4885b1dff72ac670b518cfeaac719d768bd4d upstream.
    
    There is a problem with the sd-uhs mode when doing a soft reboot.
    Switching back from 1.8v to 3.3v messes with the card, which no longer
    respond (timeout errors). According to the specification, we should
    perform a card reset (power cycling the card) but this is something we
    cannot control on this design.
    
    Then the only solution to restore the communication with the card is an
    "unplug-plug" which is not acceptable
    
    Until we find a solution, if any, disable the sd-uhs modes on this design.
    For the people using uhs at the moment, there will a performance drop as
    a result.

    commit 71c8fc0c96abf8e53e74ed4d891d671e585f9076 upstream.
    
    When rewriting swapper using nG mappings, we must performance cache
    maintenance around each page table access in order to avoid coherency
    problems with the host's cacheable alias under KVM. To ensure correct
    ordering of the maintenance with respect to Device memory accesses made
    with the Stage-1 MMU disabled, DMBs need to be added between the
    maintenance and the corresponding memory access.
    
    This patch adds a missing DMB between writing a new page table entry and
    performing a clean+invalidate on the same line.

    arm64: Fix syscall restarting around signal suppressed by tracer
    
    commit 0fe42512b2f03f9e5a20b9f55ef1013a68b4cd48 upstream.
    
    Commit 17c2895 ("arm64: Abstract syscallno manipulation") abstracts
    out the pt_regs.syscallno value for a syscall cancelled by a tracer
    as NO_SYSCALL, and provides helpers to set and check for this
    condition.  However, the way this was implemented has the
    unintended side-effect of disabling part of the syscall restart
    logic.
    
    This comes about because the second in_syscall() check in
    do_signal() re-evaluates the "in a syscall" condition based on the
    updated pt_regs instead of the original pt_regs.  forget_syscall()
    is explicitly called prior to the second check in order to prevent
    restart logic in the ret_to_user path being spuriously triggered,
    which means that the second in_syscall() check always yields false.
    
    This triggers a failure in
    tools/testing/selftests/seccomp/seccomp_bpf.c, when using ptrace to
    suppress a signal that interrups a nanosleep() syscall.
    
    Misbehaviour of this type is only expected in the case where a
    tracer suppresses a signal and the target process is either being
    single-stepped or the interrupted syscall attempts to restart via
    -ERESTARTBLOCK.
    
    This patch restores the old behaviour by performing the
    in_syscall() check only once at the start of the function.

    ARM: 8764/1: kgdb: fix NUMREGBYTES so that gdb_regs[] is the correct size
    
    commit 76ed0b803a2ab793a1b27d1dfe0de7955282cd34 upstream.
    
    NUMREGBYTES (which is used as the size for gdb_regs[]) is incorrectly
    based on DBG_MAX_REG_NUM instead of GDB_MAX_REGS. DBG_MAX_REG_NUM
    is the number of total registers, while GDB_MAX_REGS is the number
    of 'unsigned longs' it takes to serialize those registers. Since
    FP registers require 3 'unsigned longs' each, DBG_MAX_REG_NUM is
    smaller than GDB_MAX_REGS.
    
    This causes GDB 8.0 give the following error on connect:
    "Truncated register 19 in remote 'g' packet"
    
    This also causes the register serialization/deserialization logic
    to overflow gdb_regs[], overwriting whatever follows.

    cxl: Disable prefault_mode in Radix mode
    
    commit b6c84ba22ff3a198eb8d5552cf9b8fda1d792e54 upstream.
    
    Currently we see a kernel-oops reported on Power-9 while attaching a
    context to an AFU, with radix-mode and sysfs attr 'prefault_mode' set
    to anything other than 'none'. The backtrace of the oops is of this
    form:
    
      Unable to handle kernel paging request for data at address 0x00000080
      Faulting instruction address: 0xc00800000bcf3b20

      sys_ioctl+0x40/0xa0
      system_call+0x58/0x6c
    
    The issue is caused as on Power-8 the AFU attr 'prefault_mode' was
    used to improve initial storage fault performance by prefaulting
    process segments. However on Power-9 with radix mode we don't have
    Storage-Segments that we can prefault. Also prefaulting process Pages
    will be too costly and fine-grained.
    
    Hence, since the prefaulting mechanism doesn't makes sense of
    radix-mode, this patch updates prefault_mode_store() to not allow any
    other value apart from CXL_PREFAULT_NONE when radix mode is enabled.

    powerpc/fadump: Unregister fadump on kexec down path.
    
    commit 722cde76d68e8cc4f3de42e71c82fd40dea4f7b9 upstream.
    
    Unregister fadump on kexec down path otherwise the fadump registration
    in new kexec-ed kernel complains that fadump is already registered.
    This makes new kernel to continue using fadump registered by previous
    kernel which may lead to invalid vmcore generation. Hence this patch
    fixes this issue by un-registering fadump in fadump_cleanup() which is
    called during kexec path so that new kernel can register fadump with
    new valid values.

    cpuidle: powernv: Fix promotion from snooze if next state disabled
    
    commit 0a4ec6aa035a52c422eceb2ed51ed88392a3d6c2 upstream.
    
    The commit 78eaa10f027c ("cpuidle: powernv/pseries: Auto-promotion of
    snooze to deeper idle state") introduced a timeout for the snooze idle
    state so that it could be eventually be promoted to a deeper idle
    state. The snooze timeout value is static and set to the target
    residency of the next idle state, which would train the cpuidle
    governor to pick the next idle state eventually.
    
    The unfortunate side-effect of this is that if the next idle state(s)
    is disabled, the CPU will forever remain in snooze, despite the fact
    that the system is completely idle, and other deeper idle states are
    available.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by dynamically setting the snooze timeout
    to the target residency of the next enabled state on the device.

    commit ac9816dcbab53c57bcf1d7b15370b08f1e284318 upstream.
    
    Init all present cpus for deep states instead of "all possible" cpus.
    Init fails if a possible cpu is guarded. Resulting in making only
    non-deep states available for cpuidle/hotplug.
    
    Stewart says, this means that for single threaded workloads, if you
    guard out a CPU core you'll not get WoF (Workload Optimised
    Frequency), which means that performance goes down when you wouldn't
    expect it to.

    powerpc/powernv: copy/paste - Mask SO bit in CR
    
    commit 75743649064ec0cf5ddd69f240ef23af66dde16e upstream.
    
    NX can set the 3rd bit in CR register for XER[SO] (Summary overflow)
    which is not related to paste request. The current paste function
    returns failure for a successful request when this bit is set. So mask
    this bit and check the proper return status.

    powerpc/powernv/ioda2: Remove redundant free of TCE pages
    
    commit 98fd72fe82527fd26618062b60cfd329451f2329 upstream.
    
    When IODA2 creates a PE, it creates an IOMMU table with it_ops::free
    set to pnv_ioda2_table_free() which calls pnv_pci_ioda2_table_free_pages().
    
    Since iommu_tce_table_put() calls it_ops::free when the last reference
    to the table is released, explicit call to pnv_pci_ioda2_table_free_pages()
    is not needed so let's remove it.
    
    This should fix double free in the case of PCI hotuplug as
    pnv_pci_ioda2_table_free_pages() does not reset neither
    iommu_table::it_base nor ::it_size.
    
    This was not exposed by SRIOV as it uses different code path via
    pnv_pcibios_sriov_disable().
    
    IODA1 does not inialize it_ops::free so it does not have this issue.

    powerpc/ptrace: Fix enforcement of DAWR constraints
    
    commit cd6ef7eebf171bfcba7dc2df719c2a4958775040 upstream.
    
    Back when we first introduced the DAWR, in commit 4ae7ebe9522a
    ("powerpc: Change hardware breakpoint to allow longer ranges"), we
    screwed up the constraint making it a 1024 byte boundary rather than a
    512. This makes the check overly permissive. Fortunately GDB is the
    only real user and it always did they right thing, so we never
    noticed.
    
    This fixes the constraint to 512 bytes.

    powerpc/perf: Fix memory allocation for core-imc based on num_possible_cpus()
    
    commit d2032678e57fc508d7878307badde8f89b632ba3 upstream.
    
    Currently memory is allocated for core-imc based on cpu_present_mask,
    which has bit 'cpu' set iff cpu is populated. We use (cpu number / threads
    per core) as the array index to access the memory.
    
    Under some circumstances firmware marks a CPU as GUARDed CPU and boot the
    system, until cleared of errors, these CPU's are unavailable for all
    subsequent boots. GUARDed CPUs are possible but not present from linux
    view, so it blows a hole when we assume the max length of our allocation
    is driven by our max present cpus, where as one of the cpus might be online
    and be beyond the max present cpus, due to the hole.
    So (cpu number / threads per core) value bounds the array index and leads
    to memory overflow.

    powerpc/ptrace: Fix setting 512B aligned breakpoints with PTRACE_SET_DEBUGREG
    
    commit 4f7c06e26ec9cf7fe9f0c54dc90079b6a4f4b2c3 upstream.
    
    In commit e2a800beaca1 ("powerpc/hw_brk: Fix off by one error when
    validating DAWR region end") we fixed setting the DAWR end point to
    its max value via PPC_PTRACE_SETHWDEBUG. Unfortunately we broke
    PTRACE_SET_DEBUGREG when setting a 512 byte aligned breakpoint.
    
    PTRACE_SET_DEBUGREG currently sets the length of the breakpoint to
    zero (memset() in hw_breakpoint_init()). This worked with
    arch_validate_hwbkpt_settings() before the above patch was applied but
    is now broken if the breakpoint is 512byte aligned.
    
    This sets the length of the breakpoint to 8 bytes when using
    PTRACE_SET_DEBUGREG.

    powerpc/mm/hash: Add missing isync prior to kernel stack SLB switch
    
    commit 91d06971881f71d945910de128658038513d1b24 upstream.
    
    Currently we do not have an isync, or any other context synchronizing
    instruction prior to the slbie/slbmte in _switch() that updates the
    SLB entry for the kernel stack.
    
    However that is not correct as outlined in the ISA.
    
    From Power ISA Version 3.0B, Book III, Chapter 11, page 1133:
    
      "Changing the contents of ... the contents of SLB entries ... can
       have the side effect of altering the context in which data
       addresses and instruction addresses are interpreted, and in which
       instructions are executed and data accesses are performed.
       ...
       These side effects need not occur in program order, and therefore
       may require explicit synchronization by software.
       ...
       The synchronizing instruction before the context-altering
       instruction ensures that all instructions up to and including that
       synchronizing instruction are fetched and executed in the context
       that existed before the alteration."
    
    And page 1136:
    
      "For data accesses, the context synchronizing instruction before the
       slbie, slbieg, slbia, slbmte, tlbie, or tlbiel instruction ensures
       that all preceding instructions that access data storage have
       completed to a point at which they have reported all exceptions
       they will cause."
    
    We're not aware of any bugs caused by this, but it should be fixed
    regardless.
    
    Add the missing isync when updating kernel stack SLB entry.

    fuse: fix control dir setup and teardown
    
    commit 6becdb601bae2a043d7fb9762c4d48699528ea6e upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting NULL pointer dereference at fuse_ctl_remove_conn() [1].
    Since fc->ctl_ndents is incremented by fuse_ctl_add_conn() when new_inode()
    failed, fuse_ctl_remove_conn() reaches an inode-less dentry and tries to
    clear d_inode(dentry)->i_private field.
    
    Fix by only adding the dentry to the array after being fully set up.
    
    When tearing down the control directory, do d_invalidate() on it to get rid
    of any mounts that might have been added.

    fuse: atomic_o_trunc should truncate pagecache
    
    commit df0e91d488276086bc07da2e389986cae0048c37 upstream.
    
    Fuse has an "atomic_o_trunc" mode, where userspace filesystem uses the
    O_TRUNC flag in the OPEN request to truncate the file atomically with the
    open.
    
    In this mode there's no need to send a SETATTR request to userspace after
    the open, so fuse_do_setattr() checks this mode and returns.  But this
    misses the important step of truncating the pagecache.
    
    Add the missing parts of truncation to the ATTR_OPEN branch.

    fuse: fix congested state leak on aborted connections
    
    commit 8a301eb16d99983a4961f884690ec97b92e7dcfe upstream.
    
    If a connection gets aborted while congested, FUSE can leave
    nr_wb_congested[] stuck until reboot causing wait_iff_congested() to
    wait spuriously which can lead to severe performance degradation.
    
    The leak is caused by gating congestion state clearing with
    fc->connected test in request_end().  This was added way back in 2009
    by 26c3679101db ("fuse: destroy bdi on umount").  While the commit
    description doesn't explain why the test was added, it most likely was
    to avoid dereferencing bdi after it got destroyed.
    
    Since then, bdi lifetime rules have changed many times and now we're
    always guaranteed to have access to the bdi while the superblock is
    alive (fc->sb).
    
    Drop fc->connected conditional to avoid leaking congestion states.

    branch-check: fix long->int truncation when profiling branches
    
    commit 2026d35741f2c3ece73c11eb7e4a15d7c2df9ebe upstream.
    
    The function __builtin_expect returns long type (see the gcc
    documentation), and so do macros likely and unlikely. Unfortunatelly, when
    CONFIG_PROFILE_ANNOTATED_BRANCHES is selected, the macros likely and
    unlikely expand to __branch_check__ and __branch_check__ truncates the
    long type to int. This unintended truncation may cause bugs in various
    kernel code (we found a bug in dm-writecache because of it), so it's
    better to fix __branch_check__ to return long.

    mips: ftrace: fix static function graph tracing
    
    commit 6fb8656646f996d1eef42e6d56203c4915cb9e08 upstream.
    
    ftrace_graph_caller was never run after calling ftrace_trace_function,
    breaking the function graph tracer. Fix this, bringing it in line with the
    x86 implementation.
    
    While we're at it, also streamline the control flow of _mcount a bit to
    reduce the number of branches.

    ftrace/selftest: Have the reset_trigger code be a bit more careful
    
    commit 756b56a9e832e063edc83be7c3889e98c536dd2b upstream.
    
    The trigger code is picky in how it can be disabled as there may be
    dependencies between different events and synthetic events. Change the order
    on how triggers are reset.
    
     1) Reset triggers of all synthetic events first
     2) Remove triggers with actions attached to them
     3) Remove all other triggers
    
    If this order isn't followed, then some triggers will not be reset, and an
    error may happen because a trigger is busy.

    lib/vsprintf: Remove atomic-unsafe support for %pCr
    
    commit 666902e42fd8344b923c02dc5b0f37948ff4f225 upstream.
    
    "%pCr" formats the current rate of a clock, and calls clk_get_rate().
    The latter obtains a mutex, hence it must not be called from atomic
    context.
    
    Remove support for this rarely-used format, as vsprintf() (and e.g.
    printk()) must be callable from any context.
    
    Any remaining out-of-tree users will start seeing the clock's name
    printed instead of its rate.

    According to "EP93xx User’s Guide", I2STXLinCtrlData and I2SRXLinCtrlData
    registers actually have different format. The only currently used bit
    (Left_Right_Justify) has different position. Fix this and simplify the
    whole setup taking into account the fact that both registers have zero
    default value.
    
    The practical effect of the above is repaired SND_SOC_DAIFMT_RIGHT_J

    Previously card drivers which specified SND_SOC_DAIFMT_NB_IF actually got

    PM / OPP: Update voltage in case freq == old_freq
    
    commit c5c2a97b3ac7d1ec19e7cff9e38caca6afefc3de upstream.
    
    This commit fixes a rare but possible case when the clk rate is updated
    without update of the regulator voltage.
    
    At boot up, CPUfreq checks if the system is running at the right freq. This
    is a sanity check in case a bootloader set clk rate that is outside of freq
    table present with cpufreq core. In such cases system can be unstable so
    better to change it to a freq that is preset in freq-table.
    
    The CPUfreq takes next freq that is >= policy->cur and this is our
    target_freq that needs to be set now.
    
    dev_pm_opp_set_rate(dev, target_freq) checks the target_freq and the
    old_freq (a current rate). If these are equal it returns early. If not,
    it searches for OPP (old_opp) that fits best to old_freq (not listed in
    the table) and updates old_freq (!).
    
    Here, we can end up with old_freq = old_opp.rate = target_freq, which
    is not handled in _generic_set_opp_regulator(). It's supposed to update
    voltage only when freq > old_freq  || freq > old_freq.
    
    if (freq > old_freq) {
                    ret = _set_opp_voltage(dev, reg, new_supply);
    [...]
    if (freq < old_freq) {
                    ret = _set_opp_voltage(dev, reg, new_supply);
                    if (ret)
    
    It results in, no voltage update while clk rate is updated.
    
    Example:
    freq-table = {
            1000MHz   1.15V
             666MHZ   1.10V
             333MHz   1.05V
    }
    boot-up-freq        = 800MHz   # not listed in freq-table
    freq = target_freq  = 1GHz
    old_freq            = 800Mhz
    old_opp = _find_freq_ceil(opp_table, &old_freq);  #(old_freq is modified!)
    old_freq            = 1GHz

    PM / core: Fix supplier device runtime PM usage counter imbalance
    
    commit 47e5abfb546a3ace23a77453dc2e9db92704c5ac upstream.
    
    If a device link is added via device_link_add() by the driver of the
    link's consumer device, the supplier's runtime PM usage counter is
    going to be dropped by the pm_runtime_put_suppliers() call in
    driver_probe_device().  However, in that case it is not incremented
    unless the supplier driver is already present and the link is not
    stateless.  That leads to a runtime PM usage counter imbalance for
    the supplier device in a few cases.
    
    To prevent that from happening, bump up the supplier runtime
    PM usage counter in device_link_add() for all links with the
    DL_FLAG_PM_RUNTIME flag set that are added at the consumer probe
    time.  Use pm_runtime_get_noresume() for that as the callers of
    device_link_add() who want the supplier to be resumed by it are
    expected to pass DL_FLAG_RPM_ACTIVE in flags to it anyway, but
    additionally resume the supplier if the link is added during
    consumer driver probe to retain the existing behavior for the
    callers depending on it.

    PM / Domains: Fix error path during attach in genpd
    
    commit 72038df3c580c4c326b83c86149d7ac34007532a upstream.
    
    In case the PM domain fails to be powered on in genpd_dev_pm_attach(), it
    returns -EPROBE_DEFER, but keeping the device attached to its PM domain.
    This leads to problems when the next attempt to attach is re-tried. More
    precisely, in that situation an -EEXIST error code is returned, because the
    device already has its PM domain pointer assigned, from the first attempt.
    
    Now, because of the sloppy error handling by the existing callers of
    dev_pm_domain_attach(), probing is allowed to continue when -EEXIST is
    returned. However, in such case there are no guarantees that the PM domain
    is powered on by genpd, which may lead to hangs when buses/drivers tried to
    access their devices.
    
    Let's fix this behaviour, simply by detaching the device when powering on
    fails in genpd_dev_pm_attach().

    signal/xtensa: Consistenly use SIGBUS in do_unaligned_user
    
    commit 7de712ccc096b81d23cc0a941cd9b8cb3956605d upstream.
    
    While working on changing this code to use force_sig_fault I
    discovered that do_unaliged_user is sets si_signo to SIGBUS and passes
    SIGSEGV to force_sig_info.  Which is just b0rked.
    
    The code is reporting a SIGBUS error so replace the SIGSEGV with SIGBUS.

    serial: sh-sci: Use spin_{try}lock_irqsave instead of open coding version
    
    commit 8afb1d2c12163f77777f84616a8e9444d0050ebe upstream.
    
    Commit 40f70c03e33a ("serial: sh-sci: add locking to console write
    function to avoid SMP lockup") copied the strategy to avoid locking
    problems in conjuncture with the console from the UART8250
    driver. Instead using directly spin_{try}lock_irqsave(),
    local_irq_save() followed by spin_{try}lock() was used. While this is
    correct on mainline, for -rt it is a problem. spin_{try}lock() will
    check if it is running in a valid context. Since the local_irq_save()
    has already been executed, the context has changed and
    spin_{try}lock() will complain. The reason why spin_{try}lock()
    complains is that on -rt the spin locks are turned into mutexes and
    therefore can sleep. Sleeping with interrupts disabled is not valid.

    m68k/mm: Adjust VM area to be unmapped by gap size for __iounmap()
    
    commit 3f90f9ef2dda316d64e420d5d51ba369587ccc55 upstream.
    
    If 020/030 support is enabled, get_io_area() leaves an IO_SIZE gap
    between mappings which is added to the vm_struct representing the
    mapping.  __ioremap() uses the actual requested size (after alignment),
    while __iounmap() is passed the size from the vm_struct.
    
    On 020/030, early termination descriptors are used to set up mappings of
    extent 'size', which are validated on unmapping. The unmapped gap of
    size IO_SIZE defeats the sanity check of the pmd tables, causing
    __iounmap() to loop forever on 030.
    
    On 040/060, unmapping of page table entries does not check for a valid
    mapping, so the umapping loop always completes there.
    
    Adjust size to be unmapped by the gap that had been added in the
    vm_struct prior.
    
    This fixes the hang in atari_platform_init() reported a long time ago,
    and a similar one reported by Finn recently (addressed by removing
    ioremap() use from the SWIM driver.
    
    Tested on my Falcon in 030 mode - untested but should work the same on
    040/060 (the extra page tables cleared there would never have been set
    up anyway).

    x86: Call fixup_exception() before notify_die() in math_error()
    
    commit 3ae6295ccb7cf6d344908209701badbbbb503e40 upstream.
    
    fpu__drop() has an explicit fwait which under some conditions can trigger a
    fixable FPU exception while in kernel. Thus, we should attempt to fixup the
    exception first, and only call notify_die() if the fixup failed just like
    in do_general_protection(). The original call sequence incorrectly triggers
    KDB entry on debug kernels under particular FPU-intensive workloads.
    
    Andy noted, that this makes the whole conditional irq enable thing even
    more inconsistent, but fixing that it outside the scope of this.

    x86/mce: Do not overwrite MCi_STATUS in mce_no_way_out()
    
    commit 1f74c8a64798e2c488f86efc97e308b85fb7d7aa upstream.
    
    mce_no_way_out() does a quick check during #MC to see whether some of
    the MCEs logged would require the kernel to panic immediately. And it
    passes a struct mce where MCi_STATUS gets written.
    
    However, after having saved a valid status value, the next iteration
    of the loop which goes over the MCA banks on the CPU, overwrites the
    valid status value because we're using struct mce as storage instead of
    a temporary variable.
    
    Which leads to MCE records with an empty status value:
    
      mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 6 Bank 0: 0000000000000000
      mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP 10:<ffffffffbd42fbd7> {trigger_mce+0x7/0x10}
    
    In order to prevent the loss of the status register value, return
    immediately when severity is a panic one so that we can panic
    immediately with the first fatal MCE logged. This is also the intention
    of this function and not to noodle over the banks while a fatal MCE is
    already logged.
    
    Tony: read the rest of the MCA bank to populate the struct mce fully.

    x86/mce: Fix incorrect "Machine check from unknown source" message
    
    commit 40c36e2741d7fe1e66d6ec55477ba5fd19c9c5d2 upstream.
    
    Some injection testing resulted in the following console log:
    
      mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 22: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 1: bd80000000100134
      mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP 10:<ffffffffc05292dd> {pmem_do_bvec+0x11d/0x330 [nd_pmem]}
      mce: [Hardware Error]: TSC c51a63035d52 ADDR 3234bc4000 MISC 88

      mce: [Hardware Error]: Run the above through 'mcelog --ascii'
      Kernel panic - not syncing: Machine check from unknown source
    
    This confused everybody because the first line quite clearly shows
    that we found a logged error in "Bank 1", while the last line says
    "unknown source".
    
    The problem is that the Linux code doesn't do the right thing
    for a local machine check that results in a fatal error.
    
    It turns out that we know very early in the handler whether the
    machine check is fatal. The call to mce_no_way_out() has checked
    all the banks for the CPU that took the local machine check. If
    it says we must crash, we can do so right away with the right
    messages.
    
    We do scan all the banks again. This means that we might initially
    not see a problem, but during the second scan find something fatal.
    If this happens we print a slightly different message (so I can
    see if it actually every happens).

    x86/mce: Check for alternate indication of machine check recovery on Skylake
    
    commit 4c5717da1d021cf368eabb3cb1adcaead56c0d1e upstream.
    
    Currently we just check the "CAPID0" register to see whether the CPU
    can recover from machine checks.
    
    But there are also some special SKUs which do not have all advanced
    RAS features, but do enable machine check recovery for use with NVDIMMs.
    
    Add a check for any of bits {8:5} in the "CAPID5" register (each
    reports some NVDIMM mode available, if any of them are set, then
    the system supports memory machine check recovery).

    x86/mce: Improve error message when kernel cannot recover
    
    commit c7d606f560e4c698884697fef503e4abacdd8c25 upstream.
    
    Since we added support to add recovery from some errors inside the kernel in:
    
    commit b2f9d678e28c ("x86/mce: Check for faults tagged in EXTABLE_CLASS_FAULT exception table entries")
    
    we have done a less than stellar job at reporting the cause of recoverable
    machine checks that occur in other parts of the kernel. The user just gets
    the unhelpful message:
    
            mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Action required: unknown MCACOD
    
    doubly unhelpful when they check the manual for the reported IA32_MSR_STATUS.MCACOD
    and see that it is listed as one of the standard recoverable values.
    
    Add an extra rule to the MCE severity table to catch this case and report it
    as:
    
            mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Data load in unrecoverable area of kernel

    x86/spectre_v1: Disable compiler optimizations over array_index_mask_nospec()
    
    commit eab6870fee877258122a042bfd99ee7908c40280 upstream.
    
    Mark Rutland noticed that GCC optimization passes have the potential to elide
    necessary invocations of the array_index_mask_nospec() instruction sequence,
    so mark the asm() volatile.
    
    Mark explains:
    
    "The volatile will inhibit *some* cases where the compiler could lift the
     array_index_nospec() call out of a branch, e.g. where there are multiple
     invocations of array_index_nospec() with the same arguments:
    
            if (idx < foo) {
                    idx1 = array_idx_nospec(idx, foo)
                    do_something(idx1);
            }
    
            < some other code >
    
            if (idx < foo) {
                    idx2 = array_idx_nospec(idx, foo);
                    do_something_else(idx2);
            }
    
     ... since the compiler can determine that the two invocations yield the same
     result, and reuse the first result (likely the same register as idx was in
     originally) for the second branch, effectively re-writing the above as:
    
            if (idx < foo) {
                    idx = array_idx_nospec(idx, foo);
                    do_something(idx);
            }
    
            < some other code >
    
            if (idx < foo) {
                    do_something_else(idx);
            }
    
     ... if we don't take the first branch, then speculatively take the second, we
     lose the nospec protection.
    
     There's more info on volatile asm in the GCC docs:
