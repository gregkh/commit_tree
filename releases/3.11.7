    commit d969de8d83401683420638c8107dcfedb2146f37 upstream.
    
    Due to missing braces on an if statement, in presence of a device_node a
    port was always assigned -1, regardless of any alias entries in the
    device tree. Conversely, if device_node was NULL, an unitialized port
    ended up being used.
    
    This patch adds the missing braces, fixing the issues.

    cw1200_irq_handler() expects the hwbus to be locked, but on the

    wireless: radiotap: fix parsing buffer overrun
    
    commit f5563318ff1bde15b10e736e97ffce13be08bc1a upstream.
    
    When parsing an invalid radiotap header, the parser can overrun
    the buffer that is passed in because it doesn't correctly check
     1) the minimum radiotap header size
     2) the space for extended bitmaps
    
    The first issue doesn't affect any in-kernel user as they all
    check the minimum size before calling the radiotap function.
    The second issue could potentially affect the kernel if an skb
    is passed in that consists only of the radiotap header with a
    lot of extended bitmaps that extend past the SKB. In that case
    a read-only buffer overrun by at most 4 bytes is possible.
    
    Fix this by adding the appropriate checks to the parser.

    Since pause is bounded by [min_pause, max_pause] where min_pause is also
    bounded by max_pause.  It's suspected and demonstrated that the
    max_pause calculation goes wrong:
    
            ick: pause : -717
            ick: min_pause : -177
            ick: max_pause : -717
            ick: pages_dirtied : 14
            ick: task_ratelimit: 0
    
    The problem lies in the two "long = unsigned long" assignments in
    bdi_max_pause() which might go negative if the highest bit is 1, and the
    min_t(long, ...) check failed to protect it falling under 0.  Fix all of
    them by using "unsigned long" throughout the function.

    ALSA: hda - Fix inverted internal mic not indicated on some machines
    
    commit ccb041571b73888785ef7828a276e380125891a4 upstream.
    
    The create_bind_cap_vol_ctl does not create any control indicating
    that an inverted dmic is present. Therefore, create multiple
    capture volumes in this scenario, so we always have some indication
    that the internal mic is inverted.
    
    This happens on the Lenovo Ideapad U310 as well as the Lenovo Yoga 13
    (both are based on the CX20590 codec), but the fix is generic and
    could be needed for other codecs/machines too.
    
    Thanks to Szymon Acedański for the pointer and a draft patch.

    ALSA: us122l: Fix pcm_usb_stream mmapping regression
    
    commit ac536a848a1643e4b87e8fbd376a63091afc2ccc upstream.
    
    The pcm_usb_stream plugin requires the mremap explicitly for the read
    buffer, as it expands itself once after reading the required size.
    But the commit [314e51b9: mm: kill vma flag VM_RESERVED and
    mm->reserved_vm counter] converted blindly to a combination of
    VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_DONTDUMP like other normal drivers, and this
    resulted in the failure of mremap().
    
    For fixing this regression, we need to remove VM_DONTEXPAND for the
    read-buffer mmap.

    It's invalid: we don't always have down_write of mmap_sem there: a racing
    do_huge_pmd_wp_page() might have copied-on-write to another huge page
    before our split_huge_page() got the anon_vma lock.

    Consider the following scenario:

    thread 1: call zswap_frontswap_invalidate_page to invalidate entry x.
            finished, entry x and its zbud is not freed as its refcount != 0
            now, the swap_map[x] = 0
    thread 0: now call zswap_get_swap_cache_page
            swapcache_prepare return -ENOENT because entry x is not used any more
            zswap_get_swap_cache_page return ZSWAP_SWAPCACHE_NOMEM
            zswap_writeback_entry do nothing except put refcount
    Now, the memory of zswap_entry x and its zpage leak.
    
    Modify:
     - check the refcount in fail path, free memory if it is not referenced.
    
     - use ZSWAP_SWAPCACHE_FAIL instead of ZSWAP_SWAPCACHE_NOMEM as the fail path
       can be not only caused by nomem but also by invalidate.

    dm snapshot: fix data corruption
    
    commit e9c6a182649f4259db704ae15a91ac820e63b0ca upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a particular type of data corruption that has been
    encountered when loading a snapshot's metadata from disk.
    
    When we allocate a new chunk in persistent_prepare, we increment
    ps->next_free and we make sure that it doesn't point to a metadata area
    by further incrementing it if necessary.
    
    When we load metadata from disk on device activation, ps->next_free is
    positioned after the last used data chunk. However, if this last used
    data chunk is followed by a metadata area, ps->next_free is positioned
    erroneously to the metadata area. A newly-allocated chunk is placed at
    the same location as the metadata area, resulting in data or metadata
    corruption.
    
    This patch changes the code so that ps->next_free skips the metadata
    area when metadata are loaded in function read_exceptions.
    
    The patch also moves a piece of code from persistent_prepare_exception
    to a separate function skip_metadata to avoid code duplication.

    gpio/lynxpoint: check if the interrupt is enabled in IRQ handler
    
    commit 03d152d5582abc8a1c19cb107164c3724bbd4be4 upstream.
    
    Checking LP_INT_STAT is not enough in the interrupt handler because its
    contents get updated regardless of whether the pin has interrupt enabled or
    not. This causes the driver to loop forever for GPIOs that are pulled up.
    
    Fix this by checking the interrupt enable bit for the pin as well.

    commit 29114fd7db2fc82a34da8340d29b8fa413e03dca upstream.
    
    This fixes a long-standing Integrator/CP regression from
    commit 870e2928cf3368ca9b06bc925d0027b0a56bcd8e
    "ARM: integrator-cp: convert use CLKSRC_OF for timer init"
    
    When this code was introduced, the both aliases pointing the
    system to use timer1 as primary (clocksource) and timer2
    as secondary (clockevent) was ignored, and the system would
    simply use the first two timers found as clocksource and
    clockevent.
    
    However this made the system timeline accelerate by a
    factor x25, as it turns out that the way the clocking
    actually works (totally undocumented and found after some
    trial-and-error) is that timer0 runs @ 25MHz and timer1
    and timer2 runs @ 1MHz. Presumably this divider setting
    is a boot-on default and configurable albeit the way to
    configure it is not documented.
    
    So as a quick fix to the problem, let's mark timer0 as
    disabled, so the code will chose timer1 and timer2 as it
    used to.
    
    This also deletes the two aliases for the primary and
    secondary timer as they have been superceded by the
    auto-selection

    ARM: 7851/1: check for number of arguments in syscall_get/set_arguments()
    
    commit 3c1532df5c1b54b5f6246cdef94eeb73a39fe43a upstream.
    
    In ftrace_syscall_enter(),
        syscall_get_arguments(..., 0, n, ...)
            if (i == 0) { <handle ORIG_r0> ...; n--;}
            memcpy(..., n * sizeof(args[0]));
    If 'number of arguments(n)' is zero and 'argument index(i)' is also zero in
    syscall_get_arguments(), none of arguments should be copied by memcpy().
    Otherwise 'n--' can be a big positive number and unexpected amount of data
    will be copied. Tracing system calls which take no argument, say sync(void),
    may hit this case and eventually make the system corrupted.
    This patch fixes the issue both in syscall_get_arguments() and
    syscall_set_arguments().

    davinci_emac.c: Fix IFF_ALLMULTI setup
    
    [ Upstream commit d69e0f7ea95fef8059251325a79c004bac01f018 ]
    
    When IFF_ALLMULTI flag is set on interface and IFF_PROMISC isn't,
    emac_dev_mcast_set should only enable RX of multicasts and reset
    MACHASH registers.
    
    It does this, but afterwards it either sets up multicast MACs
    filtering or disables RX of multicasts and resets MACHASH registers
    again, rendering IFF_ALLMULTI flag useless.
    
    This patch fixes emac_dev_mcast_set, so that multicast MACs filtering and
    disabling of RX of multicasts are skipped when IFF_ALLMULTI flag is set.
    
    Tested with kernel 2.6.37.

    Routes need to be probed asynchronous otherwise the call stack gets
    exhausted when the kernel attemps to deliver another skb inline, like
    e.g. xt_TEE does, and we probe at the same time.
    
    We update neigh->updated still at once, otherwise we would send to
    many probes.

    ipv6: always prefer rt6i_gateway if present
    
    [ Upstream commit 96dc809514fb2328605198a0602b67554d8cce7b ]
    
    In v3.9 6fd6ce2056de2709 ("ipv6: Do not depend on rt->n in
    ip6_finish_output2()." changed the behaviour of ip6_finish_output2()
    such that the recently introduced rt6_nexthop() is used
    instead of an assigned neighbor.
    
    As rt6_nexthop() prefers rt6i_gateway only for gatewayed
    routes this causes a problem for users like IPVS, xt_TEE and
    RAW(hdrincl) if they want to use different address for routing
    compared to the destination address.
    
    Another case is when redirect can create RTF_DYNAMIC
    route without RTF_GATEWAY flag, we ignore the rt6i_gateway
    in rt6_nexthop().
    
    Fix the above problems by considering the rt6i_gateway if
    present, so that traffic routed to address on local subnet is
    not wrongly diverted to the destination address.
    
    Thanks to Simon Horman and Phil Oester for spotting the
    problematic commit.

    inet: fix possible memory corruption with UDP_CORK and UFO
    
    [ This is a simplified -stable version of a set of upstream commits. ]
    
    This is a replacement patch only for stable which does fix the problems
    handled by the following two commits in -net:
    
    "ip_output: do skb ufo init for peeked non ufo skb as well" (e93b7d748be887cd7639b113ba7d7ef792a7efb9)
    "ip6_output: do skb ufo init for peeked non ufo skb as well" (c547dbf55d5f8cf615ccc0e7265e98db27d3fb8b)
    
    Three frames are written on a corked udp socket for which the output
    netdevice has UFO enabled.  If the first and third frame are smaller than
    the mtu and the second one is bigger, we enqueue the second frame with
    skb_append_datato_frags without initializing the gso fields. This leads
    to the third frame appended regulary and thus constructing an invalid skb.
    
    This fixes the problem by always using skb_append_datato_frags as soon
    as the first frag got enqueued to the skb without marking the packet
    as SKB_GSO_UDP.
    
    The problem with only two frames for ipv6 was fixed by "ipv6: udp
    packets following an UFO enqueued packet need also be handled by UFO"
    (2811ebac2521ceac84f2bdae402455baa6a7fb47).

    net: unix: inherit SOCK_PASS{CRED, SEC} flags from socket to fix race
    
    [ Upstream commit 90c6bd34f884cd9cee21f1d152baf6c18bcac949 ]
    
    In the case of credentials passing in unix stream sockets (dgram
    sockets seem not affected), we get a rather sparse race after
    commit 16e5726 ("af_unix: dont send SCM_CREDENTIALS by default").
    
    We have a stream server on receiver side that requests credential
    passing from senders (e.g. nc -U). Since we need to set SO_PASSCRED
    on each spawned/accepted socket on server side to 1 first (as it's
    not inherited), it can happen that in the time between accept() and
    setsockopt() we get interrupted, the sender is being scheduled and
    continues with passing data to our receiver. At that time SO_PASSCRED
    is neither set on sender nor receiver side, hence in cmsg's
    SCM_CREDENTIALS we get eventually pid:0, uid:65534, gid:65534
    (== overflow{u,g}id) instead of what we actually would like to see.
    
    On the sender side, here nc -U, the tests in maybe_add_creds()
    invoked through unix_stream_sendmsg() would fail, as at that exact
    time, as mentioned, the sender has neither SO_PASSCRED on his side
    nor sees it on the server side, and we have a valid 'other' socket
    in place. Thus, sender believes it would just look like a normal
    connection, not needing/requesting SO_PASSCRED at that time.
    
    As reverting 16e5726 would not be an option due to the significant
    performance regression reported when having creds always passed,
    one way/trade-off to prevent that would be to set SO_PASSCRED on
    the listener socket and allow inheriting these flags to the spawned
    socket on server side in accept(). It seems also logical to do so
    if we'd tell the listener socket to pass those flags onwards, and
    would fix the race.
    
    Before, strace:
    
    recvmsg(4, {msg_name(0)=NULL, msg_iov(1)=[{"blub\n", 4096}],
            msg_controllen=32, {cmsg_len=28, cmsg_level=SOL_SOCKET,
            cmsg_type=SCM_CREDENTIALS{pid=0, uid=65534, gid=65534}},
            msg_flags=0}, 0) = 5
    
    After, strace:
    
    recvmsg(4, {msg_name(0)=NULL, msg_iov(1)=[{"blub\n", 4096}],
            msg_controllen=32, {cmsg_len=28, cmsg_level=SOL_SOCKET,
            cmsg_type=SCM_CREDENTIALS{pid=11580, uid=1000, gid=1000}},
            msg_flags=0}, 0) = 5

    sctp: Perform software checksum if packet has to be fragmented.
    
    [ Upstream commit d2dbbba77e95dff4b4f901fee236fef6d9552072 ]
    
    IP/IPv6 fragmentation knows how to compute only TCP/UDP checksum.
    This causes problems if SCTP packets has to be fragmented and
    ipsummed has been set to PARTIAL due to checksum offload support.
    This condition can happen when retransmitting after MTU discover,
    or when INIT or other control chunks are larger then MTU.
    Check for the rare fragmentation condition in SCTP and use software
    checksum calculation in this case.

    virtio-net: don't respond to cpu hotplug notifier if we're not ready
    
    [ Upstream commit 3ab098df35f8b98b6553edc2e40234af512ba877 ]
    
    We're trying to re-configure the affinity unconditionally in cpu hotplug
    callback. This may lead the issue during resuming from s3/s4 since
    
    - virt queues haven't been allocated at that time.
    - it's unnecessary since thaw method will re-configure the affinity.
    
    Fix this issue by checking the config_enable and do nothing is we're not ready.
    
    The bug were introduced by commit 8de4b2f3ae90c8fc0f17eeaab87d5a951b66ee17
    (virtio-net: reset virtqueue affinity when doing cpu hotplug).

    bnx2x: record rx queue for LRO packets
    
    [ Upstream commit 60e66fee56b2256dcb1dc2ea1b2ddcb6e273857d ]
    
    RPS support is kind of broken on bnx2x, because only non LRO packets
    get proper rx queue information. This triggers reorders, as it seems
    bnx2x like to generate a non LRO packet for segment including TCP PUSH
    flag : (this might be pure coincidence, but all the reorders I've
    seen involve segments with a PUSH)

    We must call skb_record_rx_queue() to properly give to RPS (and more
    generally for TX queue selection on forward path) the receive queue
    information.
    
    Similar fix is needed for skb_mark_napi_id(), but will be handled
    in a separate patch to ease stable backports.

    connector: use nlmsg_len() to check message length
    
    [ Upstream commit 162b2bedc084d2d908a04c93383ba02348b648b0 ]
    
    The current code tests the length of the whole netlink message to be
    at least as long to fit a cn_msg. This is wrong as nlmsg_len includes
    the length of the netlink message header. Use nlmsg_len() instead to
    fix this "off-by-NLMSG_HDRLEN" size check.

    struct sync_serial_settings after the ->loopback member. Add an explicit
    memset(0) before filling the structure to avoid the info leak.

    l2tp: must disable bh before calling l2tp_xmit_skb()
    
    [ Upstream commit 455cc32bf128e114455d11ad919321ab89a2c312 ]
    
    François Cachereul made a very nice bug report and suspected
    the bh_lock_sock() / bh_unlok_sock() pair used in l2tp_xmit_skb() from
    process context was not good.
    
    This problem was added by commit 6af88da14ee284aaad6e4326da09a89191ab6165
    ("l2tp: Fix locking in l2tp_core.c").
    
    l2tp_eth_dev_xmit() runs from BH context, so we must disable BH
    from other l2tp_xmit_skb() users.

    vti: get rid of nf mark rule in prerouting
    
    [ Upstream commit 7263a5187f9e9de45fcb51349cf0e031142c19a1 ]
    
    This patch fixes and improves the use of vti interfaces (while
    lightly changing the way of configuring them).
    
    Currently:
    
    - it is necessary to identify and mark inbound IPsec
      packets destined to each vti interface, via netfilter rules in
      the mangle table at prerouting hook.
    
    - the vti module cannot retrieve the right tunnel in input since
      commit b9959fd3: vti tunnels all have an i_key, but the tunnel lookup
      is done with flag TUNNEL_NO_KEY, so there no chance to retrieve them.
    
    - the i_key is used by the outbound processing as a mark to lookup
      for the right SP and SA bundle.
    
    This patch uses the o_key to store the vti mark (instead of i_key) and
    enables:
    
    - to avoid the need for previously marking the inbound skbuffs via a
      netfilter rule.
    - to properly retrieve the right tunnel in input, only based on the IPsec
      packet outer addresses.
    - to properly perform an inbound policy check (using the tunnel o_key
      as a mark).
    - to properly perform an outbound SPD and SAD lookup (using the tunnel
      o_key as a mark).
    - to keep the current mark of the skbuff. The skbuff mark is neither
      used nor changed by the vti interface. Only the vti interface o_key
      is used.
    
    SAs have a wildcard mark.
    SPs have a mark equal to the vti interface o_key.
    
    The vti interface must be created as follows (i_key = 0, o_key = mark):
    
       ip link add vti1 mode vti local 1.1.1.1 remote 2.2.2.2 okey 1
    
    The SPs attached to vti1 must be created as follows (mark = vti1 o_key):
    
       ip xfrm policy add dir out mark 1 tmpl src 1.1.1.1 dst 2.2.2.2 \
          proto esp mode tunnel
       ip xfrm policy add dir in  mark 1 tmpl src 2.2.2.2 dst 1.1.1.1 \
          proto esp mode tunnel
    
    The SAs are created with the default wildcard mark. There is no
    distinction between global vs. vti SAs. Just their addresses will
    possibly link them to a vti interface:
    
       ip xfrm state add src 1.1.1.1 dst 2.2.2.2 proto esp spi 1000 mode tunnel \
                     enc "cbc(aes)" "azertyuiopqsdfgh"
    
       ip xfrm state add src 2.2.2.2 dst 1.1.1.1 proto esp spi 2000 mode tunnel \
                     enc "cbc(aes)" "sqbdhgqsdjqjsdfh"
    
    To avoid matching "global" (not vti) SPs in vti interfaces, global SPs
    should no use the default wildcard mark, but explicitly match mark 0.
    
    To avoid a double SPD lookup in input and output (in global and vti SPDs),
    the NOPOLICY and NOXFRM options should be set on the vti interfaces:
    
       echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/vti1/disable_policy
       echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/vti1/disable_xfrm
    
    The outgoing traffic is steered to vti1 by a route via the vti interface:
    
       ip route add 192.168.0.0/16 dev vti1
    
    The incoming IPsec traffic is steered to vti1 because its outer addresses
    match the vti1 tunnel configuration.

    Revert "bridge: only expire the mdb entry when query is received"
    
    [ Upstream commit 454594f3b93a49ef568cd190c5af31376b105a7b ]
    
    While this commit was a good attempt to fix issues occuring when no
    multicast querier is present, this commit still has two more issues:
    
    1) There are cases where mdb entries do not expire even if there is a
    querier present. The bridge will unnecessarily continue flooding
    multicast packets on the according ports.
    
    2) Never removing an mdb entry could be exploited for a Denial of
    Service by an attacker on the local link, slowly, but steadily eating up
    all memory.
    
    Actually, this commit became obsolete with
    "bridge: disable snooping if there is no querier" (b00589af3b)
    which included fixes for a few more cases.
    
    Therefore reverting the following commits (the commit stated in the
    commit message plus three of its follow up fixes):
    
    ====================
    Revert "bridge: update mdb expiration timer upon reports."
    This reverts commit f144febd93d5ee534fdf23505ab091b2b9088edc.
    Revert "bridge: do not call setup_timer() multiple times"
    This reverts commit 1faabf2aab1fdaa1ace4e8c829d1b9cf7bfec2f1.
    Revert "bridge: fix some kernel warning in multicast timer"
    This reverts commit c7e8e8a8f7a70b343ca1e0f90a31e35ab2d16de1.
    Revert "bridge: only expire the mdb entry when query is received"
    This reverts commit 9f00b2e7cf241fa389733d41b615efdaa2cb0f5b.

    bridge: update mdb expiration timer upon reports.
    
    [ Upstream commit f144febd93d5ee534fdf23505ab091b2b9088edc ]
    
    commit 9f00b2e7cf241fa389733d41b615efdaa2cb0f5b
            bridge: only expire the mdb entry when query is received
    changed the mdb expiration timer to be armed only when QUERY is
    received.  Howerver, this causes issues in an environment where
    the multicast server socket comes and goes very fast while a client
    is trying to send traffic to it.
    
    The root cause is a race where a sequence of LEAVE followed by REPORT
    messages can race against QUERY messages generated in response to LEAVE.
    The QUERY ends up starting the expiration timer, and that timer can
    potentially expire after the new REPORT message has been received signaling
    the new join operation.  This leads to a significant drop in multicast
    traffic and possible complete stall.
    
    The solution is to have REPORT messages update the expiration timer
    on entries that already exist.

    net/mlx4_en: Fix pages never dma unmapped on rx
    
    [ Upstream commit 021f1107ffdae7a82af6c53f4c52654062e365c6 ]
    
    This patch fixes a bug introduced by commit 51151a16 (mlx4: allow
    order-0 memory allocations in RX path).
    
    dma_unmap_page never reached because condition to detect last fragment
    in page is wrong. offset+frag_stride can't be greater than size, need to
    make sure no additional frag will fit in page => compare offset +
    frag_stride + next_frag_size instead.
    next_frag_size is the same as the current one, since page is shared only
    with frags of the same size.

    xen-netback: Don't destroy the netdev until the vif is shut down
    
    [ upstream commit id: 279f438e36c0a70b23b86d2090aeec50155034a9 ]
    
    Without this patch, if a frontend cycles through states Closing
    and Closed (which Windows frontends need to do) then the netdev
    will be destroyed and requires re-invocation of hotplug scripts
    to restore state before the frontend can move to Connected. Thus
    when udev is not in use the backend gets stuck in InitWait.
    
    With this patch, the netdev is left alone whilst the backend is
    still online and is only de-registered and freed just prior to
    destroying the vif (which is also nicely symmetrical with the
    netdev allocation and registration being done during probe) so
    no re-invocation of hotplug scripts is required.

    ipv4: fix ineffective source address selection

    When sending out multicast messages, the source address in inet->mc_addr is
    ignored and rewritten by an autoselected one. This is caused by a typo in

    sit: amend "allow to use rtnl ops on fb tunnel"
    
    Amend backport to 3.11.y of
    
     [ Upstream commit 205983c43700ac3a81e7625273a3fa83cd2759b5 ]
    
    The discussion thread in the upstream commit mentions that in
    backports to stable-* branches, the line
    
      - unregister_netdevice_queue(sitn->fb_tunnel_dev, &list);
    
    must be omitted if that branch does not have commit 5e6700b3bf98
    ("sit: add support of x-netns"). This line has correctly been omitted
    in the backport to 3.10, which indeed does not have that commit.
    
    It was also removed in the backport to 3.11.y, which does have that
    commit.
    
    This causes the following steps to hit a BUG at net/core/dev.c:5039:
    
      `modprobe sit; rmmod sit`
    
    The bug demonstrates that it causes a device to be unregistered twice.
    The simple fix is to apply the one line in the upstream commit that
    was dropped in the backport to 3.11 (3783100374653e2e7fbdf68c710f5).
    This brings the logic in line with upstream linux, net and net-next
    branches.

    [ Upstream commit f564412c935111c583b787bcc18157377b208e2e ]
    
    The periodic statistics timer gets started at port _probe() time, but
    is stopped on _stop() only. In a modular environment, this can cause
    the timer to access already deallocated memory, if the module is unloaded
    without starting the eth device. To fix this, we add the timer right
    before the port is started, instead of at _probe() time.

    batman-adv: set up network coding packet handlers during module init
    
    [ Upstream commit 6c519bad7b19a2c14a075b400edabaa630330123 ]
    
    batman-adv saves its table of packet handlers as a global state, so handlers
    must be set up only once (and setting them up a second time will fail).
    
    The recently-added network coding support tries to set up its handler each time
    a new softif is registered, which obviously fails when more that one softif is
    used (and in consequence, the softif creation fails).
    
    Fix this by splitting up batadv_nc_init into batadv_nc_init (which is called
    only once) and batadv_nc_mesh_init (which is called for each softif); in
    addition batadv_nc_free is renamed to batadv_nc_mesh_free to keep naming
    consistent.

    tcp: fix incorrect ca_state in tail loss probe
    
    [ Upstream commit 031afe4990a7c9dbff41a3a742c44d3e740ea0a1 ]
    
    On receiving an ACK that covers the loss probe sequence, TLP
    immediately sets the congestion state to Open, even though some packets
    are not recovered and retransmisssion are on the way.  The later ACks
    may trigger a WARN_ON check in step D of tcp_fastretrans_alert(), e.g.,
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=989251
    
    The fix is to follow the similar procedure in recovery by calling
    tcp_try_keep_open(). The sender switches to Open state if no packets
    are retransmissted. Otherwise it goes to Disorder and let subsequent
    ACKs move the state to Recovery or Open.

    tcp: do not forget FIN in tcp_shifted_skb()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5e8a402f831dbe7ee831340a91439e46f0d38acd ]
    
    Yuchung found following problem :
    
     There are bugs in the SACK processing code, merging part in
     tcp_shift_skb_data(), that incorrectly resets or ignores the sacked
     skbs FIN flag. When a receiver first SACK the FIN sequence, and later
     throw away ofo queue (e.g., sack-reneging), the sender will stop
     retransmitting the FIN flag, and hangs forever.
    
    Following packetdrill test can be used to reproduce the bug.

    tcp: must unclone packets before mangling them
    
    [ Upstream commit c52e2421f7368fd36cbe330d2cf41b10452e39a9 ]
    
    TCP stack should make sure it owns skbs before mangling them.
    
    We had various crashes using bnx2x, and it turned out gso_size
    was cleared right before bnx2x driver was populating TC descriptor
    of the _previous_ packet send. TCP stack can sometime retransmit
    packets that are still in Qdisc.
    
    Of course we could make bnx2x driver more robust (using
    ACCESS_ONCE(shinfo->gso_size) for example), but the bug is TCP stack.
    
    We have identified two points where skb_unclone() was needed.
    
    This patch adds a WARN_ON_ONCE() to warn us if we missed another
    fix of this kind.
    
    Kudos to Neal for finding the root cause of this bug. Its visible
    using small MSS.

    tcp: TSQ can use a dynamic limit
    
    [ Upstream commit c9eeec26e32e087359160406f96e0949b3cc6f10 ]
    
    When TCP Small Queues was added, we used a sysctl to limit amount of
    packets queues on Qdisc/device queues for a given TCP flow.
    
    Problem is this limit is either too big for low rates, or too small
    for high rates.
    
    Now TCP stack has rate estimation in sk->sk_pacing_rate, and TSO
    auto sizing, it can better control number of packets in Qdisc/device
    queues.
    
    New limit is two packets or at least 1 to 2 ms worth of packets.
    
    Low rates flows benefit from this patch by having even smaller
    number of packets in queues, allowing for faster recovery,
    better RTT estimations.
    
    High rates flows benefit from this patch by allowing more than 2 packets
    in flight as we had reports this was a limiting factor to reach line
    rate. [ In particular if TX completion is delayed because of coalescing
    parameters ]
    
    Example for a single flow on 10Gbp link controlled by FQ/pacing
    
    14 packets in flight instead of 2
    
    $ tc -s -d qd
    qdisc fq 8001: dev eth0 root refcnt 32 limit 10000p flow_limit 100p
    buckets 1024 quantum 3028 initial_quantum 15140
     Sent 1168459366606 bytes 771822841 pkt (dropped 0, overlimits 0
    requeues 6822476)
     rate 9346Mbit 771713pps backlog 953820b 14p requeues 6822476
      2047 flow, 2046 inactive, 1 throttled, delay 15673 ns
      2372 gc, 0 highprio, 0 retrans, 9739249 throttled, 0 flows_plimit
    
    Note that sk_pacing_rate is currently set to twice the actual rate, but
    this might be refined in the future when a flow is in congestion
    avoidance.
    
    Additional change : skb->destructor should be set to tcp_wfree().
    
    A future patch (for linux 3.13+) might remove tcp_limit_output_bytes

    tcp: TSO packets automatic sizing
    
    [ Upstream commits 6d36824e730f247b602c90e8715a792003e3c5a7,
      02cf4ebd82ff0ac7254b88e466820a290ed8289a, and parts of
      7eec4174ff29cd42f2acfae8112f51c228545d40 ]
    
    After hearing many people over past years complaining against TSO being
    bursty or even buggy, we are proud to present automatic sizing of TSO
    packets.
    
    One part of the problem is that tcp_tso_should_defer() uses an heuristic
    relying on upcoming ACKS instead of a timer, but more generally, having
    big TSO packets makes little sense for low rates, as it tends to create
    micro bursts on the network, and general consensus is to reduce the
    buffering amount.
    
    This patch introduces a per socket sk_pacing_rate, that approximates
    the current sending rate, and allows us to size the TSO packets so
    that we try to send one packet every ms.
    
    This field could be set by other transports.
    
    Patch has no impact for high speed flows, where having large TSO packets
    makes sense to reach line rate.
    
    For other flows, this helps better packet scheduling and ACK clocking.
    
    This patch increases performance of TCP flows in lossy environments.
    
    A new sysctl (tcp_min_tso_segs) is added, to specify the
    minimal size of a TSO packet (default being 2).
    
    A follow-up patch will provide a new packet scheduler (FQ), using
    sk_pacing_rate as an input to perform optional per flow pacing.
    
    This explains why we chose to set sk_pacing_rate to twice the current
    rate, allowing 'slow start' ramp up.
    
    sk_pacing_rate = 2 * cwnd * mss / srtt
    
    v2: Neal Cardwell reported a suspect deferring of last two segments on
    initial write of 10 MSS, I had to change tcp_tso_should_defer() to take
    into account tp->xmit_size_goal_segs
