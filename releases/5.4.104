    The reason is than funciton arm64_is_fake_mcount can not work correctly.
    A symbol of _mcount in *.o compiled with big endian compiler likes:
    00 00 00 2d 00 00 01 1b
    w(rp->r_info) will return 0x2d instead of 0x011b. Because w() takes

    ALSA: hda: intel-nhlt: verify config type
    
    [ Upstream commit a864e8f159b13babf552aff14a5fbe11abc017e4 ]
    
    Multiple bug reports report issues with the SOF and SST drivers when
    dealing with single microphone cases.
    
    We currently read the DMIC array information unconditionally but we
    don't check that the configuration type is actually a mic array.
    
    When the DMIC link does not rely on a mic array configuration, the
    recommendation is to check the format information to infer the maximum
    number of channels, and map this to the number of microphones.
    
    This leaves a potential for a mismatch between actual microphones
    available in hardware and what the ACPI table contains, but we have no
    other source of information.
    
    Note that single microphone configurations can alternatively be
    handled with a 'mic array' configuration along with a 'vendor-defined'
    geometry.

    ALSA: ctxfi: cthw20k2: fix mask on conf to allow 4 bits
    
    [ Upstream commit 26a9630c72ebac7c564db305a6aee54a8edde70e ]
    
    Currently the mask operation on variable conf is just 3 bits so
    the switch statement case value of 8 is unreachable dead code.
    The function daio_mgr_dao_init can be passed a 4 bit value,
    function dao_rsc_init calls it with conf set to:
    
         conf = (desc->msr & 0x7) | (desc->passthru << 3);
    
    so clearly when desc->passthru is set to 1 then conf can be
    at least 8.
    
    Fix this by changing the mask to 0xf.

    crypto - shash: reduce minimum alignment of shash_desc structure
    
    commit 660d2062190db131d2feaf19914e90f868fe285c upstream.
    
    Unlike many other structure types defined in the crypto API, the
    'shash_desc' structure is permitted to live on the stack, which
    implies its contents may not be accessed by DMA masters. (This is
    due to the fact that the stack may be located in the vmalloc area,
    which requires a different virtual-to-physical translation than the
    one implemented by the DMA subsystem)
    
    Our definition of CRYPTO_MINALIGN_ATTR is based on ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN,
    which may take DMA constraints into account on architectures that support
    non-cache coherent DMA such as ARM and arm64. In this case, the value is
    chosen to reflect the largest cacheline size in the system, in order to
    ensure that explicit cache maintenance as required by non-coherent DMA
    masters does not affect adjacent, unrelated slab allocations. On arm64,
    this value is currently set at 128 bytes.
    
    This means that applying CRYPTO_MINALIGN_ATTR to struct shash_desc is both
    unnecessary (as it is never used for DMA), and undesirable, given that it
    wastes stack space (on arm64, performing the alignment costs 112 bytes in
    the worst case, and the hole between the 'tfm' and '__ctx' members takes
    up another 120 bytes, resulting in an increased stack footprint of up to
    232 bytes.) So instead, let's switch to the minimum SLAB alignment, which
    does not take DMA constraints into account.
    
    Note that this is a no-op for x86.

    arm64: ptrace: Fix seccomp of traced syscall -1 (NO_SYSCALL)
    
    commit df84fe94708985cdfb78a83148322bcd0a699472 upstream.
    
    Since commit f086f67485c5 ("arm64: ptrace: add support for syscall
    emulation"), if system call number -1 is called and the process is being
    traced with PTRACE_SYSCALL, for example by strace, the seccomp check is
    skipped and -ENOSYS is returned unconditionally (unless altered by the
    tracer) rather than carrying out action specified in the seccomp filter.
    
    The consequence of this is that it is not possible to reliably strace
    a seccomp based implementation of a foreign system call interface in
    which r7/x8 is permitted to be -1 on entry to a system call.
    
    Also trace_sys_enter and audit_syscall_entry are skipped if a system
    call is skipped.
    
    Fix by removing the in_syscall(regs) check restoring the previous
    behaviour which is like AArch32, x86 (which uses generic code) and
    everything else.

    dm verity: fix FEC for RS roots unaligned to block size
    
    commit df7b59ba9245c4a3115ebaa905e3e5719a3810da upstream.
    
    Optional Forward Error Correction (FEC) code in dm-verity uses
    Reed-Solomon code and should support roots from 2 to 24.
    
    The error correction parity bytes (of roots lengths per RS block) are
    stored on a separate device in sequence without any padding.
    
    Currently, to access FEC device, the dm-verity-fec code uses dm-bufio
    client with block size set to verity data block (usually 4096 or 512
    bytes).
    
    Because this block size is not divisible by some (most!) of the roots
    supported lengths, data repair cannot work for partially stored parity
    bytes.
    
    This fix changes FEC device dm-bufio block size to "roots << SECTOR_SHIFT"
    where we can be sure that the full parity data is always available.
    (There cannot be partial FEC blocks because parity must cover whole
    sectors.)
    
    Because the optional FEC starting offset could be unaligned to this
    new block size, we have to use dm_bufio_set_sector_offset() to
    configure it.
    
    The problem is easily reproduced using veritysetup, e.g. for roots=13:
    
      # create verity device with RS FEC
      dd if=/dev/urandom of=data.img bs=4096 count=8 status=none
      veritysetup format data.img hash.img --fec-device=fec.img --fec-roots=13 | awk '/^Root hash/{ print $3 }' >roothash
    
      # create an erasure that should be always repairable with this roots setting
      dd if=/dev/zero of=data.img conv=notrunc bs=1 count=8 seek=4088 status=none
    
      # try to read it through dm-verity
      veritysetup open data.img test hash.img --fec-device=fec.img --fec-roots=13 $(cat roothash)
      dd if=/dev/mapper/test of=/dev/null bs=4096 status=noxfer
      # wait for possible recursive recovery in kernel
      udevadm settle
      veritysetup close test
    
    With this fix, errors are properly repaired.
      device-mapper: verity-fec: 7:1: FEC 0: corrected 8 errors
      ...
    
    Without it, FEC code usually ends on unrecoverable failure in RS decoder:
      device-mapper: verity-fec: 7:1: FEC 0: failed to correct: -74
      ...
    
    This problem is present in all kernels since the FEC code's
    introduction (kernel 4.5).
    
    It is thought that this problem is not visible in Android ecosystem
    because it always uses a default RS roots=2.

    dm bufio: subtract the number of initial sectors in dm_bufio_get_device_size
    
    commit a14e5ec66a7a66e57b24e2469f9212a78460207e upstream.
    
    dm_bufio_get_device_size returns the device size in blocks. Before
    returning the value, we must subtract the nubmer of starting
    sectors. The number of starting sectors may not be divisible by block
    size.
    
    Note that currently, no target is using dm_bufio_set_sector_offset and
    dm_bufio_get_device_size simultaneously, so this change has no effect.
    However, an upcoming dm-verity-fec fix needs this change.

    PM: runtime: Update device status before letting suppliers suspend
    
    commit 44cc89f764646b2f1f2ea5d1a08b230131707851 upstream.
    
    Because the PM-runtime status of the device is not updated in
    __rpm_callback(), attempts to suspend the suppliers of the given
    device triggered by rpm_put_suppliers() called by it may fail.
    
    Fix this by making __rpm_callback() update the device's status to
    RPM_SUSPENDED before calling rpm_put_suppliers() if the current
    status of the device is RPM_SUSPENDING and the callback just invoked
    by it has returned 0 (success).
    
    While at it, modify the code in __rpm_callback() to always check
    the device's PM-runtime status under its PM lock.

    btrfs: fix warning when creating a directory with smack enabled
    
    commit fd57a98d6f0c98fa295813087f13afb26c224e73 upstream.
    
    When we have smack enabled, during the creation of a directory smack may
    attempt to add a "smack transmute" xattr on the inode, which results in
    the following warning and trace:

    This happens because at btrfs_mkdir() we call d_instantiate_new() while
    holding a transaction handle, which results in the following call chain:
    
      btrfs_mkdir()
         trans = btrfs_start_transaction(root, 5);
    
         d_instantiate_new()
            smack_d_instantiate()
                __vfs_setxattr()
                    btrfs_setxattr_trans()
                       btrfs_start_transaction()
                          start_transaction()
                             WARN_ON()
                               --> a tansaction start has TRANS_EXTWRITERS
                                   set in its type
                             h->orig_rsv = h->block_rsv
                             h->block_rsv = NULL
    
         btrfs_end_transaction(trans)
    
    Besides the warning triggered at start_transaction, we set the handle's
    block_rsv to NULL which may cause some surprises later on.
    
    So fix this by making btrfs_setxattr_trans() not start a transaction when
    we already have a handle on one, stored in current->journal_info, and use
    that handle. We are good to use the handle because at btrfs_mkdir() we did
    reserve space for the xattr and the inode item.

    btrfs: unlock extents in btrfs_zero_range in case of quota reservation errors
    
    commit 4f6a49de64fd1b1dba5229c02047376da7cf24fd upstream.
    
    If btrfs_qgroup_reserve_data returns an error (i.e quota limit reached)
    the handling logic directly goes to the 'out' label without first
    unlocking the extent range between lockstart, lockend. This results in
    deadlocks as other processes try to lock the same extent.

    btrfs: free correct amount of space in btrfs_delayed_inode_reserve_metadata
    
    commit 0f9c03d824f6f522d3bc43629635c9765546ebc5 upstream.
    
    Following commit f218ea6c4792 ("btrfs: delayed-inode: Remove wrong
    qgroup meta reservation calls") this function now reserves num_bytes,
    rather than the fixed amount of nodesize. As such this requires the
    same amount to be freed in case of failure. Fix this by adjusting
    the amount we are freeing.

    btrfs: validate qgroup inherit for SNAP_CREATE_V2 ioctl
    
    commit 5011c5a663b9c6d6aff3d394f11049b371199627 upstream.
    
    The problem is we're copying "inherit" from user space but we don't
    necessarily know that we're copying enough data for a 64 byte
    struct.  Then the next problem is that 'inherit' has a variable size
    array at the end, and we have to verify that array is the size we
    expected.

    btrfs: fix raid6 qstripe kmap
    
    commit d70cef0d46729808dc53f145372c02b145c92604 upstream.
    
    When a qstripe is required an extra page is allocated and mapped.  There
    were 3 problems:
    
    1) There is no corresponding call of kunmap() for the qstripe page.
    2) There is no reason to map the qstripe page more than once if the
       number of bits set in rbio->dbitmap is greater than one.
    3) There is no reason to map the parity page and unmap it each time
       through the loop.
    
    The page memory can continue to be reused with a single mapping on each
    iteration by raid6_call.gen_syndrome() without remapping.  So map the
    page for the duration of the loop.
    
    Similarly, improve the algorithm by mapping the parity page just 1 time.

    btrfs: raid56: simplify tracking of Q stripe presence
    
    commit c17af96554a8a8777cbb0fd53b8497250e548b43 upstream.
    
    There are temporary variables tracking the index of P and Q stripes, but
    none of them is really used as such, merely for determining if the Q
    stripe is present. This leads to compiler warnings with
    -Wunused-but-set-variable and has been reported several times.
    
    fs/btrfs/raid56.c: In function ‘finish_rmw’:
    fs/btrfs/raid56.c:1199:6: warning: variable ‘p_stripe’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
     1199 |  int p_stripe = -1;

     2356 |  int p_stripe = -1;
          |      ^~~~~~~~
    
    Replace the two variables with one that has a clear meaning and also get
    rid of the warnings. The logic that verifies that there are only 2
    valid cases is unchanged.
