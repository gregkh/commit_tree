    kernel-doc: bugfix - multi-line macros
    
    commit 654784284430bf2739985914b65e09c7c35a7273 upstream.
    
    Prior to this patch the following code breaks:
    
    /**
     * multiline_example - this breaks kernel-doc
     */
     #define multiline_example( \
    myparam)
    
    Producing this error:
    
    Error(somefile.h:983): cannot understand prototype: 'multiline_example( \ '
    
    This patch fixes the issue by appending all lines ending in a blackslash
    (optionally followed by whitespace), removing the backslash and any
    whitespace after it prior to appending (just like the C pre-processor
    would).
    
    This fixes a break in kerel-doc introduced by the additions to rbtree.h.

    sfc: Fix efx_rx_buf_offset() for recycled pages
    
    This bug fix is only for stable branches older than 3.10.  The bug was
    fixed upstream by commit 2768935a4660 ('sfc: reuse pages to avoid DMA
    mapping/unmapping costs'), but that change is totally unsuitable for
    stable.
    
    Commit b590ace09d51 ('sfc: Fix efx_rx_buf_offset() in the presence of
    swiotlb') added an explicit page_offset member to struct
    efx_rx_buffer, which must be set consistently with the u.page and
    dma_addr fields.  However, it failed to add the necessary assignment
    in efx_resurrect_rx_buffer().  It also did not correct the calculation
    of efx_rx_buffer::dma_addr in efx_resurrect_rx_buffer(), which assumes
    that DMA-mapping a page will result in a page-aligned DMA address
    (exactly what swiotlb violates).
    
    Add the assignment of efx_rx_buffer::page_offset and change the
    calculation of dma_addr to make use of it.

    fanotify: dont merge permission events
    
    commit 03a1cec1f17ac1a6041996b3e40f96b5a2f90e1b upstream.
    
    Boyd Yang reported a problem for the case that multiple threads of the same
    thread group are waiting for a reponse for a permission event.
    In this case it is possible that some of the threads are never woken up, even
    if the response for the event has been received
    (see http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=131822913806350&w=2).
    
    The reason is that we are currently merging permission events if they belong to
    the same thread group. But we are not prepared to wake up more than one waiter
    for each event. We do
    
    wait_event(group->fanotify_data.access_waitq, event->response ||
                            atomic_read(&group->fanotify_data.bypass_perm));
    and after that
      event->response = 0;
    
    which is the reason that even if we woke up all waiters for the same event
    some of them may see event->response being already set 0 again, then go back to
    sleep and block forever.
    
    With this patch we avoid that more than one thread is waiting for a response
    by not merging permission events for the same thread group any more.

    commit 95cf59ea72331d0093010543b8951bb43f262cac upstream.
    
    Jiri reported that he could trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE() in
    perf_cgroup_switch() using sw-events. This is because sw-events share
    a cpuctx with multiple PMUs.
    
    Use the ->unique_pmu pointer to limit the pmu iteration to unique

    perf: Clarify perf_cpu_context::active_pmu usage by renaming it to ::unique_pmu
    
    commit 3f1f33206c16c7b3839d71372bc2ac3f305aa802 upstream.
    
    Stephane thought the perf_cpu_context::active_pmu name confusing and
    suggested using 'unique_pmu' instead.
    
    This pointer is a pointer to a 'random' pmu sharing the cpuctx
    instance, therefore limiting a for_each_pmu loop to those where
    cpuctx->unique_pmu matches the pmu we get a loop over unique cpuctx
    instances.

    drm/radeon/atom: workaround vbios bug in transmitter table on rs880 (v2)
    
    commit 91f3a6aaf280294b07c05dfe606e6c27b7ba3c72 upstream.
    
    The OUTPUT_ENABLE action jumps past the point in the coder where
    the data_offset is set on certain rs780 cards.  This worked
    previously because the OUTPUT_ENABLE action is always called
    immediately after the ENABLE action so the data_offset remained
    set.  In 6f8bbaf568c7f2c497558bfd04654c0b9841ad57
    (drm/radeon/atom: initialize more atom interpretor elements to 0),
    we explictly reset data_offset to 0 between atom calls which then
    caused this to fail.  The fix is to just skip calling the
    OUTPUT_ENABLE action on the problematic chipsets.  The ENABLE
    action does the same thing and more.  Ultimately, we could
    probably drop the OUTPUT_ENABLE action all together on DCE3
    asics.

    The table has the following format:
    
    typedef struct _ATOM_SRC_DST_TABLE_FOR_ONE_OBJECT         //usSrcDstTableOffset pointing to this structure
    {

      USHORT              usDstObjectID[1];
    }ATOM_SRC_DST_TABLE_FOR_ONE_OBJECT;
    
    usSrcObjectID[] and usDstObjectID[] are variably sized, so we
    can't access them directly.  Use pointers and update the offset
    appropriately when accessing the Dst members.

    drm/ttm: fix the tt_populated check in ttm_tt_destroy()
    
    commit 182b17c8dc4e83aab000ce86587b6810e515da87 upstream.
    
    After a vmalloc failure in ttm_dma_tt_alloc_page_directory(),
    ttm_dma_tt_init() will call ttm_tt_destroy() to cleanup, and end up
    inside the driver's unpopulate() hook when populate() has never yet
    been called.
    
    On nouveau, the first issue to be hit because of this is that
    dma_address[] may be a NULL pointer.  After working around this,
    ttm_pool_unpopulate() may potentially hit the same issue with
    the pages[] array.
    
    It seems to make more sense to avoid calling unpopulate on already
    unpopulated TTMs than to add checks to all the implementations.

    In the worst case, this bug can lead to "use-after-free" and cause a panic,
    because it's new cgroup's refcount that is incremented at (*1),
    so the old cgroup(and related data) can be freed before (*2).
    
    In fact, a panic caused by this bug was originally caught in RHEL6.4.

    rt2800: fix wrong TX power compensation
    
    commit 6e956da2027c767859128b9bfef085cf2a8e233b upstream.
    
    We should not do temperature compensation on devices without
    EXTERNAL_TX_ALC bit set (called DynamicTxAgcControl on vendor driver).
    Such devices can have totally bogus TSSI parameters on the EEPROM,
    but still threaded by us as valid and result doing wrong TX power
    calculations.
    
    This fix inability to connect to AP on slightly longer distance on
    some Ralink chips/devices.

    Revert "sctp: fix call to SCTP_CMD_PROCESS_SACK in sctp_cmd_interpreter()"
    
    This reverts commit c2f5b7507ac5d808f29287d77ee6148358d7fbfe which is
    commit f6e80abeab928b7c47cc1fbf53df13b4398a2bec.
    
    Michal writes:
            Mainline commit f6e80abe was introduced in v3.7-rc2 as a
            follow-up fix to commit
    
              edfee033  sctp: check src addr when processing SACK to update transport state
    
            (from v3.7-rc1) which changed the interpretation of third
            argument to sctp_cmd_process_sack() and sctp_outq_sack(). But as
            commit edfee033 has never been backported to stable branches,
            backport of commit f6e80abe actually breaks the code rather than
            fixing it.
