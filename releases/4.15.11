    dmaengine: qcom_hidma: check pending interrupts
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 38680bc6b1e3592bc9e18adc1d6e259667df27ce ]
    
    Driver is missing the interrupts if two requests are queued up at the same
    time as the interrupt handler is servicing a request that was just
    delivered.
    
    The ISR clears the interrupt at the end but it could be clearing the
    interrupt for an outstanding event. Therefore, second interrupt never
    arrives.
    
    Clear the interrupt first and then check for completions.
    
    Also, make sure that request start and interrupt clear do not overlap in
    time by using a spinlock.

    IB/mlx5: revisit -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1b19b95169cd52fe82cd442fec0b279fe25cc838 ]
    
    A warning that I thought I had fixed before occasionally comes
    back in rare randconfig builds (I found 7 instances in the last
    100000 builds, originally it was much more frequent):
    
    drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/mr.c: In function 'mlx5_ib_reg_user_mr':
    drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/mr.c:1229:5: error: 'order' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
      if (order <= mr_cache_max_order(dev)) {
         ^
    drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/mr.c:1247:8: error: 'ncont' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/mr.c:1247:8: error: 'page_shift' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/mr.c:1260:2: error: 'npages' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    
    I've looked at all those findings again and noticed that they are all
    with CONFIG_INFINIBAND_USER_MEM=n, which means ib_umem_get() returns
    an error unconditionally and we never initialize or use those variables.
    This triggers a condition in gcc iff mr_umem_get() is partially but not
    entirely inlined, which in turn depends on the exact combination of
    optimization settings. This is a known problem with gcc, with no
    easy solution in the compiler, so this adds another workaround that
    should be more reliable than my previous attempt.
    
    Returning an error from mlx5_ib_reg_user_mr() earlier means that we
    can completely bypass the logic that caused the warning, the compiler
    can now see that the variable is never accessed.

    ima: relax requiring a file signature for new files with zero length
    
    
    [ Upstream commit b7e27bc1d42e8e0cc58b602b529c25cd0071b336 ]
    
    Custom policies can require file signatures based on LSM labels.  These
    files are normally created and only afterwards labeled, requiring them
    to be signed.
    
    Instead of requiring file signatures based on LSM labels, entire
    filesystems could require file signatures.  In this case, we need the
    ability of writing new files without requiring file signatures.
    
    The definition of a "new" file was originally defined as any file with
    a length of zero.  Subsequent patches redefined a "new" file to be based
    on the FILE_CREATE open flag.  By combining the open flag with a file
    size of zero, this patch relaxes the file signature requirement.

    [ Upstream commit 2adfa4210f8f35cdfb4e08318cc06b99752964c2 ]
    
    The 'configinit.sh' script checks the format of optional argument for the

    However, the error message uses the wrong variable, indicating an empty

    ipvlan: add L2 check for packets arriving via virtual devices
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 92ff42645028fa6f9b8aa767718457b9264316b4 ]
    
    Packets that don't have dest mac as the mac of the master device should
    not be entertained by the IPvlan rx-handler. This is mostly true as the
    packet path mostly takes care of that, except when the master device is
    a virtual device. As demonstrated in the following case -
    
      ip netns add ns1
      ip link add ve1 type veth peer name ve2
      ip link add link ve2 name iv1 type ipvlan mode l2
      ip link set dev iv1 netns ns1
      ip link set ve1 up
      ip link set ve2 up
      ip -n ns1 link set iv1 up
      ip addr add 192.168.10.1/24 dev ve1
      ip -n ns1 addr 192.168.10.2/24 dev iv1
      ping -c2 192.168.10.2
      <Works!>
      ip neigh show dev ve1
      ip neigh show 192.168.10.2 lladdr <random> dev ve1
      ping -c2 192.168.10.2
      <Still works! Wrong!!>
    
    This patch adds that missing check in the IPvlan rx-handler.

    Enforce using PS_MANUAL_POLL in ps hwsim debugfs to trigger a poll,
    only if PS_ENABLED was set before.
    This is required due to commit c9491367b759 ("mac80211: always update the

    check only mgmt/data frames ps bit, and then update station's power save
    accordingly.
    When sending only ps-poll (control frame) the ap will not be aware that
    the station entered power save.
    Setting ps enable before triggering ps_poll, will send NDP with PM bit
    enabled first.

    agp/intel: Flush all chipset writes after updating the GGTT
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 8516673a996870ea0ceb337ee4f83c33c5ec3111 ]
    
    Before accessing the GGTT we must flush the PTE writes and make them
    visible to the chipset, or else the indirect access may end up in the
    wrong page. In commit 3497971a71d8 ("agp/intel: Flush chipset writes
    after updating a single PTE"), we noticed corruption of the uploads for
    pwrite and for capturing GPU error states, but it was presumed that the
    explicit calls to intel_gtt_chipset_flush() were sufficient for the
    execbuffer path. However, we have not been flushing the chipset between
    the PTE writes and access via the GTT itself.
    
    For simplicity, do the flush after any PTE update rather than try and
    batch the flushes on a just-in-time basis.

    [ Upstream commit f5bbcd533a9d1af97b8a0862a421bb8455f1bf6d ]
    
    Describe the GPIO used to reset the Ethernet PHY for EthernetAVB.
    This allows the driver to reset the PHY during probe and after system
    resume.
    
    This fixes Ethernet operation after resume from s2ram on Salvator-XS,
    where the enable pin of the regulator providing PHY power is connected
    to PRESETn, and PSCI powers down the SoC during system suspend.
    
    On Salvator-X, the enable pin is always pulled high, but the driver may
    still need to reset the PHY if this wasn't done by the bootloader
    before.
    
    Inspired by patches in the BSP for the individual Salvator-X/XS boards
    by Kazuya Mizuguchi.

    happen for non-maskable interrupts or synchronous interrupts), it goes
    through the motions of soft-disabling again, including calling
    TRACE_DISABLE_INTS (i.e., trace_hardirqs_off()).
    
    This is not necessary, because we must already be soft-disabled in the
    interrupt context, it also may be causing crashes in the irq tracing
    code to re-enter as an nmi. Replace it with a warning to ensure that
    soft-interrupts are still disabled.

    powerpc/modules: Don't try to restore r2 after a sibling call
    
    
    [ Upstream commit b9eab08d012fa093947b230f9a87257c27fb829b ]
    
    When attempting to load a livepatch module, I got the following error:
    
      module_64: patch_module: Expect noop after relocate, got 3c820000
    
    The error was triggered by the following code in
    unregister_netdevice_queue():
    
      14c:   00 00 00 48     b       14c <unregister_netdevice_queue+0x14c>

    GCC didn't insert a nop after the branch to net_set_todo() because it's
    a sibling call, so it never returns.  The nop isn't needed after the
    branch in that case.

    net: sched: drop qdisc_reset from dev_graft_qdisc
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7bbde83b1860c28a1cc35516352c4e7e5172c29a ]
    
    In qdisc_graft_qdisc a "new" qdisc is attached and the 'qdisc_destroy'
    operation is called on the old qdisc. The destroy operation will wait
    a rcu grace period and call qdisc_rcu_free(). At which point
    gso_cpu_skb is free'd along with all stats so no need to zero stats
    and gso_cpu_skb from the graft operation itself.
    
    Further after dropping the qdisc locks we can not continue to call
    qdisc_reset before waiting an rcu grace period so that the qdisc is
    detached from all cpus. By removing the qdisc_reset() here we get
    the correct property of waiting an rcu grace period and letting the
    qdisc_destroy operation clean up the qdisc correctly.
    
    Note, a refcnt greater than 1 would cause the destroy operation to
    be aborted however if this ever happened the reference to the qdisc
    would be lost and we would have a memory leak.

    virtio_net: Disable interrupts if napi_complete_done rescheduled napi
    
    
    [ Upstream commit fdaa767aefc1685f9a41e91f447c9aea94103df6 ]
    
    Since commit 39e6c8208d7b ("net: solve a NAPI race") napi has been able
    to be rescheduled within napi_complete_done() even in non-busypoll case,
    but virtnet_poll() always enabled interrupts before complete, and when
    napi was rescheduled within napi_complete_done() it did not disable
    interrupts.
    This caused more interrupts when event idx is disabled.
    
    According to commit cbdadbbf0c79 ("virtio_net: fix race in RX VQ
    processing") we cannot place virtqueue_enable_cb_prepare() after
    NAPI_STATE_SCHED is cleared, so disable interrupts again if
    napi_complete_done() returned false.
    
    Tested with vhost-user of OVS 2.7 on host, which does not have the event
    idx feature.

    [ Upstream commit 61e06e2c3ebd986050958513bfa40dceed756f8f ]
    
    The raid set size is being revalidated unconditionally before a
    reshaping conversion is started.  MD requires the size to only be
    reduced in case of a stripe removing (i.e. shrinking) reshape but not
    when growing because the raid array has to stay small until after the
    growing reshape finishes.
    
    Fix by avoiding the size revalidation in preresume unless a shrinking
    reshape is requested.

    When used as part of a display pipeline, the VSP is stopped and
    restarted explicitly by the DU from its suspend and resume handlers.
    There is thus no need to stop or restart pipelines in the VSP suspend
    and resume handlers, and doing so would cause the hardware to be
    left in a misconfigured state.
    
    Ensure that the VSP suspend and resume handlers do not affect DRM-based

    [ Upstream commit a44c9d36509c83cf64f33b93f6ab2e63822c01eb ]
    
    Since scsi_get_device_flags_keyed() callers do not check whether or not
    the returned value is an error code, change that function such that it
    returns a flags value even if the 'key' argument is invalid.  Note:
    since commit 28a0bc4120d3 ("scsi: sd: Implement blacklist option for
    WRITE SAME w/ UNMAP") bit 31 is a valid device information flag so
    checking whether bit 31 is set in the return value is not sufficient to
    tell the difference between an error code and a flags value.

    [ Upstream commit a8168b6cee6e9334dfebb4b9108e8d73794f6088 ]
    
    On some dual port NICs, the 2 ports have to be configured with compatible
    link speeds.  Under some conditions, a port's configured speed may no
    longer be supported.  The firmware will send a message to the driver
    when this happens.
    
    Improve this logic that prints out the warning by only printing it if

    spi: sun6i: disable/unprepare clocks on remove
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d9bbd02c54094ceffa555143b0d68cd06504d63 ]
    
    sun6i_spi_probe() uses sun6i_spi_runtime_resume() to prepare/enable
    clocks, so sun6i_spi_remove() should use sun6i_spi_runtime_suspend() to
    disable/unprepare them if we're not suspended.
    Replacing pm_runtime_disable() by pm_runtime_force_suspend() will ensure
    that sun6i_spi_runtime_suspend() is called if needed.

    tools/usbip: fixes build with musl libc toolchain
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 77be4c878c72e411ad22af96b6f81dd45c26450a ]
    
    Indeed musl doesn't define old SIGCLD signal name but only new one SIGCHLD.
    SIGCHLD is the new POSIX name for that signal so it doesn't change
    anything on other libcs.
    
    This fixes this kind of build error:

    iwlwifi: mvm: avoid dumping assert log when device is stopped
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6362ab721ef5c4ecfa01f53ad4137d3d984f0c6c ]
    
    We might erroneously get to error dumping code when the
    device is already stopped.
    
    In that case the driver will detect a defective value and will try to
    reset the HW, assuming it is only a bus issue.  The driver than
    proceeds with the dumping.
    
    The result has two side effects:
    
    1. The device won't be stopped again, since the transport status is
    already stopped, so the device remains powered on while it actually
    should be stopped.
    
    2. The dump in that case is completely garbaged and useless.
    
    Detect and avoid this.  It will also make debugging such issues
    easier.

    perf annotate: Fix objdump comment parsing for Intel mov dissassembly
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 35a8a148d8c1ee9e5ae18f9565a880490f816f89 ]
    
    The command 'perf annotate' parses the output of objdump and also
    investigates the comments produced by objdump. For example the
    output of objdump produces (on x86):
    
    23eee:  4c 8b 3d 13 01 21 00 mov 0x210113(%rip),%r15
                                    # 234008 <stderr@@GLIBC_2.2.5+0x9a8>
    
    and the function mov__parse() is called to investigate the complete
    line. Mov__parse() breaks this line into several parts and finally
    calls function comment__symbol() to parse the data after the comment
    character '#'. Comment__symbol() expects a hexadecimal address followed
    by a symbol in '<' and '>' brackets.
    
    However the 2nd parameter given to function comment__symbol()
    always points to the comment character '#'. The address parsing
    always returns 0 because the character '#' is not a digit and
    strtoull() fails without being noticed.
    
    Fix this by advancing the second parameter to function comment__symbol()
    by one byte before invocation and add an error check after strtoull()
    has been called.

    perf annotate: Fix unnecessary memory allocation for s390x
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 36c263607d36c6a3788c09301d9f5fe35404048a ]
    
    This patch fixes a bug introduced with commit d9f8dfa9baf9 ("perf
    annotate s390: Implement jump types for perf annotate").
    
    'perf annotate' displays annotated assembler output by reading output of
    command objdump and parsing the disassembled lines. For each shown
    mnemonic this function sequence is executed:
    
      disasm_line__new()
      |
      +--> disasm_line__init_ins()
           |
           +--> ins__find()
                |
                +--> arch->associate_instruction_ops()
    
    The s390x specific function assigned to function pointer
    associate_instruction_ops refers to function s390__associate_ins_ops().
    
    This function checks for supported mnemonics and assigns a NULL pointer
    to unsupported mnemonics.  However even the NULL pointer is added to the
    architecture dependend instruction array.
    
    This leads to an extremely large architecture instruction array
    (due to array resize logic in function arch__grow_instructions()).
    
    Depending on the objdump output being parsed the array can end up
    with several ten-thousand elements.
    
    This patch checks if a mnemonic is supported and only adds supported
    ones into the architecture instruction array. The array does not contain
    elements with NULL pointers anymore.
    
    Before the patch (With some debug printf output):
    
    [root@s35lp76 perf]# time ./perf annotate --stdio > /tmp/xxxbb
    
    real    8m49.679s
    user    7m13.008s
    sys     0m1.649s
    [root@s35lp76 perf]# fgrep '__ins__find sorted:1 nr_instructions:'
                            /tmp/xxxbb | tail -1
    __ins__find sorted:1 nr_instructions:87433 ins:0x341583c0
    [root@s35lp76 perf]#
    
    The number of different s390x branch/jump/call/return instructions
    entered into the array is 87433.
    
    After the patch (With some printf debug output:)
    
    [root@s35lp76 perf]# time ./perf annotate --stdio > /tmp/xxxaa
    
    real    1m24.553s
    user    0m0.587s
    sys     0m1.530s
    [root@s35lp76 perf]# fgrep '__ins__find sorted:1 nr_instructions:'
                            /tmp/xxxaa | tail -1
    __ins__find sorted:1 nr_instructions:56 ins:0x3f406570
    [root@s35lp76 perf]#
    
    The number of different s390x branch/jump/call/return instructions
    entered into the array is 56 which is sensible.

    scsi: lpfc: Fix crash during driver unload with running nvme traffic
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 3386f4bdd243ad5a9094d390297602543abe9902 ]
    
    When the driver is unloading, the nvme transport could be in the process
    of submitting new requests, will send abort requests to terminate
    associations, or may make LS-related requests.  The driver's abort and
    request entry points currently is ignorant of the unloading state and is
    starting the requests even though the infrastructure to complete them
    continues to teardown.
    
    Change the entry points for new requests to check whether unloading and
    if so, reject the requests. Abort routines check unloading, and if so,
    noop the request. An abort is noop'd as the teardown paths are already
    aborting/terminating the io outstanding at the time the teardown
    initiated.

    KVM: X86: Restart the guest when insn_len is zero and SEV is enabled
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 00b10fe1046c4b2232097a7ffaa9238c7e479388 ]
    
    On AMD platforms, under certain conditions insn_len may be zero on #NPF.
    This can happen if a guest gets a page-fault on data access but the HW
    table walker is not able to read the instruction page (e.g instruction
    page is not present in memory).
    
    Typically, when insn_len is zero, x86_emulate_instruction() walks the
    guest page table and fetches the instruction bytes from guest memory.
    When SEV is enabled, the guest memory is encrypted with guest-specific
    key hence hypervisor will not able to fetch the instruction bytes.
    In those cases we simply restart the guest.
    
    I have encountered this issue when running kernbench inside the guest.

    cpufreq: Fix governor module removal race
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a8b149d32b663c1a4105273295184b78f53d33cf ]
    
    It is possible to remove a cpufreq governor module after
    cpufreq_parse_governor() has returned success in
    store_scaling_governor() and before cpufreq_set_policy()
    acquires a reference to it, because the governor list is
    not protected during that period and nothing prevents the
    governor from being unregistered then.
    
    Prevent that from happening by acquiring an extra reference
    to the governor module temporarily in cpufreq_parse_governor(),
    under cpufreq_governor_mutex, and dropping it in
    store_scaling_governor(), when cpufreq_set_policy() returns.
    
    Note that the second cpufreq_parse_governor() call site is fine,
    because it only cares about the policy member of new_policy.

    [ Upstream commit 424ea0d174e82365f85c6770225dba098b8f1d5f ]
    
    It is required to update the teardown state of the peer when
    a tdls link with that peer is terminated. This information is
    useful for the target to perform some cleanups wrt the tdls peer.
    
    Without proper cleanup, target assumes that the peer is connected and
    blocks future connection requests, updating the teardown state of the
    peer addresses the problem.
    
    Tested this change on QCA9888 with 10.4-3.5.1-00018 fw version.

    drm/etnaviv: make THERMAL selectable
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 49b82c389d2a40eaef1355aaa35868b367aec9d1 ]
    
    The etnaviv driver causes a link failure if it is built-in but THERMAL
    is built as a module:
    
      drivers/gpu/drm/etnaviv/etnaviv_gpu.o: In function `etnaviv_gpu_bind':
      etnaviv_gpu.c:(.text+0x4c4): undefined reference to `thermal_of_cooling_device_register'

      etnaviv_gpu.c:(.text+0x2aac): undefined reference to `thermal_cooling_device_unregister'
    
    Adding a Kconfig dependency on THERMAL || !THERMAL to avoid this causes

    To work around this, add a new option DRM_ETNAVIV_THERMAL to optionally
    enable thermal throttling support and make DRM_ETNAVIV select THERMAL
    at the same time.

    If an error occurs when we enable the backup battery charging, we should
    go through the error handling path directly.
    
    Before commit db43e6c473b5 ("ab8500-bm: Add usb power path support") this
    was the case, but this commit has added some code between the last test and
    the 'out' label.
    So, in case of error, this added code is executed and the error may be
    silently ignored.
    
    Fix it by adding the missing 'goto out', as done in all other error
    handling paths.

    userns: Don't fail follow_automount based on s_user_ns
    
    
    [ Upstream commit bbc3e471011417598e598707486f5d8814ec9c01 ]
    
    When vfs_submount was added the test to limit automounts from
    filesystems that with s_user_ns != &init_user_ns accidentially left
    in follow_automount.  The test was never about any security concerns
    and was always about how do we implement this for filesystems whose
    s_user_ns != &init_user_ns.
    
    At the moment this check makes no difference as there are no
    filesystems that both set FS_USERNS_MOUNT and implement d_automount.
    
    Remove this check now while I am thinking about it so there will not
    be odd booby traps for someone who does want to make this combination
    work.
    
    vfs_submount still needs improvements to allow this combination to work,
    and vfs_submount contains a check that presents a warning.
    
    The autofs4 filesystem could be modified to set FS_USERNS_MOUNT and it would
    need not work on this code path, as userspace performs the mounts.

    would leave nothing for XDP_TX. This patch fixes this by doubling

    mtd: nand: fix interpretation of NAND_CMD_NONE in nand_command[_lp]()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit df467899da0b71465760b4e35127bce837244eee ]
    
    Some drivers (like nand_hynix.c) call ->cmdfunc() with NAND_CMD_NONE
    and a column address and expect the controller to only send address
    cycles. Right now, the default ->cmdfunc() implementations provided by
    the core do not filter out the command cycle in this case and forwards
    the request to the controller driver through the ->cmd_ctrl() method.
    The thing is, NAND controller drivers can get this wrong and send a
    command cycle with a NAND_CMD_NONE opcode and since NAND_CMD_NONE is
    -1, and the command field is usually casted to an u8, we end up sending
    the 0xFF command which is actually a RESET operation.
    
    Add conditions in nand_command[_lp]() functions to sending the initial
    command cycle when command == NAND_CMD_NONE.

    net: xfrm: allow clearing socket xfrm policies.
    
    
    [ Upstream commit be8f8284cd897af2482d4e54fbc2bdfc15557259 ]
    
    Currently it is possible to add or update socket policies, but
    not clear them. Therefore, once a socket policy has been applied,
    the socket cannot be used for unencrypted traffic.
    
    This patch allows (privileged) users to clear socket policies by
    passing in a NULL pointer and zero length argument to the
    {IP,IPV6}_{IPSEC,XFRM}_POLICY setsockopts. This results in both
    the incoming and outgoing policies being cleared.
    
    The simple approach taken in this patch cannot clear socket
    policies in only one direction. If desired this could be added
    in the future, for example by continuing to pass in a length of
    zero (which currently is guaranteed to return EMSGSIZE) and
    making the policy be a pointer to an integer that contains one
    of the XFRM_POLICY_{IN,OUT} enum values.
    
    An alternative would have been to interpret the length as a
    signed integer and use XFRM_POLICY_IN (i.e., 0) to clear the
    input policy and -XFRM_POLICY_OUT (i.e., -1) to clear the output
    policy.

    perf report: Fix -D output for user metadata events
    
    
    [ Upstream commit f250b09c779550e4a7a412dae6d3ad34d5201019 ]
    
    The PERF_RECORD_USER_ events are synthesized by the tool to assist in
    processing the PERF_RECORD_ ones generated by the kernel, the printing
    of that information doesn't come with a perf_sample structure, so, when
    dumping the event fields using 'perf report -D' there were columns that
    end up not being printed.
    
    To tidy up a bit this, fake a perf_sample structure with zeroes to have
    the missing columns printed and avoid the occasional surprise with that.

    test_firmware: fix setting old custom fw path back on exit
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 65c79230576873b312c3599479c1e42355c9f349 ]
    
    The file /sys/module/firmware_class/parameters/path can be used
    to set a custom firmware path. The fw_filesystem.sh script creates
    a temporary directory to add a test firmware file to be used during
    testing, in order for this to work it uses the custom path syfs file
    and it was supposed to reset back the file on execution exit. The
    script failed to do this due to a typo, it was using OLD_PATH instead
    of OLD_FWPATH, since its inception since v3.17.
    
    Its not as easy to just keep the old setting, it turns out that
    resetting an empty setting won't actually do what we want, we need
    to check if it was empty and set an empty space.
    
    Without this we end up having the temporary path always set after
    we run these tests.

    This splat cannot be generated by expedited grace periods because they
    always invoke resched_cpu() on the current CPU, which is good because
    expedited grace periods require that resched_cpu() unconditionally
    succeed.  However, other parts of RCU can tolerate resched_cpu() acting
    as a no-op, at least as long as it doesn't happen too often.
    
    This commit therefore makes resched_cpu() invoke resched_curr() only if
    the CPU is either online or is the current CPU.

    [ Upstream commit 2fe2582649aa2355f79acddb86bd4d6c5363eb63 ]
    
    The rcutorture test suite occasionally provokes a splat due to invoking
    rt_mutex_lock() which needs to boost the priority of a task currently
    sitting on a runqueue that belongs to an offline CPU:

    But the target task's priority has already been adjusted, so the only
    purpose of switched_to_rt() invoking resched_curr() is to wake up the
    CPU running some task that needs to be preempted by the boosted task.
    But the CPU is offline, which presumably means that the task must be
    migrated to some other CPU, and that this other CPU will undertake any
    needed preemption at the time of migration.  Because the runqueue lock
    is held when resched_curr() is invoked, we know that the boosted task
    cannot go anywhere, so it is not necessary to invoke resched_curr()
    in this particular case.
    
    This commit therefore makes switched_to_rt() refrain from invoking
    resched_curr() when the target CPU is offline.

    dt-bindings: serial: Add common rs485 binding for RTS polarity
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6abe9ea8a5a5904d935b8a482117a7fd9b25f09e ]
    
    rs485 allows for robust half-duplex serial communication.  It is often
    implemented by attaching an rs485 transceiver to a UART.  The UART's
    RTS line is wired to the transceiver's Transmit Enable pin and
    determines whether the transceiver is sending or receiving.
    
    Examples for such transceivers are Maxim MAX13451E and TI SN65HVD1781A:
    https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX13450E-MAX13451E.pdf
    http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn65hvd1781a-q1.pdf
    
    In the devicetree, the transceiver itself is not represented, only the
    UART is.  A few rs485-specific dt-bindings already exist and these go
    into the UART's device node.
    
    This commit adds a binding to set the RTS polarity.  Most (if not all)
    transceivers require the Transmit Enable pin be driven high for sending,
    but in some cases boards may negate the pin and RTS must then be driven
    low.  Consequently the polarity defaults to active high but can be
    inverted with the newly added "rs485-rts-active-low" binding.
    
    Document this binding in rs485.txt and in the two drivers fsl-imx-uart
    and fsl-lpuart that are about to be amended with support for it.
    
    Curiously, the omap_serial driver defaults to active low and already
    supports an "rs485-rts-active-high" binding to invert the polarity.
    This is left unchanged to retain compatibility, but the binding is
    herewith documented.

    USB: ledtrig-usbport: fix of-node leak
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 03310a15484ab6a8f6d91bbf7fe486b17275c09a ]
    
    This code looks up a USB device node from a given parent USB device but
    never dropped its reference to the returned node.
    
    As only the address of the node is used for a later matching, the
    reference can be dropped immediately.
    
    Note that this trigger implementation confuses the description of the
    USB device connected to a port with the port itself (which does not have
    a device-tree representation).

    typec: tcpm: fusb302: Resolve out of order messaging events
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ab69f61321140ff632d560775bc226259a78dfa2 ]
    
    The expectation in the FUSB302 driver is that a TX_SUCCESS event
    should occur after a message has been sent, but before a GCRCSENT
    event is raised to indicate successful receipt of a message from
    the partner. However in some circumstances it is possible to see
    the hardware raise a GCRCSENT event before a TX_SUCCESS event
    is raised. The upshot of this is that the GCRCSENT handling portion
    of code ends up reporting the GoodCRC message to TCPM because the
    TX_SUCCESS event hasn't yet arrived to trigger a consumption of it.
    When TX_SUCCESS is then raised by the chip it ends up consuming the
    actual message that was meant for TCPM, and this incorrect sequence
    results in a hard reset from TCPM.
    
    To avoid this problem, this commit updates the message reading
    code to check whether a GoodCRC message was received or not. Based
    on this check it will either report that the previous transmission
    has completed or it will pass the msg data to TCPM for futher
    processing. This way the incorrect ordering of the events no longer
    matters.

    iwlwifi: mvm: rs: don't override the rate history in the search cycle
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 992172e3aec19e5b0ea5b757ba40a146b9282d1e ]
    
    When we are in a search cycle, we try different combinations
    of parameters. Those combinations are called 'columns'.
    When we switch to a new column, we first need to check if
    this column has a suitable rate, if not, we can't try it.
    This means we must not erase the statistics we gathered
    for the previous column until we are sure that we are
    indeed switching column.
    
    The code that tries to switch to a new column first sets
    a whole bunch of things for the new column, and only then
    checks that we can find suitable rates in that column.
    While doing that, the code mistakenly erased the rate
    statistics. This code was right until
    struct iwl_scale_tbl_info grew up for TPC.
    
    Fix this to make sure we don't erase the rate statistics
    until we are sure that we can indeed switch to the new
    column.
    
    Note that this bug is really harmless since it causes a
    change in the behavior only when we can't find any rate
    in the new column which should really not happen. In the
    case we do find a suitable we reset the rate statistics
    a few lines later anyway.

    This fixes a typo where the intent was to assign to 'j' in order to
    skip some number of bits in the dirty bitmap for a guest.  The effect

    video/hdmi: Allow "empty" HDMI infoframes
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 593f4b19a094c4426bd1e1e3cbab87a48bd13c71 ]
    
    HDMI 2.0 Appendix F suggest that we should keep sending the infoframe
    when switching from 3D to 2D mode, even if the infoframe isn't strictly
    necessary (ie. not needed to transmit the VIC or stereo information).
    This is a workaround against some sinks that fail to realize that they
    should switch from 3D to 2D mode when the source stop transmitting
    the infoframe.

    dma-buf/fence: Fix lock inversion within dma-fence-array
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 03e4e0a9e02cf703da331ff6cfd57d0be9bf5692 ]
    
    Ages ago Rob Clark noted,
    
    "Currently with fence-array, we have a potential deadlock situation.  If
    we fence_add_callback() on an array-fence, the array-fence's lock is
    acquired first, and in it's ->enable_signaling() callback, it will install
    cbs on it's array-member fences, so the array-member's lock is acquired
    second.
    
    But in the signal path, the array-member's lock is acquired first, and
    the array-fence's lock acquired second."
    
    Rob proposed either extensive changes to dma-fence to unnest the
    fence-array signaling, or to defer the signaling onto a workqueue. This
    is a more refined version of the later, that should keep the latency
    of the fence signaling to a minimum by using an irq-work, which is
    executed asap.

    drm/edid: set ELD connector type in drm_edid_to_eld()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1d1c36650752b7fb81cee515a9bba4131cac4b7c ]
    
    Since drm_edid_to_eld() knows the connector type, we can set the type in
    ELD while at it. Most connectors this gets called on are not DP
    encoders, and with the HDMI type being 0, this does not change behaviour
    for non-DP.
    
    For i915 having this in place earlier would have saved a considerable
    amount of debugging that lead to the fix 2d8f63297b9f ("drm/i915: always
    update ELD connector type after get modes"). I don't see other drivers,
    even the ones calling drm_edid_to_eld() on DP connectors, setting the
    connector type in ELD.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Avoid shifts by negative amounts
    
    
    [ Upstream commit cda2eaa35948893d70145490d5d6ded546fc3bc6 ]
    
    The kvmppc_hpte_page_shifts function decodes the actual and base page
    sizes for a HPTE, returning -1 if it doesn't recognize the page size
    encoding.  This then gets used as a shift amount in various places,
    which is undefined behaviour.  This was reported by Coverity.
    
    In fact this should never occur, since we should only get HPTEs in the
    HPT which have a recognized page size encoding.  The only place where
    this might not be true is in the call to kvmppc_actual_pgsz() near the
    beginning of kvmppc_do_h_enter(), where we are validating the HPTE
    value passed in from the guest.
    
    So to fix this and eliminate the undefined behaviour, we make
    kvmppc_hpte_page_shifts return 0 for unrecognized page size encodings,
    and make kvmppc_actual_pgsz() detect that case and return 0 for the
    page size, which will then cause kvmppc_do_h_enter() to return an
    error and refuse to insert any HPTE with an unrecognized page size
    encoding.
    
    To ensure that we don't get undefined behaviour in compute_tlbie_rb(),
    we take the 4k page size path for any unrecognized page size encoding.
    This should never be hit in practice because it is only used on HPTE
    values which have previously been checked for having a recognized
    page size encoding.

    HID: multitouch: Only look at non touch fields in first packet of a frame
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 55746d28d66860bccaae20a67b55b9d5db7c14af ]
    
    Devices in "single finger hybrid mode" will send one report per finger,
    on some devices only the first report of such a multi-packet frame will
    contain a value for BTN_LEFT, in subsequent reports (if multiple fingers
    are down) the value is always 0, causing hid-mt to report BTN_LEFT going
    1 - 0 - 1 - 0 when pressing a clickpad and putting down a second finger.
    This happens for example on USB 0603:0002 mt touchpads.
    
    This commit fixes this by only reporting non touch fields for the first
    packet of a (possibly) multi-packet frame.

    spi: imx: Fix failure path leak on GPIO request error correctly
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 8197f489f4c4398391746a377c10501076b05168 ]
    
    In commit 974488e4ce1e ("spi: imx: Fix failure path leak on GPIO request
    error"), spi_bitbang_start() was moved later in the probe sequence.  But
    this doesn't work, as spi_bitbang_start() has to be called before
    requesting GPIOs because the GPIO data in the spi master is populated when
    the master is registed, and that doesn't happen until spi_bitbang_start()
    is called.  The default only works if one uses one CS.
    
    So add a failure path call to spi_bitbang_stop() to fix the leak.

    commit 084a804e01205bcd74cd0849bc72cb5c88f8e648 upstream.
    
    To reproduce the lock up do the following
    - connect otg host adapter and a USB device to the dual-role port
    so that it is in host mode.
    - suspend to mem.
    - disconnect otg adapter.
    - resume the system.
    
    If we call dwc3_host_exit() before tasks are thawed
    xhci_plat_remove() seems to lock up at the second usb_remove_hcd() call.
    
    To work around this we queue the _dwc3_set_mode() work on
    the system_freezable_wq.

    usb: quirks: add control message delay for 1b1c:1b20
    
    commit cb88a0588717ba6c756cb5972d75766b273a6817 upstream.
    
    Corsair Strafe RGB keyboard does not respond to usb control messages
    sometimes and hence generates timeouts.
    
    Commit de3af5bf259d ("usb: quirks: add delay init quirk for Corsair
    Strafe RGB keyboard") tried to fix those timeouts by adding
    USB_QUIRK_DELAY_INIT.
    
    Unfortunately, even with this quirk timeouts of usb_control_msg()
    can still be seen, but with a lower frequency (approx. 1 out of 15):
    
    [   29.103520] usb 1-8: string descriptor 0 read error: -110
    [   34.363097] usb 1-8: can't set config #1, error -110
    
    Adding further delays to different locations where usb control
    messages are issued just moves the timeouts to other locations,
    e.g.:
    
    [   35.400533] usbhid 1-8:1.0: can't add hid device: -110
    [   35.401014] usbhid: probe of 1-8:1.0 failed with error -110
    
    The only way to reliably avoid those issues is having a pause after
    each usb control message. In approx. 200 boot cycles no more timeouts
    were seen.
    
    Addionaly, keep USB_QUIRK_DELAY_INIT as it turned out to be necessary
    to have the delay in hub_port_connect() after hub_port_init().
    
    The overall boot time seems not to be influenced by these additional
    delays, even on fast machines and lightweight distributions.

    usbip: vudc: fix null pointer dereference on udc->lock
    
    commit df3334c223a033f562645712e832ca4cbb326bbf upstream.
    
    Currently the driver attempts to spin lock on udc->lock before a NULL
    pointer check is performed on udc, hence there is a potential null
    pointer dereference on udc->lock.  Fix this by moving the null check
    on udc before the lock occurs.

    staging: android: ashmem: Fix lockdep issue during llseek
    
    commit cb57469c9573f6018cd1302953dd45d6e05aba7b upstream.
    
    ashmem_mutex create a chain of dependencies like so:
    
    (1)
    mmap syscall ->
      mmap_sem ->  (acquired)
      ashmem_mmap
      ashmem_mutex (try to acquire)
      (block)
    
    (2)
    llseek syscall ->
      ashmem_llseek ->
      ashmem_mutex ->  (acquired)
      inode_lock ->
      inode->i_rwsem (try to acquire)
      (block)
    
    (3)
    getdents ->
      iterate_dir ->
      inode_lock ->
      inode->i_rwsem   (acquired)
      copy_to_user ->
      mmap_sem         (try to acquire)
    
    There is a lock ordering created between mmap_sem and inode->i_rwsem
    causing a lockdep splat [2] during a syzcaller test, this patch fixes
    the issue by unlocking the mutex earlier. Functionally that's Ok since
    we don't need to protect vfs_llseek.

    commit 191edc5e2e515aab1075a3f0ef23599e80be5f59 upstream.
    
    When a USB device gets plugged on ASUS PRIME B350M-A's front ports, the

    Delay before running xHC command CMD_RUN can workaround the issue.
    
    Use a new quirk to make the delay only targets to the affected xHC.

    ASoC: wm_adsp: For TLV controls only register TLV get/set
    
    commit d7789f5bcdb298c4a302db471b1b20f74a20de95 upstream.
    
    Normal 512-byte get/set of a TLV isn't supported but we were
    registering the normal get/set anyway and relying on omitting
    the SNDRV_CTL_ELEM_ACCESS_[READ|WRITE] flags to prevent them
    being called.
    
    Trouble is if this gets broken in the core ALSA code - as it has
    been since at least 4.14 - the standard get/set can be called
    unexpectedly and corrupt memory.
    
    There's no point providing functions that won't be called and
    it's a trivial change. The benefit is that if the ALSA core gets
    broken again we get a big fat immediate NULL dereference instead
    of a memory corruption timebomb.

    resync to fix the problem.

    x86: Treat R_X86_64_PLT32 as R_X86_64_PC32
    
    commit b21ebf2fb4cde1618915a97cc773e287ff49173e upstream.
    
    On i386, there are 2 types of PLTs, PIC and non-PIC.  PIE and shared
    objects must use PIC PLT.  To use PIC PLT, you need to load
    _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ into EBX first.  There is no need for that on
    x86-64 since x86-64 uses PC-relative PLT.
    
    On x86-64, for 32-bit PC-relative branches, we can generate PLT32
    relocation, instead of PC32 relocation, which can also be used as
    a marker for 32-bit PC-relative branches.  Linker can always reduce
    PLT32 relocation to PC32 if function is defined locally.   Local
    functions should use PC32 relocation.  As far as Linux kernel is
    concerned, R_X86_64_PLT32 can be treated the same as R_X86_64_PC32
    since Linux kernel doesn't use PLT.
    
    R_X86_64_PLT32 for 32-bit PC-relative branches has been enabled in
    binutils master branch which will become binutils 2.31.
    
    [ hjl is working on having better documentation on this all, but a few
      more notes from him:
    
       "PLT32 relocation is used as marker for PC-relative branches. Because
        of EBX, it looks odd to generate PLT32 relocation on i386 when EBX
        doesn't have GOT.
    
        As for symbol resolution, PLT32 and PC32 relocations are almost
        interchangeable. But when linker sees PLT32 relocation against a
        protected symbol, it can resolved locally at link-time since it is
        used on a branch instruction. Linker can't do that for PC32
        relocation"
    
      but for the kernel use, the two are basically the same, and this
      commit gets things building and working with the current binutils
      master   - Linus ]
