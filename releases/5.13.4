    seq_file: disallow extremely large seq buffer allocations
    
    commit 8cae8cd89f05f6de223d63e6d15e31c8ba9cf53b upstream.
    
    There is no reasonable need for a buffer larger than this, and it avoids
    int overflow pitfalls.

    This patch fixes a trivial mistake that I made in the previous attempt

    perf tools: Fix pattern matching for same substring in different PMU type
    
    [ Upstream commit c47a5599eda324bacdacd125227a0925d6c50fbe ]
    
    Some different PMU types may have the same substring. For example, on
    Icelake server we have PMU types "uncore_imc" and
    "uncore_imc_free_running". Both PMU types have the substring
    "uncore_imc".  But the parser wrongly thinks they are the same PMU type.
    
    We enable an imc event,
    perf stat -e uncore_imc/event=0xe3/ -a -- sleep 1
    
    Perf actually expands the event to:
    
      uncore_imc_0/event=0xe3/
      uncore_imc_1/event=0xe3/
      uncore_imc_2/event=0xe3/
      uncore_imc_3/event=0xe3/
      uncore_imc_4/event=0xe3/
      uncore_imc_5/event=0xe3/
      uncore_imc_6/event=0xe3/
      uncore_imc_7/event=0xe3/
      uncore_imc_free_running_0/event=0xe3/
      uncore_imc_free_running_1/event=0xe3/
      uncore_imc_free_running_3/event=0xe3/
      uncore_imc_free_running_4/event=0xe3/
    
    That's because the "uncore_imc_free_running" matches the
    pattern "uncore_imc*".
    
    Now we check that the last characters of PMU name is '_<digit>'.
    
    For example, for pattern "uncore_imc*", "uncore_imc_0" is parsed ok, but
    "uncore_imc_free_running_0" fails.

    MIPS: vdso: Invalid GIC access through VDSO
    
    [ Upstream commit 47ce8527fbba145a7723685bc9a27d9855e06491 ]
    
    Accessing raw timers (currently only CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW) through VDSO
    doesn't return the correct time when using the GIC as clock source.
    The address of the GIC mapped page is in this case not calculated
    correctly. The GIC mapped page is calculated from the VDSO data by
    subtracting PAGE_SIZE:
    
      void *get_gic(const struct vdso_data *data) {
        return (void __iomem *)data - PAGE_SIZE;
      }
    
    However, the data pointer is not page aligned for raw clock sources.
    This is because the VDSO data for raw clock sources (CS_RAW = 1) is
    stored after the VDSO data for coarse clock sources (CS_HRES_COARSE = 0).
    Therefore, only the VDSO data for CS_HRES_COARSE is page aligned:
    
      +--------------------+
      |                    |
      | vd[CS_RAW]         | ---+
      | vd[CS_HRES_COARSE] |    |
      +--------------------+    | -PAGE_SIZE
      |                    |    |
      |  GIC mapped page   | <--+
      |                    |
      +--------------------+
    
    When __arch_get_hw_counter() is called with &vd[CS_RAW], get_gic returns
    the wrong address (somewhere inside the GIC mapped page). The GIC counter
    values are not returned which results in an invalid time.

    perf script python: Fix buffer size to report iregs in perf script
    
    [ Upstream commit dea8cfcc33695f70f56023b416cf88ae44c8a45a ]
    
    Commit 48a1f565261d2ab1 ("perf script python: Add more PMU fields to
    event handler dict") added functionality to report fields like weight,
    iregs, uregs etc via perf report.  That commit predefined buffer size to
    512 bytes to print those fields.
    
    But in PowerPC, since we added extended regs support in:
    
      068aeea3773a6f4c ("perf powerpc: Support exposing Performance Monitor Counter SPRs as part of extended regs")
      d735599a069f6936 ("powerpc/perf: Add extended regs support for power10 platform")
    
    Now iregs can carry more bytes of data and this predefined buffer size
    can result to data loss in perf script output.
    
    This patch resolves this issue by making the buffer size dynamic, based
    on the number of registers needed to print. It also changes the
    regs_map() return type from int to void, as it is not being used by the
    set_regs_in_dict(), its only caller.

    mips: always link byteswap helpers into decompressor
    
    [ Upstream commit cddc40f5617e53f97ef019d5b29c1bd6cbb031ec ]
    
    My series to clean up the unaligned access implementation
    across architectures caused some mips randconfig builds to
    fail with:
    
       mips64-linux-ld: arch/mips/boot/compressed/decompress.o: in function `decompress_kernel':
       decompress.c:(.text.decompress_kernel+0x54): undefined reference to `__bswapsi2'
    
    It turns out that this problem has already been fixed for the XZ
    decompressor but now it also shows up in (at least) LZO and LZ4.  From my
    analysis I concluded that the compiler could always have emitted those
    calls, but the different implementation allowed it to make otherwise
    better decisions about not inlining the byteswap, which results in the
    link error when the out-of-line code is missing.
    
    While it could be addressed by adding it to the two decompressor
    implementations that are known to be affected, but as this only adds
    112 bytes to the kernel, the safer choice is to always add them.

    sched/uclamp: Ignore max aggregation if rq is idle
    
    [ Upstream commit 3e1493f46390618ea78607cb30c58fc19e2a5035 ]
    
    When a task wakes up on an idle rq, uclamp_rq_util_with() would max
    aggregate with rq value. But since there is no task enqueued yet, the
    values are stale based on the last task that was running. When the new
    task actually wakes up and enqueued, then the rq uclamp values should
    reflect that of the newly woken up task effective uclamp values.
    
    This is a problem particularly for uclamp_max because it default to
    1024. If a task p with uclamp_max = 512 wakes up, then max aggregation
    would ignore the capping that should apply when this task is enqueued,
    which is wrong.
    
    Fix that by ignoring max aggregation if the rq is idle since in that
    case the effective uclamp value of the rq will be the ones of the task
    that will wake up.

    Re-add the regulator-always-on property for vcc_sdio which supplies sdmmc,
    since it gets disabled during reboot now and the bootrom expects it to be
    enabled  when booting from SD card. This makes rebooting impossible in that
    case and requires a hard reset to boot again.

    kbuild: remove trailing slashes from $(KBUILD_EXTMOD)
    
    [ Upstream commit 74ee585b7eecd98be3650e677625a0ee588d08e0 ]
    
    M= (or KBUILD_EXTMOD) generally expects a directory path without any
    trailing slashes, like M=a/b/c.
    
    If you add a trailing slash, like M=a/b/c/, you will get ugly build
    logs (two slashes in a series), but it still works fine as long as it
    is consistent between 'make modules' and 'make modules_install'.
    
    The following commands correctly build and install the modules.
    
      $ make M=a/b/c/ modules
      $ sudo make M=a/b/c/ modules_install
    
    Since commit ccae4cfa7bfb ("kbuild: refactor scripts/Makefile.modinst"),
    a problem happens if you add a trailing slash only for modules_install.
    
      $ make M=a/b/c modules
      $ sudo make M=a/b/c/ modules_install
    
    No module is installed in this case, Johannes Berg reported. [1]
    
    Trim any trailing slashes from $(KBUILD_EXTMOD).
    
    I used the 'dirname' command to remove all the trailing slashes in
    case someone adds more slashes like M=a/b/c/////. The Make's built-in
    function, $(dir ...) cannot take care of such a case.

    [ Upstream commit 50c9bfca1bfe9ffd56d8c5deecf9204d14e20bfd ]
    
    The current device tree CPSW3g node adds non-zero "mac-address" property to
    the ports, which prevents random MAC address assignment to network devices
    if bootloader failed to update DT. This may cause more then one host to
    have the same MAC in the network.
    
     mac-address = [00 00 de ad be ef];
     mac-address = [00 01 de ad be ef];
    
    In addition, there is one MAC address available in eFuse registers which
    can be used for default port 1.
    
    Hence, fix ports MAC properties by:
    - resetting "mac-address" property to 0
    - adding ti,syscon-efuse = <&main_conf 0x200> to Port 1

    USB4 is only present in DRA74x variants, so keeping the entry in
    dra74x.dtsi and removing it from the top level interconnect hierarchy
    dra7-l4.dtsi file. This change makes the USB4 target module no longer
    visible to AM5718, DRA71x and DRA72x so removing references to it in
    their respective dts files.

    arm64: dts: allwinner: a64-sopine-baseboard: change RGMII mode to TXID
    
    [ Upstream commit bd5431b2f9b30a70f6ed964dd5ee9a6d1c397c06 ]
    
    Although the schematics of Pine A64-LTS and SoPine Baseboard shows both
    the RX and TX internal delay are enabled, they're using the same broken
    RTL8211E chip batch with Pine A64+, so they should use TXID instead, not
    ID.
    
    In addition, by checking the real components soldered on both a SoPine
    Baseboard and a Pine A64-LTS, RX delay is not enabled (GR69 soldered and
    GR70 NC) despite the schematics says it's enabled. It's a common
    situation for Pine64 boards that the NC information on schematics is not
    the same with the board.
    
    So the RGMII delay mode should be TXID on these boards.

    firmware: arm_scmi: Reset Rx buffer to max size during async commands
    
    [ Upstream commit 0cb7af474e0dbb2f500c67aa62b6db9fafa74de2 ]
    
    During an async commands execution the Rx buffer length is at first set
    to max_msg_sz when the synchronous part of the command is first sent.
    However once the synchronous part completes the transport layer waits
    for the delayed response which will be processed using the same xfer
    descriptor initially allocated. Since synchronous response received at
    the end of the xfer will shrink the Rx buffer length to the effective
    payload response length, it needs to be reset again.
    
    Raise the Rx buffer length again to max_msg_sz before fetching the
    delayed response to ensure full response is read correctly from the
    shared memory.

    soc: mtk-pm-domains: Fix the clock prepared issue
    
    [ Upstream commit f0fce06e345dc4f75c1cdd21840780f5fe2df1f3 ]
    
    In this new power domain driver, when adding one power domain
    it will prepare the dependent clocks at the same.
    So we only do clk_bulk_enable/disable control during power ON/OFF.
    When system suspend, the pm runtime framework will forcely power off
    power domains. However, the dependent clocks are disabled but kept
    prepared.
    
    In MediaTek clock drivers, PLL would be turned ON when we do
    clk_bulk_prepare control.
    
    Clock hierarchy:
    PLL -->
           DIV_CK -->
                     CLK_MUX
                     (may be dependent clocks)
                             -->
                                 SUBSYS_CG
                                 (may be dependent clocks)
    
    It will lead some unexpected clock states during system suspend.
    This patch will fix by doing prepare_enable/disable_unprepare on
    dependent clocks at the same time while we are going to power on/off
    any power domain.

    [ Upstream commit eed6ff1bb2da65067d928f4ab322c7d75f944fa4 ]
    
    Mediatek requires mmsys clocks to be unprepared during suspend,
    otherwise system has chances to hang.
    
    syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle_optional() will attach and prepare the
    first clock in smi node, leading to additional prepare to the clock
    which is not balanced with the prepare/unprepare pair in resume/suspend
    callbacks.
    
    If a power domain node requests an smi node and the smi node's first
    clock is an mmsys clock, it will results in an unstable suspend resume.

    [ Upstream commit 7fea67710e9f6a111a2c9440576f2396ccd92d57 ]
    
    When call irq_get_irq_data() to get the IRQ's irq_data failed, an
    appropriate error code -ENOENT should be returned. However, we directly
    return 'err', which records the IRQ number instead of the error code.

    arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Fix sc7180-qmp-usb3-dp-phy reg sizes
    
    [ Upstream commit c1124180eb9883891ad2acef89c9d17d6190eab4 ]
    
    As per Dmitry Baryshkov [1]:
    a) The 2nd "reg" should be 0x3c because "Offset 0x38 is
       USB3_DP_COM_REVISION_ID3 (not used by the current driver though)."
    b) The 3rd "reg" "is a serdes region and qmp_v3_dp_serdes_tbl contains
       registers 0x148 and 0x154."
    
    I think because the 3rd "reg" is a serdes region we should just use
    the same size as the 1st "reg"?

    ARM: dts: stm32: Rework LAN8710Ai PHY reset on DHCOM SoM
    
    [ Upstream commit 1cebcf9932ab76102e8cfc555879574693ba8956 ]
    
    The Microchip LAN8710Ai PHY requires XTAL1/CLKIN external clock to be
    enabled when the nRST is toggled according to datasheet Microchip
    LAN8710A/LAN8710Ai DS00002164B page 35 section 3.8.5.1 Hardware Reset:
      "
      A Hardware reset is asserted by driving the nRST input pin low. When
      driven, nRST should be held low for the minimum time detailed in
      Section 5.5.3, "Power-On nRST & Configuration Strap Timing," on page
      59 to ensure a proper transceiver reset. During a Hardware reset, an
      external clock must be supplied to the XTAL1/CLKIN signal.
      "
    This is accidentally fulfilled in the current setup, where ETHCK_K is used
    to supply both PHY XTAL1/CLKIN and is also fed back through eth_clk_fb to
    supply ETHRX clock of the DWMAC. Hence, the DWMAC enables ETHRX clock,
    that has ETHCK_K as parent, so ETHCK_K clock are also enabled, and then
    the PHY reset toggles.
    
    However, this is not always the case, e.g. in case the PHY XTAL1/CLKIN
    clock are supplied by some other clock source than ETHCK_K or in case
    ETHRX clock are not supplied by ETHCK_K. In the later case, ETHCK_K would
    be kept disabled, while ETHRX clock would be enabled, so the PHY would
    not be receiving XTAL1/CLKIN clock and the reset would fail.
    
    Improve the DT by adding the PHY clock phandle into the PHY node, which
    then also requires moving the PHY reset GPIO specifier in the same place
    and that then also requires correct PHY reset GPIO timing, so add that
    too.
    
    A brief note regarding the timing, the datasheet says the reset should
    stay asserted for at least 100uS and software should wait at least 200nS
    after deassertion. Set both delays to 500uS which should be plenty.

    [ Upstream commit e60fd5ac1f6851be5b2c042b39584bfcf8a66f57 ]
    
    The rmtfs_mem region is a weird one, downstream allocates it
    dynamically, and supports a "qcom,guard-memory" property which when set
    will reserve 4k above and below the rmtfs memory.
    
    A common from qcom 4.9 kernel msm_sharedmem driver:
    
    /*
     * If guard_memory is set, then the shared memory region
     * will be guarded by SZ_4K at the start and at the end.
     * This is needed to overcome the XPU limitation on few
     * MSM HW, so as to make this memory not contiguous with
     * other allocations that may possibly happen from other
     * clients in the system.
    */
    
    When the kernel tries to touch memory that is too close the
    rmtfs region it may cause an XPU violation. Such is the case on the
    OnePlus 6 where random crashes would occur usually after boot.
    
    Reserve 4k above and below the rmtfs_mem to avoid hitting these XPU
    Violations.
    
    This doesn't entirely solve the random crashes on the OnePlus 6/6T but
    it does seem to prevent the ones which happen shortly after modem
    bringup.

    "NAME_SIZE - 1" and the overflow check is dead code.  Fix this by
    using the snprintf() function which returns the number of bytes that
    would have been copied if there was enough space and changing the
    condition from "> NAME_SIZE" to ">= NAME_SIZE".

    rtc: bd70528: fix BD71815 watchdog dependency
    
    [ Upstream commit b0ddc5b170058a9ed3c9f031501d735a4eb8ee89 ]
    
    The added Kconfig dependency is slightly incorrect, which can
    lead to a link failure when the watchdog is a loadable module:
    
    arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: drivers/rtc/rtc-bd70528.o: in function `bd70528_set_rtc_based_timers':
    rtc-bd70528.c:(.text+0x6cc): undefined reference to `bd70528_wdt_set'
    arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: drivers/rtc/rtc-bd70528.o: in function `bd70528_set_time':
    rtc-bd70528.c:(.text+0xaa0): undefined reference to `bd70528_wdt_lock'
    arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: rtc-bd70528.c:(.text+0xab8): undefined reference to `bd70528_wdt_unlock'
    arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: drivers/rtc/rtc-bd70528.o: in function `bd70528_alm_enable':
    rtc-bd70528.c:(.text+0xfc0): undefined reference to `bd70528_wdt_lock'
    arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: rtc-bd70528.c:(.text+0x1030): undefined reference to `bd70528_wdt_unlock'
    
    The problem is that it allows to be built-in if MFD_ROHM_BD71828
    is built-in, even when the watchdog is a loadable module.
    
    Rework this so that having the watchdog as a loadable module always
    forces the rtc to be a module as well instead of built-in,
    regardless of bd71828.

    Commit bbc4d71d6354 ("net: phy: realtek: fix rtl8211e rx/tx delay

    wrong setting.
    
    Following the example of a900cac3750b ("ARM: dts: sun7i: a20: bananapro:
    Fix ethernet phy-mode") the phy-mode is changed to "rgmii-id" which gets
    the Ethernet working again on this board.

    The '.modinfo' section was added in commit 898490c010b5 ("moduleparam:
    Save information about built-in modules in separate file") to the DISCARDS
    macro but Hexagon has never used that macro.  The unification of DISCARDS
    happened in commit 023bf6f1b8bf ("linker script: unify usage of discard
    definition") in 2009, prior to Hexagon being added in 2011.
    
    Switch Hexagon over to the DISCARDS macro so that anything that is
    expected to be discarded gets discarded.

    hexagon: handle {,SOFT}IRQENTRY_TEXT in linker script
    
    [ Upstream commit 6fef087d0d37ba7dba8f3d75566eb4c256cd6742 ]
    
    Patch series "hexagon: Fix build error with CONFIG_STACKDEPOT and select CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_LD_ORPHAN_WARN".
    
    This series fixes an error with ARCH=hexagon that was pointed out by the
    patch "mm/slub: use stackdepot to save stack trace in objects".
    
    The first patch fixes that error by handling the '.irqentry.text' and
    '.softirqentry.text' sections.
    
    The second patch switches Hexagon over to the common DISCARDS macro, which
    should have been done when Hexagon was merged into the tree to match
    commit 023bf6f1b8bf ("linker script: unify usage of discard definition").
    
    The third patch selects CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_LD_ORPHAN_WARN so that something
    like this does not happen again.
    
    This patch (of 3):
    
    Patch "mm/slub: use stackdepot to save stack trace in objects" in -mm
    selects CONFIG_STACKDEPOT when CONFIG_STACKTRACE_SUPPORT is selected and
    CONFIG_STACKDEPOT requires IRQENTRY_TEXT and SOFTIRQENTRY_TEXT to be
    handled after commit 505a0ef15f96 ("kasan: stackdepot: move
    filter_irq_stacks() to stackdepot.c") due to the use of the
    __{,soft}irqentry_text_{start,end} section symbols.  If those sections are
    not handled, the build is broken.

    Add these sections to the Hexagon linker script so the build continues to
    work.  ld.lld's orphan section warning would have caught this prior to the
    -mm commit mentioned above:

    [ Upstream commit aa95edf309ef31e2df4a37ebf0e5c2ca2a6772ab ]
    
    If we have multiple outstanding layoutget requests, the current code to
    update the layout barrier assumes that the outstanding layout stateids
    are updated in order. That's not necessarily the case.
    
    Instead of using the value of lo->plh_outstanding as a guesstimate for
    the window of values we need to accept, just wait to update the window
    until we're processing the last one. The intention here is just to
    ensure that we don't process 2^31 seqid updates without also updating
    the barrier.

    NFS: Fix fscache read from NFS after cache error
    
    [ Upstream commit ba512c1bc3232124567a59a3995c773dc79716e8 ]
    
    Earlier commits refactored some NFS read code and removed
    nfs_readpage_async(), but neglected to properly fixup
    nfs_readpage_from_fscache_complete().  The code path is
    only hit when something unusual occurs with the cachefiles
    backing filesystem, such as an IO error or while a cookie
    is being invalidated.
    
    Mark page with PG_checked if fscache IO completes in error,
    unlock the page, and let the VM decide to re-issue based on
    PG_uptodate.  When the VM reissues the readpage, PG_checked
    allows us to skip over fscache and read from the server.

    NFS: Ensure nfs_readpage returns promptly when internal error occurs
    
    commit e0340f16a08d031de54ed91d26f57c9a966a776a upstream.
    
    A previous refactoring of nfs_readpage() might end up calling
    wait_on_page_locked_killable() even if readpage_async_filler() failed
    with an internal error and pg_error was non-zero (for example, if
    nfs_create_request() failed).  In the case of an internal error,
    skip over wait_on_page_locked_killable() as this is only needed
    when the read is sent and an error occurs during completion handling.

    [ Upstream commit ab1016d39cc052064e32f25ad18ef8767a0ee3b8 ]
    
    In error cases the dentry may be NULL.
    
    Before 20798dfe249a, the encoder also checked dentry and
    d_really_is_positive(dentry), but that looks like overkill to me--zero
    status should be enough to guarantee a positive dentry.
    
    This isn't the first time we've seen an error-case NULL dereference
    hidden in the initialization of a local variable in an xdr encoder.  But
    I went back through the other recent rewrites and didn't spot any

    implementations were updated to check for the immediate field and to
    reject programs utilizing anything more than BPF_ADD (such as BPF_FETCH)
    in the immediate field.
    
    However, the check added to powerpc64 JIT did not look at the correct
    BPF instruction. Due to this, such programs would be accepted and
    incorrectly JIT'ed resulting in soft lockups, as seen with the atomic
    bounds test. Fix this by looking at the correct immediate value.

    nvme-tcp: can't set sk_user_data without write_lock
    
    [ Upstream commit 0755d3be2d9bb6ea38598ccd30d6bbaa1a5c3a50 ]
    
    The sk_user_data pointer is supposed to be modified only while
    holding the write_lock "sk_callback_lock", otherwise
    we could race with other threads and crash the kernel.
    
    we can't take the write_lock in nvmet_tcp_state_change()
    because it would cause a deadlock, but the release_work queue
    will set the pointer to NULL later so we can simply remove
    the assignment.

    It's unsafe to operate a vq from multiple threads.
    Unfortunately this is exactly what we do when invoking
    clean tx poll from rx napi.
    Same happens with napi-tx even without the
    opportunistic cleaning from the receive interrupt: that races
    with processing the vq in start_xmit.
    
    As a fix move everything that deals with the vq to under tx lock.

    [ Upstream commit 7d23dcdf213c2e5f097eb7eec3148c26eb01d59f ]
    
    Before SF support was introduced, the DMA device was equal to
    mdev->device which was in essence equal to pdev->dev.
    
    With SF introduction this is no longer true. It has already been
    handled for vhost_vdpa since the reference to the dma device can from
    within mlx5_vdpa. With virtio_vdpa this broke. To fix this we set the
    real dma device when initializing the device.
    
    In addition, for the sake of consistency, previous references in the
    code to the dma device are changed to vdev->dma_dev.

    arch_topology: Avoid use-after-free for scale_freq_data
    
    [ Upstream commit 83150f5d05f065fb5c12c612f119015cabdcc124 ]
    
    Currently topology_scale_freq_tick() (which gets called from
    scheduler_tick()) may end up using a pointer to "struct
    scale_freq_data", which was previously cleared by
    topology_clear_scale_freq_source(), as there is no protection in place
    here. The users of topology_clear_scale_freq_source() though needs a
    guarantee that the previously cleared scale_freq_data isn't used
    anymore, so they can free the related resources.
    
    Since topology_scale_freq_tick() is called from scheduler tick, we don't
    want to add locking in there. Use the RCU update mechanism instead
    (which is already used by the scheduler's utilization update path) to
    guarantee race free updates here.
    
    synchronize_rcu() makes sure that all RCU critical sections that started
    before it is called, will finish before it returns. And so the callers
    of topology_clear_scale_freq_source() don't need to worry about their
    callback getting called anymore.

    nfs: update has_sec_mnt_opts after cloning lsm options from parent
    
    [ Upstream commit eae00c5d6e48ccb2d78ae5873743d7d1a572951b ]
    
    After calling security_sb_clone_mnt_opts() in nfs_get_root(), it's
    necessary to copy the value of has_sec_mnt_opts from the cloned
    super_block's nfs_server.  Otherwise, calls to nfs_compare_super()
    using this super_block may not return the correct result, leading to
    mount failures.
    
    For example, mounting an nfs server with the following in /etc/exports:
    /export *(rw,insecure,crossmnt,no_root_squash,security_label)
    and having /export/scratch on a separate block device.
    
    mount -o v4.2,context=system_u:object_r:root_t:s0 server:/export/test /mnt/test
    mount -o v4.2,context=system_u:object_r:swapfile_t:s0 server:/export/scratch /mnt/scratch
    
    The second mount would fail with "mount.nfs: /mnt/scratch is busy or
    already mounted or sharecache fail" and "SELinux: mount invalid.  Same
    superblock, different security settings for..." would appear in the
    syslog.
    
    Also while we're in there, replace several instances of "NFS_SB(s)"
    with "server", which was already declared at the top of the
    nfs_get_root().

    pwm: imx1: Don't disable clocks at device remove time
    
    [ Upstream commit 1bc6ea31cb41d50302a3c9b401964cf0a88d41f9 ]
    
    The .remove() callback disables clocks that were not enabled in
    .probe(). So just probing and then unbinding the driver results in a clk
    enable imbalance.
    
    So just drop the call to disable the clocks. (Which BTW was also in the

    PCI: intel-gw: Fix INTx enable
    
    [ Upstream commit 655832d12f2251e04031294f547c86935a0a126d ]
    
    The legacy PCI interrupt lines need to be enabled using PCIE_APP_IRNEN bits
    13 (INTA), 14 (INTB), 15 (INTC) and 16 (INTD). The old code however was
    taking (for example) "13" as raw value instead of taking BIT(13).  Define
    the legacy PCI interrupt bits using the BIT() macro and then use these in
    PCIE_APP_IRN_INT.

    x86/fpu: Fix copy_xstate_to_kernel() gap handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 9625895011d130033d1bc7aac0d77a9bf68ff8a6 ]
    
    The gap handling in copy_xstate_to_kernel() is wrong when XSAVES is in
    use.
    
    Using init_fpstate for copying the init state of features which are
    not set in the xstate header is only correct for the legacy area, but
    not for the extended features area because when XSAVES is in use then
    init_fpstate is in compacted form which means the xstate offsets which
    are used to copy from init_fpstate are not valid.
    
    Fortunately, this is not a real problem today because all extended
    features in use have an all-zeros init state, but it is wrong
    nevertheless and with a potentially dynamically sized init_fpstate this
    would result in an access outside of the init_fpstate.
    
    Fix this by keeping track of the last copied state in the target buffer and
    explicitly zero it when there is a feature or alignment gap.
    
    Use the compacted offset when accessing the extended feature space in
    init_fpstate.
    
    As this is not a functional issue on older kernels this is intentionally
    not tagged for stable.

    The interrupt affinity scheme used by this driver is incompatible with
    multi-MSI as it implies moving the doorbell address to that of another MSI
    group.  This isn't possible for multi-MSI, as all the MSIs must have the
    same doorbell address. As such it is restricted to systems with a single
    CPU.

    SUNRPC: prevent port reuse on transports which don't request it.
    
    [ Upstream commit bc1c56e9bbe92766d017efb5f0a0c71f80da5570 ]
    
    If an RPC client is created without RPC_CLNT_CREATE_REUSEPORT, it should
    not reuse the source port when a TCP connection is re-established.
    This is currently implemented by preventing the source port being
    recorded after a successful connection (the call to xs_set_srcport()).
    
    However the source port is also recorded after a successful bind in xs_bind().
    This may not be needed at all and certainly is not wanted when
    RPC_CLNT_CREATE_REUSEPORT wasn't requested.
    
    So avoid that assignment when xprt.reuseport is not set.
    
    With this change, NFSv4.1 and later mounts use a different port number on
    each connection.  This is helpful with some firewalls which don't cope
    well with port reuse.

    watchdog: keembay: Update WDT pre-timeout during the initialization
    
    [ Upstream commit 29353816300c79cb5157ed2719cc71285c7b77aa ]
    
    The pretimeout register has a default reset value. Hence
    when a smaller WDT timeout is set which would be lesser than the
    default pretimeout, the system behaves abnormally, starts
    triggering the pretimeout interrupt even when the WDT is
    not enabled, most of the times leading to system crash.
    Hence an update in the pre-timeout is also required for the
    default timeout that is being configured.

    um: Fix stack pointer alignment
    
    [ Upstream commit 558f9b2f94dbd2d5c5c8292aa13e081cc11ea7d9 ]
    
    GCC assumes that stack is aligned to 16-byte on call sites [1].
    Since GCC 8, GCC began using 16-byte aligned SSE instructions to
    implement assignments to structs on stack. When
    CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE is enabled, this affects
    os-Linux/sigio.c, write_sigio_thread:
    
      struct pollfds *fds, tmp;
      tmp = current_poll;
    
    Note that struct pollfds is exactly 16 bytes in size.
    GCC 8+ generates assembly similar to:
    
      movdqa (%rdi),%xmm0
      movaps %xmm0,-0x50(%rbp)
    
    This is an issue, because movaps will #GP if -0x50(%rbp) is not
    aligned to 16 bytes [2], and how rbp gets assigned to is via glibc
    clone thread_start, then function prologue, going though execution
    trace similar to (showing only relevant instructions):
    
      sub    $0x10,%rsi
      mov    %rcx,0x8(%rsi)
      mov    %rdi,(%rsi)
      syscall
      pop    %rax
      pop    %rdi
      callq  *%rax
      push   %rbp
      mov    %rsp,%rbp
    
    The stack pointer always points to the topmost element on stack,
    rather then the space right above the topmost. On push, the
    pointer decrements first before writing to the memory pointed to
    by it. Therefore, there is no need to have the stack pointer
    pointer always point to valid memory unless the stack is poped;
    so the `- sizeof(void *)` in the code is unnecessary.
    
    On the other hand, glibc reserves the 16 bytes it needs on stack
    and pops itself, so by the call instruction the stack pointer
    is exactly the caller-supplied sp. It then push the 16 bytes of
    the return address and the saved stack pointer, so the base
    pointer will be 16-byte aligned if and only if the caller
    supplied sp is 16-byte aligned. Therefore, the caller must supply
    a 16-byte aligned pointer, which `stack + UM_KERN_PAGE_SIZE`
    already satisfies.
    
    On a side note, musl is unaffected by this issue because it forces
    16 byte alignment via `and $-16,%rsi` in its clone wrapper.
    Similarly, glibc i386 is also unaffected because it has
    `andl $0xfffffff0, %ecx`.
    
    To reproduce this bug, enable CONFIG_UML_RTC and
    CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE. uml_rtc will call
    add_sigio_fd which will then cause write_sigio_thread to either go
    into segfault loop or panic with "Segfault with no mm".
    
    Similarly, signal stacks will be aligned by the host kernel upon
    signal delivery. `- sizeof(void *)` to sigaltstack is
    unconventional and extraneous.
    
    On a related note, initialization of longjmp buffers do require
    `- sizeof(void *)`. This is to account for the return address
    that would have been pushed to the stack at the call site.
    
    The reason for uml to respect 16-byte alignment, rather than
    telling GCC to assume 8-byte alignment like the host kernel since
    commit d9b0cde91c60 ("x86-64, gcc: Use
    -mpreferred-stack-boundary=3 if supported"), is because uml links
    against libc. There is no reason to assume libc is also compiled
    with that flag and assumes 8-byte alignment rather than 16-byte.

    This seems to happen fairly easily during READ_PLUS testing on NFS v4.2.
    I found that we could end up accessing xdr->buf->pages[pgnr] with a pgnr
    greater than the number of pages in the array. So let's just return
    early if we're setting base to a point at the end of the page data and
    let xdr_set_tail_base() handle setting up the buffer pointers instead.

    [ Upstream commit f3076cd8d1d5fa64b5e1fa5affc045c2fc123baa ]
    
    The fuel gauge in the RT5033 PMIC has its own I2C bus and interrupt
    line. Therefore, it is not actually part of the RT5033 MFD and needs
    its own of_match_table to probe properly.
    
    Also, given that it's independent of the MFD, there is actually
    no need to make the Kconfig depend on MFD_RT5033. Although the driver
    uses the shared <linux/mfd/rt5033.h> header, there is no compile
    or runtime dependency on the RT5033 MFD driver.

    F2FS does not declare "pre: crc32" softdep. Then every generator (dracut,

    Hence let's use MODULE_SOFTDEP("pre: crc32") in f2fs code.

    x86/signal: Detect and prevent an alternate signal stack overflow
    
    [ Upstream commit 2beb4a53fc3f1081cedc1c1a198c7f56cc4fc60c ]
    
    The kernel pushes context on to the userspace stack to prepare for the
    user's signal handler. When the user has supplied an alternate signal
    stack, via sigaltstack(2), it is easy for the kernel to verify that the
    stack size is sufficient for the current hardware context.
    
    Check if writing the hardware context to the alternate stack will exceed
    it's size. If yes, then instead of corrupting user-data and proceeding with
    the original signal handler, an immediate SIGSEGV signal is delivered.
    
    Refactor the stack pointer check code from on_sig_stack() and use the new
    helper.
    
    While the kernel allows new source code to discover and use a sufficient
    alternate signal stack size, this check is still necessary to protect
    binaries with insufficient alternate signal stack size from data
    corruption.

    power: supply: surface_battery: Fix battery event handling
    
    [ Upstream commit e633f33d2669cb54db2846f9cde08662d254dbd3 ]
    
    The battery subsystem of the Surface Aggregator Module EC requires us to
    register the battery notifier with instance ID 0. However, battery
    events are actually sent with the instance ID corresponding to the
    device, which is nonzero. Thus, the strict-matching approach doesn't
    work here and will discard events that the driver is expected to handle.
    
    To fix this we have to fall back on notifier matching by target-category
    only and have to manually check the instance ID in the notifier
    callback.

    block: fix the problem of io_ticks becoming smaller
    
    [ Upstream commit d80c228d44640f0b47b57a2ca4afa26ef87e16b0 ]
    
    On the IO submission path, blk_account_io_start() may interrupt
    the system interruption. When the interruption returns, the value
    of part->stamp may have been updated by other cores, so the time
    value collected before the interruption may be less than part->
    stamp. So when this happens, we should do nothing to make io_ticks
    more accurate? For kernels less than 5.0, this may cause io_ticks
    to become smaller, which in turn may cause abnormal ioutil values.

    ext4: fix WARN_ON_ONCE(!buffer_uptodate) after an error writing the superblock
    
    [ Upstream commit 558d6450c7755aa005d89021204b6cdcae5e848f ]
    
    If a writeback of the superblock fails with an I/O error, the buffer
    is marked not uptodate.  However, this can cause a WARN_ON to trigger
    when we attempt to write superblock a second time.  (Which might
    succeed this time, for cerrtain types of block devices such as iSCSI
    devices over a flaky network.)
    
    Try to detect this case in flush_stashed_error_work(), and also change
    __ext4_handle_dirty_metadata() so we always set the uptodate flag, not
    just in the nojournal case.
    
    Before this commit, this problem can be repliciated via:
    
    1. dmsetup  create dust1 --table  '0 2097152 dust /dev/sdc 0 4096'
    2. mount  /dev/mapper/dust1  /home/test
    3. dmsetup message dust1 0 addbadblock 0 10
    4. cd /home/test
    5. echo "XXXXXXX" > t

    PCI: rockchip: Register IRQ handlers after device and data are ready
    
    [ Upstream commit 3cf5f7ab230e2b886e493c7a8449ed50e29d2b98 ]
    
    An IRQ handler may be called at any time after it is registered, so
    anything it relies on must be ready before registration.
    
    rockchip_pcie_subsys_irq_handler() and rockchip_pcie_client_irq_handler()
    read registers in the PCIe controller, but we registered them before
    turning on clocks to the controller.  If either is called before the clocks
    are turned on, the register reads fail and the machine hangs.
    
    Similarly, rockchip_pcie_legacy_int_handler() uses rockchip->irq_domain,
    but we installed it before initializing irq_domain.
    
    Register IRQ handlers after their data structures are initialized and
    clocks are enabled.
    
    Found by enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ, which calls the IRQ handler when it
    is being unregistered.  An error during the probe path might cause this
    unregistration and IRQ handler execution before the device or data
    structure init has finished.

    Most of the other DMI strings on these boxes unfortunately contain various
    generic values like "Default string" or "$(DEFAULT_STRING)", so we cannot
    match on them. These devices do have their chassis-type correctly set to a
    value of "3" (desktop) which is a pleasant surprise, so also match on that.
    
    This should avoid the quirk accidentally also getting applied to laptops /
    tablets (which do actually have a battery). Although in my quite large
    database of Bay and Cherry Trail based devices DMIdecode dumps I don't
    have any laptops / tables with a board-name of "T3 MRD", so this should
    not be an issue.

    [ Upstream commit aee8c67a4faa40a8df4e79316dbfc92d123989c1 ]
    
    When *RSTOR from user memory raises an exception, there is no way to
    differentiate them. That's bad because it forces the slow path even when
    the failure was not a fault. If the operation raised eg. #GP then going
    through the slow path is pointless.
    
    Use _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() which stores the trap number and let the exception
    fixup return the negated trap number as error.
    
    This allows to separate the fast path and let it handle faults directly and
    avoid the slow path for all other exceptions.

    fuse: fix illegal access to inode with reused nodeid
    
    [ Upstream commit 15db16837a35d8007cb8563358787412213db25e ]
    
    Server responds to LOOKUP and other ops (READDIRPLUS/CREATE/MKNOD/...)
    with ourarg containing nodeid and generation.
    
    If a fuse inode is found in inode cache with the same nodeid but different
    generation, the existing fuse inode should be unhashed and marked "bad" and
    a new inode with the new generation should be hashed instead.
    
    This can happen, for example, with passhrough fuse filesystem that returns
    the real filesystem ino/generation on lookup and where real inode numbers
    can get recycled due to real files being unlinked not via the fuse
    passthrough filesystem.
    
    With current code, this situation will not be detected and an old fuse
    dentry that used to point to an older generation real inode, can be used to
    access a completely new inode, which should be accessed only via the new
    dentry.
    
    Note that because the FORGET message carries the nodeid w/o generation, the
    server should wait to get FORGET counts for the nlookup counts of the old
    and reused inodes combined, before it can free the resources associated to
    that nodeid.

    virtiofs: propagate sync() to file server
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d82ab251ef0f6e7716279b04e9b5a01a86ca530 ]
    
    Even if POSIX doesn't mandate it, linux users legitimately expect sync() to
    flush all data and metadata to physical storage when it is located on the
    same system.  This isn't happening with virtiofs though: sync() inside the
    guest returns right away even though data still needs to be flushed from
    the host page cache.
    
    This is easily demonstrated by doing the following in the guest:
    
    $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/foo bs=1M count=5K ; strace -T -e sync sync
    5120+0 records in
    5120+0 records out
    5368709120 bytes (5.4 GB, 5.0 GiB) copied, 5.22224 s, 1.0 GB/s
    sync()                                  = 0 <0.024068>
    
    and start the following in the host when the 'dd' command completes
    in the guest:
    
    $ strace -T -e fsync /usr/bin/sync virtiofs/foo
    fsync(3)                                = 0 <10.371640>
    
    There are no good reasons not to honor the expected behavior of sync()
    actually: it gives an unrealistic impression that virtiofs is super fast
    and that data has safely landed on HW, which isn't the case obviously.
    
    Implement a ->sync_fs() superblock operation that sends a new FUSE_SYNCFS
    request type for this purpose.  Provision a 64-bit placeholder for possible
    future extensions.  Since the file server cannot handle the wait == 0 case,
    we skip it to avoid a gratuitous roundtrip.  Note that this is
    per-superblock: a FUSE_SYNCFS is send for the root mount and for each
    submount.
    
    Like with FUSE_FSYNC and FUSE_FSYNCDIR, lack of support for FUSE_SYNCFS in
    the file server is treated as permanent success.  This ensures
    compatibility with older file servers: the client will get the current
    behavior of sync() not being propagated to the file server.
    
    Note that such an operation allows the file server to DoS sync().  Since a
    typical FUSE file server is an untrusted piece of software running in
    userspace, this is disabled by default.  Only enable it with virtiofs for
    now since virtiofsd is supposedly trusted by the guest kernel.

    watchdog: iTCO_wdt: Account for rebooting on second timeout
    
    [ Upstream commit cb011044e34c293e139570ce5c01aed66a34345c ]
    
    This was already attempted to fix via 1fccb73011ea: If the BIOS did not
    enable TCO SMIs, the timer definitely needs to trigger twice in order to
    cause a reboot. If TCO SMIs are on, as well as SMIs in general, we can
    continue to assume that the BIOS will perform a reboot on the first
    timeout.
    
    QEMU with its ICH9 and related BIOS falls into the former category,
    currently taking twice the configured timeout in order to reboot the
    machine. For iTCO version that fall under turn_SMI_watchdog_clear_off,
    this is also true and was currently only addressed for v1, irrespective
    of the turn_SMI_watchdog_clear_off value.

    watchdog: sc520_wdt: Fix possible use-after-free in wdt_turnoff()
    
    [ Upstream commit 90b7c141132244e8e49a34a4c1e445cce33e07f4 ]
    
    This module's remove path calls del_timer(). However, that function
    does not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the
    timer handler may still be running after the driver's remove function
    has finished, which would result in a use-after-free.
    
    Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timer handler
    has finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.

    PCI: Dynamically map ECAM regions
    
    [ Upstream commit 8fe55ef23387ce3c7488375b1fd539420d7654bb ]
    
    Attempting to boot 32-bit ARM kernels under QEMU's 3.x virt models fails
    when we have more than 512M of RAM in the model as we run out of vmalloc
    space for the PCI ECAM regions. This failure will be silent when running
    libvirt, as the console in that situation is a PCI device.
    
    In this configuration, the kernel maps the whole ECAM, which QEMU sets up
    for 256 buses, even when maybe only seven buses are in use.  Each bus uses
    1M of ECAM space, and ioremap() adds an additional guard page between
    allocations. The kernel vmap allocator will align these regions to 512K,
    resulting in each mapping eating 1.5M of vmalloc space. This means we need
    384M of vmalloc space just to map all of these, which is very wasteful of
    resources.
    
    Fix this by only mapping the ECAM for buses we are going to be using.  In
    my setups, this is around seven buses in most guests, which is 10.5M of
    vmalloc space - way smaller than the 384M that would otherwise be required.
    This also means that the kernel can boot without forcing extra RAM into
    highmem with the vmalloc= argument, or decreasing the virtual RAM available
    to the guest.

    PCI: pciehp: Ignore Link Down/Up caused by DPC
    
    [ Upstream commit a97396c6eb13f65bea894dbe7739b2e883d40a3e ]
    
    Downstream Port Containment (PCIe r5.0, sec. 6.2.10) disables the link upon
    an error and attempts to re-enable it when instructed by the DPC driver.
    
    A slot which is both DPC- and hotplug-capable is currently powered off by
    pciehp once DPC is triggered (due to the link change) and powered back up
    on successful recovery.  That's undesirable, the slot should remain powered
    so the hotplugged device remains bound to its driver.  DPC notifies the
    driver of the error and of successful recovery in pcie_do_recovery() and
    the driver may then restore the device to working state.
    
    Moreover, Sinan points out that turning off slot power by pciehp may foil
    recovery by DPC:  Power off/on is a cold reset concurrently to DPC's warm
    reset.  Sathyanarayanan reports extended delays or failure in link
    retraining by DPC if pciehp brings down the slot.
    
    Fix by detecting whether a Link Down event is caused by DPC and awaiting
    recovery if so.  On successful recovery, ignore both the Link Down and the
    subsequent Link Up event.
    
    Afterwards, check whether the link is down to detect surprise-removal or
    another DPC event immediately after DPC recovery.  Ensure that the
    corresponding DLLSC event is not ignored by synthesizing it and invoking
    irq_wake_thread() to trigger a re-run of pciehp_ist().
    
    The IRQ threads of the hotplug and DPC drivers, pciehp_ist() and
    dpc_handler(), race against each other.  If pciehp is faster than DPC, it
    will wait until DPC recovery completes.
    
    Recovery consists of two steps:  The first step (waiting for link
    disablement) is recognizable by pciehp through a set DPC Trigger Status
    bit.  The second step (waiting for link retraining) is recognizable through
    a newly introduced PCI_DPC_RECOVERING flag.
    
    If DPC is faster than pciehp, neither of the two flags will be set and
    pciehp may glean the recovery status from the new PCI_DPC_RECOVERED flag.
    The flag is zero if DPC didn't occur at all, hence DLLSC events are not
    ignored by default.
    
    pciehp waits up to 4 seconds before assuming that DPC recovery failed and
    bringing down the slot.  This timeout is not taken from the spec (it
    doesn't mandate one) but based on a report from Yicong Yang that DPC may
    take a bit more than 3 seconds on HiSilicon's Kunpeng platform.
    
    The timeout is necessary because the DPC Trigger Status bit may never
    clear:  On Root Ports which support RP Extensions for DPC, the DPC driver
    polls the DPC RP Busy bit for up to 1 second before giving up on DPC
    recovery.  Without the timeout, pciehp would then wait indefinitely for DPC
    to complete.
    
    This commit draws inspiration from previous attempts to synchronize DPC
    with pciehp:

    PCI/P2PDMA: Avoid pci_get_slot(), which may sleep
    
    [ Upstream commit 3ec0c3ec2d92c09465534a1ff9c6f9d9506ffef6 ]
    
    In order to use upstream_bridge_distance_warn() from a dma_map function, it
    must not sleep. However, pci_get_slot() takes the pci_bus_sem so it might
    sleep.
    
    In order to avoid this, try to get the host bridge's device from the first
    element in the device list. It should be impossible for the host bridge's
    device to go away while references are held on child devices, so the first
    element should not be able to change and, thus, this should be safe.
    
    Introduce a static function called pci_host_bridge_dev() to obtain the host
    bridge's root device.

    The interrupt line is shared between PMIC and RTC driver, so using level

    The driver has problems with the different components of

    This results in all four subdrivers populating battery
    information to ascertain that it is populated for their
    own needs for example.
    
    Fix this by using component probing and thus expressing
    to the kernel that these are dependent components.
    The probes can happen in any order and will only acquire
    resources such as state container, regulators and
    interrupts and initialize the data structures, but no
    execution happens until the .bind() callback is called.
    
    The charging driver is the main component and binds
    first, then bind in order the three subcomponents:
    ab8500-fg, ab8500-btemp and ab8500-chargalg.
    
    Do some housekeeping while we are moving the code around.

    pwm: spear: Don't modify HW state in .remove callback
    
    [ Upstream commit b601a18f12383001e7a8da238de7ca1559ebc450 ]
    
    A consumer is expected to disable a PWM before calling pwm_put(). And if
    they didn't there is hopefully a good reason (or the consumer needs
    fixing). Also if disabling an enabled PWM was the right thing to do,
    this should better be done in the framework instead of in each low level
    driver.
    
    So drop the hardware modification from the .remove() callback.

    kcov: add __no_sanitize_coverage to fix noinstr for all architectures
    
    [ Upstream commit 540540d06e9d9b3769b46d88def90f7e7c002322 ]
    
    Until now no compiler supported an attribute to disable coverage
    instrumentation as used by KCOV.
    
    To work around this limitation on x86, noinstr functions have their
    coverage instrumentation turned into nops by objtool.  However, this
    solution doesn't scale automatically to other architectures, such as
    arm64, which are migrating to use the generic entry code.
    
    Clang [1] and GCC [2] have added support for the attribute recently.
    [1] https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/280333021e9550d80f5c1152a34e33e81df1e178
    [2] https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;h=cec4d4a6782c9bd8d071839c50a239c49caca689
    The changes will appear in Clang 13 and GCC 12.
    
    Add __no_sanitize_coverage for both compilers, and add it to noinstr.
    
    Note: In the Clang case, __has_feature(coverage_sanitizer) is only true if
    the feature is enabled, and therefore we do not require an additional
    defined(CONFIG_KCOV) (like in the GCC case where __has_attribute(..) is
    always true) to avoid adding redundant attributes to functions if KCOV is
    off.  That being said, compilers that support the attribute will not
    generate errors/warnings if the attribute is redundantly used; however,
    where possible let's avoid it as it reduces preprocessed code size and
    associated compile-time overheads.

    lib/decompress_unlz4.c: correctly handle zero-padding around initrds.
    
    [ Upstream commit 2c484419efc09e7234c667aa72698cb79ba8d8ed ]
    
    lz4 compatible decompressor is simple.  The format is underspecified and
    relies on EOF notification to determine when to stop.  Initramfs buffer
    format[1] explicitly states that it can have arbitrary number of zero
    padding.  Thus when operating without a fill function, be extra careful to
    ensure that sizes less than 4, or apperantly empty chunksizes are treated
    as EOF.
    
    To test this I have created two cpio initrds, first a normal one,
    main.cpio.  And second one with just a single /test-file with content
    "second" second.cpio.  Then i compressed both of them with gzip, and with
    lz4 -l.  Then I created a padding of 4 bytes (dd if=/dev/zero of=pad4 bs=1
    count=4).  To create four testcase initrds:
    
     1) main.cpio.gzip + extra.cpio.gzip = pad0.gzip
     2) main.cpio.lz4  + extra.cpio.lz4 = pad0.lz4
     3) main.cpio.gzip + pad4 + extra.cpio.gzip = pad4.gzip
     4) main.cpio.lz4  + pad4 + extra.cpio.lz4 = pad4.lz4
    
    The pad4 test-cases replicate the initrd load by grub, as it pads and
    aligns every initrd it loads.
    
    All of the above boot, however /test-file was not accessible in the initrd
    for the testcase #4, as decoding in lz4 decompressor failed.  Also an
    error message printed which usually is harmless.
    
    Whith a patched kernel, all of the above testcases now pass, and
    /test-file is accessible.
    
    This fixes lz4 initrd decompress warning on every boot with grub.  And
    more importantly this fixes inability to load multiple lz4 compressed
    initrds with grub.  This patch has been shipping in Ubuntu kernels since
    January 2021.

    i2c: core: Disable client irq on reboot/shutdown
    
    [ Upstream commit b64210f2f7c11c757432ba3701d88241b2b98fb1 ]
    
    If an i2c client receives an interrupt during reboot or shutdown it may
    be too late to service it by making an i2c transaction on the bus
    because the i2c controller has already been shutdown. This can lead to
    system hangs if the i2c controller tries to make a transfer that is
    doomed to fail because the access to the i2c pins is already shut down,
    or an iommu translation has been torn down so i2c controller register
    access doesn't work.
    
    Let's simply disable the irq if there isn't a shutdown callback for an
    i2c client when there is an irq associated with the device. This will
    make sure that irqs don't come in later than the time that we can handle
    it. We don't do this if the i2c client device already has a shutdown
    callback because presumably they're doing the right thing and quieting
    the device so irqs don't come in after the shutdown callback returns.

    m68knommu: fix missing LCD splash screen data initializer
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f605ee17f8e785ba6ff69bee8e584e377a3cf28 ]
    
    The kernel test robot reports that the "screen_bits" splash screen data
    is missing for the dragen platform:
    
        arch/m68k/68000/dragen2.c:73:16: error: 'screen_bits' undeclared (first use in this function)
          73 |  LSSA = (long) screen_bits;
             |                ^~~~~~~~~~~
        arch/m68k/68000/dragen2.c:73:16: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
    
    Digging around a bit I found the screen_bits data structure was originally
    in a screen.h file that was generated from a screen.xbm file. That was
    removed in commit 0c0e6db80683 ("m68k: drop unused parts of 68VZ328
    Makefile").
    
    Other splash screen initializers for 68000 targets are kept here as the
    C data structures so lets do the same for this one. Add the missing
    screen.h file and include it in the dragen specific startup code.

    ALSA: bebob: add support for ToneWeal FW66
    
    [ Upstream commit 50ebe56222bfa0911a932930f9229ee5995508d9 ]
    
    A user of FFADO project reported the issue of ToneWeal FW66. As a result,
    the device is identified as one of applications of BeBoB solution.
    
    I note that in the report the device returns contradictory result in plug
    discovery process for audio subunit. Fortunately ALSA BeBoB driver doesn't
    perform it thus it's likely to handle the device without issues.
    
    I receive no reaction to test request for this patch yet, however it would
    be worth to add support for it.

    [ Upstream commit da9057576785aaab52e706e76c0475c85b77ec14 ]
    
    The tprot() inline asm temporarily changes the program check new psw
    to redirect a potential program check on the diag instruction.
    Restoring of the program check new psw is done in C code behind the
    inline asm.
    
    This can be problematic, especially if the function is inlined, since
    the compiler can reorder instructions in such a way that a different
    instruction, which may result in a program check, might be executed
    before the program check new psw has been restored.
    
    To avoid such a scenario move restoring into the inline asm. For
    consistency reasons move also saving of the original program check new
    psw into the inline asm.

    s390 is the only architecture which makes use of the __no_kasan_or_inline
    attribute for two functions. Given that both stap() and __load_psw_mask()

    [ Upstream commit 07d8ad6fd8a3d47f50595ca4826f41dbf4f3a0c6 ]
    
    Update _tlbiel_pid() such that we can avoid build errors like below when
    using this function in other places.
    
    arch/powerpc/mm/book3s64/radix_tlb.c: In function ‘__radix__flush_tlb_range_psize’:

    selftests/powerpc: Fix "no_handler" EBB selftest
    
    [ Upstream commit 45677c9aebe926192e59475b35a1ff35ff2d4217 ]
    
    The "no_handler_test" in ebb selftests attempts to read the PMU
    registers twice via helper function "dump_ebb_state". First dump is
    just before closing of event and the second invocation is done after
    closing of the event. The original intention of second
    dump_ebb_state was to dump the state of registers at the end of
    the test when the counters are frozen. But this will be achieved
    with the first call itself since sample period is set to low value
    and PMU will be frozen by then. Hence patch removes the
    dump which was done before closing of the event.

    Hyper-V is observed to sometimes set multiple flags in the srb_status, such
    as ABORTED and ERROR. Current code in storvsc_handle_error() handles only a
    single flag being set, and does nothing when multiple flags are set.  Fix
    this by changing the case statement into a series of "if" statements
    testing individual flags. The functionality for handling each flag is
    unchanged.

    [ Upstream commit 1adf30f198c26539a62d761e45af72cde570413d ]
    
    arm_smmu_rpm_get() invokes pm_runtime_get_sync(), which increases the
    refcount of the "smmu" even though the return value is less than 0.
    
    The reference counting issue happens in some error handling paths of

    fails, the caller functions forget to decrease the refcount of "smmu"

    Fix this issue by calling pm_runtime_resume_and_get() instead of

    balanced in case of failure.

    skip this test with the kselftest skip code 4.
    
    Without this patch this test will fail like this on a s390x zVM:

    serial: tty: uartlite: fix console setup
    
    [ Upstream commit d157fca711ad42e75efef3444c83d2e1a17be27a ]
    
    Remove the hack to assign the global console_port variable at probe time.
    This assumption that cons->index is -1 is wrong for systems that specify
    'console=' in the cmdline (or 'stdout-path' in dts). Hence, on such system
    the actual console assignment is ignored, and the first UART that happens
    to be probed is used as console instead.
    
    Move the logic to console_setup() and map the console to the correct port
    through the array of available ports instead.

    [ Upstream commit 0b7cbe811ca524295ea43d9a4d73d3427e419c54 ]
    
    We have started to get a bunch of pointless dmamask not set warnings
    that makes the output of dmesg -l err,warn hard to read with many
    extra warnings:
    
    cpcap-regulator cpcap-regulator.0: DMA mask not set

    This seems to have started with commit 4d8bde883bfb ("OF: Don't set

    DMA, while CPCAP driver and it's children do not. For audio, the
    DMA is handled over I2S bus with the McBSP driver.

    iscsi_queuecommand's call to iscsi_prep_scsi_cmd_pdu->

    scsi: qedi: Fix race during abort timeouts
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ce002366a3fcc3f9616d4583194f65dde0ad253 ]
    
    If the SCSI cmd completes after qedi_tmf_work calls iscsi_itt_to_task then
    the qedi qedi_cmd->task_id could be freed and used for another cmd. If we
    then call qedi_iscsi_cleanup_task with that task_id we will be cleaning up
    the wrong cmd.
    
    Wait to release the task_id until the last put has been done on the
    iscsi_task. Because libiscsi grabs a ref to the task when sending the
    abort, we know that for the non-abort timeout case that the task_id we are
    referencing is for the cmd that was supposed to be aborted.
    
    A latter commit will fix the case where the abort times out while we are
    running qedi_tmf_work.

    The iscsi offload drivers are setting the shost->max_id to the max number
    of sessions they support. The problem is that max_id is not the max number
    of targets but the highest identifier the targets can have. To use it to
    limit the number of targets we need to set it to max sessions - 1, or we
    can end up with a session we might not have preallocated resources for.

    [ Upstream commit ec29d0ac29be366450a7faffbcf8cba3a6a3b506 ]
    
    If we haven't done a unbind target call we can race where
    iscsi_conn_teardown wakes up the EH thread and then frees the conn while
    those threads are still accessing the conn ehwait.
    
    We can only do one TMF per session so this just moves the TMF fields from
    the conn to the session. We can then rely on the
    iscsi_session_teardown->iscsi_remove_session->__iscsi_unbind_session call
    to remove the target and it's devices, and know after that point there is
    no device or scsi-ml callout trying to access the session.

    scsi: megaraid_sas: Handle missing interrupts while re-enabling IRQs
    
    [ Upstream commit 9bedd36e9146b34dda4d6994e3aa1d72bc6442c1 ]
    
    While reenabling the IRQ after IRQ poll there may be a small window for the
    firmware to post the replies with interrupts raised. In that case the
    driver will not see the interrupts which leads to I/O timeout.
    
    This issue only happens when there are many I/O completions on a single
    reply queue. This forces the driver to switch between the interrupt and IRQ
    context.
    
    Make the driver process the reply queue one more time after enabling the
    IRQ.

    [ Upstream commit ae6874ba4b43c5a00065f48599811a09d33b873d ]
    
    Consider the case where a VD is deleted and the targetID of that VD is
    assigned to a newly created VD. If the sequence of deletion/addition of VD
    happens very quickly there is a possibility that second event (VD add)
    occurs even before the driver processes the first event (VD delete).  As
    event processing is done in deferred context the device list remains the
    same (but targetID is re-used) so driver will not learn the VD
    deletion/additon. I/Os meant for the older VD will be directed to new VD
    which may lead to data corruption.
    
    Make driver detect the deleted VD as soon as possible based on the RaidMap
    update and block further I/O to that device.

    [ Upstream commit 8793613de913e03e7c884f4cc56e350bc716431e ]
    
    The description for scsi_mode_sense() claims to return the number of valid
    bytes on success, which is not what the code does.  Additionally there is
    no gain in returning the SCSI status, as everything the callers do is to
    check against scsi_result_is_good(), which is what scsi_mode_sense() does
    already.  So change the calling convention to return a standard error code
    on failure, and 0 on success, and adapt the description and all callers.

    scsi: core: Cap scsi_host cmd_per_lun at can_queue
    
    [ Upstream commit ea2f0f77538c50739b9fb4de4700cee5535e1f77 ]
    
    The sysfs handling function sdev_store_queue_depth() enforces that the sdev
    queue depth cannot exceed shost can_queue. The initial sdev queue depth
    comes from shost cmd_per_lun. However, the LLDD may manually set
    cmd_per_lun to be larger than can_queue, which leads to an initial sdev
    queue depth greater than can_queue.
    
    Such an issue was reported in [0], which caused a hang. That has since been
    fixed in commit fc09acb7de31 ("scsi: scsi_debug: Fix cmd_per_lun, set to
    max_queue").
    
    Stop this possibly happening for other drivers by capping shost cmd_per_lun
    at shost can_queue.

    scsi: lpfc: Fix "Unexpected timeout" error in direct attach topology
    
    [ Upstream commit e30d55137edef47434c40d7570276a0846fe922c ]
    
    An 'unexpected timeout' message may be seen in a point-2-point topology.
    The message occurs when a PLOGI is received before the driver is notified
    of FLOGI completion. The FLOGI completion failure causes discovery to be
    triggered for a second time. The discovery timer is restarted but no new
    discovery activity is initiated, thus the timeout message eventually
    appears.
    
    In point-2-point, when discovery has progressed before the FLOGI completion
    is processed, it is not a failure. Add code to FLOGI completion to detect
    that discovery has progressed and exit the FLOGI handling (noop'ing it).

    d.2 Pro, however it's wrong. The optional card uses DM1000 ASIC and has
    'Mackie DJ Mixer' in its model name of configuration ROM. On the other
    hand, built-in FireWire card for d.2 Pro and d.4 Pro uses OXFW971 ASIC
    and has 'd.Pro' in its model name according to manuals and user
    experiences. The former card is not the card for d.2 Pro. They are similar
    in appearance but different internally.

    going negative anyway.
    
    An alternative would have been to raise the count in these paths, but
    it is not clear why that would be necessary.
    
    Whilst we are here replace some boilerplate with pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

    misc: alcor_pci: fix null-ptr-deref when there is no PCI bridge
    
    [ Upstream commit 3ce3e45cc333da707d4d6eb433574b990bcc26f5 ]
    
    There is an issue with the ASPM(optional) capability checking function.
    A device might be attached to root complex directly, in this case,
    bus->self(bridge) will be NULL, thus priv->parent_pdev is NULL.
    Since alcor_pci_init_check_aspm(priv->parent_pdev) checks the PCI link's
    ASPM capability and populate parent_cap_off, which will be used later by
    alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() to dynamically turn on/off device, what we can do
    here is to avoid checking the capability if we are on the root complex.
    This will make pdev_cap_off 0 and alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() will simply
    return when bring called, effectively disable ASPM for the device.

    misc/libmasm/module: Fix two use after free in ibmasm_init_one
    
    [ Upstream commit 7272b591c4cb9327c43443f67b8fbae7657dd9ae ]
    
    In ibmasm_init_one, it calls ibmasm_init_remote_input_dev().
    Inside ibmasm_init_remote_input_dev, mouse_dev and keybd_dev are
    allocated by input_allocate_device(), and assigned to
    sp->remote.mouse_dev and sp->remote.keybd_dev respectively.
    
    In the err_free_devices error branch of ibmasm_init_one,
    mouse_dev and keybd_dev are freed by input_free_device(), and return
    error. Then the execution runs into error_send_message error branch
    of ibmasm_init_one, where ibmasm_free_remote_input_dev(sp) is called
    to unregister the freed sp->remote.mouse_dev and sp->remote.keybd_dev.
    
    My patch add a "error_init_remote" label to handle the error of
    ibmasm_init_remote_input_dev(), to avoid the uaf bugs.

    serial: 8250: of: Check for CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_BCM7271
    
    [ Upstream commit f5b08386dee439c7a9e60ce0a4a4a705f3a60dff ]
    
    Our SoC's have always had a NS16650A UART core and older SoC's would
    have a compatible string of: 'compatible = ""ns16550a"' and use the
    8250_of driver. Our newer SoC's have added enhancements to the base
    core to add support for DMA and accurate high speed baud rates and use
    this newer 8250_bcm7271 driver. The Device Tree node for our enhanced
    UARTs has a compatible string of: 'compatible = "brcm,bcm7271-uart",
    "ns16550a"''. With both drivers running and the link order setup so
    that the 8250_bcm7217 driver is initialized before the 8250_of driver,
    we should bind the 8250_bcm7271 driver to the enhanced UART, or for
    upstream kernels that don't have the 8250_bcm7271 driver, we bind to
    the 8250_of driver.
    
    The problem is that when both the 8250_of and 8250_bcm7271 drivers
    were running, occasionally the 8250_of driver would be bound to the
    enhanced UART instead of the 8250_bcm7271 driver. This was happening
    because we use SCMI based clocks which come up late in initialization
    and cause probe DEFER's when the two drivers get their clocks.
    
    Occasionally the SCMI clock would become ready between the 8250_bcm7271
    probe and the 8250_of probe and the 8250_of driver would be bound. To
    fix this we decided to config only our 8250_bcm7271 driver and added
    "ns16665a0" to the compatible string so the driver would work on our
    older system.
    
    This commit has of_platform_serial_probe() check specifically for the
    "brcm,bcm7271-uart" and whether its companion driver is enabled. If it
    is the case, and the clock provider is not ready, we want to make sure
    that when the 8250_bcm7271.c driver returns EPROBE_DEFER, we are not
    getting the UART registered via 8250_of.c.

    SYSRQ doesn't work with DMA. This is because there is no error
    indication whether a symbol had a framing error or not. Actually,
    this is not completely correct, there is a bit in the data register
    which is set in this case, but we'd have to read change the DMA access
    to 16 bit and we'd need to post process the data, thus make the DMA
    pointless in the first place.

    soundwire: bus: handle -ENODATA errors in clock stop/start sequences
    
    [ Upstream commit b50bb8ba369cdc8814e82558117711c12ef3af3d ]
    
    If a device lost sync and can no longer ACK a command, it may not be
    able to enter a lower-power state but it will still be able to resync
    when the clock restarts. In those cases, we want to continue with the
    clock stop sequence.
    
    This patch modifies the behavior during clock stop sequences to only
    log errors unrelated to -ENODATA/Command_Ignored. The flow is also
    modified so that loops continue to prepare/deprepare other devices
    even when one seems to have lost sync.
    
    When resuming the clocks, all issues are logged with a dev_warn(),
    previously only some of them were checked. This is the only part that
    now differs between the clock stop entry and clock stop exit
    sequences: while we don't want to stop the suspend flow, we do want
    information on potential issues while resuming, as they may have
    ripple effects.
    
    For consistency the log messages are also modified to be unique and
    self-explanatory. Errors in sdw_slave_clk_stop_callback() were
    removed, they are now handled in the caller.

    soundwire: bus: only use CLOCK_STOP_MODE0 and fix confusions
    
    [ Upstream commit 345e9f5ca798600e44c0843646621f2804eb99f4 ]
    
    Existing devices and implementations only support the required
    CLOCK_STOP_MODE0. All the code related to CLOCK_STOP_MODE1 has not
    been tested and is highly questionable, with a clear confusion between
    CLOCK_STOP_MODE1 and the simple clock stop state machine.
    
    This patch removes all usages of CLOCK_STOP_MODE1 - which has no
    impact on any solution - and fixes the use of the simple clock stop
    state machine. The resulting code should be a lot more symmetrical and
    easier to maintain.
    
    Note that CLOCK_STOP_MODE1 is not supported in the SoundWire Device
    Class specification so it's rather unlikely that we need to re-add
    this mode later.

    rcu: Reject RCU_LOCKDEP_WARN() false positives
    
    [ Upstream commit 3066820034b5dd4e89bd74a7739c51c2d6f5e554 ]
    
    If another lockdep report runs concurrently with an RCU lockdep report
    from RCU_LOCKDEP_WARN(), the following sequence of events can occur:
    
    1.      debug_lockdep_rcu_enabled() sees that lockdep is enabled
            when called from (say) synchronize_rcu().
    
    2.      Lockdep is disabled by a concurrent lockdep report.
    
    3.      debug_lockdep_rcu_enabled() evaluates its lockdep-expression
            argument, for example, lock_is_held(&rcu_bh_lock_map).
    
    4.      Because lockdep is now disabled, lock_is_held() plays it safe and
            returns the constant 1.
    
    5.      But in this case, the constant 1 is not safe, because invoking
            synchronize_rcu() under rcu_read_lock_bh() is disallowed.
    
    6.      debug_lockdep_rcu_enabled() wrongly invokes lockdep_rcu_suspicious(),
            resulting in a false-positive splat.
    
    This commit therefore changes RCU_LOCKDEP_WARN() to check
    debug_lockdep_rcu_enabled() after checking the lockdep expression,
    so that any "safe" returns from lock_is_held() are rejected by
    debug_lockdep_rcu_enabled().  This requires memory ordering, which is
    supplied by READ_ONCE(debug_locks).  The resulting volatile accesses
    prevent the compiler from reordering and the fact that only one variable
    is being accessed prevents the underlying hardware from reordering.
    The combination works for IA64, which can reorder reads to the same
    location, but this is defeated by the volatile accesses, which compile
    to load instructions that provide ordering.

    srcu: Fix broken node geometry after early ssp init
    
    [ Upstream commit b5befe842e6612cf894cf4a199924ee872d8b7d8 ]
    
    An srcu_struct structure that is initialized before rcu_init_geometry()
    will have its srcu_node hierarchy based on CONFIG_NR_CPUS.  Once
    rcu_init_geometry() is called, this hierarchy is compressed as needed
    for the actual maximum number of CPUs for this system.
    
    Later on, that srcu_struct structure is confused, sometimes referring
    to its initial CONFIG_NR_CPUS-based hierarchy, and sometimes instead
    to the new num_possible_cpus() hierarchy.  For example, each of its
    ->mynode fields continues to reference the original leaf rcu_node
    structures, some of which might no longer exist.  On the other hand,
    srcu_for_each_node_breadth_first() traverses to the new node hierarchy.
    
    There are at least two bad possible outcomes to this:
    
    1) a) A callback enqueued early on an srcu_data structure (call it
          *sdp) is recorded pending on sdp->mynode->srcu_data_have_cbs in
          srcu_funnel_gp_start() with sdp->mynode pointing to a deep leaf
          (say 3 levels).
    
       b) The grace period ends after rcu_init_geometry() shrinks the
          nodes level to a single one.  srcu_gp_end() walks through the new
          srcu_node hierarchy without ever reaching the old leaves so the
          callback is never executed.
    
       This is easily reproduced on an 8 CPUs machine with CONFIG_NR_CPUS >= 32
       and "rcupdate.rcu_self_test=1". The srcu_barrier() after early tests
       verification never completes and the boot hangs:

    2) An srcu_struct structure that is initialized before rcu_init_geometry()
       and used afterward will always have stale rdp->mynode references,
       resulting in callbacks to be missed in srcu_gp_end(), just like in
       the previous scenario.
    
    This commit therefore causes init_srcu_struct_nodes to initialize the
    geometry, if needed.  This ensures that the srcu_node hierarchy is
    properly built and distributed from the get-go.

    drm/dp_mst: Avoid to mess up payload table by ports in stale topology
    
    commit 3769e4c0af5b82c8ea21d037013cb9564dfaa51f upstream.
    
    [Why]
    After unplug/hotplug hub from the system, userspace might start to
    clear stale payloads gradually. If we call drm_dp_mst_deallocate_vcpi()
    to release stale VCPI of those ports which are not relating to current
    topology, we have chane to wrongly clear active payload table entry for
    current topology.
    
    E.g.
    We have allocated VCPI 1 in current payload table and we call
    drm_dp_mst_deallocate_vcpi() to clean VCPI 1 in stale topology. In
    drm_dp_mst_deallocate_vcpi(), it will call drm_dp_mst_put_payload_id()
    tp put VCPI 1 and which means ID 1 is available again. Thereafter, if we
    want to allocate a new payload stream, it will find ID 1 is available by
    drm_dp_mst_assign_payload_id(). However, ID 1 is being used
    
    [How]
    Check target sink is relating to current topology or not before doing
    any payload table update.
    Searching upward to find the target sink's relevant root branch device.
    If the found root branch device is not the same root of current
    topology, don't update payload table.

    drm/dp_mst: Do not set proposed vcpi directly
    
    commit 35d3e8cb35e75450f87f87e3d314e2d418b6954b upstream.
    
    [Why]
    When we receive CSN message to notify one port is disconnected, we will
    implicitly set its corresponding num_slots to 0. Later on, we will
    eventually call drm_dp_update_payload_part1() to arrange down streams.
    
    In drm_dp_update_payload_part1(), we iterate over all proposed_vcpis[]
    to do the update. Not specific to a target sink only. For example, if we
    light up 2 monitors, Monitor_A and Monitor_B, and then we unplug
    Monitor_B. Later on, when we call drm_dp_update_payload_part1() to try
    to update payload for Monitor_A, we'll also implicitly clean payload for
    Monitor_B at the same time. And finally, when we try to call
    drm_dp_update_payload_part1() to clean payload for Monitor_B, we will do
    nothing at this time since payload for Monitor_B has been cleaned up
    previously.
    
    For StarTech 1to3 DP hub, it seems like if we didn't update DPCD payload
    ID table then polling for "ACT Handled"(BIT_1 of DPCD 002C0h) will fail
    and this polling will last for 3 seconds.
    
    Therefore, guess the best way is we don't set the proposed_vcpi[]
    diretly. Let user of these herlper functions to set the proposed_vcpi
    directly.
    
    [How]
    1. Revert commit 7617e9621bf2 ("drm/dp_mst: clear time slots for ports
    invalid")
    2. Tackle the issue in previous commit by skipping those trasient
    proposed VCPIs. These stale VCPIs shoulde be explicitly cleared by
    user later on.

    * Amend the commit message to add Fixed & Cc tags

    When syncing the log, if we fail to allocate the root node for the log
    root tree:
    
    1) We are unlocking fs_info->tree_log_mutex, but at this point we have
       not yet locked this mutex;
    
    2) We have locked fs_info->tree_root->log_mutex, but we end up not
       unlocking it;
    
    So fix this by unlocking fs_info->tree_root->log_mutex instead of
    fs_info->tree_log_mutex.

    btrfs: don't block if we can't acquire the reclaim lock
    
    commit 9cc0b837e14ae913581ec1ea6e979a738f71b0fd upstream.
    
    If we can't acquire the reclaim_bgs_lock on block group reclaim, we
    block until it is free. This can potentially stall for a long time.
    
    While reclaim of block groups is necessary for a good user experience on
    a zoned file system, there still is no need to block as it is best
    effort only, just like when we're deleting unused block groups.

    btrfs: rework chunk allocation to avoid exhaustion of the system chunk array
    
    commit 79bd37120b149532af5b21953643ed74af69654f upstream.
    
    Commit eafa4fd0ad0607 ("btrfs: fix exhaustion of the system chunk array
    due to concurrent allocations") fixed a problem that resulted in
    exhausting the system chunk array in the superblock when there are many
    tasks allocating chunks in parallel. Basically too many tasks enter the
    first phase of chunk allocation without previous tasks having finished
    their second phase of allocation, resulting in too many system chunks
    being allocated. That was originally observed when running the fallocate
    tests of stress-ng on a PowerPC machine, using a node size of 64K.
    
    However that commit also introduced a deadlock where a task in phase 1 of
    the chunk allocation waited for another task that had allocated a system
    chunk to finish its phase 2, but that other task was waiting on an extent
    buffer lock held by the first task, therefore resulting in both tasks not
    making any progress. That change was later reverted by a patch with the
    subject "btrfs: fix deadlock with concurrent chunk allocations involving
    system chunks", since there is no simple and short solution to address it
    and the deadlock is relatively easy to trigger on zoned filesystems, while
    the system chunk array exhaustion is not so common.
    
    This change reworks the chunk allocation to avoid the system chunk array
    exhaustion. It accomplishes that by making the first phase of chunk
    allocation do the updates of the device items in the chunk btree and the
    insertion of the new chunk item in the chunk btree. This is done while
    under the protection of the chunk mutex (fs_info->chunk_mutex), in the
    same critical section that checks for available system space, allocates
    a new system chunk if needed and reserves system chunk space. This way
    we do not have chunk space reserved until the second phase completes.
    
    The same logic is applied to chunk removal as well, since it keeps
    reserved system space long after it is done updating the chunk btree.
    
    For direct allocation of system chunks, the previous behaviour remains,
    because otherwise we would deadlock on extent buffers of the chunk btree.
    Changes to the chunk btree are by large done by chunk allocation and chunk
    removal, which first reserve chunk system space and then later do changes
    to the chunk btree. The other remaining cases are uncommon and correspond
    to adding a device, removing a device and resizing a device. All these
    other cases do not pre-reserve system space, they modify the chunk btree
    right away, so they don't hold reserved space for a long period like chunk
    allocation and chunk removal do.
    
    The diff of this change is huge, but more than half of it is just addition
    of comments describing both how things work regarding chunk allocation and
    removal, including both the new behavior and the parts of the old behavior
    that did not change.

    btrfs: fix deadlock with concurrent chunk allocations involving system chunks
    
    commit 1cb3db1cf383a3c7dbda1aa0ce748b0958759947 upstream.
    
    When a task attempting to allocate a new chunk verifies that there is not
    currently enough free space in the system space_info and there is another
    task that allocated a new system chunk but it did not finish yet the
    creation of the respective block group, it waits for that other task to
    finish creating the block group. This is to avoid exhaustion of the system
    chunk array in the superblock, which is limited, when we have a thundering
    herd of tasks allocating new chunks. This problem was described and fixed
    by commit eafa4fd0ad0607 ("btrfs: fix exhaustion of the system chunk array
    due to concurrent allocations").
    
    However there are two very similar scenarios where this can lead to a
    deadlock:
    
    1) Task B allocated a new system chunk and task A is waiting on task B
       to finish creation of the respective system block group. However before
       task B ends its transaction handle and finishes the creation of the
       system block group, it attempts to allocate another chunk (like a data
       chunk for an fallocate operation for a very large range). Task B will
       be unable to progress and allocate the new chunk, because task A set
       space_info->chunk_alloc to 1 and therefore it loops at
       btrfs_chunk_alloc() waiting for task A to finish its chunk allocation
       and set space_info->chunk_alloc to 0, but task A is waiting on task B
       to finish creation of the new system block group, therefore resulting
       in a deadlock;
    
    2) Task B allocated a new system chunk and task A is waiting on task B to
       finish creation of the respective system block group. By the time that
       task B enter the final phase of block group allocation, which happens
       at btrfs_create_pending_block_groups(), when it modifies the extent
       tree, the device tree or the chunk tree to insert the items for some
       new block group, it needs to allocate a new chunk, so it ends up at
       btrfs_chunk_alloc() and keeps looping there because task A has set
       space_info->chunk_alloc to 1, but task A is waiting for task B to
       finish creation of the new system block group and release the reserved
       system space, therefore resulting in a deadlock.
    
    In short, the problem is if a task B needs to allocate a new chunk after
    it previously allocated a new system chunk and if another task A is
    currently waiting for task B to complete the allocation of the new system
    chunk.
    
    Unfortunately this deadlock scenario introduced by the previous fix for
    the system chunk array exhaustion problem does not have a simple and short
    fix, and requires a big change to rework the chunk allocation code so that
    chunk btree updates are all made in the first phase of chunk allocation.
    And since this deadlock regression is being frequently hit on zoned
    filesystems and the system chunk array exhaustion problem is triggered
    in more extreme cases (originally observed on PowerPC with a node size
    of 64K when running the fallocate tests from stress-ng), revert the
    changes from that commit. The next patch in the series, with a subject
    of "btrfs: rework chunk allocation to avoid exhaustion of the system
    chunk array" does the necessary changes to fix the system chunk array
    exhaustion problem.

    the zone size in the zoned mode. The upper limit on zone size is 8GiB so

    btrfs: properly split extent_map for REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND
    
    commit abb99cfdaf0759f8a619e5fecf52ccccdf310c8c upstream.
    
    Damien reported a test failure with btrfs/209. The test itself ran fine,
    but the fsck ran afterwards reported a corrupted filesystem.
    
    The filesystem corruption happens because we're splitting an extent and
    then writing the extent twice. We have to split the extent though, because
    we're creating too large extents for a REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND operation.
    
    When dumping the extent tree, we can see two EXTENT_ITEMs at the same
    start address but different lengths.
    
    $ btrfs inspect dump-tree /dev/nullb1 -t extent
    ...
       item 19 key (269484032 EXTENT_ITEM 126976) itemoff 15470 itemsize 53
               refs 1 gen 7 flags DATA
               extent data backref root FS_TREE objectid 257 offset 786432 count 1
       item 20 key (269484032 EXTENT_ITEM 262144) itemoff 15417 itemsize 53
               refs 1 gen 7 flags DATA
               extent data backref root FS_TREE objectid 257 offset 786432 count 1
    
    The duplicated EXTENT_ITEMs originally come from wrongly split extent_map in
    extract_ordered_extent(). Since extract_ordered_extent() uses
    create_io_em() to split an existing extent_map, we will have
    split->orig_start != split->start. Then, it will be logged with non-zero
    "extent data offset". Finally, the logged entries are replayed into
    a duplicated EXTENT_ITEM.
    
    Introduce and use proper splitting function for extent_map. The function is
    intended to be simple and specific usage for extract_ordered_extent() e.g.
    not supporting compression case (we do not allow splitting compressed
    extent_map anyway).
    
    There was a question raised by Qu, in summary why we want to split the
    extent map (and not the bio):
    
    The problem is not the limit on the zone end, which as you mention is
    the same as the block group end. The problem is that data write use zone
    append (ZA) operations. ZA BIOs cannot be split so a large extent may
    need to be processed with multiple ZA BIOs, While that is also true for
    regular writes, the major difference is that ZA are "nameless" write
    operation giving back the written sectors on completion. And ZA
    operations may be reordered by the block layer (not intentionally
    though). Combine both of these characteristics and you can see that the
    data for a large extent may end up being shuffled when written resulting
    in data corruption and the impossibility to map the extent to some start
    sector.
    
    To avoid this problem, zoned btrfs uses the principle "one data extent
    == one ZA BIO". So large extents need to be split. This is unfortunate,
    but we can revisit this later and optimize, e.g. merge back together the
    fragments of an extent once written if they actually were written
    sequentially in the zone.

    When we use delayed_work for fallback execution of requests, current
    will be not of the submitter task, and so checks in io_req_task_submit()
    may not behave as expected. Currently, it leaves inline completions not
    flushed, so making io_ring_exit_work() to hang. Use the submitter task
    for all those checks.

    arm64: Avoid premature usercopy failure
    
    commit 295cf156231ca3f9e3a66bde7fab5e09c41835e0 upstream.
    
    Al reminds us that the usercopy API must only return complete failure
    if absolutely nothing could be copied. Currently, if userspace does
    something silly like giving us an unaligned pointer to Device memory,
    or a size which overruns MTE tag bounds, we may fail to honour that
    requirement when faulting on a multi-byte access even though a smaller
    access could have succeeded.
    
    Add a mitigation to the fixup routines to fall back to a single-byte
    copy if we faulted on a larger access before anything has been written
    to the destination, to guarantee making *some* forward progress. We
    needn't be too concerned about the overall performance since this should
    only occur when callers are doing something a bit dodgy in the first
    place. Particularly broken userspace might still be able to trick
    generic_perform_write() into an infinite loop by targeting write() at
    an mmap() of some read-only device register where the fault-in load
    succeeds but any store synchronously aborts such that copy_to_user() is
    genuinely unable to make progress, but, well, don't do that...

    mm/hugetlb: fix refs calculation from unaligned @vaddr
    
    commit d08af0a59684e18a51aa4bfd24c658994ea3fc5b upstream.
    
    Commit 82e5d378b0e47 ("mm/hugetlb: refactor subpage recording")
    refactored the count of subpages but missed an edge case when @vaddr is
    not aligned to PAGE_SIZE e.g.  when close to vma->vm_end.  It would then
    errousnly set @refs to 0 and record_subpages_vmas() wouldn't set the
    @pages array element to its value, consequently causing the reported
    null-deref by syzbot.
    
    Fix it by aligning down @vaddr by PAGE_SIZE in @refs calculation.

    cgroup: verify that source is a string
    
    commit 3b0462726e7ef281c35a7a4ae33e93ee2bc9975b upstream.
    
    The following sequence can be used to trigger a UAF:
    
        int fscontext_fd = fsopen("cgroup");
        int fd_null = open("/dev/null, O_RDONLY);
        int fsconfig(fscontext_fd, FSCONFIG_SET_FD, "source", fd_null);
        close_range(3, ~0U, 0);
    
    The cgroup v1 specific fs parser expects a string for the "source"
    parameter.  However, it is perfectly legitimate to e.g.  specify a file
    descriptor for the "source" parameter.  The fs parser doesn't know what
    a filesystem allows there.  So it's a bug to assume that "source" is
    always of type fs_value_is_string when it can reasonably also be
    fs_value_is_file.
    
    This assumption in the cgroup code causes a UAF because struct
    fs_parameter uses a union for the actual value.  Access to that union is
    guarded by the param->type member.  Since the cgroup paramter parser
    didn't check param->type but unconditionally moved param->string into
    fc->source a close on the fscontext_fd would trigger a UAF during
    put_fs_context() which frees fc->source thereby freeing the file stashed
    in param->file causing a UAF during a close of the fd_null.
    
    Fix this by verifying that param->type is actually a string and report
    an error if not.
    
    In follow up patches I'll add a new generic helper that can be used here
    and by other filesystems instead of this error-prone copy-pasta fix.
    But fixing it in here first makes backporting a it to stable a lot
    easier.

    drm/i915/gt: Fix -EDEADLK handling regression
    
    commit 2feeb52859fc1ab94cd35b61ada3a6ac4ff24243 upstream.
    
    The conversion to ww mutexes failed to address the fence code which
    already returns -EDEADLK when we run out of fences. Ww mutexes on
    the other hand treat -EDEADLK as an internal errno value indicating
    a need to restart the operation due to a deadlock. So now when the
    fence code returns -EDEADLK the higher level code erroneously
    restarts everything instead of returning the error to userspace
    as is expected.
    
    To remedy this let's switch the fence code to use a different errno
    value for this. -ENOBUFS seems like a semi-reasonable unique choice.
    Apart from igt the only user of this I could find is sna, and even
    there all we do is dump the current fence registers from debugfs
    into the X server log. So no user visible functionality is affected.
    If we really cared about preserving this we could of course convert
    back to -EDEADLK higher up, but doesn't seem like that's worth
    the hassle here.
    
    Not quite sure which commit specifically broke this, but I'll
    just attribute it to the general gem ww mutex work.

    drm/i915/gtt: drop the page table optimisation
    
    commit 0abb33bfca0fb74df76aac03e90ce685016ef7be upstream.
    
    We skip filling out the pt with scratch entries if the va range covers
    the entire pt, since we later have to fill it with the PTEs for the
    object pages anyway. However this might leave open a small window where
    the PTEs don't point to anything valid for the HW to consume.
    
    When for example using 2M GTT pages this fill_px() showed up as being
    quite significant in perf measurements, and ends up being completely
    wasted since we ignore the pt and just use the pde directly.
    
    Anyway, currently we have our PTE construction split between alloc and
    insert, which is probably slightly iffy nowadays, since the alloc
    doesn't actually allocate anything anymore, instead it just sets up the
    page directories and points the PTEs at the scratch page. Later when we
    do the insert step we re-program the PTEs again. Better might be to
    squash the alloc and insert into a single step, then bringing back this
    optimisation(along with some others) should be possible.

    tracing: Do not reference char * as a string in histograms
    
    commit 704adfb5a9978462cd861f170201ae2b5e3d3a80 upstream.
    
    The histogram logic was allowing events with char * pointers to be used as
    normal strings. But it was easy to crash the kernel with:
    
     # echo 'hist:keys=filename' > events/syscalls/sys_enter_openat/trigger
    
    And open some files, and boom!

    The reason is that filename is a char * to user space, and the histogram

    I originally tried to use strncpy_from_user/kernel_nofault() but found
    that there's other places that its dereferenced and not worth the effort.
    
    Just do not allow "char *" to act like strings.

    This fixes a bug in context cache clear operation. The code was not
    following the correct invalidation flow. A global device TLB invalidation
    should be added after the IOTLB invalidation. At the same time, it
    uses the domain ID from the context entry. But in scalable mode, the
    domain ID is in PASID table entry, not context entry.

    scsi: zfcp: Report port fc_security as unknown early during remote cable pull
    
    commit 8b3bdd99c092bbaeaa7d9eecb1a3e5dc9112002b upstream.
    
    On remote cable pull, a zfcp_port keeps its status and only gets
    ZFCP_STATUS_PORT_LINK_TEST added. Only after an ADISC timeout, we would
    actually start port recovery and remove ZFCP_STATUS_COMMON_UNBLOCKED which
    zfcp_sysfs_port_fc_security_show() detected and reported as "unknown"
    instead of the old and possibly stale zfcp_port->connection_info.
    
    Add check for ZFCP_STATUS_PORT_LINK_TEST for timely "unknown" report.

    scsi: core: Fix bad pointer dereference when ehandler kthread is invalid
    
    commit 93aa71ad7379900e61c8adff6a710a4c18c7c99b upstream.
    
    Commit 66a834d09293 ("scsi: core: Fix error handling of scsi_host_alloc()")
    changed the allocation logic to call put_device() to perform host cleanup
    with the assumption that IDA removal and stopping the kthread would
    properly be performed in scsi_host_dev_release(). However, in the unlikely
    case that the error handler thread fails to spawn, shost->ehandler is set
    to ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM).
    
    The error handler cleanup code in scsi_host_dev_release() will call
    kthread_stop() if shost->ehandler != NULL which will always be the case
    whether the kthread was successfully spawned or not. In the case that it
    failed to spawn this has the nasty side effect of trying to dereference an
    invalid pointer when kthread_stop() is called. The following splat provides
    an example of this behavior in the wild:
    
    scsi host11: error handler thread failed to spawn, error = -4

    KVM: SVM: remove INIT intercept handler
    
    commit 896707c212d440a6863ce0a3930c8a609e24497d upstream.
    
    Kernel never sends real INIT even to CPUs, other than on boot.
    
    Thus INIT interception is an error which should be caught
    by a check for an unknown VMexit reason.
    
    On top of that, the current INIT VM exit handler skips
    the current instruction which is wrong.
    That was added in commit 5ff3a351f687 ("KVM: x86: Move trivial
    instruction-based exit handlers to common code").

    exit handlers to common code"), unfortunately made a mistake of
    treating nop_on_interception and nop_interception in the same way.
    
    Former does truly nothing while the latter skips the instruction.
    
    SMI VM exit handler should do nothing.
    (SMI itself is handled by the host when we do STGI)

    KVM: X86: Disable hardware breakpoints unconditionally before kvm_x86->run()
    
    commit f85d40160691881a17a397c448d799dfc90987ba upstream.
    
    When the host is using debug registers but the guest is not using them
    nor is the guest in guest-debug state, the kvm code does not reset
    the host debug registers before kvm_x86->run().  Rather, it relies on
    the hardware vmentry instruction to automatically reset the dr7 registers
    which ensures that the host breakpoints do not affect the guest.
    
    This however violates the non-instrumentable nature around VM entry
    and exit; for example, when a host breakpoint is set on vcpu->arch.cr2,
    
    Another issue is consistency.  When the guest debug registers are active,
    the host breakpoints are reset before kvm_x86->run(). But when the
    guest debug registers are inactive, the host breakpoints are delayed to
    be disabled.  The host tracing tools may see different results depending
    on what the guest is doing.
    
    To fix the problems, we clear %db7 unconditionally before kvm_x86->run()
    if the host has set any breakpoints, no matter if the guest is using
    them or not.

    KVM: SVM: Revert clearing of C-bit on GPA in #NPF handler
    
    commit 76ff371b67cb12fb635396234468abcf6a466f16 upstream.
    
    Don't clear the C-bit in the #NPF handler, as it is a legal GPA bit for
    non-SEV guests, and for SEV guests the C-bit is dropped before the GPA
    hits the NPT in hardware.  Clearing the bit for non-SEV guests causes KVM
    to mishandle #NPFs with that collide with the host's C-bit.
    
    Although the APM doesn't explicitly state that the C-bit is not reserved
    for non-SEV, Tom Lendacky confirmed that the following snippet about the
    effective reduction due to the C-bit does indeed apply only to SEV guests.
    
      Note that because guest physical addresses are always translated
      through the nested page tables, the size of the guest physical address
      space is not impacted by any physical address space reduction indicated
      in CPUID 8000_001F[EBX]. If the C-bit is a physical address bit however,
      the guest physical address space is effectively reduced by 1 bit.
    
    And for SEV guests, the APM clearly states that the bit is dropped before
    walking the nested page tables.
    
      If the C-bit is an address bit, this bit is masked from the guest
      physical address when it is translated through the nested page tables.
      Consequently, the hypervisor does not need to be aware of which pages
      the guest has chosen to mark private.
    
    Note, the bogus C-bit clearing was removed from legacy #PF handler in
    commit 6d1b867d0456 ("KVM: SVM: Don't strip the C-bit from CR2 on #PF
    interception").

    KVM: x86/mmu: Do not apply HPA (memory encryption) mask to GPAs
    
    commit fc9bf2e087efcd81bda2e52d09616d2a1bf982a8 upstream.
    
    Ignore "dynamic" host adjustments to the physical address mask when
    generating the masks for guest PTEs, i.e. the guest PA masks.  The host
    physical address space and guest physical address space are two different
    beasts, e.g. even though SEV's C-bit is the same bit location for both
    host and guest, disabling SME in the host (which clears shadow_me_mask)
    does not affect the guest PTE->GPA "translation".
    
    For non-SEV guests, not dropping bits is the correct behavior.  Assuming
    KVM and userspace correctly enumerate/configure guest MAXPHYADDR, bits
    that are lost as collateral damage from memory encryption are treated as
    reserved bits, i.e. KVM will never get to the point where it attempts to
    generate a gfn using the affected bits.  And if userspace wants to create
    a bogus vCPU, then userspace gets to deal with the fallout of hardware
    doing odd things with bad GPAs.
    
    For SEV guests, not dropping the C-bit is technically wrong, but it's a
    moot point because KVM can't read SEV guest's page tables in any case
    since they're always encrypted.  Not to mention that the current KVM code
    is also broken since sme_me_mask does not have to be non-zero for SEV to
    be supported by KVM.  The proper fix would be to teach all of KVM to
    correctly handle guest private memory, but that's a task for the future.

    KVM: x86: Use kernel's x86_phys_bits to handle reduced MAXPHYADDR
    
    commit e39f00f60ebd2e7b295c37a05e6349df656d3eb8 upstream.
    
    Use boot_cpu_data.x86_phys_bits instead of the raw CPUID information to
    enumerate the MAXPHYADDR for KVM guests when TDP is disabled (the guest
    version is only relevant to NPT/TDP).
    
    When using shadow paging, any reductions to the host's MAXPHYADDR apply
    to KVM and its guests as well, i.e. using the raw CPUID info will cause
    KVM to misreport the number of PA bits available to the guest.
    
    Unconditionally zero out the "Physical Address bit reduction" entry.
    For !TDP, the adjustment is already done, and for TDP enumerating the
    host's reduction is wrong as the reduction does not apply to GPAs.

    cifs: use the expiry output of dns_query to schedule next resolution
    
    commit 506c1da44fee32ba1d3a70413289ad58c772bba6 upstream.
    
    We recently fixed DNS resolution of the server hostname during reconnect.
    However, server IP address may change, even when the old one continues
    to server (although sub-optimally).
    
    We should schedule the next DNS resolution based on the TTL of
    the DNS record used for the last resolution. This way, we resolve the
    server hostname again when a DNS record expires.
