    ALSA: hda - Enforces runtime_resume after S3 and S4 for each codec
    
    commit b5a236c175b0d984552a5f7c9d35141024c2b261 upstream.
    
    Recently we found the audio jack detection stop working after suspend
    on many machines with Realtek codec. Sometimes the audio selection
    dialogue didn't show up after users plugged headhphone/headset into
    the headset jack, sometimes after uses plugged headphone/headset, then
    click the sound icon on the upper-right corner of gnome-desktop, it
    also showed the speaker rather than the headphone.
    
    The root cause is that before suspend, the codec already call the
    runtime_suspend since this codec is not used by any apps, then in
    resume, it will not call runtime_resume for this codec. But for some
    realtek codec (so far, alc236, alc255 and alc891) with the specific
    BIOS, if it doesn't run runtime_resume after suspend, all codec
    functions including jack detection stop working anymore.
    
    This problem existed for a long time, but it was not exposed, that is
    because when problem happens, if users play sound or open
    sound-setting to check audio device, this will trigger calling to
    runtime_resume (via snd_hda_power_up), then the codec starts working
    again before users notice this problem.
    
    Since we don't know how many codec and BIOS combinations have this
    problem, to fix it, let the driver call runtime_resume for all codecs
    in pm_resume, maybe for some codecs, this is not needed, but it is
    harmless. After a codec is runtime resumed, if it is not used by any
    apps, it will be runtime suspended soon and furthermore we don't run
    suspend frequently, this change will not add much power consumption.

    ALSA: hda - Record the current power state before suspend/resume calls
    
    commit 98081ca62cbac31fb0f7efaf90b2e7384ce22257 upstream.
    
    Currently we deal with single codec and suspend codec callbacks for
    all S3, S4 and runtime PM handling.  But it turned out that we want
    distinguish the call patterns sometimes, e.g. for applying some init
    sequence only at probing and restoring from hibernate.
    
    This patch slightly modifies the common PM callbacks for HD-audio
    codec and stores the currently processed PM event in power_state of
    the codec's device.power field, which is currently unused.  The codec
    callback can take a look at this event value and judges which purpose
    it's being called.

    locking/lockdep: Add debug_locks check in __lock_downgrade()
    
    commit 71492580571467fb7177aade19c18ce7486267f5 upstream.
    
    Tetsuo Handa had reported he saw an incorrect "downgrading a read lock"
    warning right after a previous lockdep warning. It is likely that the
    previous warning turned off lock debugging causing the lockdep to have
    inconsistency states leading to the lock downgrade warning.
    
    Fix that by add a check for debug_locks at the beginning of
    __lock_downgrade().

    x86/unwind: Add hardcoded ORC entry for NULL
    
    commit ac5ceccce5501e43d217c596e4ee859f2a3fef79 upstream.
    
    When the ORC unwinder is invoked for an oops caused by IP==0,
    it currently has no idea what to do because there is no debug information
    for the stack frame of NULL.
    
    But if RIP is NULL, it is very likely that the last successfully executed
    instruction was an indirect CALL/JMP, and it is possible to unwind out in
    the same way as for the first instruction of a normal function. Hardcode
    a corresponding ORC entry.
    
    With an artificially-added NULL call in prctl_set_seccomp(), before this
    patch, the trace is:
    
    Call Trace:
     ? __x64_sys_prctl+0x402/0x680
     ? __ia32_sys_prctl+0x6e0/0x6e0
     ? __do_page_fault+0x457/0x620
     ? do_syscall_64+0x6d/0x160
     ? entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9
    
    After this patch, the trace looks like this:
    
    Call Trace:
     __x64_sys_prctl+0x402/0x680
     ? __ia32_sys_prctl+0x6e0/0x6e0

     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9
    
    prctl_set_seccomp() still doesn't show up in the trace because for some
    reason, tail call optimization is only disabled in builds that use the
    frame pointer unwinder.

    x86/unwind: Handle NULL pointer calls better in frame unwinder
    
    commit f4f34e1b82eb4219d8eaa1c7e2e17ca219a6a2b5 upstream.
    
    When the frame unwinder is invoked for an oops caused by a call to NULL, it
    currently skips the parent function because BP still points to the parent's
    stack frame; the (nonexistent) current function only has the first half of
    a stack frame, and BP doesn't point to it yet.
    
    Add a special case for IP==0 that calculates a fake BP from SP, then uses
    the real BP for the next frame.
    
    Note that this handles first_frame specially: Return information about the
    parent function as long as the saved IP is >=first_frame, even if the fake
    BP points below it.
    
    With an artificially-added NULL call in prctl_set_seccomp(), before this
    patch, the trace is:
    
    Call Trace:

    loop: access lo_backing_file only when the loop device is Lo_bound
    
    commit f7c8a4120eedf24c36090b7542b179ff7a649219 upstream.
    
    Commit 758a58d0bc67 ("loop: set GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN after
    blkdev_reread_part()") separates "lo->lo_backing_file = NULL" and
    "lo->lo_state = Lo_unbound" into different critical regions protected by
    loop_ctl_mutex.
    
    However, there is below race that the NULL lo->lo_backing_file would be
    accessed when the backend of a loop is another loop device, e.g., loop0's
    backend is a file, while loop1's backend is loop0.
    
    loop0's backend is file            loop1's backend is loop0
    
    __loop_clr_fd()
      mutex_lock(&loop_ctl_mutex);
      lo->lo_backing_file = NULL; --> set to NULL
      mutex_unlock(&loop_ctl_mutex);
                                       loop_set_fd()
                                         mutex_lock_killable(&loop_ctl_mutex);
                                         loop_validate_file()
                                           f = l->lo_backing_file; --> NULL
                                             access if loop0 is not Lo_unbound
      mutex_lock(&loop_ctl_mutex);
      lo->lo_state = Lo_unbound;
      mutex_unlock(&loop_ctl_mutex);
    
    lo->lo_backing_file should be accessed only when the loop device is
    Lo_bound.
    
    In fact, the problem has been introduced already in commit 7ccd0791d985
    ("loop: Push loop_ctl_mutex down into loop_clr_fd()") after which
    loop_validate_file() could see devices in Lo_rundown state with which it
    did not count. It was harmless at that point but still.

    aio: simplify - and fix - fget/fput for io_submit()
    
    commit 84c4e1f89fefe70554da0ab33be72c9be7994379 upstream.
    
    Al Viro root-caused a race where the IOCB_CMD_POLL handling of
    fget/fput() could cause us to access the file pointer after it had
    already been freed:
    
     "In more details - normally IOCB_CMD_POLL handling looks so:
    
       1) io_submit(2) allocates aio_kiocb instance and passes it to
          aio_poll()
    
       2) aio_poll() resolves the descriptor to struct file by req->file =
          fget(iocb->aio_fildes)
    
       3) aio_poll() sets ->woken to false and raises ->ki_refcnt of that
          aio_kiocb to 2 (bumps by 1, that is).
    
       4) aio_poll() calls vfs_poll(). After sanity checks (basically,
          "poll_wait() had been called and only once") it locks the queue.
          That's what the extra reference to iocb had been for - we know we
          can safely access it.
    
       5) With queue locked, we check if ->woken has already been set to
          true (by aio_poll_wake()) and, if it had been, we unlock the
          queue, drop a reference to aio_kiocb and bugger off - at that
          point it's a responsibility to aio_poll_wake() and the stuff
          called/scheduled by it. That code will drop the reference to file
          in req->file, along with the other reference to our aio_kiocb.
    
       6) otherwise, we see whether we need to wait. If we do, we unlock the
          queue, drop one reference to aio_kiocb and go away - eventual
          wakeup (or cancel) will deal with the reference to file and with
          the other reference to aio_kiocb
    
       7) otherwise we remove ourselves from waitqueue (still under the
          queue lock), so that wakeup won't get us. No async activity will
          be happening, so we can safely drop req->file and iocb ourselves.
    
      If wakeup happens while we are in vfs_poll(), we are fine - aio_kiocb
      won't get freed under us, so we can do all the checks and locking
      safely. And we don't touch ->file if we detect that case.
    
      However, vfs_poll() most certainly *does* touch the file it had been
      given. So wakeup coming while we are still in ->poll() might end up
      doing fput() on that file. That case is not too rare, and usually we
      are saved by the still present reference from descriptor table - that
      fput() is not the final one.
    
      But if another thread closes that descriptor right after our fget()
      and wakeup does happen before ->poll() returns, we are in trouble -
      final fput() done while we are in the middle of a method:
    
    Al also wrote a patch to take an extra reference to the file descriptor
    to fix this, but I instead suggested we just streamline the whole file
    pointer handling by submit_io() so that the generic aio submission code
    simply keeps the file pointer around until the aio has completed.

    RDMA/cma: Rollback source IP address if failing to acquire device
    
    commit 5fc01fb846bce8fa6d5f95e2625b8ce0f8e86810 upstream.
    
    If cma_acquire_dev_by_src_ip() returns error in addr_handler(), the
    device state changes back to RDMA_CM_ADDR_BOUND but the resolved source
    IP address is still left. After that, if rdma_destroy_id() is called
    after rdma_listen(), the device is freed without removed from
    listen_any_list in cma_cancel_operation(). Revert to the previous IP
    address if acquiring device fails.

    drm/vkms: Fix flush_work() without INIT_WORK().
    
    commit b30b61ff6b1dc37f276cf56a8328b80086a3ffca upstream.
    
    syzbot is hitting a lockdep warning [1] because flush_work() is called
    without INIT_WORK() after kzalloc() at vkms_atomic_crtc_reset().
    
    Commit 6c234fe37c57627a ("drm/vkms: Implement CRC debugfs API") added
    INIT_WORK() to only vkms_atomic_crtc_duplicate_state() side. Assuming
    that lifecycle of crc_work is appropriately managed, fix this problem
    by adding INIT_WORK() to vkms_atomic_crtc_reset() side.

    Bluetooth: hci_ldisc: Postpone HCI_UART_PROTO_READY bit set in hci_uart_set_proto()
    
    commit 56897b217a1d0a91c9920cb418d6b3fe922f590a upstream.
    
    task A:                                task B:
    hci_uart_set_proto                     flush_to_ldisc

                                               - test_bit HCI_UART_PROTO_READY
                                                - h5_recv

     - p->open(hu) -> h5_close //free h5

                                                  }
    
    It could use ioctl to set hci uart proto, but there is
    a use-after-free issue when hci_uart_register_dev() fail in
    hci_uart_set_proto(), see stack above, fix this by setting
    HCI_UART_PROTO_READY bit only when hci_uart_register_dev()
    return success.

    Bluetooth: hci_ldisc: Initialize hci_dev before open()
    
    commit 32a7b4cbe93b0a0ef7e63d31ca69ce54736c4412 upstream.
    
    The hci_dev struct hdev is referenced in work queues and timers started
    by open() in some protocols. This creates a race between the
    initialization function and the work or timer which can result hdev
    being dereferenced while it is still null.
    
    The syzbot report contains a reliable reproducer which causes a null
    pointer dereference of hdev in hci_uart_write_work() by making the
    memory allocation for hdev fail.
    
    To fix this, ensure hdev is valid from before calling a protocol's
    open() until after calling a protocol's close().

    Bluetooth: Fix decrementing reference count twice in releasing socket
    
    commit e20a2e9c42c9e4002d9e338d74e7819e88d77162 upstream.
    
    When releasing socket, it is possible to enter hci_sock_release() and
    hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG) at the same time in different thread.
    The reference count of hdev should be decremented only once from one of
    them but if storing hdev to local variable in hci_sock_release() before
    detached from socket and setting to NULL in hci_sock_dev_event(),
    hci_dev_put(hdev) is unexpectedly called twice. This is resolved by
    referencing hdev from socket after bt_sock_unlink() in
    hci_sock_release().

    commit 1dc2d785156cbdc80806c32e8d2c7c735d0b4721 upstream.
    
    h4_recv_buf() callers store the return value to socket buffer and
    recursively pass the buffer to h4_recv_buf() without protection. So,
    ERR_PTR returned from h4_recv_buf() can be dereferenced, if called again
    before setting the socket buffer to NULL from previous error. Check if
    skb is ERR_PTR in h4_recv_buf().

    ext4: brelse all indirect buffer in ext4_ind_remove_space()
    
    commit 674a2b27234d1b7afcb0a9162e81b2e53aeef217 upstream.
    
    All indirect buffers get by ext4_find_shared() should be released no
    mater the branch should be freed or not. But now, we forget to release
    the lower depth indirect buffers when removing space from the same
    higher depth indirect block. It will lead to buffer leak and futher
    more, it may lead to quota information corruption when using old quota,
    consider the following case.
    
     - Create and mount an empty ext4 filesystem without extent and quota
       features,
     - quotacheck and enable the user & group quota,
     - Create some files and write some data to them, and then punch hole
       to some files of them, it may trigger the buffer leak problem
       mentioned above.
     - Disable quota and run quotacheck again, it will create two new
       aquota files and write the checked quota information to them, which
       probably may reuse the freed indirect block(the buffer and page
       cache was not freed) as data block.
     - Enable quota again, it will invoke
       vfs_load_quota_inode()->invalidate_bdev() to try to clean unused
       buffers and pagecache. Unfortunately, because of the buffer of quota
       data block is still referenced, quota code cannot read the up to date
       quota info from the device and lead to quota information corruption.
    
    This problem can be reproduced by xfstests generic/231 on ext3 file
    system or ext4 file system without extent and quota features.
    
    This patch fix this problem by releasing the missing indirect buffers,
    in ext4_ind_remove_space().

    ext4: fix data corruption caused by unaligned direct AIO
    
    commit 372a03e01853f860560eade508794dd274e9b390 upstream.
    
    Ext4 needs to serialize unaligned direct AIO because the zeroing of
    partial blocks of two competing unaligned AIOs can result in data
    corruption.
    
    However it decides not to serialize if the potentially unaligned aio is
    past i_size with the rationale that no pending writes are possible past
    i_size. Unfortunately if the i_size is not block aligned and the second
    unaligned write lands past i_size, but still into the same block, it has
    the potential of corrupting the previous unaligned write to the same
    block.
    
    This is (very simplified) reproducer from Frank
    
        // 41472 = (10 * 4096) + 512
        // 37376 = 41472 - 4096

    Without this patch the 512B range from 40960 up to the start of the
    second unaligned write (41472) is going to be zeroed overwriting the data
    written by the first write. This is a data corruption.

    ext4: fix NULL pointer dereference while journal is aborted

    ALSA: hda - Don't trigger jackpoll_work in azx_resume
    
    commit 744c67ffeb06f2d2493f4049ba0bd19698ce0adf upstream.
    
    The commit 3baffc4a84d7 (ALSA: hda/intel: Refactoring PM code) changed
    the behaviour of azx_resume(), it triggers the jackpoll_work after
    applying this commit.
    
    This change introduced a new issue, all codecs are runtime active
    after S3, and will not call runtime_suspend() automatically.
    
    The root cause is the jackpoll_work calls snd_hda_power_up/down_pm,
    and it calls up_pm before snd_hdac_enter_pm is called, while calls
    the down_pm in the middle of enter_pm and leave_pm is called. This
    makes the dev->power.usage_count unbalanced after S3.
    
    To fix it, let azx_resume() don't trigger jackpoll_work as before
    it did.

    SMB3: Fix SMB3.1.1 guest mounts to Samba
    
    commit 8c11a607d1d9cd6e7f01fd6b03923597fb0ef95a upstream.
    
    Workaround problem with Samba responses to SMB3.1.1
    null user (guest) mounts.  The server doesn't set the
    expected flag in the session setup response so we have
    to do a similar check to what is done in smb3_validate_negotiate
    where we also check if the user is a null user (but not sec=krb5
    since username might not be passed in on mount for Kerberos case).
    
    Note that the commit below tightened the conditions and forced signing
    for the SMB2-TreeConnect commands as per MS-SMB2.
    However, this should only apply to normal user sessions and not for
    cases where there is no user (even if server forgets to set the flag
    in the response) since we don't have anything useful to sign with.
    This is especially important now that the more secure SMB3.1.1 protocol
    is in the default dialect list.
    
    An earlier patch ("cifs: allow guest mounts to work for smb3.11") fixed
    the guest mounts to Windows.
    
        Fixes: 6188f28bf608 ("Tree connect for SMB3.1.1 must be signed for non-encrypted shares")

    futex: Ensure that futex address is aligned in handle_futex_death()
    
    commit 5a07168d8d89b00fe1760120714378175b3ef992 upstream.
    
    The futex code requires that the user space addresses of futexes are 32bit
    aligned. sys_futex() checks this in futex_get_keys() but the robust list
    code has no alignment check in place.
    
    As a consequence the kernel crashes on architectures with strict alignment
    requirements in handle_futex_death() when trying to cmpxchg() on an
    unaligned futex address which was retrieved from the robust list.

    scsi: ibmvscsi: Fix empty event pool access during host removal
    
    commit 7f5203c13ba8a7b7f9f6ecfe5a4d5567188d7835 upstream.
    
    The event pool used for queueing commands is destroyed fairly early in the
    ibmvscsi_remove() code path. Since, this happens prior to the call so
    scsi_remove_host() it is possible for further calls to queuecommand to be
    processed which manifest as a panic due to a NULL pointer dereference as
    seen here:

    The kernel buffer log is overfilled with this log:
    
    [11261.952732] ibmvscsi: found no event struct in pool!
    
    This patch reorders the operations during host teardown. Start by calling
    the SRP transport and Scsi_Host remove functions to flush any outstanding
    work and set the host offline. LLDD teardown follows including destruction
    of the event pool, freeing the Command Response Queue (CRQ), and unmapping
    any persistent buffers. The event pool destruction is protected by the
    scsi_host lock, and the pool is purged prior of any requests for which we
    never received a response. Finally, move the removal of the scsi host from
    our global list to the end so that the host is easily locatable for
    debugging purposes during teardown.

    For each ibmvscsi host created during a probe or destroyed during a remove
    we either add or remove that host to/from the global ibmvscsi_head
    list. This runs the risk of concurrent modification.

    commit 4705f10e82c63924bd84a9b31d15839ec9ba3d06 upstream.
    
    Commit 7f147f9bfd44 ("scsi: qla2xxx: Fix N2N target discovery with Local
    loop") fixed N2N target discovery for local loop.  However, same code is
    used for FC-AL discovery as well. Added check to make sure we are bypassing
    area and domain check only in N2N topology for target discovery.

    scsi: core: Avoid that a kernel warning appears during system resume
    
    commit 17605afaae825b0291f80c62a7f6565879edaa8a upstream.
    
    Since scsi_device_quiesce() skips SCSI devices that have another state than
    RUNNING, OFFLINE or TRANSPORT_OFFLINE, scsi_device_resume() should not
    complain about SCSI devices that have been skipped. Hence this patch.  This
    patch avoids that the following warning appears during resume:

    powerpc/security: Fix spectre_v2 reporting
    
    commit 92edf8df0ff2ae86cc632eeca0e651fd8431d40d upstream.
    
    When I updated the spectre_v2 reporting to handle software count cache
    flush I got the logic wrong when there's no software count cache
    enabled at all.
    
    The result is that on systems with the software count cache flush
    disabled we print:
    
      Mitigation: Indirect branch cache disabled, Software count cache flush
    
    Which correctly indicates that the count cache is disabled, but
    incorrectly says the software count cache flush is enabled.
    
    The root of the problem is that we are trying to handle all
    combinations of options. But we know now that we only expect to see
    the software count cache flush enabled if the other options are false.
    
    So split the two cases, which simplifies the logic and fixes the bug.
    We were also missing a space before "(hardware accelerated)".
    
    The result is we see one of:
    
      Mitigation: Indirect branch serialisation (kernel only)
      Mitigation: Indirect branch cache disabled
      Mitigation: Software count cache flush
      Mitigation: Software count cache flush (hardware accelerated)

    powerpc/vdso64: Fix CLOCK_MONOTONIC inconsistencies across Y2038
    
    commit b5b4453e7912f056da1ca7572574cada32ecb60c upstream.
    
    Jakub Drnec reported:
      Setting the realtime clock can sometimes make the monotonic clock go
      back by over a hundred years. Decreasing the realtime clock across
      the y2k38 threshold is one reliable way to reproduce. Allegedly this
      can also happen just by running ntpd, I have not managed to
      reproduce that other than booting with rtc at >2038 and then running
      ntp. When this happens, anything with timers (e.g. openjdk) breaks
      rather badly.
    
    And included a test case (slightly edited for brevity):
      #define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 199309L
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <time.h>
      #include <stdlib.h>
      #include <unistd.h>
    
      long get_time(void) {
        struct timespec tp;
        clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tp);
        return tp.tv_sec + tp.tv_nsec / 1000000000;
      }
    
      int main(void) {
        long last = get_time();
        while(1) {
          long now = get_time();
          if (now < last) {
            printf("clock went backwards by %ld seconds!\n", last - now);
          }
          last = now;
          sleep(1);
        }
        return 0;
      }
    
    Which when run concurrently with:
     # date -s 2040-1-1
     # date -s 2037-1-1
    
    Will detect the clock going backward.
    
    The root cause is that wtom_clock_sec in struct vdso_data is only a
    32-bit signed value, even though we set its value to be equal to
    tk->wall_to_monotonic.tv_sec which is 64-bits.
    
    Because the monotonic clock starts at zero when the system boots the
    wall_to_montonic.tv_sec offset is negative for current and future
    dates. Currently on a freshly booted system the offset will be in the
    vicinity of negative 1.5 billion seconds.
    
    However if the wall clock is set past the Y2038 boundary, the offset
    from wall to monotonic becomes less than negative 2^31, and no longer
    fits in 32-bits. When that value is assigned to wtom_clock_sec it is
    truncated and becomes positive, causing the VDSO assembly code to
    calculate CLOCK_MONOTONIC incorrectly.
    
    That causes CLOCK_MONOTONIC to jump ahead by ~4 billion seconds which
    it is not meant to do. Worse, if the time is then set back before the
    Y2038 boundary CLOCK_MONOTONIC will jump backward.
    
    We can fix it simply by storing the full 64-bit offset in the
    vdso_data, and using that in the VDSO assembly code. We also shuffle
    some of the fields in vdso_data to avoid creating a hole.
    
    The original commit that added the CLOCK_MONOTONIC support to the VDSO
    did actually use a 64-bit value for wtom_clock_sec, see commit
    a7f290dad32e ("[PATCH] powerpc: Merge vdso's and add vdso support to
    32 bits kernel") (Nov 2005). However just 3 days later it was
    converted to 32-bits in commit 0c37ec2aa88b ("[PATCH] powerpc: vdso
    fixes (take #2)"), and the bug has existed since then AFAICS.
    
    Fixes: 0c37ec2aa88b ("[PATCH] powerpc: vdso fixes (take #2)")

    MIPS: Ensure ELF appended dtb is relocated
    
    commit 3f0a53bc6482fb09770982a8447981260ea258dc upstream.
    
    This fixes booting with the combination of CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y
    and CONFIG_MIPS_ELF_APPENDED_DTB=y.
    
    Sections that appear after the relocation table are not relocated
    on system boot (except .bss, which has special handling).
    
    With CONFIG_MIPS_ELF_APPENDED_DTB, the dtb is part of the
    vmlinux ELF, so it must be relocated together with everything else.

    mips: loongson64: lemote-2f: Add IRQF_NO_SUSPEND to "cascade" irqaction.
    
    commit 5f5f67da9781770df0403269bc57d7aae608fecd upstream.
    
    Timekeeping IRQs from CS5536 MFGPT are routed to i8259, which then
    triggers the "cascade" IRQ on MIPS CPU. Without IRQF_NO_SUSPEND in
    cascade_irqaction, MFGPT interrupts will be masked in suspend mode,
    and the machine would be unable to resume once suspended.
    
    Previously, MIPS IRQs were not disabled properly, so the original
    code appeared to work. Commit a3e6c1eff5 ("MIPS: IRQ: Fix disable_irq on
    CPU IRQs") uncovers the bug. To fix it, add IRQF_NO_SUSPEND to
    cascade_irqaction.
    
    This commit is functionally identical to 0add9c2f1cff ("MIPS:
    Loongson-3: Add IRQF_NO_SUSPEND to Cascade irqaction"), but it forgot
    to apply the same fix to Loongson2.

    libceph: wait for latest osdmap in ceph_monc_blacklist_add()
    
    commit bb229bbb3bf63d23128e851a1f3b85c083178fa1 upstream.
    
    Because map updates are distributed lazily, an OSD may not know about
    the new blacklist for quite some time after "osd blacklist add" command
    is completed.  This makes it possible for a blacklisted but still alive
    client to overwrite a post-blacklist update, resulting in data
    corruption.
    
    Waiting for latest osdmap in ceph_monc_blacklist_add() and thus using
    the post-blacklist epoch for all post-blacklist requests ensures that
    all such requests "wait" for the blacklist to come into force on their
    respective OSDs.

    Take into account that sg->offset can be bigger than PAGE_SIZE when
    setting segment sg->dma_address. Otherwise sg->dma_address will point
    at diffrent page, what makes DMA not possible with erros like this:

    Additinally with wrong sg->dma_address unmap_sg will free wrong pages,
    what what can cause crashes like this:

    drm/vmwgfx: Don't double-free the mode stored in par->set_mode
    
    commit c2d311553855395764e2e5bf401d987ba65c2056 upstream.
    
    When calling vmw_fb_set_par(), the mode stored in par->set_mode gets free'd
    twice. The first free is in vmw_fb_kms_detach(), the second is near the
    end of vmw_fb_set_par() under the name of 'old_mode'. The mode-setting code
    only works correctly if the mode doesn't actually change. Removing
    'old_mode' in favor of using par->set_mode directly fixes the problem.

    mmc: alcor: fix DMA reads
    
    commit 5ea47691bd99e1100707ec63364aff72324e2af4 upstream.
    
    Setting max_blk_count to 1 here was causing the mmc block layer
    to always use the MMC_READ_SINGLE_BLOCK command here, which the
    driver does not DMA-accelerate.
    
    Drop the max_blk_ settings here. The mmc host defaults suffice,
    along with the max_segs and max_seg_size settings, which I have
    now documented in more detail.
    
    Now each MMC command reads 4 512-byte blocks, using DMA instead of
    PIO. On my SD card, this increases read performance (measured with dd)
    from 167kb/sec to 4.6mb/sec.

    mmc: pxamci: fix enum type confusion

            tx = dmaengine_prep_slave_sg(chan, data->sg, host->dma_len, direction,
    
    The behavior is correct, so this must be a simply typo from
    dma_data_direction and dma_transfer_direction being similarly named
    types with a similar purpose.

    ALSA: firewire-motu: use 'version' field of unit directory to identify model
    
    commit 2d012c65a9ca26a0ef87ea0a42f1653dd37155f5 upstream.
    
    Current ALSA firewire-motu driver uses the value of 'model' field
    of unit directory in configuration ROM for modalias for MOTU
    FireWire models. However, as long as I checked, Pre8 and
    828mk3(Hybrid) have the same value for the field (=0x100800).
    
    unit            | version   | model
    --------------- | --------- | ----------
    828mkII         | 0x000003  | 0x101800
    Traveler        | 0x000009  | 0x107800
    Pre8            | 0x00000f  | 0x100800 <-
    828mk3(FW)      | 0x000015  | 0x106800
    AudioExpress    | 0x000033  | 0x104800
    828mk3(Hybrid)  | 0x000035  | 0x100800 <-
    
    When updating firmware for MOTU 8pre FireWire from v1.0.0 to v1.0.3,
    I got change of the value from 0x100800 to 0x103800. On the other
    hand, the value of 'version' field is fixed to 0x00000f. As a quick
    glance, the higher 12 bits of the value of 'version' field represent
    firmware version, while the lower 12 bits is unknown.
    
    By induction, the value of 'version' field represents actual model.
    
    This commit changes modalias to match the value of 'version' field,
    instead of 'model' field. For degug, long name of added sound card
    includes hexadecimal value of 'model' field.
