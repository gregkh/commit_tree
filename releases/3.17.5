    netfilter: conntrack: fix race in __nf_conntrack_confirm against get_next_corpse
    
    commit 5195c14c8b27cc0b18220ddbf0e5ad3328a04187 upstream.
    
    After removal of the central spinlock nf_conntrack_lock, in
    commit 93bb0ceb75be2 ("netfilter: conntrack: remove central
    spinlock nf_conntrack_lock"), it is possible to race against
    get_next_corpse().
    
    The race is against the get_next_corpse() cleanup on
    the "unconfirmed" list (a per-cpu list with seperate locking),
    which set the DYING bit.
    
    Fix this race, in __nf_conntrack_confirm(), by removing the CT
    from unconfirmed list before checking the DYING bit.  In case
    race occured, re-add the CT to the dying list.
    
    While at this, fix coding style of the comment that has been
    updated.

    x86: kvm: use alternatives for VMCALL vs. VMMCALL if kernel text is read-only
    
    commit c1118b3602c2329671ad5ec8bdf8e374323d6343 upstream.
    
    On x86_64, kernel text mappings are mapped read-only with CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA.
    In that case, KVM will fail to patch VMCALL instructions to VMMCALL
    as required on AMD processors.
    
    The failure mode is currently a divide-by-zero exception, which obviously
    is a KVM bug that has to be fixed.  However, picking the right instruction
    between VMCALL and VMMCALL will be faster and will help if you cannot upgrade
    the hypervisor.

    drm/i915: Ignore long hpds on eDP ports
    
    original upstream id: 7a7f84ccb82e542c845c43f604665ccea1247866
    
    Turning vdd on/off can generate a long hpd pulse on eDP ports. In order
    to handle hpd we would need to turn on vdd to perform aux transfers.
    This would lead to an endless cycle of
    "vdd off -> long hpd -> vdd on -> detect -> vdd off -> ..."
    
    So ignore long hpd pulses on eDP ports. eDP panels should be physically
    tied to the machine anyway so they should not actually disappear and
    thus don't need long hpd handling. Short hpds are still needed for link
    re-train and whatnot so we can't just turn off the hpd interrupt
    entirely for eDP ports. Perhaps we could turn it off whenever the panel
    is disabled, but just ignoring the long hpd seems sufficient.

    Don't add the time event to the list. We added it several
    times the same time event, which leads to an infinite loop
    when walking the list.
    
    Since we (currently) don't support more than one ROC for STA
    vif at a time, enforce this and don't add the time event
    to any list.
    
    We were also missing the locking of the mutex which led to
    a lockdep splat - fix that.

    This is the same on some 64 bits architectures with GENMASK_ULL(63, 0).
    
    This is due to an overflow in the shift operand, 1 << 32 for GENMASK,
    1 << 64 for GENMASK_ULL.

    gpu/radeon: Set flag to indicate broken 64-bit MSI
    
    commit 91ed6fd2c383bb8f02d66e98b4a4d2f7207249dc upstream.
    
    Some radeon ASICs don't support all 64 address bits of MSIs despite
    advertising support for 64-bit MSIs in their configuration space.
    
    This breaks on systems such as IBM POWER7/8, where 64-bit MSIs can
    be assigned with some of the high address bits set.
    
    This makes use of the newly introduced "no_64bit_msi" flag in structure
    pci_dev to allow the MSI allocation code to fallback to 32-bit MSIs
    on those adapters.
    
    Adding Alex's review tag. Patch to the driver is identical to the
    reviewed one, I dropped the arch/powerpc hunk rewrote the subject
    and cset comment.

    drm/i915: Ignore SURFLIVE and flip counter when the GPU gets reset
    
    commit bdfa7542d40e6251c232a802231b37116bd31b11 upstream.
    
    During a GPU reset we need to get pending page flip cleared out
    since the ring contents are gone and flip will never complete
    on its own. This used to work until the mmio vs. CS flip race
    detection came about. That piece of code is looking for a
    specific surface address in the SURFLIVE register, but as
    a flip to that address may never happen the check may never
    pass. So we should just skip the SURFLIVE and flip counter
    checks when the GPU gets reset.
    
    intel_display_handle_reset() tries to effectively complete
    the flip anyway by calling .update_primary_plane(). But that
    may not satisfy the conditions of the mmio vs. CS race
    detection since there's no guarantee that a modeset didn't
    sneak in between the GPU reset and intel_display_handle_reset().
    Such a modeset will not wait for pending flips due to the ongoing GPU
    reset, and then the primary plane updates performed by
    intel_display_handle_reset() will already use the new surface
    address, and thus the surface address the flip is waiting for
    might never appear in SURFLIVE. The result is that the flip
    will never complete and attempts to perform further page flips
    will fail with -EBUSY.
    
    During the GPU reset intel_crtc_has_pending_flip() will return
    false regardless, so the deadlock with a modeset vs. the error
    work acquiring crtc->mutex was avoided. And the reset_counter
    check in intel_crtc_has_pending_flip() actually made this bug
    even less severe since it allowed normal modesets to go through
    even though there's a pending flip.
    
    This is a regression introduced by me here:

    clk-divider: Fix READ_ONLY when divider > 1
    
    commit e6d5e7d90be92cee626d7ec16ca9b06f1eed710b upstream.
    
    Commit 79c6ab509558 (clk: divider: add CLK_DIVIDER_READ_ONLY flag) in
    v3.16 introduced the CLK_DIVIDER_READ_ONLY flag which caused the
    recalc_rate() and round_rate() clock callbacks to be omitted.
    
    However using this flag has the unfortunate side effect of causing the
    clock recalculation code when a clock rate change is attempted to always
    treat it as a pass-through clock, i.e. with a fixed divide of 1, which
    may not be the case. Child clock rates are then recalculated using the
    wrong parent rate.
    
    Therefore instead of dropping the recalc_rate() and round_rate()
    callbacks, alter clk_divider_bestdiv() to always report the current
    divider as the best divider so that it is never altered.
    
    For me the read only clock was the system clock, which divided the PLL
    rate by 2, from which both the UART and the SPI clocks were divided.
    Initial setting of the UART rate set it correctly, but when the SPI
    clock was set, the other child clocks were miscalculated. The UART clock
    was recalculated using the PLL rate as the parent rate, resulting in a
    UART new_rate of double what it should be, and a UART which spewed forth
    garbage when the rate changes were propagated.

    bnx2fc: do not add shared skbs to the fcoe_rx_list
    
    commit 01a4cc4d0cd6a836c7b923760e8eb1cbb6a47258 upstream.
    
    In some cases, the fcoe_rx_list may contains multiple instances
    of the same skb (the so called "shared skbs").
    
    the bnx2fc_l2_rcv thread is a loop that extracts a skb from the list,
    modifies (and destroys) its content and then proceed to the next one.
    The problem is that if the skb is shared, the remaining instances will
    be corrupted.
    
    The solution is to use skb_share_check() before adding the skb to the
    fcoe_rx_list.

    irqchip: atmel-aic: Fix irqdomain initialization
    
    commit 45977fe35bf014f5cf9552717e1320783398ae0d upstream.
    
    First of all IRQCHIP_SKIP_SET_WAKE is not a valid irq_gc_flags and thus
    should not be passed as the last argument of
    irq_alloc_domain_generic_chips.
    
    Then pass the correct handler (handle_fasteoi_irq) to
    irq_alloc_domain_generic_chips instead of manually re-setting it in the
    initialization loop.
    
    And eventually initialize default irq flags to the pseudo standard:
    IRQ_REQUEST | IRQ_PROBE | IRQ_AUTOEN.

    The issue is that test_and_set_bit() done on adapter->state is being
    performed *after* the netdevice has been freed via free_netdev().
    
    When netdev is being allocated on initialization time, it allocates
    a private area, here struct ixgbe_adapter, that resides after the
    net_device structure. In ixgbe_probe(), the device init routine,
    we set up the adapter after alloc_etherdev_mq() on the private area
    and add a reference for the pci_dev as well via pci_set_drvdata().
    
    Both in the error path of ixgbe_probe(), but also on module unload
    when ixgbe_remove() is being called, commit 41c62843eb6a ("ixgbe:
    Fix rcu warnings induced by LER") accesses adapter after free_netdev().
    The patch stores the result in a bool and thus fixes above oops on my
    side.

    ixgbe: Correctly disable VLAN filter in promiscuous mode
    
    commit 4556dc591691fca743518edb24f15fbc83b5c8ef upstream.
    
    IXGBE adapter seems to require that VLAN filtering be enabled if
    VMDQ or SRIOV are enabled.  When those functions are disabled,
    VLAN filtering may be disabled in promiscuous mode.
    
    Prior to commit a9b8943ee129 ("ixgbe: remove vlan_filter_disable
    and enable functions")
    
    The logic was correct.  However, after the commit the logic
    got reversed and VLAN filtered in now turned on when VMDQ/SRIOV
    is disabled.
    
    This patch changes the condition to enable hw vlan filtered
    when VMDQ or SRIOV is enabled.

    net/ping: handle protocol mismatching scenario
    
    commit 91a0b603469069cdcce4d572b7525ffc9fd352a6 upstream.
    
    ping_lookup() may return a wrong sock if sk_buff's and sock's protocols
    dont' match. For example, sk_buff's protocol is ETH_P_IPV6, but sock's
    sk_family is AF_INET, in that case, if sk->sk_bound_dev_if is zero, a wrong
    sock will be returned.
    the fix is to "continue" the searching, if no matching, return NULL.

    hwmon: (g762) fix call to devm_hwmon_device_register_with_groups()
    
    commit 6b19b66013cfe608d63f0dab38834bbaceb0217a upstream.
    
    g762_remove() needs to first call hwmon_device_unregister() and then
    g762_of_clock_disable(). For that reason, it is not possible to
    convert it to devm_hwmon_device_register_with_groups() and the
    the non device managed version must be used.
    
    This is correctly stated in commit message for 398e16db6262 ("hwmon:
    (g762) Convert to hwmon_device_register_with_groups") but the
    associated changes do in fact introduce a call to the device managed
    version of the function.
    
    This patch fixes that typo by switching to the non devm_ version.

    sound/radeon: Move 64-bit MSI quirk from arch to driver
    
    commit db79afa1e57925ba96ab18514c0ebe42a28e393e upstream.
    
    A number of radeon cards have a HW limitation causing them to be
    unable to generate the full 64-bit of address bits for MSIs. This
    breaks MSIs on some platforms such as POWER machines.
    
    We used to have a powerpc specific quirk to address that on a
    single card, but this doesn't scale very well, this is better
    put under control of the drivers who know precisely what a given
    HW revision can do.
    
    We now have a generic quirk in the PCI code. We should set it
    appropriately for all radeon's from the audio driver.

    nfsd: Fix slot wake up race in the nfsv4.1 callback code
    
    commit c6c15e1ed303ffc47e696ea1c9a9df1761c1f603 upstream.
    
    The currect code for nfsd41_cb_get_slot() and nfsd4_cb_done() has no

    rt2x00: do not align payload on modern H/W
    
    commit cfd9167af14eb4ec21517a32911d460083ee3d59 upstream.
    
    RT2800 and newer hardware require padding between header and payload if
    header length is not multiple of 4.
    
    For historical reasons we also align payload to to 4 bytes boundary, but
    such alignment is not needed on modern H/W.
    
    Patch fixes skb_under_panic problems reported from time to time:
    
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84911
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=72471
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-wireless&m=139108549530402&w=2
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1087591
    
    Panic happened because we eat 4 bytes of skb headroom on each
    (re)transmission when sending frame without the payload and the header
    length not being multiple of 4 (i.e. QoS header has 26 bytes). On such
    case because paylad_aling=2 is bigger than header_align=0 we increase
    header_align by 4 bytes. To prevent that we could change the check to:
    
            if (payload_length && payload_align > header_align)
                    header_align += 4;
    
    but not aligning payload at all is more effective and alignment is not
    really needed by H/W (that has been tested on OpenWrt project for few
    years now).

    commit 1f9cd915b64bb95f7b41667b4bf8b22f0a0a557b upstream.
    
    The prep_memcpy call was not setting any meaningful burst and width because it
    was relying on the dma_slave_config was not set already.
    
    Rework the needed conversion functions, and hardcode the width and burst to

    vhost-scsi: Take configfs group dependency during VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT
    
    commit ab8edab132829b26dd13db6caca3c242cce35dc1 upstream.
    
    This patch addresses a bug where individual vhost-scsi configfs endpoint
    groups can be removed from below while active exports to QEMU userspace
    still exist, resulting in an OOPs.
    
    It adds a configfs_depend_item() in vhost_scsi_set_endpoint() to obtain
    an explicit dependency on se_tpg->tpg_group in order to prevent individual
    vhost-scsi WWPN endpoints from being released via normal configfs methods
    while an QEMU ioctl reference still exists.
    
    Also, add matching configfs_undepend_item() in vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint()
    to release the dependency, once QEMU's reference to the individual group
    at /sys/kernel/config/target/vhost/$WWPN/$TPGT is released.
    
    (Fix up vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint() error path - DanC)

    spi: Fix mapping from vmalloc-ed buffer to scatter list
    
    commit c1aefbdd050e1fb15e92bcaf34d95b17ea952097 upstream.
    
    We can only use page_address on memory that has been mapped using kmap,
    when the buffer passed to the SPI has been allocated by vmalloc the page
    has not necessarily been mapped through kmap. This means sometimes
    page_address will return NULL causing the pointer we pass to sg_set_buf
    to be invalid.
    
    As we only call page_address so that we can pass a virtual address to
    sg_set_buf which will then immediately call virt_to_page on it, fix this
    by calling sg_set_page directly rather then relying on the sg_set_buf
    helper.

    spi: dw: Fix dynamic speed change.
    
    commit 0a8727e69778683495058852f783eeda141a754e upstream.
    
    An IOCTL call that calls spi_setup() and then dw_spi_setup() will
    overwrite the persisted last transfer speed. On each transfer, the
    SPI speed is compared to the last transfer speed to determine if the
    clock divider registers need to be updated (did the speed change?).
    This bug was observed with the spidev driver using spi-config to
    update the max transfer speed.
    
    This fix: Don't overwrite the persisted last transaction clock speed
    when updating the SPI parameters in dw_spi_setup(). On the next
    transaction, the new speed won't match the persisted last speed
    and the hardware registers will be updated.
    On initialization, the persisted last transaction clock
    speed will be 0 but will be updated after the first SPI
    transaction.
    
    Move zeroed clock divider check into clock change test because
    chip->clk_div is zero on startup and would cause a divide-by-zero
    error. The calculation was wrong as well (can't support odd #).

    If an initiator sends a zero-length command (e.g. TEST UNIT READY) but
    sets the transfer direction in the transport layer to indicate a
    data-out phase, we still shouldn't try to transfer data.  At best it's
    a NOP, and depending on the transport, we might crash on an
    uninitialized sg list.

    Input: xpad - use proper endpoint type
    
    commit a1f9a4072655843fc03186acbad65990cc05dd2d upstream.
    
    The xpad wireless endpoint is not a bulk endpoint on my devices, but
    rather an interrupt one, so the USB core complains when it is submitted.
    I'm guessing that the author really did mean that this should be an
    interrupt urb, but as there are a zillion different xpad devices out
    there, let's cover out bases and handle both bulk and interrupt
    endpoints just as easily.

    commit 3f4aa45ceea5789a4aade536acc27f2e0d3da5e1 upstream.
    
    We cannot restart cacheflush safely if a process provides user-defined
    signal handler and signal is pending. In this case -EINTR is returned
    and it is expected that process re-invokes syscall. However, there are
    a few problems with that:
     * looks like nobody bothers checking return value from cacheflush
     * but if it did, we don't provide the restart address for that, so the
       process has to use the same range again
     * ...and again, what might lead to looping forever
    
    So, remove cacheflush restarting code and terminate cache flushing
    as early as fatal signal is pending.

    ARM: 8222/1: mvebu: enable strex backoff delay
    
    commit 995ab5189d1d7264e79e665dfa032a19b3ac646e upstream.
    
    Under extremely rare conditions, in an MPCore node consisting of at
    least 3 CPUs, two CPUs trying to perform a STREX to data on the same
    shared cache line can enter a livelock situation.
    
    This patch enables the HW mechanism that overcomes the bug. This fixes
    the incorrect setup of the STREX backoff delay bit due to a wrong
    description in the specification.
    
    Note that enabling the STREX backoff delay mechanism is done by
    leaving the bit *cleared*, while the bit was currently being set by
    the proc-v7.S code.
    
    [Thomas: adapt to latest mainline, slightly reword the commit log, add
    stable markers.]

    ARM: 8216/1: xscale: correct auxiliary register in suspend/resume
    
    commit ef59a20ba375aeb97b3150a118318884743452a8 upstream.
    
    According to the manuals I have, XScale auxiliary register should be
    reached with opc_2 = 1 instead of crn = 1. cpu_xscale_proc_init
    correctly uses c1, c0, 1 arguments, but cpu_xscale_do_suspend and
    cpu_xscale_do_resume use c1, c1, 0. Correct suspend/resume functions to
    also use c1, c0, 1.
    
    The issue was primarily noticed thanks to qemu reporing "unsupported
    instruction" on the pxa suspend path. Confirmed in PXA210/250 and PXA255
    XScale Core manuals and in PXA270 and PXA320 Developers Guides.
    
    Harware tested by me on tosa (pxa255). Robert confirmed on pxa270 board.

    of/selftest: Fix off-by-one error in removal path
    
    commit c1a2086e2d8c4eb4e8630ba752e911ec180dec67 upstream.
    
    The removal path for selftest data has an off by one error that causes
    the code to dereference beyond the end of the nodes[] array on the first
    pass through. The old code only worked by chance on a lot of platforms,
    but the bug was recently exposed on aarch64.
    
    The fix is simple. Decrement the node count before dereferencing, not
    after.

    of: Fix crash if an earlycon driver is not found
    
    commit ab74d00a39f70e1bc34a01322bb59f3750ca7a8c upstream.
    
    __earlycon_of_table_sentinel.compatible is a char[128], not a pointer, so
    it will never be NULL.  Checking it against NULL causes the match loop to
    run past the end of the array, and eventually match a bogus entry, under
    the following conditions:
    
     - Kernel command line specifies "earlycon" with no parameters
     - DT has a stdout-path pointing to a UART node
     - The UART driver doesn't use OF_EARLYCON_DECLARE (or maybe the console
       driver is compiled out)
    
    Fix this by checking to see if match->compatible is a non-empty string.

      - Software should prefer 'interrupts-extended'
      - Software that doesn't comprehend 'interrupts-extended' may use
        'interrupts'
    
    But there is still a paragraph at the end that prohibits having both and
    says 'interrupts' should be preferred.
    
    Remove the contradictory text.

    ACPI / PM: Ignore wakeup setting if the ACPI companion can't wake up
    
    commit 78579b7c7eb45f0e7ec5e9437087ed21749f9a9c upstream.
    
    As reported by Dmitry, on some Chromebooks there are devices with
    corresponding ACPI objects and with unusual system wakeup
    configuration.  Namely, they technically are wakeup-capable, but the
    wakeup is handled via a platform-specific out-of-band mechanism and
    the ACPI PM layer has no information on the wakeup capability.  As
    a result, device_may_wakeup(dev) called from acpi_dev_suspend_late()
    returns 'true' for those devices, but the wakeup.flags.valid flag is
    unset for the corresponding ACPI device objects, so acpi_device_wakeup()
    reproducibly fails for them causing acpi_dev_suspend_late() to return
    an error code.  The entire system suspend is then aborted and the
    machines in question cannot suspend at all.
    
    Address the problem by ignoring the device_may_wakeup(dev) return
    value in acpi_dev_suspend_late() if the ACPI companion of the device
    being handled has wakeup.flags.valid unset (in which case it is clear
    that the wakeup is supposed to be handled by other means).
    
    This fixes a regression introduced by commit a76e9bd89ae7 (i2c:
    attach/detach I2C client device to the ACPI power domain) as the
    affected systems could suspend and resume successfully before that
    commit.

    ACPI / EC: Add support to disallow QR_EC to be issued before completing previous QR_EC
    
    commit 558e4736f2e1b0e6323adf7a5e4df77ed6cfc1a4 upstream.
    
    There is platform refusing to respond QR_EC when SCI_EVT isn't set
    which is Acer Aspire V5-573G.
    
    By disallowing QR_EC to be issued before the previous one has been
    completed we are able to reduce the possibilities to trigger issues on
    such platforms.
    
    Note that this fix can only reduce the occurrence rate of this issue, but
    this issue may still occur when such a platform doesn't clear SCI_EVT
    before or immediately after completing the previous QR_EC transaction.
    This patch cannot fix the CLEAR_ON_RESUME quirk which also relies on
    the assumption that the platforms are able to respond even when SCI_EVT
    isn't set.
    
    But this patch is still useful as it can help to reduce the number of
    scheduled QR_EC work items.

    btrfs: fix lockups from btrfs_clear_path_blocking
    
    commit f82c458a2c3ffb94b431fc6ad791a79df1b3713e upstream.
    
    The fair reader/writer locks mean that btrfs_clear_path_blocking needs
    to strictly follow lock ordering rules even when we already have
    blocking locks on a given path.
    
    Before we can clear a blocking lock on the path, we need to make sure
    all of the locks have been converted to blocking.  This will remove lock
    inversions against anyone spinning in write_lock() against the buffers
    we're trying to get read locks on.  These inversions didn't exist before
    the fair read/writer locks, but now we need to be more careful.
    
    We papered over this deadlock in the past by changing
    btrfs_try_read_lock() to be a true trylock against both the spinlock and
    the blocking lock.  This was slower, and not sufficient to fix all the
    deadlocks.  This patch adds a btrfs_tree_read_lock_atomic(), which
    basically means get the spinlock but trylock on the blocking lock.

    aio: fix uncorrent dirty pages accouting when truncating AIO ring buffer
    
    commit 835f252c6debd204fcd607c79975089b1ecd3472 upstream.
    
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86831
    
    Markus reported that when shutting down mysqld (with AIO support,
    on a ext3 formatted Harddrive) leads to a negative number of dirty pages
    (underrun to the counter). The negative number results in a drastic reduction
    of the write performance because the page cache is not used, because the kernel
    thinks it is still 2 ^ 32 dirty pages open.
    
    Add a warn trace in __dec_zone_state will catch this easily:
    
    static inline void __dec_zone_state(struct zone *zone, enum
            zone_stat_item item)
    {
         atomic_long_dec(&zone->vm_stat[item]);
    +    WARN_ON_ONCE(item == NR_FILE_DIRTY &&
            atomic_long_read(&zone->vm_stat[item]) < 0);
         atomic_long_dec(&vm_stat[item]);
    }

    The cause is that we set the aio ring file pages as *DIRTY* via SetPageDirty
    (bypasses the VFS dirty pages increment) when init, and aio fs uses
    *default_backing_dev_info* as the backing dev, which does not disable
    the dirty pages accounting capability.
    So truncating aio ring file will contribute to accounting dirty pages (VFS
    dirty pages decrement), then error occurs.
    
    The original goal is keeping these pages in memory (can not be reclaimed
    or swapped) in life-time via marking it dirty. But thinking more, we have
    already pinned pages via elevating the page's refcount, which can already
    achieve the goal, so the SetPageDirty seems unnecessary.
    
    In order to fix the issue, using the __set_page_dirty_no_writeback instead
    of the nop .set_page_dirty, and dropped the SetPageDirty (don't manually
    set the dirty flags, don't disable set_page_dirty(), rely on default behaviour).
    
    With the above change, the dirty pages accounting can work well. But as we
    known, aio fs is an anonymous one, which should never cause any real write-back,
    we can ignore the dirty pages (write back) accounting by disabling the dirty
    pages (write back) accounting capability. So we introduce an aio private
    backing dev info (disabled the ACCT_DIRTY/WRITEBACK/ACCT_WB capabilities) to
    replace the default one.

    AMD/ATI HDMI controller chip models, we already have a filter to lower

    although the hardware doesn't really work with 63bit but only with 40
    or 48bit DMA.  In this patch, we take 40bit DMA for safety for the
    AMD/ATI controllers as the graphics drivers does.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Add ctrl message delay quirk for Marantz/Denon devices
    
    commit 6e84a8d7ac3ba246ef44e313e92bc16a1da1b04a upstream.
    
    This patch adds a USB control message delay quirk for a few specific Marantz/Denon
    devices. Without the delay the DACs will not work properly and produces the
    following type of messages:
    
    Nov 15 10:09:21 orwell kernel: [   91.342880] usb 3-13: clock source 41 is not valid, cannot use
    Nov 15 10:09:21 orwell kernel: [   91.343775] usb 3-13: clock source 41 is not valid, cannot use
    
    There are likely other Marantz/Denon devices using the same USB module which exhibit the
    same problems. But as this cannot be verified I limited the patch to the devices
    I could test.
    
    The following two devices are covered by this path:
    - Marantz SA-14S1
    - Marantz HD-DAC1

    usb: xhci: rework root port wake bits if controller isn't allowed to wakeup
    
    commit a1377e5397ab321e21b793ec8cd2b6f12bd3c718 upstream.
    
    When system is being suspended, if host device is not allowed to do wakeup,
    xhci_suspend() needs to clear all root port wake on bits. Otherwise, some
    platforms may generate spurious wakeup, even if PCI PME# is disabled.
    
    The initial commit ff8cbf250b44 ("xhci: clear root port wake on bits"),
    which also got into stable, turned out to not work correctly and had to
    be reverted, and is now rewritten.

    USB: xhci: Reset a halted endpoint immediately when we encounter a stall.
    
    commit 8e71a322fdb127814bcba423a512914ca5bc6cf5 upstream.
    
    If a device is halted and reuturns a STALL, then the halted endpoint
    needs to be cleared both on the host and device side. The host
    side halt is cleared by issueing a xhci reset endpoint command. The device side
    is cleared with a ClearFeature(ENDPOINT_HALT) request, which should
    be issued by the device driver if a URB reruen -EPIPE.
    
    Previously we cleared the host side halt after the device side was cleared.
    To make sure the host side halt is cleared in time we want to issue the
    reset endpoint command immedialtely when a STALL status is encountered.
    
    Otherwise we end up not following the specs and not returning -EPIPE
    several times in a row when trying to transfer data to a halted endpoint.

    USB: xhci: don't start a halted endpoint before its new dequeue is set
    
    commit c3492dbfa1050debf23a5b5cd2bc7514c5b37896 upstream.
    
    A halted endpoint ring must first be reset, then move the ring
    dequeue pointer past the problematic TRB. If we start the ring too
    early after reset, but before moving the dequeue pointer we
    will end up executing the same problematic TRB again.
    
    As we always issue a set transfer dequeue command after a reset
    endpoint command we can skip starting endpoint rings at reset endpoint
    command completion.
    
    Without this fix we end up trying to handle the same faulty TD for
    contol endpoints. causing timeout, and failing testusb ctrl_out write
    tests.

    powerpc/powernv: Fix the hmi event version check.
    
    commit 6acbc5a1dab30aa8f7be7bf3852f343f89147ac5 upstream.
    
    The current HMI event structure is an ABI and carries a version field to
    accommodate future changes without affecting/rearranging current structure
    members that are valid for previous versions.
    
    The current version check "if (hmi_evt->version != OpalHMIEvt_V1)"
    doesn't accomodate the fact that the version number may change in
    future.
    
    If firmware starts returning an HMI event with version > 1, this check
    will fail and no HMI information will be printed on older kernels.
    
    This patch fixes this issue.

    The root cause is that xmon is calling RTAS to turn off the surveillance

    powerpc/powernv: Replace OPAL_DEASSERT_RESET with EEH_RESET_DEACTIVATE
    
    commit 360d88a9e3fba596a12520b242fbab1c45b983e1 upstream.
    
    The flag passed to ioda_eeh_phb_reset() should be EEH_RESET_DEACTIVATE,
    which is translated to OPAL_DEASSERT_RESET or something else by the
    EEH backend accordingly.
    
    The patch replaces OPAL_DEASSERT_RESET with EEH_RESET_DEACTIVATE for

    of/base: Fix PowerPC address parsing hack
    
    commit 746c9e9f92dde2789908e51a354ba90a1962a2eb upstream.
    
    We have a historical hack that treats missing ranges properties as the
    equivalent of an empty one. This is needed for ancient PowerMac "bad"
    device-trees, and shouldn't be enabled for any other PowerPC platform,
    otherwise we get some nasty layout of devices in sysfs or even
    duplication when a set of otherwise identically named devices is
    created multiple times under a different parent node with no ranges
    property.
    
    This fix is needed for the PowerNV i2c busses to be exposed properly
    and will fix a number of other embedded cases.

    ath9k: Fix RTC_DERIVED_CLK usage
    
    commit 4e6ce4dc7ce71d0886908d55129d5d6482a27ff9 upstream.
    
    Based on the reference clock, which could be 25MHz or 40MHz,
    AR_RTC_DERIVED_CLK is programmed differently for AR9340 and AR9550.
    But, when a chip reset is done, processing the initvals
    sets the register back to the default value.
    
    Fix this by moving the code in ath9k_hw_init_pll() to
    ar9003_hw_override_ini(). Also, do this override for AR9531.

    commit 2cb1e0259f50c7be88eb277c7442fa74a3ce7c57 upstream.
    
    In commit a1253ef6d3fa ("ASoC: cs42l51: split i2c from codec driver"),
    the I2C part of the CS42L51 was moved to a separate file, but the
    definition of the of_device_id array was left in the driver file
    itself, no longer connected to the platform_driver structure using the
    .of_match_table pointer.
    
    This commit exports the of_device_id array in cs42l51, and uses it as
    .of_match_able in cs42l51-i2c.c. This solution was suggested by Brian
    Austin.

    ASoC: dpcm: Fix race between FE/BE updates and trigger
    
    commit ea9d0d771fcd32cd56070819749477d511ec9117 upstream.
    
    DPCM can update the FE/BE connection states totally asynchronously
    from the FE's PCM state.  Most of FE/BE state changes are protected by
    mutex, so that they won't race, but there are still some actions that
    are uncovered.  For example, suppose to switch a BE while a FE's
    stream is running.  This would call soc_dpcm_runtime_update(), which
    sets FE's runtime_update flag, then sets up and starts BEs, and clears
    FE's runtime_update flag again.
    
    When a device emits XRUN during this operation, the PCM core triggers
    snd_pcm_stop(XRUN).  Since the trigger action is an atomic ops, this
    isn't blocked by the mutex, thus it kicks off DPCM's trigger action.
    It eventually updates and clears FE's runtime_update flag while
    soc_dpcm_runtime_update() is running concurrently, and it results in
    confusion.
    
    Usually, for avoiding such a race, we take a lock.  There is a PCM
    stream lock for that purpose.  However, as already mentioned, the
    trigger action is atomic, and we can't take the lock for the whole
    soc_dpcm_runtime_update() or other operations that include the lengthy
    jobs like hw_params or prepare.
    
    This patch provides an alternative solution.  This adds a way to defer
    the conflicting trigger callback to be executed at the end of FE/BE
    state changes.  For doing it, two things are introduced:
    
    - Each runtime_update state change of FEs is protected via PCM stream
      lock.
    - The FE's trigger callback checks the runtime_update flag.  If it's
      not set, the trigger action is executed there.  If set, mark the
      pending trigger action and returns immediately.
    - At the exit of runtime_update state change, it checks whether the
      pending trigger is present.  If yes, it executes the trigger action
      at this point.

    The interrupts were activated and the handler registered before the clockevent
    was registered in the probe function.
    
    The interrupt handler, however, was making the assumption that the clockevent
    device was registered.
    
    That could cause a null pointer dereference if the timer interrupt was firing

    Fix that by moving the clockevent registration before the interrupt is enabled.

    commit 7fc986d8a9727e5d40da3c2c1c343da6142e82a9 upstream.

    In this kernel, unsigned long is 32 bits and dma_addr_t is 64 bits.
    Previously we used "unsigned long" to hold the bridge window address.  But
    this is a bus address, so we should use dma_addr_t instead.
    
    Use dma_addr_t to hold the bridge window base and limit.
    
    The question of whether the CPU can actually *address* the window is
    separate and depends on what the physical address space of the CPU is and
    whether the host bridge does any address translation.

    ipx: fix locking regression in ipx_sendmsg and ipx_recvmsg
    
    [ Upstream commit 01462405f0c093b2f8dfddafcadcda6c9e4c5cdf ]
    
    This fixes an old regression introduced by commit
    b0d0d915 (ipx: remove the BKL).
    
    When a recvmsg syscall blocks waiting for new data, no data can be sent on the
    same socket with sendmsg because ipx_recvmsg() sleeps with the socket locked.
    
    This breaks mars-nwe (NetWare emulator):
    - the ncpserv process reads the request using recvmsg
    - ncpserv forks and spawns nwconn
    - ncpserv calls a (blocking) recvmsg and waits for new requests
    - nwconn deadlocks in sendmsg on the same socket
    
    Commit b0d0d915 has simply replaced BKL locking with
    lock_sock/release_sock. Unlike now, BKL got unlocked while
    sleeping, so a blocking recvmsg did not block a concurrent
    sendmsg.
    
    Only keep the socket locked while actually working with the socket data and
    release it prior to calling skb_recv_datagram().

    pptp_getname() only partially initializes the stack variable sa,
    particularly only fills the pptp part of the sa_addr union. The code

    bonding: fix curr_active_slave/carrier with loadbalance arp monitoring
    
    [ Upstream commit b8e4500f42fe4464a33a887579147050bed8fcef ]
    
    Since commit 6fde8f037e60 ("bonding: fix locking in
    bond_loadbalance_arp_mon()") we can have a stale bond carrier state and
    stale curr_active_slave when using arp monitoring in loadbalance modes. The
    reason is that in bond_loadbalance_arp_mon() we can't have
    do_failover == true but slave_state_changed == false, whenever do_failover
    is true then slave_state_changed is also true. Then the following piece
    from bond_loadbalance_arp_mon():
                    if (slave_state_changed) {
                            bond_slave_state_change(bond);
                            if (BOND_MODE(bond) == BOND_MODE_XOR)
                                    bond_update_slave_arr(bond, NULL);
                    } else if (do_failover) {
                            block_netpoll_tx();
                            bond_select_active_slave(bond);
                            unblock_netpoll_tx();
                    }
    
    will execute only the first branch, always and regardless of do_failover.
    Since these two events aren't related in such way, we need to decouple and
    consider them separately.
    
    For example this issue could lead to the following result:
    Bonding Mode: load balancing (round-robin)
    *MII Status: down*
    MII Polling Interval (ms): 0
    Up Delay (ms): 0
    Down Delay (ms): 0
    ARP Polling Interval (ms): 100
    ARP IP target/s (n.n.n.n form): 192.168.9.2
    
    Slave Interface: ens12
    *MII Status: up*
    Speed: 10000 Mbps
    Duplex: full
    Link Failure Count: 2
    Permanent HW addr: 00:0f:53:01:42:2c
    Slave queue ID: 0
    
    Slave Interface: eth1
    *MII Status: up*
    Speed: Unknown
    Duplex: Unknown
    Link Failure Count: 70
    Permanent HW addr: 52:54:00:2f:0f:8e
    Slave queue ID: 0
    
    Since some interfaces are up, then the status of the bond should also be
    up, but it will never change unless something invokes bond_set_carrier()
    (i.e. enslave, bond_select_active_slave etc). Now, if I force the
    calling of bond_select_active_slave via for example changing
    primary_reselect (it can change in any mode), then the MII status goes to
    "up" because it calls bond_select_active_slave() which should've been done
    from bond_loadbalance_arp_mon() itself.

    It may be equal to 31.
    In such a case the left shift will produce a signed integer overflow.

    uprobes, x86: Fix _TIF_UPROBE vs _TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME
    
    commit 82975bc6a6df743b9a01810fb32cb65d0ec5d60b upstream.
    
    x86 call do_notify_resume on paranoid returns if TIF_UPROBE is set but
    not on non-paranoid returns.  I suspect that this is a mistake and that
    the code only works because int3 is paranoid.
    
    Setting _TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME in the uprobe code was probably a workaround
    for the x86 bug.  With that bug fixed, we can remove _TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME
    from the uprobes code.

    x86: Require exact match for 'noxsave' command line option
    
    commit 2cd3949f702692cf4c5d05b463f19cd706a92dd3 upstream.
    
    We have some very similarly named command-line options:
    
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c:__setup("noxsave", x86_xsave_setup);
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c:__setup("noxsaveopt", x86_xsaveopt_setup);
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c:__setup("noxsaves", x86_xsaves_setup);
    
    __setup() is designed to match options that take arguments, like
    "foo=bar" where you would have:
    
            __setup("foo", x86_foo_func...);
    
    The problem is that "noxsave" actually _matches_ "noxsaves" in
    the same way that "foo" matches "foo=bar".  If you boot an old
    kernel that does not know about "noxsaves" with "noxsaves" on the
    command line, it will interpret the argument as "noxsave", which
    is not what you want at all.
    
    This makes the "noxsave" handler only return success when it finds
    an *exact* match.

    x86_64, traps: Rework bad_iret
    
    commit b645af2d5905c4e32399005b867987919cbfc3ae upstream.
    
    It's possible for iretq to userspace to fail.  This can happen because
    of a bad CS, SS, or RIP.
    
    Historically, we've handled it by fixing up an exception from iretq to
    land at bad_iret, which pretends that the failed iret frame was really
    the hardware part of #GP(0) from userspace.  To make this work, there's
    an extra fixup to fudge the gs base into a usable state.
    
    This is suboptimal because it loses the original exception.  It's also
    buggy because there's no guarantee that we were on the kernel stack to
    begin with.  For example, if the failing iret happened on return from an
    NMI, then we'll end up executing general_protection on the NMI stack.
    This is bad for several reasons, the most immediate of which is that
    general_protection, as a non-paranoid idtentry, will try to deliver
    signals and/or schedule from the wrong stack.
    
    This patch throws out bad_iret entirely.  As a replacement, it augments
    the existing swapgs fudge into a full-blown iret fixup, mostly written
    in C.  It's should be clearer and more correct.

    x86_64, traps: Stop using IST for #SS
    
    commit 6f442be2fb22be02cafa606f1769fa1e6f894441 upstream.
    
    On a 32-bit kernel, this has no effect, since there are no IST stacks.
    
    On a 64-bit kernel, #SS can only happen in user code, on a failed iret
    to user space, a canonical violation on access via RSP or RBP, or a
    genuine stack segment violation in 32-bit kernel code.  The first two
    cases don't need IST, and the latter two cases are unlikely fatal bugs,
    and promoting them to double faults would be fine.
    
    This fixes a bug in which the espfix64 code mishandles a stack segment
    violation.
    
    This saves 4k of memory per CPU and a tiny bit of code.

    There's nothing special enough about the espfix64 double fault fixup to
    justify writing it in assembly.  Move it to C.
    
    This also fixes a bug: if the double fault came from an IST stack, the

    If SERIAL_8250 is compiled as a module, the platform specific setup

    At least on Loongson 3 it will trigger a build failure,

    MIPS: tlbex: Fix potential HTW race on TLBL/M/S handlers
    
    commit 070e76cb3ffe43f6855492e77c96680c562598f0 upstream.
    
    There is a potential race when probing the TLB in TLBL/M/S exception
    handlers for a matching entry. Between the time we hit a TLBL/S/M
    exception and the time we get to execute the TLBP instruction, the
    HTW may have replaced the TLB entry we are interested in hence the TLB
    probe may fail. However, in the existing handlers, we never checked the
    status of the TLBP (ie check the result in the C0/Index register). We
    fix this by adding such a check when the core implements the HTW. If
    we couldn't find a matching entry, we return back and try again.

    MIPS: r4kcache: Add EVA case for protected_writeback_dcache_line
    
    commit 83fd43449baaf88fe5c03dd0081a062041837c51 upstream.
    
    Commit de8974e3f76c0 ("MIPS: asm: r4kcache: Add EVA cache flushing
    functions") added cache function for EVA using the cachee instruction.
    However, it didn't add a case for the protected_writeback_dcache_line.
    mips_dsemul() calls r4k_flush_cache_sigtramp() which in turn uses
    the protected_writeback_dcache_line() to flush the trampoline code
    back to memory. This used the wrong "cache" instruction leading to
    random userland crashes on non-FPU cores.

    MIPS: fix EVA & non-SMP non-FPU FP context signal handling
    
    commit 14fa12df1d6bc1d3389a0fa842e0ebd8e8a9af26 upstream.
    
    The save_fp_context & restore_fp_context pointers were being assigned
    to the wrong variables if either:
    
      - The kernel is configured for UP & runs on a system without an FPU,
        since b2ead5282885 "MIPS: Move & rename
        fpu_emulator_{save,restore}_context".
    
      - The kernel is configured for EVA, since ca750649e08c "MIPS: kernel:
        signal: Prevent save/restore FPU context in user memory".
    
    This would lead to FP context being clobbered incorrectly when setting
    up a sigcontext, then the garbage values being saved uselessly when
    returning from the signal.
    
    Fix by swapping the pointer assignments appropriately.

    commit cf0a8aa0226da5de88011e7f30eff22a894b2f49 upstream.
    
    Make use of the Config6/FLTBP bit to set the probability of a TLBWR
    instruction to hit the FTLB or the VTLB. A value of 0 (which may be
    the default value on certain cores, such as proAptiv or P5600)
    means that a TLBWR instruction will never hit the VTLB which
    leads to performance limitations since it effectively decreases
    the number of available TLB slots.

    MIPS: asm: uaccess: Add v1 register to clobber list on EVA
    
    commit 58563817cfed0432e9a54476d5fc6c3aeba475e4 upstream.
    
    When EVA is turned on and prefetching is being used in memcpy.S,
    the v1 register is being used as a helper register to the PREFE
    instruction. However, v1 ($3) was not in the clobber list, which
    means that the compiler did not preserve it across function calls,
    and that could corrupt the value of the register leading to all
    sorts of userland crashes. We fix this problem by using the
    DADDI_SCRATCH macro to define the clobbered register when
    CONFIG_EVA && CONFIG_CPU_HAS_PREFETCH are enabled.

    HTW needs to stop and start again whenever the EntryHI register

    Commit cf62a8b8134dd3 ("MIPS: lib: memcpy: Use macro to build the

    symbols in preparation for the EVA support. However, this commit
    also removed the NOP instruction after the 'jr ra' when returning
    back to the caller. This had no visible side-effects since the next
    instruction was a load to the t0 register which was already in the
    clobbered list, but it may have undesired effects in the future
    if some other code is introduced in between the .Ldone and
    the .Ll_exc_copy labels.
