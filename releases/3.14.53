    tty/vt: don't set font mappings on vc not supporting this
    
    commit 9e326f78713a4421fe11afc2ddeac07698fac131 upstream.
    
    We can call this function for a dummy console that doesn't support
    setting the font mapping, which will result in a null ptr BUG. So check
    for this case and return error for consoles w/o font mapping support.

    drivercore: Fix unregistration path of platform devices
    
    commit 7f5dcaf1fdf289767a126a0a5cc3ef39b5254b06 upstream.
    
    The unregister path of platform_device is broken. On registration, it
    will register all resources with either a parent already set, or
    type==IORESOURCE_{IO,MEM}. However, on unregister it will release
    everything with type==IORESOURCE_{IO,MEM}, but ignore the others. There
    are also cases where resources don't get registered in the first place,
    like with devices created by of_platform_populate()*.
    
    Fix the unregister path to be symmetrical with the register path by
    checking the parent pointer instead of the type field to decide which
    resources to unregister. This is safe because the upshot of the
    registration path algorithm is that registered resources have a parent
    pointer, and non-registered resources do not.
    
    * It can be argued that of_platform_populate() should be registering
      it's resources, and they argument has some merit. However, there are
      quite a few platforms that end up broken if we try to do that due to
      overlapping resources in the device tree. Until that is fixed, we need
      to solve the immediate problem.

    of/address: Don't loop forever in of_find_matching_node_by_address().
    
    commit 3a496b00b6f90c41bd21a410871dfc97d4f3c7ab upstream.
    
    If the internal call to of_address_to_resource() fails, we end up
    looping forever in of_find_matching_node_by_address().  This can be
    caused by a defective device tree, or calling with an incorrect
    matches argument.
    
    Fix by calling of_find_matching_node() unconditionally at the end of
    the loop.

    commit bab383de3b84e584b0f09227151020b2a43dc34c upstream.
    
    parport_find_base() will implicitly do parport_get_port() which
    increases the refcount. Then parport_register_device() will again
    increment the refcount. But while unloading the module we are only
    doing parport_unregister_device() decrementing the refcount only once.
    We add an parport_put_port() to neutralize the effect of
    parport_get_port().

    KVM: MMU: fix validation of mmio page fault
    
    commit 6f691251c0350ac52a007c54bf3ef62e9d8cdc5e upstream.
    
    We got the bug that qemu complained with "KVM: unknown exit, hardware
    reason 31" and KVM shown these info:
    [84245.284948] EPT: Misconfiguration.
    [84245.285056] EPT: GPA: 0xfeda848
    [84245.285154] ept_misconfig_inspect_spte: spte 0x5eaef50107 level 4
    [84245.285344] ept_misconfig_inspect_spte: spte 0x5f5fadc107 level 3
    [84245.285532] ept_misconfig_inspect_spte: spte 0x5141d18107 level 2
    [84245.285723] ept_misconfig_inspect_spte: spte 0x52e40dad77 level 1
    
    This is because we got a mmio #PF and the handler see the mmio spte becomes
    normal (points to the ram page)
    
    However, this is valid after introducing fast mmio spte invalidation which
    increases the generation-number instead of zapping mmio sptes, a example
    is as follows:
    1. QEMU drops mmio region by adding a new memslot
    2. invalidate all mmio sptes
    3.
    
            VCPU 0                        VCPU 1
        access the invalid mmio spte
                                access the region originally was MMIO before
                                set the spte to the normal ram map
    
        mmio #PF
        check the spte and see it becomes normal ram mapping !!!
    
    This patch fixes the bug just by dropping the check in mmio handler, it's
    good for backport. Full check will be introduced in later patches

    HID: usbhid: Fix the check for HID_RESET_PENDING in hid_io_error
    
    commit 3af4e5a95184d6d3c1c6a065f163faa174a96a1d upstream.
    
    It was reported that after 10-20 reboots, a usb keyboard plugged
    into a docking station would not work unless it was replugged in.
    
    Using usbmon, it turns out the interrupt URBs were streaming with
    callback errors of -71 for some reason.  The hid-core.c::hid_io_error was
    supposed to retry and then reset, but the reset wasn't really happening.
    
    The check for HID_NO_BANDWIDTH was inverted.  Fix was simple.
    
    Tested by reporter and locally by me by unplugging a keyboard halfway until I
    could recreate a stream of errors but no disconnect.

    commit b2fb5b1a0f50d3ebc12342c8d8dead245e9c9d4e upstream.
    
    DWC3 uses bounce buffer to handle non max packet aligned OUT transfers and
    the size of bounce buffer is 512 bytes. However if the host initiates OUT
    transfers of size more than 512 bytes (and non max packet aligned), the
    driver throws a WARN dump but still programs the TRB to receive more than
    512 bytes. This will cause bounce buffer to overflow and corrupt the
    adjacent memory locations which can be fatal.
    
    Fix it by programming the TRB to receive a maximum of DWC3_EP0_BOUNCE_SIZE
    (512) bytes.

    on the PCI-7230.  This has 16 digital output channels and the previous
    adl_pci7230 driver shifted the 16 bit output state left by 16 bits
    before writing to the hardware register.  The new adl_pci7x3x driver
    doesn't do that.  Fix it in `adl_pci7x3x_do_insn_bits()` by checking
    for the special case of the subdevice having only 16 channels and
    duplicating the 16 bit output state into both halves of the 32-bit
    register.  That should work both for what the board actually does and
    for what the user manual says it should do.

    iio: Add inverse unit conversion macros
    
    commit c689a923c867eac40ed3826c1d9328edea8b6bc7 upstream.
    
    Add inverse unit conversion macro to convert from standard IIO units to
    units that might be used by some devices.
    
    Those are useful in combination with scale factors that are specified as
    IIO_VAL_FRACTIONAL. Typically the denominator for those specifications will
    contain the maximum raw value the sensor will generate and the numerator
    the value it maps to in a specific unit. Sometimes datasheets specify those
    in different units than the standard IIO units (e.g. degree/s instead of
    rad/s) and so we need to do a unit conversion.
    
    From a mathematical point of view it does not make a difference whether we
    apply the unit conversion to the numerator or the inverse unit conversion
    to the denominator since (x / y) / z = x / (y * z). But as the denominator
    is typically a larger value and we are rounding both the numerator and
    denominator to integer values using the later method gives us a better
    precision (E.g. the relative error is smaller if we round 8000.3 to 8000
    rather than rounding 8.3 to 8).
    
    This is where in inverse unit conversion macros will be used.
    
    Marked for stable as used by some upcoming fixes.

    drm/qxl: validate monitors config modes
    
    commit bd3e1c7c6de9f5f70d97cdb6c817151c0477c5e3 upstream.
    
    Due to some recent changes in
    drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes_merge_bits(), old custom modes
    were not being pruned properly. In current kernels,
    drm_mode_validate_basic() is called to sanity-check each mode in the
    list. If the sanity-check passes, the mode's status gets set to to
    MODE_OK. In older kernels this check was not done, so old custom modes
    would still have a status of MODE_UNVERIFIED at this point, and would
    therefore be pruned later in the function.
    
    As a result of this new behavior, the list of modes for a device always
    includes every custom mode ever configured for the device, with the
    largest one listed first. Since desktop environments usually choose the
    first preferred mode when a hotplug event is emitted, this had the
    result of making it very difficult for the user to reduce the size of
    the display.
    
    The qxl driver did implement the mode_valid connector function, but it
    was empty. In order to restore the old behavior where old custom modes
    are pruned, we implement a proper mode_valid function for the qxl
    driver. This function now checks each mode against the last configured
    custom mode and the list of standard modes. If the mode doesn't match
    any of these, its status is set to MODE_BAD so that it will be pruned as
    expected.

    DRM - radeon: Don't link train DisplayPort on HPD until we get the dpcd
    
    commit 924f92bf12bfbef3662619e3ed24a1cea7c1cbcd upstream.
    
    Most of the time this isn't an issue since hotplugging an adaptor will
    trigger a crtc mode change which in turn, causes the driver to probe
    every DisplayPort for a dpcd. However, in cases where hotplugging
    doesn't cause a mode change (specifically when one unplugs a monitor
    from a DisplayPort connector, then plugs that same monitor back in
    seconds later on the same port without any other monitors connected), we
    never probe for the dpcd before starting the initial link training. What
    happens from there looks like this:
    
            - GPU has only one monitor connected. It's connected via
              DisplayPort, and does not go through an adaptor of any sort.
    
            - User unplugs DisplayPort connector from GPU.
    
            - Change in HPD is detected by the driver, we probe every
              DisplayPort for a possible connection.
    
            - Probe the port the user originally had the monitor connected
              on for it's dpcd. This fails, and we clear the first (and only
              the first) byte of the dpcd to indicate we no longer have a
              dpcd for this port.
    
            - User plugs the previously disconnected monitor back into the
              same DisplayPort.
    
            - radeon_connector_hotplug() is called before everyone else,
              and tries to handle the link training. Since only the first
              byte of the dpcd is zeroed, the driver is able to complete
              link training but does so against the wrong dpcd, causing it
              to initialize the link with the wrong settings.
    
            - Display stays blank (usually), dpcd is probed after the
              initial link training, and the driver prints no obvious
              messages to the log.
    
    In theory, since only one byte of the dpcd is chopped off (specifically,
    the byte that contains the revision information for DisplayPort), it's
    not entirely impossible that this bug may not show on certain monitors.
    For instance, the only reason this bug was visible on my ASUS PB238
    monitor was due to the fact that this monitor using the enhanced framing
    symbol sequence, the flag for which is ignored if the radeon driver
    thinks that the DisplayPort version is below 1.1.
