    commit dd99e9f98fbf423ff6d365b37a98e8879170f17c upstream.
    
    Set up the connection to the NFSv4 server in nfs4_alloc_client(), before
    we've added the struct nfs_client to the net-namespace's nfs_client_list
    so that a downed server won't cause other mounts to hang in the trunking
    detection code.

    gianfar: fix jumbo packets+napi+rx overrun crash
    
    commit d8861bab48b6c1fc3cdbcab8ff9d1eaea43afe7f upstream.
    
    When using jumbo packets and overrunning rx queue with napi enabled,
    the following sequence is observed in gfar_add_rx_frag:
    
       | lstatus                              |       | skb                   |
    t  | lstatus,  size, flags                | first | len, data_len, *ptr   |
    ---+--------------------------------------+-------+-----------------------+
    13 | 18002348, 9032, INTERRUPT LAST       | 0     | 9600, 8000,  f554c12e |

    09 | 10000640, 1600, INTERRUPT            | 0     | 3200, 1600,  f554c12e |

    07 | 14000640, 1600, INTERRUPT FIRST      | 1     | 0,    0,     f554c12e |
    06 | 1c000080, 128,  INTERRUPT LAST FIRST | 1     | 0,    0,     abf3bd6e |
    05 | 18002348, 9032, INTERRUPT LAST       | 0     | 8000, 6400,  c5a57780 |
    04 | 10000640, 1600, INTERRUPT            | 0     | 6400, 4800,  c5a57780 |
    03 | 10000640, 1600, INTERRUPT            | 0     | 4800, 3200,  c5a57780 |

    So at t=7 a new packets is started but not finished, probably due to rx
    overrun - but rx overrun is not indicated in the flags. Instead a new
    packets starts at t=8. This results in skb->len to exceed size for the LAST
    fragment at t=13 and thus a negative fragment size added to the skb.
    
    This then crashes:
    
    kernel BUG at include/linux/skbuff.h:2277!

    This patch fixes this by checking for computed LAST fragment size, so a
    negative sized fragment is never added.
    In order to prevent the newer rx frame from getting corrupted, the FIRST
    flag is checked to discard the incomplete older frame.

    gianfar: simplify FCS handling and fix memory leak
    
    commit d903ec77118c09f93a610b384d83a6df33a64fe6 upstream.
    
    Previously, buffer descriptors containing only the frame check sequence
    (FCS) were skipped and not added to the skb. However, the page reference
    count was still incremented, leading to a memory leak.
    
    Fixing this inside gfar_add_rx_frag() is difficult due to reserved
    memory handling and page reuse. Instead, move the FCS handling to
    gfar_process_frame() and trim off the FCS before passing the skb up the
    networking stack.

    fuse: fix live lock in fuse_iget()
    
    commit 775c5033a0d164622d9d10dd0f0a5531639ed3ed upstream.
    
    Commit 5d069dbe8aaf ("fuse: fix bad inode") replaced make_bad_inode()
    in fuse_iget() with a private implementation fuse_make_bad().
    
    The private implementation fails to remove the bad inode from inode
    cache, so the retry loop with iget5_locked() finds the same bad inode
    and marks it bad forever.

    fuse: fix bad inode
    
    commit 5d069dbe8aaf2a197142558b6fb2978189ba3454 upstream.
    
    Jan Kara's analysis of the syzbot report (edited):
    
      The reproducer opens a directory on FUSE filesystem, it then attaches
      dnotify mark to the open directory.  After that a fuse_do_getattr() call
      finds that attributes returned by the server are inconsistent, and calls
      make_bad_inode() which, among other things does:
    
              inode->i_mode = S_IFREG;
    
      This then confuses dnotify which doesn't tear down its structures
      properly and eventually crashes.
    
    Avoid calling make_bad_inode() on a live inode: switch to a private flag on
    the fuse inode.  Also add the test to ops which the bad_inode_ops would
    have caught.
    
    This bug goes back to the initial merge of fuse in 2.6.14...

    Just make the API act under driver control of it's own allocation
    failing, and don't call destroy, if the page table fails to

    net_sched: restore "mpu xxx" handling
    
    commit fb80445c438c78b40b547d12b8d56596ce4ccfeb upstream.
    
    commit 56b765b79e9a ("htb: improved accuracy at high rates") broke
    "overhead X", "linklayer atm" and "mpu X" attributes.
    
    "overhead X" and "linklayer atm" have already been fixed. This restores
    the "mpu X" handling, as might be used by DOCSIS or Ethernet shaping:
    
        tc class add ... htb rate X overhead 4 mpu 64
    
    The code being fixed is used by htb, tbf and act_police. Cake has its
    own mpu handling. qdisc_calculate_pkt_len still uses the size table
    containing values adjusted for mpu by user space.
    
    iproute2 tc has always passed mpu into the kernel via a tc_ratespec
    structure, but the kernel never directly acted on it, merely stored it
    so that it could be read back by `tc class show`.
    
    Rather, tc would generate length-to-time tables that included the mpu
    (and linklayer) in their construction, and the kernel used those tables.
    
    Since v3.7, the tables were no longer used. Along with "mpu", this also
    broke "overhead" and "linklayer" which were fixed in 01cb71d2d47b
    ("net_sched: restore "overhead xxx" handling", v3.10) and 8a8e3d84b171
    ("net_sched: restore "linklayer atm" handling", v3.11).
    
    "overhead" was fixed by simply restoring use of tc_ratespec::overhead -
    this had originally been used by the kernel but was initially omitted
    from the new non-table-based calculations.
    
    "linklayer" had been handled in the table like "mpu", but the mode was
    not originally passed in tc_ratespec. The new implementation was made to
    handle it by getting new versions of tc to pass the mode in an extended
    tc_ratespec, and for older versions of tc the table contents were analysed
    at load time to deduce linklayer.
    
    As "mpu" has always been given to the kernel in tc_ratespec,
    accompanying the mpu-based table, we can restore system functionality
    with no userspace change by making the kernel act on the tc_ratespec
    value.

    AT_XDMAC_CNDC_NDVIEW_NDV3 was set even for AT_XDMAC_MBR_UBC_NDV2,
    because of the wrong bit handling. Fix it.

    commit 5edc24ac876a928f36f407a0fcdb33b94a3a210f upstream.
    
    It is desirable to do the prints without the lock held if possible, so
    move the print after the lock is released.

    dmaengine: at_xdmac: Don't start transactions at tx_submit level
    
    commit bccfb96b59179d4f96cbbd1ddff8fac6d335eae4 upstream.
    
    tx_submit is supposed to push the current transaction descriptor to a
    pending queue, waiting for issue_pending() to be called. issue_pending()
    must start the transfer, not tx_submit(), thus remove
    at_xdmac_start_xfer() from at_xdmac_tx_submit(). Clients of at_xdmac that
    assume that tx_submit() starts the transfer must be updated and call
    dma_async_issue_pending() if they miss to call it (one example is
    atmel_serial).
    
    As the at_xdmac_start_xfer() is now called only from
    at_xdmac_advance_work() when !at_xdmac_chan_is_enabled(), the
    at_xdmac_chan_is_enabled() check is no longer needed in
    at_xdmac_start_xfer(), thus remove it.

    commit a915deaa9abe4fb3a440312c954253a6a733608e upstream.
    
    Mask the ECN bits before calling ip_route_output_ports(). The tos
    variable might be passed directly from an IPv4 header, so it may have
    the last ECN bit set. This interferes with the route lookup process as
    ip_route_output_key_hash() interpretes this bit specially (to restrict
    the route scope).
    
    Found by code inspection, compile tested only.

    netns: add schedule point in ops_exit_list()
    
    commit 2836615aa22de55b8fca5e32fe1b27a67cda625e upstream.
    
    When under stress, cleanup_net() can have to dismantle
    netns in big numbers. ops_exit_list() currently calls
    many helpers [1] that have no schedule point, and we can
    end up with soft lockups, particularly on hosts
    with many cpus.
    
    Even for moderate amount of netns processed by cleanup_net()
    this patch avoids latency spikes.
    
    [1] Some of these helpers like fib_sync_up() and fib_sync_down_dev()
    are very slow because net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c uses host-wide hash tables,
    and ifindex is used as the only input of two hash functions.
        ifindexes tend to be the same for all netns (lo.ifindex==1 per instance)
        This will be fixed in a separate patch.

    net: axienet: Wait for PhyRstCmplt after core reset
    
    commit b400c2f4f4c53c86594dd57098970d97d488bfde upstream.
    
    When resetting the device, wait for the PhyRstCmplt bit to be set
    in the interrupt status register before continuing initialization, to
    ensure that the core is actually ready. When using an external PHY, this
    also ensures we do not start trying to access the PHY while it is still
    in reset. The PHY reset is initiated by the core reset which is
    triggered just above, but remains asserted for 5ms after the core is
    reset according to the documentation.
    
    The MgtRdy bit could also be waited for, but unfortunately when using
    7-series devices, the bit does not appear to work as documented (it
    seems to behave as some sort of link state indication and not just an
    indication the transceiver is ready) so it can't really be relied on for
    this purpose.

    randomization. They probably just confused SLAB with BASE (these two
    four-letter words coincidentally share three common letters), as they also
    point out the config SLAB_FREELIST_RANDOM as further randomization within
    the same sentence.

    the config that provides that.

    Just add proper error handling.

    crypto: stm32/crc32 - Fix kernel BUG triggered in probe()
    
    commit 29009604ad4e3ef784fd9b9fef6f23610ddf633d upstream.
    
    The include/linux/crypto.h struct crypto_alg field cra_driver_name description
    states "Unique name of the transformation provider. " ... " this contains the
    name of the chip or provider and the name of the transformation algorithm."
    
    In case of the stm32-crc driver, field cra_driver_name is identical for all
    registered transformation providers and set to the name of the driver itself,
    which is incorrect. This patch fixes it by assigning a unique cra_driver_name
    to each registered transformation provider.
    
    The kernel crash is triggered when the driver calls crypto_register_shashes()
    which calls crypto_register_shash(), which calls crypto_register_alg(), which
    calls __crypto_register_alg(), which returns -EEXIST, which is propagated
    back through this call chain. Upon -EEXIST from crypto_register_shash(), the
    crypto_register_shashes() starts unregistering the providers back, and calls
    crypto_unregister_shash(), which calls crypto_unregister_alg(), and this is
    where the BUG() triggers due to incorrect cra_refcnt.

    ext4: don't use the orphan list when migrating an inode
    
    commit 6eeaf88fd586f05aaf1d48cb3a139d2a5c6eb055 upstream.
    
    We probably want to remove the indirect block to extents migration
    feature after a deprecation window, but until then, let's fix a
    potential data loss problem caused by the fact that we put the
    tmp_inode on the orphan list.  In the unlikely case where we crash and
    do a journal recovery, the data blocks belonging to the inode being
    migrated are also represented in the tmp_inode on the orphan list ---
    and so its data blocks will get marked unallocated, and available for
    reuse.
    
    Instead, stop putting the tmp_inode on the oprhan list.  So in the
    case where we crash while migrating the inode, we'll leak an inode,
    which is not a disaster.  It will be easily fixed the next time we run
    fsck, and it's better than potentially having blocks getting claimed
    by two different files, and losing data as a result.

    In order to reproduce this problem, the following conditions need to be met:
    1. Ext4 filesystem with no journal;
    2. Filesystem image with incorrect quota data;
    3. Abort filesystem forced by user;
    4. umount filesystem;
    
    As in ext4_quota_write:
    ...
             if (EXT4_SB(sb)->s_journal && !handle) {
                     ext4_msg(sb, KERN_WARNING, "Quota write (off=%llu, len=%llu)"
                             " cancelled because transaction is not started",
                             (unsigned long long)off, (unsigned long long)len);
                     return -EIO;
             }
    ...
    We only check handle if NULL when filesystem has journal. There is need
    check handle if NULL even when filesystem has no journal.

    ext4: set csum seed in tmp inode while migrating to extents
    
    commit e81c9302a6c3c008f5c30beb73b38adb0170ff2d upstream.
    
    When migrating to extents, the temporary inode will have it's own checksum
    seed.  This means that, when swapping the inodes data, the inode checksums
    will be incorrect.
    
    This can be fixed by recalculating the extents checksums again.  Or simply
    by copying the seed into the temporary inode.

    ext4: make sure quota gets properly shutdown on error
    
    commit 15fc69bbbbbc8c72e5f6cc4e1be0f51283c5448e upstream.
    
    When we hit an error when enabling quotas and setting inode flags, we do
    not properly shutdown quota subsystem despite returning error from
    Q_QUOTAON quotactl. This can lead to some odd situations like kernel
    using quota file while it is still writeable for userspace. Make sure we
    properly cleanup the quota subsystem in case of error.

    iwlwifi: mvm: Increase the scan timeout guard to 30 seconds
    
    commit ced50f1133af12f7521bb777fcf4046ca908fb77 upstream.
    
    With the introduction of 6GHz channels the scan guard timeout should
    be adjusted to account for the following extreme case:
    
    - All 6GHz channels are scanned passively: 58 channels.
    - The scan is fragmented with the following parameters: 3 fragments,
      95 TUs suspend time, 44 TUs maximal out of channel time.
    
    The above would result with scan time of more than 24 seconds. Thus,
    set the timeout to 30 seconds.

    serial: Fix incorrect rs485 polarity on uart open
    
    commit d3b3404df318504ec084213ab1065b73f49b0f1d upstream.
    
    Commit a6845e1e1b78 ("serial: core: Consider rs485 settings to drive
    RTS") sought to deassert RTS when opening an rs485-enabled uart port.
    That way, the transceiver does not occupy the bus until it transmits
    data.
    
    Unfortunately, the commit mixed up the logic and *asserted* RTS instead
    of *deasserting* it:
    
    The commit amended uart_port_dtr_rts(), which raises DTR and RTS when
    opening an rs232 port.  "Raising" actually means lowering the signal
    that's coming out of the uart, because an rs232 transceiver not only
    changes a signal's voltage level, it also *inverts* the signal.  See
    the simplified schematic in the MAX232 datasheet for an example:
    https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/max232.pdf
    
    So, to raise RTS on an rs232 port, TIOCM_RTS is *set* in port->mctrl
    and that results in the signal being driven low.
    
    In contrast to rs232, the signal level for rs485 Transmit Enable is the
    identity, not the inversion:  If the transceiver expects a "high" RTS
    signal for Transmit Enable, the signal coming out of the uart must also
    be high, so TIOCM_RTS must be *cleared* in port->mctrl.
    
    The commit did the exact opposite, but it's easy to see why given the
    confusing semantics of rs232 and rs485.  Fix it.

    To reproduce the problem:
    
    1. Filesystem initially mounted read-only, free space fixup flag set.
    
    2. mount -o remount,rw <mountpoint>
    
    3. it takes some time (free space fixup running)
        ... try to terminate running mount by CTRL-C
        ... does not respond, only after free space fixup is complete
        ... then "ubifs_remount_fs: cannot spawn "ubifs_bgt0_0", error -4"
    
    4. mount -o remount,rw <mountpoint>
        ... now finished instantly (fixup already done).
    
    5. Create file or just unmount the filesystem and we get the oops.

    ALSA: seq: Set upper limit of processed events
    
    [ Upstream commit 6fadb494a638d8b8a55864ecc6ac58194f03f327 ]
    
    Currently ALSA sequencer core tries to process the queued events as
    much as possible when they become dispatchable.  If applications try
    to queue too massive events to be processed at the very same timing,
    the sequencer core would still try to process such all events, either
    in the interrupt context or via some notifier; in either away, it
    might be a cause of RCU stall or such problems.
    
    As a potential workaround for those problems, this patch adds the
    upper limit of the amount of events to be processed.  The remaining
    events are processed in the next batch, so they won't be lost.
    
    For the time being, it's limited up to 1000 events per queue, which
    should be high enough for any normal usages.

    The buffer buf is a failsafe buffer in kernel space, it's not user

    i2c: mpc: Correct I2C reset procedure
    
    [ Upstream commit ebe82cf92cd4825c3029434cabfcd2f1780e64be ]
    
    Current I2C reset procedure is broken in two ways:
    1) It only generate 1 START instead of 9 STARTs and STOP.
    2) It leaves the bus Busy so every I2C xfer after the first
       fixup calls the reset routine again, for every xfer there after.
    
    This fixes both errors.

    i2c: i801: Don't silently correct invalid transfer size
    
    [ Upstream commit effa453168a7eeb8a562ff4edc1dbf9067360a61 ]
    
    If an invalid block size is provided, reject it instead of silently
    changing it to a supported value. Especially critical I see the case of
    a write transfer with block length 0. In this case we have no guarantee
    that the byte we would write is valid. When silently reducing a read to
    32 bytes then we don't return an error and the caller may falsely
    assume that we returned the full requested data.
    
    If this change should break any (broken) caller, then I think we should
    fix the caller.

    powerpc/watchdog: Fix missed watchdog reset due to memory ordering race
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dad4ba68a2483fc80d70b9dc90bbe16e1f27263 ]
    
    It is possible for all CPUs to miss the pending cpumask becoming clear,
    and then nobody resetting it, which will cause the lockup detector to
    stop working. It will eventually expire, but watchdog_smp_panic will
    avoid doing anything if the pending mask is clear and it will never be
    reset.
    
    Order the cpumask clear vs the subsequent test to close this race.
    
    Add an extra check for an empty pending mask when the watchdog fires and
    finds its bit still clear, to try to catch any other possible races or
    bugs here and keep the watchdog working. The extra test in
    arch_touch_nmi_watchdog is required to prevent the new warning from
    firing off.

    parisc: Avoid calling faulthandler_disabled() twice
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e9d4b460f23bab61672eae397417d03917d116c ]
    
    In handle_interruption(), we call faulthandler_disabled() to check whether the
    fault handler is not disabled. If the fault handler is disabled, we immediately
    call do_page_fault(). It then calls faulthandler_disabled(). If disabled,
    do_page_fault() attempts to fixup the exception by jumping to no_context:
    
    no_context:
    
            if (!user_mode(regs) && fixup_exception(regs)) {
                    return;
            }
    
            parisc_terminate("Bad Address (null pointer deref?)", regs, code, address);
    
    Apart from the error messages, the two blocks of code perform the same
    function.
    
    We can avoid two calls to faulthandler_disabled() by a simple revision
    to the code in handle_interruption().
    
    Note: I didn't try to fix the formatting of this code block.

    serial: core: Keep mctrl register state and cached copy in sync
    
    [ Upstream commit 93a770b7e16772530196674ffc79bb13fa927dc6 ]
    
    struct uart_port contains a cached copy of the Modem Control signals.
    It is used to skip register writes in uart_update_mctrl() if the new
    signal state equals the old signal state.  It also avoids a register
    read to obtain the current state of output signals.
    
    When a uart_port is registered, uart_configure_port() changes signal
    state but neglects to keep the cached copy in sync.  That may cause
    a subsequent register write to be incorrectly skipped.  Fix it before
    it trips somebody up.
    
    This behavior has been present ever since the serial core was introduced
    in 2002:
    https://git.kernel.org/history/history/c/33c0d1b0c3eb
    
    So far it was never an issue because the cached copy is initialized to 0
    by kzalloc() and when uart_configure_port() is executed, at most DTR has
    been set by uart_set_options() or sunsu_console_setup().  Therefore,
    a stable designation seems unnecessary.

    serial: pl010: Drop CR register reset on set_termios
    
    [ Upstream commit 08a0c6dff91c965e39905cf200d22db989203ccb ]
    
    pl010_set_termios() briefly resets the CR register to zero.
    
    Where does this register write come from?
    
    The PL010 driver's IRQ handler ambauart_int() originally modified the CR
    register without holding the port spinlock.  ambauart_set_termios() also
    modified that register.  To prevent concurrent read-modify-writes by the
    IRQ handler and to prevent transmission while changing baudrate,
    ambauart_set_termios() had to disable interrupts.  That is achieved by
    writing zero to the CR register.
    
    However in 2004 the PL010 driver was amended to acquire the port
    spinlock in the IRQ handler, obviating the need to disable interrupts in
    ->set_termios():
    https://git.kernel.org/history/history/c/157c0342e591
    
    That rendered the CR register write obsolete.  Drop it.

    net: phy: marvell: configure RGMII delays for 88E1118
    
    [ Upstream commit f22725c95ececb703c3f741e8f946d23705630b7 ]
    
    Corentin Labbe reports that the SSI 1328 does not work when allowing
    the PHY to operate at gigabit speeds, but does work with the generic
    PHY driver.
    
    This appears to be because m88e1118_config_init() writes a fixed value
    to the MSCR register, claiming that this is to enable 1G speeds.
    However, this always sets bits 4 and 5, enabling RGMII transmit and
    receive delays. The suspicion is that the original board this was
    added for required the delays to make 1G speeds work.
    
    Add the necessary configuration for RGMII delays for the 88E1118 to
    bring this into line with the requirements for RGMII support, and thus
    make the SSI 1328 work.
    
    Corentin Labbe has tested this on gemini-ssi1328 and gemini-ns2502.

    Some AP can possibly try non-standard VHT rate and mac80211 warns and drops
    packets, and leads low TCP throughput.

    ACPICA: Hardware: Do not flush CPU cache when entering S4 and S5
    
    [ Upstream commit 1d4e0b3abb168b2ee1eca99c527cffa1b80b6161 ]
    
    ACPICA commit 3dd7e1f3996456ef81bfe14cba29860e8d42949e
    
    According to ACPI 6.4, Section 16.2, the CPU cache flushing is
    required on entering to S1, S2, and S3, but the ACPICA code
    flushes the CPU cache regardless of the sleep state.
    
    Blind cache flush on entering S5 causes problems for TDX.
    
    Flushing happens with WBINVD that is not supported in the TDX
    environment.
    
    TDX only supports S5 and adjusting ACPICA code to conform to the
    spec more strictly fixes the issue.

    ACPICA: Executer: Fix the REFCLASS_REFOF case in acpi_ex_opcode_1A_0T_1R()
    
    [ Upstream commit 24ea5f90ec9548044a6209685c5010edd66ffe8f ]
    
    ACPICA commit d984f12041392fa4156b52e2f7e5c5e7bc38ad9e
    
    If Operand[0] is a reference of the ACPI_REFCLASS_REFOF class,
    acpi_ex_opcode_1A_0T_1R () calls acpi_ns_get_attached_object () to
    obtain return_desc which may require additional resolution with
    the help of acpi_ex_read_data_from_field (). If the latter fails,
    the reference counter of the original return_desc is decremented
    which is incorrect, because acpi_ns_get_attached_object () does not
    increment the reference counter of the object returned by it.
    
    This issue may lead to premature deletion of the attached object
    while it is still attached and a use-after-free and crash in the
    host OS.  For example, this may happen when on evaluation of ref_of()
    a local region field where there is no registered handler for the
    given Operation Region.
    
    Fix it by making acpi_ex_opcode_1A_0T_1R () return Status right away
    after a acpi_ex_read_data_from_field () failure.

    ACPICA: Utilities: Avoid deleting the same object twice in a row
    
    [ Upstream commit 1cdfe9e346b4c5509ffe19ccde880fd259d9f7a3 ]
    
    ACPICA commit c11af67d8f7e3d381068ce7771322f2b5324d687
    
    If original_count is 0 in acpi_ut_update_ref_count (),
    acpi_ut_delete_internal_obj () is invoked for the target object, which is
    incorrect, because that object has been deleted once already and the
    memory allocated to store it may have been reclaimed and allocated
    for a different purpose by the host OS.  Moreover, a confusing debug
    message following the "Reference Count is already zero, cannot
    decrement" warning is printed in that case.
    
    To fix this issue, make acpi_ut_update_ref_count () return after finding
    that original_count is 0 and printing the above warning.

    ACPICA: actypes.h: Expand the ACPI_ACCESS_ definitions
    
    [ Upstream commit f81bdeaf816142e0729eea0cc84c395ec9673151 ]
    
    ACPICA commit bc02c76d518135531483dfc276ed28b7ee632ce1
    
    The current ACPI_ACCESS_*_WIDTH defines do not provide a way to
    test that size is small enough to not cause an overflow when
    applied to a 32-bit integer.
    
    Rather than adding more magic numbers, add ACPI_ACCESS_*_SHIFT,
    ACPI_ACCESS_*_MAX, and ACPI_ACCESS_*_DEFAULT #defines and
    redefine ACPI_ACCESS_*_WIDTH in terms of the new #defines.
    
    This was inititally reported on Linux where a size of 102 in
    ACPI_ACCESS_BIT_WIDTH caused an overflow error in the SPCR
    initialization code.

    jffs2: GC deadlock reading a page that is used in jffs2_write_begin()
    
    [ Upstream commit aa39cc675799bc92da153af9a13d6f969c348e82 ]
    
    GC task can deadlock in read_cache_page() because it may attempt
    to release a page that is actually allocated by another task in
    jffs2_write_begin().
    The reason is that in jffs2_write_begin() there is a small window
    a cache page is allocated for use but not set Uptodate yet.
    
    This ends up with a deadlock between two tasks:
    1) A task (e.g. file copy)
       - jffs2_write_begin() locks a cache page
       - jffs2_write_end() tries to lock "alloc_sem" from
             jffs2_reserve_space() <-- STUCK
    2) GC task (jffs2_gcd_mtd3)
       - jffs2_garbage_collect_pass() locks "alloc_sem"
       - try to lock the same cache page in read_cache_page() <-- STUCK
    
    So to avoid this deadlock, hold "alloc_sem" in jffs2_write_begin()
    while reading data in a cache page.

    The function names init_registers() and restore_registers() are used
    in several net/ethernet/ and gpu/drm/ drivers for other purposes (not
    calls to UML functions), so rename them.

    iwlwifi: remove module loading failure message
    
    [ Upstream commit 6518f83ffa51131daaf439b66094f684da3fb0ae ]
    
    When CONFIG_DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE is set, iwlwifi crashes
    when the opmode module cannot be loaded, due to completing
    the completion before using drv->dev, which can then already
    be freed.
    
    Fix this by removing the (fairly useless) message. Moving the
    completion later causes a deadlock instead, so that's not an
    option.

    iwlwifi: fix leaks/bad data after failed firmware load
    
    [ Upstream commit ab07506b0454bea606095951e19e72c282bfbb42 ]
    
    If firmware load fails after having loaded some parts of the
    firmware, e.g. the IML image, then this would leak. For the
    host command list we'd end up running into a WARN on the next
    attempt to load another firmware image.
    
    Fix this by calling iwl_dealloc_ucode() on failures, and make
    that also clear the data so we start fresh on the next round.

    ath9k: Fix out-of-bound memcpy in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ce708f54cc8d73beca213cec66ede5ce100a781 ]
    
    Large pkt_len can lead to out-out-bound memcpy. Current
    ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream allows combining the content of two urb
    inputs to one pkt. The first input can indicate the size of the
    pkt. Any remaining size is saved in hif_dev->rx_remain_len.
    While processing the next input, memcpy is used with rx_remain_len.
    
    4-byte pkt_len can go up to 0xffff, while a single input is 0x4000
    maximum in size (MAX_RX_BUF_SIZE). Thus, the patch adds a check for
    pkt_len which must not exceed 2 * MAX_RX_BUG_SIZE.

    I found the bug using a custome USBFuzz port. It's a research work
    to fuzz USB stack/drivers. I modified it to fuzz ath9k driver only,
    providing hand-crafted usb descriptors to QEMU.
    
    After fixing the value of pkt_tag to ATH_USB_RX_STREAM_MODE_TAG in QEMU
    emulation, I found the KASAN report. The bug is triggerable whenever
    pkt_len is above two MAX_RX_BUG_SIZE. I used the same input that crashes
    to test the driver works when applying the patch.

    USB 3.2 spec, 9.2.5.4 "Changing Function Suspend State" says that "If
    the link is in a non-U0 state, then the device must transition the link
    to U0 prior to sending the remote wake message", but the hub only
    transits the link to U0 after signaling remote wakeup.
    
    So be more forgiving and use a 20ms delay to let the link transit to U0
    for remote wakeup.

    mmc: core: Fixup storing of OCR for MMC_QUIRK_NONSTD_SDIO
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c3e5b74b9e2146f564905e50ca716591c76d4f1 ]
    
    The mmc core takes a specific path to support initializing of a
    non-standard SDIO card. This is triggered by looking for the card-quirk,
    MMC_QUIRK_NONSTD_SDIO.
    
    In mmc_sdio_init_card() this gets rather messy, as it causes the code to
    bail out earlier, compared to the usual path. This leads to that the OCR
    doesn't get saved properly in card->ocr. Fortunately, only omap_hsmmc has
    been using the MMC_QUIRK_NONSTD_SDIO and is dealing with the issue, by
    assigning a hardcoded value (0x80) to card->ocr from an ->init_card() ops.
    
    To make the behaviour consistent, let's instead rely on the core to save
    the OCR in card->ocr during initialization.

    media: saa7146: hexium_gemini: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in hexium_attach()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3af86b046933ba513d08399dba0d4d8b50d607d0 ]
    
    In hexium_attach(dev, info), saa7146_vv_init() is called to allocate
    a new memory for dev->vv_data. saa7146_vv_release() will be called on
    failure of saa7146_register_device(). There is a dereference of
    dev->vv_data in saa7146_vv_release(), which could lead to a NULL
    pointer dereference on failure of saa7146_vv_init().
    
    Fix this bug by adding a check of saa7146_vv_init().
    
    This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
    differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
    (e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
    inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
    the callers, so they constitute bugs.
    
    Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
    positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
    the bug.
    
    Builds with CONFIG_VIDEO_HEXIUM_GEMINI=m show no new warnings,
    and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.

    bpf: Do not WARN in bpf_warn_invalid_xdp_action()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2cbad989033bff0256675c38f96f5faab852af4b ]
    
    The WARN_ONCE() in bpf_warn_invalid_xdp_action() can be triggered by
    any bugged program, and even attaching a correct program to a NIC
    not supporting the given action.
    
    The resulting splat, beyond polluting the logs, fouls automated tools:
    e.g. a syzkaller reproducers using an XDP program returning an
    unsupported action will never pass validation.
    
    Replace the WARN_ONCE with a less intrusive pr_warn_once().

    ath10k: Fix tx hanging
    
    [ Upstream commit e8a91863eba3966a447d2daa1526082d52b5db2a ]
    
    While running stress tests in roaming scenarios (switching ap's every 5
    seconds, we discovered a issue which leads to tx hangings of exactly 5
    seconds while or after scanning for new accesspoints. We found out that
    this hanging is triggered by ath10k_mac_wait_tx_complete since the
    empty_tx_wq was not wake when the num_tx_pending counter reaches zero.
    To fix this, we simply move the wake_up call to htt_tx_dec_pending,
    since this call was missed on several locations within the ath10k code.

    iwlwifi: mvm: synchronize with FW after multicast commands
    
    [ Upstream commit db66abeea3aefed481391ecc564fb7b7fb31d742 ]
    
    If userspace installs a lot of multicast groups very quickly, then
    we may run out of command queue space as we send the updates in an
    asynchronous fashion (due to locking concerns), and the CPU can
    create them faster than the firmware can process them. This is true
    even when mac80211 has a work struct that gets scheduled.
    
    Fix this by synchronizing with the firmware after sending all those
    commands - outside of the iteration we can send a synchronous echo
    command that just has the effect of the CPU waiting for the prior
    asynchronous commands to finish. This also will cause fewer of the
    commands to be sent to the firmware overall, because the work will
    only run once when rescheduled multiple times while it's running.

    media: saa7146: hexium_orion: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in hexium_attach()
    
    [ Upstream commit 348df8035301dd212e3cc2860efe4c86cb0d3303 ]
    
    In hexium_attach(dev, info), saa7146_vv_init() is called to allocate
    a new memory for dev->vv_data. In hexium_detach(), saa7146_vv_release()
    will be called and there is a dereference of dev->vv_data in
    saa7146_vv_release(), which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference
    on failure of saa7146_vv_init() according to the following logic.
    
    Both hexium_attach() and hexium_detach() are callback functions of
    the variable 'extension', so there exists a possible call chain directly
    from hexium_attach() to hexium_detach():
    
    hexium_attach(dev, info) -- fail to alloc memory to dev->vv_data
            |                               in saa7146_vv_init().
            |
            |
    hexium_detach() -- a dereference of dev->vv_data in saa7146_vv_release()
    
    Fix this bug by adding a check of saa7146_vv_init().
    
    This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
    differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
    (e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
    inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
    the callers, so they constitute bugs.
    
    Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
    positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
    the bug.
    
    Builds with CONFIG_VIDEO_HEXIUM_ORION=m show no new warnings,
    and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.

    [ Upstream commit c8ed7d2f614cd8b315981d116c7a2fb01829500d ]
    
    Some uvc devices appear to require the maximum allowed USB timeout
    for GET_CUR/SET_CUR requests.
    
    So lets just bump the UVC control timeout to 5 seconds which is the
    same as the usb ctrl get/set defaults:
    USB_CTRL_GET_TIMEOUT 5000
    USB_CTRL_SET_TIMEOUT 5000
    
    It fixes the following runtime warnings:
       Failed to query (GET_CUR) UVC control 11 on unit 2: -110 (exp. 1).
       Failed to query (SET_CUR) UVC control 3 on unit 2: -110 (exp. 2).

    In this case _STA for a MAX17047 ACPI I2C device wrongly returns 0xf and
    the _CRS resources for this device include a GpioInt pointing to a GPIO
    already in use by an _AEI handler, with a different type then specified
    in the _CRS for the MAX17047 device. Leading to the acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get()
    call done by the i2c-core-acpi.c code changing the type breaking the
    _AEI handler.
    
    Now this clearly is a bug in the DSDT of this tablet (in Android mode),
    but in general calling irq_set_irq_type() on an IRQ which already is
    in use seems like a bad idea.

    drm/bridge: megachips: Ensure both bridges are probed before registration
    
    [ Upstream commit 11632d4aa2b3f126790e81a4415d6c23103cf8bb ]
    
    In the configuration used by the b850v3, the STDP2690 is used to read EDID
    data whilst it's the STDP4028 which can detect when monitors are connected.
    
    This can result in problems at boot with monitors connected when the
    STDP4028 is probed first, a monitor is detected and an attempt is made to
    read the EDID data before the STDP2690 has probed:

    mlxsw: pci: Add shutdown method in PCI driver
    
    [ Upstream commit c1020d3cf4752f61a6a413f632ea2ce2370e150d ]
    
    On an arm64 platform with the Spectrum ASIC, after loading and executing
    a new kernel via kexec, the following trace [1] is observed. This seems
    to be caused by the fact that the device is not properly shutdown before
    executing the new kernel.
    
    Fix this by implementing a shutdown method which mirrors the remove
    method, as recommended by the kexec maintainer [2][3].

commit 2b1bdafcef74458c3b22ec0ebef0999113233619
Author: Zheyu Ma <zheyuma97@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue May 11 10:00:03 2021 +0100

    media: b2c2: Add missing check in flexcop_pci_isr:
    
    [ Upstream commit b13203032e679674c7c518f52a7ec0801ca3a829 ]
    
    A out-of-bounds bug can be triggered by an interrupt, the reason for
    this bug is the lack of checking of register values.
    
    In flexcop_pci_isr, the driver reads value from a register and uses it as
    a dma address. Finally, this address will be passed to the count parameter
    of find_next_packet. If this value is larger than the size of dma, the
    index of buffer will be out-of-bounds.
    
    Fix this by adding a check after reading the value of the register.
    
    The following KASAN report reveals it:

    usb: gadget: f_fs: Use stream_open() for endpoint files
    
    [ Upstream commit c76ef96fc00eb398c8fc836b0eb2f82bcc619dc7 ]
    
    Function fs endpoint file operations are synchronized via an interruptible
    mutex wait. However we see threads that do ep file operations concurrently
    are getting blocked for the mutex lock in __fdget_pos(). This is an
    uninterruptible wait and we see hung task warnings and kernel panic
    if hung_task_panic systcl is enabled if host does not send/receive
    the data for long time.
    
    The reason for threads getting blocked in __fdget_pos() is due to
    the file position protection introduced by the commit 9c225f2655e3
    ("vfs: atomic f_pos accesses as per POSIX"). Since function fs
    endpoint files does not have the notion of the file position, switch
    to the stream mode. This will bypass the file position mutex and
    threads will be blocked in interruptible state for the function fs
    mutex.
    
    It should not affects user space as we are only changing the task state
    changes the task state from UNINTERRUPTIBLE to INTERRUPTIBLE while waiting
    for the USB transfers to be finished. However there is a slight change to
    the O_NONBLOCK behavior. Earlier threads that are using O_NONBLOCK are also
    getting blocked inside fdget_pos(). Now they reach to function fs and error
    code is returned. The non blocking behavior is actually honoured now.

    drm/nouveau/pmu/gm200-: avoid touching PMU outside of DEVINIT/PREOS/ACR
    
    [ Upstream commit 1d2271d2fb85e54bfc9630a6c30ac0feb9ffb983 ]
    
    There have been reports of the WFI timing out on some boards, and a
    patch was proposed to just remove it.  This stuff is rather fragile,
    and I believe the WFI might be needed with our FW prior to GM200.
    
    However, we probably should not be touching PMU during init on GPUs
    where we depend on NVIDIA FW, outside of limited circumstances, so
    this should be a somewhat safer change that achieves the desired
    result.

    ar5523: Fix null-ptr-deref with unexpected WDCMSG_TARGET_START reply
    
    [ Upstream commit ae80b6033834342601e99f74f6a62ff5092b1cee ]
    
    Unexpected WDCMSG_TARGET_START replay can lead to null-ptr-deref
    when ar->tx_cmd->odata is NULL. The patch adds a null check to
    prevent such case.

    I found the bug using a custome USBFuzz port. It's a research work
    to fuzz USB stack/drivers. I modified it to fuzz ath9k driver only,
    providing hand-crafted usb descriptors to QEMU.
    
    After fixing the code (fourth byte in usb packet) to WDCMSG_TARGET_START,
    I got the null-ptr-deref bug. I believe the bug is triggerable whenever
    cmd->odata is NULL. After patching, I tested with the same input and no
    longer see the KASAN report.
    
    This was NOT tested on a real device.

    The issue is that we received a DLM message for a user lock but the
    destination lock is a kernel lock. Note that the address which is trying
    to derefence is 00000000deadbeef, which is in a kernel lock
    lkb->lkb_astparam, this field should never be derefenced by the DLM
    kernel stack. In case of a user lock lkb->lkb_astparam is lkb->lkb_ua
    (memory is shared by a union field). The struct lkb_ua will be handled
    by the DLM kernel stack but on a kernel lock it will contain invalid
    data and ends in most likely crashing the kernel.
    
    It can be reproduced with two cluster nodes.
    
    node 2:
    dlm_tool join test
    echo "862 fooobaar 1 2 1" > /sys/kernel/debug/dlm/test_locks
    echo "862 3 1" > /sys/kernel/debug/dlm/test_waiters
    
    node 1:
    dlm_tool join test
    
    python:
    foo = DLM(h_cmd=3, o_nextcmd=1, h_nodeid=1, h_lockspace=0x77222027, \
              m_type=7, m_flags=0x1, m_remid=0x862, m_result=0xFFFEFFFE)
    newFile = open("/sys/kernel/debug/dlm/comms/2/rawmsg", "wb")

    iommu/iova: Fix race between FQ timeout and teardown
    
    [ Upstream commit d7061627d701c90e1cac1e1e60c45292f64f3470 ]
    
    It turns out to be possible for hotplugging out a device to reach the
    stage of tearing down the device's group and default domain before the
    domain's flush queue has drained naturally. At this point, it is then
    possible for the timeout to expire just before the del_timer() call
    in free_iova_flush_queue(), such that we then proceed to free the FQ
    resources while fq_flush_timeout() is still accessing them on another
    CPU. Crashes due to this have been observed in the wild while removing
    NVMe devices.
    
    Close the race window by using del_timer_sync() to safely wait for any
    active timeout handler to finish before we start to free things. We
    already avoid any locking in free_iova_flush_queue() since the FQ is
    supposed to be inactive anyway, so the potential deadlock scenario does
    not apply.

    RDMA/core: Let ib_find_gid() continue search even after empty entry
    
    [ Upstream commit 483d805191a23191f8294bbf9b4e94836f5d92e4 ]
    
    Currently, ib_find_gid() will stop searching after encountering the first
    empty GID table entry. This behavior is wrong since neither IB nor RoCE
    spec enforce tightly packed GID tables.
    
    For example, when a valid GID entry exists at index N, and if a GID entry
    is empty at index N-1, ib_find_gid() will fail to find the valid entry.
    
    Fix it by making ib_find_gid() continue searching even after encountering
    missing entries.

    ext4: avoid trim error on fs with small groups
    
    [ Upstream commit 173b6e383d2a204c9921ffc1eca3b87aa2106c33 ]
    
    A user reported FITRIM ioctl failing for him on ext4 on some devices
    without apparent reason.  After some debugging we've found out that
    these devices (being LVM volumes) report rather large discard
    granularity of 42MB and the filesystem had 1k blocksize and thus group
    size of 8MB. Because ext4 FITRIM implementation puts discard
    granularity into minlen, ext4_trim_fs() declared the trim request as
    invalid. However just silently doing nothing seems to be a more
    appropriate reaction to such combination of parameters since user did
    not specify anything wrong.

    Syzbot reported uninit value in mcs7830_bind(). The problem was in
    missing validation check for bytes read via usbnet_read_cmd().
    
    usbnet_read_cmd() internally calls usb_control_msg(), that returns
    number of bytes read. Code should validate that requested number of bytes
    was actually read.
    
    So, this patch adds missing size validation check inside

    spi: spi-meson-spifc: Add missing pm_runtime_disable() in meson_spifc_probe
    
    [ Upstream commit 69c1b87516e327a60b39f96b778fe683259408bf ]
    
    If the probe fails, we should use pm_runtime_disable() to balance
    pm_runtime_enable().
    Add missing pm_runtime_disable() for meson_spifc_probe.

    fsl/fman: Check for null pointer after calling devm_ioremap
    
    [ Upstream commit d5a73ec96cc57cf67e51b12820fc2354e7ca46f8 ]
    
    As the possible failure of the allocation, the devm_ioremap() may return
    NULL pointer.
    Take tgec_initialization() as an example.
    If allocation fails, the params->base_addr will be NULL pointer and will
    be assigned to tgec->regs in tgec_config().
    Then it will cause the dereference of NULL pointer in set_mac_address(),
    which is called by tgec_init().
    Therefore, it should be better to add the sanity check after the calling
    of the devm_ioremap().

    ppp: ensure minimum packet size in ppp_write()
    
    [ Upstream commit 44073187990d5629804ce0627525f6ea5cfef171 ]
    
    It seems pretty clear ppp layer assumed user space
    would always be kind to provide enough data
    in their write() to a ppp device.
    
    This patch makes sure user provides at least
    2 bytes.
    
    It adds PPP_PROTO_LEN macro that could replace
    in net-next many occurrences of hard-coded 2 value.
    
    I replaced only one occurrence to ease backports
    to stable kernels.
    
    The bug manifests in the following report:

    sched/rt: Try to restart rt period timer when rt runtime exceeded
    
    [ Upstream commit 9b58e976b3b391c0cf02e038d53dd0478ed3013c ]
    
    When rt_runtime is modified from -1 to a valid control value, it may
    cause the task to be throttled all the time. Operations like the following
    will trigger the bug. E.g:
    
      1. echo -1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us
      2. Run a FIFO task named A that executes while(1)
      3. echo 950000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us
    
    When rt_runtime is -1, The rt period timer will not be activated when task
    A enqueued. And then the task will be throttled after setting rt_runtime to
    950,000. The task will always be throttled because the rt period timer is
    not activated.

    media: si2157: Fix "warm" tuner state detection
    
    [ Upstream commit a6441ea29cb2c9314654e093a1cd8020b9b851c8 ]
    
    Commit e955f959ac52 ("media: si2157: Better check for running tuner in
    init") completely broke the "warm" tuner detection of the si2157 driver
    due to a simple endian error: The Si2157 CRYSTAL_TRIM property code is
    0x0402 and needs to be transmitted LSB first. However, it was inserted
    MSB first, causing the warm detection to always fail and spam the kernel
    log with tuner initialization messages each time the DVB frontend
    device was closed and reopened:
    
    [  312.215682] si2157 16-0060: found a 'Silicon Labs Si2157-A30'
    [  312.264334] si2157 16-0060: firmware version: 3.0.5
    [  342.248593] si2157 16-0060: found a 'Silicon Labs Si2157-A30'

    [  372.385035] si2157 16-0060: firmware version: 3.0.5
    
    Also, the reinitializations were observed disturb _other_ tuners on
    multi-tuner cards such as the Hauppauge WinTV-QuadHD, leading to missed
    or errored packets when one of the other DVB frontend devices on that
    card was opened.
    
    Fix the order of the property code bytes to make the warm detection work
    again, also reducing the tuner initialization message in the kernel log
    to once per power-on, as well as fixing the interference with other
    tuners.

    media: dib8000: Fix a memleak in dib8000_init()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8dbdcc7269a83305ee9d677b75064d3530a48ee2 ]
    
    In dib8000_init(), the variable fe is not freed or passed out on the
    failure of dib8000_identify(&state->i2c), which could lead to a memleak.
    
    Fix this bug by adding a kfree of fe in the error path.
    
    This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
    differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
    (e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
    inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
    the callers, so they constitute bugs.
    
    Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
    positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
    the bug.

    floppy: Fix hang in watchdog when disk is ejected
    
    [ Upstream commit fb48febce7e30baed94dd791e19521abd2c3fd83 ]
    
    When the watchdog detects a disk change, it calls cancel_activity(),
    which in turn tries to cancel the fd_timer delayed work.
    
    In the above scenario, fd_timer_fn is set to fd_watchdog(), meaning
    it is trying to cancel its own work.
    This results in a hang as cancel_delayed_work_sync() is waiting for the
    watchdog (itself) to return, which never happens.
    
    This can be reproduced relatively consistently by attempting to read a
    broken floppy, and ejecting it while IO is being attempted and retried.
    
    To resolve this, this patch calls cancel_delayed_work() instead, which
    cancels the work without waiting for the watchdog to return and finish.
    
    Before this regression was introduced, the code in this section used
    del_timer(), and not del_timer_sync() to delete the watchdog timer.

    serial: amba-pl011: do not request memory region twice
    
    [ Upstream commit d1180405c7b5c7a1c6bde79d5fc24fe931430737 ]
    
    With commit 3873e2d7f63a ("drivers: PL011: refactor pl011_probe()") the
    function devm_ioremap() called from pl011_setup_port() was replaced with
    devm_ioremap_resource(). Since this function not only remaps but also
    requests the ports io memory region it now collides with the .config_port()
    callback which requests the same region at uart port registration.
    
    Since devm_ioremap_resource() already claims the memory successfully, the
    request in .config_port() fails.
    
    Later at uart port deregistration the attempt to release the unclaimed
    memory also fails. The failure results in a “Trying to free nonexistent
    resource" warning.
    
    Fix these issues by removing the callbacks that implement the redundant
    memory allocation/release. Also make sure that changing the drivers io
    memory base address via TIOCSSERIAL is not allowed any more.

    netfilter: bridge: add support for pppoe filtering
    
    [ Upstream commit 28b78ecffea8078d81466b2e01bb5a154509f1ba ]
    
    This makes 'bridge-nf-filter-pppoe-tagged' sysctl work for
    bridged traffic.
    
    Looking at the original commit it doesn't appear this ever worked:
    
     static unsigned int br_nf_post_routing(unsigned int hook, struct sk_buff **pskb,
    [..]
            if (skb->protocol == htons(ETH_P_8021Q)) {
                    skb_pull(skb, VLAN_HLEN);
                    skb->network_header += VLAN_HLEN;
    +       } else if (skb->protocol == htons(ETH_P_PPP_SES)) {
    +               skb_pull(skb, PPPOE_SES_HLEN);
    +               skb->network_header += PPPOE_SES_HLEN;
            }
     [..]
            NF_HOOK(... POST_ROUTING, ...)
    
    ... but the adjusted offsets are never restored.
    
    The alternative would be to rip this code out for good,
    but otoh we'd have to keep this anyway for the vlan handling
    (which works because vlan tag info is in the skb, not the packet
     payload).

    drivers will implement sanity checks and return errors, print a message
    so that the client will be informed that something went wrong at
    tx_submit() level.

    will result in UFA or null-ptr-deref.
    
    If dvb_register_device() in dvb_dmxdev_init() fails, fix the bug by making
    dvb_dmxdev_init() return an error as well.

    Syzbot reported slab-out-of-bounds read in hci_le_adv_report_evt(). The
    problem was in missing validaion check.
    
    We should check if data is not malicious and we can read next data block.
    If we won't check ptr validness, code can read a way beyond skb->end and
    it can cause problems, of course.

    [ Upstream commit 22be5a10d0b24eec9e45decd15d7e6112b25f080 ]
    
    In the em28xx_init_rev, if em28xx_audio_setup fails, this function fails

    Fix this by adding em28xx_unregister_media_device to free media_dev.
    
    BTW, this patch is tested in my local syzkaller instance, and it can
    prevent the memory leak from occurring again.

    clk: bcm-2835: Remove rounding up the dividers
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ca011ef4af48a7af7b15afd8a4a44039dd04cea ]
    
    The driver, once it found a divider, tries to round it up by increasing
    the least significant bit of the fractional part by one when the
    round_up argument is set and there's a remainder.
    
    However, since it increases the divider it will actually reduce the
    clock rate below what we were asking for, leading to issues with
    clk_set_min_rate() that will complain that our rounded clock rate is
    below the minimum of the rate.
    
    Since the dividers are fairly precise already, let's remove that part so
    that we can have clk_set_min_rate() working.
    
    This is effectively a revert of 9c95b32ca093 ("clk: bcm2835: add a round
    up ability to the clock divisor").

    The driver currently tries to pick the closest rate that is lower than
    the rate being requested.
    
    This causes an issue with clk_set_min_rate() since it actively checks
    for the rounded rate to be above the minimum that was just set.

    PCI: Add function 1 DMA alias quirk for Marvell 88SE9125 SATA controller
    
    commit e445375882883f69018aa669b67cbb37ec873406 upstream.
    
    Like other SATA controller chips in the Marvell 88SE91xx series, the
    Marvell 88SE9125 has the same DMA requester ID hardware bug that prevents
    it from working under IOMMU.  Add it to the list of devices that need the
    quirk.
    
    Without this patch, device initialization fails with DMA errors:
    
      ata8: softreset failed (1st FIS failed)
      DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 2
      DMAR: [DMA Write NO_PASID] Request device [03:00.1] fault addr 0xfffc0000 [fault reason 0x02] Present bit in context entry is clear

    Fix a data race in commit 779750d20b93 ("shmem: split huge pages beyond

         entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x3d/0xa2
    
    A simple explanation:
    
    Image there are 3 items in the local list (@list).  In the first
    traversal, A is not deleted from @list.
    
      1)    A->B->C
            ^
            |
            pos (leave)
    
    In the second traversal, B is deleted from @list.  Concurrently, A is
    deleted from @list through shmem_evict_inode() since last reference
    counter of inode is dropped by other thread.  Then the @list is corrupted.
    
      2)    A->B->C
            ^  ^
            |  |
         evict pos (drop)
    
    We should make sure the inode is either on the global list or deleted from
    any local list before iput().
    
    Fixed by moving inodes back to global list before we put them.

    media: dib0700: fix undefined behavior in tuner shutdown
    
    commit f7b77ebe6d2f49c7747b2d619586d1aa33f9ea91 upstream.
    
    This fixes a problem where closing the tuner would leave it in a state
    where it would not tune to any channel when reopened. This problem was
    discovered as part of https://github.com/hselasky/webcamd/issues/16.
    
    Since adap->id is 0 or 1, this bit-shift overflows, which is undefined
    behavior. The driver still worked in practice as the overflow would in
    most environments result in 0, which rendered the line a no-op. When
    running the driver as part of webcamd however, the overflow could lead
    to 0xff due to optimizations by the compiler, which would, in the end,
    improperly shut down the tuner.
    
    The bug is a regression introduced in the commit referenced below. The
    present patch causes identical behavior to before that commit for
    adap->id equal to 0 or 1. The driver does not contain support for
    dib0700 devices with more adapters, assuming such even exist.
    
    Tests have been performed with the Xbox One Digital TV Tuner on amd64.
    Not all dib0700 devices are expected to be affected by the regression;
    this code path is only taken by those with incorrect endpoint numbers.

    rtc: cmos: take rtc_lock while reading from CMOS
    
    commit 454f47ff464325223129b9b5b8d0b61946ec704d upstream.
    
    Reading from the CMOS involves writing to the index register and then
    reading from the data register. Therefore access to the CMOS has to be
    serialized with rtc_lock. This invocation of CMOS_READ was not
    serialized, which could cause trouble when other code is accessing CMOS
    at the same time.
    
    Use spin_lock_irq() like the rest of the function.
    
    Nothing in kernel modifies the RTC_DM_BINARY bit, so there could be a
    separate pair of spin_lock_irq() / spin_unlock_irq() before doing the
    math.

    nfc: llcp: fix NULL error pointer dereference on sendmsg() after failed bind()
    
    commit dded08927ca3c31a5c37f8e7f95fe98770475dd4 upstream.
    
    Syzbot detected a NULL pointer dereference of nfc_llcp_sock->dev pointer
    (which is a 'struct nfc_dev *') with calls to llcp_sock_sendmsg() after
    a failed llcp_sock_bind(). The message being sent is a SOCK_DGRAM.
    
    KASAN report:

       ____sys_sendmsg+0x253/0x3f0
       ...
    
    The issue was visible only with multiple simultaneous calls to bind() and
    sendmsg(), which resulted in most of the bind() calls to fail.  The
    bind() was failing on checking if there is available WKS/SDP/SAP
    (respective bit in 'struct nfc_llcp_local' fields).  When there was no
    available WKS/SDP/SAP, the bind returned error but the sendmsg() to such
    socket was able to trigger mentioned NULL pointer dereference of
    nfc_llcp_sock->dev.
    
    The code looks simply racy and currently it protects several paths
    against race with checks for (!nfc_llcp_sock->local) which is NULL-ified
    in error paths of bind().  The llcp_sock_sendmsg() did not have such
    check but called function nfc_llcp_send_ui_frame() had, although not
    protected with lock_sock().
    
    Therefore the race could look like (same socket is used all the time):
      CPU0                                     CPU1
      ====                                     ====
      llcp_sock_bind()
      - lock_sock()
        - success
      - release_sock()
      - return 0
                                               llcp_sock_sendmsg()
                                               - lock_sock()
                                               - release_sock()
      llcp_sock_bind(), same socket
      - lock_sock()
        - error
                                               - nfc_llcp_send_ui_frame()
                                                 - if (!llcp_sock->local)
        - llcp_sock->local = NULL
        - nfc_put_device(dev)
                                                 - dereference llcp_sock->dev
      - release_sock()
      - return -ERRNO
    
    The nfc_llcp_send_ui_frame() checked llcp_sock->local outside of the
    lock, which is racy and ineffective check.  Instead, its caller
    llcp_sock_sendmsg(), should perform the check inside lock_sock().

    HID: wacom: Avoid using stale array indicies to read contact count
    
    commit 20f3cf5f860f9f267a6a6e5642d3d0525edb1814 upstream.
    
    If we ever see a touch report with contact count data we initialize
    several variables used to read the contact count in the pre-report
    phase. These variables are never reset if we process a report which
    doesn't contain a contact count, however. This can cause the pre-
    report function to trigger a read of arbitrary memory (e.g. NULL
    if we're lucky) and potentially crash the driver.
    
    This commit restores resetting of the variables back to default
    "none" values that were used prior to the commit mentioned
    below.

    HID: wacom: Ignore the confidence flag when a touch is removed
    
    commit df03e9bd6d4806619b4cdc91a3d7695818a8e2b7 upstream.
    
    AES hardware may internally re-classify a contact that it thought was
    intentional as a palm. Intentional contacts are reported as "down" with
    the confidence bit set. When this re-classification occurs, however, the
    state transitions to "up" with the confidence bit cleared. This kind of
    transition appears to be legal according to Microsoft docs, but we do
    not handle it correctly. Because the confidence bit is clear, we don't
    call `wacom_wac_finger_slot` and update userspace. This causes hung
    touches that confuse userspace and interfere with pen arbitration.
    
    This commit adds a special case to ignore the confidence flag if a contact
    is reported as removed. This ensures we do not leave a hung touch if one
    of these re-classification events occured. Ideally we'd have some way to
    also let userspace know that the touch has been re-classified as a palm
    and needs to be canceled, but that's not possible right now :)

    HID: uhid: Fix worker destroying device without any protection
    
    commit 4ea5763fb79ed89b3bdad455ebf3f33416a81624 upstream.
    
    uhid has to run hid_add_device() from workqueue context while allowing
    parallel use of the userspace API (which is protected with ->devlock).
    But hid_add_device() can fail. Currently, that is handled by immediately
    destroying the associated HID device, without using ->devlock - but if
    there are concurrent requests from userspace, that's wrong and leads to
    NULL dereferences and/or memory corruption (via use-after-free).
    
    Fix it by leaving the HID device as-is in the worker. We can clean it up
    later, either in the UHID_DESTROY command handler or in the ->release()
    handler.

    Bluetooth: fix init and cleanup of sco_conn.timeout_work
    
    commit 49d8a5606428ca0962d09050a5af81461ff90fbb upstream.
    
    Before freeing struct sco_conn, all delayed timeout work should be
    cancelled. Otherwise, sco_sock_timeout could potentially use the
    sco_conn after it has been freed.
    
    Additionally, sco_conn.timeout_work should be initialized when the
    connection is allocated, not when the channel is added. This is
    because an sco_conn can create channels with multiple sockets over its
    lifetime, which happens if sockets are released but the connection
    isn't deleted.

    Bluetooth: schedule SCO timeouts with delayed_work
    
    commit ba316be1b6a00db7126ed9a39f9bee434a508043 upstream.
    
    struct sock.sk_timer should be used as a sock cleanup timer. However,
    SCO uses it to implement sock timeouts.
    
    This causes issues because struct sock.sk_timer's callback is run in
    an IRQ context, and the timer callback function sco_sock_timeout takes
    a spin lock on the socket. However, other functions such as
    sco_conn_del and sco_conn_ready take the spin lock with interrupts
    enabled.
    
    This inconsistent {SOFTIRQ-ON-W} -> {IN-SOFTIRQ-W} lock usage could
    lead to deadlocks as reported by Syzbot [1]:
           CPU0
           ----
      lock(slock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_SCO);
      <Interrupt>
        lock(slock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_SCO);
    
    To fix this, we use delayed work to implement SCO sock timouts
    instead. This allows us to avoid taking the spin lock on the socket in
    an IRQ context, and corrects the misuse of struct sock.sk_timer.
    
    As a note, cancel_delayed_work is used instead of
    cancel_delayed_work_sync in sco_sock_set_timer and
    sco_sock_clear_timer to avoid a deadlock. In the future, the call to
    bh_lock_sock inside sco_sock_timeout should be changed to lock_sock to
    synchronize with other functions using lock_sock. However, since
    sco_sock_set_timer and sco_sock_clear_timer are sometimes called under
    the locked socket (in sco_connect and __sco_sock_close),
    cancel_delayed_work_sync might cause them to sleep until an
    sco_sock_timeout that has started finishes running. But
    sco_sock_timeout would also sleep until it can grab the lock_sock.
    
    Using cancel_delayed_work is fine because sco_sock_timeout does not
    change from run to run, hence there is no functional difference
    between:
    1. waiting for a timeout to finish running before scheduling another
    timeout
    2. scheduling another timeout while a timeout is running.

    and enables local interrupts. The problem is that it restores the flags
    at the end without disabling local interrupts first.

    media: uvcvideo: fix division by zero at stream start
    
    commit 8aa637bf6d70d2fb2ad4d708d8b9dd02b1c095df upstream.
    
    Add the missing bulk-endpoint max-packet sanity check to
    uvc_video_start_transfer() to avoid division by zero in
    uvc_alloc_urb_buffers() in case a malicious device has broken
    descriptors (or when doing descriptor fuzz testing).
    
    Note that USB core will reject URBs submitted for endpoints with zero
    wMaxPacketSize but that drivers doing packet-size calculations still
    need to handle this (cf. commit 2548288b4fb0 ("USB: Fix: Don't skip
    endpoint descriptors with maxpacket=0")).

    orangefs: Fix the size of a memory allocation in orangefs_bufmap_alloc()
    
    commit 40a74870b2d1d3d44e13b3b73c6571dd34f5614d upstream.
    
    'buffer_index_array' really looks like a bitmap. So it should be allocated
    as such.
    When kzalloc is called, a number of bytes is expected, but a number of
    longs is passed instead.
    
    In get(), if not enough memory is allocated, un-allocated memory may be
    read or written.
    
    So use bitmap_zalloc() to safely allocate the correct memory size and
    avoid un-expected behavior.
    
    While at it, change the corresponding kfree() into bitmap_free() to keep
    the semantic.

    drm/i915: Avoid bitwise vs logical OR warning in snb_wm_latency_quirk()
    
    commit 2e70570656adfe1c5d9a29940faa348d5f132199 upstream.
    
    A new warning in clang points out a place in this file where a bitwise
    OR is being used with boolean types:
    
    drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_pm.c:3066:12: warning: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
            changed = ilk_increase_wm_latency(dev_priv, dev_priv->wm.pri_latency, 12) |
                      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    This construct is intentional, as it allows every one of the calls to
    ilk_increase_wm_latency() to occur (instead of short circuiting with
    logical OR) while still caring about the result of each call.
    
    To make this clearer to the compiler, use the '|=' operator to assign
    the result of each ilk_increase_wm_latency() call to changed, which
    keeps the meaning of the code the same but makes it obvious that every
    one of these calls is expected to happen.

    staging: wlan-ng: Avoid bitwise vs logical OR warning in hfa384x_usb_throttlefn()
    
    commit 502408a61f4b7eb4713f44bd77f4a48e6cb1b59a upstream.
    
    A new warning in clang points out a place in this file where a bitwise
    OR is being used with boolean expressions:
    
    In file included from drivers/staging/wlan-ng/prism2usb.c:2:

    1 warning generated.
    
    The comment explains that short circuiting here is undesirable, as the
    calls to test_and_{clear,set}_bit() need to happen for both sides of the
    expression.
    
    Clang's suggestion would work to silence the warning but the readability
    of the expression would suffer even more. To clean up the warning and
    make the block more readable, use a variable for each side of the
    bitwise expression.

    random: fix data race on crng init time
    
    commit 009ba8568be497c640cab7571f7bfd18345d7b24 upstream.
    
    _extract_crng() does plain loads of crng->init_time and
    crng_global_init_time, which causes undefined behavior if
    crng_reseed() and RNDRESEEDCRNG modify these corrently.
    
    Use READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() to make the behavior defined.
    
    Don't fix the race on crng->init_time by protecting it with crng->lock,
    since it's not a problem for duplicate reseedings to occur.  I.e., the
    lockless access with READ_ONCE() is fine.

    commit 5d73d1e320c3fd94ea15ba5f79301da9a8bcc7de upstream.
    
    extract_crng() and crng_backtrack_protect() load crng_node_pool with a
    plain load, which causes undefined behavior if do_numa_crng_init()
    modifies it concurrently.
    
    Fix this by using READ_ONCE().  Note: as per the previous discussion
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20211219025139.31085-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/T/#u,
    READ_ONCE() is believed to be sufficient here, and it was requested that
    it be used here instead of smp_load_acquire().
    
    Also change do_numa_crng_init() to set crng_node_pool using
    cmpxchg_release() instead of mb() + cmpxchg(), as the former is
    sufficient here but is more lightweight.

    USB: Fix "slab-out-of-bounds Write" bug in usb_hcd_poll_rh_status
    
    commit 1d7d4c07932e04355d6e6528d44a2f2c9e354346 upstream.
    
    When the USB core code for getting root-hub status reports was
    originally written, it was assumed that the hub driver would be its
    only caller.  But this isn't true now; user programs can use usbfs to
    communicate with root hubs and get status reports.  When they do this,
    they may use a transfer_buffer that is smaller than the data returned
    by the HCD, which will lead to a buffer overflow error when
    usb_hcd_poll_rh_status() tries to store the status data.  This was
    discovered by syzbot:
    
    BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in memcpy include/linux/fortify-string.h:225 [inline]
    BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in usb_hcd_poll_rh_status+0x5f4/0x780 drivers/usb/core/hcd.c:776
    Write of size 2 at addr ffff88801da403c0 by task syz-executor133/4062
    
    This patch fixes the bug by reducing the amount of status data if it
    won't fit in the transfer_buffer.  If some data gets discarded then
    the URB's completion status is set to -EOVERFLOW rather than 0, to let
    the user know what happened.

    USB: core: Fix bug in resuming hub's handling of wakeup requests
    
    commit 0f663729bb4afc92a9986b66131ebd5b8a9254d1 upstream.
    
    Bugzilla #213839 reports a 7-port hub that doesn't work properly when
    devices are plugged into some of the ports; the kernel goes into an
    unending disconnect/reinitialize loop as shown in the bug report.
    
    This "7-port hub" comprises two four-port hubs with one plugged into
    the other; the failures occur when a device is plugged into one of the
    downstream hub's ports.  (These hubs have other problems too.  For
    example, they bill themselves as USB-2.0 compliant but they only run
    at full speed.)
    
    It turns out that the failures are caused by bugs in both the kernel
    and the hub.  The hub's bug is that it reports a different
    bmAttributes value in its configuration descriptor following a remote
    wakeup (0xe0 before, 0xc0 after -- the wakeup-support bit has
    changed).
    
    The kernel's bug is inside the hub driver's resume handler.  When
    hub_activate() sees that one of the hub's downstream ports got a
    wakeup request from a child device, it notes this fact by setting the
    corresponding bit in the hub->change_bits variable.  But this variable
    is meant for connection changes, not wakeup events; setting it causes
    the driver to believe the downstream port has been disconnected and
    then connected again (in addition to having received a wakeup
    request).
    
    Because of this, the hub driver then tries to check whether the device
    currently plugged into the downstream port is the same as the device
    that had been attached there before.  Normally this check succeeds and
    wakeup handling continues with no harm done (which is why the bug
    remained undetected until now).  But with these dodgy hubs, the check
    fails because the config descriptor has changed.  This causes the hub
    driver to reinitialize the child device, leading to the
    disconnect/reinitialize loop described in the bug report.
    
    The proper way to note reception of a downstream wakeup request is
    to set a bit in the hub->event_bits variable instead of
    hub->change_bits.  That way the hub driver will realize that something
    has happened to the port but will not think the port and child device
    have been disconnected.  This patch makes that change.

    Bluetooth: bfusb: fix division by zero in send path
    
    commit b5e6fa7a12572c82f1e7f2f51fbb02a322291291 upstream.

    broken descriptors (or when doing descriptor fuzz testing).
    
    Note that USB core will reject URBs submitted for endpoints with zero
