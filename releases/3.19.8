    clk: at91: usb: fix determine_rate prototype
    
    Commit c67881fc890916206e723329e774391c6ed354ce is a backport of
    0b67c43ce36a9964f1d5e3f973ee19eefd3f9f8f upstream commit, fixing a
    bug on clk rate change propagation.
    But in 4.0 ->determine_rate() prototype has changed, thus introducing
    a prototype mismatch when applying it on 3.19.

    If we don't do that, then the poison value is left in the ->pprev
    backlink.
    
    This can cause crashes if we do a disconnect, followed by a connect().

    net/mlx4_en: Schedule napi when RX buffers allocation fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 07841f9d94c11afe00c0498cf242edf4075729f4 ]
    
    When system is out of memory, refilling of RX buffers fails while
    the driver continue to pass the received packets to the kernel stack.
    At some point, when all RX buffers deplete, driver may fall into a
    sleep, and not recover when memory for new RX buffers is once again
    availible. This is because hardware does not have valid descriptors,
    so no interrupt will be generated for the driver to return to work
    in napi context. Fix it by schedule the napi poll function from
    stats_task delayed workqueue, as long as the allocations fail.

    cxgb4: Fix MC1 memory offset calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit 7f0b8a56c978b0a3315ac84c6cbb065413afb8e9 ]
    
    Commit 6559a7e8296002b4 ("cxgb4: Cleanup macros so they follow the same
    style and look consistent") introduced a regression where reading MC1
    memory in adapters where MC0 isn't present or MC0 size is not equal to MC1
    size caused the adapter to crash due to incorrect computation of memoffset.
    Fix is to read the size of MC0 instead of MC1 for offset calculation

    mlx4: Fix tx ring affinity_mask creation
    
    [ Upstream commit 42eab005a5dd5d7ea2b0328aecc4d6cc0c23c9c2 ]
    
    By default, the number of tx queues is limited by the number of online cpus
    in mlx4_en_get_profile(). However, this limit no longer holds after the
    ethtool .set_channels method has been called. In that situation, the driver
    may access invalid bits of certain cpumask variables when queue_index >=
    nr_cpu_ids.

    route: Use ipv4_mtu instead of raw rt_pmtu
    
    [ Upstream commit cb6ccf09d6b94bec4def1ac5cf4678d12b216474 ]
    
    The commit 3cdaa5be9e81a914e633a6be7b7d2ef75b528562 ("ipv4: Don't
    increase PMTU with Datagram Too Big message") broke PMTU in cases
    where the rt_pmtu value has expired but is smaller than the new
    PMTU value.
    
    This obsolete rt_pmtu then prevents the new PMTU value from being
    installed.

    bpf: fix 64-bit divide
    
    [ Upstream commit 876a7ae65b86d8cec8efe7d15d050ac61116874e ]
    
    ALU64_DIV instruction should be dividing 64-bit by 64-bit,
    whereas do_div() does 64-bit by 32-bit divide.
    x64 and arm64 JITs correctly implement 64 by 64 unsigned divide.
    llvm BPF backend emits code assuming that ALU64_DIV does 64 by 64.
