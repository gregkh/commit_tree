    HID: uhid: forbid UHID_CREATE under KERNEL_DS or elevated privileges
    
    commit 8c01db7619f07c85c5cd81ec5eb83608b56c88f5 upstream.
    
    When a UHID_CREATE command is written to the uhid char device, a
    copy_from_user() is done from a user pointer embedded in the command.
    When the address limit is KERNEL_DS, e.g. as is the case during
    sys_sendfile(), this can read from kernel memory.  Alternatively,
    information can be leaked from a setuid binary that is tricked to write
    to the file descriptor.  Therefore, forbid UHID_CREATE in these cases.
    
    No other commands in uhid_char_write() are affected by this bug and
    UHID_CREATE is marked as "obsolete", so apply the restriction to
    UHID_CREATE only rather than to uhid_char_write() entirely.
    
    Thanks to Dmitry Vyukov for adding uhid definitions to syzkaller and to
    Jann Horn for commit 9da3f2b740544 ("x86/fault: BUG() when uaccess
    helpers fault on kernel addresses"), allowing this bug to be found.

    ACPI / platform: Add SMB0001 HID to forbidden_id_list
    
    commit 2bbb5fa37475d7aa5fa62f34db1623f3da2dfdfa upstream.
    
    Many HP AMD based laptops contain an SMB0001 device like this:
    
    Device (SMBD)
    {
        Name (_HID, "SMB0001")  // _HID: Hardware ID
        Name (_CRS, ResourceTemplate ()  // _CRS: Current Resource Settings
        {
            IO (Decode16,
                0x0B20,             // Range Minimum
                0x0B20,             // Range Maximum
                0x20,               // Alignment
                0x20,               // Length
                )
            IRQ (Level, ActiveLow, Shared, )
                {7}
        })
    }
    
    The legacy style IRQ resource here causes acpi_dev_get_irqresource() to
    be called with legacy=true and this message to show in dmesg:
    ACPI: IRQ 7 override to edge, high
    
    This causes issues when later on the AMD0030 GPIO device gets enumerated:
    
    Device (GPIO)
    {
        Name (_HID, "AMDI0030")  // _HID: Hardware ID
        Name (_CID, "AMDI0030")  // _CID: Compatible ID
        Name (_UID, Zero)  // _UID: Unique ID
        Method (_CRS, 0, NotSerialized)  // _CRS: Current Resource Settings
        {
            Name (RBUF, ResourceTemplate ()
            {
                Interrupt (ResourceConsumer, Level, ActiveLow, Shared, ,, )
                {
                    0x00000007,
                }
                Memory32Fixed (ReadWrite,
                    0xFED81500,         // Address Base
                    0x00000400,         // Address Length
                    )
            })
            Return (RBUF) /* \_SB_.GPIO._CRS.RBUF */
        }
    }
    
    Now acpi_dev_get_irqresource() gets called with legacy=false, but because
    of the earlier override of the trigger-type acpi_register_gsi() returns
    -EBUSY (because we try to register the same interrupt with a different
    trigger-type) and we end up setting IORESOURCE_DISABLED in the flags.
    
    The setting of IORESOURCE_DISABLED causes platform_get_irq() to call
    acpi_irq_get() which is not implemented on x86 and returns -EINVAL.
    resulting in the following in dmesg:
    
    amd_gpio AMDI0030:00: Failed to get gpio IRQ: -22
    amd_gpio: probe of AMDI0030:00 failed with error -22
    
    The SMB0001 is a "virtual" device in the sense that the only way the OS
    interacts with it is through calling a couple of methods to do SMBus
    transfers. As such it is weird that it has IO and IRQ resources at all,
    because the driver for it is not expected to ever access the hardware
    directly.
    
    The Linux driver for the SMB0001 device directly binds to the acpi_device
    through the acpi_bus, so we do not need to instantiate a platform_device
    for this ACPI device. This commit adds the SMB0001 HID to the
    forbidden_id_list, avoiding the instantiating of a platform_device for it.
    Not instantiating a platform_device means we will no longer call
    acpi_dev_get_irqresource() for the legacy IRQ resource fixing the probe of
    the AMDI0030 device failing.

    misc: atmel-ssc: Fix section annotation on atmel_ssc_get_driver_data
    
    commit 7c97301285b62a41d6bceded7d964085fc8cc50f upstream.
    
    After building the kernel with Clang, the following section mismatch
    warning appears:
    
    WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x3bf19a6): Section mismatch in reference from
    the function ssc_probe() to the function
    .init.text:atmel_ssc_get_driver_data()
    The function ssc_probe() references
    the function __init atmel_ssc_get_driver_data().
    This is often because ssc_probe lacks a __init
    annotation or the annotation of atmel_ssc_get_driver_data is wrong.
    
    Remove __init from atmel_ssc_get_driver_data to get rid of the mismatch.

    USB: quirks: Add no-lpm quirk for Raydium touchscreens
    
    commit deefd24228a172d1b27d4a9adbfd2cdacd60ae64 upstream.
    
    Raydium USB touchscreen fails to set config if LPM is enabled:
    [    2.030658] usb 1-8: New USB device found, idVendor=2386, idProduct=3119
    [    2.030659] usb 1-8: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
    [    2.030660] usb 1-8: Product: Raydium Touch System

    [    7.132209] usb 1-8: can't set config #1, error -110
    
    Same behavior can be observed on 2386:3114.
    
    Raydium claims the touchscreen supports LPM under Windows, so I used
    Microsoft USB Test Tools (MUTT) [1] to check its LPM status. MUTT shows
    that the LPM doesn't work under Windows, either. So let's just disable LPM
    for Raydium touchscreens.

    uio: Fix an Oops on load
    
    commit 432798195bbce1f8cd33d1c0284d0538835e25fb upstream.
    
    I was trying to solve a double free but I introduced a more serious
    NULL dereference bug.  The problem is that if there is an IRQ which
    triggers immediately, then we need "info->uio_dev" but it's not set yet.
    
    This patch puts the original initialization back to how it was and just
    sets info->uio_dev to NULL on the error path so it should solve both
    the Oops and the double free.

    Patch ad608fbcf166 changed how events were subscribed to address an issue
    elsewhere. As a side effect of that change, the "add" callback was called
    before the event subscription was added to the list of subscribed events,
    causing the first event queued by the add callback (and possibly other
    events arriving soon afterwards) to be lost.
    
    Fix this by adding the subscription to the list before calling the "add"
    callback, and clean up afterwards if that fails.

    v4.20 kernel fixes it by [1, 2] but it's too large size to merge
    into -stable so this patch fixes the problem by registering defualt
    group by Greg KH's approach[3].
    
    This patch should be applied to every stable tree [3.16+] currently

    [ Upstream commit b33228029d842269e17bba591609e83ed422005d ]
    
    Ensure that clocks for core SoC modules (including TZPC0..9 modules)
    are enabled for suspend/resume cycle. This fixes suspend/resume
    support on Exynos5422-based Odroid XU3/XU4 boards.

    um: Give start_idle_thread() a return code
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ff1e34bbdc15acab823b1ee4240e94623d50ee8 ]
    
    Fixes:
    arch/um/os-Linux/skas/process.c:613:1: warning: control reaches end of
    non-void function [-Wreturn-type]
    
    longjmp() never returns but gcc still warns that the end of the function
    can be reached.
    Add a return code and debug aid to detect this impossible case.

    hfsplus: prevent btree data loss on root split
    
    [ Upstream commit 0a3021d4f5295aa073c7bf5c5e4de60a2e292578 ]
    
    Creating, renaming or deleting a file may cause catalog corruption and
    data loss.  This bug is randomly triggered by xfstests generic/027, but
    here is a faster reproducer:
    
      truncate -s 50M fs.iso
      mkfs.hfsplus fs.iso
      mount fs.iso /mnt
      i=100
      while [ $i -le 150 ]; do
        touch /mnt/$i &>/dev/null
        ((++i))
      done
      i=100
      while [ $i -le 150 ]; do
        mv /mnt/$i /mnt/$(perl -e "print $i x82") &>/dev/null
        ((++i))
      done
      umount /mnt
      fsck.hfsplus -n fs.iso
    
    The bug is triggered whenever hfs_brec_update_parent() needs to split the
    root node.  The height of the btree is not increased, which leaves the new
    node orphaned and its records lost.

    hfs: prevent btree data loss on root split
    
    [ Upstream commit d057c036672f33d43a5f7344acbb08cf3a8a0c09 ]
    
    This bug is triggered whenever hfs_brec_update_parent() needs to split
    the root node.  The height of the btree is not increased, which leaves
    the new node orphaned and its records lost.  It is not possible for this
    to happen on a valid hfs filesystem because the index nodes have fixed
    length keys.
    
    For reasons I ignore, the hfs module does have support for a number of
    hfsplus features.  A corrupt btree header may report variable length
    keys and trigger this bug, so it's better to fix it.

    reiserfs: propagate errors from fill_with_dentries() properly
    
    [ Upstream commit b10298d56c9623f9b173f19959732d3184b35f4f ]
    
    fill_with_dentries() failed to propagate errors up to
    reiserfs_for_each_xattr() properly.  Plumb them through.
    
    Note that reiserfs_for_each_xattr() is only used by
    reiserfs_delete_xattrs() and reiserfs_chown_xattrs().  The result of
    reiserfs_delete_xattrs() is discarded anyway, the only difference there is
    whether a warning is printed to dmesg.  The result of
    reiserfs_chown_xattrs() does matter because it can block chowning of the
    file to which the xattrs belong; but either way, the resulting state can
    have misaligned ownership, so my patch doesn't improve things greatly.
    
    Credit for making me look at this code goes to Al Viro, who pointed out
    that the ->actor calling convention is suboptimal and should be changed.

    net-gro: reset skb->pkt_type in napi_reuse_skb()
    
    [ Upstream commit 33d9a2c72f086cbf1087b2fd2d1a15aa9df14a7f ]
    
    eth_type_trans() assumes initial value for skb->pkt_type
    is PACKET_HOST.
    
    This is indeed the value right after a fresh skb allocation.
    
    However, it is possible that GRO merged a packet with a different
    value (like PACKET_OTHERHOST in case macvlan is used), so
    we need to make sure napi->skb will have pkt_type set back to
    PACKET_HOST.
    
    Otherwise, valid packets might be dropped by the stack because
    their pkt_type is not PACKET_HOST.
    
    napi_reuse_skb() was added in commit 96e93eab2033 ("gro: Add
    internal interfaces for VLAN"), but this bug always has
    been there.
