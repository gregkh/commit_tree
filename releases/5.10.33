    USB: CDC-ACM: fix poison/unpoison imbalance
    
    commit a8b3b519618f30a87a304c4e120267ce6f8dc68a upstream.
    
    suspend() does its poisoning conditionally, resume() does it
    unconditionally. On a device with combined interfaces this
    will balance, on a device with two interfaces the counter will
    go negative and resubmission will fail.
    
    Both actions need to be done conditionally.

    introduced an unconditional NULL-pointer dereference on every disconnect
    instead.
    
    Specifically, the serial device table must no longer be accessed after
    the minor has been released by hso_serial_tty_unregister().

    x86/crash: Fix crash_setup_memmap_entries() out-of-bounds access
    
    commit 5849cdf8c120e3979c57d34be55b92d90a77a47e upstream.
    
    Commit in Fixes: added support for kexec-ing a kernel on panic using a
    new system call. As part of it, it does prepare a memory map for the new
    kernel.
    
    However, while doing so, it wrongly accesses memory it has not
    allocated: it accesses the first element of the cmem->ranges[] array in
    memmap_exclude_ranges() but it has not allocated the memory for it in
    crash_setup_memmap_entries(). As KASAN reports:

    ia64: fix discontig.c section mismatches
    
    [ Upstream commit e2af9da4f867a1a54f1252bf3abc1a5c63951778 ]
    
    Fix IA64 discontig.c Section mismatch warnings.
    
    When CONFIG_SPARSEMEM=y and CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG=y, the functions
    computer_pernodesize() and scatter_node_data() should not be marked as
    __meminit because they are needed after init, on any memory hotplug
    event.  Also, early_nr_cpus_node() is called by compute_pernodesize(),
    so early_nr_cpus_node() cannot be __meminit either.
    
      WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(.text.unlikely+0x1612): Section mismatch in reference from the function arch_alloc_nodedata() to the function .meminit.text:compute_pernodesize()
      The function arch_alloc_nodedata() references the function __meminit compute_pernodesize().
      This is often because arch_alloc_nodedata lacks a __meminit annotation or the annotation of compute_pernodesize is wrong.
    
      WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(.text.unlikely+0x1692): Section mismatch in reference from the function arch_refresh_nodedata() to the function .meminit.text:scatter_node_data()
      The function arch_refresh_nodedata() references the function __meminit scatter_node_data().
      This is often because arch_refresh_nodedata lacks a __meminit annotation or the annotation of scatter_node_data is wrong.

    The symbol in e1000 has been around longer, so change arch/csky/ to use
    DRAM_BASE instead of RAM_BASE to remove the conflict.  (although e1000
    is also a 2-line change)

    kasan: fix hwasan build for gcc
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c595ac4c776c44b5c59de22ab43b3fe256d9fbb ]
    
    gcc-11 adds support for -fsanitize=kernel-hwaddress, so it becomes
    possible to enable CONFIG_KASAN_SW_TAGS.
    
    Unfortunately this fails to build at the moment, because the
    corresponding command line arguments use llvm specific syntax.
    
    Change it to use the cc-param macro instead, which works on both clang
    and gcc.

    xen-netback: Check for hotplug-status existence before watching
    
    [ Upstream commit 2afeec08ab5c86ae21952151f726bfe184f6b23d ]
    
    The logic in connect() is currently written with the assumption that
    xenbus_watch_pathfmt() will return an error for a node that does not
    exist.  This assumption is incorrect: xenstore does allow a watch to
    be registered for a nonexistent node (and will send notifications
    should the node be subsequently created).
    
    As of commit 1f2565780 ("xen-netback: remove 'hotplug-status' once it
    has served its purpose"), this leads to a failure when a domU
    transitions into XenbusStateConnected more than once.  On the first
    domU transition into Connected state, the "hotplug-status" node will
    be deleted by the hotplug_status_changed() callback in dom0.  On the
    second or subsequent domU transition into Connected state, the
    hotplug_status_changed() callback will therefore never be invoked, and
    so the backend will remain stuck in InitWait.
    
    This failure prevents scenarios such as reloading the xen-netfront
    module within a domU, or booting a domU via iPXE.  There is
    unfortunately no way for the domU to work around this dom0 bug.
    
    Fix by explicitly checking for existence of the "hotplug-status" node,
    thereby creating the behaviour that was previously assumed to exist.

    arm64: kprobes: Restore local irqflag if kprobes is cancelled
    
    [ Upstream commit 738fa58ee1328481d1d7889e7c430b3401c571b9 ]
    
    If instruction being single stepped caused a page fault, the kprobes
    is cancelled to let the page fault handler continue as a normal page
    fault. But the local irqflags are disabled so cpu will restore pstate
    with DAIF masked. After pagefault is serviced, the kprobes is
    triggerred again, we overwrite the saved_irqflag by calling
    kprobes_save_local_irqflag(). NOTE, DAIF is masked in this new saved
    irqflag. After kprobes is serviced, the cpu pstate is retored with
    DAIF masked.
    
    This patch is inspired by one patch for riscv from Liao Chang.

    s390/entry: save the caller of psw_idle
    
    [ Upstream commit a994eddb947ea9ebb7b14d9a1267001699f0a136 ]
    
    Currently psw_idle does not allocate a stack frame and does not
    save its r14 and r15 into the save area. Even though this is valid from
    call ABI point of view, because psw_idle does not make any calls
    explicitly, in reality psw_idle is an entry point for controlled
    transition into serving interrupts. So, in practice, psw_idle stack
    frame is analyzed during stack unwinding. Depending on build options
    that r14 slot in the save area of psw_idle might either contain a value
    saved by previous sibling call or complete garbage.

    [ Upstream commit 917a3200b9f467a154999c7572af345f2470aaf4 ]
    
    pm_runtime_get_sync() will increase the runtime PM counter
    even it returns an error. Thus a pairing decrement is needed
    to prevent refcount leak. Fix this by replacing this API with
    pm_runtime_resume_and_get(), which will not change the runtime
    PM counter on error.

    Currently, GENI devices like i2c-qcom-geni fails to probe in ACPI boot,

    only supports DT right now.  As interconnect is not necessarily required
    for basic function of GENI devices, let's shield geni_icc_get() call,
    and then all other ICC calls become nop due to NULL icc_path, so that
    GENI devices keep working for ACPI boot.

    perf/x86/kvm: Fix Broadwell Xeon stepping in isolation_ucodes[]
    
    [ Upstream commit 4b2f1e59229b9da319d358828cdfa4ddbc140769 ]
    
    The only stepping of Broadwell Xeon parts is stepping 1. Fix the
    relevant isolation_ucodes[] entry, which previously enumerated
    stepping 2.
    
    Although the original commit was characterized as an optimization, it
    is also a workaround for a correctness issue.
    
    If a PMI arrives between kvm's call to perf_guest_get_msrs() and the
    subsequent VM-entry, a stale value for the IA32_PEBS_ENABLE MSR may be
    restored at the next VM-exit. This is because, unbeknownst to kvm, PMI
    throttling may clear bits in the IA32_PEBS_ENABLE MSR. CPUs with "PEBS
    isolation" don't suffer from this issue, because perf_guest_get_msrs()
    doesn't report the IA32_PEBS_ENABLE value.

    perf/x86/intel/uncore: Remove uncore extra PCI dev HSWEP_PCI_PCU_3
    
    [ Upstream commit 9d480158ee86ad606d3a8baaf81e6b71acbfd7d5 ]
    
    There may be a kernel panic on the Haswell server and the Broadwell
    server, if the snbep_pci2phy_map_init() return error.
    
    The uncore_extra_pci_dev[HSWEP_PCI_PCU_3] is used in the cpu_init() to
    detect the existence of the SBOX, which is a MSR type of PMON unit.
    The uncore_extra_pci_dev is allocated in the uncore_pci_init(). If the
    snbep_pci2phy_map_init() returns error, perf doesn't initialize the
    PCI type of the PMON units, so the uncore_extra_pci_dev will not be
    allocated. But perf may continue initializing the MSR type of PMON
    units. A null dereference kernel panic will be triggered.
    
    The sockets in a Haswell server or a Broadwell server are identical.
    Only need to detect the existence of the SBOX once.
    Current perf probes all available PCU devices and stores them into the
    uncore_extra_pci_dev. It's unnecessary.
    Use the pci_get_device() to replace the uncore_extra_pci_dev. Only
    detect the existence of the SBOX on the first available PCU device once.
    
    Factor out hswep_has_limit_sbox(), since the Haswell server and the
    Broadwell server uses the same way to detect the existence of the SBOX.
    
    Add some macros to replace the magic number.

    locking/qrwlock: Fix ordering in queued_write_lock_slowpath()
    
    [ Upstream commit 84a24bf8c52e66b7ac89ada5e3cfbe72d65c1896 ]
    
    While this code is executed with the wait_lock held, a reader can
    acquire the lock without holding wait_lock.  The writer side loops
    checking the value with the atomic_cond_read_acquire(), but only truly
    acquires the lock when the compare-and-exchange is completed
    successfully which isn’t ordered. This exposes the window between the
    acquire and the cmpxchg to an A-B-A problem which allows reads
    following the lock acquisition to observe values speculatively before
    the write lock is truly acquired.
    
    We've seen a problem in epoll where the reader does a xchg while
    holding the read lock, but the writer can see a value change out from
    under it.

    A core can order the read of the ovflist ahead of the

    semantics addresses this issue at which point the atomic_cond_read can
    be switched to use relaxed semantics.

    bpf: Tighten speculative pointer arithmetic mask
    
    [ Upstream commit 7fedb63a8307dda0ec3b8969a3b233a1dd7ea8e0 ]
    
    This work tightens the offset mask we use for unprivileged pointer arithmetic
    in order to mitigate a corner case reported by Piotr and Benedict where in
    the speculative domain it is possible to advance, for example, the map value
    pointer by up to value_size-1 out-of-bounds in order to leak kernel memory
    via side-channel to user space.
    
    Before this change, the computed ptr_limit for retrieve_ptr_limit() helper
    represents largest valid distance when moving pointer to the right or left
    which is then fed as aux->alu_limit to generate masking instructions against
    the offset register. After the change, the derived aux->alu_limit represents
    the largest potential value of the offset register which we mask against which
    is just a narrower subset of the former limit.
    
    For minimal complexity, we call sanitize_ptr_alu() from 2 observation points
    in adjust_ptr_min_max_vals(), that is, before and after the simulated alu
    operation. In the first step, we retieve the alu_state and alu_limit before
    the operation as well as we branch-off a verifier path and push it to the
    verification stack as we did before which checks the dst_reg under truncation,
    in other words, when the speculative domain would attempt to move the pointer
    out-of-bounds.
    
    In the second step, we retrieve the new alu_limit and calculate the absolute
    distance between both. Moreover, we commit the alu_state and final alu_limit
    via update_alu_sanitation_state() to the env's instruction aux data, and bail
    out from there if there is a mismatch due to coming from different verification
    paths with different states.

    bpf: Refactor and streamline bounds check into helper
    
    [ Upstream commit 073815b756c51ba9d8384d924c5d1c03ca3d1ae4 ]
    
    Move the bounds check in adjust_ptr_min_max_vals() into a small helper named
    sanitize_check_bounds() in order to simplify the former a bit.

    bpf: Allow variable-offset stack access
    
    [ Upstream commit 01f810ace9ed37255f27608a0864abebccf0aab3 ]
    
    Before this patch, variable offset access to the stack was dissalowed
    for regular instructions, but was allowed for "indirect" accesses (i.e.
    helpers). This patch removes the restriction, allowing reading and
    writing to the stack through stack pointers with variable offsets. This
    makes stack-allocated buffers more usable in programs, and brings stack
    pointers closer to other types of pointers.
    
    The motivation is being able to use stack-allocated buffers for data
    manipulation. When the stack size limit is sufficient, allocating
    buffers on the stack is simpler than per-cpu arrays, or other
    alternatives.
    
    In unpriviledged programs, variable-offset reads and writes are
    disallowed (they were already disallowed for the indirect access case)
    because the speculative execution checking code doesn't support them.
    Additionally, when writing through a variable-offset stack pointer, if
    any pointers are in the accessible range, there's possilibities of later
    leaking pointers because the write cannot be tracked precisely.
    
    Writes with variable offset mark the whole range as initialized, even
    though we don't know which stack slots are actually written. This is in
    order to not reject future reads to these slots. Note that this doesn't
    affect writes done through helpers; like before, helpers need the whole
    stack range to be initialized to begin with.
    All the stack slots are in range are considered scalars after the write;
    variable-offset register spills are not tracked.
    
    For reads, all the stack slots in the variable range needs to be
    initialized (but see above about what writes do), otherwise the read is
    rejected. All register spilled in stack slots that might be read are
    marked as having been read, however reads through such pointers don't do
    register filling; the target register will always be either a scalar or
    a constant zero.

    bpf: Permits pointers on stack for helper calls
    
    [ Upstream commit cd17d38f8b28f808c368121041c0a4fa91757e0d ]
    
    Currently, when checking stack memory accessed by helper calls,
    for spills, only PTR_TO_BTF_ID and SCALAR_VALUE are
    allowed.
    
    Song discovered an issue where the below bpf program
      int dump_task(struct bpf_iter__task *ctx)
      {
        struct seq_file *seq = ctx->meta->seq;
        static char[] info = "abc";
        BPF_SEQ_PRINTF(seq, "%s\n", info);
        return 0;
      }
    may cause a verifier failure.
    
    The verifier output looks like:
      ; struct seq_file *seq = ctx->meta->seq;
      1: (79) r1 = *(u64 *)(r1 +0)
      ; BPF_SEQ_PRINTF(seq, "%s\n", info);
      2: (18) r2 = 0xffff9054400f6000
      4: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -8) = r2
      5: (bf) r4 = r10
      ;
      6: (07) r4 += -8
      ; BPF_SEQ_PRINTF(seq, "%s\n", info);
      7: (18) r2 = 0xffff9054400fe000
      9: (b4) w3 = 4
      10: (b4) w5 = 8
      11: (85) call bpf_seq_printf#126
       R1_w=ptr_seq_file(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2_w=map_value(id=0,off=0,ks=4,vs=4,imm=0)
      R3_w=inv4 R4_w=fp-8 R5_w=inv8 R10=fp0 fp-8_w=map_value
      last_idx 11 first_idx 0
      regs=8 stack=0 before 10: (b4) w5 = 8
      regs=8 stack=0 before 9: (b4) w3 = 4
      invalid indirect read from stack off -8+0 size 8
    
    Basically, the verifier complains the map_value pointer at "fp-8" location.
    To fix the issue, if env->allow_ptr_leaks is true, let us also permit
    pointers on the stack to be accessible by the helper.

    arm64: dts: allwinner: Revert SD card CD GPIO for Pine64-LTS
    
    [ Upstream commit 4d09ccc4a81e7de6b002482af554d8b5626f5041 ]
    
    Commit 941432d00768 ("arm64: dts: allwinner: Drop non-removable from
    SoPine/LTS SD card") enabled the card detect GPIO for the SOPine module,
    along the way with the Pine64-LTS, which share the same base .dtsi.
    
    This was based on the observation that the Pine64-LTS has as "push-push"
    SD card socket, and that the schematic mentions the card detect GPIO.
    
    After having received two reports about failing SD card access with that
    patch, some more research and polls on that subject revealed that there
    are at least two different versions of the Pine64-LTS out there:
    - On some boards (including mine) the card detect pin is "stuck" at
      high, regardless of an microSD card being inserted or not.
    - On other boards the card-detect is working, but is active-high, by
      virtue of an explicit inverter circuit, as shown in the schematic.
    
    To cover all versions of the board out there, and don't take any chances,
    let's revert the introduction of the active-low CD GPIO, but let's use
    the broken-cd property for the Pine64-LTS this time. That should avoid
    regressions and should work for everyone, even allowing SD card changes
    now.
    The SOPine card detect has proven to be working, so let's keep that
    GPIO in place.

    The original patch 8c657a0590de ("KEYS: trusted: Reserve TPM for seal

    But somehow got rebased so that the tpm_try_get_ops() in
    tpm2_seal_trusted() got lost.  This causes an imbalanced put of the
    TPM ops and causes oopses on TIS based hardware.
    
    This fix puts back the lost tpm_try_get_ops()

    As we are using cpu_pm to save and restore context, we must also save and
    restore the GPIO sysconfig register. This is needed because we are not
    calling PM runtime functions at all with cpu_pm.
    
    We need to save the sysconfig on idle as it's value can get reconfigured by
    PM runtime and can be different from the init time value. Device specific
    flags like "ti,no-idle-on-init" can affect the init value.
