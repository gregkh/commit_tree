    xfs: log vector rounding leaks log space
    
    commit 110dc24ad2ae4e9b94b08632fe1eb2fcdff83045 upstream.
    
    The addition of direct formatting of log items into the CIL
    linear buffer added alignment restrictions that the start of each
    vector needed to be 64 bit aligned. Hence padding was added in
    xlog_finish_iovec() to round up the vector length to ensure the next
    vector started with the correct alignment.
    
    This adds a small number of bytes to the size of
    the linear buffer that is otherwise unused. The issue is that we
    then use the linear buffer size to determine the log space used by
    the log item, and this includes the unused space. Hence when we
    account for space used by the log item, it's more than is actually
    written into the iclogs, and hence we slowly leak this space.
    
    This results on log hangs when reserving space, with threads getting
    stuck with these stack traces:
    
    Call Trace:
    [<ffffffff81d15989>] schedule+0x29/0x70
    [<ffffffff8150d3a2>] xlog_grant_head_wait+0xa2/0x1a0
    [<ffffffff8150d55d>] xlog_grant_head_check+0xbd/0x140
    [<ffffffff8150ee33>] xfs_log_reserve+0x103/0x220
    [<ffffffff814b7f05>] xfs_trans_reserve+0x2f5/0x310
    .....
    
    The 4 bytes is significant. Brain Foster did all the hard work in
    tracking down a reproducable leak to inode chunk allocation (it went
    away with the ikeep mount option). His rough numbers were that
    creating 50,000 inodes leaked 11 log blocks. This turns out to be
    roughly 800 inode chunks or 1600 inode cluster buffers. That
    works out at roughly 4 bytes per cluster buffer logged, and at that
    I started looking for a 4 byte leak in the buffer logging code.
    
    What I found was that a struct xfs_buf_log_format structure for an
    inode cluster buffer is 28 bytes in length. This gets rounded up to
    32 bytes, but the vector length remains 28 bytes. Hence the CIL
    ticket reservation is decremented by 32 bytes (via lv->lv_buf_len)
    for that vector rather than 28 bytes which are written into the log.
    
    The fix for this problem is to separately track the bytes used by
    the log vectors in the item and use that instead of the buffer
    length when accounting for the log space that will be used by the
    formatted log item.
    
    Again, thanks to Brian Foster for doing all the hard work and long
    hours to isolate this leak and make finding the bug relatively
    simple.

    This commit is a guesswork, but it seems to make sense to drop this
    break, as otherwise the following line is never executed and becomes
    dead code. And that following line actually saves the result of
    local calculation by the pointer given in function argument. So the
    proposed change makes sense if this code in the whole makes sense (but I
    am unable to analyze it in the whole).

    Fix detection of BREAK on sunsab serial console: BREAK detection was only
    performed when there were also serial characters received simultaneously.
    To handle all BREAKs correctly, the check for BREAK and the corresponding

    duplicate this code fragment and pull it out of the loop over the received
    characters.

    sparc64: Guard against flushing openfirmware mappings.
    
    [ Upstream commit 4ca9a23765da3260058db3431faf5b4efd8cf926 ]
    
    Based almost entirely upon a patch by Christopher Alexander Tobias
    Schulze.
    
    In commit db64fe02258f1507e13fe5212a989922323685ce ("mm: rewrite vmap
    layer") lazy VMAP tlb flushing was added to the vmalloc layer.  This
    causes problems on sparc64.
    
    Sparc64 has two VMAP mapped regions and they are not contiguous with
    eachother.  First we have the malloc mapping area, then another
    unrelated region, then the vmalloc region.
    
    This "another unrelated region" is where the firmware is mapped.
    
    If the lazy TLB flushing logic in the vmalloc code triggers after
    we've had both a module unload and a vfree or similar, it will pass an
    address range that goes from somewhere inside the malloc region to
    somewhere inside the vmalloc region, and thus covering the
    openfirmware area entirely.
    
    The sparc64 kernel learns about openfirmware's dynamic mappings in
    this region early in the boot, and then services TLB misses in this
    area.  But openfirmware has some locked TLB entries which are not
    mentioned in those dynamic mappings and we should thus not disturb
    them.
    
    These huge lazy TLB flush ranges causes those openfirmware locked TLB
    entries to be removed, resulting in all kinds of problems including
    hard hangs and crashes during reboot/reset.
    
    Besides causing problems like this, such huge TLB flush ranges are
    also incredibly inefficient.  A plea has been made with the author of
    the VMAP lazy TLB flushing code, but for now we'll put a safety guard
    into our flush_tlb_kernel_range() implementation.
    
    Since the implementation has become non-trivial, stop defining it as a
    macro and instead make it a function in a C source file.

    sparc64: Do not insert non-valid PTEs into the TSB hash table.
    
    [ Upstream commit 18f38132528c3e603c66ea464727b29e9bbcb91b ]
    
    The assumption was that update_mmu_cache() (and the equivalent for PMDs) would
    only be called when the PTE being installed will be accessible by the user.
    
    This is not true for code paths originating from remove_migration_pte().
    
    There are dire consequences for placing a non-valid PTE into the TSB.  The TLB
    miss frramework assumes thatwhen a TSB entry matches we can just load it into
    the TLB and return from the TLB miss trap.
    
    So if a non-valid PTE is in there, we will deadlock taking the TLB miss over
    and over, never satisfying the miss.
    
    Just exit early from update_mmu_cache() and friends in this situation.

    sparc64: Fix huge TSB mapping on pre-UltraSPARC-III cpus.
    
    [ Upstream commit b18eb2d779240631a098626cb6841ee2dd34fda0 ]
    
    Access to the TSB hash tables during TLB misses requires that there be
    an atomic 128-bit quad load available so that we fetch a matching TAG
    and DATA field at the same time.
    
    On cpus prior to UltraSPARC-III only virtual address based quad loads
    are available.  UltraSPARC-III and later provide physical address
    based variants which are easier to use.
    
    When we only have virtual address based quad loads available this
    means that we have to lock the TSB into the TLB at a fixed virtual
    address on each cpu when it runs that process.  We can't just access
    the PAGE_OFFSET based aliased mapping of these TSBs because we cannot
    take a recursive TLB miss inside of the TLB miss handler without
    risking running out of hardware trap levels (some trap combinations
    can be deep, such as those generated by register window spill and fill
    traps).
    
    Without huge pages it's working perfectly fine, but when the huge TSB
    got added another chunk of fixed virtual address space was not
    allocated for this second TSB mapping.
    
    So we were mapping both the 8K and 4MB TSBs to the same exact virtual
    address, causing multiple TLB matches which gives undefined behavior.

    sparc64: Don't bark so loudly about 32-bit tasks generating 64-bit fault addresses.
    
    [ Upstream commit e5c460f46ae7ee94831cb55cb980f942aa9e5a85 ]
    
    This was found using Dave Jone's trinity tool.
    
    When a user process which is 32-bit performs a load or a store, the
    cpu chops off the top 32-bits of the effective address before
    translating it.
    
    This is because we run 32-bit tasks with the PSTATE_AM (address
    masking) bit set.
    
    We can't run the kernel with that bit set, so when the kernel accesses
    userspace no address masking occurs.
    
    Since a 32-bit process will have no mappings in that region we will
    properly fault, so we don't try to handle this using access_ok(),
    which can safely just be a NOP on sparc64.
    
    Real faults from 32-bit processes should never generate such addresses
    so a bug check was added long ago, and it barks in the logs if this
    happens.
    
    But it also barks when a kernel user access causes this condition, and
    that _can_ happen.  For example, if a pointer passed into a system call
    is "0xfffffffc" and the kernel access 4 bytes offset from that pointer.
    
    Just handle such faults normally via the exception entries.

    with mprotect() and other situations.
    
    However we weren't handling this properly in the huge PMD paths.
    
    First of all, the page table walker in the TSB miss path only checks
    for _PAGE_PMD_HUGE.  So the generic pmdp_invalidate() would clear
    _PAGE_PRESENT but the TLB miss paths would still load it into the TLB
    as a valid huge PMD.
    
    Fix this by clearing the valid bit in pmdp_invalidate(), and also
    checking the valid bit in USER_PGTABLE_CHECK_PMD_HUGE using "brgez"
    since _PAGE_VALID is bit 63 in both the sun4u and sun4v pte layouts.

    batman-adv: Fix out-of-order fragmentation support
    
    [ Upstream commit d9124268d84a836f14a6ead54ff9d8eee4c43be5 ]
    
    batadv_frag_insert_packet was unable to handle out-of-order packets because it
    dropped them directly. This is caused by the way the fragmentation lists is
    checked for the correct place to insert a fragmentation entry.
    
    The fragmentation code keeps the fragments in lists. The fragmentation entries
    are kept in descending order of sequence number. The list is traversed and each
    entry is compared with the new fragment. If the current entry has a smaller
    sequence number than the new fragment then the new one has to be inserted
    before the current entry. This ensures that the list is still in descending
    order.
    
    An out-of-order packet with a smaller sequence number than all entries in the
    list still has to be added to the end of the list. The used hlist has no
    information about the last entry in the list inside hlist_head and thus the
    last entry has to be calculated differently. Currently the code assumes that
    the iterator variable of hlist_for_each_entry can be used for this purpose
    after the hlist_for_each_entry finished. This is obviously wrong because the
    iterator variable is always NULL when the list was completely traversed.
    
    Instead the information about the last entry has to be stored in a different
    variable.
    
    This problem was introduced in 610bfc6bc99bc83680d190ebc69359a05fc7f605
    ("batman-adv: Receive fragmented packets and merge").

    net: Correctly set segment mac_len in skb_segment().
    
    [ Upstream commit fcdfe3a7fa4cb74391d42b6a26dc07c20dab1d82 ]
    
    When performing segmentation, the mac_len value is copied right
    out of the original skb.  However, this value is not always set correctly
    (like when the packet is VLAN-tagged) and we'll end up copying a bad
    value.
    
    One way to demonstrate this is to configure a VM which tags
    packets internally and turn off VLAN acceleration on the forwarding
    bridge port.  The packets show up corrupt like this:
    16:18:24.985548 52:54:00:ab:be:25 > 52:54:00:26:ce:a3, ethertype 802.1Q
    (0x8100), length 1518: vlan 100, p 0, ethertype 0x05e0,
            0x0000:  8cdb 1c7c 8cdb 0064 4006 b59d 0a00 6402 ...|...d@.....d.

            0x0020:  29e3 01c9 f871 0000 0101 080a 000a e833)....q.........3
            0x0030:  000f 8c75 6e65 7470 6572 6600 6e65 7470 ...unetperf.netp
            0x0040:  6572 6600 6e65 7470 6572 6600 6e65 7470 erf.netperf.netp

            ...
    
    This also leads to awful throughput as GSO packets are dropped and
    cause retransmissions.
    
    The solution is to set the mac_len using the values already available
    in then new skb.  We've already adjusted all of the header offset, so we
    might as well correctly figure out the mac_len using skb_reset_mac_len().
    After this change, packets are segmented correctly and performance
    is restored.

    While we already had various kind of bugs in that area
    ec0223ec48a9 ("net: sctp: fix sctp_sf_do_5_1D_ce to verify if
    we/peer is AUTH capable") and b14878ccb7fa ("net: sctp: cache
    auth_enable per endpoint"), this one is a bit of a different
    kind.
    
    Giving a bit more background on why SCTP authentication is
    needed can be found in RFC4895:
    
      SCTP uses 32-bit verification tags to protect itself against
      blind attackers. These values are not changed during the
      lifetime of an SCTP association.
    
      Looking at new SCTP extensions, there is the need to have a
      method of proving that an SCTP chunk(s) was really sent by
      the original peer that started the association and not by a
      malicious attacker.
    
    To cause this bug, we're triggering an INIT collision between
    peers; normal SCTP handshake where both sides intent to
    authenticate packets contains RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO
    parameters that are being negotiated among peers:
    
      ---------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------->
      <------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------
      -------------------- COOKIE-ECHO -------------------->
      <-------------------- COOKIE-ACK ---------------------
    
    RFC4895 says that each endpoint therefore knows its own random
    number and the peer's random number *after* the association
    has been established. The local and peer's random number along
    with the shared key are then part of the secret used for
    calculating the HMAC in the AUTH chunk.
    
    Now, in our scenario, we have 2 threads with 1 non-blocking
    SEQ_PACKET socket each, setting up common shared SCTP_AUTH_KEY
    and SCTP_AUTH_ACTIVE_KEY properly, and each of them calling
    sctp_bindx(3), listen(2) and connect(2) against each other,
    thus the handshake looks similar to this, e.g.:
    
      ---------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------->
      <------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------
      <--------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] -----------
      -------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] -------->
      ...
    
    Since such collisions can also happen with verification tags,
    the RFC4895 for AUTH rather vaguely says under section 6.1:
    
      In case of INIT collision, the rules governing the handling
      of this Random Number follow the same pattern as those for
      the Verification Tag, as explained in Section 5.2.4 of
      RFC 2960 [5]. Therefore, each endpoint knows its own Random
      Number and the peer's Random Number after the association
      has been established.
    
    In RFC2960, section 5.2.4, we're eventually hitting Action B:
    
      B) In this case, both sides may be attempting to start an
         association at about the same time but the peer endpoint
         started its INIT after responding to the local endpoint's
         INIT. Thus it may have picked a new Verification Tag not
         being aware of the previous Tag it had sent this endpoint.
         The endpoint should stay in or enter the ESTABLISHED
         state but it MUST update its peer's Verification Tag from
         the State Cookie, stop any init or cookie timers that may
         running and send a COOKIE ACK.
    
    In other words, the handling of the Random parameter is the
    same as behavior for the Verification Tag as described in
    Action B of section 5.2.4.
    
    Looking at the code, we exactly hit the sctp_sf_do_dupcook_b()
    case which triggers an SCTP_CMD_UPDATE_ASSOC command to the
    side effect interpreter, and in fact it properly copies over
    peer_{random, hmacs, chunks} parameters from the newly created
    association to update the existing one.
    
    Also, the old asoc_shared_key is being released and based on
    the new params, sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() updated.
    However, the issue observed in this case is that the previous
    asoc->peer.auth_capable was 0, and has *not* been updated, so
    that instead of creating a new secret, we're doing an early
    return from the function sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key()
    leaving asoc->asoc_shared_key as NULL. However, we now have to
    authenticate chunks from the updated chunk list (e.g. COOKIE-ACK).
    
    That in fact causes the server side when responding with ...
    
      <------------------ AUTH; COOKIE-ACK -----------------
    
    ... to trigger a NULL pointer dereference, since in
    sctp_packet_transmit(), it discovers that an AUTH chunk is
    being queued for xmit, and thus it calls sctp_auth_calculate_hmac().
    
    Since the asoc->active_key_id is still inherited from the
    endpoint, and the same as encoded into the chunk, it uses
    asoc->asoc_shared_key, which is still NULL, as an asoc_key
    and dereferences it in ...
    
      crypto_hash_setkey(desc.tfm, &asoc_key->data[0], asoc_key->len)
    
    ... causing an oops. All this happens because sctp_make_cookie_ack()
    called with the *new* association has the peer.auth_capable=1
    and therefore marks the chunk with auth=1 after checking
    sctp_auth_send_cid(), but it is *actually* sent later on over
    the then *updated* association's transport that didn't initialize
    its shared key due to peer.auth_capable=0. Since control chunks
    in that case are not sent by the temporary association which
    are scheduled for deletion, they are issued for xmit via
    SCTP_CMD_REPLY in the interpreter with the context of the
    *updated* association. peer.auth_capable was 0 in the updated
    association (which went from COOKIE_WAIT into ESTABLISHED state),
    since all previous processing that performed sctp_process_init()
    was being done on temporary associations, that we eventually
    throw away each time.
    
    The correct fix is to update to the new peer.auth_capable
    value as well in the collision case via sctp_assoc_update(),
    so that in case the collision migrated from 0 -> 1,
    sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() can properly recalculate
    the secret. This therefore fixes the observed server panic.

    ip_tunnel(ipv4): fix tunnels with "local any remote $remote_ip"
    
    [ Upstream commit 95cb5745983c222867cc9ac593aebb2ad67d72c0 ]
    
    Ipv4 tunnels created with "local any remote $ip" didn't work properly since
    7d442fab0 (ipv4: Cache dst in tunnels). 99% of packets sent via those tunnels
    had src addr = 0.0.0.0. That was because only dst_entry was cached, although
    fl4.saddr has to be cached too. Every time ip_tunnel_xmit used cached dst_entry
    (tunnel_rtable_get returned non-NULL), fl4.saddr was initialized with
    tnl_params->saddr (= 0 in our case), and wasn't changed until iptunnel_xmit().
    
    This patch adds saddr to ip_tunnel->dst_cache, fixing this issue.

    net: phy: re-apply PHY fixups during phy_register_device
    
    [ Upstream commit d92f5dec6325079c550889883af51db1b77d5623 ]
    
    Commit 87aa9f9c61ad ("net: phy: consolidate PHY reset in phy_init_hw()")
    moved the call to phy_scan_fixups() in phy_init_hw() after a software
    reset is performed.
    
    By the time phy_init_hw() is called in phy_device_register(), no driver
    has been bound to this PHY yet, so all the checks in phy_init_hw()
    against the PHY driver and the PHY driver's config_init function will
    return 0. We will therefore never call phy_scan_fixups() as we should.
    
    Fix this by calling phy_scan_fixups() and check for its return value to
    restore the intended functionality.
    
    This broke PHY drivers which do register an early PHY fixup callback to
    intercept the PHY probing and do things like changing the 32-bits unique
    PHY identifier when a pseudo-PHY address has been used, as well as
    board-specific PHY fixups that need to be applied during driver probe
    time.

    This reports means that we've come to netlink_sendmsg() with msg->msg_name == NULL and msg->msg_namelen > 0.
    
    After this report there was no usual "Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference"
    and this gave me a clue that address 0 is mapped and contains valid socket address structure in it.
    
    This bug was introduced in f3d3342602f8bcbf37d7c46641cb9bca7618eb1c
    (net: rework recvmsg handler msg_name and msg_namelen logic).
    Commit message states that:
            "Set msg->msg_name = NULL if user specified a NULL in msg_name but had a
             non-null msg_namelen in verify_iovec/verify_compat_iovec. This doesn't
             affect sendto as it would bail out earlier while trying to copy-in the
             address."
    But in fact this affects sendto when address 0 is mapped and contains
    socket address structure in it. In such case copy-in address will succeed,
    verify_iovec() function will successfully exit with msg->msg_namelen > 0
    and msg->msg_name == NULL.
    
    This patch fixes it by setting msg_namelen to 0 if msg_name == NULL.

    ip: make IP identifiers less predictable
    
    [ Upstream commit 04ca6973f7c1a0d8537f2d9906a0cf8e69886d75 ]
    
    In "Counting Packets Sent Between Arbitrary Internet Hosts", Jeffrey and
    Jedidiah describe ways exploiting linux IP identifier generation to
    infer whether two machines are exchanging packets.
    
    With commit 73f156a6e8c1 ("inetpeer: get rid of ip_id_count"), we
    changed IP id generation, but this does not really prevent this
    side-channel technique.
    
    This patch adds a random amount of perturbation so that IP identifiers
    for a given destination [1] are no longer monotonically increasing after
    an idle period.
    
    Note that prandom_u32_max(1) returns 0, so if generator is used at most
    once per jiffy, this patch inserts no hole in the ID suite and do not
    increase collision probability.
    
    This is jiffies based, so in the worst case (HZ=1000), the id can
    rollover after ~65 seconds of idle time, which should be fine.
    
    We also change the hash used in __ip_select_ident() to not only hash
    on daddr, but also saddr and protocol, so that ICMP probes can not be
    used to infer information for other protocols.
    
    For IPv6, adds saddr into the hash as well, but not nexthdr.
    
    If I ping the patched target, we can see ID are now hard to predict.
    
    21:57:11.008086 IP (...)
        A > target: ICMP echo request, seq 1, length 64

    inetpeer: get rid of ip_id_count
    
    [ Upstream commit 73f156a6e8c1074ac6327e0abd1169e95eb66463 ]
    
    Ideally, we would need to generate IP ID using a per destination IP
    generator.
    
    linux kernels used inet_peer cache for this purpose, but this had a huge
    cost on servers disabling MTU discovery.
    
    1) each inet_peer struct consumes 192 bytes
    
    2) inetpeer cache uses a binary tree of inet_peer structs,
       with a nominal size of ~66000 elements under load.
    
    3) lookups in this tree are hitting a lot of cache lines, as tree depth
       is about 20.
    
    4) If server deals with many tcp flows, we have a high probability of
       not finding the inet_peer, allocating a fresh one, inserting it in
       the tree with same initial ip_id_count, (cf secure_ip_id())
    
    5) We garbage collect inet_peer aggressively.
    
    IP ID generation do not have to be 'perfect'
    
    Goal is trying to avoid duplicates in a short period of time,
    so that reassembly units have a chance to complete reassembly of
    fragments belonging to one message before receiving other fragments
    with a recycled ID.
    
    We simply use an array of generators, and a Jenkin hash using the dst IP
    as a key.
    
    ipv6_select_ident() is put back into net/ipv6/ip6_output.c where it
    belongs (it is only used from this file)
    
    secure_ip_id() and secure_ipv6_id() no longer are needed.
    
    Rename ip_select_ident_more() to ip_select_ident_segs() to avoid
    unnecessary decrement/increment of the number of segments.

    xfrm: Fix installation of AH IPsec SAs
    
    [ Upstream commit a0e5ef53aac8e5049f9344857d8ec5237d31e58b ]
    
    The SPI check introduced in ea9884b3acf3311c8a11db67bfab21773f6f82ba
    was intended for IPComp SAs but actually prevented AH SAs from getting
    installed (depending on the SPI).
    
    Fixes: ea9884b3acf3 ("xfrm: check user specified spi for IPComp")
