    kvm: vmx: allow host to access guest MSR_IA32_BNDCFGS
    
    commit 691bd4340bef49cf7e5855d06cf24444b5bf2d85 upstream.
    
    It's easier for host applications, such as QEMU, if they can always
    access guest MSR_IA32_BNDCFGS in VMCS, even though MPX is disabled in
    guest cpuid.

    kvm: vmx: Do not disable intercepts for BNDCFGS
    
    commit a8b6fda38f80e75afa3b125c9e7f2550b579454b upstream.
    
    The MSR permission bitmaps are shared by all VMs. However, some VMs
    may not be configured to support MPX, even when the host does. If the
    host supports VMX and the guest does not, we should intercept accesses
    to the BNDCFGS MSR, so that we can synthesize a #GP
    fault. Furthermore, if the host does not support MPX and the
    "ignore_msrs" kvm kernel parameter is set, then we should intercept
    accesses to the BNDCFGS MSR, so that we can skip over the rdmsr/wrmsr
    without raising a #GP fault.

    PM / wakeirq: Convert to SRCU
    
    commit ea0212f40c6bc0594c8eff79266759e3ecd4bacc upstream.
    
    The wakeirq infrastructure uses RCU to protect the list of wakeirqs. That
    breaks the irq bus locking infrastructure, which is allows sleeping
    functions to be called so interrupt controllers behind slow busses,
    e.g. i2c, can be handled.
    
    The wakeirq functions hold rcu_read_lock and call into irq functions, which
    in case of interrupts using the irq bus locking will trigger a
    might_sleep() splat.
    
    Convert the wakeirq infrastructure to Sleepable RCU and unbreak it.

    sched/topology: Fix overlapping sched_group_mask
    
    commit 73bb059f9b8a00c5e1bf2f7ca83138c05d05e600 upstream.
    
    The point of sched_group_mask is to select those CPUs from
    sched_group_cpus that can actually arrive at this balance domain.
    
    The current code gets it wrong, as can be readily demonstrated with a
    topology like:
    
      node   0   1   2   3
        0:  10  20  30  20
        1:  20  10  20  30
        2:  30  20  10  20
        3:  20  30  20  10
    
    Where (for example) domain 1 on CPU1 ends up with a mask that includes
    CPU0:
    
      [] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
      []  domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
      []   groups: 1 (mask: 1), 2, 0
      []   domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
      []    groups: 0-2 (mask: 0-2) (cpu_capacity: 3072), 0,2-3 (cpu_capacity: 3072)
    
    This causes sched_balance_cpu() to compute the wrong CPU and
    consequently should_we_balance() will terminate early resulting in
    missed load-balance opportunities.
    
    The fixed topology looks like:
    
      [] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
      []  domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
      []   groups: 1 (mask: 1), 2, 0
      []   domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
      []    groups: 0-2 (mask: 1) (cpu_capacity: 3072), 0,2-3 (cpu_capacity: 3072)
    
    (note: this relies on OVERLAP domains to always have children, this is
     true because the regular topology domains are still here -- this is
     before degenerate trimming)

    sched/topology: Fix building of overlapping sched-groups
    
    commit 0372dd2736e02672ac6e189c31f7d8c02ad543cd upstream.
    
    When building the overlapping groups, we very obviously should start
    with the previous domain of _this_ @cpu, not CPU-0.
    
    This can be readily demonstrated with a topology like:
    
      node   0   1   2   3
        0:  10  20  30  20
        1:  20  10  20  30
        2:  30  20  10  20
        3:  20  30  20  10
    
    Where (for example) CPU1 ends up generating the following nonsensical groups:
    
      [] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
      []  domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
      []   groups: 1 2 0
      []   domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
      []    groups: 1-3 (cpu_capacity = 3072) 0-1,3 (cpu_capacity = 3072)
    
    Where the fact that domain 1 doesn't include a group with span 0-2 is
    the obvious fail.
    
    With patch this looks like:
    
      [] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
      []  domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
      []   groups: 1 0 2
      []   domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
      []    groups: 0-2 (cpu_capacity = 3072) 0,2-3 (cpu_capacity = 3072)

    crypto: caam - fix signals handling
    
    commit 7459e1d25ffefa2b1be799477fcc1f6c62f6cec7 upstream.
    
    Driver does not properly handle the case when signals interrupt
    wait_for_completion_interruptible():
    -it does not check for return value
    -completion structure is allocated on stack; in case a signal interrupts
    the sleep, it will go out of scope, causing the worker thread
    (caam_jr_dequeue) to fail when it accesses it
    
    wait_for_completion_interruptible() is replaced with uninterruptable
    wait_for_completion().
    We choose to block all signals while waiting for I/O (device executing
    the split key generation job descriptor) since the alternative - in
    order to have a deterministic device state - would be to flush the job
    ring (aborting *all* in-progress jobs).

    crypto: caam - properly set IV after {en,de}crypt
    
    commit 854b06f768794cd664886ec3ba3a5b1c58d42167 upstream.
    
    Certain cipher modes like CTS expect the IV (req->info) of
    ablkcipher_request (or equivalently req->iv of skcipher_request) to
    contain the last ciphertext block when the {en,de}crypt operation is done.
    This is currently not the case for the CAAM driver which in turn breaks
    e.g. cts(cbc(aes)) when the CAAM driver is enabled.
    
    This patch fixes the CAAM driver to properly set the IV after the
    {en,de}crypt operation of ablkcipher finishes.
    
    This issue was revealed by the changes in the SW CTS mode in commit
    0605c41cc53ca ("crypto: cts - Convert to skcipher")

    mm: fix overflow check in expand_upwards()
    
    commit 37511fb5c91db93d8bd6e3f52f86e5a7ff7cfcdf upstream.
    
    JÃ¶rn Engel noticed that the expand_upwards() function might not return
    -ENOMEM in case the requested address is (unsigned long)-PAGE_SIZE and
    if the architecture didn't defined TASK_SIZE as multiple of PAGE_SIZE.
    
    Affected architectures are arm, frv, m68k, blackfin, h8300 and xtensa
    which all define TASK_SIZE as 0xffffffff, but since none of those have
    an upwards-growing stack we currently have no actual issue.
    
    Nevertheless let's fix this just in case any of the architectures with
    an upward-growing stack (currently parisc, metag and partly ia64) define
    TASK_SIZE similar.

    selftests/capabilities: Fix the test_execve test
    
    commit 796a3bae2fba6810427efdb314a1c126c9490fb3 upstream.
    
    test_execve does rather odd mount manipulations to safely create
    temporary setuid and setgid executables that aren't visible to the
    rest of the system.  Those executables end up in the test's cwd, but
    that cwd is MNT_DETACHed.
    
    The core namespace code considers MNT_DETACHed trees to belong to no
    mount namespace at all and, in general, MNT_DETACHed trees are only
    barely function.  This interacted with commit 380cf5ba6b0a ("fs:
    Treat foreign mounts as nosuid") to cause all MNT_DETACHed trees to
    act as though they're nosuid, breaking the test.
    
    Fix it by just not detaching the tree.  It's still in a private
    mount namespace and is therefore still invisible to the rest of the
    system (except via /proc, and the same nosuid logic will protect all
    other programs on the system from believing in test_execve's setuid
    bits).
    
    While we're at it, fix some blatant whitespace problems.

    mnt: Make propagate_umount less slow for overlapping mount propagation trees
    
    commit 296990deb389c7da21c78030376ba244dc1badf5 upstream.
    
    Andrei Vagin pointed out that time to executue propagate_umount can go
    non-linear (and take a ludicrious amount of time) when the mount
    propogation trees of the mounts to be unmunted by a lazy unmount
    overlap.
    
    Make the walk of the mount propagation trees nearly linear by
    remembering which mounts have already been visited, allowing
    subsequent walks to detect when walking a mount propgation tree or a
    subtree of a mount propgation tree would be duplicate work and to skip
    them entirely.
    
    Walk the list of mounts whose propgatation trees need to be traversed
    from the mount highest in the mount tree to mounts lower in the mount
    tree so that odds are higher that the code will walk the largest trees
    first, allowing later tree walks to be skipped entirely.
    
    Add cleanup_umount_visitation to remover the code's memory of which
    mounts have been visited.
    
    Add the functions last_slave and skip_propagation_subtree to allow
    skipping appropriate parts of the mount propagation tree without
    needing to change the logic of the rest of the code.
    
    A script to generate overlapping mount propagation trees:
    
    $ cat runs.h
    set -e
    mount -t tmpfs zdtm /mnt
    mkdir -p /mnt/1 /mnt/2
    mount -t tmpfs zdtm /mnt/1
    mount --make-shared /mnt/1
    mkdir /mnt/1/1
    
    iteration=10
    if [ -n "$1" ] ; then
            iteration=$1
    fi
    
    for i in $(seq $iteration); do
            mount --bind /mnt/1/1 /mnt/1/1
    done
    
    mount --rbind /mnt/1 /mnt/2
    
    TIMEFORMAT='%Rs'
    nr=$(( ( 2 ** ( $iteration + 1 ) ) + 1 ))
    echo -n "umount -l /mnt/1 -> $nr        "
    time umount -l /mnt/1
    
    nr=$(cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep zdtm | wc -l )
    time umount -l /mnt/2
    
    $ for i in $(seq 9 19); do echo $i; unshare -Urm bash ./run.sh $i; done

    mnt: In propgate_umount handle visiting mounts in any order
    
    commit 99b19d16471e9c3faa85cad38abc9cbbe04c6d55 upstream.
    
    While investigating some poor umount performance I realized that in
    the case of overlapping mount trees where some of the mounts are locked
    the code has been failing to unmount all of the mounts it should
    have been unmounting.
    
    This failure to unmount all of the necessary
    mounts can be reproduced with:
    
    $ cat locked_mounts_test.sh
    
    mount -t tmpfs test-base /mnt
    mount --make-shared /mnt
    mkdir -p /mnt/b
    
    mount -t tmpfs test1 /mnt/b
    mount --make-shared /mnt/b
    mkdir -p /mnt/b/10
    
    mount -t tmpfs test2 /mnt/b/10
    mount --make-shared /mnt/b/10
    mkdir -p /mnt/b/10/20
    
    mount --rbind /mnt/b /mnt/b/10/20
    
    unshare -Urm --propagation unchaged /bin/sh -c 'sleep 5; if [ $(grep test /proc/self/mountinfo | wc -l) -eq 1 ] ; then echo SUCCESS ; else echo FAILURE ; fi'
    sleep 1
    umount -l /mnt/b
    wait %%
    
    $ unshare -Urm ./locked_mounts_test.sh
    
    This failure is corrected by removing the prepass that marks mounts
    that may be umounted.
    
    A first pass is added that umounts mounts if possible and if not sets
    mount mark if they could be unmounted if they weren't locked and adds
    them to a list to umount possibilities.  This first pass reconsiders
    the mounts parent if it is on the list of umount possibilities, ensuring
    that information of umoutability will pass from child to mount parent.
    
    A second pass then walks through all mounts that are umounted and processes
    their children unmounting them or marking them for reparenting.
    
    A last pass cleans up the state on the mounts that could not be umounted
    and if applicable reparents them to their first parent that remained
    mounted.
    
    While a bit longer than the old code this code is much more robust
    as it allows information to flow up from the leaves and down
    from the trunk making the order in which mounts are encountered
    in the umount propgation tree irrelevant.

    mnt: In umount propagation reparent in a separate pass
    
    commit 570487d3faf2a1d8a220e6ee10f472163123d7da upstream.
    
    It was observed that in some pathlogical cases that the current code
    does not unmount everything it should.  After investigation it
    was determined that the issue is that mnt_change_mntpoint can
    can change which mounts are available to be unmounted during mount
    propagation which is wrong.
    
    The trivial reproducer is:
    $ cat ./pathological.sh
    
    mount -t tmpfs test-base /mnt
    cd /mnt
    mkdir 1 2 1/1
    mount --bind 1 1
    mount --make-shared 1
    mount --bind 1 2
    mount --bind 1/1 1/1
    mount --bind 1/1 1/1
    echo
    grep test-base /proc/self/mountinfo
    umount 1/1
    echo
    grep test-base /proc/self/mountinfo
    
    $ unshare -Urm ./pathological.sh
    
    The expected output looks like:
    46 31 0:25 / /mnt rw,relatime - tmpfs test-base rw,uid=1000,gid=1000
    47 46 0:25 /1 /mnt/1 rw,relatime shared:1 - tmpfs test-base rw,uid=1000,gid=1000
    48 46 0:25 /1 /mnt/2 rw,relatime shared:1 - tmpfs test-base rw,uid=1000,gid=1000

    48 46 0:25 /1 /mnt/2 rw,relatime shared:1 - tmpfs test-base rw,uid=1000,gid=1000
    
    The output without the fix looks like:
    46 31 0:25 / /mnt rw,relatime - tmpfs test-base rw,uid=1000,gid=1000
    47 46 0:25 /1 /mnt/1 rw,relatime shared:1 - tmpfs test-base rw,uid=1000,gid=1000

    That last mount in the output was in the propgation tree to be unmounted but
    was missed because the mnt_change_mountpoint changed it's parent before the walk
    through the mount propagation tree observed it.

    arm64: Preventing READ_IMPLIES_EXEC propagation
    
    commit 48f99c8ec0b25756d0283ab058826ae07d14fad7 upstream.
    
    Like arch/arm/, we inherit the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality flag across
    fork(). This is undesirable for a number of reasons:
    
      * ELF files that don't require executable stack can end up with it
        anyway
    
      * We end up performing un-necessary I-cache maintenance when mapping
        what should be non-executable pages
    
      * Restricting what is executable is generally desirable when defending
        against overflow attacks
    
    This patch clears the personality flag when setting up the personality for
    newly spwaned native tasks. Given that semi-recent AArch64 toolchains emit
    a non-executable PT_GNU_STACK header, userspace applications can already
    not rely on READ_IMPLIES_EXEC so shouldn't be adversely affected by this
    change.

    powerpc/kexec: Fix radix to hash kexec due to IAMR/AMOR
    
    commit 1e2a516e89fc412a754327522ab271b42f99c6b4 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a crash seen while doing a kexec from radix mode to
    hash mode. Key 0 is special in hash and used in the RPN by default, we
    set the key values to 0 today. In radix mode key 0 is used to control
    supervisor<->user access. In hash key 0 is used by default, so the
    first instruction after the switch causes a crash on kexec.
    
    Commit 3b10d0095a1e ("powerpc/mm/radix: Prevent kernel execution of
    user space") introduced the setting of IAMR and AMOR values to prevent
    execution of user mode instructions from supervisor mode. We need to
    clean up these SPR's on kexec.

    exec: Limit arg stack to at most 75% of _STK_LIM
    
    commit da029c11e6b12f321f36dac8771e833b65cec962 upstream.
    
    To avoid pathological stack usage or the need to special-case setuid
    execs, just limit all arg stack usage to at most 75% of _STK_LIM (6MB).

    s390: reduce ELF_ET_DYN_BASE
    
    commit a73dc5370e153ac63718d850bddf0c9aa9d871e6 upstream.
    
    Now that explicitly executed loaders are loaded in the mmap region, we
    have more freedom to decide where we position PIE binaries in the
    address space to avoid possible collisions with mmap or stack regions.
    
    For 64-bit, align to 4GB to allow runtimes to use the entire 32-bit
    address space for 32-bit pointers.  On 32-bit use 4MB, which is the
    traditional x86 minimum load location, likely to avoid historically
    requiring a 4MB page table entry when only a portion of the first 4MB
    would be used (since the NULL address is avoided).  For s390 the
    position could be 0x10000, but that is needlessly close to the NULL
    address.

    arm64: move ELF_ET_DYN_BASE to 4GB / 4MB

    binfmt_elf: use ELF_ET_DYN_BASE only for PIE
    
    commit eab09532d40090698b05a07c1c87f39fdbc5fab5 upstream.
    
    The ELF_ET_DYN_BASE position was originally intended to keep loaders
    away from ET_EXEC binaries.  (For example, running "/lib/ld-linux.so.2
    /bin/cat" might cause the subsequent load of /bin/cat into where the
    loader had been loaded.)
    
    With the advent of PIE (ET_DYN binaries with an INTERP Program Header),
    ELF_ET_DYN_BASE continued to be used since the kernel was only looking
    at ET_DYN.  However, since ELF_ET_DYN_BASE is traditionally set at the
    top 1/3rd of the TASK_SIZE, a substantial portion of the address space
    is unused.
    
    For 32-bit tasks when RLIMIT_STACK is set to RLIM_INFINITY, programs are
    loaded above the mmap region.  This means they can be made to collide
    (CVE-2017-1000370) or nearly collide (CVE-2017-1000371) with
    pathological stack regions.
    
    Lowering ELF_ET_DYN_BASE solves both by moving programs below the mmap
    region in all cases, and will now additionally avoid programs falling
    back to the mmap region by enforcing MAP_FIXED for program loads (i.e.
    if it would have collided with the stack, now it will fail to load
    instead of falling back to the mmap region).
    
    To allow for a lower ELF_ET_DYN_BASE, loaders (ET_DYN without INTERP)
    are loaded into the mmap region, leaving space available for either an
    ET_EXEC binary with a fixed location or PIE being loaded into mmap by
    the loader.  Only PIE programs are loaded offset from ELF_ET_DYN_BASE,
    which means architectures can now safely lower their values without risk
    of loaders colliding with their subsequently loaded programs.
    
    For 64-bit, ELF_ET_DYN_BASE is best set to 4GB to allow runtimes to use
    the entire 32-bit address space for 32-bit pointers.
    
    Thanks to PaX Team, Daniel Micay, and Rik van Riel for inspiration and
    suggestions on how to implement this solution.

    As of perl 5, version 26, subversion 0 (v5.26.0) some new warnings have
    occurred when running checkpatch.
    
    Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated here (and will be fatal in
    Perl 5.30), passed through in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/^(.\s*){
    <-- HERE \s*/ at scripts/checkpatch.pl line 3544.
    
    Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated here (and will be fatal in

    Perl 5.30), passed through in regex; marked by <-- HERE in
    m/^(\+.*(?:do|\))){ <-- HERE / at scripts/checkpatch.pl line 4374.
    
    It seems perfectly reasonable to do as the warning suggests and simply
    escape the left brace in these three locations.

    fs/dcache.c: fix spin lockup issue on nlru->lock
    
    commit b17c070fb624cf10162cf92ea5e1ec25cd8ac176 upstream.
    
    __list_lru_walk_one() acquires nlru spin lock (nlru->lock) for longer
    duration if there are more number of items in the lru list.  As per the
    current code, it can hold the spin lock for upto maximum UINT_MAX
    entries at a time.  So if there are more number of items in the lru
    list, then "BUG: spinlock lockup suspected" is observed in the below
    path:
    
      spin_bug+0x90
      do_raw_spin_lock+0xfc
      _raw_spin_lock+0x28

      user_path_at_empty+0x54
      SyS_faccessat+0xd0
      el0_svc_naked+0x24
    
    This nlru->lock is acquired by another CPU in this path -
    
      d_lru_shrink_move+0x34
      dentry_lru_isolate_shrink+0x48
      __list_lru_walk_one.isra.10+0x94

      worker_thread+0x2e0
      kthread+0xf4
      ret_from_fork+0x10
    
    Fix this lockup by reducing the number of entries to be shrinked from
    the lru list to 1024 at once.  Also, add cond_resched() before
    processing the lru list again.

    mm/list_lru.c: fix list_lru_count_node() to be race free
    
    commit 2c80cd57c74339889a8752b20862a16c28929c3a upstream.
    
    list_lru_count_node() iterates over all memcgs to get the total number of
    entries on the node but it can race with memcg_drain_all_list_lrus(),
    which migrates the entries from a dead cgroup to another.  This can return
    incorrect number of entries from list_lru_count_node().
    
    Fix this by keeping track of entries per node and simply return it in
    list_lru_count_node().

    commit c0d80ddab89916273cb97114889d3f337bc370ae upstream.

    tools/lib/lockdep: Reduce MAX_LOCK_DEPTH to avoid overflowing lock_chain/: Depth
    
    commit 98dcea0cfd04e083ac74137ceb9a632604740e2d upstream.
    
    liblockdep has been broken since commit 75dd602a5198 ("lockdep: Fix
    lock_chain::base size"), as that adds a check that MAX_LOCK_DEPTH is
    within the range of lock_chain::depth and in liblockdep it is much
    too large.
    
    That should have resulted in a compiler error, but didn't because:
    
    - the check uses ARRAY_SIZE(), which isn't yet defined in liblockdep
      so is assumed to be an (undeclared) function
    - putting a function call inside a BUILD_BUG_ON() expression quietly
      turns it into some nonsense involving a variable-length array
    
    It did produce a compiler warning, but I didn't notice because
    liblockdep already produces too many warnings if -Wall is enabled
    (which I'll fix shortly).
    
    Even before that commit, which reduced lock_chain::depth from 8 bits
    to 6, MAX_LOCK_DEPTH was too large.

    parisc/mm: Ensure IRQs are off in switch_mm()
    
    commit 649aa24254e85bf6bd7807dd372d083707852b1f upstream.
    
    This is because of commit f98db6013c55 ("sched/core: Add switch_mm_irqs_off()
    and use it in the scheduler") in which switch_mm_irqs_off() is called by the
    scheduler, vs switch_mm() which is used by use_mm().
    
    This patch lets the parisc code mirror the x86 and powerpc code, ie. it
    disables interrupts in switch_mm(), and optimises the scheduler case by
    defining switch_mm_irqs_off().

    parisc: Report SIGSEGV instead of SIGBUS when running out of stack
    
    commit 247462316f85a9e0479445c1a4223950b68ffac1 upstream.
    
    When a process runs out of stack the parisc kernel wrongly faults with SIGBUS
    instead of the expected SIGSEGV signal.
    
    This example shows how the kernel faults:
    do_page_fault() command='a.out' type=15 address=0xfaac2000 in libc-2.24.so[f8308000+16c000]
    trap #15: Data TLB miss fault, vm_start = 0xfa2c2000, vm_end = 0xfaac2000
    
    The vma->vm_end value is the first address which does not belong to the vma, so
    adjust the check to include vma->vm_end to the range for which to send the
    SIGSEGV signal.
    
    This patch unbreaks building the debian libsigsegv package.

    commit 0a27844ce86d039d74221dd56cd8c0349b146b63 upstream.
    
    nla policy checks for only maximum length of the attribute data when the
    attribute type is NLA_BINARY. If userspace sends less data than
    specified, cfg80211 may access illegal memory. When type is NLA_UNSPEC,
    nla policy check ensures that userspace sends minimum specified length
    number of bytes.
    
    Remove type assignment to NLA_BINARY from nla_policy of
    NL80211_NAN_FUNC_SERVICE_ID to make these NLA_UNSPEC and to make sure
    minimum NL80211_NAN_FUNC_SERVICE_ID_LEN bytes are received from
    userspace with NL80211_NAN_FUNC_SERVICE_ID.

    cfg80211: Check if PMKID attribute is of expected size
    
    commit 9361df14d1cbf966409d5d6f48bb334384fbe138 upstream.
    
    nla policy checks for only maximum length of the attribute data
    when the attribute type is NLA_BINARY. If userspace sends less
    data than specified, the wireless drivers may access illegal
    memory. When type is NLA_UNSPEC, nla policy check ensures that
    userspace sends minimum specified length number of bytes.
    
    Remove type assignment to NLA_BINARY from nla_policy of
    NL80211_ATTR_PMKID to make this NLA_UNSPEC and to make sure minimum
    WLAN_PMKID_LEN bytes are received from userspace with
    NL80211_ATTR_PMKID.

    cfg80211: Validate frequencies nested in NL80211_ATTR_SCAN_FREQUENCIES
    
    commit d7f13f7450369281a5d0ea463cc69890a15923ae upstream.
    
    validate_scan_freqs() retrieves frequencies from attributes
    nested in the attribute NL80211_ATTR_SCAN_FREQUENCIES with
    nla_get_u32(), which reads 4 bytes from each attribute
    without validating the size of data received. Attributes
    nested in NL80211_ATTR_SCAN_FREQUENCIES don't have an nla policy.
    
    Validate size of each attribute before parsing to avoid potential buffer
    overread.

    commit 8feb69c7bd89513be80eb19198d48f154b254021 upstream.
    
    Buffer overread may happen as nl80211_set_station() reads 4 bytes
    from the attribute NL80211_ATTR_LOCAL_MESH_POWER_MODE without
    validating the size of data received when userspace sends less

    brcmfmac: Fix glom_skb leak in brcmf_sdiod_recv_chain
    
    commit 5ea59db8a375216e6c915c5586f556766673b5a7 upstream.
    
    An earlier change to this function (3bdae810721b) fixed a leak in the
    case of an unsuccessful call to brcmf_sdiod_buffrw(). However, the
    glom_skb buffer, used for emulating a scattering read, is never used
    or referenced after its contents are copied into the destination
    buffers, and therefore always needs to be freed by the end of the
    function.

    The function assumes that each PMD points to head of a

    start of any 8M region with a, say 256M, hugepage. The

    If we have more than 32 unicast MAC addresses assigned to an interface
    we will read beyond the end of the address table in the driver when
    adding filters. The next 256 entries store multicast addresses, so we
    will end up attempting to insert duplicate filters, which is mostly
    harmless. If we add more than 288 unicast addresses we will then read
    past the multicast address table, which is likely to be more exciting.

    The lower level nl80211 code in cfg80211 ensures that "len" is between
    25 and NL80211_ATTR_FRAME (2304).  We subtract DOT11_MGMT_HDR_LEN (24) from
    "len" so thats's max of 2280.  However, the action_frame->data[] buffer is
    only BRCMF_FIL_ACTION_FRAME_SIZE (1800) bytes long so this memcpy() can
    overflow.

    cxgb4: fix BUG() on interrupt deallocating path of ULD
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6a146f3a5894b751cef16feb3d7903e45e3c445c ]
    
    Since the introduction of ULD (Upper-Layer Drivers), the MSI-X
    deallocating path changed in cxgb4: the driver frees the interrupts
    of ULD when unregistering it or on shutdown PCI handler.
    
    Problem is that if a MSI-X is not freed before deallocated in the PCI
    layer, it will trigger a BUG() due to still "alive" interrupt being
    tentatively quiesced.
    
    The below trace was observed when doing a simple unbind of Chelsio's
    adapter PCI function, like:
      "echo 001e:80:00.4 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/cxgb4/unbind"

    net/mlx5e: Initialize CEE's getpermhwaddr address buffer to 0xff
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d968f0f2e4404152f37ed2384b4a2269dd2dae5a ]
    
    Latest change in open-lldp code uses bytes 6-11 of perm_addr buffer
    as the Ethernet source address for the host TLV packet.
    Since our driver does not fill these bytes, they stay at zero and
    the open-lldp code ends up sending the TLV packet with zero source
    address and the switch drops this packet.
    
    The fix is to initialize these bytes to 0xff. The open-lldp code
    considers 0xff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff as the invalid address and falls back to
    use the host's mac address as the Ethernet source address.

    rds: tcp: use sock_create_lite() to create the accept socket
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 0933a578cd55b02dc80f219dc8f2efb17ec61c9a ]
    
    There are two problems with calling sock_create_kern() from
    rds_tcp_accept_one()
    1. it sets up a new_sock->sk that is wasteful, because this ->sk
       is going to get replaced by inet_accept() in the subsequent ->accept()
    2. The new_sock->sk is a leaked reference in sock_graft() which
       expects to find a null parent->sk
    
    Avoid these problems by calling sock_create_lite().

    vrf: fix bug_on triggered by rx when destroying a vrf
    
    
    [ Upstream commit f630c38ef0d785101363a8992bbd4f302180f86f ]
    
    When destroying a VRF device we cleanup the slaves in its ndo_uninit()
    function, but that causes packets to be switched (skb->dev == vrf being
    destroyed) even though we're pass the point where the VRF should be
    receiving any packets while it is being dismantled. This causes a BUG_ON
    to trigger if we have raw sockets (trace below).
    The reason is that the inetdev of the VRF has been destroyed but we're
    still sending packets up the stack with it, so let's free the slaves in
    the dellink callback as David Ahern suggested.
    
    Note that this fix doesn't prevent packets from going up when the VRF
    device is admin down.

    The code that detects a failed soft reset of Octeon is comparing the wrong
    value against the reset value of the Octeon SLI_SCRATCH_1 register,
    resulting in an inability to detect a soft reset failure.  Fix it by using
    the correct value in the comparison, which is any non-zero value.

    ipv6: dad: don't remove dynamic addresses if link is down
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ec8add2a4c9df723c94a863b8fcd6d93c472deed ]
    
    Currently, when the link for $DEV is down, this command succeeds but the
    address is removed immediately by DAD (1):
    
        ip addr add 1111::12/64 dev $DEV valid_lft 3600 preferred_lft 1800
    
    In the same situation, this will succeed and not remove the address (2):
    
        ip addr add 1111::12/64 dev $DEV
        ip addr change 1111::12/64 dev $DEV valid_lft 3600 preferred_lft 1800
    
    The comment in addrconf_dad_begin() when !IF_READY makes it look like
    this is the intended behavior, but doesn't explain why:
    
         * If the device is not ready:
         * - keep it tentative if it is a permanent address.
         * - otherwise, kill it.
    
    We clearly cannot prevent userspace from doing (2), but we can make (1)
    work consistently with (2).
    
    addrconf_dad_stop() is only called in two cases: if DAD failed, or to
    skip DAD when the link is down. In that second case, the fix is to avoid
    deleting the address, like we already do for permanent addresses.

    net: handle NAPI_GRO_FREE_STOLEN_HEAD case also in napi_frags_finish()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit e44699d2c28067f69698ccb68dd3ddeacfebc434 ]
    
    Recently I started seeing warnings about pages with refcount -1. The
    problem was traced to packets being reused after their head was merged into
    a GRO packet by skb_gro_receive(). While bisecting the issue pointed to
    commit c21b48cc1bbf ("net: adjust skb->truesize in ___pskb_trim()") and
    I have never seen it on a kernel with it reverted, I believe the real
    problem appeared earlier when the option to merge head frag in GRO was
    implemented.
    
    Handling NAPI_GRO_FREE_STOLEN_HEAD state was only added to GRO_MERGED_FREE
    branch of napi_skb_finish() so that if the driver uses napi_gro_frags()
    and head is merged (which in my case happens after the skb_condense()
    call added by the commit mentioned above), the skb is reused including the
    head that has been merged. As a result, we release the page reference
    twice and eventually end up with negative page refcount.
    
    To fix the problem, handle NAPI_GRO_FREE_STOLEN_HEAD in napi_frags_finish()
    the same way it's done in napi_skb_finish().

    bpf: prevent leaking pointer via xadd on unpriviledged
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6bdf6abc56b53103324dfd270a86580306e1a232 ]
    
    Leaking kernel addresses on unpriviledged is generally disallowed,
    for example, verifier rejects the following:
    
      0: (b7) r0 = 0
      1: (18) r2 = 0xffff897e82304400
      3: (7b) *(u64 *)(r1 +48) = r2
      R2 leaks addr into ctx
    
    Doing pointer arithmetic on them is also forbidden, so that they
    don't turn into unknown value and then get leaked out. However,
    there's xadd as a special case, where we don't check the src reg
    for being a pointer register, e.g. the following will pass:
    
      0: (b7) r0 = 0
      1: (7b) *(u64 *)(r1 +48) = r0
      2: (18) r2 = 0xffff897e82304400 ; map
      4: (db) lock *(u64 *)(r1 +48) += r2
      5: (95) exit
    
    We could store the pointer into skb->cb, loose the type context,
    and then read it out from there again to leak it eventually out
    of a map value. Or more easily in a different variant, too:
    
       0: (bf) r6 = r1
       1: (7a) *(u64 *)(r10 -8) = 0
       2: (bf) r2 = r10
       3: (07) r2 += -8
       4: (18) r1 = 0x0
       6: (85) call bpf_map_lookup_elem#1
       7: (15) if r0 == 0x0 goto pc+3
       R0=map_value(ks=8,vs=8,id=0),min_value=0,max_value=0 R6=ctx R10=fp
       8: (b7) r3 = 0
       9: (7b) *(u64 *)(r0 +0) = r3
      10: (db) lock *(u64 *)(r0 +0) += r6
      11: (b7) r0 = 0
      12: (95) exit
    
      from 7 to 11: R0=inv,min_value=0,max_value=0 R6=ctx R10=fp
      11: (b7) r0 = 0
      12: (95) exit
    
    Prevent this by checking xadd src reg for pointer types. Also
    add a couple of test cases related to this.

    mlxsw: spectrum_router: Fix NULL pointer dereference
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6b27c8adf27edf1dabe2cdcfaa101ef7e2712415 ]
    
    In case a VLAN device is enslaved to a bridge we shouldn't create a
    router interface (RIF) for it when it's configured with an IP address.
    This is already handled by the driver for other types of netdevs, such
    as physical ports and LAG devices.
    
    If this IP address is then removed and the interface is subsequently
    unlinked from the bridge, a NULL pointer dereference can happen, as the
    original 802.1d FID was replaced with an rFID which was then deleted.
    
    To reproduce:
    $ ip link set dev enp3s0np9 up
    $ ip link add name enp3s0np9.111 link enp3s0np9 type vlan id 111
    $ ip link set dev enp3s0np9.111 up
    $ ip link add name br0 type bridge
    $ ip link set dev br0 up
    $ ip link set enp3s0np9.111 master br0
    $ ip address add dev enp3s0np9.111 192.168.0.1/24
    $ ip address del dev enp3s0np9.111 192.168.0.1/24

    net: sched: Fix one possible panic when no destroy callback
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c1a4872ebfb83b1af7144f7b29ac8c4b344a12a8 ]
    
    When qdisc fail to init, qdisc_create would invoke the destroy callback
    to cleanup. But there is no check if the callback exists really. So it
    would cause the panic if there is no real destroy callback like the qdisc
    codel, fq, and so on.
    
    Take codel as an example following:
    When a malicious user constructs one invalid netlink msg, it would cause
    codel_init->codel_change->nla_parse_nested failed.
    Then kernel would invoke the destroy callback directly but qdisc codel
    doesn't define one. It causes one panic as a result.
    
    Now add one the check for destroy to avoid the possible panic.

    net: dp83640: Avoid NULL pointer dereference.
    
    
    [ Upstream commit db9d8b29d19d2801793e4419f4c6272bf8951c62 ]
    
    The function, skb_complete_tx_timestamp(), used to allow passing in a
    NULL pointer for the time stamps, but that was changed in commit
    62bccb8cdb69051b95a55ab0c489e3cab261c8ef ("net-timestamp: Make the
    clone operation stand-alone from phy timestamping"), and the existing
    call sites, all of which are in the dp83640 driver, were fixed up.
    
    Even though the kernel-doc was subsequently updated in commit
    7a76a021cd5a292be875fbc616daf03eab1e6996 ("net-timestamp: Update
    skb_complete_tx_timestamp comment"), still a bug fix from Manfred
    Rudigier came into the driver using the old semantics.  Probably
    Manfred derived that patch from an older kernel version.
    
    This fix should be applied to the stable trees as well.

    net: account for current skb length when deciding about UFO
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a5cb659bbc1c8644efa0c3138a757a1e432a4880 ]
    
    Our customer encountered stuck NFS writes for blocks starting at specific
    offsets w.r.t. page boundary caused by networking stack sending packets via
    UFO enabled device with wrong checksum. The problem can be reproduced by
    composing a long UDP datagram from multiple parts using MSG_MORE flag:
    
      sendto(sd, buff, 1000, MSG_MORE, ...);
      sendto(sd, buff, 1000, MSG_MORE, ...);
      sendto(sd, buff, 3000, 0, ...);
    
    Assume this packet is to be routed via a device with MTU 1500 and
    NETIF_F_UFO enabled. When second sendto() gets into __ip_append_data(),
    this condition is tested (among others) to decide whether to call
    ip_ufo_append_data():
    
      ((length + fragheaderlen) > mtu) || (skb && skb_is_gso(skb))
    
    At the moment, we already have skb with 1028 bytes of data which is not
    marked for GSO so that the test is false (fragheaderlen is usually 20).
    Thus we append second 1000 bytes to this skb without invoking UFO. Third
    sendto(), however, has sufficient length to trigger the UFO path so that we
    end up with non-UFO skb followed by a UFO one. Later on, udp_send_skb()
    uses udp_csum() to calculate the checksum but that assumes all fragments
    have correct checksum in skb->csum which is not true for UFO fragments.
    
    When checking against MTU, we need to add skb->len to length of new segment
    if we already have a partially filled skb and fragheaderlen only if there
    isn't one.
    
    In the IPv6 case, skb can only be null if this is the first segment so that
    we have to use headersize (length of the first IPv6 header) rather than
    fragheaderlen (length of IPv6 header of further fragments) for skb == NULL.

    sfc: Fix MCDI command size for filter operations
    
    
    [ Upstream commit bb53f4d4f5116d3dae76bb12fb16bc73771f958a ]
    
    The 8000 series adapters uses catch-all filters for encapsulated traffic
    to support filtering VXLAN, NVGRE and GENEVE traffic.
    This new filter functionality requires a longer MCDI command.
    This patch increases the size of buffers on stack that were missed, which
    fixes a kernel panic from the stack protector.

    As the value is only set once to the argument of alloc_netdev_mq(),
    we can compare against that constant directly.

    ipv6: avoid unregistering inet6_dev for loopback
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 60abc0be96e00ca71bac083215ac91ad2e575096 ]
    
    The per netns loopback_dev->ip6_ptr is unregistered and set to
    NULL when its mtu is set to smaller than IPV6_MIN_MTU, this
    leads to that we could set rt->rt6i_idev NULL after a
    rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev() and then crash after another
    call.
    
    In this case we should just bring its inet6_dev down, rather
    than unregistering it, at least prior to commit 176c39af29bc
    ("netns: fix addrconf_ifdown kernel panic") we always
    override the case for loopback.
    
    Thanks a lot to Andrey for finding a reliable reproducer.

    net/phy: micrel: configure intterupts after autoneg workaround
    
    
    [ Upstream commit b866203d872d5deeafcecd25ea429d6748b5bd56 ]
    
    The commit ("net/phy: micrel: Add workaround for bad autoneg") fixes an
    autoneg failure case by resetting the hardware. This turns off
    intterupts. Things will work themselves out if the phy polls, as it will
    figure out it's state during a poll. However if the phy uses only
    intterupts, the phy will stall, since interrupts are off. This patch
    fixes the issue by calling config_intr after resetting the phy.
