    udp: properly support MSG_PEEK with truncated buffers
    
    [ Upstream commit 197c949e7798fbf28cfadc69d9ca0c2abbf93191 ]
    
    Backport of this upstream commit into stable kernels :
    89c22d8c3b27 ("net: Fix skb csum races when peeking")
    exposed a bug in udp stack vs MSG_PEEK support, when user provides
    a buffer smaller than skb payload.
    
    In this case,
    skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_iovec(skb, sizeof(struct udphdr),
                                     msg->msg_iov);
    returns -EFAULT.
    
    This bug does not happen in upstream kernels since Al Viro did a great
    job to replace this into :
    skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_msg(skb, sizeof(struct udphdr), msg);
    This variant is safe vs short buffers.
    
    For the time being, instead reverting Herbert Xu patch and add back
    skb->ip_summed invalid changes, simply store the result of
    udp_lib_checksum_complete() so that we avoid computing the checksum a
    second time, and avoid the problematic
    skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_iovec() call.
    
    This patch can be applied on recent kernels as it avoids a double
    checksumming, then backported to stable kernels as a bug fix.

    nfsd: encoders mustn't use unitialized values in error cases
    
    [ Upstream commit f961e3f2acae94b727380c0b74e2d3954d0edf79 ]
    
    In error cases, lgp->lg_layout_type may be out of bounds; so we
    shouldn't be using it until after the check of nfserr.
    
    This was seen to crash nfsd threads when the server receives a LAYOUTGET
    request with a large layout type.
    
    GETDEVICEINFO has the same problem.

    arm64: uaccess: ensure extension of access_ok() addr
    
    [ Upstream commit a06040d7a791a9177581dcf7293941bd92400856 ]
    
    Our access_ok() simply hands its arguments over to __range_ok(), which
    implicitly assummes that the addr parameter is 64 bits wide. This isn't
    necessarily true for compat code, which might pass down a 32-bit address
    parameter.
    
    In these cases, we don't have a guarantee that the address has been zero
    extended to 64 bits, and the upper bits of the register may contain
    unknown values, potentially resulting in a suprious failure.
    
    Avoid this by explicitly casting the addr parameter to an unsigned long
    (as is done on other architectures), ensuring that the parameter is
    widened appropriately.

    arm64: documentation: document tagged pointer stack constraints
    
    [ Upstream commit f0e421b1bf7af97f026e1bb8bfe4c5a7a8c08f42 ]
    
    Some kernel features don't currently work if a task puts a non-zero
    address tag in its stack pointer, frame pointer, or frame record entries
    (FP, LR).
    
    For example, with a tagged stack pointer, the kernel can't deliver
    signals to the process, and the task is killed instead. As another
    example, with a tagged frame pointer or frame records, perf fails to
    generate call graphs or resolve symbols.
    
    For now, just document these limitations, instead of finding and fixing
    everything that doesn't work, as it's not known if anyone needs to use
    tags in these places anyway.
    
    In addition, as requested by Dave Martin, generalize the limitations
    into a general kernel address tag policy, and refactor
    tagged-pointers.txt to include it.

    iscsi-target: Set session_fall_back_to_erl0 when forcing reinstatement
    
    [ Upstream commit 197b806ae5db60c6f609d74da04ddb62ea5e1b00 ]
    
    While testing modification of per se_node_acl queue_depth forcing
    session reinstatement via lio_target_nacl_cmdsn_depth_store() ->
    core_tpg_set_initiator_node_queue_depth(), a hung task bug triggered
    when changing cmdsn_depth invoked session reinstatement while an iscsi
    login was already waiting for session reinstatement to complete.
    
    This can happen when an outstanding se_cmd descriptor is taking a
    long time to complete, and session reinstatement from iscsi login
    or cmdsn_depth change occurs concurrently.
    
    To address this bug, explicitly set session_fall_back_to_erl0 = 1
    when forcing session reinstatement, so session reinstatement is
    not attempted if an active session is already being shutdown.
    
    This patch has been tested with two scenarios.  The first when
    iscsi login is blocked waiting for iscsi session reinstatement
    to complete followed by queue_depth change via configfs, and
    second when queue_depth change via configfs us blocked followed
    by a iscsi login driven session reinstatement.
    
    Note this patch depends on commit d36ad77f702 to handle multiple
    sessions per se_node_acl when changing cmdsn_depth, and for
    pre v4.5 kernels will need to be included for stable as well.

    target: Fix compare_and_write_callback handling for non GOOD status
    
    [ Upstream commit a71a5dc7f833943998e97ca8fa6a4c708a0ed1a9 ]
    
    Following the bugfix for handling non SAM_STAT_GOOD COMPARE_AND_WRITE
    status during COMMIT phase in commit 9b2792c3da1, the same bug exists
    for the READ phase as well.
    
    This would manifest first as a lost SCSI response, and eventual
    hung task during fabric driver logout or re-login, as existing
    shutdown logic waited for the COMPARE_AND_WRITE se_cmd->cmd_kref
    to reach zero.
    
    To address this bug, compare_and_write_callback() has been changed
    to set post_ret = 1 and return TCM_LOGICAL_UNIT_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
    as necessary to signal failure status.

    The metag implementation of strncpy_from_user() doesn't validate the src
    pointer, which could allow reading of arbitrary kernel memory. Add a
    short access_ok() check to prevent that.
    
    Its still possible for it to read across the user/kernel boundary, but
    it will invariably reach a NUL character after only 9 bytes, leaking
    only a static kernel address being loaded into D0Re0 at the beginning of
    __start, which is acceptable for the immediate fix.

    noticed by Al Viro where it doesn't behave correctly:
    
     - The kernel range check has off by 1 errors which permit access to the
       first and last byte of the kernel mapped range.
    
     - The kernel range check ends at LINCORE_BASE rather than
       META_MEMORY_LIMIT, which is ineffective when the kernel is in global
       space (an extremely uncommon configuration).
    
    There are a couple of other shortcomings here too:
    
     - Access to the whole of the other address space is permitted (i.e. the
       global half of the address space when the kernel is in local space).
       This isn't ideal as it could theoretically still contain privileged
       mappings set up by the bootloader.
    
     - The size argument is unused, permitting user copies which start on
       valid pages at the end of the user address range and cross the
       boundary into the kernel address space (e.g. addr = 0x3ffffff0, size
       > 0x10).
    
    It isn't very convenient to add size checks when disallowing certain
    regions, and it seems far safer to be sure and explicit about what
    userland is able to access, so invert the logic to allow certain regions
    instead, and fix the off by 1 errors and missing size checks. This also
    allows the get_fs() == KERNEL_DS check to be more easily optimised into
    the user address range case.
    
    We now have 3 such allowed regions:
    
     - The user address range (incorporating the get_fs() == KERNEL_DS
       check).
    
     - NULL (some kernel code expects this to work, and we'll always catch
       the fault anyway).
    
     - The core code memory region.

    Data-Out buffer. For VERIFY, honor the VRPROTECT, DPO and FUA
    fields. This patch avoids that LIO complains about a mismatch
    between the expected transfer length and the SCSI CDB length

    dm bufio: check new buffer allocation watermark every 30 seconds
    
    [ Upstream commit 390020ad2af9ca04844c4f3b1f299ad8746d84c8 ]
    
    dm-bufio checks a watermark when it allocates a new buffer in
    __bufio_new().  However, it doesn't check the watermark when the user
    changes /sys/module/dm_bufio/parameters/max_cache_size_bytes.
    
    This may result in a problem - if the watermark is high enough so that
    all possible buffers are allocated and if the user lowers the value of
    "max_cache_size_bytes", the watermark will never be checked against the
    new value because no new buffer would be allocated.
    
    To fix this, change __evict_old_buffers() so that it checks the
    watermark.  __evict_old_buffers() is called every 30 seconds, so if the
    user reduces "max_cache_size_bytes", dm-bufio will react to this change
    within 30 seconds and decrease memory consumption.

    dm bufio: avoid a possible ABBA deadlock
    
    [ Upstream commit 1b0fb5a5b2dc0dddcfa575060441a7176ba7ac37 ]
    
    __get_memory_limit() tests if dm_bufio_cache_size changed and calls
    __cache_size_refresh() if it did.  It takes dm_bufio_clients_lock while
    it already holds the client lock.  However, lock ordering is violated
    because in cleanup_old_buffers() dm_bufio_clients_lock is taken before
    the client lock.
    
    This results in a possible deadlock and lockdep engine warning.
    
    Fix this deadlock by changing mutex_lock() to mutex_trylock().  If the
    lock can't be taken, it will be re-checked next time when a new buffer
    is allocated.
    
    Also add "unlikely" to the if condition, so that the optimizer assumes
    that the condition is false.

    ext4: evict inline data when writing to memory map
    
    [ Upstream commit 7b4cc9787fe35b3ee2dfb1c35e22eafc32e00c33 ]
    
    Currently the case of writing via mmap to a file with inline data is not
    handled.  This is maybe a rare case since it requires a writable memory
    map of a very small file, but it is trivial to trigger with on
    inline_data filesystem, and it causes the

    ext4_writepages() to be hit:

    We could try to be smart and keep the inline data in this case, or at
    least support delayed allocation when allocating the block, but these
    solutions would be more complicated and don't seem worthwhile given how
    rare this case seems to be.  So just fix the bug by calling
    ext4_convert_inline_data() when we're asked to make a page writable, so
    that any inline data gets evicted, with the block allocated immediately.

    dm ioctl: prevent stack leak in dm ioctl call
    
    [ Upstream commit 4617f564c06117c7d1b611be49521a4430042287 ]
    
    When calling a dm ioctl that doesn't process any data
    (IOCTL_FLAGS_NO_PARAMS), the contents of the data field in struct
    dm_ioctl are left initialized.  Current code is incorrectly extending
    the size of data copied back to user, causing the contents of kernel
    stack to be leaked to user.  Fix by only copying contents before data
    and allow the functions processing the ioctl to override.

    The NFSv2/v3 code does not systematically check whether we decode past
    the end of the buffer.  This generally appears to be harmless, but there
    are a few places where we do arithmetic on the pointers involved and
    don't account for the possibility that a length could be negative.  Add

    nfsd: check for oversized NFSv2/v3 arguments
    
    [ Upstream commit e6838a29ecb484c97e4efef9429643b9851fba6e ]
    
    A client can append random data to the end of an NFSv2 or NFSv3 RPC call
    without our complaining; we'll just stop parsing at the end of the
    expected data and ignore the rest.
    
    Encoded arguments and replies are stored together in an array of pages,
    and if a call is too large it could leave inadequate space for the
    reply.  This is normally OK because NFS RPC's typically have either
    short arguments and long replies (like READ) or long arguments and short
    replies (like WRITE).  But a client that sends an incorrectly long reply
    can violate those assumptions.  This was observed to cause crashes.
    
    Also, several operations increment rq_next_page in the decode routine
    before checking the argument size, which can leave rq_next_page pointing
    well past the end of the page array, causing trouble later in
    svc_free_pages.
    
    So, following a suggestion from Neil Brown, add a central check to
    enforce our expectation that no NFSv2/v3 call has both a large call and
    a large reply.
    
    As followup we may also want to rewrite the encoding routines to check
    more carefully that they aren't running off the end of the page array.
    
    We may also consider rejecting calls that have any extra garbage
    appended.  That would be safer, and within our rights by spec, but given
    the age of our server and the NFS protocol, and the fact that we've
    never enforced this before, we may need to balance that against the
    possibility of breaking some oddball client.

    ASoC: intel: Fix PM and non-atomic crash in bytcr drivers
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e4cac23c5a648d50b107d1b53e9c4e1120c7943 ]
    
    The FE setups of Intel SST bytcr_rt5640 and bytcr_rt5651 drivers carry
    the ignore_suspend flag, and this prevents the suspend/resume working
    properly while the stream is running, since SST core code has the
    check of the running streams and returns -EBUSY.  Drop these
    superfluous flags for fixing the behavior.
    
    Also, the bytcr_rt5640 driver lacks of nonatomic flag in some FE
    definitions, which leads to the kernel Oops at suspend/resume like:

    dm era: save spacemap metadata root after the pre-commit
    
    [ Upstream commit 117aceb030307dcd431fdcff87ce988d3016c34a ]
    
    When committing era metadata to disk, it doesn't always save the latest
    spacemap metadata root in superblock. Due to this, metadata is getting
    corrupted sometimes when reopening the device. The correct order of update
    should be, pre-commit (shadows spacemap root), save the spacemap root
    (newly shadowed block) to in-core superblock and then the final commit.

    dm btree: fix for dm_btree_find_lowest_key()
    
    [ Upstream commit 7d1fedb6e96a960aa91e4ff70714c3fb09195a5a ]
    
    dm_btree_find_lowest_key() is giving incorrect results.  find_key()
    traverses the btree correctly for finding the highest key, but there is
    an error in the way it traverses the btree for retrieving the lowest
    key.  dm_btree_find_lowest_key() fetches the first key of the rightmost
    block of the btree instead of fetching the first key from the leftmost
    block.
    
    Fix this by conditionally passing the correct parameter to value64()
    based on the @find_highest flag.

    powerpc/pseries: Fix of_node_put() underflow during DLPAR remove
    
    [ Upstream commit 68baf692c435339e6295cb470ea5545cbc28160e ]
    
    Historically struct device_node references were tracked using a kref embedded as
    a struct field. Commit 75b57ecf9d1d ("of: Make device nodes kobjects so they
    show up in sysfs") (Mar 2014) refactored device_nodes to be kobjects such that
    the device tree could by more simply exposed to userspace using sysfs.
    
    Commit 0829f6d1f69e ("of: device_node kobject lifecycle fixes") (Mar 2014)
    followed up these changes to better control the kobject lifecycle and in
    particular the referecne counting via of_node_get(), of_node_put(), and
    of_node_init().
    
    A result of this second commit was that it introduced an of_node_put() call when
    a dynamic node is detached, in of_node_remove(), that removes the initial kobj
    reference created by of_node_init().
    
    Traditionally as the original dynamic device node user the pseries code had
    assumed responsibilty for releasing this final reference in its platform
    specific DLPAR detach code.
    
    This patch fixes a refcount underflow introduced by commit 0829f6d1f6, and
    recently exposed by the upstreaming of the recount API.
    
    Messages like the following are no longer seen in the kernel log with this
    patch following DLPAR remove operations of cpus and pci devices.

    x86/boot: Fix BSS corruption/overwrite bug in early x86 kernel startup
    
    [ Upstream commit d594aa0277e541bb997aef0bc0a55172d8138340 ]
    
    The minimum size for a new stack (512 bytes) setup for arch/x86/boot components
    when the bootloader does not setup/provide a stack for the early boot components
    is not "enough".
    
    The setup code executing as part of early kernel startup code, uses the stack
    beyond 512 bytes and accidentally overwrites and corrupts part of the BSS
    section. This is exposed mostly in the early video setup code, where
    it was corrupting BSS variables like force_x, force_y, which in-turn affected
    kernel parameters such as screen_info (screen_info.orig_video_cols) and
    later caused an exception/panic in console_init().
    
    Most recent boot loaders setup the stack for early boot components, so this
    stack overwriting into BSS section issue has not been exposed.

    ring-buffer: Have ring_buffer_iter_empty() return true when empty
    
    [ Upstream commit 78f7a45dac2a2d2002f98a3a95f7979867868d73 ]
    
    I noticed that reading the snapshot file when it is empty no longer gives a
    status. It suppose to show the status of the snapshot buffer as well as how
    to allocate and use it. For example:
    
     ># cat snapshot
     # tracer: nop
     #
     #
     # * Snapshot is allocated *
     #
     # Snapshot commands:
     # echo 0 > snapshot : Clears and frees snapshot buffer
     # echo 1 > snapshot : Allocates snapshot buffer, if not already allocated.
     #                      Takes a snapshot of the main buffer.
     # echo 2 > snapshot : Clears snapshot buffer (but does not allocate or free)
     #                      (Doesn't have to be '2' works with any number that
     #                       is not a '0' or '1')
    
    But instead it just showed an empty buffer:
    
     ># cat snapshot
     # tracer: nop
     #
     # entries-in-buffer/entries-written: 0/0   #P:4
     #
     #                              _-----=> irqs-off
     #                             / _----=> need-resched
     #                            | / _---=> hardirq/softirq
     #                            || / _--=> preempt-depth
     #                            ||| /     delay
     #           TASK-PID   CPU#  ||||    TIMESTAMP  FUNCTION
     #              | |       |   ||||       |         |
    
    What happened was that it was using the ring_buffer_iter_empty() function to
    see if it was empty, and if it was, it showed the status. But that function
    was returning false when it was empty. The reason was that the iter header
    page was on the reader page, and the reader page was empty, but so was the
    buffer itself. The check only tested to see if the iter was on the commit
    page, but the commit page was no longer pointing to the reader page, but as
    all pages were empty, the buffer is also.

    ACPI / power: Avoid maybe-uninitialized warning
    
    [ Upstream commit fe8c470ab87d90e4b5115902dd94eced7e3305c3 ]
    
    gcc -O2 cannot always prove that the loop in acpi_power_get_inferred_state()
    is enterered at least once, so it assumes that cur_state might not get
    initialized:
    
    drivers/acpi/power.c: In function 'acpi_power_get_inferred_state':
    drivers/acpi/power.c:222:9: error: 'cur_state' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    
    This sets the variable to zero at the start of the loop, to ensure that
    there is well-defined behavior even for an empty list. This gets rid of
    the warning.
    
    The warning first showed up when the -Os flag got removed in a bug fix
    patch in linux-4.11-rc5.
    
    I would suggest merging this addon patch on top of that bug fix to avoid
    introducing a new warning in the stable kernels.

    tracing: Allocate the snapshot buffer before enabling probe
    
    [ Upstream commit df62db5be2e5f070ecd1a5ece5945b590ee112e0 ]
    
    Currently the snapshot trigger enables the probe and then allocates the
    snapshot. If the probe triggers before the allocation, it could cause the
    snapshot to fail and turn tracing off. It's best to allocate the snapshot
    buffer first, and then enable the trigger. If something goes wrong in the
    enabling of the trigger, the snapshot buffer is still allocated, but it can
    also be freed by the user by writting zero into the snapshot buffer file.
    
    Also add a check of the return status of alloc_snapshot().

    PCI: Freeze PME scan before suspending devices
    
    [ Upstream commit ea00353f36b64375518662a8ad15e39218a1f324 ]
    
    Laurent Pinchart reported that the Renesas R-Car H2 Lager board (r8a7790)
    crashes during suspend tests.  Geert Uytterhoeven managed to reproduce the
    issue on an M2-W Koelsch board (r8a7791):
    
      It occurs when the PME scan runs, once per second.  During PME scan, the
      PCI host bridge (rcar-pci) registers are accessed while its module clock
      has already been disabled, leading to the crash.
    
    One reproducer is to configure s2ram to use "s2idle" instead of "deep"
    suspend:
    
      # echo 0 > /sys/module/printk/parameters/console_suspend
      # echo s2idle > /sys/power/mem_sleep
      # echo mem > /sys/power/state
    
    Another reproducer is to write either "platform" or "processors" to
    /sys/power/pm_test.  It does not (or is less likely) to happen during full
    system suspend ("core" or "none") because system suspend also disables
    timers, and thus the workqueue handling PME scans no longer runs.  Geert
    believes the issue may still happen in the small window between disabling
    module clocks and disabling timers:
    
      # echo 0 > /sys/module/printk/parameters/console_suspend
      # echo platform > /sys/power/pm_test    # Or "processors"
      # echo mem > /sys/power/state
    
    (Make sure CONFIG_PCI_RCAR_GEN2 and CONFIG_USB_OHCI_HCD_PCI are enabled.)
    
    Rafael Wysocki agrees that PME scans should be suspended before the host
    bridge registers become inaccessible.  To that end, queue the task on a
    workqueue that gets frozen before devices suspend.
    
    Rafael notes however that as a result, some wakeup events may be missed if
    they are delivered via PME from a device without working IRQ (which hence
    must be polled) and occur after the workqueue has been frozen.  If that
    turns out to be an issue in practice, it may be possible to solve it by
    calling pci_pme_list_scan() once directly from one of the host bridge's
    pm_ops callbacks.

    regmap_read/write(), regmap_update_bits functions directly") intended
    to replace working inline helper functions with standard regmap
    calls.  However, it also inverted the set/clear logic of the "CORE ADJ
    Allowed" bit.  That patch was clearly never tested, since without that
    bit cleared, the core VDCDC1 voltage output does not react to I2C
    configuration changes.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by clearing the bit as in the original,
    correct implementation.  Note for stable back porting that, due to
    subsequent driver churn, this patch will not apply on every kernel
    version.

    KEYS: fix keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring() to not leak thread keyrings
    
    [ Upstream commit c9f838d104fed6f2f61d68164712e3204bf5271b ]
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-7472.
    
    Running the following program as an unprivileged user exhausts kernel
    memory by leaking thread keyrings:
    
            #include <keyutils.h>
    
            int main()
            {
                    for (;;)

            }
    
    Fix it by only creating a new thread keyring if there wasn't one before.
    To make things more consistent, make install_thread_keyring_to_cred()
    and install_process_keyring_to_cred() both return 0 if the corresponding
    keyring is already present.

    Userspace should not be able to do things with the "dead" key type as it
    doesn't have some of the helper functions set upon it that the kernel
    needs.  Attempting to use it may cause the kernel to crash.
    
    Fix this by changing the name of the type to ".dead" so that it's rejected
    up front on userspace syscalls by key_get_type_from_user().

    ones, certainly those prior to:

    KEYS: Disallow keyrings beginning with '.' to be joined as session keyrings
    
    [ Upstream commit ee8f844e3c5a73b999edf733df1c529d6503ec2f ]
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-9604.
    
    Keyrings whose name begin with a '.' are special internal keyrings and so
    userspace isn't allowed to create keyrings by this name to prevent
    shadowing.  However, the patch that added the guard didn't fix
    KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING.  Not only can that create dot-named keyrings,
    it can also subscribe to them as a session keyring if they grant SEARCH
    permission to the user.
    
    This, for example, allows a root process to set .builtin_trusted_keys as
    its session keyring, at which point it has full access because now the
    possessor permissions are added.  This permits root to add extra public
    keys, thereby bypassing module verification.
    
    This also affects kexec and IMA.
    
    This can be tested by (as root):
    
            keyctl session .builtin_trusted_keys
            keyctl add user a a @s
            keyctl list @s
    
    which on my test box gives me:
    
            2 keys in keyring:
            180010936: ---lswrv     0     0 asymmetric: Build time autogenerated kernel key: ae3d4a31b82daa8e1a75b49dc2bba949fd992a05

    powerpc/kprobe: Fix oops when kprobed on 'stdu' instruction
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e1ba4f27f018742a1aa95d11e35106feba08ec1 ]
    
    If we set a kprobe on a 'stdu' instruction on powerpc64, we see a kernel
    OOPS:
    
      Bad kernel stack pointer cd93c840 at c000000000009868
      Oops: Bad kernel stack pointer, sig: 6 [#1]

      LR [c000000000006208] program_check_common+0x108/0x180
    
    On a 64-bit system when the user probes on a 'stdu' instruction, the kernel does
    not emulate actual store in emulate_step() because it may corrupt the exception
    frame. So the kernel does the actual store operation in exception return code
    i.e. resume_kernel().
    
    resume_kernel() loads the saved stack pointer from memory using lwz, which only
    loads the low 32-bits of the address, causing the kernel crash.
    
    Fix this by loading the 64-bit value instead.

    cifs: Do not send echoes before Negotiate is complete
    
    [ Upstream commit 62a6cfddcc0a5313e7da3e8311ba16226fe0ac10 ]
    
    commit 4fcd1813e640 ("Fix reconnect to not defer smb3 session reconnect
    long after socket reconnect") added support for Negotiate requests to
    be initiated by echo calls.
    
    To avoid delays in calling echo after a reconnect, I added the patch
    introduced by the commit b8c600120fc8 ("Call echo service immediately
    after socket reconnect").
    
    This has however caused a regression with cifs shares which do not have
    support for echo calls to trigger Negotiate requests. On connections
    which need to call Negotiation, the echo calls trigger an error which
    triggers a reconnect which in turn triggers another echo call. This
    results in a loop which is only broken when an operation is performed on
    the cifs share. For an idle share, it can DOS a server.
    
    The patch uses the smb_operation can_echo() for cifs so that it is
    called only if connection has been already been setup.

    zram: do not use copy_page with non-page aligned address
    
    [ Upstream commit d72e9a7a93e4f8e9e52491921d99e0c8aa89eb4e ]
    
    The copy_page is optimized memcpy for page-alinged address.  If it is
    used with non-page aligned address, it can corrupt memory which means
    system corruption.  With zram, it can happen with
    
    1. 64K architecture
    2. partial IO
    3. slub debug
    
    Partial IO need to allocate a page and zram allocates it via kmalloc.
    With slub debug, kmalloc(PAGE_SIZE) doesn't return page-size aligned
    address.  And finally, copy_page(mem, cmem) corrupts memory.
    
    So, this patch changes it to memcpy.
    
    Actuaully, we don't need to change zram_bvec_write part because zsmalloc
    returns page-aligned address in case of PAGE_SIZE class but it's not
    good to rely on the internal of zsmalloc.
    
    Note:
     When this patch is merged to stable, clear_page should be fixed, too.
     Unfortunately, recent zram removes it by "same page merge" feature so
     it's hard to backport this patch to -stable tree.
    
    I will handle it when I receive the mail from stable tree maintainer to
    merge this patch to backport.

    [ Upstream commit 4e7655fd4f47c23e5249ea260dc802f909a64611 ]
    
    The snd_use_lock_sync() (thus its implementation
    snd_use_lock_sync_helper()) has the 5 seconds timeout to break out of
    the sync loop.  It was introduced from the beginning, just to be
    "safer", in terms of avoiding the stupid bugs.
    
    However, as Ben Hutchings suggested, this timeout rather introduces a
    potential leak or use-after-free that was apparently fixed by the
    commit 2d7d54002e39 ("ALSA: seq: Fix race during FIFO resize"):
    for example, snd_seq_fifo_event_in() -> snd_seq_event_dup() ->
    copy_from_user() could block for a long time, and snd_use_lock_sync()
    goes timeout and still leaves the cell at releasing the pool.
    
    For fixing such a problem, we remove the break by the timeout while
    still keeping the warning.

    MIPS: KGDB: Use kernel context for sleeping threads
    
    [ Upstream commit 162b270c664dca2e0944308e92f9fcc887151a72 ]
    
    KGDB is a kernel debug stub and it can't be used to debug userland as it
    can only safely access kernel memory.
    
    On MIPS however KGDB has always got the register state of sleeping
    processes from the userland register context at the beginning of the
    kernel stack. This is meaningless for kernel threads (which never enter
    userland), and for user threads it prevents the user seeing what it is
    doing while in the kernel:
    
    (gdb) info threads
      Id   Target Id         Frame
      ...
      3    Thread 2 (kthreadd) 0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()
      2    Thread 1 (init)   0x000000007705c4b4 in ?? ()
      1    Thread -2 (shadowCPU0) 0xffffffff8012524c in arch_kgdb_breakpoint () at arch/mips/kernel/kgdb.c:201
    
    Get the register state instead from the (partial) kernel register
    context stored in the task's thread_struct for resume() to restore. All
    threads now correctly appear to be in context_switch():
    
    (gdb) info threads
      Id   Target Id         Frame
      ...
      3    Thread 2 (kthreadd) context_switch (rq=<optimized out>, cookie=..., next=<optimized out>, prev=0x0) at kernel/sched/core.c:2903
      2    Thread 1 (init)   context_switch (rq=<optimized out>, cookie=..., next=<optimized out>, prev=0x0) at kernel/sched/core.c:2903
      1    Thread -2 (shadowCPU0) 0xffffffff8012524c in arch_kgdb_breakpoint () at arch/mips/kernel/kgdb.c:201
    
    Call clobbered registers which aren't saved and exception registers
    (BadVAddr & Cause) which can't be easily determined without stack
    unwinding are reported as 0. The PC is taken from the return address,
    such that the state presented matches that found immediately after
    returning from resume().

    MIPS: Avoid BUG warning in arch_check_elf
    
    [ Upstream commit c46f59e90226fa5bfcc83650edebe84ae47d454b ]
    
    arch_check_elf contains a usage of current_cpu_data that will call
    smp_processor_id() with preemption enabled and therefore triggers a
    "BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible" warning when an fpxx
    executable is loaded.
    
    As a follow-up to commit b244614a60ab ("MIPS: Avoid a BUG warning during
    prctl(PR_SET_FP_MODE, ...)"), apply the same fix to arch_check_elf by
    using raw_current_cpu_data instead. The rationale quoted from the previous
    commit:
    
    "It is assumed throughout the kernel that if any CPU has an FPU, then
    all CPUs would have an FPU as well, so it is safe to perform the check
    with preemption enabled - change the code to use raw_ variant of the
    check to avoid the warning."

    s390/mm: fix CMMA vs KSM vs others
    
    [ Upstream commit a8f60d1fadf7b8b54449fcc9d6b15248917478ba ]
    
    On heavy paging with KSM I see guest data corruption. Turns out that
    KSM will add pages to its tree, where the mapping return true for
    pte_unused (or might become as such later).  KSM will unmap such pages
    and reinstantiate with different attributes (e.g. write protected or
    special, e.g. in replace_page or write_protect_page)). This uncovered
    a bug in our pagetable handling: We must remove the unused flag as
    soon as an entry becomes present again.

    An unbalanced and misplaced synchronous put was used to suspend the
    device on driver unbind, something which with a likewise misplaced
    pm_runtime_disable leads to external aborts when an open port is being
    removed.

    Fix this up by resuming the device before deregistering the port and by
    suspending and disabling runtime pm only after the port has been
    removed.
    
    Also make sure to disable autosuspend before disabling runtime pm so
    that the usage count is balanced and device actually suspended before
    returning.
    
    Note that due to a negative autosuspend delay being set in probe, the
    unbalanced put would actually suspend the device on first driver unbind,
    while rebinding and again unbinding would result in a negative
    power.usage_count.

    CIFS: store results of cifs_reopen_file to avoid infinite wait
    
    [ Upstream commit 1fa839b4986d648b907d117275869a0e46c324b9 ]
    
    This fixes Continuous Availability when errors during
    file reopen are encountered.
    
    cifs_user_readv and cifs_user_writev would wait for ever if
    results of cifs_reopen_file are not stored and for later inspection.
    
    In fact, results are checked and, in case of errors, a chain
    of function calls leading to reads and writes to be scheduled in
    a separate thread is skipped.
    These threads will wake up the corresponding waiters once reads
    and writes are done.
    
    However, given the return value is not stored, when rc is checked
    for errors a previous one (always zero) is inspected instead.
    This leads to pending reads/writes added to the list, making
    cifs_user_readv and cifs_user_writev wait for ever.

    [ Upstream commit a0918f1ce6a43ac980b42b300ec443c154970979 ]
    
    STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME can be received during node failover,
    causing the flag to be set and making the reconnect thread
    always unsuccessful, thereafter.
    
    Once the only place where it is set is removed, the remaining
    bits are rendered moot.
    
    Removing it does not prevent "mount" from failing when a non
    existent share is passed.
    
    What happens when the share really ceases to exist while the
    share is mounted is undefined now as much as it was before.

    The problem is that resize_stripes() releases new stripe_heads before assigning new
    slab cache to conf->slab_cache. If the shrinker function raid5_cache_scan() gets called
    after resize_stripes() starting releasing new stripes but right before new slab cache
    being assigned, it is possible that these new stripe_heads will be freed with the old
    slab_cache which was already been destoryed and that triggers this bug.

    crypto: ahash - Fix EINPROGRESS notification callback
    
    [ Upstream commit ef0579b64e93188710d48667cb5e014926af9f1b ]
    
    The ahash API modifies the request's callback function in order
    to clean up after itself in some corner cases (unaligned final
    and missing finup).
    
    When the request is complete ahash will restore the original
    callback and everything is fine.  However, when the request gets
    an EBUSY on a full queue, an EINPROGRESS callback is made while
    the request is still ongoing.
    
    In this case the ahash API will incorrectly call its own callback.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by creating a temporary request
    object on the stack which is used to relay EINPROGRESS back to
    the original completion function.
    
    This patch also adds code to preserve the original flags value.

    sysfs: be careful of error returns from ops->show()
    
    [ Upstream commit c8a139d001a1aab1ea8734db14b22dac9dd143b6 ]
    
    ops->show() can return a negative error code.
    Commit 65da3484d9be ("sysfs: correctly handle short reads on PREALLOC attrs.")
    (in v4.4) caused this to be stored in an unsigned 'size_t' variable, so errors
    would look like large numbers.
    As a result, if an error is returned, sysfs_kf_read() will return the
    value of 'count', typically 4096.
    
    Commit 17d0774f8068 ("sysfs: correctly handle read offset on PREALLOC attrs")
    (in v4.8) extended this error to use the unsigned large 'len' as a size for
    memmove().
    Consequently, if ->show returns an error, then the first read() on the
    sysfs file will return 4096 and could return uninitialized memory to
    user-space.
    If the application performs a subsequent read, this will trigger a memmove()
    with extremely large count, and is likely to crash the machine is bizarre ways.
    
    This bug can currently only be triggered by reading from an md
    sysfs attribute declared with __ATTR_PREALLOC() during the
    brief period between when mddev_put() deletes an mddev from
    the ->all_mddevs list, and when mddev_delayed_delete() - which is
    scheduled on a workqueue - completes.
    Before this, an error won't be returned by the ->show()
    After this, the ->show() won't be called.
    
    I can reproduce it reliably only by putting delay like
            usleep_range(500000,700000);
    early in mddev_delayed_delete(). Then after creating an
    md device md0 run
      echo clear > /sys/block/md0/md/array_state; cat /sys/block/md0/md/array_state
    
    The bug can be triggered without the usleep.

    staging: android: ashmem: lseek failed due to no FMODE_LSEEK.
    
    [ Upstream commit 97fbfef6bd597888485b653175fb846c6998b60c ]
    
    vfs_llseek will check whether the file mode has
    FMODE_LSEEK, no return failure. But ashmem can be
    lseek, so add FMODE_LSEEK to ashmem file.
    
    Comment From Greg Hackmann:
            ashmem_llseek() passes the llseek() call through to the backing
            shmem file.  91360b02ab48 ("ashmem: use vfs_llseek()") changed
            this from directly calling the file's llseek() op into a VFS
            layer call.  This also adds a check for the FMODE_LSEEK bit, so
            without that bit ashmem_llseek() now always fails with -ESPIPE.

    ptrace: fix PTRACE_LISTEN race corrupting task->state
    
    [ Upstream commit 5402e97af667e35e54177af8f6575518bf251d51 ]
    
    In PT_SEIZED + LISTEN mode STOP/CONT signals cause a wakeup against
    __TASK_TRACED.  If this races with the ptrace_unfreeze_traced at the end
    of a PTRACE_LISTEN, this can wake the task /after/ the check against
    __TASK_TRACED, but before the reset of state to TASK_TRACED.  This
    causes it to instead clobber TASK_WAKING, allowing a subsequent wakeup
    against TRACED while the task is still on the rq wake_list, corrupting
    it.
    
    Oleg said:
     "The kernel can crash or this can lead to other hard-to-debug problems.
      In short, "task->state = TASK_TRACED" in ptrace_unfreeze_traced()
      assumes that nobody else can wake it up, but PTRACE_LISTEN breaks the
      contract. Obviusly it is very wrong to manipulate task->state if this
      task is already running, or WAKING, or it sleeps again"

    [ Upstream commit 7c856152cb92f8eee2df29ef325a1b1f43161aff ]
    
    We previously made sure that the reported disk capacity was less than

    support (CONFIG_LBDAF). However, this check assumed that the capacity
    was reported in units of 512 bytes.
    
    Add a sanity check function to ensure that we only enable disks if the

    [ Upstream commit 2c0b1df88b987a12d95ea1d6beaf01894f3cc725 ]
    
    The fixup code to rewind the source pointer in
    __asm_copy_from_user_{32,64}bit_rapf_loop() always rewound the source by
    a single unit (4 or 8 bytes), however this is insufficient if the fault
    didn't occur on the first load in the loop, as the source pointer will
    have been incremented but nothing will have been stored until all 4
    register [pairs] are loaded.
    
    Read the LSM_STEP field of TXSTATUS (which is already loaded into a
    register), a bit like the copy_to_user versions, to determine how many
    iterations of MGET[DL] have taken place, all of which need rewinding.

    metag/usercopy: Set flags before ADDZ
    
    [ Upstream commit fd40eee1290ad7add7aa665e3ce6b0f9fe9734b4 ]
    
    The fixup code for the copy_to_user rapf loops reads TXStatus.LSM_STEP
    to decide how far to rewind the source pointer. There is a special case
    for the last execution of an MGETL/MGETD, since it leaves LSM_STEP=0
    even though the number of MGETLs/MGETDs attempted was 4. This uses ADDZ
    which is conditional upon the Z condition flag, but the AND instruction
    which masked the TXStatus.LSM_STEP field didn't set the condition flags
    based on the result.
    
    Fix that now by using ANDS which does set the flags, and also marking
    the condition codes as clobbered by the inline assembly.

    metag/usercopy: Zero rest of buffer from copy_from_user
    
    [ Upstream commit 563ddc1076109f2b3f88e6d355eab7b6fd4662cb ]
    
    Currently we try to zero the destination for a failed read from userland
    in fixup code in the usercopy.c macros. The rest of the destination
    buffer is then zeroed from __copy_user_zeroing(), which is used for both
    copy_from_user() and __copy_from_user().
    
    Unfortunately we fail to zero in the fixup code as D1Ar1 is set to 0
    before the fixup code entry labels, and __copy_from_user() shouldn't even
    be zeroing the rest of the buffer.
    
    Move the zeroing out into copy_from_user() and rename
    __copy_user_zeroing() to raw_copy_from_user() since it no longer does
    any zeroing. This also conveniently matches the name needed for
    RAW_COPY_USER support in a later patch.

    Fix the error checking of the alignment adjustment code in

    error check when aligning the source buffer on a 2 or 4 byte boundary.
    
    If the destination buffer was unaligned it may have started to copy
    using byte or word accesses, which could well be at the start of a new
    (valid) source page. This would result in it appearing to have copied 1
    or 2 bytes at the end of the first (invalid) page rather than none at
    all.

    [ Upstream commit 88b1bf7268f56887ca88eb09c6fb0f4fc970121a ]
    
    Commit 4c6d9acce1f4 ("powerpc/mm: Add hooks for cxl") converted local
    TLB invalidates to global if the cxl driver is active. This is necessary
    because the CAPP snoops invalidations to forward them to the PSL on the
    cxl adapter. However one path was forgotten. native_flush_hash_range()
    still does local TLB invalidates, as found out the hard way recently.
    
    This patch fixes it by following the same logic as previously: if the
    cxl driver is active, the local TLB invalidates are 'upgraded' to
    global.

    powerpc: Don't try to fix up misaligned load-with-reservation instructions
    
    [ Upstream commit 48fe9e9488743eec9b7c1addd3c93f12f2123d54 ]
    
    In the past, there was only one load-with-reservation instruction,
    lwarx, and if a program attempted a lwarx on a misaligned address, it
    would take an alignment interrupt and the kernel handler would emulate
    it as though it was lwzx, which was not really correct, but benign since
    it is loading the right amount of data, and the lwarx should be paired
    with a stwcx. to the same address, which would also cause an alignment
    interrupt which would result in a SIGBUS being delivered to the process.
    
    We now have 5 different sizes of load-with-reservation instruction. Of
    those, lharx and ldarx cause an immediate SIGBUS by luck since their
    entries in aligninfo[] overlap instructions which were not fixed up, but
    lqarx overlaps with lhz and will be emulated as such. lbarx can never
    generate an alignment interrupt since it only operates on 1 byte.
    
    To straighten this out and fix the lqarx case, this adds code to detect
    the l[hwdq]arx instructions and return without fixing them up, resulting
    in a SIGBUS being delivered to the process.

    kvm: arm/arm64: Fix locking for kvm_free_stage2_pgd
    
    [ Upstream commit 8b3405e345b5a098101b0c31b264c812bba045d9 ]
    
    In kvm_free_stage2_pgd() we don't hold the kvm->mmu_lock while calling
    unmap_stage2_range() on the entire memory range for the guest. This could
    cause problems with other callers (e.g, munmap on a memslot) trying to
    unmap a range. And since we have to unmap the entire Guest memory range

    tpm: add sleep only for retry in i2c_nuvoton_write_status()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0afb7118ae021e80ecf70f5a3336e0935505518a ]
    
    Currently, there is an unnecessary 1 msec delay added in
    i2c_nuvoton_write_status() for the successful case. This
    function is called multiple times during send() and recv(),
    which implies adding multiple extra delays for every TPM
    operation.
    
    This patch calls usleep_range() only if retry is to be done.

    tpm: msleep() delays - replace with usleep_range() in i2c nuvoton driver
    
    [ Upstream commit a233a0289cf9a96ef9b42c730a7621ccbf9a6f98 ]
    
    Commit 500462a9de65 "timers: Switch to a non-cascading wheel" replaced
    the 'classic' timer wheel, which aimed for near 'exact' expiry of the
    timers.  Their analysis was that the vast majority of timeout timers
    are used as safeguards, not as real timers, and are cancelled or
    rearmed before expiration.  The only exception noted to this were
    networking timers with a small expiry time.
    
    Not included in the analysis was the TPM polling timer, which resulted
    in a longer normal delay and, every so often, a very long delay.  The
    non-cascading wheel delay is based on CONFIG_HZ.  For a description of
    the different rings and their delays, refer to the comments in
    kernel/time/timer.c.
    
    Below are the delays given for rings 0 - 2, which explains the longer
    "normal" delays and the very, long delays as seen on systems with
    CONFIG_HZ 250.
    
    * HZ 1000 steps
     * Level Offset  Granularity            Range
     *  0      0         1 ms                0 ms - 63 ms
     *  1     64         8 ms               64 ms - 511 ms
     *  2    128        64 ms              512 ms - 4095 ms (512ms - ~4s)
    
    * HZ  250
     * Level Offset  Granularity            Range
     *  0      0         4 ms                0 ms - 255 ms
     *  1     64        32 ms              256 ms - 2047 ms (256ms - ~2s)
     *  2    128       256 ms             2048 ms - 16383 ms (~2s - ~16s)
    
    Below is a comparison of extending the TPM with 1000 measurements,
    using msleep() vs. usleep_delay() when configured for 1000 hz vs. 250
    hz, before and after commit 500462a9de65.
    
    linux-4.7 | msleep() usleep_range()
    1000 hz: 0m44.628s | 1m34.497s 29.243s
    250 hz: 1m28.510s | 4m49.269s 32.386s
    
    linux-4.7  | min-max (msleep)  min-max (usleep_range)
    1000 hz: 0:017 - 2:760s | 0:015 - 3:967s    0:014 - 0:418s
    250 hz: 0:028 - 1:954s | 0:040 - 4:096s    0:016 - 0:816s
    
    This patch replaces the msleep() with usleep_range() calls in the
    i2c nuvoton driver with a consistent max range value.

    iscsi-target: Drop work-around for legacy GlobalSAN initiator
    
    [ Upstream commit 1c99de981f30b3e7868b8d20ce5479fa1c0fea46 ]
    
    Once upon a time back in 2009, a work-around was added to support
    the GlobalSAN iSCSI initiator v3.3 for MacOSX, which during login
    did not propose nor respond to MaxBurstLength, FirstBurstLength,
    DefaultTime2Wait and DefaultTime2Retain keys.
    
    The work-around in iscsi_check_proposer_for_optional_reply()
    allowed the missing keys to be proposed, but did not require
    waiting for a response before moving to full feature phase
    operation.  This allowed GlobalSAN v3.3 to work out-of-the
    box, and for many years we didn't run into login interopt
    issues with any other initiators..
    
    Until recently, when Martin tried a QLogic 57840S iSCSI Offload
    HBA on Windows 2016 which completed login, but subsequently
    failed with:
    
        Got unknown iSCSI OpCode: 0x43
    
    The issue was QLogic MSFT side did not propose DefaultTime2Wait +
    DefaultTime2Retain, so LIO proposes them itself, and immediately
    transitions to full feature phase because of the GlobalSAN hack.
    However, the QLogic MSFT side still attempts to respond to
    DefaultTime2Retain + DefaultTime2Wait, even though LIO has set
    ISCSI_FLAG_LOGIN_NEXT_STAGE3 + ISCSI_FLAG_LOGIN_TRANSIT
    in last login response.
    
    So while the QLogic MSFT side should have been proposing these
    two keys to start, it was doing the correct thing per RFC-3720
    attempting to respond to proposed keys before transitioning to
    full feature phase.
    
    All that said, recent versions of GlobalSAN iSCSI (v5.3.0.541)
    does correctly propose the four keys during login, making the
    original work-around moot.
    
    So in order to allow QLogic MSFT to run unmodified as-is, go
    ahead and drop this long standing work-around.

    Using pmd_present() to determine present/non-present for hugetlb is not

    _PAGE_PRESENT) for historical reason and it can misjudge hugetlb state.

    On this Dell AIO machine, the lineout jack does not work.
    
    We found the pin 0x1a is assigned to lineout on this machine, and in
    the past, we applied ALC298_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE to fix the
    heaset-set mic problem for this machine, this fixup will redefine
    the pin 0x1a to headphone-mic, as a result the lineout doesn't
    work anymore.
    
    After consulting with Dell, they told us this machine doesn't support
    microphone via headset jack, so we add a new fixup which only defines
    the pin 0x18 as the headset-mic.
    
    [rearranged the fixup insertion position by tiwai in order to make the
     merge with other branches easier -- tiwai]

    drm/vmwgfx: fix integer overflow in vmw_surface_define_ioctl()
    
    [ Upstream commit e7e11f99564222d82f0ce84bd521e57d78a6b678 ]
    
    In vmw_surface_define_ioctl(), the 'num_sizes' is the sum of the
    'req->mip_levels' array. This array can be assigned any value from
    the user space. As both the 'num_sizes' and the array is uint32_t,
    it is easy to make 'num_sizes' overflow. The later 'mip_levels' is
    used as the loop count. This can lead an oob write. Add the check of
    'req->mip_levels' to avoid this.

    Before memory allocations vmw_surface_define_ioctl() checks the
    upper-bounds of a user-supplied size, but does not check if the
    supplied size is 0.
    
    Add check to avoid NULL pointer dereferences.

    iscsi-target: Fix TMR reference leak during session shutdown
    
    [ Upstream commit efb2ea770bb3b0f40007530bc8b0c22f36e1c5eb ]
    
    This patch fixes a iscsi-target specific TMR reference leak
    during session shutdown, that could occur when a TMR was
    quiesced before the hand-off back to iscsi-target code
    via transport_cmd_check_stop_to_fabric().
    
    The reference leak happens because iscsit_free_cmd() was
    incorrectly skipping the final target_put_sess_cmd() for
    TMRs when transport_generic_free_cmd() returned zero because
    the se_cmd->cmd_kref did not reach zero, due to the missing
    se_cmd assignment in original code.
    
    The result was iscsi_cmd and it's associated se_cmd memory
    would be freed once se_sess->sess_cmd_map where released,
    but the associated se_tmr_req was leaked and remained part
    of se_device->dev_tmr_list.
    
    This bug would manfiest itself as kernel paging request
    OOPsen in core_tmr_lun_reset(), when a left-over se_tmr_req
    attempted to dereference it's se_cmd pointer that had
    already been released during normal session shutdown.
    
    To address this bug, go ahead and treat ISCSI_OP_SCSI_CMD
    and ISCSI_OP_SCSI_TMFUNC the same when there is an extra
    se_cmd->cmd_kref to drop in iscsit_free_cmd(), and use
    op_scsi to signal __iscsit_free_cmd() when the former
    needs to clear any further iscsi related I/O state.

    ubi/upd: Always flush after prepared for an update
    
    [ Upstream commit 9cd9a21ce070be8a918ffd3381468315a7a76ba6 ]
    
    In commit 6afaf8a484cb ("UBI: flush wl before clearing update marker") I
    managed to trigger and fix a similar bug. Now here is another version of
    which I assumed it wouldn't matter back then but it turns out UBI has a
    check for it and will error out like this:
    
    |ubi0 warning: validate_vid_hdr: inconsistent used_ebs
    |ubi0 error: validate_vid_hdr: inconsistent VID header at PEB 592
    
    All you need to trigger this is? "ubiupdatevol /dev/ubi0_0 file" + a
    powercut in the middle of the operation.
    ubi_start_update() sets the update-marker and puts all EBs on the erase
    list. After that userland can proceed to write new data while the old EB
    aren't erased completely. A powercut at this point is usually not that
    much of a tragedy. UBI won't give read access to the static volume
    because it has the update marker. It will most likely set the corrupted
    flag because it misses some EBs.
    So we are all good. Unless the size of the image that has been written
    differs from the old image in the magnitude of at least one EB. In that
    case UBI will find two different values for `used_ebs' and refuse to
    attach the image with the error message mentioned above.
    
    So in order not to get in the situation, the patch will ensure that we
    wait until everything is removed before it tries to write any data.
    The alternative would be to detect such a case and remove all EBs at the
    attached time after we processed the volume-table and see the
    update-marker set. The patch looks bigger and I doubt it is worth it
    since usually the write() will wait from time to time for a new EB since
    usually there not that many spare EB that can be used.

    s390/uaccess: get_user() should zero on failure (again)
    
    [ Upstream commit d09c5373e8e4eaaa09233552cbf75dc4c4f21203 ]
    
    Commit fd2d2b191fe7 ("s390: get_user() should zero on failure")
    intended to fix s390's get_user() implementation which did not zero
    the target operand if the read from user space faulted. Unfortunately
    the patch has no effect: the corresponding inline assembly specifies
    that the operand is only written to ("=") and the previous value is
    discarded.
    
    Therefore the compiler is free to and actually does omit the zero
    initialization.
    
    To fix this simply change the contraint modifier to "+", so the
    compiler cannot omit the initialization anymore.

    USB: Proper handling of Race Condition when two USB class drivers try to call init_usb_class simultaneously
    
    [ Upstream commit 2f86a96be0ccb1302b7eee7855dbee5ce4dc5dfb ]
    
    There is race condition when two USB class drivers try to call
    init_usb_class at the same time and leads to crash.
    code path: probe->usb_register_dev->init_usb_class
    
    To solve this, mutex locking has been added in init_usb_class() and
    destroy_usb_class().
    
    As pointed by Alan, removed "if (usb_class)" test from destroy_usb_class()
    because usb_class can never be NULL there.

    ACPI: Fix incompatibility with mcount-based function graph tracing
    
    [ Upstream commit 61b79e16c68d703dde58c25d3935d67210b7d71b ]
    
    Paul Menzel reported a warning:
    
      WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 774 at /build/linux-ROBWaj/linux-4.9.13/kernel/trace/trace_functions_graph.c:233 ftrace_return_to_handler+0x1aa/0x1e0
      Bad frame pointer: expected f6919d98, received f6919db0
        from func acpi_pm_device_sleep_wake return to c43b6f9d
    
    The warning means that function graph tracing is broken for the
    acpi_pm_device_sleep_wake() function.  That's because the ACPI Makefile
    unconditionally sets the '-Os' gcc flag to optimize for size.  That's an
    issue because mcount-based function graph tracing is incompatible with
    '-Os' on x86, thanks to the following gcc bug:
    
      https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=42109
    
    I have another patch pending which will ensure that mcount-based
    function graph tracing is never used with CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE on
    x86.
    
    But this patch is needed in addition to that one because the ACPI
    Makefile overrides that config option for no apparent reason.  It has
    had this flag since the beginning of git history, and there's no related
    comment, so I don't know why it's there.  As far as I can tell, there's
    no reason for it to be there.  The appropriate behavior is for it to
    honor CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_{SIZE,PERFORMANCE} like the rest of the
    kernel.

    virtio_balloon: init 1st buffer in stats vq
    
    [ Upstream commit fc8653228c8588a120f6b5dad6983b7b61ff669e ]
    
    When init_vqs runs, virtio_balloon.stats is either uninitialized or
    contains stale values. The host updates its state with garbage data
    because it has no way of knowing that this is just a marker buffer
    used for signaling.
    
    This patch updates the stats before pushing the initial buffer.
    
    Alternative fixes:
    * Push an empty buffer in init_vqs. Not easily done with the current
      virtio implementation and violates the spec "Driver MUST supply the
      same subset of statistics in all buffers submitted to the statsq".
    * Push a buffer with invalid tags in init_vqs. Violates the same
      spec clause, plus "invalid tag" is not really defined.
    
    Note: the spec says:
            When using the legacy interface, the device SHOULD ignore all values in
            the first buffer in the statsq supplied by the driver after device
            initialization. Note: Historically, drivers supplied an uninitialized
            buffer in the first buffer.
    
    Unfortunately QEMU does not seem to implement the recommendation
    even for the legacy interface.

    powerpc: Disable HFSCR[TM] if TM is not supported
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ed23e1bae8bf7e37fd555066550a00b95a3a98b ]
    
    On Power8 & Power9 the early CPU inititialisation in __init_HFSCR()
    turns on HFSCR[TM] (Hypervisor Facility Status and Control Register
    [Transactional Memory]), but that doesn't take into account that TM
    might be disabled by CPU features, or disabled by the kernel being built
    with CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n.
    
    So later in boot, when we have setup the CPU features, clear HSCR[TM] if
    the TM CPU feature has been disabled. We use CPU_FTR_TM_COMP to account
    for the CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n case.
    
    Without this a KVM guest might try use TM, even if told not to, and
    cause an oops in the host kernel. Typically the oops is seen in
    __kvmppc_vcore_entry() and may or may not be fatal to the host, but is
    always bad news.
    
    In practice all shipping CPU revisions do support TM, and all host
    kernels we are aware of build with TM support enabled, so no one should
    actually be able to hit this in the wild.

    [ Upstream commit ce4b4f228e51219b0b79588caf73225b08b5b779 ]
    
    We were accidentally only overriding the first VRAM placement. For BOs
    with the RADEON_GEM_NO_CPU_ACCESS flag set,
    radeon_ttm_placement_from_domain creates a second VRAM placment with
    fpfn == 0. If VRAM is almost full, the first VRAM placement with
    fpfn > 0 may not work, but the second one with fpfn == 0 always will
    (the BO's current location trivially satisfies it). Because "moving"
    the BO to its current location puts it back on the LRU list, this
    results in an infinite loop.

    buffer allocation fails, the routine returns immediately without
    unlinking its URB from the control endpoint, eventually leading to
    linked-list corruption.

    xen/acpi: upload PM state from init-domain to Xen
    
    [ Upstream commit 1914f0cd203c941bba72f9452c8290324f1ef3dc ]
    
    This was broken in commit cd979883b9ed ("xen/acpi-processor:

    xen/manage.c) and thus xen_resume_notifier never get called on
    the initial-domain at resume (it is if running as guest.)
    
    The rationale for the breaking change was that upload_pm_data()
    potentially does blocking work in syscore_resume(). This patch
    addresses the original issue by scheduling upload_pm_data() to
    execute in workqueue context.

    mmc: sdhci: Do not disable interrupts while waiting for clock
    
    [ Upstream commit e2ebfb2142acefecc2496e71360f50d25726040b ]
    
    Disabling interrupts for even a millisecond can cause problems for some
    devices. That can happen when sdhci changes clock frequency because it
    waits for the clock to become stable under a spin lock.
    
    The spin lock is not necessary here. Anything that is racing with changes
    to the I/O state is already broken. The mmc core already provides
    synchronization via "claiming" the host.
    
    Although the spin lock probably should be removed from the code paths that
    lead to this point, such a patch would touch too much code to be suitable
    for stable trees. Consequently, for this patch, just drop the spin lock
    while waiting.

    Code analysis shows that intf is set to NULL in usb_disable_device() prior
    to setting actconfig to NULL. At the same time, usb_runtime_idle() does not
    lock the usb device, and neither does any of the functions in the
    traceback. This means that there is no protection against a race condition
    where usb_disable_device() is removing dev->actconfig->interface[] pointers
    while those are being accessed from autosuspend_check().
    
    To solve the problem, synchronize and validate device state between
    autosuspend_check() and usb_disconnect().

    usb: gadget: f_uvc: Fix SuperSpeed companion descriptor's wBytesPerInterval
    
    [ Upstream commit 09424c50b7dff40cb30011c09114404a4656e023 ]
    
    The streaming_maxburst module parameter is 0 offset (0..15)
    so we must add 1 while using it for wBytesPerInterval
    calculation for the SuperSpeed companion descriptor.
    
    Without this host uvcvideo driver will always see the wrong
    wBytesPerInterval for SuperSpeed uvc gadget and may not find
    a suitable video interface endpoint.
    e.g. for streaming_maxburst = 0 case it will always
    fail as wBytePerInterval was evaluating to 0.

    s390/decompressor: fix initrd corruption caused by bss clear
    
    [ Upstream commit d82c0d12c92705ef468683c9b7a8298dd61ed191 ]
    
    Reorder the operations in decompress_kernel() to ensure initrd is moved
    to a safe location before the bss section is zeroed.
    
    During decompression bss can overlap with the initrd and this can
    corrupt the initrd contents depending on the size of the compressed
    kernel (which affects where the initrd is placed by the bootloader) and
    the size of the bss section of the decompressor.
    
    Also use the correct initrd size when checking for overlaps with
    parmblock.

    ALSA: seq: Fix racy cell insertions during snd_seq_pool_done()
    
    [ Upstream commit c520ff3d03f0b5db7146d9beed6373ad5d2a5e0e ]
    
    When snd_seq_pool_done() is called, it marks the closing flag to
    refuse the further cell insertions.  But snd_seq_pool_done() itself
    doesn't clear the cells but just waits until all cells are cleared by
    the caller side.  That is, it's racy, and this leads to the endless
    stall as syzkaller spotted.
    
    This patch addresses the racy by splitting the setup of pool->closing
    flag out of snd_seq_pool_done(), and calling it properly before
    snd_seq_pool_done().

    scsi: libsas: fix ata xfer length
    
    [ Upstream commit 9702c67c6066f583b629cf037d2056245bb7a8e6 ]
    
    The total ata xfer length may not be calculated properly, in that we do
    not use the proper method to get an sg element dma length.
    
    According to the code comment, sg_dma_len() should be used after
    dma_map_sg() is called.
    
    This issue was found by turning on the SMMUv3 in front of the hisi_sas
    controller in hip07. Multiple sg elements were being combined into a
    single element, but the original first element length was being use as
    the total xfer length.

    tty: pty: Fix ldisc flush after userspace become aware of the data already
    
    [ Upstream commit 77dae6134440420bac334581a3ccee94cee1c054 ]
    
    While using emacs, cat or others' commands in konsole with recent
    kernels, I have met many times that CTRL-C freeze konsole. After
    konsole freeze I can't type anything, then I have to open a new one,
    it is very annoying.
    
    See bug report:
    https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175283
    
    The platform in that bug report is Solaris, but now the pty in linux
    has the same problem or the same behavior as Solaris :)
    
    It has high possibility to trigger the problem follow steps below:
    Note: In my test, BigFile is a text file whose size is bigger than 1G
    1:open konsole
    1:cat BigFile
    2:CTRL-C
    
    After some digging, I find out the reason is that commit 1d1d14da12e7
    ("pty: Fix buffer flush deadlock") changes the behavior of pty_flush_buffer.
    
    Thread A                                 Thread B
    --------                                 --------
    1:n_tty_poll return POLLIN
                                             2:CTRL-C trigger pty_flush_buffer
                                                 tty_buffer_flush
                                                   n_tty_flush_buffer
    3:attempt to check count of chars:
      ioctl(fd, TIOCINQ, &available)
      available is equal to 0
    
    4:read(fd, buffer, avaiable)
      return 0
    
    5:konsole close fd
    
    Yes, I know we could use the same patch included in the BUG report as
    a workaround for linux platform too. But I think the data in ldisc is
    belong to application of another side, we shouldn't clear it when we
    want to flush write buffer of this side in pty_flush_buffer. So I think
    it is better to disable ldisc flush in pty_flush_buffer, because its new
    hehavior bring no benefit except that it mess up the behavior between
    POLLIN, and TIOCINQ or FIONREAD.
    
    Also I find no flush_buffer function in others' tty driver has the
    same behavior as current pty_flush_buffer.

    The gadget code exports the bitfield for serial status changes
    over the wire in its internal endianness. The fix is to convert
    to little endian before sending it over the wire.

    ext4: mark inode dirty after converting inline directory
    
    [ Upstream commit b9cf625d6ecde0d372e23ae022feead72b4228a6 ]
    
    If ext4_convert_inline_data() was called on a directory with inline
    data, the filesystem was left in an inconsistent state (as considered by
    e2fsck) because the file size was not increased to cover the new block.
    This happened because the inode was not marked dirty after i_disksize
    was updated.  Fix this by marking the inode dirty at the end of
    ext4_finish_convert_inline_dir().
    
    This bug was probably not noticed before because most users mark the
    inode dirty afterwards for other reasons.  But if userspace executed
    FS_IOC_SET_ENCRYPTION_POLICY with invalid parameters, as exercised by
    'kvm-xfstests -c adv generic/396', then the inode was never marked dirty
    after updating i_disksize.

    futex: Fix potential use-after-free in FUTEX_REQUEUE_PI
    
    [ Upstream commit c236c8e95a3d395b0494e7108f0d41cf36ec107c ]
    
    While working on the futex code, I stumbled over this potential
    use-after-free scenario. Dmitry triggered it later with syzkaller.
    
    pi_mutex is a pointer into pi_state, which we drop the reference on in
    unqueue_me_pi(). So any access to that pointer after that is bad.
    
    Since other sites already do rt_mutex_unlock() with hb->lock held, see
    for example futex_lock_pi(), simply move the unlock before
    unqueue_me_pi().

    ARM: at91: pm: cpu_idle: switch DDR to power-down mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 60b89f1928af80b546b5c3fd8714a62f6f4b8844 ]
    
    On some DDR controllers, compatible with the sama5d3 one,
    the sequence to enter/exit/re-enter the self-refresh mode adds
    more constrains than what is currently written in the at91_idle
    driver. An actual access to the DDR chip is needed between exit
    and re-enter of this mode which is somehow difficult to implement.
    This sequence can completely hang the SoC. It is particularly
    experienced on parts which embed a L2 cache if the code run
    between IDLE calls fits in it...
    
    Moreover, as the intention is to enter and exit pretty rapidly
    from IDLE, the power-down mode is a good candidate.
    
    So now we use power-down instead of self-refresh. As we can
    simplify the code for sama5d3 compatible DDR controllers,
    we instantiate a new sama5d3_ddr_standby() function.

    usb-core: Add LINEAR_FRAME_INTR_BINTERVAL USB quirk
    
    [ Upstream commit 3243367b209faed5c320a4e5f9a565ee2a2ba958 ]
    
    Some USB 2.0 devices erroneously report millisecond values in
    bInterval. The generic config code manages to catch most of them,
    but in some cases it's not completely enough.
    
    The case at stake here is a USB 2.0 braille device, which wants to
    announce 10ms and thus sets bInterval to 10, but with the USB 2.0
    computation that yields to 64ms.  It happens that one can type fast
    enough to reach this interval and get the device buffers overflown,
    leading to problematic latencies.  The generic config code does not
    catch this case because the 64ms is considered a sane enough value.
    
    This change thus adds a USB_QUIRK_LINEAR_FRAME_INTR_BINTERVAL quirk
    to mark devices which actually report milliseconds in bInterval,
    and marks Vario Ultra devices as needing it.

    md/raid1/10: fix potential deadlock
    
    [ Upstream commit 61eb2b43b99ebdc9bc6bc83d9792257b243e7cb3 ]
    
    Neil Brown pointed out a potential deadlock in raid 10 code with
    bio_split/chain. The raid1 code could have the same issue, but recent
    barrier rework makes it less likely to happen. The deadlock happens in
    below sequence:
    
    1. generic_make_request(bio), this will set current->bio_list
    2. raid10_make_request will split bio to bio1 and bio2
    3. __make_request(bio1), wait_barrer, add underlayer disk bio to
    current->bio_list
    4. __make_request(bio2), wait_barrer
    
    If raise_barrier happens between 3 & 4, since wait_barrier runs at 3,
    raise_barrier waits for IO completion from 3. And since raise_barrier
    sets barrier, 4 waits for raise_barrier. But IO from 3 can't be
    dispatched because raid10_make_request() doesn't finished yet.
    
    The solution is to adjust the IO ordering. Quotes from Neil:
    "
    It is much safer to:
    
        if (need to split) {
            split = bio_split(bio, ...)
            bio_chain(...)
            make_request_fn(split);
            generic_make_request(bio);
       } else
            make_request_fn(mddev, bio);
    
    This way we first process the initial section of the bio (in 'split')
    which will queue some requests to the underlying devices.  These
    requests will be queued in generic_make_request.
    Then we queue the remainder of the bio, which will be added to the end
    of the generic_make_request queue.
    Then we return.
    generic_make_request() will pop the lower-level device requests off the
    queue and handle them first.  Then it will process the remainder
    of the original bio once the first section has been fully processed.
    "
    
    Note, this only happens in read path. In write path, the bio is flushed to
    underlaying disks either by blk flush (from schedule) or offladed to raid1/10d.
    It's queued in current->bio_list.

    usb: host: xhci-plat: Fix timeout on removal of hot pluggable xhci controllers
    
    [ Upstream commit dcc7620cad5ad1326a78f4031a7bf4f0e5b42984 ]
    
    Upstream commit 98d74f9ceaef ("xhci: fix 10 second timeout on removal of
    PCI hotpluggable xhci controllers") fixes a problem with hot pluggable PCI
    xhci controllers which can result in excessive timeouts, to the point where
    the system reports a deadlock.
    
    The same problem is seen with hot pluggable xhci controllers using the
    xhci-plat driver, such as the driver used for Type-C ports on rk3399.
    Similar to hot-pluggable PCI controllers, the driver for this chip
    removes the xhci controller from the system when the Type-C cable is
    disconnected.
    
    The solution for PCI devices works just as well for non-PCI devices
    and avoids the problem.

    [ Upstream commit 4b5347a24a0f2d3272032c120664b484478455de ]
    
    When building for microMIPS we need to ensure that the assembler always
    knows that there is code at the target of a branch or jump. Recent
    toolchains will fail to link a microMIPS kernel when this isn't the case
    due to what it thinks is a branch to non-microMIPS code.

    This is due to inline assembly labels in spinlock.h not being followed
    by an instruction mnemonic, either due to a .subsection pseudo-op or the
    end of the inline asm block.
    
    Fix this with a .insn direction after such labels.

    MIPS: Force o32 fp64 support on 32bit MIPS64r6 kernels
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e6c7747730296a6d4fd700894286db1132598c4 ]
    
    When a 32-bit kernel is configured to support MIPS64r6 (CPU_MIPS64_R6),
    MIPS_O32_FP64_SUPPORT won't be selected as it should be because
    MIPS32_O32 is disabled (o32 is already the default ABI available on
    32-bit kernels).
    
    This results in userland FP breakage as CP0_Status.FR is read-only 1
    since r6 (when an FPU is present) so __enable_fpu() will fail to clear
    FR. This causes the FPU emulator to get used which will incorrectly
    emulate 32-bit FPU registers.
    
    Force o32 fp64 support in this case by also selecting
    MIPS_O32_FP64_SUPPORT from CPU_MIPS64_R6 if 32BIT.

    VERIFY_16 to be supported, and does not handle the returned
    CHECK_CONDITION properly, resulting in an infinite loop.

    target/pscsi: Fix TYPE_TAPE + TYPE_MEDIMUM_CHANGER export
    
    [ Upstream commit a04e54f2c35823ca32d56afcd5cea5b783e2f51a ]
    
    The following fixes a divide by zero OOPs with TYPE_TAPE
    due to pscsi_tape_read_blocksize() failing causing a zero
    sd->sector_size being propigated up via dev_attrib.hw_block_size.
    
    It also fixes another long-standing bug where TYPE_TAPE and
    TYPE_MEDIMUM_CHANGER where using pscsi_create_type_other(),
    which does not call scsi_device_get() to take the device
    reference.  Instead, rename pscsi_create_type_rom() to
    pscsi_create_type_nondisk() and use it for all cases.
    
    Finally, also drop a dump_stack() in pscsi_get_blocks() for
    non TYPE_DISK, which in modern target-core can get invoked
    via target_sense_desc_format() during CHECK_CONDITION.

    serial: samsung: Continue to work if DMA request fails
    
    [ Upstream commit f98c7bce570bdbe344b74ff5daa7dfeef3f22929 ]
    
    If DMA is not available (even when configured in DeviceTree), the driver
    will fail the startup procedure thus making serial console not
    available.
    
    For example this causes boot failure on QEMU ARMv7 (Exynos4210, SMDKC210):

    DMA is not necessary for serial to work, so continue with UART startup

    ima: accept previously set IMA_NEW_FILE
    
    [ Upstream commit 1ac202e978e18f045006d75bd549612620c6ec3a ]
    
    Modifying the attributes of a file makes ima_inode_post_setattr reset
    the IMA cache flags. So if the file, which has just been created,
    is opened a second time before the first file descriptor is closed,
    verification fails since the security.ima xattr has not been written
    yet. We therefore have to look at the IMA_NEW_FILE even if the file
    already existed.
    
    With this patch there should no longer be an error when cat tries to
    open testfile:
    
    $ rm -f testfile
    $ ( echo test >&3 ; touch testfile ; cat testfile ) 3>testfile
    
    A file being new is no reason to accept that it is missing a digital
    signature demanded by the policy.

    staging: comedi: jr3_pci: cope with jiffies wraparound
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ec04a491825e08068e92bed0bba7821893b6433 ]
    
    The timer expiry routine `jr3_pci_poll_dev()` checks for expiry by
    checking whether the absolute value of `jiffies` (stored in local
    variable `now`) is greater than the expected expiry time in jiffy units.
    This will fail when `jiffies` wraps around.  Also, it seems to make

    staging: comedi: jr3_pci: fix possible null pointer dereference
    
    [ Upstream commit 45292be0b3db0b7f8286683b376e2d9f949d11f9 ]
    
    For some reason, the driver does not consider allocation of the
    subdevice private data to be a fatal error when attaching the COMEDI
    device.  It tests the subdevice private data pointer for validity at
    certain points, but omits some crucial tests.  In particular,
    `jr3_pci_auto_attach()` calls `jr3_pci_alloc_spriv()` to allocate and
    initialize the subdevice private data, but the same function
    subsequently dereferences the pointer to access the `next_time_min` and
    `next_time_max` members without checking it first.  The other missing
    test is in the timer expiry routine `jr3_pci_poll_dev()`, but it will
    crash before it gets that far.
    
    Fix the bug by returning `-ENOMEM` from `jr3_pci_auto_attach()` as soon
    as one of the calls to `jr3_pci_alloc_spriv()` returns `NULL`.  The
    COMEDI core will subsequently call `jr3_pci_detach()` to clean up.

    KVM: s390: Fix guest migration for huge guests resulting in panic

    While we can technically not run huge page guests right now, we can
    setup a guest with huge pages. Trying to migrate it will trigger a
    VM_BUG_ON and, if the kernel is not configured to panic on a BUG, it
    will happily try to work on non-existing page table entries.
    
    With this patch, we always return "dirty" if we encounter a large page
    when migrating. This at least fixes the immediate problem until we
    have proper handling for both kind of pages.

    scsi: libiscsi: add lock around task lists to fix list corruption regression
    
    [ Upstream commit 6f8830f5bbab16e54f261de187f3df4644a5b977 ]
    
    There's a rather long standing regression from the commit "libiscsi:
    Reduce locking contention in fast path"
    
    Depending on iSCSI target behavior, it's possible to hit the case in
    iscsi_complete_task where the task is still on a pending list
    (!list_empty(&task->running)).  When that happens the task is removed
    from the list while holding the session back_lock, but other task list
    modification occur under the frwd_lock.  That leads to linked list
    corruption and eventually a panicked system.
    
    Rather than back out the session lock split entirely, in order to try
    and keep some of the performance gains this patch adds another lock to
    maintain the task lists integrity.
    
    Major enterprise supported kernels have been backing out the lock split
    for while now, thanks to the efforts at IBM where a lab setup has the
    most reliable reproducer I've seen on this issue.  This patch has been
    tested there successfully.

    ALSA: seq: Fix link corruption by event error handling
    
    [ Upstream commit f3ac9f737603da80c2da3e84b89e74429836bb6d ]
    
    The sequencer FIFO management has a bug that may lead to a corruption
    (shortage) of the cell linked list.  When a sequencer client faces an
    error at the event delivery, it tries to put back the dequeued cell.
    When the first queue was put back, this forgot the tail pointer
    tracking, and the link will be screwed up.
    
    Although there is no memory corruption, the sequencer client may stall
    forever at exit while flushing the pending FIFO cells in
    snd_seq_pool_done(), as spotted by syzkaller.
    
    This patch addresses the missing tail pointer tracking at
    snd_seq_fifo_cell_putback().  Also the patch makes sure to clear the
    cell->enxt pointer at snd_seq_fifo_event_in() for avoiding a similar
    mess-up of the FIFO linked list.

    [ Upstream commit 71321eb3f2d0df4e6c327e0b936eec4458a12054 ]
    
    When a user sets a too small ticks with a fine-grained timer like
    hrtimer, the kernel tries to fire up the timer irq too frequently.
    This may lead to the condensed locks, eventually the kernel spinlock
    lockup with warnings.
    
    For avoiding such a situation, we define a lower limit of the
    resolution, namely 1ms.  When the user passes a too small tick value
    that results in less than that, the kernel returns -EINVAL now.

    ipc/shm: Fix shmat mmap nil-page protection
    
    [ Upstream commit 95e91b831f87ac8e1f8ed50c14d709089b4e01b8 ]
    
    The issue is described here, with a nice testcase:
    
        https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=192931
    
    The problem is that shmat() calls do_mmap_pgoff() with MAP_FIXED, and
    the address rounded down to 0.  For the regular mmap case, the
    protection mentioned above is that the kernel gets to generate the
    address -- arch_get_unmapped_area() will always check for MAP_FIXED and
    return that address.  So by the time we do security_mmap_addr(0) things
    get funky for shmat().
    
    The testcase itself shows that while a regular user crashes, root will
    not have a problem attaching a nil-page.  There are two possible fixes
    to this.  The first, and which this patch does, is to simply allow root
    to crash as well -- this is also regular mmap behavior, ie when hacking
    up the testcase and adding mmap(...  |MAP_FIXED).  While this approach
    is the safer option, the second alternative is to ignore SHM_RND if the
    rounded address is 0, thus only having MAP_SHARED flags.  This makes the
    behavior of shmat() identical to the mmap() case.  The downside of this
    is obviously user visible, but does make sense in that it maintains
    semantics after the round-down wrt 0 address and mmap.
    
    Passes shm related ltp tests.

    can corrupt one of field from anon_vma under us and system goes panic

    mmap_sem lockdep, sometime other places where places never related to
    zram/zsmalloc, and not reproducible with some configuration.
    
    When I consider how that bug is subtle and people do fast-swap test with
    brd, it's worth to add stable mark, I think.

    mm: vmpressure: fix sending wrong events on underflow
    
    [ Upstream commit e1587a4945408faa58d0485002c110eb2454740c ]
    
    At the end of a window period, if the reclaimed pages is greater than
    scanned, an unsigned underflow can result in a huge pressure value and
    thus a critical event.  Reclaimed pages is found to go higher than
    scanned because of the addition of reclaimed slab pages to reclaimed in
    shrink_node without a corresponding increment to scanned pages.
    
    Minchan Kim mentioned that this can also happen in the case of a THP
    page where the scanned is 1 and reclaimed could be 512.

    mm/page_alloc: fix nodes for reclaim in fast path
    
    [ Upstream commit e02dc017c3032dcdce1b993af0db135462e1b4b7 ]
    
    When @node_reclaim_node isn't 0, the page allocator tries to reclaim
    pages if the amount of free memory in the zones are below the low
    watermark.  On Power platform, none of NUMA nodes are scanned for page
    reclaim because no nodes match the condition in zone_allows_reclaim().
    On Power platform, RECLAIM_DISTANCE is set to 10 which is the distance
    of Node-A to Node-A.  So the preferred node even won't be scanned for
    page reclaim.
    
       __alloc_pages_nodemask()
       get_page_from_freelist()
          zone_allows_reclaim()
    
    Anton proposed the test code as below:
    
       # cat alloc.c
          :
       int main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
            void *p;
            unsigned long size;
            unsigned long start, end;
    
            start = time(NULL);
            size = strtoul(argv[1], NULL, 0);
            printf("To allocate %ldGB memory\n", size);
    
            size <<= 30;
            p = malloc(size);
            assert(p);
            memset(p, 0, size);
    
            end = time(NULL);
            printf("Used time: %ld seconds\n", end - start);
            sleep(3600);
            return 0;
       }
    
    The system I use for testing has two NUMA nodes.  Both have 128GB
    memory.  In below scnario, the page caches on node#0 should be reclaimed
    when it encounters pressure to accommodate request of allocation.
    
       # echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode; \
         sync; \
         echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; \
       # taskset -c 0 cat file.32G > /dev/null; \
         grep FilePages /sys/devices/system/node/node0/meminfo
         Node 0 FilePages:       33619712 kB
       # taskset -c 0 ./alloc 128
       # grep FilePages /sys/devices/system/node/node0/meminfo
         Node 0 FilePages:       33619840 kB
       # grep MemFree /sys/devices/system/node/node0/meminfo
         Node 0 MemFree:          186816 kB
    
    With the patch applied, the pagecache on node-0 is reclaimed when its
    free memory is running out.  It's the expected behaviour.
    
       # echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode; \
         sync; \
         echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
       # taskset -c 0 cat file.32G > /dev/null; \
         grep FilePages /sys/devices/system/node/node0/meminfo
         Node 0 FilePages:       33605568 kB
       # taskset -c 0 ./alloc 128
       # grep FilePages /sys/devices/system/node/node0/meminfo
         Node 0 FilePages:        1379520 kB
       # grep MemFree /sys/devices/system/node/node0/meminfo
         Node 0 MemFree:           317120 kB

    MIPS: OCTEON: Fix copy_from_user fault handling for large buffers
    
    [ Upstream commit 884b426917e4b3c85f33b382c792a94305dfdd62 ]
    
    If copy_from_user is called with a large buffer (>= 128 bytes) and the
    userspace buffer refers partially to unreadable memory, then it is
    possible for Octeon's copy_from_user to report the wrong number of bytes
    have been copied. In the case where the buffer size is an exact multiple
    of 128 and the fault occurs in the last 64 bytes, copy_from_user will
    report that all the bytes were copied successfully but leave some
    garbage in the destination buffer.
    
    The bug is in the main __copy_user_common loop in octeon-memcpy.S where
    in the middle of the loop, src and dst are incremented by 128 bytes. The
    l_exc_copy fault handler is used after this but that assumes that
    "src < THREAD_BUADDR($28)". This is not the case if src has already been
    incremented.
    
    Fix by adding an extra fault handler which rewinds the src and dst
    pointers 128 bytes before falling though to l_exc_copy.
    
    Thanks to the pwritev test from the strace test suite for originally
    highlighting this bug!

    ALSA: hda - fix Lewisburg audio issue
    
    [ Upstream commit e7480b34ad1ab84a63540b2c884cb92c0764ab74 ]
    
    Like for Sunrise Point, the total stream number of Lewisburg's
    input and output stream exceeds 15 (GCAP is 0x9701), which will
    cause some streams do not work because of the overflow on
    SDxCTL.STRM field if using the legacy stream tag allocation method.

    goldfish: Sanitize the broken interrupt handler
    
    [ Upstream commit 6cf18e6927c0b224f972e3042fb85770d63cb9f8 ]
    
    This interrupt handler is broken in several ways:
    
      - It loops forever when the op code is not decodeable
    
      - It never returns IRQ_HANDLED because the only way to exit the loop
        returns IRQ_NONE unconditionally.
    
    The whole concept of this is broken. Creating devices in an interrupt
    handler is beyond any point of sanity.
    
    Make it at least behave halfways sane so accidental users do not have to
    deal with a hard to debug lockup.

    x86/platform/goldfish: Prevent unconditional loading
    
    [ Upstream commit 47512cfd0d7a8bd6ab71d01cd89fca19eb2093eb ]
    
    The goldfish platform code registers the platform device unconditionally
    which causes havoc in several ways if the goldfish_pdev_bus driver is
    enabled:
    
     - Access to the hardcoded physical memory region, which is either not
       available or contains stuff which is completely unrelated.
    
     - Prevents that the interrupt of the serial port can be requested
    
     - In case of a spurious interrupt it goes into a infinite loop in the
       interrupt handler of the pdev_bus driver (which needs to be fixed
       seperately).
    
    Add a 'goldfish' command line option to make the registration opt-in when
    the platform is compiled in.
    
    I'm seriously grumpy about this engineering trainwreck, which has seven
    SOBs from Intel developers for 50 lines of code. And none of them figured
    out that this is broken. Impressive fail!

    ath9k: use correct OTP register offsets for the AR9340 and AR9550
    
    [ Upstream commit c9f1e32600816d695f817477d56490bfc2ba43c6 ]
    
    This patch fixes the OTP register definitions for the AR934x and AR9550
    WMAC SoC.
    
    Previously, the ath9k driver was unable to initialize the integrated
    WMAC on an Aerohive AP121:
    
    | ath: phy0: timeout (1000 us) on reg 0x30018: 0xbadc0ffe & 0x00000007 != 0x00000004
    | ath: phy0: timeout (1000 us) on reg 0x30018: 0xbadc0ffe & 0x00000007 != 0x00000004
    | ath: phy0: Unable to initialize hardware; initialization status: -5
    | ath9k ar934x_wmac: failed to initialize device
    | ath9k: probe of ar934x_wmac failed with error -5
    
    It turns out that the AR9300_OTP_STATUS and AR9300_OTP_DATA
    definitions contain a typo.

    powerpc/xmon: Fix data-breakpoint
    
    [ Upstream commit c21a493a2b44650707d06741601894329486f2ad ]
    
    Currently xmon data-breakpoint feature is broken.
    
    Whenever there is a watchpoint match occurs, hw_breakpoint_handler will
    be called by do_break via notifier chains mechanism. If watchpoint is
    registered by xmon, hw_breakpoint_handler won't find any associated
    perf_event and returns immediately with NOTIFY_STOP. Similarly, do_break
    also returns without notifying to xmon.
    
    Solve this by returning NOTIFY_DONE when hw_breakpoint_handler does not
    find any perf_event associated with matched watchpoint, rather than
    NOTIFY_STOP, which tells the core code to continue calling the other
    breakpoint handlers including the xmon one.

    ath9k: fix race condition in enabling/disabling IRQs
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a5e969bb2f6692a256352649355d56d018d6b88 ]
    
    The code currently relies on refcounting to disable IRQs from within the
    IRQ handler and re-enabling them again after the tasklet has run.
    
    However, due to race conditions sometimes the IRQ handler might be
    called twice, or the tasklet may not run at all (if interrupted in the
    middle of a reset).
    
    This can cause nasty imbalances in the irq-disable refcount which will
    get the driver permanently stuck until the entire radio has been stopped
    and started again (ath_reset will not recover from this).
    
    Instead of using this fragile logic, change the code to ensure that
    running the irq handler during tasklet processing is safe, and leave the
    refcount untouched.

    USB: serial: ftdi_sio: fix line-status over-reporting
    
    [ Upstream commit a6bb1e17a39818b01b55d8e6238b4b5f06d55038 ]
    
    FTDI devices use a receive latency timer to periodically empty the
    receive buffer and report modem and line status (also when the buffer is
    empty).
    
    When a break or error condition is detected the corresponding status
    flags will be set on a packet with nonzero data payload and the flags
    are not updated until the break is over or further characters are
    received.
    
    In order to avoid over-reporting break and error conditions, these flags
    must therefore only be processed for packets with payload.
    
    This specifically fixes the case where after an overrun, the error
    condition is continuously reported and NULL-characters inserted until
    further data is received.

    serial: 8250_pci: Add MKS Tenta SCOM-0800 and SCOM-0801 cards
    
    [ Upstream commit 1c9c858e2ff8ae8024a3d75d2ed080063af43754 ]
    
    The MKS Instruments SCOM-0800 and SCOM-0801 cards (originally by Tenta
    Technologies) are 3U CompactPCI serial cards with 4 and 8 serial ports,
    respectively.  The first 4 ports are implemented by an OX16PCI954 chip,
    and the second 4 ports are implemented by an OX16C954 chip on a local

    If the journal has been aborted, we shouldn't mark the underlying
    buffer head as dirty, since that will cause the metadata block to get
    modified.  And if the journal has been aborted, we shouldn't allow
    this since it will almost certainly lead to a corrupted file system.

    s390/qdio: clear DSCI prior to scanning multiple input queues
    
    [ Upstream commit 1e4a382fdc0ba8d1a85b758c0811de3a3631085e ]
    
    For devices with multiple input queues, tiqdio_call_inq_handlers()
    iterates over all input queues and clears the device's DSCI
    during each iteration. If the DSCI is re-armed during one
    of the later iterations, we therefore do not scan the previous
    queues again.
    The re-arming also raises a new adapter interrupt. But its
    handler does not trigger a rescan for the device, as the DSCI
    has already been erroneously cleared.
    This can result in queue stalls on devices with multiple
    input queues.
    
    Fix it by clearing the DSCI just once, prior to scanning the queues.
    
    As the code is moved in front of the loop, we also need to access
    the DSCI directly (ie irq->dsci) instead of going via each queue's
    parent pointer to the same irq. This is not a functional change,
    and a follow-up patch will clean up the other users.
    
    In practice, this bug only affects CQ-enabled HiperSockets devices,
    ie. devices with sysfs-attribute "hsuid" set. Setting a hsuid is
    needed for AF_IUCV socket applications that use HiperSockets
    communication.

    mnt: Tuck mounts under others instead of creating shadow/side mounts.
    
    [ Upstream commit 1064f874abc0d05eeed8993815f584d847b72486 ]
    
    Ever since mount propagation was introduced in cases where a mount in
    propagated to parent mount mountpoint pair that is already in use the
    code has placed the new mount behind the old mount in the mount hash
    table.
    
    This implementation detail is problematic as it allows creating
    arbitrary length mount hash chains.
    
    Furthermore it invalidates the constraint maintained elsewhere in the
    mount code that a parent mount and a mountpoint pair will have exactly
    one mount upon them.  Making it hard to deal with and to talk about
    this special case in the mount code.
    
    Modify mount propagation to notice when there is already a mount at
    the parent mount and mountpoint where a new mount is propagating to
    and place that preexisting mount on top of the new mount.
    
    Modify unmount propagation to notice when a mount that is being
    unmounted has another mount on top of it (and no other children), and
    to replace the unmounted mount with the mount on top of it.
    
    Move the MNT_UMUONT test from __lookup_mnt_last into
    __propagate_umount as that is the only call of __lookup_mnt_last where
    MNT_UMOUNT may be set on any mount visible in the mount hash table.
    
    These modifications allow:
     - __lookup_mnt_last to be removed.
     - attach_shadows to be renamed __attach_mnt and its shadow
       handling to be removed.
     - commit_tree to be simplified
     - copy_tree to be simplified
    
    The result is an easier to understand tree of mounts that does not
    allow creation of arbitrary length hash chains in the mount hash table.
    
    The result is also a very slight userspace visible difference in semantics.
    The following two cases now behave identically, where before order
    mattered:
    
    case 1: (explicit user action)
            B is a slave of A
            mount something on A/a , it will propagate to B/a
            and than mount something on B/a
    
    case 2: (tucked mount)
            B is a slave of A
            mount something on B/a
            and than mount something on A/a
    
    Histroically umount A/a would fail in case 1 and succeed in case 2.
    Now umount A/a succeeds in both configurations.
    
    This very small change in semantics appears if anything to be a bug
    fix to me and my survey of userspace leads me to believe that no programs
    will notice or care of this subtle semantic change.
    
    v2: Updated to mnt_change_mountpoint to not call dput or mntput
    and instead to decrement the counts directly.  It is guaranteed
    that there will be other references when mnt_change_mountpoint is
    called so this is safe.
    
    v3: Moved put_mountpoint under mount_lock in attach_recursive_mnt
        As the locking in fs/namespace.c changed between v2 and v3.
    
    v4: Reworked the logic in propagate_mount_busy and __propagate_umount
        that detects when a mount completely covers another mount.
    
    v5: Removed unnecessary tests whose result is alwasy true in
        find_topper and attach_recursive_mnt.
    
    v6: Document the user space visible semantic difference.

    [ Upstream commit fb61bb82cb46a932ef2fc62e1c731c8e7e6640d5 ]
    
    The RTC is clocked from either an internal, imprecise, oscillator or an
    external one, which is usually much more accurate.
    
    The difference perceived between the time elapsed and the time reported by
    the RTC is in a 10% scale, which prevents the RTC from being useful at all.
    
    Fortunately, the external oscillator is reported to be mandatory in the
    Allwinner datasheet, so we can just switch to it.

    arm/arm64: KVM: Enforce unconditional flush to PoC when mapping to stage-2
    
    [ Upstream commit 8f36ebaf21fdae99c091c67e8b6fab33969f2667 ]
    
    When we fault in a page, we flush it to the PoC (Point of Coherency)
    if the faulting vcpu has its own caches off, so that it can observe
    the page we just brought it.
    
    But if the vcpu has its caches on, we skip that step. Bad things
    happen when *another* vcpu tries to access that page with its own
    caches disabled. At that point, there is no garantee that the
    data has made it to the PoC, and we access stale data.
    
    The obvious fix is to always flush to PoC when a page is faulted
    in, no matter what the state of the vcpu is.

    USB: serial: ftdi_sio: fix extreme low-latency setting
    
    [ Upstream commit c6dce2626606ef16434802989466636bc28c1419 ]
    
    Since commit 557aaa7ffab6 ("ft232: support the ASYNC_LOW_LATENCY
    flag") the FTDI driver has been using a receive latency-timer value of
    1 ms instead of the device default of 16 ms.
    
    The latency timer is used to periodically empty a non-full receive
    buffer, but a status header is always sent when the timer expires
    including when the buffer is empty. This means that a two-byte bulk
    message is received every millisecond also for an otherwise idle port as
    long as it is open.
    
    Let's restore the pre-2009 behaviour which reduces the rate of the
    status messages to 1/16th (e.g. interrupt frequency drops from 1 kHz to
    62.5 Hz) by not setting ASYNC_LOW_LATENCY by default.
    
    Anyone willing to pay the price for the minimum-latency behaviour should
    set the flag explicitly instead using the TIOCSSERIAL ioctl or a tool
    such as setserial (e.g. setserial /dev/ttyUSB0 low_latency).
    
    Note that since commit 0cbd81a9f6ba ("USB: ftdi_sio: remove
    tty->low_latency") the ASYNC_LOW_LATENCY flag has no other effects but
    to set a minimal latency timer.

    w1: ds2490: USB transfer buffers need to be DMAable
    
    [ Upstream commit 61cd1b4cd1e8f7f7642ab64529d9bd52e8374641 ]
    
    ds2490 driver was doing USB transfers from / to buffers on a stack.
    This is not permitted and made the driver non-working with vmapped stacks.
    
    Since all these transfers are done under the same bus_mutex lock we can
    simply use shared buffers in a device private structure for two most common
    of them.
    
    While we are at it, let's also fix a comparison between int and size_t in
    ds9490r_search() which made the driver spin in this function if state
    register get requests were failing.

    staging: rtl: fix possible NULL pointer dereference
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e017006022abfea5d2466cad936065f45763ad1 ]
    
    gcc-7 detects that wlanhdr_to_ethhdr() in two drivers calls memcpy() with
    a destination argument that an earlier function call may have set to NULL:
    
    staging/rtl8188eu/core/rtw_recv.c: In function 'wlanhdr_to_ethhdr':
    staging/rtl8188eu/core/rtw_recv.c:1318:2: warning: argument 1 null where non-null expected [-Wnonnull]
    staging/rtl8712/rtl871x_recv.c: In function 'r8712_wlanhdr_to_ethhdr':
    staging/rtl8712/rtl871x_recv.c:649:2: warning: argument 1 null where non-null expected [-Wnonnull]
    
    I'm fixing this by adding a NULL pointer check and returning failure
    from the function, which is hopefully already handled properly.
    
    This seems to date back to when the drivers were originally added,
    so backporting the fix to stable seems appropriate. There are other
    related realtek drivers in the kernel, but none of them contain a
    function with a similar name or produce this warning.

    [ Upstream commit 2eee05020a0e7ee7c04422cbacdb07859e45dce6 ]
    
    The opticon driver used a control request at open to trigger a CTS
    status notification to be sent over the bulk-in pipe. When the driver
    was converted to using the generic read implementation, an inverted test
    prevented this request from being sent, something which could lead to
    TIOCMGET reporting an incorrect CTS state.

    IB/ipoib: Fix deadlock between rmmod and set_mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 0a0007f28304cb9fc87809c86abb80ec71317f20 ]
    
    When calling set_mode from sys/fs, the call flow locks the sys/fs lock
    first and then tries to lock rtnl_lock (when calling ipoib_set_mod).
    On the other hand, the rmmod call flow takes the rtnl_lock first
    (when calling unregister_netdev) and then tries to take the sys/fs
    lock. Deadlock a->b, b->a.
    
    The problem starts when ipoib_set_mod frees it's rtnl_lck and tries
    to get it after that.

    RDMA/core: Fix incorrect structure packing for booleans
    
    [ Upstream commit 55efcfcd7776165b294f8b5cd6e05ca00ec89b7c ]
    
    The RDMA core uses ib_pack() to convert from unpacked CPU structs
    to on-the-wire bitpacked structs.
    
    This process requires that 1 bit fields are declared as u8 in the
    unpacked struct, otherwise the packing process does not read the
    value properly and the packed result is wired to 0. Several
    places wrongly used int.
    
    Crucially this means the kernel has never, set reversible
    correctly in the path record request. It has always asked for
    irreversible paths even if the ULP requests otherwise.
    
    When the kernel is used with a SM that supports this feature, it
    completely breaks communication management if reversible paths are
    not properly requested.
    
    The only reason this ever worked is because opensm ignores the
    reversible bit.

    [ Upstream commit bb9bc4689b9c635714fbcd5d335bad9934a7ebfc ]
    
    get_frame_info() calculates the offset of the return address within a
    stack frame simply by dividing a the bottom 16 bits of the instruction,
    treated as a signed integer, by the size of a long. Whilst this works
    for MIPS32 & MIPS64 ISAs where the sw or sd instructions are used, it's
    incorrect for microMIPS where encodings differ. The result is that we
    typically completely fail to unwind the stack on microMIPS.
    
    Fix this by adjusting is_ra_save_ins() to calculate the return address
    offset, and take into account the various different encodings there in
    the same place as we consider whether an instruction is storing the
    ra/$31 register.
    
    With this we are now able to unwind the stack for kernels targetting the
    microMIPS ISA, for example we can produce:

    MIPS: Fix is_jump_ins() handling of 16b microMIPS instructions
    
    [ Upstream commit 67c75057709a6d85c681c78b9b2f9b71191f01a2 ]
    
    is_jump_ins() checks 16b instruction fields without verifying that the
    instruction is indeed 16b, as is done by is_ra_save_ins() &
    is_sp_move_ins(). Add the appropriate check.

    MIPS: Fix get_frame_info() handling of microMIPS function size
    
    [ Upstream commit b6c7a324df37bf05ef7a2c1580683cf10d082d97 ]
    
    get_frame_info() is meant to iterate over up to the first 128
    instructions within a function, but for microMIPS kernels it will not
    reach that many instructions unless the function is 512 bytes long since
    we calculate the maximum number of instructions to check by dividing the
    function length by the 4 byte size of a union mips_instruction. In
    microMIPS kernels this won't do since instructions are variable length.
    
    Fix this by instead checking whether the pointer to the current
    instruction has reached the end of the function, and use max_insns as a
    simple constant to check the number of iterations against.

    MIPS: Prevent unaligned accesses during stack unwinding
    
    [ Upstream commit a3552dace7d1d0cabf573e88fc3025cb90c4a601 ]
    
    During stack unwinding we call a number of functions to determine what
    type of instruction we're looking at. The union mips_instruction pointer
    provided to them may be pointing at a 2 byte, but not 4 byte, aligned
    address & we thus cannot directly access the 4 byte wide members of the
    union mips_instruction. To avoid this is_ra_save_ins() copies the
    required half-words of the microMIPS instruction to a correctly aligned
    union mips_instruction on the stack, which it can then access safely.
    The is_jump_ins() & is_sp_move_ins() functions do not correctly perform
    this temporary copy, and instead attempt to directly dereference 4 byte
    fields which may be misaligned and lead to an address exception.
    
    Fix this by copying the instruction halfwords to a temporary union
    mips_instruction in get_frame_info() such that we can provide a 4 byte
    aligned union mips_instruction to the is_*_ins() functions and they do
    not need to deal with misalignment themselves.

    MIPS: Clear ISA bit correctly in get_frame_info()
    
    [ Upstream commit ccaf7caf2c73c6db920772bf08bf1d47b2170634 ]
    
    get_frame_info() can be called in microMIPS kernels with the ISA bit
    already clear. For example this happens when unwind_stack_by_address()
    is called because we begin with a PC that has the ISA bit set & subtract
    the (odd) offset from the preceding symbol (which does not have the ISA
    bit set). Since get_frame_info() unconditionally subtracts 1 from the PC
    in microMIPS kernels it incorrectly misaligns the address it then
    attempts to access code at, leading to an address error exception.
    
    Fix this by using msk_isa16_mode() to clear the ISA bit, which allows
    get_frame_info() to function regardless of whether it is provided with a
    PC that has the ISA bit set or not.

    drm/i915/dsi: Do not clear DPOUNIT_CLOCK_GATE_DISABLE from vlv_init_display_clock_gating
    
    [ Upstream commit 721d484563e1a51ada760089c490cbc47e909756 ]
    
    On my Cherrytrail CUBE iwork8 Air tablet PIPE-A would get stuck on loading
    i915 at boot 1 out of every 3 boots, resulting in a non functional LCD.
    Once the i915 driver has successfully loaded, the panel can be disabled /
    enabled without hitting this issue.
    
    The getting stuck is caused by vlv_init_display_clock_gating() clearing
    the DPOUNIT_CLOCK_GATE_DISABLE bit in DSPCLK_GATE_D when called from
    chv_pipe_power_well_ops.enable() on driver load, while a pipe is enabled
    driving the DSI LCD by the BIOS.
    
    Clearing this bit while DSI is in use is a known issue and
    intel_dsi_pre_enable() / intel_dsi_post_disable() already set / clear it
    as appropriate.
    
    This commit modifies vlv_init_display_clock_gating() to leave the
    DPOUNIT_CLOCK_GATE_DISABLE bit alone fixing the pipe getting stuck.
    
    Changes in v2:
    -Replace PIPE-A with "a pipe" or "the pipe" in the commit msg and
    comment
