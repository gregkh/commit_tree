    powerpc/booke64: set RI in default MSR
    
    commit 5266e58d6cd90ac85c187d673093ad9cb649e16d upstream.
    
    Set RI in the default kernel's MSR so that the architected way of
    detecting unrecoverable machine check interrupts has a chance to work.
    This is inline with the MSR setup of the rest of booke powerpc
    architectures configured here.

    powerpc/lib: fix book3s/32 boot failure due to code patching
    
    commit b45ba4a51cde29b2939365ef0c07ad34c8321789 upstream.
    
    Commit 51c3c62b58b3 ("powerpc: Avoid code patching freed init
    sections") accesses 'init_mem_is_free' flag too early, before the
    kernel is relocated. This provokes early boot failure (before the
    console is active).
    
    As it is not necessary to do this verification that early, this
    patch moves the test into patch_instruction() instead of
    __patch_instruction().
    
    This modification also has the advantage of avoiding unnecessary
    remappings.

    drivers/virt/fsl_hypervisor.c: prevent integer overflow in ioctl
    
    commit 6a024330650e24556b8a18cc654ad00cfecf6c6c upstream.
    
    The "param.count" value is a u64 thatcomes from the user.  The code
    later in the function assumes that param.count is at least one and if
    it's not then it leads to an Oops when we dereference the ZERO_SIZE_PTR.
    
    Also the addition can have an integer overflow which would lead us to
    allocate a smaller "pages" array than required.  I can't immediately
    tell what the possible run times implications are, but it's safest to
    prevent the overflow.

    bonding: fix arp_validate toggling in active-backup mode
    
    [ Upstream commit a9b8a2b39ce65df45687cf9ef648885c2a99fe75 ]
    
    There's currently a problem with toggling arp_validate on and off with an
    active-backup bond. At the moment, you can start up a bond, like so:
    
    modprobe bonding mode=1 arp_interval=100 arp_validate=0 arp_ip_targets=192.168.1.1
    ip link set bond0 down
    echo "ens4f0" > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
    echo "ens4f1" > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
    ip link set bond0 up
    ip addr add 192.168.1.2/24 dev bond0
    
    Pings to 192.168.1.1 work just fine. Now turn on arp_validate:
    
    echo 1 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/arp_validate
    
    Pings to 192.168.1.1 continue to work just fine. Now when you go to turn
    arp_validate off again, the link falls flat on it's face:
    
    echo 0 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/arp_validate
    dmesg
    ...
    [133191.911987] bond0: Setting arp_validate to none (0)
    [133194.257793] bond0: bond_should_notify_peers: slave ens4f0
    [133194.258031] bond0: link status definitely down for interface ens4f0, disabling it
    [133194.259000] bond0: making interface ens4f1 the new active one
    [133197.330130] bond0: link status definitely down for interface ens4f1, disabling it
    [133197.331191] bond0: now running without any active interface!
    
    The problem lies in bond_options.c, where passing in arp_validate=0
    results in bond->recv_probe getting set to NULL. This flies directly in
    the face of commit 3fe68df97c7f, which says we need to set recv_probe =
    bond_arp_recv, even if we're not using arp_validate. Said commit fixed
    this in bond_option_arp_interval_set, but missed that we can get to that
    same state in bond_option_arp_validate_set as well.
    
    One solution would be to universally set recv_probe = bond_arp_recv here
    as well, but I don't think bond_option_arp_validate_set has any business
    touching recv_probe at all, and that should be left to the arp_interval
    code, so we can just make things much tidier here.
    
    Fixes: 3fe68df97c7f ("bonding: always set recv_probe to bond_arp_rcv in arp monitor")

    ipv4: Fix raw socket lookup for local traffic
    
    [ Upstream commit 19e4e768064a87b073a4b4c138b55db70e0cfb9f ]
    
    inet_iif should be used for the raw socket lookup. inet_iif considers
    rt_iif which handles the case of local traffic.
    
    As it stands, ping to a local address with the '-I <dev>' option fails
    ever since ping was changed to use SO_BINDTODEVICE instead of
    cmsg + IP_PKTINFO.
    
    IPv6 works fine.

    vrf: sit mtu should not be updated when vrf netdev is the link
    
    [ Upstream commit ff6ab32bd4e073976e4d8797b4d514a172cfe6cb ]
    
    VRF netdev mtu isn't typically set and have an mtu of 65536. When the
    link of a tunnel is set, the tunnel mtu is changed from 1480 to the link
    mtu minus tunnel header. In the case of VRF netdev is the link, then the
    tunnel mtu becomes 65516. So, fix it by not setting the tunnel mtu in
    this case.

    only works with iproute2. For other tools like libnl, NetworkManager,
    it still could add duplicate rules with only NLM_F_CREATE flag, like
    
    [localhost ~ ]# ip rule
    0:      from all lookup local
    32766:  from all lookup main
    32767:  from all lookup default
    100000: from 192.168.7.5 lookup 5
    100000: from 192.168.7.5 lookup 5
    
    As it doesn't make sense to create two duplicate rules, let's just return
    0 if the rule exists.

    bridge: Fix error path for kobject_init_and_add()
    
    [ Upstream commit bdfad5aec1392b93495b77b864d58d7f101dc1c1 ]
    
    Currently error return from kobject_init_and_add() is not followed by a
    call to kobject_put().  This means there is a memory leak.  We currently
    set p to NULL so that kfree() may be called on it as a noop, the code is
    arguably clearer if we move the kfree() up closer to where it is
    called (instead of after goto jump).
    
    Remove a goto label 'err1' and jump to call to kobject_put() in error
    return from kobject_init_and_add() fixing the memory leak.  Re-name goto
    label 'put_back' to 'err1' now that we don't use err1, following current
    nomenclature (err1, err2 ...).  Move call to kfree out of the error
    code at bottom of function up to closer to where memory was allocated.
    Add comment to clarify call to kfree().

    powerpc/64s: Include cpu header
    
    commit 42e2acde1237878462b028f5a27d9cc5bea7502c upstream.
    
    Current powerpc security.c file is defining functions, as
    cpu_show_meltdown(), cpu_show_spectre_v{1,2} and others, that are being
    declared at linux/cpu.h header without including the header file that
    contains these declarations.
    
    This is being reported by sparse, which thinks that these functions are
    static, due to the lack of declaration:
    
            arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:105:9: warning: symbol 'cpu_show_meltdown' was not declared. Should it be static?
            arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:139:9: warning: symbol 'cpu_show_spectre_v1' was not declared. Should it be static?
            arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:161:9: warning: symbol 'cpu_show_spectre_v2' was not declared. Should it be static?
            arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:209:6: warning: symbol 'stf_barrier' was not declared. Should it be static?
            arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:289:9: warning: symbol 'cpu_show_spec_store_bypass' was not declared. Should it be static?
    
    This patch simply includes the proper header (linux/cpu.h) to match
    function definition and declaration.

    x86/vdso: Pass --eh-frame-hdr to the linker
    
    commit cd01544a268ad8ee5b1dfe42c4393f1095f86879 upstream.
    
    Commit
    
      379d98ddf413 ("x86: vdso: Use $LD instead of $CC to link")
    
    accidentally broke unwinding from userspace, because ld would strip the
    .eh_frame sections when linking.
    
    Originally, the compiler would implicitly add --eh-frame-hdr when
    invoking the linker, but when this Makefile was converted from invoking
    ld via the compiler, to invoking it directly (like vmlinux does),
    the flag was missed. (The EH_FRAME section is important for the VDSO
    shared libraries, but not for vmlinux.)
    
    Fix the problem by explicitly specifying --eh-frame-hdr, which restores
    parity with the old method.

    x86: vdso: Use $LD instead of $CC to link
    
    commit 379d98ddf41344273d9718556f761420f4dc80b3 upstream.
    
    The vdso{32,64}.so can fail to link with CC=clang when clang tries to find
    a suitable GCC toolchain to link these libraries with.
    
    /usr/bin/ld: arch/x86/entry/vdso/vclock_gettime.o:
      access beyond end of merged section (782)
    
    This happens because the host environment leaked into the cross compiler
    environment due to the way clang searches for suitable GCC toolchains.
    
    Clang is a retargetable compiler, and each invocation of it must provide
    --target=<something> --gcc-toolchain=<something> to allow it to find the
    correct binutils for cross compilation. These flags had been added to
    KBUILD_CFLAGS, but the vdso code uses CC and not KBUILD_CFLAGS (for various
    reasons) which breaks clang's ability to find the correct linker when cross
    compiling.
    
    Most of the time this goes unnoticed because the host linker is new enough
    to work anyway, or is incompatible and skipped, but this cannot be reliably
    assumed.
    
    This change alters the vdso makefile to just use LD directly, which
    bypasses clang and thus the searching problem. The makefile will just use
    ${CROSS_COMPILE}ld instead, which is always what we want. This matches the
    method used to link vmlinux.
    
    This drops references to DISABLE_LTO; this option doesn't seem to be set
    anywhere, and not knowing what its possible values are, it's not clear how
    to convert it from CC to LD flag.

    Don't jump to compute_result state from check_result state
    
    commit 4f4fd7c5798bbdd5a03a60f6269cf1177fbd11ef upstream.
    
    Changing state from check_state_check_result to
    check_state_compute_result not only is unsafe but also doesn't
    appear to serve a valid purpose.  A raid6 check should only be
    pushing out extra writes if doing repair and a mis-match occurs.
    The stripe dev management will already try and do repair writes
    for failing sectors.
    
    This patch makes the raid6 check_state_check_result handling
    work more like raid5's.  If somehow too many failures for a
    check, just quit the check operation for the stripe.  When any
    checks pass, don't try and use check_state_compute_result for
    a purpose it isn't needed for and is unsafe for.  Just mark the
    stripe as in sync for passing its parity checks and let the
    stripe dev read/write code and the bad blocks list do their
    job handling I/O errors.
    
    Repro steps from Xiao:
    
    These are the steps to reproduce this problem:
    1. redefined OPT_MEDIUM_ERR_ADDR to 12000 in scsi_debug.c
    2. insmod scsi_debug.ko dev_size_mb=11000  max_luns=1 num_tgts=1
    3. mdadm --create /dev/md127 --level=6 --raid-devices=5 /dev/sde1 /dev/sde2 /dev/sde3 /dev/sde5 /dev/sde6
    sde is the disk created by scsi_debug
    4. echo "2" >/sys/module/scsi_debug/parameters/opts
    5. raid-check
    
    It panic:

    ALSA: pcm: remove SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL1_INFO internal command
    
    commit e11f0f90a626f93899687b1cc909ee37dd6c5809 upstream.
    
    Drivers can implement 'struct snd_pcm_ops.ioctl' to handle some requests
    from ALSA PCM core. These requests are internal purpose in kernel land.
    Usually common set of operations are used for it.
    
    SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL1_INFO is one of the requests. According to code comment,
    it has been obsoleted in the old days.
    
    We can see old releases in ftp.alsa-project.org. The command was firstly
    introduced in v0.5.0 release as SND_PCM_IOCTL1_INFO, to allow drivers to
    fill data of 'struct snd_pcm_channel_info' type. In v0.9.0 release,
    this was obsoleted by the other commands for ioctl(2) such as
    SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_CHANNEL_INFO.
    
    This commit removes the long-abandoned command, bye.

    The RMI4 function structure has been released in rmi_register_function
    if error occurs. However, it will be released again in the function
    rmi_create_function, which may result in a double-free bug.

    MIPS: perf: ath79: Fix perfcount IRQ assignment
    
    [ Upstream commit a1e8783db8e0d58891681bc1e6d9ada66eae8e20 ]
    
    Currently it's not possible to use perf on ath79 due to genirq flags
    mismatch happening on static virtual IRQ 13 which is used for
    performance counters hardware IRQ 5.
    
    On TP-Link Archer C7v5:
    
               CPU0
      2:          0      MIPS   2  ath9k

     $ perf top
     genirq: Flags mismatch irq 13. 00014c83 (mips_perf_pmu) vs. 00002003 (keys)
    
    On TP-Link Archer C7v4:
    
             CPU0
      4:          0      MIPS   4  19000000.eth
      5:       7135      MIPS   5  1a000000.eth
      7:      98379      MIPS   7  timer
      8:         30      MISC   3  ttyS0
     12:      90028      INTC   0  ath9k

     $ perf top
     genirq: Flags mismatch irq 13. 00014c80 (mips_perf_pmu) vs. 00000080 (ehci_hcd:usb1)
    
    This problem is happening, because currently statically assigned virtual
    IRQ 13 for performance counters is not claimed during the initialization
    of MIPS PMU during the bootup, so the IRQ subsystem doesn't know, that
    this interrupt isn't available for further use.
    
    So this patch fixes the issue by simply booking hardware IRQ 5 for MIPS PMU.

    [ Upstream commit becf2319f320cae43e20cf179cc51a355a0deb5f ]
    
    When an icmp error such as pkttoobig is received, conntrack checks
    if the "inner" header (header of packet that did not fit link mtu)
    is matches an existing connection, and, if so, sets that packet as
    being related to the conntrack entry it found.
    
    It was recently reported that this "related" setting also works
    if the inner header is from another, different connection (i.e.,
    artificial/forged icmp error).
    
    Add a test, followup patch will add additional "inner dst matches
    outer dst in reverse direction" check before setting related state.

    ARM does not.

    tools lib traceevent: Fix missing equality check for strcmp
    
    [ Upstream commit f32c2877bcb068a718bb70094cd59ccc29d4d082 ]
    
    There was a missing comparison with 0 when checking if type is "s64" or
    "u64". Therefore, the body of the if-statement was entered if "type" was
    "u64" or not "s64", which made the first strcmp() redundant since if
    type is "u64", it's not "s64".
    
    If type is "s64", the body of the if-statement is not entered but since
    the remainder of the function consists of if-statements which will not
    be entered if type is "s64", we will just return "val", which is
    correct, albeit at the cost of a few more calls to strcmp(), i.e., it
    will behave just as if the if-statement was entered.
    
    If type is neither "s64" or "u64", the body of the if-statement will be
    entered incorrectly and "val" returned. This means that any type that is
    checked after "s64" and "u64" is handled the same way as "s64" and
    "u64", i.e., the limiting of "val" to fit in for example "s8" is never
    reached.
    
    This was introduced in the kernel tree when the sources were copied from
    trace-cmd in commit f7d82350e597 ("tools/events: Add files to create
    libtraceevent.a"), and in the trace-cmd repo in 1cdbae6035cei
    ("Implement typecasting in parser") when the function was introduced,
    i.e., it has always behaved the wrong way.

    KVM: x86: avoid misreporting level-triggered irqs as edge-triggered in tracing
    
    [ Upstream commit 7a223e06b1a411cef6c4cd7a9b9a33c8d225b10e ]
    
    In __apic_accept_irq() interface trig_mode is int and actually on some code
    paths it is set above u8:
    
    kvm_apic_set_irq() extracts it from 'struct kvm_lapic_irq' where trig_mode
    is u16. This is done on purpose as e.g. kvm_set_msi_irq() sets it to
    (1 << 15) & e->msi.data
    
    kvm_apic_local_deliver sets it to reg & (1 << 15).
    
    Fix the immediate issue by making 'tm' into u16. We may also want to adjust
    __apic_accept_irq() interface and use proper sizes for vector, level,
    trig_mode but this is not urgent.

    x86/reboot, efi: Use EFI reboot for Acer TravelMate X514-51T
    
    [ Upstream commit 0082517fa4bce073e7cf542633439f26538a14cc ]
    
    Upon reboot, the Acer TravelMate X514-51T laptop appears to complete the
    shutdown process, but then it hangs in BIOS POST with a black screen.
    
    The problem is intermittent - at some points it has appeared related to
    Secure Boot settings or different kernel builds, but ultimately we have
    not been able to identify the exact conditions that trigger the issue to
    come and go.
    
    Besides, the EFI mode cannot be disabled in the BIOS of this model.
    
    However, after extensive testing, we observe that using the EFI reboot
    method reliably avoids the issue in all cases.
    
    So add a boot time quirk to use EFI reboot on such systems.

    s390/3270: fix lockdep false positive on view->lock
    
    [ Upstream commit 5712f3301a12c0c3de9cc423484496b0464f2faf ]
    
    The spinlock in the raw3270_view structure is used by con3270, tty3270
    and fs3270 in different ways. For con3270 the lock can be acquired in
    irq context, for tty3270 and fs3270 the highest context is bh.
    
    Lockdep sees the view->lock as a single class and if the 3270 driver
    is used for the console the following message is generated:
    
    WARNING: inconsistent lock state

    s390/dasd: Fix capacity calculation for large volumes
    
    [ Upstream commit 2cc9637ce825f3a9f51f8f78af7474e9e85bfa5f ]
    
    The DASD driver incorrectly limits the maximum number of blocks of ECKD
    DASD volumes to 32 bit numbers. Volumes with a capacity greater than
    2^32-1 blocks are incorrectly recognized as smaller volumes.
    
    This results in the following volume capacity limits depending on the
    formatted block size:
    
      BLKSIZE  MAX_GB   MAX_CYL
          512    2047   5843492
         1024    4095   8676701
         2048    8191  13634816
         4096   16383  23860929
    
    The same problem occurs when a volume with more than 17895697 cylinders
    is accessed in raw-track-access mode.
    
    Fix this problem by adding an explicit type cast when calculating the
    maximum number of blocks.

    When cancel_delayed_work() returns, the delayed work may still

    USB: serial: fix unthrottle races
    
    commit 3f5edd58d040bfa4b74fb89bc02f0bc6b9cd06ab upstream.
    
    Fix two long-standing bugs which could potentially lead to memory
    corruption or leave the port throttled until it is reopened (on weakly
    ordered systems), respectively, when read-URB completion races with
    unthrottle().
    
    First, the URB must not be marked as free before processing is complete
    to prevent it from being submitted by unthrottle() on another CPU.
    
            CPU 1                           CPU 2
            ================                ================
            complete()                      unthrottle()
              process_urb();
              smp_mb__before_atomic();
              set_bit(i, free);               if (test_and_clear_bit(i, free))
                                                      submit_urb();
    
    Second, the URB must be marked as free before checking the throttled
    flag to prevent unthrottle() on another CPU from failing to observe that
    the URB needs to be submitted if complete() sees that the throttled flag
    is set.
    
            CPU 1                           CPU 2
            ================                ================
            complete()                      unthrottle()
              set_bit(i, free);               throttled = 0;
              smp_mb__after_atomic();         smp_mb();
              if (throttled)                  if (test_and_clear_bit(i, free))
                      return;                         submit_urb();
    
    Note that test_and_clear_bit() only implies barriers when the test is
    successful. To handle the case where the URB is still in use an explicit
    barrier needs to be added to unthrottle() for the second race condition.

    commit 1cbd7a64959d33e7a2a1fa2bf36a62b350a9fcbd upstream.
    
    It seems that the default case should return AE_CTRL_TERMINATE, instead
    of falling through to case ACPI_RESOURCE_TYPE_END_TAG and returning AE_OK;

    bpf: convert htab map to hlist_nulls
    
    commit 4fe8435909fddc97b81472026aa954e06dd192a5 upstream.
    
    when all map elements are pre-allocated one cpu can delete and reuse htab_elem
    while another cpu is still walking the hlist. In such case the lookup may
    miss the element. Convert hlist to hlist_nulls to avoid such scenario.
    When bucket lock is taken there is no need to take such precautions,
    so only convert map_lookup and map_get_next to nulls.
    The race window is extremely small and only reproducible with explicit
    udelay() inside lookup_nulls_elem_raw()
    
    Similar to hlist add hlist_nulls_for_each_entry_safe() and
    hlist_nulls_entry_safe() helpers.

    field should not be overridden too early otherwise we have a tiny race window
