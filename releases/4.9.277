    btrfs: compression: don't try to compress if we don't have enough pages
    
    commit f2165627319ffd33a6217275e5690b1ab5c45763 upstream
    
    The early check if we should attempt compression does not take into
    account the number of input pages. It can happen that there's only one
    page, eg. a tail page after some ranges of the BTRFS_MAX_UNCOMPRESSED
    have been processed, or an isolated page that won't be converted to an
    inline extent.
    
    The single page would be compressed but a later check would drop it
    again because the result size must be at least one block shorter than
    the input. That can never work with just one page.

    iio: accel: bma180: Fix BMA25x bandwidth register values
    
    commit 8090d67421ddab0ae932abab5a60200598bf0bbb upstream
    
    According to the BMA253 datasheet [1] and BMA250 datasheet [2] the
    bandwidth value for BMA25x should be set as 01xxx:
    
      "Settings 00xxx result in a bandwidth of 7.81 Hz; [...]
       It is recommended [...] to use the range from ´01000b´ to ´01111b´
       only in order to be compatible with future products."
    
    However, at the moment the drivers sets bandwidth values from 0 to 6,
    which is not recommended and always results into 7.81 Hz bandwidth
    according to the datasheet.
    
    Fix this by introducing a bw_offset = 8 = 01000b for BMA25x,
    so the additional bit is always set for BMA25x.

    net: bcmgenet: ensure EXT_ENERGY_DET_MASK is clear
    
    commit 5a3c680aa2c12c90c44af383fe6882a39875ab81 upstream.
    
    Setting the EXT_ENERGY_DET_MASK bit allows the port energy detection
    logic of the internal PHY to prevent the system from sleeping. Some
    internal PHYs will report that energy is detected when the network
    interface is closed which can prevent the system from going to sleep
    if WoL is enabled when the interface is brought down.
    
    Since the driver does not support waking the system on this logic,
    this commit clears the bit whenever the internal PHY is powered up
    and the other logic for manipulating the bit is removed since it
    serves no useful function.

    media: ngene: Fix out-of-bounds bug in ngene_command_config_free_buf()
    
    commit 8d4abca95ecc82fc8c41912fa0085281f19cc29f upstream.
    
    Fix an 11-year old bug in ngene_command_config_free_buf() while
    addressing the following warnings caught with -Warray-bounds:
    
    arch/alpha/include/asm/string.h:22:16: warning: '__builtin_memcpy' offset [12, 16] from the object at 'com' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'config' with type 'unsigned char' at offset 10 [-Warray-bounds]
    arch/x86/include/asm/string_32.h:182:25: warning: '__builtin_memcpy' offset [12, 16] from the object at 'com' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'config' with type 'unsigned char' at offset 10 [-Warray-bounds]
    
    The problem is that the original code is trying to copy 6 bytes of
    data into a one-byte size member _config_ of the wrong structue
    FW_CONFIGURE_BUFFERS, in a single call to memcpy(). This causes a
    legitimate compiler warning because memcpy() overruns the length
    of &com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config. It seems that the right
    structure is FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS, instead, because it contains
    6 more members apart from the header _hdr_. Also, the name of
    the function ngene_command_config_free_buf() suggests that the actual
    intention is to ConfigureFreeBuffers, instead of ConfigureBuffers
    (which takes place in the function ngene_command_config_buf(), above).
    
    Fix this by enclosing those 6 members of struct FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS
    into new struct config, and use &com.cmd.ConfigureFreeBuffers.config as
    the destination address, instead of &com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config,
    when calling memcpy().
    
    This also helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable
    -Warray-bounds and get us closer to being able to tighten the
    FORTIFY_SOURCE routines on memcpy().

    tracing: Fix bug in rb_per_cpu_empty() that might cause deadloop.
    
    commit 67f0d6d9883c13174669f88adac4f0ee656cc16a upstream.
    
    The "rb_per_cpu_empty()" misinterpret the condition (as not-empty) when
    "head_page" and "commit_page" of "struct ring_buffer_per_cpu" points to
    the same buffer page, whose "buffer_data_page" is empty and "read" field
    is non-zero.
    
    An error scenario could be constructed as followed (kernel perspective):
    
    1. All pages in the buffer has been accessed by reader(s) so that all of
    them will have non-zero "read" field.
    
    2. Read and clear all buffer pages so that "rb_num_of_entries()" will
    return 0 rendering there's no more data to read. It is also required
    that the "read_page", "commit_page" and "tail_page" points to the same
    page, while "head_page" is the next page of them.
    
    3. Invoke "ring_buffer_lock_reserve()" with large enough "length"
    so that it shot pass the end of current tail buffer page. Now the
    "head_page", "commit_page" and "tail_page" points to the same page.
    
    4. Discard current event with "ring_buffer_discard_commit()", so that
    "head_page", "commit_page" and "tail_page" points to a page whose buffer
    data page is now empty.
    
    When the error scenario has been constructed, "tracing_read_pipe" will
    be trapped inside a deadloop: "trace_empty()" returns 0 since
    "rb_per_cpu_empty()" returns 0 when it hits the CPU containing such
    constructed ring buffer. Then "trace_find_next_entry_inc()" always
    return NULL since "rb_num_of_entries()" reports there's no more entry
    to read. Finally "trace_seq_to_user()" returns "-EBUSY" spanking
    "tracing_read_pipe" back to the start of the "waitagain" loop.
    
    I've also written a proof-of-concept script to construct the scenario
    and trigger the bug automatically, you can use it to trace and validate
    my reasoning above:
    
      https://github.com/aegistudio/RingBufferDetonator.git
    
    Tests has been carried out on linux kernel 5.14-rc2
    (2734d6c1b1a089fb593ef6a23d4b70903526fe0c), my fixed version
    of kernel (for testing whether my update fixes the bug) and
    some older kernels (for range of affected kernels). Test result is
    also attached to the proof-of-concept repository.

    usb: max-3421: Prevent corruption of freed memory
    
    commit b5fdf5c6e6bee35837e160c00ac89327bdad031b upstream.
    
    The MAX-3421 USB driver remembers the state of the USB toggles for a
    device/endpoint. To save SPI writes, this was only done when a new
    device/endpoint was being used. Unfortunately, if the old device was
    removed, this would cause writes to freed memory.
    
    To fix this, a simpler scheme is used. The toggles are read from
    hardware when a URB is completed, and the toggles are always written to
    hardware when any URB transaction is started. This will cause a few more
    SPI transactions, but no causes kernel panics.

    usb: hub: Disable USB 3 device initiated lpm if exit latency is too high
    
    commit 1b7f56fbc7a1b66967b6114d1b5f5a257c3abae6 upstream.
    
    The device initiated link power management U1/U2 states should not be
    enabled in case the system exit latency plus one bus interval (125us) is
    greater than the shortest service interval of any periodic endpoint.
    
    This is the case for both U1 and U2 sytstem exit latencies and link states.
    
    See USB 3.2 section 9.4.9 "Set Feature" for more details
    
    Note, before this patch the host and device initiated U1/U2 lpm states
    were both enabled with lpm. After this patch it's possible to end up with
    only host inititated U1/U2 lpm in case the exit latencies won't allow
    device initiated lpm.
    
    If this case we still want to set the udev->usb3_lpm_ux_enabled flag so
    that sysfs users can see the link may go to U1/U2.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S: Fix H_RTAS rets buffer overflow
    
    commit f62f3c20647ebd5fb6ecb8f0b477b9281c44c10a upstream.
    
    The kvmppc_rtas_hcall() sets the host rtas_args.rets pointer based on
    the rtas_args.nargs that was provided by the guest. That guest nargs
    value is not range checked, so the guest can cause the host rets pointer
    to be pointed outside the args array. The individual rtas function
    handlers check the nargs and nrets values to ensure they are correct,
    but if they are not, the handlers store a -3 (0xfffffffd) failure
    indication in rets[0] which corrupts host memory.
    
    Fix this by testing up front whether the guest supplied nargs and nret
    would exceed the array size, and fail the hcall directly without storing
    a failure indication to rets[0].
    
    Also expand on a comment about why we kill the guest and try not to
    return errors directly if we have a valid rets[0] pointer.

    xhci: Fix lost USB 2 remote wake
    
    commit 72f68bf5c756f5ce1139b31daae2684501383ad5 upstream.
    
    There's a small window where a USB 2 remote wake may be left unhandled
    due to a race between hub thread and xhci port event interrupt handler.
    
    When the resume event is detected in the xhci interrupt handler it kicks
    the hub timer, which should move the port from resume to U0 once resume
    has been signalled for long enough.
    
    To keep the hub "thread" running we set a bus_state->resuming_ports flag.
    This flag makes sure hub timer function kicks itself.
    
    checking this flag was not properly protected by the spinlock. Flag was
    copied to a local variable before lock was taken. The local variable was
    then checked later with spinlock held.
    
    If interrupt is handled right after copying the flag to the local variable
    we end up stopping the hub thread before it can handle the USB 2 resume.

    (hub thread)                            (xhci event handler)
    
    xhci_hub_status_data()
    status = bus_state->resuming_ports;
                                            <Interrupt>
                                            handle_port_status()
                                            spin_lock()
                                            bus_state->resuming_ports = 1
                                            set_flag(HCD_FLAG_POLL_RH)
                                            spin_unlock()
    spin_lock()
    if (!status)
      clear_flag(HCD_FLAG_POLL_RH)
    spin_unlock()
    
    Fix this by taking the lock a bit earlier so that it covers
    the resuming_ports flag copy in the hub thread

    ALSA: sb: Fix potential ABBA deadlock in CSP driver
    
    commit 1c2b9519159b470ef24b2638f4794e86e2952ab7 upstream.
    
    SB16 CSP driver may hit potentially a typical ABBA deadlock in two
    code paths:
    
     In snd_sb_csp_stop():
         spin_lock_irqsave(&p->chip->mixer_lock, flags);
         spin_lock(&p->chip->reg_lock);
    
     In snd_sb_csp_load():
         spin_lock_irqsave(&p->chip->reg_lock, flags);
         spin_lock(&p->chip->mixer_lock);
    
    Also the similar pattern is seen in snd_sb_csp_start().
    
    Although the practical impact is very small (those states aren't
    triggered in the same running state and this happens only on a real
    hardware, decades old ISA sound boards -- which must be very difficult
    to find nowadays), it's a real scenario and has to be fixed.
    
    This patch addresses those deadlocks by splitting the locks in
    snd_sb_csp_start() and snd_sb_csp_stop() for avoiding the nested
    locks.

    s390/ftrace: fix ftrace_update_ftrace_func implementation
    
    commit f8c2602733c953ed7a16e060640b8e96f9d94b9b upstream.
    
    s390 enforces DYNAMIC_FTRACE if FUNCTION_TRACER is selected.
    At the same time implementation of ftrace_caller is not compliant with
    HAVE_DYNAMIC_FTRACE since it doesn't provide implementation of
    ftrace_update_ftrace_func() and calls ftrace_trace_function() directly.
    
    The subtle difference is that during ftrace code patching ftrace
    replaces function tracer via ftrace_update_ftrace_func() and activates
    it back afterwards. Unexpected direct calls to ftrace_trace_function()
    during ftrace code patching leads to nullptr-dereferences when tracing
    is activated for one of functions which are used during code patching.
    Those function currently are:
    copy_from_kernel_nofault()
    copy_from_kernel_nofault_allowed()
    preempt_count_sub() [with debug_defconfig]
    preempt_count_add() [with debug_defconfig]

    proc: Avoid mixing integer types in mem_rw()
    
    [ Upstream commit d238692b4b9f2c36e35af4c6e6f6da36184aeb3e ]
    
    Use size_t when capping the count argument received by mem_rw(). Since
    count is size_t, using min_t(int, ...) can lead to a negative value
    that will later be passed to access_remote_vm(), which can cause
    unexpected behavior.
    
    Since we are capping the value to at maximum PAGE_SIZE, the conversion
    from size_t to int when passing it to access_remote_vm() as "len"
    shouldn't be a problem.

    [ Upstream commit f3a1a937f7b240be623d989c8553a6d01465d04f ]
    
    This reverts commit 0bd860493f81eb2a46173f6f5e44cc38331c8dbd.
    
    While the patch was working as stated,ie preventing the L850-GL LTE modem
    from crashing on some U3 wake-ups due to a race condition between the
    host wake-up and the modem-side wake-up, when using the MBIM interface,
    this would force disabling the USB runtime PM on the device.
    
    The increased power consumption is significant for LTE laptops,
    and given that with decently recent modem firmwares, when the modem hits
    the bug, it automatically recovers (ie it drops from the bus, but
    automatically re-enumerates after less than half a second, rather than being
    stuck until a power cycle as it was doing with ancient firmware), for
    most people, the trade-off now seems in favor of re-enabling it by
    default.
    
    For people with access to the platform code, the bug can also be worked-around
    successfully by changing the USB3 LFPM polling off-time for the XHCI
    controller in the BIOS code.

    A ISCSI_IFACE_PARAM can have the same value as a ISCSI_NET_PARAM so when
    iscsi_iface_attr_is_visible tries to figure out the type by just checking

    param is.

    del_timer() by sk_stop_timer().
    
    Function sk_reset_timer() will increase the refcount of sock if it is
    called on an inactive timer, hence, in case the timer expires, we need to
    decrease the refcount ourselves in the handler, otherwise, the sock
    refcount will be unbalanced and the sock will never be freed.

    s390/bpf: Perform r1 range checking before accessing jit->seen_reg[r1]
    
    [ Upstream commit 91091656252f5d6d8c476e0c92776ce9fae7b445 ]
    
    Currently array jit->seen_reg[r1] is being accessed before the range
    checking of index r1. The range changing on r1 should be performed
    first since it will avoid any potential out-of-range accesses on the
    array seen_reg[] and also it is more optimal to perform checks on r1
    before fetching data from the array. Fix this by swapping the order
    of the checks before the array access.

    spi: mediatek: fix fifo rx mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a70dd2d050331ee4cf5ad9d5c0a32d83ead9a43 ]
    
    In FIFO mode were two problems:
    - RX mode was never handled and
    - in this case the tx_buf pointer was NULL and caused an exception
    
    fix this by handling RX mode in mtk_spi_fifo_transfer

    ipv6: tcp: drop silly ICMPv6 packet too big messages
    
    commit c7bb4b89033b764eb07db4e060548a6311d801ee upstream.
    
    While TCP stack scales reasonably well, there is still one part that
    can be used to DDOS it.
    
    IPv6 Packet too big messages have to lookup/insert a new route,
    and if abused by attackers, can easily put hosts under high stress,
    with many cpus contending on a spinlock while one is stuck in fib6_run_gc()
    
    ip6_protocol_deliver_rcu()
     icmpv6_rcv()
      icmpv6_notify()
       tcp_v6_err()
        tcp_v6_mtu_reduced()
         inet6_csk_update_pmtu()
          ip6_rt_update_pmtu()
           __ip6_rt_update_pmtu()
            ip6_rt_cache_alloc()
             ip6_dst_alloc()
              dst_alloc()
               ip6_dst_gc()
                fib6_run_gc()
                 spin_lock_bh() ...
    
    Some of our servers have been hit by malicious ICMPv6 packets
    trying to _increase_ the MTU/MSS of TCP flows.
    
    We believe these ICMPv6 packets are a result of a bug in one ISP stack,
    since they were blindly sent back for _every_ (small) packet sent to them.
    
    These packets are for one TCP flow:
    09:24:36.266491 IP6 Addr1 > Victim ICMP6, packet too big, mtu 1460, length 1240
    09:24:36.266509 IP6 Addr1 > Victim ICMP6, packet too big, mtu 1460, length 1240
    09:24:36.316688 IP6 Addr1 > Victim ICMP6, packet too big, mtu 1460, length 1240
    09:24:36.316704 IP6 Addr1 > Victim ICMP6, packet too big, mtu 1460, length 1240
    09:24:36.608151 IP6 Addr1 > Victim ICMP6, packet too big, mtu 1460, length 1240
    
    TCP stack can filter some silly requests :
    
    1) MTU below IPV6_MIN_MTU can be filtered early in tcp_v6_err()
    2) tcp_v6_mtu_reduced() can drop requests trying to increase current MSS.
    
    This tests happen before the IPv6 routing stack is entered, thus
    removing the potential contention and route exhaustion.
    
    Note that IPv6 stack was performing these checks, but too late
    (ie : after the route has been added, and after the potential
    garbage collect war)
    
    v2: fix typo caught by Martin, thanks !
    v3: exports tcp_mtu_to_mss(), caught by David, thanks !

    sides happen from err handlers (tcp_v[46]_mtu_reduced)

    net: validate lwtstate->data before returning from skb_tunnel_info()
    
    commit 67a9c94317402b826fc3db32afc8f39336803d97 upstream.
    
    skb_tunnel_info() returns pointer of lwtstate->data as ip_tunnel_info
    type without validation. lwtstate->data can have various types such as
    mpls_iptunnel_encap, etc and these are not compatible.
    So skb_tunnel_info() should validate before returning that pointer.
    
    Splat looks like:

    net: moxa: fix UAF in moxart_mac_probe
    
    commit c78eaeebe855fd93f2e77142ffd0404a54070d84 upstream.
    
    In case of netdev registration failure the code path will
    jump to init_fail label:
    
    init_fail:
            netdev_err(ndev, "init failed\n");
            moxart_mac_free_memory(ndev);
    irq_map_fail:
            free_netdev(ndev);
            return ret;
    
    So, there is no need to call free_netdev() before jumping
    to error handling path, since it can cause UAF or double-free
    bug.

    Make sure that we disable each of the TX and RX queues in the TDMA and
    RDMA control registers. This is a correctness change to be symmetrical
    with the code that enables the TX and RX queues.

    net: bridge: sync fdb to new unicast-filtering ports
    
    commit a019abd8022061b917da767cd1a66ed823724eab upstream.
    
    Since commit 2796d0c648c9 ("bridge: Automatically manage
    port promiscuous mode.")
    bridges with `vlan_filtering 1` and only 1 auto-port don't
    set IFF_PROMISC for unicast-filtering-capable ports.
    
    Normally on port changes `br_manage_promisc` is called to
    update the promisc flags and unicast filters if necessary,
    but it cannot distinguish between *new* ports and ones
    losing their promisc flag, and new ports end up not
    receiving the MAC address list.
    
    Fix this by calling `br_fdb_sync_static` in `br_add_if`
    after the port promisc flags are updated and the unicast
    filter was supposed to have been filled.

    ip6_skb_dst_mtu with return value of signed int which is inconsistent
    with actually returned values. Also 2 users of this function actually
    assign its value to unsigned int variable and only __xfrm6_output
    assigns result of this function to signed variable but actually uses
    as unsigned in further comparisons and calls. Change this function
    to return unsigned int value.

    sched/fair: Fix CFS bandwidth hrtimer expiry type
    
    [ Upstream commit 72d0ad7cb5bad265adb2014dbe46c4ccb11afaba ]
    
    The time remaining until expiry of the refresh_timer can be negative.
    Casting the type to an unsigned 64-bit value will cause integer
    underflow, making the runtime_refresh_within return false instead of
    true. These situations are rare, but they do happen.
    
    This does not cause user-facing issues or errors; other than
    possibly unthrottling cfs_rq's using runtime from the previous period(s),
    making the CFS bandwidth enforcement less strict in those (special)
    situations.

    scsi: aic7xxx: Fix unintentional sign extension issue on left shift of u8
    
    [ Upstream commit 332a9dd1d86f1e7203fc7f0fd7e82f0b304200fe ]
    
    The shifting of the u8 integer returned fom ahc_inb(ahc, port+3) by 24 bits
    to the left will be promoted to a 32 bit signed int and then sign-extended
    to a u64. In the event that the top bit of the u8 is set then all then all
    the upper 32 bits of the u64 end up as also being set because of the
    sign-extension. Fix this by casting the u8 values to a u64 before the 24
    bit left shift.

    rtc: max77686: Do not enforce (incorrect) interrupt trigger type
    
    [ Upstream commit 742b0d7e15c333303daad4856de0764f4bc83601 ]
    
    Interrupt line can be configured on different hardware in different way,
    even inverted.  Therefore driver should not enforce specific trigger
    type - edge falling - but instead rely on Devicetree to configure it.
    
    The Maxim 77686 datasheet describes the interrupt line as active low
    with a requirement of acknowledge from the CPU therefore the edge
    falling is not correct.
    
    The interrupt line is shared between PMIC and RTC driver, so using level
    sensitive interrupt is here especially important to avoid races.  With
    an edge configuration in case if first PMIC signals interrupt followed
    shortly after by the RTC, the interrupt might not be yet cleared/acked
    thus the second one would not be noticed.

    kbuild: mkcompile_h: consider timestamp if KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP is set
    
    [ Upstream commit a979522a1a88556e42a22ce61bccc58e304cb361 ]
    
    To avoid unnecessary recompilations, mkcompile_h does not regenerate
    compile.h if just the timestamp changed.
    Though, if KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP is set, an explicit timestamp for the
    build was requested, in which case we should not ignore it.
    
    If a user follows the documentation for reproducible builds [1] and
    defines KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP as the git commit timestamp, a clean
    build will have the correct timestamp. A subsequent cherry-pick (or
    amend) changes the commit timestamp and if an incremental build is done
    with a different KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP now, that new value is not taken
    into consideration. But it should for reproducibility.
    
    Hence, whenever KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP is explicitly set, do not ignore
    UTS_VERSION when making a decision about whether the regenerated version
    of compile.h should be moved into place.
