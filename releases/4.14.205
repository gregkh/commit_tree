    PM: runtime: Resume the device earlier in __device_release_driver()
    
    commit 9226c504e364158a17a68ff1fe9d67d266922f50 upstream.
    
    Since the device is resumed from runtime-suspend in
    __device_release_driver() anyway, it is better to do that before
    looking for busy managed device links from it to consumers, because
    if there are any, device_links_unbind_consumers() will be called
    and it will cause the consumer devices' drivers to unbind, so the
    consumer devices will be runtime-resumed.  In turn, resuming each
    consumer device will cause the supplier to be resumed and when the
    runtime PM references from the given consumer to it are dropped, it
    may be suspended.  Then, the runtime-resume of the next consumer
    will cause the supplier to resume again and so on.
    
    Update the code accordingly.

    Revert "ARC: entry: fix potential EFA clobber when TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE"
    
    This reverts commit 00fdec98d9881bf5173af09aebd353ab3b9ac729.
    (but only from 5.2 and prior kernels)
    
    The original commit was a preventive fix based on code-review and was
    auto-picked for stable back-port (for better or worse).
    It was OK for v5.3+ kernels, but turned up needing an implicit change
    68e5c6f073bcf70 "(ARC: entry: EV_Trap expects r10 (vs. r9) to have
     exception cause)" merged in v5.3 which itself was not backported.
    So to summarize the stable backport of this patch for v5.2 and prior
    kernels is busted and it won't boot.
    
    The obvious solution is backport 68e5c6f073bcf70 but that is a pain as
    it doesn't revert cleanly and each of affected kernels (so far v4.19,
    v4.14, v4.9, v4.4) needs a slightly different massaged varaint.
    So the easier fix is to simply revert the backport from 5.2 and prior.
    The issue was not a big deal as it would cause strace to sporadically
    not work correctly.
    
    Waldemar Brodkorb first reported this when running ARC uClibc regressions
    on latest stable kernels (with offending backport). Once he bisected it,
    the analysis was trivial, so thx to him for this.

    ARC: stack unwinding: avoid indefinite looping
    
    commit 328d2168ca524d501fc4b133d6be076142bd305c upstream.
    
    Currently stack unwinder is a while(1) loop which relies on the dwarf
    unwinder to signal termination, which in turn relies on dwarf info to do
    so. This in theory could cause an infinite loop if the dwarf info was
    somehow messed up or the register contents were etc.
    
    This fix thus detects the excessive looping and breaks the loop.

    USB: Add NO_LPM quirk for Kingston flash drive
    
    commit afaa2e745a246c5ab95103a65b1ed00101e1bc63 upstream.
    
    In Bugzilla #208257, Julien Humbert reports that a 32-GB Kingston
    flash drive spontaneously disconnects and reconnects, over and over.
    Testing revealed that disabling Link Power Management for the drive
    fixed the problem.
    
    This patch adds a quirk entry for that drive to turn off LPM permanently.

    Mediatek 8250 port supports speed higher than uartclk / 16. If the baud

    Passing NULL as the old termios so uart_get_baud_rate() will use
    uartclk / 16 - 1 as the new baud rate which will be replaced by the
    original baud rate later by tty_termios_encode_baud_rate() in
    mtk8250_set_termios().

    Further there was only one user ever.
    - Android's loadfont, busybox and console-tools only ever use OP_GET
      and OP_SET
    - fbset documentation only mentions the kernel cmdline font: option,
      not anything else.
    - systemd used OP_COPY before release 232 published in Nov 2016
    
    Now unfortunately the crucial report seems to have gone down with
    gmane, and the commit message doesn't say much. But the pull request
    hints at OP_COPY being broken
    
    https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/3651
    
    So in other words, this never worked, and the only project which
    foolishly every tried to use it, realized that rather quickly too.
    
    Instead of trying to fix security issues here on dead code by adding
    missing checks, fix the entire thing by removing the functionality.
    
    Note that systemd code using the OP_COPY function ignored the return
    value, so it doesn't matter what we're doing here really - just in
    case a lone server somewhere happens to be extremely unlucky and
    running an affected old version of systemd. The relevant code from
    font_copy_to_all_vcs() in systemd was:
    
            /* copy font from active VT, where the font was uploaded to */
            cfo.op = KD_FONT_OP_COPY;
            cfo.height = vcs.v_active-1; /* tty1 == index 0 */
            (void) ioctl(vcfd, KDFONTOP, &cfo);
    
    Note this just disables the ioctl, garbage collecting the now unused
    callbacks is left for -next.
    
    v2: Tetsuo found the old mail, which allowed me to find it on another
    archive. Add the link too.

    vsock: use ns_capable_noaudit() on socket create
    
    [ Upstream commit af545bb5ee53f5261db631db2ac4cde54038bdaf ]
    
    During __vsock_create() CAP_NET_ADMIN is used to determine if the
    vsock_sock->trusted should be set to true. This value is used later
    for determing if a remote connection should be allowed to connect
    to a restricted VM. Unfortunately, if the caller doesn't have
    CAP_NET_ADMIN, an audit message such as an selinux denial is
    generated even if the caller does not want a trusted socket.
    
    Logging errors on success is confusing. To avoid this, switch the
    capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) check to the noaudit version.

    scsi: core: Don't start concurrent async scan on same host
    
    [ Upstream commit 831e3405c2a344018a18fcc2665acc5a38c3a707 ]
    
    The current scanning mechanism is supposed to fall back to a synchronous
    host scan if an asynchronous scan is in progress. However, this rule isn't
    strictly respected, scsi_prep_async_scan() doesn't hold scan_mutex when
    checking shost->async_scan. When scsi_scan_host() is called concurrently,
    two async scans on same host can be started and a hang in do_scan_async()
    is observed.
    
    Fixes this issue by checking & setting shost->async_scan atomically with
    shost->scan_mutex.

    blk-cgroup: Pre-allocate tree node on blkg_conf_prep
    
    [ Upstream commit f255c19b3ab46d3cad3b1b2e1036f4c926cb1d0c ]
    
    Similarly to commit 457e490f2b741 ("blkcg: allocate struct blkcg_gq
    outside request queue spinlock"), blkg_create can also trigger
    occasional -ENOMEM failures at the radix insertion because any
    allocation inside blkg_create has to be non-blocking, making it more
    likely to fail.  This causes trouble for userspace tools trying to
    configure io weights who need to deal with this condition.
    
    This patch reduces the occurrence of -ENOMEMs on this path by preloading
    the radix tree element on a GFP_KERNEL context, such that we guarantee
    the later non-blocking insertion won't fail.
    
    A similar solution exists in blkcg_init_queue for the same situation.

    of: Fix reserved-memory overlap detection
    
    [ Upstream commit ca05f33316559a04867295dd49f85aeedbfd6bfd ]
    
    The reserved-memory overlap detection code fails to detect overlaps if
    either of the regions starts at address 0x0.  The code explicitly checks
    for and ignores such regions, apparently in order to ignore dynamically
    allocated regions which have an address of 0x0 at this point.  These
    dynamically allocated regions also have a size of 0x0 at this point, so
    fix this by removing the check and sorting the dynamically allocated
    regions ahead of any static regions at address 0x0.
    
    For example, there are two overlaps in this case but they are not
    currently reported:
    
            foo@0 {
                    reg = <0x0 0x2000>;
            };
    
            bar@0 {
                    reg = <0x0 0x1000>;
            };
    
            baz@1000 {
                    reg = <0x1000 0x1000>;
            };
    
            quux {
                    size = <0x1000>;
            };
    
    but they are after this patch:
    
     OF: reserved mem: OVERLAP DETECTED!
     bar@0 (0x00000000--0x00001000) overlaps with foo@0 (0x00000000--0x00002000)
     OF: reserved mem: OVERLAP DETECTED!
     foo@0 (0x00000000--0x00002000) overlaps with baz@1000 (0x00001000--0x00002000)

    x86/kexec: Use up-to-dated screen_info copy to fill boot params
    
    [ Upstream commit afc18069a2cb7ead5f86623a5f3d4ad6e21f940d ]
    
    kexec_file_load() currently reuses the old boot_params.screen_info,
    but if drivers have change the hardware state, boot_param.screen_info
    could contain invalid info.
    
    For example, the video type might be no longer VGA, or the frame buffer
    address might be changed. If the kexec kernel keeps using the old screen_info,
    kexec'ed kernel may attempt to write to an invalid framebuffer
    memory region.
    
    There are two screen_info instances globally available, boot_params.screen_info
    and screen_info. Later one is a copy, and is updated by drivers.
    
    So let kexec_file_load use the updated copy.

    futex: Handle transient "ownerless" rtmutex state correctly
    
    commit 9f5d1c336a10c0d24e83e40b4c1b9539f7dba627 upstream.
    
    Gratian managed to trigger the BUG_ON(!newowner) in fixup_pi_state_owner().
    This is one possible chain of events leading to this:
    
    Task Prio       Operation
    T1   120        lock(F)
    T2   120        lock(F)   -> blocks (top waiter)
    T3   50 (RT)    lock(F)   -> boosts T1 and blocks (new top waiter)
    XX              timeout/  -> wakes T2
                    signal
    T1   50         unlock(F) -> wakes T3 (rtmutex->owner == NULL, waiter bit is set)
    T2   120        cleanup   -> try_to_take_mutex() fails because T3 is the top waiter
                                 and the lower priority T2 cannot steal the lock.
                              -> fixup_pi_state_owner() sees newowner == NULL -> BUG_ON()
    
    The comment states that this is invalid and rt_mutex_real_owner() must
    return a non NULL owner when the trylock failed, but in case of a queued
    and woken up waiter rt_mutex_real_owner() == NULL is a valid transient
    state. The higher priority waiter has simply not yet managed to take over
    the rtmutex.
    
    The BUG_ON() is therefore wrong and this is just another retry condition in
    fixup_pi_state_owner().
    
    Drop the locks, so that T3 can make progress, and then try the fixup again.
    
    Gratian provided a great analysis, traces and a reproducer. The analysis is
    to the point, but it confused the hell out of that tglx dude who had to
    page in all the futex horrors again. Condensed version is above.

    The nesting count of trace_printk allows for 4 levels of nesting. The
    nesting counter starts at zero and is incremented before being used to
    retrieve the current context's buffer. But the index to the buffer uses the
    nesting counter after it was incremented, and not its original number,
    which in needs to do.

    ftrace: Handle tracing when switching between context
    
    commit 726b3d3f141fba6f841d715fc4d8a4a84f02c02a upstream.
    
    When an interrupt or NMI comes in and switches the context, there's a delay
    from when the preempt_count() shows the update. As the preempt_count() is
    used to detect recursion having each context have its own bit get set when
    tracing starts, and if that bit is already set, it is considered a recursion
    and the function exits. But if this happens in that section where context
    has changed but preempt_count() has not been updated, this will be
    incorrectly flagged as a recursion.
    
    To handle this case, create another bit call TRANSITION and test it if the
    current context bit is already set. Flag the call as a recursion if the
    TRANSITION bit is already set, and if not, set it and continue. The
    TRANSITION bit will be cleared normally on the return of the function that
    set it, or if the current context bit is clear, set it and clear the
    TRANSITION bit to allow for another transition between the current context
    and an even higher one.

    ftrace: Fix recursion check for NMI test
    
    commit ee11b93f95eabdf8198edd4668bf9102e7248270 upstream.
    
    The code that checks recursion will work to only do the recursion check once
    if there's nested checks. The top one will do the check, the other nested
    checks will see recursion was already checked and return zero for its "bit".
    On the return side, nothing will be done if the "bit" is zero.
    
    The problem is that zero is returned for the "good" bit when in NMI context.
    This will set the bit for NMIs making it look like *all* NMI tracing is
    recursing, and prevent tracing of anything in NMI context!
    
    The simple fix is to return "bit + 1" and subtract that bit on the end to
    get the real bit.

    gfs2: Wake up when sd_glock_disposal becomes zero
    
    commit da7d554f7c62d0c17c1ac3cc2586473c2d99f0bd upstream.
    
    Commit fc0e38dae645 ("GFS2: Fix glock deallocation race") fixed a
    sd_glock_disposal accounting bug by adding a missing atomic_dec
    statement, but it failed to wake up sd_glock_wait when that decrement
    causes sd_glock_disposal to reach zero.  As a consequence,
    gfs2_gl_hash_clear can now run into a 10-minute timeout instead of
    being woken up.  Add the missing wakeup.

    mm: always have io_remap_pfn_range() set pgprot_decrypted()
    
    commit f8f6ae5d077a9bdaf5cbf2ac960a5d1a04b47482 upstream.
    
    The purpose of io_remap_pfn_range() is to map IO memory, such as a
    memory mapped IO exposed through a PCI BAR.  IO devices do not
    understand encryption, so this memory must always be decrypted.
    Automatically call pgprot_decrypted() as part of the generic
    implementation.
    
    This fixes a bug where enabling AMD SME causes subsystems, such as RDMA,
    using io_remap_pfn_range() to expose BAR pages to user space to fail.
    The CPU will encrypt access to those BAR pages instead of passing
    unencrypted IO directly to the device.
    
    Places not mapping IO should use remap_pfn_range().

    kthread_worker: prevent queuing delayed work from timer_fn when it is being canceled
    
    commit 6993d0fdbee0eb38bfac350aa016f65ad11ed3b1 upstream.

    blktrace: fix debugfs use after free
    
    commit bad8e64fb19d3a0de5e564d9a7271c31bd684369 upstream.
    
    On commit 6ac93117ab00 ("blktrace: use existing disk debugfs directory")
    merged on v4.12 Omar fixed the original blktrace code for request-based
    drivers (multiqueue). This however left in place a possible crash, if you
    happen to abuse blktrace while racing to remove / add a device.
    
    We used to use asynchronous removal of the request_queue, and with that
    the issue was easier to reproduce. Now that we have reverted to
    synchronous removal of the request_queue, the issue is still possible to
    reproduce, its however just a bit more difficult.
    
    We essentially run two instances of break-blktrace which add/remove
    a loop device, and setup a blktrace and just never tear the blktrace
    down. We do this twice in parallel. This is easily reproduced with the
    script run_0004.sh from break-blktrace [0].
    
    We can end up with two types of panics each reflecting where we
    race, one a failed blktrace setup:

    The common theme here is:
    
    debugfs: Directory 'loop0' with parent 'block' already present
    
    This crash happens because of how blktrace uses the debugfs directory
    where it places its files. Upon init we always create the same directory
    which would be needed by blktrace but we only do this for make_request
    drivers (multiqueue) block drivers. When you race a removal of these
    devices with a blktrace setup you end up in a situation where the
    make_request recursive debugfs removal will sweep away the blktrace
    files and then later blktrace will also try to remove individual
    dentries which are already NULL. The inverse is also possible and hence
    the two types of use after frees.
    
    We don't create the block debugfs directory on init for these types of
    block devices:
    
      * request-based block driver block devices
      * every possible partition
      * scsi-generic
    
    And so, this race should in theory only be possible with make_request
    drivers.
    
    We can fix the UAF by simply re-using the debugfs directory for
    make_request drivers (multiqueue) and only creating the ephemeral
    directory for the other type of block devices. The new clarifications
    on relying on the q->blk_trace_mutex *and* also checking for q->blk_trace
    *prior* to processing a blktrace ensures the debugfs directories are
    only created if no possible directory name clashes are possible.
    
    This goes tested with:
    
      o nvme partitions
      o ISCSI with tgt, and blktracing against scsi-generic with:
        o block
        o tape
        o cdrom
        o media changer
      o blktests
    
    This patch is part of the work which disputes the severity of
    CVE-2019-19770 which shows this issue is not a core debugfs issue, but
    a misuse of debugfs within blktace.

    Commit 978aa0474115 ("sctp: fix some type cast warnings introduced since

    value as 32-bit integer, although the value is stored as 16-bit integer.
    Later this value is passed to the userspace in 16-bit variable, thus the
    user always gets 0 on big-endian platforms. Fix it by reading the __u16
    field of sctp_arg union, as reading err field would produce a sparse
    warning.

    gianfar: Account for Tx PTP timestamp in the skb headroom
    
    [ Upstream commit d6a076d68c6b5d6a5800f3990a513facb7016dea ]
    
    When PTP timestamping is enabled on Tx, the controller
    inserts the Tx timestamp at the beginning of the frame
    buffer, between SFD and the L2 frame header. This means
    that the skb provided by the stack is required to have
    enough headroom otherwise a new skb needs to be created
    by the driver to accommodate the timestamp inserted by h/w.
    Up until now the driver was relying on the second option,
    using skb_realloc_headroom() to create a new skb to accommodate
    PTP frames. Turns out that this method is not reliable, as
    reallocation of skbs for PTP frames along with the required
    overhead (skb_set_owner_w, consume_skb) is causing random
    crashes in subsequent skb_*() calls, when multiple concurrent
    TCP streams are run at the same time on the same device
    (as seen in James' report).
    Note that these crashes don't occur with a single TCP stream,
    nor with multiple concurrent UDP streams, but only when multiple
    TCP streams are run concurrently with the PTP packet flow
    (doing skb reallocation).
    This patch enforces the first method, by requesting enough
    headroom from the stack to accommodate PTP frames, and so avoiding
    skb_realloc_headroom() & co, and the crashes no longer occur.
    There's no reason not to set needed_headroom to a large enough
    value to accommodate PTP frames, so in this regard this patch
    is a fix.

    gianfar: Replace skb_realloc_headroom with skb_cow_head for PTP
    
    [ Upstream commit d145c9031325fed963a887851d9fa42516efd52b ]
    
    When PTP timestamping is enabled on Tx, the controller
    inserts the Tx timestamp at the beginning of the frame
    buffer, between SFD and the L2 frame header.  This means
    that the skb provided by the stack is required to have
    enough headroom otherwise a new skb needs to be created
    by the driver to accommodate the timestamp inserted by h/w.
    Up until now the driver was relying on skb_realloc_headroom()
    to create new skbs to accommodate PTP frames.  Turns out that
    this method is not reliable in this context at least, as
    skb_realloc_headroom() for PTP frames can cause random crashes,
    mostly in subsequent skb_*() calls, when multiple concurrent
    TCP streams are run at the same time with the PTP flow
    on the same device (as seen in James' report).  I also noticed
    that when the system is loaded by sending multiple TCP streams,
    the driver receives cloned skbs in large numbers.
    skb_cow_head() instead proves to be stable in this scenario,
    and not only handles cloned skbs too but it's also more efficient
    and widely used in other drivers.
    The commit introducing skb_realloc_headroom in the driver
    goes back to 2009, commit 93c1285c5d92
    ("gianfar: reallocate skb when headroom is not enough for fcb").
    For practical purposes I'm referencing a newer commit (from 2012)
    that brings the code to its current structure (and fixes the PTP
    case).

    xen/events: don't use chip_data for legacy IRQs
    
    commit 0891fb39ba67bd7ae023ea0d367297ffff010781 upstream.
    
    Since commit c330fb1ddc0a ("XEN uses irqdesc::irq_data_common::handler_data to store a per interrupt XEN data pointer which contains XEN specific information.")
    Xen is using the chip_data pointer for storing IRQ specific data. When
    running as a HVM domain this can result in problems for legacy IRQs, as
    those might use chip_data for their own purposes.
    
    Use a local array for this purpose in case of legacy IRQs, avoiding the
    double use.

    drm/i915: Break up error capture compression loops with cond_resched()
    
    commit 7d5553147613b50149238ac1385c60e5c7cacb34 upstream.
    
    As the error capture will compress user buffers as directed to by the
    user, it can take an arbitrary amount of time and space. Break up the
    compression loops with a call to cond_resched(), that will allow other
    processes to schedule (avoiding the soft lockups) and also serve as a
    warning should we try to make this loop atomic in the future.
