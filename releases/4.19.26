    net: phylink: avoid resolving link state too early
    
    commit 87454b6edc1b0143fdb3d9853285477e95af74a4 upstream.
    
    During testing on Armada 388 platforms, it was found with a certain
    module configuration that it was possible to trigger a kernel oops
    during the module load process, caused by the phylink resolver being
    triggered for a currently disabled interface.
    
    This problem was introduced by changing the way the SFP registration
    works, which now can result in the sfp link down notification being
    called during phylink_create().

    pinctrl: max77620: Use define directive for max77620_pinconf_param values
    
    commit 1f60652dd586d1b3eee7c4602892a97a62fa937a upstream.
    
    Clang warns when one enumerated type is implicitly converted to another:
    
    drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-max77620.c:56:12: warning: implicit conversion
    from enumeration type 'enum max77620_pinconf_param' to different
    enumeration type 'enum pin_config_param' [-Wenum-conversion]
                    .param = MAX77620_ACTIVE_FPS_SOURCE,
                             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    It is expected that pinctrl drivers can extend pin_config_param because
    of the gap between PIN_CONFIG_END and PIN_CONFIG_MAX so this conversion
    isn't an issue. Most drivers that take advantage of this define the
    PIN_CONFIG variables as constants, rather than enumerated values. Do the
    same thing here so that Clang no longer warns.

    udlfb: handle unplug properly
    
    commit 68a958a915ca912b8ce71b9eea7445996f6e681e upstream.
    
    The udlfb driver maintained an open count and cleaned up itself when the
    count reached zero. But the console is also counted in the reference count
    - so, if the user unplugged the device, the open count would not drop to
    zero and the driver stayed loaded with console attached. If the user
    re-plugged the adapter, it would create a device /dev/fb1, show green
    screen and the access to the console would be lost.
    
    The framebuffer subsystem has reference counting on its own - in order to
    fix the unplug bug, we rely the framebuffer reference counting. When the
    user unplugs the adapter, we call unregister_framebuffer unconditionally.
    unregister_framebuffer will unbind the console, wait until all users stop
    using the framebuffer and then call the fb_destroy method. The fb_destroy
    cleans up the USB driver.
    
    This patch makes the following changes:
    * Drop dlfb->kref and rely on implicit framebuffer reference counting
      instead.
    * dlfb_usb_disconnect calls unregister_framebuffer, the rest of driver
      cleanup is done in the function dlfb_ops_destroy. dlfb_ops_destroy will
      be called by the framebuffer subsystem when no processes have the
      framebuffer open or mapped.
    * We don't use workqueue during initialization, but initialize directly
      from dlfb_usb_probe. The workqueue could race with dlfb_usb_disconnect
      and this racing would produce various kinds of memory corruption.
    * We use usb_get_dev and usb_put_dev to make sure that the USB subsystem
      doesn't free the device under us.

    netfilter: ipt_CLUSTERIP: fix sleep-in-atomic bug in clusterip_config_entry_put()
    
    commit 2a61d8b883bbad26b06d2e6cc3777a697e78830d upstream.
    
    A proc_remove() can sleep. so that it can't be inside of spin_lock.
    Hence proc_remove() is moved to outside of spin_lock. and it also
    adds mutex to sync create and remove of proc entry(config->pde).

    netfilter: nfnetlink_osf: add missing fmatch check
    
    commit 1a6a0951fc009f6d9fe8ebea2d2417d80d54097b upstream.
    
    When we check the tcp options of a packet and it doesn't match the current
    fingerprint, the tcp packet option pointer must be restored to its initial
    value in order to do the proper tcp options check for the next fingerprint.
    
    Here we can see an example.
    Assumming the following fingerprint base with two lines:
    
    S10:64:1:60:M*,S,T,N,W6:      Linux:3.0::Linux 3.0
    S20:64:1:60:M*,S,T,N,W7:      Linux:4.19:arch:Linux 4.1
    
    Where TCP options are the last field in the OS signature, all of them overlap
    except by the last one, ie. 'W6' versus 'W7'.
    
    In case a packet for Linux 4.19 kicks in, the osf finds no matching because the
    TCP options pointer is updated after checking for the TCP options in the first
    line.
    
    Therefore, reset pointer back to where it should be.

    netfilter: ipv6: Don't preserve original oif for loopback address
    
    commit 15df03c661cb362366ecfc3a21820cb934f3e4ca upstream.
    
    Commit 508b09046c0f ("netfilter: ipv6: Preserve link scope traffic
    original oif") made ip6_route_me_harder() keep the original oif for
    link-local and multicast packets. However, it also affected packets
    for the loopback address because it used rt6_need_strict().
    
    REDIRECT rules in the OUTPUT chain rewrite the destination to loopback
    address; thus its oif should not be preserved. This commit fixes the bug
    that redirected local packets are being dropped. Actually the packet was
    not exactly dropped; Instead it was sent out to the original oif rather
    than lo. When a packet with daddr ::1 is sent to the router, it is
    effectively dropped.

    Revert "bridge: do not add port to router list when receives query with source 0.0.0.0"
    
    commit 278e2148c07559dd4ad8602f22366d61eb2ee7b7 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 5a2de63fd1a5 ("bridge: do not add port to router list
    when receives query with source 0.0.0.0") and commit 0fe5119e267f ("net:
    bridge: remove ipv6 zero address check in mcast queries")
    
    The reason is RFC 4541 is not a standard but suggestive. Currently we
    will elect 0.0.0.0 as Querier if there is no ip address configured on
    bridge. If we do not add the port which recives query with source
    0.0.0.0 to router list, the IGMP reports will not be about to forward
    to Querier, IGMP data will also not be able to forward to dest.
    
    As Nikolay suggested, revert this change first and add a boolopt api
    to disable none-zero election in future if needed.

    commit e5e3abbadf0dbd1068f64f8abe70401c5a178180 upstream.
    
    Multiref support means that a compressed page could have
    more than one reference, which is designed for on-disk data
    deduplication. However, mkfs doesn't support this mode
    at this moment, and the kernel implementation is also broken.

    commit 0734ffbf574ee813b20899caef2fe0ed502bb783 upstream.
    
    As described in Kconfig, the last compressed pack should be cached
    for further reading for either `EROFS_FS_ZIP_CACHE_UNIPOLAR' or
    `EROFS_FS_ZIP_CACHE_BIPOLAR' by design.
    
    However, there is a bug in z_erofs_do_read_page, it will
    switch `initial' to `false' at the very beginning before it decides
    to cache the last compressed pack.
    
    caching strategy should work properly after appling this patch.

    net: avoid false positives in untrusted gso validation
    
    commit 9e8db5913264d3967b93c765a6a9e464d9c473db upstream.
    
    GSO packets with vnet_hdr must conform to a small set of gso_types.
    The below commit uses flow dissection to drop packets that do not.
    
    But it has false positives when the skb is not fully initialized.
    Dissection needs skb->protocol and skb->network_header.
    
    Infer skb->protocol from gso_type as the two must agree.
    SKB_GSO_UDP can use both ipv4 and ipv6, so try both.
    
    Exclude callers for which network header offset is not known.

    net: validate untrusted gso packets without csum offload
    
    commit d5be7f632bad0f489879eed0ff4b99bd7fe0b74c upstream.
    
    Syzkaller again found a path to a kernel crash through bad gso input.
    By building an excessively large packet to cause an skb field to wrap.
    
    If VIRTIO_NET_HDR_F_NEEDS_CSUM was set this would have been dropped in
    skb_partial_csum_set.
    
    GSO packets that do not set checksum offload are suspicious and rare.
    Most callers of virtio_net_hdr_to_skb already pass them to
    skb_probe_transport_header.
    
    Move that test forward, change it to detect parse failure and drop
    packets on failure as those cleary are not one of the legitimate
    VIRTIO_NET_HDR_GSO types.

    kvm: x86: Return LA57 feature based on hardware capability
    
    commit 511da98d207d5c0675a10351b01e37cbe50a79e5 upstream.
    
    Previously, 'commit 372fddf70904 ("x86/mm: Introduce the 'no5lvl' kernel
    parameter")' cleared X86_FEATURE_LA57 in boot_cpu_data, if Linux chooses
    to not run in 5-level paging mode. Yet boot_cpu_data is queried by
    do_cpuid_ent() as the host capability later when creating vcpus, and Qemu
    will not be able to detect this feature and create VMs with LA57 feature.
    
    As discussed earlier, VMs can still benefit from extended linear address
    width, e.g. to enhance features like ASLR. So we would like to fix this,
    by return the true hardware capability when Qemu queries.

    gpu: drm: radeon: Set DPM_FLAG_NEVER_SKIP when enabling PM-runtime
    
    commit 450d007d199e632a1a4c4b91302deacd7d56815f upstream.
    
    On HP ProBook 4540s, if PM-runtime is enabled in the radeon driver
    and the direct-complete optimization is used for the radeon device
    during system-wide suspend, the system doesn't resume.
    
    Preventing direct-complete from being used with the radeon device by
    setting the DPM_FLAG_NEVER_SKIP driver flag for it makes the problem
    go away, which indicates that direct-complete is not safe for the
    radeon driver in general and should not be used with it (at least
    for now).
    
    This fixes a regression introduced by commit c62ec4610c40
    ("PM / core: Fix direct_complete handling for devices with no
    callbacks") which allowed direct-complete to be applied to
    devices without PM callbacks (again) which in turn unlocked
    direct-complete for radeon on HP ProBook 4540s.

    Based on a similar patch from Rafael for radeon.
    
    When using ATPX to control dGPU power, the state is not retained
    across suspend and resume cycles by default.  This can probably
    be loosened for Hybrid Graphics (_PR3) laptops where I think the
    state is properly retained.

    ARC: define ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN = 8
    
    commit b6835ea77729e7faf4656ca637ba53f42b8ee3fd upstream.
    
    The default value of ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN in "include/linux/slab.h" is
    "__alignof__(unsigned long long)" which for ARC unexpectedly turns out
    to be 4. This is not a compiler bug, but as defined by ARC ABI [1]
    
    Thus slab allocator would allocate a struct which is 32-bit aligned,
    which is generally OK even if struct has long long members.
    There was however potetial problem when it had any atomic64_t which
    use LLOCKD/SCONDD instructions which are required by ISA to take
    64-bit addresses. This is the problem we ran into

    The fix is to make sure slab allocations are 64-bit aligned.
    
    Do note that atomic64_t is __attribute__((aligned(8)) which means gcc
    does generate 64-bit aligned references, relative to beginning of
    container struct. However the issue is if the container itself is not
    64-bit aligned, atomic64_t ends up unaligned which is what this patch
    ensures.

    ARC: U-boot: check arguments paranoidly
    
    commit a66f2e57bd566240d8b3884eedf503928fbbe557 upstream.
    
    Handle U-boot arguments paranoidly:
     * don't allow to pass unknown tag.
     * try to use external device tree blob only if corresponding tag
       (TAG_DTB) is set.
     * don't check uboot_tag if kernel build with no ARC_UBOOT_SUPPORT.
    
    NOTE:
    If U-boot args are invalid we skip them and try to use embedded device
    tree blob. We can't panic on invalid U-boot args as we really pass
    invalid args due to bug in U-boot code.
    This happens if we don't provide external DTB to U-boot and
    don't set 'bootargs' U-boot environment variable (which is default
    case at least for HSDK board) In that case we will pass
    {r0 = 1 (bootargs in r2); r1 = 0; r2 = 0;} to linux which is invalid.
    
    While I'm at it refactor U-boot arguments handling code.

    parisc: Fix ptrace syscall number modification
    
    commit b7dc5a071ddf69c0350396b203cba32fe5bab510 upstream.
    
    Commit 910cd32e552e ("parisc: Fix and enable seccomp filter support")
    introduced a regression in ptrace-based syscall tampering: when tracer
    changes syscall number to -1, the kernel fails to initialize %r28 with
    -ENOSYS and subsequently fails to return the error code of the failed
    syscall to userspace.
    
    This erroneous behaviour could be observed with a simple strace syscall
    fault injection command which is expected to print something like this:
    
    $ strace -a0 -ewrite -einject=write:error=enospc echo hello
    write(1, "hello\n", 6) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device) (INJECTED)
    write(2, "echo: ", 6) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device) (INJECTED)
    write(2, "write error", 11) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device) (INJECTED)
    write(2, "\n", 1) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device) (INJECTED)
    +++ exited with 1 +++
    
    After commit 910cd32e552ea09caa89cdbe328e468979b030dd it loops printing
    something like this instead:
    
    write(1, "hello\n", 6../strace: Failed to tamper with process 12345: unexpectedly got no error (return value 0, error 0)
    ) = 0 (INJECTED)
    
    This bug was found by strace test suite.

    KEYS: always initialize keyring_index_key::desc_len
    
    commit ede0fa98a900e657d1fcd80b50920efc896c1a4c upstream.
    
    syzbot hit the 'BUG_ON(index_key->desc_len == 0);' in __key_link_begin()
    called from construct_alloc_key() during sys_request_key(), because the
    length of the key description was never calculated.
    
    The problem is that we rely on ->desc_len being initialized by
    search_process_keyrings(), specifically by search_nested_keyrings().
    But, if the process isn't subscribed to any keyrings that never happens.
    
    Fix it by always initializing keyring_index_key::desc_len as soon as the
    description is set, like we already do in some places.
    
    The following program reproduces the BUG_ON() when it's run as root and
    no session keyring has been installed.  If it doesn't work, try removing
    pam_keyinit.so from /etc/pam.d/login and rebooting.
    
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
        #include <keyutils.h>
    
        int main(void)
        {
                int id = add_key("keyring", "syz", NULL, 0, KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING);
    
                keyctl_setperm(id, KEY_OTH_WRITE);
                setreuid(5000, 5000);
                request_key("user", "desc", "", id);
        }

    KEYS: user: Align the payload buffer
    
    commit cc1780fc42c76c705dd07ea123f1143dc5057630 upstream.
    
    Align the payload of "user" and "logon" keys so that users of the
    keyrings service can access it as a struct that requires more than
    2-byte alignment.  fscrypt currently does this which results in the read
    of fscrypt_key::size being misaligned as it needs 4-byte alignment.
    
    Align to __alignof__(u64) rather than __alignof__(long) since in the
    future it's conceivable that people would use structs beginning with
    u64, which on some platforms would require more than 'long' alignment.

    RDMA/srp: Rework SCSI device reset handling
    
    commit 48396e80fb6526ea5ed267bd84f028bae56d2f9e upstream.
    
    Since .scsi_done() must only be called after scsi_queue_rq() has
    finished, make sure that the SRP initiator driver does not call
    .scsi_done() while scsi_queue_rq() is in progress. Although
    invoking sg_reset -d while I/O is in progress works fine with kernel
    v4.20 and before, that is not the case with kernel v5.0-rc1. This
    patch avoids that the following crash is triggered with kernel
    v5.0-rc1:

    net/mlx5e: XDP, fix redirect resources availability check
    
    [ Upstream commit 407e17b1a69a51ba9a512a04342da56c1f931df4 ]
    
    Currently mlx5 driver creates xdp redirect hw queues unconditionally on
    netdevice open, This is great until someone starts redirecting XDP traffic
    via ndo_xdp_xmit on mlx5 device and changes the device configuration at
    the same time, this might cause crashes, since the other device's napi
    is not aware of the mlx5 state change (resources un-availability).
    
    To fix this we must synchronize with other devices napi's on the system.
    Added a new flag under mlx5e_priv to determine XDP TX resources are
    available, set/clear it up when necessary and use synchronize_rcu()
    when the flag is turned off, so other napi's are in-sync with it, before
    we actually cleanup the hw resources.
    
    The flag is tested prior to committing to transmit on mlx5e_xdp_xmit, and
    it is sufficient to determine if it safe to transmit or not. The other
    two internal flags (MLX5E_STATE_OPENED and MLX5E_SQ_STATE_ENABLED) become
    unnecessary. Thus, they are removed from data path.

    net_sched: fix two more memory leaks in cls_tcindex
    
    [ Upstream commit 1db817e75f5b9387b8db11e37d5f0624eb9223e0 ]
    
    struct tcindex_filter_result contains two parts:
    struct tcf_exts and struct tcf_result.
    
    For the local variable 'cr', its exts part is never used but
    initialized without being released properly on success path. So
    just completely remove the exts part to fix this leak.
    
    For the local variable 'new_filter_result', it is never properly
    released if not used by 'r' on success path.

    net_sched: fix a memory leak in cls_tcindex
    
    [ Upstream commit 033b228e7f26b29ae37f8bfa1bc6b209a5365e9f ]
    
    When tcindex_destroy() destroys all the filter results in
    the perfect hash table, it invokes the walker to delete
    each of them. However, results with class==0 are skipped
    in either tcindex_walk() or tcindex_delete(), which causes
    a memory leak reported by kmemleak.
    
    This patch fixes it by skipping the walker and directly
    deleting these filter results so we don't miss any filter
    result.
    
    As a result of this change, we have to initialize exts->net
    properly in tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash(). For net-next, we
    need to consider whether we should initialize ->net in
    tcf_exts_init() instead, before that just directly test
    CONFIG_NET_CLS_ACT=y.

    net_sched: fix a race condition in tcindex_destroy()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8015d93ebd27484418d4952284fd02172fa4b0b2 ]
    
    tcindex_destroy() invokes tcindex_destroy_element() via
    a walker to delete each filter result in its perfect hash
    table, and tcindex_destroy_element() calls tcindex_delete()
    which schedules tcf RCU works to do the final deletion work.
    Unfortunately this races with the RCU callback
    __tcindex_destroy(), which could lead to use-after-free as
    reported by Adrian.
    
    Fix this by migrating this RCU callback to tcf RCU work too,
    as that workqueue is ordered, we will not have use-after-free.
    
    Note, we don't need to hold netns refcnt because we don't call
    tcf_exts_destroy() here.

    sit: check if IPv6 enabled before calling ip6_err_gen_icmpv6_unreach()
    
    [ Upstream commit 173656accaf583698bac3f9e269884ba60d51ef4 ]
    
    If we disabled IPv6 from the kernel command line (ipv6.disable=1), we should
    not call ip6_err_gen_icmpv6_unreach(). This:
    
      ip link add sit1 type sit local 192.0.2.1 remote 192.0.2.2 ttl 1
      ip link set sit1 up
      ip addr add 198.51.100.1/24 dev sit1
      ping 198.51.100.2
    
    if IPv6 is disabled at boot time, will crash the kernel.
    
    v2: there's no need to use in6_dev_get(), use __in6_dev_get() instead,
        as we only need to check that idev exists and we are under
        rcu_read_lock() (from netif_receive_skb_internal()).

    geneve: should not call rt6_lookup() when ipv6 was disabled
    
    [ Upstream commit c0a47e44c0980b3b23ee31fa7936d70ea5dce491 ]
    
    When we add a new GENEVE device with IPv6 remote, checking only for
    IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6) is not enough as we may disable IPv6 in the
    kernel command line (ipv6.disable=1), and calling rt6_lookup() would
    cause a NULL pointer dereference.
    
    v2:
    - don't mix declarations and code (reported by Stefano Brivio, Eric Dumazet)
    - there's no need to use in6_dev_get() as we only need to check that
      idev exists (reported by David Ahern). This is under RTNL, so we can
      simply use __in6_dev_get() instead (Stefano, Eric).

    team: avoid complex list operations in team_nl_cmd_options_set()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2fdeee2549231b1f989f011bb18191f5660d3745 ]
    
    The current opt_inst_list operations inside team_nl_cmd_options_set()
    is too complex to track:
    
        LIST_HEAD(opt_inst_list);
        nla_for_each_nested(...) {
            list_for_each_entry(opt_inst, &team->option_inst_list, list) {
                if (__team_option_inst_tmp_find(&opt_inst_list, opt_inst))
                    continue;
                list_add(&opt_inst->tmp_list, &opt_inst_list);
            }
        }
        team_nl_send_event_options_get(team, &opt_inst_list);
    
    as while we retrieve 'opt_inst' from team->option_inst_list, it could
    be added to the local 'opt_inst_list' for multiple times. The
    __team_option_inst_tmp_find() doesn't work, as the setter
    team_mode_option_set() still calls team->ops.exit() which uses
    ->tmp_list too in __team_options_change_check().
    
    Simplify the list operations by moving the 'opt_inst_list' and
    team_nl_send_event_options_get() into the nla_for_each_nested() loop so
    that it can be guranteed that we won't insert a same list entry for
    multiple times. Therefore, __team_option_inst_tmp_find() can be removed
    too.

    sctp: set stream ext to NULL after freeing it in sctp_stream_outq_migrate
    
    [ Upstream commit af98c5a78517c04adb5fd68bb64b1ad6fe3d473f ]
    
    In sctp_stream_init(), after sctp_stream_outq_migrate() freed the
    surplus streams' ext, but sctp_stream_alloc_out() returns -ENOMEM,
    stream->outcnt will not be set to 'outcnt'.
    
    With the bigger value on stream->outcnt, when closing the assoc and
    freeing its streams, the ext of those surplus streams will be freed
    again since those stream exts were not set to NULL after freeing in
    sctp_stream_outq_migrate(). Then the invalid-free issue reported by
    syzbot would be triggered.

    It was caused by SKB_GSO_CB(skb)->csum_start not set in sctp_gso_segment.
    sctp_gso_segment() calls skb_segment() with 'feature | NETIF_F_HW_CSUM',
    which causes SKB_GSO_CB(skb)->csum_start not to be set in skb_segment().
    
    For TCP/UDP, when feature supports HW_CSUM, CHECKSUM_PARTIAL will be set
    and gso_reset_checksum will be called to set SKB_GSO_CB(skb)->csum_start.
    
    So SCTP should do the same as TCP/UDP, to call gso_reset_checksum() when
    computing checksum in sctp_gso_segment.

    net: sfp: do not probe SFP module before we're attached
    
    [ Upstream commit b5bfc21af5cb3d53f9cee0ef82eaa43762a90f81 ]
    
    When we probe a SFP module, we expect to be able to call the upstream
    device's module_insert() function so that the upstream link can be
    configured.  However, when the upstream device is delayed, we currently
    may end up probing the module before the upstream device is available,
    and lose the module_insert() call.
    
    Avoid this by holding off probing the module until the SFP bus is
    properly connected to both the SFP socket driver and the upstream
    driver.

    net/mlx5e: Don't overwrite pedit action when multiple pedit used
    
    [ Upstream commit 218d05ce326f9e1b40a56085431fa1068b43d5d9 ]
    
    In some case, we may use multiple pedit actions to modify packets.
    The command shown as below: the last pedit action is effective.
    
    $ tc filter add dev netdev_rep parent ffff: protocol ip prio 1    \
            flower skip_sw ip_proto icmp dst_ip 3.3.3.3        \

    To fix it, we add max_mod_hdr_actions to mlx5e_tc_flow_parse_attr struction,
    max_mod_hdr_actions will store the max pedit action number we support and
    num_mod_hdr_actions indicates how many pedit action we used, and store all
    pedit action to mod_hdr_actions.

    net/mlx4_en: Force CHECKSUM_NONE for short ethernet frames
    
    [ Upstream commit 29dded89e80e3fff61efb34f07a8a3fba3ea146d ]
    
    When an ethernet frame is padded to meet the minimum ethernet frame
    size, the padding octets are not covered by the hardware checksum.
    Fortunately the padding octets are usually zero's, which don't affect
    checksum. However, it is not guaranteed. For example, switches might
    choose to make other use of these octets.
    This repeatedly causes kernel hardware checksum fault.
    
    Prior to the cited commit below, skb checksum was forced to be
    CHECKSUM_NONE when padding is detected. After it, we need to keep
    skb->csum updated. However, fixing up CHECKSUM_COMPLETE requires to
    verify and parse IP headers, it does not worth the effort as the packets
    are so small that CHECKSUM_COMPLETE has no significant advantage.
    
    Future work: when reporting checksum complete is not an option for
    IP non-TCP/UDP packets, we can actually fallback to report checksum
    unnecessary, by looking at cqe IPOK bit.

    net: ena: fix race between link up and device initalization
    
    [ Upstream commit e1f1bd9bfbedcfce428ee7e1b82a6ec12d4c3863 ]
    
    Fix race condition between ena_update_on_link_change() and
    ena_restore_device().
    
    This race can occur if link notification arrives while the driver
    is performing a reset sequence. In this case link can be set up,
    enabling the device, before it is fully restored. If packets are
    sent at this time, the driver might access uninitialized data
    structures, causing kernel crash.
    
    Move the clearing of ENA_FLAG_ONGOING_RESET and netif_carrier_on()
    after ena_up() to ensure the device is ready when link is set up.

    inet_diag: fix reporting cgroup classid and fallback to priority
    
    [ Upstream commit 1ec17dbd90f8b638f41ee650558609c1af63dfa0 ]
    
    Field idiag_ext in struct inet_diag_req_v2 used as bitmap of requested
    extensions has only 8 bits. Thus extensions starting from DCTCPINFO
    cannot be requested directly. Some of them included into response
    unconditionally or hook into some of lower 8 bits.
    
    Extension INET_DIAG_CLASS_ID has not way to request from the beginning.
    
    This patch bundle it with INET_DIAG_TCLASS (ipv6 tos), fixes space
    reservation, and documents behavior for other extensions.
    
    Also this patch adds fallback to reporting socket priority. This filed
    is more widely used for traffic classification because ipv4 sockets
    automatically maps TOS to priority and default qdisc pfifo_fast knows
    about that. But priority could be changed via setsockopt SO_PRIORITY so
    INET_DIAG_TOS isn't enough for predicting class.
    
    Also cgroup2 obsoletes net_cls classid (it always zero), but we cannot
    reuse this field for reporting cgroup2 id because it is 64-bit (ino+gen).
    
    So, after this patch INET_DIAG_CLASS_ID will report socket priority
    for most common setup when net_cls isn't set and/or cgroup2 in use.

    This is equivalent to just "\0". Nick pointed out that it is smarter to
    use "" instead of "\0" because "" is used elsewhere in the kernel and
    can be deduplicated at the linking stage.

    mlxsw: spectrum_switchdev: Do not treat static FDB entries as sticky
    
    [ Upstream commit 64254a2054611205798e6bde634639bc704573ac ]
    
    The driver currently treats static FDB entries as both static and
    sticky. This is incorrect and prevents such entries from being roamed to
    a different port via learning.
    
    Fix this by configuring static entries with ageing disabled and roaming
    enabled.
    
    In net-next we can add proper support for the newly introduced 'sticky'
    flag.

    net: bridge: Mark FDB entries that were added by user as such
    
    [ Upstream commit 710ae72877378e7cde611efd30fe90502a6e5b30 ]
    
    Externally learned entries can be added by a user or by a switch driver
    that is notifying the bridge driver about entries that were learned in
    hardware.
    
    In the first case, the entries are not marked with the 'added_by_user'
    flag, which causes switch drivers to ignore them and not offload them.
    
    The 'added_by_user' flag can be set on externally learned FDB entries
    based on the 'swdev_notify' parameter in br_fdb_external_learn_add(),
    which effectively means if the created / updated FDB entry was added by
    a user or not.

    selftests/bpf: retry tests that expect build-id

    While running test_progs in a loop I found out that I'm sometimes hitting
    "Didn't find expected build ID from the map" error.
    
    Looking at stack_map_get_build_id_offset() it seems that it is racy (by
    design) and can sometimes return BPF_STACK_BUILD_ID_IP (i.e. can't trylock
    current->mm->mmap_sem).
    
    Let's retry this test a single time.

    bpf: don't assume build-id length is always 20 bytes
    
    [ Upstream commit 0b698005a9d11c0e91141ec11a2c4918a129f703 ]
    
    Build-id length is not fixed to 20, it can be (`man ld` /--build-id):

      * any length specified in ld --build-id=0xhexstring
    
    To fix the issue of missing BPF_STACK_BUILD_ID_VALID for shorter build-ids,
    assume that build-id is somewhere in the range of 1 .. 20.
    Set the remaining bytes to zero.
    
    v2:
    * don't introduce new "len = min(BPF_BUILD_ID_SIZE, nhdr->n_descsz)",

    [ Upstream commit 4882a27cec24319d10f95e978ecc80050e3e3e15 ]
    
    A cb_interest record is not necessarily attached to the vnode on entry to
    afs_validate(), which can cause an oops when we try to bring the vnode's
    cb_s_break up to date in the default case (ie. no current callback promise
    and the vnode has not been deleted).
    
    Fix this by simply removing the line, as vnode->cb_s_break will be set when
    needed by afs_register_server_cb_interest() when we next get a callback
    promise from RPC call.
    
    The oops looks something like:

    selftests: tc-testing: drop test on missing tunnel key id
    
    [ Upstream commit e413615502a3324daba038f529932ba9a5248af0 ]
    
    After merge of commit 80ef0f22ceda ("net/sched: act_tunnel_key: Allow
    key-less tunnels"), act_tunnel_key does not reject anymore requests to
    install 'set' rules where the key id is missing. Therefore, drop the
    following TDC testcase:
    
     ba4e - Add tunnel_key set action with missing mandatory id parameter
    
    because it's going to become a systematic fail as soon as userspace
    iproute2 will start supporting key-less tunnels.

    drm/sun4i: backend: add missing of_node_puts
    
    [ Upstream commit 4bb0e6d7258213d4893c2c876712fbba40e712fe ]
    
    The device node iterators perform an of_node_get on each
    iteration, so a jump out of the loop requires an of_node_put.
    
    Remote and port also have augmented reference counts, so drop them
    on each iteration and at the end of the function, respectively.
    Remote is only used for the address it contains, not for the
    contents of that address, so the reference count can be dropped
    immediately.
    
    The semantic patch that fixes the first part of this problem is
    as follows (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr):
    
    // <smpl>
    @@
    expression root,e;
    local idexpression child;

    netfilter: nft_flow_offload: fix checking method of conntrack helper
    
    [ Upstream commit 2314e879747e82896f51cce4488f6a00f3e1af7b ]
    
    This patch uses nfct_help() to detect whether an established connection
    needs conntrack helper instead of using test_bit(IPS_HELPER_BIT,
    &ct->status).
    
    The reason is that IPS_HELPER_BIT is only set when using explicit CT
    target.
    
    However, in the case that a device enables conntrack helper via command
    "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_helper", the status of
    IPS_HELPER_BIT will not present any change, and consequently it loses
    the checking ability in the context.

    scsi: tcmu: avoid cmd/qfull timers updated whenever a new cmd comes
    
    [ Upstream commit a94a2572b97744d3a35a1996df0e5cf6b2461a4a ]
    
    Currently there is one cmd timeout timer and one qfull timer for each udev,
    and whenever any new command is coming in we will update the cmd timer or
    qfull timer. For some corner cases the timers are always working only for
    the ringbuffer's and full queue's newest cmd. That's to say the timer won't
    be fired even if one cmd has been stuck for a very long time and the
    deadline is reached.
    
    This fix will keep the cmd/qfull timers to be pended for the oldest cmd in
    ringbuffer and full queue, and will update them with the next cmd's
    deadline only when the old cmd's deadline is reached or removed from the
    ringbuffer and full queue.

    net: stmmac: Prevent RX starvation in stmmac_napi_poll()
    
    [ Upstream commit fa0be0a43f101888ac677dba31b590963eafeaa1 ]
    
    Currently, TX is given a budget which is consumed by stmmac_tx_clean()
    and stmmac_rx() is given the remaining non-consumed budget.
    
    This is wrong and in case we are sending a large number of packets this
    can starve RX because remaining budget will be low.
    
    Let's give always the same budget for RX and TX clean.
    
    While at it, check if we missed any interrupts while we were in NAPI
    callback by looking at DMA interrupt status.

    net: stmmac: Fix PCI module removal leak
    
    [ Upstream commit 6dea7e1881fd86b80da64e476ac398008daed857 ]
    
    Since commit b7d0f08e9129, the enable / disable of PCI device is not
    managed which will result in IO regions not being automatically unmapped.
    As regions continue mapped it is currently not possible to remove and
    then probe again the PCI module of stmmac.
    
    Fix this by manually unmapping regions on remove callback.

    netfilter: nft_flow_offload: fix interaction with vrf slave device
    
    [ Upstream commit 10f4e765879e514e1ce7f52ed26603047af196e2 ]
    
    In the forward chain, the iif is changed from slave device to master vrf
    device. Thus, flow offload does not find a match on the lower slave
    device.
    
    This patch uses the cached route, ie. dst->dev, to update the iif and
    oif fields in the flow entry.
    
    After this patch, the following example works fine:
    
     # ip addr add dev eth0 1.1.1.1/24
     # ip addr add dev eth1 10.0.0.1/24
     # ip link add user1 type vrf table 1
     # ip l set user1 up
     # ip l set dev eth0 master user1
     # ip l set dev eth1 master user1
    
     # nft add table firewall
     # nft add flowtable f fb1 { hook ingress priority 0 \; devices = { eth0, eth1 } \; }
     # nft add chain f ftb-all {type filter hook forward priority 0 \; policy accept \; }
     # nft add rule f ftb-all ct zone 1 ip protocol tcp flow offload @fb1

    pvcalls-front: Avoid get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL) under spinlock
    
    [ Upstream commit 9f51c05dc41a6d69423e3d03d18eb7ab22f9ec19 ]
    
    The problem is that we call this with a spin lock held.
    The call tree is:
    pvcalls_front_accept() holds bedata->socket_lock.
        -> create_active()
            -> __get_free_pages() uses GFP_KERNEL
    
    The create_active() function is only called from pvcalls_front_accept()
    with a spin_lock held, The allocation is not allowed to sleep and
    GFP_KERNEL is not sufficient.
    
    This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
    
    v2: Add a function doing the allocations which is called
        outside the lock and passing the allocated data to
        create_active().
    
    v3: Use the matching deallocators i.e., free_page()
        and free_pages(), respectively.
    
    v4: It would be better to pre-populate map (struct sock_mapping),
        rather than introducing one more new struct.
    
    v5: Since allocating the data outside of this call it should also
        be freed outside, when create_active() fails.
        Move kzalloc(sizeof(*map2), GFP_ATOMIC) outside spinlock and
        use GFP_KERNEL instead.
    
    v6: Drop the superfluous calls.

    The existing BPF TCP initial congestion window (TCP_BPF_IW) does not
    to work on (active) Fast Open sender. This is because it changes the
    (initial) window only if data_segs_out is zero -- but data_segs_out
    is also incremented on SYN-data.  This patch fixes the issue by
    proerly accounting for SYN-data additionally.

    include/linux/compiler*.h: fix OPTIMIZER_HIDE_VAR
    
    [ Upstream commit 3e2ffd655cc6a694608d997738989ff5572a8266 ]
    
    Since commit 815f0ddb346c ("include/linux/compiler*.h: make compiler-*.h
    mutually exclusive") clang no longer reuses the OPTIMIZER_HIDE_VAR macro
    from compiler-gcc - instead it gets the version in
    include/linux/compiler.h.  Unfortunately that version doesn't actually
    prevent compiler from optimizing out the variable.
    
    Fix up by moving the macro out from compiler-gcc.h to compiler.h.
    Compilers without incline asm support will keep working
    since it's protected by an ifdef.
    
    Also fix up comments to match reality since we are no longer overriding
    any macros.
    
    Build-tested with gcc and clang.

    scsi: isci: initialize shost fully before calling scsi_add_host()
    
    [ Upstream commit cc29a1b0a3f2597ce887d339222fa85b9307706d ]
    
    scsi_mq_setup_tags(), which is called by scsi_add_host(), calculates the
    command size to allocate based on the prot_capabilities. In the isci
    driver, scsi_host_set_prot() is called after scsi_add_host() so the command
    size gets calculated to be smaller than it needs to be.  Eventually,
    scsi_mq_init_request() locates the 'prot_sdb' after the command assuming it
    was sized correctly and a buffer overrun may occur.
    
    However, seeing blk_mq_alloc_rqs() rounds up to the nearest cache line
    size, the mistake can go unnoticed.
    
    The bug was noticed after the struct request size was reduced by commit
    9d037ad707ed ("block: remove req->timeout_list")
    
    Which likely reduced the allocated space for the request by an entire cache

    netfilter: nf_tables: fix leaking object reference count
    
    [ Upstream commit b91d9036883793122cf6575ca4dfbfbdd201a83d ]
    
    There is no code that decreases the reference count of stateful objects
    in error path of the nft_add_set_elem(). this causes a leak of reference
    count of stateful objects.
    
    Test commands:
       $nft add table ip filter
       $nft add counter ip filter c1
       $nft add map ip filter m1 { type ipv4_addr : counter \;}
       $nft add element ip filter m1 { 1 : c1 }
       $nft add element ip filter m1 { 1 : c1 }
       $nft delete element ip filter m1 { 1 }
       $nft delete counter ip filter c1
    
    Result:
       Error: Could not process rule: Device or resource busy
       delete counter ip filter c1
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
    At the second 'nft add element ip filter m1 { 1 : c1 }', the reference
    count of the 'c1' is increased then it tries to insert into the 'm1'. but
    the 'm1' already has same element so it returns -EEXIST.
    But it doesn't decrease the reference count of the 'c1' in the error path.
    Due to a leak of the reference count of the 'c1', the 'c1' can't be
    removed by 'nft delete counter ip filter c1'.

    net/mlx4: Get rid of page operation after dma_alloc_coherent
    
    [ Upstream commit f65e192af35058e5c82da9e90871b472d24912bc ]
    
    This patch solves a crash at the time of mlx4 driver unload or system
    shutdown. The crash occurs because dma_alloc_coherent() returns one
    value in mlx4_alloc_icm_coherent(), but a different value is passed to
    dma_free_coherent() in mlx4_free_icm_coherent(). In turn this is because
    when allocated, that pointer is passed to sg_set_buf() to record it,
    then when freed it is re-calculated by calling
    lowmem_page_address(sg_page()) which returns a different value. Solve
    this by recording the value that dma_alloc_coherent() returns, and
    passing this to dma_free_coherent().
    
    This patch is roughly equivalent to commit 378efe798ecf ("RDMA/hns: Get
    rid of page operation after dma_alloc_coherent").

    selftests/bpf: Test [::] -> [::1] rewrite in sys_sendmsg in test_sock_addr
    
    [ Upstream commit 976b4f3a4646fbf0d189caca25f91f82e4be4b5a ]
    
    Test that sys_sendmsg BPF hook doesn't break sys_sendmsg behaviour to
    rewrite destination IPv6 = [::] with [::1] (BSD'ism).
    
    Two test cases are added:
    
    1) User passes dst IPv6 = [::] and BPF_CGROUP_UDP6_SENDMSG program
       doesn't touch it.
    
    2) User passes dst IPv6 != [::], but BPF_CGROUP_UDP6_SENDMSG program
       rewrites it with [::].
    
    In both cases [::1] is used by sys_sendmsg code eventually and datagram
    is sent successfully for unconnected UDP socket.
    
    Example of relevant output:
      Test case: sendmsg6: set dst IP = [::] (BSD'ism) .. [PASS]
      Test case: sendmsg6: preserve dst IP = [::] (BSD'ism) .. [PASS]

    bpf: Fix [::] -> [::1] rewrite in sys_sendmsg
    
    [ Upstream commit e8e36984080b55ac5e57bdb09a5b570f2fc8e963 ]
    
    sys_sendmsg has supported unspecified destination IPv6 (wildcard) for
    unconnected UDP sockets since 876c7f41. When [::] is passed by user as
    destination, sys_sendmsg rewrites it with [::1] to be consistent with
    BSD (see "BSD'ism" comment in the code).
    
    This didn't work when cgroup-bpf was enabled though since the rewrite
    [::] -> [::1] happened before passing control to cgroup-bpf block where
    fl6.daddr was updated with passed by user sockaddr_in6.sin6_addr (that
    might or might not be changed by BPF program). That way if user passed
    [::] as dst IPv6 it was first rewritten with [::1] by original code from
    876c7f41, but then rewritten back with [::] by cgroup-bpf block.
    
    It happened even when BPF_CGROUP_UDP6_SENDMSG program was not present
    (CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF=y was enough).
    
    The fix is to apply BSD'ism after cgroup-bpf block so that [::] is
    replaced with [::1] no matter where it came from: passed by user to
    sys_sendmsg or set by BPF_CGROUP_UDP6_SENDMSG program.

    mfd: mc13xxx: Fix a missing check of a register-read failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e28989d41c0eab57ec0bb156617a8757406ff8a ]
    
    When mc13xxx_reg_read() fails, "old_adc0" is uninitialized and will
    contain random value. Further execution uses "old_adc0" even when
    mc13xxx_reg_read() fails.
    The fix checks the return value of mc13xxx_reg_read(), and exits
    the execution when it fails.

    [ Upstream commit 753a8d083e085c6f552c7982749de4cc7c40e2ac ]
    
    In the axp20x driver, the various mfd_cell lists had varying amounts
    of indentation, sometimes even within the same list. For the axp288,
    there's no alignment at all.
    
    Re-align the right hand side of the assignments with the least amount
    of tabs possible. Also collapse the closing bracket and the opening
    bracket of the next entry onto the same line for the axp288, to be
    consistent with all the other mfd_cell lists.
    
    This patch is whitespace change only. No functionality is modified.

    This function is supposed to return zero on success or negative error
    codes on error.  Unfortunately, there is a bug so it sometimes returns
    non-zero, positive numbers on success.
    
    I noticed this bug during review and I can't test it.  It does appear
    that the return is sometimes propogated back to _regmap_read() where all
    non-zero returns are treated as failure so this may affect run time.

    Commit 88ba95bedb79 ("backlight: pwm_bl: Compute brightness of LED linearly

    settings were handled below the brightness handling, like power-on-delays
    and also setting the pdata enable-gpio to -EINVAL.
    
    This surfaces for example in the case of a backlight without any
    enable-gpio which then tries to use gpio-0 in error.
    
    Fix this by simply moving the trailing settings above the brightness
    handling.

    KEYS: allow reaching the keys quotas exactly
    
    commit a08bf91ce28ed3ae7b6fef35d843fef8dc8c2cd9 upstream.
    
    If the sysctl 'kernel.keys.maxkeys' is set to some number n, then
    actually users can only add up to 'n - 1' keys.  Likewise for
    'kernel.keys.maxbytes' and the root_* versions of these sysctls.  But
    these sysctls are apparently supposed to be *maximums*, as per their
    names and all documentation I could find -- the keyrings(7) man page,
    Documentation/security/keys/core.rst, and all the mentions of EDQUOT
    meaning that the key quota was *exceeded* (as opposed to reached).
    
    Thus, fix the code to allow reaching the quotas exactly.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Disable PC beep in passthrough on alc285
    
    commit c8c6ee611926685a7d753409e0a6e48b9e1b8748 upstream.
    
    It is reported that there's a constant background "hum/whitenoise"
    in the headset on the Lenovo X1 machines with the codec alc285, and it
    is confirmed that if we run the command below, the noise will stop.
     sudo hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC0D0 0x1d SET_PIN_WIDGET_CONTROL 0x0
    
    Then I consulted this issue with Kailang, he told me the pin 0x1d on
    this codec is used for PC beep in, the noise probably comes from this
    pin and we can also disable the PC beep in passthrough, then the PC

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Headset microphone and internal speaker support for System76 oryp5
    
    commit 7f665b1c3283aae5b61843136d0a8ee808ba3199 upstream.
    
    On the System76 Oryx Pro (oryp5), there is a headset microphone input
    attached to 0x19 that does not have a jack detect. In order to get it
    working, the pin configuration needs to be set correctly, and the
    ALC269_FIXUP_HEADSET_MODE_NO_HP_MIC fixup needs to be applied. This is
    similar to the MIC_NO_PRESENCE fixups for some Dell laptops, except we
    have a separate microphone jack that is already configured correctly.
    
    Since the ALC1220 does not have a fixup similar to
    ALC269_FIXUP_HEADSET_MODE_NO_HP_MIC, I have exposed the fixup from the
    ALC269 in a way that it can be accessed from the
    alc1220_fixup_system76_oryp5 function. In addition, the
    alc1220_fixup_clevo_p950 needs to be applied to gain speaker output.

    proc, oom: do not report alien mms when setting oom_score_adj
    
    commit b2b469939e93458753cfbf8282ad52636495965e upstream.
    
    Tetsuo has reported that creating a thousands of processes sharing MM
    without SIGHAND (aka alien threads) and setting
    /proc/<pid>/oom_score_adj will swamp the kernel log and takes ages [1]
    to finish.  This is especially worrisome that all that printing is done
    under RCU lock and this can potentially trigger RCU stall or softlockup
    detector.
    
    The primary reason for the printk was to catch potential users who might
    depend on the behavior prior to 44a70adec910 ("mm, oom_adj: make sure
    processes sharing mm have same view of oom_score_adj") but after more
    than 2 years without a single report I guess it is safe to simply remove
    the printk altogether.
    
    The next step should be moving oom_score_adj over to the mm struct and
    remove all the tasks crawling as suggested by [2]

    numa: change get_mempolicy() to use nr_node_ids instead of MAX_NUMNODES
    
    commit 050c17f239fd53adb55aa768d4f41bc76c0fe045 upstream.
    
    The system call, get_mempolicy() [1], passes an unsigned long *nodemask
    pointer and an unsigned long maxnode argument which specifies the length
    of the user's nodemask array in bits (which is rounded up).  The manual
    page says that if the maxnode value is too small, get_mempolicy will
    return EINVAL but there is no system call to return this minimum value.
    To determine this value, some programs search /proc/<pid>/status for a
    line starting with "Mems_allowed:" and use the number of digits in the
    mask to determine the minimum value.  A recent change to the way this line
    is formatted [2] causes these programs to compute a value less than
    MAX_NUMNODES so get_mempolicy() returns EINVAL.
    
    Change get_mempolicy(), the older compat version of get_mempolicy(), and
    the copy_nodes_to_user() function to use nr_node_ids instead of
    MAX_NUMNODES, thus preserving the defacto method of computing the minimum
    size for the nodemask array and the maxnode argument.

    libceph: handle an empty authorize reply
    
    commit 0fd3fd0a9bb0b02b6435bb7070e9f7b82a23f068 upstream.
    
    The authorize reply can be empty, for example when the ticket used to
    build the authorizer is too old and TAG_BADAUTHORIZER is returned from
    the service.  Calling ->verify_authorizer_reply() results in an attempt
    to decrypt and validate (somewhat) random data in au->buf (most likely
    the signature block from calc_signature()), which fails and ends up in
    con_fault_finish() with !con->auth_retry.  The ticket isn't invalidated
    and the connection is retried again and again until a new ticket is
    obtained from the monitor:
    
      libceph: osd2 192.168.122.1:6809 bad authorize reply
      libceph: osd2 192.168.122.1:6809 bad authorize reply

    Let TAG_BADAUTHORIZER handler kick in and increment con->auth_retry.

    mac80211: Use linked list instead of rhashtable walk for mesh tables
    
    commit b4c3fbe6360178dc2181b7b43b7ae793a192b282 upstream.
    
    The mesh table code walks over hash tables for two purposes.  First of
    all it's used as part of a netlink dump process, but it is also used
    for looking up entries to delete using criteria other than the hash
    key.
    
    The second purpose is directly contrary to the design specification
    of rhashtable walks.  It is only meant for use by netlink dumps.
    
    This is because rhashtable is resizable and you cannot obtain a
    stable walk over it during a resize process.
    
    In fact mesh's use of rhashtable for dumping is bogus too.  Rather
    than using rhashtable walk's iterator to keep track of the current
    position, it always converts the current position to an integer
    which defeats the purpose of the iterator.
    
    Therefore this patch converts all uses of rhashtable walk into a
    simple linked list.
    
    This patch also adds a new spin lock to protect the hash table
    insertion/removal as well as the walk list modifications.  In fact
    the previous code was buggy as the removals can race with each
    other, potentially resulting in a double-free.

    mac80211: Restore vif beacon interval if start ap fails
    
    commit 83e37e0bdd1470bbe6612250b745ad39b1a7b130 upstream.
    
    The starting of AP interface can fail due to invalid
    beacon interval, which does not match the minimum gcd
    requirement set by the wifi driver. In such case, the
    beacon interval of that interface gets updated with
    that invalid beacon interval.
    
    The next time that interface is brought up in AP mode,
    an interface combination check is performed and the
    beacon interval is taken from the previously set value.
    
    In a case where an invalid beacon interval, i.e. a beacon
    interval value which does not satisfy the minimum gcd criteria
    set by the driver, is set, all the subsequent trials to
    bring that interface in AP mode will fail, even if the
    subsequent trials have a valid beacon interval.
    
    To avoid this, in case of a failure in bringing up an
    interface in AP mode due to interface combination error,
    the interface beacon interval which is stored in bss
    conf, needs to be restored with the last working value
    of beacon interval.
    
    Tested on ath10k using WCN3990.

    MIPS: eBPF: Always return sign extended 32b values
    
    commit 13443154f6cac61d148471ede6d7f1f6b5ea946a upstream.
    
    The function prototype used to call JITed eBPF code (ie. the type of the
    struct bpf_prog bpf_func field) returns an unsigned int. The MIPS n64
    ABI that MIPS64 kernels target defines that 32 bit integers should
    always be sign extended when passed in registers as either arguments or
    return values.
    
    This means that when returning any value which may not already be sign
    extended (ie. of type REG_64BIT or REG_32BIT_ZERO_EX) we need to perform
    that sign extension in order to comply with the n64 ABI. Without this we
    see strange looking test failures from test_bpf.ko, such as:
    
      test_bpf: #65 ALU64_MOV_X:
        dst = 4294967295 jited:1 ret -1 != -1 FAIL (1 times)
    
    Although the return value printed matches the expected value, this is
    only because printf is only examining the least significant 32 bits of
    the 64 bit register value we returned. The register holding the expected
    value is sign extended whilst the v0 register was set to a zero extended
    value by our JITed code, so when compared by a conditional branch
    instruction the values are not equal.
    
    We already handle this when the return value register is of type
    REG_32BIT_ZERO_EX, so simply extend this to also cover REG_64BIT.
