    Corrected the register to check the 64-bit pointer
    capability state. 64-bit pointer implementation capability
    was checking in wrong register, which causes the BDC
    enumeration failure in 64-bit memory address.

    btrfs: Fix use-after-free when cleaning up fs_devs with a single stale device
    
    commit fd649f10c3d21ee9d7542c609f29978bdf73ab94 upstream.
    
    Commit 4fde46f0cc71 ("Btrfs: free the stale device") introduced
    btrfs_free_stale_device which iterates the device lists for all
    registered btrfs filesystems and deletes those devices which aren't
    mounted. In a btrfs_devices structure has only 1 device attached to it
    and it is unused then btrfs_free_stale_devices will proceed to also free
    the btrfs_fs_devices struct itself. Currently this leads to a use after
    free since list_for_each_entry will try to perform a check on the
    already freed memory to see if it has to terminate the loop.
    
    The fix is to use 'break' when we know we are freeing the current
    fs_devs.

    btrfs: alloc_chunk: fix DUP stripe size handling
    
    commit 92e222df7b8f05c565009c7383321b593eca488b upstream.
    
    In case of using DUP, we search for enough unallocated disk space on a
    device to hold two stripes.
    
    The devices_info[ndevs-1].max_avail that holds the amount of unallocated
    space found is directly assigned to stripe_size, while it's actually
    twice the stripe size.
    
    Later on in the code, an unconditional division of stripe_size by
    dev_stripes corrects the value, but in the meantime there's a check to
    see if the stripe_size does not exceed max_chunk_size. Since during this
    check stripe_size is twice the amount as intended, the check will reduce
    the stripe_size to max_chunk_size if the actual correct to be used
    stripe_size is more than half the amount of max_chunk_size.
    
    The unconditional division later tries to correct stripe_size, but will
    actually make sure we can't allocate more than half the max_chunk_size.
    
    Fix this by moving the division by dev_stripes before the max chunk size
    check, so it always contains the right value, instead of putting a duct
    tape division in further on to get it fixed again.
    
    Since in all other cases than DUP, dev_stripes is 1, this change only
    affects DUP.
    
    Other attempts in the past were made to fix this:
    * 37db63a400 "Btrfs: fix max chunk size check in chunk allocator" tried
    to fix the same problem, but still resulted in part of the code acting
    on a wrongly doubled stripe_size value.
    * 86db25785a "Btrfs: fix max chunk size on raid5/6" unintentionally
    broke this fix again.
    
    The real problem was already introduced with the rest of the code in
    73c5de0051.
    
    The user visible result however will be that the max chunk size for DUP
    will suddenly double, while it's actually acting according to the limits
    in the code again like it was 5 years ago.

    irqchip/gic-v3-its: Ensure nr_ites >= nr_lpis
    
    commit 4f2c7583e33eb08dc09dd2e25574b80175ba7d93 upstream.
    
    When struct its_device instances are created, the nr_ites member
    will be set to a power of 2 that equals or exceeds the requested
    number of MSIs passed to the msi_prepare() callback. At the same
    time, the LPI map is allocated to be some multiple of 32 in size,
    where the allocated size may be less than the requested size
    depending on whether a contiguous range of sufficient size is
    available in the global LPI bitmap.
    
    This may result in the situation where the nr_ites < nr_lpis, and
    since nr_ites is what we program into the hardware when we map the
    device, the additional LPIs will be non-functional.
    
    For bog standard hardware, this does not really matter. However,
    in cases where ITS device IDs are shared between different PCIe
    devices, we may end up allocating these additional LPIs without
    taking into account that they don't actually work.
    
    So let's make nr_ites at least 32. This ensures that all allocated
    LPIs are 'live', and that its_alloc_device_irq() will fail when
    attempts are made to allocate MSIs beyond what was allocated in
    the first place.

    fs/aio: Add explicit RCU grace period when freeing kioctx
    
    commit a6d7cff472eea87d96899a20fa718d2bab7109f3 upstream.
    
    While fixing refcounting, e34ecee2ae79 ("aio: Fix a trinity splat")
    incorrectly removed explicit RCU grace period before freeing kioctx.
    The intention seems to be depending on the internal RCU grace periods
    of percpu_ref; however, percpu_ref uses a different flavor of RCU,
    sched-RCU.  This can lead to kioctx being freed while RCU read
    protected dereferences are still in progress.
    
    Fix it by updating free_ioctx() to go through call_rcu() explicitly.

    lock_parent() needs to recheck if dentry got __dentry_kill'ed under it
    
    commit 3b821409632ab778d46e807516b457dfa72736ed upstream.
    
    In case when dentry passed to lock_parent() is protected from freeing only
    by the fact that it's on a shrink list and trylock of parent fails, we
    could get hit by __dentry_kill() (and subsequent dentry_kill(parent))
    between unlocking dentry and locking presumed parent.  We need to recheck
    that dentry is alive once we lock both it and parent *and* postpone
    rcu_read_unlock() until after that point.  Otherwise we could return
    a pointer to struct dentry that already is rcu-scheduled for freeing, with
    ->d_lock held on it; caller's subsequent attempt to unlock it can end
    up with memory corruption.

    fs: Teach path_connected to handle nfs filesystems with multiple roots.
    
    commit 95dd77580ccd66a0da96e6d4696945b8cea39431 upstream.
    
    On nfsv2 and nfsv3 the nfs server can export subsets of the same
    filesystem and report the same filesystem identifier, so that the nfs
    client can know they are the same filesystem.  The subsets can be from
    disjoint directory trees.  The nfsv2 and nfsv3 filesystems provides no
    way to find the common root of all directory trees exported form the
    server with the same filesystem identifier.
    
    The practical result is that in struct super s_root for nfs s_root is
    not necessarily the root of the filesystem.  The nfs mount code sets
    s_root to the root of the first subset of the nfs filesystem that the
    kernel mounts.
    
    This effects the dcache invalidation code in generic_shutdown_super
    currently called shrunk_dcache_for_umount and that code for years
    has gone through an additional list of dentries that might be dentry
    trees that need to be freed to accomodate nfs.
    
    When I wrote path_connected I did not realize nfs was so special, and
    it's hueristic for avoiding calling is_subdir can fail.
    
    The practical case where this fails is when there is a move of a
    directory from the subtree exposed by one nfs mount to the subtree
    exposed by another nfs mount.  This move can happen either locally or
    remotely.  With the remote case requiring that the move directory be cached
    before the move and that after the move someone walks the path
    to where the move directory now exists and in so doing causes the
    already cached directory to be moved in the dcache through the magic
    of d_splice_alias.
    
    If someone whose working directory is in the move directory or a
    subdirectory and now starts calling .. from the initial mount of nfs
    (where s_root == mnt_root), then path_connected as a heuristic will
    not bother with the is_subdir check.  As s_root really is not the root
    of the nfs filesystem this heuristic is wrong, and the path may
    actually not be connected and path_connected can fail.
    
    The is_subdir function might be cheap enough that we can call it
    unconditionally.  Verifying that will take some benchmarking and
    the result may not be the same on all kernels this fix needs
    to be backported to.  So I am avoiding that for now.
    
    Filesystems with snapshots such as nilfs and btrfs do something
    similar.  But as the directory tree of the snapshots are disjoint
    from one another and from the main directory tree rename won't move
    things between them and this problem will not occur.

    Turning off the sink in this case causes various issues, because
    userspace expects it to stay on until it turns it off explicitly.
    
    Instead, turn the sink off and back on when a display is connected
    again. This dance seems necessary for link training to work correctly.

    ALSA: seq: Clear client entry before deleting else at closing
    
    commit a2ff19f7b70118ced291a28d5313469914de451b upstream.
    
    When releasing a client, we need to clear the clienttab[] entry at
    first, then call snd_seq_queue_client_leave().  Otherwise, the
    in-flight cell in the queue might be picked up by the timer interrupt
    via snd_seq_check_queue() before calling snd_seq_queue_client_leave(),
    and it's delivered to another queue while the client is clearing
    queues.  This may eventually result in an uncleared cell remaining in
    a queue, and the later snd_seq_pool_delete() may need to wait for a
    long time until the event gets really processed.
    
    By moving the clienttab[] clearance at the beginning of release, any
    event delivery of a cell belonging to this client will fail at a later
    point, since snd_seq_client_ptr() returns NULL.  Thus the cell that
    was picked up by the timer interrupt will be returned immediately
    without further delivery, and the long stall of snd_seq_delete_pool()
    can be avoided, too.

    ALSA: seq: Fix possible UAF in snd_seq_check_queue()
    
    commit d0f833065221cbfcbadf19fd4102bcfa9330006a upstream.
    
    Although we've covered the races between concurrent write() and
    ioctl() in the previous patch series, there is still a possible UAF in
    the following scenario:
    
    A: user client closed           B: timer irq
      -> snd_seq_release()            -> snd_seq_timer_interrupt()
        -> snd_seq_free_client()        -> snd_seq_check_queue()
                                          -> cell = snd_seq_prioq_cell_peek()
          -> snd_seq_prioq_leave()
             .... removing all cells
          -> snd_seq_pool_done()
             .... vfree()
                                          -> snd_seq_compare_tick_time(cell)
                                             ... Oops
    
    So the problem is that a cell is peeked and accessed without any
    protection until it's retrieved from the queue again via
    snd_seq_prioq_cell_out().
    
    This patch tries to address it, also cleans up the code by a slight
    refactoring.  snd_seq_prioq_cell_out() now receives an extra pointer
    argument.  When it's non-NULL, the function checks the event timestamp
    with the given pointer.  The caller needs to pass the right reference
    either to snd_seq_tick or snd_seq_realtime depending on the event
    timestamp type.
    
    A good news is that the above change allows us to remove the
    snd_seq_prioq_cell_peek(), too, thus the patch actually reduces the
    code size.

    ALSA: hda - Revert power_save option default value
    
    commit 40088dc4e1ead7df31728c73f5b51d71da18831d upstream.
    
    With the commit 1ba8f9d30817 ("ALSA: hda: Add a power_save
    blacklist"), we changed the default value of power_save option to -1
    for processing the power-save blacklist.
    Unfortunately, this seems breaking user-space applications that
    actually read the power_save parameter value via sysfs and judge /
    adjust the power-saving status.  They see the value -1 as if the
    power-save is turned off, although the actual value is taken from
    CONFIG_SND_HDA_POWER_SAVE_DEFAULT and it can be a positive.
    
    So, overall, passing -1 there was no good idea.  Let's partially
    revert it -- at least for power_save option default value is restored
    again to CONFIG_SND_HDA_POWER_SAVE_DEFAULT.  Meanwhile, in this patch,
    we keep the blacklist behavior and make is adjustable via the new
    option, pm_blacklist.

    parisc: Handle case where flush_cache_range is called with no context
    
    commit 9ef0f88fe5466c2ca1d2975549ba6be502c464c1 upstream.
    
    Just when I had decided that flush_cache_range() was always called with
    a valid context, Helge reported two cases where the
    "BUG_ON(!vma->vm_mm->context);" was hit on the phantom buildd:
    
     kernel BUG at /mnt/sdb6/linux/linux-4.15.4/arch/parisc/kernel/cache.c:587!

    This indicates that we need to handle the no context case in
    flush_cache_range() as we do in flush_cache_mm().
    
    In thinking about this, I realized that we don't need to flush the TLB
    when there is no context.  So, I added context checks to the large flush
    cases in flush_cache_mm() and flush_cache_range().  The large flush case
    occurs frequently in flush_cache_mm() and the change should improve fork
    performance.
    
    The v2 version of this change removes the BUG_ON from flush_cache_page()
    by skipping the TLB flush when there is no context.  I also added code
    to flush the TLB in flush_cache_mm() and flush_cache_range() when we
    have a context that's not current.  Now all three routines handle TLB
    flushes in a similar manner.

    selftests/x86: Add tests for the STR and SLDT instructions
    
    commit a9e017d5619eb371460c8e516f4684def62bef3a upstream.
    
    The STR and SLDT instructions are not valid when running on virtual-8086
    mode and generate an invalid operand exception. These two instructions are
    protected by the Intel User-Mode Instruction Prevention (UMIP) security
    feature. In protected mode, if UMIP is enabled, these instructions generate
    a general protection fault if called from CPL > 0. Linux traps the general
    protection fault and emulates the instructions sgdt, sidt and smsw; but not
    str and sldt.
    
    These tests are added to verify that the emulation code does not emulate
    these two instructions but the expected invalid operand exception is
    seen.
    
    Tests fallback to exit with INT3 in case emulation does happen.

    selftests/x86: Add tests for User-Mode Instruction Prevention
    
    commit 9390afebe1d3f5a0be18b1afdd0ce09d67cebf9e upstream.
    
    Certain user space programs that run on virtual-8086 mode may utilize
    instructions protected by the User-Mode Instruction Prevention (UMIP)
    security feature present in new Intel processors: SGDT, SIDT and SMSW. In
    such a case, a general protection fault is issued if UMIP is enabled. When
    such a fault happens, the kernel traps it and emulates the results of
    these instructions with dummy values. The purpose of this new
    test is to verify whether the impacted instructions can be executed
    without causing such #GP. If no #GP exceptions occur, we expect to exit
    virtual-8086 mode from INT3.
    
    The instructions protected by UMIP are executed in representative use
    cases:
    
     a) displacement-only memory addressing
     b) register-indirect memory addressing
     c) results stored directly in operands
    
    Unfortunately, it is not possible to check the results against a set of
    expected values because no emulation will occur in systems that do not
    have the UMIP feature. Instead, results are printed for verification. A
    simple verification is done to ensure that results of all tests are
    identical.

    x86/boot/32: Fix UP boot on Quark and possibly other platforms
    
    commit d2b6dc61a8dd3c429609b993778cb54e75a5c5f0 upstream.
    
    This partially reverts commit:
    
      23b2a4ddebdd17f ("x86/boot/32: Defer resyncing initial_page_table until per-cpu is set up")
    
    That commit had one definite bug and one potential bug.  The
    definite bug is that setup_per_cpu_areas() uses a differnet generic
    implementation on UP kernels, so initial_page_table never got
    resynced.  This was fine for access to percpu data (it's in the
    identity map on UP), but it breaks other users of
    initial_page_table.  The potential bug is that helpers like
    efi_init() would be called before the tables were synced.
    
    Avoid both problems by just syncing the page tables in setup_arch()
    *and* setup_per_cpu_areas().

    ima: relax requiring a file signature for new files with zero length
    
    
    [ Upstream commit b7e27bc1d42e8e0cc58b602b529c25cd0071b336 ]
    
    Custom policies can require file signatures based on LSM labels.  These
    files are normally created and only afterwards labeled, requiring them
    to be signed.
    
    Instead of requiring file signatures based on LSM labels, entire
    filesystems could require file signatures.  In this case, we need the
    ability of writing new files without requiring file signatures.
    
    The definition of a "new" file was originally defined as any file with
    a length of zero.  Subsequent patches redefined a "new" file to be based
    on the FILE_CREATE open flag.  By combining the open flag with a file
    size of zero, this patch relaxes the file signature requirement.

    ipvlan: add L2 check for packets arriving via virtual devices
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 92ff42645028fa6f9b8aa767718457b9264316b4 ]
    
    Packets that don't have dest mac as the mac of the master device should
    not be entertained by the IPvlan rx-handler. This is mostly true as the
    packet path mostly takes care of that, except when the master device is
    a virtual device. As demonstrated in the following case -
    
      ip netns add ns1
      ip link add ve1 type veth peer name ve2
      ip link add link ve2 name iv1 type ipvlan mode l2
      ip link set dev iv1 netns ns1
      ip link set ve1 up
      ip link set ve2 up
      ip -n ns1 link set iv1 up
      ip addr add 192.168.10.1/24 dev ve1
      ip -n ns1 addr 192.168.10.2/24 dev iv1
      ping -c2 192.168.10.2
      <Works!>
      ip neigh show dev ve1
      ip neigh show 192.168.10.2 lladdr <random> dev ve1
      ping -c2 192.168.10.2
      <Still works! Wrong!!>
    
    This patch adds that missing check in the IPvlan rx-handler.

    [ Upstream commit e16ea4bb516bc21ea2202f2107718b29218bea59 ]
    
    Enforce using PS_MANUAL_POLL in ps hwsim debugfs to trigger a poll,
    only if PS_ENABLED was set before.
    This is required due to commit c9491367b759 ("mac80211: always update the

    check only mgmt/data frames ps bit, and then update station's power save
    accordingly.
    When sending only ps-poll (control frame) the ap will not be aware that
    the station entered power save.
    Setting ps enable before triggering ps_poll, will send NDP with PM bit
    enabled first.

    agp/intel: Flush all chipset writes after updating the GGTT
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 8516673a996870ea0ceb337ee4f83c33c5ec3111 ]
    
    Before accessing the GGTT we must flush the PTE writes and make them
    visible to the chipset, or else the indirect access may end up in the
    wrong page. In commit 3497971a71d8 ("agp/intel: Flush chipset writes
    after updating a single PTE"), we noticed corruption of the uploads for
    pwrite and for capturing GPU error states, but it was presumed that the
    explicit calls to intel_gtt_chipset_flush() were sufficient for the
    execbuffer path. However, we have not been flushing the chipset between
    the PTE writes and access via the GTT itself.
    
    For simplicity, do the flush after any PTE update rather than try and
    batch the flushes on a just-in-time basis.

    When attempting to load a livepatch module, I got the following error:

    The error was triggered by the following code in

    GCC didn't insert a nop after the branch to net_set_todo() because it's

    media: vsp1: Prevent suspending and resuming DRM pipelines
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a17d2d6cd9985ca09a9e384f1bc71d710f7e5203 ]
    
    When used as part of a display pipeline, the VSP is stopped and
    restarted explicitly by the DU from its suspend and resume handlers.
    There is thus no need to stop or restart pipelines in the VSP suspend
    and resume handlers, and doing so would cause the hardware to be
    left in a misconfigured state.
    
    Ensure that the VSP suspend and resume handlers do not affect DRM-based
    pipelines.

    scsi: core: scsi_get_device_flags_keyed(): Always return device flags
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a44c9d36509c83cf64f33b93f6ab2e63822c01eb ]
    
    Since scsi_get_device_flags_keyed() callers do not check whether or not
    the returned value is an error code, change that function such that it
    returns a flags value even if the 'key' argument is invalid.  Note:
    since commit 28a0bc4120d3 ("scsi: sd: Implement blacklist option for
    WRITE SAME w/ UNMAP") bit 31 is a valid device information flag so
    checking whether bit 31 is set in the return value is not sufficient to
    tell the difference between an error code and a flags value.

    [ Upstream commit a8168b6cee6e9334dfebb4b9108e8d73794f6088 ]
    
    On some dual port NICs, the 2 ports have to be configured with compatible
    link speeds.  Under some conditions, a port's configured speed may no
    longer be supported.  The firmware will send a message to the driver
    when this happens.
    
    Improve this logic that prints out the warning by only printing it if
    we can determine the link speed that is no longer supported.  If the
    speed is unknown or it is in autoneg mode, skip the warning message.

    that sun6i_spi_runtime_suspend() is called if needed.

    [ Upstream commit 424ea0d174e82365f85c6770225dba098b8f1d5f ]
    
    It is required to update the teardown state of the peer when
    a tdls link with that peer is terminated. This information is
    useful for the target to perform some cleanups wrt the tdls peer.
    
    Without proper cleanup, target assumes that the peer is connected and
    blocks future connection requests, updating the teardown state of the
    peer addresses the problem.

    If an error occurs when we enable the backup battery charging, we should

    Before commit db43e6c473b5 ("ab8500-bm: Add usb power path support") this
    was the case, but this commit has added some code between the last test and
    the 'out' label.
    So, in case of error, this added code is executed and the error may be
    silently ignored.
    
    Fix it by adding the missing 'goto out', as done in all other error
    handling paths.

    [ Upstream commit bbc3e471011417598e598707486f5d8814ec9c01 ]
    
    When vfs_submount was added the test to limit automounts from
    filesystems that with s_user_ns != &init_user_ns accidentially left
    in follow_automount.  The test was never about any security concerns
    and was always about how do we implement this for filesystems whose
    s_user_ns != &init_user_ns.
    
    At the moment this check makes no difference as there are no
    filesystems that both set FS_USERNS_MOUNT and implement d_automount.
    
    Remove this check now while I am thinking about it so there will not
    be odd booby traps for someone who does want to make this combination
    work.
    
    vfs_submount still needs improvements to allow this combination to work,
    and vfs_submount contains a check that presents a warning.
    
    The autofs4 filesystem could be modified to set FS_USERNS_MOUNT and it would
    need not work on this code path, as userspace performs the mounts.

    [ Upstream commit bccb06c353af3764ca86d9da47652458e6c2eb41 ]
    
    Bufnum mask is used to calculate page position in the internal SRAM.
    
    As IFC version 2.0.0 has 16KB of internal SRAM as compared to older
    versions which had 8KB. Hence bufnum mask needs to be updated.

    mtd: nand: fix interpretation of NAND_CMD_NONE in nand_command[_lp]()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit df467899da0b71465760b4e35127bce837244eee ]
    
    Some drivers (like nand_hynix.c) call ->cmdfunc() with NAND_CMD_NONE
    and a column address and expect the controller to only send address
    cycles. Right now, the default ->cmdfunc() implementations provided by
    the core do not filter out the command cycle in this case and forwards
    the request to the controller driver through the ->cmd_ctrl() method.
    The thing is, NAND controller drivers can get this wrong and send a
    command cycle with a NAND_CMD_NONE opcode and since NAND_CMD_NONE is
    -1, and the command field is usually casted to an u8, we end up sending
    the 0xFF command which is actually a RESET operation.
    
    Add conditions in nand_command[_lp]() functions to sending the initial
    command cycle when command == NAND_CMD_NONE.

    net: xfrm: allow clearing socket xfrm policies.
    
    
    [ Upstream commit be8f8284cd897af2482d4e54fbc2bdfc15557259 ]
    
    Currently it is possible to add or update socket policies, but
    not clear them. Therefore, once a socket policy has been applied,
    the socket cannot be used for unencrypted traffic.
    
    This patch allows (privileged) users to clear socket policies by
    passing in a NULL pointer and zero length argument to the
    {IP,IPV6}_{IPSEC,XFRM}_POLICY setsockopts. This results in both
    the incoming and outgoing policies being cleared.
    
    The simple approach taken in this patch cannot clear socket
    policies in only one direction. If desired this could be added
    in the future, for example by continuing to pass in a length of
    zero (which currently is guaranteed to return EMSGSIZE) and
    making the policy be a pointer to an integer that contains one
    of the XFRM_POLICY_{IN,OUT} enum values.
    
    An alternative would have been to interpret the length as a
    signed integer and use XFRM_POLICY_IN (i.e., 0) to clear the
    input policy and -XFRM_POLICY_OUT (i.e., -1) to clear the output
    policy.

    test_firmware: fix setting old custom fw path back on exit
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 65c79230576873b312c3599479c1e42355c9f349 ]
    
    The file /sys/module/firmware_class/parameters/path can be used
    to set a custom firmware path. The fw_filesystem.sh script creates
    a temporary directory to add a test firmware file to be used during
    testing, in order for this to work it uses the custom path syfs file
    and it was supposed to reset back the file on execution exit. The
    script failed to do this due to a typo, it was using OLD_PATH instead
    of OLD_FWPATH, since its inception since v3.17.
    
    Its not as easy to just keep the old setting, it turns out that
    resetting an empty setting won't actually do what we want, we need
    to check if it was empty and set an empty space.
    
    Without this we end up having the temporary path always set after
    we run these tests.

    This splat cannot be generated by expedited grace periods because they
    always invoke resched_cpu() on the current CPU, which is good because
    expedited grace periods require that resched_cpu() unconditionally
    succeed.  However, other parts of RCU can tolerate resched_cpu() acting
    as a no-op, at least as long as it doesn't happen too often.
    
    This commit therefore makes resched_cpu() invoke resched_curr() only if
    the CPU is either online or is the current CPU.

    But the target task's priority has already been adjusted, so the only
    purpose of switched_to_rt() invoking resched_curr() is to wake up the
    CPU running some task that needs to be preempted by the boosted task.
    But the CPU is offline, which presumably means that the task must be
    migrated to some other CPU, and that this other CPU will undertake any
    needed preemption at the time of migration.  Because the runqueue lock
    is held when resched_curr() is invoked, we know that the boosted task
    cannot go anywhere, so it is not necessary to invoke resched_curr()
    in this particular case.
    
    This commit therefore makes switched_to_rt() refrain from invoking
    resched_curr() when the target CPU is offline.

    iwlwifi: mvm: rs: don't override the rate history in the search cycle
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 992172e3aec19e5b0ea5b757ba40a146b9282d1e ]
    
    When we are in a search cycle, we try different combinations
    of parameters. Those combinations are called 'columns'.
    When we switch to a new column, we first need to check if
    this column has a suitable rate, if not, we can't try it.
    This means we must not erase the statistics we gathered
    for the previous column until we are sure that we are
    indeed switching column.
    
    The code that tries to switch to a new column first sets
    a whole bunch of things for the new column, and only then
    checks that we can find suitable rates in that column.
    While doing that, the code mistakenly erased the rate
    statistics. This code was right until
    struct iwl_scale_tbl_info grew up for TPC.
    
    Fix this to make sure we don't erase the rate statistics
    until we are sure that we can indeed switch to the new
    column.
    
    Note that this bug is really harmless since it causes a
    change in the behavior only when we can't find any rate
    in the new column which should really not happen. In the
    case we do find a suitable we reset the rate statistics
    a few lines later anyway.

    ELO devices have one Button usage in GenDesk field, which makes hid-input map
    it to BTN_LEFT; that confuses userspace, which then considers the device to be

    video/hdmi: Allow "empty" HDMI infoframes
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 593f4b19a094c4426bd1e1e3cbab87a48bd13c71 ]
    
    HDMI 2.0 Appendix F suggest that we should keep sending the infoframe
    when switching from 3D to 2D mode, even if the infoframe isn't strictly
    necessary (ie. not needed to transmit the VIC or stereo information).
    This is a workaround against some sinks that fail to realize that they
    should switch from 3D to 2D mode when the source stop transmitting
    the infoframe.

    drm/edid: set ELD connector type in drm_edid_to_eld()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1d1c36650752b7fb81cee515a9bba4131cac4b7c ]
    
    Since drm_edid_to_eld() knows the connector type, we can set the type in
    ELD while at it. Most connectors this gets called on are not DP
    encoders, and with the HDMI type being 0, this does not change behaviour
    for non-DP.
    
    For i915 having this in place earlier would have saved a considerable
    amount of debugging that lead to the fix 2d8f63297b9f ("drm/i915: always
    update ELD connector type after get modes"). I don't see other drivers,
    even the ones calling drm_edid_to_eld() on DP connectors, setting the
    connector type in ELD.

    perf stat: Fix bug in handling events in error state
    
    
    [ Upstream commit db49a71798a38f3ddf3f3462703328dca39b1ac7 ]
    
    (This is a patch has been sitting in the Intel CQM/CMT driver series for
     a while, despite not depend on it. Sending it now independently since
     the series is being discarded.)
    
    When an event is in error state, read() returns 0 instead of sizeof()
    buffer. In certain modes, such as interval printing, ignoring the 0
    return value may cause bogus count deltas to be computed and thus
    invalid results printed.
    
    This patch fixes this problem by modifying read_counters() to mark the
    event as not scaled (scaled = -1) to force the printout routine to show
    <NOT COUNTED>.

    Bluetooth: 6lowpan: fix delay work init in add_peer_chan()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d2891c4d071d807f01cc911dc42a68f4568d65cf ]
    
    When adding 6lowpan devices very rapidly we sometimes see a crash:
    [23122.306615] CPU: 2 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/2 Not tainted 4.9.0-43-arm64 #1 Debian 4.9.9.linaro.43-1

    This was due to add_peer_chan() unconditionally initializing the
    lowpan_btle_dev->notify_peers delayed work structure, even if the
    lowpan_btle_dev passed into add_peer_chan() had previously been
    initialized.
    
    Normally, this would go unnoticed as the delayed work timer is set for
    100 msec, however when calling add_peer_chan() faster than 100 msec it
    clears out a previously queued delay work causing the crash above.
    
    To fix this, let add_peer_chan() know when a new lowpan_btle_dev is passed
    in so that it only performs the delay work initialization when needed.

    Bluetooth: Avoid bt_accept_unlink() double unlinking
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 27bfbc21a0c0f711fa5382de026c7c0700c9ea28 ]
    
    There is a race condition between a thread calling bt_accept_dequeue()
    and a different thread calling bt_accept_unlink(). Protection against
    concurrency is implemented using sk locking. However, sk locking causes
    serialisation of the bt_accept_dequeue() and bt_accept_unlink() threads.
    This serialisation can cause bt_accept_dequeue() to obtain the sk from the
    parent list but becomes blocked waiting for the sk lock held by the
    bt_accept_unlink() thread. bt_accept_unlink() unlinks sk and this thread
    releases the sk lock unblocking bt_accept_dequeue() which potentially runs
    bt_accept_unlink() again on the same sk causing a crash. The attempt to
    double unlink the same sk from the parent list can cause a NULL pointer
    dereference crash due to bt_sk(sk)->parent becoming NULL on the first
    unlink, followed by the second unlink trying to execute
    bt_sk(sk)->parent->sk_ack_backlog-- in bt_accept_unlink() which crashes.
    
    When sk is in the parent list, bt_sk(sk)->parent will be not be NULL.
    When sk is removed from the parent list, bt_sk(sk)->parent is set to
    NULL. Therefore, add a defensive check for bt_sk(sk)->parent not being
    NULL to ensure that sk is still in the parent list after the sk lock has
    been taken in bt_accept_dequeue(). If bt_sk(sk)->parent is detected as
    being NULL then restart the loop so that the loop variables are refreshed
    to use the latest values. This is necessary as list_for_each_entry_safe()
    is not thread safe so causing a risk of an infinite loop occurring as sk
    could point to itself.
    
    In addition, in bt_accept_dequeue() increase the sk reference count to
    protect against early freeing of sk. Early freeing can be possible if the
    bt_accept_unlink() thread calls l2cap_sock_kill() or rfcomm_sock_kill()
    functions before bt_accept_dequeue() gets the sk lock.
    
    For test purposes, the probability of failure can be increased by putting
    a msleep of 1 second in bt_accept_dequeue() between getting the sk and
    waiting for the sk lock. This exposes the fact that the loop
    list_for_each_entry_safe(p, n, &bt_sk(parent)->accept_q) is not safe from
    threads that unlink sk from the list in parallel with the loop which can
    cause sk to become stale within the loop.

    pwm: tegra: Increase precision in PWM rate calculation
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 250b76f43f57d578ebff5e7211eb2c73aa5cd6ca ]
    
    The rate of the PWM calculated as follows:
    
            hz = NSEC_PER_SEC / period_ns;
            rate = (rate + (hz / 2)) / hz;
    
    This has the precision loss in lower PWM rate.
    
    Change this to have more precision as:
    
            hz = DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST_ULL(NSEC_PER_SEC * 100, period_ns);
            rate = DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(rate * 100, hz)
    
    Example:
    
    1. period_ns = 16672000, PWM clock rate is 200 KHz.
    
            Based on old formula
                    hz = NSEC_PER_SEC / period_ns
                       = 1000000000ul/16672000
                       = 59 (59.98)
                    rate = (200K + 59/2)/59 = 3390
    
            Based on new method:
                    hz = 5998
                    rate = DIV_ROUND_CLOSE(200000*100, 5998) = 3334
    
            If we measure the PWM signal rate, we will get more accurate
            period with rate value of 3334 instead of 3390.
    
    2.  period_ns = 16803898, PWM clock rate is 200 KHz.
    
            Based on old formula:
                    hz = 59, rate = 3390
    
            Based on new formula:

    kprobes/x86: Set kprobes pages read-only
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d0381c81c2f782fa2131178d11e0cfb23d50d631 ]
    
    Set the pages which is used for kprobes' singlestep buffer
    and optprobe's trampoline instruction buffer to readonly.
    This can prevent unexpected (or unintended) instruction
    modification.
    
    This also passes rodata_test as below.
    
    Without this patch, rodata_test shows a warning:
    
      WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at arch/x86/mm/dump_pagetables.c:235 note_page+0x7a9/0xa20

    With this fix, no W+X pages are found:

    kprobes/x86: Fix kprobe-booster not to boost far call instructions
    
    
    [ Upstream commit bd0b90676c30fe640e7ead919b3e38846ac88ab7 ]
    
    Fix the kprobe-booster not to boost far call instruction,
    because a call may store the address in the single-step
    execution buffer to the stack, which should be modified
    after single stepping.
    
    Currently, this instruction will be filtered as not
    boostable in resume_execution(), so this is not a
    critical issue.

    vfio/powerpc/spapr_tce: Enforce IOMMU type compatibility check
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1282ba7fc28dbc66c3f0e4aaafaaa228361d1ae5 ]
    
    The existing SPAPR TCE driver advertises both VFIO_SPAPR_TCE_IOMMU and
    VFIO_SPAPR_TCE_v2_IOMMU types to the userspace and the userspace usually
    picks the v2.
    
    Normally the userspace would create a container, attach an IOMMU group
    to it and only then set the IOMMU type (which would normally be v2).
    
    However a specific IOMMU group may not support v2, in other words
    it may not implement set_window/unset_window/take_ownership/
    release_ownership and such a group should not be attached to
    a v2 container.
    
    This adds extra checks that a new group can do what the selected IOMMU
    type suggests. The userspace can then test the return value from
    ioctl(VFIO_SET_IOMMU, VFIO_SPAPR_TCE_v2_IOMMU) and try
    VFIO_SPAPR_TCE_IOMMU.

    perf inject: Copy events when reordering events in pipe mode
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1e0d4f0200e4dbdfc38d818f329d8a0955f7c6f5 ]
    
    __perf_session__process_pipe_events reuses the same memory buffer to
    process all events in the pipe.
    
    When reordering is needed (e.g. -b option), events are not immediately
    flushed, but kept around until reordering is possible, causing
    memory corruption.
    
    The problem is usually observed by a "Unknown sample error" output. It
    can easily be reproduced by:
    
      perf record -o - noploop | perf inject -b > output
    
    Committer testing:
    
    Before:
    
      $ perf record -o - stress -t 2 -c 2 | perf inject -b > /dev/null
      stress: info: [8297] dispatching hogs: 2 cpu, 0 io, 0 vm, 0 hdd

    drivers/perf: arm_pmu: handle no platform_device
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7654137071fa706e5c91f4f27bc2a5cd7e435a9b ]
    
    In armpmu_dispatch_irq() we look at arm_pmu::plat_device to acquire
    platdata, so that we can defer to platform-specific IRQ handling,
    required on some 32-bit parts. With the advent of ACPI we won't always
    have a platform_device, and so we must avoid trying to dereference
    fields from it.
    
    This patch fixes up armpmu_dispatch_irq() to avoid doing so, introducing
    a new armpmu_get_platdata() helper.

    iwlwifi: mvm: fix RX SKB header size and align it properly
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5cddd05c9cbe420436799716d009bc0372ef8268 ]
    
    When receiving a frame, we currently pull in sizeof(*hdr) plus
    some extra (crypto/snap), which is too much, most headers aren't
    actually sizeof(*hdr) since that takes into account the 4-address
    format but doesn't take into account QoS. As a result, a typical
    frame will have 4 bytes of the payload in the SKB header already.
    
    Fix this by calculating the correct header length, and now that
    we have that, align the end of the SKB header to a multiple of 4
    so that the IP header will be aligned properly when pulled in.

    perf evsel: Return exact sub event which failed with EPERM for wildcards
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 32ccb130f5325abc81b32b1a538390f46e4860f6 ]
    
    The kernel has a special check for a specific irq_vectors trace event.
    
    TRACE_EVENT_PERF_PERM(irq_work_exit,
            is_sampling_event(p_event) ? -EPERM : 0);
    
    The perf-record fails for this irq_vectors event when it is present,
    like when using a wildcard:
    
      root@skl:/tmp# perf record -a -e irq_vectors:* sleep 2
      Error:
      You may not have permission to collect system-wide stats.
    
      Consider tweaking /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid,
      which controls use of the performance events system by
      unprivileged users (without CAP_SYS_ADMIN).
    
      The current value is 2:
    
        -1: Allow use of (almost) all events by all users
      >= 0: Disallow raw tracepoint access by users without CAP_IOC_LOCK
      >= 1: Disallow CPU event access by users without CAP_SYS_ADMIN
      >= 2: Disallow kernel profiling by users without CAP_SYS_ADMIN
    
      To make this setting permanent, edit /etc/sysctl.conf too, e.g.:
    
            kernel.perf_event_paranoid = -1
    
    This patch prints out the exact sub event that failed with EPERM for
    wildcards to help in understanding what went wrong when this event is
    present:
    
    After the patch:
    
      root@skl:/tmp# perf record -a -e irq_vectors:* sleep 2
      Error:
      No permission to enable irq_vectors:irq_work_exit event.
    
      You may not have permission to collect system-wide stats.
      ......

    So we have a lot of irq_vectors events:

    The error message is misleading, this patch will help in pointing out
    what is the event causing such an error, but the error message needs
    improvement, i.e. we need to figure out a way to check if a tracepoint
    is counting only, like this one, when all we can do is to count it with
    'perf stat', at most printing the delta using interval printing, as in:

    usb: dwc2: Make sure we disconnect the gadget state
    
    
    [ Upstream commit dad3f793f20fbb5c0c342f0f5a0bdf69a4d76089 ]
    
    I had seen some odd behavior with HiKey's usb-gadget interface
    that I finally seemed to have chased down. Basically every other
    time I plugged in the OTG port, the gadget interface would
    properly initialize. The other times, I'd get a big WARN_ON
    in dwc2_hsotg_init_fifo() about the fifo_map not being clear.
    
    Ends up if we don't disconnect the gadget state, the fifo-map
    doesn't get cleared properly, which causes WARN_ON messages and
    also results in the device not properly being setup as a gadget
    every other time the OTG port is connected.
    
    So this patch adds a call to dwc2_hsotg_disconnect() in the
    reset path so the state is properly cleared.
    
    With it, the gadget interface initializes properly on every
    plug in.

    md/raid6: Fix anomily when recovering a single device in RAID6.
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7471fb77ce4dc4cb81291189947fcdf621a97987 ]
    
    When recoverying a single missing/failed device in a RAID6,
    those stripes where the Q block is on the missing device are
    handled a bit differently.  In these cases it is easy to
    check that the P block is correct, so we do.  This results
    in the P block be destroy.  Consequently the P block needs
    to be read a second time in order to compute Q.  This causes
    lots of seeks and hurts performance.
    
    It shouldn't be necessary to re-read P as it can be computed
    from the DATA.  But we only compute blocks on missing
    devices, since c337869d9501 ("md: do not compute parity
    unless it is on a failed drive").
    
    So relax the change made in that commit to allow computing
    of the P block in a RAID6 which it is the only missing that
    block.
    
    This makes RAID6 recovery run much faster as the disk just
    "before" the recovering device is no longer seeking
    back-and-forth.

    v4l: vsp1: Prevent multiple streamon race commencing pipeline early
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 4461c84b52b4a952c657505ef7e4e06b016783df ]
    
    With multiple inputs through the BRU it is feasible for the streams to
    race each other at stream-on.
    
    Multiple VIDIOC_STREAMON calls racing each other could have process
    N-1 skipping over the pipeline setup section and then start the pipeline
    early, if videobuf2 has already enqueued buffers to the driver for
    process N but not called the .start_streaming() operation yet
    
    In the case of the video pipelines, this
    can present two serious issues.
    
     1) A null-dereference if the pipe->dl is committed at the same time as
        the vsp1_video_setup_pipeline() is processing
    
     2) A hardware hang, where a display list is committed without having
        called vsp1_video_setup_pipeline() first
    
    Repair this issue, by ensuring that only the stream which configures the
    pipeline is able to start it.

    MIPS: r2-on-r6-emu: Fix BLEZL and BGTZL identification
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5bba7aa4958e271c3ffceb70d47d3206524cf489 ]
    
    Fix the problem of inaccurate identification of instructions BLEZL and
    BGTZL in R2 emulation code by making sure all necessary encoding
    specifications are met.
    
    Previously, certain R6 instructions could be identified as BLEZL or
    BGTZL. R2 emulation routine didn't take into account that both BLEZL
    and BGTZL instructions require their rt field (bits 20 to 16 of
    instruction encoding) to be 0, and that, at same time, if the value in
    that field is not 0, the encoding may represent a legitimate MIPS R6
    instruction.
    
    This means that a problem could occur after emulation optimization,
    when emulation routine tried to pipeline emulation, picked up a next
    candidate, and subsequently misrecognized an R6 instruction as BLEZL
    or BGTZL.
    
    It should be said that for single pass strategy, the problem does not
    happen because CPU doesn't trap on branch-compacts which share opcode
    space with BLEZL/BGTZL (but have rt field != 0, of course).

    [ Upstream commit e61c38d85b7392e033ee03bca46f1d6006156175 ]
    
    If the UART is operated in DTE mode and UCR3_DCD or UCR3_RI are 1 (which
    is the reset default) and the opposite side pulls the respective line to
    its active level the irq triggers after it is requested in .probe.
    
    These irqs were already disabled in .startup but this might be too late.
    
    Also setup of the UFCR_DCEDTE bit (currently done in .set_termios) is
    done very late which is critical as it also controls direction of some
    pins.
    
    So setup UFCR_DCEDTE earlier (in .probe) and also disable the broken
    irqs in DTE mode there before requesting irqs.

    tty: amba-pl011: Fix spurious TX interrupts
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7d05587c9e0e4611650bb403812e2d492c178a9f ]
    
    On SMP systems, we see a lot of spurious TX interrupts when a
    program generates a steady stream of output to the pl011 UART.
    
    The problem can be easily seen when one CPU generates the output
    while another CPU handles the pl011 interrupts, and the rate of
    output is low enough not to fill the TX FIFO. The problem seems
    to be:
    
        -- CPU a --                        -- CPU b --
       (take port lock)
       pl011_start_tx
          pl011_start_tx_pio
             enable TXIM in REG_IMSC   ->  causes uart tx intr (pl011_int)
             pl011_tx_chars                pl011_int
                ...tx chars, all done...       (wait for port lock)
                pl011_stop_tx                   .
                   disable TXIM                 .
        (release port lock)            ->      (take port lock)
                                               check for TXIM, not enabled
                                               (release port lock)
                                               return IRQ_NONE
    
    Enabling the TXIM in pl011_start_tx_pio() causes the interrupt
    to be generated and delivered to CPU b, even though pl011_tx_chars()
    is able to complete the TX and then disable the tx interrupt.
    
    Fix this by enabling TXIM only after pl011_tx_chars, if it is needed.
    pl011_tx_chars will return a boolean indicating whether the TX
    interrupts have to be enabled.

    lkdtm: turn off kcov for lkdtm_rodata_do_nothing:
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7064dc7fc13b2994d33ae540ffb7a3a05ac463bf ]
    
    I ran into a link error on ARM64 for lkdtm_rodata_do_nothing:
    
    drivers/misc/built-in.o: In function `lkdtm_rodata_do_nothing':
    :(.rodata+0x68c8): relocation truncated to fit: R_AARCH64_CALL26 against symbol `__sanitizer_cov_trace_pc' defined in .text section in kernel/built-in.o
    
    I did not analyze this further, but my theory is that we would need a trampoline
    to call __sanitizer_cov_trace_pc(), but the linker (correctly) only adds trampolines
    for callers in executable sections.
    
    Disabling KCOV for this one file avoids the build failure with no
    other practical downsides I can think of.
    
    The problem can only happen on kernels that contain both kcov and
    lkdtm, so if we want to backport this, it should be in the earliest
    version that has both (v4.8).

    Normally it should be enabled by the bootloader, but there's no

    cause the device to hang.
    
    And this patch also does these:
    1/ move vop_initial to the end of vop_bind for eaiser error handling.
    2/ correct the err_put_pm_runtime of vop_enable.

    kvm: nVMX: Disallow userspace-injected exceptions in guest mode
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 28d06353881939703c34d82a1465136af176c620 ]
    
    The userspace exception injection API and code path are entirely
    unprepared for exceptions that might cause a VM-exit from L2 to L1, so
    the best course of action may be to simply disallow this for now.
    
    1. The API provides no mechanism for userspace to specify the new DR6
    bits for a #DB exception or the new CR2 value for a #PF
    exception. Presumably, userspace is expected to modify these registers
    directly with KVM_SET_SREGS before the next KVM_RUN ioctl. However, in
    the event that L1 intercepts the exception, these registers should not
    be changed. Instead, the new values should be provided in the
    exit_qualification field of vmcs12 (Intel SDM vol 3, section 27.1).
    
    2. In the case of a userspace-injected #DB, inject_pending_event()
    clears DR7.GD before calling vmx_queue_exception(). However, in the
    event that L1 intercepts the exception, this is too early, because
    DR7.GD should not be modified by a #DB that causes a VM-exit directly
    (Intel SDM vol 3, section 27.1).
    
    3. If the injected exception is a #PF, nested_vmx_check_exception()
    doesn't properly check whether or not L1 is interested in the
    associated error code (using the #PF error code mask and match fields
    from vmcs12). It may either return 0 when it should call
    nested_vmx_vmexit() or vice versa.
    
    4. nested_vmx_check_exception() assumes that it is dealing with a
    hardware-generated exception intercept from L2, with some of the
    relevant details (the VM-exit interruption-information and the exit
    qualification) live in vmcs02. For userspace-injected exceptions, this
    is not the case.
    
    5. prepare_vmcs12() assumes that when its exit_intr_info argument
    specifies valid information with a valid error code that it can VMREAD
    the VM-exit interruption error code from vmcs02. For
    userspace-injected exceptions, this is not the case.

    up the reserved bits in order not to confuse guests.

    iommu/iova: Fix underflow bug in __alloc_and_insert_iova_range
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5016bdb796b3726eec043ca0ce3be981f712c756 ]
    
    Normally, calling alloc_iova() using an iova_domain with insufficient
    pfns remaining between start_pfn and dma_limit will fail and return a
    NULL pointer. Unexpectedly, if such a "full" iova_domain contains an
    iova with pfn_lo == 0, the alloc_iova() call will instead succeed and
    return an iova containing invalid pfns.
    
    This is caused by an underflow bug in __alloc_and_insert_iova_range()
    that occurs after walking the "full" iova tree when the search ends
    at the iova with pfn_lo == 0 and limit_pfn is then adjusted to be just
    below that (-1). This (now huge) limit_pfn gives the impression that a
    vast amount of space is available between it and start_pfn and thus
    a new iova is allocated with the invalid pfn_hi value, 0xFFF.... .
    
    To rememdy this, a check is introduced to ensure that adjustments to
    limit_pfn will not underflow.
    
    This issue has been observed in the wild, and is easily reproduced with
    the following sample code.
    
            struct iova_domain *iovad = kzalloc(sizeof(*iovad), GFP_KERNEL);
            struct iova *rsvd_iova, *good_iova, *bad_iova;
            unsigned long limit_pfn = 3;
            unsigned long start_pfn = 1;
            unsigned long va_size = 2;
    
            init_iova_domain(iovad, SZ_4K, start_pfn, limit_pfn);
            rsvd_iova = reserve_iova(iovad, 0, 0);
            good_iova = alloc_iova(iovad, va_size, limit_pfn, true);
            bad_iova = alloc_iova(iovad, va_size, limit_pfn, true);
    
    Prior to the patch, this yielded:
            *rsvd_iova == {0, 0}   /* Expected */
            *good_iova == {2, 3}   /* Expected */
            *bad_iova  == {-2, -1} /* Oh no... */
    
    After the patch, bad_iova is NULL as expected since inadequate
    space remains between limit_pfn and start_pfn after allocating
    good_iova.

    qed: Correct MSI-x for storage
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 2f78227874754b1e10cd348fd6e7693b0dabb3f6 ]
    
    When qedr is enabled, qed would try dividing the msi-x vectors between
    L2 and RoCE, starting with L2 and providing it with sufficient vectors
    for its queues.
    
    Problem is qed would also do that for storage partitions, and as those
    don't need queues it would lead qed to award those partitions with 0
    msi-x vectors, causing them to believe theye're using INTa and
    preventing them from operating.

    scsi: ses: don't get power status of SES device slot on probe
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 75106523f39751390b5789b36ee1d213b3af1945 ]
    
    The commit 08024885a2a3 ("ses: Add power_status to SES device slot")
    introduced the 'power_status' attribute to enclosure components and
    the associated callbacks.
    
    There are 2 callbacks available to get the power status of a device:
    1) ses_get_power_status() for 'struct enclosure_component_callbacks'
    2) get_component_power_status() for the sysfs device attribute
    (these are available for kernel-space and user-space, respectively.)
    
    However, despite both methods being available to get power status
    on demand, that commit also introduced a call to get power status
    in ses_enclosure_data_process().
    
    This dramatically increased the total probe time for SCSI devices
    on larger configurations, because ses_enclosure_data_process() is
    called several times during the SCSI devices probe and loops over
    the component devices (but that is another problem, another patch).
    
    That results in a tremendous continuous hammering of SCSI Receive
    Diagnostics commands to the enclosure-services device, which does
    delay the total probe time for the SCSI devices __significantly__:
    
      Originally, ~34 minutes on a system attached to ~170 disks:
    
        [ 9214.490703] mpt3sas version 13.100.00.00 loaded

        [11256.580231] scsi 17:0:177:0: qdepth(16), tagged(1), simple(0),
                       ordered(0), scsi_level(6), cmd_que(1)
    
      With this patch, it decreased to ~2.5 minutes -- a 13.6x faster
    
        [ 1002.992533] mpt3sas version 13.100.00.00 loaded
        ...
        [ 1151.978831] scsi 11:0:177:0: qdepth(16), tagged(1), simple(0),
                       ordered(0), scsi_level(6), cmd_que(1)
    
    Back to the commit discussion.. on the ses_get_power_status() call
    introduced in ses_enclosure_data_process(): impact of removing it.
    
    That may possibly be in place to initialize the power status value
    on device probe.  However, those 2 functions available to retrieve
    that value _do_ automatically refresh/update it.  So the potential
    benefit would be a direct access of the 'power_status' field which
    does not use the callbacks...
    
    But the only reader of 'struct enclosure_component::power_status'
    is the get_component_power_status() callback for sysfs attribute,
    and it _does_ check for and call the .get_power_status callback,
    (which indeed is defined and implemented by that commit), so the
    power status value is, again, automatically updated.
    
    So, the remaining potential for a direct/non-callback access to
    the power_status attribute would be out-of-tree modules -- well,
    for those, if they are for whatever reason interested in values
    that are set during device probe and not up-to-date by the time
    they need it.. well, that would be curious.
    
    Well, to handle that more properly, set the initial power state
    value to '-1' (i.e., uninitialized) instead of '1' (power 'on'),
    and check for it in that callback which may do an direct access
    to the field value _if_ a callback function is not defined.

    ALSA: firewire-digi00x: handle all MIDI messages on streaming packets
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 8820a4cf0cb4cd5c6540a9a18b2cedbdfd5a6891 ]
    
    At a commit 9dc5d31cdceb ("ALSA: firewire-digi00x: handle MIDI messages in
    isochronous packets"), a functionality to handle MIDI messages on
    isochronous packet was supported. But this includes some of my
    misunderstanding. This commit is to fix them.
    
    For digi00x series, first data channel of data blocks in rx/tx packet
    includes MIDI messages. The data channel has 0x80 in 8 bit of its MSB,
    however it's against IEC 61883-6. Unique data format is applied:
     - Upper 4 bits of LSB represent port number.
      - 0x0: port 1.
      - 0x2: port 2.
      - 0xe: console port.
     - Lower 4 bits of LSB represent the number of included MIDI message bytes;
       0x0/0x1/0x2.
     - Two bytes of middle of this data channel have MIDI bytes.
    
    Especially, MIDI messages from/to console surface are also transferred by
    isochronous packets, as well as physical MIDI ports.

    ALSA: firewire-digi00x: add support for console models of Digi00x series
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 13e005f9f933a35b5e55c9d36f151efe2a8383ec ]
    
    Digi00x series includes two types of unit; rack and console. As long as
    reading information on config rom of Digi 002 console, 'MODEL_ID' field
    has a different value from the one on Digi 002 rack.
    
    We've already got a test report from users with Digi 003 rack. We can
    assume that console type and rack type has different value in the field.
    
    This commit adds a device entry for console type. For following commits,
    this commit also adds a member to 'struct snd_digi00x' to identify console
    type.

    ASoC: rt5677: Add OF device ID table
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7b87463edf3e2c16d72eeea3d1cf3c12bb5487c6 ]
    
    The driver doesn't have a struct of_device_id table but supported devices
    are registered via Device Trees. This is working on the assumption that a
    I2C device registered via OF will always match a legacy I2C device ID and
    that the MODALIAS reported will always be of the form i2c:<device>.
    
    But this could change in the future so the correct approach is to have an
    OF device ID table if the devices are registered via OF.

    reiserfs: Make cancel_old_flush() reliable
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 71b0576bdb862e964a82c73327cdd1a249c53e67 ]
    
    Currently canceling of delayed work that flushes old data using
    cancel_old_flush() does not prevent work from being requeued. Thus
    in theory new work can be queued after cancel_old_flush() from
    reiserfs_freeze() has run. This will become larger problem once
    flush_old_commits() can requeue the work itself.
    
    Fix the problem by recording in sbi->work_queue that flushing work is
    canceled and should not be requeued.

    printk: Correctly handle preemption in console_unlock()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 257ab443118bffc7fdcef38f49cf59be68a3e362 ]
    
    Some console drivers code calls console_conditional_schedule()
    that looks at @console_may_schedule. The value must be cleared
    when the drivers are called from console_unlock() with
    interrupts disabled. But rescheduling is fine when the same
    code is called, for example, from tty operations where the
    console semaphore is taken via console_lock().
    
    This is why @console_may_schedule is cleared before calling console
    drivers. The original value is stored to decide if we could sleep
    between lines.
    
    Now, @console_may_schedule is not cleared when we call
    console_trylock() and jump back to the "again" goto label.
    This has become a problem, since the commit 6b97a20d3a7909daa066
    ("printk: set may_schedule for some of console_trylock() callers").
    @console_may_schedule might get enabled now.
    
    There is also the opposite problem. console_lock() can be called
    only from preemptive context. It can always enable scheduling in
    the console code. But console_trylock() is not able to detect it
    when CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT is disabled. Therefore we should use the
    original @console_may_schedule value after re-acquiring
    the console semaphore in console_unlock().
    
    This patch solves both problems by moving the "again" goto label.
    
    Alternative solution was to clear and restore the value around
    call_console_drivers(). Then console_conditional_schedule() could
    be used also inside console_unlock(). But there was a potential race
    with console_flush_on_panic() as reported by Sergey Senozhatsky.
    That function should be called only where there is only one CPU
    and with interrupts disabled. But better be on the safe side
    because stopping CPUs might fail.
    
    Fixes: 6b97a20d3a7909 ("printk: set may_schedule for some of console_trylock() callers")

    rtmutex: Fix PI chain order integrity
    
    
    [ Upstream commit e0aad5b44ff5d28ac1d6ae70cdf84ca228e889dc ]
    
    rt_mutex_waiter::prio is a copy of task_struct::prio which is updated
    during the PI chain walk, such that the PI chain order isn't messed up
    by (asynchronous) task state updates.
    
    Currently rt_mutex_waiter_less() uses task state for deadline tasks;
    this is broken, since the task state can, as said above, change
    asynchronously, causing the RB tree order to change without actual
    tree update -> FAIL.
    
    Fix this by also copying the deadline into the rt_mutex_waiter state
    and updating it along with its prio field.
    
    Ideally we would also force PI chain updates whenever DL tasks update
    their deadline parameter, but for first approximation this is less
    broken than it was.

    powerpc: Avoid taking a data miss on every userspace instruction miss
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a7a9dcd882a67b68568868b988289fce5ffd8419 ]
    
    Early on in do_page_fault() we call store_updates_sp(), regardless of
    the type of exception. For an instruction miss this doesn't make
    sense, because we only use this information to detect if a data miss
    is the result of a stack expansion instruction or not.
    
    Worse still, it results in a data miss within every userspace
    instruction miss handler, because we try and load the very instruction
    we are about to install a pte for!
    
    A simple exec microbenchmark runs 6% faster on POWER8 with this fix:
    
     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
    
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
            unsigned long left = atol(argv[1]);
            char leftstr[16];
    
            if (left-- == 0)
                    return 0;
    
            sprintf(leftstr, "%ld", left);
            execlp(argv[0], argv[0], leftstr, NULL);
            perror("exec failed\n");
    
            return 0;
    }
    
    Pass the number of iterations on the command line (eg 10000) and time
    how long it takes to execute.

    NFC: nfcmrvl: Include unaligned.h instead of access_ok.h
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d916d923724d59cde99ee588f15eec59dd863bbd ]
    
    Including linux/unaligned/access_ok.h causes the allmodconfig build on
    ia64 (and maybe others) to fail with the following warnings:

    vxlan: vxlan dev should inherit lowerdev's gso_max_size
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d6acfeb17d030bb3907e77c048b0e7783ad8e5a9 ]
    
    vxlan dev currently ignores lowerdev's gso_max_size, which adversely
    affects TSO performance of liquidio if it's the lowerdev.  Egress TCP
    packets' skb->len often exceed liquidio's advertised gso_max_size.  This
    may happen on other NIC drivers.
    
    Fix it by assigning lowerdev's gso_max_size to that of vxlan dev.  Might as
    well do likewise for gso_max_segs.
    
    Single flow TSO throughput of liquidio as lowerdev (using iperf3):

    commit bbeddf52adc1 ("printk: move braille console support into

    to outline the braille initialization code.  There was however some
    confusion over the value it was supposed to return. commit 2cfe6c4ac7ee

    This fixes and documents the returned value according to the use
    in printk.c: non-zero return means a parsing error, and thus this

    bonding: refine bond_fold_stats() wrap detection
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 142c6594acbcc32391af9c15f8cd65c6c177698f ]
    
    Some device drivers reset their stats at down/up events, possibly
    fooling bonding stats, since they operate with relative deltas.
    
    It is nearly not possible to fix drivers, since some of them compute the
    tx/rx counters based on per rx/tx queue stats, and the queues can be
    reconfigured (ethtool -L) between the down/up sequence.
    
    Lets avoid accumulating 'negative' values that render bonding stats
    useless.
    
    It is better to lose small deltas, assuming the bonding stats are
    fetched at a reasonable frequency.

    drm/ttm: never add BO that failed to validate to the LRU list
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c2c139cf435b18939204800fa72c53a7207bdd68 ]
    
    Fixes a potential race condition in amdgpu that looks as follows:
    
    Task 1: attempt ttm_bo_init, but ttm_bo_validate fails
    Task 1: add BO to global list anyway
    Task 2: grabs hold of the BO, waits on its reservation lock
    Task 1: releases its reference of the BO; never gives up the
            reservation lock
    
    The patch "drm/amdgpu: fix a potential deadlock in
    amdgpu_bo_create_restricted()" attempts to fix that by releasing
    the reservation lock in amdgpu code; unfortunately, it introduces
    a use-after-free when this race _doesn't_ happen.
    
    This patch should fix the race properly by never adding the BO
    to the global list in the first place.

    Which may happen when we start a tracing session and a thread is waiting
    for something like "poll" to return, in which case we better print "?"
    both for the syscall entry timestamp and for the duration.
    
    E.g.:
    
    Tracing existing mutt session:
    
      # perf trace -p `pidof mutt`
              ? (     ?   ): mutt/17135  ... [continued]: poll()) = 1
          0.027 ( 0.013 ms): mutt/17135 read(buf: 0x7ffcb3c42cef, count: 1) = 1
          0.047 ( 0.008 ms): mutt/17135 poll(ufds: 0x7ffcb3c42c50, nfds: 1, timeout_msecs: 1000) = 1
          0.059 ( 0.008 ms): mutt/17135 read(buf: 0x7ffcb3c42cef, count: 1) = 1
      <SNIP>
    
    Before it would print a large number because we'd do:
    
      ttrace->entry_time - trace->base_time
    
    And entry_time would be 0, while base_time would be the timestamp for
    the first event 'perf trace' reads, oops.

    count and list for regulators that don't provide this information

    a side effect normal continuous regulators can leak details of their
    supplies and provide consumers with inconsistent information.
    
    Limit the propagation of the voltage count and list to switch
    regulators.

    blk-throttle: make sure expire time isn't too big
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 06cceedcca67a93ac7f7aa93bbd9980c7496d14e ]
    
    cgroup could be throttled to a limit but when all cgroups cross high
    limit, queue enters a higher state and so the group should be throttled
    to a higher limit. It's possible the cgroup is sleeping because of
    throttle and other cgroups don't dispatch IO any more. In this case,
    nobody can trigger current downgrade/upgrade logic. To fix this issue,
    we could either set up a timer to wakeup the cgroup if other cgroups are
    idle or make sure this cgroup doesn't sleep too long. Setting up a timer
    means we must change the timer very frequently. This patch chooses the
    latter. Making cgroup sleep time not too big wouldn't change cgroup
    bps/iops, but could make it wakeup more frequently, which isn't a big
    issue because throtl_slice * 8 is already quite big.

    ALSA: firewire-lib: add a quirk of packet without valid EOH in CIP format
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 2128f78f75a36a34dfef0e127273c2f820c5c904 ]
    
    In IEC 61883-1, when two quadlets CIP header is used, the most significant
    bit in second CIP header stands. However, packets from units with MOTU
    protocol version 3 have a quirk without this flag. Current packet streaming
    layer handles this as protocol error.
    
    This commit adds a new enumeration constant for this quirk, to handle MOTU
    protocol version 3.

    bonding: make speed, duplex setting consistent with link state
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c4adfc822bf5d8e97660b6114b5a8892530ce8cb ]
    
    bond_update_speed_duplex() retrieves speed and duplex settings. There
    is a possibility of failure in retrieving these values but caller has
    to assume it's always successful. This leads to having inconsistent
    slave link settings. If these (speed, duplex) values cannot be
    retrieved, then keeping the link UP causes problems.
    
    The updated bond_update_speed_duplex() returns 0 on success if it
    retrieves sane values for speed and duplex. On failure it returns 1
    and marks the link down.

    perf annotate: Fix a bug following symbolic link of a build-id file
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ebd2547dd24daf95a21b2bc59931de8502afcc3 ]
    
    It is wrong way to read link name from a build-id file.  Because a
    build-id file is not anymore a symbolic link but build-id directory of
    it is symbolic link, so fix it.
    
    For example, if build-id file name gotten from
    dso__build_id_filename() is as below,
    
      /root/.debug/.build-id/4f/75c7d197c951659d1c1b8b5fd49bcdf8f3f8b1/elf
    
    To correctly read link name of build-id, use the build-id dir path that
    is a symbolic link, instead of the above build-id file name like below.
    
      /root/.debug/.build-id/4f/75c7d197c951659d1c1b8b5fd49bcdf8f3f8b1

    dmaengine: imx-sdma: add 1ms delay to ensure SDMA channel is stopped
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7f3ff14b7eb1ffad132117f08a1973b48e653d43 ]
    
    sdma_disable_channel() cannot ensure dma is stopped to access
    module's FIFOs. There is chance SDMA core is running and accessing
    BD when disable of corresponding channel, this may cause sometimes
    even after call of .sdma_disable_channel(), SDMA core still be
    running and accessing module's FIFOs.
    
    According to NXP R&D team a delay of one BD SDMA cost time (maximum
    is 1ms) should be added after disable of the channel bit, to ensure
    SDMA core has really been stopped after SDMA clients call
    .device_terminate_all.
    
    This patch introduces adds a new function sdma_disable_channel_with_delay()
    which simply adds 1ms delay after call sdma_disable_channel(),
    and set it as .device_terminate_all.

    tcp: sysctl: Fix a race to avoid unexpected 0 window from space
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c48367427a39ea0b85c7cf018fe4256627abfd9e ]
    
    Because sysctl_tcp_adv_win_scale could be changed any time, so there
    is one race in tcp_win_from_space.
    For example,
    1.sysctl_tcp_adv_win_scale<=0 (sysctl_tcp_adv_win_scale is negative now)
    2.space>>(-sysctl_tcp_adv_win_scale) (sysctl_tcp_adv_win_scale is postive now)
    
    As a result, tcp_win_from_space returns 0. It is unexpected.
    
    Certainly if the compiler put the sysctl_tcp_adv_win_scale into one
    register firstly, then use the register directly, it would be ok.
    But we could not depend on the compiler behavior.

    spi: omap2-mcspi: poll OMAP2_MCSPI_CHSTAT_RXS for PIO transfer
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 812613591cb652344186c4cd912304ed02138566 ]
    
    When running the spi-loopback-test with slower clock rate like 10 KHz,
    the test for 251 bytes transfer was failed.  This failure triggered an
    spi-omap2-mcspi's error message "DMA RX last word empty".
    
    This message means that PIO for reading the remaining bytes due to the
    DMA transfer length reduction is failed.  This problem can be fixed by
    polling OMAP2_MCSPI_CHSTAT_RXS bit in channel status register to wait
    until the receive buffer register is filled.

    ASoC: rcar: ssi: don't set SSICR.CKDV = 000 with SSIWSR.CONT
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6b8530cc056efd4a11b034ca5b1e9f7e9563f553 ]
    
    R-Car Datasheet is indicating "SSICR.CKDV = 000 is invalid when
    SSIWSR.WS_MODE = 1 or SSIWSR.CONT = 1".
    Current driver will set CONT, thus, we shouldn't use CKDV = 000.
    This patch fixup it.

    PCI: hv: Lock PCI bus on device eject
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 414428c5da1c71986727c2fa5cdf1ed071e398d7 ]
    
    A PCI_EJECT message can arrive at the same time we are calling
    pci_scan_child_bus() in the workqueue for the previous PCI_BUS_RELATIONS
    message or in create_root_hv_pci_bus().  In this case we could potentially
    modify the bus from multiple places.
    
    Properly lock the bus access.

    PCI: hv: Properly handle PCI bus remove
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d3a78d8bf759d8848339dcc367c4c1678b57a08b ]
    
    hv_pci_devices_present() is called in hv_pci_remove() when we remove a PCI
    device from the host, e.g., by disabling SR-IOV on a device.  In
    hv_pci_remove(), the bus is already removed before the call, so we don't
    need to rescan the bus in the workqueue scheduled from
    hv_pci_devices_present().
    
    By introducing bus state hv_pcibus_removed, we can avoid this situation.

    sched: act_csum: don't mangle TCP and UDP GSO packets
    
    
    [ Upstream commit add641e7dee31b36aee83412c29e39dd1f5e0c9c ]
    
    after act_csum computes the checksum on skbs carrying GSO TCP/UDP packets,
    subsequent segmentation fails because skb_needs_check(skb, true) returns
    true. Because of that, skb_warn_bad_offload() is invoked and the following
    message is displayed:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 28 at net/core/dev.c:2553 skb_warn_bad_offload+0xf0/0xfd

    Since GSO is able to compute checksum on individual segments of such skbs,
    we can simply skip mangling the packet.

    Input: qt1070 - add OF device ID table
    
    
    [ Upstream commit cf5cd9d4480a87da78768718cac194a71079b5cb ]
    
    The driver doesn't have a struct of_device_id table but supported devices
    are registered via Device Trees. This is working on the assumption that a
    I2C device registered via OF will always match a legacy I2C device ID and
    that the MODALIAS reported will always be of the form i2c:<device>.
    
    But this could change in the future so the correct approach is to have an
    OF device ID table if the devices are registered via OF.
    
    The compatible strings don't have a vendor prefix because that's how it's
    used currently, and changing this will be a Device Tree ABI break.

    sysrq: Reset the watchdog timers while displaying high-resolution timers
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 0107042768658fea9f5f5a9c00b1c90f5dab6a06 ]
    
    On systems with a large number of CPUs, running sysrq-<q> can cause
    watchdog timeouts.  There are two slow sections of code in the sysrq-<q>
    path in timer_list.c.
    
    1. print_active_timers() - This function is called by print_cpu() and
       contains a slow goto loop.  On a machine with hundreds of CPUs, this
       loop took approximately 100ms for the first CPU in a NUMA node.
       (Subsequent CPUs in the same node ran much quicker.)  The total time
       to print all of the CPUs is ultimately long enough to trigger the
       soft lockup watchdog.
    
    2. print_tickdevice() - This function outputs a large amount of textual
       information.  This function also took approximately 100ms per CPU.
    
    Since sysrq-<q> is not a performance critical path, there should be no
    harm in touching the nmi watchdog in both slow sections above.  Touching
    it in just one location was insufficient on systems with hundreds of
    CPUs as occasional timeouts were still observed during testing.
    
    This issue was observed on an Oracle T7 machine with 128 CPUs, but I
    anticipate it may affect other systems with similarly large numbers of
    CPUs.

    timers, sched_clock: Update timeout for clock wrap
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1b8955bc5ac575009835e371ae55e7f3af2197a9 ]
    
    The scheduler clock framework may not use the correct timeout for the clock
    wrap. This happens when a new clock driver calls sched_clock_register()
    after the kernel called sched_clock_postinit(). In this case the clock wrap
    timeout is too long thus sched_clock_poll() is called too late and the clock
    already wrapped.
    
    On my ARM system the scheduler was no longer scheduling any other task than
    the idle task because the sched_clock() wrapped.

    '[media] V4L: add CCF support to the v4l2_clk API', ov6650 sensor
    stopped responding because v4l2_clk_get(), still called with
    depreciated V4L2 clock name "mclk", started to return respective CCF
    clock instead of the V4l2 one registered by soc_camera. Fix it by
    calling v4l2_clk_get() with NULL clock name.

    the commands getting aborted to get sent back from the adapter prior to
    returning from the EH handler. This fixes up some cases where the
    completion handler was not getting called, which would have resulted in
    the EH thread waiting until it timed out, greatly extending EH time.

    x86/boot/32: Defer resyncing initial_page_table until per-cpu is set up
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 23b2a4ddebdd17fad265b4bb77256c2e4ec37dee ]
    
    The x86 smpboot trampoline expects initial_page_table to have the
    GDT mapped.  If the GDT ends up in a virtually mapped per-cpu page,
    then it won't be in the page tables at all until perc-pu areas are
    set up.  The result will be a triple fault the first time that the
    CPU attempts to access the GDT after LGDT loads the perc-pu GDT.
    
    This appears to be an old bug, but somehow the GDT fixmap rework
    is triggering it.  This seems to have something to do with the
    memory layout.

    will cause an error. Fix this to return the truncated length. If an error
    in the case was desired, then then we should just return -ENOMEM.
    
    The reality is no device will ever have 4KB of compatible strings to hit
    this case.

    batman-adv: handle race condition for claims between gateways
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a3a5129e122709306cfa6409781716c2933df99b ]
    
    Consider the following situation which has been found in a test setup:
    Gateway B has claimed client C and gateway A has the same backbone
    network as B. C sends a broad- or multicast to B and directly after
    this packet decides to send another packet to A due to a better TQ
    value. B will forward the broad-/multicast into the backbone as it is
    the responsible gw and after that A will claim C as it has been
    chosen by C as the best gateway. If it now happens that A claims C
    before it has received the broad-/multicast forwarded by B (due to
    backbone topology or due to some delay in B when forwarding the
    packet) we get a critical situation: in the current code A will
    immediately unclaim C when receiving the multicast due to the
    roaming client scenario although the position of C has not changed
    in the mesh. If this happens the multi-/broadcast forwarded by B
    will be sent back into the mesh by A and we have looping packets
    until one of the gateways claims C again.
    In order to prevent this, unclaiming of a client due to the roaming
    client scenario is only done after a certain time is expired after
    the last claim of the client. 100 ms are used here, which should be
    slow enough for big backbones and slow gateways but fast enough not
    to break the roaming client use case.

    The moxart interrupt line flags were not respected in previous

    was set in the controller.
    
    With the migration to a standard Faraday driver we need to
    set up and handle the consumer flags correctly. Also remove
    the Moxart-specific flags when switching to using real consumer
    flags.
    
    Extend the register window to 0x100 bytes as we may have a few
    more registers in there and it doesn't hurt.

    net/8021q: create device with all possible features in wanted_features
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 88997e4208aea117627898e5f6f9801cf3cd42d2 ]
    
    wanted_features is a set of features which have to be enabled if a
    hardware allows that.
    
    Currently when a vlan device is created, its wanted_features is set to
    current features of its base device.
    
    The problem is that the base device can get new features and they are
    not propagated to vlan-s of this device.
    
    If we look at bonding devices, they doesn't have this problem and this
    patch suggests to fix this issue by the same way how it works for bonding
    devices.
    
    We meet this problem, when we try to create a vlan device over a bonding
    device. When a system are booting, real devices require time to be
    initialized, so bonding devices created without slaves, then vlan
    devices are created and only then ethernet devices are added to the
    bonding device. As a result we have vlan devices with disabled
    scatter-gather.
    
    * create a bonding device
      $ ip link add bond0 type bond
      $ ethtool -k bond0 | grep scatter
      scatter-gather: off
            tx-scatter-gather: off [requested on]
            tx-scatter-gather-fraglist: off [requested on]
    
    * create a vlan device
      $ ip link add link bond0 name bond0.10 type vlan id 10
      $ ethtool -k bond0.10 | grep scatter
      scatter-gather: off
            tx-scatter-gather: off
            tx-scatter-gather-fraglist: off
    
    * Add a slave device to bond0
      $ ip link set dev eth0 master bond0
    
    And now we can see that the bond0 device has got the scatter-gather
    feature, but the bond0.10 hasn't got it.
    [root@laptop linux-task-diag]# ethtool -k bond0 | grep scatter
    scatter-gather: on
            tx-scatter-gather: on
            tx-scatter-gather-fraglist: on
    [root@laptop linux-task-diag]# ethtool -k bond0.10 | grep scatter
    scatter-gather: off
            tx-scatter-gather: off
            tx-scatter-gather-fraglist: off
    
    With this patch the vlan device will get all new features from the
    bonding device.
    
    Here is a call trace how features which are set in this patch reach
    dev->wanted_features.
    
    register_netdevice
       vlan_dev_init
            ...
            dev->hw_features = NETIF_F_HW_CSUM | NETIF_F_SG |

                           NETIF_F_ALL_FCOE;
    
            dev->features |= dev->hw_features;
            ...

    HID: clamp input to logical range if no null state
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c3883fe06488a483658ba5d849b70e49bee15e7c ]
    
    This patch fixes an issue in drivers/hid/hid-input.c where values
    outside of the logical range are not clamped when "null state" bit of
    the input control is not set.
    
    This was discussed on the lists [1] and this change stems from the fact
    due to the ambiguity of the HID specification it might be appropriate to
    follow Microsoft's own interpretation of the specification. As noted in
    Microsoft's documentation [2] in the section titled "Required HID usages
    for digitizers" it is noted that values reported outside the logical
    range "will be considered as invalid data and the value will be changed
    to the nearest boundary value (logical min/max)."
    
    This patch fixes an issue where the (1292:4745) Innomedia INNEX
    GENESIS/ATARI reports out of range values for its X and Y axis of the
    DPad which, due to the null state bit being unset, are forwarded to
    userspace as is. Now these values will get clamped to the logical range
    before being forwarded to userspace. This device was also used to test
    this patch.
    
    This patch expands on commit 3f3752705dbd ("HID: reject input outside
    logical range only if null state is set").

    perf probe: Return errno when not hitting any event
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 70946723eeb859466f026274b29c6196e39149c4 ]
    
    On old perf, when using 'perf probe -d' to delete an inexistent event,
    it returns errno, eg,
    
      -bash-4.3# perf probe -d xxx  || echo $?
      Info: Event "*:xxx" does not exist.
        Error: Failed to delete events.
      255
    
    But now perf_del_probe_events() will always set ret = 0, different from
    previous del_perf_probe_events(). After this, it returns errno again,
    eg,
    
      -bash-4.3# ./perf probe -d xxx  || echo $?
      "xxx" does not hit any event.
        Error: Failed to delete events.
      254
    
    And it is more appropriate to return -ENOENT instead of -EPERM.

    x86/mce: Init some CPU features early
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5204bf17031b69fa5faa4dc80a9dc1e2446d74f9 ]
    
    When the MCA banks in __mcheck_cpu_init_generic() are polled for leftover
    errors logged during boot or from the previous boot, its required to have
    CPU features detected sufficiently so that the reading out and handling of
    those early errors is done correctly.
    
    If those features are not available, the decoding may miss some information
    and get incomplete errors logged. For example, on SMCA systems the MCA_IPID
    and MCA_SYND registers are not logged and MCA_ADDR is not masked
    appropriately.
    
    To cure that, do a subset of the basic feature detection early while the
    rest happens in its usual place in __mcheck_cpu_init_vendor().

    netem: apply correct delay when rate throttling
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5080f39e8c72e01cf37e8359023e7018e2a4901e ]
    
    I recently reported on the netem list that iperf network benchmarks
    show unexpected results when a bandwidth throttling rate has been
    configured for netem. Specifically:
    
    1) The measured link bandwidth *increases* when a higher delay is added
    2) The measured link bandwidth appears higher than the specified limit
    3) The measured link bandwidth for the same very slow settings varies significantly across
      machines
    
    The issue can be reproduced by using tc to configure netem with a
    512kbit rate and various (none, 1us, 50ms, 100ms, 200ms) delays on a
    veth pair between network namespaces, and then using iperf (or any
    other network benchmarking tool) to test throughput. Complete detailed
    instructions are in the original email chain here:
    https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/netem/2017-February/001672.html
    
    There appear to be two underlying bugs causing these effects:
    
    - The first issue causes long delays when the rate is slow and no
      delay is configured (e.g., "rate 512kbit"). This is because SKBs are
      not orphaned when no delay is configured, so orphaning does not
      occur until *after* the rate-induced delay has been applied. For
      this reason, adding a tiny delay (e.g., "rate 512kbit delay 1us")
      dramatically increases the measured bandwidth.
    
    - The second issue is that rate-induced delays are not correctly
      applied, allowing SKB delays to occur in parallel. The indended
      approach is to compute the delay for an SKB and to add this delay to
      the end of the current queue. However, the code does not detect
      existing SKBs in the queue due to improperly testing sch->q.qlen,
      which is nonzero even when packets exist only in the
      rbtree. Consequently, new SKBs do not wait for the current queue to
      empty. When packet delays vary significantly (e.g., if packet sizes
      are different), then this also causes unintended reordering.
    
    I modified the code to expect a delay (and orphan the SKB) when a rate
    is configured. I also added some defensive tests that correctly find
    the latest scheduled delivery time, even if it is (unexpectedly) for a
    packet in sch->q. I have tested these changes on the latest kernel
    (4.11.0-rc1+) and the iperf / ping test results are as expected.

    ath10k: fix fetching channel during potential radar detection
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a28f6f27a88f047f03f04b9246ca260ebc91455e ]
    
    Fetch target operating channel during potential radar detection when
    the interface is just brought up, but no channel is assigned from
    userspace. In this scenario rx_channel may not be having a valid pointer
    hence fetch the target operating channel to avoid warnings as below
    which can be triggered by the commands with DFS testing over longer run
    
    comamnds:
    iw wlan1 set type mesh
    ifconfig wlan1 up (valid tgt_oper_chan only)
    iw wlan1 cac trigger freq 5260 HT20 (valid rx_channel, tgt_oper_chan)
    iw wlan1 cac trigger freq 5280 HT20
    iw wlan1 cac trigger freq 5300 HT20
    
    Once the CAC expires, current channel context will be removed and
    we are only left with the fallback option of using 'target operating
    channel'

    If DFS is not enabled in hostapd (ieee80211h=0) DFS channels shall
    not be available for use even though the hardware may have the capability

    bring up ath10k device in DFS channel for AP mode fails and trying to
    simulate DFS in ath10k debugfs results in a warning in cfg80211 complaining
    invalid channel and this should be avoided in the driver itself rather than
    false propogating RADAR detection to mac80211/cfg80211. Fix this by
    checking for the first vif 'is_started' state(should work for client mode
    as well) as all the vifs shall be configured for the same channel

    drm: Defer disabling the vblank IRQ until the next interrupt (for instant-off)
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 608b20506941969ea30d8c08dc9ae02bb87dbf7d ]
    
    On vblank instant-off systems, we can get into a situation where the cost
    of enabling and disabling the vblank IRQ around a drmWaitVblank query
    dominates. And with the advent of even deeper hardware sleep state,
    touching registers becomes ever more expensive.  However, we know that if
    the user wants the current vblank counter, they are also very likely to
    immediately queue a vblank wait and so we can keep the interrupt around
    and only turn it off if we have no further vblank requests queued within
    the interrupt interval.
    
    After vblank event delivery, this patch adds a shadow of one vblank where
    the interrupt is kept alive for the user to query and queue another vblank
    event. Similarly, if the user is using blocking drmWaitVblanks, the
    interrupt will be disabled on the IRQ following the wait completion.
    However, if the user is simply querying the current vblank counter and
    timestamp, the interrupt will be disabled after every IRQ and the user
    will enabled it again on the first query following the IRQ.
    
    v2: Mario Kleiner -
    After testing this, one more thing that would make sense is to move
    the disable block at the end of drm_handle_vblank() instead of at the
    top.
    
    Turns out that if high precision timestaming is disabled or doesn't
    work for some reason (as can be simulated by echo 0 >
    /sys/module/drm/parameters/timestamp_precision_usec), then with your
    delayed disable code at its current place, the vblank counter won't
    increment anymore at all for instant queries, ie. with your other
    "instant query" patches. Clients which repeatedly query the counter
    and wait for it to progress will simply hang, spinning in an endless
    query loop. There's that comment in vblank_disable_and_save:
    
    "* Skip this step if there isn't any high precision timestamp
     * available. In that case we can't account for this and just
     * hope for the best.
     */
    
    With the disable happening after leading edge of vblank (== hw counter
    increment already happened) but before the vblank counter/timestamp
    handling in drm_handle_vblank, that step is needed to keep the counter
    progressing, so skipping it is bad.
    
    Now without high precision timestamping support, a kms driver must not
    set dev->vblank_disable_immediate = true, as this would cause problems
    for clients, so this shouldn't matter, but it would be good to still
    make this robust against a future kms driver which might have
    unreliable high precision timestamping, e.g., high precision
    timestamping that intermittently doesn't work.
    
    v3: Patch before coffee needs extra coffee.

    ARM: brcmstb: Enable ZONE_DMA for non 64-bit capable peripherals
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 3c51b9c7f1fae00c25f1e34da649a288e3fea1ae ]
    
    Some Host Controller hardware blocks, like the OHCI, EHCI and SDIO
    controllers, have hardware blocks that are not capable of doing 64 bit
    DMA. These host controllers fail on boards with >3GB of memory because
    the memory above 3GB is located physically >= 0x100000000 and can only
    be accessed using 64 DMA. The way Linux is currently configured for
    BRCMSTB systems, the memory given to drivers for DMA through functions
    like dma_alloc_coherent() comes from CMA memory and CMA memory is taken
    from the top of physical memory. When these drivers get a DMA buffer
    with an address >=0x100000000, they end up dropping the upper 32 bit of
    the address causing the hardware to DMA to incorrect memory, typically
    BMEM (custom memory carveout). This issue was discovered on a
    BCM97449SSV_DDR4 system with 4GB or memory.
    
    The fix is to enable CONFIG_ZONE_DMA. On ARM systems this makes sure
    that all DMA memory is located within the first 32 bits of address
    space.

    perf tools: Make perf_event__synthesize_mmap_events() scale
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 88b897a30c525c2eee6e7f16e1e8d0f18830845e ]
    
    This patch significantly improves the execution time of
    perf_event__synthesize_mmap_events() when running perf record on systems
    where processes have lots of threads.
    
    It just happens that cat /proc/pid/maps support uses a O(N^2) algorithm to
    generate each map line in the maps file.  If you have 1000 threads, then you
    have necessarily 1000 stacks.  For each vma, you need to check if it
    corresponds to a thread's stack.  With a large number of threads, this can take
    a very long time. I have seen latencies >> 10mn.
    
    As of today, perf does not use the fact that a mapping is a stack, therefore we
    can work around the issue by using /proc/pid/tasks/pid/maps.  This entry does
    not try to map a vma to stack and is thus much faster with no loss of
    functonality.
    
    The proc-map-timeout logic is kept in case users still want some upper limit.
    
    In V2, we fix the file path from /proc/pid/tasks/pid/maps to actual
    /proc/pid/task/pid/maps, tasks -> task.  Thanks Arnaldo for catching this.
    
    Committer note:
    
    This problem seems to have been elliminated in the kernel since commit :
    b18cb64ead40 ("fs/proc: Stop trying to report thread stacks").

    eventpoll.h: fix epoll event masks

    When userspace tries to use these defines, it complains that it needs to
    be an unsigned 1 that is shifted, so libc implementations have to create
    their own version.  Fix this by defining it properly so that libcs can
    just use the kernel uapi header.

    x86/mce: Handle broadcasted MCE gracefully with kexec
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5bc329503e8191c91c4c40836f062ef771d8ba83 ]
    
    When we are about to kexec a crash kernel and right then and there a
    broadcasted MCE fires while we're still in the first kernel and while
    the other CPUs remain in a holding pattern, the #MC handler of the
    first kernel will timeout and then panic due to never completing MCE
    synchronization.
    
    Handle this in a similar way as to when the CPUs are offlined when that
    broadcasted MCE happens.

    x86/mm: Make mmap(MAP_32BIT) work correctly
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 3e6ef9c80946f781fc25e8490c9875b1d2b61158 ]
    
    mmap(MAP_32BIT) is broken due to the dependency on the TIF_ADDR32 thread
    flag.
    
    For 64bit applications MAP_32BIT will force legacy bottom-up allocations and
    the 1GB address space restriction even if the application issued a compat
    syscall, which should not be subject of these restrictions.
    
    For 32bit applications, which issue 64bit syscalls the newly introduced
    mmap base separation into 64-bit and compat bases changed the behaviour
    because now a 64-bit mapping is returned, but due to the TIF_ADDR32
    dependency MAP_32BIT is ignored. Before the separation a 32-bit mapping was
    returned, so the MAP_32BIT handling was irrelevant.
    
    Replace the check for TIF_ADDR32 with a check for the compat syscall. That
    solves both the 64-bit issuing a compat syscall and the 32-bit issuing a
    64-bit syscall problems.

    security_socket_bind() reads the IP address bytes, including the
    uninitialized ones, to determine the port, or e.g. pass them further to
    sel_netnode_find(), which uses them to calculate a hash.

    PCI/MSI: Stop disabling MSI/MSI-X in pci_device_shutdown()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit fda78d7a0ead144f4b2cdb582dcba47911f4952c ]
    
    The pci_bus_type .shutdown method, pci_device_shutdown(), is called from
    device_shutdown() in the kernel restart and shutdown paths.
    
    Previously, pci_device_shutdown() called pci_msi_shutdown() and
    pci_msix_shutdown().  This disables MSI and MSI-X, which causes the device
    to fall back to raising interrupts via INTx.  But the driver is still bound
    to the device, it doesn't know about this change, and it likely doesn't
    have an INTx handler, so these INTx interrupts cause "nobody cared"
    warnings like this:
    
      irq 16: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)
      CPU: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 4.8.2-1.el7_UNSUPPORTED.x86_64 #1
      Hardware name: Hewlett-Packard HP Z820 Workstation/158B, BIOS J63 v03.90 06/
      ...
    
    The MSI disabling code was added by d52877c7b1af ("pci/irq: let
    pci_device_shutdown to call pci_msi_shutdown v2") because a driver left MSI
    enabled and kdump failed because the kexeced kernel wasn't prepared to
    receive the MSI interrupts.
    
    Subsequent commits 1851617cd2da ("PCI/MSI: Disable MSI at enumeration even
    if kernel doesn't support MSI") and  e80e7edc55ba ("PCI/MSI: Initialize MSI
    capability for all architectures") changed the kexeced kernel to disable
    all MSIs itself so it no longer depends on the crashed kernel to clean up
    after itself.
    
    Stop disabling MSI/MSI-X in pci_device_shutdown().  This resolves the
    "nobody cared" unhandled IRQ issue above.  It also allows PCI serial
    devices, which may rely on the MSI interrupts, to continue outputting
    messages during reboot/shutdown.

    drm/sun4i: Fix TCON clock and regmap initialization sequence
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 4c7f16d14a33a9cfb4af9cb780d8a73bcca64a92 ]
    
    The TCON driver calls sun4i_tcon_init_regmap and sun4i_tcon_init_clocks
    in its bind function. The former creates a regmap and writes to several
    register to clear its configuration to a known default. The latter
    initializes various clocks. This includes enabling the bus clock for
    register access and creating the dotclock.
    
    In order for the first step's writes to work, the bus clock must be
    enabled which is done in the second step. but the dotclock's ops use
    the regmap created in the first step.
    
    Rearrange the function calls such that the clocks are initialized before
    the regmap, and split out the dot clock creation to after the regmap is
    initialized.

    drm/sun4i: Fix up error path cleanup for master bind function
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 9d56defb44b15427f4342c543a70fb7886fc06f5 ]
    
    The master bind function calls numerous drm functions which initialize
    underlying structures. It also tries to bind the various components
    of the display pipeline, some of which may add additional drm objects.
    
    This patch adds proper cleanup functions in the error path of the
    master bind function.
    
    This requires the patch "drm/sun4i: Move drm_mode_config_cleanup call
    to main driver", which splits out drm_mode_config_cleanup from
    sun4i_framebuffer_free so we can call it separately.

    drm: qxl: Don't alloc fbdev if emulation is not supported
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 861078381ba56b56808113736000d9e7ead349c8 ]
    
    If fbdev emulation is disabled, the QXL shutdown path will try to clean
    a framebuffer that wasn't initialized, hitting the Oops below.  The
    problem is that even when FBDEV_EMULATION is disabled we allocate the
    qfbdev strutucture, but we don't initialize it.  The fix is to stop
    allocating the memory, since it won't be used.  This allows the existing
    verification in the cleanup hook to do it's job preventing the oops.
    
    Now that we don't allocate the unused fbdev structure, we need to be
    careful when dereferencing it in the PM suspend hook.

    This patch fixes an issue in drivers/hid/hid-input.c where USB HID
    control null state flag is not checked upon rejecting inputs outside
    logical minimum-maximum range. The check should be made according to USB
    HID specification 1.11, section 6.2.2.5, p.31. The fix will resolve
    issues with some game controllers, such as:

    perf stat: Issue a HW watchdog disable hint
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 02d492e5dcb72c004d213756eb87c9d62a6d76a7 ]
    
    When using perf stat on an AMD F15h system with the default hw events
    attributes, some of the events don't get counted:
    
     Performance counter stats for 'sleep 1':
    
              0.749208      task-clock (msec)         #    0.001 CPUs utilized
                     1      context-switches          #    0.001 M/sec
                     0      cpu-migrations            #    0.000 K/sec
                    54      page-faults               #    0.072 M/sec
             1,122,815      cycles                    #    1.499 GHz
               286,740      stalled-cycles-frontend   #   25.54% frontend cycles idle
         <not counted>      stalled-cycles-backend                                        (0.00%)
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^
         <not counted>      instructions                                                  (0.00%)
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^
         <not counted>      branches                                                      (0.00%)
         <not counted>      branch-misses                                                 (0.00%)
    
           1.001550070 seconds time elapsed
    
    The reason is that we have the HW watchdog consuming one PMU counter and
    when perf tries to schedule 6 events on 6 counters and some of those
    counters are constrained to only a specific subset of PMCs by the
    hardware, the event scheduling fails.
    
    So issue a hint to disable the HW watchdog around a perf stat session.
    
    Committer note:
    
    Testing it...
    
      # perf stat -d usleep 1

      Some events weren't counted. Try disabling the NMI watchdog:
            echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
            perf stat ...
            echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog

    blkcg: fix double free of new_blkg in blkcg_init_queue
    
    commit 9b54d816e00425c3a517514e0d677bb3cec49258 upstream.
    
    If blkg_create fails, new_blkg passed as an argument will
    be freed by blkg_create, so there is no need to free it again.
