    arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c: work around gcc-4.4.4 bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ec45a192fe6e287f0fc06d5ca4f3bd446d94803 ]
    
    Fix this compile issue with gcc-4.4.4:
    
       arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c: In function 'kvm_mmu_pte_write':
       arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c:4256: error: unknown field 'cr0_wp' specified in initializer
       arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c:4257: error: unknown field 'cr4_pae' specified in initializer
       arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c:4257: warning: excess elements in union initializer
       ...
    
    gcc-4.4.4 (at least) has issues when using anonymous unions in
    initializers.

    md/raid0: fix restore to sector variable in raid0_make_request
    
    [ Upstream commit a81157768a00e8cf8a7b43b5ea5cac931262374f ]
    
    The variable "sector" in "raid0_make_request()" was improperly updated
    by a call to "sector_div()" which modifies its first argument in place.
    Commit 47d68979cc968535cb87f3e5f2e6a3533ea48fbd restored this variable
    after the call for later re-use.  Unfortunetly the restore was done after
    the referenced variable "bio" was advanced.  This lead to the original
    value and the restored value being different.  Here we move this line to
    the proper place.
    
    One observed side effect of this bug was discarding a file though
    unlinking would cause an unrelated file's contents to be discarded.
