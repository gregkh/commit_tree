    neighbour: allow NUD_NOARP entries to be forced GCed
    
    commit 7a6b1ab7475fd6478eeaf5c9d1163e7a18125c8f upstream.
    
    IFF_POINTOPOINT interfaces use NUD_NOARP entries for IPv6. It's possible to
    fill up the neighbour table with enough entries that it will overflow for
    valid connections after that.
    
    This behaviour is more prevalent after commit 58956317c8de ("neighbor:
    Improve garbage collection") is applied, as it prevents removal from
    entries that are not NUD_FAILED, unless they are more than 5s old.

    xen-netback: take a reference to the RX task thread
    
    commit 107866a8eb0b664675a260f1ba0655010fac1e08 upstream.
    
    Do this in order to prevent the task from being freed if the thread
    returns (which can be triggered by the frontend) before the call to
    kthread_stop done as part of the backend tear down. Not taking the
    reference will lead to a use-after-free in that scenario. Such
    reference was taken before but dropped as part of the rework done in
    2ac061ce97f4.
    
    Reintroduce the reference taking and add a comment this time
    explaining why it's needed.
    
    This is XSA-374 / CVE-2021-28691.

    lib/lz4: explicitly support in-place decompression
    
    commit 89b158635ad79574bde8e94d45dad33f8cf09549 upstream.
    
    LZ4 final literal copy could be overlapped when doing
    in-place decompression, so it's unsafe to just use memcpy()
    on an optimized memcpy approach but memmove() instead.
    
    Upstream LZ4 has updated this years ago [1] (and the impact
    is non-sensible [2] plus only a few bytes remain), this commit
    just synchronizes LZ4 upstream code to the kernel side as well.
    
    It can be observed as EROFS in-place decompression failure
    on specific files when X86_FEATURE_ERMS is unsupported,
    memcpy() optimization of commit 59daa706fbec ("x86, mem:
    Optimize memcpy by avoiding memory false dependece") will
    be enabled then.
    
    Currently most modern x86-CPUs support ERMS, these CPUs just
    use "rep movsb" approach so no problem at all. However, it can
    still be verified with forcely disabling ERMS feature...
    
    arch/x86/lib/memcpy_64.S:
            ALTERNATIVE_2 "jmp memcpy_orig", "", X86_FEATURE_REP_GOOD, \
    -                     "jmp memcpy_erms", X86_FEATURE_ERMS
    +                     "jmp memcpy_orig", X86_FEATURE_ERMS
    
    We didn't observe any strange on arm64/arm/x86 platform before
    since most memcpy() would behave in an increasing address order
    ("copy upwards" [3]) and it's the correct order of in-place
    decompression but it really needs an update to memmove() for sure
    considering it's an undefined behavior according to the standard
    and some unique optimization already exists in the kernel.

    commit 3d6b84132d2a57b5a74100f6923a8feb679ac2ce upstream.
    
    Crash shutdown handler only disables kvmclock and steal time, other PV
    features remain active so we risk corrupting memory or getting some
    side-effects in kdump kernel. Move crash handler to kvm.c and unify
    with CPU offline.

    x86/kvm: Disable kvmclock on all CPUs on shutdown
    
    commit c02027b5742b5aa804ef08a4a9db433295533046 upstream.
    
    Currenly, we disable kvmclock from machine_shutdown() hook and this
    only happens for boot CPU. We need to disable it for all CPUs to
    guard against memory corruption e.g. on restore from hibernate.
    
    Note, writing '0' to kvmclock MSR doesn't clear memory location, it
    just prevents hypervisor from updating the location so for the short
    while after write and while CPU is still alive, the clock remains usable
    and correct so we don't need to switch to some other clocksource.

    x86/kvm: Teardown PV features on boot CPU as well
    
    commit 8b79feffeca28c5459458fe78676b081e87c93a4 upstream.
    
    Various PV features (Async PF, PV EOI, steal time) work through memory
    shared with hypervisor and when we restore from hibernation we must
    properly teardown all these features to make sure hypervisor doesn't
    write to stale locations after we jump to the previously hibernated kernel
    (which can try to place anything there). For secondary CPUs the job is
    already done by kvm_cpu_down_prepare(), register syscore ops to do
    the same for boot CPU.
    
    Krzysztof:
    This fixes memory corruption visible after second resume from
    hibernation:

    KVM: arm64: Fix debug register indexing
    
    commit cb853ded1d25e5b026ce115dbcde69e3d7e2e831 upstream.
    
    Commit 03fdfb2690099 ("KVM: arm64: Don't write junk to sysregs on
    reset") flipped the register number to 0 for all the debug registers
    in the sysreg table, hereby indicating that these registers live
    in a separate shadow structure.
    
    However, the author of this patch failed to realise that all the
    accessors are using that particular index instead of the register
    encoding, resulting in all the registers hitting index 0. Not quite
    a valid implementation of the architecture...
    
    Address the issue by fixing all the accessors to use the CRm field
    of the encoding, which contains the debug register index.

    btrfs: fix unmountable seed device after fstrim
    
    commit 5e753a817b2d5991dfe8a801b7b1e8e79a1c5a20 upstream.
    
    The following test case reproduces an issue of wrongly freeing in-use
    blocks on the readonly seed device when fstrim is called on the rw sprout
    device. As shown below.
    
    Create a seed device and add a sprout device to it:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -fq -dsingle -msingle /dev/loop0
      $ btrfstune -S 1 /dev/loop0
      $ mount /dev/loop0 /btrfs
      $ btrfs dev add -f /dev/loop1 /btrfs
      BTRFS info (device loop0): relocating block group 290455552 flags system
      BTRFS info (device loop0): relocating block group 1048576 flags system
      BTRFS info (device loop0): disk added /dev/loop1
      $ umount /btrfs
    
    Mount the sprout device and run fstrim:
    
      $ mount /dev/loop1 /btrfs
      $ fstrim /btrfs
      $ umount /btrfs
    
    Now try to mount the seed device, and it fails:
    
      $ mount /dev/loop0 /btrfs
      mount: /btrfs: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop0, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.
    
    Block 5292032 is missing on the readonly seed device:
    
     $ dmesg -kt | tail
     <snip>
     BTRFS error (device loop0): bad tree block start, want 5292032 have 0
     BTRFS warning (device loop0): couldn't read-tree root
     BTRFS error (device loop0): open_ctree failed
    
    >From the dump-tree of the seed device (taken before the fstrim). Block
    5292032 belonged to the block group starting at 5242880:
    
      $ btrfs inspect dump-tree -e /dev/loop0 | grep -A1 BLOCK_GROUP
      <snip>
      item 3 key (5242880 BLOCK_GROUP_ITEM 8388608) itemoff 16169 itemsize 24
            block group used 114688 chunk_objectid 256 flags METADATA
      <snip>
    
    >From the dump-tree of the sprout device (taken before the fstrim).
    fstrim used block-group 5242880 to find the related free space to free:
    
      $ btrfs inspect dump-tree -e /dev/loop1 | grep -A1 BLOCK_GROUP
      <snip>
      item 1 key (5242880 BLOCK_GROUP_ITEM 8388608) itemoff 16226 itemsize 24
            block group used 32768 chunk_objectid 256 flags METADATA
      <snip>
    
    BPF kernel tracing the fstrim command finds the missing block 5292032
    within the range of the discarded blocks as below:
    
      kprobe:btrfs_discard_extent {
            printf("freeing start %llu end %llu num_bytes %llu:\n",
                    arg1, arg1+arg2, arg2);
      }
    
      freeing start 5259264 end 5406720 num_bytes 147456
      <snip>
    
    Fix this by avoiding the discard command to the readonly seed device.

    mm, hugetlb: fix simple resv_huge_pages underflow on UFFDIO_COPY
    
    [ Upstream commit d84cf06e3dd8c5c5b547b5d8931015fc536678e5 ]
    
    The userfaultfd hugetlb tests cause a resv_huge_pages underflow.  This
    happens when hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte() is called with !is_continue on
    an index for which we already have a page in the cache.  When this
    happens, we allocate a second page, double consuming the reservation,
    and then fail to insert the page into the cache and return -EEXIST.
    
    To fix this, we first check if there is a page in the cache which
    already consumed the reservation, and return -EEXIST immediately if so.
    
    There is still a rare condition where we fail to copy the page contents
    AND race with a call for hugetlb_no_page() for this index and again we
    will underflow resv_huge_pages.  That is fixed in a more complicated
    patch not targeted for -stable.
    
    Test:
    
      Hacked the code locally such that resv_huge_pages underflows produce a
      warning, then:
    
      ./tools/testing/selftests/vm/userfaultfd hugetlb_shared 10
            2 /tmp/kokonut_test/huge/userfaultfd_test && echo test success
      ./tools/testing/selftests/vm/userfaultfd hugetlb 10
            2 /tmp/kokonut_test/huge/userfaultfd_test && echo test success
    
    Both tests succeed and produce no warnings.  After the test runs number
    of free/resv hugepages is correct.

    btrfs: fix deadlock when cloning inline extents and low on available space
    
    commit 76a6d5cd74479e7ec8a7f9a29bce63d5549b6b2e upstream.
    
    There are a few cases where cloning an inline extent requires copying data
    into a page of the destination inode. For these cases we are allocating
    the required data and metadata space while holding a leaf locked. This can
    result in a deadlock when we are low on available space because allocating
    the space may flush delalloc and two deadlock scenarios can happen:
    
    1) When starting writeback for an inode with a very small dirty range that
       fits in an inline extent, we deadlock during the writeback when trying
       to insert the inline extent, at cow_file_range_inline(), if the extent
       is going to be located in the leaf for which we are already holding a
       read lock;
    
    2) After successfully starting writeback, for non-inline extent cases,
       the async reclaim thread will hang waiting for an ordered extent to
       complete if the ordered extent completion needs to modify the leaf
       for which the clone task is holding a read lock (for adding or
       replacing file extent items). So the cloning task will wait forever
       on the async reclaim thread to make progress, which in turn is
       waiting for the ordered extent completion which in turn is waiting
       to acquire a write lock on the same leaf.
    
    So fix this by making sure we release the path (and therefore the leaf)
    every time we need to copy the inline extent's data into a page of the
    destination inode, as by that time we do not need to have the leaf locked.

    btrfs: abort in rename_exchange if we fail to insert the second ref
    
    commit dc09ef3562726cd520c8338c1640872a60187af5 upstream.
    
    Error injection stress uncovered a problem where we'd leave a dangling
    inode ref if we failed during a rename_exchange.  This happens because
    we insert the inode ref for one side of the rename, and then for the
    other side.  If this second inode ref insert fails we'll leave the first
    one dangling and leave a corrupt file system behind.  Fix this by
    aborting if we did the insert for the first inode ref.

    btrfs: fixup error handling in fixup_inode_link_counts
    
    commit 011b28acf940eb61c000059dd9e2cfcbf52ed96b upstream.
    
    This function has the following pattern
    
            while (1) {
                    ret = whatever();
                    if (ret)
                            goto out;
            }
            ret = 0
    out:
            return ret;
    
    However several places in this while loop we simply break; when there's
    a problem, thus clearing the return value, and in one case we do a
    return -EIO, and leak the memory for the path.
    
    Fix this by re-arranging the loop to deal with ret == 1 coming from
    btrfs_search_slot, and then simply delete the
    
            ret = 0;
    out:
    
    bit so everybody can break if there is an error, which will allow for
    proper error handling to occur.

    We are unconditionally returning 0 in cleanup_ref_head, despite the fact

    btrfs: fix error handling in btrfs_del_csums
    
    commit b86652be7c83f70bf406bed18ecf55adb9bfb91b upstream.
    
    Error injection stress would sometimes fail with checksums on disk that
    did not have a corresponding extent.  This occurred because the pattern
    in btrfs_del_csums was
    
            while (1) {
                    ret = btrfs_search_slot();
                    if (ret < 0)
                            break;
            }
            ret = 0;
    out:
            btrfs_free_path(path);
            return ret;
    
    If we got an error from btrfs_search_slot we'd clear the error because
    we were breaking instead of goto out.  Instead of using goto out, simply
    handle the cases where we may leave a random value in ret, and get rid
    of the
    
            ret = 0;
    out:
    
    pattern and simply allow break to have the proper error reporting.  With
    this fix we properly abort the transaction and do not commit thinking we
    successfully deleted the csum.

    btrfs: mark ordered extent and inode with error if we fail to finish
    
    commit d61bec08b904cf171835db98168f82bc338e92e4 upstream.
    
    While doing error injection testing I saw that sometimes we'd get an
    abort that wouldn't stop the current transaction commit from completing.
    This abort was coming from finish ordered IO, but at this point in the
    transaction commit we should have gotten an error and stopped.
    
    It turns out the abort came from finish ordered io while trying to write
    out the free space cache.  It occurred to me that any failure inside of
    finish_ordered_io isn't actually raised to the person doing the writing,
    so we could have any number of failures in this path and think the
    ordered extent completed successfully and the inode was fine.
    
    Fix this by marking the ordered extent with BTRFS_ORDERED_IOERR, and
    marking the mapping of the inode with mapping_set_error, so any callers
    that simply call fdatawait will also get the error.
    
    With this we're seeing the IO error on the free space inode when we fail
    to do the finish_ordered_io.

    powerpc/kprobes: Fix validation of prefixed instructions across page boundary
    
    commit 82123a3d1d5a306fdf50c968a474cc60fe43a80f upstream.
    
    When checking if the probed instruction is the suffix of a prefixed
    instruction, we access the instruction at the previous word. If the
    probed instruction is the very first word of a module, we can end up
    trying to access an invalid page.
    
    Fix this by skipping the check for all instructions at the beginning of
    a page. Prefixed instructions cannot cross a 64-byte boundary and as
    such, we don't expect to encounter a suffix as the very first word in a
    page for kernel text. Even if there are prefixed instructions crossing
    a page boundary (from a module, for instance), the instruction will be
    illegal, so preventing probing on the suffix of such prefix instructions
    isn't worthwhile.

    x86/apic: Mark _all_ legacy interrupts when IO/APIC is missing
    
    commit 7d65f9e80646c595e8c853640a9d0768a33e204c upstream.
    
    PIC interrupts do not support affinity setting and they can end up on
    any online CPU. Therefore, it's required to mark the associated vectors
    as system-wide reserved. Otherwise, the corresponding irq descriptors
    are copied to the secondary CPUs but the vectors are not marked as
    assigned or reserved. This works correctly for the IO/APIC case.
    
    When the IO/APIC is disabled via config, kernel command line or lack of
    enumeration then all legacy interrupts are routed through the PIC, but
    nothing marks them as system-wide reserved vectors.
    
    As a consequence, a subsequent allocation on a secondary CPU can result in
    allocating one of these vectors, which triggers the BUG() in
    apic_update_vector() because the interrupt descriptor slot is not empty.
    
    Imran tried to work around that by marking those interrupts as allocated
    when a CPU comes online. But that's wrong in case that the IO/APIC is
    available and one of the legacy interrupts, e.g. IRQ0, has been switched to
    PIC mode because then marking them as allocated will fail as they are
    already marked as system vectors.
    
    Stay consistent and update the legacy vectors after attempting IO/APIC
    initialization and mark them as system vectors in case that no IO/APIC is
    available.

    x86/sev: Check SME/SEV support in CPUID first
    
    commit 009767dbf42ac0dbe3cf48c1ee224f6b778aa85a upstream.
    
    The first two bits of the CPUID leaf 0x8000001F EAX indicate whether SEV
    or SME is supported, respectively. It's better to check whether SEV or
    SME is actually supported before accessing the MSR_AMD64_SEV to check
    whether SEV or SME is enabled.
    
    This is both a bare-metal issue and a guest/VM issue. Since the first
    generation Hygon Dhyana CPU doesn't support the MSR_AMD64_SEV, reading that
    MSR results in a #GP - either directly from hardware in the bare-metal
    case or via the hypervisor (because the RDMSR is actually intercepted)
    in the guest/VM case, resulting in a failed boot. And since this is very
    early in the boot phase, rdmsrl_safe()/native_read_msr_safe() can't be
    used.
    
    So check the CPUID bits first, before accessing the MSR.

    x86/cpufeatures: Force disable X86_FEATURE_ENQCMD and remove update_pasid()
    
    commit 9bfecd05833918526cc7357d55e393393440c5fa upstream.
    
    While digesting the XSAVE-related horrors which got introduced with
    the supervisor/user split, the recent addition of ENQCMD-related
    functionality got on the radar and turned out to be similarly broken.
    
    update_pasid(), which is only required when X86_FEATURE_ENQCMD is
    available, is invoked from two places:
    
     1) From switch_to() for the incoming task
    
     2) Via a SMP function call from the IOMMU/SMV code
    
    #1 is half-ways correct as it hacks around the brokenness of get_xsave_addr()
       by enforcing the state to be 'present', but all the conditionals in that
       code are completely pointless for that.
    
       Also the invocation is just useless overhead because at that point
       it's guaranteed that TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD is set on the incoming task
       and all of this can be handled at return to user space.
    
    #2 is broken beyond repair. The comment in the code claims that it is safe
       to invoke this in an IPI, but that's just wishful thinking.
    
       FPU state of a running task is protected by fregs_lock() which is
       nothing else than a local_bh_disable(). As BH-disabled regions run
       usually with interrupts enabled the IPI can hit a code section which
       modifies FPU state and there is absolutely no guarantee that any of the
       assumptions which are made for the IPI case is true.
    
       Also the IPI is sent to all CPUs in mm_cpumask(mm), but the IPI is
       invoked with a NULL pointer argument, so it can hit a completely
       unrelated task and unconditionally force an update for nothing.
       Worse, it can hit a kernel thread which operates on a user space
       address space and set a random PASID for it.
    
    The offending commit does not cleanly revert, but it's sufficient to
    force disable X86_FEATURE_ENQCMD and to remove the broken update_pasid()
    code to make this dysfunctional all over the place. Anything more
    complex would require more surgery and none of the related functions
    outside of the x86 core code are blatantly wrong, so removing those
    would be overkill.
    
    As nothing enables the PASID bit in the IA32_XSS MSR yet, which is
    required to make this actually work, this cannot result in a regression
    except for related out of tree train-wrecks, but they are broken already
    today.

    mm/page_alloc: fix counting of free pages after take off from buddy
    
    commit bac9c6fa1f929213bbd0ac9cdf21e8e2f0916828 upstream.
    
    Recently we found that there is a lot MemFree left in /proc/meminfo
    after do a lot of pages soft offline, it's not quite correct.
    
    Before Oscar's rework of soft offline for free pages [1], if we soft
    offline free pages, these pages are left in buddy with HWPoison flag,
    and NR_FREE_PAGES is not updated immediately.  So the difference between
    NR_FREE_PAGES and real number of available free pages is also even big
    at the beginning.
    
    However, with the workload running, when we catch HWPoison page in any
    alloc functions subsequently, we will remove it from buddy, meanwhile
    update the NR_FREE_PAGES and try again, so the NR_FREE_PAGES will get
    more and more closer to the real number of available free pages.
    (regardless of unpoison_memory())
    
    Now, for offline free pages, after a successful call
    take_page_off_buddy(), the page is no longer belong to buddy allocator,
    and will not be used any more, but we missed accounting NR_FREE_PAGES in
    this situation, and there is no chance to be updated later.
    
    Do update in take_page_off_buddy() like rmqueue() does, but avoid double
    counting if some one already set_migratetype_isolate() on the page.

    mm/debug_vm_pgtable: fix alignment for pmd/pud_advanced_tests()
    
    commit 04f7ce3f07ce39b1a3ca03a56b238a53acc52cfd upstream.
    
    In pmd/pud_advanced_tests(), the vaddr is aligned up to the next pmd/pud
    entry, and so it does not match the given pmdp/pudp and (aligned down)
    pfn any more.
    
    For s390, this results in memory corruption, because the IDTE
    instruction used e.g.  in xxx_get_and_clear() will take the vaddr for
    some calculations, in combination with the given pmdp.  It will then end
    up with a wrong table origin, ending on ...ff8, and some of those
    wrongly set low-order bits will also select a wrong pagetable level for
    the index addition.  IDTE could therefore invalidate (or 0x20) something
    outside of the page tables, depending on the wrongly picked index, which
    in turn depends on the random vaddr.
    
    As result, we sometimes see "BUG task_struct (Not tainted): Padding
    overwritten" on s390, where one 0x5a padding value got overwritten with
    0x7a.
    
    Fix this by aligning down, similar to how the pmd/pud_aligned pfns are
    calculated.

    ocfs2: fix data corruption by fallocate
    
    commit 6bba4471f0cc1296fe3c2089b9e52442d3074b2e upstream.
    
    When fallocate punches holes out of inode size, if original isize is in
    the middle of last cluster, then the part from isize to the end of the
    cluster will be zeroed with buffer write, at that time isize is not yet
    updated to match the new size, if writeback is kicked in, it will invoke
    ocfs2_writepage()->block_write_full_page() where the pages out of inode
    size will be dropped.  That will cause file corruption.  Fix this by
    zero out eof blocks when extending the inode size.
    
    Running the following command with qemu-image 4.2.1 can get a corrupted
    coverted image file easily.
    
        qemu-img convert -p -t none -T none -f qcow2 $qcow_image \
                 -O qcow2 -o compat=1.1 $qcow_image.conv
    
    The usage of fallocate in qemu is like this, it first punches holes out
    of inode size, then extend the inode size.
    
        fallocate(11, FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE|FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, 2276196352, 65536) = 0
        fallocate(11, 0, 2276196352, 65536) = 0

    pid: take a reference when initializing `cad_pid`
    
    commit 0711f0d7050b9e07c44bc159bbc64ac0a1022c7f upstream.
    
    During boot, kernel_init_freeable() initializes `cad_pid` to the init
    task's struct pid.  Later on, we may change `cad_pid` via a sysctl, and
    when this happens proc_do_cad_pid() will increment the refcount on the
    new pid via get_pid(), and will decrement the refcount on the old pid
    via put_pid().  As we never called get_pid() when we initialized
    `cad_pid`, we decrement a reference we never incremented, can therefore
    free the init task's struct pid early.  As there can be dangling
    references to the struct pid, we can later encounter a use-after-free
    (e.g.  when delivering signals).
    
    This was spotted when fuzzing v5.13-rc3 with Syzkaller, but seems to
    have been around since the conversion of `cad_pid` to struct pid in
    commit 9ec52099e4b8 ("[PATCH] replace cad_pid by a struct pid") from the
    pre-KASAN stone age of v2.6.19.
    
    Fix this by getting a reference to the init task's struct pid when we
    assign it to `cad_pid`.
    
    Full KASAN splat below.

    When running generic/527 with fast_commit configuration, the following
    issue is seen on Power.  With fast_commit, during ext4_fc_replay()
    (which can be called from ext4_fill_super()), if inode eviction
    happens then it can access an uninitialized percpu counter variable.
    
    This patch adds the check before accessing the counters in
    ext4_free_inode() path.

    ext4: fix fast commit alignment issues
    
    commit a7ba36bc94f20b6c77f16364b9a23f582ea8faac upstream.
    
    Fast commit recovery data on disk may not be aligned. So, when the
    recovery code reads it, this patch makes sure that fast commit info
    found on-disk is first memcpy-ed into an aligned variable before
    accessing it. As a consequence of it, we also remove some macros that
    could resulted in unaligned accesses.

    go even further and make sure we fix the tree properly in case of ENOSPC

    HW problem or fs corruption so I'd rather leave the extent tree as is and
    don't try to fix it (which also means we will not create overlapping

    ext4: fix memory leak in ext4_fill_super
    
    commit afd09b617db3786b6ef3dc43e28fe728cfea84df upstream.
    
    Buffer head references must be released before calling kill_bdev();
    otherwise the buffer head (and its page referenced by b_data) will not
    be freed by kill_bdev, and subsequently that bh will be leaked.
    
    If blocksizes differ, sb_set_blocksize() will kill current buffers and
    page cache by using kill_bdev(). And then super block will be reread
    again but using correct blocksize this time. sb_set_blocksize() didn't
    fully free superblock page and buffer head, and being busy, they were
    not freed and instead leaked.
    
    This can easily be reproduced by calling an infinite loop of:
    
      systemctl start <ext4_on_lvm>.mount, and
      systemctl stop <ext4_on_lvm>.mount
    
    ... since systemd creates a cgroup for each slice which it mounts, and
    the bh leak get amplified by a dying memory cgroup that also never
    gets freed, and memory consumption is much more easily noticed.

    via VDDSOC_IN rail, add the PU input. Both VDD1P1, VDD2P5 are supplied
    from LTC3676 SW2 via VDDHIGH_IN rail, add both inputs.
    
    While no instability or problems are currently observed, the regulators
    should be fully described in DT and that description should fully match
    the hardware, else this might lead to unforseen issues later. Fix this.

    ALSA: hda: update the power_state during the direct-complete
    
    commit b8b90c17602689eeaa5b219d104bbc215d1225cc upstream.
    
    The patch_realtek.c needs to check if the power_state.event equals
    PM_EVENT_SUSPEND, after using the direct-complete, the suspend() and
    resume() will be skipped if the codec is already rt_suspended, in this
    case, the patch_realtek.c will always get PM_EVENT_ON even the system
    is really resumed from S3.
    
    We could set power_state to PMSG_SUSPEND in the prepare(), if other
    PM functions are called before complete(), those functions will
    override power_state; if no other PM functions are called before
    complete(), we could know the suspend() and resume() are skipped since
    only S3 pm functions could be skipped by direct-complete, in this case
    set power_state to PMSG_RESUME in the complete(). This could guarantee
    the first time of calling hda_codec_runtime_resume() after complete()
    has the correct power_state.

    Before this patch, in the unlikely event that gfs2_glock_dq encountered
    a withdraw, it would do a wait_on_bit to wait for its journal to be

    wireguard: allowedips: free empty intermediate nodes when removing single node
    
    commit bf7b042dc62a31f66d3a41dd4dfc7806f267b307 upstream.
    
    When removing single nodes, it's possible that that node's parent is an
    empty intermediate node, in which case, it too should be removed.
    Otherwise the trie fills up and never is fully emptied, leading to
    gradual memory leaks over time for tries that are modified often. There
    was originally code to do this, but was removed during refactoring in
    2016 and never reworked. Now that we have proper parent pointers from
    the previous commits, we can implement this properly.
    
    In order to reduce branching and expensive comparisons, we want to keep
    the double pointer for parent assignment (which lets us easily chain up
    to the root), but we still need to actually get the parent's base
    address. So encode the bit number into the last two bits of the pointer,
    and pack and unpack it as needed. This is a little bit clumsy but is the
    fastest and less memory wasteful of the compromises. Note that we align
    the root struct here to a minimum of 4, because it's embedded into a
    larger struct, and we're relying on having the bottom two bits for our
    flag, which would only be 16-bit aligned on m68k.
    
    The existing macro-based helpers were a bit unwieldy for adding the bit
    packing to, so this commit replaces them with safer and clearer ordinary
    functions.
    
    We add a test to the randomized/fuzzer part of the selftests, to free
    the randomized tries by-peer, refuzz it, and repeat, until it's supposed
    to be empty, and then then see if that actually resulted in the whole
    thing being emptied. That combined with kmemcheck should hopefully make
    sure this commit is doing what it should. Along the way this resulted in
    various other cleanups of the tests and fixes for recent graphviz.

    wireguard: allowedips: allocate nodes in kmem_cache
    
    commit dc680de28ca849dfe589dc15ac56d22505f0ef11 upstream.
    
    The previous commit moved from O(n) to O(1) for removal, but in the
    process introduced an additional pointer member to a struct that
    increased the size from 60 to 68 bytes, putting nodes in the 128-byte
    slab. With deployed systems having as many as 2 million nodes, this
    represents a significant doubling in memory usage (128 MiB -> 256 MiB).
    Fix this by using our own kmem_cache, that's sized exactly right. This
    also makes wireguard's memory usage more transparent in tools like
    slabtop and /proc/slabinfo.

    wireguard: allowedips: remove nodes in O(1)
    
    commit f634f418c227c912e7ea95a3299efdc9b10e4022 upstream.
    
    Previously, deleting peers would require traversing the entire trie in
    order to rebalance nodes and safely free them. This meant that removing
    1000 peers from a trie with a half million nodes would take an extremely
    long time, during which we're holding the rtnl lock. Large-scale users
    were reporting 200ms latencies added to the networking stack as a whole
    every time their userspace software would queue up significant removals.
    That's a serious situation.
    
    This commit fixes that by maintaining a double pointer to the parent's
    bit pointer for each node, and then using the already existing node list
    belonging to each peer to go directly to the node, fix up its pointers,
    and free it with RCU. This means removal is O(1) instead of O(n), and we
    don't use gobs of stack.
    
    The removal algorithm has the same downside as the code that it fixes:
    it won't collapse needlessly long runs of fillers.  We can enhance that
    in the future if it ever becomes a problem. This commit documents that
    limitation with a TODO comment in code, a small but meaningful
    improvement over the prior situation.
    
    Currently the biggest flaw, which the next commit addresses, is that
    because this increases the node size on 64-bit machines from 60 bytes to
    68 bytes. 60 rounds up to 64, but 68 rounds up to 128. So we wind up
    using twice as much memory per node, because of power-of-two
    allocations, which is a big bummer. We'll need to figure something out
    there.

    resulting in a NULL pointer dereference when used. Fix this by
    initializing it in the randomized trie test, just like we do for the
    static unit test.

    "self-test", so add it to the missing place here.

    wireguard: use synchronize_net rather than synchronize_rcu
    
    commit 24b70eeeb4f46c09487f8155239ebfb1f875774a upstream.
    
    Many of the synchronization points are sometimes called under the rtnl
    lock, which means we should use synchronize_net rather than
    synchronize_rcu. Under the hood, this expands to using the expedited
    flavor of function in the event that rtnl is held, in order to not stall
    other concurrent changes.
    
    This fixes some very, very long delays when removing multiple peers at
    once, which would cause some operations to take several minutes.

    wireguard: peer: allocate in kmem_cache
    
    commit a4e9f8e3287c9eb6bf70df982870980dd3341863 upstream.
    
    With deployments having upwards of 600k peers now, this somewhat heavy
    structure could benefit from more fine-grained allocations.
    Specifically, instead of using a 2048-byte slab for a 1544-byte object,
    we can now use 1544-byte objects directly, thus saving almost 25%
    per-peer, or with 600k peers, that's a savings of 303 MiB. This also
    makes wireguard's memory usage more transparent in tools like slabtop
    and /proc/slabinfo.

    wireguard: do not use -O3
    
    commit cc5060ca0285efe2728bced399a1955a7ce808b2 upstream.
    
    Apparently, various versions of gcc have O3-related miscompiles. Looking
    at the difference between -O2 and -O3 for gcc 11 doesn't indicate
    miscompiles, but the difference also doesn't seem so significant for
    performance that it's worth risking.

    Bluetooth: fix the erroneous flush_work() order
    
    commit 6a137caec23aeb9e036cdfd8a46dd8a366460e5d upstream.
    
    In the cleanup routine for failed initialization of HCI device,
    the flush_work(&hdev->rx_work) need to be finished before the
    flush_work(&hdev->cmd_work). Otherwise, the hci_rx_work() can
    possibly invoke new cmd_work and cause a bug, like double free,
    in late processings.
    
    This was assigned CVE-2021-3564.
    
    This patch reorder the flush_work() to fix this bug.

    Running "make" on an already compiled kernel tree will rebuild the
    kernel even without any modifications:
    
      CALL    linux/scripts/checksyscalls.sh
      CALL    linux/scripts/atomic/check-atomics.sh
      CHK     include/generated/compile.h
      SO2S    arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso-syms.S
      AS      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso-syms.o
      AR      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/built-in.a
      AR      arch/riscv/kernel/built-in.a
      AR      arch/riscv/built-in.a
      GEN     .version
      CHK     include/generated/compile.h
      UPD     include/generated/compile.h
      CC      init/version.o
      AR      init/built-in.a
      LD      vmlinux.o
    
    The reason is "Any target that utilizes if_changed must be listed in
    $(targets), otherwise the command line check will fail, and the target
    will always be built" as explained by Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.rst
    
    Fix this build bug by adding vdso-syms.S to $(targets)
    
    At the same time, there are two trivial clean up modifications:
    
    - the vdso-dummy.o is not needed any more after so remove it.
    
    - vdso.lds is a generated file, so it should be prefixed with
      $(obj)/ instead of $(src)/

    serial: stm32: fix threaded interrupt handling
    
    [ Upstream commit e359b4411c2836cf87c8776682d1b594635570de ]
    
    When DMA is enabled the receive handler runs in a threaded handler, but
    the primary handler up until very recently neither disabled interrupts
    in the device or used IRQF_ONESHOT. This would lead to a deadlock if an
    interrupt comes in while the threaded receive handler is running under
    the port lock.
    
    Commit ad7676812437 ("serial: stm32: fix a deadlock condition with
    wakeup event") claimed to fix an unrelated deadlock, but unfortunately
    also disabled interrupts in the threaded handler. While this prevents
    the deadlock mentioned in the previous paragraph it also defeats the
    purpose of using a threaded handler in the first place.
    
    Fix this by making the interrupt one-shot and not disabling interrupts
    in the threaded handler.
    
    Note that (receive) DMA must not be used for a console port as the
    threaded handler could be interrupted while holding the port lock,
    something which could lead to a deadlock in case an interrupt handler
    ends up calling printk.

    tipc: fix unique bearer names sanity check
    
    [ Upstream commit f20a46c3044c3f75232b3d0e2d09af9b25efaf45 ]
    
    When enabling a bearer by name, we don't sanity check its name with
    higher slot in bearer list. This may have the effect that the name
    of an already enabled bearer bypasses the check.
    
    To fix the above issue, we just perform an extra checking with all
    existing bearers.

    bus: ti-sysc: Fix flakey idling of uarts and stop using swsup_sidle_act
    
    [ Upstream commit c8692ad416dcc420ce1b403596a425c8f4c2720b ]
    
    Looks like the swsup_sidle_act quirk handling is unreliable for serial
    ports. The serial ports just eventually stop idling until woken up and
    re-idled again. As the serial port not idling blocks any deeper SoC idle
    states, it's adds an annoying random flakeyness for power management.
    
    Let's just switch to swsup_sidle quirk instead like we already do for
    omap3 uarts. This means we manually idle the port instead of trying to
    use the hardware autoidle features when not in use.
    
    For more details on why the serial ports have been using swsup_idle_act,
    see commit 66dde54e978a ("ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod-data: UART IP needs software
    control to manage sidle modes"). It seems that the swsup_idle_act quirk
    handling is not enough though, and for example the TI Android kernel
    changed to using swsup_sidle with commit 77c34c84e1e0 ("OMAP4: HWMOD:
    UART1: disable smart-idle.").

    [ Upstream commit 25201269c6ec3e9398426962ccdd55428261f7d0 ]
    
    During hardware validation it was noticed that the clock isn't
    continuously enabled when there is no link. This is because the 125MHz
    clock is derived from the internal PLL which seems to go into some kind
    of power-down mode every once in a while. The LS1028A expects a contiuous
    clock. Thus enable the PLL all the time.
    
    Also, the RGMII pad voltage is wrong. It was configured to 2.5V (that is
    the VDDH regulator). The correct voltage is 1.8V, i.e. the VDDIO
    regulator.
    
    This fix is for the freescale/fsl-ls1028a-kontron-sl28-var4.dts.

    bus: ti-sysc: Fix am335x resume hang for usb otg module
    
    [ Upstream commit 4d7b324e231366ea772ab10df46be31273ca39af ]
    
    On am335x, suspend and resume only works once, and the system hangs if
    suspend is attempted again. However, turns out suspend and resume works
    fine multiple times if the USB OTG driver for musb controller is loaded.
    
    The issue is caused my the interconnect target module losing context
    during suspend, and it needs a restore on resume to be reconfigure again
    as debugged earlier by Dave Gerlach <d-gerlach@ti.com>.
    
    There are also other modules that need a restore on resume, like gpmc as
    noted by Dave. So let's add a common way to restore an interconnect
    target module based on a quirk flag. For now, let's enable the quirk for
    am335x otg only to fix the suspend and resume issue.
    
    As gpmc is not causing hangs based on tests with BeagleBone, let's patch
    gpmc separately. For gpmc, we also need a hardware reset done before
    restore according to Dave.
    
    To reinit the modules, we decouple system suspend from PM runtime. We
    replace calls to pm_runtime_force_suspend() and pm_runtime_force_resume()
    with direct calls to internal functions and rely on the driver internal
    state. There no point trying to handle complex system suspend and resume
    quirks via PM runtime.
    
    This is issue should have already been noticed with commit 1819ef2e2d12
    ("bus: ti-sysc: Use swsup quirks also for am335x musb") when quirk
    handling was added for am335x otg for swsup. But the issue went unnoticed
    as having musb driver loaded hides the issue, and suspend and resume works
    once without the driver loaded.

    i40e: add correct exception tracing for XDP
    
    [ Upstream commit f6c10b48f8c8da44adaff730d8e700b6272add2b ]
    
    Add missing exception tracing to XDP when a number of different errors
    can occur. The support was only partial. Several errors where not
    logged which would confuse the user quite a lot not knowing where and
    why the packets disappeared.

    Optimize i40e_run_xdp_zc() for the XDP program verdict being
    XDP_REDIRECT in the xsk zero-copy path. This path is only used when
    having AF_XDP zero-copy on and in that case most packets will be
    directed to user space. This provides a little over 100k extra packets

    cxgb4: avoid link re-train during TC-MQPRIO configuration
    
    [ Upstream commit 3822d0670c9d4342794d73e0d0e615322b40438e ]
    
    When configuring TC-MQPRIO offload, only turn off netdev carrier and
    don't bring physical link down in hardware. Otherwise, when the
    physical link is brought up again after configuration, it gets
    re-trained and stalls ongoing traffic.
    
    Also, when firmware is no longer accessible or crashed, avoid sending
    FLOWC and waiting for reply that will never come.

    If the hardware is still accessing memory after SMMU translation
    is disabled (as part of smmu shutdown callback), then the
    IOVAs (I/O virtual address) which it was using will go on the bus
    as the physical addresses which will result in unknown crashes
    like NoC/interconnect errors.
    
    So, implement shutdown callback for i2c driver to suspend the bus
    during system "reboot" or "shutdown".

    ice: Allow all LLDP packets from PF to Tx
    
    [ Upstream commit f9f83202b7263ac371d616d6894a2c9ed79158ef ]
    
    Currently in the ice driver, the check whether to
    allow a LLDP packet to egress the interface from the
    PF_VSI is being based on the SKB's priority field.
    It checks to see if the packets priority is equal to
    TC_PRIO_CONTROL.  Injected LLDP packets do not always
    meet this condition.
    
    SCAPY defaults to a sk_buff->protocol value of ETH_P_ALL
    (0x0003) and does not set the priority field.  There will
    be other injection methods (even ones used by end users)
    that will not correctly configure the socket so that
    SKB fields are correctly populated.
    
    Then ethernet header has to have to correct value for
    the protocol though.
    
    Add a check to also allow packets whose ethhdr->h_proto
    matches ETH_P_LLDP (0x88CC).

    [ Upstream commit 5cd349c349d6ec52862e550d3576893d35ab8ac2 ]
    
    Ethtool incorrectly reported supported and advertised auto-negotiation
    settings for a backplane PHY image which did not support auto-negotiation.
    This can occur when using media or PHY type for reporting ethtool
    supported and advertised auto-negotiation settings.
    
    Remove setting supported and advertised auto-negotiation settings based
    on PHY type in ice_phy_type_to_ethtool(), and MAC type in
    ice_get_link_ksettings().
    
    Ethtool supported and advertised auto-negotiation settings should be
    based on the PHY image using the AQ command get PHY capabilities with
    media. Add setting supported and advertised auto-negotiation settings
    based get PHY capabilities with media in ice_get_link_ksettings().

    that removes the ability for a VF to request a different amount of

    either increase or decrease the number of queue pairs they are
    allocated. Fix this by using the variable vf->num_req_qs when

    In the ip6_route_info_create function, in the case that the nh pointer
    is not NULL, the fib6_nh in fib6_info has not been allocated.
    Therefore, when trying to free fib6_info in this error case using
    fib6_info_release, the function will call fib6_info_destroy_rcu,
    which it will access fib6_nh_release(f6i->fib6_nh);
    However, f6i->fib6_nh doesn't have any refcount yet given the lack of allocation
    causing the reported memory issue above.
    Therefore, releasing the empty pointer directly instead would be the solution.

    has moved searching for next highest priority HASH filter rule to

    the rule is removed from it and hence always finds at least 1 entry.
    Fix by removing the rule from rhashtable first before calling

    bpf, lockdown, audit: Fix buggy SELinux lockdown permission checks
    
    [ Upstream commit ff40e51043af63715ab413995ff46996ecf9583f ]
    
    Commit 59438b46471a ("security,lockdown,selinux: implement SELinux lockdown")
    added an implementation of the locked_down LSM hook to SELinux, with the aim
    to restrict which domains are allowed to perform operations that would breach
    lockdown. This is indirectly also getting audit subsystem involved to report
    events. The latter is problematic, as reported by Ondrej and Serhei, since it
    can bring down the whole system via audit:
    
      1) The audit events that are triggered due to calls to security_locked_down()
         can OOM kill a machine, see below details [0].
    
      2) It also seems to be causing a deadlock via avc_has_perm()/slow_avc_audit()
         when trying to wake up kauditd, for example, when using trace_sched_switch()
         tracepoint, see details in [1]. Triggering this was not via some hypothetical
         corner case, but with existing tools like runqlat & runqslower from bcc, for
         example, which make use of this tracepoint. Rough call sequence goes like:
    
         rq_lock(rq) -> -------------------------+
           trace_sched_switch() ->               |
             bpf_prog_xyz() ->                   +-> deadlock
               selinux_lockdown() ->             |
                 audit_log_end() ->              |
                   wake_up_interruptible() ->    |
                     try_to_wake_up() ->         |
                       rq_lock(rq) --------------+
    
    What's worse is that the intention of 59438b46471a to further restrict lockdown
    settings for specific applications in respect to the global lockdown policy is
    completely broken for BPF. The SELinux policy rule for the current lockdown check
    looks something like this:
    
      allow <who> <who> : lockdown { <reason> };
    
    However, this doesn't match with the 'current' task where the security_locked_down()
    is executed, example: httpd does a syscall. There is a tracing program attached
    to the syscall which triggers a BPF program to run, which ends up doing a
    bpf_probe_read_kernel{,_str}() helper call. The selinux_lockdown() hook does
    the permission check against 'current', that is, httpd in this example. httpd
    has literally zero relation to this tracing program, and it would be nonsensical
    having to write an SELinux policy rule against httpd to let the tracing helper
    pass. The policy in this case needs to be against the entity that is installing
    the BPF program. For example, if bpftrace would generate a histogram of syscall
    counts by user space application:
    
      bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'
    
    bpftrace would then go and generate a BPF program from this internally. One way
    of doing it [for the sake of the example] could be to call bpf_get_current_task()
    helper and then access current->comm via one of bpf_probe_read_kernel{,_str}()
    helpers. So the program itself has nothing to do with httpd or any other random
    app doing a syscall here. The BPF program _explicitly initiated_ the lockdown
    check. The allow/deny policy belongs in the context of bpftrace: meaning, you
    want to grant bpftrace access to use these helpers, but other tracers on the
    system like my_random_tracer _not_.
    
    Therefore fix all three issues at the same time by taking a completely different
    approach for the security_locked_down() hook, that is, move the check into the
    program verification phase where we actually retrieve the BPF func proto. This
    also reliably gets the task (current) that is trying to install the BPF tracing
    program, e.g. bpftrace/bcc/perf/systemtap/etc, and it also fixes the OOM since
    we're moving this out of the BPF helper's fast-path which can be called several
    millions of times per second.
    
    The check is then also in line with other security_locked_down() hooks in the
    system where the enforcement is performed at open/load time, for example,
    open_kcore() for /proc/kcore access or module_sig_check() for module signatures
    just to pick few random ones. What's out of scope in the fix as well as in
    other security_locked_down() hook locations /outside/ of BPF subsystem is that
    if the lockdown policy changes on the fly there is no retrospective action.
    This requires a different discussion, potentially complex infrastructure, and
    it's also not clear whether this can be solved generically. Either way, it is
    out of scope for a suitable stable fix which this one is targeting. Note that
    the breakage is specifically on 59438b46471a where it started to rely on 'current'
    as UAPI behavior, and _not_ earlier infrastructure such as 9d1f8be5cf42 ("bpf:
    Restrict bpf when kernel lockdown is in confidentiality mode").
    
    [0] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1955585, Jakub Hrozek says:
    
      I starting seeing this with F-34. When I run a container that is traced with
      BPF to record the syscalls it is doing, auditd is flooded with messages like:
    
      type=AVC msg=audit(1619784520.593:282387): avc:  denied  { confidentiality }
        for pid=476 comm="auditd" lockdown_reason="use of bpf to read kernel RAM"
          scontext=system_u:system_r:auditd_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:system_r:auditd_t:s0
            tclass=lockdown permissive=0
    
      This seems to be leading to auditd running out of space in the backlog buffer
      and eventually OOMs the machine.
    
      [...]
      auditd running at 99% CPU presumably processing all the messages, eventually I get:

    net/tls: Fix use-after-free after the TLS device goes down and up
    
    [ Upstream commit c55dcdd435aa6c6ad6ccac0a4c636d010ee367a4 ]
    
    When a netdev with active TLS offload goes down, tls_device_down is
    called to stop the offload and tear down the TLS context. However, the
    socket stays alive, and it still points to the TLS context, which is now
    deallocated. If a netdev goes up, while the connection is still active,
    and the data flow resumes after a number of TCP retransmissions, it will
    lead to a use-after-free of the TLS context.
    
    This commit addresses this bug by keeping the context alive until its
    normal destruction, and implements the necessary fallbacks, so that the
    connection can resume in software (non-offloaded) kTLS mode.
    
    On the TX side tls_sw_fallback is used to encrypt all packets. The RX
    side already has all the necessary fallbacks, because receiving
    non-decrypted packets is supported. The thing needed on the RX side is
    to block resync requests, which are normally produced after receiving
    non-decrypted packets.
    
    The necessary synchronization is implemented for a graceful teardown:
    first the fallbacks are deployed, then the driver resources are released
    (it used to be possible to have a tls_dev_resync after tls_dev_del).
    
    A new flag called TLS_RX_DEV_DEGRADED is added to indicate the fallback
    mode. It's used to skip the RX resync logic completely, as it becomes
    useless, and some objects may be released (for example, resync_async,
    which is allocated and freed by the driver).

    net/tls: Replace TLS_RX_SYNC_RUNNING with RCU
    
    [ Upstream commit 05fc8b6cbd4f979a6f25759c4a17dd5f657f7ecd ]
    
    RCU synchronization is guaranteed to finish in finite time, unlike a
    busy loop that polls a flag. This patch is a preparation for the bugfix
    in the next patch, where the same synchronize_net() call will also be
    used to sync with the TX datapath.

    net: dsa: tag_8021q: fix the VLAN IDs used for encoding sub-VLANs
    
    [ Upstream commit 4ef8d857b5f494e62bce9085031563fda35f9563 ]
    
    When using sub-VLANs in the range of 1-7, the resulting value from:
    
            rx_vid = dsa_8021q_rx_vid_subvlan(ds, port, subvlan);
    
    is wrong according to the description from tag_8021q.c:
    
     | 11  | 10  |  9  |  8  |  7  |  6  |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
     +-----------+-----+-----------------+-----------+-----------------------+
     |    DIR    | SVL |    SWITCH_ID    |  SUBVLAN  |          PORT         |
     +-----------+-----+-----------------+-----------+-----------------------+
    
    For example, when ds->index == 0, port == 3 and subvlan == 1,
    dsa_8021q_rx_vid_subvlan() returns 1027, same as it returns for
    subvlan == 0, but it should have returned 1043.
    
    This is because the low portion of the subvlan bits are not masked
    properly when writing into the 12-bit VLAN value. They are masked into
    bits 4:3, but they should be masked into bits 5:4.

    perf probe: Fix NULL pointer dereference in convert_variable_location()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3cb17cce1e76ccc5499915a4d7e095a1ad6bf7ff ]
    
    If we just check whether the variable can be converted, 'tvar' should be
    a null pointer. However, the null pointer check is missing in the
    'Constant value' execution path.
    
    The following cases can trigger this problem:
    
            $ cat test.c
            #include <stdio.h>
    
            void main(void)
            {
                    int a;
                    const int b = 1;
    
                    asm volatile("mov %1, %0" : "=r"(a): "i"(b));
                    printf("a: %d\n", a);
            }
    
            $ gcc test.c -o test -O -g
            $ sudo ./perf probe -x ./test -L "main"
            <main@/home/lhf/test.c:0>
                  0  void main(void)
                     {
                  2          int a;
                             const int b = 1;
    
                             asm volatile("mov %1, %0" : "=r"(a): "i"(b));
                  6          printf("a: %d\n", a);
                     }
    
            $ sudo ./perf probe -x ./test -V "main:6"
            Segmentation fault
    
    The check on 'tvar' is added. If 'tavr' is a null pointer, we return 0
    to indicate that the variable can be converted. Now, we can successfully
    show the variables that can be accessed.
    
            $ sudo ./perf probe -x ./test -V "main:6"
            Available variables at main:6
                    @<main+13>

                            int     a
                            int     b
    
    However, the variable 'b' cannot be tracked.
    
            $ sudo ./perf probe -x ./test -D "main:6 b"
            Failed to find the location of the 'b' variable at this address.
             Perhaps it has been optimized out.
             Use -V with the --range option to show 'b' location range.
              Error: Failed to add events.
    
    This is because __die_find_variable_cb() did not successfully match
    variable 'b', which has the DW_AT_const_value attribute instead of
    DW_AT_location. We added support for DW_AT_const_value in
    __die_find_variable_cb(). With this modification, we can successfully
    track the variable 'b'.
    
            $ sudo ./perf probe -x ./test -D "main:6 b"
            p:probe_test/main_L6 /home/lhf/test:0x1156 b=\1:s32

    [ Upstream commit 12b2aaadb6d5ef77434e8db21f469f46fe2d392e ]
    
    We have only 2 inline sg entries and we allow 4 sg entries for the send
    wr sge. Larger sgls entries will be chained. However when we build
    in-capsule send wr sge, we iterate without taking into account that the
    sgl may be chained and still fit in-capsule (which can happen if the sgl
    is bigger than 2, but lower-equal to 4).
    
    Fix in-capsule data mapping to correctly iterate chained sgls.

    mptcp: always parse mptcp options for MPC reqsk
    
    [ Upstream commit 06f9a435b3aa12f4de6da91f11fdce8ce7b46205 ]
    
    In subflow_syn_recv_sock() we currently skip options parsing
    for OoO packet, given that such packets may not carry the relevant
    MPC option.
    
    If the peer generates an MPC+data TSO packet and some of the early
    segments are lost or get reorder, we server will ignore the peer key,
    causing transient, unexpected fallback to TCP.
    
    The solution is always parsing the incoming MPTCP options, and
    do the fallback only for in-order packets. This actually cleans
    the existing code a bit.

    net/sched: act_ct: Fix ct template allocation for zone 0
    
    [ Upstream commit fb91702b743dec78d6507c53a2dec8a8883f509d ]
    
    Fix current behavior of skipping template allocation in case the
    ct action is in zone 0.
    
    Skipping the allocation may cause the datapath ct code to ignore the
    entire ct action with all its attributes (commit, nat) in case the ct
    action in zone 0 was preceded by a ct clear action.
    
    The ct clear action sets the ct_state to untracked and resets the
    skb->_nfct pointer. Under these conditions and without an allocated
    ct template, the skb->_nfct pointer will remain NULL which will
    cause the tc ct action handler to exit without handling commit and nat
    actions, if such exist.
    
    For example, the following rule in OVS dp:
    recirc_id(0x2),ct_state(+new-est-rel-rpl+trk),ct_label(0/0x1), \
    in_port(eth0),actions:ct_clear,ct(commit,nat(src=10.11.0.12)), \
    recirc(0x37a)
    
    Will result in act_ct skipping the commit and nat actions in zone 0.
    
    The change removes the skipping of template allocation for zone 0 and
    treats it the same as any other zone.

    devlink: Correct VIRTUAL port to not have phys_port attributes
    
    [ Upstream commit b28d8f0c25a9b0355116cace5f53ea52bd4020c8 ]
    
    Physical port name, port number attributes do not belong to virtual port
    flavour. When VF or SF virtual ports are registered they incorrectly
    append "np0" string in the netdevice name of the VF/SF.
    
    Before this fix, VF netdevice name were ens2f0np0v0, ens2f0np0v1 for VF
    0 and 1 respectively.
    
    After the fix, they are ens2f0v0, ens2f0v1.
    
    With this fix, reading /sys/class/net/ens2f0v0/phys_port_name returns
    -EOPNOTSUPP.
    
    Also devlink port show example for 2 VFs on one PF to ensure that any
    physical port attributes are not exposed.
    
    $ devlink port show
    pci/0000:06:00.0/65535: type eth netdev ens2f0np0 flavour physical port 0 splittable false
    pci/0000:06:00.3/196608: type eth netdev ens2f0v0 flavour virtual splittable false
    pci/0000:06:00.4/262144: type eth netdev ens2f0v1 flavour virtual splittable false
    
    This change introduces a netdevice name change on systemd/udev
    version 245 and higher which honors phys_port_name sysfs file for
    generation of netdevice name.
    
    This also aligns to phys_port_name usage which is limited to switchdev
    ports as described in [1].

    ipvs: ignore IP_VS_SVC_F_HASHED flag when adding service
    
    [ Upstream commit 56e4ee82e850026d71223262c07df7d6af3bd872 ]
    
    syzbot reported memory leak [1] when adding service with
    HASHED flag. We should ignore this flag both from sockopt
    and netlink provided data, otherwise the service is not
    hashed and not visible while releasing resources.

    [ Upstream commit 942859d969de7f6f7f2659a79237a758b42782da ]
    
    snprintf() should be given the full buffer size, not one less. And it
    guarantees nul-termination, so doing it manually afterwards is
    pointless.
    
    It's even potentially harmful (though probably not in practice because
    CPER_REC_LEN is 256), due to the "return how much would have been
    written had the buffer been big enough" semantics. I.e., if the bank
    and/or device strings are long enough that the "DIMM location ..."
    output gets truncated, writing to msg[n] is a buffer overflow.

    btrfs: tree-checker: do not error out if extent ref hash doesn't match
    
    commit 1119a72e223f3073a604f8fccb3a470ccd8a4416 upstream.
    
    The tree checker checks the extent ref hash at read and write time to
    make sure we do not corrupt the file system.  Generally extent
    references go inline, but if we have enough of them we need to make an
    item, which looks like
    
    key.objectid    = <bytenr>
    key.type        = <BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_REF_KEY|BTRFS_TREE_BLOCK_REF_KEY>
    key.offset      = hash(tree, owner, offset)
    
    However if key.offset collide with an unrelated extent reference we'll
    simply key.offset++ until we get something that doesn't collide.
    Obviously this doesn't match at tree checker time, and thus we error
    while writing out the transaction.  This is relatively easy to
    reproduce, simply do something like the following
    
      xfs_io -f -c "pwrite 0 1M" file
      offset=2
    
      for i in {0..10000}
      do
              xfs_io -c "reflink file 0 ${offset}M 1M" file
              offset=$(( offset + 2 ))
      done
    
      xfs_io -c "reflink file 0 17999258914816 1M" file
      xfs_io -c "reflink file 0 35998517829632 1M" file
      xfs_io -c "reflink file 0 53752752058368 1M" file
    
      btrfs filesystem sync
    
    And the sync will error out because we'll abort the transaction.  The
    magic values above are used because they generate hash collisions with
    the first file in the main subvol.
    
    The fix for this is to remove the hash value check from tree checker, as
