    ecryptfs: fix dereference of NULL user_key_payload
    
    commit f66665c09ab489a11ca490d6a82df57cfc1bea3e upstream.
    
    In eCryptfs, we failed to verify that the authentication token keys are
    not revoked before dereferencing their payloads, which is problematic
    because the payload of a revoked key is NULL.  request_key() *does* skip
    revoked keys, but there is still a window where the key can be revoked
    before we acquire the key semaphore.
    
    Fix it by updating ecryptfs_get_key_payload_data() to return
    -EKEYREVOKED if the key payload is NULL.  For completeness we check this
    for "encrypted" keys as well as "user" keys, although encrypted keys
    cannot be revoked currently.
    
    Alternatively we could use key_validate(), but since we'll also need to
    fix ecryptfs_get_key_payload_data() to validate the payload length, it
    seems appropriate to just check the payload pointer.

    regulator: fan53555: fix I2C device ids
    
    commit fc1111b885437f374ed54aadda44d8b241ebd2a3 upstream.
    
    The device tree nodes all correctly describe the regulators as
    syr827 or syr828, but the I2C device id is currently set to the
    wildcard value of syr82x in the driver.  This causes udev to fail
    to match the driver module with the modalias data from sysfs.
    
    Fix this by replacing the I2C device ids with ones that match the
    device tree descriptions, with syr827 and syr828.  Tested on
    Firefly rk3288 board.  The syr82x id was not used anywhere.

    ipsec: Fix aborted xfrm policy dump crash
    
    commit 1137b5e2529a8f5ca8ee709288ecba3e68044df2 upstream.
    
    An independent security researcher, Mohamed Ghannam, has reported
    this vulnerability to Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure
    program.
    
    The xfrm_dump_policy_done function expects xfrm_dump_policy to
    have been called at least once or it will crash.  This can be
    triggered if a dump fails because the target socket's receive
    buffer is full.
    
    This patch fixes it by using the cb->start mechanism to ensure that
    the initialisation is always done regardless of the buffer situation.

    commit 51e13359cd5ea34acc62c90627603352956380af upstream.
    
    If we try to connect while already connected/connecting, but
    this fails, we set ssid_len=0 but leave current_bss hanging,
    leading to errors.
    
    Check all of this better, first of all ensuring that we can't
    try to connect to a different SSID while connected/ing; ensure
    that prev_bssid is set for re-association attempts even in the
    case of the driver supporting the connect() method, and don't
    reset ssid_len in the failure cases.
    
    While at it, also reset ssid_len while disconnecting unless we
    were connected and expect a disconnected event, and warn on a
    successful connection without ssid_len being set.

    commit e1d2d1329a5722dbecc9c278303fcc4aa01f8790 upstream.
    
    To avoid kernel warning "Unhandled message (68)", ignore the
    CMD_FLUSH_QUEUE_REPLY message for now.
    
    As of Leaf v2 firmware version v4.1.844 (2017-02-15), flush tx queue is
    synchronous. There is a capability bit indicating whether flushing tx
    queue is synchronous or asynchronous.
    
    A proper solution would be to query the device for capabilities. If the
    synchronous tx flush capability bit is set, we should wait for
    CMD_FLUSH_QUEUE_REPLY message, while flushing the tx queue.

    scsi: zfcp: fix erp_action use-before-initialize in REC action trace
    
    commit ab31fd0ce65ec93828b617123792c1bb7c6dcc42 upstream.
    
    v4.10 commit 6f2ce1c6af37 ("scsi: zfcp: fix rport unblock race with LUN
    recovery") extended accessing parent pointer fields of struct
    zfcp_erp_action for tracing.  If an erp_action has never been enqueued
    before, these parent pointer fields are uninitialized and NULL. Examples
    are zfcp objects freshly added to the parent object's children list,
    before enqueueing their first recovery subsequently. In
    zfcp_erp_try_rport_unblock(), we iterate such list. Accessing erp_action
    fields can cause a NULL pointer dereference.  Since the kernel can read
    from lowcore on s390, it does not immediately cause a kernel page
    fault. Instead it can cause hangs on trying to acquire the wrong
    erp_action->adapter->dbf->rec_lock in zfcp_dbf_rec_action_lvl()
                          ^bogus^
    while holding already other locks with IRQs disabled.
    
    Real life example from attaching lots of LUNs in parallel on many CPUs:

        adapter = 0x0,
        port = 0x0,
        unit = 0x0,
      },
    }
    
    zfcp_erp_action is always fully embedded into its container object. Such
    container object is never moved in its object tree (only add or delete).
    Hence, erp_action parent pointers can never change.
    
    To fix the issue, initialize the erp_action parent pointers before
    adding the erp_action container to any list and thus before it becomes
    accessible from outside of its initializing function.
    
    In order to also close the time window between zfcp_erp_setup_act()
    memsetting the entire erp_action to zero and setting the parent pointers
    again, drop the memset and instead explicitly initialize individually
    all erp_action fields except for parent pointers. To be extra careful
    not to introduce any other unintended side effect, even keep zeroing the
    erp_action fields for list and timer. Also double-check with
    WARN_ON_ONCE that erp_action parent pointers never change, so we get to
    know when we would deviate from previous behavior.

    assoc_array: Fix a buggy node-splitting case
    
    commit ea6789980fdaa610d7eb63602c746bf6ec70cd2b upstream.
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-12193.
    
    Fix a case in the assoc_array implementation in which a new leaf is
    added that needs to go into a node that happens to be full, where the
    existing leaves in that node cluster together at that level to the
    exclusion of new leaf.
    
    What needs to happen is that the existing leaves get moved out to a new
    node, N1, at level + 1 and the existing node needs replacing with one,
    N0, that has pointers to the new leaf and to N1.
    
    The code that tries to do this gets this wrong in two ways:
    
     (1) The pointer that should've pointed from N0 to N1 is set to point
         recursively to N0 instead.
    
     (2) The backpointer from N0 needs to be set correctly in the case N0 is
         either the root node or reached through a shortcut.
    
    Fix this by removing this path and using the split_node path instead,
    which achieves the same end, but in a more general way (thanks to Eric
    Biggers for spotting the redundancy).
    
    The problem manifests itself as:

    The reason is that fuse erronously updates ctx->pos after a failed

    KVM: PPC: Fix oops when checking KVM_CAP_PPC_HTM
    
    commit ac64115a66c18c01745bbd3c47a36b124e5fd8c0 upstream.
    
    The following program causes a kernel oops:
    
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <sys/stat.h>
    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <sys/ioctl.h>
    #include <linux/kvm.h>
    
    main()
    {
        int fd = open("/dev/kvm", O_RDWR);
        ioctl(fd, KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION, KVM_CAP_PPC_HTM);
    }
    
    This happens because when using the global KVM fd with
    KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION, kvm_vm_ioctl_check_extension() gets
    called with a NULL kvm argument, which gets dereferenced
    in is_kvmppc_hv_enabled(). Spotted while reading the code.
    
    Let's use the hv_enabled fallback variable, like everywhere
    else in this function.

    usb: xhci: Handle error condition in xhci_stop_device()
    
    commit b3207c65dfafae27e7c492cb9188c0dc0eeaf3fd upstream.
    
    xhci_stop_device() calls xhci_queue_stop_endpoint() multiple times
    without checking the return value. xhci_queue_stop_endpoint() can
    return error if the HC is already halted or unable to queue commands.
    This can cause a deadlock condition as xhci_stop_device() would
    end up waiting indefinitely for a completion for the command that
    didn't get queued. Fix this by checking the return value and bailing
    out of xhci_stop_device() in case of error. This patch happens to fix
    potential memory leaks of the allocated command structures as well.

    workqueue: replace pool->manager_arb mutex with a flag
    
    commit 692b48258dda7c302e777d7d5f4217244478f1f6 upstream.
    
    Josef reported a HARDIRQ-safe -> HARDIRQ-unsafe lock order detected by
    lockdep:
    
     [ 1270.472259] WARNING: HARDIRQ-safe -> HARDIRQ-unsafe lock order detected
     [ 1270.472783] 4.14.0-rc1-xfstests-12888-g76833e8 #110 Not tainted
     [ 1270.473240] -----------------------------------------------------
     [ 1270.473710] kworker/u5:2/5157 [HC0[0]:SC0[0]:HE0:SE1] is trying to acquire:

     [ 1270.474994]
     [ 1270.474994] and this task is already holding:

     [ 1270.476046] which would create a new lock dependency:

     [ 1270.476949]
     [ 1270.476949] but this new dependency connects a HARDIRQ-irq-safe lock:
     [ 1270.477553]  (&pool->lock/1){-.-.}
     ...
     [ 1270.488900] to a HARDIRQ-irq-unsafe lock:
     [ 1270.489327]  (&(&lock->wait_lock)->rlock){+.+.}
     ...
     [ 1270.494735]  Possible interrupt unsafe locking scenario:

     [ 1270.495250]        CPU0                    CPU1
     [ 1270.495600]        ----                    ----
     [ 1270.495947]   lock(&(&lock->wait_lock)->rlock);

     [ 1270.496753]                                lock(&pool->lock/1);
     [ 1270.497205]                                lock(&(&lock->wait_lock)->rlock);
     [ 1270.497744]   <Interrupt>
     [ 1270.497948]     lock(&pool->lock/1);
    
    , which will cause a irq inversion deadlock if the above lock scenario
    happens.
    
    The root cause of this safe -> unsafe lock order is the
    mutex_unlock(pool->manager_arb) in manage_workers() with pool->lock
    held.
    
    Unlocking mutex while holding an irq spinlock was never safe and this
    problem has been around forever but it never got noticed because the
    only time the mutex is usually trylocked while holding irqlock making
    actual failures very unlikely and lockdep annotation missed the
    condition until the recent b9c16a0e1f73 ("locking/mutex: Fix
    lockdep_assert_held() fail").
    
    Using mutex for pool->manager_arb has always been a bit of stretch.
    It primarily is an mechanism to arbitrate managership between workers
    which can easily be done with a pool flag.  The only reason it became
    a mutex is that pool destruction path wants to exclude parallel
    managing operations.
    
    This patch replaces the mutex with a new pool flag POOL_MANAGER_ACTIVE
    and make the destruction path wait for the current manager on a wait
    queue.
    
    v2: Drop unnecessary flag clearing before pool destruction as
        suggested by Boqun.
