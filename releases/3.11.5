    net: qmi_wwan: add new Qualcomm devices
    
    commit 0470667caa8261beb8a9141102b04a5357dd45b5 upstream.
    
    Adding the device list from the Windows driver description files
    included with a new Qualcomm MDM9615 based device, "Alcatel-sbell
    ASB TL131 TDD LTE", from China Mobile.  This device is tested
    and verified to work.  The others are assumed to work based on
    using the same Windows driver.
    
    Many of these devices support multiple QMI/wwan ports, requiring
    multiple interface matching entries.  All devices are composite,
    providing a mix of one or more serial, storage or Android Debug
    Brigde functions in addition to the wwan function.
    
    This device list included an update of one previously known device,
    which was incorrectly assumed to have a Gobi 2K layout.  This is
    corrected.

    HID: uhid: allocate static minor
    
    commit 19872d20c890073c5207d9e02bb8f14d451a11eb upstream.
    
    udev has this nice feature of creating "dead" /dev/<node> device-nodes if
    it finds a devnode:<node> modalias. Once the node is accessed, the kernel
    automatically loads the module that provides the node. However, this
    requires udev to know the major:minor code to use for the node. This
    feature was introduced by:
    
      commit 578454ff7eab61d13a26b568f99a89a2c9edc881
      Author: Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

          driver core: add devname module aliases to allow module on-demand auto-loading
    
    However, uhid uses dynamic minor numbers so this doesn't actually work. We
    need to load uhid to know which minor it's going to use.
    
    Hence, allocate a static minor (just like uinput does) and we're good
    to go.

    Btrfs: skip subvol entries when checking if we've created a dir already
    
    commit a05254143cd183b18002cbba7759a1e4629aa762 upstream.
    
    We have logic to see if we've already created a parent directory by check to see
    if an inode inside of that directory has a lower inode number than the one we
    are currently processing.  The logic is that if there is a lower inode number
    then we would have had to made sure the directory was created at that previous
    point.  The problem is that subvols inode numbers count from the lowest objectid
    in the root tree, which may be less than our current progress.  So just skip if
    our dir item key is a root item.  This fixes the original test and the xfstest
    version I made that added an extra subvol create.  Thanks,

    Btrfs: change how we queue blocks for backref checking
    
    commit b6c60c8018c4e9beb2f83fc82c09f9d033766571 upstream.
    
    Previously we only added blocks to the list to have their backrefs checked if
    the level of the block is right above the one we are searching for.  This is
    because we want to make sure we don't add the entire path up to the root to the
    lists to make sure we process things one at a time.  This assumes that if any
    blocks in the path to the root are going to be not checked (shared in other
    words) then they will be in the level right above the current block on up.  This
    isn't quite right though since we can have blocks higher up the list that are
    shared because they are attached to a reloc root.  But we won't add this block
    to be checked and then later on we will BUG_ON(!upper->checked).  So instead
    keep track of wether or not we've queued a block to be checked in this current
    search, and if we haven't go ahead and queue it to be checked.  This patch fixed
    the panic I was seeing where we BUG_ON(!upper->checked).  Thanks,

    tile: use a more conservative __my_cpu_offset in CONFIG_PREEMPT
    
    commit f862eefec0b68e099a9fa58d3761ffb10bad97e1 upstream.
    
    It turns out the kernel relies on barrier() to force a reload of the
    percpu offset value.  Since we can't easily modify the definition of
    barrier() to include "tp" as an output register, we instead provide a
    definition of __my_cpu_offset as extended assembly that includes a fake
    stack read to hazard against barrier(), forcing gcc to know that it
    must reread "tp" and recompute anything based on "tp" after a barrier.
    
    This fixes observed hangs in the slub allocator when we are looping
    on a percpu cmpxchg_double.
    
    A similar fix for ARMv7 was made in June in change 509eb76ebf97.

    HID: wiimote: fix FF deadlock
    
    commit f50f9aabf32db7414551ffdfdccc71be5f3d6e7d upstream.
    
    The input core has an internal spinlock that is acquired during event
    injection via input_event() and friends but also held during FF callbacks.
    That means, there is no way to share a lock between event-injection and FF
    handling. Unfortunately, this is what is required for wiimote state
    tracking and what we do with state.lock and input->lock.
    
    This deadlock can be triggered when using continuous data reporting and FF
    on a wiimote device at the same time. I takes me at least 30m of
    stress-testing to trigger it but users reported considerably shorter
    times (http://bpaste.net/show/132504/) when using some gaming-console
    emulators.
    
    The real problem is that we have two copies of internal state, one in the
    wiimote objects and the other in the input device. As the input-lock is
    not supposed to be accessed from outside of input-core, we have no other
    chance than offloading FF handling into a worker. This actually works
    pretty nice and also allows to implictly merge fast rumble changes into a
    single request.
    
    Due to the 3-layered workers (rumble+queue+l2cap) this might reduce FF
    responsiveness. Initial tests were fine so lets fix the race first and if
    it turns out to be too slow we can always handle FF out-of-band and skip
    the queue-worker.

    xfs: fix node forward in xfs_node_toosmall
    
    commit 997def25e4b9cee3b01609e18a52f926bca8bd2b upstream.
    
    Commit f5ea1100 cleans up the disk to host conversions for
    node directory entries, but because a variable is reused in
    xfs_node_toosmall() the next node is not correctly found.
    If the original node is small enough (<= 3/8 of the node size),
    this change may incorrectly cause a node collapse when it should
    not. That will cause an assert in xfstest generic/319:
    
       Assertion failed: first <= last && last < BBTOB(bp->b_length),
       file: /root/newest/xfs/fs/xfs/xfs_trans_buf.c, line: 569
    
    Keep the original node header to get the correct forward node.
    
    (When a node is considered for a merge with a sibling, it overwrites the
     sibling pointers of the original incore nodehdr with the sibling's
     pointers.  This leads to loop considering the original node as a merge
     candidate with itself in the second pass, and so it incorrectly
     determines a merge should occur.)

     We were getting occasional "Scheduling while atomic" call traces
     during boot on some systems. Problem was first seen on a Cisco C210
     but we were able to reproduce it on a Cisco c220m3. Setting
     CONFIG_LOCKDEP and LOCKDEP_SUPPORT to 'y' exposed a lockdep around
     tx_msg_lock in acpi_ipmi.c struct acpi_ipmi_device.

    dmaengine: imx-dma: fix slow path issue in prep_dma_cyclic
    
    commit edc530fe7ee5a562680615d2e7cd205879c751a7 upstream.
    
    When perparing cyclic_dma buffers by the sound layer, it will dump the
    following lockdep trace. The leading snd_pcm_action_single get called
    with read_lock_irq called. To fix this, we change the kcalloc call from
    GFP_KERNEL to GFP_ATOMIC.

    dmaengine: imx-dma: fix callback path in tasklet
    
    commit fcaaba6c7136fe47e5a13352f99a64b019b6d2c5 upstream.
    
    We need to free the ld_active list head before jumping into the callback
    routine. Otherwise the callback could run into issue_pending and change
    our ld_active list head we just going to free. This will run the channel
    list into an currupted and undefined state.

    dmaengine: imx-dma: fix lockdep issue between irqhandler and tasklet
    
    commit 5a276fa6bdf82fd442046969603968c83626ce0b upstream.
    
    The tasklet and irqhandler are using spin_lock while other routines are
    using spin_lock_irqsave/restore. This leads to lockdep issues as
    described bellow. This patch is changing the code to use
    spinlock_irq_save/restore in both code pathes.
    
    As imxdma_xfer_desc always gets called with spin_lock_irqsave lock held,
    this patch also removes the spare call inside the routine to avoid
    double locking.

    drm/radeon: fix hdmi callbacks for rv6xx (incorrectly added to r520)
    
    Commit 99d79aa2f3b7729e7290e8bda5d0dd8b0240ec62 was backported slightly
    wrong adding callbacks in the wrong struct. This moves callbacks to the
    correct place (matching mainline patch/code).

    irq: Force hardirq exit's softirq processing on its own stack
    
    commit ded797547548a5b8e7b92383a41e4c0e6b0ecb7f upstream.
    
    The commit facd8b80c67a3cf64a467c4a2ac5fb31f2e6745b
    ("irq: Sanitize invoke_softirq") converted irq exit
    calls of do_softirq() to __do_softirq() on all architectures,
    assuming it was only used there for its irq disablement
    properties.
    
    But as a side effect, the softirqs processed in the end
    of the hardirq are always called on the inline current
    stack that is used by irq_exit() instead of the softirq
    stack provided by the archs that override do_softirq().
    
    The result is mostly safe if the architecture runs irq_exit()
    on a separate irq stack because then softirqs are processed
    on that same stack that is near empty at this stage (assuming
    hardirq aren't nesting).
    
    Otherwise irq_exit() runs in the task stack and so does the softirq
    too. The interrupted call stack can be randomly deep already and
    the softirq can dig through it even further. To add insult to the
    injury, this softirq can be interrupted by a new hardirq, maximizing
    the chances for a stack overrun as reported in powerpc for example:

    Since this is a regression, this patch proposes a minimalistic
    and low-risk solution by blindly forcing the hardirq exit processing of
    softirqs on the softirq stack. This way we should reduce significantly
    the opportunities for task stack overflow dug by softirqs.
    
    Longer term solutions may involve extending the hardirq stack coverage to
    irq_exit(), etc...

    iscsi-target: Only perform wait_for_tasks when performing shutdown
    
    commit e255a28598e8e63070322fc89bd34189dd660a89 upstream.
    
    This patch changes transport_generic_free_cmd() to only wait_for_tasks
    when shutdown=true is passed to iscsit_free_cmd().
    
    With the advent of >= v3.10 iscsi-target code using se_cmd->cmd_kref,
    the extra wait_for_tasks with shutdown=false is unnecessary, and may
    end up causing an extra context switch when releasing WRITEs.

    mm: avoid reinserting isolated balloon pages into LRU lists
    
    commit 117aad1e9e4d97448d1df3f84b08bd65811e6d6a upstream.
    
    Isolated balloon pages can wrongly end up in LRU lists when
    migrate_pages() finishes its round without draining all the isolated
    page list.
    
    The same issue can happen when reclaim_clean_pages_from_list() tries to
    reclaim pages from an isolated page list, before migration, in the CMA
    path.  Such balloon page leak opens a race window against LRU lists
    shrinkers that leads us to the following kernel panic:

    commit 60ce314d1750fef843e9db70050e09e49f838b69 upstream.
    
    The private array at the end of the rtl_priv struct is not aligned.
    On ARM architecture, this causes an alignment trap and is fixed by aligning
    that array with __align(sizeof(void *)). That should properly align that
    space according to the requirements of all architectures.

    ib_srpt: always set response for task management
    
    commit c807f64340932e19f0d2ac9b30c8381e1f60663a upstream.
    
    The SRP specification requires:
    
      "Response data shall be provided in any SRP_RSP response that is sent in
       response to an SRP_TSK_MGMT request (see 6.7). The information in the
       RSP_CODE field (see table 24) shall indicate the completion status of
       the task management function."
    
    So fix this to avoid the SRP initiator interprets task management functions
    that succeeded as failed.

    after srpt_destroy_ch_ib() had destroyed the active QP.
    
    This would result in the following failed SRP_LOGIN_REQ messages:

    USB: serial: option: Ignore card reader interface on Huawei E1750
    
    commit eb2addd4044b4b2ce77693bde5bc810536dd96ee upstream.
    
    Hi,
    
    my Huawei 3G modem has an embedded Smart Card reader which causes
    trouble when the modem is being detected (a bunch of "<warn>  (ttyUSBx):
    open blocked by driver for more than 7 seconds!" in messages.log). This
    trivial patch corrects the problem for me. The modem identifies itself
    as "12d1:1406 Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. E1750" in lsusb although the
    description on the body says "Model E173u-1"

    mwifiex: fix PCIe hs_cfg cancel cmd timeout
    
    commit b7be1522def9a9988b67afd0be999c50a96394b5 upstream.
    
    For pcie8897, the hs_cfg cancel command (0xe5) times out when host
    comes out of suspend. This is caused by an incompleted host sleep
    handshake between driver and firmware.
    
    Like SDIO interface, PCIe also needs to go through firmware power
    save events to complete the handshake for host sleep configuration.
    Only USB interface doesn't require power save events for hs_cfg.

    mwifiex: fix hang issue for USB chipsets

    Bug 60815 - Interface hangs in mwifiex_usb
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60815
    
    We have 4 bytes of interface header for packets delivered to SDIO
    and PCIe, but not for USB interface.
    
    In Tx AMSDU case, currently 4 bytes of garbage data is unnecessarily
    appended for USB packets. This sometimes leads to a firmware hang,
    because it may not interpret the data packet correctly.
    
    Problem is fixed by removing this redundant headroom for USB.

    staging: comedi: ni_65xx: (bug fix) confine insn_bits to one subdevice
    
    commit 677a31565692d596ef42ea589b53ba289abf4713 upstream.
    
    The `insn_bits` handler `ni_65xx_dio_insn_bits()` has a `for` loop that
    currently writes (optionally) and reads back up to 5 "ports" consisting
    of 8 channels each.  It reads up to 32 1-bit channels but can only read
    and write a whole port at once - it needs to handle up to 5 ports as the
    first channel it reads might not be aligned on a port boundary.  It
    breaks out of the loop early if the next port it handles is beyond the
    final port on the card.  It also breaks out early on the 5th port in the
    loop if the first channel was aligned.  Unfortunately, it doesn't check
    that the current port it is dealing with belongs to the comedi subdevice
    the `insn_bits` handler is acting on.  That's a bug.
    
    Redo the `for` loop to terminate after the final port belonging to the
    subdevice, changing the loop variable in the process to simplify things
    a bit.  The `for` loop could now try and handle more than 5 ports if the
    subdevice has more than 40 channels, but the test `if (bitshift >= 32)`
    ensures it will break out early after 4 or 5 ports (depending on whether
    the first channel is aligned on a port boundary).  (`bitshift` will be
    between -7 and 7 inclusive on the first iteration, increasing by 8 for
    each subsequent operation.)

    kernel/kmod.c: check for NULL in call_usermodehelper_exec()
    
    commit 4c1c7be95c345cf2ad537a0c48e9aeadc7304527 upstream.
    
    If /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern contains only "|", a NULL pointer
    dereference happens upon core dump because argv_split("") returns
    argv[0] == NULL.
    
    This bug was once fixed by commit 264b83c07a84 ("usermodehelper: check
    subprocess_info->path != NULL") but was by error reintroduced by commit
    7f57cfa4e2aa ("usermodehelper: kill the sub_info->path[0] check").
    
    This bug seems to exist since 2.6.19 (the version which core dump to
    pipe was added).  Depending on kernel version and config, some side
    effect might happen immediately after this oops (e.g.  kernel panic with
    2.6.32-358.18.1.el6).

    The "force" parameter in __blk_queue_bounce was being ignored, which
    means that stable page snapshots are not always happening (on ext3).

    mm: Fix generic hugetlb pte check return type.
    
    [ Upstream commit 26794942461f438a6bc725ec7294b08a6bd782c4 ]
    
    The include/asm-generic/hugetlb.h stubs that just vector huge_pte_*()
    calls to the pte_*() implementations won't work in certain situations.
    
    x86 and sparc, for example, return "unsigned long" from the bit
    checks, and just go "return pte_val(pte) & PTE_BIT_FOO;"
    
    But since huge_pte_*() returns 'int', if any high bits on 64-bit are
    relevant, they get chopped off.
    
    The net effect is that we can loop forever trying to COW a huge page,
    because the huge_pte_write() check signals false all the time.

    esp_scsi: Fix tag state corruption when autosensing.
    
    [ Upstream commit 21af8107f27878813d0364733c0b08813c2c192a ]
    
    Meelis Roos reports a crash in esp_free_lun_tag() in the presense
    of a disk which has died.
    
    The issue is that when we issue an autosense command, we do so by
    hijacking the original command that caused the check-condition.
    
    When we do so we clear out the ent->tag[] array when we issue it via
    find_and_prep_issuable_command().  This is so that the autosense
    command is forced to be issued non-tagged.
    
    That is problematic, because it is the value of ent->tag[] which
    determines whether we issued the original scsi command as tagged
    vs. non-tagged (see esp_alloc_lun_tag()).
    
    And that, in turn, is what trips up the sanity checks in
    esp_free_lun_tag().  That function needs the original ->tag[] values
    in order to free up the tag slot properly.
    
    Fix this by remembering the original command's tag values, and
    having esp_alloc_lun_tag() and esp_free_lun_tag() use them.

    The length argument to strlcpy was still wrong. It could overflow the end of
    full_boot_str by 5 bytes. Instead of strcat and strlcpy, just use snprint.

    sparc64: Fix buggy strlcpy() conversion in ldom_reboot().
    
    [ Upstream commit 2bd161a605f1f84a5fc8a4fe8410113a94f79355 ]
    
    Commit 117a0c5fc9c2d06045bd217385b2b39ea426b5a6 ("sparc: kernel: using
    strlcpy() instead of strcpy()") added a bug to ldom_reboot in
    arch/sparc/kernel/ds.c
    
    -               strcpy(full_boot_str + strlen("boot "), boot_command);
    +                                    strlcpy(full_boot_str + strlen("boot "), boot_command,
    +                                                            sizeof(full_boot_str + strlen("boot ")));
    
    That last sizeof() expression evaluates to sizeof(size_t) which is
    not what was intended.
    
    Also even the corrected:
    
         sizeof(full_boot_str) + strlen("boot ")
    
    is not right as the destination buffer length is just plain
    "sizeof(full_boot_str)" and that's what the final argument
    should be.

    ipc: fix race with LSMs
    
    commit 53dad6d3a8e5ac1af8bacc6ac2134ae1a8b085f1 upstream.
    
    Currently, IPC mechanisms do security and auditing related checks under
    RCU.  However, since security modules can free the security structure,
    for example, through selinux_[sem,msg_queue,shm]_free_security(), we can
    race if the structure is freed before other tasks are done with it,
    creating a use-after-free condition.  Manfred illustrates this nicely,
    for instance with shared mem and selinux:
    
     -> do_shmat calls rcu_read_lock()
     -> do_shmat calls shm_object_check().
         Checks that the object is still valid - but doesn't acquire any locks.
         Then it returns.
     -> do_shmat calls security_shm_shmat (e.g. selinux_shm_shmat)
     -> selinux_shm_shmat calls ipc_has_perm()
     -> ipc_has_perm accesses ipc_perms->security
    
    shm_close()
     -> shm_close acquires rw_mutex & shm_lock
     -> shm_close calls shm_destroy
     -> shm_destroy calls security_shm_free (e.g. selinux_shm_free_security)
     -> selinux_shm_free_security calls ipc_free_security(&shp->shm_perm)
     -> ipc_free_security calls kfree(ipc_perms->security)
    
    This patch delays the freeing of the security structures after all RCU
    readers are done.  Furthermore it aligns the security life cycle with
    that of the rest of IPC - freeing them based on the reference counter.
    For situations where we need not free security, the current behavior is
    kept.  Linus states:
    
     "... the old behavior was suspect for another reason too: having the
      security blob go away from under a user sounds like it could cause
      various other problems anyway, so I think the old code was at least
      _prone_ to bugs even if it didn't have catastrophic behavior."
    
    I have tested this patch with IPC testcases from LTP on both my
    quad-core laptop and on a 64 core NUMA server.  In both cases selinux is
    enabled, and tests pass for both voluntary and forced preemption models.
    While the mentioned races are theoretical (at least no one as reported
    them), I wanted to make sure that this new logic doesn't break anything
    we weren't aware of.

    ipc,msg: prevent race with rmid in msgsnd,msgrcv
    
    commit 4271b05a227dc6175b66c3d9941aeab09048aeb2 upstream.
    
    This fixes a race in both msgrcv() and msgsnd() between finding the msg
    and actually dealing with the queue, as another thread can delete shmid
    underneath us if we are preempted before acquiring the
    kern_ipc_perm.lock.
    
    Manfred illustrates this nicely:
    
    Assume a preemptible kernel that is preempted just after
    
        msq = msq_obtain_object_check(ns, msqid)
    
    in do_msgrcv().  The only lock that is held is rcu_read_lock().
    
    Now the other thread processes IPC_RMID.  When the first task is
    resumed, then it will happily wait for messages on a deleted queue.
    
    Fix this by checking for if the queue has been deleted after taking the
    lock.

    ipc/sem.c: fix race in sem_lock()
    
    commit 5e9d527591421ccdb16acb8c23662231135d8686 upstream.
    
    The exclusion of complex operations in sem_lock() is insufficient: after
    acquiring the per-semaphore lock, a simple op must first check that
    sem_perm.lock is not locked and only after that test check
    complex_count.  The current code does it the other way around - and that
    creates a race.  Details are below.
    
    The patch is a complete rewrite of sem_lock(), based in part on the code
    from Mike Galbraith.  It removes all gotos and all loops and thus the
    risk of livelocks.
    
    I have tested the patch (together with the next one) on my i3 laptop and
    it didn't cause any problems.
    
    The bug is probably also present in 3.10 and 3.11, but for these kernels
    it might be simpler just to move the test of sma->complex_count after
    the spin_is_locked() test.
    
    Details of the bug:
    
    Assume:
     - sma->complex_count = 0.
     - Thread 1: semtimedop(complex op that must sleep)
     - Thread 2: semtimedop(simple op).
    
    Pseudo-Trace:
    
    Thread 1: sem_lock(): acquire sem_perm.lock
    Thread 1: sem_lock(): check for ongoing simple ops
                            Nothing ongoing, thread 2 is still before sem_lock().
    Thread 1: try_atomic_semop()
            <<< preempted.
    
    Thread 2: sem_lock():
            static inline int sem_lock(struct sem_array *sma, struct sembuf *sops,
                                          int nsops)
            {
                    int locknum;
             again:
                    if (nsops == 1 && !sma->complex_count) {

    nilfs2: fix issue with race condition of competition between segments for dirty blocks
    
    commit 7f42ec3941560f0902fe3671e36f2c20ffd3af0a upstream.
    
    Many NILFS2 users were reported about strange file system corruption
    (for example):
    
       NILFS: bad btree node (blocknr=185027): level = 0, flags = 0x0, nchildren = 768
       NILFS error (device sda4): nilfs_bmap_last_key: broken bmap (inode number=11540)
    
    But such error messages are consequence of file system's issue that takes
    place more earlier.  Fortunately, Jerome Poulin <jeromepoulin@gmail.com>
    and Anton Eliasson <devel@antoneliasson.se> were reported about another
    issue not so recently.  These reports describe the issue with segctor
    thread's crash:
    
      BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 0000000000004c83
      IP: nilfs_end_page_io+0x12/0xd0 [nilfs2]
    
      Call Trace:
       nilfs_segctor_do_construct+0xf25/0x1b20 [nilfs2]
       nilfs_segctor_construct+0x17b/0x290 [nilfs2]
       nilfs_segctor_thread+0x122/0x3b0 [nilfs2]
       kthread+0xc0/0xd0
       ret_from_fork+0x7c/0xb0
    
    These two issues have one reason.  This reason can raise third issue
    too.  Third issue results in hanging of segctor thread with eating of
    100% CPU.
    
    REPRODUCING PATH:
    
    One of the possible way or the issue reproducing was described by
    Jermoe me Poulin <jeromepoulin@gmail.com>:
    
    1. init S to get to single user mode.
    2. sysrq+E to make sure only my shell is running
    3. start network-manager to get my wifi connection up
    4. login as root and launch "screen"
    5. cd /boot/log/nilfs which is a ext3 mount point and can log when NILFS dies.
    6. lscp | xz -9e > lscp.txt.xz
    7. mount my snapshot using mount -o cp=3360839,ro /dev/vgUbuntu/root /mnt/nilfs
    8. start a screen to dump /proc/kmsg to text file since rsyslog is killed
    9. start a screen and launch strace -f -o find-cat.log -t find
    /mnt/nilfs -type f -exec cat {} > /dev/null \;
    10. start a screen and launch strace -f -o apt-get.log -t apt-get update
    11. launch the last command again as it did not crash the first time
    12. apt-get crashes
    13. ps aux > ps-aux-crashed.log
    13. sysrq+W
    14. sysrq+E  wait for everything to terminate
    15. sysrq+SUSB
    
    Simplified way of the issue reproducing is starting kernel compilation
    task and "apt-get update" in parallel.
    
    REPRODUCIBILITY:
    
    The issue is reproduced not stable [60% - 80%].  It is very important to
    have proper environment for the issue reproducing.  The critical
    conditions for successful reproducing:
    
    (1) It should have big modified file by mmap() way.
    
    (2) This file should have the count of dirty blocks are greater that
        several segments in size (for example, two or three) from time to time
        during processing.
    
    (3) It should be intensive background activity of files modification
        in another thread.
    
    INVESTIGATION:
    
    First of all, it is possible to see that the reason of crash is not valid
    page address:
    
      NILFS [nilfs_segctor_complete_write]:2100 bh->b_count 0, bh->b_blocknr 13895680, bh->b_size 13897727, bh->b_page 0000000000001a82
      NILFS [nilfs_segctor_complete_write]:2101 segbuf->sb_segnum 6783
    
    Moreover, value of b_page (0x1a82) is 6786.  This value looks like segment
    number.  And b_blocknr with b_size values look like block numbers.  So,
    buffer_head's pointer points on not proper address value.
    
    Detailed investigation of the issue is discovered such picture:

    Usually, for every segment we collect dirty files in list.  Then, dirty
    blocks are gathered for every dirty file, prepared for write and
    submitted by means of nilfs_segbuf_submit_bh() call.  Finally, it takes
    place complete write phase after calling nilfs_end_bio_write() on the
    block layer.  Buffers/pages are marked as not dirty on final phase and
    processed files removed from the list of dirty files.
    
    It is possible to see that we had three prepare_write and submit_bio
    phases before segbuf_wait and complete_write phase.  Moreover, segments
    compete between each other for dirty blocks because on every iteration
    of segments processing dirty buffer_heads are added in several lists of
    payload_buffers:
    
      [SEGMENT 6784]: bh->b_assoc_buffers.next ffff880218a0d5f8, bh->b_assoc_buffers.prev ffff880218bcdf50
      [SEGMENT 6785]: bh->b_assoc_buffers.next ffff880218a0d5f8, bh->b_assoc_buffers.prev ffff880222cc7ee8
    
    The next pointer is the same but prev pointer has changed.  It means
    that buffer_head has next pointer from one list but prev pointer from
    another.  Such modification can be made several times.  And, finally, it
    can be resulted in various issues: (1) segctor hanging, (2) segctor
    crashing, (3) file system metadata corruption.
    
    FIX:
    This patch adds:
    
    (1) setting of BH_Async_Write flag in nilfs_segctor_prepare_write()
        for every proccessed dirty block;
    
    (2) checking of BH_Async_Write flag in
        nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() and
        nilfs_lookup_dirty_node_buffers();
    
    (3) clearing of BH_Async_Write flag in nilfs_segctor_complete_write(),
        nilfs_abort_logs(), nilfs_forget_buffer(), nilfs_clear_dirty_page().

    Bluetooth: Fix rfkill functionality during the HCI setup stage
    
    commit bf5430360ebe4b2d0c51d91f782e649107b502eb upstream.
    
    We need to let the setup stage complete cleanly even when the HCI device
    is rfkilled. Otherwise the HCI device will stay in an undefined state
    and never get notified to user space through mgmt (even when it gets
    unblocked through rfkill).
    
    This patch makes sure that hci_dev_open() can be called in the HCI_SETUP
    stage, that blocking the device doesn't abort the setup stage, and that
    the device gets proper powered down as soon as the setup stage completes
    in case it was blocked meanwhile.
    
    The bug that this patch fixed can be very easily reproduced using e.g.
    the rfkill command line too. By running "rfkill block all" before
    inserting a Bluetooth dongle the resulting HCI device goes into a state
    where it is never announced over mgmt, not even when "rfkill unblock all"
    is run.

    Bluetooth: Introduce a new HCI_RFKILLED flag
    
    commit 5e130367d43ff22836bbae380d197d600fe8ddbb upstream.
    
    This makes it more convenient to check for rfkill (no need to check for
    dev->rfkill before calling rfkill_blocked()) and also avoids potential
    races if the RFKILL state needs to be checked from within the rfkill
    callback.

    Bluetooth: Fix security level for peripheral role
    
    commit f8776218e8546397be64ad2bc0ebf4748522d6e3 upstream.
    
    While playing the peripheral role, the host gets a LE Long Term Key
    Request Event from the controller when a connection is established
    with a bonded device. The host then informs the LTK which should be
    used for the connection. Once the link is encrypted, the host gets
    an Encryption Change Event.
    
    Therefore we should set conn->pending_sec_level instead of conn->
    sec_level in hci_le_ltk_request_evt. This way, conn->sec_level is
    properly updated in hci_encrypt_change_evt.
    
    Moreover, since we have a LTK associated to the device, we have at
    least BT_SECURITY_MEDIUM security level.

    brcmfmac: obtain platform data upon module initialization
    
    commit db4efbbeb457b6f9f4d8c4b090d1170d12f026e1 upstream.
    
    The driver uses platform_driver_probe() to obtain platform data
    if any. However, that function is placed in the .init section so
    it must be called upon driver module initialization.
    
    The problem was reported by Fenguang Wu resulting in a kernel
    oops because the .init section was already freed.

    fuse: fix fallocate vs. ftruncate race
    
    commit 0ab08f576b9e6a6b689fc6b4e632079b978e619b upstream.
    
    A former patch introducing FUSE_I_SIZE_UNSTABLE flag provided detailed
    description of races between ftruncate and anyone who can extend i_size:
    
    > 1. As in the previous scenario fuse_dentry_revalidate() discovered that i_size
    > changed (due to our own fuse_do_setattr()) and is going to call
    > truncate_pagecache() for some  'new_size' it believes valid right now. But by
    > the time that particular truncate_pagecache() is called ...
    > 2. fuse_do_setattr() returns (either having called truncate_pagecache() or
    > not -- it doesn't matter).
    > 3. The file is extended either by write(2) or ftruncate(2) or fallocate(2).
    > 4. mmap-ed write makes a page in the extended region dirty.
    
    This patch adds necessary bits to fuse_file_fallocate() to protect from that
    race.

    fuse: wait for writeback in fuse_file_fallocate()
    
    commit bde52788bdb755b9e4b75db6c434f30e32a0ca0b upstream.
    
    The patch fixes a race between mmap-ed write and fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE):
    
    1) An user makes a page dirty via mmap-ed write.
    2) The user performs fallocate(2) with mode == PUNCH_HOLE|KEEP_SIZE
       and <offset, size> covering the page.
    3) Before truncate_pagecache_range call from fuse_file_fallocate,
       the page goes to write-back. The page is fully processed by fuse_writepage
       (including end_page_writeback on the page), but fuse_flush_writepages did
       nothing because fi->writectr < 0.
    4) truncate_pagecache_range is called and fuse_file_fallocate is finishing
       by calling fuse_release_nowrite. The latter triggers processing queued
       write-back request which will write stale data to the hole soon.
    
    Changed in v2 (thanks to Brian for suggestion):
     - Do not truncate page cache until FUSE_FALLOCATE succeeded. Otherwise,
       we can end up in returning -ENOTSUPP while user data is already punched
       from page cache. Use filemap_write_and_wait_range() instead.
    Changed in v3 (thanks to Miklos for suggestion):
     - fuse_wait_on_writeback() is prone to livelocks; use fuse_set_nowrite()
       instead. So far as we need a dirty-page barrier only, fuse_sync_writes()
       should be enough.
     - rebased to for-linus branch of fuse.git

    commit 8f21bd0090052e740944f9397e2be5ac7957ded7 upstream.
    
    The csum_partial_copy_generic() function saves the PowerPC non-volatile
    r14, r15, and r16 registers for the main checksum-and-copy loop.
    Unfortunately, it fails to restore them upon error exit from this loop,
    which results in silent corruption of these registers in the presumably
    rare event of an access exception within that loop.
    
    This commit therefore restores these register on error exit from the loop.

    powerpc/sysfs: Disable writing to PURR in guest mode
    
    commit d1211af3049f4c9c1d8d4eb8f8098cc4f4f0d0c7 upstream.
    
    arch/powerpc/kernel/sysfs.c exports PURR with write permission.
    This may be valid for kernel in phyp mode. But writing to
    the file in guest mode causes crash due to a priviledge violation

    powerpc: Fix memory hotplug with sparse vmemmap
    
    commit f7e3334a6bcb42e7295a9bd9cb36ca4e6e4e66b4 upstream.
    
    Previous commit 46723bfa540... introduced a new config option
    HAVE_BOOTMEM_INFO_NODE that ended up breaking memory hot-remove for ppc
    when sparse vmemmap is not defined.
    
    This patch defines HAVE_BOOTMEM_INFO_NODE for ppc and adds the call to
    register_page_bootmem_info_node. Without this we get a BUG_ON for memory
    hot remove in put_page_bootmem().
    
    This also adds a stub for register_page_bootmem_memmap to allow ppc to build
    with sparse vmemmap defined. Leaving this as a stub is fine since the same
    vmemmap addresses are also handled in vmemmap_populate and as such are
    properly mapped.

    powerpc: Fix parameter clobber in csum_partial_copy_generic()
    
    commit d9813c3681a36774b254c0cdc9cce53c9e22c756 upstream.
    
    The csum_partial_copy_generic() uses register r7 to adjust the remaining
    bytes to process.  Unfortunately, r7 also holds a parameter, namely the
    address of the flag to set in case of access exceptions while reading
    the source buffer.  Lacking a quantum implementation of PowerPC, this
    commit instead uses register r9 to do the adjusting, leaving r7's
    pointer uncorrupted.

    powerpc/tm: Switch out userspace PPR and DSCR sooner
    
    commit e9bdc3d6143d1c4b8d8ce5231fc958268331f983 upstream.
    
    When we do a treclaim or trecheckpoint we end up running with userspace
    PPR and DSCR values.  Currently we don't do anything special to avoid
    running with user values which could cause a severe performance
    degradation.
    
    This patch moves the PPR and DSCR save and restore around treclaim and
    trecheckpoint so that we run with user values for a much shorter period.
    More care is taken with the PPR as it's impact is greater than the DSCR.
    
    This is similar to user exceptions, where we run HTM_MEDIUM early to
    ensure that we don't run with a userspace PPR values in the kernel.

    powerpc/perf: Fix handling of FAB events
    
    commit a53b27b3abeef406de92a2bb0ceb6fb4c3fb8fc4 upstream.
    
    Commit 4df4899 "Add power8 EBB support" included a bug in the handling
    of the FAB_CRESP_MATCH and FAB_TYPE_MATCH fields.
    
    These values are pulled out of the event code using EVENT_THR_CTL_SHIFT,
    however we were then or'ing that value directly into MMCR1.
    
    This meant we were failing to set the FAB fields correctly, and also
    potentially corrupting the value for PMC4SEL. Leading to no counts for
    the FAB events and incorrect counts for PMC4.
    
    The fix is simply to shift left the FAB value correctly before or'ing it
    with MMCR1.

    powerpc/iommu: Use GFP_KERNEL instead of GFP_ATOMIC in iommu_init_table()
    
    commit 1cf389df090194a0976dc867b7fffe99d9d490cb upstream.
    
    Under heavy (DLPAR?) stress, we tripped this panic() in
    arch/powerpc/kernel/iommu.c::iommu_init_table():
    
            page = alloc_pages_node(nid, GFP_ATOMIC, get_order(sz));
            if (!page)
                    panic("iommu_init_table: Can't allocate %ld bytes\n", sz);
    
    Before the panic() we got a page allocation failure for an order-2
    allocation. There appears to be memory free, but perhaps not in the
    ATOMIC context. I looked through all the call-sites of
    iommu_init_table() and didn't see any obvious reason to need an ATOMIC
    allocation. Most call-sites in fact have an explicit GFP_KERNEL
    allocation shortly before the call to iommu_init_table(), indicating we
    are not in an atomic context. There is some indirection for some paths,
    but I didn't see any locks indicating that GFP_KERNEL is inappropriate.
    
    With this change under the same conditions, we have not been able to
    reproduce the panic.

    We currently reset and enable the SMMU before the device has finished
    being probed, so if we fail later on (for example, because we couldn't
    request a global irq successfully) then we will leave the device in an
    active state.
    
    This patch delays the reset and enabling of the SMMU hardware until

    gpio/omap: auto-setup a GPIO when used as an IRQ
    
    commit fac7fa162a19100298d5d91359960037dc5bfca9 upstream.
    
    The OMAP GPIO controller HW requires a pin to be configured in GPIO
    input mode in order to operate as an interrupt input. Since drivers
    should not be aware of whether an interrupt pin is also a GPIO or not,
    the HW should be fully configured/enabled as an IRQ if a driver solely
    uses IRQ APIs such as request_irq(), and never calls any GPIO-related
    APIs. As such, add the missing HW setup to the OMAP GPIO controller's
    irq_chip driver.
    
    Since this bypasses the GPIO subsystem we have to ensure that another
    driver won't be able to request the same GPIO pin that is used as an
    IRQ and set its direction as output. Requesting the GPIO and setting
    its direction as input is allowed though.
    
    This fixes smsc911x ethernet support for tobi and igep OMAP3 boards
    and OMAP4 SDP SPI based ethernet that use a GPIO as an interrupt line.

    fs/binfmt_elf.c: prevent a coredump with a large vm_map_count from Oopsing
    
    commit 72023656961b8c81a168a7a6762d589339d0d7ec upstream.
    
    A high setting of max_map_count, and a process core-dumping with a large
    enough vm_map_count could result in an NT_FILE note not being written,
    and the kernel crashing immediately later because it has assumed
    otherwise.
    
    Reproduction of the oops-causing bug described here:
    
        https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/8/30/50
    
    Rge ussue originated in commit 2aa362c49c31 ("coredump: extend core dump
    note section to contain file names of mapped file") from Oct 4, 2012.
    
    This patch make that section optional in that case.  fill_files_note()
    should signify the error, and also let the info struct in
    elf_core_dump() be zero-initialized so that we can check for the
    optionally written note.

    requirement that when switching from Bias active + override active
    mode(FBB/RBB) to Bypass(nominal) mode, LDO reset must be performed
    *after* LDO transitions to Bypass(nominal) mode.
    
    The same rule in reverse applies when switching from a ABB bypass mode
    to ABB enabled - LDO override *must* be performed prior to transition to
    required ABB mode, if we do not do that, the same glitch takes place.
    
    Currently while transitioning to ABB bypass, we reset the LDO overide
    prior to the transition which causes a few milliseconds where ABB LDO
    voltage could go all the way to 800mV(based on SoC process node),
    during this period, the delta voltage between VDD rail and VBB rail
    could cause the system to improperly function.

    avr32: fix clockevents kernel warning
    
    commit 1b0135b5e20c56b2edae29e92b91c0b12c983432 upstream.
    
    Since commit 01426478df3a8791ff5c8b6b82d409e699cfaf38
    (avr32: Use generic idle loop) the kernel throws the
    following warning on avr32:

    When the 'avr32_comparator' clockevent device is registered,
    the clockevent core sets the mode of that clockevent device
    to CLOCK_EVT_MODE_SHUTDOWN. Due to this, the 'comparator_mode'
    function calls the 'cpu_idle_poll_ctrl' to disables idle poll.
    This results in the aforementioned warning because the polling
    is not enabled yet.
    
    Change the code to only disable idle poll if it is enabled by
    the same function to avoid the warning.

    ll_temac: Reset dma descriptors indexes on ndo_open
    
    [ Upstream commit 7167cf0e8cd10287b7912b9ffcccd9616f382922 ]
    
    The dma descriptors indexes are only initialized on the probe function.
    
    If a packet is on the buffer when temac_stop is called, the dma
    descriptors indexes can be left on a incorrect state where no other
    package can be sent.
    
    So an interface could be left in an usable state after ifdow/ifup.
    
    This patch makes sure that the descriptors indexes are in a proper
    status when the device is open.

    bonding: Fix broken promiscuity reference counting issue
    
    [ Upstream commit 5a0068deb611109c5ba77358be533f763f395ee4 ]
    
    Recently grabbed this report:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1005567
    
    Of an issue in which the bonding driver, with an attached vlan encountered the
    following errors when bond0 was taken down and back up:
    
    dummy1: promiscuity touches roof, set promiscuity failed. promiscuity feature of
    device might be broken.
    
    The error occurs because, during __bond_release_one, if we release our last
    slave, we take on a random mac address and issue a NETDEV_CHANGEADDR
    notification.  With an attached vlan, the vlan may see that the vlan and bond
    mac address were in sync, but no longer are.  This triggers a call to dev_uc_add
    and dev_set_rx_mode, which enables IFF_PROMISC on the bond device.  Then, when
    we complete __bond_release_one, we use the current state of the bond flags to
    determine if we should decrement the promiscuity of the releasing slave.  But
    since the bond changed promiscuity state during the release operation, we
    incorrectly decrement the slave promisc count when it wasn't in promiscuous mode
    to begin with, causing the above error
    
    Fix is pretty simple, just cache the bonding flags at the start of the function
    and use those when determining the need to set promiscuity.
    
    This is also needed for the ALLMULTI flag

    ipv6: udp packets following an UFO enqueued packet need also be handled by UFO
    
    [ Upstream commit 2811ebac2521ceac84f2bdae402455baa6a7fb47 ]
    
    In the following scenario the socket is corked:
    If the first UDP packet is larger then the mtu we try to append it to the
    write queue via ip6_ufo_append_data. A following packet, which is smaller
    than the mtu would be appended to the already queued up gso-skb via
    plain ip6_append_data. This causes random memory corruptions.
    
    In ip6_ufo_append_data we also have to be careful to not queue up the
    same skb multiple times. So setup the gso frame only when no first skb
    is available.
    
    This also fixes a shortcoming where we add the current packet's length to
    cork->length but return early because of a packet > mtu with dontfrag set
    (instead of sutracting it again).

    pci_unmap_single and fixes the warning. It copies the old descriptor to
    on-stack variable "ee" and unmaps it if mapping of the new descriptor
    succeeded.
    
    This patch should be backported to 3.11-stable.

    ip: generate unique IP identificator if local fragmentation is allowed
    
    [ Upstream commit 703133de331a7a7df47f31fb9de51dc6f68a9de8 ]
    
    If local fragmentation is allowed, then ip_select_ident() and
    ip_select_ident_more() need to generate unique IDs to ensure
    correct defragmentation on the peer.
    
    For example, if IPsec (tunnel mode) has to encrypt large skbs
    that have local_df bit set, then all IP fragments that belonged
    to different ESP datagrams would have used the same identificator.
    If one of these IP fragments would get lost or reordered, then
    peer could possibly stitch together wrong IP fragments that did
    not belong to the same datagram. This would lead to a packet loss
    or data corruption.

    [ Upstream commit 27082ee1b92f4d41e78b85fe40f6ab39673fba00 ]
    
    copying large files to a NFS mounted host was taking absurdly large
    time.
    
    Turns out that TX BD reclaim had a sublte bug.
    
    Loop starts off from @txbd_dirty cursor and stops when it hits a BD
    still in use by controller. However when it stops it needs to keep the
    cursor at that very BD to resume scanning in next iteration. However it
    was erroneously incrementing the cursor, causing the next scan(s) to
    fail too, unless the BD chain was completely drained out.

    net: sctp: rfc4443: do not report ICMP redirects to user space
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f96a532113131d5a65ac9e00fc83cfa31b0295f ]
    
    Adapt the same behaviour for SCTP as present in TCP for ICMP redirect
    messages. For IPv6, RFC4443, section 2.4. says:
    
      ...
      (e) An ICMPv6 error message MUST NOT be originated as a result of
          receiving the following:
      ...
           (e.2) An ICMPv6 redirect message [IPv6-DISC].
      ...
    
    Therefore, do not report an error to user space, just invoke dst's redirect
    callback and leave, same for IPv4 as done in TCP as well. The implication
    w/o having this patch could be that the reception of such packets would
    generate a poll notification and in worst case it could even tear down the
    whole connection. Therefore, stop updating sk_err on redirects.

    bridge: fix NULL pointer deref of br_port_get_rcu
    
    [ Upstream commit 716ec052d2280d511e10e90ad54a86f5b5d4dcc2 ]
    
    The NULL deref happens when br_handle_frame is called between these
    2 lines of del_nbp:
            dev->priv_flags &= ~IFF_BRIDGE_PORT;
            /* --> br_handle_frame is called at this time */
            netdev_rx_handler_unregister(dev);
    
    In br_handle_frame the return of br_port_get_rcu(dev) is dereferenced
    without check but br_port_get_rcu(dev) returns NULL if:
            !(dev->priv_flags & IFF_BRIDGE_PORT)
    
    Eric Dumazet pointed out the testing of IFF_BRIDGE_PORT is not necessary
    here since we're in rcu_read_lock and we have synchronize_net() in
    netdev_rx_handler_unregister. So remove the testing of IFF_BRIDGE_PORT
    and by the previous patch, make sure br_port_get_rcu is called in
    bridging code.

    bridge: Clamp forward_delay when enabling STP
    
    [ Upstream commit be4f154d5ef0ca147ab6bcd38857a774133f5450 ]
    
    At some point limits were added to forward_delay.  However, the
    limits are only enforced when STP is enabled.  This created a
    scenario where you could have a value outside the allowed range
    while STP is disabled, which then stuck around even after STP
    is enabled.
    
    This patch fixes this by clamping the value when we enable STP.
    
    I had to move the locking around a bit to ensure that there is
    no window where someone could insert a value outside the range
    while we're in the middle of enabling STP.

    xen-netback: count number required slots for an skb more carefully
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e43fc04a6bc357d260583b8440882f28069207f ]
    
    When a VM is providing an iSCSI target and the LUN is used by the
    backend domain, the generated skbs for direct I/O writes to the disk
    have large, multi-page skb->data but no frags.
    
    With some lengths and starting offsets, xen_netbk_count_skb_slots()
    would be one short because the simple calculation of
    DIV_ROUND_UP(skb_headlen(), PAGE_SIZE) was not accounting for the
    decisions made by start_new_rx_buffer() which does not guarantee
    responses are fully packed.
    
    For example, a skb with length < 2 pages but which spans 3 pages would
    be counted as requiring 2 slots but would actually use 3 slots.
    
    skb->data:
    
        |        1111|222222222222|3333        |
    
    Fully packed, this would need 2 slots:
    
        |111122222222|22223333    |
    
    But because the 2nd page wholy fits into a slot it is not split across
    slots and goes into a slot of its own:
    
        |1111        |222222222222|3333        |
    
    Miscounting the number of slots means netback may push more responses
    than the number of available requests.  This will cause the frontend
    to get very confused and report "Too many frags/slots".  The frontend
    never recovers and will eventually BUG.
    
    Fix this by counting the number of required slots more carefully.  In
    xen_netbk_count_skb_slots(), more closely follow the algorithm used by
    xen_netbk_gop_skb() by introducing xen_netbk_count_frag_slots() which
    is the dry-run equivalent of netbk_gop_frag_copy().

    net: sctp: fix ipv6 ipsec encryption bug in sctp_v6_xmit
    
    [ Upstream commit 95ee62083cb6453e056562d91f597552021e6ae7 ]
    
    Alan Chester reported an issue with IPv6 on SCTP that IPsec traffic is not
    being encrypted, whereas on IPv4 it is. Setting up an AH + ESP transport
    does not seem to have the desired effect:
    
    SCTP + IPv4:
    
      22:14:20.809645 IP (tos 0x2,ECT(0), ttl 64, id 0, offset 0, flags [DF], proto AH (51), length 116)
        192.168.0.2 > 192.168.0.5: AH(spi=0x00000042,sumlen=16,seq=0x1): ESP(spi=0x00000044,seq=0x1), length 72
      22:14:20.813270 IP (tos 0x2,ECT(0), ttl 64, id 0, offset 0, flags [DF], proto AH (51), length 340)
        192.168.0.5 > 192.168.0.2: AH(spi=0x00000043,sumlen=16,seq=0x1):
    
    SCTP + IPv6:
    
      22:31:19.215029 IP6 (class 0x02, hlim 64, next-header SCTP (132) payload length: 364)
        fe80::222:15ff:fe87:7fc.3333 > fe80::92e6:baff:fe0d:5a54.36767: sctp
        1) [INIT ACK] [init tag: 747759530] [rwnd: 62464] [OS: 10] [MIS: 10]
    
    Moreover, Alan says:
    
      This problem was seen with both Racoon and Racoon2. Other people have seen
      this with OpenSwan. When IPsec is configured to encrypt all upper layer
      protocols the SCTP connection does not initialize. After using Wireshark to
      follow packets, this is because the SCTP packet leaves Box A unencrypted and
      Box B believes all upper layer protocols are to be encrypted so it drops
      this packet, causing the SCTP connection to fail to initialize. When IPsec
      is configured to encrypt just SCTP, the SCTP packets are observed unencrypted.
    
    In fact, using `socat sctp6-listen:3333 -` on one end and transferring "plaintext"
    string on the other end, results in cleartext on the wire where SCTP eventually
    does not report any errors, thus in the latter case that Alan reports, the
    non-paranoid user might think he's communicating over an encrypted transport on
    SCTP although he's not (tcpdump ... -X):
    
      ...
      0x0030: 5d70 8e1a 0003 001a 177d eb6c 0000 0000  ]p.......}.l....
      0x0040: 0000 0000 706c 6169 6e74 6578 740a 0000  ....plaintext...
    
    Only in /proc/net/xfrm_stat we can see XfrmInTmplMismatch increasing on the
    receiver side. Initial follow-up analysis from Alan's bug report was done by
    Alexey Dobriyan. Also thanks to Vlad Yasevich for feedback on this.
    
    SCTP has its own implementation of sctp_v6_xmit() not calling inet6_csk_xmit().
    This has the implication that it probably never really got updated along with
    changes in inet6_csk_xmit() and therefore does not seem to invoke xfrm handlers.
    
    SCTP's IPv4 xmit however, properly calls ip_queue_xmit() to do the work. Since
    a call to inet6_csk_xmit() would solve this problem, but result in unecessary
    route lookups, let us just use the cached flowi6 instead that we got through
    sctp_v6_get_dst(). Since all SCTP packets are being sent through sctp_packet_transmit(),
    we do the route lookup / flow caching in sctp_transport_route(), hold it in
    tp->dst and skb_dst_set() right after that. If we would alter fl6->daddr in
    sctp_v6_xmit() to np->opt->srcrt, we possibly could run into the same effect
    of not having xfrm layer pick it up, hence, use fl6_update_dst() in sctp_v6_get_dst()
    instead to get the correct source routed dst entry, which we assign to the skb.
    
    Also source address routing example from 625034113 ("sctp: fix sctp to work with
    ipv6 source address routing") still works with this patch! Nevertheless, in RFC5095
    it is actually 'recommended' to not use that anyway due to traffic amplification [1].
    So it seems we're not supposed to do that anyway in sctp_v6_xmit(). Moreover, if
    we overwrite the flow destination here, the lower IPv6 layer will be unable to
    put the correct destination address into IP header, as routing header is added in
    ipv6_push_nfrag_opts() but then probably with wrong final destination. Things aside,
    result of this patch is that we do not have any XfrmInTmplMismatch increase plus on

    This fixes Kernel Bugzilla 24412. This security issue seems to be present since

    its fun with that. lksctp-tools IPv6 regression test suite passes as well with
    this patch.

    (tuntap: multiqueue support) only call free_netdev() on error in
    tun_set_iff(). This causes several issues:
    
    - memory of tun security were leaked
    - use after free since the flow gc timer was not deleted and the tfile
      were not detached
    
    This patch solves the above issues.

    netpoll: fix NULL pointer dereference in netpoll_cleanup
    
    [ Upstream commit d0fe8c888b1fd1a2f84b9962cabcb98a70988aec ]
    
    I've been hitting a NULL ptr deref while using netconsole because the
    np->dev check and the pointer manipulation in netpoll_cleanup are done
    without rtnl and the following sequence happens when having a netconsole
    over a vlan and we remove the vlan while disabling the netconsole:
            CPU 1                                   CPU2
                                            removes vlan and calls the notifier
    enters store_enabled(), calls
    netdev_cleanup which checks np->dev
    and then waits for rtnl
                                            executes the netconsole netdev
                                            release notifier making np->dev
                                            == NULL and releases rtnl
    continues to dereference a member of
    np->dev which at this point is == NULL

    net: sctp: fix smatch warning in sctp_send_asconf_del_ip
    
    [ Upstream commit 88362ad8f9a6cea787420b57cc27ccacef000dbe ]
    
    This was originally reported in [1] and posted by Neil Horman [2], he said:
    
      Fix up a missed null pointer check in the asconf code. If we don't find
      a local address, but we pass in an address length of more than 1, we may
      dereference a NULL laddr pointer. Currently this can't happen, as the only
      users of the function pass in the value 1 as the addrcnt parameter, but
      its not hot path, and it doesn't hurt to check for NULL should that ever
      be the case.
    
    The callpath from sctp_asconf_mgmt() looks okay. But this could be triggered
    from sctp_setsockopt_bindx() call with SCTP_BINDX_REM_ADDR and addrcnt > 1
    while passing all possible addresses from the bind list to SCTP_BINDX_REM_ADDR
    so that we do *not* find a single address in the association's bind address
    list that is not in the packed array of addresses. If this happens when we
    have an established association with ASCONF-capable peers, then we could get
    a NULL pointer dereference as we only check for laddr == NULL && addrcnt == 1
    and call later sctp_make_asconf_update_ip() with NULL laddr.
    
    BUT: this actually won't happen as sctp_bindx_rem() will catch such a case
    and return with an error earlier. As this is incredably unintuitive and error
    prone, add a check to catch at least future bugs here. As Neil says, its not
    hot path. Introduced by 8a07eb0a5 ("sctp: Add ASCONF operation on the
    single-homed host").

    net: fib: fib6_add: fix potential NULL pointer dereference
    
    [ Upstream commit ae7b4e1f213aa659aedf9c6ecad0bf5f0476e1e2 ]
    
    When the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_IPV6_SUBTREES, and we return
    with an error in fn = fib6_add_1(), then error codes are encoded into
    the return pointer e.g. ERR_PTR(-ENOENT). In such an error case, we
    write the error code into err and jump to out, hence enter the if(err)
    condition. Now, if CONFIG_IPV6_SUBTREES is enabled, we check for:
    
      if (pn != fn && pn->leaf == rt)
        ...
      if (pn != fn && !pn->leaf && !(pn->fn_flags & RTN_RTINFO))
        ...
    
    Since pn is NULL and fn is f.e. ERR_PTR(-ENOENT), then pn != fn
    evaluates to true and causes a NULL-pointer dereference on further
    checks on pn. Fix it, by setting both NULL in error case, so that
    pn != fn already evaluates to false and no further dereference
    takes place.
    
    This was first correctly implemented in 4a287eba2 ("IPv6 routing,
    NLM_F_* flag support: REPLACE and EXCL flags support, warn about
    missing CREATE flag"), but the bug got later on introduced by
    188c517a0 ("ipv6: return errno pointers consistently for fib6_add_1()").

    sh_eth: fix napi_{en|dis}able() calls racing against interrupts
    
    [ Upstream commit d2779e99468fd83ef1493c34f3803fec9aad8345 ]
    
    While implementing NAPI for the driver, I overlooked the race conditions where
    interrupt  handler might have called napi_schedule_prep() before napi_enable()
    was called or after napi_disable() was called. If RX interrupt happens, this
    would cause the endless interrupts and messages like:
    
    sh-eth eth0: ignoring interrupt, status 0x00040000, mask 0x01ff009f.
    
    The interrupt wouldn't even be masked by the kernel eventually since the handler
    would return IRQ_HANDLED all the time.
    
    As a fix, move napi_enable() call before request_irq() call and napi_disable()
    call after free_irq() call.

    HID: fix data access in implement()
    
    commit 27ce405039bfe6d3f4143415c638f56a3df77dca upstream.
    
    implement() is setting bytes in LE data stream. In case the data is not
    aligned to 64bits, it reads past the allocated buffer. It doesn't really
    change any value there (it's properly bitmasked), but in case that this
    read past the boundary hits a page boundary, pagefault happens when
    accessing 64bits of 'x' in implement(), and kernel oopses.
    
    This happens much more often when numbered reports are in use, as the
    initial 8bit skip in the buffer makes the whole process work on values
    which are not aligned to 64bits.
    
    This problem dates back to attempts in 2005 and 2006 to make implement()
    and extract() as generic as possible, and even back then the problem
    was realized by Adam Kroperlin, but falsely assumed to be impossible
    to cause any harm:

    I have made several attempts at fixing it "on the spot" directly in
    implement(), but the results were horrible; the special casing for processing
    last 64bit chunk and switching to different math makes it unreadable mess.
    
    I therefore took a path to allocate a few bytes more which will never make
    it into final report, but are there as a cushion for all the 64bit math
    operations happening in implement() and extract().
    
    All callers of hid_output_report() are converted at the same time to allocate
    the buffer by newly introduced hid_alloc_report_buf() helper.
    
    Bruno noticed that the whole raw_size test can be dropped as well, as
    hid_alloc_report_buf() makes sure that the buffer is always of a proper
    size.

    cciss: fix info leak in cciss_ioctl32_passthru()
    
    commit 58f09e00ae095e46ef9edfcf3a5fd9ccdfad065e upstream.
    
    The arg64 struct has a hole after ->buf_size which isn't cleared.  Or if
    any of the calls to copy_from_user() fail then that would cause an
    information leak as well.
    
    This was assigned CVE-2013-2147.

    cpqarray: fix info leak in ida_locked_ioctl()
    
    commit 627aad1c01da6f881e7f98d71fd928ca0c316b1a upstream.
    
    The pciinfo struct has a two byte hole after ->dev_fn so stack
    information could be leaked to the user.
    
    This was assigned CVE-2013-2147.

    nfsd4: fix leak of inode reference on delegation failure
    
    commit bf7bd3e98be5c74813bee6ad496139fb0a011b3b upstream.
    
    This fixes a regression from 68a3396178e6688ad7367202cdf0af8ed03c8727
    "nfsd4: shut down more of delegation earlier".
    
    After that commit, nfs4_set_delegation() failures result in
    nfs4_put_delegation being called, but nfs4_put_delegation doesn't free
    the nfs4_file that has already been set by alloc_init_deleg().
    
    This can result in an oops on later unmounting the exported filesystem.
    
    Note also delaying the fi_had_conflict check we're able to return a
    better error (hence give 4.1 clients a better idea why the delegation
    failed; though note CONFLICT isn't an exact match here, as that's
    supposed to indicate a current conflict, but all we know here is that
    there was one recently).
