    tipc: improve size validations for received domain records
    
    commit 9aa422ad326634b76309e8ff342c246800621216 upstream.
    
    The function tipc_mon_rcv() allows a node to receive and process
    domain_record structs from peer nodes to track their views of the
    network topology.
    
    This patch verifies that the number of members in a received domain
    record does not exceed the limit defined by MAX_MON_DOMAIN, something
    that may otherwise lead to a stack overflow.
    
    tipc_mon_rcv() is called from the function tipc_link_proto_rcv(), where
    we are reading a 32 bit message data length field into a uint16.  To
    avert any risk of bit overflow, we add an extra sanity check for this in
    that function.  We cannot see that happen with the current code, but
    future designers being unaware of this risk, may introduce it by
    allowing delivery of very large (> 64k) sk buffers from the bearer
    layer.  This potential problem was identified by Eric Dumazet.
    
    This fixes CVE-2022-0435

    moxart: fix potential use-after-free on remove path
    
    commit bd2db32e7c3e35bd4d9b8bbff689434a50893546 upstream.
    
    It was reported that the mmc host structure could be accessed after it
    was freed in moxart_remove(), so fix this by saving the base register of
    the device and using it instead of the pointer dereference.
