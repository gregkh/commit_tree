    crypto: algif_hash - avoid zero-sized array
    
    commit 6207119444595d287b1e9e83a2066c17209698f3 upstream.
    
    With this reproducer:
      struct sockaddr_alg alg = {
              .salg_family = 0x26,
              .salg_type = "hash",
              .salg_feat = 0xf,
              .salg_mask = 0x5,
              .salg_name = "digest_null",
      };
      int sock, sock2;
    
      sock = socket(AF_ALG, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);
      bind(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&alg, sizeof(alg));
      sock2 = accept(sock, NULL, NULL);
      setsockopt(sock, SOL_ALG, ALG_SET_KEY, "\x9b\xca", 2);
      accept(sock2, NULL, NULL);
    
    ==== 8< ======== 8< ======== 8< ======== 8< ====
    
    one can immediatelly see an UBSAN warning:
    UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in crypto/algif_hash.c:187:7

    It is a correct warning, as hash state is propagated to accept as zero,
    but creating a zero-length variable array is not allowed in C.
    
    Fix this as proposed by Herbert -- do "?: 1" on that site. No sizeof or
    similar happens in the code there, so we just allocate one byte even
    though we do not use the array.

    fbcon: Fix vc attr at deinit
    
    commit 8aac7f34369726d1a158788ae8aff3002d5eb528 upstream.
    
    fbcon can deal with vc_hi_font_mask (the upper 256 chars) and adjust
    the vc attrs dynamically when vc_hi_font_mask is changed at
    fbcon_init().  When the vc_hi_font_mask is set, it remaps the attrs in
    the existing console buffer with one bit shift up (for 9 bits), while
    it remaps with one bit shift down (for 8 bits) when the value is
    cleared.  It works fine as long as the font gets updated after fbcon
    was initialized.
    
    However, we hit a bizarre problem when the console is switched to
    another fb driver (typically from vesafb or efifb to drmfb).  At
    switching to the new fb driver, we temporarily rebind the console to
    the dummy console, then rebind to the new driver.  During the
    switching, we leave the modified attrs as is.  Thus, the new fbcon
    takes over the old buffer as if it were to contain 8 bits chars
    (although the attrs are still shifted for 9 bits), and effectively
    this results in the yellow color texts instead of the original white
    color, as found in the bugzilla entry below.
    
    An easy fix for this is to re-adjust the attrs before leaving the
    fbcon at con_deinit callback.  Since the code to adjust the attrs is
    already present in the current fbcon code, in this patch, we simply
    factor out the relevant code, and call it from fbcon_deinit().

    drm: reference count event->completion
    
    commit 24835e442f289813aa568d142a755672a740503c upstream.
    
    When writing the generic nonblocking commit code I assumed that
    through clever lifetime management I can assure that the completion
    (stored in drm_crtc_commit) only gets freed after it is completed. And
    that worked.
    
    I also wanted to make nonblocking helpers resilient against driver
    bugs, by having timeouts everywhere. And that worked too.
    
    Unfortunately taking boths things together results in oopses :( Well,
    at least sometimes: What seems to happen is that the drm event hangs
    around forever stuck in limbo land. The nonblocking helpers eventually
    time out, move on and release it. Now the bug I tested all this
    against is drivers that just entirely fail to deliver the vblank
    events like they should, and in those cases the event is simply
    leaked. But what seems to happen, at least sometimes, on i915 is that
    the event is set up correctly, but somohow the vblank fails to fire in
    time. Which means the event isn't leaked, it's still there waiting for
    eventually a vblank to fire. That tends to happen when re-enabling the
    pipe, and then the trap springs and the kernel oopses.
    
    The correct fix here is simply to refcount the crtc commit to make
    sure that the event sticks around even for drivers which only
    sometimes fail to deliver vblanks for some arbitrary reasons. Since
    crtc commits are already refcounted that's easy to do.

    nl80211: fix dumpit error path RTNL deadlocks
    
    commit ea90e0dc8cecba6359b481e24d9c37160f6f524f upstream.
    
    Sowmini pointed out Dmitry's RTNL deadlock report to me, and it turns out
    to be perfectly accurate - there are various error paths that miss unlock
    of the RTNL.
    
    To fix those, change the locking a bit to not be conditional in all those
    nl80211_prepare_*_dump() functions, but make those require the RTNL to
    start with, and fix the buggy error paths. This also let me use sparse
    (by appropriately overriding the rtnl_lock/rtnl_unlock functions) to
    validate the changes.

    drm/bridge: analogix dp: Fix runtime PM state on driver bind
    
    commit f0a8b49c03d22a511a601dc54b2a3425a41e35fa upstream.
    
    Analogix_dp_bind() can be called from component framework, which doesn't
    guarantee proper runtime PM state of the device during bind operation,
    so ensure that device is runtime active before doing any register access.
    This ensures that the power domain, to which DP module belongs, is turned
    on. While at it, also fix the unbalanced call to phy_power_on() in
    analogix_dp_bind() function.
    
    This patch solves the following kernel oops on Samsung Exynos5250 Snow
    board:

    device-dax: fix pmd/pte fault fallback handling
    
    commit 0134ed4fb9e78672ee9f7b18007114404c81e63f upstream.
    
    Jeff Moyer reports:
    
        With a device dax alignment of 4KB or 2MB, I get sigbus when running
        the attached fio job file for the current kernel (4.11.0-rc1+).  If
        I specify an alignment of 1GB, it works.
    
        I turned on debug output, and saw that it was failing in the huge
        fault code.
    
         dax dax1.0: dax_open
         dax dax1.0: dax_mmap
         dax dax1.0: dax_dev_huge_fault: fio: write (0x7f08f0a00000 -
         dax dax1.0: __dax_dev_pud_fault: phys_to_pgoff(0xffffffffcf60
         dax dax1.0: dax_release
    
        fio config for reproduce:
        [global]
        ioengine=dev-dax
        direct=0
        filename=/dev/dax0.0
        bs=2m
    
        [write]
        rw=write
    
        [read]
        stonewall
        rw=read
    
    The driver fails to fallback when taking a fault that is larger than
    the device alignment, or handling a larger fault when a smaller
    mapping is already established. While we could support larger
    mappings for a device with a smaller alignment, that change is
    too large for the immediate fix. The simplest change is to force
    fallback until the fault size matches the alignment.

    libceph: don't set weight to IN when OSD is destroyed
    
    commit b581a5854eee4b7851dedb0f8c2ceb54fb902c06 upstream.
    
    Since ceph.git commit 4e28f9e63644 ("osd/OSDMap: clear osd_info,
    osd_xinfo on osd deletion"), weight is set to IN when OSD is deleted.
    This changes the result of applying an incremental for clients, not
    just OSDs.  Because CRUSH computations are obviously affected,
    pre-4e28f9e63644 servers disagree with post-4e28f9e63644 clients on
    object placement, resulting in misdirected requests.
    
    Mirrors ceph.git commit a6009d1039a55e2c77f431662b3d6cc5a8e8e63f.

    commit e609ccef5222c73b46b322be7d3796d60bff353d upstream.
    
    Output 'activation' may fail for the reasons of the output driver,
    for example, if msc's buffer is not allocated. We forget, however,
    to drop the module reference in this case. So each attempt at
    activation in this case leaks a reference, preventing the module
    from ever unloading.
    
    This patch adds the missing module_put() in the activation error

    blk-mq: don't complete un-started request in timeout handler
    
    commit 95a49603707d982b25d17c5b70e220a05556a2f9 upstream.
    
    When iterating busy requests in timeout handler,
    if the STARTED flag of one request isn't set, that means
    the request is being processed in block layer or driver, and
    isn't submitted to hardware yet.
    
    In current implementation of blk_mq_check_expired(),
    if the request queue becomes dying, un-started requests are
    handled as being completed/freed immediately. This way is
    wrong, and can cause rq corruption or double allocation[1][2],
    when doing I/O and removing&resetting NVMe device at the sametime.
    
    This patch fixes several issues reported by Yi Zhang.

    cgroup, net_cls: iterate the fds of only the tasks which are being migrated
    
    commit a05d4fd9176003e0c1f9c3d083f4dac19fd346ab upstream.
    
    The net_cls controller controls the classid field of each socket which
    is associated with the cgroup.  Because the classid is per-socket
    attribute, when a task migrates to another cgroup or the configured
    classid of the cgroup changes, the controller needs to walk all
    sockets and update the classid value, which was implemented by
    3b13758f51de ("cgroups: Allow dynamically changing net_classid").
    
    While the approach is not scalable, migrating tasks which have a lot
    of fds attached to them is rare and the cost is born by the ones
    initiating the operations.  However, for simplicity, both the
    migration and classid config change paths call update_classid() which
    scans all fds of all tasks in the target css.  This is an overkill for
    the migration path which only needs to cover a much smaller subset of
    tasks which are actually getting migrated in.
    
    On cgroup v1, this can lead to unexpected scalability issues when one
    tries to migrate a task or process into a net_cls cgroup which already
    contains a lot of fds.  Even if the migration traget doesn't have many
    to get scanned, update_classid() ends up scanning all fds in the
    target cgroup which can be extremely numerous.
    
    Unfortunately, on cgroup v2 which doesn't use net_cls, the problem is
    even worse.  Before bfc2cf6f61fc ("cgroup: call subsys->*attach() only
    for subsystems which are actually affected by migration"), cgroup core
    would call the ->css_attach callback even for controllers which don't
    see actual migration to a different css.
    
    As net_cls is always disabled but still mounted on cgroup v2, whenever
    a process is migrated on the cgroup v2 hierarchy, net_cls sees
    identity migration from root to root and cgroup core used to call
    ->css_attach callback for those.  The net_cls ->css_attach ends up
    calling update_classid() on the root net_cls css to which all
    processes on the system belong to as the controller isn't used.  This
    makes any cgroup v2 migration O(total_number_of_fds_on_the_system)
    which is horrible and easily leads to noticeable stalls triggering RCU
    stall warnings and so on.
    
    The worst symptom is already fixed in upstream by bfc2cf6f61fc
    ("cgroup: call subsys->*attach() only for subsystems which are
    actually affected by migration"); however, backporting that commit is
    too invasive and we want to avoid other cases too.
    
    This patch updates net_cls's cgrp_attach() to iterate fds of only the
    processes which are actually getting migrated.  This removes the
    surprising migration cost which is dependent on the total number of
    fds in the target cgroup.  As this leaves write_classid() the only
    user of update_classid(), open-code the helper into write_classid().

    cpufreq: Restore policy min/max limits on CPU online
    
    commit ff010472fb75670cb5c08671e820eeea3af59c87 upstream.
    
    On CPU online the cpufreq core restores the previous governor (or
    the previous "policy" setting for ->setpolicy drivers), but it does
    not restore the min/max limits at the same time, which is confusing,
    inconsistent and real pain for users who set the limits and then
    suspend/resume the system (using full suspend), in which case the
    limits are reset on all CPUs except for the boot one.
    
    Fix this by making cpufreq_online() restore the limits when an inactive
    policy is brought online.
    
    The commit log and patch are inspired from Rafael's earlier work.

    arm64: kaslr: Fix up the kernel image alignment
    
    commit afd0e5a876703accb95894f23317a13e2c49b523 upstream.
    
    If kernel image extends across alignment boundary, existing
    code increases the KASLR offset by size of kernel image. The
    offset is masked after resizing. There are cases, where after
    masking, we may still have kernel image extending across
    boundary. This eventually results in only 2MB block getting
    mapped while creating the page tables. This results in data aborts
    while accessing unmapped regions during second relocation (with
    kaslr offset) in __primary_switch. To fix this problem, round up the
    kernel image size, by swapper block size, before adding it for
    correction.
    
    For example consider below case, where kernel image still crosses
    1GB alignment boundary, after masking the offset, which is fixed
    by rounding up kernel image size.
    
    SWAPPER_TABLE_SHIFT = 30
    Swapper using section maps with section size 2MB.
    CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS = 3
    VA_BITS = 39
    
    _text  : 0xffffff8008080000
    _end   : 0xffffff800aa1b000
    offset : 0x1f35600000
    mask = ((1UL << (VA_BITS - 2)) - 1) & ~(SZ_2M - 1)
    
    (_text + offset) >> SWAPPER_TABLE_SHIFT = 0x3fffffe7c
    (_end + offset) >> SWAPPER_TABLE_SHIFT  = 0x3fffffe7d
    
    offset after existing correction (before mask) = 0x1f37f9b000
    (_text + offset) >> SWAPPER_TABLE_SHIFT = 0x3fffffe7d
    (_end + offset) >> SWAPPER_TABLE_SHIFT  = 0x3fffffe7d
    
    offset (after mask) = 0x1f37e00000
    (_text + offset) >> SWAPPER_TABLE_SHIFT = 0x3fffffe7c
    (_end + offset) >> SWAPPER_TABLE_SHIFT  = 0x3fffffe7d
    
    new offset w/ rounding up = 0x1f38000000
    (_text + offset) >> SWAPPER_TABLE_SHIFT = 0x3fffffe7d
    (_end + offset) >> SWAPPER_TABLE_SHIFT  = 0x3fffffe7d

    ARM: at91: pm: cpu_idle: switch DDR to power-down mode
    
    commit 60b89f1928af80b546b5c3fd8714a62f6f4b8844 upstream.
    
    On some DDR controllers, compatible with the sama5d3 one,
    the sequence to enter/exit/re-enter the self-refresh mode adds
    more constrains than what is currently written in the at91_idle
    driver. An actual access to the DDR chip is needed between exit
    and re-enter of this mode which is somehow difficult to implement.
    This sequence can completely hang the SoC. It is particularly
    experienced on parts which embed a L2 cache if the code run
    between IDLE calls fits in it...
    
    Moreover, as the intention is to enter and exit pretty rapidly
    from IDLE, the power-down mode is a good candidate.
    
    So now we use power-down instead of self-refresh. As we can
    simplify the code for sama5d3 compatible DDR controllers,
    we instantiate a new sama5d3_ddr_standby() function.

    Revert "ARM: at91/dt: sama5d2: Use new compatible for ohci node"
    
    commit 9e10889a3177340dcda7d29c6d8fbd97247b007b upstream.
    
    This reverts commit cab43282682e ("ARM: at91/dt: sama5d2: Use new
    compatible for ohci node")
    
    It depends from commit 7150bc9b4d43 ("usb: ohci-at91: Forcibly suspend
    ports while USB suspend") which was reverted and implemented
    differently. With the new implementation, the compatible string must
    remain the same.
    
    The compatible string introduced by this commit has been used in the
    default SAMA5D2 dtsi starting from Linux 4.8. As it has never been
    working correctly in an official release, removing it should not be
    breaking the stability rules.

    iommu/vt-d: Fix NULL pointer dereference in device_to_iommu
    
    commit 5003ae1e735e6bfe4679d9bed6846274f322e77e upstream.

    xen/acpi: upload PM state from init-domain to Xen
    
    commit 1914f0cd203c941bba72f9452c8290324f1ef3dc upstream.
    
    This was broken in commit cd979883b9ed ("xen/acpi-processor:
    fix enabling interrupts on syscore_resume"). do_suspend (from
    xen/manage.c) and thus xen_resume_notifier never get called on
    the initial-domain at resume (it is if running as guest.)
    
    The rationale for the breaking change was that upload_pm_data()
    potentially does blocking work in syscore_resume(). This patch
    addresses the original issue by scheduling upload_pm_data() to
    execute in workqueue context.

    crypto: ccp - Assign DMA commands to the channel's CCP
    
    commit 7c468447f40645fbf2a033dfdaa92b1957130d50 upstream.
    
    The CCP driver generally uses a round-robin approach when
    assigning operations to available CCPs. For the DMA engine,
    however, the DMA mappings of the SGs are associated with a
    specific CCP. When an IOMMU is enabled, the IOMMU is
    programmed based on this specific device.
    
    If the DMA operations are not performed by that specific
    CCP then addressing errors and I/O page faults will occur.
    
    Update the CCP driver to allow a specific CCP device to be
    requested for an operation and use this in the DMA engine
    support.

    When PCIe FLR support was added, much of the remove/release code for
    PCIe was migrated to ->down_dev(), but ->down_dev() is never called for
    device removal. Let's refactor the cleanup to be done in both cases.
    
    Also, drop the comments above mwifiex_cleanup_pcie(), because they were
    clearly wrong, and it's better to have clear and obvious code than to
    detail the code steps in comments anyway.

    commit ac8616e4c81dded650dfade49a7da283565d37ce upstream.
    
    The MP style clocks support an mux with pre-dividers. While the driver
    correctly accounted for them in the .determine_rate callback, it did
    not in the .recalc_rate and .set_rate callbacks.
    
    This means when calculating the factors in the .set_rate callback, they
    would be off by a factor of the active pre-divider. Same goes for
    reading back the clock rate after it is set.

    commit 69db7009318758769d625b023402161c750f7876 upstream.
    
    After commit 31b2a73c9c5f ("hwrng: amd - Migrate to managed API"), the

    mmc: sdhci-pci: Do not disable interrupts in sdhci_intel_set_power
    
    commit 027fb89e61054b4aedd962adb3e2003dec78a716 upstream.
    
    Disabling interrupts for even a millisecond can cause problems for some
    devices. That can happen when Intel host controllers wait for the present
    state to propagate.
    
    The spin lock is not necessary here. Anything that is racing with changes
    to the I/O state is already broken. The mmc core already provides
    synchronization via "claiming" the host.
    
    Although the spin lock probably should be removed from the code paths that
    lead to this point, such a patch would touch too much code to be suitable
    for stable trees. Consequently, for this patch, just drop the spin lock
    while waiting.

    mmc: sdhci-of-arasan: fix incorrect timeout clock
    
    commit 16681037e75ce08f2980ac5dbb03414429c7a55d upstream.
    
    sdhci_arasan_get_timeout_clock() divides the frequency it has with (1 <<
    (13 + divisor)).
    
    However, the divisor is not some Arasan-specific value, but instead is
    just the Data Timeout Counter Value from the SDHCI Timeout Control
    Register.
    
    Applying it here like this is wrong as the sdhci driver already takes
    that value into account when calculating timeouts, and in fact it *sets*
    that register value based on how long a timeout is wanted.
    
    Additionally, sdhci core interprets the .get_timeout_clock callback
    return value as if it were read from hardware registers, i.e. the unit
    should be kHz or MHz depending on SDHCI_TIMEOUT_CLK_UNIT capability bit.
    This bit is set at least on the tested Zynq-7000 SoC.
    
    With the tested hardware (SDHCI_TIMEOUT_CLK_UNIT set) this results in
    too high a timeout clock rate being reported, causing the core to use
    longer-than-needed timeouts. Additionally, on a partitioned MMC
    (therefore having erase_group_def bit set) mmc_calc_max_discard()
    disables discard support as it looks like controller does not support
    the long timeouts needed for that.
    
    Do not apply the extra divisor and return the timeout clock in the
    expected unit.
    
    Tested with a Zynq-7000 SoC and a partitioned Toshiba THGBMAG5A1JBAWR
    eMMC card.

    commit 2ce0c7b65505e0d915e99389cced45b478dc935d upstream.
    
    The SDHCI controller in the SAMA5D2 chip requires a valid voltage set
    in the power control register, otherwise commands will fail with a
    timeout error.
    
    When using the regulator framework to specify the regulator used by the
    mmc device, the voltage is not configured, and it is not possible to use
    the connected device.
    
    Implement a custom 'set_power' function for this specific hardware, that
    configures the voltage in the register in all cases.

    powerpc/64s: Fix idle wakeup potential to clobber registers
    
    commit 6d98ce0be541d4a3cfbb52cd75072c0339ebb500 upstream.
    
    We concluded there may be a window where the idle wakeup code could get
    to pnv_wakeup_tb_loss() (which clobbers non-volatile GPRs), but the
    hardware may set SRR1[46:47] to 01b (no state loss) which would result
    in the wakeup code failing to restore non-volatile GPRs.
    
    I was not able to trigger this condition with trivial tests on real
    hardware or simulator, but the ISA (at least 2.07) seems to allow for
    it, and Gautham says that it can happen if there is an exception pending
    when the sleep/winkle instruction is executed.

    ext4: mark inode dirty after converting inline directory
    
    commit b9cf625d6ecde0d372e23ae022feead72b4228a6 upstream.
    
    If ext4_convert_inline_data() was called on a directory with inline
    data, the filesystem was left in an inconsistent state (as considered by
    e2fsck) because the file size was not increased to cover the new block.
    This happened because the inode was not marked dirty after i_disksize
    was updated.  Fix this by marking the inode dirty at the end of
    ext4_finish_convert_inline_dir().
    
    This bug was probably not noticed before because most users mark the
    inode dirty afterwards for other reasons.  But if userspace executed
    FS_IOC_SET_ENCRYPTION_POLICY with invalid parameters, as exercised by
    'kvm-xfstests -c adv generic/396', then the inode was never marked dirty
    after updating i_disksize.

    parport: fix attempt to write duplicate procfiles
    
    commit 03270c6ac6207fc55bbf9d20d195029dca210c79 upstream.
    
    Usually every parallel port will have a single pardev registered with
    it. But ppdev driver is an exception. This userspace parallel port
    driver allows to create multiple parrallel port devices for a single
    parallel port. And as a result we were having a nice warning like:
    "sysctl table check failed:
    /dev/parport/parport0/devices/ppdev0/timeslice Sysctl already exists"
    
    Use the same logic as used in parport_register_device() and register
    the proc files only once for each parallel port.

    commit 3ff861f59f6c1f5bf2bc03d2cd36ac3f992cbc06 upstream.
    
    Even if bus is not hot-pluggable, devices can be unbound from the
    driver via sysfs, so we should not be using __exit annotations on
    remove() methods. The only exception is drivers registered with
    platform_driver_probe() which specifically disables sysfs bind/unbind

    iio: hid-sensor-trigger: Change get poll value function order to avoid sensor properties losing after resume from S3
    
    commit 3bec247474469f769af41e8c80d3a100dd97dd76 upstream.
    
    In function _hid_sensor_power_state(), when hid_sensor_read_poll_value()
    is called, sensor's all properties will be updated by the value from
    sensor hardware/firmware.
    In some implementation, sensor hardware/firmware will do a power cycle
    during S3. In this case, after resume, once hid_sensor_read_poll_value()
    is called, sensor's all properties which are kept by driver during S3
    will be changed to default value.
    But instead, if a set feature function is called first, sensor
    hardware/firmware will be recovered to the last status. So change the
    sensor_hub_set_feature() calling order to behind of set feature function
    to avoid sensor properties lose.

    iio: adc: ti_am335x_adc: fix fifo overrun recovery
    
    commit e83bb3e6f3efa21f4a9d883a25d0ecd9dfb431e1 upstream.
    
    The tiadc_irq_h(int irq, void *private) function is handling FIFO
    overruns by clearing flags, disabling and enabling the ADC to
    recover.
    
    If the ADC is running in continuous mode a FIFO overrun happens
    regularly. If the disabling of the ADC happens concurrently with
    a new conversion. It might happen that the enabling of the ADC
    is ignored by the hardware. This stops the ADC permanently. No
    more interrupts are triggered.
    
    According to the AM335x Reference Manual (SPRUH73H October 2011 -
    Revised April 2013 - Chapter 12.4 and 12.5) it is necessary to
    check the ADC FSM bits in REG_ADCFSM before enabling the ADC
    again. Because the disabling of the ADC is done right after the
    current conversion has been finished.
    
    To trigger this bug it is necessary to run the ADC in continuous
    mode. The ADC values of all channels need to be read in an endless
    loop. The bug appears within the first 6 hours (~5.4 million
    handled FIFO overruns). The user space application will hang on
    reading new values from the character device.

    commit 687e0687f71ec00e0132a21fef802dee88c2f1ad upstream.
    
    USBTMC devices are required to have a bulk-in and a bulk-out endpoint,
    but the driver failed to verify this, something which could lead to the
    endpoint addresses being taken from uninitialised memory.
    
    Make sure to zero all private data as part of allocation, and add the
    missing endpoint sanity check.
    
    Note that this also addresses a more recently introduced issue, where
    the interrupt-in-presence flag would also be uninitialised whenever the
    optional interrupt-in endpoint is not present. This in turn could lead
    to an interrupt urb being allocated, initialised and submitted based on
    uninitialised values.

    Some USB 2.0 devices erroneously report millisecond values in
    bInterval. The generic config code manages to catch most of them,
    but in some cases it's not completely enough.
    
    The case at stake here is a USB 2.0 braille device, which wants to
    announce 10ms and thus sets bInterval to 10, but with the USB 2.0
    computation that yields to 64ms.  It happens that one can type fast
    enough to reach this interval and get the device buffers overflown,
    leading to problematic latencies.  The generic config code does not
    catch this case because the 64ms is considered a sane enough value.
    
    This change thus adds a USB_QUIRK_LINEAR_FRAME_INTR_BINTERVAL quirk
    to mark devices which actually report milliseconds in bInterval,
    and marks Vario Ultra devices as needing it.

    usb: gadget: f_uvc: Fix SuperSpeed companion descriptor's wBytesPerInterval
    
    commit 09424c50b7dff40cb30011c09114404a4656e023 upstream.
    
    The streaming_maxburst module parameter is 0 offset (0..15)
    so we must add 1 while using it for wBytesPerInterval
    calculation for the SuperSpeed companion descriptor.
    
    Without this host uvcvideo driver will always see the wrong
    wBytesPerInterval for SuperSpeed uvc gadget and may not find
    a suitable video interface endpoint.
    e.g. for streaming_maxburst = 0 case it will always
    fail as wBytePerInterval was evaluating to 0.

    (As a side note: although the original commit was completely wrong,
     it's still working for most of machines, as it sets to 32bit DMA mask

    ALSA: seq: Fix racy cell insertions during snd_seq_pool_done()
    
    commit c520ff3d03f0b5db7146d9beed6373ad5d2a5e0e upstream.
    
    When snd_seq_pool_done() is called, it marks the closing flag to
    refuse the further cell insertions.  But snd_seq_pool_done() itself
    doesn't clear the cells but just waits until all cells are cleared by
    the caller side.  That is, it's racy, and this leads to the endless
    stall as syzkaller spotted.
    
    This patch addresses the racy by splitting the setup of pool->closing
    flag out of snd_seq_pool_done(), and calling it properly before
    snd_seq_pool_done().

    socket, bpf: fix sk_filter use after free in sk_clone_lock
    
    [ Upstream commit a97e50cc4cb67e1e7bff56f6b41cda62ca832336 ]
    
    In sk_clone_lock(), we create a new socket and inherit most of the
    parent's members via sock_copy() which memcpy()'s various sections.
    Now, in case the parent socket had a BPF socket filter attached,
    then newsk->sk_filter points to the same instance as the original
    sk->sk_filter.
    
    sk_filter_charge() is then called on the newsk->sk_filter to take a
    reference and should that fail due to hitting max optmem, we bail
    out and release the newsk instance.
    
    The issue is that commit 278571baca2a ("net: filter: simplify socket
    charging") wrongly combined the dismantle path with the failure path
    of xfrm_sk_clone_policy(). This means, even when charging failed, we
    call sk_free_unlock_clone() on the newsk, which then still points to
    the same sk_filter as the original sk.
    
    Thus, sk_free_unlock_clone() calls into __sk_destruct() eventually
    where it tests for present sk_filter and calls sk_filter_uncharge()
    on it, which potentially lets sk_omem_alloc wrap around and releases
    the eBPF prog and sk_filter structure from the (still intact) parent.
    
    Fix it by making sure that when sk_filter_charge() failed, we reset
    newsk->sk_filter back to NULL before passing to sk_free_unlock_clone(),
    so that we don't mess with the parents sk_filter.
    
    Only if xfrm_sk_clone_policy() fails, we did reach the point where
    either the parent's filter was NULL and as a result newsk's as well
    or where we previously had a successful sk_filter_charge(), thus for
    that case, we do need sk_filter_uncharge() to release the prior taken
    reference on sk_filter.

    Commit 6ac3ce8295e6 ("net: bcmgenet: Remove excessive PHY reset")
    removed the bcmgenet_mii_reset() function from bcmgenet_power_up() and
    bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup() functions.  In so doing it broke the reset
    of the internal PHY devices used by the GENETv1-GENETv3 which required
    this reset before the UniMAC was enabled.  It also broke the internal
    GPHY devices used by the GENETv4 because the config_init that installed
    the AFE workaround was no longer occurring after the reset of the GPHY
    performed by bcmgenet_phy_power_set() in bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup().
    In addition the code in bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup() related to the
    "enable APD" comment goes with the bcmgenet_mii_reset() so it should
    have also been removed.
    
    Commit bd4060a6108b ("net: bcmgenet: Power on integrated GPHY in
    bcmgenet_power_up()") moved the bcmgenet_phy_power_set() call to the
    bcmgenet_power_up() function, but failed to remove it from the
    bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup() function.  Had it done so, the
    bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup() function would have been empty and could
    have been removed at that time.
    
    Commit 5dbebbb44a6a ("net: bcmgenet: Software reset EPHY after power on")
    was submitted to correct the functional problems introduced by
    commit 6ac3ce8295e6 ("net: bcmgenet: Remove excessive PHY reset"). It
    was included in v4.4 and made available on 4.3-stable. Unfortunately,
    it didn't fully revert the commit because this bcmgenet_mii_reset()
    doesn't apply the soft reset to the internal GPHY used by GENETv4 like
    the previous one did. This prevents the restoration of the AFE work-
    arounds for internal GPHY devices after the bcmgenet_phy_power_set() in
    bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup().
    
    This commit takes the alternate approach of removing the unnecessary
    bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup() function which shouldn't have been in v4.3
    so that when bcmgenet_mii_reset() was restored it should have only gone
    into bcmgenet_power_up().  This will avoid the problems while also
    removing the redundancy (and hopefully some of the confusion).

    [ Upstream commit 3dc857f0e8fc22610a59cbb346ba62c6e921863f ]
    
    The VRF driver takes a reference to the inet6_dev on the VRF device for
    its rt6_local dst when handling local traffic through the VRF device as
    a loopback. When the device is deleted the driver does a put on the idev
    but does not reset rt6i_idev in the rt6_info struct. When the dst is
    destroyed, dst_destroy calls ip6_dst_destroy which does a second put for
    what is essentially the same reference causing it to be prematurely freed.
    Reset rt6i_idev after the put in the vrf driver.

    net: unix: properly re-increment inflight counter of GC discarded candidates
    
    [ Upstream commit 7df9c24625b9981779afb8fcdbe2bb4765e61147 ]
    
    Dmitry has reported that a BUG_ON() condition in unix_notinflight()
    may be triggered by a simple code that forwards unix socket in an
    SCM_RIGHTS message.
    That is caused by incorrect unix socket GC implementation in unix_gc().
    
    The GC first collects list of candidates, then (a) decrements their
    "children's" inflight counter, (b) checks which inflight counters are
    now 0, and then (c) increments all inflight counters back.
    (a) and (c) are done by calling scan_children() with inc_inflight or
    dec_inflight as the second argument.
    
    Commit 6209344f5a37 ("net: unix: fix inflight counting bug in garbage
    collector") changed scan_children() such that it no longer considers
    sockets that do not have UNIX_GC_CANDIDATE flag. It also added a block
    of code that that unsets this flag _before_ invoking
    scan_children(, dec_iflight, ). This may lead to incorrect inflight
    counters for some sockets.
    
    This change fixes this bug by changing order of operations:
    UNIX_GC_CANDIDATE is now unset only after all inflight counters are
    restored to the original state.

    amd-xgbe: Fix jumbo MTU processing on newer hardware
    
    [ Upstream commit 622c36f143fc9566ba49d7cec994c2da1182d9e2 ]
    
    Newer hardware does not provide a cumulative payload length when multiple
    descriptors are needed to handle the data. Once the MTU increases beyond
    the size that can be handled by a single descriptor, the SKB does not get
    built properly by the driver.
    
    The driver will now calculate the size of the data buffers used by the
    hardware.  The first buffer of the first descriptor is for packet headers
    or packet headers and data when the headers can't be split. Subsequent
    descriptors in a multi-descriptor chain will not use the first buffer. The
    second buffer is used by all the descriptors in the chain for payload data.
    Based on whether the driver is processing the first, intermediate, or last
    descriptor it can calculate the buffer usage and build the SKB properly.
    
    Tested and verified on both old and new hardware.
