    leds: trigger: netdev: use memcpy in device_name_store
    
    [ Upstream commit 909346433064b8d840dc82af26161926b8d37558 ]
    
    If userspace doesn't end the input with a newline (which can easily
    happen if the write happens from a C program that does write(fd,
    iface, strlen(iface))), we may end up including garbage from a
    previous, longer value in the device_name. For example
    
    # cat device_name
    
    # printf 'eth12' > device_name
    # cat device_name
    eth12
    # printf 'eth3' > device_name
    # cat device_name
    eth32
    
    I highly doubt anybody is relying on this behaviour, so switch to
    simply copying the bytes (we've already checked that size is <
    IFNAMSIZ) and unconditionally zero-terminate it; of course, we also
    still have to strip a trailing newline.
    
    This is also preparation for future patches.

    ptrace: take into account saved_sigmask in PTRACE{GET,SET}SIGMASK
    
    [ Upstream commit fcfc2aa0185f4a731d05a21e9f359968fdfd02e7 ]
    
    There are a few system calls (pselect, ppoll, etc) which replace a task
    sigmask while they are running in a kernel-space
    
    When a task calls one of these syscalls, the kernel saves a current
    sigmask in task->saved_sigmask and sets a syscall sigmask.
    
    On syscall-exit-stop, ptrace traps a task before restoring the
    saved_sigmask, so PTRACE_GETSIGMASK returns the syscall sigmask and
    PTRACE_SETSIGMASK does nothing, because its sigmask is replaced by
    saved_sigmask, when the task returns to user-space.
    
    This patch fixes this problem.  PTRACE_GETSIGMASK returns saved_sigmask
    if it's set.  PTRACE_SETSIGMASK drops the TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK flag.

    If a device has an exclusion range specified in the IVRS
    table, this region needs to be reserved in the iova-domain
    of that device. This hasn't happened until now and can cause

    perf machine: Update kernel map address and re-order properly
    
    [ Upstream commit 977c7a6d1e263ff1d755f28595b99e4bc0c48a9f ]
    
    Since commit 1fb87b8e9599 ("perf machine: Don't search for active kernel
    start in __machine__create_kernel_maps"), the __machine__create_kernel_maps()
    just create a map what start and end are both zero. Though the address will be
    updated later, the order of map in the rbtree may be incorrect.
    
    The commit ee05d21791db ("perf machine: Set main kernel end address properly")
    fixed the logic in machine__create_kernel_maps(), but it's still wrong in
    function machine__process_kernel_mmap_event().
    
    To reproduce this issue, we need an environment which the module address
    is before the kernel text segment. I tested it on an aarch64 machine with
    kernel 4.19.25:

    If the call to of_gpiochip_scan_gpios() in of_gpiochip_add() fails, no
    error handling is performed.  This lead to the need of callers to call
    of_gpiochip_remove() on failure, which causes "BAD of_node_put() on ..."
    if the failure happened before the call to of_node_get().
    
    Fix this by adding proper error handling.
    
    Note that calling gpiochip_remove_pin_ranges() multiple times causes no
    harm: subsequent calls are a no-op.

    x86/mm: Don't exceed the valid physical address space
    
    [ Upstream commit 92c77f7c4d5dfaaf45b2ce19360e69977c264766 ]
    
    valid_phys_addr_range() is used to sanity check the physical address range
    of an operation, e.g., access to /dev/mem. It uses __pa(high_memory)
    internally.
    
    If memory is populated at the end of the physical address space, then
    __pa(high_memory) is outside of the physical address space because:
    
       high_memory = (void *)__va(max_pfn * PAGE_SIZE - 1) + 1;
    
    For the comparison in valid_phys_addr_range() this is not an issue, but if
    CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL is enabled, __pa() maps to __phys_addr(), which
    verifies that the resulting physical address is within the valid physical
    address space of the CPU. So in the case that memory is populated at the
    end of the physical address space, this is not true and triggers a
    VIRTUAL_BUG_ON().
    
    Use __pa(high_memory - 1) to prevent the conversion from going beyond
    the end of valid physical addresses.

    scsi: zfcp: reduce flood of fcrscn1 trace records on multi-element RSCN
    
    [ Upstream commit c8206579175c34a2546de8a74262456278a7795a ]
    
    If an incoming ELS of type RSCN contains more than one element, zfcp
    suboptimally causes repeated erp trigger NOP trace records for each
    previously failed port. These could be ports that went away.  It loops over
    each RSCN element, and for each of those in an inner loop over all
    zfcp_ports.
    
    The trigger to recover failed ports should be just the reception of some
    RSCN, no matter how many elements it has. So we can loop over failed ports
    separately, and only then loop over each RSCN element to handle the
    non-failed ports.
    
    The call chain was:
    
      zfcp_fc_incoming_rscn
        for (i = 1; i < no_entries; i++)
          _zfcp_fc_incoming_rscn
            list_for_each_entry(port, &adapter->port_list, list)
              if (masked port->d_id match) zfcp_fc_test_link
              if (!port->d_id) zfcp_erp_port_reopen "fcrscn1"   <===
    
    In order the reduce the "flooding" of the REC trace area in such cases, we
    factor out handling the failed ports to be outside of the entries loop:
    
      zfcp_fc_incoming_rscn
        if (no_entries > 1)                                     <===
          list_for_each_entry(port, &adapter->port_list, list)  <===
            if (!port->d_id) zfcp_erp_port_reopen "fcrscn1"     <===
        for (i = 1; i < no_entries; i++)
          _zfcp_fc_incoming_rscn
            list_for_each_entry(port, &adapter->port_list, list)
              if (masked port->d_id match) zfcp_fc_test_link
    
    Abbreviated example trace records before this code change:
    
    Tag            : fcrscn1
    WWPN           : 0x500507630310d327
    ERP want       : 0x02
    ERP need       : 0x02
    
    Tag            : fcrscn1
    WWPN           : 0x500507630310d327
    ERP want       : 0x02
    ERP need       : 0x00                 NOP => superfluous trace record
    
    The last trace entry repeats if there are more than 2 RSCN elements.

    leds: trigger: netdev: fix refcnt leak on interface rename
    
    [ Upstream commit 4cb6560514fa19d556954b88128f3846fee66a03 ]
    
    Renaming a netdev-trigger-tracked interface was resulting in an
    unbalanced dev_hold().
    
    Example:
    > iw phy phy0 interface add foo type __ap
    > echo netdev > trigger
    > echo foo > device_name
    > ip link set foo name bar
    > iw dev bar del
    [  237.355366] unregister_netdevice: waiting for bar to become free. Usage count = 1
    [  247.435362] unregister_netdevice: waiting for bar to become free. Usage count = 1
    [  257.545366] unregister_netdevice: waiting for bar to become free. Usage count = 1
    
    Above problem was caused by trigger checking a dev->name which obviously
    changes after renaming an interface. It meant missing all further events
    including the NETDEV_UNREGISTER which is required for calling dev_put().
    
    This change fixes that by:
    1) Comparing device struct *address* for notification-filtering purposes
    2) Dropping unneeded NETDEV_CHANGENAME code (no behavior change)

    scsi: mpt3sas: Fix kernel panic during expander reset
    
    [ Upstream commit c2fe742ff6e77c5b4fe4ad273191ddf28fdea25e ]
    
    During expander reset handling, the driver invokes kernel function
    scsi_host_find_tag() to obtain outstanding requests associated with the
    scsi host managed by the driver. Driver loops from tag value zero to hba
    queue depth to obtain the outstanding scmds. But when blk-mq is enabled,
    the block layer may return stale entry for one or more requests. This may
    lead to kernel panic if the returned value is inaccessible or the memory
    pointed by the returned value is reused.
    
    Reference of upstream discussion:
    
            https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10734933/
    
    Instead of calling scsi_host_find_tag() API for each and every smid (smid
    is tag +1) from one to shost->can_queue, now driver will call this API (to
    obtain the outstanding scmd) only for those smid's which are outstanding at
    the driver level.
    
    Driver will determine whether this smid is outstanding at driver level by
    looking into it's corresponding MPI request frame, if its MPI request frame
    is empty, then it means that this smid is free and does not need to call
    scsi_host_find_tag() for it.  By doing this, driver will invoke
    scsi_host_find_tag() for only those tags which are outstanding at the
    driver level.
    
    Driver will check whether particular MPI request frame is empty or not by
    looking into the "DevHandle" field. If this field is zero then it means
    that this MPI request is empty. For active MPI request DevHandle must be
    non-zero.
    
    Also driver will memset the MPI request frame once the corresponding scmd
    is processed (i.e. just before calling
    scmd->done function).

    drm: Fix drm_release() and device unplug
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f04e0a6cfebf48152ac64502346cdc258811f79 ]
    
    If userspace has open fd(s) when drm_dev_unplug() is run, it will result
    in drm_dev_unregister() being called twice. First in drm_dev_unplug() and
    then later in drm_release() through the call to drm_put_dev().
    
    Since userspace already holds a ref on drm_device through the drm_minor,
    it's not necessary to add extra ref counting based on no open file
    handles. Instead just drm_dev_put() unconditionally in drm_dev_unplug().
    
    We now have this:
    - Userpace holds a ref on drm_device as long as there's open fd(s)
    - The driver holds a ref on drm_device as long as it's bound to the
      struct device
    
    When both sides are done with drm_device, it is released.

    callers of tcf_gact_goto_chain_index() can potentially read an old value
    of the chain index, or even dereference a NULL 'goto_chain' pointer,
    because 'goto_chain' and 'tcfa_action' are read in the traffic path
    without caring of concurrent write in the control path. The most recent
    value of chain index can be read also from a->tcfa_action (it's encoded
    there together with TC_ACT_GOTO_CHAIN bits), so we don't really need to
    dereference 'goto_chain': just read the chain id from the control action.

    the driver proceeds as usual and uses pclk value 0 to calculate MDC
    divisor which is incorrect. Hence fix the same in clock initialization.

    [ Upstream commit 22c971db7dd4b0ad8dd88e99c407f7a1f4231a2e ]
    
    Colin King reported a bug in read_bbreg_hdl():
    
            memcpy(pcmd->rsp, (u8 *)&val, pcmd->rspsz);
    
    The problem is that "val" is uninitialized.
    
    This code is obviously not useful, but so far as I can tell
    "pcmd->cmdcode" is never GEN_CMD_CODE(_Read_BBREG) so it's not harmful
    either.  For now the easiest fix is to just call r8712_free_cmd_obj()
    and return.

    net: ks8851: Set initial carrier state to down
    
    [ Upstream commit 9624bafa5f6418b9ca5b3f66d1f6a6a2e8bf6d4c ]
    
    The ks8851 chip's initial carrier state is down. A Link Change Interrupt
    is signaled once interrupts are enabled if the carrier is up.
    
    The ks8851 driver has it backwards by assuming that the initial carrier
    state is up. The state is therefore misrepresented if the interface is
    opened with no cable attached. Fix it.
    
    The Link Change interrupt is sometimes not signaled unless the P1MBSR
    register (which contains the Link Status bit) is read on ->ndo_open().
    This might be a hardware erratum. Read the register by calling
    mii_check_link(), which has the desirable side effect of setting the
    carrier state to down if the cable was detached while the interface was
    closed.

    net: ks8851: Delay requesting IRQ until opened
    
    [ Upstream commit d268f31552794abf5b6aa5af31021643411f25f5 ]
    
    The ks8851 driver currently requests the IRQ before registering the
    net_device.  Because the net_device name is used as IRQ name and is
    still "eth%d" when the IRQ is requested, it's impossibe to tell IRQs
    apart if multiple ks8851 chips are present.  Most other drivers delay
    requesting the IRQ until the net_device is opened.  Do the same.
    
    The driver doesn't enable interrupts on the chip before opening the
    net_device and disables them when closing it, so there doesn't seem to
    be a need to request the IRQ already on probe.

    net: ks8851: Reassert reset pin if chip ID check fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 761cfa979a0c177d6c2d93ef5585cd79ae49a7d5 ]
    
    Commit 73fdeb82e963 ("net: ks8851: Add optional vdd_io regulator and
    reset gpio") amended the ks8851 driver to briefly assert the chip's
    reset pin on probe. It also amended the probe routine's error path to
    reassert the reset pin if a subsequent initialization step fails.
    
    However the commit misplaced reassertion of the reset pin in the error
    path such that it is not performed if the check of the Chip ID and
    Enable Register (CIDER) fails. The error path is therefore slightly
    asymmetrical to the probe routine's body. Fix it.

    net: ks8851: Dequeue RX packets explicitly
    
    [ Upstream commit 536d3680fd2dab5c39857d62a3e084198fc74ff9 ]
    
    The ks8851 driver lets the chip auto-dequeue received packets once they
    have been read in full. It achieves that by setting the ADRFE flag in
    the RXQCR register ("Auto-Dequeue RXQ Frame Enable").
    
    However if allocation of a packet's socket buffer or retrieval of the
    packet over the SPI bus fails, the packet will not have been read in
    full and is not auto-dequeued. Such partial retrieval of a packet
    confuses the chip's RX queue management:  On the next RX interrupt,
    the first packet read from the queue will be the one left there
    previously and this one can be retrieved without issues. But for any
    newly received packets, the frame header status and byte count registers
    (RXFHSR and RXFHBCR) contain bogus values, preventing their retrieval.
    
    The chip allows explicitly dequeueing a packet from the RX queue by
    setting the RRXEF flag in the RXQCR register ("Release RX Error Frame").
    This could be used to dequeue the packet in case of an error, but if
    that error is a failed SPI transfer, it is unknown if the packet was
    transferred in full and was auto-dequeued or if it was only transferred
    in part and requires an explicit dequeue. The safest approach is thus
    to always dequeue packets explicitly and forgo auto-dequeueing.
    
    Without this change, I've witnessed packet retrieval break completely
    when an SPI DMA transfer fails, requiring a chip reset. Explicit
    dequeueing magically fixes this and makes packet retrieval absolutely
    robust for me.
    
    The chip's documentation suggests auto-dequeuing and uses the RRXEF
    flag only to dequeue error frames which the driver doesn't want to
    retrieve. But that seems to be a fair-weather approach.

    usb: gadget: net2280: Fix overrun of OUT messages
    
    [ Upstream commit 9d6a54c1430647355a5e23434881b2ca3d192b48 ]
    
    The OUT endpoint normally blocks (NAK) subsequent packets when a
    short packet was received and returns an incomplete queue entry to
    the gadget driver. Thereby the gadget driver can detect a short packet
    when reading queue entries with a length that is not equal to a
    multiple of packet size.
    
    The start_queue() function enables receiving OUT packets regardless of
    the content of the OUT FIFO. This results in a race: With the current
    code, it's possible that the "!ep->is_in && (readl(&ep->regs->ep_stat)
    & BIT(NAK_OUT_PACKETS))" test in start_dma() will fail, then a short
    packet will be received, and then start_queue() will call
    stop_out_naking(). That's what we don't want (OUT naking gets turned
    off while there is data in the FIFO) because then the next driver
    request might receive a mixture of old and new packets.
    
    With the patch, this race can't occur because the FIFO's state is
    tested after we know that OUT naking is already turned on, and OUT
    naking is stopped only when both of the conditions are met.  This
    ensures that all received data is delivered to the gadget driver,
    which can detect a short packet now before new packets are appended
    to the last short packet.

    amounts to writing to the various tables that the guest has allocated.
    
    When doing this, we fail to take the srcu lock, and the kernel
    shouts loudly if running a lockdep kernel:

    KVM: arm64: Reset the PMU in preemptible context
    
    [ Upstream commit ebff0b0e3d3c862c16c487959db5e0d879632559 ]
    
    We've become very cautious to now always reset the vcpu when nothing
    is loaded on the physical CPU. To do so, we now disable preemption
    and do a kvm_arch_vcpu_put() to make sure we have all the state
    in memory (and that it won't be loaded behind out back).
    
    This now causes issues with resetting the PMU, which calls into perf.
    Perf itself uses mutexes, which clashes with the lack of preemption.
    It is worth realizing that the PMU is fully emulated, and that
    no PMU state is ever loaded on the physical CPU. This means we can
    perfectly reset the PMU outside of the non-preemptible section.

    serial: ar933x_uart: Fix build failure with disabled console
    
    [ Upstream commit 72ff51d8dd262d1fef25baedc2ac35116435be47 ]
    
    Andrey has reported on OpenWrt's bug tracking system[1], that he
    currently can't use ar93xx_uart as pure serial UART without console
    (CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE and CONFIG_SERIAL_AR933X_CONSOLE undefined),
    because compilation ends with following error:
    
     ar933x_uart.c: In function 'ar933x_uart_console_write':
     ar933x_uart.c:550:14: error: 'struct uart_port' has no
                                   member named 'sysrq'
    
    So this patch moves all the code related to console handling behind
    series of CONFIG_SERIAL_AR933X_CONSOLE ifdefs.

    The problem here is the 'select NF_DUP_IPV6 if IP6_NF_IPTABLES'
    that forces NF_DUP_IPV6 to be =m as well rather than setting it

    IP6_NF_IPTABLES avoids that broken configuration.

    [ Upstream commit 1beea6204e2304dd11600791d8dad8e7350af6ad ]
    
    When building without CONFIG_OF, the compiler loses track of the flow
    control in axis_fifo_probe(), and thinks that many variables are used
    without an initialization even though we actually leave the function
    before the first use:
    
    drivers/staging/axis-fifo/axis-fifo.c: In function 'axis_fifo_probe':
    drivers/staging/axis-fifo/axis-fifo.c:900:5: error: 'rxd_tdata_width' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

    xsk: fix umem memory leak on cleanup
    
    [ Upstream commit 044175a06706d516aa42874bb44dbbfc3c4d20eb ]
    
    When the umem is cleaned up, the task that created it might already be
    gone. If the task was gone, the xdp_umem_release function did not free
    the pages member of struct xdp_umem.
    
    It turned out that the task lookup was not needed at all; The code was
    a left-over when we moved from task accounting to user accounting [1].
    
    This patch fixes the memory leak by removing the task lookup logic
    completely.

    s390: limit brk randomization to 32MB
    
    [ Upstream commit cd479eccd2e057116d504852814402a1e68ead80 ]
    
    For a 64-bit process the randomization of the program break is quite
    large with 1GB. That is as big as the randomization of the anonymous
    mapping base, for a test case started with '/lib/ld64.so.1 <exec>'
    it can happen that the heap is placed after the stack. To avoid
    this limit the program break randomization to 32MB for 64-bit and
    keep 8MB for 31-bit.

    fs: prevent page refcount overflow in pipe_buf_get
    
    commit 15fab63e1e57be9fdb5eec1bbc5916e9825e9acb upstream.
    
    Change pipe_buf_get() to return a bool indicating whether it succeeded
    in raising the refcount of the page (if the thing in the pipe is a page).
    This removes another mechanism for overflowing the page refcount.  All
    callers converted to handle a failure.

    mm: prevent get_user_pages() from overflowing page refcount
    
    commit 8fde12ca79aff9b5ba951fce1a2641901b8d8e64 upstream.
    
    If the page refcount wraps around past zero, it will be freed while
    there are still four billion references to it.  One of the possible
    avenues for an attacker to try to make this happen is by doing direct IO
    on a page multiple times.  This patch makes get_user_pages() refuse to
    take a new page reference if there are already more than two billion
    references to the page.

    mm: add 'try_get_page()' helper function
    
    commit 88b1a17dfc3ed7728316478fae0f5ad508f50397 upstream.
    
    This is the same as the traditional 'get_page()' function, but instead
    of unconditionally incrementing the reference count of the page, it only
    does so if the count was "safe".  It returns whether the reference count
    was incremented (and is marked __must_check, since the caller obviously
    has to be aware of it).
    
    Also like 'get_page()', you can't use this function unless you already
    had a reference to the page.  The intent is that you can use this
    exactly like get_page(), but in situations where you want to limit the
    maximum reference count.
    
    The code currently does an unconditional WARN_ON_ONCE() if we ever hit
    the reference count issues (either zero or negative), as a notification
    that the conditional non-increment actually happened.
    
    NOTE! The count access for the "safety" check is inherently racy, but
    that doesn't matter since the buffer we use is basically half the range
    of the reference count (ie we look at the sign of the count).

    mm: make page ref count overflow check tighter and more explicit
    
    commit f958d7b528b1b40c44cfda5eabe2d82760d868c3 upstream.
    
    We have a VM_BUG_ON() to check that the page reference count doesn't
    underflow (or get close to overflow) by checking the sign of the count.
    
    That's all fine, but we actually want to allow people to use a "get page
    ref unless it's already very high" helper function, and we want that one
    to use the sign of the page ref (without triggering this VM_BUG_ON).
    
    Change the VM_BUG_ON to only check for small underflows (or _very_ close
    to overflowing), and ignore overflows which have strayed into negative
    territory.

    Revert "ACPICA: Clear status of GPEs before enabling them"
    
    commit 2c2a2fb1e2a9256714338875bede6b7cbd4b9542 upstream.
    
    Revert commit c8b1917c8987 ("ACPICA: Clear status of GPEs before
    enabling them") that causes problems with Thunderbolt controllers
    to occur if a dock device is connected at init time (the xhci_hcd
    and thunderbolt modules crash which prevents peripherals connected
    through them from working).
    
    Commit c8b1917c8987 effectively causes commit ecc1165b8b74 ("ACPICA:
    Dispatch active GPEs at init time") to get undone, so the problem
    addressed by commit ecc1165b8b74 appears again as a result of it.

    commit dfbd199a7cfe3e3cd8531e1353cdbd7175bfbc5e upstream.
    
    When compiling genheaders and mdp from a newer host kernel, the
    following error happens:
    
        In file included from scripts/selinux/genheaders/genheaders.c:18:
        ./security/selinux/include/classmap.h:238:2: error: #error New
