    KVM: x86: fix singlestepping over syscall
    
    commit c8401dda2f0a00cd25c0af6a95ed50e478d25de4 upstream.
    
    TF is handled a bit differently for syscall and sysret, compared
    to the other instructions: TF is checked after the instruction completes,
    so that the OS can disable #DB at a syscall by adding TF to FMASK.
    When the sysret is executed the #DB is taken "as if" the syscall insn
    just completed.
    
    KVM emulates syscall so that it can trap 32-bit syscall on Intel processors.
    Fix the behavior, otherwise you could get #DB on a user stack which is not
    nice.  This does not affect Linux guests, as they use an IST or task gate
    for #DB.
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-7518.

    rxrpc: Fix several cases where a padded len isn't checked in ticket decode
    
    commit 5f2f97656ada8d811d3c1bef503ced266fcd53a0 upstream.
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-7482.
    
    When a kerberos 5 ticket is being decoded so that it can be loaded into an
    rxrpc-type key, there are several places in which the length of a
    variable-length field is checked to make sure that it's not going to
    overrun the available data - but the data is padded to the nearest
    four-byte boundary and the code doesn't check for this extra.  This could
    lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer going
    over the end of the buffer.
    
    Fix this by making the various variable-length data checks use the padded
    length.

    drm/vmwgfx: limit the number of mip levels in vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl()
    
    commit ee9c4e681ec4f58e42a83cb0c22a0289ade1aacf upstream.
    
    The 'req->mip_levels' parameter in vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl() is
    a user-controlled 'uint32_t' value which is used as a loop count limit.
    This can lead to a kernel lockup and DoS. Add check for 'req->mip_levels'.

    mm: fix new crash in unmapped_area_topdown()
    
    commit f4cb767d76cf7ee72f97dd76f6cfa6c76a5edc89 upstream.
    
    Trinity gets kernel BUG at mm/mmap.c:1963! in about 3 minutes of
    mmap testing.  That's the VM_BUG_ON(gap_end < gap_start) at the
    end of unmapped_area_topdown().  Linus points out how MAP_FIXED
    (which does not have to respect our stack guard gap intentions)
    could result in gap_end below gap_start there.  Fix that, and
    the similar case in its alternative, unmapped_area().

    mm: larger stack guard gap, between vmas
    
    commit 1be7107fbe18eed3e319a6c3e83c78254b693acb upstream.
    
    Stack guard page is a useful feature to reduce a risk of stack smashing
    into a different mapping. We have been using a single page gap which
    is sufficient to prevent having stack adjacent to a different mapping.
    But this seems to be insufficient in the light of the stack usage in
    userspace. E.g. glibc uses as large as 64kB alloca() in many commonly
    used functions. Others use constructs liks gid_t buffer[NGROUPS_MAX]
    which is 256kB or stack strings with MAX_ARG_STRLEN.
    
    This will become especially dangerous for suid binaries and the default
    no limit for the stack size limit because those applications can be
    tricked to consume a large portion of the stack and a single glibc call
    could jump over the guard page. These attacks are not theoretical,
    unfortunatelly.
    
    Make those attacks less probable by increasing the stack guard gap
    to 1MB (on systems with 4k pages; but make it depend on the page size
    because systems with larger base pages might cap stack allocations in
    the PAGE_SIZE units) which should cover larger alloca() and VLA stack
    allocations. It is obviously not a full fix because the problem is
    somehow inherent, but it should reduce attack space a lot.
    
    One could argue that the gap size should be configurable from userspace,
    but that can be done later when somebody finds that the new 1MB is wrong
    for some special case applications.  For now, add a kernel command line
    option (stack_guard_gap) to specify the stack gap size (in page units).
    
    Implementation wise, first delete all the old code for stack guard page:
    because although we could get away with accounting one extra page in a
    stack vma, accounting a larger gap can break userspace - case in point,
    a program run with "ulimit -S -v 20000" failed when the 1MB gap was
    counted for RLIMIT_AS; similar problems could come with RLIMIT_MLOCK
    and strict non-overcommit mode.
    
    Instead of keeping gap inside the stack vma, maintain the stack guard
    gap as a gap between vmas: using vm_start_gap() in place of vm_start
    (or vm_end_gap() in place of vm_end if VM_GROWSUP) in just those few
    places which need to respect the gap - mainly arch_get_unmapped_area(),
    and and the vma tree's subtree_gap support for that.
