    io_uring: hold 'ctx' reference around task_work queue + execute
    
    commit 6d816e088c359866f9867057e04f244c608c42fe upstream.
    
    We're holding the request reference, but we need to go one higher
    to ensure that the ctx remains valid after the request has finished.
    If the ring is closed with pending task_work inflight, and the
    given io_kiocb finishes sync during issue, then we need a reference
    to the ring itself around the task_work execution cycle.

    io_uring: enable lookup of links holding inflight files
    
    commit f254ac04c8744cf7bfed012717eac34eacc65dfb upstream.
    
    When a process exits, we cancel whatever requests it has pending that
    are referencing the file table. However, if a link is holding a
    reference, then we cannot find it by simply looking at the inflight
    list.
    
    Enable checking of the poll and timeout list to find the link, and
    cancel it appropriately.

    commit 9b7adba9eaec28e0e4343c96d0dbeb9578802f5f upstream.
    
    When we traverse into failing links or timeouts, we need to ensure we
    propagate the REQ_F_COMP_LOCKED flag to ensure that we correctly signal
    to the completion side that we already hold the completion lock.

    task_work: only grab task signal lock when needed
    
    commit ebf0d100df0731901c16632f78d78d35f4123bc4 upstream.
    
    If JOBCTL_TASK_WORK is already set on the targeted task, then we need
    not go through {lock,unlock}_task_sighand() to set it again and queue
    a signal wakeup. This is safe as we're checking it _after_ adding the
    new task_work with cmpxchg().
    
    The ordering is as follows:
    
    task_work_add()                         get_signal()
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    STORE(task->task_works, new_work);      STORE(task->jobctl);
    mb();                                   mb();
    LOAD(task->jobctl);                     LOAD(task->task_works);
    
    This speeds up TWA_SIGNAL handling quite a bit, which is important now
    that io_uring is relying on it for all task_work deliveries.

    io_uring: Fix NULL pointer dereference in loop_rw_iter()
    
    commit 2dd2111d0d383df104b144e0d1f6b5a00cb7cd88 upstream.
    
    loop_rw_iter() does not check whether the file has a read or
    write function. This can lead to NULL pointer dereference
    when the user passes in a file descriptor that does not have
    read or write function.
    
    The crash log looks like this:

    io_uring: sanitize double poll handling
    
    commit d4e7cd36a90e38e0276d6ce0c20f5ccef17ec38c upstream.
    
    There's a bit of confusion on the matching pairs of poll vs double poll,
    depending on if the request is a pure poll (IORING_OP_POLL_ADD) or
    poll driven retry.
    
    Add io_poll_get_double() that returns the double poll waitqueue, if any,
    and io_poll_get_single() that returns the original poll waitqueue. With
    that, remove the argument to io_poll_remove_double().
    
    Finally ensure that wait->private is cleared once the double poll handler
    has run, so that remove knows it's already been seen.

    s390/gmap: improve THP splitting
    
    commit ba925fa35057a062ac98c3e8138b013ce4ce351c upstream.
    
    During s390_enable_sie(), we need to take care of splitting all qemu user
    process THP mappings. This is currently done with follow_page(FOLL_SPLIT),
    by simply iterating over all vma ranges, with PAGE_SIZE increment.
    
    This logic is sub-optimal and can result in a lot of unnecessary overhead,
    especially when using qemu and ASAN with large shadow map. Ilya reported
    significant system slow-down with one CPU busy for a long time and overall
    unresponsiveness.
    
    Fix this by using walk_page_vma() and directly calling split_huge_pmd()
    only for present pmds, which greatly reduces overhead.

    commit 535e4fc623fab2e09a0653fc3a3e17f382ad0251 upstream.
    
    The node distance is hardcoded to 0, which causes a trouble
    for some user-level applications. In particular, "libnuma"
    expects the distance of a node to itself as LOCAL_DISTANCE.
    This update removes the offending node distance override.

    commit 9f4aa52387c68049403b59939df5c0dd8e3872cc upstream.
    
    During initialization of the DASD DIAG driver a request is issued
    that has a bio structure that resides on the stack. With virtually
    mapped kernel stacks this bio address might be in virtual storage
    which is unsuitable for usage with the diag250 call.
    In this case the device can not be set online using the DIAG
    discipline and fails with -EOPNOTSUP.
    In the system journal the following error message is presented:
    
    dasd: X.X.XXXX Setting the DASD online with discipline DIAG failed
    with rc=-95
    
    Fix by allocating the bio structure instead of having it on the stack.

    xen/balloon: fix accounting in alloc_xenballooned_pages error path
    
    commit 1951fa33ec259abdf3497bfee7b63e7ddbb1a394 upstream.
    
    target_unpopulated is incremented with nr_pages at the start of the
    function, but the call to free_xenballooned_pages will only subtract
    pgno number of pages, and thus the rest need to be subtracted before
    returning or else accounting will be skewed.

    firmware_loader: EFI firmware loader must handle pre-allocated buffer
    
    commit 4fb60b158afd3ac9e0fe9975aa476213f5cc0a4d upstream.
    
    The EFI platform firmware fallback would clobber any pre-allocated
    buffers. Instead, correctly refuse to reallocate when too small (as
    already done in the sysfs fallback), or perform allocation normally
    when needed.

    irqdomain/treewide: Free firmware node after domain removal
    
    commit ec0160891e387f4771f953b888b1fe951398e5d9 upstream.
    
    Commit 711419e504eb ("irqdomain: Add the missing assignment of
    domain->fwnode for named fwnode") unintentionally caused a dangling pointer
    page fault issue on firmware nodes that were freed after IRQ domain
    allocation. Commit e3beca48a45b fixed that dangling pointer issue by only
    freeing the firmware node after an IRQ domain allocation failure. That fix
    no longer frees the firmware node immediately, but leaves the firmware node
    allocated after the domain is removed.
    
    The firmware node must be kept around through irq_domain_remove, but should be
    freed it afterwards.
    
    Add the missing free operations after domain removal where where appropriate.

    firmware: qcom_scm: Fix legacy convention SCM accessors
    
    commit b88c28280c3f7097546db93824686db1e7dceee1 upstream.
    
    The move to a combined driver for the QCOM SCM hardware changed the
    io_writel and io_readl helpers to use non-atomic calls, despite the
    commit message saying that atomic was a better option. This breaks these
    helpers on hardware that uses the old legacy convention (access fails
    with a -95 return code). Switch back to using the atomic calls.
    
    Observed as a failure routing GPIO interrupts to the Apps processor on
    an IPQ8064; fix is confirmed as correctly allowing the interrupts to be
    routed and observed.

    ARM: 8992/1: Fix unwind_frame for clang-built kernels
    
    commit b4d5ec9b39f8b31d98f65bc5577b5d15d93795d7 upstream.
    
    Since clang does not push pc and sp in function prologues, the current
    implementation of unwind_frame does not work. By using the previous
    frame's lr/fp instead of saved pc/sp we get valid unwinds on clang-built
    kernels.
    
    The bounds check on next frame pointer must be changed as well since
    there are 8 less bytes between frames.
    
    This fixes /proc/<pid>/stack.

    erofs: fix extended inode could cross boundary
    
    commit 0dcd3c94e02438f4a571690e26f4ee997524102a upstream.
    
    Each ondisk inode should be aligned with inode slot boundary
    (32-byte alignment) because of nid calculation formula, so all
    compact inodes (32 byte) cannot across page boundary. However,
    extended inode is now 64-byte form, which can across page boundary
    in principle if the location is specified on purpose, although
    it's hard to be generated by mkfs due to the allocation policy
    and rarely used by Android use case now mainly for > 4GiB files.
    
    For now, only two fields `i_ctime_nsec` and `i_nlink' couldn't
    be read from disk properly and cause out-of-bound memory read
    with random value.
    
    Let's fix now.

    PM / devfreq: rk3399_dmc: Fix kernel oops when rockchip,pmu is absent
    
    commit 63ef91f24f9bfc70b6446319f6cabfd094481372 upstream.
    
    Booting a recent kernel on a rk3399-based system (nanopc-t4),
    equipped with a recent u-boot and ATF results in an Oops due
    to a NULL pointer dereference.
    
    This turns out to be due to the rk3399-dmc driver looking for
    an *undocumented* property (rockchip,pmu), and happily using
    a NULL pointer when the property isn't there.
    
    Instead, make most of what was brought in with 9173c5ceb035
    ("PM / devfreq: rk3399_dmc: Pass ODT and auto power down parameters
    to TF-A.") conditioned on finding this property in the device-tree,
    preventing the driver from exploding.

    cpufreq: dt: fix oops on armada37xx
    
    commit 10470dec3decaf5ed3c596f85debd7c42777ae12 upstream.
    
    Commit 0c868627e617e43a295d8 (cpufreq: dt: Allow platform specific
    intermediate callbacks) added two function pointers to the
    struct cpufreq_dt_platform_data. However, armada37xx_cpufreq_driver_init()
    has this struct (pdata) located on the stack and uses only "suspend"
    and "resume" fields. So these newly added "get_intermediate" and
    "target_intermediate" pointers are uninitialized and contain arbitrary
    non-null values, causing all kinds of trouble.
    
    For instance, here is an oops on espressobin after an attempt to change
    the cpefreq governor:
    
    [   29.174554] Unable to handle kernel execute from non-executable memory at virtual address ffff00003f87bdc0
    ...
    [   29.269373] pc : 0xffff00003f87bdc0
    [   29.272957] lr : __cpufreq_driver_target+0x138/0x580
    ...
    
    Fixed by zeroing out pdata before use.

    The list of governors should never be traversed without the locking

    io_uring: fail poll arm on queue proc failure
    
    commit a36da65c46565d2527eec3efdb546251e38253fd upstream.
    
    Check the ipt.error value, it must have been either cleared to zero or
    set to another error than the default -EINVAL if we don't go through the
    waitqueue proc addition. Just give up on poll at that point and return
    failure, this will fallback to async work.
    
    io_poll_add() doesn't suffer from this failure case, as it returns the
    error value directly.

    io_uring: use TWA_SIGNAL for task_work uncondtionally
    
    commit 0ba9c9edcd152158a0e321a4c13ac1dfc571ff3d upstream.
    
    An earlier commit:
    
    b7db41c9e03b ("io_uring: fix regression with always ignoring signals in io_cqring_wait()")
    
    ensured that we didn't get stuck waiting for eventfd reads when it's
    registered with the io_uring ring for event notification, but we still
    have cases where the task can be waiting on other events in the kernel and
    need a bigger nudge to make forward progress. Or the task could be in the
    kernel and running, but on its way to blocking.
    
    This means that TWA_RESUME cannot reliably be used to ensure we make
    progress. Use TWA_SIGNAL unconditionally.

    commit bd74048108c179cea0ff52979506164c80f29da7 upstream.
    
    If we hit an earlier error path in io_uring_create(), then we will have
    accounted memory, but not set ctx->{sq,cq}_entries yet. Then when the
    ring is torn down in error, we use those values to unaccount the memory.
    
    Ensure we set the ctx entries before we're able to hit a potential error
    path.

    media: media-request: Fix crash if memory allocation fails
    
    commit e30cc79cc80fd919b697a15c5000d9f57487de8e upstream.
    
    Syzbot reports a NULL-ptr deref in the kref_put() call:

     prepare_exit_to_usermode+0x48e/0x600 arch/x86/entry/common.c:196
    
    What led to this crash was an injected memory allocation failure in
    media_request_alloc():
    
    FAULT_INJECTION: forcing a failure.
    name failslab, interval 1, probability 0, space 0, times 0

     do_syscall_64+0xf3/0x1b0
    
    When that allocation fails, filp->private_data is left uninitialized
    which media_request_close() does not expect and crashes.
    
    To avoid this, reorder media_request_alloc() such that
    allocating the struct file happens as the last step thus
    media_request_close() will no longer get called for a partially created
    media request.

    driver core: Fix probe_count imbalance in really_probe()
    
    commit b292b50b0efcc7095d8bf15505fba6909bb35dce upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting hung task in wait_for_device_probe() [1]. At least,
    we always need to decrement probe_count if we incremented probe_count in
    really_probe().
    
    However, since I can't find "Resources present before probing" message in
    the console log, both "this message simply flowed off" and "syzbot is not
    hitting this path" will be possible. Therefore, while we are at it, let's
    also prepare for concurrent wait_for_device_probe() calls by replacing
    wake_up() with wake_up_all().

    kvm: x86: replace kvm_spec_ctrl_test_value with runtime test on the host
    
    commit 841c2be09fe4f495fe5224952a419bd8c7e5b455 upstream.
    
    To avoid complex and in some cases incorrect logic in
    kvm_spec_ctrl_test_value, just try the guest's given value on the host
    processor instead, and if it doesn't #GP, allow the guest to set it.
    
    One such case is when host CPU supports STIBP mitigation
    but doesn't support IBRS (as is the case with some Zen2 AMD cpus),
    and in this case we were giving guest #GP when it tried to use STIBP
    
    The reason why can can do the host test is that IA32_SPEC_CTRL msr is
    passed to the guest, after the guest sets it to a non zero value
    for the first time (due to performance reasons),
    and as as result of this, it is pointless to emulate #GP condition on
    this first access, in a different way than what the host CPU does.
    
    This is based on a patch from Sean Christopherson, who suggested this idea.

    fs/minix: reject too-large maximum file size
    
    commit 270ef41094e9fa95273f288d7d785313ceab2ff3 upstream.
    
    If the minix filesystem tries to map a very large logical block number to
    its on-disk location, block_to_path() can return offsets that are too
    large, causing out-of-bounds memory accesses when accessing indirect index
    blocks.  This should be prevented by the check against the maximum file
    size, but this doesn't work because the maximum file size is read directly
    from the on-disk superblock and isn't validated itself.
    
    Fix this by validating the maximum file size at mount time.

    fs/minix: check return value of sb_getblk()
    
    commit da27e0a0e5f655f0d58d4e153c3182bb2b290f64 upstream.
    
    Patch series "fs/minix: fix syzbot bugs and set s_maxbytes".
    
    This series fixes all syzbot bugs in the minix filesystem:
    
            KASAN: null-ptr-deref Write in get_block
            KASAN: use-after-free Write in get_block
            KASAN: use-after-free Read in get_block
            WARNING in inc_nlink
            KMSAN: uninit-value in get_block
            WARNING in drop_nlink
    
    It also fixes the minix filesystem to set s_maxbytes correctly, so that
    userspace sees the correct behavior when exceeding the max file size.
    
    This patch (of 6):
    
    sb_getblk() can fail, so check its return value.
    
    This fixes a NULL pointer dereference.

    bitfield.h: don't compile-time validate _val in FIELD_FIT
    
    commit 444da3f52407d74c9aa12187ac6b01f76ee47d62 upstream.
    
    When ur_load_imm_any() is inlined into jeq_imm(), it's possible for the
    compiler to deduce a case where _val can only have the value of -1 at
    compile time. Specifically,
    
    /* struct bpf_insn: _s32 imm */
    u64 imm = insn->imm; /* sign extend */
    if (imm >> 32) { /* non-zero only if insn->imm is negative */
      /* inlined from ur_load_imm_any */
      u32 __imm = imm >> 32; /* therefore, always 0xffffffff */
      if (__builtin_constant_p(__imm) && __imm > 255)
        compiletime_assert_XXX()
    
    This can result in tripping a BUILD_BUG_ON() in __BF_FIELD_CHECK() that
    checks that a given value is representable in one byte (interpreted as
    unsigned).
    
    FIELD_FIT() should return true or false at runtime for whether a value
    can fit for not. Don't break the build over a value that's too large for
    the mask. We'd prefer to keep the inlining and compiler optimizations
    though we know this case will always return false.

    tick/nohz: Narrow down noise while setting current task's tick dependency
    
    commit 3c8920e2dbd1a55f72dc14d656df9d0097cf5c72 upstream.
    
    Setting a tick dependency on any task, including the case where a task
    sets that dependency on itself, triggers an IPI to all CPUs.  That is
    of course suboptimal but it had previously not been an issue because it
    was only used by POSIX CPU timers on nohz_full, which apparently never
    occurs in latency-sensitive workloads in production.  (Or users of such
    systems are suffering in silence on the one hand or venting their ire
    on the wrong people on the other.)
    
    But RCU now sets a task tick dependency on the current task in order
    to fix stall issues that can occur during RCU callback processing.
    Thus, RCU callback processing triggers frequent system-wide IPIs from
    nohz_full CPUs.  This is quite counter-productive, after all, avoiding
    IPIs is what nohz_full is supposed to be all about.
    
    This commit therefore optimizes tasks' self-setting of a task tick
    dependency by using tick_nohz_full_kick() to avoid the system-wide IPI.
    Instead, only the execution of the one task is disturbed, which is
    acceptable given that this disturbance is well down into the noise
    compared to the degree to which the RCU callback processing itself
    disturbs execution.

    crypto: ccp - Fix use of merged scatterlists
    
    commit 8a302808c60d441d9884cb00ea7f2b534f2e3ca5 upstream.
    
    Running the crypto manager self tests with
    CONFIG_CRYPTO_MANAGER_EXTRA_TESTS may result in several types of errors
    when using the ccp-crypto driver:
    
    alg: skcipher: cbc-des3-ccp encryption failed on test vector 0; expected_error=0, actual_error=-5 ...
    
    alg: skcipher: ctr-aes-ccp decryption overran dst buffer on test vector 0 ...
    
    alg: ahash: sha224-ccp test failed (wrong result) on test vector ...
    
    These errors are the result of improper processing of scatterlists mapped
    for DMA.
    
    Given a scatterlist in which entries are merged as part of mapping the
    scatterlist for DMA, the DMA length of a merged entry will reflect the
    combined length of the entries that were merged. The subsequent
    scatterlist entry will contain DMA information for the scatterlist entry
    after the last merged entry, but the non-DMA information will be that of
    the first merged entry.
    
    The ccp driver does not take this scatterlist merging into account. To
    address this, add a second scatterlist pointer to track the current
    position in the DMA mapped representation of the scatterlist. Both the DMA
    representation and the original representation of the scatterlist must be
    tracked as while most of the driver can use just the DMA representation,
    scatterlist_map_and_copy() must use the original representation and
    expects the scatterlist pointer to be accurate to the original
    representation.
    
    In order to properly walk the original scatterlist, the scatterlist must
    be walked until the combined lengths of the entries seen is equal to the
    DMA length of the current entry being processed in the DMA mapped
    representation.

    crypto: qat - fix double free in qat_uclo_create_batch_init_list
    
    commit c06c76602e03bde24ee69a2022a829127e504202 upstream.
    
    clang static analysis flags this error
    
    qat_uclo.c:297:3: warning: Attempt to free released memory
      [unix.Malloc]
                    kfree(*init_tab_base);
                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    When input *init_tab_base is null, the function allocates memory for
    the head of the list.  When there is problem allocating other list
    elements the list is unwound and freed.  Then a check is made if the
    list head was allocated and is also freed.
    
    Keeping track of the what may need to be freed is the variable 'tail_old'.
    The unwinding/freeing block is
    
            while (tail_old) {
                    mem_init = tail_old->next;
                    kfree(tail_old);
                    tail_old = mem_init;
            }
    
    The problem is that the first element of tail_old is also what was
    allocated for the list head
    
                    init_header = kzalloc(sizeof(*init_header), GFP_KERNEL);
                    ...
                    *init_tab_base = init_header;
                    flag = 1;
            }
            tail_old = init_header;
    
    So *init_tab_base/init_header are freed twice.
    
    There is another problem.
    When the input *init_tab_base is non null the tail_old is calculated by
    traveling down the list to first non null entry.
    
            tail_old = init_header;
            while (tail_old->next)
                    tail_old = tail_old->next;
    
    When the unwinding free happens, the last entry of the input list will
    be freed.
    
    So the freeing needs a general changed.
    If locally allocated the first element of tail_old is freed, else it
    is skipped.  As a bit of cleanup, reset *init_tab_base if it came in
    as null.

    pstore: Fix linking when crypto API disabled
    
    commit fd49e03280e596e54edb93a91bc96170f8e97e4a upstream.
    
    When building a kernel with CONFIG_PSTORE=y and CONFIG_CRYPTO not set,

        platform.c:(.text+0x784): undefined reference to `crypto_comp_decompress'
    
    This because some pstore code uses crypto_comp_(de)compress regardless
    of the CONFIG_CRYPTO status. Fix it by wrapping the (de)compress usage
    by IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PSTORE_COMPRESS)

    tpm: Unify the mismatching TPM space buffer sizes
    
    commit 6c4e79d99e6f42b79040f1a33cd4018f5425030b upstream.
    
    The size of the buffers for storing context's and sessions can vary from
    arch to arch as PAGE_SIZE can be anything between 4 kB and 256 kB (the
    maximum for PPC64). Define a fixed buffer size set to 16 kB. This should be
    enough for most use with three handles (that is how many we allow at the
    moment). Parametrize the buffer size while doing this, so that it is easier
    to revisit this later on if required.

    ALSA: usb-audio: add quirk for Pioneer DDJ-RB
    
    commit 6e8596172ee1cd46ec0bfd5adcf4ff86371478b6 upstream.
    
    This is just another Pioneer device with fixed endpoints. Input is dummy
    but used as feedback (it always returns silence).

    ALSA: usb-audio: work around streaming quirk for MacroSilicon MS2109
    
    commit 1b7ecc241a67ad6b584e071bd791a54e0cd5f097 upstream.
    
    Further investigation of the L-R swap problem on the MS2109 reveals that
    the problem isn't that the channels are swapped, but rather that they
    are swapped and also out of phase by one sample. In other words, the
    issue is actually that the very first frame that comes from the hardware
    is a half-frame containing only the right channel, and after that
    everything becomes offset.
    
    So introduce a new quirk field to drop the very first 2 bytes that come
    in after the format is configured and a capture stream starts. This puts
    the channels in phase and in the correct order.

    commit 386a6539992b82fe9ac4f9dc3f548956fd894d8c upstream.
    
    After installing the Ubuntu Linux, the micmute led status is not
    correct. Users expect that the led is on if the capture is disabled,
    but with the current kernel, the led is off with the capture disabled.
    
    We tried the old linux kernel like linux-4.15, there is no this issue.
    It looks like we introduced this issue when switching to the led_cdev.

    usb: cdns3: gadget: always zeroed TRB buffer when enable endpoint
    
    commit 95f5acfc4f58f01a22b66d8c9c0ffb72aa96271c upstream.
    
    During the endpoint dequeue operation, it changes dequeued TRB as link
    TRB, when the endpoint is disabled and re-enabled, the DMA fetches the
    TRB before the link TRB, after it handles current TRB, the DMA pointer
    will advance to the TRB after link TRB, but enqueue and dequene
    variables don't know it due to no hardware interrupt at the time, when
    the next TRB is added to link TRB position, the DMA will not handle
    this TRB due to its pointer is already at the next TRB. See the trace

    net: initialize fastreuse on inet_inherit_port
    
    [ Upstream commit d76f3351cea2d927fdf70dd7c06898235035e84e ]
    
    In the case of TPROXY, bind_conflict optimizations for SO_REUSEADDR or
    SO_REUSEPORT are broken, possibly resulting in O(n) instead of O(1) bind
    behaviour or in the incorrect reuse of a bind.
    
    the kernel keeps track for each bind_bucket if all sockets in the
    bind_bucket support SO_REUSEADDR or SO_REUSEPORT in two fastreuse flags.
    These flags allow skipping the costly bind_conflict check when possible
    (meaning when all sockets have the proper SO_REUSE option).
    
    For every socket added to a bind_bucket, these flags need to be updated.
    As soon as a socket that does not support reuse is added, the flag is
    set to false and will never go back to true, unless the bind_bucket is
    deleted.
    
    Note that there is no mechanism to re-evaluate these flags when a socket
    is removed (this might make sense when removing a socket that would not
    allow reuse; this leaves room for a future patch).
    
    For this optimization to work, it is mandatory that these flags are
    properly initialized and updated.
    
    When a child socket is created from a listen socket in
    __inet_inherit_port, the TPROXY case could create a new bind bucket
    without properly initializing these flags, thus preventing the
    optimization to work. Alternatively, a socket not allowing reuse could
    be added to an existing bind bucket without updating the flags, causing
    bind_conflict to never be called as it should.
    
    Call inet_csk_update_fastreuse when __inet_inherit_port decides to create
    a new bind_bucket or use a different bind_bucket than the one of the
    listen socket.

    vmxnet3: use correct tcp hdr length when packet is encapsulated

    Commit dacce2be3312 ("vmxnet3: add geneve and vxlan tunnel offload
    support") added support for encapsulation offload. However, while
    calculating tcp hdr length, it does not take into account if the
    packet is encapsulated or not.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by using correct reference for inner
    tcp header.

    tcp: correct read of TFO keys on big endian systems
    
    [ Upstream commit f19008e676366c44e9241af57f331b6c6edf9552 ]
    
    When TFO keys are read back on big endian systems either via the global
    sysctl interface or via getsockopt() using TCP_FASTOPEN_KEY, the values
    don't match what was written.
    
    For example, on s390x:
    
    # echo "1-2-3-4" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen_key
    # cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen_key
    02000000-01000000-04000000-03000000
    
    Instead of:
    
    # cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen_key
    00000001-00000002-00000003-00000004
    
    Fix this by converting to the correct endianness on read. This was
    reported by Colin Ian King when running the 'tcp_fastopen_backup_key' net
    selftest on s390x, which depends on the read value matching what was
    written. I've confirmed that the test now passes on big and little endian
    systems.

    drivers/net/wan/lapbether: Added needed_headroom and a skb->len check
    
    [ Upstream commit c7ca03c216acb14466a713fedf1b9f2c24994ef2 ]
    
    1. Added a skb->len check
    
    This driver expects upper layers to include a pseudo header of 1 byte
    when passing down a skb for transmission. This driver will read this
    1-byte header. This patch added a skb->len check before reading the
    header to make sure the header exists.
    
    2. Changed to use needed_headroom instead of hard_header_len to request
    necessary headroom to be allocated
    
    In net/packet/af_packet.c, the function packet_snd first reserves a
    headroom of length (dev->hard_header_len + dev->needed_headroom).
    Then if the socket is a SOCK_DGRAM socket, it calls dev_hard_header,
    which calls dev->header_ops->create, to create the link layer header.
    If the socket is a SOCK_RAW socket, it "un-reserves" a headroom of
    length (dev->hard_header_len), and assumes the user to provide the
    appropriate link layer header.
    
    So according to the logic of af_packet.c, dev->hard_header_len should
    be the length of the header that would be created by
    dev->header_ops->create.
    
    However, this driver doesn't provide dev->header_ops, so logically
    dev->hard_header_len should be 0.
    
    So we should use dev->needed_headroom instead of dev->hard_header_len
    to request necessary headroom to be allocated.
    
    This change fixes kernel panic when this driver is used with AF_PACKET
    SOCK_RAW sockets.

    af_packet: TPACKET_V3: fix fill status rwlock imbalance
    
    [ Upstream commit 88fd1cb80daa20af063bce81e1fad14e945a8dc4 ]
    
    After @blk_fill_in_prog_lock is acquired there is an early out vnet
    situation that can occur. In that case, the rwlock needs to be
    released.
    
    Also, since @blk_fill_in_prog_lock is only acquired when @tp_version
    is exactly TPACKET_V3, only release it on that exact condition as
    well.
    
    And finally, add sparse annotation so that it is clearer that
    prb_fill_curr_block() and prb_clear_blk_fill_status() are acquiring
    and releasing @blk_fill_in_prog_lock, respectively. sparse is still
    unable to understand the balance, but the warnings are now on a
    higher level that make more sense.

    reassigned with non-absolute values several times, which IAS did not
    support. We can avoid the reassignment by replacing the uses of
    var_ddq_add with its definitions accordingly to have compatilibility
    with IAS.

    [ Upstream commit 986a4b63d3bc5f2c0eb4083b05aff2bf883b7b2f ]
    
    Braino when converting "buf->len -=" to "buf->len = len -".
    
    The result is under-estimation of the ralign and rslack values. On
    krb5p mounts, this has caused READDIR to fail with EIO, and KASAN
    splats when decoding READLINK replies.
    
    As a result of fixing this oversight, the gss_unwrap method now
    returns a buf->len that can be shorter than priv_len for small
    RPC messages. The additional adjustment done in unwrap_priv_data()
    can underflow buf->len. This causes the nfsd_request_too_large
    check to fail during some NFSv3 operations.

    pinctrl-single: fix pcs_parse_pinconf() return value
    
    [ Upstream commit f46fe79ff1b65692a65266a5bec6dbe2bf7fc70f ]
    
    This patch causes pcs_parse_pinconf() to return -ENOTSUPP when no
    pinctrl_map is added.  The current behavior is to return 0 when
    !PCS_HAS_PINCONF or !nconfs.  Thus pcs_parse_one_pinctrl_entry()
    incorrectly assumes that a map was added and sets num_maps = 2.
    
    Analysis:
    =========
    The function pcs_parse_one_pinctrl_entry() calls pcs_parse_pinconf()
    if PCS_HAS_PINCONF is enabled.  The function pcs_parse_pinconf()
    returns 0 to indicate there was no error and num_maps is then set to 2:
    
     980 static int pcs_parse_one_pinctrl_entry(struct pcs_device *pcs,
     981                                                 struct device_node *np,
     982                                                 struct pinctrl_map **map,
     983                                                 unsigned *num_maps,
     984                                                 const char **pgnames)
     985 {
    <snip>
    1053         (*map)->type = PIN_MAP_TYPE_MUX_GROUP;
    1054         (*map)->data.mux.group = np->name;
    1055         (*map)->data.mux.function = np->name;
    1056
    1057         if (PCS_HAS_PINCONF && function) {
    1058                 res = pcs_parse_pinconf(pcs, np, function, map);
    1059                 if (res)
    1060                         goto free_pingroups;
    1061                 *num_maps = 2;
    1062         } else {
    1063                 *num_maps = 1;
    1064         }
    
    However, pcs_parse_pinconf() will also return 0 if !PCS_HAS_PINCONF or
    !nconfs.  I believe these conditions should indicate that no map was
    added by returning -ENOTSUPP. Otherwise pcs_parse_one_pinctrl_entry()
    will set num_maps = 2 even though no maps were successfully added, as
    it does not reach "m++" on line 940:
    
     895 static int pcs_parse_pinconf(struct pcs_device *pcs, struct device_node *np,
     896                              struct pcs_function *func,
     897                              struct pinctrl_map **map)
     898
     899 {
     900         struct pinctrl_map *m = *map;
    <snip>
     917         /* If pinconf isn't supported, don't parse properties in below. */
     918         if (!PCS_HAS_PINCONF)
     919                 return 0;
     920
     921         /* cacluate how much properties are supported in current node */
     922         for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(prop2); i++) {
     923                 if (of_find_property(np, prop2[i].name, NULL))
     924                         nconfs++;
     925         }
     926         for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(prop4); i++) {
     927                 if (of_find_property(np, prop4[i].name, NULL))
     928                         nconfs++;
     929         }
     930         if (!nconfs)
     919                 return 0;
     932
     933         func->conf = devm_kcalloc(pcs->dev,
     934                                   nconfs, sizeof(struct pcs_conf_vals),
     935                                   GFP_KERNEL);
     936         if (!func->conf)
     937                 return -ENOMEM;
     938         func->nconfs = nconfs;
     939         conf = &(func->conf[0]);
     940         m++;
    
    This situtation will cause a boot failure [0] on the BeagleBone Black
    (AM3358) when am33xx_pinmux node in arch/arm/boot/dts/am33xx-l4.dtsi
    has compatible = "pinconf-single" instead of "pinctrl-single".
    
    The patch fixes this issue by returning -ENOSUPP when !PCS_HAS_PINCONF
    or !nconfs, so that pcs_parse_one_pinctrl_entry() will know that no
    map was added.
    
    Logic is also added to pcs_parse_one_pinctrl_entry() to distinguish
    between -ENOSUPP and other errors.  In the case of -ENOSUPP, num_maps
    is set to 1 as it is valid for pinconf to be enabled and a given pin
    group to not any pinconf properties.

    gpio: don't use same lockdep class for all devm_gpiochip_add_data users
    
    [ Upstream commit 5f402bb17533113c21d61c2d4bc4ef4a6fa1c9a5 ]
    
    Commit 959bc7b22bd2 ("gpio: Automatically add lockdep keys") documents
    in its commits message its intention to "create a unique class key for
    each driver".
    
    It does so by having gpiochip_add_data add in-place the definition of
    two static lockdep classes for LOCKDEP use. That way, every caller of
    the macro adds their gpiochip with unique lockdep classes.
    
    There are many indirect callers of gpiochip_add_data, however, via
    use of devm_gpiochip_add_data. devm_gpiochip_add_data has external
    linkage and all its users will share the same lockdep classes, which
    probably is not intended.
    
    Fix this by replicating the gpio_chip_add_data statics-in-macro for
    the devm_ version as well.

    fsl/fman: use 32-bit unsigned integer
    
    [ Upstream commit 99f47abd9f7bf6e365820d355dc98f6955a562df ]
    
    Potentially overflowing expression (ts_freq << 16 and intgr << 16)
    declared as type u32 (32-bit unsigned) is evaluated using 32-bit
    arithmetic and then used in a context that expects an expression of
    type u64 (64-bit unsigned) which ultimately is used as 16-bit
    unsigned by typecasting to u16. Fixed by using an unsigned 32-bit
    integer since the value is truncated anyway in the end.

    [ Upstream commit c58b6b0372de0d4cd0536d6585addd1b36b151ae ]
    
    I was attempting to use pid filtering with function_graph, but it wasn't
    allowing anything to make it through.  Turns out ftrace_trace_task
    returns false if ftrace_ignore_pid is not-empty, which isn't correct
    anymore.  We're now setting it to FTRACE_PID_IGNORE if we need to ignore
    that pid, otherwise it's set to the pid (which is weird considering the
    name) or to FTRACE_PID_TRACE.  Fix the check to check for !=
    FTRACE_PID_IGNORE.  With this we can now use function_graph with pid
    filtering.

    net/mlx5: Delete extra dump stack that gives nothing
    
    [ Upstream commit 6c4e9bcfb48933d533ff975e152757991556294a ]
    
    The WARN_*() macros are intended to catch impossible situations
    from the SW point of view. They gave a little in case HW<->SW interface
    is out-of-sync.
    
    Such out-of-sync scenario can be due to SW errors that are not part
    of this flow or because some HW errors, where dump stack won't help
    either.
    
    This specific WARN_ON() is useless because mlx5_core code is prepared
    to handle such situations and will unfold everything correctly while
    providing enough information to the users to understand why FS is not
    working.

    tools, build: Propagate build failures from tools/build/Makefile.build
    
    [ Upstream commit a278f3d8191228212c553a5d4303fa603214b717 ]
    
    The '&&' command seems to have a bad effect when $(cmd_$(1)) exits with
    non-zero effect: the command failure is masked (despite `set -e`) and all but
    the first command of $(dep-cmd) is executed (successfully, as they are mostly
    printfs), thus overall returning 0 in the end.
    
    This means in practice that despite compilation errors, tools's build Makefile
    will return success. We see this very reliably with libbpf's Makefile, which
    doesn't get compilation error propagated properly. This in turns causes issues
    with selftests build, as well as bpftool and other projects that rely on
    building libbpf.
    
    The fix is simple: don't use &&. Given `set -e`, we don't need to chain
    commands with &&. The shell will exit on first failure, giving desired
    behavior and propagating error properly.

    rtw88: coex: only skip coex triggered by BT info
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f194bd4ca1cd9b8eef34d37d562279dbeb80319 ]
    
    The coex mechanism used to skip upon the freeze flag is raised.
    That will cause the coex mechanism being skipped unexpectedly.
    Coex only wanted to keep the TDMA table from being changed by
    BT side.
    
    So, check the freeze and reason, if the coex reason is coming
    from BT info, skip it, to make sure the coex triggered by Wifi
    itself can work.
    
    This is required for the AP mode, while the control flow is
    different with STA mode. When starting an AP mode, the AP mode
    needs to start working immedaitely after leaving IPS, and the
    freeze flag could be raised. If the coex info is skipped, then
    the AP mode will not set the antenna owner, leads to TX stuck.

    rtw88: fix short GI capability based on current bandwidth
    
    [ Upstream commit 4dd86b901d1373ef8446ecb50a7ca009f3475211 ]
    
    Fix the transmission is not sent with short GI under
    some conditions even if the receiver supports short GI.
    If VHT capability IE exists in the beacon, the original
    code uses the short GI for 80M field as driver's short GI
    setting for transmission, even the current bandwidth is
    not 80MHz.
    
    Short GI supported fields for 20M/40M are informed in HT
    capability information element, and short GI supported
    field for 80M is informed in VHT capability information
    element.
    
    These three fields may be set to different values.
    Driver needs to record each short GI support field for
    each bandwidth, and send correct info depends on current
    bandwidth to the WiFi firmware.

    The allocation order of things in soc_new_pcm_runtime was changed to
    move the device_register before the allocation of the rtd structure.
    This was to allow the rtd allocation to be managed by devm. However
    currently the sysfs entries are added by device_register and their
    visibility depends on variables within the rtd structure, this causes
    the pmdown_time and dapm_widgets sysfs entries to be missing for all
    rtds.
    
    Correct this issue by manually calling device_add_groups after the

    selftests/powerpc: Fix CPU affinity for child process
    
    [ Upstream commit 854eb5022be04f81e318765f089f41a57c8e5d83 ]
    
    On systems with large number of cpus, test fails trying to set
    affinity by calling sched_setaffinity() with smaller size for affinity
    mask. This patch fixes it by making sure that the size of allocated
    affinity mask is dependent on the number of CPUs as reported by
    get_nprocs().

    selftests/powerpc: Squash spurious errors due to device removal
    
    [ Upstream commit 5f8cf6475828b600ff6d000e580c961ac839cc61 ]
    
    For drivers that don't have the error handling callbacks we implement
    recovery by removing the device and re-probing it. This causes the sysfs
    directory for the PCI device to be removed which causes the following
    spurious error to be printed when checking the PE state:
    
    Breaking 0005:03:00.0...
    ./eeh-basic.sh: line 13: can't open /sys/bus/pci/devices/0005:03:00.0/eeh_pe_state: no such file
    0005:03:00.0, waited 0/60
    0005:03:00.0, waited 1/60

    0005:03:00.0, waited 7/60
    0005:03:00.0, Recovered after 8 seconds
    
    We currently try to avoid this by checking if the PE state file exists
    before reading from it. This is however inherently racy so re-work the
    state checking so that we only read from the file once, and we squash any
    errors that occur while reading.

    xfs: clear XFS_DQ_FREEING if we can't lock the dquot buffer to flush
    
    [ Upstream commit c97738a960a86081a147e7d436138e6481757445 ]
    
    In commit 8d3d7e2b35ea, we changed xfs_qm_dqpurge to bail out if we
    can't lock the dquot buf to flush the dquot.  This prevents the AIL from
    blocking on the dquot, but it also forgets to clear the FREEING flag on
    its way out.  A subsequent purge attempt will see the FREEING flag is
    set and bail out, which leads to dqpurge_all failing to purge all the
    dquots.
    
    (copy-pasting from Dave Chinner's identical patch)
    
    This was found by inspection after having xfs/305 hang 1 in ~50
    iterations in a quotaoff operation:

    Returning -EAGAIN from xfs_qm_dqpurge() without clearing the
    XFS_DQ_FREEING flag means the xfs_qm_dqpurge_all() code can never
    free the dquot, and we loop forever waiting for the XFS_DQ_FREEING
    flag to go away on the dquot that leaked it via -EAGAIN.

    xfs: fix inode allocation block res calculation precedence
    
    [ Upstream commit b2a8864728683443f34a9fd33a2b78b860934cc1 ]
    
    The block reservation calculation for inode allocation is supposed
    to consist of the blocks required for the inode chunk plus
    (maxlevels-1) of the inode btree multiplied by the number of inode
    btrees in the fs (2 when finobt is enabled, 1 otherwise).
    
    Instead, the macro returns (ialloc_blocks + 2) due to a precedence
    error in the calculation logic. This leads to block reservation
    overruns via generic/531 on small block filesystems with finobt
    enabled. Add braces to fix the calculation and reserve the
    appropriate number of blocks.

    net: dsa: rtl8366: Fix VLAN set-up
    
    [ Upstream commit 788abc6d9d278ed6fa1fa94db2098481a04152b7 ]
    
    Alter the rtl8366_vlan_add() to call rtl8366_set_vlan()
    inside the loop that goes over all VIDs since we now
    properly support calling that function more than once.
    Augment the loop to postincrement as this is more
    intuitive.
    
    The loop moved past the last VID but called
    rtl8366_set_vlan() with the port number instead of
    the VID, assuming a 1-to-1 correspondence between
    ports and VIDs. This was also a bug.

    [ Upstream commit 15ab7906cc9290afb006df1bb1074907fbcc7061 ]
    
    The RTL8366 would not handle adding new members (ports) to
    a VLAN: the code assumed that ->port_vlan_add() was only
    called once for a single port. When intializing the
    switch with .configure_vlan_while_not_filtering set to
    true, the function is called numerous times for adding
    all ports to VLAN1, which was something the code could
    not handle.
    
    Alter rtl8366_set_vlan() to just |= new members and
    untagged flags to 4k and MC VLAN table entries alike.
    This makes it possible to just add new ports to a
    VLAN.
    
    Put in some helpful debug code that can be used to find
    any further bugs here.

    the ID of what originally was an early Bluetooth 1.1 controller.
    
    Linux is the only place where they don't work due to spotty checks
    in our detection code. It only covered a minimum subset.
    
    So what's the big idea? Take advantage of the fact that all CSR
    chips report the same internal version as both the LMP sub-version and
    HCI revision number. It always matches, couple that with the manufacturer
    code, that rarely lies, and we now have a good idea of who is who.
    
    Additionally, by compiling a list of user-reported HCI/lsusb dumps, and
    searching around for legit CSR dongles in similar product ranges we can
    find what CSR BlueCore firmware supported which Bluetooth versions.
    
    That way we can narrow down ranges of fakes for each of them.
    
    e.g. Real CSR dongles with LMP subversion 0x73 are old enough that
         support BT 1.1 only; so it's a dead giveaway when some
         third-party BT 4.0 dongle reuses it.
    
    So, to sum things up; there are multiple classes of fake controllers
    reusing the same 0A12:0001 VID/PID. This has been broken for a while.
    
    Known 'fake' bcdDevices: 0x0100, 0x0134, 0x1915, 0x2520, 0x7558, 0x8891
      IC markings on 0x7558: FR3191AHAL 749H15143 (???)

    In theory, a panic can happen after a bus or host reset with dma_started
    flag set. Fix this by halting the DMA before reinitializing the host.
    Don't assume that ms->current_req is set when halt_dma() is invoked as it
    may not hold for bus or host reset.
    
    BTW, this particular Conner drive can be made to work by inhibiting
    disconnect/reselect with 'mesh.resel_targets=0'.

    usb: dwc2: Fix error path in gadget registration
    
    [ Upstream commit 33a06f1300a79cfd461cea0268f05e969d4f34ec ]
    
    When gadget registration fails, one should not call usb_del_gadget_udc().
    Ensure this by setting gadget->udc to NULL. Also in case of a failure
    there is no need to disable low-level hardware, so return immiedetly
    instead of jumping to error_init label.
    
    This fixes the following kernel NULL ptr dereference on gadget failure
    (can be easily triggered with g_mass_storage without any module
    parameters):
    
    dwc2 12480000.hsotg: dwc2_check_params: Invalid parameter besl=1

    ASoC: hdac_hda: fix deadlock after PCM open error
    
    [ Upstream commit 06f07e2365378d51eddd0b5bf23506e1237662b0 ]
    
    Commit 5bd70440cb0a ("ASoC: soc-dai: revert all changes to DAI
    startup/shutdown sequence"), introduced a slight change of semantics
    to DAI startup/shutdown. If startup() returns an error, shutdown()
    is now called for the DAI.
    
    This causes a deadlock in hdac_hda which issues a call to
    snd_hda_codec_pcm_put() in case open fails. Upon error, soc_pcm_open()
    will call shutdown(), and pcm_put() ends up getting called twice. Result
    is a deadlock on pcm->open_mutex, as snd_device_free() gets called from
    within snd_pcm_open(). Typical task backtrace looks like this:

    s390/bpf: Tolerate not converging code shrinking
    
    [ Upstream commit 1491b73311a15bb5beeab5d30e03bff761ef6c18 ]
    
    "BPF_MAXINSNS: Maximum possible literals" unnecessarily falls back to
    the interpreter because of failing sanity check in bpf_set_addr. The
    problem is that there are a lot of branches that can be shrunk, and
    doing so opens up the possibility to shrink even more. This process
    does not converge after 3 passes, causing code offsets to change during
    the codegen pass, which must never happen.
    
    Fix by inserting nops during codegen pass in order to preserve code
    offets.

    Both signed and unsigned variants of BPF_JMP | BPF_K require

    which is correct, and clgfi for the unsigned case, which is not
    correct: clgfi zero-extends the immediate.
    
    s390 does not provide an instruction that does sign-extension and
    unsigned comparison at the same time. Therefore, fix by first loading
    the sign-extended immediate into work register REG_1 and proceeding
    as if it's BPF_X.

    phy: armada-38x: fix NETA lockup when repeatedly switching speeds
    
    [ Upstream commit 1dea06cd643da38931382ebdc151efced201ffad ]
    
    The mvneta hardware appears to lock up in various random ways when
    repeatedly switching speeds between 1G and 2.5G, which involves
    reprogramming the COMPHY.  It is not entirely clear why this happens,
    but best guess is that reprogramming the COMPHY glitches mvneta clocks
    causing the hardware to fail.  It seems that rebooting resolves the
    failure, but not down/up cycling the interface alone.
    
    Various other approaches have been tried, such as trying to cleanly
    power down the COMPHY and then take it back through the power up
    initialisation, but this does not seem to help.
    
    It was finally noticed that u-boot's last step when configuring a
    COMPHY for "SGMII" mode was to poke at a register described as
    "GBE_CONFIGURATION_REG", which is undocumented in any external
    documentation.  All that we have is the fact that u-boot sets a bit
    corresponding to the "SGMII" lane at the end of COMPHY initialisation.
    
    Experimentation shows that if we clear this bit prior to changing the
    speed, and then set it afterwards, mvneta does not suffer this problem
    on the SolidRun Clearfog when switching speeds between 1G and 2.5G.
    
    This problem was found while script-testing phylink.
    
    This fix also requires the corresponding change to DT to be effective.
    See "ARM: dts: armada-38x: fix NETA lockup when repeatedly switching
    speeds".

    [ Upstream commit 3c9450c053f88e525b2db1e6990cdf34d14e7696 ]
    
    Compilation error:
      arch/powerpc/perf/perf_regs.c:80:undefined reference to `.is_sier_available'
    
    Currently is_sier_available() is part of core-book3s.c, which is added
    to build based on CONFIG_PPC_PERF_CTRS.
    
    A config with CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS and without CONFIG_PPC_PERF_CTRS will
    have a build break because of missing is_sier_available().
    
    In practice it only breaks when CONFIG_FSL_EMB_PERF_EVENT=n because
    that also guards the usage of is_sier_available(). That only happens
    with CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3E_64=y and CONFIG_FSL_SOC_BOOKE=n.
    
    Patch adds is_sier_available() in asm/perf_event.h to fix the build
    break for configs missing CONFIG_PPC_PERF_CTRS.

    [ Upstream commit b1b6bed3b5036509b449b5965285d5057ba42527 ]
    
    The function quirks_param_set() takes as argument a const char* pointer
    to the new value of the usbcore.quirks parameter. It then casts this
    pointer to a non-const char* pointer and passes it to the strsep()
    function, which overwrites the value.
    
    Fix this by creating a copy of the value using kstrdup() and letting
    that copy be written to by strsep().

    clk: qcom: gcc: Make disp gpll0 branch aon for sc7180/sdm845
    
    [ Upstream commit 9c3df2b1993da9ab1110702d7b2815d5cd8c02f3 ]
    
    The display gpll0 branch clock inside GCC needs to always be enabled.
    Otherwise the AHB clk (disp_cc_mdss_ahb_clk_src) for the display clk
    controller (dispcc) will stop clocking while sourcing from gpll0 when
    this branch inside GCC is turned off during unused clk disabling. We can
    never turn this branch off because the AHB clk for the display subsystem
    is needed to read/write any registers inside the display subsystem
    including clk related ones. This makes this branch a really easy way to
    turn off AHB access to the display subsystem and cause all sorts of
    mayhem. Let's just make the clk ops keep the clk enabled forever and
    ignore any attempts to disable this clk so that dispcc accesses keep
    working.

    USB: serial: iuu_phoenix: fix led-activity helpers
    
    [ Upstream commit de37458f8c2bfc465500a1dd0d15dbe96d2a698c ]
    
    The set-led command is eight bytes long and starts with a command byte
    followed by six bytes of RGB data and ends with a byte encoding a
    frequency (see iuu_led() and iuu_rgbf_fill_buffer()).
    
    The led activity helpers had a few long-standing bugs which corrupted
    the command packets by inserting a second command byte and thereby
    offsetting the RGB data and dropping the frequency in non-xmas mode.
    
    In xmas mode, a related off-by-one error left the frequency field
    uninitialised.

    spi: lantiq-ssc: Fix warning by using WQ_MEM_RECLAIM
    
    [ Upstream commit ba3548cf29616b58c93bbaffc3d636898d009858 ]
    
    The lantiq-ssc driver uses internally an own workqueue to wait till the
    data is not only written out of the FIFO but really written to the wire.
    This workqueue is flushed while the SPI subsystem is working in some
    other system workqueue.
    
    The system workqueue is marked as WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, but the workqueue in
    the lantiq-ssc driver does not use WQ_MEM_RECLAIM for now. Add this flag
    too to prevent this warning.
    
    This fixes the following warning:
    [    2.975956] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 17 at kernel/workqueue.c:2614 check_flush_dependency+0x168/0x184

    drm/imx: fix use after free
    
    [ Upstream commit ba807c94f67fd64b3051199810d9e4dd209fdc00 ]
    
    Component driver structures allocated with devm_kmalloc() in bind() are
    freed automatically after unbind(). Since the contained drm structures
    are accessed afterwards in drm_mode_config_cleanup(), move the
    allocation into probe() to extend the driver structure's lifetime to the
    lifetime of the device. This should eventually be changed to use drm
    resource managed allocations with lifetime of the drm device.
    
    We also need to ensure that all componets are available during the
    unbind() so we need to call component_unbind_all() before we free
    non-devres resources like planes.
    
    Note this patch fixes the the use after free bug but introduces a
    possible boot loop issue. The issue is triggered if the HDMI support is
    enabled and a component driver always return -EPROBE_DEFER, see
    discussion [1] for more details.

    [ Upstream commit 08b0ad375ca66181faee725b1b358bcae8d592ee ]
    
    If CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ was enabled, r8a77951-salvator-xs could boot
    correctly. If we appended "earlycon keep_bootcon" to the kernel
    command like, we could get kernel log like below.

        lr : free_irq+0xf4/0x27c
    
    This means free_irq() calls the interrupt handler while PM runtime
    is not getting if DEBUG_SHIRQ is enabled and rcar_gen3_phy_usb2_probe()
    failed. To fix the issue, move the irq registration place to
    rcar_gen3_phy_usb2_init() which is ready to handle the interrupts.
    
    Note that after the commit 549b6b55b005 ("phy: renesas: rcar-gen3-usb2:
    enable/disable independent irqs") which is merged into v5.2, since this
    driver creates multiple phy instances, needs to check whether one of
    phy instances is initialized. However, if we backport this patch to v5.1
    or less, we don't need to check it because such kernel have single
    phy instance.

    [ Upstream commit bd054ece7d9cdd88e900df6625e951a01d9f655e ]
    
    axg_card_add_tdm_loopback() misses to call kfree() in an error path. We
    can use devm_kasprintf() to fix the issue, also improve maintainability.
    So use it instead.

    Currently the masking of ret with 0xff and followed by a right shift
    of 8 bits always leaves a zero result.  It appears the mask of 0xff
    is incorrect and should be 0xff00, but I don't have the hardware to

    ima: Fail rule parsing when the KEXEC_CMDLINE hook is combined with an invalid cond
    
    [ Upstream commit db2045f5892a9db7354442bf77f9b03b50ff9ee1 ]
    
    The KEXEC_CMDLINE hook function only supports the pcr conditional. Make
    this clear at policy load so that IMA policy authors don't assume that
    other conditionals are supported.
    
    Since KEXEC_CMDLINE's inception, ima_match_rules() has always returned
    true on any loaded KEXEC_CMDLINE rule without any consideration for
    other conditionals present in the rule. Make it clear that pcr is the
    only supported KEXEC_CMDLINE conditional by returning an error during
    policy load.
    
    An example of why this is a problem can be explained with the following
    rule:
    
     dont_measure func=KEXEC_CMDLINE obj_type=foo_t
    
    An IMA policy author would have assumed that rule is valid because the
    parser accepted it but the result was that measurements for all
    KEXEC_CMDLINE operations would be disabled.

    ima: Fail rule parsing when buffer hook functions have an invalid action
    
    [ Upstream commit 712183437ebebc89cd086ef96cf9a521fd97fd09 ]
    
    Buffer based hook functions, such as KEXEC_CMDLINE and KEY_CHECK, can
    only measure. The process_buffer_measurement() function quietly ignores
    all actions except measure so make this behavior clear at the time of
    policy load.
    
    The parsing of the keyrings conditional had a check to ensure that it
    was only specified with measure actions but the check should be on the
    hook function and not the keyrings conditional since
    "appraise func=KEY_CHECK" is not a valid rule.

    powerpc/rtas: don't online CPUs for partition suspend
    
    [ Upstream commit ec2fc2a9e9bbad9023aab65bc472ce7a3ca8608f ]
    
    Partition suspension, used for hibernation and migration, requires
    that the OS place all but one of the LPAR's processor threads into one
    of two states prior to calling the ibm,suspend-me RTAS function:
    
      * the architected offline state (via RTAS stop-self); or
      * the H_JOIN hcall, which does not return until the partition
        resumes execution
    
    Using H_CEDE as the offline mode, introduced by
    commit 3aa565f53c39 ("powerpc/pseries: Add hooks to put the CPU into
    an appropriate offline state"), means that any threads which are
    offline from Linux's point of view must be moved to one of those two
    states before a partition suspension can proceed.
    
    This was eventually addressed in commit 120496ac2d2d ("powerpc: Bring
    all threads online prior to migration/hibernation"), which added code
    to temporarily bring up any offline processor threads so they can call
    H_JOIN. Conceptually this is fine, but the implementation has had
    multiple races with cpu hotplug operations initiated from user
    space[1][2][3], the error handling is fragile, and it generates
    user-visible cpu hotplug events which is a lot of noise for a platform
    feature that's supposed to minimize disruption to workloads.
    
    With commit 3aa565f53c39 ("powerpc/pseries: Add hooks to put the CPU
    into an appropriate offline state") reverted, this code becomes
    unnecessary, so remove it. Since any offline CPUs now are truly
    offline from the platform's point of view, it is no longer necessary
    to bring up CPUs only to have them call H_JOIN and then go offline
    again upon resuming. Only active threads are required to call H_JOIN;
    stopped threads can be left alone.

    powerpc/pseries: remove cede offline state for CPUs
    
    [ Upstream commit 48f6e7f6d948b56489da027bc3284c709b939d28 ]
    
    This effectively reverts commit 3aa565f53c39 ("powerpc/pseries: Add
    hooks to put the CPU into an appropriate offline state"), which added
    an offline mode for CPUs which uses the H_CEDE hcall instead of the
    architected stop-self RTAS function in order to facilitate "folding"
    of dedicated mode processors on PowerVM platforms to achieve energy
    savings. This has been the default offline mode since its
    introduction.
    
    There's nothing about stop-self that would prevent the hypervisor from
    achieving the energy savings available via H_CEDE, so the original
    premise of this change appears to be flawed.
    
    I also have encountered the claim that the transition to and from
    ceded state is much faster than stop-self/start-cpu. Certainly we
    would not want to use stop-self as an *idle* mode. That is what H_CEDE
    is for. However, this difference is insignificant in the context of
    Linux CPU hotplug, where the latency of an offline or online operation
    on current systems is on the order of 100ms, mainly attributable to
    all the various subsystems' cpuhp callbacks.
    
    The cede offline mode also prevents accurate accounting, as discussed
    before:
    https://lore.kernel.org/linuxppc-dev/1571740391-3251-1-git-send-email-ego@linux.vnet.ibm.com/
    
    Unconditionally use stop-self to offline processor threads. This is
    the architected method for offlining CPUs on PAPR systems.
    
    The "cede_offline" boot parameter is rendered obsolete.
    
    Removing this code enables the removal of the partition suspend code
    which temporarily onlines all present CPUs.

    kernfs: do not call fsnotify() with name without a parent
    
    [ Upstream commit 9991bb84b27a2594187898f261866cfc50255454 ]
    
    When creating an FS_MODIFY event on inode itself (not on parent)
    the file_name argument should be NULL.
    
    The change to send a non NULL name to inode itself was done on purpuse
    as part of another commit, as Tejun writes: "...While at it, supply the
    target file name to fsnotify() from kernfs_node->name.".
    
    But this is wrong practice and inconsistent with inotify behavior when
    watching a single file.  When a child is being watched (as opposed to the
    parent directory) the inotify event should contain the watch descriptor,
    but not the file name.

    kobject: Avoid premature parent object freeing in kobject_cleanup()
    
    [ Upstream commit 079ad2fb4bf9eba8a0aaab014b49705cd7f07c66 ]
    
    If kobject_del() is invoked by kobject_cleanup() to delete the
    target kobject, it may cause its parent kobject to be freed
    before invoking the target kobject's ->release() method, which
    effectively means freeing the parent before dealing with the
    child entirely.
    
    That is confusing at best and it may also lead to functional
    issues if the callers of kobject_cleanup() are not careful enough
    about the order in which these calls are made, so avoid the
    problem by making kobject_cleanup() drop the last reference to
    the target kobject's parent at the end, after invoking the target
    kobject's ->release() method.

    the LTDC might suspend via runtime PM, disable clock, and then fail
    to resume later on.
    
    The test which triggers it is roughly -- run qt5 application which
    uses eglfs platform and etnaviv, stop the application, sleep for 15
    minutes, run the application again. This leads to a timeout waiting
    for vsync, because the LTDC has suspended, but did not resume.

    samples: bpf: Fix bpf programs with kprobe/sys_connect event
    
    [ Upstream commit af9bd3e3331b8af42b6606c75797d041ab39380c ]
    
    Currently, BPF programs with kprobe/sys_connect does not work properly.
    
    Commit 34745aed515c ("samples/bpf: fix kprobe attachment issue on x64")
    This commit modifies the bpf_load behavior of kprobe events in the x64
    architecture. If the current kprobe event target starts with "sys_*",
    add the prefix "__x64_" to the front of the event.
    
    Appending "__x64_" prefix with kprobe/sys_* event was appropriate as a
    solution to most of the problems caused by the commit below.
    
        commit d5a00528b58c ("syscalls/core, syscalls/x86: Rename struct
        pt_regs-based sys_*() to __x64_sys_*()")
    
    However, there is a problem with the sys_connect kprobe event that does
    not work properly. For __sys_connect event, parameters can be fetched
    normally, but for __x64_sys_connect, parameters cannot be fetched.
    
        ffffffff818d3520 <__x64_sys_connect>:
        ffffffff818d3520: e8 fb df 32 00        callq   0xffffffff81c01520
        <__fentry__>
        ffffffff818d3525: 48 8b 57 60           movq    96(%rdi), %rdx
        ffffffff818d3529: 48 8b 77 68           movq    104(%rdi), %rsi
        ffffffff818d352d: 48 8b 7f 70           movq    112(%rdi), %rdi
        ffffffff818d3531: e8 1a ff ff ff        callq   0xffffffff818d3450

        ffffffff818d3539: 0f 1f 80 00 00 00 00  nopl    (%rax)
    
    As the assembly code for __x64_sys_connect shows, parameters should be
    fetched and set into rdi, rsi, rdx registers prior to calling
    __sys_connect.
    
    Because of this problem, this commit fixes the sys_connect event by
    first getting the value of the rdi register and then the value of the
    rdi, rsi, and rdx register through an offset based on that value.

    PCI: Fix pci_cfg_wait queue locking problem
    
    [ Upstream commit 2a7e32d0547f41c5ce244f84cf5d6ca7fccee7eb ]
    
    The pci_cfg_wait queue is used to prevent user-space config accesses to
    devices while they are recovering from reset.
    
    Previously we used these operations on pci_cfg_wait:
    
      __add_wait_queue(&pci_cfg_wait, ...)
      __remove_wait_queue(&pci_cfg_wait, ...)
      wake_up_all(&pci_cfg_wait)
    
    The wake_up acquires the wait queue lock, but the add and remove do not.
    
    Originally these were all protected by the pci_lock, but cdcb33f98244
    ("PCI: Avoid possible deadlock on pci_lock and p->pi_lock"), moved
    wake_up_all() outside pci_lock, so it could race with add/remove
    operations, which caused occasional kernel panics, e.g., during vfio-pci
    hotplug/unplug testing:
    
      Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory at virtual address ffff802dac469000
    
    Resolve this by using wait_event() instead of __add_wait_queue() and
    __remove_wait_queue().  The wait queue lock is held by both wait_event()
    and wake_up_all(), so it provides mutual exclusion.

    RDMA/rxe: Skip dgid check in loopback mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c99274be8864519328aa74bc550ba410095bc1c ]
    
    In the loopback tests, the following call trace occurs.
    
     Call Trace:

    To fix this call trace which appear in the loopback tests, skip check of
    the dgid.

    xfs: fix reflink quota reservation accounting error
    
    [ Upstream commit 83895227aba1ade33e81f586aa7b6b1e143096a5 ]
    
    Quota reservations are supposed to account for the blocks that might be

    this to make the quota accounting more accurate before we start

    xfs: don't eat an EIO/ENOSPC writeback error when scrubbing data fork
    
    [ Upstream commit eb0efe5063bb10bcb653e4f8e92a74719c03a347 ]
    
    The data fork scrubber calls filemap_write_and_wait to flush dirty pages
    and delalloc reservations out to disk prior to checking the data fork's
    extent mappings.  Unfortunately, this means that scrub can consume the
    EIO/ENOSPC errors that would otherwise have stayed around in the address
    space until (we hope) the writer application calls fsync to persist data
    and collect errors.  The end result is that programs that wrote to a
    file might never see the error code and proceed as if nothing were
    wrong.
    
    xfs_scrub is not in a position to notify file writers about the
    writeback failure, and it's only here to check metadata, not file
    contents.  Therefore, if writeback fails, we should stuff the error code
    back into the address space so that an fsync by the writer application
    can pick that up.

    media: cros-ec-cec: do not bail on device_init_wakeup failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 6f01dfb760c027d5dd6199d91ee9599f2676b5c6 ]
    
    Do not fail probing when device_init_wakeup fails.
    
    device_init_wakeup fails when the device is already enabled as wakeup
    device. Hence, the driver fails to probe the device if:
    - The device has already been enabled for wakeup (by e.g. sysfs)
    - The driver has been unloaded and is being loaded again.
    
    This goal of the patch is to fix the above cases.
    
    Overwhelming majority of the drivers do not check device_init_wakeup
    return code.

    ipvs: allow connection reuse for unconfirmed conntrack
    
    [ Upstream commit f0a5e4d7a594e0fe237d3dfafb069bb82f80f42f ]
    
    YangYuxi is reporting that connection reuse
    is causing one-second delay when SYN hits
    existing connection in TIME_WAIT state.
    Such delay was added to give time to expire
    both the IPVS connection and the corresponding
    conntrack. This was considered a rare case
    at that time but it is causing problem for
    some environments such as Kubernetes.
    
    As nf_conntrack_tcp_packet() can decide to
    release the conntrack in TIME_WAIT state and
    to replace it with a fresh NEW conntrack, we
    can use this to allow rescheduling just by
    tuning our check: if the conntrack is
    confirmed we can not schedule it to different
    real server and the one-second delay still
    applies but if new conntrack was created,
    we are free to select new real server without
    any delays.
    
    YangYuxi lists some of the problem reports:
    
    - One second connection delay in masquerading mode:

    RDMA/core: Fix bogus WARN_ON during ib_unregister_device_queued()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0cb42c0265837fafa2b4f302c8a7fed2631d7869 ]
    
    ib_unregister_device_queued() can only be used by drivers using the new
    dealloc_device callback flow, and it has a safety WARN_ON to ensure
    drivers are using it properly.
    
    However, if unregister and register are raced there is a special
    destruction path that maintains the uniform error handling semantic of
    'caller does ib_dealloc_device() on failure'. This requires disabling the
    dealloc_device callback which triggers the WARN_ON.
    
    Instead of using NULL to disable the callback use a special function
    pointer so the WARN_ON does not trigger.

    drm/amdgpu: ensure 0 is returned for success in jpeg_v2_5_wait_for_idle
    
    [ Upstream commit 57f01856645afe4c3d0f9915ee2bb043e8dd7982 ]
    
    In the cases where adev->jpeg.num_jpeg_inst is zero or the condition
    adev->jpeg.harvest_config & (1 << i) is always non-zero the variable
    ret is never set to an error condition and the function returns
    an uninitialized value in ret.  Since the only exit condition at
    the end if the function is a success then explicitly return
    0 rather than a potentially uninitialized value in ret.

    tracing: Move pipe reference to trace array instead of current_tracer
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ef282e05132d56b6f6b71e3873f317664bea78b ]
    
    If a process has the trace_pipe open on a trace_array, the current tracer
    for that trace array should not be changed. This was original enforced by a
    global lock, but when instances were introduced, it was moved to the
    current_trace. But this structure is shared by all instances, and a
    trace_pipe is for a single instance. There's no reason that a process that
    has trace_pipe open on one instance should prevent another instance from
    changing its current tracer. Move the reference counter to the trace_array
    instead.
    
    This is marked as "Fixes" but is more of a clean up than a true fix.
    Backport if you want, but its not critical.

    lkdtm: Avoid more compiler optimizations for bad writes
    
    [ Upstream commit 464e86b4abadfc490f426954b431e2ec6a9d7bd2 ]
    
    It seems at least Clang is able to throw away writes it knows are
    destined for read-only memory, which makes things like the WRITE_RO test
    fail, as the write gets elided. Instead, force the variable to be
    volatile, and make similar changes through-out other tests in an effort
    to avoid needing to repeat fixing these kinds of problems. Also includes
    pr_err() calls in failure paths so that kernel logs are more clear in
    the failure case.

    drm/panfrost: Fix inbalance of devfreq record_busy/idle()
    
    [ Upstream commit b99773ef258e628bd53cab22d450a755b73b4d55 ]
    
    The calls to panfrost_devfreq_record_busy() and
    panfrost_devfreq_record_idle() must be balanced to ensure that the
    devfreq utilisation is correctly reported. But there are two cases where
    this doesn't work correctly.
    
    In panfrost_job_hw_submit() if pm_runtime_get_sync() fails or the
    WARN_ON() fires then no call to panfrost_devfreq_record_busy() is made,
    but when the job times out the corresponding _record_idle() call is
    still made in panfrost_job_timedout(). Move the call up to ensure that
    it always happens.
    
    Secondly panfrost_job_timedout() only makes a single call to
    panfrost_devfreq_record_idle() even if it is cleaning up multiple jobs.
    Move the call inside the loop to ensure that the number of
    _record_idle() calls matches the number of _record_busy() calls.

    scsi: ufs: Fix imprecise load calculation in devfreq window
    
    [ Upstream commit b1bf66d1d5a8fcb54f0e584db5d196ef015b5172 ]
    
    The UFS load calculation is based on "total_time" and "busy_time" in a
    devfreq window.  However, the source of time is different for both
    parameters: "busy_time" is assigned from "jiffies" thus has different
    accuracy from "total_time" which is assigned from ktime_get().
    
    In addition, the time of window boundary is not exactly the same as the
    starting busy time in this window if UFS is actually busy in the beginning
    of the window. A similar accuracy error may also happen for the end of busy
    time in current window.
    
    To guarantee the precision of load calculation, we need to
    
    1. Align time accuracy of both devfreq_dev_status.total_time and
       devfreq_dev_status.busy_time. For example, use "ktime_get()" directly.
    
    2. Align the following timelines:
       - The beginning time of devfreq windows
       - The beginning of busy time in a new window
       - The end of busy time in the current window

    pointers on error and NULL then the NULL return means that the optional
    feature is deliberately disabled.  It is a special sort of success and
    should not trigger an error message.  The surrounding code should be
    written to check for NULL and not crash.
    
    On the other hand, if we encounter an error, then the probe from should
    clean up and return a failure.
    
    In this code, if devm_clk_get_optional() returns an error pointer then
    the kernel will crash inside the call to:
    
            clk_set_rate(qcadev->susclk, SUSCLK_RATE_32KHZ);
    
    The error handling must be updated to prevent that.

    ACPICA: Do not increment operation_region reference counts for field units
    
    [ Upstream commit 6a54ebae6d047c988a31f5ac5a64ab5cf83797a2 ]
    
    ACPICA commit e17b28cfcc31918d0db9547b6b274b09c413eb70
    
    Object reference counts are used as a part of ACPICA's garbage
    collection mechanism. This mechanism keeps track of references to
    heap-allocated structures such as the ACPI operand objects.
    
    Recent server firmware has revealed that this reference count can
    overflow on large servers that declare many field units under the
    same operation_region. This occurs because each field unit declaration
    will add a reference count to the source operation_region.
    
    This change solves the reference count overflow for operation_regions
    objects by preventing fieldunits from incrementing their
    operation_region's reference count. Each operation_region's reference
    count will not be changed by named objects declared under the Field
    operator. During namespace deletion, the operation_region namespace
    node will be deleted and each fieldunit will be deleted without
    touching the deleted operation_region object.

    [CAUSE]
    Normally per-trans qgroup reserved space is freed when a transaction is
    committed, in commit_fs_roots().
    
    However for completely dropped subvolume, that subvolume is completely
    gone, thus is no longer in the fs_roots_radix, and its per-trans
    reserved qgroup will never be freed.
    
    Since the subvolume is already gone, leaked per-trans space won't cause
    any trouble for end users.
    
    [FIX]
    Just call btrfs_qgroup_free_meta_all_pertrans() before a subvolume is
    completely dropped.

    btrfs: allow btrfs_truncate_block() to fallback to nocow for data space reservation
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d4572a9d71d5fc2affee0258d8582d39859188c ]
    
    [BUG]
    When the data space is exhausted, even if the inode has NOCOW attribute,
    we will still refuse to truncate unaligned range due to ENOSPC.
    
    The following script can reproduce it pretty easily:
      #!/bin/bash
    
      dev=/dev/test/test
      mnt=/mnt/btrfs
    
      umount $dev &> /dev/null
      umount $mnt &> /dev/null
    
      mkfs.btrfs -f $dev -b 1G
      mount -o nospace_cache $dev $mnt
      touch $mnt/foobar
      chattr +C $mnt/foobar
    
      xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -b 4k 0 4k" $mnt/foobar > /dev/null
      xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -b 4k 0 1G" $mnt/padding &> /dev/null
      sync
    
      xfs_io -c "fpunch 0 2k" $mnt/foobar
      umount $mnt
    
    Currently this will fail at the fpunch part.
    
    [CAUSE]
    Because btrfs_truncate_block() always reserves space without checking
    the NOCOW attribute.
    
    Since the writeback path follows NOCOW bit, we only need to bother the
    space reservation code in btrfs_truncate_block().
    
    [FIX]
    Make btrfs_truncate_block() follow btrfs_buffered_write() to try to
    reserve data space first, and fall back to NOCOW check only when we
    don't have enough space.
    
    Such always-try-reserve is an optimization introduced in
    btrfs_buffered_write(), to avoid expensive btrfs_check_can_nocow() call.
    
    This patch will export check_can_nocow() as btrfs_check_can_nocow(), and
    use it in btrfs_truncate_block() to fix the problem.

    bcache: fix super block seq numbers comparision in register_cache_set()
    
    [ Upstream commit 117f636ea695270fe492d0c0c9dfadc7a662af47 ]
    
    In register_cache_set(), c is pointer to struct cache_set, and ca is
    pointer to struct cache, if ca->sb.seq > c->sb.seq, it means this
    registering cache has up to date version and other members, the in-
    memory version and other members should be updated to the newer value.
    
    But current implementation makes a cache set only has a single cache
    device, so the above assumption works well except for a special case.
    The execption is when a cache device new created and both ca->sb.seq and
    c->sb.seq are 0, because the super block is never flushed out yet. In
    the location for the following if() check,
    2156         if (ca->sb.seq > c->sb.seq) {
    2157                 c->sb.version           = ca->sb.version;
    2158                 memcpy(c->sb.set_uuid, ca->sb.set_uuid, 16);
    2159                 c->sb.flags             = ca->sb.flags;
    2160                 c->sb.seq               = ca->sb.seq;
    2161                 pr_debug("set version = %llu\n", c->sb.version);
    2162         }
    c->sb.version is not initialized yet and valued 0. When ca->sb.seq is 0,
    the if() check will fail (because both values are 0), and the cache set
    version, set_uuid, flags and seq won't be updated.
    
    The above problem is hiden for current code, because the bucket size is
    compatible among different super block version. And the next time when
    running cache set again, ca->sb.seq will be larger than 0 and cache set
    super block version will be updated properly.
    
    But if the large bucket feature is enabled,  sb->bucket_size is the low
    16bits of the bucket size. For a power of 2 value, when the actual
    bucket size exceeds 16bit width, sb->bucket_size will always be 0. Then
    read_super_common() will fail because the if() check to
    is_power_of_2(sb->bucket_size) is false. This is how the long time
    hidden bug is triggered.
    
    This patch modifies the if() check to the following way,
    2156         if (ca->sb.seq > c->sb.seq || c->sb.seq == 0) {
    Then cache set's version, set_uuid, flags and seq will always be updated
    corectly including for a new created cache device.

    dyndbg: fix a BUG_ON in ddebug_describe_flags
    
    [ Upstream commit f678ce8cc3cb2ad29df75d8824c74f36398ba871 ]
    
    ddebug_describe_flags() currently fills a caller provided string buffer,
    after testing its size (also passed) in a BUG_ON.  Fix this by
    replacing them with a known-big-enough string buffer wrapped in a
    struct, and passing that instead.
    
    Also simplify ddebug_describe_flags() flags parameter from a struct to
    a member in that struct, and hoist the member deref up to the caller.
    This makes the function reusable (soon) where flags are unpacked.

    [ Upstream commit 5fc453d7de3d0c345812453823a3a56783c5f82c ]
    
    GISB bus error kernel panics have been observed during S2 transition
    tests on the 7271t platform. The errors are a result of the BDC
    interrupt handler trying to access BDC register space after the
    system's suspend callbacks have completed.
    
    Adding a suspend hook to the BDC driver that halts the controller before
    S2 entry thus preventing unwanted access to the BDC register space during
    this transition.

    Multiple connects/disconnects can cause a crash on the second
    disconnect. The driver had a problem where it would try to send
    endpoint commands after it was disconnected which is not allowed
    by the hardware. The fix is to only allow the endpoint commands
    when the endpoint is connected. This will also fix issues that
    showed up when using configfs to create gadgets.

    x86/uaccess: Make __get_user_size() Clang compliant on 32-bit
    
    [ Upstream commit 158807de5822d1079e162a3762956fd743dd483e ]
    
    Clang fails to compile __get_user_size() on 32-bit for the following code:
    
          long long val;
    
          __get_user(val, usrptr);
    
    with: error: invalid output size for constraint '=q'
    
    GCC compiles the same code without complaints.
    
    The reason is that GCC and Clang are architecturally different, which leads
    to subtle issues for code that's invalid but clearly dead, i.e. with code
    that emulates polymorphism with the preprocessor and sizeof.
    
    GCC will perform semantic analysis after early inlining and dead code
    elimination, so it will not warn on invalid code that's dead. Clang
    strictly performs optimizations after semantic analysis, so it will warn
    for dead code.
    
    Neither Clang nor GCC like this very much with -m32:
    
    long long ret;
    asm ("movb $5, %0" : "=q" (ret));
    
    However, GCC can tolerate this variant:
    
    long long ret;
    switch (sizeof(ret)) {
    case 1:
            asm ("movb $5, %0" : "=q" (ret));
            break;
    case 8:;
    }
    
    Clang, on the other hand, won't accept that because it validates the inline
    asm for the '1' case before the optimisation phase where it realises that
    it wouldn't have to emit it anyway.
    
    If LLVM (Clang's "back end") fails such as during instruction selection or
    register allocation, it cannot provide accurate diagnostics (warnings /
    errors) that contain line information, as the AST has been discarded from
    memory at that point.
    
    While there have been early discussions about having C/C++ specific
    language optimizations in Clang via the use of MLIR, which would enable
    such earlier optimizations, such work is not scoped and likely a multi-year
    endeavor.
    
    It was discussed to change the asm output constraint for the one byte case
    from "=q" to "=r". While it works for 64-bit, it fails on 32-bit. With '=r'
    the compiler could fail to chose a register accessible as high/low which is
    required for the byte operation. If that happens the assembly will fail.
    
    Use a local temporary variable of type 'unsigned char' as output for the
    byte copy inline asm and then assign it to the real output variable. This
    prevents Clang from failing the semantic analysis in the above case.
    
    The resulting code for the actual one byte copy is not affected as the
    temporary variable is optimized out.

    On failure pcie_capability_read_dword() sets it's last parameter, val
    to 0. However, with Patch 14/14, it is possible that val is set to ~0 on
    failure. This would introduce a bug because (x & x) == (~0 & x).
    
    This bug can be avoided without changing the function's behaviour if the
    return value of pcie_capability_read_dword is checked to confirm success.
    
    Check the return value of pcie_capability_read_dword() to ensure success.

    In brcmf_fws_bus_txq_cleanup it already sets
    BRCMF_FWS_HANGER_ITEM_STATE_FREE before freeing skb, therefore we add the
    same thing in brcmf_fws_psq_flush to avoid following warning message.

    brcmfmac: keep SDIO watchdog running when console_interval is non-zero
    
    [ Upstream commit eccbf46b15bb3e35d004148f7c3a8fa8e9b26c1e ]
    
    brcmfmac host driver makes SDIO bus sleep and stops SDIO watchdog if no
    pending event or data. As a result, host driver does not poll firmware
    console buffer before buffer overflow, which leads to missing firmware
    logs. We should not stop SDIO watchdog if console_interval is non-zero
    in debug build.

    [ Upstream commit eec3303de3378cdfaa0bb86f43546dbbd88f94e2 ]
    
    [Why]
    DC is very fast at link training and stream enablement
    which causes issues such as blackscreens for non-compliant
    monitors.
    
    [How]
    After debugging with scaler vendors we implement the
    minimum delays at the necessary locations to ensure
    the monitor does not hang.  Delays are generic due to
    lack of IEEE OUI information on the failing displays.

    net: phy: mscc: restore the base page in vsc8514/8584_config_init
    
    [ Upstream commit 6119dda34e5d0821959e37641b287576826b6378 ]
    
    In the vsc8584_config_init and vsc8514_config_init, the base page is set
    to 'GPIO', configuration is done, and the page is never explicitly
    restored to the standard page. No bug was triggered as it turns out
    helpers called in those config_init functions do modify the base page,
    and set it back to standard. But that is dangerous and any modification
    to those functions would introduce bugs. This patch fixes this, to
    improve maintenance, by restoring the base page to 'standard' once
    'GPIO' accesses are completed.

    [ Upstream commit c704b17071c4dc571dca3af4e4151dac51de081a ]
    
    Using plain echo to set the "force" connector attribute fails with

    drm/msm: Fix a null pointer access in msm_gem_shrinker_count()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3cbdc8d8b7f39a7af3ea7b8dfa75caaebfda4e56 ]
    
    Adding an msm_gem_object object to the inactive_list before completing
    its initialization is a bad idea because shrinker may pick it up from the
    inactive_list. Fix this by making sure that the initialization is complete
    before moving the msm_obj object to the inactive list.
    
    This patch fixes the below error:

    drm: msm: a6xx: fix gpu failure after system resume
    
    [ Upstream commit 57c0bd517c06b088106b0236ed604056c8e06da5 ]
    
    On targets where GMU is available, GMU takes over the ownership of GX GDSC
    during its initialization. So, move the refcount-get on GX PD before we
    initialize the GMU. This ensures that nobody can collapse the GX GDSC
    once GMU owns the GX GDSC. This patch fixes some GMU OOB errors seen
    during GPU wake up during a system resume.

    This is because we're holding the block_group->lock while trying to dump

    mmc: sdhci-cadence: do not use hardware tuning for SD mode
    
    [ Upstream commit adc40a5179df30421a5537bfeb4545100ab97d5e ]
    
    As commit ef6b75671b5f ("mmc: sdhci-cadence: send tune request twice to
    work around errata") stated, this IP has an errata. This commit applies
    the second workaround for the SD mode.
    
    Due to the errata, it is not possible to use the hardware tuning provided
    by SDHCI_HOST_CONTROL2.
    
    Use the software-controlled tuning like the eMMC mode.
    
    Set sdhci_host_ops::platform_execute_tuning instead of overriding
    mmc_host_ops::execute_tuning.

    memory: samsung: exynos5422-dmc: Do not ignore return code of regmap_read()
    
    [ Upstream commit c4f16e96d8fdd62ef12898fc0965c42093bed237 ]
    
    Check for regmap_read() return code before using the read value in
    following write in exynos5_switch_timing_regs().  Pass reading error
    code to the callers.
    
    This does not introduce proper error handling for such failed reads (and
    obviously regmap_write() error is still ignored) because the driver
    ignored this in all places.  Therefor it only fixes reported issue while
    matching current driver coding style:

    While we expose the ability to turn off hardware dithering for nouveau,
    we actually make the mistake of turning it on anyway, due to
    dithering_depth containing a non-zero value if our dithering depth isn't
    also set to 6 bpc.
    
    So, fix it by never enabling dithering when it's disabled.

    neofb_probe() calls neo_scan_monitor() that can successfully allocate a
    memory for info->monspecs.modedb and proceed to case 0x03. There it does
    not free the memory and returns -1. neofb_probe() goes to label
    err_scan_monitor, thus, it does not free this memory through calling
    fb_destroy_modedb() as well. We can not go to label err_init_hw since
    neo_scan_monitor() can fail during memory allocation. So, the patch frees
    the memory directly for case 0x03.

    Craig Topper suggested me in ClangBuiltLinux issue #1050:
    
    > I think the "too many positional arguments" is because the parser isn't able
    > to handle the trailing commas.
    >
    > The "unknown use of instruction mnemonic" is because the macro was named
    > GHASH_4_ENCRYPT_4_PARALLEL_DEC but its being instantiated with
    > GHASH_4_ENCRYPT_4_PARALLEL_dec I guess gas ignores case on the
    > macro instantiation, but llvm doesn't.
    
    First, I removed the trailing comma in the PRECOMPUTE line.
    
    Second, I substituted:
    1. GHASH_4_ENCRYPT_4_PARALLEL_DEC -> GHASH_4_ENCRYPT_4_PARALLEL_dec
    2. GHASH_4_ENCRYPT_4_PARALLEL_ENC -> GHASH_4_ENCRYPT_4_PARALLEL_enc
    
    With these changes I was able to build with LLVM_IAS=1 and boot on bare metal.
    
    I confirmed that this works with Linux-kernel v5.7.5 final.
    
    NOTE: This patch is on top of Linux v5.7 final.
    
    Thanks to Craig and especially Nick for double-checking and his comments.

    ARM: exynos: clear L310_AUX_CTRL_FULL_LINE_ZERO in default l2c_aux_val
    
    [ Upstream commit 5b17a04addc29201dc142c8d2c077eb7745d2e35 ]
    
    This "alert" error message can be seen on exynos4412-odroidx2:
    
        L2C: platform modifies aux control register: 0x02070000 -> 0x3e470001
        L2C: platform provided aux values permit register corruption.
    
    Followed by this plain error message:
    
        L2C-310: enabling full line of zeros but not enabled in Cortex-A9
    
    To fix it, don't set the L310_AUX_CTRL_FULL_LINE_ZERO flag (bit 0) in
    the default value of l2c_aux_val.  It may instead be enabled when
    applicable by the logic in l2c310_enable() if the attribute
    "arm,full-line-zero-disable" was set in the device tree.
    
    The initial commit that introduced this default value was in v2.6.38
    commit 1cf0eb799759 ("ARM: S5PV310: Add L2 cache init function in
    cpu.c").
    
    However, the code to set the L310_AUX_CTRL_FULL_LINE_ZERO flag and
    manage that feature was added much later and the default value was not
    updated then.  So this seems to have been a subtle oversight
    especially since enabling it only in the cache and not in the A9 core
    doesn't actually prevent the platform from running.  According to the
    TRM, the opposite would be a real issue, if the feature was enabled in
    the A9 core but not in the cache controller.

    net: mscc: ocelot: fix encoding destination ports into multicast IPv4 address
    
    [ Upstream commit 0897ecf7532577bda3dbcb043ce046a96948889d ]
    
    The ocelot hardware designers have made some hacks to support multicast
    IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Normally, the MAC table matches on MAC
    addresses and the destination ports are selected through the DEST_IDX
    field of the respective MAC table entry. The DEST_IDX points to a Port
    Group ID (PGID) which contains the bit mask of ports that frames should
    be forwarded to. But there aren't a lot of PGIDs (only 80 or so) and
    there are clearly many more IP multicast addresses than that, so it
    doesn't scale to use this PGID mechanism, so something else was done.
    Since the first portion of the MAC address is known, the hack they did
    was to use a single PGID for _flooding_ unknown IPv4 multicast
    (PGID_MCIPV4 == 62), but for known IP multicast, embed the destination
    ports into the first 3 bytes of the MAC address recorded in the MAC
    table.
    
    The VSC7514 datasheet explains it like this:
    
        3.9.1.5 IPv4 Multicast Entries
    
        MAC table entries with the ENTRY_TYPE = 2 settings are interpreted
        as IPv4 multicast entries.
        IPv4 multicasts entries match IPv4 frames, which are classified to
        the specified VID, and which have DMAC = 0x01005Exxxxxx, where
        xxxxxx is the lower 24 bits of the MAC address in the entry.
        Instead of a lookup in the destination mask table (PGID), the
        destination set is programmed as part of the entry MAC address. This
        is shown in the following table.
    
        Table 78: IPv4 Multicast Destination Mask
    
            Destination Ports            Record Bit Field
            ---------------------------------------------
            Ports 10-0                   MAC[34-24]
    
        Example: All IPv4 multicast frames in VLAN 12 with MAC 01005E112233 are
        to be forwarded to ports 3, 8, and 9. This is done by inserting the
        following entry in the MAC table entry:
        VALID = 1
        VID = 12
        MAC = 0x000308112233
        ENTRY_TYPE = 2
        DEST_IDX = 0
    
    But this procedure is not at all what's going on in the driver. In fact,
    the code that embeds the ports into the MAC address looks like it hasn't
    actually been tested. This patch applies the procedure described in the
    datasheet.
    
    Since there are many other fixes to be made around multicast forwarding
    until it works properly, there is no real reason for this patch to be
    backported to stable trees, or considered a real fix of something that
    should have worked.

    rpmh-rsc driver is fairly core to system and should not be removable
    once its probed. However it allows to unbind driver from sysfs using
    below command which results into a crash on sc7180.
    
    echo 18200000.rsc > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/rpmh/unbind
    
    Lets prevent unbind at runtime by setting suppress_bind_attrs flag.

    When the device is already gone we end up with the following scenario:
    The device's capacity is 0 and thus the number of zones will be 0 as well. When
    allocating the bitmap for the conventional zones, we then trip over a NULL
    pointer.
    
    So if we encounter a zoned block device with a 0 capacity, don't dare to
    revalidate the zones sizes.

    nvme-rdma: fix controller reset hang during traffic
    
    [ Upstream commit 9f98772ba307dd89a3d17dc2589f213d3972fc64 ]
    
    commit fe35ec58f0d3 ("block: update hctx map when use multiple maps")
    exposed an issue where we may hang trying to wait for queue freeze
    during I/O. We call blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues which in case of multiple
    queue maps (which we have now for default/read/poll) is attempting to
    freeze the queue. However we never started queue freeze when starting the
    reset, which means that we have inflight pending requests that entered the
    queue that we will not complete once the queue is quiesced.
    
    So start a freeze before we quiesce the queue, and unfreeze the queue
    after we successfully connected the I/O queues (and make sure to call
    blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues only after we are sure that the queue was
    already frozen).
    
    This follows to how the pci driver handles resets.

    arm64: dts: meson: fix mmc0 tuning error on Khadas VIM3
    
    [ Upstream commit f1bb924e8f5b50752a80fa5b48c43003680a7b64 ]
    
    Similar to other G12B devices using the W400 dtsi, I see reports of mmc0
    tuning errors on VIM3 after a few hours uptime:
    
    [12483.917391] mmc0: tuning execution failed: -5
    [30535.551221] mmc0: tuning execution failed: -5
    [35359.953671] mmc0: tuning execution failed: -5
    [35561.875332] mmc0: tuning execution failed: -5
    [61733.348709] mmc0: tuning execution failed: -5
    
    I do not see the same on VIM3L, so remove sd-uhs-sdr50 from the common dtsi
    to silence the error, then (re)add it to the VIM3L dts.

    rings_size() sets sq_offset to the total size of the rings (the returned

    The memory leak problem was introduced as a side ef another fix in
    regulator_register() error path, I believe that the proper fix is
    to decouple device_register() function into its two compounds and
    initialize a struct device before assigning any values to its fields
    and then using it before actual registration of a device happens.
    
    This lets to call put_device() safely after initialization, and, since
    now a release callback is called, kfree(rdev->constraints) shall be
    removed to exclude a double free condition.

    recordmcount: only record relocation of type R_AARCH64_CALL26 on arm64.
    
    [ Upstream commit ea0eada45632f4807b2f49de951072283e2d781c ]
    
    Currently, if a section has a relocation to '_mcount' symbol, a new
    __mcount_loc entry will be added whatever the relocation type is.
    This is problematic when a relocation to '_mcount' is in the middle of a
    section and is not a call for ftrace use.
    
    Such relocation could be generated with below code for example:
        bool is_mcount(unsigned long addr)
        {
            return (target == (unsigned long) &_mcount);
        }
    
    With this snippet of code, ftrace will try to patch the mcount location
    generated by this code on module load and fail with:
    
        Call trace:
         ftrace_bug+0xa0/0x28c

    tpm: Require that all digests are present in TCG_PCR_EVENT2 structures
    
    [ Upstream commit 7f3d176f5f7e3f0477bf82df0f600fcddcdcc4e4 ]
    
    Require that the TCG_PCR_EVENT2.digests.count value strictly matches the
    value of TCG_EfiSpecIdEvent.numberOfAlgorithms in the event field of the
    TCG_PCClientPCREvent event log header. Also require that
    TCG_EfiSpecIdEvent.numberOfAlgorithms is non-zero.
    
    The TCG PC Client Platform Firmware Profile Specification section 9.1
    (Family "2.0", Level 00 Revision 1.04) states:
    
     For each Hash algorithm enumerated in the TCG_PCClientPCREvent entry,
     there SHALL be a corresponding digest in all TCG_PCR_EVENT2 structures.
     Note: This includes EV_NO_ACTION events which do not extend the PCR.
    
    Section 9.4.5.1 provides this description of
    TCG_EfiSpecIdEvent.numberOfAlgorithms:
    
     The number of Hash algorithms in the digestSizes field. This field MUST
     be set to a value of 0x01 or greater.
    
    Enforce these restrictions, as required by the above specification, in
    order to better identify and ignore invalid sequences of bytes at the
    end of an otherwise valid TPM2 event log. Firmware doesn't always have
    the means necessary to inform the kernel of the actual event log size so
    the kernel's event log parsing code should be stringent when parsing the
    event log for resiliency against firmware bugs. This is true, for
    example, when firmware passes the event log to the kernel via a reserved
    memory region described in device tree.
    
    POWER and some ARM systems use the "linux,sml-base" and "linux,sml-size"
    device tree properties to describe the memory region used to pass the
    event log from firmware to the kernel. Unfortunately, the
    "linux,sml-size" property describes the size of the entire reserved
    memory region rather than the size of the event long within the memory
    region and the event log format does not include information describing
    the size of the event log.
    
    tpm_read_log_of(), in drivers/char/tpm/eventlog/of.c, is where the
    "linux,sml-size" property is used. At the end of that function,
    log->bios_event_log_end is pointing at the end of the reserved memory
    region. That's typically 0x10000 bytes offset from "linux,sml-base",
    depending on what's defined in the device tree source.
    
    The firmware event log only fills a portion of those 0x10000 bytes and
    the rest of the memory region should be zeroed out by firmware. Even in
    the case of a properly zeroed bytes in the remainder of the memory
    region, the only thing allowing the kernel's event log parser to detect
    the end of the event log is the following conditional in
    __calc_tpm2_event_size():
    
            if (event_type == 0 && event_field->event_size == 0)
                    size = 0;
    
    If that wasn't there, __calc_tpm2_event_size() would think that a 16
    byte sequence of zeroes, following an otherwise valid event log, was
    a valid event.
    
    However, problems can occur if a single bit is set in the offset
    corresponding to either the TCG_PCR_EVENT2.eventType or
    TCG_PCR_EVENT2.eventSize fields, after the last valid event log entry.
    This could confuse the parser into thinking that an additional entry is
    present in the event log and exposing this invalid entry to userspace in
    the /sys/kernel/security/tpm0/binary_bios_measurements file. Such
    problems have been seen if firmware does not fully zero the memory
    region upon a warm reboot.
    
    This patch significantly raises the bar on how difficult it is for
    stale/invalid memory to confuse the kernel's event log parser but
    there's still, ultimately, a reliance on firmware to properly initialize
    the remainder of the memory region reserved for the event log as the
    parser cannot be expected to detect a stale but otherwise properly
    formatted firmware event log entry.

    [ Upstream commit 9ff416cf45a08f28167b75045222c762a0347930 ]
    
    Commit 1019fe2c7280 ("ARM: dts: exynos: Adjust bus related OPPs to the
    values correct for Exynos5422 Odroids") changed the parameters of the
    OPPs for the FSYS bus. Besides the frequency adjustments, it also removed
    the 'shared-opp' property from the OPP table used for FSYS_APB and FSYS
    busses.
    
    This revealed that in fact the FSYS bus frequency scaling never worked.
    When one OPP table is marked as 'opp-shared', only the first bus which
    selects the OPP sets the rate of its clock. Then OPP core assumes that
    the other busses have been changed to that OPP and no change to their
    clock rates are needed. Thus when FSYS_APB bus, which was registered
    first, set the rate for its clock, the OPP core did not change the FSYS
    bus clock later.
    
    The mentioned commit removed that behavior, what introduced a regression
    on some Odroid XU3 boards. Frequency scaling of the FSYS bus causes
    instability of the USB host operation, what can be observed as network
    hangs. To restore old behavior, simply disable frequency scaling for the
    FSYS bus.

    [ Upstream commit 931fc82a6aaf4e2e4a5490addaa6a090d78c24a7 ]
    
    When writing values to the IOP status/control register make sure those
    values do not have any extraneous bits that will clear interrupt flags.
    
    To place the SCC IOP into bypass mode would be desirable but this is not
    achieved by writing IOP_DMAINACTIVE | IOP_RUN | IOP_AUTOINC | IOP_BYPASS
    to the control register. Drop this ineffective register write.
    
    Remove the flawed and unused iop_bypass() function. Make use of the
    unused iop_stop() function.

    m68k: mac: Don't send IOP message until channel is idle
    
    [ Upstream commit aeb445bf2194d83e12e85bf5c65baaf1f093bd8f ]
    
    In the following sequence of calls, iop_do_send() gets called when the
    "send" channel is not in the IOP_MSG_IDLE state:
    
            iop_ism_irq()
                    iop_handle_send()
                            (msg->handler)()

                            iop_do_send()
    
    Avoid this by testing the channel state before calling iop_do_send().
    
    When sending, and iop_send_queue is empty, call iop_do_send() because
    the channel is idle. If iop_send_queue is not empty, iop_do_send() will
    get called later by iop_handle_send().

    clk: scmi: Fix min and max rate when registering clocks with discrete rates
    
    [ Upstream commit fcd2e0deae50bce48450f14c8fc5611b08d7438c ]
    
    Currently we are not initializing the scmi clock with discrete rates
    correctly. We fetch the min_rate and max_rate value only for clocks with
    ranges and ignore the ones with discrete rates. This will lead to wrong
    initialization of rate range when clock supports discrete rate.
    
    Fix this by using the first and the last rate in the sorted list of the
    discrete clock rates while registering the clock.

    sched/uclamp: Fix initialization of struct uclamp_rq
    
    [ Upstream commit d81ae8aac85ca2e307d273f6dc7863a721bf054e ]
    
    struct uclamp_rq was zeroed out entirely in assumption that in the first
    call to uclamp_rq_inc() they'd be initialized correctly in accordance to
    default settings.
    
    But when next patch introduces a static key to skip
    uclamp_rq_{inc,dec}() until userspace opts in to use uclamp, schedutil
    will fail to perform any frequency changes because the
    rq->uclamp[UCLAMP_MAX].value is zeroed at init and stays as such. Which
    means all rqs are capped to 0 by default.
    
    Fix it by making sure we do proper initialization at init without
    relying on uclamp_rq_inc() doing it later.

    [ Upstream commit 86be5c789690eb08656b08c072c50a7b02bf41f1 ]
    
    Some outputs from the RTL8723CS are connected to the PL port (BT_WAKE_AP),
    which runs at 1.8V. When BT_WAKE_AP is high, the PL pin this signal is
    connected to is overdriven, and the whole PL port's voltage rises
    somewhat. This results in changing voltage on the R_PWM pin (PL10),
    which is the cause for backlight flickering very noticeably when typing
    on a Bluetooth keyboard, because backlight intensity is highly sensitive
    to the voltage of the R_PWM pin.
    
    Limit the maximum WiFi/BT I/O voltage to 1.8V to avoid overdriving
    the PL port pins via BT and WiFi IO port signals. WiFi and BT
    functionality is unaffected by this change.
    
    This completely stops the backlight flicker when using bluetooth.

    CPUidle driver, which worked only on boards without secure firmware (like
    Peach-Pit/Pi Chromebooks). Apply the workaround only when board is

    blktrace: fix debugfs use after free
    
    [ Upstream commit bad8e64fb19d3a0de5e564d9a7271c31bd684369 ]
    
    On commit 6ac93117ab00 ("blktrace: use existing disk debugfs directory")
    merged on v4.12 Omar fixed the original blktrace code for request-based
    drivers (multiqueue). This however left in place a possible crash, if you
    happen to abuse blktrace while racing to remove / add a device.
    
    We used to use asynchronous removal of the request_queue, and with that
    the issue was easier to reproduce. Now that we have reverted to
    synchronous removal of the request_queue, the issue is still possible to
    reproduce, its however just a bit more difficult.
    
    We essentially run two instances of break-blktrace which add/remove
    a loop device, and setup a blktrace and just never tear the blktrace
    down. We do this twice in parallel. This is easily reproduced with the
    script run_0004.sh from break-blktrace [0].
    
    We can end up with two types of panics each reflecting where we
    race, one a failed blktrace setup:

    The common theme here is:
    
    debugfs: Directory 'loop0' with parent 'block' already present
    
    This crash happens because of how blktrace uses the debugfs directory
    where it places its files. Upon init we always create the same directory
    which would be needed by blktrace but we only do this for make_request
    drivers (multiqueue) block drivers. When you race a removal of these
    devices with a blktrace setup you end up in a situation where the
    make_request recursive debugfs removal will sweep away the blktrace
    files and then later blktrace will also try to remove individual
    dentries which are already NULL. The inverse is also possible and hence
    the two types of use after frees.
    
    We don't create the block debugfs directory on init for these types of
    block devices:
    
      * request-based block driver block devices
      * every possible partition
      * scsi-generic
    
    And so, this race should in theory only be possible with make_request
    drivers.
    
    We can fix the UAF by simply re-using the debugfs directory for
    make_request drivers (multiqueue) and only creating the ephemeral
    directory for the other type of block devices. The new clarifications
    on relying on the q->blk_trace_mutex *and* also checking for q->blk_trace
    *prior* to processing a blktrace ensures the debugfs directories are
    only created if no possible directory name clashes are possible.
    
    This goes tested with:
    
      o nvme partitions
      o ISCSI with tgt, and blktracing against scsi-generic with:
        o block
        o tape
        o cdrom
        o media changer
      o blktests
    
    This patch is part of the work which disputes the severity of
    CVE-2019-19770 which shows this issue is not a core debugfs issue, but
    a misuse of debugfs within blktace.

    arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Replace invalid bias-pull-none property
    
    [ Upstream commit 1b6a1a162defe649c5599d661b58ac64bb6f31b6 ]
    
    msm8916-pins.dtsi specifies "bias-pull-none" for most of the audio
    pin configurations. This was likely copied from the qcom kernel fork
    where the same property was used for these audio pins.
    
    However, "bias-pull-none" actually does not exist at all - not in
    mainline and not in downstream. I can only guess that the original
    intention was to configure "no pull", i.e. bias-disable.
    
    Change it to that instead.

    crc-t10dif: Fix potential crypto notify dead-lock
    
    [ Upstream commit 3906f640224dbe7714b52b66d7d68c0812808e19 ]
    
    The crypto notify call occurs with a read mutex held so you must
    not do any substantial work directly.  In particular, you cannot
    call crypto_alloc_* as they may trigger further notifications
    which may dead-lock in the presence of another writer.
    
    This patch fixes this by postponing the work into a work queue and
    taking the same lock in the module init function.
    
    While we're at it this patch also ensures that all RCU accesses are
    marked appropriately (tested with sparse).
    
    Finally this also reveals a race condition in module param show
    function as it may be called prior to the module init function.
    It's fixed by testing whether crct10dif_tfm is NULL (this is true
    iff the init function has not completed assuming fallback is false).

    EDAC: Fix reference count leaks
    
    [ Upstream commit 17ed808ad243192fb923e4e653c1338d3ba06207 ]
    
    When kobject_init_and_add() returns an error, it should be handled
    because kobject_init_and_add() takes a reference even when it fails. If
    this function returns an error, kobject_put() must be called to properly
    clean up the memory associated with the object.
    
    Therefore, replace calling kfree() and call kobject_put() and add a
    missing kobject_put() in the edac_device_register_sysfs_main_kobj()
    error path.

    arm64: dts: rockchip: fix rk3399-puma vcc5v0-host gpio
    
    [ Upstream commit 7a7184f6cfa9279f1a1c10a1845d247d7fad54ff ]
    
    The puma vcc5v0_host regulator node currently uses opposite active-values
    for the enable pin. The gpio-declaration uses active-high while the
    separate enable-active-low property marks the pin as active low.
    
    While on the kernel side this works ok, other DT users may get
    confused - as seen with uboot right now.
    
    So bring this in line and make both properties match, similar to the
    gmac fix.

    Move the update of nohz.next_balance for other idles cpus before balancing
    and updating the next_balance of local cfs_rq.
    
    Also, the nohz.next_balance is now updated only if all idle cpus got a
    chance to rebalance their domains and the idle balance has not been aborted
    because of new activities on the CPU. In case of need_resched, the idle
    load balance will be kick the next jiffie in order to address remaining

    HID: input: Fix devices that return multiple bytes in battery report
    
    commit 4f57cace81438cc873a96f9f13f08298815c9b51 upstream.
    
    Some devices, particularly the 3DConnexion Spacemouse wireless 3D
    controllers, return more than just the battery capacity in the battery
    report. The Spacemouse devices return an additional byte with a device
    specific field. However, hidinput_query_battery_capacity() only
    requests a 2 byte transfer.
    
    When a spacemouse is connected via USB (direct wire, no wireless dongle)
    and it returns a 3 byte report instead of the assumed 2 byte battery
    report the larger transfer confuses and frightens the USB subsystem
    which chooses to ignore the transfer. Then after 2 seconds assume the
    device has stopped responding and reset it. This can be reproduced
    easily by using a wired connection with a wireless spacemouse. The
    Spacemouse will enter a loop of resetting every 2 seconds which can be
    observed in dmesg.
    
    This patch solves the problem by increasing the transfer request to 4
    bytes instead of 2. The fix isn't particularly elegant, but it is simple
    and safe to backport to stable kernels. A further patch will follow to
    more elegantly handle battery reports that contain additional data.

    Provide a helper to run task_work instead of checking and running
    manually in a bunch of different spots. While doing so, also move the
    task run state setting where we run the task work. Then we can move it
    out of the callback helpers. This also helps ensure we only do this once
    per task_work list run, not per task_work item.

    Direct stderr to subprocess.STDOUT so error messages get included in the

    This is already being done in the make_allyesconfig method. Do the same
    for make_mrproper, make_olddefconfig, and make methods.
    
    With this, failures on unclean trees [1] will give users an error
    message that includes:
    "The source tree is not clean, please run 'make ARCH=um mrproper'"

    tracepoint: Mark __tracepoint_string's __used
    
    commit f3751ad0116fb6881f2c3c957d66a9327f69cefb upstream.
    
    __tracepoint_string's have their string data stored in .rodata, and an
    address to that data stored in the "__tracepoint_str" section. Functions
    that refer to those strings refer to the symbol of the address. Compiler
    optimization can replace those address references with references
    directly to the string data. If the address doesn't appear to have other
    uses, then it appears dead to the compiler and is removed. This can
    break the /tracing/printk_formats sysfs node which iterates the
    addresses stored in the "__tracepoint_str" section.
    
    Like other strings stored in custom sections in this header, mark these
    __used to inform the compiler that there are other non-obvious users of
    the address, so they should still be emitted.
