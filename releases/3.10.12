    mwifiex: do not create AP and P2P interfaces upon driver loading
    
    commit 1211c961170cedb21c30d5bb7e2033c8720b38db upstream.
    
    Bug 60747 - 1286:2044 [Microsoft Surface Pro]
        Marvell 88W8797 wifi show 3 interface under network
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60747
    
    This issue was also reported previously by OLPC and some folks from
    the community.
    
    There are 3 network interfaces with different types being created
    when mwifiex driver is loaded:
    
    1. mlan0 (infra. STA)
    2. uap0 (AP)
    3. p2p0 (P2P_CLIENT)
    
    The Network Manager attempts to use all 3 interfaces above without
    filtering the managed interface type. As the result, 3 identical
    interfaces are displayed under network manager. If user happens to
    click on an entry under which its interface is uap0 or p2p0, the
    association will fail.
    
    Work around it by removing the creation of AP and P2P interfaces
    at driver loading time. These interfaces can be added with 'iw' or
    other applications manually when they are needed.

    net: mvneta: properly disable HW PHY polling and ensure adjust_link() works
    
    [ Upstream commit 714086029116b6b0a34e67ba1dd2f0d1cf26770c ]
    
    This commit fixes a long-standing bug that has been reported by many
    users: on some Armada 370 platforms, only the network interface that
    has been used in U-Boot to tftp the kernel works properly in
    Linux. The other network interfaces can see a 'link up', but are
    unable to transmit data. The reports were generally made on the Armada
    370-based Mirabox, but have also been given on the Armada 370-RD
    board.
    
    The network MAC in the Armada 370/XP (supported by the mvneta driver
    in Linux) has a functionality that allows it to continuously poll the
    PHY and directly update the MAC configuration accordingly (speed,
    duplex, etc.). The very first versions of the driver submitted for
    review were using this hardware mechanism, but due to this, the driver
    was not integrated with the kernel phylib. Following reviews, the
    driver was changed to use the phylib, and therefore a software based
    polling. In software based polling, Linux regularly talks to the PHY
    over the MDIO bus, and sees if the link status has changed. If it's
    the case then the adjust_link() callback of the driver is called to
    update the MAC configuration accordingly.
    
    However, it turns out that the adjust_link() callback was not
    configuring the hardware in a completely correct way: while it was
    setting the speed and duplex bits correctly, it wasn't telling the
    hardware to actually take into account those bits rather than what the
    hardware-based PHY polling mechanism has concluded. So, in fact the
    adjust_link() callback was basically a no-op.
    
    However, the network happened to be working because on the network
    interfaces used by U-Boot for tftp on Armada 370 platforms because the
    hardware PHY polling was enabled by the bootloader, and left enabled
    by Linux. However, the second network interface not used for tftp (or
    both network interfaces if the kernel is loaded from USB, NAND or SD
    card) didn't had the hardware PHY polling enabled.
    
    This patch fixes this situation by:
    
     (1) Making sure that the hardware PHY polling is disabled by clearing
         the MVNETA_PHY_POLLING_ENABLE bit in the MVNETA_UNIT_CONTROL
         register in the driver ->probe() function.
    
     (2) Making sure that the duplex and speed selections made by the
         adjust_link() callback are taken into account by clearing the
         MVNETA_GMAC_AN_SPEED_EN and MVNETA_GMAC_AN_DUPLEX_EN bits in the
         MVNETA_GMAC_AUTONEG_CONFIG register.
    
    This patch has been tested on Armada 370 Mirabox, and now both network
    interfaces are usable after boot.

    net: ipv6: tcp: fix potential use after free in tcp_v6_do_rcv
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a1c756590633c0e86df606e5c618c190926a0df ]
    
    In tcp_v6_do_rcv() code, when processing pkt options, we soley work
    on our skb clone opt_skb that we've created earlier before entering
    tcp_rcv_established() on our way. However, only in condition ...
    
      if (np->rxopt.bits.rxtclass)
        np->rcv_tclass = ipv6_get_dsfield(ipv6_hdr(skb));
    
    ... we work on skb itself. As we extract every other information out
    of opt_skb in ipv6_pktoptions path, this seems wrong, since skb can
    already be released by tcp_rcv_established() earlier on. When we try
    to access it in ipv6_hdr(), we will dereference freed skb.

    ICMPv6: treat dest unreachable codes 5 and 6 as EACCES, not EPROTO
    
    [ Upstream commit 61e76b178dbe7145e8d6afa84bb4ccea71918994 ]
    
    RFC 4443 has defined two additional codes for ICMPv6 type 1 (destination
    unreachable) messages:
            5 - Source address failed ingress/egress policy
            6 - Reject route to destination
    
    Now they are treated as protocol error and icmpv6_err_convert() converts them
    to EPROTO.
    
    RFC 4443 says:
            "Codes 5 and 6 are more informative subsets of code 1."
    
    Treat codes 5 and 6 as code 1 (EACCES)
    
    Btw, connect() returning -EPROTO confuses firefox, so that fallback to
    other/IPv4 addresses does not work:

    [ Upstream commit 2d98c29b6fb3de44d9eaa73c09f9cf7209346383 ]
    
    While looking into MLDv1/v2 code, I noticed that bridging code does
    not convert it's max delay into jiffies for MLDv2 messages as we do
    in core IPv6' multicast code.
    
    RFC3810, 5.1.3. Maximum Response Code says:
    
      The Maximum Response Code field specifies the maximum time allowed
      before sending a responding Report. The actual time allowed, called
      the Maximum Response Delay, is represented in units of milliseconds,
      and is derived from the Maximum Response Code as follows: [...]
    
    As we update timers that work with jiffies, we need to convert it.

    are quite incompatible : Queue selection is disabled because skb
    dst was dropped before entering bonding device.
    
    This causes major performance regression, mainly because TCP packets
    for a given flow can be sent to multiple queues.
    
    This is particularly visible when using the new FQ packet scheduler

    tipc: set sk_err correctly when connection fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 2c8d85182348021fc0a1bed193a4be4161dc8364 ]
    
    Should a connect fail, if the publication/server is unavailable or
    due to some other error, a positive value will be returned and errno
    is never set. If the application code checks for an explicit zero
    return from connect (success) or a negative return (failure), it
    will not catch the error and subsequent send() calls will fail as
    shown from the strace snippet below.
    
    socket(0x1e /* PF_??? */, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0) = 3
    connect(3, {sa_family=0x1e /* AF_??? */, sa_data="\2\1\322\4\0\0\322\4\0\0\0\0\0\0"}, 16) = 111
    sendto(3, "test", 4, 0, NULL, 0)        = -1 EPIPE (Broken pipe)
    
    The reason for this behaviour is that TIPC wrongly inverts error
    codes set in sk_err.

    ipv6: Don't depend on per socket memory for neighbour discovery messages
    
    [ Upstream commit 25a6e6b84fba601eff7c28d30da8ad7cfbef0d43 ]
    
    Allocating skbs when sending out neighbour discovery messages
    currently uses sock_alloc_send_skb() based on a per net namespace
    socket and thus share a socket wmem buffer space.
    
    If a netdevice is temporarily unable to transmit due to carrier
    loss or for other reasons, the queued up ndisc messages will cosnume
    all of the wmem space and will thus prevent from any more skbs to
    be allocated even for netdevices that are able to transmit packets.
    
    The number of neighbour discovery messages sent is very limited,
    use of alloc_skb() bypasses the socket wmem buffer size enforcement
    while the manual call to skb_set_owner_w() maintains the socket
    reference needed for the IPv6 output path.
    
    This patch has orginally been posted by Eric Dumazet in a modified
    form.

    tcp: don't apply tsoffset if rcv_tsecr is zero
    
    [ Upstream commit e3e12028315749b7fa2edbc37328e5847be9ede9 ]
    
    The zero value means that tsecr is not valid, so it's a special case.
    
    tsoffset is used to customize tcp_time_stamp for one socket.
    tsoffset is usually zero, it's used when a socket was moved from one
    host to another host.
    
    Currently this issue affects logic of tcp_rcv_rtt_measure_ts. Due to
    incorrect value of rcv_tsecr, tcp_rcv_rtt_measure_ts sets rto to
    TCP_RTO_MAX.

    tcp: initialize rcv_tstamp for restored sockets

    u32 rcv_tstamp;     /* timestamp of last received ACK */
    
    Its value used in tcp_retransmit_timer, which closes socket
    if the last ack was received more then TCP_RTO_MAX ago.
    
    Currently rcv_tstamp is initialized to zero and if tcp_retransmit_timer
    is called before receiving a first ack, the connection is closed.
    
    This patch initializes rcv_tstamp to a timestamp, when a socket was

    [ Upstream commit 03803a59e32453ee5737c6096a295f748f03cc49 ]
    
    This patch adds another entry (HP hs2434 Mobile Broadband) to the list
    of exceptional devices that require a zero length packet in order to
    function properly. This list was added in commit 844e88f0. The hs2434
    is manufactured by Sierra Wireless, who also produces the MC7710,
    which the ZLP exception list was created for in the first place. So
    hopefully it is just this one producer's devices that will need this
    workaround.
    
    Tested on a DM1-4310NR HP notebook, which does not function without this
    change.

    net_sched: restore "linklayer atm" handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a8e3d84b1719a56f9151909e80ea6ebc5b8e318 ]
    
    commit 56b765b79 ("htb: improved accuracy at high rates")
    broke the "linklayer atm" handling.
    
     tc class add ... htb rate X ceil Y linklayer atm
    
    The linklayer setting is implemented by modifying the rate table
    which is send to the kernel.  No direct parameter were
    transferred to the kernel indicating the linklayer setting.
    
    The commit 56b765b79 ("htb: improved accuracy at high rates")
    removed the use of the rate table system.
    
    To keep compatible with older iproute2 utils, this patch detects
    the linklayer by parsing the rate table.  It also supports future
    versions of iproute2 to send this linklayer parameter to the
    kernel directly. This is done by using the __reserved field in
    struct tc_ratespec, to convey the choosen linklayer option, but
    only using the lower 4 bits of this field.
    
    Linklayer detection is limited to speeds below 100Mbit/s, because
    at high rates the rtab is gets too inaccurate, so bad that
    several fields contain the same values, this resembling the ATM
    detect.  Fields even start to contain "0" time to send, e.g. at
    1000Mbit/s sending a 96 bytes packet cost "0", thus the rtab have
    been more broken than we first realized.

    bridge: Use the correct bit length for bitmap functions in the VLAN code
    
    [ Upstream commit ef40b7ef181b7b1a24df2ef2d1ef84956bffa635 ]
    
    The VLAN code needs to know the length of the per-port VLAN bitmap to
    perform its most basic operations (retrieving VLAN informations, removing
    VLANs, forwarding database manipulation, etc). Unfortunately, in the
    current implementation we are using a macro that indicates the bitmap
    size in longs in places where the size in bits is expected, which in
    some cases can cause what appear to be random failures.
    Use the correct macro.

    When the repair mode is turned off, the write queue seqs are

    for example. If the "when" field isn't set, the retransmit timeout can
    be calculated incorrectly and a tcp connected can stop for two minutes
    (TCP_RTO_MAX).

    ipv6: remove max_addresses check from ipv6_create_tempaddr
    
    [ Upstream commit 4b08a8f1bd8cb4541c93ec170027b4d0782dab52 ]
    
    Because of the max_addresses check attackers were able to disable privacy
    extensions on an interface by creating enough autoconfigured addresses:
    
    <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q4/292>
    
    But the check is not actually needed: max_addresses protects the
    kernel to install too many ipv6 addresses on an interface and guards
    addrconf_prefix_rcv to install further addresses as soon as this limit
    is reached. We only generate temporary addresses in direct response of
    a new address showing up. As soon as we filled up the maximum number of
    addresses of an interface, we stop installing more addresses and thus
    also stop generating more temp addresses.
    
    Even if the attacker tries to generate a lot of temporary addresses
    by announcing a prefix and removing it again (lifetime == 0) we won't
    install more temp addresses, because the temporary addresses do count
    to the maximum number of addresses, thus we would stop installing new
    autoconfigured addresses when the limit is reached.
    
    This patch fixes CVE-2013-0343 (but other layer-2 attacks are still
    possible).

    rtnetlink: rtnl_bridge_getlink: Call nlmsg_find_attr() with ifinfomsg header
    
    [ Upstream commit 3e805ad288c524bb65aad3f1e004402223d3d504 ]
    
    Fix the iproute2 command `bridge vlan show`, after switching from
    rtgenmsg to ifinfomsg.
    
    Let's start with a little history:
    
    Feb 20:   Vlad Yasevich got his VLAN-aware bridge patchset included in
              the 3.9 merge window.
              In the kernel commit 6cbdceeb, he added attribute support to
              bridge GETLINK requests sent with rtgenmsg.
    
    Mar 6th:  Vlad got this iproute2 reference implementation of the bridge
              vlan netlink interface accepted (iproute2 9eff0e5c)
    
    Apr 25th: iproute2 switched from using rtgenmsg to ifinfomsg (63338dca)
              http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/239602/
              http://marc.info/?t=136680900700007
    
    Apr 28th: Linus released 3.9
    
    Apr 30th: Stephen released iproute2 3.9.0
    
    The `bridge vlan show` command haven't been working since the switch to
    ifinfomsg, or in a released version of iproute2. Since the kernel side
    only supports rtgenmsg, which iproute2 switched away from just prior to
    the iproute2 3.9.0 release.
    
    I haven't been able to find any documentation, about neither rtgenmsg
    nor ifinfomsg, and in which situation to use which, but kernel commit
    88c5b5ce seams to suggest that ifinfomsg should be used.
    
    Fixing this in kernel will break compatibility, but I doubt that anybody
    have been using it due to this bug in the user space reference
    implementation, at least not without noticing this bug. That said the
    functionality is still fully functional in 3.9, when reversing iproute2
    commit 63338dca.
    
    This could also be fixed in iproute2, but thats an ugly patch that would
    reintroduce rtgenmsg in iproute2, and from searching in netdev it seams
    like rtgenmsg usage is discouraged. I'm assuming that the only reason
    that Vlad implemented the kernel side to use rtgenmsg, was because
    iproute2 was using it at the time.

    [ Upstream commit 4221f40513233fa8edeef7fc82e44163fde03b9b ]
    
    Using inner-id for tunnel id is not safe in some rare cases.
    E.g. packets coming from multiple sources entering same tunnel
    can have same id. Therefore on tunnel packet receive we
    could have packets from two different stream but with same
    source and dst IP with same ip-id which could confuse ip packet
    reassembly.

    [ Upstream commit 33c6b1f6b154894321f5734e50c66621e9134e7e ]
    
    netlink dump operations take module as parameter to hold
    reference for entire netlink dump duration.
    Currently it holds ref only on genl module which is not correct

    For subsequent dump, only nlk->cb_lock was taken.
    Following patch fixes it by defining locked dumpit() and done()
    callback which takes care of genl-locking.

    ip_gre: fix ipgre_header to return correct offset MIME-Version: 1.0
    
    [ Upstream commit 77a482bdb2e68d13fae87541b341905ba70d572b ]
    
    Fix ipgre_header() (header_ops->create) to return the correct
    amount of bytes pushed. Most callers of dev_hard_header() seem
    to care only if it was success, but af_packet.c uses it as
    offset to the skb to copy from userspace only once. In practice
    this fixes packet socket sendto()/sendmsg() to gre tunnels.

    ipv6: don't stop backtracking in fib6_lookup_1 if subtree does not match
    
    [ Upstream commit 3e3be275851bc6fc90bfdcd732cd95563acd982b ]
    
    In case a subtree did not match we currently stop backtracking and return
    NULL (root table from fib_lookup). This could yield in invalid routing
    table lookups when using subtrees.
    
    Instead continue to backtrack until a valid subtree or node is found
    and return this match.
    
    Also remove unneeded NULL check.

    tcp: cubic: fix bug in bictcp_acked()
    
    [ Upstream commit cd6b423afd3c08b27e1fed52db828ade0addbc6b ]
    
    While investigating about strange increase of retransmit rates
    on hosts ~24 days after boot, Van found hystart was disabled
    if ca->epoch_start was 0, as following condition is true
    when tcp_time_stamp high order bit is set.
    
    (s32)(tcp_time_stamp - ca->epoch_start) < HZ
    
    Quoting Van :
    
     At initialization & after every loss ca->epoch_start is set to zero so
     I believe that the above line will turn off hystart as soon as the 2^31
     bit is set in tcp_time_stamp & hystart will stay off for 24 days.
     I think we've observed that cubic's restart is too aggressive without
     hystart so this might account for the higher drop rate we observe.

    tcp: cubic: fix overflow error in bictcp_update()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ed0edf9090bf4afa2c6fc4f38575a85a80d4b20 ]
    
    commit 17a6e9f1aa9 ("tcp_cubic: fix clock dependency") added an
    overflow error in bictcp_update() in following code :
    
    /* change the unit from HZ to bictcp_HZ */
    t = ((tcp_time_stamp + msecs_to_jiffies(ca->delay_min>>3) -
          ca->epoch_start) << BICTCP_HZ) / HZ;
    
    Because msecs_to_jiffies() being unsigned long, compiler does
    implicit type promotion.
    
    We really want to constrain (tcp_time_stamp - ca->epoch_start)
    to a signed 32bit value, or else 't' has unexpected high values.
    
    This bugs triggers an increase of retransmit rates ~24 days after
    boot [1], as the high order bit of tcp_time_stamp flips.
    
    [1] for hosts with HZ=1000

    bridge: don't try to update timers in case of broken MLD queries
    
    [ Upstream commit 248ba8ec05a2c3b118c2224e57eb10c128176ab1 ]
    
    Currently we are reading an uninitialized value for the max_delay
    variable when snooping an MLD query message of invalid length and would
    update our timers with that.
    
    Fixing this by simply ignoring such broken MLD queries (just like we do
    for IGMP already).
    
    This is a regression introduced by:

    net: check net.core.somaxconn sysctl values
    
    [ Upstream commit 5f671d6b4ec3e6d66c2a868738af2cdea09e7509 ]
    
    It's possible to assign an invalid value to the net.core.somaxconn
    sysctl variable, because there is no checks at all.
    
    The sk_max_ack_backlog field of the sock structure is defined as
    unsigned short. Therefore, the backlog argument in inet_listen()
    shouldn't exceed USHRT_MAX. The backlog argument in the listen() syscall
    is truncated to the somaxconn value. So, the somaxconn value shouldn't
    exceed 65535 (USHRT_MAX).
    Also, negative values of somaxconn are meaningless.
    
    before:
    $ sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=256
    net.core.somaxconn = 256
    $ sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=65536
    net.core.somaxconn = 65536
    $ sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=-100
    net.core.somaxconn = -100
    
    after:
    $ sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=256
    net.core.somaxconn = 256
    $ sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=65536
    error: "Invalid argument" setting key "net.core.somaxconn"
    $ sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=-100
    error: "Invalid argument" setting key "net.core.somaxconn"

    htb: fix sign extension bug
    
    [ Upstream commit cbd375567f7e4811b1c721f75ec519828ac6583f ]
    
    When userspace passes a large priority value
    the assignment of the unsigned value hopt->prio
    to  signed int cl->prio causes cl->prio to become negative and the
    comparison is with TC_HTB_NUMPRIO is always false.
    
    The result is that HTB crashes by referencing outside
    the array when processing packets. With this patch the large value
    wraps around like other values outside the normal range.
