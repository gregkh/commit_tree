    hfsplus: Fix kfree of wrong pointers in hfsplus_fill_super() error path
    
    commit f588c960fcaa6fa8bf82930bb819c9aca4eb9347 upstream.
    
    Commit 6596528e391a ("hfsplus: ensure bio requests are not smaller than
    the hardware sectors") changed the pointers used for volume header
    allocations but failed to free the correct pointers in the error path
    path of hfsplus_fill_super() and hfsplus_read_wrapper.
    
    The second hunk came from a separate patch by Pavel Ivanov.

    commit 051a8cb6550d917225ead1cd008b5966350f6d53 upstream.
    
    The previous fix for the position-buffer check gives yet another
    regression on a Dell laptop.  The safest fix right now is to add a
    static quirk for this device (and better to apply it for stable
    kernels too).

    commit ca201c096269ee2d40037fea96a59fd0695888c4 upstream.
    
    This is patch for Conexant codec of Intel HDA driver, adding new quirk
    for Lenovo Thinkpad T520 and W520. Conexant autodetection works fine for
    T520 (similar subsystem ID is used also in W520 model) and detects more
    mixer features compared to generic (fallback) Lenovo quirk with
    hardcoded options in Conexant codec.
    
    Patch was activelly tested with Linux 3.0.4, 3.0.6 and 3.0.7 without any
    problems.

    crypto: ghash - Avoid null pointer dereference if no key is set
    
    commit 7ed47b7d142ec99ad6880bbbec51e9f12b3af74c upstream.
    
    The ghash_update function passes a pointer to gf128mul_4k_lle which will
    be NULL if ghash_setkey is not called or if the most recent call to
    ghash_setkey failed to allocate memory.  This causes an oops.  Fix this
    up by returning an error code in the null case.
    
    This is trivially triggered from unprivileged userspace through the
    AF_ALG interface by simply writing to the socket without setting a key.
    
    The ghash_final function has a similar issue, but triggering it requires
    a memory allocation failure in ghash_setkey _after_ at least one
    successful call to ghash_update.

    mm: fix race between mremap and removing migration entry
    
    commit 486cf46f3f9be5f2a966016c1a8fe01e32cde09e upstream.
    
    I don't usually pay much attention to the stale "? " addresses in
    stack backtraces, but this lucky report from Pawel Sikora hints that
    mremap's move_ptes() has inadequate locking against page migration.
    
     3.0 BUG_ON(!PageLocked(p)) in migration_entry_to_page():
     kernel BUG at include/linux/swapops.h:105!
     RIP: 0010:[<ffffffff81127b76>]  [<ffffffff81127b76>]
                           migration_entry_wait+0x156/0x160
      [<ffffffff811016a1>] handle_pte_fault+0xae1/0xaf0

      [<ffffffff81421d5f>] page_fault+0x1f/0x30
    
    mremap's down_write of mmap_sem, together with i_mmap_mutex or lock,
    and pagetable locks, were good enough before page migration (with its
    requirement that every migration entry be found) came in, and enough
    while migration always held mmap_sem; but not enough nowadays, when
    there's memory hotremove and compaction.
    
    The danger is that move_ptes() lets a migration entry dodge around
    behind remove_migration_pte()'s back, so it's in the old location when
    looking at the new, then in the new location when looking at the old.
    
    Either mremap's move_ptes() must additionally take anon_vma lock(), or
    migration's remove_migration_pte() must stop peeking for is_swap_entry()
    before it takes pagetable lock.
    
    Consensus chooses the latter: we prefer to add overhead to migration
    than to mremapping, which gets used by JVMs and by exec stack setup.

    Commit 4b239f458 ("x86-64, mm: Put early page table high") causes a S4
    regression since 2.6.39, namely the machine reboots occasionally at S4
    resume.  It doesn't happen always, overall rate is about 1/20.  But,
    like other bugs, once when this happens, it continues to happen.

    firewire: sbp2: fix panic after rmmod with slow targets
    
    commit 0278ccd9d53e07c4e699432b2fed9de6c56f506c upstream.
    
    If firewire-sbp2 starts a login to a target that doesn't complete ORBs
    in a timely manner (and has to retry the login), and the module is
    removed before the operation times out, you end up with a null-pointer
    dereference and a kernel panic.
    
    [SR:  This happens because sbp2_target_get/put() do not maintain
    module references.  scsi_device_get/put() do, but at occasions like
    Chris describes one, nobody holds a reference to an SBP-2 sdev.]
    
    This patch cancels pending work for each unit in sbp2_remove(), which
    hopefully means there are no extra references around that prevent us
    from unloading. This fixes my crash.

    xfs: revert to using a kthread for AIL pushing
    
    commit 0030807c66f058230bcb20d2573bcaf28852e804 upstream
    
    Currently we have a few issues with the way the workqueue code is used to
    implement AIL pushing:
    
     - it accidentally uses the same workqueue as the syncer action, and thus
       can be prevented from running if there are enough sync actions active
       in the system.
     - it doesn't use the HIGHPRI flag to queue at the head of the queue of
       work items
    
    At this point I'm not confident enough in getting all the workqueue flags and
    tweaks right to provide a perfectly reliable execution context for AIL
    pushing, which is the most important piece in XFS to make forward progress
    when the log fills.
    
    Revert back to use a kthread per filesystem which fixes all the above issues
    at the cost of having a task struct and stack around for each mounted
    filesystem.  In addition this also gives us much better ways to diagnose
    any issues involving hung AIL pushing and removes a small amount of code.

    items flush into the same buffers that may be pinned directly due operations
    on the unlinked inode list operating directly on buffers.  To do this add a
    return value to .iop_pushbuf that tells the AIL push about this and use

    If an item was locked we should not update xa_last_pushed_lsn and thus skip
    it when restarting the AIL scan as we need to be able to lock and write it
    out as soon as possible.  Otherwise heavy lock contention might starve AIL
    pushing too easily, especially given the larger backoff once we moved
    xa_last_pushed_lsn all the way to the target lsn.

    xfs: use a cursor for bulk AIL insertion
    
    commit 1d8c95a363bf8cd4d4182dd19c01693b635311c2 upstream
    
    
    xfs: use a cursor for bulk AIL insertion
    
    Delayed logging can insert tens of thousands of log items into the
    AIL at the same LSN. When the committing of log commit records
    occur, we can get insertions occurring at an LSN that is not at the
    end of the AIL. If there are thousands of items in the AIL on the
    tail LSN, each insertion has to walk the AIL to find the correct
    place to insert the new item into the AIL. This can consume large
    amounts of CPU time and block other operations from occurring while
    the traversals are in progress.
    
    To avoid this repeated walk, use a AIL cursor to record
    where we should be inserting the new items into the AIL without
    having to repeat the walk. The cursor infrastructure already
    provides this functionality for push walks, so is a simple extension
    of existing code. While this will not avoid the initial walk, it
    will avoid repeating it tens of thousands of times during a single
    checkpoint commit.
    
    This version includes logic improvements from Christoph Hellwig.

    commit 2bcf6e970f5a88fa05dced5eeb0326e13d93c4a1 upstream
    
    Start the periodic sync workers only after we have finished xfs_mountfs
    and thus fully set up the filesystem structures.  Without this we can
    call into xfs_qm_sync before the quotainfo strucute is set up if the
    mount takes unusually long, and probably hit other incomplete states
    as well.
    
    Also clean up the xfs_fs_fill_super error path by using consistent
    label names, and removing an impossible to reach case.

    commit eac2095398668f989a3dd8d00be1b87850d78c01 upstream.
    
    Nouveau makes the assumption that if a TTM is bound there will be a mm_node

    commit 8d3bb23609d4ae22803a15d232289fc09a7b61c4 upstream.
    
    This was true for new TTM_PL_SYSTEM and new TTM_PL_TT cases, but wasn't
    the case on TTM_PL_SYSTEM<->TTM_PL_TT moves, which causes trouble on some

    HID: magicmouse: ignore 'ivalid report id' while switching modes, v2
    
    commit 35d851df23b093ee027f827fed2213ae5e88fc7a upstream.
    
    This is basically a more generic respin of 23746a6 ("HID: magicmouse: ignore
    'ivalid report id' while switching modes") which got reverted later by
    c3a492.
    
    It turns out that on some configurations, this is actually still the case
    and we are not able to detect in runtime.
    
    The device reponds with 'invalid report id' when feature report switching it
    into multitouch mode is sent to it.
    
    This has been silently ignored before 0825411ade ("HID: bt: Wait for ACK
    on Sent Reports"), but since this commit, it propagates -EIO from the _raw
    callback .
    
    So let the driver ignore -EIO as response to 0xd7,0x01 report, as that's
    how the device reacts in normal mode.
    
    Sad, but following reality.
    
    This fixes https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35022

    cputimer: Cure lock inversion
    
    commit bcd5cff7216f9b2de0a148cc355eac199dc6f1cf upstream.
    
    There's a lock inversion between the cputimer->lock and rq->lock;
    notably the two callchains involved are:
    
     update_rlimit_cpu()
       sighand->siglock
       set_process_cpu_timer()
         cpu_timer_sample_group()
           thread_group_cputimer()
             cputimer->lock
             thread_group_cputime()
               task_sched_runtime()
                 ->pi_lock
                 rq->lock
    
     scheduler_tick()
       rq->lock
       task_tick_fair()
         update_curr()
           account_group_exec()
             cputimer->lock
    
    Where the first one is enabling a CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID timer, and
    the second one is keeping up-to-date.
    
    This problem was introduced by e8abccb7193 ("posix-cpu-timers: Cure
    SMP accounting oddities").
    
    Cure the problem by removing the cputimer->lock and rq->lock nesting,
    this leaves concurrent enablers doing duplicate work, but the time
    wasted should be on the same order otherwise wasted spinning on the
    lock and the greater-than assignment filter should ensure we preserve
    monotonicity.

    commit 5a6e8482a16e61250a9121fc9ec719ab0529e760 upstream.
    
    FB scratch indices are dword indices, but we were treating
    them as byte indices.  As such, we were getting the wrong
    FB scratch data for non-0 indices.  Fix the indices and
    guard the indexing against indices larger than the scratch
    allocation.
    
    Fixes memory corruption on some boards if data was written
    past the end of the FB scratch array.

    Avoid using variable-length arrays in kernel/sys.c
    
    commit a84a79e4d369a73c0130b5858199e949432da4c6 upstream.
    
    The size is always valid, but variable-length arrays generate worse code
    for no good reason (unless the function happens to be inlined and the
    compiler sees the length for the simple constant it is).
    
    Also, there seems to be some code generation problem on POWER, where
    Henrik Bakken reports that register r28 can get corrupted under some
    subtle circumstances (interrupt happening at the wrong time?).  That all
    indicates some seriously broken compiler issues, but since variable
    length arrays are bad regardless, there's little point in trying to
    chase it down.
    
    "Just don't do that, then".

    hwmon: (w83627ehf) Properly report thermal diode sensors
    
    commit bf164c58e58328c40ebc597a8ac00cc6840f9703 upstream.
    
    The w83627ehf driver is improperly reporting thermal diode sensors as
    type 2, instead of 3. This caused "sensors" and possibly other
    monitoring tools to report these sensors as "transistor" instead of
    "thermal diode".
    
    Furthermore, diode subtype selection (CPU vs. external) is only
    supported by the original W83627EHF/EHG. All later models only support
    CPU diode type, and some (NCT6776F) don't even have the register in
    question so we should avoid reading from it.

    HID: usbhid: Add support for SiGma Micro chip
    
    commit f5e4282586dc0c9dab8c7d32e6c43aa07f68586b upstream.
    
    Patch to add SiGma Micro-based keyboards (1c4f:0002) to hid-quirks.
    
    These keyboards dont seem to allow the records to be initialized, and hence a
    timeout occurs when the usbhid driver attempts to initialize them. The patch
    just adds the signature for these keyboards to the hid-quirks list with the
    setting HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS. This removes the 5-10 second wait for the
    timeout to occur.
