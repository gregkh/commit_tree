    mm, page_alloc: do not break __GFP_THISNODE by zonelist reset
    
    commit 7810e6781e0fcbca78b91cf65053f895bf59e85f upstream.
    
    In __alloc_pages_slowpath() we reset zonelist and preferred_zoneref for
    allocations that can ignore memory policies.  The zonelist is obtained
    from current CPU's node.  This is a problem for __GFP_THISNODE
    allocations that want to allocate on a different node, e.g.  because the
    allocating thread has been migrated to a different CPU.
    
    This has been observed to break SLAB in our 4.4-based kernel, because
    there it relies on __GFP_THISNODE working as intended.  If a slab page
    is put on wrong node's list, then further list manipulations may corrupt
    the list because page_to_nid() is used to determine which node's
    list_lock should be locked and thus we may take a wrong lock and race.
    
    Current SLAB implementation seems to be immune by luck thanks to commit
    511e3a058812 ("mm/slab: make cache_grow() handle the page allocated on
    arbitrary node") but there may be others assuming that __GFP_THISNODE
    works as promised.
    
    We can fix it by simply removing the zonelist reset completely.  There
    is actually no reason to reset it, because memory policies and cpusets
    don't affect the zonelist choice in the first place.  This was different
    when commit 183f6371aac2 ("mm: ignore mempolicies when using
    ALLOC_NO_WATERMARK") introduced the code, as mempolicies provided their
    own restricted zonelists.
    
    We might consider this for 4.17 although I don't know if there's
    anything currently broken.
    
    SLAB is currently not affected, but in kernels older than 4.7 that don't
    yet have 511e3a058812 ("mm/slab: make cache_grow() handle the page
    allocated on arbitrary node") it is.  That's at least 4.4 LTS.  Older
    ones I'll have to check.
    
    So stable backports should be more important, but will have to be
    reviewed carefully, as the code went through many changes.  BTW I think
    that also the ac->preferred_zoneref reset is currently useless if we
    don't also reset ac->nodemask from a mempolicy to NULL first (which we
    probably should for the OOM victims etc?), but I would leave that for a
    separate patch.

    fs/binfmt_misc.c: do not allow offset overflow
    
    commit 5cc41e099504b77014358b58567c5ea6293dd220 upstream.
    
    WHen registering a new binfmt_misc handler, it is possible to overflow
    the offset to get a negative value, which might crash the system, or
    possibly leak kernel data.
    
    Here is a crash log when 2500000000 was used as an offset:

    vhost: fix info leak due to uninitialized memory
    
    commit 670ae9caaca467ea1bfd325cb2a5c98ba87f94ad upstream.
    
    struct vhost_msg within struct vhost_msg_node is copied to userspace.
    Unfortunately it turns out on 64 bit systems vhost_msg has padding after
    type which gcc doesn't initialize, leaking 4 uninitialized bytes to
    userspace.
    
    This padding also unfortunately means 32 bit users of this interface are
    broken on a 64 bit kernel which will need to be fixed separately.

    HID: wacom: Correct logical maximum Y for 2nd-gen Intuos Pro large
    
    commit d471b6b22d37bf9928c6d0202bdaaf76583b8b61 upstream.
    
    The HID descriptor for the 2nd-gen Intuos Pro large (PTH-860) contains
    a typo which defines an incorrect logical maximum Y value. This causes
    a small portion of the bottom of the tablet to become unusable (both
    because the area is below the "bottom" of the tablet and because
    'wacom_wac_event' ignores out-of-range values). It also results in a
    skewed aspect ratio.
    
    To fix this, we add a quirk to 'wacom_usage_mapping' which overwrites
    the data with the correct value.

    HID: intel_ish-hid: ipc: register more pm callbacks to support hibernation
    
    commit ebeaa367548e9e92dd9374b9464ff6e7d157117b upstream.
    
    Current ISH driver only registers suspend/resume PM callbacks which don't
    support hibernation (suspend to disk). Basically after hiberation, the ISH
    can't resume properly and user may not see sensor events (for example: screen
                    rotation may not work).
    
    User will not see a crash or panic or anything except the following message
    in log:
    
            hid-sensor-hub 001F:8086:22D8.0001: timeout waiting for response from ISHTP device
    
    So this patch adds support for S4/hiberbation to ISH by using the
    SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS() MACRO instead of struct dev_pm_ops directly. The suspend
    and resume functions will now be used for both suspend to RAM and hibernation.
    
    If power management is disabled, SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS will do nothing, the suspend
    and resume related functions won't be used, so mark them as __maybe_unused to
    clarify that this is the intended behavior, and remove #ifdefs for power
    management.

    orangefs: set i_size on new symlink
    
    commit f6a4b4c9d07dda90c7c29dae96d6119ac6425dca upstream.
    
    As long as a symlink inode remains in-core, the destination (and
    therefore size) will not be re-fetched from the server, as it cannot
    change.  The original implementation of the attribute cache assumed that
    setting the expiry time in the past was sufficient to cause a re-fetch
    of all attributes on the next getattr.  That does not work in this case.
    
    The bug manifested itself as follows.  When the command sequence
    
    touch foo; ln -s foo bar; ls -l bar
    
    is run, the output was
    
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 fedora fedora 4906 Apr 24 19:10 bar -> foo
    
    However, after a re-mount, ls -l bar produces
    
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 fedora fedora    3 Apr 24 19:10 bar -> foo
    
    After this commit, even before a re-mount, the output is
    
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 fedora fedora    3 Apr 24 19:10 bar -> foo

    genirq/affinity: Defer affinity setting if irq chip is busy
    
    commit 12f47073a40f6aa75119d8f5df4077b7f334cced upstream.
    
    The case that interrupt affinity setting fails with -EBUSY can be handled
    in the kernel completely by using the already available generic pending
    infrastructure.
    
    If a irq_chip::set_affinity() fails with -EBUSY, handle it like the
    interrupts for which irq_chip::set_affinity() can only be invoked from
    interrupt context. Copy the new affinity mask to irq_desc::pending_mask and
    set the affinity pending bit. The next raised interrupt for the affected
    irq will check the pending bit and try to set the new affinity from the
    handler. This avoids that -EBUSY is returned when an affinity change is
    requested from user space and the previous change has not been cleaned
    up. The new affinity will take effect when the next interrupt is raised
    from the device.

    genirq/generic_pending: Do not lose pending affinity update
    
    commit a33a5d2d16cb84bea8d5f5510f3a41aa48b5c467 upstream.
    
    The generic pending interrupt mechanism moves interrupts from the interrupt
    handler on the original target CPU to the new destination CPU. This is
    required for x86 and ia64 due to the way the interrupt delivery and
    acknowledge works if the interrupts are not remapped.
    
    However that update can fail for various reasons. Some of them are valid
    reasons to discard the pending update, but the case, when the previous move
    has not been fully cleaned up is not a legit reason to fail.
    
    Check the return value of irq_do_set_affinity() for -EBUSY, which indicates
    a pending cleanup, and rearm the pending move in the irq dexcriptor so it's
    tried again when the next interrupt arrives.

    commit 839b0f1c4ef674cd929a42304c078afca278581a upstream.
    
    To address the EBUSY fail of interrupt affinity settings in case that the
    previous setting has not been cleaned up yet, use the new apic_ack_irq()
    function instead of the special uv_ack_apic() implementation which is
    merily a wrapper around ack_APIC_irq().
    
    Preparatory change for the real fix

    x86/apic: Provide apic_ack_irq()
    
    commit c0255770ccdc77ef2184d2a0a2e0cde09d2b44a4 upstream.
    
    apic_ack_edge() is explicitely for handling interrupt affinity cleanup when
    interrupt remapping is not available or disable.
    
    Remapped interrupts and also some of the platform specific special
    interrupts, e.g. UV, invoke ack_APIC_irq() directly.
    
    To address the issue of failing an affinity update with -EBUSY the delayed
    affinity mechanism can be reused, but ack_APIC_irq() does not handle
    that. Adding this to ack_APIC_irq() is not possible, because that function
    is also used for exceptions and directly handled interrupts like IPIs.
    
    Create a new function, which just contains the conditional invocation of
    irq_move_irq() and the final ack_APIC_irq().
    
    Reuse the new function in apic_ack_edge().
    
    Preparatory change for the real fix.

    x86/apic/vector: Prevent hlist corruption and leaks
    
    commit 80ae7b1a918e78b0bae88b0c0ad413d3fdced968 upstream.
    
    Several people observed the WARN_ON() in irq_matrix_free() which triggers
    when the caller tries to free an vector which is not in the allocation
    range. Song provided the trace information which allowed to decode the root
    cause.
    
    The rework of the vector allocation mechanism failed to preserve a sanity
    check, which prevents setting a new target vector/CPU when the previous
    affinity change has not fully completed.
    
    As a result a half finished affinity change can be overwritten, which can
    cause the leak of a irq descriptor pointer on the previous target CPU and
    double enqueue of the hlist head into the cleanup lists of two or more
    CPUs. After one CPU cleaned up its vector the next CPU will invoke the
    cleanup handler with vector 0, which triggers the out of range warning in
    the matrix allocator.
    
    Prevent this by checking the apic_data of the interrupt whether the
    move_in_progress flag is false and the hlist node is not hashed. Return
    -EBUSY if not.
    
    This prevents the damage and restores the behaviour before the vector
    allocation rework, but due to other changes in that area it also widens the
    chance that user space can observe -EBUSY. In theory this should be fine,
    but actually not all user space tools handle -EBUSY correctly. Addressing
    that is not part of this fix, but will be addressed in follow up patches.

    nvme/pci: Sync controller reset for AER slot_reset
    
    commit cc1d5e749a2e1cf59fa940b976181e631d6985e1 upstream.
    
    AER handling expects a successful return from slot_reset means the
    driver made the device functional again. The nvme driver had been using
    an asynchronous reset to recover the device, so the device
    may still be initializing after control is returned to the
    AER handler. This creates problems for subsequent event handling,
    causing the initializion to fail.
    
    This patch fixes that by syncing the controller reset before returning
    to the AER driver, and reporting the true state of the reset.

    libata: Drop SanDisk SD7UB3Q*G1001 NOLPM quirk
    
    commit 2cfce3a86b64b53f0a70e92a6a659c720c319b45 upstream.
    
    Commit 184add2ca23c ("libata: Apply NOLPM quirk for SanDisk
    SD7UB3Q*G1001 SSDs") disabled LPM for SanDisk SD7UB3Q*G1001 SSDs.
    
    This has lead to several reports of users of that SSD where LPM
    was working fine and who know have a significantly increased idle
    power consumption on their laptops.
    
    Likely there is another problem on the T450s from the original
    reporter which gets exposed by the uncore reaching deeper sleep
    states (higher PC-states) due to LPM being enabled. The problem as
    reported, a hardfreeze about once a day, already did not sound like
    it would be caused by LPM and the reports of the SSD working fine
    confirm this. The original reporter is ok with dropping the quirk.
    
    A X250 user has reported the same hard freeze problem and for him
    the problem went away after unrelated updates, I suspect some GPU
    driver stack changes fixed things.
    
    TL;DR: The original reporters problem were triggered by LPM but not
    an LPM issue, so drop the quirk for the SSD in question.

    cpufreq: governors: Fix long idle detection logic in load calculation
    
    commit 7592019634f8473f0b0973ce79297183077bdbc2 upstream.
    
    According to current code implementation, detecting the long
    idle period is done by checking if the interval between two
    adjacent utilization update handlers is long enough. Although
    this mechanism can detect if the idle period is long enough
    (no utilization hooks invoked during idle period), it might
    not cover a corner case: if the task has occupied the CPU
    for too long which causes no context switches during that
    period, then no utilization handler will be launched until this
    high prio task is scheduled out. As a result, the idle_periods
    field might be calculated incorrectly because it regards the
    100% load as 0% and makes the conservative governor who uses
    this field confusing.
    
    Change the detection to compare the idle_time with sampling_rate
    directly.

    cpufreq: Fix new policy initialization during limits updates via sysfs
    
    commit c7d1f119c48f64bebf0fa1e326af577c6152fe30 upstream.
    
    If the policy limits are updated via cpufreq_update_policy() and
    subsequently via sysfs, the limits stored in user_policy may be
    set incorrectly.
    
    For example, if both min and max are set via sysfs to the maximum
    available frequency, user_policy.min and user_policy.max will also
    be the maximum.  If a policy notifier triggered by
    cpufreq_update_policy() lowers both the min and the max at this
    point, that change is not reflected by the user_policy limits, so
    if the max is updated again via sysfs to the same lower value,
    then user_policy.max will be lower than user_policy.min which
    shouldn't happen.  In particular, if one of the policy CPUs is
    then taken offline and back online, cpufreq_set_policy() will
    fail for it due to a failing limits check.
    
    To prevent that from happening, initialize the min and max fields
    of the new_policy object to the ones stored in user_policy that
    were previously set via sysfs.

    bdi: Move cgroup bdi_writeback to a dedicated low concurrency workqueue
    
    commit f183464684190bacbfb14623bd3e4e51b7575b4c upstream.
    
    From 0aa2e9b921d6db71150633ff290199554f0842a8 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001

    cgwb_release() punts the actual release to cgwb_release_workfn() on
    system_wq.  Depending on the number of cgroups or block devices, there
    can be a lot of cgwb_release_workfn() in flight at the same time.
    
    We're periodically seeing close to 256 kworkers getting stuck with the
    following stack trace and overtime the entire system gets stuck.
    
      [<ffffffff810ee40c>] _synchronize_rcu_expedited.constprop.72+0x2fc/0x330
      [<ffffffff810ee634>] synchronize_rcu_expedited+0x24/0x30

      [<ffffffff81969019>] ret_from_fork+0x29/0x40
      [<ffffffffffffffff>] 0xffffffffffffffff
    
    The events leading to the lockup are...
    
    1. A lot of cgwb_release_workfn() is queued at the same time and all
       system_wq kworkers are assigned to execute them.
    
    2. They all end up calling synchronize_rcu_expedited().  One of them
       wins and tries to perform the expedited synchronization.
    
    3. However, that invovles queueing rcu_exp_work to system_wq and
       waiting for it.  Because #1 is holding all available kworkers on
       system_wq, rcu_exp_work can't be executed.  cgwb_release_workfn()
       is waiting for synchronize_rcu_expedited() which in turn is waiting
       for cgwb_release_workfn() to free up some of the kworkers.
    
    We shouldn't be scheduling hundreds of cgwb_release_workfn() at the
    same time.  There's nothing to be gained from that.  This patch
    updates cgwb release path to use a dedicated percpu workqueue with
    @max_active of 1.
    
    While this resolves the problem at hand, it might be a good idea to
    isolate rcu_exp_work to its own workqueue too as it can be used from
    various paths and is prone to this sort of indirect A-A deadlocks.

    What happened is the following:
    
    1. There are several MQ queues with shared tags.
    2. One queue is about to be freed and now task is in
       blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set().
    3. Other CPU is in blk_mq_sched_restart() and loops over all queues in
       tag list in order to find hctx to restart.
    
    Because linked list entry was modified in blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set()
    without proper waiting for a grace period, blk_mq_sched_restart()
    never ends, spining in list_for_each_entry_rcu_rr(), thus soft lockup.
    
    Fix is simple: reinit list entry after an RCU grace period elapsed.

    x86/MCE: Fix stack out-of-bounds write in mce-inject.c: Flags_read()
    
    commit 985c78d3ff8e9c74450fa2bb08eb55e680d999ca upstream.
    
    Each of the strings that we want to put into the buf[MAX_FLAG_OPT_SIZE]
    in flags_read() is two characters long. But the sprintf() adds
    a trailing newline and will add a terminating NUL byte. So
    MAX_FLAG_OPT_SIZE needs to be 4.
    
    sprintf() calls vsnprintf() and *that* does return:
    
    " * The return value is the number of characters which would
     * be generated for the given input, excluding the trailing
     * '\0', as per ISO C99."

    ALSA: hda - Handle kzalloc() failure in snd_hda_attach_pcm_stream()
    
    commit a3aa60d511746bd6c0d0366d4eb90a7998bcde8b upstream.
    
    When 'kzalloc()' fails in 'snd_hda_attach_pcm_stream()', a new pcm instance is
    created without setting its operators via 'snd_pcm_set_ops()'. Following
    operations on the new pcm instance can trigger kernel null pointer dereferences
    and cause kernel oops.
    
    This bug was found with my work on building a gray-box fault-injection tool for
    linux-kernel-module binaries. A kernel null pointer dereference was confirmed
    from line 'substream->ops->open()' in function 'snd_pcm_open_substream()' in
    file 'sound/core/pcm_native.c'.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by calling 'snd_device_free()' in the error handling
    path of 'kzalloc()', which removes the new pcm instance from the snd card before
    returns with an error code.

    ID got broken by this change, spewing an error like:

    btrfs: scrub: Don't use inode pages for device replace
    
    commit ac0b4145d662a3b9e34085dea460fb06ede9b69b upstream.
    
    [BUG]
    Btrfs can create compressed extent without checksum (even though it
    shouldn't), and if we then try to replace device containing such extent,
    the result device will contain all the uncompressed data instead of the
    compressed one.
    
    Test case already submitted to fstests:
    https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10442353/
    
    [CAUSE]
    When handling compressed extent without checksum, device replace will
    goe into copy_nocow_pages() function.
    
    In that function, btrfs will get all inodes referring to this data
    extents and then use find_or_create_page() to get pages direct from that
    inode.
    
    The problem here is, pages directly from inode are always uncompressed.
    And for compressed data extent, they mismatch with on-disk data.
    Thus this leads to corrupted compressed data extent written to replace
    device.
    
    [FIX]
    In this attempt, we could just remove the "optimization" branch, and let
    unified scrub_pages() to handle it.
    
    Although scrub_pages() won't bother reusing page cache, it will be a
    little slower, but it does the correct csum checking and won't cause
    such data corruption caused by "optimization".
    
    Note about the fix: this is the minimal fix that can be backported to
    older stable trees without conflicts. The whole callchain from
    copy_nocow_pages() can be deleted, and will be in followup patches.

    Btrfs: fix memory and mount leak in btrfs_ioctl_rm_dev_v2()
    
    commit fd4e994bd1f9dc9628e168a7f619bf69f6984635 upstream.
    
    If we have invalid flags set, when we error out we must drop our writer
    counter and free the buffer we allocated for the arguments. This bug is
    trivially reproduced with the following program on 4.7+:
    
            #include <fcntl.h>
            #include <stdint.h>
            #include <stdio.h>
            #include <stdlib.h>
            #include <unistd.h>

            #include <sys/types.h>
            #include <linux/btrfs.h>
            #include <linux/btrfs_tree.h>
    
            int main(int argc, char **argv)
            {
                    struct btrfs_ioctl_vol_args_v2 vol_args = {
                            .flags = UINT64_MAX,
                    };
                    int ret;
                    int fd;
    
                    if (argc != 2) {
                            fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s PATH\n", argv[0]);
                            return EXIT_FAILURE;
                    }
    
                    fd = open(argv[1], O_WRONLY);
                    if (fd == -1) {
                            perror("open");
                            return EXIT_FAILURE;
                    }
    
                    ret = ioctl(fd, BTRFS_IOC_RM_DEV_V2, &vol_args);
                    if (ret == -1)
                            perror("ioctl");
    
                    close(fd);
                    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
            }
    
    When unmounting the filesystem, we'll hit the
    WARN_ON(mnt_get_writers(mnt)) in cleanup_mnt() and also may prevent the
    filesystem to be remounted read-only as the writer count will stay
    lifted.

    Btrfs: fix clone vs chattr NODATASUM race
    
    commit b5c40d598f5408bd0ca22dfffa82f03cd9433f23 upstream.
    
    In btrfs_clone_files(), we must check the NODATASUM flag while the
    inodes are locked. Otherwise, it's possible that btrfs_ioctl_setflags()
    will change the flags after we check and we can end up with a party
    checksummed file.
    
    The race window is only a few instructions in size, between the if and
    the locks which is:
    
    3834         if (S_ISDIR(src->i_mode) || S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode))
    3835                 return -EISDIR;
    
    where the setflags must be run and toggle the NODATASUM flag (provided
    the file size is 0).  The clone will block on the inode lock, segflags
    takes the inode lock, changes flags, releases log and clone continues.
    
    Not impossible but still needs a lot of bad luck to hit unintentionally.

    driver core: Don't ignore class_dir_create_and_add() failure.
    
    commit 84d0c27d6233a9ba0578b20f5a09701eb66cee42 upstream.
    
    syzbot is hitting WARN() at kernfs_add_one() [1].
    This is because kernfs_create_link() is confused by previous device_add()
    call which continued without setting dev->kobj.parent field when
    get_device_parent() failed by memory allocation fault injection.
    Fix this by propagating the error from class_dir_create_and_add() to
    the calllers of get_device_parent().

    ext4: fix fencepost error in check for inode count overflow during resize
    
    commit 4f2f76f751433908364ccff82f437a57d0e6e9b7 upstream.
    
    ext4_resize_fs() has an off-by-one bug when checking whether growing of
    a filesystem will not overflow inode count. As a result it allows a
    filesystem with 8192 inodes per group to grow to 64TB which overflows
    inode count to 0 and makes filesystem unusable. Fix it.

    ext4: correctly handle a zero-length xattr with a non-zero e_value_offs
    
    commit 8a2b307c21d4b290e3cbe33f768f194286d07c23 upstream.
    
    Ext4 will always create ext4 extended attributes which do not have a
    value (where e_value_size is zero) with e_value_offs set to zero.  In
    most places e_value_offs will not be used in a substantive way if
    e_value_size is zero.
    
    There was one exception to this, which is in ext4_xattr_set_entry(),
    where if there is a maliciously crafted file system where there is an
    extended attribute with e_value_offs is non-zero and e_value_size is
    0, the attempt to remove this xattr will result in a negative value
    getting passed to memmove, leading to the following sadness:

    ext4: bubble errors from ext4_find_inline_data_nolock() up to ext4_iget()
    
    commit eb9b5f01c33adebc31cbc236c02695f605b0e417 upstream.
    
    If ext4_find_inline_data_nolock() returns an error it needs to get
    reflected up to ext4_iget().  In order to fix this,
    ext4_iget_extra_inode() needs to return an error (and not return
    void).
    
    This is related to "ext4: do not allow external inodes for inline
    data" (which fixes CVE-2018-11412) in that in the errors=continue
    case, it would be useful to for userspace to receive an error
    indicating that file system is corrupted.

    ext4: do not allow external inodes for inline data
    
    commit 117166efb1ee8f13c38f9e96b258f16d4923f888 upstream.
    
    The inline data feature was implemented before we added support for
    external inodes for xattrs.  It makes no sense to support that
    combination, but the problem is that there are a number of extended
    attribute checks that are skipped if e_value_inum is non-zero.
    
    Unfortunately, the inline data code is completely e_value_inum
    unaware, and attempts to interpret the xattr fields as if it were an
    inline xattr --- at which point, Hilarty Ensues.
    
    This addresses CVE-2018-11412.

    commit eee597ac931305eff3d3fd1d61d6aae553bc0984 upstream.
    
    Currently in ext4_punch_hole we're going to skip the mtime update if
    there are no actual blocks to release. However we've actually modified
    the file by zeroing the partial block so the mtime should be updated.
    
    Moreover the sync and datasync handling is skipped as well, which is
    also wrong. Fix it.

    ext4: fix hole length detection in ext4_ind_map_blocks()
    
    commit 2ee3ee06a8fd792765fa3267ddf928997797eec5 upstream.
    
    When ext4_ind_map_blocks() computes a length of a hole, it doesn't count
    with the fact that mapped offset may be somewhere in the middle of the
    completely empty subtree. In such case it will return too large length
    of the hole which then results in lseek(SEEK_DATA) to end up returning
    an incorrect offset beyond the end of the hole.
    
    Fix the problem by correctly taking offset within a subtree into account
    when computing a length of a hole.

    tls: fix use-after-free in tls_push_record

    This happened through fault injection where aead_req allocation in
    tls_do_encryption() eventually failed and we returned -ENOMEM from
    the function. Turns out that the use-after-free is triggered from
    tls_sw_sendmsg() in the second tls_push_record(). The error then
    triggers a jump to waiting for memory in sk_stream_wait_memory()
    resp. returning immediately in case of MSG_DONTWAIT. What follows is
    the trim_both_sgl(sk, orig_size), which drops elements from the sg
    list added via tls_sw_sendmsg(). Now the use-after-free gets triggered
    when the socket is being closed, where tls_sk_proto_close() callback
    is invoked. The tls_complete_pending_work() will figure that there's
    a pending closed tls record to be flushed and thus calls into the
    tls_push_pending_closed_record() from there. ctx->push_pending_record()
    is called from the latter, which is the tls_sw_push_pending_record()
    from sw path. This again calls into tls_push_record(). And here the
    tls_fill_prepend() will panic since the buffer address has been freed
    earlier via trim_both_sgl(). One way to fix it is to move the aead
    request allocation out of tls_do_encryption() early into tls_push_record().
    This means we don't prep the tls header and advance state to the
    TLS_PENDING_CLOSED_RECORD before allocation which could potentially
    fail happened. That fixes the issue on my side.

    hv_netvsc: Fix a network regression after ifdown/ifup
    
    [ Upstream commit 52acf73b6e9a6962045feb2ba5a8921da2201915 ]
    
    Recently people reported the NIC stops working after
    "ifdown eth0; ifup eth0". It turns out in this case the TX queues are not
    enabled, after the refactoring of the common detach logic: when the NIC
    has sub-channels, usually we enable all the TX queues after all
    sub-channels are set up: see rndis_set_subchannel() ->
    netif_device_attach(), but in the case of "ifdown eth0; ifup eth0" where
    the number of channels doesn't change, we also must make sure the TX queues
    are enabled. The patch fixes the regression.

    net: in virtio_net_hdr only add VLAN_HLEN to csum_start if payload holds vlan
    
    [ Upstream commit fd3a88625844907151737fc3b4201676effa6d27 ]
    
    Tun, tap, virtio, packet and uml vector all use struct virtio_net_hdr
    to communicate packet metadata to userspace.
    
    For skbuffs with vlan, the first two return the packet as it may have
    existed on the wire, inserting the VLAN tag in the user buffer.  Then
    virtio_net_hdr.csum_start needs to be adjusted by VLAN_HLEN bytes.
    
    Commit f09e2249c4f5 ("macvtap: restore vlan header on user read")
    added this feature to macvtap. Commit 3ce9b20f1971 ("macvtap: Fix
    csum_start when VLAN tags are present") then fixed up csum_start.
    
    Virtio, packet and uml do not insert the vlan header in the user
    buffer.
    
    When introducing virtio_net_hdr_from_skb to deduplicate filling in
    the virtio_net_hdr, the variant from macvtap which adds VLAN_HLEN was
    applied uniformly, breaking csum offset for packets with vlan on
    virtio and packet.
    
    Make insertion of VLAN_HLEN optional. Convert the callers to pass it
    when needed.

    udp: fix rx queue len reported by diag and proc interface
    
    [ Upstream commit 6c206b20092a3623184cff9470dba75d21507874 ]
    
    After commit 6b229cf77d68 ("udp: add batching to udp_rmem_release()")
    the sk_rmem_alloc field does not measure exactly anymore the
    receive queue length, because we batch the rmem release. The issue
    is really apparent only after commit 0d4a6608f68c ("udp: do rmem bulk
    free even if the rx sk queue is empty"): the user space can easily
    check for an empty socket with not-0 queue length reported by the 'ss'
    tool or the procfs interface.
    
    We need to use a custom UDP helper to report the correct queue length,
    taking into account the forward allocation deficit.

    socket: close race condition between sock_close() and sockfs_setattr()
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d8c50dcb029872b298eea68cc6209c866fd3e14 ]
    
    fchownat() doesn't even hold refcnt of fd until it figures out
    fd is really needed (otherwise is ignored) and releases it after
    it resolves the path. This means sock_close() could race with
    sockfs_setattr(), which leads to a NULL pointer dereference
    since typically we set sock->sk to NULL in ->release().
    
    As pointed out by Al, this is unique to sockfs. So we can fix this
    in socket layer by acquiring inode_lock in sock_close() and
    checking against NULL in sockfs_setattr().
    
    sock_release() is called in many places, only the sock_close()
    path matters here. And fortunately, this should not affect normal
    sock_close() as it is only called when the last fd refcnt is gone.
    It only affects sock_close() with a parallel sockfs_setattr() in
    progress, which is not common.

    tcp: verify the checksum of the first data segment in a new connection
    
    [ Upstream commit 4fd44a98ffe0d048246efef67ed640fdf2098a62 ]
    
    commit 079096f103fa ("tcp/dccp: install syn_recv requests into ehash
    table") introduced an optimization for the handling of child sockets
    created for a new TCP connection.
    
    But this optimization passes any data associated with the last ACK of the
    connection handshake up the stack without verifying its checksum, because it
    calls tcp_child_process(), which in turn calls tcp_rcv_state_process()
    directly.  These lower-level processing functions do not do any checksum
    verification.
    
    Insert a tcp_checksum_complete call in the TCP_NEW_SYN_RECEIVE path to
    fix this.

    net: phy: dp83822: use BMCR_ANENABLE instead of BMSR_ANEGCAPABLE for DP83620
    
    [ Upstream commit b718e8c8f4f5920aaddc2e52d5e32f494c91129c ]
    
    DP83620 register set is compatible with the DP83848, but it also supports
    100base-FX. When the hardware is configured such as that fiber mode is
    enabled, autonegotiation is not possible.
    
    The chip, however, doesn't expose this information via BMSR_ANEGCAPABLE.
    Instead, this bit is always set high, even if the particular hardware
    configuration makes it so that auto negotiation is not possible [1]. Under
    these circumstances, the phy subsystem keeps trying for autonegotiation to
    happen, without success.
    
    Hereby, we inspect BMCR_ANENABLE bit after genphy_config_init, which on
    reset is set to 0 when auto negotiation is disabled, and so we use this
    value instead of BMSR_ANEGCAPABLE.

    cdc_ncm: avoid padding beyond end of skb
    
    [ Upstream commit 49c2c3f246e2fc3009039e31a826333dcd0283cd ]
    
    Commit 4a0e3e989d66 ("cdc_ncm: Add support for moving NDP to end
    of NCM frame") added logic to reserve space for the NDP at the
    end of the NTB/skb.  This reservation did not take the final
    alignment of the NDP into account, causing us to reserve too
    little space. Additionally the padding prior to NDP addition did
    not ensure there was enough space for the NDP.
    
    The NTB/skb with the NDP appended would then exceed the configured
    max size. This caused the final padding of the NTB to use a
    negative count, padding to almost INT_MAX, and resulting in:
