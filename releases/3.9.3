    target: Use FD_MAX_SECTORS/FD_BLOCKSIZE for blockdevs using fileio
    
    commit e3e84cda321703b123f36488f50700f371bc7230 upstream.
    
    We can still see the error reported in
    
    https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2338981/
    
    when using fileio backed by a block device.
    
    I'm assuming this will get us past that error (from sbc_parse_cdb),
    and also assuming it's OK to have our max_sectors be larger than
    the block's queue max hw sectors?

    audit: Make testing for a valid loginuid explicit.
    
    commit 780a7654cee8d61819512385e778e4827db4bfbc upstream.
    
    audit rule additions containing "-F auid!=4294967295" were failing
    with EINVAL because of a regression caused by e1760bd.
    
    Apparently some userland audit rule sets want to know if loginuid uid
    has been set and are using a test for auid != 4294967295 to determine
    that.
    
    In practice that is a horrible way to ask if a value has been set,
    because it relies on subtle implementation details and will break
    every time the uid implementation in the kernel changes.
    
    So add a clean way to test if the audit loginuid has been set, and
    silently convert the old idiom to the cleaner and more comprehensible
    new idiom.
    
    RGB notes: In upstream, audit_rule_to_entry has been refactored out.
    This is patch is already upstream in functionally the same form in
    commit 780a7654cee8d61819512385e778e4827db4bfbc .  The decimal constant
    was cast to unsigned to quiet GCC 4.6 32-bit architecture warnings.

    parisc: make default cross compiler search more robust (v3)
    
    commit 6880b0150a7c25fd75c5ece80abc49ebf53c38c1 upstream.
    
    People/distros vary how they prefix the toolchain name for 64bit builds.
    Rather than enforce one convention over another, add a for loop which
    does a search for all the general prefixes.
    
    For 64bit builds, we now search for (in order):
            hppa64-unknown-linux-gnu
            hppa64-linux-gnu
            hppa64-linux
    
    For 32bit builds, we look for:
            hppa-unknown-linux-gnu
            hppa-linux-gnu
            hppa-linux
            hppa2.0-unknown-linux-gnu
            hppa2.0-linux-gnu
            hppa2.0-linux
            hppa1.1-unknown-linux-gnu

    parisc: fix SMP races when updating PTE and TLB entries in entry.S
    
    commit f0a18819e261afc5fdbd8c5c6f9943123c5461ba upstream.
    
    Currently, race conditions exist in the handling of TLB interruptions in
    entry.S.  In particular, dirty bit updates can be lost if an accessed
    interruption occurs just after the dirty bit interruption on a different
    cpu.  Lost dirty bit updates result in user pages not being flushed and
    general system instability.  This change adds lock and unlock macros to
    synchronize all PTE and TLB updates done in entry.S.  As a result,
    userspace stability is significantly improved.

    parisc: only re-enable interrupts if we need to schedule or deliver signals when returning to userspace
    
    commit c207a76bf155cb5cf24cf849c08f6555e9180594 upstream.
    
    Helge and I have found that we have a kernel stack overflow problem
    which causes a variety of random failures.
    Currently, we re-enable interrupts when returning from an external
    interrupt incase we need to schedule or delivery
    signals.  As a result, a potentially unlimited number of interrupts
    can occur while we are running on the kernel
    stack.  It is very limited in space (currently, 16k).  This change
    defers enabling interrupts until we have
    actually decided to schedule or delivery signals.  This only occurs
    when we about to return to userspace.  This
    limits the number of interrupts on the kernel stack to one.  In other
    cases, interrupts remain disabled until the
    final return from interrupt (rfi).

    usermodehelper: check subprocess_info->path != NULL
    
    commit 264b83c07a84223f0efd0d1db9ccc66d6f88288f upstream.
    
    argv_split(empty_or_all_spaces) happily succeeds, it simply returns
    argc == 0 and argv[0] == NULL. Change call_usermodehelper_exec() to
    check sub_info->path != NULL to avoid the crash.
    
    This is the minimal fix, todo:
    
     - perhaps we should change argv_split() to return NULL or change the
       callers.
    
     - kill or justify ->path[0] check
    
     - narrow the scope of helper_lock()

    When UMS was deprecated it removed support for nomodeset commandline
    we really want this in distro land so we can debug stuff, everyone
    should fallback to vesa correctly.
    
    v2: oops -1 isn't used anymore, restore original behaviour
    -1 is default, so we can boot with nomodeset on the command line,
    then use radeon.modeset=1 to override it for debugging later.

    ACPI / EC: Restart transaction even when the IBF flag set
    
    commit 28fe5c825f8e15744d04c7c1b8df197950923ecd upstream.
    
    The EC driver works abnormally with IBF flag always set.
    IBF means "The host has written a byte of data to the command
    or data port, but the embedded controller has not yet read it".
    If IBF is set in the EC status and not cleared, this will cause
    all subsequent EC requests to fail with a timeout error.
    
    Change the EC driver so that it doesn't refuse to restart a
    transaction if IBF is set in the status.  Also increase the
    number of transaction restarts to 5, as it turns out that 2
    is not sufficient in some cases.
    
    This bug happens on several different machines (Asus V1S,
    Dell Latitude E6530, Samsung R719, Acer Aspire 5930G,
    Sony Vaio SR19VN and others).

    cpufreq / intel_pstate: fix ffmpeg regression
    
    commit ca182aee389f8026401510f4c63841cb02c820e8 upstream.
    
    The ffmpeg benchmark in the phoronix test suite has threads on
    multiple cores that rely on the progress on of threads on other cores
    and ping pong back and forth fast enough to make the core appear less
    busy than it "should" be.  If the core has been at minimum p-state for
    a while bump the pstate up to kick the core to see if it is in this
    ping pong state.  If the core is truly idle the p-state will be
    reduced at the next sample time.  If the core makes more progress it
    will send more work to the thread bringing both threads out of the
    ping pong scenario and the p-state will be selected normally.
    
    This fixes a performance regression of approximately 30%

    commit d8f469e9cff3bc4a6317d923e9506be046aa7bdc upstream.
    
    There are two ways that the maximum p-state can be clamped, via a
    policy change and via the sysfs file.
    
    The acpi-thermal driver adjusts the p-state policy in response to
    thermal events.  These changes override the users settings at the
    moment.
    
    Use the lowest of the two requested values this ensures that we will

    cpufreq / intel_pstate: remove idle time and duration from sample and calculations
    
    commit 1abc4b20b85b42e8573957e54b193385cf48b0d6 upstream.
    
    Idle time is taken into account in the APERF/MPERF ratio calculation
    there is no reason for the driver to track it seperately.  This
    reduces the work in the driver and makes the code more readable.
    
    Removal of the tracking of sample duration removes the possibility of
    the divide by zero exception when the duration is sub 1us

    ARM: EXYNOS5: Fix kernel dump in AFTR idle mode
    
    commit 088584618836b159947bc4ab5011a5cf1f081a62 upstream.
    
    The kernel crashes while resuming from AFTR idle mode. It happens
    because L2 cache was not going into retention state.
    
    This patch configures the USE_RETENTION bit of ARM_L2_OPTION register
    so that it does not depend on MANUAL_L2RSTDISABLE_CONTROL of
    ARM_COMMON_OPTION register for L2RSTDISABLE signal.

    VSOCK: Drop bogus __init annotation from vsock_init_tables()
    
    commit 22ee3b57c3ff71772b0c4178404b04f5df78d501 upstream.
    
    If gcc (e.g. 4.1.2) decides not to inline vsock_init_tables(), this will
    cause a section mismatch:
    
    WARNING: net/vmw_vsock/vsock.o(.text+0x1bc): Section mismatch in reference from the function __vsock_core_init() to the function .init.text:vsock_init_tables()
    The function __vsock_core_init() references
    the function __init vsock_init_tables().
    This is often because __vsock_core_init lacks a __init
    annotation or the annotation of vsock_init_tables is wrong.
    
    This may cause crashes if VSOCKETS=y and VMWARE_VMCI_VSOCKETS=m.

    drbd: fix for deadlock when using automatic split-brain-recovery
    
    commit 7c689e63a847316c1b2500f86891b0a574ce7e69 upstream.
    
    With an automatic after split-brain recovery policy of
    "after-sb-1pri call-pri-lost-after-sb",
    when trying to drbd_set_role() to R_SECONDARY,
    we run into a deadlock.
    
    This was first recognized and supposedly fixed by
    2009-06-10 "Fixed a deadlock when using automatic split brain recovery when both nodes are"
    replacing drbd_set_role() with drbd_change_state() in that code-path,
    but the first hunk of that patch forgets to remove the drbd_set_role().
    
    We apparently only ever tested the "two primaries" case.

    watchdog: Fix race condition in registration code
    
    commit 60403f7a4d9368d187f79cba5e4672d01df37574 upstream.
    
    A race condition exists when registering the first watchdog device.
    Sequence of events:
    
    - watchdog_register_device calls watchdog_dev_register
    - watchdog_dev_register creates the watchdog misc device by calling
      misc_register.
      At that time, the matching character device (/dev/watchdog0) does not yet
      exist, and old_wdd is not set either.
    - Userspace gets an event and opens /dev/watchdog
    - watchdog_open is called and sets wdd = old_wdd, which is still NULL,
      and tries to dereference it. This causes the kernel to panic.
    
    Seen with systemd trying to open /dev/watchdog immediately after
    it was created.

    ipv6: do not clear pinet6 field
    
    [ Upstream commit f77d602124d865c38705df7fa25c03de9c284ad2 ]
    
    We have seen multiple NULL dereferences in __inet6_lookup_established()
    
    After analysis, I found that inet6_sk() could be NULL while the
    check for sk_family == AF_INET6 was true.
    
    Bug was added in linux-2.6.29 when RCU lookups were introduced in UDP
    and TCP stacks.
    
    Once an IPv6 socket, using SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU is inserted in a hash
    table, we no longer can clear pinet6 field.
    
    This patch extends logic used in commit fcbdf09d9652c891
    ("net: fix nulls list corruptions in sk_prot_alloc")
    
    TCP/UDP/UDPLite IPv6 protocols provide their own .clear_sk() method
    to make sure we do not clear pinet6 field.
    
    At socket clone phase, we do not really care, as cloning the parent (non
    NULL) pinet6 is not adding a fatal race.

    macvlan: fix passthru mode race between dev removal and rx path
    
    [ Upstream commit 233c7df0821c4190e2d3f4be0f2ca0ab40a5ed8c ]
    
    Currently, if macvlan in passthru mode is created and data are rxed and
    you remove this device, following panic happens:
    
    NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000198
    IP: [<ffffffffa0196058>] macvlan_handle_frame+0x153/0x1f7 [macvlan]
    
    I'm using following script to trigger this:
    <script>
    while [ 1 ]
    do
            ip link add link e1 name macvtap0 type macvtap mode passthru
            ip link set e1 up
            ip link set macvtap0 up
            IFINDEX=`ip link |grep macvtap0 | cut -f 1 -d ':'`
            cat /dev/tap$IFINDEX  >/dev/null &
            ip link del dev macvtap0
    done
    </script>
    
    I run this script while "ping -f" is running on another machine to send
    packets to e1 rx.
    
    Reason of the panic is that list_first_entry() is blindly called in
    macvlan_handle_frame() even if the list was empty. vlan is set to
    incorrect pointer which leads to the crash.
    
    I'm fixing this by protecting port->vlans list by rcu and by preventing
    from getting incorrect pointer in case the list is empty.

    [ Upstream commit c81400be716aa4c76f6ebf339ba94358dbbf6da6 ]
    
    When unloading the driver that drives an EISA board, a message similar to the

    Then an user is unable to reload the driver because the resource it requested in
    the previous load hasn't been freed. This happens most probably due to a typo in
    vortex_eisa_remove() which calls release_region() with 'dev->base_addr'  instead
    of 'edev->base_addr'...

    net: frag, fix race conditions in LRU list maintenance
    
    [ Upstream commit b56141ab34e2c3e2d7960cea12c20c99530c0c76 ]
    
    This patch fixes race between inet_frag_lru_move() and inet_frag_lru_add()
    which was introduced in commit 3ef0eb0db4bf92c6d2510fe5c4dc51852746f206
    ("net: frag, move LRU list maintenance outside of rwlock")
    
    One cpu already added new fragment queue into hash but not into LRU.
    Other cpu found it in hash and tries to move it to the end of LRU.
    This leads to NULL pointer dereference inside of list_move_tail().
    
    Another possible race condition is between inet_frag_lru_move() and
    inet_frag_lru_del(): move can happens after deletion.
    
    This patch initializes LRU list head before adding fragment into hash and
    inet_frag_lru_move() doesn't touches it if it's empty.
    
    I saw this kernel oops two times in a couple of days.

    [ Upstream commit 77d21f23a1e4db8639e3916547c903a3b3c7a07c ]
    
    Programs using virtio headers outside of kernel will no longer
    build because u16 type does not exist in userspace. All user ABI

    packet: tpacket_v3: do not trigger bug() on wrong header status
    
    [ Upstream commit 8da3056c04bfc5f69f840ab038a38389e2de8189 ]
    
    Jakub reported that it is fairly easy to trigger the BUG() macro
    from user space with TPACKET_V3's RX_RING by just giving a wrong
    header status flag. We already had a similar situation in commit
    7f5c3e3a80e6654 (``af_packet: remove BUG statement in
    tpacket_destruct_skb'') where this was the case in the TX_RING
    side that could be triggered from user space. So really, don't use
    BUG() or BUG_ON() unless there's really no way out, and i.e.
    don't use it for consistency checking when there's user space
    involved, no excuses, especially not if you're slapping the user
    with WARN + dump_stack + BUG all at once. The two functions are
    of concern:
    
      prb_retire_current_block() [when block status != TP_STATUS_KERNEL]
      prb_open_block() [when block_status != TP_STATUS_KERNEL]
    
    Calls to prb_open_block() are guarded by ealier checks if block_status
    is really TP_STATUS_KERNEL (racy!), but the first one BUG() is easily
    triggable from user space. System behaves still stable after they are
    removed. Also remove that yoda condition entirely, since it's already
    guarded.

    asix: fix BUG in receive path when lowering MTU
    
    [ Upstream commit c5060cec6ba27ad3f0e7facfdf05d2f18e3e3010 ]
    
    There is bug in the receive path of the asix driver at the time a
    packet is received larger than MTU size and DF bit set:
    
     BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 0000004000000001
     IP: [<ffffffff8126f65b>] skb_release_head_state+0x2d/0xd2
     ...
     Call Trace:
      <IRQ>
      [<ffffffff8126f86d>] ? skb_release_all+0x9/0x1e
      [<ffffffff8126f8ad>] ? __kfree_skb+0x9/0x6f
      [<ffffffffa00b4200>] ? asix_rx_fixup_internal+0xff/0x1ae [asix]
      [<ffffffffa00fb3dc>] ? usbnet_bh+0x4f/0x226 [usbnet]
      ...
    
    It is easily reproducable by setting an MTU of 512 e. g. and sending
    something like
    
      ping -s 1472 -c 1 -M do $SELF
    
    from another box.
    
    And this is because the rx->ax_skb is freed on error, but rx->ax_skb
    is not reset, and the size is not reset to zero in this case.
    
    And since the skb is added again to the usbnet->done skb queue it is
    accessing already freed memory, resulting in the BUG when freeing a
    2nd time.  I therefore think the value 0x0000004000000001 show in the
    trace is more or less random data.

    bridge: fix race with topology change timer
    
    [ Upstream commit 83401eb4990ff6af55aeed8f49681558544192e6 ]
    
    A bridge should only send topology change notice if it is not
    the root bridge. It is possible for message age timer to elect itself
    as a new root bridge, and still have a topology change timer running
    but waiting for bridge lock on other CPU.
    
    Solve the race by checking if we are root bridge before continuing.
    This was the root cause of the cases where br_send_tcn_bpdu would OOPS.

    3c509.c: call SET_NETDEV_DEV for all device types (ISA/ISAPnP/EISA)
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b54912f9cd167641b91d4a697bd742f70e534fe ]
    
    The venerable 3c509 driver only sets its device parent in one case, the ISAPnP one.
    It does this with the SET_NETDEV_DEV function. It should register with the device
    hierarchy in two additional cases: standard (non-PnP) ISA and EISA.
    
    - Currently they appear here:
    /sys/devices/virtual/net/eth0 (standard ISA)
    /sys/devices/virtual/net/eth1 (EISA)
    
    - Rather, they should instead be here:
    /sys/devices/isa/3c509.0/net/eth0 (standard ISA)
    /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:07.0/00:04/net/eth1 (EISA)

    tcp: reset timer after any SYNACK retransmit
    
    [ Upstream commit cd75eff64dae8856afbf6ef0f0ca3c145465d8e0 ]
    
    Linux immediately returns SYNACK on (spurious) SYN retransmits, but
    keeps the SYNACK timer running independently. Thus the timer may
    fire right after the SYNACK retransmit and causes a SYN-SYNACK
    cross-fire burst.
    
    Adopt the fast retransmit/recovery idea in established state by
    re-arming the SYNACK timer after the fast (SYNACK) retransmit. The
    timer may fire late up to 500ms due to the current SYNACK timer wheel,
    but it's OK to be conservative when network is congested. Eric's new
    listener design should address this issue.

    sfc: Fix naming of MTD partitions for FPGA bitfiles
    
    [ Upstream commit 89cc80a44b7c320e08599cb86f6aef0ead8986a1 ]
    
    efx_mcdi_get_board_cfg() uses a buffer for the firmware response that
    is only large enough to hold subtypes for the originally defined set
    of NVRAM partitions.  Longer responses are truncated, and we may read
    off the end of the buffer when copying out subtypes for additional
    partitions.  In particular, this can result in the MTD partition for
    an FPGA bitfile being named e.g. 'eth5 sfc_fpga:00' when it should be
    'eth5 sfc_fpga:01'.  This means the firmware update tool (sfupdate)
    can't tell which bitfile should be written to the partition.
    
    Correct the response buffer size.

    drm: don't check modeset locks in panic handler
    
    commit a9b054e8ab06504c2afa0e307ee78d3778993a1d upstream.
    
    Since we know that locking is broken in that case and it's more
    important to not flood the dmesg with random gunk.

    Higher bits of the base address of framebuffers weren't being

    drm/mgag200: Fix writes into MGA1064_PIX_CLK_CTL register
    
    commit fb70a6690875315a3a1454e52fa339441ee7612b upstream.
    
    The original line,
      WREG_DAC(MGA1064_PIX_CLK_CTL_CLK_DIS, tmp);
    wrote tmp into MGA1064_PIX_CLK_CTL_CLK_DIS, where
    MGA1064_PIX_CLK_CTL_CLK_DIS is an offset into
    MGA1064_PIX_CLK_CTL. Change the line to write properly into
    MGA1064_PIX_CLK_CTL. There were other chunks of code nearby that use
    the same pattern (but work correctly), so this patch updates them all
    to use this new (slightly more efficient) write pattern. The WREG_DAC
    macro was causing the DAC_INDEX register to be set to the same value
    twice. WREG8(DAC_DATA, foo) takes advantage of the fact that DAC_INDEX
    is already at the value we want.

    iwl4965: workaround connection regression on passive channel
    
    commit dd9c46408fdc07098333655ff27edf8cac8d9fcf upstream.
    
    Jake reported that since commit 1672c0e31917f49d31d30d79067103432bc20cc7
    "mac80211: start auth/assoc timeout on frame status", he is unable to
    connect to his AP, which is configured to use passive channel.
    
    After switch to passive channel 4965 firmware drops any TX packet until
    it receives beacon. Before commit 1672c0e3 we waited on channel and
    retransmit packet after 200ms, that makes we receive beacon on the
    meantime and association process succeed. New mac80211 behaviour cause
    that any ASSOC frame fail immediately on iwl4965 and we can not
    associate.
    
    This patch restore old mac80211 behaviour for iwl4965, by removing
    IEEE80211_HW_REPORTS_TX_ACK_STATUS feature. This feature will be
    added again to iwl4965 driver, when different, more complex
    workaround for this firmware issue, will be added to the driver.

    B43: Handle DMA RX descriptor underrun
    
    commit 73b82bf0bfbf58e6ff328d3726934370585f6e78 upstream.
    
    Add handling of rx descriptor underflow. This fixes a fault that could
    happen on slow machines, where data is received faster than the CPU can
    handle. In such a case the device will use up all rx descriptors and
    refuse to send any more data before confirming that it is ok. This
    patch enables necessary interrupt to discover such a situation and will
    handle them by dropping everything in the ring buffer.

    tile: support new Tilera hypervisor
    
    commit c539914dcd9a68c63305e055b14115a6a19578a8 upstream.
    
    The Tilera hypervisor shipped in releases up through MDE 4.1 launches
    the client operating system (i.e. Linux) at privilege level 1 (PL1).
    Starting with MDE 4.2, as part of the work to enable KVM, the
    Tilera hypervisor launches Linux at PL2 instead.
    
    This commit makes the KERNEL_PL option default to 2 for tilegx, while
    still saying at 1 for tilepro, which doesn't have an updated hypervisor.
    It also explains how and when you might want to choose another value.
    In addition, we change a small buglet in the on-chip Ethernet driver,
    where we were failing to use the KERNEL_PL constant in an API call.
    
    To make the transition cleaner, this change also provides the updated
    hv_init() API for the new hypervisor that supports announcing Linux's
    compiled-in PL, so the hypervisor can generate a suitable error in the
    case of a mismatched hypervisor and Linux binary.

    mwifiex: fix setting of multicast filter
    
    commit ccd384b10420ac81ba3fb9b0a7d18272c7173552 upstream.
    
    A small bug in this code was causing the ALLMULTI filter to be set
    when in fact we were just wanting to program a selective multicast list
    to the hardware.
    
    Fix that bug and remove a redundant if condition in the code that
    follows.
    
    This fixes wakeup behaviour when multicast WOL is enabled. Previously,
    all multicast packets would wake up the system. Now, only those that the
    host intended to receive trigger wakeups.

    mwifiex: clear is_suspended flag when interrupt is received early
    
    commit 48795424acff7215d5eac0b52793a2c1eb3a6283 upstream.
    
    When the XO-4 with 8787 wireless is woken up due to wake-on-WLAN
    mwifiex is often flooded with "not allowed while suspended" messages
    and the interface is unusable.
    
    [  202.171609] int: sdio_ireg = 0x1
    [  202.180700] info: mwifiex_process_hs_config: auto cancelling host
                   sleep since there is interrupt from the firmware
    [  202.201880] event: wakeup device...
    [  202.211452] event: hs_deactivated
    [  202.514638] info: --- Rx: Data packet ---
    [  202.514753] data: 4294957544 BSS(0-0): Data <= kernel
    [  202.514825] PREP_CMD: device in suspended state
    [  202.514839] data: dequeuing the packet ec7248c0 ec4869c0
    [  202.514886] mwifiex_write_data_sync: not allowed while suspended
    [  202.514886] host_to_card, write iomem (1) failed: -1
    [  202.514917] mwifiex_write_data_sync: not allowed while suspended
    [  202.514936] host_to_card, write iomem (2) failed: -1
    [  202.514949] mwifiex_write_data_sync: not allowed while suspended
    [  202.514965] host_to_card, write iomem (3) failed: -1
    [  202.514976] mwifiex_write_data_async failed: 0xFFFFFFFF
    
    This can be readily reproduced when putting the XO-4 in a loop where
    it goes to sleep due to inactivity, but then wakes up due to an
    incoming ping. The error is hit within an hour or two.
    
    This issue happens when an interrupt comes in early while host sleep
    is still activated. Driver handles this case by auto cancelling host
    sleep. However is_suspended flag is still set which prevents any cmd
    or data from being sent to firmware. Fix it by clearing is_suspended
    flag in this path.

    If the key index is not checked for errors, it can lead to logspam that

    powerpc/kexec: Fix kexec when using VMX optimised memcpy
    
    commit 79c66ce8f6448a3295a32efeac88c9debd7f7094 upstream.
    
    commit b3f271e86e5a (powerpc: POWER7 optimised memcpy using VMX and
    enhanced prefetch) uses VMX when it is safe to do so (ie not in
    interrupt). It also looks at the task struct to decide if we have to
    save the current tasks' VMX state.
    
    kexec calls memcpy() at a point where the task struct may have been
    overwritten by the new kexec segments. If it has been overwritten
    then when memcpy -> enable_altivec looks up current->thread.regs->msr
    we get a cryptic oops or lockup.
    
    I also notice we aren't initialising thread_info->cpu, which means
    smp_processor_id is broken. Fix that too.

    This patch brings online all threads which are present but not online
    prior to migration/hibernation.  After migration/hibernation those
    threads are taken back offline.
    
    During migration/hibernation all online CPUs must call H_JOIN, this is
    required by the hypervisor.  Without this patch, threads that are offline
    (H_CEDE'd) will not be woken to make the H_JOIN call and the OS will be
    deadlocked (all threads either JOIN'd or CEDE'd).

    ARM: 7720/1: ARM v6/v7 cmpxchg64 shouldn't clear upper 32 bits of the old/new value
    
    commit 6eabb3301b1facee669d9938f7c5a0295c21d71d upstream.
    
    The implementation of cmpxchg64() for the ARM v6 and v7 architecture
    casts parameter 2 and 3 (the old and new 64bit values) to an unsigned
    long before calling the atomic_cmpxchg64() function. This clears
    the top 32 bits of the old and new values, resulting in the wrong
    values being compare-exchanged. Luckily, this only appears to be used
    for 64-bit sched_clock, which we don't (yet) have on ARM.
    
    This bug was introduced by commit 3e0f5a15f500 ("ARM: 7404/1: cmpxchg64:
    use atomic64 and local64 routines for cmpxchg64").

    x86/microcode: Add local mutex to fix physical CPU hot-add deadlock
    
    commit 074d72ff57f65de779e2f70d5906964c0ba1c123 upstream.
    
    This can easily be triggered if a new CPU is added (via
    ACPI hotplug mechanism) and from user-space you do:
    
       echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/online
    
    (or wait for UDEV to do it) on a newly appeared physical CPU.
    
    The deadlock is that the "store_online" in drivers/base/cpu.c
    takes the cpu_hotplug_driver_lock() lock, then calls "cpu_up".
    "cpu_up" eventually ends up calling "save_mc_for_early"
    which also takes the cpu_hotplug_driver_lock() lock.
    
    And here is that lockdep thinks of it:
    
     smpboot: Stack at about ffff880075c39f44
     smpboot: CPU3: has booted.

    ext4: limit group search loop for non-extent files
    
    commit e6155736ad76b2070652745f9e54cdea3f0d8567 upstream.
    
    In the case where we are allocating for a non-extent file,
    we must limit the groups we allocate from to those below
    2^32 blocks, and ext4_mb_regular_allocator() attempts to
    do this initially by putting a cap on ngroups for the
    subsequent search loop.
    
    However, the initial target group comes in from the
    allocation context (ac), and it may already be beyond
    the artificially limited ngroups.  In this case,
    the limit
    
            if (group == ngroups)
                    group = 0;
    
    at the top of the loop is never true, and the loop will
    run away.
    
    Catch this case inside the loop and reset the search to
    start at group 0.

    tracing: Fix leaks of filter preds
    
    commit 60705c89460fdc7227f2d153b68b3f34814738a4 upstream.
    
    Special preds are created when folding a series of preds that
    can be done in serial. These are allocated in an ops field of
    the pred structure. But they were never freed, causing memory
    leaks.
    
    This was discovered using the kmemleak checker:
    
    unreferenced object 0xffff8800797fd5e0 (size 32):
      comm "swapper/0", pid 1, jiffies 4294690605 (age 104.608s)

    tick: Cleanup NOHZ per cpu data on cpu down
    
    commit 4b0c0f294f60abcdd20994a8341a95c8ac5eeb96 upstream.
    
    Prarit reported a crash on CPU offline/online. The reason is that on
    CPU down the NOHZ related per cpu data of the dead cpu is not cleaned
    up. If at cpu online an interrupt happens before the per cpu tick
    device is registered the irq_enter() check potentially sees stale data
    and dereferences a NULL pointer.
    
    Cleanup the data after the cpu is dead.

    timer: Don't reinitialize the cpu base lock during CPU_UP_PREPARE
    
    commit 42a5cf46cd56f46267d2a9fcf2655f4078cd3042 upstream.
    
    An inactive timer's base can refer to a offline cpu's base.
    
    In the current code, cpu_base's lock is blindly reinitialized each
    time a CPU is brought up. If a CPU is brought online during the period
    that another thread is trying to modify an inactive timer on that CPU
    with holding its timer base lock, then the lock will be reinitialized
    under its feet. This leads to following SPIN_BUG().
    
    <0> BUG: spinlock already unlocked on CPU#3, kworker/u:3/1466

    As an example, this particular crash occurred when CPU #3 is executing
    mod_timer() on an inactive timer whose base is refered to offlined CPU
    #2.  The code locked the timer_base corresponding to CPU #2. Before it
    could proceed, CPU #2 came online and reinitialized the spinlock
    corresponding to its base. Thus now CPU #3 held a lock which was
    reinitialized. When CPU #3 finally ended up unlocking the old cpu_base
    corresponding to CPU #2, we hit the above SPIN_BUG().
    
    CPU #0          CPU #3                                 CPU #2
    ------          -------                                -------
    .....            ......                               <Offline>
                    mod_timer()
                     lock_timer_base
                       spin_lock_irqsave(&base->lock)
    
    cpu_up(2)        .....                                  ......
                                                            init_timers_cpu()
    ....             .....                                  spin_lock_init(&base->lock)
    .....              spin_unlock_irqrestore(&base->lock)  ......
                       <spin_bug>
    
    Allocation of per_cpu timer vector bases is done only once under
    "tvec_base_done[]" check. In the current code, spinlock_initialization
    of base->lock isn't under this check. When a CPU is up each time the
    base lock is reinitialized. Move base spinlock initialization under
    the check.

    time: Revert ALWAYS_USE_PERSISTENT_CLOCK compile time optimizaitons
    
    commit b4f711ee03d28f776fd2324fd0bd999cc428e4d2 upstream.
    
    Kay Sievers noted that the ALWAYS_USE_PERSISTENT_CLOCK config,
    which enables some minor compile time optimization to avoid
    uncessary code in mostly the suspend/resume path could cause
    problems for userland.
    
    In particular, the dependency for RTC_HCTOSYS on
    !ALWAYS_USE_PERSISTENT_CLOCK, which avoids setting the time
    twice and simplifies suspend/resume, has the side effect
    of causing the /sys/class/rtc/rtcN/hctosys flag to always be
    zero, and this flag is commonly used by udev to setup the
    /dev/rtc symlink to /dev/rtcN, which can cause pain for
    older applications.
    
    While the udev rules could use some work to be less fragile,
    breaking userland should strongly be avoided. Additionally
    the compile time optimizations are fairly minor, and the code
    being optimized is likely to be reworked in the future, so
    lets revert this change.

    audit: vfs: fix audit_inode call in O_CREAT case of do_last
    
    commit 33e2208acfc15ce00d3dd13e839bf6434faa2b04 upstream.
    
    Jiri reported a regression in auditing of open(..., O_CREAT) syscalls.
    In older kernels, creating a file with open(..., O_CREAT) created
    audit_name records that looked like this:
    
    type=PATH msg=audit(1360255720.628:64): item=1 name="/abc/foo" inode=138810 dev=fd:00 mode=0100640 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 obj=unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0
    type=PATH msg=audit(1360255720.628:64): item=0 name="/abc/" inode=138635 dev=fd:00 mode=040750 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 obj=unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0
    
    ...in recent kernels though, they look like this:
    
    type=PATH msg=audit(1360255402.886:12574): item=2 name=(null) inode=264599 dev=fd:00 mode=0100640 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 obj=unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0
    type=PATH msg=audit(1360255402.886:12574): item=1 name=(null) inode=264598 dev=fd:00 mode=040750 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 obj=unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0
    type=PATH msg=audit(1360255402.886:12574): item=0 name="/abc/foo" inode=264598 dev=fd:00 mode=040750 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 obj=unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0
    
    Richard bisected to determine that the problems started with commit
    bfcec708, but the log messages have changed with some later
    audit-related patches.
    
    The problem is that this audit_inode call is passing in the parent of
    the dentry being opened, but audit_inode is being called with the parent
    flag false. This causes later audit_inode and audit_inode_child calls to
    match the wrong entry in the audit_names list.
    
    This patch simply sets the flag to properly indicate that this inode
    represents the parent. With this, the audit_names entries are back to
    looking like they did before.

    audit: Syscall rules are not applied to existing processes on non-x86
    
    commit cdee3904b4ce7c03d1013ed6dd704b43ae7fc2e9 upstream.
    
    Commit b05d8447e782 (audit: inline audit_syscall_entry to reduce
    burden on archs) changed audit_syscall_entry to check for a dummy
    context before calling __audit_syscall_entry. Unfortunately the dummy
    context state is maintained in __audit_syscall_entry so once set it
    never gets cleared, even if the audit rules change.
    
    As a result, if there are no auditing rules when a process starts
    then it will never be subject to any rules added later. x86 doesn't
    see this because it has an assembly fast path that calls directly into
    __audit_syscall_entry.
    
    I noticed this issue when working on audit performance optimisations.
    I wrote a set of simple test cases available at:
    
    http://ozlabs.org/~anton/junkcode/audit_tests.tar.gz
    
    02_new_rule.py fails without the patch and passes with it. The
    test case clears all rules, starts a process, adds a rule then
    verifies the process produces a syscall audit record.

    SCSI: sd: fix array cache flushing bug causing performance problems
    
    commit 39c60a0948cc06139e2fbfe084f83cb7e7deae3b upstream.
    
    Some arrays synchronize their full non volatile cache when the sd driver sends
    a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command.  Unfortunately, they can have Terrabytes of this
    and we send a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE for every barrier if an array reports it has a
    writeback cache.  This leads to massive slowdowns on journalled filesystems.
    
    The fix is to allow userspace to turn off the writeback cache setting as a
    temporary measure (i.e. without doing the MODE SELECT to write it back to the
    device), so even though the device reported it has a writeback cache, the
    user, knowing that the cache is non volatile and all they care about is
    filesystem correctness, can turn that bit off in the kernel and avoid the
    performance ruinous (and safety irrelevant) SYNCHRONIZE CACHE commands.
    
    The way you do this is add a 'temporary' prefix when performing the usual
    cache setting operations, so
    
    echo temporary write through > /sys/class/scsi_disk/<disk>/cache_type

    xen/vcpu/pvhvm: Fix vcpu hotplugging hanging.
    
    commit 7f1fc268c47491fd5e63548f6415fc8604e13003 upstream.
    
    If a user did:
    
            echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
            echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
    
    we would (this a build with DEBUG enabled) get to:
    smpboot: ++++++++++++++++++++=_---CPU UP  1
    .. snip..
    smpboot: Stack at about ffff880074c0ff44
    smpboot: CPU1: has booted.
    
    and hang. The RCU mechanism would kick in an try to IPI the CPU1
    but the IPIs (and all other interrupts) would never arrive at the
    CPU1. At first glance at least. A bit digging in the hypervisor
    trace shows that (using xenanalyze):
    
    [vla] d4v1 vec 243 injecting
       0.043163027 --|x d4v1 intr_window vec 243 src 5(vector) intr f3

    ]  0.043166800 --|x d4v1 vmexit exit_reason PENDING_INTERRUPT eip ffffffff81673254
       0.043166800 --|x d4v1 inj_virq vec 243  real
      [vla] d4v1 vec 243 injecting
    
    there is a pending event (subsequent debugging shows it is the IPI
    from the VCPU0 when smpboot.c on VCPU1 has done
    "set_cpu_online(smp_processor_id(), true)") and the guest VCPU1 is
    interrupted with the callback IPI (0xf3 aka 243) which ends up calling
    __xen_evtchn_do_upcall.
    
    The __xen_evtchn_do_upcall seems to do *something* but not acknowledge
    the pending events. And the moment the guest does a 'cli' (that is the
    ffffffff81673254 in the log above) the hypervisor is invoked again to
    inject the IPI (0xf3) to tell the guest it has pending interrupts.
    This repeats itself forever.
    
    The culprit was the per_cpu(xen_vcpu, cpu) pointer. At the bootup
    we set each per_cpu(xen_vcpu, cpu) to point to the
    shared_info->vcpu_info[vcpu] but later on use the VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info
    to register per-CPU  structures (xen_vcpu_setup).
    This is used to allow events for more than 32 VCPUs and for performance
    optimizations reasons.
    
    When the user performs the VCPU hotplug we end up calling the
    the xen_vcpu_setup once more. We make the hypercall which returns
    -EINVAL as it does not allow multiple registration calls (and
    already has re-assigned where the events are being set). We pick
    the fallback case and set per_cpu(xen_vcpu, cpu) to point to the
    shared_info->vcpu_info[vcpu] (which is a good fallback during bootup).
    However the hypervisor is still setting events in the register
    per-cpu structure (per_cpu(xen_vcpu_info, cpu)).
    
    As such when the events are set by the hypervisor (such as timer one),
    and when we iterate in __xen_evtchn_do_upcall we end up reading stale
    events from the shared_info->vcpu_info[vcpu] instead of the
    per_cpu(xen_vcpu_info, cpu) structures. Hence we never acknowledge the
    events that the hypervisor has set and the hypervisor keeps on reminding
    us to ack the events which we never do.
    
    The fix is simple. Don't on the second time when xen_vcpu_setup is
    called over-write the per_cpu(xen_vcpu, cpu) if it points to
    per_cpu(xen_vcpu_info).

    The error in lis3lv02_poweron() is harmless in the resume path, so
    we should ignore it. It is inline with the other usages of lis3lv02_poweron()

    The problem appears to be a regression that was introduced in commit
    9a9c6478 "nfsd: make NFSv4 recovery client tracking options per net".
    Prior to that commit, it was safe to pass a NULL net pointer to
    nfsd4_client_tracking_exit in the legacy recdir case, and
    legacy_recdir_name_error did so. After that comit, the net pointer must
    be valid.
    
    This patch just fixes legacy_recdir_name_error to pass in a valid net
    pointer to that function.

    nfsd4: don't allow owner override on 4.1 CLAIM_FH opens
    
    commit 9f415eb25574db4b73a9a712a4438e41dc284922 upstream.
    
    The Linux client is using CLAIM_FH to implement regular opens, not just
    recovery cases, so it depends on the server to check permissions
    correctly.
    
    Therefore the owner override, which may make sense in the delegation
    recovery case, isn't right in the CLAIM_FH case.
    
    Symptoms: on a client with 49f9a0fafd844c32f2abada047c0b9a5ba0d6255
    "NFSv4.1: Enable open-by-filehandle", Bryan noticed this:

            echo test > test.txt
    
    succeeding.

    sched: Avoid prev->stime underflow
    
    commit 68aa8efcd1ab961e4684ef5af32f72a6ec1911de upstream.
    
    Dave Hansen reported strange utime/stime values on his system:
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/4/4/435
    
    This happens because prev->stime value is bigger than rtime
    value. Root of the problem are non-monotonic rtime values (i.e.
    current rtime is smaller than previous rtime) and that should be
    debugged and fixed.
    
    But since problem did not manifest itself before commit
    62188451f0d63add7ad0cd2a1ae269d600c1663d "cputime: Avoid
    multiplication overflow on utime scaling", it should be threated
    as regression, which we can easily fixed on cputime_adjust()
    function.
    
    For now, let's apply this fix, but further work is needed to fix
    root of the problem.

    sched: Do not account bogus utime
    
    commit 772c808a252594692972773f6ee41c289b8e0b2a upstream.
    
    Due to rounding in scale_stime(), for big numbers, scaled stime
    values will grow in chunks. Since rtime grow in jiffies and we
    calculate utime like below:
    
            prev->stime = max(prev->stime, stime);
            prev->utime = max(prev->utime, rtime - prev->stime);
    
    we could erroneously account stime values as utime. To prevent
    that only update prev->{u,s}time values when they are smaller
    than current rtime.

    sched: Avoid cputime scaling overflow
    
    commit 55eaa7c1f511af5fb6ef808b5328804f4d4e5243 upstream.
    
    Here is patch, which adds Linus's cputime scaling algorithm to the
    kernel.
    
    This is a follow up (well, fix) to commit
    d9a3c9823a2e6a543eb7807fb3d15d8233817ec5 ("sched: Lower chances
    of cputime scaling overflow") which commit tried to avoid
    multiplication overflow, but did not guarantee that the overflow
    would not happen.
    
    Linus crated a different algorithm, which completely avoids the
    multiplication overflow by dropping precision when numbers are
    big.
    
    It was tested by me and it gives good relative error of
    scaled numbers. Testing method is described here:
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=136733059505406&w=2

commit 96fc7a7d42897d38d97e5f79c3f7a54c190f98c0
Author: Frederic Weisbecker <fweisbec@gmail.com>

    sched: Lower chances of cputime scaling overflow
    
    commit d9a3c9823a2e6a543eb7807fb3d15d8233817ec5 upstream.
    
    Some users have reported that after running a process with
    hundreds of threads on intensive CPU-bound loads, the cputime
    of the group started to freeze after a few days.
    
    This is due to how we scale the tick-based cputime against
    the scheduler precise execution time value.
    
    We add the values of all threads in the group and we multiply
    that against the sum of the scheduler exec runtime of the whole
    group.
    
    This easily overflows after a few days/weeks of execution.
    
    A proposed solution to solve this was to compute that multiplication
    on stime instead of utime:
       62188451f0d63add7ad0cd2a1ae269d600c1663d
       ("cputime: Avoid multiplication overflow on utime scaling")
    
    The rationale behind that was that it's easy for a thread to
    spend most of its time in userspace under intensive CPU-bound workload
    but it's much harder to do CPU-bound intensive long run in the kernel.
    
    This postulate got defeated when a user recently reported he was still
    seeing cputime freezes after the above patch. The workload that
    triggers this issue relates to intensive networking workloads where
    most of the cputime is consumed in the kernel.
    
    To reduce much more the opportunities for multiplication overflow,
    lets reduce the multiplication factors to the remainders of the division
    between sched exec runtime and cputime. Assuming the difference between
    these shouldn't ever be that large, it could work on many situations.
    
    This gets the same results as in the upstream scaling code except for
    a small difference: the upstream code always rounds the results to
    the nearest integer not greater to what would be the precise result.
    The new code rounds to the nearest integer either greater or not
    greater. In practice this difference probably shouldn't matter but
    it's worth mentioning.
    
    If this solution appears not to be enough in the end, we'll
    need to partly revert back to the behaviour prior to commit
         0cf55e1ec08bb5a22e068309e2d8ba1180ab4239
         ("sched, cputime: Introduce thread_group_times()")
    
    Back then, the scaling was done on exit() time before adding the cputime
    of an exiting thread to the signal struct. And then we'll need to
    scale one-by-one the live threads cputime in thread_group_cputime(). The
    drawback may be a slightly slower code on exit time.

    dm bufio: avoid a possible __vmalloc deadlock
    
    commit 502624bdad3dba45dfaacaf36b7d83e39e74b2d2 upstream.
    
    This patch uses memalloc_noio_save to avoid a possible deadlock in
    dm-bufio.  (it could happen only with large block size, at most
    PAGE_SIZE << MAX_ORDER (typically 8MiB).
    
    __vmalloc doesn't fully respect gfp flags. The specified gfp flags are
    used for allocation of requested pages, structures vmap_area, vmap_block
    and vm_struct and the radix tree nodes.
    
    However, the kernel pagetables are allocated always with GFP_KERNEL.
    Thus the allocation of pagetables can recurse back to the I/O layer and
    cause a deadlock.
    
    This patch uses the function memalloc_noio_save to set per-process
    PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO flag and the function memalloc_noio_restore to restore
    it. When this flag is set, all allocations in the process are done with
    implied GFP_NOIO flag, thus the deadlock can't happen.
    
    This should be backported to stable kernels, but they don't have the
    PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO flag and memalloc_noio_save/memalloc_noio_restore
    functions. So, PF_MEMALLOC should be set and restored instead.

    dm stripe: fix regression in stripe_width calculation
    
    commit d793e684277124d55c5d2444007e224635821346 upstream.
    
    Fix a regression in the calculation of the stripe_width in the
    dm stripe target which led to incorrect processing of device limits.
    
    The stripe_width is the stripe device length divided by the number of
    stripes.  The group of commits in the range f14fa69 ("dm stripe: fix
    size test") to eb850de ("dm stripe: support for non power of 2
    chunksize") interfered with each other (a merging error) and led to the
    stripe_width being set incorrectly to the stripe device length divided by
    chunk_size * stripe_count.
    
    For example, a stripe device's table with: 0 33553920 striped 3 512 ...
    should result in a stripe_width of 11184640 (33553920 / 3), but due to
    the bug it was getting set to 21845 (33553920 / (512 * 3)).
    
    The impact of this bug is that device topologies that previously worked
    fine with the stripe target are no longer considered valid.  In
    particular, there is a higher risk of seeing this issue if one of the
    stripe devices has a 4K logical block size.  Resulting in an error
    message like this:
    "device-mapper: table: 253:4: len=21845 not aligned to h/w logical block size 4096 of dm-1"
    
    The fix is to swap the order of the divisions and to use a temporary
    variable for the second one, so that width retains the intended
    value.

    ALSA: hda - Fix 3.9 regression of EAPD init on Conexant codecs
    
    commit ff359b14919c379a365233aa2e1dd469efac8ce8 upstream.
    
    The older Conexant codecs have up to two EAPDs and these are supposed
    to be rather statically turned on.  The new generic parser code
    assumes the dynamic on/off per path usage, thus it resulted in the
    silent output on some machines.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by simply assuming the static EAPD on for
    such old Conexant codecs as we did until 3.8 kernel.

    ALSA: HDA: Fix Oops caused by dereference NULL pointer
    
    commit 2195b063f6609e4c6268f291683902f25eaf9aa6 upstream.
    
    The interrupt handler azx_interrupt will call azx_update_rirb,
    which may call snd_hda_queue_unsol_event, snd_hda_queue_unsol_event
    will dereference chip->bus pointer.
    
    The problem is we alloc chip->bus in azx_codec_create
    which will be called after we enable IRQ and enable unsolicited
    event in azx_probe.
    
    This will cause Oops due dereference NULL pointer. I meet it, good luck:)

     NULL check of bus->workq -- tiwai]

    ARM: OMAP: RX-51: change probe order of touchscreen and panel SPI devices
    
    commit e65f131a14726e5f1b880a528271a52428e5b3a5 upstream.
    
    Commit 9fdca9df (spi: omap2-mcspi: convert to module_platform_driver)
    broke the SPI display/panel driver probe on RX-51/N900. The exact cause is
    not fully understood, but it seems to be related to the probe order. SPI
    communication to the panel driver (spi1.2) fails unless the touchscreen
    (spi1.0) has been probed/initialized before. When the omap2-mcspi driver
    was converted to a platform driver, it resulted in that the devices are
    probed immediately after the board registers them in the order they are
    listed in the board file.
    
    Fix the issue by moving the touchscreen before the panel in the SPI
    device list.
    
    The patch fixes the following failure:
    
    [    1.260955] acx565akm spi1.2: invalid display ID

    KVM: emulator: emulate SALC
    
    commit 326f578f7e1443bac2333712dd130a261ec15288 upstream.
    
    This is an almost-undocumented instruction available in 32-bit mode.
    I say "almost" undocumented because AMD documents it in their opcode
    maps just to say that it is unavailable in 64-bit mode (sections
    "A.2.1 One-Byte Opcodes" and "B.3 Invalid and Reassigned Instructions
    in 64-Bit Mode").
    
    It is roughly equivalent to "sbb %al, %al" except it does not
    set the flags.  Use fastop to emulate it, but do not use the opcode
    directly because it would fail if the host is 64-bit!

    The invalid guest state emulation loop does not check halt_request
    which causes 100% cpu loop while guest is in halt and in invalid
    state, but more serious issue is that this leaves halt_request set, so
    random instruction emulated by vm86 #GP exit can be interpreted
    as halt which causes guest hang. Fix both problems by handling
