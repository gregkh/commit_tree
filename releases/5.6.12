    mm/mremap: Add comment explaining the untagging behaviour of mremap()
    
    commit b2a84de2a2deb76a6a51609845341f508c518c03 upstream.
    
    Commit dcde237319e6 ("mm: Avoid creating virtual address aliases in
    brk()/mmap()/mremap()") changed mremap() so that only the 'old' address
    is untagged, leaving the 'new' address in the form it was passed from
    userspace. This prevents the unexpected creation of aliasing virtual
    mappings in userspace, but looks a bit odd when you read the code.
    
    Add a comment justifying the untagging behaviour in mremap().

    mac80211: add ieee80211_is_any_nullfunc()
    
    commit 30b2f0be23fb40e58d0ad2caf8702c2a44cda2e1 upstream.
    
    commit 08a5bdde3812 ("mac80211: consider QoS Null frames for STA_NULLFUNC_ACKED")
    Fixed a bug where we failed to take into account a
    nullfunc frame can be either non-QoS or QoS. It turns out
    there is at least one more bug in
    ieee80211_sta_tx_notify(), introduced in
    commit 7b6ddeaf27ec ("mac80211: use QoS NDP for AP probing"),
    where we forgot to check for the QoS variant and so
    assumed the QoS nullfunc frame never went out
    
    Fix this by adding a helper ieee80211_is_any_nullfunc()
    which consolidates the check for non-QoS and QoS nullfunc
    frames. Replace existing compound conditionals and add a
    couple more missing checks for QoS variant.

    ALSA: hda: Match both PCI ID and SSID for driver blacklist
    
    commit 977dfef40c8996b69afe23a9094d184049efb7bb upstream.
    
    The commit 3c6fd1f07ed0 ("ALSA: hda: Add driver blacklist") added a
    new blacklist for the devices that are known to have empty codecs, and
    one of the entries was ASUS ROG Zenith II (PCI SSID 1043:874f).
    However, it turned out that the very same PCI SSID is used for the
    previous model that does have the valid HD-audio codecs and the change
    broke the sound on it.
    
    Since the empty codec problem appear on the certain AMD platform (PCI
    ID 1022:1487), this patch changes the blacklist matching to both PCI
    ID and SSID using pci_match_id().  Also, the entry that was removed by
    the previous fix for ASUS ROG Zenigh II is re-added.

    When starting shutdown in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a(), get the value for
    SHUTDOWN Cumulative TSN Ack from the new association, which is
    reconstructed from the cookie, instead of the old association, which
    the peer doesn't have anymore.
    
    Otherwise the SHUTDOWN is either ignored or replied to with an ABORT
    by the peer because CTSN Ack doesn't match the peer's Initial TSN.

    tools/runqslower: Ensure own vmlinux.h is picked up first
    
    [ Upstream commit dfc55ace9939e1e8703ad37ddbba41aaa31cc0cb ]
    
    Reorder include paths to ensure that runqslower sources are picking up
    vmlinux.h, generated by runqslower's own Makefile. When runqslower is built
    from selftests/bpf, due to current -I$(BPF_INCLUDE) -I$(OUTPUT) ordering, it
    might pick up not-yet-complete vmlinux.h, generated by selftests Makefile,
    which could lead to compilation errors like [0]. So ensure that -I$(OUTPUT)
    goes first and rely on runqslower's Makefile own dependency chain to ensure
    vmlinux.h is properly completed before source code relying on it is compiled.

    net: systemport: suppress warnings on failed Rx SKB allocations
    
    [ Upstream commit 3554e54a46125030c534820c297ed7f6c3907e24 ]
    
    The driver is designed to drop Rx packets and reclaim the buffers
    when an allocation fails, and the network interface needs to safely
    handle this packet loss. Therefore, an allocation failure of Rx
    SKBs is relatively benign.
    
    However, the output of the warning message occurs with a high
    scheduling priority that can cause excessive jitter/latency for
    other high priority processing.
    
    This commit suppresses the warning messages to prevent scheduling
    problems while retaining the failure count in the statistics of
    the network interface.

    cifs: do not share tcons with DFS
    
    [ Upstream commit 65303de829dd6d291a4947c1a31de31896f8a060 ]
    
    This disables tcon re-use for DFS shares.
    
    tcon->dfs_path stores the path that the tcon should connect to when
    doing failing over.
    
    If that tcon is used multiple times e.g. 2 mounts using it with
    different prefixpath, each will need a different dfs_path but there is
    only one tcon. The other solution would be to split the tcon in 2
    tcons during failover but that is much harder.
    
    tcons could not be shared with DFS in cifs.ko because in a
    DFS namespace like:
    
              //domain/dfsroot -> /serverA/dfsroot, /serverB/dfsroot
    
              //serverA/dfsroot/link -> /serverA/target1/aa/bb
    
              //serverA/dfsroot/link2 -> /serverA/target1/cc/dd
    
    you can see that link and link2 are two DFS links that both resolve to
    the same target share (/serverA/target1), so cifs.ko will only contain a
    single tcon for both link and link2.
    
    The problem with that is, if we (auto)mount "link" and "link2", cifs.ko
    will only contain a single tcon for both DFS links so we couldn't
    perform failover or refresh the DFS cache for both links because
    tcon->dfs_path was set to either "link" or "link2", but not both --
    which is wrong.

    [ Upstream commit 54cb6221688660670a2e430892d7f4e6370263b8 ]
    
    Fix the rsnd_ssi_stop function to skip disabling the individual SSIs of

    was harmless, but caused a "status check failed" message to be printed
    for every SSI in the multi-SSI setup.
    The disabling of interrupts is still performed, as they are enabled for
    all SSIs in rsnd_ssi_init, but care is taken to not accidentally set the
    EN bit for an SSI where it was not set by rsnd_ssi_start.

    ASoC: rsnd: Don't treat master SSI in multi SSI setup as parent
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c258657ddfe81b4fc0183378d800c97ba0b7cdd ]
    
    The master SSI of a multi-SSI setup was attached both to the
    RSND_MOD_SSI slot and the RSND_MOD_SSIP slot of the rsnd_dai_stream.
    This is not correct wrt. the meaning of being "parent" in the rest of
    the SSI code, where it seems to indicate an SSI that provides clock and
    word sync but is not transmitting/receiving audio data.
    
    Not treating the multi-SSI master as parent allows removal of various
    special cases to the rsnd_ssi_is_parent conditions introduced in commit
    a09fb3f28a60 ("ASoC: rsnd: Fix parent SSI start/stop in multi-SSI mode").
    It also fixes the issue that operations performed via rsnd_dai_call()
    were performed twice for the master SSI. This caused some "status check
    failed" spam when stopping a multi-SSI stream as the driver attempted to
    stop the master SSI twice.

    net: stmmac: Fix sub-second increment
    
    [ Upstream commit 91a2559c1dc5b0f7e1256d42b1508935e8eabfbf ]
    
    In fine adjustement mode, which is the current default, the sub-second
        increment register is the number of nanoseconds that will be added to
        the clock when the accumulator overflows. At each clock cycle, the
        value of the addend register is added to the accumulator.
        Currently, we use 20ns = 1e09ns / 50MHz as this value whatever the
        frequency of the ptp clock actually is.
        The adjustment is then done on the addend register, only incrementing
        every X clock cycles X being the ratio between 50MHz and ptp_clock_rate
        (addend = 2^32 * 50MHz/ptp_clock_rate).
        This causes the following issues :
        - In case the frequency of the ptp clock is inferior or equal to 50MHz,
          the addend value calculation will overflow and the default
          addend value will be set to 0, causing the clock to not work at
          all. (For instance, for ptp_clock_rate = 50MHz, addend = 2^32).
        - The resolution of the timestamping clock is limited to 20ns while it
          is not needed, thus limiting the accuracy of the timestamping to
          20ns.
    
        Fix this by setting sub-second increment to 2e09ns / ptp_clock_rate.
        It will allow to reach the minimum possible frequency for
        ptp_clk_ref, which is 5MHz for GMII 1000Mps Full-Duplex by setting the
        sub-second-increment to a higher value. For instance, for 25MHz, it
        gives ssinc = 80ns and default_addend = 2^31.
        It will also allow to use a lower value for sub-second-increment, thus
        improving the timestamping accuracy with frequencies higher than
        100MHz, for instance, for 200MHz, ssinc = 10ns and default_addend =
        2^31.
    
    v1->v2:
     - Remove modifications to the calculation of default addend, which broke
     compatibility with clock frequencies for which 2000000000 / ptp_clk_freq
     is not an integer.
     - Modify description according to discussions.

    net: stmmac: fix enabling socfpga's ptp_ref_clock
    
    [ Upstream commit 15ce30609d1e88d42fb1cd948f453e6d5f188249 ]
    
    There are 2 registers to write to enable a ptp ref clock coming from the
    fpga.
    One that enables the usage of the clock from the fpga for emac0 and emac1
    as a ptp ref clock, and the other to allow signals from the fpga to reach
    emac0 and emac1.
    Currently, if the dwmac-socfpga has phymode set to PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_MII,
    PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_GMII, or PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_SGMII, both registers will
    be written and the ptp ref clock will be set as coming from the fpga.
    Separate the 2 register writes to only enable signals from the fpga to
    reach emac0 or emac1 when ptp ref clock is not coming from the fpga.

    wimax/i2400m: Fix potential urb refcnt leak
    
    [ Upstream commit 7717cbec172c3554d470023b4020d5781961187e ]
    
    i2400mu_bus_bm_wait_for_ack() invokes usb_get_urb(), which increases the
    refcount of the "notif_urb".
    
    When i2400mu_bus_bm_wait_for_ack() returns, local variable "notif_urb"
    becomes invalid, so the refcount should be decreased to keep refcount
    balanced.
    
    The issue happens in all paths of i2400mu_bus_bm_wait_for_ack(), which
    forget to decrease the refcnt increased by usb_get_urb(), causing a
    refcnt leak.
    
    Fix this issue by calling usb_put_urb() before the
    i2400mu_bus_bm_wait_for_ack() returns.

    ASoC: rsnd: Fix HDMI channel mapping for multi-SSI mode
    
    [ Upstream commit b94e164759b82d0c1c80d4b1c8f12c9bee83f11d ]
    
    The HDMI?_SEL register maps up to four stereo SSI data lanes onto the
    sdata[0..3] inputs of the HDMI output block. The upper half of the
    register contains four blocks of 4 bits, with the most significant
    controlling the sdata3 line and the least significant the sdata0 line.
    
    The shift calculation has an off-by-one error, causing the parent SSI to
    be mapped to sdata3, the first multi-SSI child to sdata0 and so forth.
    As the parent SSI transmits the stereo L/R channels, and the HDMI core
    expects it on the sdata0 line, this causes no audio to be output when
    playing stereo audio on a multichannel capable HDMI out, and
    multichannel audio has permutated channels.
    
    Fix the shift calculation to map the parent SSI to sdata0, the first
    child to sdata1 etc.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Properly set maxpacket limit
    
    [ Upstream commit d94ea5319813658ad5861d161ae16a194c2abf88 ]
    
    Currently the calculation of max packet size limit for IN endpoints is
    too restrictive. This prevents a matching of a capable hardware endpoint
    during configuration. Below is the minimum recommended HW configuration
    to support a particular endpoint setup from the databook:
    
    For OUT endpoints, the databook recommended the minimum RxFIFO size to
    be at least 3x MaxPacketSize + 3x setup packets size (8 bytes each) +
    clock crossing margin (16 bytes).
    
    For IN endpoints, the databook recommended the minimum TxFIFO size to be
    at least 3x MaxPacketSize for endpoints that support burst. If the
    endpoint doesn't support burst or when the device is operating in USB
    2.0 mode, a minimum TxFIFO size of 2x MaxPacketSize is recommended.
    
    Base on these recommendations, we can calculate the MaxPacketSize limit
    of each endpoint. This patch revises the IN endpoint MaxPacketSize limit
    and also sets the MaxPacketSize limit for OUT endpoints.

    ASoC: sgtl5000: Fix VAG power-on handling
    
    [ Upstream commit aa7812737f2877e192d57626cbe8825cc7cf6de9 ]
    
    As mentioned slightly out of patch context in the code, there
    is no reset routine for the chip. On boards where the chip is
    supplied by a fixed regulator, it might not even be resetted
    during (e.g. watchdog) reboot and can be in any state.
    
    If the device is probed with VAG enabled, the driver's probe
    routine will generate a loud pop sound when ANA_POWER is
    being programmed. Avoid this by properly disabling just the
    VAG bit and waiting the required power down time.

    selftests/ipc: Fix test failure seen after initial test run
    
    [ Upstream commit b87080eab4c1377706c113fc9c0157f19ea8fed1 ]
    
    After successfully running the IPC msgque test once, subsequent runs
    result in a test failure:
    
      $ sudo ./run_kselftest.sh
      TAP version 13
      1..1
      # selftests: ipc: msgque
      # Failed to get stats for IPC queue with id 0
      # Failed to dump queue: -22
      # Bail out!
      # # Pass 0 Fail 0 Xfail 0 Xpass 0 Skip 0 Error 0
      not ok 1 selftests: ipc: msgque # exit=1
    
    The dump_queue() function loops through the possible message queue index
    values using calls to msgctl(kern_id, MSG_STAT, ...) where kern_id
    represents the index value. The first time the test is ran, the initial
    index value of 0 is valid and the test is able to complete. The index
    value of 0 is not valid in subsequent test runs and the loop attempts to
    try index values of 1, 2, 3, and so on until a valid index value is
    found that corresponds to the message queue created earlier in the test.
    
    The msgctl() syscall returns -1 and sets errno to EINVAL when invalid
    index values are used. The test failure is caused by incorrectly
    comparing errno to -EINVAL when cycling through possible index values.
    
    Fix invalid test failures on subsequent runs of the msgque test by
    correctly comparing errno values to a non-negated EINVAL.

    [ Upstream commit 24c3f063c57b2a8ae21b259bcfa7690e2eb56dd9 ]
    
    Independent builds of the vm selftests is currently broken because
    commit 7549b3364201 ("selftests: vm: Build/Run 64bit tests only on

    uname. This does not always match the architecture names used for
    tasks like header installation.

    and not ARCH=ppc64 or ARCH=ppc64le. Otherwise, the build
    fails as shown below.

    cache_purge can walk to a deleted entry and tries to double free it.

    drm/bridge: analogix_dp: Split bind() into probe() and real bind()
    
    [ Upstream commit 83a196773b8bc6702f49df1eddc848180e350340 ]
    
    Analogix_dp driver acquires all its resources in the ->bind() callback,
    what is a bit against the component driver based approach, where the
    driver initialization is split into a probe(), where all resources are
    gathered, and a bind(), where all objects are created and a compound
    driver is initialized.
    
    Extract all the resource related operations to analogix_dp_probe() and
    analogix_dp_remove(), then call them before/after registration of the
    device components from the main Exynos DP and Rockchip DP drivers. Also
    move the plat_data initialization to the probe() to make it available for
    the analogix_dp_probe() function.
    
    This fixes the multiple calls to the bind() of the DRM compound driver
    when the DP PHY driver is not yet loaded/probed:

    The abnormal flow looks like:
    host-userspace           vhost vsock                       guest vsock
    ==============           ===========                       ============
    connect()     -------->  vhost_transport_send_pkt_work()   initializing
       |                     vq->private_data==NULL
       |                     will not be queued
       V
    schedule_timeout(2s)
                             vhost_vsock_start()  <---------   device ready
                             set vq->private_data
    
    wait for 2s and failed
    connect() again          vq->private_data!=NULL         recv connecting pkt
    
    Details:
    1. Host userspace sends a connect pkt, at that time, guest vsock is under
       initializing, hence the vhost_vsock_start has not been called. So
       vq->private_data==NULL, and the pkt is not been queued to send to guest
    2. Then it sleeps for 2s
    3. After guest vsock finishes initializing, vq->private_data is set
    4. When host userspace wakes up after 2s, send connecting pkt again,
       everything is fine.
    
    As suggested by Stefano Garzarella, this fixes it by additional kicking the
    send_pkt worker in vhost_vsock_start once the virtio device is started. This
    makes the pending pkt sent again.
    
    After this patch, kata-runtime (with vsock enabled) boot time is reduced
    from 3s to 1s on a ThunderX2 arm64 server.
