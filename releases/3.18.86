    drm/i915: Prevent zero length "index" write
    
    commit 56350fb8978bbf4aafe08f21234e161dd128b417 upstream.
    
    The hardware always writes one or two bytes in the index portion of
    an indexed transfer. Make sure the message we send as the index
    doesn't have a zero length.

    NFS: revalidate "." etc correctly on "open".
    
    commit b688741cb06695312f18b730653d6611e1bad28d upstream.
    
    For correct close-to-open semantics, NFS must validate
    the change attribute of a directory (or file) on open.
    
    Since commit ecf3d1f1aa74 ("vfs: kill FS_REVAL_DOT by adding a
    d_weak_revalidate dentry op"), open() of "." or a path ending ".." is
    not revalidated reliably (except when that direct is a mount point).
    
    Prior to that commit, "." was revalidated using nfs_lookup_revalidate()
    which checks the LOOKUP_OPEN flag and forces revalidation if the flag is
    set.
    Since that commit, nfs_weak_revalidate() is used for NFSv3 (which
    ignores the flags) and nothing is used for NFSv4.
    
    This is fixed by using nfs_lookup_verify_inode() in
    nfs_weak_revalidate().  This does the revalidation exactly when needed.
    Also, add a definition of .d_weak_revalidate for NFSv4.
    
    The incorrect behavior is easily demonstrated by running "echo *" in
    some non-mountpoint NFS directory while watching network traffic.
    Without this patch, "echo *" sometimes doesn't produce any traffic.
    With the patch it always does.

    KVM: x86: inject exceptions produced by x86_decode_insn
    
    commit 6ea6e84309ca7e0e850b3083e6b09344ee15c290 upstream.
    
    Sometimes, a processor might execute an instruction while another
    processor is updating the page tables for that instruction's code page,
    but before the TLB shootdown completes.  The interesting case happens
    if the page is in the TLB.
    
    In general, the processor will succeed in executing the instruction and
    nothing bad happens.  However, what if the instruction is an MMIO access?
    If *that* happens, KVM invokes the emulator, and the emulator gets the
    updated page tables.  If the update side had marked the code page as non
    present, the page table walk then will fail and so will x86_decode_insn.
    
    Unfortunately, even though kvm_fetch_guest_virt is correctly returning
    X86EMUL_PROPAGATE_FAULT, x86_decode_insn's caller treats the failure as
    a fatal error if the instruction cannot simply be reexecuted (as is the
    case for MMIO).  And this in fact happened sometimes when rebooting
    Windows 2012r2 guests.  Just checking ctxt->have_exception and injecting
    the exception if true is enough to fix the case.
    
    Thanks to Eduardo Habkost for helping in the debugging of this issue.

    KVM: x86: Exit to user-mode on #UD intercept when emulator requires
    
    commit 61cb57c9ed631c95b54f8e9090c89d18b3695b3c upstream.
    
    Instruction emulation after trapping a #UD exception can result in an
    MMIO access, for example when emulating a MOVBE on a processor that
    doesn't support the instruction.  In this case, the #UD vmexit handler
    must exit to user mode, but there wasn't any code to do so.  Add it for
    both VMX and SVM.

    btrfs: clear space cache inode generation always
    
    commit 8e138e0d92c6c9d3d481674fb14e3439b495be37 upstream.
    
    We discovered a box that had double allocations, and suspected the space
    cache may be to blame.  While auditing the write out path I noticed that
    if we've already setup the space cache we will just carry on.  This
    means that any error we hit after cache_save_setup before we go to
    actually write the cache out we won't reset the inode generation, so
    whatever was already written will be considered correct, except it'll be
    stale.  Fix this by _always_ resetting the generation on the block group
    inode, this way we only ever have valid or invalid cache.
    
    With this patch I was no longer able to reproduce cache corruption with
    dm-log-writes and my bpf error injection tool.

    mm/madvise.c: fix madvise() infinite loop under special circumstances
    
    commit 6ea8d958a2c95a1d514015d4e29ba21a8c0a1a91 upstream.
    
    MADVISE_WILLNEED has always been a noop for DAX (formerly XIP) mappings.
    Unfortunately madvise_willneed() doesn't communicate this information
    properly to the generic madvise syscall implementation.  The calling
    convention is quite subtle there.  madvise_vma() is supposed to either
    return an error or update &prev otherwise the main loop will never
    advance to the next vma and it will keep looping for ever without a way
    to get out of the kernel.
    
    It seems this has been broken since introduction.  Nobody has noticed
    because nobody seems to be using MADVISE_WILLNEED on these DAX mappings.

    mm, thp: Do not make page table dirty unconditionally in touch_p[mu]d()
    
    commit a8f97366452ed491d13cf1e44241bc0b5740b1f0 upstream.
    
    Currently, we unconditionally make page table dirty in touch_pmd().
    It may result in false-positive can_follow_write_pmd().
    
    We may avoid the situation, if we would only make the page table entry
    dirty if caller asks for write access -- FOLL_WRITE.
    
    The patch also changes touch_pud() in the same way.

    ipsec: Fix aborted xfrm policy dump crash
    
    commit 1137b5e2529a8f5ca8ee709288ecba3e68044df2 upstream.
    
    An independent security researcher, Mohamed Ghannam, has reported
    this vulnerability to Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure
    program.
    
    The xfrm_dump_policy_done function expects xfrm_dump_policy to
    have been called at least once or it will crash.  This can be
    triggered if a dump fails because the target socket's receive
    buffer is full.
    
    This patch fixes it by using the cb->start mechanism to ensure that
    the initialisation is always done regardless of the buffer situation.
