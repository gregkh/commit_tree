    net: sfp: add workaround for Realtek RTL8672 and RTL9601C chips
    
    [ Upstream commit 426c6cbc409cbda9ab1a9dbf15d3c2ef947eb8c1 ]
    
    The workaround for VSOL V2801F brand based GPON SFP modules added in commit
    0d035bed2a4a ("net: sfp: VSOL V2801F / CarlitoxxPro CPGOS03-0490 v2.0
    workaround") works only for IDs added explicitly to the list. Since there
    are rebranded modules where OEM vendors put different strings into the
    vendor name field, we cannot base workaround on IDs only.
    
    Moreover the issue which the above mentioned commit tried to work around is
    generic not only to VSOL based modules, but rather to all GPON modules
    based on Realtek RTL8672 and RTL9601C chips.
    
    These include at least the following GPON modules:
    * V-SOL V2801F
    * C-Data FD511GX-RM0
    * OPTON GP801R
    * BAUDCOM BD-1234-SFM
    * CPGOS03-0490 v2.0
    * Ubiquiti U-Fiber Instant
    * EXOT EGS1
    
    These Realtek chips have broken EEPROM emulator which for N-byte read
    operation returns just the first byte of EEPROM data, followed by N-1
    zeros.
    
    Introduce a new function, sfp_id_needs_byte_io(), which detects SFP modules
    with broken EEPROM emulator based on N-1 zeros and switch to 1 byte EEPROM
    reading operation.
    
    Function sfp_i2c_read() now always uses single byte reading when it is
    required and when function sfp_hwmon_probe() detects single byte access,
    it disables registration of hwmon device, because in this case we cannot
    reliably and atomically read 2 bytes as is required by the standard for
    retrieving values from diagnostic area.
    
    (These Realtek chips are broken in a way that violates SFP standards for
    diagnostic interface. Kernel in this case simply cannot do anything less
    of skipping registration of the hwmon interface.)
    
    This patch fixes reading of EEPROM content from SFP modules based on
    Realtek RTL8672 and RTL9601C chips. Diagnostic interface of EEPROM stays
    broken and cannot be fixed.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Add quirk for Intel NUC 10
    
    commit 73e7161eab5dee98114987239ec9c87fe8034ddb upstream.
    
    This adds a new SND_PCI_QUIRK(...) and applies it to the Intel NUC 10
    devices. This fixes the issue of the devices not having audio input and
    output on the headset jack because the kernel does not recognize when
    something is plugged in.
    
    The new quirk was inspired by the quirk for the Intel NUC 8 devices, but
    it turned out that the NUC 10 uses another pin. This information was
    acquired by black box testing likely pins.

    tty: teach the n_tty ICANON case about the new "cookie continuations" too
    
    commit d7fe75cbc23c7d225eee2ef04def239b6603dce7 upstream.
    
    The ICANON case is a bit messy, since it has to look for the line
    ending, and has special code to then suppress line ending characters if
    they match the __DISABLED_CHAR.  So it actually looks up the line ending
    even past the point where it knows it won't copy it to the result
    buffer.
    
    That said, apart from all those odd legacy N_TTY ICANON cases, the
    actual "should we continue copying" logic isn't really all that
    complicated or different from the non-canon case.  In fact, the lack of
    "wait for at least N characters" arguably makes the repeat case slightly
    simpler.  It really just boils down to "there's more of the line to be
    copied".
    
    So add the necessarily trivial logic, and now the N_TTY case will give
    long result lines even when in canon mode.

    tty: teach n_tty line discipline about the new "cookie continuations"
    
    commit 15ea8ae8e03fdb845ed3ff5d9f11dd5f4f60252c upstream.
    
    With the conversion to do the tty ldisc read operations in small chunks,
    the n_tty line discipline became noticeably slower for throughput
    oriented loads, because rather than read things in up to 2kB chunks, it
    would return at most 64 bytes per read() system call.
    
    The cost is mainly all in the "do system calls over and over", not
    really in the new "copy to an extra kernel buffer".
    
    This can be fixed by teaching the n_tty line discipline about the
    "cookie continuation" model, which the chunking code supports because
    things like hdlc need to be able to handle packets up to 64kB in size.
    
    Doing that doesn't just get us back to the old performace, but to much
    better performance: my stupid "copy 10MB of data over a pty" test
    program is now almost twice as fast as it used to be (going down from
    0.1s to 0.054s).
    
    This is entirely because it now creates maximal chunks (which happens to
    be "one byte less than one page" due to how we do the circular tty
    buffers).
    
    NOTE! This case only handles the simpler non-icanon case, which is the
    one where people may care about throughput.  I'm going to do the icanon
    case later too, because while performance isn't a major issue for that,
    there may be programs that think they'll always get a full line and
    don't like the 64-byte chunking for that reason.
    
    Such programs are arguably buggy (signals etc can cause random partial
    results from tty reads anyway), and good programs will handle such
    partial reads, but expecting everybody to write "good programs" has
    never been a winning policy for the kernel..

    commit 64a69892afadd6fffaeadc65427bb7601161139d upstream.
    
    Back when the line disciplines did their own direct user accesses, they
    had to deal with the data copy possibly failing in the middle.
    
    Now that the user copy is done by the tty_io.c code, that failure case
    no longer exists.

    tty: fix up iterate_tty_read() EOVERFLOW handling
    
    commit e71a8d5cf4b4f274740e31b601216071e2a11afa upstream.
    
    When I converted the tty_ldisc_ops 'read()' function to take a kernel
    pointer, I was a bit too aggressive about the ldisc returning EOVERFLOW.
    
    Yes, we want to have EOVERFLOW override any partially read data (because
    the whole point is that the buffer was too small for the whole packet,
    and we don't want to see partial packets), but it shouldn't override a
    previous EFAULT.
    
    And in fact, it really is just EOVERFLOW that is special and should
    throw away any partially read data, not "any error".  Admittedly
    EOVERFLOW is currently the only one that can happen for a continuation
    read - and if the first read iteration returns an error we won't have this issue.
    
    So this is more of a technicality, but let's just make the intent very
    explicit, and re-organize the error handling a bit so that this is all
    clearer.

    zsmalloc: account the number of compacted pages correctly
    
    commit 2395928158059b8f9858365fce7713ce7fef62e4 upstream.
    
    There exists multiple path may do zram compaction concurrently.
    1. auto-compaction triggered during memory reclaim
    2. userspace utils write zram<id>/compaction node
    
    So, multiple threads may call zs_shrinker_scan/zs_compact concurrently.
    But pages_compacted is a per zsmalloc pool variable and modification
    of the variable is not serialized(through under class->lock).
    There are two issues here:
    1. the pages_compacted may not equal to total number of pages
    freed(due to concurrently add).
    2. zs_shrinker_scan may not return the correct number of pages
    freed(issued by current shrinker).
    
    The fix is simple:
    1. account the number of pages freed in zs_compact locally.
    2. use actomic variable pages_compacted to accumulate total number.

    xen: fix p2m size in dom0 for disabled memory hotplug case
    
    commit 882213990d32fd224340a4533f6318dd152be4b2 upstream.
    
    Since commit 9e2369c06c8a18 ("xen: add helpers to allocate unpopulated
    memory") foreign mappings are using guest physical addresses allocated
    via ZONE_DEVICE functionality.
    
    This will result in problems for the case of no balloon memory hotplug
    being configured, as the p2m list will only cover the initial memory
    size of the domain. Any ZONE_DEVICE allocated address will be outside
    the p2m range and thus a mapping can't be established with that memory
    address.
    
    Fix that by extending the p2m size for that case. At the same time add
    a check for a to be created mapping to be within the p2m limits in
    order to detect errors early.
    
    While changing a comment, remove some 32-bit leftovers.
    
    This is XSA-369.

    Xen/gnttab: handle p2m update errors on a per-slot basis
    
    commit 8310b77b48c5558c140e7a57a702e7819e62f04e upstream.
    
    Bailing immediately from set_foreign_p2m_mapping() upon a p2m updating
    error leaves the full batch in an ambiguous state as far as the caller
    is concerned. Instead flags respective slots as bad, unmapping what
    was mapped there right away.
    
    HYPERVISOR_grant_table_op()'s return value and the individual unmap
    slots' status fields get used only for a one-time - there's not much we
    can do in case of a failure.
    
    Note that there's no GNTST_enomem or alike, so GNTST_general_error gets
    used.
    
    The map ops' handle fields get overwritten just to be on the safe side.
    
    This is part of XSA-367.

    sched/features: Fix hrtick reprogramming
    
    [ Upstream commit 156ec6f42b8d300dbbf382738ff35c8bad8f4c3a ]
    
    Hung tasks and RCU stall cases were reported on systems which were not
    100% busy. Investigation of such unexpected cases (no sign of potential
    starvation caused by tasks hogging the system) pointed out that the
    periodic sched tick timer wasn't serviced anymore after a certain point
    and that caused all machinery that depends on it (timers, RCU, etc.) to
    stop working as well. This issues was however only reproducible if
    HRTICK was enabled.
    
    Looking at core dumps it was found that the rbtree of the hrtimer base
    used also for the hrtick was corrupted (i.e. next as seen from the base
    root and actual leftmost obtained by traversing the tree are different).
    Same base is also used for periodic tick hrtimer, which might get "lost"
    if the rbtree gets corrupted.
    
    Much alike what described in commit 1f71addd34f4c ("tick/sched: Do not
    mess with an enqueued hrtimer") there is a race window between
    hrtimer_set_expires() in hrtick_start and hrtimer_start_expires() in
    __hrtick_restart() in which the former might be operating on an already
    queued hrtick hrtimer, which might lead to corruption of the base.
    
    Use hrtick_start() (which removes the timer before enqueuing it back) to
    ensure hrtick hrtimer reprogramming is entirely guarded by the base
    lock, so that no race conditions can occur.

    btrfs: fix error handling in commit_fs_roots
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f4317c13a40194940acf4a71670179c4faca2b5 ]
    
    While doing error injection I would sometimes get a corrupt file system.
    This is because I was injecting errors at btrfs_search_slot, but would
    only do it one time per stack.  This uncovered a problem in
    commit_fs_roots, where if we get an error we would just break.  However
    we're in a nested loop, the first loop being a loop to find all the
    dirty fs roots, and then subsequent root updates would succeed clearing
    the error value.
    
    This isn't likely to happen in real scenarios, however we could
    potentially get a random ENOMEM once and then not again, and we'd end up
    with a corrupted file system.  Fix this by moving the error checking
    around a bit to the main loop, as this is the only place where something
    will fail, and return the error as soon as it occurs.
    
    With this patch my reproducer no longer corrupts the file system.

    ASoC: Intel: Add DMI quirk table to soc_intel_is_byt_cr()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ade6d8b02b1ead741bd4f6c42921035caab6560 ]
    
    Some Bay Trail systems:
    1. Use a non CR version of the Bay Trail SoC
    2. Contain at least 6 interrupt resources so that the
       platform_get_resource(pdev, IORESOURCE_IRQ, 5) check to workaround
       non CR systems which list their IPC IRQ at index 0 despite being
       non CR does not work
    3. Despite 1. and 2. still have their IPC IRQ at index 0 rather then 5
    
    Add a DMI quirk table to check for the few known models with this issue,
    so that the right IPC IRQ index is used on these systems.

    [Why]
    If the BIOS table is invalid or corrupt then get_i2c_info can fail
    and we dereference a NULL pointer.
    
    [How]
    Check that ddc_pin is not NULL before using it and log an error if it
    is because this is unexpected.

    drm/amdgpu: Add check to prevent IH overflow
    
    [ Upstream commit e4180c4253f3f2da09047f5139959227f5cf1173 ]
    
    Similar to commit <b82175750131>("drm/amdgpu: fix IH overflow on Vega10 v2").
    When an ring buffer overflow happens the appropriate bit is set in the WPTR
    register which is also written back to memory. But clearing the bit in the
    WPTR doesn't trigger another memory writeback.
    
    So what can happen is that we end up processing the buffer overflow over and
    over again because the bit is never cleared. Resulting in a random system
    lockup because of an infinite loop in an interrupt handler.

    fs: make unlazy_walk() error handling consistent
    
    [ Upstream commit e36cffed20a324e116f329a94061ae30dd26fb51 ]
    
    Most callers check for non-zero return, and assume it's -ECHILD (which
    it always will be). One caller uses the actual error return. Clean this
    up and make it fully consistent, by having unlazy_walk() return a bool
    instead. Rename it to try_to_unlazy() and return true on success, and
    failure on error. That's easier to read.
    
    No functional changes in this patch.

    crypto: tcrypt - avoid signed overflow in byte count
    
    [ Upstream commit 303fd3e1c771077e32e96e5788817f025f0067e2 ]
    
    The signed long type used for printing the number of bytes processed in
    tcrypt benchmarks limits the range to -/+ 2 GiB, which is not sufficient
    to cover the performance of common accelerated ciphers such as AES-NI
    when benchmarked with sec=1. So switch to u64 instead.
    
    While at it, fix up a missing printk->pr_cont conversion in the AEAD
    benchmark.

    brcmfmac: Add DMI nvram filename quirk for Voyo winpad A15 tablet
    
    [ Upstream commit a338c874d3d9d2463f031e89ae14942929b93db6 ]
    
    The Voyo winpad A15 tablet contains quite generic names in the sys_vendor
    and product_name DMI strings, without this patch brcmfmac will try to load:
    rcmfmac4330-sdio.To be filled by O.E.M.-To be filled by O.E.M..txt
    as nvram file which is a bit too generic.
    
    Add a DMI quirk so that a unique and clearly identifiable nvram file name
    is used on the Voyo winpad A15 tablet.
    
    While preparing a matching linux-firmware update I noticed that the nvram
    is identical to the nvram used on the Prowise-PT301 tablet, so the new DMI
    quirk entry simply points to the already existing Prowise-PT301 nvram file.

    Bluetooth: Add new HCI_QUIRK_NO_SUSPEND_NOTIFIER quirk
    
    [ Upstream commit 219991e6be7f4a31d471611e265b72f75b2d0538 ]
    
    Some devices, e.g. the RTL8723BS bluetooth part, some USB attached devices,
    completely drop from the bus on a system-suspend. These devices will
    have their driver unbound and rebound on resume (when the dropping of
    the bus gets detected) and will show up as a new HCI after resume.
    
    These devices do not benefit from the suspend / resume handling work done
    by the hci_suspend_notifier. At best this unnecessarily adds some time to
    the suspend/resume time. But this may also actually cause problems, if the
    code doing the driver unbinding runs after the pm-notifier then the
    hci_suspend_notifier code will try to talk to a device which is now in
    an uninitialized state.
    
    This commit adds a new HCI_QUIRK_NO_SUSPEND_NOTIFIER quirk which allows
    drivers to opt-out of the hci_suspend_notifier when they know beforehand
    that their device will be fully re-initialized / reprobed on resume.

    net: sfp: add mode quirk for GPON module Ubiquiti U-Fiber Instant
    
    [ Upstream commit f0b4f847673299577c29b71d3f3acd3c313d81b7 ]
    
    The Ubiquiti U-Fiber Instant SFP GPON module has nonsensical information
    stored in its EEPROM. It claims to support all transceiver types including
    10G Ethernet. Clear all claimed modes and set only 1000baseX_Full, which is
    the only one supported.
    
    This module has also phys_id set to SFF, and the SFP subsystem currently
    does not allow to use SFP modules detected as SFFs. Add exception for this
    module so it can be detected as supported.
    
    This change finally allows to detect and use SFP GPON module Ubiquiti
    U-Fiber Instant on Linux system.
    
    EEPROM content of this SFP module is (where XX is serial number):

    ath10k: fix wmi mgmt tx queue full due to race condition
    
    [ Upstream commit b55379e343a3472c35f4a1245906db5158cab453 ]
    
    Failed to transmit wmi management frames:
    
    [84977.840894] ath10k_snoc a000000.wifi: wmi mgmt tx queue is full
    [84977.840913] ath10k_snoc a000000.wifi: failed to transmit packet, dropping: -28
    [84977.840924] ath10k_snoc a000000.wifi: failed to submit frame: -28
    [84977.840932] ath10k_snoc a000000.wifi: failed to transmit frame: -28
    
    This issue is caused by race condition between skb_dequeue and
    __skb_queue_tail. The queue of ‘wmi_mgmt_tx_queue’ is protected by a
    different lock: ar->data_lock vs list->lock, the result is no protection.
    So when ath10k_mgmt_over_wmi_tx_work() and ath10k_mac_tx_wmi_mgmt()
    running concurrently on different CPUs, there appear to be a rare corner
    cases when the queue length is 1,
    
      CPUx (skb_deuque)                     CPUy (__skb_queue_tail)
                                            next=list
                                            prev=list
      struct sk_buff *skb = skb_peek(list); WRITE_ONCE(newsk->next, next);
      WRITE_ONCE(list->qlen, list->qlen - 1);WRITE_ONCE(newsk->prev, prev);
      next       = skb->next;               WRITE_ONCE(next->prev, newsk);
      prev       = skb->prev;               WRITE_ONCE(prev->next, newsk);
      skb->next  = skb->prev = NULL;        list->qlen++;
      WRITE_ONCE(next->prev, prev);
      WRITE_ONCE(prev->next, next);
    
    If the instruction ‘next = skb->next’ is executed before
    ‘WRITE_ONCE(prev->next, newsk)’, newsk will be lost, as CPUx get the
    old ‘next’ pointer, but the length is still added by one. The final
    result is the length of the queue will reach the maximum value but
    the queue is empty.
    
    So remove ar->data_lock, and use 'skb_queue_tail' instead of
    '__skb_queue_tail' to prevent the potential race condition. Also switch
    to use skb_queue_len_lockless, in case we queue a few SKBs simultaneously.

    [ Upstream commit 275b1e88cabb34dbcbe99756b67e9939d34a99b6 ]
    
    pktgen create threads for all online cpus and bond these threads to
    relevant cpu repecivtily. when this thread firstly be woken up, it
    will compare cpu currently running with the cpu specified at the time
    of creation and if the two cpus are not equal, BUG_ON() will take effect
    causing panic on the system.
    Notice that these threads could be migrated to other cpus before start
    running because of the cpu hotplug after these threads have created. so the
    BUG_ON() used here seems unreasonable and we can replace it with WARN_ON()
    to just printf a warning other than panic the system.

    wlcore: Fix command execute failure 19 for wl12xx
    
    [ Upstream commit cb88d01b67383a095e3f7caeb4cdade5a6cf0417 ]
    
    We can currently get a "command execute failure 19" error on beacon loss
    if the signal is weak:
    
    wlcore: Beacon loss detected. roles:0xff
    wlcore: Connection loss work (role_id: 0).
    ...
    wlcore: ERROR command execute failure 19
    ...
    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1552 at drivers/net/wireless/ti/wlcore/main.c:803
    ...
    (wl12xx_queue_recovery_work.part.0 [wlcore])
    (wl12xx_cmd_role_start_sta [wlcore])
    (wl1271_op_bss_info_changed [wlcore])
    (ieee80211_prep_connection [mac80211])
    
    Error 19 is defined as CMD_STATUS_WRONG_NESTING from the wlcore firmware,
    and seems to mean that the firmware no longer wants to see the quirk
    handling for WLCORE_QUIRK_START_STA_FAILS done.
    
    This quirk got added with commit 18eab430700d ("wlcore: workaround
    start_sta problem in wl12xx fw"), and it seems that this already got fixed
    in the firmware long time ago back in 2012 as wl18xx never had this quirk
    in place to start with.
    
    As we no longer even support firmware that early, to me it seems that it's
    safe to just drop WLCORE_QUIRK_START_STA_FAILS to fix the error. Looks
    like earlier firmware got disabled back in 2013 with commit 0e284c074ef9
    ("wl12xx: increase minimum singlerole firmware version required").
    
    If it turns out we still need WLCORE_QUIRK_START_STA_FAILS with any
    firmware that the driver works with, we can simply revert this patch and
    add extra checks for firmware version used.
    
    With this fix wlcore reconnects properly after a beacon loss.

    The constant 20 makes the font sum computation signed which can lead to
    sign extensions and signed wraps. It's not much of a problem as we build
    with -fno-strict-overflow. But if we ever decide not to, be ready, so
    switch the constant to unsigned.

    On this system the M.2 PCIe WiFi card isn't detected after reboot, only
    after cold boot. reboot=pci fixes this behavior. In [0] the same issue
    is described, although on another system and with another Intel WiFi
    card. In case it's relevant, both systems have Celeron CPUs.
    
    Add a PCI reboot quirk on affected systems until a more generic fix is

    Those were only laptops and are very very unlikely to have ECC memory.
    Currently, when the driver attempts to load, it issues:
    
      EDAC amd64: Error: F1 not found: device 0x1601 (broken BIOS?)
    
    because the PCI device is the wrong one (it uses the F15h default one).
    
    So do not load the driver on them as that is pointless.

    rsi: Move card interrupt handling to RX thread
    
    [ Upstream commit 287431463e786766e05e4dc26d0a11d5f8ac8815 ]
    
    The interrupt handling of the RS911x is particularly heavy. For each RX
    packet, the card does three SDIO transactions, one to read interrupt
    status register, one to RX buffer length, one to read the RX packet(s).
    This translates to ~330 uS per one cycle of interrupt handler. In case
    there is more incoming traffic, this will be more.
    
    The drivers/mmc/core/sdio_irq.c has the following comment, quote "Just
    like traditional hard IRQ handlers, we expect SDIO IRQ handlers to be
    quick and to the point, so that the holding of the host lock does not
    cover too much work that doesn't require that lock to be held."
    
    The RS911x interrupt handler does not fit that. This patch therefore
    changes it such that the entire IRQ handler is moved to the RX thread
    instead, and the interrupt handler only wakes the RX thread.
    
    This is OK, because the interrupt handler only does things which can
    also be done in the RX thread, that is, it checks for firmware loading
    error(s), it checks buffer status, it checks whether a packet arrived
    and if so, reads out the packet and passes it to network stack.
    
    Moreover, this change permits removal of a code which allocated an
    skbuff only to get 4-byte-aligned buffer, read up to 8kiB of data
    into the skbuff, queue this skbuff into local private queue, then in
    RX thread, this buffer is dequeued, the data in the skbuff as passed
    to the RSI driver core, and the skbuff is deallocated. All this is
    replaced by directly calling the RSI driver core with local buffer.

    The problem is that the TX EAPOL data descriptor RSI_DESC_REQUIRE_CFM_TO_HOST
    flag and extended descriptor EAPOL4_CONFIRM frame type are not set in case the
    AP is iwlwifi, because in that case the TX EAPOL packet is 2 bytes shorter.
    
    The downstream vendor driver has this change in place already [1], however
    there is no explanation for it, neither is there any commit history from which
    such explanation could be obtained.

    net: fix dev_ifsioc_locked() race condition
    
    commit 3b23a32a63219f51a5298bc55a65ecee866e79d0 upstream.
    
    dev_ifsioc_locked() is called with only RCU read lock, so when
    there is a parallel writer changing the mac address, it could
    get a partially updated mac address, as shown below:
    
    Thread 1                        Thread 2
    // eth_commit_mac_addr_change()
    memcpy(dev->dev_addr, addr->sa_data, ETH_ALEN);
                                    // dev_ifsioc_locked()
                                    memcpy(ifr->ifr_hwaddr.sa_data,
                                            dev->dev_addr,...);
    
    Close this race condition by guarding them with a RW semaphore,
    like netdev_get_name(). We can not use seqlock here as it does not
    allow blocking. The writers already take RTNL anyway, so this does
    not affect the slow path. To avoid bothering existing
    dev_set_mac_address() callers in drivers, introduce a new wrapper
    just for user-facing callers on ioctl and rtnetlink paths.
    
    Note, bonding also changes slave mac addresses but that requires
    a separate patch due to the complexity of bonding code.

    net: psample: Fix netlink skb length with tunnel info
    
    commit a93dcaada2ddb58dbc72652b42548adedd646d7a upstream.
    
    Currently, the psample netlink skb is allocated with a size that does
    not account for the nested 'PSAMPLE_ATTR_TUNNEL' attribute and the
    padding required for the 64-bit attribute 'PSAMPLE_TUNNEL_KEY_ATTR_ID'.
    This can result in failure to add attributes to the netlink skb due
    to insufficient tail room. The following error message is printed to
    the kernel log: "Could not create psample log message".
    
    Fix this by adjusting the allocation size to take into account the
    nested attribute and the padding.

    use switchdev notifiers only in case of netlink provided port flags but
    not sysfs (as a sort of deprecation, punishment or anything like that),
    so we should probably keep the user interface consistent in terms of

    commit 52557dbc7538ecceb27ef2206719a47a8039a335 upstream.
    
    MPJ subflows are not exposed as fds to user spaces. As such,
    incoming MPJ subflows are removed from the accept queue by
    tcp_check_req()/tcp_get_cookie_sock().
    
    Later tcp_child_process() invokes subflow_data_ready() on the
    parent socket regardless of the subflow kind, leading to poll
    wakeups even if the later accept will block.
    
    Address the issue by double-checking the queue state before
    waking the user-space.

    mm/hugetlb.c: fix unnecessary address expansion of pmd sharing
    
    commit a1ba9da8f0f9a37d900ff7eff66482cf7de8015e upstream.
    
    The current code would unnecessarily expand the address range.  Consider
    one example, (start, end) = (1G-2M, 3G+2M), and (vm_start, vm_end) =
    (1G-4M, 3G+4M), the expected adjustment should be keep (1G-2M, 3G+2M)
    without expand.  But the current result will be (1G-4M, 3G+4M).  Actually,
    the range (1G-4M, 1G) and (3G, 3G+4M) would never been involved in pmd
    sharing.
    
    After this patch, we will check that the vma span at least one PUD aligned
    size and the start,end range overlap the aligned range of vma.
    
    With above example, the aligned vma range is (1G, 3G), so if (start, end)
    range is within (1G-4M, 1G), or within (3G, 3G+4M), then no adjustment to
    both start and end.  Otherwise, we will have chance to adjust start
    downwards or end upwards without exceeding (vm_start, vm_end).
    
    Mike:
    
    : The 'adjusted range' is used for calls to mmu notifiers and cache(tlb)
    : flushing.  Since the current code unnecessarily expands the range in some
    : cases, more entries than necessary would be flushed.  This would/could
    : result in performance degradation.  However, this is highly dependent on
    : the user runtime.  Is there a combination of vma layout and calls to
    : actually hit this issue?  If the issue is hit, will those entries
    : unnecessarily flushed be used again and need to be unnecessarily reloaded?

    nbd: handle device refs for DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT properly
    
    commit c9a2f90f4d6b9d42b9912f7aaf68e8d748acfffd upstream.
    
    There exists a race where we can be attempting to create a new nbd
    configuration while a previous configuration is going down, both
    configured with DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT.  Normally devices all have a
    reference of 1, as they won't be cleaned up until the module is torn
    down.  However with DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT we'll make sure that there is
    only 1 reference (generally) on the device for the config itself, and
    then once the config is dropped, the device is torn down.
    
    The race that exists looks like this
    
    TASK1                                   TASK2
    nbd_genl_connect()
      idr_find()
        refcount_inc_not_zero(nbd)
          * count is 2 here ^^
                                            nbd_config_put()
                                              nbd_put(nbd) (count is 1)
        setup new config
          check DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT
            put_dev = true
        if (put_dev) nbd_put(nbd)
            * free'd here ^^
    
    In nbd_genl_connect() we assume that the nbd ref count will be 2,
    however clearly that won't be true if the nbd device had been setup as
    DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT with its prior configuration.  Fix this by getting
    rid of the runtime flag to check if we need to mess with the nbd device
    refcount, and use the device NBD_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT flag to check if
    we need to adjust the ref counts.  This was reported by syzkaller with
    the following kasan dump

    riscv: Get rid of MAX_EARLY_MAPPING_SIZE
    
    commit 0f02de4481da684aad6589aed0ea47bd1ab391c9 upstream.
    
    At early boot stage, we have a whole PGDIR to map the kernel, so there
    is no need to restrict the early mapping size to 128MB. Removing this
    define also allows us to simplify some compile time logic.
    
    This fixes large kernel mappings with a size greater than 128MB, as it
    is the case for syzbot kernels whose size was just ~130MB.
    
    Note that on rv64, for now, we are then limited to PGDIR size for early
    mapping as we can't use PGD mappings (see [1]). That should be enough
    given the relative small size of syzbot kernels compared to PGDIR_SIZE
    which is 1GB.

    net: fix up truesize of cloned skb in skb_prepare_for_shift()
    
    commit 097b9146c0e26aabaa6ff3e5ea536a53f5254a79 upstream.
    
    Avoid the assumption that ksize(kmalloc(S)) == ksize(kmalloc(S)): when
    cloning an skb, save and restore truesize after pskb_expand_head(). This
    can occur if the allocator decides to service an allocation of the same
    size differently (e.g. use a different size class, or pass the
    allocation on to KFENCE).
    
    Because truesize is used for bookkeeping (such as sk_wmem_queued), a
    modified truesize of a cloned skb may result in corrupt bookkeeping and
    relevant warnings (such as in sk_stream_kill_queues()).

    tomoyo: ignore data race while checking quota
    
    commit 5797e861e402fff2bedce4ec8b7c89f4248b6073 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting that tomoyo's quota check is racy [1]. But this check
    is tolerant of some degree of inaccuracy. Thus, teach KCSAN to ignore
    this data race.

    smackfs: restrict bytes count in smackfs write functions
    
    commit 7ef4c19d245f3dc233fd4be5acea436edd1d83d8 upstream.
    
    syzbot found WARNINGs in several smackfs write operations where
    bytes count is passed to memdup_user_nul which exceeds
    GFP MAX_ORDER. Check count size if bigger than PAGE_SIZE.
    
    Per smackfs doc, smk_write_net4addr accepts any label or -CIPSO,
    smk_write_net6addr accepts any label or -DELETE. I couldn't find
    any general rule for other label lengths except SMK_LABELLEN,
    SMK_LONGLABEL, SMK_CIPSOMAX which are documented.
    
    Let's constrain, in general, smackfs label lengths for PAGE_SIZE.
    Although fuzzer crashes write to smackfs/netlabel on 0x400000 length.
    
    Here is a quick way to reproduce the WARNING:
    python -c "print('A' * 0x400000)" > /sys/fs/smackfs/netlabel

    erofs: fix shift-out-of-bounds of blkszbits
    
    commit bde545295b710bdd13a0fcd4b9fddd2383eeeb3a upstream.
    
    syzbot generated a crafted bitszbits which can be shifted
    out-of-bounds[1]. So directly print unsupported blkszbits
    instead of blksize.

    sched/core: Allow try_invoke_on_locked_down_task() with irqs disabled
    
    commit 1b7af295541d75535374325fd617944534853919 upstream.
    
    The try_invoke_on_locked_down_task() function currently requires
    that interrupts be enabled, but it is called with interrupts
    disabled from rcu_print_task_stall(), resulting in an "IRQs not
    enabled as expected" diagnostic.  This commit therefore updates
    try_invoke_on_locked_down_task() to use raw_spin_lock_irqsave() instead
    of raw_spin_lock_irq(), thus allowing use from either context.

    JFS: more checks for invalid superblock
    
    commit 3bef198f1b17d1bb89260bad947ef084c0a2d1a6 upstream.
    
    syzbot is feeding invalid superblock data to JFS for mount testing.
    JFS does not check several of the fields -- just assumes that they
    are good since the JFS_MAGIC and version fields are good.
    
    In this case (syzbot reproducer), we have s_l2bsize == 0xda0c,
    pad == 0xf045, and s_state == 0x50, all of which are invalid IMO.
    Having s_l2bsize == 0xda0c causes this UBSAN warning:
      UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in fs/jfs/jfs_mount.c:373:25
      shift exponent -9716 is negative
    
    s_l2bsize can be tested for correctness. pad can be tested for non-0
    and punted. s_state can be tested for its valid values and punted.
    
    Do those 3 tests and if any of them fails, report the superblock as
    invalid/corrupt and let fsck handle it.
    
    With this patch, chkSuper() says this when JFS_DEBUG is enabled:
      jfs_mount: Mount Failure: superblock is corrupt!
      Mount JFS Failure: -22
      jfs_mount failed w/return code = -22
    
    The obvious problem with this method is that next week there could
    be another syzbot test that uses different fields for invalid values,
    this making this like a game of whack-a-mole.

    x86/build: Treat R_386_PLT32 relocation as R_386_PC32
    
    commit bb73d07148c405c293e576b40af37737faf23a6a upstream.
    
    This is similar to commit
    
      b21ebf2fb4cd ("x86: Treat R_X86_64_PLT32 as R_X86_64_PC32")
    
    but for i386. As far as the kernel is concerned, R_386_PLT32 can be
    treated the same as R_386_PC32.
    
    R_386_PLT32/R_X86_64_PLT32 are PC-relative relocation types which
    can only be used by branches. If the referenced symbol is defined
    externally, a PLT will be used.
    
    R_386_PC32/R_X86_64_PC32 are PC-relative relocation types which can be
    used by address taking operations and branches. If the referenced symbol
    is defined externally, a copy relocation/canonical PLT entry will be
    created in the executable.
    
    On x86-64, there is no PIC vs non-PIC PLT distinction and an
    R_X86_64_PLT32 relocation is produced for both `call/jmp foo` and
    `call/jmp foo@PLT` with newer (2018) GNU as/LLVM integrated assembler.
    This avoids canonical PLT entries (st_shndx=0, st_value!=0).
    
    On i386, there are 2 types of PLTs, PIC and non-PIC. Currently,
    the GCC/GNU as convention is to use R_386_PC32 for non-PIC PLT and
    R_386_PLT32 for PIC PLT. Copy relocations/canonical PLT entries
    are possible ABI issues but GCC/GNU as will likely keep the status
    quo because (1) the ABI is legacy (2) the change will drop a GNU
    ld diagnostic for non-default visibility ifunc in shared objects.
    
    clang-12 -fno-pic (since [1]) can emit R_386_PLT32 for compiler
    generated function declarations, because preventing canonical PLT
    entries is weighed over the rare ifunc diagnostic.

    drm/virtio: use kvmalloc for large allocations
    
    commit ea86f3defd55f141a44146e66cbf8ffb683d60da upstream.
    
    We observed that some of virtio_gpu_object_shmem_init() allocations
    can be rather costly - order 6 - which can be difficult to fulfill
    under memory pressure conditions. Switch to kvmalloc_array() in
    virtio_gpu_object_shmem_init() and let the kernel vmalloc the entries
    array.
