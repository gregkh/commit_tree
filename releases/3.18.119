    Bluetooth: hidp: buffer overflow in hidp_process_report
    
    commit 7992c18810e568b95c869b227137a2215702a805 upstream.
    
    CVE-2018-9363
    
    The buffer length is unsigned at all layers, but gets cast to int and
    checked in hidp_process_report and can lead to a buffer overflow.
    Switch len parameter to unsigned int to resolve issue.
    
    This affects 3.18 and newer kernels.

    crypto: ablkcipher - fix crash flushing dcache in error path
    
    commit 318abdfbe708aaaa652c79fb500e9bd60521f9dc upstream.
    
    Like the skcipher_walk and blkcipher_walk cases:
    
    scatterwalk_done() is only meant to be called after a nonzero number of
    bytes have been processed, since scatterwalk_pagedone() will flush the
    dcache of the *previous* page.  But in the error case of
    ablkcipher_walk_done(), e.g. if the input wasn't an integer number of
    blocks, scatterwalk_done() was actually called after advancing 0 bytes.
    This caused a crash ("BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request")
    during '!PageSlab(page)' on architectures like arm and arm64 that define
    ARCH_IMPLEMENTS_FLUSH_DCACHE_PAGE, provided that the input was
    page-aligned as in that case walk->offset == 0.
    
    Fix it by reorganizing ablkcipher_walk_done() to skip the
    scatterwalk_advance() and scatterwalk_done() if an error has occurred.

    crypto: vmac - separate tfm and request context
    
    commit bb29648102335586e9a66289a1d98a0cb392b6e5 upstream.
    
    syzbot reported a crash in vmac_final() when multiple threads
    concurrently use the same "vmac(aes)" transform through AF_ALG.  The bug
    is pretty fundamental: the VMAC template doesn't separate per-request
    state from per-tfm (per-key) state like the other hash algorithms do,
    but rather stores it all in the tfm context.  That's wrong.
    
    Also, vmac_final() incorrectly zeroes most of the state including the
    derived keys and cached pseudorandom pad.  Therefore, only the first
    VMAC invocation with a given key calculates the correct digest.
    
    Fix these bugs by splitting the per-tfm state from the per-request state
    and using the proper init/update/final sequencing for requests.
    
    Reproducer for the crash:
    
        #include <linux/if_alg.h>
        #include <sys/socket.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
    
        int main()
        {
                int fd;
                struct sockaddr_alg addr = {
                        .salg_type = "hash",
                        .salg_name = "vmac(aes)",
                };
                char buf[256] = { 0 };
    
                fd = socket(AF_ALG, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);
                bind(fd, (void *)&addr, sizeof(addr));
                setsockopt(fd, SOL_ALG, ALG_SET_KEY, buf, 16);
                fork();
                fd = accept(fd, NULL, NULL);
                for (;;)
                        write(fd, buf, 256);
        }
    
    The immediate cause of the crash is that vmac_ctx_t.partial_size exceeds
    VMAC_NHBYTES, causing vmac_final() to memset() a negative length.

    crypto: vmac - require a block cipher with 128-bit block size
    
    commit 73bf20ef3df262026c3470241ae4ac8196943ffa upstream.
    
    The VMAC template assumes the block cipher has a 128-bit block size, but
    it failed to check for that.  Thus it was possible to instantiate it
    using a 64-bit block size cipher, e.g. "vmac(cast5)", causing
    uninitialized memory to be used.
    
    Add the needed check when instantiating the template.

    To fix this, give dma_unmap_single() the "dev" parameter, just like

    ALSA: info: Check for integer overflow in snd_info_entry_write()
    
    Commit 4adb7bcbcb69 ("ALSA: core: Use seq_file for text proc file
    reads") heavily refactored ALSA procfs and fixed the overflow as
    a side-effect, so this fix only applies to kernels < 4.2 and
    there is no upstream equivalent
    
    snd_info_entry_write() resizes the buffer with an unsigned long
    size argument that gets truncated because resize_info_buffer()
    takes the size parameter as an unsigned int. On 64-bit kernels,
    this causes the following copy_to_user() to write out-of-bounds
    if (pos + count) can't be represented by an unsigned int.

    ARM: dts: imx6sx: fix irq for pcie bridge
    
    commit 1bcfe0564044be578841744faea1c2f46adc8178 upstream.
    
    Use the correct IRQ line for the MSI controller in the PCIe host
    controller. Apparently a different IRQ line is used compared to other
    i.MX6 variants. Without this change MSI IRQs aren't properly propagated
    to the upstream interrupt controller.

    fix __legitimize_mnt()/mntput() race
    
    commit 119e1ef80ecfe0d1deb6378d4ab41f5b71519de1 upstream.
    
    __legitimize_mnt() has two problems - one is that in case of success
    the check of mount_lock is not ordered wrt preceding increment of
    refcount, making it possible to have successful __legitimize_mnt()
    on one CPU just before the otherwise final mntpu() on another,
    with __legitimize_mnt() not seeing mntput() taking the lock and
    mntput() not seeing the increment done by __legitimize_mnt().
    Solved by a pair of barriers.
    
    Another is that failure of __legitimize_mnt() on the second
    read_seqretry() leaves us with reference that'll need to be
    dropped by caller; however, if that races with final mntput()
    we can end up with caller dropping rcu_read_lock() and doing
    mntput() to release that reference - with the first mntput()
    having freed the damn thing just as rcu_read_lock() had been
    dropped.  Solution: in "do mntput() yourself" failure case
    grab mount_lock, check if MNT_DOOMED has been set by racing
    final mntput() that has missed our increment and if it has -
    undo the increment and treat that as "failure, caller doesn't
    need to drop anything" case.
    
    It's not easy to hit - the final mntput() has to come right
    after the first read_seqretry() in __legitimize_mnt() *and*
    manage to miss the increment done by __legitimize_mnt() before
    the second read_seqretry() in there.  The things that are almost
    impossible to hit on bare hardware are not impossible on SMP
    KVM, though...

    fix mntput/mntput race
    
    commit 9ea0a46ca2c318fcc449c1e6b62a7230a17888f1 upstream.
    
    mntput_no_expire() does the calculation of total refcount under mount_lock;
    unfortunately, the decrement (as well as all increments) are done outside
    of it, leading to false positives in the "are we dropping the last reference"
    test.  Consider the following situation:
            * mnt is a lazy-umounted mount, kept alive by two opened files.  One
    of those files gets closed.  Total refcount of mnt is 2.  On CPU 42
    mntput(mnt) (called from __fput()) drops one reference, decrementing component
            * After it has looked at component #0, the process on CPU 0 does
    mntget(), incrementing component #0, gets preempted and gets to run again -
    on CPU 69.  There it does mntput(), which drops the reference (component #69)
    and proceeds to spin on mount_lock.
            * On CPU 42 our first mntput() finishes counting.  It observes the
    decrement of component #69, but not the increment of component #0.  As the
    result, the total it gets is not 1 as it should've been - it's 0.  At which
    point we decide that vfsmount needs to be killed and proceed to free it and
    shut the filesystem down.  However, there's still another opened file
    on that filesystem, with reference to (now freed) vfsmount, etc. and we are
    screwed.
    
    It's not a wide race, but it can be reproduced with artificial slowdown of
    the mnt_get_count() loop, and it should be easier to hit on SMP KVM setups.
    
    Fix consists of moving the refcount decrement under mount_lock; the tricky
    part is that we want (and can) keep the fast case (i.e. mount that still
    has non-NULL ->mnt_ns) entirely out of mount_lock.  All places that zero
    mnt->mnt_ns are dropping some reference to mnt and they call synchronize_rcu()
    before that mntput().  IOW, if mntput() observes (under rcu_read_lock())
    a non-NULL ->mnt_ns, it is guaranteed that there is another reference yet to
    be dropped.

    root dentries need RCU-delayed freeing
    
    commit 90bad5e05bcdb0308cfa3d3a60f5c0b9c8e2efb3 upstream.
    
    Since mountpoint crossing can happen without leaving lazy mode,
    root dentries do need the same protection against having their
    memory freed without RCU delay as everything else in the tree.
    
    It's partially hidden by RCU delay between detaching from the
    mount tree and dropping the vfsmount reference, but the starting
    point of pathwalk can be on an already detached mount, in which
    case umount-caused RCU delay has already passed by the time the
    lazy pathwalk grabs rcu_read_lock().  If the starting point
    happens to be at the root of that vfsmount *and* that vfsmount
    covers the entire filesystem, we get trouble.
