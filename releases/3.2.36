    ramoops: fix use of rounddown_pow_of_two()
    
    commit fdb5950754eb3dedb9fea7c8828d3e51d9dbc3f7 upstream.
    
    The return value of rounddown_pow_of_two wasn't evaluated, so the
    operation was a no-op.

    staging: vt6656: 64bit fixes: vCommandTimerWait change calculation of timer.
    
    commit 70e227790d4ee4590023d8041a3485f8053593fc upstream.
    
    The timer appears to run too fast/race on 64 bit systems.
    
    Using msecs_to_jiffies seems to cause a deadlock on 64 bit.
    
    A calculation of (MSecond * HZ) / 1000 appears to run satisfactory.
    
    Change BSSIDInfoCount to u32.
    
    After this patch the driver can be successfully connect on little endian 64/32 bit systems.

    thp, memcg: split hugepage for memcg oom on cow
    
    commit 1f1d06c34f7675026326cd9f39ff91e4555cf355 upstream.
    
    On COW, a new hugepage is allocated and charged to the memcg.  If the
    system is oom or the charge to the memcg fails, however, the fault
    handler will return VM_FAULT_OOM which results in an oom kill.
    
    Instead, it's possible to fallback to splitting the hugepage so that the
    COW results only in an order-0 page being allocated and charged to the
    memcg which has a higher liklihood to succeed.  This is expensive
    because the hugepage must be split in the page fault handler, but it is
    much better than unnecessarily oom killing a process.

    Fix it by removing the hardcoded logic, using snprintf() instead.

    MISC: hpilo, remove pci_disable_device
    
    commit bcdee04ea7ae0406ae69094f6df1aacb66a69a0b upstream.
    
    pci_disable_device(pdev) used to be in pci remove function. But this
    PCI device has two functions with interrupt lines connected to a
    single pin. The other one is a USB host controller. So when we disable
    the PIN there e.g. by rmmod hpilo, the controller stops working. It is
    because the interrupt link is disabled in ACPI since it is not
    refcounted yet. See acpi_pci_link_free_irq called from
    acpi_pci_irq_disable.
    
    It is not the best solution whatsoever, but as a workaround until the
    ACPI irq link refcounting is sorted out this should fix the reported
    errors.

    ipv4: ip_check_defrag must not modify skb before unsharing
    
    [ Upstream commit 1bf3751ec90cc3174e01f0d701e8449ce163d113 ]
    
    ip_check_defrag() might be called from af_packet within the
    RX path where shared SKBs are used, so it must not modify
    the input SKB before it has unshared it for defragmentation.
    Use skb_copy_bits() to get the IP header and only pull in
    everything later.
    
    The same is true for the other caller in macvlan as it is
    called from dev->rx_handler which can also get a shared SKB.

    sctp: fix memory leak in sctp_datamsg_from_user() when copy from user space fails
    
    [ Upstream commit be364c8c0f17a3dd42707b5a090b318028538eb9 ]
    
    Trinity (the syscall fuzzer) discovered a memory leak in SCTP,
    reproducible e.g. with the sendto() syscall by passing invalid
    user space pointer in the second argument:
    
     #include <string.h>
     #include <arpa/inet.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>
    
     int main(void)
     {
             int fd;
             struct sockaddr_in sa;
    
             fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 132 /*IPPROTO_SCTP*/);
             if (fd < 0)
                     return 1;
    
             memset(&sa, 0, sizeof(sa));
             sa.sin_family = AF_INET;
             sa.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");
             sa.sin_port = htons(11111);
    
             sendto(fd, NULL, 1, 0, (struct sockaddr *)&sa, sizeof(sa));
    
             return 0;
     }
    
    As far as I can tell, the leak has been around since ~2003.

    USB: cdc-wdm: fix regression on buffer deallocation
    
    [ no commit upstream, since usb_alloc_coherent usage was removed from
      the driver before this was fixed ]
    
    Commit cafbe85 ("USB: cdc-wdm: better allocate a buffer that is at least
    as big as we tell the USB core") introduced a regression: it changed
    the size used in usb_alloc_coherent, but failed to do the same for the
    usb_free_coherent calls.
    
    It also was marked for stable and got backported to older kernels. But
    in the upstream kernel, the usage of usb_alloc_coherent was right after
    removed from the driver, so upstream doesn't have this problem, while
    the stable kernels still have, and thus need this fix.

    dm ioctl: prevent unsafe change to dm_ioctl data_size
    
    commit e910d7ebecd1aac43125944a8641b6cb1a0dfabe upstream.
    
    Abort dm ioctl processing if userspace changes the data_size parameter
    after we validated it but before we finished copying the data buffer
    from userspace.
    
    The dm ioctl parameters are processed in the following sequence:
     1. ctl_ioctl() calls copy_params();
     2. copy_params() makes a first copy of the fixed-sized portion of the
        userspace parameters into the local variable "tmp";
     3. copy_params() then validates tmp.data_size and allocates a new
        structure big enough to hold the complete data and copies the whole
        userspace buffer there;
     4. ctl_ioctl() reads userspace data the second time and copies the whole
        buffer into the pointer "param";
     5. ctl_ioctl() reads param->data_size without any validation and stores it
        in the variable "input_param_size";
     6. "input_param_size" is further used as the authoritative size of the
        kernel buffer.
    
    The problem is that userspace code could change the contents of user
    memory between steps 2 and 4.  In particular, the data_size parameter
    can be changed to an invalid value after the kernel has validated it.
    This lets userspace force the kernel to access invalid kernel memory.
    
    The fix is to ensure that the size has not changed at step 4.
    
    This patch shouldn't have a security impact because CAP_SYS_ADMIN is
    required to run this code, but it should be fixed anyway.

    struct node is already defined in include/linux/node.h. On sparc32, it

    SGI-XP: handle non-fatal traps
    
    commit 891348ca0f66206f1dc0e30d63757e3df1ae2d15 upstream.
    
    We found a user code which was raising a divide-by-zero trap.  That trap
    would lead to XPC connections between system-partitions being torn down
    due to the die_chain notifier callouts it received.
    
    This also revealed a different issue where multiple callers into
    xpc_die_deactivate() would all attempt to do the disconnect in parallel
    which would sometimes lock up but often overwhelm the console on very
    large machines as each would print at least one line of output at the
    end of the deactivate.
    
    I reviewed all the users of the die_chain notifier and changed the code
    to ignore the notifier callouts for reasons which will not actually lead
    to a system to continue on to call die().

    exec: do not leave bprm->interp on stack
    
    commit b66c5984017533316fd1951770302649baf1aa33 upstream.
    
    If a series of scripts are executed, each triggering module loading via
    unprintable bytes in the script header, kernel stack contents can leak
    into the command line.
    
    Normally execution of binfmt_script and binfmt_misc happens recursively.
    However, when modules are enabled, and unprintable bytes exist in the
    bprm->buf, execution will restart after attempting to load matching
    binfmt modules.  Unfortunately, the logic in binfmt_script and
    binfmt_misc does not expect to get restarted.  They leave bprm->interp
    pointing to their local stack.  This means on restart bprm->interp is
    left pointing into unused stack memory which can then be copied into the
    userspace argv areas.
    
    After additional study, it seems that both recursion and restart remains
    the desirable way to handle exec with scripts, misc, and modules.  As
    such, we need to protect the changes to interp.
    
    This changes the logic to require allocation for any changes to the
    bprm->interp.  To avoid adding a new kmalloc to every exec, the default
    value is left as-is.  Only when passing through binfmt_script or
    binfmt_misc does an allocation take place.
    
    For a proof of concept, see DoTest.sh from:

    vfs: d_obtain_alias() needs to use "/" as default name.
    
    commit b911a6bdeef5848c468597d040e3407e0aee04ce upstream.
    
    NFS appears to use d_obtain_alias() to create the root dentry rather than
    d_make_root.  This can cause 'prepend_path()' to complain that the root
    has a weird name if an NFS filesystem is lazily unmounted.  e.g.  if
    "/mnt" is an NFS mount then
    
     { cd /mnt; umount -l /mnt ; ls -l /proc/self/cwd; }
    
    will cause a WARN message like
       WARNING: at /home/git/linux/fs/dcache.c:2624 prepend_path+0x1d7/0x1e0()
       ...
       Root dentry has weird name <>
    
    to appear in kernel logs.
    
    So change d_obtain_alias() to use "/" rather than "" as the anonymous
    name.

    intel-iommu: Free old page tables before creating superpage
    
    commit 6491d4d02893d9787ba67279595990217177b351 upstream.
    
    The dma_pte_free_pagetable() function will only free a page table page
    if it is asked to free the *entire* 2MiB range that it covers. So if a
    page table page was used for one or more small mappings, it's likely to
    end up still present in the page tables... but with no valid PTEs.
    
    This was fine when we'd only be repopulating it with 4KiB PTEs anyway
    but the same virtual address range can end up being reused for a
    *large-page* mapping. And in that case were were trying to insert the
    large page into the second-level page table, and getting a complaint
    from the sanity check in __domain_mapping() because there was already a
    corresponding entry. This was *relatively* harmless; it led to a memory
    leak of the old page table page, but no other ill-effects.
    
    Fix it by calling dma_pte_clear_range (hopefully redundant) and
    dma_pte_free_pagetable() before setting up the new large page.

    CRIS: fix I/O macros
    
    commit c24bf9b4cc6a0f330ea355d73bfdf1dae7e63a05 upstream.
    
    The inb/outb macros for CRIS are broken from a number of points of view,
    missing () around parameters and they have an unprotected if statement
    in them.  This was breaking the compile of IPMI on CRIS and thus I was
    being annoyed by build regressions, so I fixed them.
    
    Plus I don't think they would have worked at all, since the data values
    were missing "&" and the outsl had a "3" instead of a "4" for the size.
    From what I can tell, this stuff is not used at all, so this can't be
    any more broken than it was before, anyway.

    commit d5f50b0c290431c65377c4afa1c764e2c3fe5305 upstream.
    
    If the argument and reply together exceed the maximum payload size, then
    a reply with a read-like operation can overlow the rq_pages array.

    proc: pid/status: show all supplementary groups
    
    commit 8d238027b87e654be552eabdf492042a34c5c300 upstream.
    
    We display a list of supplementary group for each process in
    /proc/<pid>/status.  However, we show only the first 32 groups, not all of
    them.
    
    Although this is rare, but sometimes processes do have more than 32
    supplementary groups, and this kernel limitation breaks user-space apps
    that rely on the group list in /proc/<pid>/status.
    
    Number 32 comes from the internal NGROUPS_SMALL macro which defines the
    length for the internal kernel "small" groups buffer.  There is no
    apparent reason to limit to this value.
    
    This patch removes the 32 groups printing limit.
    
    The Linux kernel limits the amount of supplementary groups by NGROUPS_MAX,
    which is currently set to 65536.  And this is the maximum count of groups
    we may possibly print.

    ALSA: hda - Fix the wrong pincaps set in ALC861VD dallas/hp fixup
    
    commit b78562b10fa66175e30b76073e32a0ad8d92aa83 upstream.
    
    The workaround to force VREF50 for dallas/hp model with ALC861VD
    was introduced in commit 8fdcb6fe4204bdb4c6991652717ab5063751414e,

    ALSA: hda - Always turn on pins for HDMI/DP
    
    commit 6169b673618bf0b2518ce413b54925782a603f06 upstream.
    
    We've seen the broken HDMI *video* output on some machines with GM965,
    and the debugging session pointed that the culprit is the disabled
    audio output pins.  Toggling these pins dynamically on demand caused
    flickering of HDMI TV.
    
    This patch changes the behavior to keep the pin ON constantly.

    MIPS: Fix poweroff failure when HOTPLUG_CPU configured.
    
    commit 8add1ecb81f541ef2fcb0b85a5470ad9ecfb4a84 upstream.
    
    When poweroff machine, kernel_power_off() call disable_nonboot_cpus().
    And if we have HOTPLUG_CPU configured, disable_nonboot_cpus() is not an
    empty function but attempt to actually disable the nonboot cpus. Since
    system state is SYSTEM_POWER_OFF, play_dead() won't be called and thus
    disable_nonboot_cpus() hangs. Therefore, we make this patch to avoid
    poweroff failure.

    mtd: nand: gpmi: reset BCH earlier, too, to avoid NAND startup problems
    
    commit 6f2a6a52560ad8d85710aabd92b7a3239b3a6b07 upstream.
    
    It could happen (1 out of 100 times) that NAND did not start up
    correctly after warm rebooting, so the kernel could not find the UBI or
    DMA timed out due to a stalled BCH. When resetting BCH together with
    GPMI, the issue could not be observed anymore (after 10000+ reboots). We
    probably need the consistent state already before sending any command to
    NAND, even when no ECC is needed. I chose to keep the extra reset for
    BCH when changing the flash layout to be on the safe side.

    target/tcm_fc: fix the lockdep warning due to inconsistent lock state
    
    commit 9f4ad44b264f8bb61ffdd607148215566568430d upstream.
    
    The lockdep warning below is in theory correct but it will be in really weird
    rare situation that ends up that deadlock since the tcm fc session is hashed
    based the rport id. Nonetheless, the complaining below is about rcu callback
    that does the transport_deregister_session() is happening in softirq, where
    transport_register_session() that happens earlier is not. This triggers the
    lockdep warning below. So, just fix this to make lockdep happy by disabling
    the soft irq before calling transport_register_session() in ft_prli.
    
    BTW, this was found in FCoE VN2VN over two VMs, couple of create and destroy
    would get this triggered.
    
    v1: was enforcing register to be in softirq context which was not righ. See,
    http://www.spinics.net/lists/target-devel/msg03614.html
    
    v2: following comments from Roland&Nick (thanks), it seems we don't have to
    do transport_deregister_session() in rcu callback, so move it into ft_sess_free()
    but still do kfree() of the corresponding ft_sess struct in rcu callback to
    make sure the ft_sess is not freed till the rcu callback.

    NFS: avoid NULL dereference in nfs_destroy_server
    
    commit f259613a1e4b44a0cf85a5dafd931be96ee7c9e5 upstream.
    
    In rare circumstances, nfs_clone_server() of a v2 or v3 server can get
    an error between setting server->destory (to nfs_destroy_server), and
    calling nfs_start_lockd (which will set server->nlm_host).
    
    If this happens, nfs_clone_server will call nfs_free_server which
    will call nfs_destroy_server and thence nlmclnt_done(NULL).  This
    causes the NULL to be dereferenced.
    
    So add a guard to only call nlmclnt_done() if ->nlm_host is not NULL.
    
    The other guards there are irrelevant as nlm_host can only be non-NULL
    if one of these flags are set - so remove those tests.  (Thanks to Trond
    for this suggestion).
    
    This is suitable for any stable kernel since 2.6.25.

    x86, 8042: Enable A20 using KBC to fix S3 resume on some MSI laptops
    
    commit ad68652412276f68ad4fe3e1ecf5ee6880876783 upstream.
    
    Some MSI laptop BIOSes are broken - INT 15h code uses port 92h to enable A20
    line but resume code assumes that KBC was used.
    The laptop will not resume from S3 otherwise but powers off after a while
    and then powers on again stuck with a blank screen.
    
    Fix it by enabling A20 using KBC in i8042_platform_init for x86.

    mm: dmapool: use provided gfp flags for all dma_alloc_coherent() calls
    
    commit 387870f2d6d679746020fa8e25ef786ff338dc98 upstream.
    
    dmapool always calls dma_alloc_coherent() with GFP_ATOMIC flag,
    regardless the flags provided by the caller. This causes excessive
    pruning of emergency memory pools without any good reason. Additionaly,
    on ARM architecture any driver which is using dmapools will sooner or
    later  trigger the following error:
    "ERROR: 256 KiB atomic DMA coherent pool is too small!
    Please increase it with coherent_pool= kernel parameter!".
    Increasing the coherent pool size usually doesn't help much and only
    delays such error, because all GFP_ATOMIC DMA allocations are always
    served from the special, very limited memory pool.
    
    This patch changes the dmapool code to correctly use gfp flags provided
    by the dmapool caller.

    iwlwifi: don't handle masked interrupt
    
    commit 25a172655f837bdb032e451f95441bb4acec51bb upstream.
    
    This can lead to a panic if the driver isn't ready to
    handle them. Since our interrupt line is shared, we can get
    an interrupt at any time (and CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ checks
    that even when the interrupt is being freed).
    
    If the op_mode has gone away, we musn't call it. To avoid
    this the transport disables the interrupts when the hw is
    stopped and the op_mode is leaving.
    If there is an event that would cause an interrupt the INTA
    register is updated regardless of the enablement of the
    interrupts: even if the interrupts are disabled, the INTA
    will be changed, but the device won't issue an interrupt.
    But the ISR can be called at any time, so we ought ignore
    the value in the INTA otherwise we can call the op_mode
    after it was freed.
    
    I found this bug when the op_mode_start failed, and called
    iwl_trans_stop_hw(trans, true). Then I played with the
    RFKILL button, and removed the module.
    While removing the module, the IRQ is freed, and the ISR is
    called (CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ enabled). Panic.

    nfsd: avoid permission checks on EXCLUSIVE_CREATE replay
    
    commit 7007c90fb9fef593b4aeaeee57e6a6754276c97c upstream.
    
    With NFSv4, if we create a file then open it we explicit avoid checking
    the permissions on the file during the open because the fact that we
    created it ensures we should be allow to open it (the create and the
    open should appear to be a single operation).
    
    However if the reply to an EXCLUSIVE create gets lots and the client
    resends the create, the current code will perform the permission check -
    because it doesn't realise that it did the open already..
    
    This patch should fix this.
    
    Note that I haven't actually seen this cause a problem.  I was just
    looking at the code trying to figure out a different EXCLUSIVE open
    related issue, and this looked wrong.

    It turns out that this w/a isn't actually required on cpt/ppt and
    positively harmful on ivb/ppt when using fdi B/C links - it results in
    a black screen occasionally, with seemingfully everything working as
    it should. The only failure indication I've found in the hw is that
    eventually (but not right after the modeset completes) a pipe underrun
    is signalled.

    and changes to test, otherwise I couldn't ever have tracked this down!

    ath9k_hw: Fix signal strength / channel noise reporting
    
    commit b7c0c238898d200e80487516e2b67aba2a522cc0 upstream.
    
    While AR_PHY_CCA_NOM_VAL_* does contain the expected internal noise floor
    for a chip measured in clean air, it refers to the lowest expected reading.
    
    Depending on the frequency, this measurement can vary by about 6db, thus
    causing a higher reported channel noise and signal strength.
    
    Factor in the 6db offset when converting internal noisefloor to channel noise.
    
    This patch makes the reported values more accurate for all chips without
    affecting NF calibration behavior.

    regmap: debugfs: Avoid overflows for very small reads
    
    commit db04328c167ff8e7c57f4a3532214aeada3a82fd upstream.
    
    If count is less than the size of a register then we may hit integer
    wraparound when trying to move backwards to check if we're still in
    the buffer. Instead move the position forwards to check if it's still

    drm/i915: Close race between processing unpin task and queueing the flip
    
    commit e7d841ca03b7ab668620045cd7b428eda9f41601 upstream.
    
    Before queuing the flip but crucially after attaching the unpin-work to
    the crtc, we continue to setup the unpin-work. However, should the
    hardware fire early, we see the connected unpin-work and queue the task.
    The task then promptly runs and unpins the fb before we finish taking
    the required references or even pinning it... Havoc.
    
    To close the race, we use the flip-pending atomic to indicate when the
    flip is finally setup and enqueued. So during the flip-done processing,
    we can check more accurately whether the flip was expected.
    
    v2: Add the appropriate mb() to ensure that the writes to the page-flip
    worker are complete prior to marking it active and emitting the MI_FLIP.
    On the read side, the mb should be enforced by the spinlocks.

    but since this patch explicitly sets out to combat spurious interrupts
    with is staged activation of the unpin work we need to go full-bore on
    the barriers, too. Discussed with Chris Wilson on irc and changes

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix missing autopm for MIDI input

    The commit [88a8516a: ALSA: usbaudio: implement USB autosuspend] added

    - Manage the URB start at the first MIDI input stream open, instead of
      the time of instance creation
    - Move autopm code to the common substream_open()
    - Make snd_usbmidi_input_start/_stop() more robust and add the running

    s390/cio: fix pgid reserved check
    
    commit d99e79ec5574fc556c988f613ed6175f6de66f4a upstream.
    
    The check to whom a device is reserved is done by checking the path
    state of the affected channel paths. If it turns out that one path is
    flagged as reserved by someone else the whole device is marked as such.
    
    However the meaning of the RESVD_ELSE bit is that the addressed device
    is reserved to a different pathgroup (and not reserved to a different
    LPAR). If we do this test on a path which is currently not a member of
    the pathgroup we could erroneously mark the device as reserved to
    someone else.
    
    To fix this collect the reserved state for all potential members of the
    pathgroup and only mark the device as reserved if all of those potential
    members have the RESVD_ELSE bit set.

    firewire: net: Fix handling of fragmented multicast/broadcast packets.
    
    commit 9d2373420900a39f5212a3b289331aa3535b1000 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes both the transmit and receive portion of sending
    fragmented mutlicast and broadcast packets.
    
    The transmit section was broken because the offset for INTFRAG and
    LASTFRAG packets were just miscalculated by IEEE1394_GASP_HDR_SIZE (which
    was reserved with skb_push() in fwnet_send_packet).
    
    The receive section was broken because in fwnet_incoming_packet is a call
    to fwnet_peer_find_by_node_id(). Called with generation == -1 it will
    not find a peer and the partial datagrams are associated to a peer.
    
    [Stefan R:  The fix to use context->card->generation is not perfect.
    It relies on the IR tasklet which processes packets from the prior bus
    generation to run before the self-ID-complete worklet which sets the
    current card generation.  Alas, there is no simple way of a race-free
    implementation.  Let's do it this way for now.]

    commit 54f7be5b831254199522523ccab4c3d954bbf576 upstream.
    
    The function rb_set_head_page() searches the list of ring buffer
    pages for a the page that has the HEAD page flag set. If it does
    not find it, it will do a WARN_ON(), disable the ring buffer and
    return NULL, as this should never happen.
    
    But if this bug happens to happen, not all callers of this function
    can handle a NULL pointer being returned from it. That needs to be
    fixed.

    ACPI / PNP: Do not crash due to stale pointer use during system resume
    
    commit a6b5e88c0e42093b9057856f35770966c8c591e3 upstream.
    
    During resume from system suspend the 'data' field of
    struct pnp_dev in pnpacpi_set_resources() may be a stale pointer,
    due to removal of the associated ACPI device node object in the
    previous suspend-resume cycle.  This happens, for example, if a
    dockable machine is booted in the docking station and then suspended
    and resumed and suspended again.  If that happens,
    pnpacpi_build_resource_template() called from pnpacpi_set_resources()
    attempts to use that pointer and crashes.
    
    However, pnpacpi_set_resources() actually checks the device's ACPI
    handle, attempts to find the ACPI device node object attached to it
    and returns an error code if that fails, so in fact it knows what the
    correct value of dev->data should be.  Use this observation to update
    dev->data with the correct value if necessary and dump a call trace
    if that's the case (once).
    
    We still need to fix the root cause of this issue, but preventing
    systems from crashing because of it is an improvement too.

    acpi/video_detect: blacklist samsung x360
    
    commit 084940d5b101e9ca91a689eb5048151b14076839 upstream.
    
    On Samsung X360, the BIOS will set a flag (VDRV) if the generic
    ACPI backlight device is used. This flag will definitively break
    the backlight interface (even the vendor interface) untill next

    ACPI: do acpisleep dmi check when CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP is set
    
    commit 0ac1b1d7b7424cd6f129b5454b504b3cae746f0e upstream.
    
    The current acpisleep DMI checks only run when CONFIG_SUSPEND is set.
    And this may break hibernation on some platforms when CONFIG_SUSPEND
    is cleared.
    
    Move acpisleep DMI check into #ifdef CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP instead.
    
    [rjw: Added acpi_sleep_dmi_check() and rebased on top of earlier
     patches adding entries to acpisleep_dmi_table[].]

    qla2xxx: Test and clear FCPORT_UPDATE_NEEDED atomically.
    
    commit a394aac88506159e047630fc90dc2242568382d8 upstream.
    
    When the qla2xxx driver loses access to multiple, remote ports, there is a race
    condition which can occur which will keep the request stuck on a scsi request
    queue indefinitely.
    
    This bad state occurred do to a race condition with how the FCPORT_UPDATE_NEEDED
    bit is set in qla2x00_schedule_rport_del(), and how it is cleared in
    qla2x00_do_dpc().  The problem port has its drport pointer set, but it has never
    been processed by the driver to inform the fc transport that the port has been
    lost.  qla2x00_schedule_rport_del() sets drport, and then sets the
    FCPORT_UPDATE_NEEDED bit.  In qla2x00_do_dpc(), the port lists are walked and
    any drport pointer is handled and the fc transport informed of the port loss,
    then the FCPORT_UPDATE_NEEDED bit is cleared.  This leaves a race where the
    dpc thread is processing one port removal, another port removal is marked
    with a call to qla2x00_schedule_rport_del(), and the dpc thread clears the
    bit for both removals, even though only the first removal was actually
    handled.  Until another event occurs to set FCPORT_UPDATE_NEEDED, the later
    port removal is never finished and qla2xxx stays in a bad state which causes
    requests to become stuck on request queues.
    
    This patch updates the driver to test and clear FCPORT_UPDATE_NEEDED
    atomically.  This ensures the port state changes are processed and not lost.

    mvsas: fix undefined bit shift
    
    commit beecadea1b8d67f591b13f7099559f32f3fd601d upstream.
    
    The macro bit(n) is defined as ((u32)1 << n), and thus it doesn't work
    with n >= 32, such as in mvs_94xx_assign_reg_set():
    
            if (i >= 32) {
                    mvi->sata_reg_set |= bit(i);
                    ...
            }
    
    The shift ((u32)1 << n) with n >= 32 also leads to undefined behavior.
    The result varies depending on the architecture.
    
    This patch changes bit(n) to do a 64-bit shift.  It also simplifies
    mv_ffc64() using __ffs64(), since invoking ffz() with ~0 is undefined.

    prevent stack buffer overflow in host_reset
    
    commit 072f19b4bea31cdd482d79f805413f2f9ac9e233 upstream.
    
    store_host_reset() has tried to re-invent the wheel to compare sysfs strings.
    Unfortunately it did so poorly and never bothered to check the input from

    echo "WoopsieWoopsie" >
    /sys/devices/pseudo_0/adapter0/host0/scsi_host/host0/host_reset
    
    would result in:

    sata_promise: fix hardreset lockdep error
    
    commit 3100d49d3cd236443faae9d81137c81b22d36003 upstream.
    
    sata_promise's pdc_hard_reset_port() needs to serialize because it
    flips a port-specific bit in controller register that's shared by
    all ports. The code takes the ata host lock for this, but that's
    broken because an interrupt may arrive on our irq during the hard
    reset sequence, and that too will take the ata host lock. With
    lockdep enabled a big nasty warning is seen.
    
    Fixed by adding private state to the ata host structure, containing
    a second lock used only for serializing the hard reset sequences.
    This eliminated the lockdep warnings both on my test rig and on
    the original reporter's machine.

    USB: OHCI: workaround for hardware bug: retired TDs not added to the Done Queue
    
    commit 50ce5c0683aa83eb161624ea89daa5a9eee0c2ce upstream.
    
    This patch (as1636) is a partial workaround for a hardware bug
    affecting OHCI controllers by NVIDIA at least, maybe others too.  When
    the controller retires a Transfer Descriptor, it is supposed to add
    the TD onto the Done Queue.  But sometimes this doesn't happen, with
    the result that ohci-hcd never realizes the corresponding transfer has
    finished.  Symptoms can vary; a typical result is that USB audio stops
    working after a while.
    
    The patch works around the problem by recognizing that TDs are always
    processed in order.  Therefore, if a later TD is found on the Done
    Queue than all the earlier TDs for the same endpoint must be finished
    as well.
    
    Unfortunately this won't solve the problem in cases where the missing
    TD is the last one in the endpoint's queue.  A complete fix would
    require a signficant amount of change to the driver.

    NFS: Add sequence_priviliged_ops for nfs4_proc_sequence()
    
    commit 6bdb5f213c4344324f600dde885f25768fbd14db upstream.
    
    If I mount an NFS v4.1 server to a single client multiple times and then
    run xfstests over each mountpoint I usually get the client into a state
    where recovery deadlocks.  The server informs the client of a
    cb_path_down sequence error, the client then does a
    bind_connection_to_session and checks the status of the lease.
    
    I found that bind_connection_to_session sets the NFS4_SESSION_DRAINING
    flag on the client, but this flag is never unset before
    nfs4_check_lease() reaches nfs4_proc_sequence().  This causes the client
    to deadlock, halting all NFS activity to the server.  nfs4_proc_sequence()
    is only called by the state manager, so I can change it to run in privileged
    mode to bypass the NFS4_SESSION_DRAINING check and avoid the deadlock.

    mfd: Only unregister platform devices allocated by the mfd core
    
    commit b9fbb62eb61452d728c39b2e5020739c575aac53 upstream.
    
    mfd_remove_devices would iterate over all devices sharing a parent with
    an mfd device regardless of whether they were allocated by the mfd core
    or not. This especially caused problems when the device structure was
    not contained within a platform_device, because to_platform_device is
    used on each device pointer.
    
    This patch defines a device_type for mfd devices and checks this is
    present from mfd_remove_devices_fn before processing the device.

    cgroup_create_dir() does weird dancing with dentry refcnt.  On
    success, it gets and then puts it achieving nothing.  On failure, it
    puts but there isn't no matching get anywhere leading to the following
    oops if cgroup_create_file() fails for whatever reason.

    ACPI / battery: Correct battery capacity values on Thinkpads
    
    commit 4000e626156935dfb626321ce09cae2c833eabbb upstream.
    
    Add a quirk to correctly report battery capacity on 2010 and 2011
    Lenovo Thinkpad models.
    
    The affected models that I tested (x201, t410, t410s, and x220)
    exhibit a problem where, when battery capacity reporting unit is mAh,
    the values being reported are wrong.  Pre-2010 and 2012 models appear
    to always report in mWh and are thus unaffected.  Also, in mid-2012
    Lenovo issued a BIOS update for the 2011 models that fixes the issue
    (tested on x220 with a post-1.29 BIOS).  No such update is available
    for the 2010 models, so those still need this patch.
    
    Problem description: for some reason, the affected Thinkpads switch
    the reporting unit between mAh and mWh; generally, mAh is used when a
    laptop is plugged in and mWh when it's unplugged, although a
    suspend/resume or rmmod/modprobe is needed for the switch to take
    effect.  The values reported in mAh are *always* wrong.  This does
    not appear to be a kernel regression; I believe that the values were
    never reported correctly.  I tested back to kernel 2.6.34, with
    multiple machines and BIOS versions.
    
    Simply plugging a laptop into mains before turning it on is enough to
    reproduce the problem.  Here's a sample /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info
    from Thinkpad x220 (before a BIOS update) with a 4-cell battery:
    
    present:                 yes
    design capacity:         2886 mAh
    last full capacity:      2909 mAh
    battery technology:      rechargeable
    design voltage:          14800 mV
    design capacity warning: 145 mAh
    design capacity low:     13 mAh
    cycle count:              0
    capacity granularity 1:  1 mAh
    capacity granularity 2:  1 mAh
    model number:            42T4899
    serial number:           21064
    battery type:            LION
    OEM info:                SANYO
    
    Once the laptop switches the unit to mWh (unplug from mains, suspend,
    resume), the output changes to:
    
    present:                 yes
    design capacity:         28860 mWh
    last full capacity:      29090 mWh
    battery technology:      rechargeable
    design voltage:          14800 mV
    design capacity warning: 1454 mWh
    design capacity low:     200 mWh
    cycle count:              0
    capacity granularity 1:  1 mWh
    capacity granularity 2:  1 mWh
    model number:            42T4899
    serial number:           21064
    battery type:            LION
    OEM info:                SANYO
    
    Can you see how the values for "design capacity", etc., differ by a
    factor of 10 instead of 14.8 (the design voltage of this battery)?
    On the battery itself it says: 14.8V, 1.95Ah, 29Wh, so clearly the
    values reported in mWh are correct and the ones in mAh are not.
    
    My guess is that this problem has been around ever since those
    machines were released, but because the most common Thinkpad
    batteries are rated at 10.8V, the error (8%) is small enough that it
    simply hasn't been noticed or at least nobody could be bothered to
    look into it.
    
    My patch works around the problem by adjusting the incorrectly
    reported mAh values by "10000 / design_voltage".  The patch also has
    code to figure out if it should be activated or not.  It only
    activates on Lenovo Thinkpads, only when the unit is mAh, and, as an
    extra precaution, only when the battery capacity reported through
    ACPI does not match what is reported through DMI (I've never
    encountered a machine where the first two conditions would be true
    but the last would not, but better safe than sorry).
    
    I've been using this patch for close to a year on several systems
    without any problems.

    There is a typo here where '&' is used instead of '|' and it turns the

    If we build a kernel with CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP=n,
    the kernel fails when we run at a non zero offset. It turns out
    we were incorrectly wrapping some of the relocatable kernel code

    rcu: Fix batch-limit size problem
    
    commit 878d7439d0f45a95869e417576774673d1fa243f upstream.
    
    Commit 29c00b4a1d9e27 (rcu: Add event-tracing for RCU callback
    invocation) added a regression in rcu_do_batch()
    
    Under stress, RCU is supposed to allow to process all items in queue,
    instead of a batch of 10 items (blimit), but an integer overflow makes
    the effective limit being 1.  So, unless there is frequent idle periods
    (during which RCU ignores batch limits), RCU can be forced into a
    state where it cannot keep up with the callback-generation rate,
    eventually resulting in OOM.
    
    This commit therefore converts a few variables in rcu_do_batch() from
    int to long to fix this problem, along with the module parameters
    controlling the batch limits.

    xhci: Extend Fresco Logic MSI quirk.
    
    commit bba18e33f25072ebf70fd8f7f0cdbf8cdb59a746 upstream.
    
    Ali reports that plugging a device into the Fresco Logic xHCI host with
    PCI device ID 1400 produces an IRQ error:
    
     do_IRQ: 3.176 No irq handler for vector (irq -1)
    
    Other early Fresco Logic host revisions don't support MSI, even though
    their PCI config space claims they do.  Extend the quirk to disabling
    MSI to this chipset revision.  Also enable the short transfer quirk,
    since it's likely this revision also has that quirk, and it should be
    harmless to enable.

    xhci: fix null-pointer dereference when destroying half-built segment rings
    
    commit 68e5254adb88bede68285f11fb442a4d34fb550c upstream.
    
    xhci_alloc_segments_for_ring() builds a list of xhci_segments and links
    the tail to head at the end (forming a ring). When it bails out for OOM
    reasons half-way through, it tries to destroy its half-built list with
    xhci_free_segments_for_ring(), even though it is not a ring yet. This
    causes a null-pointer dereference upon hitting the last element.
    
    Furthermore, one of its callers (xhci_ring_alloc()) mistakenly believes
    the output parameters to be valid upon this kind of OOM failure, and
    calls xhci_ring_free() on them. Since the (incomplete) list/ring should
    already be destroyed in that case, this would lead to a use after free.
    
    This patch fixes those issues by having xhci_alloc_segments_for_ring()
    destroy its half-built, non-circular list manually and destroying the
    invalid struct xhci_ring in xhci_ring_alloc() with a plain kfree().
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31, that

    xHCI: Fix TD Size calculation on 1.0 hosts.
    
    commit 4525c0a10dff7ad3669763c28016c7daffc3900e upstream.
    
    The xHCI 1.0 specification made a change to the TD Size field in TRBs.
    The value is now the number of packets that remain to be sent in the TD,
    not including this TRB.  The TD Size value for the last TRB in a TD must
    always be zero.
    
    The xHCI function xhci_v1_0_td_remainder() attempts to calculate this,
    but it gets it wrong.  First, it erroneously reuses the old
    xhci_td_remainder function, which will right shift the value by 10.  The
    xHCI 1.0 spec as of June 2011 says nothing about right shifting by 10.
    Second, it does not set the TD size for the last TRB in a TD to zero.
    
    Third, it uses roundup instead of DIV_ROUND_UP.  The total packet count
    is supposed to be the total number of bytes in this TD, divided by the
    max packet size, rounded up.  DIV_ROUND_UP is the right function to use
    in that case.
    
    With the old code, a TD on an endpoint with max packet size 1024 would
    be set up like so:
    TRB 1, TRB length = 600 bytes, TD size = 0
    TRB 1, TRB length = 200 bytes, TD size = 0
    TRB 1, TRB length = 100 bytes, TD size = 0
    
    With the new code, the TD would be set up like this:
    TRB 1, TRB length = 600 bytes, TD size = 1
    TRB 1, TRB length = 200 bytes, TD size = 1
    TRB 1, TRB length = 100 bytes, TD size = 0
    
    This commit should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, that contain

    static bool xhci_is_sync_in_ep(unsigned int ep_type)
    {
        return (ep_type == ISOC_IN_EP || ep_type == INT_IN_EP);

    genirq: Always force thread affinity
    
    commit 04aa530ec04f61875b99c12721162e2964e3318c upstream.
    
    Sankara reported that the genirq core code fails to adjust the
    affinity of an interrupt thread in several cases:
    
     1) On request/setup_irq() the call to setup_affinity() happens before
        the new action is registered, so the new thread is not notified.
    
     2) For secondary shared interrupts nothing notifies the new thread to
        change its affinity.
    
     3) Interrupts which have the IRQ_NO_BALANCE flag set are not moving
        the thread either.
    
    Fix this by setting the thread affinity flag right on thread creation
    time. This ensures that under all circumstances the thread moves to
    the right place. Requires a check in irq_thread_check_affinity for an
    existing affinity mask (CONFIG_CPU_MASK_OFFSTACK=y)

    USB: EHCI: bugfix: urb->hcpriv should not be NULL
    
    commit 2656a9abcf1ec8dd5fee6a75d6997a0f2fa0094e upstream.
    
    This patch (as1632b) fixes a bug in ehci-hcd.  The USB core uses
    urb->hcpriv to determine whether or not an URB is active; host
    controller drivers are supposed to set this pointer to a non-NULL
    value when an URB is queued.  However ehci-hcd sets it to NULL for
    isochronous URBs, which defeats the check in usbcore.
    
    In itself this isn't a big deal.  But people have recently found that
    certain sequences of actions will cause the snd-usb-audio driver to
    reuse URBs without waiting for them to complete.  In the absence of
    proper checking by usbcore, the URBs get added to their endpoint list
    twice.  This leads to list corruption and a system freeze.
    
    The patch makes ehci-hcd assign a meaningful value to urb->hcpriv for
    isochronous URBs.  Improving robustness always helps.

    config.  The existing code does this, but before storing the
    information about which endpoints were enabled!  As a result, any
    second attempt to install the new config is doomed to fail because
    xhci-hcd will refuse to enable an endpoint that is already enabled.
    
    The patch optimistically initializes the new endpoints' device
    structures before asking the device to switch to the new config.  If
    the request fails then the endpoint information is already stored, so
    we can use usb_hcd_alloc_bandwidth() to disable the endpoints with no
    trouble.  The rest of the error path is slightly more complex now; we
    have to disable the new interfaces and call put_device() rather than
    simply deallocating them.

    ARM: mm: use pteval_t to represent page protection values
    
    commit 864aa04cd02979c2c755cb28b5f4fe56039171c0 upstream.
    
    When updating the page protection map after calculating the user_pgprot
    value, the base protection map is temporarily stored in an unsigned long
    type, causing truncation of the protection bits when LPAE is enabled.
    This effectively means that calls to mprotect() will corrupt the upper
    page attributes, clearing the XN bit unconditionally.
    
    This patch uses pteval_t to store the intermediate protection values,
    preserving the upper bits for 64-bit descriptors.

    HPET_TN_FSB is not a proper mask bit; it merely toggles between MSI and

    usb: gadget: uvc: fix error path in uvc_function_bind()
    
    commit 0f9df939385527049c8062a099fbfa1479fe7ce0 upstream.
    
    The "video->minor = -1" assigment is done in V4L2 by
    video_register_device() so it is removed here.
    Now. uvc_function_bind() calls in error case uvc_function_unbind() for
    cleanup. The problem is that uvc_function_unbind() frees the uvc struct
    and uvc_bind_config() does as well in error case of usb_add_function().
    Removing kfree() in usb_add_function() would make the patch smaller but
    it would look odd because the new allocated memory is not cleaned up.
    However it is not guaranteed that if we call usb_add_function() we also
    get to the bind function.
    Therefore the patch extracts the conditional cleanup from
    uvc_function_unbind() applies to uvc_function_bind().
    uvc_function_unbind() now contains only the complete cleanup which is
    required once everything has been registrated.

    virtio: force vring descriptors to be allocated from lowmem
    
    commit b92b1b89a33c172c075edccf6afb0edc41d851fd upstream.
    
    Virtio devices may attempt to add descriptors to a virtqueue from atomic
    context using GFP_ATOMIC allocation. This is problematic because such
    allocations can fall outside of the lowmem mapping, causing virt_to_phys
    to report bogus physical addresses which are subsequently passed to
    userspace via the buffers for the virtual device.
    
    This patch masks out __GFP_HIGH and __GFP_HIGHMEM from the requested
    flags when allocating descriptors for a virtqueue. If an atomic
    allocation is requested and later fails, we will return -ENOSPC which
    will be handled by the driver.

    virtio: 9p: correctly pass physical address to userspace for high pages
    
    commit b9cdc88df8e63e81c723b82c286fc97f5d0dc325 upstream.
    
    When using a virtio transport, the 9p net device may pass the physical
    address of a kernel buffer to userspace via a scatterlist inside a
    virtqueue. If the kernel buffer is mapped outside of the linear mapping
    (e.g. highmem), then virt_to_page will return a bogus value and we will
    populate the scatterlist with junk.
    
    This patch uses kmap_to_page when populating the page array for a kernel
    buffer.

    freezer: add missing mb's to freezer_count() and freezer_should_skip()
    
    commit dd67d32dbc5de299d70cc9e10c6c1e29ffa56b92 upstream.
    
    A task is considered frozen enough between freezer_do_not_count() and
    freezer_count() and freezers use freezer_should_skip() to test this
    condition.  This supposedly works because freezer_count() always calls
    try_to_freezer() after clearing %PF_FREEZER_SKIP.
    
    However, there currently is nothing which guarantees that
    freezer_count() sees %true freezing() after clearing %PF_FREEZER_SKIP
    when freezing is in progress, and vice-versa.  A task can escape the
    freezing condition in effect by freezer_count() seeing !freezing() and
    freezer_should_skip() seeing %PF_FREEZER_SKIP.
    
    This patch adds smp_mb()'s to freezer_count() and
    freezer_should_skip() such that either %true freezing() is visible to
    freezer_count() or !PF_FREEZER_SKIP is visible to
    freezer_should_skip().

    cgroup: cgroup_subsys->fork() should be called after the task is added to css_set
    
    commit 5edee61edeaaebafe584f8fb7074c1ef4658596b upstream.
    
    cgroup core has a bug which violates a basic rule about event
    notifications - when a new entity needs to be added, you add that to
    the notification list first and then make the new entity conform to
    the current state.  If done in the reverse order, an event happening
    inbetween will be lost.
    
    cgroup_subsys->fork() is invoked way before the new task is added to
    the css_set.  Currently, cgroup_freezer is the only user of ->fork()
    and uses it to make new tasks conform to the current state of the
    freezer.  If FROZEN state is requested while fork is in progress
    between cgroup_fork_callbacks() and cgroup_post_fork(), the child
    could escape freezing - the cgroup isn't frozen when ->fork() is
    called and the freezer couldn't see the new task on the css_set.
    
    This patch moves cgroup_subsys->fork() invocation to
    cgroup_post_fork() after the new task is added to the css_set.
    cgroup_fork_callbacks() is removed.
    
    Because now a task may be migrated during cgroup_subsys->fork(),
    freezer_fork() is updated so that it adheres to the usual RCU locking
    and the rather pointless comment on why locking can be different there
    is removed (if it doesn't make anything simpler, why even bother?).

    s390/kvm: dont announce RRBM support
    
    commit 87cac8f879a5ecd7109dbe688087e8810b3364eb upstream.
    
    Newer kernels (linux-next with the transparent huge page patches)
    use rrbm if the feature is announced via feature bit 66.
    RRBM will cause intercepts, so KVM does not handle it right now,
    causing an illegal instruction in the guest.
    The  easy solution is to disable the feature bit for the guest.
    
    This fixes bugs like:

    tmpfs: fix shared mempolicy leak
    
    commit 18a2f371f5edf41810f6469cb9be39931ef9deb9 upstream.
    
    This fixes a regression in 3.7-rc, which has since gone into stable.
    
    Commit 00442ad04a5e ("mempolicy: fix a memory corruption by refcount
    imbalance in alloc_pages_vma()") changed get_vma_policy() to raise the
    refcount on a shmem shared mempolicy; whereas shmem_alloc_page() went
    on expecting alloc_page_vma() to drop the refcount it had acquired.
    This deserves a rework: but for now fix the leak in shmem_alloc_page().
    
    Hugh: shmem_swapin() did not need a fix, but surely it's clearer to use
    the same refcounting there as in shmem_alloc_page(), delete its onstack
    mempolicy, and the strange mpol_cond_copy() and __mpol_cond_copy() -
    those were invented to let swapin_readahead() make an unknown number of
    calls to alloc_pages_vma() with one mempolicy; but since 00442ad04a5e,
    alloc_pages_vma() has kept refcount in balance, so now no problem.

    These are real problems if lp5521_read() returns an error.  When that

    ARM: 7566/1: vfp: fix save and restore when running on pre-VFPv3 and CONFIG_VFPv3 set
    
    commit 39141ddfb63a664f26d3f42f64ee386e879b492c upstream.
    
    After commit 846a136881b8f73c1f74250bf6acfaa309cab1f2 ("ARM: vfp: fix
    saving d16-d31 vfp registers on v6+ kernels"), the OMAP 2430SDP board
    started crashing during boot with omap2plus_defconfig:
    
    [    3.875122] mmcblk0: mmc0:e624 SD04G 3.69 GiB
    [    3.915954]  mmcblk0: p1
    [    4.086639] Internal error: Oops - undefined instruction: 0 [#1] SMP ARM

    [    4.107666] LR is at __und_usr_fault_32+0x0/0x8
    
    It turns out that the context save/restore fix unmasked a latent bug
    in commit 5aaf254409f8d58229107b59507a8235b715a960 ("ARM: 6203/1: Make
    VFPv3 usable on ARMv6").  When CONFIG_VFPv3 is set, but the kernel is
    booted on a pre-VFPv3 core, the code attempts to save and restore the
    d16-d31 VFP registers.  These are only present on non-D16 VFPv3+, so
    this results in an undefined instruction exception.  The code didn't
    crash before commit 846a136 because the save and restore code was
    only touching d0-d15, present on all VFP.
    
    Fix by implementing a request from Russell King to add a new HWCAP
    flag that affirmatively indicates the presence of the d16-d31
    registers:
    
       http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=135013547905283&w=2
    
    and some feedback from Måns to clarify the name of the HWCAP flag.

    hwmon: (coretemp) Add support for Atom CE4110/4150/4170
    
    commit 1102dcab849313bd5a340b299b5cf61b518fbc0f upstream.
    
    TjMax for the CE4100 series of Atom CPUs was previously reported to be
    110 degrees C.
    
    cpuinfo logs on the web show existing CPU types CE4110, CE4150, and CE4170,
    reported as "model name : Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU CE41{1|5|7}0 @ 1.{2|6}0GHz"
    with model 28 (0x1c) and stepping 10 (0x0a). Add the three known variants
    to the tjmax table.

    workqueue: convert BUG_ON()s in __queue_delayed_work() to WARN_ON_ONCE()s
    
    commit fc4b514f2727f74a4587c31db87e0e93465518c3 upstream.
    
    8852aac25e ("workqueue: mod_delayed_work_on() shouldn't queue timer on
    0 delay") unexpectedly uncovered a very nasty abuse of delayed_work in
    megaraid - it allocated work_struct, casted it to delayed_work and
    then pass that into queue_delayed_work().
    
    Previously, this was okay because 0 @delay short-circuited to
    queue_work() before doing anything with delayed_work.  8852aac25e
    moved 0 @delay test into __queue_delayed_work() after sanity check on
    delayed_work making megaraid trigger BUG_ON().
    
    Although megaraid is already fixed by c1d390d8e6 ("megaraid: fix
    BUG_ON() from incorrect use of delayed work"), this patch converts
    BUG_ON()s in __queue_delayed_work() to WARN_ON_ONCE()s so that such
    abusers, if there are more, trigger warning but don't crash the
    machine.

    commit a51d4ed01e5bb39d2cf36a12f9976ab08872c192 upstream.
    
    This board is incorrectly detected as having an LVDS connector,
    resulting in the VGA output (the only available output on the board)
    showing the console only in the top-left 1024x768 pixels, and an extra
    LVDS connector appearing in X.
    
    It's a desktop Mini-ITX board using an Atom D525 CPU with an NM10
    chipset.
    
    I've had this board for about a year, but this is the first time I
    noticed the issue because I've been running it headless for most of its

    drm: give up on edid retries when i2c bus is not responding
    
    commit 9292f37e1f5c79400254dca46f83313488093825 upstream.
    
    This allows to avoid talking to a non-responding bus repeatedly until we
    finally timeout after 15 attempts. We can do this by catching the -ENXIO
    error, provided by i2c_algo_bit:bit_doAddress call.
    
    Within the bit_doAddress we already try 3 times to get the edid data, so
    if the routine tells us that bus is not responding, it is mostly pointless
    to keep re-trying those attempts over and over again until we reach final
    number of retries.
    
    This change should fix https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41059
    and improve overall edid detection timing by 10-30% in most cases, and by
    a much larger margin in case of phantom outputs (up to 30x in one worst
    case).
    
    Timing results for i915-powered machines for 'time xrandr' command:
    Machine 1: from 0.840s to 0.290s
    Machine 2: from 0.315s to 0.280s
    Machine 3: from +/- 4s to 0.184s
    
    Timing results for HD5770 with 'time xrandr' command:
    Machine 4: from 3.210s to 1.060s

    QEMU first retrieves the supported features via KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID
    and then sets them later. So guest's X86_FEATURE_XSAVE should be masked
    out on hosts without X86_FEATURE_XSAVE, making kvm_set_cr4 with
    X86_CR4_OSXSAVE fail. Userspaces that allow specifying guest cpuid with
    X86_FEATURE_XSAVE even on hosts that do not support it, might be
    susceptible to this attack from inside the guest as well.
    
    Allow setting X86_CR4_OSXSAVE bit only if host has XSAVE support.

    freezer: PF_FREEZER_NOSIG should be cleared along with PF_NOFREEZE
    
    This patch is only for pre-v3.3 stable trees which backported
    b40a7959 "freezer: exec should clear PF_NOFREEZE along with PF_KTHREAD".
    v3.3+ doesn't need this fix.
    
    b40a7959 is the trivial bugfix, but unfortunately I forgot that
    until 34b087e4 "freezer: kill unused set_freezable_with_signal()"
    there were another only-for-kernel-threads flag, PF_FREEZER_NOSIG,
    which should be cleared as well.
    
    See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/v86d/+bug/1080530
    The freezer fails because it expects that a PF_FREEZER_NOSIG task
    doesn't need a signal. Before b40a7959 it wrongly succeeds leaving
    the PF_NOFREEZE | PF_FREEZER_NOSIG task unfrozen.
