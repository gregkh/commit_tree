    hugetlb: fix resv_map leak in error path
    
    commit c50ac050811d6485616a193eb0f37bfbd191cc89 and
    4523e1458566a0e8ecfaff90f380dd23acc44d27 upstream.
    
    When called for anonymous (non-shared) mappings, hugetlb_reserve_pages()
    does a resv_map_alloc().  It depends on code in hugetlbfs's
    vm_ops->close() to release that allocation.
    
    However, in the mmap() failure path, we do a plain unmap_region() without
    the remove_vma() which actually calls vm_ops->close().
    
    This is a decent fix.  This leak could get reintroduced if new code (say,
    after hugetlb_reserve_pages() in hugetlbfs_file_mmap()) decides to return
    an error.  But, I think it would have to unroll the reservation anyway.
    
    Christoph's test case:

    mm: fix faulty initialization in vmalloc_init()
    
    commit dbda591d920b4c7692725b13e3f68ecb251e9080 upstream.
    
    The transfer of ->flags causes some of the static mapping virtual
    addresses to be prematurely freed (before the mapping is removed) because
    VM_LAZY_FREE gets "set" if tmp->flags has VM_IOREMAP set.  This might
    cause subsequent vmalloc/ioremap calls to fail because it might allocate
    one of the freed virtual address ranges that aren't unmapped.
    
    va->flags has different types of flags from tmp->flags.  If a region with
    VM_IOREMAP set is registered with vm_area_add_early(), it will be removed
    by __purge_vmap_area_lazy().
    
    Fix vmalloc_init() to correctly initialize vmap_area for the given
    vm_struct.
    
    Also initialise va->vm.  If it is not set, find_vm_area() for the early
    vm regions will always fail.

    e1000: save skb counts in TX to avoid cache misses
    
    commit 31c15a2f24ebdab14333d9bf5df49757842ae2ec upstream.
    
    Virtual Machines with emulated e1000 network adapter running on Parallels'
    server were seeing kernel panics due to the e1000 driver dereferencing an
    unexpected NULL pointer retrieved from buffer_info->skb.
    
    The problem has been addressed for the e1000e driver, but not for the e1000.
    Since the two drivers share similar code in the affected area, a port of the
    following e1000e driver commit solves the issue for the e1000 driver:

        In e1000_tx_map, precompute number of segements and bytecounts which
        are derived from fields in skb; these are stored in buffer_info.  When
        cleaning tx in e1000_clean_tx_irq use the values in the associated
        buffer_info for statistics counting, this eliminates cache misses
        on skb fields.

    fuse: fix stat call on 32 bit platforms
    
    commit 45c72cd73c788dd18c8113d4a404d6b4a01decf1 upstream.
    
    Now we store attr->ino at inode->i_ino, return attr->ino at the
    first time and then return inode->i_ino if the attribute timeout
    isn't expired. That's wrong on 32 bit platforms because attr->ino
    is 64 bit and inode->i_ino is 32 bit in this case.
    
    Fix this by saving 64 bit ino in fuse_inode structure and returning
    it every time we call getattr. Also squash attr->ino into inode->i_ino
    explicitly.

    iwlwifi: don't mess up the SCD when removing a key
    
    commit d6ee27eb13beab94056e0de52d81220058ca2297 upstream.
    
    When we remove a key, we put a key index which was supposed
    to tell the fw that we are actually removing the key. But
    instead the fw took that index as a valid index and messed
    up the SRAM of the device.
    
    This memory corruption on the device mangled the data of
    the SCD. The impact on the user is that SCD queue 2 got
    stuck after having removed keys.
    The message is the log that was printed is:
    
    Queue 2 stuck for 10000ms
    
    This doesn't seem to fix the higher queues that get stuck
    from time to time.

    It does not get processed because sched_domain_level_max is 0 at the

    the set_domain_attribute() routine prior to setting the sd->level, however,
    the set_domain_attribute() routine relies on the sd->level to decide whether
    idle load balancing will be off/on.

    can: c_can: fix race condition in c_can_open()
    
    commit f461f27a4436dbe691908fe08b867ef888848cc3 upstream.
    
    Fix the issue of C_CAN interrupts getting disabled forever when canconfig
    utility is used multiple times. According to NAPI usage we disable all
    the hardware interrupts in ISR and re-enable them in poll(). Current
    implementation calls napi_enable() after hardware interrupts are enabled.
    If we get any interrupts between these two steps then we do not process
    those interrupts because napi is not enabled. Mostly these interrupts
    come because of STATUS is not 0x7 or ERROR interrupts. If napi_enable()
    happens before HW interrupts enabled then c_can_poll() function will be
    called eventual re-enabling.
    
    This patch moves the napi_enable() call before interrupts enabled.

    can: c_can: fix an interrupt thrash issue with c_can driver
    
    commit 148c87c89e1a8863d3d965179f3ab1a06490569e upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an interrupt thrash issue with c_can driver.
    
    In c_can_isr() function interrupts are disabled and enabled only in
    c_can_poll() function. c_can_isr() & c_can_poll() both read the
    irqstatus flag. However, irqstatus is always read as 0 in c_can_poll()
    because all C_CAN interrupts are disabled in c_can_isr(). This causes
    all interrupts to be re-enabled in c_can_poll() which in turn causes
    another interrupt since the event is not really handled. This keeps
    happening causing a flood of interrupts.
    
    To fix this, read the irqstatus register in isr and use the same cached
    value in the poll function.

    can: c_can: fix "BUG! echo_skb is occupied!" during transmit
    
    commit 617caccebe451716df21c069b079d5936ed7b0f3 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an issue with transmit routine, which causes
    "can_put_echo_skb: BUG! echo_skb is occupied!" message when
    using "cansequence -p" on D_CAN controller.
    
    In c_can driver, while transmitting packets tx_echo flag holds
    the no of can frames put for transmission into the hardware.
    
    As the comment above c_can_do_tx() indicates, if we find any packet
    which is not transmitted then we should stop looking for more.
    In the current implementation this is not taken care of causing the
    said message.
    
    Also, fix the condition used to find if the packet is transmitted
    or not. Current code skips the first tx message object and ends up
    checking one extra invalid object.
    
    While at it, fix the comment on top of c_can_do_tx() to use the
    terminology "packet" instead of "package" since it is more
    standard.

    mac80211: clean up remain-on-channel on interface stop
    
    commit 71ecfa1893034eeb1c93e02e22ee2ad26d080858 upstream.
    
    When any interface goes down, it could be the one that we
    were doing a remain-on-channel with. We therefore need to
    cancel the remain-on-channel and flush the related work
    structs so they don't run after the interface has been
    removed or even destroyed.
    
    It's also possible in this case that an off-channel SKB
    was never transmitted, so free it if this is the case.
    Note that this can also happen if the driver finishes
    the off-channel period without ever starting it.

    powerpc: Fix kernel panic during kernel module load
    
    commit 3c75296562f43e6fbc6cddd3de948a7b3e4e9bcf upstream.
    
    This fixes a problem which can causes kernel oopses while loading
    a kernel module.
    
    According to the PowerPC EABI specification, GPR r11 is assigned
    the dedicated function to point to the previous stack frame.
    In the powerpc-specific kernel module loader, do_plt_call()
    (in arch/powerpc/kernel/module_32.c), GPR r11 is also used
    to generate trampoline code.
    
    This combination crashes the kernel, in the case where the compiler
    chooses to use a helper function for saving GPRs on entry, and the
    module loader has placed the .init.text section far away from the
    .text section, meaning that it has to generate a trampoline for
    functions in the .init.text section to call the GPR save helper.
    Because the trampoline trashes r11, references to the stack frame
    using r11 can cause an oops.
    
    The fix just uses GPR r12 instead of GPR r11 for generating the
    trampoline code.  According to the statements from Freescale, this is
    safe from an EABI perspective.
    
    I've tested the fix for kernel 2.6.33 on MPC8541.

    btree: fix tree corruption in btree_get_prev()
    
    commit cbf8ae32f66a9ceb8907ad9e16663c2a29e48990 upstream.
    
    The memory the parameter __key points to is used as an iterator in
    btree_get_prev(), so if we save off a bkey() pointer in retry_key and
    then assign that to __key, we'll end up corrupting the btree internals
    when we do eg
    
            longcpy(__key, bkey(geo, node, i), geo->keylen);
    
    to return the key value.  What we should do instead is use longcpy() to
    copy the key value that retry_key points to __key.
    
    This can cause a btree to get corrupted by seemingly read-only
    operations such as btree_for_each_safe.
