    net: disable netpoll on fresh napis
    
    [ Upstream commit 96e97bc07e90f175a8980a22827faf702ca4cb30 ]
    
    napi_disable() makes sure to set the NAPI_STATE_NPSVC bit to prevent
    netpoll from accessing rings before init is complete. However, the
    same is not done for fresh napi instances in netif_napi_add(),
    even though we expect NAPI instances to be added as disabled.
    
    This causes crashes during driver reconfiguration (enabling XDP,
    changing the channel count) - if there is any printk() after
    netif_napi_add() but before napi_enable().
    
    To ensure memory ordering is correct we need to use RCU accessors.

    sctp: not disable bh in the whole sctp_get_port_local()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3106ecb43a05dc3e009779764b9da245a5d082de ]
    
    With disabling bh in the whole sctp_get_port_local(), when
    snum == 0 and too many ports have been used, the do-while
    loop will take the cpu for a long time and cause cpu stuck:
    
      [ ] watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#11 stuck for 22s!
      [ ] RIP: 0010:native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x4de/0x940

    There's no need to disable bh in the whole function of
    sctp_get_port_local. So fix this cpu stuck by removing
    local_bh_disable() called at the beginning, and using
    spin_lock_bh() instead.
    
    The same thing was actually done for inet_csk_get_port() in
    Commit ea8add2b1903 ("tcp/dccp: better use of ephemeral
    ports in bind()").
    
    Thanks to Marcelo for pointing the buggy code out.
    
    v1->v2:
      - use cond_resched() to yield cpu to other tasks if needed,
        as Eric noticed.

    netlabel: fix problems with mapping removal
    
    [ Upstream commit d3b990b7f327e2afa98006e7666fb8ada8ed8683 ]
    
    This patch fixes two main problems seen when removing NetLabel
    mappings: memory leaks and potentially extra audit noise.
    
    The memory leaks are caused by not properly free'ing the mapping's
    address selector struct when free'ing the entire entry as well as
    not properly cleaning up a temporary mapping entry when adding new
    address selectors to an existing entry.  This patch fixes both these
    problems such that kmemleak reports no NetLabel associated leaks
    after running the SELinux test suite.
    
    The potentially extra audit noise was caused by the auditing code in
    netlbl_domhsh_remove_entry() being called regardless of the entry's
    validity.  If another thread had already marked the entry as invalid,
    but not removed/free'd it from the list of mappings, then it was
    possible that an additional mapping removal audit record would be
    generated.  This patch fixes this by returning early from the removal
    function when the entry was previously marked invalid.  This change
    also had the side benefit of improving the code by decreasing the
    indentation level of large chunk of code by one (accounting for most
    of the diffstat).

    affs: fix basic permission bits to actually work
    
    [ Upstream commit d3a84a8d0dde4e26bc084b36ffcbdc5932ac85e2 ]
    
    The basic permission bits (protection bits in AmigaOS) have been broken
    in Linux' AFFS - it would only set bits, but never delete them.
    Also, contrary to the documentation, the Archived bit was not handled.
    
    Let's fix this for good, and set the bits such that Linux and classic
    AmigaOS can coexist in the most peaceful manner.
    
    Also, update the documentation to represent the current state of things.

    ALSA; firewire-tascam: exclude Tascam FE-8 from detection
    
    Tascam FE-8 is known to support communication by asynchronous transaction
    only. The support can be implemented in userspace application and
    snd-firewire-ctl-services project has the support. However, ALSA
    firewire-tascam driver is bound to the model.
    
    This commit changes device entries so that the model is excluded. In a
    commit 53b3ffee7885 ("ALSA: firewire-tascam: change device probing
    processing"), I addressed to the concern that version field in
    configuration differs depending on installed firmware. However, as long
    as I checked, the version number is fixed. It's safe to return version
    number back to modalias.

    mm/hugetlb: fix a race between hugetlb sysctl handlers
    
    commit 17743798d81238ab13050e8e2833699b54e15467 upstream.
    
    There is a race between the assignment of `table->data` and write value
    to the pointer of `table->data` in the __do_proc_doulongvec_minmax() on
    the other thread.
    
      CPU0:                                 CPU1:

      hugetlb_sysctl_handler_common             hugetlb_sysctl_handler
        table->data = &tmp;                       hugetlb_sysctl_handler_common
                                                    table->data = &tmp;
          proc_doulongvec_minmax

                i = table->data;
                *i = val;  // corrupt CPU1's stack
    
    Fix this by duplicating the `table`, and only update the duplicate of
    it.  And introduce a helper of proc_hugetlb_doulongvec_minmax() to
    simplify the code.

    checkpatch: fix the usage of capture group ( ... )
    
    commit 13e45417cedbfc44b1926124b1846f5ee8c6ba4a upstream.
    
    The usage of "capture group (...)" in the immediate condition after `&&`
    results in `$1` being uninitialized.  This issues a warning "Use of
    uninitialized value $1 in regexp compilation at ./scripts/checkpatch.pl
    line 2638".
    
    I noticed this bug while running checkpatch on the set of commits from
    v5.7 to v5.8-rc1 of the kernel on the commits with a diff content in
    their commit message.
    
    This bug was introduced in the script by commit e518e9a59ec3
    ("checkpatch: emit an error when there's a diff in a changelog").  It
    has been in the script since then.
    
    The author intended to store the match made by capture group in variable
    `$1`.  This should have contained the name of the file as `[\w/]+`
    matched.  However, this couldn't be accomplished due to usage of capture
    group and `$1` in the same regular expression.
    
    Fix this by placing the capture group in the condition before `&&`.
    Thus, `$1` can be initialized to the text that capture group matches

    vfio/pci: Fix SR-IOV VF handling with MMIO blocking
    
    commit ebfa440ce38b7e2e04c3124aa89c8a9f4094cf21 upstream.
    
    SR-IOV VFs do not implement the memory enable bit of the command
    register, therefore this bit is not set in config space after
    pci_enable_device().  This leads to an unintended difference
    between PF and VF in hand-off state to the user.  We can correct
    this by setting the initial value of the memory enable bit in our
    virtualized config space.  There's really no need however to
    ever fault a user on a VF though as this would only indicate an
    error in the user's management of the enable bit, versus a PF
    where the same access could trigger hardware faults.

    net: initialize fastreuse on inet_inherit_port
    
    commit d76f3351cea2d927fdf70dd7c06898235035e84e upstream.
    
    In the case of TPROXY, bind_conflict optimizations for SO_REUSEADDR or
    SO_REUSEPORT are broken, possibly resulting in O(n) instead of O(1) bind
    behaviour or in the incorrect reuse of a bind.
    
    the kernel keeps track for each bind_bucket if all sockets in the
    bind_bucket support SO_REUSEADDR or SO_REUSEPORT in two fastreuse flags.
    These flags allow skipping the costly bind_conflict check when possible
    (meaning when all sockets have the proper SO_REUSE option).
    
    For every socket added to a bind_bucket, these flags need to be updated.
    As soon as a socket that does not support reuse is added, the flag is
    set to false and will never go back to true, unless the bind_bucket is
    deleted.
    
    Note that there is no mechanism to re-evaluate these flags when a socket
    is removed (this might make sense when removing a socket that would not
    allow reuse; this leaves room for a future patch).
    
    For this optimization to work, it is mandatory that these flags are
    properly initialized and updated.
    
    When a child socket is created from a listen socket in
    __inet_inherit_port, the TPROXY case could create a new bind bucket
    without properly initializing these flags, thus preventing the
    optimization to work. Alternatively, a socket not allowing reuse could
    be added to an existing bind bucket without updating the flags, causing
    bind_conflict to never be called as it should.
    
    Call inet_csk_update_fastreuse when __inet_inherit_port decides to create
    a new bind_bucket or use a different bind_bucket than the one of the
    listen socket.

    KVM: arm64: Set HCR_EL2.PTW to prevent AT taking synchronous exception
    
    commit 71a7f8cb1ca4ca7214a700b1243626759b6c11d4 upstream.
    
    AT instructions do a translation table walk and return the result, or
    the fault in PAR_EL1. KVM uses these to find the IPA when the value is
    not provided by the CPU in HPFAR_EL1.
    
    If a translation table walk causes an external abort it is taken as an
    exception, even if it was due to an AT instruction. (DDI0487F.a's D5.2.11
    "Synchronous faults generated by address translation instructions")
    
    While we previously made KVM resilient to exceptions taken due to AT
    instructions, the device access causes mismatched attributes, and may
    occur speculatively. Prevent this, by forbidding a walk through memory
    described as device at stage2. Now such AT instructions will report a
    stage2 fault.
    
    Such a fault will cause KVM to restart the guest. If the AT instructions
    always walk the page tables, but guest execution uses the translation cached
    in the TLB, the guest can't make forward progress until the TLB entry is
    evicted. This isn't a problem, as since commit 5dcd0fdbb492 ("KVM: arm64:
    Defer guest entry when an asynchronous exception is pending"), KVM will
    return to the host to process IRQs allowing the rest of the system to keep
    running.

    KVM: arm64: Survive synchronous exceptions caused by AT instructions
    
    commit 88a84ccccb3966bcc3f309cdb76092a9892c0260 upstream.
    
    KVM doesn't expect any synchronous exceptions when executing, any such
    exception leads to a panic(). AT instructions access the guest page
    tables, and can cause a synchronous external abort to be taken.
    
    The arm-arm is unclear on what should happen if the guest has configured
    the hardware update of the access-flag, and a memory type in TCR_EL1 that
    does not support atomic operations. B2.2.6 "Possible implementation
    restrictions on using atomic instructions" from DDI0487F.a lists
    synchronous external abort as a possible behaviour of atomic instructions
    that target memory that isn't writeback cacheable, but the page table
    walker may behave differently.
    
    Make KVM robust to synchronous exceptions caused by AT instructions.
    Add a get_user() style helper for AT instructions that returns -EFAULT
    if an exception was generated.
    
    While KVM's version of the exception table mixes synchronous and
    asynchronous exceptions, only one of these can occur at each location.
    
    Re-enter the guest when the AT instructions take an exception on the
    assumption the guest will take the same exception. This isn't guaranteed
    to make forward progress, as the AT instructions may always walk the page
    tables, but guest execution may use the translation cached in the TLB.
    
    This isn't a problem, as since commit 5dcd0fdbb492 ("KVM: arm64: Defer guest
    entry when an asynchronous exception is pending"), KVM will return to the
    host to process IRQs allowing the rest of the system to keep running.

    KVM: arm64: Defer guest entry when an asynchronous exception is pending
    
    commit 5dcd0fdbb492d49dac6bf21c436dfcb5ded0a895 upstream.
    
    SError that occur during world-switch's entry to the guest will be
    accounted to the guest, as the exception is masked until we enter the
    guest... but we want to attribute the SError as precisely as possible.
    
    Reading DISR_EL1 before guest entry requires free registers, and using
    ESB+DISR_EL1 to consume and read back the ESR would leave KVM holding
    a host SError... We would rather leave the SError pending and let the
    host take it once we exit world-switch. To do this, we need to defer
    guest-entry if an SError is pending.
    
    Read the ISR to see if SError (or an IRQ) is pending. If so fake an
    exit. Place this check between __guest_enter()'s save of the host
    registers, and restore of the guest's. SError that occur between
    here and the eret into the guest must have affected the guest's
    registers, which we can naturally attribute to the guest.
    
    The dsb is needed to ensure any previous writes have been done before
    we read ISR_EL1. On systems without the v8.2 RAS extensions this
    doesn't give us anything as we can't contain errors, and the ESR bits
    to describe the severity are all implementation-defined. Replace
    this with a nop for these systems.
    
    v4.9-backport: as this kernel version doesn't have the RAS support at
    all, remove the RAS alternative.

    KVM: arm64: Add kvm_extable for vaxorcism code
    
    commit e9ee186bb735bfc17fa81dbc9aebf268aee5b41e upstream.
    
    KVM has a one instruction window where it will allow an SError exception
    to be consumed by the hypervisor without treating it as a hypervisor bug.
    This is used to consume asynchronous external abort that were caused by
    the guest.
    
    As we are about to add another location that survives unexpected exceptions,
    generalise this code to make it behave like the host's extable.
    
    KVM's version has to be mapped to EL2 to be accessible on nVHE systems.
    
    The SError vaxorcism code is a one instruction window, so has two entries
    in the extable. Because the KVM code is copied for VHE and nVHE, we end up
    with four entries, half of which correspond with code that isn't mapped.

    vfio-pci: Invalidate mmaps and block MMIO access on disabled memory
    
    commit abafbc551fddede3e0a08dee1dcde08fc0eb8476 upstream.
    
    Accessing the disabled memory space of a PCI device would typically
    result in a master abort response on conventional PCI, or an
    unsupported request on PCI express.  The user would generally see
    these as a -1 response for the read return data and the write would be
    silently discarded, possibly with an uncorrected, non-fatal AER error
    triggered on the host.  Some systems however take it upon themselves
    to bring down the entire system when they see something that might
    indicate a loss of data, such as this discarded write to a disabled
    memory space.
    
    To avoid this, we want to try to block the user from accessing memory
    spaces while they're disabled.  We start with a semaphore around the
    memory enable bit, where writers modify the memory enable state and
    must be serialized, while readers make use of the memory region and
    can access in parallel.  Writers include both direct manipulation via
    the command register, as well as any reset path where the internal
    mechanics of the reset may both explicitly and implicitly disable
    memory access, and manipulation of the MSI-X configuration, where the
    MSI-X vector table resides in MMIO space of the device.  Readers
    include the read and write file ops to access the vfio device fd
    offsets as well as memory mapped access.  In the latter case, we make
    use of our new vma list support to zap, or invalidate, those memory
    mappings in order to force them to be faulted back in on access.
    
    Our semaphore usage will stall user access to MMIO spaces across
    internal operations like reset, but the user might experience new
    behavior when trying to access the MMIO space while disabled via the
    PCI command register.  Access via read or write while disabled will
    return -EIO and access via memory maps will result in a SIGBUS.  This
    is expected to be compatible with known use cases and potentially
    provides better error handling capabilities than present in the
    hardware, while avoiding the more readily accessible and severe
    platform error responses that might otherwise occur.

    vfio-pci: Fault mmaps to enable vma tracking
    
    commit 11c4cd07ba111a09f49625f9e4c851d83daf0a22 upstream.
    
    Rather than calling remap_pfn_range() when a region is mmap'd, setup
    a vm_ops handler to support dynamic faulting of the range on access.
    This allows us to manage a list of vmas actively mapping the area that
    we can later use to invalidate those mappings.  The open callback
    invalidates the vma range so that all tracking is inserted in the
    fault handler and removed in the close handler.

    libata: implement ATA_HORKAGE_MAX_TRIM_128M and apply to Sandisks
    
    commit 3b5455636fe26ea21b4189d135a424a6da016418 upstream.
    
    All three generations of Sandisk SSDs lock up hard intermittently.
    Experiments showed that disabling NCQ lowered the failure rate significantly
    and the kernel has been disabling NCQ for some models of SD7's and 8's,
    which is obviously undesirable.
    
    Karthik worked with Sandisk to root cause the hard lockups to trim commands
    larger than 128M. This patch implements ATA_HORKAGE_MAX_TRIM_128M which
    limits max trim size to 128M and applies it to all three generations of
    Sandisk SSDs.

    block: Move SECTOR_SIZE and SECTOR_SHIFT definitions into <linux/blkdev.h>
    
    commit 233bde21aa43516baa013ef7ac33f3427056db3e upstream.
    
    It happens often while I'm preparing a patch for a block driver that
    I'm wondering: is a definition of SECTOR_SIZE and/or SECTOR_SHIFT
    available for this driver? Do I have to introduce definitions of these
    constants before I can use these constants? To avoid this confusion,
    move the existing definitions of SECTOR_SIZE and SECTOR_SHIFT into the
    <linux/blkdev.h> header file such that these become available for all
    block drivers. Make the SECTOR_SIZE definition in the uapi msdos_fs.h
    header file conditional to avoid that including that header file after

    block: allow for_each_bvec to support zero len bvec
    
    commit 7e24969022cbd61ddc586f14824fc205661bb124 upstream.
    
    Block layer usually doesn't support or allow zero-length bvec. Since
    commit 1bdc76aea115 ("iov_iter: use bvec iterator to implement
    iterate_bvec()"), iterate_bvec() switches to bvec iterator. However,
    Al mentioned that 'Zero-length segments are not disallowed' in iov_iter.
    
    Fixes for_each_bvec() so that it can move on after seeing one zero
    length bvec.
    
    Fixes: 1bdc76aea115 ("iov_iter: use bvec iterator to implement iterate_bvec()")

    ALSA: firewire-digi00x: exclude Avid Adrenaline from detection
    
    commit acd46a6b6de88569654567810acad2b0a0a25cea upstream.
    
    Avid Adrenaline is reported that ALSA firewire-digi00x driver is bound to.
    However, as long as he investigated, the design of this model is hardly
    similar to the one of Digi 00x family. It's better to exclude the model
    from modalias of ALSA firewire-digi00x driver.
    
    This commit changes device entries so that the model is excluded.

    ALSA: pcm: oss: Remove superfluous WARN_ON() for mulaw sanity check
    
    commit 949a1ebe8cea7b342085cb6a4946b498306b9493 upstream.
    
    The PCM OSS mulaw plugin has a check of the format of the counter part
    whether it's a linear format.  The check is with snd_BUG_ON() that
    emits WARN_ON() when the debug config is set, and it confuses
    syzkaller as if it were a serious issue.  Let's drop snd_BUG_ON() for
    avoiding that.
    
    While we're at it, correct the error code to a more suitable, EINVAL.

    The problem is we're doing a copy_to_user() while holding tree locks,
    which can deadlock if we have to do a page fault for the copy_to_user().
    This exists even without my locking changes, so it needs to be fixed.
    Rework the search ioctl to do the pre-fault and then
    copy_to_user_nofault for the copying.

    uaccess: Add non-pagefault user-space write function
    
    [ Upstream commit 1d1585ca0f48fe7ed95c3571f3e4a82b2b5045dc ]
    
    Commit 3d7081822f7f ("uaccess: Add non-pagefault user-space read functions")
    missed to add probe write function, therefore factor out a probe_write_common()
    helper with most logic of probe_kernel_write() except setting KERNEL_DS, and
    add a new probe_user_write() helper so it can be used from BPF side.
    
    Again, on some archs, the user address space and kernel address space can
    co-exist and be overlapping, so in such case, setting KERNEL_DS would mean
    that the given address is treated as being in kernel address space.

    uaccess: Add non-pagefault user-space read functions
    
    [ Upstream commit 3d7081822f7f9eab867d9bcc8fd635208ec438e0 ]
    
    Add probe_user_read(), strncpy_from_unsafe_user() and
    strnlen_unsafe_user() which allows caller to access user-space
    in IRQ context.
    
    Current probe_kernel_read() and strncpy_from_unsafe() are
    not available for user-space memory, because it sets
    KERNEL_DS while accessing data. On some arch, user address
    space and kernel address space can be co-exist, but others
    can not. In that case, setting KERNEL_DS means given
    address is treated as a kernel address space.
    Also strnlen_user() is only available from user context since
    it can sleep if pagefault is enabled.
    
    To access user-space memory without pagefault, we need
    these new functions which sets USER_DS while accessing
    the data.

    btrfs: set the lockdep class for log tree extent buffers
    
    [ Upstream commit d3beaa253fd6fa40b8b18a216398e6e5376a9d21 ]
    
    These are special extent buffers that get rewound in order to lookup
    the state of the tree at a specific point in time.  As such they do not
    go through the normal initialization paths that set their lockdep class,
    so handle them appropriately when they are created and before they are
    locked.

    btrfs: Remove extraneous extent_buffer_get from tree_mod_log_rewind
    
    [ Upstream commit 24cee18a1c1d7c731ea5987e0c99daea22ae7f4a ]
    
    When a rewound buffer is created it already has a ref count of 1 and the
    dummy flag set. Then another ref is taken bumping the count to 2.
    Finally when this buffer is released from btrfs_release_path the extra
    reference is decremented by the special handling code in
    free_extent_buffer.
    
    However, this special code is in fact redundant sinca ref count of 1 is
    still correct since the buffer is only accessed via btrfs_path struct.
    This paves the way forward of removing the special handling in
    free_extent_buffer.

    btrfs: Remove redundant extent_buffer_get in get_old_root
    
    [ Upstream commit 6c122e2a0c515cfb3f3a9cefb5dad4cb62109c78 ]
    
    get_old_root used used only by btrfs_search_old_slot to initialise the
    path structure. The old root is always a cloned buffer (either via alloc
    dummy or via btrfs_clone_extent_buffer) and its reference count is 2: 1
    from allocation, 1 from extent_buffer_get call in get_old_root.
    
    This latter explicit ref count acquire operation is in fact unnecessary
    since the semantic is such that the newly allocated buffer is handed
    over to the btrfs_path for lifetime management. Considering this just
    remove the extra extent_buffer_get in get_old_root.

    This problem exists because we have two different rescan threads,
    btrfs_uuid_scan_kthread which creates the uuid tree, and
    btrfs_uuid_tree_iterate that goes through and updates or deletes any out
    of date roots.  The problem is they both do things in different order.
    btrfs_uuid_scan_kthread() reads the tree_root, and then inserts entries
    into the uuid_root.  btrfs_uuid_tree_iterate() scans the uuid_root, but
    then does a btrfs_get_fs_root() which can read from the tree_root.
    
    It's actually easy enough to not be holding the path in
    btrfs_uuid_scan_kthread() when we add a uuid entry, as we already drop
    it further down and re-start the search when we loop.  So simply move
    the path release before we add our entry to the uuid tree.
    
    This also fixes a problem where we're holding a path open after we do
    btrfs_end_transaction(), which has it's own problems.

    thermal: ti-soc-thermal: Fix bogus thermal shutdowns for omap4430
    
    [ Upstream commit 30d24faba0532d6972df79a1bf060601994b5873 ]
    
    We can sometimes get bogus thermal shutdowns on omap4430 at least with
    droid4 running idle with a battery charger connected:
    
    thermal thermal_zone0: critical temperature reached (143 C), shutting down
    
    Dumping out the register values shows we can occasionally get a 0x7f value
    that is outside the TRM listed values in the ADC conversion table. And then
    we get a normal value when reading again after that. Reading the register
    multiple times does not seem help avoiding the bogus values as they stay
    until the next sample is ready.
    
    Looking at the TRM chapter "18.4.10.2.3 ADC Codes Versus Temperature", we
    should have values from 13 to 107 listed with a total of 95 values. But
    looking at the omap4430_adc_to_temp array, the values are off, and the
    end values are missing. And it seems that the 4430 ADC table is similar
    to omap3630 rather than omap4460.
    
    Let's fix the issue by using values based on the omap3630 table and just
    ignoring invalid values. Compared to the 4430 TRM, the omap3630 table has
    the missing values added while the TRM table only shows every second
    value.
    
    Note that sometimes the ADC register values within the valid table can
    also be way off for about 1 out of 10 values. But it seems that those
    just show about 25 C too low values rather than too high values. So those
    do not cause a bogus thermal shutdown.

    iommu/vt-d: Serialize IOMMU GCMD register modifications
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e4e9ec65078093165463c13d4eb92b3e8d7b2e8 ]
    
    The VT-d spec requires (10.4.4 Global Command Register, GCMD_REG General
    Description) that:
    
    If multiple control fields in this register need to be modified, software
    must serialize the modifications through multiple writes to this register.
    
    However, in irq_remapping.c, modifications of IRE and CFI are done in one
    write. We need to do two separate writes with STS checking after each. It
    also checks the status register before writing command register to avoid
    unnecessary register write.

    tg3: Fix soft lockup when tg3_reset_task() fails.
    
    [ Upstream commit 556699341efa98243e08e34401b3f601da91f5a3 ]
    
    If tg3_reset_task() fails, the device state is left in an inconsistent
    state with IFF_RUNNING still set but NAPI state not enabled.  A
    subsequent operation, such as ifdown or AER error can cause it to
    soft lock up when it tries to disable NAPI state.
    
    Fix it by bringing down the device to !IFF_RUNNING state when
    tg3_reset_task() fails.  tg3_reset_task() running from workqueue
    will now call tg3_close() when the reset fails.  We need to
    modify tg3_reset_task_cancel() slightly to avoid tg3_close()
    calling cancel_work_sync() to cancel tg3_reset_task().  Otherwise
    cancel_work_sync() will wait forever for tg3_reset_task() to
    finish.

    dmaengine: pl330: Fix burst length if burst size is smaller than bus width
    
    [ Upstream commit 0661cef675d37e2c4b66a996389ebeae8568e49e ]
    
    Move the burst len fixup after setting the generic value for it. This
    finally enables the fixup introduced by commit 137bd11090d8 ("dmaengine:
    pl330: Align DMA memcpy operations to MFIFO width"), which otherwise was
    overwritten by the generic value.

    ravb: Fixed to be able to unload modules
    
    [ Upstream commit 1838d6c62f57836639bd3d83e7855e0ee4f6defc ]
    
    When this driver is built as a module, I cannot rmmod it after insmoding
    it.
    This is because that this driver calls ravb_mdio_init() at the time of
    probe, and module->refcnt is incremented by alloc_mdio_bitbang() called
    after that.
    Therefore, even if ifup is not performed, the driver is in use and rmmod
    cannot be performed.

    netfilter: nf_tables: fix destination register zeroing
    
    [ Upstream commit 1e105e6afa6c3d32bfb52c00ffa393894a525c27 ]
    
    Following bug was reported via irc:
    nft list ruleset
       set knock_candidates_ipv4 {
          type ipv4_addr . inet_service
          size 65535
          elements = { 127.0.0.1 . 123,
                       127.0.0.1 . 123 }
          }
     ..
       udp dport 123 add @knock_candidates_ipv4 { ip saddr . 123 }
       udp dport 123 add @knock_candidates_ipv4 { ip saddr . udp dport }
    
    It should not have been possible to add a duplicate set entry.
    
    After some debugging it turned out that the problem is the immediate
    value (123) in the second-to-last rule.
    
    Concatenations use 32bit registers, i.e. the elements are 8 bytes each,
    not 6 and it turns out the kernel inserted
    
    inet firewall @knock_candidates_ipv4
            element 0100007f ffff7b00  : 0 [end]
            element 0100007f 00007b00  : 0 [end]
    
    Note the non-zero upper bits of the first element.  It turns out that
    nft_immediate doesn't zero the destination register, but this is needed
    when the length isn't a multiple of 4.
    
    Furthermore, the zeroing in nft_payload is broken.  We can't use
    [len / 4] = 0 -- if len is a multiple of 4, index is off by one.
    
    Skip zeroing in this case and use a conditional instead of (len -1) / 4.

    batman-adv: Avoid uninitialized chaddr when handling DHCP
    
    [ Upstream commit 303216e76dcab6049c9d42390b1032f0649a8206 ]
    
    The gateway client code can try to optimize the delivery of DHCP packets to
    avoid broadcasting them through the whole mesh. But also transmissions to
    the client can be optimized by looking up the destination via the chaddr of
    the DHCP packet.
    
    But the chaddr is currently only done when chaddr is fully inside the
    non-paged area of the skbuff. Otherwise it will not be initialized and the
    unoptimized path should have been taken.
    
    But the implementation didn't handle this correctly. It didn't retrieve the
    correct chaddr but still tried to perform the TT lookup with this
    uninitialized memory.

    This event code can come from a variety of sources, including devices
    masquerading as input devices, only a bit more "programmable".
    
    Instead of taking the event code at face value, check that it actually
    fits the corresponding bitmap, and if it doesn't:
    - spit out a warning so that we know which device is acting up
    - NULLify the bitmap pointer so that we catch unexpected uses
    
    Code paths that can make use of untrusted inputs can now check
    that the mapping was indeed correct and bail out if not.

    HID: core: Correctly handle ReportSize being zero
    
    commit bce1305c0ece3dc549663605e567655dd701752c upstream.
    
    It appears that a ReportSize value of zero is legal, even if a bit
    non-sensical. Most of the HID code seems to handle that gracefully,
    except when computing the total size in bytes. When fed as input to
    memset, this leads to some funky outcomes.
    
    Detect the corner case and correctly compute the size.
