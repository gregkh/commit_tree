    kernel: make READ_ONCE() valid on const arguments
    
    [ Upstream commit dd36929720f40f17685e841ae0d4c581c165ea60 ]
    
    The use of READ_ONCE() causes lots of warnings witht he pending paravirt
    spinlock fixes, because those ends up having passing a member to a
    'const' structure to READ_ONCE().
    
    There should certainly be nothing wrong with using READ_ONCE() with a
    const source, but the helper function __read_once_size() would cause
    warnings because it would drop the 'const' qualifier, but also because
    the destination would be marked 'const' too due to the use of 'typeof'.
    
    Use a union of types in READ_ONCE() to avoid this issue.
    
    Also make sure to use parenthesis around the macro arguments to avoid
    possible operator precedence issues.

    KVM: VMX: Preserve host CR4.MCE value while in guest mode.
    
    [ Upstream commit 085e68eeafbf76e21848ad5bafaecec88a11dd64 ]
    
    The host's decision to enable machine check exceptions should remain
    in force during non-root mode.  KVM was writing 0 to cr4 on VCPU reset
    and passed a slightly-modified 0 to the vmcs.guest_cr4 value.
    
    Tested: Built.
    On earlier version, tested by injecting machine check
    while a guest is spinning.
    
    Before the change, if guest CR4.MCE==0, then the machine check is
    escalated to Catastrophic Error (CATERR) and the machine dies.
    If guest CR4.MCE==1, then the machine check causes VMEXIT and is
    handled normally by host Linux. After the change, injecting a machine
    check causes normal Linux machine check handling.

    x86: Store a per-cpu shadow copy of CR4
    
    [ Upstream commit 1e02ce4cccdcb9688386e5b8d2c9fa4660b45389 ]
    
    Context switches and TLB flushes can change individual bits of CR4.
    CR4 reads take several cycles, so store a shadow copy of CR4 in a
    per-cpu variable.
    
    To avoid wasting a cache line, I added the CR4 shadow to
    cpu_tlbstate, which is already touched in switch_mm.  The heaviest
    users of the cr4 shadow will be switch_mm and __switch_to_xtra, and
    __switch_to_xtra is called shortly after switch_mm during context
    switch, so the cacheline is likely to be hot.

    x86: Clean up cr4 manipulation
    
    [ Upstream commit 375074cc736ab1d89a708c0a8d7baa4a70d5d476 ]
    
    CR4 manipulation was split, seemingly at random, between direct
    (write_cr4) and using a helper (set/clear_in_cr4).  Unfortunately,
    the set_in_cr4 and clear_in_cr4 helpers also poke at the boot code,
    which only a small subset of users actually wanted.
    
    This patch replaces all cr4 access in functions that don't leave cr4
    exactly the way they found it with new helpers cr4_set_bits,
    cr4_clear_bits, and cr4_set_bits_and_update_boot.

    dmaengine: shdmac: avoid unused variable warnings
    
    [ Upstream commit 7d3beab16dd9eee86bb1a4dd05b51159fc7772f0 ]
    
    This driver uses '#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_SHMOBILE' and '#ifdef CONFIG_ARM'
    interchangeably in its sh_dmae_probe function, which causes a build
    warning when building for ARM without also enabling shmobile:
    
    dma/sh/shdmac.c: In function sh_dmae_probe:
    dma/sh/shdmac.c:696:6: warning: unused variable errirq [-Wunused-variable]
    dma/sh/shdmac.c:695:16: warning: unused variable irqflags [-Wunused-variable]
    dma/sh/shdmac.c: At top level:
    dma/sh/shdmac.c:447:20: warning: sh_dmae_err defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
    
    This changes all the #ifdef to test for CONFIG_ARCH_SHMOBILE to
    avoid that warning. An earlier patch from Laurent had fixed the warning
    for non-ARM case, but it still remained present in ARM randconfig builds.

    x86/efi: Store upper bits of command line buffer address in ext_cmd_line_ptr
    
    [ Upstream commit 98b228f55014870092c15d7d168fecac69f2f12a ]
    
    Until now, the EFI stub was only setting the 32 bit cmd_line_ptr in
    the setup_header structure, so on 64 bit platforms this could be truncated.
    This patch adds setting the upper bits of the buffer address in
    ext_cmd_line_ptr.  This case was likely never hit, as the allocation
    for this buffer is done at the lowest available address.  Only
    x86_64 kernels have this problem, as the 1-1 mapping mandated
    by EFI ensures that all memory is 32 bit addressable on 32 bit
    platforms.  The EFI stub does not support mixed mode, so the
    32 bit kernel on 64 bit firmware case does not need to be handled.

    mlx5: wrong page mask if CONFIG_ARCH_DMA_ADDR_T_64BIT enabled for 32Bit architectures
    
    [ Upstream commit 59d2d18cc4e9ba30b370db18d0e02d792699da96 ]
    
    If CONFIG_ARCH_DMA_ADDR_T_64BIT enabled for x86 systems and physical
    memory is more than 4GB, dma_map_page may return a valid memory
    address which greater than 0xffffffff. As a result, the mlx5 device page
    allocator RB tree will be initialized with valid addresses greater than
    0xfffffff.
    
    However, (addr & PAGE_MASK) set the high four bytes to zeros. So, it's
    impossible for the function, free_4k, to release the pages whose
    addresses greater than 4GB. Memory leaks. And mlx5_ib module can't
    release the pages when user try to remove the module, as a result,
    system hang.

    [media] Add and use IS_REACHABLE macro
    
    [ Upstream commit 9b174527e7b756cda9f5d9e541f87b7fec9cfdf0 ]
    
    In the media drivers, the v4l2 core knows about all submodules
    and calls into them from a common function. However this cannot
    work if the modules that get called are loadable and the
    core is built-in. In that case we get
    
    drivers/built-in.o: In function `set_type':
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:301: undefined reference to `tea5767_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:307: undefined reference to `tea5761_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:349: undefined reference to `tda9887_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:405: undefined reference to `xc4000_attach'
    
    This was working previously, until the IS_ENABLED() macro was used
    to replace the construct like
    
     #if defined(CONFIG_DVB_CX24110) || (defined(CONFIG_DVB_CX24110_MODULE) && defined(MODULE))
    
    with the difference that the new code no longer checks whether it is being
    built as a loadable module itself.
    
    To fix this, this new patch adds an 'IS_REACHABLE' macro, which evaluates
    true in exactly the condition that was used previously. The downside
    of this is that this trades an obvious link error for a more subtle
    runtime failure, but it is clear that the change that introduced the
    link error was unintentional and it seems better to revert it for
    now. Also, a similar change was originally created by Trent Piepho
    and then reverted by teh change to the IS_ENABLED macro.
    
    Ideally Kconfig would be used to avoid the case of a broken dependency,
    or the code restructured in a way to turn around the dependency, but either
    way would require much larger changes here.

    jhash: Update jhash_[321]words functions to use correct initval
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e7056c433216f406b90a003aa0ba42e19d3bdcf ]
    
    Looking over the implementation for jhash2 and comparing it to jhash_3words
    I realized that the two hashes were in fact very different.  Doing a bit of
    digging led me to "The new jhash implementation" in which lookup2 was
    supposed to have been replaced with lookup3.
    
    In reviewing the patch I noticed that jhash2 had originally initialized a
    and b to JHASH_GOLDENRATIO and c to initval, but after the patch a, b, and
    c were initialized to initval + (length << 2) + JHASH_INITVAL.  However the
    changes in jhash_3words simply replaced the initialization of a and b with
    JHASH_INITVAL.
    
    This change corrects what I believe was an oversight so that a, b, and c in
    jhash_3words all have the same value added consisting of initval + (length
    << 2) + JHASH_INITVAL so that jhash2 and jhash_3words will now produce the
    same hash result given the same inputs.

    Besides being currently limited to early demuxes only, commit
    a00e76349f35 forgot to add a check if we deal with full sockets,
    i.e. in this case not with time wait sockets. TCP time wait sockets
    do not have the same memory layout as full sockets, a lower memory
    footprint and consequently also don't have a sk_classid member;
    probing for sk_classid member there could potentially lead to a
    crash.

    Driver core: Unified device properties interface for platform firmware
    
    [ Upstream commit b31384fa5de37a100507751dfb5c0a49d06cee67 ]
    
    Add a uniform interface by which device drivers can request device
    properties from the platform firmware by providing a property name
    and the corresponding data type.  The purpose of it is to help to
    write portable code that won't depend on any particular platform
    firmware interface.
    
    The following general helper functions are added:
    
    device_property_present()
    device_property_read_u8()
    device_property_read_u16()
    device_property_read_u32()
    device_property_read_u64()
    device_property_read_string()
    device_property_read_u8_array()
    device_property_read_u16_array()
    device_property_read_u32_array()
    device_property_read_u64_array()
    device_property_read_string_array()
    
    The first one allows the caller to check if the given property is
    present.  The next 5 of them allow single-valued properties of
    various types to be retrieved in a uniform way.  The remaining 5 are
    for reading properties with multiple values (arrays of either numbers
    or strings).
    
    The interface covers both ACPI and Device Trees.
    
    This change set includes material from Mika Westerberg and Aaron Lu.

    ACPI: Add support for device specific properties
    
    [ Upstream commit ffdcd955c3078af3ce117edcfce80fde1a512bed ]
    
    Device Tree is used in many embedded systems to describe the system
    configuration to the OS. It supports attaching properties or name-value
    pairs to the devices it describe. With these properties one can pass
    additional information to the drivers that would not be available
    otherwise.
    
    ACPI is another configuration mechanism (among other things) typically
    seen, but not limited to, x86 machines. ACPI allows passing arbitrary
    data from methods but there has not been mechanism equivalent to Device
    Tree until the introduction of _DSD in the recent publication of the
    ACPI 5.1 specification.
    
    In order to facilitate ACPI usage in systems where Device Tree is
    typically used, it would be beneficial to standardize a way to retrieve
    Device Tree style properties from ACPI devices, which is what we do in
    this patch.
    
    If a given device described in ACPI namespace wants to export properties it
    must implement _DSD method (Device Specific Data, introduced with ACPI 5.1)
    that returns the properties in a package of packages. For example:
    
            Name (_DSD, Package () {
                    ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
                    Package () {
                            Package () {"name1", <VALUE1>},
                            Package () {"name2", <VALUE2>},
                            ...
                    }
            })
    
    The UUID reserved for properties is daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301
    and is documented in the ACPI 5.1 companion document called "_DSD
    Implementation Guide" [1], [2].
    
    We add several helper functions that can be used to extract these
    properties and convert them to different Linux data types.
    
    The ultimate goal is that we only have one device property API that
    retrieves the requested properties from Device Tree or from ACPI
    transparent to the caller.

    Commit c875d2c1 ("iommu/vt-d: Exclude devices using RMRRs from IOMMU API
    domains") prevents certain options for devices with RMRRs. This even
    prevents those devices from getting a 1:1 mapping with 'iommu=pt',
    because we don't have the code to handle *preserving* the RMRR regions
    when moving the device between domains.
    
    There's already an exclusion for USB devices, because we know the only
    reason for RMRRs there is a misguided desire to keep legacy
    keyboard/mouse emulation running in some theoretical OS which doesn't
    have support for USB in its own right... but which *does* enable the
    IOMMU.
    
    Add an exclusion for graphics devices too, so that 'iommu=pt' works
    there. We should be able to successfully assign graphics devices to
    guests too, as long as the initial handling of stolen memory is
    reconfigured appropriately. This has certainly worked in the past.

    HID: usbhid: Add a quirk for raphnet multi-gamepad adapters
    
    [ Upstream commit d6ea2f88ac3659b799d8079a4fbda4f8faf6ff90 ]
    
    The raphnet.net 4nes4snes and 2nes2snes multi-joystick adapters use a single
    HID report descriptor with one report ID per controller. This has the effect
    that the inputs of otherwise independent game controllers get packed in one
    large joystick device.
    
    With this patch each controller gets its own /dev/input/jsX device, which is
    more natural and less confusing than having all inputs going to the same place.

    HID: Introduce hidpp, a module to handle Logitech hid++ devices
    
    [ Upstream commit 2f31c52529103d8f0e1485272064f982d14ce54a ]
    
    Logitech devices use a vendor protocol to communicate various
    information with the device. This protocol is called HID++,
    and an exerpt can be found here:
    https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BxbRzx7vEV7eWmgwazJ3NUFfQ28&usp=shar
    
    The main difficulty which is related to this protocol is that
    it is a synchronous protocol using the input reports.
    So when we want to get some information from the device, we need
    to wait for a matching input report.
    
    This driver introduce this capabilities to be able to support
    the multitouch mode of the Logitech Wireless Touchpad T651
    (the bluetooth one). The multitouch data is available directly
    from the mouse input reports, and we just need to query the device
    on connect about its caracteristics.
    
    HID++ and the touchpad features has a specific reporting mode
    which uses pure HID++ reports, but Logitech told us not to use
    it for this specific device. During QA, they detected that
    some bluetooth input reports where lost, and so the only supported
    mode is the pointer mode.

    HID: uclogic: Set quirks from inside the driver
    
    [ Upstream commit 70b69cfb88467988116c4863056495fa3615271a ]
    
    Based on a patch from: Nikolai Kondrashov <Nikolai.Kondrashov@redhat.com>
    
    Most of the tablets handled by hid-uclogic already use MULTI_INPUT.
    For the ones which are not quirked in usbhid/hidquirks, they have a
    custom report descriptor which contains only one report per HID
    interface. For those tablets HID_QUIRK_MULTI_INPUT is transparent.
    
    According to https://github.com/DIGImend/tablets, the only problematic
    tablet currently handled by hid-uclogic is the TWHA60 v3. This tablet
    presents different report descriptors from the ones currently quirked.
    This is not a problem per se, given that this tablet is not supported
    currently in this version (it needs the same command as a Huion to
    start forwarding events).

    sched, numa: Do not hint for NUMA balancing on VM_MIXEDMAP mappings
    
    commit 8e76d4eecf7afeec9328e21cd5880e281838d0d6 upstream.
    
    Jovi Zhangwei reported the following problem
    
      Below kernel vm bug can be triggered by tcpdump which mmaped a lot of pages
      with GFP_COMP flag.

    In this case it was triggered by running tcpdump but it's not necessary
    reproducible on all systems.
    
      sudo tcpdump -i bond0.100 'tcp port 4242' -c 100000000000 -w 4242.pcap
    
    Compound pages cannot be migrated and it was not expected that such pages
    be marked for NUMA balancing.  This did not take into account that drivers
    such as net/packet/af_packet.c may insert compound pages into userspace
    with vm_insert_page.  This patch tells the NUMA balancing protection
    scanner to skip all VM_MIXEDMAP mappings which avoids the possibility that
    compound pages are marked for migration.

    crush: ensuring at most num-rep osds are selected
    
    [ Upstream commit 45002267e8d2699bf9b022315bee3dd13b044843 ]
    
    Crush temporary buffers are allocated as per replica size configured
    by the user.  When there are more final osds (to be selected as per
    rule) than the replicas, buffer overlaps and it causes crash.  Now, it
    ensures that at most num-rep osds are selected even if more number of
    osds are allowed by the rule.

    bridge: disable softirqs around br_fdb_update to avoid lockup
    
    [ Upstream commit c4c832f89dc468cf11dc0dd17206bace44526651 ]
    
    br_fdb_update() can be called in process context in the following way:
    br_fdb_add() -> __br_fdb_add() -> br_fdb_update() (if NTF_USE flag is set)
    so we need to disable softirqs because there are softirq users of the
    hash_lock. One easy way to reproduce this is to modify the bridge utility
    to set NTF_USE, enable stp and then set maxageing to a low value so
    br_fdb_cleanup() is called frequently and then just add new entries in
    a loop. This happens because br_fdb_cleanup() is called from timer/softirq
    context. The spin locks in br_fdb_update were _bh before commit f8ae737deea1
    ("[BRIDGE]: forwarding remove unneeded preempt and bh diasables")
    and at the time that commit was correct because br_fdb_update() couldn't be
    called from process context, but that changed after commit:
    292d1398983f ("bridge: add NTF_USE support")
    Using local_bh_disable/enable around br_fdb_update() allows us to keep
    using the spin_lock/unlock in br_fdb_update for the fast-path.

    [ Upstream commit e51000db4c880165eab06ec0990605f24e75203f ]
    
    There are several places in the driver (all in control paths) where
    coherent dma memory is being allocated using either dma_alloc_coherent()
    or the deprecated pci_alloc_consistent(). All these calls should be
    changed to use dma_zalloc_coherent() to avoid uninitialized fields in
    data structures backed by this memory.

    ipv4/udp: Verify multicast group is ours in upd_v4_early_demux()
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e540309326188f769e03bb4c6dd8ff6752930c2 ]
    
    421b3885bf6d56391297844f43fb7154a6396e12 "udp: ipv4: Add udp early
    demux" introduced a regression that allowed sockets bound to INADDR_ANY
    to receive packets from multicast groups that the socket had not joined.
    For example a socket that had joined 224.168.2.9 could also receive
    packets from 225.168.2.9 despite not having joined that group if
    ip_early_demux is enabled.
    
    Fix this by calling ip_check_mc_rcu() in udp_v4_early_demux() to verify
    that the multicast packet is indeed ours.

    xen: netback: read hotplug script once at start of day.
    
    [ Upstream commit 31a418986a5852034d520a5bab546821ff1ccf3d ]
    
    When we come to tear things down in netback_remove() and generate the
    uevent it is possible that the xenstore directory has already been
    removed (details below).
    
    In such cases netback_uevent() won't be able to read the hotplug
    script and will write a xenstore error node.
    
    A recent change to the hypervisor exposed this race such that we now
    sometimes lose it (where apparently we didn't ever before).
    
    Instead read the hotplug script configuration during setup and use it
    for the lifetime of the backend device.
    
    The apparently more obvious fix of moving the transition to
    state=Closed in netback_remove() to after the uevent does not work
    because it is possible that we are already in state=Closed (in
    reaction to the guest having disconnected as it shutdown). Being
    already in Closed means the toolstack is at liberty to start tearing
    down the xenstore directories. In principal it might be possible to
    arrange to unregister the device sooner (e.g on transition to Closing)
    such that xenstore would still be there but this state machine is
    fragile and prone to anger...
    
    A modern Xen system only relies on the hotplug uevent for driver
    domains, when the backend is in the same domain as the toolstack it
    will run the necessary setup/teardown directly in the correct sequence
    wrt xenstore changes.

    tcp: fix child sockets to use system default congestion control if not set
    
    [ Upstream commit 9f950415e4e28e7cfae2e416b43e862e8101d996 ]
    
    Linux 3.17 and earlier are explicitly engineered so that if the app
    doesn't specifically request a CC module on a listener before the SYN
    arrives, then the child gets the system default CC when the connection
    is established. See tcp_init_congestion_control() in 3.17 or earlier,
    which says "if no choice made yet assign the current value set as
    default". The change ("net: tcp: assign tcp cong_ops when tcp sk is
    created") altered these semantics, so that children got their parent
    listener's congestion control even if the system default had changed
    after the listener was created.
    
    This commit returns to those original semantics from 3.17 and earlier,
    since they are the original semantics from 2007 in 4d4d3d1e8 ("[TCP]:
    Congestion control initialization."), and some Linux congestion
    control workflows depend on that.
    
    In summary, if a listener socket specifically sets TCP_CONGESTION to
    "x", or the route locks the CC module to "x", then the child gets
    "x". Otherwise the child gets current system default from
    net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control. That's the behavior in 3.17 and
    earlier, and this commit restores that.

    udp: fix behavior of wrong checksums
    
    [ Upstream commit beb39db59d14990e401e235faf66a6b9b31240b0 ]
    
    We have two problems in UDP stack related to bogus checksums :
    
    1) We return -EAGAIN to application even if receive queue is not empty.
       This breaks applications using edge trigger epoll()
    
    2) Under UDP flood, we can loop forever without yielding to other
       processes, potentially hanging the host, especially on non SMP.
    
    This patch is an attempt to make things better.
    
    We might in the future add extra support for rt applications
    wanting to better control time spent doing a recv() in a hostile
    environment. For example we could validate checksums before queuing
    packets in socket receive queue.

    sctp: Fix mangled IPv4 addresses on a IPv6 listening socket
    
    [ Upstream commit 9302d7bb0c5cd46be5706859301f18c137b2439f ]
    
    sctp_v4_map_v6 was subtly writing and reading from members
    of a union in a way the clobbered data it needed to read before
    it read it.
    
    Zeroing the v6 flowinfo overwrites the v4 sin_addr with 0, meaning
    that every place that calls sctp_v4_map_v6 gets ::ffff:0.0.0.0 as the
    result.
    
    Reorder things to guarantee correct behaviour no matter what the
    union layout is.
    
    This impacts user space clients that open an IPv6 SCTP socket and
    receive IPv4 connections. Prior to 299ee user space would see a
    sockaddr with AF_INET and a correct address, after 299ee the sockaddr
    is AF_INET6, but the address is wrong.

    For mq qdisc, we add per tx queue qdisc to root qdisc
    for display purpose, however, that happens too early,
    before the new dev->qdisc is finally set, this causes
    q->list points to an old root qdisc which is going to be
    freed right before assigning with a new one.
    
    Fix this by moving ->attach() after setting dev->qdisc.

    xen/netback: Properly initialize credit_bytes
    
    [ Upstream commit ce0e5c522d3924090c20e774359809a7aa08c44c ]
    
    Commit e9ce7cb6b107 ("xen-netback: Factor queue-specific data into queue
    struct") introduced a regression when moving queue-specific data into
    the queue struct by failing to set the credit_bytes field. This
    prevented bandwidth limiting from working. Initialize the field as it
    was done before multiqueue support was added.

    A pair of nested spin locks was introduced in commit 63502b8d0
    "dp83640: Fix receive timestamp race condition".
    
    Unfortunately the 'flags' parameter was reused for the inner lock,

    by changing the inner lock to plain spin_lock without irqsave.

    [ Upstream commit 397a253af5031de4a4612210055935309af4472c ]
    
    Currently, the calibration function that corrects the initial offsets
    among multiple devices only works the first time.  If the function is
    called more than once, the calibration fails and bogus offsets will be
    programmed into the devices.
    
    In a well hidden spot, the device documentation tells that trigger indexes
    0 and 1 are special in allowing the TRIG_IF_LATE flag to actually work.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by using one of the special triggers during the
    recalibration method.

    bridge: fix parsing of MLDv2 reports
    
    [ Upstream commit 47cc84ce0c2fe75c99ea5963c4b5704dd78ead54 ]
    
    When more than a multicast address is present in a MLDv2 report, all but
    the first address is ignored, because the code breaks out of the loop if
    there has not been an error adding that address.
    
    This has caused failures when two guests connected through the bridge
    tried to communicate using IPv6. Neighbor discoveries would not be
    transmitted to the other guest when both used a link-local address and a
    static address.
    
    This only happens when there is a MLDv2 querier in the network.
    
    The fix will only break out of the loop when there is a failure adding a
    multicast address.
    
    The mdb before the patch:
    
    dev ovirtmgmt port vnet0 grp ff02::1:ff7d:6603 temp
    dev ovirtmgmt port vnet1 grp ff02::1:ff7d:6604 temp

    ipv4: Avoid crashing in ip_error
    
    [ Upstream commit 381c759d9916c42959515ad34a6d467e24a88e93 ]
    
    ip_error does not check if in_dev is NULL before dereferencing it.
    
    IThe following sequence of calls is possible:
    CPU A                          CPU B
    ip_rcv_finish
        ip_route_input_noref()
            ip_route_input_slow()
                                   inetdev_destroy()
        dst_input()
    
    With the result that a network device can be destroyed while processing
    an input packet.
    
    A crash was triggered with only unicast packets in flight, and
    forwarding enabled on the only network device.   The error condition
    was created by the removal of the network device.
    
    As such it is likely the that error code was -EHOSTUNREACH, and the
    action taken by ip_error (if in_dev had been accessible) would have
    been to not increment any counters and to have tried and likely failed
    to send an icmp error as the network device is going away.
    
    Therefore handle this weird case by just dropping the packet if
    !in_dev.  It will result in dropping the packet sooner, and will not
    result in an actual change of behavior.

    net: sched: fix call_rcu() race on classifier module unloads
    
    [ Upstream commit c78e1746d3ad7d548bdf3fe491898cc453911a49 ]
    
    Vijay reported that a loop as simple as ...
    
      while true; do
        tc qdisc add dev foo root handle 1: prio
        tc filter add dev foo parent 1: u32 match u32 0 0  flowid 1
        tc qdisc del dev foo root
        rmmod cls_u32
      done
    
    ... will panic the kernel. Moreover, he bisected the change
    apparently introducing it to 78fd1d0ab072 ("netlink: Re-add
    locking to netlink_lookup() and seq walker").
    
    The removal of synchronize_net() from the netlink socket
    triggering the qdisc to be removed, seems to have uncovered
    an RCU resp. module reference count race from the tc API.
    Given that RCU conversion was done after e341694e3eb5 ("netlink:
    Convert netlink_lookup() to use RCU protected hash table")
    which added the synchronize_net() originally, occasion of
    hitting the bug was less likely (not impossible though):
    
    When qdiscs that i) support attaching classifiers and,
    ii) have at least one of them attached, get deleted, they
    invoke tcf_destroy_chain(), and thus call into ->destroy()
    handler from a classifier module.
    
    After RCU conversion, all classifier that have an internal
    prio list, unlink them and initiate freeing via call_rcu()
    deferral.
    
    Meanhile, tcf_destroy() releases already reference to the
    tp->ops->owner module before the queued RCU callback handler
    has been invoked.
    
    Subsequent rmmod on the classifier module is then not prevented
    since all module references are already dropped.
    
    By the time, the kernel invokes the RCU callback handler from
    the module, that function address is then invalid.
    
    One way to fix it would be to add an rcu_barrier() to
    unregister_tcf_proto_ops() to wait for all pending call_rcu()s
    to complete.
    
    synchronize_rcu() is not appropriate as under heavy RCU
    callback load, registered call_rcu()s could be deferred
    longer than a grace period. In case we don't have any pending
    call_rcu()s, the barrier is allowed to return immediately.
    
    Since we came here via unregister_tcf_proto_ops(), there
    are no users of a given classifier anymore. Further nested
    call_rcu()s pointing into the module space are not being
    done anywhere.
    
    Only cls_bpf_delete_prog() may schedule a work item, to
    unlock pages eventually, but that is not in the range/context
    of cls_bpf anymore.

    Before the patch, the command 'ip link add bond2 type bond mode 802.3ad'

    x86 has variable length encoding. x86 JIT compiler is trying

    While doing so the jump targets are changing, so JIT is doing
    multiple passes over the program. Typical program needs 3 passes.
    Some very short programs converge with 2 passes. Large programs
    may need 4 or 5. But specially crafted bpf programs may hit the
    pass limit and if the program converges on the last iteration
    the JIT compiler will be producing an image full of 'int 3' insns.
    Fix this corner case by doing final iteration over bpf program.

    is already in the list of all upper devices for a given dev.
    This particular check seems to be a overzealous as it disallows
    perfectly valid configurations.  For example:
      # ip l a link eth0 name eth0.10 type vlan id 10
      # ip l a dev br0 typ bridge
      # ip l s eth0.10 master br0
      # ip l s eth0 master br0  <--- Will fail
    
    If you switch the last two commands (add eth0 first), then both
    will succeed.  If after that, you remove eth0 and try to re-add
    it, it will fail!
    
    It appears to be enough to simply check adj_list to keeps things
    safe.
    
    I've tried stacking multiple devices multiple times in all different
    combinations, and either rx_handler registration prevented the stacking
    of the device linking cought the error.

    ARM: 8221/1: PJ4: allow building in Thumb-2 mode
    
    Two files that get included when building the multi_v7_defconfig target
    fail to build when selecting THUMB2_KERNEL for this configuration.
    
    In both cases, we can just build the file as ARM code, as none of its
    symbols are exported to modules, so there are no interworking concerns.
    In the iwmmxt.S case, add ENDPROC() declarations so the symbols are
    annotated as functions, resulting in the linker to emit the appropriate
    mode switches.
