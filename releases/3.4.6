    timekeeping: Add missing update call in timekeeping_resume()
    
    This is a backport of 3e997130bd2e8c6f5aaa49d6e3161d4d29b43ab0
    
    The leap second rework unearthed another issue of inconsistent data.
    
    On timekeeping_resume() the timekeeper data is updated, but nothing
    calls timekeeping_update(), so now the update code in the timer
    interrupt sees stale values.
    
    This has been the case before those changes, but then the timer
    interrupt was using stale data as well so this went unnoticed for quite
    some time.
    
    Add the missing update call, so all the data is consistent everywhere.

    hrtimer: Update hrtimer base offsets each hrtimer_interrupt
    
    This is a backport of 5baefd6d84163443215f4a99f6a20f054ef11236
    
    The update of the hrtimer base offsets on all cpus cannot be made
    atomically from the timekeeper.lock held and interrupt disabled region
    as smp function calls are not allowed there.
    
    clock_was_set(), which enforces the update on all cpus, is called
    either from preemptible process context in case of do_settimeofday()
    or from the softirq context when the offset modification happened in
    the timer interrupt itself due to a leap second.
    
    In both cases there is a race window for an hrtimer interrupt between
    dropping timekeeper lock, enabling interrupts and clock_was_set()
    issuing the updates. Any interrupt which arrives in that window will
    see the new time but operate on stale offsets.
    
    So we need to make sure that an hrtimer interrupt always sees a
    consistent state of time and offsets.
    
    ktime_get_update_offsets() allows us to get the current monotonic time
    and update the per cpu hrtimer base offsets from hrtimer_interrupt()
    to capture a consistent state of monotonic time and the offsets. The
    function replaces the existing ktime_get() calls in hrtimer_interrupt().
    
    The overhead of the new function vs. ktime_get() is minimal as it just
    adds two store operations.
    
    This ensures that any changes to realtime or boottime offsets are
    noticed and stored into the per-cpu hrtimer base structures, prior to
    any hrtimer expiration and guarantees that timers are not expired early.

    timekeeping: Provide hrtimer update function
    
    This is a backport of f6c06abfb3972ad4914cef57d8348fcb2932bc3b
    
    To finally fix the infamous leap second issue and other race windows
    caused by functions which change the offsets between the various time
    bases (CLOCK_MONOTONIC, CLOCK_REALTIME and CLOCK_BOOTTIME) we need a
    function which atomically gets the current monotonic time and updates
    the offsets of CLOCK_REALTIME and CLOCK_BOOTTIME with minimalistic
    overhead. The previous patch which provides ktime_t offsets allows us
    to make this function almost as cheap as ktime_get() which is going to
    be replaced in hrtimer_interrupt().

    We need to update the hrtimer clock offsets from the hrtimer interrupt

    ktime_t based representation of those offsets in the timekeeper. This
    puts the conversion overhead into the code which updates the
    underlying offsets and provides fast accessible values in the hrtimer

    timekeeping: Fix leapsecond triggered load spike issue
    
    This is a backport of 4873fa070ae84a4115f0b3c9dfabc224f1bc7c51
    
    The timekeeping code misses an update of the hrtimer subsystem after a
    leap second happened. Due to that timers based on CLOCK_REALTIME are
    either expiring a second early or late depending on whether a leap
    second has been inserted or deleted until an operation is initiated
    which causes that update. Unless the update happens by some other
    means this discrepancy between the timekeeping and the hrtimer data
    stays forever and timers are expired either early or late.
    
    The reported immediate workaround - $ data -s "`date`" - is causing a
    call to clock_was_set() which updates the hrtimer data structures.
    See: http://www.sheeri.com/content/mysql-and-leap-second-high-cpu-and-fix
    
    Add the missing clock_was_set() call to update_wall_time() in case of
    a leap second event. The actual update is deferred to softirq context
    as the necessary smp function call cannot be invoked from hard
    interrupt context.

    hrtimer: Provide clock_was_set_delayed()
    
    This is a backport of f55a6faa384304c89cfef162768e88374d3312cb
    
    clock_was_set() cannot be called from hard interrupt context because
    it calls on_each_cpu().
    
    For fixing the widely reported leap seconds issue it is necessary to
    call it from hard interrupt context, i.e. the timer tick code, which
    does the timekeeping updates.
    
    Provide a new function which denotes it in the hrtimer cpu base
    structure of the cpu on which it is called and raise the hrtimer
    softirq. We then execute the clock_was_set() notificiation from
    softirq context in run_hrtimer_softirq(). The hrtimer softirq is
    rarely used, so polling the flag there is not a performance issue.

    will always happen at the right time.

    stmmac: Fix for nfs hang on multiple reboot
    
    commit 8e83989106562326bfd6aaf92174fe138efd026b upstream.
    
    It was observed that during multiple reboots nfs hangs. The status of
    receive descriptors shows that all the descriptors were in control of
    CPU, and none were assigned to DMA.
    Also the DMA status register confirmed that the Rx buffer is
    unavailable.
    
    This patch adds the fix for the same by adding the memory barriers to
    ascertain that the all instructions before enabling the Rx or Tx DMA are

    mac80211: destroy assoc_data correctly if assoc fails
    
    commit 10a9109f2705fdc3caa94d768b2559587a9a050c upstream.
    
    If association failed due to internal error (e.g. no
    supported rates IE), we call ieee80211_destroy_assoc_data()
    with assoc=true, while we actually reject the association.
    
    This results in the BSSID not being zeroed out.
    
    After passing assoc=false, we no longer have to call
    sta_info_destroy_addr() explicitly. While on it, move
    the "associated" message after the assoc_success check.

    rpmsg: fix dependency on initialization order
    
    commit 9634252617441991b01dacaf4040866feecaf36f upstream.
    
    When rpmsg drivers are built into the kernel, they must not initialize
    before the rpmsg bus does, otherwise they'd trigger a BUG() in
    drivers/base/driver.c line 169 (driver_register()).
    
    To fix that, and to stop depending on arbitrary linkage ordering of
    those built-in rpmsg drivers, we make the rpmsg bus initialize at
    subsys_initcall.

    iwlegacy: don't mess up the SCD when removing a key
    
    commit b48d96652626b315229b1b82c6270eead6a77a6d upstream.
    
    When we remove a key, we put a key index which was supposed
    to tell the fw that we are actually removing the key. But
    instead the fw took that index as a valid index and messed
    up the SRAM of the device.
    
    This memory corruption on the device mangled the data of
    the SCD. The impact on the user is that SCD queue 2 got
    stuck after having removed keys.

        iwlwifi: always monitor for stuck queues
    
        If we only monitor while associated, the following
        can happen:
         - we're associated, and the queue stuck check
           runs, setting the queue "touch" time to X
         - we disassociate, stopping the monitoring,
           which leaves the time set to X
         - almost 2s later, we associate, and enqueue
           a frame
         - before the frame is transmitted, we monitor
           for stuck queues, and find the time set to
           X, although it is now later than X + 2000ms,
           so we decide that the queue is stuck and
           erroneously restart the device

    rt2x00usb: fix indexes ordering on RX queue kick
    
    commit efd821182cec8c92babef6e00a95066d3252fda4 upstream.
    
    On rt2x00_dmastart() we increase index specified by Q_INDEX and on
    rt2x00_dmadone() we increase index specified by Q_INDEX_DONE. So entries
    between Q_INDEX_DONE and Q_INDEX are those we currently process in the
    hardware. Entries between Q_INDEX and Q_INDEX_DONE are those we can
    submit to the hardware.
    
    According to that fix rt2x00usb_kick_queue(), as we need to submit RX
    entries that are not processed by the hardware. It worked before only
    for empty queue, otherwise was broken.
    
    Note that for TX queues indexes ordering are ok. We need to kick entries
    that have filled skb, but was not submitted to the hardware, i.e.
    started from Q_INDEX_DONE and have ENTRY_DATA_PENDING bit set.
    
    From practical standpoint this fixes RX queue stall, usually reproducible
    in AP mode, like for example reported here:

    fifo: Do not restart open() if it already found a partner
    
    commit 05d290d66be6ef77a0b962ebecf01911bd984a78 upstream.
    
    If a parent and child process open the two ends of a fifo, and the
    child immediately exits, the parent may receive a SIGCHLD before its
    open() returns.  In that case, we need to make sure that open() will
    return successfully after the SIGCHLD handler returns, instead of
    throwing EINTR or being restarted.  Otherwise, the restarted open()
    would incorrectly wait for a second partner on the other end.
    
    The following test demonstrates the EINTR that was wrongly thrown from
    the parent’s open().  Change .sa_flags = 0 to .sa_flags = SA_RESTART
    to see a deadlock instead, in which the restarted open() waits for a
    second reader that will never come.  (On my systems, this happens
    pretty reliably within about 5 to 500 iterations.  Others report that
    it manages to loop ~forever sometimes; YMMV.)

      {
          struct sigaction act = {.sa_handler = handler, .sa_flags = 0};
          CHECK(sigaction(SIGCHLD, &act, NULL));
          CHECK(mknod("fifo", S_IFIFO | S_IRWXU, 0));
          for (;;) {
              int fd;

    sched/nohz: Rewrite and fix load-avg computation -- again
    
    commit 5167e8d5417bf5c322a703d2927daec727ea40dd upstream.
    
    Thanks to Charles Wang for spotting the defects in the current code:
    
     - If we go idle during the sample window -- after sampling, we get a
       negative bias because we can negate our own sample.
    
     - If we wake up during the sample window we get a positive bias
       because we push the sample to a known active period.
    
    So rewrite the entire nohz load-avg muck once again, now adding
    copious documentation to the code.

    cpufreq / ACPI: Fix not loading acpi-cpufreq driver regression
    
    commit c4686c71a9183f76e3ef59098da5c098748672f6 upstream.
    
    Commit d640113fe80e45ebd4a5b420b introduced a regression on SMP
    systems where the processor core with ACPI id zero is disabled
    (typically should be the case because of hyperthreading).
    The regression got spread through stable kernels.
    On 3.0.X it got introduced via 3.0.18.
    
    Such platforms may be rare, but do exist.
    Look out for a disabled processor with acpi_id 0 in dmesg:
    ACPI: LAPIC (acpi_id[0x00] lapic_id[0x10] disabled)
    
    This problem has been observed on a:
    HP Proliant BL280c G6 blade
    
    This patch restricts the introduced workaround to platforms
    with nr_cpu_ids <= 1.

    md/raid1: fix use-after-free bug in RAID1 data-check code.
    
    commit 2d4f4f3384d4ef4f7c571448e803a1ce721113d5 upstream.
    
    This bug has been present ever since data-check was introduce
    in 2.6.16.  However it would only fire if a data-check were
    done on a degraded array, which was only possible if the array
    has 3 or more devices.  This is certainly possible, but is quite
    uncommon.
    
    Since hot-replace was added in 3.3 it can happen more often as
    the same condition can arise if not all possible replacements are
    present.
    
    The problem is that as soon as we submit the last read request, the
    'r1_bio' structure could be freed at any time, so we really should
    stop looking at it.  If the last device is being read from we will
    stop looking at it.  However if the last device is not due to be read
    from, we will still check the bio pointer in the r1_bio, but the
    r1_bio might already be free.
    
    So use the read_targets counter to make sure we stop looking for bios
    to submit as soon as we have submitted them all.
    
    This fix is suitable for any -stable kernel since 2.6.16.

    mtd: nandsim: don't open code a do_div helper
    
    commit 596fd46268634082314b3af1ded4612e1b7f3f03 upstream.
    
    We don't need to open code the divide function, just use div_u64 that
    already exists and do the same job. While this is a straightforward
    clean up, there is more to that, the real motivation for this.
    
    While building on a cross compiling environment in armel, using gcc
    4.6.3 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5), I was getting the following build
    error:
    
    ERROR: "__aeabi_uldivmod" [drivers/mtd/nand/nandsim.ko] undefined!
    
    After investigating with objdump and hand built assembly version
    generated with the compiler, I narrowed __aeabi_uldivmod as being
    generated from the divide function. When nandsim.c is built with
    -fno-inline-functions-called-once, that happens when
    CONFIG_DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH is enabled, the do_div optimization in
    arch/arm/include/asm/div64.h doesn't work as expected with the open
    coded divide function: even if the do_div we are using doesn't have a
    constant divisor, the compiler still includes the else parts of the
    optimized do_div macro, and translates the divisions there to use
    __aeabi_uldivmod, instead of only calling __do_div_asm -> __do_div64 and
    optimizing/removing everything else out.
    
    So to reproduce, gcc 4.6 plus CONFIG_DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH=y and
    CONFIG_MTD_NAND_NANDSIM=m should do it, building on armel.
    
    After this change, the compiler does the intended thing even with
    -fno-inline-functions-called-once, and optimizes out as expected the
    constant handling in the optimized do_div on arm. As this also avoids a
    build issue, I'm marking for Stable, as I think is applicable for this
    case.

    and then Richard W.M.  Jones and Marcos Mello noted a few separate
    bugzillas also associated with the same issue.  This patch has been
    confirmed to fix:
    
        https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=835019
    
    The main problem is here, in __getblk_slow:
    
            for (;;) {
                    struct buffer_head * bh;
                    int ret;
    
                    bh = __find_get_block(bdev, block, size);
                    if (bh)
                            return bh;
    
                    ret = grow_buffers(bdev, block, size);
                    if (ret < 0)
                            return NULL;
                    if (ret == 0)
                            free_more_memory();
            }
    
    __find_get_block does not find the block, since it will not be marked as
    mapped, and so grow_buffers is called to fill in the buffers for the
    associated page.  I believe the for (;;) loop is there primarily to
    retry in the case of memory pressure keeping grow_buffers from
    succeeding.  However, we also continue to loop for other cases, like the
    block lying beond the end of the disk.  So, the fix I came up with is to
    only loop when grow_buffers fails due to memory allocation issues
    (return value of 0).
    
    The attached patch was tested by myself, Torsten, and Rich, and was
    found to resolve the problem in call cases.

    hwmon: (it87) Preserve configuration register bits on init
    
    commit 41002f8dd5938d5ad1d008ce5bfdbfe47fa7b4e8 upstream.
    
    We were accidentally losing one bit in the configuration register on
    device initialization. It was reported to freeze one specific system
    right away. Properly preserve all bits we don't explicitly want to
    change in order to prevent that.

    media: cx231xx: don't DMA to random addresses
    
    commit a7deca6fa79d5c65575532e780f3c93f6bf8ddad upstream.
    
    Commit 7a6f6c29d264cdd2fe0eb3d923217eed5f0ad134 (cx231xx: use
    URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP) was intended to avoid mapping the DMA buffer
    for URB twice. This works for the URBs allocated with usb_alloc_urb(),
    as those are allocated from cohernent DMA pools, but the flag was also
    added for the VBI and audio URBs, which have a manually allocated area.
    This leaves the random trash in the structure after allocation as the
    DMA address, corrupting memory and preventing VBI and audio from
    working. Letting the USB core map the buffers solves the problem.
