    netfilter: nft_exthdr: fix endianness of tcp option cast
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e34328b396a69b73661ba38d47d92b7cf21c2c4 ]
    
    I got a problem on MIPS with Big-Endian is turned on: every time when
    NF trying to change TCP MSS it returns because of new.v16 was greater
    than old.v16. But real MSS was 1460 and my rule was like this:
    
            add rule table chain tcp option maxseg size set 1400
    
    And 1400 is lesser that 1460, not greater.
    
    Later I founded that main causer is cast from u32 to __be16.
    
    Debugging:
    
    In example MSS = 1400(HEX: 0x578). Here is representation of each byte
    like it is in memory by addresses from left to right(e.g. [0x0 0x1 0x2
    0x3]). LE — Little-Endian system, BE — Big-Endian, left column is type.
    
                 LE               BE
            u32: [78 05 00 00]    [00 00 05 78]
    
    As you can see, u32 representation will be casted to u16 from different
    half of 4-byte address range. But actually nf_tables uses registers and
    store data of various size. Actually TCP MSS stored in 2 bytes. But
    registers are still u32 in definition:
    
            struct nft_regs {
                    union {
                            u32                     data[20];
                            struct nft_verdict      verdict;
                    };
            };
    
    So, access like regs->data[priv->sreg] exactly u32. So, according to
    table presents above, per-byte representation of stored TCP MSS in
    register will be:
    
                                 LE               BE
            (u32)regs->data[]:   [78 05 00 00]    [05 78 00 00]
                                                   ^^ ^^
    
    We see that register uses just half of u32 and other 2 bytes may be
    used for some another data. But in nft_exthdr_tcp_set_eval() it casted
    just like u32 -> __be16:
    
            new.v16 = src
    
    But u32 overfill __be16, so it get 2 low bytes. For clarity draw
    one more table(<xx xx> means that bytes will be used for cast).
    
                                 LE                 BE
            u32:                 [<78 05> 00 00]    [00 00 <05 78>]
            (u32)regs->data[]:   [<78 05> 00 00]    [05 78 <00 00>]
    
    As you can see, for Little-Endian nothing changes, but for Big-endian we
    take the wrong half. In my case there is some other data instead of
    zeros, so new MSS was wrongly greater.
    
    For shooting this bug I used solution for ports ranges. Applying of this
    patch does not affect Little-Endian systems.

    We've had CONFIG_MANDATORY_FILE_LOCKING since 2015 and a lot of distros

    locks: print a warning when mount fails due to lack of "mand" support
    
    [ Upstream commit df2474a22c42ce419b67067c52d71da06c385501 ]
    
    Since 9e8925b67a ("locks: Allow disabling mandatory locking at compile
    time"), attempts to mount filesystems with "-o mand" will fail.
    Unfortunately, there is no other indiciation of the reason for the
    failure.
    
    Change how the function is defined for better readability. When
    CONFIG_MANDATORY_FILE_LOCKING is disabled, printk a warning when
    someone attempts to mount with -o mand.
    
    Also, add a blurb to the mandatory-locking.txt file to explain about
    the "mand" option, and the behavior one should expect when it is
    disabled.

    ASoC: intel: atom: Fix breakage for PCM buffer address setup
    
    [ Upstream commit 65ca89c2b12cca0d473f3dd54267568ad3af55cc ]
    
    The commit 2e6b836312a4 ("ASoC: intel: atom: Fix reference to PCM
    buffer address") changed the reference of PCM buffer address to
    substream->runtime->dma_addr as the buffer address may change
    dynamically.  However, I forgot that the dma_addr field is still not
    set up for the CONTINUOUS buffer type (that this driver uses) yet in
    5.14 and earlier kernels, and it resulted in garbage I/O.  The problem
    will be fixed in 5.15, but we need to address it quickly for now.
    
    The fix is to deduce the address again from the DMA pointer with
    virt_to_phys(), but from the right one, substream->runtime->dma_area.

    btrfs: prevent rename2 from exchanging a subvol with a directory from different parents
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f79f6f6247c83f448c8026c3ee16d4636ef8d4f ]
    
    Cross-rename lacks a check when that would prevent exchanging a
    directory and subvolume from different parent subvolume. This causes
    data inconsistencies and is caught before commit by tree-checker,
    turning the filesystem to read-only.
    
    Calling the renameat2 with RENAME_EXCHANGE flags like
    
      renameat2(AT_FDCWD, namesrc, AT_FDCWD, namedest, (1 << 1))
    
    on two paths:
    
      namesrc = dir1/subvol1/dir2
     namedest = subvol2/subvol3
    
    will cause key order problem with following write time tree-checker

    [ Upstream commit 57a1681095f912239c7fb4d66683ab0425973838 ]
    
    The function tpci200_register called by tpci200_install and
    tpci200_unregister called by tpci200_uninstall are in pair. However,
    tpci200_unregister has some cleanup operations not in the
    tpci200_register. So the error handling code of tpci200_pci_probe has
    many different double free issues.
    
    Fix this problem by moving those cleanup operations out of
    tpci200_unregister, into tpci200_pci_remove and reverting
    the previous commit 9272e5d0028d ("ipack/carriers/tpci200:

    During suspend/resume NGD remote instance is power cycled along
    with remotely controlled bam dma engine.
    So Reset the dma configuration during this suspend resume path
    so that we are not dealing with any stale dma setup.
    
    Without this transactions timeout after first suspend resume path.

    slimbus: messaging: check for valid transaction id
    
    [ Upstream commit a263c1ff6abe0e66712f40d595bbddc7a35907f8 ]
    
    In some usecases transaction ids are dynamically allocated inside
    the controller driver after sending the messages which have generic
    acknowledge responses. So check for this before refcounting pm_runtime.
    
    Without this we would end up imbalancing runtime pm count by
    doing pm_runtime_put() in both slim_do_transfer() and slim_msg_response()
    for a single  pm_runtime_get() in slim_do_transfer()

    [ Upstream commit 9659281ce78de0f15a4aa124da8f7450b1399c09 ]
    
    As tid is unsigned its hard to figure out if the tid is valid or
    invalid. So Start the transaction ids from 1 instead of zero
    so that we could differentiate between a valid tid and invalid tids
    
    This is useful in cases where controller would add a tid for controller
    specific transfers.

    mmc: dw_mmc: Fix hang on data CRC error
    
    [ Upstream commit 25f8203b4be1937c4939bb98623e67dcfd7da4d1 ]
    
    When a Data CRC interrupt is received, the driver disables the DMA, then
    sends the stop/abort command and then waits for Data Transfer Over.
    
    However, sometimes, when a data CRC error is received in the middle of a
    multi-block write transfer, the Data Transfer Over interrupt is never
    received, and the driver hangs and never completes the request.
    
    The driver sets the BMOD.SWR bit (SDMMC_IDMAC_SWRESET) when stopping the
    DMA, but according to the manual CMD.STOP_ABORT_CMD should be programmed
    "before assertion of SWR".  Do these operations in the recommended
    order.  With this change the Data Transfer Over is always received
    correctly in my tests.

    net: mdio-mux: Handle -EPROBE_DEFER correctly
    
    [ Upstream commit 7bd0cef5dac685f09ef8b0b2a7748ff42d284dc7 ]
    
    When registering mdiobus children, if we get an -EPROBE_DEFER, we shouldn't
    ignore it and continue registering the rest of the mdiobus children. This
    would permanently prevent the deferring child mdiobus from working instead
    of reattempting it in the future. So, if a child mdiobus needs to be
    reattempted in the future, defer the entire mdio-mux initialization.
    
    This fixes the issue where PHYs sitting under the mdio-mux aren't
    initialized correctly if the PHY's interrupt controller is not yet ready
    when the mdio-mux is being probed. Additional context in the link below.

    The problem was in missing validation checks.
    
    Syzbot's reproducer generated malicious input, which caused

    rx_count_cooked is only 400 bytes and noone reported before,
    that 400 bytes is not enough, let's just check if input is malicious

    bnxt: don't lock the tx queue from napi poll
    
    [ Upstream commit 3c603136c9f82833813af77185618de5af67676c ]
    
    We can't take the tx lock from the napi poll routine, because
    netpoll can poll napi at any moment, including with the tx lock
    already held.
    
    The tx lock is protecting against two paths - the disable
    path, and (as Michael points out) the NETDEV_TX_BUSY case
    which may occur if NAPI completions race with start_xmit
    and both decide to re-enable the queue.
    
    For the disable/ifdown path use synchronize_net() to make sure
    closing the device does not race we restarting the queues.
    Annotate accesses to dev_state against data races.
    
    For the NAPI cleanup vs start_xmit path - appropriate barriers
    are already in place in the main spot where Tx queue is stopped
    but we need to do the same careful dance in the TX_BUSY case.

    cpufreq: armada-37xx: forbid cpufreq for 1.2 GHz variant
    
    [ Upstream commit 484f2b7c61b9ae58cc00c5127bcbcd9177af8dfe ]
    
    The 1.2 GHz variant of the Armada 3720 SOC is unstable with DVFS: when
    the SOC boots, the WTMI firmware sets clocks and AVS values that work
    correctly with 1.2 GHz CPU frequency, but random crashes occur once
    cpufreq driver starts scaling.
    
    We do not know currently what is the reason:
    - it may be that the voltage value for L0 for 1.2 GHz variant provided
      by the vendor in the OTP is simply incorrect when scaling is used,
    - it may be that some delay is needed somewhere,
    - it may be something else.
    
    The most sane solution now seems to be to simply forbid the cpufreq
    driver on 1.2 GHz variant.

    Bluetooth: hidp: use correct wait queue when removing ctrl_wait

    A different wait queue was used when removing ctrl_wait than when adding
    it. This effectively made the remove operation without locking compared
    to other operations on the wait queue ctrl_wait was part of. This caused
    issues like below where dead000000000100 is LIST_POISON1 and
    dead000000000200 is LIST_POISON2.

    scsi: core: Avoid printing an error if target_alloc() returns -ENXIO
    
    [ Upstream commit 70edd2e6f652f67d854981fd67f9ad0f1deaea92 ]
    
    Avoid printing a 'target allocation failed' error if the driver
    target_alloc() callback function returns -ENXIO. This return value
    indicates that the corresponding H:C:T:L entry is empty.
    
    Removing this error reduces the scan time if the user issues SCAN_WILD_CARD
    scan operation through sysfs parameter on a host with a lot of empty
    H:C:T:L entries.
    
    Avoiding the printk on -ENXIO matches the behavior of the other callback
    functions during scanning.

    The list_for_each_entry() iterator, "adapter" in this code, can never be
    NULL.  If we exit the loop without finding the correct adapter then
    "adapter" points invalid memory that is an offset from the list head.  This

    dmaengine: of-dma: router_xlate to return -EPROBE_DEFER if controller is not yet available
    
    [ Upstream commit eda97cb095f2958bbad55684a6ca3e7d7af0176a ]
    
    If the router_xlate can not find the controller in the available DMA
    devices then it should return with -EPORBE_DEFER in a same way as the
    of_dma_request_slave_channel() does.
    
    The issue can be reproduced if the event router is registered before the
    DMA controller itself and a driver would request for a channel before the
    controller is registered.
    In of_dma_request_slave_channel():
    1. of_dma_find_controller() would find the dma_router
    2. ofdma->of_dma_xlate() would fail and returned NULL
    3. -ENODEV is returned as error code
    
    with this patch we would return in this case the correct -EPROBE_DEFER and
    the client can try to request the channel later.

    ARM: dts: am43x-epos-evm: Reduce i2c0 bus speed for tps65218
    
    [ Upstream commit 20a6b3fd8e2e2c063b25fbf2ee74d86b898e5087 ]
    
    Based on the latest timing specifications for the TPS65218 from the data
    sheet, http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps65218.pdf, document SLDS206
    from November 2014, we must change the i2c bus speed to better fit within
    the minimum high SCL time required for proper i2c transfer.
    
    When running at 400khz, measurements show that SCL spends
    0.8125 uS/1.666 uS high/low which violates the requirement for minimum
    high period of SCL provided in datasheet Table 7.6 which is 1 uS.
    Switching to 100khz gives us 5 uS/5 uS high/low which both fall above
    the minimum given values for 100 khz, 4.0 uS/4.7 uS high/low.
    
    Without this patch occasionally a voltage set operation from the kernel
    will appear to have worked but the actual voltage reflected on the PMIC
    will not have updated, causing problems especially with cpufreq that may
    update to a higher OPP without actually raising the voltage on DCDC2,
    leading to a hang.

    dmaengine: xilinx_dma: Fix read-after-free bug when terminating transfers
    
    [ Upstream commit 7dd2dd4ff9f3abda601f22b9d01441a0869d20d7 ]
    
    When user calls dmaengine_terminate_sync, the driver will clean up any
    remaining descriptors for all the pending or active transfers that had
    previously been submitted. However, this might happen whilst the tasklet is
    invoking the DMA callback for the last finished transfer, so by the time it
    returns and takes over the channel's spinlock, the list of completed
    descriptors it was traversing is no longer valid. This leads to a
    read-after-free situation.
    
    Fix it by signalling whether a user-triggered termination has happened by
    means of a boolean variable.

    ath9k: Postpone key cache entry deletion for TXQ frames reference it
    
    commit ca2848022c12789685d3fab3227df02b863f9696 upstream.
    
    Do not delete a key cache entry that is still being referenced by
    pending frames in TXQs. This avoids reuse of the key cache entry while a
    frame might still be transmitted using it.
    
    To avoid having to do any additional operations during the main TX path
    operations, track pending key cache entries in a new bitmap and check
    whether any pending entries can be deleted before every new key
    add/remove operation. Also clear any remaining entries when stopping the
    interface.

    ath: Modify ath_key_delete() to not need full key entry
    
    commit 144cd24dbc36650a51f7fe3bf1424a1432f1f480 upstream.
    
    tkip_keymap can be used internally to avoid the reference to key->cipher
    and with this, only the key index value itself is needed. This allows
    ath_key_delete() call to be postponed to be handled after the upper
    layer STA and key entry have already been removed. This is needed to
    make ath9k key cache management safer.

    ath: Use safer key clearing with key cache entries
    
    commit 56c5485c9e444c2e85e11694b6c44f1338fc20fd upstream.
    
    It is possible for there to be pending frames in TXQs with a reference
    to the key cache entry that is being deleted. If such a key cache entry
    is cleared, those pending frame in TXQ might get transmitted without
    proper encryption. It is safer to leave the previously used key into the
    key cache in such cases. Instead, only clear the MAC address to prevent
    RX processing from using this key cache entry.
    
    This is needed in particularly in AP mode where the TXQs cannot be
    flushed on station disconnection. This change alone may not be able to
    address all cases where the key cache entry might get reused for other
    purposes immediately (the key cache entry should be released for reuse
    only once the TXQs do not have any remaining references to them), but
    this makes it less likely to get unprotected frames and the more
    complete changes may end up being significantly more complex.

    x86/fpu: Make init_fpstate correct with optimized XSAVE
    
    commit f9dfb5e390fab2df9f7944bb91e7705aba14cd26 upstream.
    
    The XSAVE init code initializes all enabled and supported components with
    XRSTOR(S) to init state. Then it XSAVEs the state of the components back
    into init_fpstate which is used in several places to fill in the init state
    of components.
    
    This works correctly with XSAVE, but not with XSAVEOPT and XSAVES because
    those use the init optimization and skip writing state of components which
    are in init state. So init_fpstate.xsave still contains all zeroes after
    this operation.
    
    There are two ways to solve that:
    
       1) Use XSAVE unconditionally, but that requires to reshuffle the buffer when
          XSAVES is enabled because XSAVES uses compacted format.
    
       2) Save the components which are known to have a non-zero init state by other
          means.
    
    Looking deeper, #2 is the right thing to do because all components the
    kernel supports have all-zeroes init state except the legacy features (FP,
    SSE). Those cannot be hard coded because the states are not identical on all
    CPUs, but they can be saved with FXSAVE which avoids all conditionals.
    
    Use FXSAVE to save the legacy FP/SSE components in init_fpstate along with
    a BUILD_BUG_ON() which reminds developers to validate that a newly added
    component has all zeroes init state. As a bonus remove the now unused
    copy_xregs_to_kernel_booting() crutch.
    
    The XSAVE and reshuffle method can still be implemented in the unlikely
    case that components are added which have a non-zero init state and no
    other means to save them. For now, FXSAVE is just simple and good enough.

    Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE (currently not supported for the nested hypervisor),

    mac80211: drop data frames without key on encrypted links
    
    commit a0761a301746ec2d92d7fcb82af69c0a6a4339aa upstream.
    
    If we know that we have an encrypted link (based on having had
    a key configured for TX in the past) then drop all data frames
    in the key selection handler if there's no key anymore.
    
    This fixes an issue with mac80211 internal TXQs - there we can
    buffer frames for an encrypted link, but then if the key is no
    longer there when they're dequeued, the frames are sent without
    encryption. This happens if a station is disconnected while the
    frames are still on the TXQ.
    
    Detecting that a link should be encrypted based on a first key
    having been configured for TX is fine as there are no use cases
    for a connection going from with encryption to no encryption.
    With extended key IDs, however, there is a case of having a key
    configured for only decryption, so we can't just trigger this
    behaviour on a key being configured.

    iommu/vt-d: Fix agaw for a supported 48 bit guest address width
    
    [ Upstream commit 327d5b2fee91c404a3956c324193892cf2cc9528 ]
    
    The IOMMU driver calculates the guest addressability for a DMA request
    based on the value of the mgaw reported from the IOMMU. However, this
    is a fused value and as mentioned in the spec, the guest width
    should be calculated based on the minimum of supported adjusted guest
    address width (SAGAW) and MGAW.
    
    This is from specification:
    "Guest addressability for a given DMA request is limited to the
    minimum of the value reported through this field and the adjusted
    guest address width of the corresponding page-table structure.
    (Adjusted guest address widths supported by hardware are reported
    through the SAGAW field)."
    
    This causes domain initialization to fail and following
    errors appear for EHCI PCI driver:
    
    [    2.486393] ehci-pci 0000:01:00.4: EHCI Host Controller
    [    2.486624] ehci-pci 0000:01:00.4: new USB bus registered, assigned bus
    number 1
    [    2.489127] ehci-pci 0000:01:00.4: DMAR: Allocating domain failed
    [    2.489350] ehci-pci 0000:01:00.4: DMAR: 32bit DMA uses non-identity
    mapping
    [    2.489359] ehci-pci 0000:01:00.4: can't setup: -12
    [    2.489531] ehci-pci 0000:01:00.4: USB bus 1 deregistered
    [    2.490023] ehci-pci 0000:01:00.4: init 0000:01:00.4 fail, -12
    [    2.490358] ehci-pci: probe of 0000:01:00.4 failed with error -12
    
    This issue happens when the value of the sagaw corresponds to a
    48-bit agaw. This fix updates the calculation of the agaw based on
    the minimum of IOMMU's sagaw value and MGAW.
    
    This issue happens on the code path of getting a private domain for a
    device. A private domain was needed when the domain of an iommu group
    couldn't meet the requirement of a device. The IOMMU core has been
    evolved to eliminate the need for private domain, hence this code path
    has alreay been removed from the upstream since commit 327d5b2fee91c
    ("iommu/vt-d: Allow 32bit devices to uses DMA domain"). Instead of back
    porting all patches that are required for removing the private domain,
    this simply fixes it in the affected stable kernel between v4.16 and v5.7.

    vmlinux.lds.h: Handle clang's module.{c,d}tor sections
    
    commit 848378812e40152abe9b9baf58ce2004f76fb988 upstream.
    
    A recent change in LLVM causes module_{c,d}tor sections to appear when
    CONFIG_K{A,C}SAN are enabled, which results in orphan section warnings
    because these are not handled anywhere:
    
    ld.lld: warning: arch/x86/pci/built-in.a(legacy.o):(.text.asan.module_ctor) is being placed in '.text.asan.module_ctor'
    ld.lld: warning: arch/x86/pci/built-in.a(legacy.o):(.text.asan.module_dtor) is being placed in '.text.asan.module_dtor'
    ld.lld: warning: arch/x86/pci/built-in.a(legacy.o):(.text.tsan.module_ctor) is being placed in '.text.tsan.module_ctor'
    
    Fangrui explains: "the function asan.module_ctor has the SHF_GNU_RETAIN
    flag, so it is in a separate section even with -fno-function-sections
    (default)".
    
    Place them in the TEXT_TEXT section so that these technologies continue
    to work with the newer compiler versions. All of the KASAN and KCSAN
    KUnit tests continue to pass after this change.

    PCI/MSI: Enforce MSI[X] entry updates to be visible
    
    commit b9255a7cb51754e8d2645b65dd31805e282b4f3e upstream.
    
    Nothing enforces the posted writes to be visible when the function
    returns. Flush them even if the flush might be redundant when the entry is
    masked already as the unmask will flush as well. This is either setup or a
    rare affinity change event so the extra flush is not the end of the world.
    
    While this is more a theoretical issue especially the logic in the X86
    specific msi_set_affinity() function relies on the assumption that the
    update has reached the hardware when the function returns.
    
    Again, as this never has been enforced the Fixes tag refers to a commit in:
       git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git

    PCI/MSI: Enforce that MSI-X table entry is masked for update
    
    commit da181dc974ad667579baece33c2c8d2d1e4558d5 upstream.
    
    The specification (PCIe r5.0, sec 6.1.4.5) states:
    
        For MSI-X, a function is permitted to cache Address and Data values
        from unmasked MSI-X Table entries. However, anytime software unmasks a
        currently masked MSI-X Table entry either by clearing its Mask bit or
        by clearing the Function Mask bit, the function must update any Address
        or Data values that it cached from that entry. If software changes the
        Address or Data value of an entry while the entry is unmasked, the
        result is undefined.
    
    The Linux kernel's MSI-X support never enforced that the entry is masked
    before the entry is modified hence the Fixes tag refers to a commit in:
          git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git
    
    Enforce the entry to be masked across the update.
    
    There is no point in enforcing this to be handled at all possible call
    sites as this is just pointless code duplication and the common update
    function is the obvious place to enforce this.

      pci_msi_setup_msi_irqs();
      msix_program_entries();
    
    This has a few interesting issues:
    
     1) msix_setup_entries() allocates the MSI descriptors and initializes them
        except for the msi_desc:masked member which is left zero initialized.
    
     2) pci_msi_setup_msi_irqs() allocates the interrupt descriptors and sets
        up the MSI interrupts which ends up in pci_write_msi_msg() unless the
        interrupt chip provides its own irq_write_msi_msg() function.
    
     3) msix_program_entries() does not do what the name suggests. It solely
        updates the entries array (if not NULL) and initializes the masked
        member for each MSI descriptor by reading the hardware state and then
        masks the entry.
    
    Obviously this has some issues:
    
     1) The uninitialized masked member of msi_desc prevents the enforcement
        of masking the entry in pci_write_msi_msg() depending on the cached
        masked bit. Aside of that half initialized data is a NONO in general
    
     2) msix_program_entries() only ensures that the actually allocated entries
        are masked. This is wrong as experimentation with crash testing and
        crash kernel kexec has shown.
    
        This limited testing unearthed that when the production kernel had more
        entries in use and unmasked when it crashed and the crash kernel
        allocated a smaller amount of entries, then a full scan of all entries
        found unmasked entries which were in use in the production kernel.
    
        This is obviously a device or emulation issue as the device reset
        should mask all MSI-X table entries, but obviously that's just part
        of the paper specification.
    
    Cure this by:
    
     1) Masking all table entries in hardware
     2) Initializing msi_desc::masked in msix_setup_entries()
     3) Removing the mask dance in msix_program_entries()
     4) Renaming msix_program_entries() to msix_update_entries() to
        reflect the purpose of that function.

    PCI/MSI: Protect msi_desc::masked for multi-MSI
    
    commit 77e89afc25f30abd56e76a809ee2884d7c1b63ce upstream.
    
    Multi-MSI uses a single MSI descriptor and there is a single mask register
    when the device supports per vector masking. To avoid reading back the mask
    register the value is cached in the MSI descriptor and updates are done by
    clearing and setting bits in the cache and writing it to the device.
    
    But nothing protects msi_desc::masked and the mask register from being
    modified concurrently on two different CPUs for two different Linux
    interrupts which belong to the same multi-MSI descriptor.
    
    Add a lock to struct device and protect any operation on the mask and the
    mask register with it.
    
    This makes the update of msi_desc::masked unconditional, but there is no
    place which requires a modification of the hardware register without
    updating the masked cache.
    
    msi_mask_irq() is now an empty wrapper which will be cleaned up in follow
    up changes.
    
    The problem goes way back to the initial support of multi-MSI, but picking
    the commit which introduced the mask cache is a valid cut off point
    (2.6.30).

    PCI/MSI: Do not set invalid bits in MSI mask
    
    commit 361fd37397f77578735907341579397d5bed0a2d upstream.
    
    msi_mask_irq() takes a mask and a flags argument. The mask argument is used
    to mask out bits from the cached mask and the flags argument to set bits.
    
    Some places invoke it with a flags argument which sets bits which are not
    used by the device, i.e. when the device supports up to 8 vectors a full
    unmask in some places sets the mask to 0xFFFFFF00. While devices probably
    do not care, it's still bad practice.

    PCI/MSI: Enable and mask MSI-X early
    
    commit 438553958ba19296663c6d6583d208dfb6792830 upstream.
    
    The ordering of MSI-X enable in hardware is dysfunctional:
    
     1) MSI-X is disabled in the control register
     2) Various setup functions
     3) pci_msi_setup_msi_irqs() is invoked which ends up accessing
        the MSI-X table entries
     4) MSI-X is enabled and masked in the control register with the
        comment that enabling is required for some hardware to access
        the MSI-X table
    
    Step #4 obviously contradicts #3. The history of this is an issue with the
    NIU hardware. When #4 was introduced the table access actually happened in
    msix_program_entries() which was invoked after enabling and masking MSI-X.
    
    This was changed in commit d71d6432e105 ("PCI/MSI: Kill redundant call of
    irq_set_msi_desc() for MSI-X interrupts") which removed the table write
    from msix_program_entries().
    
    Interestingly enough nobody noticed and either NIU still works or it did
    not get any testing with a kernel 3.19 or later.
    
    Nevertheless this is inconsistent and there is no reason why MSI-X can't be
    enabled and masked in the control register early on, i.e. move step #4
    above to step #1. This preserves the NIU workaround and has no side effects
    on other hardware.

    genirq/msi: Ensure deactivation on teardown
    
    commit dbbc93576e03fbe24b365fab0e901eb442237a8a upstream.
    
    msi_domain_alloc_irqs() invokes irq_domain_activate_irq(), but
    msi_domain_free_irqs() does not enforce deactivation before tearing down
    the interrupts.
    
    This happens when PCI/MSI interrupts are set up and never used before being
    torn down again, e.g. in error handling pathes. The only place which cleans
    that up is the error handling path in msi_domain_alloc_irqs().
    
    Move the cleanup from msi_domain_alloc_irqs() into msi_domain_free_irqs()
    to cure that.

    x86/resctrl: Fix default monitoring groups reporting
    
    commit 064855a69003c24bd6b473b367d364e418c57625 upstream.
    
    Creating a new sub monitoring group in the root /sys/fs/resctrl leads to
    getting the "Unavailable" value for mbm_total_bytes and mbm_local_bytes
    on the entire filesystem.
    
    Steps to reproduce:
    
      1. mount -t resctrl resctrl /sys/fs/resctrl/
    
      2. cd /sys/fs/resctrl/
    
      3. cat mon_data/mon_L3_00/mbm_total_bytes
         23189832
    
      4. Create sub monitor group:
      mkdir mon_groups/test1
    
      5. cat mon_data/mon_L3_00/mbm_total_bytes
         Unavailable
    
    When a new monitoring group is created, a new RMID is assigned to the
    new group. But the RMID is not active yet. When the events are read on
    the new RMID, it is expected to report the status as "Unavailable".
    
    When the user reads the events on the default monitoring group with
    multiple subgroups, the events on all subgroups are consolidated
    together. Currently, if any of the RMID reads report as "Unavailable",
    then everything will be reported as "Unavailable".
    
    Fix the issue by discarding the "Unavailable" reads and reporting all
    the successful RMID reads. This is not a problem on Intel systems as
    Intel reports 0 on Inactive RMIDs.

    x86/msi: Force affinity setup before startup
    
    commit ff363f480e5997051dd1de949121ffda3b753741 upstream.
    
    The X86 MSI mechanism cannot handle interrupt affinity changes safely after
    startup other than from an interrupt handler, unless interrupt remapping is
    enabled. The startup sequence in the generic interrupt code violates that
    assumption.

    the default interrupt setting happens before the interrupt is started up
    for the first time.
    
    While the interrupt remapping MSI chip does not require this, there is no
    point in treating it differently as this might spare an interrupt to a CPU
    which is not in the default affinity mask.
    
    For the non-remapping case go to the direct write path when the interrupt
    is not yet started similar to the not yet activated case.

    commit 826da771291fc25a428e871f9e7fb465e390f852 upstream.
    
    X86 IO/APIC and MSI interrupts (when used without interrupts remapping)
    require that the affinity setup on startup is done before the interrupt is
    enabled for the first time as the non-remapped operation mode cannot safely
    migrate enabled interrupts from arbitrary contexts. Provide a new irq chip
    flag which allows affected hardware to request this.
    
    This has to be opt-in because there have been reports in the past that some
    interrupt chips cannot handle affinity setting before startup.

    vsock/virtio: avoid potential deadlock when vsock device remove
    
    [ Upstream commit 49b0b6ffe20c5344f4173f3436298782a08da4f2 ]
    
    There's a potential deadlock case when remove the vsock device or
    process the RESET event:
    
      vsock_for_each_connected_socket:
          spin_lock_bh(&vsock_table_lock) ----------- (1)
          ...
              virtio_vsock_reset_sock:
                  lock_sock(sk) --------------------- (2)
          ...
          spin_unlock_bh(&vsock_table_lock)
    
    lock_sock() may do initiative schedule when the 'sk' is owned by
    other thread at the same time, we would receivce a warning message
    that "scheduling while atomic".
    
    Even worse, if the next task (selected by the scheduler) try to
    release a 'sk', it need to request vsock_table_lock and the deadlock
    occur, cause the system into softlockup state.
      Call trace:
       queued_spin_lock_slowpath
       vsock_remove_bound
       vsock_remove_sock
       virtio_transport_release
       __vsock_release
       vsock_release
       __sock_release
       sock_close
       __fput
       ____fput
    
    So we should not require sk_lock in this case, just like the behavior
    in vhost_vsock or vmci.

    xen/events: Fix race in set_evtchn_to_irq
    
    [ Upstream commit 88ca2521bd5b4e8b83743c01a2d4cb09325b51e9 ]
    
    There is a TOCTOU issue in set_evtchn_to_irq. Rows in the evtchn_to_irq
    mapping are lazily allocated in this function. The check whether the row
    is already present and the row initialization is not synchronized. Two
    threads can at the same time allocate a new row for evtchn_to_irq and
    add the irq mapping to the their newly allocated row. One thread will
    overwrite what the other has set for evtchn_to_irq[row] and therefore
    the irq mapping is lost. This will trigger a BUG_ON later in
    bind_evtchn_to_cpu:

    This patch sets evtchn_to_irq rows via a cmpxchg operation so that they
    will be set only once. The row is now cleared before writing it to
    evtchn_to_irq in order to not create a race once the row is visible for
    other threads.
    
    While at it, do not require the page to be zeroed, because it will be
    overwritten with -1's in clear_evtchn_to_irq_row anyway.

    tcp_bbr: fix u32 wrap bug in round logic if bbr_init() called after 2B packets
    
    [ Upstream commit 6de035fec045f8ae5ee5f3a02373a18b939e91fb ]
    
    Currently if BBR congestion control is initialized after more than 2B
    packets have been delivered, depending on the phase of the
    tp->delivered counter the tracking of BBR round trips can get stuck.
    
    The bug arises because if tp->delivered is between 2^31 and 2^32 at
    the time the BBR congestion control module is initialized, then the
    initialization of bbr->next_rtt_delivered to 0 will cause the logic to
    believe that the end of the round trip is still billions of packets in
    the future. More specifically, the following check will fail
    repeatedly:
    
      !before(rs->prior_delivered, bbr->next_rtt_delivered)
    
    and thus the connection will take up to 2B packets delivered before
    that check will pass and the connection will set:
    
      bbr->round_start = 1;
    
    This could cause many mechanisms in BBR to fail to trigger, for
    example bbr_check_full_bw_reached() would likely never exit STARTUP.
    
    This bug is 5 years old and has not been observed, and as a practical
    matter this would likely rarely trigger, since it would require
    transferring at least 2B packets, or likely more than 3 terabytes of
    data, before switching congestion control algorithms to BBR.
    
    This patch is a stable candidate for kernels as far back as v4.9,
    when tcp_bbr.c was added.

    net: dsa: lan9303: fix broken backpressure in .port_fdb_dump
    
    [ Upstream commit ada2fee185d8145afb89056558bb59545b9dbdd0 ]
    
    rtnl_fdb_dump() has logic to split a dump of PF_BRIDGE neighbors into
    multiple netlink skbs if the buffer provided by user space is too small
    (one buffer will typically handle a few hundred FDB entries).
    
    When the current buffer becomes full, nlmsg_put() in
    dsa_slave_port_fdb_do_dump() returns -EMSGSIZE and DSA saves the index
    of the last dumped FDB entry, returns to rtnl_fdb_dump() up to that
    point, and then the dump resumes on the same port with a new skb, and
    FDB entries up to the saved index are simply skipped.
    
    Since dsa_slave_port_fdb_do_dump() is pointed to by the "cb" passed to
    drivers, then drivers must check for the -EMSGSIZE error code returned
    by it. Otherwise, when a netlink skb becomes full, DSA will no longer
    save newly dumped FDB entries to it, but the driver will continue
    dumping. So FDB entries will be missing from the dump.
    
    Fix the broken backpressure by propagating the "cb" return code and
    allow rtnl_fdb_dump() to restart the FDB dump with a new skb.

    ppp: Fix generating ifname when empty IFLA_IFNAME is specified
    
    [ Upstream commit 2459dcb96bcba94c08d6861f8a050185ff301672 ]
    
    IFLA_IFNAME is nul-term string which means that IFLA_IFNAME buffer can be
    larger than length of string which contains.
    
    Function __rtnl_newlink() generates new own ifname if either IFLA_IFNAME
    was not specified at all or userspace passed empty nul-term string.
    
    It is expected that if userspace does not specify ifname for new ppp netdev
    then kernel generates one in format "ppp<id>" where id matches to the ppp
    unit id which can be later obtained by PPPIOCGUNIT ioctl.
    
    And it works in this way if IFLA_IFNAME is not specified at all. But it
    does not work when IFLA_IFNAME is specified with empty string.
    
    So fix this logic also for empty IFLA_IFNAME in ppp_nl_newlink() function
    and correctly generates ifname based on ppp unit identifier if userspace
    did not provided preferred ifname.
    
    Without this patch when IFLA_IFNAME was specified with empty string then
    kernel created a new ppp interface in format "ppp<id>" but id did not
    match ppp unit id returned by PPPIOCGUNIT ioctl. In this case id was some
    number generated by __rtnl_newlink() function.

    ASoC: cs42l42: Remove duplicate control for WNF filter frequency
    
    [ Upstream commit 8b353bbeae20e2214c9d9d88bcb2fda4ba145d83 ]
    
    The driver was defining two ALSA controls that both change the same
    register field for the wind noise filter corner frequency. The filter
    response has two corners, at different frequencies, and the duplicate
    controls most likely were an attempt to be able to set the value using
    either of the frequencies.
    
    However, having two controls changing the same field can be problematic
    and it is unnecessary. Both frequencies are related to each other so
    setting one implies exactly what the other would be.
    
    Removing a control affects user-side code, but there is currently no
    known use of the removed control so it would be best to remove it now
    before it becomes a problem.

    ACPI: NFIT: Fix support for virtual SPA ranges
    
    commit b93dfa6bda4d4e88e5386490f2b277a26958f9d3 upstream.
    
    Fix the NFIT parsing code to treat a 0 index in a SPA Range Structure as
    a special case and not match Region Mapping Structures that use 0 to
    indicate that they are not mapped. Without this fix some platform BIOS
    descriptions of "virtual disk" ranges do not result in the pmem driver
    attaching to the range.
    
    Details:
    In addition to typical persistent memory ranges, the ACPI NFIT may also
    convey "virtual" ranges. These ranges are indicated by a UUID in the SPA
    Range Structure of UUID_VOLATILE_VIRTUAL_DISK, UUID_VOLATILE_VIRTUAL_CD,
    UUID_PERSISTENT_VIRTUAL_DISK, or UUID_PERSISTENT_VIRTUAL_CD. The
    critical difference between virtual ranges and UUID_PERSISTENT_MEMORY,
    is that virtual do not support associations with Region Mapping
    Structures.  For this reason the "index" value of virtual SPA Range
    Structures is allowed to be 0. If a platform BIOS decides to represent
    NVDIMMs with disconnected "Region Mapping Structures" (range-index ==
    0), the kernel may falsely associate them with standalone ranges where
    the "SPA Range Structure Index" is also zero. When this happens the
    driver may falsely require labels where "virtual disks" are expected to
    be label-less. I.e. "label-less" is where the namespace-range ==
    region-range and the pmem driver attaches with no user action to create
    a namespace.

    i2c: dev: zero out array used for i2c reads from userspace
    
    commit 86ff25ed6cd8240d18df58930bd8848b19fce308 upstream.
    
    If an i2c driver happens to not provide the full amount of data that a
    user asks for, it is possible that some uninitialized data could be sent
    to userspace.  While all in-kernel drivers look to be safe, just be sure
    by initializing the buffer to zero before it is passed to the i2c driver
    so that any future drivers will not have this issue.
    
    Also properly copy the amount of data recvieved to the userspace buffer,
    as pointed out by Dan Carpenter.

    ASoC: intel: atom: Fix reference to PCM buffer address
    
    commit 2e6b836312a477d647a7920b56810a5a25f6c856 upstream.
    
    PCM buffers might be allocated dynamically when the buffer
    preallocation failed or a larger buffer is requested, and it's not
    guaranteed that substream->dma_buffer points to the actually used
    buffer.  The address should be retrieved from runtime->dma_addr,
    instead of substream->dma_buffer (and shouldn't use virt_to_phys).
    
    Also, remove the line overriding runtime->dma_area superfluously,
    which was already set up at the PCM buffer allocation.

    iio: adc: Fix incorrect exit of for-loop
    
    commit 5afc1540f13804a31bb704b763308e17688369c5 upstream.
    
    Currently the for-loop that scans for the optimial adc_period iterates
    through all the possible adc_period levels because the exit logic in
    the loop is inverted. I believe the comparison should be swapped and
    the continue replaced with a break to exit the loop at the correct
    point.

    iio: humidity: hdc100x: Add margin to the conversion time
    
    commit 84edec86f449adea9ee0b4912a79ab8d9d65abb7 upstream.
    
    The datasheets have the following note for the conversion time
    specification: "This parameter is specified by design and/or
    characterization and it is not tested in production."
    
    Parts have been seen that require more time to do 14-bit conversions for
    the relative humidity channel.  The result is ENXIO due to the address
    phase of a transfer not getting an ACK.
    
    Delay an additional 1 ms per conversion to allow for additional margin.
