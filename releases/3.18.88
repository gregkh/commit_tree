    arm: KVM: Fix VTTBR_BADDR_MASK BUG_ON off-by-one
    
    commit 5553b142be11e794ebc0805950b2e8313f93d718 upstream.
    
    VTTBR_BADDR_MASK is used to sanity check the size and alignment of the
    VTTBR address. It seems to currently be off by one, thereby only
    allowing up to 39-bit addresses (instead of 40-bit) and also
    insufficiently checking the alignment. This patch fixes it.
    
    This patch is the 32bit pendent of Kristina's arm64 fix, and
    she deserves the actual kudos for pinpointing that one.

    audit: ensure that 'audit=1' actually enables audit for PID 1
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 173743dd99a49c956b124a74c8aacb0384739a4c ]
    
    Prior to this patch we enabled audit in audit_init(), which is too
    late for PID 1 as the standard initcalls are run after the PID 1 task
    is forked.  This means that we never allocate an audit_context (see
    audit_alloc()) for PID 1 and therefore miss a lot of audit events
    generated by PID 1.
    
    This patch enables audit as early as possible to help ensure that when
    PID 1 is forked it can allocate an audit_context if required.

    The UMR's QP is created by calling mlx5_ib_create_qp directly, and

    Assign them right after calling the mlx5_ib_create_qp to assure

    IB/mlx4: Increase maximal message size under UD QP
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5f22a1d87c5315a98981ecf93cd8de226cffe6ca ]
    
    Maximal message should be used as a limit to the max message payload allowed,
    without the headers. The ConnectX-3 check is done against this value includes
    the headers. When the payload is 4K this will cause the NIC to drop packets.
    
    Increase maximal message to 8K as workaround, this shouldn't change current
    behaviour because we continue to set the MTU to 4k.
    
    To reproduce;
    set MTU to 4296 on the corresponding interface, for example:
    ifconfig eth0 mtu 4296 (both server and client)
    
    On server:
    ib_send_bw -c UD -d mlx4_0 -s 4096 -n 1000000 -i1 -m 4096
    
    On client:
    ib_send_bw -d mlx4_0 -c UD <server_ip> -s 4096 -n 1000000 -i 1 -m 4096

    xfrm: Copy policy family in clone_policy
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 0e74aa1d79a5bbc663e03a2804399cae418a0321 ]
    
    The syzbot found an ancient bug in the IPsec code.  When we cloned
    a socket policy (for example, for a child TCP socket derived from a
    listening socket), we did not copy the family field.  This results
    in a live policy with a zero family field.  This triggers a BUG_ON
    check in the af_key code when the cloned policy is retrieved.
    
    This patch fixes it by copying the family field over.

    sctp: use the right sk after waking up from wait_buf sleep
    
    
    [ Upstream commit cea0cc80a6777beb6eb643d4ad53690e1ad1d4ff ]
    
    Commit dfcb9f4f99f1 ("sctp: deny peeloff operation on asocs with threads
    sleeping on it") fixed the race between peeloff and wait sndbuf by
    checking waitqueue_active(&asoc->wait) in sctp_do_peeloff().
    
    But it actually doesn't work, as even if waitqueue_active returns false
    the waiting sndbuf thread may still not yet hold sk lock. After asoc is
    peeled off, sk is not asoc->base.sk any more, then to hold the old sk
    lock couldn't make assoc safe to access.
    
    This patch is to fix this by changing to hold the new sk lock if sk is
    not asoc->base.sk, meanwhile, also set the sk in sctp_sendmsg with the
    new sk.
    
    With this fix, there is no more race between peeloff and waitbuf, the
    check 'waitqueue_active' in sctp_do_peeloff can be removed.
    
    Thanks Marcelo and Neil for making this clear.
    
    v1->v2:
      fix it by changing to lock the new sock instead of adding a flag in asoc.

    sctp: do not free asoc when it is already dead in sctp_sendmsg
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ca3af4dd28cff4e7216e213ba3b671fbf9f84758 ]
    
    Now in sctp_sendmsg sctp_wait_for_sndbuf could schedule out without
    holding sock sk. It means the current asoc can be freed elsewhere,
    like when receiving an abort packet.
    
    If the asoc is just created in sctp_sendmsg and sctp_wait_for_sndbuf
    returns err, the asoc will be freed again due to new_asoc is not nil.
    An use-after-free issue would be triggered by this.
    
    This patch is to fix it by setting new_asoc with nil if the asoc is
    already dead when cpu schedules back, so that it will not be freed
    again in sctp_sendmsg.
    
    v1->v2:
      set new_asoc as nil in sctp_sendmsg instead of sctp_wait_for_sndbuf.

    sparc64/mm: set fields in deferred pages
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 2a20aa171071a334d80c4e5d5af719d8374702fc ]
    
    Without deferred struct page feature (CONFIG_DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT),
    flags and other fields in "struct page"es are never changed prior to
    first initializing struct pages by going through __init_single_page().
    
    With deferred struct page feature enabled there is a case where we set
    some fields prior to initializing:
    
    mem_init() {
         register_page_bootmem_info();
         free_all_bootmem();
         ...
    }
    
    When register_page_bootmem_info() is called only non-deferred struct
    pages are initialized.  But, this function goes through some reserved
    pages which might be part of the deferred, and thus are not yet
    initialized.
    
    mem_init
    register_page_bootmem_info
    register_page_bootmem_info_node
     get_page_bootmem
      .. setting fields here ..
      such as: page->freelist = (void *)type;
    
    free_all_bootmem()
    free_low_memory_core_early()
     for_each_reserved_mem_region()
      reserve_bootmem_region()
       init_reserved_page() <- Only if this is deferred reserved page
        __init_single_pfn()
         __init_single_page()
          memset(0) <-- Loose the set fields here
    
    We end up with similar issue as in the previous patch, where currently
    we do not observe problem as memory is zeroed.  But, if flag asserts are
    changed we can start hitting issues.
    
    Also, because in this patch series we will stop zeroing struct page
    memory during allocation, we must make sure that struct pages are
    properly initialized prior to using them.
    
    The deferred-reserved pages are initialized in free_all_bootmem().
    Therefore, the fix is to switch the above calls.

    [ Upstream commit 1f3c790bd5989fcfec9e53ad8fa09f5b740c958f ]
    
    line-range is supposed to treat "1-" as "1-endoffile", so
    handle the special case by setting last_lineno to UINT_MAX.
    
    Fixes this error:
    
      dynamic_debug:ddebug_parse_query: last-line:0 < 1st-line:1
      dynamic_debug:ddebug_exec_query: query parse failed

    lib/genalloc.c: make the avail variable an atomic_long_t
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 36a3d1dd4e16bcd0d2ddfb4a2ec7092f0ae0d931 ]
    
    If the amount of resources allocated to a gen_pool exceeds 2^32 then the
    avail atomic overflows and this causes problems when clients try and
    borrow resources from the pool.  This is only expected to be an issue on
    64 bit systems.
    
    Add the <linux/atomic.h> header to pull in atomic_long* operations.  So
    that 32 bit systems continue to use atomic32_t but 64 bit systems can
    use atomic64_t.

    route: update fnhe_expires for redirect when the fnhe exists
    
    
    [ Upstream commit e39d5246111399dbc6e11cd39fd8580191b86c47 ]
    
    Now when creating fnhe for redirect, it sets fnhe_expires for this
    new route cache. But when updating the exist one, it doesn't do it.
    It will cause this fnhe never to be expired.
    
    Paolo already noticed it before, in Jianlin's test case, it became
    even worse:
    
    When ip route flush cache, the old fnhe is not to be removed, but
    only clean it's members. When redirect comes again, this fnhe will
    be found and updated, but never be expired due to fnhe_expires not
    being set.
    
    So fix it by simply updating fnhe_expires even it's for redirect.

    route: also update fnhe_genid when updating a route cache
    
    
    [ Upstream commit cebe84c6190d741045a322f5343f717139993c08 ]
    
    Now when ip route flush cache and it turn out all fnhe_genid != genid.
    If a redirect/pmtu icmp packet comes and the old fnhe is found and all
    it's members but fnhe_genid will be updated.
    
    Then next time when it looks up route and tries to rebind this fnhe to
    the new dst, the fnhe will be flushed due to fnhe_genid != genid. It
    causes this redirect/pmtu icmp packet acutally not to be applied.
    
    This patch is to also reset fnhe_genid when updating a route cache.

    EDAC, i5000, i5400: Fix definition of NRECMEMB register
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a8c8261425649da58bdf08221570e5335ad33a31 ]
    
    In the i5000 and i5400 drivers, the NRECMEMB register is defined as a
    16-bit value, which results in wrong shifts in the code, as reported by
    sparse.
    
    In the datasheets ([1], section 3.9.22.20 and [2], section 3.9.22.21),
    this register is a 32-bit register. A u32 value for the register fixes
    the wrong shifts warnings and matches the datasheet.
    
    Also fix the mask to access to the CAS bits [27:16] in the i5000 driver.

    crypto: s5p-sss - Fix completing crypto request in IRQ handler
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 07de4bc88ce6a4d898cad9aa4c99c1df7e87702d ]
    
    In a regular interrupt handler driver was finishing the crypt/decrypt
    request by calling complete on crypto request.  This is disallowed since
    converting to skcipher in commit b286d8b1a690 ("crypto: skcipher - Add
    skcipher walk interface") and causes a warning:
            WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at crypto/skcipher.c:430 skcipher_walk_first+0x13c/0x14c
    
    The interrupt is marked shared but in fact there are no other users
    sharing it.  Thus the simplest solution seems to be to just use a
    threaded interrupt handler, after converting it to oneshot.

    arm: KVM: Survive unknown traps from guests
    
    
    [ Upstream commit f050fe7a9164945dd1c28be05bf00e8cfb082ccf ]
    
    Currently we BUG() if we see a HSR.EC value we don't recognise. As
    configurable disables/enables are added to the architecture (controlled
    by RES1/RES0 bits respectively), with associated synchronous exceptions,
    it may be possible for a guest to trigger exceptions with classes that
    we don't recognise.
    
    While we can't service these exceptions in a manner useful to the guest,
    we can avoid bringing down the host. Per ARM DDI 0406C.c, all currently
    unallocated HSR EC encodings are reserved, and per ARM DDI
    0487A.k_iss10775, page G6-4395, EC values within the range 0x00 - 0x2c
    are reserved for future use with synchronous exceptions, and EC values
    within the range 0x2d - 0x3f may be used for either synchronous or
    asynchronous exceptions.
    
    The patch makes KVM handle any unknown EC by injecting an UNDEFINED
    exception into the guest, with a corresponding (ratelimited) warning in
    the host dmesg. We could later improve on this with with a new (opt-in)
    exit to the host userspace.

    The syzkaller folks reported a nested_run_pending warning during userspace
    clear VMX capability which is exposed to L1 before.
    
    The warning gets thrown while doing
    
    (*(uint32_t*)0x20aecfe8 = (uint32_t)0x1);
    (*(uint32_t*)0x20aecfec = (uint32_t)0x0);
    (*(uint32_t*)0x20aecff0 = (uint32_t)0x3a);
    (*(uint32_t*)0x20aecff4 = (uint32_t)0x0);
    (*(uint64_t*)0x20aecff8 = (uint64_t)0x0);
    r[29] = syscall(__NR_ioctl, r[4], 0x4008ae89ul,
                    0x20aecfe8ul, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    
    i.e. KVM_SET_MSR ioctl with
    
    struct kvm_msrs {
            .nmsrs = 1,
                    .pad = 0,
                    .entries = {
                            {.index = MSR_IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL,
                             .reserved = 0,
                             .data = 0}
                    }
    }
    
    The VMLANCH/VMRESUME emulation should be stopped since the CPU is going to
    reset here. This patch resets the nested_run_pending since the CPU is going
    to be reset hence there should be nothing pending.

    irqchip/crossbar: Fix incorrect type of register size
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 4b9de5da7e120c7f02395da729f0ec77ce7a6044 ]
    
    The 'size' variable is unsigned according to the dt-bindings.
    As this variable is used as integer in other places, create a new variable
    that allows to fix the following sparse issue (-Wtypesign):
    
      drivers/irqchip/irq-crossbar.c:279:52: warning: incorrect type in argument 3 (different signedness)

    workqueue: trigger WARN if queue_delayed_work() is called with NULL @wq
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 637fdbae60d6cb9f6e963c1079d7e0445c86ff7d ]
    
    If queue_delayed_work() gets called with NULL @wq, the kernel will
    oops asynchronuosly on timer expiration which isn't too helpful in
    tracking down the offender.  This actually happened with smc.
    
    __queue_delayed_work() already does several input sanity checks
    synchronously.  Add NULL @wq check.

    libata: drop WARN from protocol error in ata_sff_qc_issue()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 0580b762a4d6b70817476b90042813f8573283fa ]
    
    ata_sff_qc_issue() expects upper layers to never issue commands on a
    command protocol that it doesn't implement.  While the assumption
    holds fine with the usual IO path, nothing filters based on the
    command protocol in the passthrough path (which was added later),
    allowing the warning to be tripped with a passthrough command with the
    right (well, wrong) protocol.
    
    Failing with AC_ERR_SYSTEM is the right thing to do anyway.  Remove
    the unnecessary WARN.

    [ Upstream commit a6d8a21596df041f36f4c2ccc260c459e3e851f1 ]
    
    Tests under alignment subdirectory are skipped when executed on previous
    generation hardware, but harness still marks them as failed.
    
      test: test_copy_unaligned
      tags: git_version:unknown
      [SKIP] Test skipped on line 26
      skip: test_copy_unaligned

    The MAGIC_SKIP_RETURN_VALUE value assigned to rc variable is retained till
    the program exit which causes the test to be marked as failed.
    
    This patch resets the value before returning to the main() routine.
    With this patch the test o/p is as follows:
    
      test: test_copy_unaligned

    net/packet: fix a race in packet_bind() and packet_notifier()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 15fe076edea787807a7cdc168df832544b58eba6 ]
    
    syzbot reported crashes [1] and provided a C repro easing bug hunting.
    
    When/if packet_do_bind() calls __unregister_prot_hook() and releases
    po->bind_lock, another thread can run packet_notifier() and process an
    NETDEV_UP event.
    
    This calls register_prot_hook() and hooks again the socket right before
    first thread is able to grab again po->bind_lock.
    
    Fixes this issue by temporarily setting po->num to 0, as suggested by
    David Miller.

    rds: Fix NULL pointer dereference in __rds_rdma_map
    
    
    [ Upstream commit f3069c6d33f6ae63a1668737bc78aaaa51bff7ca ]
    
    This is a fix for syzkaller719569, where memory registration was
    attempted without any underlying transport being loaded.
    
    Analysis of the case reveals that it is the setsockopt() RDS_GET_MR
    (2) and RDS_GET_MR_FOR_DEST (7) that are vulnerable.
    
    Here is an example stack trace when the bug is hit:

    arm64: fpsimd: Prevent registers leaking from dead tasks
    
    commit 071b6d4a5d343046f253a5a8835d477d93992002 upstream.
    
    Currently, loading of a task's fpsimd state into the CPU registers
    is skipped if that task's state is already present in the registers
    of that CPU.
    
    However, the code relies on the struct fpsimd_state * (and by
    extension struct task_struct *) to unambiguously identify a task.
    
    There is a particular case in which this doesn't work reliably:
    when a task exits, its task_struct may be recycled to describe a
    new task.
    
    Consider the following scenario:
    
     1) Task P loads its fpsimd state onto cpu C.
            per_cpu(fpsimd_last_state, C) := P;
            P->thread.fpsimd_state.cpu := C;
    
     2) Task X is scheduled onto C and loads its fpsimd state on C.
            per_cpu(fpsimd_last_state, C) := X;
            X->thread.fpsimd_state.cpu := C;
    
     3) X exits, causing X's task_struct to be freed.
    
     4) P forks a new child T, which obtains X's recycled task_struct.
            T == X.
            T->thread.fpsimd_state.cpu == C (inherited from P).
    
     5) T is scheduled on C.
            T's fpsimd state is not loaded, because
            per_cpu(fpsimd_last_state, C) == T (== X) &&
            T->thread.fpsimd_state.cpu == C.
    
            (This is the check performed by fpsimd_thread_switch().)
    
    So, T gets X's registers because the last registers loaded onto C
    were those of X, in (2).
    
    This patch fixes the problem by ensuring that the sched-in check
    fails in (5): fpsimd_flush_task_state(T) is called when T is
    forked, so that T->thread.fpsimd_state.cpu == C cannot be true.
    This relies on the fact that T is not schedulable until after
    copy_thread() completes.
    
    Once T's fpsimd state has been loaded on some CPU C there may still
    be other cpus D for which per_cpu(fpsimd_last_state, D) ==
    &X->thread.fpsimd_state.  But D is necessarily != C in this case,
    and the check in (5) must fail.
    
    An alternative fix would be to do refcounting on task_struct.  This
    would result in each CPU holding a reference to the last task whose
    fpsimd state was loaded there.  It's not clear whether this is
    preferable, and it involves higher overhead than the fix proposed
    in this patch.  It would also move all the task_struct freeing
    work into the context switch critical section, or otherwise some
    deferred cleanup mechanism would need to be introduced, neither of
    which seems obviously justified.

    KVM: VMX: remove I/O port 0x80 bypass on Intel hosts
    
    commit d59d51f088014f25c2562de59b9abff4f42a7468 upstream.
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-1000407.
    
    KVM allows guests to directly access I/O port 0x80 on Intel hosts.  If
    the guest floods this port with writes it generates exceptions and
    instability in the host kernel, leading to a crash.  With this change
    guest writes to port 0x80 on Intel will behave the same as they
    currently behave on AMD systems.
    
    Prevent the flooding by removing the code that sets port 0x80 as a
    passthrough port.  This is essentially the same as upstream patch
    99f85a28a78e96d28907fe036e1671a218fee597, except that patch was
    for AMD chipsets and this patch is for Intel.

    arm64: KVM: fix VTTBR_BADDR_MASK BUG_ON off-by-one
    
    commit 26aa7b3b1c0fb3f1a6176a0c1847204ef4355693 upstream.
    
    VTTBR_BADDR_MASK is used to sanity check the size and alignment of the
    VTTBR address. It seems to currently be off by one, thereby only
    allowing up to 47-bit addresses (instead of 48-bit) and also
    insufficiently checking the alignment. This patch fixes it.
    
    As an example, with 4k pages, before this patch we have:
    
      PHYS_MASK_SHIFT = 48
      VTTBR_X = 37 - 24 = 13
      VTTBR_BADDR_SHIFT = 13 - 1 = 12
      VTTBR_BADDR_MASK = ((1 << 35) - 1) << 12 = 0x00007ffffffff000
    
    Which is wrong, because the mask doesn't allow bit 47 of the VTTBR
    address to be set, and only requires the address to be 12-bit (4k)
    aligned, while it actually needs to be 13-bit (8k) aligned because we
    concatenate two 4k tables.
    
    With this patch, the mask becomes 0x0000ffffffffe000, which is what we
    want.

    iommu/vt-d: Fix scatterlist offset handling
    
    commit 29a90b70893817e2f2bb3cea40a29f5308e21b21 upstream.
    
    The intel-iommu DMA ops fail to correctly handle scatterlists where
    sg->offset is greater than PAGE_SIZE - the IOVA allocation is computed
    appropriately based on the page-aligned portion of the offset, but the
    mapping is set up relative to sg->page, which means it fails to actually
    cover the whole buffer (and in the worst case doesn't cover it at all):
    
        (sg->dma_address + sg->dma_len) ----+
        sg->dma_address ---------+          |
        iov_pfn------+           |          |
                     |           |          |
                     v           v          v
    iova:   a        b        c        d        e        f
            |--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
                              <...calculated....>
                     [_____mapped______]
    pfn:    0        1        2        3        4        5

                     ^           ^          ^
                     |           |          |
        sg->page ----+           |          |
        sg->offset --------------+          |
        (sg->offset + sg->length) ----------+
    
    As a result, the caller ends up overrunning the mapping into whatever
    lies beyond, which usually goes badly:
    
    [  429.645492] DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 2
    [  429.650847] DMAR: [DMA Write] Request device [02:00.4] fault addr f2682000 ...
    
    Whilst this is a fairly rare occurrence, it can happen from the result
    of intermediate scatterlist processing such as scatterwalk_ffwd() in the
    crypto layer. Whilst that particular site could be fixed up, it still
    seems worthwhile to bring intel-iommu in line with other DMA API
    implementations in handling this robustly.
    
    To that end, fix the intel_map_sg() path to line up the mapping
    correctly (in units of MM pages rather than VT-d pages to match the
    aligned_nrpages() calculation) regardless of the offset, and use
    sg_phys() consistently for clarity.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out-of-bound error
    
    commit 251552a2b0d454badc8f486e6d79100970c744b0 upstream.
    
    The snd_usb_copy_string_desc() retrieves the usb string corresponding to
    the index number through the usb_string(). The problem is that the
    usb_string() returns the length of the string (>= 0) when successful, but
    it can also return a negative value about the error case or status of
    usb_control_msg().
    
    If iClockSource is '0' as shown below, usb_string() will returns -EINVAL.
    This will result in '0' being inserted into buf[-22], and the following
    KASAN out-of-bound error message will be output.

    x86/PCI: Make broadcom_postcore_init() check acpi_disabled
    
    commit ddec3bdee05b06f1dda20ded003c3e10e4184cab upstream.
    
    acpi_os_get_root_pointer() may return a valid address even if acpi_disabled
    is set, but the host bridge information from the ACPI tables is not going
    to be used in that case and the Broadcom host bridge initialization should
    not be skipped then, So make broadcom_postcore_init() check acpi_disabled
    too to avoid this issue.

    X.509: reject invalid BIT STRING for subjectPublicKey
    
    commit 0f30cbea005bd3077bd98cd29277d7fc2699c1da upstream.
    
    Adding a specially crafted X.509 certificate whose subjectPublicKey
    ASN.1 value is zero-length caused x509_extract_key_data() to set the
    public key size to SIZE_MAX, as it subtracted the nonexistent BIT STRING
    metadata byte.  Then, x509_cert_parse() called kmemdup() with that bogus
    size, triggering the WARN_ON_ONCE() in kmalloc_slab().
    
    This appears to be harmless, but it still must be fixed since WARNs are
    never supposed to be user-triggerable.
    
    Fix it by updating x509_cert_parse() to validate that the value has a
    BIT STRING metadata byte, and that the byte is 0 which indicates that
    the number of bits in the bitstring is a multiple of 8.
    
    It would be nice to handle the metadata byte in asn1_ber_decoder()
    instead.  But that would be tricky because in the general case a BIT
    STRING could be implicitly tagged, and/or could legitimately have a
    length that is not a whole number of bytes.
    
    Here was the WARN (cleaned up slightly):

    KEYS: add missing permission check for request_key() destination
    
    commit 4dca6ea1d9432052afb06baf2e3ae78188a4410b upstream.
    
    When the request_key() syscall is not passed a destination keyring, it
    links the requested key (if constructed) into the "default" request-key
    keyring.  This should require Write permission to the keyring.  However,
    there is actually no permission check.
    
    This can be abused to add keys to any keyring to which only Search
    permission is granted.  This is because Search permission allows joining
    the keyring.  keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring(KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_SESSION_KEYRING)
    then will set the default request-key keyring to the session keyring.
    Then, request_key() can be used to add keys to the keyring.
    
    Both negatively and positively instantiated keys can be added using this
    method.  Adding negative keys is trivial.  Adding a positive key is a
    bit trickier.  It requires that either /sbin/request-key positively
    instantiates the key, or that another thread adds the key to the process
    keyring at just the right time, such that request_key() misses it
    initially but then finds it in construct_alloc_key().
    
    Fix this bug by checking for Write permission to the keyring in
    construct_get_dest_keyring() when the default keyring is being used.
    
    We don't do the permission check for non-default keyrings because that
    was already done by the earlier call to lookup_user_key().  Also,
    request_key_and_link() is currently passed a 'struct key *' rather than
    a key_ref_t, so the "possessed" bit is unavailable.
    
    We also don't do the permission check for the "requestor keyring", to
    continue to support the use case described by commit 8bbf4976b59f
    ("KEYS: Alter use of key instantiation link-to-keyring argument") where
    /sbin/request-key recursively calls request_key() to add keys to the
    original requestor's destination keyring.  (I don't know of any users
    who actually do that, though...)

    ASN.1: check for error from ASN1_OP_END__ACT actions
    
    commit 81a7be2cd69b412ab6aeacfe5ebf1bb6e5bce955 upstream.
    
    asn1_ber_decoder() was ignoring errors from actions associated with the
    opcodes ASN1_OP_END_SEQ_ACT, ASN1_OP_END_SET_ACT,
    ASN1_OP_END_SEQ_OF_ACT, and ASN1_OP_END_SET_OF_ACT.  In practice, this
    meant the pkcs7_note_signed_info() action (since that was the only user
    of those opcodes).  Fix it by checking for the error, just like the
    decoder does for actions associated with the other opcodes.
    
    This bug allowed users to leak slab memory by repeatedly trying to add a
    specially crafted "pkcs7_test" key (requires CONFIG_PKCS7_TEST_KEY).
    
    In theory, this bug could also be used to bypass module signature
    verification, by providing a PKCS#7 message that is misparsed such that
    a signature's ->authattrs do not contain its ->msgdigest.  But it
    doesn't seem practical in normal cases, due to restrictions on the
    format of the ->authattrs.

    Thanks to the scripts/leaking_addresses.pl script, it was found that
    some EFI values should not be readable by non-root users.
    
    So make them root-only, and to do that, add a __ATTR_RO_MODE() macro to
    make this easier, and use it in other places at the same time.

    isa: Prevent NULL dereference in isa_bus driver callbacks
    
    commit 5a244727f428a06634f22bb890e78024ab0c89f3 upstream.
    
    The isa_driver structure for an isa_bus device is stored in the device
    platform_data member of the respective device structure. This
    platform_data member may be reset to NULL if isa_driver match callback
    for the device fails, indicating a device unsupported by the ISA driver.
    
    This patch fixes a possible NULL pointer dereference if one of the
    isa_driver callbacks to attempted for an unsupported device. This error
    should not occur in practice since ISA devices are typically manually
    configured and loaded by the users, but we may as well prevent this
    error from popping up for the 0day testers.

    hv: kvp: Avoid reading past allocated blocks from KVP file
    
    commit 297d6b6e56c2977fc504c61bbeeaa21296923f89 upstream.
    
    While reading in more than one block (50) of KVP records, the allocation
    goes per block, but the reads used the total number of allocated records
    (without resetting the pointer/stream). This causes the records buffer to
    overrun when the refresh reads more than one block over the previous
    capacity (e.g. reading more than 100 KVP records whereas the in-memory
    database was empty before).
    
    Fix this by reading the correct number of KVP records from file each time.
