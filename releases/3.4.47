    media: mantis: fix silly crash case
    
    commit e1d45ae10aea8e8a403e5d96bf5902ee670007ff upstream.
    
    If we set mantis->fe to NULL on an error its not a good idea to then try
    passing NULL to the unregister paths and oopsing really.

    i2c: designware: always clear interrupts before enabling them
    
    commit 2a2d95e9d6d29e726cc294b65391917ed2e32bf4 upstream.
    
    If the I2C bus is put to a low power state by an ACPI method it might pull
    the SDA line low (as its power is removed). Once the bus is put to full
    power state again, the SDA line is pulled back to high. This transition
    looks like a STOP condition from the controller point-of-view which sets
    STOP detected bit in its status register causing the driver to fail
    subsequent transfers.
    
    Fix this by always clearing all interrupts before we start a transfer.

    btrfs: don't stop searching after encountering the wrong item
    
    commit 03b71c6ca6286625d8f1ed44aabab9b5bf5dac10 upstream.
    
    The search ioctl skips items that are too large for a result buffer, but
    inline items of a certain size occuring before any search result is
    found would trigger an overflow and stop the search entirely.
