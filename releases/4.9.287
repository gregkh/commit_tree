    perf/x86: Reset destroy callback on event init failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 02d029a41dc986e2d5a77ecca45803857b346829 ]
    
    perf_init_event tries multiple init callbacks and does not reset the
    event state between tries. When x86_pmu_event_init runs, it
    unconditionally sets the destroy callback to hw_perf_event_destroy. On
    the next init attempt after x86_pmu_event_init, in perf_try_init_event,
    if the pmu's capabilities includes PERF_PMU_CAP_NO_EXCLUDE, the destroy
    callback will be run. However, if the next init didn't set the destroy
    callback, hw_perf_event_destroy will be run (since the callback wasn't
    reset).
    
    Looking at other pmu init functions, the common pattern is to only set
    the destroy callback on a successful init. Resetting the callback on
    failure tries to replicate that pattern.
    
    This was discovered after commit f11dd0d80555 ("perf/x86/amd/ibs: Extend
    PERF_PMU_CAP_NO_EXCLUDE to IBS Op") when the second (and only second)
    run of the perf tool after a reboot results in 0 samples being
    generated. The extra run of hw_perf_event_destroy results in
    active_events having an extra decrement on each perf run. The second run
    has active_events == 0 and every subsequent run has active_events < 0.
    When active_events == 0, the NMI handler will early-out and not record
    any samples.

    gup: document and work around "COW can break either way" issue
    
    commit 17839856fd588f4ab6b789f482ed3ffd7c403e1f upstream.
    
    Doing a "get_user_pages()" on a copy-on-write page for reading can be
    ambiguous: the page can be COW'ed at any time afterwards, and the
    direction of a COW event isn't defined.
    
    Yes, whoever writes to it will generally do the COW, but if the thread
    that did the get_user_pages() unmapped the page before the write (and
    that could happen due to memory pressure in addition to any outright
    action), the writer could also just take over the old page instead.
    
    End result: the get_user_pages() call might result in a page pointer
    that is no longer associated with the original VM, and is associated
    with - and controlled by - another VM having taken it over instead.
    
    So when doing a get_user_pages() on a COW mapping, the only really safe
    thing to do would be to break the COW when getting the page, even when
    only getting it for reading.
    
    At the same time, some users simply don't even care.
    
    For example, the perf code wants to look up the page not because it
    cares about the page, but because the code simply wants to look up the
    physical address of the access for informational purposes, and doesn't
    really care about races when a page might be unmapped and remapped
    elsewhere.
    
    This adds logic to force a COW event by setting FOLL_WRITE on any
    copy-on-write mapping when FOLL_GET (or FOLL_PIN) is used to get a page
    pointer as a result.
    
    The current semantics end up being:
    
     - __get_user_pages_fast(): no change. If you don't ask for a write,
       you won't break COW. You'd better know what you're doing.
    
     - get_user_pages_fast(): the fast-case "look it up in the page tables
       without anything getting mmap_sem" now refuses to follow a read-only
       page, since it might need COW breaking.  Which happens in the slow
       path - the fast path doesn't know if the memory might be COW or not.
    
     - get_user_pages() (including the slow-path fallback for gup_fast()):
       for a COW mapping, turn on FOLL_WRITE for FOLL_GET/FOLL_PIN, with
       very similar semantics to FOLL_FORCE.
    
    If it turns out that we want finer granularity (ie "only break COW when
    it might actually matter" - things like the zero page are special and
    don't need to be broken) we might need to push these semantics deeper
    into the lookup fault path.  So if people care enough, it's possible
    that we might end up adding a new internal FOLL_BREAK_COW flag to go
    with the internal FOLL_COW flag we already have for tracking "I had a
    COW".
    
    Alternatively, if it turns out that different callers might want to
    explicitly control the forced COW break behavior, we might even want to
    make such a flag visible to the users of get_user_pages() instead of
    using the above default semantics.
    
    But for now, this is mostly commentary on the issue (this commit message
    being a lot bigger than the patch, and that patch in turn is almost all
    comments), with that minimal "enable COW breaking early" logic using the
    existing FOLL_WRITE behavior.
    
    [ It might be worth noting that we've always had this ambiguity, and it
      could arguably be seen as a user-space issue.
    
      You only get private COW mappings that could break either way in
      situations where user space is doing cooperative things (ie fork()
      before an execve() etc), but it _is_ surprising and very subtle, and
      fork() is supposed to give you independent address spaces.
    
      So let's treat this as a kernel issue and make the semantics of
      get_user_pages() easier to understand. Note that obviously a true
      shared mapping will still get a page that can change under us, so this
      does _not_ mean that get_user_pages() somehow returns any "stable"
      page ]
    
    [surenb: backport notes
            Since gup_pgd_range does not exist, made appropriate changes on
            the the gup_huge_pgd, gup_huge_pd and gup_pud_range calls instead.
            Replaced (gup_flags | FOLL_WRITE) with write=1 in gup_huge_pgd,
            gup_huge_pd and gup_pud_range.
            Removed FOLL_PIN usage in should_force_cow_break since it's missing in
            the earlier kernels.]

    i40e: fix endless loop under rtnl
    
    [ Upstream commit 857b6c6f665cca9828396d9743faf37fd09e9ac3 ]
    
    The loop in i40e_get_capabilities can never end. The problem is that
    although i40e_aq_discover_capabilities returns with an error if there's
    a firmware problem, the returned error is not checked. There is a check for
    pf->hw.aq.asq_last_status but that value is set to I40E_AQ_RC_OK on most
    firmware problems.
    
    When i40e_aq_discover_capabilities encounters a firmware problem, it will
    encounter the same problem on its next invocation. As the result, the loop
    becomes endless. We hit this with I40E_ERR_ADMIN_QUEUE_TIMEOUT but looking
    at the code, it can happen with a range of other firmware errors.
    
    I don't know what the correct behavior should be: whether the firmware
    should be retried a few times, or whether pf->hw.aq.asq_last_status should
    be always set to the encountered firmware error (but then it would be
    pointless and can be just replaced by the i40e_aq_discover_capabilities
    return value). However, the current behavior with an endless loop under the
    rtnl mutex(!) is unacceptable and Intel has not submitted a fix, although we
    explained the bug to them 7 months ago.
    
    This may not be the best possible fix but it's better than hanging the whole
    system on a firmware bug.

    phy: mdio: fix memory leak
    
    [ Upstream commit ca6e11c337daf7925ff8a2aac8e84490a8691905 ]
    
    Syzbot reported memory leak in MDIO bus interface, the problem was in
    wrong state logic.
    
    MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED indicates 2 states:
            1. Bus is only allocated
            2. Bus allocated and __mdiobus_register() fails, but
               device_register() was called
    
    In case of device_register() has been called we should call put_device()
    to correctly free the memory allocated for this device, but mdiobus_free()
    calls just kfree(dev) in case of MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED state
    
    To avoid this behaviour we need to set bus->state to MDIOBUS_UNREGISTERED
    _before_ calling device_register(), because put_device() should be
    called even in case of device_register() failure.

    ARM: dts: omap3430-sdp: Fix NAND device node
    
    commit 80d680fdccba214e8106dc1aa33de5207ad75394 upstream.
    
    Nand is on CS1 so reg properties first field should be 1 not 0.

    nfsd4: Handle the NFSv4 READDIR 'dircount' hint being zero
    
    commit f2e717d655040d632c9015f19aa4275f8b16e7f2 upstream.
    
    RFC3530 notes that the 'dircount' field may be zero, in which case the
    recommendation is to ignore it, and only enforce the 'maxcount' field.
    In RFC5661, this recommendation to ignore a zero valued field becomes a
    requirement.

    ovl: fix missing negative dentry check in ovl_rename()
    
    commit a295aef603e109a47af355477326bd41151765b6 upstream.
    
    The following reproducer
    
      mkdir lower upper work merge
      touch lower/old
      touch lower/new
      mount -t overlay overlay -olowerdir=lower,upperdir=upper,workdir=work merge
      rm merge/new
      mv merge/old merge/new & unlink upper/new
    
    may result in this race:
    
    PROCESS A:
      rename("merge/old", "merge/new");
      overwrite=true,ovl_lower_positive(old)=true,
      ovl_dentry_is_whiteout(new)=true -> flags |= RENAME_EXCHANGE
    
    PROCESS B:
      unlink("upper/new");
    
    PROCESS A:
      lookup newdentry in new_upperdir
      call vfs_rename() with negative newdentry and RENAME_EXCHANGE
    
    Fix by adding the missing check for negative newdentry.

    USB: cdc-acm: fix break reporting
    
    commit 58fc1daa4d2e9789b9ffc880907c961ea7c062cc upstream.
    
    A recent change that started reporting break events forgot to push the
    event to the line discipline, which meant that a detected break would
    not be reported until further characters had been receive (the port
    could even have been closed and reopened in between).

    USB: cdc-acm: fix racy tty buffer accesses
    
    commit 65a205e6113506e69a503b61d97efec43fc10fd7 upstream.
    
    A recent change that started reporting break events to the line
    discipline caused the tty-buffer insertions to no longer be serialised
    by inserting events also from the completion handler for the interrupt
    endpoint.
    
    Completion calls for distinct endpoints are not guaranteed to be
    serialised. For example, in case a host-controller driver uses
    bottom-half completion, the interrupt and bulk-in completion handlers
    can end up running in parallel on two CPUs (high-and low-prio tasklets,
    respectively) thereby breaking the tty layer's single producer
    assumption.
    
    Fix this by holding the read lock also when inserting characters from
    the bulk endpoint.

    Partially revert "usb: Kconfig: using select for USB_COMMON dependency"
    
    commit 4d1aa9112c8e6995ef2c8a76972c9671332ccfea upstream.
    
    This reverts commit cb9c1cfc86926d0e86d19c8e34f6c23458cd3478 for
    USB_LED_TRIG.  This config symbol has bool type and enables extra code
    in usb_common itself, not a separate driver.  Enabling it should not
    force usb_common to be built-in!
