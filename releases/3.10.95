    KEYS: Fix keyring ref leak in join_session_keyring()
    
    commit 23567fd052a9abb6d67fe8e7a9ccdd9800a540f2 upstream.
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-0728.
    
    If a thread is asked to join as a session keyring the keyring that's already
    set as its session, we leak a keyring reference.
    
    This can be tested with the following program:
    
            #include <stddef.h>
            #include <stdio.h>
            #include <sys/types.h>
            #include <keyutils.h>
    
            int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
            {
                    int i = 0;
                    key_serial_t serial;
    
                    serial = keyctl(KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING,
                                    "leaked-keyring");
                    if (serial < 0) {
                            perror("keyctl");
                            return -1;
                    }
    
                    if (keyctl(KEYCTL_SETPERM, serial,
                               KEY_POS_ALL | KEY_USR_ALL) < 0) {
                            perror("keyctl");
                            return -1;
                    }
    
                    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
                            serial = keyctl(KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING,
                                            "leaked-keyring");
                            if (serial < 0) {
                                    perror("keyctl");
                                    return -1;
                            }
                    }
    
                    return 0;
            }
    
    If, after the program has run, there something like the following line in
    /proc/keys:
    
    3f3d898f I--Q---   100 perm 3f3f0000     0     0 keyring   leaked-keyring: empty
    
    with a usage count of 100 * the number of times the program has been run,
    then the kernel is malfunctioning.  If leaked-keyring has zero usages or
    has been garbage collected, then the problem is fixed.

    KEYS: Fix race between read and revoke
    
    commit b4a1b4f5047e4f54e194681125c74c0aa64d637d upstream.
    
    This fixes CVE-2015-7550.
    
    There's a race between keyctl_read() and keyctl_revoke().  If the revoke
    happens between keyctl_read() checking the validity of a key and the key's
    semaphore being taken, then the key type read method will see a revoked key.
    
    This causes a problem for the user-defined key type because it assumes in
    its read method that there will always be a payload in a non-revoked key
    and doesn't check for a NULL pointer.
    
    Fix this by making keyctl_read() check the validity of a key after taking
    semaphore instead of before.
    
    I think the bug was introduced with the original keyrings code.
    
    This was discovered by a multithreaded test program generated by syzkaller
    (http://github.com/google/syzkaller).  Here's a cleaned up version:
    
            #include <sys/types.h>
            #include <keyutils.h>
            #include <pthread.h>
            void *thr0(void *arg)
            {
                    key_serial_t key = (unsigned long)arg;
                    keyctl_revoke(key);
                    return 0;
            }
            void *thr1(void *arg)
            {
                    key_serial_t key = (unsigned long)arg;
                    char buffer[16];
                    keyctl_read(key, buffer, 16);
                    return 0;
            }
            int main()
            {
                    key_serial_t key = add_key("user", "%", "foo", 3, KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING);
                    pthread_t th[5];
                    pthread_create(&th[0], 0, thr0, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
                    pthread_create(&th[1], 0, thr1, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
                    pthread_create(&th[2], 0, thr0, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
                    pthread_create(&th[3], 0, thr1, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
                    pthread_join(th[0], 0);
                    pthread_join(th[1], 0);
                    pthread_join(th[2], 0);
                    pthread_join(th[3], 0);
                    return 0;
            }
    
    Build as:
    
            cc -o keyctl-race keyctl-race.c -lkeyutils -lpthread
    
    Run as:
    
            while keyctl-race; do :; done
    
    as it may need several iterations to crash the kernel.  The crash can be
    summarised as:
    
            BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000010

    KEYS: Fix crash when attempt to garbage collect an uninstantiated keyring
    
    commit f05819df10d7b09f6d1eb6f8534a8f68e5a4fe61 upstream.
    
    The following sequence of commands:
    
        i=`keyctl add user a a @s`
        keyctl request2 keyring foo bar @t
        keyctl unlink $i @s
    
    tries to invoke an upcall to instantiate a keyring if one doesn't already
    exist by that name within the user's keyring set.  However, if the upcall
    fails, the code sets keyring->type_data.reject_error to -ENOKEY or some
    other error code.  When the key is garbage collected, the key destroy
    function is called unconditionally and keyring_destroy() uses list_empty()
    on keyring->type_data.link - which is in a union with reject_error.
    Subsequently, the kernel tries to unlink the keyring from the keyring names
    list - which oopses like this:

    KEYS: Fix race between key destruction and finding a keyring by name
    
    commit 94c4554ba07adbdde396748ee7ae01e86cf2d8d7 upstream.
    
    There appears to be a race between:
    
     (1) key_gc_unused_keys() which frees key->security and then calls
         keyring_destroy() to unlink the name from the name list
    
     (2) find_keyring_by_name() which calls key_permission(), thus accessing
         key->security, on a key before checking to see whether the key usage is 0
         (ie. the key is dead and might be cleaned up).
    
    Fix this by calling ->destroy() before cleaning up the core key data -
    including key->security.

    af_unix: Revert 'lock_interruptible' in stream receive code
    
    [ Upstream commit 3822b5c2fc62e3de8a0f33806ff279fb7df92432 ]
    
    With b3ca9b02b00704053a38bfe4c31dbbb9c13595d0, the AF_UNIX SOCK_STREAM
    receive code was changed from using mutex_lock(&u->readlock) to
    mutex_lock_interruptible(&u->readlock) to prevent signals from being
    delayed for an indefinite time if a thread sleeping on the mutex
    happened to be selected for handling the signal. But this was never a
    problem with the stream receive code (as opposed to its datagram
    counterpart) as that never went to sleep waiting for new messages with the
    mutex held and thus, wouldn't cause secondary readers to block on the
    mutex waiting for the sleeping primary reader. As the interruptible
    locking makes the code more complicated in exchange for no benefit,
    change it back to using mutex_lock.

    net: add validation for the socket syscall protocol argument
    
    [ Upstream commit 79462ad02e861803b3840cc782248c7359451cd9 ]
    
    郭永刚 reported that one could simply crash the kernel as root by
    using a simple program:
    
            int socket_fd;
            struct sockaddr_in addr;
            addr.sin_port = 0;
            addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
            addr.sin_family = 10;
    
            socket_fd = socket(10,3,0x40000000);
            connect(socket_fd , &addr,16);
    
    AF_INET, AF_INET6 sockets actually only support 8-bit protocol
    identifiers. inet_sock's skc_protocol field thus is sized accordingly,
    thus larger protocol identifiers simply cut off the higher bits and
    store a zero in the protocol fields.
    
    This could lead to e.g. NULL function pointer because as a result of
    the cut off inet_num is zero and we call down to inet_autobind, which
    is NULL for raw sockets.

    ipv6: sctp: clone options to avoid use after free
    
    [ Upstream commit 9470e24f35ab81574da54e69df90c1eb4a96b43f ]
    
    SCTP is lacking proper np->opt cloning at accept() time.
    
    TCP and DCCP use ipv6_dup_options() helper, do the same
    in SCTP.
    
    We might later factorize this code in a common helper to avoid
    future mistakes.

    sctp: update the netstamp_needed counter when copying sockets
    
    [ Upstream commit 01ce63c90170283a9855d1db4fe81934dddce648 ]
    
    Dmitry Vyukov reported that SCTP was triggering a WARN on socket destroy
    related to disabling sock timestamp.
    
    When SCTP accepts an association or peel one off, it copies sock flags
    but forgot to call net_enable_timestamp() if a packet timestamping flag
    was copied, leading to extra calls to net_disable_timestamp() whenever
    such clones were closed.
    
    The fix is to call net_enable_timestamp() whenever we copy a sock with
    that flag on, like tcp does.

    atl1c driver is doing order-4 allocation with GFP_ATOMIC

    atl1c_setup_ring_resources() is called from .open() function, and

    Some USB device / host controller combinations seem to have problems
    with Link Power Management.  For example, Steinar found that his xHCI
    controller wouldn't handle bandwidth calculations correctly for two
    video cards simultaneously when LPM was enabled, even though the bus
    had plenty of bandwidth available.
    
    This patch introduces a new quirk flag for devices that should remain
    disabled for LPM, and creates quirk entries for Steinar's devices.

    USB: cdc_acm: Ignore Infineon Flash Loader utility
    
    commit f33a7f72e5fc033daccbb8d4753d7c5c41a4d67b upstream.
    
    Some modems, such as the Telit UE910, are using an Infineon Flash Loader
    utility. It has two interfaces, 2/2/0 (Abstract Modem) and 10/0/0 (CDC
    Data). The latter can be used as a serial interface to upgrade the
    firmware of the modem. However, that isn't possible when the cdc-acm
    driver takes control of the device.
    
    The following is an explanation of the behaviour by Daniele Palmas during
    discussion on linux-usb.
    
    "This is what happens when the device is turned on (without modifying
    the drivers):
    
    [155492.352031] usb 1-3: new high-speed USB device number 27 using ehci-pci
    [155492.485429] usb 1-3: config 1 interface 0 altsetting 0 endpoint 0x81 has an invalid bInterval 255, changing to 11
    [155492.485436] usb 1-3: New USB device found, idVendor=058b, idProduct=0041
    [155492.485439] usb 1-3: New USB device strings: Mfr=0, Product=0, SerialNumber=0
    [155492.485952] cdc_acm 1-3:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
    
    This is the flashing device that is caught by the cdc-acm driver. Once
    the ttyACM appears, the application starts sending a magic string
    (simple write on the file descriptor) to keep the device in flashing
    mode. If this magic string is not properly received in a certain time
    interval, the modem goes on in normal operative mode:
    
    [155493.748094] usb 1-3: USB disconnect, device number 27
    [155494.916025] usb 1-3: new high-speed USB device number 28 using ehci-pci
    [155495.059978] usb 1-3: New USB device found, idVendor=1bc7, idProduct=0021
    [155495.059983] usb 1-3: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
    [155495.059986] usb 1-3: Product: 6 CDC-ACM + 1 CDC-ECM
    [155495.059989] usb 1-3: Manufacturer: Telit
    [155495.059992] usb 1-3: SerialNumber: 359658044004697
    [155495.138958] cdc_acm 1-3:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
    [155495.140832] cdc_acm 1-3:1.2: ttyACM1: USB ACM device

    Using the cdc-acm driver, the string, though being sent in the same way
    than using the usb-serial-simple driver (I can confirm that the data is
    passing properly since I used an hw usb sniffer), does not make the
    device to stay in flashing mode."

    firewire: ohci: fix JMicron JMB38x IT context discovery
    
    commit 100ceb66d5c40cc0c7018e06a9474302470be73c upstream.
    
    Reported by Clifford and Craig for JMicron OHCI-1394 + SDHCI combo
    controllers:  Often or even most of the time, the controller is
    initialized with the message "added OHCI v1.10 device as card 0, 4 IR +
    0 IT contexts, quirks 0x10".  With 0 isochronous transmit DMA contexts
    (IT contexts), applications like audio output are impossible.
    
    However, OHCI-1394 demands that at least 4 IT contexts are implemented
    by the link layer controller, and indeed JMicron JMB38x do implement
    four of them.  Only their IsoXmitIntMask register is unreliable at early
    access.
    
    With my own JMB381 single function controller I found:
      - I can reproduce the problem with a lower probability than Craig's.
      - If I put a loop around the section which clears and reads
        IsoXmitIntMask, then either the first or the second attempt will
        return the correct initial mask of 0x0000000f.  I never encountered
        a case of needing more than a second attempt.
      - Consequently, if I put a dummy reg_read(...IsoXmitIntMaskSet)
        before the first write, the subsequent read will return the correct
        result.
      - If I merely ignore a wrong read result and force the known real
        result, later isochronous transmit DMA usage works just fine.
    
    So let's just fix this chip bug up by the latter method.  Tested with
    JMB381 on kernel 3.13 and 4.3.
    
    Since OHCI-1394 generally requires 4 IT contexts at a minium, this
    workaround is simply applied whenever the initial read of IsoXmitIntMask
    returns 0, regardless whether it's a JMicron chip or not.  I never heard
    of this issue together with any other chip though.
    
    I am not 100% sure that this fix works on the OHCI-1394 part of JMB380
    and JMB388 combo controllers exactly the same as on the JMB381 single-
    function controller, but so far I haven't had a chance to let an owner
    of a combo chip run a patched kernel.
    
    Strangely enough, IsoRecvIntMask is always reported correctly, even
    though it is probed right before IsoXmitIntMask.

    ext4, jbd2: ensure entering into panic after recording an error in superblock
    
    commit 4327ba52afd03fc4b5afa0ee1d774c9c5b0e85c5 upstream.
    
    If a EXT4 filesystem utilizes JBD2 journaling and an error occurs, the
    journaling will be aborted first and the error number will be recorded
    into JBD2 superblock and, finally, the system will enter into the
    panic state in "errors=panic" option.  But, in the rare case, this
    sequence is little twisted like the below figure and it will happen
    that the system enters into panic state, which means the system reset
    in mobile environment, before completion of recording an error in the
    journal superblock. In this case, e2fsck cannot recognize that the
    filesystem failure occurred in the previous run and the corruption
    wouldn't be fixed.
    
    Task A                        Task B
    ext4_handle_error()
    -> jbd2_journal_abort()
      -> __journal_abort_soft()

    Btrfs: fix race leading to BUG_ON when running delalloc for nodatacow
    
    commit 1d512cb77bdbda80f0dd0620a3b260d697fd581d upstream.
    
    If we are using the NO_HOLES feature, we have a tiny time window when
    running delalloc for a nodatacow inode where we can race with a concurrent
    link or xattr add operation leading to a BUG_ON.
    
    This happens because at run_delalloc_nocow() we end up casting a leaf item
    of type BTRFS_INODE_[REF|EXTREF]_KEY or of type BTRFS_XATTR_ITEM_KEY to a
    file extent item (struct btrfs_file_extent_item) and then analyse its
    extent type field, which won't match any of the expected extent types
    (values BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_[REG|PREALLOC|INLINE]) and therefore trigger an
    explicit BUG_ON(1).
    
    The following sequence diagram shows how the race happens when running a
    no-cow dellaloc range [4K, 8K[ for inode 257 and we have the following
    neighbour leafs:
    
                 Leaf X (has N items)                    Leaf Y
    
     [ ... (257 INODE_ITEM 0) (257 INODE_REF 256) ]  [ (257 EXTENT_DATA 8192), ... ]
                  slot N - 2         slot N - 1              slot 0
    
     (Note the implicit hole for inode 257 regarding the [0, 8K[ range)
    
           CPU 1                                         CPU 2
    
     run_dealloc_nocow()
       btrfs_lookup_file_extent()
         --> searches for a key with value
             (257 EXTENT_DATA 4096) in the
             fs/subvol tree
         --> returns us a path with
             path->nodes[0] == leaf X and
             path->slots[0] == N
    
       because path->slots[0] is >=
       btrfs_header_nritems(leaf X), it
       calls btrfs_next_leaf()
    
       btrfs_next_leaf()
         --> releases the path
    
                                                  hard link added to our inode,
                                                  with key (257 INODE_REF 500)
                                                  added to the end of leaf X,
                                                  so leaf X now has N + 1 keys
    
         --> searches for the key
             (257 INODE_REF 256), because
             it was the last key in leaf X
             before it released the path,
             with path->keep_locks set to 1
    
         --> ends up at leaf X again and
             it verifies that the key
             (257 INODE_REF 256) is no longer
             the last key in the leaf, so it
             returns with path->nodes[0] ==
             leaf X and path->slots[0] == N,
             pointing to the new item with
             key (257 INODE_REF 500)
    
       the loop iteration of run_dealloc_nocow()
       does not break out the loop and continues
       because the key referenced in the path
       at path->nodes[0] and path->slots[0] is
       for inode 257, its type is < BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY
       and its offset (500) is less then our delalloc
       range's end (8192)
    
       the item pointed by the path, an inode reference item,
       is (incorrectly) interpreted as a file extent item and
       we get an invalid extent type, leading to the BUG_ON(1):
    
       if (extent_type == BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_REG ||
          extent_type == BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_PREALLOC) {
           (...)
       } else if (extent_type == BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_INLINE) {
           (...)
       } else {
           BUG_ON(1)
       }
    
    The same can happen if a xattr is added concurrently and ends up having
    a key with an offset smaller then the delalloc's range end.
    
    So fix this by skipping keys with a type smaller than
    BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY.

    [ Upstream commit 602dd62dfbda3e63a2d6a3cbde953ebe82bf5087 ]
    
    Dmitry Vyukov reported a memory leak using IPV6 SCTP sockets.
    
    We need to call inet6_destroy_sock() to properly release

    ipv6: distinguish frag queues by device for multicast and link-local packets
    
    [ Upstream commit 264640fc2c5f4f913db5c73fa3eb1ead2c45e9d7 ]
    
    If a fragmented multicast packet is received on an ethernet device which
    has an active macvlan on top of it, each fragment is duplicated and
    received both on the underlying device and the macvlan. If some
    fragments for macvlan are processed before the whole packet for the
    underlying device is reassembled, the "overlapping fragments" test in
    ip6_frag_queue() discards the whole fragment queue.
    
    To resolve this, add device ifindex to the search key and require it to
    match reassembling multicast packets and packets to link-local
    addresses.
    
    Note: similar patch has been already submitted by Yoshifuji Hideaki in

    net, scm: fix PaX detected msg_controllen overflow in scm_detach_fds

    Further investigation showed that this can happen when an *odd* number of
    fds are being passed over AF_UNIX sockets.
    
    In these cases CMSG_LEN(i * sizeof(int)) and CMSG_SPACE(i * sizeof(int)),
    where i is the number of successfully passed fds, differ by 4 bytes due
    to the extra CMSG_ALIGN() padding in CMSG_SPACE() to an 8 byte boundary
    on 64 bit. The padding is used to align subsequent cmsg headers in the
    control buffer.
    
    When the control buffer passed in from the receiver side *lacks* these 4
    bytes (e.g. due to buggy/wrong API usage), then msg->msg_controllen will
    overflow in scm_detach_fds():
    
      int cmlen = CMSG_LEN(i * sizeof(int));  <--- cmlen w/o tail-padding
      err = put_user(SOL_SOCKET, &cm->cmsg_level);
      if (!err)
        err = put_user(SCM_RIGHTS, &cm->cmsg_type);
      if (!err)
        err = put_user(cmlen, &cm->cmsg_len);
      if (!err) {
        cmlen = CMSG_SPACE(i * sizeof(int));  <--- cmlen w/ 4 byte extra tail-padding
        msg->msg_control += cmlen;
        msg->msg_controllen -= cmlen;         <--- iff no tail-padding space here ...
      }                                            ... wrap-around
    
    F.e. it will wrap to a length of 18446744073709551612 bytes in case the
    receiver passed in msg->msg_controllen of 20 bytes, and the sender
    properly transferred 1 fd to the receiver, so that its CMSG_LEN results
    in 20 bytes and CMSG_SPACE in 24 bytes.
    
    In case of MSG_CMSG_COMPAT (scm_detach_fds_compat()), I haven't seen an
    issue in my tests as alignment seems always on 4 byte boundary. Same
    should be in case of native 32 bit, where we end up with 4 byte boundaries
    as well.
    
    In practice, passing msg->msg_controllen of 20 to recvmsg() while receiving
    a single fd would mean that on successful return, msg->msg_controllen is
    being set by the kernel to 24 bytes instead, thus more than the input
    buffer advertised. It could f.e. become an issue if such application later
    on zeroes or copies the control buffer based on the returned msg->msg_controllen
    elsewhere.
    
    Maximum number of fds we can send is a hard upper limit SCM_MAX_FD (253).
    
    Going over the code, it seems like msg->msg_controllen is not being read
    after scm_detach_fds() in scm_recv() anymore by the kernel, good!
    
    Relevant recvmsg() handler are unix_dgram_recvmsg() (unix_seqpacket_recvmsg())
    and unix_stream_recvmsg(). Both return back to their recvmsg() caller,
    and ___sys_recvmsg() places the updated length, that is, new msg_control -
    old msg_control pointer into msg->msg_controllen (hence the 24 bytes seen
    in the example).
    
    Long time ago, Wei Yongjun fixed something related in commit 1ac70e7ad24a
    ("[NET]: Fix function put_cmsg() which may cause usr application memory
    overflow").
    
    RFC3542, section 20.2. says:
    
      The fields shown as "XX" are possible padding, between the cmsghdr
      structure and the data, and between the data and the next cmsghdr
      structure, if required by the implementation. While sending an
      application may or may not include padding at the end of last
      ancillary data in msg_controllen and implementations must accept both
      as valid. On receiving a portable application must provide space for
      padding at the end of the last ancillary data as implementations may
      copy out the padding at the end of the control message buffer and
      include it in the received msg_controllen. When recvmsg() is called
      if msg_controllen is too small for all the ancillary data items
      including any trailing padding after the last item an implementation
      may set MSG_CTRUNC.
    
    Since we didn't place MSG_CTRUNC for already quite a long time, just do
    the same as in 1ac70e7ad24a to avoid an overflow.
    
    Btw, even man-page author got this wrong :/ See db939c9b26e9 ("cmsg.3: Fix
    error in SCM_RIGHTS code sample"). Some people must have copied this (?),
    thus it got triggered in the wild (reported several times during boot by
    David and HacKurx).
    
    No Fixes tag this time as pre 2002 (that is, pre history tree).

    Dmitry provided a syzkaller (http://github.com/google/syzkaller)

    WARN_ON(tp->copied_seq != tp->rcv_nxt &&
            !(flags & (MSG_PEEK | MSG_TRUNC)));
    
    His program is specifically attempting a Cross SYN TCP exchange,
    that we support (for the pleasure of hackers ?), but it looks we
    lack proper tcp->copied_seq initialization.

    net: qmi_wwan: add XS Stick W100-2 from 4G Systems

    4gsystems sells two total different LTE-surfsticks under the same name.
    ..
    The newer version of XS Stick W100 is from "omega"
    ..
    Under windows the driver switches to the same ID, and uses MI03\6 for
    network and MI01\6 for modem.

    There is also ttyUSB0, but it is not usable, at least not for at.
    
    The device works well with qmi and ModemManager-NetworkManager.

    the OUTMCAST stat is double incremented, getting bumped once in the mcast code
    itself, and again in the common ip output path.  Remove the mcast bump, as its

    sctp: translate host order to network order when setting a hmacid
    
    [ Upstream commit ed5a377d87dc4c87fb3e1f7f698cba38cd893103 ]
    
    now sctp auth cannot work well when setting a hmacid manually, which
    is caused by that we didn't use the network order for hmacid, so fix
    it by adding the transformation in sctp_auth_ep_set_hmacs.
    
    even we set hmacid with the network order in userspace, it still
    can't work, because of this condition in sctp_auth_ep_set_hmacs():
    
                    if (id > SCTP_AUTH_HMAC_ID_MAX)
                            return -EOPNOTSUPP;
    
    so this wasn't working before and thus it won't break compatibility.

    unix: avoid use-after-free in ep_remove_wait_queue
    
    [ Upstream commit 7d267278a9ece963d77eefec61630223fce08c6c ]
    
    Rainer Weikusat <rweikusat@mobileactivedefense.com> writes:
    An AF_UNIX datagram socket being the client in an n:1 association with
    some server socket is only allowed to send messages to the server if the
    receive queue of this socket contains at most sk_max_ack_backlog
    datagrams. This implies that prospective writers might be forced to go
    to sleep despite none of the message presently enqueued on the server
    receive queue were sent by them. In order to ensure that these will be
    woken up once space becomes again available, the present unix_dgram_poll
    routine does a second sock_poll_wait call with the peer_wait wait queue
    of the server socket as queue argument (unix_dgram_recvmsg does a wake
    up on this queue after a datagram was received). This is inherently
    problematic because the server socket is only guaranteed to remain alive
    for as long as the client still holds a reference to it. In case the
    connection is dissolved via connect or by the dead peer detection logic
    in unix_dgram_sendmsg, the server socket may be freed despite "the
    polling mechanism" (in particular, epoll) still has a pointer to the
    corresponding peer_wait queue. There's no way to forcibly deregister a
    wait queue with epoll.
    
    Based on an idea by Jason Baron, the patch below changes the code such
    that a wait_queue_t belonging to the client socket is enqueued on the
    peer_wait queue of the server whenever the peer receive queue full
    condition is detected by either a sendmsg or a poll. A wake up on the
    peer queue is then relayed to the ordinary wait queue of the client
    socket via wake function. The connection to the peer wait queue is again
    dissolved if either a wake up is about to be relayed or the client
    socket reconnects or a dead peer is detected or the client socket is
    itself closed. This enables removing the second sock_poll_wait from
    unix_dgram_poll, thus avoiding the use-after-free, while still ensuring
    that no blocked writer sleeps forever.
