    net: fec: fix clock count mis-match
    
    commit a31eda65ba210741b598044d045480494d0ed52a upstream.
    
    pm_runtime_put_autosuspend in probe will call runtime suspend to
    disable clks automatically if CONFIG_PM is defined. (If CONFIG_PM
    is not defined, its implementation will be empty, then runtime
    suspend will not be called.)
    
    Therefore, we can call pm_runtime_get_sync to runtime resume it
    first to enable clks, which matches the runtime suspend. (Only when
    CONFIG_PM is defined, otherwise pm_runtime_get_sync will also be
    empty, then runtime resume will not be called.)
    
    Then it is fine to disable clks without causing clock count mis-match.

    platform/x86: hp-wmi: Fix ACPI errors caused by passing 0 as input size
    
    commit f3e4f3fc8ee9729c4b1b27a478c68b713df53c0c upstream.
    
    The AML code implementing the WMI methods creates a variable length
    field to hold the input data we pass like this:
    
            CreateDWordField (Arg1, 0x0C, DSZI)
            Local5 = DSZI /* \HWMC.DSZI */
            CreateField (Arg1, 0x80, (Local5 * 0x08), DAIN)
    
    If we pass 0 as bios_args.datasize argument then (Local5 * 0x08)
    is 0 which results in these errors:
    
    [   71.973305] ACPI BIOS Error (bug): Attempt to CreateField of length zero (20190816/dsopcode-133)
    [   71.973332] ACPI Error: Aborting method \HWMC due to previous error (AE_AML_OPERAND_VALUE) (20190816/psparse-529)
    [   71.973413] ACPI Error: Aborting method \_SB.WMID.WMAA due to previous error (AE_AML_OPERAND_VALUE) (20190816/psparse-529)
    
    And in our HPWMI_WIRELESS2_QUERY calls always failing. for read commands
    like HPWMI_WIRELESS2_QUERY the DSZI value is not used / checked, except for
    read commands where extra input is needed to specify exactly what to read.
    
    So for HPWMI_WIRELESS2_QUERY we can safely pass the size of the expected
    output as insize to hp_wmi_perform_query(), as we are already doing for all
    other HPWMI_READ commands we send. Doing so fixes these errors.

    platform/x86: hp-wmi: Fix ACPI errors caused by too small buffer
    
    commit 16245db1489cd9aa579506f64afeeeb13d825a93 upstream.
    
    The HP WMI calls may take up to 128 bytes of data as input, and
    the AML methods implementing the WMI calls, declare a couple of fields for
    accessing input in different sizes, specifycally the HWMC method contains:
    
            CreateField (Arg1, 0x80, 0x0400, D128)
    
    Even though we do not use any of the WMI command-types which need a buffer
    of this size, the APCI interpreter still tries to create it as it is
    declared in generoc code at the top of the HWMC method which runs before
    the code looks at which command-type is requested.
    
    This results in many of these errors on many different HP laptop models:
    
    [   14.459261] ACPI Error: Field [D128] at 1152 exceeds Buffer [NULL] size 160 (bits) (20170303/dsopcode-236)
    [   14.459268] ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed [\HWMC] (Node ffff8edcc61507f8), AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT (20170303/psparse-543)
    [   14.459279] ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed [\_SB.WMID.WMAA] (Node ffff8edcc61523c0), AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT (20170303/psparse-543)
    
    This commit increases the size of the data element of the bios_args struct
    to 128 bytes fixing these errors.

    commit cc832dc8e32785a730ba07c3a357e17c201a5df8 upstream.
    
    When a period length is not multiple of FIFO some data may be stuck
    within FIFO.
    
    Burst/FIFO Threshold/Period or buffer length check has to be hardened
    
    In any case DMA will grant any request from client but will degraded
    any parameters whether awkward.

    HID: core: check whether Usage Page item is after Usage ID items
    
    commit 1cb0d2aee26335d0bccf29100c7bed00ebece851 upstream.
    
    Upstream commit 58e75155009c ("HID: core: move Usage Page concatenation
    to Main item") adds support for Usage Page item after Usage ID items
    (such as keyboards manufactured by Primax).
    
    Usage Page concatenation in Main item works well for following report
    descriptor patterns:
    
        USAGE_PAGE (Keyboard)                   05 07
        USAGE_MINIMUM (Keyboard LeftControl)    19 E0
        USAGE_MAXIMUM (Keyboard Right GUI)      29 E7
        LOGICAL_MINIMUM (0)                     15 00
        LOGICAL_MAXIMUM (1)                     25 01
        REPORT_SIZE (1)                         75 01
        REPORT_COUNT (8)                        95 08
        INPUT (Data,Var,Abs)                    81 02
    
    -------------
    
        USAGE_MINIMUM (Keyboard LeftControl)    19 E0
        USAGE_MAXIMUM (Keyboard Right GUI)      29 E7
        LOGICAL_MINIMUM (0)                     15 00
        LOGICAL_MAXIMUM (1)                     25 01
        REPORT_SIZE (1)                         75 01
        REPORT_COUNT (8)                        95 08
        USAGE_PAGE (Keyboard)                   05 07

    But it makes the parser act wrong for the following report
    descriptor pattern(such as some Gamepads):
    
        USAGE_PAGE (Button)                     05 09
        USAGE (Button 1)                        09 01
        USAGE (Button 2)                        09 02
        USAGE (Button 4)                        09 04
        USAGE (Button 5)                        09 05
        USAGE (Button 7)                        09 07
        USAGE (Button 8)                        09 08
        USAGE (Button 14)                       09 0E
        USAGE (Button 15)                       09 0F
        USAGE (Button 13)                       09 0D
        USAGE_PAGE (Consumer Devices)           05 0C
        USAGE (Back)                            0a 24 02
        USAGE (HomePage)                        0a 23 02

        LOGICAL_MAXIMUM (1)                     25 01

        INPUT (Data,Var,Abs)                    81 02
    
    With Usage Page concatenation in Main item, parser recognizes all the
    11 Usages as consumer keys, it is not the HID device's real intention.
    
    This patch checks whether Usage Page is really defined after Usage ID
    items by comparing usage page using status.
    
    Usage Page concatenation on currently defined Usage Page will always
    do in local parsing when Usage ID items encountered.
    
    When Main item is parsing, concatenation will do again with last
    defined Usage Page if this page has not been used in the previous
    usages concatenation.

    tcp: exit if nothing to retransmit on RTO timeout
    
    commit 88f8598d0a302a08380eadefd09b9f5cb1c4c428 upstream.
    
    Previously TCP only warns if its RTO timer fires and the
    retransmission queue is empty, but it'll cause null pointer
    reference later on. It's better to avoid such catastrophic failure
    and simply exit with a warning.

    mtd: spi-nor: cast to u64 to avoid uint overflows
    
    commit 84a1c2109d23df3543d96231c4fee1757299bb1a upstream.
    
    The "params->size" is defined as "u64".
    And "info->sector_size" and "info->n_sectors" are defined as
    unsigned int and u16.
    Thus, u64 data might have strange data(loss data) if the result
    overflows an unsigned int.
    This patch casts "info->sector_size" to an u64.

    ext4: add more paranoia checking in ext4_expand_extra_isize handling
    
    commit 4ea99936a1630f51fc3a2d61a58ec4a1c4b7d55a upstream.
    
    It's possible to specify a non-zero s_want_extra_isize via debugging
    option, and this can cause bad things(tm) to happen when using a file
    system with an inode size of 128 bytes.
    
    Add better checking when the file system is mounted, as well as when
    we are actually doing the trying to do the inode expansion.

    [ Upstream commit 14e54ab9143fa60794d13ea0a66c792a2046a8f3 ]
    
    When a classful qdisc's child qdisc has set the flag
    TCQ_F_CPUSTATS (pfifo_fast for example), the child qdisc's
    cpu_bstats should be passed to gnet_stats_copy_basic(),
    but many classful qdisc didn't do that. As a result,
    `tc -s class show dev DEV` always return 0 for bytes and
    packets in this case.
    
    Pass the child qdisc's cpu_bstats to gnet_stats_copy_basic()
    to fix this issue.
    
    The qstats also has this problem, but it has been fixed
    in 5dd431b6b9 ("net: sched: introduce and use qstats read...")
    and bstats still remains buggy.

    It was caused by rhashtable access asoc->base.sk when sctp_assoc_migrate
    is changing its value. However, what rhashtable wants is netns from asoc
    base.sk, and for an asoc, its netns won't change once set. So we can
    simply fix it by caching netns since created.

    [ Upstream commit 4b67c515036313f3c3ecba3cb2babb9cbddb3f85 ]
    
    test_sockmap creates a temporary file to use for sendpage.
    this may fail for various reasons. Handle the error rather
    than segfault.

    openvswitch: remove another BUG_ON()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a574f86652a4540a2433946ba826ccb87f398cc ]
    
    If we can't build the flow del notification, we can simply delete
    the flow, no need to crash the kernel. Still keep a WARN_ON to
    preserve debuggability.
    
    Note: the BUG_ON() predates the Fixes tag, but this change
    can be applied only after the mentioned commit.

    Slip_open doesn't clean-up device which registration failed from the
    slip_devs device list. On next open after failure this list is iterated
    and freed device is accessed. Fix this by calling sl_free_netdev in error

    When user-space sets the OVS_UFID_F_OMIT_* flags, and the relevant

    attribute.
    Take the above in account when computing the flow command message

    net: psample: fix skb_over_panic
    
    [ Upstream commit 7eb9d7675c08937cd11d32b0b40442d4d731c5ee ]
    
    We need to calculate the skb size correctly otherwise we risk triggering
    skb_over_panic[1]. The issue is that data_len is added to the skb in a
    nl attribute, but we don't account for its header size (nlattr 4 bytes)
    and alignment. We account for it when calculating the total size in
    the > PSAMPLE_MAX_PACKET_SIZE comparison correctly, but not when
    allocating after that. The fix is simple - use nla_total_size() for
    data_len when allocating.
    
    To reproduce:
     $ tc qdisc add dev eth1 clsact
     $ tc filter add dev eth1 egress matchall action sample rate 1 group 1 trunc 129
     $ mausezahn eth1 -b bcast -a rand -c 1 -p 129

    macvlan: schedule bc_work even if error
    
    [ Upstream commit 1d7ea55668878bb350979c377fc72509dd6f5b21 ]
    
    While enqueueing a broadcast skb to port->bc_queue, schedule_work()
    is called to add port->bc_work, which processes the skbs in
    bc_queue, to "events" work queue. If port->bc_queue is full, the
    skb will be discarded and schedule_work(&port->bc_work) won't be
    called. However, if port->bc_queue is full and port->bc_work is not
    running or pending, port->bc_queue will keep full and schedule_work()
    won't be called any more, and all broadcast skbs to macvlan will be
    discarded. This case can happen:
    
    macvlan_process_broadcast() is the pending function of port->bc_work,
    it moves all the skbs in port->bc_queue to the queue "list", and
    processes the skbs in "list". During this, new skbs will keep being
    added to port->bc_queue in macvlan_broadcast_enqueue(), and
    port->bc_queue may already full when macvlan_process_broadcast()
    return. This may happen, especially when there are a lot of real-time
    threads and the process is preempted.
    
    Fix this by calling schedule_work(&port->bc_work) even if
    port->bc_work is full in macvlan_broadcast_enqueue().

    commit 79199002db5c571e335131856b3ff057ffd9f3c0 upstream.
    
    In case the completion function failes, unbind will be called
    which will call cancel_work for awb_work.
    This will trigger a WARN message from the workqueue.
    To avoid this, move the INIT_WORK call at the start of the completion
    function. This way the work is always initialized, which corresponds
    to the 'always canceled' unbind code.

    commit 1e4e25c4959c10728fbfcc6a286f9503d32dfe02 upstream.
    
    The subsystem will free the asd memory on notifier cleanup, if the asd is
    added to the notifier.
    However the memory is freed using kfree.
    Thus, we cannot allocate the asd using devm_*
    This can lead to crashes and problems.
    To test this issue, just return an error at probe, but cleanup the
    notifier beforehand.

    commit e926b12c611c2095c7976e2ed31753ad6eb5ff1a upstream.
    
    After a PWM is disposed by its user the per chip data becomes invalid.
    Clear the data in common code instead of the device drivers to get
    consistent behaviour. Before this patch only three of nine drivers
    cleaned up here.

    Errors are negative numbers. Using %u shows them as very large positive
    numbers such as 4294967277 that don't make sense. Use the %d format
    instead, and get a much nicer -19.

    thunderbolt: Power cycle the router if NVM authentication fails
    
    commit 7a7ebfa85f4fac349f3ab219538c44efe18b0cf6 upstream.
    
    On zang's Dell XPS 13 9370 after Thunderbolt NVM firmware upgrade the
    Thunderbolt controller did not come back as expected. Only after the
    system was rebooted it became available again. It is not entirely clear
    what happened but I suspect the new NVM firmware image authentication
    failed for some reason. Regardless of this the router needs to be power
    cycled if NVM authentication fails in order to get it fully functional
    again.
    
    This modifies the driver to issue a power cycle in case the NVM
    authentication fails immediately when dma_port_flash_update_auth()
    returns. We also need to call tb_switch_set_uuid() earlier to be able to
    fetch possible NVM authentication failure when DMA port is added.

    commit b7aa39a2ed0112d07fc277ebd24a08a7b2368ab9 upstream.
    
    The variable skb is released via kfree_skb() when the return value of
    _rtl92e_tx is not zero. However, after that, skb is accessed again to
    read its length, which may result in a use after free bug. This patch

    usb: dwc2: use a longer core rest timeout in dwc2_core_reset()

    Testing on different generations of Lantiq MIPS SoC based boards, showed
    that it takes up to 1500 us until the core reset bit is cleared.
    
    The driver from the vendor SDK (ifxhcd) uses a 1 second timeout. Use the
    same timeout to fix wrong hang detections and make the driver work for
    Lantiq MIPS SoCs.
    
    At least till kernel 4.14 the hanging reset only caused a warning but
    the driver was probed successful. With kernel 4.19 errors out with
    EBUSY.

    mm, gup: add missing refcount overflow checks on s390
    
    The mainline commit 8fde12ca79af ("mm: prevent get_user_pages() from
    overflowing page refcount") was backported to 4.19.y stable as commit
    d972ebbf42ba. The backport however missed that in 4.19, there are several
    arch-specific gup.c versions with fast gup implementations, so these do not
    prevent refcount overflow.
    
    This stable-only commit fixes the s390 version, and is based on the backport in
    SUSE SLES/openSUSE 4.12-based kernels.
    
    The remaining architectures with own gup.c are sparc, mips, sh. It's unlikely
    the known overflow scenario based on FUSE, which needs 140GB of RAM, is a
    problem for those architectures, and I don't feel confident enough to patch
    them.

    xdp: fix cpumap redirect SKB creation bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 676e4a6fe703f2dae699ee9d56f14516f9ada4ea ]
    
    We want to avoid leaking pointer info from xdp_frame (that is placed in
    top of frame) like commit 6dfb970d3dbd ("xdp: avoid leaking info stored in
    frame data on page reuse"), and followup commit 97e19cce05e5 ("bpf:
    reserve xdp_frame size in xdp headroom") that reserve this headroom.
    
    These changes also affected how cpumap constructed SKBs, as xdpf->headroom
    size changed, the skb data starting point were in-effect shifted with 32
    bytes (sizeof xdp_frame). This was still okay, as the cpumap frame_size
    calculation also included xdpf->headroom which were reduced by same amount.
    
    A bug was introduced in commit 77ea5f4cbe20 ("bpf/cpumap: make sure
    frame_size for build_skb is aligned if headroom isn't"), where the
    xdpf->headroom became part of the SKB_DATA_ALIGN rounding up. This
    round-up to find the frame_size is in principle still correct as it does
    not exceed the 2048 bytes frame_size (which is max for ixgbe and i40e),
    but the 32 bytes offset of pkt_data_start puts this over the 2048 bytes
    limit. This cause skb_shared_info to spill into next frame. It is a little
    hard to trigger, as the SKB need to use above 15 skb_shinfo->frags[] as
    far as I calculate. This does happen in practise for TCP streams when
    skb_try_coalesce() kicks in.
    
    KASAN can be used to detect these wrong memory accesses, I've seen:
     BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in skb_try_coalesce+0x3cb/0x760
     BUG: KASAN: wild-memory-access in skb_release_data+0xe2/0x250
    
    Driver veth also construct a SKB from xdp_frame in this way, but is not
    affected, as it doesn't reserve/deduct the room (used by xdp_frame) from
    the SKB headroom. Instead is clears the pointers via xdp_scrub_frame(),
    and allows SKB to use this area.
    
    The fix in this patch is to do like veth and instead allow SKB to (re)use
    the area occupied by xdp_frame, by clearing via xdp_scrub_frame().  (This
    does kill the idea of the SKB being able to access (mem) info from this
    area, but I guess it was a bad idea anyhow, and it was already killed by
    the veth changes.)

    [ Upstream commit 01929a65dfa13e18d89264ab1378854a91857e59 ]
    
    Currently the SMP PHY control execution result is checked, however the
    function result for the command is not.
    
    As such, we may be missing all potential errors, like SMP FUNCTION FAILED,
    INVALID REQUEST FRAME LENGTH, etc., meaning the PHY control request has
    failed.
    
    In some scenarios we need to ensure the function result is accepted, so add
    a check for this.

    [ Upstream commit 5c31b0c677531c2b8b4e29b3cfb923df663f39b7 ]
    
    When injecting 2 bit ECC error, it will cause fatal AXI interrupts. Before
    the recovery of SAS controller reset, the internal of SAS controller is in
    error. If CQ interrupts return at the time, actually it is exception CQ
    interrupt, and it may cause resource release in disorder.
    
    To avoid the exception situation, shutdown AXI bus after fatal AXI
    interrupt. In SAS controller reset, it will restart AXI bus. For later
    version of v3 hw, hardware will shutdown AXI bus for this situation, so
    just fix current ver of v3 hw.

    ACPI / APEI: Switch estatus pool to use vmalloc memory
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ac234be1a9497498e57d958f4251f5257b116b4 ]
    
    The ghes code is careful to parse and round firmware's advertised
    memory requirements for CPER records, up to a maximum of 64K.
    However when ghes_estatus_pool_expand() does its work, it splits
    the requested size into PAGE_SIZE granules.
    
    This means if firmware generates 5K of CPER records, and correctly
    describes this in the table, __process_error() will silently fail as it
    is unable to allocate more than PAGE_SIZE.
    
    Switch the estatus pool to vmalloc() memory. On x86 vmalloc() memory
    may fault and be fixed up by vmalloc_fault(). To prevent this call
    vmalloc_sync_all() before an NMI handler could discover the memory.

    ACPI / APEI: Don't wait to serialise with oops messages when panic()ing
    
    [ Upstream commit 78b0b690f6558ed788dccafa45965325dd11ba89 ]
    
    oops_begin() exists to group printk() messages with the oops message
    printed by die(). To reach this caller we know that platform firmware
    took this error first, then notified the OS via NMI with a 'panic'
    severity.
    
    Don't wait for another CPU to release the die-lock before panic()ing,
    our only goal is to print this fatal error and panic().
    
    This code is always called in_nmi(), and since commit 42a0bb3f7138
    ("printk/nmi: generic solution for safe printk in NMI"), it has been
    safe to call printk() from this context. Messages are batched in a
    per-cpu buffer and printed via irq-work, or a call back from panic().

       +----------+             +----------+
    
    According to Serial Attached SCSI - 1.1 (SAS-1.1):
    If an expander PHY attached to a SATA PHY is using a physical link rate
    greater than the maximum connection rate supported by the pathway from an
    STP initiator port, a management application client should use the SMP PHY
    CONTROL function (see 10.4.3.10) to set the PROGRAMMED MAXIMUM PHYSICAL
    LINK RATE field of the expander PHY to the maximum connection rate
    supported by the pathway from that STP initiator port.
    
    Currently libsas does not support checking if this condition occurs, nor
    rectifying when it does.
    
    Such a condition is not at all common, however it has been seen on some
    pre-silicon environments where the initiator PHY only supports a 1.5 Gbit
    maximum linkrate, mated with 12G expander PHYs and 3/6G SATA phy.
    
    This patch adds support for checking and rectifying this condition during
    initial device discovery only.
    
    We do support checking min pathway connection rate during revalidation phase,
    when new devices can be detected in the topology. However we do not
    support in the case of the the user reprogramming PHY linkrates, such that
    min pathway condition is not met/maintained.
    
    A note on root port PHY rates:
    The libsas root port PHY rates calculation is broken. Libsas sets the
    rates (min, max, and current linkrate) of a root port to the same linkrate
    of the first PHY member of that same port. In doing so, it assumes that
    all other PHYs which subsequently join the port to have the same
    negotiated linkrate, when they could actually be different.
    
    In practice this doesn't happen, as initiator and expander PHYs are
    normally initialised with consistent min/max linkrates.
    
    This has not caused an issue so far, so leave alone for now.

    apparmor: delete the dentry in aafs_remove() to avoid a leak
    
    [ Upstream commit 201218e4d3dfa1346e30997f48725acce3f26d01 ]
    
    Although the apparmorfs dentries are always dropped from the dentry cache
    when the usage count drops to zero, there is no guarantee that this will
    happen in aafs_remove(), as another thread might still be using it. In
    this scenario, this means that the dentry will temporarily continue to
    appear in the results of lookups, even after the call to aafs_remove().
    
    In the case of removal of a profile - it also causes simple_rmdir()
    on the profile directory to fail, as the directory won't be empty until
    the usage counts of all child dentries have decreased to zero. This
    results in the dentry for the profile directory leaking and appearing
    empty in the file system tree forever.

    kvm: properly check debugfs dentry before using it
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ed0579c12b2fe56a1fac2f712f58fc26c1dc49b ]
    
    debugfs can now report an error code if something went wrong instead of
    just NULL.  So if the return value is to be used as a "real" dentry, it
    needs to be checked if it is an error before dereferencing it.
    
    This is now happening because of ff9fb72bc077 ("debugfs: return error
    values, not NULL").  syzbot has found a way to trigger multiple debugfs
    files attempting to be created, which fails, and then the error code
    gets passed to dentry_path_raw() which obviously does not like it.

    [ Upstream commit c53336c8f5f29043fded57912cc06c24e12613d7 ]
    
    Logical block size is the lowest possible block size that the storage
    device can address. Max segment size is often related with controller's
    DMA capability. And it is reasonable to align max segment size with
    logical block size.
    
    SDHCI sets un-aligned max segment size, and causes ADMA error, so
    fix it by aligning max segment size with logical block size.

    sctp: don't compare hb_timer expire date before starting it
    
    [ Upstream commit d1f20c03f48102e52eb98b8651d129b83134cae4 ]
    
    hb_timer might not start at all for a particular transport because its
    start is conditional. In a result a node is not sending heartbeats.
    
    Function sctp_transport_reset_hb_timer has two roles:
        - initial start of hb_timer for a given transport,
        - update expire date of hb_timer for a given transport.
    The function is optimized to update timer's expire only if it is before
    a new calculated one but this comparison is invalid for a timer which
    has not yet started. Such a timer has expire == 0 and if a new expire
    value is bigger than (MAX_JIFFIES / 2 + 2) then "time_before" macro will
    fail and timer will not start resulting in no heartbeat packets send by
    the node.
    
    This was found when association was initialized within first 5 mins
    after system boot due to jiffies init value which is near to MAX_JIFFIES.
    
    Test kernel version: 4.9.154 (ARCH=arm)
    hb_timer.expire = 0;                //initialized, not started timer
    new_expire = MAX_JIFFIES / 2 + 2;   //or more
    time_before(hb_timer.expire, new_expire) == false

    net/smc: fix sender_free computation
    
    [ Upstream commit b8649efad879c69c7ab1f19ce8814fcabef1f72b ]
    
    In some scenarios a separate consumer cursor update is necessary.
    The decision is made in smc_tx_consumer_cursor_update(). The
    sender_free computation could be wrong:
    
    The rx confirmed cursor is always smaller than or equal to the
    rx producer cursor. The parameters in the smc_curs_diff() call
    have to be exchanged, otherwise sender_free might even be negative.
    
    And if more data arrives local_rx_ctrl.prod might be updated, enabling
    a cursor difference between local_rx_ctrl.prod and rx confirmed cursor
    larger than the RMB size. This case is not covered by smc_curs_diff().
    Thus function smc_curs_diff_large() is introduced here.
    
    If a recvmsg() is processed in parallel, local_tx_ctrl.cons might
    change during smc_cdc_msg_send. Make sure rx_curs_confirmed is updated
    with the actually sent local_tx_ctrl.cons value.

    xfs: end sync buffer I/O properly on shutdown error
    
    [ Upstream commit 465fa17f4a303d9fdff9eac4d45f91ece92e96ca ]
    
    As of commit e339dd8d8b ("xfs: use sync buffer I/O for sync delwri
    queue submission"), the delwri submission code uses sync buffer I/O
    for sync delwri I/O. Instead of waiting on async I/O to unlock the
    buffer, it uses the underlying sync I/O completion mechanism.
    
    If delwri buffer submission fails due to a shutdown scenario, an
    error is set on the buffer and buffer completion never occurs. This
    can cause xfs_buf_delwri_submit() to deadlock waiting on a
    completion event.
    
    We could check the error state before waiting on such buffers, but
    that doesn't serialize against the case of an error set via a racing
    I/O completion. Instead, invoke I/O completion in the shutdown case
    regardless of buffer I/O type.

    mm/hotplug: invalid PFNs from pfn_to_online_page()
    
    [ Upstream commit b13bc35193d9e7a8c050a24928ca5c9e7c9a009b ]
    
    On an arm64 ThunderX2 server, the first kmemleak scan would crash [1]
    with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_PGFLAGS=y due to page_to_nid() found a pfn that is
    not directly mapped (MEMBLOCK_NOMAP).  Hence, the page->flags is
    uninitialized.
    
    This is due to the commit 9f1eb38e0e11 ("mm, kmemleak: little
    optimization while scanning") starts to use pfn_to_online_page() instead
    of pfn_valid().  However, in the CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG=y case,
    pfn_to_online_page() does not call memblock_is_map_memory() while
    pfn_valid() does.
    
    Historically, the commit 68709f45385a ("arm64: only consider memblocks
    with NOMAP cleared for linear mapping") causes pages marked as nomap
    being no long reassigned to the new zone in memmap_init_zone() by
    calling __init_single_page().
    
    Since the commit 2d070eab2e82 ("mm: consider zone which is not fully
    populated to have holes") introduced pfn_to_online_page() and was
    designed to return a valid pfn only, but it is clearly broken on arm64.
    
    Therefore, let pfn_to_online_page() call pfn_valid_within(), so it can
    handle nomap thanks to the commit f52bb98f5ade ("arm64: mm: always
    enable CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE"), while it will be optimized away on
    architectures where have no HOLES_IN_ZONE.

    sent then return to user space. The wait is only done when no data was
    sent by the sendmsg() call.
    This fixes smc_tx_sendmsg() which tried to always send all user data and
    started to wait for free send buffer space when needed. During this wait
    the user space program was blocked in the sendmsg() call and hence not
    able to receive incoming data. When both sides were in such a situation
    then the connection stalled forever.

    net/smc: prevent races between smc_lgr_terminate() and smc_conn_free()
    
    [ Upstream commit 77f838ace755d2f466536c44dac6c856f62cd901 ]
    
    To prevent races between smc_lgr_terminate() and smc_conn_free() add an
    extra check of the lgr field before accessing it, and cancel a delayed
    free_work when a new smc connection is created.
    This fixes the problem that free_work cleared the lgr variable but
    smc_lgr_terminate() or smc_conn_free() still access it in parallel.

    decnet: fix DN_IFREQ_SIZE
    
    [ Upstream commit 50c2936634bcb1db78a8ca63249236810c11a80f ]
    
    Digging through the ioctls with Al because of the previous
    patches, we found that on 64-bit decnet's dn_dev_ioctl()
    is wrong, because struct ifreq::ifr_ifru is actually 24
    bytes (not 16 as expected from struct sockaddr) due to the
    ifru_map and ifru_settings members.
    
    Clearly, decnet expects the ioctl to be called with a struct
    like
      struct ifreq_dn {
        char ifr_name[IFNAMSIZ];
        struct sockaddr_dn ifr_addr;
      };
    
    since it does
      struct ifreq *ifr = ...;
      struct sockaddr_dn *sdn = (struct sockaddr_dn *)&ifr->ifr_addr;
    
    This means that DN_IFREQ_SIZE is too big for what it wants on
    64-bit, as it is
      sizeof(struct ifreq) - sizeof(struct sockaddr) +
      sizeof(struct sockaddr_dn)
    
    This assumes that sizeof(struct sockaddr) is the size of ifr_ifru
    but that isn't true.
    
    Fix this to use offsetof(struct ifreq, ifr_ifru).
    
    This indeed doesn't really matter much - the result is that we
    copy in/out 8 bytes more than we should on 64-bit platforms. In
    case the "struct ifreq_dn" lands just on the end of a page though
    it might lead to faults.
    
    As far as I can tell, it has been like this forever, so it seems
    very likely that nobody cares.

    sfc: suppress duplicate nvmem partition types in efx_ef10_mtd_probe
    
    [ Upstream commit 3366463513f544c12c6b88c13da4462ee9e7a1a1 ]
    
    Use a bitmap to keep track of which partition types we've already seen;
     for duplicates, return -EEXIST from efx_ef10_mtd_probe_partition() and
     thus skip adding that partition.
    Duplicate partitions occur because of the A/B backup scheme used by newer
     sfc NICs.  Prior to this patch they cause sysfs_warn_dup errors because
     they have the same name, causing us not to expose any MTDs at all.

    gpu: ipu-v3: pre: don't trigger update if buffer address doesn't change
    
    [ Upstream commit eb0200a4357da100064971689d3a0e9e3cf57f33 ]
    
    On a NOP double buffer update where current buffer address is the same
    as the next buffer address, the SDW_UPDATE bit clears too late. As we
    are now using this bit to determine when it is safe to signal flip
    completion to userspace this will delay completion of atomic commits
    where one plane doesn't change the buffer by a whole frame period.
    
    Fix this by remembering the last buffer address and just skip the
    double buffer update if it would not change the buffer address.

    PCI/MSI: Return -ENOSPC from pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity()
    
    [ Upstream commit 77f88abd4a6f73a1a68dbdc0e3f21575fd508fc3 ]
    
    The API of pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity() says it returns -ENOSPC if
    fewer than @min_vecs interrupt vectors are available for @dev.
    
    However, if a device supports MSI-X but not MSI and a caller requests
    @min_vecs that can't be satisfied by MSI-X, we previously returned -EINVAL
    (from the failed attempt to enable MSI), not -ENOSPC.
    
    When -ENOSPC is returned, callers may reduce the number IRQs they request
    and try again.  Most callers can use the @min_vecs and @max_vecs
    parameters to avoid this retry loop, but that doesn't work when using IRQ
    affinity "nr_sets" because rebalancing the sets is driver-specific.
    
    This return value bug has been present since pci_alloc_irq_vectors() was
    added in v4.10 by aff171641d18 ("PCI: Provide sensible IRQ vector
    alloc/free routines"), but it wasn't an issue because @min_vecs/@max_vecs
    removed the need for callers to iteratively reduce the number of IRQs
    requested and retry the allocation, so they didn't need to distinguish
    -ENOSPC from -EINVAL.
    
    In v5.0, 6da4b3ab9a6e ("genirq/affinity: Add support for allocating
    interrupt sets") added IRQ sets to the interface, which reintroduced the
    need to check for -ENOSPC and possibly reduce the number of IRQs requested
    and retry the allocation.

    ata: ahci: mvebu: do Armada 38x configuration only on relevant SoCs
    
    [ Upstream commit 96dbcb40e4b1a387cdb9b21f43638c759aebb5a4 ]
    
    At the beginning, only Armada 38x SoCs where supported by the
    ahci_mvebu.c driver. Commit 15d3ce7b63bd ("ata: ahci_mvebu: add
    support for Armada 3700 variant") introduced Armada 3700 support. As
    opposed to Armada 38x SoCs, the 3700 variants do not have to configure
    mbus and the regret option. This patch took care of avoiding such
    configuration when not needed in the probe function, but failed to do
    the same in the resume path. While doing so looks harmless by
    experience, let's clean the driver logic and avoid doing this useless
    configuration with Armada 3700 SoCs.
    
    Because the logic is very similar between these two places, it has
    been decided to factorize this code and put it in a "Armada 38x
    configuration function". This function is part of a new
    (per-compatible) platform data structure, so that the addition of such
    configuration function for Armada 3700 will be eased.

    Some devices may have big memory on chip, such as over 1G.  In some
    cases, the nbytes maybe bigger then 4M which is the bounday of the
    memory buddy system (4K default).
    
    So use vzalloc_node() to allocate the bitmap.  Also use vfree to free
    it.

    lib/genalloc.c: fix allocation of aligned buffer from non-aligned chunk
    
    [ Upstream commit 52fbf1134d479234d7e64ba9dcbaea23405f229e ]
    
    gen_pool_alloc_algo() uses different allocation functions implementing
    different allocation algorithms.  With gen_pool_first_fit_align()
    allocation function, the returned address should be aligned on the
    requested boundary.
    
    If chunk start address isn't aligned on the requested boundary, the
    returned address isn't aligned too.  The only way to get properly
    aligned address is to initialize the pool with chunks aligned on the
    requested boundary.  If want to have an ability to allocate buffers
    aligned on different boundaries (for example, 4K, 1MB, ...), the chunk
    start address should be aligned on the max possible alignment.
    
    This happens because gen_pool_first_fit_align() looks for properly
    aligned memory block without taking into account the chunk start address
    alignment.
    
    To fix this, we provide chunk start address to
    gen_pool_first_fit_align() and change its implementation such that it
    starts looking for properly aligned block with appropriate offset
    (exactly as is done in CMA).

    generate the platform devices, meaning the driver's attempt fails, and it

    core code has always done this for us.

    After finding a "firmware" dt node arm_sdei tries to match it's

    node. We are then incorrectly decreasing the refcount on that node
    again.
    
    This patch removes the unwarranted call to of_node_put().

    [ Upstream commit 07e10308ee5da8e6132e0b737ece1c99dd651fb6 ]
    
    If a reply has been processed but the RPC is later retransmitted
    anyway, the req->rl_reply field still contains the only pointer to
    the old rpcrdma rep. When the next reply comes in, the reply handler
    will stomp on the rl_reply field, leaking the old rep.
    
    A trace event is added to capture such leaks.
    
    This problem seems to be worsened by the restructuring of the RPC
    Call path in v4.20. Fully addressing this issue will require at
    least a re-architecture of the disconnect logic, which is not
    appropriate during -rc.

    mm/page_alloc.c: free order-0 pages through PCP in page_frag_free()
    
    [ Upstream commit 65895b67ad27df0f62bfaf82dd5622f95ea29196 ]
    
    page_frag_free() calls __free_pages_ok() to free the page back to Buddy.
    This is OK for high order page, but for order-0 pages, it misses the
    optimization opportunity of using Per-Cpu-Pages and can cause zone lock
    contention when called frequently.
    
    Pawel Staszewski recently shared his result of 'how Linux kernel handles
    normal traffic'[1] and from perf data, Jesper Dangaard Brouer found the
    lock contention comes from page allocator:
    
      mlx5e_poll_tx_cq
      |
       --16.34%--napi_consume_skb
                 |
                 |--12.65%--__free_pages_ok
                 |          |
                 |           --11.86%--free_one_page
                 |                     |
                 |                     |--10.10%--queued_spin_lock_slowpath
                 |                     |
                 |                      --0.65%--_raw_spin_lock
                 |
                 |--1.55%--page_frag_free
                 |
                  --1.44%--skb_release_data
    
    Jesper explained how it happened: mlx5 driver RX-page recycle mechanism is
    not effective in this workload and pages have to go through the page
    allocator.  The lock contention happens during mlx5 DMA TX completion
    cycle.  And the page allocator cannot keep up at these speeds.[2]
    
    I thought that __free_pages_ok() are mostly freeing high order pages and
    thought this is an lock contention for high order pages but Jesper
    explained in detail that __free_pages_ok() here are actually freeing
    order-0 pages because mlx5 is using order-0 pages to satisfy its page pool
    allocation request.[3]
    
    The free path as pointed out by Jesper is:
    skb_free_head()
      -> skb_free_frag()
        -> page_frag_free()
    And the pages being freed on this path are order-0 pages.
    
    Fix this by doing similar things as in __page_frag_cache_drain() - send
    the being freed page to PCP if it's an order-0 page, or directly to Buddy
    if it is a high order page.
    
    With this change, Paweł hasn't noticed lock contention yet in his
    workload and Jesper has noticed a 7% performance improvement using a micro
    benchmark and lock contention is gone.  Ilias' test on a 'low' speed 1Gbit
    interface on an cortex-a53 shows ~11% performance boost testing with
    64byte packets and __free_pages_ok() disappeared from perf top.

    vmscan: return NODE_RECLAIM_NOSCAN in node_reclaim() when CONFIG_NUMA is n
    
    [ Upstream commit 8b09549c2bfd9f3f8f4cdad74107ef4f4ff9cdd7 ]
    
    Commit fa5e084e43eb ("vmscan: do not unconditionally treat zones that
    fail zone_reclaim() as full") changed the return value of
    node_reclaim().  The original return value 0 means NODE_RECLAIM_SOME
    after this commit.
    
    While the return value of node_reclaim() when CONFIG_NUMA is n is not
    changed.  This will leads to call zone_watermark_ok() again.
    
    This patch fixes the return value by adjusting to NODE_RECLAIM_NOSCAN.
    Since node_reclaim() is only called in page_alloc.c, move it to
    mm/internal.h.

    ocfs2: clear journal dirty flag after shutdown journal
    
    [ Upstream commit d85400af790dba2aa294f0a77e712f166681f977 ]
    
    Dirty flag of the journal should be cleared at the last stage of umount,
    if do it before jbd2_journal_destroy(), then some metadata in uncommitted
    transaction could be lost due to io error, but as dirty flag of journal
    was already cleared, we can't find that until run a full fsck.  This may
    cause system panic or other corruption.

    [ Upstream commit 0deae39cec6dab3a66794f3e9e83ca4dc30080f1 ]
    
    When the watchdog timer is set in interrupt mode, it causes a

    ease debugging, not to crash the kernel and reboot the machine.

    within the idle task.

    [ Upstream commit 77ea5f4cbe2084db9ab021ba73fb7eadf1610884 ]
    
    The frame_size passed to build_skb must be aligned, else it is
    possible that the embedded struct skb_shared_info gets unaligned.
    
    For correctness make sure that xdpf->headroom in included in the
    alignment. No upstream drivers can hit this, as all XDP drivers provide
    an aligned headroom.  This was discovered when playing with implementing
    XDP support for mvneta, which have a 2 bytes DSA header, and this
    Marvell ARM64 platform didn't like doing atomic operations on an
    unaligned skb_shinfo(skb)->dataref addresses.

    drbd: do not block when adjusting "disk-options" while IO is frozen
    
    [ Upstream commit f708bd08ecbdc23d03aaedf5b3311ebe44cfdb50 ]
    
    "suspending" IO is overloaded.
    It can mean "do not allow new requests" (obviously),
    but it also may mean "must not complete pending IO",
    for example while the fencing handlers do their arbitration.
    
    When adjusting disk options, we suspend io (disallow new requests), then
    wait for the activity-log to become unused (drain all IO completions),
    and possibly replace it with a new activity log of different size.
    
    If the other "suspend IO" aspect is active, pending IO completions won't
    happen, and we would block forever (unkillable drbdsetup process).
    
    Fix this by skipping the activity log adjustment if the "al-extents"
    setting did not change. Also, in case it did change, fail early without
    blocking if it looks like we would block forever.

    drbd: reject attach of unsuitable uuids even if connected
    
    [ Upstream commit fe43ed97bba3b11521abd934b83ed93143470e4f ]
    
    Multiple failure scenario:
    a) all good
       Connected Primary/Secondary UpToDate/UpToDate
    b) lose disk on Primary,
       Connected Primary/Secondary Diskless/UpToDate
    c) continue to write to the device,
       changes only make it to the Secondary storage.
    d) lose disk on Secondary,
       Connected Primary/Secondary Diskless/Diskless
    e) now try to re-attach on Primary
    
    This would have succeeded before, even though that is clearly the
    wrong data set to attach to (missing the modifications from c).
    Because we only compared our "effective" and the "to-be-attached"
    data generation uuid tags if (device->state.conn < C_CONNECTED).
    
    Fix: change that constraint to (device->state.pdsk != D_UP_TO_DATE)
    compare the uuids, and reject the attach.
    
    This patch also tries to improve the reverse scenario:
    first lose Secondary, then Primary disk,
    then try to attach the disk on Secondary.
    
    Before this patch, the attach on the Secondary succeeds, but since commit
    drbd: disconnect, if the wrong UUIDs are attached on a connected peer
    the Primary will notice unsuitable data, and drop the connection hard.
    
    Though unfortunately at a point in time during the handshake where
    we cannot easily abort the attach on the peer without more
    refactoring of the handshake.
    
    We now reject any attach to "unsuitable" uuids,
    as long as we can see a Primary role,
    unless we already have access to "good" data.

    drbd: ignore "all zero" peer volume sizes in handshake
    
    [ Upstream commit 94c43a13b8d6e3e0dd77b3536b5e04a84936b762 ]
    
    During handshake, if we are diskless ourselves, we used to accept any size
    presented by the peer.
    
    Which could be zero if that peer was just brought up and connected
    to us without having a disk attached first, in which case both
    peers would just "flip" their volume sizes.
    
    Now, even a diskless node will ignore "zero" sizes
    presented by a diskless peer.
    
    Also a currently Diskless Primary will refuse to shrink during handshake:
    it may be frozen, and waiting for a "suitable" local disk or peer to
    re-appear (on-no-data-accessible suspend-io). If the peer is smaller
    than what we used to be, it is not suitable.
    
    The logic for a diskless node during handshake is now supposed to be:
    believe the peer, if
     - I don't have a current size myself
     - we agree on the size anyways
     - I do have a current size, am Secondary, and he has the only disk
     - I do have a current size, am Primary, and he has the only disk,
       which is larger than my current size

    The bamboo dts has a bug: it uses a non-naturally aligned range
    for PCI memory space. This isnt' supported by the code, thus
    causing PCI to break on this system.
    
    This is due to the fact that while the chip memory map has 1G
    reserved for PCI memory, it's only 512M aligned. The code doesn't
    know how to split that into 2 different PMMs and fails, so limit
    the region to 512M.

    powerpc/32: Avoid unsupported flags with clang
    
    [ Upstream commit 72e7bcc2cdf82bf03caaa5e6c9b0134c2fc2ee7d ]
    
    When building for ppc32 with clang these flags are unsupported:
    
      -ffixed-r2 and -mmultiple
    
    llvm's lib/Target/PowerPC/PPCRegisterInfo.cpp marks r2 as reserved on
    when building for SVR4ABI and !ppc64:
    
      // The SVR4 ABI reserves r2 and r13
      if (Subtarget.isSVR4ABI()) {
        // We only reserve r2 if we need to use the TOC pointer. If we have no
        // explicit uses of the TOC pointer (meaning we're a leaf function with
        // no constant-pool loads, etc.) and we have no potential uses inside an
        // inline asm block, then we can treat r2 has an ordinary callee-saved
        // register.
        const PPCFunctionInfo *FuncInfo = MF.getInfo<PPCFunctionInfo>();
        if (!TM.isPPC64() || FuncInfo->usesTOCBasePtr() || MF.hasInlineAsm())
          markSuperRegs(Reserved, PPC::R2);  // System-reserved register
        markSuperRegs(Reserved, PPC::R13); // Small Data Area pointer register
      }
    
    This means we can safely omit -ffixed-r2 when building for 32-bit
    targets.
    
    The -mmultiple/-mno-multiple flags are not supported by clang, so
    platforms that might support multiple miss out on using multiple word
    instructions.
    
    We wrap these flags in cc-option so that when Clang gains support the
    kernel will be able use these flags.
    
    Clang 8 can then build a ppc44x_defconfig which boots in Qemu:
    
      make CC=clang-8 ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu-  ppc44x_defconfig
      ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_DEVTMPFS -d DEVTMPFS_MOUNT
      make CC=clang-8 ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu-
    
      qemu-system-ppc -M bamboo \
       -kernel arch/powerpc/boot/zImage \
       -dtb arch/powerpc/boot/dts/bamboo.dtb \
       -initrd ~/ppc32-440-rootfs.cpio \
       -nographic -serial stdio -monitor pty -append "console=ttyS0"

    scsi: qla2xxx: deadlock by configfs_depend_item
    
    [ Upstream commit 17b18eaa6f59044a5172db7d07149e31ede0f920 ]
    
    The intent of invoking configfs_depend_item in commit 7474f52a82d51
    ("tcm_qla2xxx: Perform configfs depend/undepend for base_tpg")
    was to prevent a physical Fibre Channel port removal when
    virtual (NPIV) ports announced through that physical port are active.
    The change does not work as expected: it makes enabled physical port
    dependent on target configfs subsystem (the port's parent), something
    the configfs guarantees anyway.
    
    Besides, scheduling work in a worker thread and waiting for the work's
    completion is not really a valid workaround for the requirement not to call
    configfs_depend_item from a configfs callback: the call occasionally
    deadlocks.
    
    Thus, removing configfs_depend_item calls does not break anything and fixes
    the deadlock problem.

    Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Handle specific unknown packets after firmware loading
    
    [ Upstream commit 22bba80500fdf624a7cfbb65fdfa97a038ae224d ]
    
    The Broadcom controller on aries S5PV210 boards sends out a couple of
    unknown packets after the firmware is loaded.  This will cause
    logging of errors such as:
            Bluetooth: hci0: Frame reassembly failed (-84)
    
    This is probably also the case with other boards, as there are related
    Android userspace patches for custom ROMs such as
    https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/LineageOS/android_system_bt/+/142721/
    Since this appears to be intended behaviour, treated them as diagnostic
    packets.

    If palmas_smps_read() fails, we should not use the read data in "reg"
    which may contain random value. The fix inserts a check for the return
    value of palmas_smps_read(): If it fails, we return the error code
    upstream and stop using "reg".

    vxlan: Fix error path in __vxlan_dev_create()
    
    [ Upstream commit 6db9246871394b3a136cd52001a0763676563840 ]
    
    When a failure occurs in rtnl_configure_link(), the current code
    calls unregister_netdevice() to roll back the earlier call to
    register_netdevice(), and jumps to errout, which calls
    vxlan_fdb_destroy().
    
    However unregister_netdevice() calls transitively ndo_uninit, which is
    vxlan_uninit(), and that already takes care of deleting the default FDB
    entry by calling vxlan_fdb_delete_default(). Since the entry added
    earlier in __vxlan_dev_create() is exactly the default entry, the
    cleanup code in the errout block always leads to double free and thus a
    panic.
    
    Besides, since vxlan_fdb_delete_default() always destroys the FDB entry
    with notification enabled, the deletion of the default entry is notified
    even before the addition was notified.
    
    Instead, move the unregister_netdevice() call after the manual destroy,
    which solves both problems.

    clocksource/drivers/fttmr010: Fix invalid interrupt register access
    
    [ Upstream commit 86fe57fc47b17b3528fa5497fc57e158d846c4ea ]
    
    TIMER_INTR_MASK register (Base Address of Timer + 0x38) is not designed
    for masking interrupts on ast2500 chips, and it's not even listed in
    ast2400 datasheet, so it's not safe to access TIMER_INTR_MASK on aspeed
    chips.
    
    Similarly, TIMER_INTR_STATE register (Base Address of Timer + 0x34) is
    not interrupt status register on ast2400 and ast2500 chips. Although
    there is no side effect to reset the register in fttmr010_common_init(),
    it's just misleading to do so.
    
    Besides, "count_down" is renamed to "is_aspeed" in "fttmr010" structure,
    and more comments are added so the code is more readble.

    xfs: Fix bulkstat compat ioctls on x32 userspace.
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ca860e3c1a74ad6bd8949364073ef1044cad758 ]
    
    The bulkstat family of ioctls are problematic on x32, because there is
    a mixup of native 32-bit and 64-bit conventions.  The xfs_fsop_bulkreq
    struct contains pointers and 32-bit integers so that matches the native
    32-bit layout, and that means the ioctl implementation goes into the
    regular compat path on x32.
    
    However, the 'ubuffer' member of that struct in turn refers to either
    struct xfs_inogrp or xfs_bstat (or an array of these).  On x32, those
    structures match the native 64-bit layout.  The compat implementation
    writes out the 32-bit version of these structures.  This is not the
    expected format for x32 userspace, causing problems.
    
    Fortunately the functions which actually output these xfs_inogrp and
    xfs_bstat structures have an easy way to select which output format
    is required, so we just need a little tweak to select the right format
    on x32.

    xfs: Align compat attrlist_by_handle with native implementation.
    
    [ Upstream commit c456d64449efe37da50832b63d91652a85ea1d20 ]
    
    While inspecting the ioctl implementations, I noticed that the compat
    implementation of XFS_IOC_ATTRLIST_BY_HANDLE does not do exactly the
    same thing as the native implementation.  Specifically, the "cursor"
    does not appear to be written out to userspace on the compat path,
    like it is on the native path.
    
    This adjusts the compat implementation to copy out the cursor just
    like the native implementation does.  The attrlist cursor does not
    require any special compat handling.  This fixes xfstests xfs/269
    on both IA-32 and x32 userspace, when running on an amd64 kernel.

    netfilter: nf_nat_sip: fix RTP/RTCP source port translations
    
    [ Upstream commit 8294059931448aa1ca112615bdffa3eab552c382 ]
    
    Each media stream negotiation between 2 SIP peers will trigger creation
    of 4 different expectations (2 RTP and 2 RTCP):
     - INVITE will create expectations for the media packets sent by the
       called peer
     - reply to the INVITE will create expectations for media packets sent
       by the caller
    
    The dport used by these expectations usually match the ones selected
    by the SIP peers, but they might get translated due to conflicts with
    another expectation. When such event occur, it is important to do
    this translation in both directions, dport translation on the receiving
    path and sport translation on the sending path.
    
    This commit fixes the sport translation when the peer requiring it is
    also the one that starts the media stream. In this scenario, first media
    stream packet is forwarded from LAN to WAN and will rely on
    nf_nat_sip_expected() to do the necessary sport translation. However, the
    expectation matched by this packet does not contain the necessary information
    for doing SNAT, this data being stored in the paired expectation created by
    the sender's SIP message (INVITE or reply to it).

    net/mlx5: Continue driver initialization despite debugfs failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 199fa087dc6b503baad06712716fac645a983e8a ]
    
    The failure to create debugfs entry is unpleasant event, but not enough
    to abort drier initialization. Align the mlx5_core code to debugfs design
    and continue execution whenever debugfs_create_dir() successes or not.

    pinctrl: xway: fix gpio-hog related boot issues
    
    [ Upstream commit 9b4924da4711674e62d97d4f5360446cc78337af ]
    
    This patch is based on commit a86caa9ba5d7 ("pinctrl: msm: fix gpio-hog
    related boot issues").
    
    It fixes the issue that the gpio ranges needs to be defined before
    gpiochip_add().
    
    Therefore, we also have to swap the order of registering the pinctrl
    driver and registering the gpio chip.
    
    You also have to add the "gpio-ranges" property to the pinctrl device
    node to get it finally working.

    serial: 8250: Rate limit serial port rx interrupts during input overruns
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d7f677a2afa1c82d7fc7af7f9159cbffd5dc010 ]
    
    When a serial port gets faulty or gets flooded with inputs, its interrupt
    handler starts to work double time to get the characters to the workqueue
    for the tty layer to handle them. When this busy time on the serial/tty
    subsystem happens during boot, where it is also busy on the userspace
    trying to initialise, some processes can continuously get preempted
    and will be on hold until the interrupts subside.
    
    The fix is to backoff on processing received characters for a specified
    amount of time when an input overrun is seen (received a new character
    before the previous one is processed). This only stops receive and will
    continue to transmit characters to serial port. After the backoff period
    is done, it receive will be re-enabled. This is optional and will only
    be enabled by setting 'overrun-throttle-ms' in the dts.

    btrfs: only track ref_heads in delayed_ref_updates
    
    [ Upstream commit 158ffa364bf723fa1ef128060646d23dc3942994 ]
    
    We use this number to figure out how many delayed refs to run, but
    __btrfs_run_delayed_refs really only checks every time we need a new
    delayed ref head, so we always run at least one ref head completely no
    matter what the number of items on it.  Fix the accounting to only be
    adjusted when we add/remove a ref head.
    
    In addition to using this number to limit the number of delayed refs
    run, a future patch is also going to use it to calculate the amount of
    space required for delayed refs space reservation.

    Btrfs: allow clear_extent_dirty() to receive a cached extent state record
    
    [ Upstream commit 0e6ec385b55f6001da8c6b1532494241e52c550d ]
    
    We can have a lot freed extents during the life span of transaction, so
    the red black tree that keeps track of the ranges of each freed extent
    (fs_info->freed_extents[]) can get quite big. When finishing a
    transaction commit we find each range, process it (discard the extents,
    unpin them) and then remove it from the red black tree.
    
    We can use an extent state record as a cache when searching for a range,
    so that when we clean the range we can use the cached extent state we
    passed to the search function instead of iterating the red black tree
    again. Doing things as fast as possible when finishing a transaction (in
    state TRANS_STATE_UNBLOCKED) is convenient as it reduces the time we
    block another task that wants to commit the next transaction.
    
    So change clear_extent_dirty() to allow an optional extent state record to
    be passed as an argument, which will be passed down to __clear_extent_bit.

    btrfs: Check for missing device before bio submission in btrfs_map_bio
    
    [ Upstream commit fc8a168aa9ab1680c2bd52bf9db7c994e0f2524f ]
    
    Before btrfs_map_bio submits all stripe bios it does a number of checks
    to ensure the device for every stripe is present. However, it doesn't do
    a DEV_STATE_MISSING check, instead this is relegated to the lower level
    btrfs_schedule_bio (in the async submission case, sync submission
    doesn't check DEV_STATE_MISSING at all). Additionally
    btrfs_schedule_bios does the duplicate device->bdev check which has
    already been performed in btrfs_map_bio.
    
    This patch moves the DEV_STATE_MISSING check in btrfs_map_bio and
    removes the duplicate device->bdev check. Doing so ensures that no bio
    cloning/submission happens for both async/sync requests in the face of
    missing device. This makes the async io submission path slightly shorter
    in terms of instruction count. No functional changes.

    usb: ehci-omap: Fix deferred probe for phy handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 8dc7623bf608495b6e6743e805807c7840673573 ]
    
    PHY model is being used on omap5 platforms even if port mode
    is not OMAP_EHCI_PORT_MODE_PHY. So don't guess if PHY is required
    or not based on PHY mode.
    
    If PHY is provided in device tree, it must be required. So, if
    devm_usb_get_phy_by_phandle() gives us an error code other
    than -ENODEV (no PHY) then error out.
    
    This fixes USB Ethernet on omap5-uevm if PHY happens to
    probe after EHCI thus causing a -EPROBE_DEFER.

    mmc: meson-gx: make sure the descriptor is stopped on errors
    
    [ Upstream commit 18f92bc02f1739b5c4d5b70009fbb7eada45bca3 ]
    
    On errors, if we don't stop the descriptor chain, it may continue to
    run and raise IRQ after we have called mmc_request_done(). This is bad
    because we won't be able to get cmd anymore and properly deal with the
    IRQ.
    
    This patch makes sure the descriptor chain is stopped before
    calling mmc_request_done()

    VSOCK: bind to random port for VMADDR_PORT_ANY
    
    [ Upstream commit 8236b08cf50f85bbfaf48910a0b3ee68318b7c4b ]
    
    The old code always starts from fixed port for VMADDR_PORT_ANY. Sometimes
    when VMM crashed, there is still orphaned vsock which is waiting for
    close timer, then it could cause connection time out for new started VM
    if they are trying to connect to same port with same guest cid since the
    new packets could hit that orphaned vsock. We could also fix this by doing
    more in vhost_vsock_reset_orphans, but any way, it should be better to start
    from a random local port instead of a fixed one.

    [ Upstream commit 0916224eaa77bff0fbbc747961d550ff8db45457 ]
    
    When removing the driver, the following flow can happen:
    1. host command is in progress, for example at index 68.
    2. RX interrupt is received with the response.
    3. Before it is processed, the remove flow kicks in, and
       calls iwl_pcie_txq_unmap. The function cleans all DMA,
       and promotes the read pointer to 69.
    4. RX thread proceeds with the processing, and is calling
       iwl_pcie_cmdq_reclaim, which will print this error:
       iwl_pcie_cmdq_reclaim: Read index for DMA queue txq id (0),
       index 4 is out of range [0-256] 69 69.

    warning while at it, to make such issues more noticeable
    in the future.

    iwlwifi: mvm: force TCM re-evaluation on TCM resume
    
    [ Upstream commit 7bc2468277033e05401d5f8fd48a772f407338c2 ]
    
    When traffic load is not low or low latency is active, TCM schedules
    re-evaluation work so in case traffic stops TCM will detect that
    traffic load has become low or that low latency is no longer active.
    However, if TCM is paused when the re-evaluation work runs, it does
    not re-evaluate and the re-evaluation work is no longer scheduled.
    As a result, TCM will not indicate that low latency is no longer
    active or that traffic load is low when traffic stops.
    
    Fix this by forcing TCM re-evaluation when TCM is resumed in case
    low latency is active or traffic load is not low.

    This function is only half-used by mvm (i.e. only the nvm_version part
    matters, since the calibration version is irrelevant), so it's
    pointless to export it from iwlwifi.  If mvm uses this function, it
    has the additional complexity of setting the calib version to a bogus
    value on all cfg structs.
    
    To avoid this, move the function to dvm and make a simple comparison
    of the nvm_version in mvm instead.

    microblaze: fix multiple bugs in arch/microblaze/boot/Makefile
    
    [ Upstream commit 4722a3e6b716d9d4594c3cf3856b03bbd24a59a8 ]
    
    This commit fixes some build issues.
    
    The first issue is the breakage of linux.bin.ub target since commit
    ece97f3a5fb5 ("microblaze: Fix simpleImage format generation")
    because the addition of UIMAGE_{IN,OUT} affected it.
    
    make ARCH=microblaze CROSS_COMPILE=microblaze-linux- linux.bin.ub
      [ snip ]
      OBJCOPY arch/microblaze/boot/linux.bin
      UIMAGE  arch/microblaze/boot/linux.bin.ub.ub
    /usr/bin/mkimage: Can't open arch/microblaze/boot/linux.bin.ub: No such file or directory
    make[1]: *** [arch/microblaze/boot/Makefile;14: arch/microblaze/boot/linux.bin.ub] Error 1
    make: *** [arch/microblaze/Makefile;83: linux.bin.ub] Error 2
    
    The second issue is the use of the "if_changed" multiple times for
    the same target.
    
    As commit 92a4728608a8 ("x86/boot: Fix if_changed build flip/flop bug")
    pointed out, this never works properly. Moreover, generating multiple
    images as a side-effect is confusing.
    
    Let's split the build recipe for each image.
    
    simpleImage.<dt>*.unstrip is just a copy of vmlinux.
    
    simpleImage.<dt> and simpleImage.<dt>.ub are created in the same way
    as linux.bin and linux.bin.ub, respectively.
    
    I kept simpleImage.* recipes independent of linux.bin.* ones to not
    change the behavior.
    
    Lastly, this commit fixes "make ARCH=microblaze clean". Previously,
    it only cleaned up the unstrip image. Now, all the simpleImage files
    are cleaned.

    microblaze: adjust the help to the real behavior
    
    [ Upstream commit bafcc61d998c1ca18f556d92a0e95335ac68c7da ]
    
    "make ARCH=microblaze help" mentions simpleImage.<dt>.unstrip,
    but it is not a real Make target. It does not work because Makefile
    assumes "system.unstrip" is the name of DT.
    
    $ make ARCH=microblaze CROSS_COMPILE=microblaze-linux- simpleImage.system.unstrip
      [ snip ]
    make[1]: *** No rule to make target 'arch/microblaze/boot/dts/system.unstrip.dtb', needed by 'arch/microblaze/boot/dts/system.dtb'.  Stop.
    make: *** [Makefile;1060: arch/microblaze/boot/dts] Error 2
    make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
    
    simpleImage.<dt> works like a phony target that generates multiple
    images. Reflect the real behavior. I removed the DT directory path
    information because it is already explained a few lines below.
    
    While I am here, I deleted the redundant *_defconfig explanation.
    
    The top-level Makefile caters to list available defconfig files:
    
      mmu_defconfig            - Build for mmu
      nommu_defconfig          - Build for nommu

    bcache: do not mark writeback_running too early
    
    [ Upstream commit 79b791466e525c98f6aeee9acf5726e7b27f4231 ]
    
    A fresh backing device is not attached to any cache_set, and
    has no writeback kthread created until first attached to some
    cache_set.
    
    But bch_cached_dev_writeback_init run
    "
            dc->writeback_running           = true;
            WARN_ON(test_and_clear_bit(BCACHE_DEV_WB_RUNNING,
                            &dc->disk.flags));
    "
    for any newly formatted backing devices.
    
    For a fresh standalone backing device, we can get something like
    following even if no writeback kthread created:
    ------------------------
    /sys/block/bcache0/bcache# cat writeback_running
    1
    /sys/block/bcache0/bcache# cat writeback_rate_debug
    rate:           512.0k/sec
    dirty:          0.0k
    target:         0.0k
    proportional:   0.0k
    integral:       0.0k
    change:         0.0k/sec
    next io:        -15427384ms
    
    The none ZERO fields are misleading as no alive writeback kthread yet.
    
    Set dc->writeback_running false as no writeback thread created in
    bch_cached_dev_writeback_init().
    
    We have writeback thread created and woken up in bch_cached_dev_writeback
    _start(). Set dc->writeback_running true before bch_writeback_queue()
    called, as a writeback thread will check if dc->writeback_running is true
    before writing back dirty data, and hung if false detected.
    
    After the change, we can get the following output for a fresh standalone
    backing device:
    -----------------------
    /sys/block/bcache0/bcache$ cat writeback_running
    0
    /sys/block/bcache0/bcache# cat writeback_rate_debug
    rate:           0.0k/sec
    dirty:          0.0k
    target:         0.0k
    proportional:   0.0k
    integral:       0.0k
    change:         0.0k/sec
    next io:        0ms
    
    v1 -> v2:
      Set dc->writeback_running before bch_writeback_queue() called,

    crypto: user - support incremental algorithm dumps
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ac6b8fb23c724b015d9ca70a89126e8d1563166 ]
    
    CRYPTO_MSG_GETALG in NLM_F_DUMP mode sometimes doesn't return all
    registered crypto algorithms, because it doesn't support incremental
    dumps.  crypto_dump_report() only permits itself to be called once, yet
    the netlink subsystem allocates at most ~64 KiB for the skb being dumped
    to.  Thus only the first recvmsg() returns data, and it may only include
    a subset of the crypto algorithms even if the user buffer passed to
    recvmsg() is large enough to hold all of them.
    
    Fix this by using one of the arguments in the netlink_callback structure
    to keep track of the current position in the algorithm list.  Then
    userspace can do multiple recvmsg() on the socket after sending the dump
    request.  This is the way netlink dumps work elsewhere in the kernel;
    it's unclear why this was different (probably just an oversight).
    
    Also fix an integer overflow when calculating the dump buffer size hint.

    s390/zcrypt: make sysfs reset attribute trigger queue reset
    
    [ Upstream commit 42a87d4103ae365e18c3be1333592ab583b8ad9d ]
    
    Until now there is no way to reset a AP queue or card. Driving a card
    or queue offline and online again does only toggle the 'software'
    online state. The only way to trigger a (hardware) reset is by running
    hot-unplug/hot-plug for example on the HMC.
    
    This patch makes the queue reset attribute in sysfs writable.
    Writing into this attribute triggers a reset on the AP queue's state
    machine. So the AP queue is flushed and state machine runs through the
    initial states which cause a reset (PQAP(RAPQ)) and a re-registration
    to interrupts (PQAP(AQIC)) if available.
    
    The reset sysfs attribute is writable by root only. So only an
    administrator is allowed to initiate a reset of AP queues. Please note
    that the queue's counter values are left untouched by the reset.

    nvme: provide fallback for discard alloc failure
    
    [ Upstream commit cb5b7262b011cfb793519bf97e54dff5282da23c ]
    
    When boxes are run near (or to) OOM, we have a problem with the discard
    page allocation in nvme. If we fail allocating the special page, we
    return busy, and it'll get retried. But since ordering is honored for
    dispatch requests, we can keep retrying this same IO and failing. Behind
    that IO could be requests that want to free memory, but they never get
    the chance.
    
    Allocate a fixed discard page per controller for a safe fallback, and use
    that if the initial allocation fails.

    ACPI / LPSS: Ignore acpi_device_fix_up_power() return value
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a2fa02f7489dc4d746f2a15fb77b3ce1affade8 ]
    
    Ignore acpi_device_fix_up_power() return value. If we return an error
    we end up with acpi_default_enumeration() still creating a platform-
    device for the device and we end up with the device still being used
    but without the special LPSS related handling which is not useful.
    
    Specicifically ignoring the error fixes the touchscreen no longer
    working after a suspend/resume on a Prowise PT301 tablet.
    
    This tablet has a broken _PS0 method on the touchscreen's I2C controller,
    causing acpi_device_fix_up_power() to fail, causing fallback to standard
    platform-dev handling and specifically causing acpi_lpss_save/restore_ctx
    to not run.
    
    The I2C controllers _PS0 method does actually turn on the device, but then
    does some more nonsense which fails when run during early boot trying to
    use I2C opregion handling on another not-yet registered I2C controller.

    xfs: zero length symlinks are not valid
    
    [ Upstream commit 43feeea88c9cb2955b9f7ba8152ec5abeea42810 ]
    
    A log recovery failure has been reproduced where a symlink inode has
    a zero length in extent form. It was caused by a shutdown during a
    combined fstress+fsmark workload.
    
    The underlying problem is the issue in xfs_inactive_symlink(): the
    inode is unlocked between the symlink inactivation/truncation and
    the inode being freed. This opens a window for the inode to be
    written to disk before it xfs_ifree() removes it from the unlinked
    list, marks it free in the inobt and zeros the mode.
    
    For shortform inodes, the fix is simple. xfs_ifree() clears the data
    fork state, so there's no need to do it in xfs_inactive_symlink().
    This means the shortform fork verifier will not see a zero length
    data fork as it mirrors the inode size through to xfs_ifree()), and
    hence if the inode gets written back and the fork verifiers are run
    they will still see a fork that matches the on-disk inode size.
    
    For extent form (remote) symlinks, it is a little more tricky. Here
    we explicitly set the inode size to zero, so the above race can lead
    to zero length symlinks on disk. Because the inode is unlinked at
    this point (i.e. on the unlinked list) and unreferenced, it can
    never be seen again by a user. Hence when we set the inode size to
    zeor, also change the type to S_IFREG. xfs_ifree() expects S_IFREG
    inodes to be of zero length, and so this avoids all the problems of
    zero length symlinks ever hitting the disk. It also avoids the
    problem of needing to handle zero length symlink inodes in log
    recovery to replay the extent free intents and the remaining
    deferops to free the extents the symlink used.
    
    Also add a couple of asserts to warn us if zero length symlinks end
    up in either the symlink create or inactivation paths.

    arm64: preempt: Fix big-endian when checking preempt count in assembly
    
    [ Upstream commit 7faa313f05cad184e8b17750f0cbe5216ac6debb ]
    
    Commit 396244692232 ("arm64: preempt: Provide our own implementation of
    asm/preempt.h") extended the preempt count field in struct thread_info
    to 64 bits, so that it consists of a 32-bit count plus a 32-bit flag
    indicating whether or not the current task needs rescheduling.
    
    Whilst the asm-offsets definition of TSK_TI_PREEMPT was updated to point
    to this new field, the assembly usage was left untouched meaning that a
    32-bit load from TSK_TI_PREEMPT on a big-endian machine actually returns
    the reschedule flag instead of the count.
    
    Whilst we could fix this by pointing TSK_TI_PREEMPT at the count field,
    we're actually better off reworking the two assembly users so that they
    operate on the whole 64-bit value in favour of inspecting the thread
    flags separately in order to determine whether a reschedule is needed.

    bus: ti-sysc: Check for no-reset and no-idle flags at the child level
    
    [ Upstream commit 4014c08ba39476a18af546186da625a6833a1529 ]
    
    With ti-sysc, we need to now have the device tree properties for
    ti,no-reset-on-init and ti,no-idle-on-init at the module level instead
    of the child device level.
    
    Let's check for these properties at the child device level to enable
    quirks, and warn about moving the properties to the module level.
    
    Otherwise am335x-evm based boards tagging gpio1 with ti,no-reset-on-init
    will have their DDR power disabled if wired up in such a tricky way.
    
    Note that this should not be an issue for earlier kernels as we don't
    rely on this until the dts files have been updated to probe with ti-sysc
    interconnect target driver.

    The __cpu_up() routine ignores the errors reported by the firmware
    for a CPU bringup operation and looks for the error status set by the
    booting CPU. If the CPU never entered the kernel, we could end up
    in assuming stale error status, which otherwise would have been
    set/cleared appropriately by the booting CPU.

    arm64: mm: Prevent mismatched 52-bit VA support
    
    [ Upstream commit a96a33b1ca57dbea4285893dedf290aeb8eb090b ]
    
    For cases where there is a mismatch in ARMv8.2-LVA support between CPUs
    we have to be careful in allowing secondary CPUs to boot if 52-bit
    virtual addresses have already been enabled on the boot CPU.
    
    This patch adds code to the secondary startup path. If the boot CPU has
    enabled 52-bit VAs then ID_AA64MMFR2_EL1 is checked to see if the
    secondary can also enable 52-bit support. If not, the secondary is
    prevented from booting and an error message is displayed indicating why.
    
    Technically this patch could be implemented using the cpufeature code
    when considering 52-bit userspace support. However, we employ low level
    checks here as the cpufeature code won't be able to run if we have
    mismatched 52-bit kernel va support.

    [ Upstream commit 013d37e4707e24c7b9bc3fc55aeda55ce9c2b262 ]
    
    Boards based on imx31 have duplicate memory nodes:
    
    - One coming from the board dts file: memory@
    
    - One coming from the imx31.dtsi file.
    
    Fix the duplication by removing the memory node from the dtsi file
    and by adding 'device_type = "memory";' in the board dts.

    tracing: Lock event_mutex before synth_event_mutex
    
    [ Upstream commit fc800a10be26017f8f338bc8e500d48e3e6429d9 ]
    
    synthetic event is using synth_event_mutex for protecting
    synth_event_list, and event_trigger_write() path acquires
    locks as below order.
    
    event_trigger_write(event_mutex)
      ->trigger_process_regex(trigger_cmd_mutex)
        ->event_hist_trigger_func(synth_event_mutex)
    
    On the other hand, synthetic event creation and deletion paths
    call trace_add_event_call() and trace_remove_event_call()
    which acquires event_mutex. In that case, if we keep the
    synth_event_mutex locked while registering/unregistering synthetic
    events, its dependency will be inversed.
    
    To avoid this issue, current synthetic event is using a 2 phase
    process to create/delete events. For example, it searches existing
    events under synth_event_mutex to check for event-name conflicts, and
    unlocks synth_event_mutex, then registers a new event under event_mutex
    locked. Finally, it locks synth_event_mutex and tries to add the
    new event to the list. But it can introduce complexity and a chance
    for name conflicts.
    
    To solve this simpler, this introduces trace_add_event_call_nolock()
    and trace_remove_event_call_nolock() which don't acquire
    event_mutex inside. synthetic event can lock event_mutex before
    synth_event_mutex to solve the lock dependency issue simpler.

    net: bcmgenet: reapply manual settings to the PHY
    
    [ Upstream commit 0686bd9d5e6863f60e4bb1e78e6fe7bb217a0890 ]
    
    The phy_init_hw() function may reset the PHY to a configuration
    that does not match manual network settings stored in the phydev
    structure. If the phy state machine is polled rather than event
    driven this can create a timing hazard where the phy state machine
    might alter the settings stored in the phydev structure from the
    value read from the BMCR.
    
    This commit follows invocations of phy_init_hw() by the bcmgenet
    driver with invocations of the genphy_config_aneg() function to
    ensure that the BMCR is written to match the settings held in the
    phydev structure. This prevents the risk of manual settings being
    accidentally altered.

    net: bcmgenet: use RGMII loopback for MAC reset
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a55402c93877d291b0a612d25edb03d1b4b93ac ]
    
    As noted in commit 28c2d1a7a0bf ("net: bcmgenet: enable loopback
    during UniMAC sw_reset") the UniMAC must be clocked while sw_reset
    is asserted for its state machines to reset cleanly.
    
    The transmit and receive clocks used by the UniMAC are derived from
    the signals used on its PHY interface. The bcmgenet MAC can be
    configured to work with different PHY interfaces including MII,
    GMII, RGMII, and Reverse MII on internal and external interfaces.
    Unfortunately for the UniMAC, when configured for MII the Tx clock
    is always driven from the PHY which places it outside of the direct
    control of the MAC.
    
    The earlier commit enabled a local loopback mode within the UniMAC
    so that the receive clock would be derived from the transmit clock
    which addressed the observed issue with an external GPHY disabling
    it's Rx clock. However, when a Tx clock is not available this
    loopback is insufficient.
    
    This commit implements a workaround that leverages the fact that
    the MAC can reliably generate all of its necessary clocking by
    enterring the external GPHY RGMII interface mode with the UniMAC in
    local loopback during the sw_reset interval. Unfortunately, this
    has the undesirable side efect of the RGMII GTXCLK signal being
    driven during the same window.
    
    In most configurations this is a benign side effect as the signal
    is either not routed to a pin or is already expected to drive the
    pin. The one exception is when an external MII PHY is expected to
    drive the same pin with its TX_CLK output creating output driver
    contention.
    
    This commit exploits the IEEE 802.3 clause 22 standard defined
    isolate mode to force an external MII PHY to present a high
    impedance on its TX_CLK output during the window to prevent any
    contention at the pin.
    
    The MII interface is used internally with the 40nm internal EPHY
    which agressively disables its clocks for power savings leading to
    incomplete resets of the UniMAC and many instabilities observed
    over the years. The workaround of this commit is expected to put
    an end to those problems.

    scripts/gdb: fix debugging modules compiled with hot/cold partitioning
    
    [ Upstream commit 8731acc5068eb3f422a45c760d32198175c756f8 ]
    
    gcc's -freorder-blocks-and-partition option makes it group frequently
    and infrequently used code in .text.hot and .text.unlikely sections
    respectively.  At least when building modules on s390, this option is
    used by default.
    
    gdb assumes that all code is located in .text section, and that .text
    section is located at module load address.  With such modules this is no
    longer the case: there is code in .text.hot and .text.unlikely, and
    either of them might precede .text.
    
    Fix by explicitly telling gdb the addresses of code sections.
    
    It might be tempting to do this for all sections, not only the ones in
    the white list.  Unfortunately, gdb appears to have an issue, when
    telling it about e.g. loadable .note.gnu.build-id section causes it to
    think that non-loadable .note.Linux section is loaded at address 0,
    which in turn causes NULL pointers to be resolved to bogus symbols.  So
    keep using the white list approach for the time being.

    Do not support mmap in S/PDIF mode. In S/PDIF mode
    the buffer has to be copied, to allow the channel status

    watchdog: meson: Fix the wrong value of left time
    
    [ Upstream commit 2c77734642d52448aca673e889b39f981110828b ]
    
    The left time value is wrong when we get it by sysfs. The left time value
    should be equal to preset timeout value minus elapsed time value. According
    to the Meson-GXB/GXL datasheets which can be found at [0], the timeout value
    is saved to BIT[0-15] of the WATCHDOG_TCNT, and elapsed time value is saved
    to BIT[16-31] of the WATCHDOG_TCNT.

    [ Upstream commit 1f7f504dcd9d1262437bdcf4fa071e41dec1af03 ]
    
    In case of a resource shortage, i.e. the rx_offload queue will overflow
    or a skb fails to be allocated (due to OOM),
    can_rx_offload_offload_one() will call mailbox_read() to discard the
    mailbox and return an ERR_PTR.
    
    If the hardware FIFO is empty can_rx_offload_offload_one() will return
    NULL.
    
    In case a CAN frame was read from the hardware,
    can_rx_offload_offload_one() returns the skb containing it.
    
    Without this patch can_rx_offload_irq_offload_fifo() bails out if no skb
    returned, regardless of the reason.
    
    Similar to can_rx_offload_irq_offload_timestamp() in case of a resource
    shortage the whole FIFO should be discarded, to avoid an IRQ storm and
    give the system some time to recover. However if the FIFO is empty the
    loop can be left.
    
    With this patch the loop is left in case of empty FIFO, but not on
    errors.

    Since can_rx_offload_irq_offload_timestamp() is typically called from a

    [ Upstream commit d763ab3044f0bf50bd0e6179f6b2cf1c125d1d94 ]
    
    Before this patch can_rx_offload_offload_one() returns a pointer to a
    skb containing the read CAN frame or a NULL pointer.
    
    However the meaning of the NULL pointer is ambiguous, it can either mean
    the requested mailbox is empty or there was an error.
    
    This patch fixes this situation by returning:
    - pointer to skb on success
    - NULL pointer if mailbox is empty
    - ERR_PTR() in case of an error
    
    All users of can_rx_offload_offload_one() have been adopted, no

    The skb_queue is a linked list, holding the skb to be processed in the

    Without this patch, the queue length in can_rx_offload_offload_one() is

    x86/resctrl: Prevent NULL pointer dereference when reading mondata
    
    [ Upstream commit 26467b0f8407cbd628fa5b7bcfd156e772004155 ]
    
    When a mon group is being deleted, rdtgrp->flags is set to RDT_DELETED
    in rdtgroup_rmdir_mon() firstly. The structure of rdtgrp will be freed
    until rdtgrp->waitcount is dropped to 0 in rdtgroup_kn_unlock() later.
    
    During the window of deleting a mon group, if an application calls
    rdtgroup_mondata_show() to read mondata under this mon group,
    'rdtgrp' returned from rdtgroup_kn_lock_live() is a NULL pointer when
    rdtgrp->flags is RDT_DELETED. And then 'rdtgrp' is passed in this path:
    rdtgroup_mondata_show() --> mon_event_read() --> mon_event_count().
    Thus it results in NULL pointer dereference in mon_event_count().
    
    Check 'rdtgrp' in rdtgroup_mondata_show(), and return -ENOENT
    immediately when reading mondata during the window of deleting a mon
    group.

    If there is an entry at INT_MAX then idr_for_each_entry() will increment

    unsigned addition which (when assigned to id) will result in INT_MIN.

    return NULL, ending the loop as expected.

    powerpc/bpf: Fix tail call implementation
    
    [ Upstream commit 7de086909365cd60a5619a45af3f4152516fd75c ]
    
    We have seen many crashes on powerpc hosts while loading bpf programs.
    
    The problem here is that bpf_int_jit_compile() does a first pass
    to compute the program length.
    
    Then it allocates memory to store the generated program and
    calls bpf_jit_build_body() a second time (and a third time
    later)
    
    What I have observed is that the second bpf_jit_build_body()
    could end up using few more words than expected.
    
    If bpf_jit_binary_alloc() put the space for the program
    at the end of the allocated page, we then write on
    a non mapped memory.
    
    It appears that bpf_jit_emit_tail_call() calls
    bpf_jit_emit_common_epilogue() while ctx->seen might not
    be stable.
    
    Only after the second pass we can be sure ctx->seen wont be changed.
    
    Trying to avoid a second pass seems quite complex and probably
    not worth it.

    Without enabling keep-power-in-suspend, we can't wake the device
    up using WOL packet, and the log is flooded with these messages
    on resume:

    sunxi-mmc 1c10000.mmc: data error, sending stop command
    
    So to make the WiFi really a wakeup-source, we need to keep it powered
    during suspend.

    The MMA8451 interrupt triggers as low level, so the GPIO6_IO31 pin
    needs to activate its pull up, otherwise it will stay always at low level
    generating multiple interrupts.
    
    The current device tree does not configure the IOMUX for this pin, so
    it uses whathever comes configured from the bootloader.
    
    The IOMUXC_SW_PAD_CTL_PAD_EIM_BCLK register value comes as 0x8000 from
    the bootloader, which has PKE bit cleared, hence disabling the
    pull-up.
    
    Instead of relying on a previous configuration from the bootloader,
    configure the GPIO6_IO31 pin with pull-up enabled in order to fix
    this problem.

    pinctrl: cherryview: Allocate IRQ chip dynamic
    
    [ Upstream commit 67d33aecd030226f0a577eb683aaa6853ecf8f91 ]
    
    Keeping the IRQ chip definition static shares it with multiple instances
    of the GPIO chip in the system. This is bad and now we get this warning
    from GPIO library:
    
    "detected irqchip that is shared with multiple gpiochips: please fix the driver."
    
    Hence, move the IRQ chip definition from being driver static into the struct
    intel_pinctrl. So a unique IRQ chip is used for each GPIO chip instance.
    
    This patch is heavily based on the attachment to the bug by Christoph Marz.

    ASoC: kirkwood: fix device remove ordering
    
    [ Upstream commit dc39596a906d5b604f4e64597b6e904fc14625e8 ]
    
    The devm conversion of kirkwood was incorrect; on removal, devm takes
    effect after the "remove" function has returned.  So, the effect of
    the conversion was to change the order during remove from:
    
      - snd_soc_unregister_component() (unpublishes interfaces)
      - clk_disable_unprepare()
      - cleanup resources
    
    After the conversion, this became:
    
      - clk_disable_unprepare() - while the device may still be active
      - snd_soc_unregister_component()
      - cleanup resources
    
    Hence, it introduces a bug, where the internal clock for the device
    may be shut down before the device itself has been shut down.  It is
    known that Marvell SoCs, including Dove, locks up if registers for a
    peripheral that has its clocks disabled are accessed.

    reset: Fix memory leak in reset_control_array_put()
    
    [ Upstream commit 532f9cd6ee994ed10403e856ca27501428048597 ]
    
    Memory allocated for 'struct reset_control_array' in
    of_reset_control_array_get() is never freed in
    reset_control_array_put() resulting in kmemleak showing
    the following backtrace.

    ASoC: msm8916-wcd-analog: Fix RX1 selection in RDAC2 MUX
    
    [ Upstream commit 9110d1b0e229cebb1ffce0c04db2b22beffd513d ]
    
    According to the PM8916 Hardware Register Description,
    CDC_D_CDC_CONN_HPHR_DAC_CTL has only a single bit (RX_SEL)
    to switch between RX1 (0) and RX2 (1). It is not possible to
    disable it entirely to achieve the "ZERO" state.
    
    However, at the moment the "RDAC2 MUX" mixer defines three possible
    values ("ZERO", "RX2" and "RX1"). Setting the mixer to "ZERO"
    actually configures it to RX1. Setting the mixer to "RX1" has
    (seemingly) no effect.
    
    Remove "ZERO" and replace it with "RX1" to fix this.

    clocksource/drivers/mediatek: Fix error handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 41d49e7939de5ec532d86494185b2ca2e99c848a ]
    
    When timer_of_init fails, it cleans up after itself by undoing
    everything it did during the initialization function.
    
    mtk_syst_init and mtk_gpt_init both call timer_of_cleanup if
    timer_of_init fails. timer_of_cleanup try to release the resource
    taken.  Since these resources have already been cleaned up by
    timer_of_init, we end up getting a few warnings printed:

    clk: meson: gxbb: let sar_adc_clk_div set the parent clock rate
    
    [ Upstream commit 44b09b11b813b8550e6b976ea51593bc23bba8d1 ]
    
    The meson-saradc driver manually sets the input clock for
    sar_adc_clk_sel. Update the GXBB clock driver (which is used on GXBB,
    GXL and GXM) so the rate settings on sar_adc_clk_div are propagated up
    to sar_adc_clk_sel which will let the common clock framework select the
    best matching parent clock if we want that.
    
    This makes sar_adc_clk_div consistent with the axg-aoclk and g12a-aoclk
    drivers, which both also specify CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT.
