    perf/x86/intel: Fix PEBS data source interpretation on Nehalem/Westmere
    
    commit e17dc65328057c00db7e1bfea249c8771a78b30b upstream.
    
    Jiri reported some time ago that some entries in the PEBS data source table
    in perf do not agree with the SDM. We investigated and the bits
    changed for Sandy Bridge, but the SDM was not updated.
    
    perf already implements the bits correctly for Sandy Bridge
    and later. This patch patches it up for Nehalem and Westmere.

    perf/x86/intel: Use PAGE_SIZE for PEBS buffer size on Core2
    
    commit e72daf3f4d764c47fb71c9bdc7f9c54a503825b1 upstream.
    
    Using PAGE_SIZE buffers makes the WRMSR to PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL in
    intel_pmu_enable_all() mysteriously hang on Core2. As a workaround, we
    don't do this.
    
    The hard lockup is easily triggered by running 'perf test attr'
    repeatedly. Most of the time it gets stuck on sample session with
    small periods.
    
      # perf test attr -vv
      14: struct perf_event_attr setup                             :

    perf/x86/intel: Fix PEBS warning by only restoring active PMU in pmi
    
    commit c3d266c8a9838cc141b69548bc3b1b18808ae8c4 upstream.
    
    This patch tries to fix a PEBS warning found in my stress test. The
    following perf command can easily trigger the pebs warning or spurious
    NMI error on Skylake/Broadwell/Haswell platforms:
    
      sudo perf record -e 'cpu/umask=0x04,event=0xc4/pp,cycles,branches,ref-cycles,cache-misses,cache-references' --call-graph fp -b -c1000 -a
    
    Also the NMI watchdog must be enabled.
    
    For this case, the events number is larger than counter number. So
    perf has to do multiplexing.
    
    In perf_mux_hrtimer_handler, it does perf_pmu_disable(), schedule out
    old events, rotate_ctx, schedule in new events and finally
    perf_pmu_enable().
    
    If the old events include precise event, the MSR_IA32_PEBS_ENABLE
    should be cleared when perf_pmu_disable().  The MSR_IA32_PEBS_ENABLE
    should keep 0 until the perf_pmu_enable() is called and the new event is
    precise event.
    
    However, there is a corner case which could restore PEBS_ENABLE to
    stale value during the above period. In perf_pmu_disable(), GLOBAL_CTRL
    will be set to 0 to stop overflow and followed PMI. But there may be
    pending PMI from an earlier overflow, which cannot be stopped. So even
    GLOBAL_CTRL is cleared, the kernel still be possible to get PMI. At
    the end of the PMI handler, __intel_pmu_enable_all() will be called,
    which will restore the stale values if old events haven't scheduled
    out.
    
    Once the stale pebs value is set, it's impossible to be corrected if
    the new events are non-precise. Because the pebs_enabled will be set
    to 0. x86_pmu.enable_all() will ignore the MSR_IA32_PEBS_ENABLE
    setting. As a result, the following NMI with stale PEBS_ENABLE
    trigger pebs warning.
    
    The pending PMI after enabled=0 will become harmless if the NMI handler
    does not change the state. This patch checks cpuc->enabled in pmi and
    only restore the state when PMU is active.

    perf/x86/pebs: Add workaround for broken OVFL status on HSW+
    
    commit 8077eca079a212f26419c57226f28696b7100683 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an issue with the GLOBAL_OVERFLOW_STATUS bits on
    Haswell, Broadwell and Skylake processors when using PEBS.
    
    The SDM stipulates that when the PEBS iterrupt threshold is crossed,
    an interrupt is posted and the kernel is interrupted. The kernel will
    find GLOBAL_OVF_SATUS bit 62 set indicating there are PEBS records to
    drain. But the bits corresponding to the actual counters should NOT be
    set. The kernel follows the SDM and assumes that all PEBS events are
    processed in the drain_pebs() callback. The kernel then checks for
    remaining overflows on any other (non-PEBS) events and processes these
    in the for_each_bit_set(&status) loop.
    
    As it turns out, under certain conditions on HSW and later processors,
    on PEBS buffer interrupt, bit 62 is set but the counter bits may be
    set as well. In that case, the kernel drains PEBS and generates
    SAMPLES with the EXACT tag, then it processes the counter bits, and
    generates normal (non-EXACT) SAMPLES.
    
    I ran into this problem by trying to understand why on HSW sampling on
    a PEBS event was sometimes returning SAMPLES without the EXACT tag.
    This should not happen on user level code because HSW has the
    eventing_ip which always point to the instruction that caused the
    event.
    
    The workaround in this patch simply ensures that the bits for the
    counters used for PEBS events are cleared after the PEBS buffer has
    been drained. With this fix 100% of the PEBS samples on my user code
    report the EXACT tag.
    
    Before:
      $ perf record -e cpu/event=0xd0,umask=0x81/upp ./multichase
      $ perf report -D | fgrep SAMPLES
      PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE(IP, 0x2): 11775/11775: 0x406de5 period: 73469 addr: 0 exact=Y
                               \--- EXACT tag is missing
    
    After:
      $ perf record -e cpu/event=0xd0,umask=0x81/upp ./multichase
      $ perf report -D | fgrep SAMPLES
      PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE(IP, 0x4002): 11775/11775: 0x406de5 period: 73469 addr: 0 exact=Y
                               \--- EXACT tag is set
    
    The problem tends to appear more often when multiple PEBS events are used.

    sched/cputime: Fix steal time accounting vs. CPU hotplug
    
    commit e9532e69b8d1d1284e8ecf8d2586de34aec61244 upstream.
    
    On CPU hotplug the steal time accounting can keep a stale rq->prev_steal_time
    value over CPU down and up. So after the CPU comes up again the delta
    calculation in steal_account_process_tick() wreckages itself due to the
    unsigned math:
    
             u64 steal = paravirt_steal_clock(smp_processor_id());
    
             steal -= this_rq()->prev_steal_time;
    
    So if steal is smaller than rq->prev_steal_time we end up with an insane large
    value which then gets added to rq->prev_steal_time, resulting in a permanent
    wreckage of the accounting. As a consequence the per CPU stats in /proc/stat
    become stale.
    
    Nice trick to tell the world how idle the system is (100%) while the CPU is
    100% busy running tasks. Though we prefer realistic numbers.
    
    None of the accounting values which use a previous value to account for
    fractions is reset at CPU hotplug time. update_rq_clock_task() has a sanity
    check for prev_irq_time and prev_steal_time_rq, but that sanity check solely
    deals with clock warps and limits the /proc/stat visible wreckage. The
    prev_time values are still wrong.
    
    Solution is simple: Reset rq->prev_*_time when the CPU is plugged in again.

    commit 276142730c39c9839465a36a90e5674a8c34e839 upstream.
    
    When suspending to RAM, waking up and later suspending to disk,

    This does not occur if we always suspend to RAM or always to disk.
    
    pm_complete_with_resume_check(), which gets called from
    pci_pm_complete() among others, schedules a runtime resume
    if PM_SUSPEND_FLAG_FW_RESUME is set. The flag is set during
    a suspend-to-RAM cycle. It is cleared at the beginning of
    the suspend-to-RAM cycle but not afterwards and it is not
    cleared during a suspend-to-disk cycle at all. Fix it.

    intel_idle: prevent SKL-H boot failure when C8+C9+C10 enabled
    
    commit d70e28f57e14a481977436695b0c9ba165472431 upstream.
    
    Some SKL-H configurations require "intel_idle.max_cstate=7" to boot.
    While that is an effective workaround, it disables C10.
    
    This patch detects the problematic configuration,
    and disables C8 and C9, keeping C10 enabled.
    
    Note that enabling SGX in BIOS SETUP can also prevent this issue,
    if the system BIOS provides that option.

    mm/page_alloc: prevent merging between isolated and other pageblocks
    
    commit d9dddbf556674bf125ecd925b24e43a5cf2a568a upstream.
    
    Hanjun Guo has reported that a CMA stress test causes broken accounting of
    CMA and free pages:
    
    > Before the test, I got:
    > -bash-4.3# cat /proc/meminfo | grep Cma
    > CmaTotal:         204800 kB
    > CmaFree:          195044 kB
    >
    >
    > After running the test:
    > -bash-4.3# cat /proc/meminfo | grep Cma
    > CmaTotal:         204800 kB
    > CmaFree:         6602584 kB
    >
    > So the freed CMA memory is more than total..
    >
    > Also the the MemFree is more than mem total:
    >
    > -bash-4.3# cat /proc/meminfo
    > MemTotal:       16342016 kB
    > MemFree:        22367268 kB
    > MemAvailable:   22370528 kB
    
    Laura Abbott has confirmed the issue and suspected the freepage accounting
    rewrite around 3.18/4.0 by Joonsoo Kim.  Joonsoo had a theory that this is
    caused by unexpected merging between MIGRATE_ISOLATE and MIGRATE_CMA
    pageblocks:
    
    > CMA isolates MAX_ORDER aligned blocks, but, during the process,
    > partialy isolated block exists. If MAX_ORDER is 11 and
    > pageblock_order is 9, two pageblocks make up MAX_ORDER
    > aligned block and I can think following scenario because pageblock
    > (un)isolation would be done one by one.
    >
    > (each character means one pageblock. 'C', 'I' means MIGRATE_CMA,
    > MIGRATE_ISOLATE, respectively.
    >
    > CC -> IC -> II (Isolation)
    > II -> CI -> CC (Un-isolation)
    >
    > If some pages are freed at this intermediate state such as IC or CI,
    > that page could be merged to the other page that is resident on
    > different type of pageblock and it will cause wrong freepage count.
    
    This was supposed to be prevented by CMA operating on MAX_ORDER blocks,
    but since it doesn't hold the zone->lock between pageblocks, a race
    window does exist.
    
    It's also likely that unexpected merging can occur between
    MIGRATE_ISOLATE and non-CMA pageblocks.  This should be prevented in
    __free_one_page() since commit 3c605096d315 ("mm/page_alloc: restrict
    max order of merging on isolated pageblock").  However, we only check
    the migratetype of the pageblock where buddy merging has been initiated,
    not the migratetype of the buddy pageblock (or group of pageblocks)
    which can be MIGRATE_ISOLATE.
    
    Joonsoo has suggested checking for buddy migratetype as part of
    page_is_buddy(), but that would add extra checks in allocator hotpath
    and bloat-o-meter has shown significant code bloat (the function is
    inline).
    
    This patch reduces the bloat at some expense of more complicated code.
    The buddy-merging while-loop in __free_one_page() is initially bounded
    to pageblock_border and without any migratetype checks.  The checks are
    placed outside, bumping the max_order if merging is allowed, and
    returning to the while-loop with a statement which can't be possibly
    considered harmful.
    
    This fixes the accounting bug and also removes the arguably weird state
    in the original commit 3c605096d315 where buddies could be left
    unmerged.

    ocfs2/dlm: fix BUG in dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list
    
    commit be12b299a83fc807bbaccd2bcb8ec50cbb0cb55c upstream.
    
    When master handles convert request, it queues ast first and then
    returns status.  This may happen that the ast is sent before the request
    status because the above two messages are sent by two threads.  And
    right after the ast is sent, if master down, it may trigger BUG in
    dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list in the requested node because ast
    handler moves it to grant list without clear lock->convert_pending.  So
    remove BUG_ON statement and check if the ast is processed in
    dlmconvert_remote.

    ocfs2/dlm: fix race between convert and recovery
    
    commit ac7cf246dfdbec3d8fed296c7bf30e16f5099dac upstream.
    
    There is a race window between dlmconvert_remote and
    dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list, which will cause a lock with
    OCFS2_LOCK_BUSY in grant list, thus system hangs.
    
    dlmconvert_remote
    {
            spin_lock(&res->spinlock);
            list_move_tail(&lock->list, &res->converting);
            lock->convert_pending = 1;
            spin_unlock(&res->spinlock);
    
            status = dlm_send_remote_convert_request();
            >>>>>> race window, master has queued ast and return DLM_NORMAL,
                   and then down before sending ast.
                   this node detects master down and calls
                   dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list, which will revert the
                   lock to grant list.
                   Then OCFS2_LOCK_BUSY won't be cleared as new master won't
                   send ast any more because it thinks already be authorized.
    
            spin_lock(&res->spinlock);
            lock->convert_pending = 0;
            if (status != DLM_NORMAL)
                    dlm_revert_pending_convert(res, lock);
            spin_unlock(&res->spinlock);
    }
    
    In this case, check if res->state has DLM_LOCK_RES_RECOVERING bit set
    (res is still in recovering) or res master changed (new master has
    finished recovery), reset the status to DLM_RECOVERING, then it will
    retry convert.

    writeback, cgroup: fix use of the wrong bdi_writeback which mismatches the inode
    
    commit aaf2559332ba272671bb870464a99b909b29a3a1 upstream.
    
    When cgroup writeback is in use, there can be multiple wb's
    (bdi_writeback's) per bdi and an inode may switch among them
    dynamically.  In a couple places, the wrong wb was used leading to
    performing operations on the wrong list under the wrong lock
    corrupting the io lists.
    
    * writeback_single_inode() was taking @wb parameter and used it to
      remove the inode from io lists if it becomes clean after writeback.
      The callers of this function were always passing in the root wb
      regardless of the actual wb that the inode was associated with,
      which could also change while writeback is in progress.
    
      Fix it by dropping the @wb parameter and using
      inode_to_wb_and_lock_list() to determine and lock the associated wb.
    
    * After writeback_sb_inodes() writes out an inode, it re-locks @wb and
      inode to remove it from or move it to the right io list.  It assumes
      that the inode is still associated with @wb; however, the inode may
      have switched to another wb while writeback was in progress.
    
      Fix it by using inode_to_wb_and_lock_list() to determine and lock
      the associated wb after writeback is complete.  As the function
      requires the original @wb->list_lock locked for the next iteration,
      in the unlikely case where the inode has changed association, switch
      the locks.
    
    Kudos to Tahsin for pinpointing these subtle breakages.

    writeback, cgroup: fix premature wb_put() in locked_inode_to_wb_and_lock_list()
    
    commit 614a4e3773148a31f58dc174bbf578ceb63510c2 upstream.
    
    locked_inode_to_wb_and_lock_list() wb_get()'s the wb associated with
    the target inode, unlocks inode, locks the wb's list_lock and verifies
    that the inode is still associated with the wb.  To prevent the wb
    going away between dropping inode lock and acquiring list_lock, the wb
    is pinned while inode lock is held.  The wb reference is put right
    after acquiring list_lock citing that the wb won't be dereferenced
    anymore.
    
    This isn't true.  If the inode is still associated with the wb, the
    inode has reference and it's safe to return the wb; however, if inode
    has been switched, the wb still needs to be unlocked which is a
    dereference and can lead to use-after-free if it it races with wb
    destruction.
    
    Fix it by putting the reference after releasing list_lock.

    ACPI / PM: Runtime resume devices when waking from hibernate
    
    commit fbda4b38fa3995aa0777fe9cbbdcb223c6292083 upstream.
    
    Commit 58a1fbbb2ee8 ("PM / PCI / ACPI: Kick devices that might have been
    reset by firmware") added a runtime resume for devices that were runtime
    suspended when the system entered suspend-to-RAM.
    
    Briefly, the motivation was to ensure that devices did not remain in a
    reset-power-on state after resume, potentially preventing deep SoC-wide
    low-power states from being entered on idle.
    
    Currently we're not doing the same when leaving suspend-to-disk and this
    asymmetry is a problem if drivers rely on the automatic resume triggered
    by pm_complete_with_resume_check(). Fix it.

    commit 4aed9c46afb80164401143aa0fdcfe3798baa9d5 upstream.
    
    A number of spots in the xdr decoding follow a pattern like
    
            n = be32_to_cpup(p++);
            READ_BUF(n + 4);
    
    where n is a u32.  The only bounds checking is done in READ_BUF itself,
    but since it's checking (n + 4), it won't catch cases where n is very
    large, (u32)(-4) or higher.  I'm not sure exactly what the consequences
    are, but we've seen crashes soon after.
    
    Instead, just break these up into two READ_BUF()s.

    iser-target: Rework connection termination
    
    commit 6d1fba0c2cc7efe42fd761ecbba833ed0ea7b07e upstream.
    
    When we receive an event that triggers connection termination,
    we have a a couple of things we may want to do:
    1. In case we are already terminating, bailout early
    2. In case we are connected but not bound, disconnect and schedule
       a connection cleanup silently (don't reinstate)
    3. In case we are connected and bound, disconnect and reinstate the connection
    
    This rework fixes a bug that was detected against a mis-behaved
    initiator which rejected our rdma_cm accept, in this stage the
    isert_conn is no bound and reinstate caused a bogus dereference.
    
    What's great about this is that we don't need the
    post_recv_buf_count anymore, so get rid of it.

    target: Fix target_release_cmd_kref shutdown comp leak
    
    commit 5e47f1985d7107331c3f64fb3ec83d66fd73577e upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an active I/O shutdown bug for fabric
    drivers using target_wait_for_sess_cmds(), where se_cmd
    descriptor shutdown would result in hung tasks waiting
    indefinitely for se_cmd->cmd_wait_comp to complete().
    
    To address this bug, drop the incorrect list_del_init()
    usage in target_wait_for_sess_cmds() and always complete()
    during se_cmd target_release_cmd_kref() put, in order to
    let caller invoke the final fabric release callback
    into se_cmd->se_tfo->release_cmd() code.

    commit 773b3966dd3cdaeb68e7f2edfe5656abac1dc411 upstream.
    
    Our dividers weren't being set successfully because CM_PASSWORD wasn't
    included in the register write.  It looks easier to just compute the
    divider to write ourselves than to update clk-divider for the ability
    to OR in some arbitrary bits on write.

    mmc: sdhci: Fix override of timeout clk wrt max_busy_timeout
    
    commit 995136247915c5cee633d55ba23f6eebf67aa567 upstream.
    
    Normally the timeout clock frequency is read from the capabilities
    register.  It is also possible to set the value prior to calling
    sdhci_add_host() in which case that value will override the
    capabilities register value.  However that was being done after
    calculating max_busy_timeout so that max_busy_timeout was being
    calculated using the wrong value of timeout_clk.
    
    Fix that by moving the override before max_busy_timeout is
    calculated.
    
    The result is that the max_busy_timeout and max_discard
    increase for BSW devices so that, for example, the time for
    mkfs.ext4 on a 64GB eMMC drops from about 1 minute 40 seconds
    to about 20 seconds.
    
    Note, in the future, the capabilities setting will be tidied up
    and this override won't be used anymore.  However this fix is
    needed for stable.

    mmc: sdhci: fix data timeout (part 2)
    
    commit 7f05538af71c7d30b5fc821cbe9f318edc645961 upstream.
    
    The calculation for the timeout based on the number of card clocks is
    incorrect.  The calculation assumed:
    
            timeout in microseconds = clock cycles / clock in Hz
    
    which is clearly a several orders of magnitude wrong.  Fix this by
    multiplying the clock cycles by 1000000 prior to dividing by the Hz
    based clock.  Also, as per part 1, ensure that the division rounds
    up.
    
    As this needs 64-bit math via do_div(), avoid it if the clock cycles
    is zero.

    The data timeout gives the minimum amount of time that should be
    waited before timing out if no data is received from the card.
    Simply dividing the nanosecond part by 1000 does not give this
    required guarantee, since such a division rounds down.  Use
    DIV_ROUND_UP() to give the desired timeout.

    kbuild/mkspec: fix grub2 installkernel issue
    
    commit c8b08ca558c0067bc9e15ce3f1e70af260410bb2 upstream.
    
    mkspec is copying built kernel to temporrary location
    
            /boot/vmlinuz-$KERNELRELEASE-rpm
    
    and runs installkernel on it. This however directly leads to grub2
    menuentry for this suffixed binary being generated as well during the run
    of installkernel script.
    
    Later in the process the temporary -rpm suffixed files are removed, and
    therefore we end up with spurious (and non-functional) grub2 menu entries
    for each installed kernel RPM.
    
    Fix that by using a different temporary name (prefixed by '.'), so that
    the binary is not recognized as an actual kernel binary and no menuentry
    is created for it.

    bitops: Do not default to __clear_bit() for __clear_bit_unlock()
    
    commit f75d48644c56a31731d17fa693c8175328957e1d upstream.
    
    __clear_bit_unlock() is a special little snowflake. While it carries the
    non-atomic '__' prefix, it is specifically documented to pair with
    test_and_set_bit() and therefore should be 'somewhat' atomic.
    
    Therefore the generic implementation of __clear_bit_unlock() cannot use
    the fully non-atomic __clear_bit() as a default.
    
    If an arch is able to do better; is must provide an implementation of
    __clear_bit_unlock() itself.
    
    Specifically, this came up as a result of hackbench livelock'ing in
    slab_lock() on ARC with SMP + SLUB + !LLSC.
    
    The issue was incorrect pairing of atomic ops.
    
     slab_lock() -> bit_spin_lock() -> test_and_set_bit()
     slab_unlock() -> __bit_spin_unlock() -> __clear_bit()
    
    The non serializing __clear_bit() was getting "lost"
    
     80543b8e:      ld_s       r2,[r13,0] <--- (A) Finds PG_locked is set
     80543b90:      or         r3,r2,1    <--- (B) other core unlocks right here
     80543b94:      st_s       r3,[r13,0] <--- (C) sets PG_locked (overwrites unlock)
    
    Fixes ARC STAR 9000817404 (and probably more).

    tracing: Fix trace_printk() to print when not using bprintk()
    
    commit 3debb0a9ddb16526de8b456491b7db60114f7b5e upstream.
    
    The trace_printk() code will allocate extra buffers if the compile detects
    that a trace_printk() is used. To do this, the format of the trace_printk()
    is saved to the __trace_printk_fmt section, and if that section is bigger
    than zero, the buffers are allocated (along with a message that this has
    happened).
    
    If trace_printk() uses a format that is not a constant, and thus something
    not guaranteed to be around when the print happens, the compiler optimizes
    the fmt out, as it is not used, and the __trace_printk_fmt section is not
    filled. This means the kernel will not allocate the special buffers needed
    for the trace_printk() and the trace_printk() will not write anything to the
    tracing buffer.
    
    Adding a "__used" to the variable in the __trace_printk_fmt section will
    keep it around, even though it is set to NULL. This will keep the string
    from being printed in the debugfs/tracing/printk_formats section as it is
    not needed.

    tracing: Fix crash from reading trace_pipe with sendfile
    
    commit a29054d9478d0435ab01b7544da4f674ab13f533 upstream.
    
    If tracing contains data and the trace_pipe file is read with sendfile(),
    then it can trigger a NULL pointer dereference and various BUG_ON within the
    VM code.
    
    There's a patch to fix this in the splice_to_pipe() code, but it's also a
    good idea to not let that happen from trace_pipe either.

    tracing: Have preempt(irqs)off trace preempt disabled functions
    
    commit cb86e05390debcc084cfdb0a71ed4c5dbbec517d upstream.
    
    Joel Fernandes reported that the function tracing of preempt disabled
    sections was not being reported when running either the preemptirqsoff or
    preemptoff tracers. This was due to the fact that the function tracer
    callback for those tracers checked if irqs were disabled before tracing. But
    this fails when we want to trace preempt off locations as well.
    
    Joel explained that he wanted to see funcitons where interrupts are enabled
    but preemption was disabled. The expected output he wanted:
    
       <...>-2265    1d.h1 3419us : preempt_count_sub <-irq_exit
       <...>-2265    1d..1 3419us : __do_softirq <-irq_exit
       <...>-2265    1d..1 3419us : msecs_to_jiffies <-__do_softirq
       <...>-2265    1d..1 3420us : irqtime_account_irq <-__do_softirq
       <...>-2265    1d..1 3420us : __local_bh_disable_ip <-__do_softirq
       <...>-2265    1..s1 3421us : run_timer_softirq <-__do_softirq
       <...>-2265    1..s1 3421us : hrtimer_run_pending <-run_timer_softirq
       <...>-2265    1..s1 3421us : _raw_spin_lock_irq <-run_timer_softirq
       <...>-2265    1d.s1 3422us : preempt_count_add <-_raw_spin_lock_irq
       <...>-2265    1d.s2 3422us : _raw_spin_unlock_irq <-run_timer_softirq
       <...>-2265    1..s2 3422us : preempt_count_sub <-_raw_spin_unlock_irq
       <...>-2265    1..s1 3423us : rcu_bh_qs <-__do_softirq
       <...>-2265    1d.s1 3423us : irqtime_account_irq <-__do_softirq
       <...>-2265    1d.s1 3423us : __local_bh_enable <-__do_softirq
    
    There's a comment saying that the irq disabled check is because there's a
    possible race that tracing_cpu may be set when the function is executed. But
    I don't remember that race. For now, I added a check for preemption being
    enabled too to not record the function, as there would be no race if that
    was the case. I need to re-investigate this, as I'm now thinking that the
    tracing_cpu will always be correct. But no harm in keeping the check for
    now, except for the slight performance hit.

    IB/ipoib: fix for rare multicast join race condition
    
    commit 08bc327629cbd63bb2f66677e4b33b643695097c upstream.
    
    A narrow window for race condition still exist between
    multicast join thread and *dev_flush workers.
    A kernel crash caused by prolong erratic link state changes
    was observed (most likely a faulty cabling):

    Changes from v4:
    - as suggested by Doug Ledford, optimized spinlock usage,
    i.e. ipoib_mcast_join() is called with lock held.
    Changes from v3:
    - sync with priv->lock before flag check.
    Chages from v2:
    - Move check for OPER_UP flag state to mcast_join() to
    ensure no event worker is in progress.
    - minor style fixes.
    Changes from v1:
    - No need to lock again if error detected.

    drm/radeon: Don't drop DP 2.7 Ghz link setup on some cards.
    
    commit 459ee1c3fd097ab56ababd8ff4bb7ef6a792de33 upstream.
    
    As observed on Apple iMac10,1, DCE-3.2, RV-730,
    link rate of 2.7 Ghz is not selected, because
    the args.v1.ucConfig flag setting for 2.7 Ghz
    gets overwritten by a following assignment of
    the transmitter to use.
    
    Move link rate setup a few lines down to fix this.
    In practice this didn't have any positive or
    negative effect on display setup on the tested
    iMac10,1 so i don't know if backporting to stable
    makes sense or not.

    fs/coredump: prevent fsuid=0 dumps into user-controlled directories
    
    commit 378c6520e7d29280f400ef2ceaf155c86f05a71a upstream.
    
    This commit fixes the following security hole affecting systems where
    all of the following conditions are fulfilled:
    
     - The fs.suid_dumpable sysctl is set to 2.
     - The kernel.core_pattern sysctl's value starts with "/". (Systems
       where kernel.core_pattern starts with "|/" are not affected.)
     - Unprivileged user namespace creation is permitted. (This is
       true on Linux >=3.8, but some distributions disallow it by
       default using a distro patch.)
    
    Under these conditions, if a program executes under secure exec rules,
    causing it to run with the SUID_DUMP_ROOT flag, then unshares its user
    namespace, changes its root directory and crashes, the coredump will be
    written using fsuid=0 and a path derived from kernel.core_pattern - but
    this path is interpreted relative to the root directory of the process,
    allowing the attacker to control where a coredump will be written with
    root privileges.
    
    To fix the security issue, always interpret core_pattern for dumps that
    are written under SUID_DUMP_ROOT relative to the root directory of init.

    fuse: Add reference counting for fuse_io_priv
    
    commit 744742d692e37ad5c20630e57d526c8f2e2fe3c9 upstream.
    
    The 'reqs' member of fuse_io_priv serves two purposes. First is to track
    the number of oustanding async requests to the server and to signal that
    the io request is completed. The second is to be a reference count on the
    structure to know when it can be freed.
    
    For sync io requests these purposes can be at odds.  fuse_direct_IO() wants
    to block until the request is done, and since the signal is sent when
    'reqs' reaches 0 it cannot keep a reference to the object. Yet it needs to
    use the object after the userspace server has completed processing
    requests. This leads to some handshaking and special casing that it
    needlessly complicated and responsible for at least one race condition.
    
    It's much cleaner and safer to maintain a separate reference count for the
    object lifecycle and to let 'reqs' just be a count of outstanding requests
    to the userspace server. Then we can know for sure when it is safe to free
    the object without any handshaking or special cases.
    
    The catch here is that most of the time these objects are stack allocated
    and should not be freed. Initializing these objects with a single reference
    that is never released prevents accidental attempts to free the objects.

    fuse: do not use iocb after it may have been freed
    
    commit 7cabc61e01a0a8b663bd2b4c982aa53048218734 upstream.
    
    There's a race in fuse_direct_IO(), whereby is_sync_kiocb() is called on an
    iocb that could have been freed if async io has already completed.  The fix
    in this case is simple and obvious: cache the result before starting io.

    md: multipath: don't hardcopy bio in .make_request path
    
    commit fafcde3ac1a418688a734365203a12483b83907a upstream.
    
    Inside multipath_make_request(), multipath maps the incoming
    bio into low level device's bio, but it is totally wrong to
    copy the bio into mapped bio via '*mapped_bio = *bio'. For
    example, .__bi_remaining is kept in the copy, especially if
    the incoming bio is chained to via bio splitting, so .bi_end_io
    can't be called for the mapped bio at all in the completing path
    in this kind of situation.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by using clone style.

    md/raid5: preserve STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE in break_stripe_batch_list
    
    commit 550da24f8d62fe81f3c13e3ec27602d6e44d43dc upstream.
    
    break_stripe_batch_list breaks up a batch and copies some flags from
    the batch head to the members, preserving others.
    
    It doesn't preserve or copy STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE.  This is not
    normally a problem as STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE is cleared when a
    stripe_head is added to a batch, and is not set on stripe_heads
    already in a batch.
    
    However there is no locking to ensure one thread doesn't set the flag
    after it has just been cleared in another.  This does occasionally happen.
    
    md/raid5 maintains a count of the number of stripe_heads with
    STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE set: conf->preread_active_stripes.  When
    break_stripe_batch_list clears STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE inadvertently
    this could becomes incorrect and will never again return to zero.
    
    md/raid5 delays the handling of some stripe_heads until
    preread_active_stripes becomes zero.  So when the above mention race
    happens, those stripe_heads become blocked and never progress,
    resulting is write to the array handing.
    
    So: change break_stripe_batch_list to preserve STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE
    in the members of a batch.

    commit 6ab2a4b806ae21b6c3e47c5ff1285ec06d505325 upstream.
    
    Revert commit
    e9e4c377e2f563(md/raid5: per hash value and exclusive wait_for_stripe)
    
    The problem is raid5_get_active_stripe waits on
    conf->wait_for_stripe[hash]. Assume hash is 0. My test release stripes
    in this order:
    - release all stripes with hash 0
    - raid5_get_active_stripe still sleeps since active_stripes >
      max_nr_stripes * 3 / 4
    - release all stripes with hash other than 0. active_stripes becomes 0
    - raid5_get_active_stripe still sleeps, since nobody wakes up
      wait_for_stripe[0]
    The system live locks. The problem is active_stripes isn't a per-hash
    count. Revert the patch makes the live lock go away.

    raid1: include bio_end_io_list in nr_queued to prevent freeze_array hang
    
    commit ccfc7bf1f09d6190ef86693ddc761d5fe3fa47cb upstream.
    
    If raid1d is handling a mix of read and write errors, handle_read_error's
    call to freeze_array can get stuck.
    
    This can happen because, though the bio_end_io_list is initially drained,
    writes can be added to it via handle_write_finished as the retry_list
    is processed. These writes contribute to nr_pending but are not included
    in nr_queued.
    
    If a later entry on the retry_list triggers a call to handle_read_error,
    freeze array hangs waiting for nr_pending == nr_queued+extra. The writes
    on the bio_end_io_list aren't included in nr_queued so the condition will
    never be satisfied.
    
    To prevent the hang, include bio_end_io_list writes in nr_queued.
    
    There's probably a better way to handle decrementing nr_queued, but this
    seemed like the safest way to avoid breaking surrounding code.
    
    I'm happy to supply the script I used to repro this hang.

    ARC: [BE] readl()/writel() to work in Big Endian CPU configuration
    
    commit f778cc65717687a3d3f26dd21bef62cd059f1b8b upstream.
    
    read{l,w}() write{l,w}() primitives should use le{16,32}_to_cpu() and
    cpu_to_le{16,32}() respectively to ensure device registers are read
    correctly in Big Endian CPU configuration.
    
    Per Arnd Bergmann
    | Most drivers using readl() or readl_relaxed() expect those to perform byte
    | swaps on big-endian architectures, as the registers tend to be fixed endian
    
    This was needed for getting UART to work correctly on a Big Endian ARC.
    
    The ARC accessors originally were fine, and the bug got introduced

    splice: handle zero nr_pages in splice_to_pipe()
    
    commit d6785d9152147596f60234157da2b02540c3e60f upstream.
    
    Running the following command:
    
     busybox cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe > /dev/null
    
    with any tracing enabled pretty very quickly leads to various NULL
    pointer dereferences and VM BUG_ON()s, such as these:
    
     BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020
     IP: [<ffffffff8119df6c>] generic_pipe_buf_release+0xc/0x40

    (busybox's cat uses sendfile(2), unlike the coreutils version)
    
    This is because tracing_splice_read_pipe() can call splice_to_pipe()
    with spd->nr_pages == 0.  spd_pages underflows in splice_to_pipe() and
    we fill the page pointers and the other fields of the pipe_buffers with
    garbage.
    
    All other callers of splice_to_pipe() avoid calling it when nr_pages ==
    0, and we could make tracing_splice_read_pipe() do that too, but it
    seems reasonable to have splice_to_page() handle this condition
    gracefully.

    __memblock_alloc_base, when limits are not specified. But
    __memblock_alloc_base takes end value of 0 as MEMBLOCK_ALLOC_ACCESSIBLE
    and limits the end to memblock.current_limit. This results in regions
    never being placed in HIGHMEM area, for e.g. CMA.
    Let __memblock_alloc_base allocate from anywhere in memory if limits are
    not specified.

    cgroup: ignore css_sets associated with dead cgroups during migration
    
    commit 2b021cbf3cb6208f0d40fd2f1869f237934340ed upstream.
    
    Before 2e91fa7f6d45 ("cgroup: keep zombies associated with their
    original cgroups"), all dead tasks were associated with init_css_set.
    If a zombie task is requested for migration, while migration prep
    operations would still be performed on init_css_set, the actual
    migration would ignore zombie tasks.  As init_css_set is always valid,
    this worked fine.
    
    However, after 2e91fa7f6d45, zombie tasks stay with the css_set it was
    associated with at the time of death.  Let's say a task T associated
    with cgroup A on hierarchy H-1 and cgroup B on hiearchy H-2.  After T
    becomes a zombie, it would still remain associated with A and B.  If A
    only contains zombie tasks, it can be removed.  On removal, A gets
    marked offline but stays pinned until all zombies are drained.  At
    this point, if migration is initiated on T to a cgroup C on hierarchy
    H-2, migration path would try to prepare T's css_set for migration and
    trigger the following.

    It doesn't make sense to prepare migration for css_sets pointing to
    dead cgroups as they are guaranteed to contain only zombies which are
    ignored later during migration.  This patch makes cgroup destruction
    path mark all affected css_sets as dead and updates the migration path
    to ignore them during preparation.

    Bluetooth: Fix potential buffer overflow with Add Advertising
    
    commit 6a0e78072c2ae7b20b14e0249d8108441ea928d2 upstream.
    
    The Add Advertising command handler does the appropriate checks for
    the AD and Scan Response data, however fails to take into account the
    general length of the mgmt command itself, which could lead to
    potential buffer overflows. This patch adds the necessary check that
    the mgmt command length is consistent with the given ad and scan_rsp
    lengths.

    mm: memcontrol: reclaim and OOM kill when shrinking memory.max below usage
    
    commit b6e6edcfa40561e9c8abe5eecf1c96f8e5fd9c6f upstream.
    
    Setting the original memory.limit_in_bytes hardlimit is subject to a
    race condition when the desired value is below the current usage.  The
    code tries a few times to first reclaim and then see if the usage has
    dropped to where we would like it to be, but there is no locking, and
    the workload is free to continue making new charges up to the old limit.
    Thus, attempting to shrink a workload relies on pure luck and hope that
    the workload happens to cooperate.
    
    To fix this in the cgroup2 memory.max knob, do it the other way round:
    set the limit first, then try enforcement.  And if reclaim is not able
    to succeed, trigger OOM kills in the group.  Keep going until the new
    limit is met, we run out of OOM victims and there's only unreclaimable
    memory left, or the task writing to memory.max is killed.  This allows
    users to shrink groups reliably, and the behavior is consistent with
    what happens when new charges are attempted in excess of memory.max.

    mm: memcontrol: reclaim when shrinking memory.high below usage
    
    commit 588083bb37a3cea8533c392370a554417c8f29cb upstream.
    
    When setting memory.high below usage, nothing happens until the next
    charge comes along, and then it will only reclaim its own charge and not
    the now potentially huge excess of the new memory.high.  This can cause
    groups to stay in excess of their memory.high indefinitely.
    
    To fix that, when shrinking memory.high, kick off a reclaim cycle that
    goes after the delta.

    When bch_cache_set_alloc() fails to kzalloc the cache_set, the
    asyncronous closure handling tries to dereference a cache_set that
    hadn't yet been allocated inside of cache_set_flush() which is called

    jbd2: fix FS corruption possibility in jbd2_journal_destroy() on umount path
    
    commit c0a2ad9b50dd80eeccd73d9ff962234590d5ec93 upstream.
    
    On umount path, jbd2_journal_destroy() writes latest transaction ID
    (->j_tail_sequence) to be used at next mount.
    
    The bug is that ->j_tail_sequence is not holding latest transaction ID
    in some cases. So, at next mount, there is chance to conflict with
    remaining (not overwritten yet) transactions.
    
            mount (id=10)
            write transaction (id=11)
            write transaction (id=12)
            umount (id=10) <= the bug doesn't write latest ID
    
            mount (id=10)
            write transaction (id=11)
            crash
    
            mount
            [recovery process]
                    transaction (id=11)
                    transaction (id=12) <= valid transaction ID, but old commit
                                           must not replay
    
    Like above, this bug become the cause of recovery failure, or FS
    corruption.
    
    So why ->j_tail_sequence doesn't point latest ID?
    
    Because if checkpoint transactions was reclaimed by memory pressure
    (i.e. bdev_try_to_free_page()), then ->j_tail_sequence is not updated.
    (And another case is, __jbd2_journal_clean_checkpoint_list() is called
    with empty transaction.)
    
    So in above cases, ->j_tail_sequence is not pointing latest
    transaction ID at umount path. Plus, REQ_FLUSH for checkpoint is not
    done too.
    
    So, to fix this problem with minimum changes, this patch updates
    ->j_tail_sequence, and issue REQ_FLUSH.  (With more complex changes,
    some optimizations would be possible to avoid unnecessary REQ_FLUSH
    for example though.)
    
    BTW,
    
            journal->j_tail_sequence =
                    ++journal->j_transaction_sequence;
    
    Increment of ->j_transaction_sequence seems to be unnecessary, but
    ext3 does this.

    ALSA: hda - Fix unconditional GPIO toggle via automute
    
    commit 1f7c6658962fa1260c1658d681bd6bb0c746b99a upstream.
    
    Cirrus HD-audio driver may adjust GPIO pins for EAPD dynamically
    depending on the jack plug state.  This works fine for the auto-mute
    mode where the speaker gets muted upon the HP jack plug.   OTOH, when
    the auto-mute mode is off, this turns off the EAPD unexpectedly
    depending on the jack state, which results in the silent speaker
    output.
    
    This patch fixes the silent speaker output issue by setting GPIO bits
    constantly when the auto-mute mode is off.

    ALSA: hda - Don't handle ELD notify from invalid port
    
    commit 4f8e4f3537cafc4de128e6bfdf83baa78bc60eb1 upstream.
    
    The current Intel HDMI codec driver supports only three fixed ports
    from port B to port D.  However, i915 driver may assign a DP on other
    ports, e.g. port A, when no eDP is used.  This incompatibility is
    caught later at pin_nid_to_pin_index() and results in a warning
    message like "HDMI: pin nid 4 not registered" at each time.
    
    This patch filters out such invalid events beforehand, so that the
    kernel won't be too grumbling.

    bttv: Width must be a multiple of 16 when capturing planar formats
    
    commit 5c915c68763889f0183a1cc61c84bb228b60124a upstream.
    
    On my bttv card "Hauppauge WinTV [card=10]" capturing in YV12 fmt at max
    size results in a solid green rectangle being captured (all colors 0 in
    YUV).
    
    This turns out to be caused by max-width (924) not being a multiple of 16.
    
    We've likely never hit this problem before since normally xawtv / tvtime,
    etc. will prefer packed pixel formats. But when using a video card which
    is using xf86-video-modesetting + glamor, only planar XVideo fmts are
    available, and xawtv will chose a matching capture format to avoid needing
    to do conversion, triggering the solid green window problem.

    Some UART HW has a single register combining UART_DLL/UART_DLM
    (this was probably forgotten in the change that introduced the
    callbacks, commit b32b19b8ffc05cbd3bf91c65e205f6a912ca15d9)

    net: irda: Fix use-after-free in irtty_open()
    
    commit 401879c57f01cbf2da204ad2e8db910525c6dbea upstream.
    
    The N_IRDA line discipline may access the previous line discipline's closed
    and already-fre private data on open [1].
    
    The tty->disc_data field _never_ refers to valid data on entry to the
    line discipline's open() method. Rather, the ldisc is expected to
    initialize that field for its own use for the lifetime of the instance
    (ie. from open() to close() only).

    commit 9ce119f318ba ("tty: Fix GPF in flush_to_ldisc()") fixed a
    GPF caused by a line discipline which does not define a receive_buf()
    method.
    
    However, the vt driver (and speakup driver also) pushes selection
    data directly to the line discipline receive_buf() method via
    tty_ldisc_receive_buf(). Fix the same problem in tty_ldisc_receive_buf().

    commit 4392bf333388cabdad5afe5b1500002d7b9c318e upstream.
    
    hid_ignore_special_drivers works fine until hid_scan_report autodetects and
    reassign devices (for hid-multitouch, hid-microsoft and hid-rmi).
    
    Simplify the handling of the parameter: if it is there, use hid-generic, no

    table.

    X.509: Fix leap year handling again
    
    commit ac4cbedfdf55455b4c447f17f0fa027dbf02b2a6 upstream.
    
    There are still a couple of minor issues in the X.509 leap year handling:
    
     (1) To avoid doing a modulus-by-400 in addition to a modulus-by-100 when
         determining whether the year is a leap year or not, I divided the year
         by 100 after doing the modulus-by-100, thereby letting the compiler do
         one instruction for both, and then did a modulus-by-4.
    
         Unfortunately, I then passed the now-modified year value to mktime64()
         to construct a time value.
    
         Since this isn't a fast path and since mktime64() does a bunch of
         divisions, just condense down to "% 400".  It's also easier to read.
    
     (2) The default month length for any February where the year doesn't
         divide by four exactly is obtained from the month_length[] array where
         the value is 29, not 28.
    
         This is fixed by altering the table.

    crypto: atmel - fix checks of error code returned by devm_ioremap_resource()
    
    commit 9b52d55f4f0e2bb9a34abbcf99e05e17f1b3b281 upstream.
    
    The change fixes potential oops while accessing iomem on invalid
    address, if devm_ioremap_resource() fails due to some reason.
    
    The devm_ioremap_resource() function returns ERR_PTR() and never
    returns NULL, which makes useless a following check for NULL.

    We're clearing the wrong memory.  The memory corruption is likely
    harmless because we weren't going to use that stack memory again but not
    zeroing is a potential information leak.

    crypto: ccp - memset request context to zero during import
    
    commit ce0ae266feaf35930394bd770c69778e4ef03ba9 upstream.
    
    Since a crypto_ahash_import() can be called against a request context
    that has not had a crypto_ahash_init() performed, the request context
    needs to be cleared to insure there is no random data present. If not,
    the random data can result in a kernel oops during crypto_ahash_update().

    Commit 8996eafdcbad ("crypto: ahash - ensure statesize is non-zero")
    added a check to prevent ahash algorithms from successfully registering
    if the import and export functions were not implemented. This prevents
    an oops in the hash_accept function of algif_hash. This commit causes
    the ccp-crypto module SHA support and AES CMAC support from successfully
    registering and causing the ccp-crypto module load to fail because the
    ahash import and export functions are not implemented.
    
    Update the CCP Crypto API support to provide import and export support
    for ahash algorithms.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix double-free in error paths after snd_usb_add_audio_stream() call
    
    commit 836b34a935abc91e13e63053d0a83b24dfb5ea78 upstream.
    
    create_fixed_stream_quirk(), snd_usb_parse_audio_interface() and
    create_uaxx_quirk() functions allocate the audioformat object by themselves
    and free it upon error before returning. However, once the object is linked
    to a stream, it's freed again in snd_usb_audio_pcm_free(), thus it'll be
    double-freed, eventually resulting in a memory corruption.
    
    This patch fixes these failures in the error paths by unlinking the audioformat
    object before freeing it.
    
    Based on a patch by Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>
    
    [Note for stable backports:
     this patch requires the commit 902eb7fd1e4a ('ALSA: usb-audio: Minor

    commit 9c6ba456711687b794dcf285856fc14e2c76074f upstream.
    
    The powermate driver expects at least one valid USB endpoint in its
    probe function.  If given malicious descriptors that specify 0 for
    the number of endpoints, it will crash.  Validate the number of
    endpoints on the interface before using them.

    A Fedora user reports that the ftdi_sio driver works properly for the
    ICP DAS I-7561U device.  Further, the user manual for these devices
    instructs users to load the driver and add the ids using the sysfs
    interface.
    
    Add support for these in the driver directly so that the devices work
    out of the box instead of needing manual configuration.

    commit 4ec0ef3a82125efc36173062a50624550a900ae0 upstream.
    
    The iowarrior driver expects at least one valid endpoint.  If given
    malicious descriptors that specify 0 for the number of endpoints,
    it will crash in the probe function.  Ensure there is at least
    one endpoint on the interface before using it.

    commit 55ff8cfbc4e12a7d2187df523938cc671fbebdd1 upstream.
    
    The uas driver can never queue more then MAX_CMNDS (- 1) tags and tags
    are shared between luns, so there is no need to claim that we can_queue
    some random large number.
    
    Not claiming that we can_queue 65536 commands, fixes the uas driver
    failing to initialize while allocating the tag map with a "Page allocation
    failure (order 7)" error on systems which have been running for a while
    and thus have fragmented memory.

    usb: retry reset if a device times out
    
    commit 264904ccc33c604d4b3141bbd33808152dfac45b upstream.
    
    Some devices I got show an inability to operate right after
    power on if they are already connected. They are beyond recovery
    if the descriptors are requested multiple times. So in case of
    a timeout we rather bail early and reset again. But it must be
    done only on the first loop lest we get into a reset/time out
    spiral that can be overcome with a retry.
    
    This patch is a rework of a patch that fell through the cracks.

    dm: fix rq_end_stats() NULL pointer in dm_requeue_original_request()
    
    commit 98dbc9c6c61698792e3a66f32f3bf066201d42d7 upstream.
    
    An "old" (.request_fn) DM 'struct request' stores a pointer to the
    associated 'struct dm_rq_target_io' in rq->special.
    
    dm_requeue_original_request(), previously named
    dm_requeue_unmapped_original_request(), called dm_unprep_request() to
    reset rq->special to NULL.  But rq_end_stats() would go on to hit a NULL
    pointer deference because its call to tio_from_request() returned NULL.
    
    Fix this by calling rq_end_stats() _before_ dm_unprep_request()

    dm: fix excessive dm-mq context switching
    
    commit 6acfe68bac7e6f16dc312157b1fa6e2368985013 upstream.
    
    Request-based DM's blk-mq support (dm-mq) was reported to be 50% slower
    than if an underlying null_blk device were used directly.  One of the
    reasons for this drop in performance is that blk_insert_clone_request()
    was calling blk_mq_insert_request() with @async=true.  This forced the
    use of kblockd_schedule_delayed_work_on() to run the blk-mq hw queues
    which ushered in ping-ponging between process context (fio in this case)
    and kblockd's kworker to submit the cloned request.  The ftrace
    function_graph tracer showed:
    
      kworker-2013  =>   fio-12190
      fio-12190    =>  kworker-2013
      ...
      kworker-2013  =>   fio-12190
      fio-12190    =>  kworker-2013
      ...
    
    Fixing blk_insert_clone_request()'s blk_mq_insert_request() call to
    _not_ use kblockd to submit the cloned requests isn't enough to
    eliminate the observed context switches.
    
    In addition to this dm-mq specific blk-core fix, there are 2 DM core
    fixes to dm-mq that (when paired with the blk-core fix) completely
    eliminate the observed context switching:
    
    1)  don't blk_mq_run_hw_queues in blk-mq request completion
    
        Motivated by desire to reduce overhead of dm-mq, punting to kblockd
        just increases context switches.
    
        In my testing against a really fast null_blk device there was no benefit
        to running blk_mq_run_hw_queues() on completion (and no other blk-mq
        driver does this).  So hopefully this change doesn't induce the need for
        yet another revert like commit 621739b00e16ca2d !
    
    2)  use blk_mq_complete_request() in dm_complete_request()
    
        blk_complete_request() doesn't offer the traditional q->mq_ops vs
        .request_fn branching pattern that other historic block interfaces
        do (e.g. blk_get_request).  Using blk_mq_complete_request() for
        blk-mq requests is important for performance.  It should be noted
        that, like blk_complete_request(), blk_mq_complete_request() doesn't
        natively handle partial completions -- but the request-based
        DM-multipath target does provide the required partial completion
        support by dm.c:end_clone_bio() triggering requeueing of the request
        via dm-mpath.c:multipath_end_io()'s return of DM_ENDIO_REQUEUE.
    
    dm-mq fix #2 is _much_ more important than #1 for eliminating the
    context switches.
    Before: cpu          : usr=15.10%, sys=59.39%, ctx=7905181, majf=0, minf=475
    After:  cpu          : usr=20.60%, sys=79.35%, ctx=2008, majf=0, minf=472
    
    With these changes multithreaded async read IOPs improved from ~950K
    to ~1350K for this dm-mq stacked on null_blk test-case.  The raw read
    IOPs of the underlying null_blk device for the same workload is ~1950K.

    scsi: storvsc: fix SRB_STATUS_ABORTED handling
    
    commit ff06c5ffbcb4ffa542fb80c897be977956fafecc upstream.
    
    Commit 3209f9d780d1 ("scsi: storvsc: Fix a bug in the handling of SRB
    status flags") filtered SRB_STATUS_AUTOSENSE_VALID out effectively making
    the (SRB_STATUS_ABORTED | SRB_STATUS_AUTOSENSE_VALID) case a dead code. The
    logic from this branch (e.g. storvsc_device_scan() call) is still required,
    fix the check.

    aacraid: Set correct msix count for EEH recovery
    
    commit ecc479e00db8eb110b200afe1effcb3df20ca7ae upstream.
    
    During EEH recovery number of online CPU's might change thereby changing
    the number of MSIx vectors. Since each fib is allocated to a vector,
    changes in the number of vectors causes fib to be sent thru invalid
    vectors.In addition the correct number of MSIx vectors is not updated in
    the INIT struct sent to the controller, when it is reinitialized.
    
    Fixed by reassigning vectors to fibs based on the updated number of MSIx
    vectors and updating the INIT structure before sending to controller.

    aacraid: Fix RRQ overload
    
    commit 3f4ce057d51a9c0ed9b01ba693df685d230ffcae upstream.
    
    The driver utilizes an array of atomic variables to keep track of IO
    submissions to each vector. To submit an IO multiple threads iterate
    through the array to find a vector which has empty slots to send an
    IO. The reading and updating of the variable is not atomic, causing race
    conditions when a thread uses a full vector to submit an IO.
    
    Fixed by mapping each FIB to a vector, the submission path then uses
    said vector to submit IO thereby removing the possibly of a race
    condition.The vector assignment is started from 1 since vector 0 is
    reserved for the use of AIF management FIBS.If the number of MSIx
    vectors is 1 (MSI or INTx mode) then all the fibs are allocated to
    vector 0.

    sg: fix dxferp in from_to case
    
    commit 5ecee0a3ee8d74b6950cb41e8989b0c2174568d4 upstream.
    
    One of the strange things that the original sg driver did was let the
    user provide both a data-out buffer (it followed the sg_header+cdb)
    _and_ specify a reply length greater than zero. What happened was that
    the user data-out buffer was copied into some kernel buffers and then
    the mid level was told a read type operation would take place with the
    data from the device overwriting the same kernel buffers. The user would
    then read those kernel buffers back into the user space.
    
    From what I can tell, the above action was broken by commit fad7f01e61bf
    ("sg: set dxferp to NULL for READ with the older SG interface") in 2008
    and syzkaller found that out recently.
    
    Make sure that a user space pointer is passed through when data follows
    the sg_header structure and command.  Fix the abnormal case when a
    non-zero reply_len is also given.

    x86/iopl/64: Properly context-switch IOPL on Xen PV
    
    commit b7a584598aea7ca73140cb87b40319944dd3393f upstream.
    
    On Xen PV, regs->flags doesn't reliably reflect IOPL and the
    exit-to-userspace code doesn't change IOPL.  We need to context
    switch it manually.
    
    I'm doing this without going through paravirt because this is
    specific to Xen PV.  After the dust settles, we can merge this with
    the 32-bit code, tidy up the iopl syscall implementation, and remove
    the set_iopl pvop entirely.
    
    Fixes XSA-171.

    x86/irq: Cure live lock in fixup_irqs()
    
    commit 551adc60573cb68e3d55cacca9ba1b7437313df7 upstream.
    
    Harry reported, that he's able to trigger a system freeze with cpu hot
    unplug. The freeze turned out to be a live lock caused by recent changes in
    irq_force_complete_move().
    
    When fixup_irqs() and from there irq_force_complete_move() is called on the
    dying cpu, then all other cpus are in stop machine an wait for the dying cpu
    to complete the teardown. If there is a move of an interrupt pending then
    irq_force_complete_move() sends the cleanup IPI to the cpus in the old_domain
    mask and waits for them to clear the mask. That's obviously impossible as
    those cpus are firmly stuck in stop machine with interrupts disabled.
    
    I should have known that, but I completely overlooked it being concentrated on
    the locking issues around the vectors. And the existance of the call to
    __irq_complete_move() in the code, which actually sends the cleanup IPI made
    it reasonable to wait for that cleanup to complete. That call was bogus even
    before the recent changes as it was just a pointless distraction.
    
    We have to look at two cases:
    
    1) The move_in_progress flag of the interrupt is set
    
       This means the ioapic has been updated with the new vector, but it has not
       fired yet. In theory there is a race:
    
       set_ioapic(new_vector) <-- Interrupt is raised before update is effective,
                                  i.e. it's raised on the old vector.
    
       So if the target cpu cannot handle that interrupt before the old vector is
       cleaned up, we get a spurious interrupt and in the worst case the ioapic
       irq line becomes stale, but my experiments so far have only resulted in
       spurious interrupts.
    
       But in case of cpu hotplug this should be a non issue because if the
       affinity update happens right before all cpus rendevouz in stop machine,
       there is no way that the interrupt can be blocked on the target cpu because
       all cpus loops first with interrupts enabled in stop machine, so the old
       vector is not yet cleaned up when the interrupt fires.
    
       So the only way to run into this issue is if the delivery of the interrupt
       on the apic/system bus would be delayed beyond the point where the target
       cpu disables interrupts in stop machine. I doubt that it can happen, but at
       least there is a theroretical chance. Virtualization might be able to
       expose this, but AFAICT the IOAPIC emulation is not as stupid as the real
       hardware.
    
       I've spent quite some time over the weekend to enforce that situation,
       though I was not able to trigger the delayed case.
    
    2) The move_in_progress flag is not set and the old_domain cpu mask is not
       empty.
    
       That means, that an interrupt was delivered after the change and the
       cleanup IPI has been sent to the cpus in old_domain, but not all CPUs have
       responded to it yet.
    
    In both cases we can assume that the next interrupt will arrive on the new
    vector, so we can cleanup the old vectors on the cpus in the old_domain cpu
    mask.

    PCI: ACPI: IA64: fix IO port generic range check
    
    commit 4a2e7aab4ffce1e0e79b303dc2f9a03aa9f3a332 upstream.
    
    The [0 - 64k] ACPI PCI IO port resource boundary check in:
    
    acpi_dev_ioresource_flags()
    
    is currently applied blindly in the ACPI resource parsing to all
    architectures, but only x86 suffers from that IO space limitation.
    
    On arches (ie IA64 and ARM64) where IO space is memory mapped,
    the PCI root bridges IO resource windows are firstly initialized from
    the _CRS (in acpi_decode_space()) and contain the CPU physical address
    at which a root bridge decodes IO space in the CPU physical address
    space with the offset value representing the offset required to translate
    the PCI bus address into the CPU physical address.
    
    The IO resource windows are then parsed and updated in arch code
    before creating and enumerating PCI buses (eg IA64 add_io_space())
    to map in an arch specific way the obtained CPU physical address range
    to a slice of virtual address space reserved to map PCI IO space,
    ending up with PCI bridges resource windows containing IO
    resources like the following on a working IA64 configuration:
    
    PCI host bridge to bus 0000:00
    pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x1000000-0x100ffff window] (bus
    address [0x0000-0xffff])
    pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x000a0000-0x000fffff window]
    pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x80000000-0x8fffffff window]
    pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x80004000000-0x800ffffffff window]

    This implies that the [0 - 64K] check in acpi_dev_ioresource_flags()
    leaves platforms with memory mapped IO space (ie IA64) broken (ie kernel

    For this reason, the IO port resources boundaries check in generic ACPI
    parsing code should be guarded with a CONFIG_X86 guard so that more arches
    (ie ARM64) can benefit from the generic ACPI resources parsing interface
    without incurring in unexpected resource filtering, fixing at the same
    time current breakage on IA64.
    
    This patch factors out IO ports boundary [0 - 64k] check in generic ACPI
    code and makes the IO space check X86 specific to make sure that IO
    space resources are usable on other arches too.

    PCI: Disable IO/MEM decoding for devices with non-compliant BARs
    
    commit b84106b4e2290c081cdab521fa832596cdfea246 upstream.
    
    The PCI config header (first 64 bytes of each device's config space) is
    defined by the PCI spec so generic software can identify the device and
    manage its usage of I/O, memory, and IRQ resources.
    
    Some non-spec-compliant devices put registers other than BARs where the
    BARs should be.  When the PCI core sizes these "BARs", the reads and writes
    it does may have unwanted side effects, and the "BAR" may appear to
    describe non-sensical address space.
    
    Add a flag bit to mark non-compliant devices so we don't touch their BARs.
    Turn off IO/MEM decoding to prevent the devices from consuming address
    space, since we can't read the BARs to find out what that address space
    would be.

    s390: fix floating pointer register corruption (again)
    
    commit e370e4769463a65dcf8806fa26d2874e0542ac41 upstream.
    
    There is a tricky interaction between the machine check handler
    and the critical sections of load_fpu_regs and save_fpu_regs
    functions. If the machine check interrupts one of the two
    functions the critical section cleanup will complete the function
    before the machine check handler s390_do_machine_check is called.
    Trouble is that the machine check handler needs to validate the
    floating point registers *before* and not *after* the completion
    of load_fpu_regs/save_fpu_regs.
    
    The simplest solution is to rewind the PSW to the start of the
    load_fpu_regs/save_fpu_regs and retry the function after the
    return from the machine check handler.

    EDAC/sb_edac: Fix computation of channel address
    
    commit eb1af3b71f9d83e45f2fd2fd649356e98e1c582c upstream.
    
    Large memory Haswell-EX systems with multiple DIMMs per channel were
    sometimes reporting the wrong DIMM.
    
    Found three problems:
    
     1) Debug printouts for socket and channel interleave were not interpreting
        the register fields correctly. The socket interleave field is a 2^X
        value (0=1, 1=2, 2=4, 3=8). The channel interleave is X+1 (0=1, 1=2,
        2=3. 3=4).
    
     2) Actual use of the socket interleave value didn't interpret as 2^X
    
     3) Conversion of address to channel address was complicated, and wrong.

    sched/cputime: Fix steal_account_process_tick() to always return jiffies
    
    commit f9c904b7613b8b4c85b10cd6b33ad41b2843fa9d upstream.
    
    The callers of steal_account_process_tick() expect it to return
    whether a jiffy should be considered stolen or not.
    
    Currently the return value of steal_account_process_tick() is in
    units of cputime, which vary between either jiffies or nsecs
    depending on CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN.
    
    If cputime has nsecs granularity and there is a tiny amount of
    stolen time (a few nsecs, say) then we will consider the entire
    tick stolen and will not account the tick on user/system/idle,
    causing /proc/stats to show invalid data.
    
    The fix is to change steal_account_process_tick() to accumulate
    the stolen time and only account it once it's worth a jiffy.

        Thermal: initialize thermal zone device correctly
    
        After thermal zone device registered, as we have not read any

        which actually means 0C, and thermal trend is not available.
        In this case, we need specially handling for the first

        Both thermal core framework and step_wise governor is
        enhanced to handle this. And since the step_wise governor
        is the only one that uses trends, so it's the only thermal
        governor that needs to be updated.

    perf tools: Fix python extension build
    
    commit 67d5268908283c187e0a460048a423256c2fb288 upstream.
    
    The util/python-ext-sources file contains source files required to build
    the python extension relative to $(srctree)/tools/perf,
    
    Such a file path $(FILE).c is handed over to the python extension build
    system, which builds the final object in the
    $(PYTHON_EXTBUILD)/tmp/$(FILE).o path.
    
    After the build is done all files from $(PYTHON_EXTBUILD)lib/ are
    carried as the result binaries.
    
    Above system fails when we add source file relative to ../lib, which we
    do for:
    
      ../lib/bitmap.c
      ../lib/find_bit.c
      ../lib/hweight.c
      ../lib/rbtree.c
    
    All above objects will be built like:
    
      $(PYTHON_EXTBUILD)/tmp/../lib/bitmap.c
      $(PYTHON_EXTBUILD)/tmp/../lib/find_bit.c
      $(PYTHON_EXTBUILD)/tmp/../lib/hweight.c
      $(PYTHON_EXTBUILD)/tmp/../lib/rbtree.c
    
    which accidentally happens to be final library path:
    
      $(PYTHON_EXTBUILD)/lib/
    
    Changing setup.py to pass full paths of source files to Extension build
    class and thus keep all built objects under $(PYTHON_EXTBUILD)tmp
    directory.

    perf tools: Dont stop PMU parsing on alias parse error
    
    commit 940db6dcd3f4659303fdf6befe7416adc4d24118 upstream.
    
    When an error happens during alias parsing currently the complete
    parsing of all attributes of the PMU is stopped. This is breaks old perf
    on a newer kernel that may have not-yet-know alias attributes (such as
    .scale or .per-pkg).
    
    Continue when some attribute is unparseable.
    
    This is IMHO a stable candidate and should be backported to older
    versions to avoid problems with newer kernels.

    perf/core: Fix perf_sched_count derailment
    
    commit 927a5570855836e5d5859a80ce7e91e963545e8f upstream.
    
    The error path in perf_event_open() is such that asking for a sampling
    event on a PMU that doesn't generate interrupts will end up in dropping
    the perf_sched_count even though it hasn't been incremented for this
    event yet.
    
    Given a sufficient amount of these calls, we'll end up disabling
    scheduler's jump label even though we'd still have active events in the
    system, thereby facilitating the arrival of the infernal regions upon us.
    
    I'm fixing this by moving account_event() inside perf_event_alloc().

    KVM: VMX: fix nested vpid for old KVM guests
    
    commit ef697a712a6165aea7779c295604b099e8bfae2e upstream.
    
    Old KVM guests invoke single-context invvpid without actually checking
    whether it is supported.  This was fixed by commit 518c8ae ("KVM: VMX:
    Make sure single type invvpid is supported before issuing invvpid
    instruction", 2010-08-01) and the patch after, but pre-2.6.36
    kernels lack it including RHEL 6.

    KVM: fix spin_lock_init order on x86
    
    commit e9ad4ec8379ad1ba6f68b8ca1c26b50b5ae0a327 upstream.
    
    Moving the initialization earlier is needed in 4.6 because
    kvm_arch_init_vm is now using mmu_lock, causing lockdep to
    complain:
    
    [  284.440294] INFO: trying to register non-static key.

    However, it also helps fixing a preexisting problem, which is why this
    patch is also good for stable kernels: kvm_create_vm was incrementing
    current->mm->mm_count but not decrementing it at the out_err label (in
    case kvm_init_mmu_notifier failed).  The new initialization order makes
    it possible to add the required mmdrop without adding a new error label.

    KVM: i8254: change PIT discard tick policy
    
    commit 7dd0fdff145c5be7146d0ac06732ae3613412ac1 upstream.
    
    Discard policy uses ack_notifiers to prevent injection of PIT interrupts
    before EOI from the last one.
    
    This patch changes the policy to always try to deliver the interrupt,
    which makes a difference when its vector is in ISR.
    Old implementation would drop the interrupt, but proposed one injects to
    IRR, like real hardware would.
    
    The old policy breaks legacy NMI watchdogs, where PIT is used through
    virtual wire (LVT0): PIT never sends an interrupt before receiving EOI,
    thus a guest deadlock with disabled interrupts will stop NMIs.
    
    Note that NMI doesn't do EOI, so PIT also had to send a normal interrupt
    through IOAPIC.  (KVM's PIT is deeply rotten and luckily not used much
    in modern systems.)
    
    Even though there is a chance of regressions, I think we can fix the
    LVT0 NMI bug without introducing a new tick policy.

    Sometimes when setting a breakpoint a process doesn't stop on it.

    The Home Agent and PCU PCI devices in Broadwell-EP have a non-BAR register
    where a BAR should be.  We don't know what the side effects of sizing the
    "BAR" would be, and we don't know what address space the "BAR" might appear
    to describe.

    x86/entry/compat: Keep TS_COMPAT set during signal delivery
    
    commit 4e79e182b419172e35936a47f098509092d69817 upstream.
    
    Signal delivery needs to know the sign of an interrupted syscall's
    return value in order to detect -ERESTART variants.  Normally this
    works independently of bitness because syscalls internally return
    long.  Under ptrace, however, this can break, and syscall_get_error
    is supposed to sign-extend regs->ax if needed.
    
    We were clearing TS_COMPAT too early, though, and this prevented
    sign extension, which subtly broke syscall restart under ptrace.

    So untangle it from the BLK_DEV_INITRD dependency so that oldconfig

    the supported methods for supplying microcode are.

    get a harmless build warning:
    
    ../drivers/mmc/host/sh_mmcif.c: In function 'sh_mmcif_request_dma_one':
    ../drivers/mmc/host/sh_mmcif.c:417:4: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
        (void *)pdata->slave_id_tx :
        ^
    ../drivers/mmc/host/sh_mmcif.c:418:4: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
        (void *)pdata->slave_id_rx;
    
    This could be worked around by adding another cast to uintptr_t, but
    I decided to simplify the code a little more to avoid that. This
    splits out the platform data using code into a separate function
    and builds that only for CONFIG_SUPERH. This part still has a typecast
    but does not need a second one. The SH platform code could be further
    modified to pass a pointer directly as we do on other architectures
    when we have a filter function.
    
    The normal case is simplified further and now just calls
    dma_request_slave_channel() directly without going through the
    compat handling.

    ASoC: samsung: pass DMA channels as pointers
    
    commit b9a1a743818ea3265abf98f9431623afa8c50c86 upstream.
    
    ARM64 allmodconfig produces a bunch of warnings when building the
    samsung ASoC code:
    
    sound/soc/samsung/dmaengine.c: In function 'samsung_asoc_init_dma_data':
    sound/soc/samsung/dmaengine.c:53:32: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
       playback_data->filter_data = (void *)playback->channel;
    sound/soc/samsung/dmaengine.c:60:31: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
       capture_data->filter_data = (void *)capture->channel;
    
    We could easily shut up the warning by adding an intermediate cast,
    but there is a bigger underlying problem: The use of IORESOURCE_DMA
    to pass data from platform code to device drivers is dubious to start
    with, as what we really want is a pointer that can be passed into
    a filter function.
    
    Note that on s3c64xx, the pl08x DMA data is already a pointer, but
    gets cast to resource_size_t so we can pass it as a resource, and it
    then gets converted back to a pointer. In contrast, the data we pass
    for s3c24xx is an index into a device specific table, and we artificially
    convert that into a pointer for the filter function.

    regulator: core: Fix nested locking of supplies
    
    commit 70a7fb80e85ae7f78f8e90cec3fbd862ea6a4d4b upstream.
    
    Commit fa731ac7ea04 ("regulator: core: avoid unused variable warning")
    introduced a subtle change in how supplies are locked. Where previously
    code was always locking the regulator of the current iteration, the new
    implementation only locks the regulator if it has a supply. For any
    given power tree that means that the root will never get locked.
    
    On the other hand the regulator_unlock_supply() will still release all
    the locks, which in turn causes the lock debugging code to warn about a
    mutex being unlocked which wasn't locked.

    regulator: core: avoid unused variable warning
    
    commit fa731ac7ea04a7d3a5c6d2f568132478c02a83b3 upstream.
    
    The second argument of the mutex_lock_nested() helper is only
    evaluated if CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC is set. Otherwise we
    get this build warning for the new regulator_lock_supply
    function:
    
    drivers/regulator/core.c: In function 'regulator_lock_supply':
    drivers/regulator/core.c:142:6: warning: unused variable 'i' [-Wunused-variable]
    
    To avoid the warning, this restructures the code to make it
    both simpler and to move the 'i++' outside of the mutex_lock_nested
    call, where it is now always used and the variable is not
    flagged as unused.
    
    We had some discussion about changing mutex_lock_nested to an
    inline function, which would make the code do the right thing here,
    but in the end decided against it, in order to guarantee that
    mutex_lock_nested() does not introduced overhead without
    CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC.

    s390/cpumf: Fix lpp detection
    
    commit 7a76aa95f6f6682db5629449d763251d1c9f8c4e upstream.
    
    we have to check bit 40 of the facility list before issuing LPP
    and not bit 48. Otherwise a guest running on a system with
    "The decimal-floating-point zoned-conversion facility" and without
    the "The set-program-parameters facility" might crash on an lpp
    instruction.
