    x86_32, entry: Do syscall exit work on badsys (CVE-2014-4508)
    
    commit 554086d85e71f30abe46fc014fea31929a7c6a8a upstream.
    
    The bad syscall nr paths are their own incomprehensible route
    through the entry control flow.  Rearrange them to work just like
    syscalls that return -ENOSYS.
    
    This fixes an OOPS in the audit code when fast-path auditing is
    enabled and sysenter gets a bad syscall nr (CVE-2014-4508).
    
    This has probably been broken since Linux 2.6.27:
    af0575bba0 i386 syscall audit fast-path

    Target/iser: Improve cm events handling
    
    commit 88c4015fda6d014392f76d3b1688347950d7a12d upstream.
    
    There are 4 RDMA_CM events that all basically mean that
    the user should teardown the IB connection:
    - DISCONNECTED
    - ADDR_CHANGE
    - DEVICE_REMOVAL
    - TIMEWAIT_EXIT
    
    Only in DISCONNECTED/ADDR_CHANGE it makes sense to
    call rdma_disconnect (send DREQ/DREP to our initiator).
    So we keep the same teardown handler for all of them
    but only indicate calling rdma_disconnect for the relevant
    events.
    
    This patch also removes redundant debug prints for each single
    event.
    
    v2 changes:
     - Call isert_disconnected_handler() for DEVICE_REMOVAL (Or + Sag)

    btrfs: fix use of uninit "ret" in end_extent_writepage()
    
    commit 3e2426bd0eb980648449e7a2f5a23e3cd3c7725c upstream.
    
    If this condition in end_extent_writepage() is false:
    
            if (tree->ops && tree->ops->writepage_end_io_hook)
    
    we will then test an uninitialized "ret" at:
    
            ret = ret < 0 ? ret : -EIO;
    
    The test for ret is for the case where ->writepage_end_io_hook
    failed, and we'd choose that ret as the error; but if
    there is no ->writepage_end_io_hook, nothing sets ret.
    
    Initializing ret to 0 should be sufficient; if
    writepage_end_io_hook wasn't set, (!uptodate) means
    non-zero err was passed in, so we choose -EIO in that case.

    Btrfs: send, don't error in the presence of subvols/snapshots
    
    commit 1af56070e3ef9477dbc7eba3b9ad7446979c7974 upstream.
    
    If we are doing an incremental send and the base snapshot has a
    directory with name X that doesn't exist anymore in the second
    snapshot and a new subvolume/snapshot exists in the second snapshot
    that has the same name as the directory (name X), the incremental
    send would fail with -ENOENT error. This is because it attempts
    to lookup for an inode with a number matching the objectid of a
    root, which doesn't exist.
    
    Steps to reproduce:
    
        mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdd
        mount /dev/sdd /mnt
    
        mkdir /mnt/testdir
        btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt /mnt/mysnap1
    
        rmdir /mnt/testdir
        btrfs subvolume create /mnt/testdir
        btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt /mnt/mysnap2
    
        btrfs send -p /mnt/mysnap1 /mnt/mysnap2 -f /tmp/send.data

    Btrfs: set right total device count for seeding support
    
    commit 298658414a2f0bea1f05a81876a45c1cd96aa2e0 upstream.
    
    Seeding device support allows us to create a new filesystem
    based on existed filesystem.
    
    However newly created filesystem's @total_devices should include seed
    devices. This patch fix the following problem:
    
     # mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
     # btrfstune -S 1 /dev/sdb
     # mount /dev/sdb /mnt
     # btrfs device add -f /dev/sdc /mnt --->fs_devices->total_devices = 1
     # umount /mnt
     # mount /dev/sdc /mnt               --->fs_devices->total_devices = 2
    
    This is because we record right @total_devices in superblock, but
    @fs_devices->total_devices is reset to be 0 in btrfs_prepare_sprout().
    
    Fix this problem by not resetting @fs_devices->total_devices.

    aio: fix kernel memory disclosure in io_getevents() introduced in v3.10
    
    commit edfbbf388f293d70bf4b7c0bc38774d05e6f711a upstream.
    
    A kernel memory disclosure was introduced in aio_read_events_ring() in v3.10
    by commit a31ad380bed817aa25f8830ad23e1a0480fef797.  The changes made to
    aio_read_events_ring() failed to correctly limit the index into
    ctx->ring_pages[], allowing an attacked to cause the subsequent kmap() of
    an arbitrary page with a copy_to_user() to copy the contents into userspace.
    This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2014-0206.  Thanks to Mateusz and
    Petr for disclosing this issue.
    
    This patch applies to v3.12+.  A separate backport is needed for 3.10/3.11.

    The aio cleanups and optimizations by kmo that were merged into the 3.10
    tree added a regression for userspace event reaping.  Specifically, the
    reference counts are not decremented if the event is reaped in userspace,

    genirq: Sanitize spurious interrupt detection of threaded irqs
    
    commit 1e77d0a1ed7417d2a5a52a7b8d32aea1833faa6c upstream.
    
    Till reported that the spurious interrupt detection of threaded
    interrupts is broken in two ways:
    
    - note_interrupt() is called for each action thread of a shared
      interrupt line. That's wrong as we are only interested whether none
      of the device drivers felt responsible for the interrupt, but by
      calling multiple times for a single interrupt line we account
      IRQ_NONE even if one of the drivers felt responsible.
    
    - note_interrupt() when called from the thread handler is not
      serialized. That leaves the members of irq_desc which are used for
      the spurious detection unprotected.
    
    To solve this we need to defer the spurious detection of a threaded
    interrupt to the next hardware interrupt context where we have
    implicit serialization.
    
    If note_interrupt is called with action_ret == IRQ_WAKE_THREAD, we
    check whether the previous interrupt requested a deferred check. If
    not, we request a deferred check for the next hardware interrupt and
    return.
    
    If set, we check whether one of the interrupt threads signaled
    success. Depending on this information we feed the result into the
    spurious detector.
    
    If one primary handler of a shared interrupt returns IRQ_HANDLED we
    disable the deferred check of irq threads on the same line, as we have

    x86, x32: Use compat shims for io_{setup,submit}
    
    commit 7fd44dacdd803c0bbf38bf478d51d280902bb0f1 upstream.
    
    The io_setup takes a pointer to a context id of type aio_context_t.
    This in turn is typed to a __kernel_ulong_t.  We could tweak the
    exported headers to define this as a 64bit quantity for specific
    ABIs, but since we already have a 32bit compat shim for the x86 ABI,
    let's just re-use that logic.  The libaio package is also written to
    expect this as a pointer type, so a compat shim would simplify that.
    
    The io_submit func operates on an array of pointers to iocb structs.
    Padding out the array to be 64bit aligned is a huge pain, so convert
    it over to the existing compat shim too.
    
    We don't convert io_getevents to the compat func as its only purpose
    is to handle the timespec struct, and the x32 ABI uses 64bit times.
    
    With this change, the libaio package can now pass its testsuite when
    built for the x32 ABI.

    x86-32, espfix: Remove filter for espfix32 due to race
    
    commit 246f2d2ee1d715e1077fc47d61c394569c8ee692 upstream.
    
    It is not safe to use LAR to filter when to go down the espfix path,
    because the LDT is per-process (rather than per-thread) and another
    thread might change the descriptors behind our back.  Fortunately it
    is always *safe* (if a bit slow) to go down the espfix path, and a
    32-bit LDT stack segment is extremely rare.

    target: Explicitly clear ramdisk_mcp backend pages
    
    [Note that a different patch to address the same issue went in during
    v3.15-rc1 (commit 4442dc8a), but includes a bunch of other changes that
    don't strictly apply to fixing the bug]
    
    This patch changes rd_allocate_sgl_table() to explicitly clear
    ramdisk_mcp backend memory pages by passing __GFP_ZERO into
    alloc_pages().
    
    This addresses a potential security issue where reading from a
    ramdisk_mcp could return sensitive information, and follows what
    >= v3.15 does to explicitly clear ramdisk_mcp memory at backend
    device initialization time.

    commit 2426bd456a61407388b6e61fc5f98dbcbebc50e2 upstream.
    
    When an initiator sends an allocation length bigger than what its
    command consumes, the target should only return the actual response data
    and set the residual length to the unused part of the allocation length.
    
    Add a helper function that command handlers (INQUIRY, READ CAPACITY,
    etc) can use to do this correctly, and use this code to get the correct
    residual for commands that don't use the full initiator allocation in the
    handlers for READ CAPACITY, READ CAPACITY(16), INQUIRY, MODE SENSE and
    REPORT LUNS.
    
    This addresses a handful of failures as reported by Christophe with
    the Windows Certification Kit:

    iscsi-target: Fix ABORT_TASK + connection reset iscsi_queue_req memory leak
    
    commit bbc050488525e1ab1194c27355f63c66814385b8 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a iscsi_queue_req memory leak when ABORT_TASK response
    has been queued by TFO->queue_tm_rsp() -> lio_queue_tm_rsp() after a
    long standing I/O completes, but the connection has already reset and
    waiting for cleanup to complete in iscsit_release_commands_from_conn()
    -> transport_generic_free_cmd() -> transport_wait_for_tasks() code.
    
    It moves iscsit_free_queue_reqs_for_conn() after the per-connection command
    list has been released, so that the associated se_cmd tag can be completed +
    released by target-core before freeing any remaining iscsi_queue_req memory
    for the connection generated by lio_queue_tm_rsp().

    Target/iser: Fix hangs in connection teardown
    
    commit 9d49f5e284e700576f3b65f1e28dea8539da6661 upstream.
    
    In ungraceful teardowns isert close flows seem racy such that
    isert_wait_conn hangs as RDMA_CM_EVENT_DISCONNECTED never
    gets invoked (no one called rdma_disconnect).
    
    Both graceful and ungraceful teardowns will have rx flush errors
    (isert posts a batch once connection is established). Once all
    flush errors are consumed we invoke isert_wait_conn and it will
    be responsible for calling rdma_disconnect. This way it can be
    sure that rdma_disconnect was called and it won't wait forever.
    
    This patch also removes the logout_posted indicator. either the
    logout completion was consumed and no problem decrementing the
    post_send_buf_count, or it was consumed as a flush error. no point
    of keeping it for isert_wait_conn as there is no danger that
    isert_conn will be accidentally removed while it is running.
    
    (Drop unnecessary sleep_on_conn_wait_comp check in
     isert_cq_rx_comp_err - nab)

    Bluetooth: Fix L2CAP deadlock
    
    commit 8a96f3cd22878fc0bb564a8478a6e17c0b8dca73 upstream.
    
    -[0x01 Introduction
    
    We have found a programming error causing a deadlock in Bluetooth subsystem
    of Linux kernel. The problem is caused by missing release_sock() call when
    L2CAP connection creation fails due full accept queue.
    
    The issue can be reproduced with 3.15-rc5 kernel and is also present in
    earlier kernels.
    
    -[0x02 Details
    
    The problem occurs when multiple L2CAP connections are created to a PSM which
    contains listening socket (like SDP) and left pending, for example,
    configuration (the underlying ACL link is not disconnected between
    connections).
    
    When L2CAP connection request is received and listening socket is found the
    l2cap_sock_new_connection_cb() function (net/bluetooth/l2cap_sock.c) is called.
    This function locks the 'parent' socket and then checks if the accept queue
    is full.
    
    1178         lock_sock(parent);
    1179
    1180         /* Check for backlog size */
    1181         if (sk_acceptq_is_full(parent)) {
    1182                 BT_DBG("backlog full %d", parent->sk_ack_backlog);
    1183                 return NULL;
    1184         }
    
    If case the accept queue is full NULL is returned, but the 'parent' socket
    is not released. Thus when next L2CAP connection request is received the code
    blocks on lock_sock() since the parent is still locked.
    
    Also note that for connections already established and waiting for
    configuration to complete a timeout will occur and l2cap_chan_timeout()
    (net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c) will be called. All threads calling this
    function will also be blocked waiting for the channel mutex since the thread
    which is waiting on lock_sock() alread holds the channel mutex.
    
    We were able to reproduce this by sending continuously L2CAP connection
    request followed by disconnection request containing invalid CID. This left
    the created connections pending configuration.
    
    After the deadlock occurs it is impossible to kill bluetoothd, btmon will not
    get any more data etc. requiring reboot to recover.
    
    -[0x03 Fix
    
    Releasing the 'parent' socket when l2cap_sock_new_connection_cb() returns NULL
    seems to fix the issue.

    ->write_wakeup().
    
    ->write_wakeup() is called with port lock taken and

    The bad pfn:fa442 is not system memory(mem=384M mem=512M@7680M), after debugging,
    I find in page fault handler, will get wrong pfn from pte just after set pte,
    as follow:
    do_anonymous_page()
    {
            ...
            set_pte_at(mm, address, page_table, entry);
    
            //debug code
            pfn = pte_pfn(entry);
            pr_info("pfn:0x%lx, pte:0x%llxn", pfn, pte_val(entry));
    
            //read out the pte just set
            new_pte = pte_offset_map(pmd, address);
            new_pfn = pte_pfn(*new_pte);
            pr_info("new pfn:0x%lx, new pte:0x%llxn", pfn, pte_val(entry));
            ...
    }
    
    pfn:   0x1fa4f5,     pte:0xc00001fa4f575f
    new_pfn:0xfa4f5, new_pte:0xc00000fa4f5f5f       //new pfn/pte is wrong.
    
    The bug is happened in cpu_v7_set_pte_ext(ptep, pte):
    An LPAE PTE is a 64bit quantity, passed to cpu_v7_set_pte_ext in the r2 and r3 registers.
    On an LE kernel, r2 contains the LSB of the PTE, and r3 the MSB.
    On a BE kernel, the assignment is reversed.
    
    Unfortunately, the current code always assumes the LE case,
    leading to corruption of the PTE when clearing/setting bits.
    
    This patch fixes this issue much like it has been done already in the
    cpu_v7_switch_mm case.

    ARM: stacktrace: avoid listing stacktrace functions in stacktrace
    
    commit 3683f44c42e991d313dc301504ee0fca1aeb8580 upstream.
    
    While debugging the FEC ethernet driver using stacktrace, it was noticed
    that the stacktraces always begin as follows:
    
     [<c00117b4>] save_stack_trace_tsk+0x0/0x98
     [<c0011870>] save_stack_trace+0x24/0x28
     ...
    
    This is because the stack trace code includes the stack frames for itself.
    This is incorrect behaviour, and also leads to "skip" doing the wrong
    thing (which is the number of stack frames to avoid recording.)
    
    Perversely, it does the right thing when passed a non-current thread.  Fix
    this by ensuring that we have a known constant number of frames above the
    main stack trace function, and always skip these.

    media: uvcvideo: Fix clock param realtime setting
    
    commit 3b35fc81e7ec552147a4fd843d0da0bbbe4ef253 upstream.
    
    timestamps in v4l2 buffers returned to userspace are updated in
    uvc_video_clock_update() which uses timestamps fetched from
    uvc_video_clock_decode() by calling unconditionally ktime_get_ts().
    
    Hence setting the module clock param to realtime has no effect before
    this patch.
    
    This has been tested with ffmpeg:
    
    ffmpeg -y -f v4l2 -input_format yuyv422 -video_size 640x480 -framerate 30 -i /dev/video0 \

    media: stk1160: Avoid stack-allocated buffer for control URBs
    
    commit 85ac1a1772bb41da895bad83a81f6a62c8f293f6 upstream.
    
    Currently stk1160_read_reg() uses a stack-allocated char to get the
    read control value. This is wrong because usb_control_msg() requires
    a kmalloc-ed buffer.
    
    This commit fixes such issue by kmalloc'ating a 1-byte buffer to receive
    the read value.
    
    While here, let's remove the urb_buf array which was meant for a similar
    purpose, but never really used.

    USB: serial: fix potential runtime pm imbalance at device remove
    
    commit c14829fad88dbeda57253590695b85ba51270621 upstream.
    
    Only call usb_autopm_put_interface() if the corresponding
    usb_autopm_get_interface() was successful.
    
    This prevents a potential runtime PM counter imbalance should
    usb_autopm_get_interface() fail. Note that the USB PM usage counter is
    reset when the interface is unbound, but that the runtime PM counter may
    be left unbalanced.
    
    Also add comment on why we don't need to worry about racing
    resume/suspend on autopm_get failures.

    USB: sierra: fix remote wakeup
    
    commit 80cc0fcbdaeaf10d04ba27779a2d7ceb73d2717a upstream.
    
    Make sure that needs_remote_wake up is always set when there are open
    ports.
    
    Currently close() would unconditionally set needs_remote_wakeup to 0
    even though there might still be open ports. This could lead to blocked
    input and possibly dropped data on devices that do not support remote
    wakeup (and which must therefore not be runtime suspended while open).
    
    Add an open_ports counter (protected by the susp_lock) and only clear
    needs_remote_wakeup when the last port is closed.

    USB: sierra: fix urb and memory leak in resume error path
    
    commit 7fdd26a01eb7b6cb6855ff8f69ef4a720720dfcb upstream.
    
    Neither the transfer buffer or the urb itself were released in the
    resume error path for delayed writes. Also on errors, the remainder of
    the queue was not even processed, which leads to further urb and buffer
    leaks.
    
    The same error path also failed to balance the outstanding-urb counter,
    something which results in degraded throughput or completely blocked
    writes.
    
    Fix this by releasing urb and buffer and balancing counters on errors,
    and by always processing the whole queue even when submission of one urb
    fails.

    USB: usb_wwan: fix potential blocked I/O after resume
    
    commit fb7ad4f93d9f0f7d49beda32f5e7becb94b29a4d upstream.
    
    Keep trying to submit urbs rather than bail out on first read-urb
    submission error, which would also prevent I/O for any further ports
    from being resumed.
    
    Instead keep an error count, for all types of failed submissions, and
    let USB core know that something went wrong.
    
    Also make sure to always clear the suspended flag. Currently a failed
    read-urb submission would prevent cached writes as well as any
    subsequent writes from being submitted until next suspend-resume cycle,
    something which may not even necessarily happen.
    
    Note that USB core currently only logs an error if an interface resume
    failed.

    commit 79eed03e77d481b55d85d1cfe5a1636a0d3897fd upstream.
    
    The delayed-write queue was never emptied at shutdown (close), something
    which could lead to leaked urbs if the port is closed before being
    runtime resumed due to a write.
    
    When this happens the output buffer would not drain on close
    (closing_wait timeout), and after consecutive opens, writes could be
    corrupted with previously buffered data, transfered with reduced
    throughput or completely blocked.
    
    Note that unbusy_queued_urb() was simply moved out of CONFIG_PM.

    commit d9e93c08d8d985e5ef89436ebc9f4aad7e31559f upstream.
    
    We find a race between write and resume. usb_wwan_resume run play_delayed()
    and spin_unlock, but intfdata->suspended still is not set to zero.
    At this time usb_wwan_write is called and anchor the urb to delay
    list. Then resume keep running but the delayed urb have no chance
    to be commit until next resume. If the time of next resume is far
    away, tty will be blocked in tty_wait_until_sent during time. The
    race also can lead to writes being reordered.
    
    This patch put play_Delayed and intfdata->suspended together in the
    spinlock, it's to avoid the write race during resume.

    matroxfb: perform a dummy read of M_STATUS
    
    commit 972754cfaee94d6e25acf94a497bc0a864d91b7e upstream.
    
    I had occasional screen corruption with the matrox framebuffer driver and
    I found out that the reason for the corruption is that the hardware
    blitter accesses the videoram while it is being written to.
    
    The matrox driver has a macro WaitTillIdle() that should wait until the
    blitter is idle, but it sometimes doesn't work. I added a dummy read
    mga_inl(M_STATUS) to WaitTillIdle() to fix the problem. The dummy read
    will flush the write buffer in the PCI chipset, and the next read of
    M_STATUS will return the hardware status.
    
    Since applying this patch, I had no screen corruption at all.

    commit b5b60778558cafad17bbcbf63e0310bd3c68eb17 upstream.
    
    The variable "size" is expressed as number of blocks and not as
    number of clusters, this could trigger a kernel panic when using
    ext4 with the size of a cluster different from the size of a block.

    ext4: fix zeroing of page during writeback
    
    commit eeece469dedadf3918bad50ad80f4616a0064e90 upstream.
    
    Tail of a page straddling inode size must be zeroed when being written
    out due to POSIX requirement that modifications of mmaped page beyond
    inode size must not be written to the file. ext4_bio_write_page() did
    this only for blocks fully beyond inode size but didn't properly zero
    blocks partially beyond inode size. Fix this.
    
    The problem has been uncovered by mmap_11-4 test in openposix test suite
    (part of LTP).

    s390/lowcore: reserve 96 bytes for IRB in lowcore
    
    commit 993072ee67aa179c48c85eb19869804e68887d86 upstream.
    
    The IRB might be 96 bytes if the extended-I/O-measurement facility is
    used. This feature is currently not used by Linux, but struct irb
    already has the emw defined. So let's make the irb in lowcore match the
    size of the internal data structure to be future proof.
    We also have to add a pad, to correctly align the paste.
    
    The bigger irb field also circumvents a bug in some QEMU versions that
    always write the emw field on test subchannel and therefore destroy the
    paste definitions of this CPU. Running under these QEMU version broke
    some timing functions in the VDSO and all users of these functions,
    e.g. some JREs.

    idr: fix overflow bug during maximum ID calculation at maximum height
    
    commit 3afb69cb5572b3c8c898c00880803cf1a49852c4 upstream.
    
    idr_replace() open-codes the logic to calculate the maximum valid ID
    given the height of the idr tree; unfortunately, the open-coded logic
    doesn't account for the fact that the top layer may have unused slots
    and over-shifts the limit to zero when the tree is at its maximum
    height.
    
    The following test code shows it fails to replace the value for
    id=((1<<27)+42):
    
      static void test5(void)
      {
            int id;
            DEFINE_IDR(test_idr);
      #define TEST5_START ((1<<27)+42) /* use the highest layer */
    
            printk(KERN_INFO "Start test5\n");
            id = idr_alloc(&test_idr, (void *)1, TEST5_START, 0, GFP_KERNEL);
            BUG_ON(id != TEST5_START);
            TEST_BUG_ON(idr_replace(&test_idr, (void *)2, TEST5_START) != (void *)1);
            idr_destroy(&test_idr);
            printk(KERN_INFO "End of test5\n");
      }
    
    Fix the bug by using idr_max() which correctly takes into account the
    maximum allowed shift.
    
    sub_alloc() shares the same problem and may incorrectly fail with
    -EAGAIN; however, this bug doesn't affect correct operation because
    idr_get_empty_slot(), which already uses idr_max(), retries with the
    increased @id in such cases.

    arm64: ptrace: change fs when passing kernel pointer to regset code
    
    commit c168870704bcde6bb63d05f7882b620dd3985a46 upstream.
    
    Our compat PTRACE_POKEUSR implementation simply passes the user data to
    regset_copy_from_user after some simple range checking. Unfortunately,
    the data in question has already been copied to the kernel stack by this
    point, so the subsequent access_ok check fails and the ptrace request
    returns -EFAULT. This causes problems tracing fork() with older versions
    of strace.
    
    This patch briefly changes the fs to KERNEL_DS, so that the access_ok
    check passes even with a kernel address.

    ptrace: fix fork event messages across pid namespaces
    
    commit 4e52365f279564cef0ddd41db5237f0471381093 upstream.
    
    When tracing a process in another pid namespace, it's important for fork
    event messages to contain the child's pid as seen from the tracer's pid
    namespace, not the parent's.  Otherwise, the tracer won't be able to
    correlate the fork event with later SIGTRAP signals it receives from the
    child.
    
    We still risk a race condition if a ptracer from a different pid
    namespace attaches after we compute the pid_t value.  However, sending a
    bogus fork event message in this unlikely scenario is still a vast
    improvement over the status quo where we always send bogus fork event
    messages to debuggers in a different pid namespace than the forking
    process.

    This is because the kswapd thread is still marked as a reclaimer at the
    time of exit.  But because it is exiting, nobody is actually waiting on
    it to make reclaim progress anymore, and it's nothing but a regular
    thread at this point.  Be tidy and strip it of all its powers
    (PF_MEMALLOC, PF_SWAPWRITE, PF_KSWAPD, and the lockdep reclaim state)
    before returning from the thread function.

    HID: core: fix validation of report id 0
    
    commit 1b15d2e5b8077670b1e6a33250a0d9577efff4a5 upstream.
    
    Some drivers use the first HID report in the list instead of using an
    index. In these cases, validation uses ID 0, which was supposed to mean
    "first known report". This fixes the problem, which was causing at least
    the lgff family of devices to stop working since hid_validate_values
    was being called with ID 0, but the devices used single numbered IDs
    for their reports:
    
    0x05, 0x01,         /*  Usage Page (Desktop),                   */
    0x09, 0x05,         /*  Usage (Gamepad),                        */
    0xA1, 0x01,         /*  Collection (Application),               */
    0xA1, 0x02,         /*      Collection (Logical),               */
    0x85, 0x01,         /*          Report ID (1),                  */

    mm: fix sleeping function warning from __put_anon_vma
    
    commit 7f39dda9d86fb4f4f17af0de170decf125726f8c upstream.
    
    Trinity reports BUG:

    from inside an rcu_read_lock()ed section: fix the two places that did so.
    And add might_sleep() to anon_vma_free(), as suggested by Peter Zijlstra.

    mm/memory-failure.c: don't let collect_procs() skip over processes for MF_ACTION_REQUIRED
    
    commit 74614de17db6fb472370c426d4f934d8d616edf2 upstream.
    
    When Linux sees an "action optional" machine check (where h/w has reported
    an error that is not in the current execution path) we generally do not
    want to signal a process, since most processes do not have a SIGBUS
    handler - we'd just prematurely terminate the process for a problem that
    they might never actually see.
    
    task_early_kill() decides whether to consider a process - and it checks
    whether this specific process has been marked for early signals with
    "prctl", or if the system administrator has requested early signals for
    all processes using /proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_early_kill.
    
    But for MF_ACTION_REQUIRED case we must not defer.  The error is in the
    execution path of the current thread so we must send the SIGBUS
    immediatley.
    
    Fix by passing a flag argument through collect_procs*() to
    task_early_kill() so it knows whether we can defer or must take action.

    mm/memory-failure.c-failure: send right signal code to correct thread
    
    commit a70ffcac741d31a406c1d2b832ae43d658e7e1cf upstream.
    
    When a thread in a multi-threaded application hits a machine check because
    of an uncorrectable error in memory - we want to send the SIGBUS with
    si.si_code = BUS_MCEERR_AR to that thread.  Currently we fail to do that
    if the active thread is not the primary thread in the process.
    collect_procs() just finds primary threads and this test:
    
            if ((flags & MF_ACTION_REQUIRED) && t == current) {
    
    will see that the thread we found isn't the current thread and so send a
    si.si_code = BUS_MCEERR_AO to the primary (and nothing to the active
    thread at this time).
    
    We can fix this by checking whether "current" shares the same mm with the
    process that collect_procs() said owned the page.  If so, we send the
    SIGBUS to current (with code BUS_MCEERR_AR).

    mm: vmscan: do not throttle based on pfmemalloc reserves if node has no ZONE_NORMAL
    
    commit 675becce15f320337499bc1a9356260409a5ba29 upstream.
    
    throttle_direct_reclaim() is meant to trigger during swap-over-network
    during which the min watermark is treated as a pfmemalloc reserve.  It
    throttes on the first node in the zonelist but this is flawed.
    
    The user-visible impact is that a process running on CPU whose local
    memory node has no ZONE_NORMAL will stall for prolonged periods of time,
    possibly indefintely.  This is due to throttle_direct_reclaim thinking the
    pfmemalloc reserves are depleted when in fact they don't exist on that
    node.
    
    On a NUMA machine running a 32-bit kernel (I know) allocation requests
    from CPUs on node 1 would detect no pfmemalloc reserves and the process
    gets throttled.  This patch adjusts throttling of direct reclaim to
    throttle based on the first node in the zonelist that has a usable
    ZONE_NORMAL or lower zone.

    ARM: OMAP: replace checks for CONFIG_USB_GADGET_OMAP
    
    commit 77c2f02edbeda9409a7cf3fd66233015820c213a upstream.
    
    Commit 193ab2a60700 ("usb: gadget: allow multiple gadgets to be built")
    apparently required that checks for CONFIG_USB_GADGET_OMAP would be
    replaced with checks for CONFIG_USB_OMAP. Do so now for the remaining
    checks for CONFIG_USB_GADGET_OMAP, even though these checks have
    basically been broken since v3.1.
    
    And, since we're touching this code, use the IS_ENABLED() macro, so
    things will now (hopefully) also work if USB_OMAP is modular.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: clear stall when disabling endpoint
    
    commit 687ef9817df7ed960d14575b9033dde3d04631fe upstream.
    
    so it seems like DWC3 IP doesn't clear stalls
    automatically when we disable an endpoint, because
    of that, we _must_ make sure stalls are cleared
    before clearing the proper bit in DALEPENA register.

    basically renamed the Kconfig symbol USB_GADGET_PXA25X to USB_PXA25X. It
    did not rename the related macros in use at that time. Commit
    c0a39151a405 ("ARM: pxa: fix inconsistent CONFIG_USB_PXA27X") did so for
    all but one macro. Rename that last macro too now.

    USB: usbtest: add a timeout for scatter-gather tests
    
    commit 32b36eeae6a859670d2939a7d6136cb5e9ed64f8 upstream.
    
    In usbtest, tests 5 - 8 use the scatter-gather library in usbcore
    without any sort of timeout.  If there's a problem in the gadget or
    host controller being tested, the test can hang.
    
    This patch adds a 10-second timeout to the tests, so that they will
    fail gracefully with an ETIMEDOUT error instead of hanging.

    usb: usbtest: fix unlink write error with pattern 1
    
    commit e4d58f5dcb7d7be45df8def31881ebfae99c75da upstream.
    
    TEST 12 and TEST 24 unlinks the URB write request for N times. When
    host and gadget both initialize pattern 1 (mod 63) data series to
    transfer, the gadget side will complain the wrong data which is not
    expected.  Because in host side, usbtest doesn't fill the data buffer
    as mod 63 and this patch fixed it.

    removed the Kconfig symbol OMAP_MCBSP. It left two checks for
    CONFIG_OMAP_MCBSP untouched.
    
    Convert these to checks for CONFIG_SND_OMAP_SOC_MCBSP. That must be
    correct, since that re-enables calls to functions that are all found in
    sound/soc/omap/mcbsp.c. And that file is built only if
    CONFIG_SND_OMAP_SOC_MCBSP is defined.

    af_iucv: wrong mapping of sent and confirmed skbs
    
    commit f5738e2ef88070ef1372e6e718124d88e9abe4ac upstream.
    
    When sending data through IUCV a MESSAGE COMPLETE interrupt
    signals that sent data memory can be freed or reused again.
    With commit f9c41a62bba3f3f7ef3541b2a025e3371bcbba97
    "af_iucv: fix recvmsg by replacing skb_pull() function" the
    MESSAGE COMPLETE callback iucv_callback_txdone() identifies
    the wrong skb as being confirmed, which leads to data corruption.
    This patch fixes the skb mapping logic in iucv_callback_txdone().

    there's a possibility for an use after free condition at device removal.
    
    This simplified patch introduces an additional variable to prevent the issue.
