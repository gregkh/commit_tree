    fuse: Add FOPEN_STREAM to use stream_open()
    
    commit bbd84f33652f852ce5992d65db4d020aba21f882 upstream.
    
    Starting from commit 9c225f2655e3 ("vfs: atomic f_pos accesses as per
    POSIX") files opened even via nonseekable_open gate read and write via lock
    and do not allow them to be run simultaneously. This can create read vs
    write deadlock if a filesystem is trying to implement a socket-like file
    which is intended to be simultaneously used for both read and write from
    filesystem client.  See commit 10dce8af3422 ("fs: stream_open - opener for
    stream-like files so that read and write can run simultaneously without
    deadlock") for details and e.g. commit 581d21a2d02a ("xenbus: fix deadlock
    on writes to /proc/xen/xenbus") for a similar deadlock example on
    /proc/xen/xenbus.
    
    To avoid such deadlock it was tempting to adjust fuse_finish_open to use
    stream_open instead of nonseekable_open on just FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE flags,
    but grepping through Debian codesearch shows users of FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE,
    and in particular GVFS which actually uses offset in its read and write
    handlers
    
            https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=-%3Enonseekable+%3D
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1080
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1247-1346
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1399-1481
    
    so if we would do such a change it will break a real user.
    
    Add another flag (FOPEN_STREAM) for filesystem servers to indicate that the
    opened handler is having stream-like semantics; does not use file position
    and thus the kernel is free to issue simultaneous read and write request on
    opened file handle.
    
    This patch together with stream_open() should be added to stable kernels
    starting from v3.14+. This will allow to patch OSSPD and other FUSE
    filesystems that provide stream-like files to return FOPEN_STREAM |
    FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE in open handler and this way avoid the deadlock on all
    kernel versions. This should work because fuse_finish_open ignores unknown
    open flags returned from a filesystem and so passing FOPEN_STREAM to a
    kernel that is not aware of this flag cannot hurt. In turn the kernel that
    is not aware of FOPEN_STREAM will be < v3.14 where just FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE
    is sufficient to implement streams without read vs write deadlock.

    fs: stream_open - opener for stream-like files so that read and write can run simultaneously without deadlock
    
    commit 10dce8af34226d90fa56746a934f8da5dcdba3df upstream.
    
    Commit 9c225f2655e3 ("vfs: atomic f_pos accesses as per POSIX") added
    locking for file.f_pos access and in particular made concurrent read and
    write not possible - now both those functions take f_pos lock for the
    whole run, and so if e.g. a read is blocked waiting for data, write will
    deadlock waiting for that read to complete.
    
    This caused regression for stream-like files where previously read and
    write could run simultaneously, but after that patch could not do so
    anymore. See e.g. commit 581d21a2d02a ("xenbus: fix deadlock on writes
    to /proc/xen/xenbus") which fixes such regression for particular case of
    /proc/xen/xenbus.
    
    The patch that added f_pos lock in 2014 did so to guarantee POSIX thread
    safety for read/write/lseek and added the locking to file descriptors of
    all regular files. In 2014 that thread-safety problem was not new as it
    was already discussed earlier in 2006.
    
    However even though 2006'th version of Linus's patch was adding f_pos
    locking "only for files that are marked seekable with FMODE_LSEEK (thus
    avoiding the stream-like objects like pipes and sockets)", the 2014
    version - the one that actually made it into the tree as 9c225f2655e3 -
    is doing so irregardless of whether a file is seekable or not.
    
    See
    
        https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/53022DB1.4070805@gmail.com/
        https://lwn.net/Articles/180387
        https://lwn.net/Articles/180396
    
    for historic context.
    
    The reason that it did so is, probably, that there are many files that
    are marked non-seekable, but e.g. their read implementation actually
    depends on knowing current position to correctly handle the read. Some
    examples:
    
            kernel/power/user.c             snapshot_read
            fs/debugfs/file.c               u32_array_read
            fs/fuse/control.c               fuse_conn_waiting_read + ...
            drivers/hwmon/asus_atk0110.c    atk_debugfs_ggrp_read
            arch/s390/hypfs/inode.c         hypfs_read_iter
            ...
    
    Despite that, many nonseekable_open users implement read and write with
    pure stream semantics - they don't depend on passed ppos at all. And for
    those cases where read could wait for something inside, it creates a
    situation similar to xenbus - the write could be never made to go until
    read is done, and read is waiting for some, potentially external, event,
    for potentially unbounded time -> deadlock.
    
    Besides xenbus, there are 14 such places in the kernel that I've found
    with semantic patch (see below):
    
            drivers/xen/evtchn.c:667:8-24: ERROR: evtchn_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/isdn/capi/capi.c:963:8-24: ERROR: capi_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/input/evdev.c:527:1-17: ERROR: evdev_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()

            net/rfkill/core.c:1146:8-24: ERROR: rfkill_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/s390/char/fs3270.c:488:1-17: ERROR: fs3270_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/usb/misc/ldusb.c:310:1-17: ERROR: ld_usb_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/hid/uhid.c:635:1-17: ERROR: uhid_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            net/batman-adv/icmp_socket.c:80:1-17: ERROR: batadv_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/media/rc/lirc_dev.c:198:1-17: ERROR: lirc_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/leds/uleds.c:77:1-17: ERROR: uleds_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/input/misc/uinput.c:400:1-17: ERROR: uinput_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/infiniband/core/user_mad.c:985:7-23: ERROR: umad_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
            drivers/gnss/core.c:45:1-17: ERROR: gnss_fops: .read() can deadlock .write()
    
    In addition to the cases above another regression caused by f_pos
    locking is that now FUSE filesystems that implement open with
    FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE flag, can no longer implement bidirectional
    stream-like files - for the same reason as above e.g. read can deadlock
    write locking on file.f_pos in the kernel.
    
    FUSE's FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE was added in 2008 in a7c1b990f715 ("fuse:
    implement nonseekable open") to support OSSPD. OSSPD implements /dev/dsp
    in userspace with FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE flag, with corresponding read and
    write routines not depending on current position at all, and with both
    read and write being potentially blocking operations:
    
    See
    
        https://github.com/libfuse/osspd
        https://lwn.net/Articles/308445
    
        https://github.com/libfuse/osspd/blob/14a9cff0/osspd.c#L1406
        https://github.com/libfuse/osspd/blob/14a9cff0/osspd.c#L1438-L1477
        https://github.com/libfuse/osspd/blob/14a9cff0/osspd.c#L1479-L1510
    
    Corresponding libfuse example/test also describes FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE as
    "somewhat pipe-like files ..." with read handler not using offset.
    However that test implements only read without write and cannot exercise
    the deadlock scenario:
    
        https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/fuse-3.4.2-3-ga1bff7d/example/poll.c#L124-L131
        https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/fuse-3.4.2-3-ga1bff7d/example/poll.c#L146-L163
        https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/fuse-3.4.2-3-ga1bff7d/example/poll.c#L209-L216
    
    I've actually hit the read vs write deadlock for real while implementing
    my FUSE filesystem where there is /head/watch file, for which open
    creates separate bidirectional socket-like stream in between filesystem
    and its user with both read and write being later performed
    simultaneously. And there it is semantically not easy to split the
    stream into two separate read-only and write-only channels:
    
        https://lab.nexedi.com/kirr/wendelin.core/blob/f13aa600/wcfs/wcfs.go#L88-169
    
    Let's fix this regression. The plan is:
    
    1. We can't change nonseekable_open to include &~FMODE_ATOMIC_POS -
       doing so would break many in-kernel nonseekable_open users which
       actually use ppos in read/write handlers.
    
    2. Add stream_open() to kernel to open stream-like non-seekable file
       descriptors. Read and write on such file descriptors would never use
       nor change ppos. And with that property on stream-like files read and
       write will be running without taking f_pos lock - i.e. read and write
       could be running simultaneously.
    
    3. With semantic patch search and convert to stream_open all in-kernel
       nonseekable_open users for which read and write actually do not
       depend on ppos and where there is no other methods in file_operations
       which assume @offset access.
    
    4. Add FOPEN_STREAM to fs/fuse/ and open in-kernel file-descriptors via
       steam_open if that bit is present in filesystem open reply.
    
       It was tempting to change fs/fuse/ open handler to use stream_open
       instead of nonseekable_open on just FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE flags, but
       grepping through Debian codesearch shows users of FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE,
       and in particular GVFS which actually uses offset in its read and
       write handlers
    
            https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=-%3Enonseekable+%3D
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1080
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1247-1346
            https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1399-1481
    
       so if we would do such a change it will break a real user.
    
    5. Add stream_open and FOPEN_STREAM handling to stable kernels starting
       from v3.14+ (the kernel where 9c225f2655 first appeared).
    
       This will allow to patch OSSPD and other FUSE filesystems that
       provide stream-like files to return FOPEN_STREAM | FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE
       in their open handler and this way avoid the deadlock on all kernel
       versions. This should work because fs/fuse/ ignores unknown open
       flags returned from a filesystem and so passing FOPEN_STREAM to a
       kernel that is not aware of this flag cannot hurt. In turn the kernel
       that is not aware of FOPEN_STREAM will be < v3.14 where just
       FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE is sufficient to implement streams without read vs
       write deadlock.
    
    This patch adds stream_open, converts /proc/xen/xenbus to it and adds
    semantic patch to automatically locate in-kernel places that are either
    required to be converted due to read vs write deadlock, or that are just
    safe to be converted because read and write do not use ppos and there
    are no other funky methods in file_operations.
    
    Regarding semantic patch I've verified each generated change manually -
    that it is correct to convert - and each other nonseekable_open instance
    left - that it is either not correct to convert there, or that it is not
    converted due to current stream_open.cocci limitations.
    
    The script also does not convert files that should be valid to convert,
    but that currently have .llseek = noop_llseek or generic_file_llseek for
    unknown reason despite file being opened with nonseekable_open (e.g.
    drivers/input/mousedev.c)

    genwqe: Prevent an integer overflow in the ioctl
    
    commit 110080cea0d0e4dfdb0b536e7f8a5633ead6a781 upstream.
    
    There are a couple potential integer overflows here.
    
            round_up(m->size + (m->addr & ~PAGE_MASK), PAGE_SIZE);
    
    The first thing is that the "m->size + (...)" addition could overflow,
    and the second is that round_up() overflows to zero if the result is
    within PAGE_SIZE of the type max.
    
    In this code, the "m->size" variable is an u64 but we're saving the
    result in "map_size" which is an unsigned long and genwqe_user_vmap()
    takes an unsigned long as well.  So I have used ULONG_MAX as the upper
    bound.  From a practical perspective unsigned long is fine/better than
    trying to change all the types to u64.

    MIPS: pistachio: Build uImage.gz by default
    
    commit e4f2d1af7163becb181419af9dece9206001e0a6 upstream.
    
    The pistachio platform uses the U-Boot bootloader & generally boots a
    kernel in the uImage format. As such it's useful to build one when
    building the kernel, but to do so currently requires the user to
    manually specify a uImage target on the make command line.
    
    Make uImage.gz the pistachio platform's default build target, so that
    the default is to build a kernel image that we can actually boot on a
    board such as the MIPS Creator Ci40.
    
    Marked for stable backport as far as v4.1 where pistachio support was
    introduced. This is primarily useful for CI systems such as kernelci.org
    which will benefit from us building a suitable image which can then be
    booted as part of automated testing, extending our test coverage to the
    affected stable branches.

    commit 63923d2c3800919774f5c651d503d1dd2adaddd5 upstream.
    
    We only support I/O to kernel space. Using %sr1 to load the coherence
    index may be racy unless interrupts are disabled. This patch changes the
    code used to load the coherence index to use implicit space register
    selection. This saves one instruction and eliminates the race.
    
    Tested on rp3440, c8000 and c3750.

    rcu: locking and unlocking need to always be at least barriers
    
    commit 66be4e66a7f422128748e3c3ef6ee72b20a6197b upstream.
    
    Herbert Xu pointed out that commit bb73c52bad36 ("rcu: Don't disable
    preemption for Tiny and Tree RCU readers") was incorrect in making the
    preempt_disable/enable() be conditional on CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT.
    
    If CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT isn't enabled, the preemption enable/disable is
    a no-op, but still is a compiler barrier.
    
    And RCU locking still _needs_ that compiler barrier.
    
    It is simply fundamentally not true that RCU locking would be a complete
    no-op: we still need to guarantee (for example) that things that can
    trap and cause preemption cannot migrate into the RCU locked region.
    
    The way we do that is by making it a barrier.
    
    See for example commit 386afc91144b ("spinlocks and preemption points
    need to be at least compiler barriers") from back in 2013 that had
    similar issues with spinlocks that become no-ops on UP: they must still
    constrain the compiler from moving other operations into the critical
    region.
    
    Now, it is true that a lot of RCU operations already use READ_ONCE() and
    WRITE_ONCE() (which in practice likely would never be re-ordered wrt
    anything remotely interesting), but it is also true that that is not
    globally the case, and that it's not even necessarily always possible
    (ie bitfields etc).

    pktgen: do not sleep with the thread lock held.
    
    [ Upstream commit 720f1de4021f09898b8c8443f3b3e995991b6e3a ]
    
    Currently, the process issuing a "start" command on the pktgen procfs
    interface, acquires the pktgen thread lock and never release it, until
    all pktgen threads are completed. The above can blocks indefinitely any
    other pktgen command and any (even unrelated) netdevice removal - as
    the pktgen netdev notifier acquires the same lock.
    
    The issue is demonstrated by the following script, reported by Matteo:
    
    ip -b - <<'EOF'
            link add type dummy
            link add type veth
            link set dummy0 up
    EOF
    modprobe pktgen
    echo reset >/proc/net/pktgen/pgctrl
    {
            echo rem_device_all
            echo add_device dummy0
    } >/proc/net/pktgen/kpktgend_0
    echo count 0 >/proc/net/pktgen/dummy0
    echo start >/proc/net/pktgen/pgctrl &
    sleep 1
    rmmod veth
    
    Fix the above releasing the thread lock around the sleep call.
    
    Additionally we must prevent racing with forcefull rmmod - as the
    thread lock no more protects from them. Instead, acquire a self-reference
    before waiting for any thread. As a side effect, running
    
    rmmod pktgen
    
    while some thread is running now fails with "module in use" error,
    before this patch such command hanged indefinitely.
    
    Note: the issue predates the commit reported in the fixes tag, but
    this fix can't be applied before the mentioned commit.
    
    v1 -> v2:
     - no need to check for thread existence after flipping the lock,
       pktgen threads are freed only at net exit time
     -

    neighbor: Call __ipv4_neigh_lookup_noref in neigh_xmit

    Commit cd9ff4de0107 changed the key for IFF_POINTOPOINT devices to
    INADDR_ANY but neigh_xmit which is used for MPLS encapsulations was not
    updated to use the altered key. The result is that every packet Tx does
    a lookup on the gateway address which does not find an entry, a new one
    is created only to find the existing one in the table right before the
    insert since arp_constructor was updated to reset the primary key. This
    is seen in the allocs and destroys counters:
        ip -s -4 ntable show | head -10 | grep alloc
    
    which increase for each packet showing the unnecessary overhread.
    
    Fix by having neigh_xmit use __ipv4_neigh_lookup_noref for NEIGH_ARP_TABLE.

    ethtool: fix potential userspace buffer overflow
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ee4e76937d69128a6a66861ba393ebdc2ffc8a2 ]
    
    ethtool_get_regs() allocates a buffer of size ops->get_regs_len(),
    and pass it to the kernel driver via ops->get_regs() for filling.
    
    There is no restriction about what the kernel drivers can or cannot do
    with the open ethtool_regs structure. They usually set regs->version
    and ignore regs->len or set it to the same size as ops->get_regs_len().
    
    But if userspace allocates a smaller buffer for the registers dump,
    we would cause a userspace buffer overflow in the final copy_to_user()
    call, which uses the regs.len value potentially reset by the driver.
    
    To fix this, make this case obvious and store regs.len before calling
    ops->get_regs(), to only copy as much data as requested by userspace,
    up to the value returned by ops->get_regs_len().
    
    While at it, remove the redundant check for non-null regbuf.

    userfaultfd: don't pin the user memory in userfaultfd_file_create()
    
    commit d2005e3f41d4f9299e2df6a967c8beb5086967a9 upstream.
    
    userfaultfd_file_create() increments mm->mm_users; this means that the
    memory won't be unmapped/freed if mm owner exits/execs, and UFFDIO_COPY
    after that can populate the orphaned mm more.
    
    Change userfaultfd_file_create() and userfaultfd_ctx_put() to use
    mm->mm_count to pin mm_struct.  This means that
    atomic_inc_not_zero(mm->mm_users) is needed when we are going to
    actually play with this memory.  Except handle_userfault() path doesn't
    need this, the caller must already have a reference.
    
    The patch adds the new trivial helper, mmget_not_zero(), it can have
    more users.

    brcmfmac: fix incorrect event channel deduction
    
    commit 8e290cecdd0178f3d4cf7d463c51dc7e462843b4 upstream.
    
    brcmf_sdio_fromevntchan() was being called on the the data frame
    rather than the software header, causing some frames to be
    mischaracterized as on the event channel rather than the data channel.
    
    This fixes a major performance regression (due to dropped packets). With
    this patch the download speed jumped from 1Mbit/s back up to 40MBit/s due
    to the sheer amount of packets being incorrectly processed.

    brcmfmac: revise handling events in receive path
    
    commit 9c349892ccc90c6de2baaa69cc78449f58082273 upstream.
    
    Move event handling out of brcmf_netif_rx() avoiding the need
    to pass a flag. This flag is only ever true for USB hosts as
    other interface use separate brcmf_rx_event() function.

    brcmfmac: screening firmware event packet
    
    commit c56caa9db8abbbfb9e31325e0897705aa897db37 upstream.
    
    Firmware uses asynchronized events as a communication method to the
    host. The event packets are marked as ETH_P_LINK_CTL protocol type. For
    SDIO and PCIe bus, this kind of packets are delivered through virtual
    event channel not data channel. This patch adds a screening logic to
    make sure the event handler only processes the events coming from the
    correct channel.

    kernel/signal.c: trace_signal_deliver when signal_group_exit
    
    commit 98af37d624ed8c83f1953b1b6b2f6866011fc064 upstream.
    
    In the fixes commit, removing SIGKILL from each thread signal mask and
    executing "goto fatal" directly will skip the call to
    "trace_signal_deliver".  At this point, the delivery tracking of the
    SIGKILL signal will be inaccurate.
    
    Therefore, we need to add trace_signal_deliver before "goto fatal" after
    executing sigdelset.
    
    Note: SEND_SIG_NOINFO matches the fact that SIGKILL doesn't have any info.

    memcg: make it work on sparse non-0-node systems
    
    commit 3e8589963773a5c23e2f1fe4bcad0e9a90b7f471 upstream.
    
    We have a single node system with node 0 disabled:
      Scanning NUMA topology in Northbridge 24
      Number of physical nodes 2
      Skipping disabled node 0
      Node 1 MemBase 0000000000000000 Limit 00000000fbff0000
      NODE_DATA(1) allocated [mem 0xfbfda000-0xfbfeffff]
    
    This causes crashes in memcg when system boots:
      BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000008
      #PF error: [normal kernel read fault]
    ...
      RIP: 0010:list_lru_add+0x94/0x170
    ...
      Call Trace:
       d_lru_add+0x44/0x50
       dput.part.34+0xfc/0x110
       __fput+0x108/0x230
       task_work_run+0x9f/0xc0
       exit_to_usermode_loop+0xf5/0x100
    
    It is reproducible as far as 4.12.  I did not try older kernels.  You have
    to have a new enough systemd, e.g.  241 (the reason is unknown -- was not
    investigated).  Cannot be reproduced with systemd 234.
    
    The system crashes because the size of lru array is never updated in
    memcg_update_all_list_lrus and the reads are past the zero-sized array,
    causing dereferences of random memory.
    
    The root cause are list_lru_memcg_aware checks in the list_lru code.  The
    test in list_lru_memcg_aware is broken: it assumes node 0 is always
    present, but it is not true on some systems as can be seen above.
    
    So fix this by avoiding checks on node 0.  Remember the memcg-awareness by
    a bool flag in struct list_lru.

    (crystal or clock generator at XIN). Set the ClockEn bit to 0 to disable
    clocking
      Bit 1: CrystalEnSet the CrystalEn bit high to enable the crystal
    oscillator. When using an external clock source at XIN, CrystalEn must
    be set low.
    
    The bit 4, MAX310X_CLKSRC_EXTCLK_BIT, should be set and was not.
    
    This was required to make the MAX3107 with an external crystal on our
    board able to send or receive data.

    drm/nouveau/i2c: Disable i2c bus access after ->fini()
    
    commit 342406e4fbba9a174125fbfe6aeac3d64ef90f76 upstream.
    
    For a while, we've had the problem of i2c bus access not grabbing
    a runtime PM ref when it's being used in userspace by i2c-dev, resulting
    in nouveau spamming the kernel log with errors if anything attempts to
    access the i2c bus while the GPU is in runtime suspend. An example:
    
    [  130.078386] nouveau 0000:01:00.0: i2c: aux 000d: begin idle timeout ffffffff
    
    Since the GPU is in runtime suspend, the MMIO region that the i2c bus is
    on isn't accessible. On x86, the standard behavior for accessing an
    unavailable MMIO region is to just return ~0.
    
    Except, that turned out to be a lie. While computers with a clean
    concious will return ~0 in this scenario, some machines will actually
    completely hang a CPU on certian bad MMIO accesses. This was witnessed
    with someone's Lenovo ThinkPad P50, where sensors-detect attempting to
    access the i2c bus while the GPU was suspended would result in a CPU
    hang:

      watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#5 stuck for 23s! [sensors-detect:12438]
    
    Yikes! While I wanted to try to make it so that accessing an i2c bus on
    nouveau would wake up the GPU as needed, airlied pointed out that pretty
    much any usecase for userspace accessing an i2c bus on a GPU (mainly for
    the DDC brightness control that some displays have) is going to only be
    useful while there's at least one display enabled on the GPU anyway, and
    the GPU never sleeps while there's displays running.
    
    Since teaching the i2c bus to wake up the GPU on userspace accesses is a
    good deal more difficult than it might seem, mostly due to the fact that
    we have to use the i2c bus during runtime resume of the GPU, we instead
    opt for the easiest solution: don't let userspace access i2c busses on
    the GPU at all while it's in runtime suspend.
    
    Changes since v1:
    * Also disable i2c busses that run over DP AUX

    I measured power consumption between power_save_node=1 and power_save_node=0.
    It's almost the same.
    Codec will enter to runtime suspend and suspend.
    That pin also will enter to D3. Don't need to enter to D3 by single pin.
    So, Disable power_save_node as default. It will avoid more issues.

    Btrfs: fix race updating log root item during fsync
    
    commit 06989c799f04810f6876900d4760c0edda369cf7 upstream.
    
    When syncing the log, the final phase of a fsync operation, we need to
    either create a log root's item or update the existing item in the log
    tree of log roots, and that depends on the current value of the log
    root's log_transid - if it's 1 we need to create the log root item,
    otherwise it must exist already and we update it. Since there is no
    synchronization between updating the log_transid and checking it for
    deciding whether the log root's item needs to be created or updated, we
    end up with a tiny race window that results in attempts to update the
    item to fail because the item was not yet created:
    
                  CPU 1                                    CPU 2
    
      btrfs_sync_log()
    
        lock root->log_mutex
    
        set log root's log_transid to 1
    
        unlock root->log_mutex
    
                                                   btrfs_sync_log()
    
                                                     lock root->log_mutex
    
                                                     sets log root's
                                                     log_transid to 2
    
                                                     unlock root->log_mutex
    
        update_log_root()
    
          sees log root's log_transid
          with a value of 2
    
            calls btrfs_update_root(),
            which fails with -EUCLEAN
            and causes transaction abort
    
    Until recently the race lead to a BUG_ON at btrfs_update_root(), but after
    the recent commit 7ac1e464c4d47 ("btrfs: Don't panic when we can't find a
    root key") we just abort the current transaction.

    scsi: zfcp: fix to prevent port_remove with pure auto scan LUNs (only sdevs)
    
    commit ef4021fe5fd77ced0323cede27979d80a56211ca upstream.
    
    When the user tries to remove a zfcp port via sysfs, we only rejected it if
    there are zfcp unit children under the port. With purely automatically
    scanned LUNs there are no zfcp units but only SCSI devices. In such cases,
    the port_remove erroneously continued. We close the port and this
    implicitly closes all LUNs under the port. The SCSI devices survive with
    their private zfcp_scsi_dev still holding a reference to the "removed"
    zfcp_port (still allocated but invisible in sysfs) [zfcp_get_port_by_wwpn
    in zfcp_scsi_slave_alloc]. This is not a problem as long as the fc_rport
    stays blocked. Once (auto) port scan brings back the removed port, we
    unblock its fc_rport again by design.  However, there is no mechanism that
    would recover (open) the LUNs under the port (no "ersfs_3" without
    zfcp_unit [zfcp_erp_strategy_followup_success]).  Any pending or new I/O to
    such LUN leads to repeated:
    
      Done: NEEDS_RETRY Result: hostbyte=DID_IMM_RETRY driverbyte=DRIVER_OK
    
    See also v4.10 commit 6f2ce1c6af37 ("scsi: zfcp: fix rport unblock race
    with LUN recovery"). Even a manual LUN recovery
    (echo 0 > /sys/bus/scsi/devices/H:C:T:L/zfcp_failed)
    does not help, as the LUN links to the old "removed" port which remains
    to lack ZFCP_STATUS_COMMON_RUNNING [zfcp_erp_required_act].
    The only workaround is to first ensure that the fc_rport is blocked
    (e.g. port_remove again in case it was re-discovered by (auto) port scan),
    then delete the SCSI devices, and finally re-discover by (auto) port scan.
    The port scan includes an fc_rport unblock, which in turn triggers
    a new scan on the scsi target to freshly get new pure auto scan LUNs.
    
    Fix this by rejecting port_remove also if there are SCSI devices
    (even without any zfcp_unit) under this port. Re-use mechanics from v3.7
    commit d99b601b6338 ("[SCSI] zfcp: restore refcount check on port_remove").
    However, we have to give up zfcp_sysfs_port_units_mutex earlier in unit_add
    to prevent a deadlock with scsi_host scan taking shost->scan_mutex first
    and then zfcp_sysfs_port_units_mutex now in our zfcp_scsi_slave_alloc().

    media: smsusb: better handle optional alignment
    
    commit a47686636d84eaec5c9c6e84bd5f96bed34d526d upstream.
    
    Most Siano devices require an alignment for the response.
    
    Changeset f3be52b0056a ("media: usb: siano: Fix general protection fault in smsusb")
    changed the logic with gets such aligment, but it now produces a
    sparce warning:
    
    drivers/media/usb/siano/smsusb.c: In function 'smsusb_init_device':

          |                             ~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    The sparse message itself is bogus, but a broken (or fake) USB
    eeprom could produce a negative value for response_alignment.
    
    So, change the code in order to check if the result is not
    negative.

    commit 31e0456de5be379b10fea0fa94a681057114a96e upstream.
    
    The syzkaller USB fuzzer found a general-protection-fault bug in the
    smsusb part of the Siano DVB driver.  The fault occurs during probe
    because the driver assumes without checking that the device has both
    IN and OUT endpoints and the IN endpoint is ep1.
    
    By slightly rearranging the driver's initialization code, we can make
    the appropriate checks early on and thus avoid the problem.  If the
    expected endpoints aren't present, the new code safely returns -ENODEV
    from the probe routine.

    USB: Add LPM quirk for Surface Dock GigE adapter
    
    commit ea261113385ac0a71c2838185f39e8452d54b152 upstream.
    
    Without USB_QUIRK_NO_LPM ethernet will not work and rtl8152 will
    complain with
    
        r8152 <device...>: Stop submitting intr, status -71
    
    Adding the quirk resolves this. As the dock is externally powered, this
    should not have any drawbacks.

    USB: Fix slab-out-of-bounds write in usb_get_bos_descriptor
    
    commit a03ff54460817c76105f81f3aa8ef655759ccc9a upstream.
    
    The syzkaller USB fuzzer found a slab-out-of-bounds write bug in the
    USB core, caused by a failure to check the actual size of a BOS
    descriptor.  This patch adds a check to make sure the descriptor is at
    least as large as it is supposed to be, so that the code doesn't
    inadvertently access memory beyond the end of the allocated region
    when assigning to dev->bos->desc->bNumDeviceCaps later on.

    Tracking this down shows that udev->bos is NULL in the following code:
    (xhci.c, in xhci_set_usb2_hardware_lpm)
            field = le32_to_cpu(udev->bos->ext_cap->bmAttributes);  <<<<<<< here
    
            xhci_dbg(xhci, "%s port %d USB2 hardware LPM\n",
                            enable ? "enable" : "disable", port_num + 1);
    
            if (enable) {
                    /* Host supports BESL timeout instead of HIRD */
                    if (udev->usb2_hw_lpm_besl_capable) {
                            /* if device doesn't have a preferred BESL value use a
                             * default one which works with mixed HIRD and BESL
                             * systems. See XHCI_DEFAULT_BESL definition in xhci.h
                             */
                            if ((field & USB_BESL_SUPPORT) &&
                                (field & USB_BESL_BASELINE_VALID))
                                    hird = USB_GET_BESL_BASELINE(field);
                            else
                                    hird = udev->l1_params.besl;
    
    The failing case is when disabling LPM. So it is sufficient to avoid
    access to udev->bos by moving the instruction into the "enable" clause.

    xhci: Convert xhci_handshake() to use readl_poll_timeout_atomic()
    
    commit f7fac17ca925faa03fc5eb854c081a24075f8bad upstream.
    
    Xhci_handshake() implements the algorithm already captured by
    readl_poll_timeout_atomic(). Convert the former to use the latter to
    avoid repetition.
    
    Turned out this patch also fixes a bug on the AMD Stoneyridge platform
    where usleep(1) sometimes takes over 10ms.
    This means a 5 second timeout can easily take over 15 seconds which will
    trigger the watchdog and reboot the system.

    include/linux/bitops.h: sanitize rotate primitives
    
    commit ef4d6f6b275c498f8e5626c99dbeefdc5027f843 upstream.
    
    The ror32 implementation (word >> shift) | (word << (32 - shift) has
    undefined behaviour if shift is outside the [1, 31] range.  Similarly
    for the 64 bit variants.  Most callers pass a compile-time constant
    (naturally in that range), but there's an UBSAN report that these may
    actually be called with a shift count of 0.
    
    Instead of special-casing that, we can make them DTRT for all values of
    shift while also avoiding UB.  For some reason, this was already partly
    done for rol32 (which was well-defined for [0, 31]).  gcc 8 recognizes
    these patterns as rotates, so for example
    
      __u32 rol32(__u32 word, unsigned int shift)
      {
            return (word << (shift & 31)) | (word >> ((-shift) & 31));
      }
    
    compiles to
    
    0000000000000020 <rol32>:
      20:   89 f8                   mov    %edi,%eax
      22:   89 f1                   mov    %esi,%ecx
      24:   d3 c0                   rol    %cl,%eax
      26:   c3                      retq
    
    Older compilers unfortunately do not do as well, but this only affects
    the small minority of users that don't pass constants.
    
    Due to integer promotions, ro[lr]8 were already well-defined for shifts
    in [0, 8], and ro[lr]16 were mostly well-defined for shifts in [0, 16]
    (only mostly - u16 gets promoted to _signed_ int, so if bit 15 is set,
    word << 16 is undefined).  For consistency, update those as well.

    Previously, %g2 would end up with the value PAGE_SIZE, but after the
    commit mentioned below it ends up with the value 1 due to being reused
    for a different purpose. We need it to be PAGE_SIZE as we use it to step
    through pages in our demap loop, otherwise we set different flags in the
    low 12 bits of the address written to, thereby doing things other than a
    nucleus page flush.

    tipc: fix modprobe tipc failed after switch order of device registration -v2
    
    commit 526f5b851a96566803ee4bee60d0a34df56c77f8 upstream.
    
    Error message printed:
    modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'tipc': Address family not
    supported by protocol.
    when modprobe tipc after the following patch: switch order of
    device registration, commit 7e27e8d6130c
    ("tipc: switch order of device registration to fix a crash")
    
    Because sock_create_kern(net, AF_TIPC, ...) called by
    tipc_topsrv_create_listener() in the initialization process
    of tipc_init_net(), so tipc_socket_init() must be execute before that.
    Meanwhile, tipc_net_id need to be initialized when sock_create()
    called, and tipc_socket_init() is no need to be called for each namespace.
    
    I add a variable tipc_topsrv_net_ops, and split the
    register_pernet_subsys() of tipc into two parts, and split
    tipc_socket_init() with initialization of pernet params.
    
    By the way, I fixed resources rollback error when tipc_bcast_init()
    failed in tipc_init_net().

    xen/pciback: Don't disable PCI_COMMAND on PCI device reset.
    
    commit 7681f31ec9cdacab4fd10570be924f2cef6669ba upstream.
    
    There is no need for this at all. Worst it means that if
    the guest tries to write to BARs it could lead (on certain
    platforms) to PCI SERR errors.
    
    Please note that with af6fc858a35b90e89ea7a7ee58e66628c55c776b
    "xen-pciback: limit guest control of command register"
    a guest is still allowed to enable those control bits (safely), but
    is not allowed to disable them and that therefore a well behaved
    frontend which enables things before using them will still
    function correctly.
    
    This is done via an write to the configuration register 0x4 which
    triggers on the backend side:
    command_write
      \- pci_enable_device
         \- pci_enable_device_flags
            \- do_pci_enable_device
               \- pcibios_enable_device
                  \-pci_enable_resourcess
                    [which enables the PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY|PCI_COMMAND_IO]
    
    However guests (and drivers) which don't do this could cause
    problems, including the security issues which XSA-120 sought
    to address.

    crypto: vmx - ghash: do nosimd fallback manually
    
    commit 357d065a44cdd77ed5ff35155a989f2a763e96ef upstream.
    
    VMX ghash was using a fallback that did not support interleaving simd
    and nosimd operations, leading to failures in the extended test suite.
    
    If I understood correctly, Eric's suggestion was to use the same
    data format that the generic code uses, allowing us to call into it
    with the same contexts. I wasn't able to get that to work - I think
    there's a very different key structure and data layout being used.
    
    So instead steal the arm64 approach and perform the fallback
    operations directly if required.

    net: mvpp2: fix bad MVPP2_TXQ_SCHED_TOKEN_CNTR_REG queue value
    
    [ Upstream commit 21808437214637952b61beaba6034d97880fbeb3 ]
    
    MVPP2_TXQ_SCHED_TOKEN_CNTR_REG() expects the logical queue id but
    the current code is passing the global tx queue offset, so it ends
    up writing to unknown registers (between 0x8280 and 0x82fc, which
    seemed to be unused by the hardware). This fixes the issue by using
    the logical queue id instead.

    bnxt_en: Fix aggregation buffer leak under OOM condition.
    
    [ Upstream commit 296d5b54163964b7ae536b8b57dfbd21d4e868e1 ]
    
    For every RX packet, the driver replenishes all buffers used for that
    packet and puts them back into the RX ring and RX aggregation ring.
    In one code path where the RX packet has one RX buffer and one or more
    aggregation buffers, we missed recycling the aggregation buffer(s) if
    we are unable to allocate a new SKB buffer.  This leads to the
    aggregation ring slowly running out of buffers over time.  Fix it
    by properly recycling the aggregation buffers.

    tipc: Avoid copying bytes beyond the supplied data
    
    TLV_SET is called with a data pointer and a len parameter that tells us
    how many bytes are pointed to by data. When invoking memcpy() we need
    to careful to only copy len bytes.
    
    Previously we would copy TLV_LENGTH(len) bytes which would copy an extra
    4 bytes past the end of the data pointer which newer GCC versions
    complain about.
    
     In file included from test.c:17:
     In function 'TLV_SET',
         inlined from 'test' at test.c:186:5:
     /usr/include/linux/tipc_config.h:317:3:
     warning: 'memcpy' forming offset [33, 36] is out of the bounds [0, 32]
     of object 'bearer_name' with type 'char[32]' [-Warray-bounds]

              ^~~~~~~~~~~
    
    We still want to ensure any padding bytes at the end are initialised, do
    this with a explicit memset() rather than copy bytes past the end of
    data. Apply the same logic to TCM_SET.

    The crash happens roughly 125..130ms after the disconnect. This
    correlates with the 'delay' timer that is started on certain USB tx/rx
    errors in the URB completion handler.
    
    The problem is a race of usbnet_stop() with usbnet_start_xmit(). In
    usbnet_stop() we call usbnet_terminate_urbs() to cancel all URBs in
    flight. This only makes sense if no new URBs are submitted
    concurrently, though. But the usbnet_start_xmit() can run at the same
    time on another CPU which almost unconditionally submits an URB. The
    error callback of the new URB will then schedule the timer after it was
    already stopped.
    
    The fix adds a check if the tx queue is stopped after the tx list lock
    has been taken. This should reliably prevent the submission of new URBs
    while usbnet_terminate_urbs() does its job. The same thing is done on
    the rx side even though it might be safe due to other flags that are
    checked there.

    net-gro: fix use-after-free read in napi_gro_frags()
    
    [ Upstream commit a4270d6795b0580287453ea55974d948393e66ef ]
    
    If a network driver provides to napi_gro_frags() an
    skb with a page fragment of exactly 14 bytes, the call
    to gro_pull_from_frag0() will 'consume' the fragment
    by calling skb_frag_unref(skb, 0), and the page might
    be freed and reused.
    
    Reading eth->h_proto at the end of napi_frags_skb() might
    read mangled data, or crash under specific debugging features.

    [ Upstream commit 72f7cfab6f93a8ea825fab8ccfb016d064269f7f ]
    
    IPv6 does not consider if the socket is bound to a device when binding
    to an address. The result is that a socket can be bound to eth0 and
    then bound to the address of eth1. If the device is a VRF, the result
    is that a socket can only be bound to an address in the default VRF.
    
    Resolve by considering the device if sk_bound_dev_if is set.

    ASoC: davinci-mcasp: Fix clang warning without CONFIG_PM
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ca5104715cfd14254ea5aecc390ae583b707607 ]
    
    Building with clang shows a variable that is only used by the
    suspend/resume functions but defined outside of their #ifdef block:
    
    sound/soc/ti/davinci-mcasp.c:48:12: error: variable 'context_regs' is not needed and will not be emitted
    
    We commonly fix these by marking the PM functions as __maybe_unused,
    but here that would grow the davinci_mcasp structure, so instead
    add another #ifdef here.

    spi: Fix zero length xfer bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 5442dcaa0d90fc376bdfc179a018931a8f43dea4 ]
    
    This fixes a bug for messages containing both zero length and
    unidirectional xfers.
    
    The function spi_map_msg will allocate dummy tx and/or rx buffers
    for use with unidirectional transfers when the hardware can only do
    a bidirectional transfer.  That dummy buffer will be used in place
    of a NULL buffer even when the xfer length is 0.
    
    Then in the function __spi_map_msg, if he hardware can dma,
    the zero length xfer will have spi_map_buf called on the dummy
    buffer.
    
    Eventually, __sg_alloc_table is called and returns -EINVAL
    because nents == 0.
    
    This fix prevents the error by not using the dummy buffer when
    the xfer length is zero.

    [ Upstream commit 03aa4f191a36f33fce015387f84efa0eee94408e ]
    
    Two saa7146/hexium files contain a construct that causes a warning
    when built with clang:
    
    drivers/media/pci/saa7146/hexium_orion.c:210:12: error: stack frame size of 2272 bytes in function 'hexium_probe'
          [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=]

    static int hexium_attach(struct saa7146_dev *dev, struct saa7146_pci_extension_data *info)
               ^
    
    This one happens regardless of KASAN, and the problem is that a
    constructor to initialize a dynamically allocated structure leads
    to a copy of that structure on the stack, whereas gcc initializes
    it in place.

    rcutorture: Fix cleanup path for invalid torture_type strings
    
    [ Upstream commit b813afae7ab6a5e91b4e16cc567331d9c2ae1f04 ]
    
    If the specified rcutorture.torture_type is not in the rcu_torture_init()
    function's torture_ops[] array, rcutorture prints some console messages
    and then invokes rcu_torture_cleanup() to set state so that a future
    torture test can run.  However, rcu_torture_cleanup() also attempts to
    end the test that didn't actually start, and in doing so relies on the
    value of cur_ops, a value that is not particularly relevant in this case.
    This can result in confusing output or even follow-on failures due to
    attempts to use facilities that have not been properly initialized.
    
    This commit therefore sets the value of cur_ops to NULL in this case
    and inserts a check near the beginning of rcu_torture_cleanup(),
    thus avoiding relying on an irrelevant cur_ops value.

    Smatch marks skb->data as untrusted so it warns that "evt_hdr->dlen"
    can copy up to 255 bytes and we only have room for two bytes.  Even
    if this comes from the firmware and we trust it, the new policy
    generally is just to fix it as kernel hardenning.
    
    I can't test this code so I tried to be very conservative.  I considered
    not allowing "evt_hdr->dlen == 1" because it doesn't initialize the
    whole variable but in the end I decided to allow it and manually
    initialized "asic_id" and "asic_ver" to zero.

    cxgb3/l2t: Fix undefined behaviour
    
    [ Upstream commit 76497732932f15e7323dc805e8ea8dc11bb587cf ]
    
    The use of zero-sized array causes undefined behaviour when it is not
    the last member in a structure. As it happens to be in this case.
    
    Also, the current code makes use of a language extension to the C90
    standard, but the preferred mechanism to declare variable-length
    types such as this one is a flexible array member, introduced in
    C99:
    
    struct foo {
            int stuff;
            struct boo array[];
    };
    
    By making use of the mechanism above, we will get a compiler warning
    in case the flexible array does not occur last. Which is beneficial
    to cultivate a high-quality code.

    HID: core: move Usage Page concatenation to Main item
    
    [ Upstream commit 58e75155009cc800005629955d3482f36a1e0eec ]
    
    As seen on some USB wireless keyboards manufactured by Primax, the HID
    parser was using some assumptions that are not always true. In this case
    it's s the fact that, inside the scope of a main item, an Usage Page
    will always precede an Usage.
    
    The spec is not pretty clear as 6.2.2.7 states "Any usage that follows
    is interpreted as a Usage ID and concatenated with the Usage Page".
    While 6.2.2.8 states "When the parser encounters a main item it
    concatenates the last declared Usage Page with a Usage to form a
    complete usage value." Being somewhat contradictory it was decided to
    match Window's implementation, which follows 6.2.2.8.
    
    In summary, the patch moves the Usage Page concatenation from the local
    item parsing function to the main item parsing function.

    scsi: ufs: Avoid configuring regulator with undefined voltage range
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b141e8cfd54ba3e5c610717295b2a02aab26a05 ]
    
    For regulators used by UFS, vcc, vccq and vccq2 will have voltage range
    initialized by ufshcd_populate_vreg(), however other regulators may have
    undefined voltage range if dt-bindings have no such definition.
    
    In above undefined case, both "min_uV" and "max_uV" fields in ufs_vreg
    struct will be zero values and these values will be configured on
    regulators in different power modes.
    
    Currently this may have no harm if both "min_uV" and "max_uV" always keep
    "zero values" because regulator_set_voltage() will always bypass such
    invalid values and return "good" results.
    
    However improper values shall be fixed to avoid potential bugs.  Simply
    bypass voltage configuration if voltage range is not defined.

    scsi: ufs: Fix regulator load and icc-level configuration
    
    [ Upstream commit 0487fff76632ec023d394a05b82e87a971db8c03 ]
    
    Currently if a regulator has "<name>-fixed-regulator" property in device
    tree, it will skip current limit initialization.  This lead to a zero
    "max_uA" value in struct ufs_vreg.
    
    However, "regulator_set_load" operation shall be required on regulators
    which have valid current limits, otherwise a zero "max_uA" set by
    "regulator_set_load" may cause unexpected behavior when this regulator is
    enabled or set as high power mode.
    
    Similarly, in device's icc_level configuration flow, the target icc_level
    shall be updated if regulator also has valid current limit, otherwise a
    wrong icc_level will be calculated by zero "max_uA" and thus causes
    unexpected results after it is written to device.

    connect (before full initialization completes) usb_hub_wq would wait
    forever for the dev_init_lock to be unlocked. dev_init_lock would remain
    locked though because of infinite wait during usb_kill_urb:

    It was traced down to a case where usb_kill_urb would be called on an URB
    structure containing more or less random data, including large number in
    its use_count. During the debugging it appeared that in brcmf_usb_free_q()
    the traversal over URBs' lists is not synchronized with operations on those
    lists in brcmf_usb_rx_complete() leading to handling
    brcmf_usbdev_info structure (holding lists' head) as lists' element and in
    result causing above problem.
    
    Fix it by walking through all URBs during brcmf_cancel_all_urbs using the
    arrays of requests instead of linked lists.

    b43: shut up clang -Wuninitialized variable warning
    
    [ Upstream commit d825db346270dbceef83b7b750dbc29f1d7dcc0e ]
    
    Clang warns about what is clearly a case of passing an uninitalized
    variable into a static function:
    
    drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/b43/phy_lp.c:1852:23: error: variable 'gains' is uninitialized when used here
          [-Werror,-Wuninitialized]
                    lpphy_papd_cal(dev, gains, 0, 1, 30);
                                        ^~~~~
    drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/b43/phy_lp.c:1838:2: note: variable 'gains' is declared here
            struct lpphy_tx_gains gains, oldgains;
            ^
    1 error generated.
    
    However, this function is empty, and its arguments are never evaluated,
    so gcc in contrast does not warn here. Both compilers behave in a
    reasonable way as far as I can tell, so we should change the code
    to avoid the warning everywhere.
    
    We could just eliminate the lpphy_papd_cal() function entirely,
    given that it has had the TODO comment in it for 10 years now
    and is rather unlikely to ever get done. I'm doing a simpler
    change here, and just pass the 'oldgains' variable in that has
    been initialized, based on the guess that this is what was
    originally meant.

    iio: common: ssp_sensors: Initialize calculated_time in ssp_common_process_data
    
    [ Upstream commit 6f9ca1d3eb74b81f811a87002de2d51640d135b1 ]
    
    When building with -Wsometimes-uninitialized, Clang warns:
    
    drivers/iio/common/ssp_sensors/ssp_iio.c:95:6: warning: variable
    'calculated_time' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false
    [-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
    
    While it isn't wrong, this will never be a problem because
    iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp only uses calculated_time
    on the same condition that it is assigned (when scan_timestamp
    is not zero). While iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp is marked
    as inline, Clang does inlining in the optimization stage, which
    happens after the semantic analysis phase (plus inline is merely
    a hint to the compiler).
    
    Fix this by just zero initializing calculated_time.

    iio: ad_sigma_delta: Properly handle SPI bus locking vs CS assertion
    
    [ Upstream commit df1d80aee963480c5c2938c64ec0ac3e4a0df2e0 ]
    
    For devices from the SigmaDelta family we need to keep CS low when doing a
    conversion, since the device will use the MISO line as a interrupt to
    indicate that the conversion is complete.
    
    This is why the driver locks the SPI bus and when the SPI bus is locked
    keeps as long as a conversion is going on. The current implementation gets
    one small detail wrong though. CS is only de-asserted after the SPI bus is
    unlocked. This means it is possible for a different SPI device on the same
    bus to send a message which would be wrongfully be addressed to the
    SigmaDelta device as well. Make sure that the last SPI transfer that is
    done while holding the SPI bus lock de-asserts the CS signal.

    x86/build: Keep local relocations with ld.lld
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c21383f3429dd70da39c0c7f1efa12377a47ab6 ]
    
    The LLVM linker (ld.lld) defaults to removing local relocations, which
    causes KASLR boot failures. ld.bfd and ld.gold already handle this
    correctly. This adds the explicit instruction "--discard-none" during
    the link phase. There is no change in output for ld.bfd and ld.gold,
    but ld.lld now produces an image with all the needed relocations.

    extcon: arizona: Disable mic detect if running when driver is removed
    
    [ Upstream commit 00053de52231117ddc154042549f2256183ffb86 ]
    
    Microphone detection provides the button detection features on the
    Arizona CODECs as such it will be running if the jack is currently
    inserted. If the driver is unbound whilst the jack is still inserted
    this will cause warnings from the regulator framework as the MICVDD
    regulator is put but was never disabled.
    
    Correct this by disabling microphone detection on driver removal and if

    PM / core: Propagate dev->power.wakeup_path when no callbacks
    
    [ Upstream commit dc351d4c5f4fe4d0f274d6d660227be0c3a03317 ]
    
    The dev->power.direct_complete flag may become set in device_prepare() in
    case the device don't have any PM callbacks (dev->power.no_pm_callbacks is
    set). This leads to a broken behaviour, when there is child having wakeup
    enabled and relies on its parent to be used in the wakeup path.
    
    More precisely, when the direct complete path becomes selected for the
    child in __device_suspend(), the propagation of the dev->power.wakeup_path
    becomes skipped as well.
    
    Let's address this problem, by checking if the device is a part the wakeup
    path or has wakeup enabled, then prevent the direct complete path from
    being used.

    mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: add erratum eSDHC-A001 and A-008358 support
    
    [ Upstream commit 05cb6b2a66fa7837211a060878e91be5eb10cb07 ]
    
    eSDHC-A001: The data timeout counter (SYSCTL[DTOCV]) is not
    reliable for DTOCV values 0x4(2^17 SD clock), 0x8(2^21 SD clock),
    and 0xC(2^25 SD clock). The data timeout counter can count from
    2^13–2^27, but for values 2^17, 2^21, and 2^25, the timeout
    counter counts for only 2^13 SD clocks.
    A-008358: The data timeout counter value loaded into the timeout
    counter is less than expected and can result into early timeout
    error in case of eSDHC data transactions. The table below shows
    the expected vs actual timeout period for different values of
    SYSCTL[DTOCV]:
    these two erratum has the same quirk to control it, and set
    SDHCI_QUIRK_RESET_AFTER_REQUEST to fix above issue.

    scsi: libsas: Do discovery on empty PHY to update PHY info
    
    [ Upstream commit d8649fc1c5e40e691d589ed825998c36a947491c ]
    
    When we discover the PHY is empty in sas_rediscover_dev(), the PHY
    information (like negotiated linkrate) is not updated.
    
    As such, for a user examining sysfs for that PHY, they would see
    incorrect values:
    
    root@(none)$ cd /sys/class/sas_phy/phy-0:0:20
    root@(none)$ more negotiated_linkrate
    3.0 Gbit
    root@(none)$ echo 0 > enable
    root@(none)$ more negotiated_linkrate
    3.0 Gbit
    
    So fix this, simply discover the PHY again, even though we know it's empty;
    in the above example, this gives us:
    
    root@(none)$ more negotiated_linkrate
    Phy disabled
    
    We must do this after unregistering the device associated with the PHY
    (in sas_unregister_devs_sas_addr()).

    Commit
    
      37fe6a42b343 ("x86: Check stack overflow in detail")
    
    added a broad check for the full exception stack area, i.e. it considers
    the full exception stack area as valid.
    
    That's wrong in two aspects:
    
     1) It does not check the individual areas one by one
    
     2) #DF, NMI and #MCE are not enabling interrupts which means that a
        regular device interrupt cannot happen in their context. In fact if a
        device interrupt hits one of those IST stacks that's a bug because some
        code path enabled interrupts while handling the exception.
    
    Limit the check to the #DB stack and consider all other IST stacks as
    'overflow' or invalid.

    USB: core: Don't unbind interfaces following device reset failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 381419fa720060ba48b7bbc483be787d5b1dca6f ]
    
    The SCSI core does not like to have devices or hosts unregistered
    while error recovery is in progress.  Trying to do so can lead to
    self-deadlock: Part of the removal code tries to obtain a lock already
    held by the error handler.
    
    This can cause problems for the usb-storage and uas drivers, because
    their error handler routines perform a USB reset, and if the reset
    fails then the USB core automatically goes on to unbind all drivers
    from the device's interfaces -- all while still in the context of the
    SCSI error handler.
    
    As it turns out, practically all the scenarios leading to a USB reset
    failure end up causing a device disconnect (the main error pathway in
    usb_reset_and_verify_device(), at the end of the routine, calls
    hub_port_logical_disconnect() before returning).  As a result, the
    hub_wq thread will soon become aware of the problem and will unbind
    all the device's drivers in its own context, not in the
    error-handler's context.
    
    This means that usb_reset_device() does not need to call
    usb_unbind_and_rebind_marked_interfaces() in cases where
    usb_reset_and_verify_device() has returned an error, because hub_wq
    will take care of everything anyway.
    
    This particular problem was observed in somewhat artificial
    circumstances, by using usbfs to tell a hub to power-down a port
    connected to a USB-3 mass storage device using the UAS protocol.  With
    the port turned off, the currently executing command timed out and the
    error handler started running.  The USB reset naturally failed,
    because the hub port was off, and the error handler deadlocked as
    described above.  Not carrying out the call to
    usb_unbind_and_rebind_marked_interfaces() fixes this issue.

    powerpc/numa: improve control of topology updates
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d4d9b308f8f8dec68f6dbbff18c68ec7c6bd26f ]
    
    When booted with "topology_updates=no", or when "off" is written to
    /proc/powerpc/topology_updates, NUMA reassignments are inhibited for
    PRRN and VPHN events. However, migration and suspend unconditionally
    re-enable reassignments via start_topology_update(). This is
    incoherent.
    
    Check the topology_updates_enabled flag in
    start/stop_topology_update() so that callers of those APIs need not be
    aware of whether reassignments are enabled. This allows the
    administrative decision on reassignments to remain in force across
    migrations and suspensions.

    media: pvrusb2: Prevent a buffer overflow
    
    [ Upstream commit c1ced46c7b49ad7bc064e68d966e0ad303f917fb ]
    
    The ctrl_check_input() function is called from pvr2_ctrl_range_check().
    It's supposed to validate user supplied input and return true or false
    depending on whether the input is valid or not.  The problem is that
    negative shifts or shifts greater than 31 are undefined in C.  In
    practice with GCC they result in shift wrapping so this function returns
    true for some inputs which are not valid and this could result in a
    buffer overflow:
    
        drivers/media/usb/pvrusb2/pvrusb2-ctrl.c:205 pvr2_ctrl_get_valname()
        warn: uncapped user index 'names[val]'
    
    The cptr->hdw->input_allowed_mask mask is configured in pvr2_hdw_create()
    and the highest valid bit is BIT(4).

    media: au0828: Fix NULL pointer dereference in au0828_analog_stream_enable()
    
    [ Upstream commit 898bc40bfcc26abb6e06e960d6d4754c36c58b50 ]
    
    Fix au0828_analog_stream_enable() to check if device is in the right
    state first. When unbind happens while bind is in progress, usbdev
    pointer could be invalid in au0828_analog_stream_enable() and a call
    to usb_ifnum_to_if() will result in the null pointer dereference.
    
    This problem is found with the new media_dev_allocator.sh test.

    audit: fix a memory leak bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 70c4cf17e445264453bc5323db3e50aa0ac9e81f ]
    
    In audit_rule_change(), audit_data_to_entry() is firstly invoked to
    translate the payload data to the kernel's rule representation. In
    audit_data_to_entry(), depending on the audit field type, an audit tree may
    be created in audit_make_tree(), which eventually invokes kmalloc() to
    allocate the tree.  Since this tree is a temporary tree, it will be then
    freed in the following execution, e.g., audit_add_rule() if the message
    type is AUDIT_ADD_RULE or audit_del_rule() if the message type is
    AUDIT_DEL_RULE. However, if the message type is neither AUDIT_ADD_RULE nor
    AUDIT_DEL_RULE, i.e., the default case of the switch statement, this
    temporary tree is not freed.
    
    To fix this issue, only allocate the tree when the type is AUDIT_ADD_RULE
    or AUDIT_DEL_RULE.

    media: ov2659: make S_FMT succeed even if requested format doesn't match
    
    [ Upstream commit bccb89cf9cd07a0690d519696a00c00a973b3fe4 ]
    
    This driver returns an error if unsupported media bus pixel code is
    requested by VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT.
    
    But according to Documentation/media/uapi/v4l/vidioc-subdev-g-fmt.rst,
    
    Drivers must not return an error solely because the requested format
    doesn't match the device capabilities. They must instead modify the
    format to match what the hardware can provide.
    
    So select default format code and return success in that case.
    
    This is detected by v4l2-compliance.

    If the application was streaming from both videoX and vbiX, and streaming
    from videoX was stopped, then the vbi streaming also stopped.
    
    The cause being that stop_streaming for video stopped the subdevs as well,
    instead of only doing that if dev->streaming_users reached 0.
    
    au0828_stop_vbi_streaming was also wrong since it didn't stop the subdevs

    HID: logitech-hidpp: use RAP instead of FAP to get the protocol version
    
    [ Upstream commit 096377525cdb8251e4656085efc988bdf733fb4c ]
    
    According to the logitech_hidpp_2.0_specification_draft_2012-06-04.pdf doc:
    https://lekensteyn.nl/files/logitech/logitech_hidpp_2.0_specification_draft_2012-06-04.pdf
    
    We should use a register-access-protocol request using the short input /
    output report ids. This is necessary because 27MHz HID++ receivers have
    a max-packetsize on their HIP++ endpoint of 8, so they cannot support
    long reports. Using a feature-access-protocol request (which is always
    long or very-long) with these will cause a timeout error, followed by
    the hidpp driver treating the device as not being HID++ capable.
    
    This commit fixes this by switching to using a rap request to get the
    protocol version.
    
    Besides being tested with a (046d:c517) 27MHz receiver with various
    27MHz keyboards and mice, this has also been tested to not cause
    regressions on a non-unifying dual-HID++ nano receiver (046d:c534) with
    k270 and m185 HID++-2.0 devices connected and on a unifying/dj receiver
    (046d:c52b) with a HID++-2.0 Logitech Rechargeable Touchpad T650.

    [ Upstream commit 29da93fea3ea39ab9b12270cc6be1b70ef201c9e ]
    
    Randy reported objtool triggered on his (GCC-7.4) build:
    
      lib/strncpy_from_user.o: warning: objtool: strncpy_from_user()+0x315: call to __ubsan_handle_add_overflow() with UACCESS enabled
      lib/strnlen_user.o: warning: objtool: strnlen_user()+0x337: call to __ubsan_handle_sub_overflow() with UACCESS enabled
    
    This is due to UBSAN generating signed-overflow-UB warnings where it
    should not. Prior to GCC-8 UBSAN ignored -fwrapv (which the kernel
    uses through -fno-strict-overflow).
    
    Make the functions use 'unsigned long' throughout.

    x86/mm: Remove in_nmi() warning from 64-bit implementation of vmalloc_fault()
    
    [ Upstream commit a65c88e16f32aa9ef2e8caa68ea5c29bd5eb0ff0 ]
    
    In-NMI warnings have been added to vmalloc_fault() via:
    
      ebc8827f75 ("x86: Barf when vmalloc and kmemcheck faults happen in NMI")
    
    back in the time when our NMI entry code could not cope with nested NMIs.
    
    These days, it's perfectly fine to take a fault in NMI context and we
    don't have to care about the fact that IRET from the fault handler might
    cause NMI nesting.
    
    This warning has already been removed from 32-bit implementation of
    vmalloc_fault() in:
    
      6863ea0cda8 ("x86/mm: Remove in_nmi() warning from vmalloc_fault()")
    
    but the 64-bit version was omitted.
    
    Remove the bogus warning also from 64-bit implementation of vmalloc_fault().

    smpboot: Place the __percpu annotation correctly
    
    [ Upstream commit d4645d30b50d1691c26ff0f8fa4e718b08f8d3bb ]
    
    The test robot reported a wrong assignment of a per-CPU variable which
    it detected by using sparse and sent a report. The assignment itself is
    correct. The annotation for sparse was wrong and hence the report.
    The first pointer is a "normal" pointer and points to the per-CPU memory
    area. That means that the __percpu annotation has to be moved.
    
    Move the __percpu annotation to pointer which points to the per-CPU
    area. This change affects only the sparse tool (and is ignored by the
    compiler).

    x86/build: Move _etext to actual end of .text
    
    [ Upstream commit 392bef709659abea614abfe53cf228e7a59876a4 ]
    
    When building x86 with Clang LTO and CFI, CFI jump regions are
    automatically added to the end of the .text section late in linking. As a
    result, the _etext position was being labelled before the appended jump
    regions, causing confusion about where the boundaries of the executable
    region actually are in the running kernel, and broke at least the fault
    injection code. This moves the _etext mark to outside (and immediately
    after) the .text area, as it already the case on other architectures
    (e.g. arm64, arm).

    This cannot happen in practice because we only enter the loop
    if there is at least one element in the list.
    
    Slightly rearranging the code makes this clearer to both the
    reader and the compiler, which avoids the warning.

    bcache: add failure check to run_cache_set() for journal replay
    
    [ Upstream commit ce3e4cfb59cb382f8e5ce359238aa580d4ae7778 ]
    
    Currently run_cache_set() has no return value, if there is failure in
    bch_journal_replay(), the caller of run_cache_set() has no idea about
    such failure and just continue to execute following code after
    run_cache_set().  The internal failure is triggered inside
    bch_journal_replay() and being handled in async way. This behavior is
    inefficient, while failure handling inside bch_journal_replay(), cache
    register code is still running to start the cache set. Registering and
    unregistering code running as same time may introduce some rare race
    condition, and make the code to be more hard to be understood.
    
    This patch adds return value to run_cache_set(), and returns -EIO if
    bch_journal_rreplay() fails. Then caller of run_cache_set() may detect
    such failure and stop registering code flow immedidately inside
    register_cache_set().
    
    If journal replay fails, run_cache_set() can report error immediately
    to register_cache_set(). This patch makes the failure handling for
    bch_journal_replay() be in synchronized way, easier to understand and
    debug, and avoid poetential race condition for register-and-unregister
    in same time.

    bcache: fix failure in journal relplay
    
    [ Upstream commit 631207314d88e9091be02fbdd1fdadb1ae2ed79a ]
    
    journal replay failed with messages:
    Sep 10 19:10:43 ceph kernel: bcache: error on
    bb379a64-e44e-4812-b91d-a5599871a3b1: bcache: journal entries
    2057493-2057567 missing! (replaying 2057493-2076601), disabling
    caching
    
    The reason is in journal_reclaim(), when discard is enabled, we send
    discard command and reclaim those journal buckets whose seq is old
    than the last_seq_now, but before we write a journal with last_seq_now,
    the machine is restarted, so the journal with the last_seq_now is not
    written to the journal bucket, and the last_seq_wrote in the newest
    journal is old than last_seq_now which we expect to be, so when we doing
    replay, journals from last_seq_wrote to last_seq_now are missing.
    
    It's hard to write a journal immediately after journal_reclaim(),
    and it harmless if those missed journal are caused by discarding
    since those journals are already wrote to btree node. So, if miss
    seqs are started from the beginning journal, we treat it as normal,
    and only print a message to show the miss journal, and point out
    it maybe caused by discarding.
    
    Patch v2 add a judgement condition to ignore the missed journal
    only when discard enabled as Coly suggested.

    bcache: return error immediately in bch_journal_replay()
    
    [ Upstream commit 68d10e6979a3b59e3cd2e90bfcafed79c4cf180a ]
    
    When failure happens inside bch_journal_replay(), calling
    cache_set_err_on() and handling the failure in async way is not a good
    idea. Because after bch_journal_replay() returns, registering code will
    continue to execute following steps, and unregistering code triggered
    by cache_set_err_on() is running in same time. First it is unnecessary
    to handle failure and unregister cache set in an async way, second there
    might be potential race condition to run register and unregister code
    for same cache set.
    
    So in this patch, if failure happens in bch_journal_replay(), we don't
    call cache_set_err_on(), and just print out the same error message to
    kernel message buffer, then return -EIO immediately caller. Then caller
    can detect such failure and handle it in synchrnozied way.

    skb->data[] and it is a u8 so it's in the 0-255 range.  We need to cap

    mac80211/cfg80211: update bss channel on channel switch
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dc8cdce1d722c733f8c7af14c5fb595cfedbfa8 ]
    
    FullMAC STAs have no way to update bss channel after CSA channel switch
    completion. As a result, user-space tools may provide inconsistent
    channel info. For instance, consider the following two commands:
    $ sudo iw dev wlan0 link
    $ sudo iw dev wlan0 info
    The latter command gets channel info from the hardware, so most probably
    its output will be correct. However the former command gets channel info
    from scan cache, so its output will contain outdated channel info.
    In fact, current bss channel info will not be updated until the
    next [re-]connect.
    
    Note that mac80211 STAs have a workaround for this, but it requires
    access to internal cfg80211 data, see ieee80211_chswitch_work:
    
            /* XXX: shouldn't really modify cfg80211-owned data! */
            ifmgd->associated->channel = sdata->csa_chandef.chan;
    
    This patch suggests to convert mac80211 workaround into cfg80211 behavior
    and to update current bss channel in cfg80211_ch_switch_notify.

    dmaengine: pl330: _stop: clear interrupt status
    
    [ Upstream commit 2da254cc7908105a60a6bb219d18e8dced03dcb9 ]
    
    This patch kill instructs the DMAC to immediately terminate
    execution of a thread. and then clear the interrupt status,
    at last, stop generating interrupts for DMA_SEV. to guarantee
    the next dma start is clean. otherwise, one interrupt maybe leave
    to next start and make some mistake.
    
    we can reporduce the problem as follows:
    
    DMASEV: modify the event-interrupt resource, and if the INTEN sets
    function as interrupt, the DMAC will set irq<event_num> HIGH to
    generate interrupt. write INTCLR to clear interrupt.
    
            DMA EXECUTING INSTRUCTS         DMA TERMINATE
                    |                               |
                    |                               |
                   ...                            _stop
                    |                               |
                    |                       spin_lock_irqsave
                 DMASEV                             |
                    |                               |
                    |                           mask INTEN
                    |                               |
                    |                            DMAKILL
                    |                               |
                    |                       spin_unlock_irqrestore
    
    in above case, a interrupt was left, and if we unmask INTEN, the DMAC
    will set irq<event_num> HIGH to generate interrupt.
    
    to fix this, do as follows:
    
            DMA EXECUTING INSTRUCTS         DMA TERMINATE
                    |                               |
                    |                               |
                   ...                            _stop
                    |                               |
                    |                       spin_lock_irqsave
                 DMASEV                             |
                    |                               |

    The function currently works perfectly fine in a multidrop bus, but when we
    have only a single slave connected, then only a Skip ROM is used and Match
    ROM is not called at all. This is leading to problems e.g. with single one
    DS2408 connected, as the Resume Command is not working properly and the
    device is responding with failing results after the Resume Command.
    
    This commit is fixing this by using a Skip ROM instead in those cases.
    The bandwidth / performance advantage is exactly the same.

    rtc: 88pm860x: prevent use-after-free on device remove
    
    [ Upstream commit f22b1ba15ee5785aa028384ebf77dd39e8e47b70 ]
    
    The device's remove() attempts to shut down the delayed_work scheduled
    on the kernel-global workqueue by calling flush_scheduled_work().
    
    Unfortunately, flush_scheduled_work() does not prevent the delayed_work
    from re-scheduling itself. The delayed_work might run after the device
    has been removed, and touch the already de-allocated info structure.
    This is a potential use-after-free.
    
    Fix by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync() during remove(): this ensures
    that the delayed work is properly cancelled, is no longer running, and
    is not able to re-schedule itself.
    
    This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.

    brcm80211: potential NULL dereference in brcmf_cfg80211_vndr_cmds_dcmd_handler()
    
    [ Upstream commit e025da3d7aa4770bb1d1b3b0aa7cc4da1744852d ]
    
    If "ret_len" is negative then it could lead to a NULL dereference.
    
    The "ret_len" value comes from nl80211_vendor_cmd(), if it's negative
    then we don't allocate the "dcmd_buf" buffer.  Then we pass "ret_len" to
    brcmf_fil_cmd_data_set() where it is cast to a very high u32 value.
    Most of the functions in that call tree check whether the buffer we pass
    is NULL but there are at least a couple places which don't such as
    brcmf_dbg_hex_dump() and brcmf_msgbuf_query_dcmd().  We memcpy() to and
    from the buffer so it would result in a NULL dereference.
    
    The fix is to change the types so that "ret_len" can't be negative.  (If
    we memcpy() zero bytes to NULL, that's a no-op and doesn't cause an
    issue).

    spi: pxa2xx: fix SCR (divisor) calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit 29f2133717c527f492933b0622a4aafe0b3cbe9e ]
    
    Calculate the divisor for the SCR (Serial Clock Rate), avoiding
    that the SSP transmission rate can be greater than the device rate.
    
    When the division between the SSP clock and the device rate generates
    a reminder, we have to increment by one the divisor.
    In this way the resulting SSP clock will never be greater than the
    device SPI max frequency.
    
    For example, with:
    
     - ssp_clk  = 50 MHz
     - dev freq = 15 MHz
    
    without this patch the SSP clock will be greater than 15 MHz:
    
     - 25 MHz for PXA25x_SSP and CE4100_SSP
     - 16,56 MHz for the others
    
    Instead, with this patch, we have in both case an SSP clock of 12.5MHz,
    so the max rate of the SPI device clock is respected.

    ASoC: imx: fix fiq dependencies
    
    [ Upstream commit ea751227c813ab833609afecfeedaf0aa26f327e ]
    
    During randconfig builds, I occasionally run into an invalid configuration
    of the freescale FIQ sound support:
    
    WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SND_SOC_IMX_PCM_FIQ
      Depends on [m]: SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && SND_IMX_SOC [=m]
      Selected by [y]:

    imx-ssi.c:(.text+0xa64): undefined reference to `imx_pcm_fiq_init'
    
    The Kconfig warning is a result of the symbol being defined inside of
    the "if SND_IMX_SOC" block, and is otherwise harmless. The link error
    is more tricky and happens with SND_SOC_IMX_SSI=y, which may or may not
    imply FIQ support. However, if SND_SOC_FSL_SSI is set to =m at the same
    time, that selects SND_SOC_IMX_PCM_FIQ as a loadable module dependency,
    which then causes a link failure from imx-ssi.
    
    The solution here is to make SND_SOC_IMX_PCM_FIQ built-in whenever
    one of its potential users is built-in.

    mmc: core: Verify SD bus width
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e4be8d03f50d1b25c38e2b59e73b194c130df7d ]
    
    The SD Physical Layer Spec says the following: Since the SD Memory Card
    shall support at least the two bus modes 1-bit or 4-bit width, then any SD
    Card shall set at least bits 0 and 2 (SD_BUS_WIDTH="0101").
    
    This change verifies the card has specified a bus width.
    
    AMD SDHC Device 7806 can get into a bad state after a card disconnect
    where anything transferred via the DATA lines will always result in a
    zero filled buffer. Currently the driver will continue without error if
    the HC is in this condition. A block device will be created, but reading
    from it will result in a zero buffer. This makes it seem like the SD
    device has been erased, when in actuality the data is never getting
    copied from the DATA lines to the data buffer.
    
    SCR is the first command in the SD initialization sequence that uses the
    DATA lines. By checking that the response was invalid, we can abort
    mounting the card.

    gfs2: Fix lru_count going negative
    
    [ Upstream commit 7881ef3f33bb80f459ea6020d1e021fc524a6348 ]
    
    Under certain conditions, lru_count may drop below zero resulting in
    a large amount of log spam like this:
    
    vmscan: shrink_slab: gfs2_dump_glock+0x3b0/0x630 [gfs2] \
        negative objects to delete nr=-1
    
    This happens as follows:
    1) A glock is moved from lru_list to the dispose list and lru_count is
       decremented.
    2) The dispose function calls cond_resched() and drops the lru lock.
    3) Another thread takes the lru lock and tries to add the same glock to
       lru_list, checking if the glock is on an lru list.
    4) It is on a list (actually the dispose list) and so it avoids
       incrementing lru_count.
    5) The glock is moved to lru_list.
    5) The original thread doesn't dispose it because it has been re-added
       to the lru list but the lru_count has still decreased by one.
    
    Fix by checking if the LRU flag is set on the glock rather than checking
    if the glock is on some list and rearrange the code so that the LRU flag
    is added/removed precisely when the glock is added/removed from lru_list.

    to define BITS_PER_LONG, to avoid clashes with asm/bitsperlong.h.
    
    And the things removed from tools/include/linux/bitops.h are really in
    linux/bits.h, so that we can have a copy and then
    tools/perf/check_headers.sh will tell us when new stuff gets added to
    linux/bits.h so that we can check if it is useful and if any adjustment
    needs to be done to the tools/{include,arch}/ copies.

    In ssb_modinit, it does not fail SSB init when ssb_host_pcmcia_init failed,
    however in ssb_modexit, ssb_host_pcmcia_exit calls pcmcia_unregister_driver
    unconditionally, which may tigger a NULL pointer dereference issue as above.

    media: vivid: use vfree() instead of kfree() for dev->bitmap_cap
    
    commit dad7e270ba712ba1c99cd2d91018af6044447a06 upstream.
    
    syzkaller reported crashes on kfree() called from
    vivid_vid_cap_s_selection(). This looks like a simple typo, as
    dev->bitmap_cap is allocated with vzalloc() throughout the file.

    hugetlb: use same fault hash key for shared and private mappings
    
    commit 1b426bac66e6cc83c9f2d92b96e4e72acf43419a upstream.
    
    hugetlb uses a fault mutex hash table to prevent page faults of the
    same pages concurrently.  The key for shared and private mappings is
    different.  Shared keys off address_space and file index.  Private keys
    off mm and virtual address.  Consider a private mappings of a populated
    hugetlbfs file.  A fault will map the page from the file and if needed
    do a COW to map a writable page.
    
    Hugetlbfs hole punch uses the fault mutex to prevent mappings of file
    pages.  It uses the address_space file index key.  However, private
    mappings will use a different key and could race with this code to map
    the file page.  This causes problems (BUG) for the page cache remove
    code as it expects the page to be unmapped.  A sample stack is:
    
    page dumped because: VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_mapped(page))
    kernel BUG at mm/filemap.c:169!
    ...
    RIP: 0010:unaccount_page_cache_page+0x1b8/0x200
    ...

    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9
    
    There seems to be another potential COW issue/race with this approach
    of different private and shared keys as noted in commit 8382d914ebf7
    ("mm, hugetlb: improve page-fault scalability").
    
    Since every hugetlb mapping (even anon and private) is actually a file
    mapping, just use the address_space index key for all mappings.  This
    results in potentially more hash collisions.  However, this should not
    be the common case.

    btrfs: sysfs: don't leak memory when failing add fsid
    
    commit e32773357d5cc271b1d23550b3ed026eb5c2a468 upstream.
    
    A failed call to kobject_init_and_add() must be followed by a call to
    kobject_put().  Currently in the error path when adding fs_devices we
    are missing this call.  This could be fixed by calling
    btrfs_sysfs_remove_fsid() if btrfs_sysfs_add_fsid() returns an error or
    by adding a call to kobject_put() directly in btrfs_sysfs_add_fsid().
    Here we choose the second option because it prevents the slightly
    unusual error path handling requirements of kobject from leaking out
    into btrfs functions.
    
    Add a call to kobject_put() in the error path of kobject_add_and_init().
    This causes the release method to be called if kobject_init_and_add()
    fails.  open_tree() is the function that calls btrfs_sysfs_add_fsid()
    and the error code in this function is already written with the
    assumption that the release method is called during the error path of
    open_tree() (as seen by the call to btrfs_sysfs_remove_fsid() under the
    fail_fsdev_sysfs label).

    Btrfs: fix race between ranged fsync and writeback of adjacent ranges
    
    commit 0c713cbab6200b0ab6473b50435e450a6e1de85d upstream.
    
    When we do a full fsync (the bit BTRFS_INODE_NEEDS_FULL_SYNC is set in the
    inode) that happens to be ranged, which happens during a msync() or writes
    for files opened with O_SYNC for example, we can end up with a corrupt log,
    due to different file extent items representing ranges that overlap with
    each other, or hit some assertion failures.
    
    When doing a ranged fsync we only flush delalloc and wait for ordered
    exents within that range. If while we are logging items from our inode
    ordered extents for adjacent ranges complete, we end up in a race that can
    make us insert the file extent items that overlap with others we logged
    previously and the assertion failures.
    
    For example, if tree-log.c:copy_items() receives a leaf that has the
    following file extents items, all with a length of 4K and therefore there
    is an implicit hole in the range 68K to 72K - 1:
    
      (257 EXTENT_ITEM 64K), (257 EXTENT_ITEM 72K), (257 EXTENT_ITEM 76K), ...
    
    It copies them to the log tree. However due to the need to detect implicit
    holes, it may release the path, in order to look at the previous leaf to
    detect an implicit hole, and then later it will search again in the tree
    for the first file extent item key, with the goal of locking again the
    leaf (which might have changed due to concurrent changes to other inodes).
    
    However when it locks again the leaf containing the first key, the key
    corresponding to the extent at offset 72K may not be there anymore since
    there is an ordered extent for that range that is finishing (that is,
    somewhere in the middle of btrfs_finish_ordered_io()), and it just
    removed the file extent item but has not yet replaced it with a new file
    extent item, so the part of copy_items() that does hole detection will
    decide that there is a hole in the range starting from 68K to 76K - 1,
    and therefore insert a file extent item to represent that hole, having
    a key offset of 68K. After that we now have a log tree with 2 different
    extent items that have overlapping ranges:
    
     1) The file extent item copied before copy_items() released the path,
        which has a key offset of 72K and a length of 4K, representing the
        file range 72K to 76K - 1.
    
     2) And a file extent item representing a hole that has a key offset of
        68K and a length of 8K, representing the range 68K to 76K - 1. This
        item was inserted after releasing the path, and overlaps with the
        extent item inserted before.
    
    The overlapping extent items can cause all sorts of unpredictable and
    incorrect behaviour, either when replayed or if a fast (non full) fsync
    happens later, which can trigger a BUG_ON() when calling
    btrfs_set_item_key_safe() through __btrfs_drop_extents(), producing a
    trace like the following:

    The file extent item at offset 659456 (item 15) ends at offset 823296
    (659456 + 163840) while the next file extent item (item 16) starts at
    offset 663552.
    
    Another different problem that the race can trigger is a failure in the
    assertions at tree-log.c:copy_items(), which expect that the first file
    extent item key we found before releasing the path exists after we have
    released path and that the last key we found before releasing the path
    also exists after releasing the path:
    
      $ cat -n fs/btrfs/tree-log.c
      4080          if (need_find_last_extent) {
      4081                  /* btrfs_prev_leaf could return 1 without releasing the path */
      4082                  btrfs_release_path(src_path);
      4083                  ret = btrfs_search_slot(NULL, inode->root, &first_key,
      4084                                  src_path, 0, 0);
      4085                  if (ret < 0)
      4086                          return ret;
      4087                  ASSERT(ret == 0);
      (...)
      4103                  if (i >= btrfs_header_nritems(src_path->nodes[0])) {
      4104                          ret = btrfs_next_leaf(inode->root, src_path);
      4105                          if (ret < 0)
      4106                                  return ret;
      4107                          ASSERT(ret == 0);
      4108                          src = src_path->nodes[0];
      4109                          i = 0;
      4110                          need_find_last_extent = true;
      4111                  }
      (...)
    
    The second assertion implicitly expects that the last key before the path
    release still exists, because the surrounding while loop only stops after
    we have found that key. When this assertion fails it produces a stack like
    this:

    So fix this race between a full ranged fsync and writeback of adjacent
    ranges by flushing all delalloc and waiting for all ordered extents to
    complete before logging the inode. This is the simplest way to solve the
    problem because currently the full fsync path does not deal with ranges
    at all (it assumes a full range from 0 to LLONG_MAX) and it always needs
    to look at adjacent ranges for hole detection. For use cases of ranged
    fsyncs this can make a few fsyncs slower but on the other hand it can
    make some following fsyncs to other ranges do less work or no need to do
    anything at all. A full fsync is rare anyway and happens only once after
    loading/creating an inode and once after less common operations such as a
    shrinking truncate.
    
    This is an issue that exists for a long time, and was often triggered by
    generic/127, because it does mmap'ed writes and msync (which triggers a
    ranged fsync). Adding support for the tree checker to detect overlapping
    extents (next patch in the series) and trigger a WARN() when such cases
    are found, and then calling btrfs_check_leaf_full() at the end of
    btrfs_insert_file_extent() made the issue much easier to detect. Running
    btrfs/072 with that change to the tree checker and making fsstress open
    files always with O_SYNC made it much easier to trigger the issue (as
    triggering it with generic/127 is very rare).

    gfs2: Fix sign extension bug in gfs2_update_stats
    
    commit 5a5ec83d6ac974b12085cd99b196795f14079037 upstream.
    
    Commit 4d207133e9c3 changed the types of the statistic values in struct
    gfs2_lkstats from s64 to u64.  Because of that, what should be a signed
    value in gfs2_update_stats turned into an unsigned value.  When shifted
    right, we end up with a large positive value instead of a small negative
    value, which results in an incorrect variance estimate.

    crypto: vmx - CTR: always increment IV as quadword
    
    commit 009b30ac7444c17fae34c4f435ebce8e8e2b3250 upstream.
    
    The kernel self-tests picked up an issue with CTR mode:
    alg: skcipher: p8_aes_ctr encryption test failed (wrong result) on test vector 3, cfg="uneven misaligned splits, may sleep"
    
    Test vector 3 has an IV of FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFD, so
    after 3 increments it should wrap around to 0.
    
    In the aesp8-ppc code from OpenSSL, there are two paths that
    increment IVs: the bulk (8 at a time) path, and the individual
    path which is used when there are fewer than 8 AES blocks to
    process.
    
    In the bulk path, the IV is incremented with vadduqm: "Vector
    Add Unsigned Quadword Modulo", which does 128-bit addition.
    
    In the individual path, however, the IV is incremented with
    vadduwm: "Vector Add Unsigned Word Modulo", which instead
    does 4 32-bit additions. Thus the IV would instead become
    FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF00000000, throwing off the result.
    
    Use vadduqm.
    
    This was probably a typo originally, what with q and w being
    adjacent. It is a pretty narrow edge case: I am really
    impressed by the quality of the kernel self-tests!

    Revert "scsi: sd: Keep disk read-only when re-reading partition"
    
    commit 8acf608e602f6ec38b7cc37b04c80f1ce9a1a6cc upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 20bd1d026aacc5399464f8328f305985c493cde3.
    
    This patch introduced regressions for devices that come online in
    read-only state and subsequently switch to read-write.
    
    Given how the partition code is currently implemented it is not
    possible to persist the read-only flag across a device revalidate
    call. This may need to get addressed in the future since it is common
    for user applications to proactively call BLKRRPART.
    
    Reverting this commit will re-introduce a regression where a
    device-initiated revalidate event will cause the admin state to be
    forgotten. A separate patch will address this issue.

    ext4: do not delete unlinked inode from orphan list on failed truncate
    
    commit ee0ed02ca93ef1ecf8963ad96638795d55af2c14 upstream.
    
    It is possible that unlinked inode enters ext4_setattr() (e.g. if
    somebody calls ftruncate(2) on unlinked but still open file). In such
    case we should not delete the inode from the orphan list if truncate
    fails. Note that this is mostly a theoretical concern as filesystem is
    corrupted if we reach this path anyway but let's be consistent in our
    orphan handling.

    fbdev: sm712fb: fix memory frequency by avoiding a switch/case fallthrough
    
    commit 9dc20113988b9a75ea6b3abd68dc45e2d73ccdab upstream.
    
    A fallthrough in switch/case was introduced in f627caf55b8e ("fbdev:
    sm712fb: fix crashes and garbled display during DPMS modesetting"),
    due to my copy-paste error, which would cause the memory clock frequency
    for SM720 to be programmed to SM712.
    
    Since it only reprograms the clock to a different frequency, it's only
    a benign issue without visible side-effect, so it also evaded Sudip
    Mukherjee's code review and regression tests. scripts/checkpatch.pl
    also failed to discover the issue, possibly due to nested switch
    statements.
    
    This issue was found by Stephen Rothwell by building linux-next with
    -Wimplicit-fallthrough.

    btrfs: Honour FITRIM range constraints during free space trim
    
    commit c2d1b3aae33605a61cbab445d8ae1c708ccd2698 upstream.
    
    Up until now trimming the freespace was done irrespective of what the
    arguments of the FITRIM ioctl were. For example fstrim's -o/-l arguments
    will be entirely ignored. Fix it by correctly handling those paramter.
    This requires breaking if the found freespace extent is after the end of
    the passed range as well as completing trim after trimming

    commit b2176a1dfb518d870ee073445d27055fea64dfb8 upstream.
    
    The problem is that any 'uptodate' vs 'disks' check is not precise
    in this path. Put a "WARN_ON(!test_bit(R5_UPTODATE, &dev->flags)" on the
    device that might try to kick off writes and then skip the action.
    Better to prevent the raid driver from taking unexpected action *and* keep
    the system alive vs killing the machine with BUG_ON.

    perf bench numa: Add define for RUSAGE_THREAD if not present
    
    [ Upstream commit bf561d3c13423fc54daa19b5d49dc15fafdb7acc ]
    
    While cross building perf to the ARC architecture on a fedora 30 host,
    we were failing with:
    
          CC       /tmp/build/perf/bench/numa.o
      bench/numa.c: In function ‘worker_thread’:
      bench/numa.c:1261:12: error: ‘RUSAGE_THREAD’ undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean ‘SIGEV_THREAD’?
        getrusage(RUSAGE_THREAD, &rusage);
                  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
                  SIGEV_THREAD
      bench/numa.c:1261:12: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in

    [perfbuilder@60d5802468f6 perf]$
    
    Trying to reproduce a report by Vineet, I noticed that, with just
    cross-built zlib and numactl libraries, I ended up with the above
    failure.
    
    So, since RUSAGE_THREAD is available as a define, check for that and
    numactl libraries, I ended up with the above failure.
    
    So, since RUSAGE_THREAD is available as a define in the system headers,
    check if it is defined in the 'perf bench numa' sources and define it if
    not.
    
    Now it builds and I have to figure out if the problem reported by Vineet
    only takes place if we have libelf or some other library available.

    power: supply: sysfs: prevent endless uevent loop with CONFIG_POWER_SUPPLY_DEBUG
    
    [ Upstream commit 349ced9984ff540ce74ca8a0b2e9b03dc434b9dd ]
    
    Fix a similar endless event loop as was done in commit
    8dcf32175b4e ("i2c: prevent endless uevent loop with
    CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_CORE"):
    
      The culprit is the dev_dbg printk in the i2c uevent handler. If
      this is activated (for instance by CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_CORE) it results
      in an endless loop with systemd-journald.
    
      This happens if user-space scans the system log and reads the uevent
      file to get information about a newly created device, which seems
      fair use to me. Unfortunately reading the "uevent" file uses the
      same function that runs for creating the uevent for a new device,
      generating the next syslog entry
    
    Both CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_CORE and CONFIG_POWER_SUPPLY_DEBUG were reported
    in https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=76886 but only former
    seems to have been fixed. Drop debug prints as it was done in I2C
    subsystem to resolve the issue.

    KVM: arm/arm64: Ensure vcpu target is unset on reset failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 811328fc3222f7b55846de0cd0404339e2e1e6d7 ]
    
    A failed KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT should not set the vcpu target,
    as the vcpu target is used by kvm_vcpu_initialized() to
    determine if other vcpu ioctls may proceed. We need to set
    the target before calling kvm_reset_vcpu(), but if that call
    fails, we should then unset it and clear the feature bitmap
    while we're at it.

    fbdev: sm712fb: fix crashes and garbled display during DPMS modesetting
    
    commit f627caf55b8e735dcec8fa6538e9668632b55276 upstream.
    
    On a Thinkpad s30 (Pentium III / i440MX, Lynx3DM), blanking the display
    or starting the X server will crash and freeze the system, or garble the
    display.
    
    Experiments showed this problem can mostly be solved by adjusting the
    order of register writes. Also, sm712fb failed to consider the difference
    of clock frequency when unblanking the display, and programs the clock for
    SM712 to SM720.
    
    Fix them by adjusting the order of register writes, and adding an
    additional check for SM720 for programming the clock frequency.

    fbdev: sm712fb: use 1024x768 by default on non-MIPS, fix garbled display
    
    commit 4ed7d2ccb7684510ec5f7a8f7ef534bc6a3d55b2 upstream.
    
    Loongson MIPS netbooks use 1024x600 LCD panels, which is the original
    target platform of this driver, but nearly all old x86 laptops have
    1024x768. Lighting 768 panels using 600's timings would partially
    garble the display. Since it's not possible to distinguish them reliably,
    we change the default to 768, but keep 600 as-is on MIPS.
    
    Further, earlier laptops, such as IBM Thinkpad 240X, has a 800x600 LCD
    panel, this driver would probably garbled those display. As we don't
    have one for testing, the original behavior of the driver is kept as-is,
    but the problem has been documented is the comments.

    the 1024x768-16 support was still claimed but not working.
    
    Fix it by introducing the 1024x768-16 mode.

    fbdev: sm712fb: fix crashes during framebuffer writes by correctly mapping VRAM
    
    commit 9e0e59993df0601cddb95c4f6c61aa3d5e753c00 upstream.
    
    On a Thinkpad s30 (Pentium III / i440MX, Lynx3DM), running fbtest or X
    will crash the machine instantly, because the VRAM/framebuffer is not
    mapped correctly.
    
    On SM712, the framebuffer starts at the beginning of address space, but
    SM720's framebuffer starts at the 1 MiB offset from the beginning. However,
    sm712fb fails to take this into account, as a result, writing to the
    framebuffer will destroy all the registers and kill the system immediately.
    Another problem is the driver assumes 8 MiB of VRAM for SM720, but some
    SM720 system, such as this IBM Thinkpad, only has 4 MiB of VRAM.
    
    Fix this problem by removing the hardcoded VRAM size, adding a function to
    query the amount of VRAM from register MCR76 on SM720, and adding proper
    framebuffer offset.
    
    Please note that the memory map may have additional problems on Big-Endian
    system, which is not available for testing by myself. But I highly suspect
    that the original code is also broken on Big-Endian machines for SM720, so
    at least we are not making the problem worse. More, the driver also assumed
    SM710/SM712 has 4 MiB of VRAM, but it has a 2 MiB version as well, and used
    in earlier laptops, such as IBM Thinkpad 240X, the driver would probably
    crash on them. I've never seen one of those machines and cannot fix it, but
    I have documented these problems in the comments.

    fbdev: sm712fb: fix boot screen glitch when sm712fb replaces VGA
    
    commit ec1587d5073f29820e358f3a383850d61601d981 upstream.
    
    When the machine is booted in VGA mode, loading sm712fb would cause
    a glitch of random pixels shown on the screen. To prevent it from
    happening, we first clear the entire framebuffer, and we also need
    to stop calling smtcfb_setmode() during initialization, the fbdev
    layer will call it for us later when it's ready.

    fbdev: sm712fb: fix white screen of death on reboot, don't set CR3B-CR3F
    
    commit 8069053880e0ee3a75fd6d7e0a30293265fe3de4 upstream.
    
    On a Thinkpad s30 (Pentium III / i440MX, Lynx3DM), rebooting with
    sm712fb framebuffer driver would cause a white screen of death on
    the next POST, presumably the proper timings for the LCD panel was
    not reprogrammed properly by the BIOS.
    
    Experiments showed a few CRTC Scratch Registers, including CRT3D,
    CRT3E and CRT3F may be used internally by BIOS as some flags. CRT3B is
    a hardware testing register, we shouldn't mess with it. CRT3C has
    blanking signal and line compare control, which is not needed for this
    driver.
    
    Stop writing to CR3B-CR3F (a.k.a CRT3B-CRT3F) registers. Even if these
    registers don't have side-effect on other systems, writing to them is
    also highly questionable.

    fbdev: sm712fb: fix VRAM detection, don't set SR70/71/74/75
    
    commit dcf9070595e100942c539e229dde4770aaeaa4e9 upstream.
    
    On a Thinkpad s30 (Pentium III / i440MX, Lynx3DM), the amount of Video
    RAM is not detected correctly by the xf86-video-siliconmotion driver.
    This is because sm712fb overwrites the GPR71 Scratch Pad Register, which
    is set by BIOS on x86 and used to indicate amount of VRAM.
    
    Other Scratch Pad Registers, including GPR70/74/75, don't have the same
    side-effect, but overwriting to them is still questionable, as they are
    not related to modesetting.
    
    Stop writing to SR70/71/74/75 (a.k.a GPR70/71/74/75).

    resistors to indicate the type of LCD panel. We should not mess with
    it.

    perf intel-pt: Fix sample timestamp wrt non-taken branches
    
    commit 1b6599a9d8e6c9f7e9b0476012383b1777f7fc93 upstream.
    
    The sample timestamp is updated to ensure that the timestamp represents
    the time of the sample and not a branch that the decoder is still
    walking towards. The sample timestamp is updated when the decoder
    returns, but the decoder does not return for non-taken branches. Update
    the sample timestamp then also.
    
    Note that commit 3f04d98e972b5 ("perf intel-pt: Improve sample
    timestamp") was also a stable fix and appears, for example, in v4.4
    stable tree as commit a4ebb58fd124 ("perf intel-pt: Improve sample

    perf intel-pt: Fix improved sample timestamp
    
    commit 61b6e08dc8e3ea80b7485c9b3f875ddd45c8466b upstream.
    
    The decoder uses its current timestamp in samples. Usually that is a
    timestamp that has already passed, but in some cases it is a timestamp
    for a branch that the decoder is walking towards, and consequently
    hasn't reached.
    
    The intel_pt_sample_time() function decides which is which, but was not
    handling TNT packets exactly correctly.
    
    In the case of TNT, the timestamp applies to the first branch, so the
    decoder must first walk to that branch.
    
    That means intel_pt_sample_time() should return true for TNT, and this
    patch makes that change. However, if the first branch is a non-taken
    branch (i.e. a 'N'), then intel_pt_sample_time() needs to return false
    for subsequent taken branches in the same TNT packet.
    
    To handle that, introduce a new state INTEL_PT_STATE_TNT_CONT to
    distinguish the cases.
    
    Note that commit 3f04d98e972b5 ("perf intel-pt: Improve sample
    timestamp") was also a stable fix and appears, for example, in v4.4
    stable tree as commit a4ebb58fd124 ("perf intel-pt: Improve sample

    perf intel-pt: Fix instructions sampling rate
    
    commit 7ba8fa20e26eb3c0c04d747f7fd2223694eac4d5 upstream.
    
    The timestamp used to determine if an instruction sample is made, is an
    estimate based on the number of instructions since the last known
    timestamp. A consequence is that it might go backwards, which results in
    extra samples. Change it so that a sample is only made when the
    timestamp goes forwards.
    
    Note this does not affect a sampling period of 0 or sampling periods
    specified as a count of instructions.

    tracing: Fix partial reading of trace event's id file
    
    commit cbe08bcbbe787315c425dde284dcb715cfbf3f39 upstream.
    
    When reading only part of the id file, the ppos isn't tracked correctly.
    This is taken care by simple_read_from_buffer.
    
    Reading a single byte, and then the next byte would result EOF.
    
    While this seems like not a big deal, this breaks abstractions that
    reads information from files unbuffered. See for example
    https://github.com/golang/go/issues/29399
    
    This code was mentioned as problematic in
    commit cd458ba9d5a5
    ("tracing: Do not (ab)use trace_seq in event_id_read()")
    
    An example C code that show this bug is:
    
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <stdint.h>
    
      #include <sys/types.h>
      #include <sys/stat.h>
      #include <fcntl.h>
      #include <unistd.h>
    
      int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        if (argc < 2)
          return 1;
        int fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
        char c;
        read(fd, &c, 1);
        printf("First  %c\n", c);
        read(fd, &c, 1);
        printf("Second %c\n", c);
      }
    
    Then run with, e.g.
    
      sudo ./a.out /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/tcp/tcp_set_state/id
    
    You'll notice you're getting the first character twice, instead of the
    first two characters in the id file.

    iommu/tegra-smmu: Fix invalid ASID bits on Tegra30/114
    
    commit 43a0541e312f7136e081e6bf58f6c8a2e9672688 upstream.
    
    Both Tegra30 and Tegra114 have 4 ASID's and the corresponding bitfield of
    the TLB_FLUSH register differs from later Tegra generations that have 128
    ASID's.
    
    In a result the PTE's are now flushed correctly from TLB and this fixes
    problems with graphics (randomly failing tests) on Tegra30.

    fuse: honor RLIMIT_FSIZE in fuse_file_fallocate
    
    commit 0cbade024ba501313da3b7e5dd2a188a6bc491b5 upstream.
    
    fstests generic/228 reported this failure that fuse fallocate does not
    honor what 'ulimit -f' has set.
    
    This adds the necessary inode_newsize_ok() check.

    fuse: fix writepages on 32bit
    
    commit 9de5be06d0a89ca97b5ab902694d42dfd2bb77d2 upstream.
    
    Writepage requests were cropped to i_size & 0xffffffff, which meant that
    mmaped writes to any file larger than 4G might be silently discarded.
    
    Fix by storing the file size in a properly sized variable (loff_t instead
    of size_t).

    clk: tegra: Fix PLLM programming on Tegra124+ when PMC overrides divider
    
    commit 40db569d6769ffa3864fd1b89616b1a7323568a8 upstream.
    
    There are wrongly set parenthesis in the code that are resulting in a
    wrong configuration being programmed for PLLM. The original fix was made
    by Danny Huang in the downstream kernel. The patch was tested on Nyan Big
    Tegra124 chromebook, PLLM rate changing works correctly now and system
    doesn't lock up after changing the PLLM rate due to EMC scaling.

    NFS4: Fix v4.0 client state corruption when mount
    
    commit f02f3755dbd14fb935d24b14650fff9ba92243b8 upstream.
    
    stat command with soft mount never return after server is stopped.
    
    When alloc a new client, the state of the client will be set to
    NFS4CLNT_LEASE_EXPIRED.
    
    When the server is stopped, the state manager will work, and accord
    the state to recover. But the state is NFS4CLNT_LEASE_EXPIRED, it
    will drain the slot table and lead other task to wait queue, until
    the client recovered. Then the stat command is hung.
    
    When discover server trunking, the client will renew the lease,
    but check the client state, it lead the client state corruption.
    
    So, we need to call state manager to recover it when detect server
    ip trunking.

    media: ov6650: Fix sensor possibly not detected on probe
    
    commit 933c1320847f5ed6b61a7d10f0a948aa98ccd7b0 upstream.
    
    After removal of clock_start() from before soc_camera_init_i2c() in
    soc_camera_probe() by commit 9aea470b399d ("[media] soc-camera: switch
    I2C subdevice drivers to use v4l2-clk") introduced in v3.11, the ov6650
    driver could no longer probe the sensor successfully because its clock
    was no longer turned on in advance.  The issue was initially worked
    around by adding that missing clock_start() equivalent to OMAP1 camera
    interface driver - the only user of this sensor - but a propoer fix
    should be rather implemented in the sensor driver code itself.
    
    Fix the issue by inserting a delay between the clock is turned on and
    the sensor I2C registers are read for the first time.
    
    Tested on Amstrad Delta with now out of tree but still locally
    maintained omap1_camera host driver.

    Currently, the pages that are allocated for the single mode of MSC are not
    mapped into the device's dma space and the code is incorrectly using
    *_to_phys() in place of a dma address. This fails with IOMMU enabled and

    [ Upstream commit 7e27e8d6130c5e88fac9ddec4249f7f2337fe7f8 ]
    
    When tipc is loaded while many processes try to create a TIPC socket,
    a crash occurs:
     PANIC: Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual
     address "dfff20000000021d"

      __sys_socket+0xec/0x1f0
      __arm64_sys_socket+0x74/0xa8
     ...
    
    This is due to race between sock_create and unfinished
    register_pernet_device. tipc_sk_insert tries to do
    "net_generic(net, tipc_net_id)".
    but tipc_net_id is not initialized yet.
    
    So switch the order of the two to close the race.
    
    This can be reproduced with multiple processes doing socket(AF_TIPC, ...)
    and one process doing module removal.

    KVM: x86: Skip EFER vs. guest CPUID checks for host-initiated writes
    
    commit 11988499e62b310f3bf6f6d0a807a06d3f9ccc96 upstream.
    
    KVM allows userspace to violate consistency checks related to the
    guest's CPUID model to some degree.  Generally speaking, userspace has
    carte blanche when it comes to guest state so long as jamming invalid
    state won't negatively affect the host.
    
    Currently this is seems to be a non-issue as most of the interesting
    EFER checks are missing, e.g. NX and LME, but those will be added
    shortly.  Proactively exempt userspace from the CPUID checks so as not
    to break userspace.
    
    Note, the efer_reserved_bits check still applies to userspace writes as
    that mask reflects the host's capabilities, e.g. KVM shouldn't allow a
    guest to run with NX=1 if it has been disabled in the host.

    commit 56df90b631fc027fe28b70d41352d820797239bb upstream.
    
    Add patch for realtek codec in Lenovo B50-70 that fixes inverted
    internal microphone channel.
    Device IdeaPad Y410P has the same PCI SSID as Lenovo B50-70,
    but first one is about fix the noise and it didn't seem help in a
    later kernel version.
    So I replaced IdeaPad Y410P device description with B50-70 and apply
    inverted microphone fix.

    ext4: zero out the unused memory region in the extent tree block
    
    commit 592acbf16821288ecdc4192c47e3774a4c48bb64 upstream.
    
    This commit zeroes out the unused memory region in the buffer_head
    corresponding to the extent metablock after writing the extent header
    and the corresponding extent node entries.
    
    This is done to prevent random uninitialized data from getting into
    the filesystem when the extent block is synced.

    writeback: synchronize sync(2) against cgroup writeback membership switches
    
    commit 7fc5854f8c6efae9e7624970ab49a1eac2faefb1 upstream.
    
    sync_inodes_sb() can race against cgwb (cgroup writeback) membership
    switches and fail to writeback some inodes.  For example, if an inode
    switches to another wb while sync_inodes_sb() is in progress, the new
    wb might not be visible to bdi_split_work_to_wbs() at all or the inode
    might jump from a wb which hasn't issued writebacks yet to one which
    already has.
    
    This patch adds backing_dev_info->wb_switch_rwsem to synchronize cgwb
    switch path against sync_inodes_sb() so that sync_inodes_sb() is
    guaranteed to see all the target wbs and inodes can't jump wbs to
    escape syncing.
    
    v2: Fixed misplaced rwsem init.  Spotted by Jiufei.

    crypto: arm/aes-neonbs - don't access already-freed walk.iv
    
    commit 767f015ea0b7ab9d60432ff6cd06b664fd71f50f upstream.
    
    If the user-provided IV needs to be aligned to the algorithm's
    alignmask, then skcipher_walk_virt() copies the IV into a new aligned
    buffer walk.iv.  But skcipher_walk_virt() can fail afterwards, and then
    if the caller unconditionally accesses walk.iv, it's a use-after-free.
    
    arm32 xts-aes-neonbs doesn't set an alignmask, so currently it isn't
    affected by this despite unconditionally accessing walk.iv.  However
    this is more subtle than desired, and it was actually broken prior to
    the alignmask being removed by commit cc477bf64573 ("crypto: arm/aes -
    replace bit-sliced OpenSSL NEON code").  Thus, update xts-aes-neonbs to
    start checking the return value of skcipher_walk_virt().

    crypto: chacha20poly1305 - set cra_name correctly
    
    commit 5e27f38f1f3f45a0c938299c3a34a2d2db77165a upstream.
    
    If the rfc7539 template is instantiated with specific implementations,
    e.g. "rfc7539(chacha20-generic,poly1305-generic)" rather than
    "rfc7539(chacha20,poly1305)", then the implementation names end up
    included in the instance's cra_name.  This is incorrect because it then
    prevents all users from allocating "rfc7539(chacha20,poly1305)", if the
    highest priority implementations of chacha20 and poly1305 were selected.
    Also, the self-tests aren't run on an instance allocated in this way.
    
    Fix it by setting the instance's cra_name from the underlying
    algorithms' actual cra_names, rather than from the requested names.
    This matches what other templates do.

    crypto: gcm - fix incompatibility between "gcm" and "gcm_base"
    
    commit f699594d436960160f6d5ba84ed4a222f20d11cd upstream.
    
    GCM instances can be created by either the "gcm" template, which only
    allows choosing the block cipher, e.g. "gcm(aes)"; or by "gcm_base",
    which allows choosing the ctr and ghash implementations, e.g.
    "gcm_base(ctr(aes-generic),ghash-generic)".
    
    However, a "gcm_base" instance prevents a "gcm" instance from being
    registered using the same implementations.  Nor will the instance be
    found by lookups of "gcm".  This can be used as a denial of service.
    Moreover, "gcm_base" instances are never tested by the crypto
    self-tests, even if there are compatible "gcm" tests.
    
    The root cause of these problems is that instances of the two templates
    use different cra_names.  Therefore, fix these problems by making
    "gcm_base" instances set the same cra_name as "gcm" instances, e.g.
    "gcm(aes)" instead of "gcm_base(ctr(aes-generic),ghash-generic)".
    
    This requires extracting the block cipher name from the name of the ctr
    algorithm.  It also requires starting to verify that the algorithms are
    really ctr and ghash, not something else entirely.  But it would be
    bizarre if anyone were actually using non-gcm-compatible algorithms with
    gcm_base, so this shouldn't break anyone in practice.

    Here, the 'blocknum' is data[0] which always starts from zero(0) and
    'ssif_info->multi_pos' starts from 1.
    So, we need to add +1 to blocknum while comparing with multi_pos.

    bcache: never set KEY_PTRS of journal key to 0 in journal_reclaim()
    
    commit 1bee2addc0c8470c8aaa65ef0599eeae96dd88bc upstream.
    
    In journal_reclaim() ja->cur_idx of each cache will be update to
    reclaim available journal buckets. Variable 'int n' is used to count how
    many cache is successfully reclaimed, then n is set to c->journal.key
    by SET_KEY_PTRS(). Later in journal_write_unlocked(), a for_each_cache()
    loop will write the jset data onto each cache.
    
    The problem is, if all jouranl buckets on each cache is full, the
    following code in journal_reclaim(),
    
    529 for_each_cache(ca, c, iter) {
    530       struct journal_device *ja = &ca->journal;
    531       unsigned int next = (ja->cur_idx + 1) % ca->sb.njournal_buckets;
    532
    533       /* No space available on this device */
    534       if (next == ja->discard_idx)
    535               continue;
    536
    537       ja->cur_idx = next;
    538       k->ptr[n++] = MAKE_PTR(0,
    539                         bucket_to_sector(c, ca->sb.d[ja->cur_idx]),
    540                         ca->sb.nr_this_dev);
    541 }
    542
    543 bkey_init(k);
    544 SET_KEY_PTRS(k, n);
    
    If there is no available bucket to reclaim, the if() condition at line
    534 will always true, and n remains 0. Then at line 544, SET_KEY_PTRS()
    will set KEY_PTRS field of c->journal.key to 0.
    
    Setting KEY_PTRS field of c->journal.key to 0 is wrong. Because in
    journal_write_unlocked() the journal data is written in following loop,
    
    649     for (i = 0; i < KEY_PTRS(k); i++) {
    650-671         submit journal data to cache device
    672     }
    
    If KEY_PTRS field is set to 0 in jouranl_reclaim(), the journal data
    won't be written to cache device here. If system crahed or rebooted
    before bkeys of the lost journal entries written into btree nodes, data
    corruption will be reported during bcache reload after rebooting the
    system.
    
    Indeed there is only one cache in a cache set, there is no need to set
    KEY_PTRS field in journal_reclaim() at all. But in order to keep the
    for_each_cache() logic consistent for now, this patch fixes the above
    problem by not setting 0 KEY_PTRS of journal key, if there is no bucket
    available to reclaim.

    bcache: fix a race between cache register and cacheset unregister
    
    commit a4b732a248d12cbdb46999daf0bf288c011335eb upstream.
    
    There is a race between cache device register and cache set unregister.
    For an already registered cache device, register_bcache will call
    bch_is_open to iterate through all cachesets and check every cache
    there. The race occurs if cache_set_free executes at the same time and
    clears the caches right before ca is dereferenced in bch_is_open_cache.
    To close the race, let's make sure the clean up work is protected by
    the bch_register_lock as well.
    
    This issue can be reproduced as follows,
    while true; do echo /dev/XXX> /sys/fs/bcache/register ; done&
    while true; do echo 1> /sys/block/XXX/bcache/set/unregister ; done &
    
    and results in the following oops,

    Btrfs: do not start a transaction at iterate_extent_inodes()
    
    commit bfc61c36260ca990937539cd648ede3cd749bc10 upstream.
    
    When finding out which inodes have references on a particular extent, done
    by backref.c:iterate_extent_inodes(), from the BTRFS_IOC_LOGICAL_INO (both
    v1 and v2) ioctl and from scrub we use the transaction join API to grab a
    reference on the currently running transaction, since in order to give
    accurate results we need to inspect the delayed references of the currently
    running transaction.
    
    However, if there is currently no running transaction, the join operation
    will create a new transaction. This is inefficient as the transaction will
    eventually be committed, doing unnecessary IO and introducing a potential
    point of failure that will lead to a transaction abort due to -ENOSPC, as
    recently reported [1].
    
    That's because the join, creates the transaction but does not reserve any
    space, so when attempting to update the root item of the root passed to
    btrfs_join_transaction(), during the transaction commit, we can end up
    failling with -ENOSPC. Users of a join operation are supposed to actually
    do some filesystem changes and reserve space by some means, which is not
    the case of iterate_extent_inodes(), it is a read-only operation for all
    contextes from which it is called.
    
    The reported [1] -ENOSPC failure stack trace is the following:

    commit 50b29d8f033a7c88c5bc011abc2068b1691ab755 upstream.
    
    Instead of removing EXT4_MOUNT_JOURNAL_CHECKSUM from s_def_mount_opt as
    I assume was intended, all other options were blown away leading to
    _ext4_show_options() output being incorrect.

    commit 310a997fd74de778b9a4848a64be9cda9f18764a upstream.
    
    It is never possible, that number of block groups decreases,
    since only online grow is supported.
    
    But after a growing occured, we have to zero inode tables
    for just created new block groups.

    race into adding the same entry into 'func_table' array at:
    
        drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c:vt_do_kdgkb_ioctl()
    
    The function has no locking around writes to 'func_table'.
    
    The simplest reproducer is to have initrams with the following
    init on a 8-CPU machine x86_64:
    
        #!/bin/sh
    
        loadkeys -q windowkeys ru4 &
        loadkeys -q windowkeys ru4 &

        loadkeys -q windowkeys ru4 &
        loadkeys -q windowkeys ru4 &
        loadkeys -q windowkeys ru4 &
        wait
    
    The change adds lock on write path only. Reads are still racy.

    ocfs2: fix ocfs2 read inode data panic in ocfs2_iget
    
    commit e091eab028f9253eac5c04f9141bbc9d170acab3 upstream.
    
    In some cases, ocfs2_iget() reads the data of inode, which has been
    deleted for some reason.  That will make the system panic.  So We should
    judge whether this inode has been deleted, and tell the caller that the
    inode is a bad inode.
    
    For example, the ocfs2 is used as the backed of nfs, and the client is
    nfsv3.  This issue can be reproduced by the following steps.
    
    on the nfs server side,
    ..../patha/pathb
    
    Step 1: The process A was scheduled before calling the function fh_verify.
    
    Step 2: The process B is removing the 'pathb', and just completed the call
    to function dput.  Then the dentry of 'pathb' has been deleted from the
    dcache, and all ancestors have been deleted also.  The relationship of
    dentry and inode was deleted through the function hlist_del_init.  The
    following is the call stack.
    dentry_iput->hlist_del_init(&dentry->d_u.d_alias)
    
    At this time, the inode is still in the dcache.
    
    Step 3: The process A call the function ocfs2_get_dentry, which get the
    inode from dcache.  Then the refcount of inode is 1.  The following is the
    call stack.
    nfsd3_proc_getacl->fh_verify->exportfs_decode_fh->fh_to_dentry(ocfs2_get_dentry)
    
    Step 4: Dirty pages are flushed by bdi threads.  So the inode of 'patha'
    is evicted, and this directory was deleted.  But the inode of 'pathb'
    can't be evicted, because the refcount of the inode was 1.
    
    Step 5: The process A keep running, and call the function
    reconnect_path(in exportfs_decode_fh), which call function
    ocfs2_get_parent of ocfs2.  Get the block number of parent
    directory(patha) by the name of ...  Then read the data from disk by the
    block number.  But this inode has been deleted, so the system panic.
    
    Process A                                             Process B
    1. in nfsd3_proc_getacl                   |
    2.                                        |        dput
    3. fh_to_dentry(ocfs2_get_dentry)         |
    4. bdi flush dirty cache                  |
    5. ocfs2_iget                             |

    mm/mincore.c: make mincore() more conservative
    
    commit 134fca9063ad4851de767d1768180e5dede9a881 upstream.
    
    The semantics of what mincore() considers to be resident is not
    completely clear, but Linux has always (since 2.3.52, which is when
    mincore() was initially done) treated it as "page is available in page
    cache".
    
    That's potentially a problem, as that [in]directly exposes
    meta-information about pagecache / memory mapping state even about
    memory not strictly belonging to the process executing the syscall,
    opening possibilities for sidechannel attacks.
    
    Change the semantics of mincore() so that it only reveals pagecache
    information for non-anonymous mappings that belog to files that the
    calling process could (if it tried to) successfully open for writing;
    otherwise we'd be including shared non-exclusive mappings, which
    
     - is the sidechannel
    
     - is not the usecase for mincore(), as that's primarily used for data,
       not (shared) text

    ASoC: RT5677-SPI: Disable 16Bit SPI Transfers
    
    commit a46eb523220e242affb9a6bc9bb8efc05f4f7459 upstream.
    
    The current algorithm allows 3 types of transfers, 16bit, 32bit and
    burst. According to Realtek, 16bit transfers have a special restriction
    in that it is restricted to the memory region of
    0x18020000 ~ 0x18021000. This region is the memory location of the I2C
    registers. The current algorithm does not uphold this restriction and
    therefore fails to complete writes.
    
    Since this has been broken for some time it likely no one is using it.
    Better to simply disable the 16 bit writes. This will allow users to
    properly load firmware over SPI without data corruption.

    ASoC: max98090: Fix restore of DAPM Muxes
    
    commit ecb2795c08bc825ebd604997e5be440b060c5b18 upstream.
    
    The max98090 driver defines 3 DAPM muxes; one for the right line output
    (LINMOD Mux), one for the left headphone mixer source (MIXHPLSEL Mux)
    and one for the right headphone mixer source (MIXHPRSEL Mux). The same
    bit is used for the mux as well as the DAPM enable, and although the mux
    can be correctly configured, after playback has completed, the mux will
    be reset during the disable phase. This is preventing the state of these
    muxes from being saved and restored correctly on system reboot. Fix this
    by marking these muxes as SND_SOC_NOPM.
    
    Note this has been verified this on the Tegra124 Nyan Big which features
    the MAX98090 codec.

    ALSA: hda/hdmi - Consider eld_valid when reporting jack event
    
    commit 7f641e26a6df9269cb25dd7a4b0a91d6586ed441 upstream.
    
    On the machines with AMD GPU or Nvidia GPU, we often meet this issue:
    after s3, there are 4 HDMI/DP audio devices in the gnome-sound-setting
    even there is no any monitors plugged.
    
    When this problem happens, we check the /proc/asound/cardX/eld#N.M, we
    will find the monitor_present=1, eld_valid=0.
    
    The root cause is BIOS or GPU driver makes the PRESENCE valid even no
    monitor plugged, and of course the driver will not get the valid
    eld_data subsequently.
    
    In this situation, we should not report the jack_plugged event, to do
    so, let us change the function hdmi_present_sense_via_verbs(). In this
    function, it reads the pin_sense via snd_hda_pin_sense(), after
    calling this function, the jack_dirty is 0, and before exiting
    via_verbs(), we change the shadow pin_sense according to both
    monitor_present and eld_valid, then in the snd_hda_jack_report_sync(),
    since the jack_dirty is still 0, it will report jack event according
    to this modified shadow pin_sense.
    
    After this change, the driver will not report Jack_is_plugged event
    through hdmi_present_sense_via_verbs() if monitor_present is 1 and
    eld_valid is 0.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix a memory leak bug
    
    commit cb5173594d50c72b7bfa14113dfc5084b4d2f726 upstream.
    
    In parse_audio_selector_unit(), the string array 'namelist' is allocated
    through kmalloc_array(), and each string pointer in this array, i.e.,
    'namelist[]', is allocated through kmalloc() in the following for loop.
    Then, a control instance 'kctl' is created by invoking snd_ctl_new1(). If
    an error occurs during the creation process, the string array 'namelist',
    including all string pointers in the array 'namelist[]', should be freed,
    before the error code ENOMEM is returned. However, the current code does
    not free 'namelist[]', resulting in memory leaks.
    
    To fix the above issue, free all string pointers 'namelist[]' in a loop.

    crypto: x86/crct10dif-pcl - fix use via crypto_shash_digest()
    
    commit dec3d0b1071a0f3194e66a83d26ecf4aa8c5910e upstream.
    
    The ->digest() method of crct10dif-pclmul reads the current CRC value
    from the shash_desc context.  But this value is uninitialized, causing
    crypto_shash_digest() to compute the wrong result.  Fix it.
    
    Probably this wasn't noticed before because lib/crc-t10dif.c only uses
    crypto_shash_update(), not crypto_shash_digest().  Likewise,
    crypto_shash_digest() is not yet tested by the crypto self-tests because
    those only test the ahash API which only uses shash init/update/final.

    crypto: vmx - fix copy-paste error in CTR mode
    
    commit dcf7b48212c0fab7df69e84fab22d6cb7c8c0fb9 upstream.
    
    The original assembly imported from OpenSSL has two copy-paste
    errors in handling CTR mode. When dealing with a 2 or 3 block tail,
    the code branches to the CBC decryption exit path, rather than to
    the CTR exit path.
    
    This leads to corruption of the IV, which leads to subsequent blocks
    being corrupted.
    
    This can be detected with libkcapi test suite, which is available at
    https://github.com/smuellerDD/libkcapi
