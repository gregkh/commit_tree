    btrfs: check the right error variable in btrfs_del_dir_entries_in_log
    
    [ Upstream commit fb2fecbad50964b9f27a3b182e74e437b40753ef ]
    
    With my new locking code dbench is so much faster that I tripped over a
    transaction abort from ENOSPC.  This turned out to be because
    btrfs_del_dir_entries_in_log was checking for ret == -ENOSPC, but this
    function sets err on error, and returns err.  So instead of properly
    marking the inode as needing a full commit, we were returning -ENOSPC
    and aborting in __btrfs_unlink_inode.  Fix this by checking the proper
    variable so that we return the correct thing in the case of ENOSPC.
    
    The ENOENT needs to be checked, because btrfs_lookup_dir_item_index()
    can return -ENOENT if the dir item isn't in the tree log (which would
    happen if we hadn't fsync'ed this guy).  We actually handle that case in
    __btrfs_unlink_inode, so it's an expected error to get back.

    device property: Fix the secondary firmware node handling in set_primary_fwnode()

    When the primary firmware node pointer is removed from a
    device (set to NULL) the secondary firmware node pointer,
    when it exists, is made the primary node for the device.
    However, the secondary firmware node pointer of the original
    primary firmware node is never cleared (set to NULL).
    
    To avoid situation where the secondary firmware node pointer
    is pointing to a non-existing object, clearing it properly
    when the primary node is removed from a device in
    set_primary_fwnode().

    PM: sleep: core: Fix the handling of pending runtime resume requests
    
    commit e3eb6e8fba65094328b8dca635d00de74ba75b45 upstream.
    
    It has been reported that system-wide suspend may be aborted in the
    absence of any wakeup events due to unforseen interactions of it with
    the runtume PM framework.
    
    One failing scenario is when there are multiple devices sharing an
    ACPI power resource and runtime-resume needs to be carried out for
    one of them during system-wide suspend (for example, because it needs
    to be reconfigured before the whole system goes to sleep).  In that
    case, the runtime-resume of that device involves turning the ACPI
    power resource "on" which in turn causes runtime-resume requests
    to be queued up for all of the other devices sharing it.  Those
    requests go to the runtime PM workqueue which is frozen during
    system-wide suspend, so they are not actually taken care of until
    the resume of the whole system, but the pm_runtime_barrier()
    call in __device_suspend() sees them and triggers system wakeup
    events for them which then cause the system-wide suspend to be
    aborted if wakeup source objects are in active use.
    
    Of course, the logic that leads to triggering those wakeup events is
    questionable in the first place, because clearly there are cases in
    which a pending runtime resume request for a device is not connected
    to any real wakeup events in any way (like the one above).  Moreover,
    it is racy, because the device may be resuming already by the time
    the pm_runtime_barrier() runs and so if the driver doesn't take care
    of signaling the wakeup event as appropriate, it will be lost.
    However, if the driver does take care of that, the extra
    pm_wakeup_event() call in the core is redundant.
    
    Accordingly, drop the conditional pm_wakeup_event() call fron
    __device_suspend() and make the latter call pm_runtime_barrier()
    alone.  Also modify the comment next to that call to reflect the new
    code and extend it to mention the need to avoid unwanted interactions
    between runtime PM and system-wide device suspend callbacks.

    xhci: Do warm-reset when both CAS and XDEV_RESUME are set
    
    commit 904df64a5f4d5ebd670801d869ca0a6d6a6e8df6 upstream.
    
    Sometimes re-plugging a USB device during system sleep renders the device
    useless:
    [  173.418345] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: Get port status 2-4 read: 0x14203e2, return 0x10262

    [  176.497103] usb 2-4: can't resume, status -19
    [  176.497438] usb usb2-port4: logical disconnect
    
    Because PLS equals to XDEV_RESUME, xHCI driver reports U3 to usbcore,
    despite of CAS bit is flagged.
    
    So proritize CAS over XDEV_RESUME to let usbcore handle warm-reset for
    the port.

    XEN uses irqdesc::irq_data_common::handler_data to store a per interrupt XEN data pointer which contains XEN specific information.
    
    commit c330fb1ddc0a922f044989492b7fcca77ee1db46 upstream.
    
    handler data is meant for interrupt handlers and not for storing irq chip
    specific information as some devices require handler data to store internal
    per interrupt information, e.g. pinctrl/GPIO chained interrupt handlers.
    
    This obviously creates a conflict of interests and crashes the machine
    because the XEN pointer is overwritten by the driver pointer.
    
    As the XEN data is not handler specific it should be stored in
    irqdesc::irq_data::chip_data instead.
    
    A simple sed s/irq_[sg]et_handler_data/irq_[sg]et_chip_data/ cures that.

    commit f9cae926f35e8230330f28c7b743ad088611a8de upstream.
    
    When we are processing writeback for sync(2), move_expired_inodes()
    didn't set any inode expiry value (older_than_this). This can result in
    writeback never completing if there's steady stream of inodes added to
    b_dirty_time list as writeback rechecks dirty lists after each writeback
    round whether there's more work to be done. Fix the problem by using
    sync(2) start time is inode expiry value when processing b_dirty_time
    list similarly as for ordinarily dirtied inodes. This requires some
    refactoring of older_than_this handling which simplifies the code
    noticeably as a bonus.

    writeback: Avoid skipping inode writeback
    
    commit 5afced3bf28100d81fb2fe7e98918632a08feaf5 upstream.
    
    Inode's i_io_list list head is used to attach inode to several different
    lists - wb->{b_dirty, b_dirty_time, b_io, b_more_io}. When flush worker
    prepares a list of inodes to writeback e.g. for sync(2), it moves inodes
    to b_io list. Thus it is critical for sync(2) data integrity guarantees
    that inode is not requeued to any other writeback list when inode is
    queued for processing by flush worker. That's the reason why
    writeback_single_inode() does not touch i_io_list (unless the inode is
    completely clean) and why __mark_inode_dirty() does not touch i_io_list
    if I_SYNC flag is set.
    
    However there are two flaws in the current logic:
    
    1) When inode has only I_DIRTY_TIME set but it is already queued in b_io
    list due to sync(2), concurrent __mark_inode_dirty(inode, I_DIRTY_SYNC)
    can still move inode back to b_dirty list resulting in skipping
    writeback of inode time stamps during sync(2).
    
    2) When inode is on b_dirty_time list and writeback_single_inode() races
    with __mark_inode_dirty() like:
    
    writeback_single_inode()                __mark_inode_dirty(inode, I_DIRTY_PAGES)
      inode->i_state |= I_SYNC
      __writeback_single_inode()
                                              inode->i_state |= I_DIRTY_PAGES;
                                              if (inode->i_state & I_SYNC)
                                                bail
      if (!(inode->i_state & I_DIRTY_ALL))
      - not true so nothing done
    
    We end up with I_DIRTY_PAGES inode on b_dirty_time list and thus
    standard background writeback will not writeback this inode leading to
    possible dirty throttling stalls etc. (thanks to Martijn Coenen for this
    analysis).
    
    Fix these problems by tracking whether inode is queued in b_io or
    b_more_io lists in a new I_SYNC_QUEUED flag. When this flag is set, we
    know flush worker has queued inode and we should not touch i_io_list.
    On the other hand we also know that once flush worker is done with the
    inode it will requeue the inode to appropriate dirty list. When
    I_SYNC_QUEUED is not set, __mark_inode_dirty() can (and must) move inode
    to appropriate dirty list.

    writeback: Protect inode->i_io_list with inode->i_lock
    
    commit b35250c0816c7cf7d0a8de92f5fafb6a7508a708 upstream.
    
    Currently, operations on inode->i_io_list are protected by
    wb->list_lock. In the following patches we'll need to maintain
    consistency between inode->i_state and inode->i_io_list so change the
    code so that inode->i_lock protects also all inode's i_io_list handling.

    serial: 8250: change lock order in serial8250_do_startup()
    
    commit 205d300aea75623e1ae4aa43e0d265ab9cf195fd upstream.
    
    We have a number of "uart.port->desc.lock vs desc.lock->uart.port"
    lockdep reports coming from 8250 driver; this causes a bit of trouble
    to people, so let's fix it.
    
    The problem is reverse lock order in two different call paths:
    
    chain #1:
    
     serial8250_do_startup()
      spin_lock_irqsave(&port->lock);
       disable_irq_nosync(port->irq);
        raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&desc->lock)
    
    chain #2:
    
      __report_bad_irq()
       raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&desc->lock)
        for_each_action_of_desc()
         printk()
          spin_lock_irqsave(&port->lock);
    
    Fix this by changing the order of locks in serial8250_do_startup():
     do disable_irq_nosync() first, which grabs desc->lock, and grab
     uart->port after that, so that chain #1 and chain #2 have same lock
     order.
    
    Full lockdep splat:

    serial: pl011: Don't leak amba_ports entry on driver register error
    
    commit 89efbe70b27dd325d8a8c177743a26b885f7faec upstream.
    
    pl011_probe() calls pl011_setup_port() to reserve an amba_ports[] entry,
    then calls pl011_register_port() to register the uart driver with the
    tty layer.
    
    If registration of the uart driver fails, the amba_ports[] entry is not
    released.  If this happens 14 times (value of UART_NR macro), then all
    amba_ports[] entries will have been leaked and driver probing is no
    longer possible.  (To be fair, that can only happen if the DeviceTree
    doesn't contain alias IDs since they cause the same entry to be used for
    a given port.)   Fix it.

    serial: samsung: Removes the IRQ not found warning
    
    commit 8c6c378b0cbe0c9f1390986b5f8ffb5f6ff7593b upstream.
    
    In few older Samsung SoCs like s3c2410, s3c2412
    and s3c2440, UART IP is having 2 interrupt lines.
    However, in other SoCs like s3c6400, s5pv210,
    exynos5433, and exynos4210 UART is having only 1
    interrupt line. Due to this, "platform_get_irq(platdev, 1)"
    call in the driver gives the following false-positive error:
    "IRQ index 1 not found" on newer SoC's.
    
    This patch adds the condition to check for Tx interrupt
    only for the those SoC's which have 2 interrupt lines.

    vt: defer kfree() of vc_screenbuf in vc_do_resize()
    
    commit f8d1653daec02315e06d30246cff4af72e76e54e upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting UAF bug in set_origin() from vc_do_resize() [1], for
    vc_do_resize() calls kfree(vc->vc_screenbuf) before calling set_origin().
    
    Unfortunately, in set_origin(), vc->vc_sw->con_set_origin() might access
    vc->vc_pos when scroll is involved in order to manipulate cursor, but
    vc->vc_pos refers already released vc->vc_screenbuf until vc->vc_pos gets
    updated based on the result of vc->vc_sw->con_set_origin().
    
    Preserving old buffer and tolerating outdated vc members until set_origin()
    completes would be easier than preventing vc->vc_sw->con_set_origin() from
    accessing outdated vc members.

    fbcon: prevent user font height or width change from causing potential out-of-bounds access
    
    commit 39b3cffb8cf3111738ea993e2757ab382253d86a upstream.
    
    Add a check to fbcon_resize() to ensure that a possible change to user font
    height or user font width will not allow a font data out-of-bounds access.
    NOTE: must use original charcount in calculation as font charcount can
    change and cannot be used to determine the font data allocated size.

    net: gianfar: Add of_node_put() before goto statement
    
    [ Upstream commit 989e4da042ca4a56bbaca9223d1a93639ad11e17 ]
    
    Every iteration of for_each_available_child_of_node() decrements
    reference count of the previous node, however when control
    is transferred from the middle of the loop, as in the case of
    a return or break or goto, there is no decrement thus ultimately
    resulting in a memory leak.
    
    Fix a potential memory leak in gianfar.c by inserting of_node_put()
    before the goto statement.

    scsi: ufs: Fix possible infinite loop in ufshcd_hold
    
    [ Upstream commit 93b6c5db06028a3b55122bbb74d0715dd8ca4ae0 ]
    
    In ufshcd_suspend(), after clk-gating is suspended and link is set
    as Hibern8 state, ufshcd_hold() is still possibly invoked before
    ufshcd_suspend() returns. For example, MediaTek's suspend vops may
    issue UIC commands which would call ufshcd_hold() during the command
    issuing flow.
    
    Now if UFSHCD_CAP_HIBERN8_WITH_CLK_GATING capability is enabled,
    then ufshcd_hold() may enter infinite loops because there is no
    clk-ungating work scheduled or pending. In this case, ufshcd_hold()
    shall just bypass, and keep the link as Hibern8 state.

    The scanning through subchannels during the time of an event could

    known subchannels. This might result in higher scheduling latencies
    for other tasks especially on systems with a single CPU. Add

    [ Upstream commit c044f3d8360d2ecf831ba2cc9f08cf9fb2c699fb ]
    
    If we free a metadata buffer which has been failed to async write out
    in the background, the jbd2 checkpoint procedure will not detect this
    failure in jbd2_log_do_checkpoint(), so it may lead to filesystem
    inconsistency after cleanup journal tail. This patch abort the journal

    [ Upstream commit 24dc9864914eb5813173cfa53313fcd02e4aea7d ]
    
    Callers of __jbd2_journal_unfile_buffer() and
    __jbd2_journal_refile_buffer() assume that the b_transaction is set. In
    fact if it's not, we can end up with journal_head refcounting errors
    leading to crash much later that might be very hard to track down. Add
    asserts to make sure that is the case.
    
    We also make sure that b_next_transaction is NULL in
    __jbd2_journal_unfile_buffer() since the callers expect that as well and
    we should not get into that stage in this state anyway, leading to
    problems later on if we do.

    [ Upstream commit a1769bb68a850508a492e3674ab1e5e479b11254 ]
    
    This reverts commit 76d164f582150fd0259ec0fcbc485470bcd8033e.
    PCIe hung issue was observed on multiple platforms. The issue was reproduced
    when DUT was configured as AP and associated with 50+ STAs.
    
    For QCA9984/QCA9888, the DMA_BURST_SIZE register controls the AXI burst size
    of the RD/WR access to the HOST MEM.
    0 - No split , RAW read/write transfer size from MAC is put out on bus
        as burst length
    1 - Split at 256 byte boundary
    2,3 - Reserved
    
    With PCIe protocol analyzer, we can see DMA Read crossing 4KB boundary when
    issue happened. It broke PCIe spec and caused PCIe stuck. So revert
    the default value from 0 to 1.
    
    Tested:  IPQ8064 + QCA9984 with firmware 10.4-3.10-00047
             QCS404 + QCA9984 with firmware 10.4-3.9.0.2--00044

    The char buffer buf, receives data directly from user space,

    The Intel uncore driver may claim some of the pci ids from ie31200 which
    means that the ie31200 edac driver will not initialize them as part of
    pci_register_driver().
    
    Let's add a fallback for this case to 'pci_get_device()' to get a
    reference on the device such that it can still be configured. This is
    similar in approach to other edac drivers.

    ceph: fix potential mdsc use-after-free crash
    
    [ Upstream commit fa9967734227b44acb1b6918033f9122dc7825b9 ]
    
    Make sure the delayed work stopped before releasing the resources.
    
    cancel_delayed_work_sync() will only guarantee that the work finishes
    executing if the work is already in the ->worklist.  That means after
    the cancel_delayed_work_sync() returns, it will leave the work requeued
    if it was rearmed at the end. That can lead to a use after free once the
    work struct is freed.
    
    Fix it by flushing the delayed work instead of trying to cancel it, and
    ensure that the work doesn't rearm if the mdsc is stopping.

    selftests/powerpc: Purge extra count_pmc() calls of ebb selftests
    
    [ Upstream commit 3337bf41e0dd70b4064cdf60acdfcdc2d050066c ]
    
    An extra count on ebb_state.stats.pmc_count[PMC_INDEX(pmc)] is being per-
    formed when count_pmc() is used to reset PMCs on a few selftests. This
    extra pmc_count can occasionally invalidate results, such as the ones from
    cycles_test shown hereafter. The ebb_check_count() failed with an above
    the upper limit error due to the extra value on ebb_state.stats.pmc_count.
    
    Furthermore, this extra count is also indicated by extra PMC1 trace_log on
    the output of the cycle test (as well as on pmc56_overflow_test):

    scsi: lpfc: Fix shost refcount mismatch when deleting vport
    
    [ Upstream commit 03dbfe0668e6692917ac278883e0586cd7f7d753 ]
    
    When vports are deleted, it is observed that there is memory/kthread
    leakage as the vport isn't fully being released.
    
    There is a shost reference taken in scsi_add_host_dma that is not released
    during scsi_remove_host. It was noticed that other drivers resolve this by
    doing a scsi_host_put after calling scsi_remove_host.
    
    The vport_delete routine is taking two references one that corresponds to
    an access to the scsi_host in the vport_delete routine and another that is
    released after the adapter mailbox command completes that destroys the VPI
    that corresponds to the vport.
    
    Remove one of the references taken such that the second reference that is
    put will complete the missing scsi_add_host_dma reference and the shost
    will be terminated.

    scsi: target: tcmu: Fix crash on ARM during cmd completion
    
    [ Upstream commit 5a0c256d96f020e4771f6fd5524b80f89a2d3132 ]
    
    If tcmu_handle_completions() has to process a padding shorter than
    sizeof(struct tcmu_cmd_entry), the current call to
    tcmu_flush_dcache_range() with sizeof(struct tcmu_cmd_entry) as length
    param is wrong and causes crashes on e.g. ARM, because
    tcmu_flush_dcache_range() in this case calls
    flush_dcache_page(vmalloc_to_page(start)); with start being an invalid
    address above the end of the vmalloc'ed area.
    
    The fix is to use the minimum of remaining ring space and sizeof(struct
    tcmu_cmd_entry) as the length param.
    
    The patch was tested on kernel 4.19.118.

    [ Upstream commit 6499a0db9b0f1e903d52f8244eacc1d4be00eea2 ]
    
    The value av7110->debi_virt is stored in DMA memory, and it is assigned
    to data, and thus data[0] can be modified at any time by malicious
    hardware. In this case, "if (data[0] < 2)" can be passed, but then
    data[0] can be changed into a large number, which may cause buffer
    overflow when the code "av7110->ci_slot[data[0]]" is used.
    
    To fix this possible bug, data[0] is assigned to a local variable, which
    replaces the use of data[0].

    powerpc/pseries: Do not initiate shutdown when system is running on UPS
    
    commit 90a9b102eddf6a3f987d15f4454e26a2532c1c98 upstream.
    
    As per PAPR we have to look for both EPOW sensor value and event
    modifier to identify the type of event and take appropriate action.
    
    In LoPAPR v1.1 section 10.2.2 includes table 136 "EPOW Action Codes":
    
      SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN 3
    
      The system must be shut down. An EPOW-aware OS logs the EPOW error
      log information, then schedules the system to be shut down to begin
      after an OS defined delay internal (default is 10 minutes.)
    
    Then in section 10.3.2.2.8 there is table 146 "Platform Event Log
    Format, Version 6, EPOW Section", which includes the "EPOW Event
    Modifier":
    
      For EPOW sensor value = 3
      0x01 = Normal system shutdown with no additional delay
      0x02 = Loss of utility power, system is running on UPS/Battery
      0x03 = Loss of system critical functions, system should be shutdown
      0x04 = Ambient temperature too high
      All other values = reserved
    
    We have a user space tool (rtas_errd) on LPAR to monitor for
    EPOW_SHUTDOWN_ON_UPS. Once it gets an event it initiates shutdown
    after predefined time. It also starts monitoring for any new EPOW
    events. If it receives "Power restored" event before predefined time
    it will cancel the shutdown. Otherwise after predefined time it will
    shutdown the system.
    
    Commit 79872e35469b ("powerpc/pseries: All events of
    EPOW_SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN must initiate shutdown") changed our handling of
    the "on UPS/Battery" case, to immediately shutdown the system. This
    breaks existing setups that rely on the userspace tool to delay
    shutdown and let the system run on the UPS.
    
    Fixes: 79872e35469b ("powerpc/pseries: All events of EPOW_SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN must initiate shutdown")

    bonding: fix a potential double-unregister
    
    [ Upstream commit 832707021666411d04795c564a4adea5d6b94f17 ]
    
    When we tear down a network namespace, we unregister all
    the netdevices within it. So we may queue a slave device
    and a bonding device together in the same unregister queue.
    
    If the only slave device is non-ethernet, it would
    automatically unregister the bonding device as well. Thus,
    we may end up unregistering the bonding device twice.
    
    Workaround this special case by checking reg_state.
    
    Fixes: 9b5e383c11b0 ("net: Introduce unregister_netdevice_many()")

    [ Upstream commit 4ca0d9ac3fd8f9f90b72a15d8da2aca3ffb58418 ]
    
    Broadcast mode bonds transmit a copy of all traffic simultaneously out of
    all interfaces, so the "speed" of the bond isn't really the aggregate of
    all interfaces, but rather, the speed of the slowest active interface.
    
    Also, the type of the speed field is u32, not unsigned long, so adjust
    that accordingly, as required to make min() function here without
    complaining about mismatching types.

    tipc: fix uninit skb->data in tipc_nl_compat_dumpit()
    
    [ Upstream commit 47733f9daf4fe4f7e0eb9e273f21ad3a19130487 ]
    
    __tipc_nl_compat_dumpit() has two callers, and it expects them to
    pass a valid nlmsghdr via arg->data. This header is artificial and
    crafted just for __tipc_nl_compat_dumpit().
    
    tipc_nl_compat_publ_dump() does so by putting a genlmsghdr as well
    as some nested attribute, TIPC_NLA_SOCK. But the other caller
    tipc_nl_compat_dumpit() does not, this leaves arg->data uninitialized
    on this call path.
    
    Fix this by just adding a similar nlmsghdr without any payload in
    tipc_nl_compat_dumpit().
    
    This bug exists since day 1, but the recent commit 6ea67769ff33
    ("net: tipc: prepare attrs in __tipc_nl_compat_dumpit()") makes it
    easier to appear.

    net: Fix potential wrong skb->protocol in skb_vlan_untag()
    
    [ Upstream commit 55eff0eb7460c3d50716ed9eccf22257b046ca92 ]
    
    We may access the two bytes after vlan_hdr in vlan_set_encap_proto(). So
    we should pull VLAN_HLEN + sizeof(unsigned short) in skb_vlan_untag() or
    we may access the wrong data.
