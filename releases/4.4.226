    scsi: zfcp: fix request object use-after-free in send path causing wrong traces
    
    [ Upstream commit 106d45f350c7cac876844dc685845cba4ffdb70b ]
    
    When tracing instances where we open and close WKA ports, we also pass the
    request-ID of the respective FSF command.
    
    But after successfully sending the FSF command we must not use the
    request-object anymore, as this might result in an use-after-free (see
    "zfcp: fix request object use-after-free in send path causing seqno
    errors" ).
    
    To fix this add a new variable that caches the request-ID before sending
    the request. This won't change during the hand-off to the FCP channel,
    and so it's safe to trace this cached request-ID later, instead of using
    the request object.

    printk: help pr_debug and pr_devel to optimize out arguments
    
    [ Upstream commit fe22cd9b7c980b8b948ec85f034a8668c57ec867 ]
    
    Currently, pr_debug and pr_devel will not elide function call arguments
    appearing in calls to the no_printk for these macros.  This is because
    all side effects must be honored before proceeding to the 0-value
    assignment in no_printk.
    
    The behavior is contrary to documentation found in the CodingStyle and
    the header file where these functions are declared.
    
    This patch corrects that behavior by shunting out the call to no_printk
    completely.  The format string is still checked by gcc for correctness,
    but no code seems to be emitted in common cases.

    drm/msm: Fix possible null dereference on failure of get_pages()
    
    commit 3976626ea3d2011f8fd3f3a47070a8b792018253 upstream.
    
    Commit 62e3a3e342af changed get_pages() to initialise
    msm_gem_object::pages before trying to initialise msm_gem_object::sgt,
    so that put_pages() would properly clean up pages in the failure
    case.
    
    However, this means that put_pages() now needs to check that
    msm_gem_object::sgt is not null before trying to clean it up, and
    this check was only applied to part of the cleanup code.  Move
    it all into the conditional block.  (Strictly speaking we don't
    need to make the kfree() conditional, but since we can't avoid
    checking for null ourselves we may as well do so.)

    genirq/generic_pending: Do not lose pending affinity update
    
    commit a33a5d2d16cb84bea8d5f5510f3a41aa48b5c467 upstream.
    
    The generic pending interrupt mechanism moves interrupts from the interrupt
    handler on the original target CPU to the new destination CPU. This is
    required for x86 and ia64 due to the way the interrupt delivery and
    acknowledge works if the interrupts are not remapped.
    
    However that update can fail for various reasons. Some of them are valid
    reasons to discard the pending update, but the case, when the previous move
    has not been fully cleaned up is not a legit reason to fail.
    
    Check the return value of irq_do_set_affinity() for -EBUSY, which indicates
    a pending cleanup, and rearm the pending move in the irq dexcriptor so it's
    tried again when the next interrupt arrives.

    drm/fb-helper: Use proper plane mask for fb cleanup
    
    commit 7118fd9bd975a9f3093239d4c0f4e15356b57fab upstream.
    
    pan_display_atomic() calls drm_atomic_clean_old_fb() to sanitize the
    legacy FB fields (plane->fb and plane->old_fb).  However it was building
    the plane mask to pass to this function incorrectly (the bitwise OR was
    using plane indices rather than plane masks).  The end result was that
    sometimes the legacy pointers would become out of sync with the atomic
    pointers.  If another operation tried to re-set the same FB onto the
    plane, we might end up with the pointers back in sync, but improper
    reference counts, which would eventually lead to system crashes when we
    accessed a pointer to a prematurely-destroyed FB.
    
    The cause here was a very subtle bug introduced in commit:
    
            commit 07d3bad6c1210bd21e85d084807ef4ee4ac43a78

                drm/core: Fix old_fb handling in pan_display_atomic.
    
    I found the crashes were most easily reproduced (on i915 at least) by
    starting X and then VT switching to a VT that wasn't running a console
    instance...the sequence of vt/fbcon entries that happen in that case
    trigger a reference count mismatch and crash the system.

    mm: remove VM_BUG_ON(PageSlab()) from page_mapcount()
    
    commit 6988f31d558aa8c744464a7f6d91d34ada48ad12 upstream.
    
    Replace superfluous VM_BUG_ON() with comment about correct usage.
    
    Technically reverts commit 1d148e218a0d ("mm: add VM_BUG_ON_PAGE() to
    page_mapcount()"), but context lines have changed.
    
    Function isolate_migratepages_block() runs some checks out of lru_lock
    when choose pages for migration.  After checking PageLRU() it checks
    extra page references by comparing page_count() and page_mapcount().
    Between these two checks page could be removed from lru, freed and taken
    by slab.
    
    As a result this race triggers VM_BUG_ON(PageSlab()) in page_mapcount().
    Race window is tiny.  For certain workload this happens around once a
    year.

    kobject_init_and_add() takes reference even when it fails.
    If this function returns an error, kobject_put() must be called to
    properly clean up the memory associated with the object. Previous

    ip_vti: receive ipip packet by calling ip_tunnel_rcv
    
    commit 976eba8ab596bab94b9714cd46d38d5c6a2c660d upstream.
    
    In Commit dd9ee3444014 ("vti4: Fix a ipip packet processing bug in
    'IPCOMP' virtual tunnel"), it tries to receive IPIP packets in vti
    by calling xfrm_input(). This case happens when a small packet or
    frag sent by peer is too small to get compressed.
    
    However, xfrm_input() will still get to the IPCOMP path where skb
    sec_path is set, but never dropped while it should have been done
    in vti_ipcomp4_protocol.cb_handler(vti_rcv_cb), as it's not an
    ipcomp4 packet. This will cause that the packet can never pass
    xfrm4_policy_check() in the upper protocol rcv functions.
    
    So this patch is to call ip_tunnel_rcv() to process IPIP packets
    instead.

    commit f6a23d85d078c2ffde79c66ca81d0a1dde451649 upstream.
    
    This patch is to fix a crash:

    This occurred when sending a v4 skb over vxlan6 over ipsec, in which case
    skb->protocol == htons(ETH_P_IPV6) while skb->sk->sk_family == AF_INET in
    xfrm_local_error(). Then it will go to xfrm6_local_error() where it tries
    to get ipv6 info from a ipv4 sk.
    
    This issue was actually fixed by Commit 628e341f319f ("xfrm: make local
    error reporting more robust"), but brought back by Commit 844d48746e4b
    ("xfrm: choose protocol family by skb protocol").
    
    So to fix it, we should call xfrm6_local_error() only when skb->protocol
    is htons(ETH_P_IPV6) and skb->sk->sk_family is AF_INET6.

    The issue was introduced by Commit 7cb8a93968e3 ("xfrm: Allow inserting
    policies with matching mark and different priorities"). After that, the
    policies [1] and [2] would be able to be added with different priorities.
    
    However, policy [3] will actually match both [1] and [2]. Policy [1]
    was matched due to the 1st 'return true' in xfrm_policy_mark_match(),
    and policy [2] was matched due to the 2nd 'return true' in there. It
    caused WARN_ON() in xfrm_policy_insert_list().
    
    This patch is to fix it by only (the same value and priority) as the
    same policy in xfrm_policy_mark_match().
    
    Thanks to Yuehaibing, we could make this fix better.
    
    v1->v2:
      - check policy->mark.v == pol->mark.v only without mask.

    xfrm: allow to accept packets with ipv6 NEXTHDR_HOP in xfrm_input
    
    commit afcaf61be9d1dbdee5ec186d1dcc67b6b692180f upstream.
    
    For beet mode, when it's ipv6 inner address with nexthdrs set,
    the packet format might be:
    
        ----------------------------------------------------
        | outer  |     | dest |     |      |  ESP    | ESP |
        | IP hdr | ESP | opts.| TCP | Data | Trailer | ICV |
        ----------------------------------------------------
    
    The nexthdr from ESP could be NEXTHDR_HOP(0), so it should
    continue processing the packet when nexthdr returns 0 in
    xfrm_input(). Otherwise, when ipv6 nexthdr is set, the
    packet will be dropped.
    
    I don't see any error cases that nexthdr may return 0. So
    fix it by removing the check for nexthdr == 0.

    x86/dma: Fix max PFN arithmetic overflow on 32 bit systems
    
    commit 88743470668ef5eb6b7ba9e0f99888e5999bf172 upstream.
    
    The intermediate result of the old term (4UL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024) is
    4 294 967 296 or 0x100000000 which is no problem on 64 bit systems.
    The patch does not change the later overall result of 0x100000 for
    MAX_DMA32_PFN (after it has been shifted by PAGE_SHIFT). The new
    calculation yields the same result, but does not require 64 bit
    arithmetic.
    
    On 32 bit systems the old calculation suffers from an arithmetic
    overflow in that intermediate term in braces: 4UL aka unsigned long int
    is 4 byte wide and an arithmetic overflow happens (the 0x100000000 does
    not fit in 4 bytes), the in braces result is truncated to zero, the
    following right shift does not alter that, so MAX_DMA32_PFN evaluates to
    0 on 32 bit systems.
    
    That wrong value is a problem in a comparision against MAX_DMA32_PFN in
    the init code for swiotlb in pci_swiotlb_detect_4gb() to decide if
    swiotlb should be active.  That comparison yields the opposite result,
    when compiling on 32 bit systems.
    
    This was not possible before
    
      1b7e03ef7570 ("x86, NUMA: Enable emulation on 32bit too")
    
    when that MAX_DMA32_PFN was first made visible to x86_32 (and which
    landed in v3.0).
    
    In practice this wasn't a problem, unless CONFIG_SWIOTLB is active on
    x86-32.
    
    However if one has set CONFIG_IOMMU_INTEL, since
    
      c5a5dc4cbbf4 ("iommu/vt-d: Don't switch off swiotlb if bounce page is used")
    
    there's a dependency on CONFIG_SWIOTLB, which was not necessarily
    active before. That landed in v5.4, where we noticed it in the fli4l
    Linux distribution. We have CONFIG_IOMMU_INTEL active on both 32 and 64
    bit kernel configs there (I could not find out why, so let's just say
    historical reasons).
    
    The effect is at boot time 64 MiB (default size) were allocated for
    bounce buffers now, which is a noticeable amount of memory on small
    systems like pcengines ALIX 2D3 with 256 MiB memory, which are still
    frequently used as home routers.
    
    We noticed this effect when migrating from kernel v4.19 (LTS) to v5.4
    (LTS) in fli4l and got that kernel messages for example:
    
      Linux version 5.4.22 (buildroot@buildroot) (gcc version 7.3.0 (Buildroot 2018.02.8)) #1 SMP Mon Nov 26 23:40:00 CET 2018
      …
      Memory: 183484K/261756K available (4594K kernel code, 393K rwdata, 1660K rodata, 536K init, 456K bss , 78272K reserved, 0K cma-reserved, 0K highmem)
      …
      PCI-DMA: Using software bounce buffering for IO (SWIOTLB)
      software IO TLB: mapped [mem 0x0bb78000-0x0fb78000] (64MB)
    
    The initial analysis and the suggested fix was done by user 'sourcejedi'
    at stackoverflow and explicitly marked as GPLv2 for inclusion in the
    Linux kernel:
    
      https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/520525/50007
    
    The new calculation, which does not suffer from that overflow, is the
    same as for arch/mips now as suggested by Robin Murphy.
    
    The fix was tested by fli4l users on round about two dozen different
    systems, including both 32 and 64 bit archs, bare metal and virtualized
    machines.

    exec: Always set cap_ambient in cap_bprm_set_creds
    
    [ Upstream commit a4ae32c71fe90794127b32d26d7ad795813b502e ]
    
    An invariant of cap_bprm_set_creds is that every field in the new cred
    structure that cap_bprm_set_creds might set, needs to be set every
    time to ensure the fields does not get a stale value.
    
    The field cap_ambient is not set every time cap_bprm_set_creds is
    called, which means that if there is a suid or sgid script with an
    interpreter that has neither the suid nor the sgid bits set the
    interpreter should be able to accept ambient credentials.
    Unfortuantely because cap_ambient is not reset to it's original value
    the interpreter can not accept ambient credentials.
    
    Given that the ambient capability set is expected to be controlled by
    the caller, I don't think this is particularly serious.  But it is
    definitely worth fixing so the code works correctly.
    
    I have tested to verify my reading of the code is correct and the
    interpreter of a sgid can receive ambient capabilities with this
    change and cannot receive ambient capabilities without this change.

    When kobject_init_and_add() returns an error in the function
    qib_create_port_files(), the function kobject_put() is not called for the

    This patch fixes the issue by calling kobject_put() even if
    kobject_init_and_add() fails. In addition, the ppd->diagc_kobj is released
    along with other kobjects when the sysfs is unregistered.

    Input: i8042 - add ThinkPad S230u to i8042 reset list
    
    [ Upstream commit 2712c91a54a1058d55c284152b4d93c979b67be6 ]
    
    On the Lenovo ThinkPad Twist S230u (3347-4HU) with BIOS version
    "GDETC1WW (1.81 ) 06/27/2019", the keyboard, Synaptics TouchPad, and
    TrackPoint either do not function or stop functioning a few minutes
    after boot.  This problem has been noted before, perhaps only occurring
    with BIOS 1.57 and later.[1][2][3][4][5]
    
    Odds of a BIOS fix appear to be low: 1.57 was released over 6 years ago
    and although the [BIOS changelog] notes "Fixed an issue of UEFI
    touchpad/trackpoint/keyboard/touchscreen" in 1.58, it appears to be
    insufficient.
    
    Setting i8042.reset=1 or adding 33474HU to the reset list avoids the
    issue on my system from either warm or cold boot.

    cachefiles: Fix race between read_waiter and read_copier involving op->to_do
    
    [ Upstream commit 7bb0c5338436dae953622470d52689265867f032 ]
    
    There is a potential race in fscache operation enqueuing for reading and
    copying multiple pages from cachefiles to netfs.  The problem can be seen
    easily on a heavy loaded system (for example many processes reading files
    continually on an NFS share covered by fscache triggered this problem within
    a few minutes).
    
    The race is due to cachefiles_read_waiter() adding the op to the monitor
    to_do list and then then drop the object->work_lock spinlock before
    completing fscache_enqueue_operation().  Once the lock is dropped,
    cachefiles_read_copier() grabs the op, completes processing it, and
    makes it through fscache_retrieval_complete() which sets the op->state to
    the final state of FSCACHE_OP_ST_COMPLETE(4).  When cachefiles_read_waiter()
    finally gets through the remainder of fscache_enqueue_operation()
    it sees the invalid state, and hits the ASSERTCMP and the following
    oops is seen:
    [ 2259.612361] FS-Cache:

    IB/cma: Fix reference count leak when no ipv4 addresses are set
    
    commit 963916fdb3e5ad4af57ac959b5a03bf23f7568ca upstream.
    
    Once in_dev_get is called to receive in_device pointer, the
    in_device reference counter is increased, but if there are
    no ipv4 addresses configured on the net-device the ifa_list
    will be null, resulting in a flow that doesn't call in_dev_put
    to decrease the ref_cnt.
    This was exposed when running RoCE over ipv6 without any ipv4
    addresses configured

    uapi: fix linux/if_pppol2tp.h userspace compilation errors
    
    commit a725eb15db80643a160310ed6bcfd6c5a6c907f2 upstream.
    
    Because of <linux/libc-compat.h> interface limitations, <netinet/in.h>
    provided by libc cannot be included after <linux/in.h>, therefore any
    header that includes <netinet/in.h> cannot be included after <linux/in.h>.
    
    Change uapi/linux/l2tp.h, the last uapi header that includes
    <netinet/in.h>, to include <linux/in.h> and <linux/in6.h> instead of
    <netinet/in.h> and use __SOCK_SIZE__ instead of sizeof(struct sockaddr)
    the same way as uapi/linux/in.h does, to fix linux/if_pppol2tp.h userspace
    compilation errors like this:
    
    In file included from /usr/include/linux/l2tp.h:12:0,

    net/mlx5: Add command entry handling completion
    
    [ Upstream commit 17d00e839d3b592da9659c1977d45f85b77f986a ]
    
    When FW response to commands is very slow and all command entries in
    use are waiting for completion we can have a race where commands can get
    timeout before they get out of the queue and handled. Timeout
    completion on uninitialized command will cause releasing command's
    buffers before accessing it for initialization and then we will get NULL
    pointer exception while trying access it. It may also cause releasing
    buffers of another command since we may have timeout completion before
    even allocating entry index for this command.
    Add entry handling completion to avoid this race.

    sctp: Start shutdown on association restart if in SHUTDOWN-SENT state and socket is closed
    
    [ Upstream commit d3e8e4c11870413789f029a71e72ae6e971fe678 ]
    
    Commit bdf6fa52f01b ("sctp: handle association restarts when the
    socket is closed.") starts shutdown when an association is restarted,
    if in SHUTDOWN-PENDING state and the socket is closed. However, the
    rationale stated in that commit applies also when in SHUTDOWN-SENT
    state - we don't want to move an association to ESTABLISHED state when
    the socket has been closed, because that results in an association
    that is unreachable from user space.
    
    The problem scenario:
    
    1.  Client crashes and/or restarts.
    
    2.  Server (using one-to-one socket) calls close(). SHUTDOWN is lost.
    
    3.  Client reconnects using the same addresses and ports.
    
    4.  Server's association is restarted. The association and the socket
        move to ESTABLISHED state, even though the server process has
        closed its descriptor.
    
    Also, after step 4 when the server process exits, some resources are
    leaked in an attempt to release the underlying inet sock structure in
    ESTABLISHED state:
    
        IPv4: Attempt to release TCP socket in state 1 00000000377288c7
    
    Fix by acting the same way as in SHUTDOWN-PENDING state. That is, if
    an association is restarted in SHUTDOWN-SENT state and the socket is
    closed, then start shutdown and don't move the association or the
    socket to ESTABLISHED state.

    net: revert "net: get rid of an signed integer overflow in ip_idents_reserve()"
    
    [ Upstream commit a6211caa634da39d861a47437ffcda8b38ef421b ]
    
    Commit adb03115f459 ("net: get rid of an signed integer overflow in ip_idents_reserve()")
    used atomic_cmpxchg to replace "atomic_add_return" inside the function
    "ip_idents_reserve". The reason was to avoid UBSAN warning.
    However, this change has caused performance degrade and in GCC-8,
    fno-strict-overflow is now mapped to -fwrapv -fwrapv-pointer
    and signed integer overflow is now undefined by default at all
    optimization levels[1]. Moreover, it was a bug in UBSAN vs -fwrapv
    /-fno-strict-overflow, so Let's revert it safely.
