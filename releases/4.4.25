    tpm_crb: fix crb_req_canceled behavior
    
    commit 72fd50e14e46dc0edf360631bdece87c2f066a97 upstream.
    
    The req_canceled() callback is used by tpm_transmit() periodically to
    check whether the request has been canceled while it is receiving a
    response from the TPM.
    
    The TPM_CRB_CTRL_CANCEL register was cleared already in the crb_cancel
    callback, which has two consequences:
    
    * Cancel might not happen.
    * req_canceled() always returns zero.
    
    A better place to clear the register is when starting to send a new
    command. The behavior of TPM_CRB_CTRL_CANCEL is described in the
    section 5.5.3.6 of the PTP specification.

    ARM: dts: MSM8064 remove flags from SPMI/MPP IRQs
    
    commit ca88696e8b73a9fa2b1de445747e9235c3a7bd50 upstream.
    
    The Qualcomm PMIC GPIO and MPP lines are problematic: the
    are fetched from the main MFD driver with platform_get_irq()
    which means that at this point they will all be assigned the
    flags set up for the interrupts in the device tree.
    
    That is problematic since these are flagged as rising edge
    and an this point the interrupt descriptor is assigned a
    rising edge, while the only thing the GPIO/MPP drivers really
    do is issue irq_get_irqchip_state() on the line to read it
    out and to provide a .to_irq() helper for *other* IRQ
    consumers.
    
    If another device tree node tries to flag the same IRQ
    for use as something else than rising edge, the kernel
    irqdomain core will protest like this:
    
      type mismatch, failed to map hwirq-NN for <FOO>!
    
    Which is what happens when the device tree defines two
    contradictory flags for the same interrupt line.
    
    To work around this and alleviate the problem, assign 0
    as flag for the interrupts taken by the PM GPIO and MPP
    drivers. This will lead to the flag being unset, and a
    second consumer requesting rising, falling, both or level
    interrupts will be respected. This is what the qcom-pm*.dtsi
    files already do.
    
    Switched to using the symbolic name IRQ_TYPE_NONE so that
    we get this more readable.

    x86/dumpstack: Fix x86_32 kernel_stack_pointer() previous stack access
    
    commit 72b4f6a5e903b071f2a7c4eb1418cbe4eefdc344 upstream.
    
    On x86_32, when an interrupt happens from kernel space, SS and SP aren't
    pushed and the existing stack is used.  So pt_regs is effectively two
    words shorter, and the previous stack pointer is normally the memory
    after the shortened pt_regs, aka '&regs->sp'.
    
    But in the rare case where the interrupt hits right after the stack
    pointer has been changed to point to an empty stack, like for example
    when call_on_stack() is used, the address immediately after the
    shortened pt_regs is no longer on the stack.  In that case, instead of
    '&regs->sp', the previous stack pointer should be retrieved from the
    beginning of the current stack page.
    
    kernel_stack_pointer() wants to do that, but it forgets to dereference
    the pointer.  So instead of returning a pointer to the previous stack,
    it returns a pointer to the beginning of the current stack.
    
    Note that it's probably outside of kernel_stack_pointer()'s scope to be
    switching stacks at all.  The x86_64 version of this function doesn't do
    it, and it would be better for the caller to do it if necessary.  But
    that's a patch for another day.  This just fixes the original intent.

    x86/irq: Prevent force migration of irqs which are not in the vector domain
    
    commit db91aa793ff984ac048e199ea1c54202543952fe upstream.
    
    When a CPU is about to be offlined we call fixup_irqs() that resets IRQ
    affinities related to the CPU in question. The same thing is also done when
    the system is suspended to S-states like S3 (mem).
    
    For each IRQ we try to complete any on-going move regardless whether the
    IRQ is actually part of x86_vector_domain. For each IRQ descriptor we fetch
    its chip_data, assume it is of type struct apic_chip_data and manipulate it
    by clearing old_domain mask etc. For irq_chips that are not part of the
    x86_vector_domain, like those created by various GPIO drivers, will find
    their chip_data being changed unexpectly.
    
    Below is an example where GPIO chip owned by pinctrl-sunrisepoint.c gets
    corrupted after resume:
    
      # cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio
      gpiochip0: GPIOs 360-511, parent: platform/INT344B:00, INT344B:00:
       gpio-511 (                    |sysfs               ) in  hi
    
      # rtcwake -s10 -mmem
      <10 seconds passes>
    
      # cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio
      gpiochip0: GPIOs 360-511, parent: platform/INT344B:00, INT344B:00:
       gpio-511 (                    |sysfs               ) in  ?
    
    Note '?' in the output. It means the struct gpio_chip ->get function is
    NULL whereas before suspend it was there.
    
    Fix this by first checking that the IRQ belongs to x86_vector_domain before
    we try to use the chip_data as struct apic_chip_data.

    x86/boot: Fix kdump, cleanup aborted E820_PRAM max_pfn manipulation

    In commit:
    
      ec776ef6bbe1 ("x86/mm: Add support for the non-standard protected e820 type")
    
    Christoph references the original patch I wrote implementing pmem support.
    The intent of the 'max_pfn' changes in that commit were to enable persistent
    memory ranges to be covered by the struct page memmap by default.
    
    However, that approach was abandoned when Christoph ported the patches [1], and
    that functionality has since been replaced by devm_memremap_pages().
    
    In the meantime, this max_pfn manipulation is confusing kdump [2] that
    assumes that everything covered by the max_pfn is "System RAM".  This
    results in kdump hanging or crashing.

    KVM: MIPS: Drop other CPU ASIDs on guest MMU changes
    
    commit 91e4f1b6073dd680d86cdb7e42d7cccca9db39d8 upstream.
    
    When a guest TLB entry is replaced by TLBWI or TLBWR, we only invalidate
    TLB entries on the local CPU. This doesn't work correctly on an SMP host
    when the guest is migrated to a different physical CPU, as it could pick
    up stale TLB mappings from the last time the vCPU ran on that physical
    CPU.
    
    Therefore invalidate both user and kernel host ASIDs on other CPUs,
    which will cause new ASIDs to be generated when it next runs on those
    CPUs.
    
    We're careful only to do this if the TLB entry was already valid, and
    only for the kernel ASID where the virtual address it mapped is outside
    of the guest user address range.

    KVM: PPC: Book3s PR: Allow access to unprivileged MMCR2 register
    
    commit fa73c3b25bd8d0d393dc6109a1dba3c2aef0451e upstream.
    
    The MMCR2 register is available twice, one time with number 785
    (privileged access), and one time with number 769 (unprivileged,
    but it can be disabled completely). In former times, the Linux
    kernel was using the unprivileged register 769 only, but since
    commit 8dd75ccb571f3c92c ("powerpc: Use privileged SPR number
    for MMCR2"), it uses the privileged register 785 instead.
    The KVM-PR code then of course also switched to use the SPR 785,
    but this is causing older guest kernels to crash, since these
    kernels still access 769 instead. So to support older kernels
    with KVM-PR again, we have to support register 769 in KVM-PR, too.

    mfd: rtsx_usb: Avoid setting ucr->current_sg.status
    
    commit 8dcc5ff8fcaf778bb57ab4448fedca9e381d088f upstream.
    
    Member "status" of struct usb_sg_request is managed by usb core. A
    spin lock is used to serialize the change of it. The driver could
    check the value of req->status, but should avoid changing it without
    the hold of the spinlock. Otherwise, it could cause race or error
    in usb core.
    
    This patch could be backported to stable kernels with version later
    than v3.14.

    ALSA: usb-line6: use the same declaration as definition in header for MIDI manufacturer ID
    
    commit 8da08ca03b73593d5299893bf29fc08569c3fb5f upstream.
    
    Currently, usb-line6 module exports an array of MIDI manufacturer ID and
    usb-pod module uses it. However, the declaration is not the definition in
    common header. The difference is explicit length of array. Although
    compiler calculates it and everything goes well, it's better to use the
    same representation between definition and declaration.
    
    This commit fills the length of array for usb-line6 module. As a small
    good sub-effect, this commit suppress below warnings from static analysis
    by sparse v0.5.0.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Extend DragonFly dB scale quirk to cover other variants
    
    commit eb1a74b7bea17eea31915c4f76385cefe69d9795 upstream.
    
    The DragonFly quirk added in 42e3121d90f4 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Add a more
    accurate volume quirk for AudioQuest DragonFly") applies a custom dB map
    on the volume control when its range is reported as 0..50 (0 .. 0.2dB).
    
    However, there exists at least one other variant (hw v1.0c, as opposed
    to the tested v1.2) which reports a different non-sensical volume range
    (0..53) and the custom map is therefore not applied for that device.
    
    This results in all of the volume change appearing close to 100% on
    mixer UIs that utilize the dB TLV information.
    
    Add a fallback case where no dB TLV is reported at all if the control
    range is not 0..50 but still 0..N where N <= 1000 (3.9 dB). Also
    restrict the quirk to only apply to the volume control as there is also
    a mute control which would match the check otherwise.

    ALSA: ali5451: Fix out-of-bound position reporting
    
    commit db68577966abc1aeae4ec597b3dcfa0d56e92041 upstream.
    
    The pointer callbacks of ali5451 driver may return the value at the
    boundary occasionally, and it results in the kernel warning like
      snd_ali5451 0000:00:06.0: BUG: , pos = 16384, buffer size = 16384, period size = 1024
    
    It seems that folding the position offset is enough for fixing the
    warning and no ill-effect has been seen by that.

    timekeeping: Fix __ktime_get_fast_ns() regression
    
    commit 58bfea9532552d422bde7afa207e1a0f08dffa7d upstream.
    
    In commit 27727df240c7 ("Avoid taking lock in NMI path with
    CONFIG_DEBUG_TIMEKEEPING"), I changed the logic to open-code
    the timekeeping_get_ns() function, but I forgot to include
    the unit conversion from cycles to nanoseconds, breaking the
    function's output, which impacts users like perf.
    
    This results in bogus perf timestamps like:

    Add the proper use of timekeeping_delta_to_ns() to convert
    the cycle delta to nanoseconds as needed.
    
    Thanks to Brendan and Alexei for finding this quickly after
    the v4.8 release. Unfortunately the problematic commit has
    landed in some -stable trees so they'll need this fix as
    well.
    
    Many apologies for this mistake. I'll be looking to add a
    perf-clock sanity test to the kselftest timers tests soon.

    time: Add cycles to nanoseconds translation
    
    commit 6bd58f09e1d8cc6c50a824c00bf0d617919986a1 upstream.
    
    The timekeeping code does not currently provide a way to translate
    externally provided clocksource cycles to system time. The cycle count
    is always provided by the result clocksource read() method internal to
    the timekeeping code. The added function timekeeping_cycles_to_ns()
    calculated a nanosecond value from a cycle count that can be added to
    tk_read_base.base value yielding the current system time. This allows
    clocksource cycle values external to the timekeeping code to provide a
    cycle count that can be transformed to system time.
