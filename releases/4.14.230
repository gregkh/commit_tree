    can: flexcan: flexcan_chip_freeze(): fix chip freeze for missing bitrate
    
    commit 47c5e474bc1e1061fb037d13b5000b38967eb070 upstream.
    
    For cases when flexcan is built-in, bitrate is still not set at
    registering. So flexcan_chip_freeze() generates:
    
    [    1.860000] *** ZERO DIVIDE ***   FORMAT=4
    [    1.860000] Current process id is 1
    [    1.860000] BAD KERNEL TRAP: 00000000
    [    1.860000] PC: [<402e70c8>] flexcan_chip_freeze+0x1a/0xa8
    
    To allow chip freeze, using an hardcoded timeout when bitrate is still
    not set.

    init/Kconfig: make COMPILE_TEST depend on HAS_IOMEM
    
    commit ea29b20a828511de3348334e529a3d046a180416 upstream.
    
    I read the commit log of the following two:
    
    - bc083a64b6c0 ("init/Kconfig: make COMPILE_TEST depend on !UML")
    - 334ef6ed06fa ("init/Kconfig: make COMPILE_TEST depend on !S390")
    
    Both are talking about HAS_IOMEM dependency missing in many drivers.
    
    So, 'depends on HAS_IOMEM' seems the direct, sensible solution to me.
    
    This does not change the behavior of UML. UML still cannot enable
    COMPILE_TEST because it does not provide HAS_IOMEM.
    
    The current dependency for S390 is too strong. Under the condition of
    CONFIG_PCI=y, S390 provides HAS_IOMEM, hence can enable COMPILE_TEST.
    
    I also removed the meaningless 'default n'.

    init/Kconfig: make COMPILE_TEST depend on !S390
    
    commit 334ef6ed06fa1a54e35296b77b693bcf6d63ee9e upstream.
    
    While allmodconfig and allyesconfig build for s390 there are also
    various bots running compile tests with randconfig, where PCI is
    disabled. This reveals that a lot of drivers should actually depend on
    HAS_IOMEM.
    Adding this to each device driver would be a never ending story,
    therefore just disable COMPILE_TEST for s390.
    
    The reasoning is more or less the same as described in
    commit bc083a64b6c0 ("init/Kconfig: make COMPILE_TEST depend on !UML").

    bpf, x86: Validate computation of branch displacements for x86-64
    
    commit e4d4d456436bfb2fe412ee2cd489f7658449b098 upstream.
    
    The branch displacement logic in the BPF JIT compilers for x86 assumes
    that, for any generated branch instruction, the distance cannot
    increase between optimization passes.
    
    But this assumption can be violated due to how the distances are
    computed. Specifically, whenever a backward branch is processed in
    do_jit(), the distance is computed by subtracting the positions in the
    machine code from different optimization passes. This is because part
    of addrs[] is already updated for the current optimization pass, before
    the branch instruction is visited.
    
    And so the optimizer can expand blocks of machine code in some cases.
    
    This can confuse the optimizer logic, where it assumes that a fixed
    point has been reached for all machine code blocks once the total
    program size stops changing. And then the JIT compiler can output
    abnormal machine code containing incorrect branch displacements.
    
    To mitigate this issue, we assert that a fixed point is reached while
    populating the output image. This rejects any problematic programs.
    The issue affects both x86-32 and x86-64. We mitigate separately to
    ease backporting.

    cifs: Silently ignore unknown oplock break handle
    
    [ Upstream commit 219481a8f90ec3a5eed9638fb35609e4b1aeece7 ]
    
    Make SMB2 not print out an error when an oplock break is received for an
    unknown handle, similar to SMB1.  The debug message which is printed for
    these unknown handles may also be misleading, so fix that too.
    
    The SMB2 lease break path is not affected by this patch.
    
    Without this, a program which writes to a file from one thread, and
    opens, reads, and writes the same file from another thread triggers the
    below errors several times a minute when run against a Samba server
    configured with "smb2 leases = no".

    cifs: revalidate mapping when we open files for SMB1 POSIX
    
    [ Upstream commit cee8f4f6fcabfdf229542926128e9874d19016d5 ]
    
    RHBZ: 1933527
    
    Under SMB1 + POSIX, if an inode is reused on a server after we have read and
    cached a part of a file, when we then open the new file with the
    re-cycled inode there is a chance that we may serve the old data out of cache
    to the application.
    This only happens for SMB1 (deprecated) and when posix are used.
    The simplest solution to avoid this race is to force a revalidate
    on smb1-posix open.

    platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Allow the FnLock LED to change state
    
    [ Upstream commit 3d677f12ea3a2097a16ded570623567403dea959 ]
    
    On many recent ThinkPad laptops, there's a new LED next to the ESC key,
    that indicates the FnLock status.
    When the Fn+ESC combo is pressed, FnLock is toggled, which causes the
    Media Key functionality to change, making it so that the media keys
    either perform their media key function, or function as an F-key by
    default. The Fn key can be used the access the alternate function at any
    time.
    
    With the current linux kernel, the LED doens't change state if you press
    the Fn+ESC key combo. However, the media key functionality *does*
    change. This is annoying, since the LED will stay on if it was on during
    bootup, and it makes it hard to keep track what the current state of the
    FnLock is.
    
    This patch calls an ACPI function, that gets the current media key
    state, when the Fn+ESC key combo is pressed. Through testing it was
    discovered that this function causes the LED to update correctly to
    reflect the current state when this function is called.
    
    The relevant ACPI calls are the following:
    \_SB_.PCI0.LPC0.EC0_.HKEY.GMKS: Get media key state, returns 0x603 if the FnLock mode is enabled, and 0x602 if it's disabled.
    \_SB_.PCI0.LPC0.EC0_.HKEY.SMKS: Set media key state, sending a 1 will enable FnLock mode, and a 0 will disable it.

    net: pxa168_eth: Fix a potential data race in pxa168_eth_remove
    
    [ Upstream commit 0571a753cb07982cc82f4a5115e0b321da89e1f3 ]
    
    pxa168_eth_remove() firstly calls unregister_netdev(),
    then cancels a timeout work. unregister_netdev() shuts down a device
    interface and removes it from the kernel tables. If the timeout occurs
    in parallel, the timeout work (pxa168_eth_tx_timeout_task) performs stop
    and open of the device. It may lead to an inconsistent state and memory
    leaks.

    ARM: dts: am33xx: add aliases for mmc interfaces
    
    [ Upstream commit 9bbce32a20d6a72c767a7f85fd6127babd1410ac ]
    
    Without DT aliases, the numbering of mmc interfaces is unpredictable.
    Adding them makes it possible to refer to devices consistently.  The
    popular suggestion to use UUIDs obviously doesn't work with a blank
    device fresh from the factory.
    
    See commit fa2d0aa96941 ("mmc: core: Allow setting slot index via
    device tree alias") for more discussion.
