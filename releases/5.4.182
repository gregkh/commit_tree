    fget: clarify and improve __fget_files() implementation
    
    commit e386dfc56f837da66d00a078e5314bc8382fab83 upstream.
    
    Commit 054aa8d439b9 ("fget: check that the fd still exists after getting
    a ref to it") fixed a race with getting a reference to a file just as it
    was being closed.  It was a fairly minimal patch, and I didn't think
    re-checking the file pointer lookup would be a measurable overhead,
    since it was all right there and cached.
    
    But I was wrong, as pointed out by the kernel test robot.
    
    The 'poll2' case of the will-it-scale.per_thread_ops benchmark regressed
    quite noticeably.  Admittedly it seems to be a very artificial test:
    doing "poll()" system calls on regular files in a very tight loop in
    multiple threads.
    
    That means that basically all the time is spent just looking up file
    descriptors without ever doing anything useful with them (not that doing
    'poll()' on a regular file is useful to begin with).  And as a result it
    shows the extra "re-check fd" cost as a sore thumb.
    
    Happily, the regression is fixable by just writing the code to loook up
    the fd to be better and clearer.  There's still a cost to verify the
    file pointer, but now it's basically in the noise even for that
    benchmark that does nothing else - and the code is more understandable
    and has better comments too.
    
    [ Side note: this patch is also a classic case of one that looks very
      messy with the default greedy Myers diff - it's much more legible with
      either the patience of histogram diff algorithm ]

    This reverts commit c9ec3d85c0eef7c71cdc68db758e0f0e378132c0.
    
    This commit causes a regression if 4cdd2450bf739bada353e82d27b00db9af8c3001
    is not applied as well. This was fixed for 5.16, 5.15 and 5.10.
    
    On older stable branches backporting this commit is complicated as relevant
    code changed quite a bit. Furthermore most of the affected hardware barely
    works on those and users would want to use the newer kernels anyway.

    gpio: tegra186: Fix chip_data type confusion
    
    commit d1e972ace42390de739cde87d96043dcbe502286 upstream.
    
    The tegra186 GPIO driver makes the assumption that the pointer
    returned by irq_data_get_irq_chip_data() is a pointer to a
    tegra_gpio structure. Unfortunately, it is actually a pointer
    to the inner gpio_chip structure, as mandated by the gpiolib
    infrastructure. Nice try.
    
    The saving grace is that the gpio_chip is the first member of
    tegra_gpio, so the bug has gone undetected since... forever.
    
    Fix it by performing a container_of() on the pointer. This results
    in no additional code, and makes it possible to understand how
    the whole thing works.

    tty: n_gsm: fix NULL pointer access due to DLCI release
    
    commit 96b169f05cdcc844b400695184d77e42071d14f2 upstream.
    
    The here fixed commit made the tty hangup asynchronous to avoid a circular
    locking warning. I could not reproduce this warning. Furthermore, due to
    the asynchronous hangup the function call now gets queued up while the
    underlying tty is being freed. Depending on the timing this results in a
    NULL pointer access in the global work queue scheduler. To be precise in
    process_one_work(). Therefore, the previous commit made the issue worse
    which it tried to fix.
    
    This patch fixes this by falling back to the old behavior which uses a
    blocking tty hangup call before freeing up the associated tty.

    tty: n_gsm: fix proper link termination after failed open
    
    commit e3b7468f082d106459e86e8dc6fb9bdd65553433 upstream.
    
    Trying to open a DLCI by sending a SABM frame may fail with a timeout.
    The link is closed on the initiator side without informing the responder
    about this event. The responder assumes the link is open after sending a
    UA frame to answer the SABM frame. The link gets stuck in a half open
    state.
    
    This patch fixes this by initiating the proper link termination procedure
    after link setup timeout instead of silently closing it down.

    tty: n_gsm: fix encoding of control signal octet bit DV
    
    commit 737b0ef3be6b319d6c1fd64193d1603311969326 upstream.
    
    n_gsm is based on the 3GPP 07.010 and its newer version is the 3GPP 27.010.
    See https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=1516
    The changes from 07.010 to 27.010 are non-functional. Therefore, I refer to
    the newer 27.010 here. Chapter 5.4.6.3.7 describes the encoding of the
    control signal octet used by the MSC (modem status command). The same
    encoding is also used in convergence layer type 2 as described in chapter
    5.5.2. Table 7 and 24 both require the DV (data valid) bit to be set 1 for
    outgoing control signal octets sent by the DTE (data terminal equipment),
    i.e. for the initiator side.
    Currently, the DV bit is only set if CD (carrier detect) is on, regardless
    of the side.
    
    This patch fixes this behavior by setting the DV bit on the initiator side
    unconditionally.

    xhci: Prevent futile URB re-submissions due to incorrect return value.
    
    commit 243a1dd7ba48c120986dd9e66fee74bcb7751034 upstream.
    
    The -ENODEV return value from xhci_check_args() is incorrectly changed
    to -EINVAL in a couple places before propagated further.
    
    xhci_check_args() returns 4 types of value, -ENODEV, -EINVAL, 1 and 0.
    xhci_urb_enqueue and xhci_check_streams_endpoint return -EINVAL if
    the return value of xhci_check_args <= 0.
    This causes problems for example r8152_submit_rx, calling usb_submit_urb
    in drivers/net/usb/r8152.c.
    r8152_submit_rx will never get -ENODEV after submiting an urb when xHC
    is halted because xhci_urb_enqueue returns -EINVAL in the very beginning.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Let the interrupt handler disable bottom halves.
    
    commit 84918a89d6efaff075de570b55642b6f4ceeac6d upstream.
    
    The interrupt service routine registered for the gadget is a primary
    handler which mask the interrupt source and a threaded handler which
    handles the source of the interrupt. Since the threaded handler is
    voluntary threaded, the IRQ-core does not disable bottom halves before
    invoke the handler like it does for the forced-threaded handler.
    
    Due to changes in networking it became visible that a network gadget's
    completions handler may schedule a softirq which remains unprocessed.
    The gadget's completion handler is usually invoked either in hard-IRQ or
    soft-IRQ context. In this context it is enough to just raise the softirq
    because the softirq itself will be handled once that context is left.
    In the case of the voluntary threaded handler, there is nothing that
    will process pending softirqs. Which means it remain queued until
    another random interrupt (on this CPU) fires and handles it on its exit
    path or another thread locks and unlocks a lock with the bh suffix.
    Worst case is that the CPU goes idle and the NOHZ complains about
    unhandled softirqs.
    
    Disable bottom halves before acquiring the lock (and disabling
    interrupts) and enable them after dropping the lock. This ensures that
    any pending softirqs will handled right away.

    tracefs: Set the group ownership in apply_options() not parse_options()
    
    commit 851e99ebeec3f4a672bb5010cf1ece095acee447 upstream.
    
    Al Viro brought it to my attention that the dentries may not be filled
    when the parse_options() is called, causing the call to set_gid() to
    possibly crash. It should only be called if parse_options() succeeds
    totally anyway.
    
    He suggested the logical place to do the update is in apply_options().

    commit aaaba1c86d04dac8e49bf508b492f81506257da3 upstream.

    The HPT371 chip physically has only one channel, the secondary one,
    however the primary channel registers do exist! Thus we have to
    manually disable the non-existing channel if the BIOS hasn't done this
    already. Similarly to the pata_hpt3x2n driver, always disable the
    primary channel.

    iio: Fix error handling for PM
    
    commit 632fe0bb8c5b9c06ec961f575ee42a6fff5eceeb upstream.
    
    The pm_runtime_enable will increase power disable depth.
    If the probe fails, we should use pm_runtime_disable() to balance
    pm_runtime_enable(). In the PM Runtime docs:
        Drivers in ->remove() callback should undo the runtime PM changes done
        in ->probe(). Usually this means calling pm_runtime_disable(),
        pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() etc.
    We should do this in error handling.
    
    Fix this problem for the following drivers: bmc150, bmg160, kmx61,
    kxcj-1013, mma9551, mma9553.

    configfs: fix a race in configfs_{,un}register_subsystem()
    
    [ Upstream commit 84ec758fb2daa236026506868c8796b0500c047d ]
    
    When configfs_register_subsystem() or configfs_unregister_subsystem()
    is executing link_group() or unlink_group(),
    it is possible that two processes add or delete list concurrently.
    Some unfortunate interleavings of them can cause kernel panic.
    
    One of cases is:
    A --> B --> C --> D
    A <-- B <-- C <-- D
    
         delete list_head *B        |      delete list_head *C

        unlink_obj                  |       unlink_obj
          list_del_init             |         list_del_init

              __list_del            |             __list_del
                // next == C        |
                next->prev = prev   |
                                    |               next->prev = prev
                prev->next = next   |
                                    |                 // prev == B
                                    |                 prev->next = next
    
    Fix this by adding mutex when calling link_group() or unlink_group(),
    but parent configfs_subsystem is NULL when config_item is root.
    So I create a mutex configfs_subsystem_mutex.

    spi: spi-zynq-qspi: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in zynq_qspi_exec_mem_op()
    
    [ Upstream commit ab3824427b848da10e9fe2727f035bbeecae6ff4 ]
    
    In zynq_qspi_exec_mem_op(), kzalloc() is directly used in memset(),
    which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference on failure of
    kzalloc().
    
    Fix this bug by adding a check of tmpbuf.
    
    This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
    differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
    (e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
    inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
    the callers, so they constitute bugs.
    
    Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
    positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
    the bug.
    
    Builds with CONFIG_SPI_ZYNQ_QSPI=m show no new warnings,
    and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.

    netfilter: nf_tables: fix memory leak during stateful obj update
    
    commit dad3bdeef45f81a6e90204bcc85360bb76eccec7 upstream.
    
    stateful objects can be updated from the control plane.
    The transaction logic allocates a temporary object for this purpose.
    
    The ->init function was called for this object, so plain kfree() leaks
    resources. We must call ->destroy function of the object.
    
    nft_obj_destroy does this, but it also decrements the module refcount,
    but the update path doesn't increment it.
    
    To avoid special-casing the update object release, do module_get for
    the update case too and release it via nft_obj_destroy().

    nfp: flower: Fix a potential leak in nfp_tunnel_add_shared_mac()
    
    commit 3a14d0888eb4b0045884126acc69abfb7b87814d upstream.
    
    ida_simple_get() returns an id between min (0) and max (NFP_MAX_MAC_INDEX)
    inclusive.
    So NFP_MAX_MAC_INDEX (0xff) is a valid id.
    
    In order for the error handling path to work correctly, the 'invalid'
    value for 'ida_idx' should not be in the 0..NFP_MAX_MAC_INDEX range,
    inclusive.
    
    So set it to -1.

    net: Force inlining of checksum functions in net/checksum.h
    
    commit 5486f5bf790b5c664913076c3194b8f916a5c7ad upstream.
    
    All functions defined as static inline in net/checksum.h are
    meant to be inlined for performance reason.
    
    But since commit ac7c3e4ff401 ("compiler: enable
    CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING forcibly") the compiler is allowed to
    uninline functions when it wants.
    
    Fair enough in the general case, but for tiny performance critical
    checksum helpers that's counter-productive.
    
    The problem mainly arises when selecting CONFIG_CC_OPTIMISE_FOR_SIZE,
    Those helpers being 'static inline' in header files you suddenly find
    them duplicated many times in the resulting vmlinux.
    
    Here is a typical exemple when building powerpc pmac32_defconfig
    with CONFIG_CC_OPTIMISE_FOR_SIZE. csum_sub() appears 4 times:

    on failure. While lp->indirect_lock is allocated by devm_kmalloc()
    without proper check. It is better to check the value of it to

    drm/edid: Always set RGB444
    
    commit ecbd4912a693b862e25cba0a6990a8c95b00721e upstream.
    
    In order to fill the drm_display_info structure each time an EDID is
    read, the code currently will call drm_add_display_info with the parsed
    EDID.
    
    drm_add_display_info will then call drm_reset_display_info to reset all
    the fields to 0, and then set them to the proper value depending on the
    EDID.
    
    In the color_formats case, we will thus report that we don't support any
    color format, and then fill it back with RGB444 plus the additional
    formats described in the EDID Feature Support byte.
    
    However, since that byte only contains format-related bits since the 1.4
    specification, this doesn't happen if the EDID is following an earlier
    specification. In turn, it means that for one of these EDID, we end up
    with color_formats set to 0.
    
    The EDID 1.3 specification never really specifies what it means by RGB
    exactly, but since both HDMI and DVI will use RGB444, it's fairly safe
    to assume it's supposed to be RGB444.
    
    Let's move the addition of RGB444 to color_formats earlier in
    drm_add_display_info() so that it's always set for a digital display.

    openvswitch: Fix setting ipv6 fields causing hw csum failure
    
    commit d9b5ae5c1b241b91480aa30408be12fe91af834a upstream.
    
    Ipv6 ttl, label and tos fields are modified without first
    pulling/pushing the ipv6 header, which would have updated
    the hw csum (if available). This might cause csum validation
    when sending the packet to the stack, as can be seen in
    the trace below.
    
    Fix this by updating skb->csum if available.

    gso: do not skip outer ip header in case of ipip and net_failover
    
    commit cc20cced0598d9a5ff91ae4ab147b3b5e99ee819 upstream.
    
    We encounter a tcp drop issue in our cloud environment. Packet GROed in
    host forwards to a VM virtio_net nic with net_failover enabled. VM acts
    as a IPVS LB with ipip encapsulation. The full path like:
    host gro -> vm virtio_net rx -> net_failover rx -> ipvs fullnat
     -> ipip encap -> net_failover tx -> virtio_net tx
    
    When net_failover transmits a ipip pkt (gso_type = 0x0103, which means
    SKB_GSO_TCPV4, SKB_GSO_DODGY and SKB_GSO_IPXIP4), there is no gso
    did because it supports TSO and GSO_IPXIP4. But network_header points to
    inner ip header.
    
    Call Trace:
     tcp4_gso_segment        ------> return NULL
     inet_gso_segment        ------> inner iph, network_header points to
     ipip_gso_segment
     inet_gso_segment        ------> outer iph
     skb_mac_gso_segment
    
    Afterwards virtio_net transmits the pkt, only inner ip header is modified.
    And the outer one just keeps unchanged. The pkt will be dropped in remote
    host.

    The root cause of this issue is specific with the rare combination of
    SKB_GSO_DODGY and a tunnel device that adds an SKB_GSO_ tunnel option.
    SKB_GSO_DODGY is set from external virtio_net. We need to reset network
    header when callbacks.gso_segment() returns NULL.
    
    This patch also includes ipv6_gso_segment(), considering SIT, etc.

    tipc: Fix end of loop tests for list_for_each_entry()
    
    commit a1f8fec4dac8bc7b172b2bdbd881e015261a6322 upstream.
    
    These tests are supposed to check if the loop exited via a break or not.
    However the tests are wrong because if we did not exit via a break then
    "p" is not a valid pointer.  In that case, it's the equivalent of
    "if (*(u32 *)sr == *last_key) {".  That's going to work most of the time,
    but there is a potential for those to be equal.

    bpf: Do not try bpf_msg_push_data with len 0
    
    commit 4a11678f683814df82fca9018d964771e02d7e6d upstream.
    
    If bpf_msg_push_data() is called with len 0 (as it happens during
    selftests/bpf/test_sockmap), we do not need to do anything and can
    return early.
    
    Calling bpf_msg_push_data() with len 0 previously lead to a wrong ENOMEM
    error: we later called get_order(copy + len); if len was 0, copy + len
    was also often 0 and get_order() returned some undefined value (at the
    moment 52). alloc_pages() caught that and failed, but then bpf_msg_push_data()
    returned ENOMEM. This was wrong because we are most probably not out of
    memory and actually do not need any additional memory.

    perf data: Fix double free in perf_session__delete()
    
    commit 69560e366fc4d5fca7bebb0e44edbfafc8bcaf05 upstream.
    
    When perf_data__create_dir() fails, it calls close_dir(), but
    perf_session__delete() also calls close_dir() and since dir.version and
    dir.nr were initialized by perf_data__create_dir(), a double free occurs.
    
    This patch moves the initialization of dir.version and dir.nr after
    successful initialization of dir.files, that prevents double freeing.
    This behavior is already implemented in perf_data__open_dir().

    optee: use driver internal tee_context for some rpc
    
    commit aceeafefff736057e8f93f19bbfbef26abd94604 upstream.
    
    Adds a driver private tee_context by moving the tee_context in struct
    optee_notif to struct optee. This tee_context was previously used when
    doing internal calls to secure world to deliver notification.
    
    The new driver internal tee_context is now also when allocating driver
    private shared memory. This decouples the shared memory object from its
    original tee_context. This is needed when the life time of such a memory
    allocation outlives the client tee_context.
    
    This patch fixes the problem described below:
    
    The addition of a shutdown hook by commit f25889f93184 ("optee: fix tee out
    of memory failure seen during kexec reboot") introduced a kernel shutdown
    regression that can be triggered after running the OP-TEE xtest suites.
    
    Once the shutdown hook is called it is not possible to communicate any more
    with the supplicant process because the system is not scheduling task any
    longer. Thus if the optee driver shutdown path receives a supplicant RPC
    request from the OP-TEE we will deadlock the kernel's shutdown.
    
    Fixes: f25889f93184 ("optee: fix tee out of memory failure seen during kexec reboot")
    Fixes: 217e0250cccb ("tee: use reference counting for tee_context")

    x86/fpu: Correct pkru/xstate inconsistency
    
    When eagerly switching PKRU in switch_fpu_finish() it checks that
    current is not a kernel thread as kernel threads will never use PKRU.
    It's possible that this_cpu_read_stable() on current_task
    (ie. get_current()) is returning an old cached value. To resolve this
    reference next_p directly rather than relying on current.
    
    As written it's possible when switching from a kernel thread to a
    userspace thread to observe a cached PF_KTHREAD flag and never restore
    the PKRU. And as a result this issue only occurs when switching
    from a kernel thread to a userspace thread, switching from a non kernel
    thread works perfectly fine because all that is considered in that
    situation are the flags from some other non kernel task and the next fpu
    is passed in to switch_fpu_finish().
    
    This behavior only exists between 5.2 and 5.13 when it was fixed by a
    rewrite decoupling PKRU from xstate, in:
      commit 954436989cc5 ("x86/fpu: Remove PKRU handling from switch_fpu_finish()")
    
    Unfortunately backporting the fix from 5.13 is probably not realistic as
    it's part of a 60+ patch series which rewrites most of the PKRU handling.

    parisc/unaligned: Fix fldd and fstd unaligned handlers on 32-bit kernel
    
    commit dd2288f4a020d693360e3e8d72f8b9d9c25f5ef6 upstream.
    
    Usually the kernel provides fixup routines to emulate the fldd and fstd
    floating-point instructions if they load or store 8-byte from/to a not
    natuarally aligned memory location.
    
    On a 32-bit kernel I noticed that those unaligned handlers didn't worked and
    instead the application got a SEGV.
    While checking the code I found two problems:
    
    First, the OPCODE_FLDD_L and OPCODE_FSTD_L cases were ifdef'ed out by the
    CONFIG_PA20 option, and as such those weren't built on a pure 32-bit kernel.
    This is now fixed by moving the CONFIG_PA20 #ifdef to prevent the compilation
    of OPCODE_LDD_L and OPCODE_FSTD_L only, and handling the fldd and fstd
    instructions.
    
    The second problem are two bugs in the 32-bit inline assembly code, where the
    wrong registers where used. The calculation of the natural alignment used %2
    (vall) instead of %3 (ior), and the first word was stored back to address %1
    (valh) instead of %3 (ior).

    vhost/vsock: don't check owner in vhost_vsock_stop() while releasing
    
    commit a58da53ffd70294ebea8ecd0eb45fd0d74add9f9 upstream.
    
    vhost_vsock_stop() calls vhost_dev_check_owner() to check the device
    ownership. It expects current->mm to be valid.
    
    vhost_vsock_stop() is also called by vhost_vsock_dev_release() when
    the user has not done close(), so when we are in do_exit(). In this
    case current->mm is invalid and we're releasing the device, so we
    should clean it anyway.
    
    Let's check the owner only when vhost_vsock_stop() is called
    by an ioctl.
    
    When invoked from release we can not fail so we don't check return
    code of vhost_vsock_stop(). We need to stop vsock even if it's not
    the owner.

    It leads to mmc0 hang for a long time after any sound activity
    also it  prevented PM_SLEEP to work properly.

    cgroup/cpuset: Fix a race between cpuset_attach() and cpu hotplug
    
    commit 05c7b7a92cc87ff8d7fde189d0fade250697573c upstream.
    
    As previously discussed(https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/1/20/51),
    cpuset_attach() is affected with similar cpu hotplug race,
    as follow scenario:
    
         cpuset_attach()                            cpu hotplug
        ---------------------------            ----------------------
        down_write(cpuset_rwsem)
        guarantee_online_cpus() // (load cpus_attach)
                                            sched_cpu_deactivate
                                              set_cpu_active()
                                              // will change cpu_active_mask
        set_cpus_allowed_ptr(cpus_attach)
          __set_cpus_allowed_ptr_locked()
           // (if the intersection of cpus_attach and
             cpu_active_mask is empty, will return -EINVAL)
        up_write(cpuset_rwsem)
    
    To avoid races such as described above, protect cpuset_attach() call
    with cpu_hotplug_lock.
