    ACPI / battery: Retry to get battery information if failed during probing
    
    commit 75646e758a0ecbed5024454507d5be5b9ea9dcbf upstream.
    
    Some machines (eg. Lenovo Z480) ECs are not stable during boot up
    and causes battery driver fails to be loaded due to failure of getting
    battery information from EC sometimes. After several retries, the
    operation will work. This patch is to retry to get battery information 5
    times if the first try fails.

    x86, ioremap: Speed up check for RAM pages
    
    commit c81c8a1eeede61e92a15103748c23d100880cc8a upstream.
    
    In __ioremap_caller() (the guts of ioremap), we loop over the range of
    pfns being remapped and checks each one individually with page_is_ram().
    For large ioremaps, this can be very slow.  For example, we have a
    device with a 256 GiB PCI BAR, and ioremapping this BAR can take 20+
    seconds -- sometimes long enough to trigger the soft lockup detector!
    
    Internally, page_is_ram() calls walk_system_ram_range() on a single
    page.  Instead, we can make a single call to walk_system_ram_range()
    from __ioremap_caller(), and do our further checks only for any RAM
    pages that we find.  For the common case of MMIO, this saves an enormous
    amount of work, since the range being ioremapped doesn't intersect
    system RAM at all.
    
    With this change, ioremap on our 256 GiB BAR takes less than 1 second.

    rtmutex: Plug slow unlock race
    
    commit 27e35715df54cbc4f2d044f681802ae30479e7fb upstream.
    
    When the rtmutex fast path is enabled the slow unlock function can
    create the following situation:
    
    spin_lock(foo->m->wait_lock);
    foo->m->owner = NULL;
                                    rt_mutex_lock(foo->m); <-- fast path
                                    free = atomic_dec_and_test(foo->refcnt);
                                    rt_mutex_unlock(foo->m); <-- fast path
                                    if (free)
                                       kfree(foo);
    
    spin_unlock(foo->m->wait_lock); <--- Use after free.
    
    Plug the race by changing the slow unlock to the following scheme:
    
         while (!rt_mutex_has_waiters(m)) {
                /* Clear the waiters bit in m->owner */
                clear_rt_mutex_waiters(m);
                owner = rt_mutex_owner(m);
                spin_unlock(m->wait_lock);
                if (cmpxchg(m->owner, owner, 0) == owner)
                   return;
                spin_lock(m->wait_lock);
         }
    
    So in case of a new waiter incoming while the owner tries the slow
    path unlock we have two situations:
    
     unlock(wait_lock);
                                            lock(wait_lock);
     cmpxchg(p, owner, 0) == owner
                                            mark_rt_mutex_waiters(lock);
                                            acquire(lock);
    
    Or:
    
     unlock(wait_lock);
                                            lock(wait_lock);
                                            mark_rt_mutex_waiters(lock);
     cmpxchg(p, owner, 0) != owner
                                            enqueue_waiter();
                                            unlock(wait_lock);
     lock(wait_lock);
     wakeup_next waiter();
     unlock(wait_lock);
                                            lock(wait_lock);
                                            acquire(lock);
    
    If the fast path is disabled, then the simple
    
       m->owner = NULL;
       unlock(m->wait_lock);
    
    is sufficient as all access to m->owner is serialized via
    m->wait_lock;
    
    Also document and clarify the wakeup_next_waiter function as suggested
    by Oleg Nesterov.

    rtmutex: Handle deadlock detection smarter
    
    commit 3d5c9340d1949733eb37616abd15db36aef9a57c upstream.
    
    Even in the case when deadlock detection is not requested by the
    caller, we can detect deadlocks. Right now the code stops the lock
    chain walk and keeps the waiter enqueued, even on itself. Silly not to
    yell when such a scenario is detected and to keep the waiter enqueued.
    
    Return -EDEADLK unconditionally and handle it at the call sites.
    
    The futex calls return -EDEADLK. The non futex ones dequeue the
    waiter, throw a warning and put the task into a schedule loop.
    
    Tagged for stable as it makes the code more robust.

    rtmutex: Detect changes in the pi lock chain
    
    commit 82084984383babe728e6e3c9a8e5c46278091315 upstream.
    
    When we walk the lock chain, we drop all locks after each step. So the
    lock chain can change under us before we reacquire the locks. That's
    harmless in principle as we just follow the wrong lock path. But it
    can lead to a false positive in the dead lock detection logic:
    
    T0 holds L0
    T0 blocks on L1 held by T1
    T1 blocks on L2 held by T2
    T2 blocks on L3 held by T3
    T4 blocks on L4 held by T4
    
    Now we walk the chain
    
    lock T1 -> lock L2 -> adjust L2 -> unlock T1 ->
         lock T2 ->  adjust T2 ->  drop locks
    
    T2 times out and blocks on L0
    
    Now we continue:
    
    lock T2 -> lock L0 -> deadlock detected, but it's not a deadlock at all.
    
    Brad tried to work around that in the deadlock detection logic itself,
    but the more I looked at it the less I liked it, because it's crystal
    ball magic after the fact.
    
    We actually can detect a chain change very simple:
    
    lock T1 -> lock L2 -> adjust L2 -> unlock T1 -> lock T2 -> adjust T2 ->
    
         next_lock = T2->pi_blocked_on->lock;
    
    drop locks
    
    T2 times out and blocks on L0
    
    Now we continue:
    
    lock T2 ->
    
         if (next_lock != T2->pi_blocked_on->lock)
               return;
    
    So if we detect that T2 is now blocked on a different lock we stop the
    chain walk. That's also correct in the following scenario:
    
    lock T1 -> lock L2 -> adjust L2 -> unlock T1 -> lock T2 -> adjust T2 ->
    
         next_lock = T2->pi_blocked_on->lock;
    
    drop locks
    
    T3 times out and drops L3
    T2 acquires L3 and blocks on L4 now
    
    Now we continue:
    
    lock T2 ->
    
         if (next_lock != T2->pi_blocked_on->lock)
               return;
    
    We don't have to follow up the chain at that point, because T2
    propagated our priority up to T4 already.

    rtmutex: Fix deadlock detector for real
    
    commit 397335f004f41e5fcf7a795e94eb3ab83411a17c upstream.
    
    The current deadlock detection logic does not work reliably due to the
    following early exit path:
    
            /*
             * Drop out, when the task has no waiters. Note,
             * top_waiter can be NULL, when we are in the deboosting
             * mode!
             */
            if (top_waiter && (!task_has_pi_waiters(task) ||
                               top_waiter != task_top_pi_waiter(task)))
                    goto out_unlock_pi;
    
    So this not only exits when the task has no waiters, it also exits
    unconditionally when the current waiter is not the top priority waiter
    of the task.
    
    So in a nested locking scenario, it might abort the lock chain walk
    and therefor miss a potential deadlock.
    
    Simple fix: Continue the chain walk, when deadlock detection is
    enabled.
    
    We also avoid the whole enqueue, if we detect the deadlock right away
    (A-A). It's an optimization, but also prevents that another waiter who
    comes in after the detection and before the task has undone the damage
    observes the situation and detects the deadlock and returns
    -EDEADLOCK, which is wrong as the other task is not in a deadlock
    situation.

    When we set the valid bit on invalid GART entries they are
    loaded into the TLB when an adjacent entry is loaded. This

    For stable inclusion the patch probably needs to be modified a bit.

    powerpc/perf: Never program book3s PMCs with values >= 0x80000000
    
    commit f56029410a13cae3652d1f34788045c40a13ffc7 upstream.
    
    We are seeing a lot of PMU warnings on POWER8:
    
        Can't find PMC that caused IRQ
    
    Looking closer, the active PMC is 0 at this point and we took a PMU
    exception on the transition from negative to 0. Some versions of POWER8
    have an issue where they edge detect and not level detect PMC overflows.
    
    A number of places program the PMC with (0x80000000 - period_left),
    where period_left can be negative. We can either fix all of these or
    just ensure that period_left is always >= 1.
    
    This patch takes the second option.

    The cause is that cpuset_mems_allowed() try to take
    mutex_lock(&callback_mutex) under the rcu_read_lock(which was hold in
    __mpol_dup()). And in cpuset_mems_allowed(), the access to cpuset is
    under rcu_read_lock, so in __mpol_dup, we can reduce the rcu_read_lock
    protection region to protect the access to cpuset only in
    current_cpuset_is_being_rebound(). So that we can avoid this bug.
    
    This patch is a temporary solution that just addresses the bug
    mentioned above, can not fix the long-standing issue about cpuset.mems
    rebinding on fork():
    
    "When the forker's task_struct is duplicated (which includes
     ->mems_allowed) and it races with an update to cpuset_being_rebound
     in update_tasks_nodemask() then the task's mems_allowed doesn't get
     updated. And the child task's mems_allowed can be wrong if the
     cpuset's nodemask changes before the child has been added to the
     cgroup's tasklist."

    USB: ftdi_sio: Add extra PID.
    
    commit 5a7fbe7e9ea0b1b9d7ffdba64db1faa3a259164c upstream.
    
    This patch adds PID 0x0003 to the VID 0x128d (Testo). At least the
    Testo 435-4 uses this, likely other gear as well.

    USB: cp210x: add support for Corsair usb dongle
    
    commit b9326057a3d8447f5d2e74a7b521ccf21add2ec0 upstream.
    
    Corsair USB Dongles are shipped with Corsair AXi series PSUs.
    These are cp210x serial usb devices, so make driver detect these.
    I have a program, that can get information from these PSUs.
    
    Tested with 2 different dongles shipped with Corsair AX860i and
    AX1200i units.
