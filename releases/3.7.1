    Staging: bcm: Add two products and remove an existing product.
    
    commit 4f29ef050848245f7c180b95ccf67dfcd76b1fd8 upstream.
    
    This patch adds two new products and modifies
    the device id table to include them. In addition,
    product of 0xbccd - BCM_USB_PRODUCT_ID_SM250 is
    removed because Beceem, ZTE, Sprint use this id
    for block devices.

    rcu: Fix batch-limit size problem
    
    commit 878d7439d0f45a95869e417576774673d1fa243f upstream.
    
    Commit 29c00b4a1d9e27 (rcu: Add event-tracing for RCU callback
    invocation) added a regression in rcu_do_batch()
    
    Under stress, RCU is supposed to allow to process all items in queue,
    instead of a batch of 10 items (blimit), but an integer overflow makes
    the effective limit being 1.  So, unless there is frequent idle periods
    (during which RCU ignores batch limits), RCU can be forced into a
    state where it cannot keep up with the callback-generation rate,
    eventually resulting in OOM.
    
    This commit therefore converts a few variables in rcu_do_batch() from
    int to long to fix this problem, along with the module parameters
    controlling the batch limits.

    USB: EHCI: bugfix: urb->hcpriv should not be NULL
    
    commit 2656a9abcf1ec8dd5fee6a75d6997a0f2fa0094e upstream.
    
    This patch (as1632b) fixes a bug in ehci-hcd.  The USB core uses
    urb->hcpriv to determine whether or not an URB is active; host
    controller drivers are supposed to set this pointer to a non-NULL
    value when an URB is queued.  However ehci-hcd sets it to NULL for
    isochronous URBs, which defeats the check in usbcore.
    
    In itself this isn't a big deal.  But people have recently found that
    certain sequences of actions will cause the snd-usb-audio driver to
    reuse URBs without waiting for them to complete.  In the absence of
    proper checking by usbcore, the URBs get added to their endpoint list
    twice.  This leads to list corruption and a system freeze.
    
    The patch makes ehci-hcd assign a meaningful value to urb->hcpriv for
    isochronous URBs.  Improving robustness always helps.

    perf test: fix a build error on builtin-test
    
    commit 12f8f74b2a4d26c4facfa7ef99487cf0930f6ef7 upstream.
    
    Recently I build perf and get a build error on builtin-test.c. The error is as
    following:

    This problem is introduced in 3e7c439a. CPU_ALLOC and related macros are
    missing in sched__get_first_possible_cpu function. In 54489c18, commiter
    mentioned that CPU_ALLOC has been removed. So CPU_ALLOC calls in this
    function are removed to let perf to be built.

    cdc-acm: implement TIOCSSERIAL to avoid blocking close(2)
    
    commit ba2d8ce9db0a61505362bb17b8899df3d3326146 upstream.
    
    Some devices (ex Nokia C7) simply don't respond at all when data is sent
    to some of their USB interfaces.  The data gets stuck in the TTYs queue
    and sits there until close(2), which them blocks because closing_wait
    defaults to 30 seconds (even though the fd is O_NONBLOCK).  This is
    rarely desired.  Implement the standard mechanism to adjust closing_wait
    and let applications handle it how they want to.

    ring-buffer: Fix race between integrity check and readers
    
    commit 9366c1ba13fbc41bdb57702e75ca4382f209c82f upstream.
    
    The function rb_check_pages() was added to make sure the ring buffer's
    pages were sane. This check is done when the ring buffer size is modified
    as well as when the iterator is released (closing the "trace" file),
    as that was considered a non fast path and a good place to do a sanity
    check.
    
    The problem is that the check does not have any locks around it.
    If one process were to read the trace file, and another were to read
    the raw binary file, the check could happen while the reader is reading
    the file.
    
    The issues with this is that the check requires to clear the HEAD page
    before doing the full check and it restores it afterward. But readers
    require the HEAD page to exist before it can read the buffer, otherwise
    it gives a nasty warning and disables the buffer.
    
    By adding the reader lock around the check, this keeps the race from
    happening.

    ring-buffer: Fix NULL pointer if rb_set_head_page() fails
    
    commit 54f7be5b831254199522523ccab4c3d954bbf576 upstream.
    
    The function rb_set_head_page() searches the list of ring buffer
    pages for a the page that has the HEAD page flag set. If it does
    not find it, it will do a WARN_ON(), disable the ring buffer and
    return NULL, as this should never happen.
    
    But if this bug happens to happen, not all callers of this function
    can handle a NULL pointer being returned from it. That needs to be
    fixed.

    xhci: Extend Fresco Logic MSI quirk.
    
    commit bba18e33f25072ebf70fd8f7f0cdbf8cdb59a746 upstream.
    
    Ali reports that plugging a device into the Fresco Logic xHCI host with
    PCI device ID 1400 produces an IRQ error:
    
     do_IRQ: 3.176 No irq handler for vector (irq -1)
    
    Other early Fresco Logic host revisions don't support MSI, even though
    their PCI config space claims they do.  Extend the quirk to disabling
    MSI to this chipset revision.  Also enable the short transfer quirk,
    since it's likely this revision also has that quirk, and it should be
    harmless to enable.

    USB: OHCI: workaround for hardware bug: retired TDs not added to the Done Queue
    
    commit 50ce5c0683aa83eb161624ea89daa5a9eee0c2ce upstream.
    
    This patch (as1636) is a partial workaround for a hardware bug
    affecting OHCI controllers by NVIDIA at least, maybe others too.  When
    the controller retires a Transfer Descriptor, it is supposed to add
    the TD onto the Done Queue.  But sometimes this doesn't happen, with
    the result that ohci-hcd never realizes the corresponding transfer has
    finished.  Symptoms can vary; a typical result is that USB audio stops
    working after a while.
    
    The patch works around the problem by recognizing that TDs are always
    processed in order.  Therefore, if a later TD is found on the Done
    Queue than all the earlier TDs for the same endpoint must be finished
    as well.
    
    Unfortunately this won't solve the problem in cases where the missing
    TD is the last one in the endpoint's queue.  A complete fix would
    require a signficant amount of change to the driver.

    ACPI / PNP: Do not crash due to stale pointer use during system resume
    
    commit a6b5e88c0e42093b9057856f35770966c8c591e3 upstream.
    
    During resume from system suspend the 'data' field of
    struct pnp_dev in pnpacpi_set_resources() may be a stale pointer,
    due to removal of the associated ACPI device node object in the
    previous suspend-resume cycle.  This happens, for example, if a
    dockable machine is booted in the docking station and then suspended
    and resumed and suspended again.  If that happens,
    pnpacpi_build_resource_template() called from pnpacpi_set_resources()
    attempts to use that pointer and crashes.
    
    However, pnpacpi_set_resources() actually checks the device's ACPI
    handle, attempts to find the ACPI device node object attached to it
    and returns an error code if that fails, so in fact it knows what the
    correct value of dev->data should be.  Use this observation to update
    dev->data with the correct value if necessary and dump a call trace
    if that's the case (once).
    
    We still need to fix the root cause of this issue, but preventing
    systems from crashing because of it is an improvement too.

    ACPI / battery: Correct battery capacity values on Thinkpads
    
    commit 4000e626156935dfb626321ce09cae2c833eabbb upstream.
    
    Add a quirk to correctly report battery capacity on 2010 and 2011
    Lenovo Thinkpad models.
    
    The affected models that I tested (x201, t410, t410s, and x220)
    exhibit a problem where, when battery capacity reporting unit is mAh,
    the values being reported are wrong.  Pre-2010 and 2012 models appear
    to always report in mWh and are thus unaffected.  Also, in mid-2012
    Lenovo issued a BIOS update for the 2011 models that fixes the issue
    (tested on x220 with a post-1.29 BIOS).  No such update is available
    for the 2010 models, so those still need this patch.
    
    Problem description: for some reason, the affected Thinkpads switch
    the reporting unit between mAh and mWh; generally, mAh is used when a
    laptop is plugged in and mWh when it's unplugged, although a
    suspend/resume or rmmod/modprobe is needed for the switch to take
    effect.  The values reported in mAh are *always* wrong.  This does
    not appear to be a kernel regression; I believe that the values were
    never reported correctly.  I tested back to kernel 2.6.34, with
    multiple machines and BIOS versions.
    
    Simply plugging a laptop into mains before turning it on is enough to
    reproduce the problem.  Here's a sample /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info
    from Thinkpad x220 (before a BIOS update) with a 4-cell battery:
    
    present:                 yes
    design capacity:         2886 mAh
    last full capacity:      2909 mAh
    battery technology:      rechargeable
    design voltage:          14800 mV
    design capacity warning: 145 mAh
    design capacity low:     13 mAh
    cycle count:              0
    capacity granularity 1:  1 mAh
    capacity granularity 2:  1 mAh
    model number:            42T4899
    serial number:           21064
    battery type:            LION
    OEM info:                SANYO
    
    Once the laptop switches the unit to mWh (unplug from mains, suspend,
    resume), the output changes to:
    
    present:                 yes
    design capacity:         28860 mWh
    last full capacity:      29090 mWh
    battery technology:      rechargeable
    design voltage:          14800 mV
    design capacity warning: 1454 mWh
    design capacity low:     200 mWh
    cycle count:              0
    capacity granularity 1:  1 mWh
    capacity granularity 2:  1 mWh
    model number:            42T4899
    serial number:           21064
    battery type:            LION
    OEM info:                SANYO
    
    Can you see how the values for "design capacity", etc., differ by a
    factor of 10 instead of 14.8 (the design voltage of this battery)?
    On the battery itself it says: 14.8V, 1.95Ah, 29Wh, so clearly the
    values reported in mWh are correct and the ones in mAh are not.
    
    My guess is that this problem has been around ever since those
    machines were released, but because the most common Thinkpad
    batteries are rated at 10.8V, the error (8%) is small enough that it
    simply hasn't been noticed or at least nobody could be bothered to
    look into it.
    
    My patch works around the problem by adjusting the incorrectly
    reported mAh values by "10000 / design_voltage".  The patch also has
    code to figure out if it should be activated or not.  It only
    activates on Lenovo Thinkpads, only when the unit is mAh, and, as an
    extra precaution, only when the battery capacity reported through
    ACPI does not match what is reported through DMI (I've never
    encountered a machine where the first two conditions would be true
    but the last would not, but better safe than sorry).
    
    I've been using this patch for close to a year on several systems
    without any problems.

    USB: option: blacklist network interface on Huawei E173
    
    commit f36446cf9bbebaa03a80d95cfeeafbaf68218249 upstream.
    
    The Huawei E173 will normally appear as 12d1:1436 in Linux.  But
    the modem has another mode with different device ID and a slightly
    different set of descriptors. This is the mode used by Windows like
    this:
    
      3Modem:      USB\VID_12D1&PID_140C&MI_00\6&3A1D2012&0&0000

      PC UI Inter: USB\VID_12D1&PID_140C&MI_03\6&3A1D2012&0&0003
    
    All interfaces have the same ff/ff/ff class codes in this mode.
    Blacklisting the network interface to allow it to be picked up by
    the network driver.

    commit 6acf5a8c931da9d26c8dd77d784daaf07fa2bff0 upstream.
    
    HPET_TN_FSB is not a proper mask bit; it merely toggles between MSI and
    legacy interrupt delivery. The proper mask bit is HPET_TN_ENABLE, so
    use both bits when (un)masking the interrupt.

    clk: ux500: fix bit error
    
    commit 2630b17b6ee47ac79b4f5120ac49105027f644ea upstream.
    
    This fixes a bit error in the U8500 clock implementation: the
    unused p2_pclk12 registered at bit 12 in periphereral group 6
    was defined as using bit 11 rather than bit 12.
    
    When walking over and disabling the unused clocks in the tree
    at late init time, p2_pclk12 was disabled, by effectively
    clearing the but for p2_pclk11 instead of bit 12 as it should
    have, thus disabling gpio block 6 and 7.

    mm: dmapool: use provided gfp flags for all dma_alloc_coherent() calls
    
    commit 387870f2d6d679746020fa8e25ef786ff338dc98 upstream.
    
    dmapool always calls dma_alloc_coherent() with GFP_ATOMIC flag,
    regardless the flags provided by the caller. This causes excessive
    pruning of emergency memory pools without any good reason. Additionaly,
    on ARM architecture any driver which is using dmapools will sooner or
    later  trigger the following error:
    "ERROR: 256 KiB atomic DMA coherent pool is too small!
    Please increase it with coherent_pool= kernel parameter!".
    Increasing the coherent pool size usually doesn't help much and only
    delays such error, because all GFP_ATOMIC DMA allocations are always
    served from the special, very limited memory pool.
    
    This patch changes the dmapool code to correctly use gfp flags provided
    by the dmapool caller.
