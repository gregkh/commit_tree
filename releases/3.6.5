    pnfsblock: fix non-aligned DIO write
    
    commit 96c9eae638765c2bf2ca4f5a6325484f9bb69aa7 upstream.
    
    For DIO writes, if it is not blocksize aligned, we need to do
    internal serialization. It may slow down writers anyway. So we
    just bail them out and resend to MDS.

    commit f742dc4a32587bff50b13dde9d8894b96851951a upstream.
    
    For DIO read, if it is not sector aligned, we should reject it
    and resend via MDS. Otherwise there might be data corruption.
    Also teach bl_read_pagelist to handle partial page reads for DIO.

    x86, mm: Use memblock memory loop instead of e820_RAM
    
    commit 1f2ff682ac951ed82cc043cf140d2851084512df upstream.
    
    We need to handle E820_RAM and E820_RESERVED_KERNEL at the same time.
    
    Also memblock has page aligned range for ram, so we could avoid mapping
    partial pages.

    x86: efi: Turn off efi_enabled after setup on mixed fw/kernel
    
    commit 5189c2a7c7769ee9d037d76c1a7b8550ccf3481c upstream.
    
    When 32-bit EFI is used with 64-bit kernel (or vice versa), turn off
    efi_enabled once setup is done. Beyond setup, it is normally used to
    determine if runtime services are available and we will have none.
    
    This will resolve issues stemming from efivars modprobe panicking on a
    32/64-bit setup, as well as some reboot issues on similar setups.

    x86, mm: Find_early_table_space based on ranges that are actually being mapped
    
    commit 844ab6f993b1d32eb40512503d35ff6ad0c57030 upstream.
    
    Current logic finds enough space for direct mapping page tables from 0
    to end. Instead, we only need to find enough space to cover mr[0].start
    to mr[nr_range].end -- the range that is actually being mapped by
    init_memory_mapping()
    
    This is needed after 1bbbbe779aabe1f0768c2bf8f8c0a5583679b54a, to address

    These devices provide QMI and ethernet functionality via a standard CDC
    ethernet descriptor.  But when driven by cdc_ether, the QMI
    functionality is unavailable because only cdc_ether can claim the USB
    interface.  Thus blacklist the devices in cdc_ether and add their IDs to
    qmi_wwan, which enables both QMI and ethernet simultaneously.

    commit 065a13e2cc665f6547dc7e8a9d6b6565badf940a upstream.
    
    When sending a pairing request or response we should not just blindly
    copy the value that the remote device sent. Instead we should at least
    make sure to mask out any unknown bits. This is particularly critical
    from the upcoming LE Secure Connections feature perspective as
    incorrectly indicating support for it (by copying the remote value)
    would cause a failure to pair with devices that support it.

    b43: Fix oops on unload when firmware not found
    
    commit f89ff6441df06abc2d95f3ef67525923032d6283 upstream.
    
    When b43 fails to find firmware when loaded, a subsequent unload will
    oops due to calling ieee80211_unregister_hw() when the corresponding
    register call was never made.
    
    Commit 2d838bb608e2d1f6cb4280e76748cb812dc822e7 fixed the same problem
    for b43legacy.

    mac80211: check if key has TKIP type before updating IV
    
    commit 4045f72bcf3c293c7c5932ef001742d8bb5ded76 upstream.
    
    This patch fix corruption which can manifest itself by following crash
    when switching on rfkill switch with rt2x00 driver:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=615362
    
    Pointer key->u.ccmp.tfm of group key get corrupted in:
    
    ieee80211_rx_h_michael_mic_verify():
    
            /* update IV in key information to be able to detect replays */
            rx->key->u.tkip.rx[rx->security_idx].iv32 = rx->tkip_iv32;
            rx->key->u.tkip.rx[rx->security_idx].iv16 = rx->tkip_iv16;
    
    because rt2x00 always set RX_FLAG_MMIC_STRIPPED, even if key is not TKIP.
    
    We already check type of the key in different path in
    ieee80211_rx_h_michael_mic_verify() function, so adding additional
    check here is reasonable.

    mac80211: connect with HT20 if HT40 is not permitted
    
    commit 3a40414f826a8f1096d9b94c4a53ef91b25ba28d upstream.
    
    Some changes to fix issues with HT40 APs in Korea
    and follow-up changes to allow using HT40 even if
    the local regulatory database disallows it caused
    issues with iwlwifi (and could cause issues with
    other devices); iwlwifi firmware would assert if
    you tried to connect to an AP that has an invalid
    configuration (e.g. using HT40- on channel 140.)
    
    Fix this, while avoiding the "Korean AP" issue by
    disabling HT40 and advertising HT20 to the AP
    when connecting.

    The reason for this is that the Debug Unit Chip ID Register has changed between
    Engineering Sample and definitive revision of the SoC. Changing the check of
    cidr to socid will address the problem. We do not integrate this check to the
    list just above because we also have to make sure that the extended id is
    disregarded.

    commit 7840487cd6298f9f931103b558290d8d98d41c49 upstream.
    
    The i2c core driver will turn the platform device ID to busnum
    When using platfrom device ID as -1, it means dynamically assigned
    the busnum. When writing code, we need to make sure the busnum,
    and call i2c_register_board_info(int busnum, ...) to register device
    if using -1, we do not know the value of busnum
    
    In order to solve this issue, set the platform device ID as a fix number
    Here using 0 to match the busnum used in i2c_regsiter_board_info()

    ARM: SAMSUNG: Add naming of s3c64xx-spi devices
    
    commit 308b3afb97dc342e9c4f958d8b4c459ae0e22bd7 upstream.
    
    Commit a5238e360b71 (spi: s3c64xx: move controller information into driver
    data) introduced separate device names for the different subtypes of the
    spi controller but forgot to set these in the relevant machines.
    
    To fix this introduce a s3c64xx_spi_setname function and populate all
    Samsung arches with the correct names. The function resides in a new
    header, as the s3c64xx-spi.h contains driver platform data and should
    therefore at some later point move out of the Samsung include dir.
    
    Tested on a s3c2416-based machine.

    USB: mos7720: fix port-data memory leak
    
    commit 4230af572f95b3115bba1ee6fb95681f3851ab26 upstream.
    
    Fix port-data memory leak by moving port data allocation and
    deallocation to port_probe and port_remove.
    
    Since commit 0998d0631001288 (device-core: Ensure drvdata = NULL when no
    driver is bound) the port private data is no longer freed at release as
    it is no longer accessible.
    
    Note that this patch also fixes a second port-data memory leak in the
    error path of attach, should parallel-port initialisation fail.
    
    Compile-only tested.

    Make sure generic close is called at close.
    
    The driver relies on the generic write implementation but did not call
    generic close.
    
    Note that the call to kill the read urb is not redundant, as mct_u232
    uses an interrupt urb from the second port as the read urb and that
    generic close therefore fails to kill it.

    usb hub: send clear_tt_buffer_complete events when canceling TT clear work
    
    commit 3b6054da68f9b0d5ed6a7ed0f42a79e61904352c upstream.
    
    There is a race condition in the USB hub code with regard to handling
    TT clear requests that can get the HCD driver in a deadlock. Usually
    when an TT clear request is scheduled it will be executed immediately:

    USB: usb-wwan: fix multiple memory leaks in error paths
    
    commit b8f0e82044c9ba40e92340c8a6d47d6bd6d819bc upstream.
    
    Fix port-data memory leak in usb-serial probe error path by moving port
    data allocation to port_probe.
    
    Since commit a1028f0abf ("usb: usb_wwan: replace release and disconnect
    with a port_remove hook") port data is deallocated in port_remove. This
    leaves a possibility for memory leaks if usb-serial probe fails after
    attach but before the port in question has been successfully registered.
    
    Note that this patch also fixes two additional memory leaks in the error
    path of attach should port initialisation fail for any port as the urbs
    were never freed and neither was the data of any of the successfully
    initialised ports.
    
    Compile-only tested.

    extcon: Unregister compat class at module unload to fix oops
    
    commit 0dc77b6dabec8fd298392018cc0de5214af2dc43 upstream.
    
    If you compile extcon with CONFIG_ANDROID and then load and unload the
    module you get a simple oops as the driver does not unregister its
    compat class and thus cannot register it again.

    staging: comedi: amplc_pc236: fix possible NULL deref during detach
    
    commit 2db012bd40b889d8e5483d3daa07af04c4c109d8 upstream.
    
    `pc236_detach()` is called by the comedi core to clean up if either
    `pc236_attach()` or `pc236_attach_pci()` returns an error.  It sets
    `thisboard` to the return value of `comedi_board(dev)` and assumes it is
    non-null.  This is a valid assumption if `pc236_attach()` fails, but not
    if `pc236_attach_pci()` fails, leading to a possible NULL pointer
    dereference.
    
    Check `thisboard` at the top of `pc236_detach()` and return early if it
    is `NULL`.  This is okay because the only other thing that could have
    been allocated is `dev->private` and that is freed by the comedi core,
    not by this function.

    commit aaeb61a97b7159ebe30b18a422d04eeabfa8790b upstream.
    
    `pc236_detach()` is called by the comedi core if it attempted to attach
    a device and failed.  `pc236_detach()` calls `pc236_intr_disable()` if
    the comedi device private data pointer (`devpriv`) is non-null.  This
    test is insufficient as `pc236_intr_disable()` accesses hardware
    registers and the attach routine may have failed before it has saved
    their I/O base addresses.
    
    Fix it by checking `dev->iobase` is non-zero before calling
    `pc236_intr_disable()` as that means the I/O base addresses have been
    saved and the hardware registers can be accessed.  It also implies the
    comedi device private data pointer is valid, so there is no need to
    check it.

    commit 1d1171ffda585c1cab7bd7cf4bd8f8fd5923fb4a upstream.
    
    `pc263_detach()` is called by the comedi core to clean up if either
    `pc263_attach()` or `pc263_attach_pci()` returns an error.  It sets
    `thisboard` to the return value of `comedi_board(dev)` and assumes it is
    non-null.  This is a valid assumption if `pc263_attach()` fails, but not
    if `pc263_attach_pci()` fails, leading to a possible NULL pointer
    dereference.
    
    Check `thisboard` at the top of `pc263_detach()` and return early if it
    is `NULL`.  This is okay because no other resources need cleaning up in
    this case.

    `dio200_detach()` is called by the comedi core to clean up if either

    `thisboard` to the return value of `comedi_board(dev)` and assumes it is
    non-null.  In the case of a previous call to `dio200_attach()` it won't
    be `NULL` because the comedi core will have pointed it to one of the
    elements of `dio200_boards[]`, but in the case of a previous call to
    `dio200_attach_pci()` it could be `NULL`, leading to a null pointer
    dereference.
    
    Check that `thisboard` is valid at the top of `dio200_detach()` and
    return early if it is `NULL`.  This is okay because the only other thing
    that could have been allocated is `dev->private` and that is freed by
    the comedi core, not by this function.

    staging: zram: Fix handling of incompressible pages
    
    commit c8f2f0db1d0294aaf37e8a85bea9bbc4aaf5c0fe upstream.
    
    Change 130f315a (staging: zram: remove special handle of uncompressed page)
    introduced a bug in the handling of incompressible pages which resulted in
    memory allocation failure for such pages.
    
    When a page expands on compression, say from 4K to 4K+30, we were trying to
    do zsmalloc(pool, 4K+30). However, the maximum size which zsmalloc can
    allocate is PAGE_SIZE (for obvious reasons), so such allocation requests
    always return failure (0).
    
    For a page that has compressed size larger than the original size (this may
    happen with already compressed or random data), there is no point storing
    the compressed version as that would take more space and would also require
    time for decompression when needed again. So, the fix is to store any page,
    whose compressed size exceeds a threshold (max_zpage_size), as-it-is i.e.
    without compression.  Memory required for storing this uncompressed page can
    then be requested from zsmalloc which supports PAGE_SIZE sized allocations.
    
    Lastly, the fix checks that we do not attempt to "decompress" the page which
    we stored in the uncompressed form -- we just memcpy() out such pages.

    sysfs: sysfs_pathname/sysfs_add_one: Use strlcat() instead of strcat()
    
    commit 66081a72517a131430dcf986775f3268aafcb546 upstream.
    
    The warning check for duplicate sysfs entries can cause a buffer overflow
    when printing the warning, as strcat() doesn't check buffer sizes.
    Use strlcat() instead.
    
    Since strlcat() doesn't return a pointer to the passed buffer, unlike
    strcat(), I had to convert the nested concatenation in sysfs_add_one() to
    an admittedly more obscure comma operator construct, to avoid emitting code
    for the concatenation if CONFIG_BUG is disabled.

    commit 43a09f7fb01fa1e091416a2aa49b6c666458c1ee upstream.
    
    The command cancellation code doesn't check whether find_trb_seg()
    couldn't find the segment that contains the TRB to be canceled.  This
    could cause a NULL pointer deference later in the function when next_trb

    SUNRPC: Get rid of the xs_error_report socket callback
    
    commit f878b657ce8e7d3673afe48110ec208a29e38c4a upstream.
    
    Chris Perl reports that we're seeing races between the wakeup call in
    xs_error_report and the connect attempts. Basically, Chris has shown
    that in certain circumstances, the call to xs_error_report causes the
    rpc_task that is responsible for reconnecting to wake up early, thus
    triggering a disconnect and retry.
    
    Since the sk->sk_error_report() calls in the socket layer are always
    followed by a tcp_done() in the cases where we care about waking up
    the rpc_tasks, just let the state_change callbacks take responsibility
    for those wake ups.

    mm: fix XFS oops due to dirty pages without buffers on s390
    
    commit ef5d437f71afdf4afdbab99213add99f4b1318fd upstream.
    
    On s390 any write to a page (even from kernel itself) sets architecture
    specific page dirty bit.  Thus when a page is written to via buffered
    write, HW dirty bit gets set and when we later map and unmap the page,
    page_remove_rmap() finds the dirty bit and calls set_page_dirty().
    
    Dirtying of a page which shouldn't be dirty can cause all sorts of
    problems to filesystems.  The bug we observed in practice is that
    buffers from the page get freed, so when the page gets later marked as
    dirty and writeback writes it, XFS crashes due to an assertion
    BUG_ON(!PagePrivate(page)) in page_buffers() called from
    xfs_count_page_state().
    
    Similar problem can also happen when zero_user_segment() call from
    xfs_vm_writepage() (or block_write_full_page() for that matter) set the
    hardware dirty bit during writeback, later buffers get freed, and then
    page unmapped.
    
    Fix the issue by ignoring s390 HW dirty bit for page cache pages of
    mappings with mapping_cap_account_dirty().  This is safe because for
    such mappings when a page gets marked as writeable in PTE it is also
    marked dirty in do_wp_page() or do_page_fault().  When the dirty bit is
    cleared by clear_page_dirty_for_io(), the page gets writeprotected in
    page_mkclean().  So pagecache page is writeable if and only if it is
    dirty.
    
    Thanks to Hugh Dickins for pointing out mapping has to have

    The patch has survived about two hours of running fsx-linux on tmpfs
    while heavily swapping and several days of running on out build machines
    where the original problem was triggered.

    x86, mm: Trim memory in memblock to be page aligned
    
    commit 6ede1fd3cb404c0016de6ac529df46d561bd558b upstream.
    
    We will not map partial pages, so need to make sure memblock
    allocation will not allocate those bytes out.
    
    Also we will use for_each_mem_pfn_range() to loop to map memory
    range to keep them consistent.

    Revert "x86/mm: Fix the size calculation of mapping tables"
    
    commit 7b16bbf97375d9fb7fc107b3f80afeb94a204e44 upstream.
    
    Commit:
    
       722bc6b16771 x86/mm: Fix the size calculation of mapping tables
    
    Tried to address the issue that the first 2/4M should use 4k pages
    if PSE enabled, but extra counts should only be valid for x86_32.
    
    This commit caused a kdump regression: the kdump kernel hangs.
    
    Work is in progress to fundamentally fix the various page table
    initialization issues that we have, via the design suggested
    by H. Peter Anvin, but it's not ready yet to be merged.
    
    So, to get a working kdump revert to the last known working version,
    which is the revert of this commit and of a followup fix (which was
    incomplete):
    
       bd2753b2dda7 x86/mm: Only add extra pages count for the first memory range during pre-allocation
    
    Tested kdump on physical and virtual machines.

    x86-64: Fix page table accounting
    
    commit 876ee61aadf01aa0db981b5d249cbdd53dc28b5e upstream.
    
    Commit 20167d3421a089a1bf1bd680b150dc69c9506810 ("x86-64: Fix
    accounting in kernel_physical_mapping_init()") went a little too
    far by entirely removing the counting of pre-populated page
    tables: this should be done at boot time (to cover the page
    tables set up in early boot code), but shouldn't be done during
    memory hot add.
    
    Hence, re-add the removed increments of "pages", but make them
    and the one in phys_pte_init() conditional upon !after_bootmem.

    ARM: 7559/1: smp: switch away from the idmap before updating init_mm.mm_count
    
    commit 5f40b909728ad784eb43aa309d3c4e9bdf050781 upstream.
    
    When booting a secondary CPU, the primary CPU hands two sets of page
    tables via the secondary_data struct:
    
            (1) swapper_pg_dir: a normal, cacheable, shared (if SMP) mapping
                of the kernel image (i.e. the tables used by init_mm).
    
            (2) idmap_pgd: an uncached mapping of the .idmap.text ELF
                section.
    
    The idmap is generally used when enabling and disabling the MMU, which
    includes early CPU boot. In this case, the secondary CPU switches to
    swapper as soon as it enters C code:
    
            struct mm_struct *mm = &init_mm;
            unsigned int cpu = smp_processor_id();
    
            /*
             * All kernel threads share the same mm context; grab a
             * reference and switch to it.
             */
            atomic_inc(&mm->mm_count);
            current->active_mm = mm;
            cpumask_set_cpu(cpu, mm_cpumask(mm));
            cpu_switch_mm(mm->pgd, mm);
    
    This causes a problem on ARMv7, where the identity mapping is treated as
    strongly-ordered leading to architecturally UNPREDICTABLE behaviour of
    exclusive accesses, such as those used by atomic_inc.
    
    This patch re-orders the secondary_start_kernel function so that we
    switch to swapper before performing any exclusive accesses.

    genalloc: stop crashing the system when destroying a pool
    
    commit eedce141cd2dad8d0cefc5468ef41898949a7031 upstream.
    
    The genalloc code uses the bitmap API from include/linux/bitmap.h and
    lib/bitmap.c, which is based on long values.  Both bitmap_set from
    lib/bitmap.c and bitmap_set_ll, which is the lockless version from
    genalloc.c, use BITMAP_LAST_WORD_MASK to set the first bits in a long in
    the bitmap.
    
    That one uses (1 << bits) - 1, 0b111, if you are setting the first three
    bits.  This means that the API counts from the least significant bits
    (LSB from now on) to the MSB.  The LSB in the first long is bit 0, then.
    The same works for the lookup functions.
    
    The genalloc code uses longs for the bitmap, as it should.  In
    include/linux/genalloc.h, struct gen_pool_chunk has unsigned long
    bits[0] as its last member.  When allocating the struct, genalloc should
    reserve enough space for the bitmap.  This should be a proper number of
    longs that can fit the amount of bits in the bitmap.
    
    However, genalloc allocates an integer number of bytes that fit the
    amount of bits, but may not be an integer amount of longs.  9 bytes, for
    example, could be allocated for 70 bits.
    
    This is a problem in itself if the Least Significat Bit in a long is in
    the byte with the largest address, which happens in Big Endian machines.
    This means genalloc is not allocating the byte in which it will try to
    set or check for a bit.
    
    This may end up in memory corruption, where genalloc will try to set the
    bits it has not allocated.  In fact, genalloc may not set these bits
    because it may find them already set, because they were not zeroed since
    they were not allocated.  And that's what causes a BUG when
    gen_pool_destroy is called and check for any set bits.
    
    What really happens is that genalloc uses kmalloc_node with __GFP_ZERO
    on gen_pool_add_virt.  With SLAB and SLUB, this means the whole slab
    will be cleared, not only the requested bytes.  Since struct
    gen_pool_chunk has a size that is a multiple of 8, and slab sizes are
    multiples of 8, we get lucky and allocate and clear the right amount of
    bytes.
    
    Hower, this is not the case with SLOB or with older code that did memset
    after allocating instead of using __GFP_ZERO.
    
    So, a simple module as this (running 3.6.0), will cause a crash when
    rmmod'ed.

    gen_init_cpio: avoid stack overflow when expanding
    
    commit 20f1de659b77364d55d4e7fad2ef657e7730323f upstream.
    
    Fix possible overflow of the buffer used for expanding environment
    variables when building file list.
    
    In the extremely unlikely case of an attacker having control over the
    environment variables visible to gen_init_cpio, control over the
    contents of the file gen_init_cpio parses, and gen_init_cpio was built
    without compiler hardening, the attacker can gain arbitrary execution
    control via a stack buffer overflow.
    
      $ cat usr/crash.list
      file foo ${BIG}${BIG}${BIG}${BIG}${BIG}${BIG} 0755 0 0
      $ BIG=$(perl -e 'print "A" x 4096;') ./usr/gen_init_cpio usr/crash.list
      *** buffer overflow detected ***: ./usr/gen_init_cpio terminated
    
    This also replaces the space-indenting with tabs.

    VFS: don't do protected {sym,hard}links by default
    
    commit 561ec64ae67ef25cac8d72bb9c4bfc955edfd415 upstream.
    
    In commit 800179c9b8a1 ("This adds symlink and hardlink restrictions to
    the Linux VFS"), the new link protections were enabled by default, in
    the hope that no actual application would care, despite it being
    technically against legacy UNIX (and documented POSIX) behavior.
    
    However, it does turn out to break some applications.  It's rare, and
    it's unfortunate, but it's unacceptable to break existing systems, so
    we'll have to default to legacy behavior.
    
    In particular, it has broken the way AFD distributes files, see
    
      http://www.dwd.de/AFD/
    
    along with some legacy scripts.
    
    Distributions can end up setting this at initrd time or in system
    scripts: if you have security problems due to link attacks during your
    early boot sequence, you have bigger problems than some kernel sysctl
    setting. Do:
    
            echo 1 > /proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks
            echo 1 > /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
    
    to re-enable the link protections.
    
    Alternatively, we may at some point introduce a kernel config option
    that sets these kinds of "more secure but not traditional" behavioural
    options automatically.
