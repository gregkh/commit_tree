    net/nfc: Avoid stalls when nfc_alloc_send_skb() returned NULL.
    
    commit 3bc53be9db21040b5d2de4d455f023c8c494aa68 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting stalls at nfc_llcp_send_ui_frame() [1]. This is
    because nfc_llcp_send_ui_frame() is retrying the loop without any delay
    when nonblocking nfc_alloc_send_skb() returned NULL.
    
    Since there is no need to use MSG_DONTWAIT if we retry until
    sock_alloc_send_pskb() succeeds, let's use blocking call.
    Also, in case an unexpected error occurred, let's break the loop
    if blocking nfc_alloc_send_skb() failed.

    KEYS: DNS: fix parsing multiple options
    
    commit c604cb767049b78b3075497b80ebb8fd530ea2cc upstream.
    
    My recent fix for dns_resolver_preparse() printing very long strings was
    incomplete, as shown by syzbot which still managed to hit the
    WARN_ONCE() in set_precision() by adding a crafted "dns_resolver" key:
    
        precision 50001 too large
        WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 864 at lib/vsprintf.c:2164 vsnprintf+0x48a/0x5a0
    
    The bug this time isn't just a printing bug, but also a logical error
    when multiple options ("#"-separated strings) are given in the key
    payload.  Specifically, when separating an option string into name and
    value, if there is no value then the name is incorrectly considered to
    end at the end of the key payload, rather than the end of the current
    option.  This bypasses validation of the option length, and also means
    that specifying multiple options is broken -- which presumably has gone
    unnoticed as there is currently only one valid option anyway.
    
    A similar problem also applied to option values, as the kstrtoul() when
    parsing the "dnserror" option will read past the end of the current
    option and into the next option.
    
    Fix these bugs by correctly computing the length of the option name and
    by copying the option value, null-terminated, into a temporary buffer.
    
    Reproducer for the WARN_ONCE() that syzbot hit:
    
        perl -e 'print "#A#", "\0" x 50000' | keyctl padd dns_resolver desc @s
    
    Reproducer for "dnserror" option being parsed incorrectly (expected
    behavior is to fail when seeing the unknown option "foo", actual
    behavior was to read the dnserror value as "1#foo" and fail there):
    
        perl -e 'print "#dnserror=1#foo\0"' | keyctl padd dns_resolver desc @s

    netfilter: ebtables: reject non-bridge targets
    
    commit 11ff7288beb2b7da889a014aff0a7b80bf8efcf3 upstream.
    
    the ebtables evaluation loop expects targets to return
    positive values (jumps), or negative values (absolute verdicts).
    
    This is completely different from what xtables does.
    In xtables, targets are expected to return the standard netfilter
    verdicts, i.e. NF_DROP, NF_ACCEPT, etc.
    
    ebtables will consider these as jumps.
    
    Therefore reject any target found due to unspec fallback.
    v2: also reject watchers.  ebtables ignores their return value, so
    a target that assumes skb ownership (and returns NF_STOLEN) causes
    use-after-free.
    
    The only watchers in the 'ebtables' front-end are log and nflog;
    both have AF_BRIDGE specific wrappers on kernel side.

    net/mlx5: Fix command interface race in polling mode
    
    [ Upstream commit d412c31dae053bf30a1bc15582a9990df297a660 ]
    
    The command interface can work in two modes: Events and Polling.
    In the general case, each time we invoke a command, a work is
    queued to handle it.
    
    When working in events, the interrupt handler completes the
    command execution. On the other hand, when working in polling
    mode, the work itself completes it.
    
    Due to a bug in the work handler, a command could have been
    completed by the interrupt handler, while the work handler
    hasn't finished yet, causing the it to complete once again
    if the command interface mode was changed from Events to
    polling after the interrupt handler was called.

            mlx5_stop_eqs()
                    // Destroy the EQ before cmd EQ

                            write_doorbell()
                            --> EVENT_TYPE_CMD
                                    mlx5_cmd_comp_handler() // First free
                                            free_ent(cmd, ent->idx)
                                            complete(&ent->done)
    
            <-- mlx5_stop_eqs //cmd was complete
                    // move to polling before destroying the last cmd EQ
                    mlx5_cmd_use_polling()
                            cmd->mode = POLL;
    
                    --> cmd_work_handler (continues)
                            if (cmd->mode == POLL)
                                    mlx5_cmd_comp_handler() // Double free
    
    The solution is to store the cmd->mode before writing the doorbell.

    tcp: prevent bogus FRTO undos with non-SACK flows
    
    [ Upstream commit 1236f22fbae15df3736ab4a984c64c0c6ee6254c ]
    
    If SACK is not enabled and the first cumulative ACK after the RTO
    retransmission covers more than the retransmitted skb, a spurious
    FRTO undo will trigger (assuming FRTO is enabled for that RTO).
    The reason is that any non-retransmitted segment acknowledged will
    set FLAG_ORIG_SACK_ACKED in tcp_clean_rtx_queue even if there is
    no indication that it would have been delivered for real (the
    scoreboard is not kept with TCPCB_SACKED_ACKED bits in the non-SACK
    case so the check for that bit won't help like it does with SACK).
    Having FLAG_ORIG_SACK_ACKED set results in the spurious FRTO undo
    in tcp_process_loss.
    
    We need to use more strict condition for non-SACK case and check
    that none of the cumulatively ACKed segments were retransmitted
    to prove that progress is due to original transmissions. Only then
    keep FLAG_ORIG_SACK_ACKED set, allowing FRTO undo to proceed in
    non-SACK case.
    
    (FLAG_ORIG_SACK_ACKED is planned to be renamed to FLAG_ORIG_PROGRESS
    to better indicate its purpose but to keep this change minimal, it
    will be done in another patch).
    
    Besides burstiness and congestion control violations, this problem
    can result in RTO loop: When the loss recovery is prematurely
    undoed, only new data will be transmitted (if available) and
    the next retransmission can occur only after a new RTO which in case
    of multiple losses (that are not for consecutive packets) requires
    one RTO per loss to recover.

    tcp: fix Fast Open key endianness

    Fast Open key could be stored in different endian based on the CPU.
    Previously hosts in different endianness in a server farm using
    the same key config (sysctl value) would produce different cookies.
    This patch fixes it by always storing it as little endian to keep

    net: sungem: fix rx checksum support
    
    [ Upstream commit 12b03558cef6d655d0d394f5e98a6fd07c1f6c0f ]
    
    After commit 88078d98d1bb ("net: pskb_trim_rcsum() and CHECKSUM_COMPLETE
    are friends"), sungem owners reported the infamous "eth0: hw csum failure"
    message.
    
    CHECKSUM_COMPLETE has in fact never worked for this driver, but this
    was masked by the fact that upper stacks had to strip the FCS, and
    therefore skb->ip_summed was set back to CHECKSUM_NONE before
    my recent change.
    
    Driver configures a number of bytes to skip when the chip computes
    the checksum, and for some reason only half of the Ethernet header
    was skipped.
    
    Then a second problem is that we should strip the FCS by default,
    unless the driver is updated to eventually support NETIF_F_RXFCS in
    the future.
    
    Finally, a driver should check if NETIF_F_RXCSUM feature is enabled
    or not, so that the admin can turn off rx checksum if wanted.

    crypto: crypto4xx - fix crypto4xx_build_pdr, crypto4xx_build_sdr leak
    
    commit 5d59ad6eea82ef8df92b4109615a0dde9d8093e9 upstream.
    
    If one of the later memory allocations in rypto4xx_build_pdr()
    fails: dev->pdr (and/or) dev->pdr_uinfo wouldn't be freed.
    
    crypto4xx_build_sdr() has the same issue with dev->sdr.

    bcm63xx_enet: do not write to random DMA channel on BCM6345
    
    commit d6213c1f2ad54a964b77471690264ed685718928 upstream.
    
    The DMA controller regs actually point to DMA channel 0, so the write to
    ENETDMA_CFG_REG will actually modify a random DMA channel.
    
    Since DMA controller registers do not exist on BCM6345, guard the write
    with the usual check for dma_has_sram.

    loop: remember whether sysfs_create_group() was done

    syzbot is hitting WARN() triggered by memory allocation fault
    injection [1] because loop module is calling sysfs_remove_group()
    when sysfs_create_group() failed.
    Fix this by remembering whether sysfs_create_group() succeeded.

    RDMA/ucm: Mark UCM interface as BROKEN
    
    commit 7a8690ed6f5346f6738971892205e91d39b6b901 upstream.
    
    In commit 357d23c811a7 ("Remove the obsolete libibcm library")
    in rdma-core [1], we removed obsolete library which used the
    /dev/infiniband/ucmX interface.
    
    Following multiple syzkaller reports about non-sanitized
    user input in the UCMA module, the short audit reveals the same
    issues in UCM module too.
    
    It is better to disable this interface in the kernel,
    before syzkaller team invests time and energy to harden
    this unused interface.

    PM / hibernate: Fix oops at snapshot_write()
    
    commit fc14eebfc20854a38fd9f1d93a42b1783dad4d17 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting NULL pointer dereference at snapshot_write() [1].
    This is because data->handle is zero-cleared by ioctl(SNAPSHOT_FREE).
    Fix this by checking data_of(data->handle) != NULL before using it.

    loop: add recursion validation to LOOP_CHANGE_FD
    
    commit d2ac838e4cd7e5e9891ecc094d626734b0245c99 upstream.
    
    Refactor the validation code used in LOOP_SET_FD so it is also used in
    LOOP_CHANGE_FD.  Otherwise it is possible to construct a set of loop
    devices that all refer to each other.  This can lead to a infinite
    loop in starting with "while (is_loop_device(f)) .." in loop_set_fd().
    
    Fix this by refactoring out the validation code and using it for
    LOOP_CHANGE_FD as well as LOOP_SET_FD.

    syzbot reports following splat:

    Fix up non-directory creation in SGID directories
    
    commit 0fa3ecd87848c9c93c2c828ef4c3a8ca36ce46c7 upstream.
    
    sgid directories have special semantics, making newly created files in
    the directory belong to the group of the directory, and newly created
    subdirectories will also become sgid.  This is historically used for
    group-shared directories.
    
    But group directories writable by non-group members should not imply
    that such non-group members can magically join the group, so make sure
    to clear the sgid bit on non-directories for non-members (but remember
    that sgid without group execute means "mandatory locking", just to
    confuse things even more).

    Corsair Strafe appears to suffer from the same issues

    Apply the same quirks (control message delay and init delay)
    that the RGB version has to 1b1c:1b15.
    
    With these quirks in place the keyboard works correctly upon
    booting the system, and no longer requires reattaching the device.

    commit f1e255d60ae66a9f672ff9a207ee6cd8e33d2679 upstream.
    
    In general, accessing userspace memory beyond the length of the supplied
    buffer in VFS read/write handlers can lead to both kernel memory corruption
    (via kernel_read()/kernel_write(), which can e.g. be triggered via
    sys_splice()) and privilege escalation inside userspace.
    
    Fix it by using simple_read_from_buffer() instead of custom logic.
