    soc/tegra: pmc: Fix imbalanced clock disabling in error code path
    
    commit 19221e3083020bd9537624caa0ee0145ed92ba36 upstream.
    
    The tegra_powergate_power_up() has a typo in the error code path where it
    will try to disable clocks twice, fix it. In practice that error never
    happens, so this is a minor correction.

    usb: max-3421: Use driver data instead of maintaining a list of bound devices
    
    commit fc153aba3ef371d0d76eb88230ed4e0dee5b38f2 upstream.
    
    Instead of maintaining a single-linked list of devices that must be
    searched linearly in .remove() just use spi_set_drvdata() to remember the
    link between the spi device and the driver struct. Then the global list
    and the next member can be dropped.
    
    This simplifies the driver, reduces the memory footprint and the time to
    search the list. Also it makes obvious that there is always a corresponding
    driver struct for a given device in .remove(), so the error path for
    !max3421_hcd can be dropped, too.
    
    As a side effect this fixes a data inconsistency when .probe() races with
    itself for a second max3421 device in manipulating max3421_hcd_list. A
    similar race is fixed in .remove(), too.

    ASoC: DAPM: Cover regression by kctl change notification fix
    
    commit 827b0913a9d9d07a0c3e559dbb20ca4d6d285a54 upstream.
    
    The recent fix for DAPM to correct the kctl change notification by the
    commit 5af82c81b2c4 ("ASoC: DAPM: Fix missing kctl change
    notifications") caused other regressions since it changed the behavior
    of snd_soc_dapm_set_pin() that is called from several API functions.
    Formerly it returned always 0 for success, but now it returns 0 or 1.
    
    This patch addresses it, restoring the old behavior of
    snd_soc_dapm_set_pin() while keeping the fix in
    snd_soc_dapm_put_pin_switch().

    batman-adv: Don't always reallocate the fragmentation skb head
    
    commit 992b03b88e36254e26e9a4977ab948683e21bd9f upstream.
    
    When a packet is fragmented by batman-adv, the original batman-adv header
    is not modified. Only a new fragmentation is inserted between the original
    one and the ethernet header. The code must therefore make sure that it has
    a writable region of this size in the skbuff head.
    
    But it is not useful to always reallocate the skbuff by this size even when
    there would be more than enough headroom still in the skb. The reallocation
    is just to costly during in this codepath.

    batman-adv: Reserve needed_*room for fragments
    
    commit c5cbfc87558168ef4c3c27ce36eba6b83391db19 upstream.
    
    The batadv net_device is trying to propagate the needed_headroom and
    needed_tailroom from the lower devices. This is needed to avoid cost
    intensive reallocations using pskb_expand_head during the transmission.
    
    But the fragmentation code split the skb's without adding extra room at the
    end/beginning of the various fragments. This reduced the performance of
    transmissions over complex scenarios (batadv on vxlan on wireguard) because
    the lower devices had to perform the reallocations at least once.

    If a batman-adv packets has to be fragmented, then the original batman-adv
    packet header is not stripped away. Instead, only a new header is added in
    front of the packet after it was split.
    
    This size must be considered to avoid cost intensive reallocations during

    batman-adv: mcast: fix duplicate mcast packets from BLA backbone to mesh
    
    commit 2369e827046920ef0599e6a36b975ac5c0a359c2 upstream.
    
    Scenario:
    * Multicast frame send from BLA backbone gateways (multiple nodes
      with their bat0 bridged together, with BLA enabled) sharing the same
      LAN to nodes in the mesh
    
    Issue:
    * Nodes receive the frame multiple times on bat0 from the mesh,
      once from each foreign BLA backbone gateway which shares the same LAN
      with another
    
    For multicast frames via batman-adv broadcast packets coming from the
    same BLA backbone but from different backbone gateways duplicates are
    currently detected via a CRC history of previously received packets.
    
    However this CRC so far was not performed for multicast frames received
    via batman-adv unicast packets. Fixing this by appyling the same check
    for such packets, too.
    
    Room for improvements in the future: Ideally we would introduce the
    possibility to not only claim a client, but a complete originator, too.
    This would allow us to only send a multicast-in-unicast packet from a BLA
    backbone gateway claiming the node and by that avoid potential redundant
    transmissions in the first place.

    batman-adv: mcast: fix duplicate mcast packets in BLA backbone from LAN
    
    commit 3236d215ad38a3f5372e65cd1e0a52cf93d3c6a2 upstream.
    
    Scenario:
    * Multicast frame send from a BLA backbone (multiple nodes with
      their bat0 bridged together, with BLA enabled)
    
    Issue:
    * BLA backbone nodes receive the frame multiple times on bat0
    
    For multicast frames received via batman-adv broadcast packets the
    originator of the broadcast packet is checked before decapsulating and
    forwarding the frame to bat0 (batadv_bla_is_backbone_gw()->
    batadv_recv_bcast_packet()). If it came from a node which shares the
    same BLA backbone with us then it is not forwarded to bat0 to avoid a
    loop.
    
    When sending a multicast frame in a non-4-address batman-adv unicast
    packet we are currently missing this check - and cannot do so because
    the batman-adv unicast packet has no originator address field.
    
    However, we can simply fix this on the sender side by only sending the
    multicast frame via unicasts to interested nodes which do not share the
    same BLA backbone with us. This also nicely avoids some unnecessary
    transmissions on mesh side.
    
    Note that no infinite loop was observed, probably because of dropping
    via batadv_interface_tx()->batadv_bla_tx(). However the duplicates still
    utterly confuse switches/bridges, ICMPv6 duplicate address detection and
    neighbor discovery and therefore leads to long delays before being able
    to establish TCP connections, for instance. And it also leads to the Linux
    bridge printing messages like:
    "br-lan: received packet on eth1 with own address as source address ..."

    batman-adv: Fix own OGM check in aggregated OGMs
    
    commit d8bf0c01642275c7dca1e5d02c34e4199c200b1f upstream.
    
    The own OGM check is currently misplaced and can lead to the following
    issues:
    
    For one thing we might receive an aggregated OGM from a neighbor node
    which has our own OGM in the first place. We would then not only skip
    our own OGM but erroneously also any other, following OGM in the
    aggregate.
    
    For another, we might receive an OGM aggregate which has our own OGM in
    a place other then the first one. Then we would wrongly not skip this
    OGM, leading to populating the orginator and gateway table with ourself.

    batman-adv: Keep fragments equally sized
    
    commit 1c2bcc766be44467809f1798cd4ceacafe20a852 upstream.
    
    The batman-adv fragmentation packets have the design problem that they
    cannot be refragmented and cannot handle padding by the underlying link.
    The latter often leads to problems when networks are incorrectly configured
    and don't use a common MTU.
    
    The sender could for example fragment a 1271 byte frame (plus external
    ethernet header (14) and batadv unicast header (10)) to fit in a 1280 bytes
    large MTU of the underlying link (max. 1294 byte frames). This would create
    a 1294 bytes large frame (fragment 2) and a 55 bytes large frame
    (fragment 1). The extra 54 bytes are the fragment header (20) added to each
    fragment and the external ethernet header (14) for the second fragment.
    
    Let us assume that the next hop is then not able to transport 1294 bytes to
    its next hop. The 1294 byte large frame will be dropped but the 55 bytes
    large fragment will still be forwarded to its destination.
    
    Or let us assume that the underlying hardware requires that each frame has
    a minimum size (e.g. 60 bytes). Then it will pad the 55 bytes frame to 60
    bytes. The receiver of the 60 bytes frame will no longer be able to
    correctly assemble the two frames together because it is not aware that 5
    bytes of the 60 bytes frame are padding and don't belong to the reassembled
    frame.
    
    This can partly be avoided by splitting frames more equally. In this
    example, the 675 and 674 bytes large fragment frames could both potentially
    reach its destination without being too large or too small.

    btrfs: fix memory ordering between normal and ordered work functions
    
    commit 45da9c1767ac31857df572f0a909fbe88fd5a7e9 upstream.
    
    Ordered work functions aren't guaranteed to be handled by the same thread
    which executed the normal work functions. The only way execution between
    normal/ordered functions is synchronized is via the WORK_DONE_BIT,
    unfortunately the used bitops don't guarantee any ordering whatsoever.
    
    This manifested as seemingly inexplicable crashes on ARM64, where
    async_chunk::inode is seen as non-null in async_cow_submit which causes
    submit_compressed_extents to be called and crash occurs because
    async_chunk::inode suddenly became NULL. The call trace was similar to:
    
        pc : submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0

    Fix this by adding respective barrier calls which ensure that all
    accesses preceding setting of WORK_DONE_BIT are strictly ordered before
    setting the flag. At the same time add a read barrier after reading of
    WORK_DONE_BIT in run_ordered_work which ensures all subsequent loads
    would be strictly ordered after reading the bit. This in turn ensures
    are all accesses before WORK_DONE_BIT are going to be strictly ordered
    before any access that can occur in ordered_func.

    mm: kmemleak: slob: respect SLAB_NOLEAKTRACE flag
    
    commit 34dbc3aaf5d9e89ba6cc5e24add9458c21ab1950 upstream.
    
    When kmemleak is enabled for SLOB, system does not boot and does not
    print anything to the console.  At the very early stage in the boot
    process we hit infinite recursion from kmemleak_init() and eventually
    kernel crashes.
    
    kmemleak_init() specifies SLAB_NOLEAKTRACE for KMEM_CACHE(), but
    kmem_cache_create_usercopy() removes it because CACHE_CREATE_MASK is not
    valid for SLOB.
    
    Let's fix CACHE_CREATE_MASK and make kmemleak work with SLOB

    As stated in the bonding doc, trans_start must be set manually for drivers
    using NETIF_F_LLTX:
     Drivers that use NETIF_F_LLTX flag must also update
     netdev_queue->trans_start. If they do not, then the ARP monitor will
     immediately fail any slaves using that driver, and those slaves will stay
     down.

    NFC: reorder the logic in nfc_{un,}register_device
    
    [ Upstream commit 3e3b5dfcd16a3e254aab61bd1e8c417dd4503102 ]
    
    There is a potential UAF between the unregistration routine and the NFC
    netlink operations.
    
    The race that cause that UAF can be shown as below:
    
     (FREE)                      |  (USE)
    nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev   |  nfc_genl_dev_up
      nci_close_device           |
      nci_unregister_device      |    nfc_get_device
        nfc_unregister_device    |    nfc_dev_up
          rfkill_destory         |
          device_del             |      rfkill_blocked
      ...                        |    ...
    
    The root cause for this race is concluded below:
    1. The rfkill_blocked (USE) in nfc_dev_up is supposed to be placed after
    the device_is_registered check.
    2. Since the netlink operations are possible just after the device_add
    in nfc_register_device, the nfc_dev_up() can happen anywhere during the
    rfkill creation process, which leads to data race.
    
    This patch reorder these actions to permit
    1. Once device_del is finished, the nfc_dev_up cannot dereference the
    rfkill object.
    2. The rfkill_register need to be placed after the device_add of nfc_dev
    because the parent device need to be created first. So this patch keeps
    the order but inject device_lock to prevent the data race.

    NFC: reorganize the functions in nci_request
    
    [ Upstream commit 86cdf8e38792545161dbe3350a7eced558ba4d15 ]
    
    There is a possible data race as shown below:
    
    thread-A in nci_request()       | thread-B in nci_close_device()
                                    | mutex_lock(&ndev->req_lock);
    test_bit(NCI_UP, &ndev->flags); |
    ...                             | test_and_clear_bit(NCI_UP, &ndev->flags)
    mutex_lock(&ndev->req_lock);    |
                                    |
    
    This race will allow __nci_request() to be awaked while the device is
    getting removed.
    
    Similar to commit e2cb6b891ad2 ("bluetooth: eliminate the potential race
    condition when removing the HCI controller"). this patch alters the

    While issuing VF Reset from the guest OS, the VF driver prints
    logs about critical / Overflow error detection. This is not an
    actual error since the VF_MBX_ARQLEN register is set to all FF's
    for a short period of time and the VF would catch the bits set if
    it was reading the register during that spike of time.
    This patch introduces an additional check to ignore this condition
    since the VF is in reset.

    Nothing protects the access to the per_cpu variable sd_llc_id. When testing
    the same CPU (i.e. this_cpu == that_cpu), a race condition exists with
    update_top_cache_domain(). One scenario being:
    
                  CPU1                            CPU2
      ==================================================================

      cpus_share_cache(CPUX, CPUX)          update_top_cache_domain(CPUX)

                                              per_cpu(sd_llc_id, CPUX) = CPUX

        return false
    
    ttwu_queue_cond() wouldn't catch smp_processor_id() == cpu and the result
    is a warning triggered from ttwu_queue_wakelist().
    
    Avoid a such race in cpus_share_cache() by always returning true when
    this_cpu == that_cpu.

    powerpc/dcr: Use cmplwi instead of 3-argument cmpli
    
    [ Upstream commit fef071be57dc43679a32d5b0e6ee176d6f12e9f2 ]
    
    In dcr-low.S we use cmpli with three arguments, instead of four
    arguments as defined in the ISA:
    
            cmpli   cr0,r3,1024
    
    This appears to be a PPC440-ism, looking at the "PPC440x5 CPU Core
    User’s Manual" it shows cmpli having no L field, but implied to be 0 due
    to the core being 32-bit. It mentions that the ISA defines four
    arguments and recommends using cmplwi.
    
    It also corresponds to the old POWER instruction set, which had no L
    field there, a reserved bit instead.
    
    dcr-low.S is only built 32-bit, because it is only built when
    DCR_NATIVE=y, which is only selected by 40x and 44x. Looking at the
    generated code (with gcc/gas) we see cmplwi as expected.
    
    Although gas is happy with the 3-argument version when building for
    32-bit, the LLVM assembler is not and errors out with:
    
      arch/powerpc/sysdev/dcr-low.S:27:10: error: invalid operand for instruction
       cmpli 0,%r3,1024; ...
               ^
    
    Switch to the cmplwi extended opcode, which avoids any confusion when
    reading the ISA, fixes the issue with the LLVM assembler, and also means
    the code could be built 64-bit in future (though that's very unlikely).

    scsi: target: Fix alua_tg_pt_gps_count tracking
    
    [ Upstream commit 1283c0d1a32bb924324481586b5d6e8e76f676ba ]
    
    We can't free the tg_pt_gp in core_alua_set_tg_pt_gp_id() because it's
    still accessed via configfs. Its release must go through the normal
    configfs/refcount process.
    
    The max alua_tg_pt_gps_count check should probably have been done in
    core_alua_allocate_tg_pt_gp(), but with the current code userspace could
    have created 0x0000ffff + 1 groups, but only set the id for 0x0000ffff.
    Then it could have deleted a group with an ID set, and then set the ID for
    that extra group and it would work ok.
    
    It's unlikely, but just in case this patch continues to allow that type of
    behavior, and just fixes the kfree() while in use bug.

    scsi: target: Fix ordered tag handling
    
    [ Upstream commit ed1227e080990ffec5bf39006ec8a57358e6689a ]
    
    This patch fixes the following bugs:
    
    1. If there are multiple ordered cmds queued and multiple simple cmds
       completing, target_restart_delayed_cmds() could be called on different
       CPUs and each instance could start a ordered cmd. They could then run in
       different orders than they were queued.
    
    2. target_restart_delayed_cmds() and target_handle_task_attr() can race
       where:
    
       1. target_handle_task_attr() has passed the simple_cmds == 0 check.
    
       2. transport_complete_task_attr() then decrements simple_cmds to 0.
    
       3. transport_complete_task_attr() runs target_restart_delayed_cmds() and
          it does not see any cmds on the delayed_cmd_list.
    
       4. target_handle_task_attr() adds the cmd to the delayed_cmd_list.
    
       The cmd will then end up timing out.
    
    3. If we are sent > 1 ordered cmds and simple_cmds == 0, we can execute
       them out of order, because target_handle_task_attr() will hit that
       simple_cmds check first and return false for all ordered cmds sent.
    
    4. We run target_restart_delayed_cmds() after every cmd completion, so if
       there is more than 1 simple cmd running, we start executing ordered cmds
       after that first cmd instead of waiting for all of them to complete.
    
    5. Ordered cmds are not supposed to start until HEAD OF QUEUE and all older
       cmds have completed, and not just simple.
    
    6. It's not a bug but it doesn't make sense to take the delayed_cmd_lock
       for every cmd completion when ordered cmds are almost never used. Just
       replacing that lock with an atomic increases IOPs by up to 10% when
       completions are spread over multiple CPUs and there are multiple
       sessions/ mqs/thread accessing the same device.
    
    This patch moves the queued delayed handling to a per device work to
    serialze the cmd executions for each device and adds a new counter to track
    HEAD_OF_QUEUE and SIMPLE cmds. We can then check the new counter to
    determine when to run the work on the completion path.

    When running ltp testcase(ltp/testcases/kernel/pty/pty04.c) with arm64, there is a soft lockup,

       worker_thread+0x180/0x430
       kthread+0x11c/0x120
    
    In the testcase pty04, The first process call the write syscall to send
    data to the pty master. At the same time, the workqueue will do the
    flush_to_ldisc to pop data in a loop until there is no more data left.
    When the sender and workqueue running in different core, the sender sends
    data fastly in full time which will result in workqueue doing work in loop
    for a long time and occuring softlockup in flush_to_ldisc with kernel
    configured without preempt. So I add need_resched check and cond_resched
    in the flush_to_ldisc loop to avoid it.

    Pointers should be printed with %p or %px rather than cast to 'unsigned
    long' and printed with %lx.
    
    Change %lx to %p to print the hashed pointer.

    scsi: lpfc: Fix list_add() corruption in lpfc_drain_txq()
    
    [ Upstream commit 99154581b05c8fb22607afb7c3d66c1bace6aa5d ]
    
    When parsing the txq list in lpfc_drain_txq(), the driver attempts to pass
    the requests to the adapter. If such an attempt fails, a local "fail_msg"
    string is set and a log message output.  The job is then added to a
    completions list for cancellation.
    
    Processing of any further jobs from the txq list continues, but since
    "fail_msg" remains set, jobs are added to the completions list regardless
    of whether a wqe was passed to the adapter.  If successfully added to
    txcmplq, jobs are added to both lists resulting in list corruption.
    
    Fix by clearing the fail_msg string after adding a job to the completions
    list. This stops the subsequent jobs from being added to the completions
    list unless they had an appropriate failure.

    parisc/entry: fix trace test in syscall exit path
    
    commit 3ec18fc7831e7d79e2d536dd1f3bc0d3ba425e8a upstream.
    
    commit 8779e05ba8aa ("parisc: Fix ptrace check on syscall return")
    fixed testing of TI_FLAGS. This uncovered a bug in the test mask.
    syscall_restore_rfi is only used when the kernel needs to exit to
    usespace with single or block stepping and the recovery counter
    enabled. The test however used _TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE_MASK, which
    includes a lot of bits that shouldn't be tested here.
    
    Fix this by using TIF_SINGLESTEP and TIF_BLOCKSTEP directly.
    
    I encountered this bug by enabling syscall tracepoints. Both in qemu and
    on real hardware. As soon as i enabled the tracepoint (sys_exit_read,
    but i guess it doesn't really matter which one), i got random page
    faults in userspace almost immediately.

    mm, oom: do not trigger out_of_memory from the #PF
    
    commit 60e2793d440a3ec95abb5d6d4fc034a4b480472d upstream.
    
    Any allocation failure during the #PF path will return with VM_FAULT_OOM
    which in turn results in pagefault_out_of_memory.  This can happen for 2
    different reasons.  a) Memcg is out of memory and we rely on
    mem_cgroup_oom_synchronize to perform the memcg OOM handling or b)
    normal allocation fails.
    
    The latter is quite problematic because allocation paths already trigger
    out_of_memory and the page allocator tries really hard to not fail
    allocations.  Anyway, if the OOM killer has been already invoked there
    is no reason to invoke it again from the #PF path.  Especially when the
    OOM condition might be gone by that time and we have no way to find out
    other than allocate.
    
    Moreover if the allocation failed and the OOM killer hasn't been invoked
    then we are unlikely to do the right thing from the #PF context because
    we have already lost the allocation context and restictions and
    therefore might oom kill a task from a different NUMA domain.
    
    This all suggests that there is no legitimate reason to trigger
    out_of_memory from pagefault_out_of_memory so drop it.  Just to be sure
    that no #PF path returns with VM_FAULT_OOM without allocation print a
    warning that this is happening before we restart the #PF.
    
    [VvS: #PF allocation can hit into limit of cgroup v1 kmem controller.
    This is a local problem related to memcg, however, it causes unnecessary
    global OOM kills that are repeated over and over again and escalate into a
    real disaster.  This has been broken since kmem accounting has been
    introduced for cgroup v1 (3.8).  There was no kmem specific reclaim for
    the separate limit so the only way to handle kmem hard limit was to return
    with ENOMEM.  In upstream the problem will be fixed by removing the
    outdated kmem limit, however stable and LTS kernels cannot do it and are
    still affected.  This patch fixes the problem and should be backported
    into stable/LTS.]

    mm, oom: pagefault_out_of_memory: don't force global OOM for dying tasks
    
    commit 0b28179a6138a5edd9d82ad2687c05b3773c387b upstream.
    
    Patch series "memcg: prohibit unconditional exceeding the limit of dying tasks", v3.
    
    Memory cgroup charging allows killed or exiting tasks to exceed the hard
    limit.  It can be misused and allowed to trigger global OOM from inside
    a memcg-limited container.  On the other hand if memcg fails allocation,
    called from inside #PF handler it triggers global OOM from inside
    pagefault_out_of_memory().
    
    To prevent these problems this patchset:
     (a) removes execution of out_of_memory() from
         pagefault_out_of_memory(), becasue nobody can explain why it is
         necessary.
     (b) allow memcg to fail allocation of dying/killed tasks.
    
    This patch (of 3):
    
    Any allocation failure during the #PF path will return with VM_FAULT_OOM
    which in turn results in pagefault_out_of_memory which in turn executes
    out_out_memory() and can kill a random task.
    
    An allocation might fail when the current task is the oom victim and
    there are no memory reserves left.  The OOM killer is already handled at
    the page allocator level for the global OOM and at the charging level
    for the memcg one.  Both have much more information about the scope of
    allocation/charge request.  This means that either the OOM killer has
    been invoked properly and didn't lead to the allocation success or it
    has been skipped because it couldn't have been invoked.  In both cases
    triggering it from here is pointless and even harmful.
    
    It makes much more sense to let the killed task die rather than to wake
    up an eternally hungry oom-killer and send him to choose a fatter victim
    for breakfast.

    ARM: 9156/1: drop cc-option fallbacks for architecture selection
    
    commit 418ace9992a7647c446ed3186df40cf165b67298 upstream.
    
    Naresh and Antonio ran into a build failure with latest Debian
    armhf compilers, with lots of output like
    
     tmp/ccY3nOAs.s:2215: Error: selected processor does not support `cpsid i' in ARM mode
    
    As it turns out, $(cc-option) fails early here when the FPU is not
    selected before CPU architecture is selected, as the compiler
    option check runs before enabling -msoft-float, which causes
    a problem when testing a target architecture level without an FPU:
    
    cc1: error: '-mfloat-abi=hard': selected architecture lacks an FPU
    
    Passing e.g. -march=armv6k+fp in place of -march=armv6k would avoid this
    issue, but the fallback logic is already broken because all supported
    compilers (gcc-5 and higher) are much more recent than these options,
    and building with -march=armv5t as a fallback no longer works.
    
    The best way forward that I see is to just remove all the checks, which
    also has the nice side-effect of slightly improving the startup time for
    'make'.
    
    The -mtune=marvell-f option was apparently never supported by any mainline
    compiler, and the custom Codesourcery gcc build that did support is
    now too old to build kernels, so just use -mtune=xscale unconditionally
    for those.
    
    This should be safe to apply on all stable kernels, and will be required
    in order to keep building them with gcc-11 and higher.

    Chipidea core was calling the interrupt handler from non-IRQ context
    with interrupts enabled, something which can lead to a deadlock if
    there's an actual interrupt trying to take a lock that's already held
    (e.g. the controller lock in udc_irq()).
    
    Add a wrapper that can be used to fake interrupts instead of calling the
    handler directly.

    [ Upstream commit c7cd82b90599fa10915f41e3dd9098a77d0aa7b6 ]

    skb is already freed by dev_kfree_skb in pn533_fill_fragment_skbs,
    but follow error handler branch when pn533_fill_fragment_skbs()
    fails, skb is freed again, results in double free issue. Fix this
    by not free skb in error path of pn533_fill_fragment_skbs.

    llc: fix out-of-bound array index in llc_sk_dev_hash()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ac9dfd58b138f7e82098a4e0a0d46858b12215b ]
    
    Both ifindex and LLC_SK_DEV_HASH_ENTRIES are signed.
    
    This means that (ifindex % LLC_SK_DEV_HASH_ENTRIES) is negative
    if @ifindex is negative.
    
    We could simply make LLC_SK_DEV_HASH_ENTRIES unsigned.
    
    In this patch I chose to use hash_32() to get more entropy
    from @ifindex, like llc_sk_laddr_hashfn().

    mm/zsmalloc.c: close race window between zs_pool_dec_isolated() and zs_unregister_migration()
    
    [ Upstream commit afe8605ca45424629fdddfd85984b442c763dc47 ]
    
    There is one possible race window between zs_pool_dec_isolated() and
    zs_unregister_migration() because wait_for_isolated_drain() checks the
    isolated count without holding class->lock and there is no order inside
    zs_pool_dec_isolated().  Thus the below race window could be possible:
    
      zs_pool_dec_isolated          zs_unregister_migration
        check pool->destroying != 0
                                      pool->destroying = true;
                                      smp_mb();
                                      wait_for_isolated_drain()
                                        wait for pool->isolated_pages == 0
        atomic_long_dec(&pool->isolated_pages);
        atomic_long_read(&pool->isolated_pages) == 0
    
    Since we observe the pool->destroying (false) before atomic_long_dec()
    for pool->isolated_pages, waking pool->migration_wait up is missed.
    
    Fix this by ensure checking pool->destroying happens after the
    atomic_long_dec(&pool->isolated_pages).

    Put new_slave in bond_sysfs_slave_add() will cause use-after-free problems
    when new_slave is accessed in the subsequent error handling process. Since
    new_slave will be put in the subsequent error handling process, remove the
    unnecessary put to fix it.
    In addition, when sysfs_create_file() fails, if some files have been crea-
    ted successfully, we need to call sysfs_remove_file() to remove them.
    Since there are sysfs_create_files() & sysfs_remove_files() can be used,
    use these two functions instead.

    ACPI: PMIC: Fix intel_pmic_regs_handler() read accesses
    
    [ Upstream commit 009a789443fe4c8e6b1ecb7c16b4865c026184cd ]
    
    The handling of PMIC register reads through writing 0 to address 4
    of the OpRegion is wrong. Instead of returning the read value
    through the value64, which is a no-op for function == ACPI_WRITE calls,
    store the value and then on a subsequent function == ACPI_READ with
    address == 3 (the address for the value field of the OpRegion)
    return the stored value.
    
    This has been tested on a Xiaomi Mi Pad 2 and makes the ACPI battery dev
    there mostly functional (unfortunately there are still other issues).
    
    Here are the SET() / GET() functions of the PMIC ACPI device,
    which use this OpRegion, which clearly show the new behavior to
    be correct:
    
    OperationRegion (REGS, 0x8F, Zero, 0x50)
    Field (REGS, ByteAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
    {
        CLNT,   8,

                GPRW = Zero
            }

    This patch allows to use 0 for `coal->rx_coalesce_usecs` param to
    disable rx irq coalescing.
    
    Previously we could enable rx irq coalescing via ethtool
    (For ex: `ethtool -C eth0 rx-usecs 2000`) but we couldn't disable
    it because this part rejects 0 value:
    
           if (!coal->rx_coalesce_usecs)
                   return -EINVAL;

    A successful 'clk_prepare()' call should be balanced by a corresponding
    'clk_unprepare()' call in the error handling path of the probe, as already
    done in the remove function.
    
    More specifically, 'clk_prepare_enable()' is used, but 'clk_disable()' is
    also already called. So just the unprepare step has still to be done.
    
    Update the error handling path accordingly.

    scsi: qla2xxx: Turn off target reset during issue_lip
    
    [ Upstream commit 0b7a9fd934a68ebfc1019811b7bdc1742072ad7b ]
    
    When user uses issue_lip to do link bounce, driver sends additional target
    reset to remote device before resetting the link. The target reset would
    affect other paths with active I/Os. This patch will remove the unnecessary
    target reset.

    The fintek watchdog timer can configure timeouts of second granularity
    only up to 255 seconds. Beyond that, the timeout needs to be configured
    with minute granularity. WDIOC_GETTIMEOUT should report the actual
    timeout configured, not just echo back the timeout configured by the
    user. Do so.

    m68k: set a default value for MEMORY_RESERVE

    'make randconfig' can produce a .config file with

    When a subsequent 'make all' is done, kconfig restarts the config
    and prompts for a value for MEMORY_RESERVE. This breaks

    dmaengine: dmaengine_desc_callback_valid(): Check for `callback_result`
    
    [ Upstream commit e7e1e880b114ca640a2f280b0d5d38aed98f98c6 ]
    
    Before the `callback_result` callback was introduced drivers coded their
    invocation to the callback in a similar way to:
    
            if (cb->callback) {
                    spin_unlock(&dma->lock);
                    cb->callback(cb->callback_param);
                    spin_lock(&dma->lock);
            }
    
    With the introduction of `callback_result` two helpers where introduced to
    transparently handle both types of callbacks. And drivers where updated to
    look like this:
    
            if (dmaengine_desc_callback_valid(cb)) {
                    spin_unlock(&dma->lock);
                    dmaengine_desc_callback_invoke(cb, ...);
                    spin_lock(&dma->lock);
            }
    
    dmaengine_desc_callback_invoke() correctly handles both `callback_result`
    and `callback`. But we forgot to update the dmaengine_desc_callback_valid()
    function to check for `callback_result`. As a result DMA descriptors that
    use the `callback_result` rather than `callback` don't have their callback
    invoked by drivers that follow the pattern above.
    
    Fix this by checking for both `callback` and `callback_result` in
    dmaengine_desc_callback_valid().

    auxdisplay: img-ascii-lcd: Fix lock-up when displaying empty string
    
    [ Upstream commit afcb5a811ff3ab3969f09666535eb6018a160358 ]
    
    While writing an empty string to a device attribute is a no-op, and thus
    does not need explicit safeguards, the user can still write a single
    newline to an attribute file:
    
        echo > .../message
    
    If that happens, img_ascii_lcd_display() trims the newline, yielding an
    empty string, and causing an infinite loop in img_ascii_lcd_scroll().
    
    Fix this by adding a check for empty strings.  Clear the display in case
    one is encountered.

    serial: xilinx_uartps: Fix race condition causing stuck TX
    
    [ Upstream commit 88b20f84f0fe47409342669caf3e58a3fc64c316 ]
    
    xilinx_uartps .start_tx() clears TXEMPTY when enabling TXEMPTY to avoid
    any previous TXEVENT event asserting the UART interrupt. This clear
    operation is done immediately after filling the TX FIFO.
    
    However, if the bytes inserted by cdns_uart_handle_tx() are consumed by
    the UART before the TXEMPTY is cleared, the clear operation eats the new
    TXEMPTY event as well, causing cdns_uart_isr() to never receive the
    TXEMPTY event. If there are bytes still queued in circbuf, TX will get
    stuck as they will never get transferred to FIFO (unless new bytes are
    queued to circbuf in which case .start_tx() is called again).
    
    While the racy missed TXEMPTY occurs fairly often with short data
    sequences (e.g. write 1 byte), in those cases circbuf is usually empty
    so no action on TXEMPTY would have been needed anyway. On the other
    hand, longer data sequences make the race much more unlikely as UART
    takes longer to consume the TX FIFO. Therefore it is rare for this race
    to cause visible issues in general.
    
    Fix the race by clearing the TXEMPTY bit in ISR *before* filling the
    FIFO.
    
    The TXEMPTY bit in ISR will only get asserted at the exact moment the
    TX FIFO *becomes* empty, so clearing the bit before filling FIFO does
    not cause an extra immediate assertion even if the FIFO is initially
    empty.
    
    This is hard to reproduce directly on a normal system, but inserting
    e.g. udelay(200) after cdns_uart_handle_tx(port), setting 4000000 baud,
    and then running "dd if=/dev/zero bs=128 of=/dev/ttyPS0 count=50"
    reliably reproduces the issue on my ZynqMP test system unless this fix
    is applied.

    conversion.  The problem is that the last byte is not initialized.  After
    the conversion is completely done, the last byte is discarded so it doesn't
    cause a problem.  But static checkers and the KMSan runtime checker can
    detect the uninitialized read and will complain about it.

    This is due to 'dcbz' instruction being used on non-cached memory.
    'dcbz' instruction is used by memset() to zeroize a complete
    cacheline at once, and memset() is not expected to be used on non
    cached memory.
    
    When performing a 'sparse' check on fbdev driver, it also appears
    that the use of memset() is unexpected:
    
      drivers/video/fbdev/chipsfb.c:334:17: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)

    Use fb_memset() instead of memset(). fb_memset() is defined as
    memset_io() for powerpc.

    memory: fsl_ifc: fix leak of irq and nand_irq in fsl_ifc_ctrl_probe
    
    [ Upstream commit 4ed2f3545c2e5acfbccd7f85fea5b1a82e9862d7 ]
    
    The error handling code of fsl_ifc_ctrl_probe is problematic. When
    fsl_ifc_ctrl_init fails or request_irq of fsl_ifc_ctrl_dev->irq fails,
    it forgets to free the irq and nand_irq. Meanwhile, if request_irq of
    fsl_ifc_ctrl_dev->nand_irq fails, it will still free nand_irq even if
    the request_irq is not successful.
    
    Fix this by refactoring the error handling code.

    crypto: pcrypt - Delay write to padata->info
    
    [ Upstream commit 68b6dea802cea0dbdd8bd7ccc60716b5a32a5d8a ]
    
    These three events can race when pcrypt is used multiple times in a
    template ("pcrypt(pcrypt(...))"):
    
      1.  [taskA] The caller makes the crypto request via crypto_aead_encrypt()
      2.  [kworkerB] padata serializes the inner pcrypt request
      3.  [kworkerC] padata serializes the outer pcrypt request
    
    3 might finish before the call to crypto_aead_encrypt() returns in 1,
    resulting in two possible issues.
    
    First, a use-after-free of the crypto request's memory when, for
    example, taskA writes to the outer pcrypt request's padata->info in
    pcrypt_aead_enc() after kworkerC completes the request.
    
    Second, the outer pcrypt request overwrites the inner pcrypt request's
    return code with -EINPROGRESS, making a successful request appear to
    fail.  For instance, kworkerB writes the outer pcrypt request's
    padata->info in pcrypt_aead_done() and then taskA overwrites it
    in pcrypt_aead_enc().
    
    Avoid both situations by delaying the write of padata->info until after
    the inner crypto request's return code is checked.  This prevents the
    use-after-free by not touching the crypto request's memory after the
    next-inner crypto request is made, and stops padata->info from being
    overwritten.

    irq: mips: avoid nested irq_enter()
    
    [ Upstream commit c65b52d02f6c1a06ddb20cba175ad49eccd6410d ]
    
    As bcm6345_l1_irq_handle() is a chained irqchip handler, it will be
    invoked within the context of the root irqchip handler, which must have
    entered IRQ context already.
    
    When bcm6345_l1_irq_handle() calls arch/mips's do_IRQ() , this will nest
    another call to irq_enter(), and the resulting nested increment to
    `rcu_data.dynticks_nmi_nesting` will cause rcu_is_cpu_rrupt_from_idle()
    to fail to identify wakeups from idle, resulting in failure to preempt,
    and RCU stalls.
    
    Chained irqchip handlers must invoke IRQ handlers by way of thee core
    irqchip code, i.e. generic_handle_irq() or generic_handle_domain_irq()
    and should not call do_IRQ(), which is intended only for root irqchip
    handlers.
    
    Fix bcm6345_l1_irq_handle() by calling generic_handle_irq() directly.

    phy: micrel: ksz8041nl: do not use power down mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 2641b62d2fab52648e34cdc6994b2eacde2d27c1 ]
    
    Some Micrel KSZ8041NL PHY chips exhibit continuous RX errors after using
    the power down mode bit (0.11). If the PHY is taken out of power down
    mode in a certain temperature range, the PHY enters a weird state which
    leads to continuously reporting RX errors. In that state, the MAC is not
    able to receive or send any Ethernet frames and the activity LED is
    constantly blinking. Since Linux is using the suspend callback when the
    interface is taken down, ending up in that state can easily happen
    during a normal startup.
    
    Micrel confirmed the issue in errata DS80000700A [*], caused by abnormal
    clock recovery when using power down mode. Even the latest revision (A4,
    Revision ID 0x1513) seems to suffer that problem, and according to the
    errata is not going to be fixed.
    
    Remove the suspend/resume callback to avoid using the power down mode
    completely.

    setting the initiator bit when sending DELBA requests to the AP: While
    we set the bit on our del_ba_param_set bitmask, we forget to actually
    copy that bitmask over to the command struct, which means we never
    actually set the initiator bit.
    
    Fix that and copy the bitmask over to the host_cmd_ds_11n_delba command

    net: stream: don't purge sk_error_queue in sk_stream_kill_queues()
    
    [ Upstream commit 24bcbe1cc69fa52dc4f7b5b2456678ed464724d8 ]
    
    sk_stream_kill_queues() can be called on close when there are
    still outstanding skbs to transmit. Those skbs may try to queue
    notifications to the error queue (e.g. timestamps).
    If sk_stream_kill_queues() purges the queue without taking
    its lock the queue may get corrupted, and skbs leaked.
    
    This shows up as a warning about an rmem leak:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 24 PID: 0 at net/ipv4/af_inet.c:154 inet_sock_destruct+0x...
    
    The leak is always a multiple of 0x300 bytes (the value is in
    %rax on my builds, so RAX: 0000000000000300). 0x300 is truesize of
    an empty sk_buff. Indeed if we dump the socket state at the time
    of the warning the sk_error_queue is often (but not always)
    corrupted. The ->next pointer points back at the list head,
    but not the ->prev pointer. Indeed we can find the leaked skb
    by scanning the kernel memory for something that looks like
    an skb with ->sk = socket in question, and ->truesize = 0x300.
    The contents of ->cb[] of the skb confirms the suspicion that
    it is indeed a timestamp notification (as generated in
    __skb_complete_tx_timestamp()).
    
    Removing purging of sk_error_queue should be okay, since
    inet_sock_destruct() does it again once all socket refs
    are gone. Eric suggests this may cause sockets that go
    thru disconnect() to maintain notifications from the
    previous incarnations of the socket, but that should be
    okay since the race was there anyway, and disconnect()
    is not exactly dependable.
    
    Thanks to Jonathan Lemon and Omar Sandoval for help at various
    stages of tracing the issue.

    been initialized which happens immediately after this call in the

    In the msm_gem_import() function the "obj" pointer is uninitialized, so

    steps). This isn't the case for max_antenna_gain - which is still expected
    by the firmware as dB.
    
    The firmware is converting it from dB to the internal (twicepower)
    representation when it calculates the limits of a channel. This can be seen
    in tpc_stats when configuring "12" as max_antenna_gain. Instead of the
    expected 12 (6 dB), the tpc_stats shows 24 (12 dB).
    
    Tested on QCA9888 and IPQ4019 with firmware 10.4-3.5.3-00057.

    When device_register() returns an error, the name allocated in

    [ Upstream commit beae4a6258e64af609ad5995cc6b6056eb0d898e ]
    
    The "msh" pointer is device managed, meaning that memstick_alloc_host()
    calls device_initialize() on it.  That means that it can't be free
    using kfree() but must instead be freed with memstick_free_host().
    Otherwise it leads to a tiny memory leak of device resources.

    ath9k: Fix potential interrupt storm on queue reset
    
    [ Upstream commit 4925642d541278575ad1948c5924d71ffd57ef14 ]
    
    In tests with two Lima boards from 8devices (QCA4531 based) on OpenWrt
    19.07 we could force a silent restart of a device with no serial
    output when we were sending a high amount of UDP traffic (iperf3 at 80
    MBit/s in both directions from external hosts, saturating the wifi and
    causing a load of about 4.5 to 6) and were then triggering an
    ath9k_queue_reset().
    
    Further debugging showed that the restart was caused by the ath79
    watchdog. With disabled watchdog we could observe that the device was
    constantly going into ath_isr() interrupt handler and was returning
    early after the ATH_OP_HW_RESET flag test, without clearing any
    interrupts. Even though ath9k_queue_reset() calls
    ath9k_hw_kill_interrupts().
    
    With JTAG we could observe the following race condition:
    
    1) ath9k_queue_reset()
       ...
       -> ath9k_hw_kill_interrupts()
       -> set_bit(ATH_OP_HW_RESET, &common->op_flags);
       ...
       <- returns
    
          2) ath9k_tasklet()
             ...
             -> ath9k_hw_resume_interrupts()
             ...
             <- returns
    
                     3) loops around:
                        ...
                        handle_int()
                        -> ath_isr()
                           ...
                           -> if (test_bit(ATH_OP_HW_RESET,
                                           &common->op_flags))
                                return IRQ_HANDLED;
    
                        x) ath_reset_internal():
                           => never reached <=
    
    And in ath_isr() we would typically see the following interrupts /
    interrupt causes:
    
    * status: 0x00111030 or 0x00110030
    * async_cause: 2 (AR_INTR_MAC_IPQ)
    * sync_cause: 0
    
    So the ath9k_tasklet() reenables the ath9k interrupts
    through ath9k_hw_resume_interrupts() which ath9k_queue_reset() had just
    disabled. And ath_isr() then keeps firing because it returns IRQ_HANDLED
    without actually clearing the interrupt.
    
    To fix this IRQ storm also clear/disable the interrupts again when we
    are in reset state.

    It was caused by the fact that rebind_subsystem() disables
    controllers to be rebound one by one. If more than one disabled
    controllers are originally from the default hierarchy, it means that
    cgroup_apply_control_disable() will be called multiple times for the
    same default hierarchy. A controller may be killed by css_kill() in
    the first round. In the second round, the killed controller may not be
    completely dead yet leading to the warning.
    
    To avoid this problem, we collect all the ssid's of controllers that
    needed to be disabled from the default hierarchy and then disable them
    in one go instead of one by one.

    parisc/kgdb: add kgdb_roundup() to make kgdb work with idle polling
    
    [ Upstream commit 66e29fcda1824f0427966fbee2bd2c85bf362c82 ]
    
    With idle polling, IPIs are not sent when a CPU idle, but queued
    and run later from do_idle(). The default kgdb_call_nmi_hook()
    implementation gets the pointer to struct pt_regs from get_irq_reqs(),
    which doesn't work in that case because it was not called from the
    IPI interrupt handler. Fix it by defining our own kgdb_roundup()
    function which sents an IPI_ENTER_KGDB. When that IPI is received
    on the target CPU kgdb_nmicallback() is called.

    ARM: 9136/1: ARMv7-M uses BE-8, not BE-32
    
    [ Upstream commit 345dac33f58894a56d17b92a41be10e16585ceff ]
    
    When configuring the kernel for big-endian, we set either BE-8 or BE-32
    based on the CPU architecture level. Until linux-4.4, we did not have
    any ARMv7-M platform allowing big-endian builds, but now i.MX/Vybrid
    is in that category, adn we get a build error because of this:
    
    arch/arm/kernel/module-plts.c: In function 'get_module_plt':
    arch/arm/kernel/module-plts.c:60:46: error: implicit declaration of function '__opcode_to_mem_thumb32' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
    
    This comes down to picking the wrong default, ARMv7-M uses BE8
    like ARMv7-A does. Changing the default gets the kernel to compile
    and presumably works.

    ARM: clang: Do not rely on lr register for stacktrace
    
    [ Upstream commit b3ea5d56f212ad81328c82454829a736197ebccc ]
    
    Currently the stacktrace on clang compiled arm kernel uses the 'lr'
    register to find the first frame address from pt_regs. However, that
    is wrong after calling another function, because the 'lr' register
    is used by 'bl' instruction and never be recovered.
    
    As same as gcc arm kernel, directly use the frame pointer (r11) of
    the pt_regs to find the first frame address.
    
    Note that this fixes kretprobe stacktrace issue only with
    CONFIG_UNWINDER_FRAME_POINTER=y. For the CONFIG_UNWINDER_ARM,
    we need another fix.

    mwl8k: Fix use-after-free in mwl8k_fw_state_machine()
    
    [ Upstream commit 257051a235c17e33782b6e24a4b17f2d7915aaec ]
    
    When the driver fails to request the firmware, it calls its error
    handler. In the error handler, the driver detaches device from driver
    first before releasing the firmware, which can cause a use-after-free bug.
    
    Fix this by releasing firmware first.

    tracing/cfi: Fix cmp_entries_* functions signature mismatch
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ce1bb83a14019f8c396d57ec704d19478747716 ]
    
    If CONFIG_CFI_CLANG=y, attempting to read an event histogram will cause
    the kernel to panic due to failed CFI check.
    
        1. echo 'hist:keys=common_pid' >> events/sched/sched_switch/trigger
        2. cat events/sched/sched_switch/hist
        3. kernel panics on attempting to read hist
    
    This happens because the sort() function expects a generic
    int (*)(const void *, const void *) pointer for the compare function.
    To prevent this CFI failure, change tracing map cmp_entries_* function
    signatures to match this.
    
    Also, fix the build error reported by the kernel test robot [1].

    lib/xz: Validate the value before assigning it to an enum variable
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f8d7abaa413c34da9d751289849dbfb7c977d05 ]
    
    This might matter, for example, if the underlying type of enum xz_check
    was a signed char. In such a case the validation wouldn't have caught an
    unsupported header. I don't know if this problem can occur in the kernel
    on any arch but it's still good to fix it because some people might copy
    the XZ code to their own projects from Linux instead of the upstream
    XZ Embedded repository.
    
    This change may increase the code size by a few bytes. An alternative
    would have been to use an unsigned int instead of enum xz_check but
    using an enumeration looks cleaner.

    lib/xz: Avoid overlapping memcpy() with invalid input with in-place decompression
    
    [ Upstream commit 83d3c4f22a36d005b55f44628f46cc0d319a75e8 ]
    
    With valid files, the safety margin described in lib/decompress_unxz.c
    ensures that these buffers cannot overlap. But if the uncompressed size
    of the input is larger than the caller thought, which is possible when
    the input file is invalid/corrupt, the buffers can overlap. Obviously
    the result will then be garbage (and usually the decoder will return
    an error too) but no other harm will happen when such an over-run occurs.
    
    This change only affects uncompressed LZMA2 chunks and so this
    should have no effect on performance.

    [ Upstream commit 2835f327bd1240508db2c89fe94a056faa53c49a ]
    
    Some buggy firmware and/or brand new batteries can support a charge that's
    slightly over the reported design capacity. In such cases, the kernel will
    report to userspace that the charging state of the battery is "Unknown",
    when in reality the battery charge is "Full", at least from the design
    capacity point of view. Make the fallback condition accepts capacities
    over the designed capacity so userspace knows that is full.

    kzalloc() is used to allocate memory for cd->detectors, and if it fails,

    To fix this possible null-pointer dereference, check cd->detectors before
    the for loop to dereference cd->detectors.

    tracefs: Have tracefs directories not set OTH permission bits by default
    
    [ Upstream commit 49d67e445742bbcb03106b735b2ab39f6e5c56bc ]
    
    The tracefs file system is by default mounted such that only root user can
    access it. But there are legitimate reasons to create a group and allow
    those added to the group to have access to tracing. By changing the
    permissions of the tracefs mount point to allow access, it will allow
    group access to the tracefs directory.
    
    There should not be any real reason to allow all access to the tracefs
    directory as it contains sensitive information. Have the default
    permission of directories being created not have any OTH (other) bits set,
    such that an admin that wants to give permission to a group has to first
    disable all OTH bits in the file system.

    ACPICA: Avoid evaluating methods too early during system resume
    
    [ Upstream commit d3c4b6f64ad356c0d9ddbcf73fa471e6a841cc5c ]
    
    ACPICA commit 0762982923f95eb652cf7ded27356b247c9774de
    
    During wakeup from system-wide sleep states, acpi_get_sleep_type_data()
    is called and it tries to get memory from the slab allocator in order
    to evaluate a control method, but if KFENCE is enabled in the kernel,
    the memory allocation attempt causes an IRQ work to be queued and a
    self-IPI to be sent to the CPU running the code which requires the
    memory controller to be ready, so if that happens too early in the
    wakeup path, it doesn't work.
    
    Prevent that from taking place by calling acpi_get_sleep_type_data()
    for S0 upfront, when preparing to enter a given sleep state, and
    saving the data obtained by it for later use during system wakeup.

    When CONFIG_PRINTK is not set, the CMPXCHG_BUGCHECK() macro calls
    _printk(), but _printk() is a static inline function, not available

    make this config option depend on PRINTK.

    media: mt9p031: Fix corrupted frame after restarting stream
    
    [ Upstream commit 0961ba6dd211a4a52d1dd4c2d59be60ac2dc08c7 ]
    
    To prevent corrupted frames after starting and stopping the sensor its
    datasheet specifies a specific pause sequence to follow:
    
    Stopping:
            Set Pause_Restart Bit -> Set Restart Bit -> Set Chip_Enable Off
    
    Restarting:
            Set Chip_Enable On -> Clear Pause_Restart Bit
    
    The Restart Bit is cleared automatically and must not be cleared
    manually as this would cause undefined behavior.

    x86: Increase exception stack sizes
    
    [ Upstream commit 7fae4c24a2b84a66c7be399727aca11e7a888462 ]
    
    It turns out that a single page of stack is trivial to overflow with
    all the tracing gunk enabled. Raise the exception stacks to 2 pages,
    which is still half the interrupt stacks, which are at 4 pages.

    smackfs: Fix use-after-free in netlbl_catmap_walk()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0817534ff9ea809fac1322c5c8c574be8483ea57 ]
    
    Syzkaller reported use-after-free bug as described in [1]. The bug is
    triggered when smk_set_cipso() tries to free stale category bitmaps
    while there are concurrent reader(s) using the same bitmaps.
    
    Wait for RCU grace period to finish before freeing the category bitmaps
    in smk_set_cipso(). This makes sure that there are no more readers using
    the stale bitmaps and freeing them should be safe.

    [ Upstream commit 5ca9ce2ba4d5884cd94d1a856c675ab1242cd242 ]
    
    Different SoCs have a different number of channels, e.g .:
    * amazon-se has 10 channels,
    * danube+ar9 have 20 channels,
    * vr9 has 28 channels,
    * ar10 has 24 channels.
    
    We can read the ID register and, depending on the reported
    number of channels, reset the appropriate number of channels.

    [ Upstream commit 1975718c488a39128f1f515b23ae61a5a214cc3d ]
    
    Previously, `__query_block()` would fail if the
    second WCxx method call failed. However, the
    WQxx method might have succeeded, and potentially
    allocated memory for the result. Instead of
    throwing away the result and potentially
    leaking memory, ignore the result of
    the second WCxx call.

    In our case, there are two Thread A and B:

    l2cap_chan_timeout()            __se_sys_shutdown()
      l2cap_chan_close()              l2cap_sock_shutdown()

          l2cap_sock_teardown_cb()        l2cap_sock_teardown_cb()
    
    Once l2cap_sock_teardown_cb() excuted, this sock will be marked as SOCK_ZAPPED,
    and can be treated as killable in l2cap_sock_kill() if sock_orphan() has
    excuted, at this time we close sock through sock_close() which end to call
    l2cap_sock_kill() like Thread C:
    
    Context: Thread C:
    
    sock_close()
      l2cap_sock_release()
        sock_orphan()
        l2cap_sock_kill()  #free sock if refcnt is 1
    
    If C completed, Once A or B reaches l2cap_sock_teardown_cb() again,
    use-after-free happened.
    
    We should set chan->data to NULL if sock is destructed, for telling teardown
    operation is not allowed in l2cap_sock_teardown_cb(), and also we should
    avoid killing an already killed socket in l2cap_sock_close_cb().

    Bluetooth: sco: Fix lock_sock() blockage by memcpy_from_msg()
    
    [ Upstream commit 99c23da0eed4fd20cae8243f2b51e10e66aa0951 ]
    
    The sco_send_frame() also takes lock_sock() during memcpy_from_msg()
    call that may be endlessly blocked by a task with userfaultd
    technique, and this will result in a hung task watchdog trigger.
    
    Just like the similar fix for hci_sock_sendmsg() in commit
    92c685dc5de0 ("Bluetooth: reorganize functions..."), this patch moves
    the  memcpy_from_msg() out of lock_sock() for addressing the hang.
    
    This should be the last piece for fixing CVE-2021-3640 after a few
    already queued fixes.

    iio: dac: ad5446: Fix ad5622_write() return value
    
    commit 558df982d4ead9cac628153d0d7b60feae05ddc8 upstream.
    
    On success i2c_master_send() returns the number of bytes written. The
    call from iio_write_channel_info(), however, expects the return value to
    be zero on success.
    
    This bug causes incorrect consumption of the sysfs buffer in
    iio_write_channel_info(). When writing more than two characters to
    out_voltage0_raw, the ad5446 write handler is called multiple times
    causing unexpected behavior.

    quota: check block number when reading the block in quota file
    
    commit 9bf3d20331295b1ecb81f4ed9ef358c51699a050 upstream.
    
    The block number in the quota tree on disk should be smaller than the
    v2_disk_dqinfo.dqi_blocks. If the quota file was corrupted, we may be
    allocating an 'allocated' block and that would lead to a loop in a tree,
    which will probably trigger oops later. This patch adds a check for the
    block number in the quota tree to prevent such potential issue.

    ALSA: mixer: oss: Fix racy access to slots
    
    commit 411cef6adfb38a5bb6bd9af3941b28198e7fb680 upstream.
    
    The OSS mixer can reassign the mapping slots dynamically via proc
    file.  Although the addition and deletion of those slots are protected
    by mixer->reg_mutex, the access to slots aren't, hence this may cause
    UAF when the slots in use are deleted concurrently.
    
    This patch applies the mixer->reg_mutex in all appropriate code paths
    (i.e. the ioctl functions) that may access slots.

    serial: core: Fix initializing and restoring termios speed
    
    commit 027b57170bf8bb6999a28e4a5f3d78bf1db0f90c upstream.
    
    Since commit edc6afc54968 ("tty: switch to ktermios and new framework")
    termios speed is no longer stored only in c_cflag member but also in new
    additional c_ispeed and c_ospeed members. If BOTHER flag is set in c_cflag
    then termios speed is stored only in these new members.
    
    Therefore to correctly restore termios speed it is required to store also
    ispeed and ospeed members, not only cflag member.
    
    In case only cflag member with BOTHER flag is restored then functions
    tty_termios_baud_rate() and tty_termios_input_baud_rate() returns baudrate
    stored in c_ospeed / c_ispeed member, which is zero as it was not restored
    too. If reported baudrate is invalid (e.g. zero) then serial core functions
    report fallback baudrate value 9600. So it means that in this case original
    baudrate is lost and kernel changes it to value 9600.
    
    Simple reproducer of this issue is to boot kernel with following command
    line argument: "console=ttyXXX,86400" (where ttyXXX is the device name).
    For speed 86400 there is no Bnnn constant and therefore kernel has to
    represent this speed via BOTHER c_cflag. Which means that speed is stored
    only in c_ospeed and c_ispeed members, not in c_cflag anymore.
    
    If bootloader correctly configures serial device to speed 86400 then kernel
    prints boot log to early console at speed speed 86400 without any issue.
    But after kernel starts initializing real console device ttyXXX then speed
    is changed to fallback value 9600 because information about speed was lost.
    
    This patch fixes above issue by storing and restoring also ispeed and
    ospeed members, which are required for BOTHER flag.

    power: supply: max17042_battery: use VFSOC for capacity when no rsns
    
    commit 223a3b82834f036a62aa831f67cbf1f1d644c6e2 upstream.
    
    On Galaxy S3 (i9300/i9305), which has the max17047 fuel gauge and no
    current sense resistor (rsns), the RepSOC register does not provide an
    accurate state of charge value. The reported value is wrong, and does
    not change over time. VFSOC however, which uses the voltage fuel gauge
    to determine the state of charge, always shows an accurate value.
    
    For devices without current sense, VFSOC is already used for the
    soc-alert (0x0003 is written to MiscCFG register), so with this change
    the source of the alert and the PROP_CAPACITY value match.

    signal/mips: Update (_save|_restore)_fp_context to fail with -EFAULT
    
    commit 95bf9d646c3c3f95cb0be7e703b371db8da5be68 upstream.
    
    When an instruction to save or restore a register from the stack fails
    in _save_fp_context or _restore_fp_context return with -EFAULT.  This
    change was made to r2300_fpu.S[1] but it looks like it got lost with
    the introduction of EX2[2].  This is also what the other implementation
    of _save_fp_context and _restore_fp_context in r4k_fpu.S does, and
    what is needed for the callers to be able to handle the error.
    
    Furthermore calling do_exit(SIGSEGV) from bad_stack is wrong because
    it does not terminate the entire process it just terminates a single
    thread.
    
    As the changed code was the only caller of arch/mips/kernel/syscall.c:bad_stack
    remove the problematic and now unused helper function.

    signal: Remove the bogus sigkill_pending in ptrace_stop
    
    commit 7d613f9f72ec8f90ddefcae038fdae5adb8404b3 upstream.
    
    The existence of sigkill_pending is a little silly as it is
    functionally a duplicate of fatal_signal_pending that is used in
    exactly one place.
    
    Checking for pending fatal signals and returning early in ptrace_stop
    is actively harmful.  It casues the ptrace_stop called by
    ptrace_signal to return early before setting current->exit_code.
    Later when ptrace_signal reads the signal number from
    current->exit_code is undefined, making it unpredictable what will
    happen.
    
    Instead rely on the fact that schedule will not sleep if there is a
    pending signal that can awaken a task.
    
    Removing the explict sigkill_pending test fixes fixes ptrace_signal
    when ptrace_stop does not stop because current->exit_code is always
    set to to signr.

    mwifiex: Read a PCI register after writing the TX ring write pointer
    
    commit e5f4eb8223aa740237cd463246a7debcddf4eda1 upstream.
    
    On the 88W8897 PCIe+USB card the firmware randomly crashes after setting
    the TX ring write pointer. The issue is present in the latest firmware
    version 15.68.19.p21 of the PCIe+USB card.
    
    Those firmware crashes can be worked around by reading any PCI register
    of the card after setting that register, so read the PCI_VENDOR_ID
    register here. The reason this works is probably because we keep the bus
    from entering an ASPM state for a bit longer, because that's what causes
    the cards firmware to crash.
    
    This fixes a bug where during RX/TX traffic and with ASPM L1 substates
    enabled (the specific substates where the issue happens appear to be
    platform dependent), the firmware crashes and eventually a command
    timeout appears in the logs.

    mwifiex: fix division by zero in fw download path
    
    commit 89f8765a11d8df49296d92c404067f9b5c58ee26 upstream.
    
    Add the missing endpoint sanity checks to probe() to avoid division by
    zero in mwifiex_write_data_sync() in case a malicious device has broken
    descriptors (or when doing descriptor fuzz testing).
    
    Only add checks for the firmware-download boot stage, which require both
    command endpoints, for now. The driver looks like it will handle a
    missing endpoint during normal operation without oopsing, albeit not
    very gracefully as it will try to submit URBs to the default pipe and
    fail.
    
    Note that USB core will reject URBs submitted for endpoints with zero
    wMaxPacketSize but that drivers doing packet-size calculations still
    need to handle this (cf. commit 2548288b4fb0 ("USB: Fix: Don't skip
    endpoint descriptors with maxpacket=0")).

    regulator: s5m8767: do not use reset value as DVS voltage if GPIO DVS is disabled
    
    commit b16bef60a9112b1e6daf3afd16484eb06e7ce792 upstream.
    
    The driver and its bindings, before commit 04f9f068a619 ("regulator:
    s5m8767: Modify parsing method of the voltage table of buck2/3/4") were
    requiring to provide at least one safe/default voltage for DVS registers
    if DVS GPIO is not being enabled.
    
    IOW, if s5m8767,pmic-buck2-uses-gpio-dvs is missing, the
    s5m8767,pmic-buck2-dvs-voltage should still be present and contain one
    voltage.
    
    This requirement was coming from driver behavior matching this condition
    (none of DVS GPIO is enabled): it was always initializing the DVS
    selector pins to 0 and keeping the DVS enable setting at reset value
    (enabled).  Therefore if none of DVS GPIO is enabled in devicetree,
    driver was configuring the first DVS voltage for buck[234].
    
    Mentioned commit 04f9f068a619 ("regulator: s5m8767: Modify parsing
    method of the voltage table of buck2/3/4") broke it because DVS voltage
    won't be parsed from devicetree if DVS GPIO is not enabled.  After the
    change, driver will configure bucks to use the register reset value as
    voltage which might have unpleasant effects.
    
    Fix this by relaxing the bindings constrain: if DVS GPIO is not enabled
    in devicetree (therefore DVS voltage is also not parsed), explicitly
    disable it.

    commit 10adb1152d957a4d570ad630f93a88bb961616c1 upstream.
    
    At replay_dir_deletes(), if find_dir_range() returns an error we break out
    of the main while loop and then assign a value of 0 (success) to the 'ret'
    variable, resulting in completely ignoring that an error happened. Fix
    that by jumping to the 'out' label when find_dir_range() returns an error
    (negative value).

    xen/netfront: stop tx queues during live migration
    
    [ Upstream commit 042b2046d0f05cf8124c26ff65dbb6148a4404fb ]
    
    The tx queues are not stopped during the live migration. As a result, the
    ndo_start_xmit() may access netfront_info->queues which is freed by
    talk_to_netback()->xennet_destroy_queues().
    
    This patch is to netif_device_detach() at the beginning of xen-netfront
    resuming, and netif_device_attach() at the end of resuming.

    x86/irq: Ensure PI wakeup handler is unregistered before module unload
    
    commit 6ff53f6a438f72998f56e82e76694a1df9d1ea2c upstream.
    
    Add a synchronize_rcu() after clearing the posted interrupt wakeup handler
    to ensure all readers, i.e. in-flight IRQ handlers, see the new handler
    before returning to the caller.  If the caller is an exiting module and
    is unregistering its handler, failure to wait could result in the IRQ
    handler jumping into an unloaded module.
    
    The registration path doesn't require synchronization, as it's the
    caller's responsibility to not generate interrupts it cares about until
    after its handler is registered.

    ALSA: timer: Fix use-after-free problem
    
    commit c0317c0e87094f5b5782b6fdef5ae0a4b150496c upstream.
    
    When the timer instance was add into ack_list but was not currently in
    process, the user could stop it via snd_timer_stop1() without delete it
    from the ack_list. Then the user could free the timer instance and when
    it was actually processed UAF occurred.
    
    This issue could be reproduced via testcase snd_timer01 in ltp - running
    several instances of that testcase at the same time.
    
    What I actually met was that the ack_list of the timer broken and the
    kernel went into deadloop with irqoff. That could be detected by
    hardlockup detector on board or when we run it on qemu, we could use gdb
    to dump the ack_list when the console has no response.
    
    To fix this issue, we delete the timer instance from ack_list and

    ALSA: synth: missing check for possible NULL after the call to kstrdup
    
    commit d159037abbe3412285c271bdfb9cdf19e62678ff upstream.
    
    If kcalloc() return NULL due to memory starvation, it is possible for
    kstrdup() to return NULL in similar case. So add null check after the call
    to kstrdup() is made.

    Add the missing endpoint max-packet sanity check to probe() to avoid
    division by zero in alloc_stream_buffers() in case a malicious device
    has broken descriptors (or when doing descriptor fuzz testing).
    
    Note that USB core will reject URBs submitted for endpoints with zero

    need to handle this (cf. commit 2548288b4fb0 ("USB: Fix: Don't skip

    mmc: dw_mmc: Dont wait for DRTO on Write RSP error
    
    commit 43592c8736e84025d7a45e61a46c3fa40536a364 upstream.
    
    Only wait for DRTO on reads, otherwise the driver hangs.
    
    The driver prevents sending CMD12 on response errors like CRCs. According
    to the comment this is because some cards have problems with this during
    the UHS tuning sequence. Unfortunately this workaround currently also
    applies for any command with data. On reads this will set the drto timer,
    which then triggers after a while. On writes this will not set any timer
    and the tasklet will not be scheduled again.
    
    I cannot test for the UHS workarounds need, but even if so, it should at
    most apply to reads. I have observed many hangs when CMD25 response
    contained a CRC error. This patch fixes this without touching the actual
    UHS tuning workaround.

    ocfs2: fix data corruption on truncate
    
    commit 839b63860eb3835da165642923120d305925561d upstream.
    
    Patch series "ocfs2: Truncate data corruption fix".
    
    As further testing has shown, commit 5314454ea3f ("ocfs2: fix data
    corruption after conversion from inline format") didn't fix all the data
    corruption issues the customer started observing after 6dbf7bb55598
    ("fs: Don't invalidate page buffers in block_write_full_page()") This
    time I have tracked them down to two bugs in ocfs2 truncation code.
    
    One bug (truncating page cache before clearing tail cluster and setting
    i_size) could cause data corruption even before 6dbf7bb55598, but before
    that commit it needed a race with page fault, after 6dbf7bb55598 it
    started to be pretty deterministic.
    
    Another bug (zeroing pages beyond old i_size) used to be harmless
    inefficiency before commit 6dbf7bb55598.  But after commit 6dbf7bb55598
    in combination with the first bug it resulted in deterministic data
    corruption.
    
    Although fixing only the first problem is needed to stop data
    corruption, I've fixed both issues to make the code more robust.
    
    This patch (of 2):
    
    ocfs2_truncate_file() did unmap invalidate page cache pages before
    zeroing partial tail cluster and setting i_size.  Thus some pages could
    be left (and likely have left if the cluster zeroing happened) in the
    page cache beyond i_size after truncate finished letting user possibly
    see stale data once the file was extended again.  Also the tail cluster
    zeroing was not guaranteed to finish before truncate finished causing
    possible stale data exposure.  The problem started to be particularly
    easy to hit after commit 6dbf7bb55598 "fs: Don't invalidate page buffers
    in block_write_full_page()" stopped invalidation of pages beyond i_size
    from page writeback path.
    
    Fix these problems by unmapping and invalidating pages in the page cache
    after the i_size is reduced and tail cluster is zeroed out.

    libata: fix read log timeout value
    
    commit 68dbbe7d5b4fde736d104cbbc9a2fce875562012 upstream.
    
    Some ATA drives are very slow to respond to READ_LOG_EXT and
    READ_LOG_DMA_EXT commands issued from ata_dev_configure() when the
    device is revalidated right after resuming a system or inserting the
    ATA adapter driver (e.g. ahci). The default 5s timeout
    (ATA_EH_CMD_DFL_TIMEOUT) used for these commands is too short, causing
    errors during the device configuration. Ex:
    
    ...
    ata9: SATA max UDMA/133 abar m524288@0x9d200000 port 0x9d200400 irq 209
    ata9: SATA link up 6.0 Gbps (SStatus 133 SControl 300)
    ata9.00: ATA-9: XXX  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX, max UDMA/133
    ata9.00: qc timeout (cmd 0x2f)
    ata9.00: Read log page 0x00 failed, Emask 0x4
    ata9.00: Read log page 0x00 failed, Emask 0x40
    ata9.00: NCQ Send/Recv Log not supported
    ata9.00: Read log page 0x08 failed, Emask 0x40
    ata9.00: 27344764928 sectors, multi 16: LBA48 NCQ (depth 32), AA
    ata9.00: Read log page 0x00 failed, Emask 0x40
    ata9.00: ATA Identify Device Log not supported
    ata9.00: failed to set xfermode (err_mask=0x40)
    ata9: SATA link up 6.0 Gbps (SStatus 133 SControl 300)
    ata9.00: configured for UDMA/133
    ...
    
    The timeout error causes a soft reset of the drive link, followed in
    most cases by a successful revalidation as that give enough time to the
    drive to become fully ready to quickly process the read log commands.
    However, in some cases, this also fails resulting in the device being
    dropped.
    
    Fix this by using adding the ata_eh_revalidate_timeouts entries for the
    READ_LOG_EXT and READ_LOG_DMA_EXT commands. This defines a timeout
    increased to 15s, retriable one time.

    xhci: Fix USB 3.1 enumeration issues by increasing roothub power-on-good delay
    
    commit e1959faf085b004e6c3afaaaa743381f00e7c015 upstream.
    
    Some USB 3.1 enumeration issues were reported after the hub driver removed
    the minimum 100ms limit for the power-on-good delay.
    
    Since commit 90d28fb53d4a ("usb: core: reduce power-on-good delay time of
    root hub") the hub driver sets the power-on-delay based on the
    bPwrOn2PwrGood value in the hub descriptor.
    
    xhci driver has a 20ms bPwrOn2PwrGood value for both roothubs based
    on xhci spec section 5.4.8, but it's clearly not enough for the
    USB 3.1 devices, causing enumeration issues.
    
    Tests indicate full 100ms delay is needed.

    binder: use cred instead of task for selinux checks
    
    commit 52f88693378a58094c538662ba652aff0253c4fe upstream.
    
    Since binder was integrated with selinux, it has passed
    'struct task_struct' associated with the binder_proc
    to represent the source and target of transactions.
    The conversion of task to SID was then done in the hook
    implementations. It turns out that there are race conditions
    which can result in an incorrect security context being used.
    
    Fix by using the 'struct cred' saved during binder_open and pass
    it to the selinux subsystem.
