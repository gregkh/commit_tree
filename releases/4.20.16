    perf/x86/intel: Implement support for TSX Force Abort
    
    commit 400816f60c543153656ac74eaf7f36f6b7202378 upstream
    
    Skylake (and later) will receive a microcode update to address a TSX
    errata. This microcode will, on execution of a TSX instruction
    (speculative or not) use (clobber) PMC3. This update will also provide
    a new MSR to change this behaviour along with a CPUID bit to enumerate
    the presence of this new MSR.
    
    When the MSR gets set; the microcode will no longer use PMC3 but will
    Force Abort every TSX transaction (upon executing COMMIT).
    
    When TSX Force Abort (TFA) is allowed (default); the MSR gets set when
    PMC3 gets scheduled and cleared when, after scheduling, PMC3 is
    unused.
    
    When TFA is not allowed; clear PMC3 from all constraints such that it
    will not get used.

    x86: Add TSX Force Abort CPUID/MSR
    
    commit 52f64909409c17adf54fcf5f9751e0544ca3a6b4 upstream
    
    Skylake systems will receive a microcode update to address a TSX
    errata. This microcode will (by default) clobber PMC3 when TSX
    instructions are (speculatively or not) executed.
    
    It also provides an MSR to cause all TSX transaction to abort and
    preserve PMC3.
    
    Add the CPUID enumeration and MSR definition.

    ath9k: Avoid OF no-EEPROM quirks without qca,no-eeprom
    
    commit ce938231bd3b1d7af3cbd8836f084801090470e1 upstream.
    
    ath9k_of_init() function[0] was initially written on the assumption that
    if someone had an explicit ath9k OF node that "there must be something
    wrong, why would someone add an OF node if everything is fine"[1]
    (Quoting Martin Blumenstingl <martin.blumenstingl@googlemail.com>)
    
    "it turns out it's not that simple. with your requirements I'm now aware
    of two use-cases where the current code in ath9k_of_init() doesn't work
    without modifications"[1]
    
    The "your requirements" Martin speaks of is the result of the fact that I
    have a device (PowerCloud Systems CR5000) has some kind of default - not
    unique mac address - set and requires to set the correct MAC address via
    mac-address devicetree property, however:
    
    "some cards come with a physical EEPROM chip [or OTP] so "qca,no-eeprom"
    should not be set (your use-case). in this case AH_USE_EEPROM should be
    set (which is the default when there is no OF node)"[1]
    
    The other use case is:
    
    the firmware on some PowerMac G5 seems to add a OF node for the ath9k
    card automatically. depending on the EEPROM on the card AH_NO_EEP_SWAP
    should be unset (which is the default when there is no OF node). see [3]
    
    After this patch to ath9k_of_init() the new behavior will be:
    
        if there's no OF node then everything is the same as before
        if there's an empty OF node then ath9k will use the hardware EEPROM
          (before ath9k would fail to initialize because no EEPROM data was
          provided by userspace)
        if there's an OF node with only a MAC address then ath9k will use
          the MAC address and the hardware EEPROM (see the case above)
        with "qca,no-eeprom" EEPROM data from userspace will be requested.
          the behavior here will not change
    [1]
    
    Martin provides additional background on EEPROM swapping[1].
    
    Thanks to Christian Lamparter <chunkeey@gmail.com> for all his help on
    troubleshooting this issue and the basis for this patch.

    gfs2: Fix missed wakeups in find_insert_glock
    
    commit 605b0487f0bc1ae9963bf52ece0f5c8055186f81 upstream.
    
    Mark Syms has reported seeing tasks that are stuck waiting in
    find_insert_glock.  It turns out that struct lm_lockname contains four padding
    bytes on 64-bit architectures that function glock_waitqueue doesn't skip when
    hashing the glock name.  As a result, we can end up waking up the wrong
    waitqueue, and the waiting tasks may be stuck forever.
    
    Fix that by using ht_parms.key_len instead of sizeof(struct lm_lockname) for
    the key length.

    bpf: Stop the psock parser before canceling its work
    
    commit e8e3437762ad938880dd48a3c52d702e7cf3c124 upstream.
    
    We might have never enabled (started) the psock's parser, in which case it
    will not get stopped when destroying the psock. This leads to a warning
    when trying to cancel parser's work from psock's deferred destructor:

    by calling strp_done so that it cancels its work. Otherwise the worker
    thread can run after we have freed the parser, and attempt to access
    its workqueue resulting in a use-after-free:

    commit c528f7bd362b097eeeafa6fbbeccd9750b79c7ba upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 0e157e52860441cb26051f131dd0b5ae3187a07b.
    
    Heiner reported that the commit in question prevents his network adapter
    from triggering PME and waking up when network cable is plugged.
    
    The commit tried to prevent root port waking up from D3cold immediately but
    looks like disabing root port PME interrupt is not the right way to fix
    that issue so revert it now.  The patch following proposes an alternative
    solution to that issue.

    media: Revert "media: rc: some events are dropped by userspace"
    
    commit 05f0edadcc5fccdfc0676825b3e70e75dc0a8a84 upstream.
    
    When an rc device is created, we do not know what key codes it will
    support, since a new keymap might be loaded at some later point. So,
    we set all keybit in the input device.
    
    The uevent for the input device includes all the key codes, of which
    there are now 768. This overflows the size of the uevent
    (UEVENT_BUFFER_SIZE) and no event is generated.
    
    Revert for now until we figure out a different solution.
    
    This reverts commit fec225a04330d0f222d24feb5bea045526031675.

    drm: disable uncached DMA optimization for ARM and arm64
    
    [ Upstream commit e02f5c1bb2283cfcee68f2f0feddcc06150f13aa ]
    
    The DRM driver stack is designed to work with cache coherent devices
    only, but permits an optimization to be enabled in some cases, where
    for some buffers, both the CPU and the GPU use uncached mappings,
    removing the need for DMA snooping and allocation in the CPU caches.
    
    The use of uncached GPU mappings relies on the correct implementation
    of the PCIe NoSnoop TLP attribute by the platform, otherwise the GPU
    will use cached mappings nonetheless. On x86 platforms, this does not
    seem to matter, as uncached CPU mappings will snoop the caches in any
    case. However, on ARM and arm64, enabling this optimization on a
    platform where NoSnoop is ignored results in loss of coherency, which
    breaks correct operation of the device. Since we have no way of
    detecting whether NoSnoop works or not, just disable this
    optimization entirely for ARM and arm64.

    ARM: dts: exynos: Fix max voltage for buck8 regulator on Odroid XU3/XU4
    
    commit a3238924a820c1d7c977b632b769f3b5690cba09 upstream.
    
    The maximum voltage value for buck8 regulator on Odroid XU3/XU4 boards is
    set too low. Increase it to the 2000mV as specified on the board schematic.
    So far the board worked fine, because of the bug in the PMIC driver, which
    used incorrect step value for that regulator. It interpreted the voltage
    value set by the bootloader as 1225mV and kept it unchanged. The regulator
    driver has been however fixed recently in the commit 56b5d4ea778c
    ("regulator: s2mps11: Fix steps for buck7, buck8 and LDO35"), what results
    in reading the proper buck8 value and forcing it to 1500mV on boot. This
    is not enough for proper board operation and results in eMMC errors during
    heavy IO traffic. Increasing maximum voltage value for buck8 restores
    original driver behavior and fixes eMMC issues.

    ARM: dts: exynos: Fix pinctrl definition for eMMC RTSN line on Odroid X2/U3
    
    commit ec33745bccc8f336957c751f4153421cc9ef5a54 upstream.
    
    Commit 225da7e65a03 ("ARM: dts: add eMMC reset line for
    exynos4412-odroid-common") added MMC power sequence for eMMC card of
    Odroid X2/U3. It reused generic sd1_cd pin control configuration node
    and only disabled pull-up. However that time the pinctrl configuration
    was not applied during MMC power sequence driver initialization. This
    has been changed later by commit d97a1e5d7cd2 ("mmc: pwrseq: convert to
    proper platform device").
    
    It turned out then, that the provided pinctrl configuration is not
    correct, because the eMMC_RTSN line is being re-configured as 'special
    function/card detect function for mmc1 controller' not the simple
    'output', thus the power sequence driver doesn't really set the pin
    value. This in effect broke the reboot of Odroid X2/U3 boards. Fix this
    by providing separate node with eMMC_RTSN pin configuration.

    commit 83b944174ad79825ae84a47af1a0354485b24602 upstream.
    
    Somewhere along recent changes to power control of the wl1835, power-on
    became very unreliable on the hikey, failing like this:

    wl1271_sdio: probe of mmc2:0001:2 failed with error -16
    
    After playing with some dt parameters and comparing to other users of
    this chip, it turned out we need some power-on delay to make things
    stable again. In contrast to those other users which define 200 ms, the
    hikey would already be happy with 1 ms. Still, we use the safer 10 ms,
    like on the Ultra96.

    x86/PCI: Fixup RTIT_BAR of Intel Denverton Trace Hub
    
    commit 2e095ce7b6ecce2f3e2ff330527f12056ed1e1a1 upstream.
    
    On Denverton's integration of the Intel(R) Trace Hub (for a reference and
    overview see Documentation/trace/intel_th.rst) the reported size of one of
    its resources (RTIT_BAR) doesn't match its actual size, which leads to
    overlaps with other devices' resources.
    
    In practice, it overlaps with XHCI MMIO space, which results in the xhci
    driver bailing out after seeing its registers as 0xffffffff, and perceived
    disappearance of all USB devices:
    
      intel_th_pci 0000:00:1f.7: enabling device (0004 -> 0006)
      xhci_hcd 0000:00:15.0: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
      xhci_hcd 0000:00:15.0: xHC not responding in xhci_irq, assume controller is dead
      xhci_hcd 0000:00:15.0: HC died; cleaning up
      usb 1-1: USB disconnect, device number 2
    
    For this reason, we need to resize the RTIT_BAR on Denverton to its actual
    size, which in this case is 4MB.  The corresponding erratum is DNV36 at the
    link below:
    
      DNV36.       Processor Host Root Complex May Incorrectly Route Memory
                   Accesses to Intel® Trace Hub
    
      Problem:     The Intel® Trace Hub RTIT_BAR (B0:D31:F7 offset 20h) is
                   reported as a 2KB memory range.  Due to this erratum, the
                   processor Host Root Complex will forward addresses from
                   RTIT_BAR to RTIT_BAR + 4MB -1 to Intel® Trace Hub.
    
      Implication: Devices assigned within the RTIT_BAR to RTIT_BAR + 4MB -1
                   space may not function correctly.
    
      Workaround:  A BIOS code change has been identified and may be
                   implemented as a workaround for this erratum.
    
      Status:      No Fix.
    
    Note that 5118ccd34780 ("intel_th: pci: Add Denverton SOC support") updates
    the Trace Hub driver so it claims the Denverton device, but the resource
    overlap exists regardless of whether that driver is loaded or that commit
    is included.

    netfilter: nft_compat: don't use refcount_inc on newly allocated entry
    
    [ Upstream commit 947e492c0fc2132ae5fca081a9c2952ccaab0404 ]
    
    When I moved the refcount to refcount_t type I missed the fact that
    refcount_inc() will result in use-after-free warning with
    CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL=y builds.
    
    The correct fix would be to init the reference count to 1 at allocation
    time, but, unfortunately we cannot do this, as we can't undo that
    in case something else fails later in the batch.
    
    So only solution I see is to special-case the 'new entry' condition
    and replace refcount_inc() with a "delayed" refcount_set(1) in this case,
    as done here.
    
    The .activate callback can be removed to simplify things, we only
    need to make sure that deactivate() decrements/unlinks the entry
    from the list at end of transaction phase (commit or abort).

    netfilter: nf_tables: unbind set in rule from commit path
    
    [ Upstream commit f6ac8585897684374a19863fff21186a05805286 ]
    
    Anonymous sets that are bound to rules from the same transaction trigger
    a kernel splat from the abort path due to double set list removal and
    double free.
    
    This patch updates the logic to search for the transaction that is
    responsible for creating the set and disable the set list removal and
    release, given the rule is now responsible for this. Lookup is reverse
    since the transaction that adds the set is likely to be at the tail of
    the list.
    
    Moreover, this patch adds the unbind step to deliver the event from the
    commit path.  This should not be done from the worker thread, since we

    The ->inflight counter may be negative (-1) if
    
    1) blk-iolatency was disabled when the IO was issued,
    
    2) blk-iolatency was enabled before this IO reached its endio,
    
    3) the ->inflight counter is decreased from 0 to -1 in endio()
    
    In fact the hang can be easily reproduced by the below script,
    
    H=/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/
    P=/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/test
    
    echo "+io" > $H/cgroup.subtree_control
    mkdir -p $P
    
    echo $$ > $P/cgroup.procs
    
    xfs_io -f -d -c "pwrite 0 4k" /dev/sdg
    
    echo "`cat /sys/block/sdg/dev` target=1000000" > $P/io.latency
    
    xfs_io -f -d -c "pwrite 0 4k" /dev/sdg
    
    This fixes the problem by freezing the queue so that while
    enabling/disabling iolatency, there is no inflight rq running.
    
    Note that quiesce_queue is not needed as this only updating iolatency
    configuration about which dispatching request_queue doesn't care.

    nvme-pci: fix rapid add remove sequence
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c959d73dba6495ec01d04c206ee679d61ccb2b0 ]
    
    A surprise removal may fail to tear down request queues if it is racing
    with the initial asynchronous probe. If that happens, the remove path
    won't see the queue resources to tear down, and the controller reset
    path may create a new request queue on a removed device, but will not
    be able to make forward progress, deadlocking the pci removal.
    
    Protect setting up non-blocking resources from a shutdown by holding the
    same mutex, and transition to the CONNECTING state after these resources
    are initialized so the probe path may see the dead controller state
    before dispatching new IO.

    nvme: lock NS list changes while handling command effects
    
    [ Upstream commit e7ad43c3eda6a1690c4c3c341f95dc1c6898da83 ]
    
    If a controller supports the NS Change Notification, the namespace
    scan_work is automatically triggered after attaching a new namespace.
    
    Occasionally the namespace scan_work may append the new namespace to the
    list before the admin command effects handling is completed. The effects
    handling unfreezes namespaces, but if it unfreezes the newly attached
    namespace, its request_queue freeze depth will be off and we'll hit the
    warning in blk_mq_unfreeze_queue().
    
    On the next namespace add, we will fail to freeze that queue due to the
    previous bad accounting and deadlock waiting for frozen.
    
    Fix that by preventing scan work from altering the namespace list while
    command effects handling needs to pair freeze with unfreeze.

    drm/omap: dsi: Hack-fix DSI bus flags
    
    [ Upstream commit 6297388e1eddd2f1345cea5892156223995bcf2d ]
    
    Since commit b4935e3a3cfa ("drm/omap: Store bus flags in the
    omap_dss_device structure") video mode flags are managed by the omapdss
    (and later omapdrm) core based on bus flags stored in omap_dss_device.
    This works fine for all devices whose video modes are set by the omapdss
    and omapdrm core, but breaks DSI operation as the DSI still uses legacy
    code paths and sets the DISPC timings manually.
    
    To fix the problem properly we should move the DSI encoder to the new
    encoder model. This will however require a considerable amount of work.
    Restore DSI operation by adding back video mode flags handling in the
    DSI encoder driver as a hack in the meantime.

    And at least am437x based devices with pixcir_ts will fail to resume
    to a touchscreen that is configured as the wakeup-source in device
    tree for these devices.
    
    This is because pixcir_ts tries to reconfigure it's registers for
    noirq suspend which fails. This also leaves i2c-omap in enabled state
    for suspend.
    
    Let's fix the pixcir_ts issue and make sure i2c-omap is suspended by
    adding SET_NOIRQ_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS.
    
    Let's also get rid of some ifdefs while at it and replace them with
    __maybe_unused as SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS and SET_NOIRQ_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS
    already deal with the various PM Kconfig options.

    1) If the rport is never linked into the peer list it will not be

    2) If the rport is deleted from the peer list using list_del_rcu(), then
    the list_head is in an undefined state and it is not considered empty.

    MIPS: Remove function size check in get_frame_info()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b424cfc69728224fcb5fad138ea7260728e0901 ]
    
    Patch (b6c7a324df37b "MIPS: Fix get_frame_info() handling of
    microMIPS function size.") introduces additional function size
    check for microMIPS by only checking insn between ip and ip + func_size.
    However, func_size in get_frame_info() is always 0 if KALLSYMS is not
    enabled. This causes get_frame_info() to return immediately without
    calculating correct frame_size, which in turn causes "Can't analyze
    schedule() prologue" warning messages at boot time.
    
    This patch removes func_size check, and let the frame_size check run
    up to 128 insns for both MIPS and microMIPS.

    perf trace: Support multiple "vfs_getname" probes
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ab3bc240ade47a0f52bc16d97edd9accbe0024e ]
    
    With a suitably defined "probe:vfs_getname" probe, 'perf trace' can
    "beautify" its output, so syscalls like open() or openat() can print the
    "filename" argument instead of just its hex address, like:
    
      $ perf trace -e open -- touch /dev/null
      [...]
           0.590 ( 0.014 ms): touch/18063 open(filename: /dev/null, flags: CREAT|NOCTTY|NONBLOCK|WRONLY, mode: IRUGO|IWUGO) = 3
      [...]
    
    The output without such beautifier looks like:
    
         0.529 ( 0.011 ms): touch/18075 open(filename: 0xc78cf288, flags: CREAT|NOCTTY|NONBLOCK|WRONLY, mode: IRUGO|IWUGO) = 3
    
    However, when the vfs_getname probe expands to multiple probes and it is
    not the first one that is hit, the beautifier fails, as following:
    
         0.326 ( 0.010 ms): touch/18072 open(filename: , flags: CREAT|NOCTTY|NONBLOCK|WRONLY, mode: IRUGO|IWUGO) = 3
    
    Fix it by hooking into all the expanded probes (inlines), now, for instance:
    
      [root@quaco ~]# perf probe -l
        probe:vfs_getname    (on getname_flags:73@fs/namei.c with pathname)
        probe:vfs_getname_1  (on getname_flags:73@fs/namei.c with pathname)
      [root@quaco ~]# perf trace -e open* sleep 1
           0.010 ( 0.005 ms): sleep/5588 openat(dfd: CWD, filename: /etc/ld.so.cache, flags: RDONLY|CLOEXEC)   = 3
           0.029 ( 0.006 ms): sleep/5588 openat(dfd: CWD, filename: /lib64/libc.so.6, flags: RDONLY|CLOEXEC)   = 3
           0.194 ( 0.008 ms): sleep/5588 openat(dfd: CWD, filename: /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive, flags: RDONLY|CLOEXEC) = 3
      [root@quaco ~]#
    
    Works, further verified with:
    
      [root@quaco ~]# perf test vfs
      65: Use vfs_getname probe to get syscall args filenames   : Ok
      66: Add vfs_getname probe to get syscall args filenames   : Ok
      67: Check open filename arg using perf trace + vfs_getname: Ok

    perf symbols: Filter out hidden symbols from labels
    
    [ Upstream commit 59a17706915fe5ea6f711e1f92d4fb706bce07fe ]
    
    When perf is built with the annobin plugin (RHEL8 build) extra symbols
    are added to its binary:
    
      # nm perf | grep annobin | head -10
      0000000000241100 t .annobin_annotate.c
      0000000000326490 t .annobin_annotate.c
      0000000000249255 t .annobin_annotate.c_end
      00000000003283a8 t .annobin_annotate.c_end
      00000000001bce18 t .annobin_annotate.c_end.hot
      00000000001bce18 t .annobin_annotate.c_end.hot
      00000000001bc3e2 t .annobin_annotate.c_end.unlikely
      00000000001bc400 t .annobin_annotate.c_end.unlikely
      00000000001bce18 t .annobin_annotate.c.hot
      00000000001bce18 t .annobin_annotate.c.hot
      ...
    
    Those symbols have no use for report or annotation and should be
    skipped.  Moreover they interfere with the DWARF unwind test on the PPC
    arch, where they are mixed with checked symbols and then the test fails:
    
      # perf test dwarf -v
      59: Test dwarf unwind                                     :
      --- start ---
      test child forked, pid 8515
      unwind: .annobin_dwarf_unwind.c:ip = 0x10dba40dc (0x2740dc)
      ...
      got: .annobin_dwarf_unwind.c 0x10dba40dc, expecting test__arch_unwind_sample
      unwind: failed with 'no error'
    
    The annobin symbols are defined as NOTYPE/LOCAL/HIDDEN:
    
      # readelf -s ./perf | grep annobin | head -1
        40: 00000000001bce4f     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  HIDDEN    13 .annobin_init.c
    
    They can still pass the check for the label symbol. Adding check for
    HIDDEN and INTERNAL (as suggested by Nick below) visibility and filter
    out such symbols.
    
    >   Just to be awkward, if you are going to ignore STV_HIDDEN
    >   symbols then you should probably also ignore STV_INTERNAL ones
    >   as well...  Annobin does not generate them, but you never know,
    >   one day some other tool might create some.

    s390/qeth: conclude all event processing before offlining a card
    
    [ Upstream commit c0a2e4d10d9366ada133a8ae4ff2f32397f8b15b ]
    
    Work for Bridgeport events is currently placed on a driver-wide
    workqueue. If the card is removed and freed while any such work is still
    active, this causes a use-after-free.
    So put the events on a per-card queue, where we can control their
    lifetime. As we also don't want stale events to last beyond an
    offline & online cycle, flush this queue when setting the card offline.

    netfilter: nf_nat: skip nat clash resolution for same-origin entries
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e35c1cb9460240e983a01745b5f29fe3a4d8e39 ]
    
    It is possible that two concurrent packets originating from the same
    socket of a connection-less protocol (e.g. UDP) can end up having
    different IP_CT_DIR_REPLY tuples which results in one of the packets
    being dropped.
    
    To illustrate this, consider the following simplified scenario:
    
    1. Packet A and B are sent at the same time from two different threads
       by same UDP socket.  No matching conntrack entry exists yet.
       Both packets cause allocation of a new conntrack entry.
    2. get_unique_tuple gets called for A.  No clashing entry found.
       conntrack entry for A is added to main conntrack table.
    3. get_unique_tuple is called for B and will find that the reply
       tuple of B is already taken by A.
       It will allocate a new UDP source port for B to resolve the clash.
    4. conntrack entry for B cannot be added to main conntrack table
       because its ORIGINAL direction is clashing with A and the REPLY
       directions of A and B are not the same anymore due to UDP source
       port reallocation done in step 3.
    
    This patch modifies nf_conntrack_tuple_taken so it doesn't consider
    colliding reply tuples if the IP_CT_DIR_ORIGINAL tuples are equal.

    dmaengine: at_xdmac: Fix wrongfull report of a channel as in use
    
    [ Upstream commit dc3f595b6617ebc0307e0ce151e8f2f2b2489b95 ]
    
    atchan->status variable is used to store two different information:
     - pass channel interrupts status from interrupt handler to tasklet;
     - channel information like whether it is cyclic or paused;
    
    This causes a bug when device_terminate_all() is called,
    (AT_XDMAC_CHAN_IS_CYCLIC cleared on atchan->status) and then a late End
    of Block interrupt arrives (AT_XDMAC_CIS_BIS), which sets bit 0 of
    atchan->status. Bit 0 is also used for AT_XDMAC_CHAN_IS_CYCLIC, so when
    a new descriptor for a cyclic transfer is created, the driver reports
    the channel as in use:
    
    if (test_and_set_bit(AT_XDMAC_CHAN_IS_CYCLIC, &atchan->status)) {
            dev_err(chan2dev(chan), "channel currently used\n");
            return NULL;
    }
    
    This patch fixes the bug by adding a different struct member to keep
    the interrupts status separated from the channel status bits.

    drm/sun4i: tcon: Prepare and enable TCON channel 0 clock at init
    
    [ Upstream commit b14e945bda8ae227d1bf2b1837c0c4a61721cd1a ]
    
    When initializing clocks, a reference to the TCON channel 0 clock is
    obtained. However, the clock is never prepared and enabled later.
    Switching from simplefb to DRM actually disables the clock (that was
    usually configured by U-Boot) because of that.
    
    On the V3s, this results in a hang when writing to some mixer registers
    when switching over to DRM from simplefb.
    
    Fix this by preparing and enabling the clock when initializing other
    clocks. Waiting for sun4i_tcon_channel_enable to enable the clock is
    apparently too late and results in the same mixer register access hang.

    bpf: Fix syscall's stackmap lookup potential deadlock
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c4cd051add3d00bbff008a133c936c515eaa8fe ]
    
    The map_lookup_elem used to not acquiring spinlock
    in order to optimize the reader.
    
    It was true until commit 557c0c6e7df8 ("bpf: convert stackmap to pre-allocation")
    The syscall's map_lookup_elem(stackmap) calls bpf_stackmap_copy().
    bpf_stackmap_copy() may find the elem no longer needed after the copy is done.
    If that is the case, pcpu_freelist_push() saves this elem for reuse later.
    This push requires a spinlock.
    
    If a tracing bpf_prog got run in the middle of the syscall's
    map_lookup_elem(stackmap) and this tracing bpf_prog is calling
    bpf_get_stackid(stackmap) which also requires the same pcpu_freelist's
    spinlock, it may end up with a dead lock situation as reported by
    Eric Dumazet in https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1030266/
    
    The situation is the same as the syscall's map_update_elem() which
    needs to acquire the pcpu_freelist's spinlock and could race
    with tracing bpf_prog.  Hence, this patch fixes it by protecting
    bpf_stackmap_copy() with this_cpu_inc(bpf_prog_active)
    to prevent tracing bpf_prog from running.
    
    A later syscall's map_lookup_elem commit f1a2e44a3aec ("bpf: add queue and stack maps")
    also acquires a spinlock and races with tracing bpf_prog similarly.
    Hence, this patch is forward looking and protects the majority
    of the map lookups.  bpf_map_offload_lookup_elem() is the exception
    since it is for network bpf_prog only (i.e. never called by tracing
    bpf_prog).

    It has been explained that is a false positive here:
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/7/25/756
    Recap:
    - stackmap uses pcpu_freelist
    - The lock in pcpu_freelist is a percpu lock
    - stackmap is only used by tracing bpf_prog
    - A tracing bpf_prog cannot be run if another bpf_prog
      has already been running (ensured by the percpu bpf_prog_active counter).
    
    Eric pointed out that this lockdep splats stops other
    legit lockdep splats in selftests/bpf/test_progs.c.
    
    Fix this by calling local_irq_save/restore for stackmap.
    
    Another false positive had also been worked around by calling
    local_irq_save in commit 89ad2fa3f043 ("bpf: fix lockdep splat").
    That commit added unnecessary irq_save/restore to fast path of
    bpf hash map. irqs are already disabled at that point, since htab
    is holding per bucket spin_lock with irqsave.
    
    Let's reduce overhead for htab by introducing __pcpu_freelist_push/pop
    function w/o irqsave and convert pcpu_freelist_push/pop to irqsave
    to be used elsewhere (right now only in stackmap).
    It stops lockdep false positive in stackmap with a bit of acceptable overhead.

    bpf: run bpf programs with preemption disabled
    
    [ Upstream commit 6cab5e90ab2bd323c9f3811b6c70a4687df51e27 ]
    
    Disabled preemption is necessary for proper access to per-cpu maps
    from BPF programs.
    
    But the sender side of socket filters didn't have preemption disabled:
    unix_dgram_sendmsg->sk_filter->sk_filter_trim_cap->bpf_prog_run_save_cb->BPF_PROG_RUN
    
    and a combination of af_packet with tun device didn't disable either:
    tpacket_snd->packet_direct_xmit->packet_pick_tx_queue->ndo_select_queue->
      tun_select_queue->tun_ebpf_select_queue->bpf_prog_run_clear_cb->BPF_PROG_RUN
    
    Disable preemption before executing BPF programs (both classic and extended).

    bpf, selftests: fix handling of sparse CPU allocations
    
    [ Upstream commit 1bb54c4071f585ebef56ce8fdfe6026fa2cbcddd ]
    
    Previously, bpf_num_possible_cpus() had a bug when calculating a
    number of possible CPUs in the case of sparse CPU allocations, as
    it was considering only the first range or element of
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/possible.
    
    E.g. in the case of "0,2-3" (CPU 1 is not available), the function
    returned 1 instead of 3.
    
    This patch fixes the function by making it parse all CPU ranges and
    elements.

    This problem was exposed when debugfs started to return errors instead

    Also, the check for WARN_ON(dentry) was just wrong :)

    drm/amdgpu: Transfer fences to dmabuf importer
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e11ea9de9576a644045ffdc2067c09bc2012eda ]
    
    amdgpu only uses shared-fences internally, but dmabuf importers rely on
    implicit write hazard tracking via the reservation_object.fence_excl.
    For example, the importer use the write hazard for timing a page flip to
    only occur after the exporter has finished flushing its write into the
    surface. As such, on exporting a dmabuf, we must either flush all
    outstanding fences (for we do not know which are writes and should have
    been exclusive) or alternatively create a new exclusive fence that is
    the composite of all the existing shared fences, and so will only be
    signaled when all earlier fences are signaled (ensuring that we can not
    be signaled before the completion of any earlier write).
    
    v2: reservation_object is already locked by amdgpu_bo_reserve()
    v3: Replace looping with get_fences_rcu and special case the promotion
    of a single shared fence directly to an exclusive fence, bypassing the
    fence array.
    v4: Drop the fence array ref after assigning to reservation_object

    Check if the device is root rather before attempting to see what
    speeds the pcie port supports.  Fixes a crash with pci passthrough
    in a VM.

    irqchip/mmp: Only touch the PJ4 IRQ & FIQ bits on enable/disable
    
    [ Upstream commit 2380a22b60ce6f995eac806e69c66e397b59d045 ]
    
    Resetting bit 4 disables the interrupt delivery to the "secure
    processor" core. This breaks the keyboard on a OLPC XO 1.75 laptop,
    where the firmware running on the "secure processor" bit-bangs the
    PS/2 protocol over the GPIO lines.
    
    It is not clear what the rest of the bits are and Marvell was unhelpful
    when asked for documentation. Aside from the SP bit, there are probably
    priority bits.
    
    Leaving the unknown bits as the firmware set them up seems to be a wiser
    course of action compared to just turning them off.

    irqchip/gic-v4: Fix occasional VLPI drop
    
    [ Upstream commit 6479450f72c1391c03f08affe0d0110f41ae7ca0 ]
    
    1. In current implementation, every VLPI will temporarily be mapped to
    the first CPU in system (normally CPU0) and then moved to the real
    scheduled CPU later.
    
    2. So there is a time window and a VLPI may be sent to CPU0 instead of
    the real scheduled vCPU, in a multi-CPU virtual machine.
    
    3. However, CPU0 may have not been scheduled as a virtual CPU after
    system boots up, so the value of its GICR_VPROPBASER is unknown at
    that moment.
    
    4. If the INTID of VLPI is larger than 2^(GICR_VPROPBASER.IDbits+1),
    while IDbits is also in unknown state, GIC will behave as if the VLPI
    is out of range and simply drop it, which results in interrupt missing
    in Guest.
    
    As no code will clear GICR_VPROPBASER at runtime, we can safely
    initialize the IDbits field at boot time for each CPU to get rid of
    this issue.
    
    We also clear Valid bit of GICR_VPENDBASER in case any ancient
    programming gets left in and causes memory corrupting. A new function
    its_clear_vpend_valid() is added to reuse the code in
    its_vpe_deschedule().

    batman-adv: release station info tidstats
    
    [ Upstream commit 7d652669b61d702c6e62a39579d17f6881670ab6 ]
    
    With the addition of TXQ stats in the per-tid statistics the struct
    station_info grew significantly. This resulted in stack size warnings
    due to the structure itself being above the limit for the warnings.
    
    To work around this, the TID array was allocated dynamically. Also a
    function to free this content was introduced with commit 7ea3e110f2f8
    ("cfg80211: release station info tidstats where needed") but the necessary
    changes were not provided for batman-adv's B.A.T.M.A.N. V implementation.

      Error: can't get prog info (29): Bad address
    
    The problem is in the prog_fd_by_tag function not cleaning
    the struct bpf_prog_info before another request, so the
    previous program length is still in there and kernel assumes
    it needs to dump the program, which fails because there's no
    user pointer set.
    
    Moving the struct bpf_prog_info declaration into the loop,
    so it gets cleaned before each query.

    wlcore: sdio: Fixup power on/off sequence
    
    [ Upstream commit 13e62626c578d9889ebbda7c521be5adff9bef8e ]
    
    During "wlan-up", we are programming the FW into the WiFi-chip. However,
    re-programming the FW doesn't work, unless a power cycle of the WiFi-chip
    is made in-between the programmings.
    
    To conform to this requirement and to fix the regression in a simple way,
    let's start by allowing that the SDIO card (WiFi-chip) may stay powered on
    (runtime resumed) when wl12xx_sdio_power_off() returns. The intent with the
    current code is to treat this scenario as an error, but unfortunate this
    doesn't work as expected, so let's fix this.
    
    The other part is to guarantee that a power cycle of the SDIO card has been
    completed when wl12xx_sdio_power_on() returns, as to allow the FW
    programming to succeed. However, relying solely on runtime PM to deal with
    this isn't sufficient. For example, userspace may prevent runtime suspend
    via sysfs for the device that represents the SDIO card, leading to that the
    mmc core also keeps it powered on. For this reason, let's instead do a
    brute force power cycle in wl12xx_sdio_power_on().

    It wasn't possible for one_regmap_config to be non-NULL at the point

    Applied the same pattern of allocating one_regmap_config using

    I have looked at the other callers of siginmask and they all appear to
    in locations where sig can not be zero.
    
    I have looked at the code generation of adding an extra test against
    zero and gcc was able with a simple decrement instruction to combine
    the two tests together. So the at most adding this test cost a single
    cpu cycle.  In practice that decrement instruction was already present
    as part of the mask comparison, so the only change was when the
    instruction was executed.
    
    So given that it is cheap, and obviously correct to update siginmask
    to verify the signal is not zero.  Fix this issue there to avoid any
    future problems.

    arm: dts: meson: Fix IRQ trigger type for macirq
    
    [ Upstream commit e35e26b26e955c53e61c154ba26b9bb15da6b858 ]
    
    A long running stress test on a custom board shipping an AXG SoCs and a
    Realtek RTL8211F PHY revealed that after a few hours the connection
    speed would drop drastically, from ~1000Mbps to ~3Mbps. At the same time
    the 'macirq' (eth0) IRQ would stop being triggered at all and as
    consequence the GMAC IRQs never ACKed.
    
    After a painful investigation the problem seemed to be due to a wrong
    defined IRQ type for the GMAC IRQ that should be LEVEL_HIGH instead of
    EDGE_RISING.
    
    The change in the macirq IRQ type also solved another long standing
    issue affecting this SoC/PHY where EEE was causing the network
    connection to die after stressing it with iperf3 (even though much
    sooner). It's now possible to remove the 'eee-broken-1000t' quirk as
    well.

    and bisected it down to commit efad4e475c31 ("mm, memory_hotplug:
    is_mem_section_removable do not pass the end of a zone").
    
    The reason for the crash is that the mapping is garbage for poisoned
    (uninitialized) page.  This shouldn't happen as all pages in the zone's
    boundary should be initialized.
    
    Later debugging revealed that the actual problem is an off-by-one when
    evaluating the end_page.  'start_pfn + nr_pages' resp 'zone_end_pfn'
    refers to a pfn after the range and as such it might belong to a
    differen memory section.
    
    This along with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM then makes the loop condition
    completely bogus because a pointer arithmetic doesn't work for pages
    from two different sections in that memory model.
    
    Fix the issue by reworking is_pageblock_removable to be pfn based and
    only use struct page where necessary.  This makes the code slightly
    easier to follow and we will remove the problematic pointer arithmetic
    completely.

    autofs: drop dentry reference only when it is never used
    
    [ Upstream commit 63ce5f552beb9bdb41546b3a26c4374758b21815 ]
    
    autofs_expire_run() calls dput(dentry) to drop the reference count of
    dentry.  However, dentry is read via autofs_dentry_ino(dentry) after
    that.  This may result in a use-free-bug.  The patch drops the reference
    count of dentry only when it is never used.

    fs/drop_caches.c: avoid softlockups in drop_pagecache_sb()
    
    [ Upstream commit c27d82f52f75fc9d8d9d40d120d2a96fdeeada5e ]
    
    When superblock has lots of inodes without any pagecache (like is the
    case for /proc), drop_pagecache_sb() will iterate through all of them
    without dropping sb->s_inode_list_lock which can lead to softlockups
    (one of our customers hit this).
    
    Fix the problem by going to the slow path and doing cond_resched() in
    case the process needs rescheduling.

    psi: fix aggregation idle shut-off
    
    [ Upstream commit 1b69ac6b40ebd85eed73e4dbccde2a36961ab990 ]
    
    psi has provisions to shut off the periodic aggregation worker when
    there is a period of no task activity - and thus no data that needs
    aggregating.  However, while developing psi monitoring, Suren noticed
    that the aggregation clock currently won't stay shut off for good.
    
    Debugging this revealed a flaw in the idle design: an aggregation run
    will see no task activity and decide to go to sleep; shortly thereafter,
    the kworker thread that executed the aggregation will go idle and cause
    a scheduling change, during which the psi callback will kick the
    !pending worker again.  This will ping-pong forever, and is equivalent
    to having no shut-off logic at all (but with more code!)
    
    Fix this by exempting aggregation workers from psi's clock waking logic
    when the state change is them going to sleep.  To do this, tag workers
    with the last work function they executed, and if in psi we see a worker
    going to sleep after aggregating psi data, we will not reschedule the
    aggregation work item.
    
    What if the worker is also executing other items before or after?
    
    Any psi state times that were incurred by work items preceding the
    aggregation work will have been collected from the per-cpu buckets
    during the aggregation itself.  If there are work items following the
    aggregation work, the worker's last_func tag will be overwritten and the
    aggregator will be kept alive to process this genuine new activity.
    
    If the aggregation work is the last thing the worker does, and we decide
    to go idle, the brief period of non-idle time incurred between the
    aggregation run and the kworker's dequeue will be stranded in the
    per-cpu buckets until the clock is woken by later activity.  But that
    should not be a problem.  The buckets can hold 4s worth of time, and
    future activity will wake the clock with a 2s delay, giving us 2s worth
    of data we can leave behind when disabling aggregation.  If it takes a
    worker more than two seconds to go idle after it finishes its last work
    item, we likely have bigger problems in the system, and won't notice one
    sample that was averaged with a bogus per-CPU weight.

    mm, memory_hotplug: test_pages_in_a_zone do not pass the end of zone
    
    [ Upstream commit 24feb47c5fa5b825efb0151f28906dfdad027e61 ]
    
    If memory end is not aligned with the sparse memory section boundary,
    the mapping of such a section is only partly initialized.  This may lead

    mm, memory_hotplug: is_mem_section_removable do not pass the end of a zone
    
    [ Upstream commit efad4e475c312456edb3c789d0996d12ed744c13 ]
    
    Patch series "mm, memory_hotplug: fix uninitialized pages fallouts", v2.
    
    Mikhail Zaslonko has posted fixes for the two bugs quite some time ago
    [1].  I have pushed back on those fixes because I believed that it is
    much better to plug the problem at the initialization time rather than
    play whack-a-mole all over the hotplug code and find all the places
    which expect the full memory section to be initialized.
    
    We have ended up with commit 2830bf6f05fb ("mm, memory_hotplug:
    initialize struct pages for the full memory section") merged and cause a
    regression [2][3].  The reason is that there might be memory layouts
    when two NUMA nodes share the same memory section so the merged fix is
    simply incorrect.
    
    In order to plug this hole we really have to be zone range aware in
    those handlers.  I have split up the original patch into two.  One is
    unchanged (patch 2) and I took a different approach for `removable'
    crash.

    This patch (of 2):
    
    Mikhail has reported the following VM_BUG_ON triggered when reading sysfs
    removable state of a memory block:

    The reason is that the memory block spans the zone boundary and we are

    range in is_mem_section_removable so that we never run away from a zone.

    x86_64: increase stack size for KASAN_EXTRA
    
    [ Upstream commit a8e911d13540487942d53137c156bd7707f66e5d ]
    
    If the kernel is configured with KASAN_EXTRA, the stack size is
    increasted significantly because this option sets "-fstack-reuse" to
    "none" in GCC [1].  As a result, it triggers stack overrun quite often
    with 32k stack size compiled using GCC 8.  For example, this reproducer
    
      https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/blob/master/testcases/kernel/syscalls/madvise/madvise06.c
    
    triggers a "corrupted stack end detected inside scheduler" very reliably
    with CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK enabled.
    
    There are just too many functions that could have a large stack with
    KASAN_EXTRA due to large local variables that have been called over and
    over again without being able to reuse the stacks.  Some noticiable ones
    are
    
      size
      7648 shrink_page_list
      3584 xfs_rmap_convert
      3312 migrate_page_move_mapping
      3312 dev_ethtool
      3200 migrate_misplaced_transhuge_page
      3168 copy_process
    
    There are other 49 functions are over 2k in size while compiling kernel
    with "-Wframe-larger-than=" even with a related minimal config on this
    machine.  Hence, it is too much work to change Makefiles for each object
    to compile without "-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope" individually.
    
    [1] https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=81715#c23
    
    Although there is a patch in GCC 9 to help the situation, GCC 9 probably
    won't be released in a few months and then it probably take another
    6-month to 1-year for all major distros to include it as a default.
    Hence, the stack usage with KASAN_EXTRA can be revisited again in 2020
    when GCC 9 is everywhere.  Until then, this patch will help users avoid
    stack overrun.
    
    This has already been fixed for arm64 for the same reason via
    6e8830674ea ("arm64: kasan: Increase stack size for KASAN_EXTRA").

    arm64: kprobe: Always blacklist the KVM world-switch code
    
    [ Upstream commit f2b3d8566d81deaca31f4e3163def0bea7746e11 ]
    
    On systems with VHE the kernel and KVM's world-switch code run at the
    same exception level. Code that is only used on a VHE system does not
    need to be annotated as __hyp_text as it can reside anywhere in the
     kernel text.
    
    __hyp_text was also used to prevent kprobes from patching breakpoint
    instructions into this region, as this code runs at a different
    exception level. While this is no longer true with VHE, KVM still
    switches VBAR_EL1, meaning a kprobe's breakpoint executed in the
    world-switch code will cause a hyp-panic.
    
    Move the __hyp_text check in the kprobes blacklist so it applies on
    VHE systems too, to cover the common code and guest enter/exit
    assembly.

    x86/microcode/amd: Don't falsely trick the late loading mechanism
    
    [ Upstream commit 912139cfbfa6a2bc1da052314d2c29338dae1f6a ]
    
    The load_microcode_amd() function searches for microcode patches and
    attempts to apply a microcode patch if it is of different level than the
    currently installed level.
    
    While the processor won't actually load a level that is less than
    what is already installed, the logic wrongly returns UCODE_NEW thus
    signaling to its caller reload_store() that a late loading should be
    attempted.
    
    If the file-system contains an older microcode revision than what is
    currently running, such a late microcode reload can result in these
    misleading messages:
    
      x86/CPU: CPU features have changed after loading microcode, but might not take effect.
      x86/CPU: Please consider either early loading through initrd/built-in or a potential BIOS update.
    
    These messages were issued on a system where SME/SEV are not
    enabled by the BIOS (MSR C001_0010[23] = 0b) because during boot,
    early_detect_mem_encrypt() is called and cleared the SME and SEV
    features in this case.
    
    However, after the wrong late load attempt, get_cpu_cap() is called and
    reloads the SME and SEV feature bits, resulting in the messages.
    
    Update the microcode level check to not attempt microcode loading if the
    current level is greater than(!) and not only equal to the current patch
    level.

    x86/boot/compressed/64: Set EFER.LME=1 in 32-bit trampoline before returning to long mode
    
    [ Upstream commit b677dfae5aa197afc5191755a76a8727ffca538a ]
    
    In some old AMD KVM implementation, guest's EFER.LME bit is cleared by KVM
    when the hypervsior detects that the guest sets CR0.PG to 0. This causes
    the guest OS to reboot when it tries to return from 32-bit trampoline code
    because the CPU is in incorrect state: CR4.PAE=1, CR0.PG=1, CS.L=1, but
    EFER.LME=0.  As a precaution, set EFER.LME=1 as part of long mode
    activation procedure. This extra step won't cause any harm when Linux is
    booted on a bare-metal machine.

    [ Upstream commit e501070e4db0b67a4c17a5557d1e9d098f3db310 ]
    
    The interrupt handler contains a workaround for RX hang applicable
    to Zynq and AT91RM9200 only. Subsequent versions do not need this
    workaround. This workaround unnecessarily resets RX whenever RX used
    bit read is observed, which can be often under heavy traffic. There
    is no other action performed on RX UBR interrupt. Hence introduce a
    CAPS mask; enable this interrupt and workaround only on affected
    versions.

    The issue to be fixed in this commit is when libfc found it received a
    invalid FLOGI response from FC switch, it would return without freeing the
    fc frame, which is just the skb data. This would cause memory leak if FC
    switch keeps sending invalid FLOGI responses.
    
    This fix is just to make it execute `fc_frame_free(fp)` before returning
    from function `fc_lport_flogi_resp`.

    qed: Fix VF probe failure while FLR
    
    [ Upstream commit 327852ec64205bb651be391a069784872098a3b2 ]
    
    VFs may hit VF-PF channel timeout while probing, as in some
    cases it was observed that VF FLR and VF "acquire" message
    transaction (i.e first message from VF to PF in VF's probe flow)
    could occur simultaneously which could lead VF to fail sending
    "acquire" message to PF as VF is marked disabled from HW perspective
    due to FLR, which will result into channel timeout and VF probe failure.
    
    In such cases, try retrying VF "acquire" message so that in later
    attempts it could be successful to pass message to PF after the VF
    FLR is completed and can be probed successfully.

    qed: Fix LACP pdu drops for VFs
    
    [ Upstream commit ff9296966e5e00b0d0d00477b2365a178f0f06a3 ]
    
    VF is always configured to drop control frames
    (with reserved mac addresses) but to work LACP
    on the VFs, it would require LACP control frames
    to be forwarded or transmitted successfully.
    
    This patch fixes this in such a way that trusted VFs
    (marked through ndo_set_vf_trust) would be allowed to
    pass the control frames such as LACP pdus.

    qed: Fix bug in tx promiscuous mode settings
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e71a15d8b5bbce25c637f7f8833cd3f45b65646 ]
    
    When running tx switched traffic between VNICs
    created via a bridge(to which VFs are added),
    adapter drops the unicast packets in tx flow due to
    VNIC's ucast mac being unknown to it. But VF interfaces
    being in promiscuous mode should have caused adapter
    to accept all the unknown ucast packets. Later, it
    was found that driver doesn't really configure tx
    promiscuous mode settings to accept all unknown unicast macs.
    
    This patch fixes tx promiscuous mode settings to accept all
    unknown/unmatched unicast macs and works out the scenario.

    gpio: vf610: Mask all GPIO interrupts
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ae710f9f8b2cf95297e7bbfe1c09789a7dc43d4 ]
    
    On SoC reset all GPIO interrupts are disable. However, if kexec is
    used to boot into a new kernel, the SoC does not experience a
    reset. Hence GPIO interrupts can be left enabled from the previous
    kernel. It is then possible for the interrupt to fire before an
    interrupt handler is registered, resulting in the kernel complaining
    of an "unexpected IRQ trap", the interrupt is never cleared, and so
    fires again, resulting in an interrupt storm.
    
    Disable all GPIO interrupts before registering the GPIO IRQ chip.

    netfilter: ebtables: compat: un-break 32bit setsockopt when no rules are present
    
    [ Upstream commit 2035f3ff8eaa29cfb5c8e2160b0f6e85eeb21a95 ]
    
    Unlike ip(6)tables ebtables only counts user-defined chains.
    
    The effect is that a 32bit ebtables binary on a 64bit kernel can do
    'ebtables -N FOO' only after adding at least one rule, else the request
    fails with -EINVAL.
    
    This is a similar fix as done in

    iomap: get/put the page in iomap_page_create/release()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8e47a457321ca1a74ad194ab5dcbca764bc70731 ]
    
    migrate_page_move_mapping() expects pages with private data set to have
    a page_count elevated by 1.  This is what used to happen for xfs through
    the buffer_heads code before the switch to iomap in commit 82cb14175e7d
    ("xfs: add support for sub-pagesize writeback without buffer_heads").
    Not having the count elevated causes move_pages() to fail on memory
    mapped files coming from xfs.
    
    Make iomap compatible with the migrate_page_move_mapping() assumption by
    elevating the page count as part of iomap_page_create() and lowering it
    in iomap_page_release().
    
    It causes the move_pages() syscall to misbehave on memory mapped files
    from xfs.  It does not not move any pages, which I suppose is "just" a
    perf issue, but it also ends up returning a positive number which is out
    of spec for the syscall.  Talking to Michal Hocko, it sounds like
    returning positive numbers might be a necessary update to move_pages()
    anyway though.

    [ Upstream commit 2b531b6137834a55857a337ac17510d6436b6fbb ]
    
    The cpu-hotplug test assumes that we can offline the maximum CPU as
    described by /sys/devices/system/cpu/offline.  However, in the case
    where the number of CPUs exceeds like kernel configuration then
    the offline count can be greater than the present count and we end
    up trying to test the offlining of a CPU that is not available to
    offline.  Fix this by testing the maximum present CPU instead.
    
    Also, the test currently offlines the CPU and does not online it,
    so fix this by onlining the CPU after the test.

    [ Upstream commit a2093dd35f8cfb28dd7c878ccbd020c1bb20d0d7 ]
    
    When allocating a umem leaf for implicit ODP MR during page fault the
    field owning_mm was not set.
    
    Initialize and take a reference on this field to avoid kernel panic when
    trying to access this field.

    Use disable_irq_nosync instead of disable_irq to avoid it.
    This is safe because the ccount timer IRQ is per-CPU, and once IRQ is

    [ Upstream commit 9ff1a3b4912528f853048ccd9757ba6a2cc75557 ]
    
    The clocks of the CPUSS such as "gcc_cpuss_ahb_clk_src" is a CRITICAL
    clock and needs to vote on the active only source of XO, so as to keep
    the vote as long as CPUSS is active. Similar rbcpr_clk_src is also has

    clk: ti: Fix error handling in ti_clk_parse_divider_data()
    
    [ Upstream commit 303aef8b84272d73999a3207dd05bbe10ed89dc5 ]
    
    The ti_clk_parse_divider_data() function is only called from
    _get_div_table_from_setup().  That function doesn't look at the return
    value but instead looks at the "*table" pointer.  In this case, if the
    kcalloc() fails then *table is NULL (which means success).  It should
    instead be an error pointer.
    
    The ti_clk_parse_divider_data() function has two callers.  One checks
    for errors and the other doesn't.  I have fixed it so now both handle
    errors.

    iommu/amd: Fix IOMMU page flush when detach device from a domain
    
    [ Upstream commit 9825bd94e3a2baae1f4874767ae3a7d4c049720e ]
    
    When a VM is terminated, the VFIO driver detaches all pass-through
    devices from VFIO domain by clearing domain id and page table root
    pointer from each device table entry (DTE), and then invalidates
    the DTE. Then, the VFIO driver unmap pages and invalidate IOMMU pages.
    
    Currently, the IOMMU driver keeps track of which IOMMU and how many
    devices are attached to the domain. When invalidate IOMMU pages,
    the driver checks if the IOMMU is still attached to the domain before
    issuing the invalidate page command.
    
    However, since VFIO has already detached all devices from the domain,
    the subsequent INVALIDATE_IOMMU_PAGES commands are being skipped as
    there is no IOMMU attached to the domain. This results in data
    corruption and could cause the PCI device to end up in indeterministic
    state.
    
    Fix this by invalidate IOMMU pages when detach a device, and
    before decrementing the per-domain device reference counts.

    [ Upstream commit f1724c0883bb0ce93b8dcb94b53dcca3b75ac9a7 ]
    
    In the error path of map_sg there is an incorrect if condition
    for breaking out of the loop that searches the scatterlist
    for mapped pages to unmap. Instead of breaking out of the
    loop once all the pages that were mapped have been unmapped,
    it will break out of the loop after it has unmapped 1 page.
    Fix the condition, so it breaks out of the loop only after
    all the mapped pages have been unmapped.

    IB/{hfi1, qib}: Fix WC.byte_len calculation for UD_SEND_WITH_IMM
    
    [ Upstream commit 904bba211acc2112fdf866e5a2bc6cd9ecd0de1b ]
    
    The work completion length for a receiving a UD send with immediate is
    short by 4 bytes causing application using this opcode to fail.
    
    The UD receive logic incorrectly subtracts 4 bytes for immediate
    value. These bytes are already included in header length and are used to
    calculate header/payload split, so the result is these 4 bytes are
    subtracted twice, once when the header length subtracted from the overall
    length and once again in the UD opcode specific path.
    
    Remove the extra subtraction when handling the opcode.

    [ Upstream commit 8bf8c6da53c2265aea365a1de6038f118f522113 ]
    
    While updating perf to work with Python3 and Python2 I noticed that the
    stat-cpi script was dumping core.
    
    $ perf  stat -e cycles,instructions record -o /tmp/perf.data /bin/false

    ...
    
    The issue is that since 1fcd03946b52 perf_stat__update_shadow_stats now calls
    update_runtime_stat passing rt_stat rather than calling update_stats but
    perf_stat__init_shadow_stats has never been called to initialize rt_stat in
    the script path processing recorded stat data.
    
    Since I can't see any reason why perf_stat__init_shadow_stats() is presently
    initialized like it is in builtin-script.c::perf_sample__fprint_metric()
    [4bd1bef8bba2f] I'm proposing it instead be initialized once in __cmd_script

    perf tools: Handle TOPOLOGY headers with no CPU
    
    [ Upstream commit 1497e804d1a6e2bd9107ddf64b0310449f4673eb ]
    
    This patch fixes an issue in cpumap.c when used with the TOPOLOGY
    header. In some configurations, some NUMA nodes may have no CPU (empty
    cpulist). Yet a cpumap map must be created otherwise perf abort with an
    error. This patch handles this case by creating a dummy map.
    
      Before:
    
      $ perf record -o - -e cycles noploop 2 | perf script -i -
      0x6e8 [0x6c]: failed to process type: 80
    
      After:
    
      $ perf record -o - -e cycles noploop 2 | perf script -i -
      noploop for 2 seconds

    perf python: Remove -fstack-clash-protection when building with some clang versions
    
    [ Upstream commit 94ec1eb711db69be1414b56b3160b816e86a5c5b ]
    
    These options are not present in some (all?) clang versions, so when we
    build for a distro that has a gcc new enough to have these options and
    that the distro python build config settings use them but clang doesn't
    support, b00m.
    
    This is the case with fedora rawhide (now gearing towards f30), so check
    if clang has the  and remove the missing ones from CFLAGS.

    perf core: Fix perf_proc_update_handler() bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a51c5da5acc6c188c917ba572eebac5f8793432 ]
    
    The perf_proc_update_handler() handles /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_sample_rate
    syctl variable.  When the PMU IRQ handler timing monitoring is disabled, i.e,
    when /proc/sys/kernel/perf_cpu_time_max_percent is equal to 0 or 100,
    then no modification to sysctl_perf_event_sample_rate is allowed to prevent
    possible hang from wrong values.
    
    The problem is that the test to prevent modification is made after the
    sysctl variable is modified in perf_proc_update_handler().
    
    You get an error:
    
      $ echo 10001 >/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_sample_rate
      echo: write error: invalid argument
    
    But the value is still modified causing all sorts of inconsistencies:
    
      $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_sample_rate
      10001
    
    This patch fixes the problem by moving the parsing of the value after
    the test.
    
    Committer testing:
    
      # echo 100 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_cpu_time_max_percent
      # echo 10001 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_sample_rate

    netfilter: nft_compat: destroy function must not have side effects
    
    [ Upstream commit b2e3d68d1251a051a620f9086e18f7ffa6833b5b ]
    
    The nft_compat destroy function deletes the nft_xt object from a list.
    This isn't allowed anymore. Destroy functions are called asynchronously,
    i.e. next batch can find the object that has a pending ->destroy()
    invocation:
    
    cpu0                       cpu1
     worker
       ->destroy               for_each_entry()
                                 if (x == ...
                                    return x->ops;
         list_del(x)
         kfree_rcu(x)
                               expr->ops->... // ops was free'd
    
    To resolve this, the list_del needs to occur before the transaction
    mutex gets released.  nf_tables has a 'deactivate' hook for this
    purpose, so use that to unlink the object from the list.

    netfilter: nft_compat: make lists per netns
    
    [ Upstream commit cf52572ebbd7189a1966c2b5fc34b97078cd1dce ]
    
    There are two problems with nft_compat since the netlink config
    plane uses a per-netns mutex:
    
    1. Concurrent add/del accesses to the same list
    2. accesses to a list element after it has been free'd already.
    
    This patch fixes the first problem.
    
    Freeing occurs from a work queue, after transaction mutexes have been
    released, i.e., it still possible for a new transaction (even from
    same net ns) to find the to-be-deleted expression in the list.
    
    The ->destroy functions are not allowed to have any such side effects,
    i.e. the list_del() in the destroy function is not allowed.
    
    This part of the problem is solved in the next patch.
    I tried to make this work by serializing list access via mutex
    and by moving list_del() to a deactivate callback, but
    Taehee spotted following race on this approach:
    
      NET #0                          NET #1
       >select_ops()
       ->init()
                                       ->select_ops()
       ->deactivate()
       ->destroy()
          nft_xt_put()
           kfree_rcu(xt, rcu_head);
                                       ->init() <-- use-after-free occurred.
    
    Unfortunately, we can't increment reference count in
    select_ops(), because we can't undo the refcount increase in
    case a different expression fails in the same batch.
    
    (The destroy hook will only be called in case the expression
     was initialized successfully).

    netfilter: nft_compat: use refcnt_t type for nft_xt reference count
    
    [ Upstream commit 12c44aba6618b7f6c437076e5722237190f6cd5f ]
    
    Using standard integer type was fine while all operations on it were
    guarded by the nftnl subsys mutex.
    
    This isn't true anymore:
    1. transactions are guarded only by a pernet mutex, so concurrent
       rule manipulation in different netns is racy
    2. the ->destroy hook runs from a work queue after the transaction
       mutex has been released already.
    
    cpu0                           cpu1 (net 1)        cpu2 (net 2)
     kworker
        nft_compat->destroy        nft_compat->init    nft_compat->init
          if (--nft_xt->ref == 0)   nft_xt->ref++        nft_xt->ref++
    
    Switch to refcount_t.  Doing this however only fixes a minor aspect,
    nft_compat also performs linked-list operations in an unsafe way.
    
    This is addressed in the next two patches.

    vti4: Fix a ipip packet processing bug in 'IPCOMP' virtual tunnel
    
    [ Upstream commit dd9ee3444014e8f28c0eefc9fffc9ac9c5248c12 ]
    
    Recently we run a network test over ipcomp virtual tunnel.We find that
    if a ipv4 packet needs fragment, then the peer can't receive
    it.
    
    We deep into the code and find that when packet need fragment the smaller
    fragment will be encapsulated by ipip not ipcomp. So when the ipip packet
    goes into xfrm, it's skb->dev is not properly set. The ipv4 reassembly code
    always set skb'dev to the last fragment's dev. After ipv4 defrag processing,
    when the kernel rp_filter parameter is set, the skb will be drop by -EXDEV
    error.
    
    This patch adds compatible support for the ipip process in ipcomp virtual tunnel.

    media: uvcvideo: Fix 'type' check leading to overflow
    
    commit 47bb117911b051bbc90764a8bff96543cbd2005f upstream.
    
    When initially testing the Camera Terminal Descriptor wTerminalType
    field (buffer[4]), no mask is used. Later in the function, the MSB is
    overloaded to store the descriptor subtype, and so a mask of 0x7fff
    is used to check the type.
    
    If a descriptor is specially crafted to set this overloaded bit in the
    original wTerminalType field, the initial type check will fail (falling
    through, without adjusting the buffer size), but the later type checks
    will pass, assuming the buffer has been made suitably large, causing an
    overflow.
    
    Avoid this problem by checking for the MSB in the wTerminalType field.
    If the bit is set, assume the descriptor is bad, and abort parsing it.
