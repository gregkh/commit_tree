    In skcipher_recvmsg_async, we use '!sreq->tsg' to determine does we
    calloc fail. However, kcalloc may return ZERO_SIZE_PTR, and with this,
    the latter sg_init_table will trigger the bug. Fix it be use ZERO_OF_NULL_PTR.
    
    This function was introduced with ' commit a596999b7ddf ("crypto:
    algif - change algif_skcipher to be asynchronous")', and has been removed

    dm cache: fix a crash due to incorrect work item cancelling
    
    commit 7cdf6a0aae1cccf5167f3f04ecddcf648b78e289 upstream.
    
    The crash can be reproduced by running the lvm2 testsuite test
    lvconvert-thin-external-cache.sh for several minutes, e.g.:
      while :; do make check T=shell/lvconvert-thin-external-cache.sh; done
    
    The crash happens in this call chain:
    do_waker -> policy_tick -> smq_tick -> end_hotspot_period -> clear_bitset
    -> memset -> __memset -- which accesses an invalid pointer in the vmalloc
    area.
    
    The work entry on the workqueue is executed even after the bitmap was
    freed. The problem is that cancel_delayed_work doesn't wait for the
    running work item to finish, so the work item can continue running and
    re-submitting itself even after cache_postsuspend. In order to make sure
    that the work item won't be running, we must use cancel_delayed_work_sync.
    
    Also, change flush_workqueue to drain_workqueue, so that if some work item
    submits itself or another work item, we are properly waiting for both of
    them.

    powerpc: fix hardware PMU exception bug on PowerVM compatibility mode systems
    
    commit fc37a1632d40c80c067eb1bc235139f5867a2667 upstream.
    
    PowerVM systems running compatibility mode on a few Power8 revisions are
    still vulnerable to the hardware defect that loses PMU exceptions arriving
    prior to a context switch.
    
    The software fix for this issue is enabled through the CPU_FTR_PMAO_BUG
    cpu_feature bit, nevertheless this bit also needs to be set for PowerVM
    compatibility mode systems.

    ARM: imx: build v7_cpu_resume() unconditionally
    
    commit 512a928affd51c2dc631401e56ad5ee5d5dd68b6 upstream.
    
    This function is not only needed by the platform suspend code, but is also
    reused as the CPU resume function when the ARM cores can be powered down
    completely in deep idle, which is the case on i.MX6SX and i.MX6UL(L).
    
    Providing the static inline stub whenever CONFIG_SUSPEND is disabled means
    that those platforms will hang on resume from cpuidle if suspend is disabled.
    
    So there are two problems:
    
      - The static inline stub masks the linker error
      - The function is not available where needed
    
    Fix both by just building the function unconditionally, when
    CONFIG_SOC_IMX6 is enabled. The actual code is three instructions long,
    so it's arguably ok to just leave it in for all i.MX6 kernel configurations.

    ASoC: dapm: Correct DAPM handling of active widgets during shutdown
    
    commit 9b3193089e77d3b59b045146ff1c770dd899acb1 upstream.
    
    commit c2caa4da46a4 ("ASoC: Fix widget powerdown on shutdown") added a
    set of the power state during snd_soc_dapm_shutdown to ensure the
    widgets powered off. However, when commit 39eb5fd13dff
    ("ASoC: dapm: Delay w->power update until the changes are written")
    added the new_power member of the widget structure, to differentiate
    between the current power state and the target power state, it did not
    update the shutdown to use the new_power member.
    
    As new_power has not updated it will be left in the state set by the
    last DAPM sequence, ie. 1 for active widgets. So as the DAPM sequence
    for the shutdown proceeds it will turn the widgets on (despite them
    already being on) rather than turning them off.

    dmaengine: tegra-apb: Prevent race conditions of tasklet vs free list
    
    commit c33ee1301c393a241d6424e36eff1071811b1064 upstream.
    
    The interrupt handler puts a half-completed DMA descriptor on a free list
    and then schedules tasklet to process bottom half of the descriptor that
    executes client's callback, this creates possibility to pick up the busy
    descriptor from the free list. Thus, let's disallow descriptor's re-use
    until it is fully processed.

    commit 94788af4ed039476ff3527b0e6a12c1dc42cb022 upstream.
    
    I was doing some experiments with I2C and noticed that Tegra APB DMA
    driver crashes sometime after I2C DMA transfer termination. The crash
    happens because tegra_dma_terminate_all() bails out immediately if pending
    list is empty, and thus, it doesn't release the half-completed descriptors
    which are getting re-used before ISR tasklet kicks-in.

    Clearly. From the above, we have:
     console_lock -> sel_lock
     sel_lock -> termios_rwsem
     termios_rwsem -> console_lock
    
    Fix this by reversing the console_lock -> sel_lock dependency in
    ioctl(TIOCL_SETSEL). First, lock sel_lock, then console_lock.

    vt: selection, push console lock down
    
    commit 4b70dd57a15d2f4685ac6e38056bad93e81e982f upstream.
    
    We need to nest the console lock in sel_lock, so we have to push it down
    a bit. Fortunately, the callers of set_selection_* just lock the console
    lock around the function call. So moving it down is easy.
    
    In the next patch, we switch the order.

    It is due to a race between parallel paste_selection (TIOCL_PASTESEL)
    and set_selection_user (TIOCL_SETSEL) invocations. One uses sel_buffer,
    while the other frees it and reallocates a new one for another
    selection. Add a mutex to close this race.
    
    The mutex takes care properly of sel_buffer and sel_buffer_lth only. The
    other selection global variables (like sel_start, sel_end, and sel_cons)
    are protected only in set_selection_user. The other functions need quite
    some more work to close the races of the variables there. This is going
    to happen later.
    
    This likely fixes (I am unsure as there is no reproducer provided) bug
    206361 too. It was marked as CVE-2020-8648.

    fat: fix uninit-memory access for partial initialized inode
    
    commit bc87302a093f0eab45cd4e250c2021299f712ec6 upstream.
    
    When get an error in the middle of reading an inode, some fields in the
    inode might be still not initialized.  And then the evict_inode path may
    access those fields via iput().
    
    To fix, this makes sure that inode fields are initialized.

        unsigned short xe;      /* X end */
        unsigned short ye;      /* Y end */
        unsigned short sel_mode; /* selection mode */
      };
    
      #define TIOCL_SETSEL    2
      struct tiocl {
        unsigned char type;
        unsigned char pad;
        struct tiocl_selection sel;
      };
    
      int main()
      {
        int fd = 0;
        const char *dev = "/dev/char/4:1";
    
        struct vt_consize v = {0};
        struct tiocl tioc = {0};
    
        fd = open(dev, O_RDWR, 0);
    
        v.v_rows = 3346;
        ioctl(fd, VT_RESIZEX, &v);
    
        tioc.type = TIOCL_SETSEL;
        ioctl(fd, TIOCLINUX, &tioc);
    
        return 0;
      }
    
    When resize the screen, update the 'vc->vc_size_row' to the new_row_size,
    but when 'set_origin' in 'vgacon_set_origin', vgacon use 'vga_vram_base'
    for 'vc_origin' and 'vc_visible_origin', not 'vc_screenbuf'. It maybe
    smaller than 'vc_screenbuf'. When TIOCLINUX, use the new_row_size to calc
    the offset, it maybe larger than the vga_vram_size in vgacon driver, then
    bad access.
    Also, if set an larger screenbuf firstly, then set an more larger
    screenbuf, when copy old_origin to new_origin, a bad access may happen.
    
    So, If the screen size larger than vga_vram, resize screen should be
    failed. This alse fix CVE-2020-8649 and CVE-2020-8647.
    
    Linus pointed out that overflow checking seems absent. We're saved by
    the existing bounds checks in vc_do_resize() with rather strict
    limits:
    
            if (cols > VC_RESIZE_MAXCOL || lines > VC_RESIZE_MAXROW)
                    return -EINVAL;

    commit 86d92f5465958752481269348d474414dccb1552 upstream.
    
    Current driver has 240 (USB2.0) and 2048 (USB3.0) as max_sectors,
    e.g., /sys/bus/scsi/devices/0:0:0:0/max_sectors
    
    If data access times out, driver error handling will issue a port
    reset.
    Sometimes Samsung Fit (090C:1000) flash disk will not respond to
    later Set Address or Get Descriptor command.
    
    Adding this quirk to limit max_sectors to 64 sectors to avoid issue

    cifs: don't leak -EAGAIN for stat() during reconnect
    
    commit fc513fac56e1b626ae48a74d7551d9c35c50129e upstream.
    
    If from cifs_revalidate_dentry_attr() the SMB2/QUERY_INFO call fails with an
    error, such as STATUS_SESSION_EXPIRED, causing the session to be reconnected
    it is possible we will leak -EAGAIN back to the application even for
    system calls such as stat() where this is not a valid error.
    
    Fix this by re-trying the operation from within cifs_revalidate_dentry_attr()
    if cifs_get_inode_info*() returns -EAGAIN.
    
    This fixes stat() and possibly also other system calls that uses
    cifs_revalidate_dentry*().

    watchdog: da9062: do not ping the hw during stop()
    
    [ Upstream commit e9a0e65eda3f78d0b04ec6136c591c000cbc3b76 ]
    
    The da9062 hw has a minimum ping cool down phase of at least 200ms. The
    driver takes that into account by setting the min_hw_heartbeat_ms to
    300ms and the core guarantees that the hw limit is observed for the
    ping() calls. But the core can't guarantee the required minimum ping
    cool down phase if a stop() command is send immediately after the ping()
    command. So it is not allowed to ping the watchdog within the stop()
    command as the driver does. Remove the ping can be done without doubts
    because the watchdog gets disabled anyway and a (re)start resets the
    watchdog counter too.

    net: ks8851-ml: Fix 16-bit IO operation
    
    [ Upstream commit 58292104832fef6cb4a89f736012c0e0724c3442 ]
    
    The Micrel KSZ8851-16MLLI datasheet DS00002357B page 12 states that
    BE[3:0] signals are active high. This contradicts the measurements
    of the behavior of the actual chip, where these signals behave as
    active low. For example, to read the CIDER register, the bus must
    expose 0xc0c0 during the address phase, which means BE[3:0]=4'b1100.

    net: ks8851-ml: Remove 8-bit bus accessors
    
    [ Upstream commit 69233bba6543a37755158ca3382765387b8078df ]
    
    This driver is mixing 8-bit and 16-bit bus accessors for reasons unknown,
    however the speculation is that this was some sort of attempt to support
    the 8-bit bus mode.
    
    As per the KS8851-16MLL documentation, all two registers accessed via the
    8-bit accessors are internally 16-bit registers, so reading them using
    16-bit accessors is fine. The KS_CCR read can be converted to 16-bit read
    outright, as it is already a concatenation of two 8-bit reads of that
    register. The KS_RXQCR accesses are 8-bit only, however writing the top
    8 bits of the register is OK as well, since the driver caches the entire
    16-bit register value anyway.
    
    Finally, the driver is not used by any hardware in the kernel right now.
    The only hardware available to me is one with 16-bit bus, so I have no
    way to test the 8-bit bus mode, however it is unlikely this ever really
    worked anyway. If the 8-bit bus mode is ever required, it can be easily
    added by adjusting the 16-bit accessors to do 2 consecutive accesses,
    which is how this should have been done from the beginning.

    drm: msm: Fix return type of dsi_mgr_connector_mode_valid for kCFI
    
    [ Upstream commit 7fd2dfc3694922eb7ace4801b7208cf9f62ebc7d ]
    
    I was hitting kCFI crashes when building with clang, and after
    some digging finally narrowed it down to the
    dsi_mgr_connector_mode_valid() function being implemented as
    returning an int, instead of an enum drm_mode_status.
    
    This patch fixes it, and appeases the opaque word of the kCFI
    gods (seriously, clang inlining everything makes the kCFI
    backtraces only really rough estimates of where things went
    wrong).
    
    Thanks as always to Sami for his help narrowing this down.

    [ Upstream commit e4bfded56cf39b8d02733c1e6ef546b97961e18a ]
    
    Symptom: application opens /dev/ttyGS0 and starts sending (writing) to
    it while either USB cable is not connected, or nobody listens on the
    other side of the cable. If driver circular buffer overflows before
    connection is established, no data will be written to the USB layer
    until/unless /dev/ttyGS0 is closed and re-opened again by the
    application (the latter besides having no means of being notified about
    the event of establishing of the connection.)
    
    Fix: on open and/or connect, kick Tx to flush circular buffer data to
    USB layer.

    serial: ar933x_uart: set UART_CS_{RX,TX}_READY_ORIDE
    
    [ Upstream commit 87c5cbf71ecbb9e289d60a2df22eb686c70bf196 ]
    
    On AR934x this UART is usually not initialized by the bootloader
    as it is only used as a secondary serial port while the primary
    UART is a newly introduced NS16550-compatible.
    In order to make use of the ar933x-uart on AR934x without RTS/CTS
    hardware flow control, one needs to set the
    UART_CS_{RX,TX}_READY_ORIDE bits as other than on AR933x where this
    UART is used as primary/console, the bootloader on AR934x typically
    doesn't set those bits.
    Setting them explicitely on AR933x should not do any harm, so just
    set them unconditionally.

    mm, gup: ensure real head page is ref-counted when using hugepages
    
    commit d63206ee32b6e64b0e12d46e5d6004afd9913713 upstream.
    
    When speculatively taking references to a hugepage using
    page_cache_add_speculative() in gup_huge_pmd(), it is assumed that the
    page returned by pmd_page() is the head page.  Although normally true,
    this assumption doesn't hold when the hugepage comprises of successive
    page table entries such as when using contiguous bit on arm64 at PTE or
    PMD levels.
    
    This can be addressed by ensuring that the page passed to
    page_cache_add_speculative() is the real head or by de-referencing the
    head page within the function.
    
    We take the first approach to keep the usage pattern aligned with
    page_cache_get_speculative() where users already pass the appropriate
    page, i.e., the de-referenced head.
    
    Apply the same logic to fix gup_huge_[pud|pgd]() as well.

    mm, gup: remove broken VM_BUG_ON_PAGE compound check for hugepages
    
    commit a3e328556d41bb61c55f9dfcc62d6a826ea97b85 upstream.
    
    When operating on hugepages with DEBUG_VM enabled, the GUP code checks
    the compound head for each tail page prior to calling
    page_cache_add_speculative.  This is broken, because on the fast-GUP
    path (where we don't hold any page table locks) we can be racing with a
    concurrent invocation of split_huge_page_to_list.
    
    split_huge_page_to_list deals with this race by using page_ref_freeze to
    freeze the page and force concurrent GUPs to fail whilst the component
    pages are modified.  This modification includes clearing the
    compound_head field for the tail pages, so checking this prior to a
    successful call to page_cache_add_speculative can lead to false
    positives: In fact, page_cache_add_speculative *already* has this check
    once the page refcount has been successfully updated, so we can simply
    remove the broken calls to VM_BUG_ON_PAGE.

    mm: add 'try_get_page()' helper function
    
    commit 88b1a17dfc3ed7728316478fae0f5ad508f50397 upsteam.
    
    This is the same as the traditional 'get_page()' function, but instead
    of unconditionally incrementing the reference count of the page, it only
    does so if the count was "safe".  It returns whether the reference count
    was incremented (and is marked __must_check, since the caller obviously
    has to be aware of it).
    
    Also like 'get_page()', you can't use this function unless you already
    had a reference to the page.  The intent is that you can use this
    exactly like get_page(), but in situations where you want to limit the
    maximum reference count.
    
    The code currently does an unconditional WARN_ON_ONCE() if we ever hit
    the reference count issues (either zero or negative), as a notification
    that the conditional non-increment actually happened.
    
    NOTE! The count access for the "safety" check is inherently racy, but
    that doesn't matter since the buffer we use is basically half the range
    of the reference count (ie we look at the sign of the count).

    mm: make page ref count overflow check tighter and more explicit
    
    commit f958d7b528b1b40c44cfda5eabe2d82760d868c3 upsteam.
    
    We have a VM_BUG_ON() to check that the page reference count doesn't
    underflow (or get close to overflow) by checking the sign of the count.
    
    That's all fine, but we actually want to allow people to use a "get page
    ref unless it's already very high" helper function, and we want that one
    to use the sign of the page ref (without triggering this VM_BUG_ON).
    
    Change the VM_BUG_ON to only check for small underflows (or _very_ close
    to overflowing), and ignore overflows which have strayed into negative
    territory.

    KVM: Check for a bad hva before dropping into the ghc slow path
    
    commit fcfbc617547fc6d9552cb6c1c563b6a90ee98085 upstream.
    
    When reading/writing using the guest/host cache, check for a bad hva
    before checking for a NULL memslot, which triggers the slow path for
    handing cross-page accesses.  Because the memslot is nullified on error
    by __kvm_gfn_to_hva_cache_init(), if the bad hva is encountered after
    crossing into a new page, then the kvm_{read,write}_guest() slow path
    could potentially write/access the first chunk prior to detecting the
    bad hva.
    
    Arguably, performing a partial access is semantically correct from an
    architectural perspective, but that behavior is certainly not intended.
    In the original implementation, memslot was not explicitly nullified
    and therefore the partial access behavior varied based on whether the
    memslot itself was null, or if the hva was simply bad.  The current
    behavior was introduced as a seemingly unintentional side effect in
    commit f1b9dd5eb86c ("kvm: Disallow wraparound in
    kvm_gfn_to_hva_cache_init"), which justified the change with "since some
    callers don't check the return code from this function, it sit seems
    prudent to clear ghc->memslot in the event of an error".
    
    Regardless of intent, the partial access is dependent on _not_ checking
    the result of the cache initialization, which is arguably a bug in its
    own right, at best simply weird.

    namei: only return -ECHILD from follow_dotdot_rcu()
    
    commit 2b98149c2377bff12be5dd3ce02ae0506e2dd613 upstream.
    
    It's over-zealous to return hard errors under RCU-walk here, given that
    a REF-walk will be triggered for all other cases handling ".." under
    RCU.
    
    The original purpose of this check was to ensure that if a rename occurs
    such that a directory is moved outside of the bind-mount which the
    resolution started in, it would be detected and blocked to avoid being
    able to mess with paths outside of the bind-mount. However, triggering a
    new REF-walk is just as effective a solution.

    net: netlink: cap max groups which will be considered in netlink_bind()
    
    commit 3a20773beeeeadec41477a5ba872175b778ff752 upstream.
    
    Since nl_groups is a u32 we can't bind more groups via ->bind
    (netlink_bind) call, but netlink has supported more groups via
    setsockopt() for a long time and thus nlk->ngroups could be over 32.
    Recently I added support for per-vlan notifications and increased the
    groups to 33 for NETLINK_ROUTE which exposed an old bug in the
    netlink_bind() code causing out-of-bounds access on archs where unsigned
    long is 32 bits via test_bit() on a local variable. Fix this by capping the
    maximum groups in netlink_bind() to BITS_PER_TYPE(u32), effectively
    capping them at 32 which is the minimum of allocated groups and the
    maximum groups which can be bound via netlink_bind().

    ecryptfs: Fix up bad backport of fe2e082f5da5b4a0a92ae32978f81507ef37ec66
    
    When doing the 4.9 merge into certain Android trees, I noticed a warning
    from Android's deprecated GCC 4.9.4, which causes a build failure in
    those trees due to basically -Werror:
    
    fs/ecryptfs/keystore.c: In function 'ecryptfs_parse_packet_set':
    fs/ecryptfs/keystore.c:1357:2: warning: 'auth_tok_list_item' may be used

                                          ^
    
    GCC 9.2.0 was not able to pick up this warning when I tested it.
    
    Turns out that Clang warns as well when -Wuninitialized is used, which
    is not the case in older stable trees at the moment (but shows value in
    potentially backporting the various warning fixes currently in upstream
    to get more coverage).

    1 warning generated.
    
    Somehow, commit fe2e082f5da5 ("ecryptfs: fix a memory leak bug in
    parse_tag_1_packet()") upstream was not applied in the correct if block
    in 4.4.215, 4.9.215, and 4.14.172, which will indeed lead to use of
    uninitialized memory. Fix it up by undoing the bad backport in those
    trees then reapplying the patch in the proper location.

    In case a report is greater than HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE, it is truncated,

    system crash.
    
    Note: With commit 8ec321e96e05 ("HID: Fix slab-out-of-bounds read in
    hid_field_extract") I no longer hit the kernel Oops as we instead fail
    "controlled" at probe if there is a report too long in the HID
    report-descriptor. hid_report_raw_event() is an exported symbol, so
    presumabely we cannot always rely on this being the case.

    audit: fix error handling in audit_data_to_entry()
    
    commit 2ad3e17ebf94b7b7f3f64c050ff168f9915345eb upstream.
    
    Commit 219ca39427bf ("audit: use union for audit_field values since
    they are mutually exclusive") combined a number of separate fields in
    the audit_field struct into a single union.  Generally this worked
    just fine because they are generally mutually exclusive.
    Unfortunately in audit_data_to_entry() the overlap can be a problem
    when a specific error case is triggered that causes the error path
    code to attempt to cleanup an audit_field struct and the cleanup
    involves attempting to free a stored LSM string (the lsm_str field).
    Currently the code always has a non-NULL value in the
    audit_field.lsm_str field as the top of the for-loop transfers a
    value into audit_field.val (both .lsm_str and .val are part of the
    same union); if audit_data_to_entry() fails and the audit_field
    struct is specified to contain a LSM string, but the
    audit_field.lsm_str has not yet been properly set, the error handling
    code will attempt to free the bogus audit_field.lsm_str value that
    was set with audit_field.val at the top of the for-loop.
    
    This patch corrects this by ensuring that the audit_field.val is only
    set when needed (it is cleared when the audit_field struct is

    ext4: potential crash on allocation error in ext4_alloc_flex_bg_array()
    
    commit 37b0b6b8b99c0e1c1f11abbe7cf49b6d03795b3f upstream.
    
    If sbi->s_flex_groups_allocated is zero and the first allocation fails
    then this code will crash.  The problem is that "i--" will set "i" to
    -1 but when we compare "i >= sbi->s_flex_groups_allocated" then the -1
    is type promoted to unsigned and becomes UINT_MAX.  Since UINT_MAX
    is more than zero, the condition is true so we call kvfree(new_groups[-1]).
    The loop will carry on freeing invalid memory until it crashes.

    net: sched: correct flower port blocking
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a9093c79863b58cc2f9874d7ae788f0d622a596 ]
    
    tc flower rules that are based on src or dst port blocking are sometimes
    ineffective due to uninitialized stack data. __skb_flow_dissect() extracts
    ports from the skb for tc flower to match against. However, the port
    dissection is not done when when the FLOW_DIS_IS_FRAGMENT bit is set in
    key_control->flags. All callers of __skb_flow_dissect(), zero-out the
    key_control field except for fl_classify() as used by the flower
    classifier. Thus, the FLOW_DIS_IS_FRAGMENT may be set on entry to
    __skb_flow_dissect(), since key_control is allocated on the stack
    and may not be initialized.
    
    Since key_basic and key_control are present for all flow keys, let's
    make sure they are initialized.

    nfc: pn544: Fix occasional HW initialization failure
    
    [ Upstream commit c3331d2fe3fd4d5e321f2467d01f72de7edfb5d0 ]
    
    The PN544 driver checks the "enable" polarity during of driver's probe and
    it's doing that by turning ON and OFF NFC with different polarities until
    enabling succeeds. It takes some time for the hardware to power-down, and
    thus, to deassert the IRQ that is raised by turning ON the hardware.
    Since the delay after last power-down of the polarity-checking process is
    missed in the code, the interrupt may trigger immediately after installing
    the IRQ handler (right after the checking is done), which results in IRQ
    handler trying to touch the disabled HW and ends with marking NFC as
    'DEAD' during of the driver's probe:
    
      pn544_hci_i2c 1-002a: NFC: nfc_en polarity : active high
      pn544_hci_i2c 1-002a: NFC: invalid len byte
      shdlc: llc_shdlc_recv_frame: NULL Frame -> link is dead
    
    This patch fixes the occasional NFC initialization failure on Nexus 7
    device.

    sctp: move the format error check out of __sctp_sf_do_9_1_abort
    
    [ Upstream commit 245709ec8be89af46ea7ef0444c9c80913999d99 ]
    
    When T2 timer is to be stopped, the asoc should also be deleted,
    otherwise, there will be no chance to call sctp_association_free
    and the asoc could last in memory forever.
    
    However, in sctp_sf_shutdown_sent_abort(), after adding the cmd
    SCTP_CMD_TIMER_STOP for T2 timer, it may return error due to the
    format error from __sctp_sf_do_9_1_abort() and miss adding
    SCTP_CMD_ASSOC_FAILED where the asoc will be deleted.
    
    This patch is to fix it by moving the format error check out of
    __sctp_sf_do_9_1_abort(), and do it before adding the cmd
    SCTP_CMD_TIMER_STOP for T2 timer.
    
    Thanks Hangbin for reporting this issue by the fuzz testing.

    ipv6: Fix route replacement with dev-only route
    
    [ Upstream commit e404b8c7cfb31654c9024d497cec58a501501692 ]
    
    After commit 27596472473a ("ipv6: fix ECMP route replacement") it is no
    longer possible to replace an ECMP-able route by a non ECMP-able route.
    For example,
            ip route add 2001:db8::1/128 via fe80::1 dev dummy0
            ip route replace 2001:db8::1/128 dev dummy0
    does not work as expected.
    
    Tweak the replacement logic so that point 3 in the log of the above commit
    becomes:
    3. If the new route is not ECMP-able, and no matching non-ECMP-able route
    exists, replace matching ECMP-able route (if any) or add the new route.
    
    We can now summarize the entire replace semantics to:
    When doing a replace, prefer replacing a matching route of the same
    "ECMP-able-ness" as the replace argument. If there is no such candidate,
    fallback to the first route found.

    ipv6: Fix nlmsg_flags when splitting a multipath route
    
    [ Upstream commit afecdb376bd81d7e16578f0cfe82a1aec7ae18f3 ]
    
    When splitting an RTA_MULTIPATH request into multiple routes and adding the
    second and later components, we must not simply remove NLM_F_REPLACE but
    instead replace it by NLM_F_CREATE. Otherwise, it may look like the netlink
    message was malformed.
    
    For example,
            ip route add 2001:db8::1/128 dev dummy0
            ip route change 2001:db8::1/128 nexthop via fe80::30:1 dev dummy0 \
                    nexthop via fe80::30:2 dev dummy0
    results in the following warnings:
    [ 1035.057019] IPv6: RTM_NEWROUTE with no NLM_F_CREATE or NLM_F_REPLACE
    [ 1035.057517] IPv6: NLM_F_CREATE should be set when creating new route
    
    This patch makes the nlmsg sequence look equivalent for __ip6_ins_rt() to
    what it would get if the multipath route had been added in multiple netlink
    operations:
            ip route add 2001:db8::1/128 dev dummy0
            ip route change 2001:db8::1/128 nexthop via fe80::30:1 dev dummy0
            ip route append 2001:db8::1/128 nexthop via fe80::30:2 dev dummy0

    mac80211: consider more elements in parsing CRC
    
    [ Upstream commit a04564c99bb4a92f805a58e56b2d22cc4978f152 ]
    
    We only use the parsing CRC for checking if a beacon changed,
    and elements with an ID > 63 cannot be represented in the
    filter. Thus, like we did before with WMM and Cisco vendor
    elements, just statically add these forgotten items to the
    CRC:
     - WLAN_EID_VHT_OPERATION
     - WLAN_EID_OPMODE_NOTIF
    
    I guess that in most cases when VHT/HE operation change, the HT
    operation also changed, and so the change was picked up, but we
    did notice that pure operating mode notification changes were
    ignored.

    ext4: fix potential race between s_flex_groups online resizing and access
    
    commit 7c990728b99ed6fbe9c75fc202fce1172d9916da upstream.
    
    During an online resize an array of s_flex_groups structures gets replaced
    so it can get enlarged. If there is a concurrent access to the array and
    this memory has been reused then this can lead to an invalid memory access.
    
    The s_flex_group array has been converted into an array of pointers rather
    than an array of structures. This is to ensure that the information
    contained in the structures cannot get out of sync during a resize due to
    an accessor updating the value in the old structure after it has been
    copied but before the array pointer is updated. Since the structures them-
    selves are no longer copied but only the pointers to them this case is
    mitigated.

    ext4: fix potential race between online resizing and write operations
    
    commit 1d0c3924a92e69bfa91163bda83c12a994b4d106 upstream.
    
    During an online resize an array of pointers to buffer heads gets
    replaced so it can get enlarged.  If there is a racing block
    allocation or deallocation which uses the old array, and the old array
    has gotten reused this can lead to a GPF or some other random kernel
    memory getting modified.

    iwlwifi: pcie: fix rb_allocator workqueue allocation
    
    commit 8188a18ee2e48c9a7461139838048363bfce3fef upstream
    
    We don't handle failures in the rb_allocator workqueue allocation
    correctly. To fix that, move the code earlier so the cleanup is
    easier and we don't have to undo all the interrupt allocations in
    this case.
