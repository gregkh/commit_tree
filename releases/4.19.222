    xen/netback: don't queue unlimited number of packages
    
    commit be81992f9086b230623ae3ebbc85ecee4d00a3d3 upstream.
    
    In case a guest isn't consuming incoming network traffic as fast as it
    is coming in, xen-netback is buffering network packages in unlimited
    numbers today. This can result in host OOM situations.
    
    Commit f48da8b14d04ca8 ("xen-netback: fix unlimited guest Rx internal
    queue and carrier flapping") meant to introduce a mechanism to limit
    the amount of buffered data by stopping the Tx queue when reaching the
    data limit, but this doesn't work for cases like UDP.
    
    When hitting the limit don't queue further SKBs, but drop them instead.
    In order to be able to tell Rx packages have been dropped increment the
    rx_dropped statistics counter in this case.
    
    It should be noted that the old solution to continue queueing SKBs had
    the additional problem of an overflow of the 32-bit rx_queue_len value
    would result in intermittent Tx queue enabling.
    
    This is part of XSA-392

    xen/netback: fix rx queue stall detection
    
    commit 6032046ec4b70176d247a71836186d47b25d1684 upstream.
    
    Commit 1d5d48523900a4b ("xen-netback: require fewer guest Rx slots when
    not using GSO") introduced a security problem in netback, as an
    interface would only be regarded to be stalled if no slot is available
    in the rx queue ring page. In case the SKB at the head of the queued
    requests will need more than one rx slot and only one slot is free the
    stall detection logic will never trigger, as the test for that is only
    looking for at least one slot to be free.
    
    Fix that by testing for the needed number of slots instead of only one
    slot being available.
    
    In order to not have to take the rx queue lock that often, store the
    number of needed slots in the queue data. As all SKB dequeue operations
    happen in the rx queue kernel thread this is safe, as long as the
    number of needed slots is accessed via READ/WRITE_ONCE() only and
    updates are always done with the rx queue lock held.
    
    Add a small helper for obtaining the number of free slots.
    
    This is part of XSA-392

    xen/console: harden hvc_xen against event channel storms
    
    This is commit fe415186b43df0db1f17fa3a46275fd92107fe71 upstream.
    
    The Xen console driver is still vulnerable for an attack via excessive
    number of events sent by the backend. Fix that by using a lateeoi event
    channel.
    
    For the normal domU initial console this requires the introduction of
    bind_evtchn_to_irq_lateeoi() as there is no xenbus device available
    at the time the event channel is bound to the irq.
    
    As the decision whether an interrupt was spurious or not requires to
    test for bytes having been read from the backend, move sending the
    event into the if statement, as sending an event without having found
    any bytes to be read is making no sense at all.

    ovl: fix warning in ovl_create_real()
    
    commit 1f5573cfe7a7056e80a92c7a037a3e69f3a13d1c upstream.
    
    Syzbot triggered the following warning in ovl_workdir_create() ->
    ovl_create_real():
    
            if (!err && WARN_ON(!newdentry->d_inode)) {
    
    The reason is that the cgroup2 filesystem returns from mkdir without
    instantiating the new dentry.
    
    Weird filesystems such as this will be rejected by overlayfs at a later
    stage during setup, but to prevent such a warning, call ovl_mkdir_real()
    directly from ovl_workdir_create() and reject this case early.

    media: mxl111sf: change mutex_init() location
    
    commit 44870a9e7a3c24acbb3f888b2a7cc22c9bdf7e7f upstream.
    
    Syzbot reported, that mxl111sf_ctrl_msg() uses uninitialized
    mutex. The problem was in wrong mutex_init() location.
    
    Previous mutex_init(&state->msg_lock) call was in ->init() function, but
    dvb_usbv2_init() has this order of calls:
    
            dvb_usbv2_init()
              dvb_usbv2_adapter_init()
                dvb_usbv2_adapter_frontend_init()
                  props->frontend_attach()
    
              props->init()
    
    Since mxl111sf_* devices call mxl111sf_ctrl_msg() in ->frontend_attach()
    internally we need to initialize state->msg_lock before
    frontend_attach(). To achieve it, ->probe() call added to all mxl111sf_*
    devices, which will simply initiaize mutex.

    Input: touchscreen - avoid bitwise vs logical OR warning
    
    commit a02dcde595f7cbd240ccd64de96034ad91cffc40 upstream.
    
    A new warning in clang points out a few places in this driver where a
    bitwise OR is being used with boolean types:
    
    drivers/input/touchscreen.c:81:17: warning: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
            data_present = touchscreen_get_prop_u32(dev, "touchscreen-min-x",
                           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    This use of a bitwise OR is intentional, as bitwise operations do not
    short circuit, which allows all the calls to touchscreen_get_prop_u32()
    to happen so that the last parameter is initialized while coalescing the
    results of the calls to make a decision after they are all evaluated.
    
    To make this clearer to the compiler, use the '|=' operator to assign
    the result of each touchscreen_get_prop_u32() call to data_present,
    which keeps the meaning of the code the same but makes it obvious that
    every one of these calls is expected to happen.

    ARM: 8800/1: use choice for kernel unwinders
    
    commit f9b58e8c7d031b0daa5c9a9ee27f5a4028ba53ac upstream.
    
    While in theory multiple unwinders could be compiled in, it does
    not make sense in practise. Use a choice to make the unwinder
    selection mutually exclusive and mandatory.
    
    Already before this commit it has not been possible to deselect
    FRAME_POINTER. Remove the obsolete comment.
    
    Furthermore, to produce a meaningful backtrace with FRAME_POINTER
    enabled the kernel needs a specific function prologue:
        mov    ip, sp
        stmfd    sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
        sub    fp, ip, #4
    
    To get to the required prologue gcc uses apcs and no-sched-prolog.
    This compiler options are not available on clang, and clang is not
    able to generate the required prologue. Make the FRAME_POINTER
    config symbol depending on !clang.

    mwifiex: Remove unnecessary braces from HostCmd_SET_SEQ_NO_BSS_INFO
    
    commit 6a953dc4dbd1c7057fb765a24f37a5e953c85fb0 upstream.
    
    A new warning in clang points out when macro expansion might result in a
    GNU C statement expression. There is an instance of this in the mwifiex
    driver:
    
    drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/cmdevt.c:217:34: warning: '}' and
    ')' tokens terminating statement expression appear in different macro
    expansion contexts [-Wcompound-token-split-by-macro]
            host_cmd->seq_num = cpu_to_le16(HostCmd_SET_SEQ_NO_BSS_INFO
                                            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                                                        ^
    
    This does not appear to be a real issue. Removing the braces and
    replacing them with parentheses will fix the warning and not change the

    ARM: 8805/2: remove unneeded naked function usage
    
    commit b99afae1390140f5b0039e6b37a7380de31ae874 upstream.
    
    The naked attribute is known to confuse some old gcc versions when
    function arguments aren't explicitly listed as inline assembly operands
    despite the gcc documentation. That resulted in commit 9a40ac86152c
    ("ARM: 6164/1: Add kto and kfrom to input operands list.").
    
    Yet that commit has problems of its own by having assembly operand
    constraints completely wrong. If the generated code has been OK since
    then, it is due to luck rather than correctness. So this patch also
    provides proper assembly operand constraints, and removes two instances
    of redundant register usages in the implementation while at it.
    
    Inspection of the generated code with this patch doesn't show any
    obvious quality degradation either, so not relying on __naked at all
    will make the code less fragile, and avoid some issues with clang.
    
    The only remaining __naked instances (excluding the kprobes test cases)
    are exynos_pm_power_up_setup(), tc2_pm_power_up_setup() and
    
    cci_enable_port_for_self(. But in the first two cases, only the function
    address is used by the compiler with no chance of inlining it by
    mistake, and the third case is called from assembly code only. And the
    fact that no stack is available when the corresponding code is executed
    does warrant the __naked usage in those cases.

    net: systemport: Add global locking for descriptor lifecycle
    
    commit 8b8e6e782456f1ce02a7ae914bbd5b1053f0b034 upstream.
    
    The descriptor list is a shared resource across all of the transmit queues, and
    the locking mechanism used today only protects concurrency across a given
    transmit queue between the transmit and reclaiming. This creates an opportunity
    for the SYSTEMPORT hardware to work on corrupted descriptors if we have
    multiple producers at once which is the case when using multiple transmit
    queues.
    
    This was particularly noticeable when using multiple flows/transmit queues and
    it showed up in interesting ways in that UDP packets would get a correct UDP
    header checksum being calculated over an incorrect packet length. Similarly TCP
    packets would get an equally correct checksum computed by the hardware over an
    incorrect packet length.
    
    The SYSTEMPORT hardware maintains an internal descriptor list that it re-arranges
    when the driver produces a new descriptor anytime it writes to the
    WRITE_PORT_{HI,LO} registers, there is however some delay in the hardware to
    re-organize its descriptors and it is possible that concurrent TX queues
    eventually break this internal allocation scheme to the point where the
    length/status part of the descriptor gets used for an incorrect data buffer.
    
    The fix is to impose a global serialization for all TX queues in the short
    section where we are writing to the WRITE_PORT_{HI,LO} registers which solves
    the corruption even with multiple concurrent TX queues being used.

    timekeeping: Really make sure wall_to_monotonic isn't positive
    
    commit 4e8c11b6b3f0b6a283e898344f154641eda94266 upstream.
    
    Even after commit e1d7ba873555 ("time: Always make sure wall_to_monotonic
    isn't positive") it is still possible to make wall_to_monotonic positive
    by running the following code:
    
        int main(void)
        {
            struct timespec time;
    
            clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &time);
            time.tv_nsec = 0;
            clock_settime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &time);
            return 0;
        }
    
    The reason is that the second parameter of timespec64_compare(), ts_delta,
    may be unnormalized because the delta is calculated with an open coded
    substraction which causes the comparison of tv_sec to yield the wrong
    result:
    
      wall_to_monotonic = { .tv_sec = -10, .tv_nsec =  900000000 }
      ts_delta          = { .tv_sec =  -9, .tv_nsec = -900000000 }
    
    That makes timespec64_compare() claim that wall_to_monotonic < ts_delta,
    but actually the result should be wall_to_monotonic > ts_delta.
    
    After normalization, the result of timespec64_compare() is correct because
    the tv_sec comparison is not longer misleading:
    
      wall_to_monotonic = { .tv_sec = -10, .tv_nsec =  900000000 }
      ts_delta          = { .tv_sec = -10, .tv_nsec =  100000000 }
    
    Use timespec64_sub() to ensure that ts_delta is normalized, which fixes the
    issue.

    USB: serial: cp210x: fix CP2105 GPIO registration
    
    commit 83b67041f3eaf33f98a075249aa7f4c7617c2f85 upstream.
    
    When generalising GPIO support and adding support for CP2102N, the GPIO
    registration for some CP2105 devices accidentally broke. Specifically,
    when all the pins of a port are in "modem" mode, and thus unavailable
    for GPIO use, the GPIO chip would now be registered without having
    initialised the number of GPIO lines. This would in turn be rejected by
    gpiolib and some errors messages would be printed (but importantly probe
    would still succeed).
    
    Fix this by initialising the number of GPIO lines before registering the
    GPIO chip.
    
    Note that as for the other device types, and as when all CP2105 pins are
    muxed for LED function, the GPIO chip is registered also when no pins
    are available for GPIO use.

    PCI/MSI: Mask MSI-X vectors only on success
    
    commit 83dbf898a2d45289be875deb580e93050ba67529 upstream.
    
    Masking all unused MSI-X entries is done to ensure that a crash kernel
    starts from a clean slate, which correponds to the reset state of the
    device as defined in the PCI-E specificion 3.0 and later:
    
     Vector Control for MSI-X Table Entries
     --------------------------------------
    
     "00: Mask bit:  When this bit is set, the function is prohibited from
                     sending a message using this MSI-X Table entry.
                     ...
                     This bit’s state after reset is 1 (entry is masked)."
    
    A Marvell NVME device fails to deliver MSI interrupts after trying to
    enable MSI-X interrupts due to that masking. It seems to take the MSI-X
    mask bits into account even when MSI-X is disabled.
    
    While not specification compliant, this can be cured by moving the masking
    into the success path, so that the MSI-X table entries stay in device reset
    state when the MSI-X setup fails.

    commit 94185adbfad56815c2c8401e16d81bdb74a79201 upstream.
    
    PCI_MSIX_FLAGS_MASKALL is set in the MSI-X control register at MSI-X
    interrupt setup time. It's cleared on success, but the error handling path
    only clears the PCI_MSIX_FLAGS_ENABLE bit.
    
    That's incorrect as the reset state of the PCI_MSIX_FLAGS_MASKALL bit is
    zero. That can be observed via lspci:

    Clear the bit in the error path to restore the reset state.

    net/packet: rx_owner_map depends on pg_vec
    
    [ Upstream commit ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 ]
    
    Packet sockets may switch ring versions. Avoid misinterpreting state
    between versions, whose fields share a union. rx_owner_map is only
    allocated with a packet ring (pg_vec) and both are swapped together.
    If pg_vec is NULL, meaning no packet ring was allocated, then neither
    was rx_owner_map. And the field may be old state from a tpacket_v3.

    netdevsim: Zero-initialize memory for new map's value in function nsim_bpf_map_alloc
    
    [ Upstream commit 481221775d53d6215a6e5e9ce1cce6d2b4ab9a46 ]
    
    Zero-initialize memory for new map's value in function nsim_bpf_map_alloc
    since it may cause a potential kernel information leak issue, as follows:
    1. nsim_bpf_map_alloc calls nsim_map_alloc_elem to allocate elements for
    a new map.
    2. nsim_map_alloc_elem uses kmalloc to allocate map's value, but doesn't
    zero it.
    3. A user application can use IOCTL BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM to get specific
    element's information in the map.
    4. The kernel function map_lookup_elem will call bpf_map_copy_value to get
    the information allocated at step-2, then use copy_to_user to copy to the
    user buffer.
    This can only leak information for an array map.

    ixgbe: set X550 MDIO speed before talking to PHY
    
    [ Upstream commit bf0a375055bd1afbbf02a0ef45f7655da7b71317 ]
    
    The MDIO bus speed must be initialized before talking to the PHY the first
    time in order to avoid talking to it using a speed that the PHY doesn't
    support.
    
    This fixes HW initialization error -17 (IXGBE_ERR_PHY_ADDR_INVALID) on
    Denverton CPUs (a.k.a. the Atom C3000 family) on ports with a 10Gb network
    plugged in. On those devices, HLREG0[MDCSPD] resets to 1, which combined
    with the 10Gb network results in a 24MHz MDIO speed, which is apparently
    too fast for the connected PHY. PHY register reads over MDIO bus return
    garbage, leading to initialization failure.
    
    Reproduced with Linux kernel 4.19 and 5.15-rc7. Can be reproduced using
    the following setup:
    
    * Use an Atom C3000 family system with at least one X552 LAN on the SoC
    * Disable PXE or other BIOS network initialization if possible
      (the interface must not be initialized before Linux boots)
    * Connect a live 10Gb Ethernet cable to an X550 port
    * Power cycle (not reset, doesn't always work) the system and boot Linux
    * Observe: ixgbe interfaces w/ 10GbE cables plugged in fail with error -17

    igbvf: fix double free in `igbvf_probe`
    
    [ Upstream commit b6d335a60dc624c0d279333b22c737faa765b028 ]
    
    In `igbvf_probe`, if register_netdev() fails, the program will go to
    label err_hw_init, and then to label err_ioremap. In free_netdev() which
    is just below label err_ioremap, there is `list_for_each_entry_safe` and
    `netif_napi_del` which aims to delete all entries in `dev->napi_list`.
    The program has added an entry `adapter->rx_ring->napi` which is added by
    `netif_napi_add` in igbvf_alloc_queues(). However, adapter->rx_ring has
    been freed below label err_hw_init. So this a UAF.
    
    In terms of how to patch the problem, we can refer to igbvf_remove() and
    delete the entry before `adapter->rx_ring`.

    soc/tegra: fuse: Fix bitwise vs. logical OR warning
    
    [ Upstream commit a7083763619f7485ccdade160deb81737cf2732f ]
    
    A new warning in clang points out two instances where boolean
    expressions are being used with a bitwise OR instead of logical OR:
    
    drivers/soc/tegra/fuse/speedo-tegra20.c:72:9: warning: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]

    drivers/soc/tegra/fuse/speedo-tegra20.c:72:9: note: cast one or both operands to int to silence this warning
    drivers/soc/tegra/fuse/speedo-tegra20.c:87:9: warning: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
                    reg = tegra_fuse_read_spare(i) |

    drivers/soc/tegra/fuse/speedo-tegra20.c:87:9: note: cast one or both operands to int to silence this warning
    2 warnings generated.
    
    The motivation for the warning is that logical operations short circuit
    while bitwise operations do not.
    
    In this instance, tegra_fuse_read_spare() is not semantically returning
    a boolean, it is returning a bit value. Use u32 for its return type so
    that it can be used with either bitwise or boolean operators without any
    warnings.

    mac80211: track only QoS data frames for admission control
    
    [ Upstream commit d5e568c3a4ec2ddd23e7dc5ad5b0c64e4f22981a ]
    
    For admission control, obviously all of that only works for
    QoS data frames, otherwise we cannot even access the QoS
    field in the header.
    
    Syzbot reported (see below) an uninitialized value here due
    to a status of a non-QoS nullfunc packet, which isn't even
    long enough to contain the QoS header.
    
    Fix this to only do anything for QoS data packets.

    x86/sme: Explicitly map new EFI memmap table as encrypted
    
    commit 1ff2fc02862d52e18fd3daabcfe840ec27e920a8 upstream.
    
    Reserving memory using efi_mem_reserve() calls into the x86
    efi_arch_mem_reserve() function. This function will insert a new EFI
    memory descriptor into the EFI memory map representing the area of
    memory to be reserved and marking it as EFI runtime memory. As part
    of adding this new entry, a new EFI memory map is allocated and mapped.
    The mapping is where a problem can occur. This new memory map is mapped
    using early_memremap() and generally mapped encrypted, unless the new
    memory for the mapping happens to come from an area of memory that is
    marked as EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_DATA memory. In this case, the new memory will
    be mapped unencrypted. However, during replacement of the old memory map,
    efi_mem_type() is disabled, so the new memory map will now be long-term
    mapped encrypted (in efi.memmap), resulting in the map containing invalid
    data and causing the kernel boot to crash.
    
    Since it is known that the area will be mapped encrypted going forward,
    explicitly map the new memory map as encrypted using early_memremap_prot().

    x86: Make ARCH_USE_MEMREMAP_PROT a generic Kconfig symbol
    
    commit ce9084ba0d1d8030adee7038ace32f8d9d423d0f upstream.
    
    Turn ARCH_USE_MEMREMAP_PROT into a generic Kconfig symbol, and fix the
    dependency expression to reflect that AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT depends on it,
    instead of the other way around. This will permit ARCH_USE_MEMREMAP_PROT
    to be selected by other architectures.
    
    Note that the encryption related early memremap routines in
    arch/x86/mm/ioremap.c cannot be built for 32-bit x86 without triggering
    the following warning:
    
         arch/x86//mm/ioremap.c: In function 'early_memremap_encrypted':
      >> arch/x86/include/asm/pgtable_types.h:193:27: warning: conversion from
                         'long long unsigned int' to 'long unsigned int' changes
                         value from '9223372036854776163' to '355' [-Woverflow]
          #define __PAGE_KERNEL_ENC (__PAGE_KERNEL | _PAGE_ENC)
                                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         arch/x86//mm/ioremap.c:713:46: note: in expansion of macro '__PAGE_KERNEL_ENC'
           return early_memremap_prot(phys_addr, size, __PAGE_KERNEL_ENC);
    
    which essentially means they are 64-bit only anyway. However, we cannot
    make them dependent on CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_MEM_ENCRYPT, since that is always
    defined, even for i386 (and changing that results in a slew of build errors)
    
    So instead, build those routines only if CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT is
    defined.

    nfsd: fix use-after-free due to delegation race
    
    commit 548ec0805c399c65ed66c6641be467f717833ab5 upstream.
    
    A delegation break could arrive as soon as we've called vfs_setlease.  A
    delegation break runs a callback which immediately (in
    nfsd4_cb_recall_prepare) adds the delegation to del_recall_lru.  If we
    then exit nfs4_set_delegation without hashing the delegation, it will be
    freed as soon as the callback is done with it, without ever being
    removed from del_recall_lru.
    
    Symptoms show up later as use-after-free or list corruption warnings,
    usually in the laundromat thread.
    
    I suspect aba2072f4523 "nfsd: grant read delegations to clients holding
    writes" made this bug easier to hit, but I looked as far back as v3.0
    and it looks to me it already had the same problem.  So I'm not sure
    where the bug was introduced; it may have been there from the beginning.

    audit: improve robustness of the audit queue handling
    
    commit f4b3ee3c85551d2d343a3ba159304066523f730f upstream.
    
    If the audit daemon were ever to get stuck in a stopped state the
    kernel's kauditd_thread() could get blocked attempting to send audit
    records to the userspace audit daemon.  With the kernel thread
    blocked it is possible that the audit queue could grow unbounded as
    certain audit record generating events must be exempt from the queue
    limits else the system enter a deadlock state.
    
    This patch resolves this problem by lowering the kernel thread's
    socket sending timeout from MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT to HZ/10 and tweaks
    the kauditd_send_queue() function to better manage the various audit
    queues when connection problems occur between the kernel and the
    audit daemon.  With this patch, the backlog may temporarily grow
    beyond the defined limits when the audit daemon is stopped and the
    system is under heavy audit pressure, but kauditd_thread() will
    continue to make progress and drain the queues as it would for other
    connection problems.  For example, with the audit daemon put into a
    stopped state and the system configured to audit every syscall it
    was still possible to shutdown the system without a kernel panic,
    deadlock, etc.; granted, the system was slow to shutdown but that is
    to be expected given the extreme pressure of recording every syscall.
    
    The timeout value of HZ/10 was chosen primarily through
    experimentation and this developer's "gut feeling".  There is likely
    no one perfect value, but as this scenario is limited in scope (root
    privileges would be needed to send SIGSTOP to the audit daemon), it
    is likely not worth exposing this as a tunable at present.  This can
    always be done at a later date if it proves necessary.

    mac80211: send ADDBA requests using the tid/queue of the aggregation session
    
    commit 1fe98f5690c4219d419ea9cc190f94b3401cf324 upstream.
    
    Sending them out on a different queue can cause a race condition where a
    number of packets in the queue may be discarded by the receiver, because
    the ADDBA request is sent too early.
    This affects any driver with software A-MPDU setup which does not allocate
    packet seqno in hardware on tx, regardless of whether iTXQ is used or not.
    The only driver I've seen that explicitly deals with this issue internally
    is mwl8k.

    The reason is elts->pages[i] is alloced by get_zeroed_page.
    and kmemleak will not scan the area alloced by get_zeroed_page.
    The address stored in elts->pages will be regarded as leaked.
    
    That is, the elts->pages[i] will have pointers loaded onto it as well, and
    without telling kmemleak about it, those pointers will look like memory
    without a reference.
    
    To fix this, call kmemleak_alloc to tell kmemleak to scan elts->pages[i]

    net: netlink: af_netlink: Prevent empty skb by adding a check on len.
    
    [ Upstream commit f123cffdd8fe8ea6c7fded4b88516a42798797d0 ]
    
    Adding a check on len parameter to avoid empty skb. This prevents a
    division error in netem_enqueue function which is caused when skb->len=0
    and skb->data_len=0 in the randomized corruption step as shown below.
    
    skb->data[prandom_u32() % skb_headlen(skb)] ^= 1<<(prandom_u32() % 8);

    i2c: rk3x: Handle a spurious start completion interrupt flag
    
    [ Upstream commit 02fe0fbd8a21e183687925c3a266ae27dda9840f ]
    
    In a typical read transfer, start completion flag is being set after
    read finishes (notice ipd bit 4 being set):
    
    trasnfer poll=0
    i2c start
    rk3x-i2c fdd40000.i2c: IRQ: state 1, ipd: 10
    i2c read

    i2c stop

    This causes I2C transfer being aborted in polled mode from a stop completion
    handler:
    
    trasnfer poll=1
    i2c start
    rk3x-i2c fdd40000.i2c: IRQ: state 1, ipd: 10
    i2c read
    rk3x-i2c fdd40000.i2c: IRQ: state 2, ipd: 0
    rk3x-i2c fdd40000.i2c: IRQ: state 2, ipd: 1b
    i2c stop
    rk3x-i2c fdd40000.i2c: IRQ: state 4, ipd: 13
    i2c stop
    rk3x-i2c fdd40000.i2c: unexpected irq in STOP: 0x10
    
    Clearing the START flag after read fixes the issue without any obvious
    side effects.
    
    This issue was dicovered on RK3566 when adding support for powering
    off the RK817 PMIC.

    net/mlx4_en: Update reported link modes for 1/10G
    
    [ Upstream commit 2191b1dfef7d45f44b5008d2148676d9f2c82874 ]
    
    When link modes were initially added in commit 2c762679435dc
    ("net/mlx4_en: Use PTYS register to query ethtool settings") and
    later updated for the new ethtool API in commit 3d8f7cc78d0eb
    ("net: mlx4: use new ETHTOOL_G/SSETTINGS API") the only 1/10G non-baseT
    link modes configured were 1000baseKX, 10000baseKX4 and 10000baseKR.
    It looks like these got picked to represent other modes since nothing
    better was available.
    
    Switch to using more specific link modes added in commit 5711a98221443
    ("net: ethtool: add support for 1000BaseX and missing 10G link modes").

    drm/msm/dsi: set default num_data_lanes
    
    [ Upstream commit cd92cc187c053ab010a1570e2d61d68394a5c725 ]
    
    If "data_lanes" property of the dsi output endpoint is missing in
    the DT, num_data_lanes would be 0 by default, which could cause
    dsi_host_attach() to fail if dsi->lanes is set to a non-zero value
    by the bridge driver.
    
    According to the binding document of msm dsi controller, the
    input/output endpoint of the controller is expected to have 4 lanes.
    So let's set num_data_lanes to 4 by default.

    stable: clamp SUBLEVEL in 4.19
    
    In a few months, SUBLEVEL will overflow, and some userspace may start
    treating 4.19.256 as 4.20. While out of tree modules have different ways
    of extracting the version number (and we're generally ok with breaking
    them), we do care about breaking userspace and it would appear that this
    overflow might do just that.
    
    Our rules around userspace ABI in the stable kernel are pretty simple:
    we don't break it. Thus, while userspace may be checking major/minor, it
    shouldn't be doing anything with sublevel.
    
    This patch applies a big band-aid to the 4.19 kernel in the form of
    clamping the sublevel to 255.
    
    The clamp is done for the purpose of LINUX_VERSION_CODE only, and
    extracting the version number from the Makefile or "make kernelversion"
    will continue to work as intended.
    
    We might need to do it later in newer trees, but maybe we'll have a
    better solution by then, so I'm ignoring that problem for now.
