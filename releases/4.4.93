    x86/alternatives: Fix alt_max_short macro to really be a max()
    
    commit 6b32c126d33d5cb379bca280ab8acedc1ca978ff upstream.
    
    The alt_max_short() macro in asm/alternative.h does not work as
    intended, leading to nasty bugs. E.g. alt_max_short("1", "3")
    evaluates to 3, but alt_max_short("3", "1") evaluates to 1 -- not
    exactly the maximum of 1 and 3.
    
    In fact, I had to learn it the hard way by crashing my kernel in not
    so funny ways by attempting to make use of the ALTENATIVE_2 macro
    with alternatives where the first one was larger than the second
    one.
    
    According to [1] and commit dbe4058a6a44 ("x86/alternatives: Fix
    ALTERNATIVE_2 padding generation properly") the right handed side
    should read "-(-(a < b))" not "-(-(a - b))". Fix that, to make the
    macro work as intended.
    
    While at it, fix up the comments regarding the additional "-", too.
    It's not about gas' usage of s32 but brain dead logic of having a
    "true" value of -1 for the < operator ... *sigh*
    
    Btw., the one in asm/alternative-asm.h is correct. And, apparently,
    all current users of ALTERNATIVE_2() pass same sized alternatives,
    avoiding to hit the bug.

    when some driver is un-bound and then bound again.
    For example, this happens with FunctionFS driver when "ffs-test"
    test application is run several times in a row.
    
    If the driver has empty manufacturer ID string in initial static data,
    it is then replaced with generated string. After driver unbinding
    the generated string is freed, but the driver data still keep that
    pointer. And if the driver is then bound again, that pointer
    is re-used for string emptiness check.
    
    The fix is to clean up the driver string data upon its unbinding
    to drop the pointer to freed memory.

    ALSA: line6: Fix leftover URB at error-path during probe
    
    commit c95072b3d88fac4be295815f2b67df366c0c297f upstream.
    
    While line6_probe() may kick off URB for a control MIDI endpoint, the
    function doesn't clean up it properly at its error path.  This results
    in a leftover URB action that is eventually triggered later and causes
    an Oops like:

    Since the whole clean-up procedure is done in line6_disconnect()
    callback, we can simply call it in the error path instead of
    open-coding the whole again.  It'll fix such an issue automagically.
    
    The bug was spotted by syzkaller.

    ALSA: seq: Fix copy_from_user() call inside lock
    
    commit 5803b023881857db32ffefa0d269c90280a67ee0 upstream.
    
    The event handler in the virmidi sequencer code takes a read-lock for
    the linked list traverse, while it's calling snd_seq_dump_var_event()
    in the loop.  The latter function may expand the user-space data
    depending on the event type.  It eventually invokes copy_from_user(),
    which might be a potential dead-lock.
    
    The sequencer core guarantees that the user-space data is passed only
    with atomic=0 argument, but snd_virmidi_dev_receive_event() ignores it
    and always takes read-lock().  For avoiding the problem above, this
    patch introduces rwsem for non-atomic case, while keeping rwlock for
    atomic case.
    
    Also while we're at it: the superfluous irq flags is dropped in
    snd_virmidi_input_open().

    ALSA: seq: Fix use-after-free at creating a port
    
    commit 71105998845fb012937332fe2e806d443c09e026 upstream.
    
    There is a potential race window opened at creating and deleting a
    port via ioctl, as spotted by fuzzing.  snd_seq_create_port() creates
    a port object and returns its pointer, but it doesn't take the
    refcount, thus it can be deleted immediately by another thread.
    Meanwhile, snd_seq_ioctl_create_port() still calls the function
    snd_seq_system_client_ev_port_start() with the created port object
    that is being deleted, and this triggers use-after-free like:

    We may fix this in a few different ways, and in this patch, it's fixed
    simply by taking the refcount properly at snd_seq_create_port() and
    letting the caller unref the object after use.  Also, there is another
    potential use-after-free by sprintf() call in snd_seq_create_port(),
    and this is moved inside the lock.
    
    This fix covers CVE-2017-15265.

    Actually such a URB is killed properly at disconnection when the

    Also introduce a new flag, disconnected, to struct usb_mixer_interface
    for not performing the disconnection procedure twice.

    usb: renesas_usbhs: Fix DMAC sequence for receiving zero-length packet
    
    commit 29c7f3e68eec4ae94d85ad7b5dfdafdb8089f513 upstream.
    
    The DREQE bit of the DnFIFOSEL should be set to 1 after the DE bit of
    USB-DMAC on R-Car SoCs is set to 1 after the USB-DMAC received a
    zero-length packet. Otherwise, a transfer completion interruption
    of USB-DMAC doesn't happen. Even if the driver changes the sequence,
    normal operations (transmit/receive without zero-length packet) will
    not cause any side-effects. So, this patch fixes the sequence anyway.

    KVM: nVMX: fix guest CR4 loading when emulating L2 to L1 exit
    
    commit 8eb3f87d903168bdbd1222776a6b1e281f50513e upstream.
    
    When KVM emulates an exit from L2 to L1, it loads L1 CR4 into the
    guest CR4. Before this CR4 loading, the guest CR4 refers to L2
    CR4. Because these two CR4's are in different levels of guest, we
    should vmx_set_cr4() rather than kvm_set_cr4() here. The latter, which
    is used to handle guest writes to its CR4, checks the guest change to
    CR4 and may fail if the change is invalid.
    
    The failure may cause trouble. Consider we start
      a L1 guest with non-zero L1 PCID in use,
         (i.e. L1 CR4.PCIDE == 1 && L1 CR3.PCID != 0)
    and
      a L2 guest with L2 PCID disabled,
         (i.e. L2 CR4.PCIDE == 0)
    and following events may happen:
    
    1. If kvm_set_cr4() is used in load_vmcs12_host_state() to load L1 CR4
       into guest CR4 (in VMCS01) for L2 to L1 exit, it will fail because
       of PCID check. As a result, the guest CR4 recorded in L0 KVM (i.e.
       vcpu->arch.cr4) is left to the value of L2 CR4.
    
    2. Later, if L1 attempts to change its CR4, e.g., clearing VMXE bit,
       kvm_set_cr4() in L0 KVM will think L1 also wants to enable PCID,
       because the wrong L2 CR4 is used by L0 KVM as L1 CR4. As L1
       CR3.PCID != 0, L0 KVM will inject GP to L1 guest.

    HID: usbhid: fix out-of-bounds bug
    
    commit f043bfc98c193c284e2cd768fefabe18ac2fed9b upstream.
    
    The hid descriptor identifies the length and type of subordinate
    descriptors for a device. If the received hid descriptor is smaller than
    the size of the struct hid_descriptor, it is possible to cause
    out-of-bounds.
    
    In addition, if bNumDescriptors of the hid descriptor have an incorrect
    value, this can also cause out-of-bounds while approaching hdesc->desc[n].
    
    So check the size of hid descriptor and bNumDescriptors.

    dmaengine: edma: Align the memcpy acnt array size with the transfer
    
    commit 87a2f622cc6446c7d09ac655b7b9b04886f16a4c upstream.
    
    Memory to Memory transfers does not have any special alignment needs
    regarding to acnt array size, but if one of the areas are in memory mapped
    regions (like PCIe memory), we need to make sure that the acnt array size
    is aligned with the mem copy parameters.
    
    Before "dmaengine: edma: Optimize memcpy operation" change the memcpy was set
    up in a different way: acnt == number of bytes in a word based on
    __ffs((src | dest | len), bcnt and ccnt for looping the necessary number of
    words to comlete the trasnfer.
    
    Instead of reverting the commit we can fix it to make sure that the ACNT size
    is aligned to the traswnfer.

    MIPS: math-emu: Remove pr_err() calls from fpu_emu()
    
    commit ca8eb05b5f332a9e1ab3e2ece498d49f4d683470 upstream.
    
    The FPU emulator includes 2 calls to pr_err() which are triggered by
    invalid instruction encodings for MIPSr6 cmp.cond.fmt instructions.
    These cases are not kernel errors, merely invalid instructions which are
    already handled by delivering a SIGILL which will provide notification
    that something failed in cases where that makes sense.
    
    In cases where that SIGILL is somewhat expected & being handled, for
    example when crashme happens to generate one of the affected bad
    encodings, the message is printed with no useful context about what
    triggered it & spams the kernel log for no good reason.
    
    Remove the pr_err() calls to make crashme run silently & treat the bad
    encodings the same way we do others, with a SIGILL & no further kernel
    log output.

    The dummy-hcd driver calls the gadget driver's disconnect callback
    under the wrong conditions.  It should invoke the callback when Vbus
    power is turned off, but instead it does so when the D+ pullup is
    turned off.
    
    This can cause a deadlock in the composite core when a gadget driver
    is unregistered:

    rcu: Allow for page faults in NMI handlers
    
    commit 28585a832602747cbfa88ad8934013177a3aae38 upstream.
    
    A number of architecture invoke rcu_irq_enter() on exception entry in
    order to allow RCU read-side critical sections in the exception handler
    when the exception is from an idle or nohz_full CPU.  This works, at
    least unless the exception happens in an NMI handler.  In that case,
    rcu_nmi_enter() would already have exited the extended quiescent state,
    which would mean that rcu_irq_enter() would (incorrectly) cause RCU
    to think that it is again in an extended quiescent state.  This will
    in turn result in lockdep splats in response to later RCU read-side
    critical sections.
    
    This commit therefore causes rcu_irq_enter() and rcu_irq_exit() to
    take no action if there is an rcu_nmi_enter() in effect, thus avoiding
    the unscheduled return to RCU quiescent state.  This in turn should
    make the kernel safe for on-demand RCU voyeurism.

    iwlwifi: mvm: use IWL_HCMD_NOCOPY for MCAST_FILTER_CMD
    
    commit 97bce57bd7f96e1218751996f549a6e61f18cc8c upstream.
    
    The MCAST_FILTER_CMD can get quite large when we have many mcast
    addresses to set (we support up to 255).  So the command should be
    send as NOCOPY to prevent a warning caused by too-long commands:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9700 at /root/iwlwifi/stack-dev/drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/pcie/tx.c:1550 iwl_pcie_enqueue_hcmd+0x8c7/0xb40 [iwlwifi]
    Command MCAST_FILTER_CMD (0x1d0) is too large (328 bytes)

    nl80211: Define policy for packet pattern attributes
    
    commit ad670233c9e1d5feb365d870e30083ef1b889177 upstream.
    
    Define a policy for packet pattern attributes in order to fix a
    potential read over the end of the buffer during nla_get_u32()
    of the NL80211_PKTPAT_OFFSET attribute.
    
    Note that the data there can always be read due to SKB allocation
    (with alignment and struct skb_shared_info at the end), but the
    data might be uninitialized. This could be used to leak some data
    from uninitialized vmalloc() memory, but most drivers don't allow
    an offset (so you'd just get -EINVAL if the data is non-zero) or
    just allow it with a fixed value - 100 or 128 bytes, so anything
    above that would get -EINVAL. With brcmfmac the limit is 1500 so
    (at least) one byte could be obtained.

    CIFS: Reconnect expired SMB sessions
    
    commit 511c54a2f69195b28afb9dd119f03787b1625bb4 upstream.
    
    According to the MS-SMB2 spec (3.2.5.1.6) once the client receives
    STATUS_NETWORK_SESSION_EXPIRED error code from a server it should
    reconnect the current SMB session. Currently the client doesn't do
    that. This can result in subsequent client requests failing by
    the server. The patch adds an additional logic to the demultiplex
    thread to identify expired sessions and reconnect them.

    ext4: in ext4_seek_{hole,data}, return -ENXIO for negative offsets
    
    commit 1bd8d6cd3e413d64e543ec3e69ff43e75a1cf1ea upstream.
    
    In the ext4 implementations of SEEK_HOLE and SEEK_DATA, make sure we
    return -ENXIO for negative offsets instead of banging around inside
    the extent code and returning -EFSCORRUPTED.

    brcmfmac: add length check in brcmf_cfg80211_escan_handler()
    
    commit 17df6453d4be17910456e99c5a85025aa1b7a246 upstream.
    
    Upon handling the firmware notification for scans the length was
    checked properly and may result in corrupting kernel heap memory
    due to buffer overruns. This fix addresses CVE-2017-0786.
