    iov_iter: optimize page_copy_sane()
    
    commit 6daef95b8c914866a46247232a048447fff97279 upstream.
    
    Avoid cache line miss dereferencing struct page if we can.
    
    page_copy_sane() mostly deals with order-0 pages.
    
    Extra cache line miss is visible on TCP recvmsg() calls dealing
    with GRO packets (typically 45 page frags are attached to one skb).
    
    Bringing the 45 struct pages into cpu cache while copying the data
    is not free, since the freeing of the skb (and associated
    page frags put_page()) can happen after cache lines have been evicted.

    KVM: x86: Skip EFER vs. guest CPUID checks for host-initiated writes
    
    commit 11988499e62b310f3bf6f6d0a807a06d3f9ccc96 upstream.
    
    KVM allows userspace to violate consistency checks related to the
    guest's CPUID model to some degree.  Generally speaking, userspace has
    carte blanche when it comes to guest state so long as jamming invalid
    state won't negatively affect the host.
    
    Currently this is seems to be a non-issue as most of the interesting
    EFER checks are missing, e.g. NX and LME, but those will be added
    shortly.  Proactively exempt userspace from the CPUID checks so as not
    to break userspace.
    
    Note, the efer_reserved_bits check still applies to userspace writes as
    that mask reflects the host's capabilities, e.g. KVM shouldn't allow a
    guest to run with NX=1 if it has been disabled in the host.

    ext4: fix data corruption caused by overlapping unaligned and aligned IO
    
    commit 57a0da28ced8707cb9f79f071a016b9d005caf5a upstream.
    
    Unaligned AIO must be serialized because the zeroing of partial blocks
    of unaligned AIO can result in data corruption in case it's overlapping
    another in flight IO.
    
    Currently we wait for all unwritten extents before we submit unaligned
    AIO which protects data in case of unaligned AIO is following overlapping
    IO. However if a unaligned AIO is followed by overlapping aligned AIO we
    can still end up corrupting data.
    
    To fix this, we must make sure that the unaligned AIO is the only IO in
    flight by waiting for unwritten extents conversion not just before the
    IO submission, but right after it as well.
    
    This problem can be reproduced by xfstest generic/538

    fs/writeback.c: use rcu_barrier() to wait for inflight wb switches going into workqueue when umount

    crypto: ccm - fix incompatibility between "ccm" and "ccm_base"
    
    commit 6a1faa4a43f5fabf9cbeaa742d916e7b5e73120f upstream.
    
    CCM instances can be created by either the "ccm" template, which only
    allows choosing the block cipher, e.g. "ccm(aes)"; or by "ccm_base",
    which allows choosing the ctr and cbcmac implementations, e.g.
    "ccm_base(ctr(aes-generic),cbcmac(aes-generic))".
    
    However, a "ccm_base" instance prevents a "ccm" instance from being
    registered using the same implementations.  Nor will the instance be
    found by lookups of "ccm".  This can be used as a denial of service.
    Moreover, "ccm_base" instances are never tested by the crypto
    self-tests, even if there are compatible "ccm" tests.
    
    The root cause of these problems is that instances of the two templates
    use different cra_names.  Therefore, fix these problems by making
    "ccm_base" instances set the same cra_name as "ccm" instances, e.g.
    "ccm(aes)" instead of "ccm_base(ctr(aes-generic),cbcmac(aes-generic))".
    
    This requires extracting the block cipher name from the name of the ctr
    and cbcmac algorithms.  It also requires starting to verify that the
    algorithms are really ctr and cbcmac using the same block cipher, not
    something else entirely.  But it would be bizarre if anyone were
    actually using non-ccm-compatible algorithms with ccm_base, so this
    shouldn't break anyone in practice.

    crypto: salsa20 - don't access already-freed walk.iv
    
    commit edaf28e996af69222b2cb40455dbb5459c2b875a upstream.
    
    If the user-provided IV needs to be aligned to the algorithm's
    alignmask, then skcipher_walk_virt() copies the IV into a new aligned
    buffer walk.iv.  But skcipher_walk_virt() can fail afterwards, and then
    if the caller unconditionally accesses walk.iv, it's a use-after-free.
    
    salsa20-generic doesn't set an alignmask, so currently it isn't affected
    by this despite unconditionally accessing walk.iv.  However this is more
    subtle than desired, and it was actually broken prior to the alignmask
    being removed by commit b62b3db76f73 ("crypto: salsa20-generic - cleanup
    and convert to skcipher API").
    
    Since salsa20-generic does not update the IV and does not need any IV
    alignment, update it to use req->iv instead of walk.iv.

    starting with 0, for each new block of message data returned using the
    middle transaction.
    
    Here, the 'blocknum' is data[0] which always starts from zero(0) and
    'ssif_info->multi_pos' starts from 1.
    So, we need to add +1 to blocknum while comparing with multi_pos.

    bcache: never set KEY_PTRS of journal key to 0 in journal_reclaim()
    
    commit 1bee2addc0c8470c8aaa65ef0599eeae96dd88bc upstream.
    
    In journal_reclaim() ja->cur_idx of each cache will be update to
    reclaim available journal buckets. Variable 'int n' is used to count how
    many cache is successfully reclaimed, then n is set to c->journal.key
    by SET_KEY_PTRS(). Later in journal_write_unlocked(), a for_each_cache()
    loop will write the jset data onto each cache.
    
    The problem is, if all jouranl buckets on each cache is full, the
    following code in journal_reclaim(),
    
    529 for_each_cache(ca, c, iter) {
    530       struct journal_device *ja = &ca->journal;
    531       unsigned int next = (ja->cur_idx + 1) % ca->sb.njournal_buckets;
    532
    533       /* No space available on this device */
    534       if (next == ja->discard_idx)
    535               continue;
    536
    537       ja->cur_idx = next;
    538       k->ptr[n++] = MAKE_PTR(0,
    539                         bucket_to_sector(c, ca->sb.d[ja->cur_idx]),
    540                         ca->sb.nr_this_dev);
    541 }
    542
    543 bkey_init(k);
    544 SET_KEY_PTRS(k, n);
    
    If there is no available bucket to reclaim, the if() condition at line
    534 will always true, and n remains 0. Then at line 544, SET_KEY_PTRS()
    will set KEY_PTRS field of c->journal.key to 0.
    
    Setting KEY_PTRS field of c->journal.key to 0 is wrong. Because in
    journal_write_unlocked() the journal data is written in following loop,
    
    649     for (i = 0; i < KEY_PTRS(k); i++) {
    650-671         submit journal data to cache device
    672     }
    
    If KEY_PTRS field is set to 0 in jouranl_reclaim(), the journal data
    won't be written to cache device here. If system crahed or rebooted
    before bkeys of the lost journal entries written into btree nodes, data
    corruption will be reported during bcache reload after rebooting the
    system.
    
    Indeed there is only one cache in a cache set, there is no need to set
    KEY_PTRS field in journal_reclaim() at all. But in order to keep the
    for_each_cache() logic consistent for now, this patch fixes the above
    problem by not setting 0 KEY_PTRS of journal key, if there is no bucket
    available to reclaim.

    bcache: fix a race between cache register and cacheset unregister
    
    commit a4b732a248d12cbdb46999daf0bf288c011335eb upstream.
    
    There is a race between cache device register and cache set unregister.
    For an already registered cache device, register_bcache will call
    bch_is_open to iterate through all cachesets and check every cache
    there. The race occurs if cache_set_free executes at the same time and
    clears the caches right before ca is dereferenced in bch_is_open_cache.
    To close the race, let's make sure the clean up work is protected by
    the bch_register_lock as well.
    
    This issue can be reproduced as follows,
    while true; do echo /dev/XXX> /sys/fs/bcache/register ; done&
    while true; do echo 1> /sys/block/XXX/bcache/set/unregister ; done &
    
    and results in the following oops,

    Btrfs: do not start a transaction at iterate_extent_inodes()
    
    commit bfc61c36260ca990937539cd648ede3cd749bc10 upstream.
    
    When finding out which inodes have references on a particular extent, done
    by backref.c:iterate_extent_inodes(), from the BTRFS_IOC_LOGICAL_INO (both
    v1 and v2) ioctl and from scrub we use the transaction join API to grab a
    reference on the currently running transaction, since in order to give
    accurate results we need to inspect the delayed references of the currently
    running transaction.
    
    However, if there is currently no running transaction, the join operation
    will create a new transaction. This is inefficient as the transaction will
    eventually be committed, doing unnecessary IO and introducing a potential
    point of failure that will lead to a transaction abort due to -ENOSPC, as
    recently reported [1].
    
    That's because the join, creates the transaction but does not reserve any
    space, so when attempting to update the root item of the root passed to
    btrfs_join_transaction(), during the transaction commit, we can end up
    failling with -ENOSPC. Users of a join operation are supposed to actually
    do some filesystem changes and reserve space by some means, which is not
    the case of iterate_extent_inodes(), it is a read-only operation for all
    contextes from which it is called.
    
    The reported [1] -ENOSPC failure stack trace is the following:

    Btrfs: do not start a transaction during fiemap
    
    commit 03628cdbc64db6262e50d0357960a4e9562676a1 upstream.
    
    During fiemap, for regular extents (non inline) we need to check if they
    are shared and if they are, set the shared bit. Checking if an extent is
    shared requires checking the delayed references of the currently running
    transaction, since some reference might have not yet hit the extent tree
    and be only in the in-memory delayed references.
    
    However we were using a transaction join for this, which creates a new
    transaction when there is no transaction currently running. That means
    that two more potential failures can happen: creating the transaction and
    committing it. Further, if no write activity is currently happening in the
    system, and fiemap calls keep being done, we end up creating and
    committing transactions that do nothing.
    
    In some extreme cases this can result in the commit of the transaction
    created by fiemap to fail with ENOSPC when updating the root item of a
    subvolume tree because a join does not reserve any space, leading to a
    trace like the following:

    Since fiemap (and btrfs_check_shared()) is a read-only operation, do not do
    a transaction join to avoid the overhead of creating a new transaction (if
    there is currently no running transaction) and introducing a potential
    point of failure when the new transaction gets committed, instead use a
    transaction attach to grab a handle for the currently running transaction
    if any.

    ext4: make sanity check in mballoc more strict

    The sanity check in mb_find_extent() only checked that returned extent
    does not extend past blocksize * 8, however it should not extend past
    EXT4_CLUSTERS_PER_GROUP(sb). This can happen when clusters_per_group <
    blocksize * 8 and the tail of the bitmap is not properly filled by 1s
    which happened e.g. when ancient kernels have grown the filesystem.

    jbd2: check superblock mapped prior to committing
    
    commit 742b06b5628f2cd23cb51a034cb54dc33c6162c5 upstream.
    
    We hit a BUG at fs/buffer.c:3057 if we detached the nbd device
    before unmounting ext4 filesystem.
    
    The typical chain of events leading to the BUG:
    jbd2_write_superblock
      submit_bh
        submit_bh_wbc
          BUG_ON(!buffer_mapped(bh));
    
    The block device is removed and all the pages are invalidated. JBD2
    was trying to write journal superblock to the block device which is
    no longer present.
    
    Fix this by checking the journal superblock's buffer head prior to
    submitting.

    The bug manifests on systemd systems with multiple vtcon devices:

      (S) dummy device
      # cat /sys/devices/virtual/vtconsole/vtcon1/name
      (M) frame buffer device
    
    There systemd runs 'loadkeys' tool in tapallel for each vtcon
    instance. This causes two parallel ioctl(KDSKBSENT) calls to
    race into adding the same entry into 'func_table' array at:
    
        drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c:vt_do_kdgkb_ioctl()
    
    The function has no locking around writes to 'func_table'.
    
    The simplest reproducer is to have initrams with the following
    init on a 8-CPU machine x86_64:
    
        #!/bin/sh
    
        loadkeys -q windowkeys ru4 &
        loadkeys -q windowkeys ru4 &
        loadkeys -q windowkeys ru4 &
        loadkeys -q windowkeys ru4 &
    
        loadkeys -q windowkeys ru4 &
        loadkeys -q windowkeys ru4 &
        loadkeys -q windowkeys ru4 &
        loadkeys -q windowkeys ru4 &
        wait
    
    The change adds lock on write path only. Reads are still racy.

    tty: vt.c: Fix TIOCL_BLANKSCREEN console blanking if blankinterval == 0
    
    commit 75ddbc1fb11efac87b611d48e9802f6fe2bb2163 upstream.
    
    Previously, in the userspace, it was possible to use the "setterm" command
    from util-linux to blank the VT console by default, using the following
    command.
    
    According to the man page,
    
    > The force option keeps the screen blank even if a key is pressed.
    
    It was implemented by calling TIOCL_BLANKSCREEN.
    
            case BLANKSCREEN:
                    ioctlarg = TIOCL_BLANKSCREEN;
                    if (ioctl(STDIN_FILENO, TIOCLINUX, &ioctlarg))
                            warn(_("cannot force blank"));
                    break;
    
    However, after Linux 4.12, this command ceased to work anymore, which is
    unexpected. By inspecting the kernel source, it shows that the issue was
    triggered by the side-effect from commit a4199f5eb809 ("tty: Disable
    default console blanking interval").
    
    The console blanking is implemented by function do_blank_screen() in vt.c:
    "blank_state" will be initialized to "blank_normal_wait" in con_init() if
    AND ONLY IF ("blankinterval" > 0). If "blankinterval" is 0, "blank_state"
    will be "blank_off" (== 0), and a call to do_blank_screen() will always
    abort, even if a forced blanking is required from the user by calling
    TIOCL_BLANKSCREEN, the console won't be blanked.
    
    This behavior is unexpected from a user's point-of-view, since it's not
    mentioned in any documentation. The setterm man page suggests it will
    always work, and the kernel comments in uapi/linux/tiocl.h says
    
    > /* keep screen blank even if a key is pressed */
    > #define TIOCL_BLANKSCREEN 14
    
    To fix it, we simply remove the "blank_state != blank_off" check, as
    pointed out by Nicolas Pitre, this check doesn't logically make sense
    and it's safe to remove.

    mtd: spi-nor: intel-spi: Avoid crossing 4K address boundary on read/write
    
    commit 2b75ebeea6f4937d4d05ec4982c471cef9a29b7f upstream.
    
    It was observed that reads crossing 4K address boundary are failing.
    
    This limitation is mentioned in Intel documents:
    
    Intel(R) 9 Series Chipset Family Platform Controller Hub (PCH) Datasheet:
    
    "5.26.3 Flash Access
    Program Register Access:
    * Program Register Accesses are not allowed to cross a 4 KB boundary..."
    
    Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface (eSPI)
    Interface Base Specification (for Client and Server Platforms):
    
    "5.1.4 Address
    For other memory transactions, the address may start or end at any byte
    boundary. However, the address and payload length combination must not
    cross the naturally aligned address boundary of the corresponding Maximum
    Payload Size. It must not cross a 4 KB address boundary."
    
    Avoid this by splitting an operation crossing the boundary into two
    operations.

    userfaultfd: use RCU to free the task struct when fork fails
    
    commit c3f3ce049f7d97cc7ec9c01cb51d9ec74e0f37c2 upstream.
    
    The task structure is freed while get_mem_cgroup_from_mm() holds
    rcu_read_lock() and dereferences mm->owner.
    
      get_mem_cgroup_from_mm()                failing fork()
      ----                                    ---
      task = mm->owner
                                              mm->owner = NULL;
                                              free(task)
      if (task) *task; /* use after free */
    
    The fix consists in freeing the task with RCU also in the fork failure
    case, exactly like it always happens for the regular exit(2) path.  That
    is enough to make the rcu_read_lock hold in get_mem_cgroup_from_mm()
    (left side above) effective to avoid a use after free when dereferencing
    the task structure.
    
    An alternate possible fix would be to defer the delivery of the
    userfaultfd contexts to the monitor until after fork() is guaranteed to
    succeed.  Such a change would require more changes because it would
    create a strict ordering dependency where the uffd methods would need to
    be called beyond the last potentially failing branch in order to be
    safe.  This solution as opposed only adds the dependency to common code
    to set mm->owner to NULL and to free the task struct that was pointed by
    mm->owner with RCU, if fork ends up failing.  The userfaultfd methods
    can still be called anywhere during the fork runtime and the monitor
    will keep discarding orphaned "mm" coming from failed forks in userland.
    
    This race condition couldn't trigger if CONFIG_MEMCG was set =n at build
    time.

    ocfs2: fix ocfs2 read inode data panic in ocfs2_iget
    
    commit e091eab028f9253eac5c04f9141bbc9d170acab3 upstream.
    
    In some cases, ocfs2_iget() reads the data of inode, which has been
    deleted for some reason.  That will make the system panic.  So We should
    judge whether this inode has been deleted, and tell the caller that the
    inode is a bad inode.
    
    For example, the ocfs2 is used as the backed of nfs, and the client is
    nfsv3.  This issue can be reproduced by the following steps.
    
    on the nfs server side,
    ..../patha/pathb
    
    Step 1: The process A was scheduled before calling the function fh_verify.
    
    Step 2: The process B is removing the 'pathb', and just completed the call
    to function dput.  Then the dentry of 'pathb' has been deleted from the
    dcache, and all ancestors have been deleted also.  The relationship of
    dentry and inode was deleted through the function hlist_del_init.  The
    following is the call stack.
    dentry_iput->hlist_del_init(&dentry->d_u.d_alias)
    
    At this time, the inode is still in the dcache.
    
    Step 3: The process A call the function ocfs2_get_dentry, which get the
    inode from dcache.  Then the refcount of inode is 1.  The following is the
    call stack.
    nfsd3_proc_getacl->fh_verify->exportfs_decode_fh->fh_to_dentry(ocfs2_get_dentry)
    
    Step 4: Dirty pages are flushed by bdi threads.  So the inode of 'patha'
    is evicted, and this directory was deleted.  But the inode of 'pathb'
    can't be evicted, because the refcount of the inode was 1.
    
    Step 5: The process A keep running, and call the function
    reconnect_path(in exportfs_decode_fh), which call function
    ocfs2_get_parent of ocfs2.  Get the block number of parent
    directory(patha) by the name of ...  Then read the data from disk by the
    block number.  But this inode has been deleted, so the system panic.
    
    Process A                                             Process B
    1. in nfsd3_proc_getacl                   |
    2.                                        |        dput
    3. fh_to_dentry(ocfs2_get_dentry)         |
    4. bdi flush dirty cache                  |

    mm/mincore.c: make mincore() more conservative
    
    commit 134fca9063ad4851de767d1768180e5dede9a881 upstream.
    
    The semantics of what mincore() considers to be resident is not
    completely clear, but Linux has always (since 2.3.52, which is when
    mincore() was initially done) treated it as "page is available in page
    cache".
    
    That's potentially a problem, as that [in]directly exposes
    meta-information about pagecache / memory mapping state even about
    memory not strictly belonging to the process executing the syscall,
    opening possibilities for sidechannel attacks.
    
    Change the semantics of mincore() so that it only reveals pagecache
    information for non-anonymous mappings that belog to files that the
    calling process could (if it tried to) successfully open for writing;
    otherwise we'd be including shared non-exclusive mappings, which
    
     - is the sidechannel
    
     - is not the usecase for mincore(), as that's primarily used for data,
       not (shared) text

    ASoC: RT5677-SPI: Disable 16Bit SPI Transfers
    
    commit a46eb523220e242affb9a6bc9bb8efc05f4f7459 upstream.
    
    The current algorithm allows 3 types of transfers, 16bit, 32bit and
    burst. According to Realtek, 16bit transfers have a special restriction
    in that it is restricted to the memory region of
    0x18020000 ~ 0x18021000. This region is the memory location of the I2C
    registers. The current algorithm does not uphold this restriction and
    therefore fails to complete writes.
    
    Since this has been broken for some time it likely no one is using it.
    Better to simply disable the 16 bit writes. This will allow users to
    properly load firmware over SPI without data corruption.

    ASoC: max98090: Fix restore of DAPM Muxes
    
    commit ecb2795c08bc825ebd604997e5be440b060c5b18 upstream.
    
    The max98090 driver defines 3 DAPM muxes; one for the right line output
    (LINMOD Mux), one for the left headphone mixer source (MIXHPLSEL Mux)
    and one for the right headphone mixer source (MIXHPRSEL Mux). The same
    bit is used for the mux as well as the DAPM enable, and although the mux
    can be correctly configured, after playback has completed, the mux will
    be reset during the disable phase. This is preventing the state of these
    muxes from being saved and restored correctly on system reboot. Fix this
    by marking these muxes as SND_SOC_NOPM.
    
    Note this has been verified this on the Tegra124 Nyan Big which features
    the MAX98090 codec.

    ALSA: hda/hdmi - Consider eld_valid when reporting jack event
    
    commit 7f641e26a6df9269cb25dd7a4b0a91d6586ed441 upstream.
    
    On the machines with AMD GPU or Nvidia GPU, we often meet this issue:
    after s3, there are 4 HDMI/DP audio devices in the gnome-sound-setting
    even there is no any monitors plugged.
    
    When this problem happens, we check the /proc/asound/cardX/eld#N.M, we
    will find the monitor_present=1, eld_valid=0.
    
    The root cause is BIOS or GPU driver makes the PRESENCE valid even no
    monitor plugged, and of course the driver will not get the valid
    eld_data subsequently.
    
    In this situation, we should not report the jack_plugged event, to do
    so, let us change the function hdmi_present_sense_via_verbs(). In this
    function, it reads the pin_sense via snd_hda_pin_sense(), after
    calling this function, the jack_dirty is 0, and before exiting
    via_verbs(), we change the shadow pin_sense according to both
    monitor_present and eld_valid, then in the snd_hda_jack_report_sync(),
    since the jack_dirty is still 0, it will report jack event according
    to this modified shadow pin_sense.
    
    After this change, the driver will not report Jack_is_plugged event
    through hdmi_present_sense_via_verbs() if monitor_present is 1 and
    eld_valid is 0.

    ALSA: hda/hdmi - Read the pin sense from register when repolling
    
    commit 8c2e6728c2bf95765b724e07d0278ae97cd1ee0d upstream.
    
    The driver will check the monitor presence when resuming from suspend,
    starting poll or interrupt triggers. In these 3 situations, the
    jack_dirty will be set to 1 first, then the hda_jack.c reads the
    pin_sense from register, after reading the register, the jack_dirty
    will be set to 0. But hdmi_repoll_work() is enabled in these 3
    situations, It will read the pin_sense a couple of times subsequently,
    since the jack_dirty is 0 now, It does not read the register anymore,
    instead it uses the shadow pin_sense which is read at the first time.
    
    It is meaningless to check the shadow pin_sense a couple of times,
    we need to read the register to check the real plugging state, so
    we set the jack_dirty to 1 in the hdmi_repoll_work().

    commit cb5173594d50c72b7bfa14113dfc5084b4d2f726 upstream.
    
    In parse_audio_selector_unit(), the string array 'namelist' is allocated
    through kmalloc_array(), and each string pointer in this array, i.e.,
    'namelist[]', is allocated through kmalloc() in the following for loop.
    Then, a control instance 'kctl' is created by invoking snd_ctl_new1(). If
    an error occurs during the creation process, the string array 'namelist',
    including all string pointers in the array 'namelist[]', should be freed,
    before the error code ENOMEM is returned. However, the current code does
    not free 'namelist[]', resulting in memory leaks.
    
    To fix the above issue, free all string pointers 'namelist[]' in a loop.

    crypto: arm/aes-neonbs - don't access already-freed walk.iv
    
    commit 767f015ea0b7ab9d60432ff6cd06b664fd71f50f upstream.
    
    If the user-provided IV needs to be aligned to the algorithm's
    alignmask, then skcipher_walk_virt() copies the IV into a new aligned
    buffer walk.iv.  But skcipher_walk_virt() can fail afterwards, and then
    if the caller unconditionally accesses walk.iv, it's a use-after-free.
    
    arm32 xts-aes-neonbs doesn't set an alignmask, so currently it isn't
    affected by this despite unconditionally accessing walk.iv.  However
    this is more subtle than desired, and it was actually broken prior to
    the alignmask being removed by commit cc477bf64573 ("crypto: arm/aes -
    replace bit-sliced OpenSSL NEON code").  Thus, update xts-aes-neonbs to
    start checking the return value of skcipher_walk_virt().

    crypto: gcm - fix incompatibility between "gcm" and "gcm_base"
    
    commit f699594d436960160f6d5ba84ed4a222f20d11cd upstream.
    
    GCM instances can be created by either the "gcm" template, which only
    allows choosing the block cipher, e.g. "gcm(aes)"; or by "gcm_base",
    which allows choosing the ctr and ghash implementations, e.g.
    "gcm_base(ctr(aes-generic),ghash-generic)".
    
    However, a "gcm_base" instance prevents a "gcm" instance from being
    registered using the same implementations.  Nor will the instance be
    found by lookups of "gcm".  This can be used as a denial of service.
    Moreover, "gcm_base" instances are never tested by the crypto
    self-tests, even if there are compatible "gcm" tests.
    
    The root cause of these problems is that instances of the two templates
    use different cra_names.  Therefore, fix these problems by making
    "gcm_base" instances set the same cra_name as "gcm" instances, e.g.
    "gcm(aes)" instead of "gcm_base(ctr(aes-generic),ghash-generic)".
    
    This requires extracting the block cipher name from the name of the ctr
    algorithm.  It also requires starting to verify that the algorithms are
    really ctr and ghash, not something else entirely.  But it would be
    bizarre if anyone were actually using non-gcm-compatible algorithms with
    gcm_base, so this shouldn't break anyone in practice.

    crypto: x86/crct10dif-pcl - fix use via crypto_shash_digest()
    
    commit dec3d0b1071a0f3194e66a83d26ecf4aa8c5910e upstream.
    
    The ->digest() method of crct10dif-pclmul reads the current CRC value
    from the shash_desc context.  But this value is uninitialized, causing
    crypto_shash_digest() to compute the wrong result.  Fix it.
    
    Probably this wasn't noticed before because lib/crc-t10dif.c only uses
    crypto_shash_update(), not crypto_shash_digest().  Likewise,
    crypto_shash_digest() is not yet tested by the crypto self-tests because
    those only test the ahash API which only uses shash init/update/final.

    commit 307508d1072979f4435416f87936f87eaeb82054 upstream.
    
    The ->digest() method of crct10dif-generic reads the current CRC value
    from the shash_desc context.  But this value is uninitialized, causing
    crypto_shash_digest() to compute the wrong result.  Fix it.
    
    Probably this wasn't noticed before because lib/crc-t10dif.c only uses
    crypto_shash_update(), not crypto_shash_digest().  Likewise,
    crypto_shash_digest() is not yet tested by the crypto self-tests because
    those only test the ahash API which only uses shash init/update/final.
    
    This bug was detected by my patches that improve testmgr to fuzz
    algorithms against their generic implementation.

    crypto: skcipher - don't WARN on unprocessed data after slow walk step
    
    commit dcaca01a42cc2c425154a13412b4124293a6e11e upstream.
    
    skcipher_walk_done() assumes it's a bug if, after the "slow" path is
    executed where the next chunk of data is processed via a bounce buffer,
    the algorithm says it didn't process all bytes.  Thus it WARNs on this.
    
    However, this can happen legitimately when the message needs to be
    evenly divisible into "blocks" but isn't, and the algorithm has a
    'walksize' greater than the block size.  For example, ecb-aes-neonbs
    sets 'walksize' to 128 bytes and only supports messages evenly divisible
    into 16-byte blocks.  If, say, 17 message bytes remain but they straddle
    scatterlist elements, the skcipher_walk code will take the "slow" path
    and pass the algorithm all 17 bytes in the bounce buffer.  But the
    algorithm will only be able to process 16 bytes, triggering the WARN.
    
    Fix this by just removing the WARN_ON().  Returning -EINVAL, as the code
    already does, is the right behavior.
    
    This bug was detected by my patches that improve testmgr to fuzz
    algorithms against their generic implementation.

    crypto: vmx - fix copy-paste error in CTR mode
    
    commit dcf7b48212c0fab7df69e84fab22d6cb7c8c0fb9 upstream.
    
    The original assembly imported from OpenSSL has two copy-paste
    errors in handling CTR mode. When dealing with a 2 or 3 block tail,
    the code branches to the CBC decryption exit path, rather than to
    the CTR exit path.
    
    This leads to corruption of the IV, which leads to subsequent blocks
    being corrupted.
    
    This can be detected with libkcapi test suite, which is available at
    https://github.com/smuellerDD/libkcapi

    crypto: chacha20poly1305 - set cra_name correctly
    
    commit 5e27f38f1f3f45a0c938299c3a34a2d2db77165a upstream.
    
    If the rfc7539 template is instantiated with specific implementations,
    e.g. "rfc7539(chacha20-generic,poly1305-generic)" rather than
    "rfc7539(chacha20,poly1305)", then the implementation names end up
    included in the instance's cra_name.  This is incorrect because it then
    prevents all users from allocating "rfc7539(chacha20,poly1305)", if the
    highest priority implementations of chacha20 and poly1305 were selected.
    Also, the self-tests aren't run on an instance allocated in this way.
    
    Fix it by setting the instance's cra_name from the underlying
    algorithms' actual cra_names, rather than from the requested names.
    This matches what other templates do.

    sched/x86: Save [ER]FLAGS on context switch
    
    commit 6690e86be83ac75832e461c141055b5d601c0a6d upstream.
    
    Effectively reverts commit:
    
      2c7577a75837 ("sched/x86_64: Don't save flags on context switch")
    
    Specifically because SMAP uses FLAGS.AC which invalidates the claim
    that the kernel has clean flags.
    
    In particular; while preemption from interrupt return is fine (the
    IRET frame on the exception stack contains FLAGS) it breaks any code
    that does synchonous scheduling, including preempt_enable().
    
    This has become a significant issue ever since commit:
    
      5b24a7a2aa20 ("Add 'unsafe' user access functions for batched accesses")
    
    provided for means of having 'normal' C code between STAC / CLAC,
    exposing the FLAGS.AC state. So far this hasn't led to trouble,
    however fix it before it comes apart.

    arm64: compat: Reduce address limit
    
    commit d263119387de9975d2acba1dfd3392f7c5979c18 upstream.
    
    Currently, compat tasks running on arm64 can allocate memory up to
    TASK_SIZE_32 (UL(0x100000000)).
    
    This means that mmap() allocations, if we treat them as returning an
    array, are not compliant with the sections 6.5.8 of the C standard
    (C99) which states that: "If the expression P points to an element of
    an array object and the expression Q points to the last element of the
    same array object, the pointer expression Q+1 compares greater than P".
    
    Redefine TASK_SIZE_32 to address the issue.

    objtool: Fix function fallthrough detection
    
    commit e6f393bc939d566ce3def71232d8013de9aaadde upstream.
    
    When a function falls through to the next function due to a compiler
    bug, objtool prints some obscure warnings.  For example:
    
      drivers/regulator/core.o: warning: objtool: regulator_count_voltages()+0x95: return with modified stack frame
      drivers/regulator/core.o: warning: objtool: regulator_count_voltages()+0x0: stack state mismatch: cfa1=7+32 cfa2=7+8
    
    Instead it should be printing:
    
      drivers/regulator/core.o: warning: objtool: regulator_supply_is_couple() falls through to next function regulator_count_voltages()
    
    This used to work, but was broken by the following commit:
    
      13810435b9a7 ("objtool: Support GCC 8's cold subfunctions")
    
    The padding nops at the end of a function aren't actually part of the
    function, as defined by the symbol table.  So the 'func' variable in
    validate_branch() is getting cleared to NULL when a padding nop is
    encountered, breaking the fallthrough detection.
    
    If the current instruction doesn't have a function associated with it,
    just consider it to be part of the previously detected function by not
    overwriting the previous value of 'func'.

    PCI: hv: Add pci_destroy_slot() in pci_devices_present_work(), if necessary
    
    [ Upstream commit 340d455699400f2c2c0f9b3f703ade3085cdb501 ]
    
    When we hot-remove a device, usually the host sends us a PCI_EJECT message,
    and a PCI_BUS_RELATIONS message with bus_rel->device_count == 0.
    
    When we execute the quick hot-add/hot-remove test, the host may not send
    us the PCI_EJECT message if the guest has not fully finished the
    initialization by sending the PCI_RESOURCES_ASSIGNED* message to the
    host, so it's potentially unsafe to only depend on the
    pci_destroy_slot() in hv_eject_device_work() because the code path
    
    create_root_hv_pci_bus()
     -> hv_pci_assign_slots()
    
    is not called in this case. Note: in this case, the host still sends the
    guest a PCI_BUS_RELATIONS message with bus_rel->device_count == 0.
    
    In the quick hot-add/hot-remove test, we can have such a race before
    the code path
    
    pci_devices_present_work()
     -> new_pcichild_device()
    
    adds the new device into the hbus->children list, we may have already
    received the PCI_EJECT message, and since the tasklet handler
    
    hv_pci_onchannelcallback()
    
    may fail to find the "hpdev" by calling
    
    get_pcichild_wslot(hbus, dev_message->wslot.slot)

    create_root_hv_pci_bus()
     -> hv_pci_assign_slots()
    
    creates the slot and the PCI_BUS_RELATIONS message with
    bus_rel->device_count == 0 removes the device from hbus->children, and
    we end up being unable to remove the slot in
    
    hv_pci_remove()
     -> hv_pci_remove_slots()
    
    Remove the slot in pci_devices_present_work() when the device
    is removed to address this race.
    
    pci_devices_present_work() and hv_eject_device_work() run in the
    singled-threaded hbus->wq, so there is not a double-remove issue for the
    slot.
    
    We cannot offload hv_pci_eject_device() from hv_pci_onchannelcallback()
    to the workqueue, because we need the hv_pci_onchannelcallback()
    synchronously call hv_pci_eject_device() to poll the channel
    ringbuffer to work around the "hangs in hv_compose_msi_msg()" issue

    PCI: hv: Add hv_pci_remove_slots() when we unload the driver
    
    [ Upstream commit 15becc2b56c6eda3d9bf5ae993bafd5661c1fad1 ]
    
    When we unload the pci-hyperv host controller driver, the host does not
    send us a PCI_EJECT message.
    
    In this case we also need to make sure the sysfs PCI slot directory is
    removed, otherwise a command on a slot file eg:
    
    "cat /sys/bus/pci/slots/2/address"
    
    will trigger a
    
    "BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request"
    
    and, if we unload/reload the driver several times we would end up with
    stale slot entries in PCI slot directories in /sys/bus/pci/slots/
    
    root@localhost:~# ls -rtl  /sys/bus/pci/slots/
    total 0
    drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Feb  7 10:49 2
    drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Feb  7 10:49 2-1
    drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Feb  7 10:51 2-2
    
    Add the missing code to remove the PCI slot and fix the current
    behaviour.

    PCI: hv: Fix a memory leak in hv_eject_device_work()
    
    [ Upstream commit 05f151a73ec2b23ffbff706e5203e729a995cdc2 ]
    
    When a device is created in new_pcichild_device(), hpdev->refs is set
    to 2 (i.e. the initial value of 1 plus the get_pcichild()).
    
    When we hot remove the device from the host, in a Linux VM we first call
    hv_pci_eject_device(), which increases hpdev->refs by get_pcichild() and
    then schedules a work of hv_eject_device_work(), so hpdev->refs becomes
    3 (let's ignore the paired get/put_pcichild() in other places). But in
    hv_eject_device_work(), currently we only call put_pcichild() twice,
    meaning the 'hpdev' struct can't be freed in put_pcichild().
    
    Add one put_pcichild() to fix the memory leak.
    
    The device can also be removed when we run "rmmod pci-hyperv". On this
    path (hv_pci_remove() -> hv_pci_bus_exit() -> hv_pci_devices_present()),
    hpdev->refs is 2, and we do correctly call put_pcichild() twice in
    pci_devices_present_work().

    locking/rwsem: Prevent decrement of reader count before increment
    
    [ Upstream commit a9e9bcb45b1525ba7aea26ed9441e8632aeeda58 ]
    
    During my rwsem testing, it was found that after a down_read(), the
    reader count may occasionally become 0 or even negative. Consequently,
    a writer may steal the lock at that time and execute with the reader
    in parallel thus breaking the mutual exclusion guarantee of the write
    lock. In other words, both readers and writer can become rwsem owners
    simultaneously.
    
    The current reader wakeup code does it in one pass to clear waiter->task
    and put them into wake_q before fully incrementing the reader count.
    Once waiter->task is cleared, the corresponding reader may see it,
    finish the critical section and do unlock to decrement the count before
    the count is incremented. This is not a problem if there is only one
    reader to wake up as the count has been pre-incremented by 1.  It is
    a problem if there are more than one readers to be woken up and writer
    can steal the lock.
    
    The wakeup was actually done in 2 passes before the following v4.9 commit:
    
      70800c3c0cc5 ("locking/rwsem: Scan the wait_list for readers only once")
    
    To fix this problem, the wakeup is now done in two passes
    again. In the first pass, we collect the readers and count them.
    The reader count is then fully incremented. In the second pass, the
    waiter->task is then cleared and they are put into wake_q to be woken
    up later.

    net: core: another layer of lists, around PF_MEMALLOC skb handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 78ed8cc25986ac5c21762eeddc1e86e94d422e36 ]
    
    First example of a layer splitting the list (rather than merely taking
     individual packets off it).
    Involves new list.h function, list_cut_before(), like list_cut_position()
     but cuts on the other side of the given entry.
