    Fix "qla2xxx: terminate exchange when command is aborted by LIO"
    
    This fixes commit f67924cc39badbc813bd1935f9a025065a6a6534 which was
    commit 7359df25a53386dd33c223672bbd12cb49d0ce4f upstream.
    
    When backporting the patch, there was an unused variable, and the printk
    type was incorrect.  Fix this up by moving back to the correct type as
    shown in commit 649ee05499d1257a3af0e10d961a1c52d9ef95b7 and remove the
    unneeded variable.
    
    This fixes up two build warnings.

    Commit dd4fff23f0f4c7c5414f50c091c78a7e423f85da which is commit
    fac8e0f579695a3ecbc4d3cac369139d7f819971 upstream, seems to have
    included the sit_gro_receive function, yet it never is used, causing an
    obvious warning message.  Hook it up to the correct sit_offload
    structure.
    
    Note, for 3.16, the backport of fac8e0f579695a3ecbc4d3cac369139d7f819971
    does not include this function, nor the ipip case.  I'm guessing that
    this is not correct for 3.18, as one of the functions was included, but
    could be totally wrong.

    drm/i915: cleanup some indenting
    
    commit ba0635ffb7665d76715b43ae8144e014a90c1e63 upstream.
    
    Static checkers complain that we should probably add curly braces
    because, from the indenting, it looks like seq_printf() should be inside
    the list_for_each_entry() loop.  But the code is actually correct, it's
    just the indenting which is off.
    
    Besides fixing the indenting on seq_printf(), I did add curly braces,
    because generally mult-line indents should have curly braces to make
    them more readable.
    
    The unintended indent was left behind and not unindented in

    net:Add sysctl_max_skb_frags
    
    commit 5f74f82ea34c0da80ea0b49192bb5ea06e063593 upstream.
    
    Devices may have limits on the number of fragments in an skb they support.
    Current codebase uses a constant as maximum for number of fragments one
    skb can hold and use.
    When enabling scatter/gather and running traffic with many small messages
    the codebase uses the maximum number of fragments and may thereby violate
    the max for certain devices.
    The patch introduces a global variable as max number of fragments.

    blk: rq_data_dir() should not return a boolean
    
    commit 10fbd36e362a0f367e34a7cd876a81295d8fc5ca upstream.
    
    rq_data_dir() returns either READ or WRITE (0 == READ, 1 == WRITE), not
    a boolean value.
    
    Now, admittedly the "!= 0" doesn't really change the value (0 stays as
    zero, 1 stays as one), but it's not only redundant, it confuses gcc, and
    causes gcc to warn about the construct
    
        switch (rq_data_dir(req)) {
            case READ:
                ...
            case WRITE:
                ...
    
    that we have in a few drivers.
    
    Now, the gcc warning is silly and stupid (it seems to warn not about the
    switch value having a different type from the case statements, but about
    _any_ boolean switch value), but in this case the code itself is silly
    and stupid too, so let's just change it, and get rid of warnings like
    this:
    
      drivers/block/hd.c: In function ‘hd_request’:
      drivers/block/hd.c:630:11: warning: switch condition has boolean value [-Wswitch-bool]
         switch (rq_data_dir(req)) {
    
    The odd '!= 0' came in when "cmd_flags" got turned into a "u64" in
    commit 5953316dbf90 ("block: make rq->cmd_flags be 64-bit") and is
    presumably because the old code (that just did a logical 'and' with 1)
    would then end up making the type of rq_data_dir() be u64 too.
    
    But if we want to retain the old regular integer type, let's just cast
    the result to 'int' rather than use that rather odd '!= 0'.

    x86/boot: Add CONFIG_PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS quirk to arch/x86/boot/compressed/misc.h
    
    commit 927392d73a97d8d235bb65400e2e3c7f0bec2b6f upstream.
    
    Linus reported the following new warning on x86 allmodconfig with GCC 5.1:
    
      > ./arch/x86/include/asm/spinlock.h: In function ‘arch_spin_lock’:
      > ./arch/x86/include/asm/spinlock.h:119:3: warning: implicit declaration
      > of function ‘__ticket_lock_spinning’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
      >    __ticket_lock_spinning(lock, inc.tail);
      >    ^
    
    This warning triggers because of these hacks in misc.h:
    
      /*
       * we have to be careful, because no indirections are allowed here, and
       * paravirt_ops is a kind of one. As it will only run in baremetal anyway,
       * we just keep it from happening
       */
      #undef CONFIG_PARAVIRT
      #undef CONFIG_KASAN
    
    But these hacks were not updated when CONFIG_PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS was added,
    and eventually (with the introduction of queued paravirt spinlocks in
    recent kernels) this created an invalid Kconfig combination and broke
    the build.
    
    So add a CONFIG_PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS #undef line as well.
    
    Also remove the _ASM_X86_DESC_H quirk: that undocumented quirk
    was originally added ages ago, in:
    
      099e1377269a ("x86: use ELF format in compressed images.")
    
    and I went back to that kernel (and fixed up the main Makefile
    which didn't build anymore) and checked what failure it
    avoided: it avoided an include file dependencies related
    build failure related to our old x86-platforms code.
    
    That old code is long gone, the header dependencies got cleaned
    up, and the build does not fail anymore with the totality of
    asm/desc.h included - so remove the quirk.

    xilinx usb2 gadget: get rid of incredibly annoying compile warning
    
    commit 7796c11c728ad40ba4151d559a949c002deffb9a upstream.
    
    This one was driving me mad, with several lines of warnings during the
    allmodconfig build for a single bogus pointer cast.  The warning was so
    verbose due to the indirect macro expansion explanation, and the whole
    thing was just for a debug printout.
    
    The bogus pointer-to-integer cast was pointless anyway, so just remove
    it, and use '%p' to show the pointer.

    is misleadingly indented: the
      db->init=0
    is indented as if part of the else clause at line 1086, but it is
    independent of it (no braces before the "if" at line 1087).
    
    This patch fixes the indentation to reflect the actual meaning of the code,
    though is it actually meant to be part of the "else" clause?  (I'm a
    compiler developer, not a kernel person).  It also adds spaces around
    the assignment, to placate checkpatch.pl.
    
    Seen via an experimental new gcc warning I'm working on for gcc 6,
    -Wmisleading-indentation, using gcc r223098 adding
    -Werror=misleading-indentation to KBUILD_CFLAGS in Makefile.
    The experimental GCC emits this warning (as an error), rightly IMHO:
    
    drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/uli526x.c: In function ‘uli526x_timer’:
    drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/uli526x.c:1118:3: error: statement is

    media: remove unused variable that causes a warning
    
    commit 1d11437f4fd02f9b5d3749675a1232216787dcc6 upstream.
    
    My 'allmodconfig' build is _almost_ free of warnings, and most of the
    remaining ones are for legacy drivers that just do bad things that I
    can't find it in my black heart to care too much about.  But this one
    was just annoying me:
    
       drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf2-core.c:3256:26: warning: unused variable ‘fileio’ [-Wunused-variable]
    
    because commit 0e661006370b ("[media] vb2: fix 'UNBALANCED' warnings
    when calling vb2_thread_stop()") removed all users of 'fileio' and
    instead calls "__vb2_cleanup_fileio(q)" to clean up q->fileio.  But the
    now unused 'fileio' variable was left around.

    ata: hpt366: fix constant cast warning
    
    commit 6ec0a86c645be3fce7ade42f165a6a417c3503b1 upstream.
    
    gcc-5.x warns about a preexisting problem in the hpt36x pata driver:
    
    drivers/ata/pata_hpt366.c: In function 'hpt36x_init_one':
    drivers/ata/pata_hpt366.c:376:9: warning: assignment discards 'const' qualifier from pointer target type [-Wdiscarded-array-qualifiers]
    
    Other ata drivers have the same problem, as ata_pci_bmdma_init_one
    takes a non-const pointer, and they solve it by using a cast to
    turn that pointer into a normal non-const pointer.
    
    I also tried to change the ata core code to make host->private_data
    a const pointer, but that quickly got out of hand, as some other
    drivers expect it to be writable, so I ended up using the same
    hack as the others here.

    netfilter: Fix switch statement warnings with recent gcc.
    
    commit c1f866767777d1c6abae0ec57effffcb72017c00 upstream.
    
    More recent GCC warns about two kinds of switch statement uses:
    
    1) Switching on an enumeration, but not having an explicit case
       statement for all members of the enumeration.  To show the
       compiler this is intentional, we simply add a default case
       with nothing more than a break statement.
    
    2) Switching on a boolean value.  I think this warning is dumb
       but nevertheless you get it wholesale with -Wswitch.
    
    This patch cures all such warnings in netfilter.

    Disable "frame-address" warning
    
    commit 124a3d88fa20e1869fc229d7d8c740cc81944264 upstream.
    
    Newer versions of gcc warn about the use of __builtin_return_address()
    with a non-zero argument when "-Wall" is specified:
    
      kernel/trace/trace_irqsoff.c: In function ‘stop_critical_timings’:
      kernel/trace/trace_irqsoff.c:433:86: warning: calling ‘__builtin_return_address’ with a nonzero argument is unsafe [-Wframe-address]
         stop_critical_timing(CALLER_ADDR0, CALLER_ADDR1);
      [ .. repeats a few times for other similar cases .. ]
    
    It is true that a non-zero argument is somewhat dangerous, and we do not
    actually have very many uses of that in the kernel - but the ftrace code
    does use it, and as Stephen Rostedt says:
    
     "We are well aware of the danger of using __builtin_return_address() of
      > 0.  In fact that's part of the reason for having the "thunk" code in
      x86 (See arch/x86/entry/thunk_{64,32}.S).  [..] it adds extra frames
      when tracking irqs off sections, to prevent __builtin_return_address()
      from accessing bad areas.  In fact the thunk_32.S states: 'Trampoline to
      trace irqs off.  (otherwise CALLER_ADDR1 might crash)'."
    
    For now, __builtin_return_address() with a non-zero argument is the best
    we can do, and the warning is not helpful and can end up making people
    miss other warnings for real problems.
    
    So disable the frame-address warning on compilers that need it.

    net: caif: fix misleading indentation
    
    commit 8e0cc8c326d99e41468c96fea9785ab78883a281 upstream.
    
    gcc points out code that is not indented the way it is
    interpreted:
    
    net/caif/cfpkt_skbuff.c: In function 'cfpkt_setlen':
    net/caif/cfpkt_skbuff.c:289:4: error: statement is indented as if it were guarded by... [-Werror=misleading-indentation]
        return cfpkt_getlen(pkt);

    net/caif/cfpkt_skbuff.c:286:3: note: ...this 'else' clause, but it is not
       else
       ^~~~
    
    It is clear from the context that not returning here would be
    a bug, as we'd end up passing a negative length into a function
    that takes a u16 length, so it is not missing curly braces
    here, and I'm assuming that the indentation is the only part
    that's wrong about it.

    module: fix types of device tables aliases
    
    commit 6301939d97d079f0d3dbe71e750f4daf5d39fc33 upstream.
    
    MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() macro used to create aliases to device tables.
    Normally alias should have the same type as aliased symbol.
    
    Device tables are arrays, so they have 'struct type##_device_id[x]'
    types. Alias created by MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() will have non-array type -
            'struct type##_device_id'.
    
    This inconsistency confuses compiler, it could make a wrong assumption
    about variable's size which leads KASan to produce a false positive report
    about out of bounds access.
    
    For every global variable compiler calls __asan_register_globals() passing
    information about global variable (address, size, size with redzone, name
    ...) __asan_register_globals() poison symbols redzone to detect possible
    out of bounds accesses.
    
    When symbol has an alias __asan_register_globals() will be called as for
    symbol so for alias.  Compiler determines size of variable by size of
    variable's type.  Alias and symbol have the same address, so if alias have
    the wrong size part of memory that actually belongs to the symbol could be
    poisoned as redzone of alias symbol.
    
    By fixing type of alias symbol we will fix size of it, so
    __asan_register_globals() will not poison valid memory.
