    USB: CDC-ACM: fix poison/unpoison imbalance
    
    commit a8b3b519618f30a87a304c4e120267ce6f8dc68a upstream.
    
    suspend() does its poisoning conditionally, resume() does it
    unconditionally. On a device with combined interfaces this
    will balance, on a device with two interfaces the counter will
    go negative and resubmission will fail.
    
    Both actions need to be done conditionally.

    net: hso: fix NULL-deref on disconnect regression
    
    commit 2ad5692db72874f02b9ad551d26345437ea4f7f3 upstream.
    
    Commit 8a12f8836145 ("net: hso: fix null-ptr-deref during tty device
    unregistration") fixed the racy minor allocation reported by syzbot, but
    introduced an unconditional NULL-pointer dereference on every disconnect
    instead.
    
    Specifically, the serial device table must no longer be accessed after
    the minor has been released by hso_serial_tty_unregister().

    x86/crash: Fix crash_setup_memmap_entries() out-of-bounds access
    
    commit 5849cdf8c120e3979c57d34be55b92d90a77a47e upstream.
    
    Commit in Fixes: added support for kexec-ing a kernel on panic using a
    new system call. As part of it, it does prepare a memory map for the new
    kernel.
    
    However, while doing so, it wrongly accesses memory it has not
    allocated: it accesses the first element of the cmem->ranges[] array in
    memmap_exclude_ranges() but it has not allocated the memory for it in
    crash_setup_memmap_entries(). As KASAN reports:

    ia64: fix discontig.c section mismatches

    Fix IA64 discontig.c Section mismatch warnings.
    
    When CONFIG_SPARSEMEM=y and CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG=y, the functions
    computer_pernodesize() and scatter_node_data() should not be marked as
    __meminit because they are needed after init, on any memory hotplug
    event.  Also, early_nr_cpus_node() is called by compute_pernodesize(),
    so early_nr_cpus_node() cannot be __meminit either.
    
      WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(.text.unlikely+0x1612): Section mismatch in reference from the function arch_alloc_nodedata() to the function .meminit.text:compute_pernodesize()
      The function arch_alloc_nodedata() references the function __meminit compute_pernodesize().
      This is often because arch_alloc_nodedata lacks a __meminit annotation or the annotation of compute_pernodesize is wrong.
    
      WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(.text.unlikely+0x1692): Section mismatch in reference from the function arch_refresh_nodedata() to the function .meminit.text:scatter_node_data()

    xen-netback: Check for hotplug-status existence before watching
    
    [ Upstream commit 2afeec08ab5c86ae21952151f726bfe184f6b23d ]
    
    The logic in connect() is currently written with the assumption that
    xenbus_watch_pathfmt() will return an error for a node that does not
    exist.  This assumption is incorrect: xenstore does allow a watch to
    be registered for a nonexistent node (and will send notifications
    should the node be subsequently created).
    
    As of commit 1f2565780 ("xen-netback: remove 'hotplug-status' once it
    has served its purpose"), this leads to a failure when a domU
    transitions into XenbusStateConnected more than once.  On the first
    domU transition into Connected state, the "hotplug-status" node will
    be deleted by the hotplug_status_changed() callback in dom0.  On the
    second or subsequent domU transition into Connected state, the
    hotplug_status_changed() callback will therefore never be invoked, and
    so the backend will remain stuck in InitWait.
    
    This failure prevents scenarios such as reloading the xen-netfront
    module within a domU, or booting a domU via iPXE.  There is
    unfortunately no way for the domU to work around this dom0 bug.
    
    Fix by explicitly checking for existence of the "hotplug-status" node,
    thereby creating the behaviour that was previously assumed to exist.

    s390/entry: save the caller of psw_idle
    
    [ Upstream commit a994eddb947ea9ebb7b14d9a1267001699f0a136 ]
    
    Currently psw_idle does not allocate a stack frame and does not
    save its r14 and r15 into the save area. Even though this is valid from
    call ABI point of view, because psw_idle does not make any calls
    explicitly, in reality psw_idle is an entry point for controlled
    transition into serving interrupts. So, in practice, psw_idle stack
    frame is analyzed during stack unwinding. Depending on build options
    that r14 slot in the save area of psw_idle might either contain a value
    saved by previous sibling call or complete garbage.

    So, to make a stacktrace nicer and actually point for the real caller of
    psw_idle in this frequently occurring case, make psw_idle save its r14.

    server, if the snbep_pci2phy_map_init() return error.
    
    The uncore_extra_pci_dev[HSWEP_PCI_PCU_3] is used in the cpu_init() to
    detect the existence of the SBOX, which is a MSR type of PMON unit.
    The uncore_extra_pci_dev is allocated in the uncore_pci_init(). If the
    snbep_pci2phy_map_init() returns error, perf doesn't initialize the
    PCI type of the PMON units, so the uncore_extra_pci_dev will not be
    allocated. But perf may continue initializing the MSR type of PMON
    units. A null dereference kernel panic will be triggered.
    
    The sockets in a Haswell server or a Broadwell server are identical.
    Only need to detect the existence of the SBOX once.
    Current perf probes all available PCU devices and stores them into the
    uncore_extra_pci_dev. It's unnecessary.
    Use the pci_get_device() to replace the uncore_extra_pci_dev. Only
    detect the existence of the SBOX on the first available PCU device once.
    
    Factor out hswep_has_limit_sbox(), since the Haswell server and the
    Broadwell server uses the same way to detect the existence of the SBOX.
    
    Add some macros to replace the magic number.

    locking/qrwlock: Fix ordering in queued_write_lock_slowpath()
    
    [ Upstream commit 84a24bf8c52e66b7ac89ada5e3cfbe72d65c1896 ]
    
    While this code is executed with the wait_lock held, a reader can
    acquire the lock without holding wait_lock.  The writer side loops
    checking the value with the atomic_cond_read_acquire(), but only truly
    acquires the lock when the compare-and-exchange is completed
    successfully which isn’t ordered. This exposes the window between the
    acquire and the cmpxchg to an A-B-A problem which allows reads
    following the lock acquisition to observe values speculatively before
    the write lock is truly acquired.
    
    We've seen a problem in epoll where the reader does a xchg while
    holding the read lock, but the writer can see a value change out from
    under it.
    
      Writer                                | Reader

                                            | read_lock_irqsave(&ep->lock, flags);
         --> (observes value before unlock) |  chain_epi_lockless()
         |                                  |    epi->next = xchg(&ep->ovflist, epi);
         |                                  | read_unlock_irqrestore(&ep->lock, flags);
         |                                  |

         |-- READ_ONCE(ep->ovflist);        |
    
    A core can order the read of the ovflist ahead of the
    atomic_cmpxchg_relaxed(). Switching the cmpxchg to use acquire
    semantics addresses this issue at which point the atomic_cond_read can
    be switched to use relaxed semantics.

    gup: document and work around "COW can break either way" issue
    
    commit 17839856fd588f4ab6b789f482ed3ffd7c403e1f upstream.
    
    Doing a "get_user_pages()" on a copy-on-write page for reading can be
    ambiguous: the page can be COW'ed at any time afterwards, and the
    direction of a COW event isn't defined.
    
    Yes, whoever writes to it will generally do the COW, but if the thread
    that did the get_user_pages() unmapped the page before the write (and
    that could happen due to memory pressure in addition to any outright
    action), the writer could also just take over the old page instead.
    
    End result: the get_user_pages() call might result in a page pointer
    that is no longer associated with the original VM, and is associated
    with - and controlled by - another VM having taken it over instead.
    
    So when doing a get_user_pages() on a COW mapping, the only really safe
    thing to do would be to break the COW when getting the page, even when
    only getting it for reading.
    
    At the same time, some users simply don't even care.
    
    For example, the perf code wants to look up the page not because it
    cares about the page, but because the code simply wants to look up the
    physical address of the access for informational purposes, and doesn't
    really care about races when a page might be unmapped and remapped
    elsewhere.
    
    This adds logic to force a COW event by setting FOLL_WRITE on any
    copy-on-write mapping when FOLL_GET (or FOLL_PIN) is used to get a page
    pointer as a result.
    
    The current semantics end up being:
    
     - __get_user_pages_fast(): no change. If you don't ask for a write,
       you won't break COW. You'd better know what you're doing.
    
     - get_user_pages_fast(): the fast-case "look it up in the page tables
       without anything getting mmap_sem" now refuses to follow a read-only
       page, since it might need COW breaking.  Which happens in the slow
       path - the fast path doesn't know if the memory might be COW or not.
    
     - get_user_pages() (including the slow-path fallback for gup_fast()):
       for a COW mapping, turn on FOLL_WRITE for FOLL_GET/FOLL_PIN, with
       very similar semantics to FOLL_FORCE.
    
    If it turns out that we want finer granularity (ie "only break COW when
    it might actually matter" - things like the zero page are special and
    don't need to be broken) we might need to push these semantics deeper
    into the lookup fault path.  So if people care enough, it's possible
    that we might end up adding a new internal FOLL_BREAK_COW flag to go
    with the internal FOLL_COW flag we already have for tracking "I had a
    COW".
    
    Alternatively, if it turns out that different callers might want to
    explicitly control the forced COW break behavior, we might even want to
    make such a flag visible to the users of get_user_pages() instead of
    using the above default semantics.
    
    But for now, this is mostly commentary on the issue (this commit message
    being a lot bigger than the patch, and that patch in turn is almost all
    comments), with that minimal "enable COW breaking early" logic using the
    existing FOLL_WRITE behavior.
    
    [ It might be worth noting that we've always had this ambiguity, and it
      could arguably be seen as a user-space issue.
    
      You only get private COW mappings that could break either way in
      situations where user space is doing cooperative things (ie fork()
      before an execve() etc), but it _is_ surprising and very subtle, and
      fork() is supposed to give you independent address spaces.
    
      So let's treat this as a kernel issue and make the semantics of
      get_user_pages() easier to understand. Note that obviously a true
      shared mapping will still get a page that can change under us, so this
      does _not_ mean that get_user_pages() somehow returns any "stable"
      page ]
    
    [surenb: backport notes
            Replaced (gup_flags | FOLL_WRITE) with write=1 in gup_pgd_range.
            Removed FOLL_PIN usage in should_force_cow_break since it's missing in
            the earlier kernels.]

    net: phy: marvell: fix detection of PHY on Topaz switches
    
    commit 1fe976d308acb6374c899a4ee8025a0a016e453e upstream.
    
    Since commit fee2d546414d ("net: phy: marvell: mv88e6390 temperature
    sensor reading"), Linux reports the temperature of Topaz hwmon as
    constant -75°C.
    
    This is because switches from the Topaz family (88E6141 / 88E6341) have
    the address of the temperature sensor register different from Peridot.
    
    This address is instead compatible with 88E1510 PHYs, as was used for
    Topaz before the above mentioned commit.
    
    Create a new mapping table between switch family and PHY ID for families
    which don't have a model number. And define PHY IDs for Topaz and Peridot
    families.
    
    Create a new PHY ID and a new PHY driver for Topaz's internal PHY.
    The only difference from Peridot's PHY driver is the HWMON probing
    method.
    
    Prior this change Topaz's internal PHY is detected by kernel as:
    
      PHY [...] driver [Marvell 88E6390] (irq=63)
    
    And afterwards as:
    
      PHY [...] driver [Marvell 88E6341 Family] (irq=63)

    ARM: 9071/1: uprobes: Don't hook on thumb instructions
    
    commit d2f7eca60b29006285d57c7035539e33300e89e5 upstream.
    
    Since uprobes is not supported for thumb, check that the thumb bit is
    not set when matching the uprobes instruction hooks.
    
    The Arm UDF instructions used for uprobes triggering
    (UPROBE_SWBP_ARM_INSN and UPROBE_SS_ARM_INSN) coincidentally share the
    same encoding as a pair of unallocated 32-bit thumb instructions (not
    UDF) when the condition code is 0b1111 (0xf). This in effect makes it
    possible to trigger the uprobes functionality from thumb, and at that
    using two unallocated instructions which are not permanently undefined.

    ibmvnic: avoid calling napi_disable() twice
    
    commit 0775ebc4cf8554bdcd2c212669a0868ab68df5c0 upstream.
    
    __ibmvnic_open calls napi_disable without checking whether NAPI polling
    has already been disabled or not. This could cause napi_disable
    being called twice, which could generate deadlock. For example,
    the first napi_disable will spin until NAPI_STATE_SCHED is cleared
    by napi_complete_done, then set it again.
    When napi_disable is called the second time, it will loop infinitely
    because no dev->poll will be running to clear NAPI_STATE_SCHED.
    
    To prevent above scenario from happening, call ibmvnic_napi_disable()
    which checks if napi is disabled or not before calling napi_disable.

    i40e: fix the panic when running bpf in xdpdrv mode
    
    commit 4e39a072a6a0fc422ba7da5e4336bdc295d70211 upstream.
    
    Fix this panic by adding more rules to calculate the value of @rss_size_max
    which could be used in allocating the queues when bpf is loaded, which,
    however, could cause the failure and then trigger the NULL pointer of
    vsi->rx_rings. Prio to this fix, the machine doesn't care about how many
    cpus are online and then allocates 256 queues on the machine with 32 cpus
    online actually.
    
    Once the load of bpf begins, the log will go like this "failed to get
    tracking for 256 queues for VSI 0 err -12" and this "setup of MAIN VSI
    failed".
    
    Thus, I attach the key information of the crash-log here.

    net: davicom: Fix regulator not turned off on failed probe
    
    commit 31457db3750c0b0ed229d836f2609fdb8a5b790e upstream.
    
    When the probe fails, we must disable the regulator that was previously
    enabled.
    
    This patch is a follow-up to commit ac88c531a5b3
    ("net: davicom: Fix regulator not turned off on failed probe") which missed

    scsi: libsas: Reset num_scatter if libata marks qc as NODATA
    
    commit 176ddd89171ddcf661862d90c5d257877f7326d6 upstream.
    
    When the cache_type for the SCSI device is changed, the SCSI layer issues a
    MODE_SELECT command. The caching mode details are communicated via a
    request buffer associated with the SCSI command with data direction set as
    DMA_TO_DEVICE (scsi_mode_select()). When this command reaches the libata
    layer, as a part of generic initial setup, libata layer sets up the
    scatterlist for the command using the SCSI command (ata_scsi_qc_new()).
    This command is then translated by the libata layer into
    ATA_CMD_SET_FEATURES (ata_scsi_mode_select_xlat()). The libata layer treats
    this as a non-data command (ata_mselect_caching()), since it only needs an
    ATA taskfile to pass the caching on/off information to the device. It does
    not need the scatterlist that has been setup, so it does not perform
    dma_map_sg() on the scatterlist (ata_qc_issue()). Unfortunately, when this
    command reaches the libsas layer (sas_ata_qc_issue()), libsas layer sees it
    as a non-data command with a scatterlist. It cannot extract the correct DMA
    length since the scatterlist has not been mapped with dma_map_sg() for a
    DMA operation. When this partially constructed SAS task reaches pm80xx
    LLDD, it results in the following warning:
    
    "pm80xx_chip_sata_req 6058: The sg list address
    start_addr=0x0000000000000000 data_len=0x0end_addr_high=0xffffffff
    end_addr_low=0xffffffff has crossed 4G boundary"
    
    Update libsas to handle ATA non-data commands separately so num_scatter and
    total_xfer_len remain 0.

    arm64: alternatives: Move length validation in alternative_{insn, endif}
    
    commit 22315a2296f4c251fa92aec45fbbae37e9301b6c upstream.
    
    After commit 2decad92f473 ("arm64: mte: Ensure TIF_MTE_ASYNC_FAULT is
    set atomically"), LLVM's integrated assembler fails to build entry.S:
    
    <instantiation>:5:7: error: expected assembly-time absolute expression
     .org . - (664b-663b) + (662b-661b)
          ^
    <instantiation>:6:7: error: expected assembly-time absolute expression
     .org . - (662b-661b) + (664b-663b)
          ^
    
    The root cause is LLVM's assembler has a one-pass design, meaning it
    cannot figure out these instruction lengths when the .org directive is
    outside of the subsection that they are in, which was changed by the
    .arch_extension directive added in the above commit.
    
    Apply the same fix from commit 966a0acce2fc ("arm64/alternatives: move
    length validation inside the subsection") to the alternative_endif
    macro, shuffling the .org directives so that the length validation
    happen will always happen in the same subsections. alternative_insn has
    not shown any issue yet but it appears that it could have the same issue
    in the future so just preemptively change it.

    readdir: make sure to verify directory entry for legacy interfaces too
    
    commit 0c93ac69407d63a85be0129aa55ffaec27ffebd3 upstream.
    
    This does the directory entry name verification for the legacy
    "fillonedir" (and compat) interface that goes all the way back to the
    dark ages before we had a proper dirent, and the readdir() system call
    returned just a single entry at a time.
    
    Nobody should use this interface unless you still have binaries from
    1991, but let's do it right.
    
    This came up during discussions about unsafe_copy_to_user() and proper
    checking of all the inputs to it, as the networking layer is looking to
    use it in a few new places.  So let's make sure the _old_ users do it
    all right and proper, before we add new ones.
    
    See also commit 8a23eb804ca4 ("Make filldir[64]() verify the directory
    entry filename is valid") which did the proper modern interfaces that
    people actually use. It had a note:
    
        Note that I didn't bother adding the checks to any legacy interfaces
        that nobody uses.
    
    which this now corrects.  Note that we really don't care about POSIX and
    the presense of '/' in a directory entry, but verify_dirent_name() also
    ends up doing the proper name length verification which is what the
    input checking discussion was about.
    
    [ Another option would be to remove the support for this particular very
      old interface: any binaries that use it are likely a.out binaries, and
      they will no longer run anyway since we removed a.out binftm support
      in commit eac616557050 ("x86: Deprecate a.out support").
    
      But I'm not sure which came first: getdents() or ELF support, so let's
      pretend somebody might still have a working binary that uses the
      legacy readdir() case.. ]

    dm verity fec: fix misaligned RS roots IO
    
    commit 8ca7cab82bda4eb0b8064befeeeaa38106cac637 upstream.
    
    commit df7b59ba9245 ("dm verity: fix FEC for RS roots unaligned to
    block size") introduced the possibility for misaligned roots IO
    relative to the underlying device's logical block size. E.g. Android's
    default RS roots=2 results in dm_bufio->block_size=1024, which causes
    the following EIO if the logical block size of the device is 4096,
    given v->data_dev_block_bits=12:
    
    E sd 0    : 0:0:0: [sda] tag#30 request not aligned to the logical block size
    E blk_update_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 10368424 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x0 phys_seg 1 prio class 0
    E device-mapper: verity-fec: 254:8: FEC 9244672: parity read failed (block 18056): -5
    
    Fix this by onlu using f->roots for dm_bufio blocksize IFF it is
    aligned to v->data_dev_block_bits.

    HID: wacom: set EV_KEY and EV_ABS only for non-HID_GENERIC type of devices
    
    commit 276559d8d02c2709281578976ca2f53bc62063d4 upstream.
    
    Valid HID_GENERIC type of devices set EV_KEY and EV_ABS by wacom_map_usage.
    When *_input_capabilities are reached, those devices should already have
    their proper EV_* set. EV_KEY and EV_ABS only need to be set for
    non-HID_GENERIC type of devices in *_input_capabilities.
    
    Devices that don't support HID descitoprs will pass back to hid-input for
    registration without being accidentally rejected by the introduction of
    patch: "Input: refuse to register absolute devices without absinfo"

    Bytes 2 and 1 need to be shifted left by 4 bits, the least significant
    nibble of each is stored in byte 3. Currently they are only
    being shifted by 3 causing the reported coordinates to be incorrect.
    
    This matches downstream examples, and has been confirmed on my
    device (OnePlus 7 Pro).

    mac80211: clear sta->fast_rx when STA removed from 4-addr VLAN
    
    [ Upstream commit dd0b45538146cb6a54d6da7663b8c3afd16ebcfd ]
    
    In some race conditions, with more clients and traffic configuration,
    below crash is seen when making the interface down. sta->fast_rx wasn't
    cleared when STA gets removed from 4-addr AP_VLAN interface. The crash is
    due to try accessing 4-addr AP_VLAN interface's net_device (fast_rx->dev)
    which has been deleted already.
    
    Resolve this by clearing sta->fast_rx pointer when STA removes
    from a 4-addr VLAN.

    pci_resource_start() is not a good indicator to determine if a PCI
    resource exists or not, since the resource may start at address 0.

    [ Upstream commit e7a48c710defa0e0fef54d42b7d9e4ab596e2761 ]
    
    When using the driver in I2S TDM mode, the fsl_esai_startup()
    function rewrites the number of slots previously set by the
    fsl_esai_set_dai_tdm_slot() function to 2.
    To fix this, let's use the saved slot count value or, if TDM
    is not used and the number of slots is not set, the driver will use
    the default value (2), which is set by fsl_esai_probe().

    neighbour: Disregard DEAD dst in neigh_update
    
    [ Upstream commit d47ec7a0a7271dda08932d6208e4ab65ab0c987c ]
    
    After a short network outage, the dst_entry is timed out and put
    in DST_OBSOLETE_DEAD. We are in this code because arp reply comes
    from this neighbour after network recovers. There is a potential
    race condition that dst_entry is still in DST_OBSOLETE_DEAD.
    With that, another neighbour lookup causes more harm than good.
    
    In best case all packets in arp_queue are lost. This is
    counterproductive to the original goal of finding a better path
    for those packets.
    
    I observed a worst case with 4.x kernel where a dst_entry in
    DST_OBSOLETE_DEAD state is associated with loopback net_device.
    It leads to an ethernet header with all zero addresses.
    A packet with all zero source MAC address is quite deadly with
    mac80211, ath9k and 802.11 block ack.  It fails
    ieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr in ath9k (xmit.c). Ath9k flushes tx
    queue (ath_tx_complete_aggr). BAW (block ack window) is not
    updated. BAW logic is damaged and ath9k transmission is disabled.

    lockdep: Add a missing initialization hint to the "INFO: Trying to register non-static key" message
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a85969e9d912d5dd85362ee37b5f81266e00e77 ]
    
    Since this message is printed when dynamically allocated spinlocks (e.g.
    kzalloc()) are used without initialization (e.g. spin_lock_init()),
    suggest to developers to check whether initialization functions for objects
    were called, before making developers wonder what annotation is missing.

    Fix moving mmc devices with dts aliases as discussed on the lists.
    Without this we now have internal eMMC mmc1 show up as mmc2 compared
    to the earlier order of devices.

    ARM: dts: Drop duplicate sha2md5_fck to fix clk_disable race
    
    [ Upstream commit 140a776833957539c84301dbdb4c3013876de118 ]
    
    We have a duplicate legacy clock defined for sha2md5_fck that can
    sometimes race with clk_disable() with the dts configured clock
    for OMAP4_SHA2MD5_CLKCTRL when unused clocks are disabled during
    boot causing an "Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort".

    Input: nspire-keypad - enable interrupts only when opened
    
    [ Upstream commit 69d5ff3e9e51e23d5d81bf48480aa5671be67a71 ]
    
    The driver registers an interrupt handler in _probe, but didn't configure
    them until later when the _open function is called. In between, the keypad
    can fire an IRQ due to touchpad activity, which the handler ignores. This
    causes the kernel to disable the interrupt, blocking the keypad from
    working.
    
    Fix this by disabling interrupts before registering the handler.
    Additionally, disable them in _close, so that they're only enabled while
    open.

    net/sctp: fix race condition in sctp_destroy_sock
    
    commit b166a20b07382b8bc1dcee2a448715c9c2c81b5b upstream.
    
    If sctp_destroy_sock is called without sock_net(sk)->sctp.addr_wq_lock
    held and sp->do_auto_asconf is true, then an element is removed
    from the auto_asconf_splist without any proper locking.
    
    This can happen in the following functions:
    1. In sctp_accept, if sctp_sock_migrate fails.
    2. In inet_create or inet6_create, if there is a bpf program
       attached to BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE which denies
       creation of the sctp socket.
    
    The bug is fixed by acquiring addr_wq_lock in sctp_destroy_sock
    instead of sctp_close.
    
    This addresses CVE-2021-23133.
