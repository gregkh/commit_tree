    xhci: Switch PPT ports to EHCI on shutdown.
    
    commit e95829f474f0db3a4d940cae1423783edd966027 upstream.
    
    The Intel desktop boards DH77EB and DH77DF have a hardware issue that
    can be worked around by BIOS.  If the USB ports are switched to xHCI on
    shutdown, the xHCI host will send a spurious interrupt, which will wake
    the system.  Some BIOS will work around this, but not all.
    
    The bug can be avoided if the USB ports are switched back to EHCI on
    shutdown.  The Intel Windows driver switches the ports back to EHCI, so
    change the Linux xHCI driver to do the same.
    
    Unfortunately, we can't tell the two effected boards apart from other
    working motherboards, because the vendors will change the DMI strings
    for the DH77EB and DH77DF boards to their own custom names.  One example
    is Compulab's mini-desktop, the Intense-PC.  Instead, key off the
    Panther Point xHCI host PCI vendor and device ID, and switch the ports
    over for all PPT xHCI hosts.
    
    The only impact this will have on non-effected boards is to add a couple
    hundred milliseconds delay on boot when the BIOS has to switch the ports
    over from EHCI to xHCI.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, that contain
    the commit 69e848c2090aebba5698a1620604c7dccb448684 "Intel xhci: Support

    xhci: Increase reset timeout for Renesas 720201 host.
    
    commit 22ceac191211cf6688b1bf6ecd93c8b6bf80ed9b upstream.
    
    The NEC/Renesas 720201 xHCI host controller does not complete its reset
    within 250 milliseconds.  In fact, it takes about 9 seconds to reset the
    host controller, and 1 second for the host to be ready for doorbell
    rings.  Extend the reset and CNR polling timeout to 10 seconds each.

    xhci: Add Etron XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk.
    
    commit 5cb7df2b2d3afee7638b3ef23a5bcb89c6f07bd9 upstream.
    
    Gary reports that with recent kernels, he notices more xHCI driver
    warnings:
    
    xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.0: WARN Successful completion on short TX: needs XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk?
    
    We think his Etron xHCI host controller may have the same buggy behavior
    as the Fresco Logic xHCI host.  When a short transfer is received, the
    host will mark the transfer as successfully completed when it should be
    marking it with a short completion.
    
    Fix this by turning on the XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk when the Etron
    host is discovered.  Note that Gary has revision 1, but if Etron fixes
    this bug in future revisions, the quirk will have no effect.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.36, that
    contain a backported version of commit
    1530bbc6272d9da1e39ef8e06190d42c13a02733 "xhci: Add new short TX quirk

    drm/radeon: do not reenable crtc after moving vram start address
    
    commit 81ee8fb6b52ec69eeed37fe7943446af1dccecc5 upstream.
    
    It seems we can not update the crtc scanout address. After disabling
    crtc, update to base address do not take effect after crtc being
    reenable leading to at least frame being scanout from the old crtc
    base address. Disabling crtc display request lead to same behavior.
    
    So after changing the vram address if we don't keep crtc disabled
    we will have the GPU trying to read some random system memory address
    with some iommu this will broke the crtc engine and will lead to
    broken display and iommu error message.
    
    So to avoid this, disable crtc. For flicker less boot we will need
    to avoid moving the vram start address.
    
    This patch should also fix :

    xen: mark local pages as FOREIGN in the m2p_override
    
    commit b9e0d95c041ca2d7ad297ee37c2e9cfab67a188f upstream.
    
    When the frontend and the backend reside on the same domain, even if we
    add pages to the m2p_override, these pages will never be returned by
    mfn_to_pfn because the check "get_phys_to_machine(pfn) != mfn" will
    always fail, so the pfn of the frontend will be returned instead
    (resulting in a deadlock because the frontend pages are already locked).

     [<ffffffff81a18d69>] system_call_fastpath+0x16/0x1b
    
    The explanation is in the comment within the code:
    
    We need to do this because the pages shared by the frontend
    (xen-blkfront) can be already locked (lock_page, called by
    do_read_cache_page); when the userspace backend tries to use them
    with direct_IO, mfn_to_pfn returns the pfn of the frontend, so
    do_blockdev_direct_IO is going to try to lock the same pages
    again resulting in a deadlock.
    
    A simplified call graph looks like this:
    
    pygrub                          QEMU
    -----------------------------------------------
    do_read_cache_page              io_submit
      |                              |
    lock_page                       ext3_direct_IO
                                     |
                                    bio_add_page
                                     |
                                    lock_page
    
    Internally the xen-blkback uses m2p_add_override to swizzle (temporarily)
    a 'struct page' to have a different MFN (so that it can point to another
    guest). It also can easily find out whether another pfn corresponding
    to the mfn exists in the m2p, and can set the FOREIGN bit
    in the p2m, making sure that mfn_to_pfn returns the pfn of the backend.
    
    This allows the backend to perform direct_IO on these pages, but as a
    side effect prevents the frontend from using get_user_pages_fast on
    them while they are being shared with the backend.

    fuse: verify all ioctl retry iov elements
    
    commit fb6ccff667712c46b4501b920ea73a326e49626a upstream.
    
    Commit 7572777eef78ebdee1ecb7c258c0ef94d35bad16 attempted to verify that
    the total iovec from the client doesn't overflow iov_length() but it
    only checked the first element.  The iovec could still overflow by
    starting with a small element.  The obvious fix is to check all the
    elements.
    
    The overflow case doesn't look dangerous to the kernel as the copy is
    limited by the length after the overflow.  This fix restores the
    intention of returning an error instead of successfully copying less
    than the iovec represented.
    
    I found this by code inspection.  I built it but don't have a test case.
    I'm cc:ing stable because the initial commit did as well.

    s390/compat: fix mmap compat system calls
    
    commit e85871218513c54f7dfdb6009043cb638f2fecbe upstream.
    
    The native 31 bit and the compat behaviour for the mmap system calls differ:
    
    In native 31 bit mode the passed in address for the mmap system call will be
    unmodified passed to sys_mmap_pgoff().
    In compat mode however the passed in address will be modified with
    compat_ptr() which masks out the most significant bit.
    
    The result is that in native 31 bit mode each mmap request (with MAP_FIXED)
    will fail where the most significat bit is set, while in compat mode it
    may succeed.
    
    This odd behaviour was introduced with d3815898 "[S390] mmap: add missing
    compat_ptr conversion to both mmap compat syscalls".
    
    To restore a consistent behaviour accross native and compat mode this
    patch functionally reverts the above mentioned commit.
