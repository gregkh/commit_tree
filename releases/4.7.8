    tpm_crb: fix crb_req_canceled behavior
    
    commit 72fd50e14e46dc0edf360631bdece87c2f066a97 upstream.
    
    The req_canceled() callback is used by tpm_transmit() periodically to
    check whether the request has been canceled while it is receiving a
    response from the TPM.
    
    The TPM_CRB_CTRL_CANCEL register was cleared already in the crb_cancel
    callback, which has two consequences:
    
    * Cancel might not happen.
    * req_canceled() always returns zero.
    
    A better place to clear the register is when starting to send a new
    command. The behavior of TPM_CRB_CTRL_CANCEL is described in the
    section 5.5.3.6 of the PTP specification.

    ARM: dts: MSM8064 remove flags from SPMI/MPP IRQs
    
    commit ca88696e8b73a9fa2b1de445747e9235c3a7bd50 upstream.
    
    The Qualcomm PMIC GPIO and MPP lines are problematic: the
    are fetched from the main MFD driver with platform_get_irq()
    which means that at this point they will all be assigned the
    flags set up for the interrupts in the device tree.
    
    That is problematic since these are flagged as rising edge
    and an this point the interrupt descriptor is assigned a
    rising edge, while the only thing the GPIO/MPP drivers really
    do is issue irq_get_irqchip_state() on the line to read it
    out and to provide a .to_irq() helper for *other* IRQ
    consumers.
    
    If another device tree node tries to flag the same IRQ
    for use as something else than rising edge, the kernel
    irqdomain core will protest like this:
    
      type mismatch, failed to map hwirq-NN for <FOO>!
    
    Which is what happens when the device tree defines two
    contradictory flags for the same interrupt line.
    
    To work around this and alleviate the problem, assign 0
    as flag for the interrupts taken by the PM GPIO and MPP
    drivers. This will lead to the flag being unset, and a
    second consumer requesting rising, falling, both or level
    interrupts will be respected. This is what the qcom-pm*.dtsi
    files already do.
    
    Switched to using the symbolic name IRQ_TYPE_NONE so that
    we get this more readable.

    x86/dumpstack: Fix x86_32 kernel_stack_pointer() previous stack access
    
    commit 72b4f6a5e903b071f2a7c4eb1418cbe4eefdc344 upstream.
    
    On x86_32, when an interrupt happens from kernel space, SS and SP aren't
    pushed and the existing stack is used.  So pt_regs is effectively two
    words shorter, and the previous stack pointer is normally the memory
    after the shortened pt_regs, aka '&regs->sp'.
    
    But in the rare case where the interrupt hits right after the stack
    pointer has been changed to point to an empty stack, like for example
    when call_on_stack() is used, the address immediately after the
    shortened pt_regs is no longer on the stack.  In that case, instead of
    '&regs->sp', the previous stack pointer should be retrieved from the
    beginning of the current stack page.
    
    kernel_stack_pointer() wants to do that, but it forgets to dereference
    the pointer.  So instead of returning a pointer to the previous stack,
    it returns a pointer to the beginning of the current stack.
    
    Note that it's probably outside of kernel_stack_pointer()'s scope to be
    switching stacks at all.  The x86_64 version of this function doesn't do
    it, and it would be better for the caller to do it if necessary.  But
    that's a patch for another day.  This just fixes the original intent.

    arch/x86: Handle non enumerated CPU after physical hotplug
    
    commit 2a51fe083eba7f99cbda72f5ef90cdf2f4df882c upstream.
    
    When a CPU is physically added to a system then the MADT table is not
    updated.
    
    If subsequently a kdump kernel is started on that physically added CPU then
    the ACPI enumeration fails to provide the information for this CPU which is
    now the boot CPU of the kdump kernel.
    
    As a consequence, generic_processor_info() is not invoked for that CPU so
    the number of enumerated processors is 0 and none of the initializations,
    including the logical package id management, are performed.
    
    We have code which relies on the correctness of the logical package map and
    other information which is initialized via generic_processor_info().
    Executing such code will result in undefined behaviour or kernel crashes.
    
    This problem applies only to the kdump kernel because a normal kexec will
    switch to the original boot CPU, which is enumerated in MADT, before
    jumping into the kexec kernel.
    
    The boot code already has a check for num_processors equal 0 in
    prefill_possible_map(). We can use that check as an indicator that the
    enumeration of the boot CPU did not happen and invoke generic_processor_info()
    for it. That initializes the relevant data for the boot CPU and therefore
    prevents subsequent failure.

    x86/apic: Get rid of apic_version[] array
    
    commit cff9ab2b291e64259d97add48fe073c081afe4e2 upstream.
    
    The array has a size of MAX_LOCAL_APIC, which can be as large as 32k, so it
    can consume up to 128k.
    
    The array has been there forever and was never used for anything useful
    other than a version mismatch check which was introduced in 2009.
    
    There is no reason to store the version in an array. The kernel is not
    prepared to handle different APIC versions anyway, so the real important
    part is to detect a version mismatch and warn about it, which can be done
    with a single variable as well.

    x86/pkeys: Make protection keys an "eager" feature
    
    commit d4b05923f579c234137317cdf9a5eb69ddab76d1 upstream.
    
    Our XSAVE features are divided into two categories: those that
    generate FPU exceptions, and those that do not.  MPX and pkeys do
    not generate FPU exceptions and thus can not be used lazily.  We
    disable them when lazy mode is forced on.
    
    We have a pair of masks to collect these two sets of features, but
    XFEATURE_MASK_PKRU was added to the wrong mask: XFEATURE_MASK_LAZY.
    Fix it by moving the feature to XFEATURE_MASK_EAGER.
    
    Note: this only causes problem if you boot with lazy FPU mode
    (eagerfpu=off) which is *not* the default.  It also only affects
    hardware which is not currently publicly available.  It looks like
    eager mode is going away, but we still need this patch applied
    to any kernel that has protection keys and lazy mode, which is 4.6
    through 4.8 at this point, and 4.9 if the lazy removal isn't sent
    to Linus for 4.9.

    x86/irq: Prevent force migration of irqs which are not in the vector domain
    
    commit db91aa793ff984ac048e199ea1c54202543952fe upstream.
    
    When a CPU is about to be offlined we call fixup_irqs() that resets IRQ
    affinities related to the CPU in question. The same thing is also done when
    the system is suspended to S-states like S3 (mem).
    
    For each IRQ we try to complete any on-going move regardless whether the
    IRQ is actually part of x86_vector_domain. For each IRQ descriptor we fetch
    its chip_data, assume it is of type struct apic_chip_data and manipulate it
    by clearing old_domain mask etc. For irq_chips that are not part of the
    x86_vector_domain, like those created by various GPIO drivers, will find
    their chip_data being changed unexpectly.
    
    Below is an example where GPIO chip owned by pinctrl-sunrisepoint.c gets
    corrupted after resume:
    
      # cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio
      gpiochip0: GPIOs 360-511, parent: platform/INT344B:00, INT344B:00:
       gpio-511 (                    |sysfs               ) in  hi
    
      # rtcwake -s10 -mmem
      <10 seconds passes>
    
      # cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio
      gpiochip0: GPIOs 360-511, parent: platform/INT344B:00, INT344B:00:
       gpio-511 (                    |sysfs               ) in  ?
    
    Note '?' in the output. It means the struct gpio_chip ->get function is
    NULL whereas before suspend it was there.
    
    Fix this by first checking that the IRQ belongs to x86_vector_domain before
    we try to use the chip_data as struct apic_chip_data.

    x86/boot: Fix kdump, cleanup aborted E820_PRAM max_pfn manipulation
    
    commit 917db484dc6a69969d317b3e57add4208a8d9d42 upstream.
    
    In commit:
    
      ec776ef6bbe1 ("x86/mm: Add support for the non-standard protected e820 type")
    
    Christoph references the original patch I wrote implementing pmem support.
    The intent of the 'max_pfn' changes in that commit were to enable persistent
    memory ranges to be covered by the struct page memmap by default.
    
    However, that approach was abandoned when Christoph ported the patches [1], and
    that functionality has since been replaced by devm_memremap_pages().
    
    In the meantime, this max_pfn manipulation is confusing kdump [2] that
    assumes that everything covered by the max_pfn is "System RAM".  This
    results in kdump hanging or crashing.

    arm64: fix dump_backtrace/unwind_frame with NULL tsk
    
    commit b5e7307d9d5a340d2c9fabbe1cee137d4c682c71 upstream.
    
    In some places, dump_backtrace() is called with a NULL tsk parameter,
    e.g. in bug_handler() in arch/arm64, or indirectly via show_stack() in
    core code. The expectation is that this is treated as if current were
    passed instead of NULL. Similar is true of unwind_frame().
    
    Commit a80a0eb70c358f8c ("arm64: make irq_stack_ptr more robust") didn't
    take this into account. In dump_backtrace() it compares tsk against
    current *before* we check if tsk is NULL, and in unwind_frame() we never
    set tsk if it is NULL.
    
    Due to this, we won't initialise irq_stack_ptr in either function. In
    dump_backtrace() this results in calling dump_mem() for memory
    immediately above the IRQ stack range, rather than for the relevant
    range on the task stack. In unwind_frame we'll reject unwinding frames
    on the IRQ stack.
    
    In either case this results in incomplete or misleading backtrace
    information, but is not otherwise problematic. The initial percpu areas
    (including the IRQ stacks) are allocated in the linear map, and dump_mem
    uses __get_user(), so we shouldn't access anything with side-effects,
    and will handle holes safely.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by having both functions handle the NULL tsk
    case before doing anything else with tsk.

    KVM: arm64: Require in-kernel irqchip for PMU support
    
    commit 6fe407f2d18a4f94216263f91cb7d1f08fa5887c upstream.
    
    If userspace creates a PMU for the VCPU, but doesn't create an in-kernel
    irqchip, then we end up in a nasty path where we try to take an
    uninitialized spinlock, which can lead to all sorts of breakages.
    
    Luckily, QEMU always creates the VGIC before the PMU, so we can
    establish this as ABI and check for the VGIC in the PMU init stage.
    This can be relaxed at a later time if we want to support PMU with a
    userspace irqchip.

    KVM: MIPS: Drop other CPU ASIDs on guest MMU changes
    
    commit 91e4f1b6073dd680d86cdb7e42d7cccca9db39d8 upstream.
    
    When a guest TLB entry is replaced by TLBWI or TLBWR, we only invalidate
    TLB entries on the local CPU. This doesn't work correctly on an SMP host
    when the guest is migrated to a different physical CPU, as it could pick
    up stale TLB mappings from the last time the vCPU ran on that physical
    CPU.
    
    Therefore invalidate both user and kernel host ASIDs on other CPUs,
    which will cause new ASIDs to be generated when it next runs on those
    CPUs.
    
    We're careful only to do this if the TLB entry was already valid, and
    only for the kernel ASID where the virtual address it mapped is outside
    of the guest user address range.

    KVM: PPC: Book3s PR: Allow access to unprivileged MMCR2 register
    
    commit fa73c3b25bd8d0d393dc6109a1dba3c2aef0451e upstream.
    
    The MMCR2 register is available twice, one time with number 785
    (privileged access), and one time with number 769 (unprivileged,
    but it can be disabled completely). In former times, the Linux
    kernel was using the unprivileged register 769 only, but since
    commit 8dd75ccb571f3c92c ("powerpc: Use privileged SPR number
    for MMCR2"), it uses the privileged register 785 instead.
    The KVM-PR code then of course also switched to use the SPR 785,
    but this is causing older guest kernels to crash, since these
    kernels still access 769 instead. So to support older kernels
    with KVM-PR again, we have to support register 769 in KVM-PR, too.

    xen/x86: Update topology map for PV VCPUs
    
    commit a6a198bc60e6c980a56eca24d33dc7f29139f8ea upstream.
    
    Early during boot topology_update_package_map() computes
    logical_pkg_ids for all present processors.
    
    Later, when processors are brought up, identify_cpu() updates
    these values based on phys_pkg_id which is a function of
    initial_apicid. On PV guests the latter may point to a
    non-existing node, causing logical_pkg_ids to be set to -1.
    
    Intel's RAPL uses logical_pkg_id (as topology_logical_package_id())
    to index its arrays and therefore in this case will point to index
    65535 (since logical_pkg_id is a u16). This could lead to either a
    crash or may actually access random memory location.
    
    As a workaround, we recompute topology during CPU bringup to reset
    logical_pkg_id to a valid value.
    
    (The reason for initial_apicid being bogus is because it is
    initial_apicid of the processor from which the guest is launched.
    This value is CPUID(1).EBX[31:24])

    ALSA: usb-line6: use the same declaration as definition in header for MIDI manufacturer ID
    
    commit 8da08ca03b73593d5299893bf29fc08569c3fb5f upstream.
    
    Currently, usb-line6 module exports an array of MIDI manufacturer ID and
    usb-pod module uses it. However, the declaration is not the definition in
    common header. The difference is explicit length of array. Although
    compiler calculates it and everything goes well, it's better to use the
    same representation between definition and declaration.
    
    This commit fills the length of array for usb-line6 module. As a small
    good sub-effect, this commit suppress below warnings from static analysis
    by sparse v0.5.0.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Extend DragonFly dB scale quirk to cover other variants
    
    commit eb1a74b7bea17eea31915c4f76385cefe69d9795 upstream.
    
    The DragonFly quirk added in 42e3121d90f4 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Add a more
    accurate volume quirk for AudioQuest DragonFly") applies a custom dB map
    on the volume control when its range is reported as 0..50 (0 .. 0.2dB).
    
    However, there exists at least one other variant (hw v1.0c, as opposed
    to the tested v1.2) which reports a different non-sensical volume range
    (0..53) and the custom map is therefore not applied for that device.
    
    This results in all of the volume change appearing close to 100% on
    mixer UIs that utilize the dB TLV information.
    
    Add a fallback case where no dB TLV is reported at all if the control
    range is not 0..50 but still 0..N where N <= 1000 (3.9 dB). Also
    restrict the quirk to only apply to the volume control as there is also
    a mute control which would match the check otherwise.

    operating in HighSpeed mode.
    
    In page 539 of 2.60a specification:
    
    "When issuing Clear Stall command for IN endpoints in SuperSpeed
    mode, the software must set the "ClearPendIN" bit to '1' to
    clear any pending IN transcations, so that the device does not
    expect any ACK TP from the host for the data sent earlier."
    
    It's obvious that we only need to apply this rule to those IN
    endpoints that currently operating in SuperSpeed mode.

    Add the proper use of timekeeping_delta_to_ns() to convert
    the cycle delta to nanoseconds as needed.
    
    Thanks to Brendan and Alexei for finding this quickly after
    the v4.8 release. Unfortunately the problematic commit has
    landed in some -stable trees so they'll need this fix as
    well.
    
    Many apologies for this mistake. I'll be looking to add a
    perf-clock sanity test to the kselftest timers tests soon.

    cxl: use pcibios_free_controller_deferred() when removing vPHBs
    
    commit 6f38a8b9a45833495dc878c335c5431cd98a16ed upstream.
    
    When cxl removes a vPHB, it's possible that the pci_controller may be freed
    before all references to the devices on the vPHB have been released. This
    in turn causes an invalid memory access when the devices are eventually
    released, as pcibios_release_device() attempts to call the phb's
    release_device hook.
    
    In cxl_pci_vphb_remove(), remove the existing call to
    pcibios_free_controller(). Instead, use
    pcibios_free_controller_deferred() to free the pci_controller after all
    devices have been released. Export pci_set_host_bridge_release() so we can
    do this.

    powerpc/pseries: use pci_host_bridge.release_fn() to kfree(phb)
    
    commit 2dd9c11b9d4dfbd6c070eab7b81197f65e82f1a0 upstream.
    
    This patch leverages 'struct pci_host_bridge' from the PCI subsystem
    in order to free the pci_controller only after the last reference to
    its devices is dropped (avoiding an oops in pcibios_release_device()
    if the last reference is dropped after pcibios_free_controller()).
    
    The patch relies on pci_host_bridge.release_fn() (and .release_data),
    which is called automatically by the PCI subsystem when the root bus
    is released (i.e., the last reference is dropped).  Those fields are
    set via pci_set_host_bridge_release() (e.g. in the platform-specific
    implementation of pcibios_root_bridge_prepare()).
    
    It introduces the 'pcibios_free_controller_deferred()' .release_fn()
    and it expects .release_data to hold a pointer to the pci_controller.
    
    The function implictly calls 'pcibios_free_controller()', so an user
    must *NOT* explicitly call it if using the new _deferred() callback.
    
    The functionality is enabled for pseries (although it isn't platform
    specific, and may be used by cxl).
    
    Details on not-so-elegant design choices:
    
     - Use 'pci_host_bridge.release_data' field as pointer to associated
       'struct pci_controller' so *not* to 'pci_bus_to_host(bridge->bus)'
       in pcibios_free_controller_deferred().
    
       That's because pci_remove_root_bus() sets 'host_bridge->bus = NULL'
       (so, if the last reference is released after pci_remove_root_bus()
       runs, which eventually reaches pcibios_free_controller_deferred(),
       that would hit a null pointer dereference).
    
       The cxl/vphb.c code calls pci_remove_root_bus(), and the cxl folks
       are interested in this fix.
