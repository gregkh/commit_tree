    alpha: add io{read,write}{16,32}be functions
    
    commit 25534eb7707821b796fd84f7115367e02f36aa60 upstream.
    
    These functions are used in some PCI drivers with big-endian
    MMIO space.
    
    Admittedly it is almost certain that no one this side of the
    Moon would use such a card in an Alpha but it does get us
    closer to being able to build allyesconfig or allmodconfig,
    and it enables the Debian default generic config to build.

    ext2: Fix fs corruption in ext2_get_xip_mem()
    
    commit 7ba3ec5749ddb61f79f7be17b5fd7720eebc52de upstream.
    
    Commit 8e3dffc651cb "Ext2: mark inode dirty after the function
    dquot_free_block_nodirty is called" unveiled a bug in __ext2_get_block()
    called from ext2_get_xip_mem(). That function called ext2_get_block()
    mistakenly asking it to map 0 blocks while 1 was intended. Before the
    above mentioned commit things worked out fine by luck but after that commit
    we started returning that we allocated 0 blocks while we in fact
    allocated 1 block and thus allocation was looping until all blocks in
    the filesystem were exhausted.
    
    Fix the problem by properly asking for one block and also add assertion
    in ext2_get_blocks() to catch similar problems.

    8250_pci: fix warnings in backport of Broadcom TruManage support
    
    commit 7400ce7ee9595432b2a1402b6ffcac9faf38d9ae (v3.4.92-76-g7400ce7ee959)
    was a backport of commit ebebd49a8eab5e9aa1b1f8f1614ccc3c2120f886 upstream
    ("8250/16?50: Add support for Broadcom TruManage redirected serial port")
    
    However, in the context of 3.4.x kernels, the pci setup code was
    expecting a struct uart_port and not a struct uart_8250_port, leading to
    the following concerning warnings:
    
    drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_pci.c: In function ‘pci_brcm_trumanage_setup’:
    drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_pci.c:1086:2: warning: passing argument 3 of ‘pci_default_setup’ from incompatible pointer type [enabled by default]
      int ret = pci_default_setup(priv, board, port, idx);
      ^
    drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_pci.c:1036:1: note: expected ‘struct uart_port *’ but argument is of type ‘struct uart_8250_port *’
     pci_default_setup(struct serial_private *priv,
     ^
    drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_pci.c: At top level:
    drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_pci.c:1746:3: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type [enabled by default]
       .setup  = pci_brcm_trumanage_setup,
       ^
    drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_pci.c:1746:3: warning: (near initialization for ‘pci_serial_quirks[56].setup’) [enabled by default]
    
    I'd also expect the initialization to not function correctly, and
    perhaps dereference random garbage due to this.  Since the uart_port
    is a field within the uart_8250_port, the adaptation to fix these
    warnings is a straightforward removal of a layer of indirection.

    slab/mempolicy: always use local policy from interrupt context
    
    commit e7b691b085fda913830e5280ae6f724b2a63c824 upstream.
    
    slab_node() could access current->mempolicy from interrupt context.
    However there's a race condition during exit where the mempolicy
    is first freed and then the pointer zeroed.
    
    Using this from interrupts seems bogus anyways. The interrupt
    will interrupt a random process and therefore get a random
    mempolicy. Many times, this will be idle's, which noone can change.
    
    Just disable this here and always use local for slab
    from interrupts. I also cleaned up the callers of slab_node a bit
    which always passed the same argument.
    
    I believe the original mempolicy code did that in fact,
    so it's likely a regression.

    v3: simplify. fix typo.

    Caches in most systems are identical - but not always, so we can't avoid
    the use of smp_call_function() by just looking at the boot CPU's data,
    have to fiddle with preemption instead.

    ARM: 8129/1: errata: work around Cortex-A15 erratum 830321 using dummy strex
    
    commit 2c32c65e3726c773760038910be30cce1b4d4149 upstream.
    
    On revisions of Cortex-A15 prior to r3p3, a CLREX instruction at PL1 may
    falsely trigger a watchpoint exception, leading to potential data aborts
    during exception return and/or livelock.
    
    This patch resolves the issue in the following ways:
    
      - Replacing our uses of CLREX with a dummy STREX sequence instead (as
        we did for v6 CPUs).
    
      - Removing the clrex code from v7_exit_coherency_flush and derivatives,
        since this only exists as a minor performance improvement when
        non-cached exclusives are in use (Linux doesn't use these).
    
    Benchmarking on a variety of ARM cores revealed no measurable
    performance difference with this change applied, so the change is
    performed unconditionally and no new Kconfig entry is added.

    ARM: 8128/1: abort: don't clear the exclusive monitors
    
    commit 85868313177700d20644263a782351262d2aff84 upstream.
    
    The ARMv6 and ARMv7 early abort handlers clear the exclusive monitors
    upon entry to the kernel, but this is redundant:
    
      - We clear the monitors on every exception return since commit
        200b812d0084 ("Clear the exclusive monitor when returning from an
        exception"), so this is not necessary to ensure the monitors are
        cleared before returning from a fault handler.
    
      - Any dummy STREX will target a temporary scratch area in memory, and
        may succeed or fail without corrupting useful data. Its status value
        will not be used.
    
      - Any other STREX in the kernel must be preceded by an LDREX, which
        will initialise the monitors consistently and will not depend on the
        earlier state of the monitors.
    
    Therefore we have no reason to care about the initial state of the
    exclusive monitors when a data abort is taken, and clearing the monitors
    prior to exception return (as we already do) is sufficient.
    
    This patch removes the redundant clearing of the exclusive monitors from
    the early abort handlers.

    The report passed to us from transport driver could potentially be
    arbitrarily large, therefore we better sanity-check it so that
    magicmouse_emit_touch() gets only valid values of raw_id.

    NFSv4: Fix problems with close in the presence of a delegation
    
    commit aee7af356e151494d5014f57b33460b162f181b5 upstream.
    
    In the presence of delegations, we can no longer assume that the
    state->n_rdwr, state->n_rdonly, state->n_wronly reflect the open
    stateid share mode, and so we need to calculate the initial value
    for calldata->arg.fmode using the state->flags.

    HID: logitech-dj: prevent false errors to be shown
    
    commit 5abfe85c1d4694d5d4bbd13ecc166262b937adf0 upstream.
    
    Commit "HID: logitech: perform bounds checking on device_id early
    enough" unfortunately leaks some errors to dmesg which are not real
    ones:
    - if the report is not a DJ one, then there is not point in checking
      the device_id
    - the receiver (index 0) can also receive some notifications which
      can be safely ignored given the current implementation
    
    Move out the test regarding the report_id and also discards
    printing errors when the receiver got notified.

    commit 6817ae225cd650fb1c3295d769298c38b1eba818 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a potential security issue in the whiteheat USB driver
    which might allow a local attacker to cause kernel memory corrpution. This
    is due to an unchecked memcpy into a fixed size buffer (of 64 bytes). On
    EHCI and XHCI busses it's possible to craft responses greater than 64
    bytes leading a buffer overflow.

    commit ec0a38bf8b28b036202070cf3ef271e343d9eafc upstream.
    
    Fix two reported bugs, caused by et131x_adapter->phydev->addr being accessed
    before it is initialised, by:
    
    - letting et131x_mii_write() take a phydev address, instead of using the one
      stored in adapter by default. This is so et131x_mdio_write() can use it's own
      addr value.
    - removing implementation of et131x_mdio_reset(), as it's not needed.
    - moving a call to et131x_disable_phy_coma() in et131x_pci_setup(), which uses
      phydev->addr, until after the mdiobus has been registered.

    xtensa: fix TLBTEMP_BASE_2 region handling in fast_second_level_miss
    
    commit 7128039fe2dd3d59da9e4ffa036f3aaa3ba87b9f upstream.
    
    Current definition of TLBTEMP_BASE_2 is always 32K above the
    TLBTEMP_BASE_1, whereas fast_second_level_miss handler for the TLBTEMP
    region analyzes virtual address bit (PAGE_SHIFT + DCACHE_ALIAS_ORDER)
    to determine TLBTEMP region where the fault happened. The size of the
    TLBTEMP region is also checked incorrectly: not 64K, but twice data
    cache way size (whicht may as well be less than the instruction cache
    way size).
    
    Fix TLBTEMP_BASE_2 to be TLBTEMP_BASE_1 + data cache way size.
    Provide TLBTEMP_SIZE that is a greater of doubled data cache way size or
    the instruction cache way size, and use it to determine if the second
    level TLB miss occured in the TLBTEMP region.
    
    Practical occurence of page faults in the TLBTEMP area is extremely
    rare, this code can be tested by deletion of all w[di]tlb instructions
    in the tlbtemp_mapping region.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Avoid setting wrong COEF on ALC269 & co
    
    commit f3ee07d8b6e061bf34a7167c3f564e8da4360a99 upstream.
    
    ALC269 & co have many vendor-specific setups with COEF verbs.
    However, some verbs seem specific to some codec versions and they
    result in the codec stalling.  Typically, such a case can be avoided
    by checking the return value from reading a COEF.  If the return value
    is -1, it implies that the COEF is invalid, thus it shouldn't be
    written.
    
    This patch adds the invalid COEF checks in appropriate places
    accessing ALC269 and its variants.  The patch actually fixes the
    resume problem on Acer AO725 laptop.

    md/raid6: avoid data corruption during recovery of double-degraded RAID6
    
    commit 9c4bdf697c39805078392d5ddbbba5ae5680e0dd upstream.
    
    During recovery of a double-degraded RAID6 it is possible for
    some blocks not to be recovered properly, leading to corruption.
    
    If a write happens to one block in a stripe that would be written to a
    missing device, and at the same time that stripe is recovering data
    to the other missing device, then that recovered data may not be written.
    
    This patch skips, in the double-degraded case, an optimisation that is
    only safe for single-degraded arrays.
    
    Bug was introduced in 2.6.32 and fix is suitable for any kernel since
    then.  In an older kernel with separate handle_stripe5() and
    handle_stripe6() functions the patch must change handle_stripe6().

    commit 9b29d3c6510407d91786c1cf9183ff4debb3473a upstream.
    
    When multiple devices are detached in __detach_device, they
    are also removed from the domains dev_list. This makes it
    unsafe to use list_for_each_entry_safe, as the next pointer
    might also not be in the list anymore after __detach_device
    returns. So just repeatedly remove the first element of the

    kvm: iommu: fix the third parameter of kvm_iommu_put_pages (CVE-2014-3601)
    
    commit 350b8bdd689cd2ab2c67c8a86a0be86cfa0751a7 upstream.
    
    The third parameter of kvm_iommu_put_pages is wrong,
    It should be 'gfn - slot->base_gfn'.
    
    By making gfn very large, malicious guest or userspace can cause kvm to
    go to this error path, and subsequently to pass a huge value as size.
    Alternatively if gfn is small, then pages would be pinned but never
    unpinned, causing host memory leak and local DOS.
    
    Passing a reasonable but large value could be the most dangerous case,
    because it would unpin a page that should have stayed pinned, and thus
    allow the device to DMA into arbitrary memory.  However, this cannot
    happen because of the condition that can trigger the error:
    
    - out of memory (where you can't allocate even a single page)
      should not be possible for the attacker to trigger
    
    - when exceeding the iommu's address space, guest pages after gfn
      will also exceed the iommu's address space, and inside
      kvm_iommu_put_pages() the iommu_iova_to_phys() will fail.  The
      page thus would not be unpinned at all.

    MIPS: OCTEON: make get_system_type() thread-safe
    
    commit 608308682addfdc7b8e2aee88f0e028331d88e4d upstream.
    
    get_system_type() is not thread-safe on OCTEON. It uses static data,
    also more dangerous issue is that it's calling cvmx_fuse_read_byte()
    every time without any synchronization. Currently it's possible to get
    processes stuck looping forever in kernel simply by launching multiple
    readers of /proc/cpuinfo:
    
            (while true; do cat /proc/cpuinfo > /dev/null; done) &
            (while true; do cat /proc/cpuinfo > /dev/null; done) &
            ...
    
    Fix by initializing the system type string only once during the early
    boot.

    isofs: Fix unbounded recursion when processing relocated directories
    
    commit 410dd3cf4c9b36f27ed4542ee18b1af5e68645a4 upstream.
    
    We did not check relocated directory in any way when processing Rock
    Ridge 'CL' tag. Thus a corrupted isofs image can possibly have a CL
    entry pointing to another CL entry leading to possibly unbounded
    recursion in kernel code and thus stack overflow or deadlocks (if there
    is a loop created from CL entries).
    
    Fix the problem by not allowing CL entry to point to a directory entry
    with CL entry (such use makes no good sense anyway) and by checking
    whether CL entry doesn't point to itself.

    HID: logitech: perform bounds checking on device_id early enough
    
    commit ad3e14d7c5268c2e24477c6ef54bbdf88add5d36 upstream.
    
    device_index is a char type and the size of paired_dj_deivces is 7
    elements, therefore proper bounds checking has to be applied to
    device_index before it is used.
    
    We are currently performing the bounds checking in
    logi_dj_recv_add_djhid_device(), which is too late, as malicious device
    could send REPORT_TYPE_NOTIF_DEVICE_UNPAIRED early enough and trigger the
    problem in one of the report forwarding functions called from
    logi_dj_raw_event().
    
    Fix this by performing the check at the earliest possible ocasion in
    logi_dj_raw_event().
