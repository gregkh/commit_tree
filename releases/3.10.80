    vfs: read file_handle only once in handle_to_path
    
    commit 161f873b89136eb1e69477c847d5a5033239d9ba upstream.
    
    We used to read file_handle twice.  Once to get the amount of extra
    bytes, and once to fetch the entire structure.
    
    This may be problematic since we do size verifications only after the
    first read, so if the number of extra bytes changes in userspace between
    the first and second calls, we'll have an incoherent view of
    file_handle.
    
    Instead, read the constant size once, and copy that over to the final
    structure without having to re-read it again.

    ACPI / init: Fix the ordering of acpi_reserve_resources()
    
    commit b9a5e5e18fbf223502c0b2264c15024e393da928 upstream.
    
    Since acpi_reserve_resources() is defined as a device_initcall(),
    there's no guarantee that it will be executed in the right order
    with respect to the rest of the ACPI initialization code.  On some
    systems this leads to breakage if, for example, the address range
    that should be reserved for the ACPI fixed registers is given to
    the PCI host bridge instead if the race is won by the wrong code
    path.
    
    Fix this by turning acpi_reserve_resources() into a void function
    and calling it directly from within the ACPI initialization sequence.

    Input: elantech - fix semi-mt protocol for v3 HW
    
    commit 3c0213d17a09601e0c6c0ae0e27caf70d988290f upstream.
    
    When the v3 hardware sees more than one finger, it uses the semi-mt
    protocol to report the touches. However, it currently works when
    num_fingers is 0, 1 or 2, but when it is 3 and above, it sends only 1
    finger as if num_fingers was 1.
    
    This confuses userspace which knows how to deal with extra fingers
    when all the slots are used, but not when some are missing.

    rtlwifi: rtl8192cu: Fix kernel deadlock
    
    commit 414b7e3b9ce8b0577f613e656fdbc36b34b444dd upstream.
    
    The USB mini-driver in rtlwifi, which is used by rtl8192cu, issues a call to
    usb_control_msg() with a timeout value of 0. In some instances where the
    interface is shutting down, this infinite wait results in a CPU deadlock. A
    one second timeout fixes this problem without affecting any normal operations.

    md/raid5: don't record new size if resize_stripes fails.
    
    commit 6e9eac2dcee5e19f125967dd2be3e36558c42fff upstream.
    
    If any memory allocation in resize_stripes fails we will return
    -ENOMEM, but in some cases we update conf->pool_size anyway.
    
    This means that if we try again, the allocations will be assumed
    to be larger than they are, and badness results.
    
    So only update pool_size if there is no error.
    
    This bug was introduced in 2.6.17 and the patch is suitable for
    -stable.

    svcrpc: fix potential GSSX_ACCEPT_SEC_CONTEXT decoding failures
    
    commit 9507271d960a1911a51683888837d75c171cd91f upstream.
    
    In an environment where the KDC is running Active Directory, the
    exported composite name field returned in the context could be large
    enough to span a page boundary.  Attaching a scratch buffer to the
    decoding xdr_stream helps deal with those cases.
    
    The case where we saw this was actually due to behavior that's been
    fixed in newer gss-proxy versions, but we're fixing it here too.

    ARM: fix missing syscall trace exit
    
    commit 1b97937246d8b97c0760d16d8992c7937bdf5e6a upstream.
    
    Josh Stone reports:
    
      I've discovered a case where both arm and arm64 will miss a ptrace
      syscall-exit that they should report.  If the syscall is entered
      without TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE set, then it goes on the fast path.  It's
      then possible to have TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE added in the middle of the
      syscall, but ret_fast_syscall doesn't check this flag again.
    
    Fix this by always checking for a syscall trace in the fast exit path.

    commit a29ef819f3f34f89a1b9b6a939b4c1cdfe1e85ce upstream.
    
    According to the imx27 documentation, fec has a 4 Kbyte
    memory space map. Moreover, the actual 16 Kbyte mapping
    overlaps the SCC (Security Controller) memory register
    space. So, we reduce the memory register space to 4 Kbyte.

    libata: Ignore spurious PHY event on LPM policy change
    
    commit 09c5b4803a80a5451d950d6a539d2eb311dc0fb1 upstream.
    
    When the LPM policy is set to ATA_LPM_MAX_POWER, the device might
    generate a spurious PHY event that cuases errors on the link.
    Ignore this event if it occured within 10s after the policy change.
    
    The timeout was chosen observing that on a Dell XPS13 9333 these
    spurious events can occur up to roughly 6s after the policy change.

    Most of kernel code assume that interface array in
    struct usb_configuration is NULL terminated.
    
    When gadget is composed with configfs configuration
    structure may be reused for different functions set.
    
    This bug happens because purge_configs_funcs() sets
    only next_interface_id to 0. Interface array still
    contains pointers to already freed interfaces. If in
    second try we add less interfaces than earlier we
    may access unallocated memory when trying to get
    interface descriptors.

    USB: visor: Match I330 phone more precisely
    
    commit 82ee3aeb9295c5fc37fd2ddf20f13ac2b40ec97d upstream.
    
    Samsung has just released a portable USB3 SSD, coming in a very small
    and nice form factor. It's USB ID is 04e8:8001, which unfortunately is
    already used by the Palm Visor driver for the Samsung I330 phone cradle.
    Having pl2303 or visor pick up this device ID results in conflicts with
    the usb-storage driver, which handles the newly released portable USB3
    SSD.
    
    To work around this conflict, I've dug up a mailing list post [1] from a
    long time ago, in which a user posts the full USB descriptor
    information. The most specific value in this appears to be the interface
    class, which has value 255 (0xff). Since usb-storage requires an
    interface class of 0x8, I believe it's correct to disambiguate the two
    devices by matching on 0xff inside visor.

    xhci: Solve full event ring by increasing TRBS_PER_SEGMENT to 256
    
    commit 18cc2f4cbbaf825a4fedcf2d60fd388d291e0a38 upstream.
    
    Our event ring consists of only one segment, and we risk filling
    the event ring in case we get isoc transfers with short intervals
    such as webcams that fill a TD every microframe (125us)
    
    With 64 TRB segment size one usb camera could fill the event ring in 8ms.
    A setup with several cameras and other devices can fill up the
    event ring as it is shared between all devices.
    This has occurred when uvcvideo queues 5 * 32TD URBs which then
    get cancelled when the video mode changes. The cancelled URBs are returned
    in the xhci interrupt context and blocks the interrupt handler from
    handling the new events.
    
    A full event ring will block xhci from scheduling traffic and affect all
    devices conneted to the xhci, will see errors such as Missed Service
    Intervals for isoc devices, and  and Split transaction errors for LS/FS
    interrupt devices.
    
    Increasing the TRB_PER_SEGMENT will also increase the default endpoint ring
    size, which is welcome as for most isoc transfer we had to dynamically
    expand the endpoint ring anyway to be able to queue the 5 * 32TDs uvcvideo
    queues.
    
    The default size used to be 64 TRBs per segment

    xhci: fix isoc endpoint dequeue from advancing too far on transaction error
    
    commit d104d0152a97fade389f47635b73a9ccc7295d0b upstream.
    
    Isoc TDs usually consist of one TRB, sometimes two. When all goes well we
    receive only one success event for a TD, and move the dequeue pointer to
    the next TD.
    
    This fails if the TD consists of two TRBs and we get a transfer error
    on the first TRB, we will then see two events for that TD.
    
    Fix this by making sure the event we get is for the last TRB in that TD
    before moving the dequeue pointer to the next TD. This will resolve some
    of the uvc and dvb issues with the
    "ERROR Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD" error message

    libceph: request a new osdmap if lingering request maps to no osd
    
    commit b0494532214bdfbf241e94fabab5dd46f7b82631 upstream.
    
    This commit does two things.  First, if there are any homeless
    lingering requests, we now request a new osdmap even if the osdmap that
    is being processed brought no changes, i.e. if a given lingering
    request turned homeless in one of the previous epochs and remained
    homeless in the current epoch.  Not doing so leaves us with a stale
    osdmap and as a result we may miss our window for reestablishing the
    watch and lose notifies.
    
    MON=1 OSD=1:
    
        # cat linger-needmap.sh
        #!/bin/bash
        rbd create --size 1 test
        DEV=$(rbd map test)
        ceph osd out 0
        rbd map dne/dne # obtain a new osdmap as a side effect (!)
        sleep 1
        ceph osd in 0
        rbd resize --size 2 test
        # rbd info test | grep size -> 2M
        # blockdev --getsize $DEV -> 1M
    
    N.B.: Not obtaining a new osdmap in between "osd out" and "osd in"
    above is enough to make it miss that resize notify, but that is a
    bug^Wlimitation of ceph watch/notify v1.
    
    Second, homeless lingering requests are now kicked just like those
    lingering requests whose mapping has changed.  This is mainly to
    recognize that a homeless lingering request makes no sense and to
    preserve the invariant that a registered lingering request is not
    sitting on any of r_req_lru_item lists.  This spares us a WARN_ON,
    which commit ba9d114ec557 ("libceph: clear r_req_lru_item in
    __unregister_linger_request()") tried to fix the _wrong_ way.

    lguest: fix out-by-one error in address checking.
    
    commit 83a35114d0e4583e6b0ca39502e68b6a92e2910c upstream.
    
    This bug has been there since day 1; addresses in the top guest physical
    page weren't considered valid.  You could map that page (the check in
    check_gpte() is correct), but if a guest tried to put a pagetable there
    we'd check that address manually when walking it, and kill the guest.

    fs, omfs: add NULL terminator in the end up the token list
    
    commit dcbff39da3d815f08750552fdd04f96b51751129 upstream.
    
    match_token() expects a NULL terminator at the end of the token list so
    that it would know where to stop.  Not having one causes it to overrun
    to invalid memory.
    
    In practice, passing a mount option that omfs didn't recognize would
    sometimes panic the system.

    net: socket: Fix the wrong returns for recvmsg and sendmsg
    
    Based on 08adb7dabd4874cc5666b4490653b26534702ce0 upstream.
    
    We found that after v3.10.73, recvmsg might return -EFAULT while -EINVAL
    was expected.
    
    We tested it through the recvmsg01 testcase come from LTP testsuit. It set
    msg->msg_namelen to -1 and the recvmsg syscall returned errno 14, which is
    unexpected (errno 22 is expected):
    
    recvmsg01    4  TFAIL  :  invalid socket length ; returned -1 (expected -1),
    errno 14 (expected 22)
    
    Linux mainline has no this bug for commit 08adb7dab fixes it accidentally.
    However, it is too large and complex to be backported to LTS 3.10.
    
    Commit 281c9c36 (net: compat: Update get_compat_msghdr() to match
    copy_msghdr_from_user() behaviour) made get_compat_msghdr() return
    error if msg_sys->msg_namelen was negative, which changed the behaviors
    of recvmsg and sendmsg syscall in a lib32 system:
    
    Before commit 281c9c36, get_compat_msghdr() wouldn't fail and it would
    return -EINVAL in move_addr_to_user() or somewhere if msg_sys->msg_namelen
    was invalid and then syscall returned -EINVAL, which is correct.
    
    And now, when msg_sys->msg_namelen is negative, get_compat_msghdr() will
    fail and wants to return -EINVAL, however, the outer syscall will return
    -EFAULT directly, which is unexpected.
    
    This patch gets the return value of get_compat_msghdr() as well as
    copy_msghdr_from_user(), then returns this expected value if
    get_compat_msghdr() fails.

    kernel: use the gnu89 standard explicitly
    
    commit 51b97e354ba9fce1890cf38ecc754aa49677fc89 upstream.
    
    Sasha Levin reports:
     "gcc5 changes the default standard to c11, which makes kernel build
      unhappy
    
      Explicitly define the kernel standard to be gnu89 which should keep
      everything working exactly like it was before gcc5"
    
    There are multiple small issues with the new default, but the biggest
    issue seems to be that the old - and very useful - GNU extension to
    allow a cast in front of an initializer has gone away.
    
    Patch updated by Kirill:
     "I'm pretty sure all gcc versions you can build kernel with supports
      -std=gnu89.  cc-option is redunrant.
    
      We also need to adjust HOSTCFLAGS otherwise allmodconfig fails for me"
    
    Note by Andrew Pinski:
     "Yes it was reported and both problems relating to this extension has
      been added to gnu99 and gnu11.  Though there are other issues with the
      kernel dealing with extern inline have different semantics between
      gnu89 and gnu99/11"
    
    End result: we may be able to move up to a newer stdc model eventually,
    but right now the newer models have some annoying deficiencies, so the
    traditional "gnu89" model ends up being the preferred one.

    rtllib_probe_req is defined as "static inline" in rtllib_softmac.c however it
    is declared differently as "extern inline" in rtllib_softmac.h. Since it isn't
    used outside of the scope of rtllib_softmac, it makes sense to remove the
    incorrect declaration.

    commit 0c9f3a65c5eb7fe1fc611a22eb8a8b71ea865998 upstream.
    
    The rtl8712 driver has an 'extern inline' function that contains an
    'if', which causes lots of warnings with CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES
    overriding the definition of 'if':
    
    drivers/staging/rtl8712/ieee80211.h:759:229: warning: '______f' is static but declared in inline function 'ieee80211_get_hdrlen' which is not static [enabled by default]
    
    This changes the driver to use 'static inline' instead, which happens
    to be the correct annotation anyway.

    With compilers which follow the C99 standard (like modern versions of gcc and
    clang), "extern inline" does the opposite thing from older versions of gcc
    (emits code for an externally linkable version of the inline function).
    
    "static inline" does the intended behavior in all cases instead.
