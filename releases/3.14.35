    x86, mm/ASLR: Fix stack randomization on 64-bit systems
    
    commit 4e7c22d447bb6d7e37bfe39ff658486ae78e8d77 upstream.
    
    The issue is that the stack for processes is not properly randomized on
    64 bit architectures due to an integer overflow.
    
    The affected function is randomize_stack_top() in file
    "fs/binfmt_elf.c":
    
      static unsigned long randomize_stack_top(unsigned long stack_top)
      {
               unsigned int random_variable = 0;
    
               if ((current->flags & PF_RANDOMIZE) &&
                       !(current->personality & ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE)) {
                       random_variable = get_random_int() & STACK_RND_MASK;
                       random_variable <<= PAGE_SHIFT;
               }
               return PAGE_ALIGN(stack_top) + random_variable;
               return PAGE_ALIGN(stack_top) - random_variable;
      }
    
    Note that, it declares the "random_variable" variable as "unsigned int".
    Since the result of the shifting operation between STACK_RND_MASK (which
    is 0x3fffff on x86_64, 22 bits) and PAGE_SHIFT (which is 12 on x86_64):
    
              random_variable <<= PAGE_SHIFT;
    
    then the two leftmost bits are dropped when storing the result in the
    "random_variable". This variable shall be at least 34 bits long to hold
    the (22+12) result.
    
    These two dropped bits have an impact on the entropy of process stack.
    Concretely, the total stack entropy is reduced by four: from 2^28 to
    2^30 (One fourth of expected entropy).
    
    This patch restores back the entropy by correcting the types involved
    in the operations in the functions randomize_stack_top() and
    stack_maxrandom_size().
    
    The successful fix can be tested with:
    
      $ for i in `seq 1 10`; do cat /proc/self/maps | grep stack; done
      7ffeda566000-7ffeda587000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      7fff5a332000-7fff5a353000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      7ffcdb7a1000-7ffcdb7c2000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      7ffd5e2c4000-7ffd5e2e5000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      ...
    
    Once corrected, the leading bytes should be between 7ffc and 7fff,
    rather than always being 7fff.

    blk-throttle: check stats_cpu before reading it from sysfs
    
    commit 045c47ca306acf30c740c285a77a4b4bda6be7c5 upstream.
    
    When reading blkio.throttle.io_serviced in a recently created blkio
    cgroup, it's possible to race against the creation of a throttle policy,
    which delays the allocation of stats_cpu.
    
    Like other functions in the throttle code, just checking for a NULL
    stats_cpu prevents the following oops caused by that race.

    btrfs: fix leak of path in btrfs_find_item
    
    commit 381cf6587f8a8a8e981bc0c1aaaa8859b51dc756 upstream.
    
    If btrfs_find_item is called with NULL path it allocates one locally but
    does not free it. Affected paths are inserting an orphan item for a file
    and for a subvol root.
    
    Move the path allocation to the callers.

    EDAC, amd64_edac: Prevent OOPS with >16 memory controllers
    
    commit 0c510cc83bdbaac8406f4f7caef34f4da0ba35ea upstream.
    
    When DRAM errors occur on memory controllers after EDAC_MAX_MCS (16),
    the kernel fatally dereferences unallocated structures, see splat below;
    this occurs on at least NumaConnect systems.
    
    Fix by checking if a memory controller info structure was found.

    md/raid1: fix read balance when a drive is write-mostly.
    
    commit d1901ef099c38afd11add4cfb3312c02ef21ec4a upstream.
    
    When a drive is marked write-mostly it should only be the
    target of reads if there is no other option.
    
    This behaviour was broken by
    
    commit 9dedf60313fa4dddfd5b9b226a0ef12a512bf9dc
        md/raid1: read balance chooses idlest disk for SSD
    
    which causes a write-mostly device to be *preferred* is some cases.
    
    Restore correct behaviour by checking and setting
    best_dist_disk and best_pending_disk rather than best_disk.
    
    We only need to test one of these as they are both changed
    from -1 or >=0 at the same time.
    
    As we leave min_pending and best_dist unchanged, any non-write-mostly
    device will appear better than the write-mostly device.

    md/raid5: Fix livelock when array is both resyncing and degraded.
    
    commit 26ac107378c4742978216be1005b7291b799c7b2 upstream.
    
    Commit a7854487cd7128a30a7f4f5259de9f67d5efb95f:
      md: When RAID5 is dirty, force reconstruct-write instead of read-modify-write.
    
    Causes an RCW cycle to be forced even when the array is degraded.
    A degraded array cannot support RCW as that requires reading all data
    blocks, and one may be missing.
    
    Forcing an RCW when it is not possible causes a live-lock and the code
    spins, repeatedly deciding to do something that cannot succeed.
    
    So change the condition to only force RCW on non-degraded arrays.

    metag: Fix KSTK_EIP() and KSTK_ESP() macros
    
    commit c2996cb29bfb73927a79dc96e598a718e843f01a upstream.
    
    The KSTK_EIP() and KSTK_ESP() macros should return the user program
    counter (PC) and stack pointer (A0StP) of the given task. These are used
    to determine which VMA corresponds to the user stack in
    /proc/<pid>/maps, and for the user PC & A0StP in /proc/<pid>/stat.
    
    However for Meta the PC & A0StP from the task's kernel context are used,
    resulting in broken output. For example in following /proc/<pid>/maps
    output, the 3afff000-3b021000 VMA should be described as the stack:
    
      # cat /proc/self/maps
      ...
      100b0000-100b1000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
      3afff000-3b021000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
    
    And in the following /proc/<pid>/stat output, the PC is in kernel code
    (1074234964 = 0x40078654) and the A0StP is in the kernel heap
    (1335981392 = 0x4fa17550):
    
      # cat /proc/self/stat
      51 (cat) R ... 1335981392 1074234964 ...
    
    Fix the definitions of KSTK_EIP() and KSTK_ESP() to use
    task_pt_regs(tsk)->ctx rather than (tsk)->thread.kernel_context. This
    gets the registers from the user context stored after the thread info at
    the base of the kernel stack, which is from the last entry into the
    kernel from userland, regardless of where in the kernel the task may
    have been interrupted, which results in the following more correct
    /proc/<pid>/maps output:
    
      # cat /proc/self/maps
      ...
      0800b000-08070000 r-xp 00000000 00:02 207        /lib/libuClibc-0.9.34-git.so
      ...
      100b0000-100b1000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
      3afff000-3b021000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [stack]
    
    And /proc/<pid>/stat now correctly reports the PC in libuClibc
    (134320308 = 0x80190b4) and the A0StP in the [stack] region (989864576 =
    0x3b002280):
    
      # cat /proc/self/stat
      51 (cat) R ... 989864576 134320308 ...

    xfs: Fix quota type in quota structures when reusing quota file
    
    commit dfcc70a8c868fe03276fa59864149708fb41930b upstream.
    
    For filesystems without separate project quota inode field in the
    superblock we just reuse project quota file for group quotas (and vice
    versa) if project quota file is allocated and we need group quota file.
    When we reuse the file, quota structures on disk suddenly have wrong
    type stored in d_flags though. Nobody really cares about this (although
    structure type reported to userspace was wrong as well) except
    that after commit 14bf61ffe6ac (quota: Switch ->get_dqblk() and
    ->set_dqblk() to use bytes as space units) assertion in
    xfs_qm_scall_getquota() started to trigger on xfs/106 test (apparently I
    was testing without XFS_DEBUG so I didn't notice when submitting the
    above commit).
    
    Fix the problem by properly resetting ddq->d_flags when running quotacheck
    for a quota file.

    arm64: compat Fix siginfo_t -> compat_siginfo_t conversion on big endian
    
    commit 9d42d48a342aee208c1154696196497fdc556bbf upstream.
    
    The native (64-bit) sigval_t union contains sival_int (32-bit) and
    sival_ptr (64-bit). When a compat application invokes a syscall that
    takes a sigval_t value (as part of a larger structure, e.g.
    compat_sys_mq_notify, compat_sys_timer_create), the compat_sigval_t
    union is converted to the native sigval_t with sival_int overlapping
    with either the least or the most significant half of sival_ptr,
    depending on endianness. When the corresponding signal is delivered to a
    compat application, on big endian the current (compat_uptr_t)sival_ptr
    cast always returns 0 since sival_int corresponds to the top part of
    sival_ptr. This patch fixes copy_siginfo_to_user32() so that sival_int
    is copied to the compat_siginfo_t structure.

    KVM: x86: update masterclock values on TSC writes
    
    commit 7f187922ddf6b67f2999a76dcb71663097b75497 upstream.
    
    When the guest writes to the TSC, the masterclock TSC copy must be
    updated as well along with the TSC_OFFSET update, otherwise a negative
    tsc_timestamp is calculated at kvm_guest_time_update.
    
    Once "if (!vcpus_matched && ka->use_master_clock)" is simplified to
    "if (ka->use_master_clock)", the corresponding "if (!ka->use_master_clock)"
    becomes redundant, so remove the do_request boolean and collapse
    everything into a single condition.

    KVM: MIPS: Don't leak FPU/DSP to guest
    
    commit f798217dfd038af981a18bbe4bc57027a08bb182 upstream.
    
    The FPU and DSP are enabled via the CP0 Status CU1 and MX bits by
    kvm_mips_set_c0_status() on a guest exit, presumably in case there is
    active state that needs saving if pre-emption occurs. However neither of
    these bits are cleared again when returning to the guest.
    
    This effectively gives the guest access to the FPU/DSP hardware after
    the first guest exit even though it is not aware of its presence,
    allowing FP instructions in guest user code to intermittently actually
    execute instead of trapping into the guest OS for emulation. It will
    then read & manipulate the hardware FP registers which technically
    belong to the user process (e.g. QEMU), or are stale from another user
    process. It can also crash the guest OS by causing an FP exception, for
    which a guest exception handler won't have been registered.
    
    First lets save and disable the FPU (and MSA) state with lose_fpu(1)
    before entering the guest. This simplifies the problem, especially for
    when guest FPU/MSA support is added in the future, and prevents FR=1 FPU
    state being live when the FR bit gets cleared for the guest, which
    according to the architecture causes the contents of the FPU and vector
    registers to become UNPREDICTABLE.
    
    We can then safely remove the enabling of the FPU in
    kvm_mips_set_c0_status(), since there should never be any active FPU or
    MSA state to save at pre-emption, which should plug the FPU leak.
    
    DSP state is always live rather than being lazily restored, so for that
    it is simpler to just clear the MX bit again when re-entering the guest.

    ARC: fix page address calculation if PAGE_OFFSET != LINUX_LINK_BASE
    
    commit 06f34e1c28f3608b0ce5b310e41102d3fe7b65a1 upstream.
    
    We used to calculate page address differently in 2 cases:
    
    1. In virt_to_page(x) we do
     --->8---
     mem_map + (x - CONFIG_LINUX_LINK_BASE) >> PAGE_SHIFT
     --->8---
    
    2. In in pte_page(x) we do
     --->8---
     mem_map + (pte_val(x) - PAGE_OFFSET) >> PAGE_SHIFT
     --->8---
    
    That leads to problems in case PAGE_OFFSET != CONFIG_LINUX_LINK_BASE -
    different pages will be selected depending on where and how we calculate
    page address.
    
    In particular in the STAR 9000853582 when gdb attempted to read memory
    of another process it got improper page in get_user_pages() because this
    is exactly one of the places where we search for a page by pte_page().
    
    The fix is trivial - we need to calculate page address similarly in both
    cases.

    ntp: Fixup adjtimex freq validation on 32-bit systems
    
    commit 29183a70b0b828500816bd794b3fe192fce89f73 upstream.
    
    Additional validation of adjtimex freq values to avoid
    potential multiplication overflows were added in commit
    5e5aeb4367b (time: adjtimex: Validate the ADJ_FREQUENCY values)
    
    Unfortunately the patch used LONG_MAX/MIN instead of
    LLONG_MAX/MIN, which was fine on 64-bit systems, but being
    much smaller on 32-bit systems caused false positives
    resulting in most direct frequency adjustments to fail w/
    EINVAL.
    
    ntpd only does direct frequency adjustments at startup, so
    the issue was not as easily observed there, but other time
    sync applications like ptpd and chrony were more effected by
    the bug.
    
    See bugs:
    
      https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92481
      https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1188074
    
    This patch changes the checks to use LLONG_MAX for
    clarity, and additionally the checks are disabled
    on 32-bit systems since LLONG_MAX/PPM_SCALE is always
    larger then the 32-bit long freq value, so multiplication
    overflows aren't possible there.

    kdb: fix incorrect counts in KDB summary command output
    
    commit 146755923262037fc4c54abc28c04b1103f3cc51 upstream.
    
    The output of KDB 'summary' command should report MemTotal, MemFree
    and Buffers output in kB. Current codes report in unit of pages.
    
    A define of K(x) as
    is defined in the code, but not used.
    
    This patch would apply the define to convert the values to kB.

    ARM: pxa: add regulator_has_full_constraints to poodle board file
    
    commit 9bc78f32c2e430aebf6def965b316aa95e37a20c upstream.
    
    Add regulator_has_full_constraints() call to poodle board file to let
    regulator core know that we do not have any additional regulators left.
    This lets it substitute unprovided regulators with dummy ones.
    
    This fixes the following warnings that can be seen on poodle if
    regulators are enabled:
    
    ads7846 spi1.0: unable to get regulator: -517

    usb: core: buffer: smallest buffer should start at ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN
    
    commit 5efd2ea8c9f4f12916ffc8ba636792ce052f6911 upstream.
    
    the following error pops up during "testusb -a -t 10"
    | musb-hdrc musb-hdrc.1.auto: dma_pool_free buffer-128, f134e000/be842000 (bad dma)
    hcd_buffer_create() creates a few buffers, the smallest has 32 bytes of
    size. ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is set to 64 bytes. This combo results in
    hcd_buffer_alloc() returning memory which is 32 bytes aligned and it
    might by identified by buffer_offset() as another buffer. This means the
    buffer which is on a 32 byte boundary will not get freed, instead it
    tries to free another buffer with the error message.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by creating the smallest DMA buffer with the
    size of ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN (or 32 in case ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is
    smaller). This might be 32, 64 or even 128 bytes. The next three pools
    will have the size 128, 512 and 2048.
    In case the smallest pool is 128 bytes then we have only three pools
    instead of four (and zero the first entry in the array).
    The last pool size is always 2048 bytes which is the assumed PAGE_SIZE /
    2 of 4096. I doubt it makes sense to continue using PAGE_SIZE / 2 where
    we would end up with 8KiB buffer in case we have 16KiB pages.
    Instead I think it makes sense to have a common size(s) and extend them
    if there is need to.
    There is a BUILD_BUG_ON() now in case someone has a minalign of more than
    128 bytes.

    USB: fix use-after-free bug in usb_hcd_unlink_urb()
    
    commit c99197902da284b4b723451c1471c45b18537cde upstream.
    
    The usb_hcd_unlink_urb() routine in hcd.c contains two possible
    use-after-free errors.  The dev_dbg() statement at the end of the
    routine dereferences urb and urb->dev even though both structures may
    have been deallocated.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by storing urb->dev in a local variable
    (avoiding the dereference of urb) and moving the dev_dbg() up before
    the usb_put_dev() call.

    tty/serial: at91: fix error handling in atmel_serial_probe()
    
    commit 6fbb9bdf0f3fbe23aeff806489791aa876adaffb upstream.
    
    -EDEFER error wasn't handle properly by atmel_serial_probe().
    As an example, when atmel_serial_probe() is called for the first time, we pass
    the test_and_set_bit() test to check whether the port has already been
    initalized. Then we call atmel_init_port(), which may return -EDEFER, possibly
    returned before by clk_get(). Consequently atmel_serial_probe() used to return
    this error code WITHOUT clearing the port bit in the "atmel_ports_in_use" mask.
    When atmel_serial_probe() was called for the second time, it used to fail on
    the test_and_set_bit() function then returning -EBUSY.
    
    When atmel_serial_probe() fails, this patch make it clear the port bit in the
    "atmel_ports_in_use" mask, if needed, before returning the error code.

    cfq-iosched: fix incorrect filing of rt async cfqq
    
    commit c6ce194325cef342313e3d27620411ce90a89c50 upstream.
    
    Hi,
    
    If you can manage to submit an async write as the first async I/O from
    the context of a process with realtime scheduling priority, then a
    cfq_queue is allocated, but filed into the wrong async_cfqq bucket.  It
    ends up in the best effort array, but actually has realtime I/O
    scheduling priority set in cfqq->ioprio.
    
    The reason is that cfq_get_queue assumes the default scheduling class and
    priority when there is no information present (i.e. when the async cfqq
    is created):
    
    static struct cfq_queue *
    cfq_get_queue(struct cfq_data *cfqd, bool is_sync, struct cfq_io_cq *cic,
                  struct bio *bio, gfp_t gfp_mask)
    {
            const int ioprio_class = IOPRIO_PRIO_CLASS(cic->ioprio);
            const int ioprio = IOPRIO_PRIO_DATA(cic->ioprio);
    
    cic->ioprio starts out as 0, which is "invalid".  So, class of 0
    (IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE) is passed to cfq_async_queue_prio like so:
    
                    async_cfqq = cfq_async_queue_prio(cfqd, ioprio_class, ioprio);
    
    static struct cfq_queue **
    cfq_async_queue_prio(struct cfq_data *cfqd, int ioprio_class, int ioprio)
    {
            switch (ioprio_class) {
            case IOPRIO_CLASS_RT:
                    return &cfqd->async_cfqq[0][ioprio];
            case IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE:
                    ioprio = IOPRIO_NORM;
                    /* fall through */
            case IOPRIO_CLASS_BE:
                    return &cfqd->async_cfqq[1][ioprio];
            case IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE:
                    return &cfqd->async_idle_cfqq;
            default:
                    BUG();
            }
    }
    
    Here, instead of returning a class mapped from the process' scheduling
    priority, we get back the bucket associated with IOPRIO_CLASS_BE.
    
    Now, there is no queue allocated there yet, so we create it:
    
                    cfqq = cfq_find_alloc_queue(cfqd, is_sync, cic, bio, gfp_mask);
    
    That function ends up doing this:
    
                            cfq_init_cfqq(cfqd, cfqq, current->pid, is_sync);
                            cfq_init_prio_data(cfqq, cic);
    
    cfq_init_cfqq marks the priority as having changed.  Then, cfq_init_prio
    data does this:
    
            ioprio_class = IOPRIO_PRIO_CLASS(cic->ioprio);
            switch (ioprio_class) {
            default:
                    printk(KERN_ERR "cfq: bad prio %x\n", ioprio_class);
            case IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE:
                    /*
                     * no prio set, inherit CPU scheduling settings
                     */
                    cfqq->ioprio = task_nice_ioprio(tsk);
                    cfqq->ioprio_class = task_nice_ioclass(tsk);
                    break;
    
    So we basically have two code paths that treat IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE
    differently, which results in an RT async cfqq filed into a best effort
    bucket.
    
    Attached is a patch which fixes the problem.  I'm not sure how to make
    it cleaner.  Suggestions would be welcome.

    cfq-iosched: handle failure of cfq group allocation
    
    commit 69abaffec7d47a083739b79e3066cb3730eba72e upstream.
    
    Cfq_lookup_create_cfqg() allocates struct blkcg_gq using GFP_ATOMIC.
    In cfq_find_alloc_queue() possible allocation failure is not handled.
    As a result kernel oopses on NULL pointer dereference when
    cfq_link_cfqq_cfqg() calls cfqg_get() for NULL pointer.
    
    Bug was introduced in v3.5 in commit cd1604fab4f9 ("blkcg: factor
    out blkio_group creation"). Prior to that commit cfq group lookup
    had returned pointer to root group as fallback.
    
    This patch handles this error using existing fallback oom_cfqq.

    iscsi-target: Drop problematic active_ts_list usage
    
    commit 3fd7b60f2c7418239d586e359e0c6d8503e10646 upstream.
    
    This patch drops legacy active_ts_list usage within iscsi_target_tq.c
    code.  It was originally used to track the active thread sets during
    iscsi-target shutdown, and is no longer used by modern upstream code.
    
    Two people have reported list corruption using traditional iscsi-target
    and iser-target with the following backtrace, that appears to be related
    to iscsi_thread_set->ts_list being used across both active_ts_list and
    inactive_ts_list.

    Added Little Endian support to vtpm module
    
    commit eb71f8a5e33fa1066fb92f0111ab366a341e1f6c upstream.
    
    The tpm_ibmvtpm module is affected by an unaligned access problem.
    ibmvtpm_crq_get_version failed with rc=-4 during boot when vTPM is
    enabled in Power partition, which supports both little endian and
    big endian modes.
    
    We added little endian support to fix this problem:
    1) added cpu_to_be64 calls to ensure BE data is sent from an LE OS.
    2) added be16_to_cpu and be32_to_cpu calls to make sure data received
       is in LE format on a LE OS.

    tpm/tpm_i2c_stm_st33: Fix potential bug in tpm_stm_i2c_send
    
    commit 1ba3b0b6f218072afe8372d12f1b6bf26a26008e upstream.
    
    When sending data in tpm_stm_i2c_send, each loop iteration send buf.
    Send buf + i instead as the goal of this for loop is to send a number
    of byte from buf that fit in burstcnt. Once those byte are sent, we are
    supposed to send the next ones.
    
    The driver was working because the burstcount value returns always the maximum size for a TPM
    command or response. (0x800 for a command and 0x400 for a response).

    tpm: Fix NULL return in tpm_ibmvtpm_get_desired_dma
    
    commit 84eb186bc37c0900b53077ca21cf6dd15823a232 upstream.
    
    There was an oops in tpm_ibmvtpm_get_desired_dma, which caused
    kernel panic during boot when vTPM is enabled in Power partition
    configured in AMS mode.
    
    vio_bus_probe calls vio_cmo_bus_probe which calls
    tpm_ibmvtpm_get_desired_dma to get the size needed for DMA allocation.
    The problem is, vio_cmo_bus_probe is called before calling probe, which
    for vtpm is tpm_ibmvtpm_probe and it's this function that initializes
    and sets up vtpm's CRQ and gets required data values.  Therefore,
    since this has not yet been done, NULL is returned in attempt to get
    the size for DMA allocation.
    
    We added a NULL check.  In addition, a default buffer size will
    be set when NULL is returned.

    commit 448e9c55c12d6bd4fa90a7e31d802e045666d7c8 upstream.
    
    Some machines, such as the Acer C720 and Toshiba CB35, have TPMs that do
    not send IRQs while also having an ACPI TPM entry indicating that they
    will be sent. These machines freeze on resume while the tpm_tis module
    waits for an IRQ, eventually timing out.
    
    When in interrupt mode, the tpm_tis module should receive an IRQ during
    module init. Fall back to polling mode if none is received when expected.

    Commit 6edb2a8a385f0cdef51dae37ff23e74d76d8a6ce introduced
    an array map_pages that contains the addresses returned by

    is unmapped before map_pages[1], breaking the nesting requirement
    as specified in the documentation for kmap_atomic/kunmap_atomic.
    
    This was caught by the highmem debug code present in kunmap_atomic.
    Fix the loop to do the unmapping properly.

    mm/hugetlb: pmd_huge() returns true for non-present hugepage
    
    commit cbef8478bee55775ac312a574aad48af7bb9cf9f upstream.
    
    Migrating hugepages and hwpoisoned hugepages are considered as non-present
    hugepages, and they are referenced via migration entries and hwpoison
    entries in their page table slots.
    
    This behavior causes race condition because pmd_huge() doesn't tell
    non-huge pages from migrating/hwpoisoned hugepages.  follow_page_mask() is
    one example where the kernel would call follow_page_pte() for such
    hugepage while this function is supposed to handle only normal pages.
    
    To avoid this, this patch makes pmd_huge() return true when pmd_none() is
    true *and* pmd_present() is false.  We don't have to worry about mixing up
    non-present pmd entry with normal pmd (pointing to leaf level pte entry)
    because pmd_present() is true in normal pmd.
    
    The same race condition could happen in (x86-specific) gup_pmd_range(),
    where this patch simply adds pmd_present() check instead of pmd_huge().
    This is because gup_pmd_range() is fast path.  If we have non-present
    hugepage in this function, we will go into gup_huge_pmd(), then return 0
    at flag mask check, and finally fall back to the slow path.

    nfs41_callback_svc does most of its work while in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE,
    which is just wrong. Fix that by finishing the wait immediately if we've
    found that the list has something on it.
    
    Also, we don't expect this kthread to accept signals, so we should be
    using a TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE sleep instead. That however, opens us up
    hung task warnings from the watchdog, so have the schedule_timeout
    wake up every 60s if there's no callback activity.

    mmc: sdhci-pxav3: fix setting of pdata->clk_delay_cycles
    
    commit 14460dbaf7a5a0488963fdb8232ad5c8a8cca7b7 upstream.
    
    Current code checks "clk_delay_cycles > 0" to know whether the optional
    "mrvl,clk_delay_cycles" is set or not. But of_property_read_u32() doesn't
    touch clk_delay_cycles if the property is not set. And type of
    clk_delay_cycles is u32, so we may always set pdata->clk_delay_cycles as a
    random value.
    
    This patch fix this problem by check the return value of of_property_read_u32()
    to know whether the optional clk-delay-cycles is set or not.

    enable_irq_wakeup returns 0 in case it correctly enabled the IRQ to
    generate the wakeup event (and thus resume should call disable_irq_wake).
    Currently gpio-charger driver has this logic inverted. Correct that thus

    commit 478913fdbdfd4a781d91c993eb86838620fe7421 upstream.
    
    The driver mismatched 'num_supplicants' with 'num_supplies' of
    power_supply structure.
    
    It provided list of supplicants (power_supply.supplied_to) but did
    not set the number of supplicants. Instead it set the num_supplies which
    is used when iterating over number of supplies (power_supply.supplied_from).
    
    As a result the list of supplicants was ignored by core because its size
    was 0.

    libceph: fix double __remove_osd() problem
    
    commit 7eb71e0351fbb1b242ae70abb7bb17107fe2f792 upstream.
    
    It turns out it's possible to get __remove_osd() called twice on the
    same OSD.  That doesn't sit well with rb_erase() - depending on the
    shape of the tree we can get a NULL dereference, a soft lockup or
    a random crash at some point in the future as we end up touching freed
    memory.  One scenario that I was able to reproduce is as follows:
    
                <osd3 is idle, on the osd lru list>
    <con reset - osd3>
    con_fault_finish()
      osd_reset()
                                  <osdmap - osd3 down>
                                  ceph_osdc_handle_map()
                                    <takes map_sem>
                                    kick_requests()
                                      <takes request_mutex>
                                      reset_changed_osds()
                                        __reset_osd()
                                          __remove_osd()
                                      <releases request_mutex>
                                    <releases map_sem>
        <takes map_sem>
        <takes request_mutex>
        __kick_osd_requests()
          __reset_osd()
            __remove_osd() <-- !!!
    
    A case can be made that osd refcounting is imperfect and reworking it
    would be a proper resolution, but for now Sage and I decided to fix
    this by adding a safe guard around __remove_osd().

    RME RayDAT and AIO use a fixed buffer size of 16384 samples. With period

    ALSA: off by one bug in snd_riptide_joystick_probe()
    
    commit e4940626defdf6c92da1052ad3f12741c1a28c90 upstream.
    
    The problem here is that we check:
    
            if (dev >= SNDRV_CARDS)
    
    Then we increment "dev".
    
           if (!joystick_port[dev++])
    
    Then we use it as an offset into a array with SNDRV_CARDS elements.
    
            if (!request_region(joystick_port[dev], 8, "Riptide gameport")) {
    
    This has 3 effects:
    1) If you use the module option to specify the joystick port then it has
       to be shifted one space over.
    2) The wrong error message will be printed on failure if you have over
       32 cards.
    3) Static checkers will correctly complain that are off by one.

    xen/manage: Fix USB interaction issues when resuming
    
    commit 72978b2fe2f2cdf9f319c6c6dcdbe92b38de2be2 upstream.
    
    Commit 61a734d305e1 ("xen/manage: Always freeze/thaw processes when
    suspend/resuming") ensured that userspace processes were always frozen
    before suspending to reduce interaction issues when resuming devices.
    However, freeze_processes() does not freeze kernel threads.  Freeze
    kernel threads as well to prevent deadlocks with the khubd thread when
    resuming devices.
    
    This is what native suspend and resume does.

    cpufreq: s3c: remove incorrect __init annotations
    
    commit 61882b63171736571e1139ab5aa929e3bb336016 upstream.
    
    The two functions s3c2416_cpufreq_driver_init and s3c_cpufreq_register
    are marked init but are called from a context that might be run after
    the __init sections are discarded, as the compiler points out:
    
    WARNING: vmlinux.o(.data+0x1ad9dc): Section mismatch in reference from the variable s3c2416_cpufreq_driver to the function .init.text:s3c2416_cpufreq_driver_init()
    WARNING: drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x35b5dc): Section mismatch in reference from the function s3c2410a_cpufreq_add() to the function .init.text:s3c_cpufreq_register()
    
    This removes the __init markings.

    cpufreq: speedstep-smi: enable interrupts when waiting
    
    commit d4d4eda23794c701442e55129dd4f8f2fefd5e4d upstream.
    
    On Dell Latitude C600 laptop with Pentium 3 850MHz processor, the
    speedstep-smi driver sometimes loads and sometimes doesn't load with
    "change to state X failed" message.
    
    The hardware sometimes refuses to change frequency and in this case, we
    need to retry later. I found out that we need to enable interrupts while
    waiting. When we enable interrupts, the hardware blockage that prevents
    frequency transition resolves and the transition is possible. With
    disabled interrupts, the blockage doesn't resolve (no matter how long do
    we wait). The exact reasons for this hardware behavior are unknown.
    
    This patch enables interrupts in the function speedstep_set_state that can
    be called with disabled interrupts. However, this function is called with
    disabled interrupts only from speedstep_get_freqs, so it shouldn't cause
    any problem.

    cpufreq: Set cpufreq_cpu_data to NULL before putting kobject
    
    commit 6ffae8c06fab058d6c3f8ecb7f921327721034e7 upstream.
    
    In __cpufreq_remove_dev_finish(), per-cpu 'cpufreq_cpu_data' needs
    to be cleared before calling kobject_put(&policy->kobj) and under
    cpufreq_driver_lock. Otherwise, if someone else calls cpufreq_cpu_get()
    in parallel with it, they can obtain a non-NULL policy from that after
    kobject_put(&policy->kobj) was executed.
    
    Consider this case:
    
    Thread A                                Thread B
    cpufreq_cpu_get()
      acquire cpufreq_driver_lock
      read-per-cpu cpufreq_cpu_data
                                            kobject_put(&policy->kobj);
      kobject_get(&policy->kobj);
                                            ...
                                            per_cpu(&cpufreq_cpu_data, cpu) = NULL
    
    And this will result in a warning like this one:

    The actual code flow is as follows:
    
     Thread A: Workqueue: kacpi_notify
    
     acpi_processor_notify()
       acpi_processor_ppc_has_changed()
             cpufreq_update_policy()
               cpufreq_cpu_get()
                 kobject_get()
    
     Thread B: xenbus_thread()
    
     xenbus_thread()
       msg->u.watch.handle->callback()
         handle_vcpu_hotplug_event()
           vcpu_hotplug()

                 cpufreq_cpu_callback()
                   __cpufreq_remove_dev_finish()
                     cpufreq_policy_put_kobj()
                       kobject_put()
    
    cpufreq_cpu_get() gets the policy from per-cpu variable cpufreq_cpu_data
    under cpufreq_driver_lock, and once it gets a valid policy it expects it
    to not be freed until cpufreq_cpu_put() is called.
    
    But the race happens when another thread puts the kobject first and updates
    cpufreq_cpu_data before or later. And so the first thread gets a valid policy
    structure and before it does kobject_get() on it, the second one has already
    done kobject_put().
    
    Fix this by setting cpufreq_cpu_data to NULL before putting the kobject and that
    too under locks.

    PCI: Fix infinite loop with ROM image of size 0
    
    commit 16b036af31e1456cb69243a5a0c9ef801ecd1f17 upstream.
    
    If the image size would ever read as 0, pci_get_rom_size() could keep
    processing the same image over and over again.  Exit the loop if we ever
    read a length of zero.
    
    This fixes a soft lockup on boot when the radeon driver calls
    pci_get_rom_size() on an AMD Radeon R7 250X PCIe discrete graphics card.

    PCI: Generate uppercase hex for modalias var in uevent
    
    commit 145b3fe579db66fbe999a2bc3fd5b63dffe9636d upstream.
    
    Some implementations of modprobe fail to load the driver for a PCI device
    automatically because the "interface" part of the modalias from the kernel
    is lowercase, and the modalias from file2alias is uppercase.
    
    The "interface" is the low-order byte of the Class Code, defined in PCI
    r3.0, Appendix D.  Most interface types defined in the spec do not use
    alpha characters, so they won't be affected.  For example, 00h, 01h, 10h,
    20h, etc. are unaffected.
    
    Print the "interface" byte of the Class Code in uppercase hex, as we
    already do for the Vendor ID, Device ID, Class, etc.
    
    Commit 89ec3dcf17fd ("PCI: Generate uppercase hex for modalias interface
    class") fixed only half of the problem.  Some udev implementations rely on
    the uevent file and not the modalias file.

    HID: i2c-hid: Limit reads to wMaxInputLength bytes for input events
    
    commit 6d00f37e49d95e640a3937a4a1ae07dbe92a10cb upstream.
    
    d1c7e29e8d27 (HID: i2c-hid: prevent buffer overflow in early IRQ)
    changed hid_get_input() to read ihid->bufsize bytes, which can be
    more than wMaxInputLength. This is the case with the Dell XPS 13
    9343, and it is causing events to be missed. In some cases the
    missed events are releases, which can cause the cursor to jump or
    freeze, among other problems. Limit the number of bytes read to
    min(wMaxInputLength, ihid->bufsize) to prevent such problems.

    iwlwifi: mvm: always use mac color zero
    
    commit 5523d11cc46393a1e61b7ef4a0b2d4e7ed9521e4 upstream.
    
    We don't really need to use different mac colors when adding mac
    contexts, because they're not used anywhere.  In fact, the firmware
    doesn't accept 255 as a valid color, so we get into a SYSASSERT 0x3401
    when we reach that.
    
    Remove the color increment to use always zero and avoid reaching 255.

    iwlwifi: pcie: disable the SCD_BASE_ADDR when we resume from WoWLAN
    
    commit cd8f438405032ac8ff88bd8f2eca5e0c0063b14b upstream.
    
    The base address of the scheduler in the device's memory
    (SRAM) comes from two different sources. The periphery
    register and the alive notification from the firmware.
    We have a check in iwl_pcie_tx_start that ensures that
    they are the same.
    When we resume from WoWLAN, the firmware may have crashed
    for whatever reason. In that case, the whole device may be
    reset which means that the periphery register will hold a
    meaningless value. When we come to compare
    trans_pcie->scd_base_addr (which really holds the value we
    had when we loaded the WoWLAN firmware upon suspend) and
    the current value of the register, we don't see a match
    unsurprisingly.
    Trick the check to avoid a loud yet harmless WARN.
    Note that when the WoWLAN has crashed, we will see that
    in iwl_trans_pcie_d3_resume which will let the op_mode
    know. Once the op_mode is informed that the WowLAN firmware
    has crashed, it can't do much besides resetting the whole
    device.

    fsnotify: fix handling of renames in audit
    
    commit 6ee8e25fc3e916193bce4ebb43d5439e1e2144ab upstream.
    
    Commit e9fd702a58c4 ("audit: convert audit watches to use fsnotify
    instead of inotify") broke handling of renames in audit.  Audit code
    wants to update inode number of an inode corresponding to watched name
    in a directory.  When something gets renamed into a directory to a
    watched name, inotify previously passed moved inode to audit code
    however new fsnotify code passes directory inode where the change
    happened.  That confuses audit and it starts watching parent directory
    instead of a file in a directory.
    
    This can be observed for example by doing:
    
      cd /tmp
      touch foo bar
      auditctl -w /tmp/foo
      touch foo
      mv bar foo
      touch foo
    
    In audit log we see events like:
    
      type=CONFIG_CHANGE msg=audit(1423563584.155:90): auid=1000 ses=2 op="updated rules" path="/tmp/foo" key=(null) list=4 res=1
      ...
      type=PATH msg=audit(1423563584.155:91): item=2 name="bar" inode=1046884 dev=08:0 2 mode=0100644 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 nametype=DELETE
      type=PATH msg=audit(1423563584.155:91): item=3 name="foo" inode=1046842 dev=08:0 2 mode=0100644 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 nametype=DELETE
      type=PATH msg=audit(1423563584.155:91): item=4 name="foo" inode=1046884 dev=08:0 2 mode=0100644 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 nametype=CREATE
      ...
    
    and that's it - we see event for the first touch after creating the
    audit rule, we see events for rename but we don't see any event for the
    last touch.  However we start seeing events for unrelated stuff
    happening in /tmp.
    
    Fix the problem by passing moved inode as data in the FS_MOVED_FROM and
    FS_MOVED_TO events instead of the directory where the change happens.
    This doesn't introduce any new problems because noone besides
    audit_watch.c cares about the passed value:
    
      fs/notify/fanotify/fanotify.c cares only about FSNOTIFY_EVENT_PATH events.
      fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c doesn't care about passed 'data' value at all.
      fs/notify/inotify/inotify_fsnotify.c uses 'data' only for FSNOTIFY_EVENT_PATH.
      kernel/audit_tree.c doesn't care about passed 'data' at all.
      kernel/audit_watch.c expects moved inode as 'data'.

    xfs: set superblock buffer type correctly
    
    commit 3443a3bca54588f43286b725d8648d33a38c86f1 upstream.
    
    When the superblock is modified in a transaction, the commonly
    modified fields are not actually copied to the superblock buffer to
    avoid the buffer lock becoming a serialisation point. However, there
    are some other operations that modify the superblock fields within
    the transaction that don't directly log to the superblock but rely
    on the changes to be applied during the transaction commit (to
    minimise the buffer lock hold time).
    
    When we do this, we fail to mark the buffer log item as being a
    superblock buffer and that can lead to the buffer not being marked
    with the corect type in the log and hence causing recovery issues.
    Fix it by setting the type correctly, similar to xfs_mod_sb()...

    xfs: inode unlink does not set AGI buffer type
    
    commit f19b872b086711bb4b22c3a0f52f16aa920bcc61 upstream.
    
    This leads to log recovery throwing errors like:
    
    XFS (md0): Mounting V5 Filesystem
    XFS (md0): Starting recovery (logdev: internal)
    XFS (md0): Unknown buffer type 0!
    XFS (md0): _xfs_buf_ioapply: no ops on block 0xaea8802/0x1
    ffff8800ffc53800: 58 41 47 49 .....
    
    Which is the AGI buffer magic number.
    
    Ensure that we set the type appropriately in both unlink list
    addition and removal.

    xfs: ensure buffer types are set correctly
    
    commit 0d612fb570b71ea2e49554a770cff4c489018b2c upstream.
    
    Jan Kara reported that log recovery was finding buffers with invalid
    types in them. This should not happen, and indicates a bug in the
    logging of buffers. To catch this, add asserts to the buffer
    formatting code to ensure that the buffer type is in range when the
    transaction is committed.
    
    We don't set a type on buffers being marked stale - they are not
    going to get replayed, the format item exists only for recovery to
    be able to prevent replay of the buffer, so the type does not
    matter. Hence that needs special casing here.

    Bluetooth: ath3k: workaround the compatibility issue with xHCI controller
    
    commit c561a5753dd631920c4459a067d22679b3d110d6 upstream.
    
    BugLink: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1400215
    
    ath3k devices fail to load firmwares on xHCI buses, but work well on
    EHCI, this might be a compatibility issue between xHCI and ath3k chips.
    As my testing result, those chips will work on xHCI buses again with
    this patch.
    
    This workaround is from Qualcomm, they also did some workarounds in
    Windows driver.
