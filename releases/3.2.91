    ALSA: timer: Fix missing queue indices reset at SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_SELECT
    
    commit ba3021b2c79b2fa9114f92790a99deb27a65b728 upstream.
    
    snd_timer_user_tselect() reallocates the queue buffer dynamically, but
    it forgot to reset its indices.  Since the read may happen
    concurrently with ioctl and snd_timer_user_tselect() allocates the
    buffer via kmalloc(), this may lead to the leak of uninitialized
    kernel-space data, as spotted via KMSAN:

    ALSA: timer: Fix race between read and ioctl
    
    commit d11662f4f798b50d8c8743f433842c3e40fe3378 upstream.
    
    The read from ALSA timer device, the function snd_timer_user_tread(),
    may access to an uninitialized struct snd_timer_user fields when the
    read is concurrently performed while the ioctl like
    snd_timer_user_tselect() is invoked.  We have already fixed the races
    among ioctls via a mutex, but we seem to have forgotten the race
    between read vs ioctl.
    
    This patch simply applies (more exactly extends the already applied
    range of) tu->ioctl_lock in snd_timer_user_tread() for closing the
    race window.

    fs/exec.c: account for argv/envp pointers
    
    commit 98da7d08850fb8bdeb395d6368ed15753304aa0c upstream.
    
    When limiting the argv/envp strings during exec to 1/4 of the stack limit,
    the storage of the pointers to the strings was not included.  This means
    that an exec with huge numbers of tiny strings could eat 1/4 of the stack
    limit in strings and then additional space would be later used by the
    pointers to the strings.
    
    For example, on 32-bit with a 8MB stack rlimit, an exec with 1677721
    single-byte strings would consume less than 2MB of stack, the max (8MB /
    4) amount allowed, but the pointers to the strings would consume the
    remaining additional stack space (1677721 * 4 == 6710884).
    
    The result (1677721 + 6710884 == 8388605) would exhaust stack space
    entirely.  Controlling this stack exhaustion could result in
    pathological behavior in setuid binaries (CVE-2017-1000365).

    mm: Tighten x86 /dev/mem with zeroing reads
    
    commit a4866aa812518ed1a37d8ea0c881dc946409de94 upstream.
    
    Under CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, reading System RAM through /dev/mem is
    disallowed. However, on x86, the first 1MB was always allowed for BIOS
    and similar things, regardless of it actually being System RAM. It was
    possible for heap to end up getting allocated in low 1MB RAM, and then
    read by things like x86info or dd, which would trip hardened usercopy:
    
    usercopy: kernel memory exposure attempt detected from ffff880000090000 (dma-kmalloc-256) (4096 bytes)
    
    This changes the x86 exception for the low 1MB by reading back zeros for
    System RAM areas instead of blindly allowing them. More work is needed to
    extend this to mmap, but currently mmap doesn't go through usercopy, so
    hardened usercopy won't Oops the kernel.

    mac80211: reject ToDS broadcast data frames
    
    commit 3018e947d7fd536d57e2b550c33e456d921fff8c upstream.
    
    AP/AP_VLAN modes don't accept any real 802.11 multicast data
    frames, but since they do need to accept broadcast management
    frames the same is currently permitted for data frames. This
    opens a security problem because such frames would be decrypted
    with the GTK, and could even contain unicast L3 frames.
    
    Since the spec says that ToDS frames must always have the BSSID
    as the RA (addr1), reject any other data frames.
    
    The problem was originally reported in "Predicting, Decrypting,
    and Abusing WPA2/802.11 Group Keys" at usenix
    https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/vanhoef

    ring-buffer: Have ring_buffer_iter_empty() return true when empty
    
    commit 78f7a45dac2a2d2002f98a3a95f7979867868d73 upstream.
    
    I noticed that reading the snapshot file when it is empty no longer gives a
    status. It suppose to show the status of the snapshot buffer as well as how
    to allocate and use it. For example:
    
     ># cat snapshot
     # tracer: nop
     #
     #
     # * Snapshot is allocated *
     #
     # Snapshot commands:
     # echo 0 > snapshot : Clears and frees snapshot buffer
     # echo 1 > snapshot : Allocates snapshot buffer, if not already allocated.
     #                      Takes a snapshot of the main buffer.
     # echo 2 > snapshot : Clears snapshot buffer (but does not allocate or free)
     #                      (Doesn't have to be '2' works with any number that
     #                       is not a '0' or '1')
    
    But instead it just showed an empty buffer:
    
     ># cat snapshot
     # tracer: nop
     #
     # entries-in-buffer/entries-written: 0/0   #P:4
     #
     #                              _-----=> irqs-off
     #                             / _----=> need-resched
     #                            | / _---=> hardirq/softirq
     #                            || / _--=> preempt-depth
     #                            ||| /     delay

     #              | |       |   ||||       |         |
    
    What happened was that it was using the ring_buffer_iter_empty() function to
    see if it was empty, and if it was, it showed the status. But that function
    was returning false when it was empty. The reason was that the iter header
    page was on the reader page, and the reader page was empty, but so was the
    buffer itself. The check only tested to see if the iter was on the commit
    page, but the commit page was no longer pointing to the reader page, but as
    all pages were empty, the buffer is also.

    ACPI / power: Avoid maybe-uninitialized warning
    
    commit fe8c470ab87d90e4b5115902dd94eced7e3305c3 upstream.
    
    gcc -O2 cannot always prove that the loop in acpi_power_get_inferred_state()
    is enterered at least once, so it assumes that cur_state might not get
    initialized:
    
    drivers/acpi/power.c: In function 'acpi_power_get_inferred_state':
    drivers/acpi/power.c:222:9: error: 'cur_state' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    
    This sets the variable to zero at the start of the loop, to ensure that
    there is well-defined behavior even for an empty list. This gets rid of
    the warning.
    
    The warning first showed up when the -Os flag got removed in a bug fix
    patch in linux-4.11-rc5.
    
    I would suggest merging this addon patch on top of that bug fix to avoid
    introducing a new warning in the stable kernels.

    KEYS: Change the name of the dead type to ".dead" to prevent user access
    
    commit c1644fe041ebaf6519f6809146a77c3ead9193af upstream.
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-6951.
    
    Userspace should not be able to do things with the "dead" key type as it
    doesn't have some of the helper functions set upon it that the kernel
    needs.  Attempting to use it may cause the kernel to crash.
    
    Fix this by changing the name of the type to ".dead" so that it's rejected
    up front on userspace syscalls by key_get_type_from_user().
    
    Though this doesn't seem to affect recent kernels, it does affect older
    ones, certainly those prior to:

    ftrace/x86: Fix triple fault with graph tracing and suspend-to-ram
    
    commit 34a477e5297cbaa6ecc6e17c042a866e1cbe80d6 upstream.
    
    On x86-32, with CONFIG_FIRMWARE and multiple CPUs, if you enable function
    graph tracing and then suspend to RAM, it will triple fault and reboot when
    it resumes.
    
    The first fault happens when booting a secondary CPU:
    
    startup_32_smp()
      load_ucode_ap()
        prepare_ftrace_return()
          ftrace_graph_is_dead()
            (accesses 'kill_ftrace_graph')
    
    The early head_32.S code calls into load_ucode_ap(), which has an an
    ftrace hook, so it calls prepare_ftrace_return(), which calls
    ftrace_graph_is_dead(), which tries to access the global
    'kill_ftrace_graph' variable with a virtual address, causing a fault
    because the CPU is still in real mode.
    
    The fix is to add a check in prepare_ftrace_return() to make sure it's
    running in protected mode before continuing.  The check makes sure the
    stack pointer is a virtual kernel address.  It's a bit of a hack, but
    it's not very intrusive and it works well enough.
    
    For reference, here are a few other (more difficult) ways this could
    have potentially been fixed:
    
    - Move startup_32_smp()'s call to load_ucode_ap() down to *after* paging
      is enabled.  (No idea what that would break.)
    
    - Track down load_ucode_ap()'s entire callee tree and mark all the
      functions 'notrace'.  (Probably not realistic.)
    
    - Pause graph tracing in ftrace_suspend_notifier_call() or bringup_cpu()
      or __cpu_up(), and ensure that the pause facility can be queried from
      real mode.

    ALSA: seq: Don't break snd_use_lock_sync() loop by timeout
    
    commit 4e7655fd4f47c23e5249ea260dc802f909a64611 upstream.
    
    The snd_use_lock_sync() (thus its implementation
    snd_use_lock_sync_helper()) has the 5 seconds timeout to break out of
    the sync loop.  It was introduced from the beginning, just to be
    "safer", in terms of avoiding the stupid bugs.
    
    However, as Ben Hutchings suggested, this timeout rather introduces a
    potential leak or use-after-free that was apparently fixed by the
    commit 2d7d54002e39 ("ALSA: seq: Fix race during FIFO resize"):
    for example, snd_seq_fifo_event_in() -> snd_seq_event_dup() ->
    copy_from_user() could block for a long time, and snd_use_lock_sync()
    goes timeout and still leaves the cell at releasing the pool.
    
    For fixing such a problem, we remove the break by the timeout while
    still keeping the warning.

    MIPS: KGDB: Use kernel context for sleeping threads
    
    commit 162b270c664dca2e0944308e92f9fcc887151a72 upstream.
    
    KGDB is a kernel debug stub and it can't be used to debug userland as it
    can only safely access kernel memory.
    
    On MIPS however KGDB has always got the register state of sleeping
    processes from the userland register context at the beginning of the
    kernel stack. This is meaningless for kernel threads (which never enter
    userland), and for user threads it prevents the user seeing what it is
    doing while in the kernel:
    
    (gdb) info threads
      Id   Target Id         Frame
      ...
      3    Thread 2 (kthreadd) 0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()
      2    Thread 1 (init)   0x000000007705c4b4 in ?? ()
      1    Thread -2 (shadowCPU0) 0xffffffff8012524c in arch_kgdb_breakpoint () at arch/mips/kernel/kgdb.c:201
    
    Get the register state instead from the (partial) kernel register
    context stored in the task's thread_struct for resume() to restore. All
    threads now correctly appear to be in context_switch():
    
    (gdb) info threads
      Id   Target Id         Frame
      ...
      3    Thread 2 (kthreadd) context_switch (rq=<optimized out>, cookie=..., next=<optimized out>, prev=0x0) at kernel/sched/core.c:2903
      2    Thread 1 (init)   context_switch (rq=<optimized out>, cookie=..., next=<optimized out>, prev=0x0) at kernel/sched/core.c:2903
      1    Thread -2 (shadowCPU0) 0xffffffff8012524c in arch_kgdb_breakpoint () at arch/mips/kernel/kgdb.c:201
    
    Call clobbered registers which aren't saved and exception registers
    (BadVAddr & Cause) which can't be easily determined without stack
    unwinding are reported as 0. The PC is taken from the return address,
    such that the state presented matches that found immediately after
    returning from resume().

    ptrace: fix PTRACE_LISTEN race corrupting task->state
    
    commit 5402e97af667e35e54177af8f6575518bf251d51 upstream.
    
    In PT_SEIZED + LISTEN mode STOP/CONT signals cause a wakeup against
    __TASK_TRACED.  If this races with the ptrace_unfreeze_traced at the end
    of a PTRACE_LISTEN, this can wake the task /after/ the check against
    __TASK_TRACED, but before the reset of state to TASK_TRACED.  This
    causes it to instead clobber TASK_WAKING, allowing a subsequent wakeup
    against TRACED while the task is still on the rq wake_list, corrupting
    it.
    
    Oleg said:
     "The kernel can crash or this can lead to other hard-to-debug problems.
      In short, "task->state = TASK_TRACED" in ptrace_unfreeze_traced()
      assumes that nobody else can wake it up, but PTRACE_LISTEN breaks the
      contract. Obviusly it is very wrong to manipulate task->state if this
      task is already running, or WAKING, or it sleeps again"

    We previously made sure that the reported disk capacity was less than

    was reported in units of 512 bytes.
    
    Add a sanity check function to ensure that we only enable disks if the
    entire reported capacity can be expressed in terms of sector_t.

    l2tp: take reference on sessions being dumped
    
    commit e08293a4ccbcc993ded0fdc46f1e57926b833d63 upstream.
    
    Take a reference on the sessions returned by l2tp_session_find_nth()
    (and rename it l2tp_session_get_nth() to reflect this change), so that
    caller is assured that the session isn't going to disappear while
    processing it.
    
    For procfs and debugfs handlers, the session is held in the .start()
    callback and dropped in .show(). Given that pppol2tp_seq_session_show()
    dereferences the associated PPPoL2TP socket and that
    l2tp_dfs_seq_session_show() might call pppol2tp_show(), we also need to
    call the session's .ref() callback to prevent the socket from going
    away from under us.

    powerpc: Don't try to fix up misaligned load-with-reservation instructions
    
    commit 48fe9e9488743eec9b7c1addd3c93f12f2123d54 upstream.
    
    In the past, there was only one load-with-reservation instruction,
    lwarx, and if a program attempted a lwarx on a misaligned address, it
    would take an alignment interrupt and the kernel handler would emulate
    it as though it was lwzx, which was not really correct, but benign since
    it is loading the right amount of data, and the lwarx should be paired
    with a stwcx. to the same address, which would also cause an alignment
    interrupt which would result in a SIGBUS being delivered to the process.
    
    We now have 5 different sizes of load-with-reservation instruction. Of
    those, lharx and ldarx cause an immediate SIGBUS by luck since their
    entries in aligninfo[] overlap instructions which were not fixed up, but
    lqarx overlaps with lhz and will be emulated as such. lbarx can never
    generate an alignment interrupt since it only operates on 1 byte.
    
    To straighten this out and fix the lqarx case, this adds code to detect
    the l[hwdq]arx instructions and return without fixing them up, resulting
    in a SIGBUS being delivered to the process.

    iscsi-target: Drop work-around for legacy GlobalSAN initiator
    
    commit 1c99de981f30b3e7868b8d20ce5479fa1c0fea46 upstream.
    
    Once upon a time back in 2009, a work-around was added to support
    the GlobalSAN iSCSI initiator v3.3 for MacOSX, which during login
    did not propose nor respond to MaxBurstLength, FirstBurstLength,
    DefaultTime2Wait and DefaultTime2Retain keys.
    
    The work-around in iscsi_check_proposer_for_optional_reply()
    allowed the missing keys to be proposed, but did not require
    waiting for a response before moving to full feature phase
    operation.  This allowed GlobalSAN v3.3 to work out-of-the
    box, and for many years we didn't run into login interopt
    issues with any other initiators..
    
    Until recently, when Martin tried a QLogic 57840S iSCSI Offload
    HBA on Windows 2016 which completed login, but subsequently
    failed with:
    
        Got unknown iSCSI OpCode: 0x43
    
    The issue was QLogic MSFT side did not propose DefaultTime2Wait +
    DefaultTime2Retain, so LIO proposes them itself, and immediately
    transitions to full feature phase because of the GlobalSAN hack.
    However, the QLogic MSFT side still attempts to respond to
    DefaultTime2Retain + DefaultTime2Wait, even though LIO has set
    ISCSI_FLAG_LOGIN_NEXT_STAGE3 + ISCSI_FLAG_LOGIN_TRANSIT
    in last login response.
    
    So while the QLogic MSFT side should have been proposing these
    two keys to start, it was doing the correct thing per RFC-3720
    attempting to respond to proposed keys before transitioning to
    full feature phase.
    
    All that said, recent versions of GlobalSAN iSCSI (v5.3.0.541)
    does correctly propose the four keys during login, making the
    original work-around moot.
    
    So in order to allow QLogic MSFT to run unmodified as-is, go
    ahead and drop this long standing work-around.

    l2tp: take a reference on sessions used in genetlink handlers
    
    commit 2777e2ab5a9cf2b4524486c6db1517a6ded25261 upstream.
    
    Callers of l2tp_nl_session_find() need to hold a reference on the
    returned session since there's no guarantee that it isn't going to
    disappear from under them.
    
    Relying on the fact that no l2tp netlink message may be processed
    concurrently isn't enough: sessions can be deleted by other means
    (e.g. by closing the PPPOL2TP socket of a ppp pseudowire).
    
    l2tp_nl_cmd_session_delete() is a bit special: it runs a callback
    function that may require a previous call to session->ref(). In
    particular, for ppp pseudowires, the callback is l2tp_session_delete(),
    which then calls pppol2tp_session_close() and dereferences the PPPOL2TP
    socket. The socket might already be gone at the moment
    l2tp_session_delete() calls session->ref(), so we need to take a
    reference during the session lookup. So we need to pass the do_ref
    variable down to l2tp_session_get() and l2tp_session_get_by_ifname().
    
    Since all callers have to be updated, l2tp_session_find_by_ifname() and
    l2tp_nl_session_find() are renamed to reflect their new behaviour.

    l2tp: fix duplicate session creation
    
    commit dbdbc73b44782e22b3b4b6e8b51e7a3d245f3086 upstream.
    
    l2tp_session_create() relies on its caller for checking for duplicate
    sessions. This is racy since a session can be concurrently inserted
    after the caller's verification.
    
    Fix this by letting l2tp_session_create() verify sessions uniqueness
    upon insertion. Callers need to be adapted to check for
    l2tp_session_create()'s return code instead of calling
    l2tp_session_find().
    
    pppol2tp_connect() is a bit special because it has to work on existing
    sessions (if they're not connected) or to create a new session if none
    is found. When acting on a preexisting session, a reference must be
    held or it could go away on us. So we have to use l2tp_session_get()
    instead of l2tp_session_find() and drop the reference before exiting.

    l2tp: ensure session can't get removed during pppol2tp_session_ioctl()
    
    commit 57377d63547861919ee634b845c7caa38de4a452 upstream.
    
    Holding a reference on session is required before calling
    pppol2tp_session_ioctl(). The session could get freed while processing the
    ioctl otherwise. Since pppol2tp_session_ioctl() uses the session's socket,
    we also need to take a reference on it in l2tp_session_get().

    Taking a reference on sessions in l2tp_recv_common() is racy; this
    has to be done by the callers.
    
    To this end, a new function is required (l2tp_session_get()) to

    serial: mxs-auart: Fix baudrate calculation
    
    commit a6040bc610554c66088fda3608ae5d6307c548e4 upstream.
    
    The reference manual for the i.MX28 recommends to calculate the divisor
    as
    
            divisor = (UARTCLK * 32) / baud rate, rounded to the nearest integer
    
    , so let's do this. For a typical setup of UARTCLK = 24 MHz and baud
    rate = 115200 this changes the divisor from 6666 to 6667 and so the
    actual baud rate improves from 115211.521 Bd (error ≅ 0.01 %) to
    115194.240 Bd (error ≅ 0.005 %).

    ubi/upd: Always flush after prepared for an update
    
    commit 9cd9a21ce070be8a918ffd3381468315a7a76ba6 upstream.
    
    In commit 6afaf8a484cb ("UBI: flush wl before clearing update marker") I
    managed to trigger and fix a similar bug. Now here is another version of
    which I assumed it wouldn't matter back then but it turns out UBI has a
    check for it and will error out like this:
    
    |ubi0 warning: validate_vid_hdr: inconsistent used_ebs
    |ubi0 error: validate_vid_hdr: inconsistent VID header at PEB 592
    
    All you need to trigger this is? "ubiupdatevol /dev/ubi0_0 file" + a
    powercut in the middle of the operation.
    ubi_start_update() sets the update-marker and puts all EBs on the erase
    list. After that userland can proceed to write new data while the old EB
    aren't erased completely. A powercut at this point is usually not that
    much of a tragedy. UBI won't give read access to the static volume
    because it has the update marker. It will most likely set the corrupted
    flag because it misses some EBs.
    So we are all good. Unless the size of the image that has been written
    differs from the old image in the magnitude of at least one EB. In that
    case UBI will find two different values for `used_ebs' and refuse to
    attach the image with the error message mentioned above.
    
    So in order not to get in the situation, the patch will ensure that we
    wait until everything is removed before it tries to write any data.
    The alternative would be to detect such a case and remove all EBs at the
    attached time after we processed the volume-table and see the
    update-marker set. The patch looks bigger and I doubt it is worth it
    since usually the write() will wait from time to time for a new EB since
    usually there not that many spare EB that can be used.

    xhci: Manually give back cancelled URB if we can't queue it for cancel
    
    commit d3519b9d9606991a1305596348b6d690bfa3eb27 upstream.
    
    xhci needs to take care of four scenarios when asked to cancel a URB.
    
    1 URB is not queued or already given back.
      usb_hcd_check_unlink_urb() will return an error, we pass the error on
    
    2 We fail to find xhci internal structures from urb private data such as
      virtual device and endpoint ring.
      Give back URB immediately, can't do anything about internal structures.
    
    3 URB private data has valid pointers to xhci internal data, but host is
      not  responding.
      give back URB immedately and remove the URB from the endpoint lists.
    
    4 Everyting is working
      add URB to cancel list, queue a command to stop the endpoint, after
      which the URB can be turned to no-op or skipped, removed from lists,
      and given back.
    
    We failed to give back the urb in case 2 where the correct device and
    endpoint pointers could not be retrieved from URB private data.
    
    This caused a hang on Dell Inspiron 5558/0VNM2T at resume from suspend
    as urb was never returned.

    ACPI: Fix incompatibility with mcount-based function graph tracing
    
    commit 61b79e16c68d703dde58c25d3935d67210b7d71b upstream.
    
    Paul Menzel reported a warning:
    
      WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 774 at /build/linux-ROBWaj/linux-4.9.13/kernel/trace/trace_functions_graph.c:233 ftrace_return_to_handler+0x1aa/0x1e0
      Bad frame pointer: expected f6919d98, received f6919db0
        from func acpi_pm_device_sleep_wake return to c43b6f9d
    
    The warning means that function graph tracing is broken for the
    acpi_pm_device_sleep_wake() function.  That's because the ACPI Makefile
    unconditionally sets the '-Os' gcc flag to optimize for size.  That's an
    issue because mcount-based function graph tracing is incompatible with
    '-Os' on x86, thanks to the following gcc bug:
    
      https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=42109
    
    I have another patch pending which will ensure that mcount-based
    function graph tracing is never used with CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE on
    x86.
    
    But this patch is needed in addition to that one because the ACPI
    Makefile overrides that config option for no apparent reason.  It has
    had this flag since the beginning of git history, and there's no related
    comment, so I don't know why it's there.  As far as I can tell, there's
    no reason for it to be there.  The appropriate behavior is for it to
    honor CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_{SIZE,PERFORMANCE} like the rest of the
    kernel.

    commit 7d64f82cceb21e6d95db312d284f5f195e120154 upstream.
    
    When removing a GHES device notified by SCI, list_del_rcu() is used,
    ghes_remove() should call synchronize_rcu() before it goes on to call
    kfree(ghes), otherwise concurrent RCU readers may still hold this list
    entry after it has been freed.

    virtio_balloon: prevent uninitialized variable use
    
    commit f0bb2d50dfcc519f06f901aac88502be6ff1df2c upstream.
    
    The latest gcc-7.0.1 snapshot reports a new warning:

    virtio_balloon: init 1st buffer in stats vq
    
    commit fc8653228c8588a120f6b5dad6983b7b61ff669e upstream.
    
    When init_vqs runs, virtio_balloon.stats is either uninitialized or
    contains stale values. The host updates its state with garbage data
    because it has no way of knowing that this is just a marker buffer
    used for signaling.
    
    This patch updates the stats before pushing the initial buffer.
    
    Alternative fixes:
    * Push an empty buffer in init_vqs. Not easily done with the current
      virtio implementation and violates the spec "Driver MUST supply the
      same subset of statistics in all buffers submitted to the statsq".
    * Push a buffer with invalid tags in init_vqs. Violates the same
      spec clause, plus "invalid tag" is not really defined.
    
    Note: the spec says:
            When using the legacy interface, the device SHOULD ignore all values in
            the first buffer in the statsq supplied by the driver after device
            initialization. Note: Historically, drivers supplied an uninitialized
            buffer in the first buffer.
    
    Unfortunately QEMU does not seem to implement the recommendation
    even for the legacy interface.

    mmc: sdhci: Do not disable interrupts while waiting for clock
    
    commit e2ebfb2142acefecc2496e71360f50d25726040b upstream.
    
    Disabling interrupts for even a millisecond can cause problems for some
    devices. That can happen when sdhci changes clock frequency because it
    waits for the clock to become stable under a spin lock.
    
    The spin lock is not necessary here. Anything that is racing with changes
    to the I/O state is already broken. The mmc core already provides
    synchronization via "claiming" the host.
    
    Although the spin lock probably should be removed from the code paths that
    lead to this point, such a patch would touch too much code to be suitable
    for stable trees. Consequently, for this patch, just drop the spin lock
    while waiting.

    commit d82c0d12c92705ef468683c9b7a8298dd61ed191 upstream.
    
    Reorder the operations in decompress_kernel() to ensure initrd is moved
    to a safe location before the bss section is zeroed.
    
    During decompression bss can overlap with the initrd and this can
    corrupt the initrd contents depending on the size of the compressed
    kernel (which affects where the initrd is placed by the bootloader) and
    the size of the bss section of the decompressor.
    
    Also use the correct initrd size when checking for overlaps with
    parmblock.

    net: unix: properly re-increment inflight counter of GC discarded candidates
    
    commit 7df9c24625b9981779afb8fcdbe2bb4765e61147 upstream.
    
    Dmitry has reported that a BUG_ON() condition in unix_notinflight()
    may be triggered by a simple code that forwards unix socket in an
    SCM_RIGHTS message.
    That is caused by incorrect unix socket GC implementation in unix_gc().
    
    The GC first collects list of candidates, then (a) decrements their
    "children's" inflight counter, (b) checks which inflight counters are
    now 0, and then (c) increments all inflight counters back.
    (a) and (c) are done by calling scan_children() with inc_inflight or
    dec_inflight as the second argument.
    
    Commit 6209344f5a37 ("net: unix: fix inflight counting bug in garbage
    collector") changed scan_children() such that it no longer considers
    sockets that do not have UNIX_GC_CANDIDATE flag. It also added a block
    of code that that unsets this flag _before_ invoking
    scan_children(, dec_iflight, ). This may lead to incorrect inflight
    counters for some sockets.
    
    This change fixes this bug by changing order of operations:
    UNIX_GC_CANDIDATE is now unset only after all inflight counters are
    restored to the original state.

    ALSA: seq: Fix racy cell insertions during snd_seq_pool_done()
    
    commit c520ff3d03f0b5db7146d9beed6373ad5d2a5e0e upstream.
    
    When snd_seq_pool_done() is called, it marks the closing flag to
    refuse the further cell insertions.  But snd_seq_pool_done() itself
    doesn't clear the cells but just waits until all cells are cleared by
    the caller side.  That is, it's racy, and this leads to the endless
    stall as syzkaller spotted.
    
    This patch addresses the racy by splitting the setup of pool->closing
    flag out of snd_seq_pool_done(), and calling it properly before
    snd_seq_pool_done().

    scsi: libsas: fix ata xfer length
    
    commit 9702c67c6066f583b629cf037d2056245bb7a8e6 upstream.
    
    The total ata xfer length may not be calculated properly, in that we do
    not use the proper method to get an sg element dma length.
    
    According to the code comment, sg_dma_len() should be used after
    dma_map_sg() is called.
    
    This issue was found by turning on the SMMUv3 in front of the hisi_sas
    controller in hip07. Multiple sg elements were being combined into a
    single element, but the original first element length was being use as
    the total xfer length.

    ALSA: ctxfi: Fix the incorrect check of dma_set_mask() call
    
    commit f363a06642f28caaa78cb6446bbad90c73fe183c upstream.
    
    In the commit [15c75b09f8d1: ALSA: ctxfi: Fallback DMA mask to 32bit],
    I forgot to put "!" at dam_set_mask() call check in cthw20k1.c (while
    cthw20k2.c is OK).  This patch fixes that obvious bug.
    
    (As a side note: although the original commit was completely wrong,
     it's still working for most of machines, as it sets to 32bit DMA mask
     in the end.  So the bug severity is low.)

    perf symbols: Fix symbols__fixup_end heuristic for corner cases
    
    commit e7ede72a6d40cb3a30c087142d79381ca8a31dab upstream.
    
    The current symbols__fixup_end() heuristic for the last entry in the rb
    tree is suboptimal as it leads to not being able to recognize the symbol
    in the call graph in a couple of corner cases, for example:
    
     i) If the symbol has a start address (f.e. exposed via kallsyms)
        that is at a page boundary, then the roundup(curr->start, 4096)
        for the last entry will result in curr->start == curr->end with
        a symbol length of zero.
    
    ii) If the symbol has a start address that is shortly before a page
        boundary, then also here, curr->end - curr->start will just be
        very few bytes, where it's unrealistic that we could perform a
        match against.
    
    Instead, change the heuristic to roundup(curr->start, 4096) + 4096, so
    that we can catch such corner cases and have a better chance to find
    that specific symbol. It's still just best effort as the real end of the
    symbol is unknown to us (and could even be at a larger offset than the
    current range), but better than the current situation.
    
    Alexei reported that he recently run into case i) with a JITed eBPF
    program (these are all page aligned) as the last symbol which wasn't
    properly shown in the call graph (while other eBPF program symbols in
    the rb tree were displayed correctly). Since this is a generic issue,
    lets try to improve the heuristic a bit.

    USB: usbtmc: add missing endpoint sanity check
    
    commit 687e0687f71ec00e0132a21fef802dee88c2f1ad upstream.
    
    USBTMC devices are required to have a bulk-in and a bulk-out endpoint,
    but the driver failed to verify this, something which could lead to the
    endpoint addresses being taken from uninitialised memory.
    
    Make sure to zero all private data as part of allocation, and add the
    missing endpoint sanity check.
    
    Note that this also addresses a more recently introduced issue, where
    the interrupt-in-presence flag would also be uninitialised whenever the
    optional interrupt-in endpoint is not present. This in turn could lead
    to an interrupt urb being allocated, initialised and submitted based on
    uninitialised values.

    sched/loadavg: Avoid loadavg spikes caused by delayed NO_HZ accounting
    
    commit 6e5f32f7a43f45ee55c401c0b9585eb01f9629a8 upstream.
    
    If we crossed a sample window while in NO_HZ we will add LOAD_FREQ to
    the pending sample window time on exit, setting the next update not
    one window into the future, but two.
    
    This situation on exiting NO_HZ is described by:
    
      this_rq->calc_load_update < jiffies < calc_load_update
    
    In this scenario, what we should be doing is:
    
      this_rq->calc_load_update = calc_load_update               [ next window ]
    
    But what we actually do is:
    
      this_rq->calc_load_update = calc_load_update + LOAD_FREQ   [ next+1 window ]
    
    This has the effect of delaying load average updates for potentially
    up to ~9seconds.
    
    This can result in huge spikes in the load average values due to
    per-cpu uninterruptible task counts being out of sync when accumulated
    across all CPUs.
    
    It's safe to update the per-cpu active count if we wake between sample
    windows because any load that we left in 'calc_load_idle' will have
    been zero'd when the idle load was folded in calc_global_load().
    
    This issue is easy to reproduce before,
    
      commit 9d89c257dfb9 ("sched/fair: Rewrite runnable load and utilization average tracking")
    
    just by forking short-lived process pipelines built from ps(1) and
    grep(1) in a loop. I'm unable to reproduce the spikes after that
    commit, but the bug still seems to be present from code review.

    futex: Fix potential use-after-free in FUTEX_REQUEUE_PI
    
    commit c236c8e95a3d395b0494e7108f0d41cf36ec107c upstream.
    
    While working on the futex code, I stumbled over this potential
    use-after-free scenario. Dmitry triggered it later with syzkaller.
    
    pi_mutex is a pointer into pi_state, which we drop the reference on in
    unqueue_me_pi(). So any access to that pointer after that is bad.
    
    Since other sites already do rt_mutex_unlock() with hb->lock held, see
    for example futex_lock_pi(), simply move the unlock before
    unqueue_me_pi().

    usb-core: Add LINEAR_FRAME_INTR_BINTERVAL USB quirk
    
    commit 3243367b209faed5c320a4e5f9a565ee2a2ba958 upstream.
    
    Some USB 2.0 devices erroneously report millisecond values in
    bInterval. The generic config code manages to catch most of them,
    but in some cases it's not completely enough.
    
    The case at stake here is a USB 2.0 braille device, which wants to
    announce 10ms and thus sets bInterval to 10, but with the USB 2.0
    computation that yields to 64ms.  It happens that one can type fast
    enough to reach this interval and get the device buffers overflown,
    leading to problematic latencies.  The generic config code does not
    catch this case because the 64ms is considered a sane enough value.
    
    This change thus adds a USB_QUIRK_LINEAR_FRAME_INTR_BINTERVAL quirk
    to mark devices which actually report milliseconds in bInterval,
    and marks Vario Ultra devices as needing it.

    uwb: i1480-dfu: fix NULL-deref at probe
    
    commit 4ce362711d78a4999011add3115b8f4b0bc25e8c upstream.
    
    Make sure to check the number of endpoints to avoid dereferencing a
    NULL-pointer should a malicious device lack endpoints.
    
    Note that the dereference happens in the cmd and wait_init_done
    callbacks which are called during probe.

    commit 03ace948a4eb89d1cf51c06afdfc41ebca5fdb27 upstream.
    
    Make sure to check the number of endpoints to avoid dereferencing a
    NULL-pointer or accessing memory beyond the endpoint array should a
    malicious device lack the expected endpoints.
    
    This specifically fixes the NULL-pointer dereference when probing HWA HC

    USB: uss720: fix NULL-deref at probe
    
    commit f259ca3eed6e4b79ac3d5c5c9fb259fb46e86217 upstream.
    
    Make sure to check the number of endpoints to avoid dereferencing a
    NULL-pointer or accessing memory beyond the endpoint array should a
    malicious device lack the expected endpoints.
    
    Note that the endpoint access that causes the NULL-deref is currently
    only used for debugging purposes during probe so the oops only happens
    when dynamic debugging is enabled. This means the driver could be
    rewritten to continue to accept device with only two endpoints, should
    such devices exist.

    udp: avoid ufo handling on IP payload compression packets
    
    commit 4b3b45edba9222e518a1ec72df841eba3609fe34 upstream.
    
    commit c146066ab802 ("ipv4: Don't use ufo handling on later transformed
    packets") and commit f89c56ce710a ("ipv6: Don't use ufo handling on
    later transformed packets") added a check that 'rt->dst.header_len' isn't
    zero in order to skip UFO, but it doesn't include IPcomp in transport mode
    where it equals zero.
    
    Packets, after payload compression, may not require further fragmentation,
    and if original length exceeds MTU, later compressed packets will be
    transmitted incorrectly. This can be reproduced with LTP udp_ipsec.sh test
    on veth device with enabled UFO, MTU is 1500 and UDP payload is 2000:
    
    * IPv4 case, offset is wrong + unnecessary fragmentation
        udp_ipsec.sh -p comp -m transport -s 2000 &
        tcpdump -ni ltp_ns_veth2
        ...
        IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 45203, offset 0, flags [+],
          proto Compressed IP (108), length 49)
          10.0.0.2 > 10.0.0.1: IPComp(cpi=0x1000)
        IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 45203, offset 1480, flags [none],
          proto UDP (17), length 21) 10.0.0.2 > 10.0.0.1: ip-proto-17
    
    * IPv6 case, sending small fragments
        udp_ipsec.sh -6 -p comp -m transport -s 2000 &
        tcpdump -ni ltp_ns_veth2
        ...
        IP6 (flowlabel 0x6b9ba, hlim 64, next-header Compressed IP (108)
          payload length: 37) fd00::2 > fd00::1: IPComp(cpi=0x1000)
        IP6 (flowlabel 0x6b9ba, hlim 64, next-header Compressed IP (108)
          payload length: 21) fd00::2 > fd00::1: IPComp(cpi=0x1000)
    
    Fix it by checking 'rt->dst.xfrm' pointer to 'xfrm_state' struct, skip UFO
    if xfrm is set. So the new check will include both cases: IPcomp and IPsec.

    USB: serial: safe_serial: fix information leak in completion handler
    
    commit 8c76d7cd520ebffc1ea9ea0850d87a224a50c7f2 upstream.
    
    Add missing sanity check to the bulk-in completion handler to avoid an
    integer underflow that could be triggered by a malicious device.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: make Set Endpoint Configuration macros safe
    
    commit 7369090a9fb57c3fc705ce355d2e4523a5a24716 upstream.
    
    Some gadget drivers are bad, bad boys. We notice
    that ADB was passing bad Burst Size which caused top
    bits of param0 to be overwritten which confused DWC3
    when running this command.
    
    In order to avoid future issues, we're going to make
    sure values passed by macros are always safe for the
    controller. Note that ADB still needs a fix to *not*
    pass bad values.

    tracing: Add #undef to fix compile error
    
    commit bf7165cfa23695c51998231c4efa080fe1d3548d upstream.
    
    There are several trace include files that define TRACE_INCLUDE_FILE.
    
    Include several of them in the same .c file (as I currently have in
    some code I am working on), and the compile will blow up with a
    "warning: "TRACE_INCLUDE_FILE" redefined #define TRACE_INCLUDE_FILE syscalls"
    
    Every other include file in include/trace/events/ avoids that issue
    by having a #undef TRACE_INCLUDE_FILE before the #define; syscalls.h
    should have one, too.

    xen: do not re-use pirq number cached in pci device msi msg data
    
    commit c74fd80f2f41d05f350bb478151021f88551afe8 upstream.
    
    Revert the main part of commit:
    af42b8d12f8a ("xen: fix MSI setup and teardown for PV on HVM guests")
    
    That commit introduced reading the pci device's msi message data to see
    if a pirq was previously configured for the device's msi/msix, and re-use
    that pirq.  At the time, that was the correct behavior.  However, a
    later change to Qemu caused it to call into the Xen hypervisor to unmap
    all pirqs for a pci device, when the pci device disables its MSI/MSIX
    vectors; specifically the Qemu commit:
    c976437c7dba9c7444fb41df45468968aaa326ad
    ("qemu-xen: free all the pirqs for msi/msix when driver unload")
    
    Once Qemu added this pirq unmapping, it was no longer correct for the
    kernel to re-use the pirq number cached in the pci device msi message
    data.  All Qemu releases since 2.1.0 contain the patch that unmaps the
    pirqs when the pci device disables its MSI/MSIX vectors.
    
    This bug is causing failures to initialize multiple NVMe controllers
    under Xen, because the NVMe driver sets up a single MSIX vector for
    each controller (concurrently), and then after using that to talk to
    the controller for some configuration data, it disables the single MSIX
    vector and re-configures all the MSIX vectors it needs.  So the MSIX
    setup code tries to re-use the cached pirq from the first vector
    for each controller, but the hypervisor has already given away that
    pirq to another controller, and its initialization fails.
    
    This is discussed in more detail at:
    https://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2017-01/msg00447.html
