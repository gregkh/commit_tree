    bcache: release dc->writeback_lock properly in bch_writeback_thread()
    
    commit 3943b040f11ed0cc6d4585fd286a623ca8634547 upstream.
    
    The writeback thread would exit with a lock held when the cache device
    is detached via sysfs interface, fix it by releasing the held lock
    before exiting the while-loop.

    getxattr: use correct xattr length
    
    commit 82c9a927bc5df6e06b72d206d24a9d10cced4eb5 upstream.
    
    When running in a container with a user namespace, if you call getxattr
    with name = "system.posix_acl_access" and size % 8 != 4, then getxattr
    silently skips the user namespace fixup that it normally does resulting in
    un-fixed-up data being returned.
    This is caused by posix_acl_fix_xattr_to_user() being passed the total
    buffer size and not the actual size of the xattr as returned by
    vfs_getxattr().
    This commit passes the actual length of the xattr as returned by
    vfs_getxattr() down.
    
    A reproducer for the issue is:
    
      touch acl_posix
    
      setfacl -m user:0:rwx acl_posix
    
    and the compile:
    
      #define _GNU_SOURCE

    udlfb: set optimal write delay
    
    commit bb24153a3f13dd0dbc1f8055ad97fe346d598f66 upstream.
    
    The default delay 5 jiffies is too much when the kernel is compiled with
    HZ=100 - it results in jumpy cursor in Xwindow.
    
    In order to find out the optimal delay, I benchmarked the driver on
    1280x720x30fps video. I found out that with HZ=1000, 10ms is acceptable,
    but with HZ=250 or HZ=300, we need 4ms, so that the video is played
    without any frame skips.
    
    This patch changes the delay to this value.

    fb: fix lost console when the user unplugs a USB adapter
    
    commit 8c5b044299951acd91e830a688dd920477ea1eda upstream.
    
    I have a USB display adapter using the udlfb driver and I use it on an ARM
    board that doesn't have any graphics card. When I plug the adapter in, the
    console is properly displayed, however when I unplug and re-plug the
    adapter, the console is not displayed and I can't access it until I reboot
    the board.
    
    The reason is this:
    When the adapter is unplugged, dlfb_usb_disconnect calls
    unlink_framebuffer, then it waits until the reference count drops to zero
    and then it deallocates the framebuffer. However, the console that is
    attached to the framebuffer device keeps the reference count non-zero, so
    the framebuffer device is never destroyed. When the USB adapter is plugged
    again, it creates a new device /dev/fb1 and the console is not attached to
    it.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by unbinding the console from unlink_framebuffer.
    The code to unbind the console is moved from do_unregister_framebuffer to
    a function unbind_console. When the console is unbound, the reference
    count drops to zero and the udlfb driver frees the framebuffer. When the
    adapter is plugged back, a new framebuffer is created and the console is
    attached to it.

    pwm: tiehrpwm: Fix disabling of output of PWMs
    
    commit 38dabd91ff0bde33352ca3cc65ef515599b77a05 upstream.
    
    pwm-tiehrpwm driver disables PWM output by putting it in low output
    state via active AQCSFRC register in ehrpwm_pwm_disable(). But, the
    AQCSFRC shadow register is not updated. Therefore, when shadow AQCSFRC
    register is re-enabled in ehrpwm_pwm_enable() (say to enable second PWM
    output), previous settings are lost as shadow register value is loaded
    into active register. This results in things like PWMA getting enabled
    automatically, when PWMB is enabled and vice versa. Fix this by
    updating AQCSFRC shadow register as well during ehrpwm_pwm_disable().

    ubifs: Fix synced_i_size calculation for xattr inodes
    
    commit 59965593205fa4044850d35ee3557cf0b7edcd14 upstream.
    
    In ubifs_jnl_update() we sync parent and child inodes to the flash,
    in case of xattrs, the parent inode (AKA host inode) has a non-zero
    data_len. Therefore we need to adjust synced_i_size too.
    
    This issue was reported by ubifs self tests unter a xattr related work
    load.
    UBIFS error (ubi0:0 pid 1896): dbg_check_synced_i_size: ui_size is 4, synced_i_size is 0, but inode is clean
    UBIFS error (ubi0:0 pid 1896): dbg_check_synced_i_size: i_ino 65, i_mode 0x81a4, i_size 4

    ARM: tegra: Fix Tegra30 Cardhu PCA954x reset
    
    commit 6e1811900b6fe6f2b4665dba6bd6ed32c6b98575 upstream.
    
    On all versions of Tegra30 Cardhu, the reset signal to the NXP PCA9546
    I2C mux is connected to the Tegra GPIO BB0. Currently, this pin on the
    Tegra is not configured as a GPIO but as a special-function IO (SFIO)
    that is multiplexing the pin to an I2S controller. On exiting system
    suspend, I2C commands sent to the PCA9546 are failing because there is
    no ACK. Although it is not possible to see exactly what is happening
    to the reset during suspend, by ensuring it is configured as a GPIO
    and driven high, to de-assert the reset, the failures are no longer
    seen.
    
    Please note that this GPIO is also used to drive the reset signal
    going to the camera connector on the board. However, given that there
    is no camera support currently for Cardhu, this should not have any
    impact.

    uprobes: Use synchronize_rcu() not synchronize_sched()
    
    commit 016f8ffc48cb01d1e7701649c728c5d2e737d295 upstream.
    
    While debugging another bug, I was looking at all the synchronize*()
    functions being used in kernel/trace, and noticed that trace_uprobes was
    using synchronize_sched(), with a comment to synchronize with
    {u,ret}_probe_trace_func(). When looking at those functions, the data is
    protected with "rcu_read_lock()" and not with "rcu_read_lock_sched()". This
    is using the wrong synchronize_*() function.

    kthread, tracing: Don't expose half-written comm when creating kthreads
    
    commit 3e536e222f2930534c252c1cc7ae799c725c5ff9 upstream.
    
    There is a window for racing when printing directly to task->comm,
    allowing other threads to see a non-terminated string. The vsnprintf
    function fills the buffer, counts the truncated chars, then finally
    writes the \0 at the end.
    
            creator                     other
            vsnprintf:
              fill (not terminated)
              count the rest            trace_sched_waking(p):
              ...                         memcpy(comm, p->comm, TASK_COMM_LEN)
              write \0
    
    The consequences depend on how 'other' uses the string. In our case,
    it was copied into the tracing system's saved cmdlines, a buffer of
    adjacent TASK_COMM_LEN-byte buffers (note the 'n' where 0 should be):
    
            crash-arm64> x/1024s savedcmd->saved_cmdlines | grep 'evenk'
            0xffffffd5b3818640:     "irq/497-pwr_evenkworker/u16:12"
    
    ...and a strcpy out of there would cause stack corruption:
    
            [224761.522292] Kernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector:
                Kernel stack is corrupted in: ffffff9bf9783c78
    
            crash-arm64> kbt | grep 'comm\|trace_print_context'
            #6  0xffffff9bf9783c78 in trace_print_context+0x18c(+396)
                  comm (char [16]) =  "irq/497-pwr_even"
    
            crash-arm64> rd 0xffffffd4d0e17d14 8
            ffffffd4d0e17d14:  2f71726900000000 5f7277702d373934   ....irq/497-pwr_
            ffffffd4d0e17d24:  726f776b6e657665 3a3631752f72656b   evenkworker/u16:

            ffffffd4d0e17d44:  cede60c8ffffffd4 00000fffffffffd4   .....`..........
    
    The workaround in e09e28671 (use strlcpy in __trace_find_cmdline) was
    likely needed because of this same bug.
    
    Solved by vsnprintf:ing to a local buffer, then using set_task_comm().
    This way, there won't be a window where comm is not terminated.

    tracing/blktrace: Fix to allow setting same value
    
    commit 757d9140072054528b13bbe291583d9823cde195 upstream.
    
    Masami Hiramatsu reported:
    
      Current trace-enable attribute in sysfs returns an error
      if user writes the same setting value as current one,
      e.g.
    
        # cat /sys/block/sda/trace/enable
        0
        # echo 0 > /sys/block/sda/trace/enable
        bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
        # echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/trace/enable
        # echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/trace/enable
        bash: echo: write error: Device or resource busy
    
      But this is not a preferred behavior, it should ignore
      if new setting is same as current one. This fixes the
      problem as below.
    
        # cat /sys/block/sda/trace/enable
        0
        # echo 0 > /sys/block/sda/trace/enable
        # echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/trace/enable
        # echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/trace/enable

    tracing: Do not call start/stop() functions when tracing_on does not change
    
    commit f143641bfef9a4a60c57af30de26c63057e7e695 upstream.
    
    Currently, when one echo's in 1 into tracing_on, the current tracer's
    "start()" function is executed, even if tracing_on was already one. This can
    lead to strange side effects. One being that if the hwlat tracer is enabled,
    and someone does "echo 1 > tracing_on" into tracing_on, the hwlat tracer's
    start() function is called again which will recreate another kernel thread,
    and make it unable to remove the old one.

    commit 9a5094ca29ea9b1da301b31fd377c0c0c4c23034 upstream.
    
    A sysfs write callback function needs to either return the number of
    consumed characters or an error.
    
    The ad952x_store() function currently returns 0 if the input value was "0",
    this will signal that no characters have been consumed and the function
    will be called repeatedly in a loop indefinitely. Fix this by returning
    number of supplied characters to indicate that the whole input string has
    been consumed.

    dm cache metadata: save in-core policy_hint_size to on-disk superblock
    
    commit fd2fa95416188a767a63979296fa3e169a9ef5ec upstream.
    
    policy_hint_size starts as 0 during __write_initial_superblock().  It
    isn't until the policy is loaded that policy_hint_size is set in-core
    (cmd->policy_hint_size).  But it never got recorded in the on-disk
    superblock because __commit_transaction() didn't deal with transfering
    the in-core cmd->policy_hint_size to the on-disk superblock.
    
    The in-core cmd->policy_hint_size gets initialized by metadata_open()'s
    __begin_transaction_flags() which re-reads all superblock fields.
    Because the superblock's policy_hint_size was never properly stored, when
    the cache was created, hints_array_available() would always return false
    when re-activating a previously created cache.  This means
    __load_mappings() always considered the hints invalid and never made use
    of the hints (these hints served to optimize).
    
    Another detremental side-effect of this oversight is the cache_check
    utility would fail with: "invalid hint width: 0"

    powerpc/pseries: Fix endianness while restoring of r3 in MCE handler.
    
    commit cd813e1cd7122f2c261dce5b54d1e0c97f80e1a5 upstream.
    
    During Machine Check interrupt on pseries platform, register r3 points
    RTAS extended event log passed by hypervisor. Since hypervisor uses r3
    to pass pointer to rtas log, it stores the original r3 value at the
    start of the memory (first 8 bytes) pointed by r3. Since hypervisor
    stores this info and rtas log is in BE format, linux should make
    sure to restore r3 value in correct endian format.
    
    Without this patch when MCE handler, after recovery, returns to code that
    that caused the MCE may end up with Data SLB access interrupt for invalid
    address followed by kernel panic or hang.

    powerpc/fadump: handle crash memory ranges array index overflow
    
    commit 1bd6a1c4b80a28d975287630644e6b47d0f977a5 upstream.
    
    Crash memory ranges is an array of memory ranges of the crashing kernel
    to be exported as a dump via /proc/vmcore file. The size of the array
    is set based on INIT_MEMBLOCK_REGIONS, which works alright in most cases
    where memblock memory regions count is less than INIT_MEMBLOCK_REGIONS
    value. But this count can grow beyond INIT_MEMBLOCK_REGIONS value since
    commit 142b45a72e22 ("memblock: Add array resizing support").
    
    On large memory systems with a few DLPAR operations, the memblock memory
    regions count could be larger than INIT_MEMBLOCK_REGIONS value. On such
    systems, registering fadump results in crash or other system failures
    like below:

    as array index overflow is not checked for while setting up crash memory
    ranges causing memory corruption. To resolve this issue, dynamically
    allocate memory for crash memory ranges and resize it incrementally,
    in units of pagesize, on hitting array size limit.

    spi: davinci: fix a NULL pointer dereference
    
    commit 563a53f3906a6b43692498e5b3ae891fac93a4af upstream.
    
    On non-OF systems spi->controlled_data may be NULL. This causes a NULL
    pointer derefence on dm365-evm.
