    drm/i915: Prevent a race during I915_GEM_MMAP ioctl with WC set
    
    commit 2e7bd10e05afb866b5fb13eda25095c35d7a27cc upstream.
    
    Make sure the underlying VMA in the process address space is the
    same as it was during vm_mmap to avoid applying WC to wrong VMA.
    
    A more long-term solution would be to have vm_mmap_locked variant
    in linux/mmap.h for when caller wants to hold mmap_sem for an
    extended duration.
    
    v2:
    - Refactor the compare function

    drm/i915: Block fbdev HPD processing during suspend
    
    commit e8a8fedd57fdcebf0e4f24ef0fc7e29323df8e66 upstream.
    
    When resuming, we check whether or not any previously connected
    MST topologies are still present and if so, attempt to resume them. If
    this fails, we disable said MST topologies and fire off a hotplug event
    so that userspace knows to reprobe.
    
    However, sending a hotplug event involves calling
    drm_fb_helper_hotplug_event(), which in turn results in fbcon doing a
    connector reprobe in the caller's thread - something we can't do at the
    point in which i915 calls drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_resume() since
    hotplugging hasn't been fully initialized yet.
    
    This currently causes some rather subtle but fatal issues. For example,
    on my T480s the laptop dock connected to it usually disappears during a
    suspend cycle, and comes back up a short while after the system has been
    resumed. This guarantees pretty much every suspend and resume cycle,
    drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(mgr, false); will be caused and in turn,
    a connector hotplug will occur. Now it's Rute Goldberg time: when the
    connector hotplug occurs, i915 reprobes /all/ of the connectors,
    including eDP. However, eDP probing requires that we power on the panel
    VDD which in turn, grabs a wakeref to the appropriate power domain on
    the GPU (on my T480s, this is the PORT_DDI_A_IO domain). This is where
    things start breaking, since this all happens before
    intel_power_domains_enable() is called we end up leaking the wakeref
    that was acquired and never releasing it later. Come next suspend/resume
    cycle, this causes us to fail to shut down the GPU properly, which
    causes it not to resume properly and die a horrible complicated death.
    
    (as a note: this only happens when there's both an eDP panel and MST
    topology connected which is removed mid-suspend. One or the other seems
    to always be OK).
    
    We could try to fix the VDD wakeref leak, but this doesn't seem like
    it's worth it at all since we aren't able to handle hotplug detection
    while resuming anyway. So, let's go with a more robust solution inspired
    by nouveau: block fbdev from handling hotplug events until we resume
    fbdev. This allows us to still send sysfs hotplug events to be handled
    later by user space while we're resuming, while also preventing us from
    actually processing any hotplug events we receive until it's safe.
    
    This fixes the wakeref leak observed on the T480s and as such, also
    fixes suspend/resume with MST topologies connected on this machine.
    
    Changes since v2:
    * Don't call drm_fb_helper_hotplug_event() under lock, do it after lock
      (Chris Wilson)
    * Don't call drm_fb_helper_hotplug_event() in
      intel_fbdev_output_poll_changed() under lock (Chris Wilson)
    * Always set ifbdev->hpd_waiting (Chris Wilson)

    drm/sched: Always trace the dependencies we wait on, to fix a race.
    
    commit 82abf33766712d8446ea137a3400165e31bd12c7 upstream.
    
    The entity->dependency can go away completely once we've called
    drm_sched_entity_add_dependency_cb() (if the cb is called before we
    get around to tracing).  The tracepoint is more useful if we trace
    every dependency instead of just ones that get callbacks installed,
    anyway, so just do that.
    
    Fixes any easy-to-produce OOPS when tracing the scheduler on V3D with
    "perf record -a -e gpu_scheduler:.\* glxgears" and DEBUG_SLAB enabled.

    dm thin: fix bug where bio that overwrites thin block ignores FUA
    
    commit 4ae280b4ee3463fa57bbe6eede26b97daff8a0f1 upstream.
    
    When provisioning a new data block for a virtual block, either because
    the block was previously unallocated or because we are breaking sharing,
    if the whole block of data is being overwritten the bio that triggered
    the provisioning is issued immediately, skipping copying or zeroing of
    the data block.
    
    When this bio completes the new mapping is inserted in to the pool's
    metadata by process_prepared_mapping(), where the bio completion is
    signaled to the upper layers.
    
    This completion is signaled without first committing the metadata.  If
    the bio in question has the REQ_FUA flag set and the system crashes
    right after its completion and before the next metadata commit, then the
    write is lost despite the REQ_FUA flag requiring that I/O completion for
    this request must only be signaled after the data has been committed to
    non-volatile storage.
    
    Fix this by deferring the completion of overwrite bios, with the REQ_FUA
    flag set, until after the metadata has been committed.

    dm crypt: don't overallocate the integrity tag space
    
    commit ff0c129d3b5ecb3df7c8f5e2236582bf745b6c5f upstream.
    
    bio_sectors() returns the value in the units of 512-byte sectors (no
    matter what the real sector size of the device).  dm-crypt multiplies
    bio_sectors() by on_disk_tag_size to calculate the space allocated for
    integrity tags.  If dm-crypt is running with sector size larger than
    512b, it allocates more data than is needed.
    
    Device Mapper trims the extra space when passing the bio to
    dm-integrity, so this bug didn't result in any visible misbehavior.
    But it must be fixed to avoid wasteful memory allocation for the block
    integrity payload.

    sunrpc: fix 4 more call sites that were using stack memory with a scatterlist
    
    commit e7afe6c1d486b516ed586dcc10b3e7e3e85a9c2b upstream.
    
    While trying to reproduce a reported kernel panic on arm64, I discovered
    that AUTH_GSS basically doesn't work at all with older enctypes on arm64
    systems with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK enabled.  It turns out there still a few
    places using stack memory with scatterlists, causing krb5_encrypt() and
    krb5_decrypt() to produce incorrect results (or a BUG if CONFIG_DEBUG_SG
    is enabled).
    
    Tested with cthon on v4.0/v4.1/v4.2 with krb5/krb5i/krb5p using
    des3-cbc-sha1 and arcfour-hmac-md5.

    md/raid1: don't clear bitmap bits on interrupted recovery.

    sync_request_write no longer submits writes to a Faulty device. This has
    the unfortunate side effect that bitmap bits can be incorrectly cleared
    if a recovery is interrupted (previously, end_sync_write would have
    prevented this). This means the next recovery may not copy everything
    it should, potentially corrupting data.
    
    Add a function for doing the proper md_bitmap_end_sync, called from
    end_sync_write and the Faulty case in sync_request_write.

    crypto: ccree - fix resume race condition on init
    
    commit 1358c13a48c43f5e4de0c1835291837a27b9720c upstream.
    
    We were enabling autosuspend, which is using data set by the
    hash module, prior to the hash module being inited, casuing
    a crash on resume as part of the startup sequence if the race
    was lost.
    
    This was never a real problem because the PM infra was using low
    res timers so we were always winning the race, until commit 8234f6734c5d
    ("PM-runtime: Switch autosuspend over to using hrtimers") changed that :-)
    
    Fix this by seperating the PM setup and enablement and doing the
    latter only at the end of the init sequence.

    signal: Restore the stop PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT
    
    commit cf43a757fd49442bc38f76088b70c2299eed2c2f upstream.
    
    In the middle of do_exit() there is there is a call
    "ptrace_event(PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT, code);" That call places the process
    in TACKED_TRACED aka "(TASK_WAKEKILL | __TASK_TRACED)" and waits for
    for the debugger to release the task or SIGKILL to be delivered.
    
    Skipping past dequeue_signal when we know a fatal signal has already
    been delivered resulted in SIGKILL remaining pending and
    TIF_SIGPENDING remaining set.  This in turn caused the
    scheduler to not sleep in PTACE_EVENT_EXIT as it figured
    a fatal signal was pending.  This also caused ptrace_freeze_traced
    in ptrace_check_attach to fail because it left a per thread
    SIGKILL pending which is what fatal_signal_pending tests for.
    
    This difference in signal state caused strace to report
    strace: Exit of unknown pid NNNNN ignored
    
    Therefore update the signal handling state like dequeue_signal
    would when removing a per thread SIGKILL, by removing SIGKILL
    from the per thread signal mask and clearing TIF_SIGPENDING.

    scsi: sd: fix entropy gathering for most rotational disks
    
    commit e4a056987c86f402f1286e050b1dee3f4ce7c7eb upstream.
    
    The problem is that the default for MQ is not to gather entropy, whereas
    the default for the legacy queue was always to gather it.  The original
    attempt to fix entropy gathering for rotational disks under MQ added an
    else branch in sd_read_block_characteristics().  Unfortunately, the entire
    check isn't reached if the device has no characteristics VPD page.  Since
    this page was only introduced in SBC-3 and its optional anyway, most less
    expensive rotational disks don't have one, meaning they all stopped
    gathering entropy when we made MQ the default.  In a wholly unrelated
    change, openssl and openssh won't function until the random number
    generator is initialised, meaning lots of people have been seeing large
    delays before they could log into systems with default MQ kernels due to
    this lack of entropy, because it now can take tens of minutes to initialise
    the kernel random number generator.
    
    The fix is to set the non-rotational and add-randomness flags
    unconditionally early on in the disk initialization path, so they can be
    reset only if the device actually reports being non-rotational via the VPD
    page.

    powerpc/64s: Fix possible corruption on big endian due to pgd/pud_present()
    
    commit a58007621be33e9f7c7bed5d5ff8ecb914e1044a upstream.
    
    In v4.20 we changed our pgd/pud_present() to check for _PAGE_PRESENT
    rather than just checking that the value is non-zero, e.g.:
    
      static inline int pgd_present(pgd_t pgd)
      {
     -       return !pgd_none(pgd);
     +       return (pgd_raw(pgd) & cpu_to_be64(_PAGE_PRESENT));
      }
    
    Unfortunately this is broken on big endian, as the result of the
    bitwise & is truncated to int, which is always zero because
    _PAGE_PRESENT is 0x8000000000000000ul. This means pgd_present() and
    pud_present() are always false at compile time, and the compiler
    elides the subsequent code.
    
    Remarkably with that bug present we are still able to boot and run
    with few noticeable effects. However under some work loads we are able
    to trigger a warning in the ext4 code:
    
      WARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 29593 at fs/ext4/inode.c:3927 .ext4_set_page_dirty+0x70/0xb0

    The fix is simple, we need to convert the result of the bitwise & to
    an int before returning it.

    tracing: probeevent: Correctly update remaining space in dynamic area
    
    commit f6675872db57305fa957021efc788f9983ed3b67 upstream.
    
    Commit 9178412ddf5a ("tracing: probeevent: Return consumed
    bytes of dynamic area") improved the string fetching
    mechanism by returning the number of required bytes after
    copying the argument to the dynamic area. However, this
    return value is now only used to increment the pointer
    inside the dynamic area but misses updating the 'maxlen'
    variable which indicates the remaining space in the dynamic
    area.
    
    This means that fetch_store_string() always reads the *total*
    size of the dynamic area from the data_loc pointer instead of
    the *remaining* size (and passes it along to
    strncpy_from_{user,unsafe}) even if we're already about to
    copy data into the middle of the dynamic area.

    s390/zcrypt: fix specification exception on z196 during ap probe
    
    commit 8f9aca0c45322a807a343fc32f95f2500f83b9ae upstream.
    
    The older machines don't have the QCI instruction available.
    With support for up to 256 crypto cards the probing of each
    card has been extended to check card ids from 0 up to 255.
    For machines with QCI support there is a filter limiting the
    range of probed cards. The older machines (z196 and older)
    don't have this filter and so since support for 256 cards is
    in the driver all cards are probed. However, these machines
    also require to have the card id fit into 6 bits. Exceeding
    this limit results in a specification exception which happens
    on every kernel startup even when there is no crypto configured
    and used at all.
    
    This fix limits the range of probed crypto cards to 64 if
    there is no QCI instruction available to obey to the older
    ap architecture and so fixes the specification exceptions
    on z196 machines.

    alpha: Fix Eiger NR_IRQS to 128
    
    commit bfc913682464f45bc4d6044084e370f9048de9d5 upstream.
    
    Eiger machine vector definition has nr_irqs 128, and working 2.6.26
    boot shows SCSI getting IRQ-s 64 and 65. Current kernel boot fails
    because Symbios SCSI fails to request IRQ-s and does not find the disks.
    It has been broken at least since 3.18 - the earliest I could test with
    my gcc-5.
    
    The headers have moved around and possibly another order of defines has
    worked in the past - but since 128 seems to be correct and used, fix
    arch/alpha/include/asm/irq.h to have NR_IRQS=128 for Eiger.
    
    This fixes 4.19-rc7 boot on my Force Flexor A264 (Eiger subarch).

    alpha: fix page fault handling for r16-r18 targets
    
    commit 491af60ffb848b59e82f7c9145833222e0bf27a5 upstream.
    
    Fix page fault handling code to fixup r16-r18 registers.
    Before the patch code had off-by-two registers bug.
    This bug caused overwriting of ps,pc,gp registers instead
    of fixing intended r16,r17,r18 (see `struct pt_regs`).
    
    More details:
    
    Initially Dmitry noticed a kernel bug as a failure
    on strace test suite. Test passes unmapped userspace
    pointer to io_submit:
    
    ```c
        #include <err.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
        #include <sys/mman.h>
        #include <asm/unistd.h>
        int main(void)
        {
            unsigned long ctx = 0;
            if (syscall(__NR_io_setup, 1, &ctx))
                err(1, "io_setup");
            const size_t page_size = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);
            const size_t size = page_size * 2;
            void *ptr = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                             MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
            if (MAP_FAILED == ptr)
                err(1, "mmap(%zu)", size);
            if (munmap(ptr, size))
                err(1, "munmap");
            syscall(__NR_io_submit, ctx, 1, ptr + page_size);
            syscall(__NR_io_destroy, ctx);
            return 0;
        }
    ```
    
    Running this test causes kernel to crash when handling page fault:
    
    ```

        Trace:
        [<fffffc0000311404>] entSys+0xa4/0xc0
    ```
    
    Here `gp` has invalid value. `gp is s overwritten by a fixup for the
    following page fault handler in `io_submit` syscall handler:
    
    ```
        __se_sys_io_submit
        ...
            ldq     a1,0(t1)
            bne     t0,4280 <__se_sys_io_submit+0x180>
    ```
    
    After a page fault `t0` should contain -EFALUT and `a1` is 0.
    Instead `gp` was overwritten in place of `a1`.
    
    This happens due to a off-by-two bug in `dpf_reg()` for `r16-r18`
    (aka `a0-a2`).
    
    I think the bug went unnoticed for a long time as `gp` is one
    of scratch registers. Any kernel function call would re-calculate `gp`.
    
    Dmitry tracked down the bug origin back to 2.1.32 kernel version
    where trap_a{0,1,2} fields were inserted into struct pt_regs.
    And even before that `dpf_reg()` contained off-by-one error.

    Revert "mm: slowly shrink slabs with a relatively small number of objects"
    
    commit a9a238e83fbb0df31c3b9b67003f8f9d1d1b6c96 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 172b06c32b9497 ("mm: slowly shrink slabs with a
    relatively small number of objects").
    
    This change changes the agressiveness of shrinker reclaim, causing small
    cache and low priority reclaim to greatly increase scanning pressure on
    small caches.  As a result, light memory pressure has a disproportionate
    affect on small caches, and causes large caches to be reclaimed much
    faster than previously.
    
    As a result, it greatly perturbs the delicate balance of the VFS caches
    (dentry/inode vs file page cache) such that the inode/dentry caches are
    reclaimed much, much faster than the page cache and this drives us into
    several other caching imbalance related problems.
    
    As such, this is a bad change and needs to be reverted.
    
    [ Needs some massaging to retain the later seekless shrinker
      modifications.]

    commit 69056ee6a8a3d576ed31e38b3b14c70d6c74edcc upstream.
    
    This reverts commit a76cf1a474d7d ("mm: don't reclaim inodes with many
    attached pages").
    
    This change causes serious changes to page cache and inode cache
    behaviour and balance, resulting in major performance regressions when
    combining worklaods such as large file copies and kernel compiles.
    
      https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202441
    
    This change is a hack to work around the problems introduced by changing
    how agressive shrinkers are on small caches in commit 172b06c32b94 ("mm:
    slowly shrink slabs with a relatively small number of objects").  It
    creates more problems than it solves, wasn't adequately reviewed or
    tested, so it needs to be reverted.

    Revert "nfsd4: return default lease period"
    
    commit 3bf6b57ec2ec945e5a6edf5c202a754f1e852ecd upstream.
    
    This reverts commit d6ebf5088f09472c1136cd506bdc27034a6763f8.
    
    I forgot that the kernel's default lease period should never be
    decreased!
    
    After a kernel upgrade, the kernel has no way of knowing on its own what
    the previous lease time was.  Unless userspace tells it otherwise, it
    will assume the previous lease period was the same.
    
    So if we decrease this value in a kernel upgrade, we end up enforcing a
    grace period that's too short, and clients will fail to reclaim state in
    time.  Symptoms may include EIO and log messages like "NFS:
    nfs4_reclaim_open_state: Lock reclaim failed!"
    
    There was no real justification for the lease period decrease anyway.

    Input: elantech - enable 3rd button support on Fujitsu CELSIUS H780
    
    commit e8b22d0a329f0fb5c7ef95406872d268f01ee3b1 upstream.
    
    Like Fujitsu CELSIUS H760, the H780 also has a three-button Elantech
    touchpad, but the driver needs to be told so to enable the middle touchpad
    button.
    
    The elantech_dmi_force_crc_enabled quirk was not necessary with the H780.
    
    Also document the fw_version and caps values detected for both H760 and
    H780 models.

    mmc: block: handle complete_work on separate workqueue
    
    commit dcf6e2e38a1c7ccbc535de5e1d9b14998847499d upstream.
    
    The kblockd workqueue is created with the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag set.
    This generates a rescuer thread for that queue that will trigger when
    the CPU is under heavy load and collect the uncompleted work.
    
    In the case of mmc, this creates the possibility of a deadlock when
    there are multiple partitions on the device as other blk-mq work is
    also run on the same queue. For example:
    
    - worker 0 claims the mmc host to work on partition 1
    - worker 1 attempts to claim the host for partition 2 but has to wait
      for worker 0 to finish
    - worker 0 schedules complete_work to release the host
    - rescuer thread is triggered after time-out and collects the dangling
      work
    - rescuer thread attempts to complete the work in order starting with
      claim host
    - the task to release host is now blocked by a task to claim it and
      will never be called
    
    The above results in multiple hung tasks that lead to failures to
    mount partitions.
    
    Handling complete_work on a separate workqueue avoids this by keeping
    the work completion tasks separate from the other blk-mq work. This
    allows the host to be released without getting blocked by other tasks
    attempting to claim the host.

    mmc: sunxi: Filter out unsupported modes declared in the device tree
    
    commit d6f11e7d91f2ac85f66194fe3ef8789b49901d64 upstream.
    
    The MMC device tree bindings include properties used to signal various
    signalling speed modes. Until now the sunxi driver was accepting them
    without any further filtering, while the sunxi device trees were not
    actually using them.
    
    Since some of the H5 boards can not run at higher speed modes stably,
    we are resorting to declaring the higher speed modes per-board.
    
    Regardless, having boards declare modes and blindly following them,
    even without proper support in the driver, is generally a bad thing.
    
    Filter out all unsupported modes from the capabilities mask after
    the device tree properties have been parsed.

    mmc: sunxi: Disable HS-DDR mode for H5 eMMC controller by default
    
    commit d49d92ace4974510dd5845ff91860823cf30dc08 upstream.
    
    Some H5 boards seem to not have proper trace lengths for eMMC to be able
    to use the default setting for the delay chains under HS-DDR mode. These
    include the Bananapi M2+ H5 and NanoPi NEO Core2. However the Libre
    Computer ALL-H3-CC-H5 works just fine.
    
    For the H5 (at least for now), default to not enabling HS-DDR modes in
    the driver, and expect the device tree to signal HS-DDR capability on
    boards that work.

    ALSA: pcm: Revert capture stream behavior change in blocking mode
    
    commit 00a399cad1a063e7665f06b6497a807db20441fd upstream.
    
    In the commit 62ba568f7aef ("ALSA: pcm: Return 0 when size <
    start_threshold in capture"), we changed the behavior of
    __snd_pcm_lib_xfer() to return immediately with 0 when a capture
    stream has a high start_threshold.  This was intended to be a
    correction of the behavior consistency and looked harmless, but this
    was the culprit of the recent breakage reported by syzkaller, which
    was fixed by the commit e190161f96b8 ("ALSA: pcm: Fix tight loop of
    OSS capture stream").
    
    At the time for the OSS fix, I didn't touch the behavior for ALSA
    native API, as assuming that this behavior actually is good.  But this
    turned out to be also broken actually for a similar deployment,
    e.g. one thread goes to a write loop in blocking mode while another
    thread controls the start/stop of the stream manually.
    
    Overall, the original commit is harmful, and it brings less merit to

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix implicit fb endpoint setup by quirk
    
    commit 2bc16b9f3223d049b57202ee702fcb5b9b507019 upstream.
    
    The commit a60945fd08e4 ("ALSA: usb-audio: move implicit fb quirks to
    separate function") introduced an error in the handling of quirks for
    implicit feedback endpoints. This commit fixes this.
    
    If a quirk successfully sets up an implicit feedback endpoint, usb-audio
    no longer tries to find the implicit fb endpoint itself.

    perf/x86: Add check_period PMU callback
    
    commit 81ec3f3c4c4d78f2d3b6689c9816bfbdf7417dbb upstream.
    
    Vince (and later on Ravi) reported crashes in the BTS code during

    The reason is that while event init code does several checks
    for BTS events and prevents several unwanted config bits for
    BTS event (like precise_ip), the PERF_EVENT_IOC_PERIOD allows
    to create BTS event without those checks being done.
    
    Following sequence will cause the crash:
    
    If we create an 'almost' BTS event with precise_ip and callchains,
    and it into a BTS event it will crash the perf_prepare_sample()
    function because precise_ip events are expected to come
    in with callchain data initialized, but that's not the
    case for intel_pmu_drain_bts_buffer() caller.
    
    Adding a check_period callback to be called before the period
    is changed via PERF_EVENT_IOC_PERIOD. It will deny the change
    if the event would become BTS. Plus adding also the limit_period
    check as well.

    perf/core: Fix impossible ring-buffer sizes warning
    
    commit 528871b456026e6127d95b1b2bd8e3a003dc1614 upstream.
    
    The following commit:
    
      9dff0aa95a32 ("perf/core: Don't WARN() for impossible ring-buffer sizes")
    
    results in perf recording failures with larger mmap areas:
    
      root@skl:/tmp# perf record -g -a
      failed to mmap with 12 (Cannot allocate memory)
    
    The root cause is that the following condition is buggy:
    
            if (order_base_2(size) >= MAX_ORDER)
                    goto fail;
    
    The problem is that @size is in bytes and MAX_ORDER is in pages,
    so the right test is:
    
            if (order_base_2(size) >= PAGE_SHIFT+MAX_ORDER)
                    goto fail;
    
    Fix it.

    ARM: OMAP5+: Fix inverted nirq pin interrupts with irq_set_type
    
    commit d0243693fbf6fbd48b4efb2ba7210765983b03e3 upstream.
    
    Commit 83a86fbb5b56 ("irqchip/gic: Loudly complain about the use of
    IRQ_TYPE_NONE") started warning about incorrect dts usage for irqs.
    ARM GIC only supports active-high interrupts for SPI (Shared Peripheral
    Interrupts), and the Palmas PMIC by default is active-low.
    
    Palmas PMIC allows changing the interrupt polarity using register
    PALMAS_POLARITY_CTRL_INT_POLARITY, but configuring sys_nirq1 with
    a pull-down and setting PALMAS_POLARITY_CTRL_INT_POLARITY made the
    Palmas RTC interrupts stop working. This can be easily tested with
    kernel tools rtctest.c.
    
    Turns out the SoC inverts the sys_nirq pins for GIC as they do not go
    through a peripheral device but go directly to the MPUSS wakeupgen.
    I've verified this by muxing the interrupt line temporarily to gpio_wk16
    instead of sys_nirq1. with a gpio, the interrupt works fine both
    active-low and active-high with the SoC internal pull configured and
    palmas polarity configured. But as sys_nirq1, the interrupt only works
    when configured ACTIVE_LOW for palmas, and ACTIVE_HIGH for GIC.
    
    Note that there was a similar issue earlier with tegra114 and palmas
    interrupt polarity that got fixed by commit df545d1cd01a ("mfd: palmas:
    Provide irq flags through DT/platform data"). However, the difference
    between omap5 and tegra114 is that tegra inverts the palmas interrupt
    twice, once when entering tegra PMC, and again when exiting tegra PMC
    to GIC.
    
    Let's fix the issue by adding a custom wakeupgen_irq_set_type() for
    wakeupgen and invert any interrupts with wrong polarity. Let's also
    warn about any non-sysnirq pins using wrong polarity. Note that we
    also need to update the dts for the level as IRQ_TYPE_NONE never
    has irq_set_type() called, and let's add some comments and use proper
    pin nameing to avoid more confusion later on.

    [ Upstream commit ee258d79159afed52ca9372aeb9c1a51e89b32ee ]
    
    Currently we account for credits in the thread initiating a request
    and waiting for a response. The demultiplex thread receives the response,
    wakes up the thread and the latter collects credits from the response
    buffer and add them to the server structure on the client. This approach
    is not accurate, because it may race with reconnect events in the
    demultiplex thread which resets the number of credits.
    
    Fix this by moving credit processing to new mid callbacks that collect
    credits granted by the server from the response in the demultiplex thread.

    If a request is cancelled, we can't assume that the server returns

    0 credits granted. The latter most probably happens together with
    session reconnect, so the client's credits are adjusted anyway.

    cifs: Limit memory used by lock request calls to a page
    
    [ Upstream commit 92a8109e4d3a34fb6b115c9098b51767dc933444 ]
    
    The code tries to allocate a contiguous buffer with a size supplied by
    the server (maxBuf). This could fail if memory is fragmented since it
    results in high order allocations for commonly used server
    implementations. It is also wasteful since there are probably
    few locks in the usual case. Limit the buffer to be no larger than a
    page to avoid memory allocation failures due to fragmentation.

    gpio: pl061: handle failed allocations
    
    [ Upstream commit df209c43a0e8258e096fb722dfbdae4f0dd13fde ]
    
    devm_kzalloc(), devm_kstrdup() and devm_kasprintf() all can
    fail internal allocation and return NULL. Using any of the assigned
    objects without checking is not safe. As this is early in the boot
    phase and these allocations really should not fail, any failure here
    is probably an indication of a more serious issue so it makes little
    sense to try and rollback the previous allocated resources or try to
    continue;  but rather the probe function is simply exited with -ENOMEM.

    [ Upstream commit 6299358d198a0635da2dd3c4b3ec37789e811e44 ]
    
    If a device provides an NQN it is expected to be globally unique.
    Unfortunately some firmware revisions for Intel 760p/Pro 7600p devices did
    not satisfy this requirement.  In these circumstances if a system has >1
    affected device then only one device is enabled.  If this quirk is enabled
    then the device supplied subnqn is ignored and we fallback to generating
    one as if the field was empty.  In this case we also suppress the version
    check so we don't print a warning when the quirk is enabled.

    [ Upstream commit 9a63bd6fe1b5590ffa42ae2ed22ee21363293e31 ]
    
    Initially DP0_SRCCTRL is set to a static value which includes
    DP0_SRCCTRL_LANES_2 and DP0_SRCCTRL_BW27, even when only 1 lane of
    1.62Gbps speed is used. DP1_SRCCTRL is configured to a magic number.
    
    This patch changes the configuration as follows:
    
    Configure DP0_SRCCTRL by using tc_srcctrl() which provides the correct
    value.
    
    DP1_SRCCTRL needs two bits to be set to the same value as DP0_SRCCTRL:
    SSCG and BW27. All other bits can be zero.

    [ Upstream commit 4842379cbe6e851de914a7132f76f4e200b9a98b ]
    
    tc358767 driver does not set DRM bus_flags, even if it does configures
    the polarity settings into its registers. This means that the DPI source
    can't configure the polarities correctly.
    
    Add sync flags accordingly.

    irqchip/csky: fixup handle_irq_perbit break irq
    
    [ Upstream commit 56752b21755aef598709d143684cb363db98a7d2 ]
    
    The handle_irq_perbit function loop every bit in hwirq local variable.
    
    handle_irq_perbit(hwirq) {
      for_everyt_bit_in(hwirq) {
            handle_domain_irq()
                    ->irq_exit()
                    ->invoke_softirq()
                    ->__do_softirq()
                    ->local_irq_enable() // Here will cause new interrupt.
      }
    }
    
    When new interrupt coming at local_irq_enable, it will finish another
    interrupt handler and pull down the interrupt source. But hwirq is the
    local variable for handle_irq_perbit(), it can't get new interrupt
    controller pending reg status. So we need update hwirq with pending reg
    in every loop.
    
    Also change write_relax to writel could prevent stw from fast retire.
    When local_irq is enabled, intc regs is really set-in.

    csky: fixup CACHEV1 store instruction fast retire
    
    [ Upstream commit 96354ad79e2e59f9d620669c8e1ac2452440c260 ]
    
    For I/O access, 810/807 store instruction fast retire will cause wrong
    primitive. For example:
    
            stw (clear interrupt source)
            stw (unmask interrupt controller)
            enable interrupt
    
    stw is fast retire instruction. When PC is run at enable interrupt
    stage, the clear interrupt source hasn't finished. It will cause another
    wrong irq-enter.
    
    So use mb() to prevent above.

    cpufreq: check if policy is inactive early in __cpufreq_get()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2f66196208c98b3d1b4294edffb2c5a8197be899 ]
    
    cpuinfo_cur_freq gets current CPU frequency as detected by hardware
    while scaling_cur_freq last known CPU frequency. Some platforms may not
    allow checking the CPU frequency of an offline CPU or the associated
    resources may have been released via cpufreq_exit when the CPU gets
    offlined, in which case the policy would have been invalidated already.
    If we attempt to get current frequency from the hardware, it may result
    in hang or crash.
    
    For example on Juno, I see:
    
    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000188

    tools uapi: fix RISC-V 64-bit support
    
    [ Upstream commit d0df00e30e4bf9bc27ddbd092ad683ff6121b360 ]
    
    The BPF library is not built on 64-bit RISC-V, as the BPF feature is
    not detected. Looking more in details, feature/test-bpf.c fails to build
    with the following error:
    
    | In file included from /tmp/linux-4.19.12/tools/include/uapi/asm/bitsperlong.h:17,
    |                  from /tmp/linux-4.19.12/tools/include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h:2,
    |                  from /usr/include/riscv64-linux-gnu/asm/unistd.h:1,

    | /tmp/linux-4.19.12/tools/include/asm-generic/bitsperlong.h:14:2: error: #error Inconsistent word size. Check asm/bitsperlong.h
    |  #error Inconsistent word size. Check asm/bitsperlong.h
    |   ^~~~~
    
    The UAPI from the tools directory is missing RISC-V support, therefore
    bitsperlong.h from asm-generic is used, defaulting to 32 bits.
    
    Fix that by adding tools/arch/riscv/include/uapi/asm/bitsperlong.h as
    a copy of arch/riscv/include/uapi/asm/bitsperlong.h and by updating
    tools/include/uapi/asm/bitsperlong.h.

    The workaround for the wrong hierarchy of the 3DG-{A,B} power domains on
    RZ/G2E ES1.0 corrected the parent domains. However, the 3DG-{A,B} power
    domains were still initialized and powered in the wrong order, causing
    3DG operation to fail.
    
    Fix this by changing the order in the table at runtime, when running on
    an affected SoC.
    
    This work is based on the work done by Geert for R-Car E3.

    perf test shell: Use a fallback to get the pathname in vfs_getname

    Some kernels, like 4.19.13-300.fc29.x86_64 in fedora 29, fail with the
    existing probe definition asking for the contents of result->name,
    working when we ask for the 'filename' variable instead, so add a
    fallback to that.
    
    Now those tests are back working on fedora 29 systems with that kernel:
    
      # perf test vfs_getname

      66: Add vfs_getname probe to get syscall args filenames   : Ok

    perf report: Fix wrong iteration count in --branch-history
    
    [ Upstream commit a3366db06bb656cef2e03f30f780d93059bcc594 ]
    
    By calculating the removed loops, we can get the iteration count.
    
    But the iteration count could be reported incorrectly, reporting
    impossibly high counts.
    
    That's because previous code uses the number of removed LBR entries for
    the iteration count. That's not good. Fix this by increasing the
    iteration count when a loop is detected.
    
    When matching the chain, the iteration count would be added up, finally we need
    to compute the average value when printing out.
    
    For example,
    
      $ perf report --branch-history --stdio --no-children
    
    Before:
    
      ---f2 +0
         |

         |          main +17

         |          f2 +27 (cycles:11)
         |          f2 +0
         |          f1 +9 (cycles:1 iter:2968 avg_cycles:3)

    perf stat: Fix endless wait for child process
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a99255a50c0b4c2a449b96fd8d45fcc8d72c701 ]
    
    We hit a 'perf stat' issue by using following script:
    
      #!/bin/bash
    
      sleep 1000 &
      exec perf stat -a -e cycles -I1000 -- sleep 5
    
    Since "perf stat" is launched by exec, the "sleep 1000" would be the
    child process of "perf stat". The wait4() call will not return because
    it's waiting for the child process "sleep 1000" to end. So 'perf stat'
    doesn't return even after 5s passes.
    
    This patch lets 'perf stat' return when the specified child process ends
    (in this case, the specified child process is "sleep 5").
    
    Committer testing:
    
      # cat test.sh
      #!/bin/bash
    
      sleep 10 &
      exec perf stat -a -e cycles -I1000 -- sleep 5

    ACPI: NUMA: Use correct type for printing addresses on i386-PAE
    
    [ Upstream commit b9ced18acf68dffebe6888c7ec765a2b1db7a039 ]
    
    The addresses of NUMA nodes are not printed correctly on i386-PAE
    which is misleading.
    
    Here is a debian9-32bit with PAE in a QEMU guest having more than 4G
    of memory:
    
    qemu-system-i386 \
    -hda /var/lib/libvirt/images/debian32.qcow2 \
    -m 5G \
    -enable-kvm \
    -smp 10 \
    -numa node,mem=512M,nodeid=0,cpus=0 \
    -numa node,mem=512M,nodeid=1,cpus=1 \
    -numa node,mem=512M,nodeid=2,cpus=2 \
    -numa node,mem=512M,nodeid=3,cpus=3 \
    -numa node,mem=512M,nodeid=4,cpus=4 \
    -numa node,mem=512M,nodeid=5,cpus=5 \
    -numa node,mem=512M,nodeid=6,cpus=6 \
    -numa node,mem=512M,nodeid=7,cpus=7 \
    -numa node,mem=512M,nodeid=8,cpus=8 \
    -numa node,mem=512M,nodeid=9,cpus=9 \
    -serial stdio
    
    Because of the wrong value type, it prints as below:
    
    [    0.021049] ACPI: SRAT Memory (0x0 length 0xa0000) in proximity domain 0 enabled

    [    0.027802] ACPI: SRAT Memory (0x60000000 length 0x20000000) in proximity domain 9 enabled
    
    The upper half of the start address of the NUMA domains between 6
    and 9 inclusive was cut, so the printed values are incorrect.
    
    Fix the value type, to get the correct values in the log as follows:

    blk-mq: fix a hung issue when fsync
    
    [ Upstream commit 85bd6e61f34dffa8ec2dc75ff3c02ee7b2f1cbce ]
    
    Florian reported a io hung issue when fsync(). It should be
    triggered by following race condition.
    
    data + post flush         a flush
    
    blk_flush_complete_seq
      case REQ_FSEQ_DATA
        blk_flush_queue_rq
        issued to driver      blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list
                                try to issue a flush req
                                failed due to NON-NCQ command
                                .queue_rq return BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE
    
    request completion
      req->end_io // doesn't check RESTART
      mq_flush_data_end_io
        case REQ_FSEQ_POSTFLUSH
          blk_kick_flush
            do nothing because previous flush
            has not been completed
         blk_mq_run_hw_queue
                                  insert rq to hctx->dispatch
                                  due to RESTART is still set, do nothing
    
    To fix this, replace the blk_mq_run_hw_queue in mq_flush_data_end_io
    with blk_mq_sched_restart to check and clear the RESTART flag.
