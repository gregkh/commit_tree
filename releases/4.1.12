    sched/preempt, powerpc, kvm: Use need_resched() instead of should_resched()
    
    commit c56dadf39761a6157239cac39e3988998c994f98 upstream.
    
    Function should_resched() is equal to (!preempt_count() && need_resched()).
    In preemptive kernel preempt_count here is non-zero because of vc->lock.

    sched/preempt, xen: Use need_resched() instead of should_resched()
    
    commit 0fa2f5cb2b0ecd8d56baa51f35f09aab234eb0bf upstream.
    
    This code is used only when CONFIG_PREEMPT=n and only in non-atomic context:
    xen_in_preemptible_hcall is set only in privcmd_ioctl_hypercall().
    Thus preempt_count is zero and should_resched() is equal to need_resched().

    nfs4: have do_vfs_lock take an inode pointer
    
    commit 83bfff23e9ed19f37c4ef0bba84e75bd88e5cf21 upstream.
    
    Now that we have file locking helpers that can deal with an inode
    instead of a filp, we can change the NFSv4 locking code to use that
    instead.
    
    This should fix the case where we have a filp that is closed while flock
    or OFD locks are set on it, and the task is signaled so that it doesn't
    wait for the LOCKU reply to come in before the filp is freed. At that
    point we can end up with a use-after-free with the current code, which
    relies on dereferencing the fl_file in the lock request.

    locks: have flock_lock_file take an inode pointer instead of a filp
    
    commit bcd7f78d078ff6197715c1ed070c92aca57ec12c upstream.
    
    ...and rename it to better describe how it works.
    
    In order to fix a use-after-free in NFS, we need to be able to remove
    locks from an inode after the filp associated with them may have already
    been freed. flock_lock_file already only dereferences the filp to get to
    the inode, so just change it so the callers do that.
    
    All of the callers already pass in a lock request that has the fl_file
    set properly, so we don't need to pass it in individually. With that
    change it now only dereferences the filp to get to the inode, so just
    push that out to the callers.

    svcrdma: handle rdma read with a non-zero initial page offset
    
    commit c91aed9896946721bb30705ea2904edb3725dd61 upstream.
    
    The server rdma_read_chunk_lcl() and rdma_read_chunk_frmr() functions
    were not taking into account the initial page_offset when determining
    the rdma read length.  This resulted in a read who's starting address
    and length exceeded the base/bounds of the frmr.
    
    The server gets an async error from the rdma device and kills the
    connection, and the client then reconnects and resends.  This repeats
    indefinitely, and the application hangs.
    
    Most work loads don't tickle this bug apparently, but one test hit it
    every time: building the linux kernel on a 16 core node with 'make -j
    16 O=/mnt/0' where /mnt/0 is a ramdisk mounted via NFSRDMA.
    
    This bug seems to only be tripped with devices having small fastreg page
    list depths.  I didn't see it with mlx4, for instance.

    arm64: Fix THP protection change logic
    
    commit 1a541b4e3cd6f5795022514114854b3e1345f24e upstream.
    
    6910fa1 ("arm64: enable PTE type bit in the mask for pte_modify") fixes
    a problem whereby a large block of PROT_NONE mapped memory is
    incorrectly mapped as block descriptors when mprotect is called.
    
    Unfortunately, a subtle bug was introduced by this fix to the THP logic.
    
    If one mmaps a large block of memory, then faults it such that it is
    collapsed into THPs; resulting calls to mprotect on this area of memory
    will lead to incorrect table descriptors being written instead of block
    descriptors. This is because pmd_modify calls pte_modify which is now
    allowed to modify the type of the page table entry.
    
    This patch reverts commit 6910fa16dbe142f6a0fd0fd7c249f9883ff7fc8a, and
    fixes the problem it was trying to address by adjusting PAGE_NONE to
    represent a table entry. Thus no change in pte type is required when
    moving from PROT_NONE to a different protection.

    pinctrl: imx25: ensure that a pin with id i is at position i in the info array
    
    commit 9911a2d5e9d14e39692b751929a92cb5a1d9d0e0 upstream.
    
    The code in pinctrl-imx.c only works correctly if in the
    imx_pinctrl_soc_info passed to imx_pinctrl_probe we have:
    
            info->pins[i].number = i
            conf_reg(info->pins[i]) = 4 * i
    
    (which conf_reg(pin) being the offset of the pin's configuration
    register).
    
    When the imx25 specific part was introduced in b4a87c9b966f ("pinctrl:
    pinctrl-imx: add imx25 pinctrl driver") we had:
    
            info->pins[i].number = i + 1
            conf_reg(info->pins[i]) = 4 * i
    
    . Commit 34027ca2bbc6 ("pinctrl: imx25: fix numbering for pins") tried
    to fix that but made the situation:
    
            info->pins[i-1].number = i
            conf_reg(info->pins[i-1]) = 4 * i
    
    which is hardly better but fixed the error seen back then.
    
    So insert another reserved entry in the array to finally yield:
    
            info->pins[i].number = i
            conf_reg(info->pins[i]) = 4 * i

    sched/preempt: Fix cond_resched_lock() and cond_resched_softirq()
    
    commit fe32d3cd5e8eb0f82e459763374aa80797023403 upstream.
    
    These functions check should_resched() before unlocking spinlock/bh-enable:
    preempt_count always non-zero => should_resched() always returns false.
    cond_resched_lock() worked iff spin_needbreak is set.
    
    This patch adds argument "preempt_offset" to should_resched().
    
    preempt_count offset constants for that:
    
      PREEMPT_DISABLE_OFFSET  - offset after preempt_disable()
      PREEMPT_LOCK_OFFSET     - offset after spin_lock()
      SOFTIRQ_DISABLE_OFFSET  - offset after local_bh_distable()
      SOFTIRQ_LOCK_OFFSET     - offset after spin_lock_bh()

    workqueue: make sure delayed work run in local cpu
    
    commit 874bbfe600a660cba9c776b3957b1ce393151b76 upstream.
    
    My system keeps crashing with below message. vmstat_update() schedules a delayed
    work in current cpu and expects the work runs in the cpu.
    schedule_delayed_work() is expected to make delayed work run in local cpu. The
    problem is timer can be migrated with NO_HZ. __queue_work() queues work in
    timer handler, which could run in a different cpu other than where the delayed
    work is scheduled. The end result is the delayed work runs in different cpu.
    The patch makes __queue_delayed_work records local cpu earlier. Where the timer
    runs doesn't change where the work runs with the change.

    i2c: designware: Do not use parameters from ACPI on Dell Inspiron 7348
    
    commit 56d4b8a24cef5d66f0d10ac778a520d3c2c68a48 upstream.
    
    ACPI SSCN/FMCN methods were originally added because then the platform can
    provide the most accurate HCNT/LCNT values to the driver. However, this
    seems not to be true for Dell Inspiron 7348 where using these causes the
    touchpad to fail in boot:
    
      i2c_hid i2c-DLL0675:00: failed to retrieve report from device.
      i2c_designware INT3433:00: i2c_dw_handle_tx_abort: lost arbitration
      i2c_hid i2c-DLL0675:00: failed to retrieve report from device.
      i2c_designware INT3433:00: controller timed out
    
    The values received from ACPI are (in fast mode):
    
      HCNT: 72
      LCNT: 160
    
    this translates to following timings (input clock is 100MHz on Broadwell):
    
      tHIGH: 720 ns (spec min 600 ns)
      tLOW: 1600 ns (spec min 1300 ns)
      Bus period: 2920 ns (assuming 300 ns tf and tr)
      Bus speed: 342.5 kHz
    
    Both tHIGH and tLOW are within the I2C specification.
    
    The calculated values when ACPI parameters are not used are (in fast mode):
    
      HCNT: 87
      LCNT: 159
    
    which translates to:
    
      tHIGH: 870 ns (spec min 600 ns)
      tLOW: 1590 ns (spec min 1300 ns)
      Bus period 3060 ns (assuming 300 ns tf and tr)
      Bus speed 326.8 kHz
    
    These values are also within the I2C specification.
    
    Since both ACPI and calculated values meet the I2C specification timing
    requirements it is hard to say why the touchpad does not function properly
    with the ACPI values except that the bus speed is higher in this case (but
    still well below the max 400kHz).
    
    Solve this by adding DMI quirk to the driver that disables using ACPI
    parameters on this particulare machine.

    Servers aren't really allowed to impose this kind of restriction on
    layouts; see RFC 5661 section 18.43.3 for details.

    arm64: errata: use KBUILD_CFLAGS_MODULE for erratum #843419
    
    commit b6dd8e0719c0d2d01429639a11b7bc2677de240c upstream.
    
    Commit df057cc7b4fa ("arm64: errata: add module build workaround for
    erratum #843419") sets CFLAGS_MODULE to ensure that the large memory
    model is used by the compiler when building kernel modules.
    
    However, CFLAGS_MODULE is an environment variable and intended to be
    overridden on the command line, which appears to be the case with the
    Ubuntu kernel packaging system, so use KBUILD_CFLAGS_MODULE instead.

    btrfs: fix use after free iterating extrefs
    
    commit dc6c5fb3b514221f2e9d21ee626a9d95d3418dff upstream.
    
    The code for btrfs inode-resolve has never worked properly for
    files with enough hard links to trigger extrefs.  It was trying to
    get the leaf out of a path after freeing the path:
    
            btrfs_release_path(path);
            leaf = path->nodes[0];
            item_size = btrfs_item_size_nr(leaf, slot);
    
    The fix here is to use the extent buffer we cloned just a little higher
    up to avoid deadlocks caused by using the leaf in the path.

    commit 8eb934591f8bf584969454a658f629cd06e59f3a upstream.
    
    We don't verify that all the balance filter arguments supplemented by
    the flags are actually known to the kernel. Thus we let it silently pass
    and do nothing.
    
    At the moment this means only the 'limit' filter, but we're going to add
    a few more soon so it's better to have that fixed. Also in older stable
    kernels so that it works with newer userspace tools.

    crypto: ahash - ensure statesize is non-zero
    
    commit 8996eafdcbad149ac0f772fb1649fbb75c482a6a upstream.
    
    Unlike shash algorithms, ahash drivers must implement export
    and import as their descriptors may contain hardware state and
    cannot be exported as is.  Unfortunately some ahash drivers did
    not provide them and end up causing crashes with algif_hash.
    
    This patch adds a check to prevent these drivers from registering
    ahash algorithms until they are fixed.

    drm: Fix locking for sysfs dpms file
    
    commit 621bd0f6982badd6483acb191eb7b6226a578328 upstream.
    
    With atomic drivers we need to make sure that (at least in general)
    property reads hold the right locks. But the legacy dpms property is
    special and can be read locklessly. Since userspace loves to just
    randomly look at that all the time (like with "status") do that.
    
    To make it clear that we play tricks use the READ_ONCE compiler
    barrier (and also for paranoia).
    
    Note that there's not really anything bad going on since even with the
    new atomic paths we eventually end up not chasing any pointers (and
    hence possibly freed memory and other fun stuff). The locking WARNING
    has been added in

    Unfortunately we take into account the peek offset for each skb,

    In addition, the peek offset should be used only if MSG_PEEK is set.

    http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/8/444 calling recv() with MSG_PEEK on an
    AF_UNIX socket only reads a single skb, where the desired effect is
    to return as much skb data has been queued, until hitting the recv
    buffer size (whichever comes first).
    
    The modified MSG_PEEK path will now move to the next skb in the tree
    and jump to the again: label, rather than following the natural loop
    structure. This requires duplicating some of the loop head actions.
    
    This was tested using the python socketpair python code attached to
    the bugzilla issue.

    netlink: Trim skb to alloc size to avoid MSG_TRUNC
    
    [ Upstream commit db65a3aaf29ecce2e34271d52e8d2336b97bd9fe ]
    
    netlink_dump() allocates skb based on the calculated min_dump_alloc or
    a per socket max_recvmsg_len.
    min_alloc_size is maximum space required for any single netdev
    attributes as calculated by rtnl_calcit().
    max_recvmsg_len tracks the user provided buffer to netlink_recvmsg.
    It is capped at 16KiB.
    The intention is to avoid small allocations and to minimize the number
    of calls required to obtain dump information for all net devices.
    
    netlink_dump packs as many small messages as could fit within an skb
    that was sized for the largest single netdev information. The actual
    space available within an skb is larger than what is requested. It could
    be much larger and up to near 2x with align to next power of 2 approach.
    
    Allowing netlink_dump to use all the space available within the
    allocated skb increases the buffer size a user has to provide to avoid
    truncaion (i.e. MSG_TRUNG flag set).
    
    It was observed that with many VLANs configured on at least one netdev,
    a larger buffer of near 64KiB was necessary to avoid "Message truncated"
    error in "ip link" or "bridge [-c[ompressvlans]] vlan show" when
    min_alloc_size was only little over 32KiB.
    
    This patch trims skb to allocated size in order to allow the user to
    avoid truncation with more reasonable buffer size.

    tipc: move fragment importance field to new header position
    
    [ Upstream commit dde4b5ae65de659b9ec64bafdde0430459fcb495 ]
    
    In commit e3eea1eb47a ("tipc: clean up handling of message priorities")
    we introduced a field in the packet header for keeping track of the
    priority of fragments, since this value is not present in the specified
    protocol header. Since the value so far only is used at the transmitting
    end of the link, we have not yet officially defined it as part of the
    protocol.
    
    Unfortunately, the field we use for keeping this value, bits 13-15 in
    in word 5, has turned out to be a poor choice; it is already used by the
    broadcast protocol for carrying the 'network id' field of the sending
    node. Since packet fragments also need to be transported across the
    broadcast protocol, the risk of conflict is obvious, and we see this
    happen when we use network identities larger than 2^13-1. This has
    escaped our testing because we have so far only been using small network
    id values.
    
    We now move this field to bits 0-2 in word 9, a field that is guaranteed
    to be unused by all involved protocols.

    bpf: fix panic in SO_GET_FILTER with native ebpf programs
    
    [ Upstream commit 93d08b6966cf730ea669d4d98f43627597077153 ]
    
    When sockets have a native eBPF program attached through
    setsockopt(sk, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_BPF, ...), and then try to
    dump these over getsockopt(sk, SOL_SOCKET, SO_GET_FILTER, ...),
    the following panic appears:

    The underlying issue is the very same as in commit b382c0865600
    ("sock, diag: fix panic in sock_diag_put_filterinfo"), that is,
    native eBPF programs don't store an original program since this
    is only needed in cBPF ones.
    
    However, sk_get_filter() wasn't updated to test for this at the
    time when eBPF could be attached. Just throw an error to the user
    to indicate that eBPF cannot be dumped over this interface.
    That way, it can also be known that a program _is_ attached (as
    opposed to just return 0), and a different (future) method needs
    to be consulted for a dump.

    reqsk_timer_handler() tests if icsk_accept_queue.listen_opt
    is NULL at its beginning.
    
    By the time it calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop() and
    reqsk_queue_unlink(), listener might have been closed and
    inet_csk_listen_stop() had called reqsk_queue_yank_acceptq()
    which sets icsk_accept_queue.listen_opt to NULL
    
    We therefore need to correctly check listen_opt being NULL
    after holding syn_wait_lock for proper synchronization.

    Since commit 2b018d57ff18 ("pppoe: drop PPPOX_ZOMBIEs in pppoe_release"),

    net: add pfmemalloc check in sk_add_backlog()
    
    [ Upstream commit c7c49b8fde26b74277188bdc6c9dca38db6fa35b ]
    
    Greg reported crashes hitting the following check in __sk_backlog_rcv()
    
            BUG_ON(!sock_flag(sk, SOCK_MEMALLOC));
    
    The pfmemalloc bit is currently checked in sk_filter().
    
    This works correctly for TCP, because sk_filter() is ran in
    tcp_v[46]_rcv() before hitting the prequeue or backlog checks.
    
    For UDP or other protocols, this does not work, because the sk_filter()
    is ran from sock_queue_rcv_skb(), which might be called _after_ backlog
    queuing if socket is owned by user by the time packet is processed by
    softirq handler.

    skbuff: Fix skb checksum partial check.
    
    [ Upstream commit 31b33dfb0a144469dd805514c9e63f4993729a48 ]
    
    Earlier patch 6ae459bda tried to detect void ckecksum partial
    skb by comparing pull length to checksum offset. But it does
    not work for all cases since checksum-offset depends on
    updates to skb->data.
    
    Following patch fixes it by validating checksum start offset
    after skb-data pointer is updated. Negative value of checksum
    offset start means there is no need to checksum.

    skbuff: Fix skb checksum flag on skb pull
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ae459bdaaeebc632b16e54dcbabb490c6931d61 ]
    
    VXLAN device can receive skb with checksum partial. But the checksum
    offset could be in outer header which is pulled on receive. This results
    in negative checksum offset for the skb. Such skb can cause the assert
    failure in skb_checksum_help(). Following patch fixes the bug by setting
    checksum-none while pulling outer header.
    
    Following is the kernel panic msg from old kernel hitting the bug.

    net/ibm/emac: bump version numbers for correct work with ethtool
    
    [ Upstream commit 661dfc65f7981481ba2e31aaa702371e82336e56 ]
    
    The size of the MAC register dump used to be the size specified by the
    reg property in the device tree.  Userland has no good way of finding
    out that size, and it was not specified consistently for each MAC type,
    so ethtool would end up printing junk at the end of the register dump
    if the device tree didn't match the size it assumed.
    
    Using the new version numbers indicates unambiguously that the size of
    the MAC register dump is dependent only on the MAC type.
