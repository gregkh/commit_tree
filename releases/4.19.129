    perf symbols: Fix debuginfo search for Ubuntu
    
    commit 85afd35575a3c1a3a905722dde5ee70b49282e70 upstream.
    
    Reportedly, from 19.10 Ubuntu has begun mixing up the location of some
    debug symbol files, putting files expected to be in
    /usr/lib/debug/usr/lib into /usr/lib/debug/lib instead. Fix by adding
    another dso_binary_type.
    
    Example on Ubuntu 20.04
    
      Before:

    perf probe: Check address correctness by map instead of _etext
    
    commit 2ae5d0d7d8868df7c05c2013c0b9cddd4d40610e upstream.
    
    Since commit 03db8b583d1c ("perf tools: Fix
    maps__find_symbol_by_name()") introduced map address range check in
    maps__find_symbol_by_name(), we can not get "_etext" from kernel map
    because _etext is placed on the edge of the kernel .text section (=
    kernel map in perf.)
    
    To fix this issue, this checks the address correctness by map address
    range information (map->start and map->end) instead of using _etext
    address.
    
    This can cause an error if the target inlined function is embedded in
    both __init function and normal function.
    
    For exaample, request_resource() is a normal function but also embedded
    in __init reserve_setup(). In this case, the probe point in
    reserve_setup() must be skipped.
    
    However, without this fix, it failes to setup all probe points:
    
      # ./perf probe -v request_resource
      probe-definition(0): request_resource
      symbol:request_resource file:(null) line:0 offset:0 return:0 lazy:(null)

    perf probe: Fix to check blacklist address correctly
    
    commit 80526491c2ca6abc028c0f0dbb0707a1f35fb18a upstream.
    
    Fix to check kprobe blacklist address correctly with relocated address
    by adjusting debuginfo address.
    
    Since the address in the debuginfo is same as objdump, it is different
    from relocated kernel address with KASLR.  Thus, 'perf probe' always
    misses to catch the blacklisted addresses.
    
    Without this patch, 'perf probe' can not detect the blacklist addresses
    on a KASLR enabled kernel.
    
      # perf probe kprobe_dispatcher
      Failed to write event: Invalid argument
        Error: Failed to add events.
      #
    
    With this patch, it correctly shows the error message.
    
      # perf probe kprobe_dispatcher
      kprobe_dispatcher is blacklisted function, skip it.
      Probe point 'kprobe_dispatcher' not found.

    perf probe: Do not show the skipped events
    
    commit f41ebe9defacddeae96a872a33f0f22ced0bfcef upstream.
    
    When a probe point is expanded to several places (like inlined) and if
    some of them are skipped because of blacklisted or __init function,
    those trace_events has no event name. It must be skipped while showing
    results.
    
    Without this fix, you can see "(null):(null)" on the list,
    
      # ./perf probe request_resource
      reserve_setup is out of .text, skip it.

    commit f51466901c07e6930435d30b02a21f0841174f61 upstream.
    
    nand_cleanup() is supposed to be called on error after a successful
    call to nand_scan() to free all NAND resources.
    
    There is no real Fixes tag applying here as the use of nand_release()
    in this driver predates by far the introduction of nand_cleanup() in
    commit d44154f969a4 ("mtd: nand: Provide nand_cleanup() function to free NAND related resources")
    which makes this change possible, hence pointing it as the commit to
    fix for backporting purposes, even if this commit is not introducing
    any bug.

    sunrpc: clean up properly in gss_mech_unregister()
    
    commit 24c5efe41c29ee3e55bcf5a1c9f61ca8709622e8 upstream.
    
    gss_mech_register() calls svcauth_gss_register_pseudoflavor() for each
    flavour, but gss_mech_unregister() does not call auth_domain_put().
    This is unbalanced and makes it impossible to reload the module.
    
    Change svcauth_gss_register_pseudoflavor() to return the registered
    auth_domain, and save it for later release.

    sunrpc: svcauth_gss_register_pseudoflavor must reject duplicate registrations.
    
    commit d47a5dc2888fd1b94adf1553068b8dad76cec96c upstream.
    
    There is no valid case for supporting duplicate pseudoflavor
    registrations.
    Currently the silent acceptance of such registrations is hiding a bug.
    The rpcsec_gss_krb5 module registers 2 flavours but does not unregister
    them, so if you load, unload, reload the module, it will happily
    continue to use the old registration which now has pointers to the
    memory were the module was originally loaded.  This could lead to
    unexpected results.
    
    So disallow duplicate registrations.

    This code does not work as stated in the comment.
    
    $(CONFIG_MODVERSIONS) is always empty because it is expanded before
    include/config/auto.conf is included. Hence, 'make modules' with
    CONFIG_MODVERSION=y cannot record the version CRCs.

    powerpc/64s: Save FSCR to init_task.thread.fscr after feature init
    
    commit 912c0a7f2b5daa3cbb2bc10f303981e493de73bd upstream.
    
    At boot the FSCR is initialised via one of two paths. On most systems
    it's set to a hard coded value in __init_FSCR().
    
    On newer skiboot systems we use the device tree CPU features binding,
    where firmware can tell Linux what bits to set in FSCR (and HFSCR).
    
    In both cases the value that's configured at boot is not propagated
    into the init_task.thread.fscr value prior to the initial fork of init
    (pid 1), which means the value is not used by any processes other than
    swapper (the idle task).
    
    For the __init_FSCR() case this is OK, because the value in
    init_task.thread.fscr is initialised to something sensible. However it
    does mean that the value set in __init_FSCR() is not used other than
    for swapper, which is odd and confusing.
    
    The bigger problem is for the device tree CPU features case it
    prevents firmware from setting (or clearing) FSCR bits for use by user
    space. This means all existing kernels can not have features
    enabled/disabled by firmware if those features require
    setting/clearing FSCR bits.
    
    We can handle both cases by saving the FSCR value into
    init_task.thread.fscr after we have initialised it at boot. This fixes
    the bug for device tree CPU features, and will allow us to simplify
    the initialisation for the __init_FSCR() case in a future patch.

    powerpc/64s: Don't let DT CPU features set FSCR_DSCR
    
    commit 993e3d96fd08c3ebf7566e43be9b8cd622063e6d upstream.
    
    The device tree CPU features binding includes FSCR bit numbers which
    Linux is instructed to set by firmware.
    
    Whether that's a good idea or not, in the case of the DSCR the Linux
    implementation has a hard requirement that the FSCR_DSCR bit not be
    set by default. We use it to track when a process reads/writes to
    DSCR, so it must be clear to begin with.
    
    So if firmware tells us to set FSCR_DSCR we must ignore it.
    
    Currently this does not cause a bug in our DSCR handling because the
    value of FSCR that the device tree CPU features code establishes is
    only used by swapper. All other tasks use the value hard coded in
    init_task.thread.fscr.
    
    However we'd like to fix that in a future commit, at which point this
    will become necessary.

    drivers/macintosh: Fix memleak in windfarm_pm112 driver
    
    commit 93900337b9ac2f4eca427eff6d187be2dc3b5551 upstream.
    
    create_cpu_loop() calls smu_sat_get_sdb_partition() which does
    kmalloc() and returns the allocated buffer. In fact it's called twice,
    and neither buffer is freed.
    
    This results in a memory leak as reported by Erhard:
      unreferenced object 0xc00000047081f840 (size 32):

    ARM: dts: exynos: Fix GPIO polarity for thr GalaxyS3 CM36651 sensor's bus
    
    commit 8807d356bfea92b0a8f04ce421800ed83400cd22 upstream.
    
    GPIO lines for the CM36651 sensor I2C bus use the normal not the inverted
    polarity. This bug has been there since adding the CM36651 sensor by
    commit 85cb4e0bd229 ("ARM: dts: add cm36651 light/proximity sensor node
    for exynos4412-trats2"), but went unnoticed because the "i2c-gpio"
    driver ignored the GPIO polarity specified in the device-tree.
    
    The recent conversion of "i2c-gpio" driver to the new, descriptor based
    GPIO API, automatically made it the DT-specified polarity aware, what
    broke the CM36651 sensor operation.

    commit 35509737c8f958944e059d501255a0bf18361ba0 upstream.
    
    The PL310 Auxiliary Control Register shouldn't have the "Full line of

    kernel/cpu_pm: Fix uninitted local in cpu_pm
    
    commit b5945214b76a1f22929481724ffd448000ede914 upstream.
    
    cpu_pm_notify() is basically a wrapper of notifier_call_chain().
    notifier_call_chain() doesn't initialize *nr_calls to 0 before it
    starts incrementing it--presumably it's up to the callers to do this.
    
    Unfortunately the callers of cpu_pm_notify() don't init *nr_calls.
    This potentially means you could get too many or two few calls to
    CPU_PM_ENTER_FAILED or CPU_CLUSTER_PM_ENTER_FAILED depending on the
    luck of the stack.
    
    Let's fix this.

    alpha: fix memory barriers so that they conform to the specification
    
    commit 54505a1e2083fc54cbe8779b97479f969cd30a00 upstream.
    
    The commits cd0e00c10672 and 92d7223a7423 broke boot on the Alpha Avanti
    platform. The patches move memory barriers after a write before the write.
    The result is that if there's iowrite followed by ioread, there is no
    barrier between them.
    
    The Alpha architecture allows reordering of the accesses to the I/O space,
    and the missing barrier between write and read causes hang with serial
    port and real time clock.
    
    This patch makes barriers confiorm to the specification.
    
    1. We add mb() before readX_relaxed and writeX_relaxed -
       memory-barriers.txt claims that these functions must be ordered w.r.t.
       each other. Alpha doesn't order them, so we need an explicit barrier.
    2. We add mb() before reads from the I/O space - so that if there's a
       write followed by a read, there should be a barrier between them.

    pinctrl: samsung: Save/restore eint_mask over suspend for EINT_TYPE GPIOs
    
    commit f354157a7d184db430c1a564c506434e33b1bec5 upstream.
    
    Currently, for EINT_TYPE GPIOs, the CON and FLTCON registers
    are saved and restored over a suspend/resume cycle.  However, the
    EINT_MASK registers are not.
    
    On S5PV210 at the very least, these registers are not retained over
    suspend, leading to the interrupts remaining masked upon resume and
    therefore no interrupts being triggered for the device.  There should
    be no effect on any SoCs that do retain these registers as theoretically
    we would just be re-writing what was already there.

    igb: Report speed and duplex as unknown when device is runtime suspended
    
    commit 165ae7a8feb53dc47fb041357e4b253bfc927cf9 upstream.
    
    igb device gets runtime suspended when there's no link partner. We can't
    get correct speed under that state:
    $ cat /sys/class/net/enp3s0/speed
    1000
    
    In addition to that, an error can also be spotted in dmesg:
    [  385.991957] igb 0000:03:00.0 enp3s0: PCIe link lost
    
    Since device can only be runtime suspended when there's no link partner,
    we can skip reading register and let the following logic set speed and
    duplex with correct status.
    
    The more generic approach will be wrap get_link_ksettings() with begin()
    and complete() callbacks. However, for this particular issue, begin()
    calls igb_runtime_resume() , which tries to rtnl_lock() while the lock
    is already hold by upper ethtool layer.
    
    So let's take this approach until the igb_runtime_resume() no longer
    needs to hold rtnl_lock.

    commit bfcba38d95a0aed146a958a84a2177af1459eddc upstream.
    
    v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() uses hdl->lock, which in ov5640 driver is set
    to sensor's own sensor->lock. In ov5640_remove(), the driver destroys the
    sensor->lock first, and then calls v4l2_ctrl_handler_free(), resulting
    in the use of the destroyed mutex.
    
    Fix this by calling moving the mutex_destroy() to the end of the cleanup
    sequence, as there's no need to destroy the mutex as early as possible.

    b43_legacy: Fix connection problem with WPA3
    
    commit 6a29d134c04a8acebb7a95251acea7ad7abba106 upstream.
    
    Since the driver was first introduced into the kernel, it has only
    handled the ciphers associated with WEP, WPA, and WPA2. It fails with
    WPA3 even though mac80211 can handle those additional ciphers in software,
    b43legacy did not report that it could handle them. By setting MFP_CAPABLE using
    ieee80211_set_hw(), the problem is fixed.
    
    With this change, b43legacy will handle the ciphers it knows in hardware,
    and let mac80211 handle the others in software. It is not necessary to
    use the module parameter NOHWCRYPT to turn hardware encryption off.
    Although this change essentially eliminates that module parameter,
    I am choosing to keep it for cases where the hardware is broken,
    and software encryption is required for all ciphers.

    b43legacy: Fix case where channel status is corrupted
    
    commit ec4d3e3a054578de34cd0b587ab8a1ac36f629d9 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes commit 75388acd0cd8 ("add mac80211-based driver for
    legacy BCM43xx devices")
    
    In https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=207093, a defect in
    b43legacy is reported. Upon testing, thus problem exists on PPC and
    X86 platforms, is present in the oldest kernel tested (3.2), and
    has been present in the driver since it was first added to the kernel.
    
    The problem is a corrupted channel status received from the device.
    Both the internal card in a PowerBook G4 and the PCMCIA version
    (Broadcom BCM4306 with PCI ID 14e4:4320) have the problem. Only Rev, 2
    (revision 4 of the 802.11 core) of the chip has been tested. No other
    devices using b43legacy are available for testing.
    
    Various sources of the problem were considered. Buffer overrun and
    other sources of corruption within the driver were rejected because
    the faulty channel status is always the same, not a random value.
    It was concluded that the faulty data is coming from the device, probably
    due to a firmware bug. As that source is not available, the driver
    must take appropriate action to recover.
    
    At present, the driver reports the error, and them continues to process
    the bad packet. This is believed that to be a mistake, and the correct
    action is to drop the correpted packet.

    e1000e: Relax condition to trigger reset for ME workaround
    
    commit d601afcae2febc49665008e9a79e701248d56c50 upstream.
    
    It's an error if the value of the RX/TX tail descriptor does not match
    what was written. The error condition is true regardless the duration
    of the interference from ME. But the driver only performs the reset if
    E1000_ICH_FWSM_PCIM2PCI_COUNT (2000) iterations of 50us delay have
    transpired. The extra condition can lead to inconsistency between the
    state of hardware as expected by the driver.
    
    Fix this by dropping the check for number of delay iterations.
    
    While at it, also make __ew32_prepare() static as it's not used
    anywhere else.

    Root Complex Integrated Endpoints (RCiEPs) do not have an upstream bridge,
    so pci_configure_mps() previously ignored them, which may result in reduced
    performance.
    
    Instead, program the Max_Payload_Size of RCiEPs to the maximum supported
    value (unless it is limited for the PCIE_BUS_PEER2PEER case).  This also
    affects the subsequent programming of Max_Read_Request_Size because Linux
    programs MRRS based on the MPS value.

    btrfs: fix wrong file range cleanup after an error filling dealloc range
    
    [ Upstream commit e2c8e92d1140754073ad3799eb6620c76bab2078 ]
    
    If an error happens while running dellaloc in COW mode for a range, we can
    end up calling extent_clear_unlock_delalloc() for a range that goes beyond
    our range's end offset by 1 byte, which affects 1 extra page. This results
    in clearing bits and doing page operations (such as a page unlock) outside
    our target range.
    
    Fix that by calling extent_clear_unlock_delalloc() with an inclusive end
    offset, instead of an exclusive end offset, at cow_file_range().

    btrfs: fix error handling when submitting direct I/O bio
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d3113a193e3385c72240096fe397618ecab6e43 ]
    
    In btrfs_submit_direct_hook(), if a direct I/O write doesn't span a RAID
    stripe or chunk, we submit orig_bio without cloning it. In this case, we
    don't increment pending_bios. Then, if btrfs_submit_dio_bio() fails, we
    decrement pending_bios to -1, and we never complete orig_bio. Fix it by
    initializing pending_bios to 1 instead of incrementing later.
    
    Fixing this exposes another bug: we put orig_bio prematurely and then
    put it again from end_io. Fix it by not putting orig_bio.
    
    After this change, pending_bios is really more of a reference count, but
    I'll leave that cleanup separate to keep the fix small.

    PCI: Generalize multi-function power dependency device links
    
    [ Upstream commit a17beb1a0882a544523dcb5d0da4801272dfd43a ]
    
    Although not allowed by the PCI specs, some multi-function devices have
    power dependencies between the functions.  For example, function 1 may not
    work unless function 0 is in the D0 power state.
    
    The existing quirk_gpu_hda() adds a device link to express this dependency
    for GPU and HDA devices, but it really is not specific to those device
    types.
    
    Generalize it and rename it to pci_create_device_link() so we can create
    dependencies between any "consumer" and "producer" functions of a
    multi-function device, where the consumer is only functional if the
    producer is in D0.  This reorganization should not affect any
    functionality.

      return acs_flags ? 0 : 1;
    
    Pull this out into a helper function to simplify the quirks slightly.  The

    The ACS quirks differ in needless ways, which makes them look more
    different than they really are.
    
    Reorder the ACS flags in order of definitions in the spec:
    
      PCI_ACS_SV   Source Validation
      PCI_ACS_TB   Translation Blocking
      PCI_ACS_RR   P2P Request Redirect
      PCI_ACS_CR   P2P Completion Redirect
      PCI_ACS_UF   Upstream Forwarding
      PCI_ACS_EC   P2P Egress Control
      PCI_ACS_DT   Direct Translated P2P
    
    (PCIe r5.0, sec 7.7.8.2) and use similar code structure in all.  No
    functional change intended.

    x86/amd_nb: Add PCI device IDs for family 17h, model 70h
    
    [ Upstream commit af4e1c5eca95bed1192d8dc45c8ed63aea2209e8 ]
    
    The AMD Ryzen gen 3 processors came with a different PCI IDs for the
    function 3 & 4 which are used to access the SMN interface. The root
    PCI address however remained at the same address as the model 30h.
    
    Adding the F3/F4 PCI IDs respectively to the misc and link ids appear
    to be sufficient for k10temp, so let's add them and follow up on the
    patch if other functions need more tweaking.
    
    Vicki Pfau sent an identical patch after I checked that no-one had
    written this patch. I would have been happy about dropping my patch but
    unlike for his patch series, I had already Cc:ed the x86 people and
    they already reviewed the changes. Since Vicki has not answered to
    any email after his initial series, let's assume she is on vacation
    and let's avoid duplication of reviews from the maintainers and merge
    my series. To acknowledge Vicki's anteriority, I added her S-o-b to
    the patch.
    
    v2, suggested by Guenter Roeck and Brian Woods:
     - rename from 71h to 70h

    PCI: Enable NVIDIA HDA controllers
    
    [ Upstream commit b516ea586d717472178e6ef1c152e85608b0ce32 ]
    
    Many NVIDIA GPUs can be configured as either a single-function video device
    or a multi-function device with video at function 0 and an HDA audio
    controller at function 1.  The HDA controller can be enabled or disabled by
    a bit in the function 0 config space.
    
    Some BIOSes leave the HDA disabled, which means the HDMI connector from the
    NVIDIA GPU may not work.  Sometimes the BIOS enables the HDA if an HDMI
    cable is connected at boot time, but that doesn't handle hotplug cases.
    
    Enable the HDA controller on device enumeration and resume and re-read the
    header type, which tells us whether the GPU is a multi-function device.
    
    This quirk is limited to NVIDIA PCI devices with the VGA Controller device
    class.  This is expected to correspond to product configurations where the
    NVIDIA GPU has connectors attached.  Other products where the device class
    is 3D Controller are expected to correspond to configurations where the
    NVIDIA GPU is dedicated (dGPU) and has no connectors.  See original post
    (URL below) for more details.
    
    This commit takes inspiration from an earlier patch by Daniel Drake.

    PCI: Add NVIDIA GPU multi-function power dependencies
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d2e369f0d4c3e6125c886847c04106b03d2609e ]
    
    The NVIDIA Turing GPU is a multi-function PCI device with the following
    functions:
    
      - Function 0: VGA display controller
      - Function 1: Audio controller
      - Function 2: USB xHCI Host controller
      - Function 3: USB Type-C UCSI controller
    
    Function 0 is tightly coupled with other functions in the hardware.  When
    function 0 is in D3, it gates power for hardware blocks used by other
    functions, which means those functions only work when function 0 is in D0.
    If any of these functions (1/2/3) are in D0, then function 0 should also be
    in D0.
    
    Commit 07f4f97d7b4b ("vga_switcheroo: Use device link for HDA controller")
    already creates a device link to show the dependency of function 1 on
    function 0 of this GPU.  Create additional device links to express the
    dependencies of functions 2 and 3 on function 0.  This means function 0
    will be in D0 if any other function is in D0.
    
    [bhelgaas: I think the PCI spec expectation is that functions can be
    power-managed independently, so I don't think this device is technically
    compliant.  For example, the PCIe r5.0 spec, sec 1.4, says "the PCI/PCIe
    hardware/software model includes architectural constructs necessary to
    discover, configure, and use a Function, without needing Function-specific
    knowledge" and sec 5.1 says "D states are associated with a particular
    Function" and "PM provides ... a mechanism to identify power management
    capabilities of a given Function [and] the ability to transition a Function
    into a certain power management state."]

    PCI: Add ACS quirk for Intel Root Complex Integrated Endpoints
    
    [ Upstream commit 3247bd10a4502a3075ce8e1c3c7d31ef76f193ce ]
    
    All Intel platforms guarantee that all root complex implementations must
    send transactions up to IOMMU for address translations. Hence for Intel
    RCiEP devices, we can assume some ACS-type isolation even without an ACS
    capability.
    
    From the Intel VT-d spec, r3.1, sec 3.16 ("Root-Complex Peer to Peer
    Considerations"):
    
      When DMA remapping is enabled, peer-to-peer requests through the
      Root-Complex must be handled as follows:
    
      - The input address in the request is translated (through first-level,
        second-level or nested translation) to a host physical address (HPA).
        The address decoding for peer addresses must be done only on the
        translated HPA. Hardware implementations are free to further limit
        peer-to-peer accesses to specific host physical address regions (or
        to completely disallow peer-forwarding of translated requests).
    
      - Since address translation changes the contents (address field) of
        the PCI Express Transaction Layer Packet (TLP), for PCI Express
        peer-to-peer requests with ECRC, the Root-Complex hardware must use
        the new ECRC (re-computed with the translated address) if it
        decides to forward the TLP as a peer request.
    
      - Root-ports, and multi-function root-complex integrated endpoints, may
        support additional peer-to-peer control features by supporting PCI
        Express Access Control Services (ACS) capability. Refer to ACS
        capability in PCI Express specifications for details.
    
    Since Linux didn't give special treatment to allow this exception, certain
    RCiEP MFD devices were grouped in a single IOMMU group. This doesn't permit
    a single device to be assigned to a guest for instance.
    
    In one vendor system: Device 14.x were grouped in a single IOMMU group.
    
      /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/5/devices/0000:00:14.0
      /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/5/devices/0000:00:14.2
      /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/5/devices/0000:00:14.3
    
    After this patch:
    
      /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/5/devices/0000:00:14.0
      /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/5/devices/0000:00:14.2
      /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/6/devices/0000:00:14.3 <<< new group
    
    14.0 and 14.2 are integrated devices, but legacy end points, whereas 14.3
    was a PCIe-compliant RCiEP.
    
      00:14.3 Network controller: Intel Corporation Device 9df0 (rev 30)
        Capabilities: [40] Express (v2) Root Complex Integrated Endpoint, MSI 00
    
    This permits assigning this device to a guest VM.

    PCI: Avoid FLR for AMD Starship USB 3.0
    
    [ Upstream commit 5727043c73fdfe04597971b5f3f4850d879c1f4f ]
    
    The AMD Starship USB 3.0 host controller advertises Function Level Reset
    support, but it apparently doesn't work.  Add a quirk to prevent use of FLR
    on this device.
    
    Without this quirk, when attempting to assign (pass through) an AMD
    Starship USB 3.0 host controller to a guest OS, the system becomes
    increasingly unresponsive over the course of several minutes, eventually
    requiring a hard reset.  Shortly after attempting to start the guest, I see
    these messages:

    And then eventually:

    PCI: Avoid Pericom USB controller OHCI/EHCI PME# defect
    
    [ Upstream commit 68f5fc4ea9ddf9f77720d568144219c4e6452cde ]

    But testing shows that it's unreliable: there is a 20% chance PME# won't be
    asserted when a USB device is plugged.
    
    Remove PME support for both devices to make USB plugging work reliably.

    ext4: fix race between ext4_sync_parent() and rename()
    
    commit 08adf452e628b0e2ce9a01048cfbec52353703d7 upstream.
    
    'igrab(d_inode(dentry->d_parent))' without holding dentry->d_lock is
    broken because without d_lock, d_parent can be concurrently changed due
    to a rename().  Then if the old directory is immediately deleted, old
    d_parent->inode can be NULL.  That causes a NULL dereference in igrab().
    
    To fix this, use dget_parent() to safely grab a reference to the parent
    dentry, which pins the inode.  This also eliminates the need to use
    d_find_any_alias() other than for the initial inode, as we no longer
    throw away the dentry at each step.
    
    This is an extremely hard race to hit, but it is possible.  Adding a
    udelay() in between the reads of ->d_parent and its ->d_inode makes it
    reproducible on a no-journal filesystem using the following program:
    
        #include <fcntl.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
    
        int main()
        {
            if (fork()) {
                for (;;) {
                    mkdir("dir1", 0700);
                    int fd = open("dir1/file", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_SYNC);
                    write(fd, "X", 1);
                    close(fd);
                }
            } else {
                mkdir("dir2", 0700);
                for (;;) {
                    rename("dir1/file", "dir2/file");
                    rmdir("dir1");
                }

    ext4: fix error pointer dereference
    
    commit 8418897f1bf87da0cb6936489d57a4320c32c0af upstream.
    
    Don't pass error pointers to brelse().
    
    commit 7159a986b420 ("ext4: fix some error pointer dereferences") has fixed
    some cases, fix the remaining one case.
    
    Once ext4_xattr_block_find()->ext4_sb_bread() failed, error pointer is
    stored in @bs->bh, which will be passed to brelse() in the cleanup
    routine of ext4_xattr_set_handle(). This will then cause a NULL panic
    crash in __brelse().

    If eh->eh_max is 0, EXT_MAX_EXTENT/INDEX would evaluate to unsigned
    (-1) resulting in illegal memory accesses. Although there is no
    consistent repro, we see that generic/019 sometimes crashes because of

    ima: Fix ima digest hash table key calculation
    
    commit 1129d31b55d509f15e72dc68e4b5c3a4d7b4da8d upstream.
    
    Function hash_long() accepts unsigned long, while currently only one byte
    is passed from ima_hash_key(), which calculates a key for ima_htable.
    
    Given that hashing the digest does not give clear benefits compared to
    using the digest itself, remove hash_long() and return the modulus
    calculated on the first two bytes of the digest with the number of slots.
    Also reduce the depth of the hash table by doubling the number of slots.

    mm: initialize deferred pages with interrupts enabled
    
    commit 3d060856adfc59afb9d029c233141334cfaba418 upstream.
    
    Initializing struct pages is a long task and keeping interrupts disabled
    for the duration of this operation introduces a number of problems.
    
    1. jiffies are not updated for long period of time, and thus incorrect time
       is reported. See proposed solution and discussion here:
       lkml/20200311123848.118638-1-shile.zhang@linux.alibaba.com
    2. It prevents farther improving deferred page initialization by allowing
       intra-node multi-threading.
    
    We are keeping interrupts disabled to solve a rather theoretical problem
    that was never observed in real world (See 3a2d7fa8a3d5).
    
    Let's keep interrupts enabled. In case we ever encounter a scenario where
    an interrupt thread wants to allocate large amount of memory this early in
    boot we can deal with that by growing zone (see deferred_grow_zone()) by
    the needed amount before starting deferred_init_memmap() threads.
    
    Before:
    [    1.232459] node 0 initialised, 12058412 pages in 1ms
    
    After:
    [    1.632580] node 0 initialised, 12051227 pages in 436ms

    mm: thp: make the THP mapcount atomic against __split_huge_pmd_locked()
    
    commit c444eb564fb16645c172d550359cb3d75fe8a040 upstream.
    
    Write protect anon page faults require an accurate mapcount to decide
    if to break the COW or not. This is implemented in the THP path with
    reuse_swap_page() ->
    page_trans_huge_map_swapcount()/page_trans_huge_mapcount().
    
    If the COW triggers while the other processes sharing the page are
    under a huge pmd split, to do an accurate reading, we must ensure the
    mapcount isn't computed while it's being transferred from the head
    page to the tail pages.
    
    reuse_swap_cache() already runs serialized by the page lock, so it's
    enough to add the page lock around __split_huge_pmd_locked too, in
    order to add the missing serialization.
    
    Note: the commit in "Fixes" is just to facilitate the backporting,
    because the code before such commit didn't try to do an accurate THP
    mapcount calculation and it instead used the page_count() to decide if
    to COW or not. Both the page_count and the pin_count are THP-wide
    refcounts, so they're inaccurate if used in
    reuse_swap_page(). Reverting such commit (besides the unrelated fix to
    the local anon_vma assignment) would have also opened the window for
    memory corruption side effects to certain workloads as documented in
    such commit header.

    btrfs: send: emit file capabilities after chown
    
    commit 89efda52e6b6930f80f5adda9c3c9edfb1397191 upstream.
    
    Whenever a chown is executed, all capabilities of the file being touched
    are lost.  When doing incremental send with a file with capabilities,
    there is a situation where the capability can be lost on the receiving
    side. The sequence of actions bellow shows the problem:
    
      $ mount /dev/sda fs1
      $ mount /dev/sdb fs2
    
      $ touch fs1/foo.bar
      $ setcap cap_sys_nice+ep fs1/foo.bar
      $ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r fs1 fs1/snap_init
      $ btrfs send fs1/snap_init | btrfs receive fs2
    
      $ chgrp adm fs1/foo.bar
      $ setcap cap_sys_nice+ep fs1/foo.bar
    
      $ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r fs1 fs1/snap_complete
      $ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r fs1 fs1/snap_incremental
    
      $ btrfs send fs1/snap_complete | btrfs receive fs2
      $ btrfs send -p fs1/snap_init fs1/snap_incremental | btrfs receive fs2
    
    At this point, only a chown was emitted by "btrfs send" since only the
    group was changed. This makes the cap_sys_nice capability to be dropped
    from fs2/snap_incremental/foo.bar
    
    To fix that, only emit capabilities after chown is emitted. The current
    code first checks for xattrs that are new/changed, emits them, and later
    emit the chown. Now, __process_new_xattr skips capabilities, letting
    only finish_inode_if_needed to emit them, if they exist, for the inode
    being processed.
    
    This behavior was being worked around in "btrfs receive" side by caching
    the capability and only applying it after chown. Now, xattrs are only
    emmited _after_ chown, making that workaround not needed anymore.

    btrfs: include non-missing as a qualifier for the latest_bdev
    
    commit 998a0671961f66e9fad4990ed75f80ba3088c2f1 upstream.
    
    btrfs_free_extra_devids() updates fs_devices::latest_bdev to point to
    the bdev with greatest device::generation number.  For a typical-missing
    device the generation number is zero so fs_devices::latest_bdev will
    never point to it.
    
    But if the missing device is due to alienation [1], then
    device::generation is not zero and if it is greater or equal to the rest
    of device  generations in the list, then fs_devices::latest_bdev ends up
    pointing to the missing device and reports the error like [2].
    
    [1] We maintain devices of a fsid (as in fs_device::fsid) in the
    fs_devices::devices list, a device is considered as an alien device
    if its fsid does not match with the fs_device::fsid
    
    Consider a working filesystem with raid1:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -f -d raid1 -m raid1 /dev/sda /dev/sdb
      $ mount /dev/sda /mnt-raid1
      $ umount /mnt-raid1
    
    While mnt-raid1 was unmounted the user force-adds one of its devices to
    another btrfs filesystem:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc
      $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt-single
      $ btrfs dev add -f /dev/sda /mnt-single
    
    Now the original mnt-raid1 fails to mount in degraded mode, because
    fs_devices::latest_bdev is pointing to the alien device.
    
      $ mount -o degraded /dev/sdb /mnt-raid1
    
    [2]
    mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb,
           missing codepage or helper program, or other error
    
           In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
           dmesg | tail or so.
    
      kernel: BTRFS warning (device sdb): devid 1 uuid 072a0192-675b-4d5a-8640-a5cf2b2c704d is missing
      kernel: BTRFS error (device sdb): failed to read devices
      kernel: BTRFS error (device sdb): open_ctree failed
    
    Fix the root cause by checking if the device is not missing before it
    can be considered for the fs_devices::latest_bdev.

    string.h: fix incompatibility between FORTIFY_SOURCE and KASAN
    
    [ Upstream commit 47227d27e2fcb01a9e8f5958d8997cf47a820afc ]
    
    The memcmp KASAN self-test fails on a kernel with both KASAN and
    FORTIFY_SOURCE.
    
    When FORTIFY_SOURCE is on, a number of functions are replaced with
    fortified versions, which attempt to check the sizes of the operands.
    However, these functions often directly invoke __builtin_foo() once they
    have performed the fortify check.  Using __builtins may bypass KASAN
    checks if the compiler decides to inline it's own implementation as
    sequence of instructions, rather than emit a function call that goes out
    to a KASAN-instrumented implementation.
    
    Why is only memcmp affected?
    ============================
    
    Of the string and string-like functions that kasan_test tests, only memcmp
    is replaced by an inline sequence of instructions in my testing on x86
    with gcc version 9.2.1 20191008 (Ubuntu 9.2.1-9ubuntu2).
    
    I believe this is due to compiler heuristics.  For example, if I annotate
    kmalloc calls with the alloc_size annotation (and disable some fortify
    compile-time checking!), the compiler will replace every memset except the
    one in kmalloc_uaf_memset with inline instructions.  (I have some WIP
    patches to add this annotation.)
    
    Does this affect other functions in string.h?
    =============================================
    
    Yes. Anything that uses __builtin_* rather than __real_* could be
    affected. This looks like:
    
     - strncpy
     - strcat
     - strlen
     - strlcpy maybe, under some circumstances?
     - strncat under some circumstances
     - memset
     - memcpy
     - memmove
     - memcmp (as noted)
     - memchr
     - strcpy
    
    Whether a function call is emitted always depends on the compiler.  Most
    bugs should get caught by FORTIFY_SOURCE, but the missed memcmp test shows
    that this is not always the case.
    
    Isn't FORTIFY_SOURCE disabled with KASAN?
    ========================================-
    
    The string headers on all arches supporting KASAN disable fortify with
    kasan, but only when address sanitisation is _also_ disabled.  For example
    from x86:
    
     #if defined(CONFIG_KASAN) && !defined(__SANITIZE_ADDRESS__)
     /*
      * For files that are not instrumented (e.g. mm/slub.c) we
      * should use not instrumented version of mem* functions.
      */
     #define memcpy(dst, src, len) __memcpy(dst, src, len)
     #define memmove(dst, src, len) __memmove(dst, src, len)
     #define memset(s, c, n) __memset(s, c, n)
    
     #ifndef __NO_FORTIFY
     #define __NO_FORTIFY /* FORTIFY_SOURCE uses __builtin_memcpy, etc. */
     #endif
    
     #endif
    
    This comes from commit 6974f0c4555e ("include/linux/string.h: add the
    option of fortified string.h functions"), and doesn't work when KASAN is
    enabled and the file is supposed to be sanitised - as with test_kasan.c
    
    I'm pretty sure this is not wrong, but not as expansive it should be:
    
     * we shouldn't use __builtin_memcpy etc in files where we don't have
       instrumentation - it could devolve into a function call to memcpy,
       which will be instrumented. Rather, we should use __memcpy which
       by convention is not instrumented.
    
     * we also shouldn't be using __builtin_memcpy when we have a KASAN
       instrumented file, because it could be replaced with inline asm
       that will not be instrumented.
    
    What is correct behaviour?
    ==========================
    
    Firstly, there is some overlap between fortification and KASAN: both
    provide some level of _runtime_ checking. Only fortify provides
    compile-time checking.
    
    KASAN and fortify can pick up different things at runtime:
    
     - Some fortify functions, notably the string functions, could easily be
       modified to consider sub-object sizes (e.g. members within a struct),
       and I have some WIP patches to do this. KASAN cannot detect these
       because it cannot insert poision between members of a struct.
    
     - KASAN can detect many over-reads/over-writes when the sizes of both
       operands are unknown, which fortify cannot.
    
    So there are a couple of options:
    
     1) Flip the test: disable fortify in santised files and enable it in
        unsanitised files. This at least stops us missing KASAN checking, but
        we lose the fortify checking.
    
     2) Make the fortify code always call out to real versions. Do this only
        for KASAN, for fear of losing the inlining opportunities we get from
        __builtin_*.
    
    (We can't use kasan_check_{read,write}: because the fortify functions are
    _extern inline_, you can't include _static_ inline functions without a
    compiler warning. kasan_check_{read,write} are static inline so we can't
    use them even when they would otherwise be suitable.)
    
    Take approach 2 and call out to real versions when KASAN is enabled.
    
    Use __underlying_foo to distinguish from __real_foo: __real_foo always
    refers to the kernel's implementation of foo, __underlying_foo could be
    either the kernel implementation or the __builtin_foo implementation.
    
    This is sometimes enough to make the memcmp test succeed with
    FORTIFY_SOURCE enabled. It is at least enough to get the function call
    into the module. One more fix is needed to make it reliable: see the next
    patch.

    platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only blacklist SW_TABLET_MODE on the 9 / "Laptop" chasis-type
    
    [ Upstream commit cfae58ed681c5fe0185db843013ecc71cd265ebf ]
    
    The HP Stream x360 11-p000nd no longer report SW_TABLET_MODE state / events
    with recent kernels. This model reports a chassis-type of 10 / "Notebook"
    which is not on the recently introduced chassis-type whitelist
    
    Commit de9647efeaa9 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only activate tablet mode
    switch on 2-in-1's") added a chassis-type whitelist and only listed 31 /
    "Convertible" as being capable of generating valid SW_TABLET_MOD events.
    
    Commit 1fac39fd0316 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Also handle tablet-mode
    switch on "Detachable" and "Portable" chassis-types") extended the
    whitelist with chassis-types 8 / "Portable" and 32 / "Detachable".
    
    And now we need to exten the whitelist again with 10 / "Notebook"...
    
    The issue original fixed by the whitelist is really a ACPI DSDT bug on
    the Dell XPS 9360 where it has a VGBS which reports it is in tablet mode
    even though it is not a 2-in-1 at all, but a regular laptop.
    
    So since this is a workaround for a DSDT issue on that specific model,
    instead of extending the whitelist over and over again, lets switch to
    a blacklist and only blacklist the chassis-type of the model for which
    the chassis-type check was added.
    
    Note this also fixes the current version of the code no longer checking
    if dmi_get_system_info(DMI_CHASSIS_TYPE) returns NULL.

    [ Upstream commit 5cdc45ed3948042f0d73c6fec5ee9b59e637d0d2 ]
    
    First of all, unsigned long can overflow u32 value on 64-bit machine.
    Second, simple_strtoul() doesn't check for overflow in the input.
    
    Convert simple_strtoul() to kstrtou32() to eliminate above issues.

    If this function returns an error, kobject_put() must be called to

    spi: dw: Return any value retrieved from the dma_transfer callback
    
    [ Upstream commit f0410bbf7d0fb80149e3b17d11d31f5b5197873e ]
    
    DW APB SSI DMA-part of the driver may need to perform the requested
    SPI-transfer synchronously. In that case the dma_transfer() callback
    will return 0 as a marker of the SPI transfer being finished so the
    SPI core doesn't need to wait and may proceed with the SPI message
    trasnfers pumping procedure. This will be needed to fix the problem
    when DMA transactions are finished, but there is still data left in
    the SPI Tx/Rx FIFOs being sent/received. But for now make dma_transfer
    to return 1 as the normal dw_spi_transfer_one() method.

    mmc: via-sdmmc: Respect the cmd->busy_timeout from the mmc core
    
    [ Upstream commit 966244ccd2919e28f25555a77f204cd1c109cad8 ]
    
    Using a fixed 1s timeout for all commands (and data transfers) is a bit
    problematic.
    
    For some commands it means waiting longer than needed for the timer to
    expire, which may not a big issue, but still. For other commands, like for
    an erase (CMD38) that uses a R1B response, may require longer timeouts than
    1s. In these cases, we may end up treating the command as it failed, while
    it just needed some more time to complete successfully.
    
    Fix the problem by respecting the cmd->busy_timeout, which is provided by
    the mmc core.

    bcache: fix refcount underflow in bcache_device_free()
    
    [ Upstream commit 86da9f736740eba602389908574dfbb0f517baa5 ]
    
    The problematic code piece in bcache_device_free() is,
    
     785 static void bcache_device_free(struct bcache_device *d)
     786 {
     787     struct gendisk *disk = d->disk;
     [snipped]
     799     if (disk) {
     800             if (disk->flags & GENHD_FL_UP)
     801                     del_gendisk(disk);
     802
     803             if (disk->queue)
     804                     blk_cleanup_queue(disk->queue);
     805
     806             ida_simple_remove(&bcache_device_idx,
     807                               first_minor_to_idx(disk->first_minor));
     808             put_disk(disk);
     809         }
     [snipped]
     816 }
    
    At line 808, put_disk(disk) may encounter kobject refcount of 'disk'
    being underflow.
    
    Here is how to reproduce the issue,
    - Attche the backing device to a cache device and do random write to
      make the cache being dirty.
    - Stop the bcache device while the cache device has dirty data of the
      backing device.
    - Only register the backing device back, NOT register cache device.
    - The bcache device node /dev/bcache0 won't show up, because backing
      device waits for the cache device shows up for the missing dirty
      data.
    - Now echo 1 into /sys/fs/bcache/pendings_cleanup, to stop the pending
      backing device.
    - After the pending backing device stopped, use 'dmesg' to check kernel
      message, a use-after-free warning from KASA reported the refcount of
      kobject linked to the 'disk' is underflow.
    
    The dropping refcount at line 808 in the above code piece is added by
    add_disk(d->disk) in bch_cached_dev_run(). But in the above condition
    the cache device is not registered, bch_cached_dev_run() has no chance
    to be called and the refcount is not added. The put_disk() for a non-
    added refcount of gendisk kobject triggers a underflow warning.
    
    This patch checks whether GENHD_FL_UP is set in disk->flags, if it is
    not set then the bcache device was not added, don't call put_disk()
    and the the underflow issue can be avoided.

    btrfs: qgroup: mark qgroup inconsistent if we're inherting snapshot to a new qgroup
    
    [ Upstream commit cbab8ade585a18c4334b085564d9d046e01a3f70 ]
    
    [BUG]
    For the following operation, qgroup is guaranteed to be screwed up due
    to snapshot adding to a new qgroup:
    
      # mkfs.btrfs -f $dev
      # mount $dev $mnt
      # btrfs qgroup en $mnt
      # btrfs subv create $mnt/src
      # xfs_io -f -c "pwrite 0 1m" $mnt/src/file
      # sync
      # btrfs qgroup create 1/0 $mnt/src
      # btrfs subv snapshot -i 1/0 $mnt/src $mnt/snapshot
      # btrfs qgroup show -prce $mnt/src
      qgroupid         rfer         excl     max_rfer     max_excl parent  child

                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
    [CAUSE]
    The problem is in btrfs_qgroup_inherit(), we don't have good enough
    check to determine if the new relation would break the existing
    accounting.
    
    Unlike btrfs_add_qgroup_relation(), which has proper check to determine
    if we can do quick update without a rescan, in btrfs_qgroup_inherit() we
    can even assign a snapshot to multiple qgroups.
    
    [FIX]
    Fix it by manually marking qgroup inconsistent for snapshot inheritance.
    
    For subvolume creation, since all its extents are exclusively owned, we
    don't need to rescan.
    
    In theory, we should call relation check like quick_update_accounting()
    when doing qgroup inheritance and inform user about qgroup accounting
    inconsistency.
    
    But we don't have good mechanism to relay that back to the user in the
    snapshot creation context, thus we can only silently mark the qgroup
    inconsistent.
    
    Anyway, user shouldn't use qgroup inheritance during snapshot creation,
    and should add qgroup relationship after snapshot creation by 'btrfs
    qgroup assign', which has a much better UI to inform user about qgroup
    inconsistent and kick in rescan automatically.

    mips: Add udelay lpj numbers adjustment
    
    [ Upstream commit ed26aacfb5f71eecb20a51c4467da440cb719d66 ]
    
    Loops-per-jiffies is a special number which represents a number of
    noop-loop cycles per CPU-scheduler quantum - jiffies. As you
    understand aside from CPU-specific implementation it depends on
    the CPU frequency. So when a platform has the CPU frequency fixed,
    we have no problem and the current udelay interface will work
    just fine. But as soon as CPU-freq driver is enabled and the cores
    frequency changes, we'll end up with distorted udelay's. In order
    to fix this we have to accordinly adjust the per-CPU udelay_val
    (the same as the global loops_per_jiffy) number. This can be done
    in the CPU-freq transition event handler. We subscribe to that event
    in the MIPS arch time-inititalization method.

    mips: MAAR: Use more precise address mask
    
    [ Upstream commit bbb5946eb545fab8ad8f46bce8a803e1c0c39d47 ]
    
    Indeed according to the MIPS32 Privileged Resource Architecgture the MAAR
    pair register address field either takes [12:31] bits for non-XPA systems
    and [12:55] otherwise. In any case the current address mask is just
    wrong for 64-bit and 32-bits XPA chips. So lets extend it to 59-bits
    of physical address value. This shall cover the 64-bits architecture and
    systems with XPA enabled, and won't cause any problem for non-XPA 32-bit
    systems, since address values exceeding the architecture specific MAAR
    mask will be just truncated with setting zeros in the unsupported upper
    bits.

    x86/boot: Correct relocation destination on old linkers
    
    [ Upstream commit 5214028dd89e49ba27007c3ee475279e584261f0 ]
    
    For the 32-bit kernel, as described in
    
      6d92bc9d483a ("x86/build: Build compressed x86 kernels as PIE"),
    
    pre-2.26 binutils generates R_386_32 relocations in PIE mode. Since the
    startup code does not perform relocation, any reloc entry with R_386_32
    will remain as 0 in the executing code.
    
    Commit
    
      974f221c84b0 ("x86/boot: Move compressed kernel to the end of the
                     decompression buffer")
    
    added a new symbol _end but did not mark it hidden, which doesn't give
    the correct offset on older linkers. This causes the compressed kernel
    to be copied beyond the end of the decompression buffer, rather than
    flush against it. This region of memory may be reserved or already
    allocated for other purposes by the bootloader.
    
    Mark _end as hidden to fix. This changes the relocation from R_386_32 to
    R_386_RELATIVE even on the pre-2.26 binutils.
    
    For 64-bit, this is not strictly necessary, as the 64-bit kernel is only
    built as PIE if the linker supports -z noreloc-overflow, which implies
    binutils-2.27+, but for consistency, mark _end as hidden here too.
    
    The below illustrates the before/after impact of the patch using
    binutils-2.25 and gcc-4.6.4 (locally compiled from source) and QEMU.

    mwifiex: Fix memory corruption in dump_station
    
    [ Upstream commit 3aa42bae9c4d1641aeb36f1a8585cd1d506cf471 ]
    
    The mwifiex_cfg80211_dump_station() uses static variable for iterating
    over a linked list of all associated stations (when the driver is in UAP
    role). This has a race condition if .dump_station is called in parallel
    for multiple interfaces. This corruption can be triggered by registering
    multiple SSIDs and calling, in parallel for multiple interfaces
        iw dev <iface> station dump

    This patch drops the use of the static iterator, and instead every time
    the function is called iterates to the idx-th position of the
    linked-list.
    
    It would be better to convert the code not to use linked list for
    associated stations storage (since the chip has a limited number of
    associated stations anyway - it could just be an array). Such a change
    may be proposed in the future. In the meantime this patch can backported
    into stable kernels in this simple form.

    rtlwifi: Fix a double free in _rtl_usb_tx_urb_setup()
    
    [ Upstream commit beb12813bc75d4a23de43b85ad1c7cb28d27631e ]
    
    Seven years ago we tried to fix a leak but actually introduced a double
    free instead.  It was an understandable mistake because the code was a
    bit confusing and the free was done in the wrong place.  The "skb"
    pointer is freed in both _rtl_usb_tx_urb_setup() and _rtl_usb_transmit().
    The free belongs _rtl_usb_transmit() instead of _rtl_usb_tx_urb_setup()
    and I've cleaned the code up a bit to hopefully make it more clear.

    veth: Adjust hard_start offset on redirect XDP frames
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c8572251fabc5bb49fd623c064e95a9daf6a3e3 ]
    
    When native XDP redirect into a veth device, the frame arrives in the
    xdp_frame structure. It is then processed in veth_xdp_rcv_one(),
    which can run a new XDP bpf_prog on the packet. Doing so requires
    converting xdp_frame to xdp_buff, but the tricky part is that
    xdp_frame memory area is located in the top (data_hard_start) memory
    area that xdp_buff will point into.
    
    The current code tried to protect the xdp_frame area, by assigning
    xdp_buff.data_hard_start past this memory. This results in 32 bytes
    less headroom to expand into via BPF-helper bpf_xdp_adjust_head().
    
    This protect step is actually not needed, because BPF-helper
    bpf_xdp_adjust_head() already reserve this area, and don't allow
    BPF-prog to expand into it. Thus, it is safe to point data_hard_start
    directly at xdp_frame memory area.

    md: don't flush workqueue unconditionally in md_open
    
    [ Upstream commit f6766ff6afff70e2aaf39e1511e16d471de7c3ae ]
    
    We need to check mddev->del_work before flush workqueu since the purpose
    of flush is to ensure the previous md is disappeared. Otherwise the similar
    deadlock appeared if LOCKDEP is enabled, it is due to md_open holds the
    bdev->bd_mutex before flush workqueue.

    And md_alloc also flushed the same workqueue, but the thing is different
    here. Because all the paths call md_alloc don't hold bdev->bd_mutex, and
    the flush is necessary to avoid race condition, so leave it as it is.

    net: qed*: Reduce RX and TX default ring count when running inside kdump kernel
    
    [ Upstream commit 73e030977f7884dbe1be0018bab517e8d02760f8 ]
    
    Normally kdump kernel(s) run under severe memory constraint with the
    basic idea being to save the crashdump vmcore reliably when the primary
    kernel panics/hangs.
    
    Currently the qed* ethernet driver ends up consuming a lot of memory in
    the kdump kernel, leading to kdump kernel panic when one tries to save
    the vmcore via ssh/nfs (thus utilizing the services of the underlying
    qed* network interfaces).
    
    An example OOM message log seen in the kdump kernel can be seen here
    [1], with crashkernel size reservation of 512M.
    
    Using tools like memstrack (see [2]), we can track the modules taking up
    the bulk of memory in the kdump kernel and organize the memory usage
    output as per 'highest allocator first'. An example log for the OOM case
    indicates that the qed* modules end up allocating approximately 216M
    memory, which is a large part of the total crashkernel size:
    
     dracut-pre-pivot[676]: ======== Report format module_summary: ========
     dracut-pre-pivot[676]: Module qed using 149.6MB (2394 pages), peak allocation 149.6MB (2394 pages)
     dracut-pre-pivot[676]: Module qede using 65.3MB (1045 pages), peak allocation 65.3MB (1045 pages)
    
    This patch reduces the default RX and TX ring count from 1024 to 64
    when running inside kdump kernel, which leads to a significant memory
    saving.
    
    An example log with the patch applied shows the reduced memory
    allocation in the kdump kernel:
     dracut-pre-pivot[674]: ======== Report format module_summary: ========
     dracut-pre-pivot[674]: Module qed using 141.8MB (2268 pages), peak allocation 141.8MB (2268 pages)
     <..snip..>
    [dracut-pre-pivot[674]: Module qede using 4.8MB (76 pages), peak allocation 4.9MB (78 pages)
    
    Tested crashdump vmcore save via ssh/nfs protocol using underlying qed*
    network interface after applying this patch.

    ath10k: Remove msdu from idr when management pkt send fails
    
    [ Upstream commit c730c477176ad4af86d9aae4d360a7ad840b073a ]
    
    Currently when the sending of any management pkt
    via wmi command fails, the packet is being unmapped
    freed in the error handling. But the idr entry added,
    which is used to track these packet is not getting removed.
    
    Hence, during unload, in wmi cleanup, all the entries
    in IDR are removed and the corresponding buffer is
    attempted to be freed. This can cause a situation where
    one packet is attempted to be freed twice.
    
    Fix this error by rmeoving the msdu from the idr
    list when the sending of a management packet over
    wmi fails.

    platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Also handle tablet-mode switch on "Detachable" and "Portable" chassis-types
    
    [ Upstream commit 1fac39fd0316b19c3e57a182524332332d1643ce ]
    
    Commit de9647efeaa9 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only activate tablet mode
    switch on 2-in-1's") added a DMI chassis-type check to avoid accidentally
    reporting SW_TABLET_MODE = 1 to userspace on laptops.
    
    Some devices with a detachable keyboard and using the intel-vbnt (INT33D6)
    interface to report if they are in tablet mode (keyboard detached) or not,
    report 32 / "Detachable" as chassis-type, e.g. the HP Pavilion X2 series.
    
    Other devices with a detachable keyboard and using the intel-vbnt (INT33D6)
    interface to report SW_TABLET_MODE, report 8 / "Portable" as chassis-type.
    The Dell Venue 11 Pro 7130 is an example of this.
    
    Extend the DMI chassis-type check to also accept Portables and Detachables
    so that the intel-vbtn driver will report SW_TABLET_MODE on these devices.
    
    Note the chassis-type check was originally added to avoid a false-positive
    tablet-mode report on the Dell XPS 9360 laptop. To the best of my knowledge
    that laptop is using a chassis-type of 9 / "Laptop", so after this commit
    we still ignore the tablet-switch for that chassis-type.

    platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Do not advertise switches to userspace if they are not there
    
    [ Upstream commit 990fbb48067bf8cfa34b7d1e6e1674eaaef2f450 ]
    
    Commit de9647efeaa9 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only activate tablet mode

    reporting SW_TABLET_MODE = 1 to userspace on laptops (specifically on the
    Dell XPS 9360), to avoid e.g. userspace ignoring touchpad events because
    userspace thought the device was in tablet-mode.
    
    But if we are not getting the initial status of the switch because the
    device does not have a tablet mode, then we really should not advertise
    the presence of a tablet-mode switch to userspace at all, as userspace may
    use the mere presence of this switch for certain heuristics.

    xfs: reset buffer write failure state on successful completion
    
    [ Upstream commit b6983e80b03bd4fd42de71993b3ac7403edac758 ]
    
    The buffer write failure flag is intended to control the internal
    write retry that XFS has historically implemented to help mitigate
    the severity of transient I/O errors. The flag is set when a buffer
    is resubmitted from the I/O completion path due to a previous
    failure. It is checked on subsequent I/O completions to skip the
    internal retry and fall through to the higher level configurable
    error handling mechanism. The flag is cleared in the synchronous and
    delwri submission paths and also checked in various places to log
    write failure messages.
    
    There are a couple minor problems with the current usage of this
    flag. One is that we issue an internal retry after every submission
    from xfsaild due to how delwri submission clears the flag. This
    results in double the expected or configured number of write
    attempts when under sustained failures. Another more subtle issue is
    that the flag is never cleared on successful I/O completion. This
    can cause xfs_wait_buftarg() to suggest that dirty buffers are being
    thrown away due to the existence of the flag, when the reality is
    that the flag might still be set because the write succeeded on the
    retry.
    
    Clear the write failure flag on successful I/O completion to address
    both of these problems. This means that the internal retry attempt
    occurs once since the last time a buffer write failed and that
    various other contexts only see the flag set when the immediately
    previous write attempt has failed.

    kgdb: Fix spurious true from in_dbg_master()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3fec4aecb311995189217e64d725cfe84a568de3 ]
    
    Currently there is a small window where a badly timed migration could
    cause in_dbg_master() to spuriously return true. Specifically if we
    migrate to a new core after reading the processor id and the previous
    core takes a breakpoint then we will evaluate true if we read
    kgdb_active before we get the IPI to bring us to halt.
    
    Fix this by checking irqs_disabled() first. Interrupts are always
    disabled when we are executing the kgdb trap so this is an acceptable
    prerequisite. This also allows us to replace raw_smp_processor_id()
    with smp_processor_id() since the short circuit logic will prevent
    warnings from PREEMPT_DEBUG.

    powerpc/spufs: fix copy_to_user while atomic
    
    [ Upstream commit 88413a6bfbbe2f648df399b62f85c934460b7a4d ]
    
    Currently, we may perform a copy_to_user (through
    simple_read_from_buffer()) while holding a context's register_lock,
    while accessing the context save area.
    
    This change uses a temporary buffer for the context save area data,
    which we then pass to simple_read_from_buffer.

    The log_addrs->log_addr_type[i] value is a u8 which is controlled by
    the user and comes from the ioctl.  If it's over 31 then that results in
    undefined behavior (shift wrapping) and that leads to a Smatch static
    checker warning.  We already cap the value later so we can silence the
    warning just by re-ordering the existing checks.
    
    I think the UBSan checker will also catch this bug at runtime and
    generate a warning.  But otherwise the bug is harmless.

    sched/core: Fix illegal RCU from offline CPUs
    
    [ Upstream commit bf2c59fce4074e55d622089b34be3a6bc95484fb ]
    
    In the CPU-offline process, it calls mmdrop() after idle entry and the
    subsequent call to cpuhp_report_idle_dead(). Once execution passes the
    call to rcu_report_dead(), RCU is ignoring the CPU, which results in
    lockdep complaining when mmdrop() uses RCU from either memcg or
    debugobjects below.
    
    Fix it by cleaning up the active_mm state from BP instead. Every arch
    which has CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU should have already called idle_task_exit()
    from AP. The only exception is parisc because it switches them to
    &init_mm unconditionally (see smp_boot_one_cpu() and smp_cpu_init()),
    but the patch will still work there because it calls mmgrab(&init_mm) in
    smp_cpu_init() and then should call mmdrop(&init_mm) in finish_cpu().
    
      WARNING: suspicious RCU usage
      -----------------------------
      kernel/workqueue.c:710 RCU or wq_pool_mutex should be held!

    exit: Move preemption fixup up, move blocking operations down
    
    [ Upstream commit 586b58cac8b4683eb58a1446fbc399de18974e40 ]
    
    With CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP=y and CONFIG_CGROUPS=y, kernel oopses in
    non-preemptible context look untidy; after the main oops, the kernel prints
    a "sleeping function called from invalid context" report because
    exit_signals() -> cgroup_threadgroup_change_begin() -> percpu_down_read()
    can sleep, and that happens before the preempt_count_set(PREEMPT_ENABLED)
    fixup.
    
    It looks like the same thing applies to profile_task_exit() and
    kcov_task_exit().
    
    Fix it by moving the preemption fixup up and the calls to
    profile_task_exit() and kcov_task_exit() down.

    2 errors generated.
    
    This special case for umul_ppmm for MIPS64r6 was added in
    commit bbc25bee37d2b ("lib/mpi: Fix umul_ppmm() for MIPS64r6"), due to
    GCC being inefficient and emitting a __multi3 intrinsic.
    
    There is no such issue with clang; with this patch applied, I can build
    this configuration without any problems and there are no link errors
    like mentioned in the commit above (which I can still reproduce with
    GCC 9.3.0 when that commit is reverted). Only use this definition when
    GCC is being used.
    
    This really should have been caught by commit b0c091ae04f67 ("lib/mpi:
    Eliminate unused umul_ppmm definitions for MIPS") when I was messing
    around in this area but I was not testing 64-bit MIPS at the time.

    This change ensures that address filtering or promiscuous mode are
    properly restored by the driver after the MAC may have been reset.

    Bluetooth: btbcm: Add 2 missing models to subver tables
    
    [ Upstream commit c03ee9af4e07112bd3fc688daca9e654f41eca93 ]
    
    Currently the bcm_uart_subver_ and bcm_usb_subver_table-s lack entries
    for the BCM4324B5 and BCM20703A1 chipsets. This makes the code use just
    "BCM" as prefix for the filename to pass to request-firmware, making it
    harder for users to figure out which firmware they need. This especially
    is problematic with the UART attached BCM4324B5 where this leads to the
    filename being just "BCM.hcd".
    
    Add the 2 missing devices to subver tables. This has been tested on:
    
    1. A Dell XPS15 9550 where this makes btbcm.c try to load
    "BCM20703A1-0a5c-6410.hcd" before it tries to load "BCM-0a5c-6410.hcd".
    
    2. A Thinkpad 8 where this makes btbcm.c try to load

    MIPS: Make sparse_init() using top-down allocation
    
    [ Upstream commit 269b3a9ac538c4ae87f84be640b9fa89914a2489 ]
    
    In the current code, if CONFIG_SWIOTLB is set, when failed to get IO TLB
    memory from the low pages by plat_swiotlb_setup(), it may lead to the boot
    process failed with kernel panic.
    
    (1) On the Loongson and SiByte platform
    arch/mips/loongson64/dma.c
    arch/mips/sibyte/common/dma.c
    void __init plat_swiotlb_setup(void)
    {
            swiotlb_init(1);
    }
    
    kernel/dma/swiotlb.c
    void  __init
    swiotlb_init(int verbose)
    {
    ...
            vstart = memblock_alloc_low(PAGE_ALIGN(bytes), PAGE_SIZE);
            if (vstart && !swiotlb_init_with_tbl(vstart, io_tlb_nslabs, verbose))
                    return;
    ...
            pr_warn("Cannot allocate buffer");
            no_iotlb_memory = true;
    }
    
    phys_addr_t swiotlb_tbl_map_single()
    {
    ...
            if (no_iotlb_memory)
                    panic("Can not allocate SWIOTLB buffer earlier ...");
    ...
    }
    
    (2) On the Cavium OCTEON platform
    arch/mips/cavium-octeon/dma-octeon.c
    void __init plat_swiotlb_setup(void)
    {
    ...
            octeon_swiotlb = memblock_alloc_low(swiotlbsize, PAGE_SIZE);
            if (!octeon_swiotlb)
                    panic("%s: Failed to allocate %zu bytes align=%lx\n",
                          __func__, swiotlbsize, PAGE_SIZE);
    ...
    }
    
    Because IO_TLB_DEFAULT_SIZE is 64M, if the rest size of low memory is less
    than 64M when call plat_swiotlb_setup(), we can easily reproduce the panic
    case.
    
    In order to reduce the possibility of kernel panic when failed to get IO
    TLB memory under CONFIG_SWIOTLB, it is better to allocate low memory as
    small as possible before plat_swiotlb_setup(), so make sparse_init() using
    top-down allocation.

    segment size reported by the DMA core (64K). With the DMA debug enabled,
    this produces a warning such as the following:
    
    "DMA-API: rcar-fcp fea27000.fcp: mapping sg segment longer than device
    claims to support [len=3145728] [max=65536]"
    
    We have no specific limitation on the segment size which isn't already
    handled by the VSP1/DU which actually handles the DMA allcoations and
    buffer management, so define a maximum segment size of up to 4GB (a 32
    bit mask).

    Currently when i2c transfers fail the error return -EREMOTEIO
    is assigned to err but then later overwritten when the tuner
    attach call is made.  Fix this by returning early with the
    error return code -EREMOTEIO on i2c transfer failure errors.
    
    If the transfer fails, an uninitialized value will be read from b2.

    e1000: Distribute switch variables for initialization
    
    [ Upstream commit a34c7f5156654ebaf7eaace102938be7ff7036cb ]
    
    Variables declared in a switch statement before any case statements
    cannot be automatically initialized with compiler instrumentation (as
    they are not part of any execution flow). With GCC's proposed automatic
    stack variable initialization feature, this triggers a warning (and they
    don't get initialized). Clang's automatic stack variable initialization
    (via CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL=y) doesn't throw a warning, but it also
    doesn't initialize such variables[1]. Note that these warnings (or silent
    skipping) happen before the dead-store elimination optimization phase,
    so even when the automatic initializations are later elided in favor of
    direct initializations, the warnings remain.
    
    To avoid these problems, move such variables into the "case" where
    they're used or lift them up into the main function body.

    tools api fs: Make xxx__mountpoint() more scalable
    
    [ Upstream commit c6fddb28bad26e5472cb7acf7b04cd5126f1a4ab ]
    
    The xxx_mountpoint() interface provided by fs.c finds mount points for
    common pseudo filesystems. The first time xxx_mountpoint() is invoked,
    it scans the mount table (/proc/mounts) looking for a match. If found,
    it is cached. The price to scan /proc/mounts is paid once if the mount
    is found.
    
    When the mount point is not found, subsequent calls to xxx_mountpoint()
    scan /proc/mounts over and over again.  There is no caching.
    
    This causes a scaling issue in perf record with hugeltbfs__mountpoint().
    The function is called for each process found in
    synthesize__mmap_events().  If the machine has thousands of processes
    and if the /proc/mounts has many entries this could cause major overhead
    in perf record. We have observed multi-second slowdowns on some
    configurations.
    
    As an example on a laptop:
    
    Before:
    
      $ sudo umount /dev/hugepages
      $ strace -e trace=openat -o /tmp/tt perf record -a ls
      $ fgrep mounts /tmp/tt
      285
    
    After:
    
      $ sudo umount /dev/hugepages
      $ strace -e trace=openat -o /tmp/tt perf record -a ls
      $ fgrep mounts /tmp/tt
      1
    
    One could argue that the non-caching in case the moint point is not
    found is intentional. That way subsequent calls may discover a moint
    point if the sysadmin mounts the filesystem. But the same argument could
    be made against caching the mount point. It could be unmounted causing
    errors.  It all depends on the intent of the interface. This patch
    assumes it is expected to scan /proc/mounts once. The patch documents
    the caching behavior in the fs.h header file.
    
    An alternative would be to just fix perf record. But it would solve the
    problem with hugetlbs__mountpoint() but there could be similar issues
    (possibly down the line) with other xxx_mountpoint() calls in perf or
    other tools.

    net: vmxnet3: fix possible buffer overflow caused by bad DMA value in vmxnet3_get_rss()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3e1c6846b9e108740ef8a37be80314053f5dd52a ]
    
    The value adapter->rss_conf is stored in DMA memory, and it is assigned
    to rssConf, so rssConf->indTableSize can be modified at anytime by
    malicious hardware. Because rssConf->indTableSize is assigned to n,
    buffer overflow may occur when the code "rssConf->indTable[n]" is
    executed.
    
    To fix this possible bug, n is checked after being used.

    x86/kvm/hyper-v: Explicitly align hcall param for kvm_hyperv_exit
    
    [ Upstream commit f7d31e65368aeef973fab788aa22c4f1d5a6af66 ]
    
    The problem the patch is trying to address is the fact that 'struct
    kvm_hyperv_exit' has different layout on when compiling in 32 and 64 bit
    modes.
    
    In 64-bit mode the default alignment boundary is 64 bits thus
    forcing extra gaps after 'type' and 'msr' but in 32-bit mode the
    boundary is at 32 bits thus no extra gaps.
    
    This is an issue as even when the kernel is 64 bit, the userspace using
    the interface can be both 32 and 64 bit but the same 32 bit userspace has
    to work with 32 bit kernel.
    
    The issue is fixed by forcing the 64 bit layout, this leads to ABI
    change for 32 bit builds and while we are obviously breaking '32 bit
    userspace with 32 bit kernel' case, we're fixing the '32 bit userspace
    with 64 bit kernel' one.
    
    As the interface has no (known) users and 32 bit KVM is rather baroque
    nowadays, this seems like a reasonable decision.

    spi: dw: Fix Rx-only DMA transfers
    
    [ Upstream commit 46164fde6b7890e7a3982d54549947c8394c0192 ]
    
    Tx-only DMA transfers are working perfectly fine since in this case
    the code just ignores the Rx FIFO overflow interrupts. But it turns
    out the SPI Rx-only transfers are broken since nothing pushing any
    data to the shift registers, so the Rx FIFO is left empty and the
    SPI core subsystems just returns a timeout error. Since DW DMAC
    driver doesn't support something like cyclic write operations of
    a single byte to a device register, the only way to support the
    Rx-only SPI transfers is to fake it by using a dummy Tx-buffer.
    This is what we intend to fix in this commit by setting the
    SPI_CONTROLLER_MUST_TX flag for DMA-capable platform.

    mmc: meson-mx-sdio: trigger a soft reset after a timeout or CRC error
    
    [ Upstream commit 91995b904ec2e44b5c159ac6a5d3f154345a4de7 ]
    
    The vendor driver (from the 3.10 kernel) triggers a soft reset every
    time before starting a new command. While this fixes a problem where
    SDIO cards are not detected at all (because all commands simply
    timed out) this hurts SD card read performance a bit (in my tests
    between 10% to 20%).
    
    Trigger a soft reset after we got a CRC error or if the previous command
    timed out (just like the vendor driver from the same 3.10 kernel for the
    newer SDHC controller IP does). This fixes detection of SDIO cards and
    doesn't hurt SD card read performance at the same time.
    
    With this patch the initialization of an RTL8723BS SDIO card looks like
    this:

    [ Upstream commit 9ad346c90509ebd983f60da7d082f261ad329507 ]
    
    The commit 8c46fcd78308 ("batman-adv: disable ethtool link speed detection
    when auto negotiation off") disabled the usage of ethtool's link_ksetting
    when auto negotation was enabled due to invalid values when used with
    tun/tap virtual net_devices. According to the patch, automatic measurements
    should be used for these kind of interfaces.
    
    But there are major flaws with this argumentation:
    
    * automatic measurements are not implemented
    * auto negotiation has nothing to do with the validity of the retrieved
      values
    
    The first point has to be fixed by a longer patch series. The "validity"
    part of the second point must be addressed in the same patch series by
    dropping the usage of ethtool's link_ksetting (thus always doing automatic
    measurements over ethernet).
    
    Drop the patch again to have more default values for various net_device
    types/configurations. The user can still overwrite them using the
    batadv_hardif's BATADV_ATTR_THROUGHPUT_OVERRIDE.

    ARM: 8978/1: mm: make act_mm() respect THREAD_SIZE
    
    [ Upstream commit e1de94380af588bdf6ad6f0cc1f75004c35bc096 ]
    
    Recent work with KASan exposed the folling hard-coded bitmask
    in arch/arm/mm/proc-macros.S:
    
      bic     rd, sp, #8128
      bic     rd, rd, #63
    
    This forms the bitmask 0x1FFF that is coinciding with
    (PAGE_SIZE << THREAD_SIZE_ORDER) - 1, this code was assuming
    that THREAD_SIZE is always 8K (8192).
    
    As KASan was increasing THREAD_SIZE_ORDER to 2, I ran into
    this bug.
    
    Fix it by this little oneline suggested by Ard:
    
      bic     rd, sp, #(THREAD_SIZE - 1) & ~63
    
    Where THREAD_SIZE is defined using THREAD_SIZE_ORDER.
    
    We have to also include <linux/const.h> since the THREAD_SIZE
    expands to use the _AC() macro.

    btrfs: do not ignore error from btrfs_next_leaf() when inserting checksums
    
    [ Upstream commit 7e4a3f7ed5d54926ec671bbb13e171cfe179cc50 ]
    
    We are currently treating any non-zero return value from btrfs_next_leaf()
    the same way, by going to the code that inserts a new checksum item in the
    tree. However if btrfs_next_leaf() returns an error (a value < 0), we
    should just stop and return the error, and not behave as if nothing has
    happened, since in that case we do not have a way to know if there is a
    next leaf or we are currently at the last leaf already.
    
    So fix that by returning the error from btrfs_next_leaf().

    clocksource: dw_apb_timer_of: Fix missing clockevent timers
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d2e16a3181bafb77b535095c39ad1c8b9558c8c ]
    
    Commit 100214889973 ("clocksource: dw_apb_timer_of: use
    clocksource_of_init") replaced a publicly available driver
    initialization method with one called by the timer_probe() method
    available after CLKSRC_OF. In current implementation it traverses
    all the timers available in the system and calls their initialization
    methods if corresponding devices were either in dtb or in acpi. But
    if before the commit any number of available timers would be installed
    as clockevent and clocksource devices, after that there would be at most
    two. The rest are just ignored since default case branch doesn't do
    anything. I don't see a reason of such behaviour, neither the commit
    message explains it. Moreover this might be wrong if on some platforms
    these timers might be used for different purpose, as virtually CPU-local
    clockevent timers and as an independent broadcast timer. So in order
    to keep the compatibility with the platforms where the order of the
    timers detection has some meaning, lets add the secondly discovered
    timer to be of clocksource/sched_clock type, while the very first and
    the others would provide the clockevents service.

    clocksource: dw_apb_timer: Make CPU-affiliation being optional
    
    [ Upstream commit cee43dbf2ee3f430434e2b66994eff8a1aeda889 ]
    
    Currently the DW APB Timer driver binds each clockevent timers to a
    particular CPU. This isn't good for multiple reasons. First of all seeing
    the device is placed on APB bus (which makes it accessible from any CPU
    core), accessible over MMIO and having the DYNIRQ flag set we can be sure
    that manually binding the timer to any CPU just isn't correct. By doing
    so we just set an extra limitation on device usage. This also doesn't
    reflect the device actual capability, since by setting the IRQ affinity
    we can make it virtually local to any CPU. Secondly imagine if you had a
    real CPU-local timer with the same rating and the same CPU-affinity.
    In this case if DW APB timer was registered first, then due to the
    clockevent framework tick-timer selection procedure we'll end up with the
    real CPU-local timer being left unselected for clock-events tracking. But
    on most of the platforms (MIPS/ARM/etc) such timers are normally embedded
    into the CPU core and are accessible with much better performance then
    devices placed on APB. For instance in MIPS architectures there is
    r4k-timer, which is CPU-local, assigned with the same rating, and normally
    its clockevent device is registered after the platform-specific one.
    
    So in order to fix all of these issues let's make the DW APB Timer CPU
    affinity being optional and deactivated by passing a negative CPU id,
    which will effectively set the DW APB clockevent timer cpumask to
    'cpu_possible_mask'.

    spi: dw: Enable interrupts in accordance with DMA xfer mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 43dba9f3f98c2b184a19f856f06fe22817bfd9e0 ]
    
    It's pointless to track the Tx overrun interrupts if Rx-only SPI
    transfer is issued. Similarly there is no need in handling the Rx
    overrun/underrun interrupts if Tx-only SPI transfer is executed.
    So lets unmask the interrupts only if corresponding SPI
    transactions are implied.

    kgdb: Disable WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED for all kgdb
    
    [ Upstream commit 202164fbfa2b2ffa3e66b504e0f126ba9a745006 ]
    
    In commit 81eaadcae81b ("kgdboc: disable the console lock when in
    kgdb") we avoided the WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED() yell when we were in
    kgdboc.  That still works fine, but it turns out that we get a similar
    yell when using other I/O drivers.  One example is the "I/O driver"
    for the kgdb test suite (kgdbts).  When I enabled that I again got the
    same yells.
    
    Even though "kgdbts" doesn't actually interact with the user over the
    console, using it still causes kgdb to print to the consoles.  That
    trips the same warning:
      con_is_visible+0x60/0x68
      con_scroll+0x110/0x1b8
      lf+0x4c/0xc8

    Let's increment/decrement the "ignore_console_lock_warning" variable
    all the time when we enter the debugger.
    
    This will allow us to later revert commit 81eaadcae81b ("kgdboc:

    packet (which include headroom and tailroom for skb_shared_info).
    
    This is done correctly in ixgbe_build_skb(), but in ixgbe_rx_buffer_flip
    which is currently only called on XDP_TX and XDP_REDIRECT, it forgets
    to add the tailroom for skb_shared_info. This breaks XDP_REDIRECT, for
    veth and cpumap.  Fix by adding size of skb_shared_info tailroom.
    
    Maintainers notice: This fix have been queued to Jeff.

    arm64: insn: Fix two bugs in encoding 32-bit logical immediates
    
    [ Upstream commit 579d1b3faa3735e781ff74aac0afd598515dbc63 ]
    
    This patch fixes two issues present in the current function for encoding
    arm64 logical immediates when using the 32-bit variants of instructions.
    
    First, the code does not correctly reject an all-ones 32-bit immediate,
    and returns an undefined instruction encoding.
    
    Second, the code incorrectly rejects some 32-bit immediates that are
    actually encodable as logical immediates. The root cause is that the code
    uses a default mask of 64-bit all-ones, even for 32-bit immediates.
    This causes an issue later on when the default mask is used to fill the
    top bits of the immediate with ones, shown here:
    
      /*
       * Pattern: 0..01..10..01..1
       *
       * Fill the unused top bits with ones, and check if
       * the result is a valid immediate (all ones with a
       * contiguous ranges of zeroes).
       */
      imm |= ~mask;
      if (!range_of_ones(~imm))
              return AARCH64_BREAK_FAULT;
    
    To see the problem, consider an immediate of the form 0..01..10..01..1,
    where the upper 32 bits are zero, such as 0x80000001. The code checks
    if ~(imm | ~mask) contains a range of ones: the incorrect mask yields
    1..10..01..10..0, which fails the check; the correct mask yields
    0..01..10..0, which succeeds.
    
    The fix for both issues is to generate a correct mask based on the
    instruction immediate size, and use the mask to check for all-ones,
    all-zeroes, and values wider than the mask.
    
    Currently, arch/arm64/kvm/va_layout.c is the only user of this function,
    which uses 64-bit immediates and therefore won't trigger these bugs.
    
    We tested the new code against llvm-mc with all 1,302 encodable 32-bit
    logical immediates and all 5,334 encodable 64-bit logical immediates.

    arm64: cacheflush: Fix KGDB trap detection
    
    [ Upstream commit ab8ad279ceac4fc78ae4dcf1a26326e05695e537 ]
    
    flush_icache_range() contains a bodge to avoid issuing IPIs when the kgdb
    trap handler is running because issuing IPIs is unsafe (and not needed)
    in this execution context. However the current test, based on
    kgdb_connected is flawed: it both over-matches and under-matches.
    
    The over match occurs because kgdb_connected is set when gdb attaches
    to the stub and remains set during normal running. This is relatively
    harmelss because in almost all cases irq_disabled() will be false.
    
    The under match is more serious. When kdb is used instead of kgdb to access
    the debugger then kgdb_connected is not set in all the places that the
    debug core updates sw breakpoints (and hence flushes the icache). This
    can lead to deadlock.
    
    Fix by replacing the ad-hoc check with the proper kgdb macro. This also
    allows us to drop the #ifdef wrapper.

    efi/libstub/x86: Work around LLVM ELF quirk build regression
    
    [ Upstream commit f77767ed5f4d398b29119563155e4ece2dfeee13 ]
    
    When building the x86 EFI stub with Clang, the libstub Makefile rules
    that manipulate the ELF object files may throw an error like:
    
        STUBCPY drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/efi-stub-helper.stub.o
      strip: drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/efi-stub-helper.stub.o: Failed to find link section for section 10
      objcopy: drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/efi-stub-helper.stub.o: Failed to find link section for section 10
    
    This is the result of a LLVM feature [0] where symbol references are
    stored in a LLVM specific .llvm_addrsig section in a non-transparent way,
    causing generic ELF tools such as strip or objcopy to choke on them.
    
    So force the compiler not to emit these sections, by passing the
    appropriate command line option.

    With a couple allies at Intel, and much badgering, I got confirmation
    from Intel that at least BXT suffers from the same SPI chip-select
    issue as Cannonlake (and beyond). The issue being that after going
    through runtime suspend/resume, toggling the chip-select line without
    also sending data does nothing.
    
    Add the quirk to BXT to briefly toggle dynamic clock gating off and
    on, forcing the fabric to wake up enough to notice the CS register
    change.

    [ Upstream commit eebac678556d6927f09a992872f4464cf3aecc76 ]
    
    DMADEVICES is the top-level option for the slave DMA
    subsystem, and should not be selected by device drivers,
    as this can cause circular dependencies such as:
    
    drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/Kconfig:6:error: recursive dependency detected!
    drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/Kconfig:6:       symbol NET_VENDOR_FREESCALE depends on PPC_BESTCOMM

    drivers/crypto/ccp/Kconfig:10:  symbol CRYPTO_DEV_SP_CCP depends on CRYPTO
    crypto/Kconfig:16:      symbol CRYPTO is selected by LIBCRC32C
    lib/Kconfig:222:        symbol LIBCRC32C is selected by LIQUIDIO
    drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/Kconfig:65: symbol LIQUIDIO depends on PTP_1588_CLOCK

    drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/Kconfig:23:      symbol FEC depends on NET_VENDOR_FREESCALE
    
    The LIQUIDIO driver causing this problem is addressed in a
    separate patch, but this change is needed to prevent it from
    happening again.
    
    Using "depends on DMADEVICES" is what we do for all other
    implementations of slave DMA controllers as well.

    KVM: arm64: Synchronize sysreg state on injecting an AArch32 exception
    
    commit 0370964dd3ff7d3d406f292cb443a927952cbd05 upstream.
    
    On a VHE system, the EL1 state is left in the CPU most of the time,
    and only syncronized back to memory when vcpu_put() is called (most
    of the time on preemption).
    
    Which means that when injecting an exception, we'd better have a way
    to either:
    (1) write directly to the EL1 sysregs
    (2) synchronize the state back to memory, and do the changes there
    
    For an AArch64, we already do (1), so we are safe. Unfortunately,
    doing the same thing for AArch32 would be pretty invasive. Instead,
    we can easily implement (2) by calling the put/load architectural
    backends, and keep preemption disabled. We can then reload the
    state back into EL1.

    During some scenarios mmc_sdio_init_card() runs a retry path for the UHS-I
    specific initialization, which leads to removal of the previously allocated
    card. A new card is then re-allocated while retrying.

    already removed card, which likely leads to a NULL pointer exception. So,
    let's fix this.

    mmc: sdhci-msm: Clear tuning done flag while hs400 tuning
    
    commit 9253d71011c349d5f5cc0cebdf68b4a80811b92d upstream.
    
    Clear tuning_done flag while executing tuning to ensure vendor
    specific HS400 settings are applied properly when the controller
    is re-initialized in HS400 mode.
    
    Without this, re-initialization of the qcom SDHC in HS400 mode fails
    while resuming the driver from runtime-suspend or system-suspend.

    agp/intel: Reinforce the barrier after GTT updates
    
    commit f30d3ced9fafa03e4855508929b5b6334907f45e upstream.
    
    After changing the timing between GTT updates and execution on the GPU,
    we started seeing sporadic failures on Ironlake. These were narrowed
    down to being an insufficiently strong enough barrier/delay after
    updating the GTT and scheduling execution on the GPU. By forcing the
    uncached read, and adding the missing barrier for the singular
    insert_page (relocation paths), the sporadic failures go away.
    
    Fixes: 983d308cb8f6 ("agp/intel: Serialise after GTT updates")
    Fixes: 3497971a71d8 ("agp/intel: Flush chipset writes after updating a single PTE")

    perf: Add cond_resched() to task_function_call()
    
    commit 2ed6edd33a214bca02bd2b45e3fc3038a059436b upstream.
    
    Under rare circumstances, task_function_call() can repeatedly fail and
    cause a soft lockup.
    
    There is a slight race where the process is no longer running on the cpu
    we targeted by the time remote_function() runs.  The code will simply
    try again.  If we are very unlucky, this will continue to fail, until a
    watchdog fires.  This can happen in a heavily loaded, multi-core virtual
    machine.

    If FAT length == 0, the image doesn't have any data. And it can be the
    cause of overlapping the root dir and FAT entries.

    mm/slub: fix a memory leak in sysfs_slab_add()
    
    commit dde3c6b72a16c2db826f54b2d49bdea26c3534a2 upstream.
    
    syzkaller reports for memory leak when kobject_init_and_add() returns an
    error in the function sysfs_slab_add() [1]
    
    When this happened, the function kobject_put() is not called for the
    corresponding kobject, which potentially leads to memory leak.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by calling kobject_put() even if
    kobject_init_and_add() fails.
    
    [1]
      BUG: memory leak

    drm/vkms: Hold gem object while still in-use
    
    commit 0ea2ea42b31abc1141f2fd3911f952a97d401fcb upstream.
    
    We need to keep the reference to the drm_gem_object
    until the last access by vkms_dumb_create.
    
    Therefore, the put the object after it is used.
    
    This fixes a use-after-free issue reported by syzbot.
    
    While here, change vkms_gem_create() symbol to static.

    scsi: megaraid_sas: TM command refire leads to controller firmware crash
    
    commit 6fd8525a70221c26823b1c7e912fb21f218fb0c5 upstream.
    
    When TM command times out, driver invokes the controller reset. Post reset,
    driver re-fires pended TM commands which leads to firmware crash.
    
    Post controller reset, return pended TM commands back to OS.

    KVM: arm64: Make vcpu_cp1x() work on Big Endian hosts
    
    commit 3204be4109ad681523e3461ce64454c79278450a upstream.
    
    AArch32 CP1x registers are overlayed on their AArch64 counterparts
    in the vcpu struct. This leads to an interesting problem as they
    are stored in their CPU-local format, and thus a CP1x register
    doesn't "hit" the lower 32bit portion of the AArch64 register on
    a BE host.
    
    To workaround this unfortunate situation, introduce a bias trick
    in the vcpu_cp1x() accessors which picks the correct half of the
    64bit register.

    KVM: MIPS: Fix VPN2_MASK definition for variable cpu_vmbits
    
    commit 5816c76dea116a458f1932eefe064e35403248eb upstream.
    
    If a CPU support more than 32bit vmbits (which is true for 64bit CPUs),
    VPN2_MASK set to fixed 0xffffe000 will lead to a wrong EntryHi in some
    functions such as _kvm_mips_host_tlb_inv().
    
    The cpu_vmbits definition of 32bit CPU in cpu-features.h is 31, so we
    still use the old definition.

    set asid_mask to cpuinfo->asid_mask.

    be changed to cpu_asid_mask(&boot_cpu_data).

    KVM: nVMX: Consult only the "basic" exit reason when routing nested exit
    
    commit 2ebac8bb3c2d35f5135466490fc8eeaf3f3e2d37 upstream.
    
    Consult only the basic exit reason, i.e. bits 15:0 of vmcs.EXIT_REASON,
    when determining whether a nested VM-Exit should be reflected into L1 or
    handled by KVM in L0.
    
    For better or worse, the switch statement in nested_vmx_exit_reflected()
    currently defaults to "true", i.e. reflects any nested VM-Exit without
    dedicated logic.  Because the case statements only contain the basic
    exit reason, any VM-Exit with modifier bits set will be reflected to L1,
    even if KVM intended to handle it in L0.
    
    Practically speaking, this only affects EXIT_REASON_MCE_DURING_VMENTRY,
    i.e. a #MC that occurs on nested VM-Enter would be incorrectly routed to
    L1, as "failed VM-Entry" is the only modifier that KVM can currently
    encounter.  The SMM modifiers will never be generated as KVM doesn't
    support/employ a SMI Transfer Monitor.  Ditto for "exit from enclave",
    as KVM doesn't yet support virtualizing SGX, i.e. it's impossible to
    enter an enclave in a KVM guest (L1 or L2).

    proc: Use new_inode not new_inode_pseudo
    
    commit ef1548adada51a2f32ed7faef50aa465e1b4c5da upstream.
    
    Recently syzbot reported that unmounting proc when there is an ongoing
    inotify watch on the root directory of proc could result in a use
    after free when the watch is removed after the unmount of proc
    when the watcher exits.
    
    Commit 69879c01a0c3 ("proc: Remove the now unnecessary internal mount
    of proc") made it easier to unmount proc and allowed syzbot to see the
    problem, but looking at the code it has been around for a long time.
    
    Looking at the code the fsnotify watch should have been removed by
    fsnotify_sb_delete in generic_shutdown_super.  Unfortunately the inode
    was allocated with new_inode_pseudo instead of new_inode so the inode
    was not on the sb->s_inodes list.  Which prevented
    fsnotify_unmount_inodes from finding the inode and removing the watch
    as well as made it so the "VFS: Busy inodes after unmount" warning
    could not find the inodes to warn about them.
    
    Make all of the inodes in proc visible to generic_shutdown_super,
    and fsnotify_sb_delete by using new_inode instead of new_inode_pseudo.
    The only functional difference is that new_inode places the inodes
    on the sb->s_inodes list.
    
    I wrote a small test program and I can verify that without changes it
    can trigger this issue, and by replacing new_inode_pseudo with
    new_inode the issues goes away.

    ovl: initialize error in ovl_copy_xattr
    
    commit 520da69d265a91c6536c63851cbb8a53946974f0 upstream.
    
    In ovl_copy_xattr, if all the xattrs to be copied are overlayfs private
    xattrs, the copy loop will terminate without assigning anything to the
    error variable, thus returning an uninitialized value.
    
    If ovl_copy_xattr is called from ovl_clear_empty, this uninitialized error
    value is put into a pointer by ERR_PTR(), causing potential invalid memory
    accesses down the line.
    
    This commit initialize error with 0. This is the correct value because when
    there's no xattr to copy, because all xattrs are private, ovl_copy_xattr
    should succeed.
    
    This bug is discovered with the help of INIT_STACK_ALL and clang.

    crypto: virtio: Fix use-after-free in virtio_crypto_skcipher_finalize_req()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c855f0720ff006d75d0a2512c7f6c4f60ff60ee ]
    
    The system'll crash when the users insmod crypto/tcrypto.ko with mode=155
    ( testing "authenc(hmac(sha1),cbc(aes))" ). It's caused by reuse the memory
    of request structure.
    
    In crypto_authenc_init_tfm(), the reqsize is set to:
      [PART 1] sizeof(authenc_request_ctx) +
      [PART 2] ictx->reqoff +
      [PART 3] MAX(ahash part, skcipher part)
    and the 'PART 3' is used by both ahash and skcipher in turn.
    
    When the virtio_crypto driver finish skcipher req, it'll call ->complete
    callback(in crypto_finalize_skcipher_request) and then free its
    resources whose pointers are recorded in 'skcipher parts'.
    
    However, the ->complete is 'crypto_authenc_encrypt_done' in this case,
    it will use the 'ahash part' of the request and change its content,
    so virtio_crypto driver will get the wrong pointer after ->complete
    finish and mistakenly free some other's memory. So the system will crash
    when these memory will be used again.
    
    The resources which need to be cleaned up are not used any more. But the
    pointers of these resources may be changed in the function
    "crypto_finalize_skcipher_request". Thus release specific resources before
    calling this function.

    spi: pxa2xx: Fix runtime PM ref imbalance on probe error
    
    [ Upstream commit 65e318e17358a3fd4fcb5a69d89b14016dee2f06 ]
    
    The PXA2xx SPI driver releases a runtime PM ref in the probe error path
    even though it hasn't acquired a ref earlier.
    
    Apparently commit e2b714afee32 ("spi: pxa2xx: Disable runtime PM if
    controller registration fails") sought to copy-paste the invocation of
    pm_runtime_disable() from pxa2xx_spi_remove(), but erroneously copied
    the call to pm_runtime_put_noidle() as well.  Drop it.

    spi: pxa2xx: Balance runtime PM enable/disable on error
    
    [ Upstream commit 1274204542f683e1d8491ebe9cc86284d5a8ebcc ]
    
    Don't undo the PM initialization if we error out before we managed to
    initialize it. The call to pm_runtime_disable() without being preceded
    by pm_runtime_enable() would disturb the balance of the Force.
    
    In practice, this happens if we fail to allocate any of the GPIOS ("cs",
    "ready") due to -EPROBE_DEFER because we're getting probled before the
    GPIO driver.

    spi: bcm2835: Fix controller unregister order
    
    [ Upstream commit 9dd277ff92d06f6aa95b39936ad83981d781f49b ]
    
    The BCM2835 SPI driver uses devm_spi_register_controller() on bind.
    As a consequence, on unbind, __device_release_driver() first invokes
    bcm2835_spi_remove() before unregistering the SPI controller via
    devres_release_all().
    
    This order is incorrect:  bcm2835_spi_remove() tears down the DMA
    channels and turns off the SPI controller, including its interrupts
    and clock.  The SPI controller is thus no longer usable.
    
    When the SPI controller is subsequently unregistered, it unbinds all
    its slave devices.  If their drivers need to access the SPI bus,
    e.g. to quiesce their interrupts, unbinding will fail.
    
    As a rule, devm_spi_register_controller() must not be used if the
    ->remove() hook performs teardown steps which shall be performed
    after unbinding of slaves.
    
    Fix by using the non-devm variant spi_register_controller().  Note that
    the struct spi_controller as well as the driver-private data are not
    freed until after bcm2835_spi_remove() has finished, so accessing them
    is safe.

    spi: pxa2xx: Fix controller unregister order
    
    [ Upstream commit 32e5b57232c0411e7dea96625c415510430ac079 ]
    
    The PXA2xx SPI driver uses devm_spi_register_controller() on bind.
    As a consequence, on unbind, __device_release_driver() first invokes
    pxa2xx_spi_remove() before unregistering the SPI controller via
    devres_release_all().
    
    This order is incorrect:  pxa2xx_spi_remove() disables the chip,
    rendering the SPI bus inaccessible even though the SPI controller is
    still registered.  When the SPI controller is subsequently unregistered,
    it unbinds all its slave devices.  Because their drivers cannot access
    the SPI bus, e.g. to quiesce interrupts, the slave devices may be left
    in an improper state.
    
    As a rule, devm_spi_register_controller() must not be used if the
    ->remove() hook performs teardown steps which shall be performed after
    unregistering the controller and specifically after unbinding of slaves.
    
    Fix by reverting to the non-devm variant of spi_register_controller().
    
    An alternative approach would be to use device-managed functions for all
    steps in pxa2xx_spi_remove(), e.g. by calling devm_add_action_or_reset()
    on probe.  However that approach would add more LoC to the driver and
    it wouldn't lend itself as well to backporting to stable.
    
    The improper use of devm_spi_register_controller() was introduced in 2013
    by commit a807fcd090d6 ("spi: pxa2xx: use devm_spi_register_master()"),
    but all earlier versions of the driver going back to 2006 were likewise
    broken because they invoked spi_unregister_master() at the end of
    pxa2xx_spi_remove(), rather than at the beginning.

    However since commit ffbbdd21329f ("spi: create a message queueing

    x86/speculation: PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE enforcement for indirect branches.
    
    [ Upstream commit 4d8df8cbb9156b0a0ab3f802b80cb5db57acc0bf ]
    
    Currently, it is possible to enable indirect branch speculation even after
    it was force-disabled using the PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE option. Moreover, the
    PR_GET_SPECULATION_CTRL command gives afterwards an incorrect result
    (force-disabled when it is in fact enabled). This also is inconsistent
    vs. STIBP and the documention which cleary states that
    PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE cannot be undone.
    
    Fix this by actually enforcing force-disabled indirect branch
    speculation. PR_SPEC_ENABLE called after PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE now fails
    with -EPERM as described in the documentation.

    x86/speculation: Avoid force-disabling IBPB based on STIBP and enhanced IBRS.
    
    [ Upstream commit 21998a351512eba4ed5969006f0c55882d995ada ]
    
    When STIBP is unavailable or enhanced IBRS is available, Linux
    force-disables the IBPB mitigation of Spectre-BTB even when simultaneous
    multithreading is disabled. While attempts to enable IBPB using
    prctl(PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL, PR_SPEC_INDIRECT_BRANCH, ...) fail with
    EPERM, the seccomp syscall (or its prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, ...) equivalent)
    which are used e.g. by Chromium or OpenSSH succeed with no errors but the
    application remains silently vulnerable to cross-process Spectre v2 attacks
    (classical BTB poisoning). At the same time the SYSFS reporting
    (/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2) displays that IBPB is
    conditionally enabled when in fact it is unconditionally disabled.
    
    STIBP is useful only when SMT is enabled. When SMT is disabled and STIBP is
    unavailable, it makes no sense to force-disable also IBPB, because IBPB
    protects against cross-process Spectre-BTB attacks regardless of the SMT
    state. At the same time since missing STIBP was only observed on AMD CPUs,
    AMD does not recommend using STIBP, but recommends using IBPB, so disabling
    IBPB because of missing STIBP goes directly against AMD's advice:
    https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/Architecture_Guidelines_Update_Indirect_Branch_Control.pdf
    
    Similarly, enhanced IBRS is designed to protect cross-core BTB poisoning
    and BTB-poisoning attacks from user space against kernel (and
    BTB-poisoning attacks from guest against hypervisor), it is not designed
    to prevent cross-process (or cross-VM) BTB poisoning between processes (or
    VMs) running on the same core. Therefore, even with enhanced IBRS it is
    necessary to flush the BTB during context-switches, so there is no reason
    to force disable IBPB when enhanced IBRS is available.
    
    Enable the prctl control of IBPB even when STIBP is unavailable or enhanced
    IBRS is available.

    x86/speculation: Add support for STIBP always-on preferred mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 20c3a2c33e9fdc82e9e8e8d2a6445b3256d20191 ]
    
    Different AMD processors may have different implementations of STIBP.
    When STIBP is conditionally enabled, some implementations would benefit
    from having STIBP always on instead of toggling the STIBP bit through MSR
    writes. This preference is advertised through a CPUID feature bit.
    
    When conditional STIBP support is requested at boot and the CPU advertises
    STIBP always-on mode as preferred, switch to STIBP "on" support. To show
    that this transition has occurred, create a new spectre_v2_user_mitigation
    value and a new spectre_v2_user_strings message. The new mitigation value
    is used in spectre_v2_user_select_mitigation() to print the new mitigation
    message as well as to return a new string from stibp_state().

    KVM: x86: only do L1TF workaround on affected processors
    
    [ Upstream commit d43e2675e96fc6ae1a633b6a69d296394448cc32 ]
    
    KVM stores the gfn in MMIO SPTEs as a caching optimization.  These are split
    in two parts, as in "[high 11111 low]", to thwart any attempt to use these bits
    in an L1TF attack.  This works as long as there are 5 free bits between
    MAXPHYADDR and bit 50 (inclusive), leaving bit 51 free so that the MMIO
    access triggers a reserved-bit-set page fault.
    
    The bit positions however were computed wrongly for AMD processors that have
    encryption support.  In this case, x86_phys_bits is reduced (for example
    from 48 to 43, to account for the C bit at position 47 and four bits used
    internally to store the SEV ASID and other stuff) while x86_cache_bits in
    would remain set to 48, and _all_ bits between the reduced MAXPHYADDR
    and bit 51 are set.  Then low_phys_bits would also cover some of the
    bits that are set in the shadow_mmio_value, terribly confusing the gfn
    caching mechanism.
    
    To fix this, avoid splitting gfns as long as the processor does not have
    the L1TF bug (which includes all AMD processors).  When there is no
    splitting, low_phys_bits can be set to the reduced MAXPHYADDR removing
    the overlap.  This fixes "npt=0" operation on EPYC processors.
    
    Thanks to Maxim Levitsky for bisecting this bug.

    kvm: x86: Fix L1TF mitigation for shadow MMU
    
    [ Upstream commit 61455bf26236e7f3d72705382a6437fdfd1bd0af ]
    
    Currently KVM sets 5 most significant bits of physical address bits
    reported by CPUID (boot_cpu_data.x86_phys_bits) for nonpresent or
    reserved bits SPTE to mitigate L1TF attack from guest when using shadow
    MMU. However for some particular Intel CPUs the physical address bits
    of internal cache is greater than physical address bits reported by
    CPUID.
    
    Use the kernel's existing boot_cpu_data.x86_cache_bits to determine the
    five most significant bits. Doing so improves KVM's L1TF mitigation in
    the unlikely scenario that system RAM overlaps the high order bits of
    the "real" physical address space as reported by CPUID. This aligns with
    the kernel's warnings regarding L1TF mitigation, e.g. in the above
    scenario the kernel won't warn the user about lack of L1TF mitigation
    if x86_cache_bits is greater than x86_phys_bits.
    
    Also initialize shadow_nonpresent_or_rsvd_mask explicitly to make it
    consistent with other 'shadow_{xxx}_mask', and opportunistically add a
    WARN once if KVM's L1TF mitigation cannot be applied on a system that
    is marked as being susceptible to L1TF.

    Because of the above race, there can be a mismatch between the
    host physical address stored in the APIC_ACCESS_PAGE VMCS field and
    the host physical address stored in the EPT entry for the APIC GPA
    (0xfee0000).  When this happens, the processor will not trap APIC
    accesses, and will instead show the raw contents of the APIC-access page.
    Because Windows OS periodically checks for unexpected modifications to
    the LAPIC register, this will show up as a BSOD crash with BugCheck
    CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION (109) we are currently seeing in
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1751017.
    
    The root cause of the issue is that kvm_arch_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range()
    cannot guarantee that no additional references are taken to the pages in
    the range before kvm_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_end().  Fortunately,
    this case is supported by the MMU notifier API, as documented in
    include/linux/mmu_notifier.h:
    
             * If the subsystem
             * can't guarantee that no additional references are taken to
             * the pages in the range, it has to implement the
             * invalidate_range() notifier to remove any references taken
             * after invalidate_range_start().
    
    The fix therefore is to reload the APIC-access page field in the VMCS
    from kvm_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range() instead of ..._range_start().

    x86/{mce,mm}: Unmap the entire page if the whole page is affected and poisoned
    
    commit 17fae1294ad9d711b2c3dd0edef479d40c76a5e8 upstream.
    
    An interesting thing happened when a guest Linux instance took a machine
    check. The VMM unmapped the bad page from guest physical space and
    passed the machine check to the guest.
    
    Linux took all the normal actions to offline the page from the process
    that was using it. But then guest Linux crashed because it said there
    was a second machine check inside the kernel with this stack trace:
    
    do_memory_failure
        set_mce_nospec
             set_memory_uc
                  _set_memory_uc
                       change_page_attr_set_clr
                            cpa_flush
                                 clflush_cache_range_opt
    
    This was odd, because a CLFLUSH instruction shouldn't raise a machine
    check (it isn't consuming the data). Further investigation showed that
    the VMM had passed in another machine check because is appeared that the
    guest was accessing the bad page.
    
    Fix is to check the scope of the poison by checking the MCi_MISC register.
    If the entire page is affected, then unmap the page. If only part of the
    page is affected, then mark the page as uncacheable.
    
    This assumes that VMMs will do the logical thing and pass in the "whole
    page scope" via the MCi_MISC register (since they unmapped the entire
    page).

    Currently we set the tx/rx buffer to 0xff when NULL. This causes
    problems with some spi slaves where 0xff is a valid command. Looking
    at other drivers, the tx/rx buffer is usually set to 0x00 when NULL.
    Following this convention solves the issue.

    spi: bcm2835aux: Fix controller unregister order
    
    commit b9dd3f6d417258ad0beeb292a1bc74200149f15d upstream.
    
    The BCM2835aux SPI driver uses devm_spi_register_master() on bind.
    As a consequence, on unbind, __device_release_driver() first invokes
    bcm2835aux_spi_remove() before unregistering the SPI controller via
    devres_release_all().
    
    This order is incorrect:  bcm2835aux_spi_remove() turns off the SPI
    controller, including its interrupts and clock.  The SPI controller
    is thus no longer usable.
    
    When the SPI controller is subsequently unregistered, it unbinds all
    its slave devices.  If their drivers need to access the SPI bus,
    e.g. to quiesce their interrupts, unbinding will fail.
    
    As a rule, devm_spi_register_master() must not be used if the
    ->remove() hook performs teardown steps which shall be performed
    after unbinding of slaves.
    
    Fix by using the non-devm variant spi_register_master().  Note that the
    struct spi_master as well as the driver-private data are not freed until
    after bcm2835aux_spi_remove() has finished, so accessing them is safe.

    spi: dw: Fix controller unregister order
    
    commit ca8b19d61e3fce5d2d7790cde27a0b57bcb3f341 upstream.
    
    The Designware SPI driver uses devm_spi_register_controller() on bind.
    As a consequence, on unbind, __device_release_driver() first invokes
    dw_spi_remove_host() before unregistering the SPI controller via
    devres_release_all().
    
    This order is incorrect:  dw_spi_remove_host() shuts down the chip,
    rendering the SPI bus inaccessible even though the SPI controller is
    still registered.  When the SPI controller is subsequently unregistered,
    it unbinds all its slave devices.  Because their drivers cannot access
    the SPI bus, e.g. to quiesce interrupts, the slave devices may be left
    in an improper state.
    
    As a rule, devm_spi_register_controller() must not be used if the
    ->remove() hook performs teardown steps which shall be performed after
    unregistering the controller and specifically after unbinding of slaves.
    
    Fix by reverting to the non-devm variant of spi_register_controller().
    
    An alternative approach would be to use device-managed functions for all
    steps in dw_spi_remove_host(), e.g. by calling devm_add_action_or_reset()
    on probe.  However that approach would add more LoC to the driver and
    it wouldn't lend itself as well to backporting to stable.

    ACPI: PM: Avoid using power resources if there are none for D0
    
    commit 956ad9d98b73f59e442cc119c98ba1e04e94fe6d upstream.
    
    As recently reported, some platforms provide a list of power
    resources for device power state D3hot, through the _PR3 object,
    but they do not provide a list of power resources for device power
    state D0.
    
    Among other things, this causes acpi_device_get_power() to return
    D3hot as the current state of the device in question if all of the
    D3hot power resources are "on", because it sees the power_resources
    flag set and calls acpi_power_get_inferred_state() which finds that
    D3hot is the shallowest power state with all of the associated power
    resources turned "on", so that's what it returns.  Moreover, that
    value takes precedence over the acpi_dev_pm_explicit_get() return
    value, because it means a deeper power state.  The device may very
    well be in D0 physically at that point, however.
    
    Moreover, the presence of _PR3 without _PR0 for a given device
    means that only one D3-level power state can be supported by it.
    Namely, because there are no power resources to turn "off" when
    transitioning the device from D0 into D3cold (which should be
    supported since _PR3 is present), the evaluation of _PS3 should
    be sufficient to put it straight into D3cold, but this means that
    the effect of turning "on" the _PR3 power resources is unclear,
    so it is better to avoid doing that altogether.  Consequently,
    there is no practical way do distinguish D3cold from D3hot for
    the device in question and the power states of it can be labeled
    so that D3hot is the deepest supported one (and Linux assumes
    that putting a device into D3hot via ACPI may cause power to be
    removed from it anyway, for legacy reasons).
    
    To work around the problem described above modify the ACPI
    enumeration of devices so that power resources are only used
    for device power management if the list of D0 power resources
    is not empty and make it mart D3cold as supported only if that
    is the case and the D3hot list of power resources is not empty
    too.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix inconsistent card PM state after resume
    
    commit 862b2509d157c629dd26d7ac6c6cdbf043d332eb upstream.
    
    When a USB-audio interface gets runtime-suspended via auto-pm feature,
    the driver suspends all functionality and increment
    chip->num_suspended_intf.  Later on, when the system gets suspended to
    S3, the driver increments chip->num_suspended_intf again, skips the
    device changes, and sets the card power state to
    SNDRV_CTL_POWER_D3hot.  In return, when the system gets resumed from
    S3, the resume callback decrements chip->num_suspended_intf.  Since
    this refcount is still not zero (it's been runtime-suspended), the
    whole resume is skipped.  But there is a small pitfall here.
    
    The problem is that the driver doesn't restore the card power state
    after this resume call, leaving it as SNDRV_CTL_POWER_D3hot.  So,
    even after the system resume finishes, the card instance still appears
    as if it were system-suspended, and this confuses many ioctl accesses
    that are blocked unexpectedly.
    
    In details, we have two issues behind the scene: one is that the card
    power state is changed only when the refcount becomes zero, and
    another is that the prior auto-suspend check is kept in a boolean
    flag.  Although the latter problem is almost negligible since the
    auto-pm feature is imposed only on the primary interface, but this can
    be a potential problem on the devices with multiple interfaces.
    
    This patch addresses those issues by the following:
    
    - Replace chip->autosuspended boolean flag with chip->system_suspend
      counter
    
    - At the first system-suspend, chip->num_suspended_intf is recorded to
      chip->system_suspend
    
    - At system-resume, the card power state is restored when the
      chip->num_suspended_intf refcount reaches to chip->system_suspend,
      i.e. the state returns to the auto-suspended
    
    Also, the patch fixes yet another hidden problem by the code
    refactoring along with the fixes above: namely, when some resume
    procedure failed, the driver left chip->num_suspended_intf that was
    already decreased, and it might lead to the refcount unbalance.
    In the new code, the refcount decrement is done after the whole resume
    procedure, and the problem is avoided as well.

    x86/speculation: Prevent rogue cross-process SSBD shutdown
    
    commit dbbe2ad02e9df26e372f38cc3e70dab9222c832e upstream.
    
    On context switch the change of TIF_SSBD and TIF_SPEC_IB are evaluated
    to adjust the mitigations accordingly. This is optimized to avoid the
    expensive MSR write if not needed.
    
    This optimization is buggy and allows an attacker to shutdown the SSBD
    protection of a victim process.
    
    The update logic reads the cached base value for the speculation control
    MSR which has neither the SSBD nor the STIBP bit set. It then OR's the
    SSBD bit only when TIF_SSBD is different and requests the MSR update.
    
    That means if TIF_SSBD of the previous and next task are the same, then
    the base value is not updated, even if TIF_SSBD is set. The MSR write is
    not requested.
    
    Subsequently if the TIF_STIBP bit differs then the STIBP bit is updated
    in the base value and the MSR is written with a wrong SSBD value.
    
    This was introduced when the per task/process conditional STIPB
    switching was added on top of the existing SSBD switching.
    
    It is exploitable if the attacker creates a process which enforces SSBD
    and has the contrary value of STIBP than the victim process (i.e. if the
    victim process enforces STIBP, the attacker process must not enforce it;
    if the victim process does not enforce STIBP, the attacker process must
    enforce it) and schedule it on the same core as the victim process. If
    the victim runs after the attacker the victim becomes vulnerable to
    Spectre V4.
    
    To fix this, update the MSR value independent of the TIF_SSBD difference
    and dependent on the SSBD mitigation method available. This ensures that
    a subsequent STIPB initiated MSR write has the correct state of SSBD.

    x86_64: Fix jiffies ODR violation
    
    commit d8ad6d39c35d2b44b3d48b787df7f3359381dcbf upstream.
    
    'jiffies' and 'jiffies_64' are meant to alias (two different symbols that
    share the same address).  Most architectures make the symbols alias to the
    same address via a linker script assignment in their
    arch/<arch>/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S:
    
    jiffies = jiffies_64;
    
    which is effectively a definition of jiffies.
    
    jiffies and jiffies_64 are both forward declared for all architectures in
    include/linux/jiffies.h. jiffies_64 is defined in kernel/time/timer.c.
    
    x86_64 was peculiar in that it wasn't doing the above linker script
    assignment, but rather was:
    1. defining jiffies in arch/x86/kernel/time.c instead via the linker script.
    2. overriding the symbol jiffies_64 from kernel/time/timer.c in
    arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds.s via 'jiffies_64 = jiffies;'.
    
    As Fangrui notes:
    
      In LLD, symbol assignments in linker scripts override definitions in
      object files. GNU ld appears to have the same behavior. It would
      probably make sense for LLD to error "duplicate symbol" but GNU ld
      is unlikely to adopt for compatibility reasons.
    
    This results in an ODR violation (UB), which seems to have survived
    thus far. Where it becomes harmful is when;
    
    1. -fno-semantic-interposition is used:
    
    As Fangrui notes:
    
      Clang after LLVM commit 5b22bcc2b70d
      ("[X86][ELF] Prefer to lower MC_GlobalAddress operands to .Lfoo$local")
      defaults to -fno-semantic-interposition similar semantics which help
      -fpic/-fPIC code avoid GOT/PLT when the referenced symbol is defined
      within the same translation unit. Unlike GCC
      -fno-semantic-interposition, Clang emits such relocations referencing
      local symbols for non-pic code as well.
    
    This causes references to jiffies to refer to '.Ljiffies$local' when
    jiffies is defined in the same translation unit. Likewise, references to
    jiffies_64 become references to '.Ljiffies_64$local' in translation units
    that define jiffies_64.  Because these differ from the names used in the
    linker script, they will not be rewritten to alias one another.
    
    2. Full LTO
    
    Full LTO effectively treats all source files as one translation
    unit, causing these local references to be produced everywhere.  When
    the linker processes the linker script, there are no longer any
    references to jiffies_64' anywhere to replace with 'jiffies'.  And
    thus '.Ljiffies$local' and '.Ljiffies_64$local' no longer alias
    at all.
    
    In the process of porting patches enabling Full LTO from arm64 to x86_64,
    spooky bugs have been observed where the kernel appeared to boot, but init
    doesn't get scheduled.
    
    Avoid the ODR violation by matching other architectures and define jiffies
    only by linker script.  For -fno-semantic-interposition + Full LTO, there
    is no longer a global definition of jiffies for the compiler to produce a
    local symbol which the linker script won't ensure aliases to jiffies_64.

    aio: fix async fsync creds
    
    commit 530f32fc370fd1431ea9802dbc53ab5601dfccdb upstream.
    
    Avi Kivity reports that on fuse filesystems running in a user namespace
    asyncronous fsync fails with EOVERFLOW.
    
    The reason is that f_ops->fsync() is called with the creds of the kthread
    performing aio work instead of the creds of the process originally
    submitting IOCB_CMD_FSYNC.
    
    Fuse sends the creds of the caller in the request header and it needs to
    translate the uid and gid into the server's user namespace.  Since the
    kthread is running in init_user_ns, the translation will fail and the
    operation returns an error.
    
    It can be argued that fsync doesn't actually need any creds, but just
    zeroing out those fields in the header (as with requests that currently
    don't take creds) is a backward compatibility risk.
    
    Instead of working around this issue in fuse, solve the core of the problem
    by calling the filesystem with the proper creds.

    mm: add kvfree_sensitive() for freeing sensitive data objects
    
    [ Upstream commit d4eaa2837851db2bfed572898bfc17f9a9f9151e ]
    
    For kvmalloc'ed data object that contains sensitive information like
    cryptographic keys, we need to make sure that the buffer is always cleared
    before freeing it.  Using memset() alone for buffer clearing may not
    provide certainty as the compiler may compile it away.  To be sure, the
    special memzero_explicit() has to be used.
    
    This patch introduces a new kvfree_sensitive() for freeing those sensitive
    data objects allocated by kvmalloc().  The relevant places where
    kvfree_sensitive() can be used are modified to use it.

    mistakenly added erratum #1054 as an OS Visible Workaround (OSVW) ID 0.
    Erratum #1054 is not OSVW ID 0 [1], so make it a legacy erratum.
    
    There would never have been a false positive on older hardware that
    has OSVW bit 0 set, since the IRPERF feature was not available.
    
    However, save a couple of RDMSR executions per thread, on modern
    system configurations that correctly set non-zero values in their
    OSVW_ID_Length MSRs.

    If is_closed is set, and the event list is empty, then read() will return
    -EIO without blocking. After setting is_closed in
    ib_uverbs_free_event_queue(), we do trigger a wake_up on the poll_wait,

    powerpc/xive: Clear the page tables for the ESB IO mapping
    
    [ Upstream commit a101950fcb78b0ba20cd487be6627dea58d55c2b ]
    
    Commit 1ca3dec2b2df ("powerpc/xive: Prevent page fault issues in the
    machine crash handler") fixed an issue in the FW assisted dump of
    machines using hash MMU and the XIVE interrupt mode under the POWER
    hypervisor. It forced the mapping of the ESB page of interrupts being
    mapped in the Linux IRQ number space to make sure the 'crash kexec'
    sequence worked during such an event. But it didn't handle the
    un-mapping.
    
    This mapping is now blocking the removal of a passthrough IO adapter
    under the POWER hypervisor because it expects the guest OS to have
    cleared all page table entries related to the adapter. If some are
    still present, the RTAS call which isolates the PCI slot returns error
    9001 "valid outstanding translations".
    
    Remove these mapping in the IRQ data cleanup routine.
    
    Under KVM, this cleanup is not required because the ESB pages for the
    adapter interrupts are un-mapped from the guest by the hypervisor in
    the KVM XIVE native device. This is now redundant but it's harmless.

    ARM: 8977/1: ptrace: Fix mask for thumb breakpoint hook
    
    [ Upstream commit 3866f217aaa81bf7165c7f27362eee5d7919c496 ]
    
    call_undef_hook() in traps.c applies the same instr_mask for both 16-bit
    and 32-bit thumb instructions. If instr_mask then is only 16 bits wide
    (0xffff as opposed to 0xffffffff), the first half-word of 32-bit thumb
    instructions will be masked out. This makes the function match 32-bit
    thumb instructions where the second half-word is equal to instr_val,
    regardless of the first half-word.
    
    The result in this case is that all undefined 32-bit thumb instructions
    with the second half-word equal to 0xde01 (udf #1) work as breakpoints
    and will raise a SIGTRAP instead of a SIGILL, instead of just the one
    intended 16-bit instruction. An example of such an instruction is
    0xeaa0de01, which is unallocated according to Arm ARM and should raise a
    SIGILL, but instead raises a SIGTRAP.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by setting all the bits in instr_mask, which
    will still match the intended 16-bit thumb instruction (where the
    upper half is always 0), but not any 32-bit thumb instructions.

    [CAUSE]
    The offending csum tree looks like this:
    
      checksum tree key (CSUM_TREE ROOT_ITEM 0)
      node 29741056 level 1 items 14 free 107 generation 19 owner CSUM_TREE

              key (EXTENT_CSUM EXTENT_CSUM 85975040) block 29630464 gen 17
              key (EXTENT_CSUM EXTENT_CSUM 89911296) block 29642752 gen 17 <<<
              key (EXTENT_CSUM EXTENT_CSUM 92274688) block 29646848 gen 17
              ...
    
      leaf 29630464 items 6 free space 1 generation 17 owner CSUM_TREE
              item 0 key (EXTENT_CSUM EXTENT_CSUM 85975040) itemoff 3987 itemsize 8
                      range start 85975040 end 85983232 length 8192
              ...
      leaf 29642752 items 0 free space 3995 generation 17 owner 0
                          ^ empty leaf            invalid owner ^
    
      leaf 29646848 items 1 free space 602 generation 17 owner CSUM_TREE
              item 0 key (EXTENT_CSUM EXTENT_CSUM 92274688) itemoff 627 itemsize 3368
                      range start 92274688 end 95723520 length 3448832
    
    So we have a corrupted csum tree where one tree leaf is completely
    empty, causing unbalanced btree, thus leading to unexpected btree
    balance error.
    
    [FIX]
    For this particular case, we handle it in two directions to catch it:
    - Check if the tree block is empty through btrfs_verify_level_key()
      So that invalid tree blocks won't be read out through
      btrfs_search_slot() and its variants.
    
    - Check 0 tree owner in tree checker
      NO tree is using 0 as its tree owner, detect it and reject at tree
      block read time.

    lib: Reduce user_access_begin() boundaries in strncpy_from_user() and strnlen_user()
    
    commit ab10ae1c3bef56c29bac61e1201c752221b87b41 upstream.
    
    The range passed to user_access_begin() by strncpy_from_user() and
    strnlen_user() starts at 'src' and goes up to the limit of userspace
    although reads will be limited by the 'count' param.
    
    On 32 bits powerpc (book3s/32) access has to be granted for each
    256Mbytes segment and the cost increases with the number of segments to
    unlock.
    
    Limit the range with 'count' param.

    x86: uaccess: Inhibit speculation past access_ok() in user_access_begin()
    
    commit 6e693b3ffecb0b478c7050b44a4842854154f715 upstream.
    
    Commit 594cc251fdd0 ("make 'user_access_begin()' do 'access_ok()'")
    makes the access_ok() check part of the user_access_begin() preceding a
    series of 'unsafe' accesses.  This has the desirable effect of ensuring
    that all 'unsafe' accesses have been range-checked, without having to
    pick through all of the callsites to verify whether the appropriate
    checking has been made.
    
    However, the consolidated range check does not inhibit speculation, so
    it is still up to the caller to ensure that they are not susceptible to
    any speculative side-channel attacks for user addresses that ultimately
    fail the access_ok() check.
    
    This is an oversight, so use __uaccess_begin_nospec() to ensure that
    speculation is inhibited until the access_ok() check has passed.

    arch/openrisc: Fix issues with access_ok()
    
    commit 9cb2feb4d21d97386eb25c7b67e2793efcc1e70a upstream.
    
    The commit 594cc251fdd0 ("make 'user_access_begin()' do 'access_ok()'")
    exposed incorrect implementations of access_ok() macro in several
    architectures.  This change fixes 2 issues found in OpenRISC.
    
    OpenRISC was not properly using parenthesis for arguments and also using
    arguments twice.  This patch fixes those 2 issues.
    
    I test booted this patch with v5.0-rc1 on qemu and it's working fine.

    Fix 'acccess_ok()' on alpha and SH
    
    commit 94bd8a05cd4de344a9a57e52ef7d99550251984f upstream.
    
    Commit 594cc251fdd0 ("make 'user_access_begin()' do 'access_ok()'")
    broke both alpha and SH booting in qemu, as noticed by Guenter Roeck.
    
    It turns out that the bug wasn't actually in that commit itself (which
    would have been surprising: it was mostly a no-op), but in how the
    addition of access_ok() to the strncpy_from_user() and strnlen_user()
    functions now triggered the case where those functions would test the
    access of the very last byte of the user address space.
    
    The string functions actually did that user range test before too, but
    they did it manually by just comparing against user_addr_max().  But
    with user_access_begin() doing the check (using "access_ok()"), it now
    exposed problems in the architecture implementations of that function.
    
    For example, on alpha, the access_ok() helper macro looked like this:
    
      #define __access_ok(addr, size) \
            ((get_fs().seg & (addr | size | (addr+size))) == 0)
    
    and what it basically tests is of any of the high bits get set (the
    USER_DS masking value is 0xfffffc0000000000).
    
    And that's completely wrong for the "addr+size" check.  Because it's
    off-by-one for the case where we check to the very end of the user
    address space, which is exactly what the strn*_user() functions do.
    
    Why? Because "addr+size" will be exactly the size of the address space,
    so trying to access the last byte of the user address space will fail
    the __access_ok() check, even though it shouldn't.  As a result, the
    user string accessor functions failed consistently - because they
    literally don't know how long the string is going to be, and the max
    access is going to be that last byte of the user address space.
    
    Side note: that alpha macro is buggy for another reason too - it re-uses
    the arguments twice.
    
    And SH has another version of almost the exact same bug:
    
      #define __addr_ok(addr) \
            ((unsigned long __force)(addr) < current_thread_info()->addr_limit.seg)
    
    so far so good: yes, a user address must be below the limit.  But then:
    
      #define __access_ok(addr, size)         \
            (__addr_ok((addr) + (size)))
    
    is wrong with the exact same off-by-one case: the case when "addr+size"
    is exactly _equal_ to the limit is actually perfectly fine (think "one
    byte access at the last address of the user address space")
    
    The SH version is actually seriously buggy in another way: it doesn't
    actually check for overflow, even though it did copy the _comment_ that
    talks about overflow.
    
    So it turns out that both SH and alpha actually have completely buggy
    implementations of access_ok(), but they happened to work in practice
    (although the SH overflow one is a serious serious security bug, not
    that anybody likely cares about SH security).
    
    This fixes the problems by using a similar macro on both alpha and SH.
    It isn't trying to be clever, the end address is based on this logic:
    
            unsigned long __ao_end = __ao_a + __ao_b - !!__ao_b;
    
    which basically says "add start and length, and then subtract one unless
    the length was zero".  We can't subtract one for a zero length, or we'd
    just hit an underflow instead.
    
    For a lot of access_ok() users the length is a constant, so this isn't
    actually as expensive as it initially looks.

    make 'user_access_begin()' do 'access_ok()'
    
    commit 594cc251fdd0d231d342d88b2fdff4bc42fb0690 upstream.
    
    Originally, the rule used to be that you'd have to do access_ok()
    separately, and then user_access_begin() before actually doing the
    direct (optimized) user access.
    
    But experience has shown that people then decide not to do access_ok()
    at all, and instead rely on it being implied by other operations or
    similar.  Which makes it very hard to verify that the access has
    actually been range-checked.
    
    If you use the unsafe direct user accesses, hardware features (either
    SMAP - Supervisor Mode Access Protection - on x86, or PAN - Privileged
    Access Never - on ARM) do force you to use user_access_begin().  But
    nothing really forces the range check.
    
    By putting the range check into user_access_begin(), we actually force
    people to do the right thing (tm), and the range check vill be visible
    near the actual accesses.  We have way too long a history of people
    trying to avoid them.

    selftests: bpf: fix use of undeclared RET_IF macro
    
    commit 634efb750435 ("selftests: bpf: Reset global state between
    reuseport test runs") uses a macro RET_IF which doesn't exist in
    the v4.19 tree. It is defined as follows:
    
            #define RET_IF(condition, tag, format...) ({
                    if (CHECK_FAIL(condition)) {
                            printf(tag " " format);
                            return;
                    }
            })
    
    CHECK_FAIL in turn is defined as:
    
            #define CHECK_FAIL(condition) ({
                    int __ret = !!(condition);
                    int __save_errno = errno;
                    if (__ret) {
                            test__fail();
                            fprintf(stdout, "%s:FAIL:%d\n", __func__, __LINE__);
                    }
                    errno = __save_errno;
                    __ret;
            })
    
    Replace occurences of RET_IF with CHECK. This will abort the test binary
    if clearing the intermediate state fails.

    tun: correct header offsets in napi frags mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 96aa1b22bd6bb9fccf62f6261f390ed6f3e7967f ]
    
    Tun in IFF_NAPI_FRAGS mode calls napi_gro_frags. Unlike netif_rx and
    netif_gro_receive, this expects skb->data to point to the mac layer.
    
    But skb_probe_transport_header, __skb_get_hash_symmetric, and
    xdp_do_generic in tun_get_user need skb->data to point to the network
    header. Flow dissection also needs skb->protocol set, so
    eth_type_trans has to be called.
    
    Ensure the link layer header lies in linear as eth_type_trans pulls
    ETH_HLEN. Then take the same code paths for frags as for not frags.
    Push the link layer header back just before calling napi_gro_frags.
    
    By pulling up to ETH_HLEN from frag0 into linear, this disables the
    frag0 optimization in the special case when IFF_NAPI_FRAGS is used
    with zero length iov[0] (and thus empty skb->linear).

    vxlan: Avoid infinite loop when suppressing NS messages with invalid options

    When proxy mode is enabled the vxlan device might reply to Neighbor
    Solicitation (NS) messages on behalf of remote hosts.
    
    In case the NS message includes the "Source link-layer address" option
    [1], the vxlan device will use the specified address as the link-layer
    destination address in its reply.
    
    To avoid an infinite loop, break out of the options parsing loop when
    encountering an option with length zero and disregard the NS message.
    
    This is consistent with the IPv6 ndisc code and RFC 4886 which states

    with length zero" [2].

    ipv6: fix IPV6_ADDRFORM operation logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 79a1f0ccdbb4ad700590f61b00525b390cb53905 ]
    
    Socket option IPV6_ADDRFORM supports UDP/UDPLITE and TCP at present.
    Previously the checking logic looks like:
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDP || sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDPLITE)
            do_some_check;
    else if (sk->sk_protocol != IPPROTO_TCP)
            break;
    
    After commit b6f6118901d1 ("ipv6: restrict IPV6_ADDRFORM operation"), TCP
    was blocked as the logic changed to:
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDP || sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDPLITE)
            do_some_check;
    else if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_TCP)
            do_some_check;
            break;
    else
            break;
    
    Then after commit 82c9ae440857 ("ipv6: fix restrict IPV6_ADDRFORM operation")
    UDP/UDPLITE were blocked as the logic changed to:
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDP || sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDPLITE)
            do_some_check;
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_TCP)
            do_some_check;
    
    if (sk->sk_protocol != IPPROTO_TCP)
            break;
    
    Fix it by using Eric's code and simply remove the break in TCP check, which
    looks like:
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDP || sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDPLITE)
            do_some_check;
    else if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_TCP)
            do_some_check;
    else
