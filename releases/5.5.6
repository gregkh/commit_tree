    bcache: properly initialize 'path' and 'err' in register_bcache()
    
    [ Upstream commit 29cda393bcaad160c4bf3676ddd99855adafc72f ]
    
    Patch "bcache: rework error unwinding in register_bcache" from
    Christoph Hellwig changes the local variables 'path' and 'err'
    in undefined initial state. If the code in register_bcache() jumps
    to label 'out:' or 'out_module_put:' by goto, these two variables
    might be reference with undefined value by the following line,
    
            out_module_put:
                    module_put(THIS_MODULE);
            out:
                    pr_info("error %s: %s", path, err);
                    return ret;
    
    Therefore this patch initializes these two local variables properly
    in register_bcache() to avoid such issue.

    s390/pci: Recover handle in clp_set_pci_fn()
    
    [ Upstream commit 17cdec960cf776b20b1fb08c622221babe591d51 ]
    
    When we try to recover a PCI function using
    
        echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<id>/recover
    
    or manually with
    
        echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<id>/remove
        echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/slots/<slot>/power
        echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/slots/<slot>/power
    
    clp_disable_fn() / clp_enable_fn() call clp_set_pci_fn() to first
    disable and then reenable the function.
    
    When the function is already in the requested state we may be left with
    an invalid function handle.
    
    To get a new valid handle we do a clp_list_pci() call. For this we need
    both the function ID and function handle in clp_set_pci_fn() so pass the
    zdev and get both.
    
    To simplify things also pull setting the refreshed function handle into
    clp_set_pci_fn()

    mlxsw: core: Add validation of hardware device types for MGPIR register
    
    [ Upstream commit 36844c855b896f90bab51ccecf72940eb7e3cfe1 ]
    
    When reading the number of gearboxes from the hardware, the driver does
    not validate the returned 'device type' field. The driver can therefore
    wrongly assume that the queried devices are gearboxes.
    
    On Spectrum-3 systems that support different types of devices, this can
    prevent the driver from loading, as it will try to query the
    temperature sensors from devices which it assumes are gearboxes and in
    fact are not.
    
    For example:
    [  218.129230] mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Reg cmd access status failed (status=7(bad parameter))
    [  218.138282] mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Reg cmd access failed (reg_id=900a(mtmp),type=write)
    [  218.147131] mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Failed to setup temp sensor number 256
    [  218.534480] mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Fail to register core bus
    [  218.540714] mlxsw_minimal: probe of 2-0048 failed with error -5
    
    Fix this by validating the 'device type' field.

    NFS: Fix memory leaks
    
    [ Upstream commit 123c23c6a7b7ecd2a3d6060bea1d94019f71fd66 ]
    
    In _nfs42_proc_copy(), 'res->commit_res.verf' is allocated through
    kzalloc() if 'args->sync' is true. In the following code, if
    'res->synchronous' is false, handle_async_copy() will be invoked. If an
    error occurs during the invocation, the following code will not be executed
    and the error will be returned . However, the allocated
    'res->commit_res.verf' is not deallocated, leading to a memory leak. This
    is also true if the invocation of process_copy_commit() returns an error.
    
    To fix the above leaks, redirect the execution to the 'out' label if an
    error is encountered.

    In brd_init func, rd_nr num of brd_device are firstly allocated
    and add in brd_devices, then brd_devices are traversed to add each
    brd_device by calling add_disk func. When allocating brd_device,
    the disk->first_minor is set to i * max_part, if rd_nr * max_part
    is larger than MINORMASK, two different brd_device may have the same
    devt, then only one of them can be successfully added.
    when rmmod brd.ko, it will cause oops when calling brd_exit.
    
    Follow those steps:
      # modprobe brd rd_nr=3 rd_size=102400 max_part=1048576
      # rmmod brd
    then, the oops will appear.

    iwlwifi: mvm: Check the sta is not NULL in iwl_mvm_cfg_he_sta()
    
    [ Upstream commit 12d47f0ea5e0aa63f19ba618da55a7c67850ca10 ]
    
    Fix a kernel panic by checking that the sta is not NULL.
    This could happen during a reconfig flow, as mac80211 moves the sta
    between all the states without really checking if the previous state was
    successfully set. So, if for some reason we failed to add back the
    station, subsequent calls to sta_state() callback will be done when the
    station is NULL. This would result in a following panic:

    nvme-pci: remove nvmeq->tags
    
    [ Upstream commit cfa27356f835dc7755192e7b941d4f4851acbcc7 ]
    
    There is no real need to have a pointer to the tagset in
    struct nvme_queue, as we only need it in a single place, and that place
    can derive the used tagset from the device and qid trivially.  This
    fixes a problem with stale pointer exposure when tagsets are reset,
    and also shrinks the nvme_queue structure.  It also matches what most
    other transports have done since day 1.

    ctrl->subsys->namespaces and subsys->namespaces are traversed with
    list_for_each_entry_rcu outside an RCU read-side critical section but
    under the protection of ctrl->subsys->lock and subsys->lock respectively.
    
    Hence, add the corresponding lockdep expression to the list traversal
    primitive to silence false-positive lockdep warnings, and harden RCU
    lists.

    It looks like an obvious mistake to use its_mapc_cmd descriptor when
    building the INVALL command block. It so far worked by luck because
    both its_mapc_cmd.col and its_invall_cmd.col sit at the same offset of
    the ITS command descriptor, but we should not rely on it.

    [ Upstream commit d1c3cc34f5a78b38d2b809b289d912c3560545df ]

    As the warning information indicates, local varaible ref_nr in unsigned
    int type is wrong, which does not matche atomic_read() and the "<= 0"
    checking.
    
    This patch fixes the above error by defining local variable ref_nr as
    int type.

    bcache: explicity type cast in bset_bkey_last()
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c02b0055f774ed9afb6e1c7724f33bf148ffdc0 ]
    
    In bset.h, macro bset_bkey_last() is defined as,
        bkey_idx((struct bkey *) (i)->d, (i)->keys)
    
    Parameter i can be variable type of data structure, the macro always
    works once the type of struct i has member 'd' and 'keys'.
    
    bset_bkey_last() is also used in macro csum_set() to calculate the
    checksum of a on-disk data structure. When csum_set() is used to
    calculate checksum of on-disk bcache super block, the parameter 'i'
    data type is struct cache_sb_disk. Inside struct cache_sb_disk (also in
    struct cache_sb) the member keys is __u16 type. But bkey_idx() expects
    unsigned int (a 32bit width), so there is problem when sending
    parameters via stack to call bkey_idx().
    
    Sparse tool from Intel 0day kbuild system reports this incompatible
    problem. bkey_idx() is part of user space API, so the simplest fix is
    to cast the (i)->keys to unsigned int type in macro bset_bkey_last().

    bcache: fix memory corruption in bch_cache_accounting_clear()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5bebf7486d4f4940b2a8e4009beb1dff5041853d ]
    
    Commit 83ff9318c44ba ("bcache: not use hard coded memset size in
    bch_cache_accounting_clear()") tries to make the code more easy to
    understand by removing the hard coded number with following change,
            void bch_cache_accounting_clear(...)
            {
                    memset(&acc->total.cache_hits,
                            0,
            -               sizeof(unsigned long) * 7);
            +               sizeof(struct cache_stats));
            }
    
    Unfortunately the change was wrong (it also tells us the original code
    was not easy to correctly understand). The hard coded number 7 is used
    because in struct cache_stats,
     15 struct cache_stats {
     16         struct kobject          kobj;
     17
     18         unsigned long cache_hits;
     19         unsigned long cache_misses;
     20         unsigned long cache_bypass_hits;
     21         unsigned long cache_bypass_misses;
     22         unsigned long cache_readaheads;
     23         unsigned long cache_miss_collisions;
     24         unsigned long sectors_bypassed;
     25
     26         unsigned int            rescale;
     27 };
    only members in LINE 18-24 want to be set to 0. It is wrong to use
    'sizeof(struct cache_stats)' to replace 'sizeof(unsigned long) * 7), the
    memory objects behind acc->total is staled by this change.
    
    Сорокин Артем Сергеевич reports that by the following steps, kernel
    panic will be triggered,
    1. Create new set: make-bcache -B /dev/nvme1n1 -C /dev/sda --wipe-bcache
    2. Run in /sys/fs/bcache/<uuid>:
       echo 1 > clear_stats && cat stats_five_minute/cache_bypass_hits
    
    I can reproduce the panic and get following dmesg with KASAN enabled,

    reiserfs: prevent NULL pointer dereference in reiserfs_insert_item()
    
    [ Upstream commit aacee5446a2a1aa35d0a49dab289552578657fb4 ]
    
    The variable inode may be NULL in reiserfs_insert_item(), but there is
    no check before accessing the member of inode.
    
    Fix this by adding NULL pointer check before calling reiserfs_debug().

    [ Upstream commit 4e456fee215677584cafa7f67298a76917e89c64 ]
    
    Clang warns:

      is not part of the previous 'if' [-Wmisleading-indentation]

      1 warning generated.
    
    This warning occurs because there is a space before the tab on this
    line.  Remove it so that the indentation is consistent with the Linux
    kernel coding style and clang no longer warns.

    ocfs2: make local header paths relative to C files
    
    [ Upstream commit ca322fb6030956c2337fbf1c1beeb08c5dd5c943 ]
    
    Gang He reports the failure of building fs/ocfs2/ as an external module
    of the kernel installed on the system:
    
     $ cd fs/ocfs2
     $ make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=`pwd` modules
    
    If you want to make it work reliably, I'd recommend to remove ccflags-y
    from the Makefiles, and to make header paths relative to the C files.  I
    think this is the correct usage of the #include "..." directive.

    tracing: Fix now invalid var_ref_vals assumption in trace action
    
    [ Upstream commit d380dcde9a07ca5de4805dee11f58a98ec0ad6ff ]
    
    The patch 'tracing: Fix histogram code when expression has same var as
    value' added code to return an existing variable reference when
    creating a new variable reference, which resulted in var_ref_vals
    slots being reused instead of being duplicated.
    
    The implementation of the trace action assumes that the end of the
    var_ref_vals array starting at action_data.var_ref_idx corresponds to
    the values that will be assigned to the trace params. The patch
    mentioned above invalidates that assumption, which means that each
    param needs to explicitly specify its index into var_ref_vals.
    
    This fix changes action_data.var_ref_idx to an array of var ref
    indexes to account for that.

    btrfs: do not do delalloc reservation under page lock

    Thankfully the stars have to align just right to hit this.  First you
    have to end up in the fixup worker, which is tricky by itself (my
    reproducer does DIO reads into a MMAP'ed region, so not a common
    operation).  Then you have to have less than a page size of free data
    space and 0 unallocated space so you go down the "commit the transaction
    to free up pinned space" path.  This was accomplished by a random
    balance that was running on the host.  Then you get this deadlock.
    
    I'm still in the process of trying to force the deadlock to happen on
    demand, but I've hit other issues.  I can still trigger the fixup worker
    path itself so this patch has been tested in that regard, so the normal
    case is fine.

    powerpc: Do not consider weak unresolved symbol relocations as bad
    
    [ Upstream commit 43e76cd368fbb67e767da5363ffeaa3989993c8c ]
    
    Commit 8580ac9404f6 ("bpf: Process in-kernel BTF") introduced two weak
    symbols that may be unresolved at link time which result in an absolute
    relocation to 0. relocs_check.sh emits the following warning:
    
    "WARNING: 2 bad relocations
    c000000001a41478 R_PPC64_ADDR64    _binary__btf_vmlinux_bin_start
    c000000001a41480 R_PPC64_ADDR64    _binary__btf_vmlinux_bin_end"
    
    whereas those relocations are legitimate even for a relocatable kernel
    compiled with -pie option.
    
    relocs_check.sh already excluded some weak unresolved symbols explicitly:
    remove those hardcoded symbols and add some logic that parses the symbols
    using nm, retrieves all the weak unresolved symbols and excludes those from
    the list of the potential bad relocations.

    char: hpet: Fix out-of-bounds read bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 98c49f1746ac44ccc164e914b9a44183fad09f51 ]
    
    Currently, there is an out-of-bounds read on array hpetp->hp_dev
    in the following for loop:
    
    870         for (i = 0; i < hdp->hd_nirqs; i++)
    871                 hpetp->hp_dev[i].hd_hdwirq = hdp->hd_irq[i];
    
    This is due to the recent change from one-element array to
    flexible-array member in struct hpets:
    
    104 struct hpets {
            ...
    113         struct hpet_dev hp_dev[];
    114 };
    
    This change affected the total size of the dynamic memory
    allocation, decreasing it by one time the size of struct hpet_dev.
    
    Fix this by adjusting the allocation size when calling
    struct_size().

    The implementations for most channel types contains a map of methods to

    has been raised.
    
    This info is missing from the implementation of PIO channels as they're

    them, we'd end up triggering a NULL-pointer deref.  Not ideal...

    irqchip/gic-v3: Only provision redistributors that are enabled in ACPI
    
    [ Upstream commit 926b5dfa6b8dc666ff398044af6906b156e1d949 ]
    
    We currently allocate redistributor region structures for
    individual redistributors when ACPI doesn't present us with
    compact MMIO regions covering multiple redistributors.
    
    It turns out that we allocate these structures even when
    the redistributor is flagged as disabled by ACPI. It works
    fine until someone actually tries to tarse one of these
    structures, and access the corresponding MMIO region.
    
    Instead, track the number of enabled redistributors, and
    only allocate what is required. This makes sure that there
    is no invalid data to misuse.

    ASoC: Intel: consistent HDMI codec probing code
    
    [ Upstream commit 98ff5c262f27aafee077a4c096f71a8566e9e948 ]
    
    Multiple Intel ASoC machine drivers repeat the same pattern in their
    .late_probe() methods: they first check whether the common HDMI codec
    driver is used, if not, they proceed by linking the legacy HDMI
    driver to each HDMI port. While doing that they use some
    inconsistent code:
    
    1. after the loop they check, whether the list contained at least one
       element and if not, they return an error. However, the earlier
       code to use the common HDMI driver uses the first element of the
       same list without checking. To fix this we move the check to the
       top of the function.
    
    2. some of those .late_probe() implementations execute code, only
       needed for the common HDMI driver, before checking, whether the
       driver is used. Move the code to after the check.
    
    3. Some of those functions also perform a redundant initialisation of
       the "err" variable.
    
    This patch fixes those issues.

    powerpc/mm: Don't log user reads to 0xffffffff

    A pointer set to (-1) is likely a programming error similar to

    video: hyperv: hyperv_fb: Use physical memory for fb on HyperV Gen 1 VMs.
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a6fb6c4255c3893ab61e2bd4e9ae01ca6bbcd94 ]
    
    On Hyper-V, Generation 1 VMs can directly use VM's physical memory for
    their framebuffers. This can improve the efficiency of framebuffer and
    overall performence for VM. The physical memory assigned to framebuffer
    must be contiguous. We use CMA allocator to get contiguouse physicial
    memory when the framebuffer size is greater than 4MB. For size under
    4MB, we use alloc_pages to achieve this.
    
    To enable framebuffer memory allocation from CMA, supply a kernel
    parameter to give enough space to CMA allocator at boot time. For
    example:
        cma=130m
    This gives 130MB memory to CAM allocator that can be allocated to
    framebuffer. If this fails, we fall back to the old way of using
    mmio for framebuffer.

    ARM: 8941/1: decompressor: enable CP15 barrier instructions in v7 cache setup code
    
    [ Upstream commit 8239fc7755fd3d410920006615abd0c7d653560f ]
    
    Commit e17b1af96b2afc38e684aa2f1033387e2ed10029
    
      "ARM: 8857/1: efi: enable CP15 DMB instructions before cleaning the cache"
    
    added some explicit handling of the CP15BEN bit in the SCTLR system
    register, to ensure that CP15 barrier instructions are enabled, even
    if we enter the decompressor via the EFI stub.
    
    However, as it turns out, there are other ways in which we may end up
    using CP15 barrier instructions without them being enabled. I.e., when
    the decompressor startup code skips the cache_on() initially, we end
    up calling cache_clean_flush() with the caches and MMU off, in which
    case the CP15BEN bit in SCTLR may not be programmed either. And in
    fact, cache_on() itself issues CP15 barrier instructions before actually
    enabling them by programming the new SCTLR value (and issuing an ISB)
    
    Since these routines are shared between v7 CPUs and older ones that
    implement the CPUID extension as well, using the ordinary v7 barrier
    instructions in this code is not possible, and so we should enable the
    CP15 ones explicitly before issuing them. Note that a v7 ISB is still
    required between programming the SCTLR register and using the CP15 barrier
    instructions, and we should take care to branch over it if the CP15BEN
    bit is already set, given that in that case, the CPU may not support it.

    alarmtimer: Make alarmtimer platform device child of RTC device
    
    [ Upstream commit c79108bd19a8490315847e0c95ac6526fcd8e770 ]
    
    The alarmtimer_suspend() function will fail if an RTC device is on a bus
    such as SPI or i2c and that RTC device registers and probes after
    alarmtimer_init() registers and probes the 'alarmtimer' platform device.
    
    This is because system wide suspend suspends devices in the reverse order
    of their probe. When alarmtimer_suspend() attempts to program the RTC for a
    wakeup it will try to program an RTC device on a bus that has already been
    suspended.
    
    Move the alarmtimer device registration to happen when the RTC which is
    used for wakeup is registered. Register the 'alarmtimer' platform device as
    a child of the RTC device too, so that it can be guaranteed that the RTC
    device won't be suspended when alarmtimer_suspend() is called.

    iommu/vt-d: Remove unnecessary WARN_ON_ONCE()
    
    [ Upstream commit 857f081426e5aa38313426c13373730f1345fe95 ]
    
    Address field in device TLB invalidation descriptor is qualified
    by the S field. If S field is zero, a single page at page address
    specified by address [63:12] is requested to be invalidated. If S
    field is set, the least significant bit in the address field with
    value 0b (say bit N) indicates the invalidation address range. The
    spec doesn't require the address [N - 1, 0] to be cleared, hence
    remove the unnecessary WARN_ON_ONCE().
    
    Otherwise, the caller might set "mask = MAX_AGAW_PFN_WIDTH" in order
    to invalidating all the cached mappings on an endpoint, and below
    overflow error will be triggered.

    iommu/vt-d: Mark firmware tainted if RMRR fails sanity check
    
    [ Upstream commit f5a68bb0752e0cf77c06f53f72258e7beb41381b ]
    
    RMRR entries describe memory regions that are DMA targets for devices
    outside the kernel's control.
    
    RMRR entries that fail the sanity check are pointing to regions of
    memory that the firmware did not tell the kernel are reserved or
    otherwise should not be used.
    
    Instead of aborting DMAR processing, this commit marks the firmware
    as tainted. These RMRRs will still be identity mapped, otherwise,
    some devices, e.x. graphic devices, will not work during boot.

    bcache: fix use-after-free in register_bcache()
    
    [ Upstream commit ae3cd299919af6eb670d5af0bc9d7ba14086bd8e ]
    
    The patch "bcache: rework error unwinding in register_bcache" introduces
    a use-after-free regression in register_bcache(). Here are current code,
            2510 out_free_path:
            2511         kfree(path);
            2512 out_module_put:
            2513         module_put(THIS_MODULE);
            2514 out:
            2515         pr_info("error %s: %s", path, err);
            2516         return ret;
    If some error happens and the above code path is executed, at line 2511
    path is released, but referenced at line 2515. Then KASAN reports a use-
    after-free error message.
    
    This patch changes line 2515 in the following way to fix the problem,
            2515         pr_info("error %s: %s", path?path:"", err);

    Split the successful and error return path, and use one goto label for each
    resource to unwind.  This also fixes some small errors like leaking the
    module reference count in the reboot case (which seems entirely harmless)
    or printing the wrong warning messages for early failures.

    btrfs: Fix split-brain handling when changing FSID to metadata uuid
    
    [ Upstream commit 1362089d2ad7e20d16371b39d3c11990d4ec23e4 ]
    
    Current code doesn't correctly handle the situation which arises when
    a file system that has METADATA_UUID_INCOMPAT flag set and has its FSID
    changed to the one in metadata uuid. This causes the incompat flag to
    disappear.
    
    In case of a power failure we could end up in a situation where part of
    the disks in a multi-disk filesystem are correctly reverted to
    METADATA_UUID_INCOMPAT flag unset state, while others have
    METADATA_UUID_INCOMPAT set and CHANGING_FSID_V2_IN_PROGRESS.
    
    This patch corrects the behavior required to handle the case where a
    disk of the second type is scanned first, creating the necessary
    btrfs_fs_devices. Subsequently, when a disk which has already completed
    the transition is scanned it should overwrite the data in
    btrfs_fs_devices.

    btrfs: separate definition of assertion failure handlers
    
    [ Upstream commit 68c467cbb2f389b6c933e235bce0d1756fc8cc34 ]
    
    There's a report where objtool detects unreachable instructions, eg.:
    
      fs/btrfs/ctree.o: warning: objtool: btrfs_search_slot()+0x2d4: unreachable instruction
    
    This seems to be a false positive due to compiler version. The cause is
    in the ASSERT macro implementation that does the conditional check as
    IS_DEFINED(CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT) and not an #ifdef.
    
    To avoid that, use the ifdefs directly.
    
    There are still 2 reports that aren't fixed:
    
      fs/btrfs/extent_io.o: warning: objtool: __set_extent_bit()+0x71f: unreachable instruction
      fs/btrfs/relocation.o: warning: objtool: find_data_references()+0x4e0: unreachable instruction

    powerpc/sriov: Remove VF eeh_dev state when disabling SR-IOV
    
    [ Upstream commit 1fb4124ca9d456656a324f1ee29b7bf942f59ac8 ]
    
    When disabling virtual functions on an SR-IOV adapter we currently do not
    correctly remove the EEH state for the now-dead virtual functions. When
    removing the pci_dn that was created for the VF when SR-IOV was enabled
    we free the corresponding eeh_dev without removing it from the child device
    list of the eeh_pe that contained it. This can result in crashes due to the
    use-after-free.

    75b8:       e3 f0 ff a8 ff 71       lay     %r15,-88(%r15)
    
    So the BUG() is actually the last opcode of the previous function.
    Fix this by switching to using the MONITOR CALL (MC) instruction,
    and set the entry in __bug_table to the beginning of that MC.

    "ftrace_caller" itself is called without stack frame allocated for it
    and does not store its caller (ftraced function). Instead it simply
    allocates a stack frame for "ftrace_trace_function" and sets backchain
    to point to ftraced function stack frame (which contains ftraced function
    caller in saved r14).
    
    To fix this issue make "ftrace_caller" allocate a stack frame
    for itself just to store ftraced function for the stack unwinder.
    As a result backtrace looks like the following:

    stack_trace_save+0x50/0x68

    s390: adjust -mpacked-stack support check for clang 10
    
    [ Upstream commit 253b3c4b2920e07ce9e2b18800b9b65245e2fafa ]
    
    clang 10 introduces -mpacked-stack compiler option implementation. At the
    same time currently it does not support a combination of -mpacked-stack
    and -mbackchain. This leads to the following build error:
    
    clang: error: unsupported option '-mpacked-stack with -mbackchain' for
    target 's390x-ibm-linux'
    
    If/when clang adds support for a combination of -mpacked-stack and
    -mbackchain it would also require -msoft-float (like gcc does). According
    to Ulrich Weigand "stack slot assigned to the kernel backchain overlaps
    the stack slot assigned to the FPR varargs (both are required to be
    placed immediately after the saved r15 slot if present)."
    
    Extend -mpacked-stack compiler option support check to include all 3
    options -mpacked-stack -mbackchain -msoft-float which must present to
    support -mpacked-stack with -mbackchain.

    x86/decoder: Add TEST opcode to Group3-2
    
    [ Upstream commit 8b7e20a7ba54836076ff35a28349dabea4cec48f ]
    
    Add TEST opcode to Group3-2 reg=001b as same as Group3-1 does.
    
    Commit
    
      12a78d43de76 ("x86/decoder: Add new TEST instruction pattern")
    
    added a TEST opcode assignment to f6 XX/001/XXX (Group 3-1), but did
    not add f7 XX/001/XXX (Group 3-2).
    
    Actually, this TEST opcode variant (ModRM.reg /1) is not described in
    the Intel SDM Vol2 but in AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual Vol.3,
    Appendix A.2 Table A-6. ModRM.reg Extensions for the Primary Opcode Map.
    
    Without this fix, Randy found a warning by insn_decoder_test related
    to this issue as below.

    kbuild: use -S instead of -E for precise cc-option test in Kconfig
    
    [ Upstream commit 3bed1b7b9d79ca40e41e3af130931a3225e951a3 ]
    
    Currently, -E (stop after the preprocessing stage) is used to check
    whether the given compiler flag is supported.
    
    While it is faster than -S (or -c), it can be false-positive. You need
    to run the compilation proper to check the flag more precisely.
    
    For example, -E and -S disagree about the support of
    "--param asan-instrument-allocas=1".
    
    $ gcc -Werror --param asan-instrument-allocas=1 -E -x c /dev/null -o /dev/null
    $ echo $?
    0
    
    $ gcc -Werror --param asan-instrument-allocas=1 -S -x c /dev/null -o /dev/null
    cc1: error: invalid --param name ‘asan-instrument-allocas’; did you mean ‘asan-instrument-writes’?

    Make use of a core helper to ensure the desired width is respected
    when calling spi-mem operators.
    
    Otherwise only the SPI controller will be matched with the flash chip,
    which might lead to wrong widths. Also consider the width specified by
    the user in the device tree.

    ALSA: hda/hdmi - add retry logic to parse_intel_hdmi()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2928fa0a97ebb9549cb877fdc99aed9b95438c3a ]
    
    The initial snd_hda_get_sub_node() can fail on certain
    devices (e.g. some Chromebook models using Intel GLK).
    The failure rate is very low, but as this is is part of
    the probe process, end-user impact is high.
    
    In observed cases, related hardware status registers have
    expected values, but the node query still fails. Retrying
    the node query does seem to help, so fix the problem by
    adding retry logic to the query. This does not impact
    non-Intel platforms.

    The specific problem here is that the mbigen driver real probe has failed
    as the mbigen_of_create_domain()->of_platform_device_create() call fails,
    the reason for that being that we never destroyed the platform device
    created during the remove test dry run and there is some conflict.
    
    Since we generally would never want to unbind this driver, and to save
    adding a driver tear down path for that, just set the driver
    .suppress_bind_attrs member to avoid this possibility.

    remoteproc: Initialize rproc_class before use
    
    [ Upstream commit a8f40111d184098cd2b3dc0c7170c42250a5fa09 ]
    
    The remoteproc_core and remoteproc drivers all initialize with module_init().
    However remoteproc drivers need the rproc_class during their probe. If one of
    the remoteproc drivers runs init and gets through probe before
    remoteproc_init() runs, a NULL pointer access of rproc_class's `glue_dirs`
    spinlock occurs.

    module: avoid setting info->name early in case we can fall back to info->mod->name

    In setup_load_info(), info->name (which contains the name of the module,
    mostly used for early logging purposes before the module gets set up)
    gets unconditionally assigned if .modinfo is missing despite the fact
    that there is an if (!info->name) check near the end of the function.
    Avoid assigning a placeholder string to info->name if .modinfo doesn't
    exist, so that we can fall back to info->mod->name later on.

    [ Upstream commit a69976bc69308aa475d0ba3b8b3efd1d013c0460 ]
    
    We had a report indicating that some read errors aren't reported by the
    device stats in the userland. It is important to have the errors
    reported in the device stat as user land scripts might depend on it to
    take the reasonable corrective actions. But to debug these issue we need
    to be really sure that request to reset the device stat did not come
    from the userland itself. So log an info message when device error reset
    happens.
    
    For example:

    btrfs: safely advance counter when looking up bio csums
    
    [ Upstream commit 4babad10198fa73fe73239d02c2e99e3333f5f5c ]
    
    Dan's smatch tool reports
    
      fs/btrfs/file-item.c:295 btrfs_lookup_bio_sums()
      warn: should this be 'count == -1'
    
    which points to the while (count--) loop. With count == 0 the check
    itself could decrement it to -1. There's a WARN_ON a few lines below
    that has never been seen in practice though.
    
    It turns out that the value of page_bytes_left matches the count (by
    sectorsize multiples). The loop never reaches the state where count
    would go to -1, because page_bytes_left == 0 is found first and this
    breaks out.
    
    For clarity, use only plain check on count (and only for positive
    value), decrement safely inside the loop. Any other discrepancy after
    the whole bio list processing should be reported by the exising
    WARN_ON_ONCE as well.

    A user reports a possible NULL-pointer dereference in

    argument for btrfs_num_copies(). There we can just pass in
    state->fs_info as well.

    x86/boot/compressed: Relax sed symbol type regex for LLVM ld.lld
    
    [ Upstream commit bc310baf2ba381c648983c7f4748327f17324562 ]
    
    The final build stage of the x86 kernel captures some symbol
    addresses from the decompressor binary and copies them into zoffset.h.
    It uses sed with a regular expression that matches the address, symbol
    type and symbol name, and mangles the captured addresses and the names
    of symbols of interest into #define directives that are added to
    zoffset.h
    
    The symbol type is indicated by a single letter, which we match
    strictly: only letters in the set 'ABCDGRSTVW' are matched, even
    though the actual symbol type is relevant and therefore ignored.
    
    Commit bc7c9d620 ("efi/libstub/x86: Force 'hidden' visibility for
    extern declarations") made a change to the way external symbol
    references are classified, resulting in 'startup_32' now being
    emitted as a hidden symbol. This prevents the use of GOT entries to
    refer to this symbol via its absolute address, which recent toolchains
    (including Clang based ones) already avoid by default, making this
    change a no-op in the majority of cases.
    
    However, as it turns out, the LLVM linker classifies such hidden
    symbols as symbols with static linkage in fully linked ELF binaries,
    causing tools such as NM to output a lowercase 't' rather than an upper
    case 'T' for the type of such symbols. Since our sed expression only
    matches upper case letters for the symbol type, the line describing
    startup_32 is disregarded, resulting in a build error like the following
    
      arch/x86/boot/header.S:568:18: error: symbol 'ZO_startup_32' can not be
                                            undefined in a subtraction expression
      init_size: .long (0x00000000008fd000 - ZO_startup_32 +
                        (((0x0000000001f6361c + ((0x0000000001f6361c >> 8) + 65536)
                         - 0x00000000008c32e5) + 4095) & ~4095)) # kernel initialization size
    
    Given that we are only interested in the value of the symbol, let's match
    any character in the set 'a-zA-Z' instead.

    efi/arm: Defer probe of PCIe backed efifb on DT systems
    
    [ Upstream commit 64c8a0cd0a535891d5905c3a1651150f0f141439 ]
    
    The new of_devlink support breaks PCIe probing on ARM platforms booting
    via UEFI if the firmware exposes a EFI framebuffer that is backed by a
    PCI device. The reason is that the probing order gets reversed,
    resulting in a resource conflict on the framebuffer memory window when
    the PCIe probes last, causing it to give up entirely.
    
    Given that we rely on PCI quirks to deal with EFI framebuffers that get
    moved around in memory, we cannot simply drop the memory reservation, so
    instead, let's use the device link infrastructure to register this
    dependency, and force the probing to occur in the expected order.

    x86/mm: Fix NX bit clearing issue in kernel_map_pages_in_pgd

    The following commit:
    
      15f003d20782 ("x86/mm/pat: Don't implicitly allow _PAGE_RW in kernel_map_pages_in_pgd()")
    
    modified kernel_map_pages_in_pgd() to manage writable permissions
    of memory mappings in the EFI page table in a different way, but
    in the process, it removed the ability to clear NX attributes from
    read-only mappings, by clobbering the clear mask if _PAGE_RW is not
    being requested.
    
    Failure to remove the NX attribute from read-only mappings is
    unlikely to be a security issue, but it does prevent us from
    tightening the permissions in the EFI page tables going forward,
    so let's fix it now.

    regulator: vctrl-regulator: Avoid deadlock getting and setting the voltage
    
    [ Upstream commit e9153311491da9d9863ead9888a1613531cb4a1b ]
    
    `cat /sys/kernel/debug/regulator/regulator_summary` ends on a deadlock
    when you have a voltage controlled regulator (vctrl).
    
    The problem is that the vctrl_get_voltage() and vctrl_set_voltage() calls the
    regulator_get_voltage() and regulator_set_voltage() and that will try to lock
    again the dependent regulators (the regulator supplying the control voltage).
    
    Fix the issue by exporting the unlocked version of the regulator_get_voltage()
    and regulator_set_voltage() API so drivers that need it, like the voltage
    controlled regulator driver can use it.

    debugobjects: Fix various data races
    
    [ Upstream commit 35fd7a637c42bb54ba4608f4d40ae6e55fc88781 ]
    
    The counters obj_pool_free, and obj_nr_tofree, and the flag obj_freeing are
    read locklessly outside the pool_lock critical sections. If read with plain
    accesses, this would result in data races.
    
    This is addressed as follows:
    
     * reads outside critical sections become READ_ONCE()s (pairing with
       WRITE_ONCE()s added);
    
     * writes become WRITE_ONCE()s (pairing with READ_ONCE()s added); since

    watchdog/softlockup: Enforce that timestamp is valid on boot
    
    [ Upstream commit 11e31f608b499f044f24b20be73f1dcab3e43f8a ]
    
    Robert reported that during boot the watchdog timestamp is set to 0 for one
    second which is the indicator for a watchdog reset.
    
    The reason for this is that the timestamp is in seconds and the time is
    taken from sched clock and divided by ~1e9. sched clock starts at 0 which
    means that for the first second during boot the watchdog timestamp is 0,
    i.e. reset.
    
    Use ULONG_MAX as the reset indicator value so the watchdog works correctly
    right from the start. ULONG_MAX would only conflict with a real timestamp
    if the system reaches an uptime of 136 years on 32bit and almost eternity
    on 64bit.

    perf/x86/amd: Constrain Large Increment per Cycle events
    
    [ Upstream commit 471af006a747f1c535c8a8c6c0973c320fe01b22 ]
    
    AMD Family 17h processors and above gain support for Large Increment
    per Cycle events.  Unfortunately there is no CPUID or equivalent bit
    that indicates whether the feature exists or not, so we continue to
    determine eligibility based on a CPU family number comparison.
    
    For Large Increment per Cycle events, we add a f17h-and-compatibles
    get_event_constraints_f17h() that returns an even counter bitmask:
    Large Increment per Cycle events can only be placed on PMCs 0, 2,
    and 4 out of the currently available 0-5.  The only currently
    public event that requires this feature to report valid counts
    is PMCx003 "Retired SSE/AVX Operations".
    
    Note that the CPU family logic in amd_core_pmu_init() is changed
    so as to be able to selectively add initialization for features
    available in ranges of backward-compatible CPU families.  This
    Large Increment per Cycle feature is expected to be retained
    in future families.
    
    A side-effect of assigning a new get_constraints function for f17h
    disables calling the old (prior to f15h) amd_get_event_constraints
    implementation left enabled by commit e40ed1542dd7 ("perf/x86: Add perf
    support for AMD family-17h processors"), which is no longer
    necessary since those North Bridge event codes are obsoleted.
    
    Also fix a spelling mistake whilst in the area (calulating ->
    calculating).

    sched/topology: Assert non-NUMA topology masks don't (partially) overlap
    
    [ Upstream commit ccf74128d66ce937876184ad55db2e0276af08d3 ]
    
    topology.c::get_group() relies on the assumption that non-NUMA domains do
    not partially overlap. Zeng Tao pointed out in [1] that such topology
    descriptions, while completely bogus, can end up being exposed to the
    scheduler.
    
    In his example (8 CPUs, 2-node system), we end up with:
      MC span for CPU3 == 3-7
      MC span for CPU4 == 4-7
    
    The first pass through get_group(3, sdd@MC) will result in the following
    sched_group list:
    
      3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7
      ^                  /
       `----------------'
    
    And a later pass through get_group(4, sdd@MC) will "corrupt" that to:
    
      3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7
           ^             /
            `-----------'
    
    which will completely break things like 'while (sg != sd->groups)' when
    using CPU3's base sched_domain.
    
    There already are some architecture-specific checks in place such as
    x86/kernel/smpboot.c::topology.sane(), but this is something we can detect
    in the core scheduler, so it seems worthwhile to do so.
    
    Warn and abort the construction of the sched domains if such a broken
    topology description is detected. Note that this is somewhat
    expensive (O(t.c²), 't' non-NUMA topology levels and 'c' CPUs) and could be
    gated under SCHED_DEBUG if deemed necessary.
    
    Testing
    =======
    
    Dietmar managed to reproduce this using the following qemu incantation:
    
      $ qemu-system-aarch64 -kernel ./Image -hda ./qemu-image-aarch64.img \
      -append 'root=/dev/vda console=ttyAMA0 loglevel=8 sched_debug' -smp \

      node,cpus=0-2,nodeid=0 -numa node,cpus=3-7,nodeid=1
    
    alongside the following drivers/base/arch_topology.c hack (AIUI wouldn't be
    needed if '-smp cores=X, sockets=Y' would work with qemu):

    [ Upstream commit c54f90c2627cc316d365e3073614731e17dbc631 ]
    
    LLVM's integrated assembler fails with the following error when

    These errors come from ALTERNATIVE_CB and __ALTERNATIVE_CFG,
    which test for the existence of the callback parameter in inline
    assembly using the following expression:
    
      " .if " __stringify(cb) " == 0\n"
    
    This works with GNU as, but isn't supported by LLVM. This change
    splits __ALTERNATIVE_CFG and ALTINSTR_ENTRY into separate macros
    to fix the LLVM build.

    any preambles that enable features must be repeated in each block.
    
    This change defines __LSE_PREAMBLE and adds it to each inline assembly
    block that has LSE instructions, which allows them to be compiled also
    with clang's assembler.

    pinctrl: tigerlake: Tiger Lake uses _HID enumeration
    
    [ Upstream commit cd0a32371db73d0b50536a7ca4f036abddff0d1d ]
    
    Turns out that Tiger Lake GPIO will be enumerated using _HID method where
    there is only a single ACPI device and multiple BARs so rework the driver
    to support that scheme instead.

    PM / devfreq: Add debugfs support with devfreq_summary file
    
    [ Upstream commit 490a421bc575d1bf391a6ad5b582dcfbd0037724 ]
    
    Add debugfs interface to provide debugging information of devfreq device.
    It contains 'devfreq_summary' entry to show the summary of registered
    devfreq devices as following and the additional debugfs file will be added.
    - /sys/kernel/debug/devfreq/devfreq_summary
    
    [Detailed description of each field of 'devfreq_summary' debugfs file]
    - dev_name      : Device name of h/w
    - dev           : Device name made by devfreq core
    - parent_dev    : If devfreq device uses the passive governor,
                      show parent devfreq device name. Otherwise, show 'null'.
    - governor      : Devfreq governor name
    - polling_ms    : If devfreq device uses the simple_ondemand governor,
                      polling_ms is necessary for the period. (unit: millisecond)
    - cur_freq_Hz   : Current frequency (unit: Hz)
    - min_freq_Hz   : Minimum frequency (unit: Hz)
    - max_freq_Hz   : Maximum frequency (unit: Hz)
    
    [For example on Exynos5422-based Odroid-XU3 board]
    $ cat /sys/kernel/debug/devfreq/devfreq_summary

    ALSA: usb-audio: add implicit fb quirk for MOTU M Series
    
    [ Upstream commit c249177944b650816069f6c49b769baaa94339dc ]
    
    This fixes crackling sound during playback.
    
    Further note: MOTU is known for reusing Product IDs for different
    devices or different generations of the device (e.g. MicroBook
    I/II/IIc shares a single Product ID). This patch was only tested with
    M4 audio interface, but the same Product ID is also used by M2. Hope
    it will work for M2 as well.

    [ Upstream commit c40ad6b7fcd35bc4d36db820c7737e1aa18d5d41 ]
    
    Pass UFS device information to vendor-specific variant callback
    "apply_dev_quirks" because some platform vendors need to know such
    information to apply special handling or quirks in specific devices.
    
    At the same time, modify existing vendor implementations according to the
    new interface for those vendor drivers which will be built-in or built as a
    module alone with UFS core driver.

    If, for some bizarre reason, the compiler decided to split up the write

    Although this probably won't happen, follow the example of the

    kbuild: remove *.tmp file when filechk fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 88fe89a47153facd8cb2d06d5c8727f7224c43c2 ]
    
    Bartosz Golaszewski reports that when "make {menu,n,g,x}config" fails
    due to missing packages, a temporary file is left over, which is not
    ignored by git.
    
    For example, if GTK+ is not installed:
    
      $ make gconfig
      *
      * Unable to find the GTK+ installation. Please make sure that
      * the GTK+ 2.0 development package is correctly installed.
      * You need gtk+-2.0 gmodule-2.0 libglade-2.0
      *

      nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
    
    This is because the check scripts are run with filechk, which misses
    to clean up the temporary file on failure.
    
    When the line
    
      { $(filechk_$(1)); } > $@.tmp;
    
    ... fails, it exits immediately due to the 'set -e'. Use trap to make
    sure to delete the temporary file on exit.
    
    For extra safety, I replaced $@.tmp with $(dot-target).tmp to make it
    a hidden file.

    usb: musb: omap2430: Get rid of musb .set_vbus for omap2430 glue
    
    [ Upstream commit 91b6dec32e5c25fbdbb564d1e5af23764ec17ef1 ]
    
    We currently have musb_set_vbus() called from two different paths. Mostly
    it gets called from the USB PHY via omap_musb_set_mailbox(), but in some
    cases it can get also called from musb_stage0_irq() rather via .set_vbus:
    
    (musb_set_host [musb_hdrc])
    (omap2430_musb_set_vbus [omap2430])
    (musb_stage0_irq [musb_hdrc])
    (musb_interrupt [musb_hdrc])
    (omap2430_musb_interrupt [omap2430])
    
    This is racy and will not work with introducing generic helper functions
    for musb_set_host() and musb_set_peripheral(). We want to get rid of the
    busy loops in favor of usleep_range().
    
    Let's just get rid of .set_vbus for omap2430 glue layer and let the PHY
    code handle VBUS with musb_set_vbus(). Note that in the follow-up patch
    we can completely remove omap2430_musb_set_vbus(), but let's do it in a
    separate patch as this change may actually turn out to be needed as a
    fix.

    perf/imx_ddr: Fix cpu hotplug state cleanup
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ee68b314e9aa63ed11b98beb8a68810b8234dcf ]
    
    This driver allocates a dynamic cpu hotplug state but never releases it.
    If reloaded in a loop it will quickly trigger a WARN message:
    
            "No more dynamic states available for CPU hotplug"
    
    Fix by calling cpuhp_remove_multi_state on remove like several other
    perf pmu drivers.
    
    Also fix the cleanup logic on probe error paths: add the missing
    cpuhp_remove_multi_state call and properly check the return value from
    cpuhp_state_add_instant_nocalls.

    This is because the msm_gpio_irq_set_wake() function calls
    irq_set_irq_wake() as a backup in case the irq comes in during the path
    to idle. Given that we're calling irqchip functions from within an
    irqchip we need to set the lockdep class to be different for this child
    controller vs. the default one that the parent irqchip gets.
    
    This used to be done before this driver was converted to hierarchical
    irq domains in commit e35a6ae0eb3a ("pinctrl/msm: Setup GPIO chip in
    hierarchy") via the gpiochip_irq_map() function. With hierarchical irq
    domains this function has been replaced by
    gpiochip_hierarchy_irq_domain_alloc(). Therefore, set the lockdep class
    like was done previously in the irq domain path so we can avoid this
    lockdep warning.

    dm thin: don't allow changing data device during thin-pool reload
    
    [ Upstream commit 873937e75f9a8ea231a502c3d29d9cb6ad91b3ef ]
    
    The existing code allows changing the data device when the thin-pool
    target is reloaded.
    
    This capability is not required and only complicates device lifetime
    guarantees. This can cause crashes like the one reported here:
            https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1788596
    where the kernel tries to issue a flush bio located in a structure that
    was already freed.
    
    Take the first step to simplifying the thin-pool's data device lifetime
    by disallowing changing it. Like the thin-pool's metadata device, the
    data device is now set in pool_create() and it cannot be changed for a
    given thin-pool.

    [ Upstream commit e8c192011c920517e5578d51c7aff0ecadd25de3 ]
    
    The radio module asserts CTS when its RX buffer has 10 bytes left.
    Putting just 8 instead of 16 bytes into the UART1 TX buffer on the Linux
    side ensures to not overflow the RX buffer on the radio module side.

    vme: bridges: reduce stack usage
    
    [ Upstream commit 7483e7a939c074d887450ef1c4d9ccc5909405f8 ]
    
    With CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE_O3, the stack usage in vme_fake
    grows above the warning limit:
    
    drivers/vme/bridges/vme_fake.c: In function 'fake_master_read':
    drivers/vme/bridges/vme_fake.c:610:1: error: the frame size of 1160 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
    drivers/vme/bridges/vme_fake.c: In function 'fake_master_write':
    drivers/vme/bridges/vme_fake.c:797:1: error: the frame size of 1160 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
    
    The problem is that in some configurations, each call to
    fake_vmereadX() puts another variable on the stack.
    
    Reduce the amount of inlining to get back to the previous state,
    with no function using more than 200 bytes each.

    bpf: Return -EBADRQC for invalid map type in __bpf_tx_xdp_map
    
    [ Upstream commit 0a29275b6300f39f78a87f2038bbfe5bdbaeca47 ]
    
    A negative value should be returned if map->map_type is invalid
    although that is impossible now, but if we run into such situation
    in future, then xdpbuff could be leaked.
    
    Daniel Borkmann suggested:
    
    -EBADRQC should be returned to stay consistent with generic XDP
    for the tracepoint output and not to be confused with -EOPNOTSUPP
    from other locations like dev_map_enqueue() when ndo_xdp_xmit is
    missing and such.

    driver core: Print device when resources present in really_probe()
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c35e699c88bd60734277b26962783c60e04b494 ]
    
    If a device already has devres items attached before probing, a warning
    backtrace is printed.  However, this backtrace does not reveal the
    offending device, leaving the user uninformed.  Furthermore, using
    WARN_ON() causes systems with panic-on-warn to reboot.
    
    Fix this by replacing the WARN_ON() by a dev_crit() message.
    Abort probing the device, to prevent doing more damage to the device's
    resources.

    The setup_crash_devices_work_queue function only partially initializes
    the message it sends to chipset_init, leading to undefined behavior:
    
    drivers/visorbus/visorchipset.c: In function 'setup_crash_devices_work_queue':

      if (inmsg->hdr.flags.response_expected)
    
    Set up the entire structure, zero-initializing the 'response_expected'
    flag.
    
    This was apparently found by the patch that added the -O3 build option
    in Kconfig.

    Fix this by using the proper return type and using the EPOLL

    ALSA: usb-audio: Add boot quirk for MOTU M Series
    
    [ Upstream commit 73ac9f5e5b43a5dbadb61f27dae7a971f7ec0d22 ]
    
    Add delay to make sure that audio urbs are not sent too early.
    Otherwise the device hangs. Windows driver makes ~2s delay, so use
    about the same time delay value.
    
    snd_usb_apply_boot_quirk() is called 3 times for my MOTU M4, which
    is an overkill. Thus a quirk that is called only once is implemented.
    
    Also send two vendor-specific control messages before and after
    the delay. This behaviour is blindly copied from the Windows driver.

    clocksource: davinci: only enable clockevents once tim34 is initialized
    
    [ Upstream commit cea931c25104e6bddc42eb067f58193f355dbdd7 ]
    
    The DM365 platform has a strange quirk (only present when using ancient
    u-boot - mainline u-boot v2013.01 and later works fine) where if we
    enable the second half of the timer in periodic mode before we do its
    initialization - the time won't start flowing and we can't boot.
    
    When using more recent u-boot, we can enable the timer, then reinitialize
    it and all works fine.
    
    To work around this issue only enable clockevents once tim34 is
    initialized i.e. move clockevents_config_and_register() below tim34
    initialization.

    x86/nmi: Remove irq_work from the long duration NMI handler
    
    [ Upstream commit 248ed51048c40d36728e70914e38bffd7821da57 ]
    
    First, printk() is NMI-context safe now since the safe printk() has been
    implemented and it already has an irq_work to make NMI-context safe.
    
    Second, this NMI irq_work actually does not work if a NMI handler causes
    panic by watchdog timeout. It has no chance to run in such case, while
    the safe printk() will flush its per-cpu buffers before panicking.
    
    While at it, repurpose the irq_work callback into a function which
    concentrates the NMI duration checking and makes the code easier to
    follow.

    [ Upstream commit 3071c51783b39d6a676d02a9256c3b3f87804285 ]
    
    When running in XDP mode, pages come from the page pool, and should
    be freed back to the same pool or specifically detached.  Currently,
    when the driver re-initializes, the page pool destruction is delayed
    forever since it thinks there are oustanding pages.

    efi/x86: Don't panic or BUG() on non-critical error conditions
    
    [ Upstream commit e2d68a955e49d61fd0384f23e92058dc9b79be5e ]
    
    The logic in __efi_enter_virtual_mode() does a number of steps in
    sequence, all of which may fail in one way or the other. In most
    cases, we simply print an error and disable EFI runtime services
    support, but in some cases, we BUG() or panic() and bring down the
    system when encountering conditions that we could easily handle in
    the same way.
    
    While at it, replace a pointless page-to-virt-phys conversion with
    one that goes straight from struct page to physical.

    soc/tegra: fuse: Correct straps' address for older Tegra124 device trees
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d9ea1934f8ef0dfb862d103389562cc28b4fc03 ]
    
    Trying to read out Chip ID before APBMISC registers are mapped won't
    succeed, in a result Tegra124 gets a wrong address for the HW straps
    register if machine uses an old outdated device tree.

    kunit: remove timeout dependence on sysctl_hung_task_timeout_seconds
    
    [ Upstream commit 1c024d45151b51c8f8d4749e65958b0bcf3e7c52 ]
    
    In discussion of how to handle timeouts, it was noted that if
    sysctl_hung_task_timeout_seconds is exceeded for a kunit test,
    the test task will be killed and an oops generated.  This should
    suffice as a means of debugging such timeout issues for now.
    
    Hence remove use of sysctl_hung_task_timeout_secs, which has the
    added benefit of avoiding the need to export that symbol from
    the core kernel.

    As was stated in the bug report, the reason is that gcc runs into a corner
    case in the register allocator that is rather hard to fix in a good way.
    
    As there is an easy way to work around it, just add a comment and the
    barrier that stops gcc from trying to overoptimize the function.

    iommu/vt-d: Match CPU and IOMMU paging mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 79db7e1b4cf2a006f556099c13de3b12970fc6e3 ]
    
    When setting up first level page tables for sharing with CPU, we need
    to ensure IOMMU can support no less than the levels supported by the
    CPU.
    
    It is not adequate, as in the current code, to set up 5-level paging
    in PASID entry First Level Paging Mode(FLPM) solely based on CPU.
    
    Currently, intel_pasid_setup_first_level() is only used by native SVM
    code which already checks paging mode matches. However, future use of
    this helper function may not be limited to native SVM.

    ASoC: Intel: sof_rt5682: Ignore the speaker amp when there isn't one.
    
    [ Upstream commit d4b74e218a8d0d6cf58e546627ab9d4d4f2645ab ]
    
    Some members of the Google_Hatch family include a rt5682 jack codec, but
    no speaker amplifier. This uses the same driver (sof_rt5682) as a
    combination of rt5682 jack codec and max98357a speaker amplifier. Within
    the sof_rt5682 driver, these cases are not currently distinguishable,
    relying on a DMI quirk to decide the configuration. This causes an
    incorrect configuration when only the rt5682 is present on a
    Google_Hatch device.
    
    For CML, the jack codec is used as the primary key when matching,
    with a possible speaker amplifier described in quirk_data. The two cases
    of interest are the second and third 10EC5682 entries in
    snd_soc_acpi_intel_cml_machines[]. The second entry matches the
    combination of rt5682 and max98357a, resulting in the quirk_data field
    in the snd_soc_acpi_mach being non-null, pointing at
    max98357a_spk_codecs, the snd_soc_acpi_codecs for the matched speaker
    amplifier. The third entry matches just the rt5682, resulting in a null
    quirk_data.
    
    The sof_rt5682 driver's DMI data matching identifies that a speaker
    amplifier is present for all Google_Hatch family devices. Detect cases
    where there is no speaker amplifier by checking for a null quirk_data in
    the snd_soc_acpi_mach and remove the speaker amplifier bit in that case.

    vfio/spapr/nvlink2: Skip unpinning pages on error exit
    
    [ Upstream commit 338b4e10f939a71194d8ecef7ece205a942cec05 ]
    
    The nvlink2 subdriver for IBM Witherspoon machines preregisters
    GPU memory in the IOMMI API so KVM TCE code can map this memory
    for DMA as well. This is done by mm_iommu_newdev() called from
    vfio_pci_nvgpu_regops::mmap.
    
    In an unlikely event of failure the data->mem remains NULL and
    since mm_iommu_put() (which unregisters the region and unpins memory

    tools lib api fs: Fix gcc9 stringop-truncation compilation error
    
    [ Upstream commit 6794200fa3c9c3e6759dae099145f23e4310f4f7 ]
    
    GCC9 introduced string hardening mechanisms, which exhibits the error
    during fs api compilation:
    
    error: '__builtin_strncpy' specified bound 4096 equals destination size
    [-Werror=stringop-truncation]
    
    This comes when the length of copy passed to strncpy is is equal to
    destination size, which could potentially lead to buffer overflow.
    
    There is a need to mitigate this potential issue by limiting the size of
    destination by 1 and explicitly terminate the destination with NULL.

    A caveat is that the fixup hook for the mic mute LED has to be applied

    clk: Use parent node pointer during registration if necessary
    
    [ Upstream commit 9011f92622e5ef2d075f45e5fa818776d4feb8c0 ]
    
    Sometimes clk drivers are attached to devices which are children of a
    parent device that is connected to a node in DT. This happens when
    devices are MFD-ish and the parent device driver mostly registers child
    devices to match against drivers placed in their respective subsystem
    directories like drivers/clk, drivers/regulator, etc. When the clk
    driver calls clk_register() with a device pointer, that struct device
    pointer won't have a device_node associated with it because it was
    created purely in software as a way to partition logic to a subsystem.
    
    This causes problems for the way we find parent clks for the clks
    registered by these child devices because we look at the registering
    device's device_node pointer to lookup 'clocks' and 'clock-names'
    properties. Let's use the parent device's device_node pointer if the
    registering device doesn't have a device_node but the parent does. This
    simplifies clk registration code by avoiding the need to assign some
    device_node to the device registering the clk.

    ice: add extra check for null Rx descriptor
    
    [ Upstream commit 1f45ebe0d8fbe6178670b663005f38ef8535db5d ]
    
    In the case where the hardware gives us a null Rx descriptor, it is
    theoretically possible that we could call one of our skb-construction
    functions with no data pointer, which would cause a panic.
    
    In real life, this will never happen - we only get null RX
    descriptors as the final descriptor in a chain of otherwise-valid
    descriptors. When this happens, the skb will be extant and we'll just
    call ice_add_rx_frag(), which can deal with empty data buffers.
    
    Unfortunately, Coverity does not have intimate knowledge of our
    hardware, so we must add a check here.

    pinctrl: sh-pfc: sh7269: Fix CAN function GPIOs
    
    [ Upstream commit 02aeb2f21530c98fc3ca51028eda742a3fafbd9f ]
    
    pinmux_func_gpios[] contains a hole due to the missing function GPIO
    definition for the "CTX0&CTX1" signal, which is the logical "AND" of the
    first two CAN outputs.
    
    A closer look reveals other issues:
      - Some functionality is available on alternative pins, but the
        PINMUX_DATA() entries is using the wrong marks,
      - Several configurations are missing.
    
    Fix this by:
      - Renaming CTX0CTX1CTX2_MARK, CRX0CRX1_PJ22_MARK, and
        CRX0CRX1CRX2_PJ20_MARK to CTX0_CTX1_CTX2_MARK, CRX0_CRX1_PJ22_MARK,
        resp. CRX0_CRX1_CRX2_PJ20_MARK for consistency with the
        corresponding enum IDs,
      - Adding all missing enum IDs and marks,
      - Use the right (*_PJ2x) variants for alternative pins,
      - Adding all missing configurations to pinmux_data[],
      - Adding all missing function GPIO definitions to pinmux_func_gpios[].

    drm/fbdev: Fallback to non tiled mode if all tiles not present
    
    [ Upstream commit f25c7a006cd1c07254780e3406e45cee4842b933 ]
    
    In case of tiled displays, if we hotplug just one connector,
    fbcon currently just selects the preferred mode and if it is
    tiled mode then that becomes a problem if rest of the tiles are
    not present.
    So in the fbdev driver on hotplug when we probe the client modeset,
    if we dont find all the connectors for all tiles, then on a connector
    with one tile, just fallback to the first available non tiled mode
    to display over a single connector.
    On the hotplug of the consecutive tiled connectors, if the tiled mode
    no longer exists because of fbcon size limitation, then return
    no modes for consecutive tiles but retain the non tiled mode
    on the 0th tile.
    Use the same logic in case of connected boot case as well.
    This has been tested with Dell UP328K tiled monitor.
    
    v2:
    * Set the modes on consecutive hotplugged tiles to no mode
    if tiled mode is pruned (Dave)
    v1:
    * Just handle the 1st connector hotplug case

    PM / devfreq: exynos-ppmu: Fix excessive stack usage
    
    [ Upstream commit d4556f5e99d5f603913bac01adaff8670cb2d08b ]
    
    Putting a 'struct devfreq_event_dev' object on the stack is generally
    a bad idea and here it leads to a warnig about potential stack overflow:
    
    drivers/devfreq/event/exynos-ppmu.c:643:12: error: stack frame size of 1040 bytes in function 'exynos_ppmu_probe' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=]
    
    There is no real need for the device structure, only the string inside
    it, so add an internal helper function that simply takes the string
    as its argument and remove the device structure.

    net: phy: realtek: add logging for the RGMII TX delay configuration
    
    [ Upstream commit 3aec743d69822d22d4a5b60deb9518ed8be6fa67 ]
    
    RGMII requires a delay of 2ns between the data and the clock signal.
    There are at least three ways this can happen. One possibility is by
    having the PHY generate this delay.
    This is a common source for problems (for example with slow TX speeds or
    packet loss when sending data). The TX delay configuration of the
    RTL8211F PHY can be set either by pin-strappping the RXD1 pin (HIGH
    means enabled, LOW means disabled) or through configuring a paged
    register. The setting from the RXD1 pin is also reflected in the
    register.
    
    Add debug logging to the TX delay configuration on RTL8211F so it's
    easier to spot these issues (for example if the TX delay is enabled for
    both, the RTL8211F PHY and the MAC).
    This is especially helpful because there is no public datasheet for the
    RTL8211F PHY available with all the RX/TX delay specifics.

    The current descriptor is not on any list of the virtual DMA channel.
    Once sdma_terminate_all() is called when a descriptor is currently
    in flight then this one is forgotten to be freed. We have to call
    vchan_terminate_vdesc() on this descriptor to re-add it to the lists.
    Now that we also free the currently running descriptor we can (and
    actually have to) remove the current descriptor from its list also
    for the cyclic case.

    dmaengine: Store module owner in dma_device struct
    
    [ Upstream commit dae7a589c18a4d979d5f14b09374e871b995ceb1 ]
    
    dma_chan_to_owner() dereferences the driver from the struct device to
    obtain the owner and call module_[get|put](). However, if the backing
    device is unbound before the dma_device is unregistered, the driver
    will be cleared and this will cause a NULL pointer dereference.
    
    Instead, store a pointer to the owner module in the dma_device struct
    so the module reference can be properly put when the channel is put, even
    if the backing device was destroyed first.
    
    This change helps to support a safer unbind of DMA engines.
    If the dma_device is unregistered in the driver's remove function,
    there's no guarantee that there are no existing clients and a users
    action may trigger the WARN_ONCE in dma_async_device_unregister()
    which is unlikely to leave the system in a consistent state.
    Instead, a better approach is to allow the backing driver to go away
    and fail any subsequent requests to it.

    iommu/iova: Silence warnings under memory pressure
    
    [ Upstream commit 944c9175397476199d4dd1028d87ddc582c35ee8 ]
    
    When running heavy memory pressure workloads, this 5+ old system is
    throwing endless warnings below because disk IO is too slow to recover
    from swapping. Since the volume from alloc_iova_fast() could be large,
    once it calls printk(), it will trigger disk IO (writing to the log
    files) and pending softirqs which could cause an infinite loop and make
    no progress for days by the ongoimng memory reclaim. This is the counter
    part for Intel where the AMD part has already been merged. See the
    commit 3d708895325b ("iommu/amd: Silence warnings under memory
    pressure"). Since the allocation failure will be reported in
    intel_alloc_iova(), so just call dev_err_once() there because even the
    "ratelimited" is too much, and silence the one in alloc_iova_mem() to
    avoid the expensive warn_alloc().

    iommu/amd: Only support x2APIC with IVHD type 11h/40h
    
    [ Upstream commit 966b753cf3969553ca50bacd2b8c4ddade5ecc9e ]
    
    Current implementation for IOMMU x2APIC support makes use of
    the MMIO access to MSI capability block registers, which requires
    checking EFR[MsiCapMmioSup]. However, only IVHD type 11h/40h contain
    the information, and not in the IVHD type 10h IOMMU feature reporting
    field. Since the BIOS in newer systems, which supports x2APIC, would
    normally contain IVHD type 11h/40h, remove the IOMMU_FEAT_XTSUP_SHIFT
    check for IVHD type 10h, and only support x2APIC with IVHD type 11h/40h.

    iommu/amd: Check feature support bit before accessing MSI capability registers
    
    [ Upstream commit 813071438e83d338ba5cfe98b3b26c890dc0a6c0 ]
    
    The IOMMU MMIO access to MSI capability registers is available only if
    the EFR[MsiCapMmioSup] is set. Current implementation assumes this bit
    is set if the EFR[XtSup] is set, which might not be the case.
    
    Fix by checking the EFR[MsiCapMmioSup] before accessing the MSI address
    low/high and MSI data registers via the MMIO.

    PCI/ATS: Restore EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() for pci_{enable,disable}_ats()
    
    [ Upstream commit bb950bca5d522119f8b9ce3f6cbac4841c6d6517 ]
    
    Commit d355bb209783 ("PCI/ATS: Remove unnecessary EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()")
    unexported a bunch of symbols from the PCI core since the only external
    users were non-modular IOMMU drivers. Although most of those symbols
    can remain private for now, 'pci_{enable,disable_ats()' is required for
    the ARM SMMUv3 driver to build as a module, otherwise we get a build
    failure as follows:
    
      | ERROR: "pci_enable_ats" [drivers/iommu/arm-smmu-v3.ko] undefined!
      | ERROR: "pci_disable_ats" [drivers/iommu/arm-smmu-v3.ko] undefined!
    
    Re-export these two functions so that the ARM SMMUv3 driver can be build
    as a module.

    [ Upstream commit df9166bfa7750bade5737ffc91fbd432e0354442 ]
    
    This patch reworks the fdmi symbolic node name data for the following two
    issues:
    
     - Correcting extraneous periods following the DV and HN fdmi data fields.
    
     - Avoiding buffer overflow issues when formatting the data.
    
    The fix to the fist issue is to just remove the characters.
    
    The fix to the second issue has all data being staged in temporary storage
    before being moved to the real buffer.

    [ Upstream commit 2df74b6985b51e77756e2e8faa16c45ca3ba53c5 ]
    
    In UFS host reset and restore path, before probe, we stop and start the
    host controller once. After host controller is stopped, the pending
    requests, if any, are cleared from the doorbell, but no completion IRQ
    would be raised due to the hba is stopped.  These pending requests shall be
    completed along with the first NOP_OUT command (as it is the first command
    which can raise a transfer completion IRQ) sent during probe.  Since the
    OCSs of these pending requests are not SUCCESS (because they are not yet
    literally finished), their UPIUs shall be dumped. When there are multiple
    pending requests, the UPIU dump can be overwhelming and may lead to
    stability issues because it is in atomic context.  Therefore, before probe,
    complete these pending requests right after host controller is stopped and
    silence the UPIU dump from them.

    ACPICA: Disassembler: create buffer fields in ACPI_PARSE_LOAD_PASS1
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ddbd77181dfca61b16d2e2222382ea65637f1b9 ]
    
    ACPICA commit 29cc8dbc5463a93625bed87d7550a8bed8913bf4
    
    create_buffer_field is a deferred op that is typically processed in
    load pass 2. However, disassembly of control method contents walk the
    parse tree with ACPI_PARSE_LOAD_PASS1 and AML_CREATE operators are
    processed in a later walk. This is a problem when there is a control
    method that has the same name as the AML_CREATE object. In this case,
    any use of the name segment will be detected as a method call rather
    than a reference to a buffer field. If this is detected as a method
    call, it can result in a mal-formed parse tree if the control methods
    have parameters.
    
    This change in processing AML_CREATE ops earlier solves this issue by
    inserting the named object in the ACPI namespace so that references
    to this name would be detected as a name string rather than a method
    call.

    issues:
    MEC is ruined by the amdkfd_pre_reset after VF FLR done
    
    fix:
    amdkfd_pre_reset() would ruin MEC after hypervisor finished the VF FLR,
    the correct sequence is do amdkfd_pre_reset before VF FLR but there is
    a limitation to block this sequence:
    if we do pre_reset() before VF FLR, it would go KIQ way to do register
    access and stuck there, because KIQ probably won't work by that time
    (e.g. you already made GFX hang)
    
    so the best way right now is to simply remove it.

    drm/amd/display: Lower DPP DTO only when safe
    
    [ Upstream commit 5479034576ec8b7166a66efe5de1d911feb43d4a ]
    
    [Why]
    A corner case currently exists where DPP DTO is lowered before
    pipes are updated to a higher viewport. This causes underflow
    as the DPPCLK is too low for the current viewport.
    
    [How]
    Only lower DPP DTO when it is safe to lower, or if
    the newer clocks are higher than the current ones.

    drm/amd/display: Fix update_bw_bounding_box Calcs
    
    [ Upstream commit 615b9b585eb57c1d49382d16a62de768f2c6a340 ]
    
    [Why]
    Previously update_bw_bounding_box for RN was commented out
    due to incorrect values causing BSOD on Hybrid Graphics.
    However, commenting out this function also may cause issues
    such as underflow in certain cases such as 2x4K displays.
    
    [How]
    Fix dram_speed_mts calculations.
    Update from proper index of clock_limits[]

    The PLX PEX NTB forwards DMA transactions using Requester IDs that don't

    r8169: check that Realtek PHY driver module is loaded
    
    [ Upstream commit f325937735498afb054a0195291bbf68d0b60be5 ]
    
    Some users complained about problems with r8169 and it turned out that
    the generic PHY driver was used instead instead of the dedicated one.
    In all cases reason was that r8169.ko was in initramfs, but realtek.ko
    not. Manually adding realtek.ko to initramfs fixed the issues.
    Root cause seems to be that tools like dracut and genkernel don't
    consider softdeps. Add a check for loaded Realtek PHY driver module
    and provide the user with a hint if it's not loaded.

    samples/bpf: Set -fno-stack-protector when building BPF programs
    
    [ Upstream commit 450278977acbf494a20367c22fbb38729772d1fc ]
    
    It seems Clang can in some cases turn on stack protection by default, which
    doesn't work with BPF. This was reported once before[0], but it seems the
    flag to explicitly turn off the stack protector wasn't added to the
    Makefile, so do that now.
    
    The symptom of this is compile errors like the following:
    
    error: <unknown>:0:0: in function bpf_prog1 i32 (%struct.__sk_buff*): A call to built-in function '__stack_chk_fail' is not supported.

    media: v4l2-device.h: Explicitly compare grp{id,mask} to zero in v4l2_device macros
    
    [ Upstream commit afb34781620274236bd9fc9246e22f6963ef5262 ]
    
    When building with Clang + -Wtautological-constant-compare, several of
    the ivtv and cx18 drivers warn along the lines of:
    
     drivers/media/pci/cx18/cx18-driver.c:1005:21: warning: converting the
     result of '<<' to a boolean always evaluates to true
     [-Wtautological-constant-compare]
                             cx18_call_hw(cx, CX18_HW_GPIO_RESET_CTRL,
                                             ^

                                               ^
     1 warning generated.
    
    This warning happens because the shift operation is implicitly converted
    to a boolean in v4l2_device_mask_call_all before being negated. This can
    be solved by just comparing the mask result to 0 explicitly so that
    there is no boolean conversion. The ultimate goal is to enable
    -Wtautological-compare globally because there are several subwarnings
    that would be helpful to have.
    
    For visual consistency and avoidance of these warnings in the future,
    all of the implicitly boolean conversions in the v4l2_device macros
    are converted to explicit ones as well.

    selftests/net: make so_txtime more robust to timer variance
    
    [ Upstream commit ea6a547669b37453f2b1a5d85188d75b3613dfaa ]
    
    The SO_TXTIME test depends on accurate timers. In some virtualized
    environments the test has been reported to be flaky. This is easily
    reproduced by disabling kvm acceleration in Qemu.
    
    Allow greater variance in a run and retry to further reduce flakiness.
    
    Observed errors are one of two kinds: either the packet arrives too
    early or late at recv(), or it was dropped in the qdisc itself and the
    recv() call times out.
    
    In the latter case, the qdisc queues a notification to the error
    queue of the send socket. Also explicitly report this cause.

    PCI: Increase D3 delay for AMD Ryzen5/7 XHCI controllers
    
    [ Upstream commit 3030df209aa8cf831b9963829bd9f94900ee8032 ]
    
    On Asus UX434DA (AMD Ryzen7 3700U) and Asus X512DK (AMD Ryzen5 3500U), the
    XHCI controller fails to resume from runtime suspend or s2idle, and USB
    becomes unusable from that point.
    
      xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.4: Refused to change power state, currently in D3
      xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.4: enabling device (0000 -> 0002)
      xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.4: WARN: xHC restore state timeout
      xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.4: PCI post-resume error -110!
      xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.4: HC died; cleaning up
    
    During suspend, a transition to D3cold is attempted, however the affected
    platforms do not seem to cut the power to the PCI device when in this
    state, so the device stays in D3hot.
    
    Upon resume, the D3hot-to-D0 transition is successful only if the D3 delay
    is increased to 20ms. The transition failure does not appear to be
    detectable as a CRS condition. Add a PCI quirk to increase the delay on the
    affected hardware.

    media: cx23885: Add support for AVerMedia CE310B
    
    [ Upstream commit dc4cac67e13515835ed8081d510aa507aacb013b ]
    
    The AVerMedia CE310B is a simple composite + S-Video + stereo audio
    capture card, and uses only the CX23888 to perform all of these
    functions.
    
    I've tested both video inputs and the audio interface and confirmed that
    they're all working. However, there are some issues:
    
    * Sometimes when I switch inputs the video signal turns black and can't
      be recovered until the system is rebooted. I haven't been able to
      determine the cause of this behavior, nor have I found a solution to
      fix it or any workarounds other than rebooting.
    * The card sometimes seems to have trouble syncing to the video signal,
      and some of the VBI data appears as noise at the top of the frame, but
      I assume that to be a result of my very noisy RF environment and the
      card's unshielded input traces rather than a configuration issue.

    PCI: iproc: Apply quirk_paxc_bridge() for module as well as built-in
    
    [ Upstream commit 574f29036fce385e28617547955dd6911d375025 ]
    
    Previously quirk_paxc_bridge() was applied when the iproc driver was
    built-in, but not when it was compiled as a module.
    
    This happened because it was under #ifdef CONFIG_PCIE_IPROC_PLATFORM:
    PCIE_IPROC_PLATFORM=y causes CONFIG_PCIE_IPROC_PLATFORM to be defined, but
    PCIE_IPROC_PLATFORM=m causes CONFIG_PCIE_IPROC_PLATFORM_MODULE to be
    defined.
    
    Move quirk_paxc_bridge() to pcie-iproc.c and drop the #ifdef so the quirk
    is always applied, whether iproc is built-in or a module.
    
    [bhelgaas: commit log, move to pcie-iproc.c, not pcie-iproc-platform.c]

    cpumask_weight() in padata_cpu_hash() returns 0 because the mask has no

    early and so doesn't mark the instance PADATA_INVALID as expected, which
    would have made padata_do_parallel() return error before doing the
    division.
    
    Fix by introducing a second padata CPU hotplug state before
    CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU so that __padata_remove_cpu() sees the online mask
    without @cpu.  No need for the second argument to padata_replace() since
    @cpu is now already missing from the online mask.

    Qiang Zhao points out that these offsets get written to 16-bit
    registers, and there are some QE platforms with more than 64K
    muram. So it is possible that qe_muram_alloc() gives us an allocation
    that can't actually be used by the hardware, so detect and reject

    regulator: rk808: Lower log level on optional GPIOs being not available
    
    [ Upstream commit b8a039d37792067c1a380dc710361905724b9b2f ]
    
    RK808 can leverage a couple of GPIOs to tweak the ramp rate during DVS
    (Dynamic Voltage Scaling). These GPIOs are entirely optional but a
    dev_warn() appeared when cleaning this driver to use a more up-to-date
    gpiod API. At least reduce the log level to 'info' as it is totally
    fine to not populate these GPIO on a hardware design.
    
    This change is trivial but it is worth not polluting the logs during
    bringup phase by having real warnings and errors sorted out
    correctly.

    ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: solve MSI issues by merging ipc and stream irq handlers
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c11af9fcdc425b80f140a218d4fef9f17734bfc ]
    
    The existing code uses two handlers for a shared edge-based MSI interrupts.
    In corner cases, interrupts are lost, leading to IPC timeouts. Those
    timeouts do not appear in legacy mode.
    
    This patch merges the two handlers and threads into a single one, and
    simplifies the mask/unmask operations by using a single top-level mask
    (Global Interrupt Enable). The handler only checks for interrupt
    sources using the Global Interrupt Status (GIS) field, and all the
    actual work happens in the thread. This also enables us to remove the
    use of spin locks. Stream events are prioritized over IPC ones.
    
    This patch was tested with HDaudio and SoundWire platforms, and all
    known IPC timeout issues are solved in MSI mode. The
    SoundWire-specific patches will be provided in follow-up patches,
    where the SoundWire interrupts are handled in the same thread as IPC
    and stream interrupts.

    Although it appeared to follow logically from the bindings, apparently
    the thermal framework can't properly cope with a single cooling device
    being shared between multiple maps. The CPU zone is probably easier to
    overheat, so remove the references to the (optional) fan from the GPU
    cooling zone to avoid things getting confused. Hopefully GPU-intensive
    tasks will leak enough heat across to the CPU zone to still hit the
    fan trips before reaching critical GPU temperatures.

    bpf, sockhash: Synchronize_rcu before free'ing map
    
    [ Upstream commit 0b2dc83906cf1e694e48003eae5df8fa63f76fd9 ]
    
    We need to have a synchronize_rcu before free'ing the sockhash because any
    outstanding psock references will have a pointer to the map and when they
    use it, this could trigger a use after free.
    
    This is a sister fix for sockhash, following commit 2bb90e5cc90e ("bpf:

    drm/amdkfd: Fix a bug in SDMA RLC queue counting under HWS mode
    
    [ Upstream commit f38abc15d157b7b31fa7f651dc8bf92858c963f8 ]
    
    The sdma_queue_count increment should be done before
    execute_queues_cpsch(), which calls pm_calc_rlib_size() where
    sdma_queue_count is used to calculate whether over_subscription is
    triggered.
    
    With the previous code, when a SDMA queue is created,
    compute_queue_count in pm_calc_rlib_size() is one more than the
    actual compute queue number, because the queue_count has been
    incremented while sdma_queue_count has not. This patch fixes that.

    kconfig: fix broken dependency in randconfig-generated .config
    
    [ Upstream commit c8fb7d7e48d11520ad24808cfce7afb7b9c9f798 ]
    
    Running randconfig on arm64 using KCONFIG_SEED=0x40C5E904 (e.g. on v5.5)
    produces the .config with CONFIG_EFI=y and CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN=y,
    which does not meet the !CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN dependency.
    
    This is because the user choice for CONFIG_CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN vs
    CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN is set by randomize_choice_values() after the
    value of CONFIG_EFI is calculated.
    
    When this happens, the has_changed flag should be set.
    
    Currently, it takes the result from the last iteration. It should
    accumulate all the results of the loop.

    block, bfq: do not plug I/O for bfq_queues with no proc refs

    referred by any process") fixed commit 3726112ec731 ("block, bfq:
    re-schedule empty queues if they deserve I/O plugging") by
    descheduling an empty bfq_queue when it remains with not process
    reference. Yet, this still left a case uncovered: an empty bfq_queue
    with not process reference that remains in service. This happens for
    an in-service sync bfq_queue that is deemed to deserve I/O-dispatch
    plugging when it remains empty. Yet no new requests will arrive for
    such a bfq_queue if no process sends requests to it any longer. Even
    worse, the bfq_queue may happen to be prematurely freed while still in
    service (because there may remain no reference to it any longer).
    
    This commit solves this problem by preventing I/O dispatch from being
    plugged for the in-service bfq_queue, if the latter has no process
    reference (the bfq_queue is then prevented from remaining in service).

    Btrfs: keep pages dirty when using btrfs_writepage_fixup_worker
    
    [ Upstream commit 25f3c5021985e885292980d04a1423fd83c967bb ]
    
    For COW, btrfs expects pages dirty pages to have been through a few setup
    steps.  This includes reserving space for the new block allocations and marking
    the range in the state tree for delayed allocation.
    
    A few places outside btrfs will dirty pages directly, especially when unmapping
    mmap'd pages.  In order for these to properly go through COW, we run them
    through a fixup worker to wait for stable pages, and do the delalloc prep.
    
    87826df0ec36 added a window where the dirty pages were cleaned, but pending
    more action from the fixup worker.  We clear_page_dirty_for_io() before
    we call into writepage, so the page is no longer dirty.  The commit
    changed it so now we leave the page clean between unlocking it here and
    the fixup worker starting at some point in the future.
    
    During this window, page migration can jump in and relocate the page.  Once our
    fixup work actually starts, it finds page->mapping is NULL and we end up
    freeing the page without ever writing it.
    
    This leads to crc errors and other exciting problems, since it screws up the
    whole statemachine for waiting for ordered extents.  The fix here is to keep
    the page dirty while we're waiting for the fixup worker to get to work.
    This is accomplished by returning -EAGAIN from btrfs_writepage_cow_fixup
    if we queued the page up for fixup, which will cause the writepage
    function to redirty the page.
    
    Because we now expect the page to be dirty once it gets to the fixup
    worker we must adjust the error cases to call clear_page_dirty_for_io()
    on the page.  That is the bulk of the patch, but it is not the fix, the
    fix is the -EAGAIN from btrfs_writepage_cow_fixup.  We cannot separate
    these two changes out because the error conditions change with the new
    expectations.

    When kzalloc fail, may cause trying to destroy the

    If num_connections is m (2 < m), and NO.1 ~ NO.n
    (1 < n < m) kzalloc are successful. The NO.(n + 1)
    failed. Then, nbd_start_device will return ENOMEM
    to nbd_start_device_ioctl, and nbd_start_device_ioctl
    will return immediately without running flush_workqueue.
    However, we still have n recv threads. If nbd_release
    run first, recv threads may have to drop the last
    config_refs and try to destroy the workqueue from
    inside the workqueue.
    
    To fix it, add a flush_workqueue in nbd_start_device.

    tracing: Simplify assignment parsing for hist triggers
    
    [ Upstream commit b527b638fd63ba791dc90a0a6e9a3035b10df52b ]
    
    In the process of adding better error messages for sorting, I realized
    that strsep was being used incorrectly and some of the error paths I
    was expecting to be hit weren't and just fell through to the common
    invalid key error case.
    
    It also became obvious that for keyword assignments, it wasn't
    necessary to save the full assignment and reparse it later, and having
    a common empty-assignment check would also make more sense in terms of
    error processing.
    
    Change the code to fix these problems and simplify it for new error
    message changes in a subsequent patch.

    drm/amd/display: Retrain dongles when SINK_COUNT becomes non-zero
    
    [ Upstream commit 3eb6d7aca53d81ce888624f09cd44dc0302161e8 ]
    
    [WHY]
    Two years ago the patch referenced by the Fixes tag stopped running
    dp_verify_link_cap_with_retries during DP detection when the reason
    for the detection was a short-pulse interrupt. This effectively meant
    that we were no longer doing the verify_link_cap training on active
    dongles when their SINK_COUNT changed from 0 to 1.
    
    A year ago this was partly remedied with:
    commit 80adaebd2d41 ("drm/amd/display: Don't skip link training for empty dongle")
    
    This made sure that we trained the dongle on initial hotplug (without
    connected downstream devices).
    
    This is all fine and dandy if it weren't for the fact that there are
    some dongles on the market that don't like link training when SINK_COUNT
    is 0 These dongles will in fact indicate a SINK_COUNT of 0 immediately
    after hotplug, even when a downstream device is connected, and then
    trigger a shortpulse interrupt indicating a SINK_COUNT change to 1.
    
    In order to play nicely we will need our policy to not link train an
    active DP dongle when SINK_COUNT is 0 but ensure we train it when the
    SINK_COUNT changes to 1.
    
    [HOW]
    Call dp_verify_link_cap_with_retries on detection even when the detection
    is triggered from a short pulse interrupt.
    
    With this change we can also revert this commit which we'll do in a separate
    follow-up change:
    commit 80adaebd2d41 ("drm/amd/display: Don't skip link training for empty dongle")

    [ Upstream commit 34719de919af07682861cb0fa2bcf64da33ecf44 ]
    
    Merely enabling I2C and RTC selects REGMAP_I2C and REGMAP_SPI, even when
    no driver needs it.  While the former can be moduler, the latter cannot,
    and thus becomes built-in.
    
    Fix this by moving the select statements for REGMAP_I2C and REGMAP_SPI
    from the RTC_I2C_AND_SPI helper to the individual drivers that depend on
    it.
    
    Note that the comment for RTC_I2C_AND_SPI refers to SND_SOC_I2C_AND_SPI
    for more information, but the latter does not select REGMAP_{I2C,SPI}
    itself, and defers that to the individual drivers, too.

    selftests: settings: tests can be in subsubdirs
    
    [ Upstream commit ac87813d4372f4c005264acbe3b7f00c1dee37c4 ]
    
    Commit 852c8cbf34d3 ("selftests/kselftest/runner.sh: Add 45 second
    timeout per test") adds support for a new per-test-directory "settings"
    file. But this only works for tests not in a sub-subdirectories, e.g.
    
     - tools/testing/selftests/rtc (rtc) is OK,
     - tools/testing/selftests/net/mptcp (net/mptcp) is not.
    
    We have to increase the timeout for net/mptcp tests which are not
    upstreamed yet but this fix is valid for other tests if they need to add
    a "settings" file, see the full list with:
    
      tools/testing/selftests/*/*/**/Makefile
    
    Note that this patch changes the text header message printed at the end
    of the execution but this text is modified only for the tests that are
    in sub-subdirectories, e.g.
    
      ok 1 selftests: net/mptcp: mptcp_connect.sh
    
    Before we had:
    
      ok 1 selftests: mptcp: mptcp_connect.sh

    brcmfmac: sdio: Fix OOB interrupt initialization on brcm43362
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c8e60fb86a90a30721bbd797f58f96b3980dcc1 ]
    
    Commit 262f2b53f679 ("brcmfmac: call brcmf_attach() just before calling
    brcmf_bus_started()") changed the initialization order of the brcmfmac
    SDIO driver. Unfortunately since brcmf_sdiod_intr_register() is now
    called before the sdiodev->bus_if initialization, it reads the wrong
    chip ID and fails to initialize the GPIO on brcm43362. Thus the chip
    cannot send interrupts and fails to probe:

    rtw88: fix rate mask for 1SS chip
    
    [ Upstream commit 35a68fa5f96a80797e11b6952a47c5a84939a7bf ]
    
    The rate mask is used to tell firmware the supported rate depends on
    negotiation. We loop 2 times for all VHT/HT 2SS rate mask first, and then
    only keep the part according to chip's NSS.
    
    This commit fixes the logic error of '&' operations for VHT/HT rate, and
    we should run this logic before adding legacy rate.
    
    To access HT MCS map, index 0/1 represent MCS 0-7/8-15 respectively. Use
    NL80211_BAND_xxx is incorrect, so fix it as well.

    ath10k: Correct the DMA direction for management tx buffers
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ba8b3b6bd772f575f7736c8fd893c6981fcce16 ]
    
    The management packets, send to firmware via WMI, are
    mapped using the direction DMA_TO_DEVICE. Currently in
    case of wmi cleanup, these buffers are being unmapped
    using an incorrect DMA direction. This can cause unwanted
    behavior when the host driver is handling a restart
    of the wlan firmware.

    with zero errno, jbd2_journal_abort() didn't set this flag so we can
    no longer panic. Fix this by always record the proper errno in the

    tracing: Fix very unlikely race of registering two stat tracers
    
    [ Upstream commit dfb6cd1e654315168e36d947471bd2a0ccd834ae ]
    
    Looking through old emails in my INBOX, I came across a patch from Luis
    Henriques that attempted to fix a race of two stat tracers registering the
    same stat trace (extremely unlikely, as this is done in the kernel, and
    probably doesn't even exist). The submitted patch wasn't quite right as it
    needed to deal with clean up a bit better (if two stat tracers were the
    same, it would have the same files).
    
    But to make the code cleaner, all we needed to do is to keep the
    all_stat_sessions_mutex held for most of the registering function.

    powerpc/iov: Move VF pdev fixup into pcibios_fixup_iov()
    
    [ Upstream commit 965c94f309be58fbcc6c8d3e4f123376c5970d79 ]
    
    An ioda_pe for each VF is allocated in pnv_pci_sriov_enable() before
    the pci_dev for the VF is created. We need to set the pe->pdev pointer
    at some point after the pci_dev is created. Currently we do that in:
    
    pcibios_bus_add_device()
            pnv_pci_dma_dev_setup() (via phb->ops.dma_dev_setup)
                    /* fixup is done here */
                    pnv_pci_ioda_dma_dev_setup() (via pnv_phb->dma_dev_setup)
    
    The fixup needs to be done before setting up DMA for for the VF's PE,
    but there's no real reason to delay it until this point. Move the
    fixup into pnv_pci_ioda_fixup_iov() so the ordering is:
    
            pcibios_add_device()
                    pnv_pci_ioda_fixup_iov() (via ppc_md.pcibios_fixup_sriov)
    
            pcibios_bus_add_device()
                    ...
    
    This isn't strictly required, but it's a slightly more logical place
    to do the fixup and it simplifies pnv_pci_dma_dev_setup().

    s390/pci: Fix possible deadlock in recover_store()
    
    [ Upstream commit 576c75e36c689bec6a940e807bae27291ab0c0de ]
    
    With zpci_disable() working, lockdep detected a potential deadlock
    (lockdep output at the end).
    
    The deadlock is between recovering a PCI function via the
    
    /sys/bus/pci/devices/<dev>/recover
    
    attribute vs powering it off via
    
    /sys/bus/pci/slots/<slot>/power.
    
    The fix is analogous to the changes in commit 0ee223b2e1f6 ("scsi: core:
    Avoid that SCSI device removal through sysfs triggers a deadlock")
    that fixed a potential deadlock on removing a SCSI device via sysfs.

    irqchip/gic-v3-its: Fix get_vlpi_map() breakage with doorbells
    
    [ Upstream commit 093bf439fee0d40ade7e309c1288b409cdc3b38f ]
    
    When updating an LPI configuration, get_vlpi_map() may be passed a
    irq_data structure relative to an ITS domain (the normal case) or one
    that is relative to the core GICv3 domain in the case of a GICv4
    doorbell.
    
    In the latter case, special care must be take not to dereference
    the irq_chip data as an its_dev structure, as that isn't what is
    stored there. Instead, check *first* whether the IRQ is forwarded
    to a vcpu, and only then try to obtain the vlpi mapping.

    udf: Allow writing to 'Rewritable' partitions
    
    [ Upstream commit 15fb05fd286ac57a0802d71624daeb5c1c2d5b07 ]
    
    UDF 2.60 standard states in section 2.2.14.2:
    
        A partition with Access Type 3 (rewritable) shall define a Freed
        Space Bitmap or a Freed Space Table, see 2.3.3. All other partitions
        shall not define a Freed Space Bitmap or a Freed Space Table.
    
        Rewritable partitions are used on media that require some form of
        preprocessing before re-writing data (for example legacy MO). Such
        partitions shall use Access Type 3.
    
        Overwritable partitions are used on media that do not require
        preprocessing before overwriting data (for example: CD-RW, DVD-RW,
        DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, BD-RE, HD DVD-Rewritable). Such partitions shall
        use Access Type 4.
    
    however older versions of the standard didn't have this wording and
    there are tools out there that create UDF filesystems with rewritable
    partitions but that don't contain a Freed Space Bitmap or a Freed Space
    Table on media that does not require pre-processing before overwriting a
    block. So instead of forcing media with rewritable partition read-only,
    base this decision on presence of a Freed Space Bitmap or a Freed Space
    Table.

    ext4: fix deadlock allocating bio_post_read_ctx from mempool
    
    [ Upstream commit 68e45330e341dad2d3a0a3f8ef2ec46a2a0a3bbc ]
    
    Without any form of coordination, any case where multiple allocations
    from the same mempool are needed at a time to make forward progress can
    deadlock under memory pressure.
    
    This is the case for struct bio_post_read_ctx, as one can be allocated
    to decrypt a Merkle tree page during fsverity_verify_bio(), which itself
    is running from a post-read callback for a data bio which has its own
    struct bio_post_read_ctx.
    
    Fix this by freeing the first bio_post_read_ctx before calling
    fsverity_verify_bio().  This works because verity (if enabled) is always
    the last post-read step.
    
    This deadlock can be reproduced by trying to read from an encrypted
    verity file after reducing NUM_PREALLOC_POST_READ_CTXS to 1 and patching
    mempool_alloc() to pretend that pool->alloc() always fails.
    
    Note that since NUM_PREALLOC_POST_READ_CTXS is actually 128, to actually
    hit this bug in practice would require reading from lots of encrypted
    verity files at the same time.  But it's theoretically possible, as N
    available objects isn't enough to guarantee forward progress when > N/2
    threads each need 2 objects at a time.

    jbd2: clear JBD2_ABORT flag before journal_reset to update log tail info when load journal
    
    [ Upstream commit a09decff5c32060639a685581c380f51b14e1fc2 ]
    
    If the journal is dirty when the filesystem is mounted, jbd2 will replay
    the journal but the journal superblock will not be updated by
    journal_reset() because JBD2_ABORT flag is still set (it was set in
    journal_init_common()). This is problematic because when a new transaction
    is then committed, it will be recorded in block 1 (journal->j_tail was set
    to 1 in journal_reset()). If unclean shutdown happens again before the
    journal superblock is updated, the new recorded transaction will not be
    replayed during the next mount (because of stale sb->s_start and
    sb->s_sequence values) which can lead to filesystem corruption.

    kselftest: Minimise dependency of get_size on C library interfaces
    
    [ Upstream commit 6b64a650f0b2ae3940698f401732988699eecf7a ]
    
    It was observed[1] on arm64 that __builtin_strlen led to an infinite
    loop in the get_size selftest.  This is because __builtin_strlen (and
    other builtins) may sometimes result in a call to the C library
    function.  The C library implementation of strlen uses an IFUNC
    resolver to load the most efficient strlen implementation for the
    underlying machine and hence has a PLT indirection even for static
    binaries.  Because this binary avoids the C library startup routines,
    the PLT initialization never happens and hence the program gets stuck
    in an infinite loop.
    
    On x86_64 the __builtin_strlen just happens to expand inline and avoid
    the call but that is not always guaranteed.
    
    Further, while testing on x86_64 (Fedora 31), it was observed that the
    test also failed with a segfault inside write() because the generated
    code for the write function in glibc seems to access TLS before the
    syscall (probably due to the cancellation point check) and fails
    because TLS is not initialised.
    
    To mitigate these problems, this patch reduces the interface with the
    C library to just the syscall function.  The syscall function still
    sets errno on failure, which is undesirable but for now it only
    affects cases where syscalls fail.

    usb: gadget: udc: fix possible sleep-in-atomic-context bugs in gr_probe()
    
    [ Upstream commit 9c1ed62ae0690dfe5d5e31d8f70e70a95cb48e52 ]
    
    The driver may sleep while holding a spinlock.

    kzalloc(GFP_KERNEL), mutex_lock(), debugfs_create_file() and
    devm_request_threaded_irq() can sleep at runtime.
    
    To fix these possible bugs, usb_add_gadget_udc(), gr_dfs_create() and
    gr_request_irq() are called without handling the spinlock.
    
    These bugs are found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by myself.

    spi: fsl-lpspi: fix only one cs-gpio working
    
    [ Upstream commit bc3a8b295e5bca9d1ec2622a6ba38289f9fd3d8a ]
    
    Why it does not work at the moment:
    - num_chipselect sets the number of cs-gpios that are in the DT.
      This comes from drivers/spi/spi.c
    - num_chipselect gets set with devm_spi_register_controller, that is
      called in drivers/spi/spi.c
    - devm_spi_register_controller got called after num_chipselect has
      been used.
    
    How this commit fixes the issue:
    - devm_spi_register_controller gets called before num_chipselect is
      being used.

    net: ethernet: ixp4xx: Standard module init
    
    [ Upstream commit c83db9ef5640548631707e8b4a7bcddc115fdbae ]
    
    The IXP4xx driver was initializing the MDIO bus before even
    probing, in the callbacks supposed to be used for setting up
    the module itself, and with the side effect of trying to
    register the MDIO bus as soon as this module was loaded or
    compiled into the kernel whether the device was discovered
    or not.
    
    This does not work with multiplatform environments.
    
    To get rid of this: set up the MDIO bus from the probe()
    callback and remove it in the remove() callback. Rename
    the probe() and remove() calls to reflect the most common
    conventions.
    
    Since there is a bit of checking for the ethernet feature
    to be present in the MDIO registering function, making the
    whole module not even be registered if we can't find an
    MDIO bus, we need something similar: register the MDIO
    bus when the corresponding ethernet is probed, and
    return -EPROBE_DEFER on the other interfaces until this
    happens. If no MDIO bus is present on any of the
    registered interfaces we will eventually bail out.
    
    None of the platforms I've seen has e.g. MDIO on EthB
    and only uses EthC, there is always a Ethernet hardware
    on the NPE (B, C) that has the MDIO bus, we just might
    have to wait for it.

    efi/x86: Map the entire EFI vendor string before copying it
    
    [ Upstream commit ffc2760bcf2dba0dbef74013ed73eea8310cc52c ]
    
    Fix a couple of issues with the way we map and copy the vendor string:
    - we map only 2 bytes, which usually works since you get at least a
      page, but if the vendor string happens to cross a page boundary,
      a crash will result
    - only call early_memunmap() if early_memremap() succeeded, or we will
      call it with a NULL address which it doesn't like,
    - while at it, switch to early_memremap_ro(), and array indexing rather
      than pointer dereferencing to read the CHAR16 characters.

    kprobes: Fix optimize_kprobe()/unoptimize_kprobe() cancellation logic
    
    [ Upstream commit e4add247789e4ba5e08ad8256183ce2e211877d4 ]
    
    optimize_kprobe() and unoptimize_kprobe() cancels if a given kprobe
    is on the optimizing_list or unoptimizing_list already. However, since
    the following commit:
    
      f66c0447cca1 ("kprobes: Set unoptimized flag after unoptimizing code")
    
    modified the update timing of the KPROBE_FLAG_OPTIMIZED, it doesn't
    work as expected anymore.
    
    The optimized_kprobe could be in the following states:
    
    - [optimizing]: Before inserting jump instruction
      op.kp->flags has KPROBE_FLAG_OPTIMIZED and
      op->list is not empty.
    
    - [optimized]: jump inserted
      op.kp->flags has KPROBE_FLAG_OPTIMIZED and
      op->list is empty.
    
    - [unoptimizing]: Before removing jump instruction (including unused
      optprobe)
      op.kp->flags has KPROBE_FLAG_OPTIMIZED and
      op->list is not empty.
    
    - [unoptimized]: jump removed
      op.kp->flags doesn't have KPROBE_FLAG_OPTIMIZED and
      op->list is empty.
    
    Current code mis-expects [unoptimizing] state doesn't have
    KPROBE_FLAG_OPTIMIZED, and that can cause incorrect results.
    
    To fix this, introduce optprobe_queued_unopt() to distinguish [optimizing]
    and [unoptimizing] states and fixes the logic in optimize_kprobe() and
    unoptimize_kprobe().

    pinctrl: baytrail: Do not clear IRQ flags on direct-irq enabled pins
    
    [ Upstream commit a23680594da7a9e2696dbcf4f023e9273e2fa40b ]
    
    Suspending Goodix touchscreens requires changing the interrupt pin to
    output before sending them a power-down command. Followed by wiggling
    the interrupt pin to wake the device up, after which it is put back
    in input mode.
    
    On Bay Trail devices with a Goodix touchscreen direct-irq mode is used
    in combination with listing the pin as a normal GpioIo resource.
    
    This works fine, until the goodix driver gets rmmod-ed and then insmod-ed
    again. In this case byt_gpio_disable_free() calls
    byt_gpio_clear_triggering() which clears the IRQ flags and after that the
    (direct) IRQ no longer triggers.
    
    This commit fixes this by adding a check for the BYT_DIRECT_IRQ_EN flag
    to byt_gpio_clear_triggering().
    
    Note that byt_gpio_clear_triggering() only gets called from
    byt_gpio_disable_free() for direct-irq enabled pins, as these are excluded
    from the irq_valid mask by byt_init_irq_valid_mask().

    IB/core: Let IB core distribute cache update events
    
    [ Upstream commit 6b57cea9221b0247ad5111b348522625e489a8e4 ]
    
    Currently when the low level driver notifies Pkey, GID, and port change
    events they are notified to the registered handlers in the order they are
    registered.
    
    IB core and other ULPs such as IPoIB are interested in GID, LID, Pkey
    change events.
    
    Since all GID queries done by ULPs are serviced by IB core, and the IB
    core deferes cache updates to a work queue, it is possible for other
    clients to see stale cache data when they handle their own events.
    
    For example, the below call tree shows how ipoib will call
    rdma_query_gid() concurrently with the update to the cache sitting in the
    WQ.
    
    mlx5_ib_handle_event()
      ib_dispatch_event()
        ib_cache_event()
           queue_work() -> slow cache update
    
        [..]
        ipoib_event()
         queue_work()
           [..]
           work handler
             ipoib_ib_dev_flush_light()
               __ipoib_ib_dev_flush()
                  ipoib_dev_addr_changed_valid()
                    rdma_query_gid() <- Returns old GID, cache not updated.
    
    Move all the event dispatch to a work queue so that the cache update is
    always done before any clients are notified.

    media: sti: bdisp: fix a possible sleep-in-atomic-context bug in bdisp_device_run()
    
    [ Upstream commit bb6d42061a05d71dd73f620582d9e09c8fbf7f5b ]
    
    The driver may sleep while holding a spinlock.
    The function call path (from bottom to top) in Linux 4.19 is:
    
    drivers/media/platform/sti/bdisp/bdisp-hw.c, 385:
        msleep in bdisp_hw_reset
    drivers/media/platform/sti/bdisp/bdisp-v4l2.c, 341:
        bdisp_hw_reset in bdisp_device_run
    drivers/media/platform/sti/bdisp/bdisp-v4l2.c, 317:
        _raw_spin_lock_irqsave in bdisp_device_run
    
    To fix this bug, msleep() is replaced with udelay().
    
    This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by myself.

    char/random: silence a lockdep splat with printk()
    
    [ Upstream commit 1b710b1b10eff9d46666064ea25f079f70bc67a8 ]
    
    Sergey didn't like the locking order,
    
    uart_port->lock  ->  tty_port->lock
    
    uart_write (uart_port->lock)
      __uart_start
        pl011_start_tx
          pl011_tx_chars
            uart_write_wakeup
              tty_port_tty_wakeup
                tty_port_default
                  tty_port_tty_get (tty_port->lock)
    
    but those code is so old, and I have no clue how to de-couple it after
    checking other locks in the splat. There is an onging effort to make all
    printk() as deferred, so until that happens, workaround it for now as a
    short-term fix.

    x86/fpu: Deactivate FPU state after failure during state load
    
    [ Upstream commit bbc55341b9c67645d1a5471506370caf7dd4a203 ]
    
    In __fpu__restore_sig(), fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx needs to be reset if the
    FPU state was not fully restored. Otherwise the following may happen (on
    the same CPU):
    
      Task A                     Task B               fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx
      *active*                                        A.fpu
      __fpu__restore_sig()
                                 ctx switch           load B.fpu
                                 *active*             B.fpu
      fpregs_lock()
      copy_user_to_fpregs_zeroing()
        copy_kernel_to_xregs() *modify*
        copy_user_to_xregs() *fails*
      fpregs_unlock()
                                ctx switch            skip loading B.fpu,
                                *active*              B.fpu
    
    In the success case, fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx is set to the current task.
    
    In the failure case, the FPU state might have been modified by loading
    the init state.
    
    In this case, fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx needs to be reset in order to ensure
    that the FPU state of the following task is loaded from saved state (and
    not skipped because it was the previous state).
    
    Reset fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx after a failure during restore occurred, to
    ensure that the FPU state for the next task is always loaded.

    The driver may sleep while holding a spinlock.
    The function call path (from bottom to top) in Linux 4.19 is:
    
    drivers/gpio/gpio-grgpio.c, 261:
            request_irq in grgpio_irq_map

            _raw_spin_lock_irqsave in grgpio_irq_unmap
    
    request_irq() and free_irq() can sleep at runtime.
    
    To fix these bugs, request_irq() and free_irq() are called without
    holding the spinlock.
    
    These bugs are found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by myself.

    The "mali_0" or "mali_1" clock trees should not be updated while the
    clock is running. Enforce this by setting CLK_SET_RATE_GATE on the
    "mali_0" and "mali_1" gates. This makes the CCF switch to the "mali_1"
    tree when "mali_0" is currently active and vice versa, which is exactly
    what the vendor driver does when updating the frequency of the mali
    clock.
    
    This fixes a potential hang when changing the GPU frequency at runtime.

    powerpc/powernv/iov: Ensure the pdn for VFs always contains a valid PE number
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b5b9997b331e77ce967eba2c4bc80dc3134a7fe ]
    
    On pseries there is a bug with adding hotplugged devices to an IOMMU
    group. For a number of dumb reasons fixing that bug first requires
    re-working how VFs are configured on PowerNV. For background, on
    PowerNV we use the pcibios_sriov_enable() hook to do two things:
    
      1. Create a pci_dn structure for each of the VFs, and
      2. Configure the PHB's internal BARs so the MMIO range for each VF
         maps to a unique PE.
    
    Roughly speaking a PE is the hardware counterpart to a Linux IOMMU
    group since all the devices in a PE share the same IOMMU table. A PE
    also defines the set of devices that should be isolated in response to
    a PCI error (i.e. bad DMA, UR/CA, AER events, etc). When isolated all
    MMIO and DMA traffic to and from devicein the PE is blocked by the
    root complex until the PE is recovered by the OS.
    
    The requirement to block MMIO causes a giant headache because the P8
    PHB generally uses a fixed mapping between MMIO addresses and PEs. As
    a result we need to delay configuring the IOMMU groups for device
    until after MMIO resources are assigned. For physical devices (i.e.
    non-VFs) the PE assignment is done in pcibios_setup_bridge() which is
    called immediately after the MMIO resources for downstream
    devices (and the bridge's windows) are assigned. For VFs the setup is
    more complicated because:
    
      a) pcibios_setup_bridge() is not called again when VFs are activated, and
      b) The pci_dev for VFs are created by generic code which runs after
         pcibios_sriov_enable() is called.
    
    The work around for this is a two step process:
    
      1. A fixup in pcibios_add_device() is used to initialised the cached
         pe_number in pci_dn, then
      2. A bus notifier then adds the device to the IOMMU group for the PE
         specified in pci_dn->pe_number.
    
    A side effect fixing the pseries bug mentioned in the first paragraph
    is moving the fixup out of pcibios_add_device() and into
    pcibios_bus_add_device(), which is called much later. This results in
    step 2. failing because pci_dn->pe_number won't be initialised when
    the bus notifier is run.
    
    We can fix this by removing the need for the fixup. The PE for a VF is
    known before the VF is even scanned so we can initialise
    pci_dn->pe_number pcibios_sriov_enable() instead. Unfortunately,
    moving the initialisation causes two problems:
    
      1. We trip the WARN_ON() in the current fixup code, and
      2. The EEH core clears pdn->pe_number when recovering a VF and
         relies on the fixup to correctly re-set it.
    
    The only justification for either of these is a comment in
    eeh_rmv_device() suggesting that pdn->pe_number *must* be set to
    IODA_INVALID_PE in order for the VF to be scanned. However, this
    comment appears to have no basis in reality. Both bugs can be fixed by
    just deleting the code.

    [ Upstream commit 66d9f5214c9ba1c151478f99520b6817302d50dc ]
    
    The prescaler works as parent rate divided by (PRES + 1) (is_pres_direct == 1)
    It does not work in the way of parent rate shifted to the right by (PRES + 1),
    which means division by 2^(PRES + 1) (is_pres_direct == 0)
    Thus is_pres_direct must be enabled for this SoC, to make the right computation.

    media: sun4i-csi: Fix [HV]sync polarity handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 1948dcf0f928b8bcdca57ca3fba8545ba380fc29 ]
    
    The Allwinner camera sensor interface has a different definition of
    [HV]sync. While the timing diagram uses the names HSYNC and VSYNC,
    the note following the diagram and register names use HREF and VREF.
    Combined they imply the hardware uses either [HV]REF or inverted
    [HV]SYNC. There are also registers to set horizontal skip lengths
    in pixels and vertical skip lengths in lines, also known as back
    porches.
    
    Fix the polarity handling by using the opposite polarity flag for
    the checks. Also rename `[hv]sync_pol` to `[hv]ref_pol` to better
    match the hardware register description.

    [ Upstream commit 1451d5ae351d938a0ab1677498c893f17b9ee21d ]
    
    This driver supports both the mt9v032 (color) and the mt9v022 (mono)
    sensors. Depending on which sensor is used, the format from the sensor is
    different. The format.code inside the dev struct holds this information.
    The enum mbus and enum frame sizes need to take into account both type of
    sensors, not just the color one. To solve this, use the format.code in
    these functions instead of the hardcoded bayer color format (which is only
    used for mt9v032).

    drm/msm/adreno: fix zap vs no-zap handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 15ab987c423df561e0949d77fb5043921ae59956 ]
    
    We can have two cases, when it comes to "zap" fw.  Either the fw
    requires zap fw to take the GPU out of secure mode at boot, or it does
    not and we can write RBBM_SECVID_TRUST_CNTL directly.  Previously we
    decided based on whether zap fw load succeeded, but this is not a great
    plan because:
    
    1) we could have zap fw in the filesystem on a device where it is not
       required
    2) we could have the inverse case
    
    Instead, shift to deciding based on whether we have a 'zap-shader' node
    in dt.  In practice, there is only one device (currently) with upstream
    dt that does not use zap (cheza), and it already has a /delete-node/ for
    the zap-shader node.

    drm/mipi_dbi: Fix off-by-one bugs in mipi_dbi_blank()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ce18249af5a28031b3f909cfafccc88ea966c9d ]
    
    When configuring the frame memory window, the last column and row
    numbers are written to the column resp. page address registers.  These
    numbers are thus one less than the actual window width resp. height.
    
    While this is handled correctly in mipi_dbi_fb_dirty() since commit
    03ceb1c8dfd1e293 ("drm/tinydrm: Fix setting of the column/page end
    addresses."), it is not in mipi_dbi_blank().  The latter still forgets
    to subtract one when calculating the most significant bytes of the
    column and row numbers, thus programming wrong values when the display
    width or height is a multiple of 256.

    Commit f92b070f2dc8 ("printk: Do not miss new messages when replaying

    store when an exclusive console should stop printing. It should be
    set to the @console_seq value at registration. However, @console_seq
    is previously set to @syslog_seq so that the exclusive console knows
    where to begin. This results in the exclusive console immediately
    reactivating all the other consoles and thus repeating the messages
    for those consoles.
    
    Set @console_seq after @exclusive_console_stop_seq has stored the
    current @console_seq value.

    pinctrl: sh-pfc: sh7264: Fix CAN function GPIOs
    
    [ Upstream commit 55b1cb1f03ad5eea39897d0c74035e02deddcff2 ]
    
    pinmux_func_gpios[] contains a hole due to the missing function GPIO
    definition for the "CTX0&CTX1" signal, which is the logical "AND" of the
    two CAN outputs.
    
    Fix this by:
      - Renaming CRX0_CRX1_MARK to CTX0_CTX1_MARK, as PJ2MD[2:0]=010
        configures the combined "CTX0&CTX1" output signal,
      - Renaming CRX0X1_MARK to CRX0_CRX1_MARK, as PJ3MD[1:0]=10 configures
        the shared "CRX0/CRX1" input signal, which is fed to both CAN
        inputs,
      - Adding the missing function GPIO definition for "CTX0&CTX1" to
        pinmux_func_gpios[],
      - Moving all CAN enums next to each other.
    
    See SH7262 Group, SH7264 Group User's Manual: Hardware, Rev. 4.00:
      [1] Figure 1.2 (3) (Pin Assignment for the SH7264 Group (1-Mbyte
          Version),

      [6] Section 32.2.30 (3) Port J Control Register 0 (PJCR0).
    
    Note that the last 2 disagree about PJ2MD[2:0], which is probably the
    root cause of this bug.  But considering [4], "CTx0&CTx1" in [5] must
    be correct, and "CRx0&CRx1" in [6] must be wrong.

    gianfar: Fix TX timestamping with a stacked DSA driver
    
    [ Upstream commit c26a2c2ddc0115eb088873f5c309cf46b982f522 ]
    
    The driver wrongly assumes that it is the only entity that can set the
    SKBTX_IN_PROGRESS bit of the current skb. Therefore, in the
    gfar_clean_tx_ring function, where the TX timestamp is collected if
    necessary, the aforementioned bit is used to discriminate whether or not
    the TX timestamp should be delivered to the socket's error queue.
    
    But a stacked driver such as a DSA switch can also set the
    SKBTX_IN_PROGRESS bit, which is actually exactly what it should do in
    order to denote that the hardware timestamping process is undergoing.
    
    Therefore, gianfar would misinterpret the "in progress" bit as being its
    own, and deliver a second skb clone in the socket's error queue,
    completely throwing off a PTP process which is not expecting to receive
    it, _even though_ TX timestamping is not enabled for gianfar.
    
    There have been discussions [0] as to whether non-MAC drivers need or
    not to set SKBTX_IN_PROGRESS at all (whose purpose is to avoid sending 2
    timestamps, a sw and a hw one, to applications which only expect one).
    But as of this patch, there are at least 2 PTP drivers that would break
    in conjunction with gianfar: the sja1105 DSA switch and the felix
    switch, by way of its ocelot core driver.
    
    So regardless of that conclusion, fix the gianfar driver to not do stuff
    based on flags set by others and not intended for it.

    ALSA: ctl: allow TLV read operation for callback type of element in locked case
    
    [ Upstream commit d61fe22c2ae42d9fd76c34ef4224064cca4b04b0 ]
    
    A design of ALSA control core allows applications to execute three
    operations for TLV feature; read, write and command. Furthermore, it
    allows driver developers to process the operations by two ways; allocated
    array or callback function. In the former, read operation is just allowed,
    thus developers uses the latter when device driver supports variety of
    models or the target model is expected to dynamically change information
    stored in TLV container.
    
    The core also allows applications to lock any element so that the other
    applications can't perform write operation to the element for element
    value and TLV information. When the element is locked, write and command
    operation for TLV information are prohibited as well as element value.
    Any read operation should be allowed in the case.
    
    At present, when an element has callback function for TLV information,
    TLV read operation returns EPERM if the element is locked. On the
    other hand, the read operation is success when an element has allocated
    array for TLV information. In both cases, read operation is success for
    element value expectedly.
    
    This commit fixes the bug. This change can be backported to v4.14
    kernel or later.

    leds: pca963x: Fix open-drain initialization
    
    [ Upstream commit 697529091ac7a0a90ca349b914bb30641c13c753 ]
    
    Before commit bb29b9cccd95 ("leds: pca963x: Add bindings to invert
    polarity") Mode register 2 was initialized directly with either 0x01
    or 0x05 for open-drain or totem pole (push-pull) configuration.
    
    Afterwards, MODE2 initialization started using bitwise operations on
    top of the default MODE2 register value (0x05). Using bitwise OR for
    setting OUTDRV with 0x01 and 0x05 does not produce correct results.
    When open-drain is used, instead of setting OUTDRV to 0, the driver
    keeps it as 1:
    
    Open-drain: 0x05 | 0x01 -> 0x05 (0b101 - incorrect)
    Totem pole: 0x05 | 0x05 -> 0x05 (0b101 - correct but still wrong)
    
    Now OUTDRV setting uses correct bitwise operations for initialization:
    
    Open-drain: 0x05 & ~0x04 -> 0x01 (0b001 - correct)
    Totem pole: 0x05 | 0x04 -> 0x05 (0b101 - correct)
    
    Additional MODE2 register definitions are introduced now as well.

    drm/amd/display: Map ODM memory correctly when doing ODM combine
    
    [ Upstream commit ec5b356c58941bb8930858155d9ce14ceb3d30a0 ]
    
    [why]
    Up to 4 ODM memory pieces are required per ODM combine and cannot
    overlap, i.e. each ODM "session" has to use its own memory pieces.
    The ODM-memory mapping is currently broken for generic case.
    
    The maximum number of memory pieces is ASIC-dependent, but it's always
    big enough to satisfy maximum number of ODM combines. Memory pieces
    are mapped as a bit-map, i.e. one memory piece corresponds to one bit.
    The OPTC doing ODM needs to select memory pieces by setting the
    corresponding bits, making sure there's no overlap with other OPTC
    instances that might be doing ODM.
    
    The current mapping works only for OPTC instance indexes smaller than
    3. For instance indexes 3 and up it practically maps no ODM memory,
    causing black, gray or white screen in display configs that include
    ODM on OPTC instance 3 or up.
    
    [how]
    Statically map two unique ODM memory pieces for each OPTC instance
    and piece them together when programming ODM combine mode.

    then triggers a WARN for running a work on the wrong CPU.
    
    Tejun then figured that set_cpus_allowed_ptr()'s stop_one_cpu() call
    could be ignored! When stopper->enabled is false, stop_machine will
    insta complete the work, without actually doing the work. Worse, it
    will not WARN about this (we really should fix this).
    
    It turns out there is a small window where a freshly online'ed CPU is
    marked 'online' but doesn't yet have the stopper task running:
    
            BP                              AP
    
            bringup_cpu()
              __cpu_up(cpu, idle)    -->    start_secondary()
                                            ...
                                            cpu_startup_entry()
              bringup_wait_for_ap()
                wait_for_ap_thread() <--      cpuhp_online_idle()
                                              while (1)
                                                do_idle()
    
                                            ... available to run kthreads ...
    
                stop_machine_unpark()
                  stopper->enable = true;
    
    Close this by moving the stop_machine_unpark() into
    cpuhp_online_idle(), such that the stopper thread is ready before we
    start the idle loop and schedule.

    f2fs: preallocate DIO blocks when forcing buffered_io
    
    [ Upstream commit 47501f87c61ad2aa234add63e1ae231521dbc3f5 ]
    
    The previous preallocation and DIO decision like below.
    
                             allow_outplace_dio              !allow_outplace_dio

    !f2fs_force_buffered_io  No_Prealloc / DIO               Prealloc / DIO
    
    But, Javier reported Case (*) where zoned device bypassed preallocation but
    fell back to buffered writes in f2fs_direct_IO(), resulting in stale data
    being read.
    
    In order to fix the issue, actually we need to preallocate blocks whenever
    we fall back to buffered IO like this. No change is made in the other cases.

    rcu: Fix missed wakeup of exp_wq waiters
    
    [ Upstream commit fd6bc19d7676a060a171d1cf3dcbf6fd797eb05f ]
    
    Tasks waiting within exp_funnel_lock() for an expedited grace period to
    elapse can be starved due to the following sequence of events:
    
    1.      Tasks A and B both attempt to start an expedited grace
            period at about the same time.  This grace period will have
            completed when the lower four bits of the rcu_state structure's
            ->expedited_sequence field are 0b'0100', for example, when the
            initial value of this counter is zero.  Task A wins, and thus
            does the actual work of starting the grace period, including
            acquiring the rcu_state structure's .exp_mutex and sets the
            counter to 0b'0001'.
    
    2.      Because task B lost the race to start the grace period, it
            waits on ->expedited_sequence to reach 0b'0100' inside of
            exp_funnel_lock(). This task therefore blocks on the rcu_node
            structure's ->exp_wq[1] field, keeping in mind that the
            end-of-grace-period value of ->expedited_sequence (0b'0100')
            is shifted down two bits before indexing the ->exp_wq[] field.
    
    3.      Task C attempts to start another expedited grace period,
            but blocks on ->exp_mutex, which is still held by Task A.
    
    4.      The aforementioned expedited grace period completes, so that
            ->expedited_sequence now has the value 0b'0100'.  A kworker task
            therefore acquires the rcu_state structure's ->exp_wake_mutex
            and starts awakening any tasks waiting for this grace period.
    
    5.      One of the first tasks awakened happens to be Task A.  Task A
            therefore releases the rcu_state structure's ->exp_mutex,
            which allows Task C to start the next expedited grace period,
            which causes the lower four bits of the rcu_state structure's
            ->expedited_sequence field to become 0b'0101'.
    
    6.      Task C's expedited grace period completes, so that the lower four
            bits of the rcu_state structure's ->expedited_sequence field now
            become 0b'1000'.
    
    7.      The kworker task from step 4 above continues its wakeups.
            Unfortunately, the wake_up_all() refetches the rcu_state
            structure's .expedited_sequence field:
    
            wake_up_all(&rnp->exp_wq[rcu_seq_ctr(rcu_state.expedited_sequence) & 0x3]);
    
            This results in the wakeup being applied to the rcu_node
            structure's ->exp_wq[2] field, which is unfortunate given that
            Task B is instead waiting on ->exp_wq[1].
    
    On a busy system, no harm is done (or at least no permanent harm is done).
    Some later expedited grace period will redo the wakeup.  But on a quiet
    system, such as many embedded systems, it might be a good long time before
    there was another expedited grace period.  On such embedded systems,
    this situation could therefore result in a system hang.
    
    This issue manifested as DPM device timeout during suspend (which
    usually qualifies as a quiet time) due to a SCSI device being stuck in
    _synchronize_rcu_expedited(), with the following stack trace:
    
            schedule()
            synchronize_rcu_expedited()
            synchronize_rcu()
            scsi_device_quiesce()
            scsi_bus_suspend()
            dpm_run_callback()
            __device_suspend()
    
    This commit therefore prevents such delays, timeouts, and hangs by
    making rcu_exp_wait_wake() use its "s" argument consistently instead of
    refetching from rcu_state.expedited_sequence.

    Commit 18cd8c93e69e ("rcu/nocb: Print gp/cb kthread hierarchy if

    debugging, but incorrectly guarded them, causing the function to always
    spew out its message.
    
    This patch fixes it by guarding both pr_alert statements with dump_tree,
    while also changing the second pr_alert to a pr_cont, to print the
    hierarchy in a single line (assuming that's how it was supposed to
    work).

    [ Upstream commit 5b1413f00b5beb9f5fed94e43ea0c497d5db9633 ]
    
    There is a check on the retry counter invalid_buf_id_retry that is always
    false because invalid_buf_id_retry is initialized to zero on each iteration
    of a while-loop.  Fix this by initializing the retry counter before the
    while-loop starts.

    ath10k: Fix qmi init error handling

    When ath10k_qmi_init() fails, the error handling does not free the irq
    resources, which causes an issue if we EPROBE_DEFER as we'll attempt to
    (re-)register irqs which are already registered.
    
    Fix this by doing a power off since we just powered on the hardware, and
    freeing the irqs as error handling.

    drm/gma500: Fixup fbdev stolen size usage evaluation
    
    [ Upstream commit fd1a5e521c3c083bb43ea731aae0f8b95f12b9bd ]
    
    psbfb_probe performs an evaluation of the required size from the stolen
    GTT memory, but gets it wrong in two distinct ways:
    - The resulting size must be page-size-aligned;
    - The size to allocate is derived from the surface dimensions, not the fb
      dimensions.
    
    When two connectors are connected with different modes, the smallest will
    be stored in the fb dimensions, but the size that needs to be allocated must
    match the largest (surface) dimensions. This is what is used in the actual
    allocation code.
    
    Fix this by correcting the evaluation to conform to the two points above.
    It allows correctly switching to 16bpp when one connector is e.g. 1920x1080
    and the other is 1024x768.

    enic: prevent waking up stopped tx queues over watchdog reset
    
    [ Upstream commit 0f90522591fd09dd201065c53ebefdfe3c6b55cb ]
    
    Recent months, our customer reported several kernel crashes all
    preceding with following message:
    NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth2 (enic): transmit queue 0 timed out
    Error message of one of those crashes:
    BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffffffa007e090
    
    After analyzing severl vmcores, I found that most of crashes are
    caused by memory corruption. And all the corrupted memory areas
    are overwritten by data of network packets. Moreover, I also found
    that the tx queues were enabled over watchdog reset.
    
    After going through the source code, I found that in enic_stop(),
    the tx queues stopped by netif_tx_disable() could be woken up over
    a small time window between netif_tx_disable() and the
    napi_disable() by the following code path:
    napi_poll->
      enic_poll_msix_wq->
         vnic_cq_service->
            enic_wq_service->
               netif_wake_subqueue(enic->netdev, q_number)->
                  test_and_clear_bit(__QUEUE_STATE_DRV_XOFF, &txq->state)
    In turn, upper netowrk stack could queue skb to ENIC NIC though
    enic_hard_start_xmit(). And this might introduce some race condition.
    
    Our customer comfirmed that this kind of kernel crash doesn't occur over
    90 days since they applied this patch.

    core: Don't skip generic XDP program execution for cloned SKBs
    
    [ Upstream commit ad1e03b2b3d4430baaa109b77bc308dc73050de3 ]
    
    The current generic XDP handler skips execution of XDP programs entirely if
    an SKB is marked as cloned. This leads to some surprising behaviour, as
    packets can end up being cloned in various ways, which will make an XDP
    program not see all the traffic on an interface.
    
    This was discovered by a simple test case where an XDP program that always
    returns XDP_DROP is installed on a veth device. When combining this with
    the Scapy packet sniffer (which uses an AF_PACKET) socket on the sending
    side, SKBs reliably end up in the cloned state, causing them to be passed
    through to the receiving interface instead of being dropped. A minimal
    reproducer script for this is included below.
    
    This patch fixed the issue by simply triggering the existing linearisation
    code for cloned SKBs instead of skipping the XDP program execution. This
    behaviour is in line with the behaviour of the native XDP implementation
    for the veth driver, which will reallocate and copy the SKB data if the SKB
    is marked as shared.
    
    Reproducer Python script (requires BCC and Scapy):
