    netfilter: x_tables: do compat validation via translate_table
    
    commit 09d9686047dbbe1cf4faa558d3ecc4aae2046054 upstream.
    
    This looks like refactoring, but its also a bug fix.
    
    Problem is that the compat path (32bit iptables, 64bit kernel) lacks a few
    sanity tests that are done in the normal path.
    
    For example, we do not check for underflows and the base chain policies.
    
    While its possible to also add such checks to the compat path, its more
    copy&pastry, for instance we cannot reuse check_underflow() helper as
    e->target_offset differs in the compat case.
    
    Other problem is that it makes auditing for validation errors harder; two
    places need to be checked and kept in sync.
    
    At a high level 32 bit compat works like this:
    1- initial pass over blob:
       validate match/entry offsets, bounds checking
       lookup all matches and targets
       do bookkeeping wrt. size delta of 32/64bit structures
       assign match/target.u.kernel pointer (points at kernel
       implementation, needed to access ->compatsize etc.)
    
    2- allocate memory according to the total bookkeeping size to
       contain the translated ruleset
    
    3- second pass over original blob:
       for each entry, copy the 32bit representation to the newly allocated
       memory.  This also does any special match translations (e.g.
       adjust 32bit to 64bit longs, etc).
    
    4- check if ruleset is free of loops (chase all jumps)
    
    5-first pass over translated blob:
       call the checkentry function of all matches and targets.
    
    The alternative implemented by this patch is to drop steps 3&4 from the
    compat process, the translation is changed into an intermediate step
    rather than a full 1:1 translate_table replacement.
    
    In the 2nd pass (step #3), change the 64bit ruleset back to a kernel
    representation, i.e. put() the kernel pointer and restore ->u.user.name .
    
    This gets us a 64bit ruleset that is in the format generated by a 64bit
    iptables userspace -- we can then use translate_table() to get the
    'native' sanity checks.
    
    This has two drawbacks:
    
    1. we re-validate all the match and target entry structure sizes even
    though compat translation is supposed to never generate bogus offsets.
    2. we put and then re-lookup each match and target.
    
    THe upside is that we get all sanity tests and ruleset validations
    provided by the normal path and can remove some duplicated compat code.
    
    iptables-restore time of autogenerated ruleset with 300k chains of form
    -A CHAIN0001 -m limit --limit 1/s -j CHAIN0002
    -A CHAIN0002 -m limit --limit 1/s -j CHAIN0003
    
    shows no noticeable differences in restore times:
    old:   0m30.796s
    new:   0m31.521s
    64bit: 0m25.674s

    netfilter: x_tables: don't reject valid target size on some architectures
    
    commit 7b7eba0f3515fca3296b8881d583f7c1042f5226 upstream.
    
    Quoting John Stultz:
      In updating a 32bit arm device from 4.6 to Linus' current HEAD, I
      noticed I was having some trouble with networking, and realized that
      /proc/net/ip_tables_names was suddenly empty.
      Digging through the registration process, it seems we're catching on the:
    
       if (strcmp(t->u.user.name, XT_STANDARD_TARGET) == 0 &&
           target_offset + sizeof(struct xt_standard_target) != next_offset)
             return -EINVAL;
    
      Where next_offset seems to be 4 bytes larger then the
      offset + standard_target struct size.
    
    next_offset needs to be aligned via XT_ALIGN (so we can access all members
    of ip(6)t_entry struct).
    
    This problem didn't show up on i686 as it only needs 4-byte alignment for
    u64, but iptables userspace on other 32bit arches does insert extra padding.

    Validate that all matches (if any) add up to the beginning of
    the target and that each match covers at least the base structure size.
    
    The compat path should be able to safely re-use the function
    as the structures only differ in alignment; added a
    BUILD_BUG_ON just in case we have an arch that adds padding as well.

    netfilter: x_tables: check for bogus target offset
    
    commit ce683e5f9d045e5d67d1312a42b359cb2ab2a13c upstream.
    
    We're currently asserting that targetoff + targetsize <= nextoff.
    
    Extend it to also check that targetoff is >= sizeof(xt_entry).
    Since this is generic code, add an argument pointing to the start of the
    match/target, we can then derive the base structure size from the delta.
    
    We also need the e->elems pointer in a followup change to validate matches.

    netfilter: x_tables: check standard target size too
    
    commit 7ed2abddd20cf8f6bd27f65bd218f26fa5bf7f44 upstream.
    
    We have targets and standard targets -- the latter carries a verdict.
    
    The ip/ip6tables validation functions will access t->verdict for the
    standard targets to fetch the jump offset or verdict for chainloop
    detection, but this happens before the targets get checked/validated.
    
    Thus we also need to check for verdict presence here, else t->verdict
    can point right after a blob.
    
    Spotted with UBSAN while testing malformed blobs.

    commit 7d35812c3214afa5b37a675113555259cfd67b98 upstream.
    
    Currently arp/ip and ip6tables each implement a short helper to check that
    the target offset is large enough to hold one xt_entry_target struct and
    that t->u.target_size fits within the current rule.
    
    Unfortunately these checks are not sufficient.

    checks into a helper, then extend this helper in followup patches.

    drm/core: Do not preserve framebuffer on rmfb, v4.
    
    commit f2d580b9a8149735cbc4b59c4a8df60173658140 upstream.
    
    It turns out that preserving framebuffers after the rmfb call breaks
    vmwgfx userspace. This was originally introduced because it was thought
    nobody relied on the behavior, but unfortunately it seems there are
    exceptions.
    
    drm_framebuffer_remove may fail with -EINTR now, so a straight revert
    is impossible. There is no way to remove the framebuffer from the lists
    and active planes without introducing a race because of the different
    locking requirements. Instead call drm_framebuffer_remove from a
    workqueue, which is unaffected by signals.
    
    Changes since v1:
    - Add comment.
    Changes since v2:
    - Add fastpath for refcount = 1. (danvet)
    Changes since v3:
    - Rebased.
    - Restore lastclose framebuffer removal too.

    netfilter: x_tables: fix unconditional helper
    
    commit 54d83fc74aa9ec72794373cb47432c5f7fb1a309 upstream.
    
    Ben Hawkes says:
    
     In the mark_source_chains function (net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c) it
     is possible for a user-supplied ipt_entry structure to have a large
     next_offset field. This field is not bounds checked prior to writing a
     counter value at the supplied offset.
    
    Problem is that mark_source_chains should not have been called --
    the rule doesn't have a next entry, so its supposed to return
    an absolute verdict of either ACCEPT or DROP.
    
    However, the function conditional() doesn't work as the name implies.
    It only checks that the rule is using wildcard address matching.
    
    However, an unconditional rule must also not be using any matches
    (no -m args).
    
    The underflow validator only checked the addresses, therefore
    passing the 'unconditional absolute verdict' test, while
    mark_source_chains also tested for presence of matches, and thus
    proceeeded to the next (not-existent) rule.
    
    Unify this so that all the callers have same idea of 'unconditional rule'.

    commit bdf533de6968e9686df777dc178486f600c6e617 upstream.
    
    We should check that e->target_offset is sane before
    mark_source_chains gets called since it will fetch the target entry
    for loop detection.

    TASK_SIZE was defined as 0x7fff8000UL which for 64k pages is not a
    multiple of the page size.  Somewhere further down the math fails
    such that executing an ELF binary fails.

    sparc64: Fix return from trap window fill crashes.
    
    [ Upstream commit 7cafc0b8bf130f038b0ec2dcdd6a9de6dc59b65a ]
    
    We must handle data access exception as well as memory address unaligned
    exceptions from return from trap window fill faults, not just normal
    TLB misses.
    
    Otherwise we can get an OOPS that looks like this:

    The window trap handlers are slightly clever, the trap table entries for them are
    composed of two pieces of code.  First comes the code that actually performs
    the window fill or spill trap handling, and then there are three instructions at
    the end which are for exception processing.
    
    The userland register window fill handler is:
    
            add     %sp, STACK_BIAS + 0x00, %g1;            \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g0] ASI, %l0;                   \
            mov     0x08, %g2;                              \
            mov     0x10, %g3;                              \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g2] ASI, %l1;                   \
            mov     0x18, %g5;                              \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g3] ASI, %l2;                   \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g5] ASI, %l3;                   \
            add     %g1, 0x20, %g1;                         \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g0] ASI, %l4;                   \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g2] ASI, %l5;                   \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g3] ASI, %l6;                   \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g5] ASI, %l7;                   \
            add     %g1, 0x20, %g1;                         \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g0] ASI, %i0;                   \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g2] ASI, %i1;                   \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g3] ASI, %i2;                   \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g5] ASI, %i3;                   \
            add     %g1, 0x20, %g1;                         \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g0] ASI, %i4;                   \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g2] ASI, %i5;                   \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g3] ASI, %i6;                   \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g5] ASI, %i7;                   \
            restored;                                       \
            retry; nop; nop; nop; nop;                      \
            b,a,pt  %xcc, fill_fixup_dax;                   \
            b,a,pt  %xcc, fill_fixup_mna;                   \
            b,a,pt  %xcc, fill_fixup;
    
    And the way this works is that if any of those memory accesses
    generate an exception, the exception handler can revector to one of
    those final three branch instructions depending upon which kind of
    exception the memory access took.  In this way, the fault handler
    doesn't have to know if it was a spill or a fill that it's handling
    the fault for.  It just always branches to the last instruction in
    the parent trap's handler.
    
    For example, for a regular fault, the code goes:
    
    winfix_trampoline:
            rdpr    %tpc, %g3
            or      %g3, 0x7c, %g3
            wrpr    %g3, %tnpc
            done
    
    All window trap handlers are 0x80 aligned, so if we "or" 0x7c into the
    trap time program counter, we'll get that final instruction in the
    trap handler.
    
    On return from trap, we have to pull the register window in but we do
    this by hand instead of just executing a "restore" instruction for
    several reasons.  The largest being that from Niagara and onward we
    simply don't have enough levels in the trap stack to fully resolve all
    possible exception cases of a window fault when we are already at
    trap level 1 (which we enter to get ready to return from the original
    trap).
    
    This is executed inline via the FILL_*_RTRAP handlers.  rtrap_64.S's
    code branches directly to these to do the window fill by hand if
    necessary.  Now if you look at them, we'll see at the end:
    
                ba,a,pt    %xcc, user_rtt_fill_fixup;
                ba,a,pt    %xcc, user_rtt_fill_fixup;
                ba,a,pt    %xcc, user_rtt_fill_fixup;
    
    And oops, all three cases are handled like a fault.
    
    This doesn't work because each of these trap types (data access
    exception, memory address unaligned, and faults) store their auxiliary
    info in different registers to pass on to the C handler which does the
    real work.
    
    So in the case where the stack was unaligned, the unaligned trap
    handler sets up the arg registers one way, and then we branched to
    the fault handler which expects them setup another way.
    
    So the FAULT_TYPE_* value ends up basically being garbage, and
    randomly would generate the backtrace seen above.

    [ Upstream commit 9ea46abe22550e3366ff7cee2f8391b35b12f730 ]
    
    On cheetahplus chips we take the ctx_alloc_lock in order to
    modify the TLB lookup parameters for the indexed TLBs, which
    are stored in the context register.
    
    This is called with interrupts disabled, however ctx_alloc_lock
    is an IRQ safe lock, therefore we must take acquire/release it
    properly with spin_{lock,unlock}_irq().

    sparc64: Reduce TLB flushes during hugepte changes
    
    [ Upstream commit 24e49ee3d76b70853a96520e46b8837e5eae65b2 ]
    
    During hugepage map/unmap, TSB and TLB flushes are currently
    issued at every PAGE_SIZE'd boundary which is unnecessary.
    We now issue the flush at REAL_HPAGE_SIZE boundaries only.
    
    Without this patch workloads which unmap a large hugepage
    backed VMA region get CPU lockups due to excessive TLB
    flush calls.

    Same panic happened with Intel ixgbe driver also.
    
    SR-IOV code looks for arch specific data while enabling
    VFs. When VF device is added, driver probe function makes set
    of calls to initialize the pci device. Because the VF device is
    added different way than the normal PF device(which happens via
    of_create_pci_dev for sparc), some of the arch specific initialization
    does not happen for VF device.  That causes panic when archdata is
    accessed.
    
    To fix this, I have used already defined weak function
    pcibios_setup_device to copy archdata from PF to VF.
    Also verified the fix.

    Orabug: 22495713
    
    Currently, NUMA node distance matrix is initialized only
    when a machine descriptor (MD) exists. However, sun4u
    machines (e.g. Sun Blade 2500) do not have an MD and thus
    distance values were left uninitialized. The initialization
    is now moved such that it happens on both sun4u and sun4v.

    sparc64: Fix bootup regressions on some Kconfig combinations.
    
    [ Upstream commit 49fa5230462f9f2c4e97c81356473a6bdf06c422 ]
    
    The system call tracing bug fix mentioned in the Fixes tag
    below increased the amount of assembler code in the sequence
    of assembler files included by head_64.S
    
    This caused to total set of code to exceed 0x4000 bytes in
    size, which overflows the expression in head_64.S that works
    to place swapper_tsb at address 0x408000.
    
    When this is violated, the TSB is not properly aligned, and
    also the trap table is not aligned properly either.  All of
    this together results in failed boots.
    
    So, do two things:
    
    1) Simplify some code by using ba,a instead of ba/nop to get
       those bytes back.
    
    2) Add a linker script assertion to make sure that if this
       happens again the build will fail.

    A system call trace trigger on entry allows the tracing

    process's registers.
    
    Account for that by reloading the %g1 (syscall number)
    and %i0-%i5 (syscall argument) values.  We need to be
    careful to revalidate the range of %g1, and reload the
    system call table entry it corresponds to into %l7.

    fix d_walk()/non-delayed __d_free() race
    
    commit 3d56c25e3bb0726a5c5e16fc2d9e38f8ed763085 upstream.
    
    Ascend-to-parent logics in d_walk() depends on all encountered child
    dentries not getting freed without an RCU delay.  Unfortunately, in
    quite a few cases it is not true, with hard-to-hit oopsable race as
    the result.
    
    Fortunately, the fix is simiple; right now the rule is "if it ever
    been hashed, freeing must be delayed" and changing it to "if it
    ever had a parent, freeing must be delayed" closes that hole and
    covers all cases the old rule used to cover.  Moreover, pipes and
    sockets remain _not_ covered, so we do not introduce RCU delay in
    the cases which are the reason for having that delay conditional
    in the first place.

    sched: panic on corrupted stack end
    
    commit 29d6455178a09e1dc340380c582b13356227e8df upstream.
    
    Until now, hitting this BUG_ON caused a recursive oops (because oops
    handling involves do_exit(), which calls into the scheduler, which in
    turn raises an oops), which caused stuff below the stack to be
    overwritten until a panic happened (e.g.  via an oops in interrupt
    context, caused by the overwritten CPU index in the thread_info).
    
    Just panic directly.

    proc: prevent stacking filesystems on top
    
    commit e54ad7f1ee263ffa5a2de9c609d58dfa27b21cd9 upstream.
    
    This prevents stacking filesystems (ecryptfs and overlayfs) from using
    procfs as lower filesystem.  There is too much magic going on inside
    procfs, and there is no good reason to stack stuff on top of procfs.
    
    (For example, procfs does access checks in VFS open handlers, and
    ecryptfs by design calls open handlers from a kernel thread that doesn't
    drop privileges or so.)

    x86/entry/traps: Don't force in_interrupt() to return true in IST handlers
    
    commit aaee8c3c5cce2d9107310dd9f3026b4f901d441c upstream.
    
    Forcing in_interrupt() to return true if we're not in a bona fide
    interrupt confuses the softirq code.  This fixes warnings like:
    
      NOHZ: local_softirq_pending 282
    
    ... which can happen when running things like selftests/x86.
    
    This will change perf's static percpu buffer usage in IST context.
    I think this is okay, and it's changing the behavior to match
    historical (pre-4.0) behavior.

    wext: Fix 32 bit iwpriv compatibility issue with 64 bit Kernel
    
    commit 3d5fdff46c4b2b9534fa2f9fc78e90a48e0ff724 upstream.
    
    iwpriv app uses iw_point structure to send data to Kernel. The iw_point
    structure holds a pointer. For compatibility Kernel converts the pointer
    as required for WEXT IOCTLs (SIOCIWFIRST to SIOCIWLAST). Some drivers
    may use iw_handler_def.private_args to populate iwpriv commands instead
    of iw_handler_def.private. For those case, the IOCTLs from
    SIOCIWFIRSTPRIV to SIOCIWLASTPRIV will follow the path ndo_do_ioctl().
    Accordingly when the filled up iw_point structure comes from 32 bit
    iwpriv to 64 bit Kernel, Kernel will not convert the pointer and sends
    it to driver. So, the driver may get the invalid data.
    
    The pointer conversion for the IOCTLs (SIOCIWFIRSTPRIV to
    SIOCIWLASTPRIV), which follow the path ndo_do_ioctl(), is mandatory.
    This patch adds pointer conversion from 32 bit to 64 bit and vice versa,
    if the ioctl comes from 32 bit iwpriv to 64 bit Kernel.

    memcg_offline_kmem() may be called from memcg_free_kmem() after a css

    This means the userspace program clock_adjtime called the clock_adjtime()
    syscall and then crashed inside the compat_get_timex() function.
    Syscalls should never crash programs, but instead return EFAULT.
    
    The IIR register contains the executed instruction, which disassebles
    into "ldw 0(sr3,r5),r9".
    This load-word instruction is part of __get_user() which tried to read the word
    at %r5/IOR (0xfa6f7fff). This means the unaligned handler jumped in.  The
    unaligned handler is able to emulate all ldw instructions, but it fails if it
    fails to read the source e.g. because of page fault.
    
    The following program reproduces the problem:
    
    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <sys/syscall.h>
    #include <sys/mman.h>
    
    int main(void) {
            /* allocate 8k */
            char *ptr = mmap(NULL, 2*4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
            /* free second half (upper 4k) and make it invalid. */
            munmap(ptr+4096, 4096);
            /* syscall where first int is unaligned and clobbers into invalid memory region */
            /* syscall should return EFAULT */
            return syscall(__NR_clock_adjtime, 0, ptr+4095);
    }
    
    To fix this issue we simply need to check if the faulting instruction address
    is in the exception fixup table when the unaligned handler failed. If it
    is, call the fixup routine instead of crashing.
    
    While looking at the unaligned handler I found another issue as well: The
    target register should not be modified if the handler was unsuccessful.

    commit 5edf673d07fdcb6498be24914f3f38f8d8843199 upstream.
    
    When a dual-edge irq is triggered, an incorrect irq will be reported on
    condition that the external signal is not stable and this incorrect irq
    has been registered.
    Correct the register offset.

    powerpc/pseries: Add POWER8NVL support to ibm,client-architecture-support call
    
    commit 7cc851039d643a2ee7df4d18177150f2c3a484f5 upstream.
    
    If we do not provide the PVR for POWER8NVL, a guest on this system
    currently ends up in PowerISA 2.06 compatibility mode on KVM, since QEMU
    does not provide a generic PowerISA 2.07 mode yet. So some new
    instructions from POWER8 (like "mtvsrd") get disabled for the guest,
    resulting in crashes when using code compiled explicitly for
    POWER8 (e.g. with the "-mcpu=power8" option of GCC).

    powerpc: Fix definition of SIAR and SDAR registers
    
    commit d23fac2b27d94aeb7b65536a50d32bfdc21fe01e upstream.
    
    The SIAR and SDAR registers are available twice, one time as SPRs
    780 / 781 (unprivileged, but read-only), and one time as the SPRs
    796 / 797 (privileged, but read and write). The Linux kernel code
    currently uses the unprivileged  SPRs - while this is OK for reading,
    writing to that register of course does not work.
    Since the KVM code tries to write to this register, too (see the mtspr
    in book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S), the contents of this register sometimes get
    lost for the guests, e.g. during migration of a VM.
    To fix this issue, simply switch to the privileged SPR numbers instead.

    commit 871e178e0f2c4fa788f694721a10b4758d494ce1 upstream.
    
    In the "ibm,configure-pe" and "ibm,configure-bridge" RTAS calls, the
    spec states that values of 9900-9905 can be returned, indicating that
    software should delay for 10^x (where x is the last digit, i.e. 990x)
    milliseconds and attempt the call again. Currently, the kernel doesn't
    know about this, and respecting it fixes some PCI failures when the
    hypervisor is busy.
    
    The delay is capped at 0.2 seconds.

    arm64: mm: always take dirty state from new pte in ptep_set_access_flags
    
    commit 0106d456c4cb1770253fefc0ab23c9ca760b43f7 upstream.
    
    Commit 66dbd6e61a52 ("arm64: Implement ptep_set_access_flags() for
    hardware AF/DBM") ensured that pte flags are updated atomically in the
    face of potential concurrent, hardware-assisted updates. However, Alex
    reports that:
    
     | This patch breaks swapping for me.
     | In the broken case, you'll see either systemd cpu time spike (because
     | it's stuck in a page fault loop) or the system hang (because the
     | application owning the screen is stuck in a page fault loop).
    
    It turns out that this is because the 'dirty' argument to
    ptep_set_access_flags is always 0 for read faults, and so we can't use
    it to set PTE_RDONLY. The failing sequence is:
    
      1. We put down a PTE_WRITE | PTE_DIRTY | PTE_AF pte
      2. Memory pressure -> pte_mkold(pte) -> clear PTE_AF
      3. A read faults due to the missing access flag
      4. ptep_set_access_flags is called with dirty = 0, due to the read fault
      5. pte is then made PTE_WRITE | PTE_DIRTY | PTE_AF | PTE_RDONLY (!)
      6. A write faults, but pte_write is true so we get stuck
    
    The solution is to check the new page table entry (as would be done by
    the generic, non-atomic definition of ptep_set_access_flags that just
    calls set_pte_at) to establish the dirty state.

    crypto: ccp - Fix AES XTS error for request sizes above 4096
    
    commit ab6a11a7c8ef47f996974dd3c648c2c0b1a36ab1 upstream.
    
    The ccp-crypto module for AES XTS support has a bug that can allow requests
    greater than 4096 bytes in size to be passed to the CCP hardware. The CCP
    hardware does not support request sizes larger than 4096, resulting in
    incorrect output. The request should actually be handled by the fallback
    mechanism instantiated by the ccp-crypto module.
    
    Add a check to insure the request size is less than or equal to the maximum
    supported size and use the fallback mechanism if it is not.

    The s390 BFP compiler currently uses relative branch instructions

    etc.  Currently the maximum size of s390 BPF programs is set
    to 0x7ffff.  If branches over 64 KB are generated the, kernel can
    crash due to incorrect code.
    
    So fix this an reduce the maximum size to 64 KB. Programs larger than
    that will be interpreted.

    commit 6edf0aa4f8bbdfbb4d6d786892fa02728d05dc36 upstream.
    
    In case of usage of skb_vlan_push/pop, in the prologue we store
    the SKB pointer on the stack and restore it after BPF_JMP_CALL
    to skb_vlan_push/pop.
    
    Unfortunately currently there are two bugs in the code:
    
     1) The wrong stack slot (offset 170 instead of 176) is used
     2) The wrong register (W1 instead of B1) is saved
    
    So fix this and use correct stack slot and register.

    commit b66b2a0adf0e48973b582e055758b9907a7eee7c upstream.
    
    The bcm_kona_gpio_reset() calls bcm_kona_gpio_write_lock_regs()

    ARM: fix PTRACE_SETVFPREGS on SMP systems
    
    commit e2dfb4b880146bfd4b6aa8e138c0205407cebbaf upstream.
    
    PTRACE_SETVFPREGS fails to properly mark the VFP register set to be
    reloaded, because it undoes one of the effects of vfp_flush_hwstate().
    
    Specifically vfp_flush_hwstate() sets thread->vfpstate.hard.cpu to
    an invalid CPU number, but vfp_set() overwrites this with the original
    CPU number, thereby rendering the hardware state as apparently "valid",
    even though the software state is more recent.
    
    Fix this by reverting the previous change.

    vxlan, gre, geneve: Set a large MTU on ovs-created tunnel devices
    
    [ Upstream commit 7e059158d57b79159eaf1f504825d19866ef2c42 ]
    
    Prior to 4.3, openvswitch tunnel vports (vxlan, gre and geneve) could
    transmit vxlan packets of any size, constrained only by the ability to
    send out the resulting packets.  4.3 introduced netdevs corresponding
    to tunnel vports.  These netdevs have an MTU, which limits the size of
    a packet that can be successfully encapsulated.  The default MTU
    values are low (1500 or less), which is awkwardly small in the context
    of physical networks supporting jumbo frames, and leads to a
    conspicuous change in behaviour for userspace.
    
    Instead, set the MTU on openvswitch-created netdevs to be the relevant
    maximum (i.e. the maximum IP packet size minus any relevant overhead),
    effectively restoring the behaviour prior to 4.3.

    geneve: Relax MTU constraints
    
    [ Upstream commit 55e5bfb53cff286c1c1ff49f51325dc15c7fea63 ]
    
    Allow the MTU of geneve devices to be set to large values, in order to
    exploit underlying networks with larger frame sizes.
    
    GENEVE does not have a fixed encapsulation overhead (an openvswitch
    rule can add variable length options), so there is no relevant maximum
    MTU to enforce.  A maximum of IP_MAX_MTU is used instead.
    Encapsulated packets that are too big for the underlying network will
    get dropped on the floor.

    vxlan: Relax MTU constraints
    
    [ Upstream commit 72564b59ffc438ea103b0727a921aaddce766728 ]
    
    Allow the MTU of vxlan devices without an underlying device to be set
    to larger values (up to a maximum based on IP packet limits and vxlan
    overhead).
    
    Previously, their MTUs could not be set to higher than the
    conventional ethernet value of 1500.  This is a very arbitrary value
    in the context of vxlan, and prevented vxlan devices from being able
    to take advantage of jumbo frames etc.
    
    The default MTU remains 1500, for compatibility.

    ipv6: Skip XFRM lookup if dst_entry in socket cache is valid
    
    [ Upstream commit 00bc0ef5880dc7b82f9c320dead4afaad48e47be ]
    
    At present we perform an xfrm_lookup() for each UDPv6 message we
    send. The lookup involves querying the flow cache (flow_cache_lookup)
    and, in case of a cache miss, creating an XFRM bundle.
    
    If we miss the flow cache, we can end up creating a new bundle and
    deriving the path MTU (xfrm_init_pmtu) from on an already transformed
    dst_entry, which we pass from the socket cache (sk->sk_dst_cache) down
    to xfrm_lookup(). This can happen only if we're caching the dst_entry
    in the socket, that is when we're using a connected UDP socket.
    
    To put it another way, the path MTU shrinks each time we miss the flow
    cache, which later on leads to incorrectly fragmented payload. It can
    be observed with ESPv6 in transport mode:
    
      1) Set up a transformation and lower the MTU to trigger fragmentation
        # ip xfrm policy add dir out src ::1 dst ::1 \
          tmpl src ::1 dst ::1 proto esp spi 1
        # ip xfrm state add src ::1 dst ::1 \
          proto esp spi 1 enc 'aes' 0x0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b
        # ip link set dev lo mtu 1500
    
      2) Monitor the packet flow and set up an UDP sink
        # tcpdump -ni lo -ttt &
        # socat udp6-listen:12345,fork /dev/null &
    
      3) Send a datagram that needs fragmentation with a connected socket
        # perl -e 'print "@" x 1470 | socat - udp6:[::1]:12345
        2016/06/07 18:52:52 socat[724] E read(3, 0x555bb3d5ba00, 8192): Protocol error
        00:00:00.000000 IP6 ::1 > ::1: frag (0|1448) ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x2), length 1448
        00:00:00.000014 IP6 ::1 > ::1: frag (1448|32)
        00:00:00.000050 IP6 ::1 > ::1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x3), length 1272
        (^ ICMPv6 Parameter Problem)
        00:00:00.000022 IP6 ::1 > ::1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x5), length 136
    
      4) Compare it to a non-connected socket
        # perl -e 'print "@" x 1500' | socat - udp6-sendto:[::1]:12345
        00:00:40.535488 IP6 ::1 > ::1: frag (0|1448) ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x6), length 1448
        00:00:00.000010 IP6 ::1 > ::1: frag (1448|64)
    
    What happens in step (3) is:
    
      1) when connecting the socket in __ip6_datagram_connect(), we
         perform an XFRM lookup, miss the flow cache, create an XFRM
         bundle, and cache the destination,
    
      2) afterwards, when sending the datagram, we perform an XFRM lookup,
         again, miss the flow cache (due to mismatch of flowi6_iif and
         flowi6_oif, which is an issue of its own), and recreate an XFRM
         bundle based on the cached (and already transformed) destination.
    
    To prevent the recreation of an XFRM bundle, avoid an XFRM lookup
    altogether whenever we already have a destination entry cached in the
    socket. This prevents the path MTU shrinkage and brings us on par with
    UDPv4.
    
    The fix also benefits connected PINGv6 sockets, another user of
    ip6_sk_dst_lookup_flow(), who also suffer messages being transformed
    twice.
    
    Joint work with Hannes Frederic Sowa.

    team: don't call netdev_change_features under team->lock
    
    [ Upstream commit f6988cb63a4e698d8a62a1d085d263d1fcc351ea ]
    
    The team_device_event() notifier calls team_compute_features() to fix
    vlan_features under team->lock to protect team->port_list. The problem is
    that subsequent __team_compute_features() calls netdev_change_features()
    to propagate vlan_features to upper vlan devices while team->lock is still
    taken. This can lead to deadlock when NETIF_F_LRO is modified on lower
    devices or team device itself.
    
    Example:
    The team0 as active backup with eth0 and eth1 NICs. Both eth0 & eth1 are
    LRO capable and LRO is enabled. Thus LRO is also enabled on team0.
    
    The command 'ethtool -K team0 lro off' now hangs due to this deadlock:
    
    dev_ethtool()
    -> ethtool_set_features()
     -> __netdev_update_features(team)
      -> netdev_sync_lower_features()
       -> netdev_update_features(lower_1)
        -> __netdev_update_features(lower_1)
        -> netdev_features_change(lower_1)
         -> call_netdevice_notifiers(...)
          -> team_device_event(lower_1)
           -> team_compute_features(team) [TAKES team->lock]
            -> netdev_change_features(team)
             -> __netdev_update_features(team)
              -> netdev_sync_lower_features()
               -> netdev_update_features(lower_2)
                -> __netdev_update_features(lower_2)
                -> netdev_features_change(lower_2)
                 -> call_netdevice_notifiers(...)
                  -> team_device_event(lower_2)
                   -> team_compute_features(team) [DEADLOCK]
    
    The bug is present in team from the beginning but it appeared after the commit
    fd867d5 (net/core: generic support for disabling netdev features down stack)
    that adds synchronization of features with lower devices.

    bpf, inode: disallow userns mounts
    
    [ Upstream commit 612bacad78ba6d0a91166fc4487af114bac172a8 ]
    
    Follow-up to commit e27f4a942a0e ("bpf: Use mount_nodev not mount_ns
    to mount the bpf filesystem"), which removes the FS_USERNS_MOUNT flag.
    
    The original idea was to have a per mountns instance instead of a
    single global fs instance, but that didn't work out and we had to
    switch to mount_nodev() model. The intent of that middle ground was
    that we avoid users who don't play nice to create endless instances
    of bpf fs which are difficult to control and discover from an admin
    point of view, but at the same time it would have allowed us to be
    more flexible with regard to namespaces.
    
    Therefore, since we now did the switch to mount_nodev() as a fix
    where individual instances are created, we also need to remove userns
    mount flag along with it to avoid running into mentioned situation.
    I don't expect any breakage at this early point in time with removing
    the flag and we can revisit this later should the requirement for
    this come up with future users. This and commit e27f4a942a0e have
    been split to facilitate tracking should any of them run into the
    unlikely case of causing a regression.

    In case we find a socket with encapsulation enabled we should call

    dropping the packets.
    
    Also, in case the header validation fails for geneve and vxlan we
    shouldn't put the skb back into the socket queue, no one will pick
    them up there.  Instead we can simply discard them in the respective
    encap_recv functions.

    bpf: Use mount_nodev not mount_ns to mount the bpf filesystem
    
    [ Upstream commit e27f4a942a0ee4b84567a3c6cfa84f273e55cbb7 ]
    
    While reviewing the filesystems that set FS_USERNS_MOUNT I spotted the
    bpf filesystem.  Looking at the code I saw a broken usage of mount_ns
    with current->nsproxy->mnt_ns. As the code does not acquire a
    reference to the mount namespace it can not possibly be correct to
    store the mount namespace on the superblock as it does.
    
    Replace mount_ns with mount_nodev so that each mount of the bpf
    filesystem returns a distinct instance, and the code is not buggy.
    
    In discussion with Hannes Frederic Sowa it was reported that the use
    of mount_ns was an attempt to have one bpf instance per mount
    namespace, in an attempt to keep resources that pin resources from
    hiding.  That intent simply does not work, the vfs is not built to
    allow that kind of behavior.  Which means that the bpf filesystem
    really is buggy both semantically and in it's implemenation as it does
    not nor can it implement the original intent.
    
    This change is userspace visible, but my experience with similar
    filesystems leads me to believe nothing will break with a model of each
    mount of the bpf filesystem is distinct from all others.

    tuntap: correctly wake up process during uninit
    
    [ Upstream commit addf8fc4acb1cf79492ac64966f07178793cb3d7 ]
    
    We used to check dev->reg_state against NETREG_REGISTERED after each
    time we are woke up. But after commit 9e641bdcfa4e ("net-tun:
    restructure tun_do_read for better sleep/wakeup efficiency"), it uses
    skb_recv_datagram() which does not check dev->reg_state. This will
    result if we delete a tun/tap device after a process is blocked in the
    reading. The device will wait for the reference count which was held
    by that process for ever.
    
    Fixes this by using RCV_SHUTDOWN which will be checked during
    sk_recv_datagram() before trying to wake up the process during uninit.

    switchdev: pass pointer to fib_info instead of copy
    
    [ Upstream commit da4ed55165d41b1073f9a476f1c18493e9bf8c8e ]
    
    The problem is that fib_info->nh is [0] so the struct fib_info
    allocation size depends on number of nexthops. If we just copy fib_info,
    we do not copy the nexthops info and driver accesses memory which is not
    ours.
    
    Given the fact that fib4 does not defer operations and therefore it does
    not need copy, just pass the pointer down to drivers as it was done
    before.

    scsi_lib: correctly retry failed zero length REQ_TYPE_FS commands
    
    commit a621bac3044ed6f7ec5fa0326491b2d4838bfa93 upstream.
    
    When SCSI was written, all commands coming from the filesystem
    (REQ_TYPE_FS commands) had data.  This meant that our signal for needing
    to complete the command was the number of bytes completed being equal to
    the number of bytes in the request.  Unfortunately, with the advent of
    flush barriers, we can now get zero length REQ_TYPE_FS commands, which
    confuse this logic because they satisfy the condition every time.  This
    means they never get retried even for retryable conditions, like UNIT
    ATTENTION because we complete them early assuming they're done.  Fix
    this by special casing the early completion condition to recognise zero
    length commands with errors and let them drop through to the retry code.
