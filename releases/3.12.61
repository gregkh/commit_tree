    Bluetooth: hci_ldisc: Fix null pointer derefence in case of early data
    
    commit 84cb3df02aea4b00405521e67c4c67c2d525c364 upstream.
    
    HCI_UART_PROTO_SET flag is set before hci_uart_set_proto call. If we
    receive data from tty layer during this procedure, proto pointer may
    not be assigned yet, leading to null pointer dereference in rx method
    hci_uart_tty_receive.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by introducing HCI_UART_PROTO_READY flag in
    order to avoid any proto operation before proto opening and assignment.

    commit a75fa128236bc2fdaa5e412145cbd577e42e14c2 upstream.
    
    The error return err is not initialized for the case when pci_map_rom
    fails and no ROM can me mapped.  Fix this by setting ret to -ENODATA;
    (this is the same error value that is returned if the ROM data is

    Currently writing the attributes with "echo" will result in comparing:
    "enabled\n" with "enabled\0" and attribute is always set to false.
    
    Use the sysfs_streq() instead because it treats both NUL and

    xfs: xfs_iflush_cluster fails to abort on error
    
    commit b1438f477934f5a4d5a44df26f3079a7575d5946 upstream.
    
    When a failure due to an inode buffer occurs, the error handling
    fails to abort the inode writeback correctly. This can result in the
    inode being reclaimed whilst still in the AIL, leading to
    use-after-free situations as well as filesystems that cannot be
    unmounted as the inode log items left in the AIL never get removed.
    
    Fix this by ensuring fatal errors from xfs_imap_to_bp() result in
    the inode flush being aborted correctly.

    ext4: silence UBSAN in ext4_mb_init()
    
    commit 935244cd54b86ca46e69bc6604d2adfb1aec2d42 upstream.
    
    Currently, in ext4_mb_init(), there's a loop like the following:
    
      do {
        ...
        offset += 1 << (sb->s_blocksize_bits - i);
        i++;
      } while (i <= sb->s_blocksize_bits + 1);
    
    Note that the updated offset is used in the loop's next iteration only.
    
    However, at the last iteration, that is at i == sb->s_blocksize_bits + 1,
    the shift count becomes equal to (unsigned)-1 > 31 (c.f. C99 6.5.7(3))
    and UBSAN reports
    
      UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in fs/ext4/mballoc.c:2621:15

    Unless compilers start to do some fancy transformations (which at least
    GCC 6.0.0 doesn't currently do), the issue is of cosmetic nature only: the
    such calculated value of offset is never used again.
    
    Silence UBSAN by introducing another variable, offset_incr, holding the
    next increment to apply to offset and adjust that one by right shifting it
    by one position per loop iteration.

    ext4: fix hang when processing corrupted orphaned inode list
    
    commit c9eb13a9105e2e418f72e46a2b6da3f49e696902 upstream.
    
    If the orphaned inode list contains inode #5, ext4_iget() returns a
    bad inode (since the bootloader inode should never be referenced
    directly).  Because of the bad inode, we end up processing the inode
    repeatedly and this hangs the machine.
    
    This can be reproduced via:
    
       mke2fs -t ext4 /tmp/foo.img 100
       debugfs -w -R "ssv last_orphan 5" /tmp/foo.img
       mount -o loop /tmp/foo.img /mnt
    
    (But don't do this if you are using an unpatched kernel if you care
    about the system staying functional.  :-)
    
    This bug was found by the port of American Fuzzy Lop into the kernel
    to find file system problems[1].  (Since it *only* happens if inode #5
    shows up on the orphan list --- 3, 7, 8, etc. won't do it, it's not
    surprising that AFL needed two hours before it found it.)

    drm/fb_helper: Fix references to dev->mode_config.num_connector
    
    commit 255f0e7c418ad95a4baeda017ae6182ba9b3c423 upstream.
    
    During boot, MST hotplugs are generally expected (even if no physical
    hotplugging occurs) and result in DRM's connector topology changing.
    This means that using num_connector from the current mode configuration
    can lead to the number of connectors changing under us. This can lead to
    some nasty scenarios in fbcon:
    
    - We allocate an array to the size of dev->mode_config.num_connectors.
    - MST hotplug occurs, dev->mode_config.num_connectors gets incremented.
    - We try to loop through each element in the array using the new value
      of dev->mode_config.num_connectors, and end up going out of bounds
      since dev->mode_config.num_connectors is now larger then the array we
      allocated.
    
    fb_helper->connector_count however, will always remain consistent while
    we do a modeset in fb_helper.
    
    Note: This is just polish for 4.7, Dave Airlie's drm_connector
    refcounting fixed these bugs for real. But it's good enough duct-tape
    for stable kernel backporting, since backporting the refcounting
    changes is way too invasive.

    sunrpc: fix stripping of padded MIC tokens
    
    commit c0cb8bf3a8e4bd82e640862cdd8891400405cb89 upstream.
    
    The length of the GSS MIC token need not be a multiple of four bytes.
    It is then padded by XDR to a multiple of 4 B, but unwrap_integ_data()
    would previously only trim mic.len + 4 B. The remaining up to three
    bytes would then trigger a check in nfs4svc_decode_compoundargs(),
    leading to a "garbage args" error and mount failure:
    
    nfs4svc_decode_compoundargs: compound not properly padded!
    nfsd: failed to decode arguments!
    
    This would prevent older clients using the pre-RFC 4121 MIC format
    (37-byte MIC including a 9-byte OID) from mounting exports from v3.9+
    servers using krb5i.
    
    The trimming was introduced by commit 4c190e2f913f ("sunrpc: trim off
    trailing checksum before returning decrypted or integrity authenticated
    buffer").

    irq_move_irq() but left out checking if the IRQ is disabled. This broke
    resuming from suspend since it tries to move a (disabled) irq without
    holding the IRQ's desc->lock. Fix it by adding in a check for disabled
    IRQs.

    powerpc/book3s64: Fix branching to OOL handlers in relocatable kernel
    
    commit 8ed8ab40047a570fdd8043a40c104a57248dd3fd upstream.
    
    Some of the interrupt vectors on 64-bit POWER server processors are only
    32 bytes long (8 instructions), which is not enough for the full
    first-level interrupt handler. For these we need to branch to an
    out-of-line (OOL) handler. But when we are running a relocatable kernel,
    interrupt vectors till __end_interrupts marker are copied down to real
    address 0x100. So, branching to labels (ie. OOL handlers) outside this
    section must be handled differently (see LOAD_HANDLER()), considering
    relocatable kernel, which would need at least 4 instructions.
    
    However, branching from interrupt vector means that we corrupt the
    CFAR (come-from address register) on POWER7 and later processors as
    mentioned in commit 1707dd16. So, EXCEPTION_PROLOG_0 (6 instructions)
    that contains the part up to the point where the CFAR is saved in the
    PACA should be part of the short interrupt vectors before we branch out
    to OOL handlers.
    
    But as mentioned already, there are interrupt vectors on 64-bit POWER
    server processors that are only 32 bytes long (like vectors 0x4f00,
    0x4f20, etc.), which cannot accomodate the above two cases at the same
    time owing to space constraint. Currently, in these interrupt vectors,
    we simply branch out to OOL handlers, without using LOAD_HANDLER(),
    which leaves us vulnerable when running a relocatable kernel (eg. kdump
    case). While this has been the case for sometime now and kdump is used
    widely, we were fortunate not to see any problems so far, for three
    reasons:
    
      1. In almost all cases, production kernel (relocatable) is used for
         kdump as well, which would mean that crashed kernel's OOL handler
         would be at the same place where we end up branching to, from short
         interrupt vector of kdump kernel.
      2. Also, OOL handler was unlikely the reason for crash in almost all
         the kdump scenarios, which meant we had a sane OOL handler from
         crashed kernel that we branched to.
      3. On most 64-bit POWER server processors, page size is large enough
         that marking interrupt vector code as executable (see commit
         429d2e83) leads to marking OOL handler code from crashed kernel,
         that sits right below interrupt vector code from kdump kernel, as
         executable as well.
    
    Let us fix this by moving the __end_interrupts marker down past OOL
    handlers to make sure that we also copy OOL handlers to real address
    0x100 when running a relocatable kernel.
    
    This fix has been tested successfully in kdump scenario, on an LPAR with
    4K page size by using different default/production kernel and kdump
    kernel.
    
    Also tested by manually corrupting the OOL handlers in the first kernel
    and then kdump'ing, and then causing the OOL handlers to fire - mpe.

    PCI: Disable all BAR sizing for devices with non-compliant BARs
    
    commit ad67b437f187ea818b2860524d10f878fadfdd99 upstream.
    
    b84106b4e229 ("PCI: Disable IO/MEM decoding for devices with non-compliant
    BARs") disabled BAR sizing for BARs 0-5 of devices that don't comply with
    the PCI spec.  But it didn't do anything for expansion ROM BARs, so we
    still try to size them, resulting in warnings like this on Broadwell-EP:
    
      pci 0000:ff:12.0: BAR 6: failed to assign [mem size 0x00000001 pref]
    
    Move the non-compliant BAR check from __pci_read_base() up to
    pci_read_bases() so it applies to the expansion ROM BAR as well as
    to BARs 0-5.
    
    Note that direct callers of __pci_read_base(), like sriov_init(), will now
    bypass this check.  We haven't had reports of devices with broken SR-IOV
    BARs yet.

    cpuidle: Indicate when a device has been unregistered
    
    commit c998c07836f985b24361629dc98506ec7893e7a0 upstream.
    
    Currently the 'registered' member of the cpuidle_device struct is set
    to 1 during cpuidle_register_device. In this same function there are
    checks to see if the device is already registered to prevent duplicate
    calls to register the device, but this value is never set to 0 even on
    unregister of the device. Because of this, any attempt to call
    cpuidle_register_device after a call to cpuidle_unregister_device will
    fail which shouldn't be the case.
    
    To prevent this, set registered to 0 when the device is unregistered.

    aacraid: Fix for aac_command_thread hang
    
    commit fc4bf75ea300a5e62a2419f89dd0e22189dd7ab7 upstream.
    
    Typically under error conditions, it is possible for aac_command_thread()
    to miss the wakeup from kthread_stop() and go back to sleep, causing it
    to hang aac_shutdown.
    
    In the observed scenario, the adapter is not functioning correctly and so
    aac_fib_send() never completes (or time-outs depending on how it was
    called). Shortly after aac_command_thread() starts it performs
    aac_fib_send(SendHostTime) which hangs. When aac_probe_one
    /aac_get_adapter_info send time outs, kthread_stop is called which breaks
    the command thread out of it's hang.
    
    The code will still go back to sleep in schedule_timeout() without
    checking kthread_should_stop() so it causes aac_probe_one to hang until
    the schedule_timeout() which is 30 minutes.
    
    Fixed by: Adding another kthread_should_stop() before schedule_timeout()

    aacraid: Relinquish CPU during timeout wait
    
    commit 07beca2be24cc710461c0b131832524c9ee08910 upstream.
    
    aac_fib_send has a special function case for initial commands during
    driver initialization using wait < 0(pseudo sync mode). In this case,
    the command does not sleep but rather spins checking for timeout.This
    loop is calls cpu_relax() in an attempt to allow other processes/threads
    to use the CPU, but this function does not relinquish the CPU and so the
    command will hog the processor. This was observed in a KDUMP
    "crashkernel" and that prevented the "command thread" (which is
    responsible for completing the command from being timed out) from
    starting because it could not get the CPU.
    
    Fixed by replacing "cpu_relax()" call with "schedule()"

    MIPS: ath79: make bootconsole wait for both THRE and TEMT
    
    commit f5b556c94c8490d42fea79d7b4ae0ecbc291e69d upstream.
    
    This makes the ath79 bootconsole behave the same way as the generic 8250
    bootconsole.
    
    Also waiting for TEMT (transmit buffer is empty) instead of just THRE
    (transmit buffer is not full) ensures that all characters have been
    transmitted before the real serial driver starts reconfiguring the serial
    controller (which would sometimes result in garbage being transmitted.)
    This change does not cause a visible performance loss.
    
    In addition, this seems to fix a hang observed in certain configurations on
    many AR7xxx/AR9xxx SoCs during autoconfig of the real serial driver.
    
    A more complete follow-up patch will disable 8250 autoconfig for ath79
    altogether (the serial controller is detected as a 16550A, which is not
    fully compatible with the ath79 serial, and the autoconfig may lead to
    undefined behavior on ath79.)

    When emulating a jalr instruction with rd == $0, the code in

    always remain zeroed. This would lead to any further instructions

    context switched, at which point the value of $0 in the task context
    would be restored to the correct zero by a store in SAVE_SOME. Fix this
    by not writing to rd if it is $0.

    USB: serial: io_edgeport: fix memory leaks in probe error path
    
    commit c8d62957d450cc1a22ce3242908709fe367ddc8e upstream.
    
    URBs and buffers allocated in attach for Epic devices would never be
    deallocated in case of a later probe error (e.g. failure to allocate
    minor numbers) as disconnect is then never called.
    
    Fix by moving deallocation to release and making sure that the
    URBs are first unlinked.

    [media] usbvision: revert commit 588afcc1
    
    commit d5468d7afaa9c9e961e150f0455a14a9f4872a98 upstream.
    
    Commit 588afcc1c0e4 ("[media] usbvision fix overflow of interfaces
    array")' should be reverted, because:
    
    * "!dev->actconfig->interface[ifnum]" won't catch a case where the value
    is not NULL but some garbage. This way the system may crash later with
    GPF.
    
    * "(ifnum >= USB_MAXINTERFACES)" does not cover all the error
    conditions. "ifnum" should be compared to "dev->actconfig->
    desc.bNumInterfaces", i.e. compared to the number of "struct
    usb_interface" kzalloc()-ed, not to USB_MAXINTERFACES.
    
    * There is a "struct usb_device" leak in this error path, as there is
    usb_get_dev(), but no usb_put_dev() on this path.
    
    * There is a bug of the same type several lines below with number of
    endpoints. The code is accessing hard-coded second endpoint
    ("interface->endpoint[1].desc") which may not exist. It would be great
    to handle this in the same patch too.
    
    * All the concerns above are resolved by already-accepted commit fa52bd50
    ("[media] usbvision: fix crash on detecting device with invalid
    configuration")

    ACPI / osi: Fix an issue that acpi_osi=!* cannot disable ACPICA internal strings
    
    commit 30c9bb0d7603e7b3f4d6a0ea231e1cddae020c32 upstream.
    
    The order of the _OSI related functionalities is as follows:
    
      acpi_blacklisted()
        acpi_dmi_osi_linux()
          acpi_osi_setup()
        acpi_osi_setup()
          acpi_update_interfaces() if "!*"
          <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
      parse_args()
        __setup("acpi_osi=")
          acpi_osi_setup_linux()
            acpi_update_interfaces() if "!*"
            <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
      acpi_early_init()
        acpi_initialize_subsystem()
          acpi_ut_initialize_interfaces()
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      acpi_bus_init()
        acpi_os_initialize1()
          acpi_install_interface_handler(acpi_osi_handler)
          acpi_osi_setup_late()
            acpi_update_interfaces() for "!"
            >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
      acpi_osi_handler()
    
    Since acpi_osi_setup_linux() can override acpi_dmi_osi_linux(), the command
    line setting can override the DMI detection. That's why acpi_blacklisted()
    is put before __setup("acpi_osi=").
    
    Then we can notice the following wrong invocation order. There are
    acpi_update_interfaces() (marked by <<<<) calls invoked before
    acpi_ut_initialize_interfaces() (marked by ^^^^). This makes it impossible
    to use acpi_osi=!* correctly from OSI DMI table or from the command line.
    The use of acpi_osi=!* is meant to disable both ACPICA
    (acpi_gbl_supported_interfaces) and Linux specific strings
    (osi_setup_entries) while the ACPICA part should have stopped working
    because of the order issue.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by moving acpi_update_interfaces() to where
    it is invoked for acpi_osi=! (marked by >>>>) as this is ensured to be
    invoked after acpi_ut_initialize_interfaces() (marked by ^^^^). Linux
    specific strings are still handled in the original place in order to make
    the following command line working: acpi_osi=!* acpi_osi="Module Device".
    
    Note that since acpi_osi=!* is meant to further disable linux specific
    string comparing to the acpi_osi=!, there is no such use case in our bug
    fixing work and hence there is no one using acpi_osi=!* either from the
    command line or from the DMI quirks, this issue is just a theoretical
    issue.

    mmc: mmc: Fix partition switch timeout for some eMMCs
    
    commit 1c447116d017a98c90f8f71c8c5a611e0aa42178 upstream.
    
    Some eMMCs set the partition switch timeout too low.
    
    Now typically eMMCs are considered a critical component (e.g. because
    they store the root file system) and consequently are expected to be
    reliable.  Thus we can neglect the use case where eMMCs can't switch
    reliably and we might want a lower timeout to facilitate speedy
    recovery.
    
    Although we could employ a quirk for the cards that are affected (if
    we could identify them all), as described above, there is little
    benefit to having a low timeout, so instead simply set a minimum
    timeout.
    
    The minimum is set to 300ms somewhat arbitrarily - the examples that
    have been seen had a timeout of 10ms but were sometimes taking 60-70ms.

    ring-buffer: Prevent overflow of size in ring_buffer_resize()
    
    commit 59643d1535eb220668692a5359de22545af579f6 upstream.
    
    If the size passed to ring_buffer_resize() is greater than MAX_LONG - BUF_PAGE_SIZE
    then the DIV_ROUND_UP() will return zero.
    
    Here's the details:
    
      # echo 18014398509481980 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer_size_kb
    
    tracing_entries_write() processes this and converts kb to bytes.
    
     18014398509481980 << 10 = 18446744073709547520
    
    and this is passed to ring_buffer_resize() as unsigned long size.
    
     size = DIV_ROUND_UP(size, BUF_PAGE_SIZE);
    
    Where DIV_ROUND_UP(a, b) is (a + b - 1)/b
    
    BUF_PAGE_SIZE is 4080 and here
    
     18446744073709547520 + 4080 - 1 = 18446744073709551599
    
    where 18446744073709551599 is still smaller than 2^64
    
     2^64 - 18446744073709551599 = 17
    
    But now 18446744073709551599 / 4080 = 4521260802379792
    
    and size = size * 4080 = 18446744073709551360
    
    This is checked to make sure its still greater than 2 * 4080,
    which it is.
    
    Then we convert to the number of buffer pages needed.
    
     nr_page = DIV_ROUND_UP(size, BUF_PAGE_SIZE)
    
    but this time size is 18446744073709551360 and
    
     2^64 - (18446744073709551360 + 4080 - 1) = -3823
    
    Thus it overflows and the resulting number is less than 4080, which makes
    
      3823 / 4080 = 0
    
    an nr_pages is set to this. As we already checked against the minimum that
    nr_pages may be, this causes the logic to fail as well, and we crash the
    kernel.
    
    There's no reason to have the two DIV_ROUND_UP() (that's just result of
    historical code changes), clean up the code and fix this bug.

    ring-buffer: Use long for nr_pages to avoid overflow failures
    
    commit 9b94a8fba501f38368aef6ac1b30e7335252a220 upstream.
    
    The size variable to change the ring buffer in ftrace is a long. The
    nr_pages used to update the ring buffer based on the size is int. On 64 bit
    machines this can cause an overflow problem.
    
    For example, the following will cause the ring buffer to crash:
    
     # cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
     # echo 10 > buffer_size_kb
     # echo 8556384240 > buffer_size_kb
    
    Then you get the warning of:
    
     WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 318 at kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:1527 rb_update_pages+0x22f/0x260
    
    Which is:
    
      RB_WARN_ON(cpu_buffer, nr_removed);
    
    Note each ring buffer page holds 4080 bytes.
    
    This is because:
    
     1) 10 causes the ring buffer to have 3 pages.
        (10kb requires 3 * 4080 pages to hold)
    
     2) (2^31 / 2^10  + 1) * 4080 = 8556384240
        The value written into buffer_size_kb is shifted by 10 and then passed
        to ring_buffer_resize(). 8556384240 * 2^10 = 8761737461760
    
     3) The size passed to ring_buffer_resize() is then divided by BUF_PAGE_SIZE
        which is 4080. 8761737461760 / 4080 = 2147484672
    
     4) nr_pages is subtracted from the current nr_pages (3) and we get:
        2147484669. This value is saved in a signed integer nr_pages_to_update
    
     5) 2147484669 is greater than 2^31 but smaller than 2^32, a signed int
        turns into the value of -2147482627
    
     6) As the value is a negative number, in update_pages_handler() it is
        negated and passed to rb_remove_pages() and 2147482627 pages will
        be removed, which is much larger than 3 and it causes the warning
        because not all the pages asked to be removed were removed.

    remove directory incorrectly tries to set delete on close on non-empty directories
    
    commit 897fba1172d637d344f009d700f7eb8a1fa262f1 upstream.
    
    Wrong return code was being returned on SMB3 rmdir of
    non-empty directory.
    
    For SMB3 (unlike for cifs), we attempt to delete a directory by
    set of delete on close flag on the open. Windows clients set
    this flag via a set info (SET_FILE_DISPOSITION to set this flag)
    which properly checks if the directory is empty.
    
    With this patch on smb3 mounts we correctly return
     "DIRECTORY NOT EMPTY"
    on attempts to remove a non-empty directory.

    commit c14022bfd2eb2d2ece74a405dfbdb02a829c07bc upstream.
    
    The device which identifies itself as a "USB Keykoard" (no typo)
    with VID:PID 1a2c:0027 does not seem to be handling the reports
    initialization very well.
    
    This results in a "usb_submit_urb(ctrl) failed: -1" message from the
    kernel when connected, and a delay before its initialization. It can
    also cause the hang the system.
    
    This patch adds the  quirk for this device, which causes the delay
    to disappear. It is named as "USB Keykoard2" because the "USB Keykoard"
    already exists.

    HID: wiimote: Fix wiimote mp scale linearization
    
    commit d30596737e8e7b2f1235d7ba20592b8309e3af04 upstream.
    
    The wiimote motion plus gyros use two scales to report fast and slow
    rotation - below 440 deg/s uses 8192/440 units / deg/s, and above uses
    8192/2000 units / deg/s.
    
    Previously this driver attempted to linearize the two by scaling the fast
    rate by 18 and the slow by 9, but this results in a scale of
    8192*9/440 = ~167.564 for slow and 8192*18/2000 = 73.728 for fast.
    
    Correct the fast motion scale factor so that both report ~167.564
    units / deg/s

    HID: microsoft: Add ID for MS Wireless Comfort Keyboard
    
    commit f9a82c2054bcdebdf81a63c26a3b41197bb6070a upstream.
    
    Microsoft Wireless Comfort Keyboard has vendor specific My Favorites
    1-5 keys. Linux already supports this buttons on other MS keyboards by
    MS_ERGONOMY quirk. So apply MS_ERGONOMY quirk to USB PID 0x00e3
    (Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop Receiver 3.0A). After this
    My Favorites 1..5 keys will be reported as KEY_F14..KEY_F15 events.

    HID: usbhid: quirks for Corsair RGB keyboard & mice (K70R, K95RGB, M65RGB, K70RGB, K65RGB)
    
    commit 282bf1fe6dca4b768d6bedc14aea1b82c36241c1 upstream.
    
    These devices feature multiple interfaces/endpoints: a legacy BIOS/boot
    interface (endpoint 0x81), as well as 2 corsair-specific keyboard interfaces
    (endpoint 0x82, 0x83 IN/0x03 OUT) and an RGB LED control interface (endpoint
    0x84 IN/0x04 OUT)
    
    Because the extra 3 interfaces are not of subclass USB_INTERFACE_SUBCLASS_BOOT,
    HID_QUIRK_NOGET is not automatically set on them and a 10s timeout per-endpoint
    (30s per device) occurs initialising reports on boot.  We configure
    HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS for these devices.
    
    Additionally the left-side G1-G18 macro keys on the K95RGB generate output on
    the un-opened 0x82/0x83 endpoints which causes the keyboard to stop responding
    waiting for this event to be collected.  We enable HID_QUIRK_ALWAYS_POLL to
    prevent this situation from occurring.

    IB/security: Restrict use of the write() interface
    
    commit e6bd18f57aad1a2d1ef40e646d03ed0f2515c9e3 upstream.
    
    The drivers/infiniband stack uses write() as a replacement for
    bi-directional ioctl().  This is not safe. There are ways to
    trigger write calls that result in the return structure that
    is normally written to user space being shunted off to user
    specified kernel memory instead.
    
    For the immediate repair, detect and deny suspicious accesses to
    the write API.
    
    For long term, update the user space libraries and the kernel API
    to something that doesn't present the same security vulnerabilities
    (likely a structured ioctl() interface).
    
    The impacted uAPI interfaces are generally only available if
    hardware from drivers/infiniband is installed in the system.
    
    [js] backport to 3.12: hfi1 is not there yet (exclude), ipath is still
         there (include)
