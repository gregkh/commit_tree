    ALSA: usb-audio: Add Audient iD14 to mixer map quirk table
    
    commit df0380b9539b04c1ae8854a984098da06d5f1e67 upstream.
    
    This is a fix equivalent with the upstream commit df0380b9539b ("ALSA:
    usb-audio: Add quirk for Audient iD14"), adapted to the earlier
    kernels up to 5.14.y.  It adds the quirk entry with the old
    ignore_ctl_error flag to the usbmix_ctl_maps, instead.
    
    The original commit description says:
        Audient iD14 (2708:0002) may get a control message error that
        interferes the operation e.g. with alsactl.  Add the quirk to ignore
        such errors like other devices.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Add Schiit Hel device to mixer map quirk table
    
    commit 22390ce786c59328ccd13c329959dee1e8757487 upstream.
    
    This is a fix equivalent with the upstream commit 22390ce786c5 ("ALSA:

    earlier kernels up to 5.14.y.  It adds the quirk entry with the old
    ignore_ctl_error flag to the usbmix_ctl_maps, instead.
    
    The original patch description says:
        The Shciit Hel device responds to the ctl message for the mic capture
        switch with a timeout of -EPIPE:
    
                usb 7-2.2: cannot get ctl value: req = 0x81, wValue = 0x100, wIndex = 0x1100, type = 1
                usb 7-2.2: cannot get ctl value: req = 0x81, wValue = 0x100, wIndex = 0x1100, type = 1
                usb 7-2.2: cannot get ctl value: req = 0x81, wValue = 0x100, wIndex = 0x1100, type = 1
                usb 7-2.2: cannot get ctl value: req = 0x81, wValue = 0x100, wIndex = 0x1100, type = 1
    
        This seems safe to ignore as the device works properly with the control
        message quirk, so add it to the quirk table so all is good.

    Revert "drm/i915/gt: Propagate change in error status to children on unhold"
    
    commit ac653dd7996edf1770959e11a078312928bd7315 upstream.
    
    Propagating errors to dependent fences is broken and can lead to errors
    from one client ending up in another. In commit 3761baae908a ("Revert
    "drm/i915: Propagate errors on awaiting already signaled fences""), we
    attempted to get rid of fence error propagation but missed the case
    added in commit 8e9f84cf5cac ("drm/i915/gt: Propagate change in error
    status to children on unhold"). Revert that one too. This error was
    found by an up-and-coming selftest which triggers a reset during
    request cancellation and verifies that subsequent requests complete
    successfully.

    fine. As the changed sequence has caused sporadic issues with the GPU
    domains, just revert the change to go back to the working sequence.

    commit 59be177a909ac320e5f4b2a461ac09e20f35b2d8 upstream.
    
    This memory frequency calculated is only used to check if it is zero,
    what is not useful as it will never actually be zero.
    
    Also the calculation is wrong, we should be checking other bit to
    select the appropriate frequency multiplier while this code is stuck
    with a fixed multiplier.
    
    So here dropping it as whole.

    media: firewire: firedtv-avc: fix a buffer overflow in avc_ca_pmt()
    
    commit 35d2969ea3c7d32aee78066b1f3cf61a0d935a4e upstream.
    
    The bounds checking in avc_ca_pmt() is not strict enough.  It should
    be checking "read_pos + 4" because it's reading 5 bytes.  If the
    "es_info_length" is non-zero then it reads a 6th byte so there needs to
    be an additional check for that.
    
    I also added checks for the "write_pos".  I don't think these are
    required because "read_pos" and "write_pos" are tied together so
    checking one ought to be enough.  But they make the code easier to
    understand for me.  The check on write_pos is:
    
            if (write_pos + 4 >= sizeof(c->operand) - 4) {
    
    The first "+ 4" is because we're writing 5 bytes and the last " - 4"
    is to leave space for the CRC.
    
    The other problem is that "length" can be invalid.  It comes from
    "data_length" in fdtv_ca_pmt().

    vrf: Revert "Reset skb conntrack connection..."
    
    commit 55161e67d44fdd23900be166a81e996abd6e3be9 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 09e856d54bda5f288ef8437a90ab2b9b3eab83d1.
    
    When an interface is enslaved in a VRF, prerouting conntrack hook is
    called twice: once in the context of the original input interface, and
    once in the context of the VRF interface. If no special precausions are
    taken, this leads to creation of two conntrack entries instead of one,
    and breaks SNAT.
    
    Commit above was intended to avoid creation of extra conntrack entries
    when input interface is enslaved in a VRF. It did so by resetting
    conntrack related data associated with the skb when it enters VRF context.
    
    However it breaks netfilter operation. Imagine a use case when conntrack
    zone must be assigned based on the original input interface, rather than
    VRF interface (that would make original interfaces indistinguishable). One
    could create netfilter rules similar to these:
    
            chain rawprerouting {
                    type filter hook prerouting priority raw;
                    iif realiface1 ct zone set 1 return
                    iif realiface2 ct zone set 2 return
            }
    
    This works before the mentioned commit, but not after: zone assignment
    is "forgotten", and any subsequent NAT or filtering that is dependent
    on the conntrack zone does not work.
    
    Here is a reproducer script that demonstrates the difference in behaviour.
    
    ==========
    #!/bin/sh
    
    # This script demonstrates unexpected change of nftables behaviour
    # caused by commit 09e856d54bda5f28 ""vrf: Reset skb conntrack
    # connection on VRF rcv"
    # https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=09e856d54bda5f288ef8437a90ab2b9b3eab83d1
    #
    # Before the commit, it was possible to assign conntrack zone to a
    # packet (or mark it for `notracking`) in the prerouting chanin, raw
    # priority, based on the `iif` (interface from which the packet
    # arrived).
    # After the change, # if the interface is enslaved in a VRF, such
    # assignment is lost. Instead, assignment based on the `iif` matching
    # the VRF master interface is honored. Thus it is impossible to
    # distinguish packets based on the original interface.
    #
    # This script demonstrates this change of behaviour: conntrack zone 1
    # or 2 is assigned depending on the match with the original interface
    # or the vrf master interface. It can be observed that conntrack entry
    # appears in different zone in the kernel versions before and after
    # the commit.

    sfc: Fix reading non-legacy supported link modes
    
    commit 041c61488236a5a84789083e3d9f0a51139b6edf upstream.
    
    Everything except the first 32 bits was lost when the pause flags were
    added. This makes the 50000baseCR2 mode flag (bit 34) not appear.
    
    I have tested this with a 10G card (SFN5122F-R7) by modifying it to
    return a non-legacy link mode (10000baseCR).

    scsi: core: Put LLD module refcnt after SCSI device is released
    
    commit f2b85040acec9a928b4eb1b57a989324e8e38d3f upstream.
    
    SCSI host release is triggered when SCSI device is freed. We have to make
    sure that the low-level device driver module won't be unloaded before SCSI
    host instance is released because shost->hostt is required in the release
    handler.
    
    Make sure to put LLD module refcnt after SCSI device is released.
    
    Fixes a kernel panic of 'BUG: unable to handle page fault for address'
    reported by Changhui and Yi.
