    net: phylink: avoid resolving link state too early
    
    commit 87454b6edc1b0143fdb3d9853285477e95af74a4 upstream.
    
    During testing on Armada 388 platforms, it was found with a certain
    module configuration that it was possible to trigger a kernel oops
    during the module load process, caused by the phylink resolver being
    triggered for a currently disabled interface.
    
    This problem was introduced by changing the way the SFP registration
    works, which now can result in the sfp link down notification being
    called during phylink_create().

    sched/sysctl: Fix attributes of some extern declarations
    
    commit a9903f04e0a4ea522d959c2f287cdf0ab029e324 upstream.
    
    The definition of sysctl_sched_migration_cost, sysctl_sched_nr_migrate
    and sysctl_sched_time_avg includes the attribute const_debug. This
    attribute is not part of the extern declaration of these variables in
    include/linux/sched/sysctl.h, while it is in kernel/sched/sched.h,
    and as a result Clang generates warnings like this:
    
      kernel/sched/sched.h:1618:33: warning: section attribute is specified on redeclared variable [-Wsection]
      extern const_debug unsigned int sysctl_sched_time_avg;
                                    ^
      ./include/linux/sched/sysctl.h:42:21: note: previous declaration is here
      extern unsigned int sysctl_sched_time_avg;
    
    The header only declares the variables when CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG is defined,
    therefore it is not necessary to duplicate the definition of const_debug.
    Instead we can use the attribute __read_mostly, which is the expansion of
    const_debug when CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y is set.

    pinctrl: max77620: Use define directive for max77620_pinconf_param values
    
    commit 1f60652dd586d1b3eee7c4602892a97a62fa937a upstream.
    
    Clang warns when one enumerated type is implicitly converted to another:
    
    drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-max77620.c:56:12: warning: implicit conversion
    from enumeration type 'enum max77620_pinconf_param' to different
    enumeration type 'enum pin_config_param' [-Wenum-conversion]
                    .param = MAX77620_ACTIVE_FPS_SOURCE,
                             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    It is expected that pinctrl drivers can extend pin_config_param because
    of the gap between PIN_CONFIG_END and PIN_CONFIG_MAX so this conversion
    isn't an issue. Most drivers that take advantage of this define the
    PIN_CONFIG variables as constants, rather than enumerated values. Do the
    same thing here so that Clang no longer warns.

    netfilter: ipv6: Don't preserve original oif for loopback address
    
    commit 15df03c661cb362366ecfc3a21820cb934f3e4ca upstream.
    
    Commit 508b09046c0f ("netfilter: ipv6: Preserve link scope traffic
    original oif") made ip6_route_me_harder() keep the original oif for
    link-local and multicast packets. However, it also affected packets
    for the loopback address because it used rt6_need_strict().
    
    REDIRECT rules in the OUTPUT chain rewrite the destination to loopback
    address; thus its oif should not be preserved. This commit fixes the bug
    that redirected local packets are being dropped. Actually the packet was
    not exactly dropped; Instead it was sent out to the original oif rather
    than lo. When a packet with daddr ::1 is sent to the router, it is
    effectively dropped.

    Revert "bridge: do not add port to router list when receives query with source 0.0.0.0"
    
    commit 278e2148c07559dd4ad8602f22366d61eb2ee7b7 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 5a2de63fd1a5 ("bridge: do not add port to router list
    when receives query with source 0.0.0.0") and commit 0fe5119e267f ("net:
    bridge: remove ipv6 zero address check in mcast queries")
    
    The reason is RFC 4541 is not a standard but suggestive. Currently we
    will elect 0.0.0.0 as Querier if there is no ip address configured on
    bridge. If we do not add the port which recives query with source
    0.0.0.0 to router list, the IGMP reports will not be about to forward
    to Querier, IGMP data will also not be able to forward to dest.
    
    As Nikolay suggested, revert this change first and add a boolopt api
    to disable none-zero election in future if needed.

    net: avoid false positives in untrusted gso validation
    
    commit 9e8db5913264d3967b93c765a6a9e464d9c473db upstream.
    
    GSO packets with vnet_hdr must conform to a small set of gso_types.
    The below commit uses flow dissection to drop packets that do not.
    
    But it has false positives when the skb is not fully initialized.
    Dissection needs skb->protocol and skb->network_header.
    
    Infer skb->protocol from gso_type as the two must agree.
    SKB_GSO_UDP can use both ipv4 and ipv6, so try both.
    
    Exclude callers for which network header offset is not known.

    net: validate untrusted gso packets without csum offload
    
    commit d5be7f632bad0f489879eed0ff4b99bd7fe0b74c upstream.
    
    Syzkaller again found a path to a kernel crash through bad gso input.
    By building an excessively large packet to cause an skb field to wrap.
    
    If VIRTIO_NET_HDR_F_NEEDS_CSUM was set this would have been dropped in
    skb_partial_csum_set.
    
    GSO packets that do not set checksum offload are suspicious and rare.
    Most callers of virtio_net_hdr_to_skb already pass them to
    skb_probe_transport_header.
    
    Move that test forward, change it to detect parse failure and drop
    packets on failure as those cleary are not one of the legitimate
    VIRTIO_NET_HDR_GSO types.

    ARC: define ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN = 8
    
    commit b6835ea77729e7faf4656ca637ba53f42b8ee3fd upstream.
    
    The default value of ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN in "include/linux/slab.h" is
    "__alignof__(unsigned long long)" which for ARC unexpectedly turns out
    to be 4. This is not a compiler bug, but as defined by ARC ABI [1]
    
    Thus slab allocator would allocate a struct which is 32-bit aligned,
    which is generally OK even if struct has long long members.
    There was however potetial problem when it had any atomic64_t which
    use LLOCKD/SCONDD instructions which are required by ISA to take
    64-bit addresses. This is the problem we ran into

    The fix is to make sure slab allocations are 64-bit aligned.
    
    Do note that atomic64_t is __attribute__((aligned(8)) which means gcc
    does generate 64-bit aligned references, relative to beginning of
    container struct. However the issue is if the container itself is not
    64-bit aligned, atomic64_t ends up unaligned which is what this patch
    ensures.

    ARC: U-boot: check arguments paranoidly
    
    commit a66f2e57bd566240d8b3884eedf503928fbbe557 upstream.
    
    Handle U-boot arguments paranoidly:
     * don't allow to pass unknown tag.
     * try to use external device tree blob only if corresponding tag
       (TAG_DTB) is set.
     * don't check uboot_tag if kernel build with no ARC_UBOOT_SUPPORT.
    
    NOTE:
    If U-boot args are invalid we skip them and try to use embedded device
    tree blob. We can't panic on invalid U-boot args as we really pass
    invalid args due to bug in U-boot code.
    This happens if we don't provide external DTB to U-boot and
    don't set 'bootargs' U-boot environment variable (which is default
    case at least for HSDK board) In that case we will pass
    {r0 = 1 (bootargs in r2); r1 = 0; r2 = 0;} to linux which is invalid.
    
    While I'm at it refactor U-boot arguments handling code.

    parisc: Fix ptrace syscall number modification
    
    commit b7dc5a071ddf69c0350396b203cba32fe5bab510 upstream.
    
    Commit 910cd32e552e ("parisc: Fix and enable seccomp filter support")
    introduced a regression in ptrace-based syscall tampering: when tracer
    changes syscall number to -1, the kernel fails to initialize %r28 with
    -ENOSYS and subsequently fails to return the error code of the failed
    syscall to userspace.
    
    This erroneous behaviour could be observed with a simple strace syscall
    fault injection command which is expected to print something like this:
    
    $ strace -a0 -ewrite -einject=write:error=enospc echo hello
    write(1, "hello\n", 6) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device) (INJECTED)
    write(2, "echo: ", 6) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device) (INJECTED)
    write(2, "write error", 11) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device) (INJECTED)

    KEYS: always initialize keyring_index_key::desc_len
    
    commit ede0fa98a900e657d1fcd80b50920efc896c1a4c upstream.
    
    syzbot hit the 'BUG_ON(index_key->desc_len == 0);' in __key_link_begin()
    called from construct_alloc_key() during sys_request_key(), because the
    length of the key description was never calculated.
    
    The problem is that we rely on ->desc_len being initialized by
    search_process_keyrings(), specifically by search_nested_keyrings().
    But, if the process isn't subscribed to any keyrings that never happens.
    
    Fix it by always initializing keyring_index_key::desc_len as soon as the
    description is set, like we already do in some places.
    
    The following program reproduces the BUG_ON() when it's run as root and
    no session keyring has been installed.  If it doesn't work, try removing
    pam_keyinit.so from /etc/pam.d/login and rebooting.
    
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
        #include <keyutils.h>
    
        int main(void)
        {
                int id = add_key("keyring", "syz", NULL, 0, KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING);
    
                keyctl_setperm(id, KEY_OTH_WRITE);
                setreuid(5000, 5000);
                request_key("user", "desc", "", id);
        }

    KEYS: user: Align the payload buffer
    
    commit cc1780fc42c76c705dd07ea123f1143dc5057630 upstream.
    
    Align the payload of "user" and "logon" keys so that users of the
    keyrings service can access it as a struct that requires more than
    2-byte alignment.  fscrypt currently does this which results in the read
    of fscrypt_key::size being misaligned as it needs 4-byte alignment.
    
    Align to __alignof__(u64) rather than __alignof__(long) since in the
    future it's conceivable that people would use structs beginning with
    u64, which on some platforms would require more than 'long' alignment.

    RDMA/srp: Rework SCSI device reset handling
    
    commit 48396e80fb6526ea5ed267bd84f028bae56d2f9e upstream.
    
    Since .scsi_done() must only be called after scsi_queue_rq() has
    finished, make sure that the SRP initiator driver does not call
    .scsi_done() while scsi_queue_rq() is in progress. Although
    invoking sg_reset -d while I/O is in progress works fine with kernel
    v4.20 and before, that is not the case with kernel v5.0-rc1. This
    patch avoids that the following crash is triggered with kernel
    v5.0-rc1:

    inet_diag: fix reporting cgroup classid and fallback to priority
    
    [ Upstream commit 1ec17dbd90f8b638f41ee650558609c1af63dfa0 ]
    
    Field idiag_ext in struct inet_diag_req_v2 used as bitmap of requested
    extensions has only 8 bits. Thus extensions starting from DCTCPINFO
    cannot be requested directly. Some of them included into response
    unconditionally or hook into some of lower 8 bits.
    
    Extension INET_DIAG_CLASS_ID has not way to request from the beginning.
    
    This patch bundle it with INET_DIAG_TCLASS (ipv6 tos), fixes space
    reservation, and documents behavior for other extensions.
    
    Also this patch adds fallback to reporting socket priority. This filed
    is more widely used for traffic classification because ipv4 sockets
    automatically maps TOS to priority and default qdisc pfifo_fast knows
    about that. But priority could be changed via setsockopt SO_PRIORITY so
    INET_DIAG_TOS isn't enough for predicting class.
    
    Also cgroup2 obsoletes net_cls classid (it always zero), but we cannot
    reuse this field for reporting cgroup2 id because it is 64-bit (ino+gen).
    
    So, after this patch INET_DIAG_CLASS_ID will report socket priority
    for most common setup when net_cls isn't set and/or cgroup2 in use.

    net/mlx4_en: Force CHECKSUM_NONE for short ethernet frames
    
    [ Upstream commit 29dded89e80e3fff61efb34f07a8a3fba3ea146d ]
    
    When an ethernet frame is padded to meet the minimum ethernet frame
    size, the padding octets are not covered by the hardware checksum.
    Fortunately the padding octets are usually zero's, which don't affect
    checksum. However, it is not guaranteed. For example, switches might
    choose to make other use of these octets.
    This repeatedly causes kernel hardware checksum fault.
    
    Prior to the cited commit below, skb checksum was forced to be
    CHECKSUM_NONE when padding is detected. After it, we need to keep
    skb->csum updated. However, fixing up CHECKSUM_COMPLETE requires to
    verify and parse IP headers, it does not worth the effort as the packets
    are so small that CHECKSUM_COMPLETE has no significant advantage.
    
    Future work: when reporting checksum complete is not an option for
    IP non-TCP/UDP packets, we can actually fallback to report checksum
    unnecessary, by looking at cqe IPOK bit.

    sit: check if IPv6 enabled before calling ip6_err_gen_icmpv6_unreach()
    
    [ Upstream commit 173656accaf583698bac3f9e269884ba60d51ef4 ]
    
    If we disabled IPv6 from the kernel command line (ipv6.disable=1), we should
    not call ip6_err_gen_icmpv6_unreach(). This:
    
      ip link add sit1 type sit local 192.0.2.1 remote 192.0.2.2 ttl 1
      ip link set sit1 up
      ip addr add 198.51.100.1/24 dev sit1
      ping 198.51.100.2
    
    if IPv6 is disabled at boot time, will crash the kernel.
    
    v2: there's no need to use in6_dev_get(), use __in6_dev_get() instead,
        as we only need to check that idev exists and we are under
        rcu_read_lock() (from netif_receive_skb_internal()).

    team: avoid complex list operations in team_nl_cmd_options_set()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2fdeee2549231b1f989f011bb18191f5660d3745 ]
    
    The current opt_inst_list operations inside team_nl_cmd_options_set()
    is too complex to track:
    
        LIST_HEAD(opt_inst_list);
        nla_for_each_nested(...) {
            list_for_each_entry(opt_inst, &team->option_inst_list, list) {
                if (__team_option_inst_tmp_find(&opt_inst_list, opt_inst))
                    continue;
                list_add(&opt_inst->tmp_list, &opt_inst_list);
            }
        }
        team_nl_send_event_options_get(team, &opt_inst_list);
    
    as while we retrieve 'opt_inst' from team->option_inst_list, it could
    be added to the local 'opt_inst_list' for multiple times. The
    __team_option_inst_tmp_find() doesn't work, as the setter
    team_mode_option_set() still calls team->ops.exit() which uses
    ->tmp_list too in __team_options_change_check().
    
    Simplify the list operations by moving the 'opt_inst_list' and
    team_nl_send_event_options_get() into the nla_for_each_nested() loop so
    that it can be guranteed that we won't insert a same list entry for
    multiple times. Therefore, __team_option_inst_tmp_find() can be removed
    too.

    It was caused by SKB_GSO_CB(skb)->csum_start not set in sctp_gso_segment.
    sctp_gso_segment() calls skb_segment() with 'feature | NETIF_F_HW_CSUM',
    which causes SKB_GSO_CB(skb)->csum_start not to be set in skb_segment().
    
    For TCP/UDP, when feature supports HW_CSUM, CHECKSUM_PARTIAL will be set
    and gso_reset_checksum will be called to set SKB_GSO_CB(skb)->csum_start.
    
    So SCTP should do the same as TCP/UDP, to call gso_reset_checksum() when
    computing checksum in sctp_gso_segment.

    net: sfp: do not probe SFP module before we're attached
    
    [ Upstream commit b5bfc21af5cb3d53f9cee0ef82eaa43762a90f81 ]
    
    When we probe a SFP module, we expect to be able to call the upstream
    device's module_insert() function so that the upstream link can be
    configured.  However, when the upstream device is delayed, we currently
    may end up probing the module before the upstream device is available,
    and lose the module_insert() call.
    
    Avoid this by holding off probing the module until the SFP bus is
    properly connected to both the SFP socket driver and the upstream
    driver.

    max_mod_hdr_actions will store the max pedit action number we support and

    batman-adv: fix uninit-value in batadv_interface_tx()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4ffcbfac60642f63ae3d80891f573ba7e94a265c ]
    
    KMSAN reported batadv_interface_tx() was possibly using a
    garbage value [1]
    
    batadv_get_vid() does have a pskb_may_pull() call
    but batadv_interface_tx() does not actually make sure
    this did not fail.

    isdn: avm: Fix string plus integer warning from Clang
    
    [ Upstream commit 7afa81c55fca0cad589722cb4bce698b4803b0e1 ]
    
    A recent commit in Clang expanded the -Wstring-plus-int warning, showing
    some odd behavior in this file.
    
    drivers/isdn/hardware/avm/b1.c:426:30: warning: adding 'int' to a string does not append to the string [-Wstring-plus-int]
                    cinfo->version[j] = "\0\0" + 1;

    1 warning generated.
    
    This is equivalent to just "\0". Nick pointed out that it is smarter to
    use "" instead of "\0" because "" is used elsewhere in the kernel and
    can be deduplicated at the linking stage.

    [ Upstream commit 64254a2054611205798e6bde634639bc704573ac ]
    
    The driver currently treats static FDB entries as both static and
    sticky. This is incorrect and prevents such entries from being roamed to
    a different port via learning.
    
    Fix this by configuring static entries with ageing disabled and roaming
    enabled.
    
    In net-next we can add proper support for the newly introduced 'sticky'
    flag.

    my manual code review.
    
    To fix these possible bugs, the mutex lock "modem_info_mutex" used in
    isdn_tty_tiocmset() is added in isdn_tty_set_termios().

    net: stmmac: Fix PCI module removal leak
    
    [ Upstream commit 6dea7e1881fd86b80da64e476ac398008daed857 ]
    
    Since commit b7d0f08e9129, the enable / disable of PCI device is not
    managed which will result in IO regions not being automatically unmapped.
    As regions continue mapped it is currently not possible to remove and
    then probe again the PCI module of stmmac.
    
    Fix this by manually unmapping regions on remove callback.

    bpf: correctly set initial window on active Fast Open sender
    
    [ Upstream commit 31aa6503a15ba00182ea6dbbf51afb63bf9e851d ]
    
    The existing BPF TCP initial congestion window (TCP_BPF_IW) does not
    to work on (active) Fast Open sender. This is because it changes the
    (initial) window only if data_segs_out is zero -- but data_segs_out
    is also incremented on SYN-data.  This patch fixes the issue by
    proerly accounting for SYN-data additionally.

    scsi: isci: initialize shost fully before calling scsi_add_host()
    
    [ Upstream commit cc29a1b0a3f2597ce887d339222fa85b9307706d ]
    
    scsi_mq_setup_tags(), which is called by scsi_add_host(), calculates the
    command size to allocate based on the prot_capabilities. In the isci
    driver, scsi_host_set_prot() is called after scsi_add_host() so the command
    size gets calculated to be smaller than it needs to be.  Eventually,
    scsi_mq_init_request() locates the 'prot_sdb' after the command assuming it
    was sized correctly and a buffer overrun may occur.
    
    However, seeing blk_mq_alloc_rqs() rounds up to the nearest cache line
    size, the mistake can go unnoticed.
    
    The bug was noticed after the struct request size was reduced by commit
    9d037ad707ed ("block: remove req->timeout_list")
    
    Which likely reduced the allocated space for the request by an entire cache
    line, enough that the overflow could be hit and it caused a panic, on boot,
    at:
    
      RIP: 0010:t10_pi_complete+0x77/0x1c0
      Call Trace:
        <IRQ>
        sd_done+0xf5/0x340

        call_function_single_interrupt+0xf/0x20
        </IRQ>
    
    sd_done() would call scsi_prot_sg_count() which reads the number of
    entities in 'prot_sdb', but seeing 'prot_sdb' is located after the end of
    the allocated space it reads a garbage number and erroneously calls
    t10_pi_complete().
    
    To prevent this, the calls to scsi_host_set_prot() are moved into
    isci_host_alloc() before the call to scsi_add_host(). Out of caution, also
    move the similar call to scsi_host_set_guard().

    netfilter: nf_tables: fix leaking object reference count
    
    [ Upstream commit b91d9036883793122cf6575ca4dfbfbdd201a83d ]
    
    There is no code that decreases the reference count of stateful objects
    in error path of the nft_add_set_elem(). this causes a leak of reference
    count of stateful objects.
    
    Test commands:
       $nft add table ip filter
       $nft add counter ip filter c1
       $nft add map ip filter m1 { type ipv4_addr : counter \;}
       $nft add element ip filter m1 { 1 : c1 }
       $nft add element ip filter m1 { 1 : c1 }
       $nft delete element ip filter m1 { 1 }
       $nft delete counter ip filter c1
    
    Result:
       Error: Could not process rule: Device or resource busy
       delete counter ip filter c1
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
    At the second 'nft add element ip filter m1 { 1 : c1 }', the reference
    count of the 'c1' is increased then it tries to insert into the 'm1'. but
    the 'm1' already has same element so it returns -EEXIST.
    But it doesn't decrease the reference count of the 'c1' in the error path.
    Due to a leak of the reference count of the 'c1', the 'c1' can't be
    removed by 'nft delete counter ip filter c1'.

    mfd: mc13xxx: Fix a missing check of a register-read failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e28989d41c0eab57ec0bb156617a8757406ff8a ]
    
    When mc13xxx_reg_read() fails, "old_adc0" is uninitialized and will
    contain random value. Further execution uses "old_adc0" even when
    mc13xxx_reg_read() fails.
    The fix checks the return value of mc13xxx_reg_read(), and exits
    the execution when it fails.

    [ Upstream commit 10628e3ecf544fa2e4e24f8e112d95c37884dc98 ]
    
    This function is supposed to return zero on success or negative error
    codes on error.  Unfortunately, there is a bug so it sometimes returns
    non-zero, positive numbers on success.
    
    I noticed this bug during review and I can't test it.  It does appear
    that the return is sometimes propogated back to _regmap_read() where all
    non-zero returns are treated as failure so this may affect run time.

    KEYS: allow reaching the keys quotas exactly
    
    commit a08bf91ce28ed3ae7b6fef35d843fef8dc8c2cd9 upstream.
    
    If the sysctl 'kernel.keys.maxkeys' is set to some number n, then
    actually users can only add up to 'n - 1' keys.  Likewise for
    'kernel.keys.maxbytes' and the root_* versions of these sysctls.  But
    these sysctls are apparently supposed to be *maximums*, as per their
    names and all documentation I could find -- the keyrings(7) man page,
    Documentation/security/keys/core.rst, and all the mentions of EDQUOT
    meaning that the key quota was *exceeded* (as opposed to reached).
    
    Thus, fix the code to allow reaching the quotas exactly.

    proc, oom: do not report alien mms when setting oom_score_adj
    
    commit b2b469939e93458753cfbf8282ad52636495965e upstream.
    
    Tetsuo has reported that creating a thousands of processes sharing MM
    without SIGHAND (aka alien threads) and setting
    /proc/<pid>/oom_score_adj will swamp the kernel log and takes ages [1]
    to finish.  This is especially worrisome that all that printing is done
    under RCU lock and this can potentially trigger RCU stall or softlockup
    detector.
    
    The primary reason for the printk was to catch potential users who might
    depend on the behavior prior to 44a70adec910 ("mm, oom_adj: make sure
    processes sharing mm have same view of oom_score_adj") but after more
    than 2 years without a single report I guess it is safe to simply remove
    the printk altogether.
    
    The next step should be moving oom_score_adj over to the mm struct and
    remove all the tasks crawling as suggested by [2]

    numa: change get_mempolicy() to use nr_node_ids instead of MAX_NUMNODES
    
    commit 050c17f239fd53adb55aa768d4f41bc76c0fe045 upstream.
    
    The system call, get_mempolicy() [1], passes an unsigned long *nodemask
    pointer and an unsigned long maxnode argument which specifies the length
    of the user's nodemask array in bits (which is rounded up).  The manual
    page says that if the maxnode value is too small, get_mempolicy will
    return EINVAL but there is no system call to return this minimum value.
    To determine this value, some programs search /proc/<pid>/status for a
    line starting with "Mems_allowed:" and use the number of digits in the
    mask to determine the minimum value.  A recent change to the way this line
    is formatted [2] causes these programs to compute a value less than
    MAX_NUMNODES so get_mempolicy() returns EINVAL.
    
    Change get_mempolicy(), the older compat version of get_mempolicy(), and
    the copy_nodes_to_user() function to use nr_node_ids instead of
    MAX_NUMNODES, thus preserving the defacto method of computing the minimum
    size for the nodemask array and the maxnode argument.

    libceph: handle an empty authorize reply
    
    commit 0fd3fd0a9bb0b02b6435bb7070e9f7b82a23f068 upstream.
    
    The authorize reply can be empty, for example when the ticket used to
    build the authorizer is too old and TAG_BADAUTHORIZER is returned from
    the service.  Calling ->verify_authorizer_reply() results in an attempt
    to decrypt and validate (somewhat) random data in au->buf (most likely
    the signature block from calc_signature()), which fails and ends up in
    con_fault_finish() with !con->auth_retry.  The ticket isn't invalidated
    and the connection is retried again and again until a new ticket is
    obtained from the monitor:
    
      libceph: osd2 192.168.122.1:6809 bad authorize reply
      libceph: osd2 192.168.122.1:6809 bad authorize reply

    Let TAG_BADAUTHORIZER handler kick in and increment con->auth_retry.

    mac80211: Restore vif beacon interval if start ap fails
    
    commit 83e37e0bdd1470bbe6612250b745ad39b1a7b130 upstream.
    
    The starting of AP interface can fail due to invalid
    beacon interval, which does not match the minimum gcd
    requirement set by the wifi driver. In such case, the
    beacon interval of that interface gets updated with
    that invalid beacon interval.
    
    The next time that interface is brought up in AP mode,
    an interface combination check is performed and the
    beacon interval is taken from the previously set value.
    
    In a case where an invalid beacon interval, i.e. a beacon
    interval value which does not satisfy the minimum gcd criteria
    set by the driver, is set, all the subsequent trials to
    bring that interface in AP mode will fail, even if the
    subsequent trials have a valid beacon interval.
    
    To avoid this, in case of a failure in bringing up an
    interface in AP mode due to interface combination error,
    the interface beacon interval which is stored in bss
    conf, needs to be restored with the last working value
    of beacon interval.
    
    Tested on ath10k using WCN3990.

    ABI that MIPS64 kernels target defines that 32 bit integers should
    always be sign extended when passed in registers as either arguments or
    return values.
    
    This means that when returning any value which may not already be sign
    extended (ie. of type REG_64BIT or REG_32BIT_ZERO_EX) we need to perform
    that sign extension in order to comply with the n64 ABI. Without this we
    see strange looking test failures from test_bpf.ko, such as:
    
      test_bpf: #65 ALU64_MOV_X:
        dst = 4294967295 jited:1 ret -1 != -1 FAIL (1 times)
    
    Although the return value printed matches the expected value, this is
    only because printf is only examining the least significant 32 bits of
    the 64 bit register value we returned. The register holding the expected
    value is sign extended whilst the v0 register was set to a zero extended
    value by our JITed code, so when compared by a conditional branch
    instruction the values are not equal.
    
    We already handle this when the return value register is of type
    REG_32BIT_ZERO_EX, so simply extend this to also cover REG_64BIT.

    tracing: Fix number of entries in trace header
    
    commit 9e7382153f80ba45a0bbcd540fb77d4b15f6e966 upstream.
    
    The following commit
    
      441dae8f2f29 ("tracing: Add support for display of tgid in trace output")
    
    removed the call to print_event_info() from print_func_help_header_irq()
    which results in the ftrace header not reporting the number of entries
    written in the buffer. As this wasn't the original intent of the patch,
    re-introduce the call to print_event_info() to restore the orginal
    behaviour.

    ARM: 8834/1: Fix: kprobes: optimized kprobes illegal instruction
    
    commit 0ac569bf6a7983c0c5747d6df8db9dc05bc92b6c upstream.
    
    commit e46daee53bb5 ("ARM: 8806/1: kprobes: Fix false positive with
    FORTIFY_SOURCE") introduced a regression in optimized kprobes. It
    triggers "invalid instruction" oopses when using kprobes instrumentation
    through lttng and perf. This commit was introduced in kernel v4.20, and
    has been backported to stable kernels 4.19 and 4.14.
    
    This crash was also reported by Hongzhi Song on the redhat bugzilla
    where the patch was originally introduced.
