    dm era: Update in-core bitset after committing the metadata
    
    commit 2099b145d77c1d53f5711f029c37cc537897cee6 upstream.
    
    In case of a system crash, dm-era might fail to mark blocks as written
    in its metadata, although the corresponding writes to these blocks were
    passed down to the origin device and completed successfully.
    
    Consider the following sequence of events:
    
    1. We write to a block that has not been yet written in the current era
    2. era_map() checks the in-core bitmap for the current era and sees
       that the block is not marked as written.
    3. The write is deferred for submission after the metadata have been
       updated and committed.
    4. The worker thread processes the deferred write
       (process_deferred_bios()) and marks the block as written in the
       in-core bitmap, **before** committing the metadata.
    5. The worker thread starts committing the metadata.
    6. We do more writes that map to the same block as the write of step (1)
    7. era_map() checks the in-core bitmap and sees that the block is marked
       as written, **although the metadata have not been committed yet**.
    8. These writes are passed down to the origin device immediately and the
       device reports them as completed.
    9. The system crashes, e.g., power failure, before the commit from step
       (5) finishes.
    
    When the system recovers and we query the dm-era target for the list of
    written blocks it doesn't report the aforementioned block as written,
    although the writes of step (6) completed successfully.
    
    The issue is that era_map() decides whether to defer or not a write
    based on non committed information. The root cause of the bug is that we
    update the in-core bitmap, **before** committing the metadata.
    
    Fix this by updating the in-core bitmap **after** successfully
    committing the metadata.

    net: icmp: pass zeroed opts from icmp{,v6}_ndo_send before sending
    
    commit ee576c47db60432c37e54b1e2b43a8ca6d3a8dca upstream.
    
    The icmp{,v6}_send functions make all sorts of use of skb->cb, casting
    it with IPCB or IP6CB, assuming the skb to have come directly from the
    inet layer. But when the packet comes from the ndo layer, especially
    when forwarded, there's no telling what might be in skb->cb at that
    point. As a result, the icmp sending code risks reading bogus memory
    contents, which can result in nasty stack overflows such as this one
    reported by a user:
    
        panic+0x108/0x2ea
        __stack_chk_fail+0x14/0x20
        __icmp_send+0x5bd/0x5c0
        icmp_ndo_send+0x148/0x160
    
    In icmp_send, skb->cb is cast with IPCB and an ip_options struct is read
    from it. The optlen parameter there is of particular note, as it can
    induce writes beyond bounds. There are quite a few ways that can happen
    in __ip_options_echo. For example:
    
        // sptr/skb are attacker-controlled skb bytes
        sptr = skb_network_header(skb);
        // dptr/dopt points to stack memory allocated by __icmp_send
        dptr = dopt->__data;
        // sopt is the corrupt skb->cb in question
        if (sopt->rr) {
            optlen  = sptr[sopt->rr+1]; // corrupt skb->cb + skb->data
            soffset = sptr[sopt->rr+2]; // corrupt skb->cb + skb->data
            // this now writes potentially attacker-controlled data, over
            // flowing the stack:
            memcpy(dptr, sptr+sopt->rr, optlen);
        }
    
    In the icmpv6_send case, the story is similar, but not as dire, as only
    IP6CB(skb)->iif and IP6CB(skb)->dsthao are used. The dsthao case is
    worse than the iif case, but it is passed to ipv6_find_tlv, which does
    a bit of bounds checking on the value.
    
    This is easy to simulate by doing a `memset(skb->cb, 0x41,
    sizeof(skb->cb));` before calling icmp{,v6}_ndo_send, and it's only by
    good fortune and the rarity of icmp sending from that context that we've
    avoided reports like this until now. For example, in KASAN:
    
        BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in __ip_options_echo+0xa0e/0x12b0
        Write of size 38 at addr ffff888006f1f80e by task ping/89
        CPU: 2 PID: 89 Comm: ping Not tainted 5.10.0-rc7-debug+ #5
        Call Trace:
         dump_stack+0x9a/0xcc
         print_address_description.constprop.0+0x1a/0x160
         __kasan_report.cold+0x20/0x38
         kasan_report+0x32/0x40
         check_memory_region+0x145/0x1a0
         memcpy+0x39/0x60
         __ip_options_echo+0xa0e/0x12b0
         __icmp_send+0x744/0x1700
    
    Actually, out of the 4 drivers that do this, only gtp zeroed the cb for
    the v4 case, while the rest did not. So this commit actually removes the
    gtp-specific zeroing, while putting the code where it belongs in the
    shared infrastructure of icmp{,v6}_ndo_send.
    
    This commit fixes the issue by passing an empty IPCB or IP6CB along to
    the functions that actually do the work. For the icmp_send, this was
    already trivial, thanks to __icmp_send providing the plumbing function.
    For icmpv6_send, this required a tiny bit of refactoring to make it
    behave like the v4 case, after which it was straight forward.

    icmp: allow icmpv6_ndo_send to work with CONFIG_IPV6=n
    
    commit a8e41f6033a0c5633d55d6e35993c9e2005d872f upstream.
    
    The icmpv6_send function has long had a static inline implementation
    with an empty body for CONFIG_IPV6=n, so that code calling it doesn't
    need to be ifdef'd. The new icmpv6_ndo_send function, which is intended
    for drivers as a drop-in replacement with an identical function
    signature, should follow the same pattern. Without this patch, drivers
    that used to work with CONFIG_IPV6=n now result in a linker error.

    dm era: only resize metadata in preresume
    
    commit cca2c6aebe86f68103a8615074b3578e854b5016 upstream.
    
    Metadata resize shouldn't happen in the ctr. The ctr loads a temporary
    (inactive) table that will only become active upon resume. That is why
    resize should always be done in terms of resume. Otherwise a load (ctr)
    whose inactive table never becomes active will incorrectly resize the
    metadata.
    
    Also, perform the resize directly in preresume, instead of using the
    worker to do it.
    
    The worker might run other metadata operations, e.g., it could start
    digestion, before resizing the metadata. These operations will end up
    using the old size.
    
    This could lead to errors, like:
    
      device-mapper: era: metadata_digest_transcribe_writeset: dm_array_set_value failed
      device-mapper: era: process_old_eras: digest step failed, stopping digestion
    
    The reason of the above error is that the worker started the digestion
    of the archived writeset using the old, larger size.
    
    As a result, metadata_digest_transcribe_writeset tried to write beyond
    the end of the era array.

    dm era: Reinitialize bitset cache before digesting a new writeset
    
    commit 2524933307fd0036d5c32357c693c021ab09a0b0 upstream.
    
    In case of devices with at most 64 blocks, the digestion of consecutive
    eras uses the writeset of the first era as the writeset of all eras to
    digest, leading to lost writes. That is, we lose the information about
    what blocks were written during the affected eras.
    
    The digestion code uses a dm_disk_bitset object to access the archived
    writesets. This structure includes a one word (64-bit) cache to reduce
    the number of array lookups.
    
    This structure is initialized only once, in metadata_digest_start(),
    when we kick off digestion.
    
    But, when we insert a new writeset into the writeset tree, before the
    digestion of the previous writeset is done, or equivalently when there
    are multiple writesets in the writeset tree to digest, then all these
    writesets are digested using the same cache and the cache is not
    re-initialized when moving from one writeset to the next.
    
    For devices with more than 64 blocks, i.e., the size of the cache, the
    cache is indirectly invalidated when we move to a next set of blocks, so
    we avoid the bug.
    
    But for devices with at most 64 blocks we end up using the same cached
    data for digesting all archived writesets, i.e., the cache is loaded
    when digesting the first writeset and it never gets reloaded, until the
    digestion is done.
    
    As a result, the writeset of the first era to digest is used as the
    writeset of all the following archived eras, leading to lost writes.
    
    Fix this by reinitializing the dm_disk_bitset structure, and thus
    invalidating the cache, every time the digestion code starts digesting a
    new writeset.

    dm era: Recover committed writeset after crash
    
    commit de89afc1e40fdfa5f8b666e5d07c43d21a1d3be0 upstream.
    
    Following a system crash, dm-era fails to recover the committed writeset
    for the current era, leading to lost writes. That is, we lose the
    information about what blocks were written during the affected era.
    
    dm-era assumes that the writeset of the current era is archived when the
    device is suspended. So, when resuming the device, it just moves on to
    the next era, ignoring the committed writeset.
    
    This assumption holds when the device is properly shut down. But, when
    the system crashes, the code that suspends the target never runs, so the
    writeset for the current era is not archived.
    
    There are three issues that cause the committed writeset to get lost:
    
    1. dm-era doesn't load the committed writeset when opening the metadata
    2. The code that resizes the metadata wipes the information about the
       committed writeset (assuming it was loaded at step 1)
    3. era_preresume() starts a new era, without taking into account that
       the current era might not have been archived, due to a system crash.
    
    To fix this:
    
    1. Load the committed writeset when opening the metadata
    2. Fix the code that resizes the metadata to make sure it doesn't wipe
       the loaded writeset
    3. Fix era_preresume() to check for a loaded writeset and archive it,
       before starting a new era.

    dm: fix deadlock when swapping to encrypted device
    
    commit a666e5c05e7c4aaabb2c5d58117b0946803d03d2 upstream.
    
    The system would deadlock when swapping to a dm-crypt device. The reason
    is that for each incoming write bio, dm-crypt allocates memory that holds
    encrypted data. These excessive allocations exhaust all the memory and the
    result is either deadlock or OOM trigger.
    
    This patch limits the number of in-flight swap bios, so that the memory
    consumed by dm-crypt is limited. The limit is enforced if the target set
    the "limit_swap_bios" variable and if the bio has REQ_SWAP set.
    
    Non-swap bios are not affected becuase taking the semaphore would cause
    performance degradation.
    
    This is similar to request-based drivers - they will also block when the
    number of requests is over the limit.

    gfs2: Don't skip dlm unlock if glock has an lvb
    
    commit 78178ca844f0eb88f21f31c7fde969384be4c901 upstream.
    
    Patch fb6791d100d1 was designed to allow gfs2 to unmount quicker by
    skipping the step where it tells dlm to unlock glocks in EX with lvbs.
    This was done because when gfs2 unmounts a file system, it destroys the
    dlm lockspace shortly after it destroys the glocks so it doesn't need to
    unlock them all: the unlock is implied when the lockspace is destroyed
    by dlm.
    
    However, that patch introduced a use-after-free in dlm: as part of its
    normal dlm_recoverd process, it can call ls_recovery to recover dead
    locks. In so doing, it can call recover_rsbs which calls recover_lvb for
    any mastered rsbs. Func recover_lvb runs through the list of lkbs queued
    to the given rsb (if the glock is cached but unlocked, it will still be
    queued to the lkb, but in NL--Unlocked--mode) and if it has an lvb,
    copies it to the rsb, thus trying to preserve the lkb. However, when
    gfs2 skips the dlm unlock step, it frees the glock and its lvb, which
    means dlm's function recover_lvb references the now freed lvb pointer,
    copying the freed lvb memory to the rsb.
    
    This patch changes the check in gdlm_put_lock so that it calls
    dlm_unlock for all glocks that contain an lvb pointer.

    sparc32: fix a user-triggerable oops in clear_user()
    
    commit 7780918b36489f0b2f9a3749d7be00c2ceaec513 upstream.
    
    Back in 2.1.29 the clear_user() guts (__bzero()) had been merged
    with memset().  Unfortunately, while all exception handlers had been
    copied, one of the exception table entries got lost.  As the result,
    clear_user() starting at 128*n bytes before the end of page and
    spanning between 8 and 127 bytes into the next page would oops when
    the second page is unmapped.  It's trivial to reproduce - all
    it takes is
    
    main()
    {
            int fd = open("/dev/zero", O_RDONLY);
            char *p = mmap(NULL, 16384, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
                            MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANON, -1, 0);
            munmap(p + 8192, 8192);
            read(fd, p + 8192 - 128, 192);
    }
    
    which had been oopsing since March 1997.  Says something about
    the quality of test coverage... ;-/  And while today sparc32 port
    is nearly dead, back in '97 it had been very much alive; in fact,
    sparc64 had only been in mainline for 3 months by that point...

    cpufreq: intel_pstate: Get per-CPU max freq via MSR_HWP_CAPABILITIES if available
    
    commit 6f67e060083a84a4cc364eab6ae40c717165fb0c upstream.
    
    Currently, when turbo is disabled (either by BIOS or by the user),
    the intel_pstate driver reads the max non-turbo frequency from the
    package-wide MSR_PLATFORM_INFO(0xce) register.
    
    However, on asymmetric platforms it is possible in theory that small
    and big core with HWP enabled might have different max non-turbo CPU
    frequency, because MSR_HWP_CAPABILITIES is per-CPU scope according
    to Intel Software Developer Manual.
    
    The turbo max freq is already per-CPU in current code, so make
    similar change to the max non-turbo frequency as well.

    printk: fix deadlock when kernel panic
    
    commit 8a8109f303e25a27f92c1d8edd67d7cbbc60a4eb upstream.
    
    printk_safe_flush_on_panic() caused the following deadlock on our
    server:
    
    CPU0:                                         CPU1:
    panic                                         rcu_dump_cpu_stacks
      kdump_nmi_shootdown_cpus                      nmi_trigger_cpumask_backtrace
        register_nmi_handler(crash_nmi_callback)      printk_safe_flush
                                                        __printk_safe_flush
                                                          raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&read_lock)
        // send NMI to other processors
        apic_send_IPI_allbutself(NMI_VECTOR)
                                                            // NMI interrupt, dead loop
                                                            crash_nmi_callback
      printk_safe_flush_on_panic
        printk_safe_flush
          __printk_safe_flush
            // deadlock
            raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&read_lock)
    
    DEADLOCK: read_lock is taken on CPU1 and will never get released.
    
    It happens when panic() stops a CPU by NMI while it has been in
    the middle of printk_safe_flush().
    
    Handle the lock the same way as logbuf_lock. The printk_safe buffers
    are flushed only when both locks can be safely taken. It can avoid
    the deadlock _in this particular case_ at expense of losing contents
    of printk_safe buffers.
    
    Note: It would actually be safe to re-init the locks when all CPUs were
          stopped by NMI. But it would require passing this information
          from arch-specific code. It is not worth the complexity.
          Especially because logbuf_lock and printk_safe buffers have been
          obsoleted by the lockless ring buffer.

    gpio: pcf857x: Fix missing first interrupt
    
    commit a8002a35935aaefcd6a42ad3289f62bab947f2ca upstream.
    
    If no n_latch value will be provided at driver probe then all pins will
    be used as an input:
    
        gpio->out = ~n_latch;
    
    In that case initial state for all pins is "one":
    
        gpio->status = gpio->out;
    
    So if pcf857x IRQ happens with change pin value from "zero" to "one"
    then we miss it, because of "one" from IRQ and "one" from initial state
    leaves corresponding pin unchanged:
    change = (gpio->status ^ status) & gpio->irq_enabled;
    
    The right solution will be to read actual state at driver probe.

    module: Ignore _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ when warning for undefined symbols
    
    commit ebfac7b778fac8b0e8e92ec91d0b055f046b4604 upstream.
    
    clang-12 -fno-pic (since
    https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a084c0388e2a59b9556f2de0083333232da3f1d6)
    can emit `call __stack_chk_fail@PLT` instead of `call __stack_chk_fail`
    on x86.  The two forms should have identical behaviors on x86-64 but the
    former causes GNU as<2.37 to produce an unreferenced undefined symbol
    _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_.
    
    (On x86-32, there is an R_386_PC32 vs R_386_PLT32 difference but the
    linker behavior is identical as far as Linux kernel is concerned.)
    
    Simply ignore _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ for now, like what
    scripts/mod/modpost.c:ignore_undef_symbol does. This also fixes the
    problem for gcc/clang -fpie and -fpic, which may emit `call foo@PLT` for
    external function calls on x86.
    
    Note: ld -z defs and dynamic loaders do not error for unreferenced
    undefined symbols so the module loader is reading too much.  If we ever
    need to ignore more symbols, the code should be refactored to ignore
    unreferenced symbols.

    arm64: Extend workaround for erratum 1024718 to all versions of Cortex-A55
    
    commit c0b15c25d25171db4b70cc0b7dbc1130ee94017d upstream.
    
    The erratum 1024718 affects Cortex-A55 r0p0 to r2p0. However
    we apply the work around for r0p0 - r1p0. Unfortunately this
    won't be fixed for the future revisions for the CPU. Thus
    extend the work around for all versions of A55, to cover
    for r2p0 and any future revisions.

    hugetlb: fix copy_huge_page_from_user contig page struct assumption
    
    commit 3272cfc2525b3a2810a59312d7a1e6f04a0ca3ef upstream.
    
    page structs are not guaranteed to be contiguous for gigantic pages.  The
    routine copy_huge_page_from_user can encounter gigantic pages, yet it
    assumes page structs are contiguous when copying pages from user space.
    
    Since page structs for the target gigantic page are not contiguous, the
    data copied from user space could overwrite other pages not associated
    with the gigantic page and cause data corruption.
    
    Non-contiguous page structs are generally not an issue.  However, they can
    exist with a specific kernel configuration and hotplug operations.  For
    example: Configure the kernel with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM and
    !CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP.  Then, hotplug add memory for the area where
    the gigantic page will be allocated.

    x86: fix seq_file iteration for pat/memtype.c
    
    commit 3d2fc4c082448e9c05792f9b2a11c1d5db408b85 upstream.
    
    The memtype seq_file iterator allocates a buffer in the ->start and ->next
    functions and frees it in the ->show function.  The preferred handling for
    such resources is to free them in the subsequent ->next or ->stop function
    call.
    
    Since Commit 1f4aace60b0e ("fs/seq_file.c: simplify seq_file iteration
    code and interface") there is no guarantee that ->show will be called
    after ->next, so this function can now leak memory.
    
    So move the freeing of the buffer to ->next and ->stop.

    seq_file: document how per-entry resources are managed.
    
    commit b3656d8227f4c45812c6b40815d8f4e446ed372a upstream.
    
    Patch series "Fix some seq_file users that were recently broken".
    
    A recent change to seq_file broke some users which were using seq_file
    in a non-"standard" way ...  though the "standard" isn't documented, so
    they can be excused.  The result is a possible leak - of memory in one
    case, of references to a 'transport' in the other.
    
    These three patches:
     1/ document and explain the problem
     2/ fix the problem user in x86
     3/ fix the problem user in net/sctp
    
    This patch (of 3):
    
    Users of seq_file will sometimes find it convenient to take a resource,
    such as a lock or memory allocation, in the ->start or ->next operations.
    These are per-entry resources, distinct from per-session resources which
    are taken in ->start and released in ->stop.
    
    The preferred management of these is release the resource on the
    subsequent call to ->next or ->stop.
    
    However prior to Commit 1f4aace60b0e ("fs/seq_file.c: simplify seq_file
    iteration code and interface") it happened that ->show would always be
    called after ->start or ->next, and a few users chose to release the
    resource in ->show.
    
    This is no longer reliable.  Since the mentioned commit, ->next will
    always come after a successful ->show (to ensure m->index is updated
    correctly), so the original ordering cannot be maintained.
    
    This patch updates the documentation to clearly state the required
    behaviour.  Other patches will fix the few problematic users.

    watchdog: mei_wdt: request stop on unregister
    
    commit 740c0a57b8f1e36301218bf549f3c9cc833a60be upstream.
    
    The MEI bus has a special behavior on suspend it destroys
    all the attached devices, this is due to the fact that also
    firmware context is not persistent across power flows.
    
    If watchdog on MEI bus is ticking before suspending the firmware
    times out and reports that the OS is missing watchdog tick.
    Send the stop command to the firmware on watchdog unregistered
    to eliminate the false event on suspend.
    This does not make the things worse from the user-space perspective
    as a user-space should re-open watchdog device after
    suspending before this patch.

    following vague error without useful hint.

    floppy: reintroduce O_NDELAY fix
    
    commit 8a0c014cd20516ade9654fc13b51345ec58e7be8 upstream.
    
    This issue was originally fixed in 09954bad4 ("floppy: refactor open()
    flags handling").
    
    The fix as a side-effect, however, introduce issue for open(O_ACCMODE)
    that is being used for ioctl-only open. I wrote a fix for that, but
    instead of it being merged, full revert of 09954bad4 was performed,
    re-introducing the O_NDELAY / O_NONBLOCK issue, and it strikes again.
    
    This is a forward-port of the original fix to current codebase; the
    original submission had the changelog below:
    
    ====
    Commit 09954bad4 ("floppy: refactor open() flags handling"), as a
    side-effect, causes open(/dev/fdX, O_ACCMODE) to fail. It turns out that
    this is being used setfdprm userspace for ioctl-only open().
    
    Reintroduce back the original behavior wrt !(FMODE_READ|FMODE_WRITE)
    modes, while still keeping the original O_NDELAY bug fixed.

    x86/reboot: Force all cpus to exit VMX root if VMX is supported
    
    commit ed72736183c45a413a8d6974dd04be90f514cb6b upstream.
    
    Force all CPUs to do VMXOFF (via NMI shootdown) during an emergency
    reboot if VMX is _supported_, as VMX being off on the current CPU does
    not prevent other CPUs from being in VMX root (post-VMXON).  This fixes
    a bug where a crash/panic reboot could leave other CPUs in VMX root and
    prevent them from being woken via INIT-SIPI-SIPI in the new kernel.
    
    Fixes: d176720d34c7 ("x86: disable VMX on all CPUs on reboot")

    crypto: arm64/sha - add missing module aliases
    
    commit 0df07d8117c3576f1603b05b84089742a118d10a upstream.
    
    The accelerated, instruction based implementations of SHA1, SHA2 and
    SHA3 are autoloaded based on CPU capabilities, given that the code is
    modest in size, and widely used, which means that resolving the algo
    name, loading all compatible modules and picking the one with the
    highest priority is taken to be suboptimal.
    
    However, if these algorithms are requested before this CPU feature
    based matching and autoloading occurs, these modules are not even
    considered, and we end up with suboptimal performance.
    
    So add the missing module aliases for the various SHA implementations.

    At btrfs_copy_root(), if the call to btrfs_inc_ref() fails we end up
    returning without unlocking and releasing our reference on the extent
    buffer named "cow" we previously allocated with btrfs_alloc_tree_block().
    
    So fix that by unlocking the extent buffer and dropping our reference on

    btrfs: fix reloc root leak with 0 ref reloc roots on recovery
    
    commit c78a10aebb275c38d0cfccae129a803fe622e305 upstream.
    
    When recovering a relocation, if we run into a reloc root that has 0
    refs we simply add it to the reloc_control->reloc_roots list, and then
    clean it up later.  The problem with this is __del_reloc_root() doesn't
    do anything if the root isn't in the radix tree, which in this case it
    won't be because we never call __add_reloc_root() on the reloc_root.
    
    This exit condition simply isn't correct really.  During normal
    operation we can remove ourselves from the rb tree and then we're meant
    to clean up later at merge_reloc_roots() time, and this happens
    correctly.  During recovery we're depending on free_reloc_roots() to
    drop our references, but we're short-circuiting.
    
    Fix this by continuing to check if we're on the list and dropping
    ourselves from the reloc_control root list and dropping our reference
    appropriately.  Change the corresponding BUG_ON() to an ASSERT() that
    does the correct thing if we aren't in the rb tree.

    btrfs: abort the transaction if we fail to inc ref in btrfs_copy_root
    
    commit 867ed321f90d06aaba84e2c91de51cd3038825ef upstream.
    
    While testing my error handling patches, I added a error injection site
    at btrfs_inc_extent_ref, to validate the error handling I added was
    doing the correct thing.  However I hit a pretty ugly corruption while
    doing this check, with the following error injection stack trace:
    
    btrfs_inc_extent_ref
      btrfs_copy_root
        create_reloc_root
          btrfs_init_reloc_root
            btrfs_record_root_in_trans
              btrfs_start_transaction
                btrfs_update_inode
                  btrfs_update_time
                    touch_atime
                      file_accessed
                        btrfs_file_mmap
    
    This is because we do not catch the error from btrfs_inc_extent_ref,
    which in practice would be ENOMEM, which means we lose the extent
    references for a root that has already been allocated and inserted,
    which is the problem.  Fix this by aborting the transaction if we fail
    to do the reference modification.

    KEYS: trusted: Fix migratable=1 failing
    
    commit 8da7520c80468c48f981f0b81fc1be6599e3b0ad upstream.
    
    Consider the following transcript:
    
    $ keyctl add trusted kmk "new 32 blobauth=helloworld keyhandle=80000000 migratable=1" @u
    add_key: Invalid argument
    
    The documentation has the following description:
    
      migratable=   0|1 indicating permission to reseal to new PCR values,
                    default 1 (resealing allowed)
    
    The consequence is that "migratable=1" should succeed. Fix this by
    allowing this condition to pass instead of return -EINVAL.

    tpm_tis: Clean up locality release
    
    commit e42acf104d6e0bd7ccd2f09103d5be5e6d3c637c upstream.
    
    The current release locality code seems to be based on the
    misunderstanding that the TPM interrupts when a locality is released:
    it doesn't, only when the locality is acquired.
    
    Furthermore, there seems to be no point in waiting for the locality to
    be released.  All it does is penalize the last TPM user.  However, if
    there's no next TPM user, this is a pointless wait and if there is a
    next TPM user, they'll pay the penalty waiting for the new locality
    (or possibly not if it's the same as the old locality).
    
    Fix the code by making release_locality as simple write to release
    with no waiting for completion.

    tpm_tis: Fix check_locality for correct locality acquisition
    
    commit 3d9ae54af1d02a7c0edc55c77d7df2b921e58a87 upstream.
    
    The TPM TIS specification says the TPM signals the acquisition of locality
    when the TMP_ACCESS_REQUEST_USE bit goes to one *and* the
    TPM_ACCESS_REQUEST_USE bit goes to zero.  Currently we only check the
    former not the latter, so check both.  Adding the check on
    TPM_ACCESS_REQUEST_USE should fix the case where the locality is
    re-requested before the TPM has released it.  In this case the locality may
    get released briefly before it is reacquired, which causes all sorts of
    problems. However, with the added check, TPM_ACCESS_REQUEST_USE should
    remain 1 until the second request for the locality is granted.

    usb: musb: Fix runtime PM race in musb_queue_resume_work
    
    commit 0eaa1a3714db34a59ce121de5733c3909c529463 upstream.
    
    musb_queue_resume_work() would call the provided callback if the runtime
    PM status was 'active'. Otherwise, it would enqueue the request if the
    hardware was still suspended (musb->is_runtime_suspended is true).
    
    This causes a race with the runtime PM handlers, as it is possible to be
    in the case where the runtime PM status is not yet 'active', but the
    hardware has been awaken (PM resume function has been called).
    
    When hitting the race, the resume work was not enqueued, which probably
    triggered other bugs further down the stack. For instance, a telnet
    connection on Ingenic SoCs would result in a 50/50 chance of a
    segmentation fault somewhere in the musb code.
    
    Rework the code so that either we call the callback directly if
    (musb->is_runtime_suspended == 0), or enqueue the query otherwise.

    USB: serial: option: update interface mapping for ZTE P685M
    
    commit 6420a569504e212d618d4a4736e2c59ed80a8478 upstream.
    
    This patch prepares for qmi_wwan driver support for the device.
    Previously "option" driver mapped itself to interfaces 0 and 3 (matching
    ff/ff/ff), while interface 3 is in fact a QMI port.
    Interfaces 1 and 2 (matching ff/00/00) expose AT commands,
    and weren't supported previously at all.
    Without this patch, a possible conflict would exist if device ID was
    added to qmi_wwan driver for interface 3.
    
    Update and simplify device ID to match interfaces 0-2 directly,
    to expose QCDM (0), PCUI (1), and modem (2) ports and avoid conflict
    with QMI (3), and ADB (4).
    
    The modem is used inside ZTE MF283+ router and carriers identify it as
    such.
    Interface mapping is:
    0: QCDM, 1: AT (PCUI), 2: AT (Modem), 3: QMI, 4: ADB

    commit b5d6e7ab7fe7d186878142e9fc1a05e4c3b65eb9 upstream.
    
    After commit 77b425399f6d ("Input: i8042 - use chassis info to skip
    selftest on Asus laptops"), all modern Asus laptops have the i8042
    selftest disabled. It has done by using chassys type "10" (laptop).
    
    The Asus Zenbook Flip suffers from similar suspend/resume issues, but
    it _sometimes_ work and sometimes it doesn't. Setting noselftest makes
    it work reliably. In this case, we need to add chassis type "31"
    (convertible) in order to avoid selftest in this device.

    HID: wacom: Ignore attempts to overwrite the touch_max value from HID
    
    commit 88f38846bfb1a452a3d47e38aeab20a4ceb74294 upstream.
    
    The `wacom_feature_mapping` function is careful to only set the the
    touch_max value a single time, but this care does not extend to the
    `wacom_wac_finger_event` function. In particular, if a device sends
    multiple HID_DG_CONTACTMAX items in a single feature report, the
    driver will end up retaining the value of last item.
    
    The HID descriptor for the Cintiq Companion 2 does exactly this. It
    incorrectly sets a "Report Count" of 2, which will cause the driver
    to process two HID_DG_CONTACTCOUNT items. The first item has the actual
    count, while the second item should have been declared as a constant
    zero. The constant zero is the value the driver ends up using, however,
    since it is the last HID_DG_CONTACTCOUNT in the report.
    
        Report ID (16),
        Usage (Contact Count Maximum),  ; Contact count maximum (55h, static value)
        Report Count (2),
        Logical Maximum (10),
        Feature (Variable),
    
    To address this, we add a check that the touch_max is not already set
    within the `wacom_wac_finger_event` function that processes the
    HID_DG_TOUCHMAX item. We emit a warning if the value is set and ignore
    the updated value.
    
    This could potentially cause problems if there is a tablet which has
    a similar issue but requires the last item to be used. This is unlikely,
    however, since it would have to have a different non-zero value for
    HID_DG_CONTACTMAX earlier in the same report, which makes no sense
    except in the case of a firmware bug. Note that cases where the
    HID_DG_CONTACTMAX items are in different reports is already handled
    (and similarly ignored) by `wacom_feature_mapping` as mentioned above.

    ACPI: property: Fix fwnode string properties matching
    
    commit e1e6bd2995ac0e1ad0c2a2d906a06f59ce2ed293 upstream.
    
    Property matching does not work for ACPI fwnodes if the value of the
    given property is not represented as a package in the _DSD package
    containing it.  For example, the "compatible" property in the _DSD
    below
    
      Name (_DSD, Package () {
        ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
        Package () {
          Package () {"compatible", "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c45"}
        }
      })
    
    will not be found by fwnode_property_match_string(), because the ACPI
    code handling device properties does not regard the single value as a
    "list" in that case.
    
    Namely, fwnode_property_match_string() invoked to match a given
    string property value first calls fwnode_property_read_string_array()
    with the last two arguments equal to NULL and 0, respectively, in
    order to count the items in the value of the given property, with the
    assumption that this value may be an array.  For ACPI fwnodes, that
    operation is carried out by acpi_node_prop_read() which calls
    acpi_data_prop_read() for this purpose.  However, when the return
    (val) pointer is NULL, that function only looks for a property whose
    value is a package without checking the single-value case at all.
    
    To fix that, make acpi_data_prop_read() check the single-value
    case if its return pointer argument is NULL and modify
    acpi_data_prop_read_single() handling that case to attempt to
    read the value of the property if the return pointer is NULL
    and return 1 if that succeeds.

    blk-settings: align max_sectors on "logical_block_size" boundary
    
    commit 97f433c3601a24d3513d06f575a389a2ca4e11e4 upstream.
    
    We get I/O errors when we run md-raid1 on the top of dm-integrity on the
    top of ramdisk.
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0xff00, 0xff
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0xff00, 0xff
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0xffff, 0x1
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0xffff, 0x1
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0x8048, 0xff
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0x8147, 0xff
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0x8246, 0xff
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0x8345, 0xbb
    
    The ramdisk device has logical_block_size 512 and max_sectors 255. The
    dm-integrity device uses logical_block_size 4096 and it doesn't affect the
    "max_sectors" value - thus, it inherits 255 from the ramdisk. So, we have
    a device with max_sectors not aligned on logical_block_size.
    
    The md-raid device sees that the underlying leg has max_sectors 255 and it
    will split the bios on 255-sector boundary, making the bios unaligned on
    logical_block_size.
    
    In order to fix the bug, we round down max_sectors to logical_block_size.

    mm/rmap: fix potential pte_unmap on an not mapped pte
    
    [ Upstream commit 5d5d19eda6b0ee790af89c45e3f678345be6f50f ]
    
    For PMD-mapped page (usually THP), pvmw->pte is NULL.  For PTE-mapped THP,
    pvmw->pte is mapped.  But for HugeTLB pages, pvmw->pte is not mapped and
    set to the relevant page table entry.  So in page_vma_mapped_walk_done(),
    we may do pte_unmap() for HugeTLB pte which is not mapped.  Fix this by
    checking pvmw->page against PageHuge before trying to do pte_unmap().

    arm64: Add missing ISB after invalidating TLB in __primary_switch
    
    [ Upstream commit 9d41053e8dc115c92b8002c3db5f545d7602498b ]
    
    Although there has been a bit of back and forth on the subject, it
    appears that invalidating TLBs requires an ISB instruction when FEAT_ETS
    is not implemented by the CPU.
    
    From the bible:
    
      | In an implementation that does not implement FEAT_ETS, a TLB
      | maintenance instruction executed by a PE, PEx, can complete at any
      | time after it is issued, but is only guaranteed to be finished for a
      | PE, PEx, after the execution of DSB by the PEx followed by a Context
      | synchronization event
    
    Add the missing ISB in __primary_switch, just in case.

    i40e: Fix flow for IPv6 next header (extension header)
    
    [ Upstream commit 92c6058024e87087cf1b99b0389d67c0a886360e ]
    
    When a packet contains an IPv6 header with next header which is
    an extension header and not a protocol one, the kernel function
    skb_transport_header called with such sk_buff will return a
    pointer to the extension header and not to the TCP one.
    
    The above explained call caused a problem with packet processing
    for skb with encapsulation for tunnel with I40E_TX_CTX_EXT_IP_IPV6.
    The extension header was not skipped at all.
    
    The ipv6_skip_exthdr function does check if next header of the IPV6
    header is an extension header and doesn't modify the l4_proto pointer
    if it points to a protocol header value so its safe to omit the
    comparison of exthdr and l4.hdr pointers. The ipv6_skip_exthdr can
    return value -1. This means that the skipping process failed
    and there is something wrong with the packet so it will be dropped.

    regmap: sdw: use _no_pm functions in regmap_read/write
    
    [ Upstream commit d288a5712ef961e16d588bbdb2d846e00b5ef154 ]
    
    sdw_update_slave_status will be invoked when a codec is attached,
    and the codec driver will initialize the codec with regmap functions
    while the codec device is pm_runtime suspended.
    
    regmap routines currently rely on regular SoundWire IO functions,
    which will call pm_runtime_get_sync()/put_autosuspend.
    
    This causes a deadlock where the resume routine waits for an
    initialization complete signal that while the initialization complete
    can only be reached when the resume completes.
    
    The only solution if we allow regmap functions to be used in resume
    operations as well as during codec initialization is to use _no_pm
    routines. The duty of making sure the bus is operational needs to be
    handled above the regmap level.

    ext4: fix potential htree index checksum corruption
    
    [ Upstream commit b5776e7524afbd4569978ff790864755c438bba7 ]
    
    In the case where we need to do an interior node split, and
    immediately afterwards, we are unable to allocate a new directory leaf
    block due to ENOSPC, the directory index checksum's will not be filled
    in correctly (and indeed, will not be correctly journalled).
    
    This looks like a bug that was introduced when we added largedir
    support.  The original code doesn't make any sense (and should have
    been caught in code review), but it was hidden because most of the
    time, the index node checksum will be set by do_split().  But if
    do_split bails out due to ENOSPC, then ext4_handle_dirty_dx_node()
    won't get called, and so the directory index checksum field will not
    get set, leading to:
    
    EXT4-fs error (device sdb): dx_probe:858: inode #6635543: block 4022: comm nfsd: Directory index failed checksum

    Remove comparisons with PCIBIOS_SUCCESSFUL and check only for non-zero.  It
    happens that PCIBIOS_SUCCESSFUL is zero, so this is not a functional
    change, but it aligns this code with the user accessors.

    the clock and before jumping to an error handler that also unprepares
    it. This is likely to produce warnings from the kernel about the clock
    being unprepared when it is still enabled, and then being unprepared when
    it has already been unprepared.

    perf test: Fix unaligned access in sample parsing test
    
    [ Upstream commit c5c97cadd7ed13381cb6b4bef5c841a66938d350 ]
    
    The ubsan reported the following error.  It was because sample's raw
    data missed u32 padding at the end.  So it broke the alignment of the
    array after it.
    
    The raw data contains an u32 size prefix so the data size should have
    an u32 padding after 8-byte aligned data.

    clk: qcom: gcc-msm8998: Fix Alpha PLL type for all GPLLs
    
    [ Upstream commit 292f75ecff07e8a07fe2e3e19b4b567d0b698842 ]
    
    All of the GPLLs in the MSM8998 Global Clock Controller are Fabia PLLs
    and not generic alphas: this was producing bad effects over the entire
    clock tree of MSM8998, where any GPLL child clock was declaring a false
    clock rate, due to their parent also showing the same.
    
    The issue resides in the calculation of the clock rate for the specific
    Alpha PLL type, where Fabia has a different register layout; switching
    the MSM8998 GPLLs to the correct Alpha Fabia PLL type fixes the rate
    (calculation) reading. While at it, also make these PLLs fixed since
    their rate is supposed to *never* be changed while the system runs, as
    this would surely crash the entire SoC.
    
    Now all the children of all the PLLs are also complying with their
    specified clock table and system stability is improved.

    [ Upstream commit 768d70e19ba525debd571b36e6d0ab19956c63d7 ]
    
    dlpar_configure_connector() has two problems in its handling of
    ibm,configure-connector's return status:
    
    1. When the status is -2 (busy, call again), we call
       ibm,configure-connector again immediately without checking whether
       to schedule, which can result in monopolizing the CPU.
    2. Extended delay status (9900..9905) goes completely unhandled,
       causing the configuration to unnecessarily terminate.
    
    Fix both of these issues by using rtas_busy_delay().

    perf tools: Fix DSO filtering when not finding a map for a sampled address
    
    [ Upstream commit c69bf11ad3d30b6bf01cfa538ddff1a59467c734 ]
    
    When we lookup an address and don't find a map we should filter that
    sample if the user specified a list of --dso entries to filter on, fix
    it.
    
    Before:
    
      $ perf script
                 sleep 274800  2843.556162:          1 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb26bff4 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556168:          1 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb2b047d [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556171:          1 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb2706b2 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556174:          6 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb2b0267 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556176:         59 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb2b03b1 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556180:        691 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb26bff4 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556189:       9160 cycles:u:      7fa9550eeaa3 __GI___tunables_init+0xf3 (/usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so)
                 sleep 274800  2843.556312:      86937 cycles:u:      7fa9550e157b _dl_lookup_symbol_x+0x4b (/usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so)
      $
    
    So we have some samples we somehow didn't find in a map for, if we now
    do:
    
      $ perf report --stdio --dso /usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so
      # dso: /usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so
      #
      # Total Lost Samples: 0
      #
      # Samples: 8  of event 'cycles:u'
      # Event count (approx.): 96856
      #
      # Overhead  Command  Symbol
      # ........  .......  ........................
      #
          89.76%  sleep    [.] _dl_lookup_symbol_x
           9.46%  sleep    [.] __GI___tunables_init
           0.71%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb26bff4
           0.06%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb2b03b1
           0.01%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb2b0267
           0.00%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb2706b2
           0.00%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb2b047d
      $
    
    After this patch we get the right output with just entries for the DSOs
    specified in --dso:
    
      $ perf report --stdio --dso /usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so
      # dso: /usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so

    tracepoint: Do not fail unregistering a probe due to memory failure
    
    [ Upstream commit befe6d946551d65cddbd32b9cb0170b0249fd5ed ]
    
    The list of tracepoint callbacks is managed by an array that is protected
    by RCU. To update this array, a new array is allocated, the updates are
    copied over to the new array, and then the list of functions for the
    tracepoint is switched over to the new array. After a completion of an RCU
    grace period, the old array is freed.
    
    This process happens for both adding a callback as well as removing one.
    But on removing a callback, if the new array fails to be allocated, the
    callback is not removed, and may be used after it is freed by the clients
    of the tracepoint.
    
    There's really no reason to fail if the allocation for a new array fails
    when removing a function. Instead, the function can simply be replaced by a

      a stub function with no parameters or return, can be called by a location
      that thinks it has parameters but still no return value. Static calls
      do the same thing, so this trick is not without precedent.
    
      There's another solution that uses RCU tricks and is more complex, but

    amba: Fix resource leak for drivers without .remove
    
    [ Upstream commit de5d7adb89367bbc87b4e5ce7afe7ae9bd86dc12 ]
    
    Consider an amba driver with a .probe but without a .remove callback (e.g.
    pl061_gpio_driver). The function amba_probe() is called to bind a device
    and so dev_pm_domain_attach() and others are called. As there is no remove
    callback amba_remove() isn't called at unbind time however and so calling
    dev_pm_domain_detach() is missed and the pm domain keeps active.
    
    To fix this always use the core driver callbacks and handle missing amba
    callbacks there. For probe refuse registration as a driver without probe
    doesn't make sense.

    ARM: 9046/1: decompressor: Do not clear SCTLR.nTLSMD for ARMv7+ cores
    
    [ Upstream commit 2acb909750431030b65a0a2a17fd8afcbd813a84 ]
    
    It was observed that decompressor running on hardware implementing ARM v8.2
    Load/Store Multiple Atomicity and Ordering Control (LSMAOC), say, as guest,
    would stuck just after:
    
    Uncompressing Linux... done, booting the kernel.
    
    The reason is that it clears nTLSMD bit when disabling caches:
    
      nTLSMD, bit [3]
    
      When ARMv8.2-LSMAOC is implemented:
    
        No Trap Load Multiple and Store Multiple to
        Device-nGRE/Device-nGnRE/Device-nGnRnE memory.
    
        0b0 All memory accesses by A32 and T32 Load Multiple and Store
            Multiple at EL1 or EL0 that are marked at stage 1 as
            Device-nGRE/Device-nGnRE/Device-nGnRnE memory are trapped and
            generate a stage 1 Alignment fault.
    
        0b1 All memory accesses by A32 and T32 Load Multiple and Store
            Multiple at EL1 or EL0 that are marked at stage 1 as
            Device-nGRE/Device-nGnRE/Device-nGnRnE memory are not trapped.
    
      This bit is permitted to be cached in a TLB.
    
      This field resets to 1.
    
      Otherwise:
    
      Reserved, RES1
    
    So as effect we start getting traps we are not quite ready for.
    
    Looking into history it seems that mask used for SCTLR clear came from
    the similar code for ARMv4, where bit[3] is the enable/disable bit for
    the write buffer. That not applicable to ARMv7 and onwards, so retire
    that bit from the masks.

    certs: Fix blacklist flag type confusion
    
    [ Upstream commit 4993e1f9479a4161fd7d93e2b8b30b438f00cb0f ]
    
    KEY_FLAG_KEEP is not meant to be passed to keyring_alloc() or key_alloc(),
    as these only take KEY_ALLOC_* flags.  KEY_FLAG_KEEP has the same value as
    KEY_ALLOC_BYPASS_RESTRICTION, but fortunately only key_create_or_update()
    uses it.  LSMs using the key_alloc hook don't check that flag.
    
    KEY_FLAG_KEEP is then ignored but fortunately (again) the root user cannot
    write to the blacklist keyring, so it is not possible to remove a key/hash
    from it.
    
    Fix this by adding a KEY_ALLOC_SET_KEEP flag that tells key_alloc() to set
    KEY_FLAG_KEEP on the new key.  blacklist_init() can then, correctly, pass
    this to keyring_alloc().
    
    We can also use this in ima_mok_init() rather than setting the flag
    manually.
    
    Note that this doesn't fix an observable bug with the current
    implementation but it is required to allow addition of new hashes to the
    blacklist in the future without making it possible for them to be removed.

    of/fdt: Make sure no-map does not remove already reserved regions
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a5a75e5e9e55de1cef5d83ca3589cb4899193ef ]
    
    If the device tree is incorrectly configured, and attempts to
    define a "no-map" reserved memory that overlaps with the kernel
    data/code, the kernel would crash quickly after boot, with no
    obvious clue about the nature of the issue.
    
    For example, this would happen if we have the kernel mapped at
    these addresses (from /proc/iomem):
    40000000-41ffffff : System RAM
      40080000-40dfffff : Kernel code
      40e00000-411fffff : reserved
      41200000-413e0fff : Kernel data
    
    And we declare a no-map shared-dma-pool region at a fixed address
    within that range:
    mem_reserved: mem_region {
            compatible = "shared-dma-pool";
            reg = <0 0x40000000 0 0x01A00000>;
            no-map;
    };
    
    To fix this, when removing memory regions at early boot (which is
    what "no-map" regions do), we need to make sure that the memory
    is not already reserved. If we do, __reserved_mem_reserve_reg
    will throw an error:
    [    0.000000] OF: fdt: Reserved memory: failed to reserve memory
       for node 'mem_region': base 0x0000000040000000, size 26 MiB
    and the code that will try to use the region should also fail,
    later on.
    
    We do not do anything for non-"no-map" regions, as memblock
    explicitly allows reserved regions to overlap, and the commit
    that this fixes removed the check for that precise reason.

    [ Upstream commit 035b73b2b3b2e074a56489a7bf84b6a8012c0e0d ]
    
    On Intel Tangier B0 and Anniedale the interrupt line, disregarding
    to have different numbers, is shared between HSU DMA and UART IPs.
    Thus on such SoCs we are expecting that IRQ handler is called in
    UART driver only. hsu_pci_irq was handling the spurious interrupt
    from HSU DMA by returning immediately. This wastes CPU time and
    since HSU DMA and HSU UART interrupt occur simultaneously they race
    to be handled causing delay to the HSU UART interrupt handling.
    Fix this by disabling the interrupt entirely.

    [ Upstream commit a0312af1f94d13800e63a7d0a66e563582e39aec ]
    
    Prevent invalid (0, 0) inputs to hid-core's snto32() function.
    
    Maybe it is just the dummy device here that is causing this, but
    there are hundreds of calls to snto32(0, 0). Having n (bits count)
    of 0 is causing the current UBSAN trap with a shift value of
    0xffffffff (-1, or n - 1 in this function).
    
    Either of the value to shift being 0 or the bits count being 0 can be
    handled by just returning 0 to the caller, avoiding the following
    complex shift + OR operations:
    
            return value & (1 << (n - 1)) ? value | (~0U << n) : value;

    and the node is deleted.  In the corner case when a
    JFFS2_FEATURE_RWCOMPAT_COPY is seen, a call is made to
    jffs2_sum_disable_collecting().  jffs2_sum_disable_collecting() deletes
    the whole list which conflicts with the loop's deleting the list by parts.
    
    To preserve the old behavior of stopping the write midway, bail out of
    the loop after disabling summary collection.

    fs/jfs: fix potential integer overflow on shift of a int
    
    [ Upstream commit 4208c398aae4c2290864ba15c3dab7111f32bec1 ]
    
    The left shift of int 32 bit integer constant 1 is evaluated using 32 bit
    arithmetic and then assigned to a signed 64 bit integer. In the case where
    l2nb is 32 or more this can lead to an overflow.  Avoid this by shifting
    the value 1LL instead.

    [ Upstream commit e3fa4b747f085d2cda09bba0533b86fa76038635 ]
    
    When channel->device_obj is non-NULL, vmbus_onoffer_rescind() could
    invoke put_device(), that will eventually release the device and free
    the channel object (cf. vmbus_device_release()).  However, a pointer
    to the object is dereferenced again later to load the primary_channel.
    The use-after-free can be avoided by noticing that this load/check is
    redundant if device_obj is non-NULL: primary_channel must be NULL if
    device_obj is non-NULL, cf. vmbus_add_channel_work().

    The root cause is:
    If we open file w/ readonly flag, disk quota info won't be initialized
    for this file, however, following mmap() will force to convert inline
    inode via f2fs_convert_inline_inode(), which may increase block usage
    for this inode w/o updating quota data, it causes inconsistent disk quota
    info.
    
    The issue will happen in following stack:
    open(file, O_RDONLY)
    mmap(file)
    - f2fs_convert_inline_inode
     - f2fs_convert_inline_page
      - f2fs_reserve_block
       - f2fs_reserve_new_block
        - f2fs_reserve_new_blocks
         - f2fs_i_blocks_write
          - dquot_claim_block
    inode->i_blocks increase, but the dqb_curspace keep the size for the dquots
    is NULL.
    
    To fix this issue, let's call dquot_initialize() anyway in both
    f2fs_truncate() and f2fs_convert_inline_inode() functions to avoid potential
    inconsistent quota data issue.

    ASoC: cpcap: fix microphone timeslot mask
    
    [ Upstream commit de5bfae2fd962a9da99f56382305ec7966a604b9 ]
    
    The correct mask is 0x1f8 (Bit 3-8), but due to missing BIT() 0xf (Bit
    0-3) was set instead. This means setting of CPCAP_BIT_MIC1_RX_TIMESLOT0
    (Bit 3) still worked (part of both masks). On the other hand the code
    does not properly clear the other MIC timeslot bits. I think this
    is not a problem, since they are probably initialized to 0 and not
    touched by the driver anywhere else. But the mask also contains some
    wrong bits, that will be cleared. Bit 0 (CPCAP_BIT_SMB_CDC) should be
    safe, since the driver enforces it to be 0 anyways.
    
    Bit 1-2 are CPCAP_BIT_FS_INV and CPCAP_BIT_CLK_INV. This means enabling
    audio recording forces the codec into SND_SOC_DAIFMT_NB_NF mode, which
    is obviously bad.
    
    The bug probably remained undetected, because there are not many use
    cases for routing microphone to the CPU on platforms using cpcap and
    user base is small. I do remember having some issues with bad sound
    quality when testing voice recording back when I wrote the driver.
    It probably was this bug.

    The device otherwise operates correctly, but the driver rejects the

    media: lmedm04: Fix misuse of comma
    
    [ Upstream commit 59a3e78f8cc33901fe39035c1ab681374bba95ad ]
    
    There's a comma used instead of a semicolon that causes multiple
    statements to be executed after an if instead of just the intended
    single statement.
    
    Replace the comma with a semicolon.

    drm/amd/display: Fix 10/12 bpc setup in DCE output bit depth reduction.
    
    [ Upstream commit 1916866dfa4aaceba1a70db83fde569387649d93 ]
    
    In set_clamp(), the comments and definitions for the COLOR_DEPTH_101010
    and COLOR_DEPTH_121212 cases directly contradict the code comment which
    explains how this should work, whereas the COLOR_DEPTH_888 case
    is consistent with the code comments. Comment says the bitmask should
    be chosen to align to the top-most 10 or 12 MSB's on a 14 bit bus, but
    the implementation contradicts that: 10 bit case sets a mask for 12 bpc
    clamping, whereas 12 bit case sets a mask for 14 bpc clamping.
    
    Note that during my limited testing on DCE-8.3 (HDMI deep color)
    and DCE-11.2 (DP deep color), this didn't have any obvious ill
    effects, neither did fixing it change anything obvious for the
    better, so this fix may be inconsequential on DCE, and just
    reduce the confusion of innocent bystanders when reading the code
    and trying to investigate problems with 10 bpc+ output.

    crypto: bcm - Rename struct device_private to bcm_device_private
    
    [ Upstream commit f7f2b43eaf6b4cfe54c75100709be31d5c4b52c8 ]
    
    Renaming 'struct device_private' to 'struct bcm_device_private',
    because it clashes with 'struct device_private' from
    'drivers/base/base.h'.
    
    While it's not a functional problem, it's causing two distinct
    type hierarchies in BTF data. It also breaks build with options:

    The driver currently reports a single supported value for

    crypto: sun4i-ss - fix kmap usage
    
    [ Upstream commit 9bc3dd24e7dccd50757db743a3635ad5b0497e6e ]
    
    With the recent kmap change, some tests which were conditional on
    CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM now are enabled by default.
    This permit to detect a problem in sun4i-ss usage of kmap.
    
    sun4i-ss uses two kmap via sg_miter (one for input, one for output), but
    using two kmap at the same time is hard:
    "the ordering has to be correct and with sg_miter that's probably hard to get
    right." (quoting Tlgx)
    
    So the easiest solution is to never have two sg_miter/kmap open at the same time.
    After each use of sg_miter, I store the current index, for being able to
    resume sg_miter to the right place.

    [ Upstream commit c6c90c70db4d9a0989111d6b994d545659410f7a ]
    
    It looks like SPARC64 requires FB_ATY_CT to build without errors,
    so have FB_ATY select FB_ATY_CT if both SPARC64 and PCI are enabled
    instead of using "default y if SPARC64 && PCI", which is not strong
    enough to prevent build errors.

    net: mvneta: Remove per-cpu queue mapping for Armada 3700
    
    [ Upstream commit cf9bf871280d9e0a8869d98c2602d29caf69dfa3 ]
    
    According to Errata #23 "The per-CPU GbE interrupt is limited to Core
    0", we can't use the per-cpu interrupt mechanism on the Armada 3700
    familly.
    
    This is correctly checked for RSS configuration, but the initial queue

    net: amd-xgbe: Fix network fluctuations when using 1G BELFUSE SFP
    
    [ Upstream commit 9eab3fdb419916f66a72d1572f68d82cd9b3f963 ]
    
    Frequent link up/down events can happen when a Bel Fuse SFP part is
    connected to the amd-xgbe device. Try to avoid the frequent link
    issues by resetting the PHY as documented in Bel Fuse SFP datasheets.

    net: amd-xgbe: Reset link when the link never comes back
    
    [ Upstream commit 84fe68eb67f9499309cffd97c1ba269de125ff14 ]
    
    Normally, auto negotiation and reconnect should be automatically done by
    the hardware. But there seems to be an issue where auto negotiation has
    to be restarted manually. This happens because of link training and so
    even though still connected to the partner the link never "comes back".
    This needs an auto-negotiation restart.
    
    Also, a change in xgbe-mdio is needed to get ethtool to recognize the
    link down and get the link change message. This change is only
    required in a backplane connection mode.

    [ Upstream commit 186edbb510bd60e748f93975989ccba25ee99c50 ]
    
    The current driver calls netif_carrier_off() late in the link tear down

    tcp: fix SO_RCVLOWAT related hangs under mem pressure
    
    [ Upstream commit f969dc5a885736842c3511ecdea240fbb02d25d9 ]
    
    While commit 24adbc1676af ("tcp: fix SO_RCVLOWAT hangs with fat skbs")
    fixed an issue vs too small sk_rcvbuf for given sk_rcvlowat constraint,
    it missed to address issue caused by memory pressure.
    
    1) If we are under memory pressure and socket receive queue is empty.
    First incoming packet is allowed to be queued, after commit
    76dfa6082032 ("tcp: allow one skb to be received per socket under memory pressure")
    
    But we do not send EPOLLIN yet, in case tcp_data_ready() sees sk_rcvlowat
    is bigger than skb length.
    
    2) Then, when next packet comes, it is dropped, and we directly
    call sk->sk_data_ready().
    
    3) If application is using poll(), tcp_poll() will then use
    tcp_stream_is_readable() and decide the socket receive queue is
    not yet filled, so nothing will happen.
    
    Even when sender retransmits packets, phases 2) & 3) repeat
    and flow is effectively frozen, until memory pressure is off.
    
    Fix is to consider tcp_under_memory_pressure() to take care
    of global memory pressure or memcg pressure.

    bpf: Fix bpf_fib_lookup helper MTU check for SKB ctx
    
    [ Upstream commit 2c0a10af688c02adcf127aad29e923e0056c6b69 ]
    
    BPF end-user on Cilium slack-channel (Carlo Carraro) wants to use
    bpf_fib_lookup for doing MTU-check, but *prior* to extending packet size,
    by adjusting fib_params 'tot_len' with the packet length plus the expected
    encap size. (Just like the bpf_check_mtu helper supports). He discovered
    that for SKB ctx the param->tot_len was not used, instead skb->len was used
    (via MTU check in is_skb_forwardable() that checks against netdev MTU).
    
    Fix this by using fib_params 'tot_len' for MTU check. If not provided (e.g.
    zero) then keep existing TC behaviour intact. Notice that 'tot_len' for MTU
    check is done like XDP code-path, which checks against FIB-dst MTU.
    
    V16:
    - Revert V13 optimization, 2nd lookup is against egress/resulting netdev
    
    V13:
    - Only do ifindex lookup one time, calling dev_get_by_index_rcu().
    
    V10:
    - Use same method as XDP for 'tot_len' MTU check

    The "REG_READ(ah, AR_PHY_AGC_CONTROL)" in ath9k_hw_loadnf() does not
    like being called when the hardware is asleep, leading to this crash.
    
    The easiest way to reproduce this is trying to set nf_override while
    the hardware is down:
    
      $ ip link set down dev wlan0
      $ echo "-85" > /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/ath9k/nf_override
    
    Fixing this crash by waking the hardware up before trying to set the
    noise floor. Similar to what other ath9k debugfs files do.
    
    Tested on a Lima board from 8devices, which has a QCA 4531 chipset.

    bpf_lru_list: Read double-checked variable once without lock
    
    [ Upstream commit 6df8fb83301d68ea0a0c0e1cbcc790fcc333ed12 ]
    
    For double-checked locking in bpf_common_lru_push_free(), node->type is
    read outside the critical section and then re-checked under the lock.
    However, concurrent writes to node->type result in data races.
    
    For example, the following concurrent access was observed by KCSAN:
    
      write to 0xffff88801521bc22 of 1 bytes by task 10038 on cpu 1:
       __bpf_lru_node_move_in        kernel/bpf/bpf_lru_list.c:91
       __local_list_flush            kernel/bpf/bpf_lru_list.c:298
       ...
      read to 0xffff88801521bc22 of 1 bytes by task 10043 on cpu 0:
       bpf_common_lru_push_free      kernel/bpf/bpf_lru_list.c:507
       bpf_lru_push_free             kernel/bpf/bpf_lru_list.c:555
       ...
    
    Fix the data races where node->type is read outside the critical section
    (for double-checked locking) by marking the access with READ_ONCE() as
    well as ensuring the variable is only accessed once.

    soc: aspeed: snoop: Add clock control logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f94cf15583be554df7aaa651b8ff8e1b68fbe51 ]
    
    If LPC SNOOP driver is registered ahead of lpc-ctrl module, LPC
    SNOOP block will be enabled without heart beating of LCLK until
    lpc-ctrl enables the LCLK. This issue causes improper handling on
    host interrupts when the host sends interrupt in that time frame.
    Then kernel eventually forcibly disables the interrupt with
    dumping stack and printing a 'nobody cared this irq' message out.
    
    To prevent this issue, all LPC sub-nodes should enable LCLK
    individually so this patch adds clock control logic into the LPC
    SNOOP driver.

    ARM: s3c: fix fiq for clang IAS
    
    [ Upstream commit 7f9942c61fa60eda7cc8e42f04bd25b7d175876e ]
    
    Building with the clang integrated assembler produces a couple of
    errors for the s3c24xx fiq support:

    There are apparently two problems: one with extraneous or duplicate
    labels, and one with old-style opcode mnemonics. Stefan Agner has
    previously fixed other problems like this, but missed this particular
    file.

    staging: rtl8723bs: wifi_regd.c: Fix incorrect number of regulatory rules
    
    [ Upstream commit 61834c967a929f6b4b7fcb91f43fa225cc29aa19 ]
    
    The custom regulatory ruleset in the rtl8723bs driver lists an incorrect
    number of rules: one too many. This results in an out-of-bounds access,
    as detected by KASAN. This was possible thanks to the newly added support
    for KASAN on ARMv7.
    
    Fix this by filling in the correct number of rules given.

    usb: dwc2: Make "trimming xfer length" a debug message
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a9e38cabd80356ffb98c2c88fec528ea9644fd5 ]
    
    With some USB network adapters, such as DM96xx, the following message
    is seen for each maximum size receive packet.
    
    dwc2 ff540000.usb: dwc2_update_urb_state(): trimming xfer length
    
    This happens because the packet size requested by the driver is 1522
    bytes, wMaxPacketSize is 64, the dwc2 driver configures the chip to
    receive 24*64 = 1536 bytes, and the chip does indeed send more than
    1522 bytes of data. Since the event does not indicate an error condition,
    the message is just noise. Demote it to debug level.

    usb: dwc2: Abort transaction after errors with unknown reason
    
    [ Upstream commit f74b68c61cbc4b2245022fcce038509333d63f6f ]
    
    In some situations, the following error messages are reported.
    
    dwc2 ff540000.usb: dwc2_hc_chhltd_intr_dma: Channel 1 - ChHltd set, but reason is unknown
    dwc2 ff540000.usb: hcint 0x00000002, intsts 0x04000021
    
    This is sometimes followed by:
    
    dwc2 ff540000.usb: dwc2_update_urb_state_abn(): trimming xfer length
    
    and then:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at kernel/v4.19/drivers/usb/dwc2/hcd.c:2913
                            dwc2_assign_and_init_hc+0x98c/0x990
    
    The warning suggests that an odd buffer address is to be used for DMA.
    
    After an error is observed, the receive buffer may be full
    (urb->actual_length >= urb->length). However, the urb is still left in
    the queue unless three errors were observed in a row. When it is queued
    again, the dwc2 hcd code translates this into a 1-block transfer.
    If urb->actual_length (ie the total expected receive length) is not
    DMA-aligned, the buffer pointer programmed into the chip will be
    unaligned. This results in the observed warning.
    
    To solve the problem, abort input transactions after an error with
    unknown cause if the entire packet was already received. This may be
    a bit drastic, but we don't really know why the transfer was aborted
    even though the entire packet was received. Aborting the transfer in
    this situation is less risky than accepting a potentially corrupted
    packet.
    
    With this patch in place, the 'ChHltd set' and 'trimming xfer length'
    messages are still observed, but there are no more transfer attempts
    with odd buffer addresses.

    usb: dwc2: Do not update data length if it is 0 on inbound transfers
    
    [ Upstream commit 415fa1c7305dedbb345e2cc8ac91769bc1c83f1a ]
    
    The DWC2 documentation states that transfers with zero data length should
    set the number of packets to 1 and the transfer length to 0. This is not
    currently the case for inbound transfers: the transfer length is set to
    the maximum packet length. This can have adverse effects if the chip
    actually does transfer data as it is programmed to do. Follow chip
    documentation and keep the transfer length set to 0 in that situation.

    [ Upstream commit 44f416879a442600b006ef7dec3a6dc98bcf59c6 ]
    
    We have gpio_86 wired internally to the bandgap thermal shutdown
    interrupt on 4430 like we have it on 4460 according to the TRM.
    This can be found easily by searching for TSHUT.
    
    For some reason the thermal shutdown interrupt was never added
    for 4430, let's add it. I believe this is needed for the thermal
    shutdown interrupt handler ti_bandgap_tshut_irq_handler() to call
    orderly_poweroff().

    usb: gadget: u_audio: Free requests only after callback
    
    [ Upstream commit 7de8681be2cde9f6953d3be1fa6ce05f9fe6e637 ]
    
    As per the kernel doc for usb_ep_dequeue(), it states that "this
    routine is asynchronous, that is, it may return before the completion
    routine runs". And indeed since v5.0 the dwc3 gadget driver updated
    its behavior to place dequeued requests on to a cancelled list to be
    given back later after the endpoint is stopped.
    
    The free_ep() was incorrectly assuming that a request was ready to
    be freed after calling dequeue which results in a use-after-free
    in dwc3 when it traverses its cancelled list. Fix this by moving
    the usb_ep_free_request() call to the callback itself in case the
    ep is disabled.

    ACPICA commit 1a3a549286ea9db07d7ec700e7a70dd8bcc4354e
    
    The macros to classify different AML exception codes are broken. For
    instance,
    
      ACPI_ENV_EXCEPTION(Status)
    
    will always evaluate to zero due to
    
      #define AE_CODE_ENVIRONMENTAL      0x0000
      #define ACPI_ENV_EXCEPTION(Status) (Status & AE_CODE_ENVIRONMENTAL)
    
    Similarly, ACPI_AML_EXCEPTION(Status) will evaluate to a non-zero
    value for error codes of type AE_CODE_PROGRAMMER, AE_CODE_ACPI_TABLES,
    as well as AE_CODE_AML, and not just AE_CODE_AML as the name suggests.
    
    This commit fixes those checks.

    In contrast to the H6 (and later) manuals, the A64 datasheet does not
    specify any limitations in the maximum possible frequency for eMMC
    controllers.
    However experimentation has found that a 150 MHz limit similar to other
    SoCs and also the MMC0 and MMC1 controllers on the A64 seems to exist
    for the MMC2 controller.
    
    Limit the frequency for the MMC2 controller to 150 MHz in the SoC .dtsi.
    The Pinebook seems to be the an odd exception, since it apparently seems
    to work with 200 MHz as well, so overwrite this in its board .dts file.
    
    Tested on a Pine64-LTS: 200 MHz HS-200 fails, 150 MHz HS-200 works.

    [ Upstream commit 941432d007689f3774646e41a1439228b6c6ee0e ]
    
    The SD card on the SoPine SoM module is somewhat concealed, so was
    originally defined as "non-removable".
    However there is a working card-detect pin (tested on two different
    SoM versions), and in certain SoM base boards it might be actually
    accessible at runtime.
    Also the Pine64-LTS shares the SoPine base .dtsi, so inherited the
    non-removable flag, even though the SD card slot is perfectly accessible
    and usable there. (It turns out that just *my* board has a broken card
    detect switch, so I originally thought CD wouldn't work on the LTS.)
    
    Drop the "non-removable" flag to describe the SD card slot properly.

    [ Upstream commit cc72570747e43335f4933a24dd74d5653639176a ]
    
    In recent Allwinner SoCs the first USB host controller (HCI0) shares
    the first PHY with the MUSB controller. Probably to make this sharing
    work, we were avoiding to declare this in the DT. This has two
    shortcomings:
    - U-Boot (which uses the same .dts) cannot use this port in host mode
      without a PHY linked, so we were loosing one USB port there.
    - It requires the MUSB driver to be enabled and loaded, although we
      don't actually use it.
    
    To avoid those issues, let's add this PHY link to the A64 .dtsi file.
    After all PHY port 0 *is* connected to HCI0, so we should describe
    it as this. Remove the part from the Pinebook DTS which already had
    this property.
    
    This makes it work in U-Boot, also improves compatiblity when no MUSB
    driver is loaded (for instance in distribution installers).

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix PCM buffer allocation in non-vmalloc mode
    
    commit fb3c293b82c31a9a68fbcf4e7a45fadd8a47ea2b upstream.
    
    The commit f274baa49be6 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Allow non-vmalloc buffer
    for PCM buffers") introduced the mode to allocate coherent pages for
    PCM buffers, and it used bus->controller device as its DMA device.
    It turned out, however, that bus->sysdev is a more appropriate device
    to be used for DMA mapping in HCD code.
    
    This patch corrects the device reference accordingly.
    
    Note that, on most platforms, both point to the very same device,
    hence this patch doesn't change anything practically.  But on
    platforms like xhcd-plat hcd, the change becomes effective.

    bfq: Avoid false bfq queue merging
    
    commit 41e76c85660c022c6bf5713bfb6c21e64a487cec upstream.
    
    bfq_setup_cooperator() uses bfqd->in_serv_last_pos so detect whether it
    makes sense to merge current bfq queue with the in-service queue.
    However if the in-service queue is freshly scheduled and didn't dispatch
    any requests yet, bfqd->in_serv_last_pos is stale and contains value
    from the previously scheduled bfq queue which can thus result in a bogus
    decision that the two queues should be merged. This bug can be observed
    for example with the following fio jobfile:
    
    [global]
    direct=0
    ioengine=sync
    invalidate=1
    size=1g
    rw=read
    
    [reader]
    numjobs=4
    directory=/mnt
    
    where the 4 processes will end up in the one shared bfq queue although
    they do IO to physically very distant files (for some reason I was able to
    observe this only with slice_idle=1ms setting).
    
    Fix the problem by invalidating bfqd->in_serv_last_pos when switching
    in-service queue.

    kdb: Make memory allocations more robust
    
    commit 93f7a6d818deef69d0ba652d46bae6fbabbf365c upstream.
    
    Currently kdb uses in_interrupt() to determine whether its library
    code has been called from the kgdb trap handler or from a saner calling
    context such as driver init. This approach is broken because
    in_interrupt() alone isn't able to determine kgdb trap handler entry from
    normal task context. This can happen during normal use of basic features
    such as breakpoints and can also be trivially reproduced using:
    echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger
    
    We can improve this by adding check for in_dbg_master() instead which
    explicitly determines if we are running in debugger context.

    vmlinux.lds.h: add DWARF v5 sections
    
    commit 3c4fa46b30c551b1df2fb1574a684f68bc22067c upstream.
    
    We expect toolchains to produce these new debug info sections as part of
    DWARF v5. Add explicit placements to prevent the linker warnings from
    --orphan-section=warn.
    
    Compilers may produce such sections with explicit -gdwarf-5, or based on
    the implicit default version of DWARF when -g is used via DEBUG_INFO.
    This implicit default changes over time, and has changed to DWARF v5
    with GCC 11.
    
    .debug_sup was mentioned in review, but without compilers producing it
    today, let's wait to add it until it becomes necessary.

    locking/static_key: Fix false positive warnings on concurrent dec/inc
    
    commit a1247d06d01045d7ab2882a9c074fbf21137c690 upstream.
    
    Even though the atomic_dec_and_mutex_lock() in
    __static_key_slow_dec_cpuslocked() can never see a negative value in
    key->enabled the subsequent sanity check is re-reading key->enabled, which may
    have been set to -1 in the meantime by static_key_slow_inc_cpuslocked().
    
                    CPU  A                               CPU B
    
     __static_key_slow_dec_cpuslocked():          static_key_slow_inc_cpuslocked():
                                   # enabled = 1
       atomic_dec_and_mutex_lock()
                                   # enabled = 0
                                                  atomic_read() == 0
                                                  atomic_set(-1)
                                   # enabled = -1
       val = atomic_read()
       # Oops - val == -1!
    
    The test case is TCP's clean_acked_data_enable() / clean_acked_data_disable()
    as tickled by KTLS (net/ktls).

    scripts/recordmcount.pl: support big endian for ARCH sh
    
    [ Upstream commit 93ca696376dd3d44b9e5eae835ffbc84772023ec ]
    
    The kernel test robot reported the following issue:
    
        CC [M]  drivers/soc/litex/litex_soc_ctrl.o
      sh4-linux-objcopy: Unable to change endianness of input file(s)

      sh4-linux-objcopy: 'drivers/soc/litex/.tmp_mx_litex_soc_ctrl.o': No such file
    
    The problem is that the format of input file is elf32-shbig-linux, but
    sh4-linux-objcopy wants to output a file which format is elf32-sh-linux:
    
      $ sh4-linux-objdump -d drivers/soc/litex/litex_soc_ctrl.o | grep format
      drivers/soc/litex/litex_soc_ctrl.o:     file format elf32-shbig-linux

    cifs: Set CIFS_MOUNT_USE_PREFIX_PATH flag on setting cifs_sb->prepath.
    
    [ Upstream commit a738c93fb1c17e386a09304b517b1c6b2a6a5a8b ]
    
    While debugging another issue today, Steve and I noticed that if a
    subdir for a file share is already mounted on the client, any new
    mount of any other subdir (or the file share root) of the same share
    results in sharing the cifs superblock, which e.g. can result in
    incorrect device name.
    
    While setting prefix path for the root of a cifs_sb,
    CIFS_MOUNT_USE_PREFIX_PATH flag should also be set.
    Without it, prepath is not even considered in some places,
    and output of "mount" and various /proc/<>/*mount* related
    options can be missing part of the device name.

    block: don't release queue's sysfs lock during switching elevator
    
    commit b89f625e28d44552083f43752f62d8621ded0a04 upstream.
    
    cecf5d87ff20 ("block: split .sysfs_lock into two locks") starts to
    release & acquire sysfs_lock before registering/un-registering elevator
    queue during switching elevator for avoiding potential deadlock from
    showing & storing 'queue/iosched' attributes and removing elevator's
    kobject.
    
    Turns out there isn't such deadlock because 'q->sysfs_lock' isn't
    required in .show & .store of queue/iosched's attributes, and just
    elevator's sysfs lock is acquired in elv_iosched_store() and
    elv_iosched_show(). So it is safe to hold queue's sysfs lock when
    registering/un-registering elevator queue.
    
    The biggest issue is that commit cecf5d87ff20 assumes that concurrent
    write on 'queue/scheduler' can't happen. However, this assumption isn't
    true, because kernfs_fop_write() only guarantees that concurrent write
    aren't called on the same open file, but the write could be from
    different open on the file. So we can't release & re-acquire queue's
    sysfs lock during switching elevator, otherwise use-after-free on
    elevator could be triggered.
    
    Fixes the issue by not releasing queue's sysfs lock during switching
    elevator.

    block: fix race between switching elevator and removing queues
    
    commit 0a67b5a926e63ff5492c3c675eab5900580d056d upstream.
    
    cecf5d87ff20 ("block: split .sysfs_lock into two locks") starts to
    release & actuire sysfs_lock again during switching elevator. So it
    isn't enough to prevent switching elevator from happening by simply
    clearing QUEUE_FLAG_REGISTERED with holding sysfs_lock, because
    in-progress switch still can move on after re-acquiring the lock,
    meantime the flag of QUEUE_FLAG_REGISTERED won't get checked.
    
    Fixes this issue by checking 'q->elevator' directly & locklessly after
    q->kobj is removed in blk_unregister_queue(), this way is safe because
    q->elevator can't be changed at that time.

    block: split .sysfs_lock into two locks
    
    commit cecf5d87ff2035127bb5a9ee054d0023a4a7cad3 upstream.
    
    The kernfs built-in lock of 'kn->count' is held in sysfs .show/.store
    path. Meantime, inside block's .show/.store callback, q->sysfs_lock is
    required.
    
    However, when mq & iosched kobjects are removed via
    blk_mq_unregister_dev() & elv_unregister_queue(), q->sysfs_lock is held
    too. This way causes AB-BA lock because the kernfs built-in lock of
    'kn-count' is required inside kobject_del() too, see the lockdep warning[1].
    
    On the other hand, it isn't necessary to acquire q->sysfs_lock for
    both blk_mq_unregister_dev() & elv_unregister_queue() because
    clearing REGISTERED flag prevents storing to 'queue/scheduler'
    from being happened. Also sysfs write(store) is exclusive, so no
    necessary to hold the lock for elv_unregister_queue() when it is
    called in switching elevator path.
    
    So split .sysfs_lock into two: one is still named as .sysfs_lock for
    covering sync .store, the other one is named as .sysfs_dir_lock
    for covering kobjects and related status change.
    
    sysfs itself can handle the race between add/remove kobjects and
    showing/storing attributes under kobjects. For switching scheduler
    via storing to 'queue/scheduler', we use the queue flag of
    QUEUE_FLAG_REGISTERED with .sysfs_lock for avoiding the race, then
    we can avoid to hold .sysfs_lock during removing/adding kobjects.

    arm64: tegra: Add power-domain for Tegra210 HDA
    
    commit 1e0ca5467445bc1f41a9e403d6161a22f313dae7 upstream.
    
    HDA initialization is failing occasionally on Tegra210 and following
    print is observed in the boot log. Because of this probe() fails and
    no sound card is registered.
    
      [16.800802] tegra-hda 70030000.hda: no codecs found!
    
    Codecs request a state change and enumeration by the controller. In
    failure cases this does not seem to happen as STATETS register reads 0.
    
    The problem seems to be related to the HDA codec dependency on SOR
    power domain. If it is gated during HDA probe then the failure is
    observed. Building Tegra HDA driver into kernel image avoids this
    failure but does not completely address the dependency part. Fix this
    problem by adding 'power-domains' DT property for Tegra210 HDA. Note
    that Tegra186 and Tegra194 HDA do this already.

    HID: make arrays usage and value to be the same
    
    commit ed9be64eefe26d7d8b0b5b9fa3ffdf425d87a01f upstream.
    
    The HID subsystem allows an "HID report field" to have a different
    number of "values" and "usages" when it is allocated. When a field
    struct is created, the size of the usage array is guaranteed to be at
    least as large as the values array, but it may be larger. This leads to
    a potential out-of-bounds write in
    __hidinput_change_resolution_multipliers() and an out-of-bounds read in
    hidinput_count_leds().
    
    To fix this, let's make sure that both the usage and value arrays are
    the same size.
