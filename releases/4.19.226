    fuse: fix live lock in fuse_iget()
    
    commit 775c5033a0d164622d9d10dd0f0a5531639ed3ed upstream.
    
    Commit 5d069dbe8aaf ("fuse: fix bad inode") replaced make_bad_inode()
    in fuse_iget() with a private implementation fuse_make_bad().
    
    The private implementation fails to remove the bad inode from inode
    cache, so the retry loop with iget5_locked() finds the same bad inode
    and marks it bad forever.

    fuse: fix bad inode
    
    commit 5d069dbe8aaf2a197142558b6fb2978189ba3454 upstream.
    
    Jan Kara's analysis of the syzbot report (edited):
    
      The reproducer opens a directory on FUSE filesystem, it then attaches
      dnotify mark to the open directory.  After that a fuse_do_getattr() call
      finds that attributes returned by the server are inconsistent, and calls
      make_bad_inode() which, among other things does:
    
              inode->i_mode = S_IFREG;
    
      This then confuses dnotify which doesn't tear down its structures
      properly and eventually crashes.
    
    Avoid calling make_bad_inode() on a live inode: switch to a private flag on
    the fuse inode.  Also add the test to ops which the bad_inode_ops would
    have caught.
    
    This bug goes back to the initial merge of fuse in 2.6.14...

    net_sched: restore "mpu xxx" handling
    
    commit fb80445c438c78b40b547d12b8d56596ce4ccfeb upstream.
    
    commit 56b765b79e9a ("htb: improved accuracy at high rates") broke
    "overhead X", "linklayer atm" and "mpu X" attributes.
    
    "overhead X" and "linklayer atm" have already been fixed. This restores
    the "mpu X" handling, as might be used by DOCSIS or Ethernet shaping:
    
        tc class add ... htb rate X overhead 4 mpu 64
    
    The code being fixed is used by htb, tbf and act_police. Cake has its
    own mpu handling. qdisc_calculate_pkt_len still uses the size table
    containing values adjusted for mpu by user space.
    
    iproute2 tc has always passed mpu into the kernel via a tc_ratespec
    structure, but the kernel never directly acted on it, merely stored it
    so that it could be read back by `tc class show`.
    
    Rather, tc would generate length-to-time tables that included the mpu
    (and linklayer) in their construction, and the kernel used those tables.
    
    Since v3.7, the tables were no longer used. Along with "mpu", this also
    broke "overhead" and "linklayer" which were fixed in 01cb71d2d47b
    ("net_sched: restore "overhead xxx" handling", v3.10) and 8a8e3d84b171
    ("net_sched: restore "linklayer atm" handling", v3.11).
    
    "overhead" was fixed by simply restoring use of tc_ratespec::overhead -
    this had originally been used by the kernel but was initially omitted
    from the new non-table-based calculations.
    
    "linklayer" had been handled in the table like "mpu", but the mode was
    not originally passed in tc_ratespec. The new implementation was made to
    handle it by getting new versions of tc to pass the mode in an extended
    tc_ratespec, and for older versions of tc the table contents were analysed
    at load time to deduce linklayer.
    
    As "mpu" has always been given to the kernel in tc_ratespec,
    accompanying the mpu-based table, we can restore system functionality
    with no userspace change by making the kernel act on the tc_ratespec
    value.

    dmaengine: at_xdmac: Don't start transactions at tx_submit level
    
    commit bccfb96b59179d4f96cbbd1ddff8fac6d335eae4 upstream.
    
    tx_submit is supposed to push the current transaction descriptor to a
    pending queue, waiting for issue_pending() to be called. issue_pending()
    must start the transfer, not tx_submit(), thus remove
    at_xdmac_start_xfer() from at_xdmac_tx_submit(). Clients of at_xdmac that
    assume that tx_submit() starts the transfer must be updated and call
    dma_async_issue_pending() if they miss to call it (one example is
    atmel_serial).
    
    As the at_xdmac_start_xfer() is now called only from
    at_xdmac_advance_work() when !at_xdmac_chan_is_enabled(), the
    at_xdmac_chan_is_enabled() check is no longer needed in
    at_xdmac_start_xfer(), thus remove it.

    netns: add schedule point in ops_exit_list()
    
    commit 2836615aa22de55b8fca5e32fe1b27a67cda625e upstream.
    
    When under stress, cleanup_net() can have to dismantle
    netns in big numbers. ops_exit_list() currently calls
    many helpers [1] that have no schedule point, and we can
    end up with soft lockups, particularly on hosts
    with many cpus.
    
    Even for moderate amount of netns processed by cleanup_net()
    this patch avoids latency spikes.
    
    [1] Some of these helpers like fib_sync_up() and fib_sync_down_dev()
    are very slow because net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c uses host-wide hash tables,
    and ifindex is used as the only input of two hash functions.
        ifindexes tend to be the same for all netns (lo.ifindex==1 per instance)
        This will be fixed in a separate patch.

    rtc: pxa: fix null pointer dereference
    
    commit 34127b3632b21e5c391756e724b1198eb9917981 upstream.
    
    With the latest stable kernel versions the rtc on the PXA based
    Zaurus does not work, when booting I see the following kernel messages:
    
    pxa-rtc pxa-rtc: failed to find rtc clock source
    pxa-rtc pxa-rtc: Unable to init SA1100 RTC sub-device
    pxa-rtc: probe of pxa-rtc failed with error -2
    hctosys: unable to open rtc device (rtc0)
    
    I think this is because commit f2997775b111 ("rtc: sa1100: fix possible
    race condition") moved the allocation of the rtc_device struct out of
    sa1100_rtc_init and into sa1100_rtc_probe. This means that pxa_rtc_probe
    also needs to do allocation for the rtc_device struct, otherwise
    sa1100_rtc_init will try to dereference a null pointer. This patch adds
    that allocation by copying how sa1100_rtc_probe in
    drivers/rtc/rtc-sa1100.c does it; after the IRQs are set up a managed
    rtc_device is allocated.
    
    I've tested this patch with `qemu-system-arm -machine akita` and with a
    real Zaurus SL-C1000 applied to 4.19, 5.4, and 5.10.

    net: axienet: fix number of TX ring slots for available check
    
    commit aba57a823d2985a2cc8c74a2535f3a88e68d9424 upstream.
    
    The check for the number of available TX ring slots was off by 1 since a
    slot is required for the skb header as well as each fragment. This could
    result in overwriting a TX ring slot that was still in use.

    net: axienet: Wait for PhyRstCmplt after core reset
    
    commit b400c2f4f4c53c86594dd57098970d97d488bfde upstream.
    
    When resetting the device, wait for the PhyRstCmplt bit to be set
    in the interrupt status register before continuing initialization, to
    ensure that the core is actually ready. When using an external PHY, this
    also ensures we do not start trying to access the PHY while it is still
    in reset. The PHY reset is initiated by the core reset which is
    triggered just above, but remains asserted for 5ms after the core is
    reset according to the documentation.
    
    The MgtRdy bit could also be waited for, but unfortunately when using
    7-series devices, the bit does not appear to work as documented (it
    seems to behave as some sort of link state indication and not just an
    indication the transceiver is ready) so it can't really be relied on for
    this purpose.

    Clang is more pedantic than GCC, which does not warn when failing
    through to a case that is just break or return. Clang's version is more
    in line with the kernel's own stance in deprecated.rst. Add athe missing

    point out the config SLAB_FREELIST_RANDOM as further randomization within

    ARM: dts: Fix vcsi regulator to be always-on for droid4 to prevent hangs
    
    commit ddb52945999dcf35787bf221b62108806182578d upstream.
    
    In addition to using vcsi regulator for the display, looks like droid4 is
    using vcsi regulator to trigger off mode internally with the PMIC firmware
    when the SoC enters deeper idle states. This is configured in the Motorola
    Mapphone Linux kernel sources as "zerov_regulator".
    
    As we currently don't support off mode during idle for omap4, we must
    prevent vcsi from being disabled when the display is blanked to prevent
    the PMIC change to off mode. Otherwise the device will hang on entering
    idle when the display is blanked.
    
    Before commit 089b3f61ecfc ("regulator: core: Let boot-on regulators be
    powered off"), the boot-on regulators never got disabled like they should
    and vcsi did not get turned off on idle.
    
    Let's fix the issue by setting vcsi to always-on for now. Later on we may
    want to claim the vcsi regulator also in the PM code if needed.

    ASoC: dpcm: prevent snd_soc_dpcm use after free
    
    commit a9764869779081e8bf24da07ac040e8f3efcf13a upstream.
    
    The dpcm get from fe_clients/be_clients
    may be free before use
    
    Add a spin lock at snd_soc_card level,
    to protect the dpcm instance.
    The lock may be used in atomic context, so use spin lock.
    
    Use irq spin lock version,
    since the lock may be used in interrupts.
    
    possible race condition between
    void dpcm_be_disconnect(
            ...
            list_del(&dpcm->list_be);
            list_del(&dpcm->list_fe);
            kfree(dpcm);
            ...
    
    and
            for_each_dpcm_fe()
            for_each_dpcm_be*()
    
    race condition example
    Thread 1:
        snd_soc_dapm_mixer_update_power()

    crypto: stm32/crc32 - Fix kernel BUG triggered in probe()
    
    commit 29009604ad4e3ef784fd9b9fef6f23610ddf633d upstream.
    
    The include/linux/crypto.h struct crypto_alg field cra_driver_name description
    states "Unique name of the transformation provider. " ... " this contains the
    name of the chip or provider and the name of the transformation algorithm."
    
    In case of the stm32-crc driver, field cra_driver_name is identical for all
    registered transformation providers and set to the name of the driver itself,
    which is incorrect. This patch fixes it by assigning a unique cra_driver_name
    to each registered transformation provider.
    
    The kernel crash is triggered when the driver calls crypto_register_shashes()
    which calls crypto_register_shash(), which calls crypto_register_alg(), which
    calls __crypto_register_alg(), which returns -EEXIST, which is propagated
    back through this call chain. Upon -EEXIST from crypto_register_shash(), the
    crypto_register_shashes() starts unregistering the providers back, and calls
    crypto_unregister_shash(), which calls crypto_unregister_alg(), and this is
    where the BUG() triggers due to incorrect cra_refcnt.

    ext4: don't use the orphan list when migrating an inode
    
    commit 6eeaf88fd586f05aaf1d48cb3a139d2a5c6eb055 upstream.
    
    We probably want to remove the indirect block to extents migration
    feature after a deprecation window, but until then, let's fix a
    potential data loss problem caused by the fact that we put the
    tmp_inode on the orphan list.  In the unlikely case where we crash and
    do a journal recovery, the data blocks belonging to the inode being
    migrated are also represented in the tmp_inode on the orphan list ---
    and so its data blocks will get marked unallocated, and available for
    reuse.
    
    Instead, stop putting the tmp_inode on the oprhan list.  So in the
    case where we crash while migrating the inode, we'll leak an inode,
    which is not a disaster.  It will be easily fixed the next time we run
    fsck, and it's better than potentially having blocks getting claimed
    by two different files, and losing data as a result.

    In order to reproduce this problem, the following conditions need to be met:
    1. Ext4 filesystem with no journal;
    2. Filesystem image with incorrect quota data;
    3. Abort filesystem forced by user;
    4. umount filesystem;
    
    As in ext4_quota_write:
    ...
             if (EXT4_SB(sb)->s_journal && !handle) {
                     ext4_msg(sb, KERN_WARNING, "Quota write (off=%llu, len=%llu)"
                             " cancelled because transaction is not started",
                             (unsigned long long)off, (unsigned long long)len);
                     return -EIO;
             }
    ...
    We only check handle if NULL when filesystem has journal. There is need
    check handle if NULL even when filesystem has no journal.

    ext4: set csum seed in tmp inode while migrating to extents
    
    commit e81c9302a6c3c008f5c30beb73b38adb0170ff2d upstream.
    
    When migrating to extents, the temporary inode will have it's own checksum
    seed.  This means that, when swapping the inodes data, the inode checksums
    will be incorrect.
    
    This can be fixed by recalculating the extents checksums again.  Or simply
    by copying the seed into the temporary inode.

    ext4: make sure quota gets properly shutdown on error
    
    commit 15fc69bbbbbc8c72e5f6cc4e1be0f51283c5448e upstream.
    
    When we hit an error when enabling quotas and setting inode flags, we do
    not properly shutdown quota subsystem despite returning error from
    Q_QUOTAON quotactl. This can lead to some odd situations like kernel
    using quota file while it is still writeable for userspace. Make sure we
    properly cleanup the quota subsystem in case of error.

    ext4: make sure to reset inode lockdep class when quota enabling fails
    
    commit 4013d47a5307fdb5c13370b5392498b00fedd274 upstream.
    
    When we succeed in enabling some quota type but fail to enable another
    one with quota feature, we correctly disable all enabled quota types.
    However we forget to reset i_data_sem lockdep class. When the inode gets
    freed and reused, it will inherit this lockdep class (i_data_sem is
    initialized only when a slab is created) and thus eventually lockdep
    barfs about possible deadlocks.

    drm/etnaviv: limit submit sizes
    
    commit 6dfa2fab8ddd46faa771a102672176bee7a065de upstream.
    
    Currently we allow rediculous amounts of kernel memory being allocated
    via the etnaviv GEM_SUBMIT ioctl, which is a pretty easy DoS vector. Put
    some reasonable limits in to fix this.
    
    The commandstream size is limited to 64KB, which was already a soft limit
    on older kernels after which the kernel only took submits on a best effort
    base, so there is no userspace that tries to submit commandstreams larger
    than this. Even if the whole commandstream is a single incrementing address
    load, the size limit also limits the number of potential relocs and
    referenced buffers to slightly under 64K, so use the same limit for those
    arguments. The performance monitoring infrastructure currently supports
    less than 50 performance counter signals, so limiting them to 128 on a
    single submit seems like a reasonably future-proof number for now. This
    number can be bumped if needed without breaking the interface.

    s390/mm: fix 2KB pgtable release race
    
    commit c2c224932fd0ee6854d6ebfc8d059c2bcad86606 upstream.
    
    There is a race on concurrent 2KB-pgtables release paths when
    both upper and lower halves of the containing parent page are
    freed, one via page_table_free_rcu() + __tlb_remove_table(),
    and the other via page_table_free(). The race might lead to a
    corruption as result of remove of list item in page_table_free()
    concurrently with __free_page() in __tlb_remove_table().
    
    Let's assume first the lower and next the upper 2KB-pgtables are
    freed from a page. Since both halves of the page are allocated
    the tracking byte (bits 24-31 of the page _refcount) has value
    of 0x03 initially:
    
    CPU0                            CPU1
    ----                            ----
    
    page_table_free_rcu() // lower half
    {
            // _refcount[31..24] == 0x03
            ...
            atomic_xor_bits(&page->_refcount,
                            0x11U << (0 + 24));
            // _refcount[31..24] <= 0x12
            ...
            table = table | (1U << 0);
            tlb_remove_table(tlb, table);
    }
    ...
    __tlb_remove_table()
    {
            // _refcount[31..24] == 0x12
            mask = _table & 3;
            // mask <= 0x01
            ...
    
                                    page_table_free() // upper half
                                    {
                                            // _refcount[31..24] == 0x12
                                            ...
                                            atomic_xor_bits(
                                                    &page->_refcount,
                                                    1U << (1 + 24));
                                            // _refcount[31..24] <= 0x10
                                            // mask <= 0x10
                                            ...
            atomic_xor_bits(&page->_refcount,
                            mask << (4 + 24));
            // _refcount[31..24] <= 0x00
            // mask <= 0x00
            ...
            if (mask != 0) // == false
                    break;
            fallthrough;
            ...
                                            if (mask & 3) // == false
                                                    ...
                                            else
            __free_page(page);                      list_del(&page->lru);
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      RACE!           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    }                                       ...
                                    }
    
    The problem is page_table_free() releases the page as result of
    lower nibble unset and __tlb_remove_table() observing zero too
    early. With this update page_table_free() will use the similar
    logic as page_table_free_rcu() + __tlb_remove_table(), and mark
    the fragment as pending for removal in the upper nibble until
    after the list_del().
    
    In other words, the parent page is considered as unreferenced and
    safe to release only when the lower nibble is cleared already and
    unsetting a bit in upper nibble results in that nibble turned zero.

    iwlwifi: mvm: Increase the scan timeout guard to 30 seconds
    
    commit ced50f1133af12f7521bb777fcf4046ca908fb77 upstream.
    
    With the introduction of 6GHz channels the scan guard timeout should
    be adjusted to account for the following extreme case:
    
    - All 6GHz channels are scanned passively: 58 channels.
    - The scan is fragmented with the following parameters: 3 fragments,
      95 TUs suspend time, 44 TUs maximal out of channel time.
    
    The above would result with scan time of more than 24 seconds. Thus,
    set the timeout to 30 seconds.

    cputime, cpuacct: Include guest time in user time in cpuacct.stat
    
    commit 9731698ecb9c851f353ce2496292ff9fcea39dff upstream.
    
    cpuacct.stat in no-root cgroups shows user time without guest time
    included int it. This doesn't match with user time shown in root
    cpuacct.stat and /proc/<pid>/stat. This also affects cgroup2's cpu.stat
    in the same way.
    
    Make account_guest_time() to add user time to cgroup's cpustat to
    fix this.

    serial: Fix incorrect rs485 polarity on uart open
    
    commit d3b3404df318504ec084213ab1065b73f49b0f1d upstream.
    
    Commit a6845e1e1b78 ("serial: core: Consider rs485 settings to drive
    RTS") sought to deassert RTS when opening an rs485-enabled uart port.
    That way, the transceiver does not occupy the bus until it transmits
    data.
    
    Unfortunately, the commit mixed up the logic and *asserted* RTS instead
    of *deasserting* it:
    
    The commit amended uart_port_dtr_rts(), which raises DTR and RTS when
    opening an rs232 port.  "Raising" actually means lowering the signal
    that's coming out of the uart, because an rs232 transceiver not only
    changes a signal's voltage level, it also *inverts* the signal.  See
    the simplified schematic in the MAX232 datasheet for an example:
    https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/max232.pdf
    
    So, to raise RTS on an rs232 port, TIOCM_RTS is *set* in port->mctrl
    and that results in the signal being driven low.
    
    In contrast to rs232, the signal level for rs485 Transmit Enable is the
    identity, not the inversion:  If the transceiver expects a "high" RTS
    signal for Transmit Enable, the signal coming out of the uart must also
    be high, so TIOCM_RTS must be *cleared* in port->mctrl.
    
    The commit did the exact opposite, but it's easy to see why given the
    confusing semantics of rs232 and rs485.  Fix it.

    To reproduce the problem:
    
    1. Filesystem initially mounted read-only, free space fixup flag set.
    
    2. mount -o remount,rw <mountpoint>
    
    3. it takes some time (free space fixup running)
        ... try to terminate running mount by CTRL-C
        ... does not respond, only after free space fixup is complete
        ... then "ubifs_remount_fs: cannot spawn "ubifs_bgt0_0", error -4"
    
    4. mount -o remount,rw <mountpoint>
        ... now finished instantly (fixup already done).
    
    5. Create file or just unmount the filesystem and we get the oops.

    powerpc: handle kdump appropriately with crash_kexec_post_notifiers option
    
    [ Upstream commit 219572d2fc4135b5ce65c735d881787d48b10e71 ]
    
    Kdump can be triggered after panic_notifers since commit f06e5153f4ae2
    ("kernel/panic.c: add "crash_kexec_post_notifiers" option for kdump
    after panic_notifers") introduced crash_kexec_post_notifiers option.
    But using this option would mean smp_send_stop(), that marks all other
    CPUs as offline, gets called before kdump is triggered. As a result,
    kdump routines fail to save other CPUs' registers. To fix this, kdump
    friendly crash_smp_send_stop() function was introduced with kernel
    commit 0ee59413c967 ("x86/panic: replace smp_send_stop() with kdump
    friendly version in panic path"). Override this kdump friendly weak
    function to handle crash_kexec_post_notifiers option appropriately
    on powerpc.

    ALSA: seq: Set upper limit of processed events
    
    [ Upstream commit 6fadb494a638d8b8a55864ecc6ac58194f03f327 ]
    
    Currently ALSA sequencer core tries to process the queued events as
    much as possible when they become dispatchable.  If applications try
    to queue too massive events to be processed at the very same timing,
    the sequencer core would still try to process such all events, either
    in the interrupt context or via some notifier; in either away, it
    might be a cause of RCU stall or such problems.
    
    As a potential workaround for those problems, this patch adds the
    upper limit of the amount of events to be processed.  The remaining
    events are processed in the next batch, so they won't be lost.
    
    For the time being, it's limited up to 1000 events per queue, which
    should be high enough for any normal usages.

    Current I2C reset procedure is broken in two ways:
    1) It only generate 1 START instead of 9 STARTs and STOP.
    2) It leaves the bus Busy so every I2C xfer after the first
       fixup calls the reset routine again, for every xfer there after.
    
    This fixes both errors.

    i2c: i801: Don't silently correct invalid transfer size
    
    [ Upstream commit effa453168a7eeb8a562ff4edc1dbf9067360a61 ]
    
    If an invalid block size is provided, reject it instead of silently
    changing it to a supported value. Especially critical I see the case of
    a write transfer with block length 0. In this case we have no guarantee
    that the byte we would write is valid. When silently reducing a read to
    32 bytes then we don't return an error and the caller may falsely
    assume that we returned the full requested data.
    
    If this change should break any (broken) caller, then I think we should
    fix the caller.

    powerpc/watchdog: Fix missed watchdog reset due to memory ordering race
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dad4ba68a2483fc80d70b9dc90bbe16e1f27263 ]
    
    It is possible for all CPUs to miss the pending cpumask becoming clear,
    and then nobody resetting it, which will cause the lockup detector to
    stop working. It will eventually expire, but watchdog_smp_panic will
    avoid doing anything if the pending mask is clear and it will never be
    reset.
    
    Order the cpumask clear vs the subsequent test to close this race.
    
    Add an extra check for an empty pending mask when the watchdog fires and
    finds its bit still clear, to try to catch any other possible races or
    bugs here and keep the watchdog working. The extra test in
    arch_touch_nmi_watchdog is required to prevent the new warning from
    firing off.

    In handle_interruption(), we call faulthandler_disabled() to check whether the
    fault handler is not disabled. If the fault handler is disabled, we immediately
    call do_page_fault(). It then calls faulthandler_disabled(). If disabled,
    do_page_fault() attempts to fixup the exception by jumping to no_context:
    
    no_context:
    
            if (!user_mode(regs) && fixup_exception(regs)) {
                    return;
            }
    
            parisc_terminate("Bad Address (null pointer deref?)", regs, code, address);
    
    Apart from the error messages, the two blocks of code perform the same
    function.
    
    We can avoid two calls to faulthandler_disabled() by a simple revision
    to the code in handle_interruption().
    
    Note: I didn't try to fix the formatting of this code block.

    serial: core: Keep mctrl register state and cached copy in sync
    
    [ Upstream commit 93a770b7e16772530196674ffc79bb13fa927dc6 ]
    
    struct uart_port contains a cached copy of the Modem Control signals.
    It is used to skip register writes in uart_update_mctrl() if the new
    signal state equals the old signal state.  It also avoids a register
    read to obtain the current state of output signals.
    
    When a uart_port is registered, uart_configure_port() changes signal
    state but neglects to keep the cached copy in sync.  That may cause
    a subsequent register write to be incorrectly skipped.  Fix it before
    it trips somebody up.
    
    This behavior has been present ever since the serial core was introduced
    in 2002:
    https://git.kernel.org/history/history/c/33c0d1b0c3eb
    
    So far it was never an issue because the cached copy is initialized to 0
    by kzalloc() and when uart_configure_port() is executed, at most DTR has
    been set by uart_set_options() or sunsu_console_setup().  Therefore,
    a stable designation seems unnecessary.

    serial: pl010: Drop CR register reset on set_termios
    
    [ Upstream commit 08a0c6dff91c965e39905cf200d22db989203ccb ]
    
    pl010_set_termios() briefly resets the CR register to zero.
    
    Where does this register write come from?
    
    The PL010 driver's IRQ handler ambauart_int() originally modified the CR
    register without holding the port spinlock.  ambauart_set_termios() also
    modified that register.  To prevent concurrent read-modify-writes by the
    IRQ handler and to prevent transmission while changing baudrate,
    ambauart_set_termios() had to disable interrupts.  That is achieved by
    writing zero to the CR register.
    
    However in 2004 the PL010 driver was amended to acquire the port
    spinlock in the IRQ handler, obviating the need to disable interrupts in
    ->set_termios():
    https://git.kernel.org/history/history/c/157c0342e591
    
    That rendered the CR register write obsolete.  Drop it.

    regulator: qcom_smd: Align probe function with rpmh-regulator
    
    [ Upstream commit 14e2976fbabdacb01335d7f91eeebbc89c67ddb1 ]
    
    The RPMh regulator driver is much newer and gets more attention, which in
    consequence makes it do a few things better. Update qcom_smd-regulator's
    probe function to mimic what rpmh-regulator does to address a couple of
    issues:
    
    - Probe defer now works correctly, before it used to, well,
      kinda just die.. This fixes reliable probing on (at least) PM8994,
      because Linux apparently cannot deal with supply map dependencies yet..
    
    - Regulator data is now matched more sanely: regulator data is matched
      against each individual regulator node name and throwing an -EINVAL if
      data is missing, instead of just assuming everything is fine and
      iterating over all subsequent array members.
    
    - status = "disabled" will now work for disabling individual regulators in
      DT. Previously it didn't seem to do much if anything at all.

    net: gemini: allow any RGMII interface mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e4f325a0a55907b14f579e6b1a38c53755e3de2 ]
    
    The four RGMII interface modes take care of the required RGMII delay
    configuration at the PHY and should not be limited by the network MAC
    driver. Sadly, gemini was only permitting RGMII mode with no delays,
    which would require the required delay to be inserted via PCB tracking
    or by the MAC.
    
    However, there are designs that require the PHY to add the delay, which
    is impossible without Gemini permitting the other three PHY interface
    modes. Fix the driver to allow these.

    net: phy: marvell: configure RGMII delays for 88E1118
    
    [ Upstream commit f22725c95ececb703c3f741e8f946d23705630b7 ]
    
    Corentin Labbe reports that the SSI 1328 does not work when allowing
    the PHY to operate at gigabit speeds, but does work with the generic
    PHY driver.
    
    This appears to be because m88e1118_config_init() writes a fixed value
    to the MSCR register, claiming that this is to enable 1G speeds.
    However, this always sets bits 4 and 5, enabling RGMII transmit and
    receive delays. The suspicion is that the original board this was
    added for required the delays to make 1G speeds work.
    
    Add the necessary configuration for RGMII delays for the 88E1118 to
    bring this into line with the requirements for RGMII support, and thus
    make the SSI 1328 work.
    
    Corentin Labbe has tested this on gemini-ssi1328 and gemini-ns2502.

    ACPICA commit 3dd7e1f3996456ef81bfe14cba29860e8d42949e
    
    According to ACPI 6.4, Section 16.2, the CPU cache flushing is
    required on entering to S1, S2, and S3, but the ACPICA code
    flushes the CPU cache regardless of the sleep state.
    
    Blind cache flush on entering S5 causes problems for TDX.
    
    Flushing happens with WBINVD that is not supported in the TDX
    environment.
    
    TDX only supports S5 and adjusting ACPICA code to conform to the
    spec more strictly fixes the issue.

    ACPICA: Executer: Fix the REFCLASS_REFOF case in acpi_ex_opcode_1A_0T_1R()
    
    [ Upstream commit 24ea5f90ec9548044a6209685c5010edd66ffe8f ]
    
    ACPICA commit d984f12041392fa4156b52e2f7e5c5e7bc38ad9e
    
    If Operand[0] is a reference of the ACPI_REFCLASS_REFOF class,
    acpi_ex_opcode_1A_0T_1R () calls acpi_ns_get_attached_object () to
    obtain return_desc which may require additional resolution with
    the help of acpi_ex_read_data_from_field (). If the latter fails,
    the reference counter of the original return_desc is decremented
    which is incorrect, because acpi_ns_get_attached_object () does not
    increment the reference counter of the object returned by it.
    
    This issue may lead to premature deletion of the attached object
    while it is still attached and a use-after-free and crash in the
    host OS.  For example, this may happen when on evaluation of ref_of()
    a local region field where there is no registered handler for the
    given Operation Region.
    
    Fix it by making acpi_ex_opcode_1A_0T_1R () return Status right away
    after a acpi_ex_read_data_from_field () failure.

    ACPICA commit c11af67d8f7e3d381068ce7771322f2b5324d687
    
    If original_count is 0 in acpi_ut_update_ref_count (),
    acpi_ut_delete_internal_obj () is invoked for the target object, which is

    for a different purpose by the host OS.  Moreover, a confusing debug
    message following the "Reference Count is already zero, cannot
    decrement" warning is printed in that case.

    [ Upstream commit f81bdeaf816142e0729eea0cc84c395ec9673151 ]
    
    ACPICA commit bc02c76d518135531483dfc276ed28b7ee632ce1
    
    The current ACPI_ACCESS_*_WIDTH defines do not provide a way to
    test that size is small enough to not cause an overflow when
    applied to a 32-bit integer.
    
    Rather than adding more magic numbers, add ACPI_ACCESS_*_SHIFT,
    ACPI_ACCESS_*_MAX, and ACPI_ACCESS_*_DEFAULT #defines and
    redefine ACPI_ACCESS_*_WIDTH in terms of the new #defines.
    
    This was inititally reported on Linux where a size of 102 in
    ACPI_ACCESS_BIT_WIDTH caused an overflow error in the SPCR
    initialization code.

    jffs2: GC deadlock reading a page that is used in jffs2_write_begin()
    
    [ Upstream commit aa39cc675799bc92da153af9a13d6f969c348e82 ]
    
    GC task can deadlock in read_cache_page() because it may attempt
    to release a page that is actually allocated by another task in
    jffs2_write_begin().
    The reason is that in jffs2_write_begin() there is a small window
    a cache page is allocated for use but not set Uptodate yet.
    
    This ends up with a deadlock between two tasks:
    1) A task (e.g. file copy)
       - jffs2_write_begin() locks a cache page
       - jffs2_write_end() tries to lock "alloc_sem" from
             jffs2_reserve_space() <-- STUCK
    2) GC task (jffs2_gcd_mtd3)
       - jffs2_garbage_collect_pass() locks "alloc_sem"
       - try to lock the same cache page in read_cache_page() <-- STUCK
    
    So to avoid this deadlock, hold "alloc_sem" in jffs2_write_begin()
    while reading data in a cache page.

    iwlwifi: remove module loading failure message
    
    [ Upstream commit 6518f83ffa51131daaf439b66094f684da3fb0ae ]
    
    When CONFIG_DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE is set, iwlwifi crashes
    when the opmode module cannot be loaded, due to completing
    the completion before using drv->dev, which can then already
    be freed.
    
    Fix this by removing the (fairly useless) message. Moving the
    completion later causes a deadlock instead, so that's not an

    If firmware load fails after having loaded some parts of the

    ath9k: Fix out-of-bound memcpy in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ce708f54cc8d73beca213cec66ede5ce100a781 ]
    
    Large pkt_len can lead to out-out-bound memcpy. Current
    ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream allows combining the content of two urb
    inputs to one pkt. The first input can indicate the size of the
    pkt. Any remaining size is saved in hif_dev->rx_remain_len.
    While processing the next input, memcpy is used with rx_remain_len.
    
    4-byte pkt_len can go up to 0xffff, while a single input is 0x4000
    maximum in size (MAX_RX_BUF_SIZE). Thus, the patch adds a check for
    pkt_len which must not exceed 2 * MAX_RX_BUG_SIZE.

    I found the bug using a custome USBFuzz port. It's a research work
    to fuzz USB stack/drivers. I modified it to fuzz ath9k driver only,
    providing hand-crafted usb descriptors to QEMU.
    
    After fixing the value of pkt_tag to ATH_USB_RX_STREAM_MODE_TAG in QEMU
    emulation, I found the KASAN report. The bug is triggerable whenever
    pkt_len is above two MAX_RX_BUG_SIZE. I used the same input that crashes
    to test the driver works when applying the patch.

    USB 3.2 spec, 9.2.5.4 "Changing Function Suspend State" says that "If
    the link is in a non-U0 state, then the device must transition the link
    to U0 prior to sending the remote wake message", but the hub only
    transits the link to U0 after signaling remote wakeup.
    
    So be more forgiving and use a 20ms delay to let the link transit to U0
    for remote wakeup.

    audit: ensure userspace is penalized the same as the kernel when under pressure
    
    [ Upstream commit 8f110f530635af44fff1f4ee100ecef0bac62510 ]
    
    Due to the audit control mutex necessary for serializing audit
    userspace messages we haven't been able to block/penalize userspace
    processes that attempt to send audit records while the system is
    under audit pressure.  The result is that privileged userspace
    applications have a priority boost with respect to audit as they are
    not bound by the same audit queue throttling as the other tasks on
    the system.
    
    This patch attempts to restore some balance to the system when under
    audit pressure by blocking these privileged userspace tasks after
    they have finished their audit processing, and dropped the audit
    control mutex, but before they return to userspace.

    mmc: core: Fixup storing of OCR for MMC_QUIRK_NONSTD_SDIO
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c3e5b74b9e2146f564905e50ca716591c76d4f1 ]
    
    The mmc core takes a specific path to support initializing of a
    non-standard SDIO card. This is triggered by looking for the card-quirk,
    MMC_QUIRK_NONSTD_SDIO.
    
    In mmc_sdio_init_card() this gets rather messy, as it causes the code to
    bail out earlier, compared to the usual path. This leads to that the OCR
    doesn't get saved properly in card->ocr. Fortunately, only omap_hsmmc has
    been using the MMC_QUIRK_NONSTD_SDIO and is dealing with the issue, by
    assigning a hardcoded value (0x80) to card->ocr from an ->init_card() ops.
    
    To make the behaviour consistent, let's instead rely on the core to save
    the OCR in card->ocr during initialization.

    media: saa7146: hexium_gemini: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in hexium_attach()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3af86b046933ba513d08399dba0d4d8b50d607d0 ]
    
    In hexium_attach(dev, info), saa7146_vv_init() is called to allocate
    a new memory for dev->vv_data. saa7146_vv_release() will be called on
    failure of saa7146_register_device(). There is a dereference of
    dev->vv_data in saa7146_vv_release(), which could lead to a NULL
    pointer dereference on failure of saa7146_vv_init().
    
    Fix this bug by adding a check of saa7146_vv_init().
    
    This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
    differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
    (e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
    inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
    the callers, so they constitute bugs.
    
    Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false

    [ Upstream commit 2cbad989033bff0256675c38f96f5faab852af4b ]
    
    The WARN_ONCE() in bpf_warn_invalid_xdp_action() can be triggered by
    any bugged program, and even attaching a correct program to a NIC
    not supporting the given action.
    
    The resulting splat, beyond polluting the logs, fouls automated tools:
    e.g. a syzkaller reproducers using an XDP program returning an
    unsupported action will never pass validation.
    
    Replace the WARN_ONCE with a less intrusive pr_warn_once().

    ath10k: Fix tx hanging
    
    [ Upstream commit e8a91863eba3966a447d2daa1526082d52b5db2a ]
    
    While running stress tests in roaming scenarios (switching ap's every 5
    seconds, we discovered a issue which leads to tx hangings of exactly 5
    seconds while or after scanning for new accesspoints. We found out that
    this hanging is triggered by ath10k_mac_wait_tx_complete since the
    empty_tx_wq was not wake when the num_tx_pending counter reaches zero.
    To fix this, we simply move the wake_up call to htt_tx_dec_pending,
    since this call was missed on several locations within the ath10k code.

    iwlwifi: mvm: synchronize with FW after multicast commands
    
    [ Upstream commit db66abeea3aefed481391ecc564fb7b7fb31d742 ]
    
    If userspace installs a lot of multicast groups very quickly, then
    we may run out of command queue space as we send the updates in an
    asynchronous fashion (due to locking concerns), and the CPU can
    create them faster than the firmware can process them. This is true
    even when mac80211 has a work struct that gets scheduled.
    
    Fix this by synchronizing with the firmware after sending all those
    commands - outside of the iteration we can send a synchronous echo
    command that just has the effect of the CPU waiting for the prior
    asynchronous commands to finish. This also will cause fewer of the
    commands to be sent to the firmware overall, because the work will
    only run once when rescheduled multiple times while it's running.

    media: saa7146: hexium_orion: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in hexium_attach()
    
    [ Upstream commit 348df8035301dd212e3cc2860efe4c86cb0d3303 ]
    
    In hexium_attach(dev, info), saa7146_vv_init() is called to allocate
    a new memory for dev->vv_data. In hexium_detach(), saa7146_vv_release()
    will be called and there is a dereference of dev->vv_data in
    saa7146_vv_release(), which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference
    on failure of saa7146_vv_init() according to the following logic.
    
    Both hexium_attach() and hexium_detach() are callback functions of
    the variable 'extension', so there exists a possible call chain directly
    from hexium_attach() to hexium_detach():
    
    hexium_attach(dev, info) -- fail to alloc memory to dev->vv_data
            |                               in saa7146_vv_init().
            |
            |
    hexium_detach() -- a dereference of dev->vv_data in saa7146_vv_release()
    
    Fix this bug by adding a check of saa7146_vv_init().
    
    This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
    differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
    (e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
    inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
    the callers, so they constitute bugs.
    
    Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
    positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
    the bug.
    
    Builds with CONFIG_VIDEO_HEXIUM_ORION=m show no new warnings,

    [ Upstream commit c8ed7d2f614cd8b315981d116c7a2fb01829500d ]
    
    Some uvc devices appear to require the maximum allowed USB timeout
    for GET_CUR/SET_CUR requests.
    
    So lets just bump the UVC control timeout to 5 seconds which is the
    same as the usb ctrl get/set defaults:
    USB_CTRL_GET_TIMEOUT 5000
    USB_CTRL_SET_TIMEOUT 5000
    
    It fixes the following runtime warnings:
       Failed to query (GET_CUR) UVC control 11 on unit 2: -110 (exp. 1).
       Failed to query (SET_CUR) UVC control 3 on unit 2: -110 (exp. 2).

    rsi: Fix out-of-bounds read in rsi_read_pkt()
    
    [ Upstream commit f1cb3476e48b60c450ec3a1d7da0805bffc6e43a ]
    
    rsi_get_* functions rely on an offset variable from usb
    input. The size of usb input is RSI_MAX_RX_USB_PKT_SIZE(3000),
    while 2-byte offset can be up to 0xFFFF. Thus a large offset
    can cause out-of-bounds read.
    
    The patch adds a bound checking condition when rcv_pkt_len is 0,
    indicating it's USB. It's unclear whether this is triggerable
    from other type of bus. The following check might help in that case.
    offset > rcv_pkt_len - FRAME_DESC_SZ
    
    The bug is trigerrable with conpromised/malfunctioning USB devices.
    I tested the patch with the crashing input and got no more bug report.
    
    Attached is the KASAN report from fuzzing.

    mwifiex: Fix skb_over_panic in mwifiex_usb_recv()
    
    [ Upstream commit 04d80663f67ccef893061b49ec8a42ff7045ae84 ]
    
    Currently, with an unknown recv_type, mwifiex_usb_recv
    just return -1 without restoring the skb. Next time
    mwifiex_usb_rx_complete is invoked with the same skb,
    calling skb_put causes skb_over_panic.
    
    The bug is triggerable with a compromised/malfunctioning
    usb device. After applying the patch, skb_over_panic
    no longer shows up with the same input.

    gpiolib: acpi: Do not set the IRQ type if the IRQ is already in use
    
    [ Upstream commit bdfd6ab8fdccd8b138837efff66f4a1911496378 ]
    
    If the IRQ is already in use, then acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get_by() really
    should not change the type underneath the current owner.
    
    I specifically hit an issue with this an a Chuwi Hi8 Super (CWI509) Bay
    Trail tablet, when the Boot OS selection in the BIOS is set to Android.
    In this case _STA for a MAX17047 ACPI I2C device wrongly returns 0xf and
    the _CRS resources for this device include a GpioInt pointing to a GPIO
    already in use by an _AEI handler, with a different type then specified
    in the _CRS for the MAX17047 device. Leading to the acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get()
    call done by the i2c-core-acpi.c code changing the type breaking the
    _AEI handler.
    
    Now this clearly is a bug in the DSDT of this tablet (in Android mode),
    but in general calling irq_set_irq_type() on an IRQ which already is
    in use seems like a bad idea.

    [ Upstream commit 11632d4aa2b3f126790e81a4415d6c23103cf8bb ]
    
    In the configuration used by the b850v3, the STDP2690 is used to read EDID
    data whilst it's the STDP4028 which can detect when monitors are connected.
    
    This can result in problems at boot with monitors connected when the
    STDP4028 is probed first, a monitor is detected and an attempt is made to
    read the EDID data before the STDP2690 has probed:

    mlxsw: pci: Add shutdown method in PCI driver
    
    [ Upstream commit c1020d3cf4752f61a6a413f632ea2ce2370e150d ]
    
    On an arm64 platform with the Spectrum ASIC, after loading and executing
    a new kernel via kexec, the following trace [1] is observed. This seems
    to be caused by the fact that the device is not properly shutdown before
    executing the new kernel.
    
    Fix this by implementing a shutdown method which mirrors the remove
    method, as recommended by the kexec maintainer [2][3].

commit b8b6e40f5f95c40e186bc32c163241b9fb2f2541
Author: Zheyu Ma <zheyuma97@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue May 11 10:00:03 2021 +0100

    media: b2c2: Add missing check in flexcop_pci_isr:
    
    [ Upstream commit b13203032e679674c7c518f52a7ec0801ca3a829 ]
    
    A out-of-bounds bug can be triggered by an interrupt, the reason for
    this bug is the lack of checking of register values.
    
    In flexcop_pci_isr, the driver reads value from a register and uses it as
    a dma address. Finally, this address will be passed to the count parameter
    of find_next_packet. If this value is larger than the size of dma, the

    usb: gadget: f_fs: Use stream_open() for endpoint files
    
    [ Upstream commit c76ef96fc00eb398c8fc836b0eb2f82bcc619dc7 ]
    
    Function fs endpoint file operations are synchronized via an interruptible
    mutex wait. However we see threads that do ep file operations concurrently
    are getting blocked for the mutex lock in __fdget_pos(). This is an
    uninterruptible wait and we see hung task warnings and kernel panic
    if hung_task_panic systcl is enabled if host does not send/receive
    the data for long time.
    
    The reason for threads getting blocked in __fdget_pos() is due to
    the file position protection introduced by the commit 9c225f2655e3
    ("vfs: atomic f_pos accesses as per POSIX"). Since function fs
    endpoint files does not have the notion of the file position, switch
    to the stream mode. This will bypass the file position mutex and
    threads will be blocked in interruptible state for the function fs
    mutex.
    
    It should not affects user space as we are only changing the task state
    changes the task state from UNINTERRUPTIBLE to INTERRUPTIBLE while waiting
    for the USB transfers to be finished. However there is a slight change to
    the O_NONBLOCK behavior. Earlier threads that are using O_NONBLOCK are also
    getting blocked inside fdget_pos(). Now they reach to function fs and error
    code is returned. The non blocking behavior is actually honoured now.

    drm/nouveau/pmu/gm200-: avoid touching PMU outside of DEVINIT/PREOS/ACR
    
    [ Upstream commit 1d2271d2fb85e54bfc9630a6c30ac0feb9ffb983 ]
    
    There have been reports of the WFI timing out on some boards, and a
    patch was proposed to just remove it.  This stuff is rather fragile,
    and I believe the WFI might be needed with our FW prior to GM200.
    
    However, we probably should not be touching PMU during init on GPUs
    where we depend on NVIDIA FW, outside of limited circumstances, so
    this should be a somewhat safer change that achieves the desired
    result.

    ar5523: Fix null-ptr-deref with unexpected WDCMSG_TARGET_START reply
    
    [ Upstream commit ae80b6033834342601e99f74f6a62ff5092b1cee ]
    
    Unexpected WDCMSG_TARGET_START replay can lead to null-ptr-deref
    when ar->tx_cmd->odata is NULL. The patch adds a null check to
    prevent such case.

    I found the bug using a custome USBFuzz port. It's a research work
    to fuzz USB stack/drivers. I modified it to fuzz ath9k driver only,
    providing hand-crafted usb descriptors to QEMU.
    
    After fixing the code (fourth byte in usb packet) to WDCMSG_TARGET_START,
    I got the null-ptr-deref bug. I believe the bug is triggerable whenever
    cmd->odata is NULL. After patching, I tested with the same input and no
    longer see the KASAN report.
    
    This was NOT tested on a real device.

    The issue is that we received a DLM message for a user lock but the
    destination lock is a kernel lock. Note that the address which is trying
    to derefence is 00000000deadbeef, which is in a kernel lock
    lkb->lkb_astparam, this field should never be derefenced by the DLM
    kernel stack. In case of a user lock lkb->lkb_astparam is lkb->lkb_ua
    (memory is shared by a union field). The struct lkb_ua will be handled
    by the DLM kernel stack but on a kernel lock it will contain invalid
    data and ends in most likely crashing the kernel.
    
    It can be reproduced with two cluster nodes.

    iommu/iova: Fix race between FQ timeout and teardown
    
    [ Upstream commit d7061627d701c90e1cac1e1e60c45292f64f3470 ]
    
    It turns out to be possible for hotplugging out a device to reach the
    stage of tearing down the device's group and default domain before the
    domain's flush queue has drained naturally. At this point, it is then
    possible for the timeout to expire just before the del_timer() call
    in free_iova_flush_queue(), such that we then proceed to free the FQ
    resources while fq_flush_timeout() is still accessing them on another
    CPU. Crashes due to this have been observed in the wild while removing
    NVMe devices.
    
    Close the race window by using del_timer_sync() to safely wait for any
    active timeout handler to finish before we start to free things. We
    already avoid any locking in free_iova_flush_queue() since the FQ is
    supposed to be inactive anyway, so the potential deadlock scenario does
    not apply.

    RDMA/core: Let ib_find_gid() continue search even after empty entry
    
    [ Upstream commit 483d805191a23191f8294bbf9b4e94836f5d92e4 ]
    
    Currently, ib_find_gid() will stop searching after encountering the first
    empty GID table entry. This behavior is wrong since neither IB nor RoCE
    spec enforce tightly packed GID tables.
    
    For example, when a valid GID entry exists at index N, and if a GID entry
    is empty at index N-1, ib_find_gid() will fail to find the valid entry.
    
    Fix it by making ib_find_gid() continue searching even after encountering
    missing entries.

    iommu/io-pgtable-arm: Fix table descriptor paddr formatting
    
    [ Upstream commit 9abe2ac834851a7d0b0756e295cf7a292c45ca53 ]
    
    Table descriptors were being installed without properly formatting the
    address using paddr_to_iopte, which does not match up with the
    iopte_deref in __arm_lpae_map. This is incorrect for the LPAE pte
    format, as it does not handle the high bits properly.
    
    This was found on Apple T6000 DARTs, which require a new pte format
    (different shift); adding support for that to
    paddr_to_iopte/iopte_to_paddr caused it to break badly, as even <48-bit
    addresses would end up incorrect in that case.

    [ Upstream commit 49f893253ab43566e34332a969324531fea463f6 ]
    
    Commit f37fe2f9987b ("ASoC: uniphier: add support for UniPhier AIO common
    driver") adds configs SND_SOC_UNIPHIER_{LD11,PXS2}, which select the
    non-existing config SND_SOC_UNIPHIER_AIO_DMA.
    
    Hence, ./scripts/checkkconfigsymbols.py warns:
    
      SND_SOC_UNIPHIER_AIO_DMA
      Referencing files: sound/soc/uniphier/Kconfig
    
    Probably, there is actually no further config intended to be selected
    here. So, just drop selecting the non-existing config.

    ext4: avoid trim error on fs with small groups
    
    [ Upstream commit 173b6e383d2a204c9921ffc1eca3b87aa2106c33 ]
    
    A user reported FITRIM ioctl failing for him on ext4 on some devices
    without apparent reason.  After some debugging we've found out that
    these devices (being LVM volumes) report rather large discard
    granularity of 42MB and the filesystem had 1k blocksize and thus group
    size of 8MB. Because ext4 FITRIM implementation puts discard
    granularity into minlen, ext4_trim_fs() declared the trim request as
    invalid. However just silently doing nothing seems to be a more
    appropriate reaction to such combination of parameters since user did
    not specify anything wrong.

    net: mcs7830: handle usb read errors properly
    
    [ Upstream commit d668769eb9c52b150753f1653f7f5a0aeb8239d2 ]
    
    Syzbot reported uninit value in mcs7830_bind(). The problem was in
    missing validation check for bytes read via usbnet_read_cmd().
    
    usbnet_read_cmd() internally calls usb_control_msg(), that returns
    number of bytes read. Code should validate that requested number of bytes
    was actually read.
    
    So, this patch adds missing size validation check inside
    mcs7830_get_reg() to prevent uninit value bugs

    fsl/fman: Check for null pointer after calling devm_ioremap
    
    [ Upstream commit d5a73ec96cc57cf67e51b12820fc2354e7ca46f8 ]
    
    As the possible failure of the allocation, the devm_ioremap() may return
    NULL pointer.
    Take tgec_initialization() as an example.
    If allocation fails, the params->base_addr will be NULL pointer and will
    be assigned to tgec->regs in tgec_config().
    Then it will cause the dereference of NULL pointer in set_mac_address(),
    which is called by tgec_init().
    Therefore, it should be better to add the sanity check after the calling
    of the devm_ioremap().

    [ Upstream commit 2e81948177d769106754085c3e03534e6cc1f623 ]
    
    As the possible alloc failure of devm_kcalloc(), it could return null
    pointer.
    Therefore, 'strings' should be checked and return NULL if alloc fails to
    prevent the dereference of the NULL pointer.
    Also, the caller should also deal with the return value of the
    gb_generate_enum_strings() and return -ENOMEM if returns NULL.
    Moreover, because the memory allocated with devm_kzalloc() will be
    freed automatically when the last reference to the device is dropped,
    the 'gbe' in gbaudio_tplg_create_enum_kctl() and
    gbaudio_tplg_create_enum_ctl() do not need to free manually.
    But the 'control' in gbaudio_tplg_create_widget() and
    gbaudio_tplg_process_kcontrols() has a specially error handle to
    cleanup.
    So it should be better to cleanup 'control' when fails.

    ppp: ensure minimum packet size in ppp_write()
    
    [ Upstream commit 44073187990d5629804ce0627525f6ea5cfef171 ]
    
    It seems pretty clear ppp layer assumed user space
    would always be kind to provide enough data
    in their write() to a ppp device.
    
    This patch makes sure user provides at least
    2 bytes.
    
    It adds PPP_PROTO_LEN macro that could replace
    in net-next many occurrences of hard-coded 2 value.
    
    I replaced only one occurrence to ease backports
    to stable kernels.
    
    The bug manifests in the following report:

    netfilter: ipt_CLUSTERIP: fix refcount leak in clusterip_tg_check()
    
    [ Upstream commit d94a69cb2cfa77294921aae9afcfb866e723a2da ]
    
    The issue takes place in one error path of clusterip_tg_check(). When
    memcmp() returns nonzero, the function simply returns the error code,
    forgetting to decrease the reference count of a clusterip_config
    object, which is bumped earlier by clusterip_config_find_get(). This
    may incur reference count leak.
    
    Fix this issue by decrementing the refcount of the object in specific
    error path.

    pcmcia: rsrc_nonstatic: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in nonstatic_find_mem_region()
    
    [ Upstream commit 977d2e7c63c3d04d07ba340b39987742e3241554 ]
    
    In nonstatic_find_mem_region(), pcmcia_make_resource() is assigned to
    res and used in pci_bus_alloc_resource(). There a dereference of res
    in pci_bus_alloc_resource(), which could lead to a NULL pointer
    dereference on failure of pcmcia_make_resource().
    
    Fix this bug by adding a check of res.
    
    This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
    differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
    (e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
    inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
    the callers, so they constitute bugs.
    
    Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
    positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
    the bug.
    
    Builds with CONFIG_PCCARD_NONSTATIC=y show no new warnings,
    and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.

    [ Upstream commit 9b58e976b3b391c0cf02e038d53dd0478ed3013c ]
    
    When rt_runtime is modified from -1 to a valid control value, it may
    cause the task to be throttled all the time. Operations like the following
    will trigger the bug. E.g:
    
      1. echo -1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us
      2. Run a FIFO task named A that executes while(1)
      3. echo 950000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us
    
    When rt_runtime is -1, The rt period timer will not be activated when task
    A enqueued. And then the task will be throttled after setting rt_runtime to
    950,000. The task will always be throttled because the rt period timer is
    not activated.

    media: si2157: Fix "warm" tuner state detection
    
    [ Upstream commit a6441ea29cb2c9314654e093a1cd8020b9b851c8 ]
    
    Commit e955f959ac52 ("media: si2157: Better check for running tuner in
    init") completely broke the "warm" tuner detection of the si2157 driver
    due to a simple endian error: The Si2157 CRYSTAL_TRIM property code is
    0x0402 and needs to be transmitted LSB first. However, it was inserted
    MSB first, causing the warm detection to always fail and spam the kernel
    log with tuner initialization messages each time the DVB frontend
    device was closed and reopened:
    
    [  312.215682] si2157 16-0060: found a 'Silicon Labs Si2157-A30'
    [  312.264334] si2157 16-0060: firmware version: 3.0.5
    [  342.248593] si2157 16-0060: found a 'Silicon Labs Si2157-A30'
    [  342.295743] si2157 16-0060: firmware version: 3.0.5
    [  372.328574] si2157 16-0060: found a 'Silicon Labs Si2157-A30'
    [  372.385035] si2157 16-0060: firmware version: 3.0.5
    
    Also, the reinitializations were observed disturb _other_ tuners on
    multi-tuner cards such as the Hauppauge WinTV-QuadHD, leading to missed
    or errored packets when one of the other DVB frontend devices on that
    card was opened.
    
    Fix the order of the property code bytes to make the warm detection work
    again, also reducing the tuner initialization message in the kernel log
    to once per power-on, as well as fixing the interference with other
    tuners.

    media: saa7146: mxb: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in mxb_attach()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0407c49ebe330333478440157c640fffd986f41b ]
    
    In mxb_attach(dev, info), saa7146_vv_init() is called to allocate a
    new memory for dev->vv_data. saa7146_vv_release() will be called on
    failure of mxb_probe(dev). There is a dereference of dev->vv_data
    in saa7146_vv_release(), which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference
    on failure of saa7146_vv_init().
    
    Fix this bug by adding a check of saa7146_vv_init().
    
    This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
    differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
    (e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
    inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
    the callers, so they constitute bugs.
    
    Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
    positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
    the bug.
    
    Builds with CONFIG_VIDEO_MXB=m show no new warnings,
    and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.

    floppy: Fix hang in watchdog when disk is ejected
    
    [ Upstream commit fb48febce7e30baed94dd791e19521abd2c3fd83 ]
    
    When the watchdog detects a disk change, it calls cancel_activity(),
    which in turn tries to cancel the fd_timer delayed work.
    
    In the above scenario, fd_timer_fn is set to fd_watchdog(), meaning
    it is trying to cancel its own work.
    This results in a hang as cancel_delayed_work_sync() is waiting for the
    watchdog (itself) to return, which never happens.
    
    This can be reproduced relatively consistently by attempting to read a
    broken floppy, and ejecting it while IO is being attempted and retried.
    
    To resolve this, this patch calls cancel_delayed_work() instead, which
    cancels the work without waiting for the watchdog to return and finish.
    
    Before this regression was introduced, the code in this section used
    del_timer(), and not del_timer_sync() to delete the watchdog timer.

    serial: amba-pl011: do not request memory region twice
    
    [ Upstream commit d1180405c7b5c7a1c6bde79d5fc24fe931430737 ]
    
    With commit 3873e2d7f63a ("drivers: PL011: refactor pl011_probe()") the
    function devm_ioremap() called from pl011_setup_port() was replaced with
    devm_ioremap_resource(). Since this function not only remaps but also
    requests the ports io memory region it now collides with the .config_port()
    callback which requests the same region at uart port registration.
    
    Since devm_ioremap_resource() already claims the memory successfully, the
    request in .config_port() fails.
    
    Later at uart port deregistration the attempt to release the unclaimed
    memory also fails. The failure results in a “Trying to free nonexistent
    resource" warning.
    
    Fix these issues by removing the callbacks that implement the redundant
    memory allocation/release. Also make sure that changing the drivers io
    memory base address via TIOCSSERIAL is not allowed any more.

    The base address of uartlite registers could be 64 bit address which is from
    device resource. When ulite_probe() calls ulite_assign(), this 64 bit
    address is casted to 32-bit. The fix is to replace "u32" type with
    "phys_addr_t" type for the base address in ulite_assign() argument list.

    [ Upstream commit 28b78ecffea8078d81466b2e01bb5a154509f1ba ]
    
    This makes 'bridge-nf-filter-pppoe-tagged' sysctl work for
    bridged traffic.
    
    Looking at the original commit it doesn't appear this ever worked:
    
     static unsigned int br_nf_post_routing(unsigned int hook, struct sk_buff **pskb,
    [..]
            if (skb->protocol == htons(ETH_P_8021Q)) {
                    skb_pull(skb, VLAN_HLEN);
                    skb->network_header += VLAN_HLEN;
    +       } else if (skb->protocol == htons(ETH_P_PPP_SES)) {
    +               skb_pull(skb, PPPOE_SES_HLEN);
    +               skb->network_header += PPPOE_SES_HLEN;
            }
     [..]
            NF_HOOK(... POST_ROUTING, ...)
    
    ... but the adjusted offsets are never restored.
    
    The alternative would be to rip this code out for good,
    but otoh we'd have to keep this anyway for the vlan handling
    (which works because vlan tag info is in the skb, not the packet
     payload).

    media: rcar-csi2: Correct the selection of hsfreqrange
    
    [ Upstream commit cee44d4fbacbbdfe62697ec94e76c6e4f726c5df ]
    
    hsfreqrange should be chosen based on the calculated mbps which
    is closer to the default bit rate  and within the range as per
    table[1]. But current calculation always selects first value which
    is greater than or equal to the calculated mbps which may lead
    to chosing a wrong range in some cases.
    
    For example for 360 mbps for H3/M3N
    Existing logic selects
    Calculated value 360Mbps : Default 400Mbps Range [368.125 -433.125 mbps]
    
    This hsfreqrange is out of range.
    
    The logic is changed to get the default value which is closest to the
    calculated value [1]
    
    Calculated value 360Mbps : Default 350Mbps  Range [320.625 -380.625 mpbs]
    
    [1] specs r19uh0105ej0200-r-car-3rd-generation.pdf [Table 25.9]
    
    Please note that According to Renesas in Table 25.9 the range for
    220 default value is corrected as below
    
     |Range (Mbps)     |  Default  Bit rate (Mbps) |

    The driver wrongly assummed that tx_submit() will start the transfer,
    which is not the case, now that the at_xdmac driver is fixed. tx_submit
    is supposed to push the current transaction descriptor to a pending queue,
    waiting for issue_pending to be called. issue_pending must start the

    return a positive cookie at tx_submit() method. In case the controller
    drivers will implement sanity checks and return errors, print a message
    so that the client will be informed that something went wrong at
    tx_submit() level.

    clk: bcm-2835: Remove rounding up the dividers
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ca011ef4af48a7af7b15afd8a4a44039dd04cea ]
    
    The driver, once it found a divider, tries to round it up by increasing
    the least significant bit of the fractional part by one when the
    round_up argument is set and there's a remainder.
    
    However, since it increases the divider it will actually reduce the
    clock rate below what we were asking for, leading to issues with
    clk_set_min_rate() that will complain that our rounded clock rate is
    below the minimum of the rate.
    
    Since the dividers are fairly precise already, let's remove that part so

    clk: bcm-2835: Pick the closest clock rate
    
    [ Upstream commit 5517357a4733d7cf7c17fc79d0530cfa47add372 ]
    
    The driver currently tries to pick the closest rate that is lower than
    the rate being requested.
    
    This causes an issue with clk_set_min_rate() since it actively checks
    for the rounded rate to be above the minimum that was just set.
    
    Let's change the logic a bit to pick the closest rate to the requested
    rate, no matter if it's actually higher or lower.

    ready), we leave a dangling drm_panel reference to freed memory. Clean

    shmem: fix a race between shmem_unused_huge_shrink and shmem_evict_inode
    
    commit 62c9827cbb996c2c04f615ecd783ce28bcea894b upstream.
    
    Fix a data race in commit 779750d20b93 ("shmem: split huge pages beyond
    i_size under memory pressure").
    
    Here are call traces causing race:
    
       Call Trace 1:

    A simple explanation:
    
    Image there are 3 items in the local list (@list).  In the first
    traversal, A is not deleted from @list.
    
      1)    A->B->C
            ^
            |
            pos (leave)
    
    In the second traversal, B is deleted from @list.  Concurrently, A is
    deleted from @list through shmem_evict_inode() since last reference
    counter of inode is dropped by other thread.  Then the @list is corrupted.
    
      2)    A->B->C
            ^  ^
            |  |
         evict pos (drop)
    
    We should make sure the inode is either on the global list or deleted from
    any local list before iput().
    
    Fixed by moving inodes back to global list before we put them.

    PCI: Add function 1 DMA alias quirk for Marvell 88SE9125 SATA controller
    
    commit e445375882883f69018aa669b67cbb37ec873406 upstream.
    
    Like other SATA controller chips in the Marvell 88SE91xx series, the
    Marvell 88SE9125 has the same DMA requester ID hardware bug that prevents
    it from working under IOMMU.  Add it to the list of devices that need the
    quirk.
    
    Without this patch, device initialization fails with DMA errors:
    
      ata8: softreset failed (1st FIS failed)
      DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 2
      DMAR: [DMA Write NO_PASID] Request device [03:00.1] fault addr 0xfffc0000 [fault reason 0x02] Present bit in context entry is clear

    After applying the patch, the controller can be successfully initialized:

    lkdtm: Fix content of section containing lkdtm_rodata_do_nothing()
    
    commit bc93a22a19eb2b68a16ecf04cdf4b2ed65aaf398 upstream.
    
    On a kernel without CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX, running EXEC_RODATA
    test leads to "Illegal instruction" failure.
    
    Looking at the content of rodata_objcopy.o, we see that the
    function content zeroes only:

               0:   00 00 00 00     .long 0x0
    
    Add the contents flag in order to keep the content of the section
    while renaming it.

    media: dib0700: fix undefined behavior in tuner shutdown
    
    commit f7b77ebe6d2f49c7747b2d619586d1aa33f9ea91 upstream.
    
    This fixes a problem where closing the tuner would leave it in a state
    where it would not tune to any channel when reopened. This problem was
    discovered as part of https://github.com/hselasky/webcamd/issues/16.
    
    Since adap->id is 0 or 1, this bit-shift overflows, which is undefined
    behavior. The driver still worked in practice as the overflow would in
    most environments result in 0, which rendered the line a no-op. When
    running the driver as part of webcamd however, the overflow could lead
    to 0xff due to optimizations by the compiler, which would, in the end,
    improperly shut down the tuner.
    
    The bug is a regression introduced in the commit referenced below. The
    present patch causes identical behavior to before that commit for
    adap->id equal to 0 or 1. The driver does not contain support for
    dib0700 devices with more adapters, assuming such even exist.
    
    Tests have been performed with the Xbox One Digital TV Tuner on amd64.
    Not all dib0700 devices are expected to be affected by the regression;
    this code path is only taken by those with incorrect endpoint numbers.

    rtc: cmos: take rtc_lock while reading from CMOS
    
    commit 454f47ff464325223129b9b5b8d0b61946ec704d upstream.
    
    Reading from the CMOS involves writing to the index register and then
    reading from the data register. Therefore access to the CMOS has to be
    serialized with rtc_lock. This invocation of CMOS_READ was not
    serialized, which could cause trouble when other code is accessing CMOS
    at the same time.
    
    Use spin_lock_irq() like the rest of the function.
    
    Nothing in kernel modifies the RTC_DM_BINARY bit, so there could be a
    separate pair of spin_lock_irq() / spin_unlock_irq() before doing the
    math.

    x86/gpu: Reserve stolen memory for first integrated Intel GPU
    
    commit 9c494ca4d3a535f9ca11ad6af1813983c1c6cbdd upstream.
    
    "Stolen memory" is memory set aside for use by an Intel integrated GPU.
    The intel_graphics_quirks() early quirk reserves this memory when it is
    called for a GPU that appears in the intel_early_ids[] table of integrated
    GPUs.
    
    Previously intel_graphics_quirks() was marked as QFLAG_APPLY_ONCE, so it
    was called only for the first Intel GPU found.  If a discrete GPU happened
    to be enumerated first, intel_graphics_quirks() was called for it but not
    for any integrated GPU found later.  Therefore, stolen memory for such an
    integrated GPU was never reserved.
    
    For example, this problem occurs in this Alderlake-P (integrated) + DG2
    (discrete) topology where the DG2 is found first, but stolen memory is
    associated with the integrated GPU:
    
      - 00:01.0 Bridge
        `- 03:00.0 DG2 discrete GPU
      - 00:02.0 Integrated GPU (with stolen memory)
    
    Remove the QFLAG_APPLY_ONCE flag and call intel_graphics_quirks() for every
    Intel GPU.  Reserve stolen memory for the first GPU that appears in
    intel_early_ids[].

    nfc: llcp: fix NULL error pointer dereference on sendmsg() after failed bind()
    
    commit dded08927ca3c31a5c37f8e7f95fe98770475dd4 upstream.
    
    Syzbot detected a NULL pointer dereference of nfc_llcp_sock->dev pointer
    (which is a 'struct nfc_dev *') with calls to llcp_sock_sendmsg() after
    a failed llcp_sock_bind(). The message being sent is a SOCK_DGRAM.

       ...
    
    The issue was visible only with multiple simultaneous calls to bind() and
    sendmsg(), which resulted in most of the bind() calls to fail.  The
    bind() was failing on checking if there is available WKS/SDP/SAP
    (respective bit in 'struct nfc_llcp_local' fields).  When there was no
    available WKS/SDP/SAP, the bind returned error but the sendmsg() to such
    socket was able to trigger mentioned NULL pointer dereference of
    nfc_llcp_sock->dev.
    
    The code looks simply racy and currently it protects several paths
    against race with checks for (!nfc_llcp_sock->local) which is NULL-ified
    in error paths of bind().  The llcp_sock_sendmsg() did not have such
    check but called function nfc_llcp_send_ui_frame() had, although not
    protected with lock_sock().
    
    Therefore the race could look like (same socket is used all the time):
      CPU0                                     CPU1
      ====                                     ====
      llcp_sock_bind()
      - lock_sock()
        - success
      - release_sock()
      - return 0
                                               llcp_sock_sendmsg()
                                               - lock_sock()
                                               - release_sock()
      llcp_sock_bind(), same socket
      - lock_sock()
        - error
                                               - nfc_llcp_send_ui_frame()
                                                 - if (!llcp_sock->local)
        - llcp_sock->local = NULL
        - nfc_put_device(dev)
                                                 - dereference llcp_sock->dev
      - release_sock()
      - return -ERRNO
    
    The nfc_llcp_send_ui_frame() checked llcp_sock->local outside of the
    lock, which is racy and ineffective check.  Instead, its caller
    llcp_sock_sendmsg(), should perform the check inside lock_sock().

    HID: wacom: Avoid using stale array indicies to read contact count
    
    commit 20f3cf5f860f9f267a6a6e5642d3d0525edb1814 upstream.
    
    If we ever see a touch report with contact count data we initialize
    several variables used to read the contact count in the pre-report
    phase. These variables are never reset if we process a report which
    doesn't contain a contact count, however. This can cause the pre-
    report function to trigger a read of arbitrary memory (e.g. NULL
    if we're lucky) and potentially crash the driver.
    
    This commit restores resetting of the variables back to default
    "none" values that were used prior to the commit mentioned
    below.

    HID: wacom: Ignore the confidence flag when a touch is removed
    
    commit df03e9bd6d4806619b4cdc91a3d7695818a8e2b7 upstream.
    
    AES hardware may internally re-classify a contact that it thought was
    intentional as a palm. Intentional contacts are reported as "down" with
    the confidence bit set. When this re-classification occurs, however, the
    state transitions to "up" with the confidence bit cleared. This kind of
    transition appears to be legal according to Microsoft docs, but we do
    not handle it correctly. Because the confidence bit is clear, we don't
    call `wacom_wac_finger_slot` and update userspace. This causes hung
    touches that confuse userspace and interfere with pen arbitration.
    
    This commit adds a special case to ignore the confidence flag if a contact
    is reported as removed. This ensures we do not leave a hung touch if one
    of these re-classification events occured. Ideally we'd have some way to
    also let userspace know that the touch has been re-classified as a palm
    and needs to be canceled, but that's not possible right now :)

    HID: wacom: Reset expected and received contact counts at the same time
    
    commit 546e41ac994cc185ef3de610ca849a294b5df3ba upstream.
    
    These two values go hand-in-hand and must be valid for the driver to
    behave correctly. We are currently lazy about updating the values and
    rely on the "expected" code flow to take care of making sure they're
    valid at the point they're needed. The "expected" flow changed somewhat
    with commit f8b6a74719b5 ("HID: wacom: generic: Support multiple tools
    per report"), however. This led to problems with the DTH-2452 due (in
    part) to *all* contacts being fully processed -- even those past the
    expected contact count. Specifically, the received count gets reset to
    0 once all expected fingers are processed, but not the expected count.
    The rest of the contacts in the report are then *also* processed since
    now the driver thinks we've only processed 0 of N expected contacts.
    
    Later commits such as 7fb0413baa7f (HID: wacom: Use "Confidence" flag to
    prevent reporting invalid contacts) worked around the DTH-2452 issue by
    skipping the invalid contacts at the end of the report, but this is not
    a complete fix. The confidence flag cannot be relied on when a contact
    is removed (see the following patch), and dealing with that condition
    re-introduces the DTH-2452 issue unless we also address this contact
    count laziness. By resetting expected and received counts at the same
    time we ensure the driver understands that there are 0 more contacts
    expected in the report. Similarly, we also make sure to reset the
    received count if for some reason we're out of sync in the pre-report
    phase.

    HID: uhid: Fix worker destroying device without any protection
    
    commit 4ea5763fb79ed89b3bdad455ebf3f33416a81624 upstream.
    
    uhid has to run hid_add_device() from workqueue context while allowing
    parallel use of the userspace API (which is protected with ->devlock).
    But hid_add_device() can fail. Currently, that is handled by immediately
    destroying the associated HID device, without using ->devlock - but if
    there are concurrent requests from userspace, that's wrong and leads to
    NULL dereferences and/or memory corruption (via use-after-free).
    
    Fix it by leaving the HID device as-is in the worker. We can clean it up
    later, either in the UHID_DESTROY command handler or in the ->release()
    handler.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix silent output on Gigabyte X570 Aorus Master after reboot from Windows
    
    commit c1933008679586b20437280463110c967d66f865 upstream.
    
    This patch addresses an issue where after rebooting from Windows into Linux
    there would be no audio output.
    
    It turns out that the Realtek Audio driver on Windows changes some coeffs
    which are not being reset/reinitialized when rebooting the machine. As a
    result, there is no audio output until these coeffs are being reset to
    their initial state. This patch takes care of that by setting known-good
    (initial) values to the coeffs.
    
    We initially relied upon alc1220_fixup_clevo_p950() to fix some pins in the
    connection list. However, it also sets coef 0x7 which does not need to be
    touched. Furthermore, to prevent mixing device-specific quirks I introduced
    a new alc1220_fixup_gb_x570() which is heavily based on
    alc1220_fixup_clevo_p950() but does not set coeff 0x7 and fixes the coeffs
    that are actually needed instead.
    
    This new alc1220_fixup_gb_x570() is believed to also work for other boards,
    like the Gigabyte X570 Aorus Extreme and the newer Gigabyte Aorus X570S
    Master. However, as there is no way for me to test these I initially only
    enable this new behaviour for the mainboard I have which is the Gigabyte
    X570(non-S) Aorus Master.
    
    I tested this patch on the 5.15 branch as well as on master and it is
    working well for me.

    An initialised kobject must be freed using kobject_put() to avoid

    left the second one unchanged. This "fix" would however result in a NULL
    pointer dereference due to the release function also removing the never
    added entry from the fw_cfg_entry_cache list. This has now been
    addressed.
    
    Fix the remaining kobject leak by restoring the common error path and
    adding the missing kobject_put().

    firmware: qemu_fw_cfg: fix NULL-pointer deref on duplicate entries
    
    commit d3e305592d69e21e36b76d24ca3c01971a2d09be upstream.
    
    Commit fe3c60684377 ("firmware: Fix a reference count leak.") "fixed"
    a kobject leak in the file registration helper by properly calling
    kobject_put() for the entry in case registration of the object fails
    (e.g. due to a name collision).
    
    This would however result in a NULL pointer dereference when the
    release function tries to remove the never added entry from the
    fw_cfg_entry_cache list.
    
    Fix this by moving the list-removal out of the release function.

    rtlwifi: rtl8192cu: Fix WARNING when calling local_irq_restore() with interrupts enabled
    
    commit 8b144dedb928e4e2f433a328d58f44c3c098d63e upstream.
    
    Syzbot reports the following WARNING:
    
    [200~raw_local_irq_restore() called with IRQs enabled
    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1206 at kernel/locking/irqflag-debug.c:10
       warn_bogus_irq_restore+0x1d/0x20 kernel/locking/irqflag-debug.c:10
    
    Hardware initialization for the rtl8188cu can run for as long as 350 ms,
    and the routine may be called with interrupts disabled. To avoid locking
    the machine for this long, the current routine saves the interrupt flags
    and enables local interrupts. The problem is that it restores the flags
    at the end without disabling local interrupts first.
    
    This patch fixes commit a53268be0cb9 ("rtlwifi: rtl8192cu: Fix too long
    disable of IRQs").

    media: uvcvideo: fix division by zero at stream start
    
    commit 8aa637bf6d70d2fb2ad4d708d8b9dd02b1c095df upstream.
    
    Add the missing bulk-endpoint max-packet sanity check to
    uvc_video_start_transfer() to avoid division by zero in
    uvc_alloc_urb_buffers() in case a malicious device has broken
    descriptors (or when doing descriptor fuzz testing).
    
    Note that USB core will reject URBs submitted for endpoints with zero
    wMaxPacketSize but that drivers doing packet-size calculations still
    need to handle this (cf. commit 2548288b4fb0 ("USB: Fix: Don't skip
    endpoint descriptors with maxpacket=0")).

    KVM: s390: Clarify SIGP orders versus STOP/RESTART
    
    commit 812de04661c4daa7ac385c0dfd62594540538034 upstream.
    
    With KVM_CAP_S390_USER_SIGP, there are only five Signal Processor
    orders (CONDITIONAL EMERGENCY SIGNAL, EMERGENCY SIGNAL, EXTERNAL CALL,
    SENSE, and SENSE RUNNING STATUS) which are intended for frequent use
    and thus are processed in-kernel. The remainder are sent to userspace
    with the KVM_CAP_S390_USER_SIGP capability. Of those, three orders
    (RESTART, STOP, and STOP AND STORE STATUS) have the potential to
    inject work back into the kernel, and thus are asynchronous.
    
    Let's look for those pending IRQs when processing one of the in-kernel
    SIGP orders, and return BUSY (CC2) if one is in process. This is in
    agreement with the Principles of Operation, which states that only one
    order can be "active" on a CPU at a time.

    orangefs: Fix the size of a memory allocation in orangefs_bufmap_alloc()
    
    commit 40a74870b2d1d3d44e13b3b73c6571dd34f5614d upstream.
    
    'buffer_index_array' really looks like a bitmap. So it should be allocated
    as such.
    When kzalloc is called, a number of bytes is expected, but a number of
    longs is passed instead.
    
    In get(), if not enough memory is allocated, un-allocated memory may be
    read or written.
    
    So use bitmap_zalloc() to safely allocate the correct memory size and
    avoid un-expected behavior.
    
    While at it, change the corresponding kfree() into bitmap_free() to keep
    the semantic.

    kbuild: Add $(KBUILD_HOSTLDFLAGS) to 'has_libelf' test
    
    commit f634ca650f724347892068489c7920631a3aac6a upstream.
    
    Normally, invocations of $(HOSTCC) include $(KBUILD_HOSTLDFLAGS), which
    in turn includes $(HOSTLDFLAGS), which allows users to pass in their own
    flags when linking. However, the 'has_libelf' test does not, meaning
    that if a user requests a specific linker via HOSTLDFLAGS=-fuse-ld=...,
    it is not respected and the build might error.
    
    For example, if a user building with clang wants to use all of the LLVM
    tools without any GNU tools, they might remove all of the GNU tools from
    their system or PATH then build with
    
    $ make HOSTLDFLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1
    
    which says use all of the LLVM tools, the integrated assembler, and
    ld.lld for linking host executables. Without this change, the build will
    error because $(HOSTCC) uses its default linker, rather than the one
    requested via -fuse-ld=..., which is GNU ld in clang's case in a default
    configuration.
    
    error: Cannot generate ORC metadata for CONFIG_UNWINDER_ORC=y, please
    install libelf-dev, libelf-devel or elfutils-libelf-devel
    make[1]: *** [Makefile:1260: prepare-objtool] Error 1
    
    Add $(KBUILD_HOSTLDFLAGS) to the 'has_libelf' test so that the linker
    choice is respected.

    drm/i915: Avoid bitwise vs logical OR warning in snb_wm_latency_quirk()
    
    commit 2e70570656adfe1c5d9a29940faa348d5f132199 upstream.
    
    A new warning in clang points out a place in this file where a bitwise
    OR is being used with boolean types:
    
    drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_pm.c:3066:12: warning: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
            changed = ilk_increase_wm_latency(dev_priv, dev_priv->wm.pri_latency, 12) |
                      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    This construct is intentional, as it allows every one of the calls to
    ilk_increase_wm_latency() to occur (instead of short circuiting with
    logical OR) while still caring about the result of each call.
    
    To make this clearer to the compiler, use the '|=' operator to assign
    the result of each ilk_increase_wm_latency() call to changed, which
    keeps the meaning of the code the same but makes it obvious that every
    one of these calls is expected to happen.

    staging: wlan-ng: Avoid bitwise vs logical OR warning in hfa384x_usb_throttlefn()
    
    commit 502408a61f4b7eb4713f44bd77f4a48e6cb1b59a upstream.
    
    A new warning in clang points out a place in this file where a bitwise
    OR is being used with boolean expressions:
    
    In file included from drivers/staging/wlan-ng/prism2usb.c:2:
    drivers/staging/wlan-ng/hfa384x_usb.c:3787:7: warning: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
                ((test_and_clear_bit(THROTTLE_RX, &hw->usb_flags) &&
                ~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    drivers/staging/wlan-ng/hfa384x_usb.c:3787:7: note: cast one or both operands to int to silence this warning
    1 warning generated.
    
    The comment explains that short circuiting here is undesirable, as the
    calls to test_and_{clear,set}_bit() need to happen for both sides of the
    expression.
    
    Clang's suggestion would work to silence the warning but the readability
    of the expression would suffer even more. To clean up the warning and
    make the block more readable, use a variable for each side of the
    bitwise expression.

    random: fix data race on crng init time
    
    commit 009ba8568be497c640cab7571f7bfd18345d7b24 upstream.
    
    _extract_crng() does plain loads of crng->init_time and
    crng_global_init_time, which causes undefined behavior if
    crng_reseed() and RNDRESEEDCRNG modify these corrently.
    
    Use READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() to make the behavior defined.
    
    Don't fix the race on crng->init_time by protecting it with crng->lock,
    since it's not a problem for duplicate reseedings to occur.  I.e., the
    lockless access with READ_ONCE() is fine.

    random: fix data race on crng_node_pool
    
    commit 5d73d1e320c3fd94ea15ba5f79301da9a8bcc7de upstream.
    
    extract_crng() and crng_backtrack_protect() load crng_node_pool with a
    plain load, which causes undefined behavior if do_numa_crng_init()
    modifies it concurrently.
    
    Fix this by using READ_ONCE().  Note: as per the previous discussion
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20211219025139.31085-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/T/#u,
    READ_ONCE() is believed to be sufficient here, and it was requested that
    it be used here instead of smp_load_acquire().
    
    Also change do_numa_crng_init() to set crng_node_pool using
    cmpxchg_release() instead of mb() + cmpxchg(), as the former is
    sufficient here but is more lightweight.

    veth: Do not record rx queue hint in veth_xmit
    
    commit 710ad98c363a66a0cd8526465426c5c5f8377ee0 upstream.
    
    Laurent reported that they have seen a significant amount of TCP retransmissions
    at high throughput from applications residing in network namespaces talking to
    the outside world via veths. The drops were seen on the qdisc layer (fq_codel,
    as per systemd default) of the phys device such as ena or virtio_net due to all
    traffic hitting a _single_ TX queue _despite_ multi-queue device. (Note that the
    setup was _not_ using XDP on veths as the issue is generic.)
    
    More specifically, after edbea9220251 ("veth: Store queue_mapping independently
    of XDP prog presence") which made it all the way back to v4.19.184+,
    skb_record_rx_queue() would set skb->queue_mapping to 1 (given 1 RX and 1 TX
    queue by default for veths) instead of leaving at 0.
    
    This is eventually retained and callbacks like ena_select_queue() will also pick
    single queue via netdev_core_pick_tx()'s ndo_select_queue() once all the traffic
    is forwarded to that device via upper stack or other means. Similarly, for others
    not implementing ndo_select_queue() if XPS is disabled, netdev_pick_tx() might
    call into the skb_tx_hash() and check for prior skb_rx_queue_recorded() as well.
    
    In general, it is a _bad_ idea for virtual devices like veth to mess around with
    queue selection [by default]. Given dev->real_num_tx_queues is by default 1,
    the skb->queue_mapping was left untouched, and so prior to edbea9220251 the
    netdev_core_pick_tx() could do its job upon __dev_queue_xmit() on the phys device.
    
    Unbreak this and restore prior behavior by removing the skb_record_rx_queue()
    from veth_xmit() altogether.
    
    If the veth peer has an XDP program attached, then it would return the first RX
    queue index in xdp_md->rx_queue_index (unless configured in non-default manner).
    However, this is still better than breaking the generic case.

    USB: Fix "slab-out-of-bounds Write" bug in usb_hcd_poll_rh_status
    
    commit 1d7d4c07932e04355d6e6528d44a2f2c9e354346 upstream.
    
    When the USB core code for getting root-hub status reports was
    originally written, it was assumed that the hub driver would be its
    only caller.  But this isn't true now; user programs can use usbfs to
    communicate with root hubs and get status reports.  When they do this,
    they may use a transfer_buffer that is smaller than the data returned
    by the HCD, which will lead to a buffer overflow error when
    usb_hcd_poll_rh_status() tries to store the status data.  This was
    discovered by syzbot:
    
    BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in memcpy include/linux/fortify-string.h:225 [inline]
    BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in usb_hcd_poll_rh_status+0x5f4/0x780 drivers/usb/core/hcd.c:776
    Write of size 2 at addr ffff88801da403c0 by task syz-executor133/4062
    
    This patch fixes the bug by reducing the amount of status data if it
    won't fit in the transfer_buffer.  If some data gets discarded then
    the URB's completion status is set to -EOVERFLOW rather than 0, to let
    the user know what happened.

    USB: core: Fix bug in resuming hub's handling of wakeup requests
    
    commit 0f663729bb4afc92a9986b66131ebd5b8a9254d1 upstream.
    
    Bugzilla #213839 reports a 7-port hub that doesn't work properly when
    devices are plugged into some of the ports; the kernel goes into an
    unending disconnect/reinitialize loop as shown in the bug report.
    
    This "7-port hub" comprises two four-port hubs with one plugged into
    the other; the failures occur when a device is plugged into one of the
    downstream hub's ports.  (These hubs have other problems too.  For
    example, they bill themselves as USB-2.0 compliant but they only run
    at full speed.)
    
    It turns out that the failures are caused by bugs in both the kernel
    and the hub.  The hub's bug is that it reports a different
    bmAttributes value in its configuration descriptor following a remote
    wakeup (0xe0 before, 0xc0 after -- the wakeup-support bit has
    changed).
    
    The kernel's bug is inside the hub driver's resume handler.  When
    hub_activate() sees that one of the hub's downstream ports got a
    wakeup request from a child device, it notes this fact by setting the
    corresponding bit in the hub->change_bits variable.  But this variable
    is meant for connection changes, not wakeup events; setting it causes
    the driver to believe the downstream port has been disconnected and
    then connected again (in addition to having received a wakeup
    request).
    
    Because of this, the hub driver then tries to check whether the device
    currently plugged into the downstream port is the same as the device
    that had been attached there before.  Normally this check succeeds and
    wakeup handling continues with no harm done (which is why the bug
    remained undetected until now).  But with these dodgy hubs, the check
    fails because the config descriptor has changed.  This causes the hub
    driver to reinitialize the child device, leading to the
    disconnect/reinitialize loop described in the bug report.
    
    The proper way to note reception of a downstream wakeup request is
    to set a bit in the hub->event_bits variable instead of
    hub->change_bits.  That way the hub driver will realize that something
    has happened to the port but will not think the port and child device
    have been disconnected.  This patch makes that change.

    Bluetooth: bfusb: fix division by zero in send path
    
    commit b5e6fa7a12572c82f1e7f2f51fbb02a322291291 upstream.
    
    Add the missing bulk-out endpoint sanity check to probe() to avoid
    division by zero in bfusb_send_frame() in case a malicious device has
    broken descriptors (or when doing descriptor fuzz testing).
    
    Note that USB core will reject URBs submitted for endpoints with zero
    wMaxPacketSize but that drivers doing packet-size calculations still
    need to handle this (cf. commit 2548288b4fb0 ("USB: Fix: Don't skip
    endpoint descriptors with maxpacket=0")).
