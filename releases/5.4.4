    EDAC/ghes: Do not warn when incrementing refcount on 0
    
    [ Upstream commit 16214bd9e43a31683a7073664b000029bba00354 ]
    
    The following warning from the refcount framework is seen during ghes
    initialization:
    
      EDAC MC0: Giving out device to module ghes_edac.c controller ghes_edac: DEV ghes (INTERRUPT)
      ------------[ cut here ]------------
      refcount_t: increment on 0; use-after-free.
      WARNING: CPU: 36 PID: 1 at lib/refcount.c:156 refcount_inc_checked
     [...]
      Call trace:
       refcount_inc_checked
       ghes_edac_register
       ghes_probe
       ...
    
    It warns if the refcount is incremented from zero. This warning is
    reasonable as a kernel object is typically created with a refcount of
    one and freed once the refcount is zero. Afterwards the object would be
    "used-after-free".
    
    For GHES, the refcount is initialized with zero, and that is why this
    message is seen when initializing the first instance. However, whenever
    the refcount is zero, the device will be allocated and registered. Since
    the ghes_reg_mutex protects the refcount and serializes allocation and
    freeing of ghes devices, a use-after-free cannot happen here.
    
    Instead of using refcount_inc() for the first instance, use
    refcount_set(). This can be used here because the refcount is zero at
    this point and can not change due to its protection by the mutex.

    ext4: fix leak of quota reservations
    
    commit f4c2d372b89a1e504ebb7b7eb3e29b8306479366 upstream.
    
    Commit 8fcc3a580651 ("ext4: rework reserved cluster accounting when
    invalidating pages") moved freeing of delayed allocation reservations
    from dirty page invalidation time to time when we evict corresponding
    status extent from extent status tree. For inodes which don't have any
    blocks allocated this may actually happen only in ext4_clear_blocks()
    which is after we've dropped references to quota structures from the
    inode. Thus reservation of quota leaked. Fix the problem by clearing
    quota information from the inode only after evicting extent status tree
    in ext4_clear_inode().

    splice: only read in as much information as there is pipe buffer space
    
    commit 3253d9d093376d62b4a56e609f15d2ec5085ac73 upstream.
    
    Andreas Grünbacher reports that on the two filesystems that support
    iomap directio, it's possible for splice() to return -EAGAIN (instead of
    a short splice) if the pipe being written to has less space available in
    its pipe buffers than the length supplied by the calling process.
    
    Months ago we fixed splice_direct_to_actor to clamp the length of the
    read request to the size of the splice pipe.  Do the same to do_splice.

    rtc: disable uie before setting time and enable after
    
    commit 7e7c005b4b1f1f169bcc4b2c3a40085ecc663df2 upstream.
    
    When setting the time in the future with the uie timer enabled,
    rtc_timer_do_work will loop for a while because the expiration of the uie
    timer was way before the current RTC time and a new timer will be enqueued
    until the current rtc time is reached.
    
    If the uie timer is enabled, disable it before setting the time and enable
    it after expiring current timers (which may actually be an alarm).
    
    This is the safest thing to do to ensure the uie timer is still
    synchronized with the RTC, especially in the UIE emulation case.

    USB: dummy-hcd: increase max number of devices to 32
    
    commit 8442b02bf3c6770e0d7e7ea17be36c30e95987b6 upstream.
    
    When fuzzing the USB subsystem with syzkaller, we currently use 8 testing
    processes within one VM. To isolate testing processes from one another it
    is desirable to assign a dedicated USB bus to each of those, which means
    we need at least 8 Dummy UDC/HCD devices.
    
    This patch increases the maximum number of Dummy UDC/HCD devices to 32
    (more than 8 in case we need more of them in the future).

    powerpc: Define arch_is_kernel_initmem_freed() for lockdep
    
    commit 6f07048c00fd100ed8cab66c225c157e0b6c0a50 upstream.
    
    Under certain circumstances, we hit a warning in lockdep_register_key:
    
            if (WARN_ON_ONCE(static_obj(key)))
                    return;
    
    This occurs when the key falls into initmem that has since been freed
    and can now be reused. This has been observed on boot, and under
    memory pressure.
    
    Define arch_is_kernel_initmem_freed(), which allows lockdep to
    correctly identify this memory as dynamic.
    
    This fixes a bug picked up by the powerpc64 syzkaller instance where
    we hit the WARN via alloc_netdev_mqs.

    s390/kaslr: store KASLR offset for early dumps
    
    commit a9f2f6865d784477e1c7b59269d3a384abafd9ca upstream.
    
    The KASLR offset is added to vmcoreinfo in arch_crash_save_vmcoreinfo(),
    so that it can be found by crash when processing kernel dumps.
    
    However, arch_crash_save_vmcoreinfo() is called during a subsys_initcall,
    so if the kernel crashes before that, we have no vmcoreinfo and no KASLR
    offset.
    
    Fix this by storing the KASLR offset in the lowcore, where the vmcore_info
    pointer will be stored, and where it can be found by crash. In order to
    make it distinguishable from a real vmcore_info pointer, mark it as uneven
    (KASLR offset itself is aligned to THREAD_SIZE).
    
    When arch_crash_save_vmcoreinfo() stores the real vmcore_info pointer in
    the lowcore, it overwrites the KASLR offset. At that point, the KASLR
    offset is not yet added to vmcoreinfo, so we also need to move the
    mem_assign_absolute() behind the vmcoreinfo_append_str().

    s390/smp,vdso: fix ASCE handling
    
    commit a2308c11ecbc3471ebb7435ee8075815b1502ef0 upstream.
    
    When a secondary CPU is brought up it must initialize its control
    registers. CPU A which triggers that a secondary CPU B is brought up
    stores its control register contents into the lowcore of new CPU B,
    which then loads these values on startup.
    
    This is problematic in various ways: the control register which
    contains the home space ASCE will correctly contain the kernel ASCE;
    however control registers for primary and secondary ASCEs are
    initialized with whatever values were present in CPU A.
    
    Typically:
    - the primary ASCE will contain the user process ASCE of the process
      that triggered onlining of CPU B.
    - the secondary ASCE will contain the percpu VDSO ASCE of CPU A.
    
    Due to lazy ASCE handling we may also end up with other combinations.
    
    When then CPU B switches to a different process (!= idle) it will
    fixup the primary ASCE. However the problem is that the (wrong) ASCE
    from CPU A was loaded into control register 1: as soon as an ASCE is
    attached (aka loaded) a CPU is free to generate TLB entries using that
    address space.
    Even though it is very unlikey that CPU B will actually generate such
    entries, this could result in TLB entries of the address space of the
    process that ran on CPU A. These entries shouldn't exist at all and
    could cause problems later on.
    
    Furthermore the secondary ASCE of CPU B will not be updated correctly.
    This means that processes may see wrong results or even crash if they
    access VDSO data on CPU B. The correct VDSO ASCE will eventually be
    loaded on return to user space as soon as the kernel executed a call
    to strnlen_user or an atomic futex operation on CPU B.
    
    Fix both issues by intializing the to be loaded control register
    contents with the correct ASCEs and also enforce (re-)loading of the
    ASCEs upon first context switch and return to user space.

    ext4: work around deleting a file with i_nlink == 0 safely
    
    commit c7df4a1ecb8579838ec8c56b2bb6a6716e974f37 upstream.
    
    If the file system is corrupted such that a file's i_links_count is
    too small, then it's possible that when unlinking that file, i_nlink
    will already be zero.  Previously we were working around this kind of
    corruption by forcing i_nlink to one; but we were doing this before
    trying to delete the directory entry --- and if the file system is
    corrupted enough that ext4_delete_entry() fails, then we exit with
    i_nlink elevated, and this causes the orphan inode list handling to be
    FUBAR'ed, such that when we unmount the file system, the orphan inode
    list can get corrupted.
    
    A better way to fix this is to simply skip trying to call drop_nlink()
    if i_nlink is already zero, thus moving the check to the place where
    it makes the most sense.

    The problem occurs because kmem_cache_destroy() is called immediately
    after deleting of a memcg, so it races with the memcg kmem_cache
    deactivation.
    
    flush_memcg_workqueue() at the beginning of kmem_cache_destroy() is
    supposed to guarantee that all deactivation processes are finished, but
    failed to do so.  It waits for an rcu grace period, after which all
    children kmem_caches should be deactivated.  During the deactivation
    percpu_ref_kill() is called for non root kmem_cache refcounters, but it
    requires yet another rcu grace period to finish the transition to the
    atomic (dead) state.
    
    So in a rare case when not all children kmem_caches are destroyed at the
    moment when the root kmem_cache is about to be gone, we need to wait
    another rcu grace period before destroying the root kmem_cache.
    
    This issue can be triggered only with dynamically created kmem_caches
    which are used with memcg accounting.  In this case per-memcg child
    kmem_caches are created.  They are deactivated from the cgroup removing
    path.  If the destruction of the root kmem_cache is racing with the
    removal of the cgroup (both are quite complicated multi-stage
    processes), the described issue can occur.  The only known way to
    trigger it in the real life, is to unload some kernel module which
    creates a dedicated kmem_cache, used from different memory cgroups with
    GFP_ACCOUNT flag.  If the unloading happens immediately after calling
    rmdir on the corresponding cgroup, there is some chance to trigger the
    issue.

    commit 37ef8c2c15bdc1322b160e38986c187de2b877b2 upstream.
    
    The Rockchip PMIC driver can automatically detect connected component
    versions by reading the ID_MSB and ID_LSB registers. The probe function
    will always fail with RK818 PMICs because the ID_MSK is 0xFFF0 and the

    This patch changes this value to 0x8180.

    mm, memfd: fix COW issue on MAP_PRIVATE and F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE mappings
    
    commit 05d351102dbe4e103d6bdac18b1122cd3cd04925 upstream.
    
    F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE has unexpected behavior when used with MAP_PRIVATE:
    A private mapping created after the memfd file that gets sealed with
    F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE loses the copy-on-write at fork behavior, meaning
    children and parent share the same memory, even though the mapping is
    private.
    
    The reason for this is due to the code below:
    
      static int shmem_mmap(struct file *file, struct vm_area_struct *vma)
      {
            struct shmem_inode_info *info = SHMEM_I(file_inode(file));
    
            if (info->seals & F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE) {
                    /*
                     * New PROT_WRITE and MAP_SHARED mmaps are not allowed when
                     * "future write" seal active.
                     */
                    if ((vma->vm_flags & VM_SHARED) && (vma->vm_flags & VM_WRITE))
                            return -EPERM;
    
                    /*
                     * Since the F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE seals allow for a MAP_SHARED
                     * read-only mapping, take care to not allow mprotect to revert
                     * protections.
                     */
                    vma->vm_flags &= ~(VM_MAYWRITE);
            }
            ...
      }
    
    And for the mm to know if a mapping is copy-on-write:
    
      static inline bool is_cow_mapping(vm_flags_t flags)
      {
            return (flags & (VM_SHARED | VM_MAYWRITE)) == VM_MAYWRITE;
      }
    
    The patch fixes the issue by making the mprotect revert protection
    happen only for shared mappings.  For private mappings, using mprotect
    will have no effect on the seal behavior.
    
    The F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE feature was introduced in v5.1 so v5.3.x stable
    kernels would need a backport.

    [ Upstream commit 552263456215ada7ee8700ce022d12b0cffe4802 ]
    
    clock_getres in the vDSO library has to preserve the same behaviour
    of posix_get_hrtimer_res().
    
    In particular, posix_get_hrtimer_res() does:
        sec = 0;
        ns = hrtimer_resolution;
    and hrtimer_resolution depends on the enablement of the high
    resolution timers that can happen either at compile or at run time.
    
    Fix the powerpc vdso implementation of clock_getres keeping a copy of
    hrtimer_resolution in vdso data and using that directly.

    omap: pdata-quirks: revert pandora specific gpiod additions
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e8fad98171babe019db51c15055ec74697e9525 ]
    
    This partly reverts the commit efdfeb079cc3 ("regulator: fixed: Convert to
    use GPIO descriptor only").
    
    We must remove this from mainline first, so that the following patch
    to remove the openpandora quirks for mmc3 and wl1251 cleanly applies
    to stable v4.9, v4.14, v4.19 where the above mentioned patch is not yet
    present.
    
    Since the code affected is removed (no pandora gpios in pdata-quirks
    and more), there will be no matching revert-of-the-revert.

    iio: ad7949: fix channels mixups
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b71f6b59508b1c9befcb43de434866aafc76520 ]
    
    Each time we need to read a sample (from the sysfs interface, since the
    driver supports only it) the driver writes the configuration register
    with the proper settings needed to perform the said read, then it runs
    another xfer to actually read the resulting value. Most notably the
    configuration register is updated to set the ADC internal MUX depending by
    which channel the read targets.
    
    Unfortunately this seems not enough to ensure correct operation because
    the ADC works in a pipelined-like fashion and the new configuration isn't
    applied in time.
    
    The ADC alternates two phases: acquisition and conversion. During the
    acquisition phase the ADC samples the analog signal in an internal
    capacitor; in the conversion phase the ADC performs the actual analog to
    digital conversion of the stored voltage. Note that of course the MUX
    needs to be set to the proper channel when the acquisition phase is
    performed.
    
    Once the conversion phase has been completed, the device automatically
    switches back to a new acquisition; on the other hand the device switches
    from acquisition to conversion on the rising edge of SPI cs signal (that
    is when the xfer finishes).
    
    Only after both two phases have been completed (with the proper settings
    already written in the configuration register since the beginning) it is
    possible to read the outcome from SPI bus.
    
    With the current driver implementation, we end up in the following
    situation:
    
            _______  1st xfer ____________  2nd xfer ___________________
    SPI cs..       \_________/            \_________/
    SPI rd.. idle  |(val N-2)+    idle    | val N-1 +   idle ...
    SPI wr.. idle  |  cfg N  +    idle    |   (X)   +   idle ...
    ------------------------ + -------------------- + ------------------
      AD  ..   acq  N-1      + cnv N-1 |  acq N     +  cnv N  | acq N+1
    
    As shown in the diagram above, the value we read in the Nth read belongs
    to configuration setting N-1.
    
    In case the configuration is not changed (config[N] == config[N-1]), then
    we still get correct data, but in case the configuration changes (i.e.
    switching the MUX on another channel), we get wrong data (data from the
    previously selected channel).
    
    This patch fixes this by performing one more "dummy" transfer in order to
    ending up in reading the data when it's really ready, as per the following
    timing diagram.
    
            _______  1st xfer ____________  2nd xfer ___________  3rd xfer ___
    SPI cs..       \_________/            \_________/           \_________/
    SPI rd.. idle  |(val N-2)+    idle    |(val N-1)+    idle   |  val N  + ..
    SPI wr.. idle  |  cfg N  +    idle    |   (X)   +    idle   |   (X)   + ..
    ------------------------ + -------------------- + ------------------- + --
      AD  ..   acq  N-1      + cnv N-1 |  acq N     +  cnv N  | acq N+1   | ..
    
    NOTE: in the latter case (cfg changes), the acquisition phase for the
    value to be read begins after the 1st xfer, that is after the read request
    has been issued on sysfs. On the other hand, if the cfg doesn't change,
    then we can refer to the fist diagram assuming N == (N - 1); the
    acquisition phase _begins_ before the 1st xfer (potentially a lot of time
    before the read has been issued via sysfs, but it _ends_ after the 1st
    xfer, that is _after_ the read has started. This should guarantee a
    reasonably fresh data, which value represents the voltage that the sampled
    signal has after the read start or maybe just around it.

    iio: ad7949: kill pointless "readback"-handling code
    
    [ Upstream commit c270bbf7bb9ddc4e2a51b3c56557c377c9ac79bc ]
    
    The device could be configured to spit out also the configuration word
    while reading the AD result value (in the same SPI xfer) - this is called
    "readback" in the device datasheet.
    
    The driver checks if readback is enabled and it eventually adjusts the SPI
    xfer length and it applies proper shifts to still get the data, discarding
    the configuration word.
    
    The readback option is actually never enabled (the driver disables it), so
    the said checks do not serve for any purpose.
    
    Since enabling the readback option seems not to provide any advantage (the
    driver entirely sets the configuration word without relying on any default
    value), just kill the said, unused, code.

    reiserfs: fix extended attributes on the root directory
    
    commit 60e4cf67a582d64f07713eda5fcc8ccdaf7833e6 upstream.
    
    Since commit d0a5b995a308 (vfs: Add IOP_XATTR inode operations flag)
    extended attributes haven't worked on the root directory in reiserfs.
    
    This is due to reiserfs conditionally setting the sb->s_xattrs handler
    array depending on whether it located or create the internal privroot
    directory.  It necessarily does this after the root inode is already
    read in.  The IOP_XATTR flag is set during inode initialization, so
    it never gets set on the root directory.
    
    This commit unconditionally assigns sb->s_xattrs and clears IOP_XATTR on
    internal inodes.  The old return values due to the conditional assignment
    are handled via open_xa_root, which now returns EOPNOTSUPP as the VFS
    would have done.

        if (dquot_dirty(dquot)) {
              spin_unlock(&dq_list_lock);
              dquot->dq_sb->dq_op->write_dquot(dquot);
              goto we_slept
        if (test_bit(DQ_ACTIVE_B, &dquot->dq_flags)) {
              spin_unlock(&dq_list_lock);
              dquot->dq_sb->dq_op->release_dquot(dquot);
                                                                dqget()

    So dquot dirty quota will be released by TASK1, but on next we_sleept loop
    we detect this and call ->write_dquot() for it.

    powerpc/xive: Skip ioremap() of ESB pages for LSI interrupts
    
    commit b67a95f2abff0c34e5667c15ab8900de73d8d087 upstream.
    
    The PCI INTx interrupts and other LSI interrupts are handled differently
    under a sPAPR platform. When the interrupt source characteristics are
    queried, the hypervisor returns an H_INT_ESB flag to inform the OS
    that it should be using the H_INT_ESB hcall for interrupt management
    and not loads and stores on the interrupt ESB pages.
    
    A default -1 value is returned for the addresses of the ESB pages. The
    driver ignores this condition today and performs a bogus IO mapping.
    Recent changes and the DEBUG_VM configuration option make the bug
    visible with :

    powerpc/xive: Prevent page fault issues in the machine crash handler
    
    commit 1ca3dec2b2dff9d286ce6cd64108bda0e98f9710 upstream.
    
    When the machine crash handler is invoked, all interrupts are masked
    but interrupts which have not been started yet do not have an ESB page
    mapped in the Linux address space. This crashes the 'crash kexec'
    sequence on sPAPR guests.
    
    To fix, force the mapping of the ESB page when an interrupt is being
    mapped in the Linux IRQ number space. This is done by setting the
    initial state of the interrupt to OFF which is not necessarily the
    case on PowerNV.

    coresight: Serialize enabling/disabling a link device.
    
    commit edda32dabedb01f98b9d7b9a4492c13357834bbe upstream.
    
    When tracing etm data of multiple threads on multiple cpus through perf
    interface, some link devices are shared between paths of different cpus.
    It creates race conditions when different cpus wants to enable/disable
    the same link device at the same time.
    
    Example 1:
    Two cpus want to enable different ports of a coresight funnel, thus
    calling the funnel enable operation at the same time. But the funnel
    enable operation isn't reentrantable.
    
    Example 2:
    For an enabled coresight dynamic replicator with refcnt=1, one cpu wants
    to disable it, while another cpu wants to enable it. Ideally we still have
    an enabled replicator with refcnt=1 at the end. But in reality the result
    is uncertain.
    
    Since coresight devices claim themselves when enabled for self-hosted
    usage, the race conditions above usually make the link devices not usable
    after many cycles.
    
    To fix the race conditions, this patch uses spinlocks to serialize
    enabling/disabling link devices.

    stm class: Lose the protocol driver when dropping its reference

    Commit c7fd62bc69d02 ("stm class: Introduce framing protocol drivers")
    forgot to tear down the link between an stm device and its protocol
    driver when policy is removed. This leads to an invalid pointer reference
    if one tries to write to an stm device after the policy has been removed
    and the protocol driver module unloaded, leading to the below splat:

    * On sparc64, the microseconds are in the other half of the

    Fix both, and mark the fix for stable backports.

    ARM: dts: omap3-tao3530: Fix incorrect MMC card detection GPIO polarity
    
    commit 287897f9aaa2ad1c923d9875914f57c4dc9159c8 upstream.
    
    The MMC card detection GPIO polarity is active low on TAO3530, like in many
    other similar boards. Now the card is not detected and it is unable to
    mount rootfs from an SD card.
    
    Fix this by using the correct polarity.
    
    This incorrect polarity was defined already in the commit 30d95c6d7092
    ("ARM: dts: omap3: Add Technexion TAO3530 SOM omap3-tao3530.dtsi") in v3.18
    kernel and later changed to use defined GPIO constants in v4.4 kernel by
    the commit 3a637e008e54 ("ARM: dts: Use defined GPIO constants in flags
    cell for OMAP2+ boards").
    
    While the latter commit did not introduce the issue I'm marking it with
    Fixes tag due the v4.4 kernels still being maintained.

    mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: add code for special init of wl1251 to get rid of pandora_wl1251_init_card
    
    commit f6498b922e57aecbe3b7fa30a308d9d586c0c369 upstream.
    
    Pandora_wl1251_init_card was used to do special pdata based
    setup of the sdio mmc interface. This does no longer work with
    v4.7 and later. A fix requires a device tree based mmc3 setup.
    
    Therefore we move the special setup to omap_hsmmc.c instead
    of calling some pdata supplied init_card function.
    
    The new code checks for a DT child node compatible to wl1251
    so it will not affect other MMC3 use cases.
    
    Generally, this code was and still is a hack and should be
    moved to mmc core to e.g. read such properties from optional
    DT child nodes.

    pinctrl: samsung: Fix device node refcount leaks in S3C24xx wakeup controller init
    
    commit 6fbbcb050802d6ea109f387e961b1dbcc3a80c96 upstream.
    
    In s3c24xx_eint_init() the for_each_child_of_node() loop is used with a
    break to find a matching child node.  Although each iteration of
    for_each_child_of_node puts the previous node, but early exit from loop
    misses it.  This leads to leak of device node.

    pinctrl: samsung: Add of_node_put() before return in error path
    
    commit 3d2557ab75d4c568c79eefa2e550e0d80348a6bd upstream.
    
    Each iteration of for_each_child_of_node puts the previous node, but in
    the case of a return from the middle of the loop, there is no put, thus
    causing a memory leak. Hence add an of_node_put before the return of
    exynos_eint_wkup_init() error path.

    ACPI: PM: Avoid attaching ACPI PM domain to certain devices
    
    commit b9ea0bae260f6aae546db224daa6ac1bd9d94b91 upstream.
    
    Certain ACPI-enumerated devices represented as platform devices in
    Linux, like fans, require special low-level power management handling
    implemented by their drivers that is not in agreement with the ACPI
    PM domain behavior.  That leads to problems with managing ACPI fans
    during system-wide suspend and resume.
    
    For this reason, make acpi_dev_pm_attach() skip the affected devices
    by adding a list of device IDs to avoid to it and putting the IDs of
    the affected devices into that list.

    ACPI: EC: Rework flushing of pending work
    
    commit 016b87ca5c8c6e9e87db442f04dc99609b11ed36 upstream.
    
    There is a race condition in the ACPI EC driver, between
    __acpi_ec_flush_event() and acpi_ec_event_handler(), that may
    cause systems to stay in suspended-to-idle forever after a wakeup
    event coming from the EC.
    
    Namely, acpi_s2idle_wake() calls acpi_ec_flush_work() to wait until
    the delayed work resulting from the handling of the EC GPE in
    acpi_ec_dispatch_gpe() is processed, and that function invokes
    __acpi_ec_flush_event() which uses wait_event() to wait for
    ec->nr_pending_queries to become zero on ec->wait, and that wait
    queue may be woken up too early.
    
    Suppose that acpi_ec_dispatch_gpe() has caused acpi_ec_gpe_handler()
    to run, so advance_transaction() has been called and it has invoked
    acpi_ec_submit_query() to queue up an event work item, so
    ec->nr_pending_queries has been incremented (under ec->lock).  The
    work function of that work item, acpi_ec_event_handler() runs later
    and calls acpi_ec_query() to process the event.  That function calls
    acpi_ec_transaction() which invokes acpi_ec_transaction_unlocked()
    and the latter wakes up ec->wait under ec->lock, but it drops that
    lock before returning.
    
    When acpi_ec_query() returns, acpi_ec_event_handler() acquires
    ec->lock and decrements ec->nr_pending_queries, but at that point
    __acpi_ec_flush_event() (woken up previously) may already have
    acquired ec->lock, checked the value of ec->nr_pending_queries (and
    it would not have been zero then) and decided to go back to sleep.
    Next, if ec->nr_pending_queries is equal to zero now, the loop
    in acpi_ec_event_handler() terminates, ec->lock is released and
    acpi_ec_check_event() is called, but it does nothing unless
    ec_event_clearing is equal to ACPI_EC_EVT_TIMING_EVENT (which is
    not the case by default).  In the end, if no more event work items
    have been queued up while executing acpi_ec_transaction_unlocked(),
    there is nothing to wake up __acpi_ec_flush_event() again and it
    sleeps forever, so the suspend-to-idle loop cannot make progress and
    the system is permanently suspended.
    
    To avoid this issue, notice that it actually is not necessary to
    wait for ec->nr_pending_queries to become zero in every case in
    which __acpi_ec_flush_event() is used.
    
    First, during platform-based system suspend (not suspend-to-idle),
    __acpi_ec_flush_event() is called by acpi_ec_disable_event() after
    clearing the EC_FLAGS_QUERY_ENABLED flag, which prevents
    acpi_ec_submit_query() from submitting any new event work items,
    so calling flush_scheduled_work() and flushing ec_query_wq
    subsequently (in order to wait until all of the queries in that
    queue have been processed) would be sufficient to flush all of
    the pending EC work in that case.
    
    Second, the purpose of the flushing of pending EC work while
    suspended-to-idle described above really is to wait until the
    first event work item coming from acpi_ec_dispatch_gpe() is
    complete, because it should produce system wakeup events if
    that is a valid EC-based system wakeup, so calling
    flush_scheduled_work() followed by flushing ec_query_wq is also
    sufficient for that purpose.
    
    Rework the code to follow the above observations.

    commit 833a426cc471b6088011b3d67f1dc4e147614647 upstream.
    
    acpi_os_map_cleanup checks map->refcount outside of acpi_ioremap_lock
    before freeing the map. This creates a race condition the can result
    in the map being freed more than once.
    A panic can be caused by running

            done &
    done
    
    This patch makes sure that only the process that drops the reference
    to 0 does the freeing.

    ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Allocate resources directly under the non-hotplug bridge
    
    commit 77adf9355304f8dcf09054280af5e23fc451ab3d upstream.
    
    Valerio and others reported that commit 84c8b58ed3ad ("ACPI / hotplug /
    PCI: Don't scan bridges managed by native hotplug") prevents some recent
    LG and HP laptops from booting with endless loop of:
    
      ACPI Error: No handler or method for GPE 08, disabling event (20190215/evgpe-835)
      ACPI Error: No handler or method for GPE 09, disabling event (20190215/evgpe-835)
      ACPI Error: No handler or method for GPE 0A, disabling event (20190215/evgpe-835)
      ...
    
    What seems to happen is that during boot, after the initial PCI enumeration
    when EC is enabled the platform triggers ACPI Notify() to one of the root
    ports. The root port itself looks like this:
    
      pci 0000:00:1b.0: PCI bridge to [bus 02-3a]
      pci 0000:00:1b.0:   bridge window [mem 0xc4000000-0xda0fffff]
      pci 0000:00:1b.0:   bridge window [mem 0x80000000-0xa1ffffff 64bit pref]
    
    The BIOS has configured the root port so that it does not have I/O bridge
    window.
    
    Now when the ACPI Notify() is triggered ACPI hotplug handler calls
    acpiphp_native_scan_bridge() for each non-hotplug bridge (as this system is
    using native PCIe hotplug) and pci_assign_unassigned_bridge_resources() to
    allocate resources.
    
    The device connected to the root port is a PCIe switch (Thunderbolt
    controller) with two hotplug downstream ports. Because of the hotplug ports
    __pci_bus_size_bridges() tries to add "additional I/O" of 256 bytes to each
    (DEFAULT_HOTPLUG_IO_SIZE). This gets further aligned to 4k as that's the
    minimum I/O window size so each hotplug port gets 4k I/O window and the
    same happens for the root port (which is also hotplug port). This means
    3 * 4k = 12k I/O window.
    
    Because of this pci_assign_unassigned_bridge_resources() ends up opening a
    I/O bridge window for the root port at first available I/O address which
    seems to be in range 0x1000 - 0x3fff. Normally this range is used for ACPI
    stuff such as GPE bits (below is part of /proc/ioports):
    
        1800-1803 : ACPI PM1a_EVT_BLK
        1804-1805 : ACPI PM1a_CNT_BLK
        1808-180b : ACPI PM_TMR
        1810-1815 : ACPI CPU throttle
        1850-1850 : ACPI PM2_CNT_BLK
        1854-1857 : pnp 00:05
        1860-187f : ACPI GPE0_BLK
    
    However, when the ACPI Notify() happened this range was not yet reserved
    for ACPI/PNP (that happens later) so PCI gets it. It then starts writing to
    this range and accidentally stomps over GPE bits among other things causing
    the endless stream of messages about missing GPE handler.
    
    This problem does not happen if "pci=hpiosize=0" is passed in the kernel
    command line. The reason is that then the kernel does not try to allocate
    the additional 256 bytes for each hotplug port.
    
    Fix this by allocating resources directly below the non-hotplug bridges
    where a new device may appear as a result of ACPI Notify(). This avoids the
    hotplug bridges and prevents opening the additional I/O window.

    ACPI: LPSS: Add dmi quirk for skipping _DEP check for some device-links
    
    commit 6025e2fae3dde3c3d789d08f8ceacbdd9f90d471 upstream.
    
    The iGPU / GFX0 device's _PS0 method on the ASUS T200TA depends on the
    I2C1 controller (which is connected to the embedded controller). But unlike
    in the T100TA/T100CHI this dependency is not listed in the _DEP of the GFX0
    device.
    
    This results in the dev_WARN_ONCE(..., "Transfer while suspended\n") call
    in i2c-designware-master.c triggering and the AML code not working as it
    should.
    
    This commit fixes this by adding a dmi based quirk mechanism for devices
    which miss a _DEP, and adding a quirk for the LNXVIDEO depending on the
    I2C1 device on the Asus T200TA.

    ACPI: LPSS: Add LNXVIDEO -> BYT I2C7 to lpss_device_links
    
    commit cc18735f208565343a9824adeca5305026598550 upstream.
    
    So far on Bay Trail (BYT) we only have been adding a device_link adding
    the iGPU (LNXVIDEO) device as consumer for the I2C controller for the
    PMIC for I2C5, but the PMIC only uses I2C5 on BYT CR (cost reduced) on
    regular BYT platforms I2C7 is used and we were not adding the device_link
    sometimes causing resume ordering issues.
    
    This commit adds LNXVIDEO -> BYT I2C7 to the lpss_device_links table,
    fixing this.
    
    Fixes: 2d71ee0ce72f ("ACPI / LPSS: Add a device link from the GPU to the BYT I2C5 controller")

    commit a814dcc269830c9dbb8a83731cfc6fc5dd787f8d upstream.
    
    We have a stub defined for the acpi_dev_get_first_match_dev() in acpi.h
    for the case when CONFIG_ACPI=n.
    
    Moreover, acpi_dev_put(), counterpart function, is already placed under

    cpufreq: powernv: fix stack bloat and hard limit on number of CPUs
    
    commit db0d32d84031188443e25edbd50a71a6e7ac5d1d upstream.
    
    The following build warning occurred on powerpc 64-bit builds:
    
    drivers/cpufreq/powernv-cpufreq.c: In function 'init_chip_info':
    drivers/cpufreq/powernv-cpufreq.c:1070:1: warning: the frame size of
    1040 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
    
    This is with a cross-compiler based on gcc 8.1.0, which I got from:
      https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/tools/crosstool/files/bin/x86_64/8.1.0/
    
    The warning is due to putting 1024 bytes on the stack:
    
        unsigned int chip[256];
    
    ...and it's also undesirable to have a hard limit on the number of
    CPUs here.
    
    Fix both problems by dynamically allocating based on num_possible_cpus,
    as recommended by Michael Ellerman.

    powerpc/perf: Disable trace_imc pmu
    
    commit 249fad734a25889a4f23ed014d43634af6798063 upstream.
    
    When a root user or a user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege uses any
    trace_imc performance monitoring unit events, to monitor application
    or KVM threads, it may result in a checkstop (System crash).
    
    The cause is frequent switching of the "trace/accumulation" mode of
    the In-Memory Collection hardware (LDBAR).
    
    This patch disables the trace_imc PMU unit entirely to avoid
    triggering the checkstop. A future patch will reenable it at a later
    stage once a workaround has been developed.

    perf tests: Fix out of bounds memory access
    
    commit af8490eb2b33684e26a0a927a9d93ae43cd08890 upstream.
    
    The test case 'Read backward ring buffer' failed on 32-bit architectures
    which were found by LKFT perf testing.  The test failed on arm32 x15
    device, qemu_arm32, qemu_i386, and found intermittent failure on i386;
    the failure log is as below:
    
      50: Read backward ring buffer                  :
      --- start ---
      test child forked, pid 510
      Using CPUID GenuineIntel-6-9E-9
      mmap size 1052672B
      mmap size 8192B
      Finished reading overwrite ring buffer: rewind
      free(): invalid next size (fast)
      test child interrupted
      ---- end ----
      Read backward ring buffer: FAILED!
    
    The log hints there have issue for memory usage, thus free() reports
    error 'invalid next size' and directly exit for the case.  Finally, this
    issue is root caused as out of bounds memory access for the data array
    'evsel->id'.
    
    The backward ring buffer test invokes do_test() twice.  'evsel->id' is
    allocated at the first call with the flow:
    
      test__backward_ring_buffer()
        `-> do_test()
              `-> evlist__mmap()
                    `-> evlist__mmap_ex()
                          `-> perf_evsel__alloc_id()
    
    So 'evsel->id' is allocated with one item, and it will be used in
    function perf_evlist__id_add():
    
       evsel->id[0] = id
       evsel->ids   = 1
    
    At the second call for do_test(), it skips to initialize 'evsel->id'
    and reuses the array which is allocated in the first call.  But
    'evsel->ids' contains the stale value.  Thus:
    
       evsel->id[1] = id    -> out of bound access
       evsel->ids   = 2
    
    To fix this issue, we will use evlist__open() and evlist__close() pair
    functions to prepare and cleanup context for evlist; so 'evsel->id' and
    'evsel->ids' can be initialized properly when invoke do_test() and avoid
    the out of bounds memory access.

    erofs: zero out when listxattr is called with no xattr
    
    commit 926d1650176448d7684b991fbe1a5b1a8289e97c upstream.
    
    As David reported [1], ENODATA returns when attempting
    to modify files by using EROFS as an overlayfs lower layer.
    
    The root cause is that listxattr could return unexpected
    -ENODATA by mistake for inodes without xattr. That breaks
    listxattr return value convention and it can cause copy
    up failure when used with overlayfs.
    
    Resolve by zeroing out if no xattr is found for listxattr.

    cpuidle: teo: Fix "early hits" handling for disabled idle states
    
    commit 159e48560f51d9c2aa02d762a18cd24f7868ab27 upstream.
    
    The TEO governor uses idle duration "bins" defined in accordance with
    the CPU idle states table provided by the driver, so that each "bin"
    covers the idle duration range between the target residency of the
    idle state corresponding to it and the target residency of the closest
    deeper idle state.  The governor collects statistics for each bin
    regardless of whether or not the idle state corresponding to it is
    currently enabled.
    
    In particular, the "early hits" metric measures the likelihood of a
    situation in which the idle duration measured after wakeup falls into
    to given bin, but the time till the next timer (sleep length) falls
    into a bin corresponding to one of the deeper idle states.  It is
    used when the "hits" and "misses" metrics indicate that the state
    "matching" the sleep length should not be selected, so that the state
    with the maximum "early hits" value is selected instead of it.
    
    If the idle state corresponding to the given bin is disabled, it
    cannot be selected and if it turns out to be the one that should be
    selected, a shallower idle state needs to be used instead of it.
    Nevertheless, the metrics collected for the bin corresponding to it
    are still valid and need to be taken into account as though that
    state had not been disabled.
    
    As far as the "early hits" metric is concerned, teo_select() tries to
    take disabled states into account, but the state index corresponding
    to the maximum "early hits" value computed by it may be incorrect.
    Namely, it always uses the index of the previous maximum "early hits"
    state then, but there may be enabled idle states closer to the
    disabled one in question.  In particular, if the current candidate
    state (whose index is the idx value) is closer to the disabled one
    and the "early hits" value of the disabled state is greater than the
    current maximum, the index of the current candidate state (idx)
    should replace the "maximum early hits state" index.
    
    Modify the code to handle that case correctly.

    cpuidle: teo: Consider hits and misses metrics of disabled states
    
    commit e43dcf20215f0287ea113102617ca04daa76b70e upstream.
    
    The TEO governor uses idle duration "bins" defined in accordance with
    the CPU idle states table provided by the driver, so that each "bin"
    covers the idle duration range between the target residency of the
    idle state corresponding to it and the target residency of the closest
    deeper idle state.  The governor collects statistics for each bin
    regardless of whether or not the idle state corresponding to it is
    currently enabled.
    
    In particular, the "hits" and "misses" metrics measure the likelihood
    of a situation in which both the time till the next timer (sleep
    length) and the idle duration measured after wakeup fall into the
    given bin.  Namely, if the "hits" value is greater than the "misses"
    one, that situation is more likely than the one in which the sleep
    length falls into the given bin, but the idle duration measured after
    wakeup falls into a bin corresponding to one of the shallower idle
    states.
    
    If the idle state corresponding to the given bin is disabled, it
    cannot be selected and if it turns out to be the one that should be
    selected, a shallower idle state needs to be used instead of it.
    Nevertheless, the metrics collected for the bin corresponding to it
    are still valid and need to be taken into account as though that
    state had not been disabled.
    
    For this reason, make teo_select() always use the "hits" and "misses"
    values of the idle duration range that the sleep length falls into
    even if the specific idle state corresponding to it is disabled and
    if the "hits" values is greater than the "misses" one, select the
    closest enabled shallower idle state in that case.

    The setting of the motion vectors usage and the setting of motion
    vectors address are currently done under different conditions.
    
    When decoding pre-recorded videos, this results of leaving the motion

    s390/mm: properly clear _PAGE_NOEXEC bit when it is not supported
    
    commit ab874f22d35a8058d8fdee5f13eb69d8867efeae upstream.
    
    On older HW or under a hypervisor, w/o the instruction-execution-
    protection (IEP) facility, and also w/o EDAT-1, a translation-specification
    exception may be recognized when bit 55 of a pte is one (_PAGE_NOEXEC).
    
    The current code tries to prevent setting _PAGE_NOEXEC in such cases,
    by removing it within set_pte_at(). However, ptep_set_access_flags()
    will modify a pte directly, w/o using set_pte_at(). There is at least
    one scenario where this can result in an active pte with _PAGE_NOEXEC
    set, which would then lead to a panic due to a translation-specification
    exception (write to swapped out page):
    
    do_swap_page
      pte = mk_pte (with _PAGE_NOEXEC bit)
      set_pte_at   (will remove _PAGE_NOEXEC bit in page table, but keep it
                    in local variable pte)
      vmf->orig_pte = pte (pte still contains _PAGE_NOEXEC bit)
      do_wp_page
        wp_page_reuse
          entry = vmf->orig_pte (still with _PAGE_NOEXEC bit)
          ptep_set_access_flags (writes entry with _PAGE_NOEXEC bit)
    
    Fix this by clearing _PAGE_NOEXEC already in mk_pte_phys(), where the
    pgprot value is applied, so that no pte with _PAGE_NOEXEC will ever be
    visible, if it is not supported. The check in set_pte_at() can then also
    be removed.

    wil6210: check len before memcpy() calls
    
    commit 2c840676be8ffc624bf9bb4490d944fd13c02d71 upstream.
    
    memcpy() in wmi_set_ie() and wmi_update_ft_ies() is called with
    src == NULL and len == 0. This is an undefined behavior. Fix it
    by checking "ie_len > 0" before the memcpy() calls.
    
    As suggested by GCC documentation:
    "The pointers passed to memmove (and similar functions in <string.h>)
    must be non-null even when nbytes==0, so GCC can use that information
    to remove the check after the memmove call." [1]

    blk-mq: avoid sysfs buffer overflow with too many CPU cores

    It is reported that sysfs buffer overflow can be triggered if the system
    has too many CPU cores(>841 on 4K PAGE_SIZE) when showing CPUs of
    hctx via /sys/block/$DEV/mq/$N/cpu_list.
    
    Use snprintf to avoid the potential buffer overflow.
    
    This version doesn't change the attribute format, and simply stops
    showing CPU numbers if the buffer is going to overflow.

    commit 775d78319f1ceb32be8eb3b1202ccdc60e9cb7f1 upstream.
    
    If pers->make_request fails in md_flush_request(), the bio is lost. To
    fix this, pass back a bool to indicate if the original make_request call
    should continue to handle the I/O and instead of assuming the flush logic
    will push it to completion.
    
    Convert md_flush_request to return a bool and no longer calls the raid
    driver's make_request function.  If the return is true, then the md flush
    logic has or will complete the bio and the md make_request call is done.
    If false, then the md make_request function needs to keep processing like
    it is a normal bio. Let the original call to md_handle_request handle any
    need to retry sending the bio to the raid driver's make_request function
    should it be needed.
    
    Also mark md_flush_request and the make_request function pointer as
    __must_check to issue warnings should these critical return values be
    ignored.

    commit e7cfd867fd9842f346688f28412eb83dec342900 upstream.
    
    The headphone jack on buddy was broken with the following commit:
    commit 6b5da66322c5 ("ASoC: rt5645: read jd1_1 status for jd
    detection").
    This changes the jd_mode for buddy to 4 so buddy can read from the same
    register that was used in the working version of this driver without
    affecting any other devices that might use this, since no other device uses
    jd_mode = 4. To test this I plugged and uplugged the headphone jack, verifying
    audio works.

    workqueue: Fix pwq ref leak in rescuer_thread()
    
    commit e66b39af00f426b3356b96433d620cb3367ba1ff upstream.
    
    008847f66c3 ("workqueue: allow rescuer thread to do more work.") made
    the rescuer worker requeue the pwq immediately if there may be more
    work items which need rescuing instead of waiting for the next mayday
    timer expiration.  Unfortunately, it doesn't check whether the pwq is
    already on the mayday list and unconditionally gets the ref and moves
    it onto the list.  This doesn't corrupt the list but creates an
    additional reference to the pwq.  It got queued twice but will only be
    removed once.
    
    This leak later can trigger pwq refcnt warning on workqueue
    destruction and prevent freeing of the workqueue.

    workqueue: Fix spurious sanity check failures in destroy_workqueue()
    
    commit def98c84b6cdf2eeea19ec5736e90e316df5206b upstream.
    
    Before actually destrying a workqueue, destroy_workqueue() checks
    whether it's actually idle.  If it isn't, it prints out a bunch of
    warning messages and leaves the workqueue dangling.  It unfortunately
    has a couple issues.
    
    * Mayday list queueing increments pwq's refcnts which gets detected as
      busy and fails the sanity checks.  However, because mayday list
      queueing is asynchronous, this condition can happen without any
      actual work items left in the workqueue.
    
    * Sanity check failure leaves the sysfs interface behind too which can
      lead to init failure of newer instances of the workqueue.
    
    This patch fixes the above two by
    
    * If a workqueue has a rescuer, disable and kill the rescuer before
      sanity checks.  Disabling and killing is guaranteed to flush the
      existing mayday list.
    
    * Remove sysfs interface before sanity checks.

    dm zoned: reduce overhead of backing device checks
    
    commit e7fad909b68aa37470d9f2d2731b5bec355ee5d6 upstream.
    
    Commit 75d66ffb48efb3 added backing device health checks and as a part
    of these checks, check_events() block ops template call is invoked in
    dm-zoned mapping path as well as in reclaim and flush path. Calling
    check_events() with ATA or SCSI backing devices introduces a blocking
    scsi_test_unit_ready() call being made in sd_check_events(). Even though
    the overhead of calling scsi_test_unit_ready() is small for ATA zoned
    devices, it is much larger for SCSI and it affects performance in a very
    negative way.
    
    Fix this performance regression by executing check_events() only in case
    of any I/O errors. The function dmz_bdev_is_dying() is modified to call
    only blk_queue_dying(), while calls to check_events() are made in a new
    helper function, dmz_check_bdev().

    ovl: fix corner case of non-unique st_dev;st_ino
    
    commit 9c6d8f13e9da10a26ad7f0a020ef86e8ef142835 upstream.
    
    On non-samefs overlay without xino, non pure upper inodes should use a
    pseudo_dev assigned to each unique lower fs and pure upper inodes use the
    real upper st_dev.
    
    It is fine for an overlay pure upper inode to use the same st_dev;st_ino
    values as the real upper inode, because the content of those two different
    filesystem objects is always the same.
    
    In this case, however:
     - two filesystems, A and B
     - upper layer is on A
     - lower layer 1 is also on A
     - lower layer 2 is on B
    
    Non pure upper overlay inode, whose origin is in layer 1 will have the same
    st_dev;st_ino values as the real lower inode. This may result with a false
    positive results of 'diff' between the real lower and copied up overlay
    inode.
    
    Fix this by using the upper st_dev;st_ino values in this case.  This breaks
    the property of constant st_dev;st_ino across copy up of this case. This
    breakage will be fixed by a later patch.

    ovl: fix lookup failure on multi lower squashfs
    
    commit 7e63c87fc2dcf3be9d3aab82d4a0ea085880bdca upstream.
    
    In the past, overlayfs required that lower fs have non null uuid in
    order to support nfs export and decode copy up origin file handles.
    
    Commit 9df085f3c9a2 ("ovl: relax requirement for non null uuid of
    lower fs") relaxed this requirement for nfs export support, as long
    as uuid (even if null) is unique among all lower fs.
    
    However, said commit unintentionally also relaxed the non null uuid
    requirement for decoding copy up origin file handles, regardless of
    the unique uuid requirement.
    
    Amend this mistake by disabling decoding of copy up origin file handle
    from lower fs with a conflicting uuid.
    
    We still encode copy up origin file handles from those fs, because
    file handles like those already exist in the wild and because they
    might provide useful information in the future.
    
    There is an unhandled corner case described by Miklos this way:
    - two filesystems, A and B, both have null uuid
    - upper layer is on A
    - lower layer 1 is also on A
    - lower layer 2 is on B
    
    In this case bad_uuid won't be set for B, because the check only
    involves the list of lower fs.  Hence we'll try to decode a layer 2
    origin on layer 1 and fail.
    
    We will deal with this corner case later.

    commit 702600eef73033ddd4eafcefcbb6560f3e3a90f7 upstream.

    As commit 700c1018b86d ("x86/insn: Fix awk regexp warnings") showed, it
    turns out that there are a number of awk strings that do not need to be
    escaped and newer versions of awk now warn about this.
    
    Fix the string up so that no warning is produced.  The exact same kernel
    module gets created before and after this patch, showing that it wasn't
    needed.

    different subvolumes, but we only start the transaction on one of them,
    so the other one is not added to the dirty root list.  This is caught by
    btrfs_cow_block() with a warning because the root has not been updated,
    however if we do not modify this root again we'll end up pointing at an
    invalid root because the root item is never updated.
    
    Fix this by making sure we add the destination root to the trans list,
    the same as we do with normal renames.  This fixes the corruption.

    Btrfs: send, skip backreference walking for extents with many references
    
    commit fd0ddbe2509568b00df364156f47561e9f469f15 upstream.
    
    Backreference walking, which is used by send to figure if it can issue
    clone operations instead of write operations, can be very slow and use
    too much memory when extents have many references. This change simply
    skips backreference walking when an extent has more than 64 references,
    in which case we fallback to a write operation instead of a clone
    operation. This limit is conservative and in practice I observed no
    signicant slowdown with up to 100 references and still low memory usage
    up to that limit.
    
    This is a temporary workaround until there are speedups in the backref
    walking code, and as such it does not attempt to add extra interfaces or
    knobs to tweak the threshold.

    btrfs: Avoid getting stuck during cyclic writebacks
    
    commit f7bddf1e27d18fbc7d3e3056ba449cfbe4e20b0a upstream.
    
    During a cyclic writeback, extent_write_cache_pages() uses done_index
    to update the writeback_index after the current run is over.  However,
    instead of current index + 1, it gets to to the current index itself.
    
    Unfortunately, this, combined with returning on EOF instead of looping
    back, can lead to the following pathlogical behavior.
    
    1. There is a single file which has accumulated enough dirty pages to
       trigger balance_dirty_pages() and the writer appending to the file
       with a series of short writes.
    
    2. balance_dirty_pages kicks in, wakes up background writeback and sleeps.
    
    3. Writeback kicks in and the cursor is on the last page of the dirty
       file.  Writeback is started or skipped if already in progress.  As
       it's EOF, extent_write_cache_pages() returns and the cursor is set
       to done_index which is pointing to the last page.
    
    4. Writeback is done.  Nothing happens till balance_dirty_pages
       finishes, at which point we go back to #1.
    
    This can almost completely stall out writing back of the file and keep
    the system over dirty threshold for a long time which can mess up the
    whole system.  We encountered this issue in production with a package
    handling application which can reliably reproduce the issue when
    running under tight memory limits.
    
    Reading the comment in the error handling section, this seems to be to
    avoid accidentally skipping a page in case the write attempt on the
    page doesn't succeed.  However, this concern seems bogus.
    
    On each page, the code either:
    
    * Skips and moves onto the next page.
    
    * Fails issue and sets done_index to index + 1.
    
    * Successfully issues and continue to the next page if budget allows
      and not EOF.
    
    IOW, as long as it's not EOF and there's budget, the code never
    retries writing back the same page.  Only when a page happens to be
    the last page of a particular run, we end up retrying the page, which
    can't possibly guarantee anything data integrity related.  Besides,
    cyclic writes are only used for non-syncing writebacks meaning that
    there's no data integrity implication to begin with.
    
    Fix it by always setting done_index past the current page being
    processed.
    
    Note that this problem exists in other writepages too.

    Btrfs: fix negative subv_writers counter and data space leak after buffered write
    
    commit a0e248bb502d5165b3314ac3819e888fdcdf7d9f upstream.
    
    When doing a buffered write it's possible to leave the subv_writers
    counter of the root, used for synchronization between buffered nocow
    writers and snapshotting. This happens in an exceptional case like the
    following:
    
    1) We fail to allocate data space for the write, since there's not
       enough available data space nor enough unallocated space for allocating
       a new data block group;
    
    2) Because of that failure, we try to go to NOCOW mode, which succeeds
       and therefore we set the local variable 'only_release_metadata' to true
       and set the root's sub_writers counter to 1 through the call to
       btrfs_start_write_no_snapshotting() made by check_can_nocow();
    
    3) The call to btrfs_copy_from_user() returns zero, which is very unlikely
       to happen but not impossible;
    
    4) No pages are copied because btrfs_copy_from_user() returned zero;
    
    5) We call btrfs_end_write_no_snapshotting() which decrements the root's
       subv_writers counter to 0;
    
    6) We don't set 'only_release_metadata' back to 'false' because we do
       it only if 'copied', the value returned by btrfs_copy_from_user(), is
       greater than zero;
    
    7) On the next iteration of the while loop, which processes the same
       page range, we are now able to allocate data space for the write (we
       got enough data space released in the meanwhile);
    
    8) After this if we fail at btrfs_delalloc_reserve_metadata(), because
       now there isn't enough free metadata space, or in some other place
       further below (prepare_pages(), lock_and_cleanup_extent_if_need(),
       btrfs_dirty_pages()), we break out of the while loop with
       'only_release_metadata' having a value of 'true';
    
    9) Because 'only_release_metadata' is 'true' we end up decrementing the
       root's subv_writers counter to -1 (through a call to
       btrfs_end_write_no_snapshotting()), and we also end up not releasing the
       data space previously reserved through btrfs_check_data_free_space().
       As a consequence the mechanism for synchronizing NOCOW buffered writes
       with snapshotting gets broken.
    
    Fix this by always setting 'only_release_metadata' to false at the start
    of each iteration.

    Btrfs: fix metadata space leak on fixup worker failure to set range as delalloc
    
    commit 536870071dbc4278264f59c9a2f5f447e584d139 upstream.
    
    In the fixup worker, if we fail to mark the range as delalloc in the io
    tree, we must release the previously reserved metadata, as well as update
    the outstanding extents counter for the inode, otherwise we leak metadata
    space.
    
    In pratice we can't return an error from btrfs_set_extent_delalloc(),
    which is just a wrapper around __set_extent_bit(), as for most errors
    __set_extent_bit() does a BUG_ON() (or panics which hits a BUG_ON() as
    well) and returning an -EEXIST error doesn't happen in this case since
    the exclusive bits parameter always has a value of 0 through this code
    path. Nevertheless, just fix the error handling in the fixup worker,
    in case one day __set_extent_bit() can return an error to this code
    path.

    This is because the free side drops the ref without the lock, and then
    takes the lock if our refcount is 0.  So you can have nodes on the tree
    that have a refcount of 0.  Fix this by zero'ing out that element in our
    temporary array so we don't try to kill it again.

    btrfs: use btrfs_block_group_cache_done in update_block_group
    
    commit a60adce85f4bb5c1ef8ffcebadd702cafa2f3696 upstream.
    
    When free'ing extents in a block group we check to see if the block
    group is not cached, and then cache it if we need to.  However we'll
    just carry on as long as we're loading the cache.  This is problematic
    because we are dirtying the block group here.  If we are fast enough we
    could do a transaction commit and clear the free space cache while we're
    still loading the space cache in another thread.  This truncates the
    free space inode, which will keep it from loading the space cache.
    
    Fix this by using the btrfs_block_group_cache_done helper so that we try
    to load the space cache unconditionally here, which will result in the
    caller waiting for the fast caching to complete and keep us from
    truncating the free space inode.

    The page we were trying to drop had a page->private, but had no
    page->mapping and so called drop_buffers, assuming that we had a
    buffer_head on the page, and then panic'ed trying to deref 1, which is
    our page->private for data pages.
    
    This is happening because we're truncating the free space cache while
    we're trying to load the free space cache.  This isn't supposed to
    happen, and I'll fix that in a followup patch.  However we still
    shouldn't allow those sort of mistakes to result in messing with pages
    that do not belong to us.  So add the page->mapping check to verify that
    we still own this page after dropping and re-acquiring the page lock.
    
    This page being unlocked as:
    btrfs_readpage
      extent_read_full_page
        __extent_read_full_page
          __do_readpage
            if (!nr)

                                returns an error

    commit 2d7b78f59e020b07fc6338eefe286f54ee2d6773 upstream.
    
    Clear ep0's DWC3_EP_TRANSFER_STARTED flag if the END_TRANSFER command is
    completed. Otherwise, we can't start control transfer again after
    END_TRANSFER.

    commit d3abda5a98a18e524e17fd4085c9f4bd53e9ef53 upstream.
    
    Normally the END_TRANSFER command completion handler will clear the
    DWC3_EP_TRANSFER_STARTED flag. However, if the command was sent without
    interrupt on completion, then the flag will not be cleared. Make sure to
    clear the flag in this case.

    This patch corrects the condition to kick the transfer without
    giving back the requests when either request has remaining data

    virtio-balloon: fix managed page counts when migrating pages between zones
    
    commit 63341ab03706e11a31e3dd8ccc0fbc9beaf723f0 upstream.
    
    In case we have to migrate a ballon page to a newpage of another zone, the
    managed page count of both zones is wrong. Paired with memory offlining
    (which will adjust the managed page count), we can trigger kernel crashes
    and all kinds of different symptoms.
    
    One way to reproduce:
    1. Start a QEMU guest with 4GB, no NUMA
    2. Hotplug a 1GB DIMM and online the memory to ZONE_NORMAL
    3. Inflate the balloon to 1GB
    4. Unplug the DIMM (be quick, otherwise unmovable data ends up on it)
    5. Observe /proc/zoneinfo
      Node 0, zone   Normal
        pages free     16810

              managed  18446744073709533486
    6. Do anything that requires some memory (e.g., inflate the balloon some
    more). The OOM goes crazy and the system crashes

      [  215.973009] Offlined Pages 32768
      cat /proc/meminfo
      -bash: fork: Cannot allocate memory
      [root@vm ~]# cat /proc/meminfo
      -bash: fork: Cannot allocate memory
    
    Fix it by properly adjusting the managed page count when migrating if
    the zone changed. The managed page count of the zones now looks after
    unplug of the DIMM (and after deflating the balloon) just like before
    inflating the balloon (and plugging+onlining the DIMM).
    
    We'll temporarily modify the totalram page count. If this ever becomes a
    problem, we can fine tune by providing helpers that don't touch
    the totalram pages (e.g., adjust_zone_managed_page_count()).
    
    Please note that fixing up the managed page count is only necessary when
    we adjusted the managed page count when inflating - only if we
    don't have VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_DEFLATE_ON_OOM. With that feature, the
    managed page count is not touched when inflating/deflating.

    virt_wifi: fix use-after-free in virt_wifi_newlink()
    
    commit bc71d8b580ba81b55b6e15b1c0320632515b4bac upstream.
    
    When virt_wifi interface is created, virt_wifi_newlink() is called and
    it calls register_netdevice().
    if register_netdevice() fails, it internally would call
    ->priv_destructor(), which is virt_wifi_net_device_destructor() and
    it frees netdev. but virt_wifi_newlink() still use netdev.
    So, use-after-free would occur in virt_wifi_newlink().
    
    Test commands:
        ip link add dummy0 type dummy
        modprobe bonding
        ip link add bonding_masters link dummy0 type virt_wifi
    
    Splat looks like:

    mtd: rawnand: Change calculating of position page containing BBM
    
    commit a3c4c2339f8948b0f578e938970303a7372e60c0 upstream.
    
    Change calculating of position page containing BBM
    
    If none of BBM flags are set then function nand_bbm_get_next_page
    reports EINVAL. It causes that BBM is not read at all during scanning
    factory bad blocks. The result is that the BBT table is build without
    checking factory BBM at all. For Micron flash memories none of these
    flags are set if page size is different than 2048 bytes.
    
    Address this regression by:
    - adding NAND_BBM_FIRSTPAGE chip flag without any condition. It solves
      issue only for Micron devices.
    - changing the nand_bbm_get_next_page_function. It will return 0
      if no of BBM flag is set and page parameter is 0. After that modification
      way of discovering factory bad blocks will work similar as in kernel
      version 5.1.

    mtd: spear_smi: Fix Write Burst mode
    
    commit 69c7f4618c16b4678f8a4949b6bb5ace259c0033 upstream.
    
    Any write with either dd or flashcp to a device driven by the
    spear_smi.c driver will pass through the spear_smi_cpy_toio()
    function. This function will get called for chunks of up to 256 bytes.
    If the amount of data is smaller, we may have a problem if the data
    length is not 4-byte aligned. In this situation, the kernel panics
    during the memcpy:
    
        # dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1001 count=1 of=/dev/mtd6
        spear_smi_cpy_toio [620] dest c9070000, src c7be8800, len 256
        spear_smi_cpy_toio [620] dest c9070100, src c7be8900, len 256
        spear_smi_cpy_toio [620] dest c9070200, src c7be8a00, len 256
        spear_smi_cpy_toio [620] dest c9070300, src c7be8b00, len 233
        Unhandled fault: external abort on non-linefetch (0x808) at 0xc90703e8
        [...]
        PC is at memcpy+0xcc/0x330
    
    The above error occurs because the implementation of memcpy_toio()
    tries to optimize the number of I/O by writing 4 bytes at a time as
    much as possible, until there are less than 4 bytes left and then
    switches to word or byte writes.
    
    Unfortunately, the specification states about the Write Burst mode:
    
            "the next AHB Write request should point to the next
            incremented address and should have the same size (byte,
            half-word or word)"
    
    This means ARM architecture implementation of memcpy_toio() cannot
    reliably be used blindly here. Workaround this situation by update the
    write path to stick to byte access when the burst length is not
    multiple of 4.

    brcmfmac: disable PCIe interrupts before bus reset
    
    commit 5d26a6a6150c486f51ea2aaab33af04db02f63b8 upstream.
    
    Keeping interrupts on could result in brcmfmac freeing some resources
    and then IRQ handlers trying to use them. That was obviously a straight
    path for crashing a kernel.
    
    Example:
    CPU0                           CPU1

    EDAC/altera: Use fast register IO for S10 IRQs
    
    commit 56d9e7bd3fa0f105b6670021d167744bc50ae4fe upstream.
    
    When an IRQ occurs, regmap_{read,write,...}() is invoked in atomic
    context. Regmap must indicate register IO is fast so that a spinlock is
    used instead of a mutex to avoid sleeping in atomic context:
    
      lock_acquire
      __mutex_lock
      mutex_lock_nested
      regmap_lock_mutex
      regmap_write
      a10_eccmgr_irq_unmask
      unmask_irq.part.0
      irq_enable
      __irq_startup
      irq_startup
      __setup_irq
      request_threaded_irq
      devm_request_threaded_irq
      altr_sdram_probe
    
    Mark it so.

    tpm: Switch to platform_get_irq_optional()
    
    commit 9c8c5742b6af76a3fd93b4e56d1d981173cf9016 upstream.
    
    platform_get_irq() calls dev_err() on an error. As the IRQ usage in the
    tpm_tis driver is optional, this is undesirable.
    
    Specifically this leads to this new false-positive error being logged:
    [    5.135413] tpm_tis MSFT0101:00: IRQ index 0 not found
    
    This commit switches to platform_get_irq_optional(), which does not log
    an error, fixing this.

    usb: mon: Fix a deadlock in usbmon between mmap and read
    
    commit 19e6317d24c25ee737c65d1ffb7483bdda4bb54a upstream.
    
    The problem arises because our read() function grabs a lock of the
    circular buffer, finds something of interest, then invokes copy_to_user()
    straight from the buffer, which in turn takes mm->mmap_sem. In the same
    time, the callback mon_bin_vma_fault() is invoked under mm->mmap_sem.
    It attempts to take the fetch lock and deadlocks.
    
    This patch does away with protecting of our page list with any
    semaphores, and instead relies on the kernel not close the device
    while mmap is active in a process.
    
    In addition, we prohibit re-sizing of a buffer while mmap is active.
    This way, when (now unlocked) fault is processed, it works with the
    page that is intended to be mapped-in, and not some other random page.
    Note that this may have an ABI impact, but hopefully no legitimate
    program is this wrong.

    and slave devices can run at different ODRs we must select an accel_odr >=
    slave_odr. Report real accel ODR in st_lsm6dsx_check_odr() in order to
    properly set sensor frequency in st_lsm6dsx_write_raw and avoid to
    report unsupported frequency

    commit 4c35b7a51e2f291471f7221d112c6a45c63e83bc upstream.
    
    The driver is defining debugfs entries by calling
    `adis16480_debugfs_init()`. However, those entries are attached to the
    iio_dev debugfs entry which won't exist if no debugfs_reg_access

    xhci: make sure interrupts are restored to correct state
    
    commit bd82873f23c9a6ad834348f8b83f3b6a5bca2c65 upstream.
    
    spin_unlock_irqrestore() might be called with stale flags after
    reading port status, possibly restoring interrupts to a incorrect
    state.
    
    If a usb2 port just finished resuming while the port status is read
    the spin lock will be temporary released and re-acquired in a separate
    function. The flags parameter is passed as value instead of a pointer,
    not updating flags properly before the final spin_unlock_irqrestore()
    is called.

    xhci: handle some XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirks cases as default behaviour.
    
    commit 7ff11162808cc2ec66353fc012c58bb449c892c3 upstream.
    
    xhci driver claims it needs XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk for both
    Broadcom/Cavium and a Renesas xHC controllers.
    
    The quirk was inteded for handling false "success" complete event for
    transfers that had data left untransferred.
    These transfers should complete with "short packet" events instead.
    
    In these two new cases the false "success" completion is reported
    after a "short packet" if the TD consists of several TRBs.
    xHCI specs 4.10.1.1.2 say remaining TRBs should report "short packet"
    as well after the first short packet in a TD, but this issue seems so
    common it doesn't make sense to add the quirk for all vendors.
    
    Turn these events into short packets automatically instead.
    
    This gets rid of the  "The WARN Successful completion on short TX for
    slot 1 ep 1: needs XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk" warning in many cases.

    xhci: Increase STS_HALT timeout in xhci_suspend()
    
    commit 7c67cf6658cec70d8a43229f2ce74ca1443dc95e upstream.
    
    I've recently observed failed xHCI suspend attempt on AMD Raven Ridge

    Similar to commit ac343366846a ("xhci: Increase STS_SAVE timeout in

    able to suspend again.

    xhci: fix USB3 device initiated resume race with roothub autosuspend
    
    commit 057d476fff778f1d3b9f861fdb5437ea1a3cfc99 upstream.
    
    A race in xhci USB3 remote wake handling may force device back to suspend
    after it initiated resume siganaling, causing a missed resume event or warm
    reset of device.
    
    When a USB3 link completes resume signaling and goes to enabled (UO)
    state a interrupt is issued and the interrupt handler will clear the
    bus_state->port_remote_wakeup resume flag, allowing bus suspend.
    
    If the USB3 roothub thread just finished reading port status before
    the interrupt, finding ports still in suspended (U3) state, but hasn't
    yet started suspending the hub, then the xhci interrupt handler will clear
    the flag that prevented roothub suspend and allow bus to suspend, forcing
    all port links back to suspended (U3) state.
    
    Example case:
    usb_runtime_suspend() # because all ports still show suspended U3
      usb_suspend_both()
        hub_suspend();   # successful as hub->wakeup_bits not set yet
    ==> INTERRUPT
    xhci_irq()
      handle_port_status()
        clear bus_state->port_remote_wakeup
        usb_wakeup_notification()
          sets hub->wakeup_bits;
            kick_hub_wq()
    <== END INTERRUPT
          hcd_bus_suspend()
            xhci_bus_suspend() # success as port_remote_wakeup bits cleared
    
    Fix this by increasing roothub usage count during port resume to prevent
    roothub autosuspend, and by making sure bus_state->port_remote_wakeup
    flag is only cleared after resume completion is visible, i.e.
    after xhci roothub returned U0 or other non-U3 link state link on a
    get port status request.

    which could lead to an illegal free on late probe errors.
    
    Fix this by making sure to clear all driver data at allocation.

    Fix a general protection fault when accessing the endpoint descriptors
    which could be triggered by a malicious device due to missing sanity
    checks on the number of endpoints.

    As Mathias pointed out, the hub enters Cold Attach Status state and
    requires a warm reset. However usb_reset_device() bails out early when
    the device is in suspended state, as its callers port_event() and
    hub_event() don't always resume the device.
    
    Since there's nothing wrong to reset a suspended device, allow
    usb_reset_device() to do so to solve the issue.

    media: venus: remove invalid compat_ioctl32 handler
    
    commit 4adc0423de92cf850d1ef5c0e7cb28fd7a38219e upstream.
    
    v4l2_compat_ioctl32() is the function that calls into
    v4l2_file_operations->compat_ioctl32(), so setting that back to the same
    function leads to a trivial endless loop, followed by a kernel
    stack overrun.
    
    Remove the incorrect assignment.

    ceph: fix compat_ioctl for ceph_dir_operations
    
    commit 18bd6caaef4021803dd0d031dc37c2d001d18a5b upstream.
    
    The ceph_ioctl function is used both for files and directories, but only
    the files support doing that in 32-bit compat mode.
    
    On the s390 architecture, there is also a problem with invalid 31-bit
    pointers that need to be passed through compat_ptr().
    
    Use the new compat_ptr_ioctl() to address both issues.
    
    Note: When backporting this patch to stable kernels, "compat_ioctl:
    add compat_ptr_ioctl()" is needed as well.

    compat_ioctl: add compat_ptr_ioctl()
    
    commit 2952db0fd51b0890f728df94ac563c21407f4f43 upstream.
    
    Many drivers have ioctl() handlers that are completely compatible between
    32-bit and 64-bit architectures, except for the argument that is passed
    down from user space and may have to be passed through compat_ptr()
    in order to become a valid 64-bit pointer.
    
    Using ".compat_ptr = compat_ptr_ioctl" in file operations should let
    us simplify a lot of those drivers to avoid #ifdef checks, and convert
    additional drivers that don't have proper compat handling yet.
    
    On most architectures, the compat_ptr_ioctl() just passes all arguments
    to the corresponding ->ioctl handler. The exception is arch/s390, where
    compat_ptr() clears the top bit of a 32-bit pointer value, so user space
    pointers to the second 2GB alias the first 2GB, as is the case for native
    32-bit s390 user space.
    
    The compat_ptr_ioctl() function must therefore be used only with
    ioctl functions that either ignore the argument or pass a pointer to a
    compatible data type.
    
    If any ioctl command handled by fops->unlocked_ioctl passes a plain
    integer instead of a pointer, or any of the passed data types is
    incompatible between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, a proper handler
    is required instead of compat_ptr_ioctl.

    scsi: qla2xxx: Fix memory leak when sending I/O fails
    
    commit 2f856d4e8c23f5ad5221f8da4a2f22d090627f19 upstream.
    
    On heavy loads, a memory leak of the srb_t structure is observed.  This
    would make the qla2xxx_srbs cache gobble up memory.

    scsi: qla2xxx: Fix double scsi_done for abort path
    
    commit f45bca8c5052e8c59bab64ee90c44441678b9a52 upstream.
    
    Current code assumes abort will remove the original command from the active
    list where scsi_done will not be called. Instead, the eh_abort thread will
    do the scsi_done. That is not the case.  Instead, we have a double
    scsi_done calls triggering use after free.
    
    Abort will tell FW to release the command from FW possesion. The original
    command will return to ULP with error in its normal fashion via scsi_done.
    eh_abort path would wait for the original command completion before
    returning.  eh_abort path will not perform the scsi_done call.

    scsi: lpfc: Fix bad ndlp ptr in xri aborted handling
    
    commit 324e1c402069e8d277d2a2b18ce40bde1265b96a upstream.
    
    In cases where I/O may be aborted, such as driver unload or link bounces,
    the system will crash based on a bad ndlp pointer.
    
    Example:
      RIP: 0010:lpfc_sli4_abts_err_handler+0x15/0x140 [lpfc]
      ...
      lpfc_sli4_io_xri_aborted+0x20d/0x270 [lpfc]
      lpfc_sli4_sp_handle_abort_xri_wcqe.isra.54+0x84/0x170 [lpfc]
      lpfc_sli4_fp_handle_cqe+0xc2/0x480 [lpfc]
      __lpfc_sli4_process_cq+0xc6/0x230 [lpfc]
      __lpfc_sli4_hba_process_cq+0x29/0xc0 [lpfc]
      process_one_work+0x14c/0x390
    
    Crash was caused by a bad ndlp address passed to I/O indicated by the XRI
    aborted CQE.  The address was not NULL so the routine deferenced the ndlp
    ptr. The bad ndlp also caused the lpfc_sli4_io_xri_aborted to call an
    erroneous io handler.  Root cause for the bad ndlp was an lpfc_ncmd that
    was aborted, put on the abort_io list, completed, taken off the abort_io
    list, sent to lpfc_release_nvme_buf where it was put back on the abort_io
    list because the lpfc_ncmd->flags setting LPFC_SBUF_XBUSY was not cleared
    on the final completion.
    
    Rework the exchange busy handling to ensure the flags are properly set for
    both scsi and nvme.

    nvme: Namepace identification descriptor list is optional
    
    commit 22802bf742c25b1e2473c70b3b99da98af65ef4d upstream.
    
    Despite NVM Express specification 1.3 requires a controller claiming to
    be 1.3 or higher implement Identify CNS 03h (Namespace Identification
    Descriptor list), the driver doesn't really need this identification in
    order to use a namespace. The code had already documented in comments
    that we're not to consider an error to this command.
    
    Return success if the controller provided any response to an
    namespace identification descriptors command.
