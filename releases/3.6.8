    ext4: fix metadata checksum calculation for the superblock
    
    commit 06db49e68ae70cf16819b85a14057acb2820776a upstream.
    
    The function ext4_handle_dirty_super() was calculating the superblock
    on the wrong block data.  As a result, when the superblock is modified
    while it is mounted (most commonly, when inodes are added or removed
    from the orphan list), the superblock checksum would be wrong.  We
    didn't notice because the superblock *was* being correctly calculated
    in ext4_commit_super(), and this would get called when the file system
    was unmounted.  So the problem only became obvious if the system
    crashed while the file system was mounted.
    
    Fix this by removing the poorly designed function signature for
    ext4_superblock_csum_set(); if it only took a single argument, the
    pointer to a struct superblock, the ambiguity which caused this
    mistake would have been impossible.

    commit a4f743851f74fc3e0cc40c13082e65c24139f481 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 957ee7270d632245b43f6feb0e70d9a5e9ea6cf6
    (serial: omap: fix software flow control).
    
    As Russell has pointed out, that commit isn't fixing
    Software Flow Control at all, and it actually makes
    it even more broken.
    
    It was agreed to revert this commit and use Russell's
    latest UART patches instead.

    s390/signal: set correct address space control
    
    commit fa968ee215c0ca91e4a9c3a69ac2405aae6e5d2f upstream.
    
    If user space is running in primary mode it can switch to secondary
    or access register mode, this is used e.g. in the clock_gettime code
    of the vdso. If a signal is delivered to the user space process while
    it has been running in access register mode the signal handler is
    executed in access register mode as well which will result in a crash
    most of the time.
    
    Set the address space control bits in the PSW to the default for the
    execution of the signal handler and make sure that the previous
    address space control is restored on signal return. Take care
    that user space can not switch to the kernel address space by
    modifying the registers in the signal frame.

    netfilter: nf_conntrack: fix rt_gateway checks for H.323 helper
    
    commit bbb5823cf742a7e955f35c7d891e4e936944c33a upstream.
    
    After the change "Adjust semantics of rt->rt_gateway"
    (commit f8126f1d51) we should properly match the nexthop when
    destinations are directly connected because rt_gateway can be 0.
    
    The rt_gateway checks in H.323 helper try to avoid the creation
    of an unnecessary expectation in this call-forwarding case:
    
    http://people.netfilter.org/zhaojingmin/h323_conntrack_nat_helper/#_Toc133598073
    
    However, the existing code fails to avoid that in many cases,
    see this thread:
    
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=135043175028620&w=2
    
    It seems it is not trivial to know from the kernel if two hosts
    have to go through the firewall to communicate each other, which
    is the main point of the call-forwarding filter code to avoid
    creating unnecessary expectations.
    
    So this patch just gets things the way they were as before

    commit 2ad5b9e4bd314fc685086b99e90e5de3bc59e26b upstream.
    
    Torsten Luettgert bisected TEE regression starting with commit
    f8126f1d5136be1 (ipv4: Adjust semantics of rt->rt_gateway.)
    
    The problem is that it tries to ARP-lookup the original destination
    address of the forwarded packet, not the address of the gateway.
    
    Fix this using FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH Julian added in commit
    c92b96553a80c1 (ipv4: Add FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH), so that known
    nexthop (info->gw.ip) has preference on resolving.

    tg3: unconditionally select HWMON support when tg3 is enabled.
    
    commit de0a41484c47d783dd4d442914815076aa2caac2 upstream.
    
    There is the seldom used corner case where HWMON=m at the same
    time as TIGON3=y (typically randconfigs) which will cause a link
    fail like:
    
    drivers/built-in.o: In function `tg3_close':
    tg3.c:(.text+0x16bd86): undefined reference to `hwmon_device_unregister'
    drivers/built-in.o: In function `tg3_hwmon_open':
    tg3.c:(.text+0x16fc4b): undefined reference to `hwmon_device_register'
    make[1]: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
    
    Fix it as suggested by DaveM[1] by having the Kconfig logic simply
    select HWMON when TIGON3 is selected.  This gets rid of all the
    extra IS_ENABLED ifdeffery in tg3.c as a side benefit.

    SCSI: isci: Allow SSP tasks into the task management path.
    
    commit 54b46677757ff8d6c282305fc7710f466b63d6dc upstream.
    
    This commit fixes a driver bug for SSP tasks that require task management
    in the target after they complete in the SCU hardware.  The problem was
    manifested in the function "isci_task_abort_task", which tests
    to see if the sas_task.lldd_task is non-NULL before allowing task
    management; this bug would always NULL lldd_task in the SCU I/O completion
    path even if target management was required, which would prevent
    task / target manangement from happening.
    
    Note that in the case of SATA/STP targets, error recovery is provided by
    the libata error handler which is why SATA/STP device recovery worked
    correctly even though SSP handling did not.

    r8169: use unlimited DMA burst for TX
    
    commit aee77e4accbeb2c86b1d294cd84fec4a12dde3bd upstream.
    
    The r8169 driver currently limits the DMA burst for TX to 1024 bytes. I have
    a box where this prevents the interface from using the gigabit line to its full
    potential. This patch solves the problem by setting TX_DMA_BURST to unlimited.
    
    The box has an ASRock B75M motherboard with on-board RTL8168evl/8111evl
    (XID 0c900880). TSO is enabled.
    
    I used netperf (TCP_STREAM test) to measure the dependency of TX throughput
    on MTU. I did it for three different values of TX_DMA_BURST ('5'=512, '6'=1024,
    '7'=unlimited). This chart shows the results:
    http://michich.fedorapeople.org/r8169/r8169-effects-of-TX_DMA_BURST.png
    
    Interesting points:
     - With the current DMA burst limit (1024):
       - at the default MTU=1500 I get only 842 Mbit/s.
       - when going from small MTU, the performance rises monotonically with
         increasing MTU only up to a peak at MTU=1076 (908 MBit/s). Then there's
         a sudden drop to 762 MBit/s from which the throughput rises monotonically
         again with further MTU increases.
     - With a smaller DMA burst limit (512):
       - there's a similar peak at MTU=1076 and another one at MTU=564.
     - With unlimited DMA burst:
       - at the default MTU=1500 I get nice 940 Mbit/s.
       - the throughput rises monotonically with increasing MTU with no strange
         peaks.
    
    Notice that the peaks occur at MTU sizes that are multiples of the DMA burst
    limit plus 52. Why 52? Because:
      20 (IP header) + 20 (TCP header) + 12 (TCP options) = 52
    
    The Realtek-provided r8168 driver (v8.032.00) uses unlimited TX DMA burst too,
    except for CFG_METHOD_1 where the TX DMA burst is set to 512 bytes.
    CFG_METHOD_1 appears to be the oldest MAC version of "RTL8168B/8111B",
    i.e. RTL_GIGA_MAC_VER_11 in r8169. Not sure if this MAC version really needs
    the smaller burst limit, or if any other versions have similar requirements.

    GFS2: Don't call file_accessed() with a shared glock
    
    commit 3d1626889a64bd5a661544d582036a0a02104a60 upstream.
    
    file_accessed() was being called by gfs2_mmap() with a shared glock. If it
    needed to update the atime, it was crashing because it dirtied the inode in
    gfs2_dirty_inode() without holding an exclusive lock. gfs2_dirty_inode()
    checked if the caller was already holding a glock, but it didn't make sure that
    the glock was in the exclusive state. Now, instead of calling file_accessed()
    while holding the shared lock in gfs2_mmap(), file_accessed() is called after
    grabbing and releasing the glock to update the inode.  If file_accessed() needs
    to update the atime, it will grab an exclusive lock in gfs2_dirty_inode().
    
    gfs2_dirty_inode() now also checks to make sure that if the calling process has
    already locked the glock, it has an exclusive lock.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix crash at re-preparing the PCM stream
    
    commit f58161ba1b05a968e5136824b5a16b714b6a5317 upstream.
    
    There are bug reports of a crash with USB-audio devices when PCM
    prepare is performed immediately after the stream is stopped via
    trigger callback.  It turned out that the problem is that we don't
    wait until all URBs are killed.
    
    This patch adds a new function to synchronize the pending stop
    operation on an endpoint, and calls in the prepare callback for
    avoiding the crash above.

    tmpfs: change final i_blocks BUG to WARNING
    
    commit 0f3c42f522dc1ad7e27affc0a4aa8c790bce0a66 upstream.
    
    Under a particular load on one machine, I have hit shmem_evict_inode()'s
    BUG_ON(inode->i_blocks), enough times to narrow it down to a particular
    race between swapout and eviction.
    
    It comes from the "if (freed > 0)" asymmetry in shmem_recalc_inode(),
    and the lack of coherent locking between mapping's nrpages and shmem's
    swapped count.  There's a window in shmem_writepage(), between lowering
    nrpages in shmem_delete_from_page_cache() and then raising swapped
    count, when the freed count appears to be +1 when it should be 0, and
    then the asymmetry stops it from being corrected with -1 before hitting
    the BUG.
    
    One answer is coherent locking: using tree_lock throughout, without
    info->lock; reasonable, but the raw_spin_lock in percpu_counter_add() on
    used_blocks makes that messier than expected.  Another answer may be a
    further effort to eliminate the weird shmem_recalc_inode() altogether,
    but previous attempts at that failed.
    
    So far undecided, but for now change the BUG_ON to WARN_ON: in usual
    circumstances it remains a useful consistency check.

    tcp: fix retransmission in repair mode
    
    [ Upstream commit ec34232575083fd0f43d3a101e8ebb041b203761 ]
    
    Currently if a socket was repaired with a few packet in a write queue,
    a kernel bug may be triggered:
    
    kernel BUG at net/ipv4/tcp_output.c:2330!
    RIP: 0010:[<ffffffff8155784f>] tcp_retransmit_skb+0x5ff/0x610
    
    According to the initial realization v3.4-rc2-963-gc0e88ff,
    all skb-s should look like already posted. This patch fixes code
    according with this sentence.
    
    Here are three points, which were not done in the initial patch:
    1. A tcp send head should not be changed
    2. Initialize TSO state of a skb
    3. Reset the retransmission time
    
    This patch moves logic from tcp_sendmsg to tcp_write_xmit. A packet
    passes the ussual way, but isn't sent to network. This patch solves
    all described problems and handles tcp_sendpages.

    [ Upstream commit b2942004fb5c9f3304b77e187b8a1977b3626c9b ]
    
    With the latest kernel there are two things that must be done post decryption
     so that the packet are forwarded.
     1. Remove the mark from the packet. This will cause the packet to not match
     the ipsec-policy again. However doing this causes the post-decryption check to
     fail also and the packet will get dropped. (cat /proc/net/xfrm_stat).
     2. Remove the sp association in the skbuff so that no policy check is done on
     the packet for VTI tunnels.
    
    Due to #2 above we must now do a security-policy check in the vti rcv path
    prior to resetting the mark in the skbuff.

    Bluetooth: Fix having bogus entries in mgmt_read_index_list reply
    
    commit 476e44cb19f1fbf2d5883dddcc0ce31b33b45915 upstream.
    
    The mgmt_read_index_list uses one loop to calculate the max needed size
    of its response with the help of an upper-bound of the controller count.
    The second loop is more strict as it checks for HCI_SETUP (which might
    have gotten set after the first loop) and could result in some indexes
    being skipped. Because of this the function needs to readjust the event
    length and index count after filling in the response array.

    commit bea8c150a7efbc0f204e709b7274fe273f55e0d3 upstream.
    
    When MEMCG is configured on (even when it's disabled by boot option),
    when adding or removing a page to/from its lru list, the zone pointer
    used for stats updates is nowadays taken from the struct lruvec.  (On
    many configurations, calculating zone from page is slower.)
    
    But we have no code to update all the lruvecs (per zone, per memcg) when
    a memory node is hotadded.  Here's an extract from the oops which
    results when running numactl to bind a program to a newly onlined node:
    
      BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000f60
      IP:  __mod_zone_page_state+0x9/0x60
      Pid: 1219, comm: numactl Not tainted 3.6.0-rc5+ #180 Bochs Bochs
      Process numactl (pid: 1219, threadinfo ffff880039abc000, task ffff8800383c4ce0)
      Call Trace:
        __pagevec_lru_add_fn+0xdf/0x140
        pagevec_lru_move_fn+0xb1/0x100
        __pagevec_lru_add+0x1c/0x30
        lru_add_drain_cpu+0xa3/0x130
        lru_add_drain+0x2f/0x40
       ...
    
    The natural solution might be to use a memcg callback whenever memory is
    hotadded; but that solution has not been scoped out, and it happens that
    we do have an easy location at which to update lruvec->zone.  The lruvec
    pointer is discovered either by mem_cgroup_zone_lruvec() or by
    mem_cgroup_page_lruvec(), and both of those do know the right zone.
    
    So check and set lruvec->zone in those; and remove the inadequate
    attempt to set lruvec->zone from lruvec_init(), which is called before
    NODE_DATA(node) has been allocated in such cases.
    
    Ah, there was one exceptionr.  For no particularly good reason,
    mem_cgroup_force_empty_list() has its own code for deciding lruvec.
    Change it to use the standard mem_cgroup_zone_lruvec() and
    mem_cgroup_get_lru_size() too.  In fact it was already safe against such
    an oops (the lru lists in danger could only be empty), but we're better
    proofed against future changes this way.
    
    I've marked this for stable (3.6) since we introduced the problem in 3.5
    (now closed to stable); but I have no idea if this is the only fix
    needed to get memory hotadd working with memcg in 3.6, and received no
    answer when I enquired twice before.

    memcg: oom: fix totalpages calculation for memory.swappiness==0
    
    commit 9a5a8f19b43430752067ecaee62fc59e11e88fa6 upstream.
    
    oom_badness() takes a totalpages argument which says how many pages are
    available and it uses it as a base for the score calculation.  The value
    is calculated by mem_cgroup_get_limit which considers both limit and
    total_swap_pages (resp.  memsw portion of it).
    
    This is usually correct but since fe35004fbf9e ("mm: avoid swapping out
    with swappiness==0") we do not swap when swappiness is 0 which means
    that we cannot really use up all the totalpages pages.  This in turn
    confuses oom score calculation if the memcg limit is much smaller than
    the available swap because the used memory (capped by the limit) is
    negligible comparing to totalpages so the resulting score is too small
    if adj!=0 (typically task with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or non zero oom_score_adj).
    A wrong process might be selected as result.
    
    The problem can be worked around by checking mem_cgroup_swappiness==0
    and not considering swap at all in such a case.

    KVM: x86: Fix invalid secondary exec controls in vmx_cpuid_update()

    Thanks to Johannes for pointing to truncation: free_swap_and_cache()
    only does a trylock on the page, so the page lock we've held since
    before confirming swap is not enough to protect against truncation.
    
    What cleanup is needed in this case? Just delete_from_swap_cache(),
    which takes care of the memcg uncharge.

    When walking page tables we need to make sure that everything

    pstore: Fix NULL pointer dereference in console writes
    
    commit 70a6f46d7b0ec03653b9ab3f8063a9717a4a53ef upstream.
    
    Passing a NULL id causes a NULL pointer deference in writers such as
    erst_writer and efi_pstore_write because they expect to update this id.
    Pass a dummy id instead.
    
    This avoids a cascade of oopses caused when the initial
    pstore_console_write passes a null which in turn causes writes to the
    console causing further oopses in subsequent pstore_console_write calls.

    UBIFS: fix mounting problems after power cuts
    
    commit a28ad42a4a0c6f302f488f26488b8b37c9b30024 upstream.
    
    This is a bugfix for a problem with the following symptoms:
    
    1. A power cut happens
    2. After reboot, we try to mount UBIFS
    3. Mount fails with "No space left on device" error message
    
    UBIFS complains like this:
    
    UBIFS error (pid 28225): grab_empty_leb: could not find an empty LEB
    
    The root cause of this problem is that when we mount, not all LEBs are
    categorized. Only those which were read are. However, the
    'ubifs_find_free_leb_for_idx()' function assumes that all LEBs were
    categorized and 'c->freeable_cnt' is valid, which is a false assumption.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by teaching 'ubifs_find_free_leb_for_idx()'
    to always fall back to LPT scanning if no freeable LEBs were found.
    
    This problem was reported by few people in the past, but Brent Taylor
    was able to reproduce it and send me a flash image which cannot be mounted,
    which made it easy to hunt the bug. Kudos to Brent.

    commit 5b3761954dac2d1393beef8210eb8cee81d16b8d upstream.
    
    In via_auto_fill_adc_nids(), the parser tries to fill dac_nids[] at
    the point of the current line-out (i).  When no valid path is found
    for this output, this results in dac = 0, thus it creates a hole in
    dac_nids[].  This confuses is_empty_dac() and trims the detected DAC
    in later reference.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by appending DAC properly to dac_nids[] in
    via_auto_fill_adc_nids().

    cifs: fix potential buffer overrun in cifs.idmap handling code
    
    commit 36960e440ccf94349c09fb944930d3bfe4bc473f upstream.
    
    The userspace cifs.idmap program generally works with the wbclient libs
    to generate binary SIDs in userspace. That program defines the struct
    that holds these values as having a max of 15 subauthorities. The kernel
    idmapping code however limits that value to 5.
    
    When the kernel copies those values around though, it doesn't sanity
    check the num_subauths value handed back from userspace or from the
    server. It's possible therefore for userspace to hand us back a bogus
    num_subauths value (or one that's valid, but greater than 5) that could
    cause the kernel to walk off the end of the cifs_sid->sub_auths array.
    
    Fix this by defining a new routine for copying sids and using that in
    all of the places that copy it. If we end up with a sid that's longer
    than expected then this approach will just lop off the "extra" subauths,
    but that's basically what the code does today already. Better approaches
    might be to fix this code to reject SIDs with >5 subauths, or fix it
    to handle the subauths array dynamically.
    
    At the same time, change the kernel to check the length of the data
    returned by userspace. If it's shorter than struct cifs_sid, reject it
    and return -EIO. If that happens we'll end up with fields that are
    basically uninitialized.
    
    Long term, it might make sense to redefine cifs_sid using a flexarray at
    the end, to allow for variable-length subauth lists, and teach the code
    to handle the case where the subauths array being passed in from
    userspace is shorter than 5 elements.
    
    Note too, that I don't consider this a security issue since you'd need
    a compromised cifs.idmap program. If you have that, you can do all sorts
    of nefarious stuff. Still, this is probably reasonable for stable.

    virtio: Don't access index after unregister.
    
    commit 237242bddc99041e15a4ca51b8439657cadaff17 upstream.
    
    Virtio wants to release used indices after the corresponding
    virtio device has been unregistered. However, virtio does not
    hold an extra reference, giving up its last reference with
    device_unregister(), making accessing dev->index afterwards
    invalid.
    
    I actually saw problems when testing my (not-yet-merged)
    virtio-ccw code:
    
    - device_add virtio-net,id=xxx
    -> creates device virtio<n> with n>0
    
    - device_del xxx
    -> deletes virtio<n>, but calls ida_simple_remove with an
       index of 0
    
    - device_add virtio-net,id=xxx
    -> tries to add virtio0, which is still in use...
    
    So let's save the index we want to release before calling
    device_unregister().

    module: fix out-by-one error in kallsyms
    
    commit 59ef28b1f14899b10d6b2682c7057ca00a9a3f47 upstream.
    
    Masaki found and patched a kallsyms issue: the last symbol in a
    module's symtab wasn't transferred.  This is because we manually copy
    the zero'th entry (which is always empty) then copy the rest in a loop
    starting at 1, though from src[0].  His fix was minimal, I prefer to
    rewrite the loops in more standard form.
    
    There are two loops: one to get the size, and one to copy.  Make these
    identical: always count entry 0 and any defined symbol in an allocated
    non-init section.
    
    This bug exists since the following commit was introduced.

    PCI/PM: Fix proc config reg access for D3cold and bridge suspending
    
    commit b3c32c4f9565f93407921c0d8a4458042eb8998e upstream.
    
    In https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48981
    Peter reported that /proc/bus/pci/??/??.? does not work for 3.6.
    This is because the device configuration space registers are
    not accessible if the corresponding parent bridge is suspended or
    the device is put into D3cold state.
    
    This is the same as /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:??:??.?/config access
    issue.  So the function used to solve sysfs issue is used to solve
    this issue.
    
    This patch moves pci_config_pm_runtime_get()/_put() from pci/pci-sysfs.c
    to pci/pci.c and makes them extern so they can be used by both the
    sysfs and proc paths.

    PCI/PM: Resume device before shutdown
    
    commit 3ff2de9ba1a2e22e548979dbcd46e999b22c93d8 upstream.
    
    Some actions during shutdown need device to be in D0 state, such as
    MSI shutdown etc, so resume device before shutdown.
    
    Without this patch, a device may not be enumerated after a kexec
    because the corresponding bridge is not in D0, so that
    configuration space of the device is not accessible.

    mac80211: don't send null data packet when not associated
    
    commit 20f544eea03db4b498942558b882d463ce575c3e upstream.
    
    On resume or firmware recovery, mac80211 sends a null
    data packet to see if the AP is still around and hasn't
    disconnected us. However, it always does this even if
    it wasn't even connected before, leading to a warning
    in the new channel context code. Fix this by checking
    that it's associated.

    xfs: drop buffer io reference when a bad bio is built
    
    commit d69043c42d8c6414fa28ad18d99973aa6c1c2e24 upstream.
    
    Error handling in xfs_buf_ioapply_map() does not handle IO reference
    counts correctly. We increment the b_io_remaining count before
    building the bio, but then fail to decrement it in the failure case.
    This leads to the buffer never running IO completion and releasing
    the reference that the IO holds, so at unmount we can leak the
    buffer. This leak is captured by this assert failure during unmount:
    
    XFS: Assertion failed: atomic_read(&pag->pag_ref) == 0, file: fs/xfs/xfs_mount.c, line: 273
    
    This is not a new bug - the b_io_remaining accounting has had this
    problem for a long, long time - it's just very hard to get a
    zero length bio being built by this code...
    
    Further, the buffer IO error can be overwritten on a multi-segment
    buffer by subsequent bio completions for partial sections of the
    buffer. Hence we should only set the buffer error status if the
    buffer is not already carrying an error status. This ensures that a
    partial IO error on a multi-segment buffer will not be lost. This
    part of the problem is a regression, however.

    mm: bugfix: set current->reclaim_state to NULL while returning from kswapd()
    
    commit b0a8cc58e6b9aaae3045752059e5e6260c0b94bc upstream.
    
    In kswapd(), set current->reclaim_state to NULL before returning, as
    current->reclaim_state holds reference to variable on kswapd()'s stack.
    
    In rare cases, while returning from kswapd() during memory offlining,
    __free_slab() and freepages() can access the dangling pointer of
    current->reclaim_state.
