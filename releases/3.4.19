    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix mutex deadlock at disconnection
    
    commit 10e44239f67d0b6fb74006e61a7e883b8075247a upstream.
    
    The recent change for USB-audio disconnection race fixes introduced a
    mutex deadlock again.  There is a circular dependency between
    chip->shutdown_rwsem and pcm->open_mutex, depicted like below, when a
    device is opened during the disconnection operation:
    
    A. snd_usb_audio_disconnect() ->
         card.c::register_mutex ->
           chip->shutdown_rwsem (write) ->
             snd_card_disconnect() ->
               pcm.c::register_mutex ->
                 pcm->open_mutex
    
    B. snd_pcm_open() ->
         pcm->open_mutex ->
           snd_usb_pcm_open() ->
             chip->shutdown_rwsem (read)
    
    Since the chip->shutdown_rwsem protection in the case A is required
    only for turning on the chip->shutdown flag and it doesn't have to be
    taken for the whole operation, we can reduce its window in
    snd_usb_audio_disconnect().

    - OSS PCM and mixer success paths
    - When lookup function gets NULL

    xfs: fix reading of wrapped log data
    
    commit 6ce377afd1755eae5c93410ca9a1121dfead7b87 upstream.
    
    Commit 4439647 ("xfs: reset buffer pointers before freeing them") in
    3.0-rc1 introduced a regression when recovering log buffers that
    wrapped around the end of log. The second part of the log buffer at
    the start of the physical log was being read into the header buffer
    rather than the data buffer, and hence recovery was seeing garbage
    in the data buffer when it got to the region of the log buffer that
    was incorrectly read.

    drm/i915: fixup infoframe support for sdvo
    
    commit 81014b9d0b55fb0b48f26cd2a943359750d532db upstream.
    
    At least the worst offenders:
    - SDVO specifies that the encoder should compute the ecc. Testing also
      shows that we must not send the ecc field, so copy the dip_infoframe
      struct to a temporay place and avoid the ecc field. This way the avi
      infoframe is exactly 17 bytes long, which agrees with what the spec
      mandates as a minimal storage capacity (with the ecc field it would
      be 18 bytes).
    - Only 17 when sending the avi infoframe. The SDVO spec explicitly
      says that sending more data than what the device announces results
      in undefined behaviour.
    - Add __attribute__((packed)) to the avi and spd infoframes, for
      otherwise they're wrongly aligned. Noticed because the avi infoframe
      ended up being 18 bytes large instead of 17. We haven't noticed this
      yet because we don't use the uint16_t fields yet (which are the only
      ones that would be wrongly aligned).

    futex: Handle futex_pi OWNER_DIED take over correctly
    
    commit 59fa6245192159ab5e1e17b8e31f15afa9cff4bf upstream.
    
    Siddhesh analyzed a failure in the take over of pi futexes in case the
    owner died and provided a workaround.
    See: http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14076
    
    The detailed problem analysis shows:
    
    Futex F is initialized with PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT and
    PTHREAD_MUTEX_ROBUST_NP attributes.
    
    T1 lock_futex_pi(F);
    
    T2 lock_futex_pi(F);
       --> T2 blocks on the futex and creates pi_state which is associated
           to T1.
    
    T1 exits
       --> exit_robust_list() runs
           --> Futex F userspace value TID field is set to 0 and
               FUTEX_OWNER_DIED bit is set.
    
    T3 lock_futex_pi(F);
       --> Succeeds due to the check for F's userspace TID field == 0
       --> Claims ownership of the futex and sets its own TID into the
           userspace TID field of futex F
       --> returns to user space
    
    T1 --> exit_pi_state_list()
           --> Transfers pi_state to waiter T2 and wakes T2 via
               rt_mutex_unlock(&pi_state->mutex)
    
    T2 --> acquires pi_state->mutex and gains real ownership of the
           pi_state
       --> Claims ownership of the futex and sets its own TID into the
           userspace TID field of futex F
       --> returns to user space
    
    T3 --> observes inconsistent state
    
    This problem is independent of UP/SMP, preemptible/non preemptible
    kernels, or process shared vs. private. The only difference is that
    certain configurations are more likely to expose it.
    
    So as Siddhesh correctly analyzed the following check in
    futex_lock_pi_atomic() is the culprit:
    
            if (unlikely(ownerdied || !(curval & FUTEX_TID_MASK))) {
    
    We check the userspace value for a TID value of 0 and take over the
    futex unconditionally if that's true.
    
    AFAICT this check is there as it is correct for a different corner
    case of futexes: the WAITERS bit became stale.
    
    Now the proposed change
    
    -       if (unlikely(ownerdied || !(curval & FUTEX_TID_MASK))) {
    +       if (unlikely(ownerdied ||
    +                       !(curval & (FUTEX_TID_MASK | FUTEX_WAITERS)))) {
    
    solves the problem, but it's not obvious why and it wreckages the
    "stale WAITERS bit" case.
    
    What happens is, that due to the WAITERS bit being set (T2 is blocked
    on that futex) it enforces T3 to go through lookup_pi_state(), which
    in the above case returns an existing pi_state and therefor forces T3
    to legitimately fight with T2 over the ownership of the pi_state (via
    pi_state->mutex). Probelm solved!
    
    Though that does not work for the "WAITERS bit is stale" problem
    because if lookup_pi_state() does not find existing pi_state it
    returns -ERSCH (due to TID == 0) which causes futex_lock_pi() to
    return -ESRCH to user space because the OWNER_DIED bit is not set.
    
    Now there is a different solution to that problem. Do not look at the
    user space value at all and enforce a lookup of possibly available
    pi_state. If pi_state can be found, then the new incoming locker T3
    blocks on that pi_state and legitimately races with T2 to acquire the
    rt_mutex and the pi_state and therefor the proper ownership of the
    user space futex.
    
    lookup_pi_state() has the correct order of checks. It first tries to
    find a pi_state associated with the user space futex and only if that
    fails it checks for futex TID value = 0. If no pi_state is available
    nothing can create new state at that point because this happens with
    the hash bucket lock held.
    
    So the above scenario changes to:
    
    T1 lock_futex_pi(F);
    
    T2 lock_futex_pi(F);
       --> T2 blocks on the futex and creates pi_state which is associated
           to T1.
    
    T1 exits
       --> exit_robust_list() runs
           --> Futex F userspace value TID field is set to 0 and
               FUTEX_OWNER_DIED bit is set.
    
    T3 lock_futex_pi(F);
       --> Finds pi_state and blocks on pi_state->rt_mutex
    
    T1 --> exit_pi_state_list()
           --> Transfers pi_state to waiter T2 and wakes it via
               rt_mutex_unlock(&pi_state->mutex)
    
    T2 --> acquires pi_state->mutex and gains ownership of the pi_state
       --> Claims ownership of the futex and sets its own TID into the
           userspace TID field of futex F
       --> returns to user space
    
    This covers all gazillion points on which T3 might come in between
    T1's exit_robust_list() clearing the TID field and T2 fixing it up. It
    also solves the "WAITERS bit stale" problem by forcing the take over.
    
    Another benefit of changing the code this way is that it makes it less
    dependent on untrusted user space values and therefor minimizes the
    possible wreckage which might be inflicted.
    
    As usual after staring for too long at the futex code my brain hurts
    so much that I really want to ditch that whole optimization of
    avoiding the syscall for the non contended case for PI futexes and rip
    out the maze of corner case handling code. Unfortunately we can't as
    user space relies on that existing behaviour, but at least thinking
    about it helps me to preserve my mental sanity. Maybe we should
    nevertheless :)

    l2tp: fix oops in l2tp_eth_create() error path
    
    [ Upstream commit 789336360e0a2aeb9750c16ab704a02cbe035e9e ]
    
    When creating an L2TPv3 Ethernet session, if register_netdev() should fail for
    any reason (for example, automatic naming for "l2tpeth%d" interfaces hits the
    32k-interface limit), the netdev is freed in the error path.  However, the
    l2tp_eth_sess structure's dev pointer is left uncleared, and this results in
    l2tp_eth_delete() then attempting to unregister the same netdev later in the
    session teardown.  This results in an oops.
    
    To avoid this, clear the session dev pointer in the error path.

    net: fix divide by zero in tcp algorithm illinois
    
    [ Upstream commit 8f363b77ee4fbf7c3bbcf5ec2c5ca482d396d664 ]
    
    Reading TCP stats when using TCP Illinois congestion control algorithm
    can cause a divide by zero kernel oops.
    
    The division by zero occur in tcp_illinois_info() at:
     do_div(t, ca->cnt_rtt);
    where ca->cnt_rtt can become zero (when rtt_reset is called)
    
    Steps to Reproduce:
     1. Register tcp_illinois:
         # sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=illinois
     2. Monitor internal TCP information via command "ss -i"
         # watch -d ss -i
     3. Establish new TCP conn to machine
    
    Either it fails at the initial conn, or else it needs to wait
    for a loss or a reset.
    
    This is only related to reading stats.  The function avg_delay() also
    performs the same divide, but is guarded with a (ca->cnt_rtt > 0) at its
    calling point in update_params().  Thus, simply fix tcp_illinois_info().
    
    Function tcp_illinois_info() / get_info() is called without
    socket lock.  Thus, eliminate any race condition on ca->cnt_rtt
    by using a local stack variable.  Simply reuse info.tcpv_rttcnt,
    as its already set to ca->cnt_rtt.
    Function avg_delay() is not affected by this race condition, as
    its called with the socket lock.

    net: usb: Fix memory leak on Tx data path
    
    [ Upstream commit 39707c2a3ba5011038b363f84d37c8a98d2d9db1 ]
    
    Driver anchors the tx urbs and defers the urb submission if
    a transmit request comes when the interface is suspended.
    Anchoring urb increments the urb reference count. These
    deferred urbs are later accessed by calling usb_get_from_anchor()
    for submission during interface resume. usb_get_from_anchor()
    unanchors the urb but urb reference count remains same.
    This causes the urb reference count to remain non-zero
    after usb_free_urb() gets called and urb never gets freed.
    Hence call usb_put_urb() after anchoring the urb to properly
    balance the reference count for these deferred urbs. Also,
    unanchor these deferred urbs during disconnect, to free them
    up.

    [ Upstream commit a3374c42aa5f7237e87ff3b0622018636b0c847e ]
    
    tcp_ioctl() tries to take into account if tcp socket received a FIN
    to report correct number bytes in receive queue.
    
    But its flaky because if the application ate the last skb,
    we return 1 instead of 0.
    
    Correct way to detect that FIN was received is to test SOCK_DONE.

    netlink: use kfree_rcu() in netlink_release()
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d772ac5578f711d1ce7b03535d1c95bffb21dff ]
    
    On some suspend/resume operations involving wimax device, we have
    noticed some intermittent memory corruptions in netlink code.
    
    Stéphane Marchesin tracked this corruption in netlink_update_listeners()
    and suggested a patch.
    
    It appears netlink_release() should use kfree_rcu() instead of kfree()
    for the listeners structure as it may be used by other cpus using RCU
    protection.
    
    netlink_release() must set to NULL the listeners pointer when
    it is about to be freed.
    
    Also have to protect netlink_update_listeners() and
    netlink_has_listeners() if listeners is NULL.
    
    Add a nl_deref_protected() lockdep helper to properly document which
    locks protects us.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix races at disconnection
    
    commit 978520b75f0a1ce82b17e1e8186417250de6d545 upstream.
    
    Close some races at disconnection of a USB audio device by adding the
    chip->shutdown_mutex and chip->shutdown check at appropriate places.
    
    The spots to put bandaids are:
    - PCM prepare, hw_params and hw_free
    - where the usb device is accessed for communication or get speed, in
     mixer.c and others; the device speed is now cached in subs->speed
     instead of accessing to chip->dev
    
    The accesses in PCM open and close don't need the mutex protection
    because these are already handled in the core PCM disconnection code.
    
    The autosuspend/autoresume codes are still uncovered by this patch
    because of possible mutex deadlocks.  They'll be covered by the
    upcoming change to rwsem.
    
    Also the mixer codes are untouched, too.  These will be fixed in
    another patch, too.

    NFS: fix bug in legacy DNS resolver.
    
    commit 8d96b10639fb402357b75b055b1e82a65ff95050 upstream.
    
    The DNS resolver's use of the sunrpc cache involves a 'ttl' number
    (relative) rather that a timeout (absolute).  This confused me when
    I wrote
      commit c5b29f885afe890f953f7f23424045cdad31d3e4
         "sunrpc: use seconds since boot in expiry cache"
    
    and I managed to break it.  The effect is that any TTL is interpreted
    as 0, and nothing useful gets into the cache.
    
    This patch removes the use of get_expiry() - which really expects an
    expiry time - and uses get_uint() instead, treating the int correctly
    as a ttl.
    
    This fixes a regression that has been present since 2.6.37, causing
    certain NFS accesses in certain environments to incorrectly fail.

    nfs: Show original device name verbatim in /proc/*/mount{s,info}
    
    commit 97a54868262da1629a3e65121e65b8e8c4419d9f upstream.
    
    Since commit c7f404b ('vfs: new superblock methods to override
    /proc/*/mount{s,info}'), nfs_path() is used to generate the mounted
    device name reported back to userland.
    
    nfs_path() always generates a trailing slash when the given dentry is
    the root of an NFS mount, but userland may expect the original device
    name to be returned verbatim (as it used to be).  Make this
    canonicalisation optional and change the callers accordingly.

    nfsv3: Make v3 mounts fail with ETIMEDOUTs instead EIO on mountd timeouts
    
    commit acce94e68a0f346115fd41cdc298197d2d5a59ad upstream.
    
    In very busy v3 environment, rpc.mountd can respond to the NULL
    procedure but not the MNT procedure in a timely manner causing
    the MNT procedure to time out. The problem is the mount system
    call returns EIO which causes the mount to fail, instead of
    ETIMEDOUT, which would cause the mount to be retried.
    
    This patch sets the RPC_TASK_SOFT|RPC_TASK_TIMEOUT flags to
    the rpc_call_sync() call in nfs_mount() which causes
    ETIMEDOUT to be returned on timed out connections.

    mac80211: fix SSID copy on IBSS JOIN
    
    commit badecb001a310408d3473b1fc2ed5aefd0bc92a9 upstream.
    
    The 'ssid' field of the cfg80211_ibss_params is a u8 pointer and
    its length is likely to be less than IEEE80211_MAX_SSID_LEN most
    of the time.
    
    This patch fixes the ssid copy in ieee80211_ibss_join() by using
    the SSID length to prevent it from reading beyond the string.

    The code to allow EAPOL frames even when the station

    When buffer sharing with the i915 and using a 1680x1050 monitor,
    the i915 gives is a 6912 buffer for the 6720 width, the code doesn't

    cfg80211: fix antenna gain handling
    
    commit c4a9fafc77a5318f5ed26c509bbcddf03e18c201 upstream.
    
    No driver initializes chan->max_antenna_gain to something sensible, and
    the only place where it is being used right now is inside ath9k. This
    leads to ath9k potentially using less tx power than it can use, which can
    decrease performance/range in some rare cases.
    
    Rather than going through every single driver, this patch initializes
    chan->orig_mag in wiphy_register(), ignoring whatever value the driver
    left in there. If a driver for some reason wishes to limit it independent
    from regulatory rulesets, it can do so internally.

    iscsi-target: Fix missed wakeup race in TX thread
    
    commit d5627acba9ae584cf4928af19f7ddf5f6837de32 upstream.
    
    The sleeping code in iscsi_target_tx_thread() is susceptible to the classic
    missed wakeup race:
    
     - TX thread finishes handle_immediate_queue() and handle_response_queue(),
       thinks both queues are empty.
     - Another thread adds a queue entry and does wake_up_process(), which does
       nothing because the TX thread is still awake.
     - TX thread does schedule_timeout() and sleeps forever.
    
    In practice this can kill an iSCSI connection if for example an initiator
    does single-threaded writes and the target misses the wakeup window when
    queueing an R2T; in this case the connection will be stuck until the
    initiator loses patience and does some task management operation (or kills
    the connection entirely).
    
    Fix this by converting to wait_event_interruptible(), which does not
    suffer from this sort of race.

    The expression (max_sectors * block_size) might overflow a u32

    EEPROM, but step is equal to 0xff. This results on ridiculous delta
    calculations and completely broke TX power settings.

    ath9k: Test for TID only in BlockAcks while checking tx status
    
    commit 6fe7cc71bbf3a0bc28c9cec3c00bc11e81344412 upstream.
    
    The ath9k xmit functions for AMPDUs can send frames as non-aggregate in case
    only one frame is currently available. The client will then answer using a
    normal Ack instead of a BlockAck. This acknowledgement has no TID stored and
    therefore the hardware is not able to provide us the corresponding TID.
    
    The TID set by the hardware in the tx status descriptor has to be seen as
    undefined and not as a valid TID value for normal acknowledgements. Doing
    otherwise results in a massive amount of retransmissions and stalls of
    connections.
    
    Users may experience low bandwidth and complete connection stalls in
    environments with transfers using multiple TIDs.
    
    This regression was introduced in b11b160defc48e4daa283f785192ea3a23a51f8e
    ("ath9k: validate the TID in the tx status information").

    ath9k: fix stale pointers potentially causing access to free'd skbs
    
    commit 8c6e30936a7893a85f6222084f0f26aceb81137a upstream.
    
    bf->bf_next is only while buffers are chained as part of an A-MPDU
    in the tx queue. When a tid queue is flushed (e.g. on tearing down
    an aggregation session), frames can be enqueued again as normal
    transmission, without bf_next being cleared. This can lead to the
    old pointer being dereferenced again later.
    
    This patch might fix crashes and "Failed to stop TX DMA!" messages.

    Input: tsc40 - remove wrong announcement of pressure support
    
    commit 32ed1911fc79908d704023317d4ddeb3883fd07e upstream.
    
    The tsc40 driver announces it supports the pressure event, but will never
    send one. The announcement will cause tslib to wait for such events and
    sending all touch events with a pressure of 0. Removing the announcement
    will make tslib fall back to emulating the pressure on touch events so
    everything works as expected.

    xen/mmu: Use Xen specific TLB flush instead of the generic one.
    
    commit 95a7d76897c1e7243d4137037c66d15cbf2cce76 upstream.
    
    As Mukesh explained it, the MMUEXT_TLB_FLUSH_ALL allows the
    hypervisor to do a TLB flush on all active vCPUs. If instead
    we were using the generic one (which ends up being xen_flush_tlb)
    we end up making the MMUEXT_TLB_FLUSH_LOCAL hypercall. But
    before we make that hypercall the kernel will IPI all of the
    vCPUs (even those that were asleep from the hypervisor
    perspective). The end result is that we needlessly wake them
    up and do a TLB flush when we can just let the hypervisor
    do it correctly.
    
    This patch gives around 50% speed improvement when migrating
    idle guest's from one host to another.
