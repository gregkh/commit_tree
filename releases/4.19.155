    commit 49d28ebdf1e30d806410eefc7de0a7a1ca5d747c upstream.
    
    Currently in case of alignment or FCS error if the packet cannot be
    corrected it's still not dropped. Report the error properly and drop the
    packet while making the code around a little bit more readable.

    staging: comedi: cb_pcidas: Allow 2-channel commands for AO subdevice
    
    commit 647a6002cb41d358d9ac5de101a8a6dc74748a59 upstream.
    
    The "cb_pcidas" driver supports asynchronous commands on the analog
    output (AO) subdevice for those boards that have an AO FIFO.  The code
    (in `cb_pcidas_ao_check_chanlist()` and `cb_pcidas_ao_cmd()`) to
    validate and set up the command supports output to a single channel or
    to two channels simultaneously (the boards have two AO channels).
    However, the code in `cb_pcidas_auto_attach()` that initializes the
    subdevices neglects to initialize the AO subdevice's `len_chanlist`
    member, leaving it set to 0, but the Comedi core will "correct" it to 1
    if the driver neglected to set it.  This limits commands to use a single
    channel (either channel 0 or 1), but the limit should be two channels.
    Set the AO subdevice's `len_chanlist` member to be the same value as the
    `n_chan` member, which will be 2.

    device property: Don't clear secondary pointer for shared primary firmware node
    
    commit 99aed9227073fb34ce2880cbc7063e04185a65e1 upstream.
    
    It appears that firmware nodes can be shared between devices. In such case
    when a (child) device is about to be deleted, its firmware node may be shared
    and ACPI_COMPANION_SET(..., NULL) call for it breaks the secondary link
    of the shared primary firmware node.
    
    In order to prevent that, check, if the device has a parent and parent's
    firmware node is shared with its child, and avoid crashing the link.

    device property: Keep secondary firmware node secondary by type
    
    commit d5dcce0c414fcbfe4c2037b66ac69ea5f9b3f75c upstream.
    
    Behind primary and secondary we understand the type of the nodes
    which might define their ordering. However, if primary node gone,
    we can't maintain the ordering by definition of the linked list.
    Thus, by ordering secondary node becomes first in the list.
    But in this case the meaning of it is still secondary (or auxiliary).
    The type of the node is maintained by the secondary pointer in it:
    
            secondary pointer               Meaning
            NULL or valid                   primary node
            ERR_PTR(-ENODEV)                secondary node
    
    So, if by some reason we do the following sequence of calls
    
            set_primary_fwnode(dev, NULL);
            set_primary_fwnode(dev, primary);
    
    we should preserve secondary node.
    
    This concept is supported by the description of set_primary_fwnode()
    along with implementation of set_secondary_fwnode(). Hence, fix
    the commit c15e1bdda436 to follow this as well.

    hil/parisc: Disable HIL driver when it gets stuck
    
    commit 879bc2d27904354b98ca295b6168718e045c4aa2 upstream.
    
    When starting a HP machine with HIL driver but without an HIL keyboard
    or HIL mouse attached, it may happen that data written to the HIL loop
    gets stuck (e.g. because the transaction queue is full).  Usually one
    will then have to reboot the machine because all you see is and endless
    output of:
     Transaction add failed: transaction already queued?
    
    In the higher layers hp_sdc_enqueue_transaction() is called to queued up
    a HIL packet. This function returns an error code, and this patch adds
    the necessary checks for this return code and disables the HIL driver if
    further packets can't be sent.
    
    Tested on a HP 730 and a HP 715/64 machine.

    tty: make FONTX ioctl use the tty pointer they were actually passed
    
    commit 90bfdeef83f1d6c696039b6a917190dcbbad3220 upstream.
    
    Some of the font tty ioctl's always used the current foreground VC for
    their operations.  Don't do that then.
    
    This fixes a data race on fg_console.
    
    Side note: both Michael Ellerman and Jiri Slaby point out that all these
    ioctls are deprecated, and should probably have been removed long ago,
    and everything seems to be using the KDFONTOP ioctl instead.
    
    In fact, Michael points out that it looks like busybox's loadfont
    program seems to have switched over to using KDFONTOP exactly _because_
    of this bug (ahem.. 12 years ago ;-).

    commit d3b14296da69adb7825022f3224ac6137eb30abf upstream.
    
    The way the driver is implemented is buggy for the (admittedly unlikely)
    use case where there are two RTCs with one having an interrupt configured
    and the second not. This is caused by the fact that we use a global
    rtc_class_ops struct which we modify depending on whether the irq number
    is present or not.
    
    Fix it by using two const ops structs with and without alarm operations.
    While at it: not being able to request a configured interrupt is an error
    so don't ignore it and bail out of probe().

    vringh: fix __vringh_iov() when riov and wiov are different
    
    commit 5745bcfbbf89b158416075374254d3c013488f21 upstream.
    
    If riov and wiov are both defined and they point to different
    objects, only riov is initialized. If the wiov is not initialized
    by the caller, the function fails returning -EINVAL and printing
    "Readable desc 0x... after writable" error message.
    
    This issue happens when descriptors have both readable and writable
    buffers (eg. virtio-blk devices has virtio_blk_outhdr in the readable
    buffer and status as last byte of writable buffer) and we call
    __vringh_iov() to get both type of buffers in two different iovecs.
    
    Let's replace the 'else if' clause with 'if' to initialize both
    riov and wiov if they are not NULL.
    
    As checkpatch pointed out, we also avoid crashing the kernel
    when riov and wiov are both NULL, replacing BUG() with WARN_ON()
    and returning -EINVAL.

    libceph: clear con->out_msg on Policy::stateful_server faults
    
    commit 28e1581c3b4ea5f98530064a103c6217bedeea73 upstream.
    
    con->out_msg must be cleared on Policy::stateful_server
    (!CEPH_MSG_CONNECT_LOSSY) faults.  Not doing so botches the
    reconnection attempt, because after writing the banner the
    messenger moves on to writing the data section of that message
    (either from where it got interrupted by the connection reset or
    from the beginning) instead of writing struct ceph_msg_connect.
    This results in a bizarre error message because the server
    sends CEPH_MSGR_TAG_BADPROTOVER but we think we wrote struct
    ceph_msg_connect:
    
      libceph: mds0 (1)172.21.15.45:6828 socket error on write
      ceph: mds0 reconnect start
      libceph: mds0 (1)172.21.15.45:6829 socket closed (con state OPEN)
      libceph: mds0 (1)172.21.15.45:6829 protocol version mismatch, my 32 != server's 32
      libceph: mds0 (1)172.21.15.45:6829 protocol version mismatch
    
    AFAICT this bug goes back to the dawn of the kernel client.
    The reason it survived for so long is that only MDS sessions
    are stateful and only two MDS messages have a data section:
    CEPH_MSG_CLIENT_RECONNECT (always, but reconnecting is rare)
    and CEPH_MSG_CLIENT_REQUEST (only when xattrs are involved).
    The connection has to get reset precisely when such message
    is being sent -- in this case it was the former.

    drm/amd/display: Don't invoke kgdb_breakpoint() unconditionally
    
    commit 8b7dc1fe1a5c1093551f6cd7dfbb941bd9081c2e upstream.
    
    ASSERT_CRITICAL() invokes kgdb_breakpoint() whenever either
    CONFIG_KGDB or CONFIG_HAVE_KGDB is set.  This, however, may lead to a
    kernel panic when no kdb stuff is attached, since the
    kgdb_breakpoint() call issues INT3.  It's nothing but a surprise for
    normal end-users.
    
    For avoiding the pitfall, make the kgdb_breakpoint() call only when
    CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL_DC is set.

    i2c: imx: Fix external abort on interrupt in exit paths
    
    commit e50e4f0b85be308a01b830c5fbdffc657e1a6dd0 upstream.
    
    If interrupt comes late, during probe error path or device remove (could
    be triggered with CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ), the interrupt handler
    i2c_imx_isr() will access registers with the clock being disabled.  This
    leads to external abort on non-linefetch on Toradex Colibri VF50 module
    (with Vybrid VF5xx):

    Additionally, the i2c_imx_isr() could wake up the wait queue
    (imx_i2c_struct->queue) before its initialization happens.
    
    The resource-managed framework should not be used for interrupt handling,
    because the resource will be released too late - after disabling clocks.
    The interrupt handler is not prepared for such case.

    ubi: check kthread_should_stop() after the setting of task state
    
    commit d005f8c6588efcfbe88099b6edafc6f58c84a9c1 upstream.
    
    A detach hung is possible when a race occurs between the detach process
    and the ubi background thread. The following sequences outline the race:
    
      ubi thread: if (list_empty(&ubi->works)...
    
      ubi detach: set_bit(KTHREAD_SHOULD_STOP, &kthread->flags)
                  => by kthread_stop()
                  wake_up_process()
                  => ubi thread is still running, so 0 is returned
    
      ubi thread: set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE)
                  schedule()
                  => ubi thread will never be scheduled again
    
      ubi detach: wait_for_completion()
                  => hung task!
    
    To fix that, we need to check kthread_should_stop() after we set the
    task state, so the ubi thread will either see the stop bit and exit or
    the task state is reset to runnable such that it isn't scheduled out
    indefinitely.

    perf python scripting: Fix printable strings in python3 scripts
    
    commit 6fcd5ddc3b1467b3586972ef785d0d926ae4cdf4 upstream.
    
    Hagen reported broken strings in python3 tracepoint scripts:
    
      make PYTHON=python3
      perf record -e sched:sched_switch -a -- sleep 5
      perf script --gen-script py
      perf script -s ./perf-script.py

    The problem is in the is_printable_array function that does not take the
    zero byte into account and claim such string as not printable, so the
    code will create byte array instead of string.

    NFSD: Add missing NFSv2 .pc_func methods
    
    commit 6b3dccd48de8a4c650b01499a0b09d1e2279649e upstream.
    
    There's no protection in nfsd_dispatch() against a NULL .pc_func
    helpers. A malicious NFS client can trigger a crash by invoking the
    unused/unsupported NFSv2 ROOT or WRITECACHE procedures.
    
    The current NFSD dispatcher does not support returning a void reply
    to a non-NULL procedure, so the reply to both of these is wrong, for
    the moment.

    commit 8c39076c276be0b31982e44654e2c2357473258a upstream.
    
    RFC 7862 introduced a new flag that either client or server is
    allowed to set: EXCHGID4_FLAG_SUPP_FENCE_OPS.
    
    Client needs to update its bitmask to allow for this flag value.

    powerpc: Fix undetected data corruption with P9N DD2.1 VSX CI load emulation
    
    commit 1da4a0272c5469169f78cd76cf175ff984f52f06 upstream.
    
    __get_user_atomic_128_aligned() stores to kaddr using stvx which is a
    VMX store instruction, hence kaddr must be 16 byte aligned otherwise
    the store won't occur as expected.
    
    Unfortunately when we call __get_user_atomic_128_aligned() in
    p9_hmi_special_emu(), the buffer we pass as kaddr (ie. vbuf) isn't
    guaranteed to be 16B aligned. This means that the write to vbuf in
    __get_user_atomic_128_aligned() has the bottom bits of the address
    truncated. This results in other local variables being
    overwritten. Also vbuf will not contain the correct data which results
    in the userspace emulation being wrong and hence undetected user data
    corruption.
    
    In the past we've been mostly lucky as vbuf has ended up aligned but
    this is fragile and isn't always true. CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR in
    particular can change the stack arrangement enough that our luck runs
    out.
    
    This issue only occurs on POWER9 Nimbus <= DD2.1 bare metal.
    
    The fix is to align vbuf to a 16 byte boundary.

    powerpc/powernv/elog: Fix race while processing OPAL error log event.
    
    commit aea948bb80b478ddc2448f7359d574387521a52d upstream.
    
    Every error log reported by OPAL is exported to userspace through a
    sysfs interface and notified using kobject_uevent(). The userspace
    daemon (opal_errd) then reads the error log and acknowledges the error
    log is saved safely to disk. Once acknowledged the kernel removes the
    respective sysfs file entry causing respective resources to be
    released including kobject.
    
    However it's possible the userspace daemon may already be scanning
    elog entries when a new sysfs elog entry is created by the kernel.
    User daemon may read this new entry and ack it even before kernel can
    notify userspace about it through kobject_uevent() call. If that
    happens then we have a potential race between
    elog_ack_store->kobject_put() and kobject_uevent which can lead to
    use-after-free of a kernfs object resulting in a kernel crash. eg:
    
      BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access on read at 0x6b6b6b6b6b6b6bfb

    This patch fixes this race by protecting the sysfs file
    creation/notification by holding a reference count on kobject until we
    safely send kobject_uevent().
    
    The function create_elog_obj() returns the elog object which if used
    by caller function will end up in use-after-free problem again.
    However, the return value of create_elog_obj() function isn't being
    used today and there is no need as well. Hence change it to return
    void to make this fix complete.

    powerpc/rtas: Restrict RTAS requests from userspace
    
    commit bd59380c5ba4147dcbaad3e582b55ccfd120b764 upstream.
    
    A number of userspace utilities depend on making calls to RTAS to retrieve
    information and update various things.
    
    The existing API through which we expose RTAS to userspace exposes more
    RTAS functionality than we actually need, through the sys_rtas syscall,
    which allows root (or anyone with CAP_SYS_ADMIN) to make any RTAS call they
    want with arbitrary arguments.
    
    Many RTAS calls take the address of a buffer as an argument, and it's up to
    the caller to specify the physical address of the buffer as an argument. We
    allocate a buffer (the "RMO buffer") in the Real Memory Area that RTAS can
    access, and then expose the physical address and size of this buffer in
    /proc/powerpc/rtas/rmo_buffer. Userspace is expected to read this address,
    poke at the buffer using /dev/mem, and pass an address in the RMO buffer to
    the RTAS call.
    
    However, there's nothing stopping the caller from specifying whatever
    address they want in the RTAS call, and it's easy to construct a series of
    RTAS calls that can overwrite arbitrary bytes (even without /dev/mem
    access).
    
    Additionally, there are some RTAS calls that do potentially dangerous
    things and for which there are no legitimate userspace use cases.
    
    In the past, this would not have been a particularly big deal as it was
    assumed that root could modify all system state freely, but with Secure
    Boot and lockdown we need to care about this.
    
    We can't fundamentally change the ABI at this point, however we can address
    this by implementing a filter that checks RTAS calls against a list
    of permitted calls and forces the caller to use addresses within the RMO
    buffer.
    
    The list is based off the list of calls that are used by the librtas
    userspace library, and has been tested with a number of existing userspace
    RTAS utilities. For compatibility with any applications we are not aware of
    that require other calls, the filter can be turned off at build time.

    s390/stp: add locking to sysfs functions
    
    commit b3bd02495cb339124f13135d51940cf48d83e5cb upstream.
    
    The sysfs function might race with stp_work_fn. To prevent that,
    add the required locking. Another issue is that the sysfs functions
    are checking the stp_online flag, but this flag just holds the user
    setting whether STP is enabled. Add a flag to clock_sync_flag whether
    stp_info holds valid data and use that instead.

    iio:gyro:itg3200: Fix timestamp alignment and prevent data leak.
    
    commit 10ab7cfd5522f0041028556dac864a003e158556 upstream.
    
    One of a class of bugs pointed out by Lars in a recent review.
    iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp assumes the buffer used is aligned
    to the size of the timestamp (8 bytes).  This is not guaranteed in
    this driver which uses a 16 byte array of smaller elements on the stack.
    This is fixed by using an explicit c structure. As there are no
    holes in the structure, there is no possiblity of data leakage
    in this case.
    
    The explicit alignment of ts is not strictly necessary but potentially
    makes the code slightly less fragile.  It also removes the possibility
    of this being cut and paste into another driver where the alignment
    isn't already true.

    Depending on the enabled channels, the  location of the timestamp
    can be at various aligned offsets through the buffer.  As such we
    any use of a structure to enforce this alignment would incorrectly
    suggest a single location for the timestamp.  Comments adjusted to
    express this clearly in the code.

    It has recently been reported that the "heartbeat" report from devices

    Bluetooth-enabled Intuos tablets (CTL-4100WL, CTL-6100WL) can cause the
    driver to send a spurious BTN_TOUCH=0 once per second in the middle of
    drawing. This can result in broken lines while drawing on Chrome OS.
    
    The source of the issue has been traced back to a change which modified
    the driver to only call `wacom_wac_pad_report()` once per report instead
    of once per collection. As part of this change, pad-handling code was
    removed from `wacom_wac_collection()` under the assumption that the
    `WACOM_PEN_FIELD` and `WACOM_TOUCH_FIELD` checks would not be satisfied
    when a pad or battery collection was being processed.
    
    To be clear, the macros `WACOM_PAD_FIELD` and `WACOM_PEN_FIELD` do not
    currently check exclusive conditions. In fact, most "pad" fields will
    also appear to be "pen" fields simply due to their presence inside of
    a Digitizer application collection. Because of this, the removal of
    the check from `wacom_wac_collection()` just causes pad / battery
    collections to instead trigger a call to `wacom_wac_pen_report()`
    instead. The pen report function in turn resets the tip switch state
    just prior to exiting, resulting in the observed BTN_TOUCH=0 symptom.
    
    To correct this, we restore a version of the `WACOM_PAD_FIELD` check
    in `wacom_wac_collection()` and return early. This effectively prevents
    pad / battery collections from being reported until the very end of the
    report as originally intended.

    vt: keyboard, extend func_buf_lock to readers
    
    commit 82e61c3909db51d91b9d3e2071557b6435018b80 upstream.
    
    Both read-side users of func_table/func_buf need locking. Without that,
    one can easily confuse the code by repeatedly setting altering strings
    like:
    while (1)
            for (a = 0; a < 2; a++) {
                    struct kbsentry kbs = {};
                    strcpy((char *)kbs.kb_string, a ? ".\n" : "88888\n");
                    ioctl(fd, KDSKBSENT, &kbs);
            }
    
    When that program runs, one can get unexpected output by holding F1
    (note the unxpected period on the last line):
    .
    88888
    .8888
    
    So protect all accesses to 'func_table' (and func_buf) by preexisting
    'func_buf_lock'.
    
    It is easy in 'k_fn' handler as 'puts_queue' is expected not to sleep.
    On the other hand, KDGKBSENT needs a local (atomic) copy of the string
    because copy_to_user can sleep. Use already allocated, but unused
    'kbs->kb_string' for that purpose.
    
    Note that the program above needs at least CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG.
    
    This depends on the previous patch and on the func_buf_lock lock added
    in commit 46ca3f735f34 (tty/vt: fix write/write race in ioctl(KDSKBSENT)
    handler) in 5.2.
    
    Likely fixes CVE-2020-25656.

    vt: keyboard, simplify vt_kdgkbsent
    
    commit 6ca03f90527e499dd5e32d6522909e2ad390896b upstream.
    
    Use 'strlen' of the string, add one for NUL terminator and simply do
    'copy_to_user' instead of the explicit 'for' loop. This makes the
    KDGKBSENT case more compact.
    
    The only thing we need to take care about is NULL 'func_table[i]'. Use
    an empty string in that case.
    
    The original check for overflow could never trigger as the func_buf
    strings are always shorter or equal to 'struct kbsentry's.

    drm/i915: Force VT'd workarounds when running as a guest OS
    
    commit 8195400f7ea95399f721ad21f4d663a62c65036f upstream.
    
    If i915.ko is being used as a passthrough device, it does not know if
    the host is using intel_iommu. Mixing the iommu and gfx causes a few
    issues (such as scanout overfetch) which we need to workaround inside
    the driver, so if we detect we are running under a hypervisor, also
    assume the device access is being virtualised.

    usb: typec: tcpm: reset hard_reset_count for any disconnect
    
    commit 2d9c6442a9c81f4f8dee678d0b3c183173ab1e2d upstream.
    
    Current tcpm_detach() only reset hard_reset_count if port->attached
    is true, this may cause this counter clear is missed if the CC
    disconnect event is generated after tcpm_port_reset() is done
    by other events, e.g. VBUS off comes first before CC disconect for
    a power sink, in that case the first tcpm_detach() will only clear
    port->attached flag but leave hard_reset_count there because
    tcpm_port_is_disconnected() is still false, then later tcpm_detach()
    by CC disconnect will directly return due to port->attached is cleared,
    finally this will result tcpm will not try hard reset or error recovery
    for later attach.
    
    ChiYuan reported this issue on his platform with below tcpm trace:
    After power sink session setup after hard reset 2 times, detach
    from the power source and then attach:

    usb: cdc-acm: fix cooldown mechanism
    
    commit 38203b8385bf6283537162bde7d499f830964711 upstream.
    
    Commit a4e7279cd1d1 ("cdc-acm: introduce a cool down") is causing
    regression if there is some USB error, such as -EPROTO.
    
    This has been reported on some samples of the Odroid-N2 using the Combee II
    Zibgee USB dongle.
    
    > struct acm *acm = container_of(work, struct acm, work)
    
    is incorrect in case of a delayed work and causes warnings, usually from
    the workqueue:
    
    > WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at kernel/workqueue.c:1474 __queue_work+0x480/0x528.
    
    When this happens, USB eventually stops working completely after a while.
    Also the ACM_ERROR_DELAY bit is never set, so the cooldown mechanism
    previously introduced cannot be triggered and acm_submit_read_urb() is
    never called.
    
    This changes makes the cdc-acm driver use a single delayed work, fixing the
    pointer arithmetic in acm_softint() and set the ACM_ERROR_DELAY when the
    cooldown mechanism appear to be needed.

    usb: dwc3: ep0: Fix ZLP for OUT ep0 requests
    
    commit 66706077dc89c66a4777a4c6298273816afb848c upstream.
    
    The current ZLP handling for ep0 requests is only for control IN
    requests. For OUT direction, DWC3 needs to check and setup for MPS
    alignment.
    
    Usually, control OUT requests can indicate its transfer size via the
    wLength field of the control message. So usb_request->zero is usually
    not needed for OUT direction. To handle ZLP OUT for control endpoint,
    make sure the TRB is MPS size.

    btrfs: fix use-after-free on readahead extent after failure to create it
    
    commit 83bc1560e02e25c6439341352024ebe8488f4fbd upstream.
    
    If we fail to find suitable zones for a new readahead extent, we end up
    leaving a stale pointer in the global readahead extents radix tree
    (fs_info->reada_tree), which can trigger the following trace later on:

    What happens is the following:
    
    1) At reada_find_extent() we don't find any existing readahead extent for
       the metadata extent starting at logical address X;
    
    2) So we proceed to create a new one. We then call btrfs_map_block() to get
       information about which stripes contain extent X;
    
    3) After that we iterate over the stripes and create only one zone for the
       readahead extent - only one because reada_find_zone() returned NULL for
       all iterations except for one, either because a memory allocation failed
       or it couldn't find the block group of the extent (it may have just been
       deleted);
    
    4) We then add the new readahead extent to the readahead extents radix
       tree at fs_info->reada_tree;
    
    5) Then we iterate over each zone of the new readahead extent, and find
       that the device used for that zone no longer exists, because it was
       removed or it was the source device of a device replace operation.
       Since this left 'have_zone' set to 0, after finishing the loop we jump
       to the 'error' label, call kfree() on the new readahead extent and
       return without removing it from the radix tree at fs_info->reada_tree;
    
    6) Any future call to reada_find_extent() for the logical address X will
       find the stale pointer in the readahead extents radix tree, increment
       its reference counter, which can trigger the use-after-free right
       away or return it to the caller reada_add_block() that results in the
       use-after-free of the example trace above.
    
    So fix this by making sure we delete the readahead extent from the radix
    tree if we fail to setup zones for it (when 'have_zone = 0').

    btrfs: cleanup cow block on error
    
    commit 572c83acdcdafeb04e70aa46be1fa539310be20c upstream.
    
    In fstest btrfs/064 a transaction abort in __btrfs_cow_block could lead
    to a system lockup. It gets stuck trying to write back inodes, and the
    write back thread was trying to lock an extent buffer:

    This is because we got an error while COWing a block, specifically here

                    ret = btrfs_reloc_cow_block(trans, root, buf, cow);

    The problem here is that as soon as we allocate the new block it is
    locked and marked dirty in the btree inode.  This means that we could
    attempt to writeback this block and need to lock the extent buffer.
    However we're not unlocking it here and thus we deadlock.
    
    Fix this by unlocking the cow block if we have any errors inside of
    __btrfs_cow_block, and also free it so we do not leak it.

    btrfs: use kvzalloc() to allocate clone_roots in btrfs_ioctl_send()
    
    commit 8eb2fd00153a3a96a19c62ac9c6d48c2efebe5e8 upstream.
    
    btrfs_ioctl_send() used open-coded kvzalloc implementation earlier.
    The code was accidentally replaced with kzalloc() call [1]. Restore
    the original code by using kvzalloc() to allocate sctx->clone_roots.

    btrfs: send, recompute reference path after orphanization of a directory
    
    commit 9c2b4e0347067396ceb3ae929d6888c81d610259 upstream.
    
    During an incremental send, when an inode has multiple new references we
    might end up emitting rename operations for orphanizations that have a
    source path that is no longer valid due to a previous orphanization of
    some directory inode. This causes the receiver to fail since it tries
    to rename a path that does not exists.
    
    Example reproducer:
    
      $ cat reproducer.sh
      #!/bin/bash
    
      mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdi >/dev/null
      mount /dev/sdi /mnt/sdi
    
      touch /mnt/sdi/f1
      touch /mnt/sdi/f2
      mkdir /mnt/sdi/d1
      mkdir /mnt/sdi/d1/d2
    
      # Filesystem looks like:

      # |----- f2                   (ino 258)
      # |----- d1/                  (ino 259)
      #        |----- d2/           (ino 260)
    
      btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt/sdi /mnt/sdi/snap1
      btrfs send -f /tmp/snap1.send /mnt/sdi/snap1
    
      # Now do a series of changes such that:
      #
      # *) inode 258 has one new hardlink and the previous name changed
      #
      # *) both names conflict with the old names of two other inodes:
      #
      #    1) the new name "d1" conflicts with the old name of inode 259,
      #       under directory inode 256 (root)
      #
      #    2) the new name "d2" conflicts with the old name of inode 260
      #       under directory inode 259
      #
      # *) inodes 259 and 260 now have the old names of inode 258
      #
      # *) inode 257 is now located under inode 260 - an inode with a number
      #    smaller than the inode (258) for which we created a second hard
      #    link and swapped its names with inodes 259 and 260
      #

      At subvol snap1
      At snapshot snap2
      ERROR: rename d1/d2 -> o260-6-0 failed: No such file or directory
    
    This happens because:
    
    1) When processing inode 257 we end up computing the name for inode 259
       because it is an ancestor in the send snapshot, and at that point it
       still has its old name, "d1", from the parent snapshot because inode
       259 was not yet processed. We then cache that name, which is valid
       until we start processing inode 259 (or set the progress to 260 after
       processing its references);
    
    2) Later we start processing inode 258 and collecting all its new
       references into the list sctx->new_refs. The first reference in the
       list happens to be the reference for name "d1" while the reference for
       name "d2" is next (the last element of the list).
       We compute the full path "d1/d2" for this second reference and store
       it in the reference (its ->full_path member). The path used for the
       new parent directory was "d1" and not "f2" because inode 259, the
       new parent, was not yet processed;
    
    3) When we start processing the new references at process_recorded_refs()
       we start with the first reference in the list, for the new name "d1".
       Because there is a conflicting inode that was not yet processed, which
       is directory inode 259, we orphanize it, renaming it from "d1" to
       "o259-6-0";
    
    4) Then we start processing the new reference for name "d2", and we
       realize it conflicts with the reference of inode 260 in the parent
       snapshot. So we issue an orphanization operation for inode 260 by
       emitting a rename operation with a destination path of "o260-6-0"
       and a source path of "d1/d2" - this source path is the value we
       stored in the reference earlier at step 2), corresponding to the
       ->full_path member of the reference, however that path is no longer
       valid due to the orphanization of the directory inode 259 in step 3).
       This makes the receiver fail since the path does not exists, it should
       have been "o259-6-0/d2".
    
    Fix this by recomputing the full path of a reference before emitting an
    orphanization if we previously orphanized any directory, since that
    directory could be a parent in the new path. This is a rare scenario so
    keeping it simple and not checking if that previously orphanized directory
    is in fact an ancestor of the inode we are trying to orphanize.
    
    A test case for fstests follows soon.

    btrfs: reschedule if necessary when logging directory items
    
    commit bb56f02f26fe23798edb1b2175707419b28c752a upstream.
    
    Logging directories with many entries can take a significant amount of
    time, and in some cases monopolize a cpu/core for a long time if the
    logging task doesn't happen to block often enough.
    
    Johannes and Lu Fengqi reported test case generic/041 triggering a soft
    lockup when the kernel has CONFIG_SOFTLOCKUP_DETECTOR=y. For this test
    case we log an inode with 3002 hard links, and because the test removed
    one hard link before fsyncing the file, the inode logging causes the
    parent directory do be logged as well, which has 6004 directory items to
    log (3002 BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY items plus 3002 BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY items),
    so it can take a significant amount of time and trigger the soft lockup.
    
    So just make tree-log.c:log_dir_items() reschedule when necessary,
    releasing the current search path before doing so and then resume from
    where it was before the reschedule.
    
    The stack trace produced when the soft lockup happens is the following:

    btrfs: improve device scanning messages
    
    commit 79dae17d8d44b2d15779e332180080af45df5352 upstream.
    
    Systems booting without the initramfs seems to scan an unusual kind
    of device path (/dev/root). And at a later time, the device is updated
    to the correct path. We generally print the process name and PID of the
    process scanning the device but we don't capture the same information if
    the device path is rescanned with a different pathname.
    
    The current message is too long, so drop the unnecessary UUID and add
    process name and PID.
    
    While at this also update the duplicate device warning to include the
    process name and PID so the messages are consistent

    btrfs: qgroup: fix wrong qgroup metadata reserve for delayed inode
    
    commit b4c5d8fdfff3e2b6c4fa4a5043e8946dff500f8c upstream.
    
    For delayed inode facility, qgroup metadata is reserved for it, and
    later freed.
    
    However we're freeing more bytes than we reserved.
    In btrfs_delayed_inode_reserve_metadata():
    
            num_bytes = btrfs_calc_metadata_size(fs_info, 1);
            ...
                    ret = btrfs_qgroup_reserve_meta_prealloc(root,
                                    fs_info->nodesize, true);
                    ...
                    if (!ret) {
                            node->bytes_reserved = num_bytes;
    
    But in btrfs_delayed_inode_release_metadata():
    
            if (qgroup_free)
                    btrfs_qgroup_free_meta_prealloc(node->root,
                                    node->bytes_reserved);
            else
                    btrfs_qgroup_convert_reserved_meta(node->root,
                                    node->bytes_reserved);
    
    This means, we're always releasing more qgroup metadata rsv than we have
    reserved.
    
    This won't trigger selftest warning, as btrfs qgroup metadata rsv has
    extra protection against cases like quota enabled half-way.
    
    But we still need to fix this problem any way.
    
    This patch will use the same num_bytes for qgroup metadata rsv so we
    could handle it correctly.

    w1: mxc_w1: Fix timeout resolution problem leading to bus error
    
    commit c9723750a699c3bd465493ac2be8992b72ccb105 upstream.
    
    On my platform (i.MX53) bus access sometimes fails with
            w1_search: max_slave_count 64 reached, will continue next search.
    
    The reason is the use of jiffies to implement a 200us timeout in
    mxc_w1_ds2_touch_bit().
    On some platforms the jiffies timer resolution is insufficient for this.
    
    Fix by replacing jiffies by ktime_get().
    
    For consistency apply the same change to the other use of jiffies in
    mxc_w1_ds2_reset_bus().

    acpi-cpufreq: Honor _PSD table setting on new AMD CPUs
    
    commit 5368512abe08a28525d9b24abbfc2a72493e8dba upstream.
    
    acpi-cpufreq has a old quirk that overrides the _PSD table supplied by
    BIOS on AMD CPUs. However the _PSD table of new AMD CPUs (Family 19h+)
    now accurately reports the P-state dependency of CPU cores. Hence this
    quirk needs to be fixed in order to support new CPUs' frequency control.

    ACPI: button: fix handling lid state changes when input device closed
    
    commit 21988a8e51479ceffe7b0568b170effabb708dfe upstream.
    
    The original intent of 84d3f6b76447 was to delay evaluating lid state until
    all drivers have been loaded, with input device being opened from userspace
    serving as a signal for this condition. Let's ensure that state updates
    happen even if userspace closed (or in the future inhibited) input device.
    
    Note that if we go through suspend/resume cycle we assume the system has
    been fully initialized even if LID input device has not been opened yet.
    
    This has a side-effect of fixing access to input->users outside of
    input->mutex protections by the way of eliminating said accesses and using
    driver private flag.

    fs: Don't invalidate page buffers in block_write_full_page()
    
    commit 6dbf7bb555981fb5faf7b691e8f6169fc2b2e63b upstream.
    
    If block_write_full_page() is called for a page that is beyond current
    inode size, it will truncate page buffers for the page and return 0.
    This logic has been added in 2.5.62 in commit 81eb69062588 ("fix ext3
    BUG due to race with truncate") in history.git tree to fix a problem
    with ext3 in data=ordered mode. This particular problem doesn't exist
    anymore because ext3 is long gone and ext4 handles ordered data
    differently. Also normally buffers are invalidated by truncate code and
    there's no need to specially handle this in ->writepage() code.
    
    This invalidation of page buffers in block_write_full_page() is causing
    issues to filesystems (e.g. ext4 or ocfs2) when block device is shrunk
    under filesystem's hands and metadata buffers get discarded while being
    tracked by the journalling layer. Although it is obviously "not
    supported" it can cause kernel crashes like:

    which is not great. The crash happens because bh->b_private is suddently
    NULL although BH_JBD flag is still set (this is because
    block_invalidatepage() cleared BH_Mapped flag and subsequent bh lookup
    found buffer without BH_Mapped set, called init_page_buffers() which has
    rewritten bh->b_private). So just remove the invalidation in
    block_write_full_page().
    
    Note that the buffer cache invalidation when block device changes size
    is already careful to avoid similar problems by using
    invalidate_mapping_pages() which skips busy buffers so it was only this
    odd block_write_full_page() behavior that could tear down bdev buffers
    under filesystem's hands.

    media: uvcvideo: Fix uvc_ctrl_fixup_xu_info() not having any effect
    
    commit 93df48d37c3f03886d84831992926333e7810640 upstream.
    
    uvc_ctrl_add_info() calls uvc_ctrl_get_flags() which will override
    the fixed-up flags set by uvc_ctrl_fixup_xu_info().
    
    uvc_ctrl_init_xu_ctrl() already calls uvc_ctrl_get_flags() before
    calling uvc_ctrl_add_info(), so the uvc_ctrl_get_flags() call in
    uvc_ctrl_add_info() is not necessary for xu ctrls.
    
    This commit moves the uvc_ctrl_get_flags() call for normal controls
    from uvc_ctrl_add_info() to uvc_ctrl_init_ctrl(), so that we no longer
    call uvc_ctrl_get_flags() twice for xu controls and so that we no longer
    override the fixed-up flags set by uvc_ctrl_fixup_xu_info().
    
    This fixes the xu motor controls not working properly on a Logitech
    046d:08cc, and presumably also on the other Logitech models which have
    a quirk for this in the uvc_ctrl_fixup_xu_info() function.

    perf/x86/amd/ibs: Fix raw sample data accumulation
    
    commit 36e1be8ada994d509538b3b1d0af8b63c351e729 upstream.
    
    Neither IbsBrTarget nor OPDATA4 are populated in IBS Fetch mode.
    Don't accumulate them into raw sample user data in that case.
    
    Also, in Fetch mode, add saving the IBS Fetch Control Extended MSR.
    
    Technically, there is an ABI change here with respect to the IBS raw
    sample data format, but I don't see any perf driver version information
    being included in perf.data file headers, but, existing users can detect
    whether the size of the sample record has reduced by 8 bytes to
    determine whether the IBS driver has this fix.

    mmc: sdhci-acpi: AMDI0040: Set SDHCI_QUIRK2_PRESET_VALUE_BROKEN
    
    commit f23cc3ba491af77395cea3f9d51204398729f26b upstream.
    
    This change fixes HS400 tuning for devices with invalid presets.
    
    SDHCI presets are not currently used for eMMC HS/HS200/HS400, but are
    used for DDR52. The HS400 retuning sequence is:
    
        HS400->DDR52->HS->HS200->Perform Tuning->HS->HS400
    
    This means that when HS400 tuning happens, we transition through DDR52
    for a very brief period. This causes presets to be enabled
    unintentionally and stay enabled when transitioning back to HS200 or
    HS400. Some firmware has invalid presets, so we end up with driver
    strengths that can cause I/O problems.

    nvme-rdma: fix crash when connect rejected
    
    [ Upstream commit 43efdb8e870ee0f58633fd579aa5b5185bf5d39e ]
    
    A crash can happened when a connect is rejected.   The host establishes
    the connection after received ConnectReply, and then continues to send
    the fabrics Connect command.  If the controller does not receive the
    ReadyToUse capsule, host may receive a ConnectReject reply.
    
    Call nvme_rdma_destroy_queue_ib after the host received the
    RDMA_CM_EVENT_REJECTED event.  Then when the fabrics Connect command
    times out, nvme_rdma_timeout calls nvme_rdma_complete_rq to fail the
    request.  A crash happenes due to use after free in
    nvme_rdma_complete_rq.
    
    nvme_rdma_destroy_queue_ib is redundant when handling the
    RDMA_CM_EVENT_REJECTED event as nvme_rdma_destroy_queue_ib is already
    called in connection failure handler.

    sgl_alloc_order: fix memory leak
    
    [ Upstream commit b2a182a40278bc5849730e66bca01a762188ed86 ]
    
    sgl_alloc_order() can fail when 'length' is large on a memory
    constrained system. When order > 0 it will potentially be
    making several multi-page allocations with the later ones more
    likely to fail than the earlier one. So it is important that
    sgl_alloc_order() frees up any pages it has obtained before
    returning NULL. In the case when order > 0 it calls the wrong
    free page function and leaks. In testing the leak was
    sufficient to bring down my 8 GiB laptop with OOM.

    Callers are generally not supposed to check the return values from

    handling will never trigger.  (Historically debugfs functions used to
    return a mix of NULL and error pointers but it was eventually deemed too
    complicated for something which wasn't intended to be used in normal
    situations).

    ARM: dts: omap4: Fix sgx clock rate for 4430
    
    [ Upstream commit 19d3e9a0bdd57b90175f30390edeb06851f5f9f3 ]
    
    We currently have a different clock rate for droid4 compared to the
    stock v3.0.8 based Android Linux kernel:
    
    # cat /sys/kernel/debug/clk/dpll_*_m7x2_ck/clk_rate
    266666667
    307200000
    # cat /sys/kernel/debug/clk/l3_gfx_cm:clk:0000:0/clk_rate
    307200000
    
    Let's fix this by configuring sgx to use 153.6 MHz instead of 307.2 MHz.
    Looks like also at least duover needs this change to avoid hangs, so
    let's apply it for all 4430.
    
    This helps a bit with thermal issues that seem to be related to memory
    corruption when using sgx. It seems that other driver related issues
    still remain though.

    cifs: handle -EINTR in cifs_setattr
    
    [ Upstream commit c6cc4c5a72505a0ecefc9b413f16bec512f38078 ]
    
    RHBZ: 1848178
    
    Some calls that set attributes, like utimensat(), are not supposed to return
    -EINTR and thus do not have handlers for this in glibc which causes us
    to leak -EINTR to the applications which are also unprepared to handle it.
    
    For example tar will break if utimensat() return -EINTR and abort unpacking
    the archive. Other applications may break too.
    
    To handle this we add checks, and retry, for -EINTR in cifs_setattr()

    gfs2: add validation checks for size of superblock
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ddc5154b24c96f20e94d653b0a814438de6032b ]
    
    In gfs2_check_sb(), no validation checks are performed with regards to
    the size of the superblock.
    syzkaller detected a slab-out-of-bounds bug that was primarily caused
    because the block size for a superblock was set to zero.
    A valid size for a superblock is a power of 2 between 512 and PAGE_SIZE.
    Performing validation checks and ensuring that the size of the superblock
    is valid fixes this bug.

    ext4: Detect already used quota file early
    
    [ Upstream commit e0770e91424f694b461141cbc99adf6b23006b60 ]
    
    When we try to use file already used as a quota file again (for the same
    or different quota type), strange things can happen. At the very least
    lockdep annotations may be wrong but also inode flags may be wrongly set
    / reset. When the file is used for two quota types at once we can even
    corrupt the file and likely crash the kernel. Catch all these cases by
    checking whether passed file is already used as quota file and bail
    early in that case.
    
    This fixes occasional generic/219 failure due to lockdep complaint.

    it will see an uninitialized value of rdc321x_wdt_device.queue,

    Also, rdc321x_wdt_device.default_ticks is accessed in reset()
    function called from write callback, thus initialize it before

    net: 9p: initialize sun_server.sun_path to have addr's value only when addr is valid
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ca1db21ef8e0e6725b4d25deed1ca196f7efb28 ]
    
    In p9_fd_create_unix, checking is performed to see if the addr (passed
    as an argument) is NULL or not.
    However, no check is performed to see if addr is a valid address, i.e.,
    it doesn't entirely consist of only 0's.
    The initialization of sun_server.sun_path to be equal to this faulty
    addr value leads to an uninitialized variable, as detected by KMSAN.
    Checking for this (faulty addr) and returning a negative error number
    appropriately, resolves this issue.

    ```
    
    The minus 1 is wrong, this branch should report 2048 bits of space.
    With "-1" action, this only report 1024 bit of space.
    
    This bug code returns wrong blocks, but it doesn't inflence bitmap logic:
    1. Most callers focus this function return value (the counter of offset),
       not the parameter blocks.
    2. The bug is only triggered when hijacked is true or map is NULL.
       the hijacked true condition is very rare.
       the "map == null" only true when array is creating or resizing.
    3. Even the caller gets wrong blocks, current code makes caller just to
       call md_bitmap_get_counter() one more time.

    btrfs: fix replace of seed device
    
    [ Upstream commit c6a5d954950c5031444173ad2195efc163afcac9 ]
    
    If you replace a seed device in a sprouted fs, it appears to have
    successfully replaced the seed device, but if you look closely, it
    didn't.  Here is an example.
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda
      $ btrfstune -S1 /dev/sda
      $ mount /dev/sda /btrfs
      $ btrfs device add /dev/sdb /btrfs
      $ umount /btrfs
      $ btrfs device scan --forget
      $ mount -o device=/dev/sda /dev/sdb /btrfs
      $ btrfs replace start -f /dev/sda /dev/sdc /btrfs
      $ echo $?
      0
    
      BTRFS info (device sdb): dev_replace from /dev/sda (devid 1) to /dev/sdc started
      BTRFS info (device sdb): dev_replace from /dev/sda (devid 1) to /dev/sdc finished
    
      $ btrfs fi show
      Label: none  uuid: ab2c88b7-be81-4a7e-9849-c3666e7f9f4f
              Total devices 2 FS bytes used 256.00KiB
              devid    1 size 3.00GiB used 520.00MiB path /dev/sdc
              devid    2 size 3.00GiB used 896.00MiB path /dev/sdb
    
      Label: none  uuid: 10bd3202-0415-43af-96a8-d5409f310a7e
              Total devices 1 FS bytes used 128.00KiB
              devid    1 size 3.00GiB used 536.00MiB path /dev/sda
    
    So as per the replace start command and kernel log replace was successful.
    Now let's try to clean mount.
    
      $ umount /btrfs
      $ btrfs device scan --forget
    
      $ mount -o device=/dev/sdc /dev/sdb /btrfs
      mount: /btrfs: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.
    
      [  636.157517] BTRFS error (device sdc): failed to read chunk tree: -2
      [  636.180177] BTRFS error (device sdc): open_ctree failed
    
    That's because per dev items it is still looking for the original seed
    device.
    
     $ btrfs inspect-internal dump-tree -d /dev/sdb
    
            item 0 key (DEV_ITEMS DEV_ITEM 1) itemoff 16185 itemsize 98

                    io_align 4096 io_width 4096 sector_size 4096 type 0
                    generation 0 start_offset 0 dev_group 0
                    seek_speed 0 bandwidth 0
                    uuid 56a0a6bc-4630-4998-8daf-3c3030c4256a  <- sprout uuid
                    fsid ab2c88b7-be81-4a7e-9849-c3666e7f9f4f <- sprout fsid
    
    But the replaced target has the following uuid+fsid in its superblock
    which doesn't match with the expected uuid+fsid in its devitem.
    
      $ btrfs in dump-super /dev/sdc | egrep '^generation|dev_item.uuid|dev_item.fsid|devid'
      generation    20
      dev_item.uuid 59368f50-9af2-4b17-91da-8a783cc418d4
      dev_item.fsid ab2c88b7-be81-4a7e-9849-c3666e7f9f4f [match]
      dev_item.devid        1
    
    So if you provide the original seed device the mount shall be
    successful.  Which so long happening in the test case btrfs/163.
    
      $ btrfs device scan --forget
      $ mount -o device=/dev/sda /dev/sdb /btrfs
    
    Fix in this patch:
    If a seed is not sprouted then there is no replacement of it, because of
    its read-only filesystem with a read-only device. Similarly, in the case
    of a sprouted filesystem, the seed device is still read only. So, mark
    it as you can't replace a seed device, you can only add a new device and
    then delete the seed device. If replace is attempted then returns
    -EINVAL.

    drm/amd/display: HDMI remote sink need mode validation for Linux
    
    [ Upstream commit 95d620adb48f7728e67d82f56f756e8d451cf8d2 ]
    
    [Why]
    Currently mode validation is bypassed if remote sink exists. That
    leads to mode set issue when a BW bottle neck exists in the link path,
    e.g., a DP-to-HDMI converter that only supports HDMI 1.4.
    
    Any invalid mode passed to Linux user space will cause the modeset
    failure due to limitation of Linux user space implementation.
    
    [How]
    Mode validation is skipped only if in edid override. For real remote
    sink, clock limit check should be done for HDMI remote sink.
    
    Have HDMI related remote sink going through mode validation to
    elimiate modes which pixel clock exceeds BW limitation.

    drivers/net/wan/hdlc_fr: Correctly handle special skb->protocol values
    
    [ Upstream commit 8306266c1d51aac9aa7aa907fe99032a58c6382c ]
    
    The fr_hard_header function is used to prepend the header to skbs before
    transmission. It is used in 3 situations:
    1) When a control packet is generated internally in this driver;
    2) When a user sends an skb on an Ethernet-emulating PVC device;
    3) When a user sends an skb on a normal PVC device.
    
    These 3 situations need to be handled differently by fr_hard_header.
    Different headers should be prepended to the skb in different situations.
    
    Currently fr_hard_header distinguishes these 3 situations using
    skb->protocol. For situation 1 and 2, a special skb->protocol value
    will be assigned before calling fr_hard_header, so that it can recognize
    these 2 situations. All skb->protocol values other than these special ones
    are treated by fr_hard_header as situation 3.
    
    However, it is possible that in situation 3, the user sends an skb with
    one of the special skb->protocol values. In this case, fr_hard_header
    would incorrectly treat it as situation 1 or 2.
    
    This patch tries to solve this issue by using skb->dev instead of
    skb->protocol to distinguish between these 3 situations. For situation
    1, skb->dev would be NULL; for situation 2, skb->dev->type would be
    ARPHRD_ETHER; and for situation 3, skb->dev->type would be ARPHRD_DLCI.
    
    This way fr_hard_header would be able to distinguish these 3 situations
    correctly regardless what skb->protocol value the user tries to use in
    situation 3.

    ACPI: Add out of bounds and numa_off protections to pxm_to_node()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a3decac087aa897df5af04358c2089e52e70ac4 ]
    
    The function should check the validity of the pxm value before using
    it to index the pxm_to_node_map[] array.
    
    Whilst hardening this code may be good in general, the main intent
    here is to enable following patches that use this function to replace
    acpi_map_pxm_to_node() for non SRAT usecases which should return
    NO_NUMA_NODE for PXM entries not matching with those in SRAT.

    xfs: don't free rt blocks when we're doing a REMAP bunmapi call
    
    [ Upstream commit 8df0fa39bdd86ca81a8d706a6ed9d33cc65ca625 ]
    
    When callers pass XFS_BMAPI_REMAP into xfs_bunmapi, they want the extent
    to be unmapped from the given file fork without the extent being freed.
    We do this for non-rt files, but we forgot to do this for realtime
    files.  So far this isn't a big deal since nobody makes a bunmapi call
    to a rt file with the REMAP flag set, but don't leave a logic bomb.

    return cpu_all_mask just like most other architectures do if passed

    usb: xhci: omit duplicate actions when suspending a runtime suspended host.
    
    [ Upstream commit 18a367e8947d72dd91b6fc401e88a2952c6363f7 ]
    
    If the xhci-plat.c is the platform driver, after the runtime pm is
    enabled, the xhci_suspend is called if nothing is connected on
    the port. When the system goes to suspend, it will call xhci_suspend again
    if USB wakeup is enabled.
    
    Since the runtime suspend wakeup setting is not always the same as
    system suspend wakeup setting, eg, at runtime suspend we always need
    wakeup if the controller is in low power mode; but at system suspend,
    we may not need wakeup. So, we move the judgement after changing
    wakeup setting.

    uio: free uio id after uio file node is freed
    
    [ Upstream commit 8fd0e2a6df262539eaa28b0a2364cca10d1dc662 ]
    
    uio_register_device() do two things.
    1) get an uio id from a global pool, e.g. the id is <A>
    2) create file nodes like /sys/class/uio/uio<A>
    
    uio_unregister_device() do two things.
    1) free the uio id <A> and return it to the global pool
    2) free the file node /sys/class/uio/uio<A>
    
    There is a situation is that one worker is calling uio_unregister_device(),
    and another worker is calling uio_register_device().
    If the two workers are X and Y, they go as below sequence,
    1) X free the uio id <AAA>
    2) Y get an uio id <AAA>
    3) Y create file node /sys/class/uio/uio<AAA>
    4) X free the file note /sys/class/uio/uio<AAA>
    Then it will failed at the 3rd step and cause the phenomenon we saw as it
    is creating a duplicated file node.

    kgdb: Make "kgdbcon" work properly with "kgdb_earlycon"
    
    [ Upstream commit b18b099e04f450cdc77bec72acefcde7042bd1f3 ]
    
    On my system the kernel processes the "kgdb_earlycon" parameter before
    the "kgdbcon" parameter.  When we setup "kgdb_earlycon" we'll end up
    in kgdb_register_callbacks() and "kgdb_use_con" won't have been set
    yet so we'll never get around to starting "kgdbcon".  Let's remedy
    this by detecting that the IO module was already registered when
    setting "kgdb_use_con" and registering the console then.
    
    As part of this, to avoid pre-declaring things, move the handling of
    the "kgdbcon" further down in the file.

    arm64: topology: Stop using MPIDR for topology information
    
    [ Upstream commit 3102bc0e6ac752cc5df896acb557d779af4d82a1 ]
    
    In the absence of ACPI or DT topology data, we fallback to haphazardly
    decoding *something* out of MPIDR. Sadly, the contents of that register are
    mostly unusable due to the implementation leniancy and things like Aff0
    having to be capped to 15 (despite being encoded on 8 bits).
    
    Consider a simple system with a single package of 32 cores, all under the
    same LLC. We ought to be shoving them in the same core_sibling mask, but
    MPIDR is going to look like:
    
      | CPU  | 0 | ... | 15 | 16 | ... | 31 |
      |------+---+-----+----+----+-----+----+
      | Aff0 | 0 | ... | 15 |  0 | ... | 15 |
      | Aff1 | 0 | ... |  0 |  1 | ... |  1 |
      | Aff2 | 0 | ... |  0 |  0 | ... |  0 |
    
    Which will eventually yield
    
      core_sibling(0-15)  == 0-15
      core_sibling(16-31) == 16-31
    
    NUMA woes
    =========
    
    If we try to play games with this and set up NUMA boundaries within those
    groups of 16 cores via e.g. QEMU:
    
      # Node0: 0-9; Node1: 10-19
      $ qemu-system-aarch64 <blah> \
        -smp 20 -numa node,cpus=0-9,nodeid=0 -numa node,cpus=10-19,nodeid=1
    
    The scheduler's MC domain (all CPUs with same LLC) is going to be built via
    
      arch_topology.c::cpu_coregroup_mask()
    
    In there we try to figure out a sensible mask out of the topology
    information we have. In short, here we'll pick the smallest of NUMA or
    core sibling mask.
    
      node_mask(CPU9)    == 0-9
      core_sibling(CPU9) == 0-15
    
    MC mask for CPU9 will thus be 0-9, not a problem.
    
      node_mask(CPU10)    == 10-19
      core_sibling(CPU10) == 0-15
    
    MC mask for CPU10 will thus be 10-19, not a problem.
    
      node_mask(CPU16)    == 10-19
      core_sibling(CPU16) == 16-19
    
    MC mask for CPU16 will thus be 16-19... Uh oh. CPUs 16-19 are in two
    different unique MC spans, and the scheduler has no idea what to make of
    that. That triggers the WARN_ON() added by commit
    
      ccf74128d66c ("sched/topology: Assert non-NUMA topology masks don't (partially) overlap")
    
    Fixing MPIDR-derived topology
    =============================
    
    We could try to come up with some cleverer scheme to figure out which of
    the available masks to pick, but really if one of those masks resulted from
    MPIDR then it should be discarded because it's bound to be bogus.
    
    I was hoping to give MPIDR a chance for SMT, to figure out which threads are
    in the same core using Aff1-3 as core ID, but Sudeep and Robin pointed out
    to me that there are systems out there where *all* cores have non-zero
    values in their higher affinity fields (e.g. RK3288 has "5" in all of its
    cores' MPIDR.Aff1), which would expose a bogus core ID to userspace.
    
    Stop using MPIDR for topology information. When no other source of topology
    information is available, mark each CPU as its own core and its NUMA node
    as its LLC domain.

    usb: typec: tcpm: During PR_SWAP, source caps should be sent only after tSwapSourceStart
    
    [ Upstream commit 6bbe2a90a0bb4af8dd99c3565e907fe9b5e7fd88 ]
    
    The patch addresses the compliance test failures while running
    TD.PD.CP.E3, TD.PD.CP.E4, TD.PD.CP.E5 of the "Deterministic PD
    Compliance MOI" test plan published in https://www.usb.org/usbc.
    For a product to be Type-C compliant, it's expected that these tests
    are run on usb.org certified Type-C compliance tester as mentioned in
    https://www.usb.org/usbc.
    
    The purpose of the tests TD.PD.CP.E3, TD.PD.CP.E4, TD.PD.CP.E5 is to
    verify the PR_SWAP response of the device. While doing so, the test
    asserts that Source Capabilities message is NOT received from the test
    device within tSwapSourceStart min (20 ms) from the time the last bit
    of GoodCRC corresponding to the RS_RDY message sent by the UUT was
    sent. If it does then the test fails.
    
    This is in line with the requirements from the USB Power Delivery
    Specification Revision 3.0, Version 1.2:
    "6.6.8.1 SwapSourceStartTimer
    The SwapSourceStartTimer Shall be used by the new Source, after a
    Power Role Swap or Fast Role Swap, to ensure that it does not send
    Source_Capabilities Message before the new Sink is ready to receive
    the
    Source_Capabilities Message. The new Source Shall Not send the
    Source_Capabilities Message earlier than tSwapSourceStart after the
    last bit of the EOP of GoodCRC Message sent in response to the PS_RDY
    Message sent by the new Source indicating that its power supply is
    ready."
    
    The patch makes sure that TCPM does not send the Source_Capabilities
    Message within tSwapSourceStart(20ms) by transitioning into
    SRC_STARTUP only after  tSwapSourceStart(20ms).

    ath10k: start recovery process when payload length exceeds max htc length for sdio
    
    [ Upstream commit 2fd3c8f34d08af0a6236085f9961866ad92ef9ec ]
    
    When simulate random transfer fail for sdio write and read, it happened
    "payload length exceeds max htc length" and recovery later sometimes.
    
    Test steps:
    1. Add config and update kernel:
    CONFIG_FAIL_MMC_REQUEST=y
    CONFIG_FAULT_INJECTION=y
    CONFIG_FAULT_INJECTION_DEBUG_FS=y
    
    2. Run simulate fail:
    cd /sys/kernel/debug/mmc1/fail_mmc_request
    echo 10 > probability
    echo 10 > times # repeat until hitting issues
    
    3. It happened payload length exceeds max htc length.
    [  199.935506] ath10k_sdio mmc1:0001:1: payload length 57005 exceeds max htc length: 4088
    ....
    [  264.990191] ath10k_sdio mmc1:0001:1: payload length 57005 exceeds max htc length: 4088
    
    4. after some time, such as 60 seconds, it start recovery which triggered
    by wmi command timeout for periodic scan.
    [  269.229232] ieee80211 phy0: Hardware restart was requested
    [  269.734693] ath10k_sdio mmc1:0001:1: device successfully recovered
    
    The simulate fail of sdio is not a real sdio transter fail, it only
    set an error status in mmc_should_fail_request after the transfer end,
    actually the transfer is success, then sdio_io_rw_ext_helper will
    return error status and stop transfer the left data. For example,
    the really RX len is 286 bytes, then it will split to 2 blocks in
    sdio_io_rw_ext_helper, one is 256 bytes, left is 30 bytes, if the
    first 256 bytes get an error status by mmc_should_fail_request,then
    the left 30 bytes will not read in this RX operation. Then when the
    next RX arrive, the left 30 bytes will be considered as the header
    of the read, the top 4 bytes of the 30 bytes will be considered as
    lookaheads, but actually the 4 bytes is not the lookaheads, so the len
    from this lookaheads is not correct, it exceeds max htc length 4088
    sometimes. When happened exceeds, the buffer chain is not matched between
    firmware and ath10k, then it need to start recovery ASAP. Recently then
    recovery will be started by wmi command timeout, but it will be long time
    later, for example, it is 60+ seconds later from the periodic scan, if
    it does not have periodic scan, it will be longer.
    
    Start recovery when it happened "payload length exceeds max htc length"
    will be reasonable.
    
    This patch only effect sdio chips.

    xfs: fix realtime bitmap/summary file truncation when growing rt volume
    
    [ Upstream commit f4c32e87de7d66074d5612567c5eac7325024428 ]
    
    The realtime bitmap and summary files are regular files that are hidden
    away from the directory tree.  Since they're regular files, inode
    inactivation will try to purge what it thinks are speculative
    preallocations beyond the incore size of the file.  Unfortunately,
    xfs_growfs_rt forgets to update the incore size when it resizes the
    inodes, with the result that inactivating the rt inodes at unmount time
    will cause their contents to be truncated.
    
    Fix this by updating the incore size when we change the ondisk size as
    part of updating the superblock.  Note that we don't do this when we're
    allocating blocks to the rt inodes because we actually want those blocks
    to get purged if the growfs fails.
    
    This fixes corruption complaints from the online rtsummary checker when
    running xfs/233.  Since that test requires rmap, one can also trigger
    this by growing an rt volume, cycling the mount, and creating rt files.

    sparc64: remove mm_cpumask clearing to fix kthread_use_mm race
    
    [ Upstream commit bafb056ce27940c9994ea905336aa8f27b4f7275 ]
    
    The de facto (and apparently uncommented) standard for using an mm had,
    thanks to this code in sparc if nothing else, been that you must have a
    reference on mm_users *and that reference must have been obtained with
    mmget()*, i.e., from a thread with a reference to mm_users that had used
    the mm.
    
    The introduction of mmget_not_zero() in commit d2005e3f41d4
    ("userfaultfd: don't pin the user memory in userfaultfd_file_create()")
    allowed mm_count holders to aoperate on user mappings asynchronously
    from the actual threads using the mm, but they were not to load those
    mappings into their TLB (i.e., walking vmas and page tables is okay,
    kthread_use_mm() is not).
    
    io_uring 2b188cc1bb857 ("Add io_uring IO interface") added code which
    does a kthread_use_mm() from a mmget_not_zero() refcount.
    
    The problem with this is code which previously assumed mm == current->mm
    and mm->mm_users == 1 implies the mm will remain single-threaded at
    least until this thread creates another mm_users reference, has now
    broken.
    
    arch/sparc/kernel/smp_64.c:
    
        if (atomic_read(&mm->mm_users) == 1) {
            cpumask_copy(mm_cpumask(mm), cpumask_of(cpu));
            goto local_flush_and_out;
        }
    
    vs fs/io_uring.c
    
        if (unlikely(!(ctx->flags & IORING_SETUP_SQPOLL) ||
                     !mmget_not_zero(ctx->sqo_mm)))
            return -EFAULT;
        kthread_use_mm(ctx->sqo_mm);
    
    mmget_not_zero() could come in right after the mm_users == 1 test, then
    kthread_use_mm() which sets its CPU in the mm_cpumask. That update could
    be lost if cpumask_copy() occurs afterward.
    
    I propose we fix this by allowing mmget_not_zero() to be a first-class
    reference, and not have this obscure undocumented and unchecked
    restriction.
    
    The basic fix for sparc64 is to remove its mm_cpumask clearing code. The
    optimisation could be effectively restored by sending IPIs to mm_cpumask
    members and having them remove themselves from mm_cpumask. This is more
    tricky so I leave it as an exercise for someone with a sparc64 SMP.
    powerpc has a (currently similarly broken) example.

    mm: fix exec activate_mm vs TLB shootdown and lazy tlb switching race
    
    commit d53c3dfb23c45f7d4f910c3a3ca84bf0a99c6143 upstream.
    
    Reading and modifying current->mm and current->active_mm and switching
    mm should be done with irqs off, to prevent races seeing an intermediate
    state.
    
    This is similar to commit 38cf307c1f20 ("mm: fix kthread_use_mm() vs TLB
    invalidate"). At exec-time when the new mm is activated, the old one
    should usually be single-threaded and no longer used, unless something
    else is holding an mm_users reference (which may be possible).
    
    Absent other mm_users, there is also a race with preemption and lazy tlb
    switching. Consider the kernel_execve case where the current thread is
    using a lazy tlb active mm:
    
      call_usermodehelper()
        kernel_execve()
          old_mm = current->mm;
          active_mm = current->active_mm;
          *** preempt *** -------------------->  schedule()
                                                   prev->active_mm = NULL;
                                                   mmdrop(prev active_mm);
                                                 ...
                          <--------------------  schedule()
          current->mm = mm;
          current->active_mm = mm;
          if (!old_mm)
              mmdrop(active_mm);
    
    If we switch back to the kernel thread from a different mm, there is a
    double free of the old active_mm, and a missing free of the new one.
    
    Closing this race only requires interrupts to be disabled while ->mm
    and ->active_mm are being switched, but the TLB problem requires also
    holding interrupts off over activate_mm. Unfortunately not all archs
    can do that yet, e.g., arm defers the switch if irqs are disabled and
    expects finish_arch_post_lock_switch() to be called to complete the
    flush; um takes a blocking lock in activate_mm().
    
    So as a first step, disable interrupts across the mm/active_mm updates
    to close the lazy tlb preempt race, and provide an arch option to
    extend that to activate_mm which allows architectures doing IPI based
    TLB shootdowns to close the second race.
    
    This is a bit ugly, but in the interest of fixing the bug and backporting
    before all architectures are converted this is a compromise.

    When building with W=1 we get the following warning:

    When building with DEBUG undefined DBG() expands to nothing and GCC emits
    the warning due to the lack of braces around an empty statement.

    If should_futex_fail() returns true in futex_wake_pi(), then the 'ret'
    variable is set to -EFAULT and then immediately overwritten. So the failure
    injection is non-functional.
    
    Fix it by actually leaving the function and returning -EFAULT.
    
    The Fixes tag is kinda blury because the initial commit which introduced
    failure injection was already sloppy, but the below mentioned commit broke
    it completely.

    mlxsw: core: Fix use-after-free in mlxsw_emad_trans_finish()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0daf2bf5a2dcf33d446b76360908f109816e2e21 ]
    
    Each EMAD transaction stores the skb used to issue the EMAD request
    ('trans->tx_skb') so that the request could be retried in case of a
    timeout. The skb can be freed when a corresponding response is received
    or as part of the retry logic (e.g., failed retransmit, exceeded maximum
    number of retries).
    
    The two tasks (i.e., response processing and retransmits) are
    synchronized by the atomic 'trans->active' field which ensures that
    responses to inactive transactions are ignored.
    
    In case of a failed retransmit the transaction is finished and all of
    its resources are freed. However, the current code does not mark it as
    inactive. Syzkaller was able to hit a race condition in which a
    concurrent response is processed while the transaction's resources are
    being freed, resulting in a use-after-free [1].
    
    Fix the issue by making sure to mark the transaction as inactive after a
    failed retransmit and free its resources only if a concurrent task did
    not already do that.

    x86/unwind/orc: Fix inactive tasks with stack pointer in %sp on GCC 10 compiled kernels
    
    [ Upstream commit f2ac57a4c49d40409c21c82d23b5706df9b438af ]
    
    GCC 10 optimizes the scheduler code differently than its predecessors.
    
    When CONFIG_DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH=y, the Makefile forces GCC not
    to inline some functions (-fno-inline-functions-called-once). Before GCC
    10, "no-inlined" __schedule() starts with the usual prologue:
    
      push %bp
      mov %sp, %bp
    
    So the ORC unwinder simply picks stack pointer from %bp and
    unwinds from __schedule() just perfectly:
    
      $ cat /proc/1/stack
      [<0>] ep_poll+0x3e9/0x450
      [<0>] do_epoll_wait+0xaa/0xc0
      [<0>] __x64_sys_epoll_wait+0x1a/0x20
      [<0>] do_syscall_64+0x33/0x40
      [<0>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9
    
    But now, with GCC 10, there is no %bp prologue in __schedule():
    
      $ cat /proc/1/stack
      <nothing>
    
    The ORC entry of the point in __schedule() is:
    
      sp:sp+88 bp:last_sp-48 type:call end:0
    
    In this case, nobody subtracts sizeof "struct inactive_task_frame" in
    __unwind_start(). The struct is put on the stack by __switch_to_asm() and
    only then __switch_to_asm() stores %sp to task->thread.sp. But we start
    unwinding from a point in __schedule() (stored in frame->ret_addr by
    'call') and not in __switch_to_asm().
    
    So for these example values in __unwind_start():
    
      sp=ffff94b50001fdc8 bp=ffff8e1f41d29340 ip=__schedule+0x1f0
    
    The stack is:
    
      ffff94b50001fdc8: ffff8e1f41578000 # struct inactive_task_frame
      ffff94b50001fdd0: 0000000000000000
      ffff94b50001fdd8: ffff8e1f41d29340
      ffff94b50001fde0: ffff8e1f41611d40 # ...
      ffff94b50001fde8: ffffffff93c41920 # bx
      ffff94b50001fdf0: ffff8e1f41d29340 # bp
      ffff94b50001fdf8: ffffffff9376cad0 # ret_addr (and end of the struct)
    
    0xffffffff9376cad0 is __schedule+0x1f0 (after the call to
    __switch_to_asm).  Now follow those 88 bytes from the ORC entry (sp+88).
    The entry is correct, __schedule() really pushes 48 bytes (8*7) + 32 bytes
    via subq to store some local values (like 4U below). So to unwind, look
    at the offset 88-sizeof(long) = 0x50 from here:
    
      ffff94b50001fe00: ffff8e1f41578618
      ffff94b50001fe08: 00000cc000000255
      ffff94b50001fe10: 0000000500000004
      ffff94b50001fe18: 7793fab6956b2d00 # NOTE (see below)
      ffff94b50001fe20: ffff8e1f41578000
      ffff94b50001fe28: ffff8e1f41578000
      ffff94b50001fe30: ffff8e1f41578000
      ffff94b50001fe38: ffff8e1f41578000
      ffff94b50001fe40: ffff94b50001fed8
      ffff94b50001fe48: ffff8e1f41577ff0
      ffff94b50001fe50: ffffffff9376cf12
    
    Here                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ is the correct ret addr from
    __schedule(). It translates to schedule+0x42 (insn after a call to
    __schedule()).
    
    BUT, unwind_next_frame() tries to take the address starting from
    0xffff94b50001fdc8. That is exactly from thread.sp+88-sizeof(long) =
    0xffff94b50001fdc8+88-8 = 0xffff94b50001fe18, which is garbage marked as
    NOTE above. So this quits the unwinding as 7793fab6956b2d00 is obviously
    not a kernel address.
    
    There was a fix to skip 'struct inactive_task_frame' in
    unwind_get_return_address_ptr in the following commit:
    
      187b96db5ca7 ("x86/unwind/orc: Fix unwind_get_return_address_ptr() for inactive tasks")
    
    But we need to skip the struct already in the unwinder proper. So
    subtract the size (increase the stack pointer) of the structure in
    __unwind_start() directly. This allows for removal of the code added by
    commit 187b96db5ca7 completely, as the address is now at
    '(unsigned long *)state->sp - 1', the same as in the generic case.
    
    [ mingo: Cleaned up the changelog a bit, for better readability. ]

    xen/events: block rogue events for some time
    
    commit 5f7f77400ab5b357b5fdb7122c3442239672186c upstream.
    
    In order to avoid high dom0 load due to rogue guests sending events at
    high frequency, block those events in case there was no action needed
    in dom0 to handle the events.
    
    This is done by adding a per-event counter, which set to zero in case
    an EOI without the XEN_EOI_FLAG_SPURIOUS is received from a backend
    driver, and incremented when this flag has been set. In case the
    counter is 2 or higher delay the EOI by 1 << (cnt - 2) jiffies, but
    not more than 1 second.
    
    In order not to waste memory shorten the per-event refcnt to two bytes
    (it should normally never exceed a value of 2). Add an overflow check
    to evtchn_get() to make sure the 2 bytes really won't overflow.
    
    This is part of XSA-332.

    xen/events: defer eoi in case of excessive number of events
    
    commit e99502f76271d6bc4e374fe368c50c67a1fd3070 upstream.
    
    In case rogue guests are sending events at high frequency it might
    happen that xen_evtchn_do_upcall() won't stop processing events in
    dom0. As this is done in irq handling a crash might be the result.
    
    In order to avoid that, delay further inter-domain events after some
    time in xen_evtchn_do_upcall() by forcing eoi processing into a
    worker on the same cpu, thus inhibiting new events coming in.
    
    The time after which eoi processing is to be delayed is configurable
    via a new module parameter "event_loop_timeout" which specifies the
    maximum event loop time in jiffies (default: 2, the value was chosen
    after some tests showing that a value of 2 was the lowest with an
    only slight drop of dom0 network throughput while multiple guests
    performed an event storm).
    
    How long eoi processing will be delayed can be specified via another
    parameter "event_eoi_delay" (again in jiffies, default 10, again the
    value was chosen after testing with different delay values).
    
    This is part of XSA-332.

    xen/events: use a common cpu hotplug hook for event channels
    
    commit 7beb290caa2adb0a399e735a1e175db9aae0523a upstream.
    
    Today only fifo event channels have a cpu hotplug callback. In order
    to prepare for more percpu (de)init work move that callback into
    events_base.c and add percpu_init() and percpu_deinit() hooks to
    struct evtchn_ops.

    xen/pciback: use lateeoi irq binding
    
    commit c2711441bc961b37bba0615dd7135857d189035f upstream.
    
    In order to reduce the chance for the system becoming unresponsive due
    to event storms triggered by a misbehaving pcifront use the lateeoi irq
    binding for pciback and unmask the event channel only just before
    leaving the event handling function.
    
    Restructure the handling to support that scheme. Basically an event can
    come in for two reasons: either a normal request for a pciback action,
    which is handled in a worker, or in case the guest has finished an AER
    request which was requested by pciback.
    
    When an AER request is issued to the guest and a normal pciback action
    is currently active issue an EOI early in order to be able to receive
    another event when the AER request has been finished by the guest.
    
    Let the worker processing the normal requests run until no further
    request is pending, instead of starting a new worker ion that case.
    Issue the EOI only just before leaving the worker.
    
    This scheme allows to drop calling the generic function
    xen_pcibk_test_and_schedule_op() after processing of any request as
    the handling of both request types is now separated more cleanly.
    
    This is part of XSA-332.

    further data is found on the ring page to be processed.

    xen/scsiback: use lateeoi irq binding
    
    commit 86991b6e7ea6c613b7692f65106076943449b6b7 upstream.
    
    In order to reduce the chance for the system becoming unresponsive due
    to event storms triggered by a misbehaving scsifront use the lateeoi
    irq binding for scsiback and unmask the event channel only just before
    leaving the event handling function.
    
    In case of a ring protocol error don't issue an EOI in order to avoid
    the possibility to use that for producing an event storm. This at once
    will result in no further call of scsiback_irq_fn(), so the ring_error
    struct member can be dropped and scsiback_do_cmd_fn() can signal the
    protocol error via a negative return value.

    xen/events: add a new "late EOI" evtchn framework
    
    commit 54c9de89895e0a36047fcc4ae754ea5b8655fb9d upstream.
    
    In order to avoid tight event channel related IRQ loops add a new
    framework of "late EOI" handling: the IRQ the event channel is bound
    to will be masked until the event has been handled and the related
    driver is capable to handle another event. The driver is responsible
    for unmasking the event channel via the new function xen_irq_lateeoi().
    
    This is similar to binding an event channel to a threaded IRQ, but
    without having to structure the driver accordingly.
    
    In order to support a future special handling in case a rogue guest
    is sending lots of unsolicited events, add a flag to xen_irq_lateeoi()
    which can be set by the caller to indicate the event was a spurious
    one.
    
    This is part of XSA-332.

    xen/events: add a proper barrier to 2-level uevent unmasking
    
    commit 4d3fe31bd993ef504350989786858aefdb877daa upstream.
    
    A follow-up patch will require certain write to happen before an event
    channel is unmasked.
    
    While the memory barrier is not strictly necessary for all the callers,
    the main one will need it. In order to avoid an extra memory barrier
    when using fifo event channels, mandate evtchn_unmask() to provide
    write ordering.
    
    The 2-level event handling unmask operation is missing an appropriate
    barrier, so add it. Fifo event channels are fine in this regard due to
    using sync_cmpxchg().

    xen/events: avoid removing an event channel while handling it
    
    commit 073d0552ead5bfc7a3a9c01de590e924f11b5dd2 upstream.
    
    Today it can happen that an event channel is being removed from the
    system while the event handling loop is active. This can lead to a
    race resulting in crashes or WARN() splats when trying to access the
    irq_info structure related to the event channel.
    
    Fix this problem by using a rwlock taken as reader in the event
    handling loop and as writer when deallocating the irq_info structure.
    
    As the observed problem was a NULL dereference in evtchn_from_irq()
    make this function more robust against races by testing the irq_info
    pointer to be not NULL before dereferencing it.
    
    And finally make all accesses to evtchn_to_irq[row][col] atomic ones
    in order to avoid seeing partial updates of an array element in irq
    handling. Note that irq handling can be entered only for event channels
    which have been valid before, so any not populated row isn't a problem
    in this regard, as rows are only ever added and never removed.
    
    This is XSA-331.

    Xen is using the chip_data pointer for storing IRQ specific data. When

    those might use chip_data for their own purposes.
    
    Use a local array for this purpose in case of legacy IRQs, avoiding the

    fscrypt: fix race where ->lookup() marks plaintext dentry as ciphertext
    
    commit b01531db6cec2aa330dbc91bfbfaaef4a0d387a4 upstream.
    
    ->lookup() in an encrypted directory begins as follows:
    
    1. fscrypt_prepare_lookup():
        a. Try to load the directory's encryption key.
        b. If the key is unavailable, mark the dentry as a ciphertext name
           via d_flags.
    2. fscrypt_setup_filename():
        a. Try to load the directory's encryption key.
        b. If the key is available, encrypt the name (treated as a plaintext
           name) to get the on-disk name.  Otherwise decode the name
           (treated as a ciphertext name) to get the on-disk name.
    
    But if the key is concurrently added, it may be found at (2a) but not at
    (1a).  In this case, the dentry will be wrongly marked as a ciphertext
    name even though it was actually treated as plaintext.
    
    This will cause the dentry to be wrongly invalidated on the next lookup,
    potentially causing problems.  For example, if the racy ->lookup() was
    part of sys_mount(), then the new mount will be detached when anything
    tries to access it.  This is despite the mountpoint having a plaintext
    path, which should remain valid now that the key was added.
    
    Of course, this is only possible if there's a userspace race.  Still,
    the additional kernel-side race is confusing and unexpected.
    
    Close the kernel-side race by changing fscrypt_prepare_lookup() to also
    set the on-disk filename (step 2b), consistent with the d_flags update.

    fscrypt: only set dentry_operations on ciphertext dentries
    
    commit d456a33f041af4b54f3ce495a86d00c246165032 upstream.
    
    Plaintext dentries are always valid, so only set fscrypt_d_ops on
    ciphertext dentries.
    
    Besides marginally improved performance, this allows overlayfs to use an
    fscrypt-encrypted upperdir, provided that all the following are true:
    
        (1) The fscrypt encryption key is placed in the keyring before
            mounting overlayfs, and remains while the overlayfs is mounted.
    
        (2) The overlayfs workdir uses the same encryption policy.
    
        (3) No dentries for the ciphertext names of subdirectories have been
            created in the upperdir or workdir yet.  (Since otherwise
            d_splice_alias() will reuse the old dentry with ->d_op set.)
    
    One potential use case is using an ephemeral encryption key to encrypt
    all files created or changed by a container, so that they can be
    securely erased ("crypto-shredded") after the container stops.

    fs, fscrypt: clear DCACHE_ENCRYPTED_NAME when unaliasing directory
    
    commit 0bf3d5c1604ecbbd4e49e9f5b3c79152b87adb0d upstream.
    
    Make __d_move() clear DCACHE_ENCRYPTED_NAME on the source dentry.  This
    is needed for when d_splice_alias() moves a directory's encrypted alias
    to its decrypted alias as a result of the encryption key being added.
    
    Otherwise, the decrypted alias will incorrectly be invalidated on the
    next lookup, causing problems such as unmounting a mount the user just
    mount()ed there.
    
    Note that we don't have to support arbitrary moves of this flag because
    fscrypt doesn't allow dentries with DCACHE_ENCRYPTED_NAME to be the
    source or target of a rename().

    fscrypt: fix race allowing rename() and link() of ciphertext dentries
    
    commit 968dd6d0c6d6b6a989c6ddb9e2584a031b83e7b5 upstream.
    
    Close some race conditions where fscrypt allowed rename() and link() on
    ciphertext dentries that had been looked up just prior to the key being
    concurrently added.  It's better to return -ENOKEY in this case.
    
    This avoids doing the nonsensical thing of encrypting the names a second
    time when searching for the actual on-disk dir entries.  It also
    guarantees that DCACHE_ENCRYPTED_NAME dentries are never rename()d, so
    the dcache won't have support all possible combinations of moving
    DCACHE_ENCRYPTED_NAME around during __d_move().

    fscrypt: clean up and improve dentry revalidation
    
    commit 6cc248684d3d23bbd073ae2fa73d3416c0558909 upstream.
    
    Make various improvements to fscrypt dentry revalidation:
    
    - Don't try to handle the case where the per-directory key is removed,
      as this can't happen without the inode (and dentries) being evicted.
    
    - Flag ciphertext dentries rather than plaintext dentries, since it's
      ciphertext dentries that need the special handling.
    
    - Avoid doing unnecessary work for non-ciphertext dentries.
    
    - When revalidating ciphertext dentries, try to set up the directory's
      i_crypt_info to make sure the key is really still absent, rather than
      invalidating all negative dentries as the previous code did.  An old
      comment suggested we can't do this for locking reasons, but AFAICT
      this comment was outdated and it actually works fine.

    fscrypt: return -EXDEV for incompatible rename or link into encrypted dir
    
    commit f5e55e777cc93eae1416f0fa4908e8846b6d7825 upstream.
    
    Currently, trying to rename or link a regular file, directory, or
    symlink into an encrypted directory fails with EPERM when the source
    file is unencrypted or is encrypted with a different encryption policy,
    and is on the same mountpoint.  It is correct for the operation to fail,
    but the choice of EPERM breaks tools like 'mv' that know to copy rather
    than rename if they see EXDEV, but don't know what to do with EPERM.
    
    Our original motivation for EPERM was to encourage users to securely
    handle their data.  Encrypting files by "moving" them into an encrypted
    directory can be insecure because the unencrypted data may remain in
    free space on disk, where it can later be recovered by an attacker.
    It's much better to encrypt the data from the start, or at least try to
    securely delete the source data e.g. using the 'shred' program.
    
    However, the current behavior hasn't been effective at achieving its
    goal because users tend to be confused, hack around it, and complain;
    see e.g. https://github.com/google/fscrypt/issues/76.  And in some cases
    it's actually inconsistent or unnecessary.  For example, 'mv'-ing files
    between differently encrypted directories doesn't work even in cases
    where it can be secure, such as when in userspace the same passphrase
    protects both directories.  Yet, you *can* already 'mv' unencrypted
    files into an encrypted directory if the source files are on a different
    mountpoint, even though doing so is often insecure.
    
    There are probably better ways to teach users to securely handle their
    files.  For example, the 'fscrypt' userspace tool could provide a
    command that migrates unencrypted files into an encrypted directory,
    acting like 'shred' on the source files and providing appropriate
    warnings depending on the type of the source filesystem and disk.
    
    Receiving errors on unimportant files might also force some users to
    disable encryption, thus making the behavior counterproductive.  It's
    desirable to make encryption as unobtrusive as possible.
    
    Therefore, change the error code from EPERM to EXDEV so that tools
    looking for EXDEV will fall back to a copy.
    
    This, of course, doesn't prevent users from still doing the right things
    to securely manage their files.  Note that this also matches the
    behavior when a file is renamed between two project quota hierarchies;
    so there's precedent for using EXDEV for things other than mountpoints.
    
    xfstests generic/398 will require an update with this change.

    ata: sata_rcar: Fix DMA boundary mask
    
    commit df9c590986fdb6db9d5636d6cd93bc919c01b451 upstream.
    
    Before commit 9495b7e92f716ab2 ("driver core: platform: Initialize
    dma_parms for platform devices"), the R-Car SATA device didn't have DMA
    parameters.  Hence the DMA boundary mask supplied by its driver was
    silently ignored, as __scsi_init_queue() doesn't check the return value
    of dma_set_seg_boundary(), and the default value of 0xffffffff was used.
    
    Now the device has gained DMA parameters, the driver-supplied value is
    used, and the following warning is printed on Salvator-XS:
    
        DMA-API: sata_rcar ee300000.sata: mapping sg segment across boundary [start=0x00000000ffffe000] [end=0x00000000ffffefff] [boundary=0x000000001ffffffe]
        WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 38 at kernel/dma/debug.c:1233 debug_dma_map_sg+0x298/0x300
    
    (the range of start/end values depend on whether IOMMU support is
     enabled or not)
    
    The issue here is that SATA_RCAR_DMA_BOUNDARY doesn't have bit 0 set, so
    any typical end value, which is odd, will trigger the check.
    
    Fix this by increasing the DMA boundary value by 1.
    
    This also fixes the following WRITE DMA EXT timeout issue:
    
        # dd if=/dev/urandom of=/mnt/de1/file1-1024M bs=1M count=1024
        ata1.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x6 frozen

    serial: pl011: Fix lockdep splat when handling magic-sysrq interrupt
    
    commit 534cf755d9df99e214ddbe26b91cd4d81d2603e2 upstream.
    
    Issuing a magic-sysrq via the PL011 causes the following lockdep splat,
    which is easily reproducible under QEMU:
    
      | sysrq: Changing Loglevel
      | sysrq: Loglevel set to 9
      |
      | ======================================================
      | WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected
      | 5.9.0-rc7 #1 Not tainted
      | ------------------------------------------------------
      | systemd-journal/138 is trying to acquire lock:
      | ffffab133ad950c0 (console_owner){-.-.}-{0:0}, at: console_lock_spinning_enable+0x34/0x70
      |
      | but task is already holding lock:
      | ffff0001fd47b098 (&port_lock_key){-.-.}-{2:2}, at: pl011_int+0x40/0x488
      |
      | which lock already depends on the new lock.
    
      [...]
    
      |  Possible unsafe locking scenario:
      |
      |        CPU0                    CPU1
      |        ----                    ----
      |   lock(&port_lock_key);
      |                                lock(console_owner);
      |                                lock(&port_lock_key);
      |   lock(console_owner);
      |
      |  *** DEADLOCK ***
    
    The issue being that CPU0 takes 'port_lock' on the irq path in pl011_int()
    before taking 'console_owner' on the printk() path, whereas CPU1 takes
    the two locks in the opposite order on the printk() path due to setting
    the "console_owner" prior to calling into into the actual console driver.
    
    Fix this in the same way as the msm-serial driver by dropping 'port_lock'
    before handling the sysrq.

                         req->callback = NULL
                         spin_lock_bh()
                           if (!list_empty(&req->list))
                             // Skipped!
                             // cancel_delayed_work(&req->work);
                         spin_unlock_bh()
    
                        process_one_req() // again
                         req->callback() // BOOM
                                                    cancel_delayed_work_sync()
    
    The solution is to always cancel the work once it is completed so any
    in between set_timeout() does not result in it running again.

    p54: avoid accessing the data mapped to streaming DMA
    
    commit 478762855b5ae9f68fa6ead1edf7abada70fcd5f upstream.
    
    In p54p_tx(), skb->data is mapped to streaming DMA on line 337:
      mapping = pci_map_single(..., skb->data, ...);
    
    Then skb->data is accessed on line 349:
      desc->device_addr = ((struct p54_hdr *)skb->data)->req_id;
    
    This access may cause data inconsistency between CPU cache and hardware.
    
    To fix this problem, ((struct p54_hdr *)skb->data)->req_id is stored in
    a local variable before DMA mapping, and then the driver accesses this
    local variable instead of skb->data.

    x86/xen: disable Firmware First mode for correctable memory errors
    
    commit d759af38572f97321112a0852353613d18126038 upstream.
    
    When running as Xen dom0 the kernel isn't responsible for selecting the
    error handling mode, this should be handled by the hypervisor.
    
    So disable setting FF mode when running as Xen pv guest. Not doing so
    might result in boot splats like:
    
    [    7.509696] HEST: Enabling Firmware First mode for corrected errors.
    [    7.510382] mce: [Firmware Bug]: Ignoring request to disable invalid MCA bank 2.
    [    7.510383] mce: [Firmware Bug]: Ignoring request to disable invalid MCA bank 3.
    [    7.510384] mce: [Firmware Bug]: Ignoring request to disable invalid MCA bank 4.
    [    7.510384] mce: [Firmware Bug]: Ignoring request to disable invalid MCA bank 5.

    [    7.510386] mce: [Firmware Bug]: Ignoring request to disable invalid MCA bank 8.
    
    Reason is that the HEST ACPI table contains the real number of MCA
    banks, while the hypervisor is emulating only 2 banks for guests.

    arch/x86/amd/ibs: Fix re-arming IBS Fetch
    
    commit 221bfce5ebbdf72ff08b3bf2510ae81058ee568b upstream.
    
    Stephane Eranian found a bug in that IBS' current Fetch counter was not
    being reset when the driver would write the new value to clear it along
    with the enable bit set, and found that adding an MSR write that would
    first disable IBS Fetch would make IBS Fetch reset its current count.
    
    Indeed, the PPR for AMD Family 17h Model 31h B0 55803 Rev 0.54 - Sep 12,
    2019 states "The periodic fetch counter is set to IbsFetchCnt [...] when
    IbsFetchEn is changed from 0 to 1."
    
    Explicitly set IbsFetchEn to 0 and then to 1 when re-enabling IBS Fetch,
    so the driver properly resets the internal counter to 0 and IBS
    Fetch starts counting again.
    
    A family 15h machine tested does not have this problem, and the extra
    wrmsr is also not needed on Family 19h, so only do the extra wrmsr on
    families 16h through 18h.

    [ Upstream commit 937d8420588421eaa5c7aa5c79b26b42abb288ef ]
    
    The current code sets up the filter action field before
    rewrites are set up. When the action 'switch' is used
    with rewrites, this may result in initial few packets
    that get switched out don't have rewrites applied
    on them.
    
    So, make sure filter action is set up along with rewrites
    or only after everything else is set up for rewrites.

    r8169: fix issue with forced threading in combination with shared interrupts
    
    [ Upstream commit 2734a24e6e5d18522fbf599135c59b82ec9b2c9e ]
    
    As reported by Serge flag IRQF_NO_THREAD causes an error if the
    interrupt is actually shared and the other driver(s) don't have this
    flag set. This situation can occur if a PCI(e) legacy interrupt is
    used in combination with forced threading.
    There's no good way to deal with this properly, therefore we have to
    remove flag IRQF_NO_THREAD. For fixing the original forced threading
    issue switch to napi_schedule().

    tipc: fix memory leak caused by tipc_buf_append()
    
    [ Upstream commit ceb1eb2fb609c88363e06618b8d4bbf7815a4e03 ]
    
    Commit ed42989eab57 ("tipc: fix the skb_unshare() in tipc_buf_append()")
    replaced skb_unshare() with skb_copy() to not reduce the data reference
    counter of the original skb intentionally. This is not the correct
    way to handle the cloned skb because it causes memory leak in 2
    following cases:
     1/ Sending multicast messages via broadcast link
      The original skb list is cloned to the local skb list for local
      destination. After that, the data reference counter of each skb
      in the original list has the value of 2. This causes each skb not
      to be freed after receiving ACK:
      tipc_link_advance_transmq()
      {
       ...
       /* release skb */
       __skb_unlink(skb, &l->transmq);
       kfree_skb(skb); <-- memory exists after being freed
      }
    
     2/ Sending multicast messages via replicast link
      Similar to the above case, each skb cannot be freed after purging
      the skb list:
      tipc_mcast_xmit()
      {
       ...
       __skb_queue_purge(pkts); <-- memory exists after being freed
      }
    
    This commit fixes this issue by using skb_unshare() instead. Besides,
    to avoid use-after-free error reported by KASAN, the pointer to the
    fragment is set to NULL before calling skb_unshare() to make sure that
    the original skb is not freed after freeing the fragment 2 times in
    case skb_unshare() returns NULL.

    tcp: Prevent low rmem stalls with SO_RCVLOWAT.
    
    [ Upstream commit 435ccfa894e35e3d4a1799e6ac030e48a7b69ef5 ]
    
    With SO_RCVLOWAT, under memory pressure,
    it is possible to enter a state where:
    
    1. We have not received enough bytes to satisfy SO_RCVLOWAT.
    2. We have not entered buffer pressure (see tcp_rmem_pressure()).
    3. But, we do not have enough buffer space to accept more packets.
    
    In this case, we advertise 0 rwnd (due to #3) but the application does
    not drain the receive queue (no wakeup because of #1 and #2) so the
    flow stalls.
    
    Modify the heuristic for SO_RCVLOWAT so that, if we are advertising
    rwnd<=rcv_mss, force a wakeup to prevent a stall.
    
    Without this patch, setting tcp_rmem to 6143 and disabling TCP
    autotune causes a stalled flow. With this patch, no stall occurs. This
    is with RPC-style traffic with large messages.

    ravb: Fix bit fields checking in ravb_hwtstamp_get()
    
    [ Upstream commit 68b9f0865b1ef545da180c57d54b82c94cb464a4 ]
    
    In the function ravb_hwtstamp_get() in ravb_main.c with the existing
    values for RAVB_RXTSTAMP_TYPE_V2_L2_EVENT (0x2) and RAVB_RXTSTAMP_TYPE_ALL
    (0x6)
    
    if (priv->tstamp_rx_ctrl & RAVB_RXTSTAMP_TYPE_V2_L2_EVENT)
            config.rx_filter = HWTSTAMP_FILTER_PTP_V2_L2_EVENT;
    else if (priv->tstamp_rx_ctrl & RAVB_RXTSTAMP_TYPE_ALL)
            config.rx_filter = HWTSTAMP_FILTER_ALL;
    
    if the test on RAVB_RXTSTAMP_TYPE_ALL should be true,
    it will never be reached.
    
    This issue can be verified with 'hwtstamp_config' testing program
    (tools/testing/selftests/net/hwtstamp_config.c). Setting filter type
    to ALL and subsequent retrieving it gives incorrect value:
    
    $ hwtstamp_config eth0 OFF ALL
    flags = 0
    tx_type = OFF
    rx_filter = ALL
    $ hwtstamp_config eth0
    flags = 0
    tx_type = OFF
    rx_filter = PTP_V2_L2_EVENT
    
    Correct this by converting if-else's to switch.

    netem: fix zero division in tabledist
    
    [ Upstream commit eadd1befdd778a1eca57fad058782bd22b4db804 ]
    
    Currently it is possible to craft a special netlink RTM_NEWQDISC
    command that can result in jitter being equal to 0x80000000. It is
    enough to set the 32 bit jitter to 0x02000000 (it will later be
    multiplied by 2^6) or just set the 64 bit jitter via
    TCA_NETEM_JITTER64. This causes an overflow during the generation of
    uniformly distributed numbers in tabledist(), which in turn leads to
    division by zero (sigma != 0, but sigma * 2 is 0).
    
    The related fragment of code needs 32-bit division - see commit
    9b0ed89 ("netem: remove unnecessary 64 bit modulus"), so switching to
    64 bit is not an option.
    
    Fix the issue by keeping the value of jitter within the range that can
    be adequately handled by tabledist() - [0;INT_MAX]. As negative std
    deviation makes no sense, take the absolute value of the passed value
    and cap it at INT_MAX. Inside tabledist(), switch to unsigned 32 bit
    arithmetic in order to prevent overflows.

    Without this patch efivarfs_alloc_dentry creates dentries with slashes in

    arm64: link with -z norelro regardless of CONFIG_RELOCATABLE
    
    commit 3b92fa7485eba16b05166fddf38ab42f2ff6ab95 upstream.
    
    With CONFIG_EXPERT=y, CONFIG_KASAN=y, CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE=n,
    CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n, we observe the following failure when trying to
    link the kernel image with LD=ld.lld:
    
    error: section: .exit.data is not contiguous with other relro sections
    
    ld.lld defaults to -z relro while ld.bfd defaults to -z norelro. This
    was previously fixed, but only for CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y.

    arm64: Run ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 enabling code on all CPUs
    
    commit 18fce56134c987e5b4eceddafdbe4b00c07e2ae1 upstream.
    
    Commit 73f381660959 ("arm64: Advertise mitigation of Spectre-v2, or lack
    thereof") changed the way we deal with ARCH_WORKAROUND_1, by moving most
    of the enabling code to the .matches() callback.
    
    This has the unfortunate effect that the workaround gets only enabled on
    the first affected CPU, and no other.
    
    In order to address this, forcefully call the .matches() callback from a
    .cpu_enable() callback, which brings us back to the original behaviour.

    scripts/setlocalversion: make git describe output more reliable
    
    commit 548b8b5168c90c42e88f70fcf041b4ce0b8e7aa8 upstream.
    
    When building for an embedded target using Yocto, we're sometimes
    observing that the version string that gets built into vmlinux (and
    thus what uname -a reports) differs from the path under /lib/modules/
    where modules get installed in the rootfs, but only in the length of
    the -gabc123def suffix. Hence modprobe always fails.
    
    The problem is that Yocto has the concept of "sstate" (shared state),
    which allows different developers/buildbots/etc. to share build
    artifacts, based on a hash of all the metadata that went into building
    that artifact - and that metadata includes all dependencies (e.g. the
    compiler used etc.). That normally works quite well; usually a clean
    build (without using any sstate cache) done by one developer ends up
    being binary identical to a build done on another host. However, one
    thing that can cause two developers to end up with different builds
    [and thus make one's vmlinux package incompatible with the other's
    kernel-dev package], which is not captured by the metadata hashing, is
    this `git describe`: The output of that can be affected by
    
    (1) git version: before 2.11 git defaulted to a minimum of 7, since
    2.11 (git.git commit e6c587) the default is dynamic based on the
    number of objects in the repo
    (2) hence even if both run the same git version, the output can differ
    based on how many remotes are being tracked (or just lots of local
    development branches or plain old garbage)
    (3) and of course somebody could have a core.abbrev config setting in
    ~/.gitconfig
    
    So in order to avoid `uname -a` output relying on such random details
    of the build environment which are rather hard to ensure are
    consistent between developers and buildbots, make sure the abbreviated
    sha1 always consists of exactly 12 hex characters. That is consistent
    with the current rule for -stable patches, and is almost always enough
    to identify the head commit unambigously - in the few cases where it
    does not, the v5.4.3-00021- prefix would certainly nail it down.

    objtool: Support Clang non-section symbols in ORC generation
    
    commit e81e0724432542af8d8c702c31e9d82f57b1ff31 upstream.
    
    When compiling the kernel with AS=clang, objtool produces a lot of
    warnings:
    
      warning: objtool: missing symbol for section .text
      warning: objtool: missing symbol for section .init.text
      warning: objtool: missing symbol for section .ref.text
    
    It then fails to generate the ORC table.
    
    The problem is that objtool assumes text section symbols always exist.
    But the Clang assembler is aggressive about removing them.
    
    When generating relocations for the ORC table, objtool always tries to
    reference instructions by their section symbol offset.  If the section
    symbol doesn't exist, it bails.
    
    Do a fallback: when a section symbol isn't available, reference a
    function symbol instead.
