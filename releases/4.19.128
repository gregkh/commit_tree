    Revert "net/mlx5: Annotate mutex destroy for root ns"
    
    This reverts commit 95fde2e46860c183f6f47a99381a3b9bff488bd5 which is
    commit 9ca415399dae133b00273a4283ef31d003a6818d upstream.
    
    It was backported incorrectly, Paul writes at:
            https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200607203425.GD23662@windriver.com
    
            I happened to notice this commit:
    
            9ca415399dae - "net/mlx5: Annotate mutex destroy for root ns"
    
            ...was backported to 4.19 and 5.4 and v5.6 in linux-stable.
    
            It patches del_sw_root_ns() - which only exists after v5.7-rc7 from:
    
            6eb7a268a99b - "net/mlx5: Don't maintain a case of del_sw_func being
            null"
    
            which creates the one line del_sw_root_ns stub function around
            kfree(node) by breaking it out of tree_put_node().
    
            In the absense of del_sw_root_ns - the backport finds an identical one
            line kfree stub fcn - named del_sw_prio from this earlier commit:
    
            139ed6c6c46a - "net/mlx5: Fix steering memory leak"  [in v4.15-rc5]
    
            and then puts the mutex_destroy() into that (wrong) function, instead of
            putting it into tree_put_node where the root ns case used to be hand

    uprobes: ensure that uprobe->offset and ->ref_ctr_offset are properly aligned
    
    commit 013b2deba9a6b80ca02f4fafd7dedf875e9b4450 upstream.
    
    uprobe_write_opcode() must not cross page boundary; prepare_uprobe()
    relies on arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() which should validate "vaddr" but
    some architectures (csky, s390, and sparc) don't do this.
    
    We can remove the BUG_ON() check in prepare_uprobe() and validate the
    offset early in __uprobe_register(). The new IS_ALIGNED() check matches
    the alignment check in arch_prepare_kprobe() on supported architectures,
    so I think that all insns must be aligned to UPROBE_SWBP_INSN_SIZE.
    
    Another problem is __update_ref_ctr() which was wrong from the very
    beginning, it can read/write outside of kmap'ed page unless "vaddr" is
    aligned to sizeof(short), __uprobe_register() should check this too.

    x86/speculation: Add Special Register Buffer Data Sampling (SRBDS) mitigation
    
    commit 7e5b3c267d256822407a22fdce6afdf9cd13f9fb upstream
    
    SRBDS is an MDS-like speculative side channel that can leak bits from the
    random number generator (RNG) across cores and threads. New microcode
    serializes the processor access during the execution of RDRAND and
    RDSEED. This ensures that the shared buffer is overwritten before it is
    released for reuse.
    
    While it is present on all affected CPU models, the microcode mitigation
    is not needed on models that enumerate ARCH_CAPABILITIES[MDS_NO] in the
    cases where TSX is not supported or has been disabled with TSX_CTRL.
    
    The mitigation is activated by default on affected processors and it
    increases latency for RDRAND and RDSEED instructions. Among other
    effects this will reduce throughput from /dev/urandom.
    
    * Enable administrator to configure the mitigation off when desired using
      either mitigations=off or srbds=off.
    
    * Export vulnerability status via sysfs
    
    * Rename file-scoped macros to apply for non-whitelist table initializations.

    Intel uses the same family/model for several CPUs. Sometimes the

    qfprom has different address spaces for read and write. Reads are
    always done from corrected address space, where as writes are done
    on raw address space.
    Writing to corrected address space is invalid and ignored, so it
    does not make sense to have this support in the driver which only
    supports corrected address space regions at the moment.

    tty: hvc_console, fix crashes on parallel open/close
    
    commit 24eb2377f977fe06d84fca558f891f95bc28a449 upstream.
    
    hvc_open sets tty->driver_data to NULL when open fails at some point.
    Typically, the failure happens in hp->ops->notifier_add(). If there is
    a racing process which tries to open such mangled tty, which was not
    closed yet, the process will crash in hvc_open as tty->driver_data is
    NULL.
    
    All this happens because close wants to know whether open failed or not.
    But ->open should not NULL this and other tty fields for ->close to be
    happy. ->open should call tty_port_set_initialized(true) and close
    should check by tty_port_initialized() instead. So do this properly in
    this driver.
    
    So this patch removes these from ->open:
    * tty_port_tty_set(&hp->port, NULL). This happens on last close.
    * tty->driver_data = NULL. Dtto.
    * tty_port_put(&hp->port). This happens in shutdown and until now, this
      must have been causing a reference underflow, if I am not missing
      something.

    vt: keyboard: avoid signed integer overflow in k_ascii
    
    commit b86dab054059b970111b5516ae548efaae5b3aae upstream.

    signed integer overflow:
    
    UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c:888:19 signed integer overflow:

    While it can be worked around by using check_mul_overflow()/
    check_add_overflow(), it is better to introduce a separate flag to
    signal that number pad is being used to compose a symbol, and
    change type of the accumulator from signed to unsigned, thus
    avoiding undefined behavior when it overflows.

    The session could be disabled in musb_suspend(), which leads the host
    port doesn't stay in host mode.
    
    So let's start the session specifically for host port in musb_resume().

    USB: serial: usb_wwan: do not resubmit rx urb on fatal errors
    
    commit 986c1748c84d7727defeaeca74a73b37f7d5cce1 upstream.
    
    usb_wwan_indat_callback() shouldn't resubmit rx urb if the previous urb
    status is a fatal error. Or the usb controller would keep processing the
    new urbs then run into interrupt storm, and has no chance to recover.

    net: check untrusted gso_size at kernel entry
    
    [ Upstream commit 6dd912f82680761d8fb6b1bb274a69d4c7010988 ]
    
    Syzkaller again found a path to a kernel crash through bad gso input:
    a packet with gso size exceeding len.
    
    These packets are dropped in tcp_gso_segment and udp[46]_ufo_fragment.
    But they may affect gso size calculations earlier in the path.
    
    Now that we have thlen as of commit 9274124f023b ("net: stricter
    validation of untrusted gso packets"), check gso_size at entry too.

    vsock: fix timeout in vsock_accept()
    
    [ Upstream commit 7e0afbdfd13d1e708fe96e31c46c4897101a6a43 ]
    
    The accept(2) is an "input" socket interface, so we should use
    SO_RCVTIMEO instead of SO_SNDTIMEO to set the timeout.
    
    So this patch replace sock_sndtimeo() with sock_rcvtimeo() to
    use the right timeout in the vsock_accept().

    l2tp: do not use inet_hash()/inet_unhash()
    
    [ Upstream commit 02c71b144c811bcdd865e0a1226d0407d11357e8 ]
    
    syzbot recently found a way to crash the kernel [1]
    
    Issue here is that inet_hash() & inet_unhash() are currently
    only meant to be used by TCP & DCCP, since only these protocols
    provide the needed hashinfo pointer.
    
    L2TP uses a single list (instead of a hash table)
    
    This old bug became an issue after commit 610236587600
    ("bpf: Add new cgroup attach type to enable sock modifications")
    since after this commit, sk_common_release() can be called
    while the L2TP socket is still considered 'hashed'.

    l2tp: add sk_family checks to l2tp_validate_socket
    
    [ Upstream commit d9a81a225277686eb629938986d97629ea102633 ]
    
    syzbot was able to trigger a crash after using an ISDN socket
    and fool l2tp.
    
    Fix this by making sure the UDP socket is of the proper family.
