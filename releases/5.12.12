    drm/amd/display: Fix potential memory leak in DMUB hw_init
    
    [ Upstream commit c5699e2d863f58221044efdc3fa712dd32d55cde ]
    
    [Why]
    On resume we perform DMUB hw_init which allocates memory:
    dm_resume->dm_dmub_hw_init->dc_dmub_srv_create->kzalloc
    That results in memory leak in suspend/resume scenarios.
    
    [How]
    Allocate memory for the DC wrapper to DMUB only if it was not
    allocated before.
    No need to reallocate it on suspend/resume.

    On the shrink scan path, the same flag is cleared under lru_lock but because
    of cond_resched_lock(&lru_lock) in gfs2_dispose_glock_lru(), progress on the

    Keep GLF_LRU across the race window opened by cond_resched_lock(&lru_lock) to
    ensure correct behavior on both sides - clear GLF_LRU after list_del under

    HID: multitouch: Disable event reporting on suspend on the Asus T101HA touchpad
    
    [ Upstream commit 31a4cf1d223dc6144d2e7c679cc3a98f84a1607b ]
    
    The Asus T101HA has a problem with spurious wakeups when the lid is
    closed, this is caused by the screen sitting so close to the touchpad
    that the touchpad ends up reporting touch events, causing these wakeups.
    
    Add a quirk which disables event reporting on suspend when set, and
    enable this quirk for the Asus T101HA touchpad fixing the spurious
    wakeups, while still allowing the device to be woken by pressing a
    key on the keyboard (which is part of the same USB device).

    Before this patch, the system ail lists were cleaned up if the logd
    process withdrew, but on other withdraws, they were not cleaned up.
    This included the cleaning up of the revokes as well.
    
    This patch reorganizes things a bit so that all withdraws (not just logd)
    clean up the ail lists, including any pending revokes.

    gfs2: fix a deadlock on withdraw-during-mount
    
    [ Upstream commit 865cc3e9cc0b1d4b81c10d53174bced76decf888 ]
    
    Before this patch, gfs2 would deadlock because of the following
    sequence during mount:
    
    mount
       gfs2_fill_super
          gfs2_make_fs_rw <--- Detects IO error with glock
             kthread_stop(sdp->sd_quotad_process);
                <--- Blocked waiting for quotad to finish
    
    logd
       Detects IO error and the need to withdraw
       calls gfs2_withdraw
          gfs2_make_fs_ro
             kthread_stop(sdp->sd_quotad_process);
                <--- Blocked waiting for quotad to finish
    
    gfs2_quotad
       gfs2_statfs_sync
          gfs2_glock_wait <---- Blocked waiting for statfs glock to be granted
    
    glock_work_func
       do_xmote <---Detects IO error, can't release glock: blocked on withdraw
          glops->go_inval
          glock_blocked_by_withdraw
             requeue glock work & exit <--- work requeued, blocked by withdraw
    
    This patch makes a special exception for the statfs system inode glock,
    which allows the statfs glock UNLOCK to proceed normally. That allows the
    quotad daemon to exit during the withdraw, which allows the logd daemon
    to exit during the withdraw, which allows the mount to exit.

    gpu: host1x: Split up client initalization and registration
    
    [ Upstream commit 0cfe5a6e758fb20be8ad3e8f10cb087cc8033eeb ]
    
    In some cases we may need to initialize the host1x client first before
    registering it. This commit adds a new helper that will do nothing but
    the initialization of the data structure.
    
    At the same time, the initialization is removed from the registration
    function. Note, however, that for simplicity we explicitly initialize
    the client when the host1x_client_register() function is called, as
    opposed to the low-level __host1x_client_register() function. This
    allows existing callers to remain unchanged.

    drm/tegra: sor: Do not leak runtime PM reference
    
    [ Upstream commit 73a395c46704304b96bc5e2ee19be31124025c0c ]
    
    It's theoretically possible for the runtime PM reference to leak if the
    code fails anywhere between the pm_runtime_resume_and_get() and
    pm_runtime_put() calls, so make sure to release the runtime PM reference
    in that case.
    
    Practically this will never happen because none of the functions will
    fail on Tegra, but it's better for the code to be pedantic in case these
    assumptions will ever become wrong.

    HID: usbhid: fix info leak in hid_submit_ctrl
    
    [ Upstream commit 6be388f4a35d2ce5ef7dbf635a8964a5da7f799f ]
    
    In hid_submit_ctrl(), the way of calculating the report length doesn't
    take into account that report->size can be zero. When running the
    syzkaller reproducer, a report of size 0 causes hid_submit_ctrl) to
    calculate transfer_buffer_length as 16384. When this urb is passed to
    the usb core layer, KMSAN reports an info leak of 16384 bytes.
    
    To fix this, first modify hid_report_len() to account for the zero
    report size case by using DIV_ROUND_UP for the division. Then, call it
    from hid_submit_ctrl().

    HID: a4tech: use A4_2WHEEL_MOUSE_HACK_B8 for A4TECH NB-95
    
    [ Upstream commit 9858c74c29e12be5886280725e781cb735b2aca6 ]
    
    This mouse has a horizontal wheel that requires special handling.
    Without this patch, the horizontal wheel acts like a vertical wheel.
    
    In the output of `hidrd-convert` for this mouse, there is a
    `Usage (B8h)` field. It corresponds to a byte in packets sent by the
    device that specifies which wheel generated an input event.
    
    The name "A4TECH" is spelled in all capitals on the company website.

    HID: quirks: Add HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS quirk for Dell K15A keyboard-dock
    
    [ Upstream commit ed80bdc4571fae177c44eba0997a0d551fc21e15 ]
    
    Just like the K12A the Dell K15A keyboard-dock has problems with
    get_feature requests. This sometimes leads to several
    "failed to fetch feature 8" messages getting logged, after which the
    touchpad may or may not work.
    
    Just like the K15A these errors are triggered by undocking and docking
    the tablet.
    
    There also seem to be other problems when undocking and then docking again
    in quick succession. It seems that in this case the keyboard-controller
    still retains some power from capacitors and does not go through a
    power-on-reset leaving it in a confuses state, symptoms of this are:
    
    1. The USB-ids changing to 048d:8910
    2. Failure to read the HID descriptors on the second (mouse) USB intf.
    3. The touchpad freezing after a while
    
    These problems can all be cleared by undocking the keyboard and waiting
    a full minute before redocking it. Unfortunately there is nothing we can
    do about this in the kernel.

    HID: quirks: Set INCREMENT_USAGE_ON_DUPLICATE for Saitek X65
    
    [ Upstream commit 25bdbfbb2d8331a67824dd03d0087e9c98835f3a ]
    
    The Saitek X65 joystick has a pair of axes that were used as mouse
    pointer controls by the Windows driver. The corresponding usage page is
    the Game Controls page, which is not recognized by the generic HID
    driver, and therefore, both axes get mapped to ABS_MISC. The quirk makes
    the second axis get mapped to ABS_MISC+1, and therefore made available
    separately.

    HID: asus: Filter keyboard EC for old ROG keyboard
    
    [ Upstream commit 4bfb2c72b2bfca8684c2f5c25a3119bad016a9d3 ]
    
    Older ROG keyboards emit a similar stream of bytes to the new
    N-Key keyboards and require filtering to prevent a lot of
    unmapped key warnings showing. As all the ROG keyboards use
    QUIRK_USE_KBD_BACKLIGHT this is now used to branch to filtering
    in asus_raw_event.
