    xen/events: avoid handling the same event on two cpus at the same time
    
    commit b6622798bc50b625a1e62f82c7190df40c1f5b21 upstream.
    
    When changing the cpu affinity of an event it can happen today that
    (with some unlucky timing) the same event will be handled on the old
    and the new cpu at the same time.
    
    Avoid that by adding an "event active" flag to the per-event data and
    call the handler only if this flag isn't set.

    xen/events: don't unmask an event channel when an eoi is pending
    
    commit 25da4618af240fbec6112401498301a6f2bc9702 upstream.
    
    An event channel should be kept masked when an eoi is pending for it.
    When being migrated to another cpu it might be unmasked, though.
    
    In order to avoid this keep three different flags for each event channel
    to be able to distinguish "normal" masking/unmasking from eoi related
    masking/unmasking and temporary masking. The event channel should only
    be able to generate an interrupt if all flags are cleared.

    xen/events: reset affinity of 2-level event when tearing it down
    
    commit 9e77d96b8e2724ed00380189f7b0ded61113b39f upstream.
    
    When creating a new event channel with 2-level events the affinity
    needs to be reset initially in order to avoid using an old affinity
    from earlier usage of the event channel port. So when tearing an event
    channel down reset all affinity bits.
    
    The same applies to the affinity when onlining a vcpu: all old
    affinity settings for this vcpu must be reset. As percpu events get
    initialized before the percpu event channel hook is called,
    resetting of the affinities happens after offlining a vcpu (this is
    working, as initial percpu memory is zeroed out).

    KVM: arm64: Fix exclusive limit for IPA size
    
    Commit 262b003d059c6671601a19057e9fe1a5e7f23722 upstream.
    
    When registering a memslot, we check the size and location of that
    memslot against the IPA size to ensure that we can provide guest
    access to the whole of the memory.
    
    Unfortunately, this check rejects memslot that end-up at the exact
    limit of the addressing capability for a given IPA size. For example,
    it refuses the creation of a 2GB memslot at 0x8000000 with a 32bit
    IPA space.
    
    Fix it by relaxing the check to accept a memslot reaching the
    limit of the IPA space.

    hwmon: (lm90) Fix max6658 sporadic wrong temperature reading
    
    commit 62456189f3292c62f87aef363f204886dc1d4b48 upstream.
    
    max6658 may report unrealistically high temperature during
    the driver initialization, for which, its overtemp alarm pin
    also gets asserted. For certain devices implementing overtemp
    protection based on that pin, it may further trigger a reset to
    the device. By reproducing the problem, the wrong reading is
    found to be coincident with changing the conversion rate.
    
    To mitigate this issue, set the stop bit before changing the
    conversion rate and unset it thereafter. After such change, the
    wrong reading is not reproduced. Apply this change only to the
    max6657 kind for now, controlled by flag LM90_PAUSE_ON_CONFIG.

    x86/unwind/orc: Disable KASAN checking in the ORC unwinder, part 2
    
    commit e504e74cc3a2c092b05577ce3e8e013fae7d94e6 upstream.
    
    KASAN reserves "redzone" areas between stack frames in order to detect
    stack overruns.  A read or write to such an area triggers a KASAN
    "stack-out-of-bounds" BUG.
    
    Normally, the ORC unwinder stays in-bounds and doesn't access the
    redzone.  But sometimes it can't find ORC metadata for a given
    instruction.  This can happen for code which is missing ORC metadata, or
    for generated code.  In such cases, the unwinder attempts to fall back
    to frame pointers, as a best-effort type thing.
    
    This fallback often works, but when it doesn't, the unwinder can get
    confused and go off into the weeds into the KASAN redzone, triggering
    the aforementioned KASAN BUG.
    
    But in this case, the unwinder's confusion is actually harmless and
    working as designed.  It already has checks in place to prevent
    off-stack accesses, but those checks get short-circuited by the KASAN
    BUG.  And a BUG is a lot more disruptive than a harmless unwinder
    warning.
    
    Disable the KASAN checks by using READ_ONCE_NOCHECK() for all stack
    accesses.  This finishes the job started by commit 881125bfe65b
    ("x86/unwind: Disable KASAN checking in the ORC unwinder"), which only
    partially fixed the issue.

    binfmt_misc: fix possible deadlock in bm_register_write
    
    commit e7850f4d844e0acfac7e570af611d89deade3146 upstream.
    
    There is a deadlock in bm_register_write:
    
    First, in the begining of the function, a lock is taken on the binfmt_misc
    root inode with inode_lock(d_inode(root)).
    
    Then, if the user used the MISC_FMT_OPEN_FILE flag, the function will call
    open_exec on the user-provided interpreter.
    
    open_exec will call a path lookup, and if the path lookup process includes
    the root of binfmt_misc, it will try to take a shared lock on its inode
    again, but it is already locked, and the code will get stuck in a deadlock
    
    To reproduce the bug:
    $ echo ":iiiii:E::ii::/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/bla:F" > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register

    stop_machine: mark helpers __always_inline
    
    [ Upstream commit cbf78d85079cee662c45749ef4f744d41be85d48 ]
    
    With clang-13, some functions only get partially inlined, with a
    specialized version referring to a global variable.  This triggers a
    harmless build-time check for the intel-rng driver:
    
    WARNING: modpost: drivers/char/hw_random/intel-rng.o(.text+0xe): Section mismatch in reference from the function stop_machine() to the function .init.text:intel_rng_hw_init()
    The function stop_machine() references
    the function __init intel_rng_hw_init().
    This is often because stop_machine lacks a __init
    annotation or the annotation of intel_rng_hw_init is wrong.
    
    In this instance, an easy workaround is to force the stop_machine()
    function to be inline, along with related interfaces that did not show the
    same behavior at the moment, but theoretically could.
    
    The combination of the two patches listed below triggers the behavior in
    clang-13, but individually these commits are correct.

    hrtimer: Update softirq_expires_next correctly after __hrtimer_get_next_event()
    
    [ Upstream commit 46eb1701c046cc18c032fa68f3c8ccbf24483ee4 ]
    
    hrtimer_force_reprogram() and hrtimer_interrupt() invokes
    __hrtimer_get_next_event() to find the earliest expiry time of hrtimer
    bases. __hrtimer_get_next_event() does not update
    cpu_base::[softirq_]_expires_next to preserve reprogramming logic. That
    needs to be done at the callsites.
    
    hrtimer_force_reprogram() updates cpu_base::softirq_expires_next only when
    the first expiring timer is a softirq timer and the soft interrupt is not
    activated. That's wrong because cpu_base::softirq_expires_next is left
    stale when the first expiring timer of all bases is a timer which expires
    in hard interrupt context. hrtimer_interrupt() does never update
    cpu_base::softirq_expires_next which is wrong too.
    
    That becomes a problem when clock_settime() sets CLOCK_REALTIME forward and
    the first soft expiring timer is in the CLOCK_REALTIME_SOFT base. Setting
    CLOCK_REALTIME forward moves the clock MONOTONIC based expiry time of that
    timer before the stale cpu_base::softirq_expires_next.
    
    cpu_base::softirq_expires_next is cached to make the check for raising the
    soft interrupt fast. In the above case the soft interrupt won't be raised
    until clock monotonic reaches the stale cpu_base::softirq_expires_next
    value. That's incorrect, but what's worse it that if the softirq timer
    becomes the first expiring timer of all clock bases after the hard expiry
    timer has been handled the reprogramming of the clockevent from
    hrtimer_interrupt() will result in an interrupt storm. That happens because
    the reprogramming does not use cpu_base::softirq_expires_next, it uses
    __hrtimer_get_next_event() which returns the actual expiry time. Once clock
    MONOTONIC reaches cpu_base::softirq_expires_next the soft interrupt is
    raised and the storm subsides.
    
    Change the logic in hrtimer_force_reprogram() to evaluate the soft and hard
    bases seperately, update softirq_expires_next and handle the case when a
    soft expiring timer is the first of all bases by comparing the expiry times
    and updating the required cpu base fields. Split this functionality into a
    separate function to be able to use it in hrtimer_interrupt() as well
    without copy paste.

    configfs: fix a use-after-free in __configfs_open_file
    
    [ Upstream commit 14fbbc8297728e880070f7b077b3301a8c698ef9 ]
    
    Commit b0841eefd969 ("configfs: provide exclusion between IO and removals")
    uses ->frag_dead to mark the fragment state, thus no bothering with extra
    refcount on config_item when opening a file. The configfs_get_config_item
    was removed in __configfs_open_file, but not with config_item_put. So the
    refcount on config_item will lost its balance, causing use-after-free
    issues in some occasions like this:
    
    Test:
    1. Mount configfs on /config with read-only items:
    drwxrwx--- 289 root   root            0 2021-04-01 11:55 /config
    drwxr-xr-x   2 root   root            0 2021-04-01 11:54 /config/a
    --w--w--w-   1 root   root         4096 2021-04-01 11:53 /config/a/1.txt
    ......
    
    2. Then run:
    for file in /config
    do
    echo $file
    grep -R 'key' $file
    done
    
    3. __configfs_open_file will be called in parallel, the first one
    got called will do:
    if (file->f_mode & FMODE_READ) {
            if (!(inode->i_mode & S_IRUGO))
                    goto out_put_module;
                            config_item_put(buffer->item);
                                    kref_put()
                                            package_details_release()
                                                    kfree()
    
    the other one will run into use-after-free issues like this:

    NFSv4.2: fix return value of _nfs4_get_security_label()
    
    [ Upstream commit 53cb245454df5b13d7063162afd7a785aed6ebf2 ]
    
    An xattr 'get' handler is expected to return the length of the value on
    success, yet _nfs4_get_security_label() (and consequently also
    nfs4_xattr_get_nfs4_label(), which is used as an xattr handler) returns
    just 0 on success.
    
    Fix this by returning label.len instead, which contains the length of
    the result.

    staging: rtl8712: Fix possible buffer overflow in r8712_sitesurvey_cmd
    
    commit b93c1e3981af19527beee1c10a2bef67a228c48c upstream.
    
    Function r8712_sitesurvey_cmd calls memcpy without checking the length.
    A user could control that length and trigger a buffer overflow.
    Fix by checking the length is within the maximum allowed size.

    commit d660f4f42ccea50262c6ee90c8e7ad19a69fb225 upstream.
    
    The memdup_user() function does not necessarily return a NUL terminated

    usbip: fix vudc usbip_sockfd_store races leading to gpf
    
    commit 46613c9dfa964c0c60b5385dbdf5aaa18be52a9c upstream.
    
    usbip_sockfd_store() is invoked when user requests attach (import)
    detach (unimport) usb gadget device from usbip host. vhci_hcd sends
    import request and usbip_sockfd_store() exports the device if it is
    free for export.
    
    Export and unexport are governed by local state and shared state
    - Shared state (usbip device status, sockfd) - sockfd and Device
      status are used to determine if stub should be brought up or shut
      down. Device status is shared between host and client.
    - Local state (tcp_socket, rx and tx thread task_struct ptrs)
      A valid tcp_socket controls rx and tx thread operations while the
      device is in exported state.
    - While the device is exported, device status is marked used and socket,
      sockfd, and thread pointers are valid.
    
    Export sequence (stub-up) includes validating the socket and creating
    receive (rx) and transmit (tx) threads to talk to the client to provide
    access to the exported device. rx and tx threads depends on local and
    shared state to be correct and in sync.
    
    Unexport (stub-down) sequence shuts the socket down and stops the rx and
    tx threads. Stub-down sequence relies on local and shared states to be
    in sync.
    
    There are races in updating the local and shared status in the current
    stub-up sequence resulting in crashes. These stem from starting rx and
    tx threads before local and global state is updated correctly to be in
    sync.
    
    1. Doesn't handle kthread_create() error and saves invalid ptr in local
       state that drives rx and tx threads.
    2. Updates tcp_socket and sockfd,  starts stub_rx and stub_tx threads
       before updating usbip_device status to SDEV_ST_USED. This opens up a
       race condition between the threads and usbip_sockfd_store() stub up
       and down handling.
    
    Fix the above problems:
    - Stop using kthread_get_run() macro to create/start threads.
    - Create threads and get task struct reference.
    - Add kthread_create() failure handling and bail out.
    - Hold usbip_device lock to update local and shared states after
      creating rx and tx threads.
    - Update usbip_device status to SDEV_ST_USED.
    - Update usbip_device tcp_socket, sockfd, tcp_rx, and tcp_tx
    - Start threads after usbip_device (tcp_socket, sockfd, tcp_rx, tcp_tx,
      and status) is complete.
    
    Credit goes to syzbot and Tetsuo Handa for finding and root-causing the
    kthread_get_run() improper error handling problem and others. This is a
    hard problem to find and debug since the races aren't seen in a normal
    case. Fuzzing forces the race window to be small enough for the
    kthread_get_run() error path bug and starting threads before updating the
    local and shared state bug in the stub-up sequence.

    attach_store() is invoked when user requests import (attach) a device

      A valid tcp_socket controls rx and tx thread operations while the
      device is in exported state.
    - Device has to be in the right state to be attached and detached.

    Detach sequence relies on local and shared states to be in sync.
    
    There are races in updating the local and shared status in the current

       before updating usbip_device status to VDEV_ST_NOTASSIGNED. This opens
       up a race condition between the threads, port connect, and detach
       handling.

    - Create threads and get task struct reference.
    - Add kthread_create() failure handling and bail out.

    USB: serial: ch341: add new Product ID
    
    commit 5563b3b6420362c8a1f468ca04afe6d5f0a8d0a3 upstream.
    
    Add PID for CH340 that's found on cheap programmers.
    
    The driver works flawlessly as soon as the new PID (0x9986) is added to it.
    These look like ANU232MI but ship with a ch341 inside. They have no special
    identifiers (mine only has the string "DB9D20130716" printed on the PCB and
    nothing identifiable on the packaging. The merchant i bought it from
    doesn't sell these anymore).
    
    the lsusb -v output is:

    usb: xhci: Fix ASMedia ASM1042A and ASM3242 DMA addressing
    
    commit b71c669ad8390dd1c866298319ff89fe68b45653 upstream.
    
    I've confirmed that both the ASMedia ASM1042A and ASM3242 have the same
    problem as the ASM1142 and ASM2142/ASM3142, where they lose some of the
    upper bits of 64-bit DMA addresses. As with the other chips, this can
    cause problems on systems where the upper bits matter, and adding the
    XHCI_NO_64BIT_SUPPORT quirk completely fixes the issue.

    xhci: Improve detection of device initiated wake signal.
    
    commit 253f588c70f66184b1f3a9bbb428b49bbda73e80 upstream.
    
    A xHC USB 3 port might miss the first wake signal from a USB 3 device
    if the port LFPS reveiver isn't enabled fast enough after xHC resume.
    
    xHC host will anyway be resumed by a PME# signal, but will go back to
    suspend if no port activity is seen.
    The device resends the U3 LFPS wake signal after a 100ms delay, but
    by then host is already suspended, starting all over from the
    beginning of this issue.
    
    USB 3 specs say U3 wake LFPS signal is sent for max 10ms, then device
    needs to delay 100ms before resending the wake.
    
    Don't suspend immediately if port activity isn't detected in resume.
    Instead add a retry. If there is no port activity then delay for 120ms,
    and re-check for port activity.

    usb: renesas_usbhs: Clear PIPECFG for re-enabling pipe with other EPNUM
    
    commit b1d25e6ee57c2605845595b6c61340d734253eb3 upstream.
    
    According to the datasheet, this controller has a restriction
    which "set an endpoint number so that combinations of the DIR bit and
    the EPNUM bits do not overlap.". However, since the udc core driver is
    possible to assign a bulk pipe as an interrupt endpoint, an endpoint
    number may not match the pipe number. After that, when user rebinds
    another gadget driver, this driver broke the restriction because
    the driver didn't clear any configuration in usb_ep_disable().
    
    Example:
     # modprobe g_ncm
     Then, EP3 = pipe 3, EP4 = pipe 4, EP5 = pipe 6
     # rmmod g_ncm
     # modprobe g_hid
     Then, EP3 = pipe 6, EP4 = pipe 7.
     So, pipe 3 and pipe 6 are set as EP3.
    
    So, clear PIPECFG register in usbhs_pipe_free().

    USB: usblp: fix a hang in poll() if disconnected
    
    commit 9de2c43acf37a17dc4c69ff78bb099b80fb74325 upstream.
    
    Apparently an application that opens a device and calls select()
    on it, will hang if the decice is disconnected. It's a little
    surprising that we had this bug for 15 years, but apparently
    nobody ever uses select() with a printer: only write() and read(),
    and those work fine. Well, you can also select() with a timeout.
    
    The fix is modeled after devio.c. A few other drivers check the
    condition first, then do not add the wait queue in case the
    device is disconnected. We doubt that's completely race-free.
    So, this patch adds the process first, then locks properly
    and checks for the disconnect.

    usb: gadget: f_uac2: always increase endpoint max_packet_size by one audio slot
    
    commit 789ea77310f0200c84002884ffd628e2baf3ad8a upstream.
    
    As per UAC2 Audio Data Formats spec (2.3.1.1 USB Packets),
    if the sampling rate is a constant, the allowable variation
    of number of audio slots per virtual frame is +/- 1 audio slot.
    
    It means that endpoint should be able to accept/send +1 audio
    slot.
    
    Previous endpoint max_packet_size calculation code
    was adding sometimes +1 audio slot due to DIV_ROUND_UP
    behaviour which was rounding up to closest integer.
    However this doesn't work if the numbers are divisible.
    
    It had no any impact with Linux hosts which ignore
    this issue, but in case of more strict Windows it
    caused rejected enumeration
    
    Thus always add +1 audio slot to endpoint's max packet size

    Goodix Fingerprint device is not a modem
    
    commit 4d8654e81db7346f915eca9f1aff18f385cab621 upstream.
    
    The CDC ACM driver is false matching the Goodix Fingerprint device
    against the USB_CDC_ACM_PROTO_AT_V25TER.
    
    The Goodix Fingerprint device is a biometrics sensor that should be
    handled in user-space. libfprint has some support for Goodix
    fingerprint sensors, although not for this particular one. It is
    possible that the vendor allocates a PID per OEM (Lenovo, Dell etc).
    If this happens to be the case then more devices from the same vendor
    could potentially match the ACM modem module table.

    s390/dasd: fix hanging IO request during DASD driver unbind
    
    commit 66f669a272898feb1c69b770e1504aa2ec7723d1 upstream.
    
    Prevent that an IO request is build during device shutdown initiated by
    a driver unbind. This request will never be able to be processed or
    canceled and will hang forever. This will lead also to a hanging unbind.
    
    Fix by checking not only if the device is in READY state but also check
    that there is no device offline initiated before building a new IO request.

    s390/dasd: fix hanging DASD driver unbind
    
    commit 7d365bd0bff3c0310c39ebaffc9a8458e036d666 upstream.
    
    In case of an unbind of the DASD device driver the function
    dasd_generic_remove() is called which shuts down the device.
    Among others this functions removes the int_handler from the cdev.
    During shutdown the device cancels all outstanding IO requests and waits
    for completion of the clear request.
    Unfortunately the clear interrupt will never be received when there is no
    interrupt handler connected.
    
    Fix by moving the int_handler removal after the call to the state machine
    where no request or interrupt is outstanding.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Apply the control quirk to Plantronics headsets
    
    commit 06abcb18b3a021ba1a3f2020cbefb3ed04e59e72 upstream.
    
    Other Plantronics headset models seem requiring the same workaround as
    C320-M to add the 20ms delay for the control messages, too.  Apply the
    workaround generically for devices with the vendor ID 0x047f.
    
    Note that the problem didn't surface before 5.11 just with luck.
    Since 5.11 got a big code rewrite about the stream handling, the
    parameter setup procedure has changed, and this seemed triggering the
    problem more often.

    ALSA: hda: Avoid spurious unsol event handling during S3/S4
    
    commit 5ff9dde42e8c72ed8102eb8cb62e03f9dc2103ab upstream.
    
    When HD-audio bus receives unsolicited events during its system
    suspend/resume (S3 and S4) phase, the controller driver may still try
    to process events although the codec chips are already (or yet)
    powered down.  This might screw up the codec communication, resulting
    in CORB/RIRB errors.  Such events should be rather skipped, as the
    codec chip status such as the jack status will be fully refreshed at
    the system resume time.
    
    Since we're tracking the system suspend/resume state in codec
    power.power_state field, let's add the check in the common unsol event
    handler entry point to filter out such events.

    ALSA: hda: Drop the BATCH workaround for AMD controllers
    
    commit 28e96c1693ec1cdc963807611f8b5ad400431e82 upstream.
    
    The commit c02f77d32d2c ("ALSA: hda - Workaround for crackled sound on
    AMD controller (1022:1457)") introduced a few workarounds for the
    recent AMD HD-audio controller, and one of them is the forced BATCH
    PCM mode so that PulseAudio avoids the timer-based scheduling.  This
    was thought to cover for some badly working applications, but this
    actually worsens for more others.  In total, this wasn't a good idea
    to enforce it.
    
    This is a partial revert of the commit above for dropping the PCM
    BATCH enforcement part to recover from the regression again.

    ALSA: hda/hdmi: Cancel pending works before suspend
    
    commit eea46a0879bcca23e15071f9968c0f6e6596e470 upstream.
    
    The per_pin->work might be still floating at the suspend, and this may
    hit the access to the hardware at an unexpected timing.  Cancel the
    work properly at the suspend callback for avoiding the buggy access.
    
    Note that the bug doesn't trigger easily in the recent kernels since
    the work is queued only when the repoll count is set, and usually it's
    only at the resume callback, but it's still possible to hit in
    theory.

    [ Upstream commit 1c73e0c5e54d5f7d77f422a10b03ebe61eaed5ad ]
    
    TCM doesn't properly handle underflow case for service actions. One way to
    prevent it is to always complete command with
    target_complete_cmd_with_length(), however it requires access to data_sg,
    which is not always available.
    
    This change introduces target_set_cmd_data_length() function which allows
    to set command data length before completing it.

    In case a PCI host driver's probe is deferred, the same I/O range may be
    allocated again, and be ignored, causing a memory leak.
    
    Fix this by (a) letting logic_pio_register_range() return -EEXIST if the
    passed range already exists, so pci_register_io_range() will free it, and
    by (b) making pci_register_io_range() not consider -EEXIST an error
    condition.

    PCI: mediatek: Add missing of_node_put() to fix reference leak
    
    [ Upstream commit 42814c438aac79746d310f413a27d5b0b959c5de ]
    
    The for_each_available_child_of_node helper internally makes use of the
    of_get_next_available_child() which performs an of_node_get() on each
    iteration when searching for next available child node.
    
    Should an available child node be found, then it would return a device
    node pointer with reference count incremented, thus early return from
    the middle of the loop requires an explicit of_node_put() to prevent
    reference count leak.
    
    To stop the reference leak, explicitly call of_node_put() before
    returning after an error occurred.

    sparc64: Use arch_validate_flags() to validate ADI flag
    
    [ Upstream commit 147d8622f2a26ef34beacc60e1ed8b66c2fa457f ]
    
    When userspace calls mprotect() to enable ADI on an address range,
    do_mprotect_pkey() calls arch_validate_prot() to validate new
    protection flags. arch_validate_prot() for sparc looks at the first
    VMA associated with address range to verify if ADI can indeed be
    enabled on this address range. This has two issues - (1) Address
    range might cover multiple VMAs while arch_validate_prot() looks at
    only the first VMA, (2) arch_validate_prot() peeks at VMA without
    holding mmap lock which can result in race condition.
    
    arch_validate_flags() from commit c462ac288f2c ("mm: Introduce
    arch_validate_flags()") allows for VMA flags to be validated for all
    VMAs that cover the address range given by user while holding mmap
    lock. This patch updates sparc code to move the VMA check from
    arch_validate_prot() to arch_validate_flags() to fix above two
    issues.

    powerpc/perf: Record counter overflow always if SAMPLE_IP is unset
    
    [ Upstream commit d137845c973147a22622cc76c7b0bc16f6206323 ]
    
    While sampling for marked events, currently we record the sample only
    if the SIAR valid bit of Sampled Instruction Event Register (SIER) is
    set. SIAR_VALID bit is used for fetching the instruction address from
    Sampled Instruction Address Register(SIAR). But there are some
    usecases, where the user is interested only in the PMU stats at each
    counter overflow and the exact IP of the overflow event is not
    required. Dropping SIAR invalid samples will fail to record some of
    the counter overflows in such cases.
    
    Example of such usecase is dumping the PMU stats (event counts) after
    some regular amount of instructions/events from the userspace (ex: via
    ptrace). Here counter overflow is indicated to userspace via signal
    handler, and captured by monitoring and enabling I/O signaling on the
    event file descriptor. In these cases, we expect to get
    sample/overflow indication after each specified sample_period.
    
    Perf event attribute will not have PERF_SAMPLE_IP set in the
    sample_type if exact IP of the overflow event is not requested. So
    while profiling if SAMPLE_IP is not set, just record the counter
    overflow irrespective of SIAR_VALID check.

    powerpc/pci: Add ppc_md.discover_phbs()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5537fcb319d016ce387f818dd774179bc03217f5 ]
    
    On many powerpc platforms the discovery and initalisation of
    pci_controllers (PHBs) happens inside of setup_arch(). This is very early
    in boot (pre-initcalls) and means that we're initialising the PHB long
    before many basic kernel services (slab allocator, debugfs, a real ioremap)
    are available.
    
    On PowerNV this causes an additional problem since we map the PHB registers
    with ioremap(). As of commit d538aadc2718 ("powerpc/ioremap: warn on early
    use of ioremap()") a warning is printed because we're using the "incorrect"
    API to setup and MMIO mapping in searly boot. The kernel does provide
    early_ioremap(), but that is not intended to create long-lived MMIO
    mappings and a seperate warning is printed by generic code if
    early_ioremap() mappings are "leaked."
    
    This is all fixable with dumb hacks like using early_ioremap() to setup
    the initial mapping then replacing it with a real ioremap later on in
    boot, but it does raise the question: Why the hell are we setting up the
    PHB's this early in boot?
    
    The old and wise claim it's due to "hysterical rasins." Aside from amused
    grapes there doesn't appear to be any real reason to maintain the current
    behaviour. Already most of the newer embedded platforms perform PHB
    discovery in an arch_initcall and between the end of setup_arch() and the
    start of initcalls none of the generic kernel code does anything PCI
    related. On powerpc scanning PHBs occurs in a subsys_initcall so it should
    be possible to move the PHB discovery to a core, postcore or arch initcall.
    
    This patch adds the ppc_md.discover_phbs hook and a core_initcall stub that
    calls it. The core_initcalls are the earliest to be called so this will
    any possibly issues with dependency between initcalls. This isn't just an
    academic issue either since on pseries and PowerNV EEH init occurs in an
    arch_initcall and depends on the pci_controllers being available, similarly
    the creation of pci_dns occurs at core_initcall_sync (i.e. between core and
    postcore initcalls). These problems need to be addressed seperately.

    udf: fix silent AED tagLocation corruption
    
    [ Upstream commit 63c9e47a1642fc817654a1bc18a6ec4bbcc0f056 ]
    
    When extending a file, udf_do_extend_file() may enter following empty
    indirect extent. At the end of udf_do_extend_file() we revert prev_epos
    to point to the last written extent. However if we end up not adding any
    further extent in udf_do_extend_file(), the reverting points prev_epos
    into the header area of the AED and following updates of the extents
    (in udf_update_extents()) will corrupt the header.
    
    Make sure that we do not follow indirect extent if we are not going to
    add any more extents so that returning back to the last written extent
    works correctly.

    If phy uses generic driver and autoneg is on, enter command

    And duplex setting has same problem too.
    
    However, if autoneg is on, phy only changes speed and duplex according to
    phydev->advertising, but not phydev->speed and phydev->duplex. So in this
    case, phydev->speed and phydev->duplex don't need to be set in function

    media: usbtv: Fix deadlock on suspend
    
    commit 8a7e27fd5cd696ba564a3f62cedef7269cfd0723 upstream.
    
    usbtv doesn't support power management, so on system suspend the
    .disconnect callback of the driver is called. The teardown sequence
    includes a call to snd_card_free. Its implementation waits until the
    refcount of the sound card device drops to zero, however, if its file is
    open, snd_card_file_add takes a reference, which can't be dropped during
    the suspend, because the userspace processes are already frozen at this
    point. snd_card_free waits for completion forever, leading to a hang on
    suspend.
    
    This commit fixes this deadlock condition by replacing snd_card_free
    with snd_card_free_when_closed, that doesn't wait until all references
    are released, allowing suspend to progress.

    drm/compat: Clear bounce structures
    
    commit de066e116306baf3a6a62691ac63cfc0b1dabddb upstream.
    
    Some of them have gaps, or fields we don't clear. Native ioctl code
    does full copies plus zero-extends on size mismatch, so nothing can
    leak. But compat is more hand-rolled so need to be careful.
    
    None of these matter for performance, so just memset.
    
    Also I didn't fix up the CONFIG_DRM_LEGACY or CONFIG_DRM_AGP ioctl, those
    are security holes anyway.

    selftests: forwarding: Fix race condition in mirror installation
    
    commit edcbf5137f093b5502f5f6b97cce3cbadbde27aa upstream.
    
    When mirroring to a gretap in hardware the device expects to be
    programmed with the egress port and all the encapsulating headers. This
    requires the driver to resolve the path the packet will take in the
    software data path and program the device accordingly.
    
    If the path cannot be resolved (in this case because of an unresolved
    neighbor), then mirror installation fails until the path is resolved.
    This results in a race that causes the test to sometimes fail.
    
    Fix this by setting the neighbor's state to permanent, so that it is
    always valid.

    net: stmmac: fix watchdog timeout during suspend/resume stress test
    
    commit c511819d138de38e1637eedb645c207e09680d0f upstream.
    
    stmmac_xmit() call stmmac_tx_timer_arm() at the end to modify tx timer to
    do the transmission cleanup work. Imagine such a situation, stmmac enters
    suspend immediately after tx timer modified, it's expire callback
    stmmac_tx_clean() would not be invoked. This could affect BQL, since
    netdev_tx_sent_queue() has been called, but netdev_tx_completed_queue()
    have not been involved, as a result, dql_avail(&dev_queue->dql) finally
    always return a negative value.
    
    __dev_queue_xmit->__dev_xmit_skb->qdisc_run->__qdisc_run->qdisc_restart->dequeue_skb:
            if ((q->flags & TCQ_F_ONETXQUEUE) &&
                    netif_xmit_frozen_or_stopped(txq)) // __QUEUE_STATE_STACK_XOFF is set
    
    Net core will stop transmitting any more. Finillay, net watchdong would timeout.
    To fix this issue, we should call netdev_tx_reset_queue() in stmmac_resume().

    net: lapbether: Remove netif_start_queue / netif_stop_queue
    
    commit f7d9d4854519fdf4d45c70a4d953438cd88e7e58 upstream.
    
    For the devices in this driver, the default qdisc is "noqueue",
    because their "tx_queue_len" is 0.
    
    In function "__dev_queue_xmit" in "net/core/dev.c", devices with the
    "noqueue" qdisc are specially handled. Packets are transmitted without
    being queued after a "dev->flags & IFF_UP" check. However, it's possible
    that even if this check succeeds, "ops->ndo_stop" may still have already
    been called. This is because in "__dev_close_many", "ops->ndo_stop" is
    called before clearing the "IFF_UP" flag.
    
    If we call "netif_stop_queue" in "ops->ndo_stop", then it's possible in
    "__dev_queue_xmit", it sees the "IFF_UP" flag is present, and then it
    checks "netif_xmit_stopped" and finds that the queue is already stopped.
    In this case, it will complain that:
    "Virtual device ... asks to queue packet!"
    
    To prevent "__dev_queue_xmit" from generating this complaint, we should
    not call "netif_stop_queue" in "ops->ndo_stop".
    
    We also don't need to call "netif_start_queue" in "ops->ndo_open",
    because after a netdev is allocated and registered, the
    "__QUEUE_STATE_DRV_XOFF" flag is initially not set, so there is no need
    to call "netif_start_queue" to clear it.

    cipso,calipso: resolve a number of problems with the DOI refcounts
    
    commit ad5d07f4a9cd671233ae20983848874731102c08 upstream.
    
    The current CIPSO and CALIPSO refcounting scheme for the DOI
    definitions is a bit flawed in that we:
    
    1. Don't correctly match gets/puts in netlbl_cipsov4_list().
    2. Decrement the refcount on each attempt to remove the DOI from the
       DOI list, only removing it from the list once the refcount drops
       to zero.
    
    This patch fixes these problems by adding the missing "puts" to
    netlbl_cipsov4_list() and introduces a more conventional, i.e.
    not-buggy, refcounting mechanism to the DOI definitions.  Upon the
    addition of a DOI to the DOI list, it is initialized with a refcount
    of one, removing a DOI from the list removes it from the list and
    drops the refcount by one; "gets" and "puts" behave as expected with
    respect to refcounts, increasing and decreasing the DOI's refcount by
    one.

    net/mlx4_en: update moderation when config reset
    
    commit 00ff801bb8ce6711e919af4530b6ffa14a22390a upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a bug that the moderation config will not be
    applied when calling mlx4_en_reset_config. For example, when
    turning on rx timestamping, mlx4_en_reset_config() will be called,
    causing the NIC to forget previous moderation config.
    
    This fix is in phase with a previous fix:
    commit 79c54b6bbf06 ("net/mlx4_en: Fix TX moderation info loss
    after set_ringparam is called")
    
    Tested: Before this patch, on a host with NIC using mlx4, run
    netserver and stream TCP to the host at full utilization.
    $ sar -I SUM 1
                     INTR    intr/s
    14:03:56          sum  48758.00
    
    After rx hwtstamp is enabled:
    $ sar -I SUM 1
    14:10:38          sum 317771.00
    We see the moderation is not working properly and issued 7x more
    interrupts.
    
    After the patch, and turned on rx hwtstamp, the rate of interrupts
    is as expected:
    $ sar -I SUM 1
    14:52:11          sum  49332.00

    net: avoid infinite loop in mpls_gso_segment when mpls_hlen == 0
    
    commit d348ede32e99d3a04863e9f9b28d224456118c27 upstream.
    
    A packet with skb_inner_network_header(skb) == skb_network_header(skb)
    and ETH_P_MPLS_UC will prevent mpls_gso_segment from pulling any headers
    from the packet. Subsequently, the call to skb_mac_gso_segment will
    again call mpls_gso_segment with the same packet leading to an infinite
    loop. In addition, ensure that the header length is a multiple of four,
    which should hold irrespective of the number of stacked labels.

    net: check if protocol extracted by virtio_net_hdr_set_proto is correct
    
    commit 924a9bc362a5223cd448ca08c3dde21235adc310 upstream.
    
    For gso packets, virtio_net_hdr_set_proto sets the protocol (if it isn't
    set) based on the type in the virtio net hdr, but the skb could contain
    anything since it could come from packet_snd through a raw socket. If
    there is a mismatch between what virtio_net_hdr_set_proto sets and
    the actual protocol, then the skb could be handled incorrectly later
    on.
    
    An example where this poses an issue is with the subsequent call to
    skb_flow_dissect_flow_keys_basic which relies on skb->protocol being set
    correctly. A specially crafted packet could fool
    skb_flow_dissect_flow_keys_basic preventing EINVAL to be returned.
    
    Avoid blindly trusting the information provided by the virtio net header
    by checking that the protocol in the packet actually matches the
    protocol set by virtio_net_hdr_set_proto. Note that since the protocol
    is only checked if skb->dev implements header_ops->parse_protocol,
    packets from devices without the implementation are not checked at this
    stage.

    sh_eth: fix TRSCER mask for SH771x
    
    commit 8c91bc3d44dfef8284af384877fbe61117e8b7d1 upstream.
    
    According  to  the SH7710, SH7712, SH7713 Group User's Manual: Hardware,
    Rev. 3.00, the TRSCER register actually has only bit 7 valid (and named
    differently), with all the other bits reserved. Apparently, this was not
    the case with some early revisions of the manual as we have the other
    bits declared (and set) in the original driver.  Follow the suit and add
    the explicit sh_eth_cpu_data::trscer_err_mask initializer for SH771x...

    Revert "mm, slub: consider rest of partial list if acquire_slab() fails"
    
    commit 9b1ea29bc0d7b94d420f96a0f4121403efc3dd85 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 8ff60eb052eeba95cfb3efe16b08c9199f8121cf.
    
    The kernel test robot reports a huge performance regression due to the
    commit, and the reason seems fairly straightforward: when there is
    contention on the page list (which is what causes acquire_slab() to
    fail), we do _not_ want to just loop and try again, because that will
    transfer the contention to the 'n->list_lock' spinlock we hold, and
    just make things even worse.
    
    This is admittedly likely a problem only on big machines - the kernel
    test robot report comes from a 96-thread dual socket Intel Xeon Gold
    6252 setup, but the regression there really is quite noticeable:
    
       -47.9% regression of stress-ng.rawpkt.ops_per_sec
    
    and the commit that was marked as being fixed (7ced37197196: "slub:
    Acquire_slab() avoid loop") actually did the loop exit early very
    intentionally (the hint being that "avoid loop" part of that commit
    message), exactly to avoid this issue.
    
    The correct thing to do may be to pick some kind of reasonable middle
    ground: instead of breaking out of the loop on the very first sign of
    contention, or trying over and over and over again, the right thing may
    be to re-try _once_, and then give up on the second failure (or pick
    your favorite value for "once"..).

    scripts/recordmcount.{c,pl}: support -ffunction-sections .text.* section names
    
    commit 9c8e2f6d3d361439cc6744a094f1c15681b55269 upstream.
    
    When building with -ffunction-sections, the compiler will place each
    function into its own ELF section, prefixed with ".text".  For example,
    a simple test module with functions test_module_do_work() and
    test_module_wq_func():
    
      % objdump --section-headers test_module.o | awk '/\.text/{print $2}'
      .text
      .text.test_module_do_work
      .text.test_module_wq_func
      .init.text
      .exit.text
    
    Adjust the recordmcount scripts to look for ".text" as a section name
    prefix.  This will ensure that those functions will be included in the
    __mcount_loc relocations:
    
      % objdump --reloc --section __mcount_loc test_module.o
      OFFSET           TYPE              VALUE
      0000000000000000 R_X86_64_64       .text.test_module_do_work
      0000000000000008 R_X86_64_64       .text.test_module_wq_func

    commit e940e0895a82c6fbaa259f2615eb52b57ee91a7e upstream.
    
    There are two ref count variables controlling the free()ing of a socket:
    - struct sock::sk_refcnt - which is changed by sock_hold()/sock_put()
    - struct sock::sk_wmem_alloc - which accounts the memory allocated by
      the skbs in the send path.
    
    In case there are still TX skbs on the fly and the socket() is closed,
    the struct sock::sk_refcnt reaches 0. In the TX-path the CAN stack
    clones an "echo" skb, calls sock_hold() on the original socket and
    references it. This produces the following back trace:

    net: Introduce parse_protocol header_ops callback
    
    commit e78b2915517e8fcadb1bc130ad6aeac7099e510c upstream.
    
    Introduce a new optional header_ops callback called parse_protocol and a
    wrapper function dev_parse_header_protocol, similar to dev_parse_header.
    
    The new callback's purpose is to extract the protocol number from the L2
    header, the format of which is known to the driver, but not to the upper
    layers of the stack.

    net: Fix gro aggregation for udp encaps with zero csum
    
    commit 89e5c58fc1e2857ccdaae506fb8bc5fed57ee063 upstream.
    
    We noticed a GRO issue for UDP-based encaps such as vxlan/geneve when the
    csum for the UDP header itself is 0. In that case, GRO aggregation does
    not take place on the phys dev, but instead is deferred to the vxlan/geneve
    driver (see trace below).
    
    The reason is essentially that GRO aggregation bails out in udp_gro_receive()
    for such case when drivers marked the skb with CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY (ice, i40e,
    others) where for non-zero csums 2abb7cdc0dc8 ("udp: Add support for doing
    checksum unnecessary conversion") promotes those skbs to CHECKSUM_COMPLETE
    and napi context has csum_valid set. This is however not the case for zero
    UDP csum (here: csum_cnt is still 0 and csum_valid continues to be false).
    
    At the same time 57c67ff4bd92 ("udp: additional GRO support") added matches
    on !uh->check ^ !uh2->check as part to determine candidates for aggregation,
    so it certainly is expected to handle zero csums in udp_gro_receive(). The
    purpose of the check added via 662880f44203 ("net: Allow GRO to use and set
    levels of checksum unnecessary") seems to catch bad csum and stop aggregation
    right away.
    
    One way to fix aggregation in the zero case is to only perform the !csum_valid
    check in udp_gro_receive() if uh->check is infact non-zero.

    ath9k: fix transmitting to stations in dynamic SMPS mode
    
    commit 3b9ea7206d7e1fdd7419cbd10badd3b2c80d04b4 upstream.
    
    When transmitting to a receiver in dynamic SMPS mode, all transmissions that
    use multiple spatial streams need to be sent using CTS-to-self or RTS/CTS to
    give the receiver's extra chains some time to wake up.
    This fixes the tx rate getting stuck at <= MCS7 for some clients, especially
    Intel ones, which make aggressive use of SMPS.

    netif_device_attach() will unpause the queues so we can't call

    on resume before __alx_open() we'll crash on the NAPI being null:
