    9p/cache.c: Fix memory leak in v9fs_cache_session_get_cookie
    
    commit 962a991c5de18452d6c429d99f3039387cf5cbb0 upstream.
    
    v9fs_cache_session_get_cookie assigns a random cachetag to v9ses->cachetag,
    if the cachetag is not assigned previously.
    
    v9fs_random_cachetag allocates memory to v9ses->cachetag with kmalloc and uses
    scnprintf to fill it up with a cachetag.
    
    But if scnprintf fails, v9ses->cachetag is not freed in the current
    code causing a memory leak.
    
    Fix this by freeing v9ses->cachetag it v9fs_random_cachetag fails.

    kexec: bail out upon SIGKILL when allocating memory.
    
    commit 7c3a6aedcd6aae0a32a527e68669f7dd667492d1 upstream.
    
    syzbot found that a thread can stall for minutes inside kexec_load() after
    that thread was killed by SIGKILL [1].  It turned out that the reproducer
    was trying to allocate 2408MB of memory using kimage_alloc_page() from
    kimage_load_normal_segment().  Let's check for SIGKILL before doing memory
    allocation.

    smack: use GFP_NOFS while holding inode_smack::smk_lock
    
    commit e5bfad3d7acc5702f32aafeb388362994f4d7bd0 upstream.
    
    inode_smack::smk_lock is taken during smack_d_instantiate(), which is
    called during a filesystem transaction when creating a file on ext4.
    Therefore to avoid a deadlock, all code that takes this lock must use
    GFP_NOFS, to prevent memory reclaim from waiting for the filesystem
    transaction to complete.

    Smack: Don't ignore other bprm->unsafe flags if LSM_UNSAFE_PTRACE is set
    
    commit 3675f052b43ba51b99b85b073c7070e083f3e6fb upstream.
    
    There is a logic bug in the current smack_bprm_set_creds():
    If LSM_UNSAFE_PTRACE is set, but the ptrace state is deemed to be
    acceptable (e.g. because the ptracer detached in the meantime), the other
    ->unsafe flags aren't checked. As far as I can tell, this means that
    something like the following could work (but I haven't tested it):
    
     - task A: create task B with fork()
     - task B: set NO_NEW_PRIVS
     - task B: install a seccomp filter that makes open() return 0 under some
       conditions
     - task B: replace fd 0 with a malicious library
     - task A: attach to task B with PTRACE_ATTACH
     - task B: execve() a file with an SMACK64EXEC extended attribute
     - task A: while task B is still in the middle of execve(), exit (which
       destroys the ptrace relationship)
    
    Make sure that if any flags other than LSM_UNSAFE_PTRACE are set in
    bprm->unsafe, we reject the execve().

    tipc: fix unlimited bundling of small messages
    
    [ Upstream commit e95584a889e1902fdf1ded9712e2c3c3083baf96 ]
    
    We have identified a problem with the "oversubscription" policy in the
    link transmission code.
    
    When small messages are transmitted, and the sending link has reached
    the transmit window limit, those messages will be bundled and put into
    the link backlog queue. However, bundles of data messages are counted
    at the 'CRITICAL' level, so that the counter for that level, instead of
    the counter for the real, bundled message's level is the one being
    increased.
    Subsequent, to-be-bundled data messages at non-CRITICAL levels continue
    to be tested against the unchanged counter for their own level, while
    contributing to an unrestrained increase at the CRITICAL backlog level.
    
    This leaves a gap in congestion control algorithm for small messages
    that can result in starvation for other users or a "real" CRITICAL
    user. Even that eventually can lead to buffer exhaustion & link reset.
    
    We fix this by keeping a 'target_bskb' buffer pointer at each levels,
    then when bundling, we only bundle messages at the same importance
    level only. This way, we know exactly how many slots a certain level
    have occupied in the queue, so can manage level congestion accurately.
    
    By bundling messages at the same level, we even have more benefits. Let
    consider this:
    - One socket sends 64-byte messages at the 'CRITICAL' level;
    - Another sends 4096-byte messages at the 'LOW' level;
    
    When a 64-byte message comes and is bundled the first time, we put the
    overhead of message bundle to it (+ 40-byte header, data copy, etc.)
    for later use, but the next message can be a 4096-byte one that cannot
    be bundled to the previous one. This means the last bundle carries only
    one payload message which is totally inefficient, as for the receiver
    also! Later on, another 64-byte message comes, now we make a new bundle
    and the same story repeats...
    
    With the new bundling algorithm, this will not happen, the 64-byte
    messages will be bundled together even when the 4096-byte message(s)
    comes in between. However, if the 4096-byte messages are sent at the
    same level i.e. 'CRITICAL', the bundling algorithm will again cause the
    same overhead.
    
    Also, the same will happen even with only one socket sending small
    messages at a rate close to the link transmit's one, so that, when one
    message is bundled, it's transmitted shortly. Then, another message
    comes, a new bundle is created and so on...
    
    We will solve this issue radically by another patch.

    xen-netfront: do not use ~0U as error return value for xennet_fill_frags()
    
    [ Upstream commit a761129e3625688310aecf26e1be9e98e85f8eb5 ]
    
    xennet_fill_frags() uses ~0U as return value when the sk_buff is not able
    to cache extra fragments. This is incorrect because the return type of
    xennet_fill_frags() is RING_IDX and 0xffffffff is an expected value for
    ring buffer index.
    
    In the situation when the rsp_cons is approaching 0xffffffff, the return
    value of xennet_fill_frags() may become 0xffffffff which xennet_poll() (the
    caller) would regard as error. As a result, queue->rx.rsp_cons is set
    incorrectly because it is updated only when there is error. If there is no
    error, xennet_poll() would be responsible to update queue->rx.rsp_cons.
    Finally, queue->rx.rsp_cons would point to the rx ring buffer entries whose
    queue->rx_skbs[i] and queue->grant_rx_ref[i] are already cleared to NULL.
    This leads to NULL pointer access in the next iteration to process rx ring
    buffer entries.
    
    The symptom is similar to the one fixed in
    commit 00b368502d18 ("xen-netfront: do not assume sk_buff_head list is
    empty in error handling").
    
    This patch changes the return type of xennet_fill_frags() to indicate
    whether it is successful or failed. The queue->rx.rsp_cons will be
    always updated inside this function.

    udp: only do GSO if # of segs > 1
    
    [ Upstream commit 4094871db1d65810acab3d57f6089aa39ef7f648 ]
    
    Prior to this change an application sending <= 1MSS worth of data and
    enabling UDP GSO would fail if the system had SW GSO enabled, but the
    same send would succeed if HW GSO offload is enabled. In addition to this
    inconsistency the error in the SW GSO case does not get back to the
    application if sending out of a real device so the user is unaware of this
    failure.
    
    With this change we only perform GSO if the # of segments is > 1 even
    if the application has enabled segmentation. I've also updated the
    relevant udpgso selftests.

    net: dsa: rtl8366: Check VLAN ID and not ports
    
    [ Upstream commit e8521e53cca584ddf8ec4584d3c550a6c65f88c4 ]
    
    There has been some confusion between the port number and
    the VLAN ID in this driver. What we need to check for
    validity is the VLAN ID, nothing else.
    
    The current confusion came from assigning a few default
    VLANs for default routing and we need to rewrite that
    properly.
    
    Instead of checking if the port number is a valid VLAN
    ID, check the actual VLAN IDs passed in to the callback
    one by one as expected.

    vsock: Fix a lockdep warning in __vsock_release()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d9138ffac24cf8b75366ede3a68c951e6dcc575 ]
    
    Lockdep is unhappy if two locks from the same class are held.
    
    Fix the below warning for hyperv and virtio sockets (vmci socket code
    doesn't have the issue) by using lock_sock_nested() when __vsock_release()
    is called recursively:

    net: Unpublish sk from sk_reuseport_cb before call_rcu
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c7138b33e5c690c308b2a7085f6313fdcb3f616 ]
    
    The "reuse->sock[]" array is shared by multiple sockets.  The going away
    sk must unpublish itself from "reuse->sock[]" before making call_rcu()
    call.  However, this unpublish-action is currently done after a grace
    period and it may cause use-after-free.
    
    The fix is to move reuseport_detach_sock() to sk_destruct().
    Due to the above reason, any socket with sk_reuseport_cb has
    to go through the rcu grace period before freeing it.
    
    It is a rather old bug (~3 yrs).  The Fixes tag is not necessary
    the right commit but it is the one that introduced the SOCK_RCU_FREE
    logic and this fix is depending on it.

    net: ipv4: avoid mixed n_redirects and rate_tokens usage
    
    [ Upstream commit b406472b5ad79ede8d10077f0c8f05505ace8b6d ]
    
    Since commit c09551c6ff7f ("net: ipv4: use a dedicated counter
    for icmp_v4 redirect packets") we use 'n_redirects' to account
    for redirect packets, but we still use 'rate_tokens' to compute
    the redirect packets exponential backoff.
    
    If the device sent to the relevant peer any ICMP error packet
    after sending a redirect, it will also update 'rate_token' according
    to the leaking bucket schema; typically 'rate_token' will raise
    above BITS_PER_LONG and the redirect packets backoff algorithm
    will produce undefined behavior.
    
    Fix the issue using 'n_redirects' to compute the exponential backoff
    in ip_rt_send_redirect().
    
    Note that we still clear rate_tokens after a redirect silence period,
    to avoid changing an established behaviour.
    
    The root cause predates git history; before the mentioned commit in
    the critical scenario, the kernel stopped sending redirects, after
    the mentioned commit the behavior more randomic.

    addrconf_dad_work is kicked to be scheduled when a device is brought
    up. There is a race between addrcond_dad_work getting scheduled and
    taking the rtnl lock and a process taking the link down (under rtnl).
    The latter removes the host route from the inet6_addr as part of
    addrconf_ifdown which is run for NETDEV_DOWN. The former attempts
    to use the host route in __ipv6_ifa_notify. If the down event removes
    the host route due to the race to the rtnl, then the BUG listed above
    occurs.
    
    Since the DAD sequence can not be aborted, add a check for the missing
    host route in __ipv6_ifa_notify. The only way this should happen is due
    to the previously mentioned race. The host route is created when the
    address is added to an interface; it is only removed on a down event
    where the address is kept. Add a warning if the host route is missing
    AND the device is up; this is a situation that should never happen.

    ipv6: drop incoming packets having a v4mapped source address
    
    [ Upstream commit 6af1799aaf3f1bc8defedddfa00df3192445bbf3 ]
    
    This began with a syzbot report. syzkaller was injecting
    IPv6 TCP SYN packets having a v4mapped source address.
    
    After an unsuccessful 4-tuple lookup, TCP creates a request
    socket (SYN_RECV) and calls reqsk_queue_hash_req()
    
    reqsk_queue_hash_req() calls sk_ehashfn(sk)
    
    At this point we have AF_INET6 sockets, and the heuristic
    used by sk_ehashfn() to either hash the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
    is to use ipv6_addr_v4mapped(&sk->sk_v6_daddr)
    
    For the particular spoofed packet, we end up hashing V4 addresses
    which were not initialized by the TCP IPv6 stack, so KMSAN fired
    a warning.
    
    I first fixed sk_ehashfn() to test both source and destination addresses,
    but then faced various problems, including user-space programs
    like packetdrill that had similar assumptions.
    
    Instead of trying to fix the whole ecosystem, it is better
    to admit that we have a dual stack behavior, and that we
    can not build linux kernels without V4 stack anyway.
    
    The dual stack API automatically forces the traffic to be IPv4
    if v4mapped addresses are used at bind() or connect(), so it makes
    no sense to allow IPv6 traffic to use the same v4mapped class.

    erspan: remove the incorrect mtu limit for erspan
    
    [ Upstream commit 0e141f757b2c78c983df893e9993313e2dc21e38 ]
    
    erspan driver calls ether_setup(), after commit 61e84623ace3
    ("net: centralize net_device min/max MTU checking"), the range
    of mtu is [min_mtu, max_mtu], which is [68, 1500] by default.
    
    It causes the dev mtu of the erspan device to not be greater
    than 1500, this limit value is not correct for ipgre tap device.

    Before patch:
    # ip link set erspan0 mtu 1600

    Upon further debugging, it turns out that whenever we trigger this
    issue, the kallsyms removal in bpf_prog_ksym_node_del() was /skipped/
    but yet bpf_jit_free() reported that the entry is /in use/.
    
    Problem is that symbol exposure via bpf_prog_kallsyms_add() but also
    perf_event_bpf_event() were done /after/ bpf_prog_new_fd(). Once the
    fd is exposed to the public, a parallel close request came in right
    before we attempted to do the bpf_prog_kallsyms_add().
    
    Given at this time the prog reference count is one, we start to rip
    everything underneath us via bpf_prog_release() -> bpf_prog_put().
    The memory is eventually released via deferred free, so we're seeing
    that bpf_jit_free() has a kallsym entry because we added it from
    bpf_prog_load() but /after/ bpf_prog_put() from the remote CPU.
    
    Therefore, move both notifications /before/ we install the fd. The
    issue was never seen between bpf_prog_alloc_id() and bpf_prog_new_fd()
    because upon bpf_prog_get_fd_by_id() we'll take another reference to
    the BPF prog, so we're still holding the original reference from the
    bpf_prog_load().

    block: mq-deadline: Fix queue restart handling
    
    [ Upstream commit cb8acabbe33b110157955a7425ee876fb81e6bbc ]
    
    Commit 7211aef86f79 ("block: mq-deadline: Fix write completion
    handling") added a call to blk_mq_sched_mark_restart_hctx() in
    dd_dispatch_request() to make sure that write request dispatching does
    not stall when all target zones are locked. This fix left a subtle race
    when a write completion happens during a dispatch execution on another
    CPU:
    
    CPU 0: Dispatch                 CPU1: write completion
    
    dd_dispatch_request()
        lock(&dd->lock);
        ...
        lock(&dd->zone_lock);       dd_finish_request()
        rq = find request           lock(&dd->zone_lock);
        unlock(&dd->zone_lock);
                                    zone write unlock
                                    unlock(&dd->zone_lock);
                                    ...
                                    __blk_mq_free_request
                                          check restart flag (not set)
                                          -> queue not run
        ...
        if (!rq && have writes)
            blk_mq_sched_mark_restart_hctx()
        unlock(&dd->lock)
    
    Since the dispatch context finishes after the write request completion
    handling, marking the queue as needing a restart is not seen from
    __blk_mq_free_request() and blk_mq_sched_restart() not executed leading
    to the dispatch stall under 100% write workloads.
    
    Fix this by moving the call to blk_mq_sched_mark_restart_hctx() from
    dd_dispatch_request() into dd_finish_request() under the zone lock to
    ensure full mutual exclusion between write request dispatch selection
    and zone unlock on write request completion.

    Do not offset mmap base address because of stack randomization if current
    task does not want randomization.  Note that x86 already implements this
    behaviour.

    kmemleak: increase DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_EARLY_LOG_SIZE default to 16K
    
    [ Upstream commit b751c52bb587ae66f773b15204ef7a147467f4c7 ]
    
    The current default value (400) is too low on many systems (e.g.  some
    ARM64 platform takes up 1000+ entries).
    
    syzbot uses 16000 as default value, and has proved to be enough on beefy
    configurations, so let's pick that value.
    
    This consumes more RAM on boot (each entry is 160 bytes, so in total
    ~2.5MB of RAM), but the memory would later be freed (early_log is
    __initdata).

    ocfs2: wait for recovering done after direct unlock request
    
    [ Upstream commit 0a3775e4f883912944481cf2ef36eb6383a9cc74 ]
    
    There is a scenario causing ocfs2 umount hang when multiple hosts are
    rebooting at the same time.
    
    NODE1                           NODE2               NODE3
    send unlock requset to NODE2
                                    dies
                                                        become recovery master
                                                        recover NODE2
    find NODE2 dead
    mark resource RECOVERING
    directly remove lock from grant list
    calculate usage but RECOVERING marked
    **miss the window of purging
    clear RECOVERING
    
    To reproduce this issue, crash a host and then umount ocfs2
    from another node.
    
    To solve this, just let unlock progress wait for recovery done.

    kbuild: clean compressed initramfs image
    
    [ Upstream commit 6279eb3dd7946c69346a3b98473ed13d3a44adb5 ]
    
    Since 9e3596b0c653 ("kbuild: initramfs cleanup, set target from Kconfig")
    "make clean" leaves behind compressed initramfs images.  Example:
    
      $ make defconfig
      $ sed -i 's|CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE=""|CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE="/tmp/ir.cpio"|' .config
      $ make olddefconfig
      $ make -s
      $ make -s clean
      $ git clean -ndxf | grep initramfs
      Would remove usr/initramfs_data.cpio.gz
    
    clean rules do not have CONFIG_* context so they do not know which
    compression format was used.  Thus they don't know which files to delete.
    
    Tell clean to delete all possible compression formats.
    
    Once patched usr/initramfs_data.cpio.gz and friends are deleted by
    "make clean".

    crypto: hisilicon - Fix double free in sec_free_hw_sgl()
    
    [ Upstream commit 24fbf7bad888767bed952f540ac963bc57e47e15 ]
    
    There are two problems in sec_free_hw_sgl():
    
    First, when sgl_current->next is valid, @hw_sgl will be freed in the
    first loop, but it free again after the loop.
    
    Second, sgl_current and sgl_current->next_sgl is not match when
    dma_pool_free() is invoked, the third parameter should be the dma
    address of sgl_current, but sgl_current->next_sgl is the dma address
    of next chain, so use sgl_current->next_sgl is wrong.
    
    Fix this by deleting the last dma_pool_free() in sec_free_hw_sgl(),
    modifying the condition for while loop, and matching the address for
    dma_pool_free().

    fat: work around race with userspace's read via blockdev while mounting
    
    [ Upstream commit 07bfa4415ab607e459b69bd86aa7e7602ce10b4f ]
    
    If userspace reads the buffer via blockdev while mounting,
    sb_getblk()+modify can race with buffer read via blockdev.
    
    For example,
    
                FS                               userspace
        bh = sb_getblk()
        modify bh->b_data
                                      read
                                        ll_rw_block(bh)
                                          fill bh->b_data by on-disk data
                                          /* lost modified data by FS */
                                          set_buffer_uptodate(bh)
        set_buffer_uptodate(bh)
    
    Userspace should not use the blockdev while mounting though, the udev
    seems to be already doing this.  Although I think the udev should try to
    avoid this, workaround the race by small overhead.

    ARM: 8903/1: ensure that usable memory in bank 0 starts from a PMD-aligned address
    
    [ Upstream commit 00d2ec1e6bd82c0538e6dd3e4a4040de93ba4fef ]
    
    The calculation of memblock_limit in adjust_lowmem_bounds() assumes that
    bank 0 starts from a PMD-aligned address. However, the beginning of the
    first bank may be NOMAP memory and the start of usable memory
    will be not aligned to PMD boundary. In such case the memblock_limit will
    be set to the end of the NOMAP region, which will prevent any memblock
    allocations.

    security: smack: Fix possible null-pointer dereferences in smack_socket_sock_rcv_skb()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f4287e7d98a2954f20bf96c567fdffcd2b63eb9 ]
    
    In smack_socket_sock_rcv_skb(), there is an if statement
    on line 3920 to check whether skb is NULL:
        if (skb && skb->secmark != 0)
    
    This check indicates skb can be NULL in some cases.
    
    But on lines 3931 and 3932, skb is used:
        ad.a.u.net->netif = skb->skb_iif;
        ipv6_skb_to_auditdata(skb, &ad.a, NULL);
    
    Thus, possible null-pointer dereferences may occur when skb is NULL.
    
    To fix these possible bugs, an if statement is added to check skb.
    
    These bugs are found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.

    PCI: exynos: Propagate errors for optional PHYs
    
    [ Upstream commit ddd6960087d4b45759434146d681a94bbb1c54ad ]
    
    devm_of_phy_get() can fail for a number of reasons besides probe
    deferral. It can for example return -ENOMEM if it runs out of memory as
    it tries to allocate devres structures. Propagating only -EPROBE_DEFER
    is problematic because it results in these legitimately fatal errors
    being treated as "PHY not specified in DT".
    
    What we really want is to ignore the optional PHYs only if they have not
    been specified in DT. devm_of_phy_get() returns -ENODEV in this case, so
    that's the special case that we need to handle. So we propagate all
    errors, except -ENODEV, so that real failures will still cause the
    driver to fail probe.

    This fixes an issue in which key down events for function keys would be
    repeatedly emitted even after the user has raised the physical key. For
    example, the driver fails to emit the F5 key up event when going through
    the following steps:
    - fnmode=1: hold FN, hold F5, release FN, release F5
    - fnmode=2: hold F5, hold FN, release F5, release FN
    
    The repeated F5 key down events can be easily verified using xev.

    rtc: pcf85363/pcf85263: fix regmap error in set_time
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ef66122bdb3b839e9f51b76d7e600b6e21ef648 ]
    
    Issue:
        - # hwclock -w
          hwclock: RTC_SET_TIME: Invalid argument
    
    Why:
        - Relative commit: 8b9f9d4dc511 ("regmap: verify if register is
          writeable before writing operations"), this patch
          will always check for unwritable registers, it will compare reg
          with max_register in regmap_writeable.
    
        - The pcf85363/pcf85263 has the capability of address wrapping
          which means if you access an address outside the allowed range
          (0x00-0x2f) hardware actually wraps the access to a lower address.
          The rtc-pcf85363 driver will use this feature to configure the time
          and execute 2 actions in the same i2c write operation (stopping the
          clock and configure the time). However the driver has also
          configured the `regmap maxregister` protection mechanism that will
          block accessing addresses outside valid range (0x00-0x2f).
    
    How:
        - Split of writing regs to two parts, first part writes control
          registers about stop_enable and resets, second part writes
          RTC time and date registers.

    ARM: 8875/1: Kconfig: default to AEABI w/ Clang
    
    [ Upstream commit a05b9608456e0d4464c6f7ca8572324ace57a3f4 ]
    
    Clang produces references to __aeabi_uidivmod and __aeabi_idivmod for
    arm-linux-gnueabi and arm-linux-gnueabihf targets incorrectly when AEABI
    is not selected (such as when OABI_COMPAT is selected).
    
    While this means that OABI userspaces wont be able to upgraded to
    kernels built with Clang, it means that boards that don't enable AEABI
    like s3c2410_defconfig will stop failing to link in KernelCI when built
    with Clang.

    ARM: 8898/1: mm: Don't treat faults reported from cache maintenance as writes
    
    [ Upstream commit 834020366da9ab3fb87d1eb9a3160eb22dbed63a ]
    
    Translation faults arising from cache maintenance instructions are
    rather unhelpfully reported with an FSR value where the WnR field is set
    to 1, indicating that the faulting access was a write. Since cache
    maintenance instructions on 32-bit ARM do not require any particular
    permissions, this can cause our private 'cacheflush' system call to fail
    spuriously if a translation fault is generated due to page aging when
    targetting a read-only VMA.
    
    In this situation, we will return -EFAULT to userspace, although this is
    unfortunately suppressed by the popular '__builtin___clear_cache()'
    intrinsic provided by GCC, which returns void.
    
    Although it's tempting to write this off as a userspace issue, we can
    actually do a little bit better on CPUs that support LPAE, even if the
    short-descriptor format is in use. On these CPUs, cache maintenance
    faults additionally set the CM field in the FSR, which we can use to
    suppress the write permission checks in the page fault handler and
    succeed in performing cache maintenance to read-only areas even in the
    presence of a translation fault.

    of_node_put() is missing thus causing a reference leak.
    
    Hence stash these mid-loop return values in a variable 'err' and add a
    new label err_node_put which executes of_node_put() on the previous node
    and returns 'err' on failure.
    
    Change mid-loop return statements to point to jump to this label to

    mfd: intel-lpss: Remove D3cold delay
    
    [ Upstream commit 76380a607ba0b28627c9b4b55cd47a079a59624b ]
    
    Goodix touchpad may drop its first couple input events when
    i2c-designware-platdrv and intel-lpss it connects to took too long to
    runtime resume from runtime suspended state.
    
    This issue happens becuase the touchpad has a rather small buffer to
    store up to 13 input events, so if the host doesn't read those events in
    time (i.e. runtime resume takes too long), events are dropped from the
    touchpad's buffer.
    
    The bottleneck is D3cold delay it waits when transitioning from D3cold
    to D0, hence remove the delay to make the resume faster. I've tested
    some systems with intel-lpss and haven't seen any regression.

    The problem is that the CHT Whiskey Cove PMIC's builtin i2c-adapter is
    itself a part of an i2c-client (the PMIC). This means that transfers done
    through it take adapter->bus_lock twice, once for the parent i2c-adapter
    and once for its own bus_lock. Lockdep does not like this nested locking.
    
    To make lockdep happy in the case of busses with muxes, the i2c-core's
    i2c_adapter_lock_bus function calls:
    
     rt_mutex_lock_nested(&adapter->bus_lock, i2c_adapter_depth(adapter));
    
    But i2c_adapter_depth only works when the direct parent of the adapter is
    another adapter, as it is only meant for muxes. In this case there is an
    i2c-client and MFD instantiated platform_device in the parent->child chain
    between the 2 devices.
    
    This commit overrides the default i2c_lock_operations, passing a hardcoded
    depth of 1 to rt_mutex_lock_nested, making lockdep happy.
    
    Note that if there were to be a mux attached to the i2c-wc-cht adapter,
    this would break things again since the i2c-mux code expects the
    root-adapter to have a locking depth of 0. But the i2c-wc-cht adapter
    always has only 1 client directly attached in the form of the charger IC
    paired with the CHT Whiskey Cove PMIC.

    ext4: fix potential use after free after remounting with noblock_validity
    
    [ Upstream commit 7727ae52975d4f4ef7ff69ed8e6e25f6a4168158 ]
    
    Remount process will release system zone which was allocated before if
    "noblock_validity" is specified. If we mount an ext4 file system to two
    mountpoints with default mount options, and then remount one of them
    with "noblock_validity", it may trigger a use after free problem when
    someone accessing the other one.
    
     # mount /dev/sda foo
     # mount /dev/sda bar
    
    User access mountpoint "foo"   |   Remount mountpoint "bar"
                                   |
    ext4_map_blocks()              |   ext4_remount()
    check_block_validity()         |   ext4_setup_system_zone()
    ext4_data_block_valid()        |   ext4_release_system_zone()
                                   |   free system_blks rb nodes
    access system_blks rb nodes    |
    trigger use after free         |
    
    This problem can also be reproduced by one mountpint, At the same time,
    add_system_zone() can get called during remount as well so there can be
    racing ext4_data_block_valid() reading the rbtree at the same time.
    
    This patch add RCU to protect system zone from releasing or building
    when doing a remount which inverse current "noblock_validity" mount
    option. It assign the rbtree after the whole tree was complete and
    do actual freeing after rcu grace period, avoid any intermediate state.

    dma-buf/sw_sync: Synchronize signal vs syncpt free
    
    [ Upstream commit d3c6dd1fb30d3853c2012549affe75c930f4a2f9 ]
    
    During release of the syncpt, we remove it from the list of syncpt and
    the tree, but only if it is not already been removed. However, during
    signaling, we first remove the syncpt from the list. So, if we
    concurrently free and signal the syncpt, the free may decide that it is
    not part of the tree and immediately free itself -- meanwhile the
    signaler goes on to use the now freed datastructure.
    
    In particular, we get struck by commit 0e2f733addbf ("dma-buf: make
    dma_fence structure a bit smaller v2") as the cb_list is immediately
    clobbered by the kfree_rcu.

    powerpc: dump kernel log before carrying out fadump or kdump
    
    [ Upstream commit e7ca44ed3ba77fc26cf32650bb71584896662474 ]
    
    Since commit 4388c9b3a6ee ("powerpc: Do not send system reset request
    through the oops path"), pstore dmesg file is not updated when dump is
    triggered from HMC. This commit modified system reset (sreset) handler
    to invoke fadump or kdump (if configured), without pushing dmesg to
    pstore. This leaves pstore to have old dmesg data which won't be much
    of a help if kdump fails to capture the dump. This patch fixes that by
    calling kmsg_dump() before heading to fadump ot kdump.

    [ Upstream commit 69a6bcde7fd3fe6f3268ce26f31d9d9378384c98 ]
    
    Selecting the right parent for the main clock is done using only
    main oscillator enabled bit.
    In case we have this oscillator bypassed by an external signal (no driving
    on the XOUT line), we still use external clock, but with BYPASS bit set.
    So, in this case we must select the same parent as before.
    Create a macro that will select the right parent considering both bits from
    the MOR register.

    arm64: fix unreachable code issue with cmpxchg
    
    [ Upstream commit 920fdab7b3ce98c14c840261e364f490f3679a62 ]
    
    On arm64 build with clang, sometimes the __cmpxchg_mb is not inlined
    when CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING is set.
    Clang then fails a compile-time assertion, because it cannot tell at
    compile time what the size of the argument is:
    
    mm/memcontrol.o: In function `__cmpxchg_mb':
    memcontrol.c:(.text+0x1a4c): undefined reference to `__compiletime_assert_175'
    memcontrol.c:(.text+0x1a4c): relocation truncated to fit: R_AARCH64_CALL26 against undefined symbol `__compiletime_assert_175'
    
    Mark all of the cmpxchg() style functions as __always_inline to
    ensure that the compiler can see the result.

    powerpc/pseries: correctly track irq state in default idle
    
    [ Upstream commit 92c94dfb69e350471473fd3075c74bc68150879e ]
    
    prep_irq_for_idle() is intended to be called before entering
    H_CEDE (and it is used by the pseries cpuidle driver). However the
    default pseries idle routine does not call it, leading to mismanaged
    lazy irq state when the cpuidle driver isn't in use. Manifestations of
    this include:
    
    * Dropped IPIs in the time immediately after a cpu comes
      online (before it has installed the cpuidle handler), making the
      online operation block indefinitely waiting for the new cpu to
      respond.
    
    * Hitting this WARN_ON in arch_local_irq_restore():
            /*
             * We should already be hard disabled here. We had bugs
             * where that wasn't the case so let's dbl check it and
             * warn if we are wrong. Only do that when IRQ tracing
             * is enabled as mfmsr() can be costly.
             */
            if (WARN_ON_ONCE(mfmsr() & MSR_EE))
                    __hard_irq_disable();
    
    Call prep_irq_for_idle() from pseries_lpar_idle() and honor its

    [ Upstream commit 5e4b7e82d497580bc430576c4c9bce157dd72512 ]
    
    Some MMC cards fail to enumerate properly when inserted into an MMC slot
    on sdm845 devices. This is because the clk ops for qcom clks round the
    frequency up to the nearest rate instead of down to the nearest rate.
    For example, the MMC driver requests a frequency of 52MHz from
    clk_set_rate() but the qcom implementation for these clks rounds 52MHz
    up to the next supported frequency of 100MHz. The MMC driver could be
    modified to request clk rate ranges but for now we can fix this in the
    clk driver by changing the rounding policy for this clk to be round down
    instead of round up.

    Bare metal machine checks run an "early" handler in real mode before
    running the main handler which reports the event.
    
    The main handler runs exactly as a normal interrupt handler, after the

    CFAR does not get restored by the windup code, so that will be wrong

    clk: renesas: cpg-mssr: Set GENPD_FLAG_ALWAYS_ON for clock domain
    
    [ Upstream commit f787216f33ce5b5a2567766398f44ab62157114c ]
    
    The CPG/MSSR Clock Domain driver does not implement the
    generic_pm_domain.power_{on,off}() callbacks, as the domain itself
    cannot be powered down.  Hence the domain should be marked as always-on
    by setting the GENPD_FLAG_ALWAYS_ON flag, to prevent the core PM Domain
    code from considering it for power-off, and doing unnessary processing.
    
    Note that this only affects RZ/A2 SoCs.  On R-Car Gen2 and Gen3 SoCs,
    the R-Car SYSC driver handles Clock Domain creation, and offloads only
    device attachment/detachment to the CPG/MSSR driver.

    pinctrl: amd: disable spurious-firing GPIO IRQs
    
    [ Upstream commit d21b8adbd475dba19ac2086d3306327b4a297418 ]
    
    When cold-booting Asus X434DA, GPIO 7 is found to be already configured
    as an interrupt, and the GPIO level is found to be in a state that
    causes the interrupt to fire.
    
    As soon as pinctrl-amd probes, this interrupt fires and invokes
    amd_gpio_irq_handler(). The IRQ is acked, but no GPIO-IRQ handler was
    invoked, so the GPIO level being unchanged just causes another interrupt
    to fire again immediately after.
    
    This results in an interrupt storm causing this platform to hang
    during boot, right after pinctrl-amd is probed.
    
    Detect this situation and disable the GPIO interrupt when this happens.
    This enables the affected platform to boot as normal. GPIO 7 actually is
    the I2C touchpad interrupt line, and later on, i2c-multitouch loads and
    re-enables this interrupt when it is ready to handle it.
    
    Instead of this approach, I considered disabling all GPIO interrupts at
    probe time, however that seems a little risky, and I also confirmed that
    Windows does not seem to have this behaviour: the same 41 GPIO IRQs are
    enabled under both Linux and Windows, which is a far larger collection
    than the GPIOs referenced by the DSDT on this platform.

    powerpc/eeh: Clear stale EEH_DEV_NO_HANDLER flag
    
    [ Upstream commit aa06e3d60e245284d1e55497eb3108828092818d ]
    
    The EEH_DEV_NO_HANDLER flag is used by the EEH system to prevent the
    use of driver callbacks in drivers that have been bound part way
    through the recovery process. This is necessary to prevent later stage
    handlers from being called when the earlier stage handlers haven't,
    which can be confusing for drivers.
    
    However, the flag is set for all devices that are added after boot
    time and only cleared at the end of the EEH recovery process. This
    results in hot plugged devices erroneously having the flag set during
    the first recovery after they are added (causing their driver's
    handlers to be incorrectly ignored).
    
    To remedy this, clear the flag at the beginning of recovery
    processing. The flag is still cleared at the end of recovery
    processing, although it is no longer really necessary.
    
    Also clear the flag during eeh_handle_special_event(), for the same
    reasons.

    [ Upstream commit 38a0d0cdb46d3f91534e5b9839ec2d67be14c59d ]
    
    We see warnings such as:
      kernel/futex.c: In function 'do_futex':
      kernel/futex.c:1676:17: warning: 'oldval' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
         return oldval == cmparg;
                       ^
      kernel/futex.c:1651:6: note: 'oldval' was declared here
        int oldval, ret;
            ^
    
    This is because arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser() only sets *oval if ret
    is 0 and GCC doesn't see that it will only use it when ret is 0.
    
    Anyway, the non-zero ret path is an error path that won't suffer from
    setting *oval, and as *oval is a local var in futex_atomic_op_inuser()
    it will have no impact.

    powerpc/rtas: use device model APIs and serialization during LPM
    
    [ Upstream commit a6717c01ddc259f6f73364779df058e2c67309f8 ]
    
    The LPAR migration implementation and userspace-initiated cpu hotplug
    can interleave their executions like so:
    
    1. Set cpu 7 offline via sysfs.
    
    2. Begin a partition migration, whose implementation requires the OS
       to ensure all present cpus are online; cpu 7 is onlined:
    
         rtas_ibm_suspend_me -> rtas_online_cpus_mask -> cpu_up
    
       This sets cpu 7 online in all respects except for the cpu's
       corresponding struct device; dev->offline remains true.
    
    3. Set cpu 7 online via sysfs. _cpu_up() determines that cpu 7 is
       already online and returns success. The driver core (device_online)
       sets dev->offline = false.
    
    4. The migration completes and restores cpu 7 to offline state:
    
         rtas_ibm_suspend_me -> rtas_offline_cpus_mask -> cpu_down
    
    This leaves cpu7 in a state where the driver core considers the cpu
    device online, but in all other respects it is offline and
    unused. Attempts to online the cpu via sysfs appear to succeed but the
    driver core actually does not pass the request to the lower-level
    cpuhp support code. This makes the cpu unusable until the cpu device
    is manually set offline and then online again via sysfs.
    
    Instead of directly calling cpu_up/cpu_down, the migration code should
    use the higher-level device core APIs to maintain consistent state and
    serialize operations.

    powerpc/xmon: Check for HV mode when dumping XIVE info from OPAL
    
    [ Upstream commit c3e0dbd7f780a58c4695f1cd8fc8afde80376737 ]
    
    Currently, the xmon 'dx' command calls OPAL to dump the XIVE state in
    the OPAL logs and also outputs some of the fields of the internal XIVE
    structures in Linux. The OPAL calls can only be done on baremetal
    (PowerNV) and they crash a pseries machine. Fix by checking the
    hypervisor feature of the CPU.

    powerpc/powernv/ioda2: Allocate TCE table levels on demand for default DMA window
    
    [ Upstream commit c37c792dec0929dbb6360a609fb00fa20bb16fc2 ]
    
    We allocate only the first level of multilevel TCE tables for KVM
    already (alloc_userspace_copy==true), and the rest is allocated on demand.
    This is not enabled though for bare metal.
    
    This removes the KVM limitation (implicit, via the alloc_userspace_copy
    parameter) and always allocates just the first level. The on-demand
    allocation of missing levels is already implemented.
    
    As from now on DMA map might happen with disabled interrupts, this
    allocates TCEs with GFP_ATOMIC; otherwise lockdep reports errors 1].
    In practice just a single page is allocated there so chances for failure
    are quite low.
    
    To save time when creating a new clean table, this skips non-allocated
    indirect TCE entries in pnv_tce_free just like we already do in
    the VFIO IOMMU TCE driver.
    
    This changes the default level number from 1 to 2 to reduce the amount
    of memory required for the default 32bit DMA window at the boot time.
    The default window size is up to 2GB which requires 4MB of TCEs which is
    unlikely to be used entirely or at all as most devices these days are
    64bit capable so by switching to 2 levels by default we save 4032KB of
    RAM per a device.
    
    While at this, add __GFP_NOWARN to alloc_pages_node() as the userspace
    can trigger this path via VFIO, see the failure and try creating a table
    again with different parameters which might succeed.

    [ Upstream commit 1cbcfc975164f397b449efb17f59d81a703090db ]
    
    [Why]
    When endpoint is at the boundary of a region, such as at 2^0=1
    we find that the last segment has a sharp slope and some points
    are clipped at the top.
    
    [How]
    If end point is 1, which is exactly at the 2^0 region boundary, we
    need to program an additional region beyond this point.

    [ Upstream commit 340ff31ab00bca5c15915e70ad9ada3030c98cf8 ]
    
    ipmi_thread() uses back-to-back schedule() to poll for command
    completion which, on some machines, can push up CPU consumption and
    heavily tax the scheduler locks leading to noticeable overall
    performance degradation.
    
    This was originally added so firmware updates through IPMI would
    complete in a timely manner.  But we can't kill the scheduler
    locks for that one use case.
    
    Instead, only run schedule() continuously in maintenance mode,
    where firmware updates should run.

    [ Upstream commit f3eb9b8f67bc28783eddc142ad805ebdc53d6339 ]
    
    In radeon_connector_set_property(), there is an if statement on line 743
    to check whether connector->encoder is NULL:
        if (connector->encoder)
    
    When connector->encoder is NULL, it is used on line 755:
        if (connector->encoder->crtc)
    
    Thus, a possible null-pointer dereference may occur.
    
    To fix this bug, connector->encoder is checked before being used.
    
    This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.

    drm/panel: simple: fix AUO g185han01 horizontal blanking
    
    [ Upstream commit f8c6bfc612b56f02e1b8fae699dff12738aaf889 ]
    
    The horizontal blanking periods are too short, as the values are
    specified for a single LVDS channel. Since this panel is dual LVDS
    they need to be doubled. With this change the panel reaches its
    nominal vrefresh rate of 60Fps, instead of the 64Fps with the
    current wrong blanking.
    
    Philipp Zabel added:
    The datasheet specifies 960 active clocks + 40/128/160 clocks blanking
    on each of the two LVDS channels (min/typical/max), so doubled this is
    now correct.

    [ Upstream commit e0655feaec62d5139b6b13a7b1bbb1ab8f1c2d83 ]
    
    According to the datasheet tc358767 can transfer up to 16 bytes via
    its AUX channel, so the artificial limit of 8 appears to be too
    low. However only up to 15-bytes seem to be actually supported and
    trying to use 16-byte transfers results in transfers failing
    sporadically (with bogus status in case of I2C transfers), so limit it
    to 15.
