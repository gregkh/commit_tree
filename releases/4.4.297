    phonet/pep: refuse to enable an unbound pipe
    
    commit 75a2f31520095600f650597c0ac41f48b5ba0068 upstream.
    
    This ioctl() implicitly assumed that the socket was already bound to
    a valid local socket name, i.e. Phonet object. If the socket was not
    bound, two separate problems would occur:
    
    1) We'd send an pipe enablement request with an invalid source object.
    2) Later socket calls could BUG on the socket unexpectedly being
       connected yet not bound to a valid object.

    hamradio: improve the incomplete fix to avoid NPD
    
    commit b2f37aead1b82a770c48b5d583f35ec22aabb61e upstream.
    
    The previous commit 3e0588c291d6 ("hamradio: defer ax25 kfree after
    unregister_netdev") reorder the kfree operations and unregister_netdev
    operation to prevent UAF.
    
    This commit improves the previous one by also deferring the nullify of
    the ax->tty pointer. Otherwise, a NULL pointer dereference bug occurs.
    Partial of the stack trace is shown below.

    hamradio: defer ax25 kfree after unregister_netdev
    
    commit 3e0588c291d6ce225f2b891753ca41d45ba42469 upstream.
    
    There is a possible race condition (use-after-free) like below
    
     (USE)                       |  (FREE)
    ax25_sendmsg                 |
     ax25_queue_xmit             |
      dev_queue_xmit             |
       __dev_queue_xmit          |
        __dev_xmit_skb           |
         sch_direct_xmit         | ...
          xmit_one               |
           netdev_start_xmit     | tty_ldisc_kill
            __netdev_start_xmit  |  mkiss_close
             ax_xmit             |   kfree
              ax_encaps          |
                                 |
    
    Even though there are two synchronization primitives before the kfree:
    1. wait_for_completion(&ax->dead). This can prevent the race with
    routines from mkiss_ioctl. However, it cannot stop the routine coming
    from upper layer, i.e., the ax25_sendmsg.
    
    2. netif_stop_queue(ax->dev). It seems that this line of code aims to
    halt the transmit queue but it fails to stop the routine that already
    being xmit.
    
    This patch reorder the kfree after the unregister_netdev to avoid the
    possible UAF as the unregister_netdev() is well synchronized and won't
    return if there is a running routine.

    ax25: NPD bug when detaching AX25 device
    
    commit 1ade48d0c27d5da1ccf4b583d8c5fc8b534a3ac8 upstream.
    
    The existing cleanup routine implementation is not well synchronized
    with the syscall routine. When a device is detaching, below race could
    occur.
    
    static int ax25_sendmsg(...) {
      ...
      lock_sock()
      ax25 = sk_to_ax25(sk);
      if (ax25->ax25_dev == NULL) // CHECK
      ...
      ax25_queue_xmit(skb, ax25->ax25_dev->dev); // USE
      ...
    }
    
    static void ax25_kill_by_device(...) {
      ...
      if (s->ax25_dev == ax25_dev) {
        s->ax25_dev = NULL;
        ...
    }
    
    Other syscall functions like ax25_getsockopt, ax25_getname,
    ax25_info_show also suffer from similar races. To fix them, this patch
    introduce lock_sock() into ax25_kill_by_device in order to guarantee
    that the nullify action in cleanup routine cannot proceed when another
    socket request is pending.

    ARM: 9169/1: entry: fix Thumb2 bug in iWMMXt exception handling
    
    commit 8536a5ef886005bc443c2da9b842d69fd3d7647f upstream.
    
    The Thumb2 version of the FP exception handling entry code treats the
    register holding the CP number (R8) differently, resulting in the iWMMXT
    CP number check to be incorrect.
    
    Fix this by unifying the ARM and Thumb2 code paths, and switch the
    order of the additions of the TI_USED_CP offset and the shifted CP
    index.

    hwmon: (lm90) Fix usage of CONFIG2 register in detect function
    
    [ Upstream commit fce15c45d3fbd9fc1feaaf3210d8e3f8b33dfd3a ]
    
    The detect function had a comment "Make compiler happy" when id did not
    read the second configuration register. As it turns out, the code was
    checking the contents of this register for manufacturer ID 0xA1 (NXP
    Semiconductor/Philips), but never actually read the register. So it
    wasn't surprising that the compiler complained, and it indeed had a point.
    Fix the code to read the register contents for manufacturer ID 0xa1.
    
    At the same time, the code was reading the register for manufacturer ID
    0x41 (Analog Devices), but it was not using the results. In effect it was
    just checking if reading the register returned an error. That doesn't
    really add much if any value, so stop doing that.
