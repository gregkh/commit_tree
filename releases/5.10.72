    libata: Add ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_ON_ATI for Samsung 860 and 870 SSD.
    
    commit 7a8526a5cd51cf5f070310c6c37dd7293334ac49 upstream.
    
    Many users are reporting that the Samsung 860 and 870 SSD are having
    various issues when combined with AMD/ATI (vendor ID 0x1002)  SATA
    controllers and only completely disabling NCQ helps to avoid these
    issues.
    
    Always disabling NCQ for Samsung 860/870 SSDs regardless of the host
    SATA adapter vendor will cause I/O performance degradation with well
    behaved adapters. To limit the performance impact to ATI adapters,
    introduce the ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_ON_ATI flag to force disable NCQ
    only for these adapters.
    
    Also, two libata.force parameters (noncqati and ncqati) are introduced
    to disable and enable the NCQ for the system which equipped with ATI
    SATA adapter and Samsung 860 and 870 SSDs. The user can determine NCQ
    function to be enabled or disabled according to the demand.
    
    After verifying the chipset from the user reports, the issue appears
    on AMD/ATI SB7x0/SB8x0/SB9x0 SATA Controllers and does not appear on
    recent AMD SATA adapters. The vendor ID of ATI should be 0x1002.
    Therefore, ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_ON_AMD was modified to
    ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_ON_ATI.

    perf/x86: Reset destroy callback on event init failure
    
    commit 02d029a41dc986e2d5a77ecca45803857b346829 upstream.
    
    perf_init_event tries multiple init callbacks and does not reset the
    event state between tries. When x86_pmu_event_init runs, it
    unconditionally sets the destroy callback to hw_perf_event_destroy. On
    the next init attempt after x86_pmu_event_init, in perf_try_init_event,
    if the pmu's capabilities includes PERF_PMU_CAP_NO_EXCLUDE, the destroy
    callback will be run. However, if the next init didn't set the destroy
    callback, hw_perf_event_destroy will be run (since the callback wasn't
    reset).
    
    Looking at other pmu init functions, the common pattern is to only set
    the destroy callback on a successful init. Resetting the callback on
    failure tries to replicate that pattern.
    
    This was discovered after commit f11dd0d80555 ("perf/x86/amd/ibs: Extend
    PERF_PMU_CAP_NO_EXCLUDE to IBS Op") when the second (and only second)
    run of the perf tool after a reboot results in 0 samples being
    generated. The extra run of hw_perf_event_destroy results in
    active_events having an extra decrement on each perf run. The second run
    has active_events == 0 and every subsequent run has active_events < 0.
    When active_events == 0, the NMI handler will early-out and not record
    any samples.

    KVM: do not shrink halt_poll_ns below grow_start
    
    [ Upstream commit ae232ea460888dc5a8b37e840c553b02521fbf18 ]
    
    grow_halt_poll_ns() ignores values between 0 and
    halt_poll_ns_grow_start (10000 by default). However,
    when we shrink halt_poll_ns we may fall way below
    halt_poll_ns_grow_start and endup with halt_poll_ns
    values that don't make a lot of sense: like 1 or 9,
    or 19.
    
    VCPU1 trace (halt_poll_ns_shrink equals 2):
    
    VCPU1 grow 10000
    VCPU1 shrink 5000
    VCPU1 shrink 2500
    VCPU1 shrink 1250
    VCPU1 shrink 625
    VCPU1 shrink 312
    VCPU1 shrink 156
    VCPU1 shrink 78
    VCPU1 shrink 39
    VCPU1 shrink 19
    VCPU1 shrink 9
    VCPU1 shrink 4
    
    Mirror what grow_halt_poll_ns() does and set halt_poll_ns
    to 0 as soon as new shrink-ed halt_poll_ns value falls
    below halt_poll_ns_grow_start.

    [ Upstream commit 01f91acb55be7aac3950b89c458bcea9ef6e4f49 ]
    
    The SMC64 calling convention passes a function identifier in w0 and its
    parameters in x1-x17. Given this, there are two deviations in the
    SMC64 call performed by the steal_time test: the function identifier is
    assigned to a 64 bit register and the parameter is only 32 bits wide.
    
    Align the call with the SMCCC by using a 32 bit register to handle the
    function identifier and increasing the parameter width to 64 bits.

    irqchip/gic: Work around broken Renesas integration
    
    [ Upstream commit b78f26926b17cc289e4f16b63363abe0aa2e8efc ]
    
    Geert reported that the GIC driver locks up on a Renesas system
    since 005c34ae4b44f085 ("irqchip/gic: Atomically update affinity")
    fixed the driver to use writeb_relaxed() instead of writel_relaxed().
    
    As it turns out, the interconnect used on this system mandates
    32bit wide accesses for all MMIO transactions, even if the GIC
    architecture specifically mandates for some registers to be byte
    accessible. Gahhh...
    
    Work around the issue by crudly detecting the offending system,
    and falling back to an inefficient RMW+lock implementation.

    Some devices can have some thermal sensors disabled from the

    will to try the very same operation again, thus we don't make any

    [ Upstream commit 0a5ff77bf0a94468d541735f919a633f167787e9 ]
    
    Couple of fixes to the LBW RR configuration:
    
    1. Add missing configuration of the SM RR registers in the DMA_IF.
    2. Remove HBW range that doesn't belong.
    3. Add entire gap + DBG area, from end of TPC7 to end of entire
       DBG space.

    usb: testusb: Fix for showing the connection speed
    
    [ Upstream commit f81c08f897adafd2ed43f86f00207ff929f0b2eb ]
    
    testusb' application which uses 'usbtest' driver reports 'unknown speed'
    from the function 'find_testdev'. The variable 'entry->speed' was not
    updated from  the application. The IOCTL mentioned in the FIXME comment can
    only report whether the connection is low speed or not. Speed is read using
    the IOCTL USBDEVFS_GET_SPEED which reports the proper speed grade.  The
    call is implemented in the function 'handle_testdev' where the file
    descriptor was availble locally. Sample output is given below where 'high
    speed' is printed as the connected speed.

    ext2: fix sleeping in atomic bugs on error

    The ext2_error() function syncs the filesystem so it sleeps.  The caller
    is holding a spinlock so it's not allowed to sleep.

       -> ext2_count_free_blocks()

    sparc64: fix pci_iounmap() when CONFIG_PCI is not set
    
    [ Upstream commit d8b1e10a2b8efaf71d151aa756052fbf2f3b6d57 ]
    
    Guenter reported [1] that the pci_iounmap() changes remain problematic,
    with sparc64 allnoconfig and tinyconfig still not building due to the
    header file changes and confusion with the arch-specific pci_iounmap()
    implementation.
    
    I'm pretty convinced that sparc should just use GENERIC_IOMAP instead of
    doing its own thing, since it turns out that the sparc64 version of
    pci_iounmap() is somewhat buggy (see [2]).  But in the meantime, this
    just fixes the build by avoiding the trivial re-definition of the empty
    case.

    net: mdio: introduce a shutdown method to mdio device drivers
    
    [ Upstream commit cf9579976f724ad517cc15b7caadea728c7e245c ]
    
    MDIO-attached devices might have interrupts and other things that might
    need quiesced when we kexec into a new kernel. Things are even more
    creepy when those interrupt lines are shared, and in that case it is
    absolutely mandatory to disable all interrupt sources.
    
    Moreover, MDIO devices might be DSA switches, and DSA needs its own
    shutdown method to unlink from the DSA master, which is a new
    requirement that appeared after commit 2f1e8ea726e9 ("net: dsa: link
    interfaces with the DSA master to get rid of lockdep warnings").
    
    So introduce a ->shutdown method in the MDIO device driver structure.

    btrfs: fix mount failure due to past and transient device flush error
    
    [ Upstream commit 6b225baababf1e3d41a4250e802cbd193e1343fb ]
    
    When we get an error flushing one device, during a super block commit, we
    record the error in the device structure, in the field 'last_flush_error'.
    This is used to later check if we should error out the super block commit,
    depending on whether the number of flush errors is greater than or equals
    to the maximum tolerated device failures for a raid profile.
    
    However if we get a transient device flush error, unmount the filesystem
    and later try to mount it, we can fail the mount because we treat that
    past error as critical and consider the device is missing. Even if it's
    very likely that the error will happen again, as it's probably due to a
    hardware related problem, there may be cases where the error might not
    happen again. One example is during testing, and a test case like the
    new generic/648 from fstests always triggers this. The test cases
    generic/019 and generic/475 also trigger this scenario, but very
    sporadically.
    
    When this happens we get an error like this:
    
      $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt
      mount: /mnt wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdc, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.
    
      $ dmesg
      (...)
      [12918.886926] BTRFS warning (device sdc): chunk 13631488 missing 1 devices, max tolerance is 0 for writable mount
      [12918.888293] BTRFS warning (device sdc): writable mount is not allowed due to too many missing devices
      [12918.890853] BTRFS error (device sdc): open_ctree failed
    
    The failure happens because when btrfs_check_rw_degradable() is called at
    mount time, or at remount from RO to RW time, is sees a non zero value in
    a device's ->last_flush_error attribute, and therefore considers that the
    device is 'missing'.
    
    Fix this by setting a device's ->last_flush_error to zero when we close a
    device, making sure the error is not seen on the next mount attempt. We
    only need to track flush errors during the current mount, so that we never
    commit a super block if such errors happened.

    [ Upstream commit bbc9a6eb5eec03dcafee266b19f56295e3b2aa8f ]
    
    There is a BUG_ON() in btrfs_csum_one_bio() to catch code logic error.
    It has indeed caught several bugs during subpage development.
    But the BUG_ON() itself will bring down the whole system which is
    an overkill.
    
    Replace it with a WARN() and exit gracefully, so that it won't crash the
    whole system while we can still catch the code logic error.
