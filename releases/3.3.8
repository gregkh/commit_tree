    md: Avoid OOPS when reshaping raid1 to raid0
    
    commit 24b961f811a3e790a9b93604d2594bfb6cce4fa4 upstream.
    
    raid1 arrays do not have the notion of chunk size. Calculate the
    largest chunk sector size we can use to avoid a divide by zero OOPS
    when aligning the size of the new array to the chunk size.

    rtlwifi: rtl8192de: Fix firmware initialization
    
    commit 0298dc9f2273fb2d596ae10d7700f054bfce601d upstream.
    
    Before the switch to asynchronous firmware loading (mainline commit b0302ab),
    it was necessary to load firmware when initializing the first of the units
    in a dual-mac system. After the change, it is necessary to load firmware in
    both units.

    commit a129a7c84582629741e5fa6f40026efcd7a65bd4 upstream.
    
    When running on 32bit the mce handler could misinterpret
    vm86 mode as ring 0. This can affect whether it does recovery
    or not; it was possible to panic when recovery was actually
    possible.

    ARM: 7409/1: Do not call flush_cache_user_range with mmap_sem held
    
    commit 435a7ef52db7d86e67a009b36cac1457f8972391 upstream.
    
    We can't be holding the mmap_sem while calling flush_cache_user_range
    because the flush can fault. If we fault on a user address, the
    page fault handler will try to take mmap_sem again. Since both places
    acquire the read lock, most of the time it succeeds. However, if another
    thread tries to acquire the write lock on the mmap_sem (e.g. mmap) in
    between the call to flush_cache_user_range and the fault, the down_read
    in do_page_fault will deadlock.

    In commit b0302ab, the rtlwifi family of drivers was converted to use

    x86, relocs: Add jiffies and jiffies_64 to the relative whitelist
    
    commit ea17e7414bc62e8d3bde8d08e3df1d921c518c17 upstream.
    
    The symbol jiffies is created in the linker script as an alias to
    jiffies_64.  Unfortunately this is done outside any section, and
    apparently GNU ld 2.21 doesn't carry the section with it, so we end up
    with an absolute symbol and therefore a broken kernel.
    
    Add jiffies and jiffies_64 to the whitelist.
    
    The most disturbing bit with this discovery is that it shows that we
    have had multiple linker bugs in this area crossing multiple
    generations, and have been silently building bad kernels for some time.

    x86-32, relocs: Whitelist more symbols for ld bug workaround
    
    commit fd952815307f0f272bf49fd364a7fd2f9992bc42 upstream.
    
    As noted in checkin:
    
    a3e854d95 x86, relocs: Workaround for binutils 2.22.52.0.1 section bug
    
    ld version 2.22.52.0.[12] can incorrectly promote relative symbols to
    absolute, if the output section they appear in is otherwise empty.
    
    Since checkin:
    
    6520fe55 x86, realmode: 16-bit real-mode code support for relocs tool
    
    we actually check for this and error out rather than silently creating
    a kernel which will malfunction if relocated.
    
    Ingo found a configuration in which __start_builtin_fw triggered the
    warning.
    
    Go through the linker script sources and look for more symbols that
    could plausibly get bogusly promoted to absolute, and add them to the
    whitelist.
    
    In general, if the following error triggers:
    
            Invalid absolute R_386_32 relocation: <symbol>
    
    ... then we should verify that <symbol> is really meant to be
    relocated, and add it and any related symbols manually to the S_REL
    regexp.
    
    Please note that 6520fe55 does not introduce the error, only the check
    for the error -- without 6520fe55 this version of ld will simply
    produce a corrupt kernel if CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is set on x86-32.

    GNU ld 2.22.52.0.1 has a bug that it blindly changes symbols from

    This turns the symbols __init_begin and __init_end into absolute

    x86, realmode: 16-bit real-mode code support for relocs tool
    
    commit 6520fe5564acf07ade7b18a1272db1184835c487 upstream.
    
    A new option is added to the relocs tool called '--realmode'.
    This option causes the generation of 16-bit segment relocations
    and 32-bit linear relocations for the real-mode code. When
    the real-mode code is moved to the low-memory during kernel
    initialization, these relocation entries can be used to
    relocate the code properly.
    
    In the assembly code 16-bit segment relocations must be relative
    to the 'real_mode_seg' absolute symbol. Linear relocations must be

    xen: do not map the same GSI twice in PVHVM guests.
    
    commit 68c2c39a76b094e9b2773e5846424ea674bf2c46 upstream.
    
    PV on HVM guests map GSIs into event channels. At restore time the
    event channels are resumed by restore_pirqs.
    
    Device drivers might try to register the same GSI again through ACPI at
    restore time, but the GSI has already been mapped and bound by
    restore_pirqs. This patch detects these situations and avoids
     mapping the same GSI multiple times.
    
    Without this patch we get:
    (XEN) irq.c:2235: dom4: pirq 23 or emuirq 28 already mapped
    and waste a pirq.

    spi/spi-fsl-spi: reference correct pdata in fsl_spi_cs_control
    
    commit 067aa4815a9bc12a569d8a06afef50ba5773afbf upstream.
    
    Commit 178db7d3, "spi: Fix device unregistration when unregistering
    the bus master", changed spi device initialization of dev.parent pointer
    to be the master's device pointer instead of his parent.
    
    This introduced a bug in spi-fsl-spi, since its usage of spi device
    pointer was not updated accordingly. This was later fixed by commit
    5039a86, "spi/mpc83xx: fix NULL pdata dereference bug", but it missed
    another spot on fsl_spi_cs_control function where we also need to update
    usage of spi device pointer. This change address that.

    drm/i915: [GEN7] Use HW scheduler for fixed function shaders
    
    commit a1e969e0332de7a430e62822cee8f2ec8d83cd7c upstream.
    
    This originally started as a patch from Bernard as a way of simply
    setting the VS scheduler. After submitting the RFC patch, we decided to
    also modify the DS scheduler. To be most explicit, I've made the patch
    explicitly set all scheduler modes, and included the defines for other
    modes (in case someone feels frisky later).
    
    The rest of the story gets a bit weird. The first version of the patch
    showed an almost unbelievable performance improvement. Since rebasing my
    branch it appears the performance improvement has gone, unfortunately.
    But setting these bits seem to be the right thing to do given that the
    docs describe corruption that can occur with the default settings.
    
    In summary, I am seeing no more perf improvements (or regressions) in my
    limited testing, but we believe this should be set to prevent rendering
    corruption, therefore cc stable.
    
    v1: Clear bit 4 also (Ken + Eugeni)
    Do a full clear + set of the bits we want (Me).

    commit 9adab8b5a7fde248504f484e197589f3e3c922e2 upstream.
    
    Currently the code re-reads PCH_IIR during the hotplug interrupt
    processing. Not only is this a wasted read, but introduces a potential
    for handling a spurious interrupt as we then may not clear all the
    interrupts processed (since the re-read IIR may contains more interrupts
    asserted than we clear using the result of the original read).

    xhci: Add new short TX quirk for Fresco Logic host.
    
    commit 1530bbc6272d9da1e39ef8e06190d42c13a02733 upstream.
    
    Sergio reported that when he recorded audio from a USB headset mic
    plugged into the USB 3.0 port on his ASUS N53SV-DH72, the audio sounded
    "robotic".  When plugged into the USB 2.0 port under EHCI on the same
    laptop, the audio sounded fine.  The device is:
    
    Bus 002 Device 004: ID 046d:0a0c Logitech, Inc. Clear Chat Comfort USB Headset
    
    The problem was tracked down to the Fresco Logic xHCI host controller
    not correctly reporting short transfers on isochronous IN endpoints.
    The driver would submit a 96 byte transfer, the device would only send
    88 or 90 bytes, and the xHCI host would report the transfer had a
    "successful" completion code, with an untransferred buffer length of 8
    or 6 bytes.
    
    The successful completion code and non-zero untransferred length is a
    contradiction.  The xHCI host is supposed to only mark a transfer as
    successful if all the bytes are transferred.  Otherwise, the transfer
    should be marked with a short packet completion code.  Without the EHCI
    bus trace, we wouldn't know whether the xHCI driver should trust the
    completion code or the untransferred length.  With it, we know to trust
    the untransferred length.
    
    Add a new xHCI quirk for the Fresco Logic host controller.  If a
    transfer is reported as successful, but the untransferred length is
    non-zero, print a warning.  For the Fresco Logic host, change the
    completion code to COMP_SHORT_TX and process the transfer like a short
    transfer.
    
    This should be backported to stable kernels that contain the commit
    f5182b4155b9d686c5540a6822486400e34ddd98 "xhci: Disable MSI for some
    Fresco Logic hosts."  That commit was marked for stable kernels as old

    commit 33b2831ac870d50cc8e01c317b07fb1e69c13fe1 upstream.
    
    When the xHCI driver needs to clean up memory (perhaps due to a failed
    register restore on resume from S3 or resume from S4), it needs to reset
    the number of reserved TRBs on the command ring to zero.  Otherwise,
    several resume cycles (about 30) with a UAS device attached will
    continually increment the number of reserved TRBs, until all command
    submissions fail because there isn't enough room on the command ring.

    usb-xhci: Handle COMP_TX_ERR for isoc tds
    
    commit 9c745995ae5c4ff787f34a359de908facc11ee00 upstream.
    
    While testing unplugging an UVC HD webcam with usb-redirection (so through
    usbdevfs), my userspace usb-redir code was getting a value of -1 in
    iso_frame_desc[n].status, which according to Documentation/usb/error-codes.txt
    is not a valid value.
    
    The source of this -1 is the default case in xhci-ring.c:process_isoc_td()
    adding a kprintf there showed the value of trb_comp_code to be COMP_TX_ERR
    in this case, so this patch adds handling for that completion code to
    process_isoc_td().
    
    This was observed and tested with the following xhci controller:
    1033:0194 NEC Corporation uPD720200 USB 3.0 Host Controller (rev 04)
    
    Note: I also wonder if setting frame->status to -1 (-EPERM) is the best we can
    do, but since I cannot come up with anything better I've left that as is.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.36, which contain the

    commit 51c9e6c7732b67769c0a514d31f505e49fa82dd4 upstream.
    
    If the user chooses to say "no" to CONFIG_USB_XHCI_HCD on a system
    with an Intel Panther Point chipset, the PCI quirks code or the EHCI
    driver will switch the ports over to the xHCI host, but the xHCI driver
    will never load.  The ports will be powered off and seem "dead" to the
    user.
    
    Fix this by only switching the ports over if CONFIG_USB_XHCI_HCD is
    either compiled in, or compiled as a module.

    xhci: Add Lynx Point to list of Intel switchable hosts.
    
    commit 1c12443ab8eba71a658fae4572147e56d1f84f66 upstream.
    
    The upcoming Intel Lynx Point chipset includes an xHCI host controller
    that can have ports switched from the EHCI host controller, just like
    the Intel Panther Point xHCI host.  This time, ports from both EHCI
    hosts can be switched to the xHCI host controller.  The PCI config
    registers to do the port switching are in the exact same place in the
    xHCI PCI configuration registers, with the same semantics.
    
    Hooray for shipping patches for next-gen hardware before the current gen
    hardware is even available for purchase!
    
    This patch should be backported to stable kernels as old as 3.0,

    usb: gadget: fsl_udc_core: dTD's next dtd pointer need to be updated once written
    
    commit 4d0947dec4db1224354e2f6f00ae22ce38e62a43 upstream.
    
    dTD's next dtd pointer need to be updated once CPU writes it, or this
    request may not be handled by controller, then host will get NAK from
    device forever.
    
    This problem occurs when there is a request is handling, we need to add
    a new request to dTD list, if this new request is added before the current
    one is finished, the new request is intended to added as next dtd pointer
    at current dTD, but without wmb(), the dTD's next dtd pointer may not be
    updated when the controller reads it. In that case, the controller will
    still get Terminate Bit is 1 at dTD's next dtd pointer, that means there is
    no next request, then this new request is missed by controller.

    USB: ohci-at91: add a reset function to fix race condition
    
    commit 07e4e556eff4938eb2edf2591de3aa7d7fb82b52 upstream.
    
    A possible race condition appears because we are not initializing
    the ohci->regs before calling usb_hcd_request_irqs().
    We move the call to ohci_init() in hcd->driver->reset() instead of
    hcd->driver->start() to fix this.
    This was experienced when we share the same IRQ line between OHCI and EHCI
    controllers.

    SCSI: hpsa: Fix problem with MSA2xxx devices
    
    commit 9bc3711cbb67ac620bf09b4a147cbab45b2c36c0 upstream.
    
    Upgraded firmware on Smart Array P7xx (and some others) made them show up as
    SCSI revision 5 devices and this caused the driver to fail to map MSA2xxx
    logical drives to the correct bus/target/lun.  A symptom of this would be that
    the target ID of the logical drives as presented by the external storage array
    is ignored, and all such logical drives are assigned to target zero,
    differentiated only by LUN.  Some multipath software reportedly does not deal
    well with this behavior, failing to recognize different paths to the same
    device as such.

    This implied a reference counting bug and the problem happened during
    mbind().
    
    mbind() applies a new memory policy to a range and uses mbind_range() to
    merge existing VMAs or split them as necessary.  In the event of splits,
    mpol_dup() will allocate a new struct mempolicy and maintain existing
    reference counts whose rules are documented in
    Documentation/vm/numa_memory_policy.txt .
    
    The problem occurs with shared memory policies.  The vm_op->set_policy
    increments the reference count if necessary and split_vma() and
    vma_merge() have already handled the existing reference counts.
    However, policy_vma() screws it up by replacing an existing
    vma->vm_policy with one that potentially has the wrong reference count
    leading to a premature free.  This patch removes the damage caused by
    policy_vma().
    
    With this patch applied Dave's trinity tool runs an mbind test for 5
    minutes without error.  /proc/slabinfo reported that there are no
    numa_policy or shared_policy_node objects allocated after the test
    completed and the shared memory region was deleted.

    workqueue: skip nr_running sanity check in worker_enter_idle() if trustee is active
    
    commit 544ecf310f0e7f51fa057ac2a295fc1b3b35a9d3 upstream.
    
    worker_enter_idle() has WARN_ON_ONCE() which triggers if nr_running
    isn't zero when every worker is idle.  This can trigger spuriously
    while a cpu is going down due to the way trustee sets %WORKER_ROGUE
    and zaps nr_running.
    
    It first sets %WORKER_ROGUE on all workers without updating
    nr_running, releases gcwq->lock, schedules, regrabs gcwq->lock and
    then zaps nr_running.  If the last running worker enters idle
    inbetween, it would see stale nr_running which hasn't been zapped yet
    and trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE().
    
    Fix it by performing the sanity check iff the trustee is idle.

    swap: don't do discard if no discard option added
    
    commit 052b1987faca3606109d88d96bce124851f7c4c2 upstream.
    
    When swapon() was not passed the SWAP_FLAG_DISCARD option, sys_swapon()
    will still perform a discard operation.  This can cause problems if
    discard is slow or buggy.
    
    Reverse the order of the check so that a discard operation is performed
    only if the sys_swapon() caller is attempting to enable discard.

    commit f15b9000eb1d09bbaa4b0a6b2089d7e1f64e84b3 upstream.
    
    UML uses the _PAGE_NEWPAGE flag to mark pages which are not jet
    installed on the host side using mmap().
    pte_same() has to ignore this flag, otherwise unuse_pte_range()
    is unable to unuse the page because two identical

    match and swapoff() would never return.

    HID: logitech: read all 32 bits of report type bitfield
    
    commit 44d27f7dfedd9aadc082cda31462f6600f56e4ec upstream.
    
    On big-endian systems (e.g., Apple PowerBook), trying to use a
    logitech wireless mouse with the Logitech Unifying Receiver does not
    work with v3.2 and later kernels.  The device doesn't show up in
    /dev/input.  Older kernels work fine.
    
    That is because the new hid-logitech-dj driver claims the device.  The
    device arrival notification appears:
    
            20 00 41 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
    
    and we read the report_types bitfield (02 00 00 00) to find out what
    kind of device it is.  Unfortunately the driver only reads the first 8
    bits and treats that value as a 32-bit little-endian number, so on a
    powerpc the report type seems to be 0x02000000 and is not recognized.
    
    Even on little-endian machines, connecting a media center remote
    control (report type 00 01 00 00) with this driver loaded would
    presumably fail for the same reason.
    
    Fix both problems by using get_unaligned_le32() to read all four
    bytes, which is a little clearer anyway.  After this change, the
    wireless mouse works on Hugo's PowerBook again.
    
    Based on a patch by Nestor Lopez Casado.

    usbhid: prevent deadlock during timeout
    
    commit 8815bb09af21316aeb5f8948b24ac62181670db2 upstream.
    
    On some HCDs usb_unlink_urb() can directly call the
    completion handler. That limits the spinlocks that can
    be taken in the handler to locks not held while calling
    usb_unlink_urb()
    To prevent a race with resubmission, this patch exposes
    usbcore's infrastructure for blocking submission, uses it
    and so drops the lock without causing a race in usbhid.

    KEYS: Use the compat keyctl() syscall wrapper on Sparc64 for Sparc32 compat
    
    commit 45de6767dc51358a188f75dc4ad9dfddb7fb9480 upstream.
    
    Use the 32-bit compat keyctl() syscall wrapper on Sparc64 for Sparc32 binary
    compatibility.
    
    Without this, keyctl(KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE_IOV) is liable to malfunction as it
    uses an iovec array read from userspace - though the kernel should survive this
    as it checks pointers and sizes anyway.
    
    I think all the other keyctl() function should just work, provided (a) the top
    32-bits of each 64-bit argument register are cleared prior to invoking the
    syscall routine, and the 32-bit address space is right at the 0-end of the
    64-bit address space.  Most of the arguments are 32-bit anyway, and so for
    those clearing is not required.

    powerpc: Fix broken cpu_idle_wait() implementation
    
    commit 9cd75e13de2dcf32ecc21c7f277cff3c0ced059e upstream.
    
    commit 771dae818 (powerpc/cpuidle: Add cpu_idle_wait() to allow
    switching of idle routines) implemented cpu_idle_wait() for powerpc.
    
    The changelog says:
     "The equivalent routine for x86 is in arch/x86/kernel/process.c
      but the powerpc implementation is different.":
    
    Unfortunately the changelog is completely useless as it does not tell
    _WHY_ it is different.
    
    Aside of being different the implementation is patently wrong.
    
    The rescheduling IPI is async. That means that there is no guarantee,
    that the other cores have executed the IPI when cpu_idle_wait()
    returns. But that's the whole purpose of this function: to guarantee
    that no CPU uses the old idle handler anymore.
    
    Use the smp_functional_call() based implementation, which fulfils the
    requirements.

    SCSI: mpt2sas: Fix for panic happening because of improper memory allocation
    
    commit e42fafc25fa86c61824e8d4c5e7582316415d24f upstream.
    
    The ioc->pfacts member in the IOC structure is getting set to zero
    following a call to _base_get_ioc_facts due to the memset in that routine.
    So if the ioc->pfacts was read after a host reset, there would be a NULL
    pointer dereference. The routine _base_get_ioc_facts is called from context
    of host reset.  The problem in _base_get_ioc_facts  is the size of
    Mpi2IOCFactsReply is 64, whereas the sizeof "struct mpt2sas_facts" is 60,
    so there is a four byte overflow resulting from the memset.
    
    Also, there is memset in _base_get_port_facts using the incorrect structure,
    it should be "struct mpt2sas_port_facts" instead of Mpi2PortFactsReply.

    s390/pfault: fix task state race
    
    commit d5e50a51ccbda36b379aba9d1131a852eb908dda upstream.
    
    When setting the current task state to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE this can
    race with a different cpu. The other cpu could set the task state after
    it inspected it (while it was still TASK_RUNNING) to TASK_RUNNING which
    would change the state from TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE to TASK_RUNNING again.
    
    This race was always present in the pfault interrupt code but didn't
    cause anything harmful before commit f2db2e6c "[S390] pfault: cpu hotplug
    vs missing completion interrupts" which relied on the fact that after
    setting the task state to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE the task would really
    sleep.
    Since this is not necessarily the case the result may be a list corruption
    of the pfault_list or, as observed, a use-after-free bug while trying to
    access the task_struct of a task which terminated itself already.
    
    To fix this, we need to get a reference of the affected task when receiving
    the initial pfault interrupt and add special handling if we receive yet
    another initial pfault interrupt when the task is already enqueued in the
    pfault list.

    Fix blocking allocations called very early during bootup
    
    commit 31a67102f4762df5544bc2dfb34a931233d2a5b2 upstream.
    
    During early boot, when the scheduler hasn't really been fully set up,
    we really can't do blocking allocations because with certain (dubious)
    configurations the "might_resched()" calls can actually result in
    scheduling events.
    
    We could just make such users always use GFP_ATOMIC, but quite often the
    code that does the allocation isn't really aware of the fact that the
    scheduler isn't up yet, and forcing that kind of random knowledge on the
    initialization code is just annoying and not good for anybody.
    
    And we actually have a the 'gfp_allowed_mask' exactly for this reason:
    it's just that the kernel init sequence happens to set it to allow
    blocking allocations much too early.
    
    So move the 'gfp_allowed_mask' initialization from 'start_kernel()'
    (which is some of the earliest init code, and runs with preemption
    disabled for good reasons) into 'kernel_init()'.  kernel_init() is run
    in the newly created thread that will become the 'init' process, as
    opposed to the early startup code that runs within the context of what
    will be the first idle thread.
    
    So by the time we reach 'kernel_init()', we know that the scheduler must
    be at least limping along, because we've already scheduled from the idle
    thread into the init thread.

    cfg80211: warn if db.txt is empty with CONFIG_CFG80211_INTERNAL_REGDB
    
    commit 80007efeff0568375b08faf93c7aad65602cb97e upstream.
    
    It has happened twice now where elaborate troubleshooting has
    undergone on systems where CONFIG_CFG80211_INTERNAL_REGDB [0]
    has been set but yet net/wireless/db.txt was not updated.
    
    Despite the documentation on this it seems system integrators could
    use some more help with this, so throw out a kernel warning at boot time
    when their database is empty.
    
    This does mean that the error-prone system integrator won't likely
    realize the issue until they boot the machine but -- it does not seem
    to make sense to enable a build bug breaking random build testing.

    vfs: make AIO use the proper rw_verify_area() area helpers
    
    commit a70b52ec1aaeaf60f4739edb1b422827cb6f3893 upstream.
    
    We had for some reason overlooked the AIO interface, and it didn't use
    the proper rw_verify_area() helper function that checks (for example)
    mandatory locking on the file, and that the size of the access doesn't
    cause us to overflow the provided offset limits etc.
    
    Instead, AIO did just the security_file_permission() thing (that
    rw_verify_area() also does) directly.
    
    This fixes it to do all the proper helper functions, which not only
    means that now mandatory file locking works with AIO too, we can
    actually remove lines of code.

    Due to an errata, the PA7300LC generates a TLB miss interruption even on the
    prefetch instruction.  This means that prefetch(NULL), which is supposed to be
    a nop on linux actually generates a NULL deref fault.  Fix this by testing the

    block: don't mark buffers beyond end of disk as mapped
    
    commit 080399aaaf3531f5b8761ec0ac30ff98891e8686 upstream.
    
    Hi,
    
    We have a bug report open where a squashfs image mounted on ppc64 would
    exhibit errors due to trying to read beyond the end of the disk.  It can
    easily be reproduced by doing the following:
    
    [root@ibm-p750e-02-lp3 ~]# ls -l install.img

    Squashfs manages to read in the end block(s) of the disk during the
    mount operation.  Then, when dd reads the block device, it leads to
    block_read_full_page being called with buffers that are beyond end of
    disk, but are marked as mapped.  Thus, it would end up submitting read
    I/O against them, resulting in the errors mentioned above.  I fixed the
    problem by modifying init_page_buffers to only set the buffer mapped if
    it fell inside of i_size.
    
    Cheers,
    Jeff

    block: fix buffer overflow when printing partition UUIDs

    bio allocation failure due to bio_get_nr_vecs()
    
    commit f908ee9463b09ddd05e1c1a0111132212dc05fac upstream.
    
    The number of bio_get_nr_vecs() is passed down via bio_alloc() to
    bvec_alloc_bs(), which fails the bio allocation if
    nr_iovecs > BIO_MAX_PAGES. For the underlying caller this causes an
    unexpected bio allocation failure.
    Limiting to queue_max_segments() is not sufficient, as max_segments
    also might be very large.

    tilegx: enable SYSCALL_WRAPPERS support
    
    commit e6d9668e119af44ae5bcd5f1197174531458afe3 upstream.
    
    Some discussion with the glibc mailing lists revealed that this was
    necessary for 64-bit platforms with MIPS-like sign-extension rules
    for 32-bit values.  The original symptom was that passing (uid_t)-1 to
    setreuid() was failing in programs linked -pthread because of the "setxid"
    mechanism for passing setxid-type function arguments to the syscall code.
    SYSCALL_WRAPPERS handles ensuring that all syscall arguments end up with
    proper sign-extension and is thus the appropriate fix for this problem.
    
    On other platforms (s390, powerpc, sparc64, and mips) this was fixed
    in 2.6.28.6.  The general issue is tracked as CVE-2009-0029.
