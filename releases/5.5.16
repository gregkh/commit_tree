    mm: mempolicy: require at least one nodeid for MPOL_PREFERRED
    
    commit aa9f7d5172fac9bf1f09e678c35e287a40a7b7dd upstream.
    
    Using an empty (malformed) nodelist that is not caught during mount option
    parsing leads to a stack-out-of-bounds access.
    
    The option string that was used was: "mpol=prefer:,".  However,
    MPOL_PREFERRED requires a single node number, which is not being provided
    here.
    
    Add a check that 'nodes' is not empty after parsing for MPOL_PREFERRED's
    nodeid.

    padata: always acquire cpu_hotplug_lock before pinst->lock
    
    commit 38228e8848cd7dd86ccb90406af32de0cad24be3 upstream.
    
    lockdep complains when padata's paths to update cpumasks via CPU hotplug
    and sysfs are both taken:
    
      # echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
      # echo ff > /sys/kernel/pcrypt/pencrypt/parallel_cpumask
    
      ======================================================
      WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected
      5.4.0-rc8-padata-cpuhp-v3+ #1 Not tainted
      ------------------------------------------------------
      bash/205 is trying to acquire lock:
      ffffffff8286bcd0 (cpu_hotplug_lock.rw_sem){++++}, at: padata_set_cpumask+0x2b/0x120

      which lock already depends on the new lock.
    
    padata doesn't take cpu_hotplug_lock and pinst->lock in a consistent
    order.  Which should be first?  CPU hotplug calls into padata with
    cpu_hotplug_lock already held, so it should have priority.

    net/smc: fix cleanup for linkgroup setup failures
    
    commit 51e3dfa8906ace90c809235b3d3afebc166b6433 upstream.
    
    If an SMC connection to a certain peer is setup the first time,
    a new linkgroup is created. In case of setup failures, such a
    linkgroup is unusable and should disappear. As a first step the
    linkgroup is removed from the linkgroup list in smc_lgr_forget().
    
    There are 2 problems:
    smc_listen_decline() might be called before linkgroup creation
    resulting in a crash due to calling smc_lgr_forget() with
    parameter NULL.
    If a setup failure occurs after linkgroup creation, the connection
    is never unregistered from the linkgroup, preventing linkgroup
    freeing.
    
    This patch introduces an enhanced smc_lgr_cleanup_early() function
    which
    * contains a linkgroup check for early smc_listen_decline()
      invocations
    * invokes smc_conn_free() to guarantee unregistering of the
      connection.
    * schedules fast linkgroup removal of the unusable linkgroup
    
    And the unused function smcd_conn_free() is removed from smc_core.h.

    net: Fix Tx hash bound checking
    
    commit 6e11d1578fba8d09d03a286740ffcf336d53928c upstream.
    
    Fixes the lower and upper bounds when there are multiple TCs and
    traffic is on the the same TC on the same device.
    
    The lower bound is represented by 'qoffset' and the upper limit for
    hash value is 'qcount + qoffset'. This gives a clean Rx to Tx queue
    mapping when there are multiple TCs, as the queue indices for upper TCs
    will be offset by 'qoffset'.

    i2c: i801: Do not add ICH_RES_IO_SMI for the iTCO_wdt device
    
    commit 04bbb97d1b732b2d197f103c5818f5c214a4cf81 upstream.
    
    Martin noticed that nct6775 driver does not load properly on his system
    in v5.4+ kernels. The issue was bisected to commit b84398d6d7f9 ("i2c:
    i801: Use iTCO version 6 in Cannon Lake PCH and beyond") but it is
    likely not the culprit because the faulty code has been in the driver
    already since commit 9424693035a5 ("i2c: i801: Create iTCO device on
    newer Intel PCHs"). So more likely some commit that added PCI IDs of
    recent chipsets made the driver to create the iTCO_wdt device on Martins
    system.
    
    The issue was debugged to be PCI configuration access to the PMC device
    that is not present. This returns all 1's when read and this caused the
    iTCO_wdt driver to accidentally request resourses used by nct6775.
    
    It turns out that the SMI resource is only required for some ancient
    systems, not the ones supported by this driver. For this reason do not
    populate the SMI resource at all and drop all the related code. The
    driver now always populates the main I/O resource and only in case of SPT
    (Intel Sunrisepoint) compatible devices it adds another resource for the
    NO_REBOOT bit. These two resources are of different types so
    platform_get_resource() used by the iTCO_wdt driver continues to find
    the both resources at index 0.

    tcp: fix TFO SYNACK undo to avoid double-timestamp-undo
    
    commit dad8cea7add96a353fa1898b5ccefbb72da66f29 upstream.
    
    In a rare corner case the new logic for undo of SYNACK RTO could
    result in triggering the warning in tcp_fastretrans_alert() that says:
            WARN_ON(tp->retrans_out != 0);
    
    The warning looked like:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1 at net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:2818 tcp_ack+0x13e0/0x3270
    
    The sequence that tickles this bug is:
     - Fast Open server receives TFO SYN with data, sends SYNACK
     - (client receives SYNACK and sends ACK, but ACK is lost)
     - server app sends some data packets
     - (N of the first data packets are lost)
     - server receives client ACK that has a TS ECR matching first SYNACK,
       and also SACKs suggesting the first N data packets were lost
        - server performs TS undo of SYNACK RTO, then immediately
          enters recovery
        - buggy behavior then performed a *second* undo that caused
          the connection to be in CA_Open with retrans_out != 0
    
    Basically, the incoming ACK packet with SACK blocks causes us to first
    undo the cwnd reduction from the SYNACK RTO, but then immediately
    enters fast recovery, which then makes us eligible for undo again. And
    then tcp_rcv_synrecv_state_fastopen() accidentally performs an undo
    using a "mash-up" of state from two different loss recovery phases: it
    uses the timestamp info from the ACK of the original SYNACK, and the
    undo_marker from the fast recovery.
    
    This fix refines the logic to only invoke the tcp_try_undo_loss()
    inside tcp_rcv_synrecv_state_fastopen() if the connection is still in
    CA_Loss.  If peer SACKs triggered fast recovery, then
    tcp_rcv_synrecv_state_fastopen() can't safely undo.

    The issue happens when wait_event_interruptible_timeout() returns a value
    <= 0.
    
    In that case, the pq is left on the list. The code continues sending
    packets and potentially can complete the current request with the pq still
    on the dmawait list provided no descriptor shortage is seen.
    
    If the pq is torn down in that state, the sdma interrupt handler could
    find the now freed pq on the list with list corruption or memory
    corruption resulting.
    
    Fix by adding a flush routine to ensure that the pq is never on a list
    after processing a request.
    
    A follow-up patch series will address issues with seqlock surfaced in:
    https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200320003129.GP20941@ziepe.ca
    
    The seqlock use for sdma will then be converted to a spin lock since the
    list_empty() doesn't need the protection afforded by the sequence lock
    currently in use.

    commit 498b577660f08cef5d9e78e0ed6dcd4c0939e98c upstream.
    
    Fix the handling of sendmsg() with MSG_WAITALL for userspace to round the
    timeout for when a signal occurs up to at least two jiffies as a 1 jiffy
    timeout may end up being effectively 0 if jiffies wraps at the wrong time.

    iwlwifi: dbg: don't abort if sending DBGC_SUSPEND_RESUME fails
    
    commit 699b760bd29edba736590fffef7654cb079c753e upstream.
    
    If the firmware is in a bad state or not initialized fully, sending
    the DBGC_SUSPEND_RESUME command fails but we can still collect logs.
    
    Instead of aborting the entire dump process, simply ignore the error.
    By removing the last callpoint that was checking the return value, we
    can also convert the function to return void.

    iwlwifi: yoyo: don't add TLV offset when reading FIFOs
    
    commit a5688e600e78f9fc68102bf0fe5c797fc2826abe upstream.
    
    The TLV offset is only used to read registers, while the offset used for
    the FIFO addresses are hard coded in the driver and not given by the
    TLV.
    
    If we try to apply the TLV offset when reading the FIFOs, we'll read
    from invalid addresses, causing the driver to hang.

    Revert "dm: always call blk_queue_split() in dm_process_bio()"
    
    commit 120c9257f5f19e5d1e87efcbb5531b7cd81b7d74 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit effd58c95f277744f75d6e08819ac859dbcbd351.
    
    blk_queue_split() is causing excessive IO splitting -- because
    blk_max_size_offset() depends on 'chunk_sectors' limit being set and
    if it isn't (as is the case for DM targets!) it falls back to
    splitting on a 'max_sectors' boundary regardless of offset.
    
    "Fix" this by reverting back to _not_ using blk_queue_split() in
    dm_process_bio() for normal IO (reads and writes).  Long-term fix is
    still TBD but it should focus on training blk_max_size_offset() to
    call into a DM provided hook (to call DM's max_io_len()).
    
    Test results from simple misaligned IO test on 4-way dm-striped device
    with chunksize of 128K and stripesize of 512K:

    power: supply: axp288_charger: Add special handling for HP Pavilion x2 10
    
    commit 9c80662a74cd2a5d1113f5c69d027face963a556 upstream.
    
    Some HP Pavilion x2 10 models use an AXP288 for charging and fuel-gauge.
    We use a native power_supply / PMIC driver in this case, because on most
    models with an AXP288 the ACPI AC / Battery code is either completely
    missing or relies on custom / proprietary ACPI OpRegions which Linux
    does not implement.
    
    The native drivers mostly work fine, but there are 2 problems:
    
    1. These model uses a Type-C connector for charging which the AXP288 does
    not support. As long as a Type-A charger (which uses the USB data pins for
    charger type detection) is used everything is fine. But if a Type-C
    charger is used (such as the charger shipped with the device) then the
    charger is not recognized.
    
    So we end up slowly discharging the device even though a charger is
    connected, because we are limiting the current from the charger to 500mA.
    To make things worse this happens with the device's official charger.
    
    Looking at the ACPI tables HP has "solved" the problem of the AXP288 not
    being able to recognize Type-C chargers by simply always programming the
    input-current-limit at 3000mA and relying on a Vhold setting of 4.7V
    (normally 4.4V) to limit the current intake if the charger cannot handle
    this.
    
    2. If no charger is connected when the machine boots then it boots with the
    vbus-path disabled. On other devices this is done when a 5V boost converter
    is active to avoid the PMIC trying to charge from the 5V boost output.
    This is done when an OTG host cable is inserted and the ID pin on the
    micro-B receptacle is pulled low, the ID pin has an ACPI event handler
    associated with it which re-enables the vbus-path when the ID pin is pulled
    high when the OTG cable is removed. The Type-C connector has no ID pin,
    there is no ID pin handler and there appears to be no 5V boost converter,
    so we end up not charging because the vbus-path is disabled, until we
    unplug the charger which automatically clears the vbus-path disable bit and
    then on the second plug-in of the adapter we start charging.
    
    The HP Pavilion x2 10 models with an AXP288 do have mostly working ACPI
    AC / Battery code which does not rely on custom / proprietary ACPI
    OpRegions. So one possible solution would be to blacklist the AXP288
    native power_supply drivers and add the HP Pavilion x2 10 with AXP288
    DMI ids to the list of devices which should use the ACPI AC / Battery
    code even though they have an AXP288 PMIC. This would require changes to
    4 files: drivers/acpi/ac.c, drivers/power/supply/axp288_charger.c,
    drivers/acpi/battery.c and drivers/power/supply/axp288_fuel_gauge.c.
    
    Beside needing adding the same DMI matches to 4 different files, this
    approach also triggers problem 2. from above, but then when suspended,
    during suspend the machine will not wakeup because the vbus path is
    disabled by the AML code when not charging, so the Vbus low-to-high
    IRQ is not triggered, the CPU never wakes up and the device does not
    charge even though the user likely things it is charging, esp. since
    the charge status LED is directly coupled to an adapter being plugged
    in and does not reflect actual charging.
    
    This could be worked by enabling vbus-path explicitly from say the
    axp288_charger driver's suspend handler.
    
    So neither situation is ideal, in both cased we need to explicitly enable
    the vbus-path to work around different variants of problem 2 above, this
    requires a quirk in the axp288_charger code.
    
    If we go the route of using the ACPI AC / Battery drivers then we need
    modifications to 3 other drivers; and we need to partially disable the
    axp288_charger code, while at the same time keeping it around to enable
    vbus-path on suspend.
    
    OTOH we can copy the hardcoding of 3A input-current-limit (we never touch
    Vhold, so that would stay at 4.7V) to the axp288_charger code, which needs
    changes regardless, then we concentrate all special handling of this
    interesting device model in the axp288_charger code. That is what this
    commit does.

    extcon: axp288: Add wakeup support
    
    commit 9c94553099efb2ba873cbdddfd416a8a09d0e5f1 upstream.
    
    On devices with an AXP288, we need to wakeup from suspend when a charger
    is plugged in, so that we can do charger-type detection and so that the
    axp288-charger driver, which listens for our extcon events, can configure
    the input-current-limit accordingly.

    We changed these sysfs filenames:

      .../<domain:bus:dev.fn>/rescan   ->  .../<domain:bus:dev.fn>/dev_rescan
    
    and Ruslan reported [1] that this broke a userspace application.
    
    Revert these name changes so both files are named "rescan" again.
    
    Note that we have to use __ATTR() to assign custom C symbols, i.e.,
    "struct device_attribute <symbol>".

    commit b2ba9225e0313b1de631a44b7b48c109032bffec upstream.
    
    commit e03327122e2c ("pci_endpoint_test: Add 2 ioctl commands")
    uses module parameter 'irqtype' in pci_endpoint_test_set_irq()
    to check if IRQ vectors of a particular type (MSI or MSI-X or
    LEGACY) is already allocated. However with multi-function devices,
    'irqtype' will not correctly reflect the IRQ type of the PCI device.
    
    Fix it here by adding 'irqtype' for each PCI device to show the
    IRQ type of a particular PCI device.

    initramfs: restore default compression behavior
    
    [ Upstream commit 785d74ec3bbf26ac7f6e92e6e96a259aec0f107a ]
    
    Even though INITRAMFS_SOURCE kconfig option isn't set in most of
    defconfigs it is used (set) extensively by various build systems.
    Commit f26661e12765 ("initramfs: make initramfs compression choice
    non-optional") has changed default compression mode. Previously we
    compress initramfs using available compression algorithm. Now
    we don't use any compression at all by default.
    It significantly increases the image size in case of build system
    chooses embedded initramfs. Initially I faced with this issue while
    using buildroot.
    
    As of today it's not possible to set preferred compression mode
    in target defconfig as this option depends on INITRAMFS_SOURCE
    being set. Modification of all build systems either doesn't look
    like good option.
    
    Let's instead rewrite initramfs compression mode choices list
    the way that "INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_NONE" will be the last option
    in the list. In that case it will be chosen only if all other
    options (which implements any compression) are not available.

    Shutdown of firmware framebuffer has a bunch of problems.  Because
    of this the framebuffer region might still be reserved even after
    drm_fb_helper_remove_conflicting_pci_framebuffers() returned.
    
    Don't consider pci_request_region() failure for the framebuffer
    region as fatal error to workaround this issue.

    drm/amd/display: Add link_rate quirk for Apple 15" MBP 2017
    
    [ Upstream commit dec9de2ada523b344eb2428abfedf9d6cd0a0029 ]
    
    This fixes a problem found on the MacBookPro 2017 Retina panel:
    
    The panel reports 10 bpc color depth in its EDID, and the
    firmware chooses link settings at boot which support enough
    bandwidth for 10 bpc (324000 kbit/sec aka LINK_RATE_RBR2
    aka 0xc), but the DP_MAX_LINK_RATE dpcd register only reports
    2.7 Gbps (multiplier value 0xa) as possible, in direct
    contradiction of what the firmware successfully set up.
    
    This restricts the panel to 8 bpc, not providing the full
    color depth of the panel on Linux <= 5.5. Additionally, commit
    '4a8ca46bae8a ("drm/amd/display: Default max bpc to 16 for eDP")'
    introduced into Linux 5.6-rc1 will unclamp panel depth to
    its full 10 bpc, thereby requiring a eDP bandwidth for all
    modes that exceeds the bandwidth available and causes all modes
    to fail validation -> No modes for the laptop panel -> failure
    to set any mode -> Panel goes dark.
    
    This patch adds a quirk specific to the MBP 2017 15" Retina
    panel to override reported max link rate to the correct maximum
    of 0xc = LINK_RATE_RBR2 to fix the darkness and reduced display
    precision.
    
    Please apply for Linux 5.6+ to avoid regressing Apple MBP panel
    support.

    sctp: fix refcount bug in sctp_wfree
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c3e82fe159622e46e91458c1a6509c321a62820 ]
    
    We should iterate over the datamsgs to move
    all chunks(skbs) to newsk.
    
    The following case cause the bug:
    for the trouble SKB, it was in outq->transmitted list
    
    sctp_outq_sack
            sctp_check_transmitted
                    SKB was moved to outq->sacked list
            then throw away the sack queue
                    SKB was deleted from outq->sacked
    (but it was held by datamsg at sctp_datamsg_to_asoc
    So, sctp_wfree was not called here)
    
    then migrate happened
    
            sctp_for_each_tx_datachunk(
            sctp_clear_owner_w);
            sctp_assoc_migrate();
            sctp_for_each_tx_datachunk(
            sctp_set_owner_w);
    SKB was not in the outq, and was not changed to newsk
    
    finally
    
    __sctp_outq_teardown
            sctp_chunk_put (for another skb)
                    sctp_datamsg_put
                            __kfree_skb(msg->frag_list)
                                    sctp_wfree (for SKB)
            SKB->sk was still oldsk (skb->sk != asoc->base.sk).

    sctp: fix possibly using a bad saddr with a given dst
    
    [ Upstream commit 582eea230536a6f104097dd46205822005d5fe3a ]
    
    Under certain circumstances, depending on the order of addresses on the
    interfaces, it could be that sctp_v[46]_get_dst() would return a dst
    with a mismatched struct flowi.
    
    For example, if when walking through the bind addresses and the first
    one is not a match, it saves the dst as a fallback (added in
    410f03831c07), but not the flowi. Then if the next one is also not a
    match, the previous dst will be returned but with the flowi information
    for the 2nd address, which is wrong.
    
    The fix is to use a locally stored flowi that can be used for such
    attempts, and copy it to the parameter only in case it is a possible
    match, together with the corresponding dst entry.
    
    The patch updates IPv6 code mostly just to be in sync. Even though the issue
    is also present there, it fallback is not expected to work with IPv6.

    net, ip_tunnel: fix interface lookup with no key
    
    [ Upstream commit 25629fdaff2ff509dd0b3f5ff93d70a75e79e0a1 ]
    
    when creating a new ipip interface with no local/remote configuration,
    the lookup is done with TUNNEL_NO_KEY flag, making it impossible to
    match the new interface (only possible match being fallback or metada
    case interface); e.g: `ip link add tunl1 type ipip dev eth0`
    
    To fix this case, adding a flag check before the key comparison so we
    permit to match an interface with no local/remote config; it also avoids
    breaking possible userland tools relying on TUNNEL_NO_KEY flag and
    uninitialised key.
    
    context being on my side, I'm creating an extra ipip interface attached
    to the physical one, and moving it to a dedicated namespace.
