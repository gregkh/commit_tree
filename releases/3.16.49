    dm: flush queued bios when process blocks to avoid deadlock
    
    commit d67a5f4b5947aba4bfe9a80a2b86079c215ca755 upstream.
    
    Commit df2cb6daa4 ("block: Avoid deadlocks with bio allocation by
    stacking drivers") created a workqueue for every bio set and code
    in bio_alloc_bioset() that tries to resolve some low-memory deadlocks
    by redirecting bios queued on current->bio_list to the workqueue if the
    system is low on memory.  However other deadlocks (see below **) may
    happen, without any low memory condition, because generic_make_request
    is queuing bios to current->bio_list (rather than submitting them).
    
    ** the related dm-snapshot deadlock is detailed here:
    https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2016-July/msg00065.html
    
    Fix this deadlock by redirecting any bios on current->bio_list to the
    bio_set's rescue workqueue on every schedule() call.  Consequently,
    when the process blocks on a mutex, the bios queued on
    current->bio_list are dispatched to independent workqueus and they can
    complete without waiting for the mutex to be available.
    
    The structure blk_plug contains an entry cb_list and this list can contain
    arbitrary callback functions that are called when the process blocks.
    To implement this fix DM (ab)uses the onstack plug's cb_list interface
    to get its flush_current_bio_list() called at schedule() time.
    
    This fixes the snapshot deadlock - if the map method blocks,
    flush_current_bio_list() will be called and it redirects bios waiting
    on current->bio_list to appropriate workqueues.

    cpuset: PF_SPREAD_PAGE and PF_SPREAD_SLAB should be atomic flags
    
    commit 2ad654bc5e2b211e92f66da1d819e47d79a866f0 upstream.
    
    When we change cpuset.memory_spread_{page,slab}, cpuset will flip
    PF_SPREAD_{PAGE,SLAB} bit of tsk->flags for each task in that cpuset.
    This should be done using atomic bitops, but currently we don't,
    which is broken.
    
    Tetsuo reported a hard-to-reproduce kernel crash on RHEL6, which happened
    when one thread tried to clear PF_USED_MATH while at the same time another
    thread tried to flip PF_SPREAD_PAGE/PF_SPREAD_SLAB. They both operate on
    the same task.
    
    Here's the full report:
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/9/19/230
    
    To fix this, we make PF_SPREAD_PAGE and PF_SPREAD_SLAB atomic flags.

    - updated mm/slab.c. (Fengguang Wu)

    sched: add macros to define bitops for task atomic flags
    
    commit e0e5070b20e01f0321f97db4e4e174f3f6b49e50 upstream.
    
    This will simplify code when we add new flags.
    
    v3:
    - Kees pointed out that no_new_privs should never be cleared, so we
    shouldn't define task_clear_no_new_privs(). we define 3 macros instead

    commit a2b86f772227bcaf962c8b134f8d187046ac5f0e upstream.
    
    Commit 1d4457f99928 ("sched: move no_new_privs into new atomic flags")
    defined PFA_NO_NEW_PRIVS as hexadecimal value, but it is confusing
    because it is used as bit number. Redefine it as decimal bit number.
    
    Note this changes the bit position of PFA_NOW_NEW_PRIVS from 1 to 0.

    commit 1d4457f99928a968767f6405b4a1f50845aa15fd upstream.
    
    Since seccomp transitions between threads requires updates to the
    no_new_privs flag to be atomic, the flag must be part of an atomic flag
    set. This moves the nnp flag into a separate task field, and introduces
    accessors.

    netvsc: fix incorrect receive checksum offloading
    
    commit e52fed7177f74382f742c27de2cc5314790aebb6 upstream.
    
    The Hyper-V netvsc driver was looking at the incorrect status bits
    in the checksum info. It was setting the receive checksum unnecessary
    flag based on the IP header checksum being correct. The checksum
    flag is skb is about TCP and UDP checksum status. Because of this
    bug, any packet received with bad TCP checksum would be passed
    up the stack and to the application causing data corruption.
    The problem is reproducible via netcat and netem.
    
    This had a side effect of not doing receive checksum offload
    on IPv6. The driver was also also always doing checksum offload
    independent of the checksum setting done via ethtool.

    PCI: Limit config space size for Netronome NFP4000

    Like the NFP6000, the NFP4000 as an erratum where reading/writing to PCI
    config space addresses above 0x600 can cause the NFP to generate PCIe
    completion timeouts.
    
    Limit the NFP4000's PF's config space size to 0x600 bytes as is already
    done for the NFP6000.
    
    The NFP4000's VF is 0x6004 (PCI_DEVICE_ID_NETRONOME_NFP6000_VF), the same
    device ID as the NFP6000's VF.  Thus, its config space is already limited
    by the existing use of quirk_nfp6000().

    PCI: Support PCIe devices with short cfg_size
    
    commit c20aecf6963d1273d8f6d61c042b4845441ca592 upstream.
    
    If a device quirk modifies the pci_dev->cfg_size to be less than
    PCI_CFG_SPACE_EXP_SIZE (4096), but greater than PCI_CFG_SPACE_SIZE (256),
    the PCI sysfs interface truncates the readable size to PCI_CFG_SPACE_SIZE.
    
    Allow sysfs access to config space up to cfg_size, even if the device
    doesn't support the entire 4096-byte PCIe config space.
    
    Note that pci_read_config() and pci_write_config() limit access to
    dev->cfg_size even though pcie_config_attr contains 4096 (the maximum
    size).

    mm: thp: fix SMP race condition between THP page fault and MADV_DONTNEED
    
    commit ad33bb04b2a6cee6c1f99fabb15cddbf93ff0433 upstream.
    
    pmd_trans_unstable()/pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad() were
    introduced to locklessy (but atomically) detect when a pmd is a regular
    (stable) pmd or when the pmd is unstable and can infinitely transition
    from pmd_none() and pmd_trans_huge() from under us, while only holding
    the mmap_sem for reading (for writing not).
    
    While holding the mmap_sem only for reading, MADV_DONTNEED can run from
    under us and so before we can assume the pmd to be a regular stable pmd
    we need to compare it against pmd_none() and pmd_trans_huge() in an
    atomic way, with pmd_trans_unstable().  The old pmd_trans_huge() left a
    tiny window for a race.
    
    Useful applications are unlikely to notice the difference as doing
    MADV_DONTNEED concurrently with a page fault would lead to undefined
    behavior.

    commit dc295880c6752076f8b94ba3885d0bfff09e3e82 upstream.
    
    The syscall_set_return_value function of s390 negates the error argument
    before storing the value to the return register gpr2. This is incorrect,
    the seccomp code already passes the negative error value.
    Store the unmodified error value to gpr2.

    mm/swap.c: flush lru pvecs on compound page arrival
    
    commit 8f182270dfec432e93fae14f9208a6b9af01009f upstream.
    
    Currently we can have compound pages held on per cpu pagevecs, which
    leads to a lot of memory unavailable for reclaim when needed.  In the
    systems with hundreads of processors it can be GBs of memory.
    
    On of the way of reproducing the problem is to not call munmap
    explicitly on all mapped regions (i.e.  after receiving SIGTERM).  After
    that some pages (with THP enabled also huge pages) may end up on
    lru_add_pvec, example below.
    
      void main() {
      #pragma omp parallel
      {
            size_t size = 55 * 1000 * 1000; // smaller than  MEM/CPUS
            void *p = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                    MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS , -1, 0);
            if (p != MAP_FAILED)
                    memset(p, 0, size);
            //munmap(p, size); // uncomment to make the problem go away
      }
      }
    
    When we run it with THP enabled it will leave significant amount of
    memory on lru_add_pvec.  This memory will be not reclaimed if we hit
    OOM, so when we run above program in a loop:
    
            for i in `seq 100`; do ./a.out; done
    
    many processes (95% in my case) will be killed by OOM.
    
    The primary point of the LRU add cache is to save the zone lru_lock
    contention with a hope that more pages will belong to the same zone and
    so their addition can be batched.  The huge page is already a form of
    batched addition (it will add 512 worth of memory in one go) so skipping
    the batching seems like a safer option when compared to a potential
    excess in the caching which can be quite large and much harder to fix
    because lru_add_drain_all is way to expensive and it is not really clear
    what would be a good moment to call it.
    
    Similarly we can reproduce the problem on lru_deactivate_pvec by adding:
    madvise(p, size, MADV_FREE); after memset.
    
    This patch flushes lru pvecs on compound page arrival making the problem
    less severe - after applying it kill rate of above example drops to 0%,
    due to reducing maximum amount of memory held on pvec from 28MB (with
    THP) to 56kB per CPU.

    arm64: Rework valid_user_regs
    
    commit dbd4d7ca563fd0a8949718d35ce197e5642d5d9d upstream.
    
    We validate pstate using PSR_MODE32_BIT, which is part of the
    user-provided pstate (and cannot be trusted). Also, we conflate
    validation of AArch32 and AArch64 pstate values, making the code
    difficult to reason about.
    
    Instead, validate the pstate value based on the associated task. The
    task may or may not be current (e.g. when using ptrace), so this must be
    passed explicitly by callers. To avoid circular header dependencies via
    sched.h, is_compat_task is pulled out of asm/ptrace.h.
    
    To make the code possible to reason about, the AArch64 and AArch32
    validation is split into separate functions. Software must respect the
    RES0 policy for SPSR bits, and thus the kernel mirrors the hardware
    policy (RAZ/WI) for bits as-yet unallocated. When these acquire an
    architected meaning writes may be permitted (potentially with additional
    validation).

    MIPS: KVM: Fix modular KVM under QEMU
    
    commit 797179bc4fe06c89e47a9f36f886f68640b423f8 upstream.
    
    Copy __kvm_mips_vcpu_run() into unmapped memory, so that we can never
    get a TLB refill exception in it when KVM is built as a module.
    
    This was observed to happen with the host MIPS kernel running under
    QEMU, due to a not entirely transparent optimisation in the QEMU TLB
    handling where TLB entries replaced with TLBWR are copied to a separate
    part of the TLB array. Code in those pages continue to be executable,
    but those mappings persist only until the next ASID switch, even if they
    are marked global.
    
    An ASID switch happens in __kvm_mips_vcpu_run() at exception level after
    switching to the guest exception base. Subsequent TLB mapped kernel
    instructions just prior to switching to the guest trigger a TLB refill
    exception, which enters the guest exception handlers without updating
    EPC. This appears as a guest triggered TLB refill on a host kernel
    mapped (host KSeg2) address, which is not handled correctly as user
    (guest) mode accesses to kernel (host) segments always generate address
    error exceptions.

    perf/x86: Honor the architectural performance monitoring version
    
    commit 2c33645d366d13b969d936b68b9f4875b1fdddea upstream.
    
    Architectural performance monitoring, version 1, doesn't support fixed counters.
    
    Currently, even if a hypervisor advertises support for architectural
    performance monitoring version 1, perf may still try to use the fixed
    counters, as the constraints are set up based on the CPU model.
    
    This patch ensures that perf honors the architectural performance monitoring
    version returned by CPUID, and it only uses the fixed counters for version 2
    and above.
    
    (Some of the ideas in this patch came from Peter Zijlstra.)

    The power management related assembly on omaps needs to interact with
    ARM mode bootrom code, so we need to keep most of the related assembly
    in ARM mode.
    
    Turns out this error is because of missing ENDPROC for assembly code
    as suggested by Stephen Boyd <sboyd@codeaurora.org>. Let's fix the
    problem by adding ENDPROC in two places to sleep34xx.S.
    
    Let's also remove the now duplicate custom code for mode switching.
    This has been unnecessary since commit 6ebbf2ce437b ("ARM: convert
    all "mov.* pc, reg" to "bx reg" for ARMv6+").
    
    And let's also remove the comments about local variables, they are
    now just confusing after the ENDPROC.
    
    The reason why ENDPROC makes a difference is it sets .type and then
    the compiler knows what to do with the thumb bit as explained at:

    Input: ads7846 - correct the value got from SPI
    
    commit 879f2fea8a5a748bcbf98d2cdce9139c045505d3 upstream.
    
    According to the touch controller spec, SPI return a 16 bit value, only 12
    bits are valid, they are bit[14-3].
    
    The value of MISO and MOSI can be configured when SPI is in idle mode.
    Currently this touch driver assumes the SPI bus sets the MOSI and MISO in
    low level when SPI bus is in idle mode. So the bit[15] of the value got
    from SPI bus is always 0. But when SPI bus congfigures the MOSI and MISO in
    high level during the SPI idle mode, the bit[15] of the value get from SPI
    is always 1. If bit[15] is not masked, we may get the wrong value.
    
    Mask the invalid bit to make sure the correct value gets returned.
    Regardless of the SPI bus idle configuration.

      another RX channel is receiving data, the CPPI will lockup.
    
      To workaround the issue, do not set the CPPI TD bit. The steps before
      this point ensures the CPPI channel will be torn down properly.

    x86/efi: Avoid triple faults during EFI mixed mode calls
    
    commit 96738c69a7fcdbf0d7c9df0c8a27660011e82a7b upstream.
    
    Andy pointed out that if an NMI or MCE is received while we're in the
    middle of an EFI mixed mode call a triple fault will occur. This can
    happen, for example, when issuing an EFI mixed mode call while running
    perf.
    
    The reason for the triple fault is that we execute the mixed mode call
    in 32-bit mode with paging disabled but with 64-bit kernel IDT handlers
    installed throughout the call.
    
    At Andy's suggestion, stop playing the games we currently do at runtime,
    such as disabling paging and installing a 32-bit GDT for __KERNEL_CS. We
    can simply switch to the __KERNEL32_CS descriptor before invoking
    firmware services, and run in compatibility mode. This way, if an
    NMI/MCE does occur the kernel IDT handler will execute correctly, since
    it'll jump to __KERNEL_CS automatically.
    
    However, this change is only possible post-ExitBootServices(). Before
    then the firmware "owns" the machine and expects for its 32-bit IDT
    handlers to be left intact to service interrupts, etc.
    
    So, we now need to distinguish between early boot and runtime
    invocations of EFI services. During early boot, we need to restore the
    GDT that the firmware expects to be present. We can only jump to the
    __KERNEL32_CS code segment for mixed mode calls after ExitBootServices()
    has been invoked.
    
    A liberal sprinkling of comments in the thunking code should make the
    differences in early and late environments more apparent.

    Revert "ACPI / EC: Add support to disallow QR_EC to be issued before completing previous QR_EC"
    
    commit df9ff91801da603079018f21a9412385b62f0f8e upstream.
    
    It is reported that the following commit breaks Samsung hardware:
     Commit: 558e4736f2e1b0e6323adf7a5e4df77ed6cfc1a4.
     Subject: ACPI / EC: Add support to disallow QR_EC to be issued before
              completing previous QR_EC
    
    Which means the Samsung behavior conflicts with the Acer behavior.
    
    1. Samsung may behave like:
       [ +event 1 ] SCI_EVT set
       [ +event 2 ] SCI_EVT set
                                  write QR_EC
                                  read event
       [ -event 1 ] SCI_EVT clear
       Without the above commit, Samsung can work:
       [ +event 1 ] SCI_EVT set
       [ +event 2 ] SCI_EVT set
                                  write QR_EC
                                  CAN prepare next QR_EC as SCI_EVT=1
                                  read event
       [ -event 1 ] SCI_EVT clear
                                  write QR_EC
                                  read event
       [ -event 2 ] SCI_EVT clear
       With the above commit, Samsung cannot work:

                                  read event
       [ -event 1 ] SCI_EVT clear
                                  CANNOT prepare next QR_EC as SCI_EVT=0
    2. Acer may behave like:
       [ +event 1 ] SCI_EVT set
       [ +event 2 ]
                                  write QR_EC
                                  read event
       [ -event 1 ] SCI_EVT clear
       [ +event 2 ] SCI_EVT set
       Without the above commit, Acer cannot work when there is only 1 event:
       [ +event 1 ] SCI_EVT set
                                  write QR_EC
                                  can prepared next QR_EC as SCI_EVT=1
                                  read event
       [ -event 1 ] SCI_EVT clear
                                  CANNOT write QR_EC as SCI_EVT=0
       With the above commit, Acer can work:
       [ +event 1 ] SCI_EVT set
       [ +event 2 ]
                                  write QR_EC
                                  read event
       [ -event 1 ] SCI_EVT set
                                  can prepare next QR_EC because SCI_EVT=0
                                  CAN write QR_EC as SCI_EVT=1
    
    Since Acer can also work with only the following commit applied:

    net sched filters: fix notification of filter delete with proper handle
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ee7837449b3d6f0fcf9132c6b5e5aaa58cc67d4 ]
    
    Daniel says:
    
    While trying out [1][2], I noticed that tc monitor doesn't show the
    correct handle on delete:
    
    $ tc monitor
    qdisc clsact ffff: dev eno1 parent ffff:fff1
    filter dev eno1 ingress protocol all pref 49152 bpf handle 0x2a [...]
    deleted filter dev eno1 ingress protocol all pref 49152 bpf handle 0xf3be0c80
    
    some context to explain the above:
    The user identity of any tc filter is represented by a 32-bit
    identifier encoded in tcm->tcm_handle. Example 0x2a in the bpf filter
    above. A user wishing to delete, get or even modify a specific filter
    uses this handle to reference it.
    Every classifier is free to provide its own semantics for the 32 bit handle.
    Example: classifiers like u32 use schemes like 800:1:801 to describe
    the semantics of their filters represented as hash table, bucket and
    node ids etc.
    Classifiers also have internal per-filter representation which is different
    from this externally visible identity. Most classifiers set this
    internal representation to be a pointer address (which allows fast retrieval
    of said filters in their implementations). This internal representation
    is referenced with the "fh" variable in the kernel control code.
    
    When a user successfuly deletes a specific filter, by specifying the correct
    tcm->tcm_handle, an event is generated to user space which indicates
    which specific filter was deleted.
    
    Before this patch, the "fh" value was sent to user space as the identity.
    As an example what is shown in the sample bpf filter delete event above
    is 0xf3be0c80. This is infact a 32-bit truncation of 0xffff8807f3be0c80
    which happens to be a 64-bit memory address of the internal filter
    representation (address of the corresponding filter's struct cls_bpf_prog);
    
    After this patch the appropriate user identifiable handle as encoded
    in the originating request tcm->tcm_handle is generated in the event.
    One of the cardinal rules of netlink rules is to be able to take an
    event (such as a delete in this case) and reflect it back to the
    kernel and successfully delete the filter. This patch achieves that.
    
    Note, this issue has existed since the original TC action
    infrastructure code patch back in 2004 as found in:
    https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/history/history.git/commit/

    net: Don't forget pr_fmt on net_dbg_ratelimited for CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG
    
    commit daddef76c3deaaa7922f9d7b18edbf0a061215c3 upstream.
    
    The implementation of net_dbg_ratelimited in the CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG
    case was added with 2c94b5373 ("net: Implement net_dbg_ratelimited() for
    CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG case"). The implementation strategy was to take the
    usual definition of the dynamic_pr_debug macro, but alter it by adding a
    call to "net_ratelimit()" in the if statement. This is, in fact, the
    correct approach.
    
    However, while doing this, the author of the commit forgot to surround
    fmt by pr_fmt, resulting in unprefixed log messages appearing in the
    console. So, this commit adds back the pr_fmt(fmt) invocation, making
    net_dbg_ratelimited properly consistent across DEBUG, no DEBUG, and
    DYNAMIC_DEBUG cases, and bringing parity with the behavior of
    dynamic_pr_debug as well.

    net: Implement net_dbg_ratelimited() for CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG case
    
    commit 2c94b53738549d81dc7464a32117d1f5112c64d3 upstream.
    
    Prior to commit d92cff89a0c8 ("net_dbg_ratelimited: turn into no-op
    when !DEBUG") the implementation of net_dbg_ratelimited() was buggy
    for both the DEBUG and CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG cases.
    
    The bug was that net_ratelimit() was being called and, despite
    returning true, nothing was being printed to the console. This
    resulted in messages like the following -
    
    "net_ratelimit: %d callbacks suppressed"
    
    with no other output nearby.
    
    After commit d92cff89a0c8 ("net_dbg_ratelimited: turn into no-op when
    !DEBUG") the bug is fixed for the DEBUG case. However, there's no
    output at all for CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG case.
    
    This patch restores debug output (if enabled) for the
    CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG case.
    
    Add a definition of net_dbg_ratelimited() for the CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG
    case. The implementation takes care to check that dynamic debugging is
    enabled before calling net_ratelimit().

    net_dbg_ratelimited: turn into no-op when !DEBUG
    
    commit d92cff89a0c80e7e49796366e441d97f07b5d321 upstream.
    
    The pr_debug family of functions turns into a no-op when -DDEBUG is not
    specified, opting instead to call "no_printk", which gets compiled to a
    no-op (but retains gcc's nice warnings about printf-style arguments).
    
    The problem with net_dbg_ratelimited is that it is defined to be a
    variant of net_ratelimited_function, which expands to essentially:
    
        if (net_ratelimit())
            pr_debug(fmt, ...);
    
    When DEBUG is not defined, then this becomes,
    
        if (net_ratelimit())
            ;
    
    This seems benign, except it isn't. Firstly, there's the obvious
    overhead of calling net_ratelimit needlessly, which does quite some book
    keeping for the rate limiting. Given that the pr_debug and
    net_dbg_ratelimited family of functions are sprinkled liberally through
    performance critical code, with developers assuming they'll be compiled
    out to a no-op most of the time, we certainly do not want this needless
    book keeping. Secondly, and most visibly, even though no debug message
    is printed when DEBUG is not defined, if there is a flood of
    invocations, dmesg winds up peppered with messages such as
    "net_ratelimit: 320 callbacks suppressed". This is because our
    aforementioned net_ratelimit() function actually prints this text in
    some circumstances. It's especially odd to see this when there isn't any
    other accompanying debug message.
    
    So, in sum, it doesn't make sense to have this function's current
    behavior, and instead it should match what every other debug family of
    functions in the kernel does with !DEBUG -- nothing.
    
    This patch replaces calls to net_dbg_ratelimited when !DEBUG with
    no_printk, keeping with the idiom of all the other debug print helpers.
    
    Also, though not strictly neccessary, it guards the call with an if (0)
    so that all evaluation of any arguments are sure to be compiled out.

    The window trap handlers are slightly clever, the trap table entries for them are
    composed of two pieces of code.  First comes the code that actually performs
    the window fill or spill trap handling, and then there are three instructions at
    the end which are for exception processing.
    
    The userland register window fill handler is:
    
            add     %sp, STACK_BIAS + 0x00, %g1;            \
            ldxa    [%g1 + %g0] ASI, %l0;                   \
            mov     0x08, %g2;                              \

            b,a,pt  %xcc, fill_fixup;
    
    And the way this works is that if any of those memory accesses
    generate an exception, the exception handler can revector to one of
    those final three branch instructions depending upon which kind of
    exception the memory access took.  In this way, the fault handler
    doesn't have to know if it was a spill or a fill that it's handling
    the fault for.  It just always branches to the last instruction in
    the parent trap's handler.
    
    For example, for a regular fault, the code goes:
    
    winfix_trampoline:
            rdpr    %tpc, %g3
            or      %g3, 0x7c, %g3
            wrpr    %g3, %tnpc
            done
    
    All window trap handlers are 0x80 aligned, so if we "or" 0x7c into the
    trap time program counter, we'll get that final instruction in the
    trap handler.
    
    On return from trap, we have to pull the register window in but we do
    this by hand instead of just executing a "restore" instruction for
    several reasons.  The largest being that from Niagara and onward we
    simply don't have enough levels in the trap stack to fully resolve all
    possible exception cases of a window fault when we are already at
    trap level 1 (which we enter to get ready to return from the original
    trap).
    
    This is executed inline via the FILL_*_RTRAP handlers.  rtrap_64.S's
    code branches directly to these to do the window fill by hand if
    necessary.  Now if you look at them, we'll see at the end:
    
                ba,a,pt    %xcc, user_rtt_fill_fixup;
                ba,a,pt    %xcc, user_rtt_fill_fixup;
                ba,a,pt    %xcc, user_rtt_fill_fixup;
    
    And oops, all three cases are handled like a fault.
    
    This doesn't work because each of these trap types (data access
    exception, memory address unaligned, and faults) store their auxiliary
    info in different registers to pass on to the C handler which does the
    real work.
    
    So in the case where the stack was unaligned, the unaligned trap
    handler sets up the arg registers one way, and then we branched to
    the fault handler which expects them setup another way.
    
    So the FAULT_TYPE_* value ends up basically being garbage, and
    randomly would generate the backtrace seen above.

    ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception
    
    Details:
    Here is the call sequence
    virtfn_add->__mlx4_init_one->dma_set_mask->dma_supported
    
    The panic happened at line 760(file arch/sparc/kernel/iommu.c)
    
    758 int dma_supported(struct device *dev, u64 device_mask)
    759 {
    760         struct iommu *iommu = dev->archdata.iommu;
    761         u64 dma_addr_mask = iommu->dma_addr_mask;
    762
    763         if (device_mask >= (1UL << 32UL))
    764                 return 0;
    765
    766         if ((device_mask & dma_addr_mask) == dma_addr_mask)
    767                 return 1;
    768
    769 #ifdef CONFIG_PCI
    770         if (dev_is_pci(dev))
    771             return pci64_dma_supported(to_pci_dev(dev), device_mask);

    773
    774         return 0;
    775 }
    776 EXPORT_SYMBOL(dma_supported);
    
    Same panic happened with Intel ixgbe driver also.
    
    SR-IOV code looks for arch specific data while enabling
    VFs. When VF device is added, driver probe function makes set
    of calls to initialize the pci device. Because the VF device is
    added different way than the normal PF device(which happens via
    of_create_pci_dev for sparc), some of the arch specific initialization
    does not happen for VF device.  That causes panic when archdata is
    accessed.
    
    To fix this, I have used already defined weak function
    pcibios_setup_device to copy archdata from PF to VF.
    Also verified the fix.

    sparc64: Fix bootup regressions on some Kconfig combinations.
    
    [ Upstream commit 49fa5230462f9f2c4e97c81356473a6bdf06c422 ]
    
    The system call tracing bug fix mentioned in the Fixes tag
    below increased the amount of assembler code in the sequence
    of assembler files included by head_64.S
    
    This caused to total set of code to exceed 0x4000 bytes in
    size, which overflows the expression in head_64.S that works
    to place swapper_tsb at address 0x408000.
    
    When this is violated, the TSB is not properly aligned, and
    also the trap table is not aligned properly either.  All of
    this together results in failed boots.
    
    So, do two things:
    
    1) Simplify some code by using ba,a instead of ba/nop to get
       those bytes back.
    
    2) Add a linker script assertion to make sure that if this
       happens again the build will fail.

    A system call trace trigger on entry allows the tracing
    process to inspect and potentially change the traced
    process's registers.
    
    Account for that by reloading the %g1 (syscall number)
    and %i0-%i5 (syscall argument) values.  We need to be
    careful to revalidate the range of %g1, and reload the
    system call table entry it corresponds to into %l7.

    On checking io.h it turned out that 'read' is not defined but 'readb' is
    defined and 'ioread8' will then obviously mean 'readb'.
    
    At the same time some of the helper functions ioreadN_rep() and

    After commit fbd40ea0180a ("ipv4: Don't do expensive useless work
    during inetdev destroy.") when deleting an interface,
    fib_del_ifaddr() can be executed without any primary address
    present on the dead interface.
    
    The above is safe, but triggers some "bug: prim == NULL" warnings.
    
    This commit avoids warning if the in_dev is dead

    net/route: enforce hoplimit max value
    
    [ Upstream commit 626abd59e51d4d8c6367e03aae252a8aa759ac78 ]
    
    Currently, when creating or updating a route, no check is performed
    in both ipv4 and ipv6 code to the hoplimit value.
    
    The caller can i.e. set hoplimit to 256, and when such route will
     be used, packets will be sent with hoplimit/ttl equal to 0.
    
    This commit adds checks for the RTAX_HOPLIMIT value, in both ipv4
    ipv6 route code, substituting any value greater than 255 with 255.
    
    This is consistent with what is currently done for ADVMSS and MTU
    in the ipv4 code.

    xfs: XFS_IS_REALTIME_INODE() should be false if no rt device present
    
    commit b31ff3cdf540110da4572e3e29bd172087af65cc upstream.
    
    If using a kernel with CONFIG_XFS_RT=y and we set the RHINHERIT flag on
    a directory in a filesystem that does not have a realtime device and
    create a new file in that directory, it gets marked as a real time file.
    When data is written and a fsync is issued, the filesystem attempts to
    flush a non-existent rt device during the fsync process.
    
    This results in a crash dereferencing a null buftarg pointer in
    xfs_blkdev_issue_flush():
    
      BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000008
      IP: xfs_blkdev_issue_flush+0xd/0x20
      .....
      Call Trace:
        xfs_file_fsync+0x188/0x1c0
        vfs_fsync_range+0x3b/0xa0

        do_syscall_64+0x4d/0xb0
        entry_SYSCALL64_slow_path+0x25/0x25
    
    Setting RT inode flags does not require special privileges so any
    unprivileged user can cause this oops to occur.  To reproduce, confirm
    kernel is compiled with CONFIG_XFS_RT=y and run:
    
      # mkfs.xfs -f /dev/pmem0
      # mount /dev/pmem0 /mnt/test
      # mkdir /mnt/test/foo
      # xfs_io -c 'chattr +t' /mnt/test/foo
      # xfs_io -f -c 'pwrite 0 5m' -c fsync /mnt/test/foo/bar
    
    Or just run xfstests with MKFS_OPTIONS="-d rtinherit=1" and wait.
    
    Kernels built with CONFIG_XFS_RT=n are not exposed to this bug.

    commit 51aa68e7d57e3217192d88ce90fd5b8ef29ec94f upstream.
    
    If L1 does not specify the "use TPR shadow" VM-execution control in
    vmcs12, then L0 must specify the "CR8-load exiting" and "CR8-store
    exiting" VM-execution controls in vmcs02. Failure to do so will give
    the L2 VM unrestricted read/write access to the hardware CR8.

    and a system crash. Add a check for the required attributes presence.
    This patch is based on the patch by bo Zhang.

    Most are caused by pointers marked as __iomem when they aren't or not marked as
    __iomem when they should.
    
    Also note that readl/writel already do endian conversion, so there is no need to
    do it again.
    
    saa7164_bus_set/get were a bit tricky: you have to make sure the msg endian
    conversion is done at the right time, and that the code isn't using fields that
    are still little endian instead of cpu-endianness.
    
    The approach chosen is to convert just before writing to the ring buffer
    and to convert it back right after reading from the ring buffer.

    btrfs: preserve i_mode if __btrfs_set_acl() fails
    
    commit d7d824966530acfe32b94d1ed672e6fe1638cd68 upstream.
    
    When changing a file's acl mask, btrfs_set_acl() will first set the
    group bits of i_mode to the value of the mask, and only then set the
    actual extended attribute representing the new acl.
    
    If the second part fails (due to lack of space, for example) and the
    file had no acl attribute to begin with, the system will from now on
    assume that the mask permission bits are actual group permission bits,
    potentially granting access to the wrong users.
    
    Prevent this by restoring the original mode bits if __btrfs_set_acl
    fails.

    ext4: Don't clear SGID when inheriting ACLs
    
    commit a3bb2d5587521eea6dab2d05326abb0afb460abd upstream.
    
    When new directory 'DIR1' is created in a directory 'DIR0' with SGID bit
    set, DIR1 is expected to have SGID bit set (and owning group equal to
    the owning group of 'DIR0'). However when 'DIR0' also has some default
    ACLs that 'DIR1' inherits, setting these ACLs will result in SGID bit on
    'DIR1' to get cleared if user is not member of the owning group.
    
    Fix the problem by moving posix_acl_update_mode() out of
    __ext4_set_acl() into ext4_set_acl(). That way the function will not be
    called when inheriting ACLs which is what we want as it prevents SGID
    bit clearing and the mode has been properly set by posix_acl_create()
    anyway.

    mm: fix overflow check in expand_upwards()
    
    commit 37511fb5c91db93d8bd6e3f52f86e5a7ff7cfcdf upstream.
    
    JÃ¶rn Engel noticed that the expand_upwards() function might not return
    -ENOMEM in case the requested address is (unsigned long)-PAGE_SIZE and
    if the architecture didn't defined TASK_SIZE as multiple of PAGE_SIZE.
    
    Affected architectures are arm, frv, m68k, blackfin, h8300 and xtensa
    which all define TASK_SIZE as 0xffffffff, but since none of those have
    an upwards-growing stack we currently have no actual issue.
    
    Nevertheless let's fix this just in case any of the architectures with
    an upward-growing stack (currently parisc, metag and partly ia64) define
    TASK_SIZE similar.

    ubifs: Don't leak kernel memory to the MTD
    
    commit 4acadda74ff8b949c448c0282765ae747e088c87 upstream.
    
    When UBIFS prepares data structures which will be written to the MTD it
    ensues that their lengths are multiple of 8. Since it uses kmalloc() the
    padded bytes are left uninitialized and we leak a few bytes of kernel
    memory to the MTD.
    To make sure that all bytes are initialized, let's switch to kzalloc().
    Kzalloc() is fine in this case because the buffers are not huge and in
    the IO path the performance bottleneck is anyway the MTD.

    ubifs: Correctly evict xattr inodes
    
    commit 272eda8298dc82eb411ece82bbb2c62911087b24 upstream.
    
    UBIFS handles extended attributes just like files, as consequence of
    that, they also have inodes.
    Therefore UBIFS does all the inode machinery also for xattrs. Since new
    inodes have i_nlink of 1, a file or xattr inode will be evicted
    if i_nlink goes down to 0 after an unlink. UBIFS assumes this model also
    for xattrs, which is not correct.
    One can create a file "foo" with xattr "user.test". By reading
    "user.test" an inode will be created, and by deleting "user.test" it
    will get evicted later. The assumption breaks if the file "foo", which
    hosts the xattrs, will be removed. VFS nor UBIFS does not remove each
    xattr via ubifs_xattr_remove(), it just removes the host inode from
    the TNC and all underlying xattr nodes too and the inode will remain
    in the cache and wastes memory.
    
    To solve this problem, remove xattr inodes from the VFS inode cache in
    ubifs_xattr_remove() to make sure that they get evicted.

    sysctl: fix lax sysctl_check_table() sanity check
    
    commit 89c5b53b16bf577079d4f0311406dbea3c71202c upstream.
    
    Patch series "sysctl: few fixes", v5.
    
    I've been working on making kmod more deterministic, and as I did that I
    couldn't help but notice a few issues with sysctl.  My end goal was just
    to fix unsigned int support, which back then was completely broken.
    Liping Zhang has sent up small atomic fixes, however it still missed yet
    one more fix and Alexey Dobriyan had also suggested to just drop array
    support given its complexity.
    
    I have inspected array support using Coccinelle and indeed its not that
    popular, so if in fact we can avoid it for new interfaces, I agree its
    best.
    
    I did develop a sysctl stress driver but will hold that off for another
    series.
    
    This patch (of 5):
    
    Commit 7c60c48f58a7 ("sysctl: Improve the sysctl sanity checks")
    improved sanity checks considerbly, however the enhancements on
    sysctl_check_table() meant adding a functional change so that only the
    last table entry's sanity error is propagated.  It also changed the way
    errors were propagated so that each new check reset the err value, this
    means only last sanity check computed is used for an error.  This has
    been in the kernel since v3.4 days.
    
    Fix this by carrying on errors from previous checks and iterations as we
    traverse the table and ensuring we keep any error from previous checks.
    We keep iterating on the table even if an error is found so we can
    complain for all errors found in one shot.  This works as -EINVAL is
    always returned on error anyway, and the check for error is any non-zero
    value.

    Input: i8042 - fix crash at boot time
    
    commit 340d394a789518018f834ff70f7534fc463d3226 upstream.
    
    The driver checks port->exists twice in i8042_interrupt(), first when
    trying to assign temporary "serio" variable, and second time when deciding
    whether it should call serio_interrupt(). The value of port->exists may
    change between the 2 checks, and we may end up calling serio_interrupt()
    with a NULL pointer:

    powerpc/64: Fix atomic64_inc_not_zero() to return an int
    
    commit 01e6a61aceb82e13bec29502a8eb70d9574f97ad upstream.
    
    Although it's not documented anywhere, there is an expectation that
    atomic64_inc_not_zero() returns a result which fits in an int. This is
    the behaviour implemented on all arches except powerpc.
    
    This has caused at least one bug in practice, in the percpu-refcount
    code, where the long result from our atomic64_inc_not_zero() was
    truncated to an int leading to lost references and stuck systems. That
    was worked around in that code in commit 966d2b04e070 ("percpu-refcount:
    fix reference leak during percpu-atomic transition").
    
    To the best of my grepping abilities there are no other callers
    in-tree which truncate the value, but we should fix it anyway. Because
    the breakage is subtle and potentially very harmful I'm also tagging
    it for stable.
    
    Code generation is largely unaffected because in most cases the
    callers are just using the result for a test anyway. In particular the
    case of fget() that was mentioned in commit a6cf7ed5119f
    ("powerpc/atomic: Implement atomic*_inc_not_zero") generates exactly
    the same code.

    crypto: caam - fix signals handling
    
    commit 7459e1d25ffefa2b1be799477fcc1f6c62f6cec7 upstream.
    
    Driver does not properly handle the case when signals interrupt
    wait_for_completion_interruptible():
    -it does not check for return value
    -completion structure is allocated on stack; in case a signal interrupts
    the sleep, it will go out of scope, causing the worker thread
    (caam_jr_dequeue) to fail when it accesses it
    
    wait_for_completion_interruptible() is replaced with uninterruptable
    wait_for_completion().
    We choose to block all signals while waiting for I/O (device executing
    the split key generation job descriptor) since the alternative - in
    order to have a deterministic device state - would be to flush the job
    ring (aborting *all* in-progress jobs).

    commit 138d351eefb727ab9e41a3dc5f112ceb4f6e59f2 upstream.
    
    This patch re-introduces part of a long standing login workaround that
    was recently dropped by:

          iscsi-target: Drop work-around for legacy GlobalSAN initiator
    
    Namely, the workaround for FirstBurstLength ended up being required by
    Mellanox Flexboot PXE boot ROMs as reported by Robert.
    
    So this patch re-adds the work-around for FirstBurstLength within
    iscsi_check_proposer_for_optional_reply(), and makes the key optional
    to respond when the initiator does not propose, nor respond to it.
    
    Also as requested by Arun, this patch introduces a new TPG attribute
    named 'login_keys_workaround' that controls the use of both the
    FirstBurstLength workaround, as well as the two other existing
    workarounds for gPXE iSCSI boot client.
    
    By default, the workaround is enabled with login_keys_workaround=1,
    since Mellanox FlexBoot requires it, and Arun has verified the Qlogic
    MSFT initiator already proposes FirstBurstLength, so it's uneffected
    by this re-adding this part of the original work-around.

    MIPS: Negate error syscall return in trace
    
    commit 4f32a39d49b25eaa66d2420f1f03d371ea4cd906 upstream.
    
    The sys_exit trace event takes a single return value for the system
    call, which MIPS passes the value of the $v0 (result) register, however
    MIPS returns positive error codes in $v0 with $a3 specifying that $v0
    contains an error code. As a result erroring system calls are traced
    returning positive error numbers that can't always be distinguished from
    success.
    
    Use regs_return_value() to negate the error code if $a3 is set.

    The workaround for the CELL timebase bug does not correctly mark cr0 as
    being clobbered. This means GCC doesn't know that the asm block changes cr0 and
    might leave the result of an unrelated comparison in cr0 across the block, which
    we then trash, leading to basically random behaviour.

    fs/dcache.c: fix spin lockup issue on nlru->lock
    
    commit b17c070fb624cf10162cf92ea5e1ec25cd8ac176 upstream.
    
    __list_lru_walk_one() acquires nlru spin lock (nlru->lock) for longer
    duration if there are more number of items in the lru list.  As per the
    current code, it can hold the spin lock for upto maximum UINT_MAX
    entries at a time.  So if there are more number of items in the lru
    list, then "BUG: spinlock lockup suspected" is observed in the below
    path:
    
      spin_bug+0x90
      do_raw_spin_lock+0xfc
      _raw_spin_lock+0x28
      list_lru_add+0x28

      user_path_at_empty+0x54
      SyS_faccessat+0xd0
      el0_svc_naked+0x24
    
    This nlru->lock is acquired by another CPU in this path -
    
      d_lru_shrink_move+0x34
      dentry_lru_isolate_shrink+0x48
      __list_lru_walk_one.isra.10+0x94
      list_lru_walk_node+0x40
      shrink_dcache_sb+0x60
      do_remount_sb+0xbc
      do_emergency_remount+0xb0
      process_one_work+0x228
      worker_thread+0x2e0
      kthread+0xf4
      ret_from_fork+0x10
    
    Fix this lockup by reducing the number of entries to be shrinked from
    the lru list to 1024 at once.  Also, add cond_resched() before
    processing the lru list again.

    mm/mmap.c: do not blow on PROT_NONE MAP_FIXED holes in the stack
    
    commit 561b5e0709e4a248c67d024d4d94b6e31e3edf2f upstream.
    
    Commit 1be7107fbe18 ("mm: larger stack guard gap, between vmas") has
    introduced a regression in some rust and Java environments which are
    trying to implement their own stack guard page.  They are punching a new
    MAP_FIXED mapping inside the existing stack Vma.
    
    This will confuse expand_{downwards,upwards} into thinking that the
    stack expansion would in fact get us too close to an existing non-stack
    vma which is a correct behavior wrt safety.  It is a real regression on
    the other hand.
    
    Let's work around the problem by considering PROT_NONE mapping as a part
    of the stack.  This is a gros hack but overflowing to such a mapping
    would trap anyway an we only can hope that usespace knows what it is
    doing and handle it propely.

    drm/radeon: Fix eDP for single-display iMac10,1 (v2)
    
    commit 564d8a2cf3abf16575af48bdc3e86e92ee8a617d upstream.
    
    The late 2009, 27 inch Apple iMac10,1 has an
    internal eDP display and an external Mini-
    Displayport output, driven by a DCE-3.2, RV730
    Radeon Mobility HD-4670.
    
    The machine worked fine in a dual-display setup
    with eDP panel + externally connected HDMI
    or DVI-D digital display sink, connected via
    MiniDP to DVI or HDMI adapter.
    
    However, booting the machine single-display with
    only eDP panel results in a completely black
    display - even backlight powering off, as soon as
    the radeon modesetting driver loads.
    
    This patch fixes the single dispay eDP case by
    assigning encoders based on dig->linkb, similar
    to DCE-4+. While this should not be generally
    necessary (Alex: "...atom on normal boards
    should be able to handle any mapping."), Apple
    seems to use some special routing here.
    
    One remaining problem not solved by this patch
    is that an external Minidisplayport->DP sink
    does still not work on iMac10,1, whereas external
    DVI and HDMI sinks continue to work.
    
    The problem affects at least all tested kernels
    since Linux 3.13 - didn't test earlier kernels, so
    backporting to stable probably makes sense.
    
    v2: With the original patch from 2016, Alex was worried it
        will break other DCE3.2 systems. Use dmi_match() to
        apply this special encoder assignment only for the
        Apple iMac 10,1 from late 2009.

    cfg80211: Validate frequencies nested in NL80211_ATTR_SCAN_FREQUENCIES
    
    commit d7f13f7450369281a5d0ea463cc69890a15923ae upstream.
    
    validate_scan_freqs() retrieves frequencies from attributes
    nested in the attribute NL80211_ATTR_SCAN_FREQUENCIES with
    nla_get_u32(), which reads 4 bytes from each attribute
    without validating the size of data received. Attributes
    nested in NL80211_ATTR_SCAN_FREQUENCIES don't have an nla policy.
    
    Validate size of each attribute before parsing to avoid potential buffer
    overread.

    commit 8feb69c7bd89513be80eb19198d48f154b254021 upstream.
    
    Buffer overread may happen as nl80211_set_station() reads 4 bytes
    from the attribute NL80211_ATTR_LOCAL_MESH_POWER_MODE without
    validating the size of data received when userspace sends less
    than 4 bytes of data with NL80211_ATTR_LOCAL_MESH_POWER_MODE.

    the buffer overread.

    cfg80211: Check if PMKID attribute is of expected size
    
    commit 9361df14d1cbf966409d5d6f48bb334384fbe138 upstream.
    
    nla policy checks for only maximum length of the attribute data
    when the attribute type is NLA_BINARY. If userspace sends less
    data than specified, the wireless drivers may access illegal
    memory. When type is NLA_UNSPEC, nla policy check ensures that
    userspace sends minimum specified length number of bytes.
    
    Remove type assignment to NLA_BINARY from nla_policy of
    NL80211_ATTR_PMKID to make this NLA_UNSPEC and to make sure minimum
    WLAN_PMKID_LEN bytes are received from userspace with
    NL80211_ATTR_PMKID.

    target: Fix COMPARE_AND_WRITE caw_sem leak during se_cmd quiesce
    
    commit 1d6ef276594a781686058802996e09c8550fd767 upstream.
    
    This patch addresses a COMPARE_AND_WRITE se_device->caw_sem leak,
    that would be triggered during normal se_cmd shutdown or abort
    via __transport_wait_for_tasks().
    
    This would occur because target_complete_cmd() would catch this
    early and do complete_all(&cmd->t_transport_stop_comp), but since
    target_complete_ok_work() or target_complete_failure_work() are
    never called to invoke se_cmd->transport_complete_callback(),
    the COMPARE_AND_WRITE specific callbacks never release caw_sem.
    
    To address this special case, go ahead and release caw_sem
    directly from target_complete_cmd().
    
    (Remove '&& success' from check, to release caw_sem regardless
     of scsi_status - nab)

    CIFS: fix circular locking dependency
    
    commit 966681c9f029afd5decee069b7658bb58ad0a863 upstream.
    
    When a CIFS filesystem is mounted with the forcemand option and the
    following command is run on it, lockdep warns about a circular locking
    dependency between CifsInodeInfo::lock_sem and the inode lock.
    
     while echo foo > hello; do :; done & while touch -c hello; do :; done
    
    cifs_writev() takes the locks in the wrong order, but note that we can't
    only flip the order around because it releases the inode lock before the
    call to generic_write_sync() while it holds the lock_sem across that
    call.
    
    But, AFAICS, there is no need to hold the CifsInodeInfo::lock_sem across
    the generic_write_sync() call either, so we can release both the locks
    before generic_write_sync(), and change the order.

    RDMA/uverbs: Check port number supplied by user verbs cmds
    
    commit 5ecce4c9b17bed4dc9cb58bfb10447307569b77b upstream.
    
    The ib_uverbs_create_ah() ind ib_uverbs_modify_qp() calls receive
    the port number from user input as part of its attributes and assumes
    it is valid. Down on the stack, that parameter is used to access kernel
    data structures.  If the value is invalid, the kernel accesses memory
    it should not.  To prevent this, verify the port number before using it.

    drm/i915: Disable MSI for all pre-gen5
    
    commit ce3f7163e4ce8fd583dcb36b6ee6b81fd1b419ae upstream.
    
    We have pretty clear evidence that MSIs are getting lost on g4x and
    somehow the interrupt logic doesn't seem to recover from that state
    even if we try hard to clear the IIR.
    
    Disabling IER around the normal IIR clearing in the irq handler isn't
    sufficient to avoid this, so the problem really seems to be further
    up the interrupt chain. This should guarantee that there's always
    an edge if any IIR bits are set after the interrupt handler is done,
    which should normally guarantee that the CPU interrupt is generated.
    That approach seems to work perfectly on VLV/CHV, but apparently
    not on g4x.
    
    MSI is documented to be broken on 965gm at least. The chipset spec
    says MSI is defeatured because interrupts can be delayed or lost,
    which fits well with what we're seeing on g4x. Previously we've
    already disabled GMBUS interrupts on g4x because somehow GMBUS
    manages to raise legacy interrupts even when MSI is enabled.
    
    Since there's such widespread MSI breakahge all over in the pre-gen5
    land let's just give up on MSI on these platforms.
    
    Seqno reporting might be negatively affected by this since the legcy
    interrupts aren't guaranteed to be ordered with the seqno writes,
    whereas MSI interrupts may be? But an occasioanlly missed seqno
    seems like a small price to pay for generally working interrupts.

    So, lets allow it.

    ipv6: dad: don't remove dynamic addresses if link is down
    
    commit ec8add2a4c9df723c94a863b8fcd6d93c472deed upstream.
    
    Currently, when the link for $DEV is down, this command succeeds but the
    address is removed immediately by DAD (1):
    
        ip addr add 1111::12/64 dev $DEV valid_lft 3600 preferred_lft 1800
    
    In the same situation, this will succeed and not remove the address (2):
    
        ip addr add 1111::12/64 dev $DEV
        ip addr change 1111::12/64 dev $DEV valid_lft 3600 preferred_lft 1800
    
    The comment in addrconf_dad_begin() when !IF_READY makes it look like
    this is the intended behavior, but doesn't explain why:
    
         * If the device is not ready:
         * - keep it tentative if it is a permanent address.
         * - otherwise, kill it.
    
    We clearly cannot prevent userspace from doing (2), but we can make (1)
    work consistently with (2).
    
    addrconf_dad_stop() is only called in two cases: if DAD failed, or to
    skip DAD when the link is down. In that second case, the fix is to avoid
    deleting the address, like we already do for permanent addresses.

    The userspace needs to know why is the address being removed so that it can
    perhaps obtain a new address.
    
    Without the DADFAILED flag it's impossible to distinguish removal of a

    parisc: Report SIGSEGV instead of SIGBUS when running out of stack
    
    commit 247462316f85a9e0479445c1a4223950b68ffac1 upstream.
    
    When a process runs out of stack the parisc kernel wrongly faults with SIGBUS
    instead of the expected SIGSEGV signal.
    
    This example shows how the kernel faults:
    do_page_fault() command='a.out' type=15 address=0xfaac2000 in libc-2.24.so[f8308000+16c000]
    trap #15: Data TLB miss fault, vm_start = 0xfa2c2000, vm_end = 0xfaac2000
    
    The vma->vm_end value is the first address which does not belong to the vma, so
    adjust the check to include vma->vm_end to the range for which to send the
    SIGSEGV signal.
    
    This patch unbreaks building the debian libsigsegv package.

    scsi: Add STARGET_CREATED_REMOVE state to scsi_target_state
    
    commit f9279c968c257ee39b0d7bd2571a4d231a67bcc1 upstream.
    
    The addition of the STARGET_REMOVE state had the side effect of
    introducing a race condition that can cause a crash.
    
    scsi_target_reap_ref_release() checks the starget->state to
    see if it still in STARGET_CREATED, and if so, skips calling
    transport_remove_device() and device_del(), because the starget->state
    is only set to STARGET_RUNNING after scsi_target_add() has called
    device_add() and transport_add_device().
    
    However, if an rport loss occurs while a target is being scanned,
    it can happen that scsi_remove_target() will be called while the
    starget is still in the STARGET_CREATED state.  In this case, the
    starget->state will be set to STARGET_REMOVE, and as a result,
    scsi_target_reap_ref_release() will take the wrong path.  The end
    result is a panic:

    PCI/PM: Restore the status of PCI devices across hibernation
    
    commit e60514bd4485c0c7c5a7cf779b200ce0b95c70d6 upstream.
    
    Currently we saw a lot of "No irq handler" errors during hibernation, which
    caused the system hang finally:
    
      ata4.00: qc timeout (cmd 0xec)
      ata4.00: failed to IDENTIFY (I/O error, err_mask=0x4)
      ata4.00: revalidation failed (errno=-5)
      ata4: SATA link up 6.0 Gbps (SStatus 133 SControl 300)
      do_IRQ: 31.151 No irq handler for vector
    
    According to above logs, there is an interrupt triggered and it is
    dispatched to CPU31 with a vector number 151, but there is no handler for
    it, thus this IRQ will not get acked and will cause an IRQ flood which
    kills the system.  To be more specific, the 31.151 is an interrupt from the
    AHCI host controller.
    
    After some investigation, the reason why this issue is triggered is because
    the thaw_noirq() function does not restore the MSI/MSI-X settings across
    hibernation.
    
    The scenario is illustrated below:
    
      1. Before hibernation, IRQ 34 is the handler for the AHCI device, which
         is bound to CPU31.
    
      2. Hibernation starts, the AHCI device is put into low power state.
    
      3. All the nonboot CPUs are put offline, so IRQ 34 has to be migrated to
         the last alive one - CPU0.
    
      4. After the snapshot has been created, all the nonboot CPUs are brought
         up again; IRQ 34 remains bound to CPU0.
    
      5. AHCI devices are put into D0.
    
      6. The snapshot is written to the disk.
    
    The issue is triggered in step 6.  The AHCI interrupt should be delivered
    to CPU0, however it is delivered to the original CPU31 instead, which
    causes the "No irq handler" issue.
    
    Ying Huang has provided a clue that, in step 3 it is possible that writing
    to the register might not take effect as the PCI devices have been
    suspended.
    
    In step 3, the IRQ 34 affinity should be modified from CPU31 to CPU0, but
    in fact it is not.  In __pci_write_msi_msg(), if the device is already in
    low power state, the low level MSI message entry will not be updated but
    cached.  During the device restore process after a normal suspend/resume,
    pci_restore_msi_state() writes the cached MSI back to the hardware.
    
    But this is not the case for hibernation.  pci_restore_msi_state() is not
    currently called in pci_pm_thaw_noirq(), although pci_save_state() has
    saved the necessary PCI cached information in pci_pm_freeze_noirq().
    
    Restore the PCI status for the device during hibernation.  Otherwise the
    status might be lost across hibernation (for example, settings for MSI,
    MSI-X, ATS, ACS, IOV, etc.), which might cause problems during hibernation.

    btrfs: Don't clear SGID when inheriting ACLs
    
    commit b7f8a09f8097db776b8d160862540e4fc1f51296 upstream.
    
    When new directory 'DIR1' is created in a directory 'DIR0' with SGID bit
    set, DIR1 is expected to have SGID bit set (and owning group equal to
    the owning group of 'DIR0'). However when 'DIR0' also has some default
    ACLs that 'DIR1' inherits, setting these ACLs will result in SGID bit on
    'DIR1' to get cleared if user is not member of the owning group.
    
    Fix the problem by moving posix_acl_update_mode() out of
    __btrfs_set_acl() into btrfs_set_acl(). That way the function will not be
    called when inheriting ACLs which is what we want as it prevents SGID
    bit clearing and the mode has been properly set by posix_acl_create()
    anyway.

    arm64: ptrace: Avoid setting compat FP[SC]R to garbage if get_user fails
    
    commit 53b1a742ed251780267a57415bc955bd50f40c3d upstream.
    
    If get_user() fails when reading the new FPSCR value from userspace
    in compat_vfp_get(), then garbage* will be written to the task's
    FPSR and FPCR registers.
    
    This patch prevents this by checking the return from get_user()
    first.
    
    [*] Actually, zero, due to the behaviour of get_user() on error, but
    that's still not what userspace expects.

    Add USB quirk for HVR-950q to avoid intermittent device resets
    
    commit 6836796de4019944f4ba4c99a360e8250fd2e735 upstream.
    
    The USB core and sysfs will attempt to enumerate certain parameters
    which are unsupported by the au0828 - causing inconsistent behavior
    and sometimes causing the chip to reset.  Avoid making these calls.
    
    This problem manifested as intermittent cases where the au8522 would
    be reset on analog video startup, in particular when starting up ALSA
    audio streaming in parallel - the sysfs entries created by
    snd-usb-audio on streaming startup would result in unsupported control
    messages being sent during tuning which would put the chip into an
    unknown state.

    MIPS: Send SIGILL for BPOSGE32 in `__compute_return_epc_for_insn'
    
    commit 7b82c1058ac1f8f8b9f2b8786b1f710a57a870a8 upstream.
    
    Fix commit e50c0a8fa60d ("Support the MIPS32 / MIPS64 DSP ASE.") and
    send SIGILL rather than SIGBUS whenever an unimplemented BPOSGE32 DSP
    ASE instruction has been encountered in `__compute_return_epc_for_insn'
    as our Reserved Instruction exception handler would in response to an
    attempt to actually execute the instruction.  Sending SIGBUS only makes
    sense for the unaligned PC case, since moved to `__compute_return_epc'.
    Adjust function documentation accordingly, correct formatting and use
    `pr_info' rather than `printk' as the other exit path already does.

    MIPS: Fix unaligned PC interpretation in `compute_return_epc'
    
    commit 11a3799dbeb620bf0400b1fda5cc2c6bea55f20a upstream.
    
    Fix a regression introduced with commit fb6883e5809c ("MIPS: microMIPS:
    Support handling of delay slots.") and defer to `__compute_return_epc'
    if the ISA bit is set in EPC with non-MIPS16, non-microMIPS hardware,
    which will then arrange for a SIGBUS due to an unaligned instruction
    reference.  Returning EPC here is never correct as the API defines this
    function's result to be either a negative error code on failure or one
    of 0 and BRANCH_LIKELY_TAKEN on success.

    and emulation triggers for the CTC1 instruction.  As it is in a jump
    delay slot emulation continues from `401312' (`401313' with the ISA
    bit).  However we have no path to handle MIPS16 FPU code emulation,
    because there are no MIPS16 FPU instructions.  So the default emulation
    path is taken, interpreting a 32-bit word fetched by `get_user' from
    `401313' as a regular MIPS instruction, which is:
    
      401313:       f5ea0a92        sdc1    $f10,2706(t7)
    
    This makes the FPU emulator proceed with the supposed SDC1 instruction
    and consequently makes the program considered here terminate with
    SIGSEGV.
    
    A similar although less severe issue exists with pure-microMIPS
    processors in the case where similarly an FPU instruction is emulated in
    a delay slot of a register jump that (incorrectly) switches into the
    regular MIPS mode.  A subsequent instruction fetch from the jump's
    target is supposed to cause an Address Error exception, however instead
    we proceed with regular MIPS FPU emulation.
    
    For simplicity then, always terminate the emulation loop whenever a mode
    change is detected, denoted by an ISA mode bit flip.  As from commit
    377cb1b6c16a ("MIPS: Disable MIPS16/microMIPS crap for platforms not
    supporting these ASEs.") the result of `get_isa16_mode' can be hardcoded
    to 0, so we need to examine the ISA mode bit by hand.
    
    This complements commit 102cedc32a6e ("MIPS: microMIPS: Floating point
    support.") which added JALX decoding to FPU emulation.

    PCI: Work around poweroff & suspend-to-RAM issue on Macbook Pro 11
    
    commit 13cfc732160f7bc7e596128ce34cda361c556966 upstream.
    
    Neither soft poweroff (transition to ACPI power state S5) nor
    suspend-to-RAM (transition to state S3) works on the Macbook Pro 11,4 and
    11,5.
    
    The problem is related to the [mem 0x7fa00000-0x7fbfffff] space.  When we
    use that space, e.g., by assigning it to the 00:1c.0 Root Port, the ACPI
    Power Management 1 Control Register (PM1_CNT) at [io 0x1804] doesn't work
    anymore.
    
    Linux does a soft poweroff (transition to S5) by writing to PM1_CNT.  The
    theory about why this doesn't work is:
    
      - The write to PM1_CNT causes an SMI
      - The BIOS SMI handler depends on something in
        [mem 0x7fa00000-0x7fbfffff]
      - When Linux assigns [mem 0x7fa00000-0x7fbfffff] to the 00:1c.0 Port, it
        covers up whatever the SMI handler uses, so the SMI handler no longer
        works correctly
    
    Reserve the [mem 0x7fa00000-0x7fbfffff] space so we don't assign it to
    anything.
    
    This is voodoo programming, since we don't know what the real conflict is,
    but we've failed to find the root cause.

    PCI: Mark Haswell Power Control Unit as having non-compliant BARs
    
    commit 6af7e4f77259ee946103387372cb159f2e99a6d4 upstream.
    
    The Haswell Power Control Unit has a non-PCI register (CONFIG_TDP_NOMINAL)
    where BAR 0 is supposed to be.  This is erratum HSE43 in the spec update
    referenced below:
    
      The PCIe* Base Specification indicates that Configuration Space Headers
      have a base address register at offset 0x10.  Due to this erratum, the
      Power Control Unit's CONFIG_TDP_NOMINAL CSR (Bus 1; Device 30; Function
      3; Offset 0x10) is located where a base register is expected.
    
    Mark the PCU as having non-compliant BARs so we don't try to probe any of
    them.  There are no other BARs on this device.
    
    Rename the quirk so it's not Broadwell-specific.

    vfio: New external user group/file match
    
    commit 5d6dee80a1e94cc284d03e06d930e60e8d3ecf7d upstream.
    
    At the point where the kvm-vfio pseudo device wants to release its
    vfio group reference, we can't always acquire a new reference to make
    that happen.  The group can be in a state where we wouldn't allow a
    new reference to be added.  This new helper function allows a caller
    to match a file to a group to facilitate this.  Given a file and
    group, report if they match.  Thus the caller needs to already have a
    group reference to match to the file.  This allows the deletion of a
    group without acquiring a new reference.

    ath9k: fix tx99 use after free
    
    commit cf8ce1ea61b75712a154c93e40f2a5af2e4dd997 upstream.
    
    One scenario that could lead to UAF is two threads writing
    simultaneously to the "tx99" debug file. One of them would
    set the "start" value to true and follow to ath9k_tx99_init().
    Inside the function it would set the sc->tx99_state to true
    after allocating sc->tx99skb. Then, the other thread would
    execute write_file_tx99() and call ath9k_tx99_deinit().
    sc->tx99_state would be freed. After that, the first thread
    would continue inside ath9k_tx99_init() and call
    r = ath9k_tx99_send(sc, sc->tx99_skb, &txctl);
    that would make use of the freed sc->tx99_skb memory.

    MIPS: Save static registers before sysmips
    
    commit 49955d84cd9ccdca5a16a495e448e1a06fad9e49 upstream.
    
    The MIPS sysmips system call handler may return directly from the
    MIPS_ATOMIC_SET case (mips_atomic_set()) to syscall_exit. This path
    restores the static (callee saved) registers, however they won't have
    been saved on entry to the system call.
    
    Use the save_static_function() macro to create a __sys_sysmips wrapper
    function which saves the static registers before calling sys_sysmips, so
    that the correct static register state is restored by syscall_exit.

    commit 2ec420b26f7b6ff332393f0bb5a7d245f7ad87f0 upstream.
    
    The inline asm retry check in the MIPS_ATOMIC_SET operation of the

    Rewrite sysmips(MIPS_ATOMIC_SET, ...) in C with inline assembler")
    merged in v2.6.32, resulting in the non R10000_LLSC_WAR case retrying
    until the operation was inatomic, before returning the new value that
    was probably just written multiple times instead of the old value.
    
    Invert the branch condition to fix that particular issue.

    MIPS: Bail on unsupported module relocs
    
    commit 04211a574641e29b529dcc84e75c03d7e9e368cf upstream.
    
    When an unsupported reloc is encountered in a module, we currently
    blindly branch to whatever would be at its entry in the reloc handler
    function pointer arrays. This may be NULL, or if the unsupported reloc
    has a type greater than that of the supported reloc with the highest
    type then we'll dereference some value after the function pointer array
    & branch to that. The result is at best a kernel oops.
    
    Fix this by checking that the reloc type has an entry in the function
    pointer array (ie. is less than the number of items in the array) and
    that the handler is non-NULL, returning an error code to fail the module
    load if no handler is found.

    xfs: Don't clear SGID when inheriting ACLs
    
    commit 8ba358756aa08414fa9e65a1a41d28304ed6fd7f upstream.
    
    When new directory 'DIR1' is created in a directory 'DIR0' with SGID bit
    set, DIR1 is expected to have SGID bit set (and owning group equal to
    the owning group of 'DIR0'). However when 'DIR0' also has some default
    ACLs that 'DIR1' inherits, setting these ACLs will result in SGID bit on
    'DIR1' to get cleared if user is not member of the owning group.
    
    Fix the problem by calling __xfs_set_acl() instead of xfs_set_acl() when
    setting up inode in xfs_generic_create(). That prevents SGID bit
    clearing and mode is properly set by posix_acl_create() anyway. We also
    reorder arguments of __xfs_set_acl() to match the ordering of
    xfs_set_acl() to make things consistent.

    scsi: virtio_scsi: let host do exception handling
    
    commit e72c9a2a67a6400c8ef3d01d4c461dbbbfa0e1f0 upstream.
    
    virtio_scsi tries to do exception handling after the default 30 seconds
    timeout expires.  However, it's better to let the host control the
    timeout, otherwise with a heavy I/O load it is likely that an abort will
    also timeout.  This leads to fatal errors like filesystems going
    offline.
    
    Disable the 'sd' timeout and allow the host to do exception handling,
    following the precedent of the storvsc driver.
    
    Hannes has a proposal to introduce timeouts in virtio, but this provides
    an immediate solution for stable kernels too.

    af_iucv: Move sockaddr length checks to before accessing sa_family in bind and connect handlers
    
    commit e3c42b61ff813921ba58cfc0019e3fd63f651190 upstream.
    
    Verify that the caller-provided sockaddr structure is large enough to
    contain the sa_family field, before accessing it in bind() and connect()
    handlers of the AF_IUCV socket. Since neither syscall enforces a minimum
    size of the corresponding memory region, very short sockaddrs (zero or
    one byte long) result in operating on uninitialized memory while
    referencing .sa_family.

    i2c: cadance: fix ctrl/addr reg write order
    
    commit 8064c616984eaa015f018dba595d78cd24a0cc8c upstream.
    
    The driver was clearing the hold bit in the control register before
    writing to the address register which resulted in a stop condition
    being generated rather than a repeated start.
    
    This issue was only observed when a system was running much
    slower than a normal processor would execute.  The IP data sheet
    mentions a ordering of writing to the address register before
    clearing the hold.

    staging: comedi: fix clean-up of comedi_class in comedi_init()
    
    commit a9332e9ad09c2644c99058fcf6ae2f355e93ce74 upstream.
    
    There is a clean-up bug in the core comedi module initialization
    functions, `comedi_init()`.  If the `comedi_num_legacy_minors` module
    parameter is non-zero (and valid), it creates that many "legacy" devices
    and registers them in SysFS.  A failure causes the function to clean up
    and return an error.  Unfortunately, it fails to destroy the "comedi"
    class that was created earlier.  Fix it by adding a call to
    `class_destroy(comedi_class)` at the appropriate place in the clean-up
    sequence.

    spi: atmel: fix corrupted data issue on SAM9 family SoCs
    
    commit 7094576ccdc3acfe1e06a1e2ab547add375baf7f upstream.
    
    This patch disables the use of the DMA for data transfer and forces the
    use of PIO transfers instead as a quick fixup to solve the cache aliasing
    issue on ARM9 based cores, which embeds a VIVT data cache.
    
    Indeed in the case of VIVT data caches, it is not safe to call dma_map_*()
    functions to map buffers for DMA transfers when those buffers have been
    allocated by vmalloc() or from any DMA-unsafe area.
    
    Further patches may propose a better solution based on the use of a bounce
    buffer at the SPI sub-system level but such solution needs more time to be
    discussed. Then the use of DMA transfers could be enabled again to improve
    the performances but before that, this patch already solves the issue.

    iwlwifi: mvm: fix the recovery flow while connecting
    
    commit 6b28f9784c394f0692e160f81b07c82cb64af160 upstream.
    
    In BSS mode in the disconnection flow, mac80211 removes
    the AP station before the vif is set to unassociated.
    Our firmware wants it the other way around: first set
    the vif as unassociated, and then remove the AP station.
    
    In order to bridge between those two different behaviors,
    iwlmvm doesn't remove the station from the firmware when
    mac80211 removes it, but only after the vif is set to
    unassociated. The implementation is in
    iwl_mvm_bss_info_changed_station:
    
    if (assoc state was modified && mvmvif->ap_sta_id is VALID
        && assoc state is now UNASSC)
            remove_the_station_from_the_firmware()
    
    During the recovery flow, mac80211 re-adds the AP station
    and then reconfigures the vif. Since the vif is not
    associated, and then, we enter the if above (which was
    intended to be taken in the disconnection flow only) and
    remove the station we just added. This defeats the
    recovery flow.
    
    Fix this by not removing the AP station in this flow if
    we are in recovery flow.

    Btrfs: fix invalid extent maps due to hole punching
    
    commit 609805d809733d0c669f21f710bdac308cc63cba upstream.
    
    While punching a hole in a range that is not aligned with the sector size
    (currently the same as the page size) we can end up leaving an extent map
    in memory with a length that is smaller then the sector size or with a
    start offset that is not aligned to the sector size. Both cases are not
    expected and can lead to problems. This issue is easily detected
    after the patch from commit a7e3b975a0f9 ("Btrfs: fix reported number of
    inode blocks"), introduced in kernel 4.12-rc1, in a scenario like the
    following for example:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
      $ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
      $ xfs_io -c "pwrite -S 0xaa -b 100K 0 100K" /mnt/foo
      $ xfs_io -c "fpunch 60K 90K" /mnt/foo
      $ xfs_io -c "pwrite -S 0xbb -b 100K 50K 100K" /mnt/foo
      $ xfs_io -c "pwrite -S 0xcc -b 50K 100K 50K" /mnt/foo
      $ umount /mnt
    
    After the unmount operation we can see several warnings emmitted due to
    underflows related to space reservation counters:

    What happens in the above example is the following:
    
    1) When punching the hole, at btrfs_punch_hole(), the variable tail_len
       is set to 2048 (as tail_start is 148Kb + 1 and offset + len is 150Kb).
       This results in the creation of an extent map with a length of 2Kb
       starting at file offset 148Kb, through find_first_non_hole() ->
       btrfs_get_extent().
    
    2) The second write (first write after the hole punch operation), sets
       the range [50Kb, 152Kb[ to delalloc.
    
    3) The third write, at btrfs_find_new_delalloc_bytes(), sees the extent
       map covering the range [148Kb, 150Kb[ and ends up calling
       set_extent_bit() for the same range, which results in splitting an
       existing extent state record, covering the range [148Kb, 152Kb[ into
       two 2Kb extent state records, covering the ranges [148Kb, 150Kb[ and
       [150Kb, 152Kb[.
    
    4) Finally at lock_and_cleanup_extent_if_need(), immediately after calling
       btrfs_find_new_delalloc_bytes() we clear the delalloc bit from the
       range [100Kb, 152Kb[ which results in the btrfs_clear_bit_hook()
       callback being invoked against the two 2Kb extent state records that
       cover the ranges [148Kb, 150Kb[ and [150Kb, 152Kb[. When called against
       the first 2Kb extent state, it calls btrfs_delalloc_release_metadata()
       with a length argument of 2048 bytes. That function rounds up the length
       to a sector size aligned length, so it ends up considering a length of
       4096 bytes, and then calls calc_csum_metadata_size() which results in
       decrementing the inode's csum_bytes counter by 4096 bytes, so after
       it stays a value of 0 bytes. Then the same happens when
       btrfs_clear_bit_hook() is called against the second extent state that
       has a length of 2Kb, covering the range [150Kb, 152Kb[, the length is
       rounded up to 4096 and calc_csum_metadata_size() ends up being called
       to decrement 4096 bytes from the inode's csum_bytes counter, which
       at that time has a value of 0, leading to an underflow, which is
       exactly what triggers the first warning, at btrfs_destroy_inode().
       All the other warnings relate to several space accounting counters
       that underflow as well due to similar reasons.
    
    A similar case but where the hole punching operation creates an extent map
    with a start offset not aligned to the sector size is the following:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
      $ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
      $ xfs_io -f -c "fpunch 695K 820K" $SCRATCH_MNT/bar
      $ xfs_io -c "pwrite -S 0xaa 1008K 307K" $SCRATCH_MNT/bar
      $ xfs_io -c "pwrite -S 0xbb -b 630K 1073K 630K" $SCRATCH_MNT/bar
      $ xfs_io -c "pwrite -S 0xcc -b 459K 1068K 459K" $SCRATCH_MNT/bar
      $ umount /mnt
    
    During the unmount operation we get similar traces for the same reasons as
    in the first example.
    
    So fix the hole punching operation to make sure it never creates extent
    maps with a length that is not aligned to the sector size nor with a start
    offset that is not aligned to the sector size, as this breaks all
    assumptions and it's a land mine.

    commit dec08194ffeccfa1cf085906b53d301930eae18f upstream.
    
    For AMD Promontory xHCI host, although you can disable USB 2.0 ports in
    BIOS settings, those ports will be enabled anyway after you remove a
    device on that port and re-plug it in again. It's a known limitation of
    the chip. As a workaround we can clear the PORT_WAKE_BITS.
    
    This will disable wake on connect, disconnect and overcurrent on
    AMD Promontory USB2 ports

    Btrfs: skip commit transaction if we don't have enough pinned bytes
    
    commit 28785f70ef882e4798cd5706066a55dbf7adf80e upstream.
    
    We commit transaction in order to reclaim space from pinned bytes because
    it could process delayed refs, and in may_commit_transaction(), we check
    first if pinned bytes are enough for the required space, we then check if
    that plus bytes reserved for delayed insert are enough for the required
    space.
    
    This changes the code to the above logic.

    NFC: fix broken device allocation
    
    commit 20777bc57c346b6994f465e0d8261a7fbf213a09 upstream.
    
    Commit 7eda8b8e9677 ("NFC: Use IDR library to assing NFC devices IDs")
    moved device-id allocation and struct-device initialisation from
    nfc_allocate_device() to nfc_register_device().
    
    This broke just about every nfc-device-registration error path, which
    continue to call nfc_free_device() that tries to put the device
    reference of the now uninitialised (but zeroed) struct device:
    
    kobject: '(null)' (ce316420): is not initialized, yet kobject_put() is being called.
    
    The late struct-device initialisation also meant that various work
    queues whose names are derived from the nfc device name were also
    misnamed:
    
      421 root         0 SW<  [(null)_nci_cmd_]
      422 root         0 SW<  [(null)_nci_rx_w]
      423 root         0 SW<  [(null)_nci_tx_w]
    
    Move the id-allocation and struct-device initialisation back to
    nfc_allocate_device() and fix up the single call site which did not use
    nfc_free_device() in its error path.

    udf: Fix deadlock between writeback and udf_setsize()
    
    commit f2e95355891153f66d4156bf3a142c6489cd78c6 upstream.
    
    udf_setsize() called truncate_setsize() with i_data_sem held. Thus
    truncate_pagecache() called from truncate_setsize() could lock a page
    under i_data_sem which can deadlock as page lock ranks below
    i_data_sem - e. g. writeback can hold page lock and try to acquire
    i_data_sem to map a block.
    
    Fix the problem by moving truncate_setsize() calls from under
    i_data_sem. It is safe for us to change i_size without holding
    i_data_sem as all the places that depend on i_size being stable already
    hold inode_lock.

    commit 9795e0e8ac0d6a3ee092f1b555b284b57feef99e upstream.
    
    __udf_adinicb_readpage() uses i_size several times. When truncate
    changes i_size while the function is running, it can observe several
    different values and thus e.g. expose uninitialized parts of page to
    userspace. Also use i_size_read() in the function since it does not hold
    inode_lock. Since i_size is guaranteed to be small, this cannot really
    cause any issues even on 32-bit archs but let's be careful.

    md: don't use flush_signals in userspace processes
    
    commit f9c79bc05a2a91f4fba8bfd653579e066714b1ec upstream.
    
    The function flush_signals clears all pending signals for the process. It
    may be used by kernel threads when we need to prepare a kernel thread for
    responding to signals. However using this function for an userspaces
    processes is incorrect - clearing signals without the program expecting it
    can cause misbehavior.
    
    The raid1 and raid5 code uses flush_signals in its request routine because
    it wants to prepare for an interruptible wait. This patch drops
    flush_signals and uses sigprocmask instead to block all signals (including
    SIGKILL) around the schedule() call. The signals are not lost, but the
    schedule() call won't respond to them.

    commit 2f686f1d9beee135de6d08caea707ec7bfc916d4 upstream.
    
    PCI_STD_RESOURCE_END is (confusingly) the index of the last valid BAR, not
    the *number* of BARs.  To iterate through all possible BARs, we need to
    include PCI_STD_RESOURCE_END.

    usb: usbip: set buffer pointers to NULL after free
    
    commit b3b51417d0af63fb9a06662dc292200aed9ea53f upstream.
    
    The usbip stack dynamically allocates the transfer_buffer and
    setup_packet of each urb that got generated by the tcp to usb stub code.
    As these pointers are always used only once we will set them to NULL
    after use. This is done likewise to the free_urb code in vudc_dev.c.
    This patch fixes double kfree situations where the usbip remote side
    added the URB_FREE_BUFFER.

    perf/core: Correct event creation with PERF_FORMAT_GROUP
    
    commit ba5213ae6b88fb170c4771fef6553f759c7d8cdd upstream.
    
    Andi was asking about PERF_FORMAT_GROUP vs inherited events, which led
    to the discovery of a bug from commit:
    
      3dab77fb1bf8 ("perf: Rework/fix the whole read vs group stuff")
    
     -       PERF_SAMPLE_GROUP                       = 1U << 4,
     +       PERF_SAMPLE_READ                        = 1U << 4,
    
     -       if (attr->inherit && (attr->sample_type & PERF_SAMPLE_GROUP))
     +       if (attr->inherit && (attr->read_format & PERF_FORMAT_GROUP))
    
    is a clear fail :/
    
    While this changes user visible behaviour; it was previously possible
    to create an inherited event with PERF_SAMPLE_READ; this is deemed
    acceptible because its results were always incorrect.

    commit a8b6fda38f80e75afa3b125c9e7f2550b579454b upstream.
    
    The MSR permission bitmaps are shared by all VMs. However, some VMs
    may not be configured to support MPX, even when the host does. If the
    host supports VMX and the guest does not, we should intercept accesses
    to the BNDCFGS MSR, so that we can synthesize a #GP
    fault. Furthermore, if the host does not support MPX and the
    "ignore_msrs" kvm kernel parameter is set, then we should intercept
    accesses to the BNDCFGS MSR, so that we can skip over the rdmsr/wrmsr
    without raising a #GP fault.

    drm/i915: Workaround VLV/CHV DSI scanline counter hardware fail
    
    commit ec1b4ee2834e66884e5b0d3d465f347ff212e372 upstream.
    
    The scanline counter is bonkers on VLV/CHV DSI. The scanline counter
    increment is not lined up with the start of vblank like it is on
    every other platform and output type. This causes problems for
    both the vblank timestamping and atomic update vblank evasion.
    
    On my FFRD8 machine at least, the scanline counter increment
    happens about 1/3 of a scanline ahead of the start of vblank (which
    is where all register latching happens still). That means we can't
    trust the scanline counter to tell us whether we're in vblank or not
    while we're on that particular line. In order to keep vblank
    timestamping in working condition when called from the vblank irq,
    we'll leave scanline_offset at one, which means that the entire
    line containing the start of vblank is considered to be inside
    the vblank.
    
    For the vblank evasion we'll need to consider that entire line
    to be bad, since we can't tell whether the registers already
    got latched or not. And we can't actually use the start of vblank
    interrupt to get us past that line as the interrupt would fire
    too soon, and then we'd up waiting for the next start of vblank
    instead. One way around that would using the frame start
    interrupt instead since that wouldn't fire until the next
    scanline, but that would require some bigger changes in the
    interrupt code. So for simplicity we'll just poll until we get
    past the bad line.

    tools/lib/lockdep: Reduce MAX_LOCK_DEPTH to avoid overflowing lock_chain/: Depth
    
    commit 98dcea0cfd04e083ac74137ceb9a632604740e2d upstream.
    
    liblockdep has been broken since commit 75dd602a5198 ("lockdep: Fix
    lock_chain::base size"), as that adds a check that MAX_LOCK_DEPTH is
    within the range of lock_chain::depth and in liblockdep it is much
    too large.
    
    That should have resulted in a compiler error, but didn't because:
    
    - the check uses ARRAY_SIZE(), which isn't yet defined in liblockdep
      so is assumed to be an (undeclared) function
    - putting a function call inside a BUILD_BUG_ON() expression quietly
      turns it into some nonsense involving a variable-length array
    
    It did produce a compiler warning, but I didn't notice because
    liblockdep already produces too many warnings if -Wall is enabled
    (which I'll fix shortly).
    
    Even before that commit, which reduced lock_chain::depth from 8 bits
    to 6, MAX_LOCK_DEPTH was too large.

    arm64: Preventing READ_IMPLIES_EXEC propagation
    
    commit 48f99c8ec0b25756d0283ab058826ae07d14fad7 upstream.
    
    Like arch/arm/, we inherit the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality flag across
    fork(). This is undesirable for a number of reasons:
    
      * ELF files that don't require executable stack can end up with it
        anyway
    
      * We end up performing un-necessary I-cache maintenance when mapping
        what should be non-executable pages
    
      * Restricting what is executable is generally desirable when defending
        against overflow attacks
    
    This patch clears the personality flag when setting up the personality for
    newly spwaned native tasks. Given that semi-recent AArch64 toolchains emit
    a non-executable PT_GNU_STACK header, userspace applications can already
    not rely on READ_IMPLIES_EXEC so shouldn't be adversely affected by this
    change.

    wlcore: fix 64K page support
    
    commit 4a4274bf2dbbd1c7a45be0c89a1687c9d2eef4a0 upstream.
    
    In the stable linux-3.16 branch, I ran into a warning in the
    wlcore driver:
    
    drivers/net/wireless/ti/wlcore/spi.c: In function 'wl12xx_spi_raw_write':
    drivers/net/wireless/ti/wlcore/spi.c:315:1: error: the frame size of 12848 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
    
    Newer kernels no longer show the warning, but the bug is still there,
    as the allocation is based on the CPU page size rather than the
    actual capabilities of the hardware.
    
    This replaces the PAGE_SIZE macro with the SZ_4K macro, i.e. 4096 bytes
    per buffer.

    mwifiex: fixup error cases in mwifiex_add_virtual_intf()
    
    commit 8535107aa4ef92520cbb9a4739563b389c5f8e2c upstream.
    
    If we fail to add an interface in mwifiex_add_virtual_intf(), we might
    hit a BUG_ON() in the networking code, because we didn't tear things
    down properly. Among the problems:
    
     (a) when failing to allocate workqueues, we fail to unregister the
         netdev before calling free_netdev()
     (b) even if we do try to unregister the netdev, we're still holding the
         rtnl lock, so the device never properly unregistered; we'll be at
         state NETREG_UNREGISTERING, and then hit free_netdev()'s:
            BUG_ON(dev->reg_state != NETREG_UNREGISTERED);
     (c) we're allocating some dependent resources (e.g., DFS workqueues)
         after we've registered the interface; this may or may not cause
         problems, but it's good practice to allocate these before registering
     (d) we're not even trying to unwind anything when mwifiex_send_cmd() or
         mwifiex_sta_init_cmd() fail
    
    To fix these issues, let's:
    
     * add a stacked set of error handling labels, to keep error handling
       consistent and properly ordered (resolving (a) and (d))
     * move the workqueue allocations before the registration (to resolve
       (c); also resolves (b) by avoiding error cases where we have to
       unregister)
    
    [Incidentally, it's pretty easy to interrupt the alloc_workqueue() in,
    e.g., the following:
    
      iw phy phy0 interface add mlan0 type station
    
    by sending it SIGTERM.]
    
    This bugfix covers commits like commit 7d652034d1a0 ("mwifiex: channel
    switch support for mwifiex"), but parts of this bug exist all the way
    back to the introduction of dynamic interface handling in commit

    sched/topology: Fix overlapping sched_group_capacity
    
    commit 1676330ecfa840113a37b25a49afda068380d19c upstream.
    
    When building the overlapping groups we need to attach a consistent
    sched_group_capacity structure. That is, all 'identical' sched_group's
    should have the _same_ sched_group_capacity.
    
    This can (once again) be demonstrated with a topology like:
    
      node   0   1   2   3
        0:  10  20  30  20
        1:  20  10  20  30
        2:  30  20  10  20
        3:  20  30  20  10
    
    But we need at least 2 CPUs per node for this to show up, after all,
    if there is only one CPU per node, our CPU @i is per definition a
    unique CPU that reaches this domain (aka balance-cpu).
    
    Given the above NUMA topo and 2 CPUs per node:
    
      [] CPU0 attaching sched-domain(s):
      []  domain-0: span=0,4 level=DIE
      []   groups: 0:{ span=0 }, 4:{ span=4 }
      []   domain-1: span=0-1,3-5,7 level=NUMA
      []    groups: 0:{ span=0,4 mask=0,4 cap=2048 }, 1:{ span=1,5 mask=1,5 cap=2048 }, 3:{ span=3,7 mask=3,7 cap=2048 }
      []    domain-2: span=0-7 level=NUMA
      []     groups: 0:{ span=0-1,3-5,7 mask=0,4 cap=6144 }, 2:{ span=1-3,5-7 mask=2,6 cap=6144 }
      [] CPU1 attaching sched-domain(s):
      []  domain-0: span=1,5 level=DIE
      []   groups: 1:{ span=1 }, 5:{ span=5 }
      []   domain-1: span=0-2,4-6 level=NUMA
      []    groups: 1:{ span=1,5 mask=1,5 cap=2048 }, 2:{ span=2,6 mask=2,6 cap=2048 }, 4:{ span=0,4 mask=0,4 cap=2048 }
      []    domain-2: span=0-7 level=NUMA
      []     groups: 1:{ span=0-2,4-6 mask=1,5 cap=6144 }, 3:{ span=0,2-4,6-7 mask=3,7 cap=6144 }
    
    Observe how CPU0-domain1-group0 and CPU1-domain1-group4 are the
    'same' but have a different id (0 vs 4).
    
    To fix this, use the group balance CPU to select the SGC. This means
    we have to compute the full mask for each CPU and require a second
    temporary mask to store the group mask in (it otherwise lives in the
    SGC).
    
    The fixed topology looks like:
    
      [] CPU0 attaching sched-domain(s):
      []  domain-0: span=0,4 level=DIE
      []   groups: 0:{ span=0 }, 4:{ span=4 }
      []   domain-1: span=0-1,3-5,7 level=NUMA
      []    groups: 0:{ span=0,4 mask=0,4 cap=2048 }, 1:{ span=1,5 mask=1,5 cap=2048 }, 3:{ span=3,7 mask=3,7 cap=2048 }
      []    domain-2: span=0-7 level=NUMA
      []     groups: 0:{ span=0-1,3-5,7 mask=0,4 cap=6144 }, 2:{ span=1-3,5-7 mask=2,6 cap=6144 }
      [] CPU1 attaching sched-domain(s):
      []  domain-0: span=1,5 level=DIE
      []   groups: 1:{ span=1 }, 5:{ span=5 }
      []   domain-1: span=0-2,4-6 level=NUMA
      []    groups: 1:{ span=1,5 mask=1,5 cap=2048 }, 2:{ span=2,6 mask=2,6 cap=2048 }, 0:{ span=0,4 mask=0,4 cap=2048 }
      []    domain-2: span=0-7 level=NUMA
      []     groups: 1:{ span=0-2,4-6 mask=1,5 cap=6144 }, 3:{ span=0,2-4,6-7 mask=3,7 cap=6144 }

    commit 73bb059f9b8a00c5e1bf2f7ca83138c05d05e600 upstream.
    
    The point of sched_group_mask is to select those CPUs from
    sched_group_cpus that can actually arrive at this balance domain.
    
    The current code gets it wrong, as can be readily demonstrated with a
    topology like:
    
      node   0   1   2   3
        0:  10  20  30  20
        1:  20  10  20  30
        2:  30  20  10  20
        3:  20  30  20  10
    
    Where (for example) domain 1 on CPU1 ends up with a mask that includes
    CPU0:
    
      [] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
      []  domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
      []   groups: 1 (mask: 1), 2, 0
      []   domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
      []    groups: 0-2 (mask: 0-2) (cpu_capacity: 3072), 0,2-3 (cpu_capacity: 3072)
    
    This causes sched_balance_cpu() to compute the wrong CPU and
    consequently should_we_balance() will terminate early resulting in
    missed load-balance opportunities.
    
    The fixed topology looks like:
    
      [] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
      []  domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
      []   groups: 1 (mask: 1), 2, 0
      []   domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
      []    groups: 0-2 (mask: 1) (cpu_capacity: 3072), 0,2-3 (cpu_capacity: 3072)
    
    (note: this relies on OVERLAP domains to always have children, this is
     true because the regular topology domains are still here -- this is
     before degenerate trimming)

    sched/topology: Fix building of overlapping sched-groups
    
    commit 0372dd2736e02672ac6e189c31f7d8c02ad543cd upstream.
    
    When building the overlapping groups, we very obviously should start
    with the previous domain of _this_ @cpu, not CPU-0.
    
    This can be readily demonstrated with a topology like:
    
      node   0   1   2   3
        0:  10  20  30  20
        1:  20  10  20  30
        2:  30  20  10  20
        3:  20  30  20  10
    
    Where (for example) CPU1 ends up generating the following nonsensical groups:
    
      [] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
      []  domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
      []   groups: 1 2 0
      []   domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
      []    groups: 1-3 (cpu_capacity = 3072) 0-1,3 (cpu_capacity = 3072)
    
    Where the fact that domain 1 doesn't include a group with span 0-2 is
    the obvious fail.
    
    With patch this looks like:
    
      [] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
      []  domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
      []   groups: 1 0 2
      []   domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
      []    groups: 0-2 (cpu_capacity = 3072) 0,2-3 (cpu_capacity = 3072)

    sched/fair, cpumask: Export for_each_cpu_wrap()
    
    commit c743f0a5c50f2fcbc628526279cfa24f3dabe182 upstream.
    
    More users for for_each_cpu_wrap() have appeared. Promote the construct
    to generic cpumask interface.
    
    The implementation is slightly modified to reduce arguments.

    sched: Rename a misleading variable in build_overlap_sched_groups()
    
    commit aaecac4ad46b35ad308245384d019633fb9bc21b upstream.
    
    The child variable in build_overlap_sched_groups() actually refers to the
    peer or sibling domain of the given CPU. Rename it to sibling to be consistent
    with the naming in build_group_mask().
