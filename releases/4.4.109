    n_tty: fix EXTPROC vs ICANON interaction with TIOCINQ (aka FIONREAD)
    
    commit 966031f340185eddd05affcf72b740549f056348 upstream.
    
    We added support for EXTPROC back in 2010 in commit 26df6d13406d ("tty:
    Add EXTPROC support for LINEMODE") and the intent was to allow it to
    override some (all?) ICANON behavior.  Quoting from that original commit
    message:
    
             There is a new bit in the termios local flag word, EXTPROC.
             When this bit is set, several aspects of the terminal driver
             are disabled.  Input line editing, character echo, and mapping
             of signals are all disabled.  This allows the telnetd to turn
             off these functions when in linemode, but still keep track of
             what state the user wants the terminal to be in.
    
    but the problem turns out that "several aspects of the terminal driver
    are disabled" is a bit ambiguous, and you can really confuse the n_tty
    layer by setting EXTPROC and then causing some of the ICANON invariants
    to no longer be maintained.
    
    This fixes at least one such case (TIOCINQ) becoming unhappy because of
    the confusion over whether ICANON really means ICANON when EXTPROC is set.
    
    This basically makes TIOCINQ match the case of read: if EXTPROC is set,
    we ignore ICANON.  Also, make sure to reset the ICANON state ie EXTPROC
    changes, not just if ICANON changes.

    x86/smpboot: Remove stale TLB flush invocations
    
    commit 322f8b8b340c824aef891342b0f5795d15e11562 upstream.
    
    smpboot_setup_warm_reset_vector() and smpboot_restore_warm_reset_vector()
    invoke local_flush_tlb() for no obvious reason.
    
    Digging in history revealed that the original code in the 2.1 era added
    those because the code manipulated a swapper_pg_dir pagetable entry. The
    pagetable manipulation was removed long ago in the 2.3 timeframe, but the
    TLB flush invocations stayed around forever.
    
    Remove them along with the pointless pr_debug()s which come from the same 2.1
    change.

    nohz: Prevent a timer interrupt storm in tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick()
    
    commit 5d62c183f9e9df1deeea0906d099a94e8a43047a upstream.
    
    The conditions in irq_exit() to invoke tick_nohz_irq_exit() which
    subsequently invokes tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick() are:
    
      if ((idle_cpu(cpu) && !need_resched()) || tick_nohz_full_cpu(cpu))
    
    If need_resched() is not set, but a timer softirq is pending then this is
    an indication that the softirq code punted and delegated the execution to
    softirqd. need_resched() is not true because the current interrupted task
    takes precedence over softirqd.
    
    Invoking tick_nohz_irq_exit() in this case can cause an endless loop of
    timer interrupts because the timer wheel contains an expired timer, but
    softirqs are not yet executed. So it returns an immediate expiry request,
    which causes the timer to fire immediately again. Lather, rinse and
    repeat....
    
    Prevent that by adding a check for a pending timer soft interrupt to the
    conditions in tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick() which avoid calling
    get_next_timer_interrupt(). That keeps the tick sched timer on the tick and
    prevents a repetitive programming of an already expired timer.

    USB: Fix off by one in type-specific length check of BOS SSP capability
    
    commit 07b9f12864d16c3a861aef4817eb1efccbc5d0e6 upstream.
    
    USB 3.1 devices are not detected as 3.1 capable since 4.15-rc3 due to a
    off by one in commit 81cf4a45360f ("USB: core: Add type-specific length
    check of BOS descriptors")
    
    It uses USB_DT_USB_SSP_CAP_SIZE() to get SSP capability size which takes
    the zero based SSAC as argument, not the actual count of sublink speed
    attributes.
    
    USB3 spec 9.6.2.5 says "The number of Sublink Speed Attributes = SSAC + 1."
    
    The type-specific length check patch was added to stable and needs to be
    fixed there as well

    but need sendsetup = true for the NMEA port to make it work properly.
    
    Simplify the patch compared to v1 as suggested by Bjørn Mork by taking
    advantage of the fact that existing devices work with sendsetup = true
    too.
    
    Use sendsetup = true for the NMEA interface of QCSERIAL_SWI and add
    DEVICE_SWI entries for the EM7565 PID 0x9091 and the EM7565 QDL PID
    0x9090.
    
    Tests with several MC73xx/MC74xx/MC77xx devices have been performed in
    order to verify backward compatibility.

    Also, put_net() on the right cpu may reorder with left's cpu
    list_replace_init(&cleanup_list, ..), and then cleanup_list
    will be corrupted.
    
    Since cleanup_net() is executed in worker thread, while
    put_net(peer) can happen everywhere, there should be
    enough time for concurrent get_net_ns_by_id() to pick
    the peer up, and the race does not seem to be unlikely.
    The patch fixes the problem in standard way.
    
    (Also, there is possible problem in peernet2id_alloc(), which requires
    check for net::count under nsid_lock and maybe_get_net(peer), but
    in current stable kernel it's used under rtnl_lock() and it has to be
    safe. Openswitch begun to use peernet2id_alloc(), and possibly it should
    be fixed too. While this is not in stable kernel yet, so I'll send
    a separate message to netdev@ later).

    net: bridge: fix early call to br_stp_change_bridge_id and plug newlink leaks
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 84aeb437ab98a2bce3d4b2111c79723aedfceb33 ]
    
    The early call to br_stp_change_bridge_id in bridge's newlink can cause
    a memory leak if an error occurs during the newlink because the fdb
    entries are not cleaned up if a different lladdr was specified, also
    another minor issue is that it generates fdb notifications with
    ifindex = 0. Another unrelated memory leak is the bridge sysfs entries
    which get added on NETDEV_REGISTER event, but are not cleaned up in the
    newlink error path. To remove this special case the call to
    br_stp_change_bridge_id is done after netdev register and we cleanup the
    bridge on changelink error via br_dev_delete to plug all leaks.
    
    This patch makes netlink bridge destruction on newlink error the same as
    dellink and ioctl del which is necessary since at that point we have a
    fully initialized bridge device.
    
    To reproduce the issue:
    $ ip l add br0 address 00:11:22:33:44:55 type bridge group_fwd_mask 1
    RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument

    ipv4: Fix use-after-free when flushing FIB tables
    
    
    [ Upstream commit b4681c2829e24943aadd1a7bb3a30d41d0a20050 ]
    
    Since commit 0ddcf43d5d4a ("ipv4: FIB Local/MAIN table collapse") the
    local table uses the same trie allocated for the main table when custom
    rules are not in use.
    
    When a net namespace is dismantled, the main table is flushed and freed
    (via an RCU callback) before the local table. In case the callback is
    invoked before the local table is iterated, a use-after-free can occur.
    
    Fix this by iterating over the FIB tables in reverse order, so that the
    main table is always freed after the local table.
    
    v3: Reworded comment according to Alex's suggestion.
    v2: Add a comment to make the fix more explicit per Dave's and Alex's
    feedback.

    tcp md5sig: Use skb's saddr when replying to an incoming segment
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 30791ac41927ebd3e75486f9504b6d2280463bf0 ]
    
    The MD5-key that belongs to a connection is identified by the peer's
    IP-address. When we are in tcp_v4(6)_reqsk_send_ack(), we are replying
    to an incoming segment from tcp_check_req() that failed the seq-number
    checks.
    
    Thus, to find the correct key, we need to use the skb's saddr and not
    the daddr.
    
    This bug seems to have been there since quite a while, but probably got
    unnoticed because the consequences are not catastrophic. We will call
    tcp_v4_reqsk_send_ack only to send a challenge-ACK back to the peer,
    thus the connection doesn't really fail.

    net: reevalulate autoflowlabel setting after sysctl setting
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 513674b5a2c9c7a67501506419da5c3c77ac6f08 ]
    
    sysctl.ip6.auto_flowlabels is default 1. In our hosts, we set it to 2.
    If sockopt doesn't set autoflowlabel, outcome packets from the hosts are
    supposed to not include flowlabel. This is true for normal packet, but
    not for reset packet.
    
    The reason is ipv6_pinfo.autoflowlabel is set in sock creation. Later if
    we change sysctl.ip6.auto_flowlabels, the ipv6_pinfo.autoflowlabel isn't
    changed, so the sock will keep the old behavior in terms of auto
    flowlabel. Reset packet is suffering from this problem, because reset
    packet is sent from a special control socket, which is created at boot
    time. Since sysctl.ipv6.auto_flowlabels is 1 by default, the control
    socket will always have its ipv6_pinfo.autoflowlabel set, even after
    user set sysctl.ipv6.auto_flowlabels to 1, so reset packset will always
    have flowlabel. Normal sock created before sysctl setting suffers from
    the same issue. We can't even turn off autoflowlabel unless we kill all
    socks in the hosts.
    
    To fix this, if IPV6_AUTOFLOWLABEL sockopt is used, we use the
    autoflowlabel setting from user, otherwise we always call
    ip6_default_np_autolabel() which has the new settings of sysctl.
    
    Note, this changes behavior a little bit. Before commit 42240901f7c4
    (ipv6: Implement different admin modes for automatic flow labels), the
    autoflowlabel behavior of a sock isn't sticky, eg, if sysctl changes,
    existing connection will change autoflowlabel behavior. After that
    commit, autoflowlabel behavior is sticky in the whole life of the sock.
    With this patch, the behavior isn't sticky again.

    netlink messages from its own netns.
    
    Test case:
    
        vpnns -- bash -c "ip link add nlmon0 type nlmon; \
                          ip link set nlmon0 up; \
                          tcpdump -i nlmon0 -q -w /tmp/nlmon.pcap -U" &
        sudo ip xfrm state add src 10.1.1.1 dst 10.1.1.2 proto esp \
            spi 0x1 mode transport \
            auth sha1 0x6162633132330000000000000000000000000000 \

    net: igmp: Use correct source address on IGMPv3 reports
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a46182b00290839fa3fa159d54fd3237bd8669f0 ]
    
    Closing a multicast socket after the final IPv4 address is deleted
    from an interface can generate a membership report that uses the
    source IP from a different interface.  The following test script, run
    from an isolated netns, reproduces the issue:
    
        #!/bin/bash
    
        ip link add dummy0 type dummy
        ip link add dummy1 type dummy
        ip link set dummy0 up
        ip link set dummy1 up
        ip addr add 10.1.1.1/24 dev dummy0
        ip addr add 192.168.99.99/24 dev dummy1
    
        tcpdump -U -i dummy0 &
        socat EXEC:"sleep 2" \
            UDP4-DATAGRAM:239.101.1.68:8889,ip-add-membership=239.0.1.68:10.1.1.1 &
    
        sleep 1
        ip addr del 10.1.1.1/24 dev dummy0
        sleep 5
        kill %tcpdump
    
    RFC 3376 specifies that the report must be sent with a valid IP source
    address from the destination subnet, or from address 0.0.0.0.  Add an
    extra check to make sure this is the case.

    ipv6: mcast: better catch silly mtu values

    kbuild: add '-fno-stack-check' to kernel build options
    
    commit 3ce120b16cc548472f80cf8644f90eda958cf1b6 upstream.
    
    It appears that hardened gentoo enables "-fstack-check" by default for
    gcc.
    
    That doesn't work _at_all_ for the kernel, because the kernel stack
    doesn't act like a user stack at all: it's much smaller, and it doesn't
    auto-expand on use.  So the extra "probe one page below the stack" code
    generated by -fstack-check just breaks the kernel in horrible ways,
    causing infinite double faults etc.
    
    [ I have to say, that the particular code gcc generates looks very
      stupid even for user space where it works, but that's a separate
      issue.  ]

    x86/mm/64: Fix reboot interaction with CR4.PCIDE
    
    commit 924c6b900cfdf376b07bccfd80e62b21914f8a5a upstream.
    
    Trying to reboot via real mode fails with PCID on: long mode cannot
    be exited while CR4.PCIDE is set.  (No, I have no idea why, but the
    SDM and actual CPUs are in agreement here.)  The result is a GPF and
    a hang instead of a reboot.
    
    I didn't catch this in testing because neither my computer nor my VM
    reboots this way.  I can trigger it with reboot=bios, though.

    By itself, this has no effect. A followup patch will start using PCID.

    x86/mm: Remove the UP asm/tlbflush.h code, always use the (formerly) SMP code
    
    commit ce4a4e565f5264909a18c733b864c3f74467f69e upstream.
    
    The UP asm/tlbflush.h generates somewhat nicer code than the SMP version.
    Aside from that, it's fallen quite a bit behind the SMP code:
    
     - flush_tlb_mm_range() didn't flush individual pages if the range
       was small.
    
     - The lazy TLB code was much weaker.  This usually wouldn't matter,
       but, if a kernel thread flushed its lazy "active_mm" more than
       once (due to reclaim or similar), it wouldn't be unlazied and
       would instead pointlessly flush repeatedly.
    
     - Tracepoints were missing.
    
    Aside from that, simply having the UP code around was a maintanence
    burden, since it means that any change to the TLB flush code had to
    make sure not to break it.
    
    Simplify everything by deleting the UP code.

    x86/mm: Reimplement flush_tlb_page() using flush_tlb_mm_range()
    
    commit ca6c99c0794875c6d1db6e22f246699691ab7e6b upstream.
    
    flush_tlb_page() was very similar to flush_tlb_mm_range() except that
    it had a couple of issues:
    
     - It was missing an smp_mb() in the case where
       current->active_mm != mm.  (This is a longstanding bug reported by Nadav Amit)
    
     - It was missing tracepoints and vm counter updates.
    
    The only reason that I can see for keeping it at as a separate
    function is that it could avoid a few branches that
    flush_tlb_mm_range() needs to decide to flush just one page.  This
    hardly seems worthwhile.  If we decide we want to get rid of those
    branches again, a better way would be to introduce an
    __flush_tlb_mm_range() helper and make both flush_tlb_page() and
    flush_tlb_mm_range() use it.

    x86/mm: Make flush_tlb_mm_range() more predictable
    
    commit ce27374fabf553153c3f53efcaa9bfab9216bd8c upstream.
    
    I'm about to rewrite the function almost completely, but first I
    want to get a functional change out of the way.  Currently, if
    flush_tlb_mm_range() does not flush the local TLB at all, it will
    never do individual page flushes on remote CPUs.  This seems to be
    an accident, and preserving it will be awkward.  Let's change it
    first so that any regressions in the rewrite will be easier to
    bisect and so that the rewrite can attempt to change no visible
    behavior at all.
    
    The fix is simple: we can simply avoid short-circuiting the
    calculation of base_pages_to_flush.
    
    As a side effect, this also eliminates a potential corner case: if
    tlb_single_page_flush_ceiling == TLB_FLUSH_ALL, flush_tlb_mm_range()
    could have ended up flushing the entire address space one page at a
    time.

    x86/mm: Remove flush_tlb() and flush_tlb_current_task()
    
    commit 29961b59a51f8c6838a26a45e871a7ed6771809b upstream.
    
    I was trying to figure out what how flush_tlb_current_task() would
    possibly work correctly if current->mm != current->active_mm, but I
    realized I could spare myself the effort: it has no callers except
    the unused flush_tlb() macro.

    x86/vm86/32: Switch to flush_tlb_mm_range() in mark_screen_rdonly()
    
    commit 9ccee2373f0658f234727700e619df097ba57023 upstream.
    
    mark_screen_rdonly() is the last remaining caller of flush_tlb().
    flush_tlb_mm_range() is potentially faster and isn't obsolete.
    
    Compile-tested only because I don't know whether software that uses
    this mechanism even exists.

    ring-buffer: Mask out the info bits when returning buffer page length
    
    commit 45d8b80c2ac5d21cd1e2954431fb676bc2b1e099 upstream.
    
    Two info bits were added to the "commit" part of the ring buffer data page
    when returned to be consumed. This was to inform the user space readers that
    events have been missed, and that the count may be stored at the end of the
    page.
    
    What wasn't handled, was the splice code that actually called a function to
    return the length of the data in order to zero out the rest of the page
    before sending it up to user space. These data bits were returned with the
    length making the value negative, and that negative value was not checked.
    It was compared to PAGE_SIZE, and only used if the size was less than
    PAGE_SIZE. Luckily PAGE_SIZE is unsigned long which made the compare an
    unsigned compare, meaning the negative size value did not end up causing a
    large portion of memory to be randomly zeroed out.

    tracing: Fix crash when it fails to alloc ring buffer
    
    commit 24f2aaf952ee0b59f31c3a18b8b36c9e3d3c2cf5 upstream.
    
    Double free of the ring buffer happens when it fails to alloc new
    ring buffer instance for max_buffer if TRACER_MAX_TRACE is configured.
    The root cause is that the pointer is not set to NULL after the buffer
    is freed in allocate_trace_buffers(), and the freeing of the ring
    buffer is invoked again later if the pointer is not equal to Null,
    as:
    
    instance_mkdir()
        |-allocate_trace_buffers()
            |-allocate_trace_buffer(tr, &tr->trace_buffer...)
            |-allocate_trace_buffer(tr, &tr->max_buffer...)
    
              // allocate fail(-ENOMEM),first free
              // and the buffer pointer is not set to null
            |-ring_buffer_free(tr->trace_buffer.buffer)
    
           // out_free_tr
        |-free_trace_buffers()
            |-free_trace_buffer(&tr->trace_buffer);
    
                  //if trace_buffer is not null, free again
                |-ring_buffer_free(buf->buffer)
                    |-rb_free_cpu_buffer(buffer->buffers[cpu])
                        // ring_buffer_per_cpu is null, and
                        // crash in ring_buffer_per_cpu->pages

    kvm: x86: fix RSM when PCID is non-zero
    
    commit fae1a3e775cca8c3a9e0eb34443b310871a15a92 upstream.
    
    rsm_load_state_64() and rsm_enter_protected_mode() load CR3, then
    CR4 & ~PCIDE, then CR0, then CR4.
    
    However, setting CR4.PCIDE fails if CR3[11:0] != 0.  It's probably easier
    in the long run to replace rsm_enter_protected_mode() with an emulator
    callback that sets all the special registers (like KVM_SET_SREGS would
    do).  For now, set the PCID field of CR3 only after CR4.PCIDE is 1.

    spi: xilinx: Detect stall with Unknown commands
    
    commit 5a1314fa697fc65cefaba64cd4699bfc3e6882a6 upstream.
    
    When the core is configured in C_SPI_MODE > 0, it integrates a
    lookup table that automatically configures the core in dual or quad mode
    based on the command (first byte on the tx fifo).
    
    Unfortunately, that list mode_?_memoy_*.mif does not contain all the
    supported commands by the flash.
    
    Since 4.14 spi-nor automatically tries to probe the flash using SFDP
    (command 0x5a), and that command is not part of the list_mode table.
    
    Whit the right combination of C_SPI_MODE and C_SPI_MEMORY this leads
    into a stall that can only be recovered with a soft rest.
    
    This patch detects this kind of stall and returns -EIO to the caller on
    those commands. spi-nor can handle this error properly:
    
    m25p80 spi0.0: Detected stall. Check C_SPI_MODE and C_SPI_MEMORY. 0x21 0x2404
    m25p80 spi0.0: SPI transfer failed: -5

    PCI / PM: Force devices to D0 in pci_pm_thaw_noirq()
    
    commit 5839ee7389e893a31e4e3c9cf17b50d14103c902 upstream.
    
    It is incorrect to call pci_restore_state() for devices in low-power
    states (D1-D3), as that involves the restoration of MSI setup which
    requires MMIO to be operational and that is only the case in D0.
    
    However, pci_pm_thaw_noirq() may do that if the driver's "freeze"
    callbacks put the device into a low-power state, so fix it by making
    it force devices into D0 via pci_set_power_state() instead of trying
    to "update" their power state which is pointless.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix the missing ctl name suffix at parsing SU
    
    commit 5a15f289ee87eaf33f13f08a4909ec99d837ec5f upstream.
    
    The commit 89b89d121ffc ("ALSA: usb-audio: Add check return value for
    usb_string()") added the check of the return value from
    snd_usb_copy_string_desc(), which is correct per se, but it introduced
    a regression.  In the original code, either the "Clock Source",
    "Playback Source" or "Capture Source" suffix is added after the
    terminal string, while the commit changed it to add the suffix only
    when get_term_name() is failing.  It ended up with an incorrect ctl
    name like "PCM" instead of "PCM Capture Source".
    
    Also, even the original code has a similar bug: when the ctl name is
    generated from snd_usb_copy_string_desc() for the given iSelector, it
    also doesn't put the suffix.
    
    This patch addresses these issues: the suffix is added always when no
    static mapping is found.  Also the patch tries to put more comments
    and cleans up the if/else block for better readability in order to
    avoid the same pitfall again.

    ALSA: rawmidi: Avoid racy info ioctl via ctl device
    
    commit c1cfd9025cc394fd137a01159d74335c5ac978ce upstream.
    
    The rawmidi also allows to obtaining the information via ioctl of ctl
    API.  It means that user can issue an ioctl to the rawmidi device even
    when it's being removed as long as the control device is present.
    Although the code has some protection via the global register_mutex,
    its range is limited to the search of the corresponding rawmidi
    object, and the mutex is already unlocked at accessing the rawmidi
    object.  This may lead to a use-after-free.
    
    For avoiding it, this patch widens the application of register_mutex
    to the whole snd_rawmidi_info_select() function.  We have another
    mutex per rawmidi object, but this operation isn't very hot path, so
    it shouldn't matter from the performance POV.

    Fix child-node lookup during probe, which ended up searching the whole
    device tree depth-first starting at the parent rather than just matching
    on its children.
    
    To make things worse, the parent node was prematurely freed, while the
    child node was leaked.
    
    Note that the CONFIG_OF compile guard can be removed as
    of_get_child_by_name() provides a !CONFIG_OF implementation which always
    fails.

    mfd: cros ec: spi: Don't send first message too soon
    
    commit 15d8374874ded0bec37ef27f8301a6d54032c0e5 upstream.
    
    On the Tegra124 Nyan-Big chromebook the very first SPI message sent to
    the EC is failing.
    
    The Tegra SPI driver configures the SPI chip-selects to be active-high
    by default (and always has for many years). The EC SPI requires an
    active-low chip-select and so the Tegra chip-select is reconfigured to
    be active-low when the EC SPI driver calls spi_setup(). The problem is
    that if the first SPI message to the EC is sent too soon after
    reconfiguring the SPI chip-select, it fails.
    
    The EC SPI driver prevents back-to-back SPI messages being sent too
    soon by keeping track of the time the last transfer was sent via the
    variable 'last_transfer_ns'. To prevent the very first transfer being
    sent too soon, initialise the 'last_transfer_ns' variable after calling
    spi_setup() and before sending the first SPI message.

    crypto: mcryptd - protect the per-CPU queue with a lock
    
    commit 9abffc6f2efe46c3564c04312e52e07622d40e51 upstream.
    
    mcryptd_enqueue_request() grabs the per-CPU queue struct and protects
    access to it with disabled preemption. Then it schedules a worker on the
    same CPU. The worker in mcryptd_queue_worker() guards access to the same
    per-CPU variable with disabled preemption.
    
    If we take CPU-hotplug into account then it is possible that between
    queue_work_on() and the actual invocation of the worker the CPU goes
    down and the worker will be scheduled on _another_ CPU. And here the
    preempt_disable() protection does not work anymore. The easiest thing is
    to add a spin_lock() to guard access to the list.
    
    Another detail: mcryptd_queue_worker() is not processing more than
    MCRYPTD_BATCH invocation in a row. If there are still items left, then
    it will invoke queue_work() to proceed with more later. *I* would
    suggest to simply drop that check because it does not use a system
    workqueue and the workqueue is already marked as "CPU_INTENSIVE". And if
    preemption is required then the scheduler should do it.
    However if queue_work() is used then the work item is marked as CPU
    unbound. That means it will try to run on the local CPU but it may run
    on another CPU as well. Especially with CONFIG_DEBUG_WQ_FORCE_RR_CPU=y.
    Again, the preempt_disable() won't work here but lock which was
    introduced will help.
    In order to keep work-item on the local CPU (and avoid RR) I changed it
    to queue_work_on().

    ACPI: APEI / ERST: Fix missing error handling in erst_reader()
    
    commit bb82e0b4a7e96494f0c1004ce50cec3d7b5fb3d1 upstream.
    
    The commit f6f828513290 ("pstore: pass allocated memory region back to
    caller") changed the check of the return value from erst_read() in
    erst_reader() in the following way:
    
            if (len == -ENOENT)
                    goto skip;
    -       else if (len < 0) {
    -               rc = -1;
    +       else if (len < sizeof(*rcd)) {
    +               rc = -EIO;
                    goto out;
    
    This introduced another bug: since the comparison with sizeof() is
    cast to unsigned, a negative len value doesn't hit any longer.
    As a result, when an error is returned from erst_read(), the code
    falls through, and it may eventually lead to some weird thing like
    memory corruption.
    
    This patch adds the negative error value check more explicitly for
    addressing the issue.
