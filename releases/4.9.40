    alarmtimer: don't rate limit one-shot timers
    
    Commit ff86bf0c65f1 ("alarmtimer: Rate limit periodic intervals") sets a
    minimum bound on the alarm timer interval.  This minimum bound shouldn't
    be applied if the interval is 0.  Otherwise, one-shot timers will be
    converted into periodic ones.

    PM / Domains: defer dev_pm_domain_set() until genpd->attach_dev succeeds if present
    
    commit 975e83cfb8dc16e7a2fdc58188c77c0c605876c2 upstream.
    
    If the genpd->attach_dev or genpd->power_on fails, genpd_dev_pm_attach
    may return -EPROBE_DEFER initially. However genpd_alloc_dev_data sets
    the PM domain for the device unconditionally.
    
    When subsequent attempts are made to call genpd_dev_pm_attach, it may
    return -EEXISTS checking dev->pm_domain without re-attempting to call
    attach_dev or power_on.
    
    platform_drv_probe then attempts to call drv->probe as the return value
    -EEXIST != -EPROBE_DEFER, which may end up in a situation where the
    device is accessed without it's power domain switched on.

    reiserfs: Don't clear SGID when inheriting ACLs
    
    commit 6883cd7f68245e43e91e5ee583b7550abf14523f upstream.
    
    When new directory 'DIR1' is created in a directory 'DIR0' with SGID bit
    set, DIR1 is expected to have SGID bit set (and owning group equal to
    the owning group of 'DIR0'). However when 'DIR0' also has some default
    ACLs that 'DIR1' inherits, setting these ACLs will result in SGID bit on
    'DIR1' to get cleared if user is not member of the owning group.
    
    Fix the problem by moving posix_acl_update_mode() out of
    __reiserfs_set_acl() into reiserfs_set_acl(). That way the function will
    not be called when inheriting ACLs which is what we want as it prevents
    SGID bit clearing and the mode has been properly set by
    posix_acl_create() anyway.

    nfit_init() calls nfit_mce_register() on module load.  When the module
    load fails the nfit mce decoder is not unregistered.  The module's

    drm/mst: Avoid processing partially received up/down message transactions
    
    commit 636c4c3e762b62aa93632c645ca65879285b16e3 upstream.
    
    Currently we may process up/down message transactions containing
    uninitialized data. This can happen if there was an error during the
    reception of any message in the transaction, but we happened to receive
    the last message correctly with the end-of-message flag set.
    
    To avoid this abort the reception of the transaction when the first
    error is detected, rejecting any messages until a message with the
    start-of-message flag is received (which will start a new transaction).
    This is also what the DP 1.4 spec 2.11.8.2 calls for in this case.
    
    In addtion this also prevents receiving bogus transactions without the
    first message with the the start-of-message flag set.
    
    v2:
    - unchanged
    v3:
    - git add the part that actually skips messages after an error in
      drm_dp_sideband_msg_build()

    ceph: fix race in concurrent readdir
    
    commit 84583cfb973c4313955c6231cc9cb3772d280b15 upstream.
    
    For a large directory, program needs to issue multiple readdir
    syscalls to get all dentries. When there are multiple programs
    read the directory concurrently. Following sequence of events
    can happen.
    
     - program calls readdir with pos = 2. ceph sends readdir request
       to mds. The reply contains N1 entries. ceph adds these N1 entries
       to readdir cache.
     - program calls readdir with pos = N1+2. The readdir is satisfied
       by the readdir cache, N2 entries are returned. (Other program
       calls readdir in the middle, which fills the cache)
     - program calls readdir with pos = N1+N2+2. ceph sends readdir
       request to mds. The reply contains N3 entries and it reaches
       directory end. ceph adds these N3 entries to the readdir cache
       and marks directory complete.
    
    The second readdir call does not update fi->readdir_cache_idx.
    ceph add the last N3 entries to wrong places.

    If vesafb is enabled in the config then /dev/fb0 is created by vesa

    'Did a quick research into "why".
    The patch d8801e4df91e ("x86/PCI: Set IORESOURCE_ROM_SHADOW only for the

    for a default VGA device and that is being done only for x86.
    And so, we will need that #ifdef to check IORESOURCE_ROM_SHADOW as that
    needs to be checked only for a x86 and not for other arch.'

    staging: comedi: ni_mio_common: fix AO timer off-by-one regression
    
    commit 15d5193104a457d5151840247e3bce561c42e3e9 upstream.
    
    As reported by Éric Piel on the Comedi mailing list (see
    <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comedi_list/ueZiR7vTLOU/discussion>),
    the analog output asynchronous commands are running too fast with a
    period 50 ns shorter than it should be.  This affects all boards with AO
    command support that are supported by the "ni_pcimio", "ni_atmio", and
    "ni_mio_cs" drivers.
    
    This is a regression bug introduced by commit 080e6795cba3 ("staging:
    comedi: ni_mio_common: Cleans up/clarifies ni_ao_cmd"), specifically,
    this line in `ni_ao_cmd_set_update()`:
    
                    /* following line: N-1 per STC */
                    ni_stc_writel(dev, trigvar - 1, NISTC_AO_UI_LOADA_REG);
    
    The `trigvar` variable value comes from a call to `ni_ns_to_timer()`
    which converts a timer period in nanoseconds to a hardware divisor
    value. The function already reduces the divisor by 1 as required by the
    hardware, so the above line should not reduce it further by 1.  Fix it
    by replacing `trigvar` by `trigvar - 1` in the above line, and remove
    the misleading comment.

    commit 6a8a75f3235724c5941a33e287b2f98966ad14c5 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit cc1582c231ea041fbc68861dfaf957eaf902b829.
    
    This commit introduced a regression that broke rr-project, which uses sampling
    events to receive a signal on overflow (but does not care about the contents
    of the sample). These signals are critical to the correct operation of rr.
    
    There's been some back and forth about how to fix it - but to not keep
    applications in limbo queue up a revert.

    iser-target: Avoid isert_conn->cm_id dereference in isert_login_recv_done
    
    commit fce50a2fa4e9c6e103915c351b6d4a98661341d6 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference in isert_login_recv_done()
    of isert_conn->cm_id due to isert_cma_handler() -> isert_connect_error()
    resetting isert_conn->cm_id = NULL during a failed login attempt.
    
    As per Sagi, we will always see the completion of all recv wrs posted
    on the qp (given that we assigned a ->done handler), this is a FLUSH
    error completion, we just don't get to verify that because we deref
    NULL before.
    
    The issue here, was the assumption that dereferencing the connection
    cm_id is always safe, which is not true since:

             iser-target: Fix possible deadlock in RDMA_CM connection error
    
    As I see it, we have a direct reference to the isert_device from
    isert_conn which is the one-liner fix that we actually need like
    we do in isert_rdma_read_done() and isert_rdma_write_done().

    target: Fix COMPARE_AND_WRITE caw_sem leak during se_cmd quiesce
    
    commit 1d6ef276594a781686058802996e09c8550fd767 upstream.
    
    This patch addresses a COMPARE_AND_WRITE se_device->caw_sem leak,
    that would be triggered during normal se_cmd shutdown or abort
    via __transport_wait_for_tasks().
    
    This would occur because target_complete_cmd() would catch this
    early and do complete_all(&cmd->t_transport_stop_comp), but since
    target_complete_ok_work() or target_complete_failure_work() are
    never called to invoke se_cmd->transport_complete_callback(),
    the COMPARE_AND_WRITE specific callbacks never release caw_sem.
    
    To address this special case, go ahead and release caw_sem
    directly from target_complete_cmd().
    
    (Remove '&& success' from check, to release caw_sem regardless
     of scsi_status - nab)

    udf: Fix deadlock between writeback and udf_setsize()
    
    commit f2e95355891153f66d4156bf3a142c6489cd78c6 upstream.
    
    udf_setsize() called truncate_setsize() with i_data_sem held. Thus
    truncate_pagecache() called from truncate_setsize() could lock a page
    under i_data_sem which can deadlock as page lock ranks below
    i_data_sem - e. g. writeback can hold page lock and try to acquire
    i_data_sem to map a block.
    
    Fix the problem by moving truncate_setsize() calls from under
    i_data_sem. It is safe for us to change i_size without holding
    i_data_sem as all the places that depend on i_size being stable already
    hold inode_lock.

    NFS: only invalidate dentrys that are clearly invalid.
    
    commit cc89684c9a265828ce061037f1f79f4a68ccd3f7 upstream.
    
    Since commit bafc9b754f75 ("vfs: More precise tests in d_invalidate")
    in v3.18, a return of '0' from ->d_revalidate() will cause the dentry
    to be invalidated even if it has filesystems mounted on or it or on a
    descendant.  The mounted filesystem is unmounted.
    
    This means we need to be careful not to return 0 unless the directory
    referred to truly is invalid.  So -ESTALE or -ENOENT should invalidate
    the directory.  Other errors such a -EPERM or -ERESTARTSYS should be
    returned from ->d_revalidate() so they are propagated to the caller.
    
    A particular problem can be demonstrated by:
    
    1/ mount an NFS filesystem using NFSv3 on /mnt
    2/ mount any other filesystem on /mnt/foo
    3/ ls /mnt/foo
    4/ turn off network, or otherwise make the server unable to respond
    5/ ls /mnt/foo &
    6/ cat /proc/$!/stack # note that nfs_lookup_revalidate is in the call stack
    7/ kill -9 $! # this results in -ERESTARTSYS being returned
    8/ observe that /mnt/foo has been unmounted.
    
    This patch changes nfs_lookup_revalidate() to only treat
      -ESTALE from nfs_lookup_verify_inode() and
      -ESTALE or -ENOENT from ->lookup()
    as indicating an invalid inode.  Other errors are returned.
    
    Also nfs_check_inode_attributes() is changed to return -ESTALE rather
    than -EIO.  This is consistent with the error returned in similar
    circumstances from nfs_update_inode().
    
    As this bug allows any user to unmount a filesystem mounted on an NFS
    filesystem, this fix is suitable for stable kernels.

    so that the `sigill_r6' name is freed for the situation where an R6

    MIPS: math-emu: Prevent wrong ISA mode instruction emulation
    
    commit 13769ebad0c42738831787e27c7c7f982e7da579 upstream.
    
    Terminate FPU emulation immediately whenever an ISA mode switch has been
    observed.  This is so that we do not interpret machine code in the wrong
    mode, for example when a regular MIPS FPU instruction has been placed in
    a delay slot of a jump that switches into the MIPS16 mode, as with the

      40131a:       e8a0            jrc     ra
    
    Here `set_fast_math' is called from `40130e' (`40130f' with the ISA bit)
    and emulation triggers for the CTC1 instruction.  As it is in a jump
    delay slot emulation continues from `401312' (`401313' with the ISA
    bit).  However we have no path to handle MIPS16 FPU code emulation,
    because there are no MIPS16 FPU instructions.  So the default emulation
    path is taken, interpreting a 32-bit word fetched by `get_user' from
    `401313' as a regular MIPS instruction, which is:
    
      401313:       f5ea0a92        sdc1    $f10,2706(t7)
    
    This makes the FPU emulator proceed with the supposed SDC1 instruction
    and consequently makes the program considered here terminate with
    SIGSEGV.
    
    A similar although less severe issue exists with pure-microMIPS
    processors in the case where similarly an FPU instruction is emulated in
    a delay slot of a register jump that (incorrectly) switches into the
    regular MIPS mode.  A subsequent instruction fetch from the jump's
    target is supposed to cause an Address Error exception, however instead
    we proceed with regular MIPS FPU emulation.
    
    For simplicity then, always terminate the emulation loop whenever a mode
    change is detected, denoted by an ISA mode bit flip.  As from commit
    377cb1b6c16a ("MIPS: Disable MIPS16/microMIPS crap for platforms not
    supporting these ASEs.") the result of `get_isa16_mode' can be hardcoded
    to 0, so we need to examine the ISA mode bit by hand.
    
    This complements commit 102cedc32a6e ("MIPS: microMIPS: Floating point
    support.") which added JALX decoding to FPU emulation.

    MIPS: Fix unaligned PC interpretation in `compute_return_epc'
    
    commit 11a3799dbeb620bf0400b1fda5cc2c6bea55f20a upstream.
    
    Fix a regression introduced with commit fb6883e5809c ("MIPS: microMIPS:
    Support handling of delay slots.") and defer to `__compute_return_epc'
    if the ISA bit is set in EPC with non-MIPS16, non-microMIPS hardware,
    which will then arrange for a SIGBUS due to an unaligned instruction
    reference.  Returning EPC here is never correct as the API defines this
    function's result to be either a negative error code on failure or one
    of 0 and BRANCH_LIKELY_TAKEN on success.

    MIPS: Save static registers before sysmips
    
    commit 49955d84cd9ccdca5a16a495e448e1a06fad9e49 upstream.
    
    The MIPS sysmips system call handler may return directly from the
    MIPS_ATOMIC_SET case (mips_atomic_set()) to syscall_exit. This path
    restores the static (callee saved) registers, however they won't have
    been saved on entry to the system call.
    
    Use the save_static_function() macro to create a __sys_sysmips wrapper
    function which saves the static registers before calling sys_sysmips, so
    that the correct static register state is restored by syscall_exit.

    Correct a commit 515a6393dbac ("MIPS: kernel: proc: Add MIPS R6 support
    to /proc/cpuinfo") regression that caused MIPS I systems to show no ISA
    levels supported in /proc/cpuinfo, e.g.:
    
    system type             : Digital DECstation 2100/3100
    machine                 : Unknown
    processor               : 0
    cpu model               : R3000 V2.0  FPU V2.0
    BogoMIPS                : 10.69
    wait instruction        : no
    microsecond timers      : no
    tlb_entries             : 64
    extra interrupt vector  : no
    hardware watchpoint     : no
    isa                     :
    ASEs implemented        :
    shadow register sets    : 1
    kscratch registers      : 0
    package                 : 0
    core                    : 0
    VCED exceptions         : not available
    VCEI exceptions         : not available
    
    and similarly exclude `mips1' from the ISA list for any processors below
    MIPSr1.  This is because the condition to show `mips1' on has been made
    `cpu_has_mips_r1' rather than newly-introduced `cpu_has_mips_1'.  Use
    the correct condition then.

    x86/ioapic: Pass the correct data to unmask_ioapic_irq()
    
    commit e708e35ba6d89ff785b225cd07dcccab04fa954a upstream.
    
    One of the rarely executed code pathes in check_timer() calls
    unmask_ioapic_irq() passing irq_get_chip_data(0) as argument.
    
    That's wrong as unmask_ioapic_irq() expects a pointer to the irq data of
    interrupt 0. irq_get_chip_data(0) returns NULL, so the following
    dereference in unmask_ioapic_irq() causes a kernel panic.
    
    The issue went unnoticed in the first place because irq_get_chip_data()
    returns a void pointer so the compiler cannot do a type check on the
    argument. The code path was added for machines with broken configuration,
    but it seems that those machines are either not running current kernels or
    simply do not longer exist.
    
    Hand in irq_get_irq_data(0) as argument which provides the correct data.

    x86/acpi: Prevent out of bound access caused by broken ACPI tables
    
    commit dad5ab0db8deac535d03e3fe3d8f2892173fa6a4 upstream.
    
    The bus_irq argument of mp_override_legacy_irq() is used as the index into
    the isa_irq_to_gsi[] array. The bus_irq argument originates from
    ACPI_MADT_TYPE_IO_APIC and ACPI_MADT_TYPE_INTERRUPT items in the ACPI
    tables, but is nowhere sanity checked.
    
    That allows broken or malicious ACPI tables to overwrite memory, which
    might cause malfunction, panic or arbitrary code execution.
    
    Add a sanity check and emit a warning when that triggers.

    Revert "ACPI / EC: Enable event freeze mode..." to fix a regression
    
    commit 9c40f956ce9b331493347d1b3cb7e384f7dc0581 upstream.
    
    On Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon - the 5th Generation, enabling an earlier
    EC event freezing timing causes acpitz-virtual-0 to report a stuck
    48C temparature.  And with EC firmware revisioned as 1.14, without
    reverting back to old EC event freezing timing, the fan still blows
    up after a system resume.
    
    This reverts the culprit change so that the regression can be fixed
    without upgrading the EC firmware.

    ACPI / EC: Drop EC noirq hooks to fix a regression
    
    commit 662591461c4b9a1e3b9b159dbf37648a585ebaae upstream.
    
    According to bug reports, although the busy polling mode can make
    noirq stages execute faster, it causes abnormal fan blowing up after
    system resume (see the first link below for a video demonstration)
    on Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon - the 5th Generation.  The problem can
    be fixed by upgrading the EC firmware on that machine.
    
    However, many reporters confirm that the problem can be fixed by
    stopping busy polling during suspend/resume and for some of them
    upgrading the EC firmware is not an option.
    
    For this reason, drop the noirq stage hooks from the EC driver
    to fix the regression.

    ubifs: Don't leak kernel memory to the MTD
    
    commit 4acadda74ff8b949c448c0282765ae747e088c87 upstream.
    
    When UBIFS prepares data structures which will be written to the MTD it
    ensues that their lengths are multiple of 8. Since it uses kmalloc() the
    padded bytes are left uninitialized and we leak a few bytes of kernel
    memory to the MTD.
    To make sure that all bytes are initialized, let's switch to kzalloc().
    Kzalloc() is fine in this case because the buffers are not huge and in
    the IO path the performance bottleneck is anyway the MTD.

    MIPS: Negate error syscall return in trace
    
    commit 4f32a39d49b25eaa66d2420f1f03d371ea4cd906 upstream.
    
    The sys_exit trace event takes a single return value for the system
    call, which MIPS passes the value of the $v0 (result) register, however
    MIPS returns positive error codes in $v0 with $a3 specifying that $v0
    contains an error code. As a result erroring system calls are traced
    returning positive error numbers that can't always be distinguished from
    success.
    
    Use regs_return_value() to negate the error code if $a3 is set.

    MIPS: Fix mips_atomic_set() retry condition
    
    commit 2ec420b26f7b6ff332393f0bb5a7d245f7ad87f0 upstream.
    
    The inline asm retry check in the MIPS_ATOMIC_SET operation of the
    sysmips system call has been backwards since commit f1e39a4a616c ("MIPS:
    Rewrite sysmips(MIPS_ATOMIC_SET, ...) in C with inline assembler")
    merged in v2.6.32, resulting in the non R10000_LLSC_WAR case retrying
    until the operation was inatomic, before returning the new value that
    was probably just written multiple times instead of the old value.
    
    Invert the branch condition to fix that particular issue.

    vfio: New external user group/file match
    
    commit 5d6dee80a1e94cc284d03e06d930e60e8d3ecf7d upstream.
    
    At the point where the kvm-vfio pseudo device wants to release its
    vfio group reference, we can't always acquire a new reference to make
    that happen.  The group can be in a state where we wouldn't allow a
    new reference to be added.  This new helper function allows a caller
    to match a file to a group to facilitate this.  Given a file and
    group, report if they match.  Thus the caller needs to already have a
    group reference to match to the file.  This allows the deletion of a
    group without acquiring a new reference.

    xfs: Don't clear SGID when inheriting ACLs
    
    commit 8ba358756aa08414fa9e65a1a41d28304ed6fd7f upstream.
    
    When new directory 'DIR1' is created in a directory 'DIR0' with SGID bit
    set, DIR1 is expected to have SGID bit set (and owning group equal to
    the owning group of 'DIR0'). However when 'DIR0' also has some default
    ACLs that 'DIR1' inherits, setting these ACLs will result in SGID bit on
    'DIR1' to get cleared if user is not member of the owning group.
    
    Fix the problem by calling __xfs_set_acl() instead of xfs_set_acl() when
    setting up inode in xfs_generic_create(). That prevents SGID bit
    clearing and mode is properly set by posix_acl_create() anyway. We also
    reorder arguments of __xfs_set_acl() to match the ordering of
    xfs_set_acl() to make things consistent.

    drm/radeon: Fix eDP for single-display iMac10,1 (v2)
    
    commit 564d8a2cf3abf16575af48bdc3e86e92ee8a617d upstream.
    
    The late 2009, 27 inch Apple iMac10,1 has an
    internal eDP display and an external Mini-
    Displayport output, driven by a DCE-3.2, RV730
    Radeon Mobility HD-4670.
    
    The machine worked fine in a dual-display setup
    with eDP panel + externally connected HDMI
    or DVI-D digital display sink, connected via
    MiniDP to DVI or HDMI adapter.
    
    However, booting the machine single-display with
    only eDP panel results in a completely black
    display - even backlight powering off, as soon as
    the radeon modesetting driver loads.
    
    This patch fixes the single dispay eDP case by
    assigning encoders based on dig->linkb, similar
    to DCE-4+. While this should not be generally
    necessary (Alex: "...atom on normal boards
    should be able to handle any mapping."), Apple
    seems to use some special routing here.
    
    One remaining problem not solved by this patch
    is that an external Minidisplayport->DP sink
    does still not work on iMac10,1, whereas external
    DVI and HDMI sinks continue to work.
    
    The problem affects at least all tested kernels
    since Linux 3.13 - didn't test earlier kernels, so
    backporting to stable probably makes sense.
    
    v2: With the original patch from 2016, Alex was worried it
        will break other DCE3.2 systems. Use dmi_match() to
        apply this special encoder assignment only for the
        Apple iMac 10,1 from late 2009.

    Raid5 should update rdev->sectors after reshape
    
    commit b5d27718f38843a74552e9a93d32e2391fd3999f upstream.
    
    The raid5 md device is created by the disks which we don't use the total size. For example,
    the size of the device is 5G and it just uses 3G of the devices to create one raid5 device.
    Then change the chunksize and wait reshape to finish. After reshape finishing stop the raid
    and assemble it again. It fails.
    mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -l5 -n3 /dev/loop[0-2] --size=3G --chunk=32 --assume-clean
    mdadm /dev/md0 --grow --chunk=64
    wait reshape to finish
    mdadm -S /dev/md0
    mdadm -As
    The error messages:
    [197519.814302] md: loop1 does not have a valid v1.2 superblock, not importing!
    [197519.821686] md: md_import_device returned -22
    
    After reshape the data offset is changed. It selects backwards direction in this condition.
    In function super_1_load it compares the available space of the underlying device with
    sb->data_size. The new data offset gets bigger after reshape. So super_1_load returns -EINVAL.
    rdev->sectors is updated in md_finish_reshape. Then sb->data_size is set in super_1_sync based
    on rdev->sectors. So add md_finish_reshape in end_reshape.

    ext2: Don't clear SGID when inheriting ACLs
    
    commit a992f2d38e4ce17b8c7d1f7f67b2de0eebdea069 upstream.
    
    When new directory 'DIR1' is created in a directory 'DIR0' with SGID bit
    set, DIR1 is expected to have SGID bit set (and owning group equal to
    the owning group of 'DIR0'). However when 'DIR0' also has some default
    ACLs that 'DIR1' inherits, setting these ACLs will result in SGID bit on
    'DIR1' to get cleared if user is not member of the owning group.
    
    Fix the problem by creating __ext2_set_acl() function that does not call
    posix_acl_update_mode() and use it when inheriting ACLs. That prevents
    SGID bit clearing and the mode has been properly set by
    posix_acl_create() anyway.

    libnvdimm: fix badblock range handling of ARS range
    
    commit 4e3f0701f25ab194c5362576b1146a1e6cc6c2e7 upstream.
    
    __add_badblock_range() does not account sector alignment when
    it sets 'num_sectors'.  Therefore, an ARS error record range
    spanning across two sectors is set to a single sector length,
    which leaves the 2nd sector unprotected.
    
    Change __add_badblock_range() to set 'num_sectors' properly.

    cx88: Fix regression in initial video standard setting
    
    commit 4e0973a918b9a42e217093f078e04a61e5dd95a5 upstream.
    
    Setting initial standard at the top of cx8800_initdev would cause the
    first call to cx88_set_tvnorm() to return without programming any
    registers (leaving the driver saying it's set to NTSC but the hardware
    isn't programmed).  Even worse, any subsequent attempt to explicitly
    set it to NTSC-M will return success but actually fail to program the
    underlying registers unless first changing the standard to something
    other than NTSC-M.
    
    Set the initial standard later in the process, and make sure the field
    is zero at the beginning to ensure that the call always goes through.
    
    This regression was introduced in the following commit:

    x86/xen: allow userspace access during hypercalls

    some for some hypercalls argument is a pointers to user-provided

    So, lets allow it.

    md: don't use flush_signals in userspace processes
    
    commit f9c79bc05a2a91f4fba8bfd653579e066714b1ec upstream.
    
    The function flush_signals clears all pending signals for the process. It
    may be used by kernel threads when we need to prepare a kernel thread for
    responding to signals. However using this function for an userspaces
    processes is incorrect - clearing signals without the program expecting it
    can cause misbehavior.
    
    The raid1 and raid5 code uses flush_signals in its request routine because
    it wants to prepare for an interruptible wait. This patch drops
    flush_signals and uses sigprocmask instead to block all signals (including
    SIGKILL) around the schedule() call. The signals are not lost, but the
    schedule() call won't respond to them.

    usb: renesas_usbhs: gadget: disable all eps when the driver stops
    
    commit b8b9c974afee685789fcbb191b52d1790be3608c upstream.
    
    A gadget driver will not disable eps immediately when ->disconnect()
    is called. But, since this driver assumes all eps stop after
    the ->disconnect(), unexpected behavior happens (especially in system
    suspend).
    So, this patch disables all eps in usbhsg_try_stop(). After disabling
    eps by renesas_usbhs driver, since some functions will be called by
    both a gadget and renesas_usbhs driver, renesas_usbhs driver should
    protect uep->pipe. To protect uep->pipe easily, this patch adds a new
    lock in struct usbhsg_uep.

    mxl111sf: Fix driver to use heap allocate buffers for USB messages
    
    commit d90b336f3f652ff0441e631a06236f785581c8f7 upstream.
    
    The recent changes in 4.9 to mandate USB buffers be heap allocated
    broke this driver, which was allocating the buffers on the stack.
    This resulted in the device failing at initialization.
    
    Introduce dedicated send/receive buffers as part of the state
    structure, and add a mutex to protect access to them.
    
    Note: we also had to tweak the API to mxl111sf_ctrl_msg to pass
    the pointer to the state struct rather than the device, since
    we need it inside the function to access the buffers and the
    mutex.  This patch adjusts the callers to match the API change.

    xhci: fix 20000ms port resume timeout
    
    commit a54408d0a004757789863d74e29c2297edae0b4d upstream.
    
    A uncleared PLC (port link change) bit will prevent furuther port event
    interrupts for that port. Leaving it uncleared caused get_port_status()
    to timeout after 20000ms while waiting to get the final port event
    interrupt for resume -> U0 state change.
    
    This is a targeted fix for a specific case where we get a port resume event
    racing with xhci resume. The port event interrupt handler notices xHC is
    not yet running and bails out early, leaving PLC uncleared.
    
    The whole xhci port resuming needs more attention, but while working on it
    it anyways makes sense to always ensure PLC is cleared in get_port_status
    before setting a new link state and waiting for its completion.

    ipvs: SNAT packet replies only for NATed connections
    
    commit 3c5ab3f395d66a9e4e937fcfdf6ebc63894f028b upstream.
    
    We do not check if packet from real server is for NAT
    connection before performing SNAT. This causes problems
    for setups that use DR/TUN and allow local clients to
    access the real server directly, for example:
    
    - local client in director creates IPVS-DR/TUN connection
    CIP->VIP and the request packets are routed to RIP.
    Talks are finished but IPVS connection is not expired yet.
    
    - second local client creates non-IPVS connection CIP->RIP
    with same reply tuple RIP->CIP and when replies are received
    on LOCAL_IN we wrongly assign them for the first client
    connection because RIP->CIP matches the reply direction.
    As result, IPVS SNATs replies for non-IPVS connections.
    
    The problem is more visible to local UDP clients but in rare
    cases it can happen also for TCP or remote clients when the
    real server sends the reply traffic via the director.
    
    So, better to be more precise for the reply traffic.
    As replies are not expected for DR/TUN connections, better
    to not touch them.

      do_IRQ: 31.151 No irq handler for vector
    
    According to above logs, there is an interrupt triggered and it is
    dispatched to CPU31 with a vector number 151, but there is no handler for
    it, thus this IRQ will not get acked and will cause an IRQ flood which
    kills the system.  To be more specific, the 31.151 is an interrupt from the
    AHCI host controller.
    
    After some investigation, the reason why this issue is triggered is because
    the thaw_noirq() function does not restore the MSI/MSI-X settings across
    hibernation.
    
    The scenario is illustrated below:
    
      1. Before hibernation, IRQ 34 is the handler for the AHCI device, which
         is bound to CPU31.
    
      2. Hibernation starts, the AHCI device is put into low power state.
    
      3. All the nonboot CPUs are put offline, so IRQ 34 has to be migrated to
         the last alive one - CPU0.
    
      4. After the snapshot has been created, all the nonboot CPUs are brought
         up again; IRQ 34 remains bound to CPU0.
    
      5. AHCI devices are put into D0.
    
      6. The snapshot is written to the disk.
    
    The issue is triggered in step 6.  The AHCI interrupt should be delivered
    to CPU0, however it is delivered to the original CPU31 instead, which
    causes the "No irq handler" issue.
    
    Ying Huang has provided a clue that, in step 3 it is possible that writing
    to the register might not take effect as the PCI devices have been
    suspended.
    
    In step 3, the IRQ 34 affinity should be modified from CPU31 to CPU0, but
    in fact it is not.  In __pci_write_msi_msg(), if the device is already in
    low power state, the low level MSI message entry will not be updated but
    cached.  During the device restore process after a normal suspend/resume,
    pci_restore_msi_state() writes the cached MSI back to the hardware.
    
    But this is not the case for hibernation.  pci_restore_msi_state() is not
    currently called in pci_pm_thaw_noirq(), although pci_save_state() has
    saved the necessary PCI cached information in pci_pm_freeze_noirq().
    
    Restore the PCI status for the device during hibernation.  Otherwise the
    status might be lost across hibernation (for example, settings for MSI,
    MSI-X, ATS, ACS, IOV, etc.), which might cause problems during hibernation.

    PCI: rockchip: Use normal register bank for config accessors
    
    commit dc8cca5ef25ac4cb0dfc37467521a759767ff361 upstream.
    
    Rockchip's RC has two banks of registers for the root port: a normal bank
    that is strictly compatible with the PCIe spec, and a privileged bank that
    can be used to change RO bits of root port registers.
    
    When probing the RC driver, we use the privileged bank to do some basic
    setup work as some RO bits are hw-inited to wrong value.  But we didn't
    change to the normal bank after probing the driver.
    
    This leads to a serious problem when the PME code tries to clear the PME
    status by writing PCI_EXP_RTSTA_PME to the register of PCI_EXP_RTSTA.  Per
    PCIe 3.0 spec, section 7.8.14, the PME status bit is RW1C.  So the PME code
    is doing the right thing to clear the PME status but we find the RC doesn't
    clear it but actually setting it to one.  So finally the system trap in
    pcie_pme_work_fn() as PCI_EXP_RTSTA_PME is true now forever.  This issue
    can be reproduced by booting kernel with pci=nomsi.
    
    Use the normal register bank for the PCI config accessors.  The privileged
    bank is used only internally by this driver.

    PCI: Work around poweroff & suspend-to-RAM issue on Macbook Pro 11
    
    commit 13cfc732160f7bc7e596128ce34cda361c556966 upstream.
    
    Neither soft poweroff (transition to ACPI power state S5) nor
    suspend-to-RAM (transition to state S3) works on the Macbook Pro 11,4 and
    11,5.
    
    The problem is related to the [mem 0x7fa00000-0x7fbfffff] space.  When we
    use that space, e.g., by assigning it to the 00:1c.0 Root Port, the ACPI
    Power Management 1 Control Register (PM1_CNT) at [io 0x1804] doesn't work
    anymore.
    
    Linux does a soft poweroff (transition to S5) by writing to PM1_CNT.  The
    theory about why this doesn't work is:
    
      - The write to PM1_CNT causes an SMI
      - The BIOS SMI handler depends on something in
        [mem 0x7fa00000-0x7fbfffff]
      - When Linux assigns [mem 0x7fa00000-0x7fbfffff] to the 00:1c.0 Port, it
        covers up whatever the SMI handler uses, so the SMI handler no longer
        works correctly
    
    Reserve the [mem 0x7fa00000-0x7fbfffff] space so we don't assign it to
    anything.
    
    This is voodoo programming, since we don't know what the real conflict is,
    but we've failed to find the root cause.

    af_key: Fix sadb_x_ipsecrequest parsing
    
    commit 096f41d3a8fcbb8dde7f71379b1ca85fe213eded upstream.
    
    The parsing of sadb_x_ipsecrequest is broken in a number of ways.
    First of all we're not verifying sadb_x_ipsecrequest_len.  This
    is needed when the structure carries addresses at the end.  Worse
    we don't even look at the length when we parse those optional
    addresses.
    
    The migration code had similar parsing code that's better but
    it also has some deficiencies.  The length is overcounted first
    of all as it includes the header itself.  It also fails to check
    the length before dereferencing the sa_family field.
    
    This patch fixes those problems in parse_sockaddr_pair and then
    uses it in parse_ipsecrequest.

    commit 2400fd822f467cb4c886c879d8ad99feac9cf319 upstream.
    
    The workaround for the CELL timebase bug does not correctly mark cr0 as
    being clobbered. This means GCC doesn't know that the asm block changes cr0 and
    might leave the result of an unrelated comparison in cr0 across the block, which
    we then trash, leading to basically random behaviour.

    commit 64e756c55aa46fc18fd53e8f3598b73b528d8637 upstream.
    
    From POWER4 onwards, mfocrf() only places the specified CR field into

    from version 3.0 now requires this behaviour.

    powerpc/64: Fix atomic64_inc_not_zero() to return an int
    
    commit 01e6a61aceb82e13bec29502a8eb70d9574f97ad upstream.
    
    Although it's not documented anywhere, there is an expectation that
    atomic64_inc_not_zero() returns a result which fits in an int. This is
    the behaviour implemented on all arches except powerpc.
    
    This has caused at least one bug in practice, in the percpu-refcount
    code, where the long result from our atomic64_inc_not_zero() was
    truncated to an int leading to lost references and stuck systems. That
    was worked around in that code in commit 966d2b04e070 ("percpu-refcount:
    fix reference leak during percpu-atomic transition").
    
    To the best of my grepping abilities there are no other callers
    in-tree which truncate the value, but we should fix it anyway. Because
    the breakage is subtle and potentially very harmful I'm also tagging
    it for stable.
    
    Code generation is largely unaffected because in most cases the
    callers are just using the result for a test anyway. In particular the
    case of fget() that was mentioned in commit a6cf7ed5119f
    ("powerpc/atomic: Implement atomic*_inc_not_zero") generates exactly
    the same code.

    powerpc/pseries: Fix passing of pp0 in updatepp() and updateboltedpp()
    
    commit e71ff982ae4c17d176e9f0132157d54973788377 upstream.
    
    Once upon a time there were only two PP (page protection) bits. In ISA
    2.03 an additional PP bit was added, but because of the layout of the
    HPTE it could not be made contiguous with the existing PP bits.
    
    The result is that we now have three PP bits, named pp0, pp1, pp2,
    where pp0 occupies bit 63 of dword 1 of the HPTE and pp1 and pp2
    occupy bits 1 and 0 respectively. Until recently Linux hasn't used
    pp0, however with the addition of _PAGE_KERNEL_RO we started using it.
    
    The problem arises in the LPAR code, where we need to translate the PP
    bits into the argument for the H_PROTECT hypercall. Currently the code
    only passes bits 0-2 of newpp, which covers pp1, pp2 and N (no
    execute), meaning pp0 is not passed to the hypervisor at all.
    
    We can't simply pass it through in bit 63, as that would collide with a
    different field in the flags argument, as defined in PAPR. Instead we
    have to shift it down to bit 8 (IBM bit 55).

          iscsi-target: Drop work-around for legacy GlobalSAN initiator
    
    Namely, the workaround for FirstBurstLength ended up being required by
    Mellanox Flexboot PXE boot ROMs as reported by Robert.
    
    So this patch re-adds the work-around for FirstBurstLength within
    iscsi_check_proposer_for_optional_reply(), and makes the key optional
    to respond when the initiator does not propose, nor respond to it.
    
    Also as requested by Arun, this patch introduces a new TPG attribute
    named 'login_keys_workaround' that controls the use of both the
    FirstBurstLength workaround, as well as the two other existing
    workarounds for gPXE iSCSI boot client.
    
    By default, the workaround is enabled with login_keys_workaround=1,
    since Mellanox FlexBoot requires it, and Arun has verified the Qlogic
    MSFT initiator already proposes FirstBurstLength, so it's uneffected
    by this re-adding this part of the original work-around.

    scsi: Add STARGET_CREATED_REMOVE state to scsi_target_state
    
    commit f9279c968c257ee39b0d7bd2571a4d231a67bcc1 upstream.
    
    The addition of the STARGET_REMOVE state had the side effect of
    introducing a race condition that can cause a crash.
    
    scsi_target_reap_ref_release() checks the starget->state to
    see if it still in STARGET_CREATED, and if so, skips calling
    transport_remove_device() and device_del(), because the starget->state
    is only set to STARGET_RUNNING after scsi_target_add() has called
    device_add() and transport_add_device().
    
    However, if an rport loss occurs while a target is being scanned,
    it can happen that scsi_remove_target() will be called while the
    starget is still in the STARGET_CREATED state.  In this case, the
    starget->state will be set to STARGET_REMOVE, and as a result,
    scsi_target_reap_ref_release() will take the wrong path.  The end
    result is a panic:

    igb: Explicitly select page 0 at initialization
    
    commit 440aeca4b9858248d8f16d724d9fa87a4f65fa33 upstream.
    
    The functions igb_read_phy_reg_gs40g/igb_write_phy_reg_gs40g (which were
    removed in 2a3cdea) explicitly selected the required page at every phy_reg
    access. Currently, igb_get_phy_id_82575 relays on the fact that page 0 is
    already selected. The assumption is not fulfilled for my Lex 3I380CW
    motherboard with integrated dual i211 based gigabit ethernet. This leads to igb
    initialization failure and network interfaces are not working:

    btrfs: Don't clear SGID when inheriting ACLs
    
    commit b7f8a09f8097db776b8d160862540e4fc1f51296 upstream.
    
    When new directory 'DIR1' is created in a directory 'DIR0' with SGID bit
    set, DIR1 is expected to have SGID bit set (and owning group equal to
    the owning group of 'DIR0'). However when 'DIR0' also has some default
    ACLs that 'DIR1' inherits, setting these ACLs will result in SGID bit on
    'DIR1' to get cleared if user is not member of the owning group.
    
    Fix the problem by moving posix_acl_update_mode() out of
    __btrfs_set_acl() into btrfs_set_acl(). That way the function will not be
    called when inheriting ACLs which is what we want as it prevents SGID
    bit clearing and the mode has been properly set by posix_acl_create()
    anyway.

    wlcore: fix 64K page support
    
    commit 4a4274bf2dbbd1c7a45be0c89a1687c9d2eef4a0 upstream.
    
    In the stable linux-3.16 branch, I ran into a warning in the
    wlcore driver:
    
    drivers/net/wireless/ti/wlcore/spi.c: In function 'wl12xx_spi_raw_write':
    drivers/net/wireless/ti/wlcore/spi.c:315:1: error: the frame size of 12848 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
    
    Newer kernels no longer show the warning, but the bug is still there,
    as the allocation is based on the CPU page size rather than the
    actual capabilities of the hardware.
    
    This replaces the PAGE_SIZE macro with the SZ_4K macro, i.e. 4096 bytes
    per buffer.

    commit 6a558f12dbe85437acbdec5e149ea07b5554eced upstream.
    
    Sometimes a FUP packet is associated with a TSX transaction and a flag is
    set to indicate that. Ensure that flag is cleared on any error condition
    because at that point the decoder can no longer assume it is correct.

    commit 622b7a47b843c78626f40c1d1aeef8483383fba2 upstream.
    
    The decoder will try to use branch packets to find an IP to start decoding
    or to recover from errors. Currently the FUP packet is used only in the
    case of an overflow, however there is no reason for that to be a special
    case. So just use FUP always when scanning for an IP.

    commit f952eaceb089b691eba7c4e13686e742a8f26bf5 upstream.
    
    Intel PT uses IP compression based on the last IP. For decoding purposes,
    'last IP' is not updated when a branch target has been suppressed, which is
    indicated by IPBytes == 0. IPBytes is stored in the packet 'count', so

    perf intel-pt: Fix last_ip usage
    
    commit ee14ac0ef6827cd6f9a572cc83dd0191ea17812c upstream.
    
    Intel PT uses IP compression based on the last IP. For decoding
    purposes, 'last IP' is considered to be reset to zero whenever there is
    a synchronization packet (PSB). The decoder wasn't doing that, and was
    treating the zero value to mean that there was no last IP, whereas
    compression can be done against the zero value. Fix by setting last_ip
    to zero when a PSB is received and keep track of have_last_ip.

    commit 3f04d98e972b59706bd43d6cc75efac91f8fba50 upstream.
    
    The decoder uses its current timestamp in samples. Usually that is a
    timestamp that has already passed, but in some cases it is a timestamp
    for a branch that the decoder is walking towards, and consequently
    hasn't reached. Improve that situation by using the pkt_state to
    determine when to use the current or previous timestamp.

    NFC: Add sockaddr length checks before accessing sa_family in bind handlers
    
    commit f6a5885fc4d68e7f25ffb42b9d8d80aebb3bacbb upstream.
    
    Verify that the caller-provided sockaddr structure is large enough to
    contain the sa_family field, before accessing it in bind() handlers of the
    AF_NFC socket. Since the syscall doesn't enforce a minimum size of the
    corresponding memory region, very short sockaddrs (zero or one byte long)
    result in operating on uninitialized memory while referencing .sa_family.

    nfc: Fix the sockaddr length sanitization in llcp_sock_connect
    
    commit 608c4adfcabab220142ee335a2a003ccd1c0b25b upstream.
    
    Fix the sockaddr length verification in the connect() handler of NFC/LLCP
    sockets, to compare against the size of the actual structure expected on
    input (sockaddr_nfc_llcp) instead of its shorter version (sockaddr_nfc).
    
    Both structures are defined in include/uapi/linux/nfc.h. The fields
    specific to the _llcp extended struct are as follows:
    
       276          __u8 dsap; /* Destination SAP, if known */
       277          __u8 ssap; /* Source SAP to be bound to */
       278          char service_name[NFC_LLCP_MAX_SERVICE_NAME]; /* Service name URI */;
       279          size_t service_name_len;
    
    If the caller doesn't provide a sufficiently long sockaddr buffer, these
    fields remain uninitialized (and they currently originate from the stack
    frame of the top-level sys_connect handler). They are then copied by
    llcp_sock_connect() into internal storage (nfc_llcp_sock structure), and
    could be subsequently read back through the user-mode getsockname()
    function (handled by llcp_sock_getname()). This would result in the
    disclosure of up to ~70 uninitialized bytes from the kernel stack to
    user-mode clients capable of creating AFC_NFC sockets.

    commit a0323b979f81ad2deb2c8836eab506534891876a upstream.
    
    Check that the NFC_ATTR_TARGET_INDEX and NFC_ATTR_PROTOCOLS attributes (in
    addition to NFC_ATTR_DEVICE_INDEX) are provided by the netlink client
    prior to accessing them. This prevents potential unhandled NULL pointer

    NFC: nfcmrvl: fix firmware-management initialisation
    
    commit 45dd39b974f6632222dd5cdcbea7358a077ab0b0 upstream.
    
    The nci-device was never deregistered in the event that
    fw-initialisation failed.
    
    Fix this by moving the firmware initialisation before device
    registration since the firmware work queue should be available before
    registering.
    
    Note that this depends on a recent fix that moved device-name
    initialisation back to to nci_allocate_device() as the
    firmware-workqueue name is now derived from the nfc-device name.

    commit e5834ac22948169bbd7c45996d8d4905edd20f5e upstream.
    
    Use the nfc- rather than phy-device in firmware-management code that
    needs a valid struct device.
    
    This specifically fixes a NULL-pointer dereference in
    nfcmrvl_fw_dnld_init() during registration when the underlying tty is
    one end of a Unix98 pty.
    
    Note that the driver still uses the phy device for any debugging, which
    is fine for now.

    NFC: nfcmrvl: do not use device-managed resources
    
    commit 0cbe40112f42cf5e008f9127f6cd5952ba3946c7 upstream.
    
    This specifically fixes resource leaks in the registration error paths.
    
    Device-managed resources is a bad fit for this driver as devices can be
    registered from the n_nci line discipline. Firstly, a tty may not even
    have a corresponding device (should it be part of a Unix98 pty)
    something which would lead to a NULL-pointer dereference when
    registering resources.
    
    Secondly, if the tty has a class device, its lifetime exceeds that of
    the line discipline, which means that resources would leak every time
    the line discipline is closed (or if registration fails).
    
    Currently, the devres interface was only being used to request a reset
    gpio despite the fact that it was already explicitly freed in
    nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev() (along with the private data), something
    which also prevented the resource leak at close.
    
    Note that the driver treats gpio number 0 as invalid despite it being
    perfectly valid. This will be addressed in a follow-up patch.

    NFC: fix broken device allocation
    
    commit 20777bc57c346b6994f465e0d8261a7fbf213a09 upstream.
    
    Commit 7eda8b8e9677 ("NFC: Use IDR library to assing NFC devices IDs")
    moved device-id allocation and struct-device initialisation from
    nfc_allocate_device() to nfc_register_device().
    
    This broke just about every nfc-device-registration error path, which
    continue to call nfc_free_device() that tries to put the device
    reference of the now uninitialised (but zeroed) struct device:
    
    kobject: '(null)' (ce316420): is not initialized, yet kobject_put() is being called.
    
    The late struct-device initialisation also meant that various work
    queues whose names are derived from the nfc device name were also
    misnamed:
    
      421 root         0 SW<  [(null)_nci_cmd_]
      422 root         0 SW<  [(null)_nci_rx_w]
      423 root         0 SW<  [(null)_nci_tx_w]
    
    Move the id-allocation and struct-device initialisation back to
    nfc_allocate_device() and fix up the single call site which did not use
    nfc_free_device() in its error path.

    ath9k: fix an invalid pointer dereference in ath9k_rng_stop()
    
    commit 07246c115801c27652700e3679bb58661ef7ed65 upstream.
    
    The bug was triggered when do suspend/resuming continuously
    on Dell XPS L322X/0PJHXN version 9333 (2013) with kernel
    4.12.0-041200rc4-generic. But can't reproduce on DELL
    E5440 + AR9300 PCIE chips.
    
    The warning is caused by accessing invalid pointer sc->rng_task.
    sc->rng_task is not be cleared after kthread_stop(sc->rng_task)
    be called in ath9k_rng_stop(). Because the kthread is stopped
    before ath9k_rng_kthread() be scheduled.
    
    So set sc->rng_task to null after kthread_stop(sc->rng_task) to
    resolve this issue.

    ath9k: fix tx99 use after free
    
    commit cf8ce1ea61b75712a154c93e40f2a5af2e4dd997 upstream.
    
    One scenario that could lead to UAF is two threads writing
    simultaneously to the "tx99" debug file. One of them would
    set the "start" value to true and follow to ath9k_tx99_init().
    Inside the function it would set the sc->tx99_state to true
    after allocating sc->tx99skb. Then, the other thread would
    execute write_file_tx99() and call ath9k_tx99_deinit().
    sc->tx99_state would be freed. After that, the first thread
    would continue inside ath9k_tx99_init() and call
    r = ath9k_tx99_send(sc, sc->tx99_skb, &txctl);
    that would make use of the freed sc->tx99_skb memory.

    thermal: max77620: fix device-node reference imbalance
    
    commit c592fafbdbb6b1279b76a54722d1465ca77e5bde upstream.
    
    The thermal child device reuses the parent MFD-device device-tree node
    when registering a thermal zone, but did not take a reference to the
    node.
    
    This leads to a reference imbalance, and potential use-after-free, when
    the node reference is dropped by the platform-bus device destructor
    (once for the child and later again for the parent).
    
    Fix this by dropping any reference already held to a device-tree node
    and getting a reference to the parent's node which will be balanced on
    reprobe or on platform-device release, whichever comes first.
    
    Note that simply clearing the of_node pointer on probe errors and on
    driver unbind would not allow the use of device-managed resources as
    specifically thermal_zone_of_sensor_unregister() claims that a valid
    device-tree node pointer is needed during deregistration (even if it
    currently does not seem to use it).

    disable new gcc-7.1.1 warnings for now
    
    commit bd664f6b3e376a8ef4990f87d08271cc2d01ba9a upstream.
    
    I made the mistake of upgrading my desktop to the new Fedora 26 that
    comes with gcc-7.1.1.
    
    There's nothing wrong per se that I've noticed, but I now have 1500
    lines of warnings, mostly from the new format-truncation warning
    triggering all over the tree.
    
    We use 'snprintf()' and friends in a lot of places, and often know that
    the numbers are fairly small (ie a controller index or similar), but gcc
    doesn't know that, and sees an 'int', and thinks that it could be some
    huge number.  And then complains when our buffers are not able to fit
    the name for the ten millionth controller.
    
    These warnings aren't necessarily bad per se, and we probably want to
    look through them subsystem by subsystem, but at least during the merge
    window they just mean that I can't even see if somebody is introducing
    any *real* problems when I pull.
    
    So warnings disabled for now.
