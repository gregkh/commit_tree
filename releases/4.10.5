    crypto: s5p-sss - Fix spinlock recursion on LRW(AES)
    
    commit 28b62b1458685d8f68f67d9b2d511bf8fa32b746 upstream.
    
    Running TCRYPT with LRW compiled causes spinlock recursion:

    Interrupt handling routine was calling req->base.complete() under
    spinlock.  In most cases this wasn't fatal but when combined with some
    of the cipher modes (like LRW) this caused recursion - starting the new
    encryption (s5p_aes_crypt()) while still holding the spinlock from
    previous round (s5p_aes_complete()).
    
    Beside that, the s5p_aes_interrupt() error handling path could execute
    two completions in case of error for RX and TX blocks.
    
    Rewrite the interrupt handling routine and the completion by:
    
    1. Splitting the operations on scatterlist copies from
       s5p_aes_complete() into separate s5p_sg_done(). This still should be
       done under lock.
       The s5p_aes_complete() now only calls req->base.complete() and it has
       to be called outside of lock.
    
    2. Moving the s5p_aes_complete() out of spinlock critical sections.
       In interrupt service routine s5p_aes_interrupts(), it appeared in few
       places, including error paths inside other functions called from ISR.
       This code was not so obvious to read so simplify it by putting the
       s5p_aes_complete() only within ISR level.

    crypto: powerpc - Fix initialisation of crc32c context
    
    commit aa2be9b3d6d2d699e9ca7cbfc00867c80e5da213 upstream.
    
    Turning on crypto self-tests on a POWER8 shows:
    
        alg: hash: Test 1 failed for crc32c-vpmsum
        00000000: ff ff ff ff
    
    Comparing the code with the Intel CRC32c implementation on which
    ours is based shows that we are doing an init with 0, not ~0
    as CRC32c requires.
    
    This probably wasn't caught because btrfs does its own weird
    open-coded initialisation.
    
    Initialise our internal context to ~0 on init.
    
    This makes the self-tests pass, and btrfs continues to work.

    futex: Fix potential use-after-free in FUTEX_REQUEUE_PI
    
    commit c236c8e95a3d395b0494e7108f0d41cf36ec107c upstream.
    
    While working on the futex code, I stumbled over this potential
    use-after-free scenario. Dmitry triggered it later with syzkaller.
    
    pi_mutex is a pointer into pi_state, which we drop the reference on in
    unqueue_me_pi(). So any access to that pointer after that is bad.
    
    Since other sites already do rt_mutex_unlock() with hb->lock held, see
    for example futex_lock_pi(), simply move the unlock before
    unqueue_me_pi().

    If one thread mmaps a perf event while another thread in the same mm
    is in some context where active_mm != mm (which can happen in the

    x86/intel_rdt: Put group node in rdtgroup_kn_unlock
    
    commit 49ec8f5b6ae3ab60385492cad900ffc8a523c895 upstream.
    
    The rdtgroup_kn_unlock waits for the last user to release and put its
    node. But it's calling kernfs_put on the node which calls the
    rdtgroup_kn_unlock, which might not be the group's directory node, but
    another group's file node.
    
    This race could be easily reproduced by running 2 instances
    of following script:
    
      mount -t resctrl resctrl /sys/fs/resctrl/
      pushd /sys/fs/resctrl/
      mkdir krava
      echo "krava" > krava/schemata
      rmdir krava
      popd
      umount  /sys/fs/resctrl
    
    It triggers the slub debug error message with following command
    line config: slub_debug=,kernfs_node_cache.
    
    Call kernfs_put on the group's node to fix it.

    The kernel doesn't boot with both PROFILE_ANNOTATED_BRANCHES=y and KASAN=y
    options selected. With branch profiling enabled we end up calling
    ftrace_likely_update() before kasan_early_init(). ftrace_likely_update() is
    built with KASAN instrumentation, so calling it before kasan has been
    initialized leads to crash.
    
    Use DISABLE_BRANCH_PROFILING define to make sure that we don't call
    ftrace_likely_update() from early code before kasan_early_init().

    x86/tsc: Fix ART for TSC_KNOWN_FREQ
    
    commit 44fee88cea43d3c2cac962e0439cb10a3cabff6d upstream.
    
    Subhransu reported that convert_art_to_tsc() isn't working for him.
    
    The ART to TSC relation is only set up for systems which use the refined
    TSC calibration. Systems with known TSC frequency (available via CPUID 15)
    are not using the refined calibration and therefor the ART to TSC relation
    is never established.
    
    Add the setup to the known frequency init path which skips ART
    calibration. The init code needs to be duplicated as for systems which use
    refined calibration the ART setup must be delayed until calibration has
    been done.
    
    The problem has been there since the ART support was introdduced, but only
    detected now because Subhransu tested the first time on hardware which has
    TSC frequency enumerated via CPUID 15.
    
    Note for stable: The conditional has changed from TSC_RELIABLE to
                     TSC_KNOWN_FREQUENCY.

    x86/unwind: Fix last frame check for aligned function stacks
    
    commit 87a6b2975f0d340c75b7488d22d61d2f98fb8abf upstream.
    
    Pavel Machek reported the following warning on x86-32:
    
      WARNING: kernel stack frame pointer at f50cdf98 in swapper/2:0 has bad value   (null)
    
    The warning is caused by the unwinder not realizing that it reached the
    end of the stack, due to an unusual prologue which gcc sometimes
    generates for aligned stacks.  The prologue is based on a gcc feature
    called the Dynamic Realign Argument Pointer (DRAP).  It's almost always
    enabled for aligned stacks when -maccumulate-outgoing-args isn't set.
    
    This issue is similar to the one fixed by the following commit:
    
      8023e0e2a48d ("x86/unwind: Adjust last frame check for aligned function stacks")
    
    ... but that fix was specific to x86-64.
    
    Make the fix more generic to cover x86-32 as well, and also ensure that
    the return address referred to by the frame pointer is a copy of the
    original return address.

    commit 4b84b4a5507913ee0da27b1f1b27671937839de6 upstream.
    
    During system resume time initialization the HPD level on LSPCON ports
    can stay low for an extended amount of time, leading to failed AUX
    transfers and LSPCON initialization. Fix this by waiting for HPD to get

    drm/i915/gen9+: Enable hotplug detection early
    
    commit 2a57d9cce1c08578097d965468e37f06d71fa495 upstream.
    
    For LSPCON resume time initialization we need to sample the
    corresponding pin's HPD level, but this is only available when HPD
    detection is enabled. Currently we enable detection only when enabling
    HPD interrupts which is too late, so bring the enabling of detection
    earlier.
    
    This is needed by the next patch.

    drm/i915/lspcon: Enable AUX interrupts for resume time initialization
    
    commit 908764f6d0bd1ba496cb8da33b9b98297ed27351 upstream.
    
    For LSPCON initialization during system resume we need AUX
    functionality, but we call the corresponding encoder reset hook with all
    interrupts disabled. Without interrupts we'll do a poll-wait for AUX
    transfer completions, which adds a significant delay if the transfers
    timeout/need to be retried for some reason.
    
    Fix this by enabling interrupts before calling the reset hooks. Note
    that while this will enable AUX interrupts it will keep HPD interrupts
    disabled, in a similar way to the init time output setup code.
    
    This issue existed since LSPCON support was added.
    
    v2:
    - Rebased on drm-tip.

    irqchip/gicv3-its: Add workaround for QDF2400 ITS erratum 0065
    
    commit 90922a2d03d84de36bf8a9979d62580102f31a92 upstream.
    
    On Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies QDF2400 SoCs, the ITS hardware
    implementation uses 16Bytes for Interrupt Translation Entry (ITE),
    but reports an incorrect value of 8Bytes in GITS_TYPER.ITTE_size.
    
    It might cause kernel memory corruption depending on the number
    of MSI(x) that are configured and the amount of memory that has
    been allocated for ITEs in its_create_device().
    
    This patch fixes the potential memory corruption by setting the
    correct ITE size to 16Bytes.

    arm64: KVM: VHE: Clear HCR_TGE when invalidating guest TLBs
    
    commit 68925176296a8b995e503349200e256674bfe5ac upstream.
    
    When invalidating guest TLBs, special care must be taken to
    actually shoot the guest TLBs and not the host ones if we're
    running on a VHE system.  This is controlled by the HCR_EL2.TGE
    bit, which we forget to clear before invalidating TLBs.
    
    Address the issue by introducing two wrappers (__tlb_switch_to_guest
    and __tlb_switch_to_host) that take care of both the VTTBR_EL2
    and HCR_EL2.TGE switching.

    tun: fix premature POLLOUT notification on tun devices
    
    [ Upstream commit b20e2d54789c6acbf6bd0efdbec2cf5fa4d90ef1 ]
    
    aszlig observed failing ssh tunnels (-w) during initialization since
    commit cc9da6cc4f56e0 ("ipv6: addrconf: use stable address generator for
    ARPHRD_NONE"). We already had reports that the mentioned commit breaks
    Juniper VPN connections. I can't clearly say that the Juniper VPN client
    has the same problem, but it is worth a try to hint to this patch.
    
    Because of the early generation of link local addresses, the kernel now
    can start asking for routers on the local subnet much earlier than usual.
    Those router solicitation packets arrive inside the ssh channels and
    should be transmitted to the tun fd before the configuration scripts
    might have upped the interface and made it ready for transmission.
    
    ssh polls on the interface and receives back a POLL_OUT. It tries to send
    the earily router solicitation packet to the tun interface.  Unfortunately
    it hasn't been up'ed yet by config scripts, thus failing with -EIO. ssh
    doesn't retry again and considers the tun interface broken forever.

    dccp/tcp: fix routing redirect race
    
    [ Upstream commit 45caeaa5ac0b4b11784ac6f932c0ad4c6b67cda0 ]
    
    As Eric Dumazet pointed out this also needs to be fixed in IPv6.
    v2: Contains the IPv6 tcp/Ipv6 dccp patches as well.
    
    We have seen a few incidents lately where a dst_enty has been freed
    with a dangling TCP socket reference (sk->sk_dst_cache) pointing to that
    dst_entry. If the conditions/timings are right a crash then ensues when the
    freed dst_entry is referenced later on. A Common crashing back trace is:
    
     #8 [] page_fault at ffffffff8163e648
        [exception RIP: __tcp_ack_snd_check+74]
    .
    .

    #25 [] irq_exit at ffffffff81084ee5
    #26 [] do_IRQ at ffffffff81648ff8
    
    Of course it may happen with other NIC drivers as well.
    
    It's found the freed dst_entry here:
    
     224 static bool tcp_in_quickack_mode(struct sock *sk)↩
     225 {↩
     226 ▹       const struct inet_connection_sock *icsk = inet_csk(sk);↩
     227 ▹       const struct dst_entry *dst = __sk_dst_get(sk);↩
     228 ↩
     229 ▹       return (dst && dst_metric(dst, RTAX_QUICKACK)) ||↩
     230 ▹       ▹       (icsk->icsk_ack.quick && !icsk->icsk_ack.pingpong);↩
     231 }↩
    
    But there are other backtraces attributed to the same freed dst_entry in
    netfilter code as well.
    
    All the vmcores showed 2 significant clues:
    
    - Remote hosts behind the default gateway had always been redirected to a
    different gateway. A rtable/dst_entry will be added for that host. Making
    more dst_entrys with lower reference counts. Making this more probable.
    
    - All vmcores showed a postitive LockDroppedIcmps value, e.g:
    
    LockDroppedIcmps                  267
    
    A closer look at the tcp_v4_err() handler revealed that do_redirect() will run
    regardless of whether user space has the socket locked. This can result in a
    race condition where the same dst_entry cached in sk->sk_dst_entry can be
    decremented twice for the same socket via:
    
    do_redirect()->__sk_dst_check()-> dst_release().
    
    Which leads to the dst_entry being prematurely freed with another socket
    pointing to it via sk->sk_dst_cache and a subsequent crash.
    
    To fix this skip do_redirect() if usespace has the socket locked. Instead let
    the redirect take place later when user space does not have the socket
    locked.
    
    The dccp/IPv6 code is very similar in this respect, so fixing it there too.
    
    As Eric Garver pointed out the following commit now invalidates routes. Which
    can set the dst->obsolete flag so that ipv4_dst_check() returns null and
    triggers the dst_release().

    [ Upstream commit 91864f5852f9996210fad400cf70fb85af091243 ]
    
    The previous idea was to check whether a net namespace is in
    net_exit_list or not. It doesn't work, because net->exit_list is used in
    __register_pernet_operations and __unregister_pernet_operations where
    all namespaces are added to a temporary list to make cleanup in a error
    case, so list_empty(&net->exit_list) always returns false.

    bridge: drop netfilter fake rtable unconditionally
    
    [ Upstream commit a13b2082ece95247779b9995c4e91b4246bed023 ]
    
    Andreas reports kernel oops during rmmod of the br_netfilter module.
    Hannes debugged the oops down to a NULL rt6info->rt6i_indev.
    
    Problem is that br_netfilter has the nasty concept of adding a fake
    rtable to skb->dst; this happens in a br_netfilter prerouting hook.
    
    A second hook (in bridge LOCAL_IN) is supposed to remove these again
    before the skb is handed up the stack.
    
    However, on module unload hooks get unregistered which means an
    skb could traverse the prerouting hook that attaches the fake_rtable,
    while the 'fake rtable remove' hook gets removed from the hooklist
    immediately after.

    ipv6: avoid write to a possibly cloned skb
    
    [ Upstream commit 79e49503efe53a8c51d8b695bedc8a346c5e4a87 ]
    
    ip6_fragment, in case skb has a fraglist, checks if the
    skb is cloned.  If it is, it will move to the 'slow path' and allocates
    new skbs for each fragment.
    
    However, right before entering the slowpath loop, it updates the
    nexthdr value of the last ipv6 extension header to NEXTHDR_FRAGMENT,
    to account for the fragment header that will be inserted in the new
    ipv6-fragment skbs.
    
    In case original skb is cloned this munges nexthdr value of another
    skb.  Avoid this by doing the nexthdr update for each of the new fragment
    skbs separately.
    
    This was observed with tcpdump on a bridge device where netfilter ipv6
    reassembly is active:  tcpdump shows malformed fragment headers as
    the l4 header (icmpv6, tcp, etc). is decoded as a fragment header.

    ipv6: make ECMP route replacement less greedy
    
    [ Upstream commit 67e194007be08d071294456274dd53e0a04fdf90 ]
    
    Commit 27596472473a ("ipv6: fix ECMP route replacement") introduced a
    loop that removes all siblings of an ECMP route that is being
    replaced. However, this loop doesn't stop when it has replaced
    siblings, and keeps removing other routes with a higher metric.
    We also end up triggering the WARN_ON after the loop, because after
    this nsiblings < 0.
    
    Instead, stop the loop when we have taken care of all routes with the
    same metric as the route being replaced.

    mpls: Do not decrement alive counter for unregister events
    
    [ Upstream commit 79099aab38c8f5c746748b066ae74ba984fe2cc8 ]
    
    Multipath routes can be rendered usesless when a device in one of the
    paths is deleted. For example:
    
    $ ip -f mpls ro ls
    100
            nexthop as to 200 via inet 172.16.2.2  dev virt12
            nexthop as to 300 via inet 172.16.3.2  dev br0
    101
            nexthop as to 201 via inet6 2000:2::2  dev virt12
            nexthop as to 301 via inet6 2000:3::2  dev br0
    
    $ ip li del br0
    
    When br0 is deleted the other hop is not considered in
    mpls_select_multipath because of the alive check -- rt_nhn_alive
    is 0.
    
    rt_nhn_alive is decremented once in mpls_ifdown when the device is taken
    down (NETDEV_DOWN) and again when it is deleted (NETDEV_UNREGISTER). For
    a 2 hop route, deleting one device drops the alive count to 0. Since
    devices are taken down before unregistering, the decrement on

    mpls: Send route delete notifications when router module is unloaded
    
    [ Upstream commit e37791ec1ad785b59022ae211f63a16189bacebf ]
    
    When the mpls_router module is unloaded, mpls routes are deleted but
    notifications are not sent to userspace leaving userspace caches
    out of sync. Add the call to mpls_notify_route in mpls_net_exit as
    routes are freed.

    amd-xgbe: Enable IRQs only if napi_complete_done() is true
    
    [ Upstream commit d7aba644ffdebf756e51e26a2229055211838e89 ]
    
    Depending on the hardware, the amd-xgbe driver may use disable_irq_nosync()
    and enable_irq() when an interrupt is received to process Rx packets. If
    the napi_complete_done() return value isn't checked an unbalanced enable
    for the IRQ could result, generating a warning stack trace.
    
    Update the driver to only enable interrupts if napi_complete_done() returns
    true.

    uapi: fix linux/packet_diag.h userspace compilation error

    Replace MAX_ADDR_LEN with its numeric value to fix the following

      __u8 pdmc_addr[MAX_ADDR_LEN];
    
    This is not the first case in the UAPI where the numeric value
    of MAX_ADDR_LEN is used instead of symbolic one, uapi/linux/if_link.h
    already does the same:
    
    $ grep MAX_ADDR_LEN include/uapi/linux/if_link.h
            __u8 mac[32]; /* MAX_ADDR_LEN */
    
    There are no UAPI headers besides these two that use MAX_ADDR_LEN.

    net/tunnel: set inner protocol in network gro hooks
    
    [ Upstream commit 294acf1c01bace5cea5d30b510504238bf5f7c25 ]
    
    The gso code of several tunnels type (gre and udp tunnels)
    takes for granted that the skb->inner_protocol is properly
    initialized and drops the packet elsewhere.
    
    On the forwarding path no one is initializing such field,
    so gro encapsulated packets are dropped on forward.
    
    Since commit 38720352412a ("gre: Use inner_proto to obtain
    inner header protocol"), this can be reproduced when the
    encapsulated packets use gre as the tunneling protocol.
    
    The issue happens also with vxlan and geneve tunnels since
    commit 8bce6d7d0d1e ("udp: Generalize skb_udp_segment"), if the
    forwarding host's ingress nic has h/w offload for such tunnel
    and a vxlan/geneve device is configured on top of it, regardless
    of the configured peer address and vni.
    
    To address the issue, this change initialize the inner_protocol
    field for encapsulated packets in both ipv4 and ipv6 gro complete
    callbacks.

    team: use ETH_MAX_MTU as max mtu
    
    [ Upstream commit 3331aa378e9bcbd0d16de9034b0c20f4050e26b4 ]
    
    This restores the ability to set a team device's mtu to anything higher
    than 1500. Similar to the reported issue with bonding, the team driver
    calls ether_setup(), which sets an initial max_mtu of 1500, while the
    underlying hardware can handle something much larger. Just set it to
    ETH_MAX_MTU to support all possible values, and the limitations of the
    underlying devices will prevent setting anything too large.

    Problem here is that when I got rid of listener spinlock, I missed the

    while TCP does not.
    
    Since multiple cpus could access it at the same time, we need to add

    sk_wmem_alloc and lead to leaks or use after free.

    [ Upstream commit 02b2faaf0af1d85585f6d6980e286d53612acfc2 ]
    
    Dmitry Vyukov reported a divide by 0 triggered by syzkaller, exploiting
    tcp_disconnect() path that was never really considered and/or used
    before syzkaller ;)
    
    I was not able to reproduce the bug, but it seems issues here are the
    three possible actions that assumed they would never trigger on a
    listener.
    
    1) tcp_write_timer_handler
    2) tcp_delack_timer_handler
    3) MTU reduction

     states from tcp_v6_mtu_reduced()

    [ Upstream commit 402168b4c2dc0734b8fbd282eff77da0275c5129 ]
    
    Some configurations require the use of the hardware's MDIO support to
    communicate with external PHYs. The MDIO commands indicate completion
    through the device interrupt. When bringing down the device the interrupts
    were released before stopping the external PHY, resulting in MDIO command
    timeouts. Move the stopping of the PHY to before the releasing of the
    interrupts.

    dccp: Unlock sock before calling sk_free()
    
    [ Upstream commit d5afb6f9b6bb2c57bd0c05e76e12489dc0d037d9 ]
    
    The code where sk_clone() came from created a new socket and locked it,
    but then, on the error path didn't unlock it.
    
    This problem stayed there for a long while, till b0691c8ee7c2 ("net:
    Unlock sock before calling sk_free()") fixed it, but unfortunately the
    callers of sk_clone() (now sk_clone_locked()) were not audited and the
    one in dccp_create_openreq_child() remained.
    
    Now in the age of the syskaller fuzzer, this was finally uncovered, as
    reported by Dmitry:
    
     ---- 8< ----
    
    I've got the following report while running syzkaller fuzzer on

    ipv6: orphan skbs in reassembly unit
    
    [ Upstream commit 48cac18ecf1de82f76259a54402c3adb7839ad01 ]
    
    Andrey reported a use-after-free in IPv6 stack.
    
    Issue here is that we free the socket while it still has skb
    in TX path and in some queues.
    
    It happens here because IPv6 reassembly unit messes skb->truesize,
    breaking skb_set_owner_w() badly.
    
    We fixed a similar issue for IPV4 in commit 8282f27449bf ("inet: frag:
    Always orphan skbs inside ip_defrag()")

    net: net_enable_timestamp() can be called from irq contexts
    
    [ Upstream commit 13baa00ad01bb3a9f893e3a08cbc2d072fc0c15d ]
    
    It is now very clear that silly TCP listeners might play with
    enabling/disabling timestamping while new children are added
    to their accept queue.
    
    Meaning net_enable_timestamp() can be called from BH context
    while current state of the static key is not enabled.
    
    Lets play safe and allow all contexts.
    
    The work queue is scheduled only under the problematic cases,
    which are the static key enable/disable transition, to not slow down
    critical paths.
    
    This extends and improves what we did in commit 5fa8bbda38c6 ("net: use
    a work queue to defer net_disable_timestamp() work")

    (the line numbers are relative to 4.8-rc6, but the bug persists
    upstream)
    
    , when I run the following program as root:
    
    =====================================
     #include <string.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>
     #include <netpacket/packet.h>
     #include <net/ethernet.h>
    
     int main() {
       struct sockaddr addr;
       memset(&addr, 0xff, sizeof(addr));
       addr.sa_family = AF_PACKET;
       int fd = socket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_PACKET, htons(ETH_P_ALL));
       bind(fd, &addr, sizeof(addr));
       return 0;
     }
    =====================================
    
    This happens because addr.sa_data copied from the userspace is not
    zero-terminated, and copying it with strlcpy() in packet_bind_spkt()
    results in calling strlen() on the kernel copy of that non-terminated
    buffer.

    Even with multicast flooding turned off, IPv6 ND should still work so
    that IPv6 connectivity is provided. Allow this by continuing to flood
    multicast traffic originated by us.

    tcp/dccp: block BH for SYN processing
    
    [ Upstream commit 449809a66c1d0b1563dee84493e14bf3104d2d7e ]
    
    SYN processing really was meant to be handled from BH.
    
    When I got rid of BH blocking while processing socket backlog
    in commit 5413d1babe8f ("net: do not block BH while processing socket
    backlog"), I forgot that a malicious user could transition to TCP_LISTEN
    from a state that allowed (SYN) packets to be parked in the socket
    backlog while socket is owned by the thread doing the listen() call.
    
    Sure enough syzkaller found this and reported the bug ;)

    When the structure of the LPM tree changes (f.e., due to the addition of
    a new prefix), we unbind the old tree and then bind the new one. This
    may result in temporary packet loss.
    
    Instead, overwrite the old binding with the new one.

    net sched actions: decrement module reference count after table flush.
    
    [ Upstream commit edb9d1bff4bbe19b8ae0e71b1f38732591a9eeb2 ]
    
    When tc actions are loaded as a module and no actions have been installed,
    flushing them would result in actions removed from the memory, but modules
    reference count not being decremented, so that the modules would not be
    unloaded.
    
    Following is example with GACT action:
    
    % sudo modprobe act_gact

    sctp: set sin_port for addr param when checking duplicate address
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e3ce5bc2aa938653c3866aa7f4901a1f199b1c8 ]
    
    Commit b8607805dd15 ("sctp: not copying duplicate addrs to the assoc's
    bind address list") tried to check for duplicate address before copying
    to asoc's bind_addr list from global addr list.
    
    But all the addrs' sin_ports in global addr list are 0 while the addrs'
    sin_ports are bp->port in asoc's bind_addr list. It means even if it's
    a duplicate address, af->cmp_addr will still return 0 as the their
    sin_ports are different.
    
    This patch is to fix it by setting the sin_port for addr param with
    bp->port before comparing the addrs.

    vxlan: don't allow overwrite of config src addr
    
    [ Upstream commit 1158632b5a2dcce0786c1b1b99654e81cc867981 ]
    
    When using IPv6 transport and a default dst, a pointer to the configured
    source address is passed into the route lookup. If no source address is
    configured, then the value is overwritten.
    
    IPv6 route lookup ignores egress ifindex match if the source address is set,
    so if egress ifindex match is desired, the source address must be passed
    as any. The overwrite breaks this for subsequent lookups.
    
    Avoid this by copying the configured address to an existing stack variable
    and pass a pointer to that instead.

    sctp: deny peeloff operation on asocs with threads sleeping on it
    
    [ Upstream commit dfcb9f4f99f1e9a49e43398a7bfbf56927544af1 ]
    
    commit 2dcab5984841 ("sctp: avoid BUG_ON on sctp_wait_for_sndbuf")
    attempted to avoid a BUG_ON call when the association being used for a
    sendmsg() is blocked waiting for more sndbuf and another thread did a
    peeloff operation on such asoc, moving it to another socket.
    
    As Ben Hutchings noticed, then in such case it would return without
    locking back the socket and would cause two unlocks in a row.
    
    Further analysis also revealed that it could allow a double free if the
    application managed to peeloff the asoc that is created during the
    sendmsg call, because then sctp_sendmsg() would try to free the asoc
    that was created only for that call.
    
    This patch takes another approach. It will deny the peeloff operation
    if there is a thread sleeping on the asoc, so this situation doesn't
    exist anymore. This avoids the issues described above and also honors
    the syscalls that are already being handled (it can be multiple sendmsg
    calls).
    
    Joint work with Xin Long.

    net/mlx5e: Fix wrong CQE decompression
    
    [ Upstream commit 36154be40a28e4afaa0416da2681d80b7e2ca319 ]
    
    In cqe compression with striding RQ, the decompression of the CQE field
    wqe_counter was done with a wrong wraparound value.
    This caused handling cqes with a wrong pointer to wqe (rx descriptor)
    and creating SKBs with wrong data, pointing to wrong (and already consumed)
    strides/pages.
    
    The meaning of the CQE field wqe_counter in striding RQ holds the
    stride index instead of the WQE index. Hence, when decompressing
    a CQE, wqe_counter should have wrapped-around the number of strides
    in a single multi-packet WQE.
    
    We dropped this wrap-around mask at all in CQE decompression of striding
    RQ. It is not needed as in such cases the CQE compression session would
    break because of different value of wqe_id field, starting a new
    compression session.
    
    Tested:
     ethtool -K ethxx lro off/on
     ethtool --set-priv-flags ethxx rx_cqe_compress on
     super_netperf 16 {ipv4,ipv6} -t TCP_STREAM -m 50 -D

    net/mlx5e: Update MPWQE stride size when modifying CQE compress state
    
    [ Upstream commit 6dc4b54e77282caf17f0ff72aa32dd296037fbc0 ]
    
    When the admin enables/disables cqe compression, updating
    mpwqe stride size is required:
        CQE compress ON  ==> stride size = 256B
        CQE compress OFF ==> stride size = 64B
    
    This is already done on driver load via mlx5e_set_rq_type_params, all we
    need is just to call it on arbitrary admin changes of cqe compression
    state via priv flags or when changing timestamping state
    (as it is mutually exclusive with cqe compression).
    
    This bug introduces no functional damage, it only makes cqe compression
    occur less often, since in ConnectX4-LX CQE compression is performed
    only on packets smaller than stride size.
    
    Tested:
     ethtool --set-priv-flags ethxx rx_cqe_compress on
     pktgen with  64 < pkt size < 256 and netperf TCP_STREAM (IPv4/IPv6)
     verify `ethtool -S ethxx | grep compress` are advancing more often
     (rapidly)

    net/mlx5e: Fix broken CQE compression initialization
    
    [ Upstream commit b0d4660b4cc52e6477ca3a43435351d565dfcedc ]
    
    Some of RQ type parameters are derived from CQE compression state flag,
    CQE compression flag was initialized only after RQ type parameters
    setup. This leads to load RQ with stride size smaller than what we
    want for when CQE compression is on.

    occur less often, since in ConnectX4-LX CQE compression is performed
    only on packets smaller than stride size.
    
    Fix this by marking default status of CQE compression in PFLAG prior to
    calling mlx5e_set_rq_priv_params(), as it inits some fields based on it.
    
    Tested:
     load driver on systems where rx CQE compress will be on (MH)
     pktgen with  64 < pkt size < 256 and netperf TCP_STREAM (IPv4/IPv6)
     verify `ethtool -S ethxx | grep compress` are advancing more often
     (rapidly)

    net/mlx5e: Do not reduce LRO WQE size when not using build_skb
    
    [ Upstream commit 4078e637c12f1e0a74293f1ec9563f42bff14a03 ]
    
    When rq_type is Striding RQ, no room of SKB_RESERVE is needed
    as SKB allocation is not done via build_skb.

    net/mlx5e: Register/unregister vport representors on interface attach/detach
    
    [ Upstream commit 6f08a22c5fb2b9aefb8ecd8496758e7a677c1fde ]
    
    Currently vport representors are added only on driver load and removed on
    driver unload.  Apparently we forgot to handle them when we added the
    seamless reset flow feature.  This caused to leave the representors
    netdevs alive and active with open HW resources on pci shutdown and on
    error reset flows.
    
    To overcome this we move their handling to interface attach/detach, so
    they would be cleaned up on shutdown and recreated on reset flows.
