    md: fix race when unfreezing sync_action
    
    commit 56ccc1125bc141cf63927eda7febff4216dea2d3 upstream.
    
    A recent change removed the need for locking around writing
    to "sync_action" (and various other places), but introduced a
    subtle race.
    When e.g. setting 'reshape' on a 'frozen' array, the 'frozen'
    flag is cleared before 'reshape' is set, so the md thread can
    get in and start trying recovery - which isn't wanted.
    
    So instead of clearing MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN for any command
    except 'frozen', only clear it when each specific command
    is parsed.  This allows the handling of 'reshape' to clear
    the bit while a lock is held.
    
    Also remove some places where we set MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED,
    as it is always set on non-error exit of the function.

    pwm: img: Impose upper and lower timebase steps value
    
    commit 1e70897d0e20f988abedcf73b33684ecd2be9511 upstream.
    
    The PWM hardware on Pistachio platform has a maximum timebase steps
    value to 255. To fix it, let's introduce a compatible-specific
    data structure to contain the SoC-specific details and use it to
    specify a maximum timebase.
    
    Also, let's limit the minimum timebase to 16 steps, to allow a sane
    range of duty cycle steps.

    UBI: block: Add missing cache flushes
    
    commit 98fb1ffd8154890d7051750e61ff5548c3ee2ab2 upstream.
    
    Block drivers are responsible for calling flush_dcache_page() on each
    BIO request. This operation keeps the I$ coherent with the D$ on
    architectures that don't have hardware coherency support. Without this
    flush, random crashes are seen when executing user programs from an ext4
    filesystem backed by a ubiblock device.
    
    This patch is based on the change implemented in commit 2d4dc890b5c8
    ("block: add helpers to run flush_dcache_page() against a bio and a
    request's pages").

    vfs: read file_handle only once in handle_to_path
    
    commit 161f873b89136eb1e69477c847d5a5033239d9ba upstream.
    
    We used to read file_handle twice.  Once to get the amount of extra
    bytes, and once to fetch the entire structure.
    
    This may be problematic since we do size verifications only after the
    first read, so if the number of extra bytes changes in userspace between
    the first and second calls, we'll have an incoherent view of
    file_handle.
    
    Instead, read the constant size once, and copy that over to the final
    structure without having to re-read it again.

    dm: fix reload failure of 0 path multipath mapping on blk-mq devices
    
    commit 15b94a690470038aa08247eedbebbe7e2218d5ee upstream.
    
    dm-multipath accepts 0 path mapping.
    
      # echo '0 2097152 multipath 0 0 0 0' | dmsetup create newdev
    
    Such a mapping can be used to release underlying devices while still
    holding requests in its queue until working paths come back.
    
    However, once the multipath device is created over blk-mq devices,
    it rejects reloading of 0 path mapping:
    
      # echo '0 2097152 multipath 0 0 1 1 queue-length 0 1 1 /dev/sda 1' \
          | dmsetup create mpath1
      # echo '0 2097152 multipath 0 0 0 0' | dmsetup load mpath1
      device-mapper: reload ioctl on mpath1 failed: Invalid argument
      Command failed
    
    With following kernel message:
      device-mapper: ioctl: can't change device type after initial table load.
    
    DM tries to inherit the current table type using dm_table_set_type()
    but it doesn't work as expected because of unnecessary check about
    whether the target type is hybrid or not.
    
    Hybrid type is for targets that work as either request-based or bio-based
    and not required for blk-mq or non blk-mq checking.

    dm: fix casting bug in dm_merge_bvec()
    
    commit 1c220c69ce0dcc0f234a9f263ad9c0864f971852 upstream.
    
    dm_merge_bvec() was originally added in f6fccb ("dm: introduce
    merge_bvec_fn").  In that commit a value in sectors is converted to
    bytes using << 9, and then assigned to an int.  This code made
    assumptions about the value of BIO_MAX_SECTORS.
    
    A later commit 148e51 ("dm: improve documentation and code clarity in
    dm_merge_bvec") was meant to have no functional change but it removed
    the use of BIO_MAX_SECTORS in favor of using queue_max_sectors().  At
    this point the cast from sector_t to int resulted in a zero value.  The
    fallout being dm_merge_bvec() would only allow a single page to be added
    to a bio.
    
    This interim fix is minimal for the benefit of stable@ because the more
    comprehensive cleanup of passing a sector_t to all DM targets' merge
    function will impact quite a few DM targets.

    ACPI / init: Fix the ordering of acpi_reserve_resources()
    
    commit b9a5e5e18fbf223502c0b2264c15024e393da928 upstream.
    
    Since acpi_reserve_resources() is defined as a device_initcall(),
    there's no guarantee that it will be executed in the right order
    with respect to the rest of the ACPI initialization code.  On some
    systems this leads to breakage if, for example, the address range
    that should be reserved for the ACPI fixed registers is given to
    the PCI host bridge instead if the race is won by the wrong code
    path.
    
    Fix this by turning acpi_reserve_resources() into a void function
    and calling it directly from within the ACPI initialization sequence.

    Input: elantech - fix semi-mt protocol for v3 HW
    
    commit 3c0213d17a09601e0c6c0ae0e27caf70d988290f upstream.
    
    When the v3 hardware sees more than one finger, it uses the semi-mt
    protocol to report the touches. However, it currently works when
    num_fingers is 0, 1 or 2, but when it is 3 and above, it sends only 1
    finger as if num_fingers was 1.
    
    This confuses userspace which knows how to deal with extra fingers
    when all the slots are used, but not when some are missing.

    rtlwifi: rtl8192cu: Fix kernel deadlock

    The USB mini-driver in rtlwifi, which is used by rtl8192cu, issues a call to

    MIPS: fix FP mode selection in lieu of .MIPS.abiflags data
    
    commit 620b155034570f577470cf5309f741bac6a6e32b upstream.
    
    Commit 46490b572544 ("MIPS: kernel: elf: Improve the overall ABI and FPU
    mode checks") reworked the ELF FP ABI mode selection logic, but when
    CONFIG_MIPS_O32_FP64_SUPPORT is enabled it breaks the use of binaries
    which have no PT_MIPS_ABIFLAGS program header & associated
    .MIPS.abiflags section.
    
    A default mode is selected based upon whether the ELF contains MIPS32 or
    MIPS64 code, but that selection is made in arch_elf_pt_proc.
    arch_elf_pt_proc only executes when a PT_MIPS_ABIFLAGS program header is
    found. If one is not found then arch_elf_pt_proc is never called, and no
    default overall_fp_mode value is selected. When arch_check_elf is
    called, both abi0 & abi1 are MIPS_ABI_FP_UNKNOWN which leads to both
    prog_req & interp_req being set to none_req. none_req matches none of
    the conditions for mode selection at the end of arch_check_elf, so
    overall_fp_mode is left untouched. Finally once mips_set_personality_fp
    is called the BUG() in the default case is then hit & the kernel likely
    panics.
    
    Fix this by moving the selection of a default overall mode to the start
    of arch_check_elf, which runs once per ELF executed regardless of
    whether it has a PT_MIPS_ABIFLAGS program header.

    Revert "HID: logitech-hidpp: support combo keyboard touchpad TK820"
    
    commit 5006c1052aafa01dab5b0e643b7dac755b41f3bb upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 3a61e97563d78a2ca10752902449570d8433ce76.
    
    The Logitech TK820 seems to be affected by a firmware bug which
    delays the sending of the keys (pressed, or released, which triggers
    a key-repeat) while holding fingers on the touch sensor.
    This behavior can be observed while using the mouse emulation mode
    if the user moves the finger while typing (highly improbable though).
    Holding the finger still while in the mouse emulation mode does
    not trigger the key repeat problem.
    So better keep things in their previous state to not have to
    explain users that the new key-repeat bug they see is a "feature".
    
    Furthermore, I noticed that I disabled the media keys whith
    this patch. Sorry, my bad.
    
    I think it is best to revert the patch, in all the current
    versions it has been shipped.

    md/raid0: fix restore to sector variable in raid0_make_request
    
    commit a81157768a00e8cf8a7b43b5ea5cac931262374f upstream.
    
    The variable "sector" in "raid0_make_request()" was improperly updated
    by a call to "sector_div()" which modifies its first argument in place.
    Commit 47d68979cc968535cb87f3e5f2e6a3533ea48fbd restored this variable
    after the call for later re-use.  Unfortunetly the restore was done after
    the referenced variable "bio" was advanced.  This lead to the original
    value and the restored value being different.  Here we move this line to
    the proper place.
    
    One observed side effect of this bug was discarding a file though
    unlinking would cause an unrelated file's contents to be discarded.

    commit 6e9eac2dcee5e19f125967dd2be3e36558c42fff upstream.
    
    If any memory allocation in resize_stripes fails we will return
    -ENOMEM, but in some cases we update conf->pool_size anyway.
    
    This means that if we try again, the allocations will be assumed
    to be larger than they are, and badness results.
    
    So only update pool_size if there is no error.
    
    This bug was introduced in 2.6.17 and the patch is suitable for
    -stable.

    firmware: dmi_scan: Fix ordering of product_uuid
    
    commit 5c1ac56b51b9d222ab202dec1ac2f4215346129d upstream.
    
    In function dmi_present(), dmi_walk_early() calls dmi_table(), which
    calls dmi_decode(), which ultimately calls dmi_save_uuid(). This last
    function makes a decision based on the value of global variable
    dmi_ver. The problem is that this variable is set right _after_
    dmi_walk_early() returns. So dmi_save_uuid() always sees dmi_ver == 0
    regardless of the actual version implemented.
    
    This causes /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid to always use the old
    ordering even on systems implementing DMI/SMBIOS 2.6 or later, which
    should use the new ordering.
    
    This is broken since kernel v3.8 for legacy DMI implementations and
    since kernel v3.10 for SMBIOS 2 implementations. SMBIOS 3
    implementations with the 64-bit entry point are not affected.
    
    The first breakage does not matter much as in practice legacy DMI
    implementations are always for versions older than 2.6, which is when
    the UUID ordering changed. The second breakage is more problematic as
    it affects the vast majority of x86 systems manufactured since 2009.

    In an environment where the KDC is running Active Directory, the

    enough to span a page boundary.  Attaching a scratch buffer to the

    commit 40cdc7a530c7a075557651a071354bb42b99df08 upstream.
    
    Commit df52699e4fcef ("NFSv4.1: Don't cache deviceids that have no
    notifications") causes the Linux NFS client to stop caching deviceid's
    unless a server pretends to support deviceid notifications.  While this
    behavior is stupid and the language around this area in rfc5661 is a
    mess carified by an errata that I submittted, Trond insists on this
    behavior.  Not caching deviceids degrades block layout performance
    massively as a GETDEVICEINFO is fairly expensive.
    
    So add this hack to make the Linux client happy again.

    commit b0dc2b9bb4ab782115b964310518ee0b17784277 upstream.
    
    NUMA balancing is meant to be disabled by default on UMA machines but
    the check is using nr_node_ids (highest node) instead of
    num_online_nodes (online nodes).
    
    The consequences are that a UMA machine with a node ID of 1 or higher
    will enable NUMA balancing.  This will incur useless overhead due to
    minor faults with the impact depending on the workload.  These are the
    impact on the stats when running a kernel build on a single node machine
    whose node ID happened to be 1:
    
                                   vanilla     patched
      NUMA base PTE updates          5113158           0
      NUMA huge PMD updates              643           0
      NUMA page range updates        5442374           0

    kernfs: do not account ino_ida allocations to memcg
    
    commit 499611ed451508a42d1d7d1faff10177827755d5 upstream.
    
    root->ino_ida is used for kernfs inode number allocations. Since IDA has
    a layered structure, different IDs can reside on the same layer, which
    is currently accounted to some memory cgroup. The problem is that each
    kmem cache of a memory cgroup has its own directory on sysfs (under
    /sys/fs/kernel/<cache-name>/cgroup). If the inode number of such a
    directory or any file in it gets allocated from a layer accounted to the
    cgroup which the cache is created for, the cgroup will get pinned for
    good, because one has to free all kmem allocations accounted to a cgroup
    in order to release it and destroy all its kmem caches. That said we
    must not account layers of ino_ida to any memory cgroup.
    
    Since per net init operations may create new sysfs entries directly
    (e.g. lo device) or indirectly (nf_conntrack creates a new kmem cache
    per each namespace, which, in turn, creates new sysfs entries), an easy
    way to reproduce this issue is by creating network namespace(s) from
    inside a kmem-active memory cgroup.

    gfp: add __GFP_NOACCOUNT
    
    commit 8f4fc071b1926d0b20336e2b3f8ab85c94c734c5 upstream.
    
    Not all kmem allocations should be accounted to memcg.  The following
    patch gives an example when accounting of a certain type of allocations to
    memcg can effectively result in a memory leak.  This patch adds the
    __GFP_NOACCOUNT flag which if passed to kmalloc and friends will force the
    allocation to go through the root cgroup.  It will be used by the next
    patch.
    
    Note, since in case of kmemleak enabled each kmalloc implies yet another
    allocation from the kmemleak_object cache, we add __GFP_NOACCOUNT to
    gfp_kmemleak_mask.
    
    Alternatively, we could introduce a per kmem cache flag disabling
    accounting for all allocations of a particular kind, but (a) we would not
    be able to bypass accounting for kmalloc then and (b) a kmem cache with
    this flag set could not be merged with a kmem cache without this flag,
    which would increase the number of global caches and therefore
    fragmentation even if the memory cgroup controller is not used.
    
    Despite its generic name, currently __GFP_NOACCOUNT disables accounting
    only for kmem allocations while user page allocations are always charged.
    To catch abusing of this flag, a warning is issued on an attempt of
    passing it to mem_cgroup_try_charge.

    parisc,metag: Fix crashes due to stack randomization on stack-grows-upwards architectures
    
    commit d045c77c1a69703143a36169c224429c48b9eecd upstream.
    
    On architectures where the stack grows upwards (CONFIG_STACK_GROWSUP=y,
    currently parisc and metag only) stack randomization sometimes leads to crashes
    when the stack ulimit is set to lower values than STACK_RND_MASK (which is 8 MB
    by default if not defined in arch-specific headers).
    
    The problem is, that when the stack vm_area_struct is set up in fs/exec.c, the
    additional space needed for the stack randomization (as defined by the value of
    STACK_RND_MASK) was not taken into account yet and as such, when the stack
    randomization code added a random offset to the stack start, the stack
    effectively got smaller than what the user defined via rlimit_max(RLIMIT_STACK)
    which then sometimes leads to out-of-stack situations and crashes.
    
    This patch fixes it by adding the maximum possible amount of memory (based on
    STACK_RND_MASK) which theoretically could be added by the stack randomization
    code to the initial stack size. That way, the user-defined stack size is always
    guaranteed to be at minimum what is defined via rlimit_max(RLIMIT_STACK).
    
    This bug is currently not visible on the metag architecture, because on metag
    STACK_RND_MASK is defined to 0 which effectively disables stack randomization.
    
    The changes to fs/exec.c are inside an "#ifdef CONFIG_STACK_GROWSUP"
    section, so it does not affect other platformws beside those where the
    stack grows upwards (parisc and metag).

    ARM: fix missing syscall trace exit
    
    commit 1b97937246d8b97c0760d16d8992c7937bdf5e6a upstream.
    
    Josh Stone reports:
    
      I've discovered a case where both arm and arm64 will miss a ptrace
      syscall-exit that they should report.  If the syscall is entered
      without TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE set, then it goes on the fast path.  It's
      then possible to have TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE added in the middle of the
      syscall, but ret_fast_syscall doesn't check this flag again.
    
    Fix this by always checking for a syscall trace in the fast exit path.

    ARM: 8356/1: mm: handle non-pmd-aligned end of RAM
    
    commit 965278dcb8ab0b1f666cc47937933c4be4aea48d upstream.
    
    At boot time we round the memblock limit down to section size in an
    attempt to ensure that we will have mapped this RAM with section
    mappings prior to allocating from it. When mapping RAM we iterate over
    PMD-sized chunks, creating these section mappings.
    
    Section mappings are only created when the end of a chunk is aligned to
    section size. Unfortunately, with classic page tables (where PMD_SIZE is
    2 * SECTION_SIZE) this means that if a chunk is between 1M and 2M in
    size the first 1M will not be mapped despite having been accounted for
    in the memblock limit. This has been observed to result in page tables
    being allocated from unmapped memory, causing boot-time hangs.
    
    This patch modifies the memblock limit rounding to always round down to
    PMD_SIZE instead of SECTION_SIZE. For classic MMU this means that we
    will round the memblock limit down to a 2M boundary, matching the limits
    on section mappings, and preventing allocations from unmapped memory.
    For LPAE there should be no change as PMD_SIZE == SECTION_SIZE.

    sched: always use blk_schedule_flush_plug in io_schedule_out
    
    commit 10d784eae2b41e25d8fc6a88096cd27286093c84 upstream.
    
    block plug callback could sleep, so we introduce a parameter
    'from_schedule' and corresponding drivers can use it to destinguish a
    schedule plug flush or a plug finish. Unfortunately io_schedule_out
    still uses blk_flush_plug(). This causes below output (Note, I added a
    might_sleep() in raid1_unplug to make it trigger faster, but the whole
    thing doesn't matter if I add might_sleep). In raid1/10, this can cause
    deadlock.
    
    This patch makes io_schedule_out always uses blk_schedule_flush_plug.
    This should only impact drivers (as far as I know, raid 1/10) which are
    sensitive to the 'from_schedule' parameter.

    sched: Handle priority boosted tasks proper in setscheduler()
    
    commit 0782e63bc6fe7e2d3408d250df11d388b7799c6b upstream.
    
    Ronny reported that the following scenario is not handled correctly:
    
            T1 (prio = 10)
               lock(rtmutex);
    
            T2 (prio = 20)
               lock(rtmutex)
                  boost T1
    
            T1 (prio = 20)
               sys_set_scheduler(prio = 30)
               T1 prio = 30
               ....
               sys_set_scheduler(prio = 10)
               T1 prio = 30
    
    The last step is wrong as T1 should now be back at prio 20.
    
    Commit c365c292d059 ("sched: Consider pi boosting in setscheduler()")
    only handles the case where a boosted tasks tries to lower its
    priority.
    
    Fix it by taking the new effective priority into account for the
    decision whether a change of the priority is required.

    No matter how the driver manages its NAPI context, there's no way
    sending frames to it from a timer can be correct, since it would
    corrupt the internal GRO lists.
    
    To avoid that, always use the non-NAPI path when releasing frames
    from the timer.

    This patch fixes an inverted return value of the gpio get_direction

    The wrong value causes the direction sysfs entry and GPIO debugfs file
    to indicate incorrect GPIO direction settings. In some cases it also
    prevents setting GPIO output values.

    Consider "(u64)insn1.imm << 32 | imm" in the arm64 JIT.  Since imm is
    signed 32-bit, it is sign-extended to 64-bit, losing the high 32 bits.
    The fix is to convert imm to u32 first, which will be zero-extended to

    libata: Ignore spurious PHY event on LPM policy change
    
    commit 09c5b4803a80a5451d950d6a539d2eb311dc0fb1 upstream.
    
    When the LPM policy is set to ATA_LPM_MAX_POWER, the device might
    generate a spurious PHY event that cuases errors on the link.
    Ignore this event if it occured within 10s after the policy change.
    
    The timeout was chosen observing that on a Dell XPS13 9333 these
    spurious events can occur up to roughly 6s after the policy change.

    jbd2: fix r_count overflows leading to buffer overflow in journal recovery
    
    commit e531d0bceb402e643a4499de40dd3fa39d8d2e43 upstream.
    
    The journal revoke block recovery code does not check r_count for
    sanity, which means that an evil value of r_count could result in
    the kernel reading off the end of the revoke table and into whatever
    garbage lies beyond.  This could crash the kernel, so fix that.
    
    However, in testing this fix, I discovered that the code to write
    out the revoke tables also was not correctly checking to see if the
    block was full -- the current offset check is fine so long as the
    revoke table space size is a multiple of the record size, but this
    is not true when either journal_csum_v[23] are set.

    ext4: fix NULL pointer dereference when journal restart fails
    
    commit 9d506594069355d1fb2de3f9104667312ff08ed3 upstream.
    
    Currently when journal restart fails, we'll have the h_transaction of
    the handle set to NULL to indicate that the handle has been effectively
    aborted. We handle this situation quietly in the jbd2_journal_stop() and just
    free the handle and exit because everything else has been done before we
    attempted (and failed) to restart the journal.
    
    Unfortunately there are a number of problems with that approach
    introduced with commit
    
    41a5b913197c "jbd2: invalidate handle if jbd2_journal_restart()
    fails"
    
    First of all in ext4 jbd2_journal_stop() will be called through
    __ext4_journal_stop() where we would try to get a hold of the superblock
    by dereferencing h_transaction which in this case would lead to NULL
    pointer dereference and crash.
    
    In addition we're going to free the handle regardless of the refcount
    which is bad as well, because others up the call chain will still
    reference the handle so we might potentially reference already freed
    memory.
    
    Moreover it's expected that we'll get aborted handle as well as detached
    handle in some of the journalling function as the error propagates up
    the stack, so it's unnecessary to call WARN_ON every time we get
    detached handle.
    
    And finally we might leak some memory by forgetting to free reserved
    handle in jbd2_journal_stop() in the case where handle was detached from
    the transaction (h_transaction is NULL).
    
    Fix the NULL pointer dereference in __ext4_journal_stop() by just
    calling jbd2_journal_stop() quietly as suggested by Jan Kara. Also fix
    the potential memory leak in jbd2_journal_stop() and use proper
    handle refcounting before we attempt to free it to avoid use-after-free
    issues.
    
    And finally remove all WARN_ON(!transaction) from the code so that we do
    not get random traces when something goes wrong because when journal
    restart fails we will get to some of those functions.

    ext4: fix lazytime optimization
    
    commit 8f4d855839179f410fa910a26eb81d646d628f26 upstream.
    
    We had a fencepost error in the lazytime optimization which means that
    timestamp would get written to the wrong inode.

    pty: Fix input race when closing
    
    commit 1a48632ffed61352a7810ce089dc5a8bcd505a60 upstream.
    
    A read() from a pty master may mistakenly indicate EOF (errno == -EIO)
    after the pty slave has closed, even though input data remains to be read.
    For example,
    
           pty slave       |        input worker        |    pty master
                           |                            |
                           |                            |   n_tty_read()
    pty_write()            |                            |     input avail? no
      add data             |                            |     sleep
      schedule worker  --->|                            |     .
                           |---> flush_to_ldisc()       |     .
    pty_close()            |       fill read buffer     |     .
      wait for worker      |       wakeup reader    --->|     .
                           |       read buffer full?    |---> input avail ? yes
                           |<---   yes - exit worker    |     copy 4096 bytes to user
      TTY_OTHER_CLOSED <---|                            |<--- kick worker
                           |                            |
    
                                    **** New read() before worker starts ****
    
                           |                            |   n_tty_read()
                           |                            |     input avail? no
                           |                            |     TTY_OTHER_CLOSED? yes
                           |                            |     return -EIO
    
    Several conditions are required to trigger this race:
    1. the ldisc read buffer must become full so the input worker exits
    2. the read() count parameter must be >= 4096 so the ldisc read buffer
       is empty
    3. the subsequent read() occurs before the kicked worker has processed
       more input
    
    However, the underlying cause of the race is that data is pipelined, while
    tty state is not; ie., data already written by the pty slave end is not
    yet visible to the pty master end, but state changes by the pty slave end
    are visible to the pty master end immediately.
    
    Pipeline the TTY_OTHER_CLOSED state through input worker to the reader.
    1. Introduce TTY_OTHER_DONE which is set by the input worker when
       TTY_OTHER_CLOSED is set and either the input buffers are flushed or
       input processing has completed. Readers/polls are woken when
       TTY_OTHER_DONE is set.
    2. Reader/poll checks TTY_OTHER_DONE instead of TTY_OTHER_CLOSED.
    3. A new input worker is started from pty_close() after setting
       TTY_OTHER_CLOSED, which ensures the TTY_OTHER_DONE state will be
       set if the last input worker is already finished (or just about to
       exit).
    
    Remove tty_flush_to_ldisc(); no in-tree callers.

    tty/n_gsm.c: fix a memory leak when gsmtty is removed
    
    commit 8f9cfeed3eae86c70d3b04445a6f2036b27b6304 upstream.
    
    when gsmtty_remove put dlci, it will cause memory leak if dlci->port's refcount is zero.
    So we do the cleanup work in .cleanup callback instead.
    
    dlci will be last put in two call chains.
    1) gsmld_close -> gsm_cleanup_mux -> gsm_dlci_release -> dlci_put
    2) gsmld_remove -> dlci_put
    so there is a race. the memory leak depends on the race.
    
    In call chain 2. we hit the memory leak. below comment tells.
    
    release_tty -> tty_driver_remove_tty -> gsmtty_remove -> dlci_put -> tty_port_destructor (WARN_ON(port->itty) and return directly)
                             |
                    tty->port->itty = NULL;
                             |
                    tty_kref_put ---> release_one_tty -> gsmtty_cleanup (added by our patch)
    
    So our patch fix the memory leak by doing the cleanup work after tty core did.

    powerpc: Align TOC to 256 bytes
    
    commit 5e95235ccd5442d4a4fe11ec4eb99ba1b7959368 upstream.
    
    Recent toolchains force the TOC to be 256 byte aligned. We need
    to enforce this alignment in our linker script, otherwise pointers
    to our TOC variables (__toc_start, __prom_init_toc_start) could
    be incorrect.
    
    If they are bad, we die a few hundred instructions into boot.

    powerpc/mce: fix off by one errors in mce event handling
    
    commit ffb2d78eca08a1451137583d4e435aecfd6af809 upstream.
    
    Before 69111bac42f5 ("powerpc: Replace __get_cpu_var uses"), in
    save_mce_event, index got the value of mce_nest_count, and
    mce_nest_count was incremented *after* index was set.
    
    However, that patch changed the behaviour so that mce_nest count was
    incremented *before* setting index.
    
    This causes an off-by-one error, as get_mce_event sets index as
    mce_nest_count - 1 before reading mce_event.  Thus get_mce_event reads
    bogus data, causing warnings like
    "Machine Check Exception, Unknown event version 0 !"
    and breaking MCEs handling.
    
    Restore the old behaviour and unbreak MCE handling by subtracting one
    from the newly incremented value.
    
    The same broken change occured in machine_check_queue_event (which set
    a queue read by machine_check_process_queued_event).  Fix that too,
    unbreaking printing of MCE information.

    Most of kernel code assume that interface array in
    struct usb_configuration is NULL terminated.
    
    When gadget is composed with configfs configuration
    structure may be reused for different functions set.
    
    This bug happens because purge_configs_funcs() sets
    only next_interface_id to 0. Interface array still
    contains pointers to already freed interfaces. If in
    second try we add less interfaces than earlier we
    may access unallocated memory when trying to get
    interface descriptors.

    USB: visor: Match I330 phone more precisely
    
    commit 82ee3aeb9295c5fc37fd2ddf20f13ac2b40ec97d upstream.
    
    Samsung has just released a portable USB3 SSD, coming in a very small
    and nice form factor. It's USB ID is 04e8:8001, which unfortunately is
    already used by the Palm Visor driver for the Samsung I330 phone cradle.
    Having pl2303 or visor pick up this device ID results in conflicts with
    the usb-storage driver, which handles the newly released portable USB3
    SSD.
    
    To work around this conflict, I've dug up a mailing list post [1] from a
    long time ago, in which a user posts the full USB descriptor
    information. The most specific value in this appears to be the interface
    class, which has value 255 (0xff). Since usb-storage requires an
    interface class of 0x8, I believe it's correct to disambiguate the two
    devices by matching on 0xff inside visor.

    xhci: Solve full event ring by increasing TRBS_PER_SEGMENT to 256
    
    commit 18cc2f4cbbaf825a4fedcf2d60fd388d291e0a38 upstream.
    
    Our event ring consists of only one segment, and we risk filling
    the event ring in case we get isoc transfers with short intervals
    such as webcams that fill a TD every microframe (125us)
    
    With 64 TRB segment size one usb camera could fill the event ring in 8ms.
    A setup with several cameras and other devices can fill up the
    event ring as it is shared between all devices.
    This has occurred when uvcvideo queues 5 * 32TD URBs which then
    get cancelled when the video mode changes. The cancelled URBs are returned
    in the xhci interrupt context and blocks the interrupt handler from
    handling the new events.
    
    A full event ring will block xhci from scheduling traffic and affect all
    devices conneted to the xhci, will see errors such as Missed Service
    Intervals for isoc devices, and  and Split transaction errors for LS/FS
    interrupt devices.
    
    Increasing the TRB_PER_SEGMENT will also increase the default endpoint ring
    size, which is welcome as for most isoc transfer we had to dynamically
    expand the endpoint ring anyway to be able to queue the 5 * 32TDs uvcvideo
    queues.
    
    The default size used to be 64 TRBs per segment

    xhci: fix isoc endpoint dequeue from advancing too far on transaction error
    
    commit d104d0152a97fade389f47635b73a9ccc7295d0b upstream.
    
    Isoc TDs usually consist of one TRB, sometimes two. When all goes well we
    receive only one success event for a TD, and move the dequeue pointer to
    the next TD.
    
    This fails if the TD consists of two TRBs and we get a transfer error
    on the first TRB, we will then see two events for that TD.
    
    Fix this by making sure the event we get is for the last TRB in that TD
    before moving the dequeue pointer to the next TD. This will resolve some
    of the uvc and dvb issues with the
    "ERROR Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD" error message

    ALSA: hda - Fix noise on AMD radeon 290x controller
    
    commit 0fa372b6c95013af1334b3d5c9b5f03a70ecedab upstream.
    
    A new AMD controller [1002:aac8] seems to need the quirk for other AMD
    NS HDMI stuff, otherwise it gives noisy sounds.

    Revert "ALSA: hda - Add mute-LED mode control to Thinkpad"
    
    commit 3530febb5c7636f6b26d15637f68296804d26491 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 7290006d8c0900c56d8c58428134f02c35109d17.
    
    Through the regression report, it was revealed that the
    tpacpi_led_set() call to thinkpad_acpi helper doesn't only toggle the
    mute LED but actually mutes the sound.  This is contradiction to the
    expectation, and rather confuses user.
    
    According to Henrique, it's not trivial to judge which TP model
    behaves "LED-only" and which model does whatever more intrusive, as
    Lenovo's implementations vary model by model.  So, from the safety
    reason, we should revert the patch for now.

    module: Call module notifier on failure after complete_formation()
    
    commit 37815bf866ab6722a47550f8d25ad3f1a16a680c upstream.
    
    The module notifier call chain for MODULE_STATE_COMING was moved up before
    the parsing of args, into the complete_formation() call. But if the module failed
    to load after that, the notifier call chain for MODULE_STATE_GOING was
    never called and that prevented the users of those call chains from
    cleaning up anything that was allocated.

    clk: add missing lock when call clk_core_enable in clk_set_parent
    
    commit d2a5d46b167a9a8231264daf80165b739aecf1d7 upstream.
    
    Before commit 035a61c314eb ("clk: Make clk API return per-user
    struct clk instances") we acquired the enable_lock in
    __clk_set_parent_{before,after}() by means of calling
    clk_enable(). After commit 035a61c314eb we use clk_core_enable()
    in place of the clk_enable(), and clk_core_enable() doesn't
    acquire the enable_lock. This opens up a race condition between
    clk_set_parent() and clk_enable(). Fix it.

    clk: exynos5420: Restore GATE_BUS_TOP on suspend
    
    commit 97372e5a99449b4fffa824a382ad6358066a9918 upstream.
    
    Commit ae43b3289186 ("ARM: 8202/1: dmaengine: pl330: Add runtime Power
    Management support v12") added pm support for the pl330 dma driver but
    it makes the clock for the Exynos5420 MDMA0 DMA controller to be gated
    during suspend and this in turn makes its parent clock aclk266_g2d to
    be gated. But the clock needs to be ungated prior suspend to allow the
    system to be suspend and resumed correctly.
    
    Add GATE_BUS_TOP register to the list of registers to be restored when
    the system enters into a suspend state so aclk266_g2d will be ungated.
    
    Thanks to Abhilash Kesavan for figuring out that this was the issue.

    commit 97ffae1d30c3f6ceee67d5b0d3e540c08c13c744 upstream.
    
    The VREFN channel is bipolar, not unipolar. Small negative values do
    occur (e.g., -1mV), and unsigned conversion maps them incorrectly to
    large positive values (about +1V), so fix this.

    commit 713276ea88a295a79aa6633ba639ed47692a8de4 upstream.
    
    At present we are incorrectly setting the register to 0x1 to power up
    the ADC. Since it is an active high power down register, we need to set
    the register to 0x0 to actually power up. Conversely, writing 0x1 to the
    register powers it down.
    
    This commit adds a couple of helpers to make the code clearer and then
    use them to do the power-up/power-down properly.

    iio: adc: cc10001: Fix the channel number mapping
    
    commit 13415a998adb1802b5bd6bd5a336331589e866a1 upstream.
    
    When some of the ADC channels are reserved for remote CPUs,
    the scan index and the corresponding channel number doesn't
    match. This leads to convesion on the incorrect channel during
    triggered capture.
    
    Fix this by using a scan index to channel mapping encoded
    in the iio_chan_spec for this purpose while starting conversion
    on a particular ADC channel in trigger handler.
    
    Also, the channel_map is not really used anywhere but in probe(), so
    no need to keep track of it. Remove it from device structure.
    
    While here, add 1 to number of channels to register timestamp channel
    with the IIO core.

    xen/events: don't bind non-percpu VIRQs with percpu chip
    
    commit 77bb3dfdc0d554befad58fdefbc41be5bc3ed38a upstream.
    
    A non-percpu VIRQ (e.g., VIRQ_CONSOLE) may be freed on a different
    VCPU than it is bound to.  This can result in a race between
    handle_percpu_irq() and removing the action in __free_irq() because
    handle_percpu_irq() does not take desc->lock.  The interrupt handler
    sees a NULL action and oopses.
    
    Only use the percpu chip/handler for per-CPU VIRQs (like VIRQ_TIMER).

    commit a96295965b600f2dc6ad661c4803c86e87db3d7b upstream.
    
    If while setting a block group read-only we end up allocating a system
    chunk, through check_system_chunk(), we were not doing it while holding
    the chunk mutex which is a problem if a concurrent chunk allocation is
    happening, through do_chunk_alloc(), as it means both block groups can
    end up using the same logical addresses and physical regions in the
    device(s). So make sure we hold the chunk mutex.

    Revert "libceph: clear r_req_lru_item in __unregister_linger_request()"
    
    commit 521a04d06a729e5971cdee7f84080387ed320527 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit ba9d114ec5578e6e99a4dfa37ff8ae688040fd64.
    
    .. which introduced a regression that prevented all lingering requests
    requeued in kick_requests() from ever being sent to the OSDs, resulting
    in a lot of missed notifies.  In retrospect it's pretty obvious that
    r_req_lru_item item in the case of lingering requests can be used not
    only for notarget, but also for unsent linkage due to how tightly
    actual map and enqueue operations are coupled in __map_request().
    
    The assertion that was being silenced is taken care of in the previous
    ("libceph: request a new osdmap if lingering request maps to no osd")
    commit: by always kicking homeless lingering requests we ensure that
    none of them ends up on the notarget list outside of the critical
    section guarded by request_mutex.

    libceph: request a new osdmap if lingering request maps to no osd
    
    commit b0494532214bdfbf241e94fabab5dd46f7b82631 upstream.
    
    This commit does two things.  First, if there are any homeless
    lingering requests, we now request a new osdmap even if the osdmap that
    is being processed brought no changes, i.e. if a given lingering
    request turned homeless in one of the previous epochs and remained
    homeless in the current epoch.  Not doing so leaves us with a stale
    osdmap and as a result we may miss our window for reestablishing the
    watch and lose notifies.
    
    MON=1 OSD=1:
    
        # cat linger-needmap.sh
        #!/bin/bash
        rbd create --size 1 test
        DEV=$(rbd map test)
        ceph osd out 0
        rbd map dne/dne # obtain a new osdmap as a side effect (!)
        sleep 1
        ceph osd in 0
        rbd resize --size 2 test
        # rbd info test | grep size -> 2M
        # blockdev --getsize $DEV -> 1M
    
    N.B.: Not obtaining a new osdmap in between "osd out" and "osd in"
    above is enough to make it miss that resize notify, but that is a
    bug^Wlimitation of ceph watch/notify v1.
    
    Second, homeless lingering requests are now kicked just like those
    lingering requests whose mapping has changed.  This is mainly to
    recognize that a homeless lingering request makes no sense and to
    preserve the invariant that a registered lingering request is not
    sitting on any of r_req_lru_item lists.  This spares us a WARN_ON,
    which commit ba9d114ec557 ("libceph: clear r_req_lru_item in
    __unregister_linger_request()") tried to fix the _wrong_ way.

    ovl: mount read-only if workdir can't be created
    
    commit cc6f67bcafcb6bbbb2d1be1603dcd95125a52800 upstream.
    
    OpenWRT folks reported that overlayfs fails to mount if upper fs is full,
    because workdir can't be created.  Wordir creation can fail for various
    other reasons too.
    
    There's no reason that the mount itself should fail, overlayfs can work
    fine without a workdir, as long as the overlay isn't modified.
    
    So mount it read-only and don't allow remounting read-write.
    
    Add a couple of WARN_ON()s for the impossible case of workdir being used
    despite being read-only.

    ovl: don't remove non-empty opaque directory
    
    commit d377c5eb54dd05aeb3094b7740252d19ba7791f7 upstream.
    
    When removing an opaque directory we can't just call rmdir() to check for
    emptiness, because the directory will need to be replaced with a whiteout.
    The replacement is done with RENAME_EXCHANGE, which doesn't check
    emptiness.
    
    Solution is just to check emptiness by reading the directory.  In the
    future we could add a new rename flag to check for emptiness even for
    RENAME_EXCHANGE to optimize this case.

    lguest: fix out-by-one error in address checking.
    
    commit 83a35114d0e4583e6b0ca39502e68b6a92e2910c upstream.
    
    This bug has been there since day 1; addresses in the top guest physical
    page weren't considered valid.  You could map that page (the check in
    check_gpte() is correct), but if a guest tried to put a pagetable there
    we'd check that address manually when walking it, and kill the guest.

    xfs: xfs_attr_inactive leaves inconsistent attr fork state behind
    
    commit 6dfe5a049f2d48582050339d2a6b6fda36dfd14c upstream.
    
    xfs_attr_inactive() is supposed to clean up the attribute fork when
    the inode is being freed. While it removes attribute fork extents,
    it completely ignores attributes in local format, which means that
    there can still be active attributes on the inode after
    xfs_attr_inactive() has run.
    
    This leads to problems with concurrent inode writeback - the in-core
    inode attribute fork is removed without locking on the assumption
    that nothing will be attempting to access the attribute fork after a
    call to xfs_attr_inactive() because it isn't supposed to exist on
    disk any more.
    
    To fix this, make xfs_attr_inactive() completely remove all traces
    of the attribute fork from the inode, regardless of it's state.
    Further, also remove the in-core attribute fork structure safely so
    that there is nothing further that needs to be done by callers to
    clean up the attribute fork. This means we can remove the in-core
    and on-disk attribute forks atomically.
    
    Also, on error simply remove the in-memory attribute fork. There's
    nothing that can be done with it once we have failed to remove the
    on-disk attribute fork, so we may as well just blow it away here
    anyway.

    omfs: fix sign confusion for bitmap loop counter
    
    commit c0345ee57d461343586b5e1e2f9c3c3766d07fe6 upstream.
    
    The count variable is used to iterate down to (below) zero from the size
    of the bitmap and handle the one-filling the remainder of the last
    partial bitmap block.  The loop conditional expects count to be signed
    in order to detect when the final block is processed, after which count
    goes negative.
    
    Unfortunately, a recent change made this unsigned along with some other
    related fields.  The result of is this is that during mount,
    omfs_get_imap will overrun the bitmap array and corrupt memory unless
    number of blocks happens to be a multiple of 8 * blocksize.
    
    Fix by changing count back to signed: it is guaranteed to fit in an s32
    without overflow due to an enforced limit on the number of blocks in the
    filesystem.

    commit dcbff39da3d815f08750552fdd04f96b51751129 upstream.
    
    match_token() expects a NULL terminator at the end of the token list so
    that it would know where to stop.  Not having one causes it to overrun
    to invalid memory.
    
    In practice, passing a mount option that omfs didn't recognize would

    ktime: Fix ktime_divns to do signed division
    
    commit f7bcb70ebae0dcdb5a2d859b09e4465784d99029 upstream.
    
    It was noted that the 32bit implementation of ktime_divns()
    was doing unsigned division and didn't properly handle
    negative values.
    
    And when a ktime helper was changed to utilize
    ktime_divns, it caused a regression on some IR blasters.
    See the following bugzilla for details:
      https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1200353
    
    This patch fixes the problem in ktime_divns by checking
    and preserving the sign bit, and then reapplying it if
    appropriate after the division, it also changes the return
    type to a s64 to make it more obvious this is expected.
    
    Nicolas also pointed out that negative dividers would
    cause infinite loops on 32bit systems, negative dividers
    is unlikely for users of this function, but out of caution
    this patch adds checks for negative dividers for both
    32-bit (BUG_ON) and 64-bit(WARN_ON) versions to make sure
    no such use cases creep in.

    x86/fpu: Disable XSAVES* support for now
    
    commit e88221c50cadade0eb4f7f149f4967d760212695 upstream.
    
    The kernel's handling of 'compacted' xsave state layout is buggy:
    
        http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=142967852317199
    
    I don't have such a system, and the description there is vague, but
    from extrapolation I guess that there were two kinds of bugs
    observed:
    
      - boot crashes, due to size calculations being wrong and the dynamic
        allocation allocating a too small xstate area. (This is now fixed
        in the new FPU code - but still present in stable kernels.)
    
      - FPU state corruption and ABI breakage: if signal handlers try to
        change the FPU state in standard format, which then the kernel
        tries to restore in the compacted format.
    
    These breakages are scary, but they only occur on a small number of
    systems that have XSAVES* CPU support. Yet we have had XSAVES support
    in the upstream kernel for a large number of stable kernel releases,
    and the fixes are involved and unproven.
    
    So do the safe resolution first: disable XSAVES* support and only
    use the standard xstate format. This makes the code work and is
    easy to backport.
    
    On top of this we can work on enabling (and testing!) proper
    compacted format support, without backporting pressure, on top of the
    new, cleaned up FPU code.

    x86/mce: Fix MCE severity messages
    
    commit 17fea54bf0ab34fa09a06bbde2f58ed7bbdf9299 upstream.
    
    Derek noticed that a critical MCE gets reported with the wrong
    error type description:
    
      [Hardware Error]: CPU 34: Machine Check Exception: 5 Bank 9: f200003f000100b0
      [Hardware Error]: RIP !INEXACT! 10:<ffffffff812e14c1> {intel_idle+0xb1/0x170}
      [Hardware Error]: TSC 49587b8e321cb
      [Hardware Error]: PROCESSOR 0:306e4 TIME 1431561296 SOCKET 1 APIC 29
      [Hardware Error]: Some CPUs didn't answer in synchronization
      [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Invalid
                                       ^^^^^^^
    
    The last line with 'Invalid' should have printed the high level
    MCE error type description we get from mce_severity, i.e.
    something like:
    
      [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Action required: data load error in a user process
    
    this happens due to the fact that mce_no_way_out() iterates over
    all MCA banks and possibly overwrites the @msg argument which is
    used in the panic printing later.
    
    Change behavior to take the message of only and the (last)
    critical MCE it detects.

    iommu/arm-smmu: Fix sign-extension of upstream bus addresses at stage 1
    
    commit 5dc5616ee850eaba055bb469a6c4a471d489140e upstream.
    
    Stage 1 translation is controlled by two sets of page tables (TTBR0 and
    TTBR1) which grow up and down from zero respectively in the ARMv8
    translation regime. For the SMMU, we only care about TTBR0 and, in the
    case of a 48-bit virtual space, we expect to map virtual addresses 0x0
    through to 0xffff_ffff_ffff.
    
    Given that some masters may be incapable of emitting virtual addresses
    targetting TTBR1 (e.g. because they sit on a 48-bit bus), the SMMU
    architecture allows bit 47 to be sign-extended, halving the virtual
    range of TTBR0 but allowing TTBR1 to be used. This is controlled by the
    SEP field in TTBCR2.
    
    The SMMU driver incorrectly enables this sign-extension feature, which
    causes problems when userspace addresses are programmed into a master
    device with the SMMU expecting to map the incoming transactions via
    TTBR0; if the top bit of address is set, we will instead get a
    translation fault since TTBR1 walks are disabled in the TTBCR.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by disabling sign-extension of a fixed
    virtual address bit and instead basing the behaviour on the upstream bus
    size: the incoming address is zero extended unless the upstream bus is
    only 49 bits wide, in which case bit 48 is used as the sign bit and is
    replicated to the upper bits.

    iommu/amd: Fix bug in put_pasid_state_wait
    
    commit 1bf1b431d98d7e5b5419876d4c219469e60693e1 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a bug in put_pasid_state_wait that appeared in kernel 4.0
    The bug is that pasid_state->count wasn't decremented before entering the
    wait_event. Thus, the condition in wait_event will never be true.
    
    The fix is to decrement (atomically) the pasid_state->count before the
    wait_event.

    fs_pin: Allow for the possibility that m_list or s_list go unused.
    
    commit 820f9f147dcce2602eefd9b575bbbd9ea14f0953 upstream.
    
    This is needed to support lazily umounting locked mounts.  Because the
    entire unmounted subtree needs to stay together until there are no
    users with references to any part of the subtree.
    
    To support this guarantee that the fs_pin m_list and s_list nodes
    are initialized by initializing them in init_fs_pin allowing
    for the possibility that pin_insert_group does not touch them.
    
    Further use hlist_del_init in pin_remove so that there is
    a hlist_unhashed test before the list we attempt to update
    the previous list item.

    mnt: Fail collect_mounts when applied to unmounted mounts
    
    commit cd4a40174b71acd021877341684d8bb1dc8ea4ae upstream.
    
    The only users of collect_mounts are in audit_tree.c
    
    In audit_trim_trees and audit_add_tree_rule the path passed into
    collect_mounts is generated from kern_path passed an audit_tree
    pathname which is guaranteed to be an absolute path.   In those cases
    collect_mounts is obviously intended to work on mounted paths and
    if a race results in paths that are unmounted when collect_mounts
    it is reasonable to fail early.
    
    The paths passed into audit_tag_tree don't have the absolute path
    check.  But are used to play with fsnotify and otherwise interact with
    the audit_trees, so again operating only on mounted paths appears
    reasonable.
    
    Avoid having to worry about what happens when we try and audit
    unmounted filesystems by restricting collect_mounts to mounts
    that appear in the mount tree.
