    tcp: enforce tcp_min_snd_mss in tcp_mtu_probing()
    
    commit 967c05aee439e6e5d7d805e195b3a20ef5c433d6 upstream.
    
    If mtu probing is enabled tcp_mtu_probing() could very well end up
    with a too small MSS.
    
    Use the new sysctl tcp_min_snd_mss to make sure MSS search
    is performed in an acceptable range.

    tcp: add tcp_min_snd_mss sysctl
    
    commit 5f3e2bf008c2221478101ee72f5cb4654b9fc363 upstream.
    
    Some TCP peers announce a very small MSS option in their SYN and/or
    SYN/ACK messages.
    
    This forces the stack to send packets with a very high network/cpu
    overhead.
    
    Linux has enforced a minimal value of 48. Since this value includes
    the size of TCP options, and that the options can consume up to 40
    bytes, this means that each segment can include only 8 bytes of payload.
    
    In some cases, it can be useful to increase the minimal value
    to a saner value.
    
    We still let the default to 48 (TCP_MIN_SND_MSS), for compatibility
    reasons.
    
    Note that TCP_MAXSEG socket option enforces a minimal value
    of (TCP_MIN_MSS). David Miller increased this minimal value
    in commit c39508d6f118 ("tcp: Make TCP_MAXSEG minimum more correct.")
    from 64 to 88.
    
    We might in the future merge TCP_MIN_SND_MSS and TCP_MIN_MSS.

    tcp: tcp_fragment() should apply sane memory limits
    
    commit f070ef2ac66716357066b683fb0baf55f8191a2e upstream.
    
    Jonathan Looney reported that a malicious peer can force a sender
    to fragment its retransmit queue into tiny skbs, inflating memory
    usage and/or overflow 32bit counters.
    
    TCP allows an application to queue up to sk_sndbuf bytes,
    so we need to give some allowance for non malicious splitting
    of retransmit queue.
    
    A new SNMP counter is added to monitor how many times TCP
    did not allow to split an skb if the allowance was exceeded.
    
    Note that this counter might increase in the case applications
    use SO_SNDBUF socket option to lower sk_sndbuf.
    
    CVE-2019-11478 : tcp_fragment, prevent fragmenting a packet when the
            socket is already using more than half the allowed space

    tcp: limit payload size of sacked skbs
    
    commit 3b4929f65b0d8249f19a50245cd88ed1a2f78cff upstream.
    
    Jonathan Looney reported that TCP can trigger the following crash
    in tcp_shifted_skb() :
    
            BUG_ON(tcp_skb_pcount(skb) < pcount);
    
    This can happen if the remote peer has advertized the smallest
    MSS that linux TCP accepts : 48
    
    An skb can hold 17 fragments, and each fragment can hold 32KB
    on x86, or 64KB on PowerPC.
    
    This means that the 16bit witdh of TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tcp_gso_segs
    can overflow.
    
    Note that tcp_sendmsg() builds skbs with less than 64KB
    of payload, so this problem needs SACK to be enabled.
    SACK blocks allow TCP to coalesce multiple skbs in the retransmit
    queue, thus filling the 17 fragments to maximal capacity.
    
    CVE-2019-11477 -- u16 overflow of TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tcp_gso_segs
    
    Fixes: 832d11c5cd07 ("tcp: Try to restore large SKBs while SACK processing")
