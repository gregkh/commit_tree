    seq_file: disallow extremely large seq buffer allocations
    
    commit 8cae8cd89f05f6de223d63e6d15e31c8ba9cf53b upstream.
    
    There is no reasonable need for a buffer larger than this, and it avoids
    int overflow pitfalls.

    net: bridge: multicast: fix PIM hello router port marking race
    
    commit 04bef83a3358946bfc98a5ecebd1b0003d83d882 upstream.
    
    When a PIM hello packet is received on a bridge port with multicast
    snooping enabled, we mark it as a router port automatically, that
    includes adding that port the router port list. The multicast lock
    protects that list, but it is not acquired in the PIM message case
    leading to a race condition, we need to take it to fix the race.

    MIPS: vdso: Invalid GIC access through VDSO
    
    [ Upstream commit 47ce8527fbba145a7723685bc9a27d9855e06491 ]
    
    Accessing raw timers (currently only CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW) through VDSO
    doesn't return the correct time when using the GIC as clock source.
    The address of the GIC mapped page is in this case not calculated
    correctly. The GIC mapped page is calculated from the VDSO data by
    subtracting PAGE_SIZE:
    
      void *get_gic(const struct vdso_data *data) {
        return (void __iomem *)data - PAGE_SIZE;
      }
    
    However, the data pointer is not page aligned for raw clock sources.
    This is because the VDSO data for raw clock sources (CS_RAW = 1) is
    stored after the VDSO data for coarse clock sources (CS_HRES_COARSE = 0).
    Therefore, only the VDSO data for CS_HRES_COARSE is page aligned:
    
      +--------------------+
      |                    |
      | vd[CS_RAW]         | ---+
      | vd[CS_HRES_COARSE] |    |
      +--------------------+    | -PAGE_SIZE
      |                    |    |
      |  GIC mapped page   | <--+
      |                    |
      +--------------------+
    
    When __arch_get_hw_counter() is called with &vd[CS_RAW], get_gic returns
    the wrong address (somewhere inside the GIC mapped page). The GIC counter
    values are not returned which results in an invalid time.

    mips: always link byteswap helpers into decompressor
    
    [ Upstream commit cddc40f5617e53f97ef019d5b29c1bd6cbb031ec ]
    
    My series to clean up the unaligned access implementation
    across architectures caused some mips randconfig builds to
    fail with:
    
       mips64-linux-ld: arch/mips/boot/compressed/decompress.o: in function `decompress_kernel':
       decompress.c:(.text.decompress_kernel+0x54): undefined reference to `__bswapsi2'
    
    It turns out that this problem has already been fixed for the XZ
    decompressor but now it also shows up in (at least) LZO and LZ4.  From my
    analysis I concluded that the compiler could always have emitted those
    calls, but the different implementation allowed it to make otherwise
    better decisions about not inlining the byteswap, which results in the
    link error when the out-of-line code is missing.
    
    While it could be addressed by adding it to the two decompressor
    implementations that are known to be affected, but as this only adds
    112 bytes to the kernel, the safer choice is to always add them.

    "make dtbs_check" complains:
    
        arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7779-marzen.dt.yaml: display@fff80000: clock-names:0: 'du.0' was expected
    
    Change the first clock name to match the DT bindings.
    This has no effect on actual operation, as the Display Unit driver in
    Linux does not use the first clock name on R-Car H1, but just grabs the
    first clock.

    rtc: fix snprintf() checking in is_rtc_hctosys()
    
    [ Upstream commit 54b909436ede47e0ee07f1765da27ec2efa41e84 ]
    
    The scnprintf() function silently truncates the printf() and returns
    the number bytes that it was able to copy (not counting the NUL
    terminator).  Thus, the highest value it can return here is
    "NAME_SIZE - 1" and the overflow check is dead code.  Fix this by
    using the snprintf() function which returns the number of bytes that
    would have been copied if there was enough space and changing the
    condition from "> NAME_SIZE" to ">= NAME_SIZE".

    [ Upstream commit 5a2f966d0f3fa0ef6dada7ab9eda74cacee96b8a ]
    
    It's unsafe to operate a vq from multiple threads.
    Unfortunately this is exactly what we do when invoking
    clean tx poll from rx napi.
    Same happens with napi-tx even without the
    opportunistic cleaning from the receive interrupt: that races
    with processing the vq in start_xmit.
    
    As a fix move everything that deals with the vq to under tx lock.

    The interrupt affinity scheme used by this driver is incompatible with
    multi-MSI as it implies moving the doorbell address to that of another MSI
    group.  This isn't possible for multi-MSI, as all the MSIs must have the
    same doorbell address. As such it is restricted to systems with a single
    CPU.

    power: supply: rt5033_battery: Fix device tree enumeration
    
    [ Upstream commit f3076cd8d1d5fa64b5e1fa5affc045c2fc123baa ]
    
    The fuel gauge in the RT5033 PMIC has its own I2C bus and interrupt
    line. Therefore, it is not actually part of the RT5033 MFD and needs
    its own of_match_table to probe properly.
    
    Also, given that it's independent of the MFD, there is actually
    no need to make the Kconfig depend on MFD_RT5033. Although the driver
    uses the shared <linux/mfd/rt5033.h> header, there is no compile
    or runtime dependency on the RT5033 MFD driver.

    f2fs: add MODULE_SOFTDEP to ensure crc32 is included in the initramfs
    
    [ Upstream commit 0dd571785d61528d62cdd8aa49d76bc6085152fe ]
    
    As marcosfrm reported in bugzilla:
    
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213089
    
    Initramfs generators rely on "pre" softdeps (and "depends") to include
    additional required modules.
    
    F2FS does not declare "pre: crc32" softdep. Then every generator (dracut,
    mkinitcpio...) has to maintain a hardcoded list for this purpose.
    
    Hence let's use MODULE_SOFTDEP("pre: crc32") in f2fs code.

    [ Upstream commit 86f7fa71cd830d18d7ebcaf719dffd5ddfe1acdd ]
    
    A consumer is expected to disable a PWM before calling pwm_put(). And if
    they didn't there is hopefully a good reason (or the consumer needs
    fixing). Also if disabling an enabled PWM was the right thing to do,
    this should better be done in the framework instead of in each low level
    driver.
    
    So drop the hardware modification from the .remove() callback.

    The warning about the page lock also seems bogus.  The comment over

    x86/fpu: Return proper error codes from user access functions
    
    [ Upstream commit aee8c67a4faa40a8df4e79316dbfc92d123989c1 ]
    
    When *RSTOR from user memory raises an exception, there is no way to
    differentiate them. That's bad because it forces the slow path even when
    the failure was not a fault. If the operation raised eg. #GP then going
    through the slow path is pointless.
    
    Use _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() which stores the trap number and let the exception
    fixup return the negated trap number as error.
    
    This allows to separate the fast path and let it handle faults directly and
    avoid the slow path for all other exceptions.

    watchdog: iTCO_wdt: Account for rebooting on second timeout
    
    [ Upstream commit cb011044e34c293e139570ce5c01aed66a34345c ]
    
    This was already attempted to fix via 1fccb73011ea: If the BIOS did not
    enable TCO SMIs, the timer definitely needs to trigger twice in order to
    cause a reboot. If TCO SMIs are on, as well as SMIs in general, we can
    continue to assume that the BIOS will perform a reboot on the first
    timeout.
    
    QEMU with its ICH9 and related BIOS falls into the former category,
    currently taking twice the configured timeout in order to reboot the
    machine. For iTCO version that fall under turn_SMI_watchdog_clear_off,
    this is also true and was currently only addressed for v1, irrespective
    of the turn_SMI_watchdog_clear_off value.

    [ Upstream commit d0212f095ab56672f6f36aabc605bda205e1e0bf ]
    
    This driver's remove path calls del_timer(). However, that function
    does not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the
    timer handler may still be running after the driver's remove function
    has finished, which would result in a use-after-free.
    
    Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timer handler
    has finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.

    watchdog: sc520_wdt: Fix possible use-after-free in wdt_turnoff()
    
    [ Upstream commit 90b7c141132244e8e49a34a4c1e445cce33e07f4 ]
    
    This module's remove path calls del_timer(). However, that function
    does not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the
    timer handler may still be running after the driver's remove function
    has finished, which would result in a use-after-free.
    
    Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timer handler
    has finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.

    power: supply: max17042: Do not enforce (incorrect) interrupt trigger type
    
    [ Upstream commit 7fbf6b731bca347700e460d94b130f9d734b33e9 ]
    
    Interrupt line can be configured on different hardware in different way,
    even inverted.  Therefore driver should not enforce specific trigger
    type - edge falling - but instead rely on Devicetree to configure it.
    
    The Maxim 17047/77693 datasheets describe the interrupt line as active
    low with a requirement of acknowledge from the CPU therefore the edge
    falling is not correct.
    
    The interrupt line is shared between PMIC and RTC driver, so using level
    sensitive interrupt is here especially important to avoid races.  With
    an edge configuration in case if first PMIC signals interrupt followed
    shortly after by the RTC, the interrupt might not be yet cleared/acked
    thus the second one would not be noticed.

    A consumer is expected to disable a PWM before calling pwm_put(). And if
    they didn't there is hopefully a good reason (or the consumer needs
    fixing). Also if disabling an enabled PWM was the right thing to do,
    this should better be done in the framework instead of in each low level
    driver.
    
    So drop the hardware modification from the .remove() callback.

    lib/decompress_unlz4.c: correctly handle zero-padding around initrds.
    
    [ Upstream commit 2c484419efc09e7234c667aa72698cb79ba8d8ed ]
    
    lz4 compatible decompressor is simple.  The format is underspecified and
    relies on EOF notification to determine when to stop.  Initramfs buffer
    format[1] explicitly states that it can have arbitrary number of zero
    padding.  Thus when operating without a fill function, be extra careful to
    ensure that sizes less than 4, or apperantly empty chunksizes are treated
    as EOF.
    
    To test this I have created two cpio initrds, first a normal one,
    main.cpio.  And second one with just a single /test-file with content
    "second" second.cpio.  Then i compressed both of them with gzip, and with
    lz4 -l.  Then I created a padding of 4 bytes (dd if=/dev/zero of=pad4 bs=1
    count=4).  To create four testcase initrds:
    
     1) main.cpio.gzip + extra.cpio.gzip = pad0.gzip
     2) main.cpio.lz4  + extra.cpio.lz4 = pad0.lz4
     3) main.cpio.gzip + pad4 + extra.cpio.gzip = pad4.gzip
     4) main.cpio.lz4  + pad4 + extra.cpio.lz4 = pad4.lz4
    
    The pad4 test-cases replicate the initrd load by grub, as it pads and
    aligns every initrd it loads.
    
    All of the above boot, however /test-file was not accessible in the initrd
    for the testcase #4, as decoding in lz4 decompressor failed.  Also an
    error message printed which usually is harmless.
    
    Whith a patched kernel, all of the above testcases now pass, and
    /test-file is accessible.
    
    This fixes lz4 initrd decompress warning on every boot with grub.  And
    more importantly this fixes inability to load multiple lz4 compressed
    initrds with grub.  This patch has been shipping in Ubuntu kernels since
    January 2021.

    i2c: core: Disable client irq on reboot/shutdown
    
    [ Upstream commit b64210f2f7c11c757432ba3701d88241b2b98fb1 ]
    
    If an i2c client receives an interrupt during reboot or shutdown it may
    be too late to service it by making an i2c transaction on the bus
    because the i2c controller has already been shutdown. This can lead to
    system hangs if the i2c controller tries to make a transfer that is
    doomed to fail because the access to the i2c pins is already shut down,
    or an iommu translation has been torn down so i2c controller register
    access doesn't work.
    
    Let's simply disable the irq if there isn't a shutdown callback for an
    i2c client when there is an irq associated with the device. This will
    make sure that irqs don't come in later than the time that we can handle
    it. We don't do this if the i2c client device already has a shutdown
    callback because presumably they're doing the right thing and quieting
    the device so irqs don't come in after the shutdown callback returns.

    Some devices don't drain their pipelines if we don't make sure that
    the corresponding output port is in reset before programming it for
    a new trace capture, resulting in bits of old trace appearing in the
    new trace capture. Fix that by explicitly making sure the reset is
    asserted before programming new trace capture.

    A user of FFADO project reported the issue of ToneWeal FW66. As a result,
    the device is identified as one of applications of BeBoB solution.
    
    I note that in the report the device returns contradictory result in plug
    discovery process for audio subunit. Fortunately ALSA BeBoB driver doesn't
    perform it thus it's likely to handle the device without issues.
    
    I receive no reaction to test request for this patch yet, however it would
    be worth to add support for it.

    Inside function hideep_nvm_unlock(), variable "unmask_code" could
    be uninitialized if hideep_pgm_r_reg() returns error, however, it
    is used in the later if statement after an "and" operation, which

    selftests/powerpc: Fix "no_handler" EBB selftest
    
    [ Upstream commit 45677c9aebe926192e59475b35a1ff35ff2d4217 ]
    
    The "no_handler_test" in ebb selftests attempts to read the PMU
    registers twice via helper function "dump_ebb_state". First dump is
    just before closing of event and the second invocation is done after
    closing of the event. The original intention of second
    dump_ebb_state was to dump the state of registers at the end of
    the test when the counters are frozen. But this will be achieved
    with the first call itself since sample period is set to low value
    and PMU will be frozen by then. Hence patch removes the
    dump which was done before closing of the event.

    [ Upstream commit 0d3e5a057992bdc66e4dca2ca50b77fa4a7bd90e ]
    
    This test will require /dev/rtc0, the default RTC device, or one
    specified by user to run. Since this default RTC is not guaranteed to
    exist on all of the devices, so check its existence first, otherwise
    skip this test with the kselftest skip code 4.
    
    Without this patch this test will fail like this on a s390x zVM:
    $ selftests: timers: rtcpie
    $ /dev/rtc0: No such file or directory
    not ok 1 selftests: timers: rtcpie # exit=22
    
    With this patch:
    $ selftests: timers: rtcpie
    $ Default RTC /dev/rtc0 does not exist. Test Skipped!
    not ok 9 selftests: timers: rtcpie # SKIP
    
    Fixed up change log so "With this patch" text doesn't get dropped.

    scsi: iscsi: Fix shost->max_id use
    
    [ Upstream commit bdd4aad7ff92ae39c2e93c415bb6761cb8b584da ]
    
    The iscsi offload drivers are setting the shost->max_id to the max number
    of sessions they support. The problem is that max_id is not the max number
    of targets but the highest identifier the targets can have. To use it to
    limit the number of targets we need to set it to max sessions - 1, or we
    can end up with a session we might not have preallocated resources for.

    scsi: iscsi: Fix conn use after free during resets
    
    [ Upstream commit ec29d0ac29be366450a7faffbcf8cba3a6a3b506 ]
    
    If we haven't done a unbind target call we can race where
    iscsi_conn_teardown wakes up the EH thread and then frees the conn while
    those threads are still accessing the conn ehwait.
    
    We can only do one TMF per session so this just moves the TMF fields from
    the conn to the session. We can then rely on the
    iscsi_session_teardown->iscsi_remove_session->__iscsi_unbind_session call
    to remove the target and it's devices, and know after that point there is
    no device or scsi-ml callout trying to access the session.

    scsi: core: Cap scsi_host cmd_per_lun at can_queue
    
    [ Upstream commit ea2f0f77538c50739b9fb4de4700cee5535e1f77 ]
    
    The sysfs handling function sdev_store_queue_depth() enforces that the sdev
    queue depth cannot exceed shost can_queue. The initial sdev queue depth
    comes from shost cmd_per_lun. However, the LLDD may manually set
    cmd_per_lun to be larger than can_queue, which leads to an initial sdev
    queue depth greater than can_queue.
    
    Such an issue was reported in [0], which caused a hang. That has since been
    fixed in commit fc09acb7de31 ("scsi: scsi_debug: Fix cmd_per_lun, set to
    max_queue").
    
    Stop this possibly happening for other drivers by capping shost cmd_per_lun
    at shost can_queue.

    scsi: lpfc: Fix crash when lpfc_sli4_hba_setup() fails to initialize the SGLs
    
    [ Upstream commit 5aa615d195f1e142c662cb2253f057c9baec7531 ]
    
    The driver is encountering a crash in lpfc_free_iocb_list() while
    performing initial attachment.
    
    Code review found this to be an errant failure path that was taken, jumping
    to a tag that then referenced structures that were uninitialized.
    
    Fix the failure path.

    scsi: lpfc: Fix "Unexpected timeout" error in direct attach topology
    
    [ Upstream commit e30d55137edef47434c40d7570276a0846fe922c ]
    
    An 'unexpected timeout' message may be seen in a point-2-point topology.
    The message occurs when a PLOGI is received before the driver is notified
    of FLOGI completion. The FLOGI completion failure causes discovery to be
    triggered for a second time. The discovery timer is restarted but no new
    discovery activity is initiated, thus the timeout message eventually
    appears.
    
    In point-2-point, when discovery has progressed before the FLOGI completion
    is processed, it is not a failure. Add code to FLOGI completion to detect
    that discovery has progressed and exit the FLOGI handling (noop'ing it).

    I've explained that optional FireWire card for d.2 is also built-in to
    d.2 Pro, however it's wrong. The optional card uses DM1000 ASIC and has
    'Mackie DJ Mixer' in its model name of configuration ROM. On the other
    hand, built-in FireWire card for d.2 Pro and d.4 Pro uses OXFW971 ASIC
    and has 'd.Pro' in its model name according to manuals and user
    experiences. The former card is not the card for d.2 Pro. They are similar
    in appearance but different internally.

    misc/libmasm/module: Fix two use after free in ibmasm_init_one
    
    [ Upstream commit 7272b591c4cb9327c43443f67b8fbae7657dd9ae ]
    
    In ibmasm_init_one, it calls ibmasm_init_remote_input_dev().
    Inside ibmasm_init_remote_input_dev, mouse_dev and keybd_dev are
    allocated by input_allocate_device(), and assigned to
    sp->remote.mouse_dev and sp->remote.keybd_dev respectively.
    
    In the err_free_devices error branch of ibmasm_init_one,
    mouse_dev and keybd_dev are freed by input_free_device(), and return
    error. Then the execution runs into error_send_message error branch
    of ibmasm_init_one, where ibmasm_free_remote_input_dev(sp) is called
    to unregister the freed sp->remote.mouse_dev and sp->remote.keybd_dev.
    
    My patch add a "error_init_remote" label to handle the error of
    ibmasm_init_remote_input_dev(), to avoid the uaf bugs.

    PCI: aardvark: Fix kernel panic during PIO transfer
    
    commit f18139966d072dab8e4398c95ce955a9742e04f7 upstream.
    
    Trying to start a new PIO transfer by writing value 0 in PIO_START register
    when previous transfer has not yet completed (which is indicated by value 1
    in PIO_START) causes an External Abort on CPU, which results in kernel
    panic:
    
        SError Interrupt on CPU0, code 0xbf000002 -- SError
        Kernel panic - not syncing: Asynchronous SError Interrupt
    
    To prevent kernel panic, it is required to reject a new PIO transfer when
    previous one has not finished yet.
    
    If previous PIO transfer is not finished yet, the kernel may issue a new
    PIO request only if the previous PIO transfer timed out.
    
    In the past the root cause of this issue was incorrectly identified (as it
    often happens during link retraining or after link down event) and special
    hack was implemented in Trusted Firmware to catch all SError events in EL3,
    to ignore errors with code 0xbf000002 and not forwarding any other errors
    to kernel and instead throw panic from EL3 Trusted Firmware handler.
    
    Links to discussion and patches about this issue:
    https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/commit/?id=3c7dcdac5c50
    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20190316161243.29517-1-repk@triplefau.lt/
    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/971be151d24312cc533989a64bd454b4@www.loen.fr/
    https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/1541
    
    But the real cause was the fact that during link retraining or after link
    down event the PIO transfer may take longer time, up to the 1.44s until it
    times out. This increased probability that a new PIO transfer would be
    issued by kernel while previous one has not finished yet.
    
    After applying this change into the kernel, it is possible to revert the
    mentioned TF-A hack and SError events do not have to be caught in TF-A EL3.

    commit 7fbcb5da811be7d47468417c7795405058abb3da upstream.
    
    advk_pcie_wait_pio() can be called while holding a spinlock (from
    pci_bus_read_config_dword()), then depends on jiffies in order to
    timeout while polling on PIO state registers. In the case the PIO
    transaction failed, the timeout will never happen and will also cause
    the cpu to stall.
    
    This decrements a variable and wait instead of using jiffies.

    scsi: core: Fix bad pointer dereference when ehandler kthread is invalid
    
    commit 93aa71ad7379900e61c8adff6a710a4c18c7c99b upstream.
    
    Commit 66a834d09293 ("scsi: core: Fix error handling of scsi_host_alloc()")
    changed the allocation logic to call put_device() to perform host cleanup
    with the assumption that IDA removal and stopping the kthread would
    properly be performed in scsi_host_dev_release(). However, in the unlikely
    case that the error handler thread fails to spawn, shost->ehandler is set
    to ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM).
    
    The error handler cleanup code in scsi_host_dev_release() will call
    kthread_stop() if shost->ehandler != NULL which will always be the case
    whether the kthread was successfully spawned or not. In the case that it
    failed to spawn this has the nasty side effect of trying to dereference an
    invalid pointer when kthread_stop() is called. The following splat provides
    an example of this behavior in the wild:
    
    scsi host11: error handler thread failed to spawn, error = -4

    KVM: X86: Disable hardware breakpoints unconditionally before kvm_x86->run()
    
    commit f85d40160691881a17a397c448d799dfc90987ba upstream.
    
    When the host is using debug registers but the guest is not using them
    nor is the guest in guest-debug state, the kvm code does not reset
    the host debug registers before kvm_x86->run().  Rather, it relies on
    the hardware vmentry instruction to automatically reset the dr7 registers
    which ensures that the host breakpoints do not affect the guest.
    
    This however violates the non-instrumentable nature around VM entry
    and exit; for example, when a host breakpoint is set on vcpu->arch.cr2,
    
    Another issue is consistency.  When the guest debug registers are active,
    the host breakpoints are reset before kvm_x86->run(). But when the
    guest debug registers are inactive, the host breakpoints are delayed to
    be disabled.  The host tracing tools may see different results depending
    on what the guest is doing.
    
    To fix the problems, we clear %db7 unconditionally before kvm_x86->run()
    if the host has set any breakpoints, no matter if the guest is using
    them or not.

    media: uvcvideo: Fix pixel format change for Elgato Cam Link 4K
    
    commit 4c6e0976295add7f0ed94d276c04a3d6f1ea8f83 upstream.
    
    The Elgato Cam Link 4K HDMI video capture card reports to support three
    different pixel formats, where the first format depends on the connected
    HDMI device.
    
    ```
    $ v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --list-formats-ext
    ioctl: VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT
            Type: Video Capture
    
            [0]: 'NV12' (Y/CbCr 4:2:0)
                    Size: Discrete 3840x2160
                            Interval: Discrete 0.033s (29.970 fps)
            [1]: 'NV12' (Y/CbCr 4:2:0)
                    Size: Discrete 3840x2160
                            Interval: Discrete 0.033s (29.970 fps)
            [2]: 'YU12' (Planar YUV 4:2:0)
                    Size: Discrete 3840x2160
                            Interval: Discrete 0.033s (29.970 fps)
    ```
    
    Changing the pixel format to anything besides the first pixel format
    does not work:
    
    ```
    $ v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --try-fmt-video pixelformat=YU12
    Format Video Capture:
            Width/Height      : 3840/2160
            Pixel Format      : 'NV12' (Y/CbCr 4:2:0)
            Field             : None
            Bytes per Line    : 3840
            Size Image        : 12441600
            Colorspace        : sRGB
            Transfer Function : Rec. 709
            YCbCr/HSV Encoding: Rec. 709
            Quantization      : Default (maps to Limited Range)
            Flags             :
    ```
    
    User space applications like VLC might show an error message on the
    terminal in that case:
    
    ```
    libv4l2: error set_fmt gave us a different result than try_fmt!
    ```
    
    Depending on the error handling of the user space applications, they
    might display a distorted video, because they use the wrong pixel format
    for decoding the stream.
    
    The Elgato Cam Link 4K responds to the USB video probe
    VS_PROBE_CONTROL/VS_COMMIT_CONTROL with a malformed data structure: The
    second byte contains bFormatIndex (instead of being the second byte of
    bmHint). The first byte is always zero. The third byte is always 1.
    
    The firmware bug was reported to Elgato on 2020-12-01 and it was
    forwarded by the support team to the developers as feature request.
    There is no firmware update available since then. The latest firmware
    for Elgato Cam Link 4K as of 2021-03-23 has MCU 20.02.19 and FPGA 67.
    
    Therefore correct the malformed data structure for this device. The
    change was successfully tested with VLC, OBS, and Chromium using
    different pixel formats (YUYV, NV12, YU12), resolutions (3840x2160,
    1920x1080), and frame rates (29.970 and 59.940 fps).

    media: gspca/sunplus: fix zero-length control requests
    
    commit b4bb4d425b7b02424afea2dfdcd77b3b4794175e upstream.
    
    The direction of the pipe argument must match the request-type direction
    bit or control requests may fail depending on the host-controller-driver
    implementation.
    
    Control transfers without a data stage are treated as OUT requests by
    the USB stack and should be using usb_sndctrlpipe(). Failing to do so
    will now trigger a warning.
    
    Fix the single zero-length control request which was using the
    read-register helper, and update the helper so that zero-length reads
    fail with an error message instead.

    media: subdev: disallow ioctl for saa6588/davinci
    
    commit 0a7790be182d32b9b332a37cb4206e24fe94b728 upstream.
    
    The saa6588_ioctl() function expects to get called from other kernel
    functions with a 'saa6588_command' pointer, but I found nothing stops it
    from getting called from user space instead, which seems rather dangerous.
    
    The same thing happens in the davinci vpbe driver with its VENC_GET_FLD
    command.
    
    As a quick fix, add a separate .command() callback pointer for this
    driver and change the two callers over to that.  This change can easily
    get backported to stable kernels if necessary, but since there are only
    two drivers, we may want to eventually replace this with a set of more
    specialized callbacks in the long run.

    PCI: Leave Apple Thunderbolt controllers on for s2idle or standby
    
    commit 4694ae373dc2114f9a82f6ae15737e65af0c6dea upstream.
    
    On Macbook 2013, resuming from suspend-to-idle or standby resulted in the
    external monitor no longer being detected, a stacktrace, and errors like
    this in dmesg:
    
      pcieport 0000:06:00.0: can't change power state from D3hot to D0 (config space inaccessible)
    
    The reason is that we know how to turn power to the Thunderbolt controller
    *off* via the SXIO/SXFP/SXLF methods, but we don't know how to turn power
    back on.  We have to rely on firmware to turn the power back on.
    
    When going to the "suspend-to-idle" or "standby" system sleep states,
    firmware is not involved either on the suspend side or the resume side, so
    we can't use SXIO/SXFP/SXLF to turn the power off.
    
    Skip SXIO/SXFP/SXLF when firmware isn't involved in suspend, e.g., when
    we're going to the "suspend-to-idle" or "standby" system sleep states.

    dm btree remove: assign new_root only when removal succeeds
    
    commit b6e58b5466b2959f83034bead2e2e1395cca8aeb upstream.
    
    remove_raw() in dm_btree_remove() may fail due to IO read error
    (e.g. read the content of origin block fails during shadowing),
    and the value of shadow_spine::root is uninitialized, but
    the uninitialized value is still assign to new_root in the
    end of dm_btree_remove().
    
    For dm-thin, the value of pmd->details_root or pmd->root will become
    an uninitialized value, so if trying to read details_info tree again
    out-of-bound memory may occur as showed below:

    ipack/carriers/tpci200: Fix a double free in tpci200_pci_probe

    In the out_err_bus_register error branch of tpci200_pci_probe,

    tpci200_unregister()->pci_iounmap(..,tpci200->info->cfg_regs)
    in the first time.
    
    But later, iounmap() is called to free tpci200->info->cfg_regs
    again.
    
    My patch sets tpci200->info->cfg_regs to NULL after tpci200_uninstall()
    to avoid the double free.

    tracing: Resize tgid_map to pid_max, not PID_MAX_DEFAULT
    
    commit 4030a6e6a6a4a42ff8c18414c9e0c93e24cc70b8 upstream.
    
    Currently tgid_map is sized at PID_MAX_DEFAULT entries, which means that
    on systems where pid_max is configured higher than PID_MAX_DEFAULT the
    ftrace record-tgid option doesn't work so well. Any tasks with PIDs
    higher than PID_MAX_DEFAULT are simply not recorded in tgid_map, and
    don't show up in the saved_tgids file.
    
    In particular since systemd v243 & above configure pid_max to its
    highest possible 1<<22 value by default on 64 bit systems this renders
    the record-tgids option of little use.
    
    Increase the size of tgid_map to the configured pid_max instead,
    allowing it to cover the full range of PIDs up to the maximum value of
    PID_MAX_LIMIT if the system is configured that way.
    
    On 64 bit systems with pid_max == PID_MAX_LIMIT this will increase the
    size of tgid_map from 256KiB to 16MiB. Whilst this 64x increase in
    memory overhead sounds significant 64 bit systems are presumably best
    placed to accommodate it, and since tgid_map is only allocated when the
    record-tgid option is actually used presumably the user would rather it
    spends sufficient memory to actually record the tgids they expect.
    
    The size of tgid_map could also increase for CONFIG_BASE_SMALL=y
    configurations, but these seem unlikely to be systems upon which people
    are both configuring a large pid_max and running ftrace with record-tgid
    anyway.
    
    Of note is that we only allocate tgid_map once, the first time that the
    record-tgid option is enabled. Therefore its size is only set once, to
    the value of pid_max at the time the record-tgid option is first
    enabled. If a user increases pid_max after that point, the saved_tgids
    file will not contain entries for any tasks with pids beyond the earlier
    value of pid_max.

    tracing: Simplify & fix saved_tgids logic
    
    commit b81b3e959adb107cd5b36c7dc5ba1364bbd31eb2 upstream.
    
    The tgid_map array records a mapping from pid to tgid, where the index
    of an entry within the array is the pid & the value stored at that index
    is the tgid.
    
    The saved_tgids_next() function iterates over pointers into the tgid_map
    array & dereferences the pointers which results in the tgid, but then it
    passes that dereferenced value to trace_find_tgid() which treats it as a
    pid & does a further lookup within the tgid_map array. It seems likely
    that the intent here was to skip over entries in tgid_map for which the
    recorded tgid is zero, but instead we end up skipping over entries for
    which the thread group leader hasn't yet had its own tgid recorded in
    tgid_map.
    
    A minimal fix would be to remove the call to trace_find_tgid, turning:
    
      if (trace_find_tgid(*ptr))
    
    into:
    
      if (*ptr)
    
    ..but it seems like this logic can be much simpler if we simply let
    seq_read() iterate over the whole tgid_map array & filter out empty
    entries by returning SEQ_SKIP from saved_tgids_show(). Here we take that
    approach, removing the incorrect logic here entirely.

    There's two variables being increased in that loop (i and j), and i
    follows the raw data, and j follows what is being written into the buffer.
    We should compare 'i' to MAX_MEMHEX_BYTES or compare 'j' to HEX_CHARS.
    Otherwise, if 'j' goes bigger than HEX_CHARS, it will overflow the

    ipmi/watchdog: Stop watchdog timer when the current action is 'none'
    
    commit 2253042d86f57d90a621ac2513a7a7a13afcf809 upstream.
    
    When an IPMI watchdog timer is being stopped in ipmi_close() or
    ipmi_ioctl(WDIOS_DISABLECARD), the current watchdog action is updated to
    WDOG_TIMEOUT_NONE and _ipmi_set_timeout(IPMI_SET_TIMEOUT_NO_HB) is called
    to install this action. The latter function ends up invoking
    __ipmi_set_timeout() which makes the actual 'Set Watchdog Timer' IPMI
    request.
    
    For IPMI 1.0, this operation results in fully stopping the watchdog timer.
    For IPMI >= 1.5, function __ipmi_set_timeout() always specifies the "don't
    stop" flag in the prepared 'Set Watchdog Timer' IPMI request. This causes
    that the watchdog timer has its action correctly updated to 'none' but the
    timer continues to run. A problem is that IPMI firmware can then still log
    an expiration event when the configured timeout is reached, which is
    unexpected because the watchdog timer was requested to be stopped.
    
    The patch fixes this problem by not setting the "don't stop" flag in
    __ipmi_set_timeout() when the current action is WDOG_TIMEOUT_NONE which
    results in stopping the watchdog timer. This makes the behaviour for
    IPMI >= 1.5 consistent with IPMI 1.0. It also matches the logic in
    __ipmi_heartbeat() which does not allow to reset the watchdog if the
    current action is WDOG_TIMEOUT_NONE as that would start the timer.

    qemu_fw_cfg: Make fw_cfg_rev_attr a proper kobj_attribute
    
    commit fca41af18e10318e4de090db47d9fa7169e1bf2f upstream.
    
    fw_cfg_showrev() is called by an indirect call in kobj_attr_show(),
    which violates clang's CFI checking because fw_cfg_showrev()'s second
    parameter is 'struct attribute', whereas the ->show() member of 'struct

    ASoC: tegra: Set driver_name=tegra for all machine drivers
    
    commit f6eb84fa596abf28959fc7e0b626f925eb1196c7 upstream.
    
    The driver_name="tegra" is now required by the newer ALSA UCMs, otherwise
    Tegra UCMs don't match by the path/name.
    
    All Tegra machine drivers are specifying the card's name, but it has no
    effect if model name is specified in the device-tree since it overrides
    the card's name. We need to set the driver_name to "tegra" in order to
    get a usable lookup path for the updated ALSA UCMs. The new UCM lookup
    path has a form of driver_name/card_name.
    
    The old lookup paths that are based on driver module name continue to
    work as before. Note that UCM matching never worked for Tegra ASoC drivers
    if they were compiled as built-in, this is fixed by supporting the new
    naming scheme.

    clocksource/arm_arch_timer: Improve Allwinner A64 timer workaround
    
    commit 8b33dfe0ba1c84c1aab2456590b38195837f1e6e upstream.
    
    Bad counter reads are experienced sometimes when bit 10 or greater rolls
    over. Originally, testing showed that at least 10 lower bits would be
    set to the same value during these bad reads. However, some users still
    reported time skips.
    
    Wider testing revealed that on some chips, occasionally only the lowest
    9 bits would read as the anomalous value. During these reads (which
    still happen only when bit 10), bit 9 would read as the correct value.
    
    Reduce the mask by one bit to cover these cases as well.

    cpu/hotplug: Cure the cpusets trainwreck
    
    commit b22afcdf04c96ca58327784e280e10288cfd3303 upstream.
    
    Alexey and Joshua tried to solve a cpusets related hotplug problem which is
    user space visible and results in unexpected behaviour for some time after
    a CPU has been plugged in and the corresponding uevent was delivered.
    
    cpusets delegate the hotplug work (rebuilding cpumasks etc.) to a
    workqueue. This is done because the cpusets code has already a lock
    nesting of cgroups_mutex -> cpu_hotplug_lock. A synchronous callback or
    waiting for the work to finish with cpu_hotplug_lock held can and will
    deadlock because that results in the reverse lock order.
    
    As a consequence the uevent can be delivered before cpusets have consistent
    state which means that a user space invocation of sched_setaffinity() to
    move a task to the plugged CPU fails up to the point where the scheduled
    work has been processed.
    
    The same is true for CPU unplug, but that does not create user observable
    failure (yet).
    
    It's still inconsistent to claim that an operation is finished before it
    actually is and that's the real issue at hand. uevents just make it
    reliably observable.
    
    Obviously the problem should be fixed in cpusets/cgroups, but untangling
    that is pretty much impossible because according to the changelog of the
    commit which introduced this 8 years ago:
    
     3a5a6d0c2b03("cpuset: don't nest cgroup_mutex inside get_online_cpus()")
    
    the lock order cgroups_mutex -> cpu_hotplug_lock is a design decision and
    the whole code is built around that.
    
    So bite the bullet and invoke the relevant cpuset function, which waits for
    the work to finish, in _cpu_up/down() after dropping cpu_hotplug_lock and
    only when tasks are not frozen by suspend/hibernate because that would
    obviously wait forever.
    
    Waiting there with cpu_add_remove_lock, which is protecting the present
    and possible CPU maps, held is not a problem at all because neither work
    queues nor cpusets/cgroups have any lockchains related to that lock.
    
    Waiting in the hotplug machinery is not problematic either because there
    are already state callbacks which wait for hardware queues to drain. It
    makes the operations slightly slower, but hotplug is slow anyway.
    
    This ensures that state is consistent before returning from a hotplug
    up/down operation. It's still inconsistent during the operation, but that's
    a different story.
    
    Add a large comment which explains why this is done and why this is not a
    dump ground for the hack of the day to work around half thought out locking
    schemes. Document also the implications vs. hotplug operations and
    serialization or the lack of it.
    
    Thanks to Alexy and Joshua for analyzing why this temporary
    sched_setaffinity() failure happened.

    ata: ahci_sunxi: Disable DIPM
    
    commit f6bca4d91b2ea052e917cca3f9d866b5cc1d500a upstream.
    
    DIPM is unsupported or broken on sunxi. Trying to enable the power
    management policy med_power_with_dipm on an Allwinner A20 SoC based board
    leads to immediate I/O errors and the attached SATA disk disappears from
    the /dev filesystem. A reset (power cycle) is required to make the SATA
    controller or disk work again. The A10 and A20 SoC data sheets and manuals
    don't mention DIPM at all [1], so it's fair to assume that it's simply not
    supported. But even if it was, it should be considered broken and best be
    disabled in the ahci_sunxi driver.

    mmc: core: Allow UHS-I voltage switch for SDSC cards if supported
    
    commit 09247e110b2efce3a104e57e887c373e0a57a412 upstream.
    
    While initializing an UHS-I SD card, the mmc core first tries to switch to
    1.8V I/O voltage, before it continues to change the settings for the bus
    speed mode.
    
    However, the current behaviour in the mmc core is inconsistent and doesn't
    conform to the SD spec. More precisely, an SD card that supports UHS-I must
    set both the SD_OCR_CCS bit and the SD_OCR_S18R bit in the OCR register
    response. When switching to 1.8V I/O the mmc core correctly checks both of
    the bits, but only the SD_OCR_S18R bit when changing the settings for bus
    speed mode.
    
    Rather than actually fixing the code to confirm to the SD spec, let's
    deliberately deviate from it by requiring only the SD_OCR_S18R bit for both
    parts. This enables us to support UHS-I for SDSC cards (outside spec),
    which is actually being supported by some existing SDSC cards. Moreover,
    this fixes the inconsistent behaviour.

    mmc: core: clear flags before allowing to retune
    
    commit 77347eda64ed5c9383961d1de9165f9d0b7d8df6 upstream.
    
    It might be that something goes wrong during tuning so the MMC core will
    immediately trigger a retune. In our case it was:
    
     - we sent a tuning block
     - there was an error so we need to send an abort cmd to the eMMC
     - the abort cmd had a CRC error
     - retune was set by the MMC core
    
    This lead to a vicious circle causing a performance regression of 75%.
    So, clear retuning flags before we enable retuning to start with a known
    cleared state.

    mmc: sdhci: Fix warning message when accessing RPMB in HS400 mode
    
    commit d0244847f9fc5e20df8b7483c8a4717fe0432d38 upstream.
    
    When an eMMC device is being run in HS400 mode, any access to the
    RPMB device will cause the error message "mmc1: Invalid UHS-I mode
    selected". This happens as a result of tuning being disabled before
    RPMB access and then re-enabled after the RPMB access is complete.
    When tuning is re-enabled, the system has to switch from HS400
    to HS200 to do the tuning and then back to HS400. As part of
    sequence to switch from HS400 to HS200 the system is temporarily
    put into HS mode. When switching to HS mode, sdhci_get_preset_value()
    is called and does not have support for HS mode and prints the warning
    message and returns the preset for SDR12. The fix is to add support
    for MMC and SD HS modes to sdhci_get_preset_value().
    
    This can be reproduced on any system running eMMC in HS400 mode
    (not HS400ES) by using the "mmc" utility to run the following
    command: "mmc rpmb read-counter /dev/mmcblk0rpmb".

    usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix setting of device and driver data cross-references
    
    commit ecfbd7b9054bddb12cea07fda41bb3a79a7b0149 upstream.
    
    FunctionFS device structure 'struct ffs_dev' and driver data structure
    'struct ffs_data' are bound to each other with cross-reference pointers
    'ffs_data->private_data' and 'ffs_dev->ffs_data'. While the first one
    is supposed to be valid through the whole life of 'struct ffs_data'
    (and while 'struct ffs_dev' exists non-freed), the second one is cleared
    in 'ffs_closed()' (called from 'ffs_data_reset()' or the last
    'ffs_data_put()'). This can be called several times, alternating in
    different order with 'ffs_free_inst()', that, if possible, clears
    the other cross-reference.
    
    As a result, different cases of these calls order may leave stale
    cross-reference pointers, used when the pointed structure is already
    freed. Even if it occasionally doesn't cause kernel crash, this error
    is reported by KASAN-enabled kernel configuration.
    
    For example, the case [last 'ffs_data_put()' - 'ffs_free_inst()'] was
    fixed by commit cdafb6d8b8da ("usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix use-after-free in
    ffs_free_inst").
    
    The other case ['ffs_data_reset()' - 'ffs_free_inst()' - 'ffs_data_put()']
    now causes KASAN reported error [1], when 'ffs_data_reset()' clears
    'ffs_dev->ffs_data', then 'ffs_free_inst()' frees the 'struct ffs_dev',
    but can't clear 'ffs_data->private_data', which is then accessed
    in 'ffs_closed()' called from 'ffs_data_put()'. This happens since
    'ffs_dev->ffs_data' reference is cleared too early.
    
    Moreover, one more use case, when 'ffs_free_inst()' is called immediately
    after mounting FunctionFS device (that is before the descriptors are
    written and 'ffs_ready()' is called), and then 'ffs_data_reset()'
    or 'ffs_data_put()' is called from accessing "ep0" file or unmounting
    the device. This causes KASAN error report like [2], since
    'ffs_dev->ffs_data' is not yet set when 'ffs_free_inst()' can't properly
    clear 'ffs_data->private_data', that is later accessed to freed structure.
    
    Fix these (and may be other) cases of stale pointers access by moving
    setting and clearing of the mentioned cross-references to the single
    places, setting both of them when 'struct ffs_data' is created and
    bound to 'struct ffs_dev', and clearing both of them when one of the
    structures is destroyed. It seems convenient to make this pointer
    initialization and structures binding in 'ffs_acquire_dev()' and
    make pointers clearing in 'ffs_release_dev()'. This required some
    changes in these functions parameters and return types.
    
    Also, 'ffs_release_dev()' calling requires some cleanup, fixing minor
    issues, like (1) 'ffs_release_dev()' is not called if 'ffs_free_inst()'
    is called without unmounting the device, and "release_dev" callback
    is not called at all, or (2) "release_dev" callback is called before
    "ffs_closed" callback on unmounting, which seems to be not correctly
    nested with "acquire_dev" and "ffs_ready" callbacks.
    Make this cleanup togther with other mentioned 'ffs_release_dev()' changes.

    powerpc/barrier: Avoid collision with clang's __lwsync macro
    
    commit 015d98149b326e0f1f02e44413112ca8b4330543 upstream.
    
    A change in clang 13 results in the __lwsync macro being defined as
    __builtin_ppc_lwsync, which emits 'lwsync' or 'msync' depending on what
    the target supports. This breaks the build because of -Werror in
    arch/powerpc, along with thousands of warnings:

     1 error generated.
    
    Undefine this macro so that the runtime patching introduced by
    commit 2d1b2027626d ("powerpc: Fixup lwsync at runtime") continues to
    work properly with clang and the build no longer breaks.

    bdi: Do not use freezable workqueue
    
    commit a2b90f11217790ec0964ba9c93a4abb369758c26 upstream.
    
    A removable block device, such as NVMe or SSD connected over Thunderbolt
    can be hot-removed any time including when the system is suspended. When
    device is hot-removed during suspend and the system gets resumed, kernel
    first resumes devices and then thaws the userspace including freezable
    workqueues. What happens in that case is that the NVMe driver notices
    that the device is unplugged and removes it from the system. This ends
    up calling bdi_unregister() for the gendisk which then schedules
    wb_workfn() to be run one more time.
    
    However, since the bdi_wq is still frozen flush_delayed_work() call in
    wb_shutdown() blocks forever halting system resume process. User sees
    this as hang as nothing is happening anymore.
    
    Triggering sysrq-w reveals this:
    
      Workqueue: nvme-wq nvme_remove_dead_ctrl_work [nvme]

    fscrypt: don't ignore minor_hash when hash is 0
    
    commit 77f30bfcfcf484da7208affd6a9e63406420bf91 upstream.
    
    When initializing a no-key name, fscrypt_fname_disk_to_usr() sets the
    minor_hash to 0 if the (major) hash is 0.
    
    This doesn't make sense because 0 is a valid hash code, so we shouldn't
    ignore the filesystem-provided minor_hash in that case.  Fix this by
    removing the special case for 'hash == 0'.
    
    This is an old bug that appears to have originated when the encryption
    code in ext4 and f2fs was moved into fs/crypto/.  The original ext4 and
    f2fs code passed the hash by pointer instead of by value.  So
    'if (hash)' actually made sense then, as it was checking whether a
    pointer was NULL.  But now the hashes are passed by value, and
    filesystems just pass 0 for any hashes they don't have.  There is no
    need to handle this any differently from the hashes actually being 0.
    
    It is difficult to reproduce this bug, as it only made a difference in
    the case where a filename's 32-bit major hash happened to be 0.
    However, it probably had the largest chance of causing problems on
    ubifs, since ubifs uses minor_hash to do lookups of no-key names, in
    addition to using it as a readdir cookie.  ext4 only uses minor_hash as
    a readdir cookie, and f2fs doesn't use minor_hash at all.

    Clang's integrated assembler only accepts these instructions when the
    cpu is set to mips32r5. With this change, we can assemble
    malta_defconfig with Clang via `make LLVM_IAS=1`.

    sctp: add size validation when walking chunks
    
    [ Upstream commit 50619dbf8db77e98d821d615af4f634d08e22698 ]
    
    The first chunk in a packet is ensured to be present at the beginning of
    sctp_rcv(), as a packet needs to have at least 1 chunk. But the second
    one, may not be completely available and ch->length can be over
    uninitialized memory.
    
    Fix here is by only trying to walk on the next chunk if there is enough to
    hold at least the header, and then proceed with the ch->length validation
    that is already there.

    sctp: validate from_addr_param return
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c5dc070ff3d6246d22ddd931f23a6266249e3db ]
    
    Ilja reported that, simply putting it, nothing was validating that
    from_addr_param functions were operating on initialized memory. That is,
    the parameter itself was being validated by sctp_walk_params, but it
    doesn't check for types and their specific sizes and it could be a 0-length
    one, causing from_addr_param to potentially work over the next parameter or
    even uninitialized memory.
    
    The fix here is to, in all calls to from_addr_param, check if enough space
    is there for the wanted IP address type.

    net: ip: avoid OOM kills with large UDP sends over loopback
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d123b81ac615072a8525c13c6c41b695270a15d ]
    
    Dave observed number of machines hitting OOM on the UDP send
    path. The workload seems to be sending large UDP packets over
    loopback. Since loopback has MTU of 64k kernel will try to
    allocate an skb with up to 64k of head space. This has a good
    chance of failing under memory pressure. What's worse if
    the message length is <32k the allocation may trigger an
    OOM killer.
    
    This is entirely avoidable, we can use an skb with page frags.
    
    af_unix solves a similar problem by limiting the head
    length to SKB_MAX_ALLOC. This seems like a good and simple
    approach. It means that UDP messages > 16kB will now
    use fragments if underlying device supports SG, if extra
    allocator pressure causes regressions in real workloads
    we can switch to trying the large allocation first and
    falling back.
    
    v4: pre-calculate all the additions to alloclen so
        we can be sure it won't go over order-2

    media, bpf: Do not copy more entries than user space requested
    
    [ Upstream commit 647d446d66e493d23ca1047fa8492b0269674530 ]
    
    The syscall bpf(BPF_PROG_QUERY, &attr) should use the prog_cnt field to
    see how many entries user space provided and return ENOSPC if there are
    more programs than that. Before this patch, this is not checked and
    ENOSPC is never returned.
    
    Note that one lirc device is limited to 64 bpf programs, and user space
    I'm aware of -- ir-keytable -- always gives enough space for 64 entries
    already. However, we should not copy program ids than are requested.

    wireless: wext-spy: Fix out-of-bounds warning
    
    [ Upstream commit e93bdd78406da9ed01554c51e38b2a02c8ef8025 ]
    
    Fix the following out-of-bounds warning:
    
    net/wireless/wext-spy.c:178:2: warning: 'memcpy' offset [25, 28] from the object at 'threshold' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'low' with type 'struct iw_quality' at offset 20 [-Warray-bounds]
    
    The problem is that the original code is trying to copy data into a
    couple of struct members adjacent to each other in a single call to
    memcpy(). This causes a legitimate compiler warning because memcpy()
    overruns the length of &threshold.low and &spydata->spy_thr_low. As
    these are just a couple of struct members, fix this by using direct
    assignments, instead of memcpy().
    
    This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
    and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
    on memcpy().

    sfc: error code if SRIOV cannot be disabled
    
    [ Upstream commit 1ebe4feb8b442884f5a28d2437040096723dd1ea ]
    
    If SRIOV cannot be disabled during device removal or module unloading,
    return error code so it can be logged properly in the calling function.
    
    Note that this can only happen if any VF is currently attached to a
    guest using Xen, but not with vfio/KVM. Despite that in that case the
    VFs won't work properly with PF removed and/or the module unloaded, I
    have let it as is because I don't know what side effects may have
    changing it, and also it seems to be the same that other drivers are
    doing in this situation.
    
    In the case of being called during SRIOV reconfiguration, the behavior
    hasn't changed because the function is called with force=false.

    sfc: avoid double pci_remove of VFs
    
    [ Upstream commit 45423cff1db66cf0993e8a9bd0ac93e740149e49 ]
    
    If pci_remove was called for a PF with VFs, the removal of the VFs was
    called twice from efx_ef10_sriov_fini: one directly with pci_driver->remove
    and another implicit by calling pci_disable_sriov, which also perform
    the VFs remove. This was leading to crashing the kernel on the second
    attempt.
    
    Given that pci_disable_sriov already calls to pci remove function, get
    rid of the direct call to pci_driver->remove from the driver.
    
    2 different ways to trigger the bug:
    - Create one or more VFs, then attach the PF to a virtual machine (at
      least with qemu/KVM)
    - Create one or more VFs, then remove the PF with:
      echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/PF_PCI_ID/remove
    
    Removing sfc module does not trigger the error, at least for me, because
    it removes the VF first, and then the PF.
    
    Example of a log with the error:
        list_del corruption, ffff967fd20a8ad0->next is LIST_POISON1 (dead000000000100)

    iwlwifi: pcie: free IML DMA memory allocation
    
    [ Upstream commit 310f60f53a86eba680d9bc20a371e13b06a5f903 ]
    
    In the case of gen3 devices with image loader (IML) support,
    we were leaking the IML DMA allocation and never freeing it.
    Fix that.

    iwlwifi: mvm: don't change band on bound PHY contexts
    
    [ Upstream commit 8835a64f74c46baebfc946cd5a2c861b866ebcee ]
    
    When we have a P2P Device active, we attempt to only change the
    PHY context it uses when we get a new remain-on-channel, if the
    P2P Device is the only user of the PHY context.
    
    This is fine if we're switching within a band, but if we're
    switching bands then the switch implies a removal and re-add
    of the PHY context, which isn't permitted by the firmware while
    it's bound to an interface.
    
    Fix the code to skip the unbind/release/... cycle only if the
    band doesn't change (or we have old devices that can switch the
    band on the fly as well.)

    RDMA/rxe: Don't overwrite errno from ib_umem_get()
    
    [ Upstream commit 20ec0a6d6016aa28b9b3299be18baef1a0f91cd2 ]
    
    rxe_mr_init_user() always returns the fixed -EINVAL when ib_umem_get()
    fails so it's hard for user to know which actual error happens in
    ib_umem_get(). For example, ib_umem_get() will return -EOPNOTSUPP when
    trying to pin pages on a DAX file.
    
    Return actual error as mlx4/mlx5 does.

    vsock: notify server to shutdown when client has pending signal
    
    [ Upstream commit c7ff9cff70601ea19245d997bb977344663434c7 ]
    
    The client's sk_state will be set to TCP_ESTABLISHED if the server
    replay the client's connect request.
    
    However, if the client has pending signal, its sk_state will be set
    to TCP_CLOSE without notify the server, so the server will hold the
    corrupt connection.
    
                client                        server
    
    1. sk_state=TCP_SYN_SENT         |
    2. call ->connect()              |
    3. wait reply                    |
                                     | 4. sk_state=TCP_ESTABLISHED
                                     | 5. insert to connected list
                                     | 6. reply to the client
    7. sk_state=TCP_ESTABLISHED      |
    8. insert to connected list      |
    9. *signal pending* <--------------------- the user kill client
    10. sk_state=TCP_CLOSE           |
    client is exiting...             |
    11. call ->release()             |
         virtio_transport_close
          if (!(sk->sk_state == TCP_ESTABLISHED ||
                  sk->sk_state == TCP_CLOSING))
                    return true; *return at here, the server cannot notice the connection is corrupt*
    
    So the client should notify the peer in this case.

    atm: nicstar: register the interrupt handler in the right place
    
    [ Upstream commit 70b639dc41ad499384e41e106fce72e36805c9f2 ]
    
    Because the error handling is sequential, the application of resources
    should be carried out in the order of error handling, so the operation
    of registering the interrupt handler should be put in front, so as not
    to free the unregistered interrupt handler during error handling.

    atm: nicstar: use 'dma_free_coherent' instead of 'kfree'
    
    [ Upstream commit 6a1e5a4af17e440dd82a58a2c5f40ff17a82b722 ]
    
    When 'nicstar_init_one' fails, 'ns_init_card_error' will be executed for
    error handling, but the correct memory free function should be used,
    otherwise it will cause an error. Since 'card->rsq.org' and
    'card->tsq.org' are allocated using 'dma_alloc_coherent' function, they
    should be freed using 'dma_free_coherent'.
    
    Fix this by using 'dma_free_coherent' instead of 'kfree'
    
    This log reveals it:

    MIPS: add PMD table accounting into MIPS'pmd_alloc_one
    
    [ Upstream commit ed914d48b6a1040d1039d371b56273d422c0081e ]
    
    This fixes Page Table accounting bug.
    
    MIPS is the ONLY arch just defining __HAVE_ARCH_PMD_ALLOC_ONE alone.
    Since commit b2b29d6d011944 (mm: account PMD tables like PTE tables),
    "pmd_free" in asm-generic with PMD table accounting and "pmd_alloc_one"
    in MIPS without PMD table accounting causes PageTable accounting number
    negative, which read by global_zone_page_state(), always returns 0.

    wlcore/wl12xx: Fix wl12xx get_mac error if device is in ELP
    
    [ Upstream commit 11ef6bc846dcdce838f0b00c5f6a562c57e5d43b ]
    
    At least on wl12xx, reading the MAC after boot can fail with a warning
    at drivers/net/wireless/ti/wlcore/sdio.c:78 wl12xx_sdio_raw_read.
    The failed call comes from wl12xx_get_mac() that wlcore_nvs_cb() calls
    after request_firmware_work_func().
    
    After the error, no wireless interface is created. Reloading the wl12xx
    module makes the interface work.
    
    Turns out the wlan controller can be in a low-power ELP state after the
    boot from the bootloader or kexec, and needs to be woken up first.
    
    Let's wake the hardware and add a sleep after that similar to
    wl12xx_pre_boot() is already doing.
    
    Note that a similar issue could exist for wl18xx, but I have not seen it
    so far. And a search for wl18xx_get_mac and wl12xx_sdio_raw_read did not
    produce similar errors.

    When memory allocation for XFRMA_ENCAP or XFRMA_COADDR fails,
    the error will not be reported because the -ENOMEM assignment
    to the err variable is overwritten before. Fix this by moving
    these two in front of the function so that memory allocation

    [ Upstream commit 897120d41e7afd9da435cb00041a142aeeb53c07 ]
    
    Checking value of MCP_INTF in mcp23s08_irq suggests that the handler may be
    called even when there is no interrupt pending.
    
    But the actual interrupt could happened between reading MCP_INTF and MCP_GPIO.
    In this situation we got nothing from MCP_INTF, but the event gets acknowledged
    on the expander by reading MCP_GPIO. This leads to losing events.
    
    Fix the problem by not reading any register until we see something in MCP_INTF.
    
    The error was reproduced and fix tested on MCP23017.

    dm space maps: don't reset space map allocation cursor when committing
    
    [ Upstream commit 5faafc77f7de69147d1e818026b9a0cbf036a7b2 ]
    
    Current commit code resets the place where the search for free blocks
    will begin back to the start of the metadata device.  There are a couple
    of repercussions to this:
    
    - The first allocation after the commit is likely to take longer than
      normal as it searches for a free block in an area that is likely to
      have very few free blocks (if any).
    
    - Any free blocks it finds will have been recently freed.  Reusing them
      means we have fewer old copies of the metadata to aid recovery from
      hardware error.
    
    Fix these issues by leaving the cursor alone, only resetting when the
    search hits the end of the metadata device.

    ipv6: use prandom_u32() for ID generation
    
    [ Upstream commit 62f20e068ccc50d6ab66fdb72ba90da2b9418c99 ]
    
    This is a complement to commit aa6dd211e4b1 ("inet: use bigger hash
    table for IP ID generation"), but focusing on some specific aspects
    of IPv6.
    
    Contary to IPv4, IPv6 only uses packet IDs with fragments, and with a
    minimum MTU of 1280, it's much less easy to force a remote peer to
    produce many fragments to explore its ID sequence. In addition packet
    IDs are 32-bit in IPv6, which further complicates their analysis. On
    the other hand, it is often easier to choose among plenty of possible
    source addresses and partially work around the bigger hash table the
    commit above permits, which leaves IPv6 partially exposed to some
    possibilities of remote analysis at the risk of weakening some
    protocols like DNS if some IDs can be predicted with a good enough
    probability.
    
    Given the wide range of permitted IDs, the risk of collision is extremely
    low so there's no need to rely on the positive increment algorithm that
    is shared with the IPv4 code via ip_idents_reserve(). We have a fast
    PRNG, so let's simply call prandom_u32() and be done with it.
    
    Performance measurements at 10 Gbps couldn't show any difference with
    the previous code, even when using a single core, because due to the
    large fragments, we're limited to only ~930 kpps at 10 Gbps and the cost
    of the random generation is completely offset by other operations and by
    the network transfer time. In addition, this change removes the need to
    update a shared entry in the idents table so it may even end up being
    slightly faster on large scale systems where this matters.
    
    The risk of at least one collision here is about 1/80 million among
    10 IDs, 1/850k among 100 IDs, and still only 1/8.5k among 1000 IDs,
    which remains very low compared to IPv4 where all IDs are reused
    every 4 to 80ms on a 10 Gbps flow depending on packet sizes.

    clk: tegra: Ensure that PLLU configuration is applied properly
    
    [ Upstream commit a7196048cd5168096c2c4f44a3939d7a6dcd06b9 ]
    
    The PLLU (USB) consists of the PLL configuration itself and configuration
    of the PLLU outputs. The PLLU programming is inconsistent on T30 vs T114,
    where T114 immediately bails out if PLLU is enabled and T30 re-enables
    a potentially already enabled PLL (left after bootloader) and then fully
    reprograms it, which could be unsafe to do. The correct way should be to
    skip enabling of the PLL if it's already enabled and then apply
    configuration to the outputs. This patch doesn't fix any known problems,
    it's a minor improvement.

    reiserfs: add check for invalid 1st journal block
    
    [ Upstream commit a149127be52fa7eaf5b3681a0317a2bbb772d5a9 ]
    
    syzbot reported divide error in reiserfs.
    The problem was in incorrect journal 1st block.
    
    Syzbot's reproducer manualy generated wrong superblock
    with incorrect 1st block. In journal_init() wasn't
    any checks about this particular case.
    
    For example, if 1st journal block is before superblock
    1st block, it can cause zeroing important superblock members
    in do_journal_end().

    net: Treat __napi_schedule_irqoff() as __napi_schedule() on PREEMPT_RT
    
    [ Upstream commit 8380c81d5c4fced6f4397795a5ae65758272bbfd ]
    
    __napi_schedule_irqoff() is an optimized version of __napi_schedule()
    which can be used where it is known that interrupts are disabled,
    e.g. in interrupt-handlers, spin_lock_irq() sections or hrtimer
    callbacks.
    
    On PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels this assumptions is not true. Force-
    threaded interrupt handlers and spinlocks are not disabling interrupts
    and the NAPI hrtimer callback is forced into softirq context which runs
    with interrupts enabled as well.
    
    Chasing all usage sites of __napi_schedule_irqoff() is a whack-a-mole
    game so make __napi_schedule_irqoff() invoke __napi_schedule() for
    PREEMPT_RT kernels.
    
    The callers of ____napi_schedule() in the networking core have been
    audited and are correct on PREEMPT_RT kernels as well.

    hugetlb: clear huge pte during flush function on mips platform
    
    [ Upstream commit 33ae8f801ad8bec48e886d368739feb2816478f2 ]
    
    If multiple threads are accessing the same huge page at the same
    time, hugetlb_cow will be called if one thread write the COW huge
    page. And function huge_ptep_clear_flush is called to notify other
    threads to clear the huge pte tlb entry. The other threads clear
    the huge pte tlb entry and reload it from page table, the reload
    huge pte entry may be old.
    
    This patch fixes this issue on mips platform, and it clears huge
    pte entry before notifying other threads to flush current huge
    page entry, it is similar with other architectures.

    commit 70b52f09080565030a530a784f1c9948a7f48ca3 upstream.
    
    According to the eMMC Spec:
    "When command queuing is enabled (CMDQ Mode En bit in CMDQ_MODE_EN
    field is set to ‘1’) class 11 commands are the only method through
    which data transfer tasks can be issued. Existing data transfer
    commands, namely CMD18/CMD17 and CMD25/CMD24, are not supported when
    command queuing is enabled."
    which means if CMDQ is enabled, the FFU commands will not be supported.
    To fix this issue, just simply disable CMDQ on the ioctl path, and
    re-enable CMDQ once ioctl request is completed.

    selftests/vm/pkeys: fix alloc_random_pkey() to make it really, really random
    
    [ Upstream commit f36ef407628835a7d7fb3d235b1f1aac7022d9a3 ]
    
    Patch series "selftests/vm/pkeys: Bug fixes and a new test".
    
    There has been a lot of activity on the x86 front around the XSAVE
    architecture which is used to context-switch processor state (among other
    things).  In addition, AMD has recently joined the protection keys club by
    adding processor support for PKU.
    
    The AMD implementation helped uncover a kernel bug around the PKRU "init
    state", which actually applied to Intel's implementation but was just
    harder to hit.  This series adds a test which is expected to help find
    this class of bug both on AMD and Intel.  All the work around pkeys on x86
    also uncovered a few bugs in the selftest.
    
    This patch (of 4):
    
    The "random" pkey allocation code currently does the good old:
    
            srand((unsigned int)time(NULL));
    
    *But*, it unfortunately does this on every random pkey allocation.
    
    There may be thousands of these a second.  time() has a one second
    resolution.  So, each time alloc_random_pkey() is called, the PRNG is
    *RESET* to time().  This is nasty.  Normally, if you do:
    
            srand(<ANYTHING>);
            foo = rand();
            bar = rand();
    
    You'll be quite guaranteed that 'foo' and 'bar' are different.  But, if
    you do:
    
            srand(1);
            foo = rand();
            srand(1);
            bar = rand();
    
    You are quite guaranteed that 'foo' and 'bar' are the *SAME*.  The recent
    "fix" effectively forced the test case to use the same "random" pkey for
    the whole test, unless the test run crossed a second boundary.
    
    Only run srand() once at program startup.
    
    This explains some very odd and persistent test failures I've been seeing.

    vfio/pci: Handle concurrent vma faults
    
    [ Upstream commit 6a45ece4c9af473555f01f0f8b97eba56e3c7d0d ]
    
    io_remap_pfn_range() will trigger a BUG_ON if it encounters a
    populated pte within the mapping range.  This can occur because we map
    the entire vma on fault and multiple faults can be blocked behind the
    vma_lock.  This leads to traces like the one reported below.
    
    We can use our vma_list to test whether a given vma is mapped to avoid
    this issue.

    For default (x16) scheme which is currently used by mvebu-uart.c driver,
    maximal divisor of UART base clock is 1023*16. Therefore there is limit for

    powerpc: Offline CPU in stop_this_cpu()
    
    [ Upstream commit bab26238bbd44d5a4687c0a64fd2c7f2755ea937 ]
    
    printk_safe_flush_on_panic() has special lock breaking code for the case
    where we panic()ed with the console lock held. It relies on panic IPI
    causing other CPUs to mark themselves offline.
    
    Do as most other architectures do.
    
    This effectively reverts commit de6e5d38417e ("powerpc: smp_send_stop do
    not offline stopped CPUs"), unfortunately it may result in some false
    positive warnings, but the alternative is more situations where we can

    of: Fix truncation of memory sizes on 32-bit platforms
    
    [ Upstream commit 2892d8a00d23d511a0591ac4b2ff3f050ae1f004 ]
    
    Variable "size" has type "phys_addr_t", which can be either 32-bit or
    64-bit on 32-bit systems, while "unsigned long" is always 32-bit on
    32-bit systems.  Hence the cast in
    
        (unsigned long)size / SZ_1M
    
    may truncate a 64-bit size to 32-bit, as casts have a higher operator
    precedence than divisions.
    
    Fix this by inverting the order of the cast and division, which should
    be safe for memory blocks smaller than 4 PiB.  Note that the division is
    actually a shift, as SZ_1M is a power-of-two constant, hence there is no
    need to use div_u64().
    
    While at it, use "%lu" to format "unsigned long".

    [ Upstream commit 92babc9938ebbf4050f2fba774836f7edc16a570 ]
    
    Add __aligned(8) to ensure the buffer passed to
    iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp() is suitable for the naturally
    aligned timestamp that will be inserted.
    
    Here an explicit structure is not used, because the holes would
    necessitate the addition of an explict memset(), to avoid a kernel
    data leak, making for a less minimal fix.

    serial: 8250: Actually allow UPF_MAGIC_MULTIPLIER baud rates
    
    [ Upstream commit 78bcae8616ac277d6cb7f38e211493948ed73e30 ]
    
    Support for magic baud rate divisors of 32770 and 32769 used with SMSC
    Super I/O chips for extra baud rates of 230400 and 460800 respectively
    where base rate is 115200[1] has been added around Linux 2.5.64, which
    predates our repo history, but the origin could be identified as commit
    2a717aad772f ("Merge with Linux 2.5.64.") with the old MIPS/Linux repo
    also at: <git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ralf/linux.git>.
    
    Code that is now in `serial8250_do_get_divisor' was added back then to
    `serial8250_get_divisor', but that code would only ever trigger if one
    of the higher baud rates was actually requested, and that cannot ever
    happen, because the earlier call to `serial8250_get_baud_rate' never
    returns them.  This is because it calls `uart_get_baud_rate' with the
    maximum requested being the base rate, that is clk/16 or 115200 for SMSC
    chips at their nominal clock rate.
    
    Fix it then and allow UPF_MAGIC_MULTIPLIER baud rates to be selected, by
    requesting the maximum baud rate of clk/4 rather than clk/16 if the flag
    has been set.  Also correct the minimum baud rate, observing that these
    ports only support actual (non-magic) divisors of up to 32767 only.

    staging: mt7621-dts: fix pci address for PCI memory range
    
    [ Upstream commit 5b4f167ef3555ec4c334a8dc89c1b44bb2c6bff5 ]
    
    Driver code call 'devm_of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources'
    to get resources and properly fill 'bridge->windows' and
    'bridge->dma_ranges'. After parsing the ranges and store
    as resources, at the end it makes a call to pci function
    'pci_add_resource_offset' to set the offset for the
    memory resource. To calculate offset, resource start address
    subtracts pci address of the range. MT7621 does not need
    any offset for the memory resource. Moreover, setting an
    offset got into 'WARN_ON' calls from pci devices driver code.
    Until now memory range pci_addr was being '0x00000000' and
    res->start is '0x60000000' but becase pci controller driver
    was manually setting resources and adding them using pci function
    'pci_add_resource' where a zero is passed as offset, things
    was properly working. Since PCI_IOBASE is defined now for
    ralink we don't set nothing manually anymore so we have to
    properly fix PCI address for this range to make things work
    and the new pci address must be set to '0x60000000'. Doing
    in this way the subtract result obtain zero as offset
    and pci device driver code properly works.

    iio: accel: hid: Fix buffer alignment in iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp()
    
    [ Upstream commit c6559bf796ccdb3a0c79db846af96c8f7046880b ]
    
    To make code more readable, use a structure to express the channel
    layout and ensure the timestamp is 8 byte aligned.
    Note this matches what was done in all the other hid sensor drivers.
    This one was missed previously due to an extra level of indirection.

    mwifiex: re-fix for unaligned accesses
    
    [ Upstream commit 8f4e3d48bb50765ab27ae5bebed2595b20de80a1 ]
    
    A patch from 2017 changed some accesses to DMA memory to use
    get_unaligned_le32() and similar interfaces, to avoid problems
    with doing unaligned accesson uncached memory.
    
    However, the change in the mwifiex_pcie_alloc_sleep_cookie_buf()
    function ended up changing the size of the access instead,
    as it operates on a pointer to u8.
    
    Change this function back to actually access the entire 32 bits.
    Note that the pointer is aligned by definition because it came
    from dma_alloc_coherent().

    fragmentation logic away from lwtunnel by carry encap headroom and
    use it in output MTU calculation. But the forwarding part was not
    covered and created difference in MTU for output and forwarding and
    further to silent drops on ipv4 forwarding path. Fix it by taking
    into account lwtunnel encap headroom.
    
    The same commit also introduced difference in how to treat RTAX_MTU
    in IPv4 and IPv6 where latter explicitly removes lwtunnel encap
    headroom from route MTU. Make IPv4 version do the same.

    The caller of wb_get_create() should pin the memcg, because
    wb_get_create() relies on this guarantee. The rcu read lock
    only can guarantee that the memcg css returned by css_from_id()
    cannot be released, but the reference of the memcg can be zero.
    
      rcu_read_lock()
      memcg_css = css_from_id()
      wb_get_create(memcg_css)
          cgwb_create(memcg_css)
              // css_get can change the ref counter from 0 back to 1
              css_get(memcg_css)
      rcu_read_unlock()
    
    Fix it by holding a reference to the css before calling
    wb_get_create(). This is not a problem I encountered in the
    real world. Just the result of a code review.

    ipv6: fix out-of-bound access in ip6_parse_tlv()
    
    [ Upstream commit 624085a31c1ad6a80b1e53f686bf6ee92abbf6e8 ]
    
    First problem is that optlen is fetched without checking
    there is more than one byte to parse.
    
    Fix this by taking care of IPV6_TLV_PAD1 before
    fetching optlen (under appropriate sanity checks against len)
    
    Second problem is that IPV6_TLV_PADN checks of zero
    padding are performed before the check of remaining length.

    bpf: Do not change gso_size during bpf_skb_change_proto()
    
    [ Upstream commit 364745fbe981a4370f50274475da4675661104df ]
    
    This is technically a backwards incompatible change in behaviour, but I'm
    going to argue that it is very unlikely to break things, and likely to fix
    *far* more then it breaks.
    
    In no particular order, various reasons follow:
    
    (a) I've long had a bug assigned to myself to debug a super rare kernel crash
    on Android Pixel phones which can (per stacktrace) be traced back to BPF clat
    IPv6 to IPv4 protocol conversion causing some sort of ugly failure much later
    on during transmit deep in the GSO engine, AFAICT precisely because of this
    change to gso_size, though I've never been able to manually reproduce it. I
    believe it may be related to the particular network offload support of attached
    USB ethernet dongle being used for tethering off of an IPv6-only cellular
    connection. The reason might be we end up with more segments than max permitted,
    or with a GSO packet with only one segment... (either way we break some
    assumption and hit a BUG_ON)
    
    (b) There is no check that the gso_size is > 20 when reducing it by 20, so we
    might end up with a negative (or underflowing) gso_size or a gso_size of 0.
    This can't possibly be good. Indeed this is probably somehow exploitable (or
    at least can result in a kernel crash) by delivering crafted packets and perhaps
    triggering an infinite loop or a divide by zero... As a reminder: gso_size (MSS)
    is related to MTU, but not directly derived from it: gso_size/MSS may be
    significantly smaller then one would get by deriving from local MTU. And on
    some NICs (which do loose MTU checking on receive, it may even potentially be
    larger, for example my work pc with 1500 MTU can receive 1520 byte frames [and
    sometimes does due to bugs in a vendor plat46 implementation]). Indeed even just
    going from 21 to 1 is potentially problematic because it increases the number
    of segments by a factor of 21 (think DoS, or some other crash due to too many
    segments).
    
    (c) It's always safe to not increase the gso_size, because it doesn't result in
    the max packet size increasing.  So the skb_increase_gso_size() call was always
    unnecessary for correctness (and outright undesirable, see later). As such the
    only part which is potentially dangerous (ie. could cause backwards compatibility
    issues) is the removal of the skb_decrease_gso_size() call.
    
    (d) If the packets are ultimately destined to the local device, then there is
    absolutely no benefit to playing around with gso_size. It only matters if the
    packets will egress the device. ie. we're either forwarding, or transmitting
    from the device.
    
    (e) This logic only triggers for packets which are GSO. It does not trigger for
    skbs which are not GSO. It will not convert a non-GSO MTU sized packet into a
    GSO packet (and you don't even know what the MTU is, so you can't even fix it).
    As such your transmit path must *already* be able to handle an MTU 20 bytes
    larger then your receive path (for IPv4 to IPv6 translation) - and indeed 28
    bytes larger due to IPv4 fragments. Thus removing the skb_decrease_gso_size()
    call doesn't actually increase the size of the packets your transmit side must
    be able to handle. ie. to handle non-GSO max-MTU packets, the IPv4/IPv6 device/
    route MTUs must already be set correctly. Since for example with an IPv4 egress
    MTU of 1500, IPv4 to IPv6 translation will already build 1520 byte IPv6 frames,
    so you need a 1520 byte device MTU. This means if your IPv6 device's egress
    MTU is 1280, your IPv4 route must be 1260 (and actually 1252, because of the
    need to handle fragments). This is to handle normal non-GSO packets. Thus the
    reduction is simply not needed for GSO packets, because when they're correctly
    built, they will already be the right size.
    
    (f) TSO/GSO should be able to exactly undo GRO: the number of packets (TCP
    segments) should not be modified, so that TCP's MSS counting works correctly
    (this matters for congestion control). If protocol conversion changes the
    gso_size, then the number of TCP segments may increase or decrease. Packet loss
    after protocol conversion can result in partial loss of MSS segments that the
    sender sent. How's the sending TCP stack going to react to receiving ACKs/SACKs
    in the middle of the segments it sent?
    
    (g) skb_{decrease,increase}_gso_size() are already no-ops for GSO_BY_FRAGS
    case (besides triggering WARN_ON_ONCE). This means you already cannot guarantee
    that gso_size (and thus resulting packet MTU) is changed. ie. you must assume
    it won't be changed.
    
    (h) changing gso_size is outright buggy for UDP GSO packets, where framing
    matters (I believe that's also the case for SCTP, but it's already excluded
    by [g]).  So the only remaining case is TCP, which also doesn't want it
    (see [f]).
    
    (i) see also the reasoning on the previous attempt at fixing this
    (commit fa7b83bf3b156c767f3e4a25bbf3817b08f3ff8e) which shows that the current
    behaviour causes TCP packet loss:
    
      In the forwarding path GRO -> BPF 6 to 4 -> GSO for TCP traffic, the
      coalesced packet payload can be > MSS, but < MSS + 20.
    
      bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4() will upgrade the MSS and it can be > the payload
      length. After then tcp_gso_segment checks for the payload length if it
      is <= MSS. The condition is causing the packet to be dropped.
    
      tcp_gso_segment():
        [...]
        mss = skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_size;
        if (unlikely(skb->len <= mss)) goto out;
        [...]
    
    Thus changing the gso_size is simply a very bad idea. Increasing is unnecessary
    and buggy, and decreasing can go negative.

    ipv6: exthdrs: do not blindly use init_net
    
    [ Upstream commit bcc3f2a829b9edbe3da5fb117ee5a63686d31834 ]
    
    I see no reason why max_dst_opts_cnt and max_hbh_opts_cnt
    are fetched from the initial net namespace.
    
    The other sysctls (max_dst_opts_len & max_hbh_opts_len)
    are in fact already using the current ns.
    
    Note: it is not clear why ipv6_destopt_rcv() use two ways to
    get to the netns :
    
     1) dev_net(dst->dev)
        Originally used to increment IPSTATS_MIB_INHDRERRORS
    
     2) dev_net(skb->dev)
         Tom used this variant in his patch.
    
    Maybe this calls to use ipv6_skb_net() instead ?

    pkt_sched: sch_qfq: fix qfq_change_class() error path
    
    [ Upstream commit 0cd58e5c53babb9237b741dbef711f0a9eb6d3fd ]
    
    If qfq_change_class() is unable to allocate memory for qfq_aggregate,
    it frees the class that has been inserted in the class hash table,
    but does not unhash it.
    
    Defer the insertion after the problematic allocation.

    net: ethernet: ezchip: fix error handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 0de449d599594f5472e00267d651615c7f2c6c1d ]
    
    As documented at drivers/base/platform.c for platform_get_irq:
    
     * Gets an IRQ for a platform device and prints an error message if finding the
     * IRQ fails. Device drivers should check the return value for errors so as to
     * not pass a negative integer value to the request_irq() APIs.
    
    So, the driver should check that platform_get_irq() return value
    is _negative_, not that it's equal to zero, because -ENXIO (return
    value from request_irq() if irq was not found) will
    pass this check and it leads to passing negative irq to request_irq()

    priv is netdev private data, but it is used

    [ Upstream commit 7c6090ee2a7b3315410cfc83a94c3eb057407b25 ]
    
    Fix to return a negative error code from the error handling
    case instead of 0, as done elsewhere in this function.
    
    If bpf_map_update_elem() failed, main() should return a negative error.

    RDMA/rxe: Fix qp reference counting for atomic ops
    
    [ Upstream commit 15ae1375ea91ae2dee6f12d71a79d8c0a10a30bf ]
    
    Currently the rdma_rxe driver attempts to protect atomic responder
    resources by taking a reference to the qp which is only freed when the
    resource is recycled for a new read or atomic operation. This means that
    in normal circumstances there is almost always an extra qp reference once
    an atomic operation has been executed which prevents cleaning up the qp
    and associated pd and cqs when the qp is destroyed.
    
    This patch removes the call to rxe_add_ref() in send_atomic_ack() and the
    call to rxe_drop_ref() in free_rd_atomic_resource(). If the qp is
    destroyed while a peer is retrying an atomic op it will cause the
    operation to fail which is acceptable.

    Right now wcn->hal_buf is allocated in wcn36xx_start(). This is a problem
    since we should have setup all of the buffers we required by the time
    ieee80211_register_hw() is called.
    
    struct ieee80211_ops callbacks may run prior to mac_start() and therefore
    wcn->hal_buf must be initialized.
    
    This is easily remediated by moving the allocation to probe() taking the
    opportunity to tidy up freeing memory by using devm_kmalloc().

    CARL9170_LEDS selects MAC80211_LEDS even though its kconfig

    Fix this by making CARL9170_LEDS depend on MAC80211_LEDS, where
    the latter supplies any needed dependencies on LEDS_CLASS.

    ocfs2: fix snprintf() checking
    
    [ Upstream commit 54e948c60cc843b6e84dc44496edc91f51d2a28e ]
    
    The snprintf() function returns the number of bytes which would have been
    printed if the buffer was large enough.  In other words it can return ">=
    remain" but this code assumes it returns "== remain".
    
    The run time impact of this bug is not very severe.  The next iteration
    through the loop would trigger a WARN() when we pass a negative limit to
    snprintf().  We would then return success instead of -E2BIG.
    
    The kernel implementation of snprintf() will never return negatives so
    there is no need to check and I have deleted that dead code.

    ACPI: sysfs: Fix a buffer overrun problem with description_show()
    
    [ Upstream commit 888be6067b97132c3992866bbcf647572253ab3f ]
    
    Currently, a device description can be obtained using ACPI, if the _STR
    method exists for a particular device, and then exposed to the userspace
    via a sysfs object as a string value.
    
    If the _STR method is available for a given device then the data
    (usually a Unicode string) is read and stored in a buffer (of the
    ACPI_TYPE_BUFFER type) with a pointer to said buffer cached in the
    struct acpi_device_pnp for later access.
    
    The description_show() function is responsible for exposing the device
    description to the userspace via a corresponding sysfs object and
    internally calls the utf16s_to_utf8s() function with a pointer to the
    buffer that contains the Unicode string so that it can be converted from
    UTF16 encoding to UTF8 and thus allowing for the value to be safely
    stored and later displayed.
    
    When invoking the utf16s_to_utf8s() function, the description_show()
    function also sets a limit of the data that can be saved into a provided
    buffer as a result of the character conversion to be a total of
    PAGE_SIZE, and upon completion, the utf16s_to_utf8s() function returns
    an integer value denoting the number of bytes that have been written
    into the provided buffer.
    
    Following the execution of the utf16s_to_utf8s() a newline character
    will be added at the end of the resulting buffer so that when the value
    is read in the userspace through the sysfs object then it would include
    newline making it more accessible when working with the sysfs file
    system in the shell, etc.  Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but if
    the function utf16s_to_utf8s() happens to return the number of bytes
    written to be precisely PAGE_SIZE, then we would overrun the buffer and
    write the newline character outside the allotted space which can have
    undefined consequences or result in a failure.
    
    To fix this buffer overrun, ensure that there always is enough space
    left for the newline character to be safely appended.

    crypto: nx - Fix RCU warning in nx842_OF_upd_status
    
    [ Upstream commit 2a96726bd0ccde4f12b9b9a9f61f7b1ac5af7e10 ]
    
    The function nx842_OF_upd_status triggers a sparse RCU warning when
    it directly dereferences the RCU-protected devdata.  This appears
    to be an accident as there was another variable of the same name
    that was passed in from the caller.
    
    After it was removed (because the main purpose of using it, to
    update the status member was itself removed) the global variable
    unintenionally stood in as its replacement.
    
    This patch restores the devdata parameter.

    spi: spi-sun6i: Fix chipselect/clock bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d7993b234c9fad8cb6bec6adfaa74694ba85ecb ]
    
    The current sun6i SPI implementation initializes the transfer too early,
    resulting in SCK going high before the transfer. When using an additional
    (gpio) chipselect with sun6i, the chipselect is asserted at a time when
    clock is high, making the SPI transfer fail.
    
    This is due to SUN6I_GBL_CTL_BUS_ENABLE being written into
    SUN6I_GBL_CTL_REG at an early stage. Moving that to the transfer
    function, hence, right before the transfer starts, mitigates that
    problem.

    btrfs: clear log tree recovering status if starting transaction fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 1aeb6b563aea18cd55c73cf666d1d3245a00f08c ]
    
    When a log recovery is in progress, lots of operations have to take that
    into account, so we keep this status per tree during the operation. Long
    time ago error handling revamp patch 79787eaab461 ("btrfs: replace many
    BUG_ONs with proper error handling") removed clearing of the status in
    an error branch. Add it back as was intended in e02119d5a7b4 ("Btrfs:
    Add a write ahead tree log to optimize synchronous operations").
    
    There are probably no visible effects, log replay is done only during
    mount and if it fails all structures are cleared so the stale status
    won't be kept.

    Fans 7..12 do not have their own set of configuration registers.
    So far the code ignored that and read beyond the end of the configuration

    The datasheet is quite vague when it comes to defining the tachometer

    Rename struct sms_msg_data4 to sms_msg_data5 and increase the size of

    Also, there is no need for the object _trigger_msg_ of type struct
    sms_msg_data *, when _msg_ can be used, directly. Notice that msg_data
    in struct sms_msg_data is a one-element array, which causes multiple

    the out-of-bounds warnings are actually valid and should be addressed.
    
    Fix this by declaring object _msg_ of type struct sms_msg_data5 *,
    which contains a 5-elements array, instead of just 4. And use
    _msg_ directly, instead of creating object trigger_msg.
    
    This helps with the ongoing efforts to enable -Warray-bounds by fixing
    the following warnings:

    [ Upstream commit 8ed339f23d41e21660a389adf2e7b2966d457ff6 ]
    
    The direction of the pipe argument must match the request-type direction
    bit or control requests may fail depending on the host-controller-driver
    implementation.
    
    Control transfers without a data stage are treated as OUT requests by
    the USB stack and should be using usb_sndctrlpipe(). Failing to do so
    will now trigger a warning.
    
    Fix the gl860_RTx() helper so that zero-length control reads fail with
    an error message instead. Note that there are no current callers that
    would trigger this.

    has to be used, ata_host_activate() hits the WARN_ON() due to 'irq_handler'
    parameter being non-NULL if the polling mode is selected.  Let's only set
    the pointer to the driver's IRQ handler if platform_get_irq() returns a
    valid IRQ # -- this should avoid the unnecessary WARN_ON()...

    media: I2C: change 'RST' to "RSET" to fix multiple build errors
    
    [ Upstream commit 8edcb5049ac29aa3c8acc5ef15dd4036543d747e ]
    
    The use of an enum named 'RST' conflicts with a #define macro
    named 'RST' in arch/mips/include/asm/mach-rc32434/rb.h.
    
    The MIPS use of RST was there first (AFAICT), so change the
    media/i2c/ uses of RST to be named 'RSET'.
    'git grep -w RSET' does not report any naming conflicts with the
    new name.
    
    This fixes multiple build errors:

    disable the device, it should call pm_runtime_put()
    instead of pm_runtime_disable(), as the goal here is to
    decrement the usage_count and not to disable PM runtime.

    ia64: mca_drv: fix incorrect array size calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit c5f320ff8a79501bb59338278336ec43acb9d7e2 ]
    
    gcc points out a mistake in the mca driver that goes back to before the
    git history:
    
    arch/ia64/kernel/mca_drv.c: In function 'init_record_index_pools':
    arch/ia64/kernel/mca_drv.c:346:54: error: expression does not compute the number of elements in this array; element typ
    e is 'int', not 'size_t' {aka 'long unsigned int'} [-Werror=sizeof-array-div]
      346 |         for (i = 1; i < sizeof sal_log_sect_min_sizes/sizeof(size_t); i++)
          |                                                      ^
    
    This is the same as sizeof(size_t), which is two shorter than the actual
    array.  Use the ARRAY_SIZE() macro to get the correct calculation instead.

    [ Upstream commit d1059c1b1146870c52f3dac12cb7b6cbf39ed27f ]
    
    A custom DSDT file is mostly used during development or debugging,
    and in that case it is quite likely to want to rebuild the kernel
    after changing ONLY the content of the DSDT.
    
    This patch adds the custom DSDT as a prerequisite to tables.o
    to ensure a rebuild if the DSDT file is updated. Make will merge
    the prerequisites from multiple rules for the same target.

    clocksource: Retry clock read if long delays detected
    
    [ Upstream commit db3a34e17433de2390eb80d436970edcebd0ca3e ]
    
    When the clocksource watchdog marks a clock as unstable, this might be due
    to that clock being unstable or it might be due to delays that happen to
    occur between the reads of the two clocks.  Yes, interrupts are disabled
    across those two reads, but there are no shortage of things that can delay
    interrupts-disabled regions of code ranging from SMI handlers to vCPU
    preemption.  It would be good to have some indication as to why the clock
    was marked unstable.
    
    Therefore, re-read the watchdog clock on either side of the read from the
    clock under test.  If the watchdog clock shows an excessive time delta
    between its pair of reads, the reads are retried.
    
    The maximum number of retries is specified by a new kernel boot parameter
    clocksource.max_cswd_read_retries, which defaults to three, that is, up to
    four reads, one initial and up to three retries.  If more than one retry
    was required, a message is printed on the console (the occasional single
    retry is expected behavior, especially in guest OSes).  If the maximum
    number of retries is exceeded, the clock under test will be marked
    unstable.  However, the probability of this happening due to various sorts
    of delays is quite small.  In addition, the reason (clock-read delays) for
    the unstable marking will be apparent.

    ACPICA: Fix memory leak caused by _CID repair function
    
    [ Upstream commit c27bac0314131b11bccd735f7e8415ac6444b667 ]
    
    ACPICA commit 180cb53963aa876c782a6f52cc155d951b26051a
    
    According to the ACPI spec, _CID returns a package containing
    hardware ID's. Each element of an ASL package contains a reference
    count from the parent package as well as the element itself.
    
    Name (TEST, Package() {
        "String object" // this package element has a reference count of 2
    })
    
    A memory leak was caused in the _CID repair function because it did
    not decrement the reference count created by the package. Fix the
    memory leak by calling acpi_ut_remove_reference on _CID package elements
    that represent a hardware ID (_HID).

    random32: Fix implicit truncation warning in prandom_seed_state()
    
    [ Upstream commit d327ea15a305024ef0085252fa3657bbb1ce25f5 ]
    
    sparse generates the following warning:
    
     include/linux/prandom.h:114:45: sparse: sparse: cast truncates bits from
     constant value
    
    This is because the 64-bit seed value is manipulated and then placed in a
    u32, causing an implicit cast and truncation. A forced cast to u32 doesn't
    prevent this warning, which is reasonable because a typecast doesn't prove
    that truncation was expected.
    
    Logical-AND the value with 0xffffffff to make explicit that truncation to
    32-bit is intended.

    block_dump: remove block_dump feature in mark_inode_dirty()
    
    [ Upstream commit 12e0613715e1cf305fffafaf0e89d810d9a85cc0 ]
    
    block_dump is an old debugging interface, one of it's functions is used
    to print the information about who write which file on disk. If we
    enable block_dump through /proc/sys/vm/block_dump and turn on debug log
    level, we can gather information about write process name, target file
    name and disk from kernel message. This feature is realized in
    block_dump___mark_inode_dirty(), it print above information into kernel
    message directly when marking inode dirty, so it is noisy and can easily
    trigger log storm. At the same time, get the dentry refcount is also not
    safe, we found it will lead to deadlock on ext4 file system with
    data=journal mode.
    
    After tracepoints has been introduced into the kernel, we got a
    tracepoint in __mark_inode_dirty(), which is a better replacement of
    block_dump___mark_inode_dirty(). The only downside is that it only trace
    the inode number and not a file name, but it probably doesn't matter
    because the original printed file name in block_dump is not accurate in
    some cases, and we can still find it through the inode number and device
    id. So this patch delete the dirting inode part of block_dump feature.

    lib: vsprintf: Fix handling of number field widths in vsscanf
    
    [ Upstream commit 900fdc4573766dd43b847b4f54bd4a1ee2bc7360 ]
    
    The existing code attempted to handle numbers by doing a strto[u]l(),
    ignoring the field width, and then repeatedly dividing to extract the
    field out of the full converted value. If the string contains a run of
    valid digits longer than will fit in a long or long long, this would
    overflow and no amount of dividing can recover the correct value.
    
    This patch fixes vsscanf() to obey number field widths when parsing
    the number.
    
    A new _parse_integer_limit() is added that takes a limit for the number
    of characters to parse. The number field conversion in vsscanf is changed
    to use this new function.
    
    If a number starts with a radix prefix, the field width  must be long
    enough for at last one digit after the prefix. If not, it will be handled
    like this:
    
     sscanf("0x4", "%1i", &i): i=0, scanning continues with the 'x'
     sscanf("0x4", "%2i", &i): i=0, scanning continues with the '4'
    
    This is consistent with the observed behaviour of userland sscanf.
    
    Note that this patch does NOT fix the problem of a single field value
    overflowing the target type. So for example:
    
      sscanf("123456789abcdef", "%x", &i);
    
    Will not produce the correct result because the value obviously overflows
    INT_MAX. But sscanf will report a successful conversion.
    
    Note that where a very large number is used to mean "unlimited", the value
    INT_MAX is used for consistency with the behaviour of vsnprintf().

    ACPI: processor idle: Fix up C-state latency if not ordered
    
    [ Upstream commit 65ea8f2c6e230bdf71fed0137cf9e9d1b307db32 ]
    
    Generally, the C-state latency is provided by the _CST method or
    FADT, but some OEM platforms using AMD Picasso, Renoir, Van Gogh,
    and Cezanne set the C2 latency greater than C3's which causes the
    C2 state to be skipped.
    
    That will block the core entering PC6, which prevents S0ix working
    properly on Linux systems.
    
    In other operating systems, the latency values are not validated and
    this does not cause problems by skipping states.
    
    To avoid this issue on Linux, detect when latencies are not an
    arithmetic progression and sort them.

    EDAC/ti: Add missing MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE
    
    [ Upstream commit 0a37f32ba5272b2d4ec8c8d0f6b212b81b578f7e ]
    
    The module misses MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() for of_device_id tables and thus
    never autoloads on ID matches.
    
    Add the missing declaration.

    HID: do not use down_interruptible() when unbinding devices
    
    [ Upstream commit f2145f8dc566c4f3b5a8deb58dcd12bed4e20194 ]
    
    Action of unbinding driver from a device is not cancellable and should not
    fail, and driver core does not pay attention to the result of "remove"
    method, therefore using down_interruptible() in hid_device_remove() does
    not make sense.

    btrfs: disable build on platforms having page size 256K
    
    [ Upstream commit b05fbcc36be1f8597a1febef4892053a0b2f3f60 ]
    
    With a config having PAGE_SIZE set to 256K, BTRFS build fails
    with the following message
    
      include/linux/compiler_types.h:326:38: error: call to
      '__compiletime_assert_791' declared with attribute error:
      BUILD_BUG_ON failed: (BTRFS_MAX_COMPRESSED % PAGE_SIZE) != 0
    
    BTRFS_MAX_COMPRESSED being 128K, BTRFS cannot support platforms with
    256K pages at the time being.
    
    There are two platforms that can select 256K pages:
     - hexagon
     - powerpc
    
    Disable BTRFS when 256K page size is selected. Supporting this would
    require changes to the subpage mode that's currently being developed.
    Given that 256K is many times larger than page sizes commonly used and
    for what the algorithms and structures have been tuned, it's out of
    scope and disabling build is a reasonable option.

    The risk of especulation is actually almost-non-existing here,
    as there are very few users of TCP/IP using the DVB stack,
    as, this is mainly used with DVB-S/S2 cards, and only by people
    that receives TCP/IP from satellite connections, which limits
    a lot the number of users of such feature(*).
    
    (*) In thesis, DVB-C cards could also benefit from it, but I'm
    yet to see a hardware that supports it.
    
    Yet, fixing it is trivial.

    crypto: shash - avoid comparing pointers to exported functions under CFI
    
    [ Upstream commit 22ca9f4aaf431a9413dcc115dd590123307f274f ]
    
    crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey() is implemented by testing whether the
    .setkey() member of a struct shash_alg points to the default version,
    called shash_no_setkey(). As crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey() is a static
    inline, this requires shash_no_setkey() to be exported to modules.
    
    Unfortunately, when building with CFI, function pointers are routed
    via CFI stubs which are private to each module (or to the kernel proper)
    and so this function pointer comparison may fail spuriously.
    
    Let's fix this by turning crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey() into an out of
    line function.

    media: dvd_usb: memory leak in cinergyt2_fe_attach
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ad1efee086e0e913914fa2b2173efb830bad68c ]
    
    When the driver fails to talk with the hardware with dvb_usb_generic_rw,
    it will return an error to dvb_usb_adapter_frontend_init. However, the
    driver forgets to free the resource (e.g., struct cinergyt2_fe_state),
    which leads to a memory leak.
    
    Fix this by freeing struct cinergyt2_fe_state when dvb_usb_generic_rw
    fails in cinergyt2_frontend_attach.

    media: bt8xx: Fix a missing check bug in bt878_probe
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a4520090681853e6b850cbe54b27247a013e0e5 ]
    
    In 'bt878_irq', the driver calls 'tasklet_schedule', but this tasklet is
    set in 'dvb_bt8xx_load_card' of another driver 'dvb-bt8xx'.
    However, this two drivers are separate. The user may not load the
    'dvb-bt8xx' driver when loading the 'bt8xx' driver, that is, the tasklet
    has not been initialized when 'tasklet_schedule' is called, so it is
    necessary to check whether the tasklet is initialized in 'bt878_probe'.
    
    Fix this by adding a check at the end of bt878_probe.

    media: pvrusb2: fix warning in pvr2_i2c_core_done
    
    [ Upstream commit f8194e5e63fdcb349e8da9eef9e574d5b1d687cb ]
    
    syzbot has reported the following warning in pvr2_i2c_done:
    
            sysfs group 'power' not found for kobject '1-0043'
    
    When the device is disconnected (pvr_hdw_disconnect), the i2c adapter is
    not unregistered along with the USB and v4l2 teardown. As part of the USB
    device disconnect, the sysfs files of the subdevices are also deleted.
    So, by the time pvr_i2c_core_done is called by pvr_context_destroy, the
    sysfs files have been deleted.
    
    To fix this, unregister the i2c adapter too in pvr_hdw_disconnect. Make
    the device deregistration code shared by calling pvr_hdw_disconnect from
    pvr2_hdw_destroy.

    The cobalt_s_bit_sysctrl reads the old register value over PCI,

    This is used among other things for setting the HPD output pin.
    
    But if the HPD is changed for multiple inputs at the same time,
    then this causes a race condition where a stale value is read.

    spi: Make of_register_spi_device also set the fwnode
    
    [ Upstream commit 0e793ba77c18382f08e440260fe72bc6fce2a3cb ]
    
    Currently, the SPI core doesn't set the struct device fwnode pointer
    when it creates a new SPI device. This means when the device is
    registered the fwnode is NULL and the check in device_add which sets
    the fwnode->dev pointer is skipped. This wasn't previously an issue,
    however these two patches:
    
    commit 4731210c09f5 ("gpiolib: Bind gpio_device to a driver to enable
    fw_devlink=on by default")
    commit ced2af419528 ("gpiolib: Don't probe gpio_device if it's not the
    primary device")
    
    Added some code to the GPIO core which relies on using that
    fwnode->dev pointer to determine if a driver is bound to the fwnode
    and if not bind a stub GPIO driver. This means the GPIO providers
    behind SPI will get both the expected driver and this stub driver
    causing the stub driver to fail if it attempts to request any pin
    configuration. For example on my system:
    
    madera-pinctrl madera-pinctrl: pin gpio5 already requested by madera-pinctrl; cannot claim for gpiochip3
    madera-pinctrl madera-pinctrl: pin-4 (gpiochip3) status -22
    madera-pinctrl madera-pinctrl: could not request pin 4 (gpio5) from group aif1  on device madera-pinctrl
    gpio_stub_drv gpiochip3: Error applying setting, reverse things back
    gpio_stub_drv: probe of gpiochip3 failed with error -22
    
    The firmware node on the device created by the GPIO framework is set
    through the of_node pointer hence things generally actually work,
    however that fwnode->dev is never set, as the check was skipped at
    device_add time. This fix appears to match how the I2C subsystem
    handles the same situation.

    After the userspace copy is done the request will be ended, but
    req->out.h.error will remain uninitialized.  Also the copy might block
    despite being already aborted.
    
    Fix both issues by not allowing the request to be queued on the fpq->io
    list after fuse_abort_conn() has processed this list.

    evm: Refuse EVM_ALLOW_METADATA_WRITES only if an HMAC key is loaded
    
    commit 9acc89d31f0c94c8e573ed61f3e4340bbd526d0c upstream.
    
    EVM_ALLOW_METADATA_WRITES is an EVM initialization flag that can be set to
    temporarily disable metadata verification until all xattrs/attrs necessary
    to verify an EVM portable signature are copied to the file. This flag is
    cleared when EVM is initialized with an HMAC key, to avoid that the HMAC is
    calculated on unverified xattrs/attrs.
    
    Currently EVM unnecessarily denies setting this flag if EVM is initialized
    with a public key, which is not a concern as it cannot be used to trust
    xattrs/attrs updates. This patch removes this limitation.

    evm: Execute evm_inode_init_security() only when an HMAC key is loaded
    
    commit 9eea2904292c2d8fa98df141d3bf7c41ec9dc1b5 upstream.
    
    evm_inode_init_security() requires an HMAC key to calculate the HMAC on
    initial xattrs provided by LSMs. However, it checks generically whether a
    key has been loaded, including also public keys, which is not correct as
    public keys are not suitable to calculate the HMAC.
    
    Originally, support for signature verification was introduced to verify a
    possibly immutable initial ram disk, when no new files are created, and to
    switch to HMAC for the root filesystem. By that time, an HMAC key should
    have been loaded and usable to calculate HMACs for new files.
    
    More recently support for requiring an HMAC key was removed from the
    kernel, so that signature verification can be used alone. Since this is a
    legitimate use case, evm_inode_init_security() should not return an error
    when no HMAC key has been loaded.
    
    This patch fixes this problem by replacing the evm_key_loaded() check with
    a check of the EVM_INIT_HMAC flag in evm_initialized.

    powerpc/stacktrace: Fix spurious "stale" traces in raise_backtrace_ipi()
    
    commit 7c6986ade69e3c81bac831645bc72109cd798a80 upstream.
    
    In raise_backtrace_ipi() we iterate through the cpumask of CPUs, sending
    each an IPI asking them to do a backtrace, but we don't wait for the
    backtrace to happen.
    
    We then iterate through the CPU mask again, and if any CPU hasn't done
    the backtrace and cleared itself from the mask, we print a trace on its
    behalf, noting that the trace may be "stale".
    
    This works well enough when a CPU is not responding, because in that
    case it doesn't receive the IPI and the sending CPU is left to print the
    trace. But when all CPUs are responding we are left with a race between
    the sending and receiving CPUs, if the sending CPU wins the race then it
    will erroneously print a trace.
    
    This leads to spurious "stale" traces from the sending CPU, which can
    then be interleaved messily with the receiving CPU, note the CPU
    numbers, eg:
    
      [ 1658.929157][    C7] rcu: Stack dump where RCU GP kthread last ran:
      [ 1658.929223][    C7] Sending NMI from CPU 7 to CPUs 1:
      [ 1658.929303][    C1] NMI backtrace for cpu 1
      [ 1658.929303][    C7] CPU 1 didn't respond to backtrace IPI, inspecting paca.
      [ 1658.929362][    C1] CPU: 1 PID: 325 Comm: kworker/1:1H Tainted: G        W   E     5.13.0-rc2+ #46
      [ 1658.929405][    C7] irq_soft_mask: 0x01 in_mce: 0 in_nmi: 0 current: 325 (kworker/1:1H)
      [ 1658.929465][    C1] Workqueue: events_highpri test_work_fn [test_lockup]
      [ 1658.929549][    C7] Back trace of paca->saved_r1 (0xc0000000057fb400) (possibly stale):

    To fix it, change the logic so that the sending CPU waits 5s for the
    receiving CPU to print its trace. If the receiving CPU prints its trace
    successfully then the sending CPU just continues, avoiding any spurious
    "stale" trace.
    
    This has the added benefit of allowing all CPUs to print their traces in
    order and avoids any interleaving of their output.

    seq_buf: Make trace_seq_putmem_hex() support data longer than 8
    
    commit 6a2cbc58d6c9d90cd74288cc497c2b45815bc064 upstream.
    
    Since the raw memory 'data' does not go forward, it will dump repeated
    data if the data length is more than 8. If we want to dump longer data
    blocks, we need to repeatedly call macro SEQ_PUT_HEX_FIELD. I think it
    is a bit redundant, and multiple function calls also affect the performance.

    tracepoint: Add tracepoint_probe_register_may_exist() for BPF tracing
    
    commit 9913d5745bd720c4266805c8d29952a3702e4eca upstream.
    
    All internal use cases for tracepoint_probe_register() is set to not ever
    be called with the same function and data. If it is, it is considered a
    bug, as that means the accounting of handling tracepoints is corrupted.
    If the function and data for a tracepoint is already registered when
    tracepoint_probe_register() is called, it will call WARN_ON_ONCE() and
    return with EEXISTS.
    
    The BPF system call can end up calling tracepoint_probe_register() with
    the same data, which now means that this can trigger the warning because
    of a user space process. As WARN_ON_ONCE() should not be called because
    user space called a system call with bad data, there needs to be a way to
    register a tracepoint without triggering a warning.
    
    Enter tracepoint_probe_register_may_exist(), which can be called, but will
    not cause a WARN_ON() if the probe already exists. It will still error out
    with EEXIST, which will then be sent to the user space that performed the
    BPF system call.
    
    This keeps the previous testing for issues with other users of the
    tracepoint code, while letting BPF call it with duplicated data and not

    tracing/histograms: Fix parsing of "sym-offset" modifier
    
    commit 26c563731056c3ee66f91106c3078a8c36bb7a9e upstream.
    
    With the addition of simple mathematical operations (plus and minus), the
    parsing of the "sym-offset" modifier broke, as it took the '-' part of the
    "sym-offset" as a minus, and tried to break it up into a mathematical
    operation of "field.sym - offset", in which case it failed to parse
    (unless the event had a field called "offset").
    
    Both .sym and .sym-offset modifiers should not be entered into
    mathematical calculations anyway. If ".sym-offset" is found in the
    modifier, then simply make it not an operation that can be calculated on.

    rsi: fix AP mode with WPA failure due to encrypted EAPOL
    
    commit 314538041b5632ffaf64798faaeabaf2793fe029 upstream.
    
    In AP mode WPA2-PSK connections were not established.
    
    The reason was that the AP was sending the first message
    of the 4 way handshake encrypted, even though no pairwise
    key had (correctly) yet been set.
    
    Encryption was enabled if the "security_enable" driver flag
    was set and encryption was not explicitly disabled by
    IEEE80211_TX_INTFL_DONT_ENCRYPT.
    
    However security_enable was set when *any* key, including
    the AP GTK key, had been set which was causing unwanted
    encryption even if no key was avaialble for the unicast
    packet to be sent.
    
    Fix this by adding a check that we have a key and drop
    the old security_enable driver flag which is insufficient
    and redundant.
    
    The Redpine downstream out of tree driver does it this way too.
    
    Regarding the Fixes tag the actual code being modified was
    introduced earlier, with the original driver submission, in
    dad0d04fa7ba ("rsi: Add RS9113 wireless driver"), however
    at that time AP mode was not yet supported so there was
    no bug at that point.
    
    So I have tagged the introduction of AP support instead
    which was part of the patch set "rsi: support for AP mode" [1]
    
    It is not clear whether AP WPA has ever worked, I can see nothing
    on the kernel side that broke it afterwards yet the AP support
    patch series says "Tests are performed to confirm aggregation,
    connections in WEP and WPA/WPA2 security."
    
    One possibility is that the initial tests were done with a modified
    userspace (hostapd).

    rsi: Assign beacon rate settings to the correct rate_info descriptor field
    
    commit b1c3a24897bd528f2f4fda9fea7da08a84ae25b6 upstream.
    
    The RSI_RATE_x bits must be assigned to struct rsi_data_desc rate_info
    field. The rest of the driver does it correctly, except this one place,
    so fix it. This is also aligned with the RSI downstream vendor driver.
    Without this patch, an AP operating at 5 GHz does not transmit any
    beacons at all, this patch fixes that.

    It doesn't make sense to clobber the const driver-side buffer, if a

    ath9k: Fix kernel NULL pointer dereference during ath_reset_internal()
    
    commit fb312ac5ccb007e843f982b38d4d6886ba4b32f2 upstream.
    
    I got this crash more times during debugging of PCIe controller and crash
    happens somehow at the time when PCIe kernel code started link retraining (as
    part of ASPM code) when at the same time PCIe link went down and ath9k probably
    executed hw reset procedure.
    
    Currently I'm not able to reproduce this issue as it looks like to be
    some race condition between link training, ASPM, link down and reset
    path. And as always, race conditions which depends on more input
    parameters are hard to reproduce as it depends on precise timings.
    
    But it is clear that pointers are zero in this case and should be
    properly filled as same code pattern is used in ath9k_stop() function.
    Anyway I was able to reproduce this crash by manually triggering ath
    reset worker prior putting card up. I created simple patch to export
    reset functionality via debugfs and use it to "simulate" of triggering
    reset.    s proved that NULL-pointer dereference issue is there.
    
    Function ath9k_hw_reset() is dereferencing chan structure pointer, so it
    needs to be non-NULL pointer.
    
    Function ath9k_stop() already contains code which sets ah->curchan to valid
    non-NULL pointer prior calling ath9k_hw_reset() function.
    
    Add same code pattern also into ath_reset_internal() function to prevent
    kernel NULL pointer dereference in ath9k_hw_reset() function.
    
    This change fixes kernel NULL pointer dereference in ath9k_hw_reset() which
    is caused by calling ath9k_hw_reset() from ath_reset_internal() with NULL
    chan structure.

    configure between active and stand-by mode. In the original driver
    BIT(1) is used, which does a software reset instead.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by using BIT(0) as als_mode_active for
    the ltr559 chip.

    iio: ltr501: mark register holding upper 8 bits of ALS_DATA{0,1} and PS_DATA as volatile, too
    
    commit 2ac0b029a04b673ce83b5089368f467c5dca720c upstream.
    
    The regmap is configured for 8 bit registers, uses a RB-Tree cache and
    marks several registers as volatile (i.e. do not cache).
    
    The ALS and PS data registers in the chip are 16 bit wide and spans
    two regmap registers. In the current driver only the base register is
    marked as volatile, resulting in the upper register only read once.
    
    Further the data sheet notes:
    
    | When the I2C read operation starts, all four ALS data registers are
    | locked until the I2C read operation of register 0x8B is completed.
    
    Which results in the registers never update after the 2nd read.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by marking the upper 8 bits of the ALS
    and PS registers as volatile, too.

    iio: light: tcs3472: do not free unallocated IRQ
    
    commit 7cd04c863f9e1655d607705455e7714f24451984 upstream.
    
    Allocating an IRQ is conditional to the IRQ existence, but freeing it
    was not. If no IRQ was allocate, the driver would still try to free
    IRQ 0. Add the missing checks.
    
    This fixes the following trace when the driver is removed:

    s390/cio: dont call css_wait_for_slow_path() inside a lock
    
    commit c749d8c018daf5fba6dfac7b6c5c78b27efd7d65 upstream.
    
    Currently css_wait_for_slow_path() gets called inside the chp->lock.
    The path-verification-loop of slowpath inside this lock could lead to
    deadlock as reported by the lockdep validator.
    
    The ccw_device_get_chp_desc() during the instance of a device-set-online
    would try to acquire the same 'chp->lock' to read the chp->desc.
    The instance of this function can get called from multiple scenario,
    like probing or setting-device online manually. This could, in some
    corner-cases lead to the deadlock.
    
    lockdep validator reported this as,
    
            CPU0                    CPU1
            ----                    ----
       lock(&chp->lock);
                                    lock(kn->active#43);
                                    lock(&chp->lock);
       lock((wq_completion)cio);
    
    The chp->lock was introduced to serialize the access of struct
    channel_path. This lock is not needed for the css_wait_for_slow_path()
    function, so invoke the slow-path function outside this lock.

    SUNRPC: Should wake up the privileged task firstly.
    
    commit 5483b904bf336948826594610af4c9bbb0d9e3aa upstream.
    
    When find a task from wait queue to wake up, a non-privileged task may
    be found out, rather than the privileged. This maybe lead a deadlock
    same as commit dfe1fe75e00e ("NFSv4: Fix deadlock between nfs4_evict_inode()
    and nfs4_opendata_get_inode()"):
    
    Privileged delegreturn task is queued to privileged list because all
    the slots are assigned. If there has no enough slot to wake up the
    non-privileged batch tasks(session less than 8 slot), then the privileged
    delegreturn task maybe lost waked up because the found out task can't
    get slot since the session is on draining.
    
    So we should treate the privileged task as the emergency task, and
    execute it as for as we can.

    SUNRPC: Fix the batch tasks count wraparound.
    
    commit fcb170a9d825d7db4a3fb870b0300f5a40a8d096 upstream.
    
    The 'queue->nr' will wraparound from 0 to 255 when only current
    priority queue has tasks. This maybe lead a deadlock same as commit
    dfe1fe75e00e ("NFSv4: Fix deadlock between nfs4_evict_inode()

    the slot, a non-privileged maybe picked out. It maybe allocate slot

    If the 'queue->nr' has wraparound to 255, and no enough slot to
    service it, then the privileged delegreturn will lost to wake up.

    Rather than just indicating that transmission can start, this patch
    requires the explicit flushing of the network TX queue when the driver
    is informed by the device that it can transmit, next to its
    configuration.
    
    In this way, if frames have already been written by the application,
    they will actually be transmitted.

    can: bcm: delay release of struct bcm_op after synchronize_rcu()
    
    commit d5f9023fa61ee8b94f37a93f08e94b136cf1e463 upstream.
    
    can_rx_register() callbacks may be called concurrently to the call to
    can_rx_unregister(). The callbacks and callback data, though, are
    protected by RCU and the struct sock reference count.
    
    So the callback data is really attached to the life of sk, meaning
    that it should be released on sk_destruct. However, bcm_remove_op()
    calls tasklet_kill(), and RCU callbacks may be called under RCU
    softirq, so that cannot be used on kernels before the introduction of
    HRTIMER_MODE_SOFT.
    
    However, bcm_rx_handler() is called under RCU protection, so after
    calling can_rx_unregister(), we may call synchronize_rcu() in order to
    wait for any RCU read-side critical sections to finish. That is,
    bcm_rx_handler() won't be called anymore for those ops. So, we only
    free them, after we do that synchronize_rcu().

    ext4: correct the cache_nr in tracepoint ext4_es_shrink_exit
    
    commit 4fb7c70a889ead2e91e184895ac6e5354b759135 upstream.
    
    The cache_cnt parameter of tracepoint ext4_es_shrink_exit means the
    remaining cache count after shrink, but now it is the cache count before
    shrink, fix it by read sbi->s_extent_cache_cnt again.

    ext4: cleanup in-core orphan list if ext4_truncate() failed to get a transaction handle
    
    commit b9a037b7f3c401d3c63e0423e56aef606b1ffaaf upstream.
    
    In ext4_orphan_cleanup(), if ext4_truncate() failed to get a transaction
    handle, it didn't remove the inode from the in-core orphan list, which
    may probably trigger below error dump in ext4_destroy_inode() during the
    final iput() and could lead to memory corruption on the later orphan
    list changes.
    
     EXT4-fs (sda): Inode 6291467 (00000000b8247c67): orphan list check failed!

    btrfs: clear defrag status of a root if starting transaction fails
    
    commit 6819703f5a365c95488b07066a8744841bf14231 upstream.
    
    The defrag loop processes leaves in batches and starting transaction for
    each. The whole defragmentation on a given root is protected by a bit
    but in case the transaction fails, the bit is not cleared
    
    In case the transaction fails the bit would prevent starting
    defragmentation again, so make sure it's cleared.

    btrfs: send: fix invalid path for unlink operations after parent orphanization
    
    commit d8ac76cdd1755b21e8c008c28d0b7251c0b14986 upstream.
    
    During an incremental send operation, when processing the new references
    for the current inode, we might send an unlink operation for another inode
    that has a conflicting path and has more than one hard link. However this
    path was computed and cached before we processed previous new references
    for the current inode. We may have orphanized a directory of that path
    while processing a previous new reference, in which case the path will
    be invalid and cause the receiver process to fail.
    
    The following reproducer triggers the problem and explains how/why it
    happens in its comments:
    
      $ cat test-send-unlink.sh
      #!/bin/bash
    
      DEV=/dev/sdi
      MNT=/mnt/sdi
    
      mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV >/dev/null
      mount $DEV $MNT
    
      # Create our test files and directory. Inode 259 (file3) has two hard
      # links.
      touch $MNT/file1
      touch $MNT/file2
      touch $MNT/file3
    
      mkdir $MNT/A
      ln $MNT/file3 $MNT/A/hard_link
    
      # Filesystem looks like:
      #
      # .                                     (ino 256)
      # |----- file1                          (ino 257)
      # |----- file2                          (ino 258)
      # |----- file3                          (ino 259)
      # |----- A/                             (ino 260)
      #        |---- hard_link                (ino 259)
      #
    
      # Now create the base snapshot, which is going to be the parent snapshot
      # for a later incremental send.
      btrfs subvolume snapshot -r $MNT $MNT/snap1
      btrfs send -f /tmp/snap1.send $MNT/snap1
    
      # Move inode 257 into directory inode 260. This results in computing the
      # path for inode 260 as "/A" and caching it.
      mv $MNT/file1 $MNT/A/file1
    
      # Move inode 258 (file2) into directory inode 260, with a name of
      # "hard_link", moving first inode 259 away since it currently has that
      # location and name.
      mv $MNT/A/hard_link $MNT/tmp
      mv $MNT/file2 $MNT/A/hard_link
    
      # Now rename inode 260 to something else (B for example) and then create
      # a hard link for inode 258 that has the old name and location of inode
      # 260 ("/A").
      mv $MNT/A $MNT/B
      ln $MNT/B/hard_link $MNT/A
    
      # Filesystem now looks like:
      #

      btrfs subvolume snapshot -r $MNT $MNT/snap2
      btrfs send -f /tmp/snap2.send -p $MNT/snap1 $MNT/snap2
    
      # Now unmount the filesystem, create a new one, mount it and try to

      mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV >/dev/null
    
      mount $DEV $MNT
    
      # First add the first snapshot to the new filesystem by applying the
      # first send stream.
      btrfs receive -f /tmp/snap1.send $MNT
    
      # The incremental receive operation below used to fail with the
      # following error:
      #
      #    ERROR: unlink A/hard_link failed: No such file or directory
      #
      # This is because when send is processing inode 257, it generates the
      # path for inode 260 as "/A", since that inode is its parent in the send
      # snapshot, and caches that path.
      #
      # Later when processing inode 258, it first processes its new reference
      # that has the path of "/A", which results in orphanizing inode 260
      # because there is a a path collision. This results in issuing a rename
      # operation from "/A" to "/o260-6-0".
      #
      # Finally when processing the new reference "B/hard_link" for inode 258,
      # it notices that it collides with inode 259 (not yet processed, because
      # it has a higher inode number), since that inode has the name
      # "hard_link" under the directory inode 260. It also checks that inode
      # 259 has two hardlinks, so it decides to issue a unlink operation for
      # the name "hard_link" for inode 259. However the path passed to the
      # unlink operation is "/A/hard_link", which is incorrect since currently
      # "/A" does not exists, due to the orphanization of inode 260 mentioned
      # before. The path is incorrect because it was computed and cached
      # before the orphanization. This results in the receiver to fail with
      # the above error.
      btrfs receive -f /tmp/snap2.send $MNT
    
      umount $MNT
    
    When running the test, it fails like this:
    
      $ ./test-send-unlink.sh
      Create a readonly snapshot of '/mnt/sdi' in '/mnt/sdi/snap1'
      At subvol /mnt/sdi/snap1
      Create a readonly snapshot of '/mnt/sdi' in '/mnt/sdi/snap2'
      At subvol /mnt/sdi/snap2
      At subvol snap1
      At snapshot snap2
      ERROR: unlink A/hard_link failed: No such file or directory
    
    Fix this by recomputing a path before issuing an unlink operation when
    processing the new references for the current inode if we previously
    have orphanized a directory.
    
    A test case for fstests will follow soon.

    arm_pmu: Fix write counter incorrect in ARMv7 big-endian mode
    
    commit fdbef8c4e68ad423416aa6cc93d1616d6f8ac5b3 upstream.
    
    Commit 3a95200d3f89 ("arm_pmu: Change API to support 64bit counter values")
    changes the input "value" type from 32-bit to 64-bit, which introduces the
    following problem: ARMv7 PMU counters is 32-bit width, in big-endian mode,
    write counter uses high 32-bit, which writes an incorrect value.
    
    Before:
    
     Performance counter stats for 'ls':
    
                  2.22 msec task-clock                #    0.675 CPUs utilized
                     0      context-switches          #    0.000 K/sec
                     0      cpu-migrations            #    0.000 K/sec
                    49      page-faults               #    0.022 M/sec
            2150476593      cycles                    #  966.663 GHz
            2148588788      instructions              #    1.00  insn per cycle
            2147745484      branches                  # 965435.074 M/sec
            2147508540      branch-misses             #   99.99% of all branches
    
    None of the above hw event counters are correct.
    
    Solution:
    
    "value" forcibly converted to 32-bit type before being written to PMU register.
    
    After:
    
     Performance counter stats for 'ls':
    
                  2.09 msec task-clock                #    0.681 CPUs utilized

    Input: joydev - prevent use of not validated data in JSIOCSBTNMAP ioctl
    
    commit f8f84af5da9ee04ef1d271528656dac42a090d00 upstream.
    
    Even though we validate user-provided inputs we then traverse past
    validated data when applying the new map. The issue was originally
    discovered by Murray McAllister with this simple POC (if the following
    is executed by an unprivileged user it will instantly panic the system):
    
    int main(void) {
            int fd, ret;
            unsigned int buffer[10000];
    
            fd = open("/dev/input/js0", O_RDONLY);
            if (fd == -1)
                    printf("Error opening file\n");
    
            ret = ioctl(fd, JSIOCSBTNMAP & ~IOCSIZE_MASK, &buffer);
            printf("%d\n", ret);
    }
    
    The solution is to traverse internal buffer which is guaranteed to only
    contain valid date when constructing the map.

    ntfs: fix validity check for file name attribute
    
    commit d98e4d95411bbde2220a7afa38dcc9c14d71acbe upstream.
    
    When checking the file name attribute, we want to ensure that it fits
    within the bounds of ATTR_RECORD.  To do this, we should check that (attr
    record + file name offset + file name length) < (attr record + attr record
    length).
    
    However, the original check did not include the file name offset in the
    calculation.  This means that corrupted on-disk metadata might not caught
    by the incorrect file name check, and lead to an invalid memory access.
    
    An example can be seen in the crash report of a memory corruption error
    found by Syzbot:
    https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=a1a1e379b225812688566745c3e2f7242bffc246
    
    Adding the file name offset to the validity check fixes this error and
    passes the Syzbot reproducer test.

    xhci: solve a double free problem while doing s4
    
    commit b31d9d6d7abbf6483b871b6370bc31c930d53f54 upstream.
    
    when system is doing s4, the process of xhci_resume may be as below:
    1、xhci_mem_cleanup
    2、xhci_init->xhci_mem_init->xhci_mem_cleanup(when memory is not enough).
    xhci_mem_cleanup will be executed twice when system is out of memory.
    xhci->port_caps is freed in xhci_mem_cleanup,but it isn't set to NULL.
    It will be freed twice when xhci_mem_cleanup is called the second time.
    
    We got following bug when system resumes from s4:

    USB: cdc-acm: blacklist Heimann USB Appset device
    
    commit 4897807753e078655a78de39ed76044d784f3e63 upstream.
    
    The device (32a7:0000 Heimann Sensor GmbH USB appset demo) claims to be
    a CDC-ACM device in its descriptors but in fact is not. If it is run
    with echo disabled it returns garbled data, probably due to something
    that happens in the TTY layer. And when run with echo enabled (the
    default), it will mess up the calibration data of the sensor the first
    time any data is sent to the device.
    
    In short, I had a bad time after connecting the sensor and trying to get
    it to work. I hope blacklisting it in the cdc-acm driver will save
    someone else a bit of trouble.
