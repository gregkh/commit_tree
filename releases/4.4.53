    scsi: lpfc: Correct WQ creation for pagesize
    
    commit 8ea73db486cda442f0671f4bc9c03a76be398a28 upstream.
    
    Correct WQ creation for pagesize
    
    The driver was calculating the adapter command pagesize indicator from
    the system pagesize. However, the buffers the driver allocates are only
    one size (SLI4_PAGE_SIZE), so no calculation was necessary.

    MIPS: IP22: Fix build error due to binutils 2.25 uselessnes.
    
    commit ae2f5e5ed04a17c1aa1f0a3714c725e12c21d2a9 upstream.
    
    Fix the following build error with binutils 2.25.
    
      CC      arch/mips/mm/sc-ip22.o
    {standard input}: Assembler messages:
    {standard input}:132: Error: number (0x9000000080000000) larger than 32 bits

    make[1]: *** [arch/mips/mm/sc-ip22.o] Error 1
    
    MIPS has used .set mips3 to temporarily switch the assembler to 64 bit
    mode in 64 bit kernels virtually forever.  Binutils 2.25 broke this
    behavious partially by happily accepting 64 bit instructions in .set mips3
    mode but puking on 64 bit constants when generating 32 bit ELF.  Binutils
    2.26 restored the old behaviour again.
    
    Fix build with binutils 2.25 by open coding the offending
    
            dli $1, 0x9000000080000000
    
    as
    
            li      $1, 0x9000
            dsll    $1, $1, 48
    
    which is ugly be the only thing that will build on all binutils vintages.

    powerpc/xmon: Fix data-breakpoint
    
    commit c21a493a2b44650707d06741601894329486f2ad upstream.
    
    Currently xmon data-breakpoint feature is broken.
    
    Whenever there is a watchpoint match occurs, hw_breakpoint_handler will
    be called by do_break via notifier chains mechanism. If watchpoint is
    registered by xmon, hw_breakpoint_handler won't find any associated
    perf_event and returns immediately with NOTIFY_STOP. Similarly, do_break
    also returns without notifying to xmon.
    
    Solve this by returning NOTIFY_DONE when hw_breakpoint_handler does not
    find any perf_event associated with matched watchpoint, rather than
    NOTIFY_STOP, which tells the core code to continue calling the other
    breakpoint handlers including the xmon one.

    md linear: fix a race between linear_add() and linear_congested()
    
    commit 03a9e24ef2aaa5f1f9837356aed79c860521407a upstream.
    
    Recently I receive a bug report that on Linux v3.0 based kerenl, hot add
    disk to a md linear device causes kernel crash at linear_congested(). From
    the crash image analysis, I find in linear_congested(), mddev->raid_disks
    contains value N, but conf->disks[] only has N-1 pointers available. Then
    a NULL pointer deference crashes the kernel.
    
    There is a race between linear_add() and linear_congested(), RCU stuffs
    used in these two functions cannot avoid the race. Since Linuv v4.0
    RCU code is replaced by introducing mddev_suspend().  After checking the
    upstream code, it seems linear_congested() is not called in
    generic_make_request() code patch, so mddev_suspend() cannot provent it
    from being called. The possible race still exists.
    
    Here I explain how the race still exists in current code.  For a machine
    has many CPUs, on one CPU, linear_add() is called to add a hard disk to a
    md linear device; at the same time on other CPU, linear_congested() is
    called to detect whether this md linear device is congested before issuing
    an I/O request onto it.
    
    Now I use a possible code execution time sequence to demo how the possible
    race happens,
    
    seq    linear_add()                linear_congested()
     0                                 conf=mddev->private
     1   oldconf=mddev->private
     2   mddev->raid_disks++
     3                              for (i=0; i<mddev->raid_disks;i++)
     4                                bdev_get_queue(conf->disks[i].rdev->bdev)
     5   mddev->private=newconf
    
    In linear_add() mddev->raid_disks is increased in time seq 2, and on
    another CPU in linear_congested() the for-loop iterates conf->disks[i] by
    the increased mddev->raid_disks in time seq 3,4. But conf with one more
    element (which is a pointer to struct dev_info type) to conf->disks[] is
    not updated yet, accessing its structure member in time seq 4 will cause a
    NULL pointer deference fault.
    
    To fix this race, there are 2 parts of modification in the patch,
     1) Add 'int raid_disks' in struct linear_conf, as a copy of
        mddev->raid_disks. It is initialized in linear_conf(), always being
        consistent with pointers number of 'struct dev_info disks[]'. When
        iterating conf->disks[] in linear_congested(), use conf->raid_disks to
        replace mddev->raid_disks in the for-loop, then NULL pointer deference
        will not happen again.
     2) RCU stuffs are back again, and use kfree_rcu() in linear_add() to
        free oldconf memory. Because oldconf may be referenced as mddev->private
        in linear_congested(), kfree_rcu() makes sure that its memory will not
        be released until no one uses it any more.
    Also some code comments are added in this patch, to make this modification
    to be easier understandable.
    
    This patch can be applied for kernels since v4.0 after commit:
    3be260cc18f8 ("md/linear: remove rcu protections in favour of
    suspend/resume"). But this bug is reported on Linux v3.0 based kernel, for
    people who maintain kernels before Linux v4.0, they need to do some back
    back port to this patch.
    
    Changelog:
     - V3: add 'int raid_disks' in struct linear_conf, and use kfree_rcu() to
           replace rcu_call() in linear_add().
     - v2: add RCU stuffs by suggestion from Shaohua and Neil.
     - v1: initial effort.

    rtc: sun6i: Switch to the external oscillator
    
    commit fb61bb82cb46a932ef2fc62e1c731c8e7e6640d5 upstream.
    
    The RTC is clocked from either an internal, imprecise, oscillator or an
    external one, which is usually much more accurate.
    
    The difference perceived between the time elapsed and the time reported by
    the RTC is in a 10% scale, which prevents the RTC from being useful at all.
    
    Fortunately, the external oscillator is reported to be mandatory in the
    Allwinner datasheet, so we can just switch to it.

    nfsd: special case truncates some more
    
    commit 783112f7401ff449d979530209b3f6c2594fdb4e upstream.
    
    Both the NFS protocols and the Linux VFS use a setattr operation with a
    bitmap of attributes to set to set various file attributes including the
    file size and the uid/gid.
    
    The Linux syscalls never mix size updates with unrelated updates like
    the uid/gid, and some file systems like XFS and GFS2 rely on the fact
    that truncates don't update random other attributes, and many other file
    systems handle the case but do not update the other attributes in the
    same transaction.  NFSD on the other hand passes the attributes it gets
    on the wire more or less directly through to the VFS, leading to updates
    the file systems don't expect.  XFS at least has an assert on the
    allowed attributes, which caught an unusual NFS client setting the size
    and group at the same time.
    
    To handle this issue properly this splits the notify_change call in
    nfsd_setattr into two separate ones.

    alignment to access registers.  This change contains the following:
     1. Function _rtl8821ae_dbi_read() is used to read one byte from DBI,
        thus it should use rtl_read_byte().
     2. Register 0x4C7 of 8192ee is single byte.

    RDMA/core: Fix incorrect structure packing for booleans
    
    commit 55efcfcd7776165b294f8b5cd6e05ca00ec89b7c upstream.
    
    The RDMA core uses ib_pack() to convert from unpacked CPU structs
    to on-the-wire bitpacked structs.
    
    This process requires that 1 bit fields are declared as u8 in the
    unpacked struct, otherwise the packing process does not read the
    value properly and the packed result is wired to 0. Several
    places wrongly used int.
    
    Crucially this means the kernel has never, set reversible
    correctly in the path record request. It has always asked for
    irreversible paths even if the ULP requests otherwise.
    
    When the kernel is used with a SM that supports this feature, it
    completely breaks communication management if reversible paths are
    not properly requested.
    
    The only reason this ever worked is because opensm ignores the
    reversible bit.

    w1: ds2490: USB transfer buffers need to be DMAable
    
    commit 61cd1b4cd1e8f7f7642ab64529d9bd52e8374641 upstream.
    
    ds2490 driver was doing USB transfers from / to buffers on a stack.
    This is not permitted and made the driver non-working with vmapped stacks.
    
    Since all these transfers are done under the same bus_mutex lock we can
    simply use shared buffers in a device private structure for two most common
    of them.
    
    While we are at it, let's also fix a comparison between int and size_t in
    ds9490r_search() which made the driver spin in this function if state
    register get requests were failing.

    iio: pressure: mpl3115: do not rely on structure field ordering
    
    commit 9cf6cdba586ced75c69b8314b88b2d2f5ce9b3ed upstream.
    
    Fixes a regression triggered by a change in the layout of
    struct iio_chan_spec, but the real bug is in the driver which assumed
    a specific structure layout in the first place. Hint: the two bits were
    not OR:ed together as implied by the indentation prior to this patch,
    there was a comma between them, which accidentally moved the ..._SCALE
    bit to the next structure field. That field was .info_mask_shared_by_type
    before the _available attributes was added by commit 51239600074b
    ("iio:core: add a callback to allow drivers to provide _available
    attributes") and .info_mask_separate_available afterwards, and the
    regression happened.
    
    info_mask_shared_by_type is actually a better choice than the originally
    intended info_mask_separate for the ..._SCALE bit since a constant is
    returned from mpl3115_read_raw for the scale. Using
    info_mask_shared_by_type also preserves the behavior from before the
    regression and is therefore less likely to cause other interesting side
    effects.
    
    The above mentioned regression causes an unintended sysfs attibute to
    show up that is not backed by code, in turn causing the following NULL
    pointer defererence to happen on access.

    iio: pressure: mpl115: do not rely on structure field ordering
    
    commit 6a6e1d56a0769795a36c0461c64bf5e5b9bbb4c0 upstream.
    
    Fixes a regression triggered by a change in the layout of
    struct iio_chan_spec, but the real bug is in the driver which assumed
    a specific structure layout in the first place. Hint: the three bits were
    not OR:ed together as implied by the indentation prior to this patch,
    there was a comma between the first two, which accidentally moved the
    ..._SCALE and ..._OFFSET bits to the next structure field. That field
    was .info_mask_shared_by_type before the _available attributes was added
    by commit 51239600074b ("iio:core: add a callback to allow drivers to
    provide _available attributes") and .info_mask_separate_available
    afterwards, and the regression happened.
    
    info_mask_shared_by_type is actually a better choice than the originally
    intended info_mask_separate for the ..._SCALE and ..._OFFSET bits since
    a constant is returned from mpl115_read_raw for the scale/offset. Using
    info_mask_shared_by_type also preserves the behavior from before the
    regression and is therefore less likely to cause other interesting side
    effects.
    
    The above mentioned regression causes unintended sysfs attibutes to
    show up that are not backed by code, in turn causing a NULL pointer
    defererence to happen on access.

    arm/arm64: KVM: Enforce unconditional flush to PoC when mapping to stage-2
    
    commit 8f36ebaf21fdae99c091c67e8b6fab33969f2667 upstream.
    
    When we fault in a page, we flush it to the PoC (Point of Coherency)
    if the faulting vcpu has its own caches off, so that it can observe
    the page we just brought it.
    
    But if the vcpu has its caches on, we skip that step. Bad things
    happen when *another* vcpu tries to access that page with its own
    caches disabled. At that point, there is no garantee that the
    data has made it to the PoC, and we access stale data.
    
    The obvious fix is to always flush to PoC when a page is faulted
    in, no matter what the state of the vcpu is.

    fuse_file_put() was missing the "force" flag for the RELEASE request when
    sending synchronously (fuseblk).
    
    If this flag is not set, then a sync request may be interrupted before it

    ath9k: use correct OTP register offsets for the AR9340 and AR9550
    
    commit c9f1e32600816d695f817477d56490bfc2ba43c6 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes the OTP register definitions for the AR934x and AR9550
    WMAC SoC.
    
    Previously, the ath9k driver was unable to initialize the integrated
    WMAC on an Aerohive AP121:
    
    | ath: phy0: timeout (1000 us) on reg 0x30018: 0xbadc0ffe & 0x00000007 != 0x00000004
    | ath: phy0: timeout (1000 us) on reg 0x30018: 0xbadc0ffe & 0x00000007 != 0x00000004
    | ath: phy0: Unable to initialize hardware; initialization status: -5
    | ath9k ar934x_wmac: failed to initialize device
    | ath9k: probe of ar934x_wmac failed with error -5
    
    It turns out that the AR9300_OTP_STATUS and AR9300_OTP_DATA
    definitions contain a typo.

    ath9k: fix race condition in enabling/disabling IRQs
    
    commit 3a5e969bb2f6692a256352649355d56d018d6b88 upstream.
    
    The code currently relies on refcounting to disable IRQs from within the
    IRQ handler and re-enabling them again after the tasklet has run.
    
    However, due to race conditions sometimes the IRQ handler might be
    called twice, or the tasklet may not run at all (if interrupted in the
    middle of a reset).
    
    This can cause nasty imbalances in the irq-disable refcount which will
    get the driver permanently stuck until the entire radio has been stopped
    and started again (ath_reset will not recover from this).
    
    Instead of using this fragile logic, change the code to ensure that
    running the irq handler during tasklet processing is safe, and leave the
    refcount untouched.

    target: Fix multi-session dynamic se_node_acl double free OOPs
    
    commit 01d4d673558985d9a118e1e05026633c3e2ade9b upstream.
    
    This patch addresses a long-standing bug with multi-session
    (eg: iscsi-target + iser-target) se_node_acl dynamic free
    withini transport_deregister_session().
    
    This bug is caused when a storage endpoint is configured with
    demo-mode (generate_node_acls = 1 + cache_dynamic_acls = 1)
    initiators, and initiator login creates a new dynamic node acl
    and attaches two sessions to it.
    
    After that, demo-mode for the storage instance is disabled via
    configfs (generate_node_acls = 0 + cache_dynamic_acls = 0) and
    the existing dynamic acl is never converted to an explicit ACL.
    
    The end result is dynamic acl resources are released twice when
    the sessions are shutdown in transport_deregister_session().
    
    If the storage instance is not changed to disable demo-mode,
    or the dynamic acl is converted to an explict ACL, or there
    is only a single session associated with the dynamic ACL,
    the bug is not triggered.
    
    To address this big, move the release of dynamic se_node_acl
    memory into target_complete_nacl() so it's only freed once
    when se_node_acl->acl_kref reaches zero.
    
    (Drop unnecessary list_del_init usage - HCH)

    target: Obtain se_node_acl->acl_kref during get_initiator_node_acl
    
    commit 21aaa23b0ebbd19334fa461370c03cbb076b3295 upstream.
    
    This patch addresses a long standing race where obtaining
    se_node_acl->acl_kref in __transport_register_session()
    happens a bit too late, and leaves open the potential
    for core_tpg_del_initiator_node_acl() to hit a NULL
    pointer dereference.
    
    Instead, take ->acl_kref in core_tpg_get_initiator_node_acl()
    while se_portal_group->acl_node_mutex is held, and move the
    final target_put_nacl() from transport_deregister_session()
    into transport_free_session() so that fabric driver login
    failure handling using the modern method to still work
    as expected.
    
    Also, update core_tpg_get_initiator_node_acl() to take
    an extra reference for dynamically generated acls for
    demo-mode, before returning to fabric caller.  Also
    update iscsi-target sendtargets special case handling
    to use target_tpg_has_node_acl() when checking if
    demo_mode_discovery == true during discovery lookup.
    
    Note the existing wait_for_completion(&acl->acl_free_comp)
    in core_tpg_del_initiator_node_acl() does not change.

    ext4: do not polute the extents cache while shifting extents
    
    commit 03e916fa8b5577d85471452a3d0c5738aa658dae upstream.
    
    Inside ext4_ext_shift_extents() function ext4_find_extent() is called
    without EXT4_EX_NOCACHE flag, which should prevent cache population.
    
    This leads to oudated offsets in the extents tree and wrong blocks
    afterwards.
    
    Patch fixes the problem providing EXT4_EX_NOCACHE flag for each
    ext4_find_extents() call inside ext4_ext_shift_extents function.

    ext4: Include forgotten start block on fallocate insert range
    
    commit 2a9b8cba62c0741109c33a2be700ff3d7703a7c2 upstream.
    
    While doing 'insert range' start block should be also shifted right.
    The bug can be easily reproduced by the following test:
    
        ptr = malloc(4096);
        assert(ptr);
    
        fd = open("./ext4.file", O_CREAT | O_TRUNC | O_RDWR, 0600);
        assert(fd >= 0);
    
        rc = fallocate(fd, 0, 0, 8192);
        assert(rc == 0);
        for (i = 0; i < 2048; i++)
                *((unsigned short *)ptr + i) = 0xbeef;
        rc = pwrite(fd, ptr, 4096, 0);
        assert(rc == 4096);
        rc = pwrite(fd, ptr, 4096, 4096);
        assert(rc == 4096);
    
        for (block = 2; block < 1000; block++) {
                rc = fallocate(fd, FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE, 4096, 4096);
                assert(rc == 0);
    
                for (i = 0; i < 2048; i++)
                        *((unsigned short *)ptr + i) = block;
    
                rc = pwrite(fd, ptr, 4096, 4096);
                assert(rc == 4096);
        }
    
    Because start block is not included in the range the hole appears at
    the wrong offset (just after the desired offset) and the following
    pwrite() overwrites already existent block, keeping hole untouched.
    
    Simple way to verify wrong behaviour is to check zeroed blocks after
    the test:
    
       $ hexdump ./ext4.file | grep '0000 0000'
    
    The root cause of the bug is a wrong range (start, stop], where start
    should be inclusive, i.e. [start, stop].
    
    This patch fixes the problem by including start into the range.  But
    not to break left shift (range collapse) stop points to the beginning
    of the a block, not to the end.
    
    The other not obvious change is an iterator check on validness in a
    main loop.  Because iterator is unsigned the following corner case
    should be considered with care: insert a block at 0 offset, when stop
    variables overflows and never becomes less than start, which is 0.
    To handle this special case iterator is set to NULL to indicate that
    end of the loop is reached.

    commit 907565337ebf998a68cb5c5b2174ce5e5da065eb upstream.
    
    Userspace applications should be allowed to expect the membarrier system
    call with MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED command to issue memory barriers on
    nohz_full CPUs, but synchronize_sched() does not take those into
    account.
    
    Given that we do not want unrelated processes to be able to affect
    real-time sensitive nohz_full CPUs, simply return ENOSYS when membarrier
    is invoked on a kernel with enabled nohz_full CPUs.

    ipc/shm: Fix shmat mmap nil-page protection
    
    commit 95e91b831f87ac8e1f8ed50c14d709089b4e01b8 upstream.
    
    The issue is described here, with a nice testcase:
    
        https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=192931
    
    The problem is that shmat() calls do_mmap_pgoff() with MAP_FIXED, and
    the address rounded down to 0.  For the regular mmap case, the
    protection mentioned above is that the kernel gets to generate the
    address -- arch_get_unmapped_area() will always check for MAP_FIXED and
    return that address.  So by the time we do security_mmap_addr(0) things
    get funky for shmat().
    
    The testcase itself shows that while a regular user crashes, root will
    not have a problem attaching a nil-page.  There are two possible fixes
    to this.  The first, and which this patch does, is to simply allow root
    to crash as well -- this is also regular mmap behavior, ie when hacking
    up the testcase and adding mmap(...  |MAP_FIXED).  While this approach
    is the safer option, the second alternative is to ignore SHM_RND if the
    rounded address is 0, thus only having MAP_SHARED flags.  This makes the
    behavior of shmat() identical to the mmap() case.  The downside of this
    is obviously user visible, but does make sense in that it maintains
    semantics after the round-down wrt 0 address and mmap.

    mm: do not access page->mapping directly on page_endio
    
    commit dd8416c47715cf324c9a16f13273f9fda87acfed upstream.
    
    With rw_page, page_endio is used for completing IO on a page and it
    propagates write error to the address space if the IO fails.  The
    problem is it accesses page->mapping directly which might be okay for
    file-backed pages but it shouldn't for anonymous page.  Otherwise, it
    can corrupt one of field from anon_vma under us and system goes panic
    randomly.
    
    swap_writepage
      bdev_writepage
        ops->rw_page
    
    I encountered the BUG during developing new zram feature and it was
    really hard to figure it out because it made random crash, somtime
    mmap_sem lockdep, sometime other places where places never related to
    zram/zsmalloc, and not reproducible with some configuration.
    
    When I consider how that bug is subtle and people do fast-swap test with
    brd, it's worth to add stable mark, I think.

    mm: vmpressure: fix sending wrong events on underflow
    
    commit e1587a4945408faa58d0485002c110eb2454740c upstream.
    
    At the end of a window period, if the reclaimed pages is greater than
    scanned, an unsigned underflow can result in a huge pressure value and
    thus a critical event.  Reclaimed pages is found to go higher than
    scanned because of the addition of reclaimed slab pages to reclaimed in
    shrink_node without a corresponding increment to scanned pages.
    
    Minchan Kim mentioned that this can also happen in the case of a THP
    page where the scanned is 1 and reclaimed could be 512.

    mm/page_alloc: fix nodes for reclaim in fast path
    
    commit e02dc017c3032dcdce1b993af0db135462e1b4b7 upstream.
    
    When @node_reclaim_node isn't 0, the page allocator tries to reclaim
    pages if the amount of free memory in the zones are below the low
    watermark.  On Power platform, none of NUMA nodes are scanned for page
    reclaim because no nodes match the condition in zone_allows_reclaim().
    On Power platform, RECLAIM_DISTANCE is set to 10 which is the distance
    of Node-A to Node-A.  So the preferred node even won't be scanned for
    page reclaim.
    
       __alloc_pages_nodemask()
       get_page_from_freelist()
          zone_allows_reclaim()
    
    Anton proposed the test code as below:
    
       # cat alloc.c
          :
       int main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
            void *p;
            unsigned long size;
            unsigned long start, end;
    
            start = time(NULL);
            size = strtoul(argv[1], NULL, 0);
            printf("To allocate %ldGB memory\n", size);
    
            size <<= 30;
            p = malloc(size);
            assert(p);
            memset(p, 0, size);
    
            end = time(NULL);
            printf("Used time: %ld seconds\n", end - start);
            sleep(3600);
            return 0;
       }
    
    The system I use for testing has two NUMA nodes.  Both have 128GB
    memory.  In below scnario, the page caches on node#0 should be reclaimed
    when it encounters pressure to accommodate request of allocation.
    
       # echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode; \
         sync; \
         echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; \
       # taskset -c 0 cat file.32G > /dev/null; \
         grep FilePages /sys/devices/system/node/node0/meminfo
         Node 0 FilePages:       33619712 kB
       # taskset -c 0 ./alloc 128
       # grep FilePages /sys/devices/system/node/node0/meminfo
         Node 0 FilePages:       33619840 kB
       # grep MemFree /sys/devices/system/node/node0/meminfo
         Node 0 MemFree:          186816 kB
    
    With the patch applied, the pagecache on node-0 is reclaimed when its
    free memory is running out.  It's the expected behaviour.
    
       # echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode; \
         sync; \
         echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
       # taskset -c 0 cat file.32G > /dev/null; \
         grep FilePages /sys/devices/system/node/node0/meminfo
         Node 0 FilePages:       33605568 kB
       # taskset -c 0 ./alloc 128
       # grep FilePages /sys/devices/system/node/node0/meminfo
         Node 0 FilePages:        1379520 kB
       # grep MemFree /sys/devices/system/node/node0/meminfo
         Node 0 MemFree:           317120 kB

    staging: rtl: fix possible NULL pointer dereference
    
    commit 6e017006022abfea5d2466cad936065f45763ad1 upstream.
    
    gcc-7 detects that wlanhdr_to_ethhdr() in two drivers calls memcpy() with
    a destination argument that an earlier function call may have set to NULL:
    
    staging/rtl8188eu/core/rtw_recv.c: In function 'wlanhdr_to_ethhdr':
    staging/rtl8188eu/core/rtw_recv.c:1318:2: warning: argument 1 null where non-null expected [-Wnonnull]
    staging/rtl8712/rtl871x_recv.c: In function 'r8712_wlanhdr_to_ethhdr':
    staging/rtl8712/rtl871x_recv.c:649:2: warning: argument 1 null where non-null expected [-Wnonnull]
    
    I'm fixing this by adding a NULL pointer check and returning failure
    from the function, which is hopefully already handled properly.
    
    This seems to date back to when the drivers were originally added,
    so backporting the fix to stable seems appropriate. There are other
    related realtek drivers in the kernel, but none of them contain a
    function with a similar name or produce this warning.

    ALSA: seq: Fix link corruption by event error handling
    
    commit f3ac9f737603da80c2da3e84b89e74429836bb6d upstream.
    
    The sequencer FIFO management has a bug that may lead to a corruption
    (shortage) of the cell linked list.  When a sequencer client faces an
    error at the event delivery, it tries to put back the dequeued cell.
    When the first queue was put back, this forgot the tail pointer
    tracking, and the link will be screwed up.
    
    Although there is no memory corruption, the sequencer client may stall
    forever at exit while flushing the pending FIFO cells in
    snd_seq_pool_done(), as spotted by syzkaller.
    
    This patch addresses the missing tail pointer tracking at
    snd_seq_fifo_cell_putback().  Also the patch makes sure to clear the
    cell->enxt pointer at snd_seq_fifo_event_in() for avoiding a similar
    mess-up of the FIFO linked list.

    ALSA: timer: Reject user params with too small ticks
    
    commit 71321eb3f2d0df4e6c327e0b936eec4458a12054 upstream.
    
    When a user sets a too small ticks with a fine-grained timer like
    hrtimer, the kernel tries to fire up the timer irq too frequently.
    This may lead to the condensed locks, eventually the kernel spinlock
    lockup with warnings.
    
    For avoiding such a situation, we define a lower limit of the
    resolution, namely 1ms.  When the user passes a too small tick value
    that results in less than that, the kernel returns -EINVAL now.

    MIPS: Calculate microMIPS ra properly when unwinding the stack
    
    commit bb9bc4689b9c635714fbcd5d335bad9934a7ebfc upstream.
    
    get_frame_info() calculates the offset of the return address within a
    stack frame simply by dividing a the bottom 16 bits of the instruction,
    treated as a signed integer, by the size of a long. Whilst this works
    for MIPS32 & MIPS64 ISAs where the sw or sd instructions are used, it's
    incorrect for microMIPS where encodings differ. The result is that we
    typically completely fail to unwind the stack on microMIPS.
    
    Fix this by adjusting is_ra_save_ins() to calculate the return address
    offset, and take into account the various different encodings there in
    the same place as we consider whether an instruction is storing the
    ra/$31 register.
    
    With this we are now able to unwind the stack for kernels targetting the
    microMIPS ISA, for example we can produce:

    MIPS: Fix get_frame_info() handling of microMIPS function size
    
    commit b6c7a324df37bf05ef7a2c1580683cf10d082d97 upstream.
    
    get_frame_info() is meant to iterate over up to the first 128
    instructions within a function, but for microMIPS kernels it will not
    reach that many instructions unless the function is 512 bytes long since
    we calculate the maximum number of instructions to check by dividing the
    function length by the 4 byte size of a union mips_instruction. In
    microMIPS kernels this won't do since instructions are variable length.
    
    Fix this by instead checking whether the pointer to the current
    instruction has reached the end of the function, and use max_insns as a
    simple constant to check the number of iterations against.

    MIPS: Prevent unaligned accesses during stack unwinding
    
    commit a3552dace7d1d0cabf573e88fc3025cb90c4a601 upstream.
    
    During stack unwinding we call a number of functions to determine what
    type of instruction we're looking at. The union mips_instruction pointer
    provided to them may be pointing at a 2 byte, but not 4 byte, aligned
    address & we thus cannot directly access the 4 byte wide members of the
    union mips_instruction. To avoid this is_ra_save_ins() copies the
    required half-words of the microMIPS instruction to a correctly aligned
    union mips_instruction on the stack, which it can then access safely.
    The is_jump_ins() & is_sp_move_ins() functions do not correctly perform
    this temporary copy, and instead attempt to directly dereference 4 byte
    fields which may be misaligned and lead to an address exception.
    
    Fix this by copying the instruction halfwords to a temporary union
    mips_instruction in get_frame_info() such that we can provide a 4 byte
    aligned union mips_instruction to the is_*_ins() functions and they do
    not need to deal with misalignment themselves.

    MIPS: Clear ISA bit correctly in get_frame_info()
    
    commit ccaf7caf2c73c6db920772bf08bf1d47b2170634 upstream.
    
    get_frame_info() can be called in microMIPS kernels with the ISA bit
    already clear. For example this happens when unwind_stack_by_address()
    is called because we begin with a PC that has the ISA bit set & subtract
    the (odd) offset from the preceding symbol (which does not have the ISA
    bit set). Since get_frame_info() unconditionally subtracts 1 from the PC
    in microMIPS kernels it incorrectly misaligns the address it then
    attempts to access code at, leading to an address error exception.
    
    Fix this by using msk_isa16_mode() to clear the ISA bit, which allows
    get_frame_info() to function regardless of whether it is provided with a
    PC that has the ISA bit set or not.

    MIPS: Lantiq: Keep ethernet enabled during boot
    
    commit 774f0c6419bb8f9d83901d33582c7fe3ba6a6cb3 upstream.
    
    Disabling ethernet during reboot (only to enable it again when the
    ethernet driver attaches) can put the chip into a faulty state where it
    corrupts the header of all incoming packets.
    
    This happens if packets arrive during the time window where the core is
    disabled, and it can be easily reproduced by rebooting while sending a
    flood ping to the broadcast address.

    MIPS: OCTEON: Fix copy_from_user fault handling for large buffers
    
    commit 884b426917e4b3c85f33b382c792a94305dfdd62 upstream.
    
    If copy_from_user is called with a large buffer (>= 128 bytes) and the
    userspace buffer refers partially to unreadable memory, then it is
    possible for Octeon's copy_from_user to report the wrong number of bytes
    have been copied. In the case where the buffer size is an exact multiple
    of 128 and the fault occurs in the last 64 bytes, copy_from_user will
    report that all the bytes were copied successfully but leave some
    garbage in the destination buffer.
    
    The bug is in the main __copy_user_common loop in octeon-memcpy.S where
    in the middle of the loop, src and dst are incremented by 128 bytes. The
    l_exc_copy fault handler is used after this but that assumes that
    "src < THREAD_BUADDR($28)". This is not the case if src has already been
    incremented.
    
    Fix by adding an extra fault handler which rewinds the src and dst
    pointers 128 bytes before falling though to l_exc_copy.
    
    Thanks to the pwritev test from the strace test suite for originally
    highlighting this bug!
