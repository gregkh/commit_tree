    NFC: fix attrs checks in netlink interface
    
    commit 18917d51472fe3b126a3a8f756c6b18085eb8130 upstream.
    
    nfc_genl_deactivate_target() relies on the NFC_ATTR_TARGET_INDEX
    attribute being present, but doesn't check whether it is actually
    provided by the user. Same goes for nfc_genl_fw_download() and
    NFC_ATTR_FIRMWARE_NAME.
    
    This patch adds appropriate checks.

    smack: use GFP_NOFS while holding inode_smack::smk_lock
    
    commit e5bfad3d7acc5702f32aafeb388362994f4d7bd0 upstream.
    
    inode_smack::smk_lock is taken during smack_d_instantiate(), which is
    called during a filesystem transaction when creating a file on ext4.
    Therefore to avoid a deadlock, all code that takes this lock must use
    GFP_NOFS, to prevent memory reclaim from waiting for the filesystem
    transaction to complete.

    Smack: Don't ignore other bprm->unsafe flags if LSM_UNSAFE_PTRACE is set
    
    commit 3675f052b43ba51b99b85b073c7070e083f3e6fb upstream.
    
    There is a logic bug in the current smack_bprm_set_creds():
    If LSM_UNSAFE_PTRACE is set, but the ptrace state is deemed to be
    acceptable (e.g. because the ptracer detached in the meantime), the other
    ->unsafe flags aren't checked. As far as I can tell, this means that
    something like the following could work (but I haven't tested it):
    
     - task A: create task B with fork()
     - task B: set NO_NEW_PRIVS
     - task B: install a seccomp filter that makes open() return 0 under some
       conditions
     - task B: replace fd 0 with a malicious library
     - task A: attach to task B with PTRACE_ATTACH
     - task B: execve() a file with an SMACK64EXEC extended attribute
     - task A: while task B is still in the middle of execve(), exit (which
       destroys the ptrace relationship)
    
    Make sure that if any flags other than LSM_UNSAFE_PTRACE are set in
    bprm->unsafe, we reject the execve().

    addrconf_dad_work is kicked to be scheduled when a device is brought
    up. There is a race between addrcond_dad_work getting scheduled and
    taking the rtnl lock and a process taking the link down (under rtnl).
    The latter removes the host route from the inet6_addr as part of
    addrconf_ifdown which is run for NETDEV_DOWN. The former attempts
    to use the host route in __ipv6_ifa_notify. If the down event removes
    the host route due to the race to the rtnl, then the BUG listed above
    occurs.
    
    Since the DAD sequence can not be aborted, add a check for the missing
    host route in __ipv6_ifa_notify. The only way this should happen is due
    to the previously mentioned race. The host route is created when the
    address is added to an interface; it is only removed on a down event
    where the address is kept. Add a warning if the host route is missing
    AND the device is up; this is a situation that should never happen.

    xen-netfront: do not use ~0U as error return value for xennet_fill_frags()
    
    [ Upstream commit a761129e3625688310aecf26e1be9e98e85f8eb5 ]
    
    xennet_fill_frags() uses ~0U as return value when the sk_buff is not able
    to cache extra fragments. This is incorrect because the return type of
    xennet_fill_frags() is RING_IDX and 0xffffffff is an expected value for
    ring buffer index.
    
    In the situation when the rsp_cons is approaching 0xffffffff, the return
    value of xennet_fill_frags() may become 0xffffffff which xennet_poll() (the
    caller) would regard as error. As a result, queue->rx.rsp_cons is set
    incorrectly because it is updated only when there is error. If there is no
    error, xennet_poll() would be responsible to update queue->rx.rsp_cons.
    Finally, queue->rx.rsp_cons would point to the rx ring buffer entries whose
    queue->rx_skbs[i] and queue->grant_rx_ref[i] are already cleared to NULL.
    This leads to NULL pointer access in the next iteration to process rx ring
    buffer entries.
    
    The symptom is similar to the one fixed in
    commit 00b368502d18 ("xen-netfront: do not assume sk_buff_head list is
    empty in error handling").
    
    This patch changes the return type of xennet_fill_frags() to indicate
    whether it is successful or failed. The queue->rx.rsp_cons will be
    always updated inside this function.

    rds_ibdev:ipaddr_list and rds_ibdev:conn_list are initialized
    after allocation some resources such as protection domain.
    If allocation of such resources fail, then these uninitialized
    variables are accessed in rds_ib_dev_free() in failure path. This
    can potentially crash the system. The code has been updated to
    initialize these variables very early in the function.

    net: Unpublish sk from sk_reuseport_cb before call_rcu
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c7138b33e5c690c308b2a7085f6313fdcb3f616 ]
    
    The "reuse->sock[]" array is shared by multiple sockets.  The going away
    sk must unpublish itself from "reuse->sock[]" before making call_rcu()
    call.  However, this unpublish-action is currently done after a grace
    period and it may cause use-after-free.
    
    The fix is to move reuseport_detach_sock() to sk_destruct().
    Due to the above reason, any socket with sk_reuseport_cb has
    to go through the rcu grace period before freeing it.
    
    It is a rather old bug (~3 yrs).  The Fixes tag is not necessary
    the right commit but it is the one that introduced the SOCK_RCU_FREE
    logic and this fix is depending on it.

    net: ipv4: avoid mixed n_redirects and rate_tokens usage
    
    [ Upstream commit b406472b5ad79ede8d10077f0c8f05505ace8b6d ]
    
    Since commit c09551c6ff7f ("net: ipv4: use a dedicated counter
    for icmp_v4 redirect packets") we use 'n_redirects' to account
    for redirect packets, but we still use 'rate_tokens' to compute
    the redirect packets exponential backoff.
    
    If the device sent to the relevant peer any ICMP error packet
    after sending a redirect, it will also update 'rate_token' according
    to the leaking bucket schema; typically 'rate_token' will raise
    above BITS_PER_LONG and the redirect packets backoff algorithm
    will produce undefined behavior.
    
    Fix the issue using 'n_redirects' to compute the exponential backoff
    in ip_rt_send_redirect().
    
    Note that we still clear rate_tokens after a redirect silence period,
    to avoid changing an established behaviour.
    
    The root cause predates git history; before the mentioned commit in
    the critical scenario, the kernel stopped sending redirects, after
    the mentioned commit the behavior more randomic.

    ipv6: drop incoming packets having a v4mapped source address
    
    [ Upstream commit 6af1799aaf3f1bc8defedddfa00df3192445bbf3 ]
    
    This began with a syzbot report. syzkaller was injecting
    IPv6 TCP SYN packets having a v4mapped source address.
    
    After an unsuccessful 4-tuple lookup, TCP creates a request
    socket (SYN_RECV) and calls reqsk_queue_hash_req()
    
    reqsk_queue_hash_req() calls sk_ehashfn(sk)
    
    At this point we have AF_INET6 sockets, and the heuristic
    used by sk_ehashfn() to either hash the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
    is to use ipv6_addr_v4mapped(&sk->sk_v6_daddr)
    
    For the particular spoofed packet, we end up hashing V4 addresses
    which were not initialized by the TCP IPv6 stack, so KMSAN fired
    a warning.
    
    I first fixed sk_ehashfn() to test both source and destination addresses,
    but then faced various problems, including user-space programs
    like packetdrill that had similar assumptions.
    
    Instead of trying to fix the whole ecosystem, it is better
    to admit that we have a dual stack behavior, and that we
    can not build linux kernels without V4 stack anyway.
    
    The dual stack API automatically forces the traffic to be IPv4
    if v4mapped addresses are used at bind() or connect(), so it makes
    no sense to allow IPv6 traffic to use the same v4mapped class.

    ANDROID: binder: remove waitqueue when thread exits.
    
    commit f5cb779ba16334b45ba8946d6bfa6d9834d1527f upstream.
    
    binder_poll() passes the thread->wait waitqueue that
    can be slept on for work. When a thread that uses
    epoll explicitly exits using BINDER_THREAD_EXIT,
    the waitqueue is freed, but it is never removed
    from the corresponding epoll data structure. When
    the process subsequently exits, the epoll cleanup
    code tries to access the waitlist, which results in
    a use-after-free.
    
    Prevent this by using POLLFREE when the thread exits.

    kmemleak: increase DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_EARLY_LOG_SIZE default to 16K
    
    [ Upstream commit b751c52bb587ae66f773b15204ef7a147467f4c7 ]
    
    The current default value (400) is too low on many systems (e.g.  some
    ARM64 platform takes up 1000+ entries).
    
    syzbot uses 16000 as default value, and has proved to be enough on beefy
    configurations, so let's pick that value.
    
    This consumes more RAM on boot (each entry is 160 bytes, so in total
    ~2.5MB of RAM), but the memory would later be freed (early_log is
    __initdata).

    [ Upstream commit 0a3775e4f883912944481cf2ef36eb6383a9cc74 ]
    
    There is a scenario causing ocfs2 umount hang when multiple hosts are
    rebooting at the same time.
    
    NODE1                           NODE2               NODE3
    send unlock requset to NODE2
                                    dies
                                                        become recovery master
                                                        recover NODE2
    find NODE2 dead
    mark resource RECOVERING
    directly remove lock from grant list
    calculate usage but RECOVERING marked
    **miss the window of purging
    clear RECOVERING
    
    To reproduce this issue, crash a host and then umount ocfs2
    from another node.
    
    To solve this, just let unlock progress wait for recovery done.

    hypfs: Fix error number left in struct pointer member
    
    [ Upstream commit b54c64f7adeb241423cd46598f458b5486b0375e ]
    
    In hypfs_fill_super(), if hypfs_create_update_file() fails,
    sbi->update_file is left holding an error number.  This is passed to

    fat: work around race with userspace's read via blockdev while mounting
    
    [ Upstream commit 07bfa4415ab607e459b69bd86aa7e7602ce10b4f ]
    
    If userspace reads the buffer via blockdev while mounting,
    sb_getblk()+modify can race with buffer read via blockdev.
    
    For example,
    
                FS                               userspace
        bh = sb_getblk()
        modify bh->b_data
                                      read
                                        ll_rw_block(bh)
                                          fill bh->b_data by on-disk data
                                          /* lost modified data by FS */
                                          set_buffer_uptodate(bh)
        set_buffer_uptodate(bh)
    
    Userspace should not use the blockdev while mounting though, the udev
    seems to be already doing this.  Although I think the udev should try to
    avoid this, workaround the race by small overhead.

    ARM: 8903/1: ensure that usable memory in bank 0 starts from a PMD-aligned address
    
    [ Upstream commit 00d2ec1e6bd82c0538e6dd3e4a4040de93ba4fef ]
    
    The calculation of memblock_limit in adjust_lowmem_bounds() assumes that
    bank 0 starts from a PMD-aligned address. However, the beginning of the
    first bank may be NOMAP memory and the start of usable memory
    will be not aligned to PMD boundary. In such case the memblock_limit will
    be set to the end of the NOMAP region, which will prevent any memblock
    allocations.
    
    Mark the region between the end of the NOMAP area and the next PMD-aligned
    address as NOMAP as well, so that the usable memory will start at
    PMD-aligned address.

    security: smack: Fix possible null-pointer dereferences in smack_socket_sock_rcv_skb()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f4287e7d98a2954f20bf96c567fdffcd2b63eb9 ]
    
    In smack_socket_sock_rcv_skb(), there is an if statement
    on line 3920 to check whether skb is NULL:
        if (skb && skb->secmark != 0)
    
    This check indicates skb can be NULL in some cases.
    
    But on lines 3931 and 3932, skb is used:
        ad.a.u.net->netif = skb->skb_iif;
        ipv6_skb_to_auditdata(skb, &ad.a, NULL);
    
    Thus, possible null-pointer dereferences may occur when skb is NULL.
    
    To fix these possible bugs, an if statement is added to check skb.
    
    These bugs are found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.

    HID: apple: Fix stuck function keys when using FN
    
    [ Upstream commit aec256d0ecd561036f188dbc8fa7924c47a9edfd ]
    
    This fixes an issue in which key down events for function keys would be
    repeatedly emitted even after the user has raised the physical key. For
    example, the driver fails to emit the F5 key up event when going through
    the following steps:
    - fnmode=1: hold FN, hold F5, release FN, release F5
    - fnmode=2: hold F5, hold FN, release F5, release FN
    
    The repeated F5 key down events can be easily verified using xev.

    ARM: 8898/1: mm: Don't treat faults reported from cache maintenance as writes
    
    [ Upstream commit 834020366da9ab3fb87d1eb9a3160eb22dbed63a ]
    
    Translation faults arising from cache maintenance instructions are
    rather unhelpfully reported with an FSR value where the WnR field is set
    to 1, indicating that the faulting access was a write. Since cache
    maintenance instructions on 32-bit ARM do not require any particular
    permissions, this can cause our private 'cacheflush' system call to fail
    spuriously if a translation fault is generated due to page aging when
    targetting a read-only VMA.
    
    In this situation, we will return -EFAULT to userspace, although this is
    unfortunately suppressed by the popular '__builtin___clear_cache()'
    intrinsic provided by GCC, which returns void.
    
    Although it's tempting to write this off as a userspace issue, we can
    actually do a little bit better on CPUs that support LPAE, even if the
    short-descriptor format is in use. On these CPUs, cache maintenance
    faults additionally set the CM field in the FSR, which we can use to
    suppress the write permission checks in the page fault handler and
    succeed in performing cache maintenance to read-only areas even in the
    presence of a translation fault.

    PCI: tegra: Fix OF node reference leak
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e38e690ace3e7a22a81fc02652fc101efb340cf ]
    
    Each iteration of for_each_child_of_node() executes of_node_put() on the
    previous node, but in some return paths in the middle of the loop
    of_node_put() is missing thus causing a reference leak.
    
    Hence stash these mid-loop return values in a variable 'err' and add a
    new label err_node_put which executes of_node_put() on the previous node
    and returns 'err' on failure.
    
    Change mid-loop return statements to point to jump to this label to
    fix the reference leak.

    mfd: intel-lpss: Remove D3cold delay
    
    [ Upstream commit 76380a607ba0b28627c9b4b55cd47a079a59624b ]
    
    Goodix touchpad may drop its first couple input events when
    i2c-designware-platdrv and intel-lpss it connects to took too long to
    runtime resume from runtime suspended state.
    
    This issue happens becuase the touchpad has a rather small buffer to
    store up to 13 input events, so if the host doesn't read those events in
    time (i.e. runtime resume takes too long), events are dropped from the
    touchpad's buffer.
    
    The bottleneck is D3cold delay it waits when transitioning from D3cold
    to D0, hence remove the delay to make the resume faster. I've tested
    some systems with intel-lpss and haven't seen any regression.

    [ Upstream commit 69a6bcde7fd3fe6f3268ce26f31d9d9378384c98 ]
    
    Selecting the right parent for the main clock is done using only
    main oscillator enabled bit.
    In case we have this oscillator bypassed by an external signal (no driving
    on the XOUT line), we still use external clock, but with BYPASS bit set.
    So, in this case we must select the same parent as before.
    Create a macro that will select the right parent considering both bits from
    the MOR register.
    Use this macro when looking for the right parent.

    prep_irq_for_idle() is intended to be called before entering

    this include:
    
    * Dropped IPIs in the time immediately after a cpu comes
      online (before it has installed the cpuidle handler), making the
      online operation block indefinitely waiting for the new cpu to
      respond.
    
    * Hitting this WARN_ON in arch_local_irq_restore():
            /*
             * We should already be hard disabled here. We had bugs
             * where that wasn't the case so let's dbl check it and

    CFAR does not get restored by the windup code, so that will be wrong

    pinctrl: tegra: Fix write barrier placement in pmx_writel
    
    [ Upstream commit c2cf351eba2ff6002ce8eb178452219d2521e38e ]
    
    pmx_writel uses writel which inserts write barrier before the
    register write.
    
    This patch has fix to replace writel with writel_relaxed followed
    by a readback and memory barrier to ensure write operation is
    completed for successful pinctrl change.

    powerpc/pseries/mobility: use cond_resched when updating device tree
    
    [ Upstream commit ccfb5bd71d3d1228090a8633800ae7cdf42a94ac ]
    
    After a partition migration, pseries_devicetree_update() processes
    changes to the device tree communicated from the platform to
    Linux. This is a relatively heavyweight operation, with multiple
    device tree searches, memory allocations, and conversations with
    partition firmware.
    
    There's a few levels of nested loops which are bounded only by
    decisions made by the platform, outside of Linux's control, and indeed
    we have seen RCU stalls on large systems while executing this call
    graph. Use cond_resched() in these loops so that the cpu is yielded
    when needed.

    powerpc/futex: Fix warning: 'oldval' may be used uninitialized in this function
    
    [ Upstream commit 38a0d0cdb46d3f91534e5b9839ec2d67be14c59d ]
    
    We see warnings such as:
      kernel/futex.c: In function 'do_futex':
      kernel/futex.c:1676:17: warning: 'oldval' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
         return oldval == cmparg;
                       ^
      kernel/futex.c:1651:6: note: 'oldval' was declared here
        int oldval, ret;
            ^
    
    This is because arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser() only sets *oval if ret
    is 0 and GCC doesn't see that it will only use it when ret is 0.
    
    Anyway, the non-zero ret path is an error path that won't suffer from
    setting *oval, and as *oval is a local var in futex_atomic_op_inuser()
    it will have no impact.

    powerpc/rtas: use device model APIs and serialization during LPM
    
    [ Upstream commit a6717c01ddc259f6f73364779df058e2c67309f8 ]
    
    The LPAR migration implementation and userspace-initiated cpu hotplug
    can interleave their executions like so:
    
    1. Set cpu 7 offline via sysfs.
    
    2. Begin a partition migration, whose implementation requires the OS
       to ensure all present cpus are online; cpu 7 is onlined:
    
         rtas_ibm_suspend_me -> rtas_online_cpus_mask -> cpu_up
    
       This sets cpu 7 online in all respects except for the cpu's
       corresponding struct device; dev->offline remains true.
    
    3. Set cpu 7 online via sysfs. _cpu_up() determines that cpu 7 is
       already online and returns success. The driver core (device_online)
       sets dev->offline = false.
    
    4. The migration completes and restores cpu 7 to offline state:
    
         rtas_ibm_suspend_me -> rtas_offline_cpus_mask -> cpu_down
    
    This leaves cpu7 in a state where the driver core considers the cpu
    device online, but in all other respects it is offline and
    unused. Attempts to online the cpu via sysfs appear to succeed but the
    driver core actually does not pass the request to the lower-level
    cpuhp support code. This makes the cpu unusable until the cpu device
    is manually set offline and then online again via sysfs.
    
    Instead of directly calling cpu_up/cpu_down, the migration code should
    use the higher-level device core APIs to maintain consistent state and
    serialize operations.

    ipmi_si: Only schedule continuously in the thread in maintenance mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 340ff31ab00bca5c15915e70ad9ada3030c98cf8 ]
    
    ipmi_thread() uses back-to-back schedule() to poll for command
    completion which, on some machines, can push up CPU consumption and
    heavily tax the scheduler locks leading to noticeable overall
    performance degradation.
    
    This was originally added so firmware updates through IPMI would
    complete in a timely manner.  But we can't kill the scheduler
    locks for that one use case.
    
    Instead, only run schedule() continuously in maintenance mode,
    where firmware updates should run.

    gpu: drm: radeon: Fix a possible null-pointer dereference in radeon_connector_set_property()
    
    [ Upstream commit f3eb9b8f67bc28783eddc142ad805ebdc53d6339 ]
    
    In radeon_connector_set_property(), there is an if statement on line 743
    to check whether connector->encoder is NULL:
        if (connector->encoder)
    
    When connector->encoder is NULL, it is used on line 755:
        if (connector->encoder->crtc)
    
    Thus, a possible null-pointer dereference may occur.
    
    To fix this bug, connector->encoder is checked before being used.
    
    This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.

    drm/bridge: tc358767: Increase AUX transfer length limit
    
    [ Upstream commit e0655feaec62d5139b6b13a7b1bbb1ab8f1c2d83 ]
    
    According to the datasheet tc358767 can transfer up to 16 bytes via
    its AUX channel, so the artificial limit of 8 appears to be too
    low. However only up to 15-bytes seem to be actually supported and
    trying to use 16-byte transfers results in transfers failing
    sporadically (with bogus status in case of I2C transfers), so limit it
    to 15.
