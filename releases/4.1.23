    tcp_cubic: do not set epoch_start in the future
    
    [ Upstream commit c2e7204d180f8efc80f27959ca9cf16fa17f67db ]
    
    Tracking idle time in bictcp_cwnd_event() is imprecise, as epoch_start
    is normally set at ACK processing time, not at send time.
    
    Doing a proper fix would need to add an additional state variable,
    and does not seem worth the trouble, given CUBIC bug has been there
    forever before Jana noticed it.
    
    Let's simply not set epoch_start in the future, otherwise
    bictcp_update() could overflow and CUBIC would again
    grow cwnd too fast.
    
    This was detected thanks to a packetdrill test Neal wrote that was flaky
    before applying this fix.

    tcp_cubic: better follow cubic curve after idle period
    
    [ Upstream commit 30927520dbae297182990bb21d08762bcc35ce1d ]
    
    Jana Iyengar found an interesting issue on CUBIC :
    
    The epoch is only updated/reset initially and when experiencing losses.
    The delta "t" of now - epoch_start can be arbitrary large after app idle
    as well as the bic_target. Consequentially the slope (inverse of
    ca->cnt) would be really large, and eventually ca->cnt would be
    lower-bounded in the end to 2 to have delayed-ACK slow-start behavior.
    
    This particularly shows up when slow_start_after_idle is disabled
    as a dangerous cwnd inflation (1.5 x RTT) after few seconds of idle
    time.
    
    Jana initial fix was to reset epoch_start if app limited,
    but Neal pointed out it would ask the CUBIC algorithm to recalculate the
    curve so that we again start growing steeply upward from where cwnd is
    now (as CUBIC does just after a loss). Ideally we'd want the cwnd growth
    curve to be the same shape, just shifted later in time by the amount of
    the idle period.

    xhci: fix 10 second timeout on removal of PCI hotpluggable xhci controllers
    
    [ Upstream commit 98d74f9ceaefc2b6c4a6440050163a83be0abede ]
    
    PCI hotpluggable xhci controllers such as some Alpine Ridge solutions will
    remove the xhci controller from the PCI bus when the last USB device is
    disconnected.
    
    Add a flag to indicate that the host is being removed to avoid queueing
    configure_endpoint commands for the dropped endpoints.
    For PCI hotplugged controllers this will prevent 5 second command timeouts
    For static xhci controllers the configure_endpoint command is not needed
    in the removal case as everything will be returned, freed, and the
    controller is reset.
    
    For now the flag is only set for PCI connected host controllers.

    usb: xhci: fix xhci locking up during hcd remove
    
    [ Upstream commit ad6b1d914a9e07f3b9a9ae3396f3c840d0070539 ]
    
    The problem seems to be that if a new device is detected
    while we have already removed the shared HCD, then many of the
    xhci operations (e.g.  xhci_alloc_dev(), xhci_setup_device())
    hang as command never completes.
    
    I don't think XHCI can operate without the shared HCD as we've
    already called xhci_halt() in xhci_only_stop_hcd() when shared HCD
    goes away. We need to prevent new commands from being queued
    not only when HCD is dying but also when HCD is halted.
    
    The following lockup was detected while testing the otg state
    machine.

    usb: host: xhci: add a new quirk XHCI_NO_64BIT_SUPPORT
    
    [ Upstream commit 0a380be8233dbf8dd20795b801c5d5d5ef3992f7 ]
    
    On some xHCI controllers (e.g. R-Car SoCs), the AC64 bit (bit 0) of
    HCCPARAMS1 is set to 1. However, the xHCs don't support 64-bit
    address memory pointers actually. So, in this case, this driver should
    call dma_set_coherent_mask(dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(32)) in xhci_gen_setup().
    Otherwise, the xHCI controller will be died after a usb device is
    connected if it runs on above 4GB physical memory environment.
    
    So, this patch adds a new quirk XHCI_NO_64BIT_SUPPORT to resolve
    such an issue.

    lib: lz4: fixed zram with lz4 on big endian machines
    
    [ Upstream commit 3e26a691fe3fe1e02a76e5bab0c143ace4b137b4 ]
    
    Based on Sergey's test patch [1], this fixes zram with lz4 compression
    on big endian cpus.
    
    Note that the 64-bit preprocessor test is not a cleanup, it's part of
    the fix, since those identifiers are bogus (for example, __ppc64__
    isn't defined anywhere else in the kernel, which means we'd fall into
    the 32-bit definitions on ppc64).
    
    Tested on ppc64 with no regression on x86_64.

    dmaengine: dw: fix master selection
    
    [ Upstream commit 3fe6409c23e2bee4b2b1b6d671d2da8daa15271c ]
    
    The commit 895005202987 ("dmaengine: dw: apply both HS interfaces and remove
    slave_id usage") cleaned up the code to avoid usage of depricated slave_id
    member of generic slave configuration.
    
    Meanwhile it broke the master selection by removing important call to
    dwc_set_masters() in ->device_alloc_chan_resources() which copied masters from
    custom slave configuration to the internal channel structure.
    
    Everything works until now since there is no customized connection of
    DesignWare DMA IP to the bus, i.e. one bus and one or more masters are in use.
    The configurations where 2 masters are connected to the different masters are
    not working anymore. We are expecting one user of such configuration and need
    to select masters properly. Besides that it is obviously a performance
    regression since only one master is in use in multi-master configuration.
    
    Select masters in accordance with what user asked for. Keep this patch in a form
    more suitable for back porting.
    
    We are safe to take necessary data in ->device_alloc_chan_resources() because
    we don't support generic slave configuration embedded into custom one, and thus
    the only way to provide such is to use the parameter to a filter function which
    is called exactly before channel resource allocation.
    
    While here, replase BUG_ON to less noisy dev_warn() and prevent channel
    allocation in case of error.

    debugfs: Make automount point inodes permanently empty
    
    [ Upstream commit 87243deb88671f70def4c52dfa7ca7830707bd31 ]
    
    Starting with 4.1 the tracing subsystem has its own filesystem
    which is automounted in the tracing subdirectory of debugfs.
    Prior to this debugfs could be bind mounted in a cloned mount
    namespace, but if tracefs has been mounted under debugfs this
    now fails because there is a locked child mount. This creates
    a regression for container software which bind mounts debugfs
    to satisfy the assumption of some userspace software.
    
    In other pseudo filesystems such as proc and sysfs we're already
    creating mountpoints like this in such a way that no dirents can
    be created in the directories, allowing them to be exceptions to
    some MNT_LOCKED tests. In fact we're already do this for the
    tracefs mountpoint in sysfs.
    
    Do the same in debugfs_create_automount(), since the intention
    here is clearly to create a mountpoint. This fixes the regression,
    as locked child mounts on permanently empty directories do not
    cause a bind mount to fail.

    [Some background: the patch essentially skips the controls of a couple
     of FU volumes.  Although the firmware exposes the dB and the value
     information via the usb descriptor, changing the values (we set the
     min volume as default) screws up the device.  Although this has been
     fixed in the newer firmware, the devices are shipped with the old
     firmware, thus we need the workaround in the driver side.  -- tiwai]

    kvm: x86: do not leak guest xcr0 into host interrupt handlers
    
    [ Upstream commit fc5b7f3bf1e1414bd4e91db6918c85ace0c873a5 ]
    
    An interrupt handler that uses the fpu can kill a KVM VM, if it runs
    under the following conditions:
     - the guest's xcr0 register is loaded on the cpu
     - the guest's fpu context is not loaded
     - the host is using eagerfpu
    
    Note that the guest's xcr0 register and fpu context are not loaded as
    part of the atomic world switch into "guest mode". They are loaded by
    KVM while the cpu is still in "host mode".
    
    Usage of the fpu in interrupt context is gated by irq_fpu_usable(). The
    interrupt handler will look something like this:
    
    if (irq_fpu_usable()) {
            kernel_fpu_begin();
    
            [... code that uses the fpu ...]
    
            kernel_fpu_end();
    }
    
    As long as the guest's fpu is not loaded and the host is using eager
    fpu, irq_fpu_usable() returns true (interrupted_kernel_fpu_idle()
    returns true). The interrupt handler proceeds to use the fpu with
    the guest's xcr0 live.
    
    kernel_fpu_begin() saves the current fpu context. If this uses
    XSAVE[OPT], it may leave the xsave area in an undesirable state.
    According to the SDM, during XSAVE bit i of XSTATE_BV is not modified
    if bit i is 0 in xcr0. So it's possible that XSTATE_BV[i] == 1 and
    xcr0[i] == 0 following an XSAVE.
    
    kernel_fpu_end() restores the fpu context. Now if any bit i in
    XSTATE_BV == 1 while xcr0[i] == 0, XRSTOR generates a #GP. The
    fault is trapped and SIGSEGV is delivered to the current process.
    
    Only pre-4.2 kernels appear to be vulnerable to this sequence of
    events. Commit 653f52c ("kvm,x86: load guest FPU context more eagerly")
    from 4.2 forces the guest's fpu to always be loaded on eagerfpu hosts.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by keeping the host's xcr0 loaded outside
    of the interrupts-disabled region where KVM switches into guest mode.

    Handling exceptions from modules never worked on parisc.
    It was just masked by the fact that exceptions from modules
    don't happen during normal use.
    
    When a module triggers an exception in get_user() we need to load the
    main kernel dp value before accessing the exception_data structure, and
    afterwards restore the original dp value of the module on exit.

    Btrfs: fix file/data loss caused by fsync after rename and new inode

    If we rename an inode A (be it a file or a directory), create a new
    inode B with the old name of inode A and under the same parent directory,
    fsync inode B and then power fail, at log tree replay time we end up
    removing inode A completely. If inode A is a directory then all its files
    are gone too.

    This is reproducible with the following steps, taken from a couple of

       xfs_io -c fsync /mnt/a/x
       <power failure happens>
    
       The next time the fs is mounted, log tree replay happens and
       the directory "y" does not exist nor do the files "foo" and
       "bar" exist anywhere (neither in "y" nor in "x", nor the root
       nor anywhere).
    
       # Scenario 2
    
       mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc
       mount /dev/sdc /mnt
       mkdir /mnt/a
       echo "hello" > /mnt/a/foo
       sync
       mv /mnt/a/foo /mnt/a/bar
       echo "world" > /mnt/a/foo
       xfs_io -c fsync /mnt/a/foo
       <power failure happens>
    
       The next time the fs is mounted, log tree replay happens and the
       file "bar" does not exists anymore. A file with the name "foo"
       exists and it matches the second file we created.
    
    Another related problem that does not involve file/data loss is when a
    new inode is created with the name of a deleted snapshot and we fsync it:
    
       mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc
       mount /dev/sdc /mnt
       mkdir /mnt/testdir
       btrfs subvolume snapshot /mnt /mnt/testdir/snap
       btrfs subvolume delete /mnt/testdir/snap
       rmdir /mnt/testdir
       mkdir /mnt/testdir
       xfs_io -c fsync /mnt/testdir # or fsync some file inside /mnt/testdir
       <power failure>
    
       The next time the fs is mounted the log replay procedure fails because
       it attempts to delete the snapshot entry (which has dir item key type
       of BTRFS_ROOT_ITEM_KEY) as if it were a regular (non-root) entry,
       resulting in the following error that causes mount to fail:

    Fix this by forcing a transaction commit when such cases happen.
    This means we check in the commit root of the subvolume tree if there
    was any other inode with the same reference when the inode we are
    fsync'ing is a new inode (created in the current transaction).
    
    Test cases for fstests, covering all the scenarios given above, were
    submitted upstream for fstests:

    Btrfs: fix fsync after truncate when no_holes feature is enabled
    
    [ Upstream commit a89ca6f24ffe435edad57de02eaabd37a2c6bff6 ]
    
    When we have the no_holes feature enabled, if a we truncate a file to a
    smaller size, truncate it again but to a size greater than or equals to
    its original size and fsync it, the log tree will not have any information
    about the hole covering the range [truncate_1_offset, new_file_size[.
    Which means if the fsync log is replayed, the file will remain with the
    state it had before both truncate operations.
    
    Without the no_holes feature this does not happen, since when the inode
    is logged (full sync flag is set) it will find in the fs/subvol tree a
    leaf with a generation matching the current transaction id that has an
    explicit extent item representing the hole.
    
    Fix this by adding an explicit extent item representing a hole between
    the last extent and the inode's i_size if we are doing a full sync.
    
    The issue is easy to reproduce with the following test case for fstests:
    
      . ./common/rc
      . ./common/filter
      . ./common/dmflakey

      # This test was motivated by an issue found in btrfs when the btrfs
      # no-holes feature is enabled (introduced in kernel 3.14). So enable
      # the feature if the fs being tested is btrfs.
      if [ $FSTYP == "btrfs" ]; then
          _require_btrfs_fs_feature "no_holes"

    Btrfs: fix fsync xattr loss in the fast fsync path
    
    [ Upstream commit 36283bf777d963fac099213297e155d071096994 ]
    
    After commit 4f764e515361 ("Btrfs: remove deleted xattrs on fsync log
    replay"), we can end up in a situation where during log replay we end up
    deleting xattrs that were never deleted when their file was last fsynced.
    
    This happens in the fast fsync path (flag BTRFS_INODE_NEEDS_FULL_SYNC is
    not set in the inode) if the inode has the flag BTRFS_INODE_COPY_EVERYTHING
    set, the xattr was added in a past transaction and the leaf where the
    xattr is located was not updated (COWed or created) in the current
    transaction. In this scenario the xattr item never ends up in the log
    tree and therefore at log replay time, which makes the replay code delete
    the xattr from the fs/subvol tree as it thinks that xattr was deleted
    prior to the last fsync.
    
    Fix this by always logging all xattrs, which is the simplest and most
    reliable way to detect deleted xattrs and replay the deletes at log replay
    time.
    
    This issue is reproducible with the following test case for fstests:
    
      seq=`basename $0`
      seqres=$RESULT_DIR/$seq
      echo "QA output created by $seq"

    assoc_array: don't call compare_object() on a node
    
    [ Upstream commit 8d4a2ec1e0b41b0cf9a0c5cd4511da7f8e4f3de2 ]
    
    Changes since V1: fixed the description and added KASan warning.
    
    In assoc_array_insert_into_terminal_node(), we call the
    compare_object() method on all non-empty slots, even when they're
    not leaves, passing a pointer to an unexpected structure to
    compare_object(). Currently it causes an out-of-bound read access
    in keyring_compare_object detected by KASan (see below). The issue
    is easily reproduced with keyutils testsuite.
    Only call compare_object() when the slot is a leave.

    Plantronics BT300 does not support reading the sample rate which leads
    to many lines of "cannot get freq at ep 0x1". This patch adds the USB
    ID of the BT300 to quirks.c and avoids those error messages.

    rbd: use GFP_NOIO consistently for request allocations
    
    [ Upstream commit 2224d879c7c0f85c14183ef82eb48bd875ceb599 ]
    
    As of 5a60e87603c4c533492c515b7f62578189b03c9c, RBD object request
    allocations are made via rbd_obj_request_create() with GFP_NOIO.
    However, subsequent OSD request allocations in rbd_osd_req_create*()
    use GFP_ATOMIC.
    
    With heavy page cache usage (e.g. OSDs running on same host as krbd
    client), rbd_osd_req_create() order-1 GFP_ATOMIC allocations have been
    observed to fail, where direct reclaim would have allowed GFP_NOIO
    allocations to succeed.

    [ Upstream commit 95272c29378ee7dc15f43fa2758cb28a5913a06d ]
    
    -ftracer can duplicate asm blocks causing compilation to fail in
    noclone functions.  For example, KVM declares a global variable
    in an asm like
    
        asm("2: ... \n

             .global vmx_return \n
             vmx_return: .long 2b");
    
    and -ftracer causes a double declaration.

    drm/i915: Fix race condition in intel_dp_destroy_mst_connector()
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e60290dbafdf577766e5fc5f2fdb3be450cf9a6 ]
    
    After unplugging a DP MST display from the system, we have to go through
    and destroy all of the DRM connectors associated with it since none of
    them are valid anymore. Unfortunately, intel_dp_destroy_mst_connector()
    doesn't do a good enough job of ensuring that throughout the destruction
    process that no modesettings can be done with the connectors. As it is
    right now, intel_dp_destroy_mst_connector() works like this:
    
    * Take all modeset locks
    * Clear the configuration of the crtc on the connector, if there is one
    * Drop all modeset locks, this is required because of circular
      dependency issues that arise with trying to remove the connector from
      sysfs with modeset locks held
    * Unregister the connector
    * Take all modeset locks, again
    * Do the rest of the required cleaning for destroying the connector
    * Finally drop all modeset locks for good
    
    This only works sometimes. During the destruction process, it's very
    possible that a userspace application will attempt to do a modesetting
    using the connector. When we drop the modeset locks, an ioctl handler
    such as drm_mode_setcrtc has the oppurtunity to take all of the modeset
    locks from us. When this happens, one thing leads to another and
    eventually we end up committing a mode with the non-existent connector:
    
            [drm:intel_dp_link_training_clock_recovery [i915]] *ERROR* failed to enable link training
            [drm:intel_dp_aux_ch] dp_aux_ch timeout status 0x7cf0001f
            [drm:intel_dp_start_link_train [i915]] *ERROR* failed to start channel equalization
            [drm:intel_dp_aux_ch] dp_aux_ch timeout status 0x7cf0001f
            [drm:intel_mst_pre_enable_dp [i915]] *ERROR* failed to allocate vcpi
    
    And in some cases, such as with the T460s using an MST dock, this
    results in breaking modesetting and/or panicking the system.
    
    To work around this, we now unregister the connector at the very
    beginning of intel_dp_destroy_mst_connector(), grab all the modesetting
    locks, and then hold them until we finish the rest of the function.

    drm/i915: Update atomic state when removing mst connector, v3.
    
    [ Upstream commit 20fae983c6667d038e810c618e3340946b8dc506 ]
    
    Fully remove the MST connector from the atomic state, and remove the
    early returns in check_*_state for MST connectors.
    
    With atomic the state can be made consistent all the time.
    
    Thanks to Sivakumar Thulasimani for the idea of using
    drm_atomic_helper_set_config.
    
    Changes since v1:
    - Remove the MST check in intel_connector_check_state too.
    Changes since v2:
    - Use drm_atomic_helper_set_config.

    dmaengine: hsu: correct use of channel status register
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f4bc0abff79dc9d7ccbd3143adbf8ad1f4fe6ab ]
    
    There is a typo in documentation regarding to descriptor empty bit (DESCE)
    which is set to 1 when descriptor is empty. Thus, status register at the end of
    a transfer usually returns all DESCE bits set and thus it will never be zero.
    
    Moreover, there are 2 bits (CDESC) that encode current descriptor, on which
    interrupt has been asserted. In case when we have few descriptors programmed we
    might have non-zero value.
    
    Remove DESCE and CDESC bits from DMA channel status register (HSU_CH_SR) when
    reading it.

    usb: renesas_usbhs: fix to avoid using a disabled ep in usbhsg_queue_done()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4fccb0767fdbdb781a9c5b5c15ee7b219443c89d ]
    
    This patch fixes an issue that usbhsg_queue_done() may cause kernel
    panic when dma callback is running and usb_ep_disable() is called
    by interrupt handler. (Especially, we can reproduce this issue using
    g_audio with usb-dmac driver.)
    
    For example of a flow:
     usbhsf_dma_complete (on tasklet)
      --> usbhsf_pkt_handler (on tasklet)
       --> usbhsg_queue_done (on tasklet)
        *** interrupt happened and usb_ep_disable() is called ***
        --> usbhsg_queue_pop (on tasklet)
         Then, oops happened.

    xen/events: Mask a moving irq
    
    [ Upstream commit ff1e22e7a638a0782f54f81a6c9cb139aca2da35 ]
    
    Moving an unmasked irq may result in irq handler being invoked on both
    source and target CPUs.
    
    With 2-level this can happen as follows:
    
    On source CPU:
            evtchn_2l_handle_events() ->
                generic_handle_irq() ->
                    handle_edge_irq() ->
                       eoi_pirq():
                           irq_move_irq(data);
    
                           /***** WE ARE HERE *****/
    
                           if (VALID_EVTCHN(evtchn))
                               clear_evtchn(evtchn);
    
    If at this moment target processor is handling an unrelated event in
    evtchn_2l_handle_events()'s loop it may pick up our event since target's
    cpu_evtchn_mask claims that this event belongs to it *and* the event is
    unmasked and still pending. At the same time, source CPU will continue
    executing its own handle_edge_irq().
    
    With FIFO interrupt the scenario is similar: irq_move_irq() may result
    in a EVTCHNOP_unmask hypercall which, in turn, may make the event
    pending on the target CPU.
    
    We can avoid this situation by moving and clearing the event while
    keeping event masked.

    ext4: ignore quota mount options if the quota feature is enabled
    
    [ Upstream commit c325a67c72903e1cc30e990a15ce745bda0dbfde ]
    
    Previously, ext4 would fail the mount if the file system had the quota
    feature enabled and quota mount options (used for the older quota
    setups) were present.  This broke xfstests, since xfs silently ignores
    the usrquote and grpquota mount options if they are specified.  This
    commit changes things so that we are consistent with xfs; having the
    mount options specified is harmless, so no sense break users by
    forbidding them.

    KVM: x86: Inject pending interrupt even if pending nmi exist
    
    [ Upstream commit 321c5658c5e9192dea0d58ab67cf1791e45b2b26 ]
    
    Non maskable interrupts (NMI) are preferred to interrupts in current
    implementation. If a NMI is pending and NMI is blocked by the result
    of nmi_allowed(), pending interrupt is not injected and
    enable_irq_window() is not executed, even if interrupts injection is
    allowed.
    
    In old kernel (e.g. 2.6.32), schedule() is often called in NMI context.
    In this case, interrupts are needed to execute iret that intends end
    of NMI. The flag of blocking new NMI is not cleared until the guest
    execute the iret, and interrupts are blocked by pending NMI. Due to
    this, iret can't be invoked in the guest, and the guest is starved
    until block is cleared by some events (e.g. canceling injection).
    
    This patch injects pending interrupts, when it's allowed, even if NMI
    is blocked. And, If an interrupts is pending after executing
    inject_pending_event(), enable_irq_window() is executed regardless of
    NMI pending counter.

    ext4: add lockdep annotations for i_data_sem
    
    [ Upstream commit daf647d2dd58cec59570d7698a45b98e580f2076 ]
    
    With the internal Quota feature, mke2fs creates empty quota inodes and
    quota usage tracking is enabled as soon as the file system is mounted.
    Since quotacheck is no longer preallocating all of the blocks in the
    quota inode that are likely needed to be written to, we are now seeing
    a lockdep false positive caused by needing to allocate a quota block
    from inside ext4_map_blocks(), while holding i_data_sem for a data
    inode.  This results in this complaint:
    
      Possible unsafe locking scenario:
    
            CPU0                    CPU1
            ----                    ----
       lock(&ei->i_data_sem);
                                    lock(&s->s_dquot.dqio_mutex);
                                    lock(&ei->i_data_sem);

    sd: Fix excessive capacity printing on devices with blocks bigger than 512 bytes
    
    [ Upstream commit f08bb1e0dbdd0297258d0b8cd4dbfcc057e57b2a ]
    
    During revalidate we check whether device capacity has changed before we
    decide whether to output disk information or not.
    
    The check for old capacity failed to take into account that we scaled
    sdkp->capacity based on the reported logical block size. And therefore
    the capacity test would always fail for devices with sectors bigger than
    512 bytes and we would print several copies of the same discovery
    information.
    
    Avoid scaling sdkp->capacity and instead adjust the value on the fly
    when setting the block device capacity and generating fake C/H/S
    geometry.

    [media] au0828: Fix dev_state handling
    
    [ Upstream commit e8e3039f5b941f7825d335f8ca11c12a8104db11 ]
    
    The au0828 dev_state is actually a bit mask. It should not be
    checking with "==" but, instead, with a logic and. There are some
    places where it was doing it wrong.
    
    Fix that by replacing the dev_state set/clear/test with the
    bitops.
    
    As reviewed by Shuah:
            "Looks good. Tested running bind/unbind au0828 loop for 1000 times.
            Didn't see any problems and the v4l2_querycap() problem has been
            fixed with this patch.
    
            After the above test, ran bind/unbind snd_usb_audio 1000 times.
            Didn't see any problems. Generated media graph and the graph

    [media] au0828: fix au0828_v4l2_close() dev_state race condition
    
    [ Upstream commit ed940cd27416f9887864b95e1f8f8845aa9d6391 ]
    
    au0828_v4l2_close() check for dev_state == DEV_DISCONNECTED will fail to
    detect the device disconnected state correctly, if au0828_v4l2_open() runs
    to set the DEV_INITIALIZED bit. A loop test of bind/unbind found this bug
    by increasing the likelihood of au0828_v4l2_open() occurring while unbind
    is in progress. When au0828_v4l2_close() fails to detect that the device
    is in disconnect state, it attempts to power down the device and fails with
    the following general protection fault:

    drm/qxl: fix cursor position with non-zero hotspot
    
    [ Upstream commit d59a1f71ff1aeda4b4630df92d3ad4e3b1dfc885 ]
    
    The SPICE protocol considers the position of a cursor to be the location
    of its active pixel on the display, so the cursor is drawn with its
    top-left corner at "(x - hot_spot_x, y - hot_spot_y)" but the DRM cursor
    position gives the location where the top-left corner should be drawn,
    with the hotspot being a hint for drivers that need it.
    
    This fixes the location of the window resize cursors when using Fluxbox
    with the QXL DRM driver and both the QXL and modesetting X drivers.

    verification in the enable path. So, adding the check in a proper place
    as per the commit description.
    
    Not keeping this check during enable path as there is a chance of losing
    context and it is safe to do on idle as the context of the register will
    never be lost while the device is active.

    HID: usbhid: fix inconsistent reset/resume/reset-resume behavior
    
    [ Upstream commit 972e6a993f278b416a8ee3ec65475724fc36feb2 ]
    
    The usbhid driver has inconsistently duplicated code in its post-reset,
    resume, and reset-resume pathways.
    
            reset-resume doesn't check HID_STARTED before trying to
            restart the I/O queues.
    
            resume fails to clear the HID_SUSPENDED flag if HID_STARTED
            isn't set.
    
            resume calls usbhid_restart_queues() with usbhid->lock held
            and the others call it without holding the lock.
    
    The first item in particular causes a problem following a reset-resume
    if the driver hasn't started up its I/O.  URB submission fails because
    usbhid->urbin is NULL, and this triggers an unending reset-retry loop.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by creating a new subroutine,
    hid_restart_io(), to carry out all the common activities.  It also
    adds some checks that were missing in the original code:
    
            After a reset, there's no need to clear any halted endpoints.
    
            After a resume, if a reset is pending there's no need to
            restart any I/O until the reset is finished.
    
            After a resume, if the interrupt-IN endpoint is halted there's
            no need to submit the input URB until the halt has been
            cleared.
