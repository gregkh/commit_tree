    dm thin metadata: fix __udivdi3 undefined on 32-bit
    
    commit 013ad043906b2befd4a9bfb06219ed9fedd92716 upstream.
    
    sector_div() is only viable for use with sector_t.
    dm_block_t is typedef'd to uint64_t -- so use div_u64() instead.

    ocfs2: fix locking for res->tracking and dlm->tracking_list
    
    commit cbe355f57c8074bc4f452e5b6e35509044c6fa23 upstream.
    
    In dlm_init_lockres() we access and modify res->tracking and
    dlm->tracking_list without holding dlm->track_lock.  This can cause list
    corruptions and can end up in kernel panic.
    
    Fix this by locking res->tracking and dlm->tracking_list with
    dlm->track_lock instead of dlm->spinlock.

    proc: restrict kernel stack dumps to root
    
    commit f8a00cef17206ecd1b30d3d9f99e10d9fa707aa7 upstream.
    
    Currently, you can use /proc/self/task/*/stack to cause a stack walk on
    a task you control while it is running on another CPU.  That means that
    the stack can change under the stack walker.  The stack walker does
    have guards against going completely off the rails and into random
    kernel memory, but it can interpret random data from your kernel stack
    as instruction pointers and stack pointers.  This can cause exposure of
    kernel stack contents to userspace.
    
    Restrict the ability to inspect kernel stacks of arbitrary tasks to root
    in order to prevent a local attacker from exploiting racy stack unwinding
    to leak kernel task stack contents.  See the added comment for a longer
    rationale.
    
    There don't seem to be any users of this userspace API that can't
    gracefully bail out if reading from the file fails.  Therefore, I believe
    that this change is unlikely to break things.  In the case that this patch
    does end up needing a revert, the next-best solution might be to fake a
    single-entry stack based on wchan.

    crypto: mxs-dcp - Fix wait logic on chan threads
    
    commit d80771c08363ad7fbf0f56f5301e7ca65065c582 upstream.
    
    When compiling with CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP=y the mxs-dcp driver
    prints warnings such as:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 120 at kernel/sched/core.c:7736 __might_sleep+0x98/0x9c
    do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING; state=1 set at [<8081978c>] dcp_chan_thread_sha+0x3c/0x2ec
    
    The problem is that blocking ops will manipulate current->state
    themselves so it is not allowed to call them between
    set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE) and schedule().
    
    Fix this by converting the per-chan mutex to a spinlock (it only
    protects tiny list ops anyway) and rearranging the wait logic so that
    callbacks are called current->state as TASK_RUNNING. Those callbacks
    will indeed call blocking ops themselves so this is required.

    smb2: fix missing files in root share directory listing
    
    commit 0595751f267994c3c7027377058e4185b3a28e75 upstream.
    
    When mounting a Windows share that is the root of a drive (eg. C$)
    the server does not return . and .. directory entries. This results in
    the smb2 code path erroneously skipping the 2 first entries.
    
    Pseudo-code of the readdir() code path:
    
    cifs_readdir(struct file, struct dir_context)
        initiate_cifs_search            <-- if no reponse cached yet
            server->ops->query_dir_first
    
        dir_emit_dots
            dir_emit                    <-- adds "." and ".." if we're at pos=0
    
        find_cifs_entry
            initiate_cifs_search        <-- if pos < start of current response
                                             (restart search)
            server->ops->query_dir_next <-- if pos > end of current response
                                             (fetch next search res)
    
        for(...)                        <-- loops over cur response entries
                                              starting at pos
            cifs_filldir                <-- skip . and .., emit entry
                cifs_fill_dirent
                dir_emit
            pos++
    
    A) dir_emit_dots() always adds . & ..
       and sets the current dir pos to 2 (0 and 1 are done).
    
    Therefore we always want the index_to_find to be 2 regardless of if
    the response has . and ..
    
    B) smb1 code initializes index_of_last_entry with a +2 offset
    
      in cifssmb.c CIFSFindFirst():
                    psrch_inf->index_of_last_entry = 2 /* skip . and .. */ +
                            psrch_inf->entries_in_buffer;
    
    Later in find_cifs_entry() we want to find the next dir entry at pos=2
    as a result of (A)
    
            first_entry_in_buffer = cfile->srch_inf.index_of_last_entry -
                                            cfile->srch_inf.entries_in_buffer;
    
    This var is the dir pos that the first entry in the buffer will
    have therefore it must be 2 in the first call.
    
    If we don't offset index_of_last_entry by 2 (like in (B)),
    first_entry_in_buffer=0 but we were instructed to get pos=2 so this
    code in find_cifs_entry() skips the 2 first which is ok for non-root
    shares, as it skips . and .. from the response but is not ok for root
    shares where the 2 first are actual files
    
                    pos_in_buf = index_to_find - first_entry_in_buffer;
                    // pos_in_buf=2
                    // we skip 2 first response entries :(
                    for (i = 0; (i < (pos_in_buf)) && (cur_ent != NULL); i++) {
                            /* go entry by entry figuring out which is first */
                            cur_ent = nxt_dir_entry(cur_ent, end_of_smb,
                                                    cfile->srch_inf.info_level);
                    }
    
    C) cifs_filldir() skips . and .. so we can safely ignore them for now.
    
    Sample program:
    
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
            const char *path = argc >= 2 ? argv[1] : ".";
            DIR *dh;
            struct dirent *de;
    
            printf("listing path <%s>\n", path);
            dh = opendir(path);
            if (!dh) {
                    printf("opendir error %d\n", errno);
                    return 1;
            }
    
            while (1) {
                    de = readdir(dh);
                    if (!de) {
                            if (errno) {
                                    printf("readdir error %d\n", errno);
                                    return 1;
                            }
                            printf("end of listing\n");
                            break;
                    }
                    printf("off=%lu <%s>\n", de->d_off, de->d_name);
            }
    
            return 0;
    }
    
    Before the fix with SMB1 on root shares:
    
    <.>            off=1
    <..>           off=2
    <$Recycle.Bin> off=3
    <bootmgr>      off=4
    
    and on non-root shares:
    
    <.>    off=1
    <..>   off=4  <-- after adding .., the offsets jumps to +2 because
    <2536> off=5       we skipped . and .. from response buffer (C)
    <411>  off=6       but still incremented pos
    <file> off=7
    <fsx>  off=8
    
    Therefore the fix for smb2 is to mimic smb1 behaviour and offset the
    index_of_last_entry by 2.
    
    Test results comparing smb1 and smb2 before/after the fix on root
    share, non-root shares and on large directories (ie. multi-response
    dir listing):

    For inbound data with an unsupported HW header format, only dump the
    actual HW header. We have no idea how much payload follows it, and what
    it contains. Worst case, we dump past the end of the Inbound Buffer and
    access whatever is located next in memory.

    r8169: Clear RTL_FLAG_TASK_*_PENDING when clearing RTL_FLAG_TASK_ENABLED
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ad569019999300afd8e614d296fdc356550b77f ]
    
    After system suspend, sometimes the r8169 doesn't work when ethernet
    cable gets pluggued.
    
    This issue happens because rtl_reset_work() doesn't get called from
    rtl8169_runtime_resume(), after system suspend.
    
    In rtl_task(), RTL_FLAG_TASK_* only gets cleared if this condition is
    met:
    if (!netif_running(dev) ||
        !test_bit(RTL_FLAG_TASK_ENABLED, tp->wk.flags))
        ...
    
    If RTL_FLAG_TASK_ENABLED was cleared during system suspend while
    RTL_FLAG_TASK_RESET_PENDING was set, the next rtl_schedule_task() won't
    schedule task as the flag is still there.
    
    So in addition to clearing RTL_FLAG_TASK_ENABLED, also clears other
    flags.

    hexagon: modify ffs() and fls() to return int
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c41aaad409c097cf1ef74f2c649fed994744ef5 ]
    
    Building drivers/mtd/nand/raw/nandsim.c on arch/hexagon/ produces a
    printk format build warning.  This is due to hexagon's ffs() being
    coded as returning long instead of int.
    
    Fix the printk format warning by changing all of hexagon's ffs() and
    fls() functions to return int instead of long.  The variables that
    they return are already int instead of long.  This return type
    matches the return type in <asm-generic/bitops/>.

    dm thin metadata: try to avoid ever aborting transactions
    
    [ Upstream commit 3ab91828166895600efd9cdc3a0eb32001f7204a ]
    
    Committing a transaction can consume some metadata of it's own, we now
    reserve a small amount of metadata to cover this.  Free metadata
    reported by the kernel will not include this reserve.
    
    If any of the reserve has been used after a commit we enter a new
    internal state PM_OUT_OF_METADATA_SPACE.  This is reported as
    PM_READ_ONLY, so no userland changes are needed.  If the metadata
    device is resized the pool will move back to PM_WRITE.
    
    These changes mean we never need to abort and rollback a transaction due
    to running out of metadata space.  This is particularly important
    because there have been a handful of reports of data corruption against
    DM thin-provisioning that can all be attributed to the thin-pool having
    ran out of metadata space.

    [ Upstream commit 14427b86837a4baf1c121934c6599bdb67dfa9fc ]
    
    snprintf() always returns the full length of the string it could have
    printed, even if it was truncated because the buffer was too small.
    So in case the counter value is truncated, we will over-read from
    in_buffer and over-write to the caller's buffer.
    
    I don't think it's actually possible for this to happen, but in case
    truncation occurs, WARN and return -EIO.

    RDMA/ucma: check fd type in ucma_migrate_id()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d23ba6034b9cf48b8918404367506da3e4b3ee5 ]
    
    The current code grabs the private_data of whatever file descriptor
    userspace has supplied and implicitly casts it to a `struct ucma_file *`,
    potentially causing a type confusion.
    
    This is probably fine in practice because the pointer is only used for
    comparisons, it is never actually dereferenced; and even in the
    comparisons, it is unlikely that a file from another filesystem would have
    a ->private_data pointer that happens to also be valid in this context.
    But ->private_data is not always guaranteed to be a valid pointer to an
    object owned by the file's filesystem; for example, some filesystems just
    cram numbers in there.
    
    Check the type of the supplied file descriptor to be safe, analogous to how
    other places in the kernel do it.

    Code:
    
      #include <sys/mman.h>

      #define SIZE 2*1024*1024

        void *ptr;
        ptr = mmap(NULL, SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_HUGETLB | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
        madvise(ptr, SIZE, MADV_DONTDUMP);
        madvise(ptr, SIZE, MADV_DODUMP);
      }
    
    Compile and strace:
    
      mmap(NULL, 2097152, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_HUGETLB, -1, 0) = 0x7ff7c9200000

      madvise(0x7ff7c9200000, 2097152, MADV_DODUMP) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
    
    hugetlbfs pages have VM_DONTEXPAND in the VmFlags driver pages based on
    author testing with analysis from Florian Weimer[1].
    
    The inclusion of VM_DONTEXPAND into the VM_SPECIAL defination was a
    consequence of the large useage of VM_DONTEXPAND in device drivers.
    
    A consequence of [2] is that VM_DONTEXPAND marked pages are unable to be
    marked DODUMP.
    
    A user could quite legitimately madvise(MADV_DONTDUMP) their hugetlbfs
    memory for a while and later request that madvise(MADV_DODUMP) on the same
    memory.  We correct this omission by allowing madvice(MADV_DODUMP) on
    hugetlbfs pages.

    mac80211: Fix station bandwidth setting after channel switch
    
    [ Upstream commit 0007e94355fdb71a1cf5dba0754155cba08f0666 ]
    
    When performing a channel switch flow for a managed interface, the
    flow did not update the bandwidth of the AP station and the rate
    scale algorithm. In case of a channel width downgrade, this would
    result with the rate scale algorithm using a bandwidth that does not
    match the interface channel configuration.
    
    Fix this by updating the AP station bandwidth and rate scaling algorithm
    before the actual channel change in case of a bandwidth downgrade, or
    after the actual channel change in case of a bandwidth upgrade.

    mac80211: fix a race between restart and CSA flows
    
    [ Upstream commit f3ffb6c3a28963657eb8b02a795d75f2ebbd5ef4 ]
    
    We hit a problem with iwlwifi that was caused by a bug in
    mac80211. A bug in iwlwifi caused the firwmare to crash in
    certain cases in channel switch. Because of that bug,
    drv_pre_channel_switch would fail and trigger the restart
    flow.
    Now we had the hw restart worker which runs on the system's
    workqueue and the csa_connection_drop_work worker that runs
    on mac80211's workqueue that can run together. This is
    obviously problematic since the restart work wants to
    reconfigure the connection, while the csa_connection_drop_work
    worker does the exact opposite: it tries to disconnect.
    
    Fix this by cancelling the csa_connection_drop_work worker
    in the restart worker.
    
    Note that this can sound racy: we could have:
    
    driver   iface_work   CSA_work   restart_work
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                  |
     <--drv_cs ---|
    <FW CRASH!>
    -CS FAILED-->
                  |                       |
                  |                 cancel_work(CSA)
               schedule                   |
               CSA work                   |
                             |            |
                            Race between those 2
    
    But this is not possible because we flush the workqueue
    in the restart worker before we cancel the CSA worker.
    That would be bullet proof if we could guarantee that
    we schedule the CSA worker only from the iface_work
    which runs on the workqueue (and not on the system's
    workqueue), but unfortunately we do have an instance
    in which we schedule the CSA work outside the context
    of the workqueue (ieee80211_chswitch_done).
    
    Note also that we should probably cancel other workers
    like beacon_connection_loss_work and possibly others
    for different types of interfaces, at the very least,
    IBSS should suffer from the exact same problem, but for
    now, do the minimum to fix the actual bug that was actually
    experienced and reproduced.

    cfg80211: fix a type issue in ieee80211_chandef_to_operating_class()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8442938c3a2177ba16043b3a935f2c78266ad399 ]
    
    The "chandef->center_freq1" variable is a u32 but "freq" is a u16 so we
    are truncating away the high bits.  I noticed this bug because in commit
    9cf0a0b4b64a ("cfg80211: Add support for 60GHz band channels 5 and 6")
    we made "freq <= 56160 + 2160 * 6" a valid requency when before it was
    only "freq <= 56160 + 2160 * 4" that was valid.  It introduces a static
    checker warning:
    
        net/wireless/util.c:1571 ieee80211_chandef_to_operating_class()
        warn: always true condition '(freq <= 56160 + 2160 * 6) => (0-u16max <= 69120)'
    
    But really we probably shouldn't have been truncating the high bits
    away to begin with.

    fs/cifs: don't translate SFM_SLASH (U+F026) to backslash
    
    [ Upstream commit c15e3f19a6d5c89b1209dc94b40e568177cb0921 ]
    
    When a Mac client saves an item containing a backslash to a file server
    the backslash is represented in the CIFS/SMB protocol as as U+F026.
    Before this change, listing a directory containing an item with a
    backslash in its name will return that item with the backslash
    represented with a true backslash character (U+005C) because
    convert_sfm_character mapped U+F026 to U+005C when interpretting the
    CIFS/SMB protocol response.  However, attempting to open or stat the
    path using a true backslash will result in an error because
    convert_to_sfm_char does not map U+005C back to U+F026 causing the
    CIFS/SMB request to be made with the backslash represented as U+005C.
    
    This change simply prevents the U+F026 to U+005C conversion from
    happenning.  This is analogous to how the code does not do any
    translation of UNI_SLASH (U+F000).

    The kernel module may sleep with holding a spinlock.
    
    The function call paths (from bottom to top) in Linux-4.16 are:

    RAID10 BUG_ON in raise_barrier when force is true and conf->barrier is 0
    
    [ Upstream commit 1d0ffd264204eba1861865560f1f7f7a92919384 ]
    
    In raid10 reshape_request it gets max_sectors in read_balance. If the underlayer disks
    have bad blocks, the max_sectors is less than last. It will call goto read_more many
    times. It calls raise_barrier(conf, sectors_done != 0) every time. In this condition
    sectors_done is not 0. So the value passed to the argument force of raise_barrier is
    true.
    
    In raise_barrier it checks conf->barrier when force is true. If force is true and
    conf->barrier is 0, it panic. In this case reshape_request submits bio to under layer
    disks. And in the callback function of the bio it calls lower_barrier. If the bio
    finishes before calling raise_barrier again, it can trigger the BUG_ON.
    
    Add one pair of raise_barrier/lower_barrier to fix this bug.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't truncate HPTE index in xlate function
    
    [ Upstream commit 46dec40fb741f00f1864580130779aeeaf24fb3d ]
    
    This fixes a bug which causes guest virtual addresses to get translated
    to guest real addresses incorrectly when the guest is using the HPT MMU
    and has more than 256GB of RAM, or more specifically has a HPT larger
    than 2GB.  This has showed up in testing as a failure of the host to
    emulate doorbell instructions correctly on POWER9 for HPT guests with
    more than 256GB of RAM.
    
    The bug is that the HPTE index in kvmppc_mmu_book3s_64_hv_xlate()
    is stored as an int, and in forming the HPTE address, the index gets
    shifted left 4 bits as an int before being signed-extended to 64 bits.
    The simple fix is to make the variable a long int, matching the
    return type of kvmppc_hv_find_lock_hpte(), which is what calculates
    the index.

    media: v4l: event: Prevent freeing event subscriptions while accessed
    
    commit ad608fbcf166fec809e402d548761768f602702c upstream.
    
    The event subscriptions are added to the subscribed event list while
    holding a spinlock, but that lock is subsequently released while still
    accessing the subscription object. This makes it possible to unsubscribe
    the event --- and freeing the subscription object's memory --- while
    the subscription object is simultaneously accessed.
    
    Prevent this by adding a mutex to serialise the event subscription and
    unsubscription. This also gives a guarantee to the callback ops that the
    add op has returned before the del op is called.
    
    This change also results in making the elems field less special:
    subscriptions are only added to the event list once they are fully
    initialised.

    i2c: i801: Allow ACPI AML access I/O ports not reserved for SMBus
    
    [ Upstream commit 7fd6d98b89f382d414e1db528e29a67bbd749457 ]
    
    Commit 7ae81952cda ("i2c: i801: Allow ACPI SystemIO OpRegion to conflict
    with PCI BAR") made it possible for AML code to access SMBus I/O ports
    by installing custom SystemIO OpRegion handler and blocking i80i driver
    access upon first AML read/write to this OpRegion.
    
    However, while ThinkPad T560 does have SystemIO OpRegion declared under
    the SMBus device, it does not access any of the SMBus registers:
    
        Device (SMBU)
        {
            ...
    
            OperationRegion (SMBP, PCI_Config, 0x50, 0x04)
            Field (SMBP, DWordAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
            {
                ,   5,
                TCOB,   11,
                Offset (0x04)
            }
    
            Name (TCBV, 0x00)
            Method (TCBS, 0, NotSerialized)
            {
                If ((TCBV == 0x00))
                {
                TCBV = (\_SB.PCI0.SMBU.TCOB << 0x05)
                }
    
                Return (TCBV) /* \_SB_.PCI0.SMBU.TCBV */
            }
    
            OperationRegion (TCBA, SystemIO, TCBS (), 0x10)
            Field (TCBA, ByteAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
            {
                Offset (0x04),
                ,   9,
                CPSC,   1
            }
        }
    
    Problem with the current approach is that it blocks all I/O port access
    and because this system has touchpad connected to the SMBus controller
    after first AML access (happens during suspend/resume cycle) the
    touchpad fails to work anymore.
    
    Fix this so that we allow ACPI AML I/O port access if it does not touch
    the region reserved for the SMBus.

    When expanding the extra isize space, we must never move the

    We currently allow userspace to access the core register file
    in about any possible way, including straddling multiple
    registers and doing unaligned accesses.
    
    This is not the expected use of the ABI, and nobody is actually
    using it that way. Let's tighten it by explicitly checking

    USB: remove LPM management from usb_driver_claim_interface()
    
    commit c183813fcee44a249339b7c46e1ad271ca1870aa upstream.
    
    usb_driver_claim_interface() disables and re-enables Link Power
    Management, but it shouldn't do either one, for the reasons listed
    below.  This patch removes the two LPM-related function calls from the
    routine.
    
    The reason for disabling LPM in the analogous function
    usb_probe_interface() is so that drivers won't have to deal with
    unwanted LPM transitions in their probe routine.  But
    usb_driver_claim_interface() doesn't call the driver's probe routine
    (or any other callbacks), so that reason doesn't apply here.
    
    Furthermore, no driver other than usbfs will ever call
    usb_driver_claim_interface() unless it is already bound to another
    interface in the same device, which means disabling LPM here would be
    redundant.  usbfs doesn't interact with LPM at all.
    
    Lastly, the error return from usb_unlocked_disable_lpm() isn't handled
    properly; the code doesn't clean up its earlier actions before
    returning.

    USB: usbdevfs: restore warning for nonsensical flags
    
    commit 81e0403b26d94360abd1f6a57311337973bc82cd upstream.
    
    If we filter flags before they reach the core we need to generate our
    own warnings.

    USB: usbdevfs: sanitize flags more
    
    commit 7a68d9fb851012829c29e770621905529bd9490b upstream.
    
    Requesting a ZERO_PACKET or not is sensible only for output.
    In the input direction the device decides.
    Likewise accepting short packets makes sense only for input.
    
    This allows operation with panic_on_warn without opening up
    a local DOS.

    media: uvcvideo: Support UVC 1.5 video probe & commit controls
    
    The length of UVC 1.5 video control is 48, and it is 34 for UVC 1.1.
    Change it to 48 for UVC 1.5 device, and the UVC 1.5 device can be
    recognized.
    
    More changes to the driver are needed for full UVC 1.5 compatibility.
    However, at least the UVC 1.5 Realtek RTS5847/RTS5852 cameras have been
    reported to work well.

    USB: handle NULL config in usb_find_alt_setting()
    
    commit c9a4cb204e9eb7fa7dfbe3f7d3a674fa530aa193 upstream.
    
    usb_find_alt_setting() takes a pointer to a struct usb_host_config as
    an argument; it searches for an interface with specified interface and
    alternate setting numbers in that config.  However, it crashes if the
    usb_host_config pointer argument is NULL.
    
    Since this is a general-purpose routine, available for use in many
    places, we want to to be more robust.  This patch makes it return NULL
    whenever the config argument is NULL.

    USB: fix error handling in usb_driver_claim_interface()
    
    commit bd729f9d67aa9a303d8925bb8c4f06af25f407d1 upstream.
    
    The syzbot fuzzing project found a use-after-free bug in the USB
    core.  The bug was caused by usbfs not unbinding from an interface
    when the USB device file was closed, which led another process to
    attempt the unbind later on, after the private data structure had been
    deallocated.
    
    The reason usbfs did not unbind the interface at the appropriate time
    was because it thought the interface had never been claimed in the
    first place.  This was caused by the fact that
    usb_driver_claim_interface() does not clean up properly when
    device_bind_driver() returns an error.  Although the error code gets
    passed back to the caller, the iface->dev.driver pointer remains set
    and iface->condition remains equal to USB_INTERFACE_BOUND.
    
    This patch adds proper error handling to usb_driver_claim_interface().

    spi: rspi: Fix interrupted DMA transfers
    
    commit 8dbbaa47b96f6ea5f09f922b4effff3c505cd8cf upstream.
    
    When interrupted, wait_event_interruptible_timeout() returns
    -ERESTARTSYS, and the SPI transfer in progress will fail, as expected:
    
        m25p80 spi0.0: SPI transfer failed: -512
        spi_master spi0: failed to transfer one message from queue
    
    However, as the underlying DMA transfers may not have completed, all
    subsequent SPI transfers may start to fail:
    
        spi_master spi0: receive timeout
        qspi_transfer_out_in() returned -110
        m25p80 spi0.0: SPI transfer failed: -110
        spi_master spi0: failed to transfer one message from queue
    
    Fix this by calling dmaengine_terminate_all() not only for timeouts, but
    also for errors.
    
    This can be reproduced on r8a7991/koelsch, using "hd /dev/mtd0" followed

    floppy: Do not copy a kernel pointer to user memory in FDGETPRM ioctl
    
    commit 65eea8edc315589d6c993cf12dbb5d0e9ef1fe4e upstream.
    
    The final field of a floppy_struct is the field "name", which is a pointer
    to a string in kernel memory.  The kernel pointer should not be copied to
    user memory.  The FDGETPRM ioctl copies a floppy_struct to user memory,
    including this "name" field.  This pointer cannot be used by the user
    and it will leak a kernel address to user-space, which will reveal the
    location of kernel code and data and undermine KASLR protection.
    
    Model this code after the compat ioctl which copies the returned data
    to a previously cleared temporary structure on the stack (excluding the
    name pointer) and copy out to userspace from there.  As we already have
    an inparam union with an appropriate member and that memory is already
    cleared even for read only calls make use of that as a temporary store.
    
    Based on an initial patch by Brian Belleville.

    module: exclude SHN_UNDEF symbols from kallsyms api
    
    [ Upstream commit 9f2d1e68cf4d641def734adaccfc3823d3575e6c ]
    
    Livepatch modules are special in that we preserve their entire symbol
    tables in order to be able to apply relocations after module load. The
    unwanted side effect of this is that undefined (SHN_UNDEF) symbols of
    livepatch modules are accessible via the kallsyms api and this can
    confuse symbol resolution in livepatch (klp_find_object_symbol()) and
    cause subtle bugs in livepatch.
    
    Have the module kallsyms api skip over SHN_UNDEF symbols. These symbols
    are usually not available for normal modules anyway as we cut down their
    symbol tables to just the core (non-undefined) symbols, so this should
    really just affect livepatch modules. Note that this patch doesn't
    affect the display of undefined symbols in /proc/kallsyms.

    ARM: mvebu: declare asm symbols as character arrays in pmsu.c
    
    [ Upstream commit d0d378ff451a66e486488eec842e507d28145813 ]
    
    With CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE, memcpy uses the declared size of operands to
    detect buffer overflows.  If src or dest is declared as a char, attempts to
    copy more than byte will result in a fortify_panic().
    
    Address this problem in mvebu_setup_boot_addr_wa() by declaring
    mvebu_boot_wa_start and mvebu_boot_wa_end as character arrays.  Also remove
    a couple addressof operators to avoid "arithmetic on pointer to an
    incomplete type" compiler error.
    
    See commit 54a7d50b9205 ("x86: mark kprobe templates as character arrays,
    not single characters") for a similar fix.
    
    Fixes "detected buffer overflow in memcpy" error during init on some mvebu
    systems (armada-370-xp, armada-375):
    
    (fortify_panic) from (mvebu_setup_boot_addr_wa+0xb0/0xb4)
    (mvebu_setup_boot_addr_wa) from (mvebu_v7_cpu_pm_init+0x154/0x204)

    rndis_wlan: potential buffer overflow in rndis_wlan_auth_indication()
    
    [ Upstream commit ae636fb1554833ee5133ca47bf4b2791b6739c52 ]
    
    This is a static checker fix, not something I have tested.  The issue
    is that on the second iteration through the loop, we jump forward by
    le32_to_cpu(auth_req->length) bytes.  The problem is that if the length
    is more than "buflen" then we end up with a negative "buflen".  A
    negative buflen is type promoted to a high positive value and the loop
    continues but it's accessing beyond the end of the buffer.
    
    I believe the "auth_req->length" comes from the firmware and if the
    firmware is malicious or buggy, you're already toasted so the impact of
    this bug is probably not very severe.

    [ Upstream commit 8632c614565d0c5fdde527889601c018e97b6384 ]
    
    The ashmem driver did not check that the size/offset of the vma passed
    to its .mmap() function was not larger than the ashmem object being
    mapped. This could cause mmap() to succeed, even though accessing parts
    of the mapping would later fail with a segmentation fault.
    
    Ensure an error is returned by the ashmem_mmap() function if the vma
    size is larger than the ashmem object size. This enables safer handling
    of the problem in userspace.

    media: omap3isp: zero-initialize the isp cam_xclk{a,b} initial data
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ec7debd44b49927a6e2861521994cc075a389ed ]
    
    The struct clk_init_data init variable is declared in the isp_xclk_init()
    function so is an automatic variable allocated in the stack. But it's not
    explicitly zero-initialized, so some init fields are left uninitialized.
    
    This causes the data structure to have undefined values that may confuse
    the common clock framework when the clock is registered.
    
    For example, the uninitialized .flags field could have the CLK_IS_CRITICAL
    bit set, causing the framework to wrongly prepare the clk on registration.
    This leads to the isp_xclk_prepare() callback being called, which in turn
    calls to the omap3isp_get() function that increments the isp dev refcount.
    
    Since this omap3isp_get() call is unexpected, this leads to an unbalanced
    omap3isp_get() call that prevents the requested IRQ to be later enabled,
    due the refcount not being 0 when the correct omap3isp_get() call happens.

    [ Upstream commit 22216ec41e919682c15345e95928f266e8ba6f9e ]
    
    The banding filter ON/OFF is controlled via bit 5 of COM8 register.  It
    is attempted to be enabled in ov772x_set_params() by the following line.
    
            ret = ov772x_mask_set(client, COM8, BNDF_ON_OFF, 1);
    
    But this unexpectedly results disabling the banding filter, because the
    mask and set bits are exclusive.
    
    On the other hand, ov772x_s_ctrl() correctly sets the bit by:
    
            ret = ov772x_mask_set(client, COM8, BNDF_ON_OFF, BNDF_ON_OFF);
    
    The same fix was already applied to non-soc_camera version of ov772x
    driver in the commit commit a024ee14cd36 ("media: ov772x: correct setting
    of banding filter")

    What gcc complains about here is the misuse of strncat function, which
    in this case does not limit a number of bytes taken from "src", so it is
    in the end the same as strcat(seg->res_name, " (DCSS)");
    
    Keeping in mind that a res_name is 15 bytes, strncat in this case
    would overflow the buffer and write 0 into alignment byte between the
    fields in the struct. To avoid that increasing res_name size to 16,
    and reusing strlcat.

    powerpc/powernv/ioda2: Reduce upper limit for DMA window size
    
    [ Upstream commit d3d4ffaae439981e1e441ebb125aa3588627c5d8 ]
    
    We use PHB in mode1 which uses bit 59 to select a correct DMA window.
    However there is mode2 which uses bits 59:55 and allows up to 32 DMA
    windows per a PE.
    
    Even though documentation does not clearly specify that, it seems that
    the actual hardware does not support bits 59:55 even in mode1, in other
    words we can create a window as big as 1<<58 but DMA simply won't work.
    
    This reduces the upper limit from 59 to 55 bits to let the userspace know
    about the hardware limits.

    scsi: ibmvscsi: Improve strings handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 1262dc09dc9ae7bf4ad00b6a2c5ed6a6936bcd10 ]
    
    Currently an open firmware property is copied into partition_name variable
    without keeping a room for \0.
    
    Later one, this variable (partition_name), which is 97 bytes long, is
    strncpyed into ibmvcsci_host_data->madapter_info->partition_name, which is
    96 bytes long, possibly truncating it 'again' and removing the \0.
    
    This patch simply decreases the partition name to 96 and just copy using
    strlcpy() which guarantees that the string is \0 terminated. I think there
    is no issue if this there is a truncation in this very first copy, i.e,
    when the open firmware property is read and copied into the driver for the
    very first time;
    
    This issue also causes the following warning on GCC 8:
    
            drivers/scsi/ibmvscsi/ibmvscsi.c:281:2: warning:  strncpy  output may be truncated copying 96 bytes from a string of length 96 [-Wstringop-truncation]

    scsi: klist: Make it safe to use klists in atomic context
    
    [ Upstream commit 624fa7790f80575a4ec28fbdb2034097dc18d051 ]
    
    In the scsi_transport_srp implementation it cannot be avoided to
    iterate over a klist from atomic context when using the legacy block
    layer instead of blk-mq. Hence this patch that makes it safe to use
    klists in atomic context. This patch avoids that lockdep reports the
    following:

    x86/entry/64: Add two more instruction suffixes
    
    [ Upstream commit 6709812f094d96543b443645c68daaa32d3d3e77 ]
    
    Sadly, other than claimed in:
    
      a368d7fd2a ("x86/entry/64: Add instruction suffix")
    
    ... there are two more instances which want to be adjusted.
    
    As said there, omitting suffixes from instructions in AT&T mode is bad
    practice when operand size cannot be determined by the assembler from
    register operands, and is likely going to be warned about by upstream
    gas in the future (mine does already).
    
    Add the other missing suffixes here as well.

    md-cluster: clear another node's suspend_area after the copy is finished
    
    [ Upstream commit 010228e4a932ca1e8365e3b58c8e1e44c16ff793 ]
    
    When one node leaves cluster or stops the resyncing
    (resync or recovery) array, then other nodes need to
    call recover_bitmaps to continue the unfinished task.
    
    But we need to clear suspend_area later after other
    nodes copy the resync information to their bitmap
    (by call bitmap_copy_from_slot). Otherwise, all nodes
    could write to the suspend_area even the suspend_area
    is not handled by any node, because area_resyncing
    returns 0 at the beginning of raid1_write_request.
    Which means one node could write suspend_area while
    another node is resyncing the same area, then data
    could be inconsistent.
    
    So let's clear suspend_area later to avoid above issue
    with the protection of bm lock. Also it is straightforward
    to clear suspend_area after nodes have copied the resync
    info to bitmap.

    6lowpan: iphc: reset mac_header after decompress to fix panic
    
    [ Upstream commit 03bc05e1a4972f73b4eb8907aa373369e825c252 ]
    
    After decompression of 6lowpan socket data, an IPv6 header is inserted
    before the existing socket payload.  After this, we reset the
    network_header value of the skb to account for the difference in payload
    size from prior to decompression + the addition of the IPv6 header.
    
    However, we fail to reset the mac_header value.
    
    Leaving the mac_header value untouched here, can cause a calculation
    error in net/packet/af_packet.c packet_rcv() function when an
    AF_PACKET socket is opened in SOCK_RAW mode for use on a 6lowpan
    interface.
    
    On line 2088, the data pointer is moved backward by the value returned
    from skb_mac_header().  If skb->data is adjusted so that it is before
    the skb->head pointer (which can happen when an old value of mac_header
    is left in place) the kernel generates a panic in net/core/skbuff.c
    line 1717.
    
    This panic can be generated by BLE 6lowpan interfaces (such as bt0) and
    802.15.4 interfaces (such as lowpan0) as they both use the same 6lowpan
    sources for compression and decompression.

    power: vexpress: fix corruption in notifier registration
    
    [ Upstream commit 09bebb1adb21ecd04adf7ccb3b06f73e3a851e93 ]
    
    Vexpress platforms provide two different restart handlers: SYS_REBOOT
    that restart the entire system, while DB_RESET only restarts the
    daughter board containing the CPU. DB_RESET is overridden by SYS_REBOOT
    if it exists.
    
    notifier_chain_register used in register_restart_handler by design
    relies on notifiers to be registered once only, however vexpress restart
    notifier can get registered twice. When this happen it corrupts list
    of notifiers, as result some notifiers can be not called on proper
    event, traverse on list can be cycled forever, and second unregister
    can access already freed memory.
    
    So far, since this was the only restart handler in the system, no issue
    was observed even if the same notifier was registered twice. However
    commit 6c5c0d48b686 ("watchdog: sp805: add restart handler") added
    support for SP805 restart handlers and since the system under test
    contains two vexpress restart and two SP805 watchdog instances, it was
    observed that during the boot traversing the restart handler list looped
    forever as there's a cycle in that list resulting in boot hang.
    
    This patch fixes the issues by ensuring that the notifier is installed

    staging: rts5208: fix missing error check on call to rtsx_write_register
    
    [ Upstream commit c5fae4f4fd28189b1062fb8ef7b21fec37cb8b17 ]
    
    Currently the check on error return from the call to rtsx_write_register
    is checking the error status from the previous call. Fix this by adding
    in the missing assignment of retval.

    [ Upstream commit 7fb2fd4e25fc1fb10dcb30b5519de257cfeae84c ]
    
    The problem is that if get_user_pages_fast() fails and returns a
    negative error code, it gets type promoted to a high positive value and
    treated as a success.

    tsl2550: fix lux1_input error in low light
    
    [ Upstream commit ce054546cc2c26891cefa2f284d90d93b52205de ]
    
    ADC channel 0 photodiode detects both infrared + visible light,
    but ADC channel 1 just detects infrared. However, the latter is a bit
    more sensitive in that range so complete darkness or low light causes
    a error condition in which the chan0 - chan1 is negative that
    results in a -EAGAIN.
    
    This patch changes the resulting lux1_input sysfs attribute message from
    "Resource temporarily unavailable" to a user-grokable lux value of 0.

    crypto: skcipher - Fix -Wstringop-truncation warnings
    
    [ Upstream commit cefd769fd0192c84d638f66da202459ed8ad63ba ]
    
    As of GCC 9.0.0 the build is reporting warnings like:
    
        crypto/ablkcipher.c: In function ‘crypto_ablkcipher_report’:
        crypto/ablkcipher.c:374:2: warning: ‘strncpy’ specified bound 64 equals destination size [-Wstringop-truncation]
          strncpy(rblkcipher.geniv, alg->cra_ablkcipher.geniv ?: "<default>",
          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
           sizeof(rblkcipher.geniv));
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    This means the strnycpy might create a non null terminated string.  Fix this by
    explicitly performing '\0' termination.
