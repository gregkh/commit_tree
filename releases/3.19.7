    drivers: platform: parse IRQ flags from resources
    
    commit 7085a7401ba54e92bbb5aa24d6f428071e18e509 upstream.
    
    This fixes a regression from the net subsystem:
    After commit d52fdbb735c36a209f36a628d40ca9185b349ba7
    "smc91x: retrieve IRQ and trigger flags in a modern way"
    a regression would appear on some legacy platforms such
    as the ARM PXA Zylonite that specify IRQ resources like
    this:
    
    static struct resource r = {
           .start  = X,
           .end    = X,
           .flags  = IORESOURCE_IRQ | IORESOURCE_IRQ_HIGHEDGE,
    };
    
    The previous code would retrieve the resource and parse
    the high edge setting in the SMC91x driver, a use pattern
    that means every driver specifying an IRQ flag from a
    static resource need to parse resource flags and apply
    them at runtime.
    
    As we switched the code to use IRQ descriptors to retrieve
    the the trigger type like this:
    
      irqd_get_trigger_type(irq_get_irq_data(...));
    
    the code would work for new platforms using e.g. device
    tree as the backing irq descriptor would have its flags
    properly set, whereas this kind of oldstyle static
    resources at no point assign the trigger flags to the
    corresponding IRQ descriptor.
    
    To make the behaviour identical on modern device tree
    and legacy static platform data platforms, modify
    platform_get_irq() to assign the trigger flags to the
    irq descriptor when a client looks up an IRQ from static
    resources.

    Using the indenting we can see the curly braces were obviously intended.
    This is a static checker fix, but my guess is that we don't read enough

    C6x: time: Ensure consistency in __init
    
    commit f4831605f2dacd12730fe73961c77253cc2ea425 upstream.
    
    time_init invokes timer64_init (which is __init annotation)
    since all of these are invoked at init time, lets maintain
    consistency by ensuring time_init is marked appropriately
    as well.
    
    This fixes the following warning with CONFIG_DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH=y
    
    WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x3bfc): Section mismatch in reference from the function time_init() to the function .init.text:timer64_init()
    The function time_init() references
    the function __init timer64_init().
    This is often because time_init lacks a __init
    annotation or the annotation of timer64_init is wrong.

    crypto: omap-aes - Fix support for unequal lengths
    
    commit 6d7e7e02a044025237b6f62a20521170b794537f upstream.
    
    For cases where total length of an input SGs is not same as
    length of the input data for encryption, omap-aes driver
    crashes. This happens in the case when IPsec is trying to use
    omap-aes driver.
    
    To avoid this, we copy all the pages from the input SG list
    into a contiguous buffer and prepare a single element SG list
    for this buffer with length as the total bytes to crypt, which is
    similar thing that is done in case of unaligned lengths.

    wl18xx: show rx_frames_per_rates as an array as it really is
    
    commit a3fa71c40f1853d0c27e8f5bc01a722a705d9682 upstream.
    
    In struct wl18xx_acx_rx_rate_stat, rx_frames_per_rates field is an
    array, not a number.  This means WL18XX_DEBUGFS_FWSTATS_FILE can't be
    used to display this field in debugfs (it would display a pointer, not
    the actual data).  Use WL18XX_DEBUGFS_FWSTATS_FILE_ARRAY instead.
    
    This bug has been found by adding a __printf attribute to
    wl1271_format_buffer.  gcc complained about "format '%u' expects
    argument of type 'unsigned int', but argument 5 has type 'u32 *'".

    lib: memzero_explicit: use barrier instead of OPTIMIZER_HIDE_VAR
    
    commit 0b053c9518292705736329a8fe20ef4686ffc8e9 upstream.
    
    OPTIMIZER_HIDE_VAR(), as defined when using gcc, is insufficient to
    ensure protection from dead store optimization.
    
    For the random driver and crypto drivers, calls are emitted ...

    ... but in case in future we might use facilities such as LTO, then
    OPTIMIZER_HIDE_VAR() is not sufficient to protect gcc from a possible
    eviction of the memset(). We have to use a compiler barrier instead.
    
    Minimal test example when we assume memzero_explicit() would *not* be
    a call, but would have been *inlined* instead:
    
      static inline void memzero_explicit(void *s, size_t count)
      {
        memset(s, 0, count);

        printf("%s", buff);
    
        memzero_explicit(buff, sizeof(buff));
        return 0;
      }
    
    With <foo> := OPTIMIZER_HIDE_VAR():
    
      (gdb) disassemble main

    With <foo> := barrier():

    As can be seen, movq, movq, movl are being emitted inlined

    ebpf: verifier: check that call reg with ARG_ANYTHING is initialized
    
    commit 80f1d68ccba70b1060c9c7360ca83da430f66bed upstream.
    
    I noticed that a helper function with argument type ARG_ANYTHING does
    not need to have an initialized value (register).
    
    This can worst case lead to unintented stack memory leakage in future
    helper functions if they are not carefully designed, or unintended
    application behaviour in case the application developer was not careful
    enough to match a correct helper function signature in the API.
    
    The underlying issue is that ARG_ANYTHING should actually be split
    into two different semantics:
    
      1) ARG_DONTCARE for function arguments that the helper function
         does not care about (in other words: the default for unused
         function arguments), and
    
      2) ARG_ANYTHING that is an argument actually being used by a
         helper function and *guaranteed* to be an initialized register.
    
    The current risk is low: ARG_ANYTHING is only used for the 'flags'
    argument (r4) in bpf_map_update_elem() that internally does strict
    checking.

    e1000: add dummy allocator to fix race condition between mtu change and netpoll
    
    commit 08e8331654d1d7b2c58045e549005bc356aa7810 upstream.
    
    There is a race condition between e1000_change_mtu's cleanups and
    netpoll, when we change the MTU across jumbo size:
    
    Changing MTU frees all the rx buffers:
        e1000_change_mtu -> e1000_down -> e1000_clean_all_rx_rings ->
            e1000_clean_rx_ring
    
    Then, close to the end of e1000_change_mtu:
        pr_info -> ... -> netpoll_poll_dev -> e1000_clean ->
            e1000_clean_rx_irq -> e1000_alloc_rx_buffers -> e1000_alloc_frag
    
    And when we come back to do the rest of the MTU change:
        e1000_up -> e1000_configure -> e1000_configure_rx ->
            e1000_alloc_jumbo_rx_buffers
    
    alloc_jumbo finds the buffers already != NULL, since data (shared with
    page in e1000_rx_buffer->rxbuf) has been re-alloc'd, but it's garbage,
    or at least not what is expected when in jumbo state.
    
    This results in an unusable adapter (packets don't get through), and a
    NULL pointer dereference on the next call to e1000_clean_rx_ring
    (other mtu change, link down, shutdown):

    By setting the allocator to a dummy version, netpoll can't mess up our
    rx buffers.  The allocator is set back to a sane value in
    e1000_configure_rx.

    Revert "nfs: replace nfs_add_stats with nfs_inc_stats when add one"
    
    commit 3708f842e107b9b79d54a75d152e666b693649e8 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 5a254d08b086d80cbead2ebcee6d2a4b3a15587a.
    
    Since commit 5a254d08b086 ("nfs: replace nfs_add_stats with
    nfs_inc_stats when add one"), nfs_readpage and nfs_do_writepage use
    nfs_inc_stats to increment NFSIOS_READPAGES and NFSIOS_WRITEPAGES
    instead of nfs_add_stats.
    
    However nfs_inc_stats does not do the same thing as nfs_add_stats with
    value 1 because these functions work on distinct stats:
    nfs_inc_stats increments stats from "enum nfs_stat_eventcounters" (in
    server->io_stats->events) and nfs_add_stats those from "enum
    nfs_stat_bytecounters" (in server->io_stats->bytes).

    Calling unlazy_walk() in walk_component() and do_last() when we find
    a symlink that needs to be followed doesn't acquire a reference to vfsmount.
    That's fine when the symlink is on the same vfsmount as the parent directory
    (which is almost always the case), but it's not always true - one _can_
    manage to bind a symlink on top of something.  And in such cases we end up
    with excessive mntput().

    drm/i915: cope with large i2c transfers
    
    commit 9535c4757b881e06fae72a857485ad57c422b8d2 upstream.
    
    The hardware, according to the specs, is limited to 256 byte transfers,
    and current driver has no protections in case users attempt to do larger
    transfers. The code will just stomp over status register and mayhem
    ensues.
    
    Let's split larger transfers into digestable chunks. Doing this allows
    Atmel MXT driver on Pixel 1 function properly (it hasn't since commit
    9d8dc3e529a19e427fd379118acd132520935c5d "Input: atmel_mxt_ts -

    drm: adv7511: Fix nested sleep when reading EDID
    
    commit a5241289c4139f0521b89e34a70f5f998463ae15 upstream.
    
    The EDID read code waits for the read completion interrupt to occur
    using wait_event_interruptible(). The condition passed to the macro
    reads I2C registers. This results in sleeping with the task state set
    to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, triggering a WARN_ON() introduced in commit
    8eb23b9f35aae ("sched: Debug nested sleeps").
    
    Fix this by reworking the EDID read code. Instead of checking whether
    the read is complete through I2C reads, handle the interrupt registers
    in the interrupt handler and update a new edid_read flag accordingly. As
    a side effect both the IRQ and polling code paths now process the
    interrupt sources through the same code path, simplifying the code.

    tracing: Fix incorrect enabling of trace events by boot cmdline
    
    commit 84fce9db4d7eaebd6cb2ee30c15da6d4e4daf846 upstream.
    
    There is a problem that trace events are not properly enabled with
    boot cmdline. The problem is that if we pass "trace_event=kmem:mm_page_alloc"
    to the boot cmdline, it enables all kmem trace events, and not just
    the page_alloc event.
    
    This is caused by the parsing mechanism. When we parse the cmdline, the buffer
    contents is modified due to tokenization. And, if we use this buffer
    again, we will get the wrong result.
    
    Unfortunately, this buffer is be accessed three times to set trace events
    properly at boot time. So, we need to handle this situation.
    
    There is already code handling ",", but we need another for ":".
    This patch adds it.

    IB/mlx4: Fix WQE LSO segment calculation
    
    commit ca9b590caa17bcbbea119594992666e96cde9c2f upstream.
    
    The current code decreases from the mss size (which is the gso_size
    from the kernel skb) the size of the packet headers.
    
    It shouldn't do that because the mss that comes from the stack
    (e.g IPoIB) includes only the tcp payload without the headers.
    
    The result is indication to the HW that each packet that the HW sends
    is smaller than what it could be, and too many packets will be sent
    for big messages.
    
    An easy way to demonstrate one more aspect of the problem is by
    configuring the ipoib mtu to be less than 2*hlen (2*56) and then
    run app sending big TCP messages. This will tell the HW to send packets
    with giant (negative value which under unsigned arithmetics becomes
    a huge positive one) length and the QP moves to SQE state.

    IB/core: don't disallow registering region starting at 0x0
    
    commit 66578b0b2f69659f00b6169e6fe7377c4b100d18 upstream.
    
    In a call to ib_umem_get(), if address is 0x0 and size is
    already page aligned, check added in commit 8494057ab5e4
    ("IB/uverbs: Prevent integer overflow in ib_umem_get address
    arithmetic") will refuse to register a memory region that
    could otherwise be valid (provided vm.mmap_min_addr sysctl
    and mmap_low_allowed SELinux knobs allow userspace to map
    something at address 0x0).
    
    This patch allows back such registration: ib_umem_get()
    should probably don't care of the base address provided it
    can be pinned with get_user_pages().
    
    There's two possible overflows, in (addr + size) and in
    PAGE_ALIGN(addr + size), this patch keep ensuring none
    of them happen while allowing to pin memory at address
    0x0. Anyway, the case of size equal 0 is no more (partially)
    handled as 0-length memory region are disallowed by an
    earlier check.

    IB/core: disallow registering 0-sized memory region
    
    commit 8abaae62f3fdead8f4ce0ab46b4ab93dee39bab2 upstream.
    
    If ib_umem_get() is called with a size equal to 0 and an
    non-page aligned address, one page will be pinned and a
    0-sized umem will be returned to the caller.
    
    This should not be allowed: it's not expected for a memory

    a 0-sized region.

    mvsas: fix panic on expander attached SATA devices
    
    commit 56cbd0ccc1b508de19561211d7ab9e1c77e6b384 upstream.
    
    mvsas is giving a General protection fault when it encounters an expander
    attached ATA device.  Analysis of mvs_task_prep_ata() shows that the driver is
    assuming all ATA devices are locally attached and obtaining the phy mask by
    indexing the local phy table (in the HBA structure) with the phy id.  Since
    expanders have many more phys than the HBA, this is causing the index into the
    HBA phy table to overflow and returning rubbish as the pointer.
    
    mvs_task_prep_ssp() instead does the phy mask using the port properties.
    Mirror this in mvs_task_prep_ata() to fix the panic.

    dm crypt: fix deadlock when async crypto algorithm returns -EBUSY
    
    commit 0618764cb25f6fa9fb31152995de42a8a0496475 upstream.
    
    I suspect this doesn't show up for most anyone because software
    algorithms typically don't have a sense of being too busy.  However,
    when working with the Freescale CAAM driver it will return -EBUSY on
    occasion under heavy -- which resulted in dm-crypt deadlock.
    
    After checking the logic in some other drivers, the scheme for
    crypt_convert() and it's callback, kcryptd_async_done(), were not
    correctly laid out to properly handle -EBUSY or -EINPROGRESS.
    
    Fix this by using the completion for both -EBUSY and -EINPROGRESS.  Now
    crypt_convert()'s use of completion is comparable to
    af_alg_wait_for_completion().  Similarly, kcryptd_async_done() follows
    the pattern used in af_alg_complete().
    
    Before this fix dm-crypt would lockup within 1-2 minutes running with
    the CAAM driver.  Fix was regression tested against software algorithms
    on PPC32 and x86_64, and things seem perfectly happy there as well.

    clk: qcom: fix RCG M/N counter configuration
    
    commit 0b21503dbbfa669dbd847b33578d4041513cddb2 upstream.
    
    Currently, a RCG's M/N counter (used for fraction division) is
    set to either 'bypass' (counter disabled) or 'dual edge' (counter
    enabled) based on whether the corresponding rcg struct has a mnd
    field specified and a non-zero N.
    
    In the case where M and N are the same value, the M/N counter is
    still enabled by code even though no division takes place.
    Leaving the RCG in such a state can result in improper behavior.
    This was observed with the DSI pixel clock RCG when M and N were
    both set to 1.
    
    Add an additional check (M != N) to enable the M/N counter only
    when it's needed for fraction division.

    clk: tegra: Register the proper number of resets
    
    commit 5e43e259171e1eee8bc074d9c44be434e685087b upstream.
    
    The number of resets controls is 32 times the number of peripheral
    register banks rather than 32 times the number of clocks. This reduces
    (drastically) the number of reset controls registered from 10080 (315
    clocks * 32) to 224 (6 peripheral register banks * 32).
    
    This also fixes a potential crash because trying to use any of the
    excess reset controls (224-10079) would have caused accesses beyond
    the array bounds of the peripheral register banks definition array.

    gpio: mvebu: Fix mask/unmask managment per irq chip type
    
    commit 61819549f572edd7fce53f228c0d8420cdc85f71 upstream.
    
    Level IRQ handlers and edge IRQ handler are managed by tow different
    sets of registers. But currently the driver uses the same mask for the
    both registers. It lead to issues with the following scenario:
    
    First, an IRQ is requested on a GPIO to be triggered on front. After,
    this an other IRQ is requested for a GPIO of the same bank but
    triggered on level. Then the first one will be also setup to be
    triggered on level. It leads to an interrupt storm.
    
    The different kind of handler are already associated with two
    different irq chip type. With this patch the driver uses a private
    mask for each one which solves this issue.
    
    It has been tested on an Armada XP based board and on an Armada 375
    board. For the both boards, with this patch is applied, there is no
    such interrupt storm when running the previous scenario.
    
    This bug was already fixed but in a different way in the legacy
    version of this driver by Evgeniy Dushistov:
    9ece8839b1277fb9128ff6833411614ab6c88d68 "ARM: orion: Fix for certain
    sequence of request_irq can cause irq storm". The fact the new version
    of the gpio drive could be affected had been discussed there:

    xtensa: provide __NR_sync_file_range2 instead of __NR_sync_file_range
    
    commit 01e84c70fe40c8111f960987bcf7f931842e6d07 upstream.
    
    xtensa actually uses sync_file_range2 implementation, so it should
    define __NR_sync_file_range2 as other architectures that use that
    function. That fixes userspace interface (that apparently never worked)
    and avoids special-casing xtensa in libc implementations.
    See the thread ending at
    http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/uclibc/2015-February/048833.html

    xtensa: xtfpga: fix hardware lockup caused by LCD driver
    
    commit 4949009eb8d40a441dcddcd96e101e77d31cf1b2 upstream.
    
    LCD driver is always built for the XTFPGA platform, but its base address
    is not configurable, and is wrong for ML605/KC705. Its initialization
    locks up KC705 board hardware.
    
    Make the whole driver optional, and its base address and bus width
    configurable. Implement 4-bit bus access method.

    ACPICA: Utilities: split IO address types from data type models.
    
    commit 2b8760100e1de69b6ff004c986328a82947db4ad upstream.
    
    ACPICA commit aacf863cfffd46338e268b7415f7435cae93b451
    
    It is reported that on a physically 64-bit addressed machine, 32-bit kernel
    can trigger crashes in accessing the memory regions that are beyond the
    32-bit boundary. The region field's start address should still be 32-bit
    compliant, but after a calculation (adding some offsets), it may exceed the
    32-bit boundary. This case is rare and buggy, but there are real BIOSes
    leaked with such issues (see References below).
    
    This patch fixes this gap by always defining IO addresses as 64-bit, and
    allows OSPMs to optimize it for a real 32-bit machine to reduce the size of
    the internal objects.
    
    Internal acpi_physical_address usages in the structures that can be fixed
    by this change include:
     1. struct acpi_object_region:
        acpi_physical_address               address;
     2. struct acpi_address_range:
        acpi_physical_address               start_address;
        acpi_physical_address               end_address;
     3. struct acpi_mem_space_context;
        acpi_physical_address               address;
     4. struct acpi_table_desc
        acpi_physical_address               address;
    See known issues 1 for other usages.
    
    Note that acpi_io_address which is used for ACPI_PROCESSOR may also suffer
    from same problem, so this patch changes it accordingly.
    
    For iasl, it will enforce acpi_physical_address as 32-bit to generate
    32-bit OSPM compatible tables on 32-bit platforms, we need to define
    ACPI_32BIT_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS for it in acenv.h.
    
    Known issues:
     1. Cleanup of mapped virtual address
       In struct acpi_mem_space_context, acpi_physical_address is used as a virtual
       address:
        acpi_physical_address                   mapped_physical_address;
       It is better to introduce acpi_virtual_address or use acpi_size instead.
       This patch doesn't make such a change. Because this should be done along
       with a change to acpi_os_map_memory()/acpi_os_unmap_memory().
       There should be no functional problem to leave this unchanged except
       that only this structure is enlarged unexpectedly.

    instead of 1764000 and 192000 instead of 19200 (seems to be a typo).

    powerpc: Fix missing L2 cache size in /sys/devices/system/cpu
    
    commit f7e9e358362557c3aa2c1ec47490f29fe880a09e upstream.
    
    This problem appears to have been introduced in 2.6.29 by commit
    93197a36a9c1 "Rewrite sysfs processor cache info code".
    
    This caused lscpu to error out on at least e500v2 devices, eg:
    
      error: cannot open /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index2/size: No such file or directory
    
    Some embedded powerpc systems use cache-size in DTS for the unified L2
    cache size, not d-cache-size, so we need to allow for both DTS names.
    Added a new CACHE_TYPE_UNIFIED_D cache_type_info structure to handle
    this.

    arm64: errata: add workaround for cortex-a53 erratum #845719
    
    commit 905e8c5dcaa147163672b06fe9dcb5abaacbc711 upstream.
    
    When running a compat (AArch32) userspace on Cortex-A53, a load at EL0
    from a virtual address that matches the bottom 32 bits of the virtual
    address used by a recent load at (AArch64) EL1 might return incorrect
    data.
    
    This patch works around the issue by writing to the contextidr_el1
    register on the exception return path when returning to a 32-bit task.
    This workaround is patched in at runtime based on the MIDR value of the
    processor.

    arm64: apply alternatives for !SMP kernels
    
    commit 137650aad96c9594683445e41afa8ac5a2097520 upstream.
    
    Currently we only perform alternative patching for kernels built with
    CONFIG_SMP, as we call apply_alternatives_all() in smp.c, which is only
    built for CONFIG_SMP. Thus !SMP kernels may not have necessary
    alternatives patched in.
    
    This patch ensures that we call apply_alternatives_all() once all CPUs
    are booted, even for !SMP kernels, by having the smp_init_cpus() stub
    call this for !SMP kernels via up_late_init. A new wrapper,
    do_post_cpus_up_work, is added so we can hook other calls here later
    (e.g. boot mode logging).

    arm64: head.S: ensure visibility of page tables
    
    commit 91d57155dc5ab4b311624b7ee570339b6af19ad5 upstream.
    
    After writing the page tables, we use __inval_cache_range to invalidate
    any stale cache entries. Strongly Ordered memory accesses are not
    ordered w.r.t. cache maintenance instructions, and hence explicit memory
    barriers are required to provide this ordering. However,
    __inval_cache_range was written to be used on Normal Cacheable memory
    once the MMU and caches are on, and does not have any barriers prior to
    the DC instructions.
    
    This patch adds a DMB between the page tables being written and the
    corresponding cachelines being invalidated, ensuring that the
    invalidation makes the new data visible to subsequent cacheable
    accesses. A barrier is not required before the prior invalidate as we do
    not access the page table memory area prior to this, and earlier
    barriers in preserve_boot_args and set_cpu_boot_mode_flag ensures
    ordering w.r.t. any stores performed prior to entering Linux.

    Register MIDR_EL1 is masked to get variant and revision fields, then
    compared against midr_range_min and midr_range_max when checking
    whether CPU is affected by any particular erratum. However, variant
    and revision fields in MIDR_EL1 are separated by 16 bits, so the min
    and max of midr range should be constructed accordingly, otherwise
    the patch will not be applied when variant field is non-0.

    Bluetooth: ath3k: Add support Atheros AR5B195 combo Mini PCIe card
    
    commit 2eeff0b4317a02f0e281df891d990194f0737aae upstream.
    
    Add 04f2:aff1 to ath3k.c supported devices list and btusb.c blacklist, so
    that the device can load the ath3k firmware and re-enumerate itself as an
    AR3011 device.

    Before we reach to connection established we may get an

    This hang was a result of a missing command put when

    target/file: Fix SG table for prot_buf initialization
    
    commit c836777830428372074d5129ac513e1472c99791 upstream.
    
    In fd_do_prot_rw(), it allocates prot_buf which is used to copy from
    se_cmd->t_prot_sg by sbc_dif_copy_prot().  The SG table for prot_buf
    is also initialized by allocating 'se_cmd->t_prot_nents' entries of
    scatterlist and setting the data length of each entry to PAGE_SIZE
    at most.
    
    However if se_cmd->t_prot_sg contains a clustered entry (i.e.
    sg->length > PAGE_SIZE), the SG table for prot_buf can't be
    initialized correctly and sbc_dif_copy_prot() can't copy to prot_buf.
    (This actually happened with TCM loopback fabric module)
    
    As prot_buf is allocated by kzalloc() and it's physically contiguous,
    we only need a single scatterlist entry.

    target/file: Fix UNMAP with DIF protection support
    
    commit 64d240b721b21e266ffde645ec965c3b6d1c551f upstream.
    
    When UNMAP command is issued with DIF protection support enabled,
    the protection info for the unmapped region is remain unchanged.
    So READ command for the region causes data integrity failure.
    
    This fixes it by invalidating protection info for the unmapped region
    by filling with 0xff pattern.  This change also adds helper function
    fd_do_prot_fill() in order to reduce code duplication with existing
    fd_format_prot().

    target/file: Fix BUG() when CONFIG_DEBUG_SG=y and DIF protection enabled
    
    commit 38da0f49e8aa1649af397d53f88e163d0e60c058 upstream.
    
    When CONFIG_DEBUG_SG=y and DIF protection support enabled, kernel
    BUG()s are triggered due to the following two issues:
    
    1) prot_sg is not initialized by sg_init_table().
    
    When CONFIG_DEBUG_SG=y, scatterlist helpers check sg entry has a
    correct magic value.
    
    2) vmalloc'ed buffer is passed to sg_set_buf().
    
    sg_set_buf() uses virt_to_page() to convert virtual address to struct
    page, but it doesn't work with vmalloc address.  vmalloc_to_page()
    should be used instead.  As prot_buf isn't usually too large, so
    fix it by allocating prot_buf by kmalloc instead of vmalloc.

    target: Fix COMPARE_AND_WRITE with SG_TO_MEM_NOALLOC handling
    
    commit c8e639852ad720499912acedfd6b072325fd2807 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a bug for COMPARE_AND_WRITE handling with
    fabrics using SCF_PASSTHROUGH_SG_TO_MEM_NOALLOC.
    
    It adds the missing allocation for cmd->t_bidi_data_sg within
    transport_generic_new_cmd() that is used by COMPARE_AND_WRITE
    for the initial READ payload, even if the fabric is already
    providing a pre-allocated buffer for cmd->t_data_sg.
    
    Also, fix zero-length COMPARE_AND_WRITE handling within the
    compare_and_write_callback() and target_complete_ok_work()
    to queue the response, skipping the initial READ.
    
    This fixes COMPARE_AND_WRITE emulation with loopback, vhost,
    and xen-backend fabric drivers using SG_TO_MEM_NOALLOC.

    This uninitialized variable doesn't have much visible effect in the end,

    tools/power turbostat: Use $(CURDIR) instead of $(PWD) and add support for O= option in Makefile
    
    commit f82263c6989c31ae9b94cecddffb29dcbec38710 upstream.
    
    Since commit ee0778a30153
    ("tools/power: turbostat: make Makefile a bit more capable")
    turbostat's Makefile is using
    
      [...]
      BUILD_OUTPUT    := $(PWD)
      [...]
    
    which obviously causes trouble when building "turbostat" with
    
      make -C /usr/src/linux/tools/power/x86/turbostat ARCH=x86 turbostat
    
    because GNU make does not update nor guarantee that $PWD is set.
    
    This patch changes the Makefile to use $CURDIR instead, which GNU make
    guarantees to set and update (i.e. when using "make -C ...") and also
    adds support for the O= option (see "make help" in your root of your
    kernel source tree for more details).

    tools lib traceevent kbuffer: Remove extra update to data pointer in PADDING
    
    commit c5e691928bf166ac03430e957038b60adba3cf6c upstream.
    
    When a event PADDING is hit (a deleted event that is still in the ring
    buffer), translate_data() sets the length of the padding and also updates
    the data pointer which is passed back to the caller.
    
    This is unneeded because the caller also updates the data pointer with
    the passed back length. translate_data() should not update the pointer,
    only set the length.

    mnt: Don't propagate umounts in __detach_mounts
    
    commit 8318e667f176f7ea34451a1a530634e293f216ac upstream.
    
    Invoking mount propagation from __detach_mounts is inefficient and
    wrong.
    
    It is inefficient because __detach_mounts already walks the list of
    mounts that where something needs to be done, and mount propagation
    walks some subset of those mounts again.
    
    It is actively wrong because if the dentry that is passed to
    __detach_mounts is not part of the path to a mount that mount should
    not be affected.
    
    change_mnt_propagation(p,MS_PRIVATE) modifies the mount propagation
    tree of a master mount so it's slaves are connected to another master
    if possible.  Which means even removing a mount from the middle of a
    mount tree with __detach_mounts will not deprive any mount propagated
    mount events.

    mnt: Improve the umount_tree flags
    
    commit e819f152104c9f7c9fe50e1aecce6f5d4bf06d65 upstream.
    
    - Remove the unneeded declaration from pnode.h
    - Mark umount_tree static as it has no callers outside of namespace.c
    - Define an enumeration of umount_tree's flags.
    - Pass umount_tree's flags in by name
    
    This removes the magic numbers 0, 1 and 2 making the code a little
    clearer and makes it possible for there to be lazy unmounts that don't
    propagate.  Which is what __detach_mounts actually wants for example.

    ext4: make fsync to sync parent dir in no-journal for real this time
    
    commit e12fb97222fc41e8442896934f76d39ef99b590a upstream.
    
    Previously commit 14ece1028b3ed53ffec1b1213ffc6acaf79ad77c added a
    support for for syncing parent directory of newly created inodes to
    make sure that the inode is not lost after a power failure in
    no-journal mode.
    
    However this does not work in majority of cases, namely:
     - if the directory has inline data
     - if the directory is already indexed
     - if the directory already has at least one block and:
            - the new entry fits into it
            - or we've successfully converted it to indexed
    
    So in those cases we might lose the inode entirely even after fsync in
    the no-journal mode. This also includes ext2 default mode obviously.
    
    I've noticed this while running xfstest generic/321 and even though the
    test should fail (we need to run fsck after a crash in no-journal mode)
    I could not find a newly created entries even when if it was fsynced
    before.
    
    Fix this by adjusting the ext4_add_entry() successful exit paths to set
    the inode EXT4_STATE_NEWENTRY so that fsync has the chance to fsync the
    parent directory as well.

    ptrace: fix race between ptrace_resume() and wait_task_stopped()
    
    commit b72c186999e689cb0b055ab1c7b3cd8fffbeb5ed upstream.
    
    ptrace_resume() is called when the tracee is still __TASK_TRACED.  We set
    tracee->exit_code and then wake_up_state() changes tracee->state.  If the
    tracer's sub-thread does wait() in between, task_stopped_code(ptrace => T)
    wrongly looks like another report from tracee.
    
    This confuses debugger, and since wait_task_stopped() clears ->exit_code
    the tracee can miss a signal.
    
    Test-case:
    
            #include <stdio.h>
            #include <unistd.h>
            #include <sys/wait.h>
            #include <sys/ptrace.h>
            #include <pthread.h>
            #include <assert.h>
    
            int pid;
    
            void *waiter(void *arg)
            {
                    int stat;
    
                    for (;;) {
                            assert(pid == wait(&stat));
                            assert(WIFSTOPPED(stat));
                            if (WSTOPSIG(stat) == SIGHUP)
                                    continue;
    
                            assert(WSTOPSIG(stat) == SIGCONT);
                            printf("ERR! extra/wrong report:%x\n", stat);
                    }
            }
    
            int main(void)
            {
                    pthread_t thread;
    
                    pid = fork();
                    if (!pid) {
                            assert(ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0,0,0) == 0);
                            for (;;)
                                    kill(getpid(), SIGHUP);
                    }
    
                    assert(pthread_create(&thread, NULL, waiter, NULL) == 0);
    
                    for (;;)
                            ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, pid, 0, SIGCONT);
    
                    return 0;
            }
    
    Note for stable: the bug is very old, but without 9899d11f6544 "ptrace:
    ensure arch_ptrace/ptrace_request can never race with SIGKILL" the fix
    should use lock_task_sighand(child).

    fs/binfmt_elf.c: fix bug in loading of PIE binaries
    
    commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 upstream.
    
    With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down
    address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE
    binary into an address range immediately below mm->mmap_base.
    
    Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to
    allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while
    the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm->mmap_base, the subsequent
    PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm->mmap_base into the are
    that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.
    
    Since the size of the "gap" on x86_64 is only guaranteed to be 128MB this
    means that binaries with large data segments > 128MB can end up mapping
    part of their data segment over their stack resulting in corruption of the
    stack (and the data segment once the binary starts to run).
    
    Any PIE binary with a data segment > 128MB is vulnerable to this although
    address randomization means that the actual gap between the stack and the
    end of the binary is normally greater than 128MB.  The larger the data
    segment of the binary the higher the probability of failure.
    
    Fix this by calculating the total size of the binary in the same way as
    load_elf_interp().

    mfd: core: Fix platform-device name collisions
    
    commit a77c50b44cfb663ad03faba9800fec19bdf83577 upstream.
    
    Since commit 6e3f62f0793e ("mfd: core: Fix platform-device id
    generation") we honour PLATFORM_DEVID_AUTO and PLATFORM_DEVID_NONE when
    registering mfd-devices.
    
    Unfortunately, some mfd-drivers rely on the old behaviour of generating
    platform-device ids by adding the cell id also to the special value of
    PLATFORM_DEVID_NONE. The resulting platform ids are not only used to
    generate device-unique names, but are also used instead of the cell id
    to identify cells when probing subdevices.
    
    These drivers should be updated to use PLATFORM_DEVID_AUTO, which would
    also allow more than one device to be registered without resorting to
    hacks (see for example wm831x), but lets fix the regression first by
    partially reverting the above mentioned commit with respect to
    PLATFORM_DEVID_NONE.

    Input: elantech - fix absolute mode setting on some ASUS laptops
    
    commit bd884149aca61de269fd9bad83fe2a4232ffab21 upstream.
    
    On ASUS TP500LN and X750JN, the touchpad absolute mode is reset each
    time set_rate is done.
    
    In order to fix this, we will verify the firmware version, and if it
    matches the one in those laptops, the set_rate function is overloaded
    with a function elantech_set_rate_restore_reg_07 that performs the
    set_rate with the original function, followed by a restore of reg_07
    (the register that sets the absolute mode on elantech v4 hardware).
    
    Also the ASUS TP500LN and X750JN firmware version, capabilities, and
    button constellation is added to elantech.c

    usb: define a generic USB_RESUME_TIMEOUT macro
    
    commit 62f0342de1f012f3e90607d39e20fce811391169 upstream.
    
    Every USB Host controller should use this new
    macro to define for how long resume signalling
    should be driven on the bus.
    
    Currently, almost every single USB controller
    is using a 20ms timeout for resume signalling.
    
    That's problematic for two reasons:
    
    a) sometimes that 20ms timer expires a little
    before 20ms, which makes us fail certification
    
    b) some (many) devices actually need more than
    20ms resume signalling.
    
    Sure, in case of (b) we can state that the device
    is against the USB spec, but the fact is that
    we have no control over which device the certification
    lab will use. We also have no control over which host
    they will use. Most likely they'll be using a Windows
    PC which, again, we have no control over how that
    USB stack is written and how long resume signalling
    they are using.
    
    At the end of the day, we must make sure Linux passes
    electrical compliance when working as Host or as Device
    and currently we don't pass compliance as host because
    we're driving resume signallig for exactly 20ms and
    that confuses certification test setup resulting in
    Certification failure.

    ARM: 8320/1: fix integer overflow in ELF_ET_DYN_BASE
    
    commit 8defb3367fcd19d1af64c07792aade0747b54e0f upstream.
    
    Usually ELF_ET_DYN_BASE is 2/3 of TASK_SIZE. With 3G/1G user/kernel
    split this is not so, because 2*TASK_SIZE overflows 32 bits,
    so the actual value of ELF_ET_DYN_BASE is:
            (2 * TASK_SIZE / 3) = 0x2a000000
    
    When ASLR is disabled PIE binaries will load at ELF_ET_DYN_BASE address.
    On 32bit platforms AddressSanitzer uses addresses [0x20000000 - 0x40000000]
    for shadow memory [1]. So ASan doesn't work for PIE binaries when ASLR disabled
    as it fails to map shadow memory.
    Also after Kees's 'split ET_DYN ASLR from mmap ASLR' patchset PIE binaries
    has a high chance of loading somewhere in between [0x2a000000 - 0x40000000]
    even if ASLR enabled. This makes ASan with PIE absolutely incompatible.
    
    Fix overflow by dividing TASK_SIZE prior to multiplying.
    After this patch ELF_ET_DYN_BASE equals to (for CONFIG_VMSPLIT_3G=y):
            (TASK_SIZE / 3 * 2) = 0x7f555554

    ARM: fix broken hibernation
    
    commit 767bf7e7a1e82a81c59778348d156993d0a6175d upstream.
    
    Normally, when a CPU wants to clear a cache line to zero in the external
    L2 cache, it would generate bus cycles to write each word as it would do
    with any other data access.
    
    However, a Cortex A9 connected to a L2C-310 has a specific feature where
    the CPU can detect this operation, and signal that it wants to zero an
    entire cache line.  This feature, known as Full Line of Zeros (FLZ),
    involves a non-standard AXI signalling mechanism which only the L2C-310
    can properly interpret.
    
    There are separate enable bits in both the L2C-310 and the Cortex A9 -
    the L2C-310 needs to be enabled and have the FLZ enable bit set in the
    auxiliary control register before the Cortex A9 has this feature
    enabled.
    
    Unfortunately, the suspend code was not respecting this - it's not
    obvious from the code:
    
    swsusp_arch_suspend()
     cpu_suspend() /* saves the Cortex A9 auxiliary control register */
      arch_save_image()
      soft_restart() /* turns off FLZ in Cortex A9, and disables L2C */
       cpu_resume() /* restores the Cortex A9 registers, inc auxcr */
    
    At this point, we end up with the L2C disabled, but the Cortex A9 with
    FLZ enabled - which means any memset() or zeroing of a full cache line
    will fail to take effect.
    
    A similar issue exists in the resume path, but it's slightly more
    complex:
    
    swsusp_arch_suspend()
     cpu_suspend() /* saves the Cortex A9 auxiliary control register */
      arch_save_image() /* image with A9 auxcr saved */
    ...
    swsusp_arch_resume()
     call_with_stack()
      arch_restore_image() /* restores image with A9 auxcr saved above */
      soft_restart() /* turns off FLZ in Cortex A9, and disables L2C */
       cpu_resume() /* restores the Cortex A9 registers, inc auxcr */
    
    Again, here we end up with the L2C disabled, but Cortex A9 FLZ enabled.
    
    There's no need to turn off the L2C in either of these two paths; there
    are benefits from not doing so - for example, the page copies will be
    faster with the L2C enabled.
    
    Hence, fix this by providing a variant of soft_restart() which can be
    used without turning the L2 cache controller off, and use it in both
    of these paths to keep the L2C enabled across the respective resume
    transitions.

    NFS: fix BUG() crash in notify_change() with patch to chown_common()
    
    commit c1b8940b42bb6487b10f2267a96b486276ce9ff7 upstream.
    
    We have observed a BUG() crash in fs/attr.c:notify_change(). The crash
    occurs during an rsync into a filesystem that is exported via NFS.
    
    1.) fs/attr.c:notify_change() modifies the caller's version of attr.
    2.) 6de0ec00ba8d ("VFS: make notify_change pass ATTR_KILL_S*ID to
        setattr operations") introduced a BUG() restriction such that "no
        function will ever call notify_change() with both ATTR_MODE and
        ATTR_KILL_S*ID set". Under some circumstances though, it will have
        assisted in setting the caller's version of attr to this very
        combination.
    3.) 27ac0ffeac80 ("locks: break delegations on any attribute
        modification") introduced code to handle breaking
        delegations. This can result in notify_change() being re-called. attr
        _must_ be explicitly reset to avoid triggering the BUG() established
        in #2.
    4.) The path that that triggers this is via fs/open.c:chmod_common().
        The combination of attr flags set here and in the first call to
        notify_change() along with a later failed break_deleg_wait()
        results in notify_change() being called again via retry_deleg
        without resetting attr.
    
    Solution is to move retry_deleg in chmod_common() a bit further up to
    ensure attr is completely reset.
    
    There are other places where this seemingly could occur, such as
    fs/utimes.c:utimes_common(), but the attr flags are not initially
    set in such a way to trigger this.

    power_supply: ipaq_micro_battery: Check return values in probe
    
    commit a2c1d531854c4319610f1d83351213b47a633969 upstream.
    
    The return values of create_singlethread_workqueue() and
    power_supply_register() calls were not checked and even on error probe()
    function returned 0.
    
    1. If allocation of workqueue failed (returning NULL) then further
       accesses could lead to NULL pointer dereference. The
       queue_delayed_work() expects workqueue to be non-NULL.
    
    2. If registration of power supply failed then during unbind the driver
       tried to unregister power supply which was not actually registered.
       This could lead to memory corruption because
       power_supply_unregister() unconditionally cleans up given power
       supply.

    ring-buffer: Replace this_cpu_*() with __this_cpu_*()
    
    commit 80a9b64e2c156b6523e7a01f2ba6e5d86e722814 upstream.
    
    It has come to my attention that this_cpu_read/write are horrible on
    architectures other than x86. Worse yet, they actually disable
    preemption or interrupts! This caused some unexpected tracing results
    on ARM.
    
       101.356868: preempt_count_add <-ring_buffer_lock_reserve
       101.356870: preempt_count_sub <-ring_buffer_lock_reserve
    
    The ring_buffer_lock_reserve has recursion protection that requires
    accessing a per cpu variable. But since preempt_disable() is traced, it
    too got traced while accessing the variable that is suppose to prevent
    recursion like this.
    
    The generic version of this_cpu_read() and write() are:
    
     #define this_cpu_generic_read(pcp)                                     \
     ({     typeof(pcp) ret__;                                              \
            preempt_disable();                                              \
            ret__ = *this_cpu_ptr(&(pcp));                                  \
            preempt_enable();                                               \
            ret__;                                                          \
     })
    
     #define this_cpu_generic_to_op(pcp, val, op)                           \
     do {                                                                   \
            unsigned long flags;                                            \
            raw_local_irq_save(flags);                                      \
            *__this_cpu_ptr(&(pcp)) op val;                                 \
            raw_local_irq_restore(flags);                                   \
     } while (0)
    
    Which is unacceptable for locations that know they are within preempt
    disabled or interrupt disabled locations.
    
    Paul McKenney stated that __this_cpu_() versions produce much better code on
    other architectures than this_cpu_() does, if we know that the call is done in
    a preempt disabled location.
    
    I also changed the recursive_unlock() to use two local variables instead
    of accessing the per_cpu variable twice.

    spi: spidev: fix possible arithmetic overflow for multi-transfer message
    
    commit f20fbaad7620af2df36a1f9d1c9ecf48ead5b747 upstream.
    
    `spidev_message()` sums the lengths of the individual SPI transfers to
    determine the overall SPI message length.  It restricts the total
    length, returning an error if too long, but it does not check for
    arithmetic overflow.  For example, if the SPI message consisted of two
    transfers and the first has a length of 10 and the second has a length
    of (__u32)(-1), the total length would be seen as 9, even though the
    second transfer is actually very long.  If the second transfer specifies
    a null `rx_buf` and a non-null `tx_buf`, the `copy_from_user()` could
    overrun the spidev's pre-allocated tx buffer before it reaches an
    invalid user memory address.  Fix it by checking that neither the total
    nor the individual transfer lengths exceed the maximum allowed value.
    
    Thanks to Dan Carpenter for reporting the potential integer overflow.

    spi: imx: read back the RX/TX watermark levels earlier
    
    commit f511ab09dfb0fe7b2335eccac51ff9f001a32e4a upstream.
    
    They are used to decide if the controller can do DMA on a buffer
    of a specific length and thus are needed before any transfer is attempted.
    
    This fixes a memory leak where the SPI core uses the drivers can_dma()
    callback to determine if a buffer needs to be mapped. As the watermark
    levels aren't correct at that point the driver falsely claims to be able to
    DMA the buffer when it fact it isn't.
    After the transfer has been done the core uses the same callback to
    determine if it needs to unmap the buffers. As the driver now correctly
    claims to not being able to DMA the buffer the core doesn't attempt to
    unmap the buffer which leaves the SGT leaking.

    drivers/base: cacheinfo: validate device node for all the caches
    
    commit 8a7d95f95c95f396decbd4cda6d4903fc4664946 upstream.
    
    On architectures that depend on DT for obtaining cache hierarcy, we need
    to validate the device node for all the cache indices, failing to do so
    might result in wrong information being exposed to the userspace.
    
    This is quite possible on initial/incomplete versions of the device
    trees. In such cases, it's better to bail out if all the required device
    nodes are not present.
    
    This patch adds checks for the validation of device node for all the
    caches and doesn't initialise the cacheinfo if there's any error.

    staging: android: sync: Fix memory corruption in sync_timeline_signal().
    
    commit 8e43c9c75faf2902955bd2ecd7a50a8cc41cb00a upstream.
    
    The android_fence_release() function checks for active sync points
    by calling list_empty() on the list head embedded on the sync
    point. However, it is only valid to use list_empty() on nodes that
    have been initialized with INIT_LIST_HEAD() or list_del_init().
    
    Because the list entry has likely been removed from the active list
    by sync_timeline_signal(), there is a good chance that this
    WARN_ON_ONCE() will be hit due to dangling pointers pointing at
    freed memory (even though the sync drivers did nothing wrong)
    and memory corruption will ensue as the list entry is removed for
    a second time, corrupting the active list.
    
    This problem can be reproduced quite easily with CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST=y
    and fences with more than one sync point.

    Now values are corrected with referenece to the values defined in

    MIPS: Hibernate: flush TLB entries earlier
    
    commit a843d00d038b11267279e3b5388222320f9ddc1d upstream.
    
    We found that TLB mismatch not only happens after kernel resume, but
    also happens during snapshot restore. So move it to the beginning of
    swsusp_arch_suspend().

    MIPS: Loongson-3: Add IRQF_NO_SUSPEND to Cascade irqaction
    
    commit 0add9c2f1cff9f3f1f2eb7e9babefa872a9d14b9 upstream.
    
    HPET irq is routed to i8259 and then to MIPS CPU irq (cascade). After
    commit a3e6c1eff5 (MIPS: IRQ: Fix disable_irq on CPU IRQs), if without
    IRQF_NO_SUSPEND in cascade_irqaction, HPET interrupts will lost during
    suspend. The result is machine cannot be waken up.

    MIPS: Malta: Detect and fix bad memsize values
    
    commit f7f8aea4b97c4d48e42f02cb37026bee445f239f upstream.
    
    memsize denotes the amount of RAM we can access from kseg{0,1} and
    that should be up to 256M. In case the bootloader reports a value
    higher than that (perhaps reporting all the available RAM) it's best
    if we fix it ourselves and just warn the user about that. This is
    usually a problem with the bootloader and/or its environment.

    MIPS: lose_fpu(): Disable FPU when MSA enabled
    
    commit acaf6a97d623af123314c2f8ce4cf7254f6b2fc1 upstream.
    
    The lose_fpu() function only disables the FPU in CP0_Status.CU1 if the
    FPU is in use and MSA isn't enabled.
    
    This isn't necessarily a problem because KSTK_STATUS(current), the
    version of CP0_Status stored on the kernel stack on entry from user
    mode, does always get updated and gets restored when returning to user
    mode, but I don't think it was intended, and it is inconsistent with the
    case of only the FPU being in use. Sometimes leaving the FPU enabled may
    also mask kernel bugs where FPU operations are executed when the FPU
    might not be enabled.
    
    So lets disable the FPU in the MSA case too.

    MIPS: KVM: Handle MSA Disabled exceptions from guest
    
    commit 98119ad53376885819d93dfb8737b6a9a61ca0ba upstream.
    
    Guest user mode can generate a guest MSA Disabled exception on an MSA
    capable core by simply trying to execute an MSA instruction. Since this
    exception is unknown to KVM it will be passed on to the guest kernel.
    However guest Linux kernels prior to v3.15 do not set up an exception
    handler for the MSA Disabled exception as they don't support any MSA
    capable cores. This results in a guest OS panic.
    
    Since an older processor ID may be being emulated, and MSA support is
    not advertised to the guest, the correct behaviour is to generate a
    Reserved Instruction exception in the guest kernel so it can send the
    guest process an illegal instruction signal (SIGILL), as would happen
    with a non-MSA-capable core.
    
    Fix this as minimally as reasonably possible by preventing
    kvm_mips_check_privilege() from relaying MSA Disabled exceptions from
    guest user mode to the guest kernel, and handling the MSA Disabled
    exception by emulating a Reserved Instruction exception in the guest,
    via a new handle_msa_disabled() KVM callback.

    arm/arm64: KVM: Keep elrsr/aisr in sync with software model
    
    commit ae705930fca6322600690df9dc1c7d0516145a93 upstream.
    
    There is an interesting bug in the vgic code, which manifests itself
    when the KVM run loop has a signal pending or needs a vmid generation
    rollover after having disabled interrupts but before actually switching
    to the guest.
    
    In this case, we flush the vgic as usual, but we sync back the vgic
    state and exit to userspace before entering the guest.  The consequence
    is that we will be syncing the list registers back to the software model
    using the GICH_ELRSR and GICH_EISR from the last execution of the guest,
    potentially overwriting a list register containing an interrupt.
    
    This showed up during migration testing where we would capture a state
    where the VM has masked the arch timer but there were no interrupts,
    resulting in a hung test.

    arm64: KVM: Do not use pgd_index to index stage-2 pgd
    
    commit 04b8dc85bf4a64517e3cf20e409eeaa503b15cc1 upstream.
    
    The kernel's pgd_index macro is designed to index a normal, page
    sized array. KVM is a bit diffferent, as we can use concatenated
    pages to have a bigger address space (for example 40bit IPA with
    4kB pages gives us an 8kB PGD.
    
    In the above case, the use of pgd_index will always return an index
    inside the first 4kB, which makes a guest that has memory above
    0x8000000000 rather unhappy, as it spins forever in a page fault,
    whist the host happilly corrupts the lower pgd.
    
    The obvious fix is to get our own kvm_pgd_index that does the right
    thing(tm).
    
    Tested on X-Gene with a hacked kvmtool that put memory at a stupidly
    high address.

    arm64: KVM: Fix stage-2 PGD allocation to have per-page refcounting
    
    commit a987370f8e7a1677ae385042644326d9cd145a20 upstream.
    
    We're using __get_free_pages with to allocate the guest's stage-2
    PGD. The standard behaviour of this function is to return a set of
    pages where only the head page has a valid refcount.
    
    This behaviour gets us into trouble when we're trying to increment
    the refcount on a non-head page:
    
    page:ffff7c00cfb693c0 count:0 mapcount:0 mapping:          (null) index:0x0

    page dumped because: VM_BUG_ON_PAGE((*({ __attribute__((unused)) typeof((&page->_count)->counter) __var = ( typeof((&page->_count)->counter)) 0; (volatile typeof((&page->_count)->counter) *)&((&page->_count)->counter); })) <= 0)

    A possible approach for this is to split the compound page using
    split_page() at allocation time, and change the teardown path to
    free one page at a time.  It turns out that alloc_pages_exact() and
    free_pages_exact() does exactly that.
    
    While we're at it, the PGD allocation code is reworked to reduce
    duplication.
    
    This has been tested on an X-Gene platform with a 4kB/48bit-VA host
    kernel, and kvmtool hacked to place memory in the second page of
    the hardware PGD (PUD for the host kernel). Also regression-tested
    on a Cubietruck (Cortex-A7).

    KVM: arm/arm64: check IRQ number on userland injection
    
    commit fd1d0ddf2ae92fb3df42ed476939861806c5d785 upstream.
    
    When userland injects a SPI via the KVM_IRQ_LINE ioctl we currently
    only check it against a fixed limit, which historically is set
    to 127. With the new dynamic IRQ allocation the effective limit may
    actually be smaller (64).
    So when now a malicious or buggy userland injects a SPI in that
    range, we spill over on our VGIC bitmaps and bytemaps memory.
    I could trigger a host kernel NULL pointer dereference with current
    mainline by injecting some bogus IRQ number from a hacked kvmtool:
    -----------------
    ....
    DEBUG: kvm_vgic_inject_irq(kvm, cpu=0, irq=114, level=1)
    DEBUG: vgic_update_irq_pending(kvm, cpu=0, irq=114, level=1)
    DEBUG: IRQ #114 still in the game, writing to bytemap now...
    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000

    .....
    
    So this patch fixes this by checking the SPI number against the
    actual limit. Also we remove the former legacy hard limit of
    127 in the ioctl code.

    s390/hibernate: fix save and restore of kernel text section
    
    commit d74419495633493c9cd3f2bbeb7f3529d0edded6 upstream.
    
    Sebastian reported a crash caused by a jump label mismatch after resume.
    This happens because we do not save the kernel text section during suspend
    and therefore also do not restore it during resume, but use the kernel image
    that restores the old system.
    
    This means that after a suspend/resume cycle we lost all modifications done
    to the kernel text section.
    The reason for this is the pfn_is_nosave() function, which incorrectly
    returns that read-only pages don't need to be saved. This is incorrect since
    we mark the kernel text section read-only.
    We still need to make sure to not save and restore pages contained within
    NSS and DCSS segment.
    To fix this add an extra case for the kernel text section and only save
    those pages if they are not contained within an NSS segment.
    
    Fixes the following crash (and the above bugs as well):

    KVM: s390: fix get_all_floating_irqs
    
    commit 94aa033efcac47b09db22cb561e135baf37b7887 upstream.
    
    This fixes a bug introduced with commit c05c4186bbe4 ("KVM: s390:
    add floating irq controller").
    
    get_all_floating_irqs() does copy_to_user() while holding
    a spin lock. Let's fix this by filling a temporary buffer
    first and copy it to userspace after giving up the lock.

    KVM: s390: no need to hold the kvm->mutex for floating interrupts
    
    commit 69a8d456263849152826542c7cb0a164b90e68a8 upstream.
    
    The kvm mutex was (probably) used to protect against cpu hotplug.
    The current code no longer needs to protect against that, as we only
    rely on CPU data structures that are guaranteed to be available
    if we can access the CPU. (e.g. vcpu_create will put the cpu
    in the array AFTER the cpu is ready).

    KVM: s390: reinjection of irqs can fail in the tpi handler
    
    commit 15462e37ca848abac7477dece65f8af25febd744 upstream.
    
    The reinjection of an I/O interrupt can fail if the list is at the limit
    and between the dequeue and the reinjection, another I/O interrupt is
    injected (e.g. if user space floods kvm with I/O interrupts).
    
    This patch avoids this memory leak and returns -EFAULT in this special
    case. This error is not recoverable, so let's fail hard. This can later
    be avoided by not dequeuing the interrupt but working directly on the
    locked list.

    commit 261520dcfcba93ca5dfe671b88ffab038cd940c8 upstream.
    
    If the I/O interrupt could not be written to the guest provided
    area (e.g. access exception), a program exception was injected into the
    guest but "inti" wasn't freed, therefore resulting in a memory leak.
    
    In addition, the I/O interrupt wasn't reinjected. Therefore the dequeued
    interrupt is lost.

    cc and rc logic easier to handle.

    usb: gadget: printer: enqueue printer's response for setup request
    
    commit eb132ccbdec5df46e29c9814adf76075ce83576b upstream.
    
    Function-specific setup requests should be handled in such a way, that
    apart from filling in the data buffer, the requests are also actually
    enqueued: if function-specific setup is called from composte_setup(),
    the "usb_ep_queue()" block of code in composite_setup() is skipped.
    
    The printer function lacks this part and it results in e.g. get device id
    requests failing: the host expects some response, the device prepares it
    but does not equeue it for sending to the host, so the host finally asserts
    timeout.
    
    This patch adds enqueueing the prepared responses.

    Btrfs: fix inode eviction infinite loop after extent_same ioctl
    
    commit 113e8283869b9855c8b999796aadd506bbac155f upstream.
    
    If we pass a length of 0 to the extent_same ioctl, we end up locking an
    extent range with a start offset greater then its end offset (if the
    destination file's offset is greater than zero). This results in a warning
    from extent_io.c:insert_state through the following call chain:
    
      btrfs_extent_same()
        btrfs_double_lock()
          lock_extent_range()
            lock_extent(inode->io_tree, offset, offset + len - 1)
              lock_extent_bits()
                __set_extent_bit()
                  insert_state()
                    --> WARN_ON(end < start)
    
    This leads to an infinite loop when evicting the inode. This is the same
    problem that my previous patch titled
    "Btrfs: fix inode eviction infinite loop after cloning into it" addressed
    but for the extent_same ioctl instead of the clone ioctl.

    So just bail out of the clone ioctl if the length of the region to clone
    is zero, without locking any extent range, in order to prevent this issue
    (same behaviour as a pwrite with a 0 length for example).
    
    This is trivial to reproduce. For example, the steps for the test I just
    made for fstests:
    
      mkfs.btrfs -f SCRATCH_DEV
      mount SCRATCH_DEV $SCRATCH_MNT
    
      touch $SCRATCH_MNT/foo
      touch $SCRATCH_MNT/bar
    
      $CLONER_PROG -s 0 -d 4096 -l 0 $SCRATCH_MNT/foo $SCRATCH_MNT/bar
      umount $SCRATCH_MNT
    
    A test case for fstests follows soon.

    Btrfs: fix log tree corruption when fs mounted with -o discard
    
    commit dcc82f4783ad91d4ab654f89f37ae9291cdc846a upstream.
    
    While committing a transaction we free the log roots before we write the
    new super block. Freeing the log roots implies marking the disk location
    of every node/leaf (metadata extent) as pinned before the new super block
    is written. This is to prevent the disk location of log metadata extents
    from being reused before the new super block is written, otherwise we
    would have a corrupted log tree if before the new super block is written
    a crash/reboot happens and the location of any log tree metadata extent
    ended up being reused and rewritten.
    
    Even though we pinned the log tree's metadata extents, we were issuing a
    discard against them if the fs was mounted with the -o discard option,
    resulting in corruption of the log tree if a crash/reboot happened before
    writing the new super block - the next time the fs was mounted, during
    the log replay process we would find nodes/leafs of the log btree with
    a content full of zeroes, causing the process to fail and require the
    use of the tool btrfs-zero-log to wipeout the log tree (and all data
    previously fsynced becoming lost forever).
    
    Fix this by not doing a discard when pinning an extent. The discard will
    be done later when it's safe (after the new super block is committed) at
    extent-tree.c:btrfs_finish_extent_commit().

    improves significantly:
    
      3.8.13                   487.2 KHz    1.000

    sched/idle/x86: Restore mwait_idle() to fix boot hangs, to improve power savings and to improve performance
    
    commit b253149b843f89cd300cbdbea27ce1f847506f99 upstream.
    
    In Linux-3.9 we removed the mwait_idle() loop:
    
      69fb3676df33 ("x86 idle: remove mwait_idle() and "idle=mwait" cmdline param")
    
    The reasoning was that modern machines should be sufficiently
    happy during the boot process using the default_idle() HALT
    loop, until cpuidle loads and either acpi_idle or intel_idle
    invoke the newer MWAIT-with-hints idle loop.
    
    But two machines reported problems:
    
     1. Certain Core2-era machines support MWAIT-C1 and HALT only.
        MWAIT-C1 is preferred for optimal power and performance.
        But if they support just C1, cpuidle never loads and
        so they use the boot-time default idle loop forever.
    
     2. Some laptops will boot-hang if HALT is used,
        but will boot successfully if MWAIT is used.
        This appears to be a hidden assumption in BIOS SMI,
        that is presumably valid on the proprietary OS
        where the BIOS was validated.
    
           https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60770
    
    So here we effectively revert the patch above, restoring
    the mwait_idle() loop.  However, we don't bother restoring
    the idle=mwait cmdline parameter, since it appears to add
    no value.
    
    Maintainer notes:
    
      For 3.9, simply revert 69fb3676df
      for 3.10, patch -F3 applies, fuzz needed due to __cpuinit use in
      context For 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, this patch applies cleanly

    x86/asm/decoder: Fix and enforce max instruction size in the insn decoder
    
    commit 91e5ed49fca09c2b83b262b9757d1376ee2b46c3 upstream.
    
    x86 instructions cannot exceed 15 bytes, and the instruction
    decoder should enforce that.  Prior to 6ba48ff46f76, the
    instruction length limit was implicitly set to 16, which was an
    approximation of 15, but there is currently no limit at all.
    
    Fix MAX_INSN_SIZE (it should be 15, not 16), and fix the decoder
    to reject instructions that exceed MAX_INSN_SIZE.
    
    Other than potentially confusing some of the decoder sanity
    checks, I'm not aware of any actual problems that omitting this
    check would cause, nor am I aware of any practical problems
    caused by the MAX_INSN_SIZE error.

    commit 74672d069b298b03e9f657fd70915e055739882e upstream.

    "
    I'm seeing "iostat -x -k 1" print this after a RAID1 rebuild on 4.0-rc5.
    It's not abnormal other than it's 3-disk, with one being SSD (sdc) and

    The cause is commit "18c0b223cf9901727ef3b02da6711ac930b4e5d4" uses the
    generic_start_io_acct to account the disk stats rather than the open code,
    but it also introduced the increase to .in_flight[rw] which is needless to
    md. So we re-use the open code here to fix it.

    pxa168: fix double deallocation of managed resources
    
    [ Upstream commit 0e03fd3e335d272bee88fe733d5fd13f5c5b7140 ]
    
    Commit 43d3ddf87a57 ("net: pxa168_eth: add device tree support") starts
    to use managed resources by adding devm_clk_get() and
    devm_ioremap_resource(), but it leaves explicit iounmap() and clock_put()
    in pxa168_eth_remove() and in failure handling code of pxa168_eth_probe().
    As a result double free can happen.
    
    The patch removes explicit resource deallocation. Also it converts
    clk_disable() to clk_disable_unprepare() to make it symmetrical with
    clk_prepare_enable().

    net: fix crash in build_skb()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ea2f62c8bda242433809c7f4e9eae1c52c40bbe ]
    
    When I added pfmemalloc support in build_skb(), I forgot netlink
    was using build_skb() with a vmalloc() area.
    
    In this patch I introduce __build_skb() for netlink use,
    and build_skb() is a wrapper handling both skb->head_frag and
    skb->pfmemalloc
    
    This means netlink no longer has to hack skb->head_frag

    net: do not deplete pfmemalloc reserve
    
    [ Upstream commit 79930f5892e134c6da1254389577fffb8bd72c66 ]
    
    build_skb() should look at the page pfmemalloc status.
    If set, this means page allocator allocated this page in the
    expectation it would help to free other pages. Networking
    stack can do that only if skb->pfmemalloc is also set.
    
    Also, we must refrain using high order pages from the pfmemalloc
    reserve, so __page_frag_refill() must also use __GFP_NOMEMALLOC for
    them. Under memory pressure, using order-0 pages is probably the best
    strategy.

    tcp: avoid looping in tcp_send_fin()
    
    [ Upstream commit 845704a535e9b3c76448f52af1b70e4422ea03fd ]
    
    Presence of an unbound loop in tcp_send_fin() had always been hard
    to explain when analyzing crash dumps involving gigantic dying processes
    with millions of sockets.
    
    Lets try a different strategy :
    
    In case of memory pressure, try to add the FIN flag to last packet
    in write queue, even if packet was already sent. TCP stack will
    be able to deliver this FIN after a timeout event. Note that this
    FIN being delivered by a retransmit, it also carries a Push flag
    given our current implementation.
    
    By checking sk_under_memory_pressure(), we anticipate that cooking
    many FIN packets might deplete tcp memory.
    
    In the case we could not allocate a packet, even with __GFP_WAIT
    allocation, then not sending a FIN seems quite reasonable if it allows
    to get rid of this socket, free memory, and not block the process from
    eventually doing other useful work.

    tcp: fix possible deadlock in tcp_send_fin()
    
    [ Upstream commit d83769a580f1132ac26439f50068a29b02be535e ]
    
    Using sk_stream_alloc_skb() in tcp_send_fin() is dangerous in
    case a huge process is killed by OOM, and tcp_mem[2] is hit.
    
    To be able to free memory we need to make progress, so this
    patch allows FIN packets to not care about tcp_mem[2], if
    skb allocation succeeded.
    
    In a follow-up patch, we might abort tcp_send_fin() infinite loop
    in case TIF_MEMDIE is set on this thread, as memory allocator
    did its best getting extra memory already.

    ppp: call skb_checksum_complete_unset in ppp_receive_frame
    
    [ Upstream commit 3dfb05340ec6676e6fc71a9ae87bbbe66d3c2998 ]
    
    Call checksum_complete_unset in PPP receive to discard checksum-complete
    value. PPP does not pull checksum for headers and also modifies packet
    as in VJ compression.

    net: add skb_checksum_complete_unset
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e18b9adf2f910ec4d30b811a74a5b626e6c6125 ]
    
    This function changes ip_summed to CHECKSUM_NONE if CHECKSUM_COMPLETE
    is set. This is called to discard checksum-complete when packet
    is being modified and checksum is not pulled for headers in a layer.

    ip_forward: Drop frames with attached skb->sk
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ab957492d13bb819400ac29ae55911d50a82a13 ]
    
    Initial discussion was:
    [FYI] xfrm: Don't lookup sk_policy for timewait sockets
    
    Forwarded frames should not have a socket attached. Especially
    tw sockets will lead to panics later-on in the stack.
    
    This was observed with TPROXY assigning a tw socket and broken
    policy routing (misconfigured). As a result frame enters
    forwarding path instead of input. We cannot solve this in
    TPROXY as it cannot know that policy routing is broken.
    
    v2:
    Remove useless comment
