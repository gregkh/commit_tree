    mfd: adp5520: Restore mode bits on resume
    
    commit c6cc25fda58da8685ecef3f179adc7b99c8253b2 upstream.
    
    The adp5520 unfortunately also clears the BL_EN bit when the nSTNDBY bit is
    cleared. So we need to make sure to restore it during resume if it was set
    before suspend.

    mmc: atmel-mci: pio hang on block errors
    
    commit bdbc5d0c60f3e9de3eeccf1c1a18bdc11dca62cc upstream.
    
    The driver is doing, by default, multi-block reads. When a block error
    occurs, card/block.c instigates a single block read: "mmcblk0: retrying
    using single block read".  It leaves the sg chain intact and just changes
    the length attribute for the first sg entry and the overall sg_len
    parameter.  When atmci_read_data_pio is called to read the single block
    of data it ignores the sg_len and expects to read more than 512 bytes as
    it sees there are multiple items in the sg list. No more data comes as
    the controller has only been commanded to get one block.

    mmc: core: Fix bit width test failing on old eMMC cards
    
    commit 836dc2fe89c968c10cada87e0dfae6626f8f9da3 upstream.
    
    PARTITION_SUPPORT needs to be set before doing the compare on version
    number so the bit width test does not get invalid data.  Before this
    patch, a Sandisk iNAND eMMC card would detect 1-bit width although
    the hardware supports 4-bit.
    
    Only affects old emmc devices - pre 4.4 devices.

    commit f7b0e1055574ce06ab53391263b4e205bf38daf3 upstream.
    
    With the current implementation, kstat_cpu(cpu).irqs_sum is also
    increased in case of irq_mis_count increment.
    
    So there is no need to count irq_mis_count in arch_irq_stat,
    otherwise irq_mis_count will be counted twice in the sum of
    /proc/stat.

    commit 91cf54feecf815bec0b6a8d6d9dbd0e219f2f2cc upstream.
    
    Fix regression introduced by commit 796211b7953 ("mmc: atmel-mci: add
    pdc support and runtime capabilities detection") which removed the need
    for CONFIG_MMC_ATMELMCI_DMA but kept the Kconfig-entry as well as the
    compile guards around dma_release_channel() in remove(). Consequently,
    DMA is always enabled (if supported), but the DMA-channel is not
    released on module unload unless the DMA-config option is selected.
    
    Remove the no longer used CONFIG_MMC_ATMELMCI_DMA option completely.

    ext4/jbd2: don't wait (forever) for stale tid caused by wraparound
    
    commit d76a3a77113db020d9bb1e894822869410450bd9 upstream.
    
    In the case where an inode has a very stale transaction id (tid) in
    i_datasync_tid or i_sync_tid, it's possible that after a very large
    (2**31) number of transactions, that the tid number space might wrap,
    causing tid_geq()'s calculations to fail.
    
    Commit deeeaf13 "jbd2: fix fsync() tid wraparound bug", later modified
    by commit e7b04ac0 "jbd2: don't wake kjournald unnecessarily",
    attempted to fix this problem, but it only avoided kjournald spinning
    forever by fixing the logic in jbd2_log_start_commit().
    
    Unfortunately, in the codepaths in fs/ext4/fsync.c and fs/ext4/inode.c
    that might call jbd2_log_start_commit() with a stale tid, those
    functions will subsequently call jbd2_log_wait_commit() with the same
    stale tid, and then wait for a very long time.  To fix this, we
    replace the calls to jbd2_log_start_commit() and
    jbd2_log_wait_commit() with a call to a new function,
    jbd2_complete_transaction(), which will correctly handle stale tid's.
    
    As a bonus, jbd2_complete_transaction() will avoid locking
    j_state_lock for writing unless a commit needs to be started.  This
    should have a small (but probably not measurable) improvement for
    ext4's scalability.

    ixgbe: fix EICR write in ixgbe_msix_other
    
    commit d87d830720a1446403ed38bfc2da268be0d356d1 upstream.
    
    Previously, the ixgbe_msix_other was writing the full 32bits of the set
    interrupts, instead of only the ones which the ixgbe_msix_other is
    handling. This resulted in a loss of performance when the X540's PPS feature is
    enabled due to sometimes clearing queue interrupts which resulted in the driver
    not getting the interrupt for cleaning the q_vector rings often enough. The fix
    is to simply mask the lower 16bits off so that this handler does not write them
    in the EICR, which causes them to remain high and be properly handled by the
    clean_rings interrupt routine as normal.

    would prevent us from using anything more than 8TiB.  By setting
    kernel.shmall greater than 8EiB-8TiB would make the job work.

    wireless: regulatory: fix channel disabling race condition
    
    commit 990de49f74e772b6db5208457b7aa712a5f4db86 upstream.
    
    When a full scan 2.4 and 5 GHz scan is scheduled, but then the 2.4 GHz
    part of the scan disables a 5.2 GHz channel due to, e.g. receiving
    country or frequency information, that 5.2 GHz channel might already
    be in the list of channels to scan next. Then, when the driver checks
    if it should do a passive scan, that will return false and attempt an
    active scan. This is not only wrong but can also lead to the iwlwifi
    device firmware crashing since it checks regulatory as well.
    
    Fix this by not setting the channel flags to just disabled but rather
    OR'ing in the disabled flag. That way, even if the race happens, the
    channel will be scanned passively which is still (mostly) correct.

    nfsd: Decode and send 64bit time values
    
    commit bf8d909705e9d9bac31d9b8eac6734d2b51332a7 upstream.
    
    The seconds field of an nfstime4 structure is 64bit, but we are assuming
    that the first 32bits are zero-filled.  So if the client tries to set
    atime to a value before the epoch (touch -t 196001010101), then the
    server will save the wrong value on disk.

    Don't actually close any opens until we don't need them at all.
    
    This means being left with write access when it's not really necessary,

    md: bad block list should default to disabled.
    
    commit 486adf72ccc0c235754923d47a2270c5dcb0c98b upstream.
    
    Maintenance of a bad-block-list currently defaults to 'enabled'
    and is then disabled when it cannot be supported.
    This is backwards and causes problem for dm-raid which didn't know
    to disable it.
    
    So fix the defaults, and only enabled for v1.x metadata which
    explicitly has bad blocks enabled.
    
    The problem with dm-raid has been present since badblock support was
    added in v3.1, so this patch is suitable for any -stable from 3.1
    onwards.

    LOCKD: Ensure that nlmclnt_block resets block->b_status after a server reboot
    
    commit 1dfd89af8697a299e7982ae740d4695ecd917eef upstream.
    
    After a server reboot, the reclaimer thread will recover all the existing
    locks. For locks that are blocked, however, it will change the value
    of block->b_status to nlm_lck_denied_grace_period in order to signal that
    they need to wake up and resend the original blocking lock request.
    
    Due to a bug, however, the block->b_status never gets reset after the
    blocked locks have been woken up, and so the process goes into an
    infinite loop of resends until the blocked lock is satisfied.

    exec: do not abuse ->cred_guard_mutex in threadgroup_lock()
    
    commit e56fb2874015370e3b7f8d85051f6dce26051df9 upstream.
    
    threadgroup_lock() takes signal->cred_guard_mutex to ensure that
    thread_group_leader() is stable.  This doesn't look nice, the scope of
    this lock in do_execve() is huge.
    
    And as Dave pointed out this can lead to deadlock, we have the
    following dependencies:
    
            do_execve:              cred_guard_mutex -> i_mutex
            cgroup_mount:           i_mutex -> cgroup_mutex
            attach_task_by_pid:     cgroup_mutex -> cred_guard_mutex
    
    Change de_thread() to take threadgroup_change_begin() around the
    switch-the-leader code and change threadgroup_lock() to avoid
    ->cred_guard_mutex.
    
    Note that de_thread() can't sleep with ->group_rwsem held, this can
    obviously deadlock with the exiting leader if the writer is active, so it
    does threadgroup_change_end() before schedule().

    fs/dcache.c: add cond_resched() to shrink_dcache_parent()
    
    commit 421348f1ca0bf17769dee0aed4d991845ae0536d upstream.
    
    Call cond_resched() in shrink_dcache_parent() to maintain interactivity.
    
    Before this patch:
    
            void shrink_dcache_parent(struct dentry * parent)
            {
                    while ((found = select_parent(parent, &dispose)) != 0)
                            shrink_dentry_list(&dispose);
            }
    
    select_parent() populates the dispose list with dentries which
    shrink_dentry_list() then deletes.  select_parent() carefully uses
    need_resched() to avoid doing too much work at once.  But neither
    shrink_dcache_parent() nor its called functions call cond_resched().  So
    once need_resched() is set select_parent() will return single dentry
    dispose list which is then deleted by shrink_dentry_list().  This is
    inefficient when there are a lot of dentry to process.  This can cause
    softlockup and hurts interactivity on non preemptable kernels.
    
    This change adds cond_resched() in shrink_dcache_parent().  The benefit
    of this is that need_resched() is quickly cleared so that future calls
    to select_parent() are able to efficiently return a big batch of dentry.
    
    These additional cond_resched() do not seem to impact performance, at
    least for the workload below.
    
    Here is a program which can cause soft lockup if other system activity
    sets need_resched().
    
            int main()
            {
                    struct rlimit rlim;
                    int i;

                    if (setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, &rlim))

                            snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "x/%d", i);
                            f[i] = open(buf, O_CREAT);

                    }
    
                    /* close some of the files */
                    for (i = 0; i < 85000; i++)
                            close(f[i]);

    inotify: invalid mask should return a error number but not set it
    
    commit 04df32fa10ab9a6f0643db2949d42efc966bc844 upstream.
    
    When we run the crackerjack testsuite, the inotify_add_watch test is
    stalled.
    
    This is caused by the invalid mask 0 - the task is waiting for the event
    but it never comes.  inotify_add_watch() should return -EINVAL as it did
    before commit 676a0675cf92 ("inotify: remove broken mask checks causing
    unmount to be EINVAL").  That commit removes the invalid mask check, but
    that check is needed.
    
    Check the mask's ALL_INOTIFY_BITS before the inotify_arg_to_mask() call.
    If none are set, just return -EINVAL.
    
    Because IN_UNMOUNT is in ALL_INOTIFY_BITS, this change will not trigger
    the problem that above commit fixed.

    clockevents: Set dummy handler on CPU_DEAD shutdown
    
    commit 6f7a05d7018de222e40ca003721037a530979974 upstream.
    
    Vitaliy reported that a per cpu HPET timer interrupt crashes the
    system during hibernation. What happens is that the per cpu HPET timer
    gets shut down when the nonboot cpus are stopped. When the nonboot
    cpus are onlined again the HPET code sets up the MSI interrupt which
    fires before the clock event device is registered. The event handler
    is still set to hrtimer_interrupt, which then crashes the machine due
    to highres mode not being active.
    
    See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=700333
    
    There is no real good way to avoid that in the HPET code. The HPET
    code alrady has a mechanism to detect spurious interrupts when event
    handler == NULL for a similar reason.
    
    We can handle that in the clockevent/tick layer and replace the
    previous functional handler with a dummy handler like we do in
    tick_setup_new_device().
    
    The original clockevents code did this in clockevents_exchange_device(),
    but that got removed by commit 7c1e76897 (clockevents: prevent
    clockevent event_handler ending up handler_noop) which forgot to fix
    it up in tick_shutdown(). Same issue with the broadcast device.

    cgroup: fix broken file xattrs
    
    commit 712317ad97f41e738e1a19aa0a6392a78a84094e upstream.
    
    We should store file xattrs in struct cfent instead of struct cftype,
    because cftype is a type while cfent is object instance of cftype.
    
    For example each cgroup has a tasks file, and each tasks file is
    associated with a uniq cfent, but all those files share the same
    struct cftype.
    
    Alexey Kodanev reported a crash, which can be reproduced:
    
      # mount -t cgroup -o xattr /sys/fs/cgroup
      # mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/test
      # setfattr -n trusted.value -v test_value /sys/fs/cgroup/tasks
      # rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/test
      # umount /sys/fs/cgroup
      oops!
    
    In this case, simple_xattrs_free() will free the same struct simple_xattrs
    twice.

    cgroup: fix an off-by-one bug which may trigger BUG_ON()
    
    commit 3ac1707a13a3da9cfc8f242a15b2fae6df2c5f88 upstream.
    
    The 3rd parameter of flex_array_prealloc() is the number of elements,
    not the index of the last element.
    
    The effect of the bug is, when opening cgroup.procs, a flex array will
    be allocated and all elements of the array is allocated with

    ACPI / thermal: do not always return THERMAL_TREND_RAISING for active trip points
    
    commit 94a409319561ec1847fd9bf996a2d5843ad00932 upstream.
    
    Commit 4ae46be "Thermal: Introduce thermal_zone_trip_update()"
    introduced a regression causing the fan to be always on even when
    the system is idle.
    
    My original idea in that commit is that:
     - when the current temperature is above the trip point,
       keep the fan on, even if the temperature is dropping.
     - when the current temperature is below the trip point,
       turn on the fan when the temperature is raising,
       turn off the fan when the temperature is dropping.
    
    But this is what the code actually does:
     - when the current temperature is above the trip point,
       the fan keeps on.
     - when the current temperature is below the trip point,
       the fan is always on because thermal_get_trend()
       in driver/acpi/thermal.c returns THERMAL_TREND_RAISING.
    Thus the fan keeps running even if the system is idle.
    
    Fix this in drivers/acpi/thermal.c.

    ACPI: Fix wrong parameter passed to memblock_reserve
    
    commit a6432ded299726f123b93d0132fead200551535c upstream.
    
    Commit 53aac44 (ACPI: Store valid ACPI tables passed via early initrd
    in reserved memblock areas) introduced acpi_initrd_override() that
    passes a wrong value as the second argument to memblock_reserve().
    
    Namely, the second argument of memblock_reserve() is the size of the
    region, not the address of the top of it, so make
    acpi_initrd_override() pass the size in there as appropriate.

    libata: acpi: make ata_ap_acpi_handle not block
    
    commit d66af4df0837f21bf267305dc5ccab2d29e24d86 upstream.
    
    Since commit 30dcf76acc, ata_ap_acpi_handle will always do a namespace
    walk, which requires acquiring an acpi namespace mutex. This made it
    impossible to be used when calling path has held a spinlock.
    
    For example, it can occur in the following code path for pata_acpi:
    ata_scsi_queuecmd (ap->lock is acquired)
      __ata_scsi_queuecmd
        ata_scsi_translate
          ata_qc_issue
            pacpi_qc_issue
              ata_acpi_stm
                ata_ap_acpi_handle
                  acpi_get_child
                    acpi_walk_namespace
                      acpi_ut_acquire_mutex (acquire mutex while holding lock)
    This caused scheduling while atomic bug, as reported in bug #56781.
    
    Actually, ata_ap_acpi_handle doesn't have to walk the namespace every
    time it is called, it can simply return the bound acpi handle on the
    corresponding SCSI host. The reason previously it is not done this way
    is, ata_ap_acpi_handle is used in the binding function
    ata_acpi_bind_host by ata_acpi_gtm when the handle is not bound to the
    SCSI host yet. Since we already have the ATA port's handle in its
    binding function, we can simply use it instead of calling
    ata_ap_acpi_handle there. So introduce a new function __ata_acpi_gtm,
    where it will receive an acpi handle param in addition to the ATA port
    which is solely used for debug statement. With this change, we can make
    ata_ap_acpi_handle simply return the bound handle for SCSI host instead
    of walking the acpi namespace now.

    drivers/rtc/rtc-cmos.c: don't disable hpet emulation on suspend
    
    commit e005715efaf674660ae59af83b13822567e3a758 upstream.
    
    There's a bug where rtc alarms are ignored after the rtc cmos suspends
    but before the system finishes suspend.  Since hpet emulation is
    disabled and it still handles the interrupts, a wake event is never
    registered which is done from the rtc layer.
    
    This patch reverts commit d1b2efa83fbf ("rtc: disable hpet emulation on
    suspend") which disabled hpet emulation.  To fix the problem mentioned
    in that commit, hpet_rtc_timer_init() is called directly on resume.

    mm: swap: mark swap pages writeback before queueing for direct IO
    
    commit 0cdc444a67ccdbd58bfbcba865cb17a9f17a7691 upstream.
    
    As pointed out by Andrew Morton, the swap-over-NFS writeback is not
    setting PageWriteback before it is queued for direct IO.  While swap
    pages do not participate in BDI or process dirty accounting and the IO
    is synchronous, the writeback bit is still required and not setting it
    in this case was an oversight.  swapoff depends on the page writeback to
    synchronoise all pending writes on a swap page before it is reused.
    Swapcache freeing and reuse depend on checking the PageWriteback under
    lock to ensure the page is safe to reuse.
    
    Direct IO handlers and the direct IO handler for NFS do not deal with
    PageWriteback as they are synchronous writes.  In the case of NFS, it
    schedules pages (or a page in the case of swap) for IO and then waits
    synchronously for IO to complete in nfs_direct_write().  It is
    recognised that this is a slowdown from normal swap handling which is
    asynchronous and uses a completion handler.  Shoving PageWriteback
    handling down into direct IO handlers looks like a bad fit to handle the
    swap case although it may have to be dealt with some day if swap is
    converted to use direct IO in general and bmap is finally done away
    with.  At that point it will be necessary to refit asynchronous direct
    IO with completion handlers onto the swap subsystem.
    
    As swapcache currently depends on PageWriteback to protect against
    races, this patch sets PageWriteback under the page lock before queueing
    it for direct IO.  It is cleared when the direct IO handler returns.  IO
    errors are treated similarly to the direct-to-bio case except PageError
    is not set as in the case of swap-over-NFS, it is likely to be a
    transient error.
    
    It was asked what prevents such a page being reclaimed in parallel.
    With this patch applied, such a page will now be skipped (most of the
    time) or blocked until the writeback completes.  Reclaim checks
    PageWriteback under the page lock before calling try_to_free_swap and
    the page lock should prevent the page being requeued for IO before it is
    freed.
    
    This and Jerome's related patch should considered for -stable as far
    back as 3.6 when swap-over-NFS was introduced.

    swap: redirty page if page write fails on swap file
    
    commit 2d30d31ea3c5be426ce25607b9bd1835acb85e0a upstream.
    
    Since commit 62c230bc1790 ("mm: add support for a filesystem to activate
    swap files and use direct_IO for writing swap pages"), swap_writepage()
    calls direct_IO on swap files.  However, in that case the page isn't
    redirtied if I/O fails, and is therefore handled afterwards as if it has
    been successfully written to the swap file, leading to memory corruption
    when the page is eventually swapped back in.
    
    This patch sets the page dirty when direct_IO() fails.  It fixes a
    memory corruption that happened while using swap-over-NFS.

    When we change the system time to a low value like this, the value of
    timekeeper->offs_real will be a negative value.
    
    It seems that the WARN occurs because an hrtimer has been started in the time
    between the releasing of the timekeeper lock and the IPI call (via a call to
    on_each_cpu) in clock_was_set() in the do_settimeofday() code.  The end result
    is that a REALTIME_CLOCK timer has been added with softexpires = expires =
    KTIME_MAX.  The hrtimer_interrupt() fires/is called and the loop at
    kernel/hrtimer.c:1289 is executed.  In this loop the code subtracts the
    clock base's offset (which was set to timekeeper->offs_real in
    do_settimeofday()) from the current hrtimer_cpu_base->expiry value (which
    was KTIME_MAX):
    
            KTIME_MAX - (a negative value) = overflow
    
    A simple check for an overflow can resolve this problem.  Using KTIME_MAX
    instead of the overflow value will result in the hrtimer function being run,
    and the reprogramming of the timer after that.

    hrtimer: Fix ktime_add_ns() overflow on 32bit architectures
    
    commit 51fd36f3fad8447c487137ae26b9d0b3ce77bb25 upstream.
    
    One can trigger an overflow when using ktime_add_ns() on a 32bit
    architecture not supporting CONFIG_KTIME_SCALAR.
    
    When passing a very high value for u64 nsec, e.g. 7881299347898368000
    the do_div() function converts this value to seconds (7881299347) which
    is still to high to pass to the ktime_set() function as long. The result
    in is a negative value.
    
    The problem on my system occurs in the tick-sched.c,
    tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick() when time_delta is set to
    timekeeping_max_deferment(). The check for time_delta < KTIME_MAX is
    valid, thus ktime_add_ns() is called with a too large value resulting in
    a negative expire value. This leads to an endless loop in the ticker code:
    
    time_delta: 7881299347898368000
    expires = ktime_add_ns(last_update, time_delta)
    expires: negative value
    
    This fix caps the value to KTIME_MAX.
    
    This error doesn't occurs on 64bit or architectures supporting
    CONFIG_KTIME_SCALAR (e.g. ARM, x86-32).

    The recent changes in the USB API ("implement new semantics for

    This is not the behaviour wanted by any of the audio drivers because

    Therefore, our URBs need to be submitted without this flag.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix autopm error during probing
    
    commit 60af3d037eb8c670dcce31401501d1271e7c5d95 upstream.
    
    We've got strange errors in get_ctl_value() in mixer.c during
    probing, e.g. on Hercules RMX2 DJ Controller:
    
      ALSA mixer.c:352 cannot get ctl value: req = 0x83, wValue = 0x201, wIndex = 0xa00, type = 4
      ALSA mixer.c:352 cannot get ctl value: req = 0x83, wValue = 0x200, wIndex = 0xa00, type = 4
      ....
    
    It turned out that the culprit is autopm: snd_usb_autoresume() returns
    -ENODEV when called during card->probing = 1.
    
    Since the call itself during card->probing = 1 is valid, let's fix the

    ALSA: usb-audio: disable autopm for MIDI devices
    
    commit cbc200bca4b51a8e2406d4b654d978f8503d430b upstream.
    
    Commit 88a8516a2128 (ALSA: usbaudio: implement USB autosuspend)
    introduced autopm for all USB audio/MIDI devices.  However, many MIDI
    devices, such as synthesizers, do not merely transmit MIDI messages but
    use their MIDI inputs to control other functions.  With autopm, these
    devices would get powered down as soon as the last MIDI port device is
    closed on the host.
    
    Even some plain MIDI interfaces could get broken: they automatically
    send Active Sensing messages while powered up, but as soon as these
    messages cease, the receiving device would interpret this as an
    accidental disconnection.
    
    Commit f5f165418cab (ALSA: usb-audio: Fix missing autopm for MIDI input)
    introduced another regression: some devices (e.g. the Roland GAIA SH-01)
    are self-powered but do a reset whenever the USB interface's power state
    changes.
    
    To work around all this, just disable autopm for all USB MIDI devices.

    ALSA: usb: Add quirk for 192KHz recording on E-Mu devices
    
    commit 1539d4f82ad534431cc67935e8e442ccf107d17d upstream.
    
    When recording at 176.2KHz or 192Khz, the device adds a 32-bit length
    header to the capture packets, which obviously needs to be ignored for
    recording to work properly.
    
    Userspace expected:  L0 L1 L2 R0 R1 R2
    ...but actually got: R2 L0 L1 L2 R0 R1
    
    Also, the last byte of the length header being interpreted as L0 of
    the first sample caused spikes every 0.5ms, resulting in a loud 16KHz
    tone (about the highest 'B' on a piano) being present throughout
    captures.
    
    Tested at all sample rates on an E-Mu 0404USB, and tested for
    regressions on a generic USB headset.

    ALSA: snd-usb: try harder to find USB_DT_CS_ENDPOINT
    
    commit ebfc594c02148b6a85c2f178cf167a44a3c3ce10 upstream.
    
    The USB_DT_CS_ENDPOINT class-specific endpoint descriptor is usually
    stuffed directly after the standard USB endpoint descriptor, and this is
    where the driver currently expects it to be.
    
    There are, however, devices in the wild that have it the other way
    around in their descriptor sets, so the USB_DT_CS_ENDPOINT comes
    *before* the standard enpoint. Devices known to implement it that way
    are "Sennheiser BTD-500" and Plantronics USB headsets.
    
    When the driver can't find the USB_DT_CS_ENDPOINT, it won't be able to
    change sample rates, as the bitmask for the validity of this command is
    storen in bmAttributes of that descriptor.
    
    Fix this by searching the entire interface instead of just the extra
    bytes of the first endpoint, in case the latter fails.

    TPM: Retry SaveState command in suspend path
    
    commit 32d33b29ba077d6b45de35f2181e0a7411b162f4 upstream.
    
    If the TPM has already been sent a SaveState command before the driver
    is loaded it may have problems sending that same command again later.
    
    This issue is seen with the Chromebook Pixel due to a firmware bug in
    the legacy mode boot path which is sending the SaveState command
    before booting the kernel.  More information is available at
    http://crbug.com/203524
    
    This change introduces a retry of the SaveState command in the suspend
    path in order to work around this issue.  A future firmware update
    should fix this but this is also a trivial workaround in the driver
    that has no effect on systems that do not show this problem.
    
    When this does happen the TPM responds with a non-fatal TPM_RETRY code
    that is defined in the specification:
    
      The TPM is too busy to respond to the command immediately, but the
      command could be resubmitted at a later time.  The TPM MAY return
      TPM_RETRY for any command at any time.
    
    It can take several seconds before the TPM will respond again.  I
    measured a typical time between 3 and 4 seconds and the timeout is set
    at a safe 5 seconds.
    
    It is also possible to reproduce this with commands via /dev/tpm0.
    The bug linked above has a python script attached which can be used to
    test for this problem.  I tested a variety of TPMs from Infineon,
    Nuvoton, Atmel, and STMicro but was only able to reproduce this with
    LPC and I2C TPMs from Infineon.
    
    The TPM specification only loosely defines this behavior:
    
      TPM Main Level 2 Part 3 v1.2 r116, section 3.3. TPM_SaveState:
      The TPM MAY declare all preserved values invalid in response to any
      command other than TPM_Init.
    
      TCG PC Client BIOS Spec 1.21 section 8.3.1.
      After issuing a TPM_SaveState command, the OS SHOULD NOT issue TPM
      commands before transitioning to S3 without issuing another
      TPM_SaveState command.
    
      TCG PC Client TIS 1.21, section 4. Power Management:
      The TPM_SaveState command allows a Static OS to indicate to the TPM
      that the platform may enter a low power state where the TPM will be
      required to enter into the D3 power state.  The use of the term "may"
      is significant in that there is no requirement for the platform to
      actually enter the low power state after sending the TPM_SaveState
      command.  The software may, in fact, send subsequent commands after
      sending the TPM_SaveState command.

    mm: allow arch code to control the user page table ceiling
    
    commit 6ee8630e02be6dd89926ca0fbc21af68b23dc087 upstream.
    
    On architectures where a pgd entry may be shared between user and kernel
    (e.g.  ARM+LPAE), freeing page tables needs a ceiling other than 0.
    This patch introduces a generic USER_PGTABLES_CEILING that arch code can
    override.  It is the responsibility of the arch code setting the ceiling
    to ensure the complete freeing of the page tables (usually in
    pgd_free()).

    There is a kernel memory leak observed when the proc file
    /proc/fs/fscache/stats is read.
    
    The reason is that in fscache_stats_open, single_open is called and the
    respective release function is not called during release.  Hence fix
    with correct release function - single_release().

    Wrong asm register contraints in the kvm implementation
    
    commit de53e9caa4c6149ef4a78c2f83d7f5b655848767 upstream.
    
    The Linux Kernel contains some inline assembly source code which has
    wrong asm register constraints in arch/ia64/kvm/vtlb.c.
    
    I observed this on Kernel 3.2.35 but it is also true on the most
    recent Kernel 3.9-rc1.
    
    File arch/ia64/kvm/vtlb.c:

    {
            u64 ret;

                    thash_vhpt_insert(current_vcpu, data->page_flags,
                            data->itir, iha, D_TLB);
    
            asm volatile (
                            "rsm psr.ic|psr.i;;"
                            "srlz.d;;"

                            "ssm psr.i;;"
                            "srlz.d;;"
                            : "=r"(ret) : "r"(iha), "r"(pte):"memory");
    
            return ret;
    }
    
    The list of output registers is
                            : "=r"(ret) : "r"(iha), "r"(pte):"memory");
    The constraint "=r" means that the GCC has to maintain that these vars
    are in registers and contain valid info when the program flow leaves
    the assembly block (output registers).
    But "=r" also means that GCC can put them in registers that are used
    as input registers. Input registers are iha, pte on the example.
    If the predicate p7 is true, the 8th assembly instruction
                            "(p7) mov %0=r0;"
    is the first one which writes to a register which is maintained by the
    register constraints; it sets %0. %0 means the first register operand;
    it is ret here.
    This instruction might overwrite the %2 register (pte) which is needed
    by the next instruction:
                            "(p7) st8 [%2]=r9;;"
    Whether it really happens depends on how GCC decides what registers it
    uses and how it optimizes the code.
    
    The attached patch  fixes the register operand constraints in
    arch/ia64/kvm/vtlb.c.
    The register constraints should be
                            : "=&r"(ret) : "r"(iha), "r"(pte):"memory");
    The & means that GCC must not use any of the input registers to place
    this output register in.
    
    This is Debian bug#702639
    (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=702639).
    
    The patch is applicable on Kernel 3.9-rc1, 3.2.35 and many other versions.

    Wrong asm register contraints in the futex implementation
    
    commit 136f39ddc53db3bcee2befbe323a56d4fbf06da8 upstream.
    
    The Linux Kernel contains some inline assembly source code which has
    wrong asm register constraints in arch/ia64/include/asm/futex.h.

    }
    
    The list of output registers is
                            : "=r" (r8), "=r" (prev)
    The constraint "=r" means that the GCC has to maintain that these vars
    are in registers and contain valid info when the program flow leaves
    the assembly block (output registers).
    But "=r" also means that GCC can put them in registers that are used
    as input registers. Input registers are uaddr, newval, oldval on the
    example.
    The second assembly instruction
                            "       mov %0=r0                               \n"
    is the first one which writes to a register; it sets %0 to 0. %0 means
    the first register operand; it is r8 here. (The r0 is read-only and
    always 0 on the Itanium; it can be used if an immediate zero value is
    needed.)
    This instruction might overwrite one of the other registers which are
    still needed.
    Whether it really happens depends on how GCC decides what registers it
    uses and how it optimizes the code.
    
    The objdump utility can give us disassembly.
    The futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() function is inline, so we have to
    look for a module that uses the funtion. This is the
    cmpxchg_futex_value_locked() function in
    kernel/futex.c:
    
    static int cmpxchg_futex_value_locked(u32 *curval, u32 __user *uaddr,
                                          u32 uval, u32 newval)
    {
            int ret;
    
            pagefault_disable();
            ret = futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic(curval, uaddr, uval, newval);
            pagefault_enable();
    
            return ret;
    }
    
    Now the disassembly. At first from the Kernel package 3.2.23 which has
    been compiled with GCC 4.4, remeber this Kernel seemed to work:

    sets the r8 register to 0 and after that

    prepares the 'oldvalue' for the cmpxchg but it takes it from r8. This
    is wrong.
    What happened here is what I explained above: An input register is
    overwritten which is still needed.
    The register operand constraints in futex.h are wrong.
    
    (The problem doesn't occur when the Kernel is compiled with GCC 4.6.)
    
    The attached patch fixes the register operand constraints in futex.h.
    The code after patching of it:
    
    static inline int
    futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic(u32 *uval, u32 __user *uaddr,
                                  u32 oldval, u32 newval)
    {
            if (!access_ok(VERIFY_WRITE, uaddr, sizeof(u32)))
                    return -EFAULT;
    
            {
                    register unsigned long r8 __asm ("r8") = 0;
                    unsigned long prev;
                    __asm__ __volatile__(
                            "       mf;;                                    \n"
                            "       mov ar.ccv=%4;;                         \n"
                            "[1:]   cmpxchg4.acq %1=[%2],%3,ar.ccv          \n"
                            "       .xdata4 \"__ex_table\", 1b-., 2f-.      \n"
                            "[2:]"
                            : "+r" (r8), "=&r" (prev)
                            : "r" (uaddr), "r" (newval),
                              "rO" ((long) (unsigned) oldval)
                            : "memory");
                    *uval = prev;
                    return r8;
            }
    }
    
    I also initialized the 'r8' var with the C programming language.
    The _asm qualifier on the definition of the 'r8' var forces GCC to use
    the r8 processor register for it.
    I don't believe that we should use inline assembly for zeroing out a
    local variable.
    The constraint is
    "+r" (r8)
    what means that it is both an input register and an output register.
    Note that the page fault handler will modify the r8 register which
    will be the return value of the function.
    The real fix is
    "=&r" (prev)
    The & means that GCC must not use any of the input registers to place
    this output register in.
    
    Patched the Kernel 3.2.23 and compiled it with GCC4.4:

    rt2x00: Fix transmit power troubles on some Ralink RT30xx cards
    
    commit 7e9dafd873034dd64ababcb858be424c4780ae13 upstream.
    
    Some cards on Ralink RT30xx chipset not have correctly TX_MIXER_GAIN
    value in them EEPROM/EFUSE. In this case, we must use default value,
    but always used EEPROM/EFUSE value. As result we have tranmitt power
    range from -10dBm to +6dBm instead 0dBm to +16dBm.

    PCI/PM: Fix fallback to PCI_D0 in pci_platform_power_transition()
    
    commit 769ba7212f2059ca9fe0c73371e3d415c8c1c529 upstream.
    
    Commit b51306c (PCI: Set device power state to PCI_D0 for device
    without native PM support) modified pci_platform_power_transition()
    by adding code causing dev->current_state for devices that don't
    support native PCI PM but are power-manageable by the platform to be
    changed to PCI_D0 regardless of the value returned by the preceding
    platform_pci_set_power_state().  In particular, that also is done
    if the platform_pci_set_power_state() has been successful, which
    causes the correct power state of the device set by
    pci_update_current_state() in that case to be overwritten by PCI_D0.
    
    Fix that mistake by making the fallback to PCI_D0 only happen if
    the platform_pci_set_power_state() has returned an error.

    PCI / ACPI: Don't query OSC support with all possible controls
    
    commit 545d6e189a41c94c11f55045a771118eccc9d9eb upstream.
    
    Found problem on system that firmware that could handle pci aer.
    Firmware get error reporting after pci injecting error, before os boots.
    But after os boots, firmware can not get report anymore, even pci=noaer
    is passed.
    
    Root cause: BIOS _OSC has problem with query bit checking.
    It turns out that BIOS vendor is copying example code from ACPI Spec.
    In ACPI Spec 5.0, page 290:
    
            If (Not(And(CDW1,1))) // Query flag clear?
            {       // Disable GPEs for features granted native control.
                    If (And(CTRL,0x01)) // Hot plug control granted?
                    {
                            Store(0,HPCE) // clear the hot plug SCI enable bit
                            Store(1,HPCS) // clear the hot plug SCI status bit
                    }
            ...
            }
    
    When Query flag is set, And(CDW1,1) will be 1, Not(1) will return 0xfffffffe.
    So it will get into code path that should be for control set only.
    BIOS acpi code should be changed to "If (LEqual(And(CDW1,1), 0)))"
    
    Current kernel code is using _OSC query to notify firmware about support
    from OS and then use _OSC to set control bits.
    During query support, current code is using all possible controls.
    So will execute code that should be only for control set stage.
    
    That will have problem when pci=noaer or aer firmware_first is used.
    As firmware have that control set for os aer already in query support stage,
    but later will not os aer handling.
    
    We should avoid passing all possible controls, just use osc_control_set
    instead.
    That should workaround BIOS bugs with affected systems on the field
    as more bios vendors are copying sample code from ACPI spec.

    Fix initialization of CMCI/CMCP interrupts
    
    commit d303e9e98fce56cdb3c6f2ac92f626fc2bd51c77 upstream.
    
    Back 2010 during a revamp of the irq code some initializations
    were moved from ia64_mca_init() to ia64_mca_late_init() in
    
            commit c75f2aa13f5b268aba369b5dc566088b5194377c
            Cannot use register_percpu_irq() from ia64_mca_init()
    
    But this was hideously wrong. First of all these initializations
    are now down far too late. Specifically after all the other cpus
    have been brought up and initialized their own CMC vectors from
    smp_callin(). Also ia64_mca_late_init() may be called from any cpu
    so the line:
            ia64_mca_cmc_vector_setup();       /* Setup vector on BSP */
    is generally not executed on the BSP, and so the CMC vector isn't
    setup at all on that processor.
    
    Make use of the arch_early_irq_init() hook to get this code executed
    at just the right moment: not too early, not too late.

    sysfs: fix use after free in case of concurrent read/write and readdir
    
    commit f7db5e7660b122142410dcf36ba903c73d473250 upstream.
    
    The inode->i_mutex isn't hold when updating filp->f_pos
    in read()/write(), so the filp->f_pos might be read as
    0 or 1 in readdir() when there is concurrent read()/write()
    on this same file, then may cause use after free in readdir().

    i2c: xiic: must always write 16-bit words to TX_FIFO
    
    commit c39e8e4354ce4daf23336de5daa28a3b01f00aa6 upstream.
    
    The TX_FIFO register is 10 bits wide.  The lower 8 bits are the data to be
    written, while the upper two bits are flags to indicate stop/start.
    
    The driver apparently attempted to optimize write access, by only writing a
    byte in those cases where the stop/start bits are zero.  However, we have
    seen cases where the lower byte is duplicated onto the upper byte by the
    hardware, which causes inadvertent stop/starts.
    
    This patch changes the write access to the transmit FIFO to always be 16 bits
    wide.

    tracing: Remove most or all of stack tracer stack size from stack_max_size
    
    commit 4df297129f622bdc18935c856f42b9ddd18f9f28 upstream.
    
    Currently, the depth reported in the stack tracer stack_trace file
    does not match the stack_max_size file. This is because the stack_max_size
    includes the overhead of stack tracer itself while the depth does not.
    
    The first time a max is triggered, a calculation is not performed that
    figures out the overhead of the stack tracer and subtracts it from
    the stack_max_size variable. The overhead is stored and is subtracted
    from the reported stack size for comparing for a new max.
    
    Now the stack_max_size corresponds to the reported depth:
    
     # cat stack_max_size
    4640
    
     # cat stack_trace
            Depth    Size   Location    (48 entries)
            -----    ----   --------
      0)     4640      32   _raw_spin_lock+0x18/0x24
      1)     4608     112   ____cache_alloc+0xb7/0x22d

      3)     4416      16   mempool_alloc_slab+0x15/0x17
    [...]
    
    While testing against and older gcc on x86 that uses mcount instead
    of fentry, I found that pasing in ip + MCOUNT_INSN_SIZE let the
    stack trace show one more function deep which was missing before.

    tracing: Fix stack tracer with fentry use
    
    commit d4ecbfc49b4b1d4b597fb5ba9e4fa25d62f105c5 upstream.
    
    When gcc 4.6 on x86 is used, the function tracer will use the new
    option -mfentry which does a call to "fentry" at every function
    instead of "mcount". The significance of this is that fentry is
    called as the first operation of the function instead of the mcount
    usage of being called after the stack.
    
    This causes the stack tracer to show some bogus results for the size
    of the last function traced, as well as showing "ftrace_call" instead
    of the function. This is due to the stack frame not being set up
    by the function that is about to be traced.
    
     # cat stack_trace
            Depth    Size   Location    (48 entries)
            -----    ----   --------
      0)     4824     216   ftrace_call+0x5/0x2f
      1)     4608     112   ____cache_alloc+0xb7/0x22d
      2)     4496      80   kmem_cache_alloc+0x63/0x12f
    
    The 216 size for ftrace_call includes both the ftrace_call stack
    (which includes the saving of registers it does), as well as the
    stack size of the parent.
    
    To fix this, if CC_USING_FENTRY is defined, then the stack_tracer
    will reserve the first item in stack_dump_trace[] array when
    calling save_stack_trace(), and it will fill it in with the parent ip.
    Then the code will look for the parent pointer on the stack and
    give the real size of the parent's stack pointer:
    
     # cat stack_trace
            Depth    Size   Location    (14 entries)
            -----    ----   --------
      0)     2640      48   update_group_power+0x26/0x187
      1)     2592     224   update_sd_lb_stats+0x2a5/0x4ac
      2)     2368     160   find_busiest_group+0x31/0x1f1
      3)     2208     256   load_balance+0xd9/0x662
    
    I'm Cc'ing stable, although it's not urgent, as it only shows bogus
    size for item #0, the rest of the trace is legit. It should still be
    corrected in previous stable releases.

    tty: fix up atime/mtime mess, take three
    
    commit b0b885657b6c8ef63a46bc9299b2a7715d19acde upstream.
    
    We first tried to avoid updating atime/mtime entirely (commit
    b0de59b5733d: "TTY: do not update atime/mtime on read/write"), and then
    limited it to only update it occasionally (commit 37b7f3c76595: "TTY:
    fix atime/mtime regression"), but it turns out that this was both
    insufficient and overkill.
    
    It was insufficient because we let people attach to the shared ptmx node
    to see activity without even reading atime/mtime, and it was overkill
    because the "only once a minute" means that you can't really tell an
    idle person from an active one with 'w'.
    
    So this tries to fix the problem properly.  It marks the shared ptmx
    node as un-notifiable, and it lowers the "only once a minute" to a few
    seconds instead - still long enough that you can't time individual
    keystrokes, but short enough that you can tell whether somebody is
    active or not.

    entry in the top level (pgd) covering 1GB of virtual space.  Because of
    the branch relocation limitations on ARM, the loadable modules are
    mapped 16MB below PAGE_OFFSET, making the corresponding 1GB pgd shared
    between kernel modules and user space.
    
    If free_pgtables() is called with the default ceiling 0,
    free_pgd_range() (and subsequently called functions) also frees the page
    table shared between user space and kernel modules (which is normally
    handled by the ARM-specific pgd_free() function).  This patch changes
    defines the ARM USER_PGTABLES_CEILING to TASK_SIZE when CONFIG_ARM_LPAE
    is enabled.
    
    Note that the pgd_free() function already checks the presence of the
    shared pmd page allocated by pgd_alloc() and frees it, though with
    ceiling 0 this wasn't necessary.

    serial_core.c: add put_device() after device_find_child()
    
    commit 5a65dcc04cda41f4122aacc37a5a348454645399 upstream.
    
    The serial core uses device_find_child() but does not drop the reference to
    the retrieved child after using it. This patch add the missing put_device().
    
    What I have done to test this issue.
    
    I used a machine with an AMBA PL011 serial driver. I tested the patch on
    next-20120408 because the last branch [next-20120415] does not boot on this
    board.
    
    For test purpose, I added some pr_info() messages to print the refcount
    after device_find_child() (lines: 1937,2009), and after put_device()
    (lines: 1947, 2021).
    
    Boot the machine *without* put_device(). Then:
    
    echo reboot > /sys/power/disk
    echo disk > /sys/power/state
    [   87.058575] uart_suspend_port:1937 refcount 4
    [   87.058582] uart_suspend_port:1947 refcount 4
    [   87.098083] uart_resume_port:2009refcount 5
    [   87.098088] uart_resume_port:2021 refcount 5
    
    echo disk > /sys/power/state
    [  103.055574] uart_suspend_port:1937 refcount 6
    [  103.055580] uart_suspend_port:1947 refcount 6
    [  103.095322] uart_resume_port:2009 refcount 7
    [  103.095327] uart_resume_port:2021 refcount 7
    
    echo disk > /sys/power/state
    [  252.459580] uart_suspend_port:1937 refcount 8
    [  252.459586] uart_suspend_port:1947 refcount 8

    [  252.499616] uart_resume_port:2021 refcount 9
    
    The refcount continuously increased.
    
    Boot the machine *with* this patch. Then:
    
    echo reboot > /sys/power/disk
    echo disk > /sys/power/state
    [  159.333559] uart_suspend_port:1937 refcount 4
    [  159.333566] uart_suspend_port:1947 refcount 3
    [  159.372751] uart_resume_port:2009 refcount 4
    [  159.372755] uart_resume_port:2021 refcount 3
    
    echo disk > /sys/power/state
    [  185.713614] uart_suspend_port:1937 refcount 4
    [  185.713621] uart_suspend_port:1947 refcount 3
    [  185.752935] uart_resume_port:2009 refcount 4
    [  185.752940] uart_resume_port:2021 refcount 3
    
    echo disk > /sys/power/state
    [  207.458584] uart_suspend_port:1937 refcount 4
    [  207.458591] uart_suspend_port:1947 refcount 3

    [  207.498605] uart_resume_port:2021 refcount 3
    
    The refcount correctly handled.

    xen/smp/spinlock: Fix leakage of the spinlock interrupt line for every CPU online/offline
    
    commit 66ff0fe9e7bda8aec99985b24daad03652f7304e upstream.
    
    While we don't use the spinlock interrupt line (see for details
    commit f10cd522c5fbfec9ae3cc01967868c9c2401ed23 -
    xen: disable PV spinlocks on HVM) - we should still do the proper
    init / deinit sequence. We did not do that correctly and for the
    CPU init for PVHVM guest we would allocate an interrupt line - but
    failed to deallocate the old interrupt line.
    
    This resulted in leakage of an irq_desc but more importantly this splat
    as we online an offlined CPU:
    
    genirq: Flags mismatch irq 71. 0002cc20 (spinlock1) vs. 0002cc20 (spinlock1)

    xen/smp: Fix leakage of timer interrupt line for every CPU online/offline.
    
    commit 888b65b4bc5e7fcbbb967023300cd5d44dba1950 upstream.
    
    In the PVHVM path when we do CPU online/offline path we would
    leak the timer%d IRQ line everytime we do a offline event. The
    online path (xen_hvm_setup_cpu_clockevents via
    x86_cpuinit.setup_percpu_clockev) would allocate a new interrupt
    line for the timer%d.
    
    But we would still use the old interrupt line leading to:

    The solution to that is use kasprintf in the CPU hotplug path
    that 'online's the CPU. That is, do it in in xen_hvm_cpu_notify,
    and remove the call to in xen_hvm_setup_cpu_clockevents.
    
    Unfortunatly the later is not a good idea as the bootup path
    does not use xen_hvm_cpu_notify so we would end up never allocating
    timer%d interrupt lines when booting. As such add the check for
    atomic() to continue.

    s390/memory hotplug: prevent offline of active memory increments
    
    commit 94c163663fc1dcfc067a5fb3cc1446b9469975ce upstream.
    
    In case a machine supports memory hotplug all active memory increments
    present at IPL time have been initialized with a "usecount" of 1.
    This is wrong if the memory increment size is larger than the memory
    section size of the memory hotplug code. If that is the case the
    usecount must be initialized with the number of memory sections that
    fit into one memory increment.
    Otherwise it is possible to put a memory increment into standby state
    even if there are still active sections.
    Afterwards addressing exceptions might happen which cause the kernel
    to panic.
    However even worse, if a memory increment was put into standby state
    and afterwards into active state again, it's contents would have been
    zeroed, leading to memory corruption.
    
    This was only an issue for machines that support standby memory and
    have at least 256GB memory.
    
    This is broken since commit fdb1bb15 "[S390] sclp/memory hotplug: fix
    initial usecount of increments".

    usb-storage: CY7C68300A chips do not support Cypress ATACB
    
    commit 671b4b2ba9266cbcfe7210a704e9ea487dcaa988 upstream.
    
    Many cards based on CY7C68300A/B/C use the USB ID 04b4:6830 but only the
    B and C variants (EZ-USB AT2LP) support the ATA Command Block
    functionality, according to the data sheets. The A variant (EZ-USB AT2)
    locks up if ATACB is attempted, until a typical 30 seconds timeout runs
    out and a USB reset is performed.
    
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/428469
    
    It seems that one way to spot a CY7C68300A (at least where the card
    manufacturer left Cypress' EEPROM default vaules, against Cypress'
    recommendations) is to look at the USB string descriptor indices.
    
    A http://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Cypress%20PDFs/CY7C68300A.pdf
    B http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/43456.pdf
    C http://www.cypress.com/?rID=14189
    
    Note that a CY7C68300B/C chip appears as CY7C68300A if it is running
    in Backward Compatibility Mode, and if ATACB would be supported in this
    case there is anyway no way to tell which chip it really is.
    
    For 5 years my external USB drive has been locking up for half a minute
    when plugged in and ata_id is run by udev, or anytime hdparm or similar
    is run on it.
    
    Finally looking at the /correct/ datasheet I think I found the reason. I
    am aware the quirk in this patch is a bit hacky, but the hardware
    manufacturers haven't made it easy for us.

    usb: chipidea: udc: fix memory access of shared memory on armv5 machines
    
    commit a9c174302b1590ef3ead485d804a303c5f89174b upstream.
    
    The udc uses an shared dma memory space between hard and software. This
    memory layout is described in ci13xxx_qh and ci13xxx_td which are marked
    with the attribute ((packed)).
    
    The compiler currently does not know about the alignment of the memory
    layout, and will create strb and ldrb operations.
    
    The Datasheet of the synopsys core describes, that some operations on
    the mapped memory need to be atomic double word operations. I.e. the
    next pointer addressing in the qhead, as otherwise the hardware will
    read wrong data and totally stuck.
    
    This is also possible while working with the current active td queue,
    and preparing the td->ptr.next in software while the hardware is still
    working with the current active td which is supposed to be changed:
    
    writeb(0xde, &td->ptr.next + 0x0); /* strb */
    writeb(0xad, &td->ptr.next + 0x1); /* strb */
    
    <----- hardware reads value of td->ptr.next and get stuck!
    
    writeb(0xbe, &td->ptr.next + 0x2); /* strb */
    writeb(0xef, &td->ptr.next + 0x3); /* strb */
    
    This appeares on armv5 machines where the hardware does not support
    unaligned 32bit operations.
    
    This patch adds the attribute ((aligned(4))) to the structures to tell
    the compiler to use 32bit operations. It also adds an wmb() for the
    prepared TD data before it gets enqueued into the qhead.

    usbfs: Always allow ctrl requests with USB_RECIP_ENDPOINT on the ctrl ep
    
    commit 1361bf4b9f9ef45e628a5b89e0fd9bedfdcb7104 upstream.
    
    When usbfs receives a ctrl-request from userspace it calls check_ctrlrecip,
    which for a request with USB_RECIP_ENDPOINT tries to map this to an interface
    to see if this interface is claimed, except for ctrl-requests with a type of
    USB_TYPE_VENDOR.
    
    When trying to use this device: http://www.akaipro.com/eiepro
    redirected to a Windows vm running on qemu on top of Linux.
    
    The windows driver makes a ctrl-req with USB_TYPE_CLASS and
    USB_RECIP_ENDPOINT with index 0, and the mapping of the endpoint (0) to
    the interface fails since ep 0 is the ctrl endpoint and thus never is
    part of an interface.
    
    This patch fixes this ctrl-req failing by skipping the checkintf call for
    USB_RECIP_ENDPOINT ctrl-reqs on the ctrl endpoint.

    USB: ftdi_sio: enable two UART ports on ST Microconnect Lite
    
    commit 71d9a2b95fc9c9474d46d764336efd7a5a805555 upstream.
    
    The FT4232H used in the ST Micro Connect Lite has four hi-speed UART ports.
    The first two ports are reserved for the JTAG interface.
    
    We enable by default ports 2 and 3 as UARTs (where port 2 is a
    conventional RS-232 UART)

    commit 9f06d15f8db6946e41f73196a122b84a37938878 upstream.
    
    The current ST Micro Connect Lite uses the FT4232H hi-speed quad USB
    UART FTDI chip. It is also possible to drive STM reference targets
    populated with an on-board JTAG debugger based on the FT2232H chip with
    the same STMicroelectronics tools.
    
    For this reason, the ST Micro Connect Lite PIDs should be
    ST_STMCLT_2232_PID: 0x3746
    ST_STMCLT_4232_PID: 0x3747

    mac80211: fix station entry leak/warning while suspending
    
    commit b20d34c458bc2bbd0a4624f2933581e01e72d875 upstream.
    
    Since Stanislaw's patches, when suspending while connected,
    cfg80211 will disconnect. This causes the AP station to be
    removed, which uses call_rcu() to clean up. Due to needing
    process context, this queues a work struct on the mac80211
    workqueue. This will warn and fail when already suspended,
    which can happen if the rcu call doesn't happen quickly.
    
    To fix this, replace the synchronize_net() which is really
    just synchronize_rcu_expedited() with rcu_barrier(), which
    unlike synchronize_rcu() waits until RCU callback have run
    and thus avoids this issue.
    
    In theory, this can even happen without Stanislaw's change
    to disconnect on suspend since userspace might disconnect
    just before suspending, though then it's unlikely that the
    call_rcu() will be delayed long enough.

    commit 8c2a381734fc9718f127f4aba958e8a7958d4028 upstream.
    
    In __restore_cpu_power8 we determine if we are HV and if not, we return
    before setting HV only resources.
    
    Unfortunately we forgot to restore the link register from r11 before
    returning.
    
    This will happen on boot and with secondary CPUs not coming online.
    
    This adds the missing link register restore.

    powerpc: Fix hardware IRQs with MMU on exceptions when HV=0
    
    commit 3e96ca7f007ddb06b82a74a68585d1dbafa85ff1 upstream.
    
    POWER8 allows us to take interrupts with the MMU on.  This gives us a
    second set of vectors offset at 0x4000.
    
    Unfortunately when coping these vectors we missed checking for MSR HV
    for hardware interrupts (0x500).  This results in us trying to use
    HSRR0/1 when HV=0, rather than SRR0/1 on HW IRQs
    
    The below fixes this to check CPU_FTR_HVMODE when patching the code at
    0x4500.
    
    Also we remove the check for CPU_FTR_ARCH_206 since relocation on IRQs
    are only available in arch 2.07 and beyond.
    
    Thanks to benh for helping find this.

    powerpc: Add isync to copy_and_flush
    
    commit 29ce3c5073057991217916abc25628e906911757 upstream.
    
    In __after_prom_start we copy the kernel down to zero in two calls to
    copy_and_flush.  After the first call (copy from 0 to copy_to_here:)
    we jump to the newly copied code soon after.
    
    Unfortunately there's no isync between the copy of this code and the
    jump to it.  Hence it's possible that stale instructions could still be
    in the icache or pipeline before we branch to it.
    
    We've seen this on real machines and it's results in no console output
    after:
      calling quiesce...
      returning from prom_init
    
    The below adds an isync to ensure that the copy and flushing has
    completed before any branching to the new instructions occurs.

    Testing the arm chromebook config against the upstream
    kernel produces a linker error for the zsmalloc module from
    staging. The symbol flush_tlb_kernel_range is not available
    there. Fix this by removing the reimplementation of
    unmap_kernel_range in the zsmalloc module and using the
    function directly. The unmap_kernel_range function is not
    usable by modules, so also disallow building the driver as a
    module for now.
