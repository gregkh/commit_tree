    pagemap: do not leak physical addresses to non-privileged userspace
    
    commit ab676b7d6fbf4b294bf198fb27ade5b0e865c7ce upstream.
    
    As pointed by recent post[1] on exploiting DRAM physical imperfection,
    /proc/PID/pagemap exposes sensitive information which can be used to do
    attacks.
    
    This disallows anybody without CAP_SYS_ADMIN to read the pagemap.

    [ Eventually we might want to do anything more finegrained, but for now
      this is the simple model.   - Linus ]

    console: Fix console name size mismatch
    
    commit 30a22c215a0007603ffc08021f2e8b64018517dd upstream.
    
    commit 6ae9200f2cab7 ("enlarge console.name") increased the storage
    for the console name to 16 bytes, but not the corresponding
    struct console_cmdline::name storage. Console names longer than
    8 bytes cause read beyond end-of-string and failure to match
    console; I'm not sure if there are other unexpected consequences.

    iscsi target: fix oops when adding reject pdu
    
    commit b815fc12d4dd2b5586184fb4f867caff05a810d4 upstream.
    
    This fixes a oops due to a double list add when adding a reject PDU for
    iscsit_allocate_iovecs allocation failures. The cmd has already been
    added to the conn_cmd_list in iscsit_setup_scsi_cmd, so this has us call
    iscsit_reject_cmd.
    
    Note that for ERL0 the reject PDU is not actually sent, so this patch
    is not completely tested. Just verified we do not oops. The problem is the
    add reject functions return -1 which is returned all the way up to
    iscsi_target_rx_thread which for ERL0 will drop the connection.

    *ppos, aka iocb->ki_pos is incremented prior to that point,

    cifs: fix use-after-free bug in find_writable_file
    
    commit e1e9bda22d7ddf88515e8fe401887e313922823e upstream.
    
    Under intermittent network outages, find_writable_file() is susceptible
    to the following race condition, which results in a user-after-free in
    the cifs_writepages code-path:
    
    Thread 1                                        Thread 2
    ========                                        ========
    
    inv_file = NULL
    refind = 0
    spin_lock(&cifs_file_list_lock)
    
    // invalidHandle found on openFileList
    
    inv_file = open_file
    // inv_file->count currently 1
    
    cifsFileInfo_get(inv_file)
    // inv_file->count = 2
    
    spin_unlock(&cifs_file_list_lock);
    
    cifs_reopen_file()                            cifs_close()
    // fails (rc != 0)                            ->cifsFileInfo_put()
                                           spin_lock(&cifs_file_list_lock)
                                           // inv_file->count = 1
                                           spin_unlock(&cifs_file_list_lock)
    
    spin_lock(&cifs_file_list_lock);
    list_move_tail(&inv_file->flist,
          &cifs_inode->openFileList);
    spin_unlock(&cifs_file_list_lock);
    
    cifsFileInfo_put(inv_file);
    ->spin_lock(&cifs_file_list_lock)
    
      // inv_file->count = 0
      list_del(&cifs_file->flist);
      // cleanup!!
      kfree(cifs_file);
    
      spin_unlock(&cifs_file_list_lock);
    
    spin_lock(&cifs_file_list_lock);
    ++refind;
    // refind = 1
    goto refind_writable;
    
    At this point we loop back through with an invalid inv_file pointer
    and a refind value of 1. On second pass, inv_file is not overwritten on
    openFileList traversal, and is subsequently dereferenced.

    usb: xhci: apply XHCI_AVOID_BEI quirk to all Intel xHCI controllers
    
    commit 227a4fd801c8a9fa2c4700ab98ec1aec06e3b44d upstream.
    
    When a device with an isochronous endpoint is plugged into the Intel
    xHCI host controller, and the driver submits multiple frames per URB,
    the xHCI driver will set the Block Event Interrupt (BEI) flag on all
    but the last TD for the URB. This causes the host controller to place
    an event on the event ring, but not send an interrupt. When the last
    TD for the URB completes, BEI is cleared, and we get an interrupt for
    the whole URB.
    
    However, under Intel xHCI host controllers, if the event ring is full
    of events from transfers with BEI set,  an "Event Ring is Full" event
    will be posted to the last entry of the event ring,  but no interrupt
    is generated. Host will cease all transfer and command executions and
    wait until software completes handling the pending events in the event
    ring.  That means xHC stops, but event of "event ring is full" is not
    notified. As the result, the xHC looks like dead to user.
    
    This patch is to apply XHCI_AVOID_BEI quirk to Intel xHC devices. And
    it should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, that contains the
    commit 69e848c2090a ("Intel xhci: Support EHCI/xHCI port switching.").

    cpuidle: ACPI: do not overwrite name and description of C0
    
    commit c7e8bdf5872c5a8f5a6494e16fe839c38a0d3d3d upstream.
    
    Fix a bug that leads to showing the name and description of C-state C0

    or DC->AC
    transition).
    
    The function poll_idle_init() in drivers/cpuidle/driver.c initializes the
    state 0 during cpuidle_register_driver(), so we better do not overwrite it
    again with '\0' during acpi_processor_cst_has_changed().

    dmaengine: omap-dma: Fix memory leak when terminating running transfer
    
    commit 02d88b735f5a60f04dbf6d051b76e1877a0d0844 upstream.
    
    In omap_dma_start_desc the vdesc->node is removed from the virt-dma
    framework managed lists (to be precise from the desc_issued list).
    If a terminate_all comes before the transfer finishes the omap_desc will
    not be freed up because it is not in any of the lists and we stopped the
    DMA channel so the transfer will not going to complete.
    There is no special sequence for leaking memory when using cyclic (audio)
    transfer: with every start and stop of a cyclic transfer the driver leaks
    struct omap_desc worth of memory.
    
    Free up the allocated memory directly in omap_dma_terminate_all() since the
    framework will not going to do that for us.

    iio: inv_mpu6050: Clear timestamps fifo while resetting hardware fifo
    
    commit 4dac0a8eefd55bb1f157d1a5a084531334a2d74c upstream.
    
    A hardware fifo reset always imply an invalidation of the
    existing timestamps, so we'll clear timestamps fifo on
    successfull hardware fifo reset.

    Defer processing of REQ_PREEMPT requests for blocked devices
    
    commit bba0bdd7ad4713d82338bcd9b72d57e9335a664b upstream.
    
    SCSI transport drivers and SCSI LLDs block a SCSI device if the
    transport layer is not operational. This means that in this state
    no requests should be processed, even if the REQ_PREEMPT flag has
    been set. This patch avoids that a rescan shortly after a cable
    pull sporadically triggers the following kernel oops:

    2f800fbd777b ("writeback: fix dirtied pages accounting on redirty")
    introduced account_page_redirty() which reverts stat updates for a
    redirtied page, making BDI_DIRTIED no longer monotonically increasing.
    
    bdi_update_write_bandwidth() uses the delta in BDI_DIRTIED as the
    basis for bandwidth calculation.  While unlikely, since the above
    patch, the newer value may be lower than the recorded past value and
    underflow the bandwidth calculation leading to a wild result.
    
    Fix it by subtracing min of the old and new values when calculating
    delta.  AFAIK, there hasn't been any report of it happening but the
    resulting erratic behavior would be non-critical and temporary, so
    it's possible that the issue is happening without being reported.  The
    risk of the fix is very low, so tagged for -stable.

    writeback: add missing INITIAL_JIFFIES init in global_update_bandwidth()
    
    commit 7d70e15480c0450d2bfafaad338a32e884fc215e upstream.
    
    global_update_bandwidth() uses static variable update_time as the
    timestamp for the last update but forgets to initialize it to
    INITIALIZE_JIFFIES.
    
    This means that global_dirty_limit will be 5 mins into the future on
    32bit and some large amount jiffies into the past on 64bit.  This
    isn't critical as the only effect is that global_dirty_limit won't be
    updated for the first 5 mins after booting on 32bit machines,
    especially given the auxiliary nature of global_dirty_limit's role -
    protecting against global dirty threshold's sudden dips; however, it
    does lead to unintended suboptimal behavior.  Fix it.

    The cause is the "memset(pgdat, 0, sizeof(*pgdat))" at the end of
    try_offline_node, which will reset all the content of pgdat to 0, as the
    pgdat is accessed lock-free, so that the users still using the pgdat
    will panic, such as the vmstat_update routine.
    
    process A:                              offline node XX:
    
    vmstat_updat()
       refresh_cpu_vm_stats()
         for_each_populated_zone()
           find online node XX
         cond_resched()
                                            offline cpu and memory, then try_offline_node()
                                            node_set_offline(nid), and memset(pgdat, 0, sizeof(*pgdat))
           zone = next_zone(zone)
             pg_data_t *pgdat = zone->zone_pgdat;  // here pgdat is NULL now
               next_online_pgdat(pgdat)
                 next_online_node(pgdat->node_id);  // NULL pointer access
    
    So the solution here is postponing the reset of obsolete pgdat from
    try_offline_node() to hotadd_new_pgdat(), and just resetting
    pgdat->nr_zones and pgdat->classzone_idx to be 0 rather than the memset
    0 to avoid breaking pointer information in pgdat.

    commit 9c8928f5176766bec79f272bd47b7124e11cccbd upstream.
    
    The assumption before this patch was that we don't need to
    run again the INIT firmware after the system booted. The
    INIT firmware runs calibrations which impact the physical
    layer's behavior.
    Users reported that it may be helpful to run these
    calibrations again every time the interface is brought up.
    The penatly is minimal, since the calibrations run fast.
    This fixes:

    IB/uverbs: Prevent integer overflow in ib_umem_get address arithmetic
    
    commit 8494057ab5e40df590ef6ef7d66324d3ae33356b upstream.
    
    Properly verify that the resulting page aligned end address is larger
    than both the start address and the length of the memory area requested.
    
    Both the start and length arguments for ib_umem_get are controlled by
    the user. A misbehaving user can provide values which will cause an
    integer overflow when calculating the page aligned end address.
    
    This overflow can cause also miscalculation of the number of pages
    mapped, and additional logic issues.

    tcp: Fix crash in TCP Fast Open
    
    Commit 355a901e6cf1 ("tcp: make connect() mem charging friendly")
    changed tcp_send_syn_data() to perform an open-coded copy of the 'syn'
    skb rather than using skb_copy_expand().
    
    The open-coded copy does not cover the skb_shared_info::gso_segs
    field, so in the new skb it is left set to 0.  When this commit was
    backported into stable branches between 3.10.y and 3.16.7-ckty
    inclusive, it triggered the BUG() in tcp_transmit_skb().
    
    Since Linux 3.18 the GSO segment count is kept in the
    tcp_skb_cb::tcp_gso_segs field and tcp_send_syn_data() does copy the
    tcp_skb_cb structure to the new skb, so mainline and newer stable
    branches are not affected.
    
    Set skb_shared_info::gso_segs to the correct value of 1.

    ALSA: hda - Fix headphone pin config for Lifebook T731
    
    commit cc7016ab1a22fb26f388c2fb2b692b89897cbc3e upstream.
    
    Some BIOS version of Fujitsu Lifebook T731 seems to set up the
    headphone pin (0x21) without the assoc number 0x0f while it's set only
    to the output on the docking port (0x1a).  With the recent commit
    [03ad6a8c93b6: ALSA: hda - Fix "PCM" name being used on one DAC when
     there are two DACs], this resulted in the weird mixer element
    mapping where the headphone on the laptop is assigned as a shared
    volume with the speaker and the docking port is assigned as an
    individual headphone.
    
    This patch improves the situation by correcting the headphone pin
    config to the more appropriate value.

    ALSA: hda - Add one more node in the EAPD supporting candidate list
    
    commit af95b41426e0b58279f8ff0ebe420df49a4e96b8 upstream.
    
    We have a HP machine which use the codec node 0x17 connecting the
    internal speaker, and from the node capability, we saw the EAPD,
    if we don't set the EAPD on for this node, the internal speaker
    can't output any sound.
