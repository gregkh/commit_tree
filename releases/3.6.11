    sctp: fix -ENOMEM result with invalid user space pointer in sendto() syscall
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e51fe7572590d8d86e93b547fab6693d305fd0d ]
    
    Consider the following program, that sets the second argument to the
    sendto() syscall incorrectly:
    
     #include <string.h>
     #include <arpa/inet.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>
    
     int main(void)
     {
             int fd;
             struct sockaddr_in sa;
    
             fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 132 /*IPPROTO_SCTP*/);
             if (fd < 0)
                     return 1;
    
             memset(&sa, 0, sizeof(sa));
             sa.sin_family = AF_INET;
             sa.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");
             sa.sin_port = htons(11111);
    
             sendto(fd, NULL, 1, 0, (struct sockaddr *)&sa, sizeof(sa));
    
             return 0;
     }
    
    We get -ENOMEM:
    
     $ strace -e sendto ./demo
     sendto(3, NULL, 1, 0, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(11111), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, 16) = -1 ENOMEM (Cannot allocate memory)
    
    Propagate the error code from sctp_user_addto_chunk(), so that we will
    tell user space what actually went wrong:
    
     $ strace -e sendto ./demo
     sendto(3, NULL, 1, 0, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(11111), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, 16) = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)
    
    Noticed while running Trinity (the syscall fuzzer).

    sctp: fix memory leak in sctp_datamsg_from_user() when copy from user space fails
    
    [ Upstream commit be364c8c0f17a3dd42707b5a090b318028538eb9 ]
    
    Trinity (the syscall fuzzer) discovered a memory leak in SCTP,
    reproducible e.g. with the sendto() syscall by passing invalid
    user space pointer in the second argument:
    
     #include <string.h>
     #include <arpa/inet.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>
    
     int main(void)
     {
             int fd;
             struct sockaddr_in sa;
    
             fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 132 /*IPPROTO_SCTP*/);
             if (fd < 0)
                     return 1;
    
             memset(&sa, 0, sizeof(sa));
             sa.sin_family = AF_INET;
             sa.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");
             sa.sin_port = htons(11111);
    
             sendto(fd, NULL, 1, 0, (struct sockaddr *)&sa, sizeof(sa));
    
             return 0;
     }
    
    As far as I can tell, the leak has been around since ~2003.

    net: cdc_ncm: add Huawei devices
    
    [ Upstream commit bbc8d9228ea8e37ce29fa96150d10b85a2c7be60 ]
    
    A number of Huawei 3G and LTE modems implement a CDC NCM function,
    including the necessary functional descriptors, but using a non
    standard interface layout and class/subclass/protocol codes.
    
    These devices can be handled by this driver with only a minor
    change to the probing logic, allowing a single combined control
    and data interface.  This works because the devices
    - include a CDC Union descriptor labelling the combined
      interface as both master and slave, and
    - have an alternate setting #1 for the bulk endpoints on the
      combined interface.
    
    The 3G/LTE network connection is managed by vendor specific AT
    commands on a serial function in the same composite device.
    Handling the managment function is out of the scope of this
    driver.  It will be handled by an appropriate USB serial
    driver.

    inet_diag: validate port comparison byte code to prevent unsafe reads
    
    [ Upstream commit 5e1f54201cb481f40a04bc47e1bc8c093a189e23 ]
    
    Add logic to verify that a port comparison byte code operation
    actually has the second inet_diag_bc_op from which we read the port
    for such operations.
    
    Previously the code blindly referenced op[1] without first checking
    whether a second inet_diag_bc_op struct could fit there. So a
    malicious user could make the kernel read 4 bytes beyond the end of
    the bytecode array by claiming to have a whole port comparison byte
    code (2 inet_diag_bc_op structs) when in fact the bytecode was not
    long enough to hold both.

    inet_diag: avoid unsafe and nonsensical prefix matches in inet_diag_bc_run()
    
    [ Upstream commit f67caec9068cee426ec23cf9005a1dee2ecad187 ]
    
    Add logic to check the address family of the user-supplied conditional
    and the address family of the connection entry. We now do not do
    prefix matching of addresses from different address families (AF_INET
    vs AF_INET6), except for the previously existing support for having an
    IPv4 prefix match an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address (which this commit
    maintains as-is).
    
    This change is needed for two reasons:
    
    (1) The addresses are different lengths, so comparing a 128-bit IPv6
    prefix match condition to a 32-bit IPv4 connection address can cause
    us to unwittingly walk off the end of the IPv4 address and read
    garbage or oops.
    
    (2) The IPv4 and IPv6 address spaces are semantically distinct, so a
    simple bit-wise comparison of the prefixes is not meaningful, and
    would lead to bogus results (except for the IPv4-mapped IPv6 case,
    which this commit maintains).

    operations.
    
    Previously we did not validate the inet_diag_hostcond, address family,
    address length, and prefix length. So a malicious user could make the
    kernel read beyond the end of the bytecode array by claiming to have a
    whole inet_diag_hostcond when the bytecode was not long enough to
    contain a whole inet_diag_hostcond of the given address family. Or
    they could make the kernel read up to about 27 bytes beyond the end of
    a connection address by passing a prefix length that exceeded the
    length of addresses of the given family.

    inet_diag: fix oops for IPv4 AF_INET6 TCP SYN-RECV state
    
    [ Upstream commit 1c95df85ca49640576de2f0a850925957b547b84 ]
    
    Fix inet_diag to be aware of the fact that AF_INET6 TCP connections
    instantiated for IPv4 traffic and in the SYN-RECV state were actually
    created with inet_reqsk_alloc(), instead of inet6_reqsk_alloc(). This
    means that for such connections inet6_rsk(req) returns a pointer to a
    random spot in memory up to roughly 64KB beyond the end of the
    request_sock.
    
    With this bug, for a server using AF_INET6 TCP sockets and serving
    IPv4 traffic, an inet_diag user like `ss state SYN-RECV` would lead to
    inet_diag_fill_req() causing an oops or the export to user space of 16
    bytes of kernel memory as a garbage IPv6 address, depending on where
    the garbage inet6_rsk(req) pointed.

    [ Upstream commit 1bf3751ec90cc3174e01f0d701e8449ce163d113 ]
    
    ip_check_defrag() might be called from af_packet within the
    RX path where shared SKBs are used, so it must not modify
    the input SKB before it has unshared it for defragmentation.
    Use skb_copy_bits() to get the IP header and only pull in
    everything later.
    
    The same is true for the other caller in macvlan as it is
    called from dev->rx_handler which can also get a shared SKB.

    ipv4: do not cache looped multicasts
    
    [ Upstream commit 636174219b52b5a8bc51bc23bbcba97cd30a65e3 ]
    
            Starting from 3.6 we cache output routes for
    multicasts only when using route to 224/4. For local receivers
    we can set RTCF_LOCAL flag depending on the membership but
    in such case we use maddr and saddr which are not caching
    keys as before. Additionally, we can not use same place to
    cache routes that differ in RTCF_LOCAL flag value.
    
            Fix it by caching only RTCF_MULTICAST entries
    without RTCF_LOCAL (send-only, no loopback). As a side effect,
    we avoid unneeded lookup for fnhe when not caching because
    multicasts are not redirected and they do not learn PMTU.
    
            Thanks to Maxime Bizon for showing the caching
    problems in __mkroute_output for 3.6 kernels: different
    RTCF_LOCAL flag in cache can lead to wrong ip_mc_output or
    ip_output call and the visible problem is that traffic can
    not reach local receivers via loopback.

    If we do not do device_lock in pci_walk_bus, we can avoid deadlock.
    Device_lock in pci_walk_bus is introduced in commit:
    d71374dafbba7ec3f67371d3b7e9f6310a588808, corresponding email thread
    is: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/26/38.  The patch author Zhang Yanmin
    said device_lock is added to pci_walk_bus because:
    
      Some error handling functions call pci_walk_bus. For example, PCIe
      aer. Here we lock the device, so the driver wouldn't detach from the
      device, as the cb might call driver's callback function.
    
    So I fixed the deadlock as follows:
    
    - remove device_lock from pci_walk_bus
    - add device_lock into callback if callback will call driver's callback
    
    I checked pci_walk_bus users one by one, and found only PCIe aer needs
    device lock.

    rcu: Fix batch-limit size problem
    
    commit 878d7439d0f45a95869e417576774673d1fa243f upstream.
    
    Commit 29c00b4a1d9e27 (rcu: Add event-tracing for RCU callback
    invocation) added a regression in rcu_do_batch()
    
    Under stress, RCU is supposed to allow to process all items in queue,
    instead of a batch of 10 items (blimit), but an integer overflow makes
    the effective limit being 1.  So, unless there is frequent idle periods
    (during which RCU ignores batch limits), RCU can be forced into a
    state where it cannot keep up with the callback-generation rate,
    eventually resulting in OOM.
    
    This commit therefore converts a few variables in rcu_do_batch() from
    int to long to fix this problem, along with the module parameters
    controlling the batch limits.

    USB: EHCI: bugfix: urb->hcpriv should not be NULL
    
    commit 2656a9abcf1ec8dd5fee6a75d6997a0f2fa0094e upstream.
    
    This patch (as1632b) fixes a bug in ehci-hcd.  The USB core uses
    urb->hcpriv to determine whether or not an URB is active; host
    controller drivers are supposed to set this pointer to a non-NULL
    value when an URB is queued.  However ehci-hcd sets it to NULL for
    isochronous URBs, which defeats the check in usbcore.
    
    In itself this isn't a big deal.  But people have recently found that
    certain sequences of actions will cause the snd-usb-audio driver to
    reuse URBs without waiting for them to complete.  In the absence of
    proper checking by usbcore, the URBs get added to their endpoint list
    twice.  This leads to list corruption and a system freeze.
    
    The patch makes ehci-hcd assign a meaningful value to urb->hcpriv for
    isochronous URBs.  Improving robustness always helps.

    perf test: fix a build error on builtin-test
    
    commit 12f8f74b2a4d26c4facfa7ef99487cf0930f6ef7 upstream.
    
    Recently I build perf and get a build error on builtin-test.c. The error is as
    following:
    
    $ make
        CC perf.o
        CC builtin-test.o

    make: *** [builtin-test.o] Error 1
    
    This problem is introduced in 3e7c439a. CPU_ALLOC and related macros are
    missing in sched__get_first_possible_cpu function. In 54489c18, commiter
    mentioned that CPU_ALLOC has been removed. So CPU_ALLOC calls in this
    function are removed to let perf to be built.

    cdc-acm: implement TIOCSSERIAL to avoid blocking close(2)
    
    commit ba2d8ce9db0a61505362bb17b8899df3d3326146 upstream.
    
    Some devices (ex Nokia C7) simply don't respond at all when data is sent
    to some of their USB interfaces.  The data gets stuck in the TTYs queue
    and sits there until close(2), which them blocks because closing_wait
    defaults to 30 seconds (even though the fd is O_NONBLOCK).  This is
    rarely desired.  Implement the standard mechanism to adjust closing_wait
    and let applications handle it how they want to.

    ring-buffer: Fix race between integrity check and readers
    
    commit 9366c1ba13fbc41bdb57702e75ca4382f209c82f upstream.
    
    The function rb_check_pages() was added to make sure the ring buffer's
    pages were sane. This check is done when the ring buffer size is modified
    as well as when the iterator is released (closing the "trace" file),
    as that was considered a non fast path and a good place to do a sanity
    check.
    
    The problem is that the check does not have any locks around it.
    If one process were to read the trace file, and another were to read
    the raw binary file, the check could happen while the reader is reading
    the file.
    
    The issues with this is that the check requires to clear the HEAD page
    before doing the full check and it restores it afterward. But readers
    require the HEAD page to exist before it can read the buffer, otherwise
    it gives a nasty warning and disables the buffer.
    
    By adding the reader lock around the check, this keeps the race from
    happening.

    ring-buffer: Fix NULL pointer if rb_set_head_page() fails
    
    commit 54f7be5b831254199522523ccab4c3d954bbf576 upstream.
    
    The function rb_set_head_page() searches the list of ring buffer
    pages for a the page that has the HEAD page flag set. If it does
    not find it, it will do a WARN_ON(), disable the ring buffer and
    return NULL, as this should never happen.
    
    But if this bug happens to happen, not all callers of this function
    can handle a NULL pointer being returned from it. That needs to be
    fixed.

    xhci: Extend Fresco Logic MSI quirk.
    
    commit bba18e33f25072ebf70fd8f7f0cdbf8cdb59a746 upstream.
    
    Ali reports that plugging a device into the Fresco Logic xHCI host with
    PCI device ID 1400 produces an IRQ error:
    
     do_IRQ: 3.176 No irq handler for vector (irq -1)
    
    Other early Fresco Logic host revisions don't support MSI, even though
    their PCI config space claims they do.  Extend the quirk to disabling
    MSI to this chipset revision.  Also enable the short transfer quirk,
    since it's likely this revision also has that quirk, and it should be
    harmless to enable.

    USB: OHCI: workaround for hardware bug: retired TDs not added to the Done Queue
    
    commit 50ce5c0683aa83eb161624ea89daa5a9eee0c2ce upstream.
    
    This patch (as1636) is a partial workaround for a hardware bug
    affecting OHCI controllers by NVIDIA at least, maybe others too.  When
    the controller retires a Transfer Descriptor, it is supposed to add
    the TD onto the Done Queue.  But sometimes this doesn't happen, with
    the result that ohci-hcd never realizes the corresponding transfer has
    finished.  Symptoms can vary; a typical result is that USB audio stops
    working after a while.
    
    The patch works around the problem by recognizing that TDs are always
    processed in order.  Therefore, if a later TD is found on the Done
    Queue than all the earlier TDs for the same endpoint must be finished
    as well.
    
    Unfortunately this won't solve the problem in cases where the missing
    TD is the last one in the endpoint's queue.  A complete fix would
    require a signficant amount of change to the driver.

    ACPI / PNP: Do not crash due to stale pointer use during system resume
    
    commit a6b5e88c0e42093b9057856f35770966c8c591e3 upstream.
    
    During resume from system suspend the 'data' field of
    struct pnp_dev in pnpacpi_set_resources() may be a stale pointer,
    due to removal of the associated ACPI device node object in the
    previous suspend-resume cycle.  This happens, for example, if a
    dockable machine is booted in the docking station and then suspended
    and resumed and suspended again.  If that happens,
    pnpacpi_build_resource_template() called from pnpacpi_set_resources()
    attempts to use that pointer and crashes.
    
    However, pnpacpi_set_resources() actually checks the device's ACPI
    handle, attempts to find the ACPI device node object attached to it
    and returns an error code if that fails, so in fact it knows what the
    correct value of dev->data should be.  Use this observation to update
    dev->data with the correct value if necessary and dump a call trace
    if that's the case (once).
    
    We still need to fix the root cause of this issue, but preventing
    systems from crashing because of it is an improvement too.

    ACPI / battery: Correct battery capacity values on Thinkpads
    
    commit 4000e626156935dfb626321ce09cae2c833eabbb upstream.
    
    Add a quirk to correctly report battery capacity on 2010 and 2011
    Lenovo Thinkpad models.
    
    The affected models that I tested (x201, t410, t410s, and x220)
    exhibit a problem where, when battery capacity reporting unit is mAh,
    the values being reported are wrong.  Pre-2010 and 2012 models appear
    to always report in mWh and are thus unaffected.  Also, in mid-2012
    Lenovo issued a BIOS update for the 2011 models that fixes the issue
    (tested on x220 with a post-1.29 BIOS).  No such update is available
    for the 2010 models, so those still need this patch.
    
    Problem description: for some reason, the affected Thinkpads switch
    the reporting unit between mAh and mWh; generally, mAh is used when a
    laptop is plugged in and mWh when it's unplugged, although a
    suspend/resume or rmmod/modprobe is needed for the switch to take
    effect.  The values reported in mAh are *always* wrong.  This does
    not appear to be a kernel regression; I believe that the values were
    never reported correctly.  I tested back to kernel 2.6.34, with
    multiple machines and BIOS versions.
    
    Simply plugging a laptop into mains before turning it on is enough to
    reproduce the problem.  Here's a sample /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info
    from Thinkpad x220 (before a BIOS update) with a 4-cell battery:
    
    present:                 yes
    design capacity:         2886 mAh
    last full capacity:      2909 mAh
    battery technology:      rechargeable
    design voltage:          14800 mV
    design capacity warning: 145 mAh
    design capacity low:     13 mAh
    cycle count:              0
    capacity granularity 1:  1 mAh
    capacity granularity 2:  1 mAh
    model number:            42T4899
    serial number:           21064
    battery type:            LION
    OEM info:                SANYO
    
    Once the laptop switches the unit to mWh (unplug from mains, suspend,
    resume), the output changes to:
    
    present:                 yes
    design capacity:         28860 mWh
    last full capacity:      29090 mWh
    battery technology:      rechargeable
    design voltage:          14800 mV
    design capacity warning: 1454 mWh
    design capacity low:     200 mWh
    cycle count:              0
    capacity granularity 1:  1 mWh
    capacity granularity 2:  1 mWh
    model number:            42T4899
    serial number:           21064
    battery type:            LION
    OEM info:                SANYO
    
    Can you see how the values for "design capacity", etc., differ by a
    factor of 10 instead of 14.8 (the design voltage of this battery)?
    On the battery itself it says: 14.8V, 1.95Ah, 29Wh, so clearly the
    values reported in mWh are correct and the ones in mAh are not.
    
    My guess is that this problem has been around ever since those
    machines were released, but because the most common Thinkpad
    batteries are rated at 10.8V, the error (8%) is small enough that it
    simply hasn't been noticed or at least nobody could be bothered to
    look into it.
    
    My patch works around the problem by adjusting the incorrectly
    reported mAh values by "10000 / design_voltage".  The patch also has
    code to figure out if it should be activated or not.  It only
    activates on Lenovo Thinkpads, only when the unit is mAh, and, as an
    extra precaution, only when the battery capacity reported through
    ACPI does not match what is reported through DMI (I've never
    encountered a machine where the first two conditions would be true
    but the last would not, but better safe than sorry).
    
    I've been using this patch for close to a year on several systems
    without any problems.

    USB: option: blacklist network interface on Huawei E173
    
    commit f36446cf9bbebaa03a80d95cfeeafbaf68218249 upstream.
    
    The Huawei E173 will normally appear as 12d1:1436 in Linux.  But

    HPET_TN_FSB is not a proper mask bit; it merely toggles between MSI and

    mm: dmapool: use provided gfp flags for all dma_alloc_coherent() calls
    
    commit 387870f2d6d679746020fa8e25ef786ff338dc98 upstream.
    
    dmapool always calls dma_alloc_coherent() with GFP_ATOMIC flag,
    regardless the flags provided by the caller. This causes excessive
    pruning of emergency memory pools without any good reason. Additionaly,
    on ARM architecture any driver which is using dmapools will sooner or
    later  trigger the following error:
    "ERROR: 256 KiB atomic DMA coherent pool is too small!
    Please increase it with coherent_pool= kernel parameter!".
    Increasing the coherent pool size usually doesn't help much and only
    delays such error, because all GFP_ATOMIC DMA allocations are always
    served from the special, very limited memory pool.
    
    This patch changes the dmapool code to correctly use gfp flags provided
    by the dmapool caller.

    workqueue: convert BUG_ON()s in __queue_delayed_work() to WARN_ON_ONCE()s
    
    commit fc4b514f2727f74a4587c31db87e0e93465518c3 upstream.
    
    8852aac25e ("workqueue: mod_delayed_work_on() shouldn't queue timer on
    0 delay") unexpectedly uncovered a very nasty abuse of delayed_work in
    megaraid - it allocated work_struct, casted it to delayed_work and
    then pass that into queue_delayed_work().
    
    Previously, this was okay because 0 @delay short-circuited to
    queue_work() before doing anything with delayed_work.  8852aac25e
    moved 0 @delay test into __queue_delayed_work() after sanity check on
    delayed_work making megaraid trigger BUG_ON().
    
    Although megaraid is already fixed by c1d390d8e6 ("megaraid: fix
    BUG_ON() from incorrect use of delayed work"), this patch converts
    BUG_ON()s in __queue_delayed_work() to WARN_ON_ONCE()s so that such
    abusers, if there are more, trigger warning but don't crash the
    machine.

    edac: Fix the dimm filling for csrows-based layouts
    
    commit 24bef66e74d647aebd34e0bef7693512b7912029 upstream.
    
    The driver is currently filling data in a wrong way, on drivers
    for csrows-based memory controller, when the first layer is a
    csrow.
    
    This is not easily to notice, as, in general, memories are
    filed in dual, interleaved, symetric mode, as very few memory
    controllers support asymetric modes.
    
    While digging into a bug for i82795_edac driver, the asymetric
    mode there is now working, allowing us to fill the machine with
    4x1GB ranks at channel 0, and 2x512GB at channel 1:
    
    Channel 0 ranks:
    EDAC DEBUG: i82975x_init_csrows: DIMM A0: from page 0x00000000 to 0x0003ffff (size: 0x00040000 pages)
    EDAC DEBUG: i82975x_init_csrows: DIMM A1: from page 0x00040000 to 0x0007ffff (size: 0x00040000 pages)
    EDAC DEBUG: i82975x_init_csrows: DIMM A2: from page 0x00080000 to 0x000bffff (size: 0x00040000 pages)
    EDAC DEBUG: i82975x_init_csrows: DIMM A3: from page 0x000c0000 to 0x000fffff (size: 0x00040000 pages)
    
    Channel 1 ranks:
    EDAC DEBUG: i82975x_init_csrows: DIMM B0: from page 0x00100000 to 0x0011ffff (size: 0x00020000 pages)
    EDAC DEBUG: i82975x_init_csrows: DIMM B1: from page 0x00120000 to 0x0013ffff (size: 0x00020000 pages)
    
    Instead of properly showing the memories as such, before this patch, it
    shows the memory layout as:
    
              +-----------------------------------+
              |                mc0                |
              |  csrow0   |  csrow1   |  csrow2   |
    ----------+-----------------------------------+
    channel1: |  1024 MB  |  1024 MB  |   512 MB  |
    channel0: |  1024 MB  |  1024 MB  |   512 MB  |
    ----------+-----------------------------------+
    
    as if both channels were symetric, grouping the DIMMs on a wrong
    layout.
    
    After this patch, the memory is correctly represented.
    So, for csrows at layers[0], it shows:
    
              +-----------------------------------------------+
              |                      mc0                      |
              |  csrow0   |  csrow1   |  csrow2   |  csrow3   |
    ----------+-----------------------------------------------+
    channel1: |   512 MB  |   512 MB  |     0 MB  |     0 MB  |
    channel0: |  1024 MB  |  1024 MB  |  1024 MB  |  1024 MB  |
    ----------+-----------------------------------------------+
    
    For csrows at layers[1], it shows:
    
            +-----------------------+
            |          mc0          |
            | channel0  | channel1  |
    --------+-----------------------+
    csrow3: |  1024 MB  |     0 MB  |
    csrow2: |  1024 MB  |     0 MB  |
    --------+-----------------------+
    csrow1: |  1024 MB  |   512 MB  |
    csrow0: |  1024 MB  |   512 MB  |
    --------+-----------------------+
    
    So, no matter of what comes first, the information between
    channel and csrow will be properly represented.

    i82975x_edac: Fix dimm label initialization
    
    commit 479696840239e0cc43efb3c917bdcad2174d2215 upstream.
    
    The driver has only 4 hardcoded labels, but allows much more memory.
    Fix it by removing the hardcoded logic, using snprintf() instead.

    ARM: 7566/1: vfp: fix save and restore when running on pre-VFPv3 and CONFIG_VFPv3 set
    
    commit 39141ddfb63a664f26d3f42f64ee386e879b492c upstream.
    
    After commit 846a136881b8f73c1f74250bf6acfaa309cab1f2 ("ARM: vfp: fix
    saving d16-d31 vfp registers on v6+ kernels"), the OMAP 2430SDP board

    [    4.107666] LR is at __und_usr_fault_32+0x0/0x8
    
    It turns out that the context save/restore fix unmasked a latent bug
    in commit 5aaf254409f8d58229107b59507a8235b715a960 ("ARM: 6203/1: Make
    VFPv3 usable on ARMv6").  When CONFIG_VFPv3 is set, but the kernel is
    booted on a pre-VFPv3 core, the code attempts to save and restore the
    d16-d31 VFP registers.  These are only present on non-D16 VFPv3+, so
    this results in an undefined instruction exception.  The code didn't
    crash before commit 846a136 because the save and restore code was
    only touching d0-d15, present on all VFP.
    
    Fix by implementing a request from Russell King to add a new HWCAP
    flag that affirmatively indicates the presence of the d16-d31
    registers:
    
       http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=135013547905283&w=2
    
    and some feedback from Måns to clarify the name of the HWCAP flag.

    On some systems, e.g., kzm9g, MMCIF interfaces can produce spurious
    interrupts without any active request. To prevent the Oops, that results
    in such cases, don't dereference the mmc request pointer until we make
    sure, that we are indeed processing such a request.

    tmpfs: fix shared mempolicy leak
    
    commit 18a2f371f5edf41810f6469cb9be39931ef9deb9 upstream.
    
    This fixes a regression in 3.7-rc, which has since gone into stable.
    
    Commit 00442ad04a5e ("mempolicy: fix a memory corruption by refcount
    imbalance in alloc_pages_vma()") changed get_vma_policy() to raise the
    refcount on a shmem shared mempolicy; whereas shmem_alloc_page() went
    on expecting alloc_page_vma() to drop the refcount it had acquired.
    This deserves a rework: but for now fix the leak in shmem_alloc_page().
    
    Hugh: shmem_swapin() did not need a fix, but surely it's clearer to use
    the same refcounting there as in shmem_alloc_page(), delete its onstack
    mempolicy, and the strange mpol_cond_copy() and __mpol_cond_copy() -
    those were invented to let swapin_readahead() make an unknown number of
    calls to alloc_pages_vma() with one mempolicy; but since 00442ad04a5e,
    alloc_pages_vma() has kept refcount in balance, so now no problem.
