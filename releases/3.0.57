    powerpc: Keep thread.dscr and thread.dscr_inherit in sync
    
    commit 00ca0de02f80924dfff6b4f630e1dff3db005e35 upstream.
    
    When we update the DSCR either via emulation of mtspr(DSCR) or via
    a change to dscr_default in sysfs we don't update thread.dscr.
    We will eventually update it at context switch time but there is
    a period where thread.dscr is incorrect.
    
    If we fork at this point we will copy the old value of thread.dscr
    into the child. To avoid this, always keep thread.dscr in sync with
    reality.

    powerpc: Update DSCR on all CPUs when writing sysfs dscr_default
    
    commit 1b6ca2a6fe56e7697d57348646e07df08f43b1bb upstream.
    
    Writing to dscr_default in sysfs doesn't actually change the DSCR -
    we rely on a context switch on each CPU to do the work. There is no
    guarantee we will get a context switch in a reasonable amount of time
    so fire off an IPI to force an immediate change.

    xhci: Extend Fresco Logic MSI quirk.
    
    commit bba18e33f25072ebf70fd8f7f0cdbf8cdb59a746 upstream.
    
    Ali reports that plugging a device into the Fresco Logic xHCI host with
    PCI device ID 1400 produces an IRQ error:
    
     do_IRQ: 3.176 No irq handler for vector (irq -1)
    
    Other early Fresco Logic host revisions don't support MSI, even though
    their PCI config space claims they do.  Extend the quirk to disabling
    MSI to this chipset revision.  Also enable the short transfer quirk,
    since it's likely this revision also has that quirk, and it should be
    harmless to enable.

    USB: OHCI: workaround for hardware bug: retired TDs not added to the Done Queue
    
    commit 50ce5c0683aa83eb161624ea89daa5a9eee0c2ce upstream.
    
    This patch (as1636) is a partial workaround for a hardware bug
    affecting OHCI controllers by NVIDIA at least, maybe others too.  When
    the controller retires a Transfer Descriptor, it is supposed to add
    the TD onto the Done Queue.  But sometimes this doesn't happen, with
    the result that ohci-hcd never realizes the corresponding transfer has
    finished.  Symptoms can vary; a typical result is that USB audio stops
    working after a while.
    
    The patch works around the problem by recognizing that TDs are always
    processed in order.  Therefore, if a later TD is found on the Done
    Queue than all the earlier TDs for the same endpoint must be finished
    as well.
    
    Unfortunately this won't solve the problem in cases where the missing
    TD is the last one in the endpoint's queue.  A complete fix would
    require a signficant amount of change to the driver.

    ACPI / PNP: Do not crash due to stale pointer use during system resume
    
    commit a6b5e88c0e42093b9057856f35770966c8c591e3 upstream.
    
    During resume from system suspend the 'data' field of
    struct pnp_dev in pnpacpi_set_resources() may be a stale pointer,
    due to removal of the associated ACPI device node object in the
    previous suspend-resume cycle.  This happens, for example, if a
    dockable machine is booted in the docking station and then suspended
    and resumed and suspended again.  If that happens,
    pnpacpi_build_resource_template() called from pnpacpi_set_resources()
    attempts to use that pointer and crashes.
    
    However, pnpacpi_set_resources() actually checks the device's ACPI
    handle, attempts to find the ACPI device node object attached to it
    and returns an error code if that fails, so in fact it knows what the
    correct value of dev->data should be.  Use this observation to update
    dev->data with the correct value if necessary and dump a call trace
    if that's the case (once).
    
    We still need to fix the root cause of this issue, but preventing
    systems from crashing because of it is an improvement too.

    ACPI / battery: Correct battery capacity values on Thinkpads
    
    commit 4000e626156935dfb626321ce09cae2c833eabbb upstream.
    
    Add a quirk to correctly report battery capacity on 2010 and 2011
    Lenovo Thinkpad models.
    
    The affected models that I tested (x201, t410, t410s, and x220)
    exhibit a problem where, when battery capacity reporting unit is mAh,
    the values being reported are wrong.  Pre-2010 and 2012 models appear
    to always report in mWh and are thus unaffected.  Also, in mid-2012
    Lenovo issued a BIOS update for the 2011 models that fixes the issue
    (tested on x220 with a post-1.29 BIOS).  No such update is available
    for the 2010 models, so those still need this patch.
    
    Problem description: for some reason, the affected Thinkpads switch
    the reporting unit between mAh and mWh; generally, mAh is used when a
    laptop is plugged in and mWh when it's unplugged, although a
    suspend/resume or rmmod/modprobe is needed for the switch to take
    effect.  The values reported in mAh are *always* wrong.  This does
    not appear to be a kernel regression; I believe that the values were
    never reported correctly.  I tested back to kernel 2.6.34, with
    multiple machines and BIOS versions.
    
    Simply plugging a laptop into mains before turning it on is enough to
    reproduce the problem.  Here's a sample /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info
    from Thinkpad x220 (before a BIOS update) with a 4-cell battery:
    
    present:                 yes
    design capacity:         2886 mAh
    last full capacity:      2909 mAh
    battery technology:      rechargeable
    design voltage:          14800 mV
    design capacity warning: 145 mAh
    design capacity low:     13 mAh
    cycle count:              0
    capacity granularity 1:  1 mAh
    capacity granularity 2:  1 mAh
    model number:            42T4899
    serial number:           21064
    battery type:            LION
    OEM info:                SANYO
    
    Once the laptop switches the unit to mWh (unplug from mains, suspend,
    resume), the output changes to:
    
    present:                 yes
    design capacity:         28860 mWh
    last full capacity:      29090 mWh
    battery technology:      rechargeable
    design voltage:          14800 mV
    design capacity warning: 1454 mWh
    design capacity low:     200 mWh
    cycle count:              0
    capacity granularity 1:  1 mWh
    capacity granularity 2:  1 mWh
    model number:            42T4899
    serial number:           21064
    battery type:            LION
    OEM info:                SANYO
    
    Can you see how the values for "design capacity", etc., differ by a
    factor of 10 instead of 14.8 (the design voltage of this battery)?
    On the battery itself it says: 14.8V, 1.95Ah, 29Wh, so clearly the
    values reported in mWh are correct and the ones in mAh are not.
    
    My guess is that this problem has been around ever since those
    machines were released, but because the most common Thinkpad
    batteries are rated at 10.8V, the error (8%) is small enough that it
    simply hasn't been noticed or at least nobody could be bothered to
    look into it.
    
    My patch works around the problem by adjusting the incorrectly
    reported mAh values by "10000 / design_voltage".  The patch also has
    code to figure out if it should be activated or not.  It only
    activates on Lenovo Thinkpads, only when the unit is mAh, and, as an
    extra precaution, only when the battery capacity reported through
    ACPI does not match what is reported through DMI (I've never
    encountered a machine where the first two conditions would be true
    but the last would not, but better safe than sorry).
    
    I've been using this patch for close to a year on several systems
    without any problems.

    commit 6acf5a8c931da9d26c8dd77d784daaf07fa2bff0 upstream.
    
    HPET_TN_FSB is not a proper mask bit; it merely toggles between MSI and
    legacy interrupt delivery. The proper mask bit is HPET_TN_ENABLE, so
    use both bits when (un)masking the interrupt.

    tmpfs: fix shared mempolicy leak
    
    commit 18a2f371f5edf41810f6469cb9be39931ef9deb9 upstream.
    
    This fixes a regression in 3.7-rc, which has since gone into stable.
    
    Commit 00442ad04a5e ("mempolicy: fix a memory corruption by refcount
    imbalance in alloc_pages_vma()") changed get_vma_policy() to raise the
    refcount on a shmem shared mempolicy; whereas shmem_alloc_page() went
    on expecting alloc_page_vma() to drop the refcount it had acquired.
    This deserves a rework: but for now fix the leak in shmem_alloc_page().
    
    Hugh: shmem_swapin() did not need a fix, but surely it's clearer to use
    the same refcounting there as in shmem_alloc_page(), delete its onstack
    mempolicy, and the strange mpol_cond_copy() and __mpol_cond_copy() -
    those were invented to let swapin_readahead() make an unknown number of
    calls to alloc_pages_vma() with one mempolicy; but since 00442ad04a5e,
    alloc_pages_vma() has kept refcount in balance, so now no problem.

    mm: dmapool: use provided gfp flags for all dma_alloc_coherent() calls
    
    commit 387870f2d6d679746020fa8e25ef786ff338dc98 upstream.
    
    dmapool always calls dma_alloc_coherent() with GFP_ATOMIC flag,
    regardless the flags provided by the caller. This causes excessive
    pruning of emergency memory pools without any good reason. Additionaly,
    on ARM architecture any driver which is using dmapools will sooner or
    later  trigger the following error:
    "ERROR: 256 KiB atomic DMA coherent pool is too small!
    Please increase it with coherent_pool= kernel parameter!".
    Increasing the coherent pool size usually doesn't help much and only
    delays such error, because all GFP_ATOMIC DMA allocations are always
    served from the special, very limited memory pool.
    
    This patch changes the dmapool code to correctly use gfp flags provided
    by the dmapool caller.

    workqueue: convert BUG_ON()s in __queue_delayed_work() to WARN_ON_ONCE()s
    
    commit fc4b514f2727f74a4587c31db87e0e93465518c3 upstream.
    
    8852aac25e ("workqueue: mod_delayed_work_on() shouldn't queue timer on
    0 delay") unexpectedly uncovered a very nasty abuse of delayed_work in
    megaraid - it allocated work_struct, casted it to delayed_work and
    then pass that into queue_delayed_work().
    
    Previously, this was okay because 0 @delay short-circuited to
    queue_work() before doing anything with delayed_work.  8852aac25e
    moved 0 @delay test into __queue_delayed_work() after sanity check on
    delayed_work making megaraid trigger BUG_ON().
    
    Although megaraid is already fixed by c1d390d8e6 ("megaraid: fix
    BUG_ON() from incorrect use of delayed work"), this patch converts
    BUG_ON()s in __queue_delayed_work() to WARN_ON_ONCE()s so that such
    abusers, if there are more, trigger warning but don't crash the
    machine.

    powerpc/ptrace: Fix build with gcc 4.6
    
    commit e69b742a6793dc5bf16f6eedca534d4bc10d68b2 upstream.
    
    gcc (rightfully) complains that we are accessing beyond the
    end of the fpr array (we do, to access the fpscr).
    
    The only sane thing to do (whether anything in that code can be
    called remotely sane is debatable) is to special case fpscr and
    handle it as a separate statement.
    
    I initially tried to do it it by making the array access conditional
    to index < PT_FPSCR and using a 3rd else leg but for some reason gcc
    was unable to understand it and still spewed the warning.
    
    So I ended up with something a tad more intricated but it seems to
    build on 32-bit and on 64-bit with and without VSX.

    ARM: 7566/1: vfp: fix save and restore when running on pre-VFPv3 and CONFIG_VFPv3 set
    
    commit 39141ddfb63a664f26d3f42f64ee386e879b492c upstream.
    
    After commit 846a136881b8f73c1f74250bf6acfaa309cab1f2 ("ARM: vfp: fix
    saving d16-d31 vfp registers on v6+ kernels"), the OMAP 2430SDP board
    started crashing during boot with omap2plus_defconfig:
    
    [    3.875122] mmcblk0: mmc0:e624 SD04G 3.69 GiB
    [    3.915954]  mmcblk0: p1
    [    4.086639] Internal error: Oops - undefined instruction: 0 [#1] SMP ARM
    [    4.093719] Modules linked in:
    [    4.096954] CPU: 0    Not tainted  (3.6.0-02232-g759e00b #570)
    [    4.103149] PC is at vfp_reload_hw+0x1c/0x44
    [    4.107666] LR is at __und_usr_fault_32+0x0/0x8
    
    It turns out that the context save/restore fix unmasked a latent bug
    in commit 5aaf254409f8d58229107b59507a8235b715a960 ("ARM: 6203/1: Make
    VFPv3 usable on ARMv6").  When CONFIG_VFPv3 is set, but the kernel is
    booted on a pre-VFPv3 core, the code attempts to save and restore the
    d16-d31 VFP registers.  These are only present on non-D16 VFPv3+, so
    this results in an undefined instruction exception.  The code didn't
    crash before commit 846a136 because the save and restore code was
    only touching d0-d15, present on all VFP.
    
    Fix by implementing a request from Russell King to add a new HWCAP
    flag that affirmatively indicates the presence of the d16-d31
    registers:
    
       http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=135013547905283&w=2
    
    and some feedback from Måns to clarify the name of the HWCAP flag.
