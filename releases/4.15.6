    vmalloc: fix __GFP_HIGHMEM usage for vmalloc_32 on 32b systems
    
    commit 698d0831ba87b92ae10b15e8203cfd59f5a59a35 upstream.
    
    Kai Heng Feng has noticed that BUG_ON(PageHighMem(pg)) triggers in
    drivers/media/common/saa7146/saa7146_core.c since 19809c2da28a ("mm,
    vmalloc: use __GFP_HIGHMEM implicitly").
    
    saa7146_vmalloc_build_pgtable uses vmalloc_32 and it is reasonable to
    expect that the resulting page is not in highmem.  The above commit
    aimed to add __GFP_HIGHMEM only for those requests which do not specify
    any zone modifier gfp flag.  vmalloc_32 relies on GFP_VMALLOC32 which
    should do the right thing.  Except it has been missed that GFP_VMALLOC32
    is an alias for GFP_KERNEL on 32b architectures.  Thanks to Matthew to
    notice this.
    
    Fix the problem by unconditionally setting GFP_DMA32 in GFP_VMALLOC32
    for !64b arches (as a bailout).  This should do the right thing and use
    ZONE_NORMAL which should be always below 4G on 32b systems.

    xhci: fix xhci debugfs errors in xhci_stop
    
    commit 11cd764dc9a030991880ad4d51db93918afa5822 upstream.
    
    In function xhci_stop, xhci_debugfs_exit called before xhci_mem_cleanup.
    xhci_debugfs_exit removed the xhci debugfs root nodes, xhci_mem_cleanup
    called function xhci_free_virt_devices_depth_first which in turn called
    function xhci_debugfs_remove_slot.
    Function xhci_debugfs_remove_slot removed the nodes for devices, the nodes
    folders are sub folder of xhci debugfs.
    
    It is unreasonable to remove xhci debugfs root folder before
    xhci debugfs sub folder. Function xhci_mem_cleanup should be called
    before function xhci_debugfs_exit.

    xhci: Fix xhci debugfs devices node disappearance after hibernation
    
    commit d91676717261578f429d3577dbe9154b26e8abf7 upstream.
    
    During system resume from hibernation, xhci host is reset, all the
    nodes in devices folder are removed in xhci_mem_cleanup function.
    Later nodes in /sys/kernel/debug/usb/xhci/* are created again in
    function xhci_run, but the nodes already exist, so the nodes still
    keep the old ones, finally device nodes in xhci debugfs folder
    /sys/kernel/debug/usb/xhci/*/devices/* are disappeared.
    
    This fix removed xhci debugfs nodes before the nodes are re-created,
    so all the nodes in xhci debugfs can be re-created successfully.

    xhci: Fix NULL pointer in xhci debugfs
    
    commit fa2dfd0ec22e0069c84dfae162972cbbc7c75488 upstream.
    
    Commit dde634057da7 ("xhci: Fix use-after-free in xhci debugfs") causes a
    null pointer dereference while fixing xhci-debugfs usage of ring pointers
    that were freed during hibernate.
    
    The fix passed addresses to ring pointers instead, but forgot to do this
    change for the xhci_ring_trb_show function.
    
    The address of the ring pointer passed to xhci-debugfs was of a temporary
    ring pointer "new_ring" instead of the actual ring "ring" pointer. The
    temporary new_ring pointer will be set to NULL later causing the NULL
    pointer dereference.
    
    This issue was seen when reading xhci related files in debugfs:

    commit 7d2b8e6aaf9ee87910c2337e1c59bb5d3e3ba8c5 upstream.
    
    Since commit 152a6a884ae1 ("staging:iio:accel:sca3000 move
    to hybrid hard / soft buffer design.")
    the buffer mechanism has changed and the
    INDIO_BUFFER_HARDWARE flag has been unused.
    
    Since commit 2d6ca60f3284 ("iio: Add a DMAengine framework
    based buffer")
    the INDIO_BUFFER_HARDWARE flag has been re-purposed for
    DMA buffers.
    
    This driver has lagged behind these changes, and
    in order for buffers to work, the INDIO_BUFFER_SOFTWARE
    needs to be used.

    The external clock frequency was set only when selecting
    the internal clock, which is fixed at 4.9152 Mhz.
    
    This is incorrect, since it should be set when any of
    the external clock or crystal settings is selected.

    frequency setting.
    Valid values are between 2.4576 and 5.12 Mhz.

    ANDROID: binder: remove WARN() for redundant txn error
    
    commit e46a3b3ba7509cb7fda0e07bc7c63a2cd90f579b upstream.
    
    binder_send_failed_reply() is called when a synchronous
    transaction fails. It reports an error to the thread that
    is waiting for the completion. Given that the transaction
    is synchronous, there should never be more than 1 error
    response to that thread -- this was being asserted with
    a WARN().
    
    However, when exercising the driver with syzbot tests, cases
    were observed where multiple "synchronous" requests were
    sent without waiting for responses, so it is possible that
    multiple errors would be reported to the thread. This testing
    was conducted with panic_on_warn set which forced the crash.
    
    This is easily reproduced by sending back-to-back
    "synchronous" transactions without checking for any
    response (eg, set read_size to 0):
    
        bwr.write_buffer = (uintptr_t)&bc1;
        bwr.write_size = sizeof(bc1);
        bwr.read_buffer = (uintptr_t)&br;
        bwr.read_size = 0;
        ioctl(fd, BINDER_WRITE_READ, &bwr);
        sleep(1);
        bwr2.write_buffer = (uintptr_t)&bc2;
        bwr2.write_size = sizeof(bc2);
        bwr2.read_buffer = (uintptr_t)&br;
        bwr2.read_size = 0;
        ioctl(fd, BINDER_WRITE_READ, &bwr2);
        sleep(1);
    
    The first transaction is sent to the servicemanager and the reply
    fails because no VMA is set up by this client. After
    binder_send_failed_reply() is called, the BINDER_WORK_RETURN_ERROR
    is sitting on the thread's todo list since the read_size was 0 and
    the client is not waiting for a response.
    
    The 2nd transaction is sent and the BINDER_WORK_RETURN_ERROR has not
    been consumed, so the thread's reply_error.cmd is still set (normally
    cleared when the BINDER_WORK_RETURN_ERROR is handled). Therefore
    when the servicemanager attempts to reply to the 2nd failed
    transaction, the error is already set and it triggers this warning.
    
    This is a user error since it is not waiting for the synchronous
    transaction to complete. If it ever does check, it will see an
    error.
    
    Changed the WARN() to a pr_warn().

    dn_getsockoptdecnet: move nf_{get/set}sockopt outside sock lock
    
    commit dfec091439bb2acf763497cfc58f2bdfc67c56b7 upstream.
    
    After commit 3f34cfae1238 ("netfilter: on sockopt() acquire sock lock
    only in the required scope"), the caller of nf_{get/set}sockopt() must
    not hold any lock, but, in such changeset, I forgot to cope with DECnet.
    
    This commit addresses the issue moving the nf call outside the lock,
    in the dn_{get,set}sockopt() with the same schema currently used by
    ipv4 and ipv6. Also moves the unhandled sockopts of the end of the main
    switch statements, to improve code readability.

    net_sched: gen_estimator: fix lockdep splat
    
    commit 40ca54e3a686f13117f3de0c443f8026dadf7c44 upstream.
    
    syzbot reported a lockdep splat in gen_new_estimator() /
    est_fetch_counters() when attempting to lock est->stats_lock.
    
    Since est_fetch_counters() is called from BH context from timer
    interrupt, we need to block BH as well when calling it from process
    context.
    
    Most qdiscs use per cpu counters and are immune to the problem,
    but net/sched/act_api.c and net/netfilter/xt_RATEEST.c are using
    a spinlock to protect their data. They both call gen_new_estimator()
    while object is created and not yet alive, so this bug could
    not trigger a deadlock, only a lockdep splat.

    net: avoid skb_warn_bad_offload on IS_ERR
    
    commit 8d74e9f88d65af8bb2e095aff506aa6eac755ada upstream.
    
    skb_warn_bad_offload warns when packets enter the GSO stack that
    require skb_checksum_help or vice versa. Do not warn on arbitrary
    bad packets. Packet sockets can craft many. Syzkaller was able to
    demonstrate another one with eth_type games.
    
    In particular, suppress the warning when segmentation returns an
    error, which is for reasons other than checksum offload.
    
    See also commit 36c92474498a ("net: WARN if skb_checksum_help() is

    rds: tcp: atomically purge entries from rds_tcp_conn_list during netns delete
    
    commit f10b4cff98c6977668434fbf5dd58695eeca2897 upstream.
    
    The rds_tcp_kill_sock() function parses the rds_tcp_conn_list
    to find the rds_connection entries marked for deletion as part
    of the netns deletion under the protection of the rds_tcp_conn_lock.
    Since the rds_tcp_conn_list tracks rds_tcp_connections (which
    have a 1:1 mapping with rds_conn_path), multiple tc entries in
    the rds_tcp_conn_list will map to a single rds_connection, and will
    be deleted as part of the rds_conn_destroy() operation that is
    done outside the rds_tcp_conn_lock.
    
    The rds_tcp_conn_list traversal done under the protection of
    rds_tcp_conn_lock should not leave any doomed tc entries in
    the list after the rds_tcp_conn_lock is released, else another
    concurrently executiong netns delete (for a differnt netns) thread
    may trip on these entries.

    rds: tcp: correctly sequence cleanup on netns deletion.
    
    commit 681648e67d43cf269c5590ecf021ed481f4551fc upstream.
    
    Commit 8edc3affc077 ("rds: tcp: Take explicit refcounts on struct net")
    introduces a regression in rds-tcp netns cleanup. The cleanup_net(),
    (and thus rds_tcp_dev_event notification) is only called from put_net()
    when all netns refcounts go to 0, but this cannot happen if the
    rds_connection itself is holding a c_net ref that it expects to
    release in rds_tcp_kill_sock.
    
    Instead, the rds_tcp_kill_sock callback should make sure to
    tear down state carefully, ensuring that the socket teardown
    is only done after all data-structures and workqs that depend
    on it are quiesced.
    
    The original motivation for commit 8edc3affc077 ("rds: tcp: Take explicit
    refcounts on struct net") was to resolve a race condition reported by
    syzkaller where workqs for tx/rx/connect were triggered after the
    namespace was deleted. Those worker threads should have been
    cancelled/flushed before socket tear-down and indeed,
    rds_conn_path_destroy() does try to sequence this by doing
         /* cancel cp_send_w */
         /* cancel cp_recv_w */
         /* flush cp_down_w */
         /* free data structures */
    Here the "flush cp_down_w" will trigger rds_conn_shutdown and thus
    invoke rds_tcp_conn_path_shutdown() to close the tcp socket, so that
    we ought to have satisfied the requirement that "socket-close is
    done after all other dependent state is quiesced". However,
    rds_conn_shutdown has a bug in that it *always* triggers the reconnect
    workq (and if connection is successful, we always restart tx/rx
    workqs so with the right timing, we risk the race conditions reported
    by syzkaller).
    
    Netns deletion is like module teardown- no need to restart a
    reconnect in this case. We can use the c_destroy_in_prog bit
    to avoid restarting the reconnect.

    commit 7dc68e98757a8eccf8ca7a53a29b896f1eef1f76 upstream.
    
    rateest_hash is supposed to be protected by xt_rateest_mutex,
    and, as suggested by Eric, lookup and insert should be atomic,
    so we should acquire the xt_rateest_mutex once for both.
    
    So introduce a non-locking helper for internal use and keep the
    locking one for external.

      *** DEADLOCK ***
    
    1 lock held by syzkaller041579/3682:
      #0:  (rtnl_mutex){+.+.}, at: [<000000004342eaa9>] rtnl_lock+0x17/0x20
    net/core/rtnetlink.c:74
    
    The problem, as Florian noted, is that nf_setsockopt() is always
    called with the socket held, even if the lock itself is required only
    for very tight scopes and only for some operation.
    
    This patch addresses the issues moving the lock_sock() call only
    where really needed, namely in ipv*_getorigdst(), so that nf_setsockopt()
    does not need anymore to acquire both locks.

    netfilter: ipt_CLUSTERIP: fix out-of-bounds accesses in clusterip_tg_check()
    
    commit 1a38956cce5eabd7b74f94bab70265e4df83165e upstream.
    
    Commit 136e92bbec0a switched local_nodes from an array to a bitmask
    but did not add proper bounds checks. As the result
    clusterip_config_init_nodelist() can both over-read
    ipt_clusterip_tgt_info.local_nodes and over-write
    clusterip_config.local_nodes.
    
    Add bounds checks for both.

    It looks like syzbot found its way into netfilter territory.
    
    Issue here is that @name comes from user space and might

    commit 889c604fd0b5f6d3b8694ade229ee44124de1127 upstream.
    
    syzkaller triggered OOM kills by passing ipt_replace.size = -1
    to IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE. The root cause is that SMP_ALIGN() in
    xt_alloc_table_info() causes int overflow and the size check passes
    when it should not. SMP_ALIGN() is no longer needed leftover.
    
    Remove SMP_ALIGN() call in xt_alloc_table_info().

    kcov: detect double association with a single task
    
    commit a77660d231f8b3d84fd23ed482e0964f7aa546d6 upstream.
    
    Currently KCOV_ENABLE does not check if the current task is already
    associated with another kcov descriptor.  As the result it is possible
    to associate a single task with more than one kcov descriptor, which
    later leads to a memory leak of the old descriptor.  This relation is
    really meant to be one-to-one (task has only one back link).
    
    Extend validation to detect such misuse.

    KVM: x86: fix escape of guest dr6 to the host

    The testcase sets a watchpoint (with perf_event_open) on a buffer that is
    passed to timer_create() as the struct sigevent argument.  In timer_create(),
    copy_from_user()'s rep movsb triggers the BP.  The testcase also sets
    the debug registers for the guest.
    
    However, KVM only restores host debug registers when the host has active
    watchpoints, which triggers a race condition when running the testcase with
    multiple threads.  The guest's DR6.BS bit can escape to the host before
    another thread invokes timer_create(), and do_debug() complains.
    
    The fix is to respect do_debug()'s dr6 invariant when leaving KVM.

    blk_rq_map_user_iov: fix error override
    
    commit 69e0927b3774563c19b5fb32e91d75edc147fb62 upstream.
    
    During stress tests by syzkaller on the sg driver the block layer
    infrequently returns EINVAL. Closer inspection shows the block
    layer was trying to return ENOMEM (which is much more
    understandable) but for some reason overroad that useful error.
    
    Patch below does not show this (unchanged) line:
       ret =__blk_rq_map_user_iov(rq, map_data, &i, gfp_mask, copy);
    That 'ret' was being overridden when that function failed.

    crypto: x86/twofish-3way - Fix %rbp usage
    
    commit d8c7fe9f2a486a6e5f0d5229ca43807af5ab22c6 upstream.
    
    Using %rbp as a temporary register breaks frame pointer convention and
    breaks stack traces when unwinding from an interrupt in the crypto code.
    
    In twofish-3way, we can't simply replace %rbp with another register
    because there are none available.  Instead, we use the stack to hold the
    values that %rbp, %r11, and %r12 were holding previously.  Each of these
    values represents the half of the output from the previous Feistel round
    that is being passed on unchanged to the following round.  They are only
    used once per round, when they are exchanged with %rax, %rbx, and %rcx.
    
    As a result, we free up 3 registers (one per block) and can reassign
    them so that %rbp is not used, and additionally %r14 and %r15 are not
    used so they do not need to be saved/restored.
    
    There may be a small overhead caused by replacing 'xchg REG, REG' with
    the needed sequence 'mov MEM, REG; mov REG, MEM; mov REG, REG' once per
    round.  But, counterintuitively, when I tested "ctr-twofish-3way" on a
    Haswell processor, the new version was actually about 2% faster.
    (Perhaps 'xchg' is not as well optimized as plain moves.)

    selinux: skip bounded transition processing if the policy isn't loaded
    
    commit 4b14752ec4e0d87126e636384cf37c8dd9df157c upstream.
    
    We can't do anything reasonable in security_bounded_transition() if we
    don't have a policy loaded, and in fact we could run into problems
    with some of the code inside expecting a policy.  Fix these problems
    like we do many others in security/selinux/ss/services.c by checking
    to see if the policy is loaded (ss_initialized) and returning quickly
    if it isn't.

    selinux: ensure the context is NUL terminated in security_context_to_sid_core()
    
    commit ef28df55ac27e1e5cd122e19fa311d886d47a756 upstream.
    
    The syzbot/syzkaller automated tests found a problem in
    security_context_to_sid_core() during early boot (before we load the
    SELinux policy) where we could potentially feed context strings without
    NUL terminators into the strcmp() function.
    
    We already guard against this during normal operation (after the SELinux
    policy has been loaded) by making a copy of the context strings and
    explicitly adding a NUL terminator to the end.  The patch extends this
    protection to the early boot case (no loaded policy) by moving the context
    copy earlier in security_context_to_sid_core().

    ptr_ring: fail early if queue occupies more than KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE
    
    commit 6e6e41c3112276288ccaf80c70916779b84bb276 upstream.
    
    To avoid slab to warn about exceeded size, fail early if queue
    occupies more than KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE.

    tun: fix tun_napi_alloc_frags() frag allocator
    
    commit 43a08e0f58b3f236165029710a4e3b303815253b upstream.
    
    <Mark Rutland reported>
        While fuzzing arm64 v4.16-rc1 with Syzkaller, I've been hitting a
        misaligned atomic in __skb_clone:
    
            atomic_inc(&(skb_shinfo(skb)->dataref));
    
       where dataref doesn't have the required natural alignment, and the
       atomic operation faults. e.g. i often see it aligned to a single
       byte boundary rather than a four byte boundary.
    
       AFAICT, the skb_shared_info is misaligned at the instant it's
       allocated in __napi_alloc_skb()  __napi_alloc_skb()
    </end of report>
    
    Problem is caused by tun_napi_alloc_frags() using
    napi_alloc_frag() with user provided seg sizes,
    leading to other users of this API getting unaligned
    page fragments.
    
    Since we would like to not necessarily add paddings or alignments to
    the frags that tun_napi_alloc_frags() attaches to the skb, switch to
    another page frag allocator.
    
    As a bonus skb_page_frag_refill() can use GFP_KERNEL allocations,
    meaning that we can not deplete memory reserves as easily.
