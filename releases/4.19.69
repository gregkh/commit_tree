    rxrpc: Fix local refcounting
    
    [ Upstream commit 68553f1a6f746bf860bce3eb42d78c26a717d9c0 ]
    
    Fix rxrpc_unuse_local() to handle a NULL local pointer as it can be called
    on an unbound socket on which rx->local is not yet set.
    
    The following reproduced (includes omitted):
    
            int main(void)

                    return 0;
            }
    
    causes the following oops to occur:

    rxrpc: Fix local endpoint replacement
    
    [ Upstream commit b00df840fb4004b7087940ac5f68801562d0d2de ]
    
    When a local endpoint (struct rxrpc_local) ceases to be in use by any
    AF_RXRPC sockets, it starts the process of being destroyed, but this
    doesn't cause it to be removed from the namespace endpoint list immediately
    as tearing it down isn't trivial and can't be done in softirq context, so
    it gets deferred.
    
    If a new socket comes along that wants to bind to the same endpoint, a new
    rxrpc_local object will be allocated and rxrpc_lookup_local() will use
    list_replace() to substitute the new one for the old.
    
    Then, when the dying object gets to rxrpc_local_destroyer(), it is removed
    unconditionally from whatever list it is on by calling list_del_init().
    
    However, list_replace() doesn't reset the pointers in the replaced
    list_head and so the list_del_init() will likely corrupt the local
    endpoints list.
    
    Fix this by using list_replace_init() instead.

    rxrpc: Fix read-after-free in rxrpc_queue_local()
    
    commit 06d9532fa6b34f12a6d75711162d47c17c1add72 upstream.
    
    rxrpc_queue_local() attempts to queue the local endpoint it is given and
    then, if successful, prints a trace line.  The trace line includes the
    current usage count - but we're not allowed to look at the local endpoint
    at this point as we passed our ref on it to the workqueue.
    
    Fix this by reading the usage count before queuing the work item.
    
    Also fix the reading of local->debug_id for trace lines, which must be done
    with the same consideration as reading the usage count.

    rxrpc: Fix local endpoint refcounting
    
    commit 730c5fd42c1e3652a065448fd235cb9fafb2bd10 upstream.
    
    The object lifetime management on the rxrpc_local struct is broken in that
    the rxrpc_local_processor() function is expected to clean up and remove an
    object - but it may get requeued by packets coming in on the backing UDP
    socket once it starts running.
    
    This may result in the assertion in rxrpc_local_rcu() firing because the
    memory has been scheduled for RCU destruction whilst still queued:
    
            rxrpc: Assertion failed
            ------------[ cut here ]------------
            kernel BUG at net/rxrpc/local_object.c:468!
    
    Note that if the processor comes around before the RCU free function, it
    will just do nothing because ->dead is true.
    
    Fix this by adding a separate refcount to count active users of the
    endpoint that causes the endpoint to be destroyed when it reaches 0.
    
    The original refcount can then be used to refcount objects through the work
    processor and cause the memory to be rcu freed when that reaches 0.

    powerpc: Allow flush_(inval_)dcache_range to work across ranges >4GB
    
    The upstream commit:
    22e9c88d486a ("powerpc/64: reuse PPC32 static inline flush_dcache_range()")
    has a similar effect, but since it is a rewrite of the assembler to C, is
    too invasive for stable. This patch is a minimal fix to address the issue in
    assembler.
    
    This patch applies cleanly to v5.2, v4.19 & v4.14.
    
    When calling flush_(inval_)dcache_range with a size >4GB, we were masking
    off the upper 32 bits, so we would incorrectly flush a range smaller
    than intended.
    
    This patch replaces the 32 bit shifts with 64 bit ones, so that
    the full size is accounted for.

    xfs: always rejoin held resources during defer roll
    
    commit 710d707d2fa9cf4c2aa9def129e71e99513466ea upstream.
    
    During testing of xfs/141 on a V4 filesystem, I observed some
    inconsistent behavior with regards to resources that are held (i.e.
    remain locked) across a defer roll.  The transaction roll always gives
    the defer roll function a new transaction, even if committing the old
    transaction fails.  However, the defer roll function only rejoins the
    held resources if the transaction commit succeedied.  This means that
    callers of defer roll have to figure out whether the held resources are
    attached to the transaction being passed back.
    
    Worse yet, if the defer roll was part of a defer finish call, we have a
    third possibility: the defer finish could pass back a dirty transaction
    with dirty held resources and an error code.
    
    The only sane way to handle all of these scenarios is to require that
    the code that held the resource either cancel the transaction before
    unlocking and releasing the resources, or use functions that detach
    resources from a transaction properly (e.g.  xfs_trans_brelse) if they
    need to drop the reference before committing or cancelling the
    transaction.
    
    In order to make this so, change the defer roll code to join held
    resources to the new transaction unconditionally and fix all the bhold
    callers to release the held buffers correctly.

    xfs: don't trip over uninitialized buffer on extent read of corrupted inode
    
    commit 6958d11f77d45db80f7e22a21a74d4d5f44dc667 upstream.
    
    We've had rather rare reports of bmap btree block corruption where
    the bmap root block has a level count of zero. The root cause of the
    corruption is so far unknown. We do have verifier checks to detect
    this form of on-disk corruption, but this doesn't cover a memory
    corruption variant of the problem. The latter is a reasonable
    possibility because the root block is part of the inode fork and can
    reside in-core for some time before inode extents are read.
    
    If this occurs, it leads to a system crash such as the following:
    
     BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffffff00000221
     PF error: [normal kernel read fault]

    assert to an explicit error check in xfs_iread_extents() to avoid
    crashing the kernel in the event of localized, in-core inode
    corruption.

    xfs: fix missing ILOCK unlock when xfs_setattr_nonsize fails due to EDQUOT
    
    commit 1fb254aa983bf190cfd685d40c64a480a9bafaee upstream.
    
    Benjamin Moody reported to Debian that XFS partially wedges when a chgrp
    fails on account of being out of disk quota.  I ran his reproducer
    script:
    
    # adduser dummy
    # adduser dummy plugdev
    
    # dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=100 of=test.img
    # mkfs.xfs test.img
    # mount -t xfs -o gquota test.img /mnt
    # mkdir -p /mnt/dummy
    # chown -c dummy /mnt/dummy
    # xfs_quota -xc 'limit -g bsoft=100k bhard=100k plugdev' /mnt
    
    (and then as user dummy)
    
    $ dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1M count=50 of=/mnt/dummy/foo
    $ chgrp plugdev /mnt/dummy/foo
    
    and saw:
    
    ================================================
    WARNING: lock held when returning to user space!
    5.3.0-rc5 #rc5 Tainted: G        W

    ...which is clearly caused by xfs_setattr_nonsize failing to unlock the

    mm/zsmalloc.c: fix race condition in zs_destroy_pool
    
    commit 701d678599d0c1623aaf4139c03eea260a75b027 upstream.
    
    In zs_destroy_pool() we call flush_work(&pool->free_work).  However, we
    have no guarantee that migration isn't happening in the background at
    that time.
    
    Since migration can't directly free pages, it relies on free_work being
    scheduled to free the pages.  But there's nothing preventing an
    in-progress migrate from queuing the work *after*
    zs_unregister_migration() has called flush_work().  Which would mean
    pages still pointing at the inode when we free it.
    
    Since we know at destroy time all objects should be free, no new
    migrations can come in (since zs_page_isolate() fails for fully-free
    zspages).  This means it is sufficient to track a "# isolated zspages"
    count by class, and have the destroy logic ensure all such pages have
    drained before proceeding.  Keeping that state under the class spinlock
    keeps the logic straightforward.
    
    In this case a memory leak could lead to an eventual crash if compaction
    hits the leaked page.  This crash would only occur if people are
    changing their zswap backend at runtime (which eventually starts
    destruction).

    mm/zsmalloc.c: migration can leave pages in ZS_EMPTY indefinitely
    
    commit 1a87aa03597efa9641e92875b883c94c7f872ccb upstream.
    
    In zs_page_migrate() we call putback_zspage() after we have finished
    migrating all pages in this zspage.  However, the return value is
    ignored.  If a zs_free() races in between zs_page_isolate() and
    zs_page_migrate(), freeing the last object in the zspage,
    putback_zspage() will leave the page in ZS_EMPTY for potentially an
    unbounded amount of time.
    
    To fix this, we need to do the same thing as zs_page_putback() does:
    schedule free_work to occur.
    
    To avoid duplicated code, move the sequence to a new
    putback_zspage_deferred() function which both zs_page_migrate() and
    zs_page_putback() call.

    mm, page_owner: handle THP splits correctly
    
    commit f7da677bc6e72033f0981b9d58b5c5d409fa641e upstream.
    
    THP splitting path is missing the split_page_owner() call that
    split_page() has.
    
    As a result, split THP pages are wrongly reported in the page_owner file
    as order-9 pages.  Furthermore when the former head page is freed, the
    remaining former tail pages are not listed in the page_owner file at
    all.  This patch fixes that by adding the split_page_owner() call into
    __split_huge_page().

    genirq: Properly pair kobject_del() with kobject_add()
    
    commit d0ff14fdc987303aeeb7de6f1bd72c3749ae2a9b upstream.
    
    If alloc_descs() fails before irq_sysfs_init() has run, free_desc() in the
    cleanup path will call kobject_del() even though the kobject has not been
    added with kobject_add().
    
    Fix this by making the call to kobject_del() conditional on whether
    irq_sysfs_init() has run.
    
    This problem surfaced because commit aa30f47cf666 ("kobject: Add support
    for default attribute groups to kobj_type") makes kobject_del() stricter
    about pairing with kobject_add(). If the pairing is incorrrect, a WARNING
    and backtrace occur in sysfs_remove_group() because there is no parent.
    
    [ tglx: Add a comment to the code and make it work with CONFIG_SYSFS=n ]

    dm zoned: properly handle backing device failure
    
    commit 75d66ffb48efb30f2dd42f041ba8b39c5b2bd115 upstream.
    
    dm-zoned is observed to lock up or livelock in case of hardware
    failure or some misconfiguration of the backing zoned device.
    
    This patch adds a new dm-zoned target function that checks the status of
    the backing device. If the request queue of the backing device is found
    to be in dying state or the SCSI backing device enters offline state,
    the health check code sets a dm-zoned target flag prompting all further
    incoming I/O to be rejected. In order to detect backing device failures
    timely, this new function is called in the request mapping path, at the
    beginning of every reclaim run and before performing any metadata I/O.
    
    The proper way out of this situation is to do
    
    dmsetup remove <dm-zoned target>
    
    and recreate the target when the problem with the backing device
    is resolved.

    dm zoned: improve error handling in i/o map code
    
    commit d7428c50118e739e672656c28d2b26b09375d4e0 upstream.
    
    Some errors are ignored in the I/O path during queueing chunks
    for processing by chunk works. Since at least these errors are
    transient in nature, it should be possible to retry the failed
    incoming commands.
    
    The fix -
    
    Errors that can happen while queueing chunks are carried upwards
    to the main mapping function and it now returns DM_MAPIO_REQUEUE
    for any incoming requests that can not be properly queued.
    
    Error logging/debug messages are added where needed.

    dm zoned: improve error handling in reclaim
    
    commit b234c6d7a703661b5045c5bf569b7c99d2edbf88 upstream.
    
    There are several places in reclaim code where errors are not
    propagated to the main function, dmz_reclaim(). This function
    is responsible for unlocking zones that might be still locked
    at the end of any failed reclaim iterations. As the result,
    some device zones may be left permanently locked for reclaim,
    degrading target's capability to reclaim zones.
    
    This patch fixes these issues as follows -
    
    Make sure that dmz_reclaim_buf(), dmz_reclaim_seq_data() and
    dmz_reclaim_rnd_data() return error codes to the caller.
    
    dmz_reclaim() function is renamed to dmz_do_reclaim() to avoid
    clashing with "struct dmz_reclaim" and is modified to return the
    error to the caller.
    
    dmz_get_zone_for_reclaim() now returns an error instead of NULL
    pointer and reclaim code checks for that error.
    
    Error logging/debug messages are added where necessary.

    dm table: fix invalid memory accesses with too high sector number
    
    commit 1cfd5d3399e87167b7f9157ef99daa0e959f395d upstream.
    
    If the sector number is too high, dm_table_find_target() should return a
    pointer to a zeroed dm_target structure (the caller should test it with
    dm_target_is_valid).
    
    However, for some table sizes, the code in dm_table_find_target() that
    performs btree lookup will access out of bound memory structures.
    
    Fix this bug by testing the sector number at the beginning of
    dm_table_find_target(). Also, add an "inline" keyword to the function
    dm_table_get_size() because this is a hot path.

    dm integrity: fix a crash due to BUG_ON in __journal_read_write()
    
    commit 5729b6e5a1bcb0bbc28abe82d749c7392f66d2c7 upstream.
    
    Fix a crash that was introduced by the commit 724376a04d1a. The crash is
    reported here: https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/issues/468
    
    When reading from the integrity device, the function
    dm_integrity_map_continue calls find_journal_node to find out if the
    location to read is present in the journal. Then, it calculates how many
    sectors are consecutively stored in the journal. Then, it locks the range
    with add_new_range and wait_and_add_new_range.
    
    The problem is that during wait_and_add_new_range, we hold no locks (we
    don't hold ic->endio_wait.lock and we don't hold a range lock), so the
    journal may change arbitrarily while wait_and_add_new_range sleeps.
    
    The code then goes to __journal_read_write and hits
    BUG_ON(journal_entry_get_sector(je) != logical_sector); because the
    journal has changed.
    
    In order to fix this bug, we need to re-check the journal location after
    wait_and_add_new_range. We restrict the length to one block in order to
    not complicate the code too much.

    commit e4f9d6013820d1eba1432d51dd1c5795759aa77f upstream.
    
    When btree_split_beneath() splits a node to two new children, it will
    allocate two blocks: left and right.  If right block's allocation
    failed, the left block will be unlocked and marked dirty.  If this
    happened, the left block'ss content is zero, because it wasn't
    initialized with the btree struct before the attempot to allocate the
    right block.  Upon return, when flushing the left block to disk, the
    validator will fail when check this block.  Then a BUG_ON is raised.
    
    Fix this by completely initializing the left block before allocating and
    initializing the right block.

    dm kcopyd: always complete failed jobs
    
    commit d1fef41465f0e8cae0693fb184caa6bfafb6cd16 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a problem in dm-kcopyd that may leave jobs in
    complete queue indefinitely in the event of backing storage failure.
    
    This behavior has been observed while running 100% write file fio
    workload against an XFS volume created on top of a dm-zoned target
    device. If the underlying storage of dm-zoned goes to offline state
    under I/O, kcopyd sometimes never issues the end copy callback and
    dm-zoned reclaim work hangs indefinitely waiting for that completion.
    
    This behavior was traced down to the error handling code in
    process_jobs() function that places the failed job to complete_jobs
    queue, but doesn't wake up the job handler. In case of backing device
    failure, all outstanding jobs may end up going to complete_jobs queue
    via this code path and then stay there forever because there are no
    more successful I/O jobs to wake up the job handler.
    
    This patch adds a wake() call to always wake up kcopyd job wait queue
    for all I/O jobs that fail before dm_io() gets called for that job.
    
    The patch also sets the write error status in all sub jobs that are
    failed because their master job has failed.

    Recent gcc compilers (gcc 9.1) generate warnings about an out of bounds

    generated a couple of warnings on x86_64 builds in sanitize_boot_params().

    that are intended to be preserved, and zeroing all the rest.

    x86/CPU/AMD: Clear RDRAND CPUID bit on AMD family 15h/16h
    
    commit c49a0a80137c7ca7d6ced4c812c9e07a949f6f24 upstream.
    
    There have been reports of RDRAND issues after resuming from suspend on
    some AMD family 15h and family 16h systems. This issue stems from a BIOS
    not performing the proper steps during resume to ensure RDRAND continues
    to function properly.
    
    RDRAND support is indicated by CPUID Fn00000001_ECX[30]. This bit can be
    reset by clearing MSR C001_1004[62]. Any software that checks for RDRAND
    support using CPUID, including the kernel, will believe that RDRAND is
    not supported.
    
    Update the CPU initialization to clear the RDRAND CPUID bit for any family
    15h and 16h processor that supports RDRAND. If it is known that the family
    15h or family 16h system does not have an RDRAND resume issue or that the
    system will not be placed in suspend, the "rdrand=force" kernel parameter
    can be used to stop the clearing of the RDRAND CPUID bit.
    
    Additionally, update the suspend and resume path to save and restore the
    MSR C001_1004 value to ensure that the RDRAND CPUID setting remains in
    place after resuming from suspend.
    
    Note, that clearing the RDRAND CPUID bit does not prevent a processor
    that normally supports the RDRAND instruction from executing it. So any
    code that determined the support based on family and model won't #UD.

    x86/apic: Handle missing global clockevent gracefully
    
    commit f897e60a12f0b9146357780d317879bce2a877dc upstream.
    
    Some newer machines do not advertise legacy timers. The kernel can handle
    that situation if the TSC and the CPU frequency are enumerated by CPUID or
    MSRs and the CPU supports TSC deadline timer. If the CPU does not support
    TSC deadline timer the local APIC timer frequency has to be known as well.
    
    Some Ryzens machines do not advertize legacy timers, but there is no
    reliable way to determine the bus frequency which feeds the local APIC
    timer when the machine allows overclocking of that frequency.
    
    As there is no legacy timer the local APIC timer calibration crashes due to
    a NULL pointer dereference when accessing the not installed global clock
    event device.
    
    Switch the calibration loop to a non interrupt based one, which polls
    either TSC (if frequency is known) or jiffies. The latter requires a global
    clockevent. As the machines which do not have a global clockevent installed
    have a known TSC frequency this is a non issue. For older machines where
    TSC frequency is not known, there is no known case where the legacy timers
    do not exist as that would have been reported long ago.

    x86/retpoline: Don't clobber RFLAGS during CALL_NOSPEC on i386
    
    commit b63f20a778c88b6a04458ed6ffc69da953d3a109 upstream.
    
    Use 'lea' instead of 'add' when adjusting %rsp in CALL_NOSPEC so as to
    avoid clobbering flags.
    
    KVM's emulator makes indirect calls into a jump table of sorts, where
    the destination of the CALL_NOSPEC is a small blob of code that performs
    fast emulation by executing the target instruction with fixed operands.
    
      adcb_al_dl:
         0x000339f8 <+0>:   adc    %dl,%al
         0x000339fa <+2>:   ret
    
    A major motiviation for doing fast emulation is to leverage the CPU to
    handle consumption and manipulation of arithmetic flags, i.e. RFLAGS is
    both an input and output to the target of CALL_NOSPEC.  Clobbering flags
    results in all sorts of incorrect emulation, e.g. Jcc instructions often
    take the wrong path.  Sans the nops...
    
      asm("push %[flags]; popf; " CALL_NOSPEC " ; pushf; pop %[flags]\n"
         0x0003595a <+58>:  mov    0xc0(%ebx),%eax
         0x00035960 <+64>:  mov    0x60(%ebx),%edx
         0x00035963 <+67>:  mov    0x90(%ebx),%ecx
         0x00035969 <+73>:  push   %edi
         0x0003596a <+74>:  popf
         0x0003596b <+75>:  call   *%esi
         0x000359a0 <+128>: pushf
         0x000359a1 <+129>: pop    %edi
         0x000359a2 <+130>: mov    %eax,0xc0(%ebx)
         0x000359b1 <+145>: mov    %edx,0x60(%ebx)
    
      ctxt->eflags = (ctxt->eflags & ~EFLAGS_MASK) | (flags & EFLAGS_MASK);
         0x000359a8 <+136>: mov    -0x10(%ebp),%eax
         0x000359ab <+139>: and    $0x8d5,%edi
         0x000359b4 <+148>: and    $0xfffff72a,%eax
         0x000359b9 <+153>: or     %eax,%edi
         0x000359bd <+157>: mov    %edi,0x4(%ebx)
    
    For the most part this has gone unnoticed as emulation of guest code
    that can trigger fast emulation is effectively limited to MMIO when
    running on modern hardware, and MMIO is rarely, if ever, accessed by
    instructions that affect or consume flags.
    
    Breakage is almost instantaneous when running with unrestricted guest
    disabled, in which case KVM must emulate all instructions when the guest
    has invalid state, e.g. when the guest is in Big Real Mode during early
    BIOS.

    gpiolib: never report open-drain/source lines as 'input' to user-space
    
    commit 2c60e6b5c9241b24b8b523fefd3e44fb85622cda upstream.
    
    If the driver doesn't support open-drain/source config options, we
    emulate this behavior when setting the direction by calling
    gpiod_direction_input() if the default value is 0 (open-source) or
    1 (open-drain), thus not actively driving the line in those cases.
    
    This however clears the FLAG_IS_OUT bit for the GPIO line descriptor
    and makes the LINEINFO ioctl() incorrectly report this line's mode as
    'input' to user-space.
    
    This commit modifies the ioctl() to always set the GPIOLINE_FLAG_IS_OUT
    bit in the lineinfo structure's flags field. Since it's impossible to
    use the input mode and open-drain/source options at the same time, we
    can be sure the reported information will be correct.

    drm/nouveau: Don't retry infinitely when receiving no data on i2c over AUX
    
    commit c358ebf59634f06d8ed176da651ec150df3c8686 upstream.
    
    While I had thought I had fixed this issue in:
    
    commit 342406e4fbba ("drm/nouveau/i2c: Disable i2c bus access after
    ->fini()")
    
    It turns out that while I did fix the error messages I was seeing on my
    P50 when trying to access i2c busses with the GPU in runtime suspend, I
    accidentally had missed one important detail that was mentioned on the
    bug report this commit was supposed to fix: that the CPU would only lock
    up when trying to access i2c busses _on connected devices_ _while the
    GPU is not in runtime suspend_. Whoops. That definitely explains why I
    was not able to get my machine to hang with i2c bus interactions until
    now, as plugging my P50 into it's dock with an HDMI monitor connected
    allowed me to finally reproduce this locally.
    
    Now that I have managed to reproduce this issue properly, it looks like
    the problem is much simpler then it looks. It turns out that some
    connected devices, such as MST laptop docks, will actually ACK i2c reads
    even if no data was actually read:
    
    [  275.063043] nouveau 0000:01:00.0: i2c: aux 000a: 1: 0000004c 1
    [  275.063447] nouveau 0000:01:00.0: i2c: aux 000a: 00 01101000 10040000
    [  275.063759] nouveau 0000:01:00.0: i2c: aux 000a: rd 00000001
    [  275.064024] nouveau 0000:01:00.0: i2c: aux 000a: rd 00000000
    [  275.064285] nouveau 0000:01:00.0: i2c: aux 000a: rd 00000000
    [  275.064594] nouveau 0000:01:00.0: i2c: aux 000a: rd 00000000
    
    Because we don't handle the situation of i2c ack without any data, we
    end up entering an infinite loop in nvkm_i2c_aux_i2c_xfer() since the
    value of cnt always remains at 0. This finally properly explains how
    this could result in a CPU hang like the ones observed in the
    aforementioned commit.
    
    So, fix this by retrying transactions if no data is written or received,
    and give up and fail the transaction if we continue to not write or
    receive any data after 32 retries.

    libceph: fix PG split vs OSD (re)connect race
    
    commit a561372405cf6bc6f14239b3a9e57bb39f2788b0 upstream.
    
    We can't rely on ->peer_features in calc_target() because it may be
    called both when the OSD session is established and open and when it's
    not.  ->peer_features is not valid unless the OSD session is open.  If
    this happens on a PG split (pg_num increase), that could mean we don't
    resend a request that should have been resent, hanging the client
    indefinitely.
    
    In userspace this was fixed by looking at require_osd_release and
    get_xinfo[osd].features fields of the osdmap.  However these fields
    belong to the OSD section of the osdmap, which the kernel doesn't
    decode (only the client section is decoded).
    
    Instead, let's drop this feature check.  It effectively checks for
    luminous, so only pre-luminous OSDs would be affected in that on a PG
    split the kernel might resend a request that should not have been
    resent.  Duplicates can occur in other scenarios, so both sides should
    already be prepared for them: see dup/replay logic on the OSD side and
    retry_attempt check on the client side.

    Revert "dm bufio: fix deadlock with loop device"
    
    commit cf3591ef832915892f2499b7e54b51d4c578b28c upstream.
    
    Revert the commit bd293d071ffe65e645b4d8104f9d8fe15ea13862. The proper
    fix has been made available with commit d0a255e795ab ("loop: set
    PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO for the worker thread").
    
    Note that the fix offered by commit bd293d071ffe doesn't really prevent
    the deadlock from occuring - if we look at the stacktrace reported by
    Junxiao Bi, we see that it hangs in bit_wait_io and not on the mutex -
    i.e. it has already successfully taken the mutex. Changing the mutex
    from mutex_lock to mutex_trylock won't help with deadlocks that happen
    afterwards.

    HID: wacom: Correct distance scale for 2nd-gen Intuos devices
    
    commit b72fb1dcd2ea9d29417711cb302cef3006fa8d5a upstream.
    
    Distance values reported by 2nd-gen Intuos tablets are on an inverted
    scale (0 == far, 63 == near). We need to change them over to a normal
    scale before reporting to userspace or else userspace drivers and
    applications can get confused.

    KVM: arm: Don't write junk to CP15 registers on reset
    
    [ Upstream commit c69509c70aa45a8c4954c88c629a64acf4ee4a36 ]
    
    At the moment, the way we reset CP15 registers is mildly insane:
    We write junk to them, call the reset functions, and then check that
    we have something else in them.
    
    The "fun" thing is that this can happen while the guest is running
    (PSCI, for example). If anything in KVM has to evaluate the state
    of a CP15 register while junk is in there, bad thing may happen.
    
    Let's stop doing that. Instead, we track that we have called a
    reset function for that register, and assume that the reset
    function has done something.
    
    In the end, the very need of this reset check is pretty dubious,
    as it doesn't check everything (a lot of the CP15 reg leave outside
    of the cp15_regs[] array). It may well be axed in the near future.

    perf pmu-events: Fix missing "cpu_clk_unhalted.core" event
    
    [ Upstream commit 8e6e5bea2e34c61291d00cb3f47560341aa84bc3 ]
    
    The events defined in pmu-events JSON are parsed and added into perf
    tool. For fixed counters, we handle the encodings between JSON and perf
    by using a static array fixed[].
    
    But the fixed[] has missed an important event "cpu_clk_unhalted.core".
    
    For example, on the Tremont platform,
    
      [root@localhost ~]# perf stat -e cpu_clk_unhalted.core -a
      event syntax error: 'cpu_clk_unhalted.core'
                           \___ parser error
    
    With this patch, the event cpu_clk_unhalted.core can be parsed.
    
      [root@localhost perf]# ./perf stat -e cpu_clk_unhalted.core -a -vvv

    [ Upstream commit cf30ae726c011e0372fd4c2d588466c8b50a8907 ]
    
    The buffer containing the string used to set cpumask is overwritten at
    the end of the string later in cpu_map__snprint_mask due to not enough
    memory space, when there is only one cpu.
    
    And thus causes the following failure:
    
      $ perf ftrace ls

    libata: have ata_scsi_rw_xlat() fail invalid passthrough requests
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d7271501720038381d45fb3dcbe4831228fc8cc ]
    
    For passthrough requests, libata-scsi takes what the user passes in
    as gospel. This can be problematic if the user fills in the CDB
    incorrectly. One example of that is in request sizes. For read/write
    commands, the CDB contains fields describing the transfer length of
    the request. These should match with the SG_IO header fields, but
    libata-scsi currently does no validation of that.
    
    Check that the number of blocks in the CDB for passthrough requests
    matches what was mapped into the request. If the CDB asks for more
    data then the validated SG_IO header fields, error it.

    [ Upstream commit 24350fdadbdec780406a1ef988e6cd3875e374a8 ]
    
    Perf relies on _etext and _stext symbols being one of 't', 'T', 'v' or
    'V'. Put them into .text section to guarantee that.
    
    Also moves padding to page boundary inside .text which has an effect that
    .text section is now padded with nops rather than 0's, which apparently
    has been the initial intention for specifying 0x0700 fill expression.

    When a reconnect happens in the middle of processing a compound chain
    the code leaks a buffer from the memory pool. Fix this by properly
    checking for a return code and freeing buffers in case of error.
    
    Also maintain a buf variable to be equal to either smallbuf or bigbuf
    depending on a response buffer size while parsing a chain and when
    returning to the caller.

    drm/rockchip: Suspend DP late
    
    [ Upstream commit f7ccbed656f78212593ca965d9a8f34bf24e0aab ]
    
    In commit fe64ba5c6323 ("drm/rockchip: Resume DP early") we moved
    resume to be early but left suspend at its normal time.  This seems
    like it could be OK, but casues problems if a suspend gets interrupted
    partway through.  The OS only balances matching suspend/resume levels.
    ...so if suspend was called then resume will be called.  If suspend
    late was called then resume early will be called.  ...but if suspend
    was called resume early might not get called.  This leads to an
    unbalance in the clock enables / disables.
    
    Lets take the simple fix and just move suspend to be late to match.
    This makes the PM core take proper care in keeping things balanced.

    HID: input: fix a4tech horizontal wheel custom usage
    
    [ Upstream commit 1c703b53e5bfb5c2205c30f0fb157ce271fd42fb ]
    
    Some a4tech mice use the 'GenericDesktop.00b8' usage to inform whether
    the previous wheel report was horizontal or vertical. Before
    c01908a14bf73 ("HID: input: add mapping for "Toggle Display" key") this
    usage was being mapped to 'Relative.Misc'. After the patch it's simply
    ignored (usage->type == 0 & usage->code == 0). Which ultimately makes
    hid-a4tech ignore the WHEEL/HWHEEL selection event, as it has no
    usage->type.
    
    We shouldn't rely on a mapping for that usage as it's nonstandard and
    doesn't really map to an input event. So we bypass the mapping and make
    sure the custom event handling properly handles both reports.

    The Saitek X52 joystick has a pair of axes that are originally
    (by the Windows driver) used as mouse pointer controls. The corresponding
    usage->hid values are 0x50024 and 0x50026. Thus they are handled
    as unknown axes and both get mapped to ABS_MISC. The quirk makes
    the second axis to be mapped to ABS_MISC1 and thus made available
    separately.

    NFS: Fix regression whereby fscache errors are appearing on 'nofsc' mounts
    
    [ Upstream commit dea1bb35c5f35e0577cfc61f79261d80b8715221 ]
    
    People are reporing seeing fscache errors being reported concerning
    duplicate cookies even in cases where they are not setting up fscache
    at all. The rule needs to be that if fscache is not enabled, then it
    should have no side effects at all.
    
    To ensure this is the case, we disable fscache completely on all superblocks
    for which the 'fsc' mount option was not set. In order to avoid issues
    with '-oremount', we also disable the ability to turn fscache on via
    remount.

    This happens when the cpu0 is not part of node0, which is the benchmark
    assumption and we can see that's not the case for some powerpc servers.

    Thus, a possible null-pointer dereference may occur.
    
    To fix this bug, led_trigger_event(&phy->last_triggered->trigger,
    LED_OFF) is called when phy->last_triggered is not NULL.
    
    This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by
    the OSLAB group in Tsinghua University.

    isdn: hfcsusb: Fix mISDN driver crash caused by transfer buffer on the stack
    
    [ Upstream commit d8a1de3d5bb881507602bc02e004904828f88711 ]
    
    Since linux 4.9 it is not possible to use buffers on the stack for DMA transfers.
    
    During usb probe the driver crashes with "transfer buffer is on stack" message.
    
    This fix k-allocates a buffer to be used on "read_reg_atomic", which is a macro
    that calls "usb_control_msg" under the hood.

    rxrpc: Fix the lack of notification when sendmsg() fails on a DATA packet
    
    [ Upstream commit c69565ee6681e151e2bb80502930a16e04b553d1 ]
    
    Fix the fact that a notification isn't sent to the recvmsg side to indicate
    a call failed when sendmsg() fails to transmit a DATA packet with the error
    ENETUNREACH, EHOSTUNREACH or ECONNREFUSED.
    
    Without this notification, the afs client just sits there waiting for the
    call to complete in some manner (which it's not now going to do), which
    also pins the rxrpc call in place.
    
    This can be seen if the client has a scope-level IPv6 address, but not a
    global-level IPv6 address, and we try and transmit an operation to a
    server's IPv6 address.
    
    Looking in /proc/net/rxrpc/calls shows completed calls just sat there with
    an abort code of RX_USER_ABORT and an error code of -ENETUNREACH.

    rxrpc: Fix potential deadlock
    
    [ Upstream commit 60034d3d146b11922ab1db613bce062dddc0327a ]
    
    There is a potential deadlock in rxrpc_peer_keepalive_dispatch() whereby
    rxrpc_put_peer() is called with the peer_hash_lock held, but if it reduces
    the peer's refcount to 0, rxrpc_put_peer() calls __rxrpc_put_peer() - which
    the tries to take the already held lock.
    
    Fix this by providing a version of rxrpc_put_peer() that can be called in
    situations where the lock is already held.
    
    The bug may produce the following lockdep report:

    netfilter: ipset: Copy the right MAC address in bitmap:ip,mac and hash:ip,mac sets
    
    [ Upstream commit 1b4a75108d5bc153daf965d334e77e8e94534f96 ]
    
    In commit 8cc4ccf58379 ("ipset: Allow matching on destination MAC address
    for mac and ipmac sets"), ipset.git commit 1543514c46a7, I added to the
    KADT functions for sets matching on MAC addreses the copy of source or
    destination MAC address depending on the configured match.
    
    This was done correctly for hash:mac, but for hash:ip,mac and
    bitmap:ip,mac, copying and pasting the same code block presents an
    obvious problem: in these two set types, the MAC address is the second
    dimension, not the first one, and we are actually selecting the MAC
    address depending on whether the first dimension (IP address) specifies
    source or destination.
    
    Fix this by checking for the IPSET_DIM_TWO_SRC flag in option flags.
    
    This way, mixing source and destination matches for the two dimensions
    of ip,mac set types works as expected. With this setup:
    
      ip netns add A
      ip link add veth1 type veth peer name veth2 netns A
      ip addr add 192.0.2.1/24 dev veth1
      ip -net A addr add 192.0.2.2/24 dev veth2
      ip link set veth1 up
      ip -net A link set veth2 up
    
      dst=$(ip netns exec A cat /sys/class/net/veth2/address)
    
      ip netns exec A ipset create test_bitmap bitmap:ip,mac range 192.0.0.0/16
      ip netns exec A ipset add test_bitmap 192.0.2.1,${dst}
      ip netns exec A iptables -A INPUT -m set ! --match-set test_bitmap src,dst -j DROP
    
      ip netns exec A ipset create test_hash hash:ip,mac
      ip netns exec A ipset add test_hash 192.0.2.1,${dst}
      ip netns exec A iptables -A INPUT -m set ! --match-set test_hash src,dst -j DROP
    
    ipset correctly matches a test packet:
    
      # ping -c1 192.0.2.2 >/dev/null
      # echo $?
      0

    Thus, possible null-pointer dereferences may occur.

    [ Upstream commit 1e112c35e3c96db7c8ca6ddaa96574f00c06e7db ]
    
    The slot_width is a property for the bus while the constraint for
    SNDRV_PCM_HW_PARAM_SAMPLE_BITS is for the in memory format.
    
    Applying slot_width constraint to sample_bits works most of the time, but
    it will blacklist valid formats in some cases.
    
    With slot_width 24 we can support S24_3LE and S24_LE formats as they both
    look the same on the bus, but a a 24 constraint on sample_bits would not
    allow S24_LE as it is stored in 32bits in memory.
    
    Implement a simple hw_rule function to allow all formats which require less
    or equal number of bits on the bus as slot_width (if configured).

    Revert "ASoC: rockchip: i2s: Support mono capture"
    
    Previous discussion in
    
    https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10147153/
    
    explains the issue of the patch.
    While device is configured as 1-ch, hardware is still
    generating a 2-ch stream.
    When user space reads the data and assumes it is a 1-ch stream,
    the rate will be slower by 2x.
    
    Revert the change so 1-ch is not supported.
    User space can selectively take one channel data out of two channel
    if 1-ch is preferred.
    Currently, both channels record identical data.

    CONFIG_CAN_LEDS is deprecated. When trying to use the generic netdev
    trigger as suggested, there's a small inconsistency with the link
    property: The LED is on initially, stays on when the device is brought
    up, and then turns off (as expected) when the device is brought down.
    
    Make sure the LED always reflects the state of the CAN device.

    [ Upstream commit 1be79d89b7ae96e004911bd228ce8c2b5cc6415f ]
    
    The TC filters used in the test do not work with veth devices because the
    outer Ethertype is 802.1Q and not IPv4. The test passes with mlxsw
    netdevs since the hardware always looks at "The first Ethertype that
    does not point to either: VLAN, CNTAG or configurable Ethertype".
    
    Fix this by matching on the VLAN ID instead, but on the ingress side.
    The reason why this is not performed at egress is explained in the
    commit cited below.

    bonding: Force slave speed check after link state recovery for 802.3ad
    
    [ Upstream commit 12185dfe44360f814ac4ead9d22ad2af7511b2e9 ]
    
    The following scenario was encountered during testing of logical
    partition mobility on pseries partitions with bonded ibmvnic
    adapters in LACP mode.
    
    1. Driver receives a signal that the device has been
       swapped, and it needs to reset to initialize the new
       device.
    
    2. Driver reports loss of carrier and begins initialization.
    
    3. Bonding driver receives NETDEV_CHANGE notifier and checks
       the slave's current speed and duplex settings. Because these
       are unknown at the time, the bond sets its link state to
       BOND_LINK_FAIL and handles the speed update, clearing
       AD_PORT_LACP_ENABLE.
    
    4. Driver finishes recovery and reports that the carrier is on.
    
    5. Bond receives a new notification and checks the speed again.
       The speeds are valid but miimon has not altered the link
       state yet.  AD_PORT_LACP_ENABLE remains off.
    
    Because the slave's link state is still BOND_LINK_FAIL,
    no further port checks are made when it recovers. Though
    the slave devices are operational and have valid speed
    and duplex settings, the bond will not send LACPDU's. The
    simplest fix I can see is to force another speed check
    in bond_miimon_commit. This way the bond will update
    AD_PORT_LACP_ENABLE if needed when transitioning from
    BOND_LINK_FAIL to BOND_LINK_UP.

    [ Upstream commit c8eee4135a456bc031d67cadc454e76880d1afd8 ]
    
    "sendmsg6: rewrite IP & port (C)" fails on s390, because the code in
    sendmsg_v6_prog() assumes that (ctx->user_ip6[0] & 0xFFFF) refers to
    leading IPv6 address digits, which is not the case on big-endian
    machines.
    
    Since checking bitwise operations doesn't seem to be the point of the
    test, replace two short comparisons with a single int comparison.

    ASoC: dapm: Fix handling of custom_stop_condition on DAPM graph walks
    
    [ Upstream commit 8dd26dff00c0636b1d8621acaeef3f6f3a39dd77 ]
    
    DPCM uses snd_soc_dapm_dai_get_connected_widgets to build a
    list of the widgets connected to a specific front end DAI so it
    can search through this list for available back end DAIs. The
    custom_stop_condition was added to is_connected_ep to facilitate this
    list not containing more widgets than is necessary. Doing so both
    speeds up the DPCM handling as less widgets need to be searched and
    avoids issues with CODEC to CODEC links as these would be confused
    with back end DAIs if they appeared in the list of available widgets.
    
    custom_stop_condition was implemented by aborting the graph walk
    when the condition is triggered, however there is an issue with this
    approach. Whilst walking the graph is_connected_ep should update the
    endpoints cache on each widget, if the walk is aborted the number
    of attached end points is unknown for that sub-graph. When the stop
    condition triggered, the original patch ignored the triggering widget
    and returned zero connected end points; a later patch updated this
    to set the triggering widget's cache to 1 and return that. Both of
    these approaches result in inaccurate values being stored in various
    end point caches as the values propagate back through the graph,
    which can result in later issues with widgets powering/not powering
    unexpectedly.
    
    As the original goal was to reduce the size of the widget list passed
    to the DPCM code, the simplest solution is to limit the functionality
    of the custom_stop_condition to the widget list. This means the rest
    of the graph will still be processed resulting in correct end point
    caches, but only widgets up to the stop condition will be added to the
    returned widget list.

    netfilter: ebtables: fix a memory leak bug in compat
    
    [ Upstream commit 15a78ba1844a8e052c1226f930133de4cef4e7ad ]
    
    In compat_do_replace(), a temporary buffer is allocated through vmalloc()
    to hold entries copied from the user space. The buffer address is firstly
    saved to 'newinfo->entries', and later on assigned to 'entries_tmp'. Then
    the entries in this temporary buffer is copied to the internal kernel
    structure through compat_copy_entries(). If this copy process fails,
    compat_do_replace() should be terminated. However, the allocated temporary
    buffer is not freed on this path, leading to a memory leak.
    
    To fix the bug, free the buffer before returning from compat_do_replace().
