    kernel/sysctl.c: fix out-of-bounds access when setting file-max
    
    commit 9002b21465fa4d829edfc94a5a441005cffaa972 upstream.
    
    Commit 32a5ad9c2285 ("sysctl: handle overflow for file-max") hooked up
    min/max values for the file-max sysctl parameter via the .extra1 and
    .extra2 fields in the corresponding struct ctl_table entry.
    
    Unfortunately, the minimum value points at the global 'zero' variable,
    which is an int.  This results in a KASAN splat when accessed as a long
    by proc_doulongvec_minmax on 64-bit architectures:

    Fix the splat by introducing a unsigned long 'zero_ul' and using that
    instead.

    i2c-hid: properly terminate i2c_hid_dmi_desc_override_table[] array
    
    commit b59dfdaef173677b0b7e10f375226c0a1114fd20 upstream.
    
    Commit 9ee3e06610fd ("HID: i2c-hid: override HID descriptors for certain
    devices") added a new dmi_system_id quirk table to override certain HID
    report descriptors for some systems that lack them.
    
    But the table wasn't properly terminated, causing the dmi matching to
    walk off into la-la-land, and starting to treat random data as dmi
    descriptor pointers, causing boot-time oopses if you were at all
    unlucky.
    
    Terminate the array.
    
    We really should have some way to just statically check that arrays that
    should be terminated by an empty entry actually are so.  But the HID
    people really should have caught this themselves, rather than have me
    deal with an oops during the merge window.  Tssk, tssk.

    xfs: hold xfs_buf locked between shortform->leaf conversion and the addition of an attribute
    
    commit 6e643cd094de3bd0f97edcc1db0089afa24d909f upstream.
    
    The new attribute leaf buffer is not held locked across the transaction
    roll between the shortform->leaf modification and the addition of the
    new entry.  As a result, the attribute buffer modification being made is
    not atomic from an operational perspective.  Hence the AIL push can grab
    it in the transient state of "just created" after the initial
    transaction is rolled, because the buffer has been released.  This leads
    to xfs_attr3_leaf_verify() asserting that hdr.count is zero, treating
    this as in-memory corruption, and shutting down the filesystem.
    
    Darrick ported the original patch to 4.15 and reworked it use the
    xfs_defer_bjoin helper and hold/join the buffer correctly across the
    second transaction roll.

    commit b7b2846fe26f2c0d7f317c874a13d3ecf22670ff upstream.
    
    In certain cases, defer_ops callers will lock a buffer and want to hold
    the lock across transaction rolls.  Similar to ijoined inodes, we want
    to dirty & join the buffer with each transaction roll in defer_finish so
    that afterwards the caller still owns the buffer lock and we haven't
    inadvertently pinned the log.

    iomap: report collisions between directio and buffered writes to userspace
    
    commit 5a9d929d6e13278df62bd9e3d3ceae8c87ad1eea upstream.
    
    If two programs simultaneously try to write to the same part of a file
    via direct IO and buffered IO, there's a chance that the post-diowrite
    pagecache invalidation will fail on the dirty page.  When this happens,
    the dio write succeeded, which means that the page cache is no longer
    coherent with the disk!
    
    Programs are not supposed to mix IO types and this is a clear case of
    data corruption, so store an EIO which will be reflected to userspace
    during the next fsync.  Replace the WARN_ON with a ratelimited pr_crit
    so that the developers have /some/ kind of breadcrumb to track down the
    offending program(s) and file(s) involved.

    So that we reduce the difference of tools/include/linux/bitops.h to the
    original kernel file, include/linux/bitops.h, trying to remove the need
    to define BITS_PER_LONG, to avoid clashes with asm/bitsperlong.h.
    
    And the things removed from tools/include/linux/bitops.h are really in
    linux/bits.h, so that we can have a copy and then
    tools/perf/check_headers.sh will tell us when new stuff gets added to
    linux/bits.h so that we can check if it is useful and if any adjustment
    needs to be done to the tools/{include,arch}/ copies.

    ALSA: info: Fix racy addition/deletion of nodes
    
    commit 8c2f870890fd28e023b0fcf49dcee333f2c8bad7 upstream.
    
    The ALSA proc helper manages the child nodes in a linked list, but its
    addition and deletion is done without any lock.  This leads to a
    corruption if they are operated concurrently.  Usually this isn't a
    problem because the proc entries are added sequentially in the driver
    probe procedure itself.  But the card registrations are done often
    asynchronously, and the crash could be actually reproduced with
    syzkaller.
    
    This patch papers over it by protecting the link addition and deletion
    with the parent's mutex.  There is "access" mutex that is used for the
    file access, and this can be reused for this purpose as well.

    Commit 58bc4c34d249 ("mm/vmstat.c: skip NR_TLB_REMOTE_FLUSH* properly")
    depends on skipping vmstat entries with empty name introduced in
    7aaf77272358 ("mm: don't show nr_indirectly_reclaimable in
    /proc/vmstat") but reverted in b29940c1abd7 ("mm: rename and change
    semantics of nr_indirectly_reclaimable_bytes").
    
    So skipping no longer works and /proc/vmstat has misformatted lines " 0".
    
    This patch simply shows debug counters "nr_tlb_remote_*" for UP.

    sched/fair: Limit sched_cfs_period_timer() loop to avoid hard lockup
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e8e19226398db8265a8e675fcc0118b9e80c9e8 ]
    
    With extremely short cfs_period_us setting on a parent task group with a large
    number of children the for loop in sched_cfs_period_timer() can run until the
    watchdog fires. There is no guarantee that the call to hrtimer_forward_now()
    will ever return 0.  The large number of children can make
    do_sched_cfs_period_timer() take longer than the period.
    
     NMI watchdog: Watchdog detected hard LOCKUP on cpu 24
     RIP: 0010:tg_nop+0x0/0x10
      <IRQ>
      walk_tg_tree_from+0x29/0xb0

      </IRQ>
    
    To prevent this we add protection to the loop that detects when the loop has run
    too many times and scales the period and quota up, proportionally, so that the timer
    can complete before then next period expires.  This preserves the relative runtime
    quota while preventing the hard lockup.
    
    A warning is issued reporting this state and the new values.

    ipv6: remove dependency of nf_defrag_ipv6 on ipv6 module
    
    [ Upstream commit 70b095c84326640eeacfd69a411db8fc36e8ab1a ]
    
    IPV6=m
    DEFRAG_IPV6=m
    CONNTRACK=y yields:
    
    net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto.o: In function `nf_ct_netns_do_get':
    net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto.c:802: undefined reference to `nf_defrag_ipv6_enable'
    net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto.o:(.rodata+0x640): undefined reference to `nf_conntrack_l4proto_icmpv6'
    
    Setting DEFRAG_IPV6=y causes undefined references to ip6_rhash_params
    ip6_frag_init and ip6_expire_frag_queue so it would be needed to force
    IPV6=y too.
    
    This patch gets rid of the 'followup linker error' by removing
    the dependency of ipv6.ko symbols from netfilter ipv6 defrag.
    
    Shared code is placed into a header, then used from both.

    ipv6: frags: fix a lockdep false positive
    
    [ Upstream commit 415787d7799f4fccbe8d49cb0b8e5811be6b0389 ]
    
    lockdep does not know that the locks used by IPv4 defrag
    and IPv6 reassembly units are of different classes.
    
    It complains because of following chains :
    
    1) sch_direct_xmit()        (lock txq->_xmit_lock)
        dev_hard_start_xmit()
         xmit_one()
          dev_queue_xmit_nit()
           packet_rcv_fanout()
            ip_check_defrag()
             ip_defrag()
              spin_lock()     (lock frag queue spinlock)
    
    2) ip6_input_finish()
        ipv6_frag_rcv()       (lock frag queue spinlock)
         ip6_frag_queue()
          icmpv6_param_prob() (lock txq->_xmit_lock at some point)
    
    We could add lockdep annotations, but we also can make sure IPv6
    calls icmpv6_param_prob() only after the release of the frag queue spinlock,
    since this naturally makes frag queue spinlock a leaf in lock hierarchy.

    is not valid. Change the driver to handle the error in the same manner
    as a data CRC error, taking care to ensure that the data line reset is
    done for single or multi-block transfers, and it is done before
    unmapping DMA.

    commit 2f5fb19341883bb6e37da351bc3700489d8506a7 upstream.
    
    Mikhail reported a lockdep splat related to the AMD specific ssb_state
    lock:
    
      CPU0                       CPU1
      lock(&st->lock);
                                 local_irq_disable();
                                 lock(&(&sighand->siglock)->rlock);
                                 lock(&st->lock);
      <Interrupt>
         lock(&(&sighand->siglock)->rlock);
    
      *** DEADLOCK ***
    
    The connection between sighand->siglock and st->lock comes through seccomp,
    which takes st->lock while holding sighand->siglock.
    
    Make sure interrupts are disabled when __speculation_ctrl_update() is
    invoked via prctl() -> speculation_ctrl_update(). Add a lockdep assert to
    catch future offenders.

    commit 3fe3331bb285700ab2253dbb07f8e478fcea2f1b upstream.
    
    Family 17h differs from prior families by:
    
     - Does not support an L2 cache miss event
     - It has re-enumerated PMC counters for:
       - L2 cache references
       - front & back end stalled cycles
    
    So we add a new amd_f17h_perfmon_event_map[] so that the generic
    perf event names will resolve to the correct h/w events on
    family 17h and above processors.
    
    Reference sections 2.1.13.3.3 (stalls) and 2.1.13.3.6 (L2):

    mac80211: do not call driver wake_tx_queue op during reconfig
    
    commit 4856bfd230985e43e84c26473c91028ff0a533bd upstream.
    
    There are several scenarios in which mac80211 can call drv_wake_tx_queue
    after ieee80211_restart_hw has been called and has not yet completed.
    Driver private structs are considered uninitialized until mac80211 has
    uploaded the vifs, stations and keys again, so using private tx queue
    data during that time is not safe.
    
    The driver can also not rely on drv_reconfig_complete to figure out when
    it is safe to accept drv_wake_tx_queue calls again, because it is only

    rt2x00: do not increment sequence number while re-transmitting
    
    commit 746ba11f170603bf1eaade817553a6c2e9135bbe upstream.
    
    Currently rt2x00 devices retransmit the management frames with
    incremented sequence number if hardware is assigning the sequence.
    
    This is HW bug fixed already for non-QOS data frames, but it should
    be fixed for management frames except beacon.
    
    Without fix retransmitted frames have wrong SN:
    
     AlphaNet_e8:fb:36 Vivotek_52:31:51 Authentication, SN=1648, FN=0, Flags=........C Frame is not being retransmitted 1648 1
     AlphaNet_e8:fb:36 Vivotek_52:31:51 Authentication, SN=1649, FN=0, Flags=....R...C Frame is being retransmitted 1649 1
     AlphaNet_e8:fb:36 Vivotek_52:31:51 Authentication, SN=1650, FN=0, Flags=....R...C Frame is being retransmitted 1650 1
    
    With the fix SN stays correctly the same:
    
     88:6a:e3:e8:f9:a2 8c:f5:a3:88:76:87 Authentication, SN=1450, FN=0, Flags=........C

    kprobes: Fix error check when reusing optimized probes
    
    commit 5f843ed415581cfad4ef8fefe31c138a8346ca8a upstream.
    
    The following commit introduced a bug in one of our error paths:
    
      819319fc9346 ("kprobes: Return error if we fail to reuse kprobe instead of BUG_ON()")
    
    it missed to handle the return value of kprobe_optready() as
    error-value. In reality, the kprobe_optready() returns a bool
    result, so "true" case must be passed instead of 0.
    
    This causes some errors on kprobe boot-time selftests on ARM:
    
     [   ] Beginning kprobe tests...
     [   ] Probe ARM code
     [   ]     kprobe
     [   ]     kretprobe
     [   ] ARM instruction simulation
     [   ]     Check decoding tables
     [   ]     Run test cases
     [   ] FAIL: test_case_handler not run
     [   ] FAIL: Test andge r10, r11, r14, asr r7
     [   ] FAIL: Scenario 11
     ...
     [   ] FAIL: Scenario 7
     [   ] Total instruction simulation tests=1631, pass=1433 fail=198
     [   ] kprobe tests failed
    
    This can happen if an optimized probe is unregistered and next
    kprobe is registered on same address until the previous probe
    is not reclaimed.
    
    If this happens, a hidden aggregated probe may be kept in memory,
    and no new kprobe can probe same address. Also, in that case
    register_kprobe() will return "1" instead of minus error value,
    which can mislead caller logic.

    x86/kprobes: Verify stack frame on kretprobe
    
    commit 3ff9c075cc767b3060bdac12da72fc94dd7da1b8 upstream.
    
    Verify the stack frame pointer on kretprobe trampoline handler,
    If the stack frame pointer does not match, it skips the wrong
    entry and tries to find correct one.
    
    This can happen if user puts the kretprobe on the function
    which can be used in the path of ftrace user-function call.
    Such functions should not be probed, so this adds a warning
    message that reports which function should be blacklisted.

    arm64: futex: Restore oldval initialization to work around buggy compilers
    
    commit ff8acf929014b7f87315588e0daf8597c8aa9d1c upstream.
    
    Commit 045afc24124d ("arm64: futex: Fix FUTEX_WAKE_OP atomic ops with
    non-zero result value") removed oldval's zero initialization in
    arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser because it is not necessary. Unfortunately,
    Android's arm64 GCC 4.9.4 [1] does not agree:
    
    ../kernel/futex.c: In function 'do_futex':
    ../kernel/futex.c:1658:17: warning: 'oldval' may be used uninitialized
    in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
       return oldval == cmparg;
                     ^
    In file included from ../kernel/futex.c:73:0:
    ../arch/arm64/include/asm/futex.h:53:6: note: 'oldval' was declared here
      int oldval, ret, tmp;
          ^
    
    GCC fails to follow that when ret is non-zero, futex_atomic_op_inuser
    returns right away, avoiding the uninitialized use that it claims.
    Restoring the zero initialization works around this issue.

    crypto: x86/poly1305 - fix overflow during partial reduction
    
    commit 678cce4019d746da6c680c48ba9e6d417803e127 upstream.
    
    The x86_64 implementation of Poly1305 produces the wrong result on some
    inputs because poly1305_4block_avx2() incorrectly assumes that when
    partially reducing the accumulator, the bits carried from limb 'd4' to
    limb 'h0' fit in a 32-bit integer.  This is true for poly1305-generic
    which processes only one block at a time.  However, it's not true for
    the AVX2 implementation, which processes 4 blocks at a time and
    therefore can produce intermediate limbs about 4x larger.
    
    Fix it by making the relevant calculations use 64-bit arithmetic rather
    than 32-bit.  Note that most of the carries already used 64-bit
    arithmetic, but the d4 -> h0 carry was different for some reason.
    
    To be safe I also made the same change to the corresponding SSE2 code,
    though that only operates on 1 or 2 blocks at a time.  I don't think
    it's really needed for poly1305_block_sse2(), but it doesn't hurt
    because it's already x86_64 code.  It *might* be needed for
    poly1305_2block_sse2(), but overflows aren't easy to reproduce there.
    
    This bug was originally detected by my patches that improve testmgr to
    fuzz algorithms against their generic implementation.  But also add a
    test vector which reproduces it directly (in the AVX2 case).
    
    Fixes: b1ccc8f4b631 ("crypto: poly1305 - Add a four block AVX2 variant for x86_64")

    coredump: fix race condition between mmget_not_zero()/get_task_mm() and core dumping
    
    commit 04f5866e41fb70690e28397487d8bd8eea7d712a upstream.
    
    The core dumping code has always run without holding the mmap_sem for
    writing, despite that is the only way to ensure that the entire vma
    layout will not change from under it.  Only using some signal
    serialization on the processes belonging to the mm is not nearly enough.
    This was pointed out earlier.  For example in Hugh's post from Jul 2017:
    
      https://lkml.kernel.org/r/alpine.LSU.2.11.1707191716030.2055@eggly.anvils
    
      "Not strictly relevant here, but a related note: I was very surprised
       to discover, only quite recently, how handle_mm_fault() may be called
       without down_read(mmap_sem) - when core dumping. That seems a
       misguided optimization to me, which would also be nice to correct"
    
    In particular because the growsdown and growsup can move the
    vm_start/vm_end the various loops the core dump does around the vma will
    not be consistent if page faults can happen concurrently.
    
    Pretty much all users calling mmget_not_zero()/get_task_mm() and then
    taking the mmap_sem had the potential to introduce unexpected side
    effects in the core dumping code.
    
    Adding mmap_sem for writing around the ->core_dump invocation is a
    viable long term fix, but it requires removing all copy user and page
    faults and to replace them with get_dump_page() for all binary formats
    which is not suitable as a short term fix.
    
    For the time being this solution manually covers the places that can
    confuse the core dump either by altering the vma layout or the vma flags
    while it runs.  Once ->core_dump runs under mmap_sem for writing the
    function mmget_still_valid() can be dropped.
    
    Allowing mmap_sem protected sections to run in parallel with the
    coredump provides some minor parallelism advantage to the swapoff code
    (which seems to be safe enough by never mangling any vma field and can
    keep doing swapins in parallel to the core dumping) and to some other
    corner case.
    
    In order to facilitate the backporting I added "Fixes: 86039bd3b4e6"
    however the side effect of this same race condition in /proc/pid/mem
    should be reproducible since before 2.6.12-rc2 so I couldn't add any
    other "Fixes:" because there's no hash beyond the git genesis commit.
    
    Because find_extend_vma() is the only location outside of the process
    context that could modify the "mm" structures under mmap_sem for
    reading, by adding the mmget_still_valid() check to it, all other cases
    that take the mmap_sem for reading don't need the new check after
    mmget_not_zero()/get_task_mm().  The expand_stack() in page fault
    context also doesn't need the new check, because all tasks under core
    dumping are frozen.

    Revert "svm: Fix AVIC incomplete IPI emulation"
    
    commit 4a58038b9e420276157785afa0a0bbb4b9bc2265 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit bb218fbcfaaa3b115d4cd7a43c0ca164f3a96e57.
    
    As Oren Twaig pointed out the old discussion:
    
      https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8292231/
    
    that the change coud potentially cause an extra IPI to be sent to
    the destination vcpu because the AVIC hardware already set the IRR bit
    before the incomplete IPI #VMEXIT with id=1 (target vcpu is not running).
    Since writting to ICR and ICR2 will also set the IRR. If something triggers
    the destination vcpu to get scheduled before the emulation finishes, then
    this could result in an additional IPI.
    
    Also, the issue mentioned in the commit bb218fbcfaaa was misdiagnosed.

    failed. Since the upper layer code including the sg_io ioctl expects to
    receive any error status from result field of scsi_request, the error is
    silently ignored and this could cause data corruptions for some
    applications.

    ALSA: core: Fix card races between register and disconnect
    
    commit 2a3f7221acddfe1caa9ff09b3a8158c39b2fdeac upstream.
    
    There is a small race window in the card disconnection code that
    allows the registration of another card with the very same card id.
    This leads to a warning in procfs creation as caught by syzkaller.
    
    The problem is that we delete snd_cards and snd_cards_lock entries at
    the very beginning of the disconnection procedure.  This makes the
    slot available to be assigned for another card object while the
    disconnection procedure is being processed.  Then it becomes possible
    to issue a procfs registration with the existing file name although we
    check the conflict beforehand.
    
    The fix is simply to move the snd_cards and snd_cards_lock clearances
    at the end of the disconnection procedure.  The references to these
    entries are merely either from the global proc files like
    /proc/asound/cards or from the card registration / disconnection, so
    it should be fine to shift at the very end.

    commit b26e36b7ef36a8a3a147b1609b2505f8a4ecf511 upstream.
    
    We have two Dell laptops which have the codec 10ec0236 and 10ec0256
    respectively, the headset mic on them can't work, need to apply the
    quirk of ALC255_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE. So adding their pin
    configurations in the pin quirk table.

    staging: comedi: ni_usb6501: Fix possible double-free of ->usb_rx_buf
    
    commit af4b54a2e5ba18259ff9aac445bf546dd60d037e upstream.
    
    `ni6501_alloc_usb_buffers()` is called from `ni6501_auto_attach()` to
    allocate RX and TX buffers for USB transfers.  It allocates
    `devpriv->usb_rx_buf` followed by `devpriv->usb_tx_buf`.  If the
    allocation of `devpriv->usb_tx_buf` fails, it frees
    `devpriv->usb_rx_buf`, leaving the pointer set dangling, and returns an
    error.  Later, `ni6501_detach()` will be called from the core comedi
    module code to clean up.  `ni6501_detach()` also frees both
    `devpriv->usb_rx_buf` and `devpriv->usb_tx_buf`, but
    `devpriv->usb_rx_buf` may have already beed freed, leading to a
    double-free error.  Fix it bu removing the call to
    `kfree(devpriv->usb_rx_buf)` from `ni6501_alloc_usb_buffers()`, relying
    on `ni6501_detach()` to free the memory.

    staging: comedi: ni_usb6501: Fix use of uninitialized mutex
    
    commit 660cf4ce9d0f3497cc7456eaa6d74c8b71d6282c upstream.
    
    If `ni6501_auto_attach()` returns an error, the core comedi module code
    will call `ni6501_detach()` to clean up.  If `ni6501_auto_attach()`
    successfully allocated the comedi device private data, `ni6501_detach()`
    assumes that a `struct mutex mut` contained in the private data has been
    initialized and uses it.  Unfortunately, there are a couple of places
    where `ni6501_auto_attach()` can return an error after allocating the
    device private data but before initializing the mutex, so this
    assumption is invalid.  Fix it by initializing the mutex just after
    allocating the private data in `ni6501_auto_attach()` before any other
    errors can be retturned.  Also move the call to `usb_set_intfdata()`
    just to keep the code a bit neater (either position for the call is
    fine).
    
    I believe this was the cause of the following syzbot crash report
    <https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=cf4f2b6c24aff0a3edf6>:

    iio: core: fix a possible circular locking dependency
    
    commit 7f75591fc5a123929a29636834d1bcb8b5c9fee3 upstream.
    
    This fixes a possible circular locking dependency detected warning seen
    with:
    - CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=y
    - consumer/provider IIO devices (ex: "voltage-divider" consumer of "adc")
    
    When using the IIO consumer interface, e.g. iio_channel_get(), the consumer
    device will likely call iio_read_channel_raw() or similar that rely on
    'info_exist_lock' mutex.
    
    typically:
    ...
            mutex_lock(&chan->indio_dev->info_exist_lock);
            if (chan->indio_dev->info == NULL) {
                    ret = -ENODEV;
                    goto err_unlock;
            }
            ret = do_some_ops()
    err_unlock:
            mutex_unlock(&chan->indio_dev->info_exist_lock);
            return ret;
    ...
    
    Same mutex is also hold in iio_device_unregister().
    
    The following deadlock warning happens when:
    - the consumer device has called an API like iio_read_channel_raw()
      at least once.
    - the consumer driver is unregistered, removed (unbind from sysfs)

           ----                    ----
      lock(&dev->info_exist_lock);
                                   lock(kn->count#30);
                                   lock(&dev->info_exist_lock);
      lock(kn->count#30);
    
     *** DEADLOCK ***
    ...
    
    cdev_device_del() can be called without holding the lock. It should be safe
    as info_exist_lock prevents kernelspace consumers to use the exported
    routines during/after provider removal. cdev_device_del() is for userspace.
    
    Help to reproduce:
    See example: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/afe/voltage-divider.txt
    sysv {
            compatible = "voltage-divider";
            io-channels = <&adc 0>;
            output-ohms = <22>;
            full-ohms = <222>;
    };
    
    First, go to iio:deviceX for the "voltage-divider", do one read:
    $ cd /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX
    $ cat in_voltage0_raw
    
    Then, unbind the consumer driver. It triggers above deadlock warning.
    $ cd /sys/bus/platform/drivers/iio-rescale/
    $ echo sysv > unbind
    
    Note I don't actually expect stable will pick this up all the
    way back into IIO being in staging, but if's probably valid that
    far back.

    iio: adc: at91: disable adc channel interrupt in timeout case
    
    commit 09c6bdee51183a575bf7546890c8c137a75a2b44 upstream.
    
    Having a brief look at at91_adc_read_raw() it is obvious that in the case
    of a timeout the setting of AT91_ADC_CHDR and AT91_ADC_IDR registers is
    omitted. If 2 different channels are queried we can end up with a
    situation where two interrupts are enabled, but only one interrupt is
    cleared in the interrupt handler. Resulting in a interrupt loop and a
    system hang.

    iio: Fix scan mask selection
    
    commit 20ea39ef9f2f911bd01c69519e7d69cfec79fde3 upstream.
    
    The trialmask is expected to have all bits set to 0 after allocation.
    Currently kmalloc_array() is used which does not zero the memory and so
    random bits are set. This results in random channels being enabled when
    they shouldn't. Replace kmalloc_array() with kcalloc() which has the same
    interface but zeros the memory.
    
    Note the fix is actually required earlier than the below fixes tag, but
    will require a manual backport due to move from kmalloc to kmalloc_array.

    iio: dac: mcp4725: add missing powerdown bits in store eeprom
    
    commit 06003531502d06bc89d32528f6ec96bf978790f9 upstream.
    
    When issuing the write DAC register and write eeprom command, the two
    powerdown bits (PD0 and PD1) are assumed by the chip to be present in
    the bytes sent. Leaving them at 0 implies "powerdown disabled" which is
    a different state that the current one. By adding the current state of
    the powerdown in the i2c write, the chip will correctly power-on exactly
    like as it is at the moment of store_eeprom call.
    
    This is documented in MCP4725's datasheet, FIGURE 6-2: "Write Commands
    for DAC Input Register and EEPROM" and MCP4726's datasheet, FIGURE 6-3:
    "Write All Memory Command".

    commit 3d02d7082e5823598090530c3988a35f69689943 upstream.
    
    Calculation did not use IIO_DEGREE_TO_RAD and implemented a variant to
    avoid precision loss as we aim a nano value. The offset added to avoid
    rounding error, though, doesn't give us a close result to the expected
    value. E.g.
    
    For 1000dps, the result should be:
    
        (1000 * pi ) / 180 >> 15 ~= 0.000532632218
    
    But with current calculation we get
    
        $ cat scale
        0.000547890
    
    Fix the calculation by just doing the maths involved for a nano value
    
       val * pi * 10e12 / (180 * 2^15)
    
    so we get a closer result.

    KVM: x86: svm: make sure NMI is injected after nmi_singlestep
    
    commit 99c221796a810055974b54c02e8f53297e48d146 upstream.
    
    I noticed that apic test from kvm-unit-tests always hangs on my EPYC 7401P,
    the hanging test nmi-after-sti is trying to deliver 30000 NMIs and tracing
    shows that we're sometimes able to deliver a few but never all.
    
    When we're trying to inject an NMI we may fail to do so immediately for
    various reasons, however, we still need to inject it so enable_nmi_window()
    arms nmi_singlestep mode. #DB occurs as expected, but we're not checking
    for pending NMIs before entering the guest and unless there's a different
    event to process, the NMI will never get delivered.
    
    Make KVM_REQ_EVENT request on the vCPU from db_interception() to make sure
    pending NMIs are checked and possibly injected.

    KVM: x86: Don't clear EFER during SMM transitions for 32-bit vCPU
    
    commit 8f4dc2e77cdfaf7e644ef29693fa229db29ee1de upstream.
    
    Neither AMD nor Intel CPUs have an EFER field in the legacy SMRAM save
    state area, i.e. don't save/restore EFER across SMM transitions.  KVM
    somewhat models this, e.g. doesn't clear EFER on entry to SMM if the
    guest doesn't support long mode.  But during RSM, KVM unconditionally
    clears EFER so that it can get back to pure 32-bit mode in order to
    start loading CRs with their actual non-SMM values.
    
    Clear EFER only when it will be written when loading the non-SMM state
    so as to preserve bits that can theoretically be set on 32-bit vCPUs,
    e.g. KVM always emulates EFER_SCE.
    
    And because CR4.PAE is cleared only to play nice with EFER, wrap that
    code in the long mode check as well.  Note, this may result in a
    compiler warning about cr4 being consumed uninitialized.  Re-read CR4
    even though it's technically unnecessary, as doing so allows for more
    readable code and RSM emulation is not a performance critical path.

    CIFS: keep FileInfo handle live during oplock break
    
    commit b98749cac4a695f084a5ff076f4510b23e353ecd upstream.
    
    In the oplock break handler, writing pending changes from pages puts
    the FileInfo handle. If the refcount reaches zero it closes the handle
    and waits for any oplock break handler to return, thus causing a deadlock.
    
    To prevent this situation:
    
    * We add a wait flag to cifsFileInfo_put() to decide whether we should
      wait for running/pending oplock break handlers
    
    * We keep an additionnal reference of the SMB FileInfo handle so that
      for the rest of the handler putting the handle won't close it.
      - The ref is bumped everytime we queue the handler via the
        cifs_queue_oplock_break() helper.
      - The ref is decremented at the end of the handler
    
    This bug was triggered by xfstest 464.

    [ Upstream commit 5ee15c101f29e0093ffb5448773ccbc786eb313b ]
    
    The thunderx driver splits frames bigger than 1530 bytes to multiple

    This leads to a maximum MTU of 1508 if QinQ is in use.

    ipv4: recompile ip options in ipv4_link_failure
    
    [ Upstream commit ed0de45a1008991fdaa27a0152befcb74d126a8b ]
    
    Recompile IP options since IPCB may not be valid anymore when
    ipv4_link_failure is called from arp_error_report.
    
    Refer to the commit 3da1ed7ac398 ("net: avoid use IPCB in cipso_v4_error")
    and the commit before that (9ef6b42ad6fd) for a similar issue.

    team: set slave to promisc if team is already in promisc mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 43c2adb9df7ddd6560fd3546d925b42cef92daa0 ]
    
    After adding a team interface to bridge, the team interface will enter
    promisc mode. Then if we add a new slave to team0, the slave will keep
    promisc off. Fix it by setting slave to promisc on if team master is
    already in promisc mode, also do the same for allmulti.

    tcp: tcp_grow_window() needs to respect tcp_space()
    
    [ Upstream commit 50ce163a72d817a99e8974222dcf2886d5deb1ae ]
    
    For some reason, tcp_grow_window() correctly tests if enough room
    is present before attempting to increase tp->rcv_ssthresh,
    but does not prevent it to grow past tcp_space()
    
    This is causing hard to debug issues, like failing
    the (__tcp_select_window(sk) >= tp->rcv_wnd) test
    in __tcp_ack_snd_check(), causing ACK delays and possibly
    slow flows.
    
    Depending on tcp_rmem[2], MTU, skb->len/skb->truesize ratio,
    we can see the problem happening on "netperf -t TCP_RR -- -r 2000,2000"
    after about 60 round trips, when the active side no longer sends
    immediate acks.
    
    This bug predates git history.

    gue tunnels run iptunnel_pull_offloads on received skbs. This can
    determine a possible use-after-free accessing guehdr pointer since
    the packet will be 'uncloned' running pskb_expand_head if it is a

    net: bridge: fix per-port af_packet sockets
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b2e2904deb314cc77a2192f506f2fd44e3d10d0 ]
    
    When the commit below was introduced it changed two visible things:
     - the skb was no longer passed through the protocol handlers with the
       original device
     - the skb was passed up the stack with skb->dev = bridge
    
    The first change broke af_packet sockets on bridge ports. For example we
    use them for hostapd which listens for ETH_P_PAE packets on the ports.
    We discussed two possible fixes:
     - create a clone and pass it through NF_HOOK(), act on the original skb
       based on the result
     - somehow signal to the caller from the okfn() that it was called,
       meaning the skb is ok to be passed, which this patch is trying to
       implement via returning 1 from the bridge link-local okfn()
    
    Note that we rely on the fact that NF_QUEUE/STOLEN would return 0 and
    drop/error would return < 0 thus the okfn() is called only when the
    return was 1, so we signal to the caller that it was called by preserving
    the return value from nf_hook().

    net: atm: Fix potential Spectre v1 vulnerabilities
    
    [ Upstream commit 899537b73557aafbdd11050b501cf54b4f5c45af ]
    
    arg is controlled by user-space, hence leading to a potential
    exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.
    
    This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:
    
    net/atm/lec.c:715 lec_mcast_attach() warn: potential spectre issue 'dev_lec' [r] (local cap)
    
    Fix this by sanitizing arg before using it to index dev_lec.
    
    Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
    to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
    completed with a dependent load/store [1].

    bonding: fix event handling for stacked bonds
    
    [ Upstream commit 92480b3977fd3884649d404cbbaf839b70035699 ]
    
    When a bond is enslaved to another bond, bond_netdev_event() only
    handles the event as if the bond is a master, and skips treating the
    bond as a slave.
    
    This leads to a refcount leak on the slave, since we don't remove the
    adjacency to its master and the master holds a reference on the slave.
    
    Reproducer:
      ip link add bondL type bond
      ip link add bondU type bond
      ip link set bondL master bondU
      ip link del bondL
