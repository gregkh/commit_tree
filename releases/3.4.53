    This reverts commit 48f0f14ffb6ff4852922994d11fbda418d40100e which was
    commit 749c8814f08f12baa4a9c2812a7c6ede7d69507d upstream.
    
    It seems to be misapplied, and not needed for 3.4-stable

    SCSI: sd: Fix parsing of 'temporary ' cache mode prefix
    
    commit 2ee3e26c673e75c05ef8b914f54fadee3d7b9c88 upstream.
    
    Commit 39c60a0948cc '[SCSI] sd: fix array cache flushing bug causing
    performance problems' added temp as a pointer to "temporary " and used
    sizeof(temp) - 1 as its length.  But sizeof(temp) is the size of the
    pointer, not the size of the string constant.  Change temp to a static
    array so that sizeof() does what was intended.

    nfsd4: fix decoding of compounds across page boundaries
    
    commit 247500820ebd02ad87525db5d9b199e5b66f6636 upstream.
    
    A freebsd NFSv4.0 client was getting rare IO errors expanding a tarball.
    A network trace showed the server returning BAD_XDR on the final getattr
    of a getattr+write+getattr compound.  The final getattr started on a
    page boundary.
    
    I believe the Linux client ignores errors on the post-write getattr, and
    that that's why we haven't seen this before.

    Revert "serial: 8250_pci: add support for another kind of NetMos Technology PCI 9835 Multi-I/O Controller"
    
    commit 828c6a102b1f2b8583fadc0e779c46b31d448f0b upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 8d2f8cd424ca0b99001f3ff4f5db87c4e525f366.
    
    As reported by Stefan, this device already works with the parport_serial
    driver, so the 8250_pci driver should not also try to grab it as well.

    block: do not pass disk names as format strings
    
    commit ffc8b30866879ed9ba62bd0a86fecdbd51cd3d19 upstream.
    
    Disk names may contain arbitrary strings, so they must not be
    interpreted as format strings.  It seems that only md allows arbitrary
    strings to be used for disk names, but this could allow for a local
    memory corruption from uid 0 into ring 0.

    commit 3ebacb05044f82c5f0bb456a894eb9dc57d0ed90 upstream.
    
    The test if bitmap access is out of bound could errorneously pass if the
    device size is divisible by 16384 sectors and we are asking for one bitmap
    after the end.
    
    Check for invalid size in the superblock. Invalid size could cause integer
    overflows in the rest of the code.

    drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c: use kzalloc() for failing hardware
    
    commit 542db01579fbb7ea7d1f7bb9ddcef1559df660b2 upstream.
    
    In drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c mmc_ioctl_cdrom_read_data() allocates a memory
    area with kmalloc in line 2885.
    
      2885         cgc->buffer = kmalloc(blocksize, GFP_KERNEL);
      2886         if (cgc->buffer == NULL)
      2887                 return -ENOMEM;
    
    In line 2908 we can find the copy_to_user function:
    
      2908         if (!ret && copy_to_user(arg, cgc->buffer, blocksize))
    
    The cgc->buffer is never cleaned and initialized before this function.
    If ret = 0 with the previous basic block, it's possible to display some
    memory bytes in kernel space from userspace.
    
    When we read a block from the disk it normally fills the ->buffer but if
    the drive is malfunctioning there is a chance that it would only be
    partially filled.  The result is an leak information to userspace.

    libceph: Fix NULL pointer dereference in auth client code
    
    commit 2cb33cac622afde897aa02d3dcd9fbba8bae839e upstream.
    
    A malicious monitor can craft an auth reply message that could cause a
    NULL function pointer dereference in the client's kernel.
    
    To prevent this, the auth_none protocol handler needs an empty
    ceph_auth_client_ops->build_request() function.
