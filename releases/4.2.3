    hp-wmi: limit hotkey enable
    
    commit 8a1513b49321e503fd6c8b6793e3b1f9a8a3285b upstream.
    
    Do not write initialize magic on systems that do not have
    feature query 0xb. Fixes Bug #82451.
    
    Redefine FEATURE_QUERY to align with 0xb and FEATURE2 with 0xd
    for code clearity.
    
    Add a new test function, hp_wmi_bios_2008_later() & simplify
    hp_wmi_bios_2009_later(), which fixes a bug in cases where
    an improper value is returned. Probably also fixes Bug #69131.
    
    Add missing __init tag.

    zram: fix possible use after free in zcomp_create()
    
    commit 3aaf14da807a4e9931a37f21e4251abb8a67021b upstream.
    
    zcomp_create() verifies the success of zcomp_strm_{multi,single}_create()
    through comp->stream, which can potentially be pointing to memory that
    was freed if these functions returned an error.
    
    While at it, replace a 'ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM)' by a more generic
    'ERR_PTR(error)' as in the future zcomp_strm_{multi,siggle}_create()
    could return other error codes.  Function documentation updated
    accordingly.

    mvneta: use inband status only when explicitly enabled
    
    [ Upstream commit f8af8e6eb95093d5ce5ebcc52bd1929b0433e172 in net-next tree,
      will be pushed to Linus very soon. ]
    
    The commit 898b2970e2c9 ("mvneta: implement SGMII-based in-band link state
    signaling") implemented the link parameters auto-negotiation unconditionally.
    Unfortunately it appears that some HW that implements SGMII protocol,
    doesn't generate the inband status, so it is not possible to auto-negotiate
    anything with such HW.
    
    This patch enables the auto-negotiation only if explicitly requested with
    the 'managed' DT property.
    
    This patch fixes the following regression:

    of_mdio: add new DT property 'managed' to specify the PHY management type
    
    [ Upstream commit 4cba5c2103657d43d0886e4cff8004d95a3d0def in net-next tree,
      will be pushed to Linus very soon. ]
    
    Currently the PHY management type is selected by the MAC driver arbitrary.
    The decision is based on the presence of the "fixed-link" node and on a
    will of the driver's authors.
    This caused a regression recently, when mvneta driver suddenly started
    to use the in-band status for auto-negotiation on fixed links.
    It appears the auto-negotiation may not work when expected by the MAC driver.
    Sebastien Rannou explains:
    << Yes, I confirm that my HW does not generate an in-band status. AFAIK, it's
    a PHY that aggregates 4xSGMIIs to 1xQSGMII ; the MAC side of the PHY (with
    inband status) is connected to the switch through QSGMII, and in this context
    we are on the media side of the PHY. >>
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/7/10/206
    
    This patch introduces the new string property 'managed' that allows
    the user to set the management type explicitly.
    The supported values are:
    "auto" - default. Uses either MDIO or nothing, depending on the presence
    of the fixed-link node
    "in-band-status" - use in-band status

    net: phy: fixed_phy: handle link-down case
    
    [ Upstream 868a4215be9a6d80548ccb74763b883dc99d32a2 in net-next tree,
      will be pushed to Linus very soon. ]
    
    fixed_phy_register() currently hardcodes the fixed PHY link to 1, and
    expects to find a "speed" parameter to provide correct information
    towards the fixed PHY consumer.
    
    In a subsequent change, where we allow "managed" (e.g: (RS)GMII in-band
    status auto-negotiation) fixed PHYs, none of these parameters can be
    provided since they will be auto-negotiated, hence, we just provide a
    zero-initialized fixed_phy_status to fixed_phy_register() which makes it
    fail when we call fixed_phy_update_regs() since status.speed = 0 which
    makes us hit the "default" label and error out.
    
    Without this change, we would also see potentially inconsistent
    speed/duplex parameters for fixed PHYs when the link is DOWN.

    net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Do not override speed settings
    
    [ Upstream d2eac98f7d1b950b762a7eca05a9ce0ea1d878d2 in net-next tree,
      will be pushed to Linus very soon. ]
    
    The SF2 driver currently overrides speed settings for its port
    configured using a fixed PHY, this is both unnecessary and incorrect,
    because we keep feedback to the hardware parameters that we read from
    the PHY device, which in the case of a fixed PHY cannot possibly change
    speed.
    
    This is a required change to allow the fixed PHY code to allow
    registering a PHY with a link configured as DOWN by default and avoid
    some sort of circular dependency where we require the link_update
    callback to run to program the hardware, and we then utilize the fixed
    PHY parameters to program the hardware with the same settings.

    fib_rules: fix fib rule dumps across multiple skbs
    
    [ Upstream commit 41fc014332d91ee90c32840bf161f9685b7fbf2b ]
    
    dump_rules returns skb length and not error.
    But when family == AF_UNSPEC, the caller of dump_rules
    assumes that it returns an error. Hence, when family == AF_UNSPEC,
    we continue trying to dump on -EMSGSIZE errors resulting in
    incorrect dump idx carried between skbs belonging to the same dump.
    This results in fib rule dump always only dumping rules that fit
    into the first skb.
    
    This patch fixes dump_rules to return error so that we exit correctly
    and idx is correctly maintained between skbs that are part of the
    same dump.

    tcp: add proper TS val into RST packets
    
    [ Upstream commit 675ee231d960af2af3606b4480324e26797eb010 ]
    
    RST packets sent on behalf of TCP connections with TS option (RFC 7323
    TCP timestamps) have incorrect TS val (set to 0), but correct TS ecr.
    
    A > B: Flags [S], seq 0, win 65535, options [mss 1000,nop,nop,TS val 100
    ecr 0], length 0
    B > A: Flags [S.], seq 2444755794, ack 1, win 28960, options [mss
    1460,nop,nop,TS val 7264344 ecr 100], length 0
    A > B: Flags [.], ack 1, win 65535, options [nop,nop,TS val 110 ecr
    7264344], length 0
    
    B > A: Flags [R.], seq 1, ack 1, win 28960, options [nop,nop,TS val 0
    ecr 110], length 0
    
    We need to call skb_mstamp_get() to get proper TS val,
    derived from skb->skb_mstamp
    
    Note that RFC 1323 was advocating to not send TS option in RST segment,
    but RFC 7323 recommends the opposite :
    
      Once TSopt has been successfully negotiated, that is both <SYN> and
      <SYN,ACK> contain TSopt, the TSopt MUST be sent in every non-<RST>
      segment for the duration of the connection, and SHOULD be sent in an
      <RST> segment (see Section 5.2 for details)
    
    Note this RFC recommends to send TS val = 0, but we believe it is
    premature : We do not know if all TCP stacks are properly
    handling the receive side :
    
       When an <RST> segment is

    openvswitch: Zero flows on allocation.
    
    [ Upstream commit ae5f2fb1d51fa128a460bcfbe3c56d7ab8bf6a43 ]
    
    When support for megaflows was introduced, OVS needed to start
    installing flows with a mask applied to them. Since masking is an
    expensive operation, OVS also had an optimization that would only
    take the parts of the flow keys that were covered by a non-zero
    mask. The values stored in the remaining pieces should not matter
    because they are masked out.
    
    While this works fine for the purposes of matching (which must always
    look at the mask), serialization to netlink can be problematic. Since
    the flow and the mask are serialized separately, the uninitialized
    portions of the flow can be encoded with whatever values happen to be
    present.
    
    In terms of functionality, this has little effect since these fields
    will be masked out by definition. However, it leaks kernel memory to
    userspace, which is a potential security vulnerability. It is also
    possible that other code paths could look at the masked key and get
    uninitialized data, although this does not currently appear to be an
    issue in practice.
    
    This removes the mask optimization for flows that are being installed.
    This was always intended to be the case as the mask optimizations were
    really targetting per-packet flow operations.

    net: dsa: actually force the speed on the CPU port
    
    [ Upstream commit 53adc9e83028d9e35b6408231ebaf62a94a16e4d ]
    
    Commit 54d792f257c6 ("net: dsa: Centralise global and port setup
    code into mv88e6xxx.") merged in the 4.2 merge window broke the link
    speed forcing for the CPU port of Marvell DSA switches.  The original
    code was:
    
            /* MAC Forcing register: don't force link, speed, duplex
             * or flow control state to any particular values on physical
             * ports, but force the CPU port and all DSA ports to 1000 Mb/s
             * full duplex.
             */
            if (dsa_is_cpu_port(ds, p) || ds->dsa_port_mask & (1 << p))
                    REG_WRITE(addr, 0x01, 0x003e);
            else
                    REG_WRITE(addr, 0x01, 0x0003);
    
    but the new code does a read-modify-write:
    
                    reg = _mv88e6xxx_reg_read(ds, REG_PORT(port), PORT_PCS_CTRL);
                    if (dsa_is_cpu_port(ds, port) ||
                        ds->dsa_port_mask & (1 << port)) {
                            reg |= PORT_PCS_CTRL_FORCE_LINK |
                                    PORT_PCS_CTRL_LINK_UP |
                                    PORT_PCS_CTRL_DUPLEX_FULL |
                                    PORT_PCS_CTRL_FORCE_DUPLEX;
                            if (mv88e6xxx_6065_family(ds))
                                    reg |= PORT_PCS_CTRL_100;
                            else
                                    reg |= PORT_PCS_CTRL_1000;
    
    The link speed in the PCS control register is a two bit field.  Forcing
    the link speed in this way doesn't ensure that the bit field is set to
    the correct value - on the hardware I have here, the speed bitfield
    remains set to 0x03, resulting in the speed not being forced to gigabit.
    
    We must clear both bits before forcing the link speed.

    OK I've decided to drop the acquire/release helpers as they don't
    help us at all and simply pessimises the code by using full memory
    barriers (on some architectures) where only a write or read barrier
    is needed.

    But you are right we do need an explicit write barrier here to
    ensure that the hashing is visible.

    It's not about being overly smart.  It's about actually understanding
    what's going on with the code.  I've seen too many instances of
    people simply sprinkling synchronisation primitives around without
    any knowledge of what is happening underneath, which is just a recipe
    for creating hard-to-debug races.

    The reason this one is OK is because we do not use nlk->portid or
    try to get nlk from the hash table before we return to user-space.
    
    However, there is a real bug here that none of these acquire/release
    helpers discovered.  The two bound tests here used to be a single
    one.  Now that they are separate it is entirely possible for another
    thread to come in the middle and bind the socket.  So we need to
    repeat the portid check in order to maintain consistency.

    Ditto.

    The commit 1f770c0a09da855a2b51af6d19de97fb955eca85 ("netlink:
    Fix autobind race condition that leads to zero port ID") created
    some new races that can occur due to inconcsistencies between the
    two port IDs.
    
    Tejun is right that a barrier is unavoidable.  Therefore I am
    reverting to the original patch that used a boolean to indicate
    that a user netlink socket has been bound.
    
    Barriers have been added where necessary to ensure that a valid
    portid and the hashed socket is visible.
    
    I have also changed netlink_insert to only return EBUSY if the
    socket is bound to a portid different to the requested one.  This
    combined with only reading nlk->bound once in netlink_bind fixes
    a race where two threads that bind the socket at the same time
    with different port IDs may both succeed.

    condition where if two threads try to autobind the same socket
    one of them may end up with a zero port ID.  This led to kernel
    deadlocks that were observed by multiple people.
    
    This patch reverts that commit and instead fixes it by introducing
    a separte rhash_portid variable so that the real portid is only set
    after the socket has been successfully hashed.

    sctp: fix race on protocol/netns initialization
    
    [ Upstream commit 8e2d61e0aed2b7c4ecb35844fe07e0b2b762dee4 ]
    
    Consider sctp module is unloaded and is being requested because an user
    is creating a sctp socket.
    
    During initialization, sctp will add the new protocol type and then
    initialize pernet subsys:
    
            status = sctp_v4_protosw_init();
            if (status)
                    goto err_protosw_init;
    
            status = sctp_v6_protosw_init();
            if (status)
                    goto err_v6_protosw_init;
    
            status = register_pernet_subsys(&sctp_net_ops);
    
    The problem is that after those calls to sctp_v{4,6}_protosw_init(), it
    is possible for userspace to create SCTP sockets like if the module is
    already fully loaded. If that happens, one of the possible effects is
    that we will have readers for net->sctp.local_addr_list list earlier
    than expected and sctp_net_init() does not take precautions while
    dealing with that list, leading to a potential panic but not limited to
    that, as sctp_sock_init() will copy a bunch of blank/partially
    initialized values from net->sctp.
    
    The race happens like this:
    
         CPU 0                           |  CPU 1
      socket()                           |

         list_for_each_entry_rcu(        |
            answer, &inetsw[sock->type], |
            list) {                      |   inet_create
          /* no hits */                  |
         if (unlikely(err)) {            |

    Simply inverting the initialization order between
    register_pernet_subsys() and sctp_v4_protosw_init() is not possible
    because register_pernet_subsys() will create a control sctp socket, so
    the protocol must be already visible by then. Deferring the socket
    creation to a work-queue is not good specially because we loose the
    ability to handle its errors.
    
    So, as suggested by Vlad, the fix is to split netns initialization in
    two moments: defaults and control socket, so that the defaults are
    already loaded by when we register the protocol, while control socket
    initialization is kept at the same moment it is today.

    netlink, mmap: transform mmap skb into full skb on taps
    
    [ Upstream commit 1853c949646005b5959c483becde86608f548f24 ]
    
    Ken-ichirou reported that running netlink in mmap mode for receive in
    combination with nlmon will throw a NULL pointer dereference in
    __kfree_skb() on nlmon_xmit(), in my case I can also trigger an "unable
    to handle kernel paging request". The problem is the skb_clone() in
    __netlink_deliver_tap_skb() for skbs that are mmaped.
    
    I.e. the cloned skb doesn't have a destructor, whereas the mmap netlink
    skb has it pointed to netlink_skb_destructor(), set in the handler
    netlink_ring_setup_skb(). There, skb->head is being set to NULL, so
    that in such cases, __kfree_skb() doesn't perform a skb_release_data()
    via skb_release_all(), where skb->head is possibly being freed through
    kfree(head) into slab allocator, although netlink mmap skb->head points
    to the mmap buffer. Similarly, the same has to be done also for large
    netlink skbs where the data area is vmalloced. Therefore, as discussed,
    make a copy for these rather rare cases for now. This fixes the issue
    on my and Ken-ichirou's test-cases.

    ipv6: fix multipath route replace error recovery
    
    [ Upstream commit 6b9ea5a64ed5eeb3f68f2e6fcce0ed1179801d1e ]
    
    Problem:
    The ecmp route replace support for ipv6 in the kernel, deletes the
    existing ecmp route too early, ie when it installs the first nexthop.
    If there is an error in installing the subsequent nexthops, its too late
    to recover the already deleted existing route leaving the fib
    in an inconsistent state.
    
    This patch reduces the possibility of this by doing the following:
    a) Changes the existing multipath route add code to a two stage process:
      build rt6_infos + insert them
            ip6_route_add rt6_info creation code is moved into
            ip6_route_info_create.
    b) This ensures that most errors are caught during building rt6_infos
      and we fail early
    c) Separates multipath add and del code. Because add needs the special
      two stage mode in a) and delete essentially does not care.
    d) In any event if the code fails during inserting a route again, a
      warning is printed (This should be unlikely)
    
    Before the patch:
    $ip -6 route show

    net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Fix ageing conditions and operation
    
    [ Upstream commit 39797a279d62972cd914ef580fdfacb13e508bf8 ]
    
    The comparison check between cur_hw_state and hw_state is currently
    invalid because cur_hw_state is right shifted by G_MISTP_SHIFT, while
    hw_state is not, so we end-up comparing bits 2:0 with bits 7:5, which is
    going to cause an additional aging to occur. Fix this by not shifting
    cur_hw_state while reading it, but instead, mask the value with the
    appropriately shitfted bitmask.
    
    The other problem with the fast-ageing process is that we did not set
    the EN_AGE_DYNAMIC bit to request the ageing to occur for dynamically
    learned MAC addresses. Finally, write back 0 to the FAST_AGE_CTRL
    register to avoid leaving spurious bits sets from one operation to the
    other.

    net: fec: clear receive interrupts before processing a packet
    
    [ Upstream commit ed63f1dcd5788d36f942fbcce350742385e3e18c ]
    
    The patch just to re-submit the patch "db3421c114cfa6326" because the
    patch "4d494cdc92b3b9a0" remove the change.
    
    Clear any pending receive interrupt before we process a pending packet.
    This helps to avoid any spurious interrupts being raised after we have
    fully cleaned the receive ring, while still allowing an interrupt to be
    raised if we receive another packet.
    
    The position of this is critical: we must do this prior to reading the
    next packet status to avoid potentially dropping an interrupt when a
    packet is still pending.

    sock, diag: fix panic in sock_diag_put_filterinfo
    
    [ Upstream commit b382c08656000c12a146723a153b85b13a855b49 ]
    
    diag socket's sock_diag_put_filterinfo() dumps classic BPF programs
    upon request to user space (ss -0 -b). However, native eBPF programs
    attached to sockets (SO_ATTACH_BPF) cannot be dumped with this method:
    
    Their orig_prog is always NULL. However, sock_diag_put_filterinfo()
    unconditionally tries to access its filter length resp. wants to copy
    the filter insns from there. Internal cBPF to eBPF transformations
    attached to sockets don't have this issue, as orig_prog state is kept.
    
    It's currently only used by packet sockets. If we would want to add
    native eBPF support in the future, this needs to be done through
    a different attribute than PACKET_DIAG_FILTER to not confuse possible
    user space disassemblers that work on diag data.

    The problem is that mdiobus_unregister() deletes the bus device before
    unregistering the phy devices on the bus. This wasn't a problem before
    because the phys were not children of the bus:
    
      /sys/devices/platform/APMC0D05:00/net/eth0/xgene-mii-eth0:03
      /sys/devices/platform/APMC0D05:00/net/eth0/xgene-mii-eth0
    
    But now that they are:
    
      /sys/devices/platform/APMC0D05:00/net/eth0/xgene-mii-eth0/xgene-mii-eth0:03
    
    when mdiobus_unregister deletes the bus device, the phy subdirs are
    removed from sysfs also. So when the phys are unregistered afterward,
    we get the warning. This patch changes the order so that phys are
    unregistered before the bus device is deleted.
