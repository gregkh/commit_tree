    rsi: fix control-message timeout
    
    commit 541fd20c3ce5b0bc39f0c6a52414b6b92416831c upstream.
    
    USB control-message timeouts are specified in milliseconds and should
    specifically not vary with CONFIG_HZ.
    
    Use the common control-message timeout define for the five-second
    timeout.

    comedi: vmk80xx: fix bulk and interrupt message timeouts
    
    commit a56d3e40bda460edf3f8d6aac00ec0b322b4ab83 upstream.
    
    USB bulk and interrupt message timeouts are specified in milliseconds
    and should specifically not vary with CONFIG_HZ.
    
    Note that the bulk-out transfer timeout was set to the endpoint
    bInterval value, which should be ignored for bulk endpoints and is
    typically set to zero. This meant that a failing bulk-out transfer
    would never time out.
    
    Assume that the 10 second timeout used for all other transfers is more
    than enough also for the bulk-out endpoint.

    comedi: vmk80xx: fix bulk-buffer overflow
    
    commit 78cdfd62bd54af615fba9e3ca1ba35de39d3871d upstream.
    
    The driver is using endpoint-sized buffers but must not assume that the
    tx and rx buffers are of equal size or a malicious device could overflow
    the slab-allocated receive buffer when doing bulk transfers.

    comedi: vmk80xx: fix transfer-buffer overflows
    
    commit a23461c47482fc232ffc9b819539d1f837adf2b1 upstream.
    
    The driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but up until
    recently had no sanity checks on the sizes.
    
    Commit e1f13c879a7c ("staging: comedi: check validity of wMaxPacketSize
    of usb endpoints found") inadvertently fixed NULL-pointer dereferences
    when accessing the transfer buffers in case a malicious device has a
    zero wMaxPacketSize.
    
    Make sure to allocate buffers large enough to handle also the other
    accesses that are done without a size check (e.g. byte 18 in
    vmk80xx_cnt_insn_read() for the VMK8061_MODEL) to avoid writing beyond
    the buffers, for example, when doing descriptor fuzzing.
    
    The original driver was for a low-speed device with 8-byte buffers.
    Support was later added for a device that uses bulk transfers and is
    presumably a full-speed device with a maximum 64-byte wMaxPacketSize.

    The driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but had no sanity

    commit 536de747bc48262225889a533db6650731ab25d3 upstream.
    
    USB transfer buffers are typically mapped for DMA and must not be
    allocated on the stack or transfers will fail.
    
    Allocate proper transfer buffers in the various command helpers and
    return an error on short transfers instead of acting on random stack
    data.
    
    Note that this also fixes a stack info leak on systems where DMA is not
    used as 32 bytes are always sent to the device regardless of how short
    the command is.

    printk/console: Allow to disable console output by using console="" or console=null
    
    commit 3cffa06aeef7ece30f6b5ac0ea51f264e8fea4d0 upstream.
    
    The commit 48021f98130880dd74 ("printk: handle blank console arguments
    passed in.") prevented crash caused by empty console= parameter value.
    
    Unfortunately, this value is widely used on Chromebooks to disable
    the console output. The above commit caused performance regression
    because the messages were pushed on slow console even though nobody
    was watching it.
    
    Use ttynull driver explicitly for console="" and console=null
    parameters. It has been created for exactly this purpose.
    
    It causes that preferred_console is set. As a result, ttySX and ttyX
    are not used as a fallback. And only ttynull console gets registered by
    default.
    
    It still allows to register other consoles either by additional console=
    parameters or SPCR. It prevents regression because it worked this way even
    before. Also it is a sane semantic. Preventing output on all consoles
    should be done another way, for example, by introducing mute_console
    parameter.

    commit 05c8f1b67e67dcd786ae3fe44492bbc617b4bd12 upstream.
    
    These drive enclosures have firmware bugs that make it impossible to mount
    a new virtual ISO image after Linux ejects the old one if the device is
    locked by Linux. Windows bypasses this problem by the fact that they do
    not lock the device. Add a quirk to disable device locking for these
    drive enclosures.

    commit 21b5fcdccb32ff09b6b63d4a83c037150665a83f upstream.
    
    musb_gadget_queue() adds the passed request to musb_ep::req_list. If the
    endpoint is idle and it is the first request then it invokes
    musb_queue_resume_work(). If the function returns an error then the
    error is passed to the caller without any clean-up and the request
    remains enqueued on the list. If the caller enqueues the request again
    then the list corrupts.
    
    Remove the request from the list on error.
