    usb: optimize acpi companion search for usb port devices
    
    commit ed18c5fa945768a9bec994e786edbbbc7695acf6 upstream.
    
    This optimization significantly reduces xhci driver load time.
    
    In ACPI tables the acpi companion port devices are children of
    the hub device. The port devices are identified by their port number
    returned by the ACPI _ADR method.
    _ADR 0 is reserved for the root hub device.
    
    The current implementation to find a acpi companion port device
    loops through all acpi port devices under that parent hub, evaluating
    their _ADR method each time a new port device is added.
    
    for a xHC controller with 25 ports under its roothub it
    will end up invoking ACPI bytecode 625 times before all ports
    are ready, making it really slow.
    
    The _ADR values are already read and cached earler. So instead of
    running the bytecode again we can check the cached _ADR value first,
    and then fall back to the old way.
    
    As one of the more significant changes, the xhci load time on
    Intel kabylake reduced by 70%, (28ms) from
    initcall xhci_pci_init+0x0/0x49 returned 0 after 39537 usecs
    to
    initcall xhci_pci_init+0x0/0x49 returned 0 after 11270 usecs

    pids: make task_tgid_nr_ns() safe
    
    commit dd1c1f2f2028a7b851f701fc6a8ebe39dcb95e7c upstream.
    
    This was reported many times, and this was even mentioned in commit
    52ee2dfdd4f5 ("pids: refactor vnr/nr_ns helpers to make them safe") but
    somehow nobody bothered to fix the obvious problem: task_tgid_nr_ns() is
    not safe because task->group_leader points to nowhere after the exiting
    task passes exit_notify(), rcu_read_lock() can not help.
    
    We really need to change __unhash_process() to nullify group_leader,
    parent, and real_parent, but this needs some cleanups.  Until then we
    can turn task_tgid_nr_ns() into another user of __task_pid_nr_ns() and
    fix the problem.

    Sanitize 'move_pages()' permission checks
    
    commit 197e7e521384a23b9e585178f3f11c9fa08274b9 upstream.
    
    The 'move_paghes()' system call was introduced long long ago with the
    same permission checks as for sending a signal (except using
    CAP_SYS_NICE instead of CAP_SYS_KILL for the overriding capability).
    
    That turns out to not be a great choice - while the system call really
    only moves physical page allocations around (and you need other
    capabilities to do a lot of it), you can check the return value to map
    out some the virtual address choices and defeat ASLR of a binary that
    still shares your uid.
    
    So change the access checks to the more common 'ptrace_may_access()'
    model instead.
    
    This tightens the access checks for the uid, and also effectively
    changes the CAP_SYS_NICE check to CAP_SYS_PTRACE, but it's unlikely that
    anybody really _uses_ this legacy system call any more (we hav ebetter
    NUMA placement models these days), so I expect nobody to notice.
    
    Famous last words.

    genirq: Restore trigger settings in irq_modify_status()
    
    commit e8f241893dfbbebe2813c01eac54f263e6a5e59c upstream.
    
    irq_modify_status starts by clearing the trigger settings from
    irq_data before applying the new settings, but doesn't restore them,
    leaving them to IRQ_TYPE_NONE.
    
    That's pretty confusing to the potential request_irq() that could
    follow. Instead, snapshot the settings before clearing them, and restore
    them if the irq_modify_status() invocation was not changing the trigger.

    xen-blkfront: use a right index when checking requests
    
    commit b15bd8cb37598afb2963f7eb9e2de468d2d60a2f upstream.
    
    Since commit d05d7f40791c ("Merge branch 'for-4.8/core' of

    has been using an index for iterating ring_info to check request when
    iterating blk_shadow in an inner loop. This seems to have been

    commit 5a69aec945d27e78abac9fd032533d3aaebf7c1e upstream.
    
    VSX uses a combination of the old vector registers, the old FP
    registers and new "second halves" of the FP registers.
    
    Thus when we need to see the VSX state in the thread struct
    (flush_vsx_to_thread()) or when we'll use the VSX in the kernel
    (enable_kernel_vsx()) we need to ensure they are all flushed into
    the thread struct if either of them is individually enabled.
    
    Unfortunately we only tested if the whole VSX was enabled, not if they
    were individually enabled.

    xen: fix bio vec merging
    
    commit 462cdace790ac2ed6aad1b19c9c0af0143b6aab0 upstream.
    
    The current test for bio vec merging is not fully accurate and can be
    tricked into merging bios when certain grant combinations are used.
    The result of these malicious bio merges is a bio that extends past
    the memory page used by any of the originating bios.
    
    Take into account the following scenario, where a guest creates two
    grant references that point to the same mfn, ie: grant 1 -> mfn A,
    grant 2 -> mfn A.
    
    These references are then used in a PV block request, and mapped by
    the backend domain, thus obtaining two different pfns that point to
    the same mfn, pfn B -> mfn A, pfn C -> mfn A.
    
    If those grants happen to be used in two consecutive sectors of a disk
    IO operation becoming two different bios in the backend domain, the
    checks in xen_biovec_phys_mergeable will succeed, because bfn1 == bfn2
    (they both point to the same mfn). However due to the bio merging,
    the backend domain will end up with a bio that expands past mfn A into
    mfn A + 1.
    
    Fix this by making sure the check in xen_biovec_phys_mergeable takes
    into account the offset and the length of the bio, this basically
    replicates whats done in __BIOVEC_PHYS_MERGEABLE using mfns (bus
    addresses). While there also remove the usage of
    __BIOVEC_PHYS_MERGEABLE, since that's already checked by the callers
    of xen_biovec_phys_mergeable.

    mm: revert x86_64 and arm64 ELF_ET_DYN_BASE base changes
    
    commit c715b72c1ba406f133217b509044c38d8e714a37 upstream.
    
    Moving the x86_64 and arm64 PIE base from 0x555555554000 to 0x000100000000
    broke AddressSanitizer.  This is a partial revert of:
    
      eab09532d400 ("binfmt_elf: use ELF_ET_DYN_BASE only for PIE")
      02445990a96e ("arm64: move ELF_ET_DYN_BASE to 4GB / 4MB")
    
    The AddressSanitizer tool has hard-coded expectations about where
    executable mappings are loaded.
    
    The motivation for changing the PIE base in the above commits was to
    avoid the Stack-Clash CVEs that allowed executable mappings to get too
    close to heap and stack.  This was mainly a problem on 32-bit, but the
    64-bit bases were moved too, in an effort to proactively protect those
    systems (proofs of concept do exist that show 64-bit collisions, but
    other recent changes to fix stack accounting and setuid behaviors will
    minimize the impact).
    
    The new 32-bit PIE base is fine for ASan (since it matches the ET_EXEC
    base), so only the 64-bit PIE base needs to be reverted to let x86 and
    arm64 ASan binaries run again.  Future changes to the 64-bit PIE base on
    these architectures can be made optional once a more dynamic method for
    dealing with AddressSanitizer is found.  (e.g.  always loading PIE into
    the mmap region for marked binaries.)

    mm/mempolicy: fix use after free when calling get_mempolicy
    
    commit 73223e4e2e3867ebf033a5a8eb2e5df0158ccc99 upstream.

    !shared memory policy is not protected against parallel removal by other

    however, drops the lock midway while we can still access it later.
    
    Early premature up_read is a historical artifact from times when
    put_user was called in this path see https://lwn.net/Articles/124754/
    but that is gone since 8bccd85ffbaf ("[PATCH] Implement sys_* do_*
    layering in the memory policy layer.").  but when we have the the
    current mempolicy ref count model.  The issue was introduced
    accordingly.
    
    Fix the issue by removing the premature release.

    mm: fix double mmap_sem unlock on MMF_UNSTABLE enforced SIGBUS
    
    commit 5b53a6ea886700a128b697a6fe8375340dea2c30 upstream.
    
    Tetsuo Handa has noticed that MMF_UNSTABLE SIGBUS path in

         page_fault+0x28/0x30
    
    The reason is that the page fault path might have dropped the mmap_sem
    and returned with VM_FAULT_RETRY.  MMF_UNSTABLE check however rewrites
    the error path to VM_FAULT_SIGBUS and we always expect mmap_sem taken in
    that path.  Fix this by taking mmap_sem when VM_FAULT_RETRY is held in
    the MMF_UNSTABLE path.
    
    We cannot simply add VM_FAULT_SIGBUS to the existing error code because
    all arch specific page fault handlers and g-u-p would have to learn a
    new error code combination.

    mm: discard memblock data later
    
    commit 3010f876500f9ba921afaeccec30c45ca6584dc8 upstream.
    
    There is existing use after free bug when deferred struct pages are
    enabled:
    
    The memblock_add() allocates memory for the memory array if more than
    128 entries are needed.  See comment in e820__memblock_setup():
    
      * The bootstrap memblock region count maximum is 128 entries
      * (INIT_MEMBLOCK_REGIONS), but EFI might pass us more E820 entries
      * than that - so allow memblock resizing.
    
    This memblock memory is freed here:
            free_low_memory_core_early()
    
    We access the freed memblock.memory later in boot when deferred pages
    are initialized in this path:
    
            deferred_init_memmap()
                    for_each_mem_pfn_range()
                      __next_mem_pfn_range()
                        type = &memblock.memory;
    
    One possible explanation for why this use-after-free hasn't been hit
    before is that the limit of INIT_MEMBLOCK_REGIONS has never been
    exceeded at least on systems where deferred struct pages were enabled.
    
    Tested by reducing INIT_MEMBLOCK_REGIONS down to 4 from the current 128,
    and verifying in qemu that this code is getting excuted and that the
    freed pages are sane.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Add mute TLV for playback volumes on C-Media devices
    
    commit 0f174b3525a43bd51f9397394763925e0ebe7bc7 upstream.
    
    C-Media devices (at least some models) mute the playback stream when
    volumes are set to the minimum value.  But this isn't informed via TLV
    and the user-space, typically PulseAudio, gets confused as if it's
    still played in a low volume.
    
    This patch adds the new flag, min_mute, to struct usb_mixer_elem_info
    for indicating that the mixer element is with the minimum-mute volume.
    This flag is set for known C-Media devices in
    snd_usb_mixer_fu_apply_quirk() in turn.

    ALSA: seq: 2nd attempt at fixing race creating a queue
    
    commit 7e1d90f60a0d501c8503e636942ca704a454d910 upstream.
    
    commit 4842e98f26dd80be3623c4714a244ba52ea096a8 ("ALSA: seq: Fix race at
    creating a queue") attempted to fix a race reported by syzkaller. That
    fix has been described as follows:
    
    "
    When a sequencer queue is created in snd_seq_queue_alloc(),it adds the
    new queue element to the public list before referencing it.  Thus the
    queue might be deleted before the call of snd_seq_queue_use(), and it
    results in the use-after-free error, as spotted by syzkaller.
    
    The fix is to reference the queue object at the right time.
    "
    
    Even with that fix in place, syzkaller reported a use-after-free error.
    It specifically pointed to the last instruction "return q->queue" in
    snd_seq_queue_alloc(). The pointer q is being used after kfree() has
    been called on it.
    
    It turned out that there is still a small window where a race can
    happen. The window opens at
    snd_seq_ioctl_create_queue()->snd_seq_queue_alloc()->queue_list_add()
    and closes at
    snd_seq_ioctl_create_queue()->queueptr()->snd_use_lock_use(). Between
    these two calls, a different thread could delete the queue and possibly
    re-create a different queue in the same location in queue_list.
    
    This change prevents this situation by calling snd_use_lock_use() from
    snd_seq_queue_alloc() prior to calling queue_list_add(). It is then the
    caller's responsibility to call snd_use_lock_free(&q->use_lock).

    audit_remove_watch_rule() drops watch's reference to parent but then
    continues to work with it. That is not safe as parent can get freed once
    we drop our reference. The following is a trivial reproducer:
    
    mount -o loop image /mnt
    touch /mnt/file
    auditctl -w /mnt/file -p wax
    umount /mnt
    auditctl -D
    <crash in fsnotify_destroy_mark()>
    
    Grab our own reference in audit_remove_watch_rule() earlier to make sure
    mark does not get freed under us.

    netfilter: nf_ct_ext: fix possible panic after nf_ct_extend_unregister
    
    commit 9c3f3794926a997b1cab6c42480ff300efa2d162 upstream.
    
    If one cpu is doing nf_ct_extend_unregister while another cpu is doing
    __nf_ct_ext_add_length, then we may hit BUG_ON(t == NULL). Moreover,
    there's no synchronize_rcu invocation after set nf_ct_ext_types[id] to
    NULL, so it's possible that we may access invalid pointer.
    
    But actually, most of the ct extends are built-in, so the problem listed
    above will not happen. However, there are two exceptions: NF_CT_EXT_NAT
    and NF_CT_EXT_SYNPROXY.
    
    For _EXT_NAT, the panic will not happen, since adding the nat extend and
    unregistering the nat extend are located in the same file(nf_nat_core.c),
    this means that after the nat module is removed, we cannot add the nat
    extend too.
    
    For _EXT_SYNPROXY, synproxy extend may be added by init_conntrack, while
    synproxy extend unregister will be done by synproxy_core_exit. So after
    nf_synproxy_core.ko is removed, we may still try to add the synproxy
    extend, then kernel panic may happen.
    
    I know it's very hard to reproduce this issue, but I can play a tricky
    game to make it happen very easily :)
    
    Step 1. Enable SYNPROXY for tcp dport 1234 at FORWARD hook:
      # iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp --dport 1234 -j SYNPROXY
    Step 2. Queue the syn packet to the userspace at raw table OUTPUT hook.
            Also note, in the userspace we only add a 20s' delay, then
            reinject the syn packet to the kernel:
      # iptables -t raw -I OUTPUT -p tcp --syn -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 1
    Step 3. Using "nc 2.2.2.2 1234" to connect the server.
    Step 4. Now remove the nf_synproxy_core.ko quickly:
      # iptables -F FORWARD
      # rmmod ipt_SYNPROXY
      # rmmod nf_synproxy_core
    Step 5. After 20s' delay, the syn packet is reinjected to the kernel.
    
    Now you will see the panic like this:
      kernel BUG at net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_extend.c:91!
      Call Trace:

       [...]
    
    One possible solution is to make NF_CT_EXT_SYNPROXY extend built-in, i.e.
    introduce nf_conntrack_synproxy.c and only do ct extend register and
    unregister in it, similar to nf_conntrack_timeout.c.
    
    But having such a obscure restriction of nf_ct_extend_unregister is not a
    good idea, so we should invoke synchronize_rcu after set nf_ct_ext_types
    to NULL, and check the NULL pointer when do __nf_ct_ext_add_length. Then
    it will be easier if we add new ct extend in the future.
    
    Last, we use kfree_rcu to free nf_ct_ext, so rcu_barrier() is unnecessary
    anymore, remove it too.
