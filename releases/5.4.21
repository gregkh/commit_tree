    [ Upstream commit 9073d10b098973519044f5fcdc25586810b435da ]
    
    Use MMC_CAP2_RO_ACTIVE_HIGH flag as indicator if GPIO line is to be
    inverted compared to DT/platform-specified polarity. The flag is not used
    after init in GPIO mode anyway. No functional changes intended.

    KVM: x86/mmu: Fix struct guest_walker arrays for 5-level paging
    
    [ Upstream commit f6ab0107a4942dbf9a5cf0cca3f37e184870a360 ]
    
    Define PT_MAX_FULL_LEVELS as PT64_ROOT_MAX_LEVEL, i.e. 5, to fix shadow
    paging for 5-level guest page tables.  PT_MAX_FULL_LEVELS is used to
    size the arrays that track guest pages table information, i.e. using a
    "max levels" of 4 causes KVM to access garbage beyond the end of an
    array when querying state for level 5 entries.  E.g. FNAME(gpte_changed)
    will read garbage and most likely return %true for a level 5 entry,
    soft-hanging the guest because FNAME(fetch) will restart the guest
    instead of creating SPTEs because it thinks the guest PTE has changed.
    
    Note, KVM doesn't yet support 5-level nested EPT, so PT_MAX_FULL_LEVELS
    gets to stay "4" for the PTTYPE_EPT case.

    ext4: choose hardlimit when softlimit is larger than hardlimit in ext4_statfs_project()
    
    [ Upstream commit 57c32ea42f8e802bda47010418e25043e0c9337f ]
    
    Setting softlimit larger than hardlimit seems meaningless
    for disk quota but currently it is allowed. In this case,
    there may be a bit of comfusion for users when they run
    df comamnd to directory which has project quota.
    
    For example, we set 20M softlimit and 10M hardlimit of
    block usage limit for project quota of test_dir(project id 123).
    
    [root@hades mnt_ext4]# repquota -P -a
    *** Report for project quotas on device /dev/loop0
    Block grace time: 7days; Inode grace time: 7days
                            Block limits                File limits

    /dev/loop0       20M   10M   10M  50% /home/cgxu/test/mnt_ext4
    
    Even though it looks like there is another 10M free space to use,
    if we write new data to diretory test_dir(inherit project id),
    the write will fail with errno(-EDQUOT).
    
    After this patch, the df result looks like below.

    buffer which belongs to the committing transaction, it indicate the

    *) Dir entry block bh1 and bh2 belongs to one page, and the bh2 has
       already been unmapped.
    
    For the metadata buffer we forgetting, we should always keep the mapped
    flag and clear the dirty flags is enough, so this patch pick out the
    these buffers and keep their BH_Mapped flag.

    commit cf913e9683273f2640501094fa63a67e29f437b3 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 9db9c0cf5895e4ddde2814360cae7bea9282edd2.
    
    Setting mode_config.allow_fb_modifiers manually is completely
    unnecessary. It is set automatically by drm_universal_plane_init() based
    on the fact if modifier list is provided or not. Even more, it breaks
    DE2 and DE3 as they don't support any modifiers beside linear. Modifiers
    aware applications can be confused by provided empty modifier list - at
    least linear modifier should be included, but it's not for DE2 and DE3.

    perf stat: Don't report a null stalled cycles per insn metric
    
    commit 80cc7bb6c104d733bff60ddda09f19139c61507c upstream.
    
    For data collected on machines with front end stalled cycles supported,
    such as found on modern AMD CPU families, commit 146540fb545b ("perf
    stat: Always separate stalled cycles per insn") introduces a new line in
    CSV output with a leading comma that upsets some automated scripts.
    Scripts have to use "-e ex_ret_instr" to work around this issue, after
    upgrading to a version of perf with that commit.
    
    We could add "if (have_frontend_stalled && !config->csv_sep)" to the not
    (total && avg) else clause, to emphasize that CSV users are usually
    scripts, and are written to do only what is needed, i.e., they wouldn't
    typically invoke "perf stat" without specifying an explicit event list.
    
    But - let alone CSV output - why should users now tolerate a constant
    0-reporting extra line in regular terminal output?:
    
    BEFORE:
    
    $ sudo perf stat --all-cpus -einstructions,cycles -- sleep 1
    
     Performance counter stats for 'system wide':
    
           181,110,981      instructions              #    0.58  insn per cycle
                                                      #    0.00  stalled cycles per insn
           309,876,469      cycles
    
           1.002202582 seconds time elapsed
    
    The user would not like to see the now permanent:
    
      "0.00  stalled cycles per insn"
    
    line fixture, as it gives no useful information.
    
    So this patch removes the printing of the zeroed stalled cycles line
    altogether, almost reverting the very original commit fb4605ba47e7
    ("perf stat: Check for frontend stalled for metrics"), which seems like
    it was written to normalize --metric-only column output of common Intel
    machines at the time: modern Intel machines have ceased to support the
    genericised frontend stalled metrics AFAICT.
    
    AFTER:
    
    $ sudo perf stat --all-cpus -einstructions,cycles -- sleep 1
    
     Performance counter stats for 'system wide':
    
           244,071,432      instructions              #    0.69  insn per cycle
           355,353,490      cycles
    
           1.001862516 seconds time elapsed
    
    Output behaviour when stalled cycles is indeed measured is not affected
    (BEFORE == AFTER):
    
    $ sudo perf stat --all-cpus -einstructions,cycles,stalled-cycles-frontend -- sleep 1
    
     Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

    The interrupt map for the FVP's PCI node is missing the
    parent-unit-address cells for each of the INTx entries, leading to the
    kernel code failing to parse the entries correctly.
    
    Add the missing zero cells, which are pretty useless as far as the GIC

    hwmon: (pmbus/ltc2978) Fix PMBus polling of MFR_COMMON definitions.
    
    commit cf2b012c90e74e85d8aea7d67e48868069cfee0c upstream.
    
    Change 21537dc driver PMBus polling of MFR_COMMON from bits 5/4 to
    bits 6/5. This fixs a LTC297X family bug where polling always returns
    not busy even when the part is busy. This fixes a LTC388X and
    LTM467X bug where polling used PEND and NOT_IN_TRANS, and BUSY was
    not polled, which can lead to NACKing of commands. LTC388X and
    LTM467X modules now poll BUSY and PEND, increasing reliability by
    eliminating NACKing of commands.

    perf/x86/intel: Fix inaccurate period in context switch for auto-reload
    
    commit f861854e1b435b27197417f6f90d87188003cb24 upstream.
    
    Perf doesn't take the left period into account when auto-reload is
    enabled with fixed period sampling mode in context switch.
    
    Here is the MSR trace of the perf command as below.
    (The MSR trace is simplified from a ftrace log.)
    
        #perf record -e cycles:p -c 2000000 -- ./triad_loop
    
          //The MSR trace of task schedule out
          //perf disable all counters, disable PEBS, disable GP counter 0,
          //read GP counter 0, and re-enable all counters.
          //The counter 0 stops at 0xfffffff82840
          write_msr: MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL(38f), value 0
          write_msr: MSR_IA32_PEBS_ENABLE(3f1), value 0
          write_msr: MSR_P6_EVNTSEL0(186), value 40003003c
          rdpmc: 0, value fffffff82840
          write_msr: MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL(38f), value f000000ff
    
          //The MSR trace of the same task schedule in again
          //perf disable all counters, enable and set GP counter 0,
          //enable PEBS, and re-enable all counters.
          //0xffffffe17b80 (-2000000) is written to GP counter 0.
          write_msr: MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL(38f), value 0
          write_msr: MSR_IA32_PMC0(4c1), value ffffffe17b80
          write_msr: MSR_P6_EVNTSEL0(186), value 40043003c
          write_msr: MSR_IA32_PEBS_ENABLE(3f1), value 1
          write_msr: MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL(38f), value f000000ff
    
    When the same task schedule in again, the counter should starts from
    previous left. However, it starts from the fixed period -2000000 again.
    
    A special variant of intel_pmu_save_and_restart() is used for
    auto-reload, which doesn't update the hwc->period_left.
    When the monitored task schedules in again, perf doesn't know the left
    period. The fixed period is used, which is inaccurate.
    
    With auto-reload, the counter always has a negative counter value. So
    the left period is -value. Update the period_left in
    intel_pmu_save_and_restart_reload().
    
    With the patch:
    
          //The MSR trace of task schedule out
          write_msr: MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL(38f), value 0
          write_msr: MSR_IA32_PEBS_ENABLE(3f1), value 0
          write_msr: MSR_P6_EVNTSEL0(186), value 40003003c
          rdpmc: 0, value ffffffe25cbc
          write_msr: MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL(38f), value f000000ff
    
          //The MSR trace of the same task schedule in again
          write_msr: MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL(38f), value 0
          write_msr: MSR_IA32_PMC0(4c1), value ffffffe25cbc
          write_msr: MSR_P6_EVNTSEL0(186), value 40043003c
          write_msr: MSR_IA32_PEBS_ENABLE(3f1), value 1

    RDMA/rxe: Fix soft lockup problem due to using tasklets in softirq
    
    commit 8ac0e6641c7ca14833a2a8c6f13d8e0a435e535c upstream.
    
    When run stress tests with RXE, the following Call Traces often occur
    
      watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#2 stuck for 22s! [swapper/2:0]
      ...
      Call Trace:

      apic_timer_interrupt+0xf/0x20
      </IRQ>
      ...
    
    The root cause is that tasklet is actually a softirq. In a tasklet
    handler, another softirq handler is triggered. Usually these softirq
    handlers run on the same cpu core. So this will cause "soft lockup Bug".

    RDMA/iw_cxgb4: initiate CLOSE when entering TERM
    
    commit d219face9059f38ad187bde133451a2a308fdb7c upstream.
    
    As per draft-hilland-iwarp-verbs-v1.0, sec 6.2.3, always initiate a CLOSE
    when entering into TERM state.
    
    In c4iw_modify_qp(), disconnect operation should only be performed when
    the modify_qp call is invoked from ib_core. And all other internal
    modify_qp calls(invoked within iw_cxgb4) that needs 'disconnect' should
    call c4iw_ep_disconnect() explicitly after modify_qp. Otherwise, deadlocks
    like below can occur:
    
     Call Trace:

    RDMA/core: Fix invalid memory access in spec_filter_size
    
    commit a72f4ac1d778f7bde93dfee69bfc23377ec3d74f upstream.
    
    Add a check that the size specified in the flow spec header doesn't cause
    an overflow when calculating the filter size, and thus prevent access to
    invalid memory.  The following crash from syzkaller revealed it.

    IB/umad: Fix kernel crash while unloading ib_umad
    
    commit 9ea04d0df6e6541c6736b43bff45f1e54875a1db upstream.
    
    When disassociating a device from umad we must ensure that the sysfs
    access is prevented before blocking the fops, otherwise assumptions in
    syfs don't hold:
    
                CPU0                        CPU1
             ib_umad_kill_port()        ibdev_show()
                port->ib_dev = NULL
                                          dev_name(port->ib_dev)
    
    The prior patch made an error in moving the device_destroy(), it should
    have been split into device_del() (above) and put_device() (below). At
    this point we already have the split, so move the device_del() back to its
    original place.

    commit f92e48718889b3d49cee41853402aa88cac84a6b upstream.
    
    When the hfi1 device is shut down during a system reboot, it is possible
    that some QPs might have not not freed by ULPs. More requests could be
    post sent and a lingering timer could be triggered to schedule more packet
    sends, leading to a crash:

    The solution is to reset the QPs before the device resources are freed.
    This reset will change the QP state to prevent post sends and delete
    timers to prevent callbacks.

    The panic is the result of slab entries being freed during the destruction
    of the pq slab.
    
    The code attempts to quiesce the pq, but looking for n_req == 0 doesn't
    account for new requests.
    
    Fix the issue by using SRCU to get a pq pointer and adjust the pq free
    logic to NULL the fd pq pointer prior to the quiesce.

    IB/hfi1: Acquire lock to release TID entries when user file is closed
    
    commit a70ed0f2e6262e723ae8d70accb984ba309eacc2 upstream.
    
    Each user context is allocated a certain number of RcvArray (TID)
    entries and these entries are managed through TID groups. These groups
    are put into one of three lists in each user context: tid_group_list,
    tid_used_list, and tid_full_list, depending on the number of used TID
    entries within each group. When TID packets are expected, one or more
    TID groups will be allocated. After the packets are received, the TID
    groups will be freed. Since multiple user threads may access the TID
    groups simultaneously, a mutex exp_mutex is used to synchronize the
    access. However, when the user file is closed, it tries to release
    all TID groups without acquiring the mutex first, which risks a race
    condition with another thread that may be releasing its TID groups,
    leading to data corruption.
    
    This patch addresses the issue by acquiring the mutex first before
    releasing the TID groups when the file is closed.
    
    Fixes: 3abb33ac6521 ("staging/hfi1: Add TID cache receive init and free funcs")

    IB/mlx5: Return failure when rts2rts_qp_counters_set_id is not supported
    
    commit 10189e8e6fe8dcde13435f9354800429c4474fb1 upstream.
    
    When binding a QP with a counter and the QP state is not RESET, return
    failure if the rts2rts_qp_counters_set_id is not supported by the
    device.
    
    This is to prevent cases like manual bind for Connect-IB devices from
    returning success when the feature is not supported.

    drm/vgem: Close use-after-free race in vgem_gem_create
    
    commit 4b848f20eda5974020f043ca14bacf7a7e634fc8 upstream.
    
    There's two references floating around here (for the object reference,
    not the handle_count reference, that's a different thing):
    
    - The temporary reference held by vgem_gem_create, acquired by
      creating the object and released by calling
      drm_gem_object_put_unlocked.
    
    - The reference held by the object handle, created by
      drm_gem_handle_create. This one generally outlives the function,
      except if a 2nd thread races with a GEM_CLOSE ioctl call.
    
    So usually everything is correct, except in that race case, where the
    access to gem_object->size could be looking at freed data already.
    Which again isn't a real problem (userspace shot its feet off already
    with the race, we could return garbage), but maybe someone can exploit
    this as an information leak.

    commit 27dc0700c3be7c681cea03c5230b93d02f623492 upstream.
    
    The query parameter block might contain additional information and can
    be extended in the future. If the size of the block does not suffice we
    get an error code of rc=0x100.  The buffer will contain all information
    up to the specified size and the hypervisor/guest simply do not need the
    additional information as they do not know about the new data.  That
    means that we can (and must) accept rc=0x100 as success.

    s390/pkey: fix missing length of protected key on return
    
    commit aab73d278d49c718b722ff5052e16c9cddf144d4 upstream.
    
    The pkey ioctl call PKEY_SEC2PROTK updates a struct pkey_protkey
    on return. The protected key is stored in, the protected key type
    is stored in but the len information was not updated. This patch
    now fixes this and so the len field gets an update to refrect
    the actual size of the protected key value returned.

    perf/x86/amd: Add missing L2 misses event spec to AMD Family 17h's event map
    
    commit 25d387287cf0330abf2aad761ce6eee67326a355 upstream.
    
    Commit 3fe3331bb285 ("perf/x86/amd: Add event map for AMD Family 17h"),
    claimed L2 misses were unsupported, due to them not being found in its
    referenced documentation, whose link has now moved [1].
    
    That old documentation listed PMCx064 unit mask bit 3 as:
    
        "LsRdBlkC: LS Read Block C S L X Change to X Miss."
    
    and bit 0 as:
    
        "IcFillMiss: IC Fill Miss"
    
    We now have new public documentation [2] with improved descriptions, that
    clearly indicate what events those unit mask bits represent:
    
    Bit 3 now clearly states:
    
        "LsRdBlkC: Data Cache Req Miss in L2 (all types)"
    
    and bit 0 is:
    
        "IcFillMiss: Instruction Cache Req Miss in L2."
    
    So we can now add support for L2 misses in perf's genericised events as
    PMCx064 with both the above unit masks.

    EDAC/mc: Fix use-after-free and memleaks during device removal
    
    commit 216aa145aaf379a50b17afc812db71d893bd6683 upstream.
    
    A test kernel with the options DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE, KASAN and
    DEBUG_KMEMLEAK set, revealed several issues when removing an mci device:
    
    1) Use-after-free:
    
    On 27.11.19 17:07:33, John Garry wrote:
    > [   22.104498] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in
    > edac_remove_sysfs_mci_device+0x148/0x180
    
    The use-after-free is caused by the mci_for_each_dimm() macro called in
    edac_remove_sysfs_mci_device(). The iterator was introduced with
    
      c498afaf7df8 ("EDAC: Introduce an mci_for_each_dimm() iterator").
    
    The iterator loop calls device_unregister(&dimm->dev), which removes
    the sysfs entry of the device, but also frees the dimm struct in
    dimm_attr_release(). When incrementing the loop in mci_for_each_dimm(),
    the dimm struct is accessed again, after having been freed already.
    
    The fix is to free all the mci device's subsequent dimm and csrow
    objects at a later point, in _edac_mc_free(), when the mci device itself
    is being freed.
    
    This keeps the data structures intact and the mci device can be
    fully used until its removal. The change allows the safe usage of
    mci_for_each_dimm() to release dimm devices from sysfs.
    
    2) Memory leaks:
    
    Following memory leaks have been detected:
    
     # grep edac /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak | sort | uniq -c
           1     [<000000003c0f58f9>] edac_mc_alloc+0x3bc/0x9d0      # mci->csrows
          16     [<00000000bb932dc0>] edac_mc_alloc+0x49c/0x9d0      # csr->channels
          16     [<00000000e2734dba>] edac_mc_alloc+0x518/0x9d0      # csr->channels[chn]
           1     [<00000000eb040168>] edac_mc_alloc+0x5c8/0x9d0      # mci->dimms
          34     [<00000000ef737c29>] ghes_edac_register+0x1c8/0x3f8 # see edac_mc_alloc()
    
    All leaks are from memory allocated by edac_mc_alloc().
    
    Note: The test above shows that edac_mc_alloc() was called here from
    ghes_edac_register(), thus both functions show up in the stack trace
    but the module causing the leaks is edac_mc. The comments with the data
    structures involved were made manually by analyzing the objdump.
    
    The data structures listed above and created by edac_mc_alloc() are
    not properly removed during device removal, which is done in
    edac_mc_free().
    
    There are two paths implemented to remove the device depending on device
    registration, _edac_mc_free() is called if the device is not registered
    and edac_unregister_sysfs() otherwise.
    
    The implemenations differ. For the sysfs case, the mci device removal
    lacks the removal of subsequent data structures (csrows, channels,
    dimms). This causes the memory leaks (see mci_attr_release()).

    EDAC/sysfs: Remove csrow objects on errors
    
    commit 4d59588c09f2a2daedad2a544d4d1b602ab3a8af upstream.
    
    All created csrow objects must be removed in the error path of
    edac_create_csrow_objects(). The objects have been added as devices.
    
    They need to be removed by doing a device_del() *and* put_device() call
    to also free their memory. The missing put_device() leaves a memory
    leak. Use device_unregister() instead of device_del() which properly
    unregisters the device doing both.

    xprtrdma: Fix DMA scatter-gather list mapping imbalance
    
    commit ca1c671302825182629d3c1a60363cee6f5455bb upstream.
    
    The @nents value that was passed to ib_dma_map_sg() has to be passed
    to the matching ib_dma_unmap_sg() call. If ib_dma_map_sg() choses to
    concatenate sg entries, it will return a different nents value than
    it was passed.
    
    The bug was exposed by recent changes to the AMD IOMMU driver, which
    enabled sg entry concatenation.
    
    Looking all the way back to commit 4143f34e01e9 ("xprtrdma: Port to
    new memory registration API") and reviewing other kernel ULPs, it's
    not clear that the frwr_map() logic was ever correct for this case.

    arm64: ssbs: Fix context-switch when SSBS is present on all CPUs
    
    commit fca3d33d8ad61eb53eca3ee4cac476d1e31b9008 upstream.
    
    When all CPUs in the system implement the SSBS extension, the SSBS field
    in PSTATE is the definitive indication of the mitigation state. Further,
    when the CPUs implement the SSBS manipulation instructions (advertised
    to userspace via an HWCAP), EL0 can toggle the SSBS field directly and
    so we cannot rely on any shadow state such as TIF_SSBD at all.
    
    Avoid forcing the SSBS field in context-switch on such a system, and
    simply rely on the PSTATE register instead.

    A remount to a read-write filesystem is not safe when there's tree-log
    to be replayed. Files that could be opened until now might be affected
    by the changes in the tree-log.
    
    A regular mount is needed to replay the log so the filesystem presents
    the consistent view with the pending changes included.

    btrfs: ref-verify: fix memory leaks
    
    commit f311ade3a7adf31658ed882aaab9f9879fdccef7 upstream.
    
    In btrfs_ref_tree_mod(), 'ref' and 'ra' are allocated through kzalloc() and
    kmalloc(), respectively. In the following code, if an error occurs, the
    execution will be redirected to 'out' or 'out_unlock' and the function will
    be exited. However, on some of the paths, 'ref' and 'ra' are not
    deallocated, leading to memory leaks. For example, if 'action' is
    BTRFS_ADD_DELAYED_EXTENT, add_block_entry() will be invoked. If the return
    value indicates an error, the execution will be redirected to 'out'. But,
    'ref' is not deallocated on this path, causing a memory leak.
    
    To fix the above issues, deallocate both 'ref' and 'ra' before exiting from
    the function when an error is encountered.

    Btrfs: fix race between using extent maps and merging them
    
    commit ac05ca913e9f3871126d61da275bfe8516ff01ca upstream.
    
    We have a few cases where we allow an extent map that is in an extent map
    tree to be merged with other extents in the tree. Such cases include the
    unpinning of an extent after the respective ordered extent completed or
    after logging an extent during a fast fsync. This can lead to subtle and
    dangerous problems because when doing the merge some other task might be
    using the same extent map and as consequence see an inconsistent state of
    the extent map - for example sees the new length but has seen the old start
    offset.
    
    With luck this triggers a BUG_ON(), and not some silent bug, such as the
    following one in __do_readpage():
    
      $ cat -n fs/btrfs/extent_io.c
      3061  static int __do_readpage(struct extent_io_tree *tree,

      3135                  BUG_ON(extent_map_end(em) <= cur);
      (...)
    
    Consider the following example scenario, where we end up hitting the
    BUG_ON() in __do_readpage().
    
    We have an inode with a size of 8KiB and 2 extent maps:
    
      extent A: file offset 0, length 4KiB, disk_bytenr = X, persisted on disk by
                a previous transaction
    
      extent B: file offset 4KiB, length 4KiB, disk_bytenr = X + 4KiB, not yet
                persisted but writeback started for it already. The extent map
                is pinned since there's writeback and an ordered extent in
                progress, so it can not be merged with extent map A yet
    
    The following sequence of steps leads to the BUG_ON():
    
    1) The ordered extent for extent B completes, the respective page gets its
       writeback bit cleared and the extent map is unpinned, at that point it
       is not yet merged with extent map A because it's in the list of modified
       extents;
    
    2) Due to memory pressure, or some other reason, the MM subsystem releases
       the page corresponding to extent B - btrfs_releasepage() is called and
       returns 1, meaning the page can be released as it's not dirty, not under
       writeback anymore and the extent range is not locked in the inode's
       iotree. However the extent map is not released, either because we are
       not in a context that allows memory allocations to block or because the
       inode's size is smaller than 16MiB - in this case our inode has a size
       of 8KiB;
    
    3) Task B needs to read extent B and ends up __do_readpage() through the
       btrfs_readpage() callback. At __do_readpage() it gets a reference to
       extent map B;
    
    4) Task A, doing a fast fsync, calls clear_em_loggin() against extent map B
       while holding the write lock on the inode's extent map tree - this
       results in try_merge_map() being called and since it's possible to merge
       extent map B with extent map A now (the extent map B was removed from
       the list of modified extents), the merging begins - it sets extent map
       B's start offset to 0 (was 4KiB), but before it increments the map's
       length to 8KiB (4kb + 4KiB), task A is at:
    
       BUG_ON(extent_map_end(em) <= cur);
    
       The call to extent_map_end() sees the extent map has a start of 0
       and a length still at 4KiB, so it returns 4KiB and 'cur' is 4KiB, so
       the BUG_ON() is triggered.
    
    So it's dangerous to modify an extent map that is in the tree, because some
    other task might have got a reference to it before and still using it, and
    needs to see a consistent map while using it. Generally this is very rare
    since most paths that lookup and use extent maps also have the file range
    locked in the inode's iotree. The fsync path is pretty much the only
    exception where we don't do it to avoid serialization with concurrent
    reads.
    
    Fix this by not allowing an extent map do be merged if if it's being used
    by tasks other then the one attempting to merge the extent map (when the
    reference count of the extent map is greater than 2).

    ext4: improve explanation of a mount failure caused by a misconfigured kernel
    
    commit d65d87a07476aa17df2dcb3ad18c22c154315bec upstream.
    
    If CONFIG_QFMT_V2 is not enabled, but CONFIG_QUOTA is enabled, when a
    user tries to mount a file system with the quota or project quota
    enabled, the kernel will emit a very confusing messsage:
    
        EXT4-fs warning (device vdc): ext4_enable_quotas:5914: Failed to enable quota tracking (type=0, err=-3). Please run e2fsck to fix.
        EXT4-fs (vdc): mount failed
    
    We will now report an explanatory message indicating which kernel
    configuration options have to be enabled, to avoid customer/sysadmin
    confusion.

    ext4: fix checksum errors with indexed dirs
    
    commit 48a34311953d921235f4d7bbd2111690d2e469cf upstream.
    
    DIR_INDEX has been introduced as a compat ext4 feature. That means that
    even kernels / tools that don't understand the feature may modify the
    filesystem. This works because for kernels not understanding indexed dir
    format, internal htree nodes appear just as empty directory entries.
    Index dir aware kernels then check the htree structure is still
    consistent before using the data. This all worked reasonably well until
    metadata checksums were introduced. The problem is that these
    effectively made DIR_INDEX only ro-compatible because internal htree
    nodes store checksums in a different place than normal directory blocks.
    Thus any modification ignorant to DIR_INDEX (or just clearing
    EXT4_INDEX_FL from the inode) will effectively cause checksum mismatch
    and trigger kernel errors. So we have to be more careful when dealing
    with indexed directories on filesystems with checksumming enabled.
    
    1) We just disallow loading any directory inodes with EXT4_INDEX_FL when
    DIR_INDEX is not enabled. This is harsh but it should be very rare (it
    means someone disabled DIR_INDEX on existing filesystem and didn't run
    e2fsck), e2fsck can fix the problem, and we don't want to answer the
    difficult question: "Should we rather corrupt the directory more or
    should we ignore that DIR_INDEX feature is not set?"
    
    2) When we find out htree structure is corrupted (but the filesystem and
    the directory should in support htrees), we continue just ignoring htree
    information for reading but we refuse to add new entries to the
    directory to avoid corrupting it more.

    ext4: fix support for inode sizes > 1024 bytes
    
    commit 4f97a68192bd33b9963b400759cef0ca5963af00 upstream.
    
    A recent commit, 9803387c55f7 ("ext4: validate the
    debug_want_extra_isize mount option at parse time"), moved mount-time
    checks around.  One of those changes moved the inode size check before
    the blocksize variable was set to the blocksize of the file system.
    After 9803387c55f7 was set to the minimum allowable blocksize, which
    in practice on most systems would be 1024 bytes.  This cuased file
    systems with inode sizes larger than 1024 bytes to be rejected with a
    message:

    It should be safe to ignore clock validity check result if the following
    conditions are met:
     - only one single sample rate is supported;
     - the terminal is directly connected to the clock source;
     - the clock type is internal.
    
    This is to deal with some Denon DJ controllers that always reports that
    clock is invalid.

    ACPI: PM: s2idle: Avoid possible race related to the EC GPE
    
    commit e3728b50cd9be7d4b1469447cdf1feb93e3b7adb upstream.
    
    It is theoretically possible for the ACPI EC GPE to be set after the
    s2idle_ops->wake() called from s2idle_loop() has returned and before
    the subsequent pm_wakeup_pending() check is carried out.  If that
    happens, the resulting wakeup event will cause the system to resume
    even though it may be a spurious one.
    
    To avoid that race, first make the ->wake() callback in struct
    platform_s2idle_ops return a bool value indicating whether or not
    to let the system resume and rearrange s2idle_loop() to use that
    value instad of the direct pm_wakeup_pending() call if ->wake() is
    present.
    
    Next, rework acpi_s2idle_wake() to process EC events and check
    pm_wakeup_pending() before re-arming the SCI for system wakeup
    to prevent it from triggering prematurely and add comments to
    that function to explain the rationale for the new code flow.

    ACPI: EC: Fix flushing of pending work
    
    commit f0ac20c3f6137910c8a927953e8a92f5b3716166 upstream.
    
    Commit 016b87ca5c8c ("ACPI: EC: Rework flushing of pending work")
    introduced a subtle bug into the flushing of pending EC work while
    suspended to idle, which may cause the EC driver to fail to
    re-enable the EC GPE after handling a non-wakeup event (like a
    battery status change event, for example).
    
    The problem is that the work item flushed by flush_scheduled_work()
    in __acpi_ec_flush_work() may disable the EC GPE and schedule another
    work item expected to re-enable it, but that new work item is not
    flushed, so __acpi_ec_flush_work() returns with the EC GPE disabled
    and the CPU running it goes into an idle state subsequently.  If all
    of the other CPUs are in idle states at that point, the EC GPE won't
    be re-enabled until at least one CPU is woken up by another interrupt
    source, so system wakeup events that would normally come from the EC
    then don't work.
    
    This is reproducible on a Dell XPS13 9360 in my office which
    sometimes stops reacting to power button and lid events (triggered
    by the EC on that machine) after switching from AC power to battery
    power or vice versa while suspended to idle (each of those switches
    causes the EC GPE to trigger for several times in a row, but they
    are not system wakeup events).
    
    To avoid this problem, it is necessary to drain the workqueue
    entirely in __acpi_ec_flush_work(), but that cannot be done with
    respect to system_wq, because work items may be added to it from
    other places while __acpi_ec_flush_work() is running.  For this
    reason, make the EC driver use a dedicated workqueue for EC events
    processing (let that workqueue be ordered so that EC events are
    processed sequentially) and use drain_workqueue() on it in
    __acpi_ec_flush_work().

    ALSA: usb-audio: Apply sample rate quirk for Audioengine D1
    
    commit 93f9d1a4ac5930654c17412e3911b46ece73755a upstream.
    
    The Audioengine D1 (0x2912:0x30c8) does support reading the sample rate,
    but it returns the rate in byte-reversed order.
    
    When setting sampling rate, the driver produces these warning messages:
    [168840.944226] usb 3-2.2: current rate 4500480 is different from the runtime rate 44100
    [168854.930414] usb 3-2.2: current rate 8436480 is different from the runtime rate 48000
    [168905.185825] usb 3-2.1.2: current rate 30465 is different from the runtime rate 96000
    
    As can be seen from the hexadecimal conversion, the current rate read
    back is byte-reversed from the rate that was set.
    
    44100 == 0x00ac44, 4500480 == 0x44ac00
    48000 == 0x00bb80, 8436480 == 0x80bb00
    96000 == 0x017700,   30465 == 0x007701
    
    Rather than implementing a new quirk to reverse the order, just skip
    checking the rate to avoid spamming the log.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix UAC2/3 effect unit parsing
    
    commit d75a170fd848f037a1e28893ad10be7a4c51f8a6 upstream.
    
    We've got a regression report about M-Audio Fast Track C400 device,
    and the git bisection resulted in the commit e0ccdef92653 ("ALSA:
    usb-audio: Clean up check_input_term()").  This commit was about the
    rewrite of the input terminal parser, and it's not too obvious from
    the change what really broke.  The answer is: it's the interpretation
    of UAC2/3 effect units.
    
    In the original code, UAC2 effect unit is as if through UAC1
    processing unit because both UAC1 PU and UAC2/3 EU share the same
    number (0x07).  The old code went through a complex switch-case
    fallthrough, finally bailing out in the middle:
    
      if (protocol == UAC_VERSION_2 &&
          hdr[2] == UAC2_EFFECT_UNIT) {
             /* UAC2/UAC1 unit IDs overlap here in an
              * uncompatible way. Ignore this unit for now.
              */
             return 0;
       }
    
    ... and this special handling was missing in the new code; the new
    code treats UAC2/3 effect unit as if it were equivalent with the
    processing unit.
    
    Actually, the old code was too confusing.  The effect unit has an
    incompatible unit description with the processing unit, so we
    shouldn't have dealt with EU in the same way.
    
    This patch addresses the regression by changing the effect unit
    handling to the own parser function.  The own parser function makes
    the clear distinct with PU, so it improves the readability, too.
    
    The EU parser just sets the type and the id like the old kernels.
    Once when the proper effect unit support is added, we can revisit this
    parser function, but for now, let's keep this simple setup as is.

    Input: synaptics - remove the LEN0049 dmi id from topbuttonpad list
    
    commit 5179a9dfa9440c1781816e2c9a183d1d2512dc61 upstream.
    
    The Yoga 11e is using LEN0049, but it doesn't have a trackstick.
    
    Thus, there is no need to create a software top buttons row.
    
    However, it seems that the device works under SMBus, so keep it as part
    of the smbus_pnp_ids.
