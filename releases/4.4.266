    can: flexcan: flexcan_chip_freeze(): fix chip freeze for missing bitrate
    
    commit 47c5e474bc1e1061fb037d13b5000b38967eb070 upstream.
    
    For cases when flexcan is built-in, bitrate is still not set at
    registering. So flexcan_chip_freeze() generates:
    
    [    1.860000] *** ZERO DIVIDE ***   FORMAT=4
    [    1.860000] Current process id is 1
    [    1.860000] BAD KERNEL TRAP: 00000000
    [    1.860000] PC: [<402e70c8>] flexcan_chip_freeze+0x1a/0xa8
    
    To allow chip freeze, using an hardcoded timeout when bitrate is still
    not set.

    init/Kconfig: make COMPILE_TEST depend on HAS_IOMEM
    
    commit ea29b20a828511de3348334e529a3d046a180416 upstream.
    
    I read the commit log of the following two:
    
    - bc083a64b6c0 ("init/Kconfig: make COMPILE_TEST depend on !UML")
    - 334ef6ed06fa ("init/Kconfig: make COMPILE_TEST depend on !S390")
    
    Both are talking about HAS_IOMEM dependency missing in many drivers.
    
    So, 'depends on HAS_IOMEM' seems the direct, sensible solution to me.
    
    This does not change the behavior of UML. UML still cannot enable
    COMPILE_TEST because it does not provide HAS_IOMEM.
    
    The current dependency for S390 is too strong. Under the condition of
    CONFIG_PCI=y, S390 provides HAS_IOMEM, hence can enable COMPILE_TEST.
    
    I also removed the meaningless 'default n'.

    init/Kconfig: make COMPILE_TEST depend on !S390
    
    commit 334ef6ed06fa1a54e35296b77b693bcf6d63ee9e upstream.
    
    While allmodconfig and allyesconfig build for s390 there are also
    various bots running compile tests with randconfig, where PCI is
    disabled. This reveals that a lot of drivers should actually depend on
    HAS_IOMEM.
    Adding this to each device driver would be a never ending story,
    therefore just disable COMPILE_TEST for s390.
    
    The reasoning is more or less the same as described in
    commit bc083a64b6c0 ("init/Kconfig: make COMPILE_TEST depend on !UML").

    init/Kconfig: make COMPILE_TEST depend on !UML
    
    commit bc083a64b6c035135c0f80718f9e9192cc0867c6 upstream.
    
    UML is a bit special since it does not have iomem nor dma.  That means a
    lot of drivers will not build if they miss a dependency on HAS_IOMEM.
    s390 used to have the same issues but since it gained PCI support UML is
    the only stranger.
    
    We are tired of patching dozens of new drivers after every merge window
    just to un-break allmod/yesconfig UML builds.  One could argue that a
    decent driver has to know on what it depends and therefore a missing
    HAS_IOMEM dependency is a clear driver bug.  But the dependency not
    obvious and not everyone does UML builds with COMPILE_TEST enabled when
    developing a device driver.
    
    A possible solution to make these builds succeed on UML would be
    providing stub functions for ioremap() and friends which fail upon
    runtime.  Another one is simply disabling COMPILE_TEST for UML.  Since
    it is the least hassle and does not force use to fake iomem support
    let's do the latter.

    tracing: Add a vmalloc_sync_mappings() for safe measure
    
    commit 11f5efc3ab66284f7aaacc926e9351d658e2577b upstream
    
    x86_64 lazily maps in the vmalloc pages, and the way this works with per_cpu
    areas can be complex, to say the least. Mappings may happen at boot up, and
    if nothing synchronizes the page tables, those page mappings may not be
    synced till they are used. This causes issues for anything that might touch
    one of those mappings in the path of the page fault handler. When one of
    those unmapped mappings is touched in the page fault handler, it will cause
    another page fault, which in turn will cause a page fault, and leave us in
    a loop of page faults.
    
    Commit 763802b53a42 ("x86/mm: split vmalloc_sync_all()") split
    vmalloc_sync_all() into vmalloc_sync_unmappings() and
    vmalloc_sync_mappings(), as on system exit, it did not need to do a full
    sync on x86_64 (although it still needed to be done on x86_32). By chance,
    the vmalloc_sync_all() would synchronize the page mappings done at boot up
    and prevent the per cpu area from being a problem for tracing in the page
    fault handler. But when that synchronization in the exit of a task became a
    nop, it caused the problem to appear.

    commit c5be12e45940f1aa1b5dfa04db5d15ad24f7c896 upstream
    
    Not sure nand_cleanup() is the right function to call here but in any
    case it is not nand_release(). Indeed, even a comment says that
    calling nand_release() is a bit of a hack as there is no MTD device to
    unregister. So switch to nand_cleanup() for now and drop this
    comment.
    
    There is no Fixes tag applying here as the use of nand_release()
    in this driver predates by far the introduction of nand_cleanup() in
    commit d44154f969a4 ("mtd: nand: Provide nand_cleanup() function to free NAND related resources")
    which makes this change possible. However, pointing this commit as the
    culprit for backporting purposes makes sense even if it did not intruce
    any bug.

    bpf, x86: Validate computation of branch displacements for x86-64
    
    commit e4d4d456436bfb2fe412ee2cd489f7658449b098 upstream.
    
    The branch displacement logic in the BPF JIT compilers for x86 assumes
    that, for any generated branch instruction, the distance cannot
    increase between optimization passes.
    
    But this assumption can be violated due to how the distances are
    computed. Specifically, whenever a backward branch is processed in
    do_jit(), the distance is computed by subtracting the positions in the
    machine code from different optimization passes. This is because part
    of addrs[] is already updated for the current optimization pass, before
    the branch instruction is visited.
    
    And so the optimizer can expand blocks of machine code in some cases.
    
    This can confuse the optimizer logic, where it assumes that a fixed
    point has been reached for all machine code blocks once the total
    program size stops changing. And then the JIT compiler can output
    abnormal machine code containing incorrect branch displacements.
    
    To mitigate this issue, we assert that a fixed point is reached while
    populating the output image. This rejects any problematic programs.
    The issue affects both x86-32 and x86-64. We mitigate separately to
    ease backporting.

    cifs: Silently ignore unknown oplock break handle
    
    [ Upstream commit 219481a8f90ec3a5eed9638fb35609e4b1aeece7 ]
    
    Make SMB2 not print out an error when an oplock break is received for an
    unknown handle, similar to SMB1.  The debug message which is printed for
    these unknown handles may also be misleading, so fix that too.
    
    The SMB2 lease break path is not affected by this patch.
    
    Without this, a program which writes to a file from one thread, and
    opens, reads, and writes the same file from another thread triggers the
    below errors several times a minute when run against a Samba server
    configured with "smb2 leases = no".

    cifs: revalidate mapping when we open files for SMB1 POSIX
    
    [ Upstream commit cee8f4f6fcabfdf229542926128e9874d19016d5 ]
    
    RHBZ: 1933527
    
    Under SMB1 + POSIX, if an inode is reused on a server after we have read and
    cached a part of a file, when we then open the new file with the
    re-cycled inode there is a chance that we may serve the old data out of cache
    to the application.
    This only happens for SMB1 (deprecated) and when posix are used.
    The simplest solution to avoid this race is to force a revalidate
    on smb1-posix open.

    pxa168_eth_remove() firstly calls unregister_netdev(),
    then cancels a timeout work. unregister_netdev() shuts down a device
    interface and removes it from the kernel tables. If the timeout occurs
    in parallel, the timeout work (pxa168_eth_tx_timeout_task) performs stop
    and open of the device. It may lead to an inconsistent state and memory
    leaks.
