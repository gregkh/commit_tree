    Revert: "crypto: af_alg - Disallow bind/setkey/... after accept(2)"
    
    This reverts commit 5a707f0972e1c9d8a4a921ddae79d0f9dc36a341 which is
    commit c840ac6af3f8713a71b4d2363419145760bd6044 upstream.
    
    It's been widely reported that this patch breaks existing userspace
    applications when backported to the stable kernel releases.  As no fix
    seems to be forthcoming, just revert it to let systems work again.

    modules: fix longstanding /proc/kallsyms vs module insertion race.
    
    commit 8244062ef1e54502ef55f54cced659913f244c3e upstream.
    
    For CONFIG_KALLSYMS, we keep two symbol tables and two string tables.
    There's one full copy, marked SHF_ALLOC and laid out at the end of the
    module's init section.  There's also a cut-down version that only
    contains core symbols and strings, and lives in the module's core
    section.
    
    After module init (and before we free the module memory), we switch
    the mod->symtab, mod->num_symtab and mod->strtab to point to the core
    versions.  We do this under the module_mutex.
    
    However, kallsyms doesn't take the module_mutex: it uses
    preempt_disable() and rcu tricks to walk through the modules, because
    it's used in the oops path.  It's also used in /proc/kallsyms.
    There's nothing atomic about the change of these variables, so we can
    get the old (larger!) num_symtab and the new symtab pointer; in fact
    this is what I saw when trying to reproduce.
    
    By grouping these variables together, we can use a
    carefully-dereferenced pointer to ensure we always get one or the
    other (the free of the module init section is already done in an RCU
    callback, so that's safe).  We allocate the init one at the end of the
    module init section, and keep the core one inside the struct module
    itself (it could also have been allocated at the end of the module
    core, but that's probably overkill).
    
    [ Rebased for 4.4-stable and older, because the following changes aren't
      in the older trees:
      - e0224418516b4d8a6c2160574bac18447c354ef0: adds arg to is_core_symbol

    commit a68075908a37850918ad96b056acc9ac4ce1bd90 upstream.
    
    The comparisons should be >= since 0x800 and 0x80 require an additional bit
    to store.
    
    For the 3 byte case, the existing shift would drop off 2 more bits than
    intended.

    efi: Add pstore variables to the deletion whitelist
    
    commit e246eb568bc4cbbdd8a30a3c11151ff9b7ca7312 upstream.
    
    Laszlo explains why this is a good idea,
    
     'This is because the pstore filesystem can be backed by UEFI variables,
      and (for example) a crash might dump the last kilobytes of the dmesg
      into a number of pstore entries, each entry backed by a separate UEFI
      variable in the above GUID namespace, and with a variable name
      according to the above pattern.
    
      Please see "drivers/firmware/efi/efi-pstore.c".
    
      While this patch series will not prevent the user from deleting those
      UEFI variables via the pstore filesystem (i.e., deleting a pstore fs
      entry will continue to delete the backing UEFI variable), I think it
      would be nice to preserve the possibility for the sysadmin to delete
      Linux-created UEFI variables that carry portions of the crash log,
      *without* having to mount the pstore filesystem.'
    
    There's also no chance of causing machines to become bricked by
    deleting these variables, which is the whole purpose of excluding
    things from the whitelist.
    
    Use the LINUX_EFI_CRASH_GUID guid and a wildcard '*' for the match so
    that we don't have to update the string in the future if new variable
    name formats are created for crash dump variables.

    efi: Make efivarfs entries immutable by default
    
    commit ed8b0de5a33d2a2557dce7f9429dca8cb5bc5879 upstream.
    
    "rm -rf" is bricking some peoples' laptops because of variables being
    used to store non-reinitializable firmware driver data that's required
    to POST the hardware.
    
    These are 100% bugs, and they need to be fixed, but in the mean time it
    shouldn't be easy to *accidentally* brick machines.
    
    We have to have delete working, and picking which variables do and don't
    work for deletion is quite intractable, so instead make everything
    immutable by default (except for a whitelist), and make tools that
    aren't quite so broad-spectrum unset the immutable flag.

    commit 8282f5d9c17fe15a9e658c06e3f343efae1a2a2f upstream.
    
    All the variables in this list so far are defined to be in the global

    validating the variables we think we are.

    KVM: x86: move steal time initialization to vcpu entry time
    
    commit 7cae2bedcbd4680b155999655e49c27b9cf020fa upstream.
    
    As reported at https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1494350,
    it is possible to have vcpu->arch.st.last_steal initialized
    from a thread other than vcpu thread, say the iothread, via
    KVM_SET_MSRS.
    
    Which can cause an overflow later (when subtracting from vcpu threads
    sched_info.run_delay).
    
    To avoid that, move steal time accumulation to vcpu entry time,
    before copying steal time data to guest.

    commit f15838e9cac8f78f0cc506529bb9d3b9fa589c1f upstream.
    
    Since binutils 2.26 BFD is doing suffix merging on STRTAB sections.  But
    dedotify modifies the symbol names in place, which can also modify
    unrelated symbols with a name that matches a suffix of a dotted name.  To
    remove the leading dot of a symbol name we can just increment the pointer
    into the STRTAB section instead.
    
    Backport to all stables to avoid breakage when people update their
    binutils - mpe.

    mac80211: minstrel_ht: set default tx aggregation timeout to 0
    
    commit 7a36b930e6ed4702c866dc74a5ad07318a57c688 upstream.
    
    The value 5000 was put here with the addition of the timeout field to
    ieee80211_start_tx_ba_session. It was originally added in mac80211 to
    save resources for drivers like iwlwifi, which only supports a limited
    number of concurrent aggregation sessions.
    
    Since iwlwifi does not use minstrel_ht and other drivers don't need
    this, 0 is a better default - especially since there have been
    recent reports of aggregation setup related issues reproduced with
    ath9k. This should improve stability without causing any adverse
    effects.

    wext: fix message delay/ordering
    
    commit 8bf862739a7786ae72409220914df960a0aa80d8 upstream.
    
    Beniamino reported that he was getting an RTM_NEWLINK message for a
    given interface, after the RTM_DELLINK for it. It turns out that the
    message is a wireless extensions message, which was sent because the
    interface had been connected and disconnection while it was deleted
    caused a wext message.
    
    For its netlink messages, wext uses RTM_NEWLINK, but the message is
    without all the regular rtnetlink attributes, so "ip monitor link"
    prints just rudimentary information:
    
    5: wlan1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN group default
        link/ether 02:00:00:00:01:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    Deleted 5: wlan1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default
        link/ether 02:00:00:00:01:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    5: wlan1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP>
        link/ether
    (from my hwsim reproduction)
    
    This can cause userspace to get confused since it doesn't expect an
    RTM_NEWLINK message after RTM_DELLINK.
    
    The reason for this is that wext schedules a worker to send out the
    messages, and the scheduling delay can cause the messages to get out
    to userspace in different order.
    
    To fix this, have wext register a netdevice notifier and flush out
    any pending messages when netdevice state changes. This fixes any
    ordering whenever the original message wasn't sent by a notifier
    itself.

    are not enabled to catch possible RCU issues that would only be triggered if
    a trace event was enabled. Commit f37755490fe9b only stopped the warnings
    when the trace event was enabled but did not prevent warnings if the trace
    event was called when disabled.
    
    To fix this, the cpu online check is moved to where the condition is added
    to the trace event. This will place the cpu online check in all places that
    it may be used now and in the future.

    KVM: VMX: disable PEBS before a guest entry
    
    commit 7099e2e1f4d9051f31bbfa5803adf954bb5d76ef upstream.
    
    Linux guests on Haswell (and also SandyBridge and Broadwell, at least)
    would crash if you decided to run a host command that uses PEBS, like
      perf record -e 'cpu/mem-stores/pp' -a
    
    This happens because KVM is using VMX MSR switching to disable PEBS, but
    SDM [2015-12] 18.4.4.4 Re-configuring PEBS Facilities explains why it
    isn't safe:
      When software needs to reconfigure PEBS facilities, it should allow a
      quiescent period between stopping the prior event counting and setting
      up a new PEBS event. The quiescent period is to allow any latent
      residual PEBS records to complete its capture at their previously
      specified buffer address (provided by IA32_DS_AREA).
    
    There might not be a quiescent period after the MSR switch, so a CPU
    ends up using host's MSR_IA32_DS_AREA to access an area in guest's
    memory.  (Or MSR switching is just buggy on some models.)
    
    The guest can learn something about the host this way:
    If the guest doesn't map address pointed by MSR_IA32_DS_AREA, it results
    in #PF where we leak host's MSR_IA32_DS_AREA through CR2.
    
    After that, a malicious guest can map and configure memory where
    MSR_IA32_DS_AREA is pointing and can therefore get an output from
    host's tracing.
    
    This is not a critical leak as the host must initiate with PEBS tracing
    and I have not been able to get a record from more than one instruction
    before vmentry in vmx_vcpu_run() (that place has most registers already
    overwritten with guest's).
    
    We could disable PEBS just few instructions before vmentry, but
    disabling it earlier shouldn't affect host tracing too much.
    We also don't need to switch MSR_IA32_PEBS_ENABLE on VMENTRY, but that
    optimization isn't worth its code, IMO.
    
    (If you are implementing PEBS for guests, be sure to handle the case
     where both host and guest enable PEBS, because this patch doesn't.)
