    powerpc: Make sure "cache" directory is removed when offlining cpu
    
    commit 91b973f90c1220d71923e7efe1e61f5329806380 upstream.
    
    The code in remove_cache_dir() is supposed to remove the "cache"
    subdirectory from the sysfs directory for a CPU when that CPU is
    being offlined.  It tries to do this by calling kobject_put() on
    the kobject for the subdirectory.  However, the subdirectory only
    gets removed once the last reference goes away, and the reference
    being put here may well not be the last reference.  That means
    that the "cache" subdirectory may still exist when the offlining
    operation has finished.  If the same CPU subsequently gets onlined,
    the code tries to add a new "cache" subdirectory.  If the old
    subdirectory has not yet been removed, we get a WARN_ON in the
    sysfs code, with stack trace, and an error message printed on the
    console.  Further, we ultimately end up with an online cpu with no
    "cache" subdirectory.
    
    This fixes it by doing an explicit kobject_del() at the point where
    we want the subdirectory to go away.  kobject_del() removes the sysfs
    directory even though the object still exists in memory.  The object
    will get freed at some point in the future.  A subsequent onlining
    operation can create a new sysfs directory, even if the old object
    still exists in memory, without causing any problems.

    powerpc: Fix the setup of CPU-to-Node mappings during CPU online
    
    commit d4edc5b6c480a0917e61d93d55531d7efa6230be upstream.
    
    On POWER platforms, the hypervisor can notify the guest kernel about dynamic
    changes in the cpu-numa associativity (VPHN topology update). Hence the
    cpu-to-node mappings that we got from the firmware during boot, may no longer
    be valid after such updates. This is handled using the arch_update_cpu_topology()
    hook in the scheduler, and the sched-domains are rebuilt according to the new
    mappings.
    
    But unfortunately, at the moment, CPU hotplug ignores these updated mappings
    and instead queries the firmware for the cpu-to-numa relationships and uses
    them during CPU online. So the kernel can end up assigning wrong NUMA nodes
    to CPUs during subsequent CPU hotplug online operations (after booting).
    
    Further, a particularly problematic scenario can result from this bug:
    On POWER platforms, the SMT mode can be switched between 1, 2, 4 (and even 8)
    threads per core. The switch to Single-Threaded (ST) mode is performed by
    offlining all except the first CPU thread in each core. Switching back to
    SMT mode involves onlining those other threads back, in each core.
    
    Now consider this scenario:
    
    1. During boot, the kernel gets the cpu-to-node mappings from the firmware
       and assigns the CPUs to NUMA nodes appropriately, during CPU online.
    
    2. Later on, the hypervisor updates the cpu-to-node mappings dynamically and
       communicates this update to the kernel. The kernel in turn updates its
       cpu-to-node associations and rebuilds its sched domains. Everything is
       fine so far.
    
    3. Now, the user switches the machine from SMT to ST mode (say, by running
       ppc64_cpu --smt=1). This involves offlining all except 1 thread in each
       core.
    
    4. The user then tries to switch back from ST to SMT mode (say, by running
       ppc64_cpu --smt=4), and this involves onlining those threads back. Since
       CPU hotplug ignores the new mappings, it queries the firmware and tries to
       associate the newly onlined sibling threads to the old NUMA nodes. This
       results in sibling threads within the same core getting associated with
       different NUMA nodes, which is incorrect.
    
       The scheduler's build-sched-domains code gets thoroughly confused with this
       and enters an infinite loop and causes soft-lockups, as explained in detail
       in commit 3be7db6ab (powerpc: VPHN topology change updates all siblings).
    
    So to fix this, use the numa_cpu_lookup_table to remember the updated
    cpu-to-node mappings, and use them during CPU hotplug online operations.
    Further, we also need to ensure that all threads in a core are assigned to a
    common NUMA node, irrespective of whether all those threads were online during
    the topology update. To achieve this, we take care not to use cpu_sibling_mask()
    since it is not hotplug invariant. Instead, we use cpu_first_sibling_thread()
    and set up the mappings manually using the 'threads_per_core' value for that
    particular platform. This helps us ensure that we don't hit this bug with any
    combination of CPU hotplug and SMT mode switching.

    btrfs: restrict snapshotting to own subvolumes
    
    commit d024206133ce21936b3d5780359afc00247655b7 upstream.
    
    Currently, any user can snapshot any subvolume if the path is accessible and
    thus indirectly create and keep files he does not own under his direcotries.
    This is not possible with traditional directories.
    
    In security context, a user can snapshot root filesystem and pin any
    potentially buggy binaries, even if the updates are applied.
    
    All the snapshots are visible to the administrator, so it's possible to
    verify if there are suspicious snapshots.
    
    Another more practical problem is that any user can pin the space used
    by eg. root and cause ENOSPC.

    target/iscsi: Fix network portal creation race
    
    commit ee291e63293146db64668e8d65eb35c97e8324f4 upstream.
    
    When creating network portals rapidly, such as when restoring a
    configuration, LIO's code to reuse existing portals can return a false
    negative if the thread hasn't run yet and set np_thread_state to
    ISCSI_NP_THREAD_ACTIVE. This causes an error in the network stack
    when attempting to bind to the same address/port.
    
    This patch sets NP_THREAD_ACTIVE before the np is placed on g_np_list,
    so even if the thread hasn't run yet, iscsit_get_np will return the
    existing np.
    
    Also, convert np_lock -> np_mutex + hold across adding new net portal
    to g_np_list to prevent a race where two threads may attempt to create
    the same network portal, resulting in one of them failing.

    Bfa driver crash is observed while pushing the firmware on to chinook
    quad port card due to uninitialized bfi_image_ct2 access which gets
    initialized only for CT2 ASIC based cards after request_firmware().
    For quard port chinook (CT2 ASIC based), bfi_image_ct2 is not getting
    initialized as there is no check for chinook PCI device ID before
    request_firmware and instead bfi_image_cb is initialized as it is the

    iwlwifi: pcie: fix interrupt coalescing for 7260 / 3160
    
    commit 6960a059b2c618f32fe549f13287b3d2278c09e9 upstream.
    
    We changed the timeout for the interrupt coealescing for
    calibration, but that wasn't effective since we changed
    that value back before loading the firmware. Since
    calibrations are notification from firmware and not Rx
    packets, this doesn't change anyway - the firmware will
    fire an interrupt straight away regardless of the interrupt
    coalescing value.
    Also, a HW issue has been discovered in 7000 devices series.
    The work around is to disable the new interrupt coalescing
    timeout feature - do this by setting bit 31 in
    CSR_INT_COALESCING.
    This has been fixed in 7265 which means that we can't rely
    on the device family and must have a hint in the iwl_cfg
    structure.

    ALSA: hda/hdmi - allow PIN_OUT to be dynamically enabled
    
    (This is upstream 75fae117a5db "ALSA: hda/hdmi - allow PIN_OUT to be
    dynamically enabled", backported to stable 3.10 through 3.12. 3.13 and
    later can take the original patch.)
    
    Commit 384a48d71520 "ALSA: hda: HDMI: Support codecs with fewer cvts
    than pins" dynamically enabled each pin widget's PIN_OUT only when the
    pin was actively in use. This was required on certain NVIDIA CODECs for
    correct operation. Specifically, if multiple pin widgets each had their
    mux input select the same audio converter widget and each pin widget had
    PIN_OUT enabled, then only one of the pin widgets would actually receive
    the audio, and often not the one the user wanted!
    
    However, this apparently broke some Intel systems, and commit
    6169b673618b "ALSA: hda - Always turn on pins for HDMI/DP" reverted the
    dynamic setting of PIN_OUT. This in turn broke the afore-mentioned NVIDIA
    CODECs.
    
    This change supports either dynamic or static handling of PIN_OUT,
    selected by a flag set up during CODEC initialization. This flag is
    enabled for all recent NVIDIA GPUs.

    commit 2d93aee152b1758a94a18fe15d72153ba73b5679 upstream.
    
    Enabling the oscillator consumes slightly more power (100uA)
    but allows to make sure that we exit from L1 on time.
    
    Not doing so might lead to a PCIe specification violation
    since we might wake up from L1 at the wrong time.
    This issue has been identified on 3160 and 7260 only.
    On older NICs L1 off is not enabled, on newer NICs (7265),
    the issue is fixed.
    
    When the bug occurs the user sees that the NIC has
    disappeared from the PCI bridge, any access to the device
    returns 0xff.

    ip6tnl: fix double free of fb_tnl_dev on exit
    
    [ No relevant upstream commit. ]
    
    This problem was fixed upstream by commit 1e9f3d6f1c40 ("ip6tnl: fix use after
    free of fb_tnl_dev").
    The upstream patch depends on upstream commit 0bd8762824e7 ("ip6tnl: add x-netns
    support"), which was not backported into 3.10 branch.
    
    First, explain the problem: when the ip6_tunnel module is unloaded,
    ip6_tunnel_cleanup() is called.
    rmmod ip6_tunnel
    => ip6_tunnel_cleanup()
      => rtnl_link_unregister()
        => __rtnl_kill_links()
          => for_each_netdev(net, dev) {
            if (dev->rtnl_link_ops == ops)
                    ops->dellink(dev, &list_kill);
            }
    At this point, the FB device is deleted (and all ip6tnl tunnels).
      => unregister_pernet_device()
        => unregister_pernet_operations()
          => ops_exit_list()
            => ip6_tnl_exit_net()
              => ip6_tnl_destroy_tunnels()
                => t = rtnl_dereference(ip6n->tnls_wc[0]);
                   unregister_netdevice_queue(t->dev, &list);
    We delete the FB device a second time here!
    
    The previous fix removes these lines, which fix this double free. But the patch
    introduces a memory leak when a netns is destroyed, because the FB device is
    never deleted. By adding an rtnl ops which delete all ip6tnl device excepting
    the FB device, we can keep this exlicit removal in ip6_tnl_destroy_tunnels().

    sit: fix double free of fb_tunnel_dev on exit
    
    [ No relevant upstream commit. ]
    
    This problem was fixed upstream by commit 9434266f2c64 ("sit: fix use after free
    of fb_tunnel_dev").
    The upstream patch depends on upstream commit 5e6700b3bf98 ("sit: add support of
    x-netns"), which was not backported into 3.10 branch.
    
    First, explain the problem: when the sit module is unloaded, sit_cleanup() is
    called.
    rmmod sit
    => sit_cleanup()
      => rtnl_link_unregister()
        => __rtnl_kill_links()
          => for_each_netdev(net, dev) {
            if (dev->rtnl_link_ops == ops)
                    ops->dellink(dev, &list_kill);
            }
    At this point, the FB device is deleted (and all sit tunnels).
      => unregister_pernet_device()
        => unregister_pernet_operations()
          => ops_exit_list()
            => sit_exit_net()
              => sit_destroy_tunnels()
              In this function, no tunnel is found.
              => unregister_netdevice_queue(sitn->fb_tunnel_dev, &list);
    We delete the FB device a second time here!
    
    Because we cannot simply remove the second deletion (sit_exit_net() must remove
    the FB device when a netns is deleted), we add an rtnl ops which delete all sit
    device excepting the FB device and thus we can keep the explicit deletion in
    sit_exit_net().

    xen-netfront: fix resource leak in netfront
    
    [ Upstream commit cefe0078eea52af17411eb1248946a94afb84ca5 ]
    
    This patch removes grant transfer releasing code from netfront, and uses
    gnttab_end_foreign_access to end grant access since
    gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref may fail when the grant entry is
    currently used for reading or writing.
    
    * clean up grant transfer code kept from old netfront(2.6.18) which grants
    pages for access/map and transfer. But grant transfer is deprecated in current
    netfront, so remove corresponding release code for transfer.
    
    * fix resource leak, release grant access (through gnttab_end_foreign_access)
    and skb for tx/rx path, use get_page to ensure page is released when grant
    access is completed successfully.
    
    Xen-blkfront/xen-tpmfront/xen-pcifront also have similar issue, but patches
    for them will be created separately.
    
    V6: Correct subject line and commit message.
    
    V5: Remove unecessary change in xennet_end_access.
    
    V4: Revert put_page in gnttab_end_foreign_access, and keep netfront change in
    single patch.
    
    V3: Changes as suggestion from David Vrabel, ensure pages are not freed untill
    grant acess is ended.
    
    V2: Improve patch comments.

    net: Fix memory leak if TPROXY used with TCP early demux
    
    [ Upstream commit a452ce345d63ddf92cd101e4196569f8718ad319 ]

    But there are many more, resulting in the machine going OOM after some
    days.
    
    From looking at the TPROXY code, and with help from Florian, I see
    that the memory leak is introduced in tcp_v4_early_demux():
    
      void tcp_v4_early_demux(struct sk_buff *skb)
      {
        /* ... */
    
        iph = ip_hdr(skb);
        th = tcp_hdr(skb);
    
        if (th->doff < sizeof(struct tcphdr) / 4)
            return;
    
        sk = __inet_lookup_established(dev_net(skb->dev), &tcp_hashinfo,
                           iph->saddr, th->source,
                           iph->daddr, ntohs(th->dest),
                           skb->skb_iif);
        if (sk) {
            skb->sk = sk;
    
    where the socket is assigned unconditionally to skb->sk, also bumping
    the refcnt on it.  This is problematic, because in our case the skb
    has already a socket assigned in the TPROXY target.  This then results
    in the leak I see.
    
    The very same issue seems to be with IPv6, but haven't tested.

    s390/bpf,jit: fix 32 bit divisions, use unsigned divide instructions
    
    [ Upstream commit 3af57f78c38131b7a66e2b01e06fdacae01992a3 ]
    
    The s390 bpf jit compiler emits the signed divide instructions "dr" and "d"
    for unsigned divisions.
    This can cause problems: the dividend will be zero extended to a 64 bit value
    and the divisor is the 32 bit signed value as specified A or X accumulator,
    even though A and X are supposed to be treated as unsigned values.
    
    The divide instrunctions will generate an exception if the result cannot be
    expressed with a 32 bit signed value.
    This is the case if e.g. the dividend is 0xffffffff and the divisor either 1
    or also 0xffffffff (signed: -1).
    
    To avoid all these issues simply use unsigned divide instructions.

    [ Upstream commit aee636c4809fa54848ff07a899b326eb1f9987a2 ]
    
    At first Jakub Zawadzki noticed that some divisions by reciprocal_divide
    were not correct. (off by one in some cases)
    http://www.wireshark.org/~darkjames/reciprocal-buggy.c
    
    He could also show this with BPF:
    http://www.wireshark.org/~darkjames/set-and-dump-filter-k-bug.c
    
    The reciprocal divide in linux kernel is not generic enough,
    lets remove its use in BPF, as it is not worth the pain with
    current cpus.

    tcp: metrics: Avoid duplicate entries with the same destination-IP
    
    [ Upstream commit 77f99ad16a07aa062c2d30fae57b1fee456f6ef6 ]
    
    Because the tcp-metrics is an RCU-list, it may be that two
    soft-interrupts are inside __tcp_get_metrics() for the same
    destination-IP at the same time. If this destination-IP is not yet part of
    the tcp-metrics, both soft-interrupts will end up in tcpm_new and create
    a new entry for this IP.
    So, we will have two tcp-metrics with the same destination-IP in the list.
    
    This patch checks twice __tcp_get_metrics(). First without holding the
    lock, then while holding the lock. The second one is there to confirm
    that the entry has not been added by another soft-irq while waiting for
    the spin-lock.

    net: avoid reference counter overflows on fib_rules in multicast forwarding
    
    [ Upstream commit 95f4a45de1a0f172b35451fc52283290adb21f6e ]
    
    Bob Falken reported that after 4G packets, multicast forwarding stopped
    working. This was because of a rule reference counter overflow which
    freed the rule as soon as the overflow happend.
    
    This patch solves this by adding the FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF flag to
    fib_rules_lookup calls. This is safe even from non-rcu locked sections
    as in this case the flag only implies not taking a reference to the rule,
    which we don't need at all.
    
    Rules only hold references to the namespace, which are guaranteed to be
    available during the call of the non-rcu protected function reg_vif_xmit
    because of the interface reference which itself holds a reference to
    the net namespace.

    inet_diag: fix inet_diag_dump_icsk() timewait socket state logic
    
    [ Based upon upstream commit 70315d22d3c7383f9a508d0aab21e2eb35b2303a ]
    
    Fix inet_diag_dump_icsk() to reflect the fact that both TIME_WAIT and
    FIN_WAIT2 connections are represented by inet_timewait_sock (not just
    TIME_WAIT). Thus:
    
    (a) We need to iterate through the time_wait buckets if the user wants
    either TIME_WAIT or FIN_WAIT2. (Before fixing this, "ss -nemoi state
    fin-wait-2" would not return any sockets, even if there were some in
    FIN_WAIT2.)
    
    (b) We need to check tw_substate to see if the user wants to dump
    sockets in the particular substate (TIME_WAIT or FIN_WAIT2) that a
    given connection is in. (Before fixing this, "ss -nemoi state
    time-wait" would actually return sockets in state FIN_WAIT2.)
    
    An analogous fix is in v3.13: 70315d22d3c7383f9a508d0aab21e2eb35b2303a
    ("inet_diag: fix inet_diag_dump_icsk() to use correct state for
    timewait sockets") but that patch is quite different because 3.13 code
    is very different in this area due to the unification of TCP hash
    tables in 05dbc7b ("tcp/dccp: remove twchain") in v3.13-rc1.
    
    I tested that this applies cleanly between v3.3 and v3.12, and tested
    that it works in both 3.3 and 3.12. It does not apply cleanly to 3.2
    and earlier (though it makes semantic sense), and semantically is not
    the right fix for 3.13 and beyond (as mentioned above).

    bnx2x: fix DMA unmapping of TSO split BDs
    
    [ Upstream commit 95e92fd40c967c363ad66b2fd1ce4dcd68132e54 ]
    
    bnx2x triggers warnings with CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG=y:
    
      WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2253 at lib/dma-debug.c:887 check_unmap+0xf8/0x920()
      bnx2x 0000:28:00.0: DMA-API: device driver frees DMA memory with
      different size [device address=0x00000000da2b389e] [map size=1490 bytes]
      [unmap size=66 bytes]
    
    The reason is that bnx2x splits a TSO BD into two BDs (headers + data)
    using one DMA mapping for both, but it uses only the length of the first
    BD when unmapping.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by unmapping the whole length of the two BDs.

    bcache: Data corruption fix
    
    commit ef71ec00002d92a08eb27e9d036e3d48835b6597 upstream.
    
    The code that handles overlapping extents that we've just read back in from disk
    was depending on the behaviour of the code that handles overlapping extents as
    we're inserting into a btree node in the case of an insert that forced an
    existing extent to be split: on insert, if we had to split we'd also insert a
    new extent to represent the top part of the old extent - and then that new
    extent would get written out.
    
    The code that read the extents back in thus not bother with splitting extents -
    if it saw an extent that ovelapped in the middle of an older extent, it would
    trim the old extent to only represent the bottom part, assuming that the
    original insert would've inserted a new extent to represent the top part.
    
    I still haven't figured out _how_ it can happen, but I'm now pretty convinced
    (and testing has confirmed) that there's some kind of an obscure corner case
    (probably involving extent merging, and multiple overwrites in different sets)
    that breaks this. The fix is to change the mergesort fixup code to split extents
    itself when required.

    libata: disable LPM for some WD SATA-I devices
    
    commit ecd75ad514d73efc1bbcc5f10a13566c3ace5f53 upstream.
    
    For some reason, some early WD drives spin up and down drives
    erratically when the link is put into slumber mode which can reduce
    the life expectancy of the device significantly.  Unfortunately, we
    don't have full list of devices and given the nature of the issue it'd
    be better to err on the side of false positives than the other way
    around.  Let's disable LPM on all WD devices which match one of the
    known problematic model prefixes and are SATA-I.
    
    As horkage list doesn't support matching SATA capabilities, this is
    implemented as two horkages - WD_BROKEN_LPM and NOLPM.  The former is
    set for the known prefixes and sets the latter if the matched device
    is SATA-I.
    
    Note that this isn't optimal as this disables all LPM operations and
    partial link power state reportedly works fine on these; however, the
    way LPM is implemented in libata makes it difficult to precisely map
    libata LPM setting to specific link power state.  Well, these devices
    are already fairly outdated.  Let's just disable whole LPM for now.

    Note that this fix is only applied if the compatible string
    "marvell,armada-370-sata" is found in the SATA DT node.

    tpm/tpm_i2c_stm_st33: Check return code of get_burstcount
    
    commit 85c5e0d451125c6ddb78663972e40af810b83644 upstream.
    
    The 'get_burstcount' function can in some circumstances 'return -EBUSY' which
    in tpm_stm_i2c_send is stored in an 'u32 burstcnt'
    thus converting the signed value into an unsigned value, resulting
    in 'burstcnt' being huge.
    Changing the type to u32 only does not solve the problem as the signed
    value is converted to an unsigned in I2C_WRITE_DATA, resulting in the
    same effect.
    
    Thus
    -> Change type of burstcnt to u32 (the return type of get_burstcount)
    -> Add a check for the return value of 'get_burstcount' and propagate a
    potential error.
    
    This makes also sense in the 'I2C_READ_DATA' case, where the there is no
    signed/unsigned conversion.

    Replace regmap_init_i2c() call in driver probe with initialization of
    managed register map so the regmap will be properly freed by the device
    management code.

    perf kvm: Fix kvm report without guestmount.
    
    commit ad85ace07a05062ef6b59c35a5e80b6eaee1eee6 upstream.
    
    Currently, if we use perf kvm --guestkallsyms --guestmodules report, we
    can not get the perf information from perf data file. All sample are
    shown as unknown.
    
    Reproducing steps:
            # perf kvm --guestkallsyms /tmp/kallsyms --guestmodules /tmp/modules record -a sleep 1
            [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
            [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.624 MB perf.data.guest (~27260 samples) ]
            # perf kvm --guestkallsyms /tmp/kallsyms --guestmodules /tmp/modules report |grep %
               100.00%  [guest/6471]  [unknown]         [g] 0xffffffff8164f330
    
    This bug was introduced by 207b57926 (perf kvm: Fix regression with guest machine creation).
    In original code, it uses perf_session__find_machine(), it means we deliver symbol to machine
    which has the same pid, if no machine found, deliver it to *default* guest. But if we use
    perf_session__findnew_machine() here, if no machine was found, new machine with pid will be built
    and added. Then the default guest which with pid == 0 will never get a symbol.
    
    And because the new machine initialized here has no kernel map created, the symbol delivered to
    it will be marked as "unknown".
    
    This patch here is to revert commit 207b57926 and fix the SEGFAULT bug in another way.
    
    Verification steps:
            # ./perf kvm --guestkallsyms /home/kallsyms --guestmodules /home/modules record -a sleep 1
            [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
            [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.651 MB perf.data.guest (~28437 samples) ]
            # ./perf kvm --guestkallsyms /home/kallsyms --guestmodules /home/modules report |grep %

    rtc: max8907: weekday encoding fixes
    
    commit 75ea799df4cb07e505c91b4abaa87bc28aad3e66 upstream.
    
    The current MAX8907 driver has two issues related to weekday value
    handling:
    
    1)
    
    The HW WEEKDAY register has range 0..6 rather than 1..7 as documented.
    Note that I validated the actual HW range by observing the HW register
    roll from 6->0 rather than 6->7->1 as would otherwise be expected.
    
    This matches Linux's tm_wday range of 0..6.
    
    When the CMOS RAM content is lost, the date returned from the device is
    2007-01-01 00:00:00, which is a Monday.  The WEEKDAY register reads 1 in
    this case.  This matches the numbering in Linux's tm_wday field.
    
    Hence we should write Linux's tm_wday value to the register without
    modifying it.  Hence, remove the +1/-1 calculations for WEEKDAY/tm_wday.
    
    2)
    
    There's no need to make alarms match on the WEEKDAY register, since the
    other fields together uniquely define the alarm date/time.  Ignoring the
    WEEKDAY value in the match isolates the driver from any incorrect value in
    the current time copy of the WEEKDAY register.
    
    Each change individually, or both together, solves an issue that I
    observed; "hwclock -r" would time out waiting for its alarm to fire if the
    CMOS RAM content had been lost, and hence the WEEKDAY register value
    mismatched what the driver expected it to be.  "hwclock -w" would solve
    this by over-writing the HW default WEEKDAY register value with what the
    driver expected.

    parport: parport_pc: remove double PCI ID for NetMos
    
    commit d6a484520c5572a4170fa915109ccfc0c38f5008 upstream.
    
    In commit 85747f ("PATCH] parport: add NetMOS 9805 support") Max added
    the PCI ID for NetMOS 9805 based on a Debian bug report from 2k4 which
    was at the v2.4.26 time frame. The patch made into 2.6.14.
    Shortly before that patch akpm merged commit 296d3c783b ("[PATCH] Support
    NetMOS based PCI cards providing serial and parallel ports") which made
    into v2.6.9-rc1.
    Now we have two different entries for the same PCI id.
    I have here the NetMos 9805 which claims to support SPP/EPP/ECP mode.
    This patch takes Max's entry for titan_1284p1 (base != -1 specifies the
    ioport for ECP mode) and replaces akpm's entry for netmos_9805 which
    specified -1 (=none). Both share the same PCI-ID (my card has subsystem
    0x1000 / 0x0020 so it should match PCI_ANY).
    
    While here I also drop the entry for titan_1284p2 which is the same as
    netmos_9815.

    serial: 8250: enable UART_BUG_NOMSR for Tegra
    
    commit 3685f19e07802ec4207b52465c408f185b66490e upstream.
    
    Tegra chips have 4 or 5 identical UART modules embedded. UARTs C..E have
    their MODEM-control signals tied off to a static state. However UARTs A
    and B can optionally route those signals to/from package pins, depending
    on the exact pinmux configuration.
    
    When these signals are not routed to package pins, false interrupts may
    trigger either temporarily, or permanently, all while not showing up in
    the IIR; it will read as NO_INT. This will eventually lead to the UART
    IRQ being disabled due to unhandled interrupts. When this happens, the
    kernel may print e.g.:
    
        irq 68: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)
    
    In order to prevent this, enable UART_BUG_NOMSR. This prevents
    UART_IER_MSI from being enabled, which prevents the false interrupts
    from triggering.
    
    In practice, this is not needed under any of the following conditions:
    
    * On Tegra chips after Tegra30, since the HW bug has apparently been
      fixed.
    
    * On UARTs C..E since their MODEM control signals are tied to the correct
      static state which doesn't trigger the issue.
    
    * On UARTs A..B if the MODEM control signals are routed out to package
      pins, since they will then carry valid signals.
    
    However, we ignore these exceptions for now, since they are only relevant
    if a board actually hooks up more than a 4-wire UART, and no currently
    supported board does this. If we ever support a board that does, we can
    refine the algorithm that enables UART_BUG_NOMSR to take those exceptions
    into account, and/or read a flag from DT/... that indicates that the
    board has hooked up and pinmux'd more than a 4-wire UART.

    b43: Fix unload oops if firmware is not available
    
    commit 0673effd41dba323d6a280ef37b5ef29f3f5a653 upstream.
    
    The asyncronous firmware load uses a completion struct to hold firmware
    processing until the user-space routines are up and running. There is.
    however, a problem in that the waiter is nevered canceled during teardown.
    As a result, unloading the driver when firmware is not available causes an oops.
    
    To be able to access the completion structure at teardown, it had to be moved
    into the b43_wldev structure.
    
    This patch also fixes a typo in a comment.

    b43: Fix lockdep splat
    
    commit 09164043f63c947a49797750a09ca1cd7c31108e upstream.
    
    In https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67561, a locking dependency is reported
    when b43 is used with hostapd, and rfkill is used to kill the radio output.
    
    The lockdep splat (in part) is as follows:
    
    ======================================================
    [ INFO: possible circular locking dependency detected ]
    3.12.0 #1 Not tainted
    -------------------------------------------------------
    rfkill/10040 is trying to acquire lock:
     (rtnl_mutex){+.+.+.}, at: [<ffffffff8146f282>] rtnl_lock+0x12/0x20
    
    but task is already holding lock:
     (rfkill_global_mutex){+.+.+.}, at: [<ffffffffa04832ca>] rfkill_fop_write+0x6a/0x170 [rfkill]
    
    --snip--
    
    Chain exists of:
      rtnl_mutex --> misc_mtx --> rfkill_global_mutex
    
    The fix is to move the initialization of the hardware random number generator
    outside the code range covered by the rtnl_mutex.

    these register save locations are now needed for USB drivers.

    usb: ehci: add freescale imx28 special write register method
    
    commit feffe09f510c475df082546815f9e4a573f6a233 upstream.
    
    According to Freescale imx28 Errata, "ENGR119653 USB: ARM to USB
    register error issue", All USB register write operations must
    use the ARM SWP instruction. So, we implement a special ehci_write
    for imx28.
    
    Discussion for it at below:
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=137996395529294&w=2
    
    Without this patcheset, imx28 works unstable at high AHB bus loading.
    If the bus loading is not high, the imx28 usb can work well at the most
    of time. There is a IC errata for this problem, usually, we consider
    IC errata is a problem not a new feature, and this workaround is needed
    for that, so we need to add them to stable tree 3.11+.

    USB: fix race between hub_disconnect and recursively_mark_NOTATTACHED
    
    commit 543d7784b07ffd16cc82a9cb4e1e0323fd0040f1 upstream.
    
    There is a race in the hub driver between hub_disconnect() and
    recursively_mark_NOTATTACHED().  This race can be triggered if the
    driver is unbound from a device at the same time as the bus's root hub
    is removed.  When the race occurs, it can cause an oops:

     [<c1264a30>] ? kthread_create_on_node+0xc0/0xc0
    
    One problem is that recursively_mark_NOTATTACHED() uses the intfdata
    value and hub->hdev->maxchild while hub_disconnect() is clearing them.
    Another problem is that it uses hub->ports[i] while the port device is
    being released.
    
    To fix this race, we need to hold the device_state_lock while
    hub_disconnect() changes the values.  (Note that usb_disconnect()
    and hub_port_connect_change() already acquire this lock at similar
    critical times during a USB device's life cycle.)  We also need to
    remove the port devices after maxchild has been set to 0, instead of
    before.

    USB: Nokia 502 is an unusual device
    
    commit 0e16114f2db4838251fb64f3b550996ad3585890 upstream.
    
    The USB storage operation of Nokia Asha 502 Dual SIM smartphone running Asha
    Platform 1.1.1 is unreliable in respect of data consistency (i.e. transfered
    files are corrupted). A similar issue is described here:
    http://discussions.nokia.com/t5/Asha-and-other-Nokia-Series-30/Nokia-301-USB-transfers-and-corrupted-files/td-p/1974170
    
    The workaround is (MAX_SECTORS_64):
       rmmod usb_storage && modprobe usb_storage quirks=0421:06aa:m
    
    The patch adds the tested device to the unusual list permanently.

    USB: ftdi_sio: added CS5 quirk for broken smartcard readers
    
    commit c1f15196ac3b541d084dc80a8fbd8a74c6a0bd44 upstream.
    
    Genuine FTDI chips support only CS7/8. A previous fix in commit
    8704211f65a2 ("USB: ftdi_sio: fixed handling of unsupported CSIZE
    setting") enforced this limitation and reported it back to userspace.
    
    However, certain types of smartcard readers depend on specific
    driver behaviour that requests 0 data bits (not 5) to change into a
    different operating mode if CS5 has been set.
    
    This patch reenables this behaviour for all FTDI devices.
    
    Tagged to be added to stable, because it affects a lot of users of
    embedded systems which rely on these readers to work properly.

    USB: pl2303: fix data corruption on termios updates
    
    commit 623c8263376c0b8a4b0c220232e7313d762cd0cc upstream.
    
    Some PL2303 devices are known to lose bytes if you change serial
    settings even to the same values as before. Avoid this by comparing the
    encoded settings with the previsouly used ones before configuring the
    device.
    
    The common case was fixed by commit bf5e5834bffc6 ("pl2303: Fix mode
    switching regression"), but this problem was still possible to trigger,
    for instance, by using the TCSETS2-interface to repeatedly request
    115201 baud, which gets mapped to 115200 and thus always triggers a
    settings update.

    x86, x32: Correct invalid use of user timespec in the kernel
    
    commit 2def2ef2ae5f3990aabdbe8a755911902707d268 upstream.
    
    The x32 case for the recvmsg() timout handling is broken:
    
      asmlinkage long compat_sys_recvmmsg(int fd, struct compat_mmsghdr __user *mmsg,
                                          unsigned int vlen, unsigned int flags,
                                          struct compat_timespec __user *timeout)
      {
              int datagrams;
              struct timespec ktspec;
    
              if (flags & MSG_CMSG_COMPAT)
                      return -EINVAL;
    
              if (COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME)
                      return __sys_recvmmsg(fd, (struct mmsghdr __user *)mmsg, vlen,
                                            flags | MSG_CMSG_COMPAT,
                                            (struct timespec *) timeout);
              ...
    
    The timeout pointer parameter is provided by userland (hence the __user
    annotation) but for x32 syscalls it's simply cast to a kernel pointer
    and is passed to __sys_recvmmsg which will eventually directly
    dereference it for both reading and writing.  Other callers to
    __sys_recvmmsg properly copy from userland to the kernel first.
    
    The bug was introduced by commit ee4fa23c4bfc ("compat: Use
    COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME in net/compat.c") and should affect all kernels
    since 3.4 (and perhaps vendor kernels if they backported x32 support
    along with this code).
    
    Note that CONFIG_X86_X32_ABI gets enabled at build time and only if
    CONFIG_X86_X32 is enabled and ld can build x32 executables.
    
    Other uses of COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME seem fine.
    
    This addresses CVE-2014-0038.

    mm/mempolicy.c: fix mempolicy printing in numa_maps
    
    commit 8790c71a18e5d2d93532ae250bcf5eddbba729cd upstream.
    
    As a result of commit 5606e3877ad8 ("mm: numa: Migrate on reference
    policy"), /proc/<pid>/numa_maps prints the mempolicy for any <pid> as
    "prefer:N" for the local node, N, of the process reading the file.
    
    This should only be printed when the mempolicy of <pid> is
    MPOL_PREFERRED for node N.
    
    If the process is actually only using the default mempolicy for local
    node allocation, make sure "default" is printed as expected.

    e1000e: fix compiler warnings
    
    commit 9e6c3b63399dd424d33a34e08b77f2cab0b84cdc upstream.
    
    This patch is to fix a compiler warning of __bad_udelay due to a value
    of >999 being passed as a parameter to udelay() in the function
    e1000e_phy_has_link_generic().  This affects the gcc compiler when
    it is given a flag of -O3 and the icc compiler.
    
    This patch is also making the change from mdelay() to msleep() in the
    same function, since it was determined though code inspection that this
    function is never called in atomic context.

    mm: hugetlbfs: fix hugetlbfs optimization
    
    commit 27c73ae759774e63313c1fbfeb17ba076cea64c5 upstream.
    
    Commit 7cb2ef56e6a8 ("mm: fix aio performance regression for database
    caused by THP") can cause dereference of a dangling pointer if
    split_huge_page runs during PageHuge() if there are updates to the
    tail_page->private field.
    
    Also it is repeating compound_head twice for hugetlbfs and it is running
    compound_head+compound_trans_head for THP when a single one is needed in
    both cases.
    
    The new code within the PageSlab() check doesn't need to verify that the
    THP page size is never bigger than the smallest hugetlbfs page size, to
    avoid memory corruption.
    
    A longstanding theoretical race condition was found while fixing the
    above (see the change right after the skip_unlock label, that is
    relevant for the compound_lock path too).
    
    By re-establishing the _mapcount tail refcounting for all compound
    pages, this also fixes the below problem:

    lib/decompressors: fix "no limit" output buffer length
    
    commit 1431574a1c4c669a0c198e4763627837416e4443 upstream.
    
    When decompressing into memory, the output buffer length is set to some
    arbitrarily high value (0x7fffffff) to indicate the output is, virtually,
    unlimited in size.
    
    The problem with this is that some platforms have their physical memory at
    high physical addresses (0x80000000 or more), and that the output buffer
    address and its "unlimited" length cannot be added without overflowing.
    An example of this can be found in inflate_fast():
    
    /* next_out is the output buffer address */
    out = strm->next_out - OFF;
    /* avail_out is the output buffer size. end will overflow if the output
     * address is >= 0x80000104 */
    end = out + (strm->avail_out - 257);
    
    This has huge consequences on the performance of kernel decompression,
    since the following exit condition of inflate_fast() will be always true:
    
    } while (in < last && out < end);
    
    Indeed, "end" has overflowed and is now always lower than "out".  As a
    result, inflate_fast() will return after processing one single byte of
    input data, and will thus need to be called an unreasonably high number of
    times.  This probably went unnoticed because kernel decompression is fast
    enough even with this issue.
    
    Nonetheless, adjusting the output buffer length in such a way that the
    above pointer arithmetic never overflows results in a kernel decompression
    that is about 3 times faster on affected machines.

    drm/nouveau/bios: fix offset calculation for BMPv1 bioses
    
    commit 5d2f4767c4eacab351b8450b0de4d3261fe1a957 upstream.
    
    The only BIOS on record that needs the 14 offset has a bios major
    version 2 but BMP version 1.01. Another bunch of BIOSes that need the 18
    offset have BMP version 2.01 or 5.01 or higher. So instead of looking at the
    bios major version, look at the BMP version. BIOSes with BMP version 0
    do not contain a detectable script, so always return 0 for them.

    md/raid5: fix long-standing problem with bitmap handling on write failure.
    
    commit 9f97e4b128d2ea90a5f5063ea0ee3b0911f4c669 upstream.
    
    Before a write starts we set a bit in the write-intent bitmap.
    When the write completes we clear that bit if the write was successful
    to all devices.  However if the write wasn't fully successful we
    should not clear the bit.  If the faulty drive is subsequently
    re-added, the fact that the bit is still set ensure that we will
    re-write the data that is missing.
    
    This logic is mediated by the STRIPE_DEGRADED flag - we only clear the
    bitmap bit when this flag is not set.
    Currently we correctly set the flag if a write starts when some
    devices are failed or missing.  But we do *not* set the flag if some
    device failed during the write attempt.
    This is wrong and can result in clearing the bit inappropriately.
    
    So: set the flag when a write fails.
    
    This bug has been present since bitmaps were introduces, so the fix is
    suitable for any -stable kernel.

    kvm: x86: fix apic_base enable check
    
    commit 0dce7cd67fd9055c4a2ff278f8af1431e646d346 upstream.
    
    Commit e66d2ae7c67bd moved the assignment
    vcpu->arch.apic_base = value above a condition with
    (vcpu->arch.apic_base ^ value), causing that check
    to always fail. Use old_value, vcpu->arch.apic_base's
    old value, in the condition instead.
