    KVM: arm64: Save the host's PtrAuth keys in non-preemptible context
    
    commit ef3e40a7ea8dbe2abd0a345032cd7d5023b9684f upstream.
    
    When using the PtrAuth feature in a guest, we need to save the host's
    keys before allowing the guest to program them. For that, we dump
    them in a per-CPU data structure (the so called host context).
    
    But both call sites that do this are in preemptible context,
    which may end up in disaster should the vcpu thread get preempted
    before reentering the guest.
    
    Instead, save the keys eagerly on each vcpu_load(). This has an
    increased overhead, but is at least safe.

    KVM: arm64: Synchronize sysreg state on injecting an AArch32 exception
    
    commit 0370964dd3ff7d3d406f292cb443a927952cbd05 upstream.
    
    On a VHE system, the EL1 state is left in the CPU most of the time,
    and only syncronized back to memory when vcpu_put() is called (most
    of the time on preemption).
    
    Which means that when injecting an exception, we'd better have a way
    to either:
    (1) write directly to the EL1 sysregs
    (2) synchronize the state back to memory, and do the changes there
    
    For an AArch64, we already do (1), so we are safe. Unfortunately,
    doing the same thing for AArch32 would be pretty invasive. Instead,
    we can easily implement (2) by calling the put/load architectural
    backends, and keep preemption disabled. We can then reload the
    state back into EL1.

    platform/x86: sony-laptop: SNC calls should handle BUFFER types
    
    commit 47828d22539f76c8c9dcf2a55f18ea3a8039d8ef upstream.
    
    After commit 6d232b29cfce ("ACPICA: Dispatcher: always generate buffer
    objects for ASL create_field() operator") ACPICA creates buffers even
    when new fields are small enough to fit into an integer.
    Many SNC calls counted on the old behaviour.
    Since sony-laptop already handles the INTEGER/BUFFER case in
    sony_nc_buffer_call, switch sony_nc_int_call to use its more generic
    function instead.

    block/floppy: fix contended case in floppy_queue_rq()
    
    commit 263c61581a38d0a5ad1f5f4a9143b27d68caeffd upstream.
    
    Since the switch of floppy driver to blk-mq, the contended (fdc_busy) case
    in floppy_queue_rq() is not handled correctly.
    
    In case we reach floppy_queue_rq() with fdc_busy set (i.e. with the floppy
    locked due to another request still being in-flight), we put the request
    on the list of requests and return BLK_STS_OK to the block core, without
    actually scheduling delayed work / doing further processing of the
    request. This means that processing of this request is postponed until
    another request comes and passess uncontended.
    
    Which in some cases might actually never happen and we keep waiting
    indefinitely. The simple testcase is
    
            for i in `seq 1 2000`; do echo -en $i '\r'; blkid --info /dev/fd0 2> /dev/null; done
    
    run in quemu. That reliably causes blkid eventually indefinitely hanging
    in __floppy_read_block_0() waiting for completion, as the BIO callback
    never happens, and no further IO is ever submitted on the (non-existent)
    floppy device. This was observed reliably on qemu-emulated device.
    
    Fix that by not queuing the request in the contended case, and return
    BLK_STS_RESOURCE instead, so that blk core handles the request
    rescheduling and let it pass properly non-contended later.

    mmc: sdio: Fix several potential memory leaks in mmc_sdio_init_card()
    
    commit a94a59f43749b4f8cd81b8be87c95f9ef898d19d upstream.
    
    Over the years, the code in mmc_sdio_init_card() has grown to become quite
    messy. Unfortunate this has also lead to that several paths are leaking
    memory in form of an allocated struct mmc_card, which includes additional
    data, such as initialized struct device for example.
    
    Unfortunate, it's a too complex task find each offending commit. Therefore,
    this change fixes all memory leaks at once.

    commit f04086c225da11ad16d7f9a2fbca6483ab16dded upstream.
    
    During some scenarios mmc_sdio_init_card() runs a retry path for the UHS-I
    specific initialization, which leads to removal of the previously allocated
    card. A new card is then re-allocated while retrying.
    
    However, in one of the corresponding error paths we may end up to remove an
    already removed card, which likely leads to a NULL pointer exception. So,
    let's fix this.

    The boot ROM of a new Socionext SoC unmasks interrupts (CTL_IRQ_MASK)
    somehow. The handler is invoked before tmio_mmc_host_probe(), then
    emits noisy call trace.
    
    Move devm_request_irq() below tmio_mmc_host_probe().

    mmc: tmio: Further fixup runtime PM management at remove
    
    commit 4bd784411aca022622e484eb262f5a0540ae732c upstream.
    
    Before calling tmio_mmc_host_probe(), the caller is required to enable
    clocks for its device, as to make it accessible when reading/writing
    registers during probe.
    
    Therefore, the responsibility to disable these clocks, in the error path of
    ->probe() and during ->remove(), is better managed outside
    tmio_mmc_host_remove(). As a matter of fact, callers of
    tmio_mmc_host_remove() already expects this to be the behaviour.
    
    However, there's a problem with tmio_mmc_host_remove() when the Kconfig
    option, CONFIG_PM, is set. More precisely, tmio_mmc_host_remove() may then
    disable the clock via runtime PM, which leads to clock enable/disable
    imbalance problems, when the caller of tmio_mmc_host_remove() also tries to
    disable the same clocks.
    
    To solve the problem, let's make sure tmio_mmc_host_remove() leaves the
    device with clocks enabled, but also make sure to disable the IRQs, as we
    normally do at ->runtime_suspend().

    DMA api debug brings to light leaking dma-mappings, dma_map_sg and
    dma_unmap_sg are not correctly balanced.
    
    If a request is prepared, the dma_map/unmap are done in asynchronous call
    pre_req (prep_data) and post_req (unprep_data). In this case the
    dma-mapping is right balanced.
    
    But if the request was not prepared, the data->host_cookie is define to
    zero and the dma_map/unmap must be done in the request.  The dma_map is
    called by mmci_dma_start (prep_data), but there is no dma_unmap in this
    case.
    
    This patch adds dma_unmap_sg when the dma is finalized and the data cookie
    is zero (request not prepared).

    After changing the timing between GTT updates and execution on the GPU,
    we started seeing sporadic failures on Ironlake. These were narrowed
    down to being an insufficiently strong enough barrier/delay after
    updating the GTT and scheduling execution on the GPU. By forcing the
    uncached read, and adding the missing barrier for the singular
    insert_page (relocation paths), the sporadic failures go away.

    perf: Add cond_resched() to task_function_call()
    
    commit 2ed6edd33a214bca02bd2b45e3fc3038a059436b upstream.
    
    Under rare circumstances, task_function_call() can repeatedly fail and
    cause a soft lockup.
    
    There is a slight race where the process is no longer running on the cpu
    we targeted by the time remote_function() runs.  The code will simply
    try again.  If we are very unlucky, this will continue to fail, until a
    watchdog fires.  This can happen in a heavily loaded, multi-core virtual
    machine.

    fat: don't allow to mount if the FAT length == 0
    
    commit b1b65750b8db67834482f758fc385bfa7560d228 upstream.
    
    If FAT length == 0, the image doesn't have any data. And it can be the
    cause of overlapping the root dir and FAT entries.
    
    Also Windows treats it as invalid format.

    mm/slub: fix a memory leak in sysfs_slab_add()
    
    commit dde3c6b72a16c2db826f54b2d49bdea26c3534a2 upstream.
    
    syzkaller reports for memory leak when kobject_init_and_add() returns an
    error in the function sysfs_slab_add() [1]
    
    When this happened, the function kobject_put() is not called for the
    corresponding kobject, which potentially leads to memory leak.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by calling kobject_put() even if
    kobject_init_and_add() fails.
    
    [1]
      BUG: memory leak

    drm/vkms: Hold gem object while still in-use
    
    commit 0ea2ea42b31abc1141f2fd3911f952a97d401fcb upstream.
    
    We need to keep the reference to the drm_gem_object
    until the last access by vkms_dumb_create.
    
    Therefore, the put the object after it is used.
    
    This fixes a use-after-free issue reported by syzbot.
    
    While here, change vkms_gem_create() symbol to static.

    KVM: arm64: Make vcpu_cp1x() work on Big Endian hosts
    
    commit 3204be4109ad681523e3461ce64454c79278450a upstream.
    
    AArch32 CP1x registers are overlayed on their AArch64 counterparts
    in the vcpu struct. This leads to an interesting problem as they
    are stored in their CPU-local format, and thus a CP1x register
    doesn't "hit" the lower 32bit portion of the AArch64 register on
    a BE host.
    
    To workaround this unfortunate situation, introduce a bias trick
    in the vcpu_cp1x() accessors which picks the correct half of the
    64bit register.

    KVM: arm64: Stop writing aarch32's CSSELR into ACTLR
    
    commit 7c582bf4ed84f3eb58bdd1f63024a14c17551e7d upstream.
    
    aarch32 has pairs of registers to access the high and low parts of 64bit
    registers. KVM has a union of 64bit sys_regs[] and 32bit copro[]. The
    32bit accessors read the high or low part of the 64bit sys_reg[] value
    through the union.
    
    Both sys_reg_descs[] and cp15_regs[] list access_csselr() as the accessor
    for CSSELR{,_EL1}. access_csselr() is only aware of the 64bit sys_regs[],
    and expects r->reg to be 'CSSELR_EL1' in the enum, index 2 of the 64bit
    array.
    
    cp15_regs[] uses the 32bit copro[] alias of sys_regs[]. Here CSSELR is
    c0_CSSELR which is the same location in sys_reg[]. r->reg is 'c0_CSSELR',
    index 4 in the 32bit array.
    
    access_csselr() uses the 32bit r->reg value to access the 64bit array,
    so reads and write the wrong value. sys_regs[4], is ACTLR_EL1, which
    is subsequently save/restored when we enter the guest.
    
    ACTLR_EL1 is supposed to be read-only for the guest. This register
    only affects execution at EL1, and the host's value is restored before
    we return to host EL1.
    
    Convert the 32bit register index back to the 64bit version.

    KVM: MIPS: Fix VPN2_MASK definition for variable cpu_vmbits
    
    commit 5816c76dea116a458f1932eefe064e35403248eb upstream.
    
    If a CPU support more than 32bit vmbits (which is true for 64bit CPUs),
    VPN2_MASK set to fixed 0xffffe000 will lead to a wrong EntryHi in some
    functions such as _kvm_mips_host_tlb_inv().
    
    The cpu_vmbits definition of 32bit CPU in cpu-features.h is 31, so we
    still use the old definition.

    commit fe2b73dba47fb6d6922df1ad44e83b1754d5ed4d upstream.

    set asid_mask to cpuinfo->asid_mask.
    
    So in order to support variable ASID_MASK, KVM_ENTRYHI_ASID should also

    KVM: nVMX: Consult only the "basic" exit reason when routing nested exit
    
    commit 2ebac8bb3c2d35f5135466490fc8eeaf3f3e2d37 upstream.
    
    Consult only the basic exit reason, i.e. bits 15:0 of vmcs.EXIT_REASON,
    when determining whether a nested VM-Exit should be reflected into L1 or
    handled by KVM in L0.
    
    For better or worse, the switch statement in nested_vmx_exit_reflected()
    currently defaults to "true", i.e. reflects any nested VM-Exit without
    dedicated logic.  Because the case statements only contain the basic
    exit reason, any VM-Exit with modifier bits set will be reflected to L1,
    even if KVM intended to handle it in L0.
    
    Practically speaking, this only affects EXIT_REASON_MCE_DURING_VMENTRY,
    i.e. a #MC that occurs on nested VM-Enter would be incorrectly routed to
    L1, as "failed VM-Entry" is the only modifier that KVM can currently
    encounter.  The SMM modifiers will never be generated as KVM doesn't
    support/employ a SMI Transfer Monitor.  Ditto for "exit from enclave",
    as KVM doesn't yet support virtualizing SGX, i.e. it's impossible to
    enter an enclave in a KVM guest (L1 or L2).

    KVM: nVMX: Skip IBPB when switching between vmcs01 and vmcs02
    
    commit 5c911beff20aa8639e7a1f28988736c13e03ed54 upstream.
    
    Skip the Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier that is triggered on a VMCS
    switch when running with spectre_v2_user=on/auto if the switch is
    between two VMCSes in the same guest, i.e. between vmcs01 and vmcs02.
    The IBPB is intended to prevent one guest from attacking another, which
    is unnecessary in the nested case as it's the same guest from KVM's
    perspective.
    
    This all but eliminates the overhead observed for nested VMX transitions
    when running with CONFIG_RETPOLINE=y and spectre_v2_user=on/auto, which
    can be significant, e.g. roughly 3x on current systems.

    media: videobuf2-dma-contig: fix bad kfree in vb2_dma_contig_clear_max_seg_size
    
    commit 0d9668721311607353d4861e6c32afeb272813dc upstream.
    
    Commit 9495b7e92f716ab2bd6814fab5e97ab4a39adfdd ("driver core: platform:
    Initialize dma_parms for platform devices") in v5.7-rc5 causes
    vb2_dma_contig_clear_max_seg_size() to kfree memory that was not
    allocated by vb2_dma_contig_set_max_seg_size().
    
    The assumption in vb2_dma_contig_set_max_seg_size() seems to be that
    dev->dma_parms is always NULL when the driver is probed, and the case
    where dev->dma_parms has bee initialized by someone else than the driver
    (by calling vb2_dma_contig_set_max_seg_size) will cause a failure.
    
    All the current users of these functions are platform devices, which now
    always have dma_parms set by the driver core. To fix the issue for v5.7,
    make vb2_dma_contig_set_max_seg_size() return an error if dma_parms is
    NULL to be on the safe side, and remove the kfree code from
    vb2_dma_contig_clear_max_seg_size().
    
    For v5.8 we should remove the two functions and move the

    commit 18722d48a6bb9c2e8d046214c0a5fd19d0a7c9f6 upstream.
    
    Some memory is vmalloc'ed in the 'w100fb_save_vidmem' function and freed in
    the 'w100fb_restore_vidmem' function. (these functions are called
    respectively from the 'suspend' and the 'resume' functions)
    
    However, it is also freed in the 'remove' function.
    
    In order to avoid a potential double free, set the corresponding pointer
    to NULL once freed in the 'w100fb_restore_vidmem' function.

    confuses the latter, which only expects to see 0 or negative error
    codes, so notice that cpufreq_boost_set_sw() can return an error code
    (which should not be -EINVAL for that matter) as soon as the first
    policy without a frequency table is found (because either all policies
    have a frequency table or none of them have it) and rework it to meet
    its caller's expectations.

    remoteproc: Fix and restore the parenting hierarchy for vdev
    
    commit c774ad010873bb89dcc0cdcb1e96aef6664d8caf upstream.
    
    The commit 086d08725d34 ("remoteproc: create vdev subdevice with specific
    dma memory pool") has introduced a new vdev subdevice for each vdev
    declared in the firmware resource table and made it as the parent for the
    created virtio rpmsg devices instead of the previous remoteproc device.
    This changed the overall parenting hierarchy for the rpmsg devices, which
    were children of virtio devices, and does not allow the corresponding
    rpmsg drivers to retrieve the parent rproc device through the
    rproc_get_by_child() API.
    
    Fix this by restoring the remoteproc device as the parent. The new vdev
    subdevice can continue to inherit the DMA attributes from the remoteproc's
    parent device (actual platform device).

    remoteproc: Fall back to using parent memory pool if no dedicated available
    
    commit db9178a4f8c4e523f824892cb8bab00961b07385 upstream.
    
    In some cases, like with OMAP remoteproc, we are not creating dedicated
    memory pool for the virtio device. Instead, we use the same memory pool
    for all shared memories. The current virtio memory pool handling forces
    a split between these two, as a separate device is created for it,
    causing memory to be allocated from bad location if the dedicated pool
    is not available. Fix this by falling back to using the parent device
    memory pool if dedicated is not available.

    proc: Use new_inode not new_inode_pseudo
    
    commit ef1548adada51a2f32ed7faef50aa465e1b4c5da upstream.
    
    Recently syzbot reported that unmounting proc when there is an ongoing
    inotify watch on the root directory of proc could result in a use
    after free when the watch is removed after the unmount of proc
    when the watcher exits.
    
    Commit 69879c01a0c3 ("proc: Remove the now unnecessary internal mount
    of proc") made it easier to unmount proc and allowed syzbot to see the
    problem, but looking at the code it has been around for a long time.
    
    Looking at the code the fsnotify watch should have been removed by
    fsnotify_sb_delete in generic_shutdown_super.  Unfortunately the inode
    was allocated with new_inode_pseudo instead of new_inode so the inode
    was not on the sb->s_inodes list.  Which prevented
    fsnotify_unmount_inodes from finding the inode and removing the watch
    as well as made it so the "VFS: Busy inodes after unmount" warning
    could not find the inodes to warn about them.
    
    Make all of the inodes in proc visible to generic_shutdown_super,
    and fsnotify_sb_delete by using new_inode instead of new_inode_pseudo.
    The only functional difference is that new_inode places the inodes
    on the sb->s_inodes list.
    
    I wrote a small test program and I can verify that without changes it
    can trigger this issue, and by replacing new_inode_pseudo with
    new_inode the issues goes away.

    ovl: initialize error in ovl_copy_xattr
    
    commit 520da69d265a91c6536c63851cbb8a53946974f0 upstream.
    
    In ovl_copy_xattr, if all the xattrs to be copied are overlayfs private
    xattrs, the copy loop will terminate without assigning anything to the
    error variable, thus returning an uninitialized value.
    
    If ovl_copy_xattr is called from ovl_clear_empty, this uninitialized error
    value is put into a pointer by ERR_PTR(), causing potential invalid memory
    accesses down the line.
    
    This commit initialize error with 0. This is the correct value because when
    there's no xattr to copy, because all xattrs are private, ovl_copy_xattr
    should succeed.
    
    This bug is discovered with the help of INIT_STACK_ALL and clang.

    ovl: fix out of bounds access warning in ovl_check_fb_len()
    
    commit 522f6e6cba6880a038e2bd88e10390b84cd3febd upstream.
    
    syzbot reported out of bounds memory access from open_by_handle_at()
    with a crafted file handle that looks like this:
    
      { .handle_bytes = 2, .handle_type = OVL_FILEID_V1 }
    
    handle_bytes gets rounded down to 0 and we end up calling:
      ovl_check_fh_len(fh, 0) => ovl_check_fb_len(fh + 3, -3)
    
    But fh buffer is only 2 bytes long, so accessing struct ovl_fb at
    fh + 3 is illegal.

    net/mlx5e: Fix repeated XSK usage on one channel
    
    [ Upstream commit 36d45fb9d2fdf348d778bfe73f0427db1c6f9bc7 ]
    
    After an XSK is closed, the relevant structures in the channel are not
    zeroed. If an XSK is opened the second time on the same channel without
    recreating channels, the stray values in the structures will lead to
    incorrect operation of queues, which causes CQE errors, and the new
    socket doesn't work at all.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by explicitly zeroing XSK-related structs in
    the channel on XSK close. Note that those structs are zeroed on channel
    creation, and usually a configuration change (XDP program is set)
    happens on XSK open, which leads to recreating channels, so typical XSK
    usecases don't suffer from this issue. However, if XSKs are opened and
    closed on the same channel without removing the XDP program, this bug
    reproduces.

    net/mlx5: Fix fatal error handling during device load
    
    [ Upstream commit b6e0b6bebe0732d5cac51f0791f269d2413b8980 ]
    
    Currently, in case of fatal error during mlx5_load_one(), we cannot
    enter error state until mlx5_load_one() is finished, what can take
    several minutes until commands will get timeouts, because these commands
    can't be processed due to the fatal error.
    Fix it by setting dev->state as MLX5_DEVICE_STATE_INTERNAL_ERROR before
    requesting the lock.

    net/mlx5: drain health workqueue in case of driver load error
    
    [ Upstream commit 42ea9f1b5c625fad225d4ac96a7e757dd4199d9c ]
    
    In case there is a work in the health WQ when we teardown the driver,
    in driver load error flow, the health work will try to read dev->iseg,
    which was already unmap in mlx5_pci_close().
    Fix it by draining the health workqueue first thing in mlx5_pci_close().

    [ Upstream commit f5f27b79eab80de0287c243a22169e4876b08d5e ]
    
    The header of the message to send can be changed if the
    response is longer than the request:
     - 1st word, the header is sent
     - the remaining words of the message are sent
     - the response is received asynchronously during the
       execution of the loop, changing the size field in
       the header
     - the for loop test the termination condition using
       the corrupted header
    
    It is the case for the API build_info which has just a
    header as request but 3 words in response.
    
    This issue is fixed storing the header locally instead of
    using a pointer on it.

    firmware: imx-scu: Support one TX and one RX
    
    [ Upstream commit f25a066d1a07affb7bea4e5d9c179c3338338e23 ]
    
    Current imx-scu requires four TX and four RX to communicate with
    SCU. This is low efficient and causes lots of mailbox interrupts.
    
    With imx-mailbox driver could support one TX to use all four transmit
    registers and one RX to use all four receive registers, imx-scu
    could use one TX and one RX.

    x86/{mce,mm}: Unmap the entire page if the whole page is affected and poisoned
    
    commit 17fae1294ad9d711b2c3dd0edef479d40c76a5e8 upstream.
    
    An interesting thing happened when a guest Linux instance took a machine
    check. The VMM unmapped the bad page from guest physical space and
    passed the machine check to the guest.
    
    Linux took all the normal actions to offline the page from the process
    that was using it. But then guest Linux crashed because it said there
    was a second machine check inside the kernel with this stack trace:
    
    do_memory_failure
        set_mce_nospec
             set_memory_uc
                  _set_memory_uc
                       change_page_attr_set_clr
                            cpa_flush
                                 clflush_cache_range_opt
    
    This was odd, because a CLFLUSH instruction shouldn't raise a machine
    check (it isn't consuming the data). Further investigation showed that
    the VMM had passed in another machine check because is appeared that the
    guest was accessing the bad page.
    
    Fix is to check the scope of the poison by checking the MCi_MISC register.
    If the entire page is affected, then unmap the page. If only part of the
    page is affected, then mark the page as uncacheable.
    
    This assumes that VMMs will do the logical thing and pass in the "whole
    page scope" via the MCi_MISC register (since they unmapped the entire
    page).

    crypto: virtio: Fix use-after-free in virtio_crypto_skcipher_finalize_req()
    
    commit 8c855f0720ff006d75d0a2512c7f6c4f60ff60ee upstream.
    
    The system'll crash when the users insmod crypto/tcrypto.ko with mode=155
    ( testing "authenc(hmac(sha1),cbc(aes))" ). It's caused by reuse the memory
    of request structure.
    
    In crypto_authenc_init_tfm(), the reqsize is set to:
      [PART 1] sizeof(authenc_request_ctx) +
      [PART 2] ictx->reqoff +
      [PART 3] MAX(ahash part, skcipher part)
    and the 'PART 3' is used by both ahash and skcipher in turn.
    
    When the virtio_crypto driver finish skcipher req, it'll call ->complete
    callback(in crypto_finalize_skcipher_request) and then free its
    resources whose pointers are recorded in 'skcipher parts'.
    
    However, the ->complete is 'crypto_authenc_encrypt_done' in this case,
    it will use the 'ahash part' of the request and change its content,
    so virtio_crypto driver will get the wrong pointer after ->complete
    finish and mistakenly free some other's memory. So the system will crash
    when these memory will be used again.
    
    The resources which need to be cleaned up are not used any more. But the
    pointers of these resources may be changed in the function
    "crypto_finalize_skcipher_request". Thus release specific resources before
    calling this function.

    crypto: algapi - Avoid spurious modprobe on LOADED
    
    commit beeb460cd12ac9b91640b484b6a52dcba9d9fc8f upstream.
    
    Currently after any algorithm is registered and tested, there's an
    unnecessary request_module("cryptomgr") even if it's already loaded.
    Also, CRYPTO_MSG_ALG_LOADED is sent twice, and thus if the algorithm is
    "crct10dif", lib/crc-t10dif.c replaces the tfm twice rather than once.
    
    This occurs because CRYPTO_MSG_ALG_LOADED is sent using
    crypto_probing_notify(), which tries to load "cryptomgr" if the
    notification is not handled (NOTIFY_DONE).  This doesn't make sense
    because "cryptomgr" doesn't handle this notification.
    
    Fix this by using crypto_notify() instead of crypto_probing_notify().

    gup: document and work around "COW can break either way" issue
    
    commit 17839856fd588f4ab6b789f482ed3ffd7c403e1f upstream.
    
    Doing a "get_user_pages()" on a copy-on-write page for reading can be
    ambiguous: the page can be COW'ed at any time afterwards, and the
    direction of a COW event isn't defined.
    
    Yes, whoever writes to it will generally do the COW, but if the thread
    that did the get_user_pages() unmapped the page before the write (and
    that could happen due to memory pressure in addition to any outright
    action), the writer could also just take over the old page instead.
    
    End result: the get_user_pages() call might result in a page pointer
    that is no longer associated with the original VM, and is associated
    with - and controlled by - another VM having taken it over instead.
    
    So when doing a get_user_pages() on a COW mapping, the only really safe
    thing to do would be to break the COW when getting the page, even when
    only getting it for reading.
    
    At the same time, some users simply don't even care.
    
    For example, the perf code wants to look up the page not because it
    cares about the page, but because the code simply wants to look up the
    physical address of the access for informational purposes, and doesn't
    really care about races when a page might be unmapped and remapped
    elsewhere.
    
    This adds logic to force a COW event by setting FOLL_WRITE on any
    copy-on-write mapping when FOLL_GET (or FOLL_PIN) is used to get a page
    pointer as a result.
    
    The current semantics end up being:
    
     - __get_user_pages_fast(): no change. If you don't ask for a write,
       you won't break COW. You'd better know what you're doing.
    
     - get_user_pages_fast(): the fast-case "look it up in the page tables
       without anything getting mmap_sem" now refuses to follow a read-only
       page, since it might need COW breaking.  Which happens in the slow
       path - the fast path doesn't know if the memory might be COW or not.
    
     - get_user_pages() (including the slow-path fallback for gup_fast()):
       for a COW mapping, turn on FOLL_WRITE for FOLL_GET/FOLL_PIN, with
       very similar semantics to FOLL_FORCE.
    
    If it turns out that we want finer granularity (ie "only break COW when
    it might actually matter" - things like the zero page are special and
    don't need to be broken) we might need to push these semantics deeper
    into the lookup fault path.  So if people care enough, it's possible
    that we might end up adding a new internal FOLL_BREAK_COW flag to go
    with the internal FOLL_COW flag we already have for tracking "I had a
    COW".
    
    Alternatively, if it turns out that different callers might want to
    explicitly control the forced COW break behavior, we might even want to
    make such a flag visible to the users of get_user_pages() instead of
    using the above default semantics.
    
    But for now, this is mostly commentary on the issue (this commit message
    being a lot bigger than the patch, and that patch in turn is almost all
    comments), with that minimal "enable COW breaking early" logic using the
    existing FOLL_WRITE behavior.
    
    [ It might be worth noting that we've always had this ambiguity, and it
      could arguably be seen as a user-space issue.
    
      You only get private COW mappings that could break either way in
      situations where user space is doing cooperative things (ie fork()
      before an execve() etc), but it _is_ surprising and very subtle, and
      fork() is supposed to give you independent address spaces.
    
      So let's treat this as a kernel issue and make the semantics of
      get_user_pages() easier to understand. Note that obviously a true
      shared mapping will still get a page that can change under us, so this
      does _not_ mean that get_user_pages() somehow returns any "stable"
      page ]

    clk_pm_runtime_get() assumes that the PM-runtime usage counter will

    so PM-runtime references to devices acquired by the former are leaked

    spi: bcm2835aux: Fix controller unregister order
    
    commit b9dd3f6d417258ad0beeb292a1bc74200149f15d upstream.
    
    The BCM2835aux SPI driver uses devm_spi_register_master() on bind.
    As a consequence, on unbind, __device_release_driver() first invokes
    bcm2835aux_spi_remove() before unregistering the SPI controller via
    devres_release_all().
    
    This order is incorrect:  bcm2835aux_spi_remove() turns off the SPI
    controller, including its interrupts and clock.  The SPI controller
    is thus no longer usable.
    
    When the SPI controller is subsequently unregistered, it unbinds all
    its slave devices.  If their drivers need to access the SPI bus,
    e.g. to quiesce their interrupts, unbinding will fail.
    
    As a rule, devm_spi_register_master() must not be used if the
    ->remove() hook performs teardown steps which shall be performed
    after unbinding of slaves.
    
    Fix by using the non-devm variant spi_register_master().  Note that the
    struct spi_master as well as the driver-private data are not freed until
    after bcm2835aux_spi_remove() has finished, so accessing them is safe.

    spi: pxa2xx: Fix runtime PM ref imbalance on probe error
    
    commit 65e318e17358a3fd4fcb5a69d89b14016dee2f06 upstream.
    
    The PXA2xx SPI driver releases a runtime PM ref in the probe error path
    even though it hasn't acquired a ref earlier.
    
    Apparently commit e2b714afee32 ("spi: pxa2xx: Disable runtime PM if
    controller registration fails") sought to copy-paste the invocation of
    pm_runtime_disable() from pxa2xx_spi_remove(), but erroneously copied
    the call to pm_runtime_put_noidle() as well.  Drop it.

    spi: pxa2xx: Fix controller unregister order
    
    commit 32e5b57232c0411e7dea96625c415510430ac079 upstream.
    
    The PXA2xx SPI driver uses devm_spi_register_controller() on bind.
    As a consequence, on unbind, __device_release_driver() first invokes
    pxa2xx_spi_remove() before unregistering the SPI controller via
    devres_release_all().
    
    This order is incorrect:  pxa2xx_spi_remove() disables the chip,
    rendering the SPI bus inaccessible even though the SPI controller is
    still registered.  When the SPI controller is subsequently unregistered,
    it unbinds all its slave devices.  Because their drivers cannot access
    the SPI bus, e.g. to quiesce interrupts, the slave devices may be left
    in an improper state.
    
    As a rule, devm_spi_register_controller() must not be used if the
    ->remove() hook performs teardown steps which shall be performed after
    unregistering the controller and specifically after unbinding of slaves.
    
    Fix by reverting to the non-devm variant of spi_register_controller().
    
    An alternative approach would be to use device-managed functions for all
    steps in pxa2xx_spi_remove(), e.g. by calling devm_add_action_or_reset()
    on probe.  However that approach would add more LoC to the driver and
    it wouldn't lend itself as well to backporting to stable.
    
    The improper use of devm_spi_register_controller() was introduced in 2013
    by commit a807fcd090d6 ("spi: pxa2xx: use devm_spi_register_master()"),
    but all earlier versions of the driver going back to 2006 were likewise
    broken because they invoked spi_unregister_master() at the end of
    pxa2xx_spi_remove(), rather than at the beginning.

    spi: Fix controller unregister order
    
    commit 84855678add8aba927faf76bc2f130a40f94b6f7 upstream.
    
    When an SPI controller unregisters, it unbinds all its slave devices.
    For this, their drivers may need to access the SPI bus, e.g. to quiesce
    interrupts.
    
    However since commit ffbbdd21329f ("spi: create a message queueing
    infrastructure"), spi_destroy_queue() is executed before unbinding the
    slaves.  It sets ctlr->running = false, thereby preventing SPI bus
    access and causing unbinding of slave devices to fail.
    
    Fix by unbinding slaves before calling spi_destroy_queue().

    commit 8301c719a2bd131436438e49130ee381d30933f5 upstream.
    
    After commit c3aab9a0bd91 ("mm/filemap.c: don't initiate writeback if

    set_page_writeback() can call inc_wb_stat(inode_to_wb(inode),
    WB_WRITEBACK) where inode_to_wb(inode) is NULL if the inode of
    underlying block device does not have an associated wb.
    
    This fixes the issue by calling inode_attach_wb() in advance to ensure
    to associate the bdev inode with its wb.

    lib/lzo: fix ambiguous encoding bug in lzo-rle
    
    commit b5265c813ce4efbfa2e46fd27cdf9a7f44a35d2e upstream.
    
    In some rare cases, for input data over 32 KB, lzo-rle could encode two
    different inputs to the same compressed representation, so that
    decompression is then ambiguous (i.e.  data may be corrupted - although
    zram is not affected because it operates over 4 KB pages).
    
    This modifies the compressor without changing the decompressor or the
    bitstream format, such that:
    
     - there is no change to how data produced by the old compressor is
       decompressed
    
     - an old decompressor will correctly decode data from the updated
       compressor
    
     - performance and compression ratio are not affected
    
     - we avoid introducing a new bitstream format
    
    In testing over 12.8M real-world files totalling 903 GB, three files
    were affected by this bug.  I also constructed 37M semi-random 64 KB
    files totalling 2.27 TB, and saw no affected files.  Finally I tested
    over files constructed to contain each of the ~1024 possible bad input
    sequences; for all of these cases, updated lzo-rle worked correctly.
    
    There is no significant impact to performance or compression ratio.

    include/linux/stddef.h which should implement the same logic using
    __builtin_offsetof, so that UBSAN wont warn.

    ACPI: PM: Avoid using power resources if there are none for D0
    
    commit 956ad9d98b73f59e442cc119c98ba1e04e94fe6d upstream.
    
    As recently reported, some platforms provide a list of power
    resources for device power state D3hot, through the _PR3 object,
    but they do not provide a list of power resources for device power
    state D0.
    
    Among other things, this causes acpi_device_get_power() to return
    D3hot as the current state of the device in question if all of the
    D3hot power resources are "on", because it sees the power_resources
    flag set and calls acpi_power_get_inferred_state() which finds that
    D3hot is the shallowest power state with all of the associated power
    resources turned "on", so that's what it returns.  Moreover, that
    value takes precedence over the acpi_dev_pm_explicit_get() return
    value, because it means a deeper power state.  The device may very
    well be in D0 physically at that point, however.
    
    Moreover, the presence of _PR3 without _PR0 for a given device
    means that only one D3-level power state can be supported by it.
    Namely, because there are no power resources to turn "off" when
    transitioning the device from D0 into D3cold (which should be
    supported since _PR3 is present), the evaluation of _PS3 should
    be sufficient to put it straight into D3cold, but this means that
    the effect of turning "on" the _PR3 power resources is unclear,
    so it is better to avoid doing that altogether.  Consequently,
    there is no practical way do distinguish D3cold from D3hot for
    the device in question and the power states of it can be labeled
    so that D3hot is the deepest supported one (and Linux assumes
    that putting a device into D3hot via ACPI may cause power to be
    removed from it anyway, for legacy reasons).
    
    To work around the problem described above modify the ACPI
    enumeration of devices so that power resources are only used
    for device power management if the list of D0 power resources
    is not empty and make it mart D3cold as supported only if that
    is the case and the D3hot list of power resources is not empty
    too.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix inconsistent card PM state after resume
    
    commit 862b2509d157c629dd26d7ac6c6cdbf043d332eb upstream.
    
    When a USB-audio interface gets runtime-suspended via auto-pm feature,
    the driver suspends all functionality and increment
    chip->num_suspended_intf.  Later on, when the system gets suspended to
    S3, the driver increments chip->num_suspended_intf again, skips the
    device changes, and sets the card power state to
    SNDRV_CTL_POWER_D3hot.  In return, when the system gets resumed from
    S3, the resume callback decrements chip->num_suspended_intf.  Since
    this refcount is still not zero (it's been runtime-suspended), the
    whole resume is skipped.  But there is a small pitfall here.
    
    The problem is that the driver doesn't restore the card power state
    after this resume call, leaving it as SNDRV_CTL_POWER_D3hot.  So,
    even after the system resume finishes, the card instance still appears
    as if it were system-suspended, and this confuses many ioctl accesses
    that are blocked unexpectedly.
    
    In details, we have two issues behind the scene: one is that the card
    power state is changed only when the refcount becomes zero, and
    another is that the prior auto-suspend check is kept in a boolean
    flag.  Although the latter problem is almost negligible since the
    auto-pm feature is imposed only on the primary interface, but this can
    be a potential problem on the devices with multiple interfaces.
    
    This patch addresses those issues by the following:
    
    - Replace chip->autosuspended boolean flag with chip->system_suspend
      counter
    
    - At the first system-suspend, chip->num_suspended_intf is recorded to
      chip->system_suspend
    
    - At system-resume, the card power state is restored when the
      chip->num_suspended_intf refcount reaches to chip->system_suspend,
      i.e. the state returns to the auto-suspended
    
    Also, the patch fixes yet another hidden problem by the code
    refactoring along with the fixes above: namely, when some resume
    procedure failed, the driver left chip->num_suspended_intf that was
    already decreased, and it might lead to the refcount unbalance.
    In the new code, the refcount decrement is done after the whole resume
    procedure, and the problem is avoided as well.

    ALSA: fireface: start IR context immediately
    
    commit f4588cc425beb62e355bc2a5de5d5c83e26a74ca upstream.
    
    In the latter models of RME Fireface series, device start to transfer
    packets several dozens of milliseconds. On the other hand, ALSA fireface
    driver starts IR context 2 milliseconds after the start. This results
    in loss to handle incoming packets on the context.
    
    This commit changes to start IR context immediately instead of
    postponement. For Fireface 800, this affects nothing because the device
    transfer packets 100 milliseconds or so after the start and this is
    within wait timeout.

    smb3: add indatalen that can be a non-zero value to calculation of credit charge in smb2 ioctl
    
    commit ebf57440ec59a36e1fc5fe91e31d66ae0d1662d0 upstream.
    
    Some of tests in xfstests failed with cifsd kernel server since commit
    e80ddeb2f70e. cifsd kernel server validates credit charge from client
    by calculating it base on max((InputCount + OutputCount) and
    (MaxInputResponse + MaxOutputResponse)) according to specification.
    
    MS-SMB2 specification describe credit charge calculation of smb2 ioctl :
    
    If Connection.SupportsMultiCredit is TRUE, the server MUST validate
    CreditCharge based on the maximum of (InputCount + OutputCount) and
    (MaxInputResponse + MaxOutputResponse), as specified in section 3.3.5.2.5.
    If the validation fails, it MUST fail the IOCTL request with
    STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.
    
    This patch add indatalen that can be a non-zero value to calculation of
    credit charge in SMB2_ioctl_init().

    We were not checking to see if ioctl requests asked for more than

    CIFSMaxBufSize then ioctls would fail with invalid parameter errors.

    KVM: x86: Fix APIC page invalidation race
    
    commit e649b3f0188f8fd34dd0dde8d43fd3312b902fb2 upstream.
    
    Commit b1394e745b94 ("KVM: x86: fix APIC page invalidation") tried
    to fix inappropriate APIC page invalidation by re-introducing arch
    specific kvm_arch_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range() and calling it from
    kvm_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start. However, the patch left a
    possible race where the VMCS APIC address cache is updated *before*
    it is unmapped:
    
      (Invalidator) kvm_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start()
      (Invalidator) kvm_make_all_cpus_request(kvm, KVM_REQ_APIC_PAGE_RELOAD)
      (KVM VCPU) vcpu_enter_guest()
      (KVM VCPU) kvm_vcpu_reload_apic_access_page()
      (Invalidator) actually unmap page
    
    Because of the above race, there can be a mismatch between the
    host physical address stored in the APIC_ACCESS_PAGE VMCS field and
    the host physical address stored in the EPT entry for the APIC GPA
    (0xfee0000).  When this happens, the processor will not trap APIC
    accesses, and will instead show the raw contents of the APIC-access page.
    Because Windows OS periodically checks for unexpected modifications to
    the LAPIC register, this will show up as a BSOD crash with BugCheck
    CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION (109) we are currently seeing in
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1751017.
    
    The root cause of the issue is that kvm_arch_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range()
    cannot guarantee that no additional references are taken to the pages in
    the range before kvm_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_end().  Fortunately,
    this case is supported by the MMU notifier API, as documented in
    include/linux/mmu_notifier.h:
    
             * If the subsystem
             * can't guarantee that no additional references are taken to
             * the pages in the range, it has to implement the
             * invalidate_range() notifier to remove any references taken
             * after invalidate_range_start().
    
    The fix therefore is to reload the APIC-access page field in the VMCS
    from kvm_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range() instead of ..._range_start().

    KVM: x86: respect singlestep when emulating instruction
    
    commit 384dea1c9183880be183cfaae161d99aafd16df6 upstream.
    
    When userspace configures KVM_GUESTDBG_SINGLESTEP, KVM will manage the
    presence of X86_EFLAGS_TF via kvm_set/get_rflags on vcpus. The actual
    rflag bit is therefore hidden from callers.
    
    That includes init_emulate_ctxt() which uses the value returned from
    kvm_get_flags() to set ctxt->tf. As a result, x86_emulate_instruction()
    will skip a single step, leaving singlestep_rip stale and not returning
    to userspace.
    
    This resolves the issue by observing the vcpu guest_debug configuration
    alongside ctxt->tf in x86_emulate_instruction(), performing the single
    step if set.

    x86/speculation: PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE enforcement for indirect branches.
    
    commit 4d8df8cbb9156b0a0ab3f802b80cb5db57acc0bf upstream.
    
    Currently, it is possible to enable indirect branch speculation even after
    it was force-disabled using the PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE option. Moreover, the
    PR_GET_SPECULATION_CTRL command gives afterwards an incorrect result
    (force-disabled when it is in fact enabled). This also is inconsistent
    vs. STIBP and the documention which cleary states that
    PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE cannot be undone.
    
    Fix this by actually enforcing force-disabled indirect branch
    speculation. PR_SPEC_ENABLE called after PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE now fails
    with -EPERM as described in the documentation.

    x86/speculation: Avoid force-disabling IBPB based on STIBP and enhanced IBRS.
    
    commit 21998a351512eba4ed5969006f0c55882d995ada upstream.
    
    When STIBP is unavailable or enhanced IBRS is available, Linux
    force-disables the IBPB mitigation of Spectre-BTB even when simultaneous
    multithreading is disabled. While attempts to enable IBPB using
    prctl(PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL, PR_SPEC_INDIRECT_BRANCH, ...) fail with
    EPERM, the seccomp syscall (or its prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, ...) equivalent)
    which are used e.g. by Chromium or OpenSSH succeed with no errors but the
    application remains silently vulnerable to cross-process Spectre v2 attacks
    (classical BTB poisoning). At the same time the SYSFS reporting
    (/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2) displays that IBPB is
    conditionally enabled when in fact it is unconditionally disabled.
    
    STIBP is useful only when SMT is enabled. When SMT is disabled and STIBP is
    unavailable, it makes no sense to force-disable also IBPB, because IBPB
    protects against cross-process Spectre-BTB attacks regardless of the SMT
    state. At the same time since missing STIBP was only observed on AMD CPUs,
    AMD does not recommend using STIBP, but recommends using IBPB, so disabling
    IBPB because of missing STIBP goes directly against AMD's advice:
    https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/Architecture_Guidelines_Update_Indirect_Branch_Control.pdf
    
    Similarly, enhanced IBRS is designed to protect cross-core BTB poisoning
    and BTB-poisoning attacks from user space against kernel (and
    BTB-poisoning attacks from guest against hypervisor), it is not designed
    to prevent cross-process (or cross-VM) BTB poisoning between processes (or
    VMs) running on the same core. Therefore, even with enhanced IBRS it is
    necessary to flush the BTB during context-switches, so there is no reason
    to force disable IBPB when enhanced IBRS is available.
    
    Enable the prctl control of IBPB even when STIBP is unavailable or enhanced
    IBRS is available.

    x86/speculation: Prevent rogue cross-process SSBD shutdown
    
    commit dbbe2ad02e9df26e372f38cc3e70dab9222c832e upstream.
    
    On context switch the change of TIF_SSBD and TIF_SPEC_IB are evaluated
    to adjust the mitigations accordingly. This is optimized to avoid the
    expensive MSR write if not needed.
    
    This optimization is buggy and allows an attacker to shutdown the SSBD
    protection of a victim process.
    
    The update logic reads the cached base value for the speculation control
    MSR which has neither the SSBD nor the STIBP bit set. It then OR's the
    SSBD bit only when TIF_SSBD is different and requests the MSR update.
    
    That means if TIF_SSBD of the previous and next task are the same, then
    the base value is not updated, even if TIF_SSBD is set. The MSR write is
    not requested.
    
    Subsequently if the TIF_STIBP bit differs then the STIBP bit is updated
    in the base value and the MSR is written with a wrong SSBD value.
    
    This was introduced when the per task/process conditional STIPB
    switching was added on top of the existing SSBD switching.
    
    It is exploitable if the attacker creates a process which enforces SSBD
    and has the contrary value of STIBP than the victim process (i.e. if the
    victim process enforces STIBP, the attacker process must not enforce it;
    if the victim process does not enforce STIBP, the attacker process must
    enforce it) and schedule it on the same core as the victim process. If
    the victim runs after the attacker the victim becomes vulnerable to
    Spectre V4.
    
    To fix this, update the MSR value independent of the TIF_SSBD difference
    and dependent on the SSBD mitigation method available. This ensures that
    a subsequent STIPB initiated MSR write has the correct state of SSBD.

    x86: mm: ptdump: calculate effective permissions correctly
    
    commit 1494e0c38ee903e83aefb58caf54a9217273d49a upstream.
    
    Patch series "Fix W+X debug feature on x86"
    
    Jan alerted me[1] that the W+X detection debug feature was broken in x86
    by my change[2] to switch x86 to use the generic ptdump infrastructure.
    
    Fundamentally the approach of trying to move the calculation of
    effective permissions into note_page() was broken because note_page() is
    only called for 'leaf' entries and the effective permissions are passed
    down via the internal nodes of the page tree.  The solution I've taken
    here is to create a new (optional) callback which is called for all
    nodes of the page tree and therefore can calculate the effective
    permissions.
    
    Secondly on some configurations (32 bit with PAE) "unsigned long" is not
    large enough to store the table entries.  The fix here is simple - let's
    just use a u64.

    [2] 2ae27137b2db ("x86: mm: convert dump_pagetables to use walk_page_range")
    
    This patch (of 2):
    
    By switching the x86 page table dump code to use the generic code the
    effective permissions are no longer calculated correctly because the
    note_page() function is only called for *leaf* entries.  To calculate
    the actual effective permissions it is necessary to observe the full
    hierarchy of the page tree.
    
    Introduce a new callback for ptdump which is called for every entry and
    can therefore update the prot_levels array correctly.  note_page() can
    then simply access the appropriate element in the array.

    x86_64: Fix jiffies ODR violation
    
    commit d8ad6d39c35d2b44b3d48b787df7f3359381dcbf upstream.
    
    'jiffies' and 'jiffies_64' are meant to alias (two different symbols that
    share the same address).  Most architectures make the symbols alias to the
    same address via a linker script assignment in their
    arch/<arch>/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S:
    
    jiffies = jiffies_64;
    
    which is effectively a definition of jiffies.
    
    jiffies and jiffies_64 are both forward declared for all architectures in
    include/linux/jiffies.h. jiffies_64 is defined in kernel/time/timer.c.
    
    x86_64 was peculiar in that it wasn't doing the above linker script
    assignment, but rather was:
    1. defining jiffies in arch/x86/kernel/time.c instead via the linker script.
    2. overriding the symbol jiffies_64 from kernel/time/timer.c in
    arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds.s via 'jiffies_64 = jiffies;'.
    
    As Fangrui notes:
    
      In LLD, symbol assignments in linker scripts override definitions in
      object files. GNU ld appears to have the same behavior. It would
      probably make sense for LLD to error "duplicate symbol" but GNU ld
      is unlikely to adopt for compatibility reasons.
    
    This results in an ODR violation (UB), which seems to have survived
    thus far. Where it becomes harmful is when;
    
    1. -fno-semantic-interposition is used:
    
    As Fangrui notes:
    
      Clang after LLVM commit 5b22bcc2b70d
      ("[X86][ELF] Prefer to lower MC_GlobalAddress operands to .Lfoo$local")
      defaults to -fno-semantic-interposition similar semantics which help
      -fpic/-fPIC code avoid GOT/PLT when the referenced symbol is defined
      within the same translation unit. Unlike GCC
      -fno-semantic-interposition, Clang emits such relocations referencing
      local symbols for non-pic code as well.
    
    This causes references to jiffies to refer to '.Ljiffies$local' when
    jiffies is defined in the same translation unit. Likewise, references to
    jiffies_64 become references to '.Ljiffies_64$local' in translation units
    that define jiffies_64.  Because these differ from the names used in the
    linker script, they will not be rewritten to alias one another.
    
    2. Full LTO
    
    Full LTO effectively treats all source files as one translation
    unit, causing these local references to be produced everywhere.  When
    the linker processes the linker script, there are no longer any
    references to jiffies_64' anywhere to replace with 'jiffies'.  And
    thus '.Ljiffies$local' and '.Ljiffies_64$local' no longer alias
    at all.
    
    In the process of porting patches enabling Full LTO from arm64 to x86_64,
    spooky bugs have been observed where the kernel appeared to boot, but init
    doesn't get scheduled.
    
    Avoid the ODR violation by matching other architectures and define jiffies
    only by linker script.  For -fno-semantic-interposition + Full LTO, there
    is no longer a global definition of jiffies for the compiler to produce a
    local symbol which the linker script won't ensure aliases to jiffies_64.

    usercopy: mark dma-kmalloc caches as usercopy caches
    
    commit 49f2d2419d60a103752e5fbaf158cf8d07c0d884 upstream.
    
    We have seen a "usercopy: Kernel memory overwrite attempt detected to
    SLUB object 'dma-kmalloc-1 k' (offset 0, size 11)!" error on s390x, as
    IUCV uses kmalloc() with __GFP_DMA because of memory address
    restrictions.  The issue has been discussed [2] and it has been noted
    that if all the kmalloc caches are marked as usercopy, there's little
    reason not to mark dma-kmalloc caches too.  The 'dma' part merely means
    that __GFP_DMA is used to restrict memory address range.
    
    As Jann Horn put it [3]:
     "I think dma-kmalloc slabs should be handled the same way as normal
      kmalloc slabs. When a dma-kmalloc allocation is freshly created, it is
      just normal kernel memory - even if it might later be used for DMA -,
      and it should be perfectly fine to copy_from_user() into such
      allocations at that point, and to copy_to_user() out of them at the
      end. If you look at the places where such allocations are created, you
      can see things like kmemdup(), memcpy() and so on - all normal
      operations that shouldn't conceptually be different from usercopy in
      any relevant way."
    
    Thus this patch marks the dma-kmalloc-* caches as usercopy.

    aio: fix async fsync creds
    
    commit 530f32fc370fd1431ea9802dbc53ab5601dfccdb upstream.
    
    Avi Kivity reports that on fuse filesystems running in a user namespace
    asyncronous fsync fails with EOVERFLOW.
    
    The reason is that f_ops->fsync() is called with the creds of the kthread
    performing aio work instead of the creds of the process originally
    submitting IOCB_CMD_FSYNC.
    
    Fuse sends the creds of the caller in the request header and it needs to
    translate the uid and gid into the server's user namespace.  Since the
    kthread is running in init_user_ns, the translation will fail and the
    operation returns an error.
    
    It can be argued that fsync doesn't actually need any creds, but just
    zeroing out those fields in the header (as with requests that currently
    don't take creds) is a backward compatibility risk.
    
    Instead of working around this issue in fuse, solve the core of the problem
    by calling the filesystem with the proper creds.

    [ Upstream commit 9941b8129030c9202aaf39114477a0e58c0d6ffc ]
    
    [Why]
    In some scenario like 1366x768 VSR enabled connected with a 4K monitor
    and playing 4K video in clone mode, underflow will be observed due to
    decrease dppclk when previouse surface scan isn't finished
    
    [How]
    In this use case, surface flip is switching between 4K and 1366x768,
    1366x768 needs smaller dppclk, and when decrease the clk and previous
    surface scan is for 4K and scan isn't done, underflow will happen.  Not
    doing optimize bandwidth in case of flip pending.

    scsi: target: fix hang when multiple threads try to destroy the same iscsi session
    
    [ Upstream commit 57c46e9f33da530a2485fa01aa27b6d18c28c796 ]
    
    A number of hangs have been reported against the target driver; they are
    due to the fact that multiple threads may try to destroy the iscsi session
    at the same time. This may be reproduced for example when a "targetcli
    iscsi/iqn.../tpg1 disable" command is executed while a logout operation is
    underway.
    
    When this happens, two or more threads may end up sleeping and waiting for
    iscsit_close_connection() to execute "complete(session_wait_comp)".  Only
    one of the threads will wake up and proceed to destroy the session
    structure, the remaining threads will hang forever.
    
    Note that if the blocked threads are somehow forced to wake up with
    complete_all(), they will try to free the same iscsi session structure
    destroyed by the first thread, causing double frees, memory corruptions
    etc...
    
    With this patch, the threads that want to destroy the iscsi session will
    increase the session refcount and will set the "session_close" flag to 1;
    then they wait for the driver to close the remaining active connections.
    When the last connection is closed, iscsit_close_connection() will wake up
    all the threads and will wait for the session's refcount to reach zero;
    when this happens, iscsit_close_connection() will destroy the session
    structure because no one is referencing it anymore.

    in two parts, as in "[high 11111 low]", to thwart any attempt to use these bits
    in an L1TF attack.  This works as long as there are 5 free bits between
    MAXPHYADDR and bit 50 (inclusive), leaving bit 51 free so that the MMIO
    access triggers a reserved-bit-set page fault.
    
    The bit positions however were computed wrongly for AMD processors that have
    encryption support.  In this case, x86_phys_bits is reduced (for example
    from 48 to 43, to account for the C bit at position 47 and four bits used
    internally to store the SEV ASID and other stuff) while x86_cache_bits in
    would remain set to 48, and _all_ bits between the reduced MAXPHYADDR
    and bit 51 are set.  Then low_phys_bits would also cover some of the
    bits that are set in the shadow_mmio_value, terribly confusing the gfn
    caching mechanism.
    
    To fix this, avoid splitting gfns as long as the processor does not have
    the L1TF bug (which includes all AMD processors).  When there is no
    splitting, low_phys_bits can be set to the reduced MAXPHYADDR removing
    the overlap.  This fixes "npt=0" operation on EPYC processors.
    
    Thanks to Maxim Levitsky for bisecting this bug.

    There would never have been a false positive on older hardware that

    padata: add separate cpuhp node for CPUHP_PADATA_DEAD
    
    [ Upstream commit 3c2214b6027ff37945799de717c417212e1a8c54 ]
    
    Removing the pcrypt module triggers this:

        address 0xdead000000000122
      CPU: 5 PID: 264 Comm: modprobe Not tainted 5.6.0+ #2

       pcrypt_exit+0x43/0x8ee [pcrypt]
    
    padata instances wrongly use the same hlist node for the online and dead
    states, so __padata_free()'s second cpuhp remove call chokes on the node
    that the first poisoned.
    
    cpuhp multi-instance callbacks only walk forward in cpuhp_step->list and
    the same node is linked in both the online and dead lists, so the list
    corruption that results from padata_alloc() adding the node to a second
    list without removing it from the first doesn't cause problems as long
    as no instances are freed.
    
    Avoid the issue by giving each state its own node.

    spi: dw: Fix native CS being unset
    
    [ Upstream commit 9aea644ca17b94f82ad7fa767cbc4509642f4420 ]
    
    Commit 6e0a32d6f376 ("spi: dw: Fix default polarity of native
    chipselect") attempted to fix the problem when GPIO active-high
    chip-select is utilized to communicate with some SPI slave. It fixed
    the problem, but broke the normal native CS support. At the same time
    the reversion commit ada9e3fcc175 ("spi: dw: Correct handling of native
    chipselect") didn't solve the problem either, since it just inverted
    the set_cs() polarity perception without taking into account that
    CS-high might be applicable. Here is what is done to finally fix the
    problem.
    
    DW SPI controller demands any native CS being set in order to proceed
    with data transfer. So in order to activate the SPI communications we
    must set any bit in the Slave Select DW SPI controller register no
    matter whether the platform requests the GPIO- or native CS. Preferably
    it should be the bit corresponding to the SPI slave CS number. But
    currently the dw_spi_set_cs() method activates the chip-select
    only if the second argument is false. Since the second argument of the
    set_cs callback is expected to be a boolean with "is-high" semantics
    (actual chip-select pin state value), the bit in the DW SPI Slave
    Select register will be set only if SPI core requests the driver
    to set the CS in the low state. So this will work for active-low
    GPIO-based CS case, and won't work for active-high CS setting
    the bit when SPI core actually needs to deactivate the CS.
    
    This commit fixes the problem for all described cases. So no matter
    whether an SPI slave needs GPIO- or native-based CS with active-high
    or low signal the corresponding bit will be set in SER.

    powerpc/xive: Clear the page tables for the ESB IO mapping
    
    [ Upstream commit a101950fcb78b0ba20cd487be6627dea58d55c2b ]
    
    Commit 1ca3dec2b2df ("powerpc/xive: Prevent page fault issues in the
    machine crash handler") fixed an issue in the FW assisted dump of
    machines using hash MMU and the XIVE interrupt mode under the POWER
    hypervisor. It forced the mapping of the ESB page of interrupts being
    mapped in the Linux IRQ number space to make sure the 'crash kexec'
    sequence worked during such an event. But it didn't handle the
    un-mapping.
    
    This mapping is now blocking the removal of a passthrough IO adapter
    under the POWER hypervisor because it expects the guest OS to have
    cleared all page table entries related to the adapter. If some are
    still present, the RTAS call which isolates the PCI slot returns error
    9001 "valid outstanding translations".
    
    Remove these mapping in the IRQ data cleanup routine.
    
    Under KVM, this cleanup is not required because the ESB pages for the
    adapter interrupts are un-mapped from the guest by the hypervisor in
    the KVM XIVE native device. This is now redundant but it's harmless.

    driver core: Update device link status correctly for SYNC_STATE_ONLY links
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c3e315d4296421cd26b3300ee0ac117f0877f20 ]
    
    When SYNC_STATE_ONLY support was added in commit 05ef983e0d65 ("driver
    core: Add device link support for SYNC_STATE_ONLY flag"),
    SYNC_STATE_ONLY links were treated similar to STATELESS links in terms
    of not blocking consumer probe if the supplier hasn't probed yet.
    
    That caused a SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link's status to not get updated.
    Since SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link is no longer useful once the
    consumer probes, commit 21c27f06587d ("driver core: Fix
    SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link implementation") addresses the status
    update issue by deleting the SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link instead of
    complicating the status update code.
    
    However, there are still some cases where we need to update the status
    of a SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link. This is because a SYNC_STATE_ONLY
    device link can later get converted into a normal MANAGED device link
    when a normal MANAGED device link is created between a supplier and
    consumer that already have a SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link between them.
    
    If a SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link's status isn't maintained correctly
    till it's converted to a normal MANAGED device link, then the normal
    MANAGED device link will end up with a wrong link status. This can cause
    a warning stack trace[1] when the consumer device probes successfully.
    
    This commit fixes the SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link status update issue
    where it wouldn't transition correctly from DL_STATE_DORMANT or
    DL_STATE_AVAILABLE to DL_STATE_CONSUMER_PROBE. It also resets the status
    back to DL_STATE_DORMANT or DL_STATE_AVAILABLE if the consumer probe
    fails.

    fanotify: fix ignore mask logic for events on child and on dir
    
    [ Upstream commit 2f02fd3fa13e51713b630164f8a8e5b42de8283b ]
    
    The comments in fanotify_group_event_mask() say:
    
      "If the event is on dir/child and this mark doesn't care about
       events on dir/child, don't send it!"
    
    Specifically, mount and filesystem marks do not care about events
    on child, but they can still specify an ignore mask for those events.
    For example, a group that has:
    - A mount mark with mask 0 and ignore_mask FAN_OPEN
    - An inode mark on a directory with mask FAN_OPEN | FAN_OPEN_EXEC
      with flag FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD
    
    A child file open for exec would be reported to group with the FAN_OPEN
    event despite the fact that FAN_OPEN is in ignore mask of mount mark,
    because the mark iteration loop skips over non-inode marks for events
    on child when calculating the ignore mask.
    
    Move ignore mask calculation to the top of the iteration loop block
    before excluding marks for events on dir/child.

    tcm_parent handling in dump those are not considered same parent anymore,
    which causes iproute2 tc to emit additional "parent ffff:" in first line of

    Prevent parent qdisc output when dumping filters in flower tests by always
    correctly specifying "ingress" parent both when creating and dumping

    mm: add kvfree_sensitive() for freeing sensitive data objects
    
    [ Upstream commit d4eaa2837851db2bfed572898bfc17f9a9f9151e ]
    
    For kvmalloc'ed data object that contains sensitive information like
    cryptographic keys, we need to make sure that the buffer is always cleared
    before freeing it.  Using memset() alone for buffer clearing may not
    provide certainty as the compiler may compile it away.  To be sure, the
    special memzero_explicit() has to be used.
    
    This patch introduces a new kvfree_sensitive() for freeing those sensitive
    data objects allocated by kvmalloc().  The relevant places where
    kvfree_sensitive() can be used are modified to use it.

    perf probe: Accept the instance number of kretprobe event
    
    [ Upstream commit c6aab66a728b6518772c74bd9dff66e1a1c652fd ]
    
    Since the commit 6a13a0d7b4d1 ("ftrace/kprobe: Show the maxactive number
    on kprobe_events") introduced to show the instance number of kretprobe
    events, the length of the 1st format of the kprobe event will not 1, but
    it can be longer.  This caused a parser error in perf-probe.
    
    Skip the length check the 1st format of the kprobe event to accept this
    instance number.
    
    Without this fix:
    
      # perf probe -a vfs_read%return
      Added new event:
        probe:vfs_read__return (on vfs_read%return)
    
      You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:
    
            perf record -e probe:vfs_read__return -aR sleep 1
    
      # perf probe -l
      Semantic error :Failed to parse event name: r16:probe/vfs_read__return
        Error: Failed to show event list.
    
    And with this fixes:
    
      # perf probe -a vfs_read%return
      ...
      # perf probe -l
        probe:vfs_read__return (on vfs_read%return)

    staging: mt7621-pci: properly power off dual-ported pcie phy
    
    [ Upstream commit 5fcded5e857cf66c9592e4be28c4dab4520c9177 ]
    
    Pcie phy for pcie0 and pcie1 is shared using a dual ported
    one. Current code was assuming that if nothing is connected
    in pcie0 it won't be also nothing connected in pcie1. This
    assumtion is wrong for some devices such us 'Mikrotik rbm33g'
    and 'ZyXEL LTE3301-PLUS' where only connecting a card to the
    second bus on the phy is possible. For such devices kernel
    hangs in the same point because of the wrong poweroff of the
    phy getting the following trace:
    
    mt7621-pci-phy 1e149000.pcie-phy: PHY for 0xbe149000 (dual port = 1)
    mt7621-pci-phy 1e14a000.pcie-phy: PHY for 0xbe14a000 (dual port = 0)
    mt7621-pci-phy 1e149000.pcie-phy: Xtal is 40MHz
    mt7621-pci-phy 1e14a000.pcie-phy: Xtal is 40MHz
    mt7621-pci 1e140000.pcie: pcie0 no card, disable it (RST & CLK)
    [hangs]
    
    The wrong assumption is located in the 'mt7621_pcie_init_ports'
    function where we are just making a power off of the phy for
    slots 0 and 2 if nothing is connected in them. Hence, only
    poweroff the phy if nothing is connected in both slot 0 and
    slot 1 avoiding the kernel to hang.

    [ Upstream commit 20be493b787cd581c9fffad7fcd6bfbe6af1050c ]
    
    Fix several issues in the previous gfs2_find_jhead fix:
    * When updating @blocks_submitted, @block refers to the first block block not
      submitted yet, not the last block submitted, so fix an off-by-one error.
    * We want to ensure that @blocks_submitted is far enough ahead of @blocks_read
      to guarantee that there is in-flight I/O.  Otherwise, we'll eventually end up
      waiting for pages that haven't been submitted, yet.
    * It's much easier to compare the number of blocks added with the number of
      blocks submitted to limit the maximum bio size.
    * Even with bio chaining, we can keep adding blocks until we reach the maximum
      bio size, as long as we stop at a page boundary.  This simplifies the logic.

    ARM: 8977/1: ptrace: Fix mask for thumb breakpoint hook
    
    [ Upstream commit 3866f217aaa81bf7165c7f27362eee5d7919c496 ]
    
    call_undef_hook() in traps.c applies the same instr_mask for both 16-bit
    and 32-bit thumb instructions. If instr_mask then is only 16 bits wide
    (0xffff as opposed to 0xffffffff), the first half-word of 32-bit thumb
    instructions will be masked out. This makes the function match 32-bit
    thumb instructions where the second half-word is equal to instr_val,
    regardless of the first half-word.
    
    The result in this case is that all undefined 32-bit thumb instructions
    with the second half-word equal to 0xde01 (udf #1) work as breakpoints
    and will raise a SIGTRAP instead of a SIGILL, instead of just the one
    intended 16-bit instruction. An example of such an instruction is
    0xeaa0de01, which is unallocated according to Arm ARM and should raise a
    SIGILL, but instead raises a SIGTRAP.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by setting all the bits in instr_mask, which
    will still match the intended 16-bit thumb instruction (where the
    upper half is always 0), but not any 32-bit thumb instructions.

    Input: axp20x-pek - always register interrupt handlers
    
    [ Upstream commit 9747070c11d6ae021ed7a8e96e2950ed46cd53a9 ]
    
    On some X86 devices we do not register an input-device, because the
    power-button is also handled by the soc_button_array (GPIO) input driver,
    and we want to avoid reporting power-button presses to userspace twice.
    
    Sofar when we did this we also did not register our interrupt handlers,
    since those were only necessary to report input events.
    
    But on at least 2 device models the Medion Akoya E1239T and the GPD win,
    the GPIO pin used by the soc_button_array driver for the power-button
    cannot wakeup the system from suspend. Why this does not work is not clear,
    I've tried comparing the value of all relevant registers on the Cherry
    Trail SoC, with those from models where this does work. I've checked:
    PMC registers: FUNC_DIS, FUNC_DIS2, SOIX_WAKE_EN, D3_STS_0, D3_STS_1,
    D3_STDBY_STS_0, D3_STDBY_STS_1; PMC ACPI I/O regs: PM1_STS_EN, GPE0a_EN
    and they all have identical contents in the working and non working cases.
    I suspect that the firmware either sets some unknown register to a value
    causing this, or that it turns off a power-plane which is necessary for
    GPIO wakeups to work during suspend.
    
    What does work on the Medion Akoya E1239T is letting the AXP288 wakeup
    the system on a power-button press (the GPD win has a different PMIC).
    
    Move the registering of the power-button press/release interrupt-handler
    from axp20x_pek_probe_input_device() to axp20x_pek_probe() so that the
    PMIC will wakeup the system on a power-button press, even if we do not
    register an input device.

    elfnote: mark all .note sections SHF_ALLOC
    
    commit 51da9dfb7f20911ae4e79e9b412a9c2d4c373d4b upstream.
    
    ELFNOTE_START allows callers to specify flags for .pushsection assembler
    directives.  All callsites but ELF_NOTE use "a" for SHF_ALLOC.  For vdso's
    that explicitly use ELF_NOTE_START and BUILD_SALT, the same section is
    specified twice after preprocessing, once with "a" flag, once without.
    Example:
    
    .pushsection .note.Linux, "a", @note ;
    .pushsection .note.Linux, "", @note ;
    
    While GNU as allows this ordering, it warns for the opposite ordering,
    making these directives position dependent.  We'd prefer not to precisely
    match this behavior in Clang's integrated assembler.  Instead, the non
    __ASSEMBLY__ definition of ELF_NOTE uses
    __attribute__((section(".note.Linux"))) which is created with SHF_ALLOC,
    so let's make the __ASSEMBLY__ definition of ELF_NOTE consistent with C
    and just always use "a" flag.
    
    This allows Clang to assemble a working mainline (5.6) kernel via:
    $ make CC=clang AS=clang

    bpf: Support llvm-objcopy for vmlinux BTF
    
    commit 90ceddcb495008ac8ba7a3dce297841efcd7d584 upstream.
    
    Simplify gen_btf logic to make it work with llvm-objcopy. The existing
    'file format' and 'architecture' parsing logic is brittle and does not
    work with llvm-objcopy/llvm-objdump.
    
    'file format' output of llvm-objdump>=11 will match GNU objdump, but
    'architecture' (bfdarch) may not.
    
    .BTF in .tmp_vmlinux.btf is non-SHF_ALLOC. Add the SHF_ALLOC flag
    because it is part of vmlinux image used for introspection. C code
    can reference the section via linker script defined __start_BTF and
    __stop_BTF. This fixes a small problem that previous .BTF had the
    SHF_WRITE flag (objcopy -I binary -O elf* synthesized .data).
    
    Additionally, `objcopy -I binary` synthesized symbols
    _binary__btf_vmlinux_bin_start and _binary__btf_vmlinux_bin_stop (not
    used elsewhere) are replaced with more commonplace __start_BTF and
    __stop_BTF.
    
    Add 2>/dev/null because GNU objcopy (but not llvm-objcopy) warns
    "empty loadable segment detected at vaddr=0xffffffff81000000, is this intentional?"
    
    We use a dd command to change the e_type field in the ELF header from
    ET_EXEC to ET_REL so that lld will accept .btf.vmlinux.bin.o.  Accepting
    ET_EXEC as an input file is an extremely rare GNU ld feature that lld
    does not intend to support, because this is error-prone.
    
    The output section description .BTF in include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h
    avoids potential subtle orphan section placement issues and suppresses
    --orphan-handling=warn warnings.

    This bug was bisected to commit 0a3e060f340d ("tipc: add test for Nagle
    algorithm effectiveness"). However, it is not the case, the trouble was
    from the base in the case of zero data length message sending, we would
    unexpectedly make an empty 'txq' queue after the 'tipc_msg_append()' in
    Nagle mode.
    
    A similar crash can be generated even without the bisected patch but at
    the link layer when it accesses the empty queue.
    
    We solve the issues by building at least one buffer to go with socket's
    header and an optional data section that may be empty like what we had
    with the 'tipc_msg_build()'.
    
    Note: the previous commit 4c21daae3dbc ("tipc: Fix NULL pointer
    dereference in __tipc_sendstream()") is obsoleted by this one since the
    'txq' will be never empty and the check of 'skb != NULL' is unnecessary
    but it is safe anyway.

    genetlink: fix memory leaks in genl_family_rcv_msg_dumpit()
    
    [ Upstream commit c36f05559104b66bcd7f617e931e38c680227b74 ]
    
    There are two kinds of memory leaks in genl_family_rcv_msg_dumpit():
    
    1. Before we call ops->start(), whenever an error happens, we forget
       to free the memory allocated in genl_family_rcv_msg_dumpit().
    
    2. When ops->start() fails, the 'info' has been already installed on
       the per socket control block, so we should not free it here. More
       importantly, nlk->cb_running is still false at this point, so
       netlink_sock_destruct() cannot free it either.
    
    The first kind of memory leaks is easier to resolve, but the second
    one requires some deeper thoughts.
    
    After reviewing how netfilter handles this, the most elegant solution
    I find is just to use a similar way to allocate the memory, that is,
    moving memory allocations from caller into ops->start(). With this,
    we can solve both kinds of memory leaks: for 1), no memory allocation
    happens before ops->start(); for 2), ops->start() handles its own
    failures and 'info' is installed to the socket control block only
    when success. The only ugliness here is we have to pass all local
    variables on stack via a struct, but this is not hard to understand.
    
    Alternatively, we can introduce a ops->free() to solve this too,
    but it is overkill as only genetlink has this problem so far.

    net: ena: xdp: update napi budget for DROP and ABORTED
    
    [ Upstream commit 3921a81c31df6057183aeb7f7d204003bf699d6f ]
    
    This patch fixes two issues with XDP:
    
    1. If the XDP verdict is XDP_ABORTED we break the loop, which results in
       us handling one buffer per napi cycle instead of the total budget
       (usually 64). To overcome this simply change the xdp_verdict check to
       != XDP_PASS. When the verdict is XDP_PASS, the skb is not expected to
       be NULL.
    
    2. Update the residual budget for XDP_DROP and XDP_ABORTED, since
       packets are handled in these cases.

    When sending very high packet rate, the XDP tx queues can get full and
    start dropping packets. In this case we don't free the pages which
    results in ena driver draining the system memory.
    
    Fix:
    Simply free the pages when necessary.

    vxlan: Avoid infinite loop when suppressing NS messages with invalid options
    
    [ Upstream commit 8066e6b449e050675df48e7c4b16c29f00507ff0 ]
    
    When proxy mode is enabled the vxlan device might reply to Neighbor
    Solicitation (NS) messages on behalf of remote hosts.
    
    In case the NS message includes the "Source link-layer address" option
    [1], the vxlan device will use the specified address as the link-layer
    destination address in its reply.
    
    To avoid an infinite loop, break out of the options parsing loop when
    encountering an option with length zero and disregard the NS message.
    
    This is consistent with the IPv6 ndisc code and RFC 4886 which states
    that "Nodes MUST silently discard an ND packet that contains an option
    with length zero" [2].

    tun: correct header offsets in napi frags mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 96aa1b22bd6bb9fccf62f6261f390ed6f3e7967f ]
    
    Tun in IFF_NAPI_FRAGS mode calls napi_gro_frags. Unlike netif_rx and
    netif_gro_receive, this expects skb->data to point to the mac layer.
    
    But skb_probe_transport_header, __skb_get_hash_symmetric, and
    xdp_do_generic in tun_get_user need skb->data to point to the network
    header. Flow dissection also needs skb->protocol set, so
    eth_type_trans has to be called.
    
    Ensure the link layer header lies in linear as eth_type_trans pulls
    ETH_HLEN. Then take the same code paths for frags as for not frags.
    Push the link layer header back just before calling napi_gro_frags.
    
    By pulling up to ETH_HLEN from frag0 into linear, this disables the
    frag0 optimization in the special case when IFF_NAPI_FRAGS is used
    with zero length iov[0] (and thus empty skb->linear).

    mlxsw: core: Use different get_trend() callbacks for different thermal zones
    
    [ Upstream commit 2dc2f760052da4925482ecdcdc5c94d4a599153c ]
    
    The driver registers three different types of thermal zones: For the
    ASIC itself, for port modules and for gearboxes.
    
    Currently, all three types use the same get_trend() callback which does
    not work correctly for the ASIC thermal zone. The callback assumes that
    the device data is of type 'struct mlxsw_thermal_module', whereas for
    the ASIC thermal zone 'struct mlxsw_thermal' is passed as device data.
    
    Fix this by using one get_trend() callback for the ASIC thermal zone and
    another for the other two types.

    ipv6: fix IPV6_ADDRFORM operation logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 79a1f0ccdbb4ad700590f61b00525b390cb53905 ]
    
    Socket option IPV6_ADDRFORM supports UDP/UDPLITE and TCP at present.
    Previously the checking logic looks like:
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDP || sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDPLITE)
            do_some_check;
    else if (sk->sk_protocol != IPPROTO_TCP)
            break;
    
    After commit b6f6118901d1 ("ipv6: restrict IPV6_ADDRFORM operation"), TCP
    was blocked as the logic changed to:
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDP || sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDPLITE)
            do_some_check;
    else if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_TCP)
            do_some_check;
            break;
    else
            break;
    
    Then after commit 82c9ae440857 ("ipv6: fix restrict IPV6_ADDRFORM operation")
    UDP/UDPLITE were blocked as the logic changed to:
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDP || sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDPLITE)
            do_some_check;
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_TCP)
            do_some_check;
    
    if (sk->sk_protocol != IPPROTO_TCP)
            break;
    
    Fix it by using Eric's code and simply remove the break in TCP check, which
    looks like:
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDP || sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDPLITE)
            do_some_check;
    else if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_TCP)
            do_some_check;
    else
            break;
