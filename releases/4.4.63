    MIPS: fix Select HAVE_IRQ_EXIT_ON_IRQ_STACK patch.
    
    Commit f017e58da4aba293e4a6ab62ca5d4801f79cc929 which was commit
    3cc3434fd6307d06b53b98ce83e76bf9807689b9 upstream, was misapplied to the
    4.4 stable kernel.
    
    This patch fixes this and moves the chunk to the proper Kconfig area.

    sctp: deny peeloff operation on asocs with threads sleeping on it
    
    commit dfcb9f4f99f1e9a49e43398a7bfbf56927544af1 upstream.
    
    commit 2dcab5984841 ("sctp: avoid BUG_ON on sctp_wait_for_sndbuf")
    attempted to avoid a BUG_ON call when the association being used for a
    sendmsg() is blocked waiting for more sndbuf and another thread did a
    peeloff operation on such asoc, moving it to another socket.
    
    As Ben Hutchings noticed, then in such case it would return without
    locking back the socket and would cause two unlocks in a row.
    
    Further analysis also revealed that it could allow a double free if the
    application managed to peeloff the asoc that is created during the
    sendmsg call, because then sctp_sendmsg() would try to free the asoc
    that was created only for that call.
    
    This patch takes another approach. It will deny the peeloff operation
    if there is a thread sleeping on the asoc, so this situation doesn't
    exist anymore. This avoids the issues described above and also honors
    the syscalls that are already being handled (it can be multiple sendmsg
    calls).
    
    Joint work with Xin Long.

    net: ipv6: check route protocol when deleting routes
    
    commit c2ed1880fd61a998e3ce40254a99a2ad000f1a7d upstream.
    
    The protocol field is checked when deleting IPv4 routes, but ignored for
    IPv6, which causes problems with routing daemons accidentally deleting
    externally set routes (observed by multiple bird6 users).
    
    This can be verified using `ip -6 route del <prefix> proto something`.

    tty/serial: atmel: RS485 half duplex w/DMA: enable RX after TX is done
    
    commit b389f173aaa1204d6dc1f299082a162eb0491545 upstream.
    
    When using RS485 in half duplex, RX should be enabled when TX is
    finished, and stopped when TX starts.
    
    Before commit 0058f0871efe7b01c6 ("tty/serial: atmel: fix RS485 half
    duplex with DMA"), RX was not disabled in atmel_start_tx() if the DMA
    was used. So, collisions could happened.
    
    But disabling RX in atmel_start_tx() uncovered another bug:
    RX was enabled again in the wrong place (in atmel_tx_dma) instead of
    being enabled when TX is finished (in atmel_complete_tx_dma), so the
    transmission simply stopped.
    
    This bug was not triggered before commit 0058f0871efe7b01c6
    ("tty/serial: atmel: fix RS485 half duplex with DMA") because RX was
    never disabled before.
    
    Moving atmel_start_rx() in atmel_complete_tx_dma() corrects the problem.

    SUNRPC: fix refcounting problems with auth_gss messages.
    
    commit 1cded9d2974fe4fe339fc0ccd6638b80d465ab2c upstream.
    
    There are two problems with refcounting of auth_gss messages.
    
    First, the reference on the pipe->pipe list (taken by a call
    to rpc_queue_upcall()) is not counted.  It seems to be
    assumed that a message in pipe->pipe will always also be in
    pipe->in_downcall, where it is correctly reference counted.
    
    However there is no guaranty of this.  I have a report of a
    NULL dereferences in rpc_pipe_read() which suggests a msg
    that has been freed is still on the pipe->pipe list.
    
    One way I imagine this might happen is:
    - message is queued for uid=U and auth->service=S1
    - rpc.gssd reads this message and starts processing.
      This removes the message from pipe->pipe
    - message is queued for uid=U and auth->service=S2
    - rpc.gssd replies to the first message. gss_pipe_downcall()
      calls __gss_find_upcall(pipe, U, NULL) and it finds the
      *second* message, as new messages are placed at the head
      of ->in_downcall, and the service type is not checked.
    - This second message is removed from ->in_downcall and freed
      by gss_release_msg() (even though it is still on pipe->pipe)
    - rpc.gssd tries to read another message, and dereferences a pointer
      to this message that has just been freed.
    
    I fix this by incrementing the reference count before calling
    rpc_queue_upcall(), and decrementing it if that fails, or normally in
    gss_pipe_destroy_msg().
    
    It seems strange that the reply doesn't target the message more
    precisely, but I don't know all the details.  In any case, I think the
    reference counting irregularity became a measureable bug when the
    extra arg was added to __gss_find_upcall(), hence the Fixes: line
    below.
    
    The second problem is that if rpc_queue_upcall() fails, the new
    message is not freed. gss_alloc_msg() set the ->count to 1,
    gss_add_msg() increments this to 2, gss_unhash_msg() decrements to 1,
    then the pointer is discarded so the memory never gets freed.
    
    Fixes: 9130b8dbc6ac ("SUNRPC: allow for upcalls for same uid but different gss service")

    mm: Tighten x86 /dev/mem with zeroing reads
    
    commit a4866aa812518ed1a37d8ea0c881dc946409de94 upstream.
    
    Under CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, reading System RAM through /dev/mem is
    disallowed. However, on x86, the first 1MB was always allowed for BIOS
    and similar things, regardless of it actually being System RAM. It was
    possible for heap to end up getting allocated in low 1MB RAM, and then
    read by things like x86info or dd, which would trip hardened usercopy:
    
    usercopy: kernel memory exposure attempt detected from ffff880000090000 (dma-kmalloc-256) (4096 bytes)
    
    This changes the x86 exception for the low 1MB by reading back zeros for
    System RAM areas instead of blindly allowing them. More work is needed to
    extend this to mmap, but currently mmap doesn't go through usercopy, so
    hardened usercopy won't Oops the kernel.

    rtc: tegra: Implement clock handling
    
    commit 5fa4086987506b2ab8c92f8f99f2295db9918856 upstream.
    
    Accessing the registers of the RTC block on Tegra requires the module
    clock to be enabled. This only works because the RTC module clock will
    be enabled by default during early boot. However, because the clock is
    unused, the CCF will disable it at late_init time. This causes the RTC
    to become unusable afterwards. This can easily be reproduced by trying
    to use the RTC:
    
            $ hwclock --rtc /dev/rtc1
    
    This will hang the system. I ran into this by following up on a report
    by Martin Michlmayr that reboot wasn't working on Tegra210 systems. It
    turns out that the rtc-tegra driver's ->shutdown() implementation will
    hang the CPU, because of the disabled clock, before the system can be
    rebooted.
    
    What confused me for a while is that the same driver is used on prior
    Tegra generations where the hang can not be observed. However, as Peter
    De Schrijver pointed out, this is because on 32-bit Tegra chips the RTC
    clock is enabled by the tegra20_timer.c clocksource driver, which uses
    the RTC to provide a persistent clock. This code is never enabled on
    64-bit Tegra because the persistent clock infrastructure does not exist
    on 64-bit ARM.
    
    The proper fix for this is to add proper clock handling to the RTC
    driver in order to ensure that the clock is enabled when the driver
    requires it. All device trees contain the clock already, therefore
    no additional changes are required.

    platform/x86: acer-wmi: setup accelerometer when machine has appropriate notify event
    
    commit 98d610c3739ac354319a6590b915f4624d9151e6 upstream.
    
    The accelerometer event relies on the ACERWMID_EVENT_GUID notify.
    So, this patch changes the codes to setup accelerometer input device
    when detected ACERWMID_EVENT_GUID. It avoids that the accel input
    device created on every Acer machines.
    
    In addition, patch adds a clearly parsing logic of accelerometer hid
    to acer_wmi_get_handle_cb callback function. It is positive matching
    the "SENR" name with "BST0001" device to avoid non-supported hardware.

    dvb-usb-v2: avoid use-after-free
    
    commit 005145378c9ad7575a01b6ce1ba118fb427f583a upstream.
    
    I ran into a stack frame size warning because of the on-stack copy of
    the USB device structure:
    
    drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/dvb_usb_core.c: In function 'dvb_usbv2_disconnect':
    drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/dvb_usb_core.c:1029:1: error: the frame size of 1104 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
    
    Copying a device structure like this is wrong for a number of other reasons
    too aside from the possible stack overflow. One of them is that the
    dev_info() call will print the name of the device later, but AFAICT
    we have only copied a pointer to the name earlier and the actual name
    has been freed by the time it gets printed.
    
    This removes the on-stack copy of the device and instead copies the
    device name using kstrdup(). I'm ignoring the possible failure here
    as both printk() and kfree() are able to deal with NULL pointers.

    crypto: ahash - Fix EINPROGRESS notification callback
    
    commit ef0579b64e93188710d48667cb5e014926af9f1b upstream.
    
    The ahash API modifies the request's callback function in order
    to clean up after itself in some corner cases (unaligned final
    and missing finup).
    
    When the request is complete ahash will restore the original
    callback and everything is fine.  However, when the request gets
    an EBUSY on a full queue, an EINPROGRESS callback is made while
    the request is still ongoing.
    
    In this case the ahash API will incorrectly call its own callback.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by creating a temporary request
    object on the stack which is used to relay EINPROGRESS back to
    the original completion function.
    
    This patch also adds code to preserve the original flags value.

    powerpc: Disable HFSCR[TM] if TM is not supported
    
    commit 7ed23e1bae8bf7e37fd555066550a00b95a3a98b upstream.
    
    On Power8 & Power9 the early CPU inititialisation in __init_HFSCR()
    turns on HFSCR[TM] (Hypervisor Facility Status and Control Register
    [Transactional Memory]), but that doesn't take into account that TM
    might be disabled by CPU features, or disabled by the kernel being built
    with CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n.
    
    So later in boot, when we have setup the CPU features, clear HSCR[TM] if
    the TM CPU feature has been disabled. We use CPU_FTR_TM_COMP to account
    for the CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n case.
    
    Without this a KVM guest might try use TM, even if told not to, and
    cause an oops in the host kernel. Typically the oops is seen in
    __kvmppc_vcore_entry() and may or may not be fatal to the host, but is
    always bad news.
    
    In practice all shipping CPU revisions do support TM, and all host
    kernels we are aware of build with TM support enabled, so no one should
    actually be able to hit this in the wild.

    zram: do not use copy_page with non-page aligned address
    
    commit d72e9a7a93e4f8e9e52491921d99e0c8aa89eb4e upstream.
    
    The copy_page is optimized memcpy for page-alinged address.  If it is
    used with non-page aligned address, it can corrupt memory which means
    system corruption.  With zram, it can happen with
    
    1. 64K architecture
    2. partial IO
    3. slub debug
    
    Partial IO need to allocate a page and zram allocates it via kmalloc.
    With slub debug, kmalloc(PAGE_SIZE) doesn't return page-size aligned
    address.  And finally, copy_page(mem, cmem) corrupts memory.
    
    So, this patch changes it to memcpy.
    
    Actuaully, we don't need to change zram_bvec_write part because zsmalloc
    returns page-aligned address in case of PAGE_SIZE class but it's not
    good to rely on the internal of zsmalloc.
    
    Note:
     When this patch is merged to stable, clear_page should be fixed, too.
     Unfortunately, recent zram removes it by "same page merge" feature so
     it's hard to backport this patch to -stable tree.
    
    I will handle it when I receive the mail from stable tree maintainer to
    merge this patch to backport.

    char: Drop bogus dependency of DEVPORT on !M68K
    
    commit 309124e2648d668a0c23539c5078815660a4a850 upstream.
    
    According to full-history-linux commit d3794f4fa7c3edc3 ("[PATCH] M68k
    update (part 25)"), port operations are allowed on m68k if CONFIG_ISA is
    defined.
    
    However, commit 153dcc54df826d2f ("[PATCH] mem driver: fix conditional
    on isa i/o support") accidentally changed an "||" into an "&&",
    disabling it completely on m68k. This logic was retained when
    introducing the DEVPORT symbol in commit 4f911d64e04a44c4 ("Make
    /dev/port conditional on config symbol").
    
    Drop the bogus dependency on !M68K to fix this.

    ftrace: Fix removing of second function probe
    
    commit 82cc4fc2e70ec5baeff8f776f2773abc8b2cc0ae upstream.
    
    When two function probes are added to set_ftrace_filter, and then one of
    them is removed, the update to the function locations is not performed, and
    the record keeping of the function states are corrupted, and causes an
    ftrace_bug() to occur.
    
    This is easily reproducable by adding two probes, removing one, and then
    adding it back again.

    Connecting to the backend isn't working reliably in xen-fbfront: in
    case XenbusStateInitWait of the backend has been missed the backend
    transition to XenbusStateConnected will trigger the connected state

    commit 7c856152cb92f8eee2df29ef325a1b1f43161aff upstream.
    
    We previously made sure that the reported disk capacity was less than
    0xffffffff blocks when the kernel was not compiled with large sector_t
    support (CONFIG_LBDAF). However, this check assumed that the capacity
    was reported in units of 512 bytes.
    
    Add a sanity check function to ensure that we only enable disks if the
    entire reported capacity can be expressed in terms of sector_t.

    iscsi-target: Drop work-around for legacy GlobalSAN initiator
    
    commit 1c99de981f30b3e7868b8d20ce5479fa1c0fea46 upstream.
    
    Once upon a time back in 2009, a work-around was added to support
    the GlobalSAN iSCSI initiator v3.3 for MacOSX, which during login
    did not propose nor respond to MaxBurstLength, FirstBurstLength,
    DefaultTime2Wait and DefaultTime2Retain keys.
    
    The work-around in iscsi_check_proposer_for_optional_reply()
    allowed the missing keys to be proposed, but did not require
    waiting for a response before moving to full feature phase
    operation.  This allowed GlobalSAN v3.3 to work out-of-the
    box, and for many years we didn't run into login interopt
    issues with any other initiators..
    
    Until recently, when Martin tried a QLogic 57840S iSCSI Offload
    HBA on Windows 2016 which completed login, but subsequently
    failed with:
    
        Got unknown iSCSI OpCode: 0x43
    
    The issue was QLogic MSFT side did not propose DefaultTime2Wait +
    DefaultTime2Retain, so LIO proposes them itself, and immediately
    transitions to full feature phase because of the GlobalSAN hack.
    However, the QLogic MSFT side still attempts to respond to
    DefaultTime2Retain + DefaultTime2Wait, even though LIO has set
    ISCSI_FLAG_LOGIN_NEXT_STAGE3 + ISCSI_FLAG_LOGIN_TRANSIT
    in last login response.
    
    So while the QLogic MSFT side should have been proposing these
    two keys to start, it was doing the correct thing per RFC-3720
    attempting to respond to proposed keys before transitioning to
    full feature phase.
    
    All that said, recent versions of GlobalSAN iSCSI (v5.3.0.541)
    does correctly propose the four keys during login, making the
    original work-around moot.
    
    So in order to allow QLogic MSFT to run unmodified as-is, go
    ahead and drop this long standing work-around.

    iscsi-target: Fix TMR reference leak during session shutdown
    
    commit efb2ea770bb3b0f40007530bc8b0c22f36e1c5eb upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a iscsi-target specific TMR reference leak
    during session shutdown, that could occur when a TMR was
    quiesced before the hand-off back to iscsi-target code
    via transport_cmd_check_stop_to_fabric().
    
    The reference leak happens because iscsit_free_cmd() was
    incorrectly skipping the final target_put_sess_cmd() for
    TMRs when transport_generic_free_cmd() returned zero because
    the se_cmd->cmd_kref did not reach zero, due to the missing
    se_cmd assignment in original code.
    
    The result was iscsi_cmd and it's associated se_cmd memory
    would be freed once se_sess->sess_cmd_map where released,
    but the associated se_tmr_req was leaked and remained part
    of se_device->dev_tmr_list.
    
    This bug would manfiest itself as kernel paging request
    OOPsen in core_tmr_lun_reset(), when a left-over se_tmr_req
    attempted to dereference it's se_cmd pointer that had
    already been released during normal session shutdown.
    
    To address this bug, go ahead and treat ISCSI_OP_SCSI_CMD
    and ISCSI_OP_SCSI_TMFUNC the same when there is an extra
    se_cmd->cmd_kref to drop in iscsit_free_cmd(), and use
    op_scsi to signal __iscsit_free_cmd() when the former
    needs to clear any further iscsi related I/O state.

    acpi, nfit, libnvdimm: fix interleave set cookie calculation (64-bit comparison)
    
    commit b03b99a329a14b7302f37c3ea6da3848db41c8c5 upstream.
    
    While reviewing the -stable patch for commit 86ef58a4e35e "nfit,
    libnvdimm: fix interleave set cookie calculation" Ben noted:
    
        "This is returning an int, thus it's effectively doing a 32-bit
         comparison and not the 64-bit comparison you say is needed."
    
    Update the compare operation to be immune to this integer demotion problem.

    x86/vdso: Ensure vdso32_enabled gets set to valid values only
    
    commit c06989da39cdb10604d572c8c7ea8c8c97f3c483 upstream.
    
    vdso_enabled can be set to arbitrary integer values via the kernel command
    line 'vdso32=' parameter or via 'sysctl abi.vsyscall32'.
    
    load_vdso32() only maps VDSO if vdso_enabled == 1, but ARCH_DLINFO_IA32
    merily checks for vdso_enabled != 0. As a consequence the AT_SYSINFO_EHDR
    auxiliary vector for the VDSO_ENTRY is emitted with a NULL pointer which
    causes a segfault when the application tries to use the VDSO.
    
    Restrict the valid arguments on the command line and the sysctl to 0 and 1.

    CIFS: store results of cifs_reopen_file to avoid infinite wait
    
    commit 1fa839b4986d648b907d117275869a0e46c324b9 upstream.
    
    This fixes Continuous Availability when errors during
    file reopen are encountered.
    
    cifs_user_readv and cifs_user_writev would wait for ever if
    results of cifs_reopen_file are not stored and for later inspection.
    
    In fact, results are checked and, in case of errors, a chain
    of function calls leading to reads and writes to be scheduled in
    a separate thread is skipped.
    These threads will wake up the corresponding waiters once reads
    and writes are done.
    
    However, given the return value is not stored, when rc is checked
    for errors a previous one (always zero) is inspected instead.
    This leads to pending reads/writes added to the list, making
    cifs_user_readv and cifs_user_writev wait for ever.

    drm/nouveau/mmu/nv4a: use nv04 mmu rather than the nv44 one
    
    commit f94773b9f5ecd1df7c88c2e921924dd41d2020cc upstream.
    
    The NV4A (aka NV44A) is an oddity in the family. It only comes in AGP
    and PCI varieties, rather than a core PCIE chip with a bridge for
    AGP/PCI as necessary. As a result, it appears that the MMU is also
    non-functional. For AGP cards, the vast majority of the NV4A lineup,
    this worked out since we force AGP cards to use the nv04 mmu. However
    for PCI variants, this did not work.
    
    Switching to the NV04 MMU makes it work like a charm. Thanks to mwk for
    the suggestion. This should be a no-op for NV4A AGP boards, as they were
    using it already.

    cgroup, kthread: close race window where new kthreads can be migrated to non-root cgroups
    
    commit 77f88796cee819b9c4562b0b6b44691b3b7755b1 upstream.
    
    Creation of a kthread goes through a couple interlocked stages between
    the kthread itself and its creator.  Once the new kthread starts
    running, it initializes itself and wakes up the creator.  The creator
    then can further configure the kthread and then let it start doing its
    job by waking it up.
    
    In this configuration-by-creator stage, the creator is the only one
    that can wake it up but the kthread is visible to userland.  When
    altering the kthread's attributes from userland is allowed, this is
    fine; however, for cases where CPU affinity is critical,
    kthread_bind() is used to first disable affinity changes from userland
    and then set the affinity.  This also prevents the kthread from being
    migrated into non-root cgroups as that can affect the CPU affinity and
    many other things.
    
    Unfortunately, the cgroup side of protection is racy.  While the
    PF_NO_SETAFFINITY flag prevents further migrations, userland can win
    the race before the creator sets the flag with kthread_bind() and put
    the kthread in a non-root cgroup, which can lead to all sorts of
    problems including incorrect CPU affinity and starvation.
    
    This bug got triggered by userland which periodically tries to migrate
    all processes in the root cpuset cgroup to a non-root one.  Per-cpu
    workqueue workers got caught while being created and ended up with
    incorrected CPU affinity breaking concurrency management and sometimes
    stalling workqueue execution.
    
    This patch adds task->no_cgroup_migration which disallows the task to
    be migrated by userland.  kthreadd starts with the flag set making
    every child kthread start in the root cgroup with migration
    disallowed.  The flag is cleared after the kthread finishes
    initialization by which time PF_NO_SETAFFINITY is set if the kthread
    should stay in the root cgroup.
    
    It'd be better to wait for the initialization instead of failing but I
    couldn't think of a way of implementing that without adding either a
    new PF flag, or sleeping and retrying from waiting side.  Even if
    userland depends on changing cgroup membership of a kthread, it either
    has to be synchronized with kthread_create() or periodically repeat,
    so it's unlikely that this would break anything.
    
    v2: Switch to a simpler implementation using a new task_struct bit
        field suggested by Oleg.
