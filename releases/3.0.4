    Linux 3.0.4

    Add a personality to report 2.6.x version numbers
    
    commit be27425dcc516fd08245b047ea57f83b8f6f0903 upstream.
    
    I ran into a couple of programs which broke with the new Linux 3.0
    version.  Some of those were binary only.  I tried to use LD_PRELOAD to
    work around it, but it was quite difficult and in one case impossible
    because of a mix of 32bit and 64bit executables.
    
    For example, all kind of management software from HP doesnt work, unless
    we pretend to run a 2.6 kernel.
    
      $ uname -a
      Linux svivoipvnx001 3.0.0-08107-g97cd98f #1062 SMP Fri Aug 12 18:11:45 CEST 2011 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
    
      $ hpacucli ctrl all show
    
      Error: No controllers detected.
    
      $ rpm -qf /usr/sbin/hpacucli
      hpacucli-8.75-12.0
    
    Another notable case is that Python now reports "linux3" from
    sys.platform(); which in turn can break things that were checking
    sys.platform() == "linux2":
    
      https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=664564
    
    It seems pretty clear to me though it's a bug in the apps that are using
    '==' instead of .startswith(), but this allows us to unbreak broken
    programs.
    
    This patch adds a UNAME26 personality that makes the kernel report a
    2.6.40+x version number instead.  The x is the x in 3.x.
    
    I know this is somewhat ugly, but I didn't find a better workaround, and
    compatibility to existing programs is important.
    
    Some programs also read /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease.  This can be worked
    around in user space with mount --bind (and a mount namespace)
    
    To use:
    
      wget ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/ak/uname26/uname26.c
      gcc -o uname26 uname26.c
      ./uname26 program

    x86-32, vdso: On system call restart after SYSENTER, use int $0x80
    
    commit 7ca0758cdb7c241cb4e0490a8d95f0eb5b861daf upstream.
    
    When we enter a 32-bit system call via SYSENTER or SYSCALL, we shuffle
    the arguments to match the int $0x80 calling convention.  This was
    probably a design mistake, but it's what it is now.  This causes
    errors if the system call as to be restarted.
    
    For SYSENTER, we have to invoke the instruction from the vdso as the
    return address is hardcoded.  Accordingly, we can simply replace the
    jump in the vdso with an int $0x80 instruction and use the slower
    entry point for a post-restart.

    x86, olpc: Wait for last byte of EC command to be accepted
    
    commit a3ea14df0e383f44dcb2e61badb71180dbffe526 upstream.
    
    When executing EC commands, only waiting when there are still
    more bytes to write is usually fine. However, if the system
    suspends very quickly after a call to olpc_ec_cmd(), the last
    data byte may not yet be transferred to the EC, and the command
    will not complete.
    
    This solves a bug where the SCI wakeup mask was not correctly
    written when going into suspend.
    
    It means that sometimes, on XO-1.5 (but not XO-1), the
    devices that were marked as wakeup sources can't wake up
    the system. e.g. you ask for wifi wakeups, suspend, but then
    incoming wifi frames don't wake up the system as they should.

    xen/x86: replace order-based range checking of M2P table by linear one
    
    commit ccbcdf7cf1b5f6c6db30d84095b9c6c53043af55 upstream.
    
    The order-based approach is not only less efficient (requiring a shift
    and a compare, typical generated code looking like this
    
            mov     eax, [machine_to_phys_order]
            mov     ecx, eax
            shr     ebx, cl
            test    ebx, ebx
            jnz     ...
    
    whereas a direct check requires just a compare, like in
    
            cmp     ebx, [machine_to_phys_nr]
            jae     ...
    
    ), but also slightly dangerous in the 32-on-64 case - the element
    address calculation can wrap if the next power of two boundary is
    sufficiently far away from the actual upper limit of the table, and
    hence can result in user space addresses being accessed (with it being
    unknown what may actually be mapped there).
    
    Additionally, the elimination of the mistaken use of fls() here (should
    have been __fls()) fixes a latent issue on x86-64 that would trigger
    if the code was run on a system with memory extending beyond the 44-bit
    boundary.

    These were intended to avoid the namespace clash when representing
    emulated IDE and SCSI devices. However that seems to confuse users
    more than expected (a disk defined as sda becomes xvde).
    So for now go back to the scheme which does no adjustments. This
    will break when mixing IDE and SCSI names in the configuration of
    guests but should be by now expected.

    ext4: fix nomblk_io_submit option so it correctly converts uninit blocks
    
    commit 9dd75f1f1a02d656a11a7b9b9e6c2759b9c1e946 upstream.
    
    Bug discovered by Jan Kara:
    
    Finally, commit 1449032be17abb69116dbc393f67ceb8bd034f92 returned back
    the old IO submission code but apparently it forgot to return the old
    handling of uninitialized buffers so we unconditionnaly call
    block_write_full_page() without specifying end_io function. So AFAICS
    we never convert unwritten extents to written in some cases. For
    example when I mount the fs as: mount -t ext4 -o
    nomblk_io_submit,dioread_nolock /dev/ubdb /mnt and do
            int fd = open(argv[1], O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0600);
            char buf[1024];
            memset(buf, 'a', sizeof(buf));
            fallocate(fd, 0, 0, 16384);
            write(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
    
    I get a file full of zeros (after remounting the filesystem so that
    pagecache is dropped) instead of seeing the first KB contain 'a's.

    EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag set and the increase of i_aiodio_unwritten

    We don't increase i_aiodio_unwritten when setting

    to wait forever.

    ext4: call ext4_ioend_wait and ext4_flush_completed_IO in ext4_evict_inode
    
    commit 2581fdc810889fdea97689cb62481201d579c796 upstream.
    
    Flush inode's i_completed_io_list before calling ext4_io_wait to
    prevent the following deadlock scenario: A page fault happens while
    some process is writing inode A. During page fault,
    shrink_icache_memory is called that in turn evicts another inode
    B. Inode B has some pending io_end work so it calls ext4_ioend_wait()
    that waits for inode B's i_ioend_count to become zero. However, inode
    B's ioend work was queued behind some of inode A's ioend work on the
    same cpu's ext4-dio-unwritten workqueue. As the ext4-dio-unwritten
    thread on that cpu is processing inode A's ioend work, it tries to
    grab inode A's i_mutex lock. Since the i_mutex lock of inode A is
    still hold before the page fault happened, we enter a deadlock.
    
    Also moves ext4_flush_completed_IO and ext4_ioend_wait from
    ext4_destroy_inode() to ext4_evict_inode(). During inode deleteion,
    ext4_evict_inode() is called before ext4_destroy_inode() and in
    ext4_evict_inode(), we may call ext4_truncate() without holding
    i_mutex lock. As a result, there is a race between flush_completed_IO
    that is called from ext4_ext_truncate() and ext4_end_io_work, which
    may cause corruption on an io_end structure. This change moves
    ext4_flush_completed_IO and ext4_ioend_wait from ext4_destroy_inode()
    to ext4_evict_inode() to resolve the race between ext4_truncate() and

    ext4: Fix ext4_should_writeback_data() for no-journal mode
    
    commit 441c850857148935babe000fc2ba1455fe54a6a9 upstream.
    
    ext4_should_writeback_data() had an incorrect sequence of
    tests to determine if it should return 0 or 1: in
    particular, even in no-journal mode, 0 was being returned
    for a non-regular-file inode.
    
    This meant that, in non-journal mode, we would use
    ext4_journalled_aops for directories, symlinks, and other
    non-regular files.  However, calling journalled aop
    callbacks when there is no valid handle, can cause problems.
    
    This would cause a kernel crash with Jan Kara's commit
    2d859db3e4 ("ext4: fix data corruption in inodes with
    journalled data"), because we now dereference 'handle' in
    ext4_journalled_write_end().
    
    I also added BUG_ONs to check for a valid handle in the
    obviously journal-only aops callbacks.
    
    I tested this running xfstests with a scratch device in
    these modes:
    
       - no-journal
       - data=ordered
       - data=writeback
       - data=journal
    
    All work fine; the data=journal run has many failures and a
    crash in xfstests 074, but this is no different from a
    vanilla kernel.

    ALSA: snd_usb_caiaq: track submitted output urbs
    
    commit da6094ea7d3c2295473d8f5134279307255d6ebf upstream.
    
    The snd_usb_caiaq driver currently assumes that output urbs are serviced
    in time and doesn't track when and whether they are given back by the
    USB core. That usually works fine, but due to temporary limitations of
    the XHCI stack, we faced that urbs were submitted more than once with
    this approach.
    
    As it's no good practice to fire and forget urbs anyway, this patch
    introduces a proper bit mask to track which requests have been submitted
    and given back.
    
    That alone however doesn't make the driver work in case the host
    controller is broken and doesn't give back urbs at all, and the output
    stream will stop once all pre-allocated output urbs are consumed. But
    it does prevent crashes of the controller stack in such cases.
    
    See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40702 for more details.

    ALSA: usb-audio - Fix missing mixer dB information
    
    commit 38b65190c6ab0be8ce7cff69e734ca5b5e7fa309 upstream.
    
    The recent fix for testing dB range at the mixer creation time seems
    to cause regressions in some devices.  In such devices, reading the dB
    info at probing time gives an error, thus both dBmin and dBmax are still
    zero, and TLV flag isn't set although the later read of dB info succeeds.
    
    This patch adds a workaround for such a case by assuming that the later
    read will succeed.  In future, a similar test should be performed in a
    case where a wrong dB range is seen even in the later read.

    loop: fix deadlock when sysfs and LOOP_CLR_FD race against each other
    
    commit 05eb0f252b04aa94ace0794f73d56c6a02351d80 upstream.
    
    LOOP_CLR_FD takes lo->lo_ctl_mutex and tries to remove the loop sysfs
    files. Sysfs calls show() and waits for lo->lo_ctl_mutex. LOOP_CLR_FD
    waits for show() to finish to remove the sysfs file.

    Btrfs: detect wether a device supports discard
    
    commit d5e2003c2bcda93a8f2e668eb4642d70c9c38301 upstream.
    
    We have a problem where if a user specifies discard but doesn't actually support
    it we will return EOPNOTSUPP from btrfs_discard_extent.  This is a problem
    because this gets called (in a fashion) from the tree log recovery code, which
    has a nice little BUG_ON(ret) after it, which causes us to fail the tree log
    replay.  So instead detect wether our devices support discard when we're adding
    them and then don't issue discards if we know that the device doesn't support
    it.  And just for good measure set ret = 0 in btrfs_issue_discard just in case
    we still get EOPNOTSUPP so we don't screw anybody up like this again.  Thanks,

    x86, mtrr: lock stop machine during MTRR rendezvous sequence
    
    commit 6d3321e8e2b3bf6a5892e2ef673c7bf536e3f904 upstream.
    
    MTRR rendezvous sequence using stop_one_cpu_nowait() can potentially
    happen in parallel with another system wide rendezvous using
    stop_machine(). This can lead to deadlock (The order in which
    works are queued can be different on different cpu's. Some cpu's
    will be running the first rendezvous handler and others will be running
    the second rendezvous handler. Each set waiting for the other set to join
    for the system wide rendezvous, leading to a deadlock).
    
    MTRR rendezvous sequence is not implemented using stop_machine() as this
    gets called both from the process context aswell as the cpu online paths
    (where the cpu has not come online and the interrupts are disabled etc).
    stop_machine() works with only online cpus.
    
    For now, take the stop_machine mutex in the MTRR rendezvous sequence that
    gets called from an online cpu (here we are in the process context
    and can potentially sleep while taking the mutex). And the MTRR rendezvous
    that gets triggered during cpu online doesn't need to take this stop_machine
    lock (as the stop_machine() already ensures that there is no cpu hotplug
    going on in parallel by doing get_online_cpus())
    
        TBD: Pursue a cleaner solution of extending the stop_machine()
             infrastructure to handle the case where the calling cpu is
             still not online and use this for MTRR rendezvous sequence.

    NFSv4.1: Return NFS4ERR_BADSESSION to callbacks during session resets
    
    commit 910ac68a2b80c7de95bc8488734067b1bb15d583 upstream.
    
    If the client is in the process of resetting the session when it receives
    a callback, then returning NFS4ERR_DELAY may cause a deadlock with the
    DESTROY_SESSION call.
    
    Basically, if the client returns NFS4ERR_DELAY in response to the
    CB_SEQUENCE call, then the server is entitled to believe that the
    client is busy because it is already processing that call. In that
    case, the server is perfectly entitled to respond with a
    NFS4ERR_BACK_CHAN_BUSY to any DESTROY_SESSION call.
    
    Fix this by having the client reply with a NFS4ERR_BADSESSION in
    response to the callback if it is resetting the session.

    NFSv4.1: Fix the callback 'highest_used_slotid' behaviour
    
    commit 55a673990ec04cf63005318bcf08c2b0046e5778 upstream.
    
    Currently, there is no guarantee that we will call nfs4_cb_take_slot() even
    though nfs4_callback_compound() will consistently call
    nfs4_cb_free_slot() provided the cb_process_state has set the 'clp' field.
    The result is that we can trigger the BUG_ON() upon the next call to
    nfs4_cb_take_slot().
    
    This patch fixes the above problem by using the slot id that was taken in
    the CB_SEQUENCE operation as a flag for whether or not we need to call
    nfs4_cb_free_slot().
    It also fixes an atomicity problem: we need to set tbl->highest_used_slotid
    atomically with the check for NFS4_SESSION_DRAINING, otherwise we end up
    racing with the various tests in nfs4_begin_drain_session().

    pnfs-obj: Bug when we are running out of bio
    
    commit 20618b21da0796115e81906d24ff1601552701b7 upstream.
    
    When we have a situation that the number of pages we want
    to encode is bigger then the size of the bio. (Which can
    currently happen only when all IO is going to a single device
    .e.g group_width==1) then the IO is submitted short and we
    report back only the amount of bytes we actually wrote/read
    and all is fine. BUT ...
    
    There was a bug that the current length counter was advanced
    before the fail to add the extra page, and we come to a situation
    that the CDB length was one-page longer then the actual bio size,
    which is of course rejected by the osd-target.
    
    While here also fix the bio size calculation, in the case
    that we received more then one group of devices.

    this occurred. That means that the read_seqretry returned true.
    
    Assuming that the comment inside the if statement is true, this should
    be harmless and just means that we raced with a rename. If that is the
    case, then there's no need for alarm and we can demote this to cFYI.
    
    While we're at it, print the dfsplen too so that we can see what
    happened here if the message pops during debugging.
