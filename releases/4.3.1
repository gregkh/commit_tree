    xen/events: Always allocate legacy interrupts on PV guests
    
    commit b4ff8389ed14b849354b59ce9b360bdefcdbf99c upstream.
    
    After commit 8c058b0b9c34 ("x86/irq: Probe for PIC presence before
    allocating descs for legacy IRQs") early_irq_init() will no longer
    preallocate descriptors for legacy interrupts if PIC does not
    exist, which is the case for Xen PV guests.
    
    Therefore we may need to allocate those descriptors ourselves.

    staging/lustre: use jiffies for lp_last_query times
    
    commit 9f088dba3cc267ea11ec0da318cd0175575b5f9b upstream.
    
    The recently introduced lnet_peer_set_alive() function uses
    get_seconds() to read the current time into a shared variable,
    but all other uses of that variable compare it to jiffies values.
    
    This changes the current use to jiffies as well for consistency.

    xhci: Workaround to get Intel xHCI reset working more reliably
    
    commit a5964396190d0c40dd549c23848c282fffa5d1f2 upstream.
    
    Existing Intel xHCI controllers require a delay of 1 mS,
    after setting the CMD_RESET bit in command register, before
    accessing any HC registers. This allows the HC to complete
    the reset operation and be ready for HC register access.
    Without this delay, the subsequent HC register access,
    may result in a system hang, very rarely.
    
    Verified CherryView / Braswell platforms go through over
    5000 warm reboot cycles (which was not possible without
    this patch), without any xHCI reset hang.

    ttyFDC: Fix build problems due to use of module_{init,exit}
    
    commit 3e8137a185240fa6da0ff91cd9c604716371903b upstream.
    
    Commit 0fd972a7d91d (module: relocate module_init from init.h to
    module.h) broke the build of ttyFDC driver due to that driver's (mis)use
    of module_mips_cdmm_driver() without first including module.h, for
    example:
    
    In file included from ./arch/mips/include/asm/cdmm.h +11 :0,

    Instead of just adding the module.h include, switch to using the new
    builtin_mips_cdmm_driver() helper macro and drop the remove callback,
    since it isn't needed. If module support is added later, the code can
    always be resurrected.

    ALSA: usb-audio: work around CH345 input SysEx corruption
    
    commit a91e627e3f0ed820b11d86cdc04df38f65f33a70 upstream.
    
    One of the many faults of the QinHeng CH345 USB MIDI interface chip is
    that it does not handle received SysEx messages correctly -- every second
    event packet has a wrong code index number, which is the one from the last
    seen message, instead of 4.  For example, the two messages "FE F0 01 02 03
    04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E F7" result in the following event
    packets:
    
    correct:       CH345:
    0F FE 00 00    0F FE 00 00
    04 F0 01 02    04 F0 01 02
    04 03 04 05    0F 03 04 05
    04 06 07 08    04 06 07 08
    04 09 0A 0B    0F 09 0A 0B
    04 0C 0D 0E    04 0C 0D 0E
    05 F7 00 00    05 F7 00 00
    
    A class-compliant driver must interpret an event packet with CIN 15 as
    having a single data byte, so the other two bytes would be ignored.  The
    message received by the host would then be missing two bytes out of six;
    in this example, "F0 01 02 03 06 07 08 09 0C 0D 0E F7".
    
    These corrupted SysEx event packages contain only data bytes, while the
    CH345 uses event packets with a correct CIN value only for messages with
    a status byte, so it is possible to distinguish between these two cases by
    checking for the presence of this status byte.
    
    (Other bugs in the CH345's input handling, such as the corruption resulting
    from running status, cannot be worked around.)

    ALSA: usb-audio: prevent CH345 multiport output SysEx corruption
    
    commit 1ca8b201309d842642f221db7f02f71c0af5be2d upstream.
    
    The CH345 USB MIDI chip has two output ports.  However, they are
    multiplexed through one pin, and the number of ports cannot be reduced
    even for hardware that implements only one connector, so for those
    devices, data sent to either port ends up on the same hardware output.
    This becomes a problem when both ports are used at the same time, as
    longer MIDI commands (such as SysEx messages) are likely to be
    interrupted by messages from the other port, and thus to get lost.
    
    It would not be possible for the driver to detect how many ports the
    device actually has, except that in practice, _all_ devices built with
    the CH345 have only one port.  So we can just ignore the device's
    descriptors, and hardcode one output port.

    usb: xhci: fix checking ep busy for CFC
    
    commit 42df7215facf27be8d53e657dd4a12d4ebad0a44 upstream.
    
    Function ep_ring_is_processing() checks the dequeue pointer
    in endpoint context to know whether an endpoint is busy with
    processing TRBs. This is not correct since dequeue pointer
    field in an endpoint context is only valid when the endpoint
    is in Halted or Stopped states. This buggy code causes audio
    noise when playing sound with USB headset connected to host
    controllers which support CFC (one of xhci 1.1 features).
    
    This patch should exist in stable kernel since v4.3.

    usb: musb: core: fix order of arguments to ulpi write callback
    
    commit 705e63d2b29c8bbf091119084544d353bda70393 upstream.
    
    There is a bit of a mess in the order of arguments to the ulpi write
    callback. There is
    
            int ulpi_write(struct ulpi *ulpi, u8 addr, u8 val)
    
    in drivers/usb/common/ulpi.c;

                    ...
                    int (*write)(struct usb_phy *x, u32 val, u32 reg);
            }
    
    in include/linux/usb/phy.h.
    
    The callback registered by the musb driver has to comply to the latter,
    but up to now had "offset" first which effectively made the function
    broken for correct users. So flip the order and while at it also
    switch to the parameter names of struct usb_phy_io_ops's write.

    USB: qcserial: Fix support for HP lt4112 LTE/HSPA+ Gobi 4G Modem
    
    commit 59536da34513c594af2a6fd35ba65ea45b6960a1 upstream.
    
    The DEVICE_HWI type was added under the faulty assumption that Huawei
    devices based on Qualcomm chipsets and firmware use the static USB
    interface numbering known from Gobi devices.  But this model does
    not apply to Huawei devices like the HP branded lt4112 (Huawei me906e).
    Huawei firmwares will dynamically assign interface numbers. Functions
    are renumbered when the firmware is reconfigured.
    
    Fix by changing the DEVICE_HWI type to use a simplified version
    of Huawei's subclass + protocol scheme: Blacklisting known network
    interface combinations and assuming the rest are serial.

    usblp: do not set TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE before lock
    
    commit 19cd80a214821f4b558560ebd76bfb2c38b4f3d8 upstream.
    
    It is not permitted to set task state before lock. usblp_wwait sets
    the state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and calls mutex_lock_interruptible.
    Upon return from that function, the state will be TASK_RUNNING again.
    
    This is clearly a bug and a warning is generated with LOCKDEP too:
    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 5109 at kernel/sched/core.c:7404 __might_sleep+0x7d/0x90()

    usb: dwc3: Support Synopsys USB 3.1 IP
    
    commit 690fb3718a70c66004342f6f5e2e8a5f95b977db upstream.
    
    This patch allows the dwc3 driver to run on the new Synopsys USB 3.1
    IP core, albeit in USB 3.0 mode only.
    
    The Synopsys USB 3.1 IP (DWC_usb31) retains mostly the same register
    interface and programming model as the existing USB 3.0 controller IP
    (DWC_usb3). However the GSNPSID and version numbers are different.
    
    Add checking for the new ID to pass driver probe.
    
    Also, since the DWC_usb31 version number is lower in value than the
    full GSNPSID of the DWC_usb3 IP, we set the high bit to identify
    DWC_usb31 and to ensure the values are higher.
    
    Finally, add a documentation note about the revision numbering scheme.
    Any future revision checks (for STARS, workarounds, and new features)
    should take into consideration how it applies to both the 3.1/3.0 IP.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: let us set lower max_speed
    
    commit b9e51b2b1fda19143f48d182ed7a2943f21e1ae4 upstream.
    
    In some SoCs, dwc3 is implemented as a USB2.0 only
    core, meaning that it can't ever achieve SuperSpeed.
    
    Currect driver always sets gadget.max_speed to
    USB_SPEED_SUPER unconditionally. This can causes
    issues to some Host stacks where the host will issue
    a GetBOS() request and we will reply with a BOS
    containing Superspeed Capability Descriptor.
    
    At least Windows seems to be upset by this fact and
    prints a warning that we should connect $this device
    to another port.

    usb: gadget: atmel_usba_udc: Expose correct device speed
    
    commit d134c48d889ddceadf4c990e6f3df16b816ed5d4 upstream.
    
    Following changes that appeared in lk 4.0.0, the gadget udc driver for
    some ARM based Atmel SoCs (e.g. at91sam9x5 and sama5d3 families)
    incorrectly deduced full-speed USB link speed even when the hardware
    had negotiated a high-speed link. The fix is to make sure that the
    UDPHS Interrupt Enable Register value does not mask the SPEED bit
    in the Interrupt Status Register.
    
    For a mass storage gadget this problem lead to failures when the host
    had a USB 3 port with the xhci_hcd driver. If the host was a USB 2
    port using the ehci_hcd driver then the mass storage gadget worked
    (but probably at a lower speed than it should have).

    commit 5967c17b118a2bd1dd1d554cc4eee16233e52bec upstream.
    
    We should never allow to enable/disable any facilities for the guest

    kvm_arch_vcpu_(load|put) relies on SIMD not changing during runtime.
    If somebody would create and run VCPUs and then decides to enable
    SIMD, undefined behaviour could be possible (e.g. vector save area

    User space could pass an invalid emergency signal code (sending VCPU)
    and therefore exceed the bitmap. Let's take care of this case and
    check that the id is in the valid range.

    KVM: s390: fix wrong lookup of VCPUs by array index
    
    commit 152e9f65d66f0a3891efc3869440becc0e7ff53f upstream.
    
    For now, VCPUs were always created sequentially with incrementing
    VCPU ids. Therefore, the index in the VCPUs array matched the id.
    
    As sequential creation might change with cpu hotplug, let's use
    the correct lookup function to find a VCPU by id, not array index.
    
    Let's also use kvm_lookup_vcpu() for validation of the sending VCPU
    on external call injection.

    KVM: s390: SCA must not cross page boundaries
    
    commit c5c2c393468576bad6d10b2b5fefff8cd25df3f4 upstream.
    
    We seemed to have missed a few corner cases in commit f6c137ff00a4
    ("KVM: s390: randomize sca address").
    
    The SCA has a maximum size of 2112 bytes. By setting the sca_offset to
    some unlucky numbers, we exceed the page.
    
    0x7c0 (1984) -> Fits exactly
    0x7d0 (2000) -> 16 bytes out
    0x7e0 (2016) -> 32 bytes out
    0x7f0 (2032) -> 48 bytes out
    
    One VCPU entry is 32 bytes long.
    
    For the last two cases, we actually write data to the other page.
    1. The address of the VCPU.
    2. Injection/delivery/clearing of SIGP externall calls via SIGP IF.
    
    Especially the 2. happens regularly. So this could produce two problems:
    1. The guest losing/getting external calls.
    2. Random memory overwrites in the host.
    
    So this problem happens on every 127 + 128 created VM with 64 VCPUs.

    ath10k: fix invalid NSS for 4x4 devices
    
    commit f680f70adbeab28b35f849016b964dd645db6237 upstream.
    
    The number of spatial streams that are derived from chain mask
    for 4x4 devices is using wrong bitmask and conditional check.
    This is affecting downlink throughput for QCA99x0 devices. Earlier
    cfg_tx_chainmask is not filled by default until user configured it
    and so get_nss_from_chainmask never be called. This issue is exposed
    by recent commit 166de3f1895d ("ath10k: remove supported chain mask").
    By default maximum supported chain mask is filled in cfg_tx_chainmask.

    pinctrl: uniphier: set input-enable before pin-muxing
    
    commit bac7f4c1bf5e7c6ccd5bb71edc015b26c77f7460 upstream.
    
    While IECTRL is disabled, input signals are pulled-down internally.
    If pin-muxing is set up first, glitch signals (Low to High transition)
    might be input to hardware blocks.
    
    Bad case scenario:
    [1] The hardware block is already running before pinctrl is handled.
       (the reset is de-asserted by default or by a firmware, for example)
    [2] The pin-muxing is set up.  The input signals to hardware block
        are pulled-down by the chip-internal biasing.
    [3] The pins are input-enabled.  The signals from the board reach the
        hardware block.
    
    Actually, one invalid character is input to the UART blocks for such
    SoCs as PH1-LD4, PH1-sLD8, where UART devices start to run at the
    power on reset.
    
    To avoid such problems, pins should be input-enabled before muxing.

    arm64: page-align sections for DEBUG_RODATA
    
    commit cb083816ab5ac3d10a9417527f07fc5962cc3808 upstream.
    
    A kernel built with DEBUG_RO_DATA && !CONFIG_DEBUG_ALIGN_RODATA doesn't
    have .text aligned to a page boundary, though fixup_executable works at
    page-granularity thanks to its use of create_mapping. If .text is not
    page-aligned, the first page it exists in may be marked non-executable,
    leading to failures when an attempt is made to execute code in said
    page.
    
    This patch upgrades ALIGN_DEBUG_RO and ALIGN_DEBUG_RO_MIN to force page
    alignment for DEBUG_RO_DATA && !CONFIG_DEBUG_ALIGN_RODATA kernels,
    ensuring that all sections with specific RWX permission requirements are
    mapped with the correct permissions.

    can: sja1000: clear interrupts on start
    
    commit 7cecd9ab80f43972c056dc068338f7bcc407b71c upstream.
    
    According to SJA1000 data sheet error-warning (EI) interrupt is not
    cleared by setting the controller in to reset-mode.
    
    Then if we have the following case:
    - system is suspended (echo mem > /sys/power/state) and SJA1000 is left
      in operating state
    - A bus error condition occurs which activates EI interrupt, system is
      still suspended which means EI interrupt will be not be handled nor
      cleared.
    
    If the above two events occur, on resume there is no way to return the
    SJA1000 to operating state, except to cycle power to it.
    
    By simply reading the IR register on start we will clear any previous
    conditions that could be present.

    Bluetooth: Fix missing hdev locking for LE scan cleanup
    
    commit 8ce783dc5ea3af3a213ac9b4d9d2ccfeeb9c9058 upstream.
    
    The hci_conn objects don't have a dedicated lock themselves but rely
    on the caller to hold the hci_dev lock for most types of access. The
    hci_conn_timeout() function has so far sent certain HCI commands based
    on the hci_conn state which has been possible without holding the
    hci_dev lock.
    
    The recent changes to do LE scanning before connect attempts added
    even more operations to hci_conn and hci_dev from hci_conn_timeout,
    thereby exposing potential race conditions with the hci_dev and
    hci_conn states.
    
    As an example of such a race, here there's a timeout but an
    l2cap_sock_connect() call manages to race with the cleanup routine:

    [  +0.000003] hci_conn_hold: hcon f53d56e0 orig refcnt 0
    
    Above the l2cap_chan_connect() shouldn't have been able to reach the
    hci_conn f53d56e0 anymore but since hci_conn_timeout didn't do proper
    locking that's not the case. The end result is a reference to hci_conn
    that's not in the conn_hash list, resulting in list corruption when
    trying to remove it later:

    The necessary fix is unfortunately more complicated than just adding
    hci_dev_lock/unlock calls to the hci_conn_timeout() call path.
    Particularly, the hci_conn_del() API, which expects the hci_dev lock to
    be held, performs a cancel_delayed_work_sync(&hcon->disc_work) which
    would lead to a deadlock if the hci_conn_timeout() call path tries to
    acquire the same lock.
    
    This patch solves the problem by deferring the cleanup work to a
    separate work callback. To protect against the hci_dev or hci_conn
    going away meanwhile temporary references are taken with the help of
    hci_dev_hold() and hci_conn_get().

    Bluetooth: Fix removing connection parameters when unpairing
    
    commit a6ad2a6b9cc1d9d791aee5462cfb8528f366f1d4 upstream.
    
    The commit 89cbb0638e9b7 introduced support for deferred connection
    parameter removal when unpairing by removing them only once an
    existing connection gets disconnected. However, it failed to address
    the scenario when we're *not* connected and do an unpair operation.
    
    What makes things worse is that most user space BlueZ versions will
    first issue a disconnect request and only then unpair, meaning the
    buggy code will be triggered every time. This effectively causes the
    kernel to resume scanning and reconnect to a device for which we've
    removed all keys and GATT database information.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by adding the missing call to the
    hci_conn_params_del() function to a branch which handles the case of
    no existing connection.

    Bluetooth: hidp: fix device disconnect on idle timeout
    
    commit 660f0fc07d21114549c1862e67e78b1cf0c90c29 upstream.
    
    The HIDP specs define an idle-timeout which automatically disconnects a
    device. This has always been implemented in the HIDP layer and forced a
    synchronous shutdown of the hidp-scheduler. This works just fine, but
    lacks a forced disconnect on the underlying l2cap channels. This has been
    broken since:
    
        commit 5205185d461d5902325e457ca80bd421127b7308
        Author: David Herrmann <dh.herrmann@gmail.com>
        Date:   Sat Apr 6 20:28:47 2013 +0200
    
            Bluetooth: hidp: remove old session-management
    
    The old session-management always forced an l2cap error on the ctrl/intr
    channels when shutting down. The new session-management skips this, as we
    don't want to enforce channel policy on the caller. In other words, if
    user-space removes an HIDP device, the underlying channels (which are
    *owned* and *referenced* by user-space) are still left active. User-space
    needs to call shutdown(2) or close(2) to release them.
    
    Unfortunately, this does not work with idle-timeouts. There is no way to
    signal user-space that the HIDP layer has been stopped. The API simply
    does not support any event-passing except for poll(2). Hence, we restore
    old behavior and force EUNATCH on the sockets if the HIDP layer is
    disconnected due to idle-timeouts (behavior of explicit disconnects
    remains unmodified). User-space can still call
    
        getsockopt(..., SO_ERROR, ...)
    
    ..to retrieve the EUNATCH error and clear sk_err. Hence, the channels can
    still be re-used (which nobody does so far, though). Therefore, the API
    still supports the new behavior, but with this patch it's also compatible
    to the old implicit channel shutdown.

    mwifiex: fix mwifiex_rdeeprom_read()
    
    commit 1f9c6e1bc1ba5f8a10fcd6e99d170954d7c6d382 upstream.
    
    There were several bugs here.
    
    1)  The done label was in the wrong place so we didn't copy any
        information out when there was no command given.
    
    2)  We were using PAGE_SIZE as the size of the buffer instead of
        "PAGE_SIZE - pos".
    
    3)  snprintf() returns the number of characters that would have been
        printed if there were enough space.  If there was not enough space
        (and we had fixed the memory corruption bug #2) then it would result
        in an information leak when we do simple_read_from_buffer().  I've
        changed it to use scnprintf() instead.
    
    I also removed the initialization at the start of the function, because
    I thought it made the code a little more clear.

    Preallocated PCIe buffer is being reused for all PCIe interface
    events. Physical address of the buffer is shared with firmware
    so that it can perform DMA on it. As event length is specified
    in the header, there should not be a problem if the buffer gets
    overwritten.
    We will save some cycles by avoiding memset everytime while

    mfd: twl6040: Fix deferred probe handling for clk32k
    
    commit 75c08f17ec87c2d742487bb87408d6feebc526bd upstream.
    
    Commit 68bab8662f49 ("mfd: twl6040: Optional clk32k clock handling")
    added clock handling for the 32k clock from palmas-clk. However, that
    patch did not consider a typical situation where twl6040 is built-in,
    and palmas-clk is a loadable module like we have in omap2plus_defconfig.
    
    If palmas-clk is not loaded before twl6040 probes, we will get a
    "clk32k is not handled" warning during booting. This means that any
    drivers relying on this clock will mysteriously fail, including
    omap5-uevm WLAN and audio.
    
    Note that for WLAN, we probably should also eventually get
    the clk32kgaudio for MMC3 directly as that's shared between
    audio and WLAN SDIO at least for omap5-uevm. It seems the
    WLAN chip cannot get it as otherwise MMC3 won't get properly
    probed.

    fs/proc, core/debug: Don't expose absolute kernel addresses via wchan
    
    commit b2f73922d119686323f14fbbe46587f863852328 upstream.
    
    So the /proc/PID/stat 'wchan' field (the 30th field, which contains
    the absolute kernel address of the kernel function a task is blocked in)
    leaks absolute kernel addresses to unprivileged user-space:
    
            seq_put_decimal_ull(m, ' ', wchan);
    
    The absolute address might also leak via /proc/PID/wchan as well, if
    KALLSYMS is turned off or if the symbol lookup fails for some reason:
    
    static int proc_pid_wchan(struct seq_file *m, struct pid_namespace *ns,
                              struct pid *pid, struct task_struct *task)
    {
            unsigned long wchan;
            char symname[KSYM_NAME_LEN];
    
            wchan = get_wchan(task);
    
            if (lookup_symbol_name(wchan, symname) < 0) {
                    if (!ptrace_may_access(task, PTRACE_MODE_READ))
                            return 0;
                    seq_printf(m, "%lu", wchan);
            } else {
                    seq_printf(m, "%s", symname);
            }
    
            return 0;
    }
    
    This isn't ideal, because for example it trivially leaks the KASLR offset
    to any local attacker:
    
      fomalhaut:~> printf "%016lx\n" $(cat /proc/$$/stat | cut -d' ' -f35)
      ffffffff8123b380
    
    Most real-life uses of wchan are symbolic:
    
      ps -eo pid:10,tid:10,wchan:30,comm
    
    and procps uses /proc/PID/wchan, not the absolute address in /proc/PID/stat:
    
      triton:~/tip> strace -f ps -eo pid:10,tid:10,wchan:30,comm 2>&1 | grep wchan | tail -1
      open("/proc/30833/wchan", O_RDONLY)     = 6
    
    There's one compatibility quirk here: procps relies on whether the
    absolute value is non-zero - and we can provide that functionality
    by outputing "0" or "1" depending on whether the task is blocked
    (whether there's a wchan address).
    
    These days there appears to be very little legitimate reason
    user-space would be interested in  the absolute address. The
    absolute address is mostly historic: from the days when we
    didn't have kallsyms and user-space procps had to do the
    decoding itself via the System.map.
    
    So this patch sets all numeric output to "0" or "1" and keeps only
    symbolic output, in /proc/PID/wchan.
    
    ( The absolute sleep address can generally still be profiled via
      perf, by tasks with sufficient privileges. )

    commit 26c17a179f3f64f92de6e837c14279a6431a7ab6 upstream.
    
    In the actual RX processing, there is same error path for both descriptor
    ring refilling and building skb fails. This is not correct, because after
    successful refill, the ring is already updated with newly allocated
    buffer. Then, in case of build_skb() fail, hitherto code left the original
    buffer unmapped.
    
    This patch fixes above situation by swapping error check of skb build with
    DMA-unmap of original buffer.

    net: mvneta: Fix CPU_MAP registers initialisation
    
    commit 2502d0ef272da7058ef303b849a2c8dc324c2e2e upstream.
    
    The CPU_MAP register is duplicated for each CPUs at different addresses,
    each instance being at a different address.
    
    However, the code so far was using CONFIG_NR_CPUS to initialise the CPU_MAP
    registers for each registers, while the SoCs embed at most 4 CPUs.
    
    This is especially an issue with multi_v7_defconfig, where CONFIG_NR_CPUS

    commit d8cd37ed2fc871c66b4c79c59f651dc2cdf7091c upstream.
    
    When sending HCI data over NCI, HCI return code is part
    of the NCI data. In order to get correctly the HCI return
    code, we assume the NCI communication is successful and
    extract the return code for the nci_hci functions return code.

    x86/mpx: Fix 32-bit address space calculation
    
    commit f3119b830264d89d216bfb378ab65065dffa02d9 upstream.
    
    I received a bug report that running 32-bit MPX binaries on
    64-bit kernels was broken.  I traced it down to this little code
    snippet.  We were switching our "number of bounds directory
    entries" calculation correctly.  But, we didn't switch the other
    side of the calculation: the virtual space size.
    
    This meant that we were calculating an absurd size for
    bd_entry_virt_space() on 32-bit because we used the 64-bit
    virt_space.
    
    This was _also_ broken for 32-bit kernels running on 64-bit
    hardware since boot_cpu_data.x86_virt_bits=48 even when running
    in 32-bit mode.
    
    Correct that and properly handle all 3 possible cases:
    
     1. 32-bit binary on 64-bit kernel
     2. 64-bit binary on 64-bit kernel
     3. 32-bit binary on 32-bit kernel
    
    This manifested in having bounds tables not properly unmapped.
    It "leaked" memory but had no functional impact otherwise.

    x86/mpx: Do proper get_user() when running 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels
    
    commit 46561c3959d6307d22139c24cd0bf196162e5681 upstream.
    
    When you call get_user(foo, bar), you effectively do a
    
            copy_from_user(&foo, bar, sizeof(*bar));
    
    Note that the sizeof() is implicit.
    
    When we reach out to userspace to try to zap an entire "bounds
    table" we need to go read a "bounds directory entry" in order to
    locate the table's address.  The size of a "directory entry"
    depends on the binary being run and is always the size of a
    pointer.
    
    But, when we have a 64-bit kernel and a 32-bit application, the
    directory entry is still only 32-bits long, but we fetch it with
    a 64-bit pointer which makes get_user() does a 64-bit fetch.
    Reading 4 extra bytes isn't harmful, unless we are at the end of
    and run off the table.  It might also cause the zero page to get
    faulted in unnecessarily even if you are not at the end.
    
    Fix it up by doing a special 32-bit get_user() via a cast when
    we have 32-bit userspace.

    x86/fpu: Fix 32-bit signal frame handling
    
    commit ab6b52947545a5355154f64f449f97af9d05845f upstream.
    
    (This should have gone to LKML originally. Sorry for the extra
     noise, folks on the cc.)
    
    Background:
    
    Signal frames on x86 have two formats:
    
      1. For 32-bit executables (whether on a real 32-bit kernel or
         under 32-bit emulation on a 64-bit kernel) we have a
        'fpregset_t' that includes the "FSAVE" registers.
    
      2. For 64-bit executables (on 64-bit kernels obviously), the
         'fpregset_t' is smaller and does not contain the "FSAVE"
         state.
    
    When creating the signal frame, we have to be aware of whether
    we are running a 32 or 64-bit executable so we create the
    correct format signal frame.
    
    Problem:
    
    save_xstate_epilog() uses 'fx_sw_reserved_ia32' whenever it is
    called for a 32-bit executable.  This is for real 32-bit and
    ia32 emulation.
    
    But, fpu__init_prepare_fx_sw_frame() only initializes
    'fx_sw_reserved_ia32' when emulation is enabled, *NOT* for real
    32-bit kernels.
    
    This leads to really wierd situations where 32-bit programs
    lose their extended state when returning from a signal handler.
    The kernel copies the uninitialized (zero) 'fx_sw_reserved_ia32'
    out to userspace in save_xstate_epilog().  But when returning
    from the signal, the kernel errors out in check_for_xstate()
    when it does not see FP_XSTATE_MAGIC1 present (because it was
    zeroed).  This leads to the FPU/XSAVE state being initialized.
    
    For MPX, this leads to the most permissive state and means we
    silently lose bounds violations.  I think this would also mean
    that we could lose *ANY* FPU/SSE/AVX state.  I'm not sure why
    no one has spotted this bug.
    
    I believe this was broken by:
    
            72a671ced66d ("x86, fpu: Unify signal handling code paths for x86 and x86_64 kernels")

    x86/fpu: Fix get_xsave_addr() behavior under virtualization
    
    commit a05917b6ba9dc9a95fc42bdcbe3a875e8ad83935 upstream.
    
    KVM uses the get_xsave_addr() function in a different fashion from
    the native kernel, in that the 'xsave' parameter belongs to guest vcpu,
    not the currently running task.
    
    But 'xsave' is replaced with current task's (host) xsave structure, so
    get_xsave_addr() will incorrectly return the bad xsave address to KVM.
    
    Fix it so that the passed in 'xsave' address is used - as intended
    originally.

    x86/cpu: Fix SMAP check in PVOPS environments
    
    commit 581b7f158fe0383b492acd1ce3fb4e99d4e57808 upstream.
    
    There appears to be no formal statement of what pv_irq_ops.save_fl() is
    supposed to return precisely.  Native returns the full flags, while lguest and
    Xen only return the Interrupt Flag, and both have comments by the
    implementations stating that only the Interrupt Flag is looked at.  This may
    have been true when initially implemented, but no longer is.
    
    To make matters worse, the Xen PVOP leaves the upper bits undefined, making
    the BUG_ON() undefined behaviour.  Experimentally, this now trips for 32bit PV
    guests on Broadwell hardware.  The BUG_ON() is consistent for an individual
    build, but not consistent for all builds.  It has also been a sitting timebomb
    since SMAP support was introduced.
    
    Use native_save_fl() instead, which will obtain an accurate view of the AC
    flag.

    x86/cpu: Call verify_cpu() after having entered long mode too
    
    commit 04633df0c43d710e5f696b06539c100898678235 upstream.
    
    When we get loaded by a 64-bit bootloader, kernel entry point is
    startup_64 in head_64.S. We don't trust any and all bootloaders because
    some will fiddle with CPU configuration so we go ahead and massage each
    CPU into sanity again.
    
    For example, some dell BIOSes have this XD disable feature which set
    IA32_MISC_ENABLE[34] and disable NX. This might be some dumb workaround
    for other OSes but Linux sure doesn't need it.
    
    A similar thing is present in the Surface 3 firmware - see
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=106051 - which sets this bit
    only on the BSP:
    
      # rdmsr -a 0x1a0
      400850089
      850089
      850089
      850089
    
    I know, right?!
    
    There's not even an off switch in there.
    
    So fix all those cases by sanitizing the 64-bit entry point too. For
    that, make verify_cpu() callable in 64-bit mode also.

    x86/irq: Probe for PIC presence before allocating descs for legacy IRQs
    
    commit 8c058b0b9c34d8c8d7912880956543769323e2d8 upstream.
    
    Commit d32932d02e18 ("x86/irq: Convert IOAPIC to use hierarchical irqdomain
    interfaces") brought a regression for Hyper-V Gen2 instances. These
    instances don't have i8259 legacy PIC but they use legacy IRQs for serial
    port, rtc, and acpi. With this commit included we end up with these IRQs
    not initialized. Earlier, there was a special workaround for legacy IRQs
    in mp_map_pin_to_irq() doing mp_irqdomain_map() without looking at
    nr_legacy_irqs() and now we fail in __irq_domain_alloc_irqs() when
    irq_domain_alloc_descs() returns -EEXIST.
    
    The essence of the issue seems to be that early_irq_init() calls
    arch_probe_nr_irqs() to figure out the number of legacy IRQs before
    we probe for i8259 and gets 16. Later when init_8259A() is called we switch
    to NULL legacy PIC and nr_legacy_irqs() starts to return 0 but we already
    have 16 descs allocated.
    
    Solve the issue by separating i8259 probe from init and calling it in
    arch_probe_nr_irqs() before we actually use nr_legacy_irqs() information.

    x86/setup: Fix low identity map for >= 2GB kernel range
    
    commit 68accac392d859d24adcf1be3a90e41f978bd54c upstream.
    
    The commit f5f3497cad8c extended the low identity mapping. However, if
    the kernel uses more than 2 GB (VMSPLIT_2G_OPT or VMSPLIT_1G memory
    split), the normal memory mapping is overwritten by the low identity
    mapping causing a crash. To avoid overwritting, limit the low identity
    map to cover only memory before kernel range (PAGE_OFFSET).

    KVM: x86: work around infinite loop in microcode when #AC is delivered
    
    commit 54a20552e1eae07aa240fa370a0293e006b5faed upstream.
    
    It was found that a guest can DoS a host by triggering an infinite
    stream of "alignment check" (#AC) exceptions.  This causes the
    microcode to enter an infinite loop where the core never receives
    another interrupt.  The host kernel panics pretty quickly due to the
    effects (CVE-2015-5307).

    KVM: x86: obey KVM_X86_QUIRK_CD_NW_CLEARED in kvm_set_cr0()
    
    commit 879ae1880449c88db11c1ebdaedc2da79b2fe73f upstream.
    
    Commit b18d5431acc7 ("KVM: x86: fix CR0.CD virtualization") was
    technically correct, but it broke OVMF guests by slowing down various
    parts of the firmware.
    
    Commit fb279950ba02 ("KVM: vmx: obey KVM_QUIRK_CD_NW_CLEARED") quirked the
    first function modified by b18d5431acc7, vmx_get_mt_mask(), for OVMF's
    sake. This restored the speed of the OVMF code that runs before
    PlatformPei (including the memory intensive LZMA decompression in SEC).
    
    This patch extends the quirk to the second function modified by
    b18d5431acc7, kvm_set_cr0(). It eliminates the intrusive slowdown that
    hits the EFI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL implementation of edk2's
    UefiCpuPkg/CpuDxe -- which is built into OVMF --, when CpuDxe starts up
    all APs at once for initialization, in order to count them.
    
    We also carry over the kvm_arch_has_noncoherent_dma() sub-condition from
    the other half of the original commit b18d5431acc7.

    commit 89651a3decbe03754f304a0b248f27eeb9a37937 upstream.
    
    The SDM says that exiting system management mode from 64-bit mode
    is invalid, but that would be too good to be true.  But actually,
    most of the code is already there to support exiting from compat
    mode (EFER.LME=1, EFER.LMA=0).  Getting all the way from 64-bit
    mode to real mode only requires clearing CS.L and CR4.PCIDE.

    ARM: pxa: remove incorrect __init annotation on pxa27x_set_pwrmode
    
    commit 54c09889bff6d99c8733eed4a26c9391b177c88b upstream.
    
    The z2 machine calls pxa27x_set_pwrmode() in order to power off
    the machine, but this function gets discarded early at boot because
    it is marked __init, as pointed out by kbuild:
    
    WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x145c4): Section mismatch in reference from the function z2_power_off() to the function .init.text:pxa27x_set_pwrmode()
    The function z2_power_off() references
    the function __init pxa27x_set_pwrmode().
    This is often because z2_power_off lacks a __init
    annotation or the annotation of pxa27x_set_pwrmode is wrong.
    
    This removes the __init section modifier to fix rebooting and the
    build error.

    ARM: dts: Fix WLAN regression on omap5-uevm
    
    commit 0efc898a9bea7a2e8e583c6efab0e19dc7093078 upstream.
    
    Commit 99f84cae43df ("ARM: dts: add wl12xx/wl18xx bindings") added
    device tree bindings for the TI WLAN SDIO on many omap variants.
    
    I recall wondering how come omap5-uevm did not have the WLAN
    added and this issue has been bugging me for a while now, and
    I finally tracked it down to a bad pinmux regression, and a missing
    deferred probe handling for the 32k clock from palmas that's
    requested by twl6040.
    
    Basically 392adaf796b9 ("ARM: dts: omap5-evm: Add mcspi data")
    added pin muxing for mcspi4 that conflicts with the onboard
    WLAN. While some omap5-uevm don't have WLAN populated, the
    pins are not reused for other devices. And as the SDIO bus
    should be probed, let's try to enable WLAN by default.
    
    Let's fix the regression and add the WLAN configuration as
    done for the other boards in 99f84cae43df ("ARM: dts: add
    wl12xx/wl18xx bindings"). And let's use the new MMC pwrseq for
    the 32k clock as suggested by Javier Martinez Canillas
    <javier@dowhile0.org>.
    
    Note that without a related deferred probe fix for twl6040,
    the 32k clock is not initialized if palmas-clk is a module
    and twl6040 is built-in.
    
    Let's also use the generic "non-removable" instead of the
    legacy "ti,non-removable" property while at it.
    
    And finally, note that omap5 seems to require WAKEUP_EN for
    the WLAN GPIO interrupt.

    bonding: fix panic on non-ARPHRD_ETHER enslave failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 40baec225765c54eefa870530dd613bad9829bb7 ]
    
    Since commit 7d5cd2ce529b, when bond_enslave fails on devices that
    are not ARPHRD_ETHER, if needed, it resets the bonding device back to
    ARPHRD_ETHER by calling ether_setup.
    
            Unfortunately, ether_setup clobbers dev->flags, clearing IFF_UP
    if the bond device is up, leaving it in a quasi-down state without
    having actually gone through dev_close.  For bonding, if any periodic
    work queue items are active (miimon, arp_interval, etc), those will
    remain running, as they are stopped by bond_close.  At this point, if
    the bonding module is unloaded or the bond is deleted, the system will
    panic when the work function is called.
    
            This panic is resolved by calling dev_close on the bond itself
    prior to calling ether_setup.

    packet: race condition in packet_bind
    
    [ Upstream commit 30f7ea1c2b5f5fb7462c5ae44fe2e40cb2d6a474 ]
    
    There is a race conditions between packet_notifier and packet_bind{_spkt}.
    
    It happens if packet_notifier(NETDEV_UNREGISTER) executes between the
    time packet_bind{_spkt} takes a reference on the new netdevice and the
    time packet_do_bind sets po->ifindex.
    In this case the notification can be missed.
    If this happens during a dev_change_net_namespace this can result in the
    netdevice to be moved to the new namespace while the packet_sock in the
    old namespace still holds a reference on it. When the netdevice is later
    deleted in the new namespace the deletion hangs since the packet_sock
    is not found in the new namespace' &net->packet.sklist.
    It can be reproduced with the script below.
    
    This patch makes packet_do_bind check again for the presence of the
    netdevice in the packet_sock's namespace after the synchronize_net
    in unregister_prot_hook.
    More in general it also uses the rcu lock for the duration of the bind
    to stop dev_change_net_namespace/rollback_registered_many from
    going past the synchronize_net following unlist_netdevice, so that
    no NETDEV_UNREGISTER notifications can happen on the new netdevice
    while the bind is executing. In order to do this some code from
    packet_bind{_spkt} is consolidated into packet_do_dev.
    
    import socket, os, time, sys
    proto=7
    realDev='em1'
    vlanId=400
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
       vlanId=int(sys.argv[1])

              (realDev, dev, vlanId))
    os.system('ip netns add dummy')
    
    pid=os.fork()
    
    if pid == 0:
       # dev should be moved while packet_do_bind is in synchronize net

    sfc: push partner queue for skb->xmit_more
    
    [ Upstream commit b2663a4f30e85ec606b806f5135413e6d5c78d1e ]
    
    When the IP stack passes SKBs the sfc driver puts them in 2 different TX
    queues (called partners), one for checksummed and one for not checksummed.
    If the SKB has xmit_more set the driver will delay pushing the work to the
    NIC.
    
    When later it does decide to push the buffers this patch ensures it also
    pushes the partner queue, if that also has any delayed work. Before this
    fix the work in the partner queue would be left for a long time and cause
    a netdev watchdog.

    sit: fix sit0 percpu double allocations
    
    [ Upstream commit 4ece9009774596ee3df0acba65a324b7ea79387c ]
    
    sit0 device allocates its percpu storage twice :
    - One time in ipip6_tunnel_init()
    - One time in ipip6_fb_tunnel_init()
    
    Thus we leak 48 bytes per possible cpu per network namespace dismantle.
    
    ipip6_fb_tunnel_init() can be much simpler and does not
    return an error, and should be called after register_netdev()
    
    Note that ipip6_tunnel_clone_6rd() also needs to be called
    after register_netdev() (calling ipip6_tunnel_init())

    ipv4: update RTNH_F_LINKDOWN flag on UP event
    
    [ Upstream commit c9b3292eeb52c6834e972eb5b8fe38914771ed12 ]
    
    When nexthop is part of multipath route we should clear the
    LINKDOWN flag when link goes UP or when first address is added.
    This is needed because we always set LINKDOWN flag when DEAD flag
    was set but now on UP the nexthop is not dead anymore. Examples when
    LINKDOWN bit can be forgotten when no NETDEV_CHANGE is delivered:
    
    - link goes down (LINKDOWN is set), then link goes UP and device
    shows carrier OK but LINKDOWN remains set
    
    - last address is deleted (LINKDOWN is set), then address is
    added and device shows carrier OK but LINKDOWN remains set
    
    Steps to reproduce:
    modprobe dummy
    ifconfig dummy0 192.168.168.1 up
    
    here add a multipath route where one nexthop is for dummy0:
    
    ip route add 1.2.3.4 nexthop dummy0 nexthop SOME_OTHER_DEVICE
    ifconfig dummy0 down
    ifconfig dummy0 up
    
    now ip route shows nexthop that is not dead. Now set the sysctl var:
    
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/dummy0/ignore_routes_with_linkdown
    
    now ip route will show a dead nexthop because the forgotten
    RTNH_F_LINKDOWN is propagated as RTNH_F_DEAD.

    ipv4: fix to not remove local route on link down
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f823defdd5b106a5e89745ee8b163c71855de1e ]
    
    When fib_netdev_event calls fib_disable_ip on NETDEV_DOWN event
    we should not delete the local routes if the local address
    is still present. The confusion comes from the fact that both
    fib_netdev_event and fib_inetaddr_event use the NETDEV_DOWN
    constant. Fix it by returning back the variable 'force'.
    
    Steps to reproduce:
    modprobe dummy
    ifconfig dummy0 192.168.168.1 up
    ifconfig dummy0 down
    ip route list table local | grep dummy | grep host
    local 192.168.168.1 dev dummy0  proto kernel  scope host  src 192.168.168.1

    tipc: linearize arriving NAME_DISTR and LINK_PROTO buffers
    
    [ Upstream commit 5cbb28a4bf65c7e4daa6c25b651fed8eb888c620 ]
    
    Testing of the new UDP bearer has revealed that reception of
    NAME_DISTRIBUTOR, LINK_PROTOCOL/RESET and LINK_PROTOCOL/ACTIVATE
    message buffers is not prepared for the case that those may be
    non-linear.
    
    We now linearize all such buffers before they are delivered up to the
    generic reception layer.
    
    In order for the commit to apply cleanly to 'net' and 'stable', we do
    the change in the function tipc_udp_recv() for now. Later, we will post
    a commit to 'net-next' moving the linearization to generic code, in
    tipc_named_rcv() and tipc_link_proto_rcv().
