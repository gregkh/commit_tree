    efi: Make it possible to disable efivar_ssdt entirely
    
    commit 435d1a471598752446a72ad1201b3c980526d869 upstream.
    
    In most cases, such as CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT and
    CONFIG_ACPI_TABLE_UPGRADE, boot-time modifications to firmware tables
    are tied to specific Kconfig options.  Currently this is not the case
    for modifying the ACPI SSDT via the efivar_ssdt kernel command line
    option and associated EFI variable.
    
    This patch adds CONFIG_EFI_CUSTOM_SSDT_OVERLAYS, which defaults
    disabled, in order to allow enabling or disabling that feature during
    the build.

    irqchip/gic: Atomically update affinity
    
    commit 005c34ae4b44f085120d7f371121ec7ded677761 upstream.
    
    The GIC driver uses a RMW sequence to update the affinity, and
    relies on the gic_lock_irqsave/gic_unlock_irqrestore sequences
    to update it atomically.
    
    But these sequences only expand into anything meaningful if
    the BL_SWITCHER option is selected, which almost never happens.
    
    It also turns out that using a RMW and locks is just as silly,
    as the GIC distributor supports byte accesses for the GICD_TARGETRn
    registers, which when used make the update atomic by definition.
    
    Drop the terminally broken code and replace it by a byte write.

    MIPS: Add missing EHB in mtc0 -> mfc0 sequence for DSPen
    
    commit fcec538ef8cca0ad0b84432235dccd9059c8e6f8 upstream.
    
    This resolves the hazard between the mtc0 in the change_c0_status() and
    the mfc0 in configure_exception_vector(). Without resolving this hazard
    configure_exception_vector() could read an old value and would restore
    this old value again. This would revert the changes change_c0_status()
    did. I checked this by printing out the read_c0_status() at the end of
    per_cpu_trap_init() and the ST0_MX is not set without this patch.
    
    The hazard is documented in the MIPS Architecture Reference Manual Vol.
    III: MIPS32/microMIPS32 Privileged Resource Architecture (MD00088), rev
    6.03 table 8.1 which includes:
    
       Producer | Consumer | Hazard
      ----------|----------|----------------------------
       mtc0     | mfc0     | any coprocessor 0 register
    
    I saw this hazard on an Atheros AR9344 rev 2 SoC with a MIPS 74Kc CPU.
    There the change_c0_status() function would activate the DSPen by
    setting ST0_MX in the c0_status register. This was reverted and then the
    system got a DSP exception when the DSP registers were saved in
    save_dsp() in the first process switch. The crash looks like this:
    
    [    0.089999] Mount-cache hash table entries: 1024 (order: 0, 4096 bytes, linear)
    [    0.097796] Mountpoint-cache hash table entries: 1024 (order: 0, 4096 bytes, linear)
    [    0.107070] Kernel panic - not syncing: Unexpected DSP exception
    [    0.113470] Rebooting in 1 seconds..
    
    We saw this problem in OpenWrt only on the MIPS 74Kc based Atheros SoCs,
    not on the 24Kc based SoCs. We only saw it with kernel 5.4 not with
    kernel 4.19, in addition we had to use GCC 8.4 or 9.X, with GCC 8.3 it
    did not happen.
    
    In the kernel I bisected this problem to commit 9012d011660e ("compiler:
    allow all arches to enable CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING"), but when this was
    reverted it also happened after commit 172dcd935c34b ("MIPS: Always
    allocate exception vector for MIPSr2+").
    
    Commit 0b24cae4d535 ("MIPS: Add missing EHB in mtc0 -> mfc0 sequence.")
    does similar changes to a different file. I am not sure if there are
    more places affected by this problem.

    if the rename return -EACESS.
    
    In cifs_rename2, we unlink the positive target dentry if rename
    failed with EACESS or EEXIST, even if the target dentry is positived
    before rename. Then the existing file was deleted.
    
    We should just delete the target file which created during the

    nfsd: apply umask on fs without ACL support
    
    commit 22cf8419f1319ff87ec759d0ebdff4cbafaee832 upstream.
    
    The server is failing to apply the umask when creating new objects on
    filesystems without ACL support.
    
    To reproduce this, you need to use NFSv4.2 and a client and server
    recent enough to support umask, and you need to export a filesystem that
    lacks ACL support (for example, ext4 with the "noacl" mount option).
    
    Filesystems with ACL support are expected to take care of the umask
    themselves (usually by calling posix_acl_create).
    
    For filesystems without ACL support, this is up to the caller of
    vfs_create(), vfs_mknod(), or vfs_mkdir().

    i2c: algo-pca: Add 0x78 as SCL stuck low status for PCA9665
    
    [ Upstream commit cd217f2300793a106b49c7dfcbfb26e348bc7593 ]
    
    The PCA9665 datasheet says that I2CSTA = 78h indicates that SCL is stuck
    low, this differs to the PCA9564 which uses 90h for this indication.
    Treat either 0x78 or 0x90 as an indication that the SCL line is stuck.
    
    Based on looking through the PCA9564 and PCA9665 datasheets this should
    be safe for both chips. The PCA9564 should not return 0x78 for any valid
    state and the PCA9665 should not return 0x90.

    drm: sun4i: hdmi: Remove extra HPD polling
    
    [ Upstream commit bda8eaa6dee7525f4dac950810a85a88bf6c2ba0 ]
    
    The HPD sense mechanism in Allwinner's old HDMI encoder hardware is more
    or less an input-only GPIO. Other GPIO-based HPD implementations
    directly return the current state, instead of polling for a specific
    state and returning the other if that times out.
    
    Remove the I/O polling from sun4i_hdmi_connector_detect() and directly
    return a known state based on the current reading. This also gets rid
    of excessive CPU usage by kworker as reported on Stack Exchange [1] and
    Armbian forums [2].

    [ Upstream commit 016983d138cbe99a5c0aaae0103ee88f5300beb3 ]
    
    Per the datasheet for max6697, OVERT mask and ALERT mask are different.
    For example, the 7th bit of OVERT is the local channel but for alert
    mask, the 6th bit is the local channel. Therefore, we can't apply the
    same mask for both registers. In addition to that, the max6697 driver
    is supposed to be compatibale with different models. I manually went over
    all the listed chips and made sure all chip types have the same layout.
    
    Testing;
        mask value of 0x9 should map to 0x44 for ALERT and 0x84 for OVERT.
        I used iotool to read the reg value back to verify. I only tested this
        change on max6581.

    crypto: af_alg - fix use-after-free in af_alg_accept() due to bh_lock_sock()
    
    commit 34c86f4c4a7be3b3e35aa48bd18299d4c756064d upstream.
    
    The locking in af_alg_release_parent is broken as the BH socket
    lock can only be taken if there is a code-path to handle the case
    where the lock is owned by process-context.  Instead of adding
    such handling, we can fix this by changing the ref counts to
    atomic_t.
    
    This patch also modifies the main refcnt to include both normal
    and nokey sockets.  This way we don't have to fudge the nokey
    ref count when a socket changes from nokey to normal.

    kgdb: Avoid suspicious RCU usage warning
    
    [ Upstream commit 440ab9e10e2e6e5fd677473ee6f9e3af0f6904d6 ]
    
    At times when I'm using kgdb I see a splat on my console about
    suspicious RCU usage.  I managed to come up with a case that could
    reproduce this that looked like this:
    
      WARNING: suspicious RCU usage
      5.7.0-rc4+ #609 Not tainted
      -----------------------------
      kernel/pid.c:395 find_task_by_pid_ns() needs rcu_read_lock() protection!
    
      other info that might help us debug this:

    If I understand properly we should just be able to blanket kgdb under
    one big RCU read lock and the problem should go away.  We'll add it to
    the beast-of-a-function known as kgdb_cpu_enter().
    
    With this I no longer get any splats and things seem to work fine.

    mm/slub: fix stack overruns with SLUB_STATS
    
    [ Upstream commit a68ee0573991e90af2f1785db309206408bad3e5 ]
    
    There is no need to copy SLUB_STATS items from root memcg cache to new
    memcg cache copies.  Doing so could result in stack overruns because the
    store function only accepts 0 to clear the stat and returns an error for
    everything else while the show method would print out the whole stat.
    
    Then, the mismatch of the lengths returns from show and store methods
    happens in memcg_propagate_slab_attrs():
    
            else if (root_cache->max_attr_size < ARRAY_SIZE(mbuf))
                    buf = mbuf;
    
    max_attr_size is only 2 from slab_attr_store(), then, it uses mbuf[64]
    in show_stat() later where a bounch of sprintf() would overrun the stack
    variable.  Fix it by always allocating a page of buffer to be used in
    show_stat() if SLUB_STATS=y which should only be used for debug purpose.

    mm/slub.c: fix corrupted freechain in deactivate_slab()
    
    [ Upstream commit 52f23478081ae0dcdb95d1650ea1e7d52d586829 ]
    
    The slub_debug is able to fix the corrupted slab freelist/page.
    However, alloc_debug_processing() only checks the validity of current
    and next freepointer during allocation path.  As a result, once some
    objects have their freepointers corrupted, deactivate_slab() may lead to
    page fault.
    
    Below is from a test kernel module when 'slub_debug=PUF,kmalloc-128
    slub_nomerge'.  The test kernel corrupts the freepointer of one free
    object on purpose.  Unfortunately, deactivate_slab() does not detect it
    when iterating the freechain.
    
      BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 00000000123456f8
      #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode
      #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page
      PGD 0 P4D 0
      Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI
      ... ...
      RIP: 0010:deactivate_slab.isra.92+0xed/0x490
      ... ...
      Call Trace:

    Therefore, this patch adds extra consistency check in deactivate_slab().
    Once an object's freepointer is corrupted, all following objects
    starting at this object are isolated.

    allowed for __GFP_NORETRY and __GFP_NOWARN flags in most places, but
    missed swapin's "& GFP_KERNEL" mask for page tree node allocation in
    __read_swap_cache_async() - that was to mask off HIGHUSER_MOVABLE bits
    from what page cache uses, but GFP_RECLAIM_MASK is now what's needed.

    The -EINVAL error comes from the following chain of function calls:
    
      __btrfs_cow_block() <-- aborts the transaction
        btrfs_reloc_cow_block()
          replace_file_extents()
            get_new_location() <-- returns -EINVAL
    
    When relocating a data block group, for each allocated extent of the block
    group, we preallocate another extent (at prealloc_file_extent_cluster()),
    associated with the data relocation inode, and then dirty all its pages.
    These preallocated extents have, and must have, the same size that extents
    from the data block group being relocated have.
    
    Later before we start the relocation stage that updates pointers (bytenr
    field of file extent items) to point to the the new extents, we trigger
    writeback for the data relocation inode. The expectation is that writeback
    will write the pages to the previously preallocated extents, that it
    follows the NOCOW path. That is generally the case, however, if a scrub
    is running it may have turned the block group that contains those extents
    into RO mode, in which case writeback falls back to the COW path.
    
    However in the COW path instead of allocating exactly one extent with the
    expected size, the allocator may end up allocating several smaller extents
    due to free space fragmentation - because we tell it at cow_file_range()
    that the minimum allocation size can match the filesystem's sector size.
    This later breaks the relocation's expectation that an extent associated
    to a file extent item in the data relocation inode has the same size as
    the respective extent pointed by a file extent item in another tree - in
    this case the extent to which the relocation inode poins to is smaller,
    causing relocation.c:get_new_location() to return -EINVAL.
    
    For example, if we are relocating a data block group X that has a logical
    address of X and the block group has an extent allocated at the logical
    address X + 128KiB with a size of 64KiB:
    
    1) At prealloc_file_extent_cluster() we allocate an extent for the data
       relocation inode with a size of 64KiB and associate it to the file
       offset 128KiB (X + 128KiB - X) of the data relocation inode. This
       preallocated extent was allocated at block group Z;
    
    2) A scrub running in parallel turns block group Z into RO mode and
       starts scrubing its extents;
    
    3) Relocation triggers writeback for the data relocation inode;
    
    4) When running delalloc (btrfs_run_delalloc_range()), we try first the
       NOCOW path because the data relocation inode has BTRFS_INODE_PREALLOC
       set in its flags. However, because block group Z is in RO mode, the
       NOCOW path (run_delalloc_nocow()) falls back into the COW path, by
       calling cow_file_range();
    
    5) At cow_file_range(), in the first iteration of the while loop we call
       btrfs_reserve_extent() to allocate a 64KiB extent and pass it a minimum
       allocation size of 4KiB (fs_info->sectorsize). Due to free space
       fragmentation, btrfs_reserve_extent() ends up allocating two extents
       of 32KiB each, each one on a different iteration of that while loop;
    
    6) Writeback of the data relocation inode completes;
    
    7) Relocation proceeds and ends up at relocation.c:replace_file_extents(),
       with a leaf which has a file extent item that points to the data extent
       from block group X, that has a logical address (bytenr) of X + 128KiB
       and a size of 64KiB. Then it calls get_new_location(), which does a
       lookup in the data relocation tree for a file extent item starting at
       offset 128KiB (X + 128KiB - X) and belonging to the data relocation
       inode. It finds a corresponding file extent item, however that item
       points to an extent that has a size of 32KiB, which doesn't match the
       expected size of 64KiB, resuling in -EINVAL being returned from this
       function and propagated up to __btrfs_cow_block(), which aborts the
       current transaction.
    
    To fix this make sure that at cow_file_range() when we call the allocator
    we pass it a minimum allocation size corresponding the desired extent size
    if the inode belongs to the data relocation tree, otherwise pass it the
    filesystem's sector size as the minimum allocation size.

    btrfs: fix a block group ref counter leak after failure to remove block group
    
    [ Upstream commit 9fecd13202f520f3f25d5b1c313adb740fe19773 ]
    
    When removing a block group, if we fail to delete the block group's item
    from the extent tree, we jump to the 'out' label and end up decrementing
    the block group's reference count once only (by 1), resulting in a counter
    leak because the block group at that point was already removed from the
    block group cache rbtree - so we have to decrement the reference count
    twice, once for the rbtree and once for our lookup at the start of the
    function.
    
    There is a second bug where if removing the free space tree entries (the
    call to remove_block_group_free_space()) fails we end up jumping to the
    'out_put_group' label but end up decrementing the reference count only
    once, when we should have done it twice, since we have already removed
    the block group from the block group cache rbtree. This happens because
    the reference count decrement for the rbtree reference happens after
    attempting to remove the free space tree entries, which is far away from
    the place where we remove the block group from the rbtree.
    
    To make things less error prone, decrement the reference count for the
    rbtree immediately after removing the block group from it. This also
    eleminates the need for two different exit labels on error, renaming
    'out_put_label' to just 'out' and removing the old 'out'.
