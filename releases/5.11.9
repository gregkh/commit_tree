    cifs: Fix preauth hash corruption
    
    commit 05946d4b7a7349ae58bfa2d51ae832e64a394c2d upstream.
    
    smb311_update_preauth_hash() uses the shash in server->secmech without
    appropriate locking, and this can lead to sessions corrupting each
    other's preauth hashes.
    
    The following script can easily trigger the problem:
    
            #!/bin/sh -e
    
            NMOUNTS=10
            for i in $(seq $NMOUNTS);
                    mkdir -p /tmp/mnt$i
                    umount /tmp/mnt$i 2>/dev/null || :
            done
            while :; do
                    for i in $(seq $NMOUNTS); do
                            mount -t cifs //192.168.0.1/test /tmp/mnt$i -o ... &
                    done
                    wait
                    for i in $(seq $NMOUNTS); do
                            umount /tmp/mnt$i
                    done
            done
    
    Usually within seconds this leads to one or more of the mounts failing
    with the following errors, and a "Bad SMB2 signature for message" is
    seen in the server logs:
    
     CIFS: VFS: \\192.168.0.1 failed to connect to IPC (rc=-13)
     CIFS: VFS: cifs_mount failed w/return code = -13
    
    Fix it by holding the server mutex just like in the other places where
    the shashes are used.

    x86/apic/of: Fix CPU devicetree-node lookups
    
    commit dd926880da8dbbe409e709c1d3c1620729a94732 upstream.
    
    Architectures that describe the CPU topology in devicetree and do not have
    an identity mapping between physical and logical CPU ids must override the
    default implementation of arch_match_cpu_phys_id().
    
    Failing to do so breaks CPU devicetree-node lookups using of_get_cpu_node()
    and of_cpu_device_node_get() which several drivers rely on. It also causes
    the CPU struct devices exported through sysfs to point to the wrong
    devicetree nodes.
    
    On x86, CPUs are described in devicetree using their APIC ids and those
    do not generally coincide with the logical ids, even if CPU0 typically
    uses APIC id 0.
    
    Add the missing implementation of arch_match_cpu_phys_id() so that CPU-node
    lookups work also with SMP.
    
    Apart from fixing the broken sysfs devicetree-node links this likely does
    not affect current users of mainline kernels on x86.

    genirq: Disable interrupts for force threaded handlers
    
    commit 81e2073c175b887398e5bca6c004efa89983f58d upstream.
    
    With interrupt force threading all device interrupt handlers are invoked
    from kernel threads. Contrary to hard interrupt context the invocation only
    disables bottom halfs, but not interrupts. This was an oversight back then
    because any code like this will have an issue:
    
    thread(irq_A)
      irq_handler(A)
        spin_lock(&foo->lock);
    
    interrupt(irq_B)
      irq_handler(B)
        spin_lock(&foo->lock);
    
    This has been triggered with networking (NAPI vs. hrtimers) and console
    drivers where printk() happens from an interrupt which interrupted the
    force threaded handler.
    
    Now people noticed and started to change the spin_lock() in the handler to
    spin_lock_irqsave() which affects performance or add IRQF_NOTHREAD to the
    interrupt request which in turn breaks RT.
    
    Fix the root cause and not the symptom and disable interrupts before
    invoking the force threaded handler which preserves the regular semantics
    and the usefulness of the interrupt force threading as a general debugging
    tool.
    
    For not RT this is not changing much, except that during the execution of
    the threaded handler interrupts are delayed until the handler
    returns. Vs. scheduling and softirq processing there is no difference.
    
    For RT kernels there is no issue.

    efi: use 32-bit alignment for efi_guid_t literals
    
    commit fb98cc0b3af2ba4d87301dff2b381b12eee35d7d upstream.
    
    Commit 494c704f9af0 ("efi: Use 32-bit alignment for efi_guid_t") updated
    the type definition of efi_guid_t to ensure that it always appears
    sufficiently aligned (the UEFI spec is ambiguous about this, but given
    the fact that its EFI_GUID type is defined in terms of a struct carrying
    a uint32_t, the natural alignment is definitely >= 32 bits).
    
    However, we missed the EFI_GUID() macro which is used to instantiate
    efi_guid_t literals: that macro is still based on the guid_t type,
    which does not have a minimum alignment at all. This results in warnings
    such as
    
      In file included from drivers/firmware/efi/mokvar-table.c:35:
      include/linux/efi.h:1093:34: warning: passing 1-byte aligned argument to
          4-byte aligned parameter 2 of 'get_var' may result in an unaligned pointer
          access [-Walign-mismatch]
              status = get_var(L"SecureBoot", &EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID, NULL, &size,
                                              ^
      include/linux/efi.h:1101:24: warning: passing 1-byte aligned argument to
          4-byte aligned parameter 2 of 'get_var' may result in an unaligned pointer
          access [-Walign-mismatch]
              get_var(L"SetupMode", &EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID, NULL, &size, &setupmode);
    
    The distinction only matters on CPUs that do not support misaligned loads
    fully, but 32-bit ARM's load-multiple instructions fall into that category,
    and these are likely to be emitted by the compiler that built the firmware
    for loading word-aligned 128-bit GUIDs from memory
    
    So re-implement the initializer in terms of our own efi_guid_t type, so that
    the alignment becomes a property of the literal's type.

    ext4: fix rename whiteout with fast commit
    
    commit 8210bb29c1b66200cff7b25febcf6e39baf49fbf upstream.
    
    This patch adds rename whiteout support in fast commits. Note that the
    whiteout object that gets created is actually char device. Which
    imples, the function ext4_inode_journal_mode(struct inode *inode)
    would return "JOURNAL_DATA" for this inode. This has a consequence in
    fast commit code that it will make creation of the whiteout object a
    fast-commit ineligible behavior and thus will fall back to full
    commits. With this patch, this can be observed by running fast commits
    with rename whiteout and seeing the stats generated by ext4_fc_stats
    tracepoint as follows:
    
    ext4_fc_stats: dev 254:32 fc ineligible reasons:
    XATTR:0, CROSS_RENAME:0, JOURNAL_FLAG_CHANGE:0, NO_MEM:0, SWAP_BOOT:0,
    RESIZE:0, RENAME_DIR:0, FALLOC_RANGE:0, INODE_JOURNAL_DATA:16;
    num_commits:6, ineligible: 6, numblks: 3
    
    So in short, this patch guarantees that in case of rename whiteout, we
    fall back to full commits.
    
    Amir mentioned that instead of creating a new whiteout object for
    every rename, we can create a static whiteout object with irrelevant
    nlink. That will make fast commits to not fall back to full
    commit. But until this happens, this patch will ensure correctness by
    falling back to full commits.

    then we flush s_error_work. However s_error_work may report another fs
    error and re-arm timer thus resulting in timer use-after-free. Fix the
    problem by first flushing the work and only after that canceling the
    s_err_report timer.

    ext4: find old entry again if failed to rename whiteout
    
    commit b7ff91fd030dc9d72ed91b1aab36e445a003af4f upstream.
    
    If we failed to add new entry on rename whiteout, we cannot reset the
    old->de entry directly, because the old->de could have moved from under
    us during make indexed dir. So find the old entry again before reset is
    needed, otherwise it may corrupt the filesystem as below.
    
      /dev/sda: Entry '00000001' in ??? (12) has deleted/unused inode 15. CLEARED.
      /dev/sda: Unattached inode 75

    ext4: fix error handling in ext4_end_enable_verity()
    
    commit f053cf7aa66cd9d592b0fc967f4d887c2abff1b7 upstream.
    
    ext4 didn't properly clean up if verity failed to be enabled on a file:
    
    - It left verity metadata (pages past EOF) in the page cache, which
      would be exposed to userspace if the file was later extended.
    
    - It didn't truncate the verity metadata at all (either from cache or
      from disk) if an error occurred while setting the verity bit.
    
    Fix these bugs by adding a call to truncate_inode_pages() and ensuring
    that we truncate the verity metadata (both from cache and from disk) in
    all error paths.  Also rework the code to cleanly separate the success
    path from the error paths, which makes it much easier to understand.

    efivars: respect EFI_UNSUPPORTED return from firmware
    
    commit 483028edacab374060d93955382b4865a9e07cba upstream.
    
    As per UEFI spec 2.8B section 8.2, EFI_UNSUPPORTED may be returned by
    EFI variable runtime services if no variable storage is supported by
    firmware.  In this case, there is no point for kernel to continue
    efivars initialization.  That said, efivar_init() should fail by
    returning an error code, so that efivarfs will not be mounted on
    /sys/firmware/efi/efivars at all.  Otherwise, user space like efibootmgr
    will be confused by the EFIVARFS_MAGIC seen there, while EFI variable
    calls cannot be made successfully.

    x86: Introduce TS_COMPAT_RESTART to fix get_nr_restart_syscall()
    
    commit 8c150ba2fb5995c84a7a43848250d444a3329a7d upstream.
    
    The comment in get_nr_restart_syscall() says:
    
             * The problem is that we can get here when ptrace pokes
             * syscall-like values into regs even if we're not in a syscall
             * at all.
    
    Yes, but if not in a syscall then the
    
            status & (TS_COMPAT|TS_I386_REGS_POKED)
    
    check below can't really help:
    
            - TS_COMPAT can't be set
    
            - TS_I386_REGS_POKED is only set if regs->orig_ax was changed by
              32bit debugger; and even in this case get_nr_restart_syscall()
              is only correct if the tracee is 32bit too.
    
    Suppose that a 64bit debugger plays with a 32bit tracee and
    
            * Tracee calls sleep(2) // TS_COMPAT is set
            * User interrupts the tracee by CTRL-C after 1 sec and does
              "(gdb) call func()"
            * gdb saves the regs by PTRACE_GETREGS
            * does PTRACE_SETREGS to set %rip='func' and %orig_rax=-1
            * PTRACE_CONT           // TS_COMPAT is cleared
            * func() hits int3.
            * Debugger catches SIGTRAP.
            * Restore original regs by PTRACE_SETREGS.
            * PTRACE_CONT
    
    get_nr_restart_syscall() wrongly returns __NR_restart_syscall==219, the
    tracee calls ia32_sys_call_table[219] == sys_madvise.
    
    Add the sticky TS_COMPAT_RESTART flag which survives after return to user
    mode. It's going to be removed in the next step again by storing the
    information in the restart block. As a further cleanup it might be possible
    to remove also TS_I386_REGS_POKED with that.

    x86/ioapic: Ignore IRQ2 again
    
    commit a501b048a95b79e1e34f03cac3c87ff1e9f229ad upstream.
    
    Vitaly ran into an issue with hotplugging CPU0 on an Amazon instance where
    the matrix allocator claimed to be out of vectors. He analyzed it down to
    the point that IRQ2, the PIC cascade interrupt, which is supposed to be not
    ever routed to the IO/APIC ended up having an interrupt vector assigned
    which got moved during unplug of CPU0.
    
    The underlying issue is that IRQ2 for various reasons (see commit
    af174783b925 ("x86: I/O APIC: Never configure IRQ2" for details) is treated
    as a reserved system vector by the vector core code and is not accounted as
    a regular vector. The Amazon BIOS has an routing entry of pin2 to IRQ2
    which causes the IO/APIC setup to claim that interrupt which is granted by
    the vector domain because there is no sanity check. As a consequence the
    allocation counter of CPU0 underflows which causes a subsequent unplug to
    fail with:
    
      [ ... ] CPU 0 has 4294967295 vectors, 589 available. Cannot disable CPU
    
    There is another sanity check missing in the matrix allocator, but the
    underlying root cause is that the IO/APIC code lost the IRQ2 ignore logic
    during the conversion to irqdomains.
    
    For almost 6 years nobody complained about this wreckage, which might
    indicate that this requirement could be lifted, but for any system which
    actually has a PIC IRQ2 is unusable by design so any routing entry has no
    effect and the interrupt cannot be connected to a device anyway.
    
    Due to that and due to history biased paranoia reasons restore the IRQ2
    ignore logic and treat it as non existent despite a routing entry claiming
    otherwise.

    perf/x86/intel: Fix a crash caused by zero PEBS status
    
    commit d88d05a9e0b6d9356e97129d4ff9942d765f46ea upstream.
    
    A repeatable crash can be triggered by the perf_fuzzer on some Haswell
    system.
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/7170d3b-c17f-1ded-52aa-cc6d9ae999f4@maine.edu/
    
    For some old CPUs (HSW and earlier), the PEBS status in a PEBS record
    may be mistakenly set to 0. To minimize the impact of the defect, the
    commit was introduced to try to avoid dropping the PEBS record for some
    cases. It adds a check in the intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm(), and updates
    the local pebs_status accordingly. However, it doesn't correct the PEBS
    status in the PEBS record, which may trigger the crash, especially for
    the large PEBS.
    
    It's possible that all the PEBS records in a large PEBS have the PEBS
    status 0. If so, the first get_next_pebs_record_by_bit() in the
    __intel_pmu_pebs_event() returns NULL. The at = NULL. Since it's a large
    PEBS, the 'count' parameter must > 1. The second
    get_next_pebs_record_by_bit() will crash.
    
    Besides the local pebs_status, correct the PEBS status in the PEBS
    record as well.

    PCI: rpadlpar: Fix potential drc_name corruption in store functions
    
    commit cc7a0bb058b85ea03db87169c60c7cfdd5d34678 upstream.
    
    Both add_slot_store() and remove_slot_store() try to fix up the
    drc_name copied from the store buffer by placing a NUL terminator at
    nbyte + 1 or in place of a '\n' if present. However, the static buffer
    that we copy the drc_name data into is not zeroed and can contain
    anything past the n-th byte.
    
    This is problematic if a '\n' byte appears in that buffer after nbytes
    and the string copied into the store buffer was not NUL terminated to
    start with as the strchr() search for a '\n' byte will mark this
    incorrectly as the end of the drc_name string resulting in a drc_name
    string that contains garbage data after the n-th byte.
    
    Additionally it will cause us to overwrite that '\n' byte on the stack
    with NUL, potentially corrupting data on the stack.
    
    The following debugging shows an example of the drmgr utility writing
    "PHB 4543" to the add_slot sysfs attribute, but add_slot_store()
    logging a corrupted string value.
    
      drmgr: drmgr: -c phb -a -s PHB 4543 -d 1
      add_slot_store: drc_name = PHB 4543°|<82>!, rc = -19
    
    Fix this by using strscpy() instead of memcpy() to ensure the string
    is NUL terminated when copied into the static drc_name buffer.
    Further, since the string is now NUL terminated the code only needs to
    change '\n' to '\0' when present.

    counter: stm32-timer-cnt: fix ceiling miss-alignment with reload register
    
    commit b14d72ac731753708a7c1a6b3657b9312b6f0042 upstream.
    
    Ceiling value may be miss-aligned with what's actually configured into the
    ARR register. This is seen after probe as currently the ARR value is zero,
    whereas ceiling value is set to the maximum. So:
    - reading ceiling reports zero
    - in case the counter gets enabled without any prior configuration,
      it won't count.
    - in case the function gets set by the user 1st, (priv->ceiling) is used.
    
    Fix it by getting rid of the cached "priv->ceiling" variable. Rather use
    the ARR register value directly by using regmap read or write when needed.
    There should be no drawback on performance as priv->ceiling isn't used in
    performance critical path.
    There's also no point in writing ARR while setting function (sms), so
    it can be safely removed.

    counter: stm32-timer-cnt: fix ceiling write max value
    
    commit e4c3e133294c0a292d21073899b05ebf530169bd upstream.
    
    The ceiling value isn't checked before writing it into registers. The user

    Fixes a wrong bit mask used for the ADC's result, which was caused by an
    improper usage of the GENMASK() macro. The bits higher than ADC's
    resolution are undefined and if not masked out correctly, a wrong result
    can be given. The GENMASK() macro indexing is zero based, so the mask has
    to go from [resolution - 1 , 0].

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Prevent EP queuing while stopping transfers
    
    commit f09ddcfcb8c569675066337adac2ac205113471f upstream.
    
    In the situations where the DWC3 gadget stops active transfers, once
    calling the dwc3_gadget_giveback(), there is a chance where a function
    driver can queue a new USB request in between the time where the dwc3
    lock has been released and re-aquired.  This occurs after we've already
    issued an ENDXFER command.  When the stop active transfers continues
    to remove USB requests from all dep lists, the newly added request will
    also be removed, while controller still has an active TRB for it.
    This can lead to the controller accessing an unmapped memory address.
    
    Fix this by ensuring parameters to prevent EP queuing are set before
    calling the stop active transfers API.

    commit 77adb8bdf4227257e26b7ff67272678e66a0b250 upstream.
    
    The DWC3 runtime suspend routine checks for the USB connected parameter to
    determine if the controller can enter into a low power state.  The
    connected state is only set to false after receiving a disconnect event.
    However, in the case of a device initiated disconnect (i.e. UDC unbind),
    the controller is halted and a disconnect event is never generated.  Set
    the connected flag to false if issuing a device initiated disconnect to
    allow the controller to be suspended.

    usb-storage: Add quirk to defeat Kindle's automatic unload
    
    commit 546aa0e4ea6ed81b6c51baeebc4364542fa3f3a7 upstream.
    
    Matthias reports that the Amazon Kindle automatically removes its
    emulated media if it doesn't receive another SCSI command within about
    one second after a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE.  It does so even when the host
    has sent a PREVENT MEDIUM REMOVAL command.  The reason for this
    behavior isn't clear, although it's not hard to make some guesses.
    
    At any rate, the results can be unexpected for anyone who tries to
    access the Kindle in an unusual fashion, and in theory they can lead
    to data loss (for example, if one file is closed and synchronized
    while other files are still in the middle of being written).
    
    To avoid such problems, this patch creates a new usb-storage quirks
    flag telling the driver always to issue a REQUEST SENSE following a
    SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command, and adds an unusual_devs entry for the
    Kindle with the flag set.  This is sufficient to prevent the Kindle
    from doing its automatic unload, without interfering with proper
    operation.
    
    Another possible way to deal with this would be to increase the
    frequency of TEST UNIT READY polling that the kernel normally carries
    out for removable-media storage devices.  However that would increase
    the overall load on the system and it is not as reliable, because the
    user can override the polling interval.  Changing the driver's
    behavior is safer and has minimal overhead.

    powerpc: Force inlining of cpu_has_feature() to avoid build failure
    
    commit eed5fae00593ab9d261a0c1ffc1bdb786a87a55a upstream.
    
    The code relies on constant folding of cpu_has_feature() based
    on possible and always true values as defined per
    CPU_FTRS_ALWAYS and CPU_FTRS_POSSIBLE.
    
    Build failure is encountered with for instance
    book3e_all_defconfig on kisskb in the AMDGPU driver which uses
    cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTR_VSX_COMP) to decide whether calling
    kernel_enable_vsx() or not.
    
    The failure is due to cpu_has_feature() not being inlined with
    that configuration with gcc 4.9.
    
    In the same way as commit acdad8fb4a15 ("powerpc: Force inlining of
    mmu_has_feature to fix build failure"), for inlining of
    cpu_has_feature().

    [ Upstream commit c4c6df5fc84659690d4391d1fba155cd94185295 ]
    
    We only setup io queues for nvme controllers, and it makes absolutely no
    sense to allow a controller (re)connect without any I/O queues.  If we
    happen to fail setting the queue count for any reason, we should not allow
    this to be a successful reconnect as I/O has no chance in going through.
    Instead just fail and schedule another reconnect.

    There are two issues for RV32,
    1) if use FLATMEM, it is useless to enable SPARSEMEM_STATIC.
    2) if use SPARSMEM, both SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP and SPARSEMEM_STATIC is enabled.

    RISC-V: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in init_resources()
    
    commit ce989f1472ae350e844b10c880b22543168fbc92 upstream.
    
    init_resources() allocates an array of resources, based on the current
    total number of memory regions and reserved memory regions.  However,
    allocating this array using memblock_alloc() might increase the number
    of reserved memory regions.  If that happens, populating the array later
    based on the new number of regions will cause out-of-bounds writes
    beyond the end of the allocated array.
    
    Fix this by allocating one more entry, which may or may not be used.

    cifs: fix allocation size on newly created files
    
    commit 65af8f0166f4d15e61c63db498ec7981acdd897f upstream.
    
    Applications that create and extend and write to a file do not
    expect to see 0 allocation size.  When file is extended,
    set its allocation size to a plausible value until we have a
    chance to query the server for it.  When the file is cached
    this will prevent showing an impossible number of allocated
    blocks (like 0).  This fixes e.g. xfstests 614 which does
    
        1) create a file and set its size to 64K
        2) mmap write 64K to the file
        3) stat -c %b for the file (to query the number of allocated blocks)
    
    It was failing because we returned 0 blocks.  Even though we would
    return the correct cached file size, we returned an impossible
    allocation size.

    io_uring: ensure that SQPOLL thread is started for exit
    
    commit 3ebba796fa251d042be42b929a2d916ee5c34a49 upstream.
    
    If we create it in a disabled state because IORING_SETUP_R_DISABLED is
    set on ring creation, we need to ensure that we've kicked the thread if
    we're exiting before it's been explicitly disabled. Otherwise we can run
    into a deadlock where exit is waiting go park the SQPOLL thread, but the
    SQPOLL thread itself is waiting to get a signal to start.

    pstore: Fix warning in pstore_kill_sb()
    
    commit 9c7d83ae6ba67d6c6199cce24573983db3b56332 upstream.
    
    syzbot is hitting WARN_ON(pstore_sb != sb) at pstore_kill_sb() [1], for the
    assumption that pstore_sb != NULL is wrong because pstore_fill_super() will
    not assign pstore_sb = sb when new_inode() for d_make_root() returned NULL
    (due to memory allocation fault injection).
    
    Since mount_single() calls pstore_kill_sb() when pstore_fill_super()
    failed, pstore_kill_sb() needs to be aware of such failure path.

    iommu/tegra-smmu: Make tegra_smmu_probe_device() to handle all IOMMU phandles
    
    commit 8dfd0fa6ecdc5e2099a57d485b7ce237abc6c7a0 upstream.
    
    The tegra_smmu_probe_device() handles only the first IOMMU device-tree
    phandle, skipping the rest. Devices like 3D module on Tegra30 have
    multiple IOMMU phandles, one for each h/w block, and thus, only one
    IOMMU phandle is added to fwspec for the 3D module, breaking GPU.
    Previously this problem was masked by tegra_smmu_attach_dev() which
    didn't use the fwspec, but parsed the DT by itself. The previous commit
    to tegra-smmu driver partially reverted changes that caused problems for
    T124 and now we have tegra_smmu_attach_dev() that uses the fwspec and
    the old-buggy variant of tegra_smmu_probe_device() which skips secondary
    IOMMUs.
    
    Make tegra_smmu_probe_device() not to skip the secondary IOMMUs. This
    fixes a partially attached IOMMU of the 3D module on Tegra30 and now GPU
    works properly once again.

    i915/perf: Start hrtimer only if sampling the OA buffer
    
    commit 6a77c6bb7260bd5000f95df454d9f8cdb1af7132 upstream.
    
    SAMPLE_OA parameter enables sampling of OA buffer and results in a call
    to init the OA buffer which initializes the OA unit head/tail pointers.
    The OA_EXPONENT parameter controls the periodicity of the OA reports in
    the OA buffer and results in starting a hrtimer.
    
    Before gen12, all use cases required the use of the OA buffer and i915
    enforced this setting when vetting out the parameters passed. In these
    platforms the hrtimer was enabled if OA_EXPONENT was passed. This worked
    fine since it was implied that SAMPLE_OA is always passed.
    
    With gen12, this changed. Users can use perf without enabling the OA
    buffer as in OAR use cases. While an OAR use case should ideally not
    start the hrtimer, we see that passing an OA_EXPONENT parameter will
    start the hrtimer even though SAMPLE_OA is not specified. This results
    in an uninitialized OA buffer, so the head/tail pointers used to track
    the buffer are zero.
    
    This itself does not fail, but if we ran a use-case that SAMPLED the OA
    buffer previously, then the OA_TAIL register is still pointing to an old
    value. When the timer callback runs, it ends up calculating a
    wrong/large number of available reports. Since we do a spinlock_irq_save
    and start processing a large number of reports, NMI watchdog fires and
    causes a crash.
    
    Start the timer only if SAMPLE_OA is specified.
    
    v2:
    - Drop SAMPLE OA check when appending samples (Ashutosh)
    - Prevent read if OA buffer is not being sampled

    sunrpc: fix refcount leak for rpc auth modules
    
    commit f1442d6349a2e7bb7a6134791bdc26cb776c79af upstream.
    
    If an auth module's accept op returns SVC_CLOSE, svc_process_common()
    enters a call path that does not call svc_authorise() before leaving the
    function, and thus leaks a reference on the auth module's refcount. Hence,
    make sure calls to svc_authenticate() and svc_authorise() are paired for
    all call paths, to make sure rpc auth modules can be unloaded.

    vhost_vdpa: fix the missing irq_bypass_unregister_producer() invocation
    
    commit 4c050286bb202cffd5467c1cba982dff391d62e1 upstream.
    
    When qemu with vhost-vdpa netdevice is run for the first time,
    it works well. But after the VM is powered off, the next qemu run
    causes kernel panic due to a NULL pointer dereference in
    irq_bypass_register_producer().
    
    When the VM is powered off, vhost_vdpa_clean_irq() misses on calling
    irq_bypass_unregister_producer() for irq 0 because of the existing check.
    
    This leaves stale producer nodes, which are reset in
    vhost_vring_call_reset() when vhost_dev_init() is invoked during the
    second qemu run.
    
    As the node member of struct irq_bypass_producer is also initialized
    to zero, traversal on the producers list causes crash due to NULL
    pointer dereference.

    vfio: IOMMU_API should be selected
    
    commit 179209fa12709a3df8888c323b37315da2683c24 upstream.
    
    As IOMMU_API is a kconfig without a description (eg does not show in the
    menu) the correct operator is select not 'depends on'. Using 'depends on'
    for this kind of symbol means VFIO is not selectable unless some other
    random kconfig has already enabled IOMMU_API for it.

    This brings it in line with the regular tcp backchannel, which also has

    NFSD: Repair misuse of sv_lock in 5.10.16-rt30.
    
    commit c7de87ff9dac5f396f62d584f3908f80ddc0e07b upstream.
    
    [ This problem is in mainline, but only rt has the chops to be
    able to detect it. ]
    
    Lockdep reports a circular lock dependency between serv->sv_lock and
    softirq_ctl.lock on system shutdown, when using a kernel built with
    CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT=y, and a nfs mount exists.
    
    This is due to the definition of spin_lock_bh on rt:
    
            local_bh_disable();
            rt_spin_lock(lock);
    
    which forces a softirq_ctl.lock -> serv->sv_lock dependency.  This is
    not a problem as long as _every_ lock of serv->sv_lock is a:
    
            spin_lock_bh(&serv->sv_lock);
    
    but there is one of the form:
    
            spin_lock(&serv->sv_lock);
    
    This is what is causing the circular dependency splat.  The spin_lock()
    grabs the lock without first grabbing softirq_ctl.lock via local_bh_disable.
    If later on in the critical region,  someone does a local_bh_disable, we
    get a serv->sv_lock -> softirq_ctrl.lock dependency established.  Deadlock.
    
    Fix is to make serv->sv_lock be locked with spin_lock_bh everywhere, no
    exceptions.

    commit bfdd89f232aa2de5a4b3fc985cba894148b830a8 upstream.
    
    The typical result of the backwards comparison here is that the source
    server in a server-to-server copy will return BAD_STATEID within a few
    seconds of the copy starting, instead of giving the copy a full lease
    period, so the copy_file_range() call will end up unnecessarily
    returning a short read.

    We only setup io queues for nvme controllers, and it makes absolutely no
    sense to allow a controller (re)connect without any I/O queues.  If we
    happen to fail setting the queue count for any reason, we should not
    allow this to be a successful reconnect as I/O has no chance in going
    through. Instead just fail and schedule another reconnect.

    The shifting of the u8 integer device by 24 bits to the left will
    be promoted to a 32 bit signed int and then sign-extended to a
    64 bit unsigned long. In the event that the top bit of device is
    set then all then all the upper 32 bits of the unsigned long will

    afs: Stop listxattr() from listing "afs.*" attributes
    
    commit a7889c6320b9200e3fe415238f546db677310fa9 upstream.
    
    afs_listxattr() lists all the available special afs xattrs (i.e. those in
    the "afs.*" space), no matter what type of server we're dealing with.  But
    OpenAFS servers, for example, cannot deal with some of the extra-capable
    attributes that AuriStor (YFS) servers provide.  Unfortunately, the
    presence of the afs.yfs.* attributes causes errors[1] for anything that
    tries to read them if the server is of the wrong type.
    
    Fix the problem by removing afs_listxattr() so that none of the special
    xattrs are listed (AFS doesn't support xattrs).  It does mean, however,
    that getfattr won't list them, though they can still be accessed with
    getxattr() and setxattr().
    
    This can be tested with something like:
    
            getfattr -d -m ".*" /afs/example.com/path/to/file
    
    With this change, none of the afs.* attributes should be visible.
    
    Changes:
    ver #2:
     - Hide all of the afs.* xattrs, not just the ACL ones.

    afs: Fix accessing YFS xattrs on a non-YFS server
    
    commit 64fcbb6158ecc684d84c64424830a9c37c77c5b9 upstream.
    
    If someone attempts to access YFS-related xattrs (e.g. afs.yfs.acl) on a
    file on a non-YFS AFS server (such as OpenAFS), then the kernel will jump
    to a NULL function pointer because the afs_fetch_acl_operation descriptor
    doesn't point to a function for issuing an operation on a non-YFS
    server[1].
    
    Fix this by making afs_wait_for_operation() check that the issue_afs_rpc
    method is set before jumping to it and setting -ENOTSUPP if not.  This fix
    also covers other potential operations that also only exist on YFS servers.
    
    afs_xattr_get/set_yfs() then need to translate -ENOTSUPP to -ENODATA as the
    former error is internal to the kernel.
    
    The bug shows up as an oops like the following:
    
            BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
            [...]

    This was triggered with "cp -a" which attempts to copy xattrs, including
    afs ones, but is easier to reproduce with getfattr, e.g.:
    
            getfattr -d -m ".*" /afs/openafs.org/

    commit 8ca88d53351cc58d535b2bfc7386835378fb0db2 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 1e30f642cf29 ("ASoC: simple-card-utils: Fix device
    module clock"). The original patch ended up breaking following platform,
    which depends on set_sysclk() to configure internal PLL on wm8904 codec
    and expects simple-card-utils to not update the MCLK rate.
     - "arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/fsl-ls1028a-kontron-sl28-var3-ads2.dts"
    
    It would be best if codec takes care of setting MCLK clock via DAI
    set_sysclk() callback.

    commit ca08ddfd961d2a17208d9182e0ee5791b39bd8bf upstream.
    
    When I added the quirk for the "HP Pavilion x2 10-p0XX" I copied the
    byt_rt5640_quirk_table[] entry for the HP Pavilion x2 10-k0XX / 10-n0XX
    models since these use almost the same settings.
    
    While doing this I accidentally also copied and kept the non-standard
    OVCD_TH_1500UA setting used on those models. This too low threshold is
    causing headsets to often be seen as headphones (without a headset-mic)
    and when correctly identified it is causing ghost play/pause
    button-presses to get detected.
    
    Correct the HP Pavilion x2 10-p0XX quirk to use the default OVCD_TH_2000UA
    setting, fixing these problems.

    drm/amd/display: Correct algorithm for reversed gamma
    
    commit 34fa493a565cc6fcee6919787c11e264f55603c6 upstream.
    
    [Why]
    DCN30 needs to correctly program reversed gamma curve, which DCN20
    already has.
    Also needs to fix a bug that 252-255 values are clipped.
    
    [How]
    Apply two fixes into DCN30.

    drm/amd/display: Copy over soc values before bounding box creation
    
    commit 73076790e25717b7d452c2eab0bfb118826e5b61 upstream.
    
    [Why]
    With certain fclock overclocks, state 1 may be chosen
    as the closest clock level. This may result in this state
    being empty if not populated beforehand, resulting in
    black screens and screen corruption.
    
    [How]
    Copy over all soc states to clock_limits before bounding
    box creation to avoid any cases with empty states.

    vhost-vdpa: set v->config_ctx to NULL if eventfd_ctx_fdget() fails
    
    commit 0bde59c1723a29e294765c96dbe5c7fb639c2f96 upstream.
    
    In vhost_vdpa_set_config_call() if eventfd_ctx_fdget() fails the
    'v->config_ctx' contains an error instead of a valid pointer.
    
    Since we consider 'v->config_ctx' valid if it is not NULL, we should
    set it to NULL in this case to avoid to use an invalid pointer in
    other functions such as vhost_vdpa_config_put().

    vhost-vdpa: fix use-after-free of v->config_ctx
    
    commit f6bbf0010ba004f5e90c7aefdebc0ee4bd3283b9 upstream.
    
    When the 'v->config_ctx' eventfd_ctx reference is released we didn't
    set it to NULL. So if the same character device (e.g. /dev/vhost-vdpa-0)
    is re-opened, the 'v->config_ctx' is invalid and calling again
    vhost_vdpa_config_put() causes use-after-free issues like the
    following refcount_t underflow:
    
        refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.

      1214                            btrfs_set_node_key(eb, &tm->key, tm->slot);
    
    Here's what happens to hit that BUG_ON():
    
    1) We have one tree mod log user (through fiemap or the logical ino ioctl),
       with a sequence number of 1, so we have fs_info->tree_mod_seq == 1;
    
    2) Another task is at ctree.c:balance_level() and we have eb X currently as
       the root of the tree, and we promote its single child, eb Y, as the new
       root.
    
       Then, at ctree.c:balance_level(), we call:
    
          tree_mod_log_insert_root(eb X, eb Y, 1);
    
    3) At tree_mod_log_insert_root() we create tree mod log elements for each
       slot of eb X, of operation type MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING each
       with a ->logical pointing to ebX->start. These are placed in an array
       named tm_list.
       Lets assume there are N elements (N pointers in eb X);
    
    4) Then, still at tree_mod_log_insert_root(), we create a tree mod log
       element of operation type MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE, ->logical set to
       ebY->start, ->old_root.logical set to ebX->start, ->old_root.level set
       to the level of eb X and ->generation set to the generation of eb X;
    
    5) Then tree_mod_log_insert_root() calls tree_mod_log_free_eb() with
       tm_list as argument. After that, tree_mod_log_free_eb() calls
       __tree_mod_log_insert() for each member of tm_list in reverse order,
       from highest slot in eb X, slot N - 1, to slot 0 of eb X;
    
    6) __tree_mod_log_insert() sets the sequence number of each given tree mod
       log operation - it increments fs_info->tree_mod_seq and sets
       fs_info->tree_mod_seq as the sequence number of the given tree mod log
       operation.
    
       This means that for the tm_list created at tree_mod_log_insert_root(),
       the element corresponding to slot 0 of eb X has the highest sequence
       number (1 + N), and the element corresponding to the last slot has the
       lowest sequence number (2);
    
    7) Then, after inserting tm_list's elements into the tree mod log rbtree,
       the MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE element is inserted, which gets the highest
       sequence number, which is N + 2;
    
    8) Back to ctree.c:balance_level(), we free eb X by calling
       btrfs_free_tree_block() on it. Because eb X was created in the current
       transaction, has no other references and writeback did not happen for
       it, we add it back to the free space cache/tree;
    
    9) Later some other task T allocates the metadata extent from eb X, since
       it is marked as free space in the space cache/tree, and uses it as a
       node for some other btree;
    
    10) The tree mod log user task calls btrfs_search_old_slot(), which calls
        get_old_root(), and finally that calls __tree_mod_log_oldest_root()
        with time_seq == 1 and eb_root == eb Y;
    
    11) First iteration of the while loop finds the tree mod log element with
        sequence number N + 2, for the logical address of eb Y and of type
        MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE;
    
    12) Because the operation type is MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE, we don't break out
        of the loop, and set root_logical to point to tm->old_root.logical
        which corresponds to the logical address of eb X;
    
    13) On the next iteration of the while loop, the call to
        tree_mod_log_search_oldest() returns the smallest tree mod log element
        for the logical address of eb X, which has a sequence number of 2, an
        operation type of MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING and corresponds to
        the old slot N - 1 of eb X (eb X had N items in it before being freed);
    
    14) We then break out of the while loop and return the tree mod log operation
        of type MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE (eb Y), and not the one for slot N - 1 of
        eb X, to get_old_root();
    
    15) At get_old_root(), we process the MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE operation
        and set "logical" to the logical address of eb X, which was the old
        root. We then call tree_mod_log_search() passing it the logical
        address of eb X and time_seq == 1;
    
    16) Then before calling tree_mod_log_search(), task T adds a key to eb X,
        which results in adding a tree mod log operation of type
        MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD to the tree mod log - this is done at
        ctree.c:insert_ptr() - but after adding the tree mod log operation
        and before updating the number of items in eb X from 0 to 1...
    
    17) The task at get_old_root() calls tree_mod_log_search() and gets the
        tree mod log operation of type MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD just added by task T.
        Then it enters the following if branch:
    
        if (old_root && tm && tm->op != MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING) {
           (...)
        } (...)
    
        Calls read_tree_block() for eb X, which gets a reference on eb X but
        does not lock it - task T has it locked.
        Then it clones eb X while it has nritems set to 0 in its header, before
        task T sets nritems to 1 in eb X's header. From hereupon we use the
        clone of eb X which no other task has access to;
    
    18) Then we call __tree_mod_log_rewind(), passing it the MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD
        mod log operation we just got from tree_mod_log_search() in the
        previous step and the cloned version of eb X;
    
    19) At __tree_mod_log_rewind(), we set the local variable "n" to the number
        of items set in eb X's clone, which is 0. Then we enter the while loop,
        and in its first iteration we process the MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD operation,
        which just decrements "n" from 0 to (u32)-1, since "n" is declared with
        a type of u32. At the end of this iteration we call rb_next() to find the
        next tree mod log operation for eb X, that gives us the mod log operation
        of type MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING, for slot 0, with a sequence
        number of N + 1 (steps 3 to 6);
    
    20) Then we go back to the top of the while loop and trigger the following
        BUG_ON():
    
            (...)
            switch (tm->op) {
            case MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING:
                     BUG_ON(tm->slot < n);
                     fallthrough;
            (...)
    
        Because "n" has a value of (u32)-1 (4294967295) and tm->slot is 0.
    
    Fix this by taking a read lock on the extent buffer before cloning it at
    ctree.c:get_old_root(). This should be done regardless of the extent
    buffer having been freed and reused, as a concurrent task might be
    modifying it (while holding a write lock on it).

    zonefs: Fix O_APPEND async write handling
    
    commit ebfd68cd0c1e81267c757332385cb96df30dacce upstream.
    
    zonefs updates the size of a sequential zone file inode only on
    completion of direct writes. When executing asynchronous append writes
    (with a file open with O_APPEND or using RWF_APPEND), the use of the
    current inode size in generic_write_checks() to set an iocb offset thus
    leads to unaligned write if an application issues an append write
    operation with another write already being executed.
    
    Fix this problem by introducing zonefs_write_checks() as a modified
    version of generic_write_checks() using the file inode wp_offset for an
    append write iocb offset. Also introduce zonefs_write_check_limits() to
    replace generic_write_check_limits() call. This zonefs special helper
    makes sure that the maximum file limit used is the maximum size of the
    file being accessed.
    
    Since zonefs_write_checks() already truncates the iov_iter, the calls
    to iov_iter_truncate() in zonefs_file_dio_write() and
    zonefs_file_buffered_write() are removed.

    s390/pci: fix leak of PCI device structure
    
    commit 0b13525c20febcfecccf6fc1db5969727401317d upstream.
    
    In commit 05bc1be6db4b2 ("s390/pci: create zPCI bus") we removed the
    pci_dev_put() call matching the earlier pci_get_slot() done as part of
    __zpci_event_availability(). This was based on the wrong understanding
    that the device_put() done as part of pci_destroy_device() would counter
    the pci_get_slot() when it only counters the initial reference. This
    same understanding and existing bad example also lead to not doing
    a pci_dev_put() in zpci_remove_device().
    
    Since releasing the PCI devices, unlike releasing the PCI slot, does not
    print any debug message for testing I added one in pci_release_dev().
    This revealed that we are indeed leaking the PCI device on PCI
    hotunplug. Further testing also revealed another missing pci_dev_put() in
    disable_slot().
    
    Fix this by adding the missing pci_dev_put() in disable_slot() and fix
    zpci_remove_device() with the correct pci_dev_put() calls. Also instead
    of calling pci_get_slot() in __zpci_event_availability() to determine if
    a PCI device is registered and then doing the same again in
    zpci_remove_device() do this once in zpci_remove_device() which makes
    sure that the pdev in __zpci_event_availability() is only used for the
    result of pci_scan_single_device() which does not need a reference count
    decremnt as its ownership goes to the PCI bus.
    
    Also move the check if zdev->zbus->bus is set into zpci_remove_device()
    since it may be that we're removing a device with devfn != 0 which never
    had a PCI bus. So we can still set the pdev->error_state to indicate
    that the device is not usable anymore, add a flag to set the error state.

    s390/pci: remove superfluous zdev->zbus check
    
    commit e1bff843cde62a45a287b7f9b4cd5e824e8e49e2 upstream.
    
    Checking zdev->zbus for NULL in __zpci_event_availability() is
    superfluous as it can never be NULL at this point. While harmless this
    check causes smatch warnings because we later access zdev->zbus with
    only having checked zdev != NULL which is sufficient.
    
    The reason zdev->zbus can never be NULL is since with zdev != NULL given
    we know the zdev came from get_zdev_by_fid() and thus the zpci_list.
    Now on first glance at zpci_create_device() one may assume that there is
    a window where the zdev is in the list without a zdev, however this
    window can't overlap with __zpci_event_availability() as
    zpci_create_device() either runs on the same kthread as part of
    availability events, or during the initial CLP List PCI at which point
    the __zpci_event_availability() is not yet called as zPCI is not yet
    initialized.

    s390/pci: refactor zpci_create_device()
    
    commit ba764dd703feacb5a9c410d191af1b6cfbe96845 upstream.
    
    Currently zpci_create_device() is only called in clp_add_pci_device()
    which allocates the memory for the struct zpci_dev being created. There
    is little separation of concerns as only both functions together can
    create a zpci_dev and the only CLP specific code in
    clp_add_pci_device() is a call to clp_query_pci_fn().
    
    Improve this by removing clp_add_pci_device() and refactor
    zpci_create_device() such that it alone creates and initializes the
    zpci_dev given the FID and Function Handle. For this we need to make
    clp_query_pci_fn() non-static. While at it remove the function handle
    parameter since we can just take that from the zpci_dev. Also move
    adding to the zpci_list to after the zdev has been fully created which
    eliminates a window where a partially initialized zdev can be found by
    get_zdev_by_fid().

    ALSA: hda: generic: Fix the micmute led init state
    
    commit 2bf44e0ee95f39cc54ea1b942f0a027e0181ca4e upstream.
    
    Recently we found the micmute led init state is not correct after
    freshly installing the ubuntu linux on a Lenovo AIO machine. The
    internal mic is not muted, but the micmute led is on and led mode is
    'follow mute'. If we mute internal mic, the led is keeping on, then
    unmute the internal mic, the led is off. And from then on, the
    micmute led will work correctly.
    
    So the micmute led init state is not correct. The led is controlled
    by codec gpio (ALC233_FIXUP_LENOVO_LINE2_MIC_HOTKEY), in the
    patch_realtek, the gpio data is set to 0x4 initially and the led is
    on with this data. In the hda_generic, the led_value is set to
    0 initially, suppose users set the 'capture switch' to on from
    user space and the micmute led should change to be off with this
    operation, but the check "if (val == spec->micmute_led.led_value)" in
    the call_micmute_led_update() will skip the led setting.
    
    To guarantee the led state will be set by the 1st time of changing
    "Capture Switch", set -1 to the init led_value.

    ALSA: dice: fix null pointer dereference when node is disconnected
    
    commit dd7b836d6bc935df95c826f69ff4d051f5561604 upstream.
    
    When node is removed from IEEE 1394 bus, any transaction fails to the node.
    In the case, ALSA dice driver doesn't stop isochronous contexts even if
    they are running. As a result, null pointer dereference occurs in callback
    from the running context.
    
    This commit fixes the bug to release isochronous contexts always.

    spi: cadence: set cqspi to the driver_data field of struct device
    
    commit ea94191e584b146878f0b7fd4b767500d7aae870 upstream.
    
    When initialize cadence qspi controller, it is need to set cqspi
    to the driver_data field of struct device, because it will be
    used in function cqspi_remove/suspend/resume(). Otherwise, there
    will be a crash trace as below when invoking these finctions.
