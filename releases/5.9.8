    powercap: restrict energy meter to root access
    
    commit 949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71 upstream.
    
    Remove non-privileged user access to power data contained in
    /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl*/*/energy_uj
    
    Non-privileged users currently have read access to power data and can
    use this data to form a security attack. Some privileged
    drivers/applications need read access to this data, but don't expose it
    to non-privileged users.
    
    For example, thermald uses this data to ensure that power management
    works correctly. Thus removing non-privileged access is preferred over
    completely disabling this power reporting capability with
    CONFIG_INTEL_RAPL=n.
