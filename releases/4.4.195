    Btrfs: fix race setting up and completing qgroup rescan workers
    
    [ Upstream commit 13fc1d271a2e3ab8a02071e711add01fab9271f6 ]
    
    There is a race between setting up a qgroup rescan worker and completing
    a qgroup rescan worker that can lead to callers of the qgroup rescan wait
    ioctl to either not wait for the rescan worker to complete or to hang
    forever due to missing wake ups. The following diagram shows a sequence
    of steps that illustrates the race.
    
            CPU 1                                                         CPU 2                                  CPU 3
    
     btrfs_ioctl_quota_rescan()
      btrfs_qgroup_rescan()
       qgroup_rescan_init()
        mutex_lock(&fs_info->qgroup_rescan_lock)
        spin_lock(&fs_info->qgroup_lock)
    
        fs_info->qgroup_flags |=
          BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_RESCAN
    
        init_completion(
          &fs_info->qgroup_rescan_completion)
    
        fs_info->qgroup_rescan_running = true
    
        mutex_unlock(&fs_info->qgroup_rescan_lock)
        spin_unlock(&fs_info->qgroup_lock)
    
        btrfs_init_work()
         --> starts the worker
    
                                                            btrfs_qgroup_rescan_worker()
                                                             mutex_lock(&fs_info->qgroup_rescan_lock)
    
                                                             fs_info->qgroup_flags &=

                                                             starts transaction, updates qgroup status
                                                             item, etc

                                                                                                                    &fs_info->qgroup_rescan_completion)

                                                                                                                  mutex_unlock(&fs_info->qgroup_rescan_lock)
                                                                                                                  spin_unlock(&fs_info->qgroup_lock)

                                                                                                                   --> starts another worker
    
                                                             mutex_lock(&fs_info->qgroup_rescan_lock)
    
                                                             fs_info->qgroup_rescan_running = false
    
                                                             mutex_unlock(&fs_info->qgroup_rescan_lock)
    
                                                             complete_all(&fs_info->qgroup_rescan_completion)
    
    Before the rescan worker started by the task at CPU 3 completes, if
    another task calls btrfs_ioctl_quota_rescan(), it will get -EINPROGRESS
    because the flag BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_RESCAN is set at
    fs_info->qgroup_flags, which is expected and correct behaviour.
    
    However if other task calls btrfs_ioctl_quota_rescan_wait() before the
    rescan worker started by the task at CPU 3 completes, it will return
    immediately without waiting for the new rescan worker to complete,
    because fs_info->qgroup_rescan_running is set to false by CPU 2.
    
    This race is making test case btrfs/171 (from fstests) to fail often:
    
      btrfs/171 9s ... - output mismatch (see /home/fdmanana/git/hub/xfstests/results//btrfs/171.out.bad)

    That is because the test calls the btrfs-progs commands "qgroup quota
    rescan -w", "qgroup assign" and "qgroup remove" in a sequence that makes
    calls to the rescan start ioctl fail with -EINPROGRESS (note the "btrfs"
    commands 'qgroup assign' and 'qgroup remove' often call the rescan start
    ioctl after calling the qgroup assign ioctl,
    btrfs_ioctl_qgroup_assign()), since previous waits didn't actually wait
    for a rescan worker to complete.
    
    Another problem the race can cause is missing wake ups for waiters,
    since the call to complete_all() happens outside a critical section and
    after clearing the flag BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_RESCAN. In the sequence
    diagram above, if we have a waiter for the first rescan task (executed
    by CPU 2), then fs_info->qgroup_rescan_completion.wait is not empty, and
    if after the rescan worker clears BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_RESCAN and
    before it calls complete_all() against
    fs_info->qgroup_rescan_completion, the task at CPU 3 calls
    init_completion() against fs_info->qgroup_rescan_completion which
    re-initilizes its wait queue to an empty queue, therefore causing the
    rescan worker at CPU 2 to call complete_all() against an empty queue,
    never waking up the task waiting for that rescan worker.
    
    Fix this by clearing BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_RESCAN and setting
    fs_info->qgroup_rescan_running to false in the same critical section,
    delimited by the mutex fs_info->qgroup_rescan_lock, as well as doing the
    call to complete_all() in that same critical section. This gives the
    protection needed to avoid rescan wait ioctl callers not waiting for a
    running rescan worker and the lost wake ups problem, since setting that
    rescan flag and boolean as well as initializing the wait queue is done
    already in a critical section delimited by that mutex (at
    qgroup_rescan_init()).

    btrfs: Relinquish CPUs in btrfs_compare_trees
    
    commit 6af112b11a4bc1b560f60a618ac9c1dcefe9836e upstream.
    
    When doing any form of incremental send the parent and the child trees
    need to be compared via btrfs_compare_trees. This  can result in long
    loop chains without ever relinquishing the CPU. This causes softlockup
    detector to trigger when comparing trees with a lot of items. Example
    report:

    commit efad8a853ad2057f96664328a0d327a05ce39c76 upstream.
    
    At ctree.c:get_old_root(), we are accessing a root's header owner field
    after we have freed the respective extent buffer. This results in an
    use-after-free that can lead to crashes, and when CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
    is set, results in a stack trace like the following:

    ovl: filter of trusted xattr results in audit
    
    commit 5c2e9f346b815841f9bed6029ebcb06415caf640 upstream.
    
    When filtering xattr list for reading, presence of trusted xattr
    results in a security audit log.  However, if there is other content
    no errno will be set, and if there isn't, the errno will be -ENODATA
    and not -EPERM as is usually associated with a lack of capability.
    The check does not block the request to list the xattrs present.
    
    Switch to ns_capable_noaudit to reflect a more appropriate check.

    CIFS: Fix oplock handling for SMB 2.1+ protocols
    
    commit a016e2794fc3a245a91946038dd8f34d65e53cc3 upstream.
    
    There may be situations when a server negotiates SMB 2.1
    protocol version or higher but responds to a CREATE request
    with an oplock rather than a lease.
    
    Currently the client doesn't handle such a case correctly:
    when another CREATE comes in the server sends an oplock
    break to the initial CREATE and the client doesn't send
    an ack back due to a wrong caching level being set (READ
    instead of RWH). Missing an oplock break ack makes the
    server wait until the break times out which dramatically
    increases the latency of the second CREATE.
    
    Fix this by properly detecting oplocks when using SMB 2.1
    protocol version and higher.

    hwrng: core - don't wait on add_early_randomness()
    
    commit 78887832e76541f77169a24ac238fccb51059b63 upstream.
    
    add_early_randomness() is called by hwrng_register() when the
    hardware is added. If this hardware and its module are present
    at boot, and if there is no data available the boot hangs until
    data are available and can't be interrupted.
    
    For instance, in the case of virtio-rng, in some cases the host can be
    not able to provide enough entropy for all the guests.
    
    We can have two easy ways to reproduce the problem but they rely on
    misconfiguration of the hypervisor or the egd daemon:
    
    - if virtio-rng device is configured to connect to the egd daemon of the
    host but when the virtio-rng driver asks for data the daemon is not
    connected,
    
    - if virtio-rng device is configured to connect to the egd daemon of the
    host but the egd daemon doesn't provide data.
    
    The guest kernel will hang at boot until the virtio-rng driver provides
    enough data.
    
    To avoid that, call rng_get_data() in non-blocking mode (wait=0)
    from add_early_randomness().

    quota: fix wrong condition in is_quota_modification()

    /dev/mem: Bail out upon SIGKILL.
    
    commit 8619e5bdeee8b2c685d686281f2d2a6017c4bc15 upstream.
    
    syzbot found that a thread can stall for minutes inside read_mem() or
    write_mem() after that thread was killed by SIGKILL [1]. Reading from
    iomem areas of /dev/mem can be slow, depending on the hardware.
    While reading 2GB at one read() is legal, delaying termination of killed
    thread for minutes is bad. Thus, allow reading/writing /dev/mem and
    /dev/kmem to be preemptible and killable.
    
      [ 1335.912419][T20577] read_mem: sz=4096 count=2134565632
      [ 1335.943194][T20577] read_mem: sz=4096 count=2134561536

      [ 1336.041897][T20577] read_mem: sz=4096 count=2134549248
    
    Theoretically, reading/writing /dev/mem and /dev/kmem can become
    "interruptible". But this patch chose "killable". Future patch will make
    them "interruptible" so that we can revert to "killable" if some program
    regressed.

    cfg80211: Purge frame registrations on iftype change
    
    commit c1d3ad84eae35414b6b334790048406bd6301b12 upstream.
    
    Currently frame registrations are not purged, even when changing the
    interface type.  This can lead to potentially weird situations where
    frames possibly not allowed on a given interface type remain registered
    due to the type switching happening after registration.
    
    The kernel currently relies on userspace apps to actually purge the
    registrations themselves, this is not something that the kernel should
    rely on.
    
    Add a call to cfg80211_mlme_purge_registrations() to forcefully remove
    any registrations left over prior to switching the iftype.

    md/raid6: Set R5_ReadError when there is read failure on parity disk

    7471fb77ce4d ("md/raid6: Fix anomily when recovering a single device in
    RAID6.") avoids rereading P when it can be computed from other members.
    However, this misses the chance to re-write the right data to P. This
    patch sets R5_ReadError if the re-read fails.
    
    Also, when re-read is skipped, we also missed the chance to reset
    rdev->read_errors to 0. It can fail the disk when there are many read
    errors on P member disk (other disks don't have read error)
    
    V2: upper layer read request don't read parity/Q data. So there is no
    need to consider such situation.

    ARM: zynq: Use memcpy_toio instead of memcpy on smp bring-up
    
    commit b7005d4ef4f3aa2dc24019ffba03a322557ac43d upstream.
    
    This fixes a kernel panic on memcpy when
    FORTIFY_SOURCE is enabled.
    
    The initial smp implementation on commit aa7eb2bb4e4a
    ("arm: zynq: Add smp support")
    used memcpy, which worked fine until commit ee333554fed5
    ("ARM: 8749/1: Kconfig: Add ARCH_HAS_FORTIFY_SOURCE")
    enabled overflow checks at runtime, producing a read
    overflow panic.
    
    The computed size of memcpy args are:
    - p_size (dst): 4294967295 = (size_t) -1
    - q_size (src): 1
    - size (len): 8
    
    Additionally, the memory is marked as __iomem, so one of
    the memcpy_* functions should be used for read/write.

    KVM: x86: Manually calculate reserved bits when loading PDPTRS
    
    commit 16cfacc8085782dab8e365979356ce1ca87fd6cc upstream.
    
    Manually generate the PDPTR reserved bit mask when explicitly loading
    PDPTRs.  The reserved bits that are being tracked by the MMU reflect the
    current paging mode, which is unlikely to be PAE paging in the vast
    majority of flows that use load_pdptrs(), e.g. CR0 and CR4 emulation,
    __set_sregs(), etc...  This can cause KVM to incorrectly signal a bad
    PDPTR, or more likely, miss a reserved bit check and subsequently fail
    a VM-Enter due to a bad VMCS.GUEST_PDPTR.
    
    Add a one off helper to generate the reserved bits instead of sharing
    code across the MMU's calculations and the PDPTR emulation.  The PDPTR
    reserved bits are basically set in stone, and pushing a helper into
    the MMU's calculation adds unnecessary complexity without improving
    readability.
    
    Oppurtunistically fix/update the comment for load_pdptrs().
    
    Note, the buggy commit also introduced a deliberate functional change,
    "Also remove bit 5-6 from rsvd_bits_mask per latest SDM.", which was
    effectively (and correctly) reverted by commit cd9ae5fe47df ("KVM: x86:
    Fix page-tables reserved bits").  A bit of SDM archaeology shows that
    the SDM from late 2008 had a bug (likely a copy+paste error) where it
    listed bits 6:5 as AVL and A for PDPTEs used for 4k entries but reserved
    for 2mb entries.  I.e. the SDM contradicted itself, and bits 6:5 are and
    always have been reserved.

    KVM: x86: set ctxt->have_exception in x86_decode_insn()
    
    commit c8848cee74ff05638e913582a476bde879c968ad upstream.
    
    x86_emulate_instruction() takes into account ctxt->have_exception flag
    during instruction decoding, but in practice this flag is never set in
    x86_decode_insn().

    KVM: x86: always stop emulation on page fault
    
    commit 8530a79c5a9f4e29e6ffb35ec1a79d81f4968ec8 upstream.
    
    inject_emulated_exception() returns true if and only if nested page
    fault happens. However, page fault can come from guest page tables
    walk, either nested or not nested. In both cases we should stop an
    attempt to read under RIP and give guest to step over its own page
    fault handler.
    
    This is also visible when an emulated instruction causes a #GP fault
    and the VMware backdoor is enabled.  To handle the VMware backdoor,
    KVM intercepts #GP faults; with only the next patch applied,
    x86_emulate_instruction() injects a #GP but returns EMULATE_FAIL
    instead of EMULATE_DONE.   EMULATE_FAIL causes handle_exception_nmi()
    (or gp_interception() for SVM) to re-inject the original #GP because it
    thinks emulation failed due to a non-VMware opcode.  This patch prevents
    the issue as x86_emulate_instruction() will return EMULATE_DONE after
    injecting the #GP.

    parisc: Disable HP HSC-PCI Cards to prevent kernel crash
    
    commit 5fa1659105fac63e0f3c199b476025c2e04111ce upstream.
    
    The HP Dino PCI controller chip can be used in two variants: as on-board
    controller (e.g. in B160L), or on an Add-On card ("Card-Mode") to bridge
    PCI components to systems without a PCI bus, e.g. to a HSC/GSC bus.  One
    such Add-On card is the HP HSC-PCI Card which has one or more DEC Tulip
    PCI NIC chips connected to the on-card Dino PCI controller.
    
    Dino in Card-Mode has a big disadvantage: All PCI memory accesses need
    to go through the DINO_MEM_DATA register, so Linux drivers will not be
    able to use the ioremap() function. Without ioremap() many drivers will
    not work, one example is the tulip driver which then simply crashes the
    kernel if it tries to access the ports on the HP HSC card.
    
    This patch disables the HP HSC card if it finds one, and as such
    fixes the kernel crash on a HP D350/2 machine.

    printk: Do not lose last line in kmsg buffer dump
    
    [ Upstream commit b46eff55ad5bd98e746c0a7022fe7ee071de5fee ]
    
    kmsg_dump_get_buffer() is supposed to select all the youngest log
    messages which fit into the provided buffer.  It determines the correct
    start index by using msg_print_text() with a NULL buffer to calculate
    the size of each entry.  However, when performing the actual writes,
    msg_print_text() only writes the entry to the buffer if the written len
    is lesser than the size of the buffer.  So if the lengths of the
    selected youngest log messages happen to precisely fill up the provided
    buffer, the last log message is not included.
    
    We don't want to modify msg_print_text() to fill up the buffer and start
    returning a length which is equal to the size of the buffer, since
    callers of its other users, such as kmsg_dump_get_line(), depend upon
    the current behaviour.
    
    Instead, fix kmsg_dump_get_buffer() to compensate for this.
    
    For example, with the following two final prints:
    
    [    6.427502] AAAAAAAAAAAAA
    [    6.427769] BBBBBBBB12345

    ALSA: firewire-tascam: check intermediate state of clock status and retry
    
    commit e1a00b5b253a4f97216b9a33199a863987075162 upstream.
    
    2 bytes in MSB of register for clock status is zero during intermediate
    state after changing status of sampling clock in models of TASCAM FireWire
    series. The duration of this state differs depending on cases. During the
    state, it's better to retry reading the register for current status of
    the clock.
    
    In current implementation, the intermediate state is checked only when
    getting current sampling transmission frequency, then retry reading.
    This care is required for the other operations to read the register.
    
    This commit moves the codes of check and retry into helper function
    commonly used for operations to read the register.

    [CAUSE]
    This situation is caused by several factors:
    - Fuzzed image
      The extent tree of this fs missed one backref for extent tree root.
      So we can allocated space from that slot.
    
    - MIXED_BG feature
      Super block has MIXED_BG flag.
    
    - No mixed block groups exists
      All block groups are just regular ones.
    
    This makes data space_info->block_groups[] contains metadata block
    groups.  And when we reserve space for data, we can use space in
    metadata block group.
    
    Then we hit the following file operations:
    
    - fallocate
      We need to allocate data extents.
      find_free_extent() choose to use the metadata block to allocate space
      from, and choose the space of extent tree root, since its backref is
      missing.
    
      This generate one delayed ref head with is_data = 1.
    
    - extent tree update
      We need to update extent tree at run_delayed_ref time.
    
      This generate one delayed ref head with is_data = 0, for the same
      bytenr of old extent tree root.
    
    Then we trigger the BUG_ON().
    
    [FIX]
    The quick fix here is to check block_group->flags before using it.
    
    The problem can only happen for MIXED_GROUPS fs. Regular filesystems
    won't have space_info with DATA|METADATA flag, and no way to hit the
    bug.

    mmc: sdhci: Fix incorrect switch to HS mode
    
    [ Upstream commit c894e33ddc1910e14d6f2a2016f60ab613fd8b37 ]
    
    When switching from any MMC speed mode that requires 1.8v
    (HS200, HS400 and HS400ES) to High Speed (HS) mode, the system
    ends up configured for SDR12 with a 50MHz clock which is an illegal
    mode.
    
    This happens because the SDHCI_CTRL_VDD_180 bit in the
    SDHCI_HOST_CONTROL2 register is left set and when this bit is
    set, the speed mode is controlled by the SDHCI_CTRL_UHS field
    in the SDHCI_HOST_CONTROL2 register. The SDHCI_CTRL_UHS field
    will end up being set to 0 (SDR12) by sdhci_set_uhs_signaling()
    because there is no UHS mode being set.
    
    The fix is to change sdhci_set_uhs_signaling() to set the
    SDHCI_CTRL_UHS field to SDR25 (which is the same as HS) for
    any switch to HS mode.
    
    This was found on a new eMMC controller that does strict checking
    of the speed mode and the corresponding clock rate. It caused the
    switch to HS400 mode to fail because part of the sequence to switch
    to HS400 requires a switch from HS200 to HS before going to HS400.

    kprobes: Prohibit probing on BUG() and WARN() address
    
    [ Upstream commit e336b4027775cb458dc713745e526fa1a1996b2a ]
    
    Since BUG() and WARN() may use a trap (e.g. UD2 on x86) to
    get the address where the BUG() has occurred, kprobes can not
    do single-step out-of-line that instruction. So prohibit
    probing on such address.
    
    Without this fix, if someone put a kprobe on WARN(), the
    kernel will crash with invalid opcode error instead of
    outputing warning message, because kernel can not find
    correct bug address.

    hwmon: (acpi_power_meter) Change log level for 'unsafe software power cap'
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e4d91aa071810deac2cd052161aefb376ecf04e ]
    
    At boot time, the acpi_power_meter driver logs the following error level
    message: "Ignoring unsafe software power cap". Having read about it from
    a few sources, it seems that the error message can be quite misleading.
    
    While the message can imply that Linux is ignoring the fact that the
    system is operating in potentially dangerous conditions, the truth is
    the driver found an ACPI_PMC object that supports software power
    capping. The driver simply decides not to use it, perhaps because it
    doesn't support the object.
    
    The best solution is probably changing the log level from error to warning.
    All sources I have found, regarding the error, have downplayed its
    significance. There is not much of a reason for it to be on error level,
    while causing potential confusions or misinterpretations.

    ACPI / CPPC: do not require the _PSD method
    
    [ Upstream commit 4c4cdc4c63853fee48c02e25c8605fb65a6c9924 ]
    
    According to the ACPI 6.3 specification, the _PSD method is optional
    when using CPPC.  The underlying assumption is that each CPU can change
    frequency independently from all other CPUs; _PSD is provided to tell
    the OS that some processors can NOT do that.
    
    However, the acpi_get_psd() function returns ENODEV if there is no _PSD
    method present, or an ACPI error status if an error occurs when evaluating
    _PSD, if present.  This makes _PSD mandatory when using CPPC, in violation
    of the specification, and only on Linux.
    
    This has forced some firmware writers to provide a dummy _PSD, even though
    it is irrelevant, but only because Linux requires it; other OSPMs follow
    the spec.  We really do not want to have OS specific ACPI tables, though.
    
    So, correct acpi_get_psd() so that it does not return an error if there
    is no _PSD method present, but does return a failure when the method can
    not be executed properly.  This allows _PSD to be optional as it should
    be.

    Prevent mangling with gains with invalid values.
    
    As pointed by Sylvester, this should never happen in practice,
    as min value of V4L2_CID_GAIN control is 16 (gain is always >= 16
    and m is always >= 0), but it is too hard for a static analyzer
    to get this, as the logic with validates control min/max is
    elsewhere inside V4L2 core.

    [ Upstream commit 00c9755524fbaa28117be774d7c92fddb5ca02f3 ]
    
    When compile-testing on other architectures, we get lots of warnings
    about incorrect format strings, like:
    
       drivers/dma/iop-adma.c: In function 'iop_adma_alloc_slots':
       drivers/dma/iop-adma.c:307:6: warning: format '%x' expects argument of type 'unsigned int', but argument 6 has type 'dma_addr_t {aka long long unsigned int}' [-Wformat=]

    >> drivers/dma/iop-adma.c:518:40: warning: format '%u' expects argument of type 'unsigned int', but argument 5 has type 'size_t {aka long unsigned int}' [-Wformat=]
    
    Use %zu for printing size_t as required, and cast the dma_addr_t
    arguments to 'u64' for printing with %llx. Ideally this should use
    the %pad format string, but that requires an lvalue argument that
    doesn't work here.

    efi: cper: print AER info of PCIe fatal error
    
    [ Upstream commit b194a77fcc4001dc40aecdd15d249648e8a436d1 ]
    
    AER info of PCIe fatal error is not printed in the current driver.
    Because APEI driver will panic directly for fatal error, and can't
    run to the place of printing AER info.
    
    An example log is as following:
    {763}[Hardware Error]: Hardware error from APEI Generic Hardware Error Source: 11
    {763}[Hardware Error]: event severity: fatal
    {763}[Hardware Error]:  Error 0, type: fatal
    {763}[Hardware Error]:   section_type: PCIe error
    {763}[Hardware Error]:   port_type: 0, PCIe end point

    {763}[Hardware Error]:   class_code: 000002
    Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal hardware error!
    
    This issue was imported by the patch, '37448adfc7ce ("aerdrv: Move
    cper_print_aer() call out of interrupt context")'. To fix this issue,
    this patch adds print of AER info in cper_print_pcie() for fatal error.
    
    Here is the example log after this patch applied:
    {24}[Hardware Error]: Hardware error from APEI Generic Hardware Error Source: 10
    {24}[Hardware Error]: event severity: fatal

    md: don't set In_sync if array is frozen
    
    [ Upstream commit 062f5b2ae12a153644c765e7ba3b0f825427be1d ]
    
    When a disk is added to array, the following path is called in mdadm.
    
    Manage_subdevs -> sysfs_freeze_array
                   -> Manage_add
                   -> sysfs_set_str(&info, NULL, "sync_action","idle")
    
    Then from kernel side, Manage_add invokes the path (add_new_disk ->
    validate_super = super_1_validate) to set In_sync flag.
    
    Since In_sync means "device is in_sync with rest of array", and the new
    added disk need to resync thread to help the synchronization of data.
    And md_reap_sync_thread would call spare_active to set In_sync for the
    new added disk finally. So don't set In_sync if array is in frozen.

    [ Upstream commit 0d8ed0e9bf9643f27f4816dca61081784dedb38d ]
    
    When add one disk to array, the md_reap_sync_thread is responsible
    to activate the spare and set In_sync flag for the new member in
    spare_active().
    
    But if raid1 has one member disk A, and disk B is added to the array.
    Then we offline A before all the datas are synchronized from A to B,
    obviously B doesn't have the latest data as A, but B is still marked
    with In_sync flag.
    
    So let's not call spare_active under the condition, otherwise B is
    still showed with 'U' state which is not correct.

    [ Upstream commit 1b34121d9f26d272b0b2334209af6b6fc82d4bf1 ]
    
    The Linux kernel assumes that get_endpoint(alts,0) and
    get_endpoint(alts,1) are eachothers feedback endpoints.
    To reassure that validity it will test bsynchaddress to comply with that
    assumption. But if the bsyncaddress is 0 (invalid), it will flag that as
    a wrong assumption and return an error.
    Fix: Skip the test if bSynchAddress is 0.
    Note: those with a valid bSynchAddress should have a code quirck added.

    [ Upstream commit 2127c01b7f63b06a21559f56a8c81a3c6535bd1a ]
    
    In build_adc_controls(), there is an if statement on line 773 to check

    Thus, a possible null-pointer dereference may occur.
    
    To fix this bug, referring to lines 773 and 774, ak->adc_info
    and ak->adc_info[mixer_ch].selector_name are checked before being used.

    x86/reboot: Always use NMI fallback when shutdown via reboot vector IPI fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 747d5a1bf293dcb33af755a6d285d41b8c1ea010 ]
    
    A reboot request sends an IPI via the reboot vector and waits for all other
    CPUs to stop. If one or more CPUs are in critical regions with interrupts
    disabled then the IPI is not handled on those CPUs and the shutdown hangs
    if native_stop_other_cpus() is called with the wait argument set.
    
    Such a situation can happen when one CPU was stopped within a lock held
    section and another CPU is trying to acquire that lock with interrupts
    disabled. There are other scenarios which can cause such a lockup as well.
    
    In theory the shutdown should be attempted by an NMI IPI after the timeout
    period elapsed. Though the wait loop after sending the reboot vector IPI
    prevents this. It checks the wait request argument and the timeout. If wait
    is set, which is true for sys_reboot() then it won't fall through to the
    NMI shutdown method after the timeout period has finished.
    
    This was an oversight when the NMI shutdown mechanism was added to handle
    the 'reboot IPI is not working' situation. The mechanism was added to deal
    with stuck panic shutdowns, which do not have the wait request set, so the
    'wait request' case was probably not considered.
    
    Remove the wait check from the post reboot vector IPI wait loop and enforce
    that the wait loop in the NMI fallback path is invoked even if NMI IPIs are
    disabled or the registration of the NMI handler fails. That second wait
    loop will then hang if not all CPUs shutdown and the wait argument is set.

    sched/core: Fix CPU controller for !RT_GROUP_SCHED
    
    [ Upstream commit a07db5c0865799ebed1f88be0df50c581fb65029 ]
    
    On !CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED configurations it is currently not possible to
    move RT tasks between cgroups to which CPU controller has been attached;
    but it is oddly possible to first move tasks around and then make them
    RT (setschedule to FIFO/RR).
    
    E.g.:
    
      # mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct/group1
      # chrt -fp 10 $$
      # echo $$ > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct/group1/tasks
      bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
      # chrt -op 0 $$
      # echo $$ > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct/group1/tasks
      # chrt -fp 10 $$
      # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct/group1/tasks
      2345
      2598
      # chrt -p 2345
      pid 2345's current scheduling policy: SCHED_FIFO
      pid 2345's current scheduling priority: 10
    
    Also, as Michal noted, it is currently not possible to enable CPU
    controller on unified hierarchy with !CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED (if there
    are any kernel RT threads in root cgroup, they can't be migrated to the
    newly created CPU controller's root in cgroup_update_dfl_csses()).
    
    Existing code comes with a comment saying the "we don't support RT-tasks
    being in separate groups". Such comment is however stale and belongs to
    pre-RT_GROUP_SCHED times. Also, it doesn't make much sense for
    !RT_GROUP_ SCHED configurations, since checks related to RT bandwidth
    are not performed at all in these cases.
    
    Make moving RT tasks between CPU controller groups viable by removing
    special case check for RT (and DEADLINE) tasks.

    sched/fair: Fix imbalance due to CPU affinity
    
    [ Upstream commit f6cad8df6b30a5d2bbbd2e698f74b4cafb9fb82b ]
    
    The load_balance() has a dedicated mecanism to detect when an imbalance
    is due to CPU affinity and must be handled at parent level. In this case,
    the imbalance field of the parent's sched_group is set.
    
    The description of sg_imbalanced() gives a typical example of two groups
    of 4 CPUs each and 4 tasks each with a cpumask covering 1 CPU of the first
    group and 3 CPUs of the second group. Something like:
    
            { 0 1 2 3 } { 4 5 6 7 }
                    *     * * *
    
    But the load_balance fails to fix this UC on my octo cores system
    made of 2 clusters of quad cores.
    
    Whereas the load_balance is able to detect that the imbalanced is due to
    CPU affinity, it fails to fix it because the imbalance field is cleared
    before letting parent level a chance to run. In fact, when the imbalance is
    detected, the load_balance reruns without the CPU with pinned tasks. But
    there is no other running tasks in the situation described above and
    everything looks balanced this time so the imbalance field is immediately
    cleared.
    
    The imbalance field should not be cleared if there is no other task to move
    when the imbalance is detected.

    [ Upstream commit 765bb8610d305ee488b35d07e2a04ae52fb2df9c ]
    
    When CONFIG_DVB_DIB9000 is disabled, we can still compile code that
    now fails to link against dibx000_i2c_set_speed:
    
    drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dib0700_devices.o: In function `dib01x0_pmu_update.constprop.7':
    dib0700_devices.c:(.text.unlikely+0x1c9c): undefined reference to `dibx000_i2c_set_speed'
    
    The call sites are both through dib01x0_pmu_update(), which gets passed
    an 'i2c' pointer from dib9000_get_i2c_master(), which has returned
    NULL. Checking this pointer seems to be a good idea anyway, and it avoids
    the link failure in most cases.
    
    Sean Young found another case that is not fixed by that, where certain
    gcc versions leave an unused function in place that causes the link error,
    but adding an explict IS_ENABLED() check also solves this.

    leds: leds-lp5562 allow firmware files up to the maximum length
    
    [ Upstream commit ed2abfebb041473092b41527903f93390d38afa7 ]
    
    Firmware files are in ASCII, using 2 hex characters per byte. The
    maximum length of a firmware string is therefore
    
    16 (commands) * 2 (bytes per command) * 2 (characters per byte) = 64

    drm: Flush output polling on shutdown
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b295cb1a411d9c82bbfaa66bc17a8508716ed07 ]
    
    We need to mark the output polling as disabled to prevent concurrent
    irqs from queuing new work as shutdown the probe -- causing that work to
    execute after we have freed the structs:

    f2fs: fix to do sanity check on segment bitmap of LFS curseg
    
    [ Upstream commit c854f4d681365498f53ba07843a16423625aa7e9 ]

    The testcase fails because that, in fuzzed image, current segment was
    allocated with LFS type, its .next_blkoff should point to an unused
    block address, but actually, its bitmap shows it's not. So during
    allocation, f2fs crash when setting bitmap.
    
    Introducing sanity_check_curseg() to check such inconsistence of
    current in-used segment.

    Revert "f2fs: avoid out-of-range memory access"
    
    [ Upstream commit a37d0862d17411edb67677a580a6f505ec2225f6 ]
    
    As Pavel Machek reported:
    
    "We normally use -EUCLEAN to signal filesystem corruption. Plus, it is
    good idea to report it to the syslog and mark filesystem as "needing
    fsck" if filesystem can do that."
    
    Still we need improve the original patch with:
    - use unlikely keyword
    - add message print
    - return EUCLEAN
    
    However, after rethink this patch, I don't think we should add such
    condition check here as below reasons:
    - We have already checked the field in f2fs_sanity_check_ckpt(),
    - If there is fs corrupt or security vulnerability, there is nothing
    to guarantee the field is integrated after the check, unless we do
    the check before each of its use, however no filesystem does that.
    - We only have similar check for bitmap, which was added due to there
    is bitmap corruption happened on f2fs' runtime in product.
    - There are so many key fields in SB/CP/NAT did have such check
    after f2fs_sanity_check_{sb,cp,..}.
    
    So I propose to revert this unneeded check.
    
    This reverts commit 56f3ce675103e3fb9e631cfb4131fc768bc23e9a.

    f2fs: check all the data segments against all node ones
    
    [ Upstream commit 1166c1f2f69117ad254189ca781287afa6e550b6 ]
    
    As a part of the sanity checking while mounting, distinct segment number
    assignment to data and node segments is verified. Fixing a small bug in

    irqchip/gic-v3-its: Fix LPI release for Multi-MSI devices
    
    [ Upstream commit c9c96e30ecaa0aafa225aa1a5392cb7db17c7a82 ]
    
    When allocating a range of LPIs for a Multi-MSI capable device,
    this allocation extended to the closest power of 2.
    
    But on the release path, the interrupts are released one by
    one. This results in not releasing the "extra" range, leaking
    the its_device. Trying to reprobe the device will then fail.
    
    Fix it by releasing the LPIs the same way we allocate them.

    locking/lockdep: Add debug_locks check in __lock_downgrade()
    
    [ Upstream commit 513e1073d52e55b8024b4f238a48de7587c64ccf ]
    
    Tetsuo Handa had reported he saw an incorrect "downgrading a read lock"
    warning right after a previous lockdep warning. It is likely that the
    previous warning turned off lock debugging causing the lockdep to have
    inconsistency states leading to the lock downgrade warning.
    
    Fix that by add a check for debug_locks at the beginning of
    __lock_downgrade().

    mac80211: handle deauthentication/disassociation from TDLS peer
    
    [ Upstream commit 79c92ca42b5a3e0ea172ea2ce8df8e125af237da ]
    
    When receiving a deauthentication/disassociation frame from a TDLS
    peer, a station should not disconnect the current AP, but only
    disable the current TDLS link if it's enabled.
    
    Without this change, a TDLS issue can be reproduced by following the
    steps as below:
    
    1. STA-1 and STA-2 are connected to AP, bidirection traffic is running
       between STA-1 and STA-2.
    2. Set up TDLS link between STA-1 and STA-2, stay for a while, then
       teardown TDLS link.
    3. Repeat step #2 and monitor the connection between STA and AP.
    
    During the test, one STA may send a deauthentication/disassociation
    frame to another, after TDLS teardown, with reason code 6/7, which
    means: Class 2/3 frame received from nonassociated STA.
    
    On receive this frame, the receiver STA will disconnect the current
    AP and then reconnect. It's not a expected behavior, purpose of this
    frame should be disabling the TDLS link, not the link with AP.

    mtd: cfi_cmdset_0002: Use chip_good() to retry in do_write_oneword()
    
    commit 37c673ade35c707d50583b5b25091ff8ebdeafd7 upstream.
    
    As reported by the OpenWRT team, write requests sometimes fail on some
    platforms.
    Currently to check the state chip_ready() is used correctly as described by
    the flash memory S29GL256P11TFI01 datasheet.
    Also chip_good() is used to check if the write is succeeded and it was
    implemented by the commit fb4a90bfcd6d8 ("[MTD] CFI-0002 - Improve error
    checking").
    But actually the write failure is caused on some platforms and also it can
    be fixed by using chip_good() to check the state and retry instead.
    Also it seems that it is caused after repeated about 1,000 times to retry
    the write one word with the reset command.
    By using chip_good() to check the state to be done it can be reduced the
    retry with reset.
    It is depended on the actual flash chip behavior so the root cause is
    unknown.

    HID: hidraw: Fix invalid read in hidraw_ioctl
    
    commit 416dacb819f59180e4d86a5550052033ebb6d72c upstream.
    
    The syzbot fuzzer has reported a pair of problems in the

    read.  An example of the first:

    The two problems have the same cause: hidraw_ioctl() fails to test
    whether the device has been removed.  This patch adds the missing test.

    It turns out the fault was caused by a bug in the HID Logitech driver,
    which violates the requirement that every pathway calling
    hid_hw_start() must also call hid_hw_stop().  This patch fixes the bug
    by making sure the requirement is met.

    HID: lg: make transfer buffers DMA capable
    
    commit 061232f0d47fa10103f3efa3e890f002a930d902 upstream.
    
    Kernel v4.9 strictly enforces DMA capable buffers, so we need to remove
    buffers allocated on the stack.

    HID: prodikeys: Fix general protection fault during probe
    
    commit 98375b86c79137416e9fd354177b85e768c16e56 upstream.
    
    The syzbot fuzzer provoked a general protection fault in the
    hid-prodikeys driver:
    
    kasan: CONFIG_KASAN_INLINE enabled
    kasan: GPF could be caused by NULL-ptr deref or user memory access
    general protection fault: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN
    CPU: 0 PID: 12 Comm: kworker/0:1 Not tainted 5.3.0-rc5+ #28
    Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS

    85 13 04 00 00 48 ba 00 00 00 00 00 fc ff df 49 8b
    
    The problem is caused by the fact that pcmidi_get_output_report() will
    return an error if the HID device doesn't provide the right sort of
    output report, but pcmidi_set_operational() doesn't bother to check
    the return code and assumes the function call always succeeds.
    
    This patch adds the missing check and aborts the probe operation if
    necessary.

    Revert "Bluetooth: validate BLE connection interval updates"
    
    [ Upstream commit 68d19d7d995759b96169da5aac313363f92a9075 ]
    
    This reverts commit c49a8682fc5d298d44e8d911f4fa14690ea9485e.
    
    There are devices which require low connection intervals for usable operation
    including keyboards and mice. Forcing a static connection interval for
    these types of devices has an impact in latency and causes a regression.
