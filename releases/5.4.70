    netfilter: ctnetlink: add a range check for l3/l4 protonum
    
    commit 1cc5ef91d2ff94d2bf2de3b3585423e8a1051cb6 upstream.
    
    The indexes to the nf_nat_l[34]protos arrays come from userspace. So
    check the tuple's family, e.g. l3num, when creating the conntrack in
    order to prevent an OOB memory access during setup.  Here is an example
    kernel panic on 4.14.180 when userspace passes in an index greater than
    NFPROTO_NUMPROTO.

    epoll: EPOLL_CTL_ADD: close the race in decision to take fast path
    
    commit fe0a916c1eae8e17e86c3753d13919177d63ed7e upstream.
    
    Checking for the lack of epitems refering to the epoll we want to insert into
    is not enough; we might have an insertion of that epoll into another one that
    has already collected the set of files to recheck for excessive reverse paths,
    but hasn't gotten to creating/inserting the epitem for it.
    
    However, any such insertion in progress can be detected - it will update the
    generation count in our epoll when it's done looking through it for files
    to check.  That gets done under ->mtx of our epoll and that allows us to
    detect that safely.
    
    We are *not* holding epmutex here, so the generation count is not stable.
    However, since both the update of ep->gen by loop check and (later)
    insertion into ->f_ep_link are done with ep->mtx held, we are fine -
    the sequence is
            grab epmutex
            bump loop_check_gen
            ...
            grab tep->mtx           // 1
            tep->gen = loop_check_gen
            ...
            drop tep->mtx           // 2
            ...
            grab tep->mtx           // 3
            ...
            insert into ->f_ep_link
            ...
            drop tep->mtx           // 4
            bump loop_check_gen
            drop epmutex
    and if the fastpath check in another thread happens for that
    eventpoll, it can come
            * before (1) - in that case fastpath is just fine
            * after (4) - we'll see non-empty ->f_ep_link, slow path
    taken
            * between (2) and (3) - loop_check_gen is stable,
    with ->mtx providing barriers and we end up taking slow path.
    
    Note that ->f_ep_link emptiness check is slightly racy - we are protected
    against insertions into that list, but removals can happen right under us.
    Not a problem - in the worst case we'll end up taking a slow path for
    no good reason.

    mm: don't rely on system state to detect hot-plug operations
    
    commit f85086f95fa36194eb0db5cd5c12e56801b98523 upstream.
    
    In register_mem_sect_under_node() the system_state's value is checked to
    detect whether the call is made during boot time or during an hot-plug
    operation.  Unfortunately, that check against SYSTEM_BOOTING is wrong
    because regular memory is registered at SYSTEM_SCHEDULING state.  In
    addition, memory hot-plug operation can be triggered at this system
    state by the ACPI [1].  So checking against the system state is not
    enough.
    
    The consequence is that on system with interleaved node's ranges like this:
    
     Early memory node ranges
       node   1: [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000011fffffff]
       node   2: [mem 0x0000000120000000-0x000000014fffffff]
       node   1: [mem 0x0000000150000000-0x00000001ffffffff]
       node   0: [mem 0x0000000200000000-0x000000048fffffff]
       node   2: [mem 0x0000000490000000-0x00000007ffffffff]
    
    This can be seen on PowerPC LPAR after multiple memory hot-plug and
    hot-unplug operations are done.  At the next reboot the node's memory
    ranges can be interleaved and since the call to link_mem_sections() is
    made in topology_init() while the system is in the SYSTEM_SCHEDULING
    state, the node's id is not checked, and the sections registered to
    multiple nodes:
    
      $ ls -l /sys/devices/system/memory/memory21/node*
      total 0
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     0 Aug 24 05:27 node1 -> ../../node/node1
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     0 Aug 24 05:27 node2 -> ../../node/node2
    
    In that case, the system is able to boot but if later one of theses
    memory blocks is hot-unplugged and then hot-plugged, the sysfs
    inconsistency is detected and this is triggering a BUG_ON():

    mm: replace memmap_context by meminit_context
    
    commit c1d0da83358a2316d9be7f229f26126dbaa07468 upstream.
    
    Patch series "mm: fix memory to node bad links in sysfs", v3.
    
    Sometimes, firmware may expose interleaved memory layout like this:
    
     Early memory node ranges
       node   1: [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000011fffffff]
       node   2: [mem 0x0000000120000000-0x000000014fffffff]
       node   1: [mem 0x0000000150000000-0x00000001ffffffff]
       node   0: [mem 0x0000000200000000-0x000000048fffffff]
       node   2: [mem 0x0000000490000000-0x00000007ffffffff]
    
    In that case, we can see memory blocks assigned to multiple nodes in
    sysfs:
    
      $ ls -l /sys/devices/system/memory/memory21
      total 0
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     0 Aug 24 05:27 node1 -> ../../node/node1
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     0 Aug 24 05:27 node2 -> ../../node/node2
      -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 65536 Aug 24 05:27 online
      -r--r--r-- 1 root root 65536 Aug 24 05:27 phys_device
      -r--r--r-- 1 root root 65536 Aug 24 05:27 phys_index
      drwxr-xr-x 2 root root     0 Aug 24 05:27 power
      -r--r--r-- 1 root root 65536 Aug 24 05:27 removable
      -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 65536 Aug 24 05:27 state
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     0 Aug 24 05:25 subsystem -> ../../../../bus/memory
      -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 65536 Aug 24 05:25 uevent
      -r--r--r-- 1 root root 65536 Aug 24 05:27 valid_zones
    
    The same applies in the node's directory with a memory21 link in both
    the node1 and node2's directory.
    
    This is wrong but doesn't prevent the system to run.  However when
    later, one of these memory blocks is hot-unplugged and then hot-plugged,
    the system is detecting an inconsistency in the sysfs layout and a
    BUG_ON() is raised:

    This has been seen on PowerPC LPAR.
    
    The root cause of this issue is that when node's memory is registered,
    the range used can overlap another node's range, thus the memory block
    is registered to multiple nodes in sysfs.
    
    There are two issues here:
    
     (a) The sysfs memory and node's layouts are broken due to these
         multiple links
    
     (b) The link errors in link_mem_sections() should not lead to a system
         panic.
    
    To address (a) register_mem_sect_under_node should not rely on the
    system state to detect whether the link operation is triggered by a hot
    plug operation or not.  This is addressed by the patches 1 and 2 of this
    series.
    
    Issue (b) will be addressed separately.
    
    This patch (of 2):
    
    The memmap_context enum is used to detect whether a memory operation is
    due to a hot-add operation or happening at boot time.
    
    Make it general to the hotplug operation and rename it as
    meminit_context.
    
    There is no functional change introduced by this patch

    block/diskstats: more accurate approximation of io_ticks for slow disks
    
    commit 2b8bd423614c595540eaadcfbc702afe8e155e50 upstream.
    
    Currently io_ticks is approximated by adding one at each start and end of
    requests if jiffies counter has changed. This works perfectly for requests
    shorter than a jiffy or if one of requests starts/ends at each jiffy.
    
    If disk executes just one request at a time and they are longer than two
    jiffies then only first and last jiffies will be accounted.
    
    Fix is simple: at the end of request add up into io_ticks jiffies passed
    since last update rather than just one jiffy.
    
    Example: common HDD executes random read 4k requests around 12ms.
    
    fio --name=test --filename=/dev/sdb --rw=randread --direct=1 --runtime=30 &
    iostat -x 10 sdb
    
    Note changes of iostat's "%util" 8,43% -> 99,99% before/after patch:
    
    Before:
    
    Device:         rrqm/s   wrqm/s     r/s     w/s    rkB/s    wkB/s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz   await r_await w_await  svctm  %util
    sdb               0,00     0,00   82,60    0,00   330,40     0,00     8,00     0,96   12,09   12,09    0,00   1,02   8,43
    
    After:
    
    Device:         rrqm/s   wrqm/s     r/s     w/s    rkB/s    wkB/s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz   await r_await w_await  svctm  %util
    sdb               0,00     0,00   82,50    0,00   330,00     0,00     8,00     1,00   12,10   12,10    0,00  12,12  99,99
    
    Now io_ticks does not loose time between start and end of requests, but
    for queue-depth > 1 some I/O time between adjacent starts might be lost.
    
    For load estimation "%util" is not as useful as average queue length,
    but it clearly shows how often disk queue is completely empty.

    Commit f227e3ec3b5c ("random32: update the net random state on interrupt
    and activity") broke compilation and was temporarily fixed by Linus in
    83bdc7275e62 ("random32: remove net_rand_state from the latent entropy
    gcc plugin") by entirely moving net_rand_state out of the things handled
    by the latent_entropy GCC plugin.
    
    From what I understand when reading the plugin code, using the
    __latent_entropy attribute on a declaration was the wrong part and
    simply keeping the __latent_entropy attribute on the variable definition
    was the correct fix.

    gpio/aspeed-sgpio: enable access to all 80 input & output sgpios
    
    [ Upstream commit ac67b07e268d46eba675a60c37051bb3e59fd201 ]
    
    Currently, the aspeed-sgpio driver exposes up to 80 GPIO lines,
    corresponding to the 80 status bits available in hardware. Each of these
    lines can be configured as either an input or an output.
    
    However, each of these GPIOs is actually an input *and* an output; we
    actually have 80 inputs plus 80 outputs.
    
    This change expands the maximum number of GPIOs to 160; the lower half
    of this range are the input-only GPIOs, the upper half are the outputs.
    We fix the GPIO directions to correspond to this mapping.
    
    This also fixes a bug when setting GPIOs - we were reading from the
    input register, making it impossible to set more than one output GPIO.

    Commit bff1cef5f23a ("clk: tegra: Don't enable already enabled PLLs")
    added checks to avoid enabling PLLs that have already been enabled by
    the bootloader. However, the PLL_E configuration inherited from the
    bootloader isn't necessarily the one that is needed for the kernel.
    
    This can cause SATA to fail like this:
    
        [    5.310270] phy phy-sata.6: phy poweron failed --> -110
        [    5.315604] tegra-ahci 70027000.sata: failed to power on AHCI controller: -110
        [    5.323022] tegra-ahci: probe of 70027000.sata failed with error -110
    
    Fix this by always programming the PLL_E. This ensures that any mis-
    configuration by the bootloader will be overwritten by the kernel.

    nfs: Fix security label length not being reset
    
    [ Upstream commit d33030e2ee3508d65db5644551435310df86010e ]
    
    nfs_readdir_page_filler() iterates over entries in a directory, reusing
    the same security label buffer, but does not reset the buffer's length.
    This causes decode_attr_security_label() to return -ERANGE if an entry's
    security label is longer than the previous one's. This error, in
    nfs4_decode_dirent(), only gets passed up as -EAGAIN, which causes another
    failed attempt to copy into the buffer. The second error is ignored and
    the remaining entries do not show up in ls, specifically the getdents64()
    syscall.
    
    Reproduce by creating multiple files in NFS and giving one of the later
    files a longer security label. ls will not see that file nor any that are
    added afterwards, though they will exist on the backend.
    
    In nfs_readdir_page_filler(), reset security label buffer length before

    [ Upstream commit 5fcface659aab7eac4bd65dd116d98b8f7bb88d5 ]
    
    The raw interrupt status of GPIO maybe set before the interrupt is enabled,
    which would trigger the interrupt event once enabled it from user side.
    This is the case for edge interrupts only. Adding a clear operation when
    setting interrupt type can avoid that.
    
    There're a few considerations for the solution:
    1) This issue is for edge interrupt only; The interrupts requested by users
       are IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH as default, so clearing interrupt when request
       is useless.
    2) The interrupt type can be set to edge when request and following up
       with clearing it though, but the problem is still there once users set
       the interrupt type to level trggier.
    3) We can add a clear operation after each time of setting interrupt
       enable bit, but it is redundant for level trigger interrupt.
    
    Therefore, the solution is this patch seems the best for now.

    nvme-fc: fail new connections to a deleted host or remote port
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e0e8dac985d4bd07d9e62922b9d189d3ca2fccf ]
    
    The lldd may have made calls to delete a remote port or local port and
    the delete is in progress when the cli then attempts to create a new
    controller. Currently, this proceeds without error although it can't be
    very successful.
    
    Fix this by validating that both the host port and remote port are
    present when a new controller is to be created.

    nvme-pci: fix NULL req in completion handler
    
    [ Upstream commit 50b7c24390a53c78de546215282fb52980f1d7b7 ]
    
    Currently, we use nvmeq->q_depth as the upper limit for a valid tag in
    nvme_handle_cqe(), it is not correct. Because the available tag number
    is recorded in tagset, which is not equal to nvmeq->q_depth.
    
    The nvme driver registers interrupts for queues before initializing the
    tagset, because it uses the number of successful request_irq() calls to
    configure the tagset parameters. This allows a race condition with the
    current tag validity check if the controller happens to produce an
    interrupt with a corrupted CQE before the tagset is initialized.
    
    Replace the driver's indirect tag check with the one already provided by
    the block layer.

    spi: fsl-espi: Only process interrupts for expected events
    
    [ Upstream commit b867eef4cf548cd9541225aadcdcee644669b9e1 ]
    
    The SPIE register contains counts for the TX FIFO so any time the irq
    handler was invoked we would attempt to process the RX/TX fifos. Use the
    SPIM value to mask the events so that we only process interrupts that
    were expected.
    
    This was a latent issue exposed by commit 3282a3da25bd ("powerpc/64:

    tracing: Make the space reserved for the pid wider
    
    [ Upstream commit 795d6379a47bcbb88bd95a69920e4acc52849f88 ]
    
    For 64bit CONFIG_BASE_SMALL=0 systems PID_MAX_LIMIT is set by default to
    4194304. During boot the kernel sets a new value based on number of CPUs
    but no lower than 32768. It is 1024 per CPU so with 128 CPUs the default
    becomes 131072 which needs six digits.
    This value can be increased during run time but must not exceed the
    initial upper limit.
    
    Systemd sometime after v241 sets it to the upper limit during boot. The
    result is that when the pid exceeds five digits, the trace output is a
    little hard to read because it is no longer properly padded (same like
    on big iron with 98+ CPUs).
    
    Increase the pid padding to seven digits.

    drivers/net/wan/hdlc: Set skb->protocol before transmitting
    
    [ Upstream commit 9fb030a70431a2a2a1b292dbf0b2f399cc072c16 ]
    
    This patch sets skb->protocol before transmitting frames on the HDLC
    device, so that a user listening on the HDLC device with an AF_PACKET
    socket will see outgoing frames' sll_protocol field correctly set and
    consistent with that of incoming frames.
    
    1. Control frames in hdlc_cisco and hdlc_ppp
    
    When these drivers send control frames, skb->protocol is not set.
    
    This value should be set to htons(ETH_P_HDLC), because when receiving
    control frames, their skb->protocol is set to htons(ETH_P_HDLC).
    
    When receiving, hdlc_type_trans in hdlc.h is called, which then calls
    cisco_type_trans or ppp_type_trans. The skb->protocol of control frames
    is set to htons(ETH_P_HDLC) so that the control frames can be received
    by hdlc_rcv in hdlc.c, which calls cisco_rx or ppp_rx to process the
    control frames.
    
    2. hdlc_fr
    
    When this driver sends control frames, skb->protocol is set to internal
    values used in this driver.
    
    When this driver sends data frames (from upper stacked PVC devices),
    skb->protocol is the same as that of the user data packet being sent on
    the upper PVC device (for normal PVC devices), or is htons(ETH_P_802_3)
    (for Ethernet-emulating PVC devices).
    
    However, skb->protocol for both control frames and data frames should be
    set to htons(ETH_P_HDLC), because when receiving, all frames received on
    the HDLC device will have their skb->protocol set to htons(ETH_P_HDLC).
    
    When receiving, hdlc_type_trans in hdlc.h is called, and because this
    driver doesn't provide a type_trans function in struct hdlc_proto,
    all frames will have their skb->protocol set to htons(ETH_P_HDLC).
    The frames are then received by hdlc_rcv in hdlc.c, which calls fr_rx
    to process the frames (control frames are consumed and data frames
    are re-received on upper PVC devices).

    drivers/net/wan/lapbether: Make skb->protocol consistent with the header
    
    [ Upstream commit 83f9a9c8c1edc222846dc1bde6e3479703e8e5a3 ]
    
    This driver is a virtual driver stacked on top of Ethernet interfaces.
    
    When this driver transmits data on the Ethernet device, the skb->protocol
    setting is inconsistent with the Ethernet header prepended to the skb.
    
    This causes a user listening on the Ethernet interface with an AF_PACKET
    socket, to see different sll_protocol values for incoming and outgoing
    frames, because incoming frames would have this value set by parsing the
    Ethernet header.
    
    This patch changes the skb->protocol value for outgoing Ethernet frames,
    making it consistent with the Ethernet header prepended. This makes a
    user listening on the Ethernet device with an AF_PACKET socket, to see
    the same sll_protocol value for incoming and outgoing frames.

    rndis_host: increase sleep time in the query-response loop
    
    [ Upstream commit 4202c9fdf03d79dedaa94b2c4cf574f25793d669 ]
    
    Some WinCE devices face connectivity issues via the NDIS interface. They
    fail to register, resulting in -110 timeout errors and failures during the
    probe procedure.
    
    In this kind of WinCE devices, the Windows-side ndis driver needs quite
    more time to be loaded and configured, so that the linux rndis host queries
    to them fail to be responded correctly on time.
    
    More specifically, when INIT is called on the WinCE side - no other
    requests can be served by the Client and this results in a failed QUERY
    afterwards.
    
    The increase of the waiting time on the side of the linux rndis host in
    the command-response loop leaves the INIT process to complete and respond
    to a QUERY, which comes afterwards. The WinCE devices with this special
    "feature" in their ndis driver are satisfied by this fix.

    drivers/net/wan/hdlc_fr: Add needed_headroom for PVC devices
    
    [ Upstream commit 44a049c42681de71c783d75cd6e56b4e339488b0 ]
    
    PVC devices are virtual devices in this driver stacked on top of the
    actual HDLC device. They are the devices normal users would use.
    PVC devices have two types: normal PVC devices and Ethernet-emulating
    PVC devices.
    
    When transmitting data with PVC devices, the ndo_start_xmit function
    will prepend a header of 4 or 10 bytes. Currently this driver requests
    this headroom to be reserved for normal PVC devices by setting their
    hard_header_len to 10. However, this does not work when these devices
    are used with AF_PACKET/RAW sockets. Also, this driver does not request
    this headroom for Ethernet-emulating PVC devices (but deals with this
    problem by reallocating the skb when needed, which is not optimal).
    
    This patch replaces hard_header_len with needed_headroom, and set
    needed_headroom for Ethernet-emulating PVC devices, too. This makes
    the driver to request headroom for all PVC devices in all cases.

    resolve_btfids needs to be build as a host binary and it needs libbpf.
    However, libbpf Makefile hardcodes an include path utilizing $(ARCH).
    This results in mixing of cross-architecture headers resulting in a
    build failure.
    
    The specific header include path doesn't seem necessary for a libbpf
    build. Hence, remove the same.

    [ Upstream commit bc6717d55d07110d8f3c6d31ec2af50c11b07091 ]
    
    When the timer counts to the upper limit, an overflow interrupt is
    generated, and the count is reset with the value in the TIME_INI
    register. But the software expects to start counting from 0 when
    the count overflows, so it forces TIME_INI to 0 to solve the
    potential interrupt storm problem.

    drm/amdgpu: restore proper ref count in amdgpu_display_crtc_set_config
    
    commit a39d0d7bdf8c21ac7645c02e9676b5cb2b804c31 upstream.
    
    A recent attempt to fix a ref count leak in
    amdgpu_display_crtc_set_config() turned out to be doing too much and
    "fixed" an intended decrease as if it were a leak. Undo that part to
    restore the proper balance. This is the very nature of this function
    to increase or decrease the power reference count depending on the
    situation.
    
    Consequences of this bug is that the power reference would
    eventually get down to 0 while the display was still in use,
    resulting in that display switching off unexpectedly.

    ftrace: Move RCU is watching check after recursion check
    
    commit b40341fad6cc2daa195f8090fd3348f18fff640a upstream.
    
    The first thing that the ftrace function callback helper functions should do
    is to check for recursion. Peter Zijlstra found that when
    "rcu_is_watching()" had its notrace removed, it caused perf function tracing
    to crash. This is because the call of rcu_is_watching() is tested before
    function recursion is checked and and if it is traced, it will cause an
    infinite recursion loop.
    
    rcu_is_watching() should still stay notrace, but to prevent this should
    never had crashed in the first place. The recursion prevention must be the
    first thing done in callback functions.

    xfs: trim IO to found COW extent limit
    
    A bug existed in the XFS reflink code between v5.1 and v5.5 in which
    the mapping for a COW IO was not trimmed to the mapping of the COW
    extent that was found.  This resulted in a too-short copy, and
    corruption of other files which shared the original extent.
    
    (This happened only when extent size hints were set, which bypasses
    delalloc and led to this code path.)
    
    This was (inadvertently) fixed upstream with
    
    36adcbace24e "xfs: fill out the srcmap in iomap_begin"
    
    and related patches which moved lots of this functionality to
    the iomap subsystem.
    
    Hence, this is a -stable only patch, targeted to fix this
    corruption vector without other major code changes.

    net: virtio_vsock: Enhance connection semantics
    
    [ Upstream commit df12eb6d6cd920ab2f0e0a43cd6e1c23a05cea91 ]
    
    Whenever the vsock backend on the host sends a packet through the RX
    queue, it expects an answer on the TX queue. Unfortunately, there is one
    case where the host side will hang waiting for the answer and might
    effectively never recover if no timeout mechanism was implemented.
    
    This issue happens when the guest side starts binding to the socket,
    which insert a new bound socket into the list of already bound sockets.
    At this time, we expect the guest to also start listening, which will
    trigger the sk_state to move from TCP_CLOSE to TCP_LISTEN. The problem
    occurs if the host side queued a RX packet and triggered an interrupt
    right between the end of the binding process and the beginning of the
    listening process. In this specific case, the function processing the
    packet virtio_transport_recv_pkt() will find a bound socket, which means
    it will hit the switch statement checking for the sk_state, but the
    state won't be changed into TCP_LISTEN yet, which leads the code to pick
    the default statement. This default statement will only free the buffer,
    while it should also respond to the host side, by sending a packet on
    its TX queue.
    
    In order to simply fix this unfortunate chain of events, it is important
    that in case the default statement is entered, and because at this stage
    we know the host side is waiting for an answer, we must send back a
    packet containing the operation VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_RST.
    
    One could say that a proper timeout mechanism on the host side will be
    enough to avoid the backend to hang. But the point of this patch is to
    ensure the normal use case will be provided with proper responsiveness
    when it comes to establishing the connection.

    vsock/virtio: add transport parameter to the virtio_transport_reset_no_sock()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4c7246dc45e2706770d5233f7ce1597a07e069ba ]
    
    We are going to add 'struct vsock_sock *' parameter to
    virtio_transport_get_ops().
    
    In some cases, like in the virtio_transport_reset_no_sock(),
    we don't have any socket assigned to the packet received,
    so we can't use the virtio_transport_get_ops().
    
    In order to allow virtio_transport_reset_no_sock() to use the
    '.send_pkt' callback from the 'vhost_transport' or 'virtio_transport',
    we add the 'struct virtio_transport *' to it and to its caller:
    virtio_transport_recv_pkt().
    
    We moved the 'vhost_transport' and 'virtio_transport' definition,
    to pass their address to the virtio_transport_recv_pkt().

    USB: gadget: f_ncm: Fix NDP16 datagram validation
    
    commit 2b405533c2560d7878199c57d95a39151351df72 upstream.
    
    commit 2b74b0a04d3e ("USB: gadget: f_ncm: add bounds checks to ncm_unwrap_ntb()")
    adds important bounds checking however it unfortunately also introduces  a
    bug with respect to section 3.3.1 of the NCM specification.
    
    wDatagramIndex[1] : "Byte index, in little endian, of the second datagram
    described by this NDP16. If zero, then this marks the end of the sequence
    of datagrams in this NDP16."
    
    wDatagramLength[1]: "Byte length, in little endian, of the second datagram
    described by this NDP16. If zero, then this marks the end of the sequence
    of datagrams in this NDP16."
    
    wDatagramIndex[1] and wDatagramLength[1] respectively then may be zero but
    that does not mean we should throw away the data referenced by
    wDatagramIndex[0] and wDatagramLength[0] as is currently the case.
    
    Breaking the loop on (index2 == 0 || dg_len2 == 0) should come at the end
    as was previously the case and checks for index2 and dg_len2 should be
    removed since zero is valid.
    
    I'm not sure how much testing the above patch received but for me right now
    after enumeration ping doesn't work. Reverting the commit restores ping,
    scp, etc.
    
    The extra validation associated with wDatagramIndex[0] and
    wDatagramLength[0] appears to be valid so, this change removes the incorrect
    restriction on wDatagramIndex[1] and wDatagramLength[1] restoring data
    processing between host and device.

    mmc: sdhci: Workaround broken command queuing on Intel GLK based IRBIS models
    
    commit afd7f30886b0b445a4240a99020458a9772f2b89 upstream.
    
    Commit bedf9fc01ff1 ("mmc: sdhci: Workaround broken command queuing on
    Intel GLK"), disabled command-queuing on Intel GLK based LENOVO models
    because of it being broken due to what is believed to be a bug in
    the BIOS.
    
    It seems that the BIOS of some IRBIS models, including the IRBIS NB111
    model has the same issue, so disable command queuing there too.

    btrfs: fix filesystem corruption after a device replace
    
    commit 4c8f353272dd1262013873990c0fafd0e3c8f274 upstream.
    
    We use a device's allocation state tree to track ranges in a device used
    for allocated chunks, and we set ranges in this tree when allocating a new
    chunk. However after a device replace operation, we were not setting the
    allocated ranges in the new device's allocation state tree, so that tree
    is empty after a device replace.
    
    This means that a fitrim operation after a device replace will trim the
    device ranges that have allocated chunks and extents, as we trim every
    range for which there is not a range marked in the device's allocation
    state tree. It is also important during chunk allocation, since the
    device's allocation state is used to determine if a range is already
    allocated when allocating a new chunk.
    
    This is trivial to reproduce and the following script triggers the bug:
    
      $ cat reproducer.sh
      #!/bin/bash
    
      DEV1="/dev/sdg"
      DEV2="/dev/sdh"
      DEV3="/dev/sdi"
    
      wipefs -a $DEV1 $DEV2 $DEV3 &> /dev/null
    
      # Create a raid1 test fs on 2 devices.
      mkfs.btrfs -f -m raid1 -d raid1 $DEV1 $DEV2 > /dev/null
      mount $DEV1 /mnt/btrfs
    
      xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xab 0 10M" /mnt/btrfs/foo
    
      echo "Starting to replace $DEV1 with $DEV3"
      btrfs replace start -B $DEV1 $DEV3 /mnt/btrfs
      echo
    
      echo "Running fstrim"
      fstrim /mnt/btrfs
      echo
    
      echo "Unmounting filesystem"
      umount /mnt/btrfs
    
      echo "Mounting filesystem in degraded mode using $DEV3 only"
      wipefs -a $DEV1 $DEV2 &> /dev/null
      mount -o degraded $DEV3 /mnt/btrfs
      if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
              dmesg | tail
              echo
              echo "Failed to mount in degraded mode"
              exit 1
      fi
    
      echo
      echo "File foo data (expected all bytes = 0xab):"
      od -A d -t x1 /mnt/btrfs/foo
    
      umount /mnt/btrfs
    
    When running the reproducer:
    
      $ ./replace-test.sh
      wrote 10485760/10485760 bytes at offset 0
      10 MiB, 2560 ops; 0.0901 sec (110.877 MiB/sec and 28384.5216 ops/sec)

      mount: /mnt/btrfs: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdi, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.
      [19581.748641] BTRFS info (device sdg): dev_replace from /dev/sdg (devid 1) to /dev/sdi started

      Failed to mount in degraded mode
    
    So fix by setting all allocated ranges in the replace target device when
    the replace operation is finishing, when we are holding the chunk mutex
    and we can not race with new chunk allocations.
    
    A test case for fstests follows soon.
