    rxrpc: Fix service call disconnection
    
    [ Upstream commit b39a934ec72fa2b5a74123891f25273a38378b90 ]
    
    The recent patch that substituted a flag on an rxrpc_call for the
    connection pointer being NULL as an indication that a call was disconnected
    puts the set_bit in the wrong place for service calls.  This is only a
    problem if a call is implicitly terminated by a new call coming in on the
    same connection channel instead of a terminating ACK packet.
    
    In such a case, rxrpc_input_implicit_end_call() calls
    __rxrpc_disconnect_call(), which is now (incorrectly) setting the
    disconnection bit, meaning that when rxrpc_release_call() is later called,
    it doesn't call rxrpc_disconnect_call() and so the call isn't removed from
    the peer's error distribution list and the list gets corrupted.
    
    KASAN finds the issue as an access after release on a call, but the
    position at which it occurs is confusing as it appears to be related to a
    different call (the call site is where the latter call is being removed
    from the error distribution list and either the next or pprev pointer
    points to a previously released call).
    
    Fix this by moving the setting of the flag from __rxrpc_disconnect_call()
    to rxrpc_disconnect_call() in the same place that the connection pointer
    was being cleared.

    perf/core: Fix mlock accounting in perf_mmap()
    
    commit 003461559ef7a9bd0239bae35a22ad8924d6e9ad upstream.
    
    Decreasing sysctl_perf_event_mlock between two consecutive perf_mmap()s of
    a perf ring buffer may lead to an integer underflow in locked memory
    accounting. This may lead to the undesired behaviors, such as failures in
    BPF map creation.
    
    Address this by adjusting the accounting logic to take into account the
    possibility that the amount of already locked memory may exceed the
    current limit.

    clocksource: Prevent double add_timer_on() for watchdog_timer
    
    commit febac332a819f0e764aa4da62757ba21d18c182b upstream.
    
    Kernel crashes inside QEMU/KVM are observed:
    
      kernel BUG at kernel/time/timer.c:1154!
      BUG_ON(timer_pending(timer) || !timer->function) in add_timer_on().
    
    At the same time another cpu got:
    
      general protection fault: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI of poinson pointer 0xdead000000000200 in:

    Unfortunately kernel logs are badly scrambled, stacktraces are lost.
    
    Printing the timer->function before the BUG_ON() pointed to
    clocksource_watchdog().
    
    The execution of clocksource_watchdog() can race with a sequence of
    clocksource_stop_watchdog() .. clocksource_start_watchdog():

       BUG_ON(timer_pending(timer) || !timer->function);
        timer_pending() -> true
        BUG()
    
    I.e. inside clocksource_watchdog() watchdog_timer could be already armed.
    
    Check timer_pending() before calling add_timer_on(). This is sufficient as
    all operations are synchronized by watchdog_lock.

    x86/apic/msi: Plug non-maskable MSI affinity race
    
    commit 6f1a4891a5928a5969c87fa5a584844c983ec823 upstream.
    
    Evan tracked down a subtle race between the update of the MSI message and
    the device raising an interrupt internally on PCI devices which do not
    support MSI masking. The update of the MSI message is non-atomic and
    consists of either 2 or 3 sequential 32bit wide writes to the PCI config
    space.
    
       - Write address low 32bits
       - Write address high 32bits (If supported by device)
       - Write data
    
    When an interrupt is migrated then both address and data might change, so
    the kernel attempts to mask the MSI interrupt first. But for MSI masking is
    optional, so there exist devices which do not provide it. That means that
    if the device raises an interrupt internally between the writes then a MSI
    message is sent built from half updated state.
    
    On x86 this can lead to spurious interrupts on the wrong interrupt
    vector when the affinity setting changes both address and data. As a
    consequence the device interrupt can be lost causing the device to
    become stuck or malfunctioning.
    
    Evan tried to handle that by disabling MSI accross an MSI message
    update. That's not feasible because disabling MSI has issues on its own:
    
     If MSI is disabled the PCI device is routing an interrupt to the legacy
     INTx mechanism. The INTx delivery can be disabled, but the disablement is
     not working on all devices.
    
     Some devices lose interrupts when both MSI and INTx delivery are disabled.
    
    Another way to solve this would be to enforce the allocation of the same
    vector on all CPUs in the system for this kind of screwed devices. That
    could be done, but it would bring back the vector space exhaustion problems
    which got solved a few years ago.
    
    Fortunately the high address (if supported by the device) is only relevant
    when X2APIC is enabled which implies interrupt remapping. In the interrupt
    remapping case the affinity setting is happening at the interrupt remapping
    unit and the PCI MSI message is programmed only once when the PCI device is
    initialized.
    
    That makes it possible to solve it with a two step update:
    
      1) Target the MSI msg to the new vector on the current target CPU
    
      2) Target the MSI msg to the new vector on the new target CPU
    
    In both cases writing the MSI message is only changing a single 32bit word
    which prevents the issue of inconsistency.
    
    After writing the final destination it is necessary to check whether the
    device issued an interrupt while the intermediate state #1 (new vector,
    current CPU) was in effect.
    
    This is possible because the affinity change is always happening on the
    current target CPU. The code runs with interrupts disabled, so the
    interrupt can be detected by checking the IRR of the local APIC. If the
    vector is pending in the IRR then the interrupt is retriggered on the new
    target CPU by sending an IPI for the associated vector on the target CPU.
    
    This can cause spurious interrupts on both the local and the new target
    CPU.
    
     1) If the new vector is not in use on the local CPU and the device
        affected by the affinity change raised an interrupt during the
        transitional state (step #1 above) then interrupt entry code will
        ignore that spurious interrupt. The vector is marked so that the
        'No irq handler for vector' warning is supressed once.
    
     2) If the new vector is in use already on the local CPU then the IRR check
        might see an pending interrupt from the device which is using this
        vector. The IPI to the new target CPU will then invoke the handler of
        the device, which got the affinity change, even if that device did not
        issue an interrupt
    
     3) If the new vector is in use already on the local CPU and the device
        affected by the affinity change raised an interrupt during the
        transitional state (step #1 above) then the handler of the device which
        uses that vector on the local CPU will be invoked.
    
    expose issues in device driver interrupt handlers which are not prepared to
    handle a spurious interrupt correctly. This not a regression, it's just
    exposing something which was already broken as spurious interrupts can
    happen for a lot of reasons and all driver handlers need to be able to deal
    with them.

    KVM: Play nice with read-only memslots when querying host page size
    
    [ Upstream commit 42cde48b2d39772dba47e680781a32a6c4b7dc33 ]
    
    Avoid the "writable" check in __gfn_to_hva_many(), which will always fail
    on read-only memslots due to gfn_to_hva() assuming writes.  Functionally,
    this allows x86 to create large mappings for read-only memslots that
    are backed by HugeTLB mappings.
    
    Note, the changelog for commit 05da45583de9 ("KVM: MMU: large page
    support") states "If the largepage contains write-protected pages, a
    large pte is not used.", but "write-protected" refers to pages that are
    temporarily read-only, e.g. read-only memslots didn't even exist at the
    time.

    KVM: x86: fix overlap between SPTE_MMIO_MASK and generation
    
    [ Upstream commit 56871d444bc4d7ea66708775e62e2e0926384dbc ]
    
    The SPTE_MMIO_MASK overlaps with the bits used to track MMIO
    generation number.  A high enough generation number would overwrite the
    SPTE_SPECIAL_MASK region and cause the MMIO SPTE to be misinterpreted.
    
    Likewise, setting bits 52 and 53 would also cause an incorrect generation
    number to be read from the PTE, though this was partially mitigated by the
    (useless if it weren't for the bug) removal of SPTE_SPECIAL_MASK from
    the spte in get_mmio_spte_generation.  Drop that removal, and replace
    it with a compile-time assertion.

    KVM: x86: Use gpa_t for cr2/gpa to fix TDP support on 32-bit KVM
    
    [ Upstream commit 736c291c9f36b07f8889c61764c28edce20e715d ]
    
    Convert a plethora of parameters and variables in the MMU and page fault
    flows from type gva_t to gpa_t to properly handle TDP on 32-bit KVM.
    
    Thanks to PSE and PAE paging, 32-bit kernels can access 64-bit physical
    addresses.  When TDP is enabled, the fault address is a guest physical
    address and thus can be a 64-bit value, even when both KVM and its guest
    are using 32-bit virtual addressing, e.g. VMX's VMCS.GUEST_PHYSICAL is a
    64-bit field, not a natural width field.
    
    Using a gva_t for the fault address means KVM will incorrectly drop the
    upper 32-bits of the GPA.  Ditto for gva_to_gpa() when it is used to
    translate L2 GPAs to L1 GPAs.
    
    Opportunistically rename variables and parameters to better reflect the
    dual address modes, e.g. use "cr2_or_gpa" for fault addresses and plain
    "addr" instead of "vaddr" when the address may be either a GVA or an L2
    GPA.  Similarly, use "gpa" in the nonpaging_page_fault() flows to avoid
    a confusing "gpa_t gva" declaration; this also sets the stage for a
    future patch to combing nonpaging_page_fault() and tdp_page_fault() with
    minimal churn.
    
    Sprinkle in a few comments to document flows where an address is known
    to be a GVA and thus can be safely truncated to a 32-bit value.  Add
    WARNs in kvm_handle_page_fault() and FNAME(gva_to_gpa_nested)() to help
    document such cases and detect bugs.

    KVM: x86/mmu: Apply max PA check for MMIO sptes to 32-bit KVM
    
    [ Upstream commit e30a7d623dccdb3f880fbcad980b0cb589a1da45 ]
    
    Remove the bogus 64-bit only condition from the check that disables MMIO
    spte optimization when the system supports the max PA, i.e. doesn't have
    any reserved PA bits.  32-bit KVM always uses PAE paging for the shadow
    MMU, and per Intel's SDM:
    
      PAE paging translates 32-bit linear addresses to 52-bit physical
      addresses.
    
    The kernel's restrictions on max physical addresses are limits on how
    much memory the kernel can reasonably use, not what physical addresses
    are supported by hardware.

    drm/dp_mst: Remove VCPI while disabling topology mgr
    
    [ Upstream commit 64e62bdf04ab8529f45ed0a85122c703035dec3a ]
    
    [Why]
    
    This patch is trying to address the issue observed when hotplug DP
    daisy chain monitors.
    
    e.g.
    src-mstb-mstb-sst -> src (unplug) mstb-mstb-sst -> src-mstb-mstb-sst
    (plug in again)
    
    Once unplug a DP MST capable device, driver will call
    drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst() to disable MST. In this function,
    it cleans data of topology manager while disabling mst_state. However,
    it doesn't clean up the proposed_vcpis of topology manager.
    If proposed_vcpi is not reset, once plug in MST daisy chain monitors
    later, code will fail at checking port validation while trying to
    allocate payloads.
    
    When MST capable device is plugged in again and try to allocate
    payloads by calling drm_dp_update_payload_part1(), this
    function will iterate over all proposed virtual channels to see if
    any proposed VCPI's num_slots is greater than 0. If any proposed
    VCPI's num_slots is greater than 0 and the port which the
    specific virtual channel directed to is not in the topology, code then
    fails at the port validation. Since there are stale VCPI allocations
    from the previous topology enablement in proposed_vcpi[], code will fail
    at port validation and reurn EINVAL.
    
    [How]
    
    Clean up the data of stale proposed_vcpi[] and reset mgr->proposed_vcpis
    to NULL while disabling mst in drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst().

    btrfs: free block groups after free'ing fs trees
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e19443da1941050b346f8fc4c368aa68413bc88 ]
    
    Sometimes when running generic/475 we would trip the
    WARN_ON(cache->reserved) check when free'ing the block groups on umount.
    This is because sometimes we don't commit the transaction because of IO
    errors and thus do not cleanup the tree logs until at umount time.
    
    These blocks are still reserved until they are cleaned up, but they
    aren't cleaned up until _after_ we do the free block groups work.  Fix
    this by moving the free after free'ing the fs roots, that way all of the
    tree logs are cleaned up and we have a properly cleaned fs.  A bunch of
    loops of generic/475 confirmed this fixes the problem.

    x86/timer: Don't skip PIT setup when APIC is disabled or in legacy mode
    
    commit 979923871f69a4dc926658f9f9a1a4c1bde57552 upstream.
    
    Tony reported a boot regression caused by the recent workaround for systems
    which have a disabled (clock gate off) PIT.
    
    On his machine the kernel fails to initialize the PIT because
    apic_needs_pit() does not take into account whether the local APIC
    interrupt delivery mode will actually allow to setup and use the local
    APIC timer. This should be easy to reproduce with acpi=off on the
    command line which also disables HPET.
    
    Due to the way the PIT/HPET and APIC setup ordering works (APIC setup can
    require working PIT/HPET) the information is not available at the point
    where apic_needs_pit() makes this decision.
    
    To address this, split out the interrupt mode selection from
    apic_intr_mode_init(), invoke the selection before making the decision
    whether PIT is required or not, and add the missing checks into
    apic_needs_pit().

    net/mlx5: Fix deadlock in fs_core
    
    [ Upstream commit c1948390d78b5183ee9b7dd831efd7f6ac496ab0 ]
    
    free_match_list could be called when the flow table is already
    locked. We need to pass this notation to tree_put_node.
    
    It fixes the following lockdep warnning:

    drop_monitor: Do not cancel uninitialized work item
    
    [ Upstream commit dfa7f709596be5ca46c070d4f8acbb344322056a ]
    
    Drop monitor uses a work item that takes care of constructing and
    sending netlink notifications to user space. In case drop monitor never
    started to monitor, then the work item is uninitialized and not
    associated with a function.
    
    Therefore, a stop command from user space results in canceling an
    uninitialized work item which leads to the following warning [1].
    
    Fix this by not processing a stop command if drop monitor is not
    currently monitoring.

    ipv6/addrconf: fix potential NULL deref in inet6_set_link_af()
    
    [ Upstream commit db3fa271022dacb9f741b96ea4714461a8911bb9 ]
    
    __in6_dev_get(dev) called from inet6_set_link_af() can return NULL.
    
    The needed check has been recently removed, let's add it back.
    
    While do_setlink() does call validate_linkmsg() :
    ...
    err = validate_linkmsg(dev, tb); /* OK at this point */
    ...
    
    It is possible that the following call happening before the
    ->set_link_af() removes IPv6 if MTU is less than 1280 :
    
    if (tb[IFLA_MTU]) {
        err = dev_set_mtu_ext(dev, nla_get_u32(tb[IFLA_MTU]), extack);
        if (err < 0)
              goto errout;
        status |= DO_SETLINK_MODIFIED;
    }
    ...
    
    if (tb[IFLA_AF_SPEC]) {
       ...
       err = af_ops->set_link_af(dev, af);
          ->inet6_set_link_af() // CRASH because idev is NULL
    
    Please note that IPv4 is immune to the bug since inet_set_link_af() does :
    
    struct in_device *in_dev = __in_dev_get_rcu(dev);
    if (!in_dev)
        return -EAFNOSUPPORT;
    
    This problem has been mentioned in commit cf7afbfeb8ce ("rtnl: make
    link af-specific updates atomic") changelog :
    
        This method is not fail proof, while it is currently sufficient
        to make set_link_af() inerrable and thus 100% atomic, the

    taprio: Fix dropping packets when using taprio + ETF offloading
    
    [ Upstream commit bfabd41da34180d05382312533a3adc2e012dee0 ]
    
    When using taprio offloading together with ETF offloading, configured
    like this, for example:
    
    $ tc qdisc replace dev $IFACE parent root handle 100 taprio \
            num_tc 4 \
            map 2 2 1 0 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 \
            queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 \
            base-time $BASE_TIME \
            sched-entry S 01 1000000 \
            sched-entry S 0e 1000000 \
            flags 0x2
    
    $ tc qdisc replace dev $IFACE parent 100:1 etf \
            offload delta 300000 clockid CLOCK_TAI
    
    During enqueue, it works out that the verification added for the
    "txtime" assisted mode is run when using taprio + ETF offloading, the
    only thing missing is initializing the 'next_txtime' of all the cycle
    entries. (if we don't set 'next_txtime' all packets from SO_TXTIME
    sockets are dropped)

    taprio: Use taprio_reset_tc() to reset Traffic Classes configuration
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c16680a08ee1e444a67d232c679ccf5b30fad16 ]
    
    When destroying the current taprio instance, which can happen when the
    creation of one fails, we should reset the traffic class configuration
    back to the default state.
    
    netdev_reset_tc() is a better way because in addition to setting the
    number of traffic classes to zero, it also resets the priority to
    traffic classes mapping to the default value.

    taprio: Fix still allowing changing the flags during runtime
    
    [ Upstream commit a9d6227436f32142209f4428f2dc616761485112 ]
    
    Because 'q->flags' starts as zero, and zero is a valid value, we
    aren't able to detect the transition from zero to something else
    during "runtime".
    
    The solution is to initialize 'q->flags' with an invalid value, so we
    can detect if 'q->flags' was set by the user or not.
    
    To better solidify the behavior, 'flags' handling is moved to a
    separate function. The behavior is:
     - 'flags' if unspecified by the user, is assumed to be zero;
     - 'flags' cannot change during "runtime" (i.e. a change() request
     cannot modify it);
    
    With this new function we can remove taprio_flags, which should reduce
    the risk of future accidents.
    
    Allowing flags to be changed was causing the following RCU stall:

    taprio: Fix enabling offload with wrong number of traffic classes
    
    [ Upstream commit 5652e63df3303c2a702bac25fbf710b9cb64dfba ]
    
    If the driver implementing taprio offloading depends on the value of
    the network device number of traffic classes (dev->num_tc) for
    whatever reason, it was going to receive the value zero. The value was
    only set after the offloading function is called.
    
    So, moving setting the number of traffic classes to before the
    offloading function is called fixes this issue. This is safe because
    this only happens when taprio is instantiated (we don't allow this
    configuration to be changed without first removing taprio).

    net: macb: Limit maximum GEM TX length in TSO
    
    [ Upstream commit f822e9c4ffa511a5c681cf866287d9383a3b6f1b ]
    
    GEM_MAX_TX_LEN currently resolves to 0x3FF8 for any IP version supporting
    TSO with full 14bits of length field in payload descriptor. But an IP
    errata causes false amba_error (bit 6 of ISR) when length in payload
    descriptors is specified above 16387. The error occurs because the DMA
    falsely concludes that there is not enough space in SRAM for incoming
    payload. These errors were observed continuously under stress of large
    packets using iperf on a version where SRAM was 16K for each queue. This
    errata will be documented shortly and affects all versions since TSO
    functionality was added. Hence limit the max length to 0x3FC0 (rounded).

    The IP TSO implementation does NOT require the length to be a

    dpaa_eth: support all modes with rate adapting PHYs
    
    [ Upstream commit 73a21fa817f0cc8022dc6226250a86bca727a56d ]
    
    Stop removing modes that are not supported on the system interface
    when the connected PHY is capable of rate adaptation. This addresses
    an issue with the LS1046ARDB board 10G interface no longer working
    with an 1G link partner after autonegotiation support was added
    for the Aquantia PHY on board in
    
    commit 09c4c57f7bc4 ("net: phy: aquantia: add support for auto-negotiation configuration")
    
    Before this commit the values advertised by the PHY were not
    influenced by the dpaa_eth driver removal of system-side unsupported
    modes as the aqr_config_aneg() was basically a no-op. After this
    commit, the modes removed by the dpaa_eth driver were no longer
    advertised thus autonegotiation with 1G link partners failed.

    devlink: report 0 after hitting end in region read
    
    [ Upstream commit d5b90e99e1d51b7b5d2b74fbc4c2db236a510913 ]
    
    commit fdd41ec21e15 ("devlink: Return right error code in case of errors
    for region read") modified the region read code to report errors
    properly in unexpected cases.
    
    In the case where the start_offset and ret_offset match, it unilaterally
    converted this into an error. This causes an issue for the "dump"
    version of the command. In this case, the devlink region dump will
    always report an invalid argument:
    
    000000000000ffd0 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
    000000000000ffe0 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
    devlink answers: Invalid argument
    000000000000fff0 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
    
    This occurs because the expected flow for the dump is to return 0 after
    there is no further data.
    
    The simplest fix would be to stop converting the error code to -EINVAL
    if start_offset == ret_offset. However, avoid unnecessary work by
    checking for when start_offset is larger than the region size and
    returning 0 upfront.

    bonding/alb: properly access headers in bond_alb_xmit()
    
    [ Upstream commit 38f88c45404293bbc027b956def6c10cbd45c616 ]
    
    syzbot managed to send an IPX packet through bond_alb_xmit()
    and af_packet and triggered a use-after-free.
    
    First, bond_alb_xmit() was using ipx_hdr() helper to reach
    the IPX header, but ipx_hdr() was using the transport offset
    instead of the network offset. In the particular syzbot
    report transport offset was 0xFFFF
    
    This patch removes ipx_hdr() since it was only (mis)used from bonding.
    
    Then we need to make sure IPv4/IPv6/IPX headers are pulled
    in skb->head before dereferencing anything.

    Comparing the voltage of VDDA and VDDIO to determine whether or not to
    enable VDDC manual override is insufficient. This is a problem in case
    the VDDA is supplied from different regulator than VDDIO, while both
    report the same voltage to the regulator framework. In that case where
    VDDA and VDDIO is supplied by different regulators, the VDDC manual
    override must not be applied.

    regulator: core: Add regulator_is_equal() helper
    
    commit b059b7e0ec3208ff1e17cff6387d75a9fbab4e02 upstream.
    
    Add regulator_is_equal() helper to compare whether two regulators are
    the same. This is useful for checking whether two separate regulators
    in a driver are actually the same supply.

    ubifs: Fix memory leak from c->sup_node
    
    commit ff90bdfb206e49c8b418811efbdd0c77380fa8c2 upstream.
    
    The c->sup_node is allocated in function ubifs_read_sb_node but
    is not freed. This will cause memory leak as below:

    ubi: Fix an error pointer dereference in error handling code
    
    commit 5d3805af279c93ef49a64701f35254676d709622 upstream.
    
    If "seen_pebs = init_seen(ubi);" fails then "seen_pebs" is an error pointer
    and we try to kfree() it which results in an Oops.
    
    This patch re-arranges the error handling so now it only frees things
    which have been allocated successfully.

    commit ef5aafb6e4e9942a28cd300bdcda21ce6cbaf045 upstream.
    
    set_seen() sets the bit corresponding to the PEB number in the bitmap,
    so when self_check_seen() wants to find PEBs that haven't been seen we
    have to print the PEBs that have their bit cleared, not the ones which
    have it set.

    nfsd: fix jiffies/time_t mixup in LRU list
    
    commit 9594497f2c78993cb66b696122f7c65528ace985 upstream.
    
    The nfsd4_blocked_lock->nbl_time timestamp is recorded in jiffies,
    but then compared to a CLOCK_REALTIME timestamp later on, which makes
    no sense.
    
    For consistency with the other timestamps, change this to use a time_t.
    
    This is a change in behavior, which may cause regressions, but the
    current code is not sensible. On a system with CONFIG_HZ=1000,
    the 'time_after((unsigned long)nbl->nbl_time, (unsigned long)cutoff))'
    check is false for roughly the first 18 days of uptime and then true
    for the next 49 days.

    nfsd: fix delay timer on 32-bit architectures
    
    commit 2561c92b12f4f4e386d453556685f75775c0938b upstream.
    
    The nfsd4_cb_layout_done() function takes a 'time_t' value,
    multiplied by NSEC_PER_SEC*2 to get a nanosecond value.
    
    This works fine on 64-bit architectures, but on 32-bit, any
    value over 1 second results in a signed integer overflow
    with unexpected results.
    
    Cast one input to a 64-bit type in order to produce the
    same result that we have on 64-bit architectures, regarless
    of the type of nfsd4_lease.

    Commit b0ffeb537f3a ("IB/mlx5: Fix iteration overrun in GSI qps") changed
    the way outstanding WRs are tracked for the GSI QP. But the fix did not
    cover the case when a call to ib_post_send() fails and updates index to
    track outstanding.
    
    Since the prior commmit outstanding_pi should not be bounded otherwise the
    loop generate_completions() will fail.

    mt25q family is different from n25q family of devices, even though manf
    ID and device IDs are same. mt25q flash has bit 6 set in 5th byte of
    READ ID response which can be used to distinguish it from n25q variant.
    mt25q flashes support stateless 4 Byte addressing opcodes where as n25q
    flashes don't. Therefore, have two separate entries for mt25qu512a and
    n25q512a.

    ASoC: meson: axg-fifo: fix fifo threshold setup
    
    commit 864cee90d4bd870e5d5e5a0b1a6f055f4f951350 upstream.
    
    On TODDR sm1, the fifo threshold register field is slightly different
    compared to the other SoCs. This leads to the fifo A being flushed to
    memory every 8kB. If the period is smaller than that, several periods
    are pushed to memory and notified at once. This is not ideal.
    
    Fix the register field update. With this, the fifos are flushed every
    128B. We could still do better, like adapt the threshold depending on
    the period size, but at least it consistent across the different
    SoC/fifos

    broken ping to ipv6 linklocal addresses on debian buster
    
    commit 87fbfffcc89b92a4281b0aa53bd06af714087889 upstream.
    
    I am seeing ping failures to IPv6 linklocal addresses with Debian
    buster. Easiest example to reproduce is:
    
    $ ping -c1 -w1 ff02::1%eth1
    connect: Invalid argument
    
    $ ping -c1 -w1 ff02::1%eth1
    PING ff02::01%eth1(ff02::1%eth1) 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from fe80::e0:f9ff:fe0c:37%eth1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.059 ms
    
    git bisect traced the failure to
    commit b9ef5513c99b ("smack: Check address length before reading address family")
    
    Arguably ping is being stupid since the buster version is not setting
    the address family properly (ping on stretch for example does):
    
    $ strace -e connect ping6 -c1 -w1 ff02::1%eth1
    connect(5, {sa_family=AF_UNSPEC,
    sa_data="\4\1\0\0\0\0\377\2\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\1\3\0\0\0"}, 28)
    = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
    
    but the command works fine on kernels prior to this commit, so this is
    breakage which goes against the Linux paradigm of "don't break userspace"

    fix up iter on short count in fuse_direct_io()
    
    commit f658adeea45e430a24c7a157c3d5448925ac2038 upstream.
    
    fuse_direct_io() can end up advancing the iterator by more than the amount
    of data read or written.  This case is handled by the generic code if going
    through ->direct_IO(), but not in the FOPEN_DIRECT_IO case.
    
    Fix by reverting the extra bytes from the iterator in case of error or a
    short count.
    
    To test: install lxcfs, then the following testcase
      int fd = open("/var/lib/lxcfs/proc/uptime", O_RDONLY);
      sendfile(1, fd, NULL, 16777216);
      sendfile(1, fd, NULL, 16777216);
    will spew WARN_ON() in iov_iter_pipe().

    virtio-pci: check name when counting MSI-X vectors
    
    commit 303090b513fd1ee45aa1536b71a3838dc054bc05 upstream.
    
    VQs without a name specified are not valid; they are skipped in the
    later loop that assigns MSI-X vectors to queues, but the per_vq_vectors
    loop above that counts the required number of vectors previously still
    counted any queue with a non-NULL callback as needing a vector.
    
    Add a check to the per_vq_vectors loop so that vectors with no name are
    not counted to make the two loops consistent.  This prevents
    over-counting unnecessary vectors (e.g. for features which were not
    negotiated with the device).

    commit 5790b53390e18fdd21e70776e46d058c05eda2f2 upstream.
    
    Ensure that elements of the callbacks array that correspond to
    unavailable features are set to NULL; previously, they would be left
    uninitialized.
    
    Since the corresponding names array elements were explicitly set to
    NULL, the uninitialized callback pointers would not actually be
    dereferenced; however, the uninitialized callbacks elements would still
    be read in vp_find_vqs_msix() and used to calculate the number of MSI-X
    vectors required.

    drm/amd/dm/mst: Ignore payload update failures
    
    commit 58fe03d6dec908a1bec07eea7e94907af5c07eec upstream.
    
    Disabling a display on MST can potentially happen after the entire MST
    topology has been removed, which means that we can't communicate with
    the topology at all in this scenario. Likewise, this also means that we
    can't properly update payloads on the topology and as such, it's a good
    idea to ignore payload update failures when disabling displays.
    Currently, amdgpu makes the mistake of halting the payload update
    process when any payload update failures occur, resulting in leaving
    DC's local copies of the payload tables out of date.
    
    This ends up causing problems with hotplugging MST topologies, and
    causes modesets on the second hotplug to fail like so:

    clk: tegra: Mark fuse clock as critical
    
    commit bf83b96f87ae2abb1e535306ea53608e8de5dfbb upstream.
    
    For a little over a year, U-Boot on Tegra124 has configured the flow
    controller to perform automatic RAM re-repair on off->on power
    transitions of the CPU rail[1]. This is mandatory for correct operation
    of Tegra124. However, RAM re-repair relies on certain clocks, which the
    kernel must enable and leave running. The fuse clock is one of those
    clocks. Mark this clock as critical so that LP1 power mode (system
    suspend) operates correctly.

    mm/mmu_gather: invalidate TLB correctly on batch allocation failure and flush
    
    commit 0ed1325967ab5f7a4549a2641c6ebe115f76e228 upstream.
    
    Architectures for which we have hardware walkers of Linux page table
    should flush TLB on mmu gather batch allocation failures and batch flush.
    Some architectures like POWER supports multiple translation modes (hash
    and radix) and in the case of POWER only radix translation mode needs the
    above TLBI.  This is because for hash translation mode kernel wants to
    avoid this extra flush since there are no hardware walkers of linux page
    table.  With radix translation, the hardware also walks linux page table
    and with that, kernel needs to make sure to TLB invalidate page walk cache
    before page table pages are freed.
    
    More details in commit d86564a2f085 ("mm/tlb, x86/mm: Support invalidating
    TLB caches for RCU_TABLE_FREE")
    
    The changes to sparc are to make sure we keep the old behavior since we
    are now removing HAVE_RCU_TABLE_NO_INVALIDATE.  The default value for
    tlb_needs_table_invalidate is to always force an invalidate and sparc can
    avoid the table invalidate.  Hence we define tlb_needs_table_invalidate to
    false for sparc architecture.

    arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404-evb: Set vdd_apc regulator in high power mode
    
    commit eac8ce86cb90ba96cb4bcbf2549d7a8b6938aa30 upstream.
    
    vdd_apc is the regulator that supplies the main CPU cluster.
    
    At sudden CPU load changes, we have noticed invalid page faults on
    addresses with all bits shifted, as well as on addresses with individual
    bits flipped.
    
    By putting the vdd_apc regulator in high power mode, the voltage drops
    during sudden load changes will be less severe, and we have not been able
    to reproduce the invalid page faults with the regulator in this mode.

    mm/page_alloc.c: fix uninitialized memmaps on a partially populated last section
    
    commit e822969cab48b786b64246aad1a3ba2a774f5d23 upstream.
    
    Patch series "mm: fix max_pfn not falling on section boundary", v2.
    
    Playing with different memory sizes for a x86-64 guest, I discovered that
    some memmaps (highest section if max_mem does not fall on the section
    boundary) are marked as being valid and online, but contain garbage.  We
    have to properly initialize these memmaps.
    
    Looking at /proc/kpageflags and friends, I found some more issues,
    partially related to this.
    
    This patch (of 3):
    
    If max_pfn is not aligned to a section boundary, we can easily run into
    BUGs.  This can e.g., be triggered on x86-64 under QEMU by specifying a
    memory size that is not a multiple of 128MB (e.g., 4097MB, but also
    4160MB).  I was told that on real HW, we can easily have this scenario
    (esp., one of the main reasons sub-section hotadd of devmem was added).
    
    The issue is, that we have a valid memmap (pfn_valid()) for the whole
    section, and the whole section will be marked "online".
    pfn_to_online_page() will succeed, but the memmap contains garbage.
    
    E.g., doing a "./page-types -r -a 0x144001" when QEMU was started with "-m
    4160M" - (see tools/vm/page-types.c):

    This patch fixes that by at least zero-ing out that memmap (so e.g.,
    page_to_pfn() will not crash).  Commit 907ec5fca3dc ("mm: zero remaining
    unavailable struct pages") tried to fix a similar issue, but forgot to
    consider this special case.
    
    After this patch, there are still problems to solve.  E.g., not all of
    these pages falling into a memory hole will actually get initialized later
    and set PageReserved - they are only zeroed out - but at least the
    immediate crashes are gone.  A follow-up patch will take care of this.

    ocfs2: fix oops when writing cloned file
    
    commit 2d797e9ff95ecbcf0a83d657928ed20579444857 upstream.
    
    Writing a cloned file triggers a kernel oops and the user-space command
    process is also killed by the system.  The bug can be reproduced stably
    via:
    
    1) create a file under ocfs2 file system directory.
    
      journalctl -b > aa.txt
    
    2) create a cloned file for this file.
    
      reflink aa.txt bb.txt
    
    3) write the cloned file with dd command.
    
      dd if=/dev/zero of=bb.txt bs=512 count=1 conv=notrunc

    KVM: s390: do not clobber registers during guest reset/store status
    
    commit 55680890ea78be0df5e1384989f1be835043c084 upstream.
    
    The initial CPU reset clobbers the userspace fpc and the store status
    ioctl clobbers the guest acrs + fpr.  As these calls are only done via
    ioctl (and not via vcpu_run), no CPU context is loaded, so we can (and
    must) act directly on the sync regs, not on the thread context.

    KVM: x86: Revert "KVM: X86: Fix fpu state crash in kvm guest"
    
    commit 2620fe268e80d667a94553cd37a94ccaa2cb8c83 upstream.
    
    Reload the current thread's FPU state, which contains the guest's FPU
    state, to the CPU registers if necessary during vcpu_enter_guest().
    TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD can be set any time control is transferred out of KVM,
    e.g. if I/O is triggered during a KVM call to get_user_pages() or if a
    softirq occurs while KVM is scheduled in.
    
    Moving the handling of TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD from vcpu_enter_guest() to
    kvm_arch_vcpu_load(), effectively kvm_sched_in(), papered over a bug
    where kvm_put_guest_fpu() failed to account for TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD.  The
    easiest way to the kvm_put_guest_fpu() bug was to run with involuntary
    preemption enable, thus handling TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD during kvm_sched_in()
    made the bug go away.  But, removing the handling in vcpu_enter_guest()
    exposed KVM to the rare case of a softirq triggering kernel_fpu_begin()
    between vcpu_load() and vcpu_enter_guest().
    
    Now that kvm_{load,put}_guest_fpu() correctly handle TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD,
    revert the commit to both restore the vcpu_enter_guest() behavior and
    eliminate the superfluous switch_fpu_return() in kvm_arch_vcpu_load().
    
    Note, leaving the handling in kvm_arch_vcpu_load() isn't wrong per se,
    but it is unnecessary, and most critically, makes it extremely difficult
    to find bugs such as the kvm_put_guest_fpu() issue due to shrinking the
    window where a softirq can corrupt state.
    
    A sample trace triggered by warning if TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD is set while
    vcpu state is loaded:

    KVM: x86: Ensure guest's FPU state is loaded when accessing for emulation
    
    commit a7baead7e312f5a05381d68585fb6dc68e19e90f upstream.
    
    Lock the FPU regs and reload the current thread's FPU state, which holds
    the guest's FPU state, to the CPU registers if necessary prior to
    accessing guest FPU state as part of emulation.  kernel_fpu_begin() can
    be called from softirq context, therefore KVM must ensure softirqs are
    disabled (locking the FPU regs disables softirqs) when touching CPU FPU
    state.
    
    Note, for all intents and purposes this reverts commit 6ab0b9feb82a7
    ("x86,kvm: remove KVM emulator get_fpu / put_fpu"), but at the time it
    was applied, removing get/put_fpu() was correct.  The re-introduction
    of {get,put}_fpu() is necessitated by the deferring of FPU state load.

    commit c9aef3b85f425d1f6635382ec210ee5a7ef55d7d upstream.
    
    Handle TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD similar to how fpu__copy() handles the flag
    when duplicating FPU state to a new task struct.  TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD can
    be set any time control is transferred out of KVM, be it voluntarily,
    e.g. if I/O is triggered during a KVM call to get_user_pages, or
    involuntarily, e.g. if softirq runs after an IRQ occurs.  Therefore,
    KVM must account for TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD whenever it is (potentially)
    accessing CPU FPU state.

    KVM: x86: Free wbinvd_dirty_mask if vCPU creation fails
    
    commit 16be9ddea268ad841457a59109963fff8c9de38d upstream.
    
    Free the vCPU's wbinvd_dirty_mask if vCPU creation fails after
    kvm_arch_vcpu_init(), e.g. when installing the vCPU's file descriptor.
    Do the freeing by calling kvm_arch_vcpu_free() instead of open coding
    the freeing.  This adds a likely superfluous, but ultimately harmless,
    call to kvmclock_reset(), which only clears vcpu->arch.pv_time_enabled.
    Using kvm_arch_vcpu_free() allows for additional cleanup in the future.

    KVM: x86: Don't let userspace set host-reserved cr4 bits
    
    commit b11306b53b2540c6ba068c4deddb6a17d9f8d95b upstream.
    
    Calculate the host-reserved cr4 bits at runtime based on the system's
    capabilities (using logic similar to __do_cpuid_func()), and use the
    dynamically generated mask for the reserved bit check in kvm_set_cr4()
    instead using of the static CR4_RESERVED_BITS define.  This prevents
    userspace from "enabling" features in cr4 that are not supported by the
    system, e.g. by ignoring KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID and specifying a bogus
    CPUID for the vCPU.
    
    Allowing userspace to set unsupported bits in cr4 can lead to a variety
    of undesirable behavior, e.g. failed VM-Enter, and in general increases
    KVM's attack surface.  A crafty userspace can even abuse CR4.LA57 to
    induce an unchecked #GP on a WRMSR.
    
    On a platform without LA57 support:
    
      KVM_SET_CPUID2 // CPUID_7_0_ECX.LA57 = 1
      KVM_SET_SREGS  // CR4.LA57 = 1
      KVM_SET_MSRS   // KERNEL_GS_BASE = 0x0004000000000000
      KVM_RUN
    
    leads to a #GP when writing KERNEL_GS_BASE into hardware:
    
      unchecked MSR access error: WRMSR to 0xc0000102 (tried to write 0x0004000000000000)
      at rIP: 0xffffffffa00f239a (vmx_prepare_switch_to_guest+0x10a/0x1d0 [kvm_intel])
      Call Trace:

      RIP: 0033:0x7fc08133bf47
    
    Note, the above sequence fails VM-Enter due to invalid guest state.
    Userspace can allow VM-Enter to succeed (after the WRMSR #GP) by adding
    a KVM_SET_SREGS w/ CR4.LA57=0 after KVM_SET_MSRS, in which case KVM will
    technically leak the host's KERNEL_GS_BASE into the guest.  But, as
    KERNEL_GS_BASE is a userspace-defined value/address, the leak is largely
    benign as a malicious userspace would simply be exposing its own data to
    the guest, and attacking a benevolent userspace would require multiple
    bugs in the userspace VMM.

    KVM: VMX: Add non-canonical check on writes to RTIT address MSRs
    
    commit fe6ed369fca98e99df55c932b85782a5687526b5 upstream.
    
    Reject writes to RTIT address MSRs if the data being written is a
    non-canonical address as the MSRs are subject to canonical checks, e.g.

    x86/KVM: Clean up host's steal time structure
    
    commit a6bd811f1209fe1c64c9f6fd578101d6436c6b6e upstream.
    
    Now that we are mapping kvm_steal_time from the guest directly we
    don't need keep a copy of it in kvm_vcpu_arch.st. The same is true
    for the stime field.
    
    This is part of CVE-2019-3016.

    x86/kvm: Cache gfn to pfn translation
    
    commit 917248144db5d7320655dbb41d3af0b8a0f3d589 upstream.
    
    __kvm_map_gfn()'s call to gfn_to_pfn_memslot() is
    * relatively expensive
    * in certain cases (such as when done from atomic context) cannot be called
    
    Stashing gfn-to-pfn mapping should help with both cases.

    x86/KVM: Make sure KVM_VCPU_FLUSH_TLB flag is not missed
    
    commit b043138246a41064527cf019a3d51d9f015e9796 upstream.
    
    There is a potential race in record_steal_time() between setting
    host-local vcpu->arch.st.steal.preempted to zero (i.e. clearing
    KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED) and propagating this value to the guest with
    kvm_write_guest_cached(). Between those two events the guest may
    still see KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED in its copy of kvm_steal_time, set
    KVM_VCPU_FLUSH_TLB and assume that hypervisor will do the right
    thing. Which it won't.
    
    Instad of copying, we should map kvm_steal_time and that will
    guarantee atomicity of accesses to @preempted.
    
    This is part of CVE-2019-3016.

    KVM: x86: Fix potential put_fpu() w/o load_fpu() on MPX platform
    
    commit f958bd2314d117f8c29f4821401bc1925bc2e5ef upstream.
    
    Unlike most state managed by XSAVE, MPX is initialized to zero on INIT.
    Because INITs are usually recognized in the context of a VCPU_RUN call,
    kvm_vcpu_reset() puts the guest's FPU so that the FPU state is resident
    in memory, zeros the MPX state, and reloads FPU state to hardware.  But,
    in the unlikely event that an INIT is recognized during
    kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_get_mpstate() via kvm_apic_accept_events(),
    kvm_vcpu_reset() will call kvm_put_guest_fpu() without a preceding
    kvm_load_guest_fpu() and corrupt the guest's FPU state (and possibly
    userspace's FPU state as well).
    
    Given that MPX is being removed from the kernel[*], fix the bug with the
    simple-but-ugly approach of loading the guest's FPU during
    KVM_GET_MP_STATE.
    
    [*] See commit f240652b6032b ("x86/mpx: Remove MPX APIs").

    KVM: x86: Refactor prefix decoding to prevent Spectre-v1/L1TF attacks
    
    commit 125ffc5e0a56a3eded608dc51e09d5ebf72cf652 upstream.
    
    This fixes Spectre-v1/L1TF vulnerabilities in
    vmx_read_guest_seg_selector(), vmx_read_guest_seg_base(),
    vmx_read_guest_seg_limit() and vmx_read_guest_seg_ar().  When
    invoked from emulation, these functions contain index computations
    based on the (attacker-influenced) segment value.  Using constants
    prevents the attack.

    aio: prevent potential eventfd recursion on poll
    
    commit 01d7a356872eec22ef34a33a5f9cfa917d145468 upstream.
    
    If we have nested or circular eventfd wakeups, then we can deadlock if
    we run them inline from our poll waitqueue wakeup handler. It's also
    possible to have very long chains of notifications, to the extent where
    we could risk blowing the stack.
    
    Check the eventfd recursion count before calling eventfd_signal(). If
    it's non-zero, then punt the signaling to async context. This is always
    safe, as it takes us out-of-line in terms of stack and locking context.

    eventfd: track eventfd_signal() recursion depth
    
    commit b5e683d5cab8cd433b06ae178621f083cabd4f63 upstream.
    
    eventfd use cases from aio and io_uring can deadlock due to circular
    or resursive calling, when eventfd_signal() tries to grab the waitqueue
    lock. On top of that, it's also possible to construct notification
    chains that are deep enough that we could blow the stack.
    
    Add a percpu counter that tracks the percpu recursion depth, warn if we
    exceed it. The counter is also exposed so that users of eventfd_signal()
    can do the right thing if it's non-zero in the context where it is
    called.

    bcache: add readahead cache policy options via sysfs interface
    
    commit 038ba8cc1bffc51250add4a9b9249d4331576d8f upstream.
    
    In year 2007 high performance SSD was still expensive, in order to
    save more space for real workload or meta data, the readahead I/Os
    for non-meta data was bypassed and not cached on SSD.
    
    In now days, SSD price drops a lot and people can find larger size
    SSD with more comfortable price. It is unncessary to alway bypass
    normal readahead I/Os to save SSD space for now.
    
    This patch adds options for readahead data cache policies via sysfs
    file /sys/block/bcache<N>/readahead_cache_policy, the options are,
    - "all": cache all readahead data I/Os.
    - "meta-only": only cache meta data, and bypass other regular I/Os.
    
    If users want to make bcache continue to only cache readahead request
    for metadata and bypass regular data readahead, please set "meta-only"
    to this sysfs file. By default, bcache will back to cache all read-
    ahead requests now.

    watchdog: fix UAF in reboot notifier handling in watchdog core code
    
    commit 69503e585192fdd84b240f18a0873d20e18a2e0a upstream.
    
    After the commit 44ea39420fc9 ("drivers/watchdog: make use of
    devm_register_reboot_notifier()") the struct notifier_block reboot_nb in
    the struct watchdog_device is removed from the reboot notifiers chain at
    the time watchdog's chardev is closed. But at least in i6300esb.c case
    reboot_nb is embedded in the struct esb_dev which can be freed on its
    device removal and before the chardev is closed, thus UAF at reboot:

    Fix the crash by reverting 44ea39420fc9 so unregister_reboot_notifier()
    is called when watchdog device is removed. This also makes handling of
    the reboot notifier unified with the handling of the restart handler,
    which is freed with unregister_restart_handler() in the same place.

    xen/balloon: Support xend-based toolstack take two
    
    commit eda4eabf86fd6806eaabc23fb90dd056fdac037b upstream.
    
    Commit 3aa6c19d2f38be ("xen/balloon: Support xend-based toolstack")
    tried to fix a regression with running on rather ancient Xen versions.
    Unfortunately the fix was based on the assumption that xend would
    just use another Xenstore node, but in reality only some downstream
    versions of xend are doing that. The upstream xend does not write
    that Xenstore node at all, so the problem must be fixed in another
    way.
    
    The easiest way to achieve that is to fall back to the behavior
    before commit 96edd61dcf4436 ("xen/balloon: don't online new memory
    initially") in case the static memory maximum can't be read.
    
    This is achieved by setting static_max to the current number of
    memory pages known by the system resulting in target_diff becoming
    zero.

    tools/kvm_stat: Fix kvm_exit filter name
    
    commit 5fcf3a55a62afb0760ccb6f391d62f20bce4a42f upstream.
    
    The filter name is fixed to "exit_reason" for some kvm_exit events, no
    matter what architect we have. Actually, the filter name ("exit_reason")
    is only applicable to x86, meaning it's broken on other architects
    including aarch64.
    
    This fixes the issue by providing various kvm_exit filter names, depending
    on architect we're on. Afterwards, the variable filter name is picked and
    applied through ioctl(fd, SET_FILTER).

    media: iguanair: fix endpoint sanity check
    
    commit 1b257870a78b0a9ce98fdfb052c58542022ffb5b upstream.
    
    Make sure to use the current alternate setting, which need not be the
    first one by index, when verifying the endpoint descriptors and
    initialising the URBs.
    
    Failing to do so could cause the driver to misbehave or trigger a WARN()
    in usb_submit_urb() that kernels with panic_on_warn set would choke on.

    drm: atmel-hlcdc: prefer a lower pixel-clock than requested
    
    commit 51a19d150b520f6cb42143f3bdffacd3c33d7ac5 upstream.
    
    The intention was to only select a higher pixel-clock rate than the
    requested, if a slight overclocking would result in a rate significantly
    closer to the requested rate than if the conservative lower pixel-clock
    rate is selected. The fixed patch has the logic the other way around and
    actually prefers the higher frequency. Fix that.

    drm: atmel-hlcdc: enable clock before configuring timing engine
    
    commit 2c1fb9d86f6820abbfaa38a6836157c76ccb4e7b upstream.
    
    Changing pixel clock source without having this clock source enabled
    will block the timing engine and the next operations after (in this case
    setting ATMEL_HLCDC_CFG(5) settings in atmel_hlcdc_crtc_mode_set_nofb()
    will fail). It is recomended (although in datasheet this is not present)
    to actually enabled pixel clock source before doing any changes on timing
    enginge (only SAM9X60 datasheet specifies that the peripheral clock and
    pixel clock must be enabled before using LCD controller).

    commit 7582026f6f3588ecebd281965c8a71aff6fb6158 upstream.
    
    When the first log header in a journal happens to have a sequence
    number of 0, a bug in gfs2_find_jhead() causes it to prematurely exit,
    and return an uninitialized jhead with seq 0. This can cause failures
    in the caller. For instance, a mount fails in one test case.
    
    The correct behavior is for it to continue searching through the journal
    to find the correct journal head with the highest sequence number.

    sunrpc: expiry_time should be seconds not timeval
    
    commit 3d96208c30f84d6edf9ab4fac813306ac0d20c10 upstream.
    
    When upcalling gssproxy, cache_head.expiry_time is set as a
    timeval, not seconds since boot. As such, RPC cache expiry
    logic will not clean expired objects created under
    auth.rpcsec.context cache.
    
    This has proven to cause kernel memory leaks on field. Using
    64 bit variants of getboottime/timespec
    
    Expiration times have worked this way since 2010's c5b29f885afe "sunrpc:
    use seconds since boot in expiry cache".  The gssproxy code introduced
    in 2012 added gss_proxy_save_rsc and introduced the bug.  That's a while
    for this to lurk, but it required a bit of an extreme case to make it
    obvious.

    iwlwifi: don't throw error when trying to remove IGTK
    
    commit 197288d5ba8a5289f22d3aeb4fca3824bfd9b4af upstream.
    
    The IGTK keys are only removed by mac80211 after it has already
    removed the AP station.  This causes the driver to throw an error
    because mac80211 is trying to remove the IGTK when the station doesn't
    exist anymore.
    
    The firmware is aware that the station has been removed and can deal
    with it the next time we try to add an IGTK for a station, so we
    shouldn't try to remove the key if the station ID is
    IWL_MVM_INVALID_STA.  Do this by removing the check for mvm_sta before
    calling iwl_mvm_send_sta_igtk() and check return from that function
    gracefully if the station ID is invalid.

    ARM: tegra: Enable PLLP bypass during Tegra124 LP1
    
    commit 1a3388d506bf5b45bb283e6a4c4706cfb4897333 upstream.
    
    For a little over a year, U-Boot has configured the flow controller to
    perform automatic RAM re-repair on off->on power transitions of the CPU
    rail[1]. This is mandatory for correct operation of Tegra124. However,
    RAM re-repair relies on certain clocks, which the kernel must enable and
    leave running. PLLP is one of those clocks. This clock is shut down
    during LP1 in order to save power. Enable bypass (which I believe routes
    osc_div_clk, essentially the crystal clock, to the PLL output) so that
    this clock signal toggles even though the PLL is not active. This is
    required so that LP1 power mode (system suspend) operates correctly.
    
    The bypass configuration must then be undone when resuming from LP1, so
    that all peripheral clocks run at the expected rate. Without this, many
    peripherals won't work correctly; for example, the UART baud rate would
    be incorrect.
    
    NVIDIA's downstream kernel code only does this if not compiled for
    Tegra30, so the added code is made conditional upon the chip ID.
    NVIDIA's downstream code makes this change conditional upon the active
    CPU cluster. The upstream kernel currently doesn't support cluster
    switching, so this patch doesn't test the active CPU cluster ID.

    That was due to btrfs_fs_device::aloc_tree being empty. Initially I
    thought this wasn't possible and as a percaution have put the assert in
    find_first_clear_extent_bit. Turns out this is indeed possible and could
    happen when a file system with SINGLE data/metadata profile has a 2nd
    device added. Until balance is run or a new chunk is allocated on this
    device it will be completely empty.
    
    In this case find_first_clear_extent_bit should return the full range
    [0, -1ULL] and let the caller handle this i.e for trim the end will be
    capped at the size of actual device.

    page_entry.page 0xffffea00f9bb7400 index 7680 bit 0 pid 1329874
    
    As you can see the kworker is waiting for bit 0 (PG_locked) on index
    7680, and aio-dio-invalid is waiting for bit 15 (PG_writeback) on index
    8148.  aio-dio-invalid has 7680, and the kworker epd looks like the
    following
    
      crash> struct extent_page_data ffffc900297bbbb0
      struct extent_page_data {
        bio = 0xffff889f747ed830,
        tree = 0xffff889eed6ba448,
        extent_locked = 0,
        sync_io = 0
      }
    
    Probably worth mentioning as well that it waits for writeback of the
    page to complete while holding a lock on it (at prepare_pages()).
    
    Using drgn I walked the bio pages looking for page
    0xffffea00fbfc7500 which is the one we're waiting for writeback on
    
      bio = Object(prog, 'struct bio', address=0xffff889f747ed830)
      for i in range(0, bio.bi_vcnt.value_()):
          bv = bio.bi_io_vec[i]
          if bv.bv_page.value_() == 0xffffea00fbfc7500:
              print("FOUND IT")
    
    which validated what I suspected.
    
    The fix for this is simple, flush the epd before we loop back around to
    the beginning of the file during writeout.

    Btrfs: fix race between adding and putting tree mod seq elements and nodes
    
    commit 7227ff4de55d931bbdc156c8ef0ce4f100c78a5b upstream.
    
    There is a race between adding and removing elements to the tree mod log
    list and rbtree that can lead to use-after-free problems.
    
    Consider the following example that explains how/why the problems happens:
    
    1) Task A has mod log element with sequence number 200. It currently is
       the only element in the mod log list;
    
    2) Task A calls btrfs_put_tree_mod_seq() because it no longer needs to
       access the tree mod log. When it enters the function, it initializes
       'min_seq' to (u64)-1. Then it acquires the lock 'tree_mod_seq_lock'
       before checking if there are other elements in the mod seq list.
       Since the list it empty, 'min_seq' remains set to (u64)-1. Then it
       unlocks the lock 'tree_mod_seq_lock';
    
    3) Before task A acquires the lock 'tree_mod_log_lock', task B adds
       itself to the mod seq list through btrfs_get_tree_mod_seq() and gets a
       sequence number of 201;
    
    4) Some other task, name it task C, modifies a btree and because there
       elements in the mod seq list, it adds a tree mod elem to the tree
       mod log rbtree. That node added to the mod log rbtree is assigned
       a sequence number of 202;
    
    5) Task B, which is doing fiemap and resolving indirect back references,
       calls btrfs get_old_root(), with 'time_seq' == 201, which in turn
       calls tree_mod_log_search() - the search returns the mod log node
       from the rbtree with sequence number 202, created by task C;
    
    6) Task A now acquires the lock 'tree_mod_log_lock', starts iterating
       the mod log rbtree and finds the node with sequence number 202. Since
       202 is less than the previously computed 'min_seq', (u64)-1, it
       removes the node and frees it;
    
    7) Task B still has a pointer to the node with sequence number 202, and
       it dereferences the pointer itself and through the call to
       __tree_mod_log_rewind(), resulting in a use-after-free problem.
    
    This issue can be triggered sporadically with the test case generic/561
    from fstests, and it happens more frequently with a higher number of
    duperemove processes. When it happens to me, it either freezes the VM or
    it produces a trace like the following before crashing:

    btrfs: drop log root for dropped roots
    
    commit 889bfa39086e86b52fcfaa04d72c95eaeb12f9a5 upstream.
    
    If we fsync on a subvolume and create a log root for that volume, and
    then later delete that subvolume we'll never clean up its log root.  Fix
    this by making switch_commit_roots free the log for any dropped roots we
    encounter.  The extra churn is because we need a btrfs_trans_handle, not
    the btrfs_transaction.

    btrfs: set trans->drity in btrfs_commit_transaction
    
    commit d62b23c94952e78211a383b7d90ef0afbd9a3717 upstream.
    
    If we abort a transaction we have the following sequence
    
    if (!trans->dirty && list_empty(&trans->new_bgs))
            return;
    WRITE_ONCE(trans->transaction->aborted, err);
    
    The idea being if we didn't modify anything with our trans handle then
    we don't really need to abort the whole transaction, maybe the other
    trans handles are fine and we can carry on.
    
    However in the case of create_snapshot we add a pending_snapshot object
    to our transaction and then commit the transaction.  We don't actually
    modify anything.  sync() behaves the same way, attach to an existing
    transaction and commit it.  This means that if we have an IO error in
    the right places we could abort the committing transaction with our
    trans->dirty being not set and thus not set transaction->aborted.
    
    This is a problem because in the create_snapshot() case we depend on
    pending->error being set to something, or btrfs_commit_transaction
    returning an error.
    
    If we are not the trans handle that gets to commit the transaction, and
    we're waiting on the commit to happen we get our return value from
    cur_trans->aborted.  If this was not set to anything because sync() hit
    an error in the transaction commit before it could modify anything then
    cur_trans->aborted would be 0.  Thus we'd return 0 from
    btrfs_commit_transaction() in create_snapshot.
    
    This is a problem because we then try to do things with
    pending_snapshot->snap, which will be NULL because we didn't create the
    snapshot, and then we'll get a NULL pointer dereference like the
    following
    
    "BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000001f0"

    Btrfs: fix infinite loop during fsync after rename operations
    
    commit b5e4ff9d465da1233a2d9a47ebce487c70d8f4ab upstream.
    
    Recently fsstress (from fstests) sporadically started to trigger an
    infinite loop during fsync operations. This turned out to be because
    support for the rename exchange and whiteout operations was added to
    fsstress in fstests. These operations, unlike any others in fsstress,
    cause file names to be reused, whence triggering this issue. However
    it's not necessary to use rename exchange and rename whiteout operations
    trigger this issue, simple rename operations and file creations are
    enough to trigger the issue.
    
    The issue boils down to when we are logging inodes that conflict (that
    had the name of any inode we need to log during the fsync operation), we
    keep logging them even if they were already logged before, and after
    that we check if there's any other inode that conflicts with them and
    then add it again to the list of inodes to log. Skipping already logged
    inodes fixes the issue.
    
    Consider the following example:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
      $ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
    
      $ mkdir /mnt/testdir                           # inode 257
    
      $ touch /mnt/testdir/zz                        # inode 258
      $ ln /mnt/testdir/zz /mnt/testdir/zz_link
    
      $ touch /mnt/testdir/a                         # inode 259
    
      $ sync
    
      # The following 3 renames achieve the same result as a rename exchange
      # operation (<rename_exchange> /mnt/testdir/zz_link to /mnt/testdir/a).
    
      $ mv /mnt/testdir/a /mnt/testdir/a/tmp
      $ mv /mnt/testdir/zz_link /mnt/testdir/a
      $ mv /mnt/testdir/a/tmp /mnt/testdir/zz_link
    
      # The following rename and file creation give the same result as a
      # rename whiteout operation (<rename_whiteout> zz to a2).
    
      $ mv /mnt/testdir/zz /mnt/testdir/a2
      $ touch /mnt/testdir/zz                        # inode 260
    
      $ xfs_io -c fsync /mnt/testdir/zz
        --> results in the infinite loop
    
    The following steps happen:
    
    1) When logging inode 260, we find that its reference named "zz" was
       used by inode 258 in the previous transaction (through the commit
       root), so inode 258 is added to the list of conflicting indoes that
       need to be logged;
    
    2) After logging inode 258, we find that its reference named "a" was
       used by inode 259 in the previous transaction, and therefore we add
       inode 259 to the list of conflicting inodes to be logged;
    
    3) After logging inode 259, we find that its reference named "zz_link"
       was used by inode 258 in the previous transaction - we add inode 258
       to the list of conflicting inodes to log, again - we had already
       logged it before at step 3. After logging it again, we find again
       that inode 259 conflicts with him, and we add again 259 to the list,
       etc - we end up repeating all the previous steps.
    
    So fix this by skipping logging of conflicting inodes that were already
    logged.

    Btrfs: make deduplication with range including the last block work
    
    commit 831d2fa25ab8e27592b1b0268dae6f2dfaf7cc43 upstream.
    
    Since btrfs was migrated to use the generic VFS helpers for clone and
    deduplication, it stopped allowing for the last block of a file to be
    deduplicated when the source file size is not sector size aligned (when
    eof is somewhere in the middle of the last block). There are two reasons
    for that:
    
    1) The generic code always rounds down, to a multiple of the block size,
       the range's length for deduplications. This means we end up never
       deduplicating the last block when the eof is not block size aligned,
       even for the safe case where the destination range's end offset matches
       the destination file's size. That rounding down operation is done at
       generic_remap_check_len();
    
    2) Because of that, the btrfs specific code does not expect anymore any
       non-aligned range length's for deduplication and therefore does not
       work if such nona-aligned length is given.
    
    This patch addresses that second part, and it depends on a patch that
    fixes generic_remap_check_len(), in the VFS, which was submitted ealier
    and has the following subject:
    
      "fs: allow deduplication of eof block into the end of the destination file"
    
    These two patches address reports from users that started seeing lower
    deduplication rates due to the last block never being deduplicated when
    the file size is not aligned to the filesystem's block size.

    Btrfs: fix missing hole after hole punching and fsync when using NO_HOLES
    
    commit 0e56315ca147b3e60c7bf240233a301d3c7fb508 upstream.
    
    When using the NO_HOLES feature, if we punch a hole into a file and then
    fsync it, there are cases where a subsequent fsync will miss the fact that
    a hole was punched, resulting in the holes not existing after replaying
    the log tree.
    
    Essentially these cases all imply that, tree-log.c:copy_items(), is not
    invoked for the leafs that delimit holes, because nothing changed those
    leafs in the current transaction. And it's precisely copy_items() where
    we currenly detect and log holes, which works as long as the holes are
    between file extent items in the input leaf or between the beginning of
    input leaf and the previous leaf or between the last item in the leaf
    and the next leaf.
    
    First example where we miss a hole:
    
      *) The extent items of the inode span multiple leafs;
    
      *) The punched hole covers a range that affects only the extent items of
         the first leaf;
    
      *) The fsync operation is done in full mode (BTRFS_INODE_NEEDS_FULL_SYNC
         is set in the inode's runtime flags).
    
      That results in the hole not existing after replaying the log tree.
    
      For example, if the fs/subvolume tree has the following layout for a
      particular inode:
    
          Leaf N, generation 10:
    
          [ ... INODE_ITEM INODE_REF EXTENT_ITEM (0 64K) EXTENT_ITEM (64K 128K) ]
    
          Leaf N + 1, generation 10:
    
          [ EXTENT_ITEM (128K 64K) ... ]
    
      If at transaction 11 we punch a hole coverting the range [0, 128K[, we end
      up dropping the two extent items from leaf N, but we don't touch the other
      leaf, so we end up in the following state:
    
          Leaf N, generation 11:
    
          [ ... INODE_ITEM INODE_REF ]
    
          Leaf N + 1, generation 10:
    
          [ EXTENT_ITEM (128K 64K) ... ]
    
      A full fsync after punching the hole will only process leaf N because it
      was modified in the current transaction, but not leaf N + 1, since it
      was not modified in the current transaction (generation 10 and not 11).
      As a result the fsync will not log any holes, because it didn't process
      any leaf with extent items.
    
    Second example where we will miss a hole:
    
      *) An inode as its items spanning 5 (or more) leafs;
    
      *) A hole is punched and it covers only the extents items of the 3rd
         leaf. This resulsts in deleting the entire leaf and not touching any
         of the other leafs.
    
      So the only leaf that is modified in the current transaction, when
      punching the hole, is the first leaf, which contains the inode item.
      During the full fsync, the only leaf that is passed to copy_items()
      is that first leaf, and that's not enough for the hole detection
      code in copy_items() to determine there's a hole between the last
      file extent item in the 2nd leaf and the first file extent item in
      the 3rd leaf (which was the 4th leaf before punching the hole).
    
    Fix this by scanning all leafs and punch holes as necessary when doing a
    full fsync (less common than a non-full fsync) when the NO_HOLES feature
    is enabled. The lack of explicit file extent items to mark holes makes it
    necessary to scan existing extents to determine if holes exist.
    
    A test case for fstests follows soon.

    ext4: fix race conditions in ->d_compare() and ->d_hash()
    
    commit ec772f01307a2c06ebf6cdd221e6b518a71ddae7 upstream.
    
    Since ->d_compare() and ->d_hash() can be called in RCU-walk mode,
    ->d_parent and ->d_inode can be concurrently modified, and in
    particular, ->d_inode may be changed to NULL.  For ext4_d_hash() this
    resulted in a reproducible NULL dereference if a lookup is done in a
    directory being deleted, e.g. with:
    
            int main()
            {
                    if (fork()) {
                            for (;;) {
                                    mkdir("subdir", 0700);
                                    rmdir("subdir");
                            }
                    } else {
                            for (;;)
                                    access("subdir/file", 0);
                    }
            }
    
    ... or by running the 't_encrypted_d_revalidate' program from xfstests.
    Both repros work in any directory on a filesystem with the encoding
    feature, even if the directory doesn't actually have the casefold flag.
    
    I couldn't reproduce a crash in ext4_d_compare(), but it appears that a
    similar crash is possible there.
    
    Fix these bugs by reading ->d_parent and ->d_inode using READ_ONCE() and
    falling back to the case sensitive behavior if the inode is NULL.

    ext4: fix deadlock allocating crypto bounce page from mempool
    
    commit 547c556f4db7c09447ecf5f833ab6aaae0c5ab58 upstream.
    
    ext4_writepages() on an encrypted file has to encrypt the data, but it
    can't modify the pagecache pages in-place, so it encrypts the data into
    bounce pages and writes those instead.  All bounce pages are allocated
    from a mempool using GFP_NOFS.
    
    This is not correct use of a mempool, and it can deadlock.  This is
    because GFP_NOFS includes __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM, which enables the "never
    fail" mode for mempool_alloc() where a failed allocation will fall back
    to waiting for one of the preallocated elements in the pool.
    
    But since this mode is used for all a bio's pages and not just the
    first, it can deadlock waiting for pages already in the bio to be freed.
    
    This deadlock can be reproduced by patching mempool_alloc() to pretend
    that pool->alloc() always fails (so that it always falls back to the
    preallocations), and then creating an encrypted file of size > 128 KiB.
    
    Fix it by only using GFP_NOFS for the first page in the bio.  For
    subsequent pages just use GFP_NOWAIT, and if any of those fail, just
    submit the bio and start a new one.
    
    This will need to be fixed in f2fs too, but that's less straightforward.

    powerpc/futex: Fix incorrect user access blocking
    
    commit 9dc086f1e9ef39dd823bd27954b884b2062f9e70 upstream.
    
    The early versions of our kernel user access prevention (KUAP) were
    written by Russell and Christophe, and didn't have separate
    read/write access.
    
    At some point I picked up the series and added the read/write access,
    but I failed to update the usages in futex.h to correctly allow read
    and write.
    
    However we didn't notice because of another bug which was causing the
    low-level code to always enable read and write. That bug was fixed
    recently in commit 1d8f739b07bd ("powerpc/kuap: Fix set direction in
    allow/prevent_user_access()").
    
    futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() is passed the user address as %3 and
    does:
    
      1:     lwarx   %1,  0, %3
             cmpw    0,  %1, %4
             bne-    3f
      2:     stwcx.  %5,  0, %3
    
    Which clearly loads and stores from/to %3. The logic in
    arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser() is similar, so fix both of them to use
    allow_read_write_user().
    
    Without this fix, and with PPC_KUAP_DEBUG=y, we see eg:

    handler, adjust the position of tasklet_init to fix the wrong order.
    
    Besides, to fix the missed tasklet_kill, this patch adds a helper
    function and uses devm_add_action to kill the tasklet automatically.

    The function crypto_spawn_alg is racy because it drops the lock
    before shooting the dying algorithm.  The algorithm could disappear
    altogether before we shoot it.
    
    This patch fixes it by moving the shooting into the locked section.

    The SIMD based GHASH implementation for arm64 is typically much faster

    clearly preferred when available. So bump the priority to reflect that.

    commit 11548f5a5747813ff84bed6f2ea01100053b0d8d upstream.
    
    AMD Seattle incorporates a non-PCI version of the v3 CCP crypto
    accelerator, and this version was left behind when the maximum
    RSA modulus size was parameterized in order to support v5 hardware
    which supports larger moduli than v3 hardware does. Due to this
    oversight, RSA acceleration no longer works at all on these systems.
    
    Fix this by setting the .rsamax property to the appropriate value
    for v3 platform hardware.

    crypto: api - fix unexpectedly getting generic implementation
    
    commit 2bbb3375d967155bccc86a5887d4a6e29c56b683 upstream.
    
    When CONFIG_CRYPTO_MANAGER_EXTRA_TESTS=y, the first lookup of an
    algorithm that needs to be instantiated using a template will always get
    the generic implementation, even when an accelerated one is available.
    
    This happens because the extra self-tests for the accelerated
    implementation allocate the generic implementation for comparison
    purposes, and then crypto_alg_tested() for the generic implementation
    "fulfills" the original request (i.e. sets crypto_larval::adult).
    
    This patch fixes this by only fulfilling the original request if
    we are currently the best outstanding larval as judged by the
    priority.  If we're not the best then we will ask all waiters on
    that larval request to retry the lookup.
    
    Note that this patch introduces a behaviour change when the module
    providing the new algorithm is unregistered during the process.
    Previously we would have failed with ENOENT, after the patch we
    will instead redo the lookup.

    commit f9e6bfdbaf0cf304d72c70a05d81acac01a04f48 upstream.
    
    When sample xdp_redirect_cpu was converted to use libbpf, the

    nobody notice that the tracepoints were not updating these maps.
    
    This fix doesn't use the new skeleton code, as this bug was introduced
    in v5.1 and stable might want to backport this. E.g. Red Hat QA uses
    this sample as part of their testing.

    commit b2e5e93ae8af6a34bca536cdc4b453ab1e707b8b upstream.
    
    The 'clean' rule in the samples/bpf Makefile tries to remove backup
    files (ending in ~). However, if no such files exist, it will instead try
    to remove the user's home directory. While the attempt is mostly harmless,
    it does lead to a somewhat scary warning like this:
    
    rm: cannot remove '~': Is a directory
    
    Fix this by using find instead of shell expansion to locate any actual
    backup files that need to be removed.

    btrfs: Handle another split brain scenario with metadata uuid feature
    
    commit 05840710149c7d1a78ea85a2db5723f706e97d8f upstream.
    
    There is one more cases which isn't handled by the original metadata
    uuid work. Namely, when a filesystem has METADATA_UUID incompat bit and
    the user decides to change the FSID to the original one e.g. have
    metadata_uuid and fsid match. In case of power failure while this
    operation is in progress we could end up in a situation where some of
    the disks have the incompat bit removed and the other half have both
    METADATA_UUID_INCOMPAT and FSID_CHANGING_IN_PROGRESS flags.
    
    This patch handles the case where a disk that has successfully changed

    Subsequently when a disk with both
    METADATA_UUID_INCOMPAT/FSID_CHANGING_IN_PROGRESS flags is scanned
    find_fsid_changed won't be able to find an appropriate btrfs_fs_devices.
    This is done by extending find_fsid_changed to correctly find

    the metadata_uuid of the currently scanned device.

    btrfs: fix improper setting of scanned for range cyclic write cache pages
    
    commit 556755a8a99be8ca3cd9fbe36aaf9b3b0339a00d upstream.
    
    We noticed that we were having regular CG OOM kills in cases where there
    was still enough dirty pages to avoid OOM'ing.  It turned out there's
    this corner case in btrfs's handling of range_cyclic where files that
    were being redirtied were not getting fully written out because of how
    we do range_cyclic writeback.
    
    We unconditionally were setting scanned = 1; the first time we found any
    pages in the inode.  This isn't actually what we want, we want it to be
    set if we've scanned the entire file.  For range_cyclic we could be
    starting in the middle or towards the end of the file, so we could write
    one page and then not write any of the other dirty pages in the file
    because we set scanned = 1.
    
    Fix this by not setting scanned = 1 if we find pages.  The rules for
    setting scanned should be
    
    1) !range_cyclic.  In this case we have a specified range to write out.
    2) range_cyclic && index == 0.  In this case we've started at the
       beginning and there is no need to loop around a second time.
    3) range_cyclic && we started at index > 0 and we've reached the end of
       the file without satisfying our nr_to_write.
    
    This patch fixes both of our writepages implementations to make sure
    these rules hold true.  This fixed our over zealous CG OOMs in
    production.

    crypto: pcrypt - Avoid deadlock by using per-instance padata queues
    
    commit bbefa1dd6a6d53537c11624752219e39959d04fb upstream.
    
    If the pcrypt template is used multiple times in an algorithm, then a
    deadlock occurs because all pcrypt instances share the same
    padata_instance, which completes requests in the order submitted.  That
    is, the inner pcrypt request waits for the outer pcrypt request while
    the outer request is already waiting for the inner.
    
    This patch fixes this by allocating a set of queues for each pcrypt
    instance instead of using two global queues.  In order to maintain
    the existing user-space interface, the pinst structure remains global
    so any sysfs modifications will apply to every pcrypt instance.
    
    Note that when an update occurs we have to allocate memory for
    every pcrypt instance.  Should one of the allocations fail we
    will abort the update without rolling back changes already made.
    
    The new per-instance data structure is called padata_shell and is
    essentially a wrapper around parallel_data.

    This is fine because the RCU "flavor" of the ftrace hash is protected by

    ASoC: SOF: core: release resources on errors in probe_continue
    
    [ Upstream commit 410e5e55c9c1c9c0d452ac5b9adb37b933a7747e ]
    
    The initial intent of releasing resources in the .remove does not work
    well with HDaudio codecs. If the probe_continue() fails in a work
    queue, e.g. due to missing firmware or authentication issues, we don't
    release any resources, and as a result the kernel oopses during
    suspend operations.
    
    The suggested fix is to release all resources during errors in
    probe_continue(), and use fw_state to track resource allocation
    state, so that .remove does not attempt to release the same
    hardware resources twice. PM operations are also modified so that
    no action is done if DSP resources have been freed due to
    an error at probe.

    ASoC: SOF: Introduce state machine for FW boot
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ca5cecbd1c1758666ab79446f19e0e61ed11444 ]
    
    Add a state machine for FW boot to track the
    different stages of FW boot and replace the boot_complete
    field with fw_state field in struct snd_sof_dev.
    This will be used to determine the actions to be performed
    during system suspend.
    
    One of the main motivations for adding this change is the
    fact that errors during the top-level SOF device probe cannot
    be propagated and therefore suspending the SOF device normally
    during system suspend could potentially run into errors.
    For example, with the current flow, if the FW boot failed
    for some reason and the system suspends, the SOF device
    suspend could fail because the CTX_SAVE IPC would be attempted
    even though the FW never really booted successfully causing it
    to time out. Another scenario that the state machine fixes
    is when the runtime suspend for the SOF device fails and
    the DSP is powered down nevertheless, the CTX_SAVE IPC during
    system suspend would timeout because the DSP is already
    powered down.

    dm writecache: fix incorrect flush sequence when doing SSD mode commit
    
    commit aa9509209c5ac2f0b35d01a922bf9ae072d0c2fc upstream.
    
    When committing state, the function writecache_flush does the following:
    1. write metadata (writecache_commit_flushed)
    2. flush disk cache (writecache_commit_flushed)
    3. wait for data writes to complete (writecache_wait_for_ios)
    4. increase superblock seq_count
    5. write the superblock
    6. flush disk cache
    
    It may happen that at step 3, when we wait for some write to finish, the
    disk may report the write as finished, but the write only hit the disk
    cache and it is not yet stored in persistent storage. At step 5 we write
    the superblock - it may happen that the superblock is written before the
    write that we waited for in step 3. If the machine crashes, it may result
    in incorrect data being returned after reboot.
    
    In order to fix the bug, we must swap steps 2 and 3 in the above sequence,
    so that we first wait for writes to complete and then flush the disk
    cache.

    dm space map common: fix to ensure new block isn't already in use
    
    commit 4feaef830de7ffdd8352e1fe14ad3bf13c9688f8 upstream.
    
    The space-maps track the reference counts for disk blocks allocated by
    both the thin-provisioning and cache targets.  There are variants for
    tracking metadata blocks and data blocks.
    
    Transactionality is implemented by never touching blocks from the
    previous transaction, so we can rollback in the event of a crash.
    
    When allocating a new block we need to ensure the block is free (has
    reference count of 0) in both the current and previous transaction.
    Prior to this fix we were doing this by searching for a free block in
    the previous transaction, and relying on a 'begin' counter to track
    where the last allocation in the current transaction was.  This
    'begin' field was not being updated in all code paths (eg, increment
    of a data block reference count due to breaking sharing of a neighbour
    block in the same btree leaf).
    
    This fix keeps the 'begin' field, but now it's just a hint to speed up
    the search.  Instead the current transaction is searched for a free
    block, and then the old transaction is double checked to ensure it's
    free.  Much simpler.
    
    This fixes reports of sm_disk_new_block()'s BUG_ON() triggering when
    DM thin-provisioning's snapshots are heavily used.

    dm zoned: support zone sizes smaller than 128MiB
    
    commit b39962950339912978484cdac50069258545d753 upstream.
    
    dm-zoned is observed to log failed kernel assertions and not work
    correctly when operating against a device with a zone size smaller
    than 128MiB (e.g. 32768 bits per 4K block). The reason is that the
    bitmap size per zone is calculated as zero with such a small zone
    size. Fix this problem and also make the code related to zone bitmap
    management be able to handle per zone bitmaps smaller than a single
    block.
    
    A dm-zoned-tools patch is required to properly format dm-zoned devices
    with zone sizes smaller than 128MiB.

    ARM: dma-api: fix max_pfn off-by-one error in __dma_supported()
    
    commit f3cc4e1d44a813a0685f2e558b78ace3db559722 upstream.
    
    max_pfn, as set in arch/arm/mm/init.c:
    
        static void __init find_limits(unsigned long *min,
                                       unsigned long *max_low,
                                       unsigned long *max_high)
        {
                *max_low = PFN_DOWN(memblock_get_current_limit());
                *min = PFN_UP(memblock_start_of_DRAM());
                *max_high = PFN_DOWN(memblock_end_of_DRAM());
        }
    
    with memblock_end_of_DRAM() pointing to the next byte after DRAM.  As
    such, max_pfn points to the PFN after the end of DRAM.
    
    Thus when using max_pfn to check DMA masks, we should subtract one when
    checking DMA ranges against it.
    
    Commit 8bf1268f48ad ("ARM: dma-api: fix off-by-one error in
    __dma_supported()") fixed the same issue, but missed this spot.
    
    This issue was found while working on the sun4i-csi v4l2 driver on the
    Allwinner R40 SoC.  On Allwinner SoCs, DRAM is offset at 0x40000000, and
    we are starting to use of_dma_configure() with the "dma-ranges" property
    in the device tree to have the DMA API handle the offset.
    
    In this particular instance, dma-ranges was set to the same range as the
    actual available (2 GiB) DRAM.  The following error appeared when the
    driver attempted to allocate a buffer:
    
        sun4i-csi 1c09000.csi: Coherent DMA mask 0x7fffffff (pfn 0x40000-0xc0000)
        covers a smaller range of system memory than the DMA zone pfn 0x0-0xc0001
        sun4i-csi 1c09000.csi: dma_alloc_coherent of size 307200 failed
    
    Fixing the off-by-one error makes things work.

    of: Add OF_DMA_DEFAULT_COHERENT & select it on powerpc
    
    commit dabf6b36b83a18d57e3d4b9d50544ed040d86255 upstream.
    
    There's an OF helper called of_dma_is_coherent(), which checks if a
    device has a "dma-coherent" property to see if the device is coherent
    for DMA.
    
    But on some platforms devices are coherent by default, and on some
    platforms it's not possible to update existing device trees to add the
    "dma-coherent" property.
    
    So add a Kconfig symbol to allow arch code to tell
    of_dma_is_coherent() that devices are coherent by default, regardless
    of the presence of the property.
    
    Select that symbol on powerpc when NOT_COHERENT_CACHE is not set, ie.
    when the system has a coherent cache.

    cpufreq: Avoid creating excessively large stack frames
    
    commit 1e4f63aecb53e48468661e922fc2fa3b83e55722 upstream.
    
    In the process of modifying a cpufreq policy, the cpufreq core makes
    a copy of it including all of the internals which is stored on the
    CPU stack.  Because struct cpufreq_policy is relatively large, this
    may cause the size of the stack frame to exceed the 2 KB limit and
    so the GCC complains when -Wframe-larger-than= is used.
    
    In fact, it is not necessary to copy the entire policy structure
    in order to modify it, however.
    
    First, because cpufreq_set_policy() obtains the min and max policy
    limits from frequency QoS now, it is not necessary to pass the limits
    to it from the callers.  The only things that need to be passed to it
    from there are the new governor pointer or (if there is a built-in
    governor in the driver) the "policy" value representing the governor
    choice.  They both can be passed as individual arguments, though, so
    make cpufreq_set_policy() take them this way and rework its callers
    accordingly.  This avoids making copies of cpufreq policies in the
    callers of cpufreq_set_policy().
    
    Second, cpufreq_set_policy() still needs to pass the new policy
    data to the ->verify() callback of the cpufreq driver whose task
    is to sanitize the min and max policy limits.  It still does not
    need to make a full copy of struct cpufreq_policy for this purpose,
    but it needs to pass a few items from it to the driver in case they
    are needed (different drivers have different needs in that respect
    and all of them have to be covered).  For this reason, introduce
    struct cpufreq_policy_data to hold copies of the members of
    struct cpufreq_policy used by the existing ->verify() driver
    callbacks and pass a pointer to a temporary structure of that
    type to ->verify() (instead of passing a pointer to full struct
    cpufreq_policy to it).
    
    While at it, notice that intel_pstate and longrun don't really need
    to verify the "policy" value in struct cpufreq_policy, so drop those
    check from them to avoid copying "policy" into struct
    cpufreq_policy_data (which allows it to be slightly smaller).
    
    Also while at it fix up white space in a couple of places and make
    cpufreq_set_policy() static (as it can be so).

    PM: core: Fix handling of devices deleted during system-wide resume
    
    commit 0552e05fdfea191a2cf3a0abd33574b5ef9ca818 upstream.
    
    If a device is deleted by one of its system-wide resume callbacks
    (for example, because it does not appear to be present or accessible
    any more) along with its children, the resume of the children may
    continue leading to use-after-free errors and other issues
    (potentially).
    
    Namely, if the device's children are resumed asynchronously, their
    resume may have been scheduled already before the device's callback
    runs and so the device may be deleted while dpm_wait_for_superior()
    is being executed for them.  The memory taken up by the parent device
    object may be freed then while dpm_wait() is waiting for the parent's
    resume callback to complete, which leads to a use-after-free.
    Moreover, the resume of the children is really not expected to
    continue after they have been unregistered, so it must be terminated
    right away in that case.
    
    To address this problem, modify dpm_wait_for_superior() to check
    if the target device is still there in the system-wide PM list of
    devices and if so, to increment its parent's reference counter, both
    under dpm_list_mtx which prevents device_del() running for the child
    from dropping the parent's reference counter prematurely.
    
    If the device is not present in the system-wide PM list of devices
    any more, the resume of it cannot continue, so check that again after
    dpm_wait() returns, which means that the parent's callback has been
    completed, and pass the result of that check to the caller of
    dpm_wait_for_superior() to allow it to abort the device's resume
    if it is not there any more.

    f2fs: fix race conditions in ->d_compare() and ->d_hash()
    
    commit 80f2388afa6ef985f9c5c228e36705c4d4db4756 upstream.
    
    Since ->d_compare() and ->d_hash() can be called in RCU-walk mode,
    ->d_parent and ->d_inode can be concurrently modified, and in
    particular, ->d_inode may be changed to NULL.  For f2fs_d_hash() this
    resulted in a reproducible NULL dereference if a lookup is done in a
    directory being deleted, e.g. with:
    
            int main()
            {
                    if (fork()) {
                            for (;;) {
                                    mkdir("subdir", 0700);
                                    rmdir("subdir");
                            }
                    } else {
                            for (;;)
                                    access("subdir/file", 0);
                    }
            }
    
    ... or by running the 't_encrypted_d_revalidate' program from xfstests.
    Both repros work in any directory on a filesystem with the encoding
    feature, even if the directory doesn't actually have the casefold flag.
    
    I couldn't reproduce a crash in f2fs_d_compare(), but it appears that a
    similar crash is possible there.
    
    Fix these bugs by reading ->d_parent and ->d_inode using READ_ONCE() and
    falling back to the case sensitive behavior if the inode is NULL.

    Setting softlimit larger than hardlimit seems meaningless

    there may be a bit of comfusion for users when they run

    power: supply: ltc2941-battery-gauge: fix use-after-free
    
    commit a60ec78d306c6548d4adbc7918b587a723c555cc upstream.
    
    This driver's remove path calls cancel_delayed_work().
    However, that function does not wait until the work function
    finishes. This could mean that the work function is still
    running after the driver's remove function has finished,
    which would result in a use-after-free.
    
    Fix by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync(), which ensures that
    that the work is properly cancelled, no longer running, and

    power: supply: axp20x_ac_power: Fix reporting online status
    
    commit 1c51aad8475d670ad58ae60adc9d32342381df8d upstream.
    
    AXP803/AXP813 have a flag that enables/disables the AC power supply
    input. This flag does not affect the status bits in PWR_INPUT_STATUS.
    Its effect can be verified by checking the battery charge/discharge
    state (bit 2 of PWR_INPUT_STATUS), or by examining the current draw on
    the AC input.
    
    Take this flag into account when getting the ONLINE property of the AC
    input, on PMICs where this flag is present.

    cpupower: Revert library ABI changes from commit ae2917093fb60bdc1ed3e
    
    commit 41ddb7e1f79693d904502ae9bea609837973eff8 upstream.
    
    Commit ae2917093fb6 ("tools/power/cpupower: Display boost frequency
    separately") modified the library function:
    
    struct cpufreq_available_frequencies
    *cpufreq_get_available_frequencies(unsigned int cpu)
    
    to
    struct cpufreq_frequencies
    *cpufreq_get_frequencies(const char *type, unsigned int cpu)
    
    This patch recovers the old API and implements the new functionality
    in a newly introduce method:
    struct cpufreq_boost_frequencies
    *cpufreq_get_available_frequencies(unsigned int cpu)
    
    This one should get merged into stable kernels back to 5.0 when
    the above had been introduced.

    scsi: megaraid_sas: Do not initiate OCR if controller is not in ready state
    
    commit 6d7537270e3283b92f9b327da9d58a4de40fe8d0 upstream.
    
    Driver initiates OCR if a DCMD command times out. But there is a deadlock
    if the driver attempts to invoke another OCR before the mutex lock
    (reset_mutex) is released from the previous session of OCR.
    
    This patch takes care of the above scenario using new flag
    MEGASAS_FUSION_OCR_NOT_POSSIBLE to indicate if OCR is possible.

    fs: allow deduplication of eof block into the end of the destination file
    
    commit a5e6ea18e3d132be4716eb5fdd520c2c234e3003 upstream.
    
    We always round down, to a multiple of the filesystem's block size, the
    length to deduplicate at generic_remap_check_len().  However this is only
    needed if an attempt to deduplicate the last block into the middle of the
    destination file is requested, since that leads into a corruption if the
    length of the source file is not block size aligned.  When an attempt to
    deduplicate the last block into the end of the destination file is
    requested, we should allow it because it is safe to do it - there's no
    stale data exposure and we are prepared to compare the data ranges for
    a length not aligned to the block (or page) size - in fact we even do
    the data compare before adjusting the deduplication length.
    
    After btrfs was updated to use the generic helpers from VFS (by commit
    34a28e3d77535e ("Btrfs: use generic_remap_file_range_prep() for cloning
    and deduplication")) we started to have user reports of deduplication
    not reflinking the last block anymore, and whence users getting lower
    deduplication scores.  The main use case is deduplication of entire
    files that have a size not aligned to the block size of the filesystem.
    
    We already allow cloning the last block to the end (and beyond) of the
    destination file, so allow for deduplication as well.

    padata: Remove broken queue flushing
    
    commit 07928d9bfc81640bab36f5190e8725894d93b659 upstream.
    
    The function padata_flush_queues is fundamentally broken because
    it cannot force padata users to complete the request that is
    underway.  IOW padata has to passively wait for the completion
    of any outstanding work.
    
    As it stands flushing is used in two places.  Its use in padata_stop
    is simply unnecessary because nothing depends on the queues to
    be flushed afterwards.
    
    The other use in padata_replace is more substantial as we depend
    on it to free the old pd structure.  This patch instead uses the
    pd->refcnt to dynamically free the pd structure once all requests
    are complete.

    commit dc91c3b6fe66a13ac76f6cb3b2100c0779cd3350 upstream.
    
    On AXP288 and newer PMICs, bit 7 of AXP20X_VBUS_IPSOUT_MGMT can be set
    to prevent using the VBUS input. However, when the VBUS unplugged and
    plugged back in, the bit automatically resets to zero.
    
    We need to set the register as volatile to prevent regmap from caching
    that bit. Otherwise, regcache will think the bit is already set and not
    write the register.

    hv_balloon: Balloon up according to request page number
    
    commit d33c240d47dab4fd15123d9e73fc8810cbc6ed6a upstream.
    
    Current code has assumption that balloon request memory size aligns
    with 2MB. But actually Hyper-V doesn't guarantee such alignment. When
    balloon driver receives non-aligned balloon request, it produces warning
    and balloon up more memory than requested in order to keep 2MB alignment.
    Remove the warning and balloon up memory according to actual requested
    memory size.

    ubifs: Fix deadlock in concurrent bulk-read and writepage
    
    commit f5de5b83303e61b1f3fb09bd77ce3ac2d7a475f2 upstream.
    
    In ubifs, concurrent execution of writepage and bulk read on the same file
    may cause ABBA deadlock, for example (Reproduce method see Link):
    
    Process A(Bulk-read starts from page4)         Process B(write page4 back)
      vfs_read                                       wb_workfn or fsync
      ...                                            ...
      generic_file_buffered_read                     write_cache_pages
        ubifs_readpage                                 LOCK(page4)
    
          ubifs_bulk_read                              ubifs_writepage
            LOCK(ui->ui_mutex)                           ubifs_write_inode
    
              ubifs_do_bulk_read                           LOCK(ui->ui_mutex)
                find_or_create_page(alloc page4)                  ↑
                  LOCK(page4)                   <--     ABBA deadlock occurs!
    
    In order to ensure the serialization execution of bulk read, we can't
    remove the big lock 'ui->ui_mutex' in ubifs_bulk_read(). Instead, we
    allow ubifs_do_bulk_read() to lock page failed by replacing
    find_or_create_page(FGP_LOCK) with
    pagecache_get_page(FGP_LOCK | FGP_NOWAIT).

    ubifs: Fix FS_IOC_SETFLAGS unexpectedly clearing encrypt flag
    
    commit 2b57067a7778484c10892fa191997bfda29fea13 upstream.
    
    UBIFS's implementation of FS_IOC_SETFLAGS fails to preserve existing
    inode flags that aren't settable by FS_IOC_SETFLAGS, namely the encrypt
    flag.  This causes the encrypt flag to be unexpectedly cleared.
    
    Fix it by preserving existing unsettable flags, like ext4 and f2fs do.
    
    Test case with kvm-xfstests shell:
    
        FSTYP=ubifs KEYCTL_PROG=keyctl
        . fs/ubifs/config
        . ~/xfstests/common/encrypt
        dev=$(__blkdev_to_ubi_volume /dev/vdc)
        ubiupdatevol -t $dev
        mount $dev /mnt -t ubifs
        k=$(_generate_session_encryption_key)
        mkdir /mnt/edir

        echo contents > /mnt/edir/file
        chattr +i /mnt/edir/file
        chattr -i /mnt/edir/file
    
    With the bug, the following errors occur on the last command:

    fscrypt: don't print name of busy file when removing key
    
    commit 13a10da94615d81087e718517794f2868a8b3fab upstream.
    
    When an encryption key can't be fully removed due to file(s) protected
    by it still being in-use, we shouldn't really print the path to one of
    these files to the kernel log, since parts of this path are likely to be
    encrypted on-disk, and (depending on how the system is set up) the
    confidentiality of this path might be lost by printing it to the log.
    
    This is a trade-off: a single file path often doesn't matter at all,
    especially if it's a directory; the kernel log might still be protected
    in some way; and I had originally hoped that any "inode(s) still busy"
    bugs (which are security weaknesses in their own right) would be quickly
    fixed and that to do so it would be super helpful to always know the
    file path and not have to run 'find dir -inum $inum' after the fact.
    
    But in practice, these bugs can be hard to fix (e.g. due to asynchronous
    process killing that is difficult to eliminate, for performance
    reasons), and also not tied to specific files, so knowing a file path
    doesn't necessarily help.
    
    So to be safe, for now let's just show the inode number, not the path.
    If someone really wants to know a path they can use 'find -inum'.

    The alarmtimer_rtc_add_device() function creates a wakeup source and then
    tries to grab a module reference. If that fails the function returns early
    with an error code, but fails to remove the wakeup source.
    
    Cleanup this exit path so there is no dangling wakeup source, which is
    named 'alarmtime' left allocated which will conflict with another RTC
    device that may be registered later.

    ACPI / battery: Deal better with neither design nor full capacity not being reported
    
    commit ff3154d1d89a2343fd5f82e65bc0cf1d4e6659b3 upstream.
    
    Commit b41901a2cf06 ("ACPI / battery: Do not export energy_full[_design] on
    devices without full_charge_capacity") added support for some (broken)
    devices which always report 0 for both design_capacity and
    full_charge_capacity.
    
    Since the device that commit was written as a fix for is not reporting any
    form of "full" capacity we cannot calculate the value for the
    POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CAPACITY, this is worked around by using an alternative
    array of available properties which does not contain this property.
    
    This is necessary because userspace (upower) treats us returning -ENODEV
    as 0 and then typically will trigger an emergency shutdown because of that.
    Userspace does not do this if the capacity sysfs attribute is not present
    at all.
    
    There are two potential problems with that commit:
     1) It assumes that both full_charge- and design-capacity are broken at the
        same time and only checks if full_charge- is broken.
     2) It assumes that this only ever happens for devices which report energy
        units rather then charge units.
    
    This commit fixes both issues by only using the alternative
    array of available properties if both full_charge- and design-capacity are
    broken and by also adding an alternative array of available properties for
    devices using mA units.

    ACPI / battery: Use design-cap for capacity calculations if full-cap is not available
    
    commit 5b74d1d16e2f5753fcbdecd6771b2d8370dda414 upstream.
    
    The ThunderSoft TS178 tablet's _BIX implementation reports design_capacity
    but not full_charge_capacity.
    
    Before this commit this would cause us to return -ENODEV for the capacity
    attribute, which userspace does not like. Specifically upower does this:
    
            if (sysfs_file_exists (native_path, "capacity")) {
                    percentage = sysfs_get_double (native_path, "capacity");
    
    Where the sysfs_get_double() helper returns 0 when we return -ENODEV,
    so the battery always reads 0% if we return -ENODEV.
    
    This commit fixes this by using the design-capacity instead of the
    full-charge-capacity when the full-charge-capacity is not available.

    ACPI / battery: Deal with design or full capacity being reported as -1
    
    commit cc99f0ad52467028cb1251160f23ad4bb65baf20 upstream.
    
    Commit b41901a2cf06 ("ACPI / battery: Do not export energy_full[_design]
    on devices without full_charge_capacity") added support for some (broken)
    devices which always report 0 for both design- and full_charge-capacity.
    
    This assumes that if the capacity is not being reported it is 0. The
    ThunderSoft TS178 tablet's _BIX implementation falsifies this assumption.
    It reports ACPI_BATTERY_VALUE_UNKNOWN (-1) as full_charge_capacity, which
    we treat as a valid value which causes several problems.
    
    This commit fixes this by adding a new ACPI_BATTERY_CAPACITY_VALID() helper
    which checks that the value is not 0 and not -1; and using this whenever we
    need to test if either design_capacity or full_charge_capacity is valid.

    ACPI: video: Do not export a non working backlight interface on MSI MS-7721 boards
    
    commit d21a91629f4b8e794fc4c0e0c17c85cedf1d806c upstream.
    
    Despite our heuristics to not wrongly export a non working ACPI backlight
    interface on desktop machines, we still end up exporting one on desktops
    using a motherboard from the MSI MS-7721 series.
    
    I've looked at improving the heuristics, but in this case a quirk seems
    to be the only way to solve this.
    
    While at it also add a comment to separate the video_detect_force_none
    entries in the video_detect_dmi_table from other type of entries, as we
    already do for the other entry types.

    mmc: spi: Toggle SPI polarity, do not hardcode it
    
    commit af3ed119329cf9690598c5a562d95dfd128e91d6 upstream.
    
    The code in mmc_spi_initsequence() tries to send a burst with
    high chipselect and for this reason hardcodes the device into
    SPI_CS_HIGH.
    
    This is not good because the SPI_CS_HIGH flag indicates
    logical "asserted" CS not always the physical level. In
    some cases the signal is inverted in the GPIO library and
    in that case SPI_CS_HIGH is already set, and enforcing
    SPI_CS_HIGH again will actually drive it low.
    
    Instead of hard-coding this, toggle the polarity so if the
    default is LOW it goes high to assert chipselect but if it
    is already high then toggle it low instead.

    PCI: keystone: Fix outbound region mapping
    
    commit 2d0c3fbe43fa0e6fcb7a6c755c5f4cd702c0d2f4 upstream.
    
    The Keystone outbound Address Translation Unit (ATU) maps PCI MMIO space in
    8 MB windows.  When programming the ATU windows, we previously incremented
    the starting address by 8, not 8 MB, so all the windows were mapped to the
    first 8 MB.  Therefore, only 8 MB of MMIO space was accessible.
    
    Update the loop so it increments the starting address by 8 MB, not 8, so
    more MMIO space is accessible.

    tracing: Fix now invalid var_ref_vals assumption in trace action
    
    [ Upstream commit d380dcde9a07ca5de4805dee11f58a98ec0ad6ff ]
    
    The patch 'tracing: Fix histogram code when expression has same var as
    value' added code to return an existing variable reference when
    creating a new variable reference, which resulted in var_ref_vals
    slots being reused instead of being duplicated.
    
    The implementation of the trace action assumes that the end of the
    var_ref_vals array starting at action_data.var_ref_idx corresponds to
    the values that will be assigned to the trace params. The patch
    mentioned above invalidates that assumption, which means that each
    param needs to explicitly specify its index into var_ref_vals.
    
    This fix changes action_data.var_ref_idx to an array of var ref
    indexes to account for that.

    powerpc/32s: Fix CPU wake-up from sleep mode
    
    commit 9933819099c4600b41a042f27a074470a43cf6b9 upstream.
    
    Commit f7354ccac844 ("powerpc/32: Remove CURRENT_THREAD_INFO and
    rename TI_CPU") broke the CPU wake-up from sleep mode (i.e. when
    _TLF_SLEEPING is set) by delaying the tovirt(r2, r2).
    
    This is because r2 is not restored by fast_exception_return. It used
    to work (by chance ?) because CPU wake-up interrupt never comes from
    user, so r2 is expected to point to 'current' on return.
    
    Commit e2fb9f544431 ("powerpc/32: Prepare for Kernel Userspace Access
    Protection") broke it even more by clobbering r0 which is not
    restored by fast_exception_return either.
    
    Use r6 instead of r0. This is possible because r3-r6 are restored by
    fast_exception_return and only r3-r5 are used for exception arguments.
    
    For r2 it could be converted back to virtual address, but stay on the
    safe side and restore it from the stack instead. It should be live
    in the cache at that moment, so loading from the stack should make
    no difference compared to converting it from phys to virt.

    powerpc/32s: Fix bad_kuap_fault()
    
    commit 6ec20aa2e510b6297906c45f009aa08b2d97269a upstream.
    
    At the moment, bad_kuap_fault() reports a fault only if a bad access
    to userspace occurred while access to userspace was not granted.
    
    But if a fault occurs for a write outside the allowed userspace
    segment(s) that have been unlocked, bad_kuap_fault() fails to
    detect it and the kernel loops forever in do_page_fault().
    
    Fix it by checking that the accessed address is within the allowed
    range.

    powerpc/mmu_gather: enable RCU_TABLE_FREE even for !SMP case
    
    commit 12e4d53f3f04e81f9e83d6fc10edc7314ab9f6b9 upstream.
    
    Patch series "Fixup page directory freeing", v4.
    
    This is a repost of patch series from Peter with the arch specific changes
    except ppc64 dropped.  ppc64 changes are added here because we are redoing
    the patch series on top of ppc64 changes.  This makes it easy to backport
    these changes.  Only the first 2 patches need to be backported to stable.
    
    The thing is, on anything SMP, freeing page directories should observe the
    exact same order as normal page freeing:
    
     1) unhook page/directory
     2) TLB invalidate
     3) free page/directory
    
    Without this, any concurrent page-table walk could end up with a
    Use-after-Free.  This is esp.  trivial for anything that has software
    page-table walkers (HAVE_FAST_GUP / software TLB fill) or the hardware
    caches partial page-walks (ie.  caches page directories).
    
    Even on UP this might give issues since mmu_gather is preemptible these
    days.  An interrupt or preempted task accessing user pages might stumble
    into the free page if the hardware caches page directories.
    
    This patch series fixes ppc64 and add generic MMU_GATHER changes to
    support the conversion of other architectures.  I haven't added patches
    w.r.t other architecture because they are yet to be acked.
    
    This patch (of 9):
    
    A followup patch is going to make sure we correctly invalidate page walk
    cache before we free page table pages.  In order to keep things simple
    enable RCU_TABLE_FREE even for !SMP so that we don't have to fixup the
    !SMP case differently in the followup patch
    
    !SMP case is right now broken for radix translation w.r.t page walk
    cache flush.  We can get interrupted in between page table free and
    that would imply we have page walk cache entries pointing to tables
    which got freed already.  Michael said "both our platforms that run on
    Power9 force SMP on in Kconfig, so the !SMP case is unlikely to be a
    problem for anyone in practice, unless they've hacked their kernel to
    build it !SMP."

    s390/mm: fix dynamic pagetable upgrade for hugetlbfs
    
    commit 5f490a520bcb393389a4d44bec90afcb332eb112 upstream.
    
    Commit ee71d16d22bb ("s390/mm: make TASK_SIZE independent from the number
    of page table levels") changed the logic of TASK_SIZE and also removed the
    arch_mmap_check() implementation for s390. This combination has a subtle
    effect on how get_unmapped_area() for hugetlbfs pages works. It is now
    possible that a user process establishes a hugetlbfs mapping at an address
    above 4 TB, without triggering a dynamic pagetable upgrade from 3 to 4
    levels.
    
    This is because hugetlbfs mappings will not use mm->get_unmapped_area, but
    rather file->f_op->get_unmapped_area, which currently is the generic
    implementation of hugetlb_get_unmapped_area() that does not know about s390
    dynamic pagetable upgrades, but with the new definition of TASK_SIZE, it
    will now allow mappings above 4 TB.
    
    Subsequent access to such a mapped address above 4 TB will result in a page
    fault loop, because the CPU cannot translate such a large address with 3
    pagetable levels. The fault handler will try to map in a hugepage at the
    address, but due to the folded pagetable logic it will end up with creating
    entries in the 3 level pagetable, possibly overwriting existing mappings,
    and then it all repeats when the access is retried.
    
    Apart from the page fault loop, this can have various nasty effects, e.g.
    kernel panic from one of the BUG_ON() checks in memory management code,
    or even data loss if an existing mapping gets overwritten.
    
    Fix this by implementing HAVE_ARCH_HUGETLB_UNMAPPED_AREA support for s390,
    providing an s390 version for hugetlb_get_unmapped_area() with pagetable
    upgrade support similar to arch_get_unmapped_area(), which will then be
    used instead of the generic version.

    KVM: arm64: Only sign-extend MMIO up to register width
    
    commit b6ae256afd32f96bec0117175b329d0dd617655e upstream.
    
    On AArch64 you can do a sign-extended load to either a 32-bit or 64-bit
    register, and we should only sign extend the register up to the width of
    the register as specified in the operation (by using the 32-bit Wn or
    64-bit Xn register specifier).
    
    As it turns out, the architecture provides this decoding information in
    the SF ("Sixty-Four" -- how cute...) bit.
    
    Let's take advantage of this with the usual 32-bit/64-bit header file
    dance and do the right thing on AArch64 hosts.

    KVM: arm/arm64: Correct AArch32 SPSR on exception entry
    
    commit 1cfbb484de158e378e8971ac40f3082e53ecca55 upstream.
    
    Confusingly, there are three SPSR layouts that a kernel may need to deal
    with:
    
    (1) An AArch64 SPSR_ELx view of an AArch64 pstate
    (2) An AArch64 SPSR_ELx view of an AArch32 pstate
    (3) An AArch32 SPSR_* view of an AArch32 pstate
    
    When the KVM AArch32 support code deals with SPSR_{EL2,HYP}, it's either
    dealing with #2 or #3 consistently. On arm64 the PSR_AA32_* definitions
    match the AArch64 SPSR_ELx view, and on arm the PSR_AA32_* definitions
    match the AArch32 SPSR_* view.
    
    However, when we inject an exception into an AArch32 guest, we have to
    synthesize the AArch32 SPSR_* that the guest will see. Thus, an AArch64
    host needs to synthesize layout #3 from layout #2.
    
    This patch adds a new host_spsr_to_spsr32() helper for this, and makes
    use of it in the KVM AArch32 support code. For arm64 we need to shuffle
    the DIT bit around, and remove the SS bit, while for arm we can use the
    value as-is.
    
    I've open-coded the bit manipulation for now to avoid having to rework
    the existing PSR_* definitions into PSR64_AA32_* and PSR32_AA32_*
    definitions. I hope to perform a more thorough refactoring in future so
    that we can handle pstate view manipulation more consistently across the
    kernel tree.

    KVM: arm/arm64: Correct CPSR on exception entry
    
    commit 3c2483f15499b877ccb53250d88addb8c91da147 upstream.
    
    When KVM injects an exception into a guest, it generates the CPSR value
    from scratch, configuring CPSR.{M,A,I,T,E}, and setting all other
    bits to zero.
    
    This isn't correct, as the architecture specifies that some CPSR bits
    are (conditionally) cleared or set upon an exception, and others are
    unchanged from the original context.
    
    This patch adds logic to match the architectural behaviour. To make this
    simple to follow/audit/extend, documentation references are provided,
    and bits are configured in order of their layout in SPSR_EL2. This
    layout can be seen in the diagram on ARM DDI 0487E.a page C5-426.
    
    Note that this code is used by both arm and arm64, and is intended to
    fuction with the SPSR_EL2 and SPSR_HYP layouts.

    arm64: acpi: fix DAIF manipulation with pNMI
    
    commit e533dbe9dcb199bb637a2c465f3a6e70564994fe upstream.
    
    Since commit:
    
      d44f1b8dd7e66d80 ("arm64: KVM/mm: Move SEA handling behind a single 'claim' interface")
    
    ... the top-level APEI SEA handler has the shape:
    
    1. current_flags = arch_local_save_flags()
    2. local_daif_restore(DAIF_ERRCTX)
    3. <GHES handler>
    4. local_daif_restore(current_flags)
    
    However, since commit:
    
      4a503217ce37e1f4 ("arm64: irqflags: Use ICC_PMR_EL1 for interrupt masking")
    
    ... when pseudo-NMIs (pNMIs) are in use, arch_local_save_flags() will save
    the PMR value rather than the DAIF flags.
    
    The combination of these two commits means that the APEI SEA handler will
    erroneously attempt to restore the PMR value into DAIF. Fix this by
    factoring local_daif_save_flags() out of local_daif_save(), so that we
    can consistently save DAIF in step #1, regardless of whether pNMIs are in
    use.
    
    Both commits were introduced concurrently in v5.0.

    ALSA: hda: Apply aligned MMIO access only conditionally
    
    commit 4d024fe8f806e20e577cc934204c5784c7063293 upstream.
    
    It turned out that the recent simplification of HD-audio bus access
    helpers caused a regression on the virtual HD-audio device on QEMU
    with ARM platforms.  The driver got a CORB/RIRB timeout and couldn't
    probe any codecs.
    
    The essential difference that caused a problem was the enforced
    aligned MMIO accesses by simplification.  Since snd-hda-tegra driver
    is enabled on ARM, it enables CONFIG_SND_HDA_ALIGNED_MMIO, which makes
    the all HD-audio drivers using the aligned MMIO accesses.  While this
    is mandatory for snd-hda-tegra, it seems that snd-hda-intel on ARM
    gets broken by this access pattern.
    
    For addressing the regression, this patch introduces a new flag,
    aligned_mmio, to hdac_bus object, and applies the aligned MMIO only
    when this flag is set.  This change affects only platforms with
    CONFIG_SND_HDA_ALIGNED_MMIO set, i.e. mostly only for ARM platforms.
    
    Unfortunately the patch became a big bigger than it should be, just
    because the former calls didn't take hdac_bus object in the argument,
    hence we had to extend the call patterns.

    Notice that in case _ptr1_ happens to be NULL, krealloc() behaves
    exactly like kmalloc().

    media: v4l2-rect.h: fix v4l2_rect_map_inside() top/left adjustments
    
    commit f51e50db4c20d46930b33be3f208851265694f3e upstream.
    
    boundary->width and boundary->height are sizes relative to
    boundary->left and boundary->top coordinates, but they were not being
    taken into consideration to adjust r->left and r->top, leading to the
    following error:
    
    Consider the follow as initial values for boundary and r:
    
    struct v4l2_rect boundary = {
            .left = 100,
            .top = 100,
            .width = 800,
            .height = 600,
    }
    
    struct v4l2_rect r = {
            .left = 0,
            .top = 0,
            .width = 1920,
            .height = 960,
    }
    
    calling v4l2_rect_map_inside(&r, &boundary) was modifying r to:
    
    r = {
            .left = 0,
            .top = 0,
            .width = 800,
            .height = 600,
    }
    
    Which is wrongly outside the boundary rectangle, because:
    
            v4l2_rect_set_max_size(r, boundary); // r->width = 800, r->height = 600
            ...
            if (r->left + r->width > boundary->width) // true
                    r->left = boundary->width - r->width; // r->left = 800 - 800
            if (r->top + r->height > boundary->height) // true
                    r->top = boundary->height - r->height; // r->height = 600 - 600
    
    Fix this by considering top/left coordinates from boundary.

    media: v4l2-core: compat: ignore native command codes
    
    commit 4a873f3fa5d6ca52e446d306dd7194dd86a09422 upstream.
    
    The do_video_ioctl() compat handler converts the compat command
    codes into the native ones before processing further, but this
    causes problems for 32-bit user applications that pass a command
    code that matches a 64-bit native number, which will then be
    handled the same way.
    
    Specifically, this breaks VIDIOC_DQEVENT_TIME from user space
    applications with 64-bit time_t, as the structure layout is
    the same as the native 64-bit layout on many architectures
    (x86 being the notable exception).
    
    Change the handler to use the converted command code only for
    passing into the native ioctl handler, not for deciding on the
    conversion, in order to make the compat behavior match the
    native behavior.
    
    Actual support for the 64-bit time_t version of VIDIOC_DQEVENT_TIME
    and other commands still needs to be added in a separate patch.

    media/v4l2-core: set pages dirty upon releasing DMA buffers
    
    commit 3c7470b6f68434acae459482ab920d1e3fabd1c7 upstream.
    
    After DMA is complete, and the device and CPU caches are synchronized,
    it's still required to mark the CPU pages as dirty, if the data was
    coming from the device.  However, this driver was just issuing a bare
    put_page() call, without any set_page_dirty*() call.
    
    Fix the problem, by calling set_page_dirty_lock() if the CPU pages were
    potentially receiving data from the device.

    mm: move_pages: report the number of non-attempted pages
    
    commit 5984fabb6e82d9ab4e6305cb99694c85d46de8ae upstream.
    
    Since commit a49bd4d71637 ("mm, numa: rework do_pages_move"), the
    semantic of move_pages() has changed to return the number of
    non-migrated pages if they were result of a non-fatal reasons (usually a
    busy page).
    
    This was an unintentional change that hasn't been noticed except for LTP
    tests which checked for the documented behavior.
    
    There are two ways to go around this change.  We can even get back to
    the original behavior and return -EAGAIN whenever migrate_pages is not
    able to migrate pages due to non-fatal reasons.  Another option would be
    to simply continue with the changed semantic and extend move_pages
    documentation to clarify that -errno is returned on an invalid input or
    when migration simply cannot succeed (e.g.  -ENOMEM, -EBUSY) or the
    number of pages that couldn't have been migrated due to ephemeral
    reasons (e.g.  page is pinned or locked for other reasons).
    
    This patch implements the second option because this behavior is in
    place for some time without anybody complaining and possibly new users
    depending on it.  Also it allows to have a slightly easier error
    handling as the caller knows that it is worth to retry when err > 0.
    
    But since the new semantic would be aborted immediately if migration is
    failed due to ephemeral reasons, need include the number of
    non-attempted pages in the return value too.

    commit fac0516b5534897bf4c4a88daa06a8cfa5611b23 upstream.
    
    If compound is true, this means it is a PMD mapped THP.  Which implies
    the page is not linked to any defer list.  So the first code chunk will
    not be executed.
    
    Also with this reason, it would not be proper to add this page to a
    defer list.  So the second code chunk is not correct.
    
    Based on this, we should remove the defer list related code.

    mm/memory_hotplug: fix remove_memory() lockdep splat
    
    commit f1037ec0cc8ac1a450974ad9754e991f72884f48 upstream.
    
    The daxctl unit test for the dax_kmem driver currently triggers the
    (false positive) lockdep splat below.  It results from the fact that
    remove_memory_block_devices() is invoked under the mem_hotplug_lock()
    causing lockdep entanglements with cpu_hotplug_lock() and sysfs (kernfs
    active state tracking).  It is a false positive because the sysfs
    attribute path triggering the memory remove is not the same attribute
    path associated with memory-block device.
    
    sysfs_break_active_protection() is not applicable since there is no real
    deadlock conflict, instead move memory-block device removal outside the
    lock.  The mem_hotplug_lock() is not needed to synchronize the
    memory-block device removal vs the page online state, that is already
    handled by lock_device_hotplug().  Specifically, lock_device_hotplug()
    is sufficient to allow try_remove_memory() to check the offline state of
    the memblocks and be assured that any in progress online attempts are
    flushed / blocked by kernfs_drain() / attribute removal.
    
    The add_memory() path safely creates memblock devices under the
    mem_hotplug_lock().  There is no kernfs active state synchronization in
    the memblock device_register() path, so nothing to fix there.
    
    This change is only possible thanks to the recent change that refactored
    memory block device removal out of arch_remove_memory() (commit
    4c4b7f9ba948 "mm/memory_hotplug: remove memory block devices before
    arch_remove_memory()"), and David's due diligence tracking down the
    guarantees afforded by kernfs_drain().  Not flagged for -stable since
    this only impacts ongoing development and lockdep validation, not a
    runtime issue.

    mm/sparse.c: reset section's mem_map when fully deactivated
    
    commit 1f503443e7df8dc8366608b4d810ce2d6669827c upstream.
    
    After commit ba72b4c8cf60 ("mm/sparsemem: support sub-section hotplug"),
    when a mem section is fully deactivated, section_mem_map still records
    the section's start pfn, which is not used any more and will be
    reassigned during re-addition.
    
    In analogy with alloc/free pattern, it is better to clear all fields of
    section_mem_map.
    
    Beside this, it breaks the user space tool "makedumpfile" [1], which
    makes assumption that a hot-removed section has mem_map as NULL, instead
    of checking directly against SECTION_MARKED_PRESENT bit.  (makedumpfile
    will be better to change the assumption, and need a patch)
    
    The bug can be reproduced on IBM POWERVM by "drmgr -c mem -r -q 5" ,
    trigger a crash, and save vmcore by makedumpfile

    memcg: fix a crash in wb_workfn when a device disappears
    
    commit 68f23b89067fdf187763e75a56087550624fdbee upstream.
    
    Without memcg, there is a one-to-one mapping between the bdi and
    bdi_writeback structures.  In this world, things are fairly
    straightforward; the first thing bdi_unregister() does is to shutdown
    the bdi_writeback structure (or wb), and part of that writeback ensures
    that no other work queued against the wb, and that the wb is fully
    drained.
    
    With memcg, however, there is a one-to-many relationship between the bdi
    and bdi_writeback structures; that is, there are multiple wb objects
    which can all point to a single bdi.  There is a refcount which prevents
    the bdi object from being released (and hence, unregistered).  So in
    theory, the bdi_unregister() *should* only get called once its refcount
    goes to zero (bdi_put will drop the refcount, and when it is zero,
    release_bdi gets called, which calls bdi_unregister).
    
    Unfortunately, del_gendisk() in block/gen_hd.c never got the memo about
    the Brave New memcg World, and calls bdi_unregister directly.  It does
    this without informing the file system, or the memcg code, or anything
    else.  This causes the root wb associated with the bdi to be
    unregistered, but none of the memcg-specific wb's are shutdown.  So when
    one of these wb's are woken up to do delayed work, they try to
    dereference their wb->bdi->dev to fetch the device name, but
    unfortunately bdi->dev is now NULL, thanks to the bdi_unregister()
    called by del_gendisk().  As a result, *boom*.
    
    Fortunately, it looks like the rest of the writeback path is perfectly
    happy with bdi->dev and bdi->owner being NULL, so the simplest fix is to
    create a bdi_dev_name() function which can handle bdi->dev being NULL.
    This also allows us to bulletproof the writeback tracepoints to prevent
    them from dereferencing a NULL pointer and crashing the kernel if one is
    tracing with memcg's enabled, and an iSCSI device dies or a USB storage
    stick is pulled.
    
    The most common way of triggering this will be hotremoval of a device
    while writeback with memcg enabled is going on.  It was triggering
    several times a day in a heavily loaded production environment.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Annotate endianess in Scarlett gen2 quirk
    
    commit d8f489355cff55b30731354317739a00cf1238bd upstream.
    
    The Scarlett gen2 mixer quirk code defines a few record types to
    communicate via USB hub, and those must be all little-endian.
    This patch changes the field types to LE to annotate endianess
    properly.  It also fixes the incorrect usage of leXX_to_cpu() in a
    couple of places, which was caught by sparse after this change.

    commit d2450c6937018d40d4111fe830fa48d4ddceb8d0 upstream.
    
    The UDC core uses req->num_sgs to judge if scatter buffer list is used.
    Eg: usb_gadget_map_request_by_dev. For f_fs sync io mode, the request
    is re-used for each request, so if the 1st request->length > PAGE_SIZE,
    and the 2nd request->length is <= PAGE_SIZE, the f_fs uses the 1st
    req->num_sgs for the 2nd request, it causes the UDC core get the wrong
    req->num_sgs value (The 2nd request doesn't use sg). For f_fs async
    io mode, it is not harm to initialize req->num_sgs as 0 either, in case,
    the UDC driver doesn't zeroed request structure.

    That commit removed USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME, which not only resets the USB
    device after resume, it also prevents the device from being runtime
    suspended by USB core. My experiment shows if the Realtek btusb device
    ever runtime suspends once, the entire wireless module becomes useless
    after reboot.
    
    So let's explicitly disable runtime suspend on Realtek btusb device for
    now.

    nvmet: Fix controller use after free
    
    commit 1a3f540d63152b8db0a12de508bfa03776217d83 upstream.
    
    After nvmet_install_queue() sets sq->ctrl calling to nvmet_sq_destroy()
    reduces the controller refcount. In case nvmet_install_queue() fails,
    calling to nvmet_ctrl_put() is done twice (at nvmet_sq_destroy and
    nvmet_execute_io_connect/nvmet_execute_admin_connect) instead of once for
    the queue which leads to use after free of the controller. Fix this by set
    NULL at sq->ctrl in case of a failure at nvmet_install_queue().

    rcu: Use READ_ONCE() for ->expmask in rcu_read_unlock_special()
    
    commit c51f83c315c392d9776c33eb16a2fe1349d65c7f upstream.
    
    The rcu_node structure's ->expmask field is updated only when holding the
    ->lock, but is also accessed locklessly.  This means that all ->expmask
    updates must use WRITE_ONCE() and all reads carried out without holding
    ->lock must use READ_ONCE().  This commit therefore changes the lockless
    ->expmask read in rcu_read_unlock_special() to use READ_ONCE().

    commit 844a378de3372c923909681706d62336d702531e upstream.
    
    The ->srcu_last_gp_end field is accessed from any CPU at any time
    by synchronize_srcu(), so non-initialization references need to use
    READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE().  This commit therefore makes that change.

    rcu: Avoid data-race in rcu_gp_fqs_check_wake()
    
    commit 6935c3983b246d5fbfebd3b891c825e65c118f2d upstream.
    
    The rcu_gp_fqs_check_wake() function uses rcu_preempt_blocked_readers_cgp()
    to read ->gp_tasks while other cpus might overwrite this field.
    
    We need READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() pairs to avoid compiler
    tricks and KCSAN splats like the following :

    rcu: Use *_ONCE() to protect lockless ->expmask accesses
    
    commit 15c7c972cd26d89a26788e609c53b5a465324a6c upstream.
    
    The rcu_node structure's ->expmask field is accessed locklessly when
    starting a new expedited grace period and when reporting an expedited
    RCU CPU stall warning.  This commit therefore handles the former by
    taking a snapshot of ->expmask while the lock is held and the latter
    by applying READ_ONCE() to lockless reads and WRITE_ONCE() to the
    corresponding updates.

    tracing: Fix sched switch start/stop refcount racy updates
    
    commit 64ae572bc7d0060429e40e1c8d803ce5eb31a0d6 upstream.
    
    Reading the sched_cmdline_ref and sched_tgid_ref initial state within
    tracing_start_sched_switch without holding the sched_register_mutex is
    racy against concurrent updates, which can lead to tracepoint probes
    being registered more than once (and thus trigger warnings within
    tracepoint.c).

    ipc/msg.c: consolidate all xxxctl_down() functions
    
    commit 889b331724c82c11e15ba0a60979cf7bded0a26c upstream.
    
    A use of uninitialized memory in msgctl_down() because msqid64 in
    ksys_msgctl hasn't been initialized.  The local | msqid64 | is created in
    ksys_msgctl() and then passed into msgctl_down().  Along the way msqid64
    is never initialized before msgctl_down() checks msqid64->msg_qbytes.

    netfilter: ipset: fix suspicious RCU usage in find_set_and_id
    
    commit 5038517119d50ed0240059b1d7fc2faa92371c08 upstream.
    
    find_set_and_id() is called when the NFNL_SUBSYS_IPSET mutex is held.
    However, in the error path there can be a follow-up recvmsg() without
    the mutex held. Use the start() function of struct netlink_dump_control
    instead of dump() to verify and report if the specified set does not
    exist.
    
    Thanks to Pablo Neira Ayuso for helping me to understand the subleties
    of the netlink protocol.

    media: uvcvideo: Avoid cyclic entity chains due to malformed USB descriptors
    
    commit 68035c80e129c4cfec659aac4180354530b26527 upstream.

    Looking into the output from usbmon, the interesting part is the
    following data packet:
    
      ffff880069c63e00 30710169 C Ci:1:002:0 0 143 = 09028f00 01030080
      00090403 00000e01 00000924 03000103 7c003328 010204db
    
    If we drop the lead configuration and interface descriptors, we're left
    with an output terminal descriptor describing a generic display:
    
      /* Output terminal descriptor */
      buf[0]        09
      buf[1]        24
      buf[2]        03      /* UVC_VC_OUTPUT_TERMINAL */
      buf[3]        00      /* ID */
      buf[4]        01      /* type == 0x0301 (UVC_OTT_DISPLAY) */
      buf[5]        03
      buf[6]        7c
      buf[7]        00      /* source ID refers to self! */
      buf[8]        33
    
    The problem with this descriptor is that it is self-referential: the
    source ID of 0 matches itself! This causes the 'struct uvc_entity'
    representing the display to be added to its chain list twice during
    'uvc_scan_chain()': once via 'uvc_scan_chain_entity()' when it is
    processed directly from the 'dev->entities' list and then again
    immediately afterwards when trying to follow the source ID in
    'uvc_scan_chain_forward()'
    
    Add a check before adding an entity to a chain list to ensure that the
    entity is not already part of a chain.

    bnxt_en: Fix logic that disables Bus Master during firmware reset.
    
    [ Upstream commit d407302895d3f3ca3a333c711744a95e0b1b0150 ]
    
    The current logic that calls pci_disable_device() in __bnxt_close_nic()
    during firmware reset is flawed.  If firmware is still alive, we're
    disabling the device too early, causing some firmware commands to
    not reach the firmware.
    
    Fix it by moving the logic to bnxt_reset_close().  If firmware is
    in fatal condition, we call pci_disable_device() before we free
    any of the rings to prevent DMA corruption of the freed rings.  If
    firmware is still alive, we call pci_disable_device() after the
    last firmware message has been sent.

    netdevsim: fix stack-out-of-bounds in nsim_dev_debugfs_init()
    
    [ Upstream commit 6fb8852b1298200da39bd85788bc5755d1d56f32 ]
    
    When netdevsim dev is being created, a debugfs directory is created.
    The variable "dev_ddir_name" is 16bytes device name pointer and device
    name is "netdevsim<dev id>".
    The maximum dev id length is 10.
    So, 16bytes for device name isn't enough.
    
    Test commands:
        modprobe netdevsim
        echo "1000000000 0" > /sys/bus/netdevsim/new_device

    MAINTAINERS: correct entries for ISDN/mISDN section
    
    [ Upstream commit dff6bc1bfd462b76dc13ec19dedc2c134a62ac59 ]
    
    Commit 6d97985072dc ("isdn: move capi drivers to staging") cleaned up the
    isdn drivers and split the MAINTAINERS section for ISDN, but missed to add
    the terminal slash for the two directories mISDN and hardware. Hence, all
    files in those directories were not part of the new ISDN/mISDN SUBSYSTEM,
    but were considered to be part of "THE REST".
    
    Rectify the situation, and while at it, also complete the section with two
    further build files that belong to that subsystem.
    
    This was identified with a small script that finds all files belonging to
    "THE REST" according to the current MAINTAINERS file, and I investigated
    upon its output.

    rxrpc: Fix NULL pointer deref due to call->conn being cleared on disconnect
    
    [ Upstream commit 5273a191dca65a675dc0bcf3909e59c6933e2831 ]
    
    When a call is disconnected, the connection pointer from the call is
    cleared to make sure it isn't used again and to prevent further attempted
    transmission for the call.  Unfortunately, there might be a daemon trying
    to use it at the same time to transmit a packet.
    
    Fix this by keeping call->conn set, but setting a flag on the call to
    indicate disconnection instead.
    
    Remove also the bits in the transmission functions where the conn pointer is
    checked and a ref taken under spinlock as this is now redundant.

    rxrpc: Fix missing active use pinning of rxrpc_local object
    
    [ Upstream commit 04d36d748fac349b068ef621611f454010054c58 ]
    
    The introduction of a split between the reference count on rxrpc_local
    objects and the usage count didn't quite go far enough.  A number of kernel
    work items need to make use of the socket to perform transmission.  These
    also need to get an active count on the local object to prevent the socket
    from being closed.
    
    Fix this by getting the active count in those places.
    
    Also split out the raw active count get/put functions as these places tend
    to hold refs on the rxrpc_local object already, so getting and putting an
    extra object ref is just a waste of time.
    
    The problem can lead to symptoms like:

    rxrpc: Fix insufficient receive notification generation
    
    [ Upstream commit f71dbf2fb28489a79bde0dca1c8adfb9cdb20a6b ]
    
    In rxrpc_input_data(), rxrpc_notify_socket() is called if the base sequence
    number of the packet is immediately following the hard-ack point at the end
    of the function.  However, this isn't sufficient, since the recvmsg side
    may have been advancing the window and then overrun the position in which
    we're adding - at which point rx_hard_ack >= seq0 and no notification is
    generated.
    
    Fix this by always generating a notification at the end of the input

    bnxt_en: Fix TC queue mapping.
    
    [ Upstream commit 18e4960c18f484ac288f41b43d0e6c4c88e6ea78 ]
    
    The driver currently only calls netdev_set_tc_queue when the number of
    TCs is greater than 1.  Instead, the comparison should be greater than
    or equal to 1.  Even with 1 TC, we need to set the queue mapping.
    
    This bug can cause warnings when the number of TCs is changed back to 1.

    It's found that stmmac_xmit() and stmmac_resume() sometimes might
    run concurrently, possibly resulting in a race condition between
    mod_timer() and setup_timer(), being called by stmmac_xmit() and
    stmmac_resume() respectively.
    
    Since the resume() runs setup_timer() every time, it'd be safer to
    have del_timer_sync() in the suspend() as the counterpart.

    net_sched: fix an OOB access in cls_tcindex
    
    [ Upstream commit 599be01ee567b61f4471ee8078870847d0a11e8e ]
    
    As Eric noticed, tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash() uses cp->hash
    to compute the size of memory allocation, but cp->hash is
    set again after the allocation, this caused an out-of-bound
    access.
    
    So we have to move all cp->hash initialization and computation
    before the memory allocation. Move cp->mask and cp->shift together
    as cp->hash may need them for computation too.

    l2tp: Allow duplicate session creation with UDP
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d0d9a388a858e271bb70e71e99e7fe2a6fd6f64 ]
    
    In the past it was possible to create multiple L2TPv3 sessions with the
    same session id as long as the sessions belonged to different tunnels.
    The resulting sessions had issues when used with IP encapsulated tunnels,
    but worked fine with UDP encapsulated ones. Some applications began to
    rely on this behaviour to avoid having to negotiate unique session ids.
    
    Some time ago a change was made to require session ids to be unique across
    all tunnels, breaking the applications making use of this "feature".
    
    This change relaxes the duplicate session id check to allow duplicates
    if both of the colliding sessions belong to UDP encapsulated tunnels.

    gtp: use __GFP_NOWARN to avoid memalloc warning
    
    [ Upstream commit bd5cd35b782abf5437fbd01dfaee12437d20e832 ]
    
    gtp hashtable size is received by user-space.
    So, this hashtable size could be too large. If so, kmalloc will internally
    print a warning message.
    This warning message is actually not necessary for the gtp module.
    So, this patch adds __GFP_NOWARN to avoid this message.

    bnxt_en: Move devlink_register before registering netdev
    
    [ Upstream commit cda2cab0771183932d6ba73c5ac63bb63decdadf ]
    
    Latest kernels get the phys_port_name via devlink, if
    ndo_get_phys_port_name is not defined. To provide the phys_port_name
    correctly, register devlink before registering netdev.
    
    Also call devlink_port_type_eth_set() after registering netdev as
    devlink port updates the netdev structure and notifies user.

    sparc32: fix struct ipc64_perm type definition
    
    [ Upstream commit 34ca70ef7d3a9fa7e89151597db5e37ae1d429b4 ]
    
    As discussed in the strace issue tracker, it appears that the sparc32
    sysvipc support has been broken for the past 11 years. It was however
    working in compat mode, which is how it must have escaped most of the
    regular testing.
    
    The problem is that a cleanup patch inadvertently changed the uid/gid
    fields in struct ipc64_perm from 32-bit types to 16-bit types in uapi
    headers.
    
    Both glibc and uclibc-ng still use the original types, so they should
    work fine with compat mode, but not natively.  Change the definitions
    to use __kernel_uid32_t and __kernel_gid32_t again.
