    vhost: make sure log_num < in_num
    
    commit 060423bfdee3f8bc6e2c1bac97de24d5415e2bc4 upstream.
    
    The code assumes log_num < in_num everywhere, and that is true as long as
    in_num is incremented by descriptor iov count, and log_num by 1. However
    this breaks if there's a zero sized descriptor.
    
    As a result, if a malicious guest creates a vring desc with desc.len = 0,
    it may cause the host kernel to crash by overflowing the log array. This
    bug can be triggered during the VM migration.
    
    There's no need to log when desc.len = 0, so just don't increment log_num
    in this case.

    clk: s2mps11: Add used attribute to s2mps11_dt_match
    
    [ Upstream commit 9c940bbe2bb47e03ca5e937d30b6a50bf9c0e671 ]
    
    Clang warns after commit 8985167ecf57 ("clk: s2mps11: Fix matching when
    built as module and DT node contains compatible"):
    
    drivers/clk/clk-s2mps11.c:242:34: warning: variable 's2mps11_dt_match'
    is not needed and will not be emitted [-Wunneeded-internal-declaration]
    static const struct of_device_id s2mps11_dt_match[] = {
                                     ^
    1 warning generated.
    
    This warning happens when a variable is used in some construct that
    doesn't require a reference to that variable to be emitted in the symbol
    table; in this case, it's MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE, which only needs to hold
    the data of the variable, not the variable itself.
    
    $ nm -S drivers/clk/clk-s2mps11.o | rg s2mps11_dt_match
    00000078 000003d4 R __mod_of__s2mps11_dt_match_device_table
    
    Normally, with device ID table variables, it means that the variable
    just needs to be tied to the device declaration at the bottom of the
    file, like s2mps11_clk_id:
    
    $ nm -S drivers/clk/clk-s2mps11.o | rg s2mps11_clk_id
    00000000 00000078 R __mod_platform__s2mps11_clk_id_device_table
    00000000 00000078 r s2mps11_clk_id
    
    However, because the comment above this deliberately doesn't want this
    variable added to .of_match_table, we need to mark s2mps11_dt_match as
    __used to silence this warning. This makes it clear to Clang that the
    variable is used for something, even if a reference to it isn't being
    emitted.

    batman-adv: Only read OGM tvlv_len after buffer len check
    
    commit a15d56a60760aa9dbe26343b9a0ac5228f35d445 upstream.
    
    Multiple batadv_ogm_packet can be stored in an skbuff. The functions
    batadv_iv_ogm_send_to_if()/batadv_iv_ogm_receive() use
    batadv_iv_ogm_aggr_packet() to check if there is another additional
    batadv_ogm_packet in the skb or not before they continue processing the
    packet.
    
    The length for such an OGM is BATADV_OGM_HLEN +
    batadv_ogm_packet->tvlv_len. The check must first check that at least
    BATADV_OGM_HLEN bytes are available before it accesses tvlv_len (which is
    part of the header. Otherwise it might try read outside of the currently
    available skbuff to get the content of tvlv_len.

    ip6: fix skb leak in ip6frag_expire_frag_queue()
    
    commit 47d3d7fdb10a21c223036b58bd70ffdc24a472c4 upstream.
    
    Since ip6frag_expire_frag_queue() now pulls the head skb
    from frag queue, we should no longer use skb_get(), since
    this leads to an skb leak.
    
    Stefan Bader initially reported a problem in 4.4.stable [1] caused
    by the skb_get(), so this patch should also fix this issue.

    xfrm: clean up xfrm protocol checks
    
    commit dbb2483b2a46fbaf833cfb5deb5ed9cace9c7399 upstream.
    
    In commit 6a53b7593233 ("xfrm: check id proto in validate_tmpl()")
    I introduced a check for xfrm protocol, but according to Herbert
    IPSEC_PROTO_ANY should only be used as a wildcard for lookup, so
    it should be removed from validate_tmpl().
    
    And, IPSEC_PROTO_ANY is expected to only match 3 IPSec-specific
    protocols, this is why xfrm_state_flush() could still miss
    IPPROTO_ROUTING, which leads that those entries are left in
    net->xfrm.state_all before exit net. Fix this by replacing
    IPSEC_PROTO_ANY with zero.
    
    This patch also extracts the check from validate_tmpl() to
    xfrm_id_proto_valid() and uses it in parse_ipsecrequest().
    With this, no other protocols should be added into xfrm.

    powerpc/tm: Fix FP/VMX unavailable exceptions inside a transaction
    
    commit 8205d5d98ef7f155de211f5e2eb6ca03d95a5a60 upstream.
    
    When we take an FP unavailable exception in a transaction we have to
    account for the hardware FP TM checkpointed registers being
    incorrect. In this case for this process we know the current and
    checkpointed FP registers must be the same (since FP wasn't used
    inside the transaction) hence in the thread_struct we copy the current
    FP registers to the checkpointed ones.
    
    This copy is done in tm_reclaim_thread(). We use thread->ckpt_regs.msr
    to determine if FP was on when in userspace. thread->ckpt_regs.msr
    represents the state of the MSR when exiting userspace. This is setup
    by check_if_tm_restore_required().
    
    Unfortunatley there is an optimisation in giveup_all() which returns
    early if tsk->thread.regs->msr (via local variable `usermsr`) has
    FP=VEC=VSX=SPE=0. This optimisation means that
    check_if_tm_restore_required() is not called and hence
    thread->ckpt_regs.msr is not updated and will contain an old value.
    
    This can happen if due to load_fp=255 we start a userspace process
    with MSR FP=1 and then we are context switched out. In this case
    thread->ckpt_regs.msr will contain FP=1. If that same process is then
    context switched in and load_fp overflows, MSR will have FP=0. If that
    process now enters a transaction and does an FP instruction, the FP
    unavailable will not update thread->ckpt_regs.msr (the bug) and MSR
    FP=1 will be retained in thread->ckpt_regs.msr.  tm_reclaim_thread()
    will then not perform the required memcpy and the checkpointed FP regs
    in the thread struct will contain the wrong values.
    
    The code path for this happening is:
    
           Userspace:                      Kernel
                       Start userspace
                        with MSR FP/VEC/VSX/SPE=0 TM=1

    This patch moves up check_if_tm_restore_required() in giveup_all() to
    ensure thread->ckpt_regs.msr is updated correctly.
    
    A simple testcase to replicate this will be posted to
    tools/testing/selftests/powerpc/tm/tm-poison.c
    
    Similarly for VMX.
    
    This fixes CVE-2019-15030.

    drm/vmwgfx: Fix double free in vmw_recv_msg()
    
    commit 08b0c891605acf727e43e3e03a25857d3e789b61 upstream.
    
    We recently added a kfree() after the end of the loop:
    
            if (retries == RETRIES) {
                    kfree(reply);
                    return -EINVAL;
            }
    
    There are two problems.  First the test is wrong and because retries
    equals RETRIES if we succeed on the last iteration through the loop.
    Second if we fail on the last iteration through the loop then the kfree
    is a double free.
    
    When you're reading this code, please note the break statement at the
    end of the while loop.  This patch changes the loop so that if it's not
    successful then "reply" is NULL and we can test for that afterward.

    sched/fair: Don't assign runtime for throttled cfs_rq
    
    commit 5e2d2cc2588bd3307ce3937acbc2ed03c830a861 upstream.
    
    do_sched_cfs_period_timer() will refill cfs_b runtime and call
    distribute_cfs_runtime to unthrottle cfs_rq, sometimes cfs_b->runtime
    will allocate all quota to one cfs_rq incorrectly, then other cfs_rqs
    attached to this cfs_b can't get runtime and will be throttled.
    
    We find that one throttled cfs_rq has non-negative
    cfs_rq->runtime_remaining and cause an unexpetced cast from s64 to u64
    in snippet:
    
      distribute_cfs_runtime() {
        runtime = -cfs_rq->runtime_remaining + 1;
      }
    
    The runtime here will change to a large number and consume all
    cfs_b->runtime in this cfs_b period.
    
    According to Ben Segall, the throttled cfs_rq can have
    account_cfs_rq_runtime called on it because it is throttled before
    idle_balance, and the idle_balance calls update_rq_clock to add time
    that is accounted to the task.
    
    This commit prevents cfs_rq to be assgined new runtime if it has been
    throttled until that distribute_cfs_runtime is called.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix overridden device-specific initialization
    
    commit 89781d0806c2c4f29072d3f00cb2dd4274aabc3d upstream.
    
    The recent change to shuffle the codec initialization procedure for
    Realtek via commit 607ca3bd220f ("ALSA: hda/realtek - EAPD turn on
    later") caused the silent output on some machines.  This change was
    supposed to be safe, but it isn't actually; some devices have quirk
    setups to override the EAPD via COEF or BTL in the additional verb
    table, which is applied at the beginning of snd_hda_gen_init().  And
    this EAPD setup is again overridden in alc_auto_init_amp().
    
    For recovering from the regression, tell snd_hda_gen_init() not to
    apply the verbs there by a new flag, then apply the verbs in
    alc_init().

    ALSA: hda - Fix potential endless loop at applying quirks
    
    commit 333f31436d3db19f4286f8862a00ea1d8d8420a1 upstream.
    
    Since the chained quirks via chained_before flag is applied before the
    depth check, it may lead to the endless recursive calls, when the
    chain were set up incorrectly.  Fix it by moving the depth check at
    the beginning of the loop.
