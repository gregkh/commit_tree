    target: Allow Write Exclusive non-reservation holders to READ
    
    commit 1ecc7586922662e3ca2f3f0c3f17fec8749fc621 upstream.
    
    For PGR reservation of type Write Exclusive Access, allow all non
    reservation holding I_T nexuses with active registrations to READ
    from the device.
    
    This addresses a bug where active registrations that attempted
    to READ would result in an reservation conflict.

    target: Allow AllRegistrants to re-RESERVE existing reservation
    
    commit ae450e246e8540300699480a3780a420a028b73f upstream.
    
    This patch changes core_scsi3_pro_release() logic to allow an
    existing AllRegistrants type reservation to be re-reserved by
    any registered I_T nexus.
    
    This addresses a issue where AllRegistrants type RESERVE was
    receiving RESERVATION_CONFLICT status if dev_pr_res_holder did
    not match the same I_T nexus, instead of just returning GOOD
    status following spc4r34 Section 5.9.9:
    
    "If the device server receives a PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT command
     with RESERVE service action where the TYPE field and the SCOPE
     field contain the same values as the existing type and scope
     from a persistent reservation holder, it shall not make any
     change to the existing persistent reservation and shall complete
     the command with GOOD status."

    target: Avoid dropping AllRegistrants reservation during unregister
    
    commit 6c3c9baa0debeb4bcc52a78c4463a0a97518de10 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an issue with AllRegistrants reservations where
    an unregister operation by the I_T nexus reservation holder would
    incorrectly drop the reservation, instead of waiting until the
    last active I_T nexus is unregistered as per SPC-4.
    
    This includes updating __core_scsi3_complete_pro_release() to reset
    dev->dev_pr_res_holder with another pr_reg for this special case,
    as well as a new 'unreg' parameter to determine when the release
    is occuring from an implicit unregister, vs. explicit RELEASE.
    
    It also adds special handling in core_scsi3_free_pr_reg_from_nacl()
    to release the left-over pr_res_holder, now that pr_reg is deleted
    from pr_reg_list within __core_scsi3_complete_pro_release().

    target: Fix R_HOLDER bit usage for AllRegistrants
    
    commit d16ca7c5198fd668db10d2c7b048ed3359c12c54 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes the usage of R_HOLDER bit for an All Registrants
    reservation in READ_FULL_STATUS, where only the registration who
    issued RESERVE was being reported as having an active reservation.
    
    It changes core_scsi3_pri_read_full_status() to check ahead of the
    list walk of active registrations to see if All Registrants is active,
    and if so set R_HOLDER bit and scope/type fields for all active
    registrations.

    iscsi-target: Avoid early conn_logout_comp for iser connections
    
    commit f068fbc82e7696d67b1bb8189306865bedf368b6 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a iser specific logout bug where early complete()
    of conn->conn_logout_comp in iscsit_close_connection() was causing
    isert_wait4logout() to complete too soon, triggering a use after
    free NULL pointer dereference of iscsi_conn memory.
    
    The complete() was originally added for traditional iscsi-target
    when a ISCSI_LOGOUT_OP failed in iscsi_target_rx_opcode(), but given
    iser-target does not wait in logout failure, this special case needs
    to be avoided.

    target: Fix virtual LUN=0 target_configure_device failure OOPs
    
    commit 5f7da044f8bc1cfb21c962edf34bd5699a76e7ae upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference triggered by a late
    target_configure_device() -> alloc_workqueue() failure that results
    in target_free_device() being called with DF_CONFIGURED already set,
    which subsequently OOPses in destroy_workqueue() code.
    
    Currently this only happens at modprobe target_core_mod time when
    core_dev_setup_virtual_lun0() -> target_configure_device() fails,
    and the explicit target_free_device() gets called.
    
    To address this bug originally introduced by commit 0fd97ccf45, go
    ahead and move DF_CONFIGURED to end of target_configure_device()
    code to handle this special failure case.

    ARM: dts: DRA7x: Fix the bypass clock source for dpll_iva and others
    
    commit d2192ea09858a8535b056fcede1a41d824e0b3d8 upstream.
    
    Fixes: ee6c750761 (ARM: dts: dra7 clock data)
    
    On DRA7x, For DPLL_IVA, the ref clock(CLKINP) is connected to sys_clk1 and
    the bypass input(CLKINPULOW) is connected to iva_dpll_hs_clk_div clock.
    But the bypass input is not directly routed to bypass clkout instead
    both CLKINP and CLKINPULOW are connected to bypass clkout via a mux.
    
    This mux is controlled by the bit - CM_CLKSEL_DPLL_IVA[23]:DPLL_BYP_CLKSEL
    and it's POR value is zero which selects the CLKINP as bypass clkout.
    which means iva_dpll_hs_clk_div is not the bypass clock for dpll_iva_ck
    
    Fix this by adding another mux clock as parent in bypass mode.
    
    This design is common to most of the PLLs and the rest have only one bypass
    clock. Below is a list of the DPLLs that need this fix:
    
    DPLL_IVA, DPLL_DDR,
    DPLL_DSP, DPLL_EVE,
    DPLL_GMAC, DPLL_PER,
    DPLL_USB and DPLL_CORE

    ipvs: rerouting to local clients is not needed anymore
    
    commit 579eb62ac35845686a7c4286c0a820b4eb1f96aa upstream.
    
    commit f5a41847acc5 ("ipvs: move ip_route_me_harder for ICMP")
    from 2.6.37 introduced ip_route_me_harder() call for responses to

    ip_send_reply()." from 3.0 this rerouting is not needed anymore
    and should be avoided, especially in LOCAL_IN.

    x86/vdso: Fix the build on GCC5
    
    commit e893286918d2cde3a94850d8f7101cd1039e0c62 upstream.
    
    On gcc5 the kernel does not link:
    
      ld: .eh_frame_hdr table[4] FDE at 0000000000000648 overlaps table[5] FDE at 0000000000000670.
    
    Because prior GCC versions always emitted NOPs on ALIGN directives, but
    gcc5 started omitting them.
    
    .LSTARTFDEDLSI1 says:
    
            /* HACK: The dwarf2 unwind routines will subtract 1 from the
               return address to get an address in the middle of the
               presumed call instruction.  Since we didn't get here via
               a call, we need to include the nop before the real start
               to make up for it.  */
            .long .LSTART_sigreturn-1-.     /* PC-relative start address */
    
    But commit 69d0627a7f6e ("x86 vDSO: reorder vdso32 code") from 2.6.25
    replaced .org __kernel_vsyscall+32,0x90 by ALIGN right before
    __kernel_sigreturn.
    
    Of course, ALIGN need not generate any NOP in there. Esp. gcc5 collapses
    vclock_gettime.o and int80.o together with no generated NOPs as "ALIGN".
    
    So fix this by adding to that point at least a single NOP and make the
    function ALIGN possibly with more NOPs then.
    
    Kudos for reporting and diagnosing should go to Richard.

    x86/fpu: Drop_fpu() should not assume that tsk equals current
    
    commit f4c3686386393c120710dd34df2a74183ab805fd upstream.
    
    drop_fpu() does clear_used_math() and usually this is correct
    because tsk == current.
    
    However switch_fpu_finish()->restore_fpu_checking() is called before
    __switch_to() updates the "current_task" variable. If it fails,
    we will wrongly clear the PF_USED_MATH flag of the previous task.
    
    So use clear_stopped_child_used_math() instead.

    x86/fpu: Avoid math_state_restore() without used_math() in __restore_xstate_sig()
    
    commit a7c80ebcac3068b1c3cb27d538d29558c30010c8 upstream.
    
    math_state_restore() assumes it is called with irqs disabled,
    but this is not true if the caller is __restore_xstate_sig().
    
    This means that if ia32_fxstate == T and __copy_from_user()
    fails, __restore_xstate_sig() returns with irqs disabled too.
    
    This triggers:
    
      BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/rwsem.c:41
       dump_stack
       ___might_sleep
       ? _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore
       __might_sleep
       down_read
       ? _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore
       print_vma_addr
       signal_fault
       sys32_rt_sigreturn
    
    Change __restore_xstate_sig() to call set_used_math()
    unconditionally. This avoids enabling and disabling interrupts
    in math_state_restore(). If copy_from_user() fails, we can
    simply do fpu_finit() by hand.
    
    [ Note: this is only the first step. math_state_restore() should
            not check used_math(), it should set this flag. While
            init_fpu() should simply die. ]

    crypto: aesni - fix memory usage in GCM decryption
    
    commit ccfe8c3f7e52ae83155cb038753f4c75b774ca8a upstream.
    
    The kernel crypto API logic requires the caller to provide the
    length of (ciphertext || authentication tag) as cryptlen for the
    AEAD decryption operation. Thus, the cipher implementation must
    calculate the size of the plaintext output itself and cannot simply use
    cryptlen.
    
    The RFC4106 GCM decryption operation tries to overwrite cryptlen memory
    in req->dst. As the destination buffer for decryption only needs to hold
    the plaintext memory but cryptlen references the input buffer holding
    (ciphertext || authentication tag), the assumption of the destination
    buffer length in RFC4106 GCM operation leads to a too large size. This
    patch simply uses the already calculated plaintext size.
    
    In addition, this patch fixes the offset calculation of the AAD buffer
    pointer: as mentioned before, cryptlen already includes the size of the
    tag. Thus, the tag does not need to be added. With the addition, the AAD
    will be written beyond the already allocated buffer.
    
    Note, this fixes a kernel crash that can be triggered from user space
    via AF_ALG(aead) -- simply use the libkcapi test application
    from [1] and update it to use rfc4106-gcm-aes.
    
    Using [1], the changes were tested using CAVS vectors to demonstrate
    that the crypto operation still delivers the right results.

    crypto: arm/aes update NEON AES module to latest OpenSSL version
    
    commit 001eabfd54c0cbf9d7d16264ddc8cc0bee67e3ed upstream.
    
    This updates the bit sliced AES module to the latest version in the
    upstream OpenSSL repository (e620e5ae37bc). This is needed to fix a
    bug in the XTS decryption path, where data chunked in a certain way
    could trigger the ciphertext stealing code, which is not supposed to
    be active in the kernel build (The kernel implementation of XTS only
    supports round multiples of the AES block size of 16 bytes, whereas
    the conformant OpenSSL implementation of XTS supports inputs of
    arbitrary size by applying ciphertext stealing). This is fixed in
    the upstream version by adding the missing #ifndef XTS_CHAIN_TWEAK
    around the offending instructions.
    
    The upstream code also contains the change applied by Russell to
    build the code unconditionally, i.e., even if __LINUX_ARM_ARCH__ < 7,
    but implemented slightly differently.

    pagemap: do not leak physical addresses to non-privileged userspace
    
    commit ab676b7d6fbf4b294bf198fb27ade5b0e865c7ce upstream.
    
    As pointed by recent post[1] on exploiting DRAM physical imperfection,
    /proc/PID/pagemap exposes sensitive information which can be used to do
    attacks.
    
    This disallows anybody without CAP_SYS_ADMIN to read the pagemap.

    It's directly caused by 89d3cf6 [SCSI] libsas: add mutex for SMP task
    execution, but shows a deeper cause: expander functions expect to be able to
    cast to and treat domain devices as expanders.  The correct fix is to only do
    expander discover when we know we've got an expander device to avoid wrongly
    casting a non-expander device.

    Otherwise the guest can abuse that control to cause e.g. PCIe
    Unsupported Request responses by disabling memory and/or I/O decoding
    and subsequently causing (CPU side) accesses to the respective address
    ranges, which (depending on system configuration) may be fatal to the
    host.
    
    Note that to alter any of the bits collected together as
    PCI_COMMAND_GUEST permissive mode is now required to be enabled
    globally or on the specific device.

    xen/events: avoid NULL pointer dereference in dom0 on large machines
    
    commit 85e40b0539b24518c8bdf63e2605c8522377d00f upstream.
    
    Using the pvops kernel a NULL pointer dereference was detected on a
    large machine (144 processors) when booting as dom0 in
    evtchn_fifo_unmask() during assignment of a pirq.
    
    The event channel in question was the first to need a new entry in
    event_array[] in events_fifo.c. Unfortunately xen_irq_info_pirq_setup()
    is called with evtchn being 0 for a new pirq and the real event channel
    number is assigned to the pirq only during __startup_pirq().
    
    It is mandatory to call xen_evtchn_port_setup() after assigning the
    event channel number to the pirq to make sure all memory needed for the
    event channel is allocated.

                                 nilfs_writepage()
                                   nilfs_construct_dsync_segment()
                                     nilfs_transaction_lock() --> deadlock
    
    This can happen if commit 7ef3ff2fea8b ("nilfs2: fix deadlock of segment
    constructor over I_SYNC flag") is applied and roll-forward recovery was
    performed at mount time.  The roll-forward recovery can happen if datasync
    write is done and the file system crashes immediately after that.  For
    instance, we can reproduce the issue with the following steps:
    
     < nilfs2 is mounted on /nilfs (device: /dev/sdb1) >
     # dd if=/dev/zero of=/nilfs/test bs=4k count=1 && sync
     # dd if=/dev/zero of=/nilfs/test conv=notrunc oflag=dsync bs=4k
     count=1 && reboot -nfh
     < the system will immediately reboot >
     # mount -t nilfs2 /dev/sdb1 /nilfs
    
    The deadlock occurs because iput() can run segment constructor through
    writeback_single_inode() if MS_ACTIVE flag is not set on sb->s_flags.  The
    above commit changed segment constructor so that it calls iput()
    asynchronously for inodes with i_nlink == 0, but that change was
    imperfect.
    
    This fixes the another deadlock by deferring iput() in segment constructor
    even for the case that mount is not finished, that is, for the case that
    MS_ACTIVE flag is not set.

    regulator: core: Fix enable GPIO reference counting
    
    commit 29d62ec5f87fbeec8413e2215ddad12e7f972e4c upstream.
    
    Normally _regulator_do_enable() isn't called on an already-enabled
    rdev.  That's because the main caller, _regulator_enable() always
    calls _regulator_is_enabled() and only calls _regulator_do_enable() if
    the rdev was not already enabled.
    
    However, there is one caller of _regulator_do_enable() that doesn't
    check: regulator_suspend_finish().  While we might want to make
    regulator_suspend_finish() behave more like _regulator_enable(), it's
    probably also a good idea to make _regulator_do_enable() robust if it
    is called on an already enabled rdev.
    
    At the moment, _regulator_do_enable() is _not_ robust for already
    enabled rdevs if we're using an ena_pin.  Each time
    _regulator_do_enable() is called for an rdev using an ena_pin the
    reference count of the ena_pin is incremented even if the rdev was
    already enabled.  This is not as intended because the ena_pin is for
    something else: for keeping track of how many active rdevs there are
    sharing the same ena_pin.
    
    Here's how the reference counting works here:
    
    * Each time _regulator_enable() is called we increment
      rdev->use_count, so _regulator_enable() calls need to be balanced
      with _regulator_disable() calls.
    
    * There is no explicit reference counting in _regulator_do_enable()
      which is normally just a warapper around rdev->desc->ops->enable()
      with code for supporting delays.  It's not expected that the
      "ops->enable()" call do reference counting.
    
    * Since regulator_ena_gpio_ctrl() does have reference counting
      (handling the sharing of the pin amongst multiple rdevs), we
      shouldn't call it if the current rdev is already enabled.
    
    Note that as part of this we cleanup (remove) the initting of
    ena_gpio_state in regulator_register().  In _regulator_do_enable(),
    _regulator_do_disable() and _regulator_is_enabled() is is clear that
    ena_gpio_state should be the state of whether this particular rdev has
    requested the GPIO be enabled.  regulator_register() was initting it
    as the actual state of the pin.

    regulator: Only enable disabled regulators on resume
    
    commit 0548bf4f5ad6fc3bd93c4940fa48078b34609682 upstream.
    
    The _regulator_do_enable() call ought to be a no-op when called on an
    already-enabled regulator.  However, as an optimization
    _regulator_enable() doesn't call _regulator_do_enable() on an already
    enabled regulator.  That means we never test the case of calling
    _regulator_do_enable() during normal usage and there may be hidden
    bugs or warnings.  We have seen warnings issued by the tps65090 driver
    and bugs when using the GPIO enable pin.
    
    Let's match the same optimization that _regulator_enable() in
    regulator_suspend_finish().  That may speed up suspend/resume and also
    avoids exposing hidden bugs.

    mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Fix PIO FIFO draining
    
    commit 8dad0386b97c4bd6edd56752ca7f2e735fe5beb4 upstream.
    
    The NDDB register holds the data that are needed by the read and write
    commands.
    
    However, during a read PIO access, the datasheet specifies that after each 32
    bytes read in that register, when BCH is enabled, we have to make sure that the
    RDDREQ bit is set in the NDSR register.
    
    This fixes an issue that was seen on the Armada 385, and presumably other mvebu
    SoCs, when a read on a newly erased page would end up in the driver reporting a
    timeout from the NAND.

    ALSA: hda - Treat stereo-to-mono mix properly
    
    commit cc261738add93947d138d2fabad9f4dbed4e5c00 upstream.
    
    The commit [ef403edb7558: ALSA: hda - Don't access stereo amps for
    mono channel widgets] fixed the handling of mono widgets in general,
    but it still misses an exceptional case: namely, a mono mixer widget
    taking a single stereo input.  In this case, it has stereo volumes
    although it's a mono widget, and thus we have to take care of both
    left and right input channels, as stated in HD-audio spec ("7.1.3
    Widget Interconnection Rules").
    
    This patch covers this missing piece by adding proper checks of stereo
    amps in both the generic parser and the proc output codes.

    ALSA: hda - Fix regression of HD-audio controller fallback modes
    
    commit a1f3f1ca66bd12c339b17a0c2ef93a093f90a277 upstream.
    
    The commit [63e51fd708f5: ALSA: hda - Don't take unresponsive D3
    transition too serious] introduced a conditional fallback behavior to
    the HD-audio controller depending on the flag set.  However, it
    introduced a silly bug, too, that the flag was evaluated in a reverse
    way.  This resulted in a regression of HD-audio controller driver
    where it can't go to the fallback mode at communication errors.
    
    Unfortunately (or fortunately?) this didn't come up until recently
    because the affected code path is an error handling that happens only
    on an unstable hardware chip.  Most of recent chips work stably, thus
    they didn't hit this problem.  Now, we've got a regression report with
    a VIA chip, and this seems indeed requiring the fallback to the
    polling mode, and finally the bug was revealed.
    
    The fix is a oneliner to remove the wrong logical NOT in the check.
    (Lesson learned - be careful about double negation.)
    
    The bug should be backported to stable, but the patch won't be
    applicable to 3.13 or earlier because of the code splits.  The stable
    fix patches for earlier kernels will be posted later manually.

    though the nodes receive multiple inputs.  This leads to the
    inconsistent amp value after S3/S4 resume, for example.
    
    The fix is just to set codec->single_adc_amp flag.  Then the driver
    handles these ADC amps as if single connections.

    ALSA: hda - Don't access stereo amps for mono channel widgets
    
    commit ef403edb75580a3ec5d155f5de82155f0419c621 upstream.
    
    The current HDA generic parser initializes / modifies the amp values
    always in stereo, but this seems causing the problem on ALC3229 codec
    that has a few mono channel widgets: namely, these mono widgets react
    to actions for both channels equally.
    
    In the driver code, we do care the mono channel and create a control
    only for the left channel (as defined in HD-audio spec) for such a
    node.  When the control is updated, only the left channel value is
    changed.  However, in the resume, the right channel value is also
    restored from the initial value we took as stereo, and this overwrites
    the left channel value.  This ends up being the silent output as the
    right channel has been never touched and remains muted.
    
    This patch covers the places where unconditional stereo amp accesses
    are done and converts to the conditional accesses.

    spi: pl022: Fix race in giveback() leading to driver lock-up
    
    commit cd6fa8d2ca53cac3226fdcffcf763be390abae32 upstream.
    
    Commit fd316941c ("spi/pl022: disable port when unused") introduced a race,
    which leads to possible driver lock up (easily reproducible on SMP).
    
    The problem happens in giveback() function where the completion of the transfer
    is signalled to SPI subsystem and then the HW SPI controller is disabled. Another
    transfer might be setup in between, which brings driver in locked-up state.
    
    Exact event sequence on SMP:
    
    core0                                   core1
    
                                            => pump_transfers()

                                              => giveback()
                                                => spi_finalize_current_message()
    
    => pl022_unprepare_transfer_hardware()
    => pl022_transfer_one_message
      => flush()
      => do_interrupt_dma_transfer()
        => set_up_next_transfer()
        /* Enable SSP, turn on interrupts */
        writew((readw(SSP_CR1(pl022->virtbase)) |
               SSP_CR1_MASK_SSE), SSP_CR1(pl022->virtbase));
    
    ...
    
    => pl022_interrupt_handler()
      => readwriter()
    
                                            /* disable the SPI/SSP operation */
                                            => writew((readw(SSP_CR1(pl022->virtbase)) &
                                                      (~SSP_CR1_MASK_SSE)), SSP_CR1(pl022->virtbase));
    
    Lockup! SPI controller is disabled and the data will never be received. Whole
    SPI subsystem is waiting for transfer ACK and blocked.
    
    So, only signal transfer completion after disabling the controller.

    spi: atmel: Fix interrupt setup for PDC transfers
    
    commit 76e1d14b316d6f501ebc001e7a5d86b24ce5b615 upstream.
    
    Additionally to the current DMA transfer the PDC allows to set up a next DMA
    transfer. This is useful for larger SPI transfers.
    
    The driver currently waits for ENDRX as end of the transfer. But ENDRX is set
    when the current DMA transfer is done (RCR = 0), i.e. it doesn't include the
    next DMA transfer.
    Thus a subsequent SPI transfer could be started although there is currently a
    transfer in progress. This can cause invalid accesses to the SPI slave devices
    and to SPI transfer errors.
    
    This issue has been observed on a hardware with a M25P128 SPI NOR flash.
    
    So instead of ENDRX we should wait for RXBUFF. This flag is set if there is
    no more DMA transfer in progress (RCR = RNCR = 0).

    tpm/ibmvtpm: Additional LE support for tpm_ibmvtpm_send
    
    commit 62dfd912ab3b5405b6fe72d0135c37e9648071f1 upstream.
    
    Problem: When IMA and VTPM are both enabled in kernel config,
    kernel hangs during bootup on LE OS.
    
    Why?: IMA calls tpm_pcr_read() which results in tpm_ibmvtpm_send
    and tpm_ibmtpm_recv getting called. A trace showed that
    tpm_ibmtpm_recv was hanging.
    
    Resolution: tpm_ibmtpm_recv was hanging because tpm_ibmvtpm_send
    was sending CRQ message that probably did not make much sense
    to phype because of Endianness. The fix below sends correctly
    converted CRQ for LE. This was not caught before because it
    seems IMA is not enabled by default in kernel config and
    IMA exercises this particular code path in vtpm.
    
    Tested with IMA and VTPM enabled in kernel config and VTPM
    enabled on both a BE OS and a LE OS ppc64 lpar. This exercised
    CRQ and TPM command code paths in vtpm.

    cpuset: Fix cpuset sched_relax_domain_level
    
    commit 283cb41f426b723a0255702b761b0fc5d1b53a81 upstream.
    
    The cpuset.sched_relax_domain_level can control how far we do
    immediate load balancing on a system. However, it was found on recent
    kernels that echo'ing a value into cpuset.sched_relax_domain_level
    did not reduce any immediate load balancing.
    
    The reason this occurred was because the update_domain_attr_tree() traversal
    did not update for the "top_cpuset". This resulted in nothing being changed
    when modifying the sched_relax_domain_level parameter.
    
    This patch is able to address that problem by having update_domain_attr_tree()
    allow updates for the root in the cpuset traversal.

    workqueue: fix hang involving racing cancel[_delayed]_work_sync()'s for PREEMPT_NONE
    
    commit 8603e1b30027f943cc9c1eef2b291d42c3347af1 upstream.
    
    cancel[_delayed]_work_sync() are implemented using
    __cancel_work_timer() which grabs the PENDING bit using
    try_to_grab_pending() and then flushes the work item with PENDING set
    to prevent the on-going execution of the work item from requeueing
    itself.
    
    try_to_grab_pending() can always grab PENDING bit without blocking
    except when someone else is doing the above flushing during
    cancelation.  In that case, try_to_grab_pending() returns -ENOENT.  In
    this case, __cancel_work_timer() currently invokes flush_work().  The
    assumption is that the completion of the work item is what the other
    canceling task would be waiting for too and thus waiting for the same
    condition and retrying should allow forward progress without excessive
    busy looping
    
    Unfortunately, this doesn't work if preemption is disabled or the
    latter task has real time priority.  Let's say task A just got woken
    up from flush_work() by the completion of the target work item.  If,
    before task A starts executing, task B gets scheduled and invokes
    __cancel_work_timer() on the same work item, its try_to_grab_pending()
    will return -ENOENT as the work item is still being canceled by task A
    and flush_work() will also immediately return false as the work item
    is no longer executing.  This puts task B in a busy loop possibly
    preventing task A from executing and clearing the canceling state on
    the work item leading to a hang.
    
    task A                  task B                  worker
    
                                                    executing work
    __cancel_work_timer()
      try_to_grab_pending()
      set work CANCELING
      flush_work()
        block for work completion
                                                    completion, wakes up A
                            __cancel_work_timer()
                            while (forever) {
                              try_to_grab_pending()
                                -ENOENT as work is being canceled
                              flush_work()
                                false as work is no longer executing
                            }
    
    This patch removes the possible hang by updating __cancel_work_timer()
    to explicitly wait for clearing of CANCELING rather than invoking
    flush_work() after try_to_grab_pending() fails with -ENOENT.

    v3: bit_waitqueue() can't be used for work items defined in vmalloc
        area.  Switched to custom wake function which matches the target
        work item and exclusive wait and wakeup.
    
    v2: v1 used wake_up() on bit_waitqueue() which leads to NULL deref if
        the target bit waitqueue has wait_bit_queue's on it.  Use
        DEFINE_WAIT_BIT() and __wake_up_bit() instead.  Reported by Tomeu

    commit 969439016d2cf61fef53a973d7e6d2061c3793b1 upstream.
    
    When accessing CAN network interfaces with AF_PACKET sockets e.g. by dhclient
    this can lead to a skb_under_panic due to missing skb initialisations.
    
    Add the missing initialisations at the CAN skbuff creation times on driver
    level (rx path) and in the network layer (tx path).

    tcp: make connect() mem charging friendly
    
    [ Upstream commit 355a901e6cf1b2b763ec85caa2a9f04fbcc4ab4a ]
    
    While working on sk_forward_alloc problems reported by Denys
    Fedoryshchenko, we found that tcp connect() (and fastopen) do not call
    sk_wmem_schedule() for SYN packet (and/or SYN/DATA packet), so
    sk_forward_alloc is negative while connect is in progress.
    
    We can fix this by calling regular sk_stream_alloc_skb() both for the
    SYN packet (in tcp_connect()) and the syn_data packet in
    tcp_send_syn_data()
    
    Then, tcp_send_syn_data() can avoid copying syn_data as we simply
    can manipulate syn_data->cb[] to remove SYN flag (and increment seq)
    
    Instead of open coding memcpy_fromiovecend(), simply use this helper.
    
    This leaves in socket write queue clean fast clone skbs.
    
    This was tested against our fastopen packetdrill tests.

    net: compat: Update get_compat_msghdr() to match copy_msghdr_from_user() behaviour
    
    [ Upstream commit 91edd096e224941131f896b86838b1e59553696a ]
    
    Commit db31c55a6fb2 (net: clamp ->msg_namelen instead of returning an
    error) introduced the clamping of msg_namelen when the unsigned value
    was larger than sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage). This caused a
    msg_namelen of -1 to be valid. The native code was subsequently fixed by
    commit dbb490b96584 (net: socket: error on a negative msg_namelen).
    
    In addition, the native code sets msg_namelen to 0 when msg_name is
    NULL. This was done in commit (6a2a2b3ae075 net:socket: set msg_namelen
    to 0 if msg_name is passed as NULL in msghdr struct from userland) and
    subsequently updated by 08adb7dabd48 (fold verify_iovec() into
    copy_msghdr_from_user()).
    
    This patch brings the get_compat_msghdr() in line with
    copy_msghdr_from_user().

    rxrpc: bogus MSG_PEEK test in rxrpc_recvmsg()
    
    [ Upstream commit 7d985ed1dca5c90535d67ce92ef6ca520302340a ]
    
    [I would really like an ACK on that one from dhowells; it appears to be
    quite straightforward, but...]
    
    MSG_PEEK isn't passed to ->recvmsg() via msg->msg_flags; as the matter of
    fact, neither the kernel users of rxrpc, nor the syscalls ever set that bit
    in there.  It gets passed via flags; in fact, another such check in the same
    function is done correctly - as flags & MSG_PEEK.
    
    It had been that way (effectively disabled) for 8 years, though, so the patch
    needs beating up - that case had never been tested.  If it is correct, it's
    -stable fodder.

    It should be checking flags, not msg->msg_flags.  It's ->sendmsg()
    instances that need to look for that in ->msg_flags, ->recvmsg() ones
    (including the other ->recvmsg() instance in that file, as well as
    unix_dgram_recvmsg() this one claims to be imitating) check in flags.

    rds: avoid potential stack overflow
    
    [ Upstream commit f862e07cf95d5b62a5fc5e981dd7d0dbaf33a501 ]
    
    The rds_iw_update_cm_id function stores a large 'struct rds_sock' object
    on the stack in order to pass a pair of addresses. This happens to just
    fit withint the 1024 byte stack size warning limit on x86, but just
    exceed that limit on ARM, which gives us this warning:
    
    net/rds/iw_rdma.c:200:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
    
    As the use of this large variable is basically bogus, we can rearrange
    the code to not do that. Instead of passing an rds socket into
    rds_iw_get_device, we now just pass the two addresses that we have
    available in rds_iw_update_cm_id, and we change rds_iw_get_mr accordingly,
    to create two address structures on the stack there.

    net: sysctl_net_core: check SNDBUF and RCVBUF for min length
    
    [ Upstream commit b1cb59cf2efe7971d3d72a7b963d09a512d994c9 ]
    
    sysctl has sysctl.net.core.rmem_*/wmem_* parameters which can be
    set to incorrect values. Given that 'struct sk_buff' allocates from
    rcvbuf, incorrectly set buffer length could result to memory
    allocation failures. For example, set them as follows:
    
        # sysctl net.core.rmem_default=64
          net.core.wmem_default = 64
        # sysctl net.core.wmem_default=64
          net.core.wmem_default = 64
        # ping localhost -s 1024 -i 0 > /dev/null
    
    This could result to the following failure:

    Next, we can't just drop to a memcpy() call in the forward copy case
    where dst <= src.  The reason is that the cache initializing stores
    used in the Niagara memcpy() implementations can end up clearing out
    cache lines before we've sourced their original contents completely.
    
    For example, considering NG4memcpy, the main unrolled loop begins like
    this:
    
         load   src + 0x00
         load   src + 0x08
         load   src + 0x10
         load   src + 0x18
         load   src + 0x20
         store  dst + 0x00
    
    Assume dst is 64 byte aligned and let's say that dst is src - 8 for
    this memcpy() call.  That store at the end there is the one to the
    first line in the cache line, thus clearing the whole line, which thus
    clobbers "src + 0x28" before it even gets loaded.
    
    To avoid this, just fall through to a simple copy only mildly
    optimized for the case where src and dst are 8 byte aligned and the
    length is a multiple of 8 as well.  We could get fancy and call
    GENmemcpy() but this is good enough for how this thing is actually
    used.

    sparc: Touch NMI watchdog when walking cpus and calling printk
    
    [ Upstream commit 31aaa98c248da766ece922bbbe8cc78cfd0bc920 ]
    
    With the increase in number of CPUs calls to functions that dump
    output to console (e.g., arch_trigger_all_cpu_backtrace) can take
    a long time to complete. If IRQs are disabled eventually the NMI
    watchdog kicks in and creates more havoc. Avoid by telling the NMI
    watchdog everything is ok.

    sparc: perf: Make counting mode actually work
    
    [ Upstream commit d51291cb8f32bfae6b331e1838651f3ddefa73a5 ]
    
    Currently perf-stat (aka, counting mode) does not work:
    
    $ perf stat ls
    ...
     Performance counter stats for 'ls':
    
              1.585665      task-clock (msec)         #    0.580 CPUs utilized
                    24      context-switches          #    0.015 M/sec
                     0      cpu-migrations            #    0.000 K/sec
                    86      page-faults               #    0.054 M/sec

       <not supported>      branch-misses
    
           0.002735100 seconds time elapsed
    
    The reason is that state is never reset (stays with PERF_HES_UPTODATE set).
    Add a call to sparc_pmu_enable_event during the added_event handling.
    Clean up the encoding since pmu_start calls sparc_pmu_enable_event which
    does the same. Passing PERF_EF_RELOAD to sparc_pmu_start means the call
    to sparc_perf_event_set_period can be removed as well.
    
    With this patch:
    
    $ perf stat ls
    ...
     Performance counter stats for 'ls':
    
              1.552890      task-clock (msec)         #    0.552 CPUs utilized

    sparc: semtimedop() unreachable due to comparison error
    
    [ Upstream commit 53eb2516972b8c4628651dfcb926cb9ef8b2864a ]
    
    A bug was reported that the semtimedop() system call was always
    failing eith ENOSYS.
    
    Since SEMCTL is defined as 3, and SEMTIMEDOP is defined as 4,
    the comparison "call <= SEMCTL" will always prevent SEMTIMEDOP
    from getting through to the semaphore ops switch statement.
    
    This is corrected by changing the comparison to "call <= SEMTIMEDOP".

    sparc32: destroy_context() and switch_mm() needs to disable interrupts.
    
    [ Upstream commit 66d0f7ec9f1038452178b1993fc07fd96d30fd38 ]
    
    Load balancing can be triggered in the critical sections protected by
    srmmu_context_spinlock in destroy_context() and switch_mm() and can hang
    the cpu waiting for the rq lock of another cpu that in turn has called
    switch_mm hangning on srmmu_context_spinlock leading to deadlock.
    
    So, disable interrupt while taking srmmu_context_spinlock in
    destroy_context() and switch_mm() so we don't deadlock.
