    md: only allow remove_and_add_spares when no sync_thread running.
    
    commit 39772f0a7be3b3dc26c74ea13fe7847fd1522c8b upstream.
    
    The locking protocols in md assume that a device will
    never be removed from an array during resync/recovery/reshape.
    When that isn't happening, rcu or reconfig_mutex is needed
    to protect an rdev pointer while taking a refcount.  When
    it is happening, that protection isn't needed.
    
    Unfortunately there are cases were remove_and_add_spares() is
    called when recovery might be happening: is state_store(),
    slot_store() and hot_remove_disk().
    In each case, this is just an optimization, to try to expedite
    removal from the personality so the device can be removed from
    the array.  If resync etc is happening, we just have to wait
    for md_check_recover to find a suitable time to call
    remove_and_add_spares().
    
    This optimization and not essential so it doesn't
    matter if it fails.
    So change remove_and_add_spares() to abort early if
    resync/recovery/reshape is happening, unless it is called
    from md_check_recovery() as part of a newly started recovery.
    The parameter "this" is only NULL when called from
    md_check_recovery() so when it is NULL, there is no need to abort.
    
    As this can result in a NULL dereference, the fix is suitable
    for -stable.

    powerpc/64s/radix: Boot-time NULL pointer protection using a guard-PID
    
    commit eeb715c3e995fbdda0cc05e61216c6c5609bce66 upstream.
    
    This change restores and formalises the behaviour that access to NULL
    or other user addresses by the kernel during boot should fault rather
    than succeed and modify memory. This was inadvertently broken when
    fixing another bug, because it was previously not well defined and
    only worked by chance.
    
    powerpc/64s/radix uses high address bits to select an address space
    "quadrant", which determines which PID and LPID are used to translate
    the rest of the address (effective PID, effective LPID). The kernel
    mapping at 0xC... selects quadrant 3, which uses PID=0 and LPID=0. So
    the kernel page tables are installed in the PID 0 process table entry.
    
    An address at 0x0... selects quadrant 0, which uses PID=PIDR for
    translating the rest of the address (that is, it uses the value of the
    PIDR register as the effective PID). If PIDR=0, then the translation
    is performed with the PID 0 process table entry page tables. This is
    the kernel mapping, so we effectively get another copy of the kernel
    address space at 0. A NULL pointer access will access physical memory
    address 0.
    
    To prevent duplicating the kernel address space in quadrant 0, this
    patch allocates a guard PID containing no translations, and
    initializes PIDR with this during boot, before the MMU is switched on.
    Any kernel access to quadrant 0 will use this guard PID for
    translation and find no valid mappings, and therefore fault.
    
    After boot, this PID will be switchd away to user context PIDs, but
    those contain user mappings (and usually NULL pointer protection)
    rather than kernel mapping, which is much safer (and by design). It
    may be in future this is tightened further, which the guard PID could
    be used for.
    
    Commit 371b8044 ("powerpc/64s: Initialize ISAv3 MMU registers before
    setting partition table"), introduced this problem because it zeroes
    PIDR at boot. However previously the value was inherited from firmware
    or kexec, which is not robust and can be zero (e.g., mambo).

    ACPI / bus: Parse tables as term_list for Dell XPS 9570 and Precision M5530
    
    commit 36904703aeeeb6cd31993f1353c8325006229f9a upstream.
    
    The i2c touchpad on Dell XPS 9570 and Precision M5530 doesn't work out
    of box.
    
    The touchpad relies on its _INI method to update its _HID value from
    XXXX0000 to SYNA2393.
    
    Also, the _STA relies on value of I2CN to report correct status.
    
    Set acpi_gbl_parse_table_as_term_list so the value of I2CN can be
    correctly set up, and _INI can get run. The ACPI table in this machine
    is designed to get parsed this way.
    
    Also, change the quirk table to a more generic name.

    KVM/x86: remove WARN_ON() for when vm_munmap() fails
    
    commit 103c763c72dd2df3e8c91f2d7ec88f98ed391111 upstream.
    
    On x86, special KVM memslots such as the TSS region have anonymous
    memory mappings created on behalf of userspace, and these mappings are
    removed when the VM is destroyed.
    
    It is however possible for removing these mappings via vm_munmap() to
    fail.  This can most easily happen if the thread receives SIGKILL while
    it's waiting to acquire ->mmap_sem.   This triggers the 'WARN_ON(r < 0)'
    in __x86_set_memory_region().  syzkaller was able to hit this, using
    'exit()' to send the SIGKILL.  Note that while the vm_munmap() failure
    results in the mapping not being removed immediately, it is not leaked
    forever but rather will be freed when the process exits.
    
    It's not really possible to handle this failure properly, so almost
    every other caller of vm_munmap() doesn't check the return value.  It's
    a limitation of having the kernel manage these mappings rather than
    userspace.
    
    So just remove the WARN_ON() so that users can't spam the kernel log
    with this warning.

    KVM/VMX: Optimize vmx_vcpu_run() and svm_vcpu_run() by marking the RDMSR path as unlikely()
    
    commit 946fbbc13dce68902f64515b610eeb2a6c3d7a64 upstream.
    
    vmx_vcpu_run() and svm_vcpu_run() are large functions, and giving
    branch hints to the compiler can actually make a substantial cycle
    difference by keeping the fast path contiguous in memory.
    
    With this optimization, the retpoline-guest/retpoline-host case is
    about 50 cycles faster.

    KVM: X86: Fix SMRAM accessing even if VM is shutdown
    
    commit 95e057e25892eaa48cad1e2d637b80d0f1a4fac5 upstream.

    The testcase creates a first thread to issue KVM_SMI ioctl, and then creates
    a second thread to mmap and operate on the same vCPU.  This triggers a race
    condition when running the testcase with multiple threads. Sometimes one thread
    exits with a triple fault while another thread mmaps and operates on the same
    vCPU.  Because CS=0x3000/IP=0x8000 is not mapped, accessing the SMI handler
    results in an EPT misconfig. This patch fixes it by returning RET_PF_EMULATE
    in kvm_handle_bad_page(), which will go on to cause an emulation failure and an
    exit with KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR.

    ARM: kvm: fix building with gcc-8
    
    commit 67870eb1204223598ea6d8a4467b482e9f5875b5 upstream.
    
    In banked-sr.c, we use a top-level '__asm__(".arch_extension virt")'
    statement to allow compilation of a multi-CPU kernel for ARMv6
    and older ARMv7-A that don't normally support access to the banked
    registers.
    
    This is considered to be a programming error by the gcc developers
    and will no longer work in gcc-8, where we now get a build error:
    
    /tmp/cc4Qy7GR.s:34: Error: Banked registers are not available with this architecture. -- `mrs r3,SP_usr'
    /tmp/cc4Qy7GR.s:41: Error: Banked registers are not available with this architecture. -- `mrs r3,ELR_hyp'
    /tmp/cc4Qy7GR.s:55: Error: Banked registers are not available with this architecture. -- `mrs r3,SP_svc'
    /tmp/cc4Qy7GR.s:62: Error: Banked registers are not available with this architecture. -- `mrs r3,LR_svc'
    /tmp/cc4Qy7GR.s:69: Error: Banked registers are not available with this architecture. -- `mrs r3,SPSR_svc'
    /tmp/cc4Qy7GR.s:76: Error: Banked registers are not available with this architecture. -- `mrs r3,SP_abt'
    
    Passign the '-march-armv7ve' flag to gcc works, and is ok here, because
    we know the functions won't ever be called on pre-ARMv7VE machines.
    Unfortunately, older compiler versions (4.8 and earlier) do not understand
    that flag, so we still need to keep the asm around.
    
    Backporting to stable kernels (4.6+) is needed to allow those to be built
    with future compilers as well.

    ARM: orion: fix orion_ge00_switch_board_info initialization
    
    commit 8337d083507b9827dfb36d545538b7789df834fd upstream.
    
    A section type mismatch warning shows up when building with LTO,
    since orion_ge00_mvmdio_bus_name was put in __initconst but not marked
    const itself:
    
    include/linux/of.h: In function 'spear_setup_of_timer':
    arch/arm/mach-spear/time.c:207:34: error: 'timer_of_match' causes a section type conflict with 'orion_ge00_mvmdio_bus_name'
     static const struct of_device_id timer_of_match[] __initconst = {
                                      ^
    arch/arm/plat-orion/common.c:475:32: note: 'orion_ge00_mvmdio_bus_name' was declared here
     static __initconst const char *orion_ge00_mvmdio_bus_name = "orion-mii";
                                    ^
    
    As pointed out by Andrew Lunn, it should in fact be 'const' but not
    '__initconst' because the string is never copied but may be accessed
    after the init sections are freed. To fix that, I get rid of the
    extra symbol and rewrite the initialization in a simpler way that
    assigns both the bus_id and modalias statically.
    
    I spotted another theoretical bug in the same place, where d->netdev[i]
    may be an out of bounds access, this can be fixed by moving the device
    assignment into the loop.

    Just like pte_{set,clear}_flags() their PMD and PUD counterparts should

    nospec: Allow index argument to have const-qualified type
    
    commit b98c6a160a057d5686a8c54c79cc6c8c94a7d0c8 upstream.
    
    The last expression in a statement expression need not be a bare
    variable, quoting gcc docs
    
      The last thing in the compound statement should be an expression
      followed by a semicolon; the value of this subexpression serves as the
      value of the entire construct.
    
    and we already use that in e.g. the min/max macros which end with a
    ternary expression.
    
    This way, we can allow index to have const-qualified type, which will in
    some cases avoid the need for introducing a local copy of index of
    non-const qualified type. That, in turn, can prevent readers not
    familiar with the internals of array_index_nospec from wondering about
    the seemingly redundant extra variable, and I think that's worthwhile
    considering how confusing the whole _nospec business is.
    
    The expression _i&_mask has type unsigned long (since that is the type
    of _mask, and the BUILD_BUG_ONs guarantee that _i will get promoted to
    that), so in order not to change the type of the whole expression, add
    a cast back to typeof(_i).

    KVM: s390: consider epoch index on TOD clock syncs
    
    commit 1575767ef3cf5326701d2ae3075b7732cbc855e4 upstream.
    
    For now, we don't take care of over/underflows. Especially underflows
    are critical:
    
    Assume the epoch is currently 0 and we get a sync request for delta=1,
    meaning the TOD is moved forward by 1 and we have to fix it up by
    subtracting 1 from the epoch. Right now, this will leave the epoch
    index untouched, resulting in epoch=-1, epoch_idx=0, which is wrong.
    
    We have to take care of over and underflows, also for the VSIE case. So
    let's factor out calculation into a separate function.

    KVM: s390: provide only a single function for setting the tod (fix SCK)
    
    commit 0e7def5fb0dc53ddbb9f62a497d15f1e11ccdc36 upstream.
    
    Right now, SET CLOCK called in the guest does not properly take care of
    the epoch index, as the call goes via the old kvm_s390_set_tod_clock()
    interface. So the epoch index is neither reset to 0, if required, nor
    properly set to e.g. 0xff on negative values.
    
    Fix this by providing a single kvm_s390_set_tod_clock() function. Move
    Multiple-epoch facility handling into it.

    EDAC, sb_edac: Fix out of bound writes during DIMM configuration on KNL
    
    commit bf8486709ac7fad99e4040dea73fe466c57a4ae1 upstream.
    
    Commit
    
      3286d3eb906c ("EDAC, sb_edac: Drop NUM_CHANNELS from 8 back to 4")
    
    decreased NUM_CHANNELS from 8 to 4, but this is not enough for Knights
    Landing which supports up to 6 channels.
    
    This caused out-of-bounds writes to pvt->mirror_mode and pvt->tolm
    variables which don't pay critical role on KNL code path, so the memory
    corruption wasn't causing any visible driver failures.
    
    The easiest way of fixing it is to change NUM_CHANNELS to 6. Do that.
    
    An alternative solution would be to restructure the KNL part of the
    driver to 2MC/3channel representation.

    blk-mq: don't call io sched's .requeue_request when requeueing rq to ->dispatch
    
    commit 105976f517791aed3b11f8f53b308a2069d42055 upstream.
    
    __blk_mq_requeue_request() covers two cases:
    
    - one is that the requeued request is added to hctx->dispatch, such as
    blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list()
    
    - another case is that the request is requeued to io scheduler, such as
    blk_mq_requeue_request().
    
    We should call io sched's .requeue_request callback only for the 2nd
    case.

    While the patch could detect more spurious timeouts, it could cause
    poor TCP performance on broken middle-boxes that modifies TCP packets
    (e.g. receive window, SACK options). Since the performance gain is
    much smaller compared to the potential loss. The best solution is
    to fully revert the change.

    s390/qeth: fix IPA command submission race
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d22ffb5a712f9211ffd104c38fc17cbfb1b5e2b0 ]
    
    If multiple IPA commands are build & sent out concurrently,
    fill_ipacmd_header() may assign a seqno value to a command that's
    different from what send_control_data() later assigns to this command's
    reply.
    This is due to other commands passing through send_control_data(),
    and incrementing card->seqno.ipa along the way.
    
    So one IPA command has no reply that's waiting for its seqno, while some
    other IPA command has multiple reply objects waiting for it.
    Only one of those waiting replies wins, and the other(s) times out and
    triggers a recovery via send_ipa_cmd().
    
    Fix this by making sure that the same seqno value is assigned to
    a command and its reply object.
    Do so immediately before submitting the command & while holding the
    irq_pending "lock", to produce nicely ascending seqnos.
    
    As a side effect, *all* IPA commands now use a reply object that's
    waiting for its actual seqno. Previously, early IPA commands that were
    submitted while the card was still DOWN used the "catch-all" IDX seqno.

    s390/qeth: fix IP address lookup for L3 devices
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c5c48c58b259bb8f0482398370ee539d7a12df3e ]
    
    Current code ("qeth_l3_ip_from_hash()") matches a queried address object
    against objects in the IP table by IP address, Mask/Prefix Length and
    MAC address ("qeth_l3_ipaddrs_is_equal()"). But what callers actually
    require is either
    a) "is this IP address registered" (ie. match by IP address only),
    before adding a new address.
    b) or "is this address object registered" (ie. match all relevant
       attributes), before deleting an address.
    
    Right now
    1. the ADD path is too strict in its lookup, and eg. doesn't detect
    conflicts between an existing NORMAL address and a new VIPA address
    (because the NORMAL address will have mask != 0, while VIPA has
    a mask == 0),
    2. the DELETE path is not strict enough, and eg. allows del_rxip() to
    delete a VIPA address as long as the IP address matches.
    
    Fix all this by adding helpers (_addr_match_ip() and _addr_match_all())
    that do the appropriate checking.
    
    Note that the ADD path for NORMAL addresses is special, as qeth keeps
    track of how many times such an address is in use (and there is no
    immediate way of returning errors to the caller). So when a requested
    NORMAL address _fully_ matches an existing one, it's not considered a
    conflict and we merely increment the refcount.

    [ Upstream commit 4964c66fd49b2e2342da35358f2ff74614bcbaee ]
    
    This reverts commit cb816192d986f7596009dedcf2201fe2e5bc2aa7.
    
    The issue this attempted to fix never actually occurs.
    l3_add_rxip() checks (via l3_ip_from_hash()) if the requested address
    was previously added to the card. If so, it returns -EEXIST and doesn't
    call l3_add_ip().
    As a result, the "address exists" path in l3_add_ip() is never taken
    for rxip addresses, and this patch had no effect.

    s390/qeth: fix double-free on IP add/remove race
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 14d066c3531a87f727968cacd85bd95c75f59843 ]
    
    Registering an IPv4 address with the HW takes quite a while, so we
    temporarily drop the ip_htable lock. Any concurrent add/remove of the
    same IP adjusts the IP's use count, and (on remove) is then blocked by
    addr->in_progress.
    After the register call has completed, we check the use count for
    concurrently attempted add/remove calls - and possibly straight-away
    deregister the IP again. This happens via l3_delete_ip(), which
    1) looks up the queried IP in the htable (getting a reference to the
       *same* queried object),
    2) deregisters the IP from the HW, and
    3) frees the IP object.
    
    The caller in l3_add_ip() then does a second free on the same object.
    
    For this case, skip all the extra checks and lookups in l3_delete_ip()
    and just deregister & free the IP object ourselves.

    s390/qeth: fix IP removal on offline cards
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 98d823ab1fbdcb13abc25b420f9bb71bade42056 ]
    
    If the HW is not reachable, then none of the IPs in qeth's internal
    table has been registered with the HW yet. So when deleting such an IP,
    there's no need to stage it for deregistration - just drop it from
    the table.
    
    This fixes the "add-delete-add" scenario on an offline card, where the
    the second "add" merely increments the IP's use count. But as the IP is
    still set to DISP_ADDR_DELETE from the previous "delete" step,
    l3_recover_ip() won't register it with the HW when the card goes online.

    s390/qeth: fix overestimated count of buffer elements
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 12472af89632beb1ed8dea29d4efe208ca05b06a ]
    
    qeth_get_elements_for_range() doesn't know how to handle a 0-length
    range (ie. start == end), and returns 1 when it should return 0.
    Such ranges occur on TSO skbs, where the L2/L3/L4 headers (and thus all
    of the skb's linear data) are skipped when mapping the skb into regular
    buffer elements.
    
    This overestimation may cause several performance-related issues:
    1. sub-optimal IO buffer selection, where the next buffer gets selected
       even though the skb would actually still fit into the current buffer.
    2. forced linearization, if the element count for a non-linear skb
       exceeds QETH_MAX_BUFFER_ELEMENTS.
    
    Rather than modifying qeth_get_elements_for_range() and adding overhead
    to every caller, fix up those callers that are in risk of passing a
    0-length range.

    [ Upstream commit 89271c65edd599207dd982007900506283c90ae3 ]
    
    For a memory range/skb where the last byte falls onto a page boundary
    (ie. 'end' is of the form xxx...xxx001), the PFN_UP() part of the
    calculation currently doesn't round up to the next PFN due to an
    off-by-one error.
    Thus qeth believes that the skb occupies one page less than it
    actually does, and may select a IO buffer that doesn't have enough spare
    buffer elements to fit all of the skb's data.
    HW detects this as a malformed buffer descriptor, and raises an
    exception which then triggers device recovery.

    l2tp: fix tunnel lookup use-after-free race
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 28f5bfb819195ad9c2eb9486babe7b0e4efe925f ]
    
    l2tp_tunnel_get walks the tunnel list to find a matching tunnel
    instance and if a match is found, its refcount is increased before
    returning the tunnel pointer. But when tunnel objects are destroyed,
    they are on the tunnel list after their refcount hits zero. Fix this
    by moving the code that removes the tunnel from the tunnel list from
    the tunnel socket destructor into in the l2tp_tunnel_delete path,
    before the tunnel refcount is decremented.
    
    refcount_t: increment on 0; use-after-free.

    l2tp: fix race in pppol2tp_release with session object destroy
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d02ba2a6110c530a32926af8ad441111774d2893 ]
    
    pppol2tp_release uses call_rcu to put the final ref on its socket. But
    the session object doesn't hold a ref on the session socket so may be
    freed while the pppol2tp_put_sk RCU callback is scheduled. Fix this by
    having the session hold a ref on its socket until the session is
    destroyed. It is this ref that is dropped via call_rcu.
    
    Sessions are also deleted via l2tp_tunnel_closeall. This must now also put
    the final ref via call_rcu. So move the call_rcu call site into
    pppol2tp_session_close so that this happens in both destroy paths. A
    common destroy path should really be implemented, perhaps with
    l2tp_tunnel_closeall calling l2tp_session_delete like pppol2tp_release
    does, but this will be looked at later.

    l2tp: fix races with tunnel socket close
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d00fa9adc528c1b0e64d532556764852df8bd7b9 ]
    
    The tunnel socket tunnel->sock (struct sock) is accessed when
    preparing a new ppp session on a tunnel at pppol2tp_session_init. If
    the socket is closed by a thread while another is creating a new
    session, the threads race. In pppol2tp_connect, the tunnel object may
    be created if the pppol2tp socket is associated with the special
    session_id 0 and the tunnel socket is looked up using the provided
    fd. When handling this, pppol2tp_connect cannot sock_hold the tunnel
    socket to prevent it being destroyed during pppol2tp_connect since
    this may itself may race with the socket being destroyed. Doing
    sockfd_lookup in pppol2tp_connect isn't sufficient to prevent
    tunnel->sock going away either because a given tunnel socket fd may be
    reused between calls to pppol2tp_connect. Instead, have
    l2tp_tunnel_create sock_hold the tunnel socket before it does
    sockfd_put. This ensures that the tunnel's socket is always extant
    while the tunnel object exists. Hold a ref on the socket until the
    tunnel is destroyed and ensure that all tunnel destroy paths go
    through a common function (l2tp_tunnel_delete) since this will do the
    final sock_put to release the tunnel socket.
    
    Since the tunnel's socket is now guaranteed to exist if the tunnel
    exists, we no longer need to use sockfd_lookup via l2tp_sock_to_tunnel
    to derive the tunnel from the socket since this is always
    sk_user_data.
    
    Also, sessions no longer sock_hold the tunnel socket since sessions
    already hold a tunnel ref and the tunnel sock will not be freed until
    the tunnel is freed. Removing these sock_holds in
    l2tp_session_register avoids a possible sock leak in the
    pppol2tp_connect error path if l2tp_session_register succeeds but
    attaching a ppp channel fails. The pppol2tp_connect error path could
    have been fixed instead and have the sock ref dropped when the session
    is freed, but doing a sock_put of the tunnel socket when the session
    is freed would require a new session_free callback. It is simpler to
    just remove the sock_hold of the tunnel socket in
    l2tp_session_register, now that the tunnel socket lifetime is
    guaranteed.
    
    Finally, some init code in l2tp_tunnel_create is reordered to ensure
    that the new tunnel object's refcount is set and the tunnel socket ref
    is taken before the tunnel socket destructor callbacks are set.

    l2tp: don't use inet_shutdown on ppp session destroy
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 225eb26489d05c679a4c4197ffcb81c81e9dcaf4 ]
    
    Previously, if a ppp session was closed, we called inet_shutdown to mark
    the socket as unconnected such that userspace would get errors and
    then close the socket. This could race with userspace closing the
    socket. Instead, leave userspace to close the socket in its own time
    (our session will be detached anyway).

    tcp: tracepoint: only call trace_tcp_send_reset with full socket
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c487bb9adddbc1d23433e09d2548759375c2b52 ]
    
    tracepoint tcp_send_reset requires a full socket to work. However, it
    may be called when in TCP_TIME_WAIT:
    
            case TCP_TW_RST:
                    tcp_v6_send_reset(sk, skb);
                    inet_twsk_deschedule_put(inet_twsk(sk));
                    goto discard_it;
    
    To avoid this problem, this patch checks the socket with sk_fullsock()
    before calling trace_tcp_send_reset().

    locking semantics for phy_resume() such that the caller now needs to
    hold the phy mutex. Not all call sites were adopted to this new
    semantic, resulting in warnings from the added
    WARN_ON(!mutex_is_locked(&phydev->lock)).  Rather than change the
    semantics, add a __phy_resume() and restore the old behavior of
    phy_resume().

    [ Upstream commit 4e09ff5362843dff3accfa84c805c7f3a99de9cd ]
    
    We try to disable NAPI to prevent a single XDP TX queue being used by
    multiple cpus. But we don't check if device is up (NAPI is enabled),
    this could result stall because of infinite wait in
    napi_disable(). Fixing this by checking device state through
    netif_running() before.

    tuntap: disable preemption during XDP processing
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 23e43f07f896f8578318cfcc9466f1e8b8ab21b6 ]
    
    Except for tuntap, all other drivers' XDP was implemented at NAPI
    poll() routine in a bh. This guarantees all XDP operation were done at
    the same CPU which is required by e.g BFP_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY. But
    for tuntap, we do it in process context and we try to protect XDP
    processing by RCU reader lock. This is insufficient since
    CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU can preempt the RCU reader critical section which
    breaks the assumption that all XDP were processed in the same CPU.
    
    Fixing this by simply disabling preemption during XDP processing.

    tuntap: correctly add the missing XDP flush
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1bb4f2e868a2891ab8bc668b8173d6ccb8c4ce6f ]
    
    We don't flush batched XDP packets through xdp_do_flush_map(), this
    will cause packets stall at TX queue. Consider we don't do XDP on NAPI
    poll(), the only possible fix is to call xdp_do_flush_map()
    immediately after xdp_do_redirect().
    
    Note, this in fact won't try to batch packets through devmap, we could
    address in the future.

    RFC 793 (page 70) and RFC 793-bis (page 64) both suggest
    purging the write queue upon RST:
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis-07
    
    Moreover, this is essential for a correct MSG_ZEROCOPY
    implementation, because userspace cannot call close(fd)
    before receiving zerocopy signals even when the connection
    is reset.

    netlink: put module reference if dump start fails
    
    
    [ Upstream commit b87b6194be631c94785fe93398651e804ed43e28 ]
    
    Before, if cb->start() failed, the module reference would never be put,
    because cb->cb_running is intentionally false at this point. Users are
    generally annoyed by this because they can no longer unload modules that
    leak references. Also, it may be possible to tediously wrap a reference
    counter back to zero, especially since module.c still uses atomic_inc
    instead of refcount_inc.
    
    This patch expands the error path to simply call module_put if
    cb->start() fails.

    mlxsw: spectrum_router: Do not unconditionally clear route offload indication
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d1c95af366961101819f07e3c64d44f3be7f0367 ]
    
    When mlxsw replaces (or deletes) a route it removes the offload
    indication from the replaced route. This is problematic for IPv4 routes,
    as the offload indication is stored in the fib_info which is usually
    shared between multiple routes.
    
    Instead of unconditionally clearing the offload indication, only clear
    it if no other route is using the fib_info.

    The problem is that the htnode is freed before the linked knodes and the
    latter will try to access the first at u32_destroy_key() time.
    This change addresses the issue using the htnode refcnt to guarantee
    the correct free order. While at it also add a RCU annotation,
    to keep sparse happy.
    
    v1 -> v2: use rtnl_derefence() instead of RCU read locks
    v2 -> v3:
      - don't check refcnt in u32_destroy_hnode()
      - cleaned-up u32_destroy() implementation
      - cleaned-up code comment
    v3 -> v4:
      - dropped unneeded comment

    tls: Use correct sk->sk_prot for IPV6
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c113187d38ff85dc302a1bb55864b203ebb2ba10 ]
    
    The tls ulp overrides sk->prot with a new tls specific proto structs.
    The tls specific structs were previously based on the ipv4 specific
    tcp_prot sturct.
    As a result, attaching the tls ulp to an ipv6 tcp socket replaced
    some ipv6 callback with the ipv4 equivalents.
    
    This patch adds ipv6 tls proto structs and uses them when
    attached to ipv6 sockets.

    [ Upstream commit f600c6088018d1dbc5777d18daa83660f7ea4a64 ]
    
    Driver tries to copy at least MLX5E_MIN_INLINE bytes into the control
    segment of the WQE. It assumes that the linear part contains at least
    MLX5E_MIN_INLINE bytes, which can be wrong.
    
    Cited commit verified that driver will not copy more bytes into the
    inline header part that the actual size of the packet. Re-factor this
    check to make sure we do not exceed the linear part as well.
    
    This fix is aligned with the current driver's assumption that the entire
    L2 will be present in the linear part of the SKB.

    [ Upstream commit 0e5a82efda872c2469c210957d7d4161ef8f4391 ]
    
    When a VLAN is added on a port, a reference is taken on the
    corresponding master VLAN entry. If it does not already exist, then it
    is created and a reference taken.
    
    However, in the second case a reference is not really taken when
    CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL is enabled as refcount_inc() is replaced by
    refcount_inc_not_zero().
    
    Fix this by using refcount_set() on a newly created master VLAN entry.

    [ Upstream commit 0f2d2b2736b08dafa3bde31d048750fbc8df3a31 ]
    
    Since mlxsw_sp_fib_create() and mlxsw_sp_mr_table_create()
    use ERR_PTR macro to propagate int err through return of a pointer,
    the return value is not NULL in case of failure. So if one
    of the calls fails, one of vr->fib4, vr->fib6 or vr->mr4_table
    is not NULL and mlxsw_sp_vr_is_used wrongly assumes
    that vr is in use which leads to crash like following one:

    net/sched: cls_u32: fix cls_u32 on filter replace
    
    
    [ Upstream commit eb53f7af6f15285e2f6ada97285395343ce9f433 ]
    
    The following sequence is currently broken:
    
     # tc qdisc add dev foo ingress
     # tc filter replace dev foo protocol all ingress \
       u32 match u8 0 0 action mirred egress mirror dev bar1
     # tc filter replace dev foo protocol all ingress \
       handle 800::800 pref 49152 \
       u32 match u8 0 0 action mirred egress mirror dev bar2
     Error: cls_u32: Key node flags do not match passed flags.
     We have an error talking to the kernel, -1
    
    The error comes from u32_change() when comparing new and
    existing flags. The existing ones always contains one of
    TCA_CLS_FLAGS_{,NOT}_IN_HW flag depending on offloading state.
    These flags cannot be passed from userspace so the condition
    (n->flags != flags) in u32_change() always fails.
    
    Fix the condition so the flags TCA_CLS_FLAGS_NOT_IN_HW and
    TCA_CLS_FLAGS_IN_HW are not taken into account.

    pfifo_fast got percpu stats lately, uncovering a bug I introduced last
    year in linux-4.10.
    
    I missed the fact that we have to clear our temporary storage
    before calling __gnet_stats_copy_basic() in the case of percpu stats.
    
    Without this fix, rate estimators (tc qd replace dev xxx root est 1sec
    4sec pfifo_fast) are utterly broken.

    tcp_bbr: better deal with suboptimal GSO
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 350c9f484bde93ef229682eedd98cd5f74350f7f ]
    
    BBR uses tcp_tso_autosize() in an attempt to probe what would be the
    burst sizes and to adjust cwnd in bbr_target_cwnd() with following
    gold formula :
    
    /* Allow enough full-sized skbs in flight to utilize end systems. */
    cwnd += 3 * bbr->tso_segs_goal;
    
    But GSO can be lacking or be constrained to very small
    units (ip link set dev ... gso_max_segs 2)
    
    What we really want is to have enough packets in flight so that both
    GSO and GRO are efficient.
    
    So in the case GSO is off or downgraded, we still want to have the same
    number of packets in flight as if GSO/TSO was fully operational, so
    that GRO can hopefully be working efficiently.
    
    To fix this issue, we make tcp_tso_autosize() unaware of
    sk->sk_gso_max_segs
    
    Only tcp_tso_segs() has to enforce the gso_max_segs limit.
    
    Tested:
    
    ethtool -K eth0 tso off gso off
    tc qd replace dev eth0 root pfifo_fast
    
    Before patch:
    for f in {1..5}; do ./super_netperf 1 -H lpaa24 -- -K bbr; done
        691  (ss -temoi shows cwnd is stuck around 6 )

    [ Upstream commit 4a31a6b19f9ddf498c81f5c9b089742b7472a6f8 ]
    
    Fix dst reference count leak in sctp_v4_get_dst() introduced in commit
    410f03831 ("sctp: add routing output fallback"):
    
    When walking the address_list, successive ip_route_output_key() calls
    may return the same rt->dst with the reference incremented on each call.
    
    The code would not decrement the dst refcount when the dst pointer was
    identical from the previous iteration, causing the dst refcnt leak.

      ip link add dummy0 type dummy
      ip link add dummy1 type dummy
      ip link add dummy2 type dummy

    net/mlx5e: Fix TCP checksum in LRO buffers
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 8babd44d2079079f9d5a4aca7005aed80236efe0 ]
    
    When receiving an LRO packet, the checksum field is set by the hardware
    to the checksum of the first coalesced packet. Obviously, this checksum
    is not valid for the merged LRO packet and should be fixed.  We can use
    the CQE checksum which covers the checksum of the entire merged packet
    TCP payload to help us calculate the checksum incrementally.
    
    Tested by sending IPv4/6 traffic with LRO enabled, RX checksum disabled
    and watching nstat checksum error counters (in addition to the obvious
    bandwidth drop caused by checksum errors).
    
    This bug is usually "hidden" since LRO packets would go through the
    CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY flow which does not validate the packet checksum.
    
    It's important to note that previous to this patch, LRO packets provided
    with CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY are indeed packets with a correct validated
    checksum (even though the checksum inside the TCP header is incorrect),
    since the hardware LRO aggregation is terminated upon receiving a packet
    with bad checksum.

    udplite: fix partial checksum initialization
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 15f35d49c93f4fa9875235e7bf3e3783d2dd7a1b ]
    
    Since UDP-Lite is always using checksum, the following path is
    triggered when calculating pseudo header for it:
    
      udp4_csum_init() or udp6_csum_init()
        skb_checksum_init_zero_check()
          __skb_checksum_validate_complete()
    
    The problem can appear if skb->len is less than CHECKSUM_BREAK. In
    this particular case __skb_checksum_validate_complete() also invokes
    __skb_checksum_complete(skb). If UDP-Lite is using partial checksum
    that covers only part of a packet, the function will return bad
    checksum and the packet will be dropped.
    
    It can be fixed if we skip skb_checksum_init_zero_check() and only
    set the required pseudo header checksum for UDP-Lite with partial
    checksum before udp4_csum_init()/udp6_csum_init() functions return.

    Here the chunk size for INIT_ACK packet becomes too big, mostly
    because of the state cookie (INIT packet has large size with
    many address parameters), plus additional server parameters.
    
    Later this chunk causes the panic in skb_put_data():
    
      skb_packet_transmit()
          sctp_packet_pack()
              skb_put_data(nskb, chunk->skb->data, chunk->skb->len);
    
    'nskb' (head skb) was previously allocated with packet->size
    from u16 'chunk->chunk_hdr->length'.
    
    As suggested by Marcelo we should check the chunk's length in
    _sctp_make_chunk() before trying to allocate skb for it and
    discard a chunk if its size bigger than SCTP_MAX_CHUNK_LEN.

    ppp: prevent unregistered channels from connecting to PPP units
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 77f840e3e5f09c6d7d727e85e6e08276dd813d11 ]
    
    PPP units don't hold any reference on the channels connected to it.
    It is the channel's responsibility to ensure that it disconnects from
    its unit before being destroyed.
    In practice, this is ensured by ppp_unregister_channel() disconnecting
    the channel from the unit before dropping a reference on the channel.
    
    However, it is possible for an unregistered channel to connect to a PPP
    unit: register a channel with ppp_register_net_channel(), attach a
    /dev/ppp file to it with ioctl(PPPIOCATTCHAN), unregister the channel
    with ppp_unregister_channel() and finally connect the /dev/ppp file to
    a PPP unit with ioctl(PPPIOCCONNECT).
    
    Once in this situation, the channel is only held by the /dev/ppp file,
    which can be released at anytime and free the channel without letting
    the parent PPP unit know. Then the ppp structure ends up with dangling
    pointers in its ->channels list.
    
    Prevent this scenario by forbidding unregistered channels from
    connecting to PPP units. This maintains the code logic by keeping
    ppp_unregister_channel() responsible from disconnecting the channel if
    necessary and avoids modification on the reference counting mechanism.
    
    This issue seems to predate git history (successfully reproduced on
    Linux 2.6.26 and earlier PPP commits are unrelated).

    net: sched: report if filter is too large to dump
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ae437ad5a2ed573b1ebb04e0afa70b8869f88dd ]
    
    So far, if the filter was too large to fit in the allocated skb, the
    kernel did not return any error and stopped dumping. Modify the dumper
    so that it returns -EMSGSIZE when a filter fails to dump and it is the
    first filter in the skb. If we are not first, we will get a next chance
    with more room.
    
    I understand this is pretty near to being an API change, but the
    original design (silent truncation) can be considered a bug.
    
    Note: The error case can happen pretty easily if you create a filter
    with 32 actions and have 4kb pages. Also recent versions of iproute try
    to be clever with their buffer allocation size, which in turn leads to

    [ Upstream commit cb9f7a9a5c96a773bbc9c70660dc600cfff82f82 ]
    
    Nowadays, nlmsg_multicast() returns only 0 or -ESRCH but this was not the
    case when commit 134e63756d5f was pushed.
    However, there was no reason to stop the loop if a netns does not have
    listeners.
    Returns -ESRCH only if there was no listeners in all netns.
    
    To avoid having the same problem in the future, I didn't take the
    assumption that nlmsg_multicast() returns only 0 or -ESRCH.

    net: ipv4: don't allow setting net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu below 68
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c7272c2f1229125f74f22dcdd59de9bbd804f1c8 ]
    
    According to RFC 1191 sections 3 and 4, ICMP frag-needed messages
    indicating an MTU below 68 should be rejected:
    
        A host MUST never reduce its estimate of the Path MTU below 68
        octets.
    
    and (talking about ICMP frag-needed's Next-Hop MTU field):
    
        This field will never contain a value less than 68, since every
        router "must be able to forward a datagram of 68 octets without
        fragmentation".
    
    Furthermore, by letting net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu be set to negative
    values, we can end up with a very large PMTU when (-1) is cast into u32.
    
    Let's also make ip_rt_min_pmtu a u32, since it's only ever compared to
    unsigned ints.

    net: fix race on decreasing number of TX queues
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ac5b70198adc25c73fba28de4f78adcee8f6be0b ]
    
    netif_set_real_num_tx_queues() can be called when netdev is up.
    That usually happens when user requests change of number of
    channels/rings with ethtool -L.  The procedure for changing
    the number of queues involves resetting the qdiscs and setting
    dev->num_tx_queues to the new value.  When the new value is
    lower than the old one, extra care has to be taken to ensure
    ordering of accesses to the number of queues vs qdisc reset.
    
    Currently the queues are reset before new dev->num_tx_queues
    is assigned, leaving a window of time where packets can be
    enqueued onto the queues going down, leading to a likely
    crash in the drivers, since most drivers don't check if TX
    skbs are assigned to an active queue.

    net: ethernet: ti: cpsw: fix net watchdog timeout
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 62f94c2101f35cd45775df00ba09bde77580e26a ]
    
    It was discovered that simple program which indefinitely sends 200b UDP
    packets and runs on TI AM574x SoC (SMP) under RT Kernel triggers network
    watchdog timeout in TI CPSW driver (<6 hours run). The network watchdog
    timeout is triggered due to race between cpsw_ndo_start_xmit() and
    cpsw_tx_handler() [NAPI]
    
    cpsw_ndo_start_xmit()
            if (unlikely(!cpdma_check_free_tx_desc(txch))) {
                    txq = netdev_get_tx_queue(ndev, q_idx);
                    netif_tx_stop_queue(txq);
    
    ^^ as per [1] barier has to be used after set_bit() otherwise new value
    might not be visible to other cpus
            }
    
    cpsw_tx_handler()
            if (unlikely(netif_tx_queue_stopped(txq)))
                    netif_tx_wake_queue(txq);
    
    and when it happens ndev TX queue became disabled forever while driver's HW
    TX queue is empty.
    
    Fix this, by adding smp_mb__after_atomic() after netif_tx_stop_queue()
    calls and double check for free TX descriptors after stopping ndev TX queue
    - if there are free TX descriptors wake up ndev TX queue.

    ipv6 sit: work around bogus gcc-8 -Wrestrict warning
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ca79bec237f5809a7c3c59bd41cd0880aa889966 ]
    
    gcc-8 has a new warning that detects overlapping input and output arguments
    in memcpy(). It triggers for sit_init_net() calling ipip6_tunnel_clone_6rd(),
    which is actually correct:
    
    net/ipv6/sit.c: In function 'sit_init_net':
    net/ipv6/sit.c:192:3: error: 'memcpy' source argument is the same as destination [-Werror=restrict]
    
    The problem here is that the logic detecting the memcpy() arguments finds them
    to be the same, but the conditional that tests for the input and output of
    ipip6_tunnel_clone_6rd() to be identical is not a compile-time constant.
    
    We know that netdev_priv(t->dev) is the same as t for a tunnel device,
    and comparing "dev" directly here lets the compiler figure out as well
    that 'dev == sitn->fb_tunnel_dev' when called from sit_init_net(), so
    it no longer warns.
    
    This code is old, so Cc stable to make sure that we don't get the warning
    for older kernels built with new gcc.

    fib_semantics: Don't match route with mismatching tclassid
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a8c6db1dfd1b1d18359241372bb204054f2c3174 ]
    
    In fib_nh_match(), if output interface or gateway are passed in
    the FIB configuration, we don't have to check next hops of
    multipath routes to conclude whether we have a match or not.
    
    However, we might still have routes with different realms
    matching the same output interface and gateway configuration,
    and this needs to cause the match to fail. Otherwise the first
    route inserted in the FIB will match, regardless of the realms:
    
     # ip route add 1.1.1.1 dev eth0 table 1234 realms 1/2
     # ip route append 1.1.1.1 dev eth0 table 1234 realms 3/4
     # ip route list table 1234
     1.1.1.1 dev eth0 scope link realms 1/2
     1.1.1.1 dev eth0 scope link realms 3/4
     # ip route del 1.1.1.1 dev ens3 table 1234 realms 3/4
     # ip route list table 1234
     1.1.1.1 dev ens3 scope link realms 3/4
    
    whereas route with realms 3/4 should have been deleted instead.
    
    Explicitly check for fc_flow passed in the FIB configuration
    (this comes from RTA_FLOW extracted by rtm_to_fib_config()) and
    fail matching if it differs from nh_tclassid.
    
    The handling of RTA_FLOW for multipath routes later in
    fib_nh_match() is still needed, as we can have multiple RTA_FLOW
    attributes that need to be matched against the tclassid of each
    next hop.
    
    v2: Check that fc_flow is set before discarding the match, so
        that the user can still select the first matching rule by
        not specifying any realm, as suggested by David Ahern.

    x86/cpu_entry_area: Sync cpu_entry_area to initial_page_table
    
    commit 945fd17ab6bab8a4d05da6c3170519fbcfe62ddb upstream.
    
    The separation of the cpu_entry_area from the fixmap missed the fact that
    on 32bit non-PAE kernels the cpu_entry_area mapping might not be covered in
    initial_page_table by the previous synchronizations.
    
    This results in suspend/resume failures because 32bit utilizes initial page
    table for resume. The absence of the cpu_entry_area mapping results in a
    triple fault, aka. insta reboot.
    
    With PAE enabled this works by chance because the PGD entry which covers
    the fixmap and other parts incindentally provides the cpu_entry_area
    mapping as well.
    
    Synchronize the initial page table after setting up the cpu entry
    area. Instead of adding yet another copy of the same code, move it to a
    function and invoke it from the various places.
    
    It needs to be investigated if the existing calls in setup_arch() and
    setup_per_cpu_areas() can be replaced by the later invocation from
    setup_cpu_entry_areas(), but that's beyond the scope of this fix.

    x86/platform/intel-mid: Handle Intel Edison reboot correctly
    
    commit 028091f82eefd5e84f81cef81a7673016ecbe78b upstream.
    
    When the Intel Edison module is powered with 3.3V, the reboot command makes
    the module stuck.  If the module is powered at a greater voltage, like 4.4V
    (as the Edison Mini Breakout board does), reboot works OK.
    
    The official Intel Edison BSP sends the IPCMSG_COLD_RESET message to the
    SCU by default. The IPCMSG_COLD_BOOT which is used by the upstream kernel
    is only sent when explicitely selected on the kernel command line.
    
    Use IPCMSG_COLD_RESET unconditionally which makes reboot work independent
    of the power supply voltage.

    direct-io: Fix sleep in atomic due to sync AIO
    
    commit d9c10e5b8863cfb6886d1640386455075c6e979d upstream.
    
    Commit e864f39569f4 "fs: add RWF_DSYNC aand RWF_SYNC" added additional
    way for direct IO to become synchronous and thus trigger fsync from the
    IO completion handler. Then commit 9830f4be159b "fs: Use RWF_* flags for
    AIO operations" allowed these flags to be set for AIO as well. However
    that commit forgot to update the condition checking whether the IO
    completion handling should be defered to a workqueue and thus AIO DIO
    with RWF_[D]SYNC set will call fsync() from IRQ context resulting in
    sleep in atomic.
    
    Fix the problem by checking directly iocb flags (the same way as it is
    done in dio_complete()) instead of checking all conditions that could
    lead to IO being synchronous.

    vfio: disable filesystem-dax page pinning
    
    commit 94db151dc89262bfa82922c44e8320cea2334667 upstream.
    
    Filesystem-DAX is incompatible with 'longterm' page pinning. Without
    page cache indirection a DAX mapping maps filesystem blocks directly.
    This means that the filesystem must not modify a file's block map while
    any page in a mapping is pinned. In order to prevent the situation of
    userspace holding of filesystem operations indefinitely, disallow
    'longterm' Filesystem-DAX mappings.
    
    RDMA has the same conflict and the plan there is to add a 'with lease'
    mechanism to allow the kernel to notify userspace that the mapping is
    being torn down for block-map maintenance. Perhaps something similar can
    be put in place for vfio.
    
    Note that xfs and ext4 still report:
    
       "DAX enabled. Warning: EXPERIMENTAL, use at your own risk"
    
    ...at mount time, and resolving the dax-dma-vs-truncate problem is one
    of the last hurdles to remove that designation.

    btrfs: use proper endianness accessors for super_copy
    
    commit 3c181c12c431fe33b669410d663beb9cceefcd1b upstream.
    
    The fs_info::super_copy is a byte copy of the on-disk structure and all
    members must use the accessor macros/functions to obtain the right
    value.  This was missing in update_super_roots and in sysfs readers.
    
    Moving between opposite endianness hosts will report bogus numbers in
    sysfs, and mount may fail as the root will not be restored correctly. If
    the filesystem is always used on a same endian host, this will not be a
    problem.
    
    Fix this by using the btrfs_set_super...() functions to set
    fs_info::super_copy values, and for the sysfs, use the cached
    fs_info::nodesize/sectorsize values.

    parisc: Fix ordering of cache and TLB flushes
    
    commit 0adb24e03a124b79130c9499731936b11ce2677d upstream.
    
    The change to flush_kernel_vmap_range() wasn't sufficient to avoid the
    SMP stalls.  The problem is some drivers call these routines with
    interrupts disabled.  Interrupts need to be enabled for flush_tlb_all()
    and flush_cache_all() to work.  This version adds checks to ensure
    interrupts are not disabled before calling routines that need IPI
    interrupts.  When interrupts are disabled, we now drop into slower code.
    
    The attached change fixes the ordering of cache and TLB flushes in
    several cases.  When we flush the cache using the existing PTE/TLB
    entries, we need to flush the TLB after doing the cache flush.  We don't
    need to do this when we flush the entire instruction and data caches as
    these flushes don't use the existing TLB entries.  The same is true for
    tmpalias region flushes.
    
    The flush_kernel_vmap_range() and invalidate_kernel_vmap_range()
    routines have been updated.
    
    Secondly, we added a new purge_kernel_dcache_range_asm() routine to
    pacache.S and use it in invalidate_kernel_vmap_range().  Nominally,
    purges are faster than flushes as the cache lines don't have to be
    written back to memory.
    
    Hopefully, this is sufficient to resolve the remaining problems due to
    cache speculation.  So far, testing indicates that this is the case.  I
    did work up a patch using tmpalias flushes, but there is a performance
    hit because we need the physical address for each page, and we also need
    to sequence access to the tmpalias flush code.  This increases the
    probability of stalls.

    When run under QEMU, calling mfctl(16) creates some overhead because the

    Additionally, increase the minimal time interval to 8000 cycles instead
    of 500 to compensate possible QEMU delays when delivering interrupts.

    timers: Forward timer base before migrating timers
    
    commit c52232a49e203a65a6e1a670cd5262f59e9364a0 upstream.
    
    On CPU hotunplug the enqueued timers of the unplugged CPU are migrated to a
    live CPU. This happens from the control thread which initiated the unplug.
    
    If the CPU on which the control thread runs came out from a longer idle
    period then the base clock of that CPU might be stale because the control
    thread runs prior to any event which forwards the clock.
    
    In such a case the timers from the unplugged CPU are queued on the live CPU
    based on the stale clock which can cause large delays due to increased
    granularity of the outer timer wheels which are far away from base:;clock.
    
    But there is a worse problem than that. The following sequence of events
    illustrates it:
    
     - CPU0 timer1 is queued expires = 59969 and base->clk = 59131.
    
       The timer is queued at wheel level 2, with resulting expiry time = 60032
       (due to level granularity).
    
     - CPU1 enters idle @60007, with next timer expiry @60020.
    
     - CPU0 is hotplugged at @60009
    
     - CPU1 exits idle and runs the control thread which migrates the
       timers from CPU0
    
       timer1 is now queued in level 0 for immediate handling in the next
       softirq because the requested expiry time 59969 is before CPU1 base->clk
       60007
    
     - CPU1 runs code which forwards the base clock which succeeds because the
       next expiring timer. which was collected at idle entry time is still set
       to 60020.
    
       So it forwards beyond 60007 and therefore misses to expire the migrated
       timer1. That timer gets expired when the wheel wraps around again, which
       takes between 63 and 630ms depending on the HZ setting.
    
    Address both problems by invoking forward_timer_base() for the control CPUs
    timer base. All other places, which might run into a similar problem
    (mod_timer()/add_timer_on()) already invoke forward_timer_base() to avoid
    that.

    mmc: sdhci-pci: Fix S0i3 for Intel BYT-based controllers
    
    commit f8870ae6e2d6be75b1accc2db981169fdfbea7ab upstream.
    
    Tuning can leave the IP in an active state (Buffer Read Enable bit set)
    which prevents the entry to low power states (i.e. S0i3). Data reset will
    clear it.
    
    Generally tuning is followed by a data transfer which will anyway sort out
    the state, so it is rare that S0i3 is actually prevented.

    ALSA: hda - Fix pincfg at resume on Lenovo T470 dock
    
    commit 71db96ddfa72671bd43cacdcc99ca178d90ba267 upstream.
    
    We've added a quirk to enable the recent Lenovo dock support, where it
    overwrites the pin configs of NID 0x17 and 19, not only updating the
    pin config cache.  It works right after the boot, but the problem is
    that the pin configs are occasionally cleared when the machine goes to
    PM.  Meanwhile the quirk writes the pin configs only at the pre-probe,
    so this won't be applied any longer.
    
    For addressing that issue, this patch moves the code to overwrite the
    pin configs into HDA_FIXUP_ACT_INIT section so that it's always
    applied at both probe and resume time.

    ALSA: hda: Add a power_save blacklist
    
    commit 1ba8f9d308174e647b864c36209b4d7934d99888 upstream.
    
    On some boards setting power_save to a non 0 value leads to clicking /
    popping sounds when ever we enter/leave powersaving mode. Ideally we would
    figure out how to avoid these sounds, but that is not always feasible.
    
    This commit adds a blacklist for devices where powersaving is known to
    cause problems and disables it on these devices.
    
    Note I tried to put this blacklist in userspace first:
    https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/8128
    
    But the systemd maintainers rightfully pointed out that it would be
    impossible to then later remove entries once we actually find a way to
    make power-saving work on listed boards without issues. Having this list
    in the kernel will allow removal of the blacklist entry in the same commit
    which fixes the clicks / plops.
    
    The blacklist only applies to the default power_save module-option value,
    if a user explicitly sets the module-option then the blacklist is not
    used.

    ALSA: control: Fix memory corruption risk in snd_ctl_elem_read
    
    commit 5a23699a39abc5328921a81b89383d088f6ba9cc upstream.
    
    The patch "ALSA: control: code refactoring for ELEM_READ/ELEM_WRITE
    operations" introduced a potential for kernel memory corruption due
    to an incorrect if statement allowing non-readable controls to fall
    through and call the get function. For TLV controls a driver can omit
    SNDRV_CTL_ELEM_ACCESS_READ to ensure that only the TLV get function
    can be called. Instead the normal get() can be invoked unexpectedly
    and as the driver expects that this will only be called for controls
    <= 512 bytes, potentially try to copy >512 bytes into the 512 byte
    return array, so corrupting kernel memory.
    
    The problem is an attempt to refactor the snd_ctl_elem_read function
    to invert the logic so that it conditionally aborted if the control
    is unreadable instead of conditionally executing. But the if statement
    wasn't inverted correctly.
    
    The correct inversion of
    
        if (a && !b)
    
    is
        if (!a || b)

    Discrete TPMs are often connected over slow serial buses which, on

    driver _recv() functions, we need to use a u32 to unmarshal the
    response size, otherwise a bit flip of the 31st bit would cause the
    expected variable to go negative, which would then try to read a huge
    amount of data.  Also sanity check that the expected amount of data is
    large enough for the TPM header.

    Bluetooth: btusb: Use DMI matching for QCA reset_resume quirking
    
    commit 1fdb926974695d3dbc05a429bafa266fdd16510e upstream.
    
    Commit 61f5acea8737 ("Bluetooth: btusb: Restore QCA Rome suspend/resume fix
    with a "rewritten" version") applied the USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME to all QCA
    USB Bluetooth modules. But it turns out that the resume problems are not
    caused by the QCA Rome chipset, on most platforms it resumes fine. The
    resume problems are actually a platform problem (likely the platform
    cutting all power when suspended).
    
    The USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME quirk also disables runtime suspend, so by
    matching on usb-ids, we're causing all boards with these chips to use extra
    power, to fix resume problems which only happen on some boards.
    
    This commit fixes this by applying the quirk based on DMI matching instead
    of on usb-ids, so that we match the platform and not the chipset.
    
    Here is the /sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices for the Bluetooth module:

    powerpc/pseries: Enable RAS hotplug events later
    
    commit c9dccf1d074a67d36c510845f663980d69e3409b upstream.
    
    Currently if the kernel receives a memory hot-unplug event early
    enough, it may get stuck in an infinite loop in
    dissolve_free_huge_pages(). This appears as a stall just after:
    
      pseries-hotplug-mem: Attempting to hot-remove XX LMB(s) at YYYYYYYY
    
    It appears to be caused by "minimum_order" being uninitialized, due to
    init_ras_IRQ() executing before hugetlb_init().
    
    To correct this, extract the part of init_ras_IRQ() that enables
    hotplug event processing and place it in the machine_late_initcall
    phase, which is guaranteed to be after hugetlb_init() is called.

    platform/x86: dell-laptop: Allocate buffer on heap rather than globally
    
    commit 9862b43624a5450a097cc4122732857b869dbbca upstream.
    
    There is no longer a need for the buffer to be defined in
    first 4GB physical address space.
    
    Furthermore there may be race conditions with multiple different functions
    working on a module wide buffer causing incorrect results.

    ipmi_si: Fix error handling of platform device
    
    commit 174134ac760275457bb0d1560a0dbe6cf8a12ad6 upstream.
    
    Cleanup of platform devices created by the IPMI driver was not
    being done correctly and could result in a memory leak.  So
    create a local boolean to know how to clean up those platform
    devices.

    hrtimer: Ensure POSIX compliance (relative CLOCK_REALTIME hrtimers)
    
    commit 48d0c9becc7f3c66874c100c126459a9da0fdced upstream.
    
    The POSIX specification defines that relative CLOCK_REALTIME timers are not
    affected by clock modifications. Those timers have to use CLOCK_MONOTONIC
    to ensure POSIX compliance.
    
    The introduction of the additional HRTIMER_MODE_PINNED mode broke this
    requirement for pinned timers.
    
    There is no user space visible impact because user space timers are not
    using pinned mode, but for consistency reasons this needs to be fixed.
    
    Check whether the mode has the HRTIMER_MODE_REL bit set instead of
    comparing with HRTIMER_MODE_ABS.

    vsprintf: avoid misleading "(null)" for %px
    
    commit 3a129cc2151425e5aeb69aeb25fbc994ec738137 upstream.
    
    Like %pK already does, print "00000000" instead.
    
    This confused people -- the convention is that "(null)" means you tried to
    dereference a null pointer as opposed to printing the address.
