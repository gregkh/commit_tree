    btrfs: check the right error variable in btrfs_del_dir_entries_in_log
    
    [ Upstream commit fb2fecbad50964b9f27a3b182e74e437b40753ef ]
    
    With my new locking code dbench is so much faster that I tripped over a
    transaction abort from ENOSPC.  This turned out to be because
    btrfs_del_dir_entries_in_log was checking for ret == -ENOSPC, but this
    function sets err on error, and returns err.  So instead of properly
    marking the inode as needing a full commit, we were returning -ENOSPC
    and aborting in __btrfs_unlink_inode.  Fix this by checking the proper
    variable so that we return the correct thing in the case of ENOSPC.
    
    The ENOENT needs to be checked, because btrfs_lookup_dir_item_index()
    can return -ENOENT if the dir item isn't in the tree log (which would
    happen if we hadn't fsync'ed this guy).  We actually handle that case in
    __btrfs_unlink_inode, so it's an expected error to get back.

    commit 2b74b0a04d3e9f9f08ff026e5663dce88ff94e52 upstream.
    
    Some values extracted by ncm_unwrap_ntb() could possibly lead to several
    different out of bounds reads of memory.  Specifically the values passed
    to netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align() need to be checked so that memory is not
    overflowed.
    
    Resolve this by applying bounds checking to a number of different
    indexes and lengths of the structure parsing logic.

    commit b1cd1b65afba95971fa457dfdb2c941c60d38c5b upstream.
    
    size can potentially hold an overflowed value if its assigned expression
    is left unchecked, leading to a smaller than needed allocation when
    vla_group_size() is used by callers to allocate memory.
    To fix this, add a test for saturation before declaring variables and an
    overflow check to (n) * sizeof(type).
    If the expression results in overflow, vla_group_size() will return SIZE_MAX.

    array3_size(a, b, c): 3-dimensional array
    struct_size(ptr, member, n): struct followed by n-many trailing members
    
    Each of these return SIZE_MAX on overflow instead of wrapping around.
    
    (Additionally renames a variable named "array_size" to avoid future
    collision.)

    When the primary firmware node pointer is removed from a

    is pointing to a non-existing object, clearing it properly
    when the primary node is removed from a device in
    set_primary_fwnode().

    PM: sleep: core: Fix the handling of pending runtime resume requests
    
    commit e3eb6e8fba65094328b8dca635d00de74ba75b45 upstream.
    
    It has been reported that system-wide suspend may be aborted in the
    absence of any wakeup events due to unforseen interactions of it with
    the runtume PM framework.
    
    One failing scenario is when there are multiple devices sharing an
    ACPI power resource and runtime-resume needs to be carried out for
    one of them during system-wide suspend (for example, because it needs
    to be reconfigured before the whole system goes to sleep).  In that
    case, the runtime-resume of that device involves turning the ACPI
    power resource "on" which in turn causes runtime-resume requests
    to be queued up for all of the other devices sharing it.  Those
    requests go to the runtime PM workqueue which is frozen during
    system-wide suspend, so they are not actually taken care of until
    the resume of the whole system, but the pm_runtime_barrier()
    call in __device_suspend() sees them and triggers system wakeup
    events for them which then cause the system-wide suspend to be
    aborted if wakeup source objects are in active use.
    
    Of course, the logic that leads to triggering those wakeup events is
    questionable in the first place, because clearly there are cases in
    which a pending runtime resume request for a device is not connected
    to any real wakeup events in any way (like the one above).  Moreover,
    it is racy, because the device may be resuming already by the time
    the pm_runtime_barrier() runs and so if the driver doesn't take care
    of signaling the wakeup event as appropriate, it will be lost.
    However, if the driver does take care of that, the extra
    pm_wakeup_event() call in the core is redundant.
    
    Accordingly, drop the conditional pm_wakeup_event() call fron
    __device_suspend() and make the latter call pm_runtime_barrier()
    alone.  Also modify the comment next to that call to reflect the new
    code and extend it to mention the need to avoid unwanted interactions
    between runtime PM and system-wide device suspend callbacks.

    xhci: Do warm-reset when both CAS and XDEV_RESUME are set
    
    commit 904df64a5f4d5ebd670801d869ca0a6d6a6e8df6 upstream.
    
    Sometimes re-plugging a USB device during system sleep renders the device
    useless:
    [  173.418345] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: Get port status 2-4 read: 0x14203e2, return 0x10262

    [  176.496781] usb usb2-port4: status 0000.0262 after resume, -19
    [  176.497103] usb 2-4: can't resume, status -19
    [  176.497438] usb usb2-port4: logical disconnect
    
    Because PLS equals to XDEV_RESUME, xHCI driver reports U3 to usbcore,
    despite of CAS bit is flagged.
    
    So proritize CAS over XDEV_RESUME to let usbcore handle warm-reset for
    the port.

    XEN uses irqdesc::irq_data_common::handler_data to store a per interrupt XEN data pointer which contains XEN specific information.
    
    commit c330fb1ddc0a922f044989492b7fcca77ee1db46 upstream.
    
    handler data is meant for interrupt handlers and not for storing irq chip
    specific information as some devices require handler data to store internal
    per interrupt information, e.g. pinctrl/GPIO chained interrupt handlers.
    
    This obviously creates a conflict of interests and crashes the machine
    because the XEN pointer is overwritten by the driver pointer.
    
    As the XEN data is not handler specific it should be stored in
    irqdesc::irq_data::chip_data instead.
    
    A simple sed s/irq_[sg]et_handler_data/irq_[sg]et_chip_data/ cures that.

    writeback: Fix sync livelock due to b_dirty_time processing
    
    commit f9cae926f35e8230330f28c7b743ad088611a8de upstream.
    
    When we are processing writeback for sync(2), move_expired_inodes()
    didn't set any inode expiry value (older_than_this). This can result in
    writeback never completing if there's steady stream of inodes added to
    b_dirty_time list as writeback rechecks dirty lists after each writeback
    round whether there's more work to be done. Fix the problem by using
    sync(2) start time is inode expiry value when processing b_dirty_time
    list similarly as for ordinarily dirtied inodes. This requires some
    refactoring of older_than_this handling which simplifies the code
    noticeably as a bonus.

    writeback: Avoid skipping inode writeback
    
    commit 5afced3bf28100d81fb2fe7e98918632a08feaf5 upstream.
    
    Inode's i_io_list list head is used to attach inode to several different
    lists - wb->{b_dirty, b_dirty_time, b_io, b_more_io}. When flush worker
    prepares a list of inodes to writeback e.g. for sync(2), it moves inodes
    to b_io list. Thus it is critical for sync(2) data integrity guarantees
    that inode is not requeued to any other writeback list when inode is
    queued for processing by flush worker. That's the reason why
    writeback_single_inode() does not touch i_io_list (unless the inode is
    completely clean) and why __mark_inode_dirty() does not touch i_io_list
    if I_SYNC flag is set.
    
    However there are two flaws in the current logic:
    
    1) When inode has only I_DIRTY_TIME set but it is already queued in b_io
    list due to sync(2), concurrent __mark_inode_dirty(inode, I_DIRTY_SYNC)
    can still move inode back to b_dirty list resulting in skipping
    writeback of inode time stamps during sync(2).
    
    2) When inode is on b_dirty_time list and writeback_single_inode() races
    with __mark_inode_dirty() like:
    
    writeback_single_inode()                __mark_inode_dirty(inode, I_DIRTY_PAGES)
      inode->i_state |= I_SYNC
      __writeback_single_inode()
                                              inode->i_state |= I_DIRTY_PAGES;
                                              if (inode->i_state & I_SYNC)
                                                bail
      if (!(inode->i_state & I_DIRTY_ALL))
      - not true so nothing done
    
    We end up with I_DIRTY_PAGES inode on b_dirty_time list and thus
    standard background writeback will not writeback this inode leading to
    possible dirty throttling stalls etc. (thanks to Martijn Coenen for this
    analysis).
    
    Fix these problems by tracking whether inode is queued in b_io or
    b_more_io lists in a new I_SYNC_QUEUED flag. When this flag is set, we
    know flush worker has queued inode and we should not touch i_io_list.
    On the other hand we also know that once flush worker is done with the
    inode it will requeue the inode to appropriate dirty list. When
    I_SYNC_QUEUED is not set, __mark_inode_dirty() can (and must) move inode
    to appropriate dirty list.

    commit b35250c0816c7cf7d0a8de92f5fafb6a7508a708 upstream.
    
    Currently, operations on inode->i_io_list are protected by
    wb->list_lock. In the following patches we'll need to maintain
    consistency between inode->i_state and inode->i_io_list so change the

    serial: 8250: change lock order in serial8250_do_startup()
    
    commit 205d300aea75623e1ae4aa43e0d265ab9cf195fd upstream.
    
    We have a number of "uart.port->desc.lock vs desc.lock->uart.port"
    lockdep reports coming from 8250 driver; this causes a bit of trouble
    to people, so let's fix it.
    
    The problem is reverse lock order in two different call paths:
    
    chain #1:
    
     serial8250_do_startup()
      spin_lock_irqsave(&port->lock);
       disable_irq_nosync(port->irq);
        raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&desc->lock)
    
    chain #2:
    
      __report_bad_irq()
       raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&desc->lock)
        for_each_action_of_desc()
         printk()
          spin_lock_irqsave(&port->lock);
    
    Fix this by changing the order of locks in serial8250_do_startup():
     do disable_irq_nosync() first, which grabs desc->lock, and grab
     uart->port after that, so that chain #1 and chain #2 have same lock
     order.
    
    Full lockdep splat:

    serial: pl011: Don't leak amba_ports entry on driver register error
    
    commit 89efbe70b27dd325d8a8c177743a26b885f7faec upstream.
    
    pl011_probe() calls pl011_setup_port() to reserve an amba_ports[] entry,
    then calls pl011_register_port() to register the uart driver with the
    tty layer.
    
    If registration of the uart driver fails, the amba_ports[] entry is not
    released.  If this happens 14 times (value of UART_NR macro), then all
    amba_ports[] entries will have been leaked and driver probing is no
    longer possible.  (To be fair, that can only happen if the DeviceTree
    doesn't contain alias IDs since they cause the same entry to be used for
    a given port.)   Fix it.

    If probing of a pl011 gets deferred until after free_initmem(), an oops
    ensues because pl011_console_match() is called which has been freed.
    
    Fix by removing the __init attribute from the function and those it
    calls.
    
    Commit 10879ae5f12e ("serial: pl011: add console matching function")
    introduced pl011_console_match() not just for early consoles but
    regular preferred consoles, such as those added by acpi_parse_spcr().
    Regular consoles may be registered after free_initmem() for various
    reasons, one being deferred probing, another being dynamic enablement
    of serial ports using a DeviceTree overlay.
    
    Thus, pl011_console_match() must not be declared __init and the
    functions it calls mustn't either.

    serial: samsung: Removes the IRQ not found warning
    
    commit 8c6c378b0cbe0c9f1390986b5f8ffb5f6ff7593b upstream.
    
    In few older Samsung SoCs like s3c2410, s3c2412
    and s3c2440, UART IP is having 2 interrupt lines.
    However, in other SoCs like s3c6400, s5pv210,
    exynos5433, and exynos4210 UART is having only 1
    interrupt line. Due to this, "platform_get_irq(platdev, 1)"
    call in the driver gives the following false-positive error:
    "IRQ index 1 not found" on newer SoC's.
    
    This patch adds the condition to check for Tx interrupt
    only for the those SoC's which have 2 interrupt lines.

    vt: defer kfree() of vc_screenbuf in vc_do_resize()
    
    commit f8d1653daec02315e06d30246cff4af72e76e54e upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting UAF bug in set_origin() from vc_do_resize() [1], for
    vc_do_resize() calls kfree(vc->vc_screenbuf) before calling set_origin().
    
    Unfortunately, in set_origin(), vc->vc_sw->con_set_origin() might access
    vc->vc_pos when scroll is involved in order to manipulate cursor, but
    vc->vc_pos refers already released vc->vc_screenbuf until vc->vc_pos gets
    updated based on the result of vc->vc_sw->con_set_origin().
    
    Preserving old buffer and tolerating outdated vc members until set_origin()
    completes would be easier than preventing vc->vc_sw->con_set_origin() from
    accessing outdated vc members.

    btrfs: fix space cache memory leak after transaction abort
    
    commit bbc37d6e475eee8ffa2156ec813efc6bbb43c06d upstream.
    
    If a transaction aborts it can cause a memory leak of the pages array of
    a block group's io_ctl structure. The following steps explain how that can
    happen:
    
    1) Transaction N is committing, currently in state TRANS_STATE_UNBLOCKED
       and it's about to start writing out dirty extent buffers;
    
    2) Transaction N + 1 already started and another task, task A, just called
       btrfs_commit_transaction() on it;
    
    3) Block group B was dirtied (extents allocated from it) by transaction
       N + 1, so when task A calls btrfs_start_dirty_block_groups(), at the
       very beginning of the transaction commit, it starts writeback for the
       block group's space cache by calling btrfs_write_out_cache(), which
       allocates the pages array for the block group's io_ctl with a call to
       io_ctl_init(). Block group A is added to the io_list of transaction
       N + 1 by btrfs_start_dirty_block_groups();
    
    4) While transaction N's commit is writing out the extent buffers, it gets
       an IO error and aborts transaction N, also setting the file system to
       RO mode;
    
    5) Task A has already returned from btrfs_start_dirty_block_groups(), is at
       btrfs_commit_transaction() and has set transaction N + 1 state to
       TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START. Immediately after that it checks that the
       filesystem was turned to RO mode, due to transaction N's abort, and
       jumps to the "cleanup_transaction" label. After that we end up at
       btrfs_cleanup_one_transaction() which calls btrfs_cleanup_dirty_bgs().
       That helper finds block group B in the transaction's io_list but it
       never releases the pages array of the block group's io_ctl, resulting in
       a memory leak.
    
    In fact at the point when we are at btrfs_cleanup_dirty_bgs(), the pages
    array points to pages that were already released by us at
    __btrfs_write_out_cache() through the call to io_ctl_drop_pages(). We end
    up freeing the pages array only after waiting for the ordered extent to
    complete through btrfs_wait_cache_io(), which calls io_ctl_free() to do
    that. But in the transaction abort case we don't wait for the space cache's
    ordered extent to complete through a call to btrfs_wait_cache_io(), so
    that's why we end up with a memory leak - we wait for the ordered extent
    to complete indirectly by shutting down the work queues and waiting for
    any jobs in them to complete before returning from close_ctree().
    
    We can solve the leak simply by freeing the pages array right after
    releasing the pages (with the call to io_ctl_drop_pages()) at
    __btrfs_write_out_cache(), since we will never use it anymore after that
    and the pages array points to already released pages at that point, which
    is currently not a problem since no one will use it after that, but not a
    good practice anyway since it can easily lead to use-after-free issues.
    
    So fix this by freeing the pages array right after releasing the pages at
    __btrfs_write_out_cache().
    
    This issue can often be reproduced with test case generic/475 from fstests
    and kmemleak can detect it and reports it with the following trace:

    HID: i2c-hid: Always sleep 60ms after I2C_HID_PWR_ON commands
    
    commit eef4016243e94c438f177ca8226876eb873b9c75 upstream.
    
    Before this commit i2c_hid_parse() consists of the following steps:
    
    1. Send power on cmd
    2. usleep_range(1000, 5000)
    3. Send reset cmd
    4. Wait for reset to complete (device interrupt, or msleep(100))
    5. Send power on cmd
    6. Try to read HID descriptor
    
    Notice how there is an usleep_range(1000, 5000) after the first power-on
    command, but not after the second power-on command.
    
    Testing has shown that at least on the BMAX Y13 laptop's i2c-hid touchpad,
    not having a delay after the second power-on command causes the HID
    descriptor to read as all zeros.
    
    In case we hit this on other devices too, the descriptor being all zeros
    can be recognized by the following message being logged many, many times:
    
    hid-generic 0018:0911:5288.0002: unknown main item tag 0x0
    
    At the same time as the BMAX Y13's touchpad issue was debugged,
    Kai-Heng was working on debugging some issues with Goodix i2c-hid
    touchpads. It turns out that these need a delay after a PWR_ON command
    too, otherwise they stop working after a suspend/resume cycle.
    According to Goodix a delay of minimal 60ms is needed.
    
    Having multiple cases where we need a delay after sending the power-on
    command, seems to indicate that we should always sleep after the power-on
    command.
    
    This commit fixes the mentioned issues by moving the existing 1ms sleep to
    the i2c_hid_set_power() function and changing it to a 60ms sleep.

    powerpc/perf: Fix soft lockups due to missed interrupt accounting
    
    [ Upstream commit 17899eaf88d689529b866371344c8f269ba79b5f ]
    
    Performance monitor interrupt handler checks if any counter has
    overflown and calls record_and_restart() in core-book3s which invokes
    perf_event_overflow() to record the sample information. Apart from
    creating sample, perf_event_overflow() also does the interrupt and
    period checks via perf_event_account_interrupt().
    
    Currently we record information only if the SIAR (Sampled Instruction
    Address Register) valid bit is set (using siar_valid() check) and
    hence the interrupt check.
    
    But it is possible that we do sampling for some events that are not
    generating valid SIAR, and hence there is no chance to disable the
    event if interrupts are more than max_samples_per_tick. This leads to
    soft lockup.
    
    Fix this by adding perf_event_account_interrupt() in the invalid SIAR
    code path for a sampling event. ie if SIAR is invalid, just do
    interrupt check and don't record the sample information.

    Every iteration of for_each_available_child_of_node() decrements
    reference count of the previous node, however when control

    resulting in a memory leak.
    
    Fix a potential memory leak in gianfar.c by inserting of_node_put()

    scsi: ufs: Fix possible infinite loop in ufshcd_hold
    
    [ Upstream commit 93b6c5db06028a3b55122bbb74d0715dd8ca4ae0 ]
    
    In ufshcd_suspend(), after clk-gating is suspended and link is set
    as Hibern8 state, ufshcd_hold() is still possibly invoked before
    ufshcd_suspend() returns. For example, MediaTek's suspend vops may
    issue UIC commands which would call ufshcd_hold() during the command
    issuing flow.
    
    Now if UFSHCD_CAP_HIBERN8_WITH_CLK_GATING capability is enabled,
    then ufshcd_hold() may enter infinite loops because there is no

    s390/cio: add cond_resched() in the slow_eval_known_fn() loop
    
    [ Upstream commit 0b8eb2ee9da1e8c9b8082f404f3948aa82a057b2 ]
    
    The scanning through subchannels during the time of an event could
    take significant amount of time in case of platforms with lots of
    known subchannels. This might result in higher scheduling latencies
    for other tasks especially on systems with a single CPU. Add
    cond_resched() call, as the loop in slow_eval_known_fn() can be
    executed for a longer duration.

    fs: prevent BUG_ON in submit_bh_wbc()
    
    [ Upstream commit 377254b2cd2252c7c3151b113cbdf93a7736c2e9 ]
    
    If a device is hot-removed --- for example, when a physical device is
    unplugged from pcie slot or a nbd device's network is shutdown ---
    this can result in a BUG_ON() crash in submit_bh_wbc().  This is
    because the when the block device dies, the buffer heads will have
    their Buffer_Mapped flag get cleared, leading to the crash in
    submit_bh_wbc.
    
    We had attempted to work around this problem in commit a17712c8
    ("ext4: check superblock mapped prior to committing").  Unfortunately,
    it's still possible to hit the BUG_ON(!buffer_mapped(bh)) if the
    device dies between when the work-around check in ext4_commit_super()
    and when submit_bh_wbh() is finally called:
    
    Code path:
    ext4_commit_super
        judge if 'buffer_mapped(sbh)' is false, return <== commit a17712c8
              lock_buffer(sbh)
              ...
              unlock_buffer(sbh)
                   __sync_dirty_buffer(sbh,...
                        lock_buffer(sbh)
                            judge if 'buffer_mapped(sbh))' is false, return <== added by this patch

    jbd2: abort journal if free a async write error metadata buffer
    
    [ Upstream commit c044f3d8360d2ecf831ba2cc9f08cf9fb2c699fb ]
    
    If we free a metadata buffer which has been failed to async write out
    in the background, the jbd2 checkpoint procedure will not detect this
    failure in jbd2_log_do_checkpoint(), so it may lead to filesystem
    inconsistency after cleanup journal tail. This patch abort the journal
    if free a buffer has write_io_error flag to prevent potential further
    inconsistency.

    jbd2: make sure jh have b_transaction set in refile/unfile_buffer
    
    [ Upstream commit 24dc9864914eb5813173cfa53313fcd02e4aea7d ]
    
    Callers of __jbd2_journal_unfile_buffer() and
    __jbd2_journal_refile_buffer() assume that the b_transaction is set. In
    fact if it's not, we can end up with journal_head refcounting errors
    leading to crash much later that might be very hard to track down. Add
    asserts to make sure that is the case.
    
    We also make sure that b_next_transaction is NULL in
    __jbd2_journal_unfile_buffer() since the callers expect that as well and
    we should not get into that stage in this state anyway, leading to
    problems later on if we do.
    
    Tested with fstests.

    Currently, a NACK in slave mode is set/cleared when SCL is held low by
    the IP core right before the bit is about to be pushed out. This is too

    for the current one. Now, let's clear the NACK right after we detected

    Revert "ath10k: fix DMA related firmware crashes on multiple devices"
    
    [ Upstream commit a1769bb68a850508a492e3674ab1e5e479b11254 ]
    
    This reverts commit 76d164f582150fd0259ec0fcbc485470bcd8033e.
    PCIe hung issue was observed on multiple platforms. The issue was reproduced
    when DUT was configured as AP and associated with 50+ STAs.
    
    For QCA9984/QCA9888, the DMA_BURST_SIZE register controls the AXI burst size
    of the RD/WR access to the HOST MEM.
    0 - No split , RAW read/write transfer size from MAC is put out on bus
        as burst length
    1 - Split at 256 byte boundary
    2,3 - Reserved
    
    With PCIe protocol analyzer, we can see DMA Read crossing 4KB boundary when
    issue happened. It broke PCIe spec and caused PCIe stuck. So revert
    the default value from 0 to 1.
    
    Tested:  IPQ8064 + QCA9984 with firmware 10.4-3.10-00047
             QCS404 + QCA9984 with firmware 10.4-3.9.0.2--00044

    [ Upstream commit b38b298aa4397e2dc74a89b4dd3eac9e59b64c96 ]
    
    __hyp_call_panic_nvhe contains inline assembly which did not declare
    its dependency on the __hyp_panic_string symbol.
    
    The static-declared string has previously been kept alive because of a use in
    __hyp_call_panic_vhe. Fix this in preparation for separating the source files
    between VHE and nVHE when the two users land in two different compilation
    units. The static variable otherwise gets dropped when compiling the nVHE
    source file, causing an undefined symbol linker error later.

    EDAC/ie31200: Fallback if host bridge device is already initialized
    
    [ Upstream commit 709ed1bcef12398ac1a35c149f3e582db04456c2 ]
    
    The Intel uncore driver may claim some of the pci ids from ie31200 which
    means that the ie31200 edac driver will not initialize them as part of
    pci_register_driver().
    
    Let's add a fallback for this case to 'pci_get_device()' to get a
    reference on the device such that it can still be configured. This is
    similar in approach to other edac drivers.

    In fcoe_sysfs_fcf_del(), we first deleted the fcf from the list and then
    freed it if ctlr_dev was not NULL. This was causing a memory leak.
    
    Free the fcf even if ctlr_dev is NULL.

    ceph: fix potential mdsc use-after-free crash
    
    [ Upstream commit fa9967734227b44acb1b6918033f9122dc7825b9 ]
    
    Make sure the delayed work stopped before releasing the resources.
    
    cancel_delayed_work_sync() will only guarantee that the work finishes
    executing if the work is already in the ->worklist.  That means after
    the cancel_delayed_work_sync() returns, it will leave the work requeued
    if it was rearmed at the end. That can lead to a use after free once the
    work struct is freed.
    
    Fix it by flushing the delayed work instead of trying to cancel it, and
    ensure that the work doesn't rearm if the mdsc is stopping.

    selftests/powerpc: Purge extra count_pmc() calls of ebb selftests
    
    [ Upstream commit 3337bf41e0dd70b4064cdf60acdfcdc2d050066c ]
    
    An extra count on ebb_state.stats.pmc_count[PMC_INDEX(pmc)] is being per-
    formed when count_pmc() is used to reset PMCs on a few selftests. This
    extra pmc_count can occasionally invalidate results, such as the ones from
    cycles_test shown hereafter. The ebb_check_count() failed with an above
    the upper limit error due to the extra value on ebb_state.stats.pmc_count.
    
    Furthermore, this extra count is also indicated by extra PMC1 trace_log on
    the output of the cycle test (as well as on pmc56_overflow_test):

    scsi: lpfc: Fix shost refcount mismatch when deleting vport
    
    [ Upstream commit 03dbfe0668e6692917ac278883e0586cd7f7d753 ]
    
    When vports are deleted, it is observed that there is memory/kthread
    leakage as the vport isn't fully being released.
    
    There is a shost reference taken in scsi_add_host_dma that is not released
    during scsi_remove_host. It was noticed that other drivers resolve this by
    doing a scsi_host_put after calling scsi_remove_host.
    
    The vport_delete routine is taking two references one that corresponds to
    an access to the scsi_host in the vport_delete routine and another that is
    released after the adapter mailbox command completes that destroys the VPI
    that corresponds to the vport.
    
    Remove one of the references taken such that the second reference that is
    put will complete the missing scsi_add_host_dma reference and the shost
    will be terminated.

    [ Upstream commit d3e3d2be688b4b5864538de61e750721a311e4fc ]
    
    Unlike the other instances which represent a complete loss of
    consistency within the rcache mechanism itself, or a fundamental
    and obvious misconfiguration by an IOMMU driver, the BUG_ON() in
    iova_magazine_free_pfns() can be provoked at more or less any time
    in a "spooky action-at-a-distance" manner by any old device driver
    passing nonsense to dma_unmap_*() which then propagates through to
    queue_iova().
    
    Not only is this well outside the IOVA layer's control, it's also
    nowhere near fatal enough to justify panicking anyway - all that
    really achieves is to make debugging the offending driver more
    difficult. Let's simply WARN and otherwise ignore bogus PFNs.

    scsi: target: tcmu: Fix crash on ARM during cmd completion
    
    [ Upstream commit 5a0c256d96f020e4771f6fd5524b80f89a2d3132 ]
    
    If tcmu_handle_completions() has to process a padding shorter than
    sizeof(struct tcmu_cmd_entry), the current call to
    tcmu_flush_dcache_range() with sizeof(struct tcmu_cmd_entry) as length
    param is wrong and causes crashes on e.g. ARM, because
    tcmu_flush_dcache_range() in this case calls
    flush_dcache_page(vmalloc_to_page(start)); with start being an invalid
    address above the end of the vmalloc'ed area.
    
    The fix is to use the minimum of remaining ring space and sizeof(struct
    tcmu_cmd_entry) as the length param.
    
    The patch was tested on kernel 4.19.118.

    media: pci: ttpci: av7110: fix possible buffer overflow caused by bad DMA value in debiirq()
    
    [ Upstream commit 6499a0db9b0f1e903d52f8244eacc1d4be00eea2 ]
    
    The value av7110->debi_virt is stored in DMA memory, and it is assigned
    to data, and thus data[0] can be modified at any time by malicious
    hardware. In this case, "if (data[0] < 2)" can be passed, but then
    data[0] can be changed into a large number, which may cause buffer
    overflow when the code "av7110->ci_slot[data[0]]" is used.
    
    To fix this possible bug, data[0] is assigned to a local variable, which
    replaces the use of data[0].

    [ Upstream commit e2ee9edc282961783d519c760bbaa20fed4dec38 ]
    
    The original qcom kernel changed the PDM GPIOs to be pull-down
    during sleep at some point. Reportedly this was done because
    there was some "leakage at PDM outputs during sleep":
    
      https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/la/kernel/msm-3.10/commit/?id=0f87e08c1cd3e6484a6f7fb3e74e37340bdcdee0
    
    I cannot say how effective this is, but everything seems to work
    fine with this change so let's apply the same to mainline just
    to be sure.

    gre6: Fix reception with IP6_TNL_F_RCV_DSCP_COPY
    
    [ Upstream commit 272502fcb7cda01ab07fc2fcff82d1d2f73d43cc ]
    
    When receiving an IPv4 packet inside an IPv6 GRE packet, and the
    IP6_TNL_F_RCV_DSCP_COPY flag is set on the tunnel, the IPv4 header would
    get corrupted. This is due to the common ip6_tnl_rcv() function assuming
    that the inner header is always IPv6. This patch checks the tunnel
    protocol for IPv4 inner packets, but still defaults to IPv6.

    tipc: fix uninit skb->data in tipc_nl_compat_dumpit()
    
    [ Upstream commit 47733f9daf4fe4f7e0eb9e273f21ad3a19130487 ]
    
    __tipc_nl_compat_dumpit() has two callers, and it expects them to
    pass a valid nlmsghdr via arg->data. This header is artificial and
    crafted just for __tipc_nl_compat_dumpit().
    
    tipc_nl_compat_publ_dump() does so by putting a genlmsghdr as well
    as some nested attribute, TIPC_NLA_SOCK. But the other caller
    tipc_nl_compat_dumpit() does not, this leaves arg->data uninitialized
    on this call path.
    
    Fix this by just adding a similar nlmsghdr without any payload in
    tipc_nl_compat_dumpit().
    
    This bug exists since day 1, but the recent commit 6ea67769ff33
    ("net: tipc: prepare attrs in __tipc_nl_compat_dumpit()") makes it
    easier to appear.

    bonding: show saner speed for broadcast mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 4ca0d9ac3fd8f9f90b72a15d8da2aca3ffb58418 ]
    
    Broadcast mode bonds transmit a copy of all traffic simultaneously out of
    all interfaces, so the "speed" of the bond isn't really the aggregate of
    all interfaces, but rather, the speed of the slowest active interface.
    
    Also, the type of the speed field is u32, not unsigned long, so adjust
    that accordingly, as required to make min() function here without
    complaining about mismatching types.

    [ Upstream commit 832707021666411d04795c564a4adea5d6b94f17 ]
    
    When we tear down a network namespace, we unregister all
    the netdevices within it. So we may queue a slave device
    and a bonding device together in the same unregister queue.
    
    If the only slave device is non-ethernet, it would
    automatically unregister the bonding device as well. Thus,
    we may end up unregistering the bonding device twice.
    
    Workaround this special case by checking reg_state.
