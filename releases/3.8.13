    x86/mm: account for PGDIR_SIZE alignment
    
    Patch for -stable.  Function find_early_table_space removed upstream.
    
    Fixes panic in alloc_low_page due to pgt_buf overflow during
    init_memory_mapping.
    
    find_early_table_space sizes pgt_buf based upon the size of the
    memory being mapped, but it does not take into account the alignment
    of the memory.  When the region being mapped spans a 512GB (PGDIR_SIZE)
    alignment, a panic from alloc_low_pages occurs.
    
    kernel_physical_mapping_init takes into account PGDIR_SIZE alignment.
    This causes an extra call to alloc_low_page to be made.  This extra call
    isn't accounted for by find_early_table_space and causes a kernel panic.
    
    Change is to take into account PGDIR_SIZE alignment in find_early_table_space.

    NFSv4.x: Fix handling of partially delegated locks
    
    commit c5a2a15f8146fdfe45078df7873a6dc1006b3869 upstream.
    
    If a NFS client receives a delegation for a file after it has taken
    a lock on that file, we can currently end up in a situation where
    we mistakenly skip unlocking that file.
    
    The following patch swaps an erroneous check in nfs4_proc_unlck for
    whether or not the file has a delegation to one which checks whether
    or not we hold a lock stateid for that file.

    EDAC: Don't give write permission to read-only files
    
    commit c8c64d165ccfd2274058ac84e0c680f9b48c4ec1 upstream.
    
    I get the following warning on boot:
    
    ------------[ cut here ]------------
    WARNING: at drivers/base/core.c:575 device_create_file+0x9a/0xa0()
    Hardware name:  -[8737R2A]-

    ...
    </snip>
    
    Drilling down, this is related to dynamic channel ce_count attribute
    files sporting a S_IWUSR mode without a ->store() function. Looking
    around, it appears that they aren't supposed to have a ->store()
    function. So remove the bogus write permission to get rid of the
    warning.

    merged extent.  We need to use the actual extent from the on disk file extent
    item, which we have to lookup to make sure it's ok to nocow anyway so just pass

    Btrfs: compare relevant parts of delayed tree refs
    
    commit 41b0fc42800569f63e029549b75c4c9cb63f2dfd upstream.
    
    A user reported a panic while running a balance.  What was happening was he was
    relocating a block, which added the reference to the relocation tree.  Then
    relocation would walk through the relocation tree and drop that reference and
    free that block, and then it would walk down a snapshot which referenced the
    same block and add another ref to the block.  The problem is this was all
    happening in the same transaction, so the parent block was free'ed up when we
    drop our reference which was immediately available for allocation, and then it
    was used _again_ to add a reference for the same block from a different
    snapshot.  This resulted in something like this in the delayed ref tree
    
    add ref to 90234880, parent=2067398656, ref_root 1766, level 1
    del ref to 90234880, parent=2067398656, ref_root 18446744073709551608, level 1
    add ref to 90234880, parent=2067398656, ref_root 1767, level 1
    
    as you can see the ref_root's don't match, because when we inc the ref we use
    the header owner, which is the original tree the block belonged to, instead of
    the data reloc tree.  Then when we remove the extent we use the reloc tree
    objectid.  But none of this matters, since it is a shared reference which means
    only the parent matters.  When the delayed ref stuff runs it adds all the
    increments first, and then does all the drops, to make sure that we don't delete
    the ref if we net a positive ref count.  But tree blocks aren't allowed to have
    multiple refs from the same block, so this panics when it tries to add the
    second ref.  We need the add and the drop to cancel each other out in memory so
    we only do the final add.
    
    So to fix this we need to adjust how the delayed refs are added to the tree.
    Only the ref_root matters when it is a normal backref, and only the parent
    matters when it is a shared backref.  So make our decision based on what ref
    type we have.  This allows us to keep the ref_root in memory in case anybody
    wants to use it for something else, and it allows the delayed refs to be merged
    properly so we don't end up with this panic.
    
    With this patch the users image no longer panics on mount, and it has a clean
    fsck after a normal mount/umount cycle.  Thanks,

    tracing: Fix ftrace_dump()
    
    commit 7fe70b579c9e3daba71635e31b6189394e7b79d3 upstream.
    
    ftrace_dump() had a lot of issues. What ftrace_dump() does, is when
    ftrace_dump_on_oops is set (via a kernel parameter or sysctl), it
    will dump out the ftrace buffers to the console when either a oops,
    panic, or a sysrq-z occurs.
    
    This was written a long time ago when ftrace was fragile to recursion.
    But it wasn't written well even for that.
    
    There's a possible deadlock that can occur if a ftrace_dump() is happening
    and an NMI triggers another dump. This is because it grabs a lock
    before checking if the dump ran.
    
    It also totally disables ftrace, and tracing for no good reasons.
    
    As the ring_buffer now checks if it is read via a oops or NMI, where
    there's a chance that the buffer gets corrupted, it will disable
    itself. No need to have ftrace_dump() do the same.
    
    ftrace_dump() is now cleaned up where it uses an atomic counter to
    make sure only one dump happens at a time. A simple atomic_inc_return()
    is enough that is needed for both other CPUs and NMIs. No need for
    a spinlock, as if one CPU is running the dump, no other CPU needs
    to do it too.
    
    The tracing_on variable is turned off and not turned on. The original
    code did this, but it wasn't pretty. By just disabling this variable
    we get the result of not seeing traces that happen between crashes.
    
    For sysrq-z, it doesn't get turned on, but the user can always write
    a '1' to the tracing_on file. If they are using sysrq-z, then they should
    know about tracing_on.
    
    The new code is much easier to read and less error prone. No more
    deadlock possibility when an NMI triggers here.

    drm/i915: Fixup Oops in the pipe config computation
    
    commit b6c5164d7bf624f3e1b750787ddb983150c5117c upstream.
    
    Yet again our current confusion between doing the modeset globally,
    but only having the new parameters for one crtc at a time.
    
    So that intel_set_mode essentially already does a global modeset:
    intel_modeset_affected_pipes compares the current state with where we
    want to go to (which is carefully set up by intel_crtc_set_config) and
    then goes through the modeset sequence for any crtc which needs
    updating.
    
    Now the issue is that the actual interface with the remaining code
    still only works on one crtc, and so we only pass in one fb and one
    mode. In intel_set_mode we also only compute one intel_crtc_config
    (which should be the one for the crtc we're doing a modeset on).
    
    The reason for that mismatch is twofold:
    - We want to eventually do all modeset as global state changes, so
    it's just infrastructure prep.
    - But even the old semantics can change more than one crtc when you
    e.g. move a connector from crtc A to crtc B, then both crtc A and B
    need to be updated. Usually that means one pipe is disabled and the
    other enabled. This is also the reason why the hack doesn't touch the
    disable_pipes mask.
    
    Now hilarity ensued in our kms config restore paths when we actually
    try to do a modeset on all crtcs: If the first crtc should be off and
    the second should be on, then the call on the first crtc will notice
    that the 2nd one should be switched on and so tries to compute the
    pipe_config. But due to a lack of passed-in fb (crtc 1 should be off
    after all) it only results in tears.
    
    This case is ridiculously easy to hit on gen2/3 where the lvds output
    is restricted to pipe B. Note that before the pipe_config bpp rework
    gen2/3 didn't care really about the fb->depth, so this is a regression
    brought to light with

    But apparently Ajax also managed to blow up pch platforms, probably
    with some randomized configs, and pch platforms trip up over the lack
    of an fb even in the old code. So this actually goes back to the first
    introduction of the new modeset restore code in

    drm/i915: ensure single initialization and cleanup of backlight device
    
    commit dc652f90e088798bfa31f496ba994ddadd5d5680 upstream.
    
    Backlight cleanup in the eDP connector destroy callback caused the
    backlight device to be removed on some systems that first initialized LVDS
    and then attempted to initialize eDP. Prevent multiple backlight
    initializations, and ensure backlight cleanup is only done once by moving
    it to modeset cleanup.
    
    A small wrinkle is the introduced asymmetry in backlight
    setup/cleanup. This could be solved by adding refcounting, but it seems
    overkill considering that there should only ever be one backlight device.

    drm/i915: Use MLC (l3$) for context objects
    
    commit 4615d4c9e27eda42c3e965f208a4b4065841498c upstream.
    
    Enabling context support increases SwapBuffers latency by about 20%
    (measured on an i7-3720qm). We can offset that loss slightly by enabling
    faster caching for the contexts. As they are not backed by any
    particular cache (such as the sampler or render caches) our only option
    is to select the generic mid-level cache. This reduces the latency of
    the swap by about 5%.
    
    Oddly this effect can be observed running smokin-guns on IVB at
    1280x1024:
    Using BLT copies for swaps: 151.67 fps
    Using Render copies for swaps (unpatched):  141.70 fps
    With contexts disabled: 150.23 fps
    With contexts in L3$: 150.77 fps

    drm/i915: Fix SDVO connector and encoder get_hw_state functions
    
    commit 7a7d1fb79fb581553f4830498045de774a9659f8 upstream.
    
    The connector associated with the encoder is considered active when the
    output associtated with this connector is active on the encoder. The
    encoder itself is considered active when either there is an active
    output on  it or the  respective SDVO channel is active.
    Having active outputs when the SDVO channel is inactive seems to be
    inconsistent: such states can be found when intel_modeset_setup_hw_state()
    collects the hardware state set by the BIOS.
    This inconsistency will be fixed in intel_sanitize_crtc()
    (when intel_crtc_update_dpms() is called), this however only happens
    when the encoder is associated with a crtc.
    
    This patch also reverts:

    drm/i915: Fix detection of base of stolen memory
    
    commit e12a2d53ae45a69aea499b64f75e7222cca0f12f upstream.
    
    The routine to query the base of stolen memory was using the wrong
    registers and the wrong encodings on virtually every platform.
    
    It was not until the G33 refresh, that a PCI config register was
    introduced that explicitly said where the stolen memory was. Prior to
    865G there was not even a register that said where the end of usable
    low memory was and where the stolen memory began (or ended depending
    upon chipset). Before then, one has to look at the BIOS memory maps to
    find the Top of Memory. Alas that is not exported by arch/x86 and so we
    have to resort to disabling stolen memory on gen2 for the time being.
    
    Then SandyBridge enlarged the PCI register to a full 32-bits and change
    the encoding of the address, so even though we happened to be querying
    the right register, we read the wrong bits and ended up using address 0
    for our stolen data, i.e. notably FBC.

    drm/ast: deal with bo reserve fail in dirty update path
    
    commit 306373b645d80625335b8e684fa09b14ba460cec upstream.
    
    Port over the mgag200 fix to ast as it suffers the same issue.
    
        On F19 testing, it was noticed we get a lot of errors in dmesg
        about being unable to reserve the buffer when plymouth starts,
        this is due to the buffer being in the process of migrating,
        so it makes sense we can't reserve it.
    
        In order to deal with it, this adds delayed updates for the dirty
        updates, when the bo is unreservable, in the normal console case
        this shouldn't ever happen, its just when plymouth or X is
        pushing the console bo to system memory.

    drm/prime: keep a reference from the handle to exported dma-buf (v6)
    
    commit 219b47339ced80ca580bb6ce7d1636166984afa7 upstream.
    
    Currently we have a problem with this:
    1. i915: create gem object
    2. i915: export gem object to prime
    3. radeon: import gem object
    4. close prime fd
    5. radeon: unref object
    6. i915: unref object
    
    i915 has an imported object reference in its file priv, that isn't
    cleaned up properly until fd close. The reference gets added at step 2,
    but at step 6 we don't have enough info to clean it up.
    
    The solution is to take a reference on the dma-buf when we export it,
    and drop the reference when the gem handle goes away.
    
    So when we export a dma_buf from a gem object, we keep track of it
    with the handle, we take a reference to the dma_buf. When we close
    the handle (i.e. userspace is finished with the buffer), we drop
    the reference to the dma_buf, and it gets collected.
    
    This patch isn't meant to fix any other problem or bikesheds, and it doesn't
    fix any races with other scenarios.
    
    v1.1: move export symbol line back up.
    
    v2: okay I had to do a bit more, as the first patch showed a leak
    on one of my tests, that I found using the dma-buf debugfs support,
    the problem case is exporting a buffer twice with the same handle,
    we'd add another export handle for it unnecessarily, however
    we now fail if we try to export the same object with a different gem handle,
    however I'm not sure if that is a case I want to support, and I've
    gotten the code to WARN_ON if we hit something like that.
    
    v2.1: rebase this patch, write better commit msg.
    v3: cleanup error handling, track import vs export in linked list,
    these two patches were separate previously, but seem to work better
    like this.
    v4: danvet is correct, this code is no longer useful, since the buffer
    better exist, so remove it.
    v5: always take a reference to the dma buf object, import or export.
    (Imre Deak contributed this originally)
    v6: square the circle, remove import vs export tracking now
    that there is no difference

    drm/gma500: fix backlight hotkeys behaviour on netbooks
    
    commit e127dc28cc3057575da0216cde85687153ca180f upstream.
    
    Backlight hotkeys weren't working before on certain cedartrail laptops.
    
    The source of this problem is that the hotkeys' ASLE opregion interrupts
    were simply ignored. Driver seemed to expect the interrupt to be
    associated with a pipe, but it wasn't.
    
    Accepting the ASLE interrupt without an associated pipe event flag fixes
    the issue, the backlight code is called when needed, making the
    brightness keys work properly.
    
    [patrik: This patch affects irq handling on any netbook with opregion support]

    drm/mgag200: deal with bo reserve fail in dirty update path
    
    commit 641719599528d806e00de8ae8c8453361266a312 upstream.
    
    On F19 testing, it was noticed we get a lot of errors in dmesg
    about being unable to reserve the buffer when plymouth starts,
    this is due to the buffer being in the process of migrating,
    so it makes sense we can't reserve it.
    
    In order to deal with it, this adds delayed updates for the dirty
    updates, when the bo is unreservable, in the normal console case
    this shouldn't ever happen, its just when plymouth or X is
    pushing the console bo to system memory.

    block: fix max discard sectors limit
    
    commit 871dd9286e25330c8a581e5dacfa8b1dfe1dd641 upstream.
    
    linux-v3.8-rc1 and later support for plug for blkdev_issue_discard with
    commit 0cfbcafcae8b7364b5fa96c2b26ccde7a3a296a9
    (block: add plug for blkdev_issue_discard )
    
    For example,
    1) DISCARD rq-1 with size size 4GB
    2) DISCARD rq-2 with size size 1GB
    
    If these 2 discard requests get merged, final request size will be 5GB.
    
    In this case, request's __data_len field may overflow as it can store
    max 4GB(unsigned int).
    
    This issue was observed while doing mkfs.f2fs on 5GB SD card:
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/4/1/292
    
    Info: sector size = 512
    Info: total sectors = 11370496 (in 512bytes)
    Info: zone aligned segment0 blkaddr: 512
    [  257.789764] blk_update_request: bio idx 0 >= vcnt 0
    
    mkfs process gets stuck in D state and I see the following in the dmesg:

    arm64: Ignore the 'write' ESR flag on cache maintenance faults
    
    commit 0e7f7bcc3fc87489cda5aa6aff8ce40eed912279 upstream.
    
    ESR.WnR bit is always set on data cache maintenance faults even though
    the page is not required to have write permission. If a translation
    fault (page not yet mapped) happens for read-only user address range,
    Linux incorrectly assumes a permission fault. This patch adds the check
    of the ESR.CM bit during the page fault handling to ignore the 'write'
    flag.

    RDMA/cxgb4: Fix SQ allocation when on-chip SQ is disabled
    
    commit 5b0c275926b8149c555da874bb4ec258ea3292aa upstream.
    
    Commit c079c28714e4 ("RDMA/cxgb4: Fix error handling in create_qp()")
    broke SQ allocation.  Instead of falling back to host allocation when
    on-chip allocation fails, it tries to allocate both.  And when it
    does, and we try to free the address from the genpool using the host
    address, we hit a BUG and the system crashes as below.
    
    We create a new function that has the previous behavior and properly
    propagate the error, as intended.

    netfilter: xt_rpfilter: skip locally generated broadcast/multicast, too
    
    commit f83a7ea2075ca896f2dbf07672bac9cf3682ff74 upstream.
    
    Alex Efros reported rpfilter module doesn't match following packets:
    IN=br.qemu SRC=192.168.2.1 DST=192.168.2.255 [ .. ]
    (netfilter bugzilla #814).
    
    Problem is that network stack arranges for the locally generated broadcasts
    to appear on the interface they were sent out, so the IFF_LOOPBACK check
    doesn't trigger.
    
    As -m rpfilter is restricted to PREROUTING, we can check for existing
    rtable instead, it catches locally-generated broad/multicast case, too.

    commit 442fad9423b78319e0019a7f5047eddf3317afbc upstream.
    
    Userspace can cause kernel panic by not specifying orig/reply
    tuple: kernel will create a tuple with random stack values.
    
    Problem is that tuple.dst.dir will be random, too, which

    netfilter: nf_ct_helper: don't discard helper if it is actually the same
    
    commit 6e2f0aa8cf8892868bf2c19349cb5d7c407f690d upstream.
    
    commit (32f5376 netfilter: nf_ct_helper: disable automatic helper
    re-assignment of different type) broke transparent proxy scenarios.
    
    For example, initial helper lookup might yield "ftp" (dport 21),
    while re-lookup after REDIRECT yields "ftp-2121".
    
    This causes the autoassign code to toss the ftp helper, even
    though these are just different instances of the same helper.
    
    Change the test to check for the helper function address instead
    of the helper address, as suggested by Pablo.

    netfilter: nf_ct_sip: don't drop packets with offsets pointing outside the packet
    
    commit 3a7b21eaf4fb3c971bdb47a98f570550ddfe4471 upstream.
    
    Some Cisco phones create huge messages that are spread over multiple packets.
    After calculating the offset of the SIP body, it is validated to be within
    the packet and the packet is dropped otherwise. This breaks operation of
    these phones. Since connection tracking is supposed to be passive, just let
    those packets pass unmodified and untracked.

    xhci: Don't warn on empty ring for suspended devices.
    
    commit a83d6755814e4614ba77e15d82796af0f695c6b8 upstream.
    
    When a device attached to the roothub is suspended, the endpoint rings
    are stopped.  The host may generate a completion event with the
    completion code set to 'Stopped' or 'Stopped Invalid' when the ring is
    halted.  The current xHCI code prints a warning in that case, which can
    be really annoying if the USB device is coming into and out of suspend.
    
    Remove the unnecessary warning.

    e1000e: fix runtime power management transitions
    
    commit 66148babe728f3e00e13c56f6b0ecf325abd80da upstream.
    
    This patch removes redundant actions from driver and fixes its interaction
    with actions in pci-bus runtime power management code.
    
    It removes pci_save_state() from __e1000_shutdown() for normal adapters,
    PCI bus callbacks pci_pm_*() will do all this for us. Now __e1000_shutdown()
    switches to D3-state only quad-port adapters, because they needs quirk for
    clearing false-positive error from downsteam pci-e port.
    
    pci_save_state() now called after clearing bus-master bit, thus __e1000_resume()
    and e1000_io_slot_reset() must set it back after restoring configuration space.
    
    This patch set get_link_status before calling pm_runtime_put() in e1000_open()
    to allow e1000_idle() get real link status and schedule first runtime suspend.
    
    This patch also enables wakeup for device if management mode is enabled
    (like for WoL) as result pci_prepare_to_sleep() would setup wakeup without
    special actions like custom 'enable_wakeup' sign.

    PCI/PM: Clear state_saved during suspend
    
    commit 82fee4d67ab86d6fe5eb0f9a9e988ca9d654d765 upstream.
    
    This patch clears pci_dev->state_saved at the beginning of suspending.
    PCI config state may be saved long before that.  Some drivers call
    pci_save_state() from the ->probe() callback to get snapshot of sane
    configuration space to use in the ->slot_reset() callback.

    commit 13f85203e1060da83d9ec1c1c5a63343eaab8de4 upstream.
    
    Some ancient pHyp versions used to create a 8 bytes local-mac-address
    property in the device-tree instead of a 6 bytes one for veth.
    
    The Linux driver code to deal with that is an insane hack which also
    happens to break with some choices of MAC addresses in qemu by testing
    for a bit in the address rather than just looking at the size of the
    property.
    
    Sanitize this by doing the latter instead.

    hugetlbfs: fix mmap failure in unaligned size request
    
    commit af73e4d9506d3b797509f3c030e7dcd554f7d9c4 upstream.
    
    The current kernel returns -EINVAL unless a given mmap length is
    "almost" hugepage aligned.  This is because in sys_mmap_pgoff() the
    given length is passed to vm_mmap_pgoff() as it is without being aligned
    with hugepage boundary.
    
    This is a regression introduced in commit 40716e29243d ("hugetlbfs: fix
    alignment of huge page requests"), where alignment code is pushed into
    hugetlb_file_setup() and the variable len in caller side is not changed.
    
    To fix this, this patch partially reverts that commit, and adds
    alignment code in caller side.  And it also introduces hstate_sizelog()
    in order to get proper hstate to specified hugepage size.

    autofs - remove autofs dentry mount check
    
    commit ce8a5dbdf9e709bdaf4618d7ef8cceb91e8adc69 upstream.
    
    When checking if an autofs mount point is busy it isn't sufficient to
    only check if it's a mount point.
    
    For example, if the mount of an offset mountpoint in a tree is denied
    for this host by its export and the dentry becomes a process working
    directory the check incorrectly returns the mount as not in use at
    expire.
    
    This can happen since the default when mounting within a tree is
    nostrict, which means ingnore mount fails on mounts within the tree and
    continue.  The nostrict option is meant to allow mounting in this case.

    pwm: spear: Fix checking return value of clk_enable() and clk_prepare()
    
    commit 563861cd633ae52932843477bb6ca3f1c9e2f78b upstream.
    
    The logic to check return value of clk_enable() and clk_prepare() is reversed,
    fix it.

    powerpc: fix numa distance for form0 device tree
    
    commit 7122beeee7bc1757682049780179d7c216dd1c83 upstream.
    
    The following commit breaks numa distance setup for old powerpc
    systems that use form0 encoding in device tree.
    
    commit 41eab6f88f24124df89e38067b3766b7bef06ddb
    powerpc/numa: Use form 1 affinity to setup node distance
    
    Device tree node /rtas/ibm,associativity-reference-points would
    index into /cpus/PowerPCxxxx/ibm,associativity based on form0 or
    form1 encoding detected by ibm,architecture-vec-5 property.
    
    All modern systems use form1 and current kernel code is correct.
    However, on older systems with form0 encoding, the numa distance
    will get hard coded as LOCAL_DISTANCE for all nodes.  This causes
    task scheduling anomaly since scheduler will skip building numa
    level domain (topmost domain with all cpus) if all numa distances
    are same.  (value of 'level' in sched_init_numa() will remain 0)
    
    Prior to the above commit:
    ((from) == (to) ? LOCAL_DISTANCE : REMOTE_DISTANCE)
    
    Restoring compatible behavior with this patch for old powerpc systems
    with device tree where numa distance are encoded as form0.

    powerpc: Emulate non privileged DSCR read and write
    
    commit 73d2fb758e678c93bc76d40876c2359f0729b0ef upstream.
    
    POWER8 allows read and write of the DSCR in userspace. We added
    kernel emulation so applications could always use the instructions
    regardless of the CPU type.
    
    Unfortunately there are two SPRs for the DSCR and we only added
    emulation for the privileged one. Add code to match the non
    privileged one.
    
    A simple test was created to verify the fix:
    
    http://ozlabs.org/~anton/junkcode/user_dscr_test.c
    
    Without the patch we get a SIGILL and it passes with the patch.
