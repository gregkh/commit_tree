    media: r820t: fix r820t_write_reg for KASAN
    
    commit 16c3ada89cff9a8c2a0eea34ffa1aa20af3f6008 upstream.
    
    With CONFIG_KASAN, we get an overly long stack frame due to inlining
    the register access functions:
    
    drivers/media/tuners/r820t.c: In function 'generic_set_freq.isra.7':
    drivers/media/tuners/r820t.c:1334:1: error: the frame size of 2880 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
    
    This is caused by a gcc bug that has now been fixed in gcc-8.
    To work around the problem, we can pass the register data
    through a local variable that older gcc versions can optimize
    out as well.

    ARM: dts: s5pv210: add interrupt-parent for ohci
    
    commit 5c1037196b9ee75897c211972de370ed1336ec8f upstream.
    
    The ohci-hcd node has an interrupt number but no interrupt-parent,
    leading to a warning with current dtc versions:
    
    arch/arm/boot/dts/s5pv210-aquila.dtb: Warning (interrupts_property): Missing interrupt-parent for /soc/ohci@ec300000
    arch/arm/boot/dts/s5pv210-goni.dtb: Warning (interrupts_property): Missing interrupt-parent for /soc/ohci@ec300000
    arch/arm/boot/dts/s5pv210-smdkc110.dtb: Warning (interrupts_property): Missing interrupt-parent for /soc/ohci@ec300000
    arch/arm/boot/dts/s5pv210-smdkv210.dtb: Warning (interrupts_property): Missing interrupt-parent for /soc/ohci@ec300000
    arch/arm/boot/dts/s5pv210-torbreck.dtb: Warning (interrupts_property): Missing interrupt-parent for /soc/ohci@ec300000
    
    As seen from the related exynos dts files, the ohci and ehci controllers
    always share one interrupt number, and the number is the same here as
    well, so setting the same interrupt-parent is the reasonable solution
    here.

    vfs: don't do RCU lookup of empty pathnames
    
    commit c0eb027e5aef70b71e5a38ee3e264dc0b497f343 upstream.
    
    Normal pathname lookup doesn't allow empty pathnames, but using
    AT_EMPTY_PATH (with name_to_handle_at() or fstatat(), for example) you
    can trigger an empty pathname lookup.
    
    And not only is the RCU lookup in that case entirely unnecessary
    (because we'll obviously immediately finalize the end result), it is
    actively wrong.
    
    Why? An empth path is a special case that will return the original
    'dirfd' dentry - and that dentry may not actually be RCU-free'd,
    resulting in a potential use-after-free if we were to initialize the
    path lazily under the RCU read lock and depend on complete_walk()
    finalizing the dentry.
    
    Found by syzkaller and KASAN.

    x86: fix build warnign with 32-bit PAE
    
    I ran into a 4.9 build warning in randconfig testing, starting with the
    KAISER patches:
    
    arch/x86/kernel/ldt.c: In function 'alloc_ldt_struct':
    arch/x86/include/asm/pgtable_types.h:208:24: error: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type [-Werror=overflow]

          __PAGE_KERNEL);
          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    I originally ran into this last year when the patches were part of linux-next,
    and tried to work around it by using the proper 'pteval_t' types consistently,
    but that caused additional problems.
    
    This takes a much simpler approach, and makes the argument type of the dummy
    helper always 64-bit, which is wide enough for any page table layout and
    won't hurt since this call is just an empty stub anyway.

    dm: correctly handle chained bios in dec_pending()
    
    commit 8dd601fa8317243be887458c49f6c29c2f3d719f upstream.
    
    dec_pending() is given an error status (possibly 0) to be recorded
    against a bio.  It can be called several times on the one 'struct
    dm_io', and it is careful to only assign a non-zero error to
    io->status.  However when it then assigned io->status to bio->bi_status,
    it is not careful and could overwrite a genuine error status with 0.
    
    This can happen when chained bios are in use.  If a bio is chained
    beneath the bio that this dm_io is handling, the child bio might
    complete and set bio->bi_status before the dm_io completes.
    
    This has been possible since chained bios were introduced in 3.14, and
    has become a lot easier to trigger with commit 18a25da84354 ("dm: ensure
    bio submission follows a depth-first tree walk") as that commit caused
    dm to start using chained bios itself.
    
    A particular failure mode is that if a bio spans an 'error' target and a
    working target, the 'error' fragment will complete instantly and set the
    ->bi_status, and the other fragment will normally complete a little
    later, and will clear ->bi_status.
    
    The fix is simply to only assign io_error to bio->bi_status when
    io_error is not zero.

    mvpp2: fix multicast address filter
    
    commit 7ac8ff95f48cbfa609a060fd6a1e361dd62feeb3 upstream.
    
    IPv6 doesn't work on the MacchiatoBIN board. It is caused by broken
    multicast address filter in the mvpp2 driver.
    
    The driver loads doesn't load any multicast entries if "allmulti" is not
    set. This condition should be reversed.
    
    The condition !netdev_mc_empty(dev) is useless (because
    netdev_for_each_mc_addr is nop if the list is empty).
    
    This patch also fixes a possible overflow of the multicast list - if
    mvpp2_prs_mac_da_accept fails, we set the allmulti flag and retry.

    ALSA: seq: Fix racy pool initializations
    
    commit d15d662e89fc667b90cd294b0eb45694e33144da upstream.
    
    ALSA sequencer core initializes the event pool on demand by invoking
    snd_seq_pool_init() when the first write happens and the pool is
    empty.  Meanwhile user can reset the pool size manually via ioctl
    concurrently, and this may lead to UAF or out-of-bound accesses since
    the function tries to vmalloc / vfree the buffer.
    
    A simple fix is to just wrap the snd_seq_pool_init() call with the
    recently introduced client->ioctl_mutex; as the calls for
    snd_seq_pool_init() from other side are always protected with this
    mutex, we can avoid the race.

    commit fdcc968a3b290407bcba9d4c90e2fba6d8d928f1 upstream.
    
    These laptops have a combined jack to attach headsets, the U727 on
    the left, the U757 on the right, but a headsets microphone doesn't
    work. Using hdajacksensetest I found that pin 0x19 changed the
    present state when plugging the headset, in addition to 0x21, but
    didn't have the correct configuration (shown as "Not connected").
    
    So this sets the configuration to the same values as the headphone
    pin 0x21 except for the device type microphone, which makes it
    work correctly. With the patch the configured pins for U727 are
    
    Pin 0x12 (Internal Mic, Mobile-In): present = No
    Pin 0x14 (Internal Speaker): present = No
    Pin 0x19 (Black Mic, Left side): present = No
    Pin 0x1d (Internal Aux): present = No
    Pin 0x21 (Black Headphone, Left side): present = No

    rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Fix connection lost problem correctly
    
    commit c713fb071edc0efc01a955f65a006b0e1795d2eb upstream.
    
    There has been a coding error in rtl8821ae since it was first introduced,
    namely that an 8-bit register was read using a 16-bit read in
    _rtl8821ae_dbi_read(). This error was fixed with commit 40b368af4b75
    ("rtlwifi: Fix alignment issues"); however, this change led to
    instability in the connection. To restore stability, this change
    was reverted in commit b8b8b16352cd ("rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Fix connection
    lost problem").
    
    Unfortunately, the unaligned access causes machine checks in ARM
    architecture, and we were finally forced to find the actual cause of the
    problem on x86 platforms. Following a suggestion from Pkshih
    <pkshih@realtek.com>, it was found that increasing the ASPM L1
    latency from 0 to 7 fixed the instability. This parameter was varied to
    see if a smaller value would work; however, it appears that 7 is the
    safest value. A new symbol is defined for this quantity, thus it can be
    easily changed if necessary.

    device tree depth-first starting at the parent rather than just matching
    on its children.
    
    To make things worse, the parent display node was also prematurely
    freed.
    
    Note that the display and timings node references are never put after a
    successful dt-initialisation so the nodes would leak on later probe
    deferrals and on driver unbind.

    mm: hide a #warning for COMPILE_TEST
    
    commit af27d9403f5b80685b79c88425086edccecaf711 upstream.
    
    We get a warning about some slow configurations in randconfig kernels:
    
      mm/memory.c:83:2: error: #warning Unfortunate NUMA and NUMA Balancing config, growing page-frame for last_cpupid. [-Werror=cpp]
    
    The warning is reasonable by itself, but gets in the way of randconfig
    build testing, so I'm hiding it whenever CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST is set.
    
    The warning was added in 2013 in commit 75980e97dacc ("mm: fold
    page->_last_nid into page->flags where possible").

    ext4: save error to disk in __ext4_grp_locked_error()
    
    commit 06f29cc81f0350261f59643a505010531130eea0 upstream.
    
    In the function __ext4_grp_locked_error(), __save_error_info()
    is called to save error info in super block block, but does not sync
    that information to disk to info the subsequence fsck after reboot.
    
    This patch writes the error information to disk.  After this patch,
    I think there is no obvious EXT4 error handle branches which leads to
    "Remounting filesystem read-only" will leave the disk partition miss
    the subsequence fsck.

    rtc-opal: Fix handling of firmware error codes, prevent busy loops
    
    commit 5b8b58063029f02da573120ef4dc9079822e3cda upstream.
    
    According to the OPAL docs:
      skiboot-5.2.5/doc/opal-api/opal-rtc-read-3.txt
      skiboot-5.2.5/doc/opal-api/opal-rtc-write-4.txt
    
    OPAL_HARDWARE may be returned from OPAL_RTC_READ or OPAL_RTC_WRITE and
    this indicates either a transient or permanent error.
    
    Prior to this patch, Linux was not dealing with OPAL_HARDWARE being a
    permanent error particularly well, in that you could end up in a busy
    loop.
    
    This was not too hard to trigger on an AMI BMC based OpenPOWER machine
    doing a continuous "ipmitool mc reset cold" to the BMC, the result of
    that being that we'd get stuck in an infinite loop in
    opal_get_rtc_time().
    
    We now retry a few times before returning the error higher up the
    stack.

    commit 24dbc6000f4b9b0ef5a9daecb161f1907733765a upstream.
    
    Currently, x86_cache_size is of type int, which makes no sense as we
    will never have a valid cache size equal or less than 0. So instead of
    initializing this variable to -1, it can perfectly be initialized to 0
    and use it as an unsigned variable instead.

    KVM/x86: Reduce retpoline performance impact in slot_handle_level_range(), by always inlining iterator helper methods
    
    commit 928a4c39484281f8ca366f53a1db79330d058401 upstream.
    
    With retpoline, tight loops of "call this function for every XXX" are
    very much pessimised by taking a prediction miss *every* time. This one
    is by far the biggest contributor to the guest launch time with retpoline.
    
    By marking the iterator slot_handle_…() functions always_inline, we can
    ensure that the indirect function call can be optimised away into a
    direct call and it actually generates slightly smaller code because
    some of the other conditionals can get optimised away too.
    
    Performance is now pretty close to what we see with nospectre_v2 on
    the command line.

    ALSA: seq: Fix regression by incorrect ioctl_mutex usages
    
    This is the revised backport of the upstream commit
    b3defb791b26ea0683a93a4f49c77ec45ec96f10
    
    We had another backport (e.g. 623e5c8ae32b in 4.4.115), but it applies
    the new mutex also to the code paths that are invoked via faked
    kernel-to-kernel ioctls.  As reported recently, this leads to a
    deadlock at suspend (or other scenarios triggering the kernel
    sequencer client).
    
    This patch addresses the issue by taking the mutex only in the code
    paths invoked by user-space, just like the original fix patch does.

    IB/mlx4: Fix incorrectly releasing steerable UD QPs when have only ETH ports
    
    commit 852f6927594d0d3e8632c889b2ab38cbc46476ad upstream.
    
    Allocating steerable UD QPs depends on having at least one IB port,
    while releasing those QPs does not.
    
    As a result, when there are only ETH ports, the IB (RoCE) driver
    requests releasing a qp range whose base qp is zero, with
    qp count zero.
    
    When SR-IOV is enabled, and the VF driver is running on a VM over
    a hypervisor which treats such qp release calls as errors
    (rather than NOPs), we see lines in the VM message log like:
    
     mlx4_core 0002:00:02.0: Failed to release qp range base:0 cnt:0
    
    Fix this by adding a check for a zero count in mlx4_release_qp_range()
    (which thus treats releasing 0 qps as a nop), and eliminating the
    check for device managed flow steering when releasing steerable UD QPs.
    (Freeing ib_uc_qpns_bitmap unconditionally is also OK, since it
    remains NULL when steerable UD QPs are not allocated).
