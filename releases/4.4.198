    RDMA/cxgb4: Do not dma memory off of the stack
    
    commit 3840c5b78803b2b6cc1ff820100a74a092c40cbb upstream.
    
    Nicolas pointed out that the cxgb4 driver is doing dma off of the stack,
    which is generally considered a very bad thing.  On some architectures it
    could be a security problem, but odds are none of them actually run this
    driver, so it's just a "normal" bug.
    
    Resolve this by allocating the memory for a message off of the heap
    instead of the stack.  kmalloc() always will give us a proper memory
    location that DMA will work correctly from.

    net: sched: Fix memory exposure from short TCA_U32_SEL
    
    commit 98c8f125fd8a6240ea343c1aa50a1be9047791b8 upstream.
    
    Via u32_change(), TCA_U32_SEL has an unspecified type in the netlink
    policy, so max length isn't enforced, only minimum. This means nkeys
    (from userspace) was being trusted without checking the actual size of
    nla_len(), which could lead to a memory over-read, and ultimately an
    exposure via a call to u32_dump(). Reachability is CAP_NET_ADMIN within
    a namespace.

    PCI: PM: Fix pci_power_up()
    
    commit 45144d42f299455911cc29366656c7324a3a7c97 upstream.
    
    There is an arbitrary difference between the system resume and
    runtime resume code paths for PCI devices regarding the delay to
    apply when switching the devices from D3cold to D0.
    
    Namely, pci_restore_standard_config() used in the runtime resume
    code path calls pci_set_power_state() which in turn invokes
    __pci_start_power_transition() to power up the device through the
    platform firmware and that function applies the transition delay
    (as per PCI Express Base Specification Revision 2.0, Section 6.6.1).
    However, pci_pm_default_resume_early() used in the system resume
    code path calls pci_power_up() which doesn't apply the delay at
    all and that causes issues to occur during resume from
    suspend-to-idle on some systems where the delay is required.
    
    Since there is no reason for that difference to exist, modify
    pci_power_up() to follow pci_set_power_state() more closely and
    invoke __pci_start_power_transition() from there to call the
    platform firmware to power up the device (in case that's necessary).

    cpufreq: Avoid cpufreq_suspend() deadlock on system shutdown
    
    commit 65650b35133ff20f0c9ef0abd5c3c66dbce3ae57 upstream.
    
    It is incorrect to set the cpufreq syscore shutdown callback pointer
    to cpufreq_suspend(), because that function cannot be run in the
    syscore stage of system shutdown for two reasons: (a) it may attempt
    to carry out actions depending on devices that have already been shut
    down at that point and (b) the RCU synchronization carried out by it
    may not be able to make progress then.
    
    The latter issue has been present since commit 45975c7d21a1 ("rcu:
    Define RCU-sched API in terms of RCU for Tree RCU PREEMPT builds"),
    but the former one has been there since commit 90de2a4aa9f3 ("cpufreq:
    suspend cpufreq governors on shutdown") regardless.
    
    Fix that by dropping cpufreq_syscore_ops altogether and making
    device_shutdown() call cpufreq_suspend() directly before shutting
    down devices, which is along the lines of what system-wide power
    management does.

    btrfs: block-group: Fix a memory leak due to missing btrfs_put_block_group()
    
    commit 4b654acdae850f48b8250b9a578a4eaa518c7a6f upstream.
    
    In btrfs_read_block_groups(), if we have an invalid block group which
    has mixed type (DATA|METADATA) while the fs doesn't have MIXED_GROUPS
    feature, we error out without freeing the block group cache.
    
    This patch will add the missing btrfs_put_block_group() to prevent
    memory leak.

    CIFS: avoid using MID 0xFFFF
    
    commit 03d9a9fe3f3aec508e485dd3dcfa1e99933b4bdb upstream.
    
    According to MS-CIFS specification MID 0xFFFF should not be used by the
    CIFS client, but we actually do. Besides, this has proven to cause races
    leading to oops between SendReceive2/cifs_demultiplex_thread. On SMB1,
    MID is a 2 byte value easy to reach in CurrentMid which may conflict with
    an oplock break notification request coming from server

    mm/slub: fix a deadlock in show_slab_objects()
    
    commit e4f8e513c3d353c134ad4eef9fd0bba12406c7c8 upstream.
    
    A long time ago we fixed a similar deadlock in show_slab_objects() [1].
    However, it is apparently due to the commits like 01fb58bcba63 ("slab:
    remove synchronous synchronize_sched() from memcg cache deactivation
    path") and 03afc0e25f7f ("slab: get_online_mems for
    kmem_cache_{create,destroy,shrink}"), this kind of deadlock is back by
    just reading files in /sys/kernel/slab which will generate a lockdep
    splat below.
    
    Since the "mem_hotplug_lock" here is only to obtain a stable online node
    mask while racing with NUMA node hotplug, in the worst case, the results
    may me miscalculated while doing NUMA node hotplug, but they shall be
    corrected by later reads of the same files.

    I think it is important to mention that this doesn't expose the
    show_slab_objects to use-after-free.  There is only a single path that
    might really race here and that is the slab hotplug notifier callback
    __kmem_cache_shrink (via slab_mem_going_offline_callback) but that path
    doesn't really destroy kmem_cache_node data structures.

    scsi: zfcp: fix reaction on bit error threshold notification
    
    [ Upstream commit 2190168aaea42c31bff7b9a967e7b045f07df095 ]
    
    On excessive bit errors for the FCP channel ingress fibre path, the channel
    notifies us.  Previously, we only emitted a kernel message and a trace
    record.  Since performance can become suboptimal with I/O timeouts due to
    bit errors, we now stop using an FCP device by default on channel
    notification so multipath on top can timely failover to other paths.  A new
    module parameter zfcp.ber_stop can be used to get zfcp old behavior.
    
    User explanation of new kernel message:
    
     * Description:
     * The FCP channel reported that its bit error threshold has been exceeded.
     * These errors might result from a problem with the physical components
     * of the local fibre link into the FCP channel.
     * The problem might be damage or malfunction of the cable or
     * cable connection between the FCP channel and
     * the adjacent fabric switch port or the point-to-point peer.
     * Find details about the errors in the HBA trace for the FCP device.
     * The zfcp device driver closed down the FCP device
     * to limit the performance impact from possible I/O command timeouts.
     * User action:
     * Check for problems on the local fibre link, ensure that fibre optics are
     * clean and functional, and all cables are properly plugged.
     * After the repair action, you can manually recover the FCP device by
     * writing "0" into its "failed" sysfs attribute.
     * If recovery through sysfs is not possible, set the CHPID of the device
     * offline and back online on the service element.

    Although this shouldn't occur in practice, it's a good idea to bounds

    ASoC: rsnd: Reinitialize bit clock inversion flag for every format setting
    
    commit 22e58665a01006d05f0239621f7d41cacca96cc4 upstream.
    
    Unlike other format-related DAI parameters, rdai->bit_clk_inv flag
    is not properly re-initialized when setting format for new stream
    processing. The inversion, if requested, is then applied not to default,
    but to a previous value, which leads to SCKP bit in SSICR register being
    set incorrectly.
    Fix this by re-setting the flag to its initial value, determined by format.

    USB: ldusb: fix read info leaks
    
    commit 7a6f22d7479b7a0b68eadd308a997dd64dda7dae upstream.
    
    Fix broken read implementation, which could be used to trigger slab info
    leaks.
    
    The driver failed to check if the custom ring buffer was still empty
    when waking up after having waited for more data. This would happen on
    every interrupt-in completion, even if no data had been added to the
    ring buffer (e.g. on disconnect events).
    
    Due to missing sanity checks and uninitialised (kmalloced) ring-buffer
    entries, this meant that huge slab info leaks could easily be triggered.
    
    Note that the empty-buffer check after wakeup is enough to fix the info
    leak on disconnect, but let's clear the buffer on allocation and add a
    sanity check to read() to prevent further leaks.

    usb: udc: lpc32xx: fix bad bit shift operation
    
    commit b987b66ac3a2bc2f7b03a0ba48a07dc553100c07 upstream.
    
    It seems that the right variable to use in this case is *i*, instead of
    *n*, otherwise there is an undefined behavior when right shifiting by more
    than 31 bits when multiplying n by 8; notice that *n* can take values
    equal or greater than 4 (4, 8, 16, ...).
    
    Also, notice that under the current conditions (bl = 3), we are skiping
    the handling of bytes 3, 7, 31... So, fix this by updating this logic
    and limit *bl* up to 4 instead of up to 3.
    
    This fix is based on function udc_stuff_fifo().

    The problem does not occur in mainline due to the XArray rewrite which
    changed the locking to exclude modification of the tree during iteration.
    At the time, nobody realised this was a bugfix.  Backport the locking

    ipv4: Return -ENETUNREACH if we can't create route but saddr is valid
    
    [ Upstream commit 595e0651d0296bad2491a4a29a7a43eae6328b02 ]
    
    ...instead of -EINVAL. An issue was found with older kernel versions
    while unplugging a NFS client with pending RPCs, and the wrong error
    code here prevented it from recovering once link is back up with a
    configured address.
    
    Incidentally, this is not an issue anymore since commit 4f8943f80883
    ("SUNRPC: Replace direct task wakeups from softirq context"), included
    in 5.2-rc7, had the effect of decoupling the forwarding of this error
    by using SO_ERROR in xs_wake_error(), as pointed out by Benjamin
    Coddington.
    
    To the best of my knowledge, this isn't currently causing any further
    issue, but the error code doesn't look appropriate anyway, and we
    might hit this in other paths as well.
    
    In detail, as analysed by Gonzalo Siero, once the route is deleted
    because the interface is down, and can't be resolved and we return
    -EINVAL here, this ends up, courtesy of inet_sk_rebuild_header(),
    as the socket error seen by tcp_write_err(), called by
    tcp_retransmit_timer().
    
    In turn, tcp_write_err() indirectly calls xs_error_report(), which
    wakes up the RPC pending tasks with a status of -EINVAL. This is then
    seen by call_status() in the SUN RPC implementation, which aborts the
    RPC call calling rpc_exit(), instead of handling this as a
    potentially temporary condition, i.e. as a timeout.
    
    Return -EINVAL only if the input parameters passed to
    ip_route_output_key_hash_rcu() are actually invalid (this is the case
    if the specified source address is multicast, limited broadcast or
    all zeroes), but return -ENETUNREACH in all cases where, at the given
    moment, the given source address doesn't allow resolving the route.
    
    While at it, drop the initialisation of err to -ENETUNREACH, which
    was added to __ip_route_output_key() back then by commit
    0315e3827048 ("net: Fix behaviour of unreachable, blackhole and
    prohibit routes"), but actually had no effect, as it was, and is,
    overwritten by the fib_lookup() return code assignment, and anyway
    ignored in all other branches, including the if (fl4->saddr) one:
    I find this rather confusing, as it would look like -ENETUNREACH is
    the "default" error, while that statement has no effect.
    
    Also note that after commit fc75fc8339e7 ("ipv4: dont create routes
    on down devices"), we would get -ENETUNREACH if the device is down,
    but -EINVAL if the source address is specified and we can't resolve
    the route, and this appears to be rather inconsistent.

    net: avoid potential infinite loop in tc_ctl_action()
    
    [ Upstream commit 39f13ea2f61b439ebe0060393e9c39925c9ee28c ]
    
    tc_ctl_action() has the ability to loop forever if tcf_action_add()
    returns -EAGAIN.
    
    This special case has been done in case a module needed to be loaded,
    but it turns out that tcf_add_notify() could also return -EAGAIN
    if the socket sk_rcvbuf limit is hit.
    
    We need to separate the two cases, and only loop for the module
    loading case.
    
    While we are at it, add a limit of 10 attempts since unbounded
    loops are always scary.
    
    syzbot repro was something like :
    
    socket(PF_NETLINK, SOCK_RAW|SOCK_NONBLOCK, NETLINK_ROUTE) = 3
    write(3, ..., 38) = 38
    setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF, [0], 4) = 0
    sendmsg(3, {msg_name(0)=NULL, msg_iov(1)=[{..., 388}], msg_controllen=0, msg_flags=0x10}, ...)

        [...] __do_sys_setsockopt net/socket.c:2100 [inline]
    
    It was caused by when sending msgs without binding a port, in the path:
    inet_sendmsg() -> inet_send_prepare() -> inet_autobind() ->
    .get_port/sctp_get_port(), sp->bind_hash will be set while bp->port is
    not. Later when binding another port by sctp_setsockopt_bindx(), a new
    bucket will be created as bp->port is not set.
    
    sctp's autobind is supposed to call sctp_autobind() where it does all
    things including setting bp->port. Since sctp_autobind() is called in
    sctp_sendmsg() if the sk is not yet bound, it should have skipped the
    auto bind.
    
    THis patch is to avoid calling inet_autobind() in inet_send_prepare()
    by changing sctp_prot .no_autobind with true, also remove the unused
    .get_port.

    loop: Add LOOP_SET_DIRECT_IO to compat ioctl
    
    [ Upstream commit fdbe4eeeb1aac219b14f10c0ed31ae5d1123e9b8 ]
    
    Enabling Direct I/O with loop devices helps reducing memory usage by
    avoiding double caching.  32 bit applications running on 64 bits systems
    are currently not able to request direct I/O because is missing from the
    lo_compat_ioctl.
    
    This patch fixes the compatibility issue mentioned above by exporting
    LOOP_SET_DIRECT_IO as additional lo_compat_ioctl() entry.
    The input argument for this ioctl is a single long converted to a 1-bit
    boolean, so compatibility is preserved.

    namespace: fix namespace.pl script to support relative paths
    
    [ Upstream commit 82fdd12b95727640c9a8233c09d602e4518e71f7 ]
    
    The namespace.pl script does not work properly if objtree is not set to
    an absolute path. The do_nm function is run from within the find
    function, which changes directories.
    
    Because of this, appending objtree, $File::Find::dir, and $source, will
    return a path which is not valid from the current directory.
    
    This used to work when objtree was set to an absolute path when using
    "make namespacecheck". It appears to have not worked when calling
    ./scripts/namespace.pl directly.
    
    This behavior was changed in 7e1c04779efd ("kbuild: Use relative path
    for $(objtree)", 2014-05-14)
    
    Rather than fixing the Makefile to set objtree to an absolute path, just
    fix namespace.pl to work when srctree and objtree are relative. Also fix
    the script to use an absolute path for these by default.
    
    Use the File::Spec module for this purpose. It's been part of perl
    5 since 5.005.
    
    The curdir() function is used to get the current directory when the
    objtree and srctree aren't set in the environment.
    
    rel2abs() is used to convert possibly relative objtree and srctree
    environment variables to absolute paths.
    
    Finally, the catfile() function is used instead of string appending
    paths together, since this is more robust when joining paths together.

    nl80211: fix null pointer dereference
    
    [ Upstream commit b501426cf86e70649c983c52f4c823b3c40d72a3 ]
    
    If the interface is not in MESH mode, the command 'iw wlanx mpath del'
    will cause kernel panic.
    
    The root cause is null pointer access in mpp_flush_by_proxy(), as the
    pointer 'sdata->u.mesh.mpp_paths' is NULL for non MESH interface.

    Set memory bandwidth limit to filter out resolutions above 720p@60Hz to
    avoid underflow errors due to the bandwidth needs of higher resolutions.
    
    am43xx can not provide enough bandwidth to DISPC to correctly handle
    'high' resolutions.

    ARM: OMAP2+: Fix missing reset done flag for am3 and am43
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ad8041b98c665b6147e607b749586d6e20ba73a ]
    
    For ti,sysc-omap4 compatible devices with no sysstatus register, we do have
    reset done status available in the SOFTRESET bit that clears when the reset
    is done. This is documented for example in am437x TRM for DMTIMER_TIOCP_CFG
    register. The am335x TRM just says that SOFTRESET bit value 1 means reset is
    ongoing, but it behaves the same way clearing after reset is done.
    
    With the ti-sysc driver handling this automatically based on no sysstatus
    register defined, we see warnings if SYSC_HAS_RESET_STATUS is missing in the
    legacy platform data:
    
    ti-sysc 48042000.target-module: sysc_flags 00000222 != 00000022
    ti-sysc 48044000.target-module: sysc_flags 00000222 != 00000022
    ti-sysc 48046000.target-module: sysc_flags 00000222 != 00000022
    ...
    
    Let's fix these warnings by adding SYSC_HAS_RESET_STATUS. Let's also
    remove the useless parentheses while at it.
    
    If it turns out we do have ti,sysc-omap4 compatible devices without a
    working SOFTRESET bit we can set up additional quirk handling for it.

    There are instances, though rare, where a LOGO request cannot be sent out
    and the thread in free session done can wait indefinitely. Fix this by
    putting an upper bound to sleep.

    scsi: ufs: skip shutdown if hba is not powered
    
    [ Upstream commit f51913eef23f74c3bd07899dc7f1ed6df9e521d8 ]
    
    In some cases, hba may go through shutdown flow without successful
    initialization and then make system hang.
    
    For example, if ufshcd_change_power_mode() gets error and leads to
    ufshcd_hba_exit() to release resources of the host, future shutdown flow
    may hang the system since the host register will be accessed in unpowered
    state.
    
    To solve this issue, simply add checking to skip shutdown for above kind of
    situation.
