    IB/cm: Fix rb-tree duplicate free and use-after-free
    
    commit 0ca81a2840f77855bbad1b9f172c545c4dc9e6a4 upstream.
    
    ib_send_cm_sidr_rep could sometimes erase the node from the sidr
    (depending on errors in the process). Since ib_send_cm_sidr_rep is
    called both from cm_sidr_req_handler and cm_destroy_id, cm_id_priv
    could be either erased from the rb_tree twice or not erased at all.
    Fixing that by making sure it's erased only once before freeing
    cm_id_priv.

    crypto: api - Only abort operations on fatal signal
    
    commit 3fc89adb9fa4beff31374a4bf50b3d099d88ae83 upstream.
    
    Currently a number of Crypto API operations may fail when a signal
    occurs.  This causes nasty problems as the caller of those operations
    are often not in a good position to restart the operation.
    
    In fact there is currently no need for those operations to be
    interrupted by user signals at all.  All we need is for them to
    be killable.
    
    This patch replaces the relevant calls of signal_pending with
    fatal_signal_pending, and wait_for_completion_interruptible with
    wait_for_completion_killable, respectively.

    module: Fix locking in symbol_put_addr()
    
    commit 275d7d44d802ef271a42dc87ac091a495ba72fc5 upstream.
    
    Poma (on the way to another bug) reported an assertion triggering:
    
      [<ffffffff81150529>] module_assert_mutex_or_preempt+0x49/0x90
      [<ffffffff81150822>] __module_address+0x32/0x150

      [<ffffffffa04b77ad>] dvb_frontend_detach+0x7d/0x90 [dvb_core]
    
    Laura Abbott <labbott@redhat.com> produced a patch which lead us to
    inspect symbol_put_addr(). This function has a comment claiming it
    doesn't need to disable preemption around the module lookup
    because it holds a reference to the module it wants to find, which
    therefore cannot go away.
    
    This is wrong (and a false optimization too, preempt_disable() is really
    rather cheap, and I doubt any of this is on uber critical paths,
    otherwise it would've retained a pointer to the actual module anyway and
    avoided the second lookup).
    
    While its true that the module cannot go away while we hold a reference
    on it, the data structure we do the lookup in very much _CAN_ change
    while we do the lookup. Therefore fix the comment and add the
    required preempt_disable().

    dm btree remove: fix a bug when rebalancing nodes after removal
    
    commit 2871c69e025e8bc507651d5a9cf81a8a7da9d24b upstream.
    
    Commit 4c7e309340ff ("dm btree remove: fix bug in redistribute3") wasn't
    a complete fix for redistribute3().
    
    The redistribute3 function takes 3 btree nodes and shares out the entries
    evenly between them.  If the three nodes in total contained
    (MAX_ENTRIES * 3) - 1 entries between them then this was erroneously getting
    rebalanced as (MAX_ENTRIES - 1) on the left and right, and (MAX_ENTRIES + 1) in
    the center.
    
    Fix this issue by being more careful about calculating the target number
    of entries for the left and right nodes.

    Revert "ARM64: unwind: Fix PC calculation"
    
    commit 9702970c7bd3e2d6fecb642a190269131d4ac16c upstream.
    
    This reverts commit e306dfd06fcb44d21c80acb8e5a88d55f3d1cf63.
    
    With this patch applied, we were the only architecture making this sort
    of adjustment to the PC calculation in the unwinder. This causes
    problems for ftrace, where the PC values are matched against the
    contents of the stack frames in the callchain and fail to match any
    records after the address adjustment.
    
    Whilst there has been some effort to change ftrace to workaround this,
    those patches are not yet ready for mainline and, since we're the odd
    architecture in this regard, let's just step in line with other
    architectures (like arch/arm/) for now.

    rbd: prevent kernel stack blow up on rbd map
    
    commit 6d69bb536bac0d403d83db1ca841444981b280cd upstream.
    
    Mapping an image with a long parent chain (e.g. image foo, whose parent
    is bar, whose parent is baz, etc) currently leads to a kernel stack
    overflow, due to the following recursion in the reply path:
    
      rbd_osd_req_callback()
        rbd_obj_request_complete()
          rbd_img_obj_callback()
            rbd_img_parent_read_callback()
              rbd_obj_request_complete()
                ...
    
    Limit the parent chain to 16 images, which is ~5K worth of stack.  When
    the above recursion is eliminated, this limit can be lifted.

    rbd: don't leak parent_spec in rbd_dev_probe_parent()
    
    commit 1f2c6651f69c14d0d3a9cfbda44ea101b02160ba upstream.
    
    Currently we leak parent_spec and trigger a "parent reference
    underflow" warning if rbd_dev_create() in rbd_dev_probe_parent() fails.
    The problem is we take the !parent out_err branch and that only drops
    refcounts; parent_spec that would've been freed had we called
    rbd_dev_unparent() remains and triggers rbd_warn() in
    rbd_dev_parent_put() - at that point we have parent_spec != NULL and
    parent_ref == 0, so counter ends up being -1 after the decrement.
    
    Redo rbd_dev_probe_parent() to fix this.

    rbd: require stable pages if message data CRCs are enabled
    
    commit bae818ee1577c27356093901a0ea48f672eda514 upstream.
    
    rbd requires stable pages, as it performs a crc of the page data before
    they are send to the OSDs.
    
    But since kernel 3.9 (patch 1d1d1a767206fbe5d4c69493b7e6d2a8d08cc0a0
    "mm: only enforce stable page writes if the backing device requires
    it") it is not assumed anymore that block devices require stable pages.
    
    This patch sets the necessary flag to get stable pages back for rbd.
    
    In a ceph installation that provides multiple ext4 formatted rbd
    devices "bad crc" messages appeared regularly (ca 1 message every 1-2
    minutes on every OSD that provided the data for the rbd) in the
    OSD-logs before this patch. After this patch this messages are pretty
    much gone (only ca 1-2 / month / OSD).

    drm/nouveau/gem: return only valid domain when there's only one
    
    commit 2a6c521bb41ce862e43db46f52e7681d33e8d771 upstream.
    
    On nv50+, we restrict the valid domains to just the one where the buffer
    was originally created. However after the buffer is evicted to system
    memory, we might move it back to a different domain that was not
    originally valid. When sharing the buffer and retrieving its GEM_INFO
    data, we still want the domain that will be valid for this buffer in a
    pushbuf, not the one where it currently happens to be.
    
    This resolves fdo#92504 and several others. These are due to suspend
    evicting all buffers, making it more likely that they temporarily end up
    in the wrong place.

    mm: make sendfile(2) killable
    
    commit 296291cdd1629c308114504b850dc343eabc2782 upstream.
    
    Currently a simple program below issues a sendfile(2) system call which
    takes about 62 days to complete in my test KVM instance.
    
            int fd;
            off_t off = 0;
    
            fd = open("file", O_RDWR | O_TRUNC | O_SYNC | O_CREAT, 0644);
            ftruncate(fd, 2);
            lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END);
            sendfile(fd, fd, &off, 0xfffffff);
    
    Now you should not ask kernel to do a stupid stuff like copying 256MB in
    2-byte chunks and call fsync(2) after each chunk but if you do, sysadmin
    should have a way to stop you.
    
    We actually do have a check for fatal_signal_pending() in
    generic_perform_write() which triggers in this path however because we
    always succeed in writing something before the check is done, we return
    value > 0 from generic_perform_write() and thus the information about
    signal gets lost.
    
    Fix the problem by doing the signal check before writing anything.  That
    way generic_perform_write() returns -EINTR, the error gets propagated up
    and the sendfile loop terminates early.

    powerpc/rtas: Validate rtas.entry before calling enter_rtas()
    
    commit 8832317f662c06f5c06e638f57bfe89a71c9b266 upstream.
    
    Currently we do not validate rtas.entry before calling enter_rtas(). This
    leads to a kernel oops when user space calls rtas system call on a powernv
    platform (see below). This patch adds code to validate rtas.entry before
    making enter_rtas() call.

    iommu/amd: Don't clear DTE flags when modifying it
    
    commit cbf3ccd09d683abf1cacd36e3640872ee912d99b upstream.
    
    During device assignment/deassignment the flags in the DTE
    get lost, which might cause spurious faults, for example
    when the device tries to access the system management range.
    Fix this by not clearing the flags with the rest of the DTE.

    iwlwifi: mvm: fix D3 firmware PN programming
    
    commit 2cf5eb3ab7bb7f2e3a70edcef236cd62c87db030 upstream.
    
    The code to send the RX PN data (for each TID) to the firmware
    has a devastating bug: it overwrites the data for TID 0 with
    all the TID data, leaving the remaining TIDs zeroed. This will
    allow replays to actually be accepted by the firmware, which
    could allow waking up the system.

    ath9k: declare required extra tx headroom
    
    commit 029cd0370241641eb70235d205aa0b90c84dce44 upstream.
    
    ath9k inserts padding between the 802.11 header and the data area (to
    align it). Since it didn't declare this extra required headroom, this
    led to some nasty issues like randomly dropped packets in some setups.
