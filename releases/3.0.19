    USB: cp210x: fix CP2104 baudrate usage
    
    commit 7f482fc88ac47662228d6b1f05759797c8936a30 upstream.
    
    This fix changes the way baudrates are set on the CP210x devices from
    Silicon Labs. The CP2101/2/3 will respond to both a GET/SET_BAUDDIV
    command, and GET/SET_BAUDRATE command, while CP2104 and higher devices
    only respond to GET/SET_BAUDRATE. The current cp210x.ko driver in
    kernel version 3.2.0 only implements the GET/SET_BAUDDIV command.
    
    This patch implements the two new codes for the GET/SET_BAUDRATE
    commands. Then there is a change in the way that the baudrate is
    assigned or retrieved. This is done according to the CP210x USB
    specification in AN571. This document can be found here:
    http://www.silabs.com/pages/DownloadDoc.aspx?FILEURL=Support%20Documents/TechnicalDocs/AN571.pdf&src=DocumentationWebPart
    
    Sections 5.3/5.4 describe the USB packets for the old baudrate method.
    Sections 5.5/5.6 describe the USB packets for the new method. This
    patch also implements the new request scheme, and eliminates the
    unnecessary baudrate calculations since it uses the "actual baudrate"
    method.
    
    This patch solves the problem reported for the CP2104 in bug 42586,
    and also keeps support for all other devices (CP2101/2/3).
    
    This patchfile is also attached to the bug report on
    bugzilla.kernel.org. This patch has been developed and test on the
    3.2.0 mainline kernel version under Ubuntu 10.11.

    tcp: fix tcp_trim_head() to adjust segment count with skb MSS
    
    [ Upstream commit 5b35e1e6e9ca651e6b291c96d1106043c9af314a ]
    
    This commit fixes tcp_trim_head() to recalculate the number of
    segments in the skb with the skb's existing MSS, so trimming the head
    causes the skb segment count to be monotonically non-increasing - it
    should stay the same or go down, but not increase.
    
    Previously tcp_trim_head() used the current MSS of the connection. But
    if there was a decrease in MSS between original transmission and ACK
    (e.g. due to PMTUD), this could cause tcp_trim_head() to
    counter-intuitively increase the segment count when trimming bytes off
    the head of an skb. This violated assumptions in tcp_tso_acked() that
    tcp_trim_head() only decreases the packet count, so that packets_acked
    in tcp_tso_acked() could underflow, leading tcp_clean_rtx_queue() to
    pass u32 pkts_acked values as large as 0xffffffff to
    ca_ops->pkts_acked().
    
    As an aside, if tcp_trim_head() had really wanted the skb to reflect
    the current MSS, it should have called tcp_set_skb_tso_segs()
    unconditionally, since a decrease in MSS would mean that a
    single-packet skb should now be sliced into multiple segments.

    rds: Make rds_sock_lock BH rather than IRQ safe.
    
    [ Upstream commit efc3dbc37412c027e363736b4f4c74ee5e8ecffc ]
    
    rds_sock_info() triggers locking warnings because we try to perform a
    local_bh_enable() (via sock_i_ino()) while hardware interrupts are
    disabled (via taking rds_sock_lock).
    
    There is no reason for rds_sock_lock to be a hardware IRQ disabling
    lock, none of these access paths run in hardware interrupt context.
    
    Therefore making it a BH disabling lock is safe and sufficient to
    fix this bug.

    Several problems fixed in this patch :
    
    1) Target of the conditional jump in case a divide by 0 is performed
       by a bpf is wrong.
    
    2) Must 'generate' the full function prologue/epilogue at pass=0,
       or else we can stop too early in pass=1 if the proglen doesnt change.
       (if the increase of prologue/epilogue equals decrease of all
        instructions length because some jumps are converted to near jumps)
    
    3) Change the wrong length detection at the end of code generation to
       issue a more explicit message, no need for a full stack trace.

    l2tp: l2tp_ip - fix possible oops on packet receive
    
    [ Upstream commit 68315801dbf3ab2001679fd2074c9dc5dcf87dfa ]
    
    When a packet is received on an L2TP IP socket (L2TPv3 IP link
    encapsulation), the l2tpip socket's backlog_rcv function calls
    xfrm4_policy_check(). This is not necessary, since it was called
    before the skb was added to the backlog. With CONFIG_NET_NS enabled,
    xfrm4_policy_check() will oops if skb->dev is null, so this trivial
    patch removes the call.
    
    This bug has always been present, but only when CONFIG_NET_NS is
    enabled does it cause problems. Most users are probably using UDP
    encapsulation for L2TP, hence the problem has only recently
    surfaced.

    bonding: fix enslaving in alb mode when link down
    
    [ Upstream commit b924551bed09f61b64f21bffe241afc5526b091a ]
    
    bond_alb_init_slave() is called from bond_enslave() and sets the slave's MAC
    address. This is done differently for TLB and ALB modes.
    bond->alb_info.rlb_enabled is used to discriminate between the two modes but
    this flag may be uninitialized if the slave is being enslaved prior to calling
    bond_open() -> bond_alb_initialize() on the master.
    
    It turns out all the callers of alb_set_slave_mac_addr() pass
    bond->alb_info.rlb_enabled as the hw parameter.
    
    This patch cleans up the unnecessary parameter of alb_set_slave_mac_addr() and
    makes the function decide based on the bonding mode instead, which fixes the
    above problem.

    net caif: Register properly as a pernet subsystem.
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a8ee9aff6c3077dd9c2c7a77478e8ed362b96c6 ]
    
    caif is a subsystem and as such it needs to register with
    register_pernet_subsys instead of register_pernet_device.
    
    Among other problems using register_pernet_device was resulting in
    net_generic being called before the caif_net structure was allocated.
    Which has been causing net_generic to fail with either BUG_ON's or by
    return NULL pointers.
    
    A more ugly problem that could be caused is packets in flight why the
    subsystem is shutting down.
    
    To remove confusion also remove the cruft cause by inappropriately
    trying to fix this bug.
    
    With the aid of the previous patch I have tested this patch and
    confirmed that using register_pernet_subsys makes the failure go away as
    it should.

    netns: Fail conspicously if someone uses net_generic at an inappropriate time.
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ee4433efe99b9f39f6eff5052a177bbcfe72cea ]
    
    By definition net_generic should never be called when it can return
    NULL.  Fail conspicously with a BUG_ON to make it clear when people mess
    up that a NULL return should never happen.
    
    Recently there was a bug in the CAIF subsystem where it was registered
    with register_pernet_device instead of register_pernet_subsys.  It was
    erroneously concluded that net_generic could validly return NULL and
    that net_assign_generic was buggy (when it was just inefficient).
    Hopefully this BUG_ON will prevent people to coming to similar erroneous
    conclusions in the futrue.

    USB: cdc-wdm: Avoid hanging on interface with no USB_CDC_DMM_TYPE
    
    commit 15699e6fafc3a90e5fdc2ef30555a04dee62286f upstream.
    
    The probe does not strictly require the USB_CDC_DMM_TYPE
    descriptor, which is a good thing as it makes the driver
    usable on non-conforming interfaces.  A user could e.g.
    bind to it to a CDC ECM interface by using the new_id and
    bind sysfs files.  But this would fail with a 0 buffer length
    due to the missing descriptor.
    
    Fix by defining a reasonable fallback size: The minimum
    device receive buffer size required by the CDC WMC standard,
    revision 1.1

    commit cf840551a884360841bd3d3ce1ad0868ff0b759a upstream.
    
    When a TD length mismatch is found during isoc TRB enqueue, it directly

    and the ring should be cleared.
    
    This should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.36, which contain the

    xhci: Fix USB 3.0 device restart on resume.
    
    commit d0cd5d482b8a6dc92c6c69a5387baf72ea84f23a upstream.
    
    The xHCI hub port code gets passed a zero-based port number by the USB
    core.  It then adds one to in order to find a device slot by port number
    and device speed by calling xhci_find_slot_id_by_port.  That function
    clearly states it requires a one-based port number.  The xHCI port
    status change event handler was using a zero-based port number that it
    got from find_faked_portnum_from_hw_portnum, not a one-based port
    number.  This lead to the doorbells never being rung for a device after
    a resume, or worse, a different device with the same speed having its
    doorbell rung (which could lead to bad power management in the xHCI host
    controller).
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.39.

    commit bf9c05d5b6d19b3e4c9fe21047694e94f48db89b upstream.
    
    The assignment of handle in vmw_framebuffer_create_handle doesn't actually do anything useful and is incorrectly assigning an integer value to a pointer argument. It appears that this is a typo and should be dereferencing handle rather than assigning to it directly. This fixes a bug where an undefined handle value is potentially returned to user-space.

    jsm: Fixed EEH recovery error
    
    commit 26aa38cafae0dbef3b2fe75ea487c83313c36d45 upstream.
    
    There was an error on the jsm driver that would cause it to be unable to
    recover after a second error is detected.
    
    At the first error, the device recovers properly:
    
    [72521.485691] EEH: Detected PCI bus error on device 0003:02:00.0
    [72521.485695] EEH: This PCI device has failed 1 times in the last hour:
    ...
    [72532.035693] ttyn3 at MMIO 0x0 (irq = 49) is a jsm
    [72532.105689] jsm: Port 3 added
    
    However, at the second error, it cascades until EEH disables the device:
    
    [72631.229549] Call Trace:
    ...
    [72641.725687] jsm: Port 3 added

    [72641.725698] EEH: This PCI device has failed 3 times in the last hour:
    
    It was caused because the PCI state was not being saved after the first
    restore. Therefore, at the second recovery the PCI state would not be
    restored.

    TTY: fix UV serial console regression
    
    commit 0eee50af5b13e00b3fb7a5fe8480419a71b8235d upstream.
    
    Commit 74c2107759d (serial: Use block_til_ready helper) and its fixup
    3f582b8c110 (serial: fix termios settings in open) introduced a
    regression on UV systems. The serial eventually freezes while being
    used. It's completely unpredictable and sometimes needs a heap of
    traffic to happen first.
    
    To reproduce this, yast installation was used as it turned out to be
    pretty reliable in reproducing. Especially during installation process
    where one doesn't have an SSH daemon running. And no monitor as the HW
    is completely headless. So this was fun to find. Given the machine
    doesn't boot on vanilla before 2.6.36 final. (And the commits above
    are older.)
    
    Unless there is some bad race in the code, the hardware seems to be
    pretty broken. Otherwise pure MSR read should not cause such a bug,
    or?
    
    So to prevent the bug, revert to the old behavior. I.e. read modem
    status only if we really have to -- for non-CLOCAL set serials.
    Non-CLOCAL works on this hardware OK, I tried. See? I don't.
    
    And document that shit.

    USB: ftdi_sio: fix TIOCSSERIAL baud_base handling
    
    commit eb833a9e0972f60beb4ab8104ad7ef6bf30f02fc upstream.
    
    Return EINVAL if new baud_base does not match the current one.
    
    The baud_base is device specific and can not be changed. This restores
    the old (pre-2005) behaviour which was changed due to a
    misunderstanding regarding this fact (see
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/20/84).

    ARM: 7296/1: proc-v7.S: remove HARVARD_CACHE preprocessor guards
    
    commit 612539e81f655f6ac73c7af1da8701c1ee618aee upstream.
    
    On v7, we use the same cache maintenance instructions for data lines
    as for unified lines. This was not the case for v6, where HARVARD_CACHE
    was defined to indicate the L1 cache topology.
    
    This patch removes the erroneous compile-time check for HARVARD_CACHE in
    proc-v7.S, ensuring that we perform I-side invalidation at boot.

    cap_syslog: don't use WARN_ONCE for CAP_SYS_ADMIN deprecation warning
    
    commit f2c0d0266cc5eb36a4aa44944b4096ec121490aa upstream.
    
    syslog-ng versions before 3.3.0beta1 (2011-05-12) assume that
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN is sufficient to access syslog, so ever since CAP_SYSLOG
    was introduced (2010-11-25) they have triggered a warning.
    
    Commit ee24aebffb75 ("cap_syslog: accept CAP_SYS_ADMIN for now")
    improved matters a little by making syslog-ng work again, just keeping
    the WARN_ONCE().  But still, this is a warning that writes a stack trace
    we don't care about to syslog, sets a taint flag, and alarms sysadmins
    when nothing worse has happened than use of an old userspace with a
    recent kernel.
    
    Convert the WARN_ONCE to a printk_once to avoid that while continuing to
    give userspace developers a hint that this is an unwanted
    backward-compatibility feature and won't be around forever.

    x86/microcode_amd: Add support for CPU family specific container files
    
    commit 5b68edc91cdc972c46f76f85eded7ffddc3ff5c2 upstream.
    
    We've decided to provide CPU family specific container files
    (starting with CPU family 15h). E.g. for family 15h we have to
    load microcode_amd_fam15h.bin instead of microcode_amd.bin
    
    Rationale is that starting with family 15h patch size is larger
    than 2KB which was hard coded as maximum patch size in various
    microcode loaders (not just Linux).
    
    Container files which include patches larger than 2KB cause
    different kinds of trouble with such old patch loaders. Thus we
    have to ensure that the default container file provides only
    patches with size less than 2KB.

    xfs: fix endian conversion issue in discard code
    
    commit b1c770c273a4787069306fc82aab245e9ac72e9d upstream
    
    When finding the longest extent in an AG, we read the value directly
    out of the AGF buffer without endian conversion. This will give an
    incorrect length, resulting in FITRIM operations potentially not

    Note, for 3.0-stable this has been modified to apply to
    fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_discard.c instead of fs/xfs/xfs_discard.c.  -bpm

    When the ahash driver returns -EBUSY, AH4/6 input functions return
    NET_XMIT_DROP, presumably copied from the output code path.  But
    returning transmit codes on input doesn't make a lot of sense.
    Since NET_XMIT_DROP is a positive int, this gets interpreted as
    the next header type (i.e., success).  As that can only end badly,
    remove the check.

    ftrace: Fix unregister ftrace_ops accounting
    
    commit 30fb6aa74011dcf595f306ca2727254d708b786e upstream.
    
    Multiple users of the function tracer can register their functions
    with the ftrace_ops structure. The accounting within ftrace will
    update the counter on each function record that is being traced.
    When the ftrace_ops filtering adds or removes functions, the
    function records will be updated accordingly if the ftrace_ops is
    still registered.
    
    When a ftrace_ops is removed, the counter of the function records,
    that the ftrace_ops traces, are decremented. When they reach zero
    the functions that they represent are modified to stop calling the
    mcount code.
    
    When changes are made, the code is updated via stop_machine() with
    a command passed to the function to tell it what to do. There is an
    ENABLE and DISABLE command that tells the called function to enable
    or disable the functions. But the ENABLE is really a misnomer as it
    should just update the records, as records that have been enabled
    and now have a count of zero should be disabled.
    
    The DISABLE command is used to disable all functions regardless of
    their counter values. This is the big off switch and is not the
    complement of the ENABLE command.
    
    To make matters worse, when a ftrace_ops is unregistered and there
    is another ftrace_ops registered, neither the DISABLE nor the
    ENABLE command are set when calling into the stop_machine() function
    and the records will not be updated to match their counter. A command
    is passed to that function that will update the mcount code to call
    the registered callback directly if it is the only one left. This
    means that the ftrace_ops that is still registered will have its callback
    called by all functions that have been set for it as well as the ftrace_ops
    that was just unregistered.
    
    Here's a way to trigger this bug. Compile the kernel with
    CONFIG_FUNCTION_PROFILER set and with CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH not set:
    
     CONFIG_FUNCTION_PROFILER=y
     # CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH is not set
    
    This will force the function profiler to use the function tracer instead
    of the function graph tracer.

    The same problem could have happened with the trace_probe_ops,
    but they are modified with the set_frace_filter file which does the
    update at closure of the file.
    
    The simple solution is to change ENABLE to UPDATE and call it every
    time an ftrace_ops is unregistered.

    ftrace: Balance records when updating the hash
    
    commit 41fb61c2d08107ce96a5dcb3a6289b2afd3e135c upstream.
    
    Whenever the hash of the ftrace_ops is updated, the record counts
    must be balance. This requires disabling the records that are set
    in the original hash, and then enabling the records that are set
    in the updated hash.
    
    Moving the update into ftrace_hash_move() removes the bug where the
    hash was updated but the records were not, which results in ftrace
    triggering a warning and disabling itself because the ftrace_ops filter
    is updated while the ftrace_ops was registered, and then the failure
    happens when the ftrace_ops is unregistered.
    
    The current code will not trigger this bug, but new code will.

    crypto: sha512 - reduce stack usage to safe number
    
    commit 51fc6dc8f948047364f7d42a4ed89b416c6cc0a3 upstream.
    
    For rounds 16--79, W[i] only depends on W[i - 2], W[i - 7], W[i - 15] and W[i - 16].
    Consequently, keeping all W[80] array on stack is unnecessary,
    only 16 values are really needed.
    
    Using W[16] instead of W[80] greatly reduces stack usage
    (~750 bytes to ~340 bytes on x86_64).

      array is "circular" now, all indexes have to be modulo 16.
      Round number is positive, so remainder operation should be
      without surprises.
    
    * initial full message scheduling is trimmed to first 16 values which
      come from data block, the rest is calculated before it's needed.
    
    * original loop body is unrolled version of new SHA512_0_15 and
      SHA512_16_79 macros, unrolling was done to not do explicit variable
      renaming. Otherwise it's the very same code after preprocessing.
      See sha1_transform() code which does the same trick.
    
    Patch survives in-tree crypto test and original bugreport test
    (ping flood with hmac(sha512).

    crypto: sha512 - make it work, undo percpu message schedule
    
    commit 84e31fdb7c797a7303e0cc295cb9bc8b73fb872d upstream.
    
    commit f9e2bca6c22d75a289a349f869701214d63b5060
    aka "crypto: sha512 - Move message schedule W[80] to static percpu area"
    created global message schedule area.
    
    If sha512_update will ever be entered twice, hash will be silently
    calculated incorrectly.
    
    Probably the easiest way to notice incorrect hashes being calculated is
    to run 2 ping floods over AH with hmac(sha512):
    
            #!/usr/sbin/setkey -f
            flush;
            spdflush;
            add IP1 IP2 ah 25 -A hmac-sha512 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000025;
            add IP2 IP1 ah 52 -A hmac-sha512 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000052;
            spdadd IP1 IP2 any -P out ipsec ah/transport//require;
            spdadd IP2 IP1 any -P in  ipsec ah/transport//require;
    
    XfrmInStateProtoError will start ticking with -EBADMSG being returned
    from ah_input(). This never happens with, say, hmac(sha1).
    
    With patch applied (on BOTH sides), XfrmInStateProtoError does not tick
    with multiple bidirectional ping flood streams like it doesn't tick
    with SHA-1.
    
    After this patch sha512_transform() will start using ~750 bytes of stack on x86_64.
    This is OK for simple loads, for something more heavy, stack reduction will be done
    separatedly.

    drm: Fix authentication kernel crash
    
    commit 598781d71119827b454fd75d46f84755bca6f0c6 upstream.
    
    If the master tries to authenticate a client using drm_authmagic and
    that client has already closed its drm file descriptor,
    either wilfully or because it was terminated, the
    call to drm_authmagic will dereference a stale pointer into kmalloc'ed memory
    and corrupt it.
    
    Typically this results in a hard system hang.
    
    This patch fixes that problem by removing any authentication tokens
    (struct drm_magic_entry) open for a file descriptor when that file
    descriptor is closed.

    eCryptfs: Fix oops when printing debug info in extent crypto functions
    
    commit 58ded24f0fcb85bddb665baba75892f6ad0f4b8a upstream.
    
    If pages passed to the eCryptfs extent-based crypto functions are not
    mapped and the module parameter ecryptfs_verbosity=1 was specified at
    loading time, a NULL pointer dereference will occur.
    
    Note that this wouldn't happen on a production system, as you wouldn't
    pass ecryptfs_verbosity=1 on a production system. It leaks private
    information to the system logs and is for debugging only.
    
    The debugging info printed in these messages is no longer very useful
    and rather than doing a kmap() in these debugging paths, it will be
    better to simply remove the debugging paths completely.

    eCryptfs: Check inode changes in setattr
    
    commit a261a03904849c3df50bd0300efb7fb3f865137d upstream.
    
    Most filesystems call inode_change_ok() very early in ->setattr(), but
    eCryptfs didn't call it at all. It allowed the lower filesystem to make
    the call in its ->setattr() function. Then, eCryptfs would copy the
    appropriate inode attributes from the lower inode to the eCryptfs inode.
    
    This patch changes that and actually calls inode_change_ok() on the
    eCryptfs inode, fairly early in ecryptfs_setattr(). Ideally, the call
    would happen earlier in ecryptfs_setattr(), but there are some possible
    inode initialization steps that must happen first.
    
    Since the call was already being made on the lower inode, the change in
    functionality should be minimal, except for the case of a file extending
    truncate call. In that case, inode_newsize_ok() was never being
    called on the eCryptfs inode. Rather than inode_newsize_ok() catching
    maximum file size errors early on, eCryptfs would encrypt zeroed pages
    and write them to the lower filesystem until the lower filesystem's
    write path caught the error in generic_write_checks(). This patch
    introduces a new function, called ecryptfs_inode_newsize_ok(), which
    checks if the new lower file size is within the appropriate limits when
    the truncate operation will be growing the lower file.
    
    In summary this change prevents eCryptfs truncate operations (and the
    resulting page encryptions), which would exceed the lower filesystem
    limits or FSIZE rlimits, from ever starting.

    eCryptfs: Make truncate path killable
    
    commit 5e6f0d769017cc49207ef56996e42363ec26c1f0 upstream.
    
    ecryptfs_write() handles the truncation of eCryptfs inodes. It grabs a
    page, zeroes out the appropriate portions, and then encrypts the page
    before writing it to the lower filesystem. It was unkillable and due to
    the lack of sparse file support could result in tying up a large portion
    of system resources, while encrypting pages of zeros, with no way for
    the truncate operation to be stopped from userspace.
    
    This patch adds the ability for ecryptfs_write() to detect a pending
    fatal signal and return as gracefully as possible. The intent is to
    leave the lower file in a useable state, while still allowing a user to
    break out of the encryption loop. If a pending fatal signal is detected,
    the eCryptfs inode size is updated to reflect the modified inode size
    and then -EINTR is returned.

    eCryptfs: Sanitize write counts of /dev/ecryptfs
    
    commit db10e556518eb9d21ee92ff944530d84349684f4 upstream.
    
    A malicious count value specified when writing to /dev/ecryptfs may

    This patch peeks at the specified packet payload size, adds that to the
    size of the packet headers and compares the result with the write count
    value. The resulting maximum memory allocation size is approximately 532

    ALSA: hda - Fix silent outputs from docking-station jacks of Dell laptops
    
    commit b4ead019afc201f71c39cd0dfcaafed4a97b3dd2 upstream.
    
    The recent change of the power-widget handling for IDT codecs caused
    the silent output from the docking-station line-out jack.  This was
    partially fixed by the commit f2cbba7602383cd9cdd21f0a5d0b8bd1aad47b33
    "ALSA: hda - Fix the lost power-setup of seconary pins after PM resume".
    But the line-out on the docking-station is still silent when booted
    with the jack plugged even by this fix.
    
    The remainig bug is that the power-widget is set off in stac92xx_init()
    because the pins in cfg->line_out_pins[] aren't checked there properly
    but only hp_pins[] are checked in is_nid_hp_pin().
    
    This patch fixes the problem by checking both HP and line-out pins
    and leaving the power-map correctly.
