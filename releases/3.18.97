    ASN.1: fix out-of-bounds read when parsing indefinite length item
    
    commit e0058f3a874ebb48b25be7ff79bc3b4e59929f90 upstream.
    
    In asn1_ber_decoder(), indefinitely-sized ASN.1 items were being passed
    to the action functions before their lengths had been computed, using
    the bogus length of 0x80 (ASN1_INDEFINITE_LENGTH).  This resulted in
    reading data past the end of the input buffer, when given a specially
    crafted message.
    
    Fix it by rearranging the code so that the indefinite length is resolved
    before the action is called.
    
    This bug was originally found by fuzzing the X.509 parser in userspace
    using libFuzzer from the LLVM project.

    usb: gadget: f_fs: Process all descriptors during bind
    
    commit 6cf439e0d37463e42784271179c8a308fd7493c6 upstream.
    
    During _ffs_func_bind(), the received descriptors are evaluated
    to prepare for binding with the gadget in order to allocate
    endpoints and optionally set up OS descriptors. However, the
    high- and super-speed descriptors are only parsed based on
    whether the gadget_is_dualspeed() and gadget_is_superspeed()
    calls are true, respectively.
    
    This is a problem in case a userspace program always provides
    all of the {full,high,super,OS} descriptors when configuring a
    function. Then, for example if a gadget device is not capable
    of SuperSpeed, the call to ffs_do_descs() for the SS descriptors
    is skipped, resulting in an incorrect offset calculation for
    the vla_ptr when moving on to the OS descriptors that follow.
    This causes ffs_do_os_descs() to fail as it is now looking at
    the SS descriptors' offset within the raw_descs buffer instead.
    
    _ffs_func_bind() should evaluate the descriptors unconditionally,
    so remove the checks for gadget speed.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Set maxpacket size for ep0 IN
    
    commit 6180026341e852a250e1f97ebdcf71684a3c81b9 upstream.
    
    There are 2 control endpoint structures for DWC3. However, the driver
    only updates the OUT direction control endpoint structure during
    ConnectDone event. DWC3 driver needs to update the endpoint max packet
    size for control IN endpoint as well. If the max packet size is not
    properly set, then the driver will incorrectly calculate the data
    transfer size and fail to send ZLP for HS/FS 3-stage control read
    transfer.
    
    The fix is simply to update the max packet size for the ep0 IN direction
    during ConnectDone event.

    irqchip/gic-v3: Use wmb() instead of smb_wmb() in gic_raise_softirq()
    
    commit 21ec30c0ef5234fb1039cc7c7737d885bf875a9e upstream.
    
    A DMB instruction can be used to ensure the relative order of only
    memory accesses before and after the barrier. Since writes to system
    registers are not memory operations, barrier DMB is not sufficient
    for observability of memory accesses that occur before ICC_SGI1R_EL1
    writes.
    
    A DSB instruction ensures that no instructions that appear in program
    order after the DSB instruction, can execute until the DSB instruction
    has completed.

    x86/oprofile: Fix bogus GCC-8 warning in nmi_setup()
    
    commit 85c615eb52222bc5fab6c7190d146bc59fac289e upstream.
    
    GCC-8 shows a warning for the x86 oprofile code that copies per-CPU
    data from CPU 0 to all other CPUs, which when building a non-SMP
    kernel turns into a memcpy() with identical source and destination
    pointers:
    
     arch/x86/oprofile/nmi_int.c: In function 'mux_clone':
     arch/x86/oprofile/nmi_int.c:285:2: error: 'memcpy' source argument is the same as destination [-Werror=restrict]
       memcpy(per_cpu(cpu_msrs, cpu).multiplex,
       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              per_cpu(cpu_msrs, 0).multiplex,
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              sizeof(struct op_msr) * model->num_virt_counters);
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     arch/x86/oprofile/nmi_int.c: In function 'nmi_setup':
     arch/x86/oprofile/nmi_int.c:466:3: error: 'memcpy' source argument is the same as destination [-Werror=restrict]
     arch/x86/oprofile/nmi_int.c:470:3: error: 'memcpy' source argument is the same as destination [-Werror=restrict]
    
    I have analyzed a number of such warnings now: some are valid and the
    GCC warning is welcome. Others turned out to be false-positives, and
    GCC was changed to not warn about those any more. This is a corner case
    that is a false-positive but the GCC developers feel it's better to keep
    warning about it.
    
    In this case, it seems best to work around it by telling GCC
    a little more clearly that this code path is never hit with
    an IS_ENABLED() configuration check.

    iio: adis_lib: Initialize trigger before requesting interrupt
    
    commit f027e0b3a774e10302207e91d304bbf99e3a8b36 upstream.
    
    The adis_probe_trigger() creates a new IIO trigger and requests an
    interrupt associated with the trigger. The interrupt uses the generic
    iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll() function as its interrupt handler.
    
    Currently the driver initializes some fields of the trigger structure after
    the interrupt has been requested. But an interrupt can fire as soon as it
    has been requested. This opens up a race condition.
    
    iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll() will access the trigger data structure
    and dereference the ops field. If the ops field is not yet initialized this
    will result in a NULL pointer deref.
    
    It is not expected that the device generates an interrupt at this point, so
    typically this issue did not surface unless e.g. due to a hardware
    misconfiguration (wrong interrupt number, wrong polarity, etc.).
    
    But some newer devices from the ADIS family start to generate periodic
    interrupts in their power-on reset configuration and unfortunately the
    interrupt can not be masked in the device.  This makes the race condition
    much more visible and the following crash has been observed occasionally
    when booting a system using the ADIS16460.

    scsi: ibmvfc: fix misdefined reserved field in ibmvfc_fcp_rsp_info
    
    commit c39813652700f3df552b6557530f1e5f782dbe2f upstream.
    
    The fcp_rsp_info structure as defined in the FC spec has an initial 3
    bytes reserved field. The ibmvfc driver mistakenly defined this field as
    4 bytes resulting in the rsp_code field being defined in what should be
    the start of the second reserved field and thus always being reported as
    zero by the driver.
    
    Ideally, we should wire ibmvfc up with libfc for the sake of code
    deduplication, and ease of maintaining standardized structures in a
    single place. However, for now simply fixup the definition in ibmvfc for
    backporting to distros on older kernels. Wiring up with libfc will be
    done in a followup patch.

    PCI: keystone: Fix interrupt-controller-node lookup
    
    commit eac56aa3bc8af3d9b9850345d0f2da9d83529134 upstream.
    
    Fix child-node lookup during initialisation which was using the wrong
    OF-helper and ended up searching the whole device tree depth-first
    starting at the parent rather than just matching on its children.
    
    To make things worse, the parent pci node could end up being prematurely
    freed as of_find_node_by_name() drops a reference to its first argument.
    Any matching child interrupt-controller node was also leaked.

    netfilter: drop outermost socket lock in getsockopt()
    
    commit 01ea306f2ac2baff98d472da719193e738759d93 upstream.
    
    The Syzbot reported a possible deadlock in the netfilter area caused by
    rtnl lock, xt lock and socket lock being acquired with a different order
    on different code paths, leading to the following backtrace:

    Since commit 3f34cfae1230 ("netfilter: on sockopt() acquire sock lock
    only in the required scope"), we already acquire the socket lock in
    the innermost scope, where needed. In such commit I forgot to remove
    the outer-most socket lock from the getsockopt() path, this commit
    addresses the issues dropping it now.
