    fanotify: merge duplicate events on parent and child
    
    [ Upstream commit f367a62a7cad2447d835a9f14fc63997a9137246 ]
    
    With inotify, when a watch is set on a directory and on its child, an
    event on the child is reported twice, once with wd of the parent watch
    and once with wd of the child watch without the filename.
    
    With fanotify, when a watch is set on a directory and on its child, an
    event on the child is reported twice, but it has the exact same
    information - either an open file descriptor of the child or an encoded
    fid of the child.
    
    The reason that the two identical events are not merged is because the
    object id used for merging events in the queue is the child inode in one
    event and parent inode in the other.
    
    For events with path or dentry data, use the victim inode instead of the
    watched inode as the object id for event merging, so that the event
    reported on parent will be merged with the event reported on the child.

    fsnotify: replace inode pointer with an object id

    The event inode field is used only for comparison in queue merges and
    cannot be dereferenced after handle_event(), because it does not hold a
    refcount on the inode.
    
    Replace it with an abstract id to do the same thing.

    mm, memcg: fix error return value of mem_cgroup_css_alloc()
    
    commit 11d6761218d19ca06ae5387f4e3692c4fa9e7493 upstream.
    
    When I run my memcg testcase which creates lots of memcgs, I found
    there're unexpected out of memory logs while there're still enough
    available free memory.  The error log is
    
      mkdir: cannot create directory 'foo.65533': Cannot allocate memory
    
    The reason is when we try to create more than MEM_CGROUP_ID_MAX memcgs,
    an -ENOMEM errno will be set by mem_cgroup_css_alloc(), but the right
    errno should be -ENOSPC "No space left on device", which is an
    appropriate errno for userspace's failed mkdir.
    
    As the errno really misled me, we should make it right.  After this
    patch, the error log will be
    
      mkdir: cannot create directory 'foo.65533': No space left on device

    scripts/decodecode: fix trapping instruction formatting
    
    commit e08df079b23e2e982df15aa340bfbaf50f297504 upstream.
    
    If the trapping instruction contains a ':', for a memory access through
    segment registers for example, the sed substitution will insert the '*'
    marker in the middle of the instruction instead of the line address:
    
            2b:   65 48 0f c7 0f          cmpxchg16b %gs:*(%rdi)          <-- trapping instruction
    
    I started to think I had forgotten some quirk of the assembly syntax
    before noticing that it was actually coming from the script.  Fix it to
    add the address marker at the right place for these instructions:
    
            28:   49 8b 06                mov    (%r14),%rax

    objtool: Fix stack offset tracking for indirect CFAs
    
    commit d8dd25a461e4eec7190cb9d66616aceacc5110ad upstream.
    
    When the current frame address (CFA) is stored on the stack (i.e.,
    cfa->base == CFI_SP_INDIRECT), objtool neglects to adjust the stack
    offset when there are subsequent pushes or pops.  This results in bad
    ORC data at the end of the ENTER_IRQ_STACK macro, when it puts the
    previous stack pointer on the stack and does a subsequent push.
    
    This fixes the following unwinder warning:

    netfilter: nat: never update the UDP checksum when it's 0
    
    commit ea64d8d6c675c0bb712689b13810301de9d8f77a upstream.
    
    If the UDP header of a local VXLAN endpoint is NAT-ed, and the VXLAN
    device has disabled UDP checksums and enabled Tx checksum offloading,
    then the skb passed to udp_manip_pkt() has hdr->check == 0 (outer
    checksum disabled) and skb->ip_summed == CHECKSUM_PARTIAL (inner packet
    checksum offloaded).
    
    Because of the ->ip_summed value, udp_manip_pkt() tries to update the
    outer checksum with the new address and port, leading to an invalid
    checksum sent on the wire, as the original null checksum obviously
    didn't take the old address and port into account.
    
    So, we can't take ->ip_summed into account in udp_manip_pkt(), as it
    might not refer to the checksum we're acting on. Instead, we can base
    the decision to update the UDP checksum entirely on the value of
    hdr->check, because it's null if and only if checksum is disabled:
    
      * A fully computed checksum can't be 0, since a 0 checksum is
        represented by the CSUM_MANGLED_0 value instead.
    
      * A partial checksum can't be 0, since the pseudo-header always adds
        at least one non-zero value (the UDP protocol type 0x11) and adding
        more values to the sum can't make it wrap to 0 as the carry is then
        added to the wrapped number.
    
      * A disabled checksum uses the special value 0.
    
    The problem seems to be there from day one, although it was probably
    not visible before UDP tunnels were implemented.

    x86/unwind/orc: Fix premature unwind stoppage due to IRET frames
    
    commit 81b67439d147677d844d492fcbd03712ea438f42 upstream.
    
    The following execution path is possible:
    
      fsnotify()
        [ realign the stack and store previous SP in R10 ]
        <IRQ>
          [ only IRET regs saved ]
          common_interrupt()
            interrupt_entry()
              <NMI>
                [ full pt_regs saved ]
                ...
                [ unwind stack ]
    
    When the unwinder goes through the NMI and the IRQ on the stack, and
    then sees fsnotify(), it doesn't have access to the value of R10,
    because it only has the five IRET registers.  So the unwind stops
    prematurely.
    
    However, because the interrupt_entry() code is careful not to clobber
    R10 before saving the full regs, the unwinder should be able to read R10
    from the previously saved full pt_regs associated with the NMI.
    
    Handle this case properly.  When encountering an IRET regs frame
    immediately after a full pt_regs frame, use the pt_regs as a backup
    which can be used to get the C register values.
    
    Also, note that a call frame resets the 'prev_regs' value, because a
    function is free to clobber the registers.  For this fix to work, the
    IRET and full regs frames must be adjacent, with no FUNC frames in
    between.  So replace the FUNC hint in interrupt_entry() with an
    IRET_REGS hint.

    x86/unwind/orc: Prevent unwinding before ORC initialization
    
    commit 98d0c8ebf77e0ba7c54a9ae05ea588f0e9e3f46e upstream.
    
    If the unwinder is called before the ORC data has been initialized,
    orc_find() returns NULL, and it tries to fall back to using frame
    pointers.  This can cause some unexpected warnings during boot.
    
    Move the 'orc_init' check from orc_find() to __unwind_init(), so that it
    doesn't even try to unwind from an uninitialized state.

    x86/unwind/orc: Don't skip the first frame for inactive tasks
    
    commit f1d9a2abff66aa8156fbc1493abed468db63ea48 upstream.
    
    When unwinding an inactive task, the ORC unwinder skips the first frame
    by default.  If both the 'regs' and 'first_frame' parameters of
    unwind_start() are NULL, 'state->sp' and 'first_frame' are later
    initialized to the same value for an inactive task.  Given there is a
    "less than or equal to" comparison used at the end of __unwind_start()
    for skipping stack frames, the first frame is skipped.
    
    Drop the equal part of the comparison and make the behavior equivalent
    to the frame pointer unwinder.

    x86/entry/64: Fix unwind hints in kernel exit path
    
    commit 1fb143634a38095b641a3a21220774799772dc4c upstream.
    
    In swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode, after the stack is
    switched to the trampoline stack, the existing UNWIND_HINT_REGS hint is
    no longer valid, which can result in the following ORC unwinder warning:
    
      WARNING: can't dereference registers at 000000003aeb0cdd for ip swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode+0x93/0xa0
    
    For full correctness, we could try to add complicated unwind hints so
    the unwinder could continue to find the registers, but when when it's
    this close to kernel exit, unwind hints aren't really needed anymore and
    it's fine to just use an empty hint which tells the unwinder to stop.
    
    For consistency, also move the UNWIND_HINT_EMPTY in
    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe to a similar location.

    x86/entry/64: Fix unwind hints in register clearing code
    
    commit 06a9750edcffa808494d56da939085c35904e618 upstream.
    
    The PUSH_AND_CLEAR_REGS macro zeroes each register immediately after
    pushing it.  If an NMI or exception hits after a register is cleared,
    but before the UNWIND_HINT_REGS annotation, the ORC unwinder will
    wrongly think the previous value of the register was zero.  This can
    confuse the unwinding process and cause it to exit early.
    
    Because ORC is simpler than DWARF, there are a limited number of unwind
    annotation states, so it's not possible to add an individual unwind hint
    after each push/clear combination.  Instead, the register clearing
    instructions need to be consolidated and moved to after the
    UNWIND_HINT_REGS annotation.

    batman-adv: Fix refcnt leak in batadv_v_ogm_process
    
    commit 6f91a3f7af4186099dd10fa530dd7e0d9c29747d upstream.
    
    batadv_v_ogm_process() invokes batadv_hardif_neigh_get(), which returns
    a reference of the neighbor object to "hardif_neigh" with increased
    refcount.
    
    When batadv_v_ogm_process() returns, "hardif_neigh" becomes invalid, so
    the refcount should be decreased to keep refcount balanced.
    
    The reference counting issue happens in one exception handling paths of
    batadv_v_ogm_process(). When batadv_v_ogm_orig_get() fails to get the
    orig node and returns NULL, the refcnt increased by
    batadv_hardif_neigh_get() is not decreased, causing a refcnt leak.
    
    Fix this issue by jumping to "out" label when batadv_v_ogm_orig_get()
    fails to get the orig node.

    batman-adv: fix batadv_nc_random_weight_tq
    
    commit fd0c42c4dea54335967c5a86f15fc064235a2797 upstream.
    
    and change to pseudorandom numbers, as this is a traffic dithering
    operation that doesn't need crypto-grade.
    
    The previous code operated in 4 steps:
    
    1. Generate a random byte 0 <= rand_tq <= 255
    2. Multiply it by BATADV_TQ_MAX_VALUE - tq
    3. Divide by 255 (= BATADV_TQ_MAX_VALUE)
    4. Return BATADV_TQ_MAX_VALUE - rand_tq
    
    This would apperar to scale (BATADV_TQ_MAX_VALUE - tq) by a random
    value between 0/255 and 255/255.
    
    But!  The intermediate value between steps 3 and 4 is stored in a u8
    variable.  So it's truncated, and most of the time, is less than 255, after
    which the division produces 0.  Specifically, if tq is odd, the product is
    always even, and can never be 255.  If tq is even, there's exactly one
    random byte value that will produce a product byte of 255.
    
    Thus, the return value is 255 (511/512 of the time) or 254 (1/512
    of the time).
    
    If we assume that the truncation is a bug, and the code is meant to scale
    the input, a simpler way of looking at it is that it's returning a random
    value between tq and BATADV_TQ_MAX_VALUE, inclusive.
    
    Well, we have an optimized function for doing just that.

    iocost: protect iocg->abs_vdebt with iocg->waitq.lock
    
    commit 0b80f9866e6bbfb905140ed8787ff2af03652c0c upstream.
    
    abs_vdebt is an atomic_64 which tracks how much over budget a given cgroup
    is and controls the activation of use_delay mechanism. Once a cgroup goes
    over budget from forced IOs, it has to pay it back with its future budget.
    The progress guarantee on debt paying comes from the iocg being active -
    active iocgs are processed by the periodic timer, which ensures that as time
    passes the debts dissipate and the iocg returns to normal operation.
    
    However, both iocg activation and vdebt handling are asynchronous and a
    sequence like the following may happen.
    
    1. The iocg is in the process of being deactivated by the periodic timer.
    
    2. A bio enters ioc_rqos_throttle(), calls iocg_activate() which returns
       without anything because it still sees that the iocg is already active.
    
    3. The iocg is deactivated.
    
    4. The bio from #2 is over budget but needs to be forced. It increases
       abs_vdebt and goes over the threshold and enables use_delay.
    
    5. IO control is enabled for the iocg's subtree and now IOs are attributed
       to the descendant cgroups and the iocg itself no longer issues IOs.
    
    This leaves the iocg with stuck abs_vdebt - it has debt but inactive and no
    further IOs which can activate it. This can end up unduly punishing all the
    descendants cgroups.
    
    The usual throttling path has the same issue - the iocg must be active while
    throttled to ensure that future event will wake it up - and solves the
    problem by synchronizing the throttling path with a spinlock. abs_vdebt
    handling is another form of overage handling and shares a lot of
    characteristics including the fact that it isn't in the hottest path.
    
    This patch fixes the above and other possible races by strictly
    synchronizing abs_vdebt and use_delay handling with iocg->waitq.lock.

    coredump: fix crash when umh is disabled
    
    commit 3740d93e37902b31159a82da2d5c8812ed825404 upstream.
    
    Commit 64e90a8acb859 ("Introduce STATIC_USERMODEHELPER to mediate
    call_usermodehelper()") added the optiont to disable all
    call_usermodehelper() calls by setting STATIC_USERMODEHELPER_PATH to
    an empty string. When this is done, and crashdump is triggered, it
    will crash on null pointer dereference, since we make assumptions
    over what call_usermodehelper_exec() did.
    
    This has been reported by Sergey when one triggers a a coredump
    with the following configuration:
    
    ```
    CONFIG_STATIC_USERMODEHELPER=y
    CONFIG_STATIC_USERMODEHELPER_PATH=""
    kernel.core_pattern = |/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-coredump %P %u %g %s %t %c %h %e
    ```
    
    The way disabling the umh was designed was that call_usermodehelper_exec()
    would just return early, without an error. But coredump assumes
    certain variables are set up for us when this happens, and calls
    ile_start_write(cprm.file) with a NULL file.

    mm: limit boost_watermark on small zones
    
    commit 14f69140ff9c92a0928547ceefb153a842e8492c upstream.
    
    Commit 1c30844d2dfe ("mm: reclaim small amounts of memory when an
    external fragmentation event occurs") adds a boost_watermark() function
    which increases the min watermark in a zone by at least
    pageblock_nr_pages or the number of pages in a page block.
    
    On Arm64, with 64K pages and 512M huge pages, this is 8192 pages or
    512M.  It does this regardless of the number of managed pages managed in
    the zone or the likelihood of success.
    
    This can put the zone immediately under water in terms of allocating
    pages from the zone, and can cause a small machine to fail immediately
    due to OoM.  Unlike set_recommended_min_free_kbytes(), which
    substantially increases min_free_kbytes and is tied to THP,
    boost_watermark() can be called even if THP is not active.
    
    The problem is most likely to appear on architectures such as Arm64
    where pageblock_nr_pages is very large.
    
    It is desirable to run the kdump capture kernel in as small a space as
    possible to avoid wasting memory.  In some architectures, such as Arm64,
    there are restrictions on where the capture kernel can run, and
    therefore, the space available.  A capture kernel running in 768M can
    fail due to OoM immediately after boost_watermark() sets the min in zone
    DMA32, where most of the memory is, to 512M.  It fails even though there
    is over 500M of free memory.  With boost_watermark() suppressed, the
    capture kernel can run successfully in 448M.
    
    This patch limits boost_watermark() to boosting a zone's min watermark
    only when there are enough pages that the boost will produce positive
    results.  In this case that is estimated to be four times as many pages
    as pageblock_nr_pages.

    mm/page_alloc: fix watchdog soft lockups during set_zone_contiguous()

    eventpoll: fix missing wakeup for ovflist in ep_poll_callback
    
    commit 0c54a6a44bf3d41e76ce3f583a6ece267618df2e upstream.
    
    In the event that we add to ovflist, before commit 339ddb53d373
    ("fs/epoll: remove unnecessary wakeups of nested epoll") we would be
    woken up by ep_scan_ready_list, and did no wakeup in ep_poll_callback.
    
    With that wakeup removed, if we add to ovflist here, we may never wake
    up.  Rather than adding back the ep_scan_ready_list wakeup - which was
    resulting in unnecessary wakeups, trigger a wake-up in ep_poll_callback.
    
    We noticed that one of our workloads was missing wakeups starting with
    339ddb53d373 and upon manual inspection, this wakeup seemed missing to me.
    With this patch added, we no longer see missing wakeups.  I haven't yet
    tried to make a small reproducer, but the existing kselftests in
    filesystem/epoll passed for me with this patch.

    epoll: atomically remove wait entry on wake up
    
    commit 412895f03cbf9633298111cb4dfde13b7720e2c5 upstream.
    
    This patch does two things:
    
     - fixes a lost wakeup introduced by commit 339ddb53d373 ("fs/epoll:
       remove unnecessary wakeups of nested epoll")
    
     - improves performance for events delivery.
    
    The description of the problem is the following: if N (>1) threads are
    waiting on ep->wq for new events and M (>1) events come, it is quite
    likely that >1 wakeups hit the same wait queue entry, because there is
    quite a big window between __add_wait_queue_exclusive() and the
    following __remove_wait_queue() calls in ep_poll() function.
    
    This can lead to lost wakeups, because thread, which was woken up, can
    handle not all the events in ->rdllist.  (in better words the problem is
    described here: https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/10/7/905)
    
    The idea of the current patch is to use init_wait() instead of
    init_waitqueue_entry().
    
    Internally init_wait() sets autoremove_wake_function as a callback,
    which removes the wait entry atomically (under the wq locks) from the
    list, thus the next coming wakeup hits the next wait entry in the wait
    queue, thus preventing lost wakeups.
    
    Problem is very well reproduced by the epoll60 test case [1].
    
    Wait entry removal on wakeup has also performance benefits, because
    there is no need to take a ep->lock and remove wait entry from the queue
    after the successful wakeup.  Here is the timing output of the epoll60
    test case:
    
      With explicit wakeup from ep_scan_ready_list() (the state of the
      code prior 339ddb53d373):
    
        real    0m6.970s
        user    0m49.786s
        sys     0m0.113s

    ipc/mqueue.c: change __do_notify() to bypass check_kill_permission()
    
    commit b5f2006144c6ae941726037120fa1001ddede784 upstream.
    
    Commit cc731525f26a ("signal: Remove kernel interal si_code magic")
    changed the value of SI_FROMUSER(SI_MESGQ), this means that mq_notify() no
    longer works if the sender doesn't have rights to send a signal.
    
    Change __do_notify() to use do_send_sig_info() instead of kill_pid_info()
    to avoid check_kill_permission().
    
    This needs the additional notify.sigev_signo != 0 check, shouldn't we
    change do_mq_notify() to deny sigev_signo == 0 ?
    
    Test-case:
    
            #include <signal.h>
            #include <mqueue.h>
            #include <unistd.h>
            #include <sys/wait.h>
            #include <assert.h>
    
            static int notified;
    
            static void sigh(int sig)
            {
                    notified = 1;
            }
    
            int main(void)
            {
                    signal(SIGIO, sigh);
    
                    int fd = mq_open("/mq", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0666, NULL);
                    assert(fd >= 0);
    
                    struct sigevent se = {
                            .sigev_notify   = SIGEV_SIGNAL,
                            .sigev_signo    = SIGIO,
                    };
                    assert(mq_notify(fd, &se) == 0);
    
                    if (!fork()) {
                            assert(setuid(1) == 0);
                            mq_send(fd, "",1,0);
                            return 0;

                    return 0;
            }

    arm64: hugetlb: avoid potential NULL dereference
    
    commit 027d0c7101f50cf03aeea9eebf484afd4920c8d3 upstream.
    
    The static analyzer in GCC 10 spotted that in huge_pte_alloc() we may
    pass a NULL pmdp into pte_alloc_map() when pmd_alloc() returns NULL:
    
    |   CC      arch/arm64/mm/pageattr.o
    |   CC      arch/arm64/mm/hugetlbpage.o
    |                  from arch/arm64/mm/hugetlbpage.c:10:
    | arch/arm64/mm/hugetlbpage.c: In function ‘huge_pte_alloc’:
    | ./arch/arm64/include/asm/pgtable-types.h:28:24: warning: dereference of NULL ‘pmdp’ [CWE-690] [-Wanalyzer-null-dereference]
    | ./arch/arm64/include/asm/pgtable.h:436:26: note: in expansion of macro ‘pmd_val’
    | arch/arm64/mm/hugetlbpage.c:242:10: note: in expansion of macro ‘pte_alloc_map’
    |     |arch/arm64/mm/hugetlbpage.c:232:10:
    |     |./arch/arm64/include/asm/pgtable-types.h:28:24:

    | arch/arm64/mm/hugetlbpage.c:242:10: note: in expansion of macro ‘pte_alloc_map’
    
    This can only occur when the kernel cannot allocate a page, and so is
    unlikely to happen in practice before other systems start failing.
    
    We can avoid this by bailing out if pmd_alloc() fails, as we do earlier
    in the function if pud_alloc() fails.

    KVM: arm64: Fix 32bit PC wrap-around
    
    commit 0225fd5e0a6a32af7af0aefac45c8ebf19dc5183 upstream.
    
    In the unlikely event that a 32bit vcpu traps into the hypervisor
    on an instruction that is located right at the end of the 32bit
    range, the emulation of that instruction is going to increment
    PC past the 32bit range. This isn't great, as userspace can then
    observe this value and get a bit confused.
    
    Conversly, userspace can do things like (in the context of a 64bit
    guest that is capable of 32bit EL0) setting PSTATE to AArch64-EL0,
    set PC to a 64bit value, change PSTATE to AArch32-USR, and observe
    that PC hasn't been truncated. More confusion.
    
    Fix both by:
    - truncating PC increments for 32bit guests
    - sanitizing all 32bit regs every time a core reg is changed by
      userspace, and that PSTATE indicates a 32bit mode.

    KVM: VMX: Explicitly clear RFLAGS.CF and RFLAGS.ZF in VM-Exit RSB path
    
    commit c7cb2d650c9e78c03bd2d1c0db89891825f8c0f4 upstream.
    
    Clear CF and ZF in the VM-Exit path after doing __FILL_RETURN_BUFFER so
    that KVM doesn't interpret clobbered RFLAGS as a VM-Fail.  Filling the
    RSB has always clobbered RFLAGS, its current incarnation just happens
    clear CF and ZF in the processs.  Relying on the macro to clear CF and
    ZF is extremely fragile, e.g. commit 089dd8e53126e ("x86/speculation:
    Change FILL_RETURN_BUFFER to work with objtool") tweaks the loop such
    that the ZF flag is always set.

    commit 5615e74f48dcc982655543e979b6c3f3f877e6f6 upstream.
    
    In LPAR we will only get an intercept for FC==3 for the PQAP
    instruction. Running nested under z/VM can result in other intercepts as
    well as ECA_APIE is an effective bit: If one hypervisor layer has
    turned this bit off, the end result will be that we will get intercepts for
    all function codes. Usually the first one will be a query like PQAP(QCI).
    So the WARN_ON_ONCE is not right. Let us simply remove it.

    tracing: Add a vmalloc_sync_mappings() for safe measure
    
    commit 11f5efc3ab66284f7aaacc926e9351d658e2577b upstream.
    
    x86_64 lazily maps in the vmalloc pages, and the way this works with per_cpu
    areas can be complex, to say the least. Mappings may happen at boot up, and
    if nothing synchronizes the page tables, those page mappings may not be
    synced till they are used. This causes issues for anything that might touch
    one of those mappings in the path of the page fault handler. When one of
    those unmapped mappings is touched in the page fault handler, it will cause
    another page fault, which in turn will cause a page fault, and leave us in
    a loop of page faults.
    
    Commit 763802b53a42 ("x86/mm: split vmalloc_sync_all()") split
    vmalloc_sync_all() into vmalloc_sync_unmappings() and
    vmalloc_sync_mappings(), as on system exit, it did not need to do a full
    sync on x86_64 (although it still needed to be done on x86_32). By chance,
    the vmalloc_sync_all() would synchronize the page mappings done at boot up
    and prevent the per cpu area from being a problem for tracing in the page
    fault handler. But when that synchronization in the exit of a task became a
    nop, it caused the problem to appear.

    commit 91edf63d5022bd0464788ffb4acc3d5febbaf81d upstream.
    
    Currently we check to make sure there is no error state on the extcon
    handle for VBUS when writing to the HS_PHY_GENCONFIG_2 register. When using
    the USB role-switch API we still need to write to this register absent an
    extcon handle.
    
    This patch makes the appropriate update to ensure the write happens if
    role-switching is true.

    HID: wacom: Report 2nd-gen Intuos Pro S center button status over BT
    
    commit dcce8ef8f70a8e38e6c47c1bae8b312376c04420 upstream.
    
    The state of the center button was not reported to userspace for the
    2nd-gen Intuos Pro S when used over Bluetooth due to the pad handling
    code not being updated to support its reduced number of buttons. This
    patch uses the actual number of buttons present on the tablet to
    assemble a button state bitmap.

    HID: usbhid: Fix race between usbhid_close() and usbhid_stop()
    
    commit 0ed08faded1da03eb3def61502b27f81aef2e615 upstream.
    
    The syzbot fuzzer discovered a bad race between in the usbhid driver
    between usbhid_stop() and usbhid_close().  In particular,
    usbhid_stop() does:
    
            usb_free_urb(usbhid->urbin);
            ...
            usbhid->urbin = NULL; /* don't mess up next start */
    
    and usbhid_close() does:
    
            usb_kill_urb(usbhid->urbin);
    
    with no mutual exclusion.  If the two routines happen to run
    concurrently so that usb_kill_urb() is called in between the
    usb_free_urb() and the NULL assignment, it will access the
    deallocated urb structure -- a use-after-free bug.
    
    This patch adds a mutex to the usbhid private structure and uses it to
    enforce mutual exclusion of the usbhid_start(), usbhid_stop(),
    usbhid_open() and usbhid_close() callbacks.

    Revert "HID: wacom: generic: read the number of expected touches on a per collection basis"
    
    commit b43f977dd281945960c26b3ef67bba0fa07d39d9 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 15893fa40109f5e7c67eeb8da62267d0fdf0be9d.
    
    The referenced commit broke pen and touch input for a variety of devices
    such as the Cintiq Pro 32. Affected devices may appear to work normally
    for a short amount of time, but eventually loose track of actual touch
    state and can leave touch arbitration enabled which prevents the pen
    from working. The commit is not itself required for any currently-available
    Bluetooth device, and so we revert it to correct the behavior of broken
    devices.
    
    This breakage occurs due to a mismatch between the order of collections
    and the order of usages on some devices. This commit tries to read the
    contact count before processing events, but will fail if the contact
    count does not occur prior to the first logical finger collection. This
    is the case for devices like the Cintiq Pro 32 which place the contact
    count at the very end of the report.
    
    Without the contact count set, touches will only be partially processed.
    The `wacom_wac_finger_slot` function will not open any slots since the
    number of contacts seen is greater than the expectation of 0, but we will
    still end up calling `input_mt_sync_frame` for each finger anyway. This
    can cause problems for userspace separate from the issue currently taking
    place in the kernel. Only once all of the individual finger collections
    have been processed do we finally get to the enclosing collection which
    contains the contact count. The value ends up being used for the *next*
    report, however.
    
    This delayed use of the contact count can cause the driver to loose track
    of the actual touch state and believe that there are contacts down when
    there aren't. This leaves touch arbitration enabled and prevents the pen
    from working. It can also cause userspace to incorrectly treat single-
    finger input as gestures.

    sctp: Fix bundling of SHUTDOWN with COOKIE-ACK
    
    commit 145cb2f7177d94bc54563ed26027e952ee0ae03c upstream.
    
    When we start shutdown in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a(), we want to bundle
    the SHUTDOWN with the COOKIE-ACK to ensure that the peer receives them
    at the same time and in the correct order. This bundling was broken by
    commit 4ff40b86262b ("sctp: set chunk transport correctly when it's a
    new asoc"), which assigns a transport for the COOKIE-ACK, but not for
    the SHUTDOWN.
    
    Fix this by passing a reference to the COOKIE-ACK chunk as an argument
    to sctp_sf_do_9_2_start_shutdown() and onward to
    sctp_make_shutdown(). This way the SHUTDOWN chunk is assigned the same
    transport as the COOKIE-ACK chunk, which allows them to be bundled.
    
    In sctp_sf_do_9_2_start_shutdown(), the void *arg parameter was
    previously unused. Now that we're taking it into use, it must be a
    valid pointer to a chunk, or NULL. There is only one call site where
    it's not, in sctp_sf_autoclose_timer_expire(). Fix that too.

    HID: wacom: Read HID_DG_CONTACTMAX directly for non-generic devices
    
    commit 778fbf4179991e7652e97d7f1ca1f657ef828422 upstream.
    
    We've recently switched from extracting the value of HID_DG_CONTACTMAX
    at a fixed offset (which may not be correct for all tablets) to
    injecting the report into the driver for the generic codepath to handle.
    Unfortunately, this change was made for *all* tablets, even those which
    aren't generic. Because `wacom_wac_report` ignores reports from non-
    generic devices, the contact count never gets initialized. Ultimately
    this results in the touch device itself failing to probe, and thus the
    loss of touch input.
    
    This commit adds back the fixed-offset extraction for non-generic devices.

    tipc: fix partial topology connection closure
    
    [ Upstream commit 980d69276f3048af43a045be2925dacfb898a7be ]
    
    When an application connects to the TIPC topology server and subscribes
    to some services, a new connection is created along with some objects -
    'tipc_subscription' to store related data correspondingly...
    However, there is one omission in the connection handling that when the
    connection or application is orderly shutdown (e.g. via SIGQUIT, etc.),
    the connection is not closed in kernel, the 'tipc_subscription' objects

    This results in:
    - The maximum number of subscriptions (65535) will be reached soon, new

    - TIPC module cannot be removed (unless the objects  are somehow forced

    sch_sfq: validate silly quantum values
    
    [ Upstream commit df4953e4e997e273501339f607b77953772e3559 ]
    
    syzbot managed to set up sfq so that q->scaled_quantum was zero,
    triggering an infinite loop in sfq_dequeue()
    
    More generally, we must only accept quantum between 1 and 2^18 - 7,
    meaning scaled_quantum must be in [1, 0x7FFF] range.
    
    Otherwise, we also could have a loop in sfq_dequeue()
    if scaled_quantum happens to be 0x8000, since slot->allot
    could indefinitely switch between 0 and 0x8000.

    net/tls: Fix sk_psock refcnt leak when in tls_data_ready()
    
    [ Upstream commit 62b4011fa7bef9fa00a6aeec26e69685dc1cc21e ]
    
    tls_data_ready() invokes sk_psock_get(), which returns a reference of
    the specified sk_psock object to "psock" with increased refcnt.
    
    When tls_data_ready() returns, local variable "psock" becomes invalid,
    so the refcount should be decreased to keep refcount balanced.
    
    The reference counting issue happens in one exception handling path of
    tls_data_ready(). When "psock->ingress_msg" is empty but "psock" is not
    NULL, the function forgets to decrease the refcnt increased by
    sk_psock_get(), causing a refcnt leak.
    
    Fix this issue by calling sk_psock_put() on all paths when "psock" is
    not NULL.

    net: macsec: preserve ingress frame ordering
    
    [ Upstream commit ab046a5d4be4c90a3952a0eae75617b49c0cb01b ]
    
    MACsec decryption always occurs in a softirq context. Since
    the FPU may not be usable in the softirq context, the call to
    decrypt may be scheduled on the cryptd work queue. The cryptd
    work queue does not provide ordering guarantees. Therefore,
    preserving order requires masking out ASYNC implementations
    of gcm(aes).
    
    For instance, an Intel CPU with AES-NI makes available the
    generic-gcm-aesni driver from the aesni_intel module to
    implement gcm(aes). However, this implementation requires
    the FPU, so it is not always available to use from a softirq
    context, and will fallback to the cryptd work queue, which
    does not preserve frame ordering. With this change, such a
    system would select gcm_base(ctr(aes-aesni),ghash-generic).
    While the aes-aesni implementation prefers to use the FPU, it
    will fallback to the aes-asm implementation if unavailable.
    
    By using a synchronous version of gcm(aes), the decryption
    will complete before returning from crypto_aead_decrypt().
    Therefore, the macsec_decrypt_done() callback will be called
    before returning from macsec_decrypt(). Thus, the order of
    calls to macsec_post_decrypt() for the frames is preserved.
    
    While it's presumable that the pure AES-NI version of gcm(aes)
    is more performant, the hybrid solution is capable of gigabit
    speeds on modest hardware. Regardless, preserving the order
    of frames is paramount for many network protocols (e.g.,
    triggering TCP retries). Within the MACsec driver itself, the
    replay protection is tripped by the out-of-order frames, and
    can cause frames to be dropped.
    
    This bug has been present in this code since it was added in
    v4.6, however it may not have been noticed since not all CPUs
    have FPU offload available. Additionally, the bug manifests
    as occasional out-of-order packets that are easily
    misattributed to other network phenomena.
    
    When this code was added in v4.6, the crypto/gcm.c code did
    not restrict selection of the ghash function based on the
    ASYNC flag. For instance, x86 CPUs with PCLMULQDQ would
    select the ghash-clmulni driver instead of ghash-generic,
    which submits to the cryptd work queue if the FPU is busy.
    However, this bug was was corrected in v4.8 by commit
    b30bdfa86431afbafe15284a3ad5ac19b49b88e3, and was backported
    all the way back to the v3.14 stable branch, so this patch
    should be applicable back to the v4.6 stable branch.

    [ Upstream commit 050569fc8384c8056bacefcc246bcb2dfe574936 ]
    
    When ndo_get_phys_port_name() for the CPU port was added we introduced
    an early check for when the DSA master network device in
    dsa_master_ndo_setup() already implements ndo_get_phys_port_name(). When
    we perform the teardown operation in dsa_master_ndo_teardown() we would
    not be checking that cpu_dp->orig_ndo_ops was successfully allocated and
    non-NULL initialized.
    
    With network device drivers such as virtio_net, this leads to a NPD as
    soon as the DSA switch hanging off of it gets torn down because we are
    now assigning the virtio_net device's netdev_ops a NULL pointer.

    ordering of vchunks in the vregion list. However, the current code
    always adds new chunk to the end of the list, no matter what the
    priority is. Fix this by finding the correct place in the list and put
    vchunk there.

    ipv6: Use global sernum for dst validation with nexthop objects
    
    [ Upstream commit 8f34e53b60b337e559f1ea19e2780ff95ab2fa65 ]
    
    Nik reported a bug with pcpu dst cache when nexthop objects are
    used illustrated by the following:
        $ ip netns add foo
        $ ip -netns foo li set lo up
        $ ip -netns foo addr add 2001:db8:11::1/128 dev lo
        $ ip netns exec foo sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
        $ ip li add veth1 type veth peer name veth2
        $ ip li set veth1 up
        $ ip addr add 2001:db8:10::1/64 dev veth1
        $ ip li set dev veth2 netns foo
        $ ip -netns foo li set veth2 up
        $ ip -netns foo addr add 2001:db8:10::2/64 dev veth2
        $ ip -6 nexthop add id 100 via 2001:db8:10::2 dev veth1
        $ ip -6 route add 2001:db8:11::1/128 nhid 100
    
        Create a pcpu entry on cpu 0:
        $ taskset -a -c 0 ip -6 route get 2001:db8:11::1
    
        Re-add the route entry:
        $ ip -6 ro del 2001:db8:11::1
        $ ip -6 route add 2001:db8:11::1/128 nhid 100
    
        Route get on cpu 0 returns the stale pcpu:
        $ taskset -a -c 0 ip -6 route get 2001:db8:11::1
        RTNETLINK answers: Network is unreachable
    
        While cpu 1 works:
        $ taskset -a -c 1 ip -6 route get 2001:db8:11::1
        2001:db8:11::1 from :: via 2001:db8:10::2 dev veth1 src 2001:db8:10::1 metric 1024 pref medium
    
    Conversion of FIB entries to work with external nexthop objects
    missed an important difference between IPv4 and IPv6 - how dst
    entries are invalidated when the FIB changes. IPv4 has a per-network
    namespace generation id (rt_genid) that is bumped on changes to the FIB.
    Checking if a dst_entry is still valid means comparing rt_genid in the
    rtable to the current value of rt_genid for the namespace.
    
    IPv6 also has a per network namespace counter, fib6_sernum, but the
    count is saved per fib6_node. With the per-node counter only dst_entries
    based on fib entries under the node are invalidated when changes are
    made to the routes - limiting the scope of invalidations. IPv6 uses a
    reference in the rt6_info, 'from', to track the corresponding fib entry
    used to create the dst_entry. When validating a dst_entry, the 'from'
    is used to backtrack to the fib6_node and check the sernum of it to the
    cookie passed to the dst_check operation.
    
    With the inline format (nexthop definition inline with the fib6_info),
    dst_entries cached in the fib6_nh have a 1:1 correlation between fib
    entries, nexthop data and dst_entries. With external nexthops, IPv6
    looks more like IPv4 which means multiple fib entries across disparate
    fib6_nodes can all reference the same fib6_nh. That means validation
    of dst_entries based on external nexthops needs to use the IPv4 format
    - the per-network namespace counter.
    
    Add sernum to rt6_info and set it when creating a pcpu dst entry. Update
    rt6_get_cookie to return sernum if it is set and update dst_check for
    IPv6 to look for sernum set and based the check on it if so. Finally,
    rt6_get_pcpu_route needs to validate the cached entry before returning
    a pcpu entry (similar to the rt_cache_valid calls in __mkroute_input and
    __mkroute_output for IPv4).
    
    This problem only affects routes using the new, external nexthops.
    
    Thanks to the kbuild test robot for catching the IS_ENABLED needed
    around rt_genid_ipv6 before I sent this out.

    nvme: fix possible hang when ns scanning fails during error recovery
    
    [ Upstream commit 59c7c3caaaf8750df4ec3255082f15eb4e371514 ]
    
    When the controller is reconnecting, the host fails I/O and admin
    commands as the host cannot reach the controller. ns scanning may
    revalidate namespaces during that period and it is wrong to remove
    namespaces due to these failures as we may hang (see 205da2434301).
    
    One command that may fail is nvme_identify_ns_descs. Since we return
    success due to having ns identify descriptor list optional, we continue
    to compare ns identifiers in nvme_revalidate_disk, obviously fail and
    return -ENODEV to nvme_validate_ns, which will remove the namespace.
    
    Exactly what we don't want to happen.
