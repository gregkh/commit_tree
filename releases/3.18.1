    ALSA: usb-audio: Don't resubmit pending URBs at MIDI error recovery
    
    commit 66139a48cee1530c91f37c145384b4ee7043f0b7 upstream.
    
    In snd_usbmidi_error_timer(), the driver tries to resubmit MIDI input
    URBs to reactivate the MIDI stream, but this causes the error when
    some of URBs are still pending like:

    netlink: use jhash as hashfn for rhashtable
    
    [ Upstream commit 7f19fc5e0b617593dcda0d9956adc78b559ef1f5 ]
    
    For netlink, we shouldn't be using arch_fast_hash() as a hashing
    discipline, but rather jhash() instead.
    
    Since netlink sockets can be opened by any user, a local attacker
    would be able to easily create collisions with the DPDK-derived
    arch_fast_hash(), which trades off performance for security by
    using crc32 CPU instructions on x86_64.
    
    While it might have a legimite use case in other places, it should
    be avoided in netlink context, though. As rhashtable's API is very
    flexible, we could later on still decide on other hashing disciplines,
    if legitimate.

    net: sctp: use MAX_HEADER for headroom reserve in output path
    
    [ Upstream commit 9772b54c55266ce80c639a80aa68eeb908f8ecf5 ]
    
    To accomodate for enough headroom for tunnels, use MAX_HEADER instead
    of LL_MAX_HEADER. Robert reported that he has hit after roughly 40hrs
    of trinity an skb_under_panic() via SCTP output path (see reference).
    I couldn't reproduce it from here, but not using MAX_HEADER as elsewhere
    in other protocols might be one possible cause for this.
    
    In any case, it looks like accounting on chunks themself seems to look
    good as the skb already passed the SCTP output path and did not hit
    any skb_over_panic(). Given tunneling was enabled in his .config, the
    headroom would have been expanded by MAX_HEADER in this case.

    net: mvneta: fix Tx interrupt delay
    
    [ Upstream commit aebea2ba0f7495e1a1c9ea5e753d146cb2f6b845 ]
    
    The mvneta driver sets the amount of Tx coalesce packets to 16 by
    default. Normally that does not cause any trouble since the driver
    uses a much larger Tx ring size (532 packets). But some sockets
    might run with very small buffers, much smaller than the equivalent
    of 16 packets. This is what ping is doing for example, by setting
    SNDBUF to 324 bytes rounded up to 2kB by the kernel.
    
    The problem is that there is no documented method to force a specific
    packet to emit an interrupt (eg: the last of the ring) nor is it
    possible to make the NIC emit an interrupt after a given delay.
    
    In this case, it causes trouble, because when ping sends packets over
    its raw socket, the few first packets leave the system, and the first
    15 packets will be emitted without an IRQ being generated, so without
    the skbs being freed. And since the socket's buffer is small, there's
    no way to reach that amount of packets, and the ping ends up with
    "send: no buffer available" after sending 6 packets. Running with 3
    instances of ping in parallel is enough to hide the problem, because
    with 6 packets per instance, that's 18 packets total, which is enough
    to grant a Tx interrupt before all are sent.
    
    The original driver in the LSP kernel worked around this design flaw
    by using a software timer to clean up the Tx descriptors. This timer
    was slow and caused terrible network performance on some Tx-bound
    workloads (such as routing) but was enough to make tools like ping
    work correctly.
    
    Instead here, we simply set the packet counts before interrupt to 1.
    This ensures that each packet sent will produce an interrupt. NAPI
    takes care of coalescing interrupts since the interrupt is disabled
    once generated.
    
    No measurable performance impact nor CPU usage were observed on small
    nor large packets, including when saturating the link on Tx, and this
    fixes tools like ping which rely on too small a send buffer. If one
    wants to increase this value for certain workloads where it is safe
    to do so, "ethtool -C $dev tx-frames" will override this default
    setting.
    
    This fix needs to be applied to stable kernels starting with 3.10.

    gre: Set inner mac header in gro complete
    
    [ Upstream commit 6fb2a756739aa507c1fd5b8126f0bfc2f070dc46 ]
    
    Set the inner mac header to point to the GRE payload when
    doing GRO. This is needed if we proceed to send the packet
    through GRE GSO which now uses the inner mac header instead
    of inner network header to determine the length of encapsulation
    headers.

    Fix race condition between vxlan_sock_add and vxlan_sock_release
    
    [ Upstream commit 00c83b01d58068dfeb2e1351cca6fccf2a83fa8f ]
    
    Currently, when trying to reuse a socket, vxlan_sock_add will grab
    vn->sock_lock, locate a reusable socket, inc refcount and release
    vn->sock_lock.
    
    But vxlan_sock_release() will first decrement refcount, and then grab
    that lock. refcnt operations are atomic but as currently we have
    deferred works which hold vs->refcnt each, this might happen, leading to
    a use after free (specially after vxlan_igmp_leave):
    
      CPU 1                            CPU 2
    
    deferred work                    vxlan_sock_add
      ...                              ...
                                       spin_lock(&vn->sock_lock)
                                       vs = vxlan_find_sock();
      vxlan_sock_release
        dec vs->refcnt, reaches 0
        spin_lock(&vn->sock_lock)
                                       vxlan_sock_hold(vs), refcnt=1
                                       spin_unlock(&vn->sock_lock)
        hlist_del_rcu(&vs->hlist);
        vxlan_notify_del_rx_port(vs)
        spin_unlock(&vn->sock_lock)
    
    So when we look for a reusable socket, we check if it wasn't freed
    already before reusing it.
