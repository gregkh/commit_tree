    perf tools: Move syscall number fallbacks from perf-sys.h to tools/arch/x86/include/asm/
    
    commit cec07f53c398f22576df77052c4777dc13f14962 upstream.
    
    And remove the empty tools/arch/x86/include/asm/unistd_{32,64}.h files
    introduced by eae7a755ee81 ("perf tools, x86: Build perf on older
    user-space as well").
    
    This way we get closer to mirroring the kernel for cases where __NR_
    can't be found for some include path/_GNU_SOURCE/whatever scenario.

    x86/cpu: Probe CPUID leaf 6 even when cpuid_level == 6
    
    commit 3df8d9208569ef0b2313e516566222d745f3b94b upstream.
    
    A typo (or mis-merge?) resulted in leaf 6 only being probed if
    cpuid_level >= 7.

    Kbuild: fix # escaping in .cmd files for future Make
    
    commit 9564a8cf422d7b58f6e857e3546d346fa970191e upstream.
    
    I tried building using a freshly built Make (4.2.1-69-g8a731d1), but
    already the objtool build broke with
    
    orc_dump.c: In function ‘orc_dump’:
    orc_dump.c:106:2: error: ‘elf_getshnum’ is deprecated [-Werror=deprecated-declarations]
      if (elf_getshdrnum(elf, &nr_sections)) {
    
    Turns out that with that new Make, the backslash was not removed, so cpp
    didn't see a #include directive, grep found nothing, and
    -DLIBELF_USE_DEPRECATED was wrongly put in CFLAGS.
    
    Now, that new Make behaviour is documented in their NEWS file:
    
      * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
        Number signs (#) appearing inside a macro reference or function invocation
        no longer introduce comments and should not be escaped with backslashes:
        thus a call such as:
          foo := $(shell echo '#')
        is legal.  Previously the number sign needed to be escaped, for example:
          foo := $(shell echo '\#')
        Now this latter will resolve to "\#".  If you want to write makefiles
        portable to both versions, assign the number sign to a variable:
          C := \#
          foo := $(shell echo '$C')
        This was claimed to be fixed in 3.81, but wasn't, for some reason.
        To detect this change search for 'nocomment' in the .FEATURES variable.
    
    This also fixes up the two make-cmd instances to replace # with $(pound)
    rather than with \#. There might very well be other places that need
    similar fixup in preparation for whatever future Make release contains
    the above change, but at least this builds an x86_64 defconfig with the
    new make.
