    Btrfs: fix fs corruption on transaction abort if device supports discard
    
    commit 678886bdc6378c1cbd5072da2c5a3035000214e3 upstream.
    
    When we abort a transaction we iterate over all the ranges marked as dirty
    in fs_info->freed_extents[0] and fs_info->freed_extents[1], clear them
    from those trees, add them back (unpin) to the free space caches and, if
    the fs was mounted with "-o discard", perform a discard on those regions.
    Also, after adding the regions to the free space caches, a fitrim ioctl call
    can see those ranges in a block group's free space cache and perform a discard
    on the ranges, so the same issue can happen without "-o discard" as well.
    
    This causes corruption, affecting one or multiple btree nodes (in the worst
    case leaving the fs unmountable) because some of those ranges (the ones in
    the fs_info->pinned_extents tree) correspond to btree nodes/leafs that are
    referred by the last committed super block - breaking the rule that anything
    that was committed by a transaction is untouched until the next transaction
    commits successfully.
    
    I ran into this while running in a loop (for several hours) the fstest that
    I recently submitted:
    
      [PATCH] fstests: add btrfs test to stress chunk allocation/removal and fstrim
    
    The corruption always happened when a transaction aborted and then fsck complained
    like this:
    
       _check_btrfs_filesystem: filesystem on /dev/sdc is inconsistent
       *** fsck.btrfs output ***
       Check tree block failed, want=94945280, have=0
       Check tree block failed, want=94945280, have=0
       Check tree block failed, want=94945280, have=0
       Check tree block failed, want=94945280, have=0
       Check tree block failed, want=94945280, have=0
       read block failed check_tree_block
       Couldn't open file system
    
    In this case 94945280 corresponded to the root of a tree.
    Using frace what I observed was the following sequence of steps happened:
    
       1) transaction N started, fs_info->pinned_extents pointed to
          fs_info->freed_extents[0];
    
       2) node/eb 94945280 is created;
    
       3) eb is persisted to disk;
    
       4) transaction N commit starts, fs_info->pinned_extents now points to
          fs_info->freed_extents[1], and transaction N completes;
    
       5) transaction N + 1 starts;
    
       6) eb is COWed, and btrfs_free_tree_block() called for this eb;
    
       7) eb range (94945280 to 94945280 + 16Kb) is added to
          fs_info->pinned_extents (fs_info->freed_extents[1]);
    
       8) Something goes wrong in transaction N + 1, like hitting ENOSPC
          for example, and the transaction is aborted, turning the fs into
          readonly mode. The stack trace I got for example:
    
          [112065.253935]  [<ffffffff8140c7b6>] dump_stack+0x4d/0x66

          [112065.264997] BTRFS info (device sdc): forced readonly
    
       9) The clear kthread sees that the BTRFS_FS_STATE_ERROR bit is set in
          fs_info->fs_state and calls btrfs_cleanup_transaction(), which in
          turn calls btrfs_destroy_pinned_extent();
    
       10) Then btrfs_destroy_pinned_extent() iterates over all the ranges
           marked as dirty in fs_info->freed_extents[], and for each one
           it calls discard, if the fs was mounted with "-o discard", and
           adds the range to the free space cache of the respective block
           group;
    
       11) btrfs_trim_block_group(), invoked from the fitrim ioctl code path,
           sees the free space entries and performs a discard;
    
       12) After an umount and mount (or fsck), our eb's location on disk was full
           of zeroes, and it should have been untouched, because it was marked as
           dirty in the fs_info->pinned_extents tree, and therefore used by the
           trees that the last committed superblock points to.
    
    Fix this by not performing a discard and not adding the ranges to the free space
    caches - it's useless from this point since the fs is now in readonly mode and
    we won't write free space caches to disk anymore (otherwise we would leak space)
    nor any new superblock. By not adding the ranges to the free space caches, it
    prevents other code paths from allocating that space and write to it as well,
    therefore being safer and simpler.
    
    This isn't a new problem, as it's been present since 2011 (git commit
    acce952b0263825da32cf10489413dec78053347).

    Btrfs: do not move em to modified list when unpinning
    
    commit a28046956c71985046474283fa3bcd256915fb72 upstream.
    
    We use the modified list to keep track of which extents have been modified so we
    know which ones are candidates for logging at fsync() time.  Newly modified
    extents are added to the list at modification time, around the same time the
    ordered extent is created.  We do this so that we don't have to wait for ordered
    extents to complete before we know what we need to log.  The problem is when
    something like this happens
    
    log extent 0-4k on inode 1
    copy csum for 0-4k from ordered extent into log
    sync log
    commit transaction
    log some other extent on inode 1
    ordered extent for 0-4k completes and adds itself onto modified list again
    log changed extents
    see ordered extent for 0-4k has already been logged
            at this point we assume the csum has been copied
    sync log
    crash
    
    On replay we will see the extent 0-4k in the log, drop the original 0-4k extent
    which is the same one that we are replaying which also drops the csum, and then
    we won't find the csum in the log for that bytenr.  This of course causes us to
    have errors about not having csums for certain ranges of our inode.  So remove
    the modified list manipulation in unpin_extent_cache, any modified extents
    should have been added well before now, and we don't want them re-logged.  This
    fixes my test that I could reliably reproduce this problem with.  Thanks,

    eCryptfs: Remove buggy and unnecessary write in file name decode routine
    
    commit 942080643bce061c3dd9d5718d3b745dcb39a8bc upstream.
    
    Dmitry Chernenkov used KASAN to discover that eCryptfs writes past the
    end of the allocated buffer during encrypted filename decoding. This
    fix corrects the issue by getting rid of the unnecessary 0 write when
    the current bit offset is 2.

    eCryptfs: Force RO mount when encrypted view is enabled
    
    commit 332b122d39c9cbff8b799007a825d94b2e7c12f2 upstream.
    
    The ecryptfs_encrypted_view mount option greatly changes the
    functionality of an eCryptfs mount. Instead of encrypting and decrypting
    lower files, it provides a unified view of the encrypted files in the
    lower filesystem. The presence of the ecryptfs_encrypted_view mount
    option is intended to force a read-only mount and modifying files is not
    supported when the feature is in use. See the following commit for more
    information:
    
      e77a56d [PATCH] eCryptfs: Encrypted passthrough
    
    This patch forces the mount to be read-only when the
    ecryptfs_encrypted_view mount option is specified by setting the
    MS_RDONLY flag on the superblock. Additionally, this patch removes some
    broken logic in ecryptfs_open() that attempted to prevent modifications
    of files when the encrypted view feature was in use. The check in
    ecryptfs_open() was not sufficient to prevent file modifications using
    system calls that do not operate on a file descriptor.

    ncpfs: return proper error from NCP_IOC_SETROOT ioctl

    crypto: af_alg - fix backlog handling
    
    commit 7e77bdebff5cb1e9876c561f69710b9ab8fa1f7e upstream.
    
    If a request is backlogged, it's complete() handler will get called
    twice: once with -EINPROGRESS, and once with the final error code.
    
    af_alg's complete handler, unlike other users, does not handle the
    -EINPROGRESS but instead always completes the completion that recvmsg()
    is waiting on.  This can lead to a return to user space while the
    request is still pending in the driver.  If userspace closes the sockets
    before the requests are handled by the driver, this will lead to
    use-after-frees (and potential crashes) in the kernel due to the tfm
    having been freed.
    
    The crashes can be easily reproduced (for example) by reducing the max
    queue length in cryptod.c and running the following (from
    http://www.chronox.de/libkcapi.html) on AES-NI capable hardware:
    
     $ while true; do kcapi -x 1 -e -c '__ecb-aes-aesni' \

    audit: restore AUDIT_LOGINUID unset ABI
    
    commit 041d7b98ffe59c59fdd639931dea7d74f9aa9a59 upstream.
    
    A regression was caused by commit 780a7654cee8:
             audit: Make testing for a valid loginuid explicit.
    (which in turn attempted to fix a regression caused by e1760bd)
    
    When audit_krule_to_data() fills in the rules to get a listing, there was a
    missing clause to convert back from AUDIT_LOGINUID_SET to AUDIT_LOGINUID.
    
    This broke userspace by not returning the same information that was sent and
    expected.
    
    The rule:
            auditctl -a exit,never -F auid=-1
    gives:
            auditctl -l
                    LIST_RULES: exit,never f24=0 syscall=all
    when it should give:
                    LIST_RULES: exit,never auid=-1 (0xffffffff) syscall=all
    
    Tag it so that it is reported the same way it was set.  Create a new
    private flags audit_krule field (pflags) to store it that won't interact with
    the public one from the API.

    userns: Allow setting gid_maps without privilege when setgroups is disabled
    
    commit 66d2f338ee4c449396b6f99f5e75cd18eb6df272 upstream.
    
    Now that setgroups can be disabled and not reenabled, setting gid_map
    without privielge can now be enabled when setgroups is disabled.
    
    This restores most of the functionality that was lost when unprivileged
    setting of gid_map was removed.  Applications that use this functionality
    will need to check to see if they use setgroups or init_groups, and if they
    don't they can be fixed by simply disabling setgroups before writing to
    gid_map.

    userns: Add a knob to disable setgroups on a per user namespace basis
    
    commit 9cc46516ddf497ea16e8d7cb986ae03a0f6b92f8 upstream.
    
    - Expose the knob to user space through a proc file /proc/<pid>/setgroups
    
      A value of "deny" means the setgroups system call is disabled in the
      current processes user namespace and can not be enabled in the
      future in this user namespace.
    
      A value of "allow" means the segtoups system call is enabled.
    
    - Descendant user namespaces inherit the value of setgroups from
      their parents.
    
    - A proc file is used (instead of a sysctl) as sysctls currently do
      not allow checking the permissions at open time.
    
    - Writing to the proc file is restricted to before the gid_map
      for the user namespace is set.
    
      This ensures that disabling setgroups at a user namespace
      level will never remove the ability to call setgroups
      from a process that already has that ability.
    
      A process may opt in to the setgroups disable for itself by
      creating, entering and configuring a user namespace or by calling
      setns on an existing user namespace with setgroups disabled.
      Processes without privileges already can not call setgroups so this
      is a noop.  Prodcess with privilege become processes without
      privilege when entering a user namespace and as with any other path
      to dropping privilege they would not have the ability to call
      setgroups.  So this remains within the bounds of what is possible
      without a knob to disable setgroups permanently in a user namespace.

    userns: Only allow the creator of the userns unprivileged mappings
    
    commit f95d7918bd1e724675de4940039f2865e5eec5fe upstream.
    
    If you did not create the user namespace and are allowed
    to write to uid_map or gid_map you should already have the necessary
    privilege in the parent user namespace to establish any mapping
    you want so this will not affect userspace in practice.
    
    Limiting unprivileged uid mapping establishment to the creator of the
    user namespace makes it easier to verify all credentials obtained with
    the uid mapping can be obtained without the uid mapping without
    privilege.
    
    Limiting unprivileged gid mapping establishment (which is temporarily
    absent) to the creator of the user namespace also ensures that the
    combination of uid and gid can already be obtained without privilege.
    
    This is part of the fix for CVE-2014-8989.

    userns: Check euid no fsuid when establishing an unprivileged uid mapping
    
    commit 80dd00a23784b384ccea049bfb3f259d3f973b9d upstream.
    
    setresuid allows the euid to be set to any of uid, euid, suid, and
    fsuid.  Therefor it is safe to allow an unprivileged user to map
    their euid and use CAP_SETUID privileged with exactly that uid,
    as no new credentials can be obtained.
    
    I can not find a combination of existing system calls that allows setting
    uid, euid, suid, and fsuid from the fsuid making the previous use
    of fsuid for allowing unprivileged mappings a bug.

    userns: Don't allow unprivileged creation of gid mappings
    
    commit be7c6dba2332cef0677fbabb606e279ae76652c3 upstream.
    
    As any gid mapping will allow and must allow for backwards
    compatibility dropping groups don't allow any gid mappings to be
    established without CAP_SETGID in the parent user namespace.
    
    For a small class of applications this change breaks userspace
    and removes useful functionality.  This small class of applications
    includes tools/testing/selftests/mount/unprivilged-remount-test.c
    
    Most of the removed functionality will be added back with the addition
    of a one way knob to disable setgroups.  Once setgroups is disabled
    setting the gid_map becomes as safe as setting the uid_map.
    
    For more common applications that set the uid_map and the gid_map
    with privilege this change will have no affect.
    
    This is part of a fix for CVE-2014-8989.

    userns: Don't allow setgroups until a gid mapping has been setablished
    
    commit 273d2c67c3e179adb1e74f403d1e9a06e3f841b5 upstream.
    
    setgroups is unique in not needing a valid mapping before it can be called,
    in the case of setgroups(0, NULL) which drops all supplemental groups.
    
    The design of the user namespace assumes that CAP_SETGID can not actually
    be used until a gid mapping is established.  Therefore add a helper function
    to see if the user namespace gid mapping has been established and call
    that function in the setgroups permission check.
    
    This is part of the fix for CVE-2014-8989, being able to drop groups
    without privilege using user namespaces.

    userns: Document what the invariant required for safe unprivileged mappings.
    
    commit 0542f17bf2c1f2430d368f44c8fcf2f82ec9e53e upstream.
    
    The rule is simple.  Don't allow anything that wouldn't be allowed
    without unprivileged mappings.
    
    It was previously overlooked that establishing gid mappings would
    allow dropping groups and potentially gaining permission to files and
    directories that had lesser permissions for a specific group than for
    all other users.
    
    This is the rule needed to fix CVE-2014-8989 and prevent any other
    security issues with new_idmap_permitted.
    
    The reason for this rule is that the unix permission model is old and
    there are programs out there somewhere that take advantage of every
    little corner of it.  So allowing a uid or gid mapping to be
    established without privielge that would allow anything that would not
    be allowed without that mapping will result in expectations from some
    code somewhere being violated.  Violated expectations about the
    behavior of the OS is a long way to say a security issue.

    commit 7ff4d90b4c24a03666f296c3d4878cd39001e81e upstream.
    
    Today there are 3 instances of setgroups and due to an oversight their
    permission checking has diverged.  Add a common function so that
    they may all share the same permission checking code.
    
    This corrects the current oversight in the current permission checks
    and adds a helper to avoid this in the future.
    
    A user namespace security fix will update this new helper, shortly.

    Forced unmount affects not just the mount namespace but the underlying
    superblock as well.  Restrict forced unmount to the global root user
    for now.  Otherwise it becomes possible a user in a less privileged
    mount namespace to force the shutdown of a superblock of a filesystem
    in a more privileged mount namespace, allowing a DOS attack on root.

    mnt: Fix a memory stomp in umount
    
    commit c297abfdf15b4480704d6b566ca5ca9438b12456 upstream.
    
    While reviewing the code of umount_tree I realized that when we append
    to a preexisting unmounted list we do not change pprev of the former
    first item in the list.
    
    Which means later in namespace_unlock hlist_del_init(&mnt->mnt_hash) on
    the former first item of the list will stomp unmounted.first leaving
    it set to some random mount point which we are likely to free soon.
    
    This isn't likely to hit, but if it does I don't know how anyone could
    track it down.
    
    [ This happened because we don't have all the same operations for
      hlist's as we do for normal doubly-linked lists. In particular,
      list_splice() is easy on our standard doubly-linked lists, while
      hlist_splice() doesn't exist and needs both start/end entries of the
      hlist.  And commit 38129a13e6e7 incorrectly open-coded that missing
      hlist_splice().
    
      We should think about making these kinds of "mindless" conversions
      easier to get right by adding the missing hlist helpers   - Linus ]

    KEYS: Fix stale key registration at error path
    
    commit b26bdde5bb27f3f900e25a95e33a0c476c8c2c48 upstream.
    
    When loading encrypted-keys module, if the last check of
    aes_get_sizes() in init_encrypted() fails, the driver just returns an
    error without unregistering its key type.  This results in the stale
    entry in the list.  In addition to memory leaks, this leads to a kernel
    crash when registering a new key type later.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by swapping the calls of aes_get_sizes()
    and register_key_type(), and releasing resources properly at the error
    paths.

    It turns out that there's a lurking ABI issue.  GCC, when
    compiling this in a 32-bit program:
    
    struct user_desc desc = {
            .entry_number    = idx,
            .base_addr       = base,
            .limit           = 0xfffff,
            .seg_32bit       = 1,
            .contents        = 0, /* Data, grow-up */
            .read_exec_only  = 0,
            .limit_in_pages  = 1,
            .seg_not_present = 0,
            .useable         = 0,
    };
    
    will leave .lm uninitialized.  This means that anything in the
    kernel that reads user_desc.lm for 32-bit tasks is unreliable.
    
    Revert the .lm check in set_thread_area().  The value never did
    anything in the first place.

    dm thin: fix missing out-of-data-space to write mode transition if blocks are released
    
    commit 2c43fd26e46734430122b8d2ad3024bb532df3ef upstream.
    
    Discard bios and thin device deletion have the potential to release data
    blocks.  If the thin-pool is in out-of-data-space mode, and blocks were
    released, transition the thin-pool back to full write mode.
    
    The correct time to do this is just after the thin-pool metadata commit.
    It cannot be done before the commit because the space maps will not
    allow immediate reuse of the data blocks in case there's a rollback
    following power failure.

    dm thin: fix inability to discard blocks when in out-of-data-space mode
    
    commit 45ec9bd0fd7abf8705e7cf12205ff69fe9d51181 upstream.
    
    When the pool was in PM_OUT_OF_SPACE mode its process_prepared_discard
    function pointer was incorrectly being set to
    process_prepared_discard_passdown rather than process_prepared_discard.
    
    This incorrect function pointer meant the discard was being passed down,
    but not effecting the mapping.  As such any discard that was issued, in
    an attempt to reclaim blocks, would not successfully free data space.

    commit 1e32134a5a404e80bfb47fad8a94e9bbfcbdacc5 upstream.
    
    If the incoming bio is a WRITE and completely covers a block then we
    don't bother to do any copying for a promotion operation.  Once this is
    done the cache block and origin block will be different, so we need to
    set it to 'dirty'.

    dm bufio: fix memleak when using a dm_buffer's inline bio
    
    commit 445559cdcb98a141f5de415b94fd6eaccab87e6d upstream.
    
    When dm-bufio sets out to use the bio built into a struct dm_buffer to
    issue an IO, it needs to call bio_reset after it's done with the bio
    so that we can free things attached to the bio such as the integrity
    payload.  Therefore, inject our own endio callback to take care of
    the bio_reset after calling submit_io's end_io callback.
    
    Test case:
    1. modprobe scsi_debug delay=0 dif=1 dix=199 ato=1 dev_size_mb=300
    2. Set up a dm-bufio client, e.g. dm-verity, on the scsi_debug device
    3. Repeatedly read metadata and watch kmalloc-192 leak!

    not to hit this problem.

    commit 1a5fb99de4850cba710d91becfa2c65653048589 upstream.
    
    Some boards with TC6393XB chip require full state restore during system
    resume thanks to chip's VCC being cut off during suspend (Sharp SL-6000
    tosa is one of them). Failing to do so would result in ohci Oops on
    resume due to internal memory contentes being changed. Fail ohci suspend
    on tc6393xb is full state restore is required.
    
    Recommended workaround is to unbind tmio-ohci driver before suspend and
    rebind it after resume.

    md/bitmap: always wait for writes on unplug.
    
    commit 4b5060ddae2b03c5387321fafc089d242225697a upstream.
    
    If two threads call bitmap_unplug at the same time, then
    one might schedule all the writes, and the other might
    decide that it doesn't need to wait.  But really it does.
    
    It rarely hurts to wait when it isn't absolutely necessary,
    and the current code doesn't really focus on 'absolutely necessary'
    anyway.  So just wait always.
    
    This can potentially lead to data corruption if a crash happens
    at an awkward time and data was written before the bitmap was
    updated.  It is very unlikely, but this should go to -stable
    just to be safe.  Appropriate for any -stable.

    x86, kvm: Clear paravirt_enabled on KVM guests for espfix32's benefit
    
    commit 29fa6825463c97e5157284db80107d1bfac5d77b upstream.
    
    paravirt_enabled has the following effects:
    
     - Disables the F00F bug workaround warning.  There is no F00F bug
       workaround any more because Linux's standard IDT handling already
       works around the F00F bug, but the warning still exists.  This
       is only cosmetic, and, in any event, there is no such thing as
       KVM on a CPU with the F00F bug.
    
     - Disables 32-bit APM BIOS detection.  On a KVM paravirt system,
       there should be no APM BIOS anyway.
    
     - Disables tboot.  I think that the tboot code should check the
       CPUID hypervisor bit directly if it matters.
    
     - paravirt_enabled disables espfix32.  espfix32 should *not* be
       disabled under KVM paravirt.
    
    The last point is the purpose of this patch.  It fixes a leak of the
    high 16 bits of the kernel stack address on 32-bit KVM paravirt
    guests.  Fixes CVE-2014-8134.

    x86/tls: Disallow unusual TLS segments
    
    commit 0e58af4e1d2166e9e33375a0f121e4867010d4f8 upstream.
    
    Users have no business installing custom code segments into the
    GDT, and segments that are not present but are otherwise valid
    are a historical source of interesting attacks.
    
    For completeness, block attempts to set the L bit.  (Prior to
    this patch, the L bit would have been silently dropped.)
    
    This is an ABI break.  I've checked glibc, musl, and Wine, and
    none of them look like they'll have any trouble.
    
    Note to stable maintainers: this is a hardening patch that fixes
    no known bugs.  Given the possibility of ABI issues, this
    probably shouldn't be backported quickly.

    x86/tls: Validate TLS entries to protect espfix
    
    commit 41bdc78544b8a93a9c6814b8bbbfef966272abbe upstream.
    
    Installing a 16-bit RW data segment into the GDT defeats espfix.
    AFAICT this will not affect glibc, Wine, or dosemu at all.

    isofs: Fix infinite looping over CE entries
    
    commit f54e18f1b831c92f6512d2eedb224cd63d607d3d upstream.
    
    Rock Ridge extensions define so called Continuation Entries (CE) which
    define where is further space with Rock Ridge data. Corrupted isofs
    image can contain arbitrarily long chain of these, including a one
    containing loop and thus causing kernel to end in an infinite loop when
    traversing these entries.
    
    Limit the traversal to 32 entries which should be more than enough space
    to store all the Rock Ridge data.
