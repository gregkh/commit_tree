    mwifiex: Fix possible buffer overflows in mwifiex_cmd_802_11_ad_hoc_start
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c455c5ab332773464d02ba17015acdca198f03d ]
    
    mwifiex_cmd_802_11_ad_hoc_start() calls memcpy() without checking
    the destination size may trigger a buffer overflower,
    which a local user could use to cause denial of service
    or the execution of arbitrary code.
    Fix it by putting the length check before calling memcpy().

    iio:magnetometer:mag3110: Fix alignment and data leak issues.
    
    commit 89deb1334252ea4a8491d47654811e28b0790364 upstream
    
    One of a class of bugs pointed out by Lars in a recent review.
    iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp() assumes the buffer used is aligned
    to the size of the timestamp (8 bytes).  This is not guaranteed in
    this driver which uses an array of smaller elements on the stack.
    As Lars also noted this anti pattern can involve a leak of data to
    userspace and that indeed can happen here.  We close both issues by
    moving to a suitable structure in the iio_priv() data.
    This data is allocated with kzalloc() so no data can leak apart from
    previous readings.
    
    The explicit alignment of ts is not necessary in this case but
    does make the code slightly less fragile so I have included it.

    commit dd4ba3fb22233e69f06399ee0aa7ecb11d2b595c upstream

    xenbus/xenbus_backend: Disallow pending watch messages
    
    commit 9996bd494794a2fe393e97e7a982388c6249aa76 upstream.
    
    'xenbus_backend' watches 'state' of devices, which is writable by
    guests.  Hence, if guests intensively updates it, dom0 will have lots of
    pending events that exhausting memory of dom0.  In other words, guests
    can trigger dom0 memory pressure.  This is known as XSA-349.  However,
    the watch callback of it, 'frontend_changed()', reads only 'state', so
    doesn't need to have the pending events.
    
    To avoid the problem, this commit disallows pending watch messages for
    'xenbus_backend' using the 'will_handle()' watch callback.

    xen/xenbus: Allow watches discard events before queueing
    
    commit fed1755b118147721f2c87b37b9d66e62c39b668 upstream.
    
    If handling logics of watch events are slower than the events enqueue
    logic and the events can be created from the guests, the guests could
    trigger memory pressure by intensively inducing the events, because it
    will create a huge number of pending events that exhausting the memory.
    
    Fortunately, some watch events could be ignored, depending on its
    handler callback.  For example, if the callback has interest in only one
    single path, the watch wouldn't want multiple pending events.  Or, some
    watches could ignore events to same path.
    
    To let such watches to volutarily help avoiding the memory pressure
    situation, this commit introduces new watch callback, 'will_handle'.  If
    it is not NULL, it will be called for each new event just before
    enqueuing it.  Then, if the callback returns false, the event will be
    discarded.  No watch is using the callback for now, though.

    module: delay kobject uevent until after module init call
    
    [ Upstream commit 38dc717e97153e46375ee21797aa54777e5498f3 ]
    
    Apparently there has been a longstanding race between udev/systemd and
    the module loader. Currently, the module loader sends a uevent right
    after sysfs initialization, but before the module calls its init
    function. However, some udev rules expect that the module has
    initialized already upon receiving the uevent.
    
    This race has been triggered recently (see link in references) in some
    systemd mount unit files. For instance, the configfs module creates the
    /sys/kernel/config mount point in its init function, however the module
    loader issues the uevent before this happens. sys-kernel-config.mount
    expects to be able to mount /sys/kernel/config upon receipt of the
    module loading uevent, but if the configfs module has not called its
    init function yet, then this directory will not exist and the mount unit
    fails. A similar situation exists for sys-fs-fuse-connections.mount, as
    the fuse sysfs mount point is created during the fuse module's init
    function. If udev is faster than module initialization then the mount
    unit would fail in a similar fashion.
    
    To fix this race, delay the module KOBJ_ADD uevent until after the
    module has finished calling its init routine.

    quota: Don't overflow quota file offsets

    The on-disk quota format supports quota files with upto 2^32 blocks. Be
    careful when computing quota file offsets in the quota files from block
    numbers as they can overflow 32-bit types. Since quota files larger than
    4GB would require ~26 millions of quota users, this is mostly a
    theoretical concern now but better be careful, fuzzers would find the
    problem sooner or later anyway...

    ALSA: seq: Use bool for snd_seq_queue internal flags
    
    commit 4ebd47037027c4beae99680bff3b20fdee5d7c1e upstream.
    
    The snd_seq_queue struct contains various flags in the bit fields.
    Those are categorized to two different use cases, both of which are
    protected by different spinlocks.  That implies that there are still
    potential risks of the bad operations for bit fields by concurrent
    accesses.
    
    For addressing the problem, this patch rearranges those flags to be
    a standard bool instead of a bit field.

            - if firmware has loaded;
            - if the LNBf was powered on.
    
    Using status = 0 seems to ensure that everything will be
    properly powered up.
    
    So, instead of the proposed solution, let's just set
    status = 0.

    misc: vmw_vmci: fix kernel info-leak by initializing dbells in vmci_ctx_get_chkpt_doorbells()
    
    commit 31dcb6c30a26d32650ce134820f27de3c675a45a upstream.
    
    A kernel-infoleak was reported by syzbot, which was caused because
    dbells was left uninitialized.
    Using kzalloc() instead of kmalloc() fixes this issue.

    of: fix linker-section match-table corruption
    
    commit 5812b32e01c6d86ba7a84110702b46d8a8531fe9 upstream.
    
    Specify type alignment when declaring linker-section match-table entries
    to prevent gcc from increasing alignment and corrupting the various
    tables with padding (e.g. timers, irqchips, clocks, reserved memory).
    
    This is specifically needed on x86 where gcc (typically) aligns larger
    objects like struct of_device_id with static extent on 32-byte
    boundaries which at best prevents matching on anything but the first
    entry. Specifying alignment when declaring variables suppresses this
    optimisation.
    
    Here's a 64-bit example where all entries are corrupt as 16 bytes of
    padding has been inserted before the first entry:
    
            ffffffff8266b4b0 D __clk_of_table
            ffffffff8266b4c0 d __of_table_fixed_factor_clk
            ffffffff8266b5a0 d __of_table_fixed_clk
            ffffffff8266b680 d __clk_of_table_sentinel
    
    And here's a 32-bit example where the 8-byte-aligned table happens to be
    placed on a 32-byte boundary so that all but the first entry are corrupt
    due to the 28 bytes of padding inserted between entries:
    
            812b3ec0 D __irqchip_of_table
            812b3ec0 d __of_table_irqchip1
            812b3fa0 d __of_table_irqchip2
            812b4080 d __of_table_irqchip3
            812b4160 d irqchip_of_match_end
    
    Verified on x86 using gcc-9.3 and gcc-4.9 (which uses 64-byte
    alignment), and on arm using gcc-7.2.
    
    Note that there are no in-tree users of these tables on x86 currently
    (even if they are included in the image).

    uapi: move constants from <linux/kernel.h> to <linux/const.h>

    l2tp: fix races with ipv4-mapped ipv6 addresses
    
    commit b954f94023dcc61388c8384f0f14eb8e42c863c5 upstream.
    
    The l2tp_tunnel_create() function checks for v4mapped ipv6
    sockets and cache that flag, so that l2tp core code can
    reusing it at xmit time.
    
    If the socket is provided by the userspace, the connection
    status of the tunnel sockets can change between the tunnel
    creation and the xmit call, so that syzbot is able to
    trigger the following splat:

    This change addresses the issues:
    * explicitly checking for TCP_ESTABLISHED for user space provided sockets
    * dropping the v4mapped flag usage - it can become outdated - and
      explicitly invoking ipv6_addr_v4mapped() instead
    
    The issue is apparently there since ancient times.
    
    v1 -> v2: (many thanks to Guillaume)
     - with csum issue introduced in v1
     - replace pr_err with pr_debug
     - fix build issue with IPV6 disabled
     - move l2tp_sk_is_v4mapped in l2tp_core.c
    
    v2 -> v3:
     - don't update inet_daddr for v4mapped address, unneeded
     - drop rendundant check at creation time

    net: ipv6: keep sk status consistent after datagram connect failure
    
    commit 2f987a76a97773beafbc615b9c4d8fe79129a7f4 upstream.
    
    On unsuccesful ip6_datagram_connect(), if the failure is caused by
    ip6_datagram_dst_update(), the sk peer information are cleared, but
    the sk->sk_state is preserved.
    
    If the socket was already in an established status, the overall sk
    status is inconsistent and fouls later checks in datagram code.
    
    Fix this saving the old peer information and restoring them in
    case of failure. This also aligns ipv6 datagram connect() behavior
    with ipv4.
    
    v1 -> v2:

    s390/dasd: fix hanging device offline processing
    
    [ Upstream commit 658a337a606f48b7ebe451591f7681d383fa115e ]
    
    For an LCU update a read unit address configuration IO is required.
    This is started using sleep_on(), which has early exit paths in case the
    device is not usable for IO. For example when it is in offline processing.
    
    In those cases the LCU update should fail and not be retried.
    Therefore lcu_update_work checks if EOPNOTSUPP is returned or not.
    
    Commit 41995342b40c ("s390/dasd: fix endless loop after read unit address configuration")
    accidentally removed the EOPNOTSUPP return code from
    read_unit_address_configuration(), which in turn might lead to an endless
    loop of the LCU update in offline processing.
    
    Fix by returning EOPNOTSUPP again if the device is not able to perform the
    request.

    ALSA: usb-audio: fix sync-ep altsetting sanity check
    
    commit 5d1b71226dc4d44b4b65766fa9d74492f9d4587b upstream
    
    The altsetting sanity check in set_sync_ep_implicit_fb_quirk() was
    checking for there to be at least one altsetting but then went on to
    access the second one, which may not exist.
    
    This could lead to random slab data being used to initialise the sync
    endpoint in snd_usb_add_endpoint().

    ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Fix work handling in delayed HP detection
    
    commit 42fb6b1d41eb5905d77c06cad2e87b70289bdb76 upstream
    
    CA0132 has the delayed HP jack detection code that is invoked from the
    unsol handler, but it does a few weird things: it contains the cancel
    of a work inside the work handler, and yet it misses the cancel-sync
    call at (runtime-)suspend.  This patch addresses those issues.
    
    Fixes: 15c2b3cc09a3 ("ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Fix possible workqueue stall")

    x86/entry/64: Add instruction suffix
    
    commit a368d7fd2a3c6babb852fe974018dd97916bcd3b upstream.
    
    Omitting suffixes from instructions in AT&T mode is bad practice when
    operand size cannot be determined by the assembler from register
    operands, and is likely going to be warned about by upstream gas in the
    future (mine does already). Add the single missing suffix here.
