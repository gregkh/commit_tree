    f2fs: fix to avoid racing on fsync_entry_slab by multi filesystem instances
    
    commit cad83c968c2ebe97905f900326988ed37146c347 upstream.
    
    As syzbot reported, there is an use-after-free issue during f2fs recovery:
    
    Use-after-free write at 0xffff88823bc16040 (in kfence-#10):
     kmem_cache_destroy+0x1f/0x120 mm/slab_common.c:486

     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae
    
    The root cause is multi f2fs filesystem instances can race on accessing
    global fsync_entry_slab pointer, result in use-after-free issue of slab
    cache, fixes to init/destroy this slab cache only once during module
    init/destroy procedure to avoid this issue.

    media: v4l2-core: explicitly clear ioctl input data
    
    commit 7b53cca764f9b291b7907fcd39d9e66ad728ee0b upstream.
    
    As seen from a recent syzbot bug report, mistakes in the compat ioctl
    implementation can lead to uninitialized kernel stack data getting used
    as input for driver ioctl handlers.
    
    The reported bug is now fixed, but it's possible that other related
    bugs are still present or get added in the future. As the drivers need
    to check user input already, the possible impact is fairly low, but it
    might still cause an information leak.
    
    To be on the safe side, always clear the entire ioctl buffer before
    calling the conversion handler functions that are meant to initialize
    them.

    ext4: fix possible UAF when remounting r/o a mmp-protected file system
    
    commit 61bb4a1c417e5b95d9edb4f887f131de32e419cb upstream.
    
    After commit 618f003199c6 ("ext4: fix memory leak in
    ext4_fill_super"), after the file system is remounted read-only, there
    is a race where the kmmpd thread can exit, causing sbi->s_mmp_tsk to
    point at freed memory, which the call to ext4_stop_mmpd() can trip
    over.
    
    Fix this by only allowing kmmpd() to exit when it is stopped via
    ext4_stop_mmpd().

    media: uvcvideo: Fix pixel format change for Elgato Cam Link 4K
    
    commit 4c6e0976295add7f0ed94d276c04a3d6f1ea8f83 upstream.
    
    The Elgato Cam Link 4K HDMI video capture card reports to support three
    different pixel formats, where the first format depends on the connected
    HDMI device.
    
    ```
    $ v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --list-formats-ext
    ioctl: VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT
            Type: Video Capture
    
            [0]: 'NV12' (Y/CbCr 4:2:0)
                    Size: Discrete 3840x2160
                            Interval: Discrete 0.033s (29.970 fps)
            [1]: 'NV12' (Y/CbCr 4:2:0)
                    Size: Discrete 3840x2160
                            Interval: Discrete 0.033s (29.970 fps)
            [2]: 'YU12' (Planar YUV 4:2:0)
                    Size: Discrete 3840x2160
                            Interval: Discrete 0.033s (29.970 fps)
    ```
    
    Changing the pixel format to anything besides the first pixel format
    does not work:
    
    ```
    $ v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --try-fmt-video pixelformat=YU12
    Format Video Capture:
            Width/Height      : 3840/2160
            Pixel Format      : 'NV12' (Y/CbCr 4:2:0)
            Field             : None
            Bytes per Line    : 3840
            Size Image        : 12441600
            Colorspace        : sRGB
            Transfer Function : Rec. 709
            YCbCr/HSV Encoding: Rec. 709
            Quantization      : Default (maps to Limited Range)
            Flags             :
    ```
    
    User space applications like VLC might show an error message on the
    terminal in that case:
    
    ```
    libv4l2: error set_fmt gave us a different result than try_fmt!
    ```
    
    Depending on the error handling of the user space applications, they
    might display a distorted video, because they use the wrong pixel format
    for decoding the stream.
    
    The Elgato Cam Link 4K responds to the USB video probe
    VS_PROBE_CONTROL/VS_COMMIT_CONTROL with a malformed data structure: The
    second byte contains bFormatIndex (instead of being the second byte of
    bmHint). The first byte is always zero. The third byte is always 1.
    
    The firmware bug was reported to Elgato on 2020-12-01 and it was
    forwarded by the support team to the developers as feature request.
    There is no firmware update available since then. The latest firmware
    for Elgato Cam Link 4K as of 2021-03-23 has MCU 20.02.19 and FPGA 67.
    
    Therefore correct the malformed data structure for this device. The
    change was successfully tested with VLC, OBS, and Chromium using
    different pixel formats (YUYV, NV12, YU12), resolutions (3840x2160,
    1920x1080), and frame rates (29.970 and 59.940 fps).

    commit b4bb4d425b7b02424afea2dfdcd77b3b4794175e upstream.
    
    The direction of the pipe argument must match the request-type direction
    bit or control requests may fail depending on the host-controller-driver
    implementation.
    
    Control transfers without a data stage are treated as OUT requests by
    the USB stack and should be using usb_sndctrlpipe(). Failing to do so
    will now trigger a warning.
    
    Fix the single zero-length control request which was using the
    read-register helper, and update the helper so that zero-length reads
    fail with an error message instead.

    The direction of the pipe argument must match the request-type direction
    bit or control requests may fail depending on the host-controller-driver
    implementation.
    
    Fix the control requests which erroneously used usb_rcvctrlpipe().

    media: i2c: ccs-core: fix pm_runtime_get_sync() usage count
    
    commit da3a1858c3a37c09446e1470c48352897d59d11b upstream.
    
    The pm_runtime_get_sync() internally increments the
    dev->power.usage_count without decrementing it, even on errors.
    
    There is a bug at ccs_pm_get_init(): when this function returns
    an error, the stream is not started, and RPM usage_count
    should not be incremented. However, if the calls to
    v4l2_ctrl_handler_setup() return errors, it will be kept
    incremented.
    
    At ccs_suspend() the best is to replace it by the new
    pm_runtime_resume_and_get(), introduced by:
    commit dd8088d5a896 ("PM: runtime: Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter")
    in order to properly decrement the usage counter automatically,
    in the case of errors.

    media: subdev: disallow ioctl for saa6588/davinci
    
    commit 0a7790be182d32b9b332a37cb4206e24fe94b728 upstream.
    
    The saa6588_ioctl() function expects to get called from other kernel
    functions with a 'saa6588_command' pointer, but I found nothing stops it
    from getting called from user space instead, which seems rather dangerous.
    
    The same thing happens in the davinci vpbe driver with its VENC_GET_FLD
    command.
    
    As a quick fix, add a separate .command() callback pointer for this
    driver and change the two callers over to that.  This change can easily
    get backported to stable kernels if necessary, but since there are only
    two drivers, we may want to eventually replace this with a set of more
    specialized callbacks in the long run.

    PCI: aardvark: Implement workaround for the readback value of VEND_ID
    
    commit 7f71a409fe3d9358da07c77f15bb5b7960f12253 upstream.
    
    Marvell Armada 3700 Functional Errata, Guidelines, and Restrictions
    document describes in erratum 4.1 PCIe value of vendor ID (Ref #: 243):
    
        The readback value of VEND_ID (RD0070000h [15:0]) is 1B4Bh, while it
        should read 11ABh.
    
        The firmware can write the correct value, 11ABh, through VEND_ID
        (RD0076044h [15:0]).
    
    Implement this workaround in aardvark driver for both PCI vendor id and PCI
    subsystem vendor id.
    
    This change affects and fixes PCI vendor id of emulated PCIe root bridge.
    After this change emulated PCIe root bridge has correct vendor id.

    PCI: Leave Apple Thunderbolt controllers on for s2idle or standby
    
    commit 4694ae373dc2114f9a82f6ae15737e65af0c6dea upstream.
    
    On Macbook 2013, resuming from suspend-to-idle or standby resulted in the
    external monitor no longer being detected, a stacktrace, and errors like
    this in dmesg:
    
      pcieport 0000:06:00.0: can't change power state from D3hot to D0 (config space inaccessible)
    
    The reason is that we know how to turn power to the Thunderbolt controller
    *off* via the SXIO/SXFP/SXLF methods, but we don't know how to turn power
    back on.  We have to rely on firmware to turn the power back on.
    
    When going to the "suspend-to-idle" or "standby" system sleep states,
    firmware is not involved either on the suspend side or the resume side, so
    we can't use SXIO/SXFP/SXLF to turn the power off.
    
    Skip SXIO/SXFP/SXLF when firmware isn't involved in suspend, e.g., when
    we're going to the "suspend-to-idle" or "standby" system sleep states.

    dm btree remove: assign new_root only when removal succeeds
    
    commit b6e58b5466b2959f83034bead2e2e1395cca8aeb upstream.

    dm writecache: flush origin device when writing and cache is full
    
    commit ee55b92a7391bf871939330f662651b54be51b73 upstream.
    
    Commit d53f1fafec9d086f1c5166436abefdaef30e0363 ("dm writecache: do
    direct write if the cache is full") changed dm-writecache, so that it
    writes directly to the origin device if the cache is full.
    Unfortunately, it doesn't forward flush requests to the origin device,
    so that there is a bug where flushes are being ignored.
    
    Fix this by adding missing flush forwarding.
    
    For PMEM mode, we fix this bug by disabling direct writes to the origin
    device, because it performs better.

    The dm-zoned target cannot support zoned block devices with zones that

    due to the current chunk zone mapping implementation as it is assumed

    But later, iounmap() is called to free tpci200->info->cfg_regs
    again.
    
    My patch sets tpci200->info->cfg_regs to NULL after tpci200_uninstall()
    to avoid the double free.

    tracing: Resize tgid_map to pid_max, not PID_MAX_DEFAULT
    
    commit 4030a6e6a6a4a42ff8c18414c9e0c93e24cc70b8 upstream.
    
    Currently tgid_map is sized at PID_MAX_DEFAULT entries, which means that
    on systems where pid_max is configured higher than PID_MAX_DEFAULT the
    ftrace record-tgid option doesn't work so well. Any tasks with PIDs
    higher than PID_MAX_DEFAULT are simply not recorded in tgid_map, and
    don't show up in the saved_tgids file.
    
    In particular since systemd v243 & above configure pid_max to its
    highest possible 1<<22 value by default on 64 bit systems this renders
    the record-tgids option of little use.
    
    Increase the size of tgid_map to the configured pid_max instead,
    allowing it to cover the full range of PIDs up to the maximum value of
    PID_MAX_LIMIT if the system is configured that way.
    
    On 64 bit systems with pid_max == PID_MAX_LIMIT this will increase the
    size of tgid_map from 256KiB to 16MiB. Whilst this 64x increase in
    memory overhead sounds significant 64 bit systems are presumably best
    placed to accommodate it, and since tgid_map is only allocated when the
    record-tgid option is actually used presumably the user would rather it
    spends sufficient memory to actually record the tgids they expect.
    
    The size of tgid_map could also increase for CONFIG_BASE_SMALL=y
    configurations, but these seem unlikely to be systems upon which people
    are both configuring a large pid_max and running ftrace with record-tgid
    anyway.
    
    Of note is that we only allocate tgid_map once, the first time that the
    record-tgid option is enabled. Therefore its size is only set once, to
    the value of pid_max at the time the record-tgid option is first
    enabled. If a user increases pid_max after that point, the saved_tgids
    file will not contain entries for any tasks with pids beyond the earlier
    value of pid_max.

    tracing: Simplify & fix saved_tgids logic
    
    commit b81b3e959adb107cd5b36c7dc5ba1364bbd31eb2 upstream.
    
    The tgid_map array records a mapping from pid to tgid, where the index
    of an entry within the array is the pid & the value stored at that index
    is the tgid.
    
    The saved_tgids_next() function iterates over pointers into the tgid_map
    array & dereferences the pointers which results in the tgid, but then it
    passes that dereferenced value to trace_find_tgid() which treats it as a
    pid & does a further lookup within the tgid_map array. It seems likely
    that the intent here was to skip over entries in tgid_map for which the
    recorded tgid is zero, but instead we end up skipping over entries for
    which the thread group leader hasn't yet had its own tgid recorded in
    tgid_map.
    
    A minimal fix would be to remove the call to trace_find_tgid, turning:
    
      if (trace_find_tgid(*ptr))
    
    into:
    
      if (*ptr)
    
    ..but it seems like this logic can be much simpler if we simply let
    seq_read() iterate over the whole tgid_map array & filter out empty
    entries by returning SEQ_SKIP from saved_tgids_show(). Here we take that
    approach, removing the incorrect logic here entirely.

    rq-qos: fix missed wake-ups in rq_qos_throttle try two
    
    commit 11c7aa0ddea8611007768d3e6b58d45dc60a19e1 upstream.
    
    Commit 545fbd0775ba ("rq-qos: fix missed wake-ups in rq_qos_throttle")
    tried to fix a problem that a process could be sleeping in rq_qos_wait()
    without anyone to wake it up. However the fix is not complete and the
    following can still happen:
    
    CPU1 (waiter1)          CPU2 (waiter2)          CPU3 (waker)
    rq_qos_wait()           rq_qos_wait()
      acquire_inflight_cb() -> fails
                              acquire_inflight_cb() -> fails
    
                                                    completes IOs, inflight
                                                      decreased
      prepare_to_wait_exclusive()
                              prepare_to_wait_exclusive()
      has_sleeper = !wq_has_single_sleeper() -> true as there are two sleepers
                              has_sleeper = !wq_has_single_sleeper() -> true
      io_schedule()           io_schedule()
    
    Deadlock as now there's nobody to wakeup the two waiters. The logic
    automatically blocking when there are already sleepers is really subtle
    and the only way to make it work reliably is that we check whether there
    are some waiters in the queue when adding ourselves there. That way, we
    are guaranteed that at least the first process to enter the wait queue
    will recheck the waiting condition before going to sleep and thus
    guarantee forward progress.

    commit d3b16034a24a112bb83aeb669ac5b9b01f744bb7 upstream.
    
    There's two variables being increased in that loop (i and j), and i
    follows the raw data, and j follows what is being written into the buffer.
    We should compare 'i' to MAX_MEMHEX_BYTES or compare 'j' to HEX_CHARS.
    Otherwise, if 'j' goes bigger than HEX_CHARS, it will overflow the
    destination buffer.

    mfd: syscon: Free the allocated name field of struct regmap_config

    The commit 529a1101212a("mfd: syscon: Don't free allocated name

    for debugfs init delays") fixing this debugfs init issue from root
    cause. With this fixing, the name field in struct regmap_debugfs_node
    is removed. When initialize debugfs for syscon driver, the name
    field of struct regmap_config is not used anymore. So, the allocated
    name field of struct regmap_config is need to be freed directly after
    regmap initialization to avoid memory leak.

    ipmi/watchdog: Stop watchdog timer when the current action is 'none'
    
    commit 2253042d86f57d90a621ac2513a7a7a13afcf809 upstream.
    
    When an IPMI watchdog timer is being stopped in ipmi_close() or
    ipmi_ioctl(WDIOS_DISABLECARD), the current watchdog action is updated to
    WDOG_TIMEOUT_NONE and _ipmi_set_timeout(IPMI_SET_TIMEOUT_NO_HB) is called
    to install this action. The latter function ends up invoking
    __ipmi_set_timeout() which makes the actual 'Set Watchdog Timer' IPMI
    request.
    
    For IPMI 1.0, this operation results in fully stopping the watchdog timer.
    For IPMI >= 1.5, function __ipmi_set_timeout() always specifies the "don't
    stop" flag in the prepared 'Set Watchdog Timer' IPMI request. This causes
    that the watchdog timer has its action correctly updated to 'none' but the
    timer continues to run. A problem is that IPMI firmware can then still log
    an expiration event when the configured timeout is reached, which is
    unexpected because the watchdog timer was requested to be stopped.
    
    The patch fixes this problem by not setting the "don't stop" flag in
    __ipmi_set_timeout() when the current action is WDOG_TIMEOUT_NONE which
    results in stopping the watchdog timer. This makes the behaviour for
    IPMI >= 1.5 consistent with IPMI 1.0. It also matches the logic in
    __ipmi_heartbeat() which does not allow to reset the watchdog if the
    current action is WDOG_TIMEOUT_NONE as that would start the timer.

    qemu_fw_cfg: Make fw_cfg_rev_attr a proper kobj_attribute
    
    commit fca41af18e10318e4de090db47d9fa7169e1bf2f upstream.
    
    fw_cfg_showrev() is called by an indirect call in kobj_attr_show(),
    which violates clang's CFI checking because fw_cfg_showrev()'s second
    parameter is 'struct attribute', whereas the ->show() member of 'struct
    kobj_structure' expects the second parameter to be of type 'struct
    kobj_attribute'.
    
    $ cat /sys/firmware/qemu_fw_cfg/rev

    $ dmesg | grep "CFI failure"
    [   26.016832] CFI failure (target: fw_cfg_showrev+0x0/0x8):
    
    Fix this by converting fw_cfg_rev_attr to 'struct kobj_attribute' where
    this would have been caught automatically by the incompatible pointer
    types compiler warning. Update fw_cfg_showrev() accordingly.

    mwifiex: bring down link before deleting interface
    
    commit 1f9482aa8d412b4ba06ce6ab8e333fb8ca29a06e upstream.
    
    We can deadlock when rmmod'ing the driver or going through firmware
    reset, because the cfg80211_unregister_wdev() has to bring down the link
    for us, ... which then grab the same wiphy lock.
    
    nl80211_del_interface() already handles a very similar case, with a nice
    description:
    
            /*
             * We hold RTNL, so this is safe, without RTNL opencount cannot
             * reach 0, and thus the rdev cannot be deleted.
             *
             * We need to do it for the dev_close(), since that will call
             * the netdev notifiers, and we need to acquire the mutex there
             * but don't know if we get there from here or from some other
             * place (e.g. "ip link set ... down").
             */
            mutex_unlock(&rdev->wiphy.mtx);
    ...
    
    Do similarly for mwifiex teardown, by ensuring we bring the link down
    first.
    
    Sample deadlock trace:

    ASoC: tegra: Set driver_name=tegra for all machine drivers
    
    commit f6eb84fa596abf28959fc7e0b626f925eb1196c7 upstream.
    
    The driver_name="tegra" is now required by the newer ALSA UCMs, otherwise
    Tegra UCMs don't match by the path/name.
    
    All Tegra machine drivers are specifying the card's name, but it has no
    effect if model name is specified in the device-tree since it overrides
    the card's name. We need to set the driver_name to "tegra" in order to
    get a usable lookup path for the updated ALSA UCMs. The new UCM lookup
    path has a form of driver_name/card_name.
    
    The old lookup paths that are based on driver module name continue to
    work as before. Note that UCM matching never worked for Tegra ASoC drivers
    if they were compiled as built-in, this is fixed by supporting the new
    naming scheme.

    clocksource/arm_arch_timer: Improve Allwinner A64 timer workaround
    
    commit 8b33dfe0ba1c84c1aab2456590b38195837f1e6e upstream.
    
    Bad counter reads are experienced sometimes when bit 10 or greater rolls
    over. Originally, testing showed that at least 10 lower bits would be
    set to the same value during these bad reads. However, some users still
    reported time skips.
    
    Wider testing revealed that on some chips, occasionally only the lowest
    9 bits would read as the anomalous value. During these reads (which
    still happen only when bit 10), bit 9 would read as the correct value.
    
    Reduce the mask by one bit to cover these cases as well.

    cpu/hotplug: Cure the cpusets trainwreck
    
    commit b22afcdf04c96ca58327784e280e10288cfd3303 upstream.
    
    Alexey and Joshua tried to solve a cpusets related hotplug problem which is
    user space visible and results in unexpected behaviour for some time after
    a CPU has been plugged in and the corresponding uevent was delivered.
    
    cpusets delegate the hotplug work (rebuilding cpumasks etc.) to a
    workqueue. This is done because the cpusets code has already a lock
    nesting of cgroups_mutex -> cpu_hotplug_lock. A synchronous callback or
    waiting for the work to finish with cpu_hotplug_lock held can and will
    deadlock because that results in the reverse lock order.
    
    As a consequence the uevent can be delivered before cpusets have consistent
    state which means that a user space invocation of sched_setaffinity() to
    move a task to the plugged CPU fails up to the point where the scheduled
    work has been processed.
    
    The same is true for CPU unplug, but that does not create user observable
    failure (yet).
    
    It's still inconsistent to claim that an operation is finished before it
    actually is and that's the real issue at hand. uevents just make it
    reliably observable.
    
    Obviously the problem should be fixed in cpusets/cgroups, but untangling
    that is pretty much impossible because according to the changelog of the
    commit which introduced this 8 years ago:
    
     3a5a6d0c2b03("cpuset: don't nest cgroup_mutex inside get_online_cpus()")
    
    the lock order cgroups_mutex -> cpu_hotplug_lock is a design decision and
    the whole code is built around that.
    
    So bite the bullet and invoke the relevant cpuset function, which waits for
    the work to finish, in _cpu_up/down() after dropping cpu_hotplug_lock and
    only when tasks are not frozen by suspend/hibernate because that would
    obviously wait forever.
    
    Waiting there with cpu_add_remove_lock, which is protecting the present
    and possible CPU maps, held is not a problem at all because neither work
    queues nor cpusets/cgroups have any lockchains related to that lock.
    
    Waiting in the hotplug machinery is not problematic either because there
    are already state callbacks which wait for hardware queues to drain. It
    makes the operations slightly slower, but hotplug is slow anyway.
    
    This ensures that state is consistent before returning from a hotplug
    up/down operation. It's still inconsistent during the operation, but that's
    a different story.
    
    Add a large comment which explains why this is done and why this is not a
    dump ground for the hack of the day to work around half thought out locking
    schemes. Document also the implications vs. hotplug operations and
    serialization or the lack of it.
    
    Thanks to Alexy and Joshua for analyzing why this temporary
    sched_setaffinity() failure happened.

    arm64: tlb: fix the TTL value of tlb_get_level
    
    commit 52218fcd61cb42bde0d301db4acb3ffdf3463cc7 upstream.
    
    The TTL field indicates the level of page table walk holding the *leaf*
    entry for the address being invalidated. But currently, the TTL field
    may be set to an incorrent value in the following stack:
    
    pte_free_tlb
        __pte_free_tlb
            tlb_remove_table
                tlb_table_invalidate
                    tlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly
                        tlb_flush
    
    In this case, we just want to flush a PTE page, but the tlb->cleared_pmds
    is set and we get tlb_level = 2 in the tlb_get_level() function. This may
    cause some unexpected problems.
    
    This patch set the TTL field to 0 if tlb->freed_tables is set. The
    tlb->freed_tables indicates page table pages are freed, not the leaf
    entry.

    ata: ahci_sunxi: Disable DIPM
    
    commit f6bca4d91b2ea052e917cca3f9d866b5cc1d500a upstream.
    
    DIPM is unsupported or broken on sunxi. Trying to enable the power
    management policy med_power_with_dipm on an Allwinner A20 SoC based board
    leads to immediate I/O errors and the attached SATA disk disappears from
    the /dev filesystem. A reset (power cycle) is required to make the SATA
    controller or disk work again. The A10 and A20 SoC data sheets and manuals
    don't mention DIPM at all [1], so it's fair to assume that it's simply not
    supported. But even if it was, it should be considered broken and best be
    disabled in the ahci_sunxi driver.

    mmc: core: Allow UHS-I voltage switch for SDSC cards if supported
    
    commit 09247e110b2efce3a104e57e887c373e0a57a412 upstream.
    
    While initializing an UHS-I SD card, the mmc core first tries to switch to
    1.8V I/O voltage, before it continues to change the settings for the bus
    speed mode.
    
    However, the current behaviour in the mmc core is inconsistent and doesn't
    conform to the SD spec. More precisely, an SD card that supports UHS-I must
    set both the SD_OCR_CCS bit and the SD_OCR_S18R bit in the OCR register
    response. When switching to 1.8V I/O the mmc core correctly checks both of
    the bits, but only the SD_OCR_S18R bit when changing the settings for bus
    speed mode.
    
    Rather than actually fixing the code to confirm to the SD spec, let's
    deliberately deviate from it by requiring only the SD_OCR_S18R bit for both
    parts. This enables us to support UHS-I for SDSC cards (outside spec),
    which is actually being supported by some existing SDSC cards. Moreover,
    this fixes the inconsistent behaviour.

    mmc: core: clear flags before allowing to retune
    
    commit 77347eda64ed5c9383961d1de9165f9d0b7d8df6 upstream.
    
    It might be that something goes wrong during tuning so the MMC core will
    immediately trigger a retune. In our case it was:
    
     - we sent a tuning block
     - there was an error so we need to send an abort cmd to the eMMC
     - the abort cmd had a CRC error
     - retune was set by the MMC core
    
    This lead to a vicious circle causing a performance regression of 75%.
    So, clear retuning flags before we enable retuning to start with a known
    cleared state.

    mmc: sdhci: Fix warning message when accessing RPMB in HS400 mode
    
    commit d0244847f9fc5e20df8b7483c8a4717fe0432d38 upstream.
    
    When an eMMC device is being run in HS400 mode, any access to the
    RPMB device will cause the error message "mmc1: Invalid UHS-I mode
    selected". This happens as a result of tuning being disabled before
    RPMB access and then re-enabled after the RPMB access is complete.
    When tuning is re-enabled, the system has to switch from HS400
    to HS200 to do the tuning and then back to HS400. As part of
    sequence to switch from HS400 to HS200 the system is temporarily
    put into HS mode. When switching to HS mode, sdhci_get_preset_value()
    is called and does not have support for HS mode and prints the warning
    message and returns the preset for SDR12. The fix is to add support
    for MMC and SD HS modes to sdhci_get_preset_value().
    
    This can be reproduced on any system running eMMC in HS400 mode
    (not HS400ES) by using the "mmc" utility to run the following
    command: "mmc rpmb read-counter /dev/mmcblk0rpmb".

    commit 94ee6782e045645abd9180ab9369b01293d862bd upstream.
    
    On the Toshiba Encore 2 WT8-B the  microSD slot always reports the card
    being write-protected even though microSD cards do not have a write-protect
    switch at all.
    
    Add a new DMI_QUIRK_SD_NO_WRITE_PROTECT quirk entry to sdhci-acpi.c's

    drm/ingenic: Fix pixclock rate for 24-bit serial panels

    When using a 24-bit panel on a 8-bit serial bus, the pixel clock
    requested by the panel has to be multiplied by 3, since the subpixels
    are shifted sequentially.
    
    The code (in ingenic_drm_encoder_atomic_check) already computed
    crtc_state->adjusted_mode->crtc_clock accordingly, but clk_set_rate()
    used crtc_state->adjusted_mode->clock instead.

    drm/amd/display: Reject non-zero src_y and src_x for video planes
    
    commit c6c6a712199ab355ce333fa5764a59506bb107c1 upstream.
    
    [Why]
    This hasn't been well tested and leads to complete system hangs on DCN1
    based systems, possibly others.
    
    The system hang can be reproduced by gesturing the video on the YouTube
    Android app on ChromeOS into full screen.
    
    [How]
    Reject atomic commits with non-zero drm_plane_state.src_x or src_y values.
    
    v2:
     - Add code comment describing the reason we're rejecting non-zero
       src_x and src_y
     - Drop gerrit Change-Id
     - Add stable CC
     - Based on amd-staging-drm-next
    
    v3: removed trailing whitespace

    drm/rockchip: dsi: remove extra component_del() call
    
    commit b354498bbe65c917d521b3b56317ddc9ab217425 upstream.
    
    commit cf6d100dd238 ("drm/rockchip: dsi: add dual mipi support") added
    this devcnt field and call to component_del(). However, these both
    appear to be erroneous changes left over from an earlier version of the
    patch. In the version merged, nothing ever modifies devcnt, meaning
    component_del() runs unconditionally and in addition to the
    component_del() calls in dw_mipi_dsi_rockchip_host_detach(). The second
    call fails to delete anything and produces a warning in dmesg.
    
    If we look at the previous version of the patch[1], however, we see that
    it had logic to calculate devcnt and call component_add() in certain
    situations. This was removed in v6, and the fact that the deletion code
    was not appears to have been an oversight.

    drm/dp: Handle zeroed port counts in drm_dp_read_downstream_info()
    
    commit 205bb69a90363541a634a662a599fddb95956524 upstream.
    
    While the DP specification isn't entirely clear on if this should be
    allowed or not, some branch devices report having downstream ports present
    while also reporting a downstream port count of 0. So to avoid breaking
    those devices, we need to handle this in drm_dp_read_downstream_info().
    
    So, to do this we assume there's no downstream port info when the
    downstream port count is 0.

    unbalanced clk_disable call at boot since we never enabled them in the

    drm/vc4: crtc: Skip the TXP
    
    commit 47a50743031ad4138050ae6d266ddd3dfe845ead upstream.
    
    The vc4_set_crtc_possible_masks is meant to run over all the encoders
    and then set their possible_crtcs mask to their associated pixelvalve.
    
    However, since the commit 39fcb2808376 ("drm/vc4: txp: Turn the TXP into
    a CRTC of its own"), the TXP has been turned to a CRTC and encoder of
    its own, and while it does indeed register an encoder, it no longer has
    an associated pixelvalve. The code will thus run over the TXP encoder
    and set a bogus possible_crtcs mask, overriding the one set in the TXP
    bind function.
    
    In order to fix this, let's skip any virtual encoder.

    The current code does a binary OR on the possible_crtcs variable of the
    TXP encoder, while we want to set it to that value instead.

    drm/radeon: Call radeon_suspend_kms() in radeon_pci_shutdown() for Loongson64
    
    commit c1bfd74bfef77bcefc88d12eaf8996c0dfd51331 upstream.
    
    On the Loongson64 platform used with Radeon GPU, shutdown or reboot failed
    when console=tty is in the boot cmdline.
    
    radeon_suspend_kms() puts the hw in the suspend state, especially set fb
    state as FBINFO_STATE_SUSPENDED:
    
            if (fbcon) {
                    console_lock();
                    radeon_fbdev_set_suspend(rdev, 1);
                    console_unlock();
            }
    
    Then avoid to do any more fb operations in the related functions:
    
            if (p->state != FBINFO_STATE_RUNNING)
                    return;
    
    So call radeon_suspend_kms() in radeon_pci_shutdown() for Loongson64 to fix
    this issue, it looks like some kind of workaround like powerpc.

    SMU had set all the necessary fields for a link width switch
    but the width switch wasn't occurring because the link was idle
    in the L1 state. Setting LC_L1_RECONFIG_EN=0x1 will allow width
    switches to also be initiated while in L1 instead of waiting until
    the link is back in L0.

    powerpc/powernv/vas: Release reference to tgid during window close
    
    commit 91cdbb955aa94ee0841af4685be40937345d29b8 upstream.
    
    The kernel handles the NX fault by updating CSB or sending
    signal to process. In multithread applications, children can
    open VAS windows and can exit without closing them. But the
    parent can continue to send NX requests with these windows. To
    prevent pid reuse, reference will be taken on pid and tgid
    when the window is opened and release them during window close.
    
    The current code is not releasing the tgid reference which can
    cause pid leak and this patch fixes the issue.

    powerpc/barrier: Avoid collision with clang's __lwsync macro
    
    commit 015d98149b326e0f1f02e44413112ca8b4330543 upstream.
    
    A change in clang 13 results in the __lwsync macro being defined as
    __builtin_ppc_lwsync, which emits 'lwsync' or 'msync' depending on what
    the target supports. This breaks the build because of -Werror in
    arch/powerpc, along with thousands of warnings:

    Undefine this macro so that the runtime patching introduced by
    commit 2d1b2027626d ("powerpc: Fixup lwsync at runtime") continues to
    work properly with clang and the build no longer breaks.

    powerpc/mm: Fix lockup on kernel exec fault
    
    commit cd5d5e602f502895e47e18cd46804d6d7014e65c upstream.
    
    The powerpc kernel is not prepared to handle exec faults from kernel.
    Especially, the function is_exec_fault() will return 'false' when an
    exec fault is taken by kernel, because the check is based on reading
    current->thread.regs->trap which contains the trap from user.
    
    For instance, when provoking a LKDTM EXEC_USERSPACE test,
    current->thread.regs->trap is set to SYSCALL trap (0xc00), and
    the fault taken by the kernel is not seen as an exec fault by
    set_access_flags_filter().
    
    Commit d7df2443cd5f ("powerpc/mm: Fix spurious segfaults on radix
    with autonuma") made it clear and handled it properly. But later on
    commit d3ca587404b3 ("powerpc/mm: Fix reporting of kernel execute
    faults") removed that handling, introducing test based on error_code.
    And here is the problem, because on the 603 all upper bits of SRR1
    get cleared when the TLB instruction miss handler bails out to ISI.
    
    Until commit cbd7e6ca0210 ("powerpc/fault: Avoid heavy
    search_exception_tables() verification"), an exec fault from kernel
    at a userspace address was indirectly caught by the lack of entry for
    that address in the exception tables. But after that commit the
    kernel mainly relies on KUAP or on core mm handling to catch wrong
    user accesses. Here the access is not wrong, so mm handles it.
    It is a minor fault because PAGE_EXEC is not set,
    set_access_flags_filter() should set PAGE_EXEC and voila.
    But as is_exec_fault() returns false as explained in the beginning,
    set_access_flags_filter() bails out without setting PAGE_EXEC flag,
    which leads to a forever minor exec fault.
    
    As the kernel is not prepared to handle such exec faults, the thing to
    do is to fire in bad_kernel_fault() for any exec fault taken by the
    kernel, as it was prior to commit d3ca587404b3.

    mm/mremap: hold the rmap lock in write mode when moving page table entries.
    
    commit 97113eb39fa7972722ff490b947d8af023e1f6a2 upstream.
    
    To avoid a race between rmap walk and mremap, mremap does
    take_rmap_locks().  The lock was taken to ensure that rmap walk don't miss
    a page table entry due to PTE moves via move_pagetables().  The kernel
    does further optimization of this lock such that if we are going to find
    the newly added vma after the old vma, the rmap lock is not taken.  This
    is because rmap walk would find the vmas in the same order and if we don't
    find the page table attached to older vma we would find it with the new
    vma which we would iterate later.
    
    As explained in commit eb66ae030829 ("mremap: properly flush TLB before
    releasing the page") mremap is special in that it doesn't take ownership
    of the page.  The optimized version for PUD/PMD aligned mremap also
    doesn't hold the ptl lock.  This can result in stale TLB entries as show
    below.
    
    This patch updates the rmap locking requirement in mremap to handle the race condition
    explained below with optimized mremap::
    
    Optmized PMD move
    
        CPU 1                           CPU 2                                   CPU 3
    
        mremap(old_addr, new_addr)      page_shrinker/try_to_unmap_one
    
        mmap_write_lock_killable()
    
                                        addr = old_addr
                                        lock(pte_ptl)
        lock(pmd_ptl)
        pmd = *old_pmd
        pmd_clear(old_pmd)
        flush_tlb_range(old_addr)
    
        *new_pmd = pmd
                                                                                *new_addr = 10; and fills
                                                                                TLB with new addr
                                                                                and old pfn
    
        unlock(pmd_ptl)
                                        ptep_clear_flush()
                                        old pfn is free.
                                                                                Stale TLB entry
    
    Optimized PUD move also suffers from a similar race.  Both the above race
    condition can be fixed if we force mremap path to take rmap lock.

    MIPS: MT extensions are not available on MIPS32r1
    
    commit cad065ed8d8831df67b9754cc4437ed55d8b48c0 upstream.
    
    MIPS MT extensions were added with the MIPS 34K processor, which was
    based on the MIPS32r2 ISA.
    
    This fixes a build error when building a generic kernel for a MIPS32r1
    CPU.

    Commit 275e88b06a27 ("PCI: tegra: Fix host link initialization") broke
    host initialization during resume as it misses out calling the API
    dw_pcie_setup_rc() which is required for host and MSI initialization.

    MIPS: loongsoon64: Reserve memory below starting pfn to prevent Oops
    
    [ Upstream commit 6817c944430d00f71ccaa9c99ff5b0096aeb7873 ]
    
    The cause of the problem is as follows:
    1. when cat /sys/devices/system/memory/memory0/valid_zones,
       test_pages_in_a_zone() will be called.
    2. test_pages_in_a_zone() finds the zone according to stat_pfn = 0.
       The smallest pfn of the numa node in the mips architecture is 128,
       and the page corresponding to the previous 0~127 pfn is not
       initialized (page->flags is 0xFFFFFFFF)
    3. The nid and zonenum obtained using page_zone(pfn_to_page(0)) are out
       of bounds in the corresponding array,
       &NODE_DATA(page_to_nid(page))->node_zones[page_zonenum(page)],
       access to the out-of-bounds zone member variables appear abnormal,
       resulting in Oops.
    Therefore, it is necessary to keep the page between 0 and the minimum
    pfn to prevent Oops from appearing.

    sctp: add size validation when walking chunks
    
    [ Upstream commit 50619dbf8db77e98d821d615af4f634d08e22698 ]
    
    The first chunk in a packet is ensured to be present at the beginning of
    sctp_rcv(), as a packet needs to have at least 1 chunk. But the second
    one, may not be completely available and ch->length can be over
    uninitialized memory.
    
    Fix here is by only trying to walk on the next chunk if there is enough to
    hold at least the header, and then proceed with the ch->length validation
    that is already there.

    sctp: validate from_addr_param return
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c5dc070ff3d6246d22ddd931f23a6266249e3db ]
    
    Ilja reported that, simply putting it, nothing was validating that
    from_addr_param functions were operating on initialized memory. That is,
    the parameter itself was being validated by sctp_walk_params, but it
    doesn't check for types and their specific sizes and it could be a 0-length
    one, causing from_addr_param to potentially work over the next parameter or
    even uninitialized memory.
    
    The fix here is to, in all calls to from_addr_param, check if enough space
    is there for the wanted IP address type.

    bpf: Fix false positive kmemleak report in bpf_ringbuf_area_alloc()
    
    [ Upstream commit ccff81e1d028bbbf8573d3364a87542386c707bf ]
    
    kmemleak scans struct page, but it does not scan the page content. If we
    allocate some memory with kmalloc(), then allocate page with alloc_page(),
    and if we put kmalloc pointer somewhere inside that page, kmemleak will
    report kmalloc pointer as a false positive.
    
    We can instruct kmemleak to scan the memory area by calling kmemleak_alloc()
    and kmemleak_free(), but part of struct bpf_ringbuf is mmaped to user space,
    and if struct bpf_ringbuf changes we would have to revisit and review size
    argument in kmemleak_alloc(), because we do not want kmemleak to scan the
    user space memory. Let's simplify things and use kmemleak_not_leak() here.
    
    For posterity, also adding additional prior analysis from Andrii:
    
      I think either kmemleak or syzbot are misreporting this. I've added a
      bunch of printks around all allocations performed by BPF ringbuf. [...]
      On repro side I get these two warnings:
    
      [vmuser@archvm bpf]$ sudo ./repro

      Note that both reported leaks (ffff88810d538c80 and ffff88810d538c00)
      correspond to pages array bpf_ringbuf is allocating and tracking properly
      internally. Note also that syzbot repro doesn't close FD of created BPF
      ringbufs, and even when ./repro itself exits with error, there are still
      two forked processes hanging around in my system. So clearly ringbuf maps
      are alive at that point. So reporting any memory leak looks weird at that
      point, because that memory is being used by active referenced BPF ringbuf.
    
      It's also a question why repro doesn't clean up its forks. But if I do a
      `pkill repro`, I do see that all the allocated memory is /properly/ cleaned
      up [and the] "leaks" are deallocated properly.
    
      BTW, if I add close() right after bpf() syscall in syzbot repro, I see that
      everything is immediately deallocated, like designed. And no memory leak
      is reported. So I don't think the problem is anywhere in bpf_ringbuf code,
      rather in the leak detection and/or repro itself.

    sched/fair: Ensure _sum and _avg values stay consistent
    
    [ Upstream commit 1c35b07e6d3986474e5635be566e7bc79d97c64d ]
    
    The _sum and _avg values are in general sync together with the PELT
    divider. They are however not always completely in perfect sync,
    resulting in situations where _sum gets to zero while _avg stays
    positive. Such situations are undesirable.
    
    This comes from the fact that PELT will increase period_contrib, also
    increasing the PELT divider, without updating _sum and _avg values to
    stay in perfect sync where (_sum == _avg * divider). However, such PELT
    change will never lower _sum, making it impossible to end up in a
    situation where _sum is zero and _avg is not.
    
    Therefore, we need to ensure that when subtracting load outside PELT,
    that when _sum is zero, _avg is also set to zero. This occurs when
    (_sum < _avg * divider), and the subtracted (_avg * divider) is bigger
    or equal to the current _sum, while the subtracted _avg is smaller than
    the current _avg.

    0a03f98b98c201191e3ba15a0e33f46d8660e1fd
    ("Bluetooth: Add a new 04ca:3015 QCA_ROME device").
    
    Without this patch, the WiFi side of the QCA9377 board is slow or unusable
    when the Bluetooth side is in use.
    
    See https://askubuntu.com/a/1137852 for another report of QCA_ROME fixing
    this issue for this device ID.

    So move the shutdown callback to a place where workqueues are either
    flushed or cancelled to resolve the issue.

    Bluetooth: Fix alt settings for incoming SCO with transparent coding format
    
    [ Upstream commit 06d213d8a89a6f55b708422c3dda2b22add10748 ]
    
    For incoming SCO connection with transparent coding format, alt setting
    of CVSD is getting applied instead of Transparent.

    0x2B, 0x31 and 0x33 are reserved for future use but were not present in
    the HCI to MGMT conversion table, this caused the conversion to be
    incorrect for the HCI status code greater than 0x2A.

    Bluetooth: cmtp: fix file refcount when cmtp_attach_device fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 3cfdf8fcaafa62a4123f92eb0f4a72650da3a479 ]
    
    When cmtp_attach_device fails, cmtp_add_connection returns the error value
    which leads to the caller to doing fput through sockfd_put. But
    cmtp_session kthread, which is stopped in this path will also call fput,
    leading to a potential refcount underflow or a use-after-free.
    
    Add a refcount before we signal the kthread to stop. The kthread will try
    to grab the cmtp_session_sem mutex before doing the fput, which is held
    when get_file is called, so there should be no races there.

    net: ip: avoid OOM kills with large UDP sends over loopback
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d123b81ac615072a8525c13c6c41b695270a15d ]
    
    Dave observed number of machines hitting OOM on the UDP send
    path. The workload seems to be sending large UDP packets over
    loopback. Since loopback has MTU of 64k kernel will try to
    allocate an skb with up to 64k of head space. This has a good
    chance of failing under memory pressure. What's worse if
    the message length is <32k the allocation may trigger an
    OOM killer.
    
    This is entirely avoidable, we can use an skb with page frags.
    
    af_unix solves a similar problem by limiting the head
    length to SKB_MAX_ALLOC. This seems like a good and simple
    approach. It means that UDP messages > 16kB will now
    use fragments if underlying device supports SG, if extra
    allocator pressure causes regressions in real workloads
    we can switch to trying the large allocation first and
    falling back.

    net: retrieve netns cookie via getsocketopt
    
    [ Upstream commit e8b9eab99232c4e62ada9d7976c80fd5e8118289 ]
    
    It's getting more common to run nested container environments for
    testing cloud software. One of such examples is Kind [1] which runs a
    Kubernetes cluster in Docker containers on a single host. Each container
    acts as a Kubernetes node, and thus can run any Pod (aka container)
    inside the former. This approach simplifies testing a lot, as it
    eliminates complicated VM setups.
    
    Unfortunately, such a setup breaks some functionality when cgroupv2 BPF
    programs are used for load-balancing. The load-balancer BPF program
    needs to detect whether a request originates from the host netns or a
    container netns in order to allow some access, e.g. to a service via a
    loopback IP address. Typically, the programs detect this by comparing
    netns cookies with the one of the init ns via a call to
    bpf_get_netns_cookie(NULL). However, in nested environments the latter
    cannot be used given the Kubernetes node's netns is outside the init ns.
    To fix this, we need to pass the Kubernetes node netns cookie to the
    program in a different way: by extending getsockopt() with a
    SO_NETNS_COOKIE option, the orchestrator which runs in the Kubernetes
    node netns can retrieve the cookie and pass it to the program instead.
    
    Thus, this is following up on Eric's commit 3d368ab87cf6 ("net:
    initialize net->net_cookie at netns setup") to allow retrieval via
    SO_NETNS_COOKIE.  This is also in line in how we retrieve socket cookie
    via SO_COOKIE.

    media, bpf: Do not copy more entries than user space requested
    
    [ Upstream commit 647d446d66e493d23ca1047fa8492b0269674530 ]
    
    The syscall bpf(BPF_PROG_QUERY, &attr) should use the prog_cnt field to
    see how many entries user space provided and return ENOSPC if there are
    more programs than that. Before this patch, this is not checked and
    ENOSPC is never returned.
    
    Note that one lirc device is limited to 64 bpf programs, and user space
    I'm aware of -- ir-keytable -- always gives enough space for 64 entries
    already. However, we should not copy program ids than are requested.

    mac80211: Properly WARN on HW scan before restart
    
    [ Upstream commit 45daaa1318410794de956fb8e9d06aed2dbb23d0 ]
    
    The following race was possible:
    
    1. The device driver requests HW restart.
    2. A scan is requested from user space and is propagated
       to the driver. During this flow HW_SCANNING flag is set.
    3. The thread that handles the HW restart is scheduled,
       and before starting the actual reconfiguration it
       checks that HW_SCANNING is not set. The flow does so
       without acquiring any lock, and thus the WARN fires.
    
    Fix this by checking that HW_SCANNING is on only after RTNL is
    acquired, i.e., user space scan request handling is no longer
    in transit.

    mac80211: consider per-CPU statistics if present
    
    [ Upstream commit d656a4c6ead6c3f252b2f2532bc9735598f7e317 ]
    
    If we have been keeping per-CPU statistics, consider them
    regardless of USES_RSS, because we may not actually fill
    those, for example in non-fast-RX cases when the connection
    is not compatible with fast-RX. If we didn't fill them, the
    additional data will be zero and not affect anything, and
    if we did fill them then it's more correct to consider them.
    
    This fixes an issue in mesh mode where some statistics are
    not updated due to USES_RSS being set, but fast-RX isn't
    used.

    wireless: wext-spy: Fix out-of-bounds warning
    
    [ Upstream commit e93bdd78406da9ed01554c51e38b2a02c8ef8025 ]
    
    Fix the following out-of-bounds warning:
    
    net/wireless/wext-spy.c:178:2: warning: 'memcpy' offset [25, 28] from the object at 'threshold' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'low' with type 'struct iw_quality' at offset 20 [-Warray-bounds]
    
    The problem is that the original code is trying to copy data into a
    couple of struct members adjacent to each other in a single call to
    memcpy(). This causes a legitimate compiler warning because memcpy()
    overruns the length of &threshold.low and &spydata->spy_thr_low. As
    these are just a couple of struct members, fix this by using direct
    assignments, instead of memcpy().
    
    This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
    and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
    on memcpy().

    sfc: error code if SRIOV cannot be disabled
    
    [ Upstream commit 1ebe4feb8b442884f5a28d2437040096723dd1ea ]
    
    If SRIOV cannot be disabled during device removal or module unloading,
    return error code so it can be logged properly in the calling function.
    
    Note that this can only happen if any VF is currently attached to a
    guest using Xen, but not with vfio/KVM. Despite that in that case the
    VFs won't work properly with PF removed and/or the module unloaded, I
    have let it as is because I don't know what side effects may have
    changing it, and also it seems to be the same that other drivers are
    doing in this situation.
    
    In the case of being called during SRIOV reconfiguration, the behavior
    hasn't changed because the function is called with force=false.

    sfc: avoid double pci_remove of VFs
    
    [ Upstream commit 45423cff1db66cf0993e8a9bd0ac93e740149e49 ]
    
    If pci_remove was called for a PF with VFs, the removal of the VFs was
    called twice from efx_ef10_sriov_fini: one directly with pci_driver->remove
    and another implicit by calling pci_disable_sriov, which also perform
    the VFs remove. This was leading to crashing the kernel on the second
    attempt.
    
    Given that pci_disable_sriov already calls to pci remove function, get
    rid of the direct call to pci_driver->remove from the driver.
    
    2 different ways to trigger the bug:
    - Create one or more VFs, then attach the PF to a virtual machine (at
      least with qemu/KVM)
    - Create one or more VFs, then remove the PF with:
      echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/PF_PCI_ID/remove
    
    Removing sfc module does not trigger the error, at least for me, because
    it removes the VF first, and then the PF.
    
    Example of a log with the error:
        list_del corruption, ffff967fd20a8ad0->next is LIST_POISON1 (dead000000000100)

    iwlwifi: pcie: fix context info freeing
    
    [ Upstream commit 26d18c75a7496c4c52b0b6789e713dc76ebfbc87 ]
    
    After firmware alive, iwl_trans_pcie_gen2_fw_alive() is called
    to free the context info. However, on gen3 that will then free
    the context info with the wrong size.
    
    Since we free this allocation later, let it stick around until
    the device is stopped for now, freeing some of it earlier is a
    separate change.

    When the session protection ends and the Driver is not

    prints "No beacons heard...".
    That's confusing for the case where not associated.

    iwlwifi: mvm: apply RX diversity per PHY context
    
    [ Upstream commit a171399fd687a7d2fa56a10c9a2d7084a647677d ]
    
    SMPS requests may differ per interfaces due to e.g. Bluetooth
    only interfering on 2.4 GHz, so if that's the case we should,
    in the case of multiple PHY contexts, still allow RX diversity
    on PHY context that have no interfaces with SMPS requests.
    
    Fix the code to pass through the PHY context in question and
    skip interfaces with non-matching PHY context while iterating.

    iwlwifi: mvm: don't change band on bound PHY contexts
    
    [ Upstream commit 8835a64f74c46baebfc946cd5a2c861b866ebcee ]
    
    When we have a P2P Device active, we attempt to only change the
    PHY context it uses when we get a new remain-on-channel, if the
    P2P Device is the only user of the PHY context.
    
    This is fine if we're switching within a band, but if we're
    switching bands then the switch implies a removal and re-add
    of the PHY context, which isn't permitted by the firmware while
    it's bound to an interface.
    
    Fix the code to skip the unbind/release/... cycle only if the
    band doesn't change (or we have old devices that can switch the
    band on the fly as well.)

    rxe_mr_init_user() always returns the fixed -EINVAL when ib_umem_get()
    fails so it's hard for user to know which actual error happens in
    ib_umem_get(). For example, ib_umem_get() will return -EOPNOTSUPP when
    trying to pin pages on a DAX file.
    
    Return actual error as mlx4/mlx5 does.

    vsock: notify server to shutdown when client has pending signal
    
    [ Upstream commit c7ff9cff70601ea19245d997bb977344663434c7 ]
    
    The client's sk_state will be set to TCP_ESTABLISHED if the server
    replay the client's connect request.
    
    However, if the client has pending signal, its sk_state will be set
    to TCP_CLOSE without notify the server, so the server will hold the
    corrupt connection.
    
                client                        server
    
    1. sk_state=TCP_SYN_SENT         |
    2. call ->connect()              |
    3. wait reply                    |
                                     | 4. sk_state=TCP_ESTABLISHED
                                     | 5. insert to connected list
                                     | 6. reply to the client
    7. sk_state=TCP_ESTABLISHED      |
    8. insert to connected list      |
    9. *signal pending* <--------------------- the user kill client
    10. sk_state=TCP_CLOSE           |
    client is exiting...             |
    11. call ->release()             |
         virtio_transport_close
          if (!(sk->sk_state == TCP_ESTABLISHED ||
                  sk->sk_state == TCP_CLOSING))
                    return true; *return at here, the server cannot notice the connection is corrupt*
    
    So the client should notify the peer in this case.

    Because the error handling is sequential, the application of resources
    should be carried out in the order of error handling, so the operation
    of registering the interrupt handler should be put in front, so as not
    to free the unregistered interrupt handler during error handling.

    atm: nicstar: use 'dma_free_coherent' instead of 'kfree'
    
    [ Upstream commit 6a1e5a4af17e440dd82a58a2c5f40ff17a82b722 ]
    
    When 'nicstar_init_one' fails, 'ns_init_card_error' will be executed for
    error handling, but the correct memory free function should be used,
    otherwise it will cause an error. Since 'card->rsq.org' and
    'card->tsq.org' are allocated using 'dma_alloc_coherent' function, they
    should be freed using 'dma_free_coherent'.
    
    Fix this by using 'dma_free_coherent' instead of 'kfree'
    
    This log reveals it:

    net: fec: add ndo_select_queue to fix TX bandwidth fluctuations
    
    [ Upstream commit 52c4a1a85f4b346c39c896c0168f4a843b3385ff ]
    
    As we know that AVB is enabled by default, and the ENET IP design is
    queue 0 for best effort, queue 1&2 for AVB Class A&B. Bandwidth of each
    queue 1&2 set in driver is 50%, TX bandwidth fluctuated when selecting
    tx queues randomly with FEC_QUIRK_HAS_AVB quirk available.
    
    This patch adds ndo_select_queue callback to select queues for
    transmitting to fix this issue. It will always return queue 0 if this is
    not a vlan packet, and return queue 1 or 2 based on priority of vlan
    packet.
    
    You may complain that in fact we only use single queue for trasmitting
    if we are not targeted to VLAN. Yes, but seems we have no choice, since
    AVB is enabled when the driver probed, we can't switch this feature
    dynamicly. After compare multiple queues to single queue, TX throughput
    almost no improvement.
    
    One way we can implemet is to configure the driver to multiple queues
    with Round-robin scheme by default. Then add ndo_setup_tc callback to
    enable/disable AVB feature for users. Unfortunately, ENET AVB IP seems
    not follow the standard 802.1Qav spec. We only can program
    DMAnCFG[IDLE_SLOPE] field to calculate bandwidth fraction. And idle
    slope is restricted to certain valus (a total of 19). It's far away from
    CBS QDisc implemented in Linux TC framework. If you strongly suggest to do
    this, I think we only can support limited numbers of bandwidth and reject
    others, but it's really urgly and wried.
    
    With this patch, VLAN tagged packets route to queue 0/1/2 based on vlan
    priority; VLAN untagged packets route to queue 0.

    net: fec: add FEC_QUIRK_HAS_MULTI_QUEUES represents i.MX6SX ENET IP
    
    [ Upstream commit 471ff4455d61c9929ae912328859921708e1eafc ]
    
    Frieder Schrempf reported a TX throuthput issue [1], it happens quite often
    that the measured bandwidth in TX direction drops from its expected/nominal
    value to something like ~50% (for 100M) or ~67% (for 1G) connections.
    
    [1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/421cc86c-b66f-b372-32f7-21e59f9a98bc@kontron.de/
    
    The issue becomes clear after digging into it, Net core would select
    queues when transmitting packets. Since FEC have not impletemented
    ndo_select_queue callback yet, so it will call netdev_pick_tx to select
    queues randomly.
    
    For i.MX6SX ENET IP with AVB support, driver default enables this
    feature. According to the setting of QOS/RCMRn/DMAnCFG registers, AVB
    configured to Credit-based scheme, 50% bandwidth of each queue 1&2.
    
    With below tests let me think more:
    1) With FEC_QUIRK_HAS_AVB quirk, can reproduce TX bandwidth fluctuations issue.
    2) Without FEC_QUIRK_HAS_AVB quirk, can't reproduce TX bandwidth fluctuations issue.
    
    The related difference with or w/o FEC_QUIRK_HAS_AVB quirk is that, whether we
    program FTYPE field of TxBD or not. As I describe above, AVB feature is
    enabled by default. With FEC_QUIRK_HAS_AVB quirk, frames in queue 0
    marked as non-AVB, and frames in queue 1&2 marked as AVB Class A&B. It's
    unreasonable if frames in queue 1&2 are not required to be time-sensitive.
    So when Net core select tx queues ramdomly, Credit-based scheme would work
    and lead to TX bandwidth fluctuated. On the other hand, w/o
    FEC_QUIRK_HAS_AVB quirk, frames in queue 1&2 are all marked as non-AVB, so
    Credit-based scheme would not work.
    
    Till now, how can we fix this TX throughput issue? Yes, please remove
    FEC_QUIRK_HAS_AVB quirk if you suffer it from time-nonsensitive networking.
    However, this quirk is used to indicate i.MX6SX, other setting depends
    on it. So this patch adds a new quirk FEC_QUIRK_HAS_MULTI_QUEUES to
    represent i.MX6SX, it is safe for us remove FEC_QUIRK_HAS_AVB quirk
    now.
    
    FEC_QUIRK_HAS_AVB quirk is set by default in the driver, and users may
    not know much about driver details, they would waste effort to find the
    root cause, that is not we want. The following patch is a implementation
    to fix it and users don't need to modify the driver.

    MIPS: add PMD table accounting into MIPS'pmd_alloc_one

    This fixes Page Table accounting bug.
    
    MIPS is the ONLY arch just defining __HAVE_ARCH_PMD_ALLOC_ONE alone.
    Since commit b2b29d6d011944 (mm: account PMD tables like PTE tables),
    "pmd_free" in asm-generic with PMD table accounting and "pmd_alloc_one"
    in MIPS without PMD table accounting causes PageTable accounting number
    negative, which read by global_zone_page_state(), always returns 0.

    mt76: fix iv and CCMP header insertion
    
    [ Upstream commit c368362c36d3d4cedbc9a1c9caa95960912cc429 ]
    
    The iv from RXD is only for TKIP_RSC/CCMP_PN/GCMP_PN, and it needs a
    check for CCMP header insertion. Move mt76_cipher_type to mt76.h to
    reduce duplicated code.

    mt76: mt7921: fix reset under the deep sleep is enabled
    
    [ Upstream commit 7bf0a71e839822bb6ba04a6e163ad334314e2659 ]
    
    To fix possibly the race to access register between the WiFi reset
    and the other context that is caused by explicitly cancelling ps_work
    and wake_work to break PM_STATE consistency.
    
    Deep sleep would cause the hardware into the inactive state,
    so we forcely put device drv_own state before we start to reset.
    
    The patch also ignore the reset request when the procedure is in
    progress to avoid the consecutive WiFi resets.

    kthread_stop() call happens before threadfn call.
    
    To prevent fancy error checking and make code
    more straightforward we moved all cleanup code out
    of kmmpd threadfn.
    
    Also, dropped struct mmpd_data at all. Now struct super_block
    is a threadfn data and struct buffer_head embedded into
    struct ext4_sb_info.

    Generally speaking, KUBSAN reports from the kernel should be fixed.
    However, in case of BPF, this particular report caused concerns since
    the large shift is not wrong from BPF point of view, just undefined.
    In the verifier, K-based shifts that are >= {64,32} (depending on the
    bitwidth of the instruction) are already rejected. The register-based
    cases were not given their content might not be known at verification
    time. Ideas such as verifier instruction rewrite with an additional
    AND instruction for the source register were brought up, but regularly
    rejected due to the additional runtime overhead they incur.
    
    As Edward Cree rightly put it:
    
      Shifts by more than insn bitness are legal in the BPF ISA; they are
      implementation-defined behaviour [of the underlying architecture],
      rather than UB, and have been made legal for performance reasons.
      Each of the JIT backends compiles the BPF shift operations to machine
      instructions which produce implementation-defined results in such a
      case; the resulting contents of the register may be arbitrary but
      program behaviour as a whole remains defined.
    
      Guard checks in the fast path (i.e. affecting JITted code) will thus
      not be accepted.
    
      The case of division by zero is not truly analogous here, as division
      instructions on many of the JIT-targeted architectures will raise a
      machine exception / fault on division by zero, whereas (to the best
      of my knowledge) none will do so on an out-of-bounds shift.
    
    Given the KUBSAN report only affects the BPF interpreter, but not JITs,
    one solution is to add the ANDs with 63 or 31 into ___bpf_prog_run().
    That would make the shifts defined, and thus shuts up KUBSAN, and the
    compiler would optimize out the AND on any CPU that interprets the shift
    amounts modulo the width anyway (e.g., confirmed from disassembly that
    on x86-64 and arm64 the generated interpreter code is the same before
    and after this fix).
    
    The BPF interpreter is slow path, and most likely compiled out anyway
    as distros select BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON to avoid speculative execution of
    BPF instructions by the interpreter. Given the main argument was to
    avoid sacrificing performance, the fact that the AND is optimized away
    from compiler for mainstream archs helps as well as a solution moving
    forward. Also add a comment on LSH/RSH/ARSH translation for JIT authors
    to provide guidance when they see the ___bpf_prog_run() interpreter
    code and use it as a model for a new JIT backend.

    Don't check the sequence number when deciding when to update time_in in
    the node table if tag removal is offloaded since the sequence number is
    part of the tag. This fixes a problem where the times in the node table
    wouldn't update when 0 appeared to be before or equal to seq_out when
    tag removal was offloaded.

    drm/amdkfd: Fix circular lock in nocpsch path
    
    [ Upstream commit a7b2451d31cfa2e8aeccf3b35612ce33f02371fc ]
    
    Calling free_mqd inside of destroy_queue_nocpsch_locked can cause a
    circular lock. destroy_queue_nocpsch_locked is called under a DQM lock,
    which is taken in MMU notifiers, potentially in FS reclaim context.
    Taking another lock, which is BO reservation lock from free_mqd, while
    causing an FS reclaim inside the DQM lock creates a problematic circular
    lock dependency. Therefore move free_mqd out of
    destroy_queue_nocpsch_locked and call it after unlocking DQM.

    [ Upstream commit 0b5f0f29b118910c89fe249cdfbc11b400a86a18 ]
    
    The SJA1110 switch integrates TJA1103 PHYs, but in SJA1110 switch rev B
    silicon, there is a bug in that the registers for selecting the 100base-T1
    autoneg master/slave roles are not writable.
    
    To enable write access to the master/slave registers, these additional
    PHY writes are necessary during initialization.
    
    The issue has been corrected in later SJA1110 silicon versions and is
    not present in the standalone PHY variants, but applying the workaround
    unconditionally in the driver should not do any harm.

    wlcore/wl12xx: Fix wl12xx get_mac error if device is in ELP
    
    [ Upstream commit 11ef6bc846dcdce838f0b00c5f6a562c57e5d43b ]
    
    At least on wl12xx, reading the MAC after boot can fail with a warning
    at drivers/net/wireless/ti/wlcore/sdio.c:78 wl12xx_sdio_raw_read.
    The failed call comes from wl12xx_get_mac() that wlcore_nvs_cb() calls
    after request_firmware_work_func().
    
    After the error, no wireless interface is created. Reloading the wl12xx
    module makes the interface work.
    
    Turns out the wlan controller can be in a low-power ELP state after the
    boot from the bootloader or kexec, and needs to be woken up first.
    
    Let's wake the hardware and add a sleep after that similar to
    wl12xx_pre_boot() is already doing.
    
    Note that a similar issue could exist for wl18xx, but I have not seen it
    so far. And a search for wl18xx_get_mac and wl12xx_sdio_raw_read did not
    produce similar errors.

    selftests: Clean forgotten resources as part of cleanup()
    
    [ Upstream commit e67dfb8d15deb33c425d0b0ee22f2e5eef54c162 ]
    
    Several tests do not set some ports down as part of their cleanup(),
    resulting in IPv6 link-local addresses and associated routes not being
    deleted.
    
    These leaks were found using a BPF tool that monitors ASIC resources.

    PHY will delay about 11.5ms to generate RXC clock when switching from
    power down to normal operation. Read/write registers would also cause RXC
    become unstable and stop for a while during this process. Realtek engineer
    suggests 15ms or more delay can workaround this issue.

    [ Upstream commit 665f28507a2a3d8d72ed9afa9a2b9b17fd43add1 ]
    
    [Why]
    When calculating recout width for an MPO plane on a mode that's using
    ODM combine, driver can calculate a negative value, resulting in a
    crash.
    
    [How]
    For negative widths, use zero such that validation will prune the
    configuration correctly and disallow MPO.

    [ Upstream commit 346cf627fb27c0fea63a041cedbaa4f31784e504 ]
    
    [why]
    DSCCLK validation is not necessary because DSCCLK is derrived from
    DISPCLK, therefore if DISPCLK validation passes, DSCCLK is valid, too.
    Doing DSCLK validation in addition to DISPCLK leads to modes being
    wrongly rejected when DSCCLK was incorrectly set outside of DML.
    
    [how]
    Remove DSCCLK validation because it's implicitly validated under DISPCLK

    [ Upstream commit 897120d41e7afd9da435cb00041a142aeeb53c07 ]
    
    Checking value of MCP_INTF in mcp23s08_irq suggests that the handler may be
    called even when there is no interrupt pending.
    
    But the actual interrupt could happened between reading MCP_INTF and MCP_GPIO.
    In this situation we got nothing from MCP_INTF, but the event gets acknowledged
    on the expander by reading MCP_GPIO. This leads to losing events.
    
    Fix the problem by not reading any register until we see something in MCP_INTF.
    
    The error was reproduced and fix tested on MCP23017.

    block: introduce BIO_ZONE_WRITE_LOCKED bio flag
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ffbbb435d8f566a0924ce4b5dc7fc1bceb6dbf8 ]
    
    Introduce the BIO flag BIO_ZONE_WRITE_LOCKED to indicate that a BIO owns
    the write lock of the zone it is targeting. This is the counterpart of
    the struct request flag RQF_ZONE_WRITE_LOCKED.
    
    This new BIO flag is reserved for now for zone write locking control
    for device mapper targets exposing a zoned block device. Since in this
    case, the lock flag must not be propagated to the struct request that
    will be used to process the BIO, a BIO private flag is used rather than
    changing the RQF_ZONE_WRITE_LOCKED request flag into a common REQ_XXX
    flag that could be used for both BIO and request. This avoids conflicts
    down the stack with the block IO scheduler zone write locking
    (in mq-deadline).

    If dm-writecache overwrites existing cached data, it splits the

    dm space maps: don't reset space map allocation cursor when committing
    
    [ Upstream commit 5faafc77f7de69147d1e818026b9a0cbf036a7b2 ]
    
    Current commit code resets the place where the search for free blocks
    will begin back to the start of the metadata device.  There are a couple
    of repercussions to this:
    
    - The first allocation after the commit is likely to take longer than
      normal as it searches for a free block in an area that is likely to
      have very few free blocks (if any).
    
    - Any free blocks it finds will have been recently freed.  Reusing them
      means we have fewer old copies of the metadata to aid recovery from
      hardware error.
    
    Fix these issues by leaving the cursor alone, only resetting when the
    search hits the end of the metadata device.

    net: tcp better handling of reordering then loss cases
    
    [ Upstream commit a29cb6914681a55667436a9eb7a42e28da8cf387 ]
    
    This patch aims to improve the situation when reordering and loss are
    ocurring in the same flight of packets.
    
    Previously the reordering would first induce a spurious recovery, then
    the subsequent ACK may undo the cwnd (based on the timestamps e.g.).
    However the current loss recovery does not proceed to invoke
    RACK to install a reordering timer. If some packets are also lost, this
    may lead to a long RTO-based recovery. An example is
    https://groups.google.com/g/bbr-dev/c/OFHADvJbTEI
    
    The solution is to after reverting the recovery, always invoke RACK
    to either mount the RACK timer to fast retransmit after the reordering
    window, or restarts the recovery if new loss is identified. Hence
    it is possible the sender may go from Recovery to Disorder/Open to
    Recovery again in one ACK.

    table for IP ID generation"), but focusing on some specific aspects
    of IPv6.
    
    Contary to IPv4, IPv6 only uses packet IDs with fragments, and with a
    minimum MTU of 1280, it's much less easy to force a remote peer to
    produce many fragments to explore its ID sequence. In addition packet
    IDs are 32-bit in IPv6, which further complicates their analysis. On
    the other hand, it is often easier to choose among plenty of possible
    source addresses and partially work around the bigger hash table the
    commit above permits, which leaves IPv6 partially exposed to some
    possibilities of remote analysis at the risk of weakening some
    protocols like DNS if some IDs can be predicted with a good enough
    probability.
    
    Given the wide range of permitted IDs, the risk of collision is extremely
    low so there's no need to rely on the positive increment algorithm that
    is shared with the IPv4 code via ip_idents_reserve(). We have a fast
    PRNG, so let's simply call prandom_u32() and be done with it.
    
    Performance measurements at 10 Gbps couldn't show any difference with
    the previous code, even when using a single core, because due to the
    large fragments, we're limited to only ~930 kpps at 10 Gbps and the cost
    of the random generation is completely offset by other operations and by
    the network transfer time. In addition, this change removes the need to
    update a shared entry in the idents table so it may even end up being
    slightly faster on large scale systems where this matters.
    
    The risk of at least one collision here is about 1/80 million among
    10 IDs, 1/850k among 100 IDs, and still only 1/8.5k among 1000 IDs,
    which remains very low compared to IPv4 where all IDs are reused
    every 4 to 80ms on a 10 Gbps flow depending on packet sizes.

    clk: tegra: Ensure that PLLU configuration is applied properly
    
    [ Upstream commit a7196048cd5168096c2c4f44a3939d7a6dcd06b9 ]
    
    The PLLU (USB) consists of the PLL configuration itself and configuration
    of the PLLU outputs. The PLLU programming is inconsistent on T30 vs T114,
    where T114 immediately bails out if PLLU is enabled and T30 re-enables
    a potentially already enabled PLL (left after bootloader) and then fully
    reprograms it, which could be unsafe to do. The correct way should be to
    skip enabling of the PLL if it's already enabled and then apply
    configuration to the outputs. This patch doesn't fix any known problems,
    it's a minor improvement.

    clk: tegra: Fix refcounting of gate clocks
    
    [ Upstream commit c592c8a28f5821e880ac6675781cd8a151b0737c ]
    
    The refcounting of the gate clocks has a bug causing the enable_refcnt
    to underflow when unused clocks are disabled. This happens because clk
    provider erroneously bumps the refcount if clock is enabled at a boot
    time, which it shouldn't be doing, and it does this only for the gate
    clocks, while peripheral clocks are using the same gate ops and the
    peripheral clocks are missing the initial bump. Hence the refcount of
    the peripheral clocks is 0 when unused clocks are disabled and then the
    counter is decremented further by the gate ops, causing the integer
    underflow.
    
    Fix this problem by removing the erroneous bump and by implementing the
    disable_unused() callback, which disables the unused gates properly.
    
    The visible effect of the bug is such that the unused clocks are never
    gated if a loaded kernel module grabs the unused clocks and starts to use
    them. In practice this shouldn't cause any real problems for the drivers
    and boards supported by the kernel today.

    net: stmmac: the XPCS obscures a potential "PHY not found" error
    
    [ Upstream commit 4751d2aa321f2828d8c5d2f7ce4ed18a01e47f46 ]
    
    stmmac_mdio_register() has logic to search for PHYs on the MDIO bus and
    assign them IRQ lines, as well as to set priv->plat->phy_addr.
    
    If no PHY is found, the "found" variable remains set to 0 and the
    function errors out.
    
    After the introduction of commit f213bbe8a9d6 ("net: stmmac: Integrate
    it with DesignWare XPCS"), the "found" variable was immediately reused
    for searching for a PCS on the same MDIO bus.
    
    This can result in 2 types of potential problems (none of them seems to
    be seen on the only Intel system that sets has_xpcs = true, otherwise it
    would have been reported):
    
    1. If a PCS is found but a PHY is not, then the code happily exits with
       no error. One might say "yes, but this is not possible, because
       of_mdiobus_register will probe a PHY for all MDIO addresses,
       including for the XPCS, so if an XPCS exists, then a PHY certainly
       exists too". Well, that is not true, see intel_mgbe_common_data():
    
            /* Ensure mdio bus scan skips intel serdes and pcs-xpcs */
            plat->mdio_bus_data->phy_mask = 1 << INTEL_MGBE_ADHOC_ADDR;
            plat->mdio_bus_data->phy_mask |= 1 << INTEL_MGBE_XPCS_ADDR;
    
    2. A PHY is found but an MDIO device with the XPCS PHY ID isn't, and in
       that case, the error message will be "No PHY found". Confusing.

    The igb driver was trying hard to be sparse correct, but somehow
    ended up converting a variable into little endian order and then
    tries to OR something with it.
    
    A much plainer way of doing things is to leave all variables and
    OR operations in CPU (non-endian) mode, and then convert to
    little endian only once, which is what this change does.
    
    This probably fixes a bug that might have been seen only on
    big endian systems.

    hardware revisions we override it to __be16 as done in this

    udf: Fix NULL pointer dereference in udf_symlink function
    
    [ Upstream commit fa236c2b2d4436d9f19ee4e5d5924e90ffd7bb43 ]
    
    In function udf_symlink, epos.bh is assigned with the value returned
    by udf_tgetblk. The function udf_tgetblk is defined in udf/misc.c
    and returns the value of sb_getblk function that could be NULL.
    Then, epos.bh is used without any check, causing a possible
    NULL pointer dereference when sb_getblk fails.
    
    This fix adds a check to validate the value of epos.bh.

    drm/scheduler: Fix hang when sched_entity released
    
    [ Upstream commit c61cdbdbffc169dc7f1e6fe94dfffaf574fe672a ]
    
    Problem: If scheduler is already stopped by the time sched_entity
    is released and entity's job_queue not empty I encountred
    a hang in drm_sched_entity_flush. This is because drm_sched_entity_is_idle
    never becomes false.
    
    Fix: In drm_sched_fini detach all sched_entities from the
    scheduler's run queues. This will satisfy drm_sched_entity_is_idle.
    Also wakeup all those processes stuck in sched_entity flushing
    as the scheduler main thread which wakes them up is stopped by now.
    
    v2:
    Reverse order of drm_sched_rq_remove_entity and marking
    s_entity as stopped to prevent reinserion back to rq due
    to race.
    
    v3:
    Drop drm_sched_rq_remove_entity, only modify entity->stopped
    and check for it in drm_sched_entity_is_idle

    [ Upstream commit 86544c3de6a2185409c5a3d02f674ea223a14217 ]
    
    Similar to the way in which of_mdiobus_register() has a fallback to the
    non-DT based mdiobus_register() when CONFIG_OF is not set, we can create
    a shim for the device-managed devm_of_mdiobus_register() which calls
    devm_mdiobus_register() and discards the struct device_node *.
    
    In particular, this solves a build issue with the qca8k DSA driver which
    uses devm_of_mdiobus_register and can be compiled without CONFIG_OF.

    [ Upstream commit 09da3191827f2fd326205fb58881838e6ea36fb7 ]
    
    GPUs with more than a single regulator (e.g. G72 on MT8183) will
    require platform-specific handling for devfreq, for 2 reasons:
     1. The opp core (drivers/opp/core.c:_generic_set_opp_regulator)
        does not support multiple regulators, so we'll need custom
        handlers.
     2. Generally, platforms with 2 regulators have platform-specific
        constraints on how the voltages should be set (e.g.
        minimum/maximum voltage difference between them), so we
        should not just create generic handlers that simply
        change the voltages without taking care of those constraints.
    
    Disable devfreq for now on those GPUs.

    net: Treat __napi_schedule_irqoff() as __napi_schedule() on PREEMPT_RT
    
    [ Upstream commit 8380c81d5c4fced6f4397795a5ae65758272bbfd ]
    
    __napi_schedule_irqoff() is an optimized version of __napi_schedule()
    which can be used where it is known that interrupts are disabled,
    e.g. in interrupt-handlers, spin_lock_irq() sections or hrtimer
    callbacks.
    
    On PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels this assumptions is not true. Force-
    threaded interrupt handlers and spinlocks are not disabling interrupts
    and the NAPI hrtimer callback is forced into softirq context which runs
    with interrupts enabled as well.
    
    Chasing all usage sites of __napi_schedule_irqoff() is a whack-a-mole
    game so make __napi_schedule_irqoff() invoke __napi_schedule() for
    PREEMPT_RT kernels.
    
    The callers of ____napi_schedule() in the networking core have been
    audited and are correct on PREEMPT_RT kernels as well.

    hugetlb: clear huge pte during flush function on mips platform
    
    [ Upstream commit 33ae8f801ad8bec48e886d368739feb2816478f2 ]
    
    If multiple threads are accessing the same huge page at the same
    time, hugetlb_cow will be called if one thread write the COW huge
    page. And function huge_ptep_clear_flush is called to notify other
    threads to clear the huge pte tlb entry. The other threads clear
    the huge pte tlb entry and reload it from page table, the reload
    huge pte entry may be old.
    
    This patch fixes this issue on mips platform, and it clears huge
    pte entry before notifying other threads to flush current huge
    page entry, it is similar with other architectures.

    On the Loongson64 platform, if CONFIG_SMP is not set, the following build
    error will occur:
    arch/mips/loongson64/reset.c:133:2: error:'secondary_kexec_args' undeclared
    
    Because the definition and declaration of secondary_kexec_args are in the
    CONFIG_SMP, the secondary_kexec_args variable should be used in CONFIG_SMP.

    drm/amd/display: Fix clock table filling logic
    
    [ Upstream commit c31bef1cb1203b26f901a511a3246204cfaf8a57 ]
    
    [Why]
    Currently, the code that fills the clock table can miss filling
    information about some of the higher voltage states advertised
    by the SMU. This, in turn, may cause some of the higher pixel clock
    modes (e.g. 8k60) to fail validation.
    
    [How]
    Fill the table with one entry per DCFCLK level instead of one entry
    per FCLK level. This is needed because the maximum FCLK does not
    necessarily need maximum voltage, whereas DCFCLK values from SMU
    cover the full voltage range.

    drm/imx: Add 8 pixel alignment fix
    
    [ Upstream commit 94dfec48fca756cef90263a03e81f24dae24a5c6 ]
    
    Some standard resolutions like 1366x768 do not work properly with
    i.MX6 SoCs, since the horizontal resolution needs to be aligned
    to 8 pixels (so 1360x768 or 1368x768 would work).
    
    This patch allocates framebuffers allocated to 8 pixels. The extra
    time required to send the extra pixels are removed from the blank
    time. In order to expose the correct display size to userspace,
    the stride is increased without increasing the width.
    
    Without this patch systems with this display resolution hang
    indefinitely during boot up.

    drm/bridge: nwl-dsi: Force a full modeset when crtc_state->active is changed to be true
    
    [ Upstream commit 3afb2a28fa2404d11cce1956a003f2aaca4da421 ]
    
    This patch replaces ->mode_fixup() with ->atomic_check() so that
    a full modeset can be requested from there when crtc_state->active
    is changed to be true(which implies only connector's DPMS is brought
    out of "Off" status, though not necessarily).  Bridge functions are
    added or changed to accommodate the ->atomic_check() callback.  That
    full modeset is needed by the up-coming patch which gets MIPI DSI
    controller and PHY ready in ->mode_set(), because it makes sure
    ->mode_set() and ->atomic_disable() are called in pairs.

    [ Upstream commit ba4e0339a6a33e2ba341703ce14ae8ca203cb2f1 ]
    
    [Bug][DP501]
    If ASPEED P2A (PCI to AHB) bridge is disabled and disallowed for
    CVE_2019_6260 item3, and then the monitor's EDID is unable read through
    Parade DP501.
    The reason is the DP501's FW is mapped to BMC addressing space rather
    than Host addressing space.
    The resolution is that using "pci_iomap_range()" maps to DP501's FW that
    stored on the end of FB (Frame Buffer).
    In this case, FrameBuffer reserves the last 2MB used for the image of
    DP501.
