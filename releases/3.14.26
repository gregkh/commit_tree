    nfs: Don't busy-wait on SIGKILL in __nfs_iocounter_wait
    
    commit 92a56555bd576c61b27a5cab9f38a33a1e9a1df5 upstream.
    
    If a SIGKILL is sent to a task waiting in __nfs_iocounter_wait,
    it will busy-wait or soft lockup in its while loop.
    nfs_wait_bit_killable won't sleep, and the loop won't exit on
    the error return.
    
    Stop the busy-wait by breaking out of the loop when
    nfs_wait_bit_killable returns an error.

    x86: kvm: use alternatives for VMCALL vs. VMMCALL if kernel text is read-only
    
    commit c1118b3602c2329671ad5ec8bdf8e374323d6343 upstream.
    
    On x86_64, kernel text mappings are mapped read-only with CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA.
    In that case, KVM will fail to patch VMCALL instructions to VMMCALL
    as required on AMD processors.
    
    The failure mode is currently a divide-by-zero exception, which obviously
    is a KVM bug that has to be fixed.  However, picking the right instruction
    between VMCALL and VMMCALL will be faster and will help if you cannot upgrade
    the hypervisor.

    locks: eliminate BUG() call when there's an unexpected lock on file close
    
    commit 8c3cac5e6a85f03602ffe09c44f14418699e31ec upstream.
    
    A leftover lock on the list is surely a sign of a problem of some sort,
    but it's not necessarily a reason to panic the box. Instead, just log a
    warning with some info about the lock, and then delete it like we would
    any other lock.
    
    In the event that the filesystem declares a ->lock f_op, we may end up
    leaking something, but that's generally preferable to an immediate
    panic.

    bitops: Fix shift overflow in GENMASK macros
    
    commit 00b4d9a14125f1e51874def2b9de6092e007412d upstream.
    
    On some 32 bits architectures, including x86, GENMASK(31, 0) returns 0
    instead of the expected ~0UL.
    
    This is the same on some 64 bits architectures with GENMASK_ULL(63, 0).
    
    This is due to an overflow in the shift operand, 1 << 32 for GENMASK,
    1 << 64 for GENMASK_ULL.

    gpu/radeon: Set flag to indicate broken 64-bit MSI
    
    commit 91ed6fd2c383bb8f02d66e98b4a4d2f7207249dc upstream.
    
    Some radeon ASICs don't support all 64 address bits of MSIs despite
    advertising support for 64-bit MSIs in their configuration space.
    
    This breaks on systems such as IBM POWER7/8, where 64-bit MSIs can
    be assigned with some of the high address bits set.
    
    This makes use of the newly introduced "no_64bit_msi" flag in structure
    pci_dev to allow the MSI allocation code to fallback to 32-bit MSIs
    on those adapters.
    
    Adding Alex's review tag. Patch to the driver is identical to the
    reviewed one, I dropped the arch/powerpc hunk rewrote the subject
    and cset comment.

    bnx2fc: do not add shared skbs to the fcoe_rx_list
    
    commit 01a4cc4d0cd6a836c7b923760e8eb1cbb6a47258 upstream.
    
    In some cases, the fcoe_rx_list may contains multiple instances
    of the same skb (the so called "shared skbs").
    
    the bnx2fc_l2_rcv thread is a loop that extracts a skb from the list,
    modifies (and destroys) its content and then proceed to the next one.
    The problem is that if the skb is shared, the remaining instances will
    be corrupted.
    
    The solution is to use skb_share_check() before adding the skb to the
    fcoe_rx_list.

    net/ping: handle protocol mismatching scenario
    
    commit 91a0b603469069cdcce4d572b7525ffc9fd352a6 upstream.
    
    ping_lookup() may return a wrong sock if sk_buff's and sock's protocols
    dont' match. For example, sk_buff's protocol is ETH_P_IPV6, but sock's
    sk_family is AF_INET, in that case, if sk->sk_bound_dev_if is zero, a wrong
    sock will be returned.
    the fix is to "continue" the searching, if no matching, return NULL.

    commit 1b19453d1c6abcfa7c312ba6c9f11a277568fc94 upstream.
    
    Currently, the DRC cache pruner will stop scanning the list when it
    hits an entry that is RC_INPROG. It's possible however for a call to
    take a *very* long time. In that case, we don't want it to block other
    entries from being pruned if they are expired or we need to trim the
    cache to get back under the limit.
    
    Fix the DRC cache pruner to just ignore RC_INPROG entries.

    The currect code for nfsd41_cb_get_slot() and nfsd4_cb_done() has no

    the form.

    ======                                  ======
    if (test_and_set_bit(0) != 0) {
                                            clear_bit(0)

            rpc_sleep_on(queue)
            return false;

    This patch breaks the race condition by adding a retest of the bit
    after the call to rpc_sleep_on().

    rt2x00: do not align payload on modern H/W
    
    commit cfd9167af14eb4ec21517a32911d460083ee3d59 upstream.
    
    RT2800 and newer hardware require padding between header and payload if
    header length is not multiple of 4.
    
    For historical reasons we also align payload to to 4 bytes boundary, but
    such alignment is not needed on modern H/W.
    
    Patch fixes skb_under_panic problems reported from time to time:
    
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84911
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=72471
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-wireless&m=139108549530402&w=2
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1087591
    
    Panic happened because we eat 4 bytes of skb headroom on each
    (re)transmission when sending frame without the payload and the header
    length not being multiple of 4 (i.e. QoS header has 26 bytes). On such
    case because paylad_aling=2 is bigger than header_align=0 we increase
    header_align by 4 bytes. To prevent that we could change the check to:
    
            if (payload_length && payload_align > header_align)
                    header_align += 4;
    
    but not aligning payload at all is more effective and alignment is not
    really needed by H/W (that has been tested on OpenWrt project for few
    years now).

    vhost-scsi: Take configfs group dependency during VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT
    
    commit ab8edab132829b26dd13db6caca3c242cce35dc1 upstream.
    
    This patch addresses a bug where individual vhost-scsi configfs endpoint
    groups can be removed from below while active exports to QEMU userspace
    still exist, resulting in an OOPs.
    
    It adds a configfs_depend_item() in vhost_scsi_set_endpoint() to obtain
    an explicit dependency on se_tpg->tpg_group in order to prevent individual
    vhost-scsi WWPN endpoints from being released via normal configfs methods
    while an QEMU ioctl reference still exists.
    
    Also, add matching configfs_undepend_item() in vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint()
    to release the dependency, once QEMU's reference to the individual group
    at /sys/kernel/config/target/vhost/$WWPN/$TPGT is released.
    
    (Fix up vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint() error path - DanC)

    spi: dw: Fix dynamic speed change.
    
    commit 0a8727e69778683495058852f783eeda141a754e upstream.
    
    An IOCTL call that calls spi_setup() and then dw_spi_setup() will
    overwrite the persisted last transfer speed. On each transfer, the
    SPI speed is compared to the last transfer speed to determine if the
    clock divider registers need to be updated (did the speed change?).
    This bug was observed with the spidev driver using spi-config to
    update the max transfer speed.
    
    This fix: Don't overwrite the persisted last transaction clock speed
    when updating the SPI parameters in dw_spi_setup(). On the next
    transaction, the new speed won't match the persisted last speed
    and the hardware registers will be updated.
    On initialization, the persisted last transaction clock
    speed will be 0 but will be updated after the first SPI
    transaction.
    
    Move zeroed clock divider check into clock change test because
    chip->clk_div is zero on startup and would cause a divide-by-zero
    error. The calculation was wrong as well (can't support odd #).

    iser-target: Disable TX completion interrupt coalescing
    
    commit 0d0f660d882c1c02748ced13966a2413aa5d6cc2 upstream.
    
    This patch explicitly disables TX completion interrupt coalescing logic
    in isert_put_response() and isert_put_datain() that was originally added
    as an efficiency optimization in commit 95b60f07.
    
    It has been reported that this change can trigger ABORT_TASK timeouts
    under certain small block workloads, where disabling coalescing was
    required for stability.  According to Sagi, this doesn't impact
    overall performance, so go ahead and disable it for now.

    The xpad wireless endpoint is not a bulk endpoint on my devices, but
    rather an interrupt one, so the USB core complains when it is submitted.
    I'm guessing that the author really did mean that this should be an
    interrupt urb, but as there are a zillion different xpad devices out
    there, let's cover out bases and handle both bulk and interrupt
    endpoints just as easily.

    ARM: 8226/1: cacheflush: get rid of restarting block
    
    commit 3f4aa45ceea5789a4aade536acc27f2e0d3da5e1 upstream.
    
    We cannot restart cacheflush safely if a process provides user-defined
    signal handler and signal is pending. In this case -EINTR is returned
    and it is expected that process re-invokes syscall. However, there are
    a few problems with that:
     * looks like nobody bothers checking return value from cacheflush
     * but if it did, we don't provide the restart address for that, so the
       process has to use the same range again
     * ...and again, what might lead to looping forever
    
    So, remove cacheflush restarting code and terminate cache flushing
    as early as fatal signal is pending.

    commit 995ab5189d1d7264e79e665dfa032a19b3ac646e upstream.
    
    Under extremely rare conditions, in an MPCore node consisting of at
    least 3 CPUs, two CPUs trying to perform a STREX to data on the same
    shared cache line can enter a livelock situation.
    
    This patch enables the HW mechanism that overcomes the bug. This fixes
    the incorrect setup of the STREX backoff delay bit due to a wrong
    description in the specification.
    
    Note that enabling the STREX backoff delay mechanism is done by
    leaving the bit *cleared*, while the bit was currently being set by
    the proc-v7.S code.
    
    [Thomas: adapt to latest mainline, slightly reword the commit log, add

    ARM: 8216/1: xscale: correct auxiliary register in suspend/resume
    
    commit ef59a20ba375aeb97b3150a118318884743452a8 upstream.
    
    According to the manuals I have, XScale auxiliary register should be
    reached with opc_2 = 1 instead of crn = 1. cpu_xscale_proc_init
    correctly uses c1, c0, 1 arguments, but cpu_xscale_do_suspend and
    cpu_xscale_do_resume use c1, c1, 0. Correct suspend/resume functions to
    also use c1, c0, 1.
    
    The issue was primarily noticed thanks to qemu reporing "unsupported
    instruction" on the pxa suspend path. Confirmed in PXA210/250 and PXA255
    XScale Core manuals and in PXA270 and PXA320 Developers Guides.
    
    Harware tested by me on tosa (pxa255). Robert confirmed on pxa270 board.

    But there is still a paragraph at the end that prohibits having both and
    says 'interrupts' should be preferred.

    aio: fix uncorrent dirty pages accouting when truncating AIO ring buffer
    
    commit 835f252c6debd204fcd607c79975089b1ecd3472 upstream.
    
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86831
    
    Markus reported that when shutting down mysqld (with AIO support,
    on a ext3 formatted Harddrive) leads to a negative number of dirty pages
    (underrun to the counter). The negative number results in a drastic reduction
    of the write performance because the page cache is not used, because the kernel
    thinks it is still 2 ^ 32 dirty pages open.
    
    Add a warn trace in __dec_zone_state will catch this easily:
    
    static inline void __dec_zone_state(struct zone *zone, enum
            zone_stat_item item)
    {
         atomic_long_dec(&zone->vm_stat[item]);
    +    WARN_ON_ONCE(item == NR_FILE_DIRTY &&
            atomic_long_read(&zone->vm_stat[item]) < 0);
         atomic_long_dec(&vm_stat[item]);

    The cause is that we set the aio ring file pages as *DIRTY* via SetPageDirty
    (bypasses the VFS dirty pages increment) when init, and aio fs uses
    *default_backing_dev_info* as the backing dev, which does not disable
    the dirty pages accounting capability.
    So truncating aio ring file will contribute to accounting dirty pages (VFS
    dirty pages decrement), then error occurs.
    
    The original goal is keeping these pages in memory (can not be reclaimed
    or swapped) in life-time via marking it dirty. But thinking more, we have
    already pinned pages via elevating the page's refcount, which can already
    achieve the goal, so the SetPageDirty seems unnecessary.
    
    In order to fix the issue, using the __set_page_dirty_no_writeback instead
    of the nop .set_page_dirty, and dropped the SetPageDirty (don't manually
    set the dirty flags, don't disable set_page_dirty(), rely on default behaviour).
    
    With the above change, the dirty pages accounting can work well. But as we
    known, aio fs is an anonymous one, which should never cause any real write-back,
    we can ignore the dirty pages (write back) accounting by disabling the dirty
    pages (write back) accounting capability. So we introduce an aio private
    backing dev info (disabled the ACCT_DIRTY/WRITEBACK/ACCT_WB capabilities) to
    replace the default one.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Add ctrl message delay quirk for Marantz/Denon devices
    
    commit 6e84a8d7ac3ba246ef44e313e92bc16a1da1b04a upstream.
    
    This patch adds a USB control message delay quirk for a few specific Marantz/Denon
    devices. Without the delay the DACs will not work properly and produces the
    following type of messages:
    
    Nov 15 10:09:21 orwell kernel: [   91.342880] usb 3-13: clock source 41 is not valid, cannot use
    Nov 15 10:09:21 orwell kernel: [   91.343775] usb 3-13: clock source 41 is not valid, cannot use
    
    There are likely other Marantz/Denon devices using the same USB module which exhibit the
    same problems. But as this cannot be verified I limited the patch to the devices
    I could test.
    
    The following two devices are covered by this path:
    - Marantz SA-14S1
    - Marantz HD-DAC1

    usb: xhci: rework root port wake bits if controller isn't allowed to wakeup
    
    commit a1377e5397ab321e21b793ec8cd2b6f12bd3c718 upstream.
    
    When system is being suspended, if host device is not allowed to do wakeup,
    xhci_suspend() needs to clear all root port wake on bits. Otherwise, some
    platforms may generate spurious wakeup, even if PCI PME# is disabled.
    
    The initial commit ff8cbf250b44 ("xhci: clear root port wake on bits"),
    which also got into stable, turned out to not work correctly and had to
    be reverted, and is now rewritten.

    USB: xhci: don't start a halted endpoint before its new dequeue is set
    
    commit c3492dbfa1050debf23a5b5cd2bc7514c5b37896 upstream.
    
    A halted endpoint ring must first be reset, then move the ring
    dequeue pointer past the problematic TRB. If we start the ring too
    early after reset, but before moving the dequeue pointer we
    will end up executing the same problematic TRB again.
    
    As we always issue a set transfer dequeue command after a reset
    endpoint command we can skip starting endpoint rings at reset endpoint
    command completion.
    
    Without this fix we end up trying to handle the same faulty TD for
    contol endpoints. causing timeout, and failing testusb ctrl_out write
    tests.

    On pseries system (LPAR) xmon failed to enter when running in LE mode,
    system is hunging. Inititating xmon will lead to such an output on the
    console:

    The root cause is that xmon is calling RTAS to turn off the surveillance

    of/base: Fix PowerPC address parsing hack
    
    commit 746c9e9f92dde2789908e51a354ba90a1962a2eb upstream.
    
    We have a historical hack that treats missing ranges properties as the
    equivalent of an empty one. This is needed for ancient PowerMac "bad"
    device-trees, and shouldn't be enabled for any other PowerPC platform,
    otherwise we get some nasty layout of devices in sysfs or even
    duplication when a set of otherwise identically named devices is
    created multiple times under a different parent node with no ranges
    property.
    
    This fix is needed for the PowerNV i2c busses to be exposed properly
    and will fix a number of other embedded cases.

    commit 4e6ce4dc7ce71d0886908d55129d5d6482a27ff9 upstream.
    
    Based on the reference clock, which could be 25MHz or 40MHz,
    AR_RTC_DERIVED_CLK is programmed differently for AR9340 and AR9550.
    But, when a chip reset is done, processing the initvals
    sets the register back to the default value.
    
    Fix this by moving the code in ath9k_hw_init_pll() to
    ar9003_hw_override_ini(). Also, do this override for AR9531.

    ASoC: dpcm: Fix race between FE/BE updates and trigger
    
    commit ea9d0d771fcd32cd56070819749477d511ec9117 upstream.
    
    DPCM can update the FE/BE connection states totally asynchronously
    from the FE's PCM state.  Most of FE/BE state changes are protected by
    mutex, so that they won't race, but there are still some actions that
    are uncovered.  For example, suppose to switch a BE while a FE's
    stream is running.  This would call soc_dpcm_runtime_update(), which
    sets FE's runtime_update flag, then sets up and starts BEs, and clears
    FE's runtime_update flag again.
    
    When a device emits XRUN during this operation, the PCM core triggers
    snd_pcm_stop(XRUN).  Since the trigger action is an atomic ops, this
    isn't blocked by the mutex, thus it kicks off DPCM's trigger action.
    It eventually updates and clears FE's runtime_update flag while
    soc_dpcm_runtime_update() is running concurrently, and it results in
    confusion.
    
    Usually, for avoiding such a race, we take a lock.  There is a PCM
    stream lock for that purpose.  However, as already mentioned, the
    trigger action is atomic, and we can't take the lock for the whole
    soc_dpcm_runtime_update() or other operations that include the lengthy
    jobs like hw_params or prepare.
    
    This patch provides an alternative solution.  This adds a way to defer
    the conflicting trigger callback to be executed at the end of FE/BE
    state changes.  For doing it, two things are introduced:
    
    - Each runtime_update state change of FEs is protected via PCM stream
      lock.
    - The FE's trigger callback checks the runtime_update flag.  If it's
      not set, the trigger action is executed there.  If set, mark the
      pending trigger action and returns immediately.
    - At the exit of runtime_update state change, it checks whether the
      pending trigger is present.  If yes, it executes the trigger action
      at this point.

    commit c251ea7bd7a04f1f2575467e0de76e803cf59149 upstream.
    
    On a mx28evk with a sgtl5000 codec we notice a loud 'click' sound  to happen
    5 seconds after the end of a playback.
    
    The SMALL_POP bit should fix this, but its definition is incorrect:
    according to the sgtl5000 manual it is bit 0 of CHIP_REF_CTRL register, not
    bit 1.
    
    Fix the definition accordingly and enable the bit as intended per the code
    comment.
    
    After applying this change, no loud 'click' sound is heard after playback

    commit f57915cfa5b2b14c1cffa2e83c034f55e3f0e70d upstream.
    
    This patch adds a max_send_sge=2 minimum in isert_conn_setup_qp()
    to ensure outgoing control PDU responses with tx_desc->num_sge=2
    are able to function correctly.
    
    This addresses a bug with RDMA hardware using dev_attr.max_sge=3,
    that in the original code with the ConnectX-2 work-around would
    result in isert_conn->max_sge=1 being negotiated.

    The interrupts were activated and the handler registered before the clockevent
    was registered in the probe function.
    
    The interrupt handler, however, was making the assumption that the clockevent
    device was registered.
    
    That could cause a null pointer dereference if the timer interrupt was firing

    Fix that by moving the clockevent registration before the interrupt is enabled.

    PCI: Support 64-bit bridge windows if we have 64-bit dma_addr_t
    
    commit 7fc986d8a9727e5d40da3c2c1c343da6142e82a9 upstream.
    
    Aaron reported that a 32-bit x86 kernel with Physical Address Extension
    (PAE) support complains about bridge prefetchable memory windows above 4GB:
    
      pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x380000000000-0x383fffffffff]

      pci 0000:00:02.2: can't handle 64-bit address space for bridge
    
    In this kernel, unsigned long is 32 bits and dma_addr_t is 64 bits.
    Previously we used "unsigned long" to hold the bridge window address.  But
    this is a bus address, so we should use dma_addr_t instead.
    
    Use dma_addr_t to hold the bridge window base and limit.
    
    The question of whether the CPU can actually *address* the window is
    separate and depends on what the physical address space of the CPU is and
    whether the host bridge does any address translation.

    ipx: fix locking regression in ipx_sendmsg and ipx_recvmsg
    
    [ Upstream commit 01462405f0c093b2f8dfddafcadcda6c9e4c5cdf ]
    
    This fixes an old regression introduced by commit
    b0d0d915 (ipx: remove the BKL).
    
    When a recvmsg syscall blocks waiting for new data, no data can be sent on the
    same socket with sendmsg because ipx_recvmsg() sleeps with the socket locked.
    
    This breaks mars-nwe (NetWare emulator):
    - the ncpserv process reads the request using recvmsg
    - ncpserv forks and spawns nwconn
    - ncpserv calls a (blocking) recvmsg and waits for new requests
    - nwconn deadlocks in sendmsg on the same socket
    
    Commit b0d0d915 has simply replaced BKL locking with
    lock_sock/release_sock. Unlike now, BKL got unlocked while
    sleeping, so a blocking recvmsg did not block a concurrent
    sendmsg.
    
    Only keep the socket locked while actually working with the socket data and
    release it prior to calling skb_recv_datagram().

    bonding: fix curr_active_slave/carrier with loadbalance arp monitoring
    
    [ Upstream commit b8e4500f42fe4464a33a887579147050bed8fcef ]
    
    Since commit 6fde8f037e60 ("bonding: fix locking in
    bond_loadbalance_arp_mon()") we can have a stale bond carrier state and
    stale curr_active_slave when using arp monitoring in loadbalance modes. The
    reason is that in bond_loadbalance_arp_mon() we can't have
    do_failover == true but slave_state_changed == false, whenever do_failover
    is true then slave_state_changed is also true. Then the following piece
    from bond_loadbalance_arp_mon():
                    if (slave_state_changed) {
                            bond_slave_state_change(bond);
                            if (BOND_MODE(bond) == BOND_MODE_XOR)
                                    bond_update_slave_arr(bond, NULL);
                    } else if (do_failover) {
                            block_netpoll_tx();
                            bond_select_active_slave(bond);
                            unblock_netpoll_tx();
                    }
    
    will execute only the first branch, always and regardless of do_failover.
    Since these two events aren't related in such way, we need to decouple and
    consider them separately.
    
    For example this issue could lead to the following result:
    Bonding Mode: load balancing (round-robin)
    *MII Status: down*
    MII Polling Interval (ms): 0
    Up Delay (ms): 0
    Down Delay (ms): 0
    ARP Polling Interval (ms): 100
    ARP IP target/s (n.n.n.n form): 192.168.9.2
    
    Slave Interface: ens12
    *MII Status: up*
    Speed: 10000 Mbps
    Duplex: full
    Link Failure Count: 2
    Permanent HW addr: 00:0f:53:01:42:2c
    Slave queue ID: 0
    
    Slave Interface: eth1
    *MII Status: up*
    Speed: Unknown
    Duplex: Unknown
    Link Failure Count: 70
    Permanent HW addr: 52:54:00:2f:0f:8e
    Slave queue ID: 0
    
    Since some interfaces are up, then the status of the bond should also be
    up, but it will never change unless something invokes bond_set_carrier()
    (i.e. enslave, bond_select_active_slave etc). Now, if I force the
    calling of bond_select_active_slave via for example changing
    primary_reselect (it can change in any mode), then the MII status goes to
    "up" because it calls bond_select_active_slave() which should've been done
    from bond_loadbalance_arp_mon() itself.

    inetdevice: fixed signed integer overflow
    
    [ Upstream commit 84bc88688e3f6ef843aa8803dbcd90168bb89faf ]
    
    There could be a signed overflow in the following code.
    
    The expression, (32-logmask) is comprised between 0 and 31 included.
    It may be equal to 31.
    In such a case the left shift will produce a signed integer overflow.
    According to the C99 Standard, this is an undefined behavior.
    A simple fix is to replace the signed int 1 with the unsigned int 1U.

    uprobes, x86: Fix _TIF_UPROBE vs _TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME
    
    commit 82975bc6a6df743b9a01810fb32cb65d0ec5d60b upstream.
    
    x86 call do_notify_resume on paranoid returns if TIF_UPROBE is set but
    not on non-paranoid returns.  I suspect that this is a mistake and that
    the code only works because int3 is paranoid.
    
    Setting _TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME in the uprobe code was probably a workaround
    for the x86 bug.  With that bug fixed, we can remove _TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME
    from the uprobes code.

    x86, mm: Set NX across entire PMD at boot
    
    commit 45e2a9d4701d8c624d4a4bcdd1084eae31e92f58 upstream.
    
    When setting up permissions on kernel memory at boot, the end of the
    PMD that was split from bss remained executable. It should be NX like
    the rest. This performs a PMD alignment instead of a PAGE alignment to
    get the correct span of memory.

    x86: Require exact match for 'noxsave' command line option
    
    commit 2cd3949f702692cf4c5d05b463f19cd706a92dd3 upstream.
    
    We have some very similarly named command-line options:
    
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c:__setup("noxsave", x86_xsave_setup);
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c:__setup("noxsaveopt", x86_xsaveopt_setup);
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c:__setup("noxsaves", x86_xsaves_setup);
    
    __setup() is designed to match options that take arguments, like
    "foo=bar" where you would have:
    
            __setup("foo", x86_foo_func...);
    
    The problem is that "noxsave" actually _matches_ "noxsaves" in
    the same way that "foo" matches "foo=bar".  If you boot an old
    kernel that does not know about "noxsaves" with "noxsaves" on the
    command line, it will interpret the argument as "noxsave", which
    is not what you want at all.
    
    This makes the "noxsave" handler only return success when it finds
    an *exact* match.
    
    [ tglx: We really need to make __setup() more robust. ]

    x86_64, traps: Rework bad_iret
    
    commit b645af2d5905c4e32399005b867987919cbfc3ae upstream.
    
    It's possible for iretq to userspace to fail.  This can happen because
    of a bad CS, SS, or RIP.
    
    Historically, we've handled it by fixing up an exception from iretq to
    land at bad_iret, which pretends that the failed iret frame was really
    the hardware part of #GP(0) from userspace.  To make this work, there's
    an extra fixup to fudge the gs base into a usable state.
    
    This is suboptimal because it loses the original exception.  It's also
    buggy because there's no guarantee that we were on the kernel stack to
    begin with.  For example, if the failing iret happened on return from an
    NMI, then we'll end up executing general_protection on the NMI stack.
    This is bad for several reasons, the most immediate of which is that
    general_protection, as a non-paranoid idtentry, will try to deliver
    signals and/or schedule from the wrong stack.
    
    This patch throws out bad_iret entirely.  As a replacement, it augments
    the existing swapgs fudge into a full-blown iret fixup, mostly written
    in C.  It's should be clearer and more correct.

    x86_64, traps: Stop using IST for #SS
    
    commit 6f442be2fb22be02cafa606f1769fa1e6f894441 upstream.
    
    On a 32-bit kernel, this has no effect, since there are no IST stacks.
    
    On a 64-bit kernel, #SS can only happen in user code, on a failed iret
    to user space, a canonical violation on access via RSP or RBP, or a
    genuine stack segment violation in 32-bit kernel code.  The first two
    cases don't need IST, and the latter two cases are unlikely fatal bugs,
    and promoting them to double faults would be fine.
    
    This fixes a bug in which the espfix64 code mishandles a stack segment
    violation.
    
    This saves 4k of memory per CPU and a tiny bit of code.

    justify writing it in assembly.  Move it to C.
    
    This also fixes a bug: if the double fault came from an IST stack, the

    commit 26927f76499849e095714452b8a4e09350f6a3b9 upstream.
    
    If SERIAL_8250 is compiled as a module, the platform specific setup
    for Loongson will be a module too, and it will not work very well.
    At least on Loongson 3 it will trigger a build failure,
    since loongson_sysconf is not exported to modules.
