    ipvs: uninitialized data with IP_VS_IPV6
    
    commit 3b05ac3824ed9648c0d9c02d51d9b54e4e7e874f upstream.
    
    The app_tcp_pkt_out() function expects "*diff" to be set and ends up
    using uninitialized data if CONFIG_IP_VS_IPV6 is turned on.
    
    The same issue is there in app_tcp_pkt_in().  Thanks to Julian Anastasov
    for noticing that.

    ipvs: rerouting to local clients is not needed anymore
    
    commit 579eb62ac35845686a7c4286c0a820b4eb1f96aa upstream.
    
    commit f5a41847acc5 ("ipvs: move ip_route_me_harder for ICMP")
    from 2.6.37 introduced ip_route_me_harder() call for responses to
    local clients, so that we can provide valid rt_src after SNAT.
    It was used by TCP to provide valid daddr for ip_send_reply().
    After commit 0a5ebb8000c5 ("ipv4: Pass explicit daddr arg to
    ip_send_reply()." from 3.0 this rerouting is not needed anymore
    and should be avoided, especially in LOCAL_IN.

    spi: spidev: fix possible arithmetic overflow for multi-transfer message
    
    commit f20fbaad7620af2df36a1f9d1c9ecf48ead5b747 upstream.
    
    `spidev_message()` sums the lengths of the individual SPI transfers to
    determine the overall SPI message length.  It restricts the total
    length, returning an error if too long, but it does not check for
    arithmetic overflow.  For example, if the SPI message consisted of two
    transfers and the first has a length of 10 and the second has a length
    of (__u32)(-1), the total length would be seen as 9, even though the
    second transfer is actually very long.  If the second transfer specifies
    a null `rx_buf` and a non-null `tx_buf`, the `copy_from_user()` could
    overrun the spidev's pre-allocated tx buffer before it reaches an
    invalid user memory address.  Fix it by checking that neither the total
    nor the individual transfer lengths exceed the maximum allowed value.
    
    Thanks to Dan Carpenter for reporting the potential integer overflow.

    net: make skb_gso_segment error handling more robust
    
    commit 330966e501ffe282d7184fde4518d5e0c24bc7f8 upstream.
    
    skb_gso_segment has three possible return values:
    1. a pointer to the first segmented skb
    2. an errno value (IS_ERR())
    3. NULL.  This can happen when GSO is used for header verification.
    
    However, several callers currently test IS_ERR instead of IS_ERR_OR_NULL
    and would oops when NULL is returned.
    
    Note that these call sites should never actually see such a NULL return
    value; all callers mask out the GSO bits in the feature argument.
    
    However, there have been issues with some protocol handlers erronously not
    respecting the specified feature mask in some cases.
    
    It is preferable to get 'have to turn off hw offloading, else slow' reports
    rather than 'kernel crashes'.

    tcp: avoid looping in tcp_send_fin()
    
    [ Upstream commit 845704a535e9b3c76448f52af1b70e4422ea03fd ]
    
    Presence of an unbound loop in tcp_send_fin() had always been hard
    to explain when analyzing crash dumps involving gigantic dying processes
    with millions of sockets.
    
    Lets try a different strategy :
    
    In case of memory pressure, try to add the FIN flag to last packet
    in write queue, even if packet was already sent. TCP stack will
    be able to deliver this FIN after a timeout event. Note that this
    FIN being delivered by a retransmit, it also carries a Push flag
    given our current implementation.
    
    By checking sk_under_memory_pressure(), we anticipate that cooking
    many FIN packets might deplete tcp memory.
    
    In the case we could not allocate a packet, even with __GFP_WAIT
    allocation, then not sending a FIN seems quite reasonable if it allows
    to get rid of this socket, free memory, and not block the process from
    eventually doing other useful work.

    ip_forward: Drop frames with attached skb->sk

    Initial discussion was:
    [FYI] xfrm: Don't lookup sk_policy for timewait sockets
    
    Forwarded frames should not have a socket attached. Especially
    tw sockets will lead to panics later-on in the stack.
    
    This was observed with TPROXY assigning a tw socket and broken
    policy routing (misconfigured). As a result frame enters
    forwarding path instead of input. We cannot solve this in
    TPROXY as it cannot know that policy routing is broken.

    tcp: make connect() mem charging friendly
    
    [ Upstream commit 355a901e6cf1b2b763ec85caa2a9f04fbcc4ab4a ]
    
    While working on sk_forward_alloc problems reported by Denys
    Fedoryshchenko, we found that tcp connect() (and fastopen) do not call
    sk_wmem_schedule() for SYN packet (and/or SYN/DATA packet), so
    sk_forward_alloc is negative while connect is in progress.
    
    We can fix this by calling regular sk_stream_alloc_skb() both for the
    SYN packet (in tcp_connect()) and the syn_data packet in
    tcp_send_syn_data()
    
    Then, tcp_send_syn_data() can avoid copying syn_data as we simply
    can manipulate syn_data->cb[] to remove SYN flag (and increment seq)
    
    Instead of open coding memcpy_fromiovecend(), simply use this helper.
    
    This leaves in socket write queue clean fast clone skbs.
    
    This was tested against our fastopen packetdrill tests.

    rds: avoid potential stack overflow
    
    [ Upstream commit f862e07cf95d5b62a5fc5e981dd7d0dbaf33a501 ]
    
    The rds_iw_update_cm_id function stores a large 'struct rds_sock' object
    on the stack in order to pass a pair of addresses. This happens to just
    fit withint the 1024 byte stack size warning limit on x86, but just
    exceed that limit on ARM, which gives us this warning:
    
    net/rds/iw_rdma.c:200:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
    
    As the use of this large variable is basically bogus, we can rearrange
    the code to not do that. Instead of passing an rds socket into
    rds_iw_get_device, we now just pass the two addresses that we have
    available in rds_iw_update_cm_id, and we change rds_iw_get_mr accordingly,
    to create two address structures on the stack there.

    [ Upstream commit b1cb59cf2efe7971d3d72a7b963d09a512d994c9 ]
    
    sysctl has sysctl.net.core.rmem_*/wmem_* parameters which can be
    set to incorrect values. Given that 'struct sk_buff' allocates from
    rcvbuf, incorrectly set buffer length could result to memory
    allocation failures. For example, set them as follows:
    
        # sysctl net.core.rmem_default=64
          net.core.wmem_default = 64
        # sysctl net.core.wmem_default=64
          net.core.wmem_default = 64
        # ping localhost -s 1024 -i 0 > /dev/null
    
    This could result to the following failure:

    net: avoid to hang up on sending due to sysctl configuration overflow.
    
    commit cdda88912d62f9603d27433338a18be83ef23ac1 upstream.
    
        I found if we write a larger than 4GB value to some sysctl
    variables, the sending syscall will hang up forever, because these
    variables are 32 bits, such large values make them overflow to 0 or
    negative.

    of below sysctl variables:

    net: ping: Return EAFNOSUPPORT when appropriate.
    
    [ Upstream commit 9145736d4862145684009d6a72a6e61324a9439e ]
    
    1. For an IPv4 ping socket, ping_check_bind_addr does not check
       the family of the socket address that's passed in. Instead,
       make it behave like inet_bind, which enforces either that the
       address family is AF_INET, or that the family is AF_UNSPEC and
       the address is 0.0.0.0.
    2. For an IPv6 ping socket, ping_check_bind_addr returns EINVAL
       if the socket family is not AF_INET6. Return EAFNOSUPPORT
       instead, for consistency with inet6_bind.
    3. Make ping_v4_sendmsg and ping_v6_sendmsg return EAFNOSUPPORT
       instead of EINVAL if an incorrect socket address structure is
       passed in.
    4. Make IPv6 ping sockets be IPv6-only. The code does not support
       IPv4, and it cannot easily be made to support IPv4 because
       the protocol numbers for ICMP and ICMPv6 are different. This
       makes connect(::ffff:192.0.2.1) fail with EAFNOSUPPORT instead
       of making the socket unusable.
    
    Among other things, this fixes an oops that can be triggered by:
    
        int s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_ICMP);
        struct sockaddr_in6 sin6 = {
            .sin6_family = AF_INET6,
            .sin6_addr = in6addr_any,
        };
        bind(s, (struct sockaddr *) &sin6, sizeof(sin6));

    udp: only allow UFO for packets from SOCK_DGRAM sockets
    
    [ Upstream commit acf8dd0a9d0b9e4cdb597c2f74802f79c699e802 ]
    
    If an over-MTU UDP datagram is sent through a SOCK_RAW socket to a
    UFO-capable device, ip_ufo_append_data() sets skb->ip_summed to
    CHECKSUM_PARTIAL unconditionally as all GSO code assumes transport layer
    checksum is to be computed on segmentation. However, in this case,
    skb->csum_start and skb->csum_offset are never set as raw socket
    transmit path bypasses udp_send_skb() where they are usually set. As a
    result, driver may access invalid memory when trying to calculate the
    checksum and store the result (as observed in virtio_net driver).
    
    Moreover, the very idea of modifying the userspace provided UDP header
    is IMHO against raw socket semantics (I wasn't able to find a document
    clearly stating this or the opposite, though). And while allowing
    CHECKSUM_NONE in the UFO case would be more efficient, it would be a bit
    too intrusive change just to handle a corner case like this. Therefore
    disallowing UFO for packets from SOCK_DGRAM seems to be the best option.

    macvtap: make sure neighbour code can push ethernet header
    
    [ Upstream commit 2f1d8b9e8afa5a833d96afcd23abcb8cdf8d83ab ]
    
    Brian reported crashes using IPv6 traffic with macvtap/veth combo.
    
    I tracked the crashes in neigh_hh_output()
    
    -> memcpy(skb->data - HH_DATA_MOD, hh->hh_data, HH_DATA_MOD);
    
    Neighbour code assumes headroom to push Ethernet header is
    at least 16 bytes.
    
    It appears macvtap has only 14 bytes available on arches
    where NET_IP_ALIGN is 0 (like x86)
    
    Effect is a corruption of 2 bytes right before skb->head,
    and possible crashes if accessing non existing memory.
    
    This fix should also increase IPv4 performance, as paranoid code
    in ip_finish_output2() wont have to call skb_realloc_headroom()

    macvtap: limit head length of skb allocated
    
    commit 16a3fa28630331e28208872fa5341ce210b901c7 upstream.
    
    We currently use hdr_len as a hint of head length which is advertised by
    guest. But when guest advertise a very big value, it can lead to an 64K+
    allocating of kmalloc() which has a very high possibility of failure when host
    memory is fragmented or under heavy stress. The huge hdr_len also reduce the
    effect of zerocopy or even disable if a gso skb is linearized in guest.
    
    To solves those issues, this patch introduces an upper limit (PAGE_SIZE) of the
    head, which guarantees an order 0 allocation each time.

    rtnetlink: call ->dellink on failure when ->newlink exists
    
    [ Upstream commit 7afb8886a05be68e376655539a064ec672de8a8e ]
    
    Ignacy reported that when eth0 is down and add a vlan device

    We will get a refcount leak:
    
      unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0.1 to become free. Usage count = 2
    
    The problem is when rtnl_configure_link() fails in rtnl_newlink(),
    we simply call unregister_device(), but for stacked device like vlan,
    we almost do nothing when we unregister the upper device, more work
    is done when we unregister the lower device, so call its ->dellink().

    ping: Fix race in free in receive path
    
    [ Upstream commit fc752f1f43c1c038a2c6ae58cc739ebb5953ccb0 ]
    
    An exception is seen in ICMP ping receive path where the skb
    destructor sock_rfree() tries to access a freed socket. This happens
    because ping_rcv() releases socket reference with sock_put() and this
    internally frees up the socket. Later icmp_rcv() will try to free the
    skb and as part of this, skb destructor is called and which leads
    to a kernel panic as the socket is freed already in ping_rcv().

    net: rps: fix cpu unplug
    
    [ Upstream commit ac64da0b83d82abe62f78b3d0e21cca31aea24fa ]
    
    softnet_data.input_pkt_queue is protected by a spinlock that
    we must hold when transferring packets from victim queue to an active
    one. This is because other cpus could still be trying to enqueue packets
    into victim queue.
    
    A second problem is that when we transfert the NAPI poll_list from
    victim to current cpu, we absolutely need to special case the percpu
    backlog, because we do not want to add complex locking to protect
    process_queue : Only owner cpu is allowed to manipulate it, unless cpu
    is offline.
    
    Based on initial patch from Prasad Sodagudi & Subash Abhinov
    Kasiviswanathan.
    
    This version is better because we do not slow down packet processing,
    only make migration safer.

    ip: zero sockaddr returned on error queue
    
    [ Upstream commit f812116b174e59a350acc8e4856213a166a91222 ]
    
    The sockaddr is returned in IP(V6)_RECVERR as part of errhdr. That
    structure is defined and allocated on the stack as
    
        struct {
                struct sock_extended_err ee;
                struct sockaddr_in(6)    offender;
        } errhdr;
    
    The second part is only initialized for certain SO_EE_ORIGIN values.
    Always initialize it completely.
    
    An MTU exceeded error on a SOCK_RAW/IPPROTO_RAW is one example that
    would return uninitialized bytes.

    net:socket: set msg_namelen to 0 if msg_name is passed as NULL in msghdr struct from userland.
    
    commit 6a2a2b3ae0759843b22c929881cc184b00cc63ff upstream.
    
    Linux manpage for recvmsg and sendmsg calls does not explicitly mention setting msg_namelen to 0 when
    msg_name passed set as NULL. When developers don't set msg_namelen member in msghdr, it might contain garbage
    value which will fail the validation check and sendmsg and recvmsg calls from kernel will return EINVAL. This will
    break old binaries and any code for which there is no access to source code.
    To fix this, we set msg_namelen to 0 when msg_name is passed as NULL from userland.

    commit 223b02d923ecd7c84cf9780bb3686f455d279279 upstream.
    
    "len" contains sizeof(nf_ct_ext) and size of extensions. In a worst
    case it can contain all extensions. Bellow you can find sizes for all
    types of extensions. Their sum is definitely bigger than 256.
    
    nf_ct_ext_types[0]->len = 24
    nf_ct_ext_types[1]->len = 32
    nf_ct_ext_types[2]->len = 24
    nf_ct_ext_types[3]->len = 32
    nf_ct_ext_types[4]->len = 152
    nf_ct_ext_types[5]->len = 2
    nf_ct_ext_types[6]->len = 16
    nf_ct_ext_types[7]->len = 8
    
    I have seen "len" up to 280 and my host has crashes w/o this patch.
    
    The right way to fix this problem is reducing the size of the ecache
    extension (4) and Florian is going to do this, but these changes will
    be quite large to be appropriate for a stable tree.

    xen-netfront: transmit fully GSO-sized packets
    
    commit 0c36820e2ab7d943ab1188230fdf2149826d33c0 upstream.
    
    xen-netfront limits transmitted skbs to be at most 44 segments in size. However,
    GSO permits up to 65536 bytes, which means a maximum of 45 segments of 1448
    bytes each. This slight reduction in the size of packets means a slight loss in
    efficiency.
    
    Since c/s 9ecd1a75d, xen-netfront sets gso_max_size to
        XEN_NETIF_MAX_TX_SIZE - MAX_TCP_HEADER,
    where XEN_NETIF_MAX_TX_SIZE is 65535 bytes.
    
    The calculation used by tcp_tso_autosize (and also tcp_xmit_size_goal since c/s
    6c09fa09d) in determining when to split an skb into two is
        sk->sk_gso_max_size - 1 - MAX_TCP_HEADER.
    
    So the maximum permitted size of an skb is calculated to be
        (XEN_NETIF_MAX_TX_SIZE - MAX_TCP_HEADER) - 1 - MAX_TCP_HEADER.
    
    Intuitively, this looks like the wrong formula -- we don't need two TCP headers.
    Instead, there is no need to deviate from the default gso_max_size of 65536 as
    this already accommodates the size of the header.
    
    Currently, the largest skb transmitted by netfront is 63712 bytes (44 segments
    of 1448 bytes each), as observed via tcpdump. This patch makes netfront send
    skbs of up to 65160 bytes (45 segments of 1448 bytes each).
    
    Similarly, the maximum allowable mtu does not need to subtract MAX_TCP_HEADER as
    it relates to the size of the whole packet, including the header.

    commit 8494057ab5e40df590ef6ef7d66324d3ae33356b upstream.
    
    Properly verify that the resulting page aligned end address is larger
    than both the start address and the length of the memory area requested.
    
    Both the start and length arguments for ib_umem_get are controlled by
    the user. A misbehaving user can provide values which will cause an
    integer overflow when calculating the page aligned end address.
    
    This overflow can cause also miscalculation of the number of pages
    mapped, and additional logic issues.

    mac80211: fix RX A-MPDU session reorder timer deletion
    
    commit 788211d81bfdf9b6a547d0530f206ba6ee76b107 upstream.
    
    There's an issue with the way the RX A-MPDU reorder timer is
    deleted that can cause a kernel crash like this:
    
     * tid_rx is removed - call_rcu(ieee80211_free_tid_rx)
     * station is destroyed
     * reorder timer fires before ieee80211_free_tid_rx() runs,
       accessing the station, thus potentially crashing due to
       the use-after-free
    
    The station deletion is protected by synchronize_net(), but
    that isn't enough -- ieee80211_free_tid_rx() need not have
    run when that returns (it deletes the timer.) We could use
    rcu_barrier() instead of synchronize_net(), but that's much
    more expensive.
    
    Instead, to fix this, add a field tracking that the session
    is being deleted. In this case, the only re-arming of the
    timer happens with the reorder spinlock held, so make that
    code not rearm it if the session is being deleted and also
    delete the timer after setting that field. This ensures the
    timer cannot fire after ___ieee80211_stop_rx_ba_session()
    returns, which fixes the problem.

    x86/reboot: Add ASRock Q1900DC-ITX mainboard reboot quirk
    
    commit 80313b3078fcd2ca51970880d90757f05879a193 upstream.
    
    The ASRock Q1900DC-ITX mainboard (Baytrail-D) hangs randomly in
    both BIOS and UEFI mode while rebooting unless reboot=pci is
    used. Add a quirk to reboot via the pci method.
    
    The problem is very intermittent and hard to debug, it might succeed
    rebooting just fine 40 times in a row - but fails half a dozen times
    the next day. It seems to be slightly less common in BIOS CSM mode
    than native UEFI (with the CSM disabled), but it does happen in either
    mode. Since I've started testing this patch in late january, rebooting
    has been 100% reliable.
    
    Most of the time it already hangs during POST, but occasionally it
    might even make it through the bootloader and the kernel might even
    start booting, but then hangs before the mode switch. The same symptoms
    occur with grub-efi, gummiboot and grub-pc, just as well as (at least)
    kernel 3.16-3.19 and 4.0-rc6 (I haven't tried older kernels than 3.16).
    Upgrading to the most current mainboard firmware of the ASRock
    Q1900DC-ITX, version 1.20, does not improve the situation.
    
    ( Searching the web seems to suggest that other Bay Trail-D mainboards
      might be affected as well. )

    x86/reboot: Remove VersaLogic Menlow reboot quirk
    
    commit e6d36a653becc7bbc643c399a77882e02bf552cb upstream.
    
    This commit removes the reboot quirk originally added by commit
    e19e074 ("x86: Fix reboot problem on VersaLogic Menlow boards").
    
    Testing with a VersaLogic Ocelot (VL-EPMs-21a rev 1.00 w/ BIOS
    6.5.102) revealed the following regarding the reboot hang
    problem:
    
    - v2.6.37 reboot=bios was needed.
    
    - v2.6.38-rc1: behavior changed, reboot=acpi is needed,
      reboot=kbd and reboot=bios results in system hang.
    
    - v2.6.38: VersaLogic patch (e19e074 "x86: Fix reboot problem on
      VersaLogic Menlow boards") was applied prior to v2.6.38-rc7.  This
      patch sets a quirk for VersaLogic Menlow boards that forces the use
      of reboot=bios, which doesn't work anymore.
    
    - v3.2: It seems that commit 660e34c ("x86: Reorder reboot method
      preferences") changed the default reboot method to acpi prior to
      v3.0-rc1, which means the default behavior is appropriate for the
      Ocelot.  No VersaLogic quirk is required.
    
    The Ocelot board used for testing can successfully reboot w/out
    having to pass any reboot= arguments for all 3 current versions
    of the BIOS.

    hfsplus: fix B-tree corruption after insertion at position 0
    
    commit 98cf21c61a7f5419d82f847c4d77bf6e96a76f5f upstream.
    
    Fix B-tree corruption when a new record is inserted at position 0 in the
    node in hfs_brec_insert().  In this case a hfs_brec_update_parent() is
    called to update the parent index node (if exists) and it is passed
    hfs_find_data with a search_key containing a newly inserted key instead
    of the key to be updated.  This results in an inconsistent index node.
    The bug reproduces on my machine after an extents overflow record for
    the catalog file (CNID=4) is inserted into the extents overflow B-tree.
    Because of a low (reserved) value of CNID=4, it has to become the first
    record in the first leaf node.
    
    The resulting first leaf node is correct:
    
      ----------------------------------------------------
      | key0.CNID=4 | key1.CNID=123 | key2.CNID=456, ... |
      ----------------------------------------------------
    
    But the parent index key0 still contains the previous key CNID=123:
    
      -----------------------
      | key0.CNID=123 | ... |
      -----------------------
    
    A change in hfs_brec_insert() makes hfs_brec_update_parent() work
    correctly by preventing it from getting fd->record=-1 value from
    __hfs_brec_find().
    
    Along the way, I removed duplicate code with unification of the if
    condition.  The resulting code is equivalent to the original code
    because node is never 0.
    
    Also hfs_brec_update_parent() will now return an error after getting a
    negative fd->record value.  However, the return value of
    hfs_brec_update_parent() is not checked anywhere in the file and I'm
    leaving it unchanged by this patch.  brec.c lacks error checking after
    some other calls too, but this issue is of less importance than the one
    being fixed by this patch.

    mm: fix anon_vma->degree underflow in anon_vma endless growing prevention
    
    commit 3fe89b3e2a7bbf3e97657104b9b33a9d81b950b3 upstream.
    
    I have constantly stumbled upon "kernel BUG at mm/rmap.c:399!" after
    upgrading to 3.19 and had no luck with 4.0-rc1 neither.
    
    So, after looking into new logic introduced by commit 7a3ef208e662 ("mm:
    prevent endless growth of anon_vma hierarchy"), I found chances are that
    unlink_anon_vmas() is called without incrementing dst->anon_vma->degree
    in anon_vma_clone() due to allocation failure.  If dst->anon_vma is not
    NULL in error path, its degree will be incorrectly decremented in
    unlink_anon_vmas() and eventually underflow when exiting as a result of
    another call to unlink_anon_vmas().  That's how "kernel BUG at
    mm/rmap.c:399!" is triggered for me.
    
    This patch fixes the underflow by dropping dst->anon_vma when allocation
    fails.  It's safe to do so regardless of original value of dst->anon_vma
    because dst->anon_vma doesn't have valid meaning if anon_vma_clone()
    fails.  Besides, callers don't care dst->anon_vma in such case neither.
    
    Also suggested by Michal Hocko, we can clean up vma_adjust() a bit as
    anon_vma_clone() now does the work.

    usb: xhci: apply XHCI_AVOID_BEI quirk to all Intel xHCI controllers
    
    commit 227a4fd801c8a9fa2c4700ab98ec1aec06e3b44d upstream.
    
    When a device with an isochronous endpoint is plugged into the Intel
    xHCI host controller, and the driver submits multiple frames per URB,
    the xHCI driver will set the Block Event Interrupt (BEI) flag on all
    but the last TD for the URB. This causes the host controller to place
    an event on the event ring, but not send an interrupt. When the last
    TD for the URB completes, BEI is cleared, and we get an interrupt for
    the whole URB.
    
    However, under Intel xHCI host controllers, if the event ring is full
    of events from transfers with BEI set,  an "Event Ring is Full" event
    will be posted to the last entry of the event ring,  but no interrupt
    is generated. Host will cease all transfer and command executions and
    wait until software completes handling the pending events in the event
    ring.  That means xHC stops, but event of "event ring is full" is not
    notified. As the result, the xHC looks like dead to user.
    
    This patch is to apply XHCI_AVOID_BEI quirk to Intel xHC devices. And
    it should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, that contains the
    commit 69e848c2090a ("Intel xhci: Support EHCI/xHCI port switching.").

    usb: xhci: handle Config Error Change (CEC) in xhci driver
    
    commit 9425183d177aa4a2f09d01a74925124f0778b595 upstream.
    
    Linux xHCI driver doesn't report and handle port cofig error change.
    If Port Configure Error for root hub port occurs, CEC bit in PORTSC
    would be set by xHC and remains 1. This happends when the root port
    fails to configure its link partner, e.g. the port fails to exchange
    port capabilities information using Port Capability LMPs.
    
    Then the Port Status Change Events will be blocked until all status
    change bits(CEC is one of the change bits) are cleared('0') (refer to
    xHCI spec 4.19.2). Otherwise, the port status change event for this
    root port will not be generated anymore, then root port would look
    like dead for user and can't be recovered until a Host Controller
    Reset(HCRST).
    
    This patch is to check CEC bit in PORTSC in xhci_get_port_status()
    and set a Config Error in the return status if CEC is set. This will
    cause a ClearPortFeature request, where CEC bit is cleared in
    xhci_clear_port_change_bit().

    writeback: fix possible underflow in write bandwidth calculation

    2f800fbd777b ("writeback: fix dirtied pages accounting on redirty")
    introduced account_page_redirty() which reverts stat updates for a
    redirtied page, making BDI_DIRTIED no longer monotonically increasing.
    
    bdi_update_write_bandwidth() uses the delta in BDI_DIRTIED as the
    basis for bandwidth calculation.  While unlikely, since the above
    patch, the newer value may be lower than the recorded past value and
    underflow the bandwidth calculation leading to a wild result.
    
    Fix it by subtracing min of the old and new values when calculating
    delta.  AFAIK, there hasn't been any report of it happening but the
    resulting erratic behavior would be non-critical and temporary, so
    it's possible that the issue is happening without being reported.  The
    risk of the fix is very low, so tagged for -stable.

    sched: Fix RLIMIT_RTTIME when PI-boosting to RT
    
    commit 746db9443ea57fd9c059f62c4bfbf41cf224fe13 upstream.
    
    When non-realtime tasks get priority-inheritance boosted to a realtime
    scheduling class, RLIMIT_RTTIME starts to apply to them. However, the
    counter used for checking this (the same one used for SCHED_RR
    timeslices) was not getting reset. This meant that tasks running with a
    non-realtime scheduling class which are repeatedly boosted to a realtime
    one, but never block while they are running realtime, eventually hit the
    timeout without ever running for a time over the limit. This patch
    resets the realtime timeslice counter when un-PI-boosting from an RT to
    a non-RT scheduling class.
    
    I have some test code with two threads and a shared PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT
    mutex which induces priority boosting and spins while boosted that gets
    killed by a SIGXCPU on non-fixed kernels but doesn't with this patch
    applied. It happens much faster with a CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT kernel, and
    does happen eventually with PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY kernels.

    perf: Fix irq_work 'tail' recursion
    
    commit d525211f9d1be8b523ec7633f080f2116f5ea536 upstream.
    
    Vince reported a watchdog lockup like:
    
            [<ffffffff8115e114>] perf_tp_event+0xc4/0x210
            [<ffffffff810b4f8a>] perf_trace_lock+0x12a/0x160

            [<ffffffff810196af>] smp_trace_irq_work_interrupt+0x3f/0xc0
            [<ffffffff816c99bd>] trace_irq_work_interrupt+0x6d/0x80
    
    Which is caused by an irq_work generating new irq_work and therefore
    not allowing forward progress.
    
    This happens because processing the perf irq_work triggers another
    perf event (tracepoint stuff) which in turn generates an irq_work ad
    infinitum.
    
    Avoid this by raising the recursion counter in the irq_work -- which
    effectively disables all software events (including tracepoints) from
    actually triggering again.

    cifs: fix use-after-free bug in find_writable_file
    
    commit e1e9bda22d7ddf88515e8fe401887e313922823e upstream.
    
    Under intermittent network outages, find_writable_file() is susceptible
    to the following race condition, which results in a user-after-free in
    the cifs_writepages code-path:
    
    Thread 1                                        Thread 2
    ========                                        ========
    
    inv_file = NULL
    refind = 0
    spin_lock(&cifs_file_list_lock)
    
    // invalidHandle found on openFileList
    
    inv_file = open_file
    // inv_file->count currently 1
    
    cifsFileInfo_get(inv_file)
    // inv_file->count = 2
    
    spin_unlock(&cifs_file_list_lock);
    
    cifs_reopen_file()                            cifs_close()
    // fails (rc != 0)                            ->cifsFileInfo_put()
                                           spin_lock(&cifs_file_list_lock)
                                           // inv_file->count = 1
                                           spin_unlock(&cifs_file_list_lock)
    
    spin_lock(&cifs_file_list_lock);
    list_move_tail(&inv_file->flist,
          &cifs_inode->openFileList);
    spin_unlock(&cifs_file_list_lock);
    
    cifsFileInfo_put(inv_file);
    ->spin_lock(&cifs_file_list_lock)
    
      // inv_file->count = 0
      list_del(&cifs_file->flist);
      // cleanup!!
      kfree(cifs_file);
    
      spin_unlock(&cifs_file_list_lock);
    
    spin_lock(&cifs_file_list_lock);
    ++refind;
    // refind = 1
    goto refind_writable;
    
    At this point we loop back through with an invalid inv_file pointer
    and a refind value of 1. On second pass, inv_file is not overwritten on
    openFileList traversal, and is subsequently dereferenced.

    net: compat: Update get_compat_msghdr() to match copy_msghdr_from_user() behaviour
    
    commit 91edd096e224941131f896b86838b1e59553696a upstream.
    
    Commit db31c55a6fb2 (net: clamp ->msg_namelen instead of returning an
    error) introduced the clamping of msg_namelen when the unsigned value
    was larger than sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage). This caused a
    msg_namelen of -1 to be valid. The native code was subsequently fixed by
    commit dbb490b96584 (net: socket: error on a negative msg_namelen).
    
    In addition, the native code sets msg_namelen to 0 when msg_name is
    NULL. This was done in commit (6a2a2b3ae075 net:socket: set msg_namelen
    to 0 if msg_name is passed as NULL in msghdr struct from userland) and
    subsequently updated by 08adb7dabd48 (fold verify_iovec() into
    copy_msghdr_from_user()).
    
    This patch brings the get_compat_msghdr() in line with
    copy_msghdr_from_user().

    net: ethernet: pcnet32: Setup the SRAM and NOUFLO on Am79C97{3, 5}
    
    commit 87f966d97b89774162df04d2106c6350c8fe4cb3 upstream.
    
    On a MIPS Malta board, tons of fifo underflow errors have been observed
    when using u-boot as bootloader instead of YAMON. The reason for that
    is that YAMON used to set the pcnet device to SRAM mode but u-boot does
    not. As a result, the default Tx threshold (64 bytes) is now too small to
    keep the fifo relatively used and it can result to Tx fifo underflow errors.
    As a result of which, it's best to setup the SRAM on supported controllers
    so we can always use the NOUFLO bit.

    iio: core: Fix double free.
    
    commit c1b03ab5e886760bdd38c9c7a27af149046ffe01 upstream.
    
    When an error occurred during event registration memory was freed twice
    resulting in kernel memory corruption and a crash in unrelated code.
    
    The problem was caused by
            iio_device_unregister_eventset()
            iio_device_unregister_sysfs()
    
    being called twice, once on the error path and then
    again via iio_dev_release().
    
    Fix this by making these two functions idempotent so they
    may be called multiple times.

    writeback: add missing INITIAL_JIFFIES init in global_update_bandwidth()
    
    commit 7d70e15480c0450d2bfafaad338a32e884fc215e upstream.
    
    global_update_bandwidth() uses static variable update_time as the
    timestamp for the last update but forgets to initialize it to
    INITIALIZE_JIFFIES.
    
    This means that global_dirty_limit will be 5 mins into the future on
    32bit and some large amount jiffies into the past on 64bit.  This
    isn't critical as the only effect is that global_dirty_limit won't be
    updated for the first 5 mins after booting on 32bit machines,
    especially given the auxiliary nature of global_dirty_limit's role -
    protecting against global dirty threshold's sudden dips; however, it
    does lead to unintended suboptimal behavior.  Fix it.

    commit 496fcc294daab18799e190c0264863d653588d1f upstream.
    
    As HT/VHT depend heavily on QoS/WMM, it's not a good idea to
    let userspace add clients that have HT/VHT but not QoS/WMM.
    Since it does so in certain cases we've observed (client is
    using HT IEs but not QoS/WMM) just ignore the HT/VHT info at
    this point and don't pass it down to the drivers which might
    unconditionally use it.

    crypto: aesni - fix memory usage in GCM decryption
    
    commit ccfe8c3f7e52ae83155cb038753f4c75b774ca8a upstream.
    
    The kernel crypto API logic requires the caller to provide the
    length of (ciphertext || authentication tag) as cryptlen for the
    AEAD decryption operation. Thus, the cipher implementation must
    calculate the size of the plaintext output itself and cannot simply use
    cryptlen.
    
    The RFC4106 GCM decryption operation tries to overwrite cryptlen memory
    in req->dst. As the destination buffer for decryption only needs to hold
    the plaintext memory but cryptlen references the input buffer holding
    (ciphertext || authentication tag), the assumption of the destination
    buffer length in RFC4106 GCM operation leads to a too large size. This
    patch simply uses the already calculated plaintext size.
    
    In addition, this patch fixes the offset calculation of the AAD buffer
    pointer: as mentioned before, cryptlen already includes the size of the
    tag. Thus, the tag does not need to be added. With the addition, the AAD
    will be written beyond the already allocated buffer.
    
    Note, this fixes a kernel crash that can be triggered from user space
    via AF_ALG(aead) -- simply use the libkcapi test application
    from [1] and update it to use rfc4106-gcm-aes.
    
    Using [1], the changes were tested using CAVS vectors to demonstrate
    that the crypto operation still delivers the right results.

    nilfs2: fix deadlock of segment constructor during recovery
    
    commit 283ee1482f349d6c0c09dfb725db5880afc56813 upstream.
    
    According to a report from Yuxuan Shui, nilfs2 in kernel 3.19 got stuck
    during recovery at mount time.  The code path that caused the deadlock was
    as follows:
    
      nilfs_fill_super()
        load_nilfs()
          nilfs_salvage_orphan_logs()
            * Do roll-forwarding, attach segment constructor for recovery,
              and kick it.
    
            nilfs_segctor_thread()
              nilfs_segctor_thread_construct()
               * A lock is held with nilfs_transaction_lock()
                 nilfs_segctor_do_construct()
                   nilfs_segctor_drop_written_files()
                     iput()
                       iput_final()
                         write_inode_now()
                           writeback_single_inode()
                             __writeback_single_inode()
                               do_writepages()
                                 nilfs_writepage()
                                   nilfs_construct_dsync_segment()
                                     nilfs_transaction_lock() --> deadlock
    
    This can happen if commit 7ef3ff2fea8b ("nilfs2: fix deadlock of segment
    constructor over I_SYNC flag") is applied and roll-forward recovery was
    performed at mount time.  The roll-forward recovery can happen if datasync
    write is done and the file system crashes immediately after that.  For
    instance, we can reproduce the issue with the following steps:
    
     < nilfs2 is mounted on /nilfs (device: /dev/sdb1) >
     # dd if=/dev/zero of=/nilfs/test bs=4k count=1 && sync
     # dd if=/dev/zero of=/nilfs/test conv=notrunc oflag=dsync bs=4k
     count=1 && reboot -nfh
     < the system will immediately reboot >
     # mount -t nilfs2 /dev/sdb1 /nilfs
    
    The deadlock occurs because iput() can run segment constructor through
    writeback_single_inode() if MS_ACTIVE flag is not set on sb->s_flags.  The
    above commit changed segment constructor so that it calls iput()
    asynchronously for inodes with i_nlink == 0, but that change was
    imperfect.
    
    This fixes the another deadlock by deferring iput() in segment constructor
    even for the case that mount is not finished, that is, for the case that
    MS_ACTIVE flag is not set.

    ftrace: Fix ftrace enable ordering of sysctl ftrace_enabled
    
    commit 524a38682573b2e15ab6317ccfe50280441514be upstream.
    
    Some archs (specifically PowerPC), are sensitive with the ordering of
    the enabling of the calls to function tracing and setting of the
    function to use to be traced.
    
    That is, update_ftrace_function() sets what function the ftrace_caller
    trampoline should call. Some archs require this to be set before
    calling ftrace_run_update_code().
    
    Another bug was discovered, that ftrace_startup_sysctl() called
    ftrace_run_update_code() directly. If the function the ftrace_caller
    trampoline changes, then it will not be updated. Instead a call
    to ftrace_startup_enable() should be called because it tests to see
    if the callback changed since the code was disabled, and will
    tell the arch to update appropriately. Most archs do not need this
    notification, but PowerPC does.
    
    The problem could be seen by the following commands:
    
     # echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled
     # echo function > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
     # echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled
     # cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace
    
    The trace will show that function tracing was not active.

    ftrace: Fix en(dis)able graph caller when en(dis)abling record via sysctl
    
    commit 1619dc3f8f555ee1cdd3c75db3885d5715442b12 upstream.
    
    When ftrace is enabled globally through the proc interface, we must check if
    ftrace_graph_active is set. If it is set, then we should also pass the
    FTRACE_START_FUNC_RET command to ftrace_run_update_code(). Similarly, when
    ftrace is disabled globally through the proc interface, we must check if
    ftrace_graph_active is set. If it is set, then we should also pass the
    FTRACE_STOP_FUNC_RET command to ftrace_run_update_code().
    
    Consider the following situation.
    
     # echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled
    
    After this ftrace_enabled = 0.
    
     # echo function_graph > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
    
    Since ftrace_enabled = 0, ftrace_enable_ftrace_graph_caller() is never
    called.
    
     # echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled
    
    Now ftrace_enabled will be set to true, but still
    ftrace_enable_ftrace_graph_caller() will not be called, which is not
    desired.
    
    Further if we execute the following after this:
      # echo nop > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
    
    Now since ftrace_enabled is set it will call
    ftrace_disable_ftrace_graph_caller(), which causes a kernel warning on
    the ARM platform.
    
    On the ARM platform, when ftrace_enable_ftrace_graph_caller() is called,
    it checks whether the old instruction is a nop or not. If it's not a nop,
    then it returns an error. If it is a nop then it replaces instruction at
    that address with a branch to ftrace_graph_caller.
    ftrace_disable_ftrace_graph_caller() behaves just the opposite. Therefore,
    if generic ftrace code ever calls either ftrace_enable_ftrace_graph_caller()
    or ftrace_disable_ftrace_graph_caller() consecutively two times in a row,
    then it will return an error, which will cause the generic ftrace code to
    raise a warning.
    
    Note, x86 does not have an issue with this because the architecture
    specific code for ftrace_enable_ftrace_graph_caller() and
    ftrace_disable_ftrace_graph_caller() does not check the previous state,
    and calling either of these functions twice in a row has no ill effect.

    When accessing CAN network interfaces with AF_PACKET sockets e.g. by dhclient
    this can lead to a skb_under_panic due to missing skb initialisations.
    
    Add the missing initialisations at the CAN skbuff creation times on driver

    commit dc5465dc8a6d5cae8a0e1d8826bdcb2e4cb261ab upstream.
    
    On the X1 Carbon 3rd gen (with a 2015 broadwell cpu), the physical middle
    button of the trackstick (attached to the touchpad serio device, of course)
    seems to get lost.
    
    Actually, the touchpads reports 3 extra buttons, which falls in the switch
    below to the '2' case. Let's handle the case of odd numbers also, so that
    the middle button finds its way back.

    It's directly caused by 89d3cf6 [SCSI] libsas: add mutex for SMP task
    execution, but shows a deeper cause: expander functions expect to be able to
    cast to and treat domain devices as expanders.  The correct fix is to only do
    expander discover when we know we've got an expander device to avoid wrongly
    casting a non-expander device.

    x86/vdso: Fix the build on GCC5
    
    commit e893286918d2cde3a94850d8f7101cd1039e0c62 upstream.
    
    On gcc5 the kernel does not link:
    
      ld: .eh_frame_hdr table[4] FDE at 0000000000000648 overlaps table[5] FDE at 0000000000000670.
    
    Because prior GCC versions always emitted NOPs on ALIGN directives, but
    gcc5 started omitting them.
    
    .LSTARTFDEDLSI1 says:
    
            /* HACK: The dwarf2 unwind routines will subtract 1 from the
               return address to get an address in the middle of the
               presumed call instruction.  Since we didn't get here via
               a call, we need to include the nop before the real start
               to make up for it.  */
            .long .LSTART_sigreturn-1-.     /* PC-relative start address */
    
    But commit 69d0627a7f6e ("x86 vDSO: reorder vdso32 code") from 2.6.25
    replaced .org __kernel_vsyscall+32,0x90 by ALIGN right before
    __kernel_sigreturn.
    
    Of course, ALIGN need not generate any NOP in there. Esp. gcc5 collapses
    vclock_gettime.o and int80.o together with no generated NOPs as "ALIGN".
    
    So fix this by adding to that point at least a single NOP and make the
    function ALIGN possibly with more NOPs then.
    
    Kudos for reporting and diagnosing should go to Richard.

    commit da293700568ed3d96fcf062ac15d7d7c41377f11 upstream.
    
    EEH recovery for bnx2x based adapters is not reliable on all Power
    systems using the default hot reset, which can result in an
    unrecoverable EEH error. Forcing the use of fundamental reset
    during EEH recovery fixes this.

    mac80211: disable u-APSD queues by default
    
    commit aa75ebc275b2a91b193654a177daf900ad6703f0 upstream.
    
    Some APs experience problems when working with
    U-APSD. Decreasing the probability of that
    happening by using legacy mode for all ACs but VO
    isn't enough.
    
    Cisco 4410N originally forced us to enable VO by
    default only because it treated non-VO ACs as
    legacy.
    
    However some APs (notably Netgear R7000) silently
    reclassify packets to different ACs. Since u-APSD
    ACs require trigger frames for frame retrieval
    clients would never see some frames (e.g. ARP
    responses) or would fetch them accidentally after
    a long time.
    
    It makes little sense to enable u-APSD queues by
    default because it needs userspace applications to
    be aware of it to actually take advantage of the
    possible additional powersavings. Implicitly
    depending on driver autotrigger frame support
    doesn't make much sense.

    spi: dw: revisit FIFO size detection again
    
    commit 9d239d353c319f9ff884c287ce47feb7cdf60ddc upstream.
    
    The commit d297933cc7fc (spi: dw: Fix detecting FIFO depth) tries to fix the
    logic of the FIFO detection based on the description on the comments. However,
    there is a slight difference between numbers in TX Level and TX FIFO size.
    
    So, by specification the FIFO size would be in a range 2-256 bytes. From TX
    Level prospective it means we can set threshold in the range 0-(FIFO size - 1)
    bytes. Hence there are currently two issues:
      a) FIFO size 2 bytes is actually skipped since TX Level is 1 bit and could be
         either 0 or 1 byte;
      b) FIFO size is incorrectly decreased by 1 which already done by meaning of
         TX Level register.
    
    This patch fixes it eventually right.

    commit 528c943f3bb919aef75ab2fff4f00176f09a4019 upstream.
    
    ip_vs_conn_fill_param_sync() gets in param.pe a module
    reference for persistence engine from __ip_vs_pe_getbyname()
    but forgets to put it. Problem occurs in backup for
    sync protocol v1 (2.6.39).
    
    Also, pe_data usually comes in sync messages for
    connection templates and ip_vs_conn_new() copies
    the pointer only in this case. Make sure pe_data
    is not leaked if it comes unexpectedly for normal
    connections. Leak can happen only if bogus messages
    are sent to backup server.

    commit f01d35a15fa04162a58b95970fc01fa70ec9dacd upstream.
    
    AIO_PREAD requests call ->aio_read() with iovec on caller's stack, so if
    we are going to access it asynchronously, we'd better get ourselves
    a copy - the one on kernel stack of aio_run_iocb() won't be there
    anymore.  function/f_fs.c take care of doing that, legacy/inode.c
    doesn't...

    TTY: fix tty_wait_until_sent on 64-bit machines
    
    commit 79fbf4a550ed6a22e1ae1516113e6c7fa5d56a53 upstream.
    
    Fix overflow bug in tty_wait_until_sent on 64-bit machines, where an
    infinite timeout (0) would be passed to the underlying tty-driver's
    wait_until_sent-operation as a negative timeout (-1), causing it to
    return immediately.
    
    This manifests itself for example as tcdrain() returning immediately,
    drivers not honouring the drain flags when setting terminal attributes,
    or even dropped data on close as a requested infinite closing-wait
    timeout would be ignored.
    
    The first symptom  was reported by Asier LLANO who noted that tcdrain()
    returned prematurely when using the ftdi_sio usb-serial driver.
    
    Fix this by passing 0 rather than MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT (LONG_MAX) to the
    underlying tty driver.
    
    Note that the serial-core wait_until_sent-implementation is not affected
    by this bug due to a lucky chance (comparison to an unsigned maximum
    timeout), and neither is the cyclades one that had an explicit check for
    negative timeouts, but all other tty drivers appear to be affected.

    net: irda: fix wait_until_sent poll timeout
    
    commit 2c3fbe3cf28fbd7001545a92a83b4f8acfd9fa36 upstream.
    
    In case an infinite timeout (0) is requested, the irda wait_until_sent
    implementation would use a zero poll timeout rather than the default
    200ms.
    
    Note that wait_until_sent is currently never called with a 0-timeout
    argument due to a bug in tty_wait_until_sent.

    tty: fix up atime/mtime mess, take four
    
    commit f0bf0bd07943bfde8f5ac39a32664810a379c7d3 upstream.
    
    This problem was taken care of three times already in
    * b0de59b5733d18b0d1974a060860a8b5c1b36a2e (TTY: do not update
      atime/mtime on read/write),
    * 37b7f3c76595e23257f61bd80b223de8658617ee (TTY: fix atime/mtime
      regression), and
    * b0b885657b6c8ef63a46bc9299b2a7715d19acde (tty: fix up atime/mtime
      mess, take three)
    
    But it still misses one point. As John Paul correctly points out, we
    do not care about setting date. If somebody ever changes wall
    time backwards (by mistake for example), tty timestamps are never
    updated until the original wall time passes.
    
    So check the absolute difference of times and if it large than "8
    seconds or so", always update the time. That means we will update
    immediatelly when changing time. Ergo, CAP_SYS_TIME can foul the
    check, but it was always that way.
    
    Thanks John for serving me this so nicely debugged.

    xhci: Workaround for PME stuck issues in Intel xhci
    
    commit b8cb91e058cd0c0f02059c1207293c5b31d350fa upstream.
    
    The xhci in Intel Sunrisepoint and Cherryview platforms need a driver
    workaround for a Stuck PME that might either block PME events in suspend,
    or create spurious PME events preventing runtime suspend.
    
    Workaround is to clear a internal PME flag, BIT(28) in a vendor specific
    PMCTRL register at offset 0x80a4, in both suspend resume callbacks
    
    Without this, xhci connected usb devices might never be able to wake up the
    system from suspend, or prevent device from going to suspend (xhci d3)

    xhci: fix reporting of 0-sized URBs in control endpoint
    
    commit 45ba2154d12fc43b70312198ec47085f10be801a upstream.
    
    When a control transfer has a short data stage, the xHCI controller generates
    two transfer events: a COMP_SHORT_TX event that specifies the untransferred
    amount, and a COMP_SUCCESS event. But when the data stage is not short, only the
    COMP_SUCCESS event occurs. Therefore, xhci-hcd must set urb->actual_length to
    urb->transfer_buffer_length while processing the COMP_SUCCESS event, unless
    urb->actual_length was set already by a previous COMP_SHORT_TX event.
    
    The driver checks this by seeing whether urb->actual_length == 0, but this alone
    is the wrong test, as it is entirely possible for a short transfer to have an
    urb->actual_length = 0.
    
    This patch changes the xhci driver to rely on a new td->urb_length_set flag,
    which is set to true when a COMP_SHORT_TX event is received and the URB length
    updated at that stage.
    
    This fixes a bug which affected the HSO plugin, which relies on URBs with
    urb->actual_length == 0 to halt re-submitting the RX URB in the control
    endpoint.

    x86/asm/entry/64: Remove a bogus 'ret_from_fork' optimization
    
    commit 956421fbb74c3a6261903f3836c0740187cf038b upstream.
    
    'ret_from_fork' checks TIF_IA32 to determine whether 'pt_regs' and
    the related state make sense for 'ret_from_sys_call'.  This is
    entirely the wrong check.  TS_COMPAT would make a little more
    sense, but there's really no point in keeping this optimization
    at all.
    
    This fixes a return to the wrong user CS if we came from int
    0x80 in a 64-bit task.

    eCryptfs: don't pass fs-specific ioctl commands through
    
    commit 6d65261a09adaa374c05de807f73a144d783669e upstream.
    
    eCryptfs can't be aware of what to expect when after passing an
    arbitrary ioctl command through to the lower filesystem. The ioctl
    command may trigger an action in the lower filesystem that is
    incompatible with eCryptfs.
    
    One specific example is when one attempts to use the Btrfs clone
    ioctl command when the source file is in the Btrfs filesystem that
    eCryptfs is mounted on top of and the destination fd is from a new file
    created in the eCryptfs mount. The ioctl syscall incorrectly returns
    success because the command is passed down to Btrfs which thinks that it
    was able to do the clone operation. However, the result is an empty
    eCryptfs file.
    
    This patch allows the trim, {g,s}etflags, and {g,s}etversion ioctl
    commands through and then copies up the inode metadata from the lower
    inode to the eCryptfs inode to catch any changes made to the lower
    inode's metadata. Those five ioctl commands are mostly common across all
    filesystems but the whitelist may need to be further pruned in the
    future.

    nilfs2: fix potential memory overrun on inode
    
    commit 957ed60b53b519064a54988c4e31e0087e47d091 upstream.
    
    Each inode of nilfs2 stores a root node of a b-tree, and it turned out to
    have a memory overrun issue:
    
    Each b-tree node of nilfs2 stores a set of key-value pairs and the number
    of them (in "bn_nchildren" member of nilfs_btree_node struct), as well as
    a few other "bn_*" members.
    
    Since the value of "bn_nchildren" is used for operations on the key-values
    within the b-tree node, it can cause memory access overrun if a large
    number is incorrectly set to "bn_nchildren".
    
    For instance, nilfs_btree_node_lookup() function determines the range of
    binary search with it, and too large "bn_nchildren" leads
    nilfs_btree_node_get_key() in that function to overrun.
    
    As for intermediate b-tree nodes, this is prevented by a sanity check
    performed when each node is read from a drive, however, no sanity check
    has been done for root nodes stored in inodes.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by adding missing sanity check against b-tree
    root nodes so that it's called when on-memory inodes are read from ifile,
    inode metadata file.

    mac80211: Send EAPOL frames at lowest rate
    
    commit 9c1c98a3bb7b7593b60264b9a07e001e68b46697 upstream.
    
    The current minstrel_ht rate control behavior is somewhat optimistic in
    trying to find optimum TX rate. While this is usually fine for normal
    Data frames, there are cases where a more conservative set of retry
    parameters would be beneficial to make the connection more robust.
    
    EAPOL frames are critical to the authentication and especially the
    EAPOL-Key message 4/4 (the last message in the 4-way handshake) is
    important to get through to the AP. If that message is lost, the only
    recovery mechanism in many cases is to reassociate with the AP and start
    from scratch. This can often be avoided by trying to send the frame with
    more conservative rate and/or with more link layer retries.
    
    In most cases, minstrel_ht is currently using the initial EAPOL-Key
    frames for probing higher rates and this results in only five link layer
    transmission attempts (one at high(ish) MCS and four at MCS0). While
    this works with most APs, it looks like there are some deployed APs that
    may have issues with the EAPOL frames using HT MCS immediately after
    association. Similarly, there may be issues in cases where the signal
    strength or radio environment is not good enough to be able to get
    frames through even at couple of MCS 0 tries.
    
    The best approach for this would likely to be to reduce the TX rate for
    the last rate (3rd rate parameter in the set) to a low basic rate (say,
    6 Mbps on 5 GHz and 2 or 5.5 Mbps on 2.4 GHz), but doing that cleanly
    requires some more effort. For now, we can start with a simple one-liner
    that forces the minimum rate to be used for EAPOL frames similarly how
    the TX rate is selected for the IEEE 802.11 Management frames. This does
    result in a small extra latency added to the cases where the AP would be
    able to receive the higher rate, but taken into account how small number
    of EAPOL frames are used, this is likely to be insignificant. A future
    optimization in the minstrel_ht design can also allow this patch to be
    reverted to get back to the more optimized initial TX rate.
    
    It should also be noted that many drivers that do not use minstrel as
    the rate control algorithm are already doing similar workarounds by
    forcing the lowest TX rate to be used for EAPOL frames.

    net: compat: Ignore MSG_CMSG_COMPAT in compat_sys_{send, recv}msg
    
    commit d720d8cec563ce4e4fa44a613d4f2dcb1caf2998 upstream.
    
    With commit a7526eb5d06b (net: Unbreak compat_sys_{send,recv}msg), the
    MSG_CMSG_COMPAT flag is blocked at the compat syscall entry points,
    changing the kernel compat behaviour from the one before the commit it
    was trying to fix (1be374a0518a, net: Block MSG_CMSG_COMPAT in
    send(m)msg and recv(m)msg).
    
    On 32-bit kernels (!CONFIG_COMPAT), MSG_CMSG_COMPAT is 0 and the native
    32-bit sys_sendmsg() allows flag 0x80000000 to be set (it is ignored by
    the kernel). However, on a 64-bit kernel, the compat ABI is different
    with commit a7526eb5d06b.
    
    This patch changes the compat_sys_{send,recv}msg behaviour to the one
    prior to commit 1be374a0518a.
    
    The problem was found running 32-bit LTP (sendmsg01) binary on an arm64
    kernel. Arguably, LTP should not pass 0xffffffff as flags to sendmsg()
    but the general rule is not to break user ABI (even when the user
    behaviour is not entirely sane).

    KVM: emulate: fix CMPXCHG8B on 32-bit hosts
    
    commit 4ff6f8e61eb7f96d3ca535c6d240f863ccd6fb7d upstream.
    
    This has been broken for a long time: it broke first in 2.6.35, then was
    almost fixed in 2.6.36 but this one-liner slipped through the cracks.
    The bug shows up as an infinite loop in Windows 7 (and newer) boot on
    32-bit hosts without EPT.
    
    Windows uses CMPXCHG8B to write to page tables, which causes a
    page fault if running without EPT; the emulator is then called from
    kvm_mmu_page_fault.  The loop then happens if the higher 4 bytes are
    not 0; the common case for this is that the NX bit (bit 63) is 1.

    The gpio_chip operations receive a pointer the gpio_chip struct which is
    contained in the driver's private struct, yet the container_of call in those
    functions point to the mfd struct defined in include/linux/mfd/tps65912.h.

    xfs: ensure truncate forces zeroed blocks to disk
    
    commit 5885ebda878b47c4b4602d4b0410cb4b282af024 upstream.
    
    A new fsync vs power fail test in xfstests indicated that XFS can
    have unreliable data consistency when doing extending truncates that
    require block zeroing. The blocks beyond EOF get zeroed in memory,
    but we never force those changes to disk before we run the
    transaction that extends the file size and exposes those blocks to
    userspace. This can result in the blocks not being correctly zeroed
    after a crash.
    
    Because in-memory behaviour is correct, tools like fsx don't pick up
    any coherency problems - it's not until the filesystem is shutdown
    or the system crashes after writing the truncate transaction to the
    journal but before the zeroed data in the page cache is flushed that
    the issue is exposed.
    
    Fix this by also flushing the dirty data in memory region between
    the old size and new size when we've found blocks that need zeroing
    in the truncate process.

    libceph: fix double __remove_osd() problem
    
    commit 7eb71e0351fbb1b242ae70abb7bb17107fe2f792 upstream.
    
    It turns out it's possible to get __remove_osd() called twice on the
    same OSD.  That doesn't sit well with rb_erase() - depending on the
    shape of the tree we can get a NULL dereference, a soft lockup or
    a random crash at some point in the future as we end up touching freed
    memory.  One scenario that I was able to reproduce is as follows:
    
                <osd3 is idle, on the osd lru list>
    <con reset - osd3>
    con_fault_finish()
      osd_reset()
                                  <osdmap - osd3 down>
                                  ceph_osdc_handle_map()
                                    <takes map_sem>
                                    kick_requests()
                                      <takes request_mutex>
                                      reset_changed_osds()
                                        __reset_osd()
                                          __remove_osd()
                                      <releases request_mutex>
                                    <releases map_sem>
        <takes map_sem>
        <takes request_mutex>
        __kick_osd_requests()
          __reset_osd()
            __remove_osd() <-- !!!
    
    A case can be made that osd refcounting is imperfect and reworking it
    would be a proper resolution, but for now Sage and I decided to fix
    this by adding a safe guard around __remove_osd().

    x86, mm/ASLR: Fix stack randomization on 64-bit systems
    
    commit 4e7c22d447bb6d7e37bfe39ff658486ae78e8d77 upstream.
    
    The issue is that the stack for processes is not properly randomized on
    64 bit architectures due to an integer overflow.
    
    The affected function is randomize_stack_top() in file
    "fs/binfmt_elf.c":
    
      static unsigned long randomize_stack_top(unsigned long stack_top)
      {
               unsigned int random_variable = 0;
    
               if ((current->flags & PF_RANDOMIZE) &&
                       !(current->personality & ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE)) {
                       random_variable = get_random_int() & STACK_RND_MASK;
                       random_variable <<= PAGE_SHIFT;
               }
               return PAGE_ALIGN(stack_top) + random_variable;
               return PAGE_ALIGN(stack_top) - random_variable;
      }
    
    Note that, it declares the "random_variable" variable as "unsigned int".
    Since the result of the shifting operation between STACK_RND_MASK (which
    is 0x3fffff on x86_64, 22 bits) and PAGE_SHIFT (which is 12 on x86_64):
    
              random_variable <<= PAGE_SHIFT;
    
    then the two leftmost bits are dropped when storing the result in the
    "random_variable". This variable shall be at least 34 bits long to hold
    the (22+12) result.
    
    These two dropped bits have an impact on the entropy of process stack.
    Concretely, the total stack entropy is reduced by four: from 2^28 to
    2^30 (One fourth of expected entropy).
    
    This patch restores back the entropy by correcting the types involved
    in the operations in the functions randomize_stack_top() and
    stack_maxrandom_size().
    
    The successful fix can be tested with:
    
      $ for i in `seq 1 10`; do cat /proc/self/maps | grep stack; done
      7ffeda566000-7ffeda587000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      7fff5a332000-7fff5a353000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      7ffcdb7a1000-7ffcdb7c2000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      7ffd5e2c4000-7ffd5e2e5000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      ...
    
    Once corrected, the leading bytes should be between 7ffc and 7fff,
    rather than always being 7fff.

    sched/autogroup: Fix failure to set cpu.rt_runtime_us
    
    commit 1fe89e1b6d270aa0d3452c60d38461ea589594e3 upstream.
    
    Because task_group() uses a cache of autogroup_task_group(), whose
    output depends on sched_class, switching classes can generate
    problems.
    
    In particular, when started as fair, the cache points to the
    autogroup, so when switching to RT the tg_rt_schedulable() test fails
    for every cpu.rt_{runtime,period}_us change because now the autogroup
    has tasks and no runtime.
    
    Furthermore, going back to the previous semantics of varying
    task_group() with sched_class has the down-side that the sched_debug
    output varies as well, even though the task really is in the
    autogroup.
    
    Therefore add an autogroup exception to tg_has_rt_tasks() -- such that
    both (all) task_group() usages in sched/core now have one. And remove
    all the remnants of the variable task_group() output.

    dm snapshot: fix a possible invalid memory access on unload
    
    commit 22aa66a3ee5b61e0f4a0bfeabcaa567861109ec3 upstream.
    
    When the snapshot target is unloaded, snapshot_dtr() waits until
    pending_exceptions_count drops to zero.  Then, it destroys the snapshot.
    Therefore, the function that decrements pending_exceptions_count
    should not touch the snapshot structure after the decrement.
    
    pending_complete() calls free_pending_exception(), which decrements
    pending_exceptions_count, and then it performs up_write(&s->lock) and it
    calls retry_origin_bios() which dereferences  s->origin.  These two
    memory accesses to the fields of the snapshot may touch the dm_snapshot
    struture after it is freed.
    
    This patch moves the call to free_pending_exception() to the end of
    pending_complete(), so that the snapshot will not be destroyed while
    pending_complete() is in progress.

    dm: fix a race condition in dm_get_md
    
    commit 2bec1f4a8832e74ebbe859f176d8a9cb20dd97f4 upstream.
    
    The function dm_get_md finds a device mapper device with a given dev_t,
    increases the reference count and returns the pointer.
    
    dm_get_md calls dm_find_md, dm_find_md takes _minor_lock, finds the
    device, tests that the device doesn't have DMF_DELETING or DMF_FREEING
    flag, drops _minor_lock and returns pointer to the device. dm_get_md then
    calls dm_get. dm_get calls BUG if the device has the DMF_FREEING flag,
    otherwise it increments the reference count.
    
    There is a possible race condition - after dm_find_md exits and before
    dm_get is called, there are no locks held, so the device may disappear or
    DMF_FREEING flag may be set, which results in BUG.
    
    To fix this bug, we need to call dm_get while we hold _minor_lock. This
    patch renames dm_find_md to dm_get_md and changes it so that it calls
    dm_get while holding the lock.

    ipv6: fix ipv6_cow_metrics for non DST_HOST case
    
    commit 3b4711757d7903ab6fa88a9e7ab8901b8227da60 upstream.
    
    ipv6_cow_metrics() currently assumes only DST_HOST routes require
    dynamic metrics allocation from inetpeer.  The assumption breaks
    when ndisc discovered router with RTAX_MTU and RTAX_HOPLIMIT metric.
    Refer to ndisc_router_discovery() in ndisc.c and note that dst_metric_set()
    is called after the route is created.
    
    This patch creates the metrics array (by calling dst_cow_metrics_generic) in
    ipv6_cow_metrics().
    
    Test:
    radvd.conf:
    interface qemubr0
    {
            AdvLinkMTU 1300;
            AdvCurHopLimit 30;
    
            prefix fd00:face:face:face::/64
            {
                    AdvOnLink on;
                    AdvAutonomous on;
                    AdvRouterAddr off;
            };
    };
    
    Before:
    [root@qemu1 ~]# ip -6 r show | egrep -v unreachable
    fd00:face:face:face::/64 dev eth0  proto kernel  metric 256  expires 27sec
    fe80::/64 dev eth0  proto kernel  metric 256
    default via fe80::74df:d0ff:fe23:8ef2 dev eth0  proto ra  metric 1024  expires 27sec
    
    After:
    [root@qemu1 ~]# ip -6 r show | egrep -v unreachable
    fd00:face:face:face::/64 dev eth0  proto kernel  metric 256  expires 27sec mtu 1300
    fe80::/64 dev eth0  proto kernel  metric 256  mtu 1300
    default via fe80::74df:d0ff:fe23:8ef2 dev eth0  proto ra  metric 1024  expires 27sec mtu 1300 hoplimit 30
    
    Fixes: 8e2ec639173f325 (ipv6: don't use inetpeer to store metrics for routes.)

    dm io: reject unsupported DISCARD requests with EOPNOTSUPP
    
    commit 37527b869207ad4c208b1e13967d69b8bba1fbf9 upstream.
    
    I created a dm-raid1 device backed by a device that supports DISCARD
    and another device that does NOT support DISCARD with the following
    dm configuration:
    
     #  echo '0 2048 mirror core 1 512 2 /dev/sda 0 /dev/sdb 0' | dmsetup create moo
     # lsblk -D
     NAME         DISC-ALN DISC-GRAN DISC-MAX DISC-ZERO
     sda                 0        4K       1G         0
     `-moo (dm-0)        0        4K       1G         0
     sdb                 0        0B       0B         0
     `-moo (dm-0)        0        4K       1G         0
    
    Notice that the mirror device /dev/mapper/moo advertises DISCARD
    support even though one of the mirror halves doesn't.
    
    If I issue a DISCARD request (via fstrim, mount -o discard, or ioctl
    BLKDISCARD) through the mirror, kmirrord gets stuck in an infinite
    loop in do_region() when it tries to issue a DISCARD request to sdb.
    The problem is that when we call do_region() against sdb, num_sectors
    is set to zero because q->limits.max_discard_sectors is zero.
    Therefore, "remaining" never decreases and the loop never terminates.
    
    To fix this: before entering the loop, check for the combination of
    REQ_DISCARD and no discard and return -EOPNOTSUPP to avoid hanging up
    the mirror device.
    
    This bug was found by the unfortunate coincidence of pvmove and a
    discard operation in the RHEL 6.5 kernel; upstream is also affected.

    dm mirror: do not degrade the mirror on discard error
    
    commit f2ed51ac64611d717d1917820a01930174c2f236 upstream.
    
    It may be possible that a device claims discard support but it rejects
    discards with -EOPNOTSUPP.  It happens when using loopback on ext2/ext3
    filesystem driven by the ext4 driver.  It may also happen if the
    underlying devices are moved from one disk on another.
    
    If discard error happens, we reject the bio with -EOPNOTSUPP, but we do
    not degrade the array.
    
    This patch fixes failed test shell/lvconvert-repair-transient.sh in the
    lvm2 testsuite if the testsuite is extracted on an ext2 or ext3
    filesystem and it is being driven by the ext4 driver.

    ALSA: hdspm - Constrain periods to 2 on older cards
    
    commit f0153c3d948c1764f6c920a0675d86fc1d75813e upstream.
    
    RME RayDAT and AIO use a fixed buffer size of 16384 samples. With period
    sizes of 32-4096, this translates to 4-512 periods.
    
    The older RME cards have a variable buffer size but require exactly two
    periods.
    
    This patch enforces nperiods=2 on those cards.

    mm/memory.c: actually remap enough memory
    
    commit 9cb12d7b4ccaa976f97ce0c5fd0f1b6a83bc2a75 upstream.
    
    For whatever reason, generic_access_phys() only remaps one page, but
    actually allows to access arbitrary size.  It's quite easy to trigger
    large reads, like printing out large structure with gdb, which leads to a
    crash.  Fix it by remapping correct size.

    iscsi-target: Drop problematic active_ts_list usage
    
    commit 3fd7b60f2c7418239d586e359e0c6d8503e10646 upstream.
    
    This patch drops legacy active_ts_list usage within iscsi_target_tq.c
    code.  It was originally used to track the active thread sets during
    iscsi-target shutdown, and is no longer used by modern upstream code.
    
    Two people have reported list corruption using traditional iscsi-target
    and iser-target with the following backtrace, that appears to be related
    to iscsi_thread_set->ts_list being used across both active_ts_list and
    inactive_ts_list.

    mm/nommu.c: fix arithmetic overflow in __vm_enough_memory()
    
    commit 8138a67a5557ffea3a21dfd6f037842d4e748513 upstream.
    
    I noticed that "allowed" can easily overflow by falling below 0, because
    (total_vm / 32) can be larger than "allowed".  The problem occurs in
    OVERCOMMIT_NONE mode.
    
    In this case, a huge allocation can success and overcommit the system
    (despite OVERCOMMIT_NONE mode).  All subsequent allocations will fall
    (system-wide), so system become unusable.
    
    The problem was masked out by commit c9b1d0981fcc
    ("mm: limit growth of 3% hardcoded other user reserve"),
    but it's easy to reproduce it on older kernels:
    1) set overcommit_memory sysctl to 2
    2) mmap() large file multiple times (with VM_SHARED flag)
    3) try to malloc() large amount of memory
    
    It also can be reproduced on newer kernels, but miss-configured
    sysctl_user_reserve_kbytes is required.
    
    Fix this issue by switching to signed arithmetic here.

    The problem was masked out by commit c9b1d0981fcc
    ("mm: limit growth of 3% hardcoded other user reserve"),
    but it's easy to reproduce it on older kernels:
    1) set overcommit_memory sysctl to 2
    2) mmap() large file multiple times (with VM_SHARED flag)
    3) try to malloc() large amount of memory
    
    It also can be reproduced on newer kernels, but miss-configured
    sysctl_user_reserve_kbytes is required.
    
    Fix this issue by switching to signed arithmetic here.

    mm/hugetlb: add migration entry check in __unmap_hugepage_range
    
    commit 9fbc1f635fd0bd28cb32550211bf095753ac637a upstream.
    
    If __unmap_hugepage_range() tries to unmap the address range over which
    hugepage migration is on the way, we get the wrong page because pte_page()
    doesn't work for migration entries.  This patch simply clears the pte for
    migration entries as we do for hwpoison entries.

    mm/hugetlb: add migration/hwpoisoned entry check in hugetlb_change_protection
    
    commit a8bda28d87c38c6aa93de28ba5d30cc18e865a11 upstream.
    
    There is a race condition between hugepage migration and
    change_protection(), where hugetlb_change_protection() doesn't care about
    migration entries and wrongly overwrites them.  That causes unexpected
    results like kernel crash.  HWPoison entries also can cause the same
    problem.
    
    This patch adds is_hugetlb_entry_(migration|hwpoisoned) check in this
    function to do proper actions.

    mm/hugetlb: fix getting refcount 0 page in hugetlb_fault()
    
    commit 0f792cf949a0be506c2aa8bfac0605746b146dda upstream.
    
    When running the test which causes the race as shown in the previous patch,
    we can hit the BUG "get_page() on refcount 0 page" in hugetlb_fault().
    
    This race happens when pte turns into migration entry just after the first
    check of is_hugetlb_entry_migration() in hugetlb_fault() passed with false.
    To fix this, we need to check pte_present() again after huge_ptep_get().
    
    This patch also reorders taking ptl and doing pte_page(), because
    pte_page() should be done in ptl.  Due to this reordering, we need use
    trylock_page() in page != pagecache_page case to respect locking order.

    cpufreq: speedstep-smi: enable interrupts when waiting
    
    commit d4d4eda23794c701442e55129dd4f8f2fefd5e4d upstream.
    
    On Dell Latitude C600 laptop with Pentium 3 850MHz processor, the
    speedstep-smi driver sometimes loads and sometimes doesn't load with
    "change to state X failed" message.
    
    The hardware sometimes refuses to change frequency and in this case, we
    need to retry later. I found out that we need to enable interrupts while
    waiting. When we enable interrupts, the hardware blockage that prevents
    frequency transition resolves and the transition is possible. With
    disabled interrupts, the blockage doesn't resolve (no matter how long do
    we wait). The exact reasons for this hardware behavior are unknown.
    
    This patch enables interrupts in the function speedstep_set_state that can
    be called with disabled interrupts. However, this function is called with
    disabled interrupts only from speedstep_get_freqs, so it shouldn't cause
    any problem.

    fsnotify: fix handling of renames in audit
    
    commit 6ee8e25fc3e916193bce4ebb43d5439e1e2144ab upstream.
    
    Commit e9fd702a58c4 ("audit: convert audit watches to use fsnotify
    instead of inotify") broke handling of renames in audit.  Audit code
    wants to update inode number of an inode corresponding to watched name
    in a directory.  When something gets renamed into a directory to a
    watched name, inotify previously passed moved inode to audit code
    however new fsnotify code passes directory inode where the change
    happened.  That confuses audit and it starts watching parent directory
    instead of a file in a directory.
    
    This can be observed for example by doing:
    
      cd /tmp
      touch foo bar
      auditctl -w /tmp/foo
      touch foo
      mv bar foo
      touch foo
    
    In audit log we see events like:
    
      type=CONFIG_CHANGE msg=audit(1423563584.155:90): auid=1000 ses=2 op="updated rules" path="/tmp/foo" key=(null) list=4 res=1
      ...
      type=PATH msg=audit(1423563584.155:91): item=2 name="bar" inode=1046884 dev=08:0 2 mode=0100644 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 nametype=DELETE
      type=PATH msg=audit(1423563584.155:91): item=3 name="foo" inode=1046842 dev=08:0 2 mode=0100644 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 nametype=DELETE
      type=PATH msg=audit(1423563584.155:91): item=4 name="foo" inode=1046884 dev=08:0 2 mode=0100644 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 nametype=CREATE
      ...
    
    and that's it - we see event for the first touch after creating the
    audit rule, we see events for rename but we don't see any event for the
    last touch.  However we start seeing events for unrelated stuff
    happening in /tmp.
    
    Fix the problem by passing moved inode as data in the FS_MOVED_FROM and
    FS_MOVED_TO events instead of the directory where the change happens.
    This doesn't introduce any new problems because noone besides
    audit_watch.c cares about the passed value:
    
      fs/notify/fanotify/fanotify.c cares only about FSNOTIFY_EVENT_PATH events.
      fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c doesn't care about passed 'data' value at all.
      fs/notify/inotify/inotify_fsnotify.c uses 'data' only for FSNOTIFY_EVENT_PATH.
      kernel/audit_tree.c doesn't care about passed 'data' at all.
      kernel/audit_watch.c expects moved inode as 'data'.

    ALSA: off by one bug in snd_riptide_joystick_probe()
    
    commit e4940626defdf6c92da1052ad3f12741c1a28c90 upstream.
    
    The problem here is that we check:
    
            if (dev >= SNDRV_CARDS)
    
    Then we increment "dev".
    
           if (!joystick_port[dev++])
    
    Then we use it as an offset into a array with SNDRV_CARDS elements.
    
            if (!request_region(joystick_port[dev], 8, "Riptide gameport")) {
    
    This has 3 effects:
    1) If you use the module option to specify the joystick port then it has
       to be shifted one space over.
    2) The wrong error message will be printed on failure if you have over
       32 cards.
    3) Static checkers will correctly complain that are off by one.

    rtnetlink: ifla_vf_policy: fix misuses of NLA_BINARY
    
    commit 364d5716a7adb91b731a35765d369602d68d2881 upstream.
    
    ifla_vf_policy[] is wrong in advertising its individual member types as
    NLA_BINARY since .type = NLA_BINARY in combination with .len declares the
    len member as *max* attribute length [0, len].
    
    The issue is that when do_setvfinfo() is being called to set up a VF
    through ndo handler, we could set corrupted data if the attribute length
    is less than the size of the related structure itself.
    
    The intent is exactly the opposite, namely to make sure to pass at least
    data of minimum size of len.

    xen/manage: Fix USB interaction issues when resuming
    
    commit 72978b2fe2f2cdf9f319c6c6dcdbe92b38de2be2 upstream.

    before suspending to reduce interaction issues when resuming devices.
    However, freeze_processes() does not freeze kernel threads.  Freeze
    kernel threads as well to prevent deadlocks with the khubd thread when
    resuming devices.

    tty: Prevent untrappable signals from malicious program
    
    commit 37480a05685ed5b8e1b9bf5e5c53b5810258b149 upstream.
    
    Commit 26df6d13406d1a5 ("tty: Add EXTPROC support for LINEMODE")
    allows a process which has opened a pty master to send _any_ signal
    to the process group of the pty slave. Although potentially
    exploitable by a malicious program running a setuid program on
    a pty slave, it's unknown if this exploit currently exists.

    USB: fix use-after-free bug in usb_hcd_unlink_urb()
    
    commit c99197902da284b4b723451c1471c45b18537cde upstream.
    
    The usb_hcd_unlink_urb() routine in hcd.c contains two possible
    use-after-free errors.  The dev_dbg() statement at the end of the
    routine dereferences urb and urb->dev even though both structures may
    have been deallocated.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by storing urb->dev in a local variable
    (avoiding the dereference of urb) and moving the dev_dbg() up before
    the usb_put_dev() call.

    USB: add flag for HCDs that can't receive wakeup requests (isp1760-hcd)
    
    commit 074f9dd55f9cab1b82690ed7e44bcf38b9616ce0 upstream.
    
    Currently the USB stack assumes that all host controller drivers are
    capable of receiving wakeup requests from downstream devices.
    However, this isn't true for the isp1760-hcd driver, which means that
    it isn't safe to do a runtime suspend of any device attached to a
    root-hub port if the device requires wakeup.
    
    This patch adds a "cant_recv_wakeups" flag to the usb_hcd structure
    and sets the flag in isp1760-hcd.  The core is modified to prevent a
    direct child of the root hub from being put into runtime suspend with
    wakeup enabled if the flag is set.

    nfs41_callback_svc does most of its work while in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE,
    which is just wrong. Fix that by finishing the wait immediately if we've
    found that the list has something on it.
    
    Also, we don't expect this kthread to accept signals, so we should be
    using a TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE sleep instead. That however, opens us up
    hung task warnings from the watchdog, so have the schedule_timeout
    wake up every 60s if there's no callback activity.

    commit e461894dc2ce7778ccde1c3483c9b15a85a7fc5f upstream.
    
    StrongARM core uses RCSR SMR bit to tell to bootloader that it was reset
    by entering the sleep mode. After we have resumed, there is little point
    in having that bit enabled. Moreover, if this bit is set before reboot,
    the bootloader can become confused. Thus clear the SMR bit on resume
    just before clearing the scratchpad (resume address) register.

    staging: comedi: comedi_compat32.c: fix COMEDI_CMD copy back
    
    commit 42b8ce6f55facfa101462e694d33fc6bca471138 upstream.
    
    `do_cmd_ioctl()` in "comedi_fops.c" handles the `COMEDI_CMD` ioctl.
    This returns `-EAGAIN` if it has copied a modified `struct comedi_cmd`
    back to user-space.  (This occurs when the low-level Comedi driver's
    `do_cmdtest()` handler returns non-zero to indicate a problem with the
    contents of the `struct comedi_cmd`, or when the `struct comedi_cmd` has
    the `CMDF_BOGUS` flag set.)
    
    `compat_cmd()` in "comedi_compat32.c" handles the 32-bit compatible
    version of the `COMEDI_CMD` ioctl.  Currently, it never copies a 32-bit
    compatible version of `struct comedi_cmd` back to user-space, which is
    at odds with the way the regular `COMEDI_CMD` ioctl is handled.  To fix
    it, change `compat_cmd()` to copy a 32-bit compatible version of the
    `struct comedi_cmd` back to user-space when the main ioctl handler
    returns `-EAGAIN`.

    commit 16b036af31e1456cb69243a5a0c9ef801ecd1f17 upstream.
    
    If the image size would ever read as 0, pci_get_rom_size() could keep

    smack: fix possible use after frees in task_security() callers
    
    commit 6d1cff2a885850b78b40c34777b46cf5da5d1050 upstream.
    
    We hit use after free on dereferncing pointer to task_smack struct in
    smk_of_task() called from smack_task_to_inode().
    
    task_security() macro uses task_cred_xxx() to get pointer to the task_smack.
    task_cred_xxx() could be used only for non-pointer members of task's
    credentials. It cannot be used for pointer members since what they point
    to may disapper after dropping RCU read lock.
    
    Mainly task_security() used this way:
            smk_of_task(task_security(p))
    
    Intead of this introduce function smk_of_task_struct() which
    takes task_struct as argument and returns pointer to smk_known struct
    and do this under RCU read lock.
    Bogus task_security() macro is not used anymore, so remove it.
    
    KASan's report for this:

    TPM: Add new TPMs to the tail of the list to prevent inadvertent change of dev
    
    commit 398a1e71dc827b994b7f2f56c7c2186fea7f8d75 upstream.
    
    Add newly registered TPMs to the tail of the list, not the beginning, so that
    things that are specifying TPM_ANY_NUM don't find that the device they're
    using has inadvertently changed.  Adding a second device would break IMA, for
    instance.

    usb: core: buffer: smallest buffer should start at ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN
    
    commit 5efd2ea8c9f4f12916ffc8ba636792ce052f6911 upstream.
    
    the following error pops up during "testusb -a -t 10"
    | musb-hdrc musb-hdrc.1.auto: dma_pool_free buffer-128, f134e000/be842000 (bad dma)
    hcd_buffer_create() creates a few buffers, the smallest has 32 bytes of
    size. ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is set to 64 bytes. This combo results in
    hcd_buffer_alloc() returning memory which is 32 bytes aligned and it
    might by identified by buffer_offset() as another buffer. This means the
    buffer which is on a 32 byte boundary will not get freed, instead it
    tries to free another buffer with the error message.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by creating the smallest DMA buffer with the
    size of ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN (or 32 in case ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is
    smaller). This might be 32, 64 or even 128 bytes. The next three pools
    will have the size 128, 512 and 2048.
    In case the smallest pool is 128 bytes then we have only three pools
    instead of four (and zero the first entry in the array).
    The last pool size is always 2048 bytes which is the assumed PAGE_SIZE /
    2 of 4096. I doubt it makes sense to continue using PAGE_SIZE / 2 where
    we would end up with 8KiB buffer in case we have 16KiB pages.
    Instead I think it makes sense to have a common size(s) and extend them
    if there is need to.
    There is a BUILD_BUG_ON() now in case someone has a minalign of more than
    128 bytes.

    kernel.h: add BUILD_BUG() macro
    
    commit 1399ff86f2a2bbacbbe68fa00c5f8c752b344723 upstream.
    
    We can place this in definitions that we expect the compiler to remove by
    dead code elimination.  If this assertion fails, we get a nice error
    message at build time.
    
    The GCC function attribute error("message") was added in version 4.3, so
    we define a new macro __linktime_error(message) to expand to this for
    GCC-4.3 and later.  This will give us an error diagnostic from the
    compiler on the line that fails.  For other compilers
    __linktime_error(message) expands to nothing, and we have to be content
    with a link time error, but at least we will still get a build error.
    
    BUILD_BUG() expands to the undefined function __build_bug_failed() and
    will fail at link time if the compiler ever emits code for it.  On GCC-4.3
    and later, attribute((error())) is used so that the failure will be noted
    at compile time instead.

    PCI: Generate uppercase hex for modalias var in uevent
    
    commit 145b3fe579db66fbe999a2bc3fd5b63dffe9636d upstream.
    
    Some implementations of modprobe fail to load the driver for a PCI device
    automatically because the "interface" part of the modalias from the kernel
    is lowercase, and the modalias from file2alias is uppercase.
    
    The "interface" is the low-order byte of the Class Code, defined in PCI
    r3.0, Appendix D.  Most interface types defined in the spec do not use
    alpha characters, so they won't be affected.  For example, 00h, 01h, 10h,
    20h, etc. are unaffected.
    
    Print the "interface" byte of the Class Code in uppercase hex, as we
    already do for the Vendor ID, Device ID, Class, etc.
    
    Commit 89ec3dcf17fd ("PCI: Generate uppercase hex for modalias interface
    class") fixed only half of the problem.  Some udev implementations rely on
    the uevent file and not the modalias file.

    commit 23b133bdc452aa441fcb9b82cbf6dd05cfd342d0 upstream.
    
    Check length of extended attributes and allocation descriptors when
    loading inodes from disk. Otherwise corrupted filesystems could confuse
    the code and make the kernel oops.

    hx4700: regulator: declare full constraints
    
    commit a52d209336f8fc7483a8c7f4a8a7d2a8e1692a6c upstream.
    
    Since the removal of CONFIG_REGULATOR_DUMMY option, the touchscreen stopped
    working. This patch enables the "replacement" for REGULATOR_DUMMY and
    allows the touchscreen to work even though there is no regulator for "vcc".

    ARM: pxa: add regulator_has_full_constraints to spitz board file
    
    commit baad2dc49c5d970ea881d92981a1b76c94a7b7a1 upstream.
    
    Add regulator_has_full_constraints() call to spitz board file to let
    regulator core know that we do not have any additional regulators left.
    This lets it substitute unprovided regulators with dummy ones.
    
    This fixes the following warnings that can be seen on spitz if
    regulators are enabled:
