    gcov: add support for GCC 10.1
    
    [ Upstream commit 40249c6962075c040fd071339acae524f18bfac9 ]
    
    Using gcov to collect coverage data for kernels compiled with GCC 10.1
    causes random malfunctions and kernel crashes.  This is the result of a
    changed GCOV_COUNTERS value in GCC 10.1 that causes a mismatch between
    the layout of the gcov_info structure created by GCC profiling code and
    the related structure used by the kernel.
    
    Fix this by updating the in-kernel GCOV_COUNTERS value.  Also re-enable
    config GCOV_KERNEL for use with GCC 10.

    usb: Fix out of sync data toggle if a configured device is reconfigured
    
    commit cfd54fa83a5068b61b7eb28d3c117d8354c74c7a upstream.
    
    Userspace drivers that use a SetConfiguration() request to "lightweight"
    reset an already configured usb device might cause data toggles to get out
    of sync between the device and host, and the device becomes unusable.
    
    The xHCI host requires endpoints to be dropped and added back to reset the
    toggle. If USB core notices the new configuration is the same as the
    current active configuration it will avoid these extra steps by calling
    usb_reset_configuration() instead of usb_set_configuration().
    
    A SetConfiguration() request will reset the device side data toggles.
    Make sure usb_reset_configuration() function also drops and adds back the
    endpoints to ensure data toggles are in sync.
    
    To avoid code duplication split the current usb_disable_device() function
    and reuse the endpoint specific part.

    USB: serial: option: add support for SIM7070/SIM7080/SIM7090 modules
    
    commit 1ac698790819b83f39fd7ea4f6cdabee9bdd7b38 upstream.
    
    These modules have 2 different USB layouts:
    
    The default layout with PID 0x9205 (AT+CUSBSELNV=1) exposes 4 TTYs and
    an ECM interface:

     * ttyUSB1: GNSS data.
     * ttyUSB2: AT-capable port (control).
     * ttyUSB3: AT-capable port (data).
    
    In the secondary layout with PID=0x9206 (AT+CUSBSELNV=86) the module
    exposes 6 TTY ports:
    
      T:  Bus=02 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=02 Cnt=01 Dev#=  8 Spd=480 MxCh= 0

    USB: serial: option: support dynamic Quectel USB compositions
    
    commit 2bb70f0a4b238323e4e2f392fc3ddeb5b7208c9e upstream.
    
    The USB composition, defining the set of exported functions, is dynamic
    in newer Quectel modems.  Default functions can be disabled and
    alternative functions can be enabled instead.  The alternatives
    includes class functions using interface pairs, which should be
    handled by the respective class drivers.
    
    Active interfaces are numbered consecutively, so static
    blacklisting based on interface numbers will fail when the
    composition changes.  An example of such an error, where the
    option driver has bound to the CDC ECM data interface,
    preventing cdc_ether from handling this function:

    Change rules for EC21, EC25, BG96 and EG95 to match vendor specific

    There were some problem in ipq8074 Gen2 PCIe phy init sequence.
    
    1. Few register values were wrongly updated in the phy init sequence.
    2. The register QSERDES_RX_SIGDET_CNTRL is a RX tuning parameter
       register which is added in serdes table causing the wrong register
       was getting updated.
    3. Clocks and resets were not added in the phy init.
    
    Fix these to make Gen2 PCIe port on ipq8074 devices to work.

    KVM: arm64: Do not try to map PUDs when they are folded into PMD
    
    commit 3fb884ffe921c99483a84b0175f3c03f048e9069 upstream.
    
    For the obscure cases where PMD and PUD are the same size
    (64kB pages with 42bit VA, for example, which results in only
    two levels of page tables), we can't map anything as a PUD,
    because there is... erm... no PUD to speak of. Everything is
    either a PMD or a PTE.
    
    So let's only try and map a PUD when its size is different from
    that of a PMD.

    vgacon: remove software scrollback support
    
    commit 973c096f6a85e5b5f2a295126ba6928d9a6afd45 upstream.
    
    Yunhai Zhang recently fixed a VGA software scrollback bug in commit
    ebfdfeeae8c0 ("vgacon: Fix for missing check in scrollback handling"),
    but that then made people look more closely at some of this code, and
    there were more problems on the vgacon side, but also the fbcon software
    scrollback.
    
    We don't really have anybody who maintains this code - probably because
    nobody actually _uses_ it any more.  Sure, people still use both VGA and
    the framebuffer consoles, but they are no longer the main user
    interfaces to the kernel, and haven't been for decades, so these kinds
    of extra features end up bitrotting and not really being used.
    
    So rather than try to maintain a likely unused set of code, I'll just
    aggressively remove it, and see if anybody even notices.  Maybe there
    are people who haven't jumped on the whole GUI badnwagon yet, and think
    it's just a fad.  And maybe those people use the scrollback code.
    
    If that turns out to be the case, we can resurrect this again, once
    we've found the sucker^Wmaintainer for it who actually uses it.

    This (and the VGA soft scrollback) turns out to have various nasty small
    special cases that nobody really is willing to fight.  The soft
    scrollback code was really useful a few decades ago when you typically
    used the console interactively as the main way to interact with the
    machine, but that just isn't the case any more.
    
    So it's not worth dragging along.

    rbd: require global CAP_SYS_ADMIN for mapping and unmapping
    
    commit f44d04e696feaf13d192d942c4f14ad2e117065a upstream.
    
    It turns out that currently we rely only on sysfs attribute
    permissions:
    
      $ ll /sys/bus/rbd/{add*,remove*}
      --w------- 1 root root 4096 Sep  3 20:37 /sys/bus/rbd/add
      --w------- 1 root root 4096 Sep  3 20:37 /sys/bus/rbd/add_single_major
      --w------- 1 root root 4096 Sep  3 20:37 /sys/bus/rbd/remove
      --w------- 1 root root 4096 Sep  3 20:38 /sys/bus/rbd/remove_single_major
    
    This means that images can be mapped and unmapped (i.e. block devices
    can be created and deleted) by a UID 0 process even after it drops all
    privileges or by any process with CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE in its user namespace
    as long as UID 0 is mapped into that user namespace.
    
    Be consistent with other virtual block devices (loop, nbd, dm, md, etc)
    and require CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the initial user namespace for mapping and
    unmapping, and also for dumping the configuration string and refreshing
    the image header.

    mmc: sdio: Use mmc_pre_req() / mmc_post_req()
    
    commit f0c393e2104e48c8a881719a8bd37996f71b0aee upstream.
    
    SDHCI changed from using a tasklet to finish requests, to using an IRQ
    thread i.e. commit c07a48c2651965 ("mmc: sdhci: Remove finish_tasklet").
    Because this increased the latency to complete requests, a preparatory
    change was made to complete the request from the IRQ handler if
    possible i.e. commit 19d2f695f4e827 ("mmc: sdhci: Call mmc_request_done()
    from IRQ handler if possible").  That alleviated the situation for MMC
    block devices because the MMC block driver makes use of mmc_pre_req()
    and mmc_post_req() so that successful requests are completed in the IRQ
    handler and any DMA unmapping is handled separately in mmc_post_req().
    However SDIO was still affected, and an example has been reported with
    up to 20% degradation in performance.
    
    Looking at SDIO I/O helper functions, sdio_io_rw_ext_helper() appeared
    to be a possible candidate for making use of asynchronous requests
    within its I/O loops, but analysis revealed that these loops almost
    never iterate more than once, so the complexity of the change would not
    be warrented.
    
    Instead, mmc_pre_req() and mmc_post_req() are added before and after I/O
    submission (mmc_wait_for_req) in mmc_io_rw_extended().  This still has
    the potential benefit of reducing the duration of interrupt handlers, as
    well as addressing the latency issue for SDHCI.  It also seems a more
    reasonable solution than forcing drivers to do everything in the IRQ
    handler.

    drm/tve200: Stabilize enable/disable
    
    commit f71800228dc74711c3df43854ce7089562a3bc2d upstream.
    
    The TVE200 will occasionally print a bunch of lost interrupts
    and similar dmesg messages, sometimes during boot and sometimes
    after disabling and coming back to enablement. This is probably
    because the hardware is left in an unknown state by the boot
    loader that displays a logo.
    
    This can be fixed by bringing the controller into a known state
    by resetting the controller while enabling it. We retry reset 5
    times like the vendor driver does. We also put the controller
    into reset before de-clocking it and clear all interrupts before
    enabling the vblank IRQ.
    
    This makes the video enable/disable/enable cycle rock solid
    on the D-Link DIR-685. Tested extensively.

    scsi: target: iscsi: Fix hang in iscsit_access_np() when getting tpg->np_login_sem
    
    commit ed43ffea78dcc97db3f561da834f1a49c8961e33 upstream.
    
    The iSCSI target login thread might get stuck with the following stack:
    
    cat /proc/`pidof iscsi_np`/stack
    [<0>] down_interruptible+0x42/0x50
    [<0>] iscsit_access_np+0xe3/0x167
    [<0>] iscsi_target_locate_portal+0x695/0x8ac
    [<0>] __iscsi_target_login_thread+0x855/0xb82
    [<0>] iscsi_target_login_thread+0x2f/0x5a
    [<0>] kthread+0xfa/0x130
    [<0>] ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30
    
    This can be reproduced via the following steps:
    
    1. Initiator A tries to log in to iqn1-tpg1 on port 3260. After finishing
       PDU exchange in the login thread and before the negotiation is finished
       the the network link goes down. At this point A has not finished login
       and tpg->np_login_sem is held.
    
    2. Initiator B tries to log in to iqn2-tpg1 on port 3260. After finishing
       PDU exchange in the login thread the target expects to process remaining
       login PDUs in workqueue context.
    
    3. Initiator A' tries to log in to iqn1-tpg1 on port 3260 from a new
       socket. A' will wait for tpg->np_login_sem with np->np_login_timer
       loaded to wait for at most 15 seconds. The lock is held by A so A'
       eventually times out.
    
    4. Before A' got timeout initiator B gets negotiation failed and calls
       iscsi_target_login_drop()->iscsi_target_login_sess_out().  The
       np->np_login_timer is canceled and initiator A' will hang forever.
       Because A' is now in the login thread, no new login requests can be
       serviced.
    
    Fix this by moving iscsi_stop_login_thread_timer() out of
    iscsi_target_login_sess_out(). Also remove iscsi_np parameter from
    iscsi_target_login_sess_out().

    commit 5528d03183fe5243416c706f64b1faa518b05130 upstream.

    regulator: core: Fix slab-out-of-bounds in regulator_unlock_recursive()
    
    commit 0a7416f94707c60b9f66b01c0a505b7e41375f3a upstream.
    
    The recent commit 7d8196641ee1 ("regulator: Remove pointer table
    overallocation") changed the size of coupled_rdevs and now KASAN is able
    to detect slab-out-of-bounds problem in regulator_unlock_recursive(),
    which is a legit problem caused by a typo in the code. The recursive
    unlock function uses n_coupled value of a parent regulator for unlocking
    supply regulator, while supply's n_coupled should be used. In practice
    problem may only affect platforms that use coupled regulators.

    commit d3c731564e09b6c2ebefcd1344743a91a237d6dc upstream.
    
    By calling device_initialize() earlier and noting that kfree(NULL) is
    ok, we can save a bit of code in error handling and plug of_node leak.

    commit 73a32129f8ccb556704a26b422f54e048bf14bd0 upstream.
    
    Allocating memory with regulator_list_mutex held makes lockdep unhappy
    when memory pressure makes the system do fs_reclaim on eg. eMMC using
    a regulator. Push the lock inside regulator_init_coupling() after the
    allocation.

    btrfs: fix wrong address when faulting in pages in the search ioctl
    
    commit 1c78544eaa4660096aeb6a57ec82b42cdb3bfe5a upstream.
    
    When faulting in the pages for the user supplied buffer for the search
    ioctl, we are passing only the base address of the buffer to the function
    fault_in_pages_writeable(). This means that after the first iteration of
    the while loop that searches for leaves, when we have a non-zero offset,
    stored in 'sk_offset', we try to fault in a wrong page range.
    
    So fix this by adding the offset in 'sk_offset' to the base address of the
    user supplied buffer when calling fault_in_pages_writeable().
    
    Several users have reported that the applications compsize and bees have
    started to operate incorrectly since commit a48b73eca4ceb9 ("btrfs: fix
    potential deadlock in the search ioctl") was added to stable trees, and
    these applications make heavy use of the search ioctls. This fixes their
    issues.

    This is because we are holding the chunk_mutex when we call
    btrfs_alloc_device, which does a GFP_KERNEL allocation.  We don't want
    to switch that to a GFP_NOFS lock because this is the only place where
    it matters.  So instead use memalloc_nofs_save() around the allocation
    in order to avoid the lockdep splat.

    [BUG]
    A completely sane converted fs will cause kernel warning at balance

    Then with transaction abort, and obviously failed to balance the fs.
    
    [CAUSE]
    That mentioned inline ref type 182 is completely sane, it's
    BTRFS_SHARED_BLOCK_REF_KEY, it's some extra check making kernel to
    believe it's invalid.
    
    Commit 64ecdb647ddb ("Btrfs: add one more sanity check for shared ref
    type") introduced extra checks for backref type.
    
    One of the requirement is, parent bytenr must be aligned to node size,
    which is not correct.
    
    One example is like this:
    
    0       1G  1G+4K               2G 2G+4K
            |   |///////////////////|//|  <- A chunk starts at 1G+4K
                |   |       <- A tree block get reserved at bytenr 1G+4K
    
    Then we have a valid tree block at bytenr 1G+4K, but not aligned to
    nodesize (16K).
    
    Such chunk is not ideal, but current kernel can handle it pretty well.
    We may warn about such tree block in the future, but should not reject
    them.
    
    [FIX]
    Change the alignment requirement from node size alignment to sector size
    alignment.
    
    Also, to make our lives a little easier, also output @iref when
    btrfs_get_extent_inline_ref_type() failed, so we can locate the item
    easier.

    staging: wlan-ng: fix out of bounds read in prism2sta_probe_usb()
    
    commit fea22e159d51c766ba70473f473a0ec914cc7e92 upstream.
    
    let's use usb_find_common_endpoints() to discover endpoints, it does all
    necessary checks for type and xfer direction
    
    remove memset() in hfa384x_create(), because we now assign endpoints in
    prism2sta_probe_usb() and because create_wlan() uses kzalloc() to
    allocate hfa384x struct before calling hfa384x_create()

    iio:accel:mma8452: Fix timestamp alignment and prevent data leak.
    
    commit 89226a296d816727405d3fea684ef69e7d388bd8 upstream.
    
    One of a class of bugs pointed out by Lars in a recent review.
    iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp assumes the buffer used is aligned
    to the size of the timestamp (8 bytes).  This is not guaranteed in
    this driver which uses a 16 byte u8 array on the stack.  As Lars also noted
    this anti pattern can involve a leak of data to userspace and that
    indeed can happen here.  We close both issues by moving to
    a suitable structure in the iio_priv() data with alignment
    ensured by use of an explicit c structure.  This data is allocated
    with kzalloc so no data can leak appart from previous readings.
    
    The additional forcing of the 8 byte alignment of the timestamp
    is not strictly necessary but makes the code less fragile by
    making this explicit.

    is not guaranteed by an array of smaller elements.
    
    Note that whilst in this particular case the alignment forcing
    of the ts element is not strictly necessary it acts as good
    documentation.  Doing this where not necessary should cut
    down on the number of cut and paste introduced errors elsewhere.

    iio:adc:max1118 Fix alignment of timestamp and data leak issues
    
    commit db8f06d97ec284dc018e2e4890d2e5035fde8630 upstream.
    
    One of a class of bugs pointed out by Lars in a recent review.
    iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp assumes the buffer used is aligned
    to the size of the timestamp (8 bytes).  This is not guaranteed in
    this driver which uses an array of smaller elements on the stack.
    As Lars also noted this anti pattern can involve a leak of data to
    userspace and that indeed can happen here.  We close both issues by
    moving to a suitable structure in the iio_priv() data.
    
    This data is allocated with kzalloc so no data can leak apart
    from previous readings.
    
    The explicit alignment of ts is necessary to ensure correct padding
    on architectures where s64 is only 4 bytes aligned such as x86_32.

    isn't technically needed here, but it reduced fragility and avoids
    cut and paste into drivers where it will be needed.
    
    If we want this in older stables will need manual backport due to

    [ Upstream commit d98299885c9ea140c1108545186593deba36c4ac ]
    
    On my R9 390, the voltage was reported as a constant 1000 mV.
    This was due to a bug in smu7_hwmgr.c, in the smu7_read_sensor()
    function, where some magic constants were used in a condition,
    to determine whether the voltage should be read from PLANE2_VID
    or PLANE1_VID. The VDDC mask was incorrectly used, instead of
    the VDDGFX mask.
    
    This patch changes the code to use the correct defined constants
    (and apply the correct bitshift), thus resulting in correct voltage reporting.

    ALSA: hda: fix a runtime pm issue in SOF when integrated GPU is disabled
    
    [ Upstream commit 13774d81f38538c5fa2924bdcdfa509155480fa6 ]
    
    In snd_hdac_device_init pm_runtime_set_active is called to
    increase child_count in parent device. But when it is failed
    to build connection with GPU for one case that integrated
    graphic gpu is disabled, snd_hdac_ext_bus_device_exit will be
    invoked to clean up a HD-audio extended codec base device. At
    this time the child_count of parent is not decreased, which
    makes parent device can't get suspended.
    
    This patch calls pm_runtime_set_suspended to decrease child_count
    in parent device in snd_hdac_device_exit to match with
    snd_hdac_device_init. pm_runtime_set_suspended can make sure that
    it will not decrease child_count if the device is already suspended.

    arm64/module: set trampoline section flags regardless of CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE
    
    [ Upstream commit e0328feda79d9681b3e3245e6e180295550c8ee9 ]
    
    In the arm64 module linker script, the section .text.ftrace_trampoline
    is specified unconditionally regardless of whether CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE
    is enabled (this is simply due to the limitation that module linker
    scripts are not preprocessed like the vmlinux one).
    
    Normally, for .plt and .text.ftrace_trampoline, the section flags
    present in the module binary wouldn't matter since module_frob_arch_sections()
    would assign them manually anyway. However, the arm64 module loader only
    sets the section flags for .text.ftrace_trampoline when CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE=y.
    That's only become problematic recently due to a recent change in
    binutils-2.35, where the .text.ftrace_trampoline section (along with the
    .plt section) is now marked writable and executable (WAX).
    
    We no longer allow writable and executable sections to be loaded due to
    commit 5c3a7db0c7ec ("module: Harden STRICT_MODULE_RWX"), so this is
    causing all modules linked with binutils-2.35 to be rejected under arm64.
    Drop the IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE) check in module_frob_arch_sections()
    so that the section flags for .text.ftrace_trampoline get properly set to
    SHF_EXECINSTR|SHF_ALLOC, without SHF_WRITE.

    cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix intel_pstate_get_hwp_max() for turbo disabled
    
    [ Upstream commit eacc9c5a927e474c173a5d53dd7fb8e306511768 ]
    
    This fixes the behavior of the scaling_max_freq and scaling_min_freq
    sysfs files in systems which had turbo disabled by the BIOS.
    
    Caleb noticed that the HWP is programmed to operate in the wrong
    P-state range on his system when the CPUFREQ policy min/max frequency
    is set via sysfs.  This seems to be because in his system
    intel_pstate_get_hwp_max() is returning the maximum turbo P-state even
    though turbo was disabled by the BIOS, which causes intel_pstate to
    scale kHz frequencies incorrectly e.g. setting the maximum turbo
    frequency whenever the maximum guaranteed frequency is requested via
    sysfs.

    mode with HWP enabled") it is possible to change the driver status
    to "off" via sysfs with HWP enabled, which effectively causes the
    driver to unregister itself, but HWP remains active and it forces the
    minimum performance, so even if another cpufreq driver is loaded,
    it will not be able to control the CPU frequency.
    
    For this reason, make the driver refuse to change the status to
    "off" with HWP enabled.

    ARC: [plat-hsdk]: Switch ethernet phy-mode to rgmii-id
    
    [ Upstream commit 26907eb605fbc3ba9dbf888f21d9d8d04471271d ]
    
    HSDK board has Micrel KSZ9031, recent commit
    bcf3440c6dd ("net: phy: micrel: add phy-mode support for the KSZ9031 PHY")
    caused a breakdown of Ethernet.
    Using 'phy-mode = "rgmii"' is not correct because accodring RGMII
    specification it is necessary to have delay on RX (PHY to MAX)
    which is not generated in case of "rgmii".
    Using "rgmii-id" adds necessary delay and solves the issue.
    
    Also adding name of PHY placed on HSDK board.

    When operating in XInput mode, the 8bitdo SN30 Pro+ requires the same
    quirk as the official Xbox One Bluetooth controllers for rumble to
    function.
    
    Other controllers like the N30 Pro 2, SF30 Pro, SN30 Pro, etc. probably
    also need this quirk, but I do not have the hardware to test.

    HID: quirks: Set INCREMENT_USAGE_ON_DUPLICATE for all Saitek X52 devices
    
    [ Upstream commit 77df710ba633dfb6c65c65cf99ea9e084a1c9933 ]
    
    The Saitek X52 family of joysticks has a pair of axes that were
    originally (by the Windows driver) used as mouse pointer controls. The
    corresponding usage page is the Game Controls page, which is not
    recognized by the generic HID driver, and therefore, both axes get
    mapped to ABS_MISC. The quirk makes the second axis get mapped to
    ABS_MISC+1, and therefore made available separately.
    
    One Saitek X52 device is already fixed. This patch fixes the other two
    known devices with VID/PID 06a3:0255 and 06a3:0762.

    nvme-pci: cancel nvme device request before disabling
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ad92f656bddff4cf8f641e0e3b1acd4eb9644cb ]
    
    This patch addresses an irq free warning and null pointer dereference
    error problem when nvme devices got timeout error during initialization.
    This problem happens when nvme_timeout() function is called while
    nvme_reset_work() is still in execution. This patch fixed the problem by
    setting flag of the problematic request to NVME_REQ_CANCELLED before
    calling nvme_dev_disable() to make sure __nvme_submit_sync_cmd() returns
    an error code and let nvme_submit_sync_cmd() fail gracefully.
    The following is console output.

    nvme-rdma: fix reset hang if controller died in the middle of a reset
    
    [ Upstream commit 2362acb6785611eda795bfc12e1ea6b202ecf62c ]
    
    If the controller becomes unresponsive in the middle of a reset, we
    will hang because we are waiting for the freeze to complete, but that
    cannot happen since we have commands that are inflight holding the
    q_usage_counter, and we can't blindly fail requests that times out.
    
    So give a timeout and if we cannot wait for queue freeze before
    unfreezing, fail and have the error handling take care how to
    proceed (either schedule a reconnect of remove the controller).

    nvme-rdma: fix timeout handler
    
    [ Upstream commit 0475a8dcbcee92a5d22e40c9c6353829fc6294b8 ]
    
    When a request times out in a LIVE state, we simply trigger error
    recovery and let the error recovery handle the request cancellation,
    however when a request times out in a non LIVE state, we make sure to
    complete it immediately as it might block controller setup or teardown
    and prevent forward progress.
    
    However tearing down the entire set of I/O and admin queues causes
    freeze/unfreeze imbalance (q->mq_freeze_depth) because and is really
    an overkill to what we actually need, which is to just fence controller
    teardown that may be running, stop the queue, and cancel the request if
    it is not already completed.
    
    Now that we have the controller teardown_lock, we can safely serialize
    request cancellation. This addresses a hang caused by calling extra
    queue freeze on controller namespaces, causing unfreeze to not complete
    correctly.

    nvme-tcp: fix reset hang if controller died in the middle of a reset
    
    [ Upstream commit e5c01f4f7f623e768e868bcc08d8e7ceb03b75d0 ]
    
    If the controller becomes unresponsive in the middle of a reset, we will
    hang because we are waiting for the freeze to complete, but that cannot
    happen since we have commands that are inflight holding the
    q_usage_counter, and we can't blindly fail requests that times out.
    
    So give a timeout and if we cannot wait for queue freeze before
    unfreezing, fail and have the error handling take care how to proceed
    (either schedule a reconnect of remove the controller).

    nvme-tcp: fix timeout handler
    
    [ Upstream commit 236187c4ed195161dfa4237c7beffbba0c5ae45b ]
    
    When a request times out in a LIVE state, we simply trigger error
    recovery and let the error recovery handle the request cancellation,
    however when a request times out in a non LIVE state, we make sure to
    complete it immediately as it might block controller setup or teardown
    and prevent forward progress.
    
    However tearing down the entire set of I/O and admin queues causes
    freeze/unfreeze imbalance (q->mq_freeze_depth) because and is really
    an overkill to what we actually need, which is to just fence controller
    teardown that may be running, stop the queue, and cancel the request if
    it is not already completed.
    
    Now that we have the controller teardown_lock, we can safely serialize
    request cancellation. This addresses a hang caused by calling extra
    queue freeze on controller namespaces, causing unfreeze to not complete
    correctly.

    nvmet-tcp: Fix NULL dereference when a connect data comes in h2cdata pdu
    
    [ Upstream commit a6ce7d7b4adaebc27ee7e78e5ecc378a1cfc221d ]
    
    When handling commands without in-capsule data, we assign the ttag
    assuming we already have the queue commands array allocated (based
    on the queue size information in the connect data payload). However
    if the connect itself did not send the connect data in-capsule we
    have yet to allocate the queue commands,and we will assign a bogus
    ttag and suffer a NULL dereference when we receive the corresponding
    h2cdata pdu.
    
    Fix this by checking if we already allocated commands before
    dereferencing it when handling h2cdata, if we didn't, its for sure a
    connect and we should use the preallocated connect command.

    drivers/net/wan/lapbether: Set network_header before transmitting
    
    [ Upstream commit 91244d108441013b7367b3b4dcc6869998676473 ]
    
    Set the skb's network_header before it is passed to the underlying
    Ethernet device for transmission.
    
    This patch fixes the following issue:
    
    When we use this driver with AF_PACKET sockets, there would be error
    messages of:
       protocol 0805 is buggy, dev (Ethernet interface name)
    printed in the system "dmesg" log.
    
    This is because skbs passed down to the Ethernet device for transmission
    don't have their network_header properly set, and the dev_queue_xmit_nit
    function in net/core/dev.c complains about this.
    
    Reason of setting the network_header to this place (at the end of the
    Ethernet header, and at the beginning of the Ethernet payload):
    
    Because when this driver receives an skb from the Ethernet device, the
    network_header is also set at this place.

    xfs: fix off-by-one in inode alloc block reservation calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit 657f101930bc6c5b41bd7d6c22565c4302a80d33 ]
    
    The inode chunk allocation transaction reserves inobt_maxlevels-1
    blocks to accommodate a full split of the inode btree. A full split
    requires an allocation for every existing level and a new root
    block, which means inobt_maxlevels is the worst case block
    requirement for a transaction that inserts to the inobt. This can
    lead to a transaction block reservation overrun when tmpfile
    creation allocates an inode chunk and expands the inobt to its
    maximum depth. This problem has been observed in conjunction with
    overlayfs, which makes frequent use of tmpfiles internally.
    
    The existing reservation code goes back as far as the Linux git repo
    history (v2.6.12). It was likely never observed as a problem because
    the traditional file/directory creation transactions also include
    worst case block reservation for directory modifications, which most
    likely is able to make up for a single block deficiency in the inode
    allocation portion of the calculation. tmpfile support is relatively
    more recent (v3.15), less heavily used, and only includes the inode
    allocation block reservation as tmpfiles aren't linked into the
    directory tree on creation.
    
    Fix up the inode alloc block reservation macro and a couple of the
    block allocator minleft parameters that enforce an allocation to
    leave enough free blocks in the AG for a full inobt split.

    direction after we allowed such a HEARTBEAT through, assume we are

    IB/isert: Fix unaligned immediate-data handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 0b089c1ef7047652b13b4cdfdb1e0e7dbdb8c9ab ]
    
    Currently we allocate rx buffers in a single contiguous buffers for
    headers (iser and iscsi) and data trailer. This means that most likely the
    data starting offset is aligned to 76 bytes (size of both headers).
    
    This worked fine for years, but at some point this broke, resulting in
    data corruptions in isert when a command comes with immediate data and the
    underlying backend device assumes 512 bytes buffer alignment.
    
    We assume a hard-requirement for all direct I/O buffers to be 512 bytes
    aligned. To fix this, we should avoid passing unaligned buffers for I/O.
    
    Instead, we allocate our recv buffers with some extra space such that we
    can have the data portion align to 512 byte boundary. This also means that
    we cannot reference headers or data using structure but rather
    accessors (as they may move based on alignment). Also, get rid of the
    wrong __packed annotation from iser_rx_desc as this has only harmful
    effects (not aligned to anything).
    
    This affects the rx descriptors for iscsi login and data plane.

    nvme-fabrics: allow to queue requests for live queues
    
    [ Upstream commit 73a5379937ec89b91e907bb315e2434ee9696a2c ]
    
    Right now we are failing requests based on the controller state (which
    is checked inline in nvmf_check_ready) however we should definitely
    accept requests if the queue is live.
    
    When entering controller reset, we transition the controller into
    NVME_CTRL_RESETTING, and then return BLK_STS_RESOURCE for non-mpath
    requests (have blk_noretry_request set).
    
    This is also the case for NVME_REQ_USER for the wrong reason. There
    shouldn't be any reason for us to reject this I/O in a controller reset.
    We do want to prevent passthru commands on the admin queue because we
    need the controller to fully initialize first before we let user passthru
    admin commands to be issued.
    
    In a non-mpath setup, this means that the requests will simply be
    requeued over and over forever not allowing the q_usage_counter to drop
    its final reference, causing controller reset to hang if running
    concurrently with heavy I/O.

    spi: stm32: Rate-limit the 'Communication suspended' message
    
    [ Upstream commit ea8be08cc9358f811e4175ba7fa7fea23c5d393e ]
    
    The 'spi_stm32 44004000.spi: Communication suspended' message means that
    when using PIO, the kernel did not read the FIFO fast enough and so the
    SPI controller paused the transfer. Currently, this is printed on every
    single such event, so if the kernel is busy and the controller is pausing
    the transfers often, the kernel will be all the more busy scrolling this
    message into the log buffer every few milliseconds. That is not helpful.
    
    Instead, rate-limit the message and print it every once in a while. It is
    not possible to use the default dev_warn_ratelimited(), because that is
    still too verbose, as it prints 10 lines (DEFAULT_RATELIMIT_BURST) every
    5 seconds (DEFAULT_RATELIMIT_INTERVAL). The policy here is to print 1 line
    every 50 seconds (DEFAULT_RATELIMIT_INTERVAL * 10), because 1 line is more
    than enough and the cycles saved on printing are better left to the CPU to
    handle the SPI. However, dev_warn_once() is also not useful, as the user
    should be aware that this condition is possibly recurring or ongoing. Thus
    the custom rate-limit policy.
    
    Finally, turn the message from dev_warn() to dev_dbg(), since the system
    does not suffer any sort of malfunction if this message appears, it is
    just slowing down. This further reduces the printing into the log buffer
    and frees the CPU to do useful work.

    mmc: sdhci-msm: Add retries when all tuning phases are found valid
    
    [ Upstream commit 9d5dcefb7b114d610aeb2371f6a6f119af316e43 ]
    
    As the comments in this patch say, if we tune and find all phases are
    valid it's _almost_ as bad as no phases being found valid.  Probably
    all phases are not really reliable but we didn't detect where the
    unreliable place is.  That means we'll essentially be guessing and
    hoping we get a good phase.
    
    This is not just a problem in theory.  It was causing real problems on
    a real board.  On that board, most often phase 10 is found as the only
    invalid phase, though sometimes 10 and 11 are invalid and sometimes
    just 11.  Some percentage of the time, however, all phases are found
    to be valid.  When this happens, the current logic will decide to use
    phase 11.  Since phase 11 is sometimes found to be invalid, this is a
    bad choice.  Sure enough, when phase 11 is picked we often get mmc
    errors later in boot.
    
    I have seen cases where all phases were found to be valid 3 times in a
    row, so increase the retry count to 10 just to be extra sure.

    [ Upstream commit 2cf9bfe9be75ed3656bbf882fb70c3e3047866e4 ]
    
    The commit 61d7437ed1390 ("mmc: sdhci-acpi: Fix HS400 tuning for AMDI0040")
    broke resume for eMMC HS400. When the system suspends the eMMC controller
    is powered down. So, on resume we need to reinitialize the controller.
    Although, amd_sdhci_host was not getting cleared, so the DLL was never
    re-enabled on resume. This results in HS400 being non-functional.
    
    To fix the problem, this change clears the tuned_clock flag, clears the
    dll_enabled flag and disables the DLL on reset.

    RDMA/core: Fix reported speed and width
    
    [ Upstream commit 28b0865714b315e318ac45c4fc9156f3d4649646 ]
    
    When the returned speed from __ethtool_get_link_ksettings() is
    SPEED_UNKNOWN this will lead to reporting a wrong speed and width for
    providers that uses ib_get_eth_speed(), fix that by defaulting the
    netdev_speed to SPEED_1000 in case the returned value from
    __ethtool_get_link_ksettings() is SPEED_UNKNOWN.
    
    Fixes: d41861942fc5 ("IB/core: Add generic function to extract IB speed from netdev")

    scsi: libsas: Set data_dir as DMA_NONE if libata marks qc as NODATA
    
    [ Upstream commit 53de092f47ff40e8d4d78d590d95819d391bf2e0 ]
    
    It was discovered that sdparm will fail when attempting to disable write
    cache on a SATA disk connected via libsas.
    
    In the ATA command set the write cache state is controlled through the SET
    FEATURES operation. This is roughly corresponds to MODE SELECT in SCSI and
    the latter command is what is used in the SCSI-ATA translation layer. A
    subtle difference is that a MODE SELECT carries data whereas SET FEATURES
    is defined as a non-data command in ATA.
    
    Set the DMA data direction to DMA_NONE if the requested ATA command is
    identified as non-data.

    Locking should be held for the entire reading sequence involving setting
    the channel, waiting for the channel switch and reading from the
    channel.
    If not, reading from a channel can result mixing with the reading from
    another channel.

    The following 4 tests in timers can take longer than the default 45
    seconds that added in commit 852c8cbf34d3 ("selftests/kselftest/runner.sh:

      * inconsistency-check - 1m45.074s
      * raw_skew - 2m0.013s
    
    Thus they will be marked as failed with the current 45s setting:
      not ok 3 selftests: timers: nsleep-lat # TIMEOUT
      not ok 4 selftests: timers: set-timer-lat # TIMEOUT
      not ok 6 selftests: timers: inconsistency-check # TIMEOUT
      not ok 7 selftests: timers: raw_skew # TIMEOUT
    
    Disable the timeout setting for timers can make these tests finish

    regulator: push allocation in regulator_ena_gpio_request() out of lock
    
    [ Upstream commit 467bf30142c64f2eb64e2ac67fa4595126230efd ]
    
    Move another allocation out of regulator_list_mutex-protected region, as
    reclaim might want to take the same lock.

    ARM: dts: logicpd-som-lv-baseboard: Fix missing video
    
    [ Upstream commit d1db7b80a6c8c5f81db0e80664d29b374750e2c6 ]
    
    A previous commit removed the panel-dpi driver, which made the
    SOM-LV video stop working because it relied on the DPI driver
    for setting video timings.  Now that the simple-panel driver is
    available in omap2plus, this patch migrates the SOM-LV dev kits
    to use a similar panel and remove the manual timing requirements.
    A similar patch was already done and applied to the Torpedo family.

    ARM: dts: logicpd-som-lv-baseboard: Fix broken audio
    
    [ Upstream commit 4d26e9a028e3d88223e06fa133c3d55af7ddbceb ]
    
    Older versions of U-Boot would pinmux the whole board, but as
    the bootloader got updated, it started to only pinmux the pins
    it needed, and expected Linux to configure what it needed.
    
    Unfortunately this caused an issue with the audio, because the
    mcbsp2 pins were configured in the device tree but never
    referenced by the driver. When U-Boot stopped muxing the audio
    pins, the audio died.
    
    This patch adds the references to the associate the pin controller
    with the mcbsp2 driver which makes audio operate again.
