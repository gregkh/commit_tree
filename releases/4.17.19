    reiserfs: fix broken xattr handling (heap corruption, bad retval)
    
    commit a13f085d111e90469faf2d9965eb39b11c114d7e upstream.
    
    This fixes the following issues:
    
    - When a buffer size is supplied to reiserfs_listxattr() such that each
      individual name fits, but the concatenation of all names doesn't fit,
      reiserfs_listxattr() overflows the supplied buffer.  This leads to a
      kernel heap overflow (verified using KASAN) followed by an out-of-bounds
      usercopy and is therefore a security bug.
    
    - When a buffer size is supplied to reiserfs_listxattr() such that a
      name doesn't fit, -ERANGE should be returned.  But reiserfs instead just
      truncates the list of names; I have verified that if the only xattr on a
      file has a longer name than the supplied buffer length, listxattr()
      incorrectly returns zero.
    
    With my patch applied, -ERANGE is returned in both cases and the memory
    corruption doesn't happen anymore.
    
    Credit for making me clean this code up a bit goes to Al Viro, who pointed
    out that the ->actor calling convention is suboptimal and should be
    changed.

    i2c: imx: Fix race condition in dma read
    
    commit bed4ff1ed4d8f2ef5007c5c6ae1b29c5677a3632 upstream.
    
    This fixes a race condition, where the DMAEN bit ends up being set after
    I2C slave has transmitted a byte following the dummy read.  When that
    happens, an interrupt is generated instead, and no DMA request is generated
    to kickstart the DMA read, and a timeout happens after DMA_TIMEOUT (1 sec).
    
    Fixed by setting the DMAEN bit before the dummy read.

    i2c: core: ACPI: Properly set status byte to 0 for multi-byte writes
    
    commit c463a158cb6c5d9a85b7d894cd4f8116e8bd6be0 upstream.
    
    acpi_gsb_i2c_write_bytes() returns i2c_transfer()'s return value, which
    is the number of transfers executed on success, so 1.
    
    The ACPI code expects us to store 0 in gsb->status for success, not 1.
    
    Specifically this breaks the following code in the Thinkpad 8 DSDT:
    
                ECWR = I2CW = ECWR /* \_SB_.I2C1.BAT0.ECWR */
                If ((ECST == Zero))
                {
                    ECRD = I2CR /* \_SB_.I2C1.I2CR */
                }
    
    Before this commit we set ECST to 1, causing the read to never happen
    breaking battery monitoring on the Thinkpad 8.
    
    This commit makes acpi_gsb_i2c_write_bytes() return 0 when i2c_transfer()
    returns 1, so the single write transfer completed successfully, and
    makes it return -EIO on for other (unexpected) return values >= 0.

    PCI: pciehp: Fix unprotected list iteration in IRQ handler
    
    commit 1204e35bedf4e5015cda559ed8c84789a6dae24e upstream.
    
    Commit b440bde74f04 ("PCI: Add pci_ignore_hotplug() to ignore hotplug
    events for a device") iterates over the devices on a hotplug port's
    subordinate bus in pciehp's IRQ handler without acquiring pci_bus_sem.
    It is thus possible for a user to cause a crash by concurrently
    manipulating the device list, e.g. by disabling slot power via sysfs
    on a different CPU or by initiating a remove/rescan via sysfs.
    
    This can't be fixed by acquiring pci_bus_sem because it may sleep.
    The simplest fix is to avoid the list iteration altogether and just
    check the ignore_hotplug flag on the port itself.  This works because
    pci_ignore_hotplug() sets the flag both on the device as well as on its
    parent bridge.
    
    We do lose the ability to print the name of the device blocking hotplug
    in the debug message, but that's probably bearable.

    PCI: pciehp: Fix use-after-free on unplug
    
    commit 281e878eab191cce4259abbbf1a0322e3adae02c upstream.
    
    When pciehp is unbound (e.g. on unplug of a Thunderbolt device), the
    hotplug_slot struct is deregistered and thus freed before freeing the
    IRQ.  The IRQ handler and the work items it schedules print the slot
    name referenced from the freed structure in various informational and
    debug log messages, each time resulting in a quadruple dereference of
    freed pointers (hotplug_slot -> pci_slot -> kobject -> name).
    
    At best the slot name is logged as "(null)", at worst kernel memory is
    exposed in logs or the driver crashes:
    
      pciehp 0000:10:00.0:pcie204: Slot((null)): Card not present
    
    An attacker may provoke the bug by unplugging multiple devices on a
    Thunderbolt daisy chain at once.  Unplugging can also be simulated by
    powering down slots via sysfs.  The bug is particularly easy to trigger
    in poll mode.
    
    It has been present since the driver's introduction in 2004:
    https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/c16b4b14d980
    
    Fix by rearranging teardown such that the IRQ is freed first.  Run the
    work items queued by the IRQ handler to completion before freeing the
    hotplug_slot struct by draining the work queue from the ->release_slot
    callback which is invoked by pci_hp_deregister().

    PCI: Skip MPS logic for Virtual Functions (VFs)
    
    commit 3dbe97efe8bf450b183d6dee2305cbc032e6b8a4 upstream.
    
    PCIe r4.0, sec 9.3.5.4, "Device Control Register", shows both
    Max_Payload_Size (MPS) and Max_Read_request_Size (MRRS) to be 'RsvdP' for
    VFs.  Just prior to the table it states:
    
      "PF and VF functionality is defined in Section 7.5.3.4 except where
       noted in Table 9-16.  For VF fields marked 'RsvdP', the PF setting
       applies to the VF."
    
    All of which implies that with respect to Max_Payload_Size Supported
    (MPSS), MPS, and MRRS values, we should not be paying any attention to the
    VF's fields, but rather only to the PF's.  Only looking at the PF's fields
    also logically makes sense as it's the sole physical interface to the PCIe
    bus.

    PCI: hotplug: Don't leak pci_slot on registration failure
    
    commit 4ce6435820d1f1cc2c2788e232735eb244bcc8a3 upstream.
    
    If addition of sysfs files fails on registration of a hotplug slot, the
    struct pci_slot as well as the entry in the slot_list is leaked.  The
    issue has been present since the hotplug core was introduced in 2002:
    https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/a8a2069f432c
    
    Perhaps the idea was that even though sysfs addition fails, the slot
    should still be usable.  But that's not how drivers use the interface,
    they abort probe if a non-zero value is returned.

    PCI / ACPI / PM: Resume all bridges on suspend-to-RAM
    
    commit 9d64b539b738fc181442caab95f1f76d9bd58539 upstream.
    
    Commit 26112ddc254c (PCI / ACPI / PM: Resume bridges w/o drivers on
    suspend-to-RAM) attempted to fix a functional regression resulting
    from commit c62ec4610c40 (PM / core: Fix direct_complete handling
    for devices with no callbacks) by resuming PCI bridges without
    drivers (that is, "parallel PCI" ones) during system-wide suspend if
    the target system state is not ACPI S0 (working state).
    
    That turns out insufficient, however, as it is reported that, at
    least in one case, the platform firmware gets confused if a PCIe
    root port is suspended before entering the ACPI S3 sleep state.
    That issue was exposed by commit 77b3729ca03 (PCI / PM: Use
    SMART_SUSPEND and LEAVE_SUSPENDED flags for PCIe ports) that allowed
    PCIe ports to stay in runtime suspend during system-wide suspend
    (which is OK for suspend-to-idle, but turns out to be problematic
    otherwise).
    
    For this reason, drop the driver check from acpi_pci_need_resume()
    and resume all bridges (including PCIe ports with drivers) during
    system-wide suspend if the target system state is not ACPI S0.
    
    [If the target system state is ACPI S0, it means suspend-to-idle
     and the platform firmware is not going to be invoked to actually
     suspend the system, so there is no need to resume the bridges in
     that case.]

    packet: refine ring v3 block size test to hold one frame
    
    commit 4576cd469d980317c4edd9173f8b694aa71ea3a3 upstream.
    
    TPACKET_V3 stores variable length frames in fixed length blocks.
    Blocks must be able to store a block header, optional private space
    and at least one minimum sized frame.
    
    Frames, even for a zero snaplen packet, store metadata headers and
    optional reserved space.
    
    In the block size bounds check, ensure that the frame of the
    chosen configuration fits. This includes sockaddr_ll and optional
    tp_reserve.
    
    Syzbot was able to construct a ring with insuffient room for the
    sockaddr_ll in the header of a zero-length frame, triggering an
    out-of-bounds write in dev_parse_header.
    
    Convert the comparison to less than, as zero is a valid snap len.
    This matches the test for minimum tp_frame_size immediately below.

    parisc: Remove ordered stores from syscall.S
    
    commit 7797167ffde1f00446301cb22b37b7c03194cfaf upstream.
    
    Now that we use a sync prior to releasing the locks in syscall.S, we don't need
    the PA 2.0 ordered stores used to release some locks.  Using an ordered store,
    potentially slows the release and subsequent code.
    
    There are a number of other ordered stores and loads that serve no purpose.  I
    have converted these to normal stores.

    parisc: Remove unnecessary barriers from spinlock.h
    
    commit 3b885ac1dc35b87a39ee176a6c7e2af9c789d8b8 upstream.
    
    Now that mb() is an instruction barrier, it will slow performance if we issue
    unnecessary barriers.
    
    The spinlock defines have a number of unnecessary barriers.  The __ldcw()
    define is both a hardware and compiler barrier.  The mb() barriers in the
    routines using __ldcw() serve no purpose.
    
    The only barrier needed is the one in arch_spin_unlock().  We need to ensure
    all accesses are complete prior to releasing the lock.

    drm/amdgpu/pm: Fix potential Spectre v1
    
    commit ddf74e79a54070f277ae520722d3bab7f7a6c67a upstream.
    
    idx can be indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading to a
    potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.
    
    This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:
    
    drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_pm.c:408 amdgpu_set_pp_force_state()
    warn: potential spectre issue 'data.states'
    
    Fix this by sanitizing idx before using it to index data.states
    
    Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
    to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
    completed with a dependent load/store [1].

    x86/mm/init: Remove freed kernel image areas from alias mapping
    
    commit c40a56a7818cfe735fc93a69e1875f8bba834483 upstream.
    
    The kernel image is mapped into two places in the virtual address space
    (addresses without KASLR, of course):
    
            1. The kernel direct map (0xffff880000000000)
            2. The "high kernel map" (0xffffffff81000000)
    
    We actually execute out of #2.  If we get the address of a kernel symbol,
    it points to #2, but almost all physical-to-virtual translations point to
    
    Parts of the "high kernel map" alias are mapped in the userspace page
    tables with the Global bit for performance reasons.  The parts that we map
    to userspace do not (er, should not) have secrets. When PTI is enabled then
    the global bit is usually not set in the high mapping and just used to
    compensate for poor performance on systems which lack PCID.
    
    This is fine, except that some areas in the kernel image that are adjacent
    to the non-secret-containing areas are unused holes.  We free these holes
    back into the normal page allocator and reuse them as normal kernel memory.
    The memory will, of course, get *used* via the normal map, but the alias
    mapping is kept.
    
    This otherwise unused alias mapping of the holes will, by default keep the
    Global bit, be mapped out to userspace, and be vulnerable to Meltdown.
    
    Remove the alias mapping of these pages entirely.  This is likely to
    fracture the 2M page mapping the kernel image near these areas, but this
    should affect a minority of the area.
    
    The pageattr code changes *all* aliases mapping the physical pages that it
    operates on (by default).  We only want to modify a single alias, so we
    need to tweak its behavior.
    
    This unmapping behavior is currently dependent on PTI being in place.
    Going forward, we should at least consider doing this for all
    configurations.  Having an extra read-write alias for memory is not exactly
    ideal for debugging things like random memory corruption and this does
    undercut features like DEBUG_PAGEALLOC or future work like eXclusive Page
    Frame Ownership (XPFO).

    commit 6ea2738e0ca0e626c75202fb051c1e88d7a950fa upstream.
    
    When chunks of the kernel image are freed, free_init_pages() is used
    directly.  Consolidate the three sites that do this.  Also update the
    string to give an incrementally better description of that memory versus
    what was there before.

    x86/mm/init: Pass unconverted symbol addresses to free_init_pages()
    
    commit 9f515cdb411ef34f1aaf4c40bb0c932cf6db5de1 upstream.
    
    The x86 code has several places where it frees parts of kernel image:
    
     1. Unused SMP alternative
     2. __init code
     3. The hole between text and rodata
     4. The hole between rodata and data
    
    We call free_init_pages() to do this.  Strangely, we convert the symbol
    addresses to kernel direct map addresses in some cases (#3, #4) but not
    others (#1, #2).
    
    The virt_to_page() and the other code in free_reserved_area() now works
    fine for for symbol addresses on x86, so don't bother converting the
    addresses to direct map addresses before freeing them.

    mm: Allow non-direct-map arguments to free_reserved_area()
    
    commit 0d83432811f26871295a9bc24d3c387924da6071 upstream.
    
    free_reserved_area() takes pointers as arguments to show which addresses
    should be freed.  However, it does this in a somewhat ambiguous way.  If it
    gets a kernel direct map address, it always works.  However, if it gets an
    address that is part of the kernel image alias mapping, it can fail.
    
    It fails if all of the following happen:
     * The specified address is part of the kernel image alias
     * Poisoning is requested (forcing a memset())
     * The address is in a read-only portion of the kernel image
    
    The memset() fails on the read-only mapping, of course.
    free_reserved_area() *is* called both on the direct map and on kernel image
    alias addresses.  We've just lucked out thus far that the kernel image
    alias areas it gets used on are read-write.  I'm fairly sure this has been
    just a happy accident.
    
    It is quite easy to make free_reserved_area() work for all cases: just
    convert the address to a direct map address before doing the memset(), and
    do this unconditionally.  There is little chance of a regression here
    because we previously did a virt_to_page() on the address for the memset,
    so we know these are not highmem pages for which virt_to_page() would fail.

    mm: use helper functions for allocating and freeing vm_area structs
    
    [ Upstream commit 3928d4f5ee37cdc523894f6e549e6aae521d8980 ]
    
    The vm_area_struct is one of the most fundamental memory management
    objects, but the management of it is entirely open-coded evertwhere,
    ranging from allocation and freeing (using kmem_cache_[z]alloc and
    kmem_cache_free) to initializing all the fields.
    
    We want to unify this in order to end up having some unified
    initialization of the vmas, and the first step to this is to at least
    have basic allocation functions.
    
    Right now those functions are literally just wrappers around the
    kmem_cache_*() calls.  This is a purely mechanical conversion:
    
        # new vma:
        kmem_cache_zalloc(vm_area_cachep, GFP_KERNEL) -> vm_area_alloc()
    
        # copy old vma
        kmem_cache_alloc(vm_area_cachep, GFP_KERNEL) -> vm_area_dup(old)
    
        # free vma
        kmem_cache_free(vm_area_cachep, vma) -> vm_area_free(vma)
    
    to the point where the old vma passed in to the vm_area_dup() function
    isn't even used yet (because I've left all the old manual initialization
    alone).

    [ Upstream commit 2502e5a025935b7b476b69eda4959b3c4022c72b ]
    
    Fix return code check for "max brightness" ACPI call.
    
    The Dell laptop ACPI video brightness control is not present on dell
    laptops anymore, but was present in older kernel versions.
    
    The code that checks the return value is incorrect since the SMM
    refactoring.
    
    The old code was:
      if (buffer->output[0] == 0)
    
    Which was changed to:
      ret = dell_send_request(...)
      if (ret)
    
    However, dell_send_request() will return 0 if buffer->output[0] == 0,
    so we must change the check to:
      if (ret == 0)
    
    This issue was found on a Dell M4800 laptop, and the fix tested on it
    as well.

    ARM: dts: imx6: RDU2: fix irq type for mv88e6xxx switch
    
    [ Upstream commit e01a06c8089132bb4da035c6a83df23916ca3ebf ]
    
    The Marvell switches report their interrupts in a level sensitive way.
    When using edge sensitive detection a race condition in the interrupt
    handler of the swich might result in the OS to miss all future events
    which might make the switch non-functional.
    
    The problem is that both mv88e6xxx_g2_irq_thread_fn() and
    mv88e6xxx_g1_irq_thread_work() sample the irq cause register
    (MV88E6XXX_G2_INT_SRC and MV88E6XXX_G1_STS respectively) once and then
    handle the observed sources. If after sampling but before all observed
    irq sources are handled a new irq source gets active this is not noticed
    by the handler which returns unsuspecting, but the interrupt line stays
    active which prevents the edge detector to kick in.
    
    All device trees but imx6qdl-zii-rdu2 get this right (most of them by
    not specifying an interrupt parent). So fix imx6qdl-zii-rdu2
    accordingly.

    net: qca_spi: Fix log level if probe fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 50973993260a6934f0a00da53d9b746cfbea89ab ]
    
    In cases the probing fails the log level of the messages should
    be an error.

    net: qca_spi: Make sure the QCA7000 reset is triggered
    
    [ Upstream commit 711c62dfa6bdb4326ca6c587f295ea5c4f7269de ]
    
    In case the SPI thread is not running, a simple reset of sync
    state won't fix the transmit timeout. We also need to wake up the kernel
    thread.

    net: qca_spi: Avoid packet drop during initial sync
    
    [ Upstream commit b2bab426dc715de147f8039a3fccff27d795f4eb ]
    
    As long as the synchronization with the QCA7000 isn't finished, we
    cannot accept packets from the upper layers. So let the SPI thread
    enable the TX queue after sync and avoid unwanted packet drop.

    It turned out that pci_remap_iospace() wasn't undone when the driver's
    probe failed, and since devm_phy_optional_get() returned -EPROBE_DEFER,
    the probe was retried, finally causing the BUG due to trying to remap
    already remapped pages.
    
    Introduce the devm_pci_remap_iospace() managed API and replace the
    pci_remap_iospace() call with it to fix the bug.

    kvmclock: fix TSC calibration for nested guests
    
    [ Upstream commit e10f7805032365cc11c739a97f226ebb48aee042 ]
    
    Inside a nested guest, access to hardware can be slow enough that
    tsc_read_refs always return ULLONG_MAX, causing tsc_refine_calibration_work
    to be called periodically and the nested guest to spend a lot of time
    reading the ACPI timer.
    
    However, if the TSC frequency is available from the pvclock page,
    we can just set X86_FEATURE_TSC_KNOWN_FREQ and avoid the recalibration.
    'refine' operation.

    octeon_mgmt: Fix MIX registers configuration on MTU setup
    
    [ Upstream commit 4aac0b43474d18f6160302a3caa147d77fa3baa1 ]
    
    octeon_mgmt driver doesn't drop RX frames that are 1-4 bytes bigger than
    MTU set for the corresponding interface. The problem is in the
    AGL_GMX_RX0/1_FRM_MAX register setting, which should not account for VLAN
    tagging.
    
    According to Octeon HW manual:
    "For tagged frames, MAX increases by four bytes for each VLAN found up to a
    maximum of two VLANs, or MAX + 8 bytes."
    
    OCTEON_FRAME_HEADER_LEN "define" is fine for ring buffer management, but
    should not be used for AGL_GMX_RX0/1_FRM_MAX.
    
    The problem could be easily reproduced using "ping" command. If affected
    system has default MTU 1500, other host (having MTU >= 1504) can
    successfully "ping" the affected system with payload size 1473-1476,
    resulting in IP packets of size 1501-1504 accepted by the mgmt driver.
    Fixed system still accepts IP packets of 1500 bytes even with VLAN tagging,
    because the limits are lifted in HW as expected, for every VLAN tag.

    btrfs: scrub: Don't use inode page cache in scrub_handle_errored_block()
    
    [ Upstream commit 665d4953cde6d9e75c62a07ec8f4f8fd7d396ade ]
    
    In commit ac0b4145d662 ("btrfs: scrub: Don't use inode pages for device
    replace") we removed the branch of copy_nocow_pages() to avoid
    corruption for compressed nodatasum extents.
    
    However above commit only solves the problem in scrub_extent(), if
    during scrub_pages() we failed to read some pages,
    sctx->no_io_error_seen will be non-zero and we go to fixup function
    scrub_handle_errored_block().
    
    In scrub_handle_errored_block(), for sctx without csum (no matter if
    we're doing replace or scrub) we go to scrub_fixup_nodatasum() routine,
    which does the similar thing with copy_nocow_pages(), but does it
    without the extra check in copy_nocow_pages() routine.
    
    So for test cases like btrfs/100, where we emulate read errors during
    replace/scrub, we could corrupt compressed extent data again.
    
    This patch will fix it just by avoiding any "optimization" for
    nodatasum, just falls back to the normal fixup routine by try read from
    any good copy.
    
    This also solves WARN_ON() or dead lock caused by lame backref iteration
    in scrub_fixup_nodatasum() routine.
    
    The deadlock or WARN_ON() won't be triggered before commit ac0b4145d662
    ("btrfs: scrub: Don't use inode pages for device replace") since
    copy_nocow_pages() have better locking and extra check for data extent,
    and it's already doing the fixup work by try to read data from any good
    copy, so it won't go scrub_fixup_nodatasum() anyway.
    
    This patch disables the faulty code and will be removed completely in a
    followup patch.

    ibmvnic: Fix error recovery on login failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 3578a7ecb69920efc3885dbd610e98c00dbdf5db ]
    
    Testing has uncovered a failure case that is not handled properly. In the
    event that a login fails and we are not able to recover on the spot, we
    return 0 from do_reset, preventing any error recovery code from being
    triggered.  Additionally, the state is set to "probed" meaning that when we
    are able to trigger the error recovery, the driver always comes up in the
    probed state. To handle the case properly, we need to return a failure code
    here and set the adapter state to the state that we entered the reset in
    indicating the state that we would like to come out of the recovery reset
    in.

    [ Upstream commit 2d14d3795294d42aacc278948984a480569bcc23 ]
    
    During a device failover, there may be latency between the loss
    of the current backing device and a notification from firmware that
    a failover has occurred. This latency can result in a large amount of
    error printouts as firmware returns outgoing traffic with a generic
    error code. These are not necessarily errors in this case as the
    firmware is busy swapping in a new backing adapter and is not ready
    to send packets yet. This patch reclassifies those error codes as
    warnings with an explanation that a failover may be pending. All
    other return codes will be considered errors.

    syzkaller reproducer runs a bunch of threads that constantly switch
    between DEADLINE and NORMAL classes while interacting through futexes.
    
    The splat above is caused by the fact that if a DEADLINE task is setattr
    back to NORMAL while in non_contending state (blocked on a futex -
    inactive timer armed), its contribution to running_bw is not removed
    before sub_rq_bw() gets called (!task_on_rq_queued() branch) and the
    latter sees running_bw > this_bw.
    
    Fix it by removing a task contribution from running_bw if the task is
    not queued and in non_contending state while switched to a different
    class.

    kvm: nVMX: Restore exit qual for VM-entry failure due to MSR loading
    
    [ Upstream commit 0b88abdc3f964c28ec03bc69eb17cb6b3b034564 ]
    
    This exit qualification was inadvertently dropped when the two
    VM-entry failure blocks were coalesced.

    net/9p/client.c: put refcount of trans_mod in error case in parse_opts()
    
    [ Upstream commit c290fba8c4ce6530cd941ea14db5a4ac2f77183f ]
    
    In my testing, the second mount will fail after umounting successfully.
    The reason is that we put refcount of trans_mod in the correct case
    rather than the error case in parse_opts() at last.  That will cause the
    refcount decrease to -1, and when we try to get trans_mod again in
    try_module_get(), we could only increase refcount to 0 which will cause
    failure as follows:
    
    parse_opts
      v9fs_get_trans_by_name
        try_module_get : return NULL to caller which cause error
    
    So we should put refcount of trans_mod in error case.

    [ Upstream commit 1c56c0994a533ce564843a0d17af7a3e6e68f269 ]
    
    In some situations we may end up calling down_read while already
    holding the semaphore for write, thus hanging. This has been seen
    when setting the MAC address for the interface. The hung task log
    in this situation includes this stack:
      down_read
      efx_ef10_filter_insert
      efx_ef10_filter_insert_addr_list
      efx_ef10_filter_vlan_sync_rx_mode

      efx_ef10_set_mac_address
      efx_set_mac_address
      dev_set_mac_address
    
    In addition, lockdep rightly points out that nested calling of
    down_read is incorrect.

    [ Upstream commit 2f8b5b21830aea95989a6e67d8a971297272a086 ]
    
    Call secure services to enable ACTLR[0] (Enable invalidates of BTB with
    ICIALLU) when branch hardening is enabled for kernel.
    
    On GP devices OMAP5/DRA7, there is no possibility to update secure
    side since "secure world" is ROM and there are no override mechanisms
    possible. On HS devices, appropriate PPA should do the workarounds as
    well.
    
    However, the configuration is only done for secondary core, since it is
    expected that firmware/bootloader will have enabled the required
    configuration for the primary boot core (note: bootloaders typically
    will NOT enable secondary processors, since it has no need to do so).

    sfp: fix module initialisation with netdev already up
    
    [ Upstream commit 576cd32082351620a4e76b8babc4d5ae9b4bbb98 ]
    
    It was been observed that with a particular order of initialisation,
    the netdev can be up, but the SFP module still has its TX_DISABLE
    signal asserted.  This occurs when the network device brought up before
    the SFP kernel module has been inserted by userspace.
    
    This occurs because sfp-bus layer does not hear about the change in
    network device state, and so assumes that it is still down.  Set
    netdev->sfp when the upstream is registered to work around this problem.

    [ Upstream commit f20a4c46b984331a509528fa2b84125c617ef98b ]
    
    We fail to correctly clean up after a bus registration failure, which
    can lead to an incorrect assumption about the registration state of
    the upstream or sfp cage.

    ARM: 8780/1: ftrace: Only set kernel memory back to read-only after boot
    
    [ Upstream commit b4c7e2bd2eb4764afe3af9409ff3b1b87116fa30 ]
    
    Dynamic ftrace requires modifying the code segments that are usually
    set to read-only. To do this, a per arch function is called both before
    and after the ftrace modifications are performed. The "before" function
    will set kernel code text to read-write to allow for ftrace to make the
    modifications, and the "after" function will set the kernel code text
    back to "read-only" to keep the kernel code text protected.
    
    The issue happens when dynamic ftrace is tested at boot up. The test is
    done before the kernel code text has been set to read-only. But the
    "before" and "after" calls are still performed. The "after" call will
    change the kernel code text to read-only prematurely, and other boot
    code that expects this code to be read-write will fail.
    
    The solution is to add a variable that is set when the kernel code text
    is expected to be converted to read-only, and make the ftrace "before"
    and "after" calls do nothing if that variable is not yet set. This is
    similar to the x86 solution from commit 162396309745 ("ftrace, x86:
    make kernel text writable only for conversions").

    perf tools: Use python-config --includes rather than --cflags
    
    [ Upstream commit 32aa928a7b817140c84987b726d5014911808fa4 ]
    
    Builds started failing in Fedora on Python 3.7 with:
    
        `.gnu.debuglto_.debug_macro' referenced in section
        `.gnu.debuglto_.debug_macro' of
        util/scripting-engines/trace-event-python.o: defined in discarded
        section
    
    In Fedora, Python 3.7 added -flto to the list of --cflags and since it
    was only applied to util/scripting-engines/trace-event-python.c and
    scripts/python/Perf-Trace-Util/Context.c, linking failed.
    
    It's not the first time the addition of flags has broken builds: commit
    c6707fdef7e2 ("perf tools: Fix up build in hardnened environments")
    appears to have fixed a similar problem. "python-config --includes"
    provides the proper -I flags and doesn't introduce additional CFLAGS.

    perf script python: Fix dict reference counting
    
    [ Upstream commit db0ba84c04ef2cf293aaada5ae97531127844d9d ]
    
    The dictionaries are attached to the parameter tuple that steals the
    references and takes care of releasing them when appropriate.  The code
    should not decrement the reference counts explicitly.  E.g. if libpython
    has been built with reference debugging enabled, the superfluous DECREFs
    will trigger this error when running perf script:
    
      Fatal Python error: Objects/tupleobject.c:238 object at
      0x7f10f2041b40 has negative ref count -1
      Aborted (core dumped)
    
    If the reference debugging is not enabled, the superfluous DECREFs might
    cause the dict objects to be silently released while they are still in
    use. This may trigger various other assertions or just cause perf
    crashes and/or weird and unexpected data changes in the stored Python
    objects.

    bnxt_en: Do not modify max IRQ count after RDMA driver requests/frees IRQs.
    
    [ Upstream commit 30f529473ec962102e8bcd33a6a04f1e1b490ae2 ]
    
    Calling bnxt_set_max_func_irqs() to modify the max IRQ count requested or
    freed by the RDMA driver is flawed.  The max IRQ count is checked when
    re-initializing the IRQ vectors and this can happen multiple times
    during ifup or ethtool -L.  If the max IRQ is reduced and the RDMA
    driver is operational, we may not initailize IRQs correctly.  This
    problem shows up on VFs with very small number of MSIX.
    
    There is no other logic that relies on the IRQ count excluding the ones
    used by RDMA.  So we fix it by just removing the call to subtract or
    add the IRQs used by RDMA.

    bnxt_en: Fix inconsistent BNXT_FLAG_AGG_RINGS logic.
    
    [ Upstream commit 07f4fde53d12eb8d921b465bb298e964e0bdc38c ]
    
    If there aren't enough RX rings available, the driver will attempt to
    use a single RX ring without the aggregation ring.  If that also
    fails, the BNXT_FLAG_AGG_RINGS flag is cleared but the other ring
    parameters are not set consistently to reflect that.  If more RX
    rings become available at the next open, the RX rings will be in
    an inconsistent state and may crash when freeing the RX rings.
    
    Fix it by restoring the BNXT_FLAG_AGG_RINGS if not enough RX rings are
    available to run without aggregation rings.

    It is possible that OVS may set don’t care for DEI/CFI bit in
    vlan_tci mask. Hence, checking for vlan_tci exact match will endup
    in a vlan flow rejection.

    ARC: Improve cmpxchg syscall implementation
    
    [ Upstream commit e8708786d4fe21c043d38d760f768949a3d71185 ]
    
    This is used in configs lacking hardware atomics to emulate atomic r-m-w
    for user space, implemented by disabling preemption in kernel.
    
    However there are issues in current implementation:
    
    1. Process not terminated if invalid user pointer passed:
       i.e. __get_user() failed.
    
    2. The reason for this patch was __put_user() failure not being handled
       either, specifically for the COW break scenario.
       The zero page is initially wired up and read from __get_user()
       succeeds. A subsequent write by __put_user() induces a
       Protection Violation, but COW can't finish as Linux page fault
       handler is disabled due to preempt disable.
       And what's worse is we silently return the stale value to user space.
       Fix this specific case by re-enabling preemption and explicitly
       fixing up the fault and retrying the whole sequence over.

    ARC: [plat-hsdk]: Configure APB GPIO controller on ARC HSDK platform
    
    [ Upstream commit ec58ba16e174d7ca24c8955a21cd0a53e0c32fdf ]
    
    In case of HSDK we have intermediate INTC in for of DW APB GPIO controller
    which is used as a de-bounce logic for interrupt wires that come from
    outside the board.
    
    We cannot use existing "irq-dw-apb-ictl" driver here because all input
    lines are routed to corresponding output lines but not muxed into one
    line (this is configured in RTL and we cannot change this in software).
    
    But even if we add such a feature to "irq-dw-apb-ictl" driver that won't
    benefit us as higher-level INTC (in case of HSDK it is IDU) anyways has
    per-input control so adding fully-controller intermediate INTC will only
    bring some overhead on interrupt processing but no other benefits.
    
    Thus we just do one-time configuration of DW APB GPIO controller and
    forget about it.
    
    Based on implementation available on arch/arc/plat-axs10x/axs10x.c file.

    netfilter: nf_conntrack: Fix possible possible crash on module loading.
    
    [ Upstream commit 2045cdfa1b40d66f126f3fd05604fc7c754f0022 ]
    
    Loading the nf_conntrack module with doubled hashsize parameter, i.e.
              modprobe nf_conntrack hashsize=12345 hashsize=12345
    causes NULL-ptr deref.
    
    If 'hashsize' specified twice, the nf_conntrack_set_hashsize() function
    will be called also twice.
    The first nf_conntrack_set_hashsize() call will set the
    'nf_conntrack_htable_size' variable:
    
            nf_conntrack_set_hashsize()
                    ...
                    /* On boot, we can set this without any fancy locking. */
                    if (!nf_conntrack_htable_size)
                            return param_set_uint(val, kp);
    
    But on the second invocation, the nf_conntrack_htable_size is already set,
    so the nf_conntrack_set_hashsize() will take a different path and call
    the nf_conntrack_hash_resize() function. Which will crash on the attempt
    to dereference 'nf_conntrack_hash' pointer:
    
            BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000000
            RIP: 0010:nf_conntrack_hash_resize+0x255/0x490 [nf_conntrack]
            Call Trace:
             nf_conntrack_set_hashsize+0xcd/0x100 [nf_conntrack]
             parse_args+0x1f9/0x5a0
             load_module+0x1281/0x1a50
             __se_sys_finit_module+0xbe/0xf0
             do_syscall_64+0x7c/0x390
             entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x49/0xbe
    
    Fix this, by checking !nf_conntrack_hash instead of
    !nf_conntrack_htable_size. nf_conntrack_hash will be initialized only
    after the module loaded, so the second invocation of the
    nf_conntrack_set_hashsize() won't crash, it will just reinitialize
    nf_conntrack_htable_size again.

    Host1x's CDMA can't access the command buffers if IOMMU and Host1x
    firewall are enabled in the kernels config because firewall doesn't map

    bpf: fix sk_skb programs without skb->dev assigned
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c6bc6e531a6db36f49622f1f115770160f7afb0 ]
    
    Multiple BPF helpers in use by sk_skb programs calculate the max
    skb length using the __bpf_skb_max_len function. However, this
    calculates the max length using the skb->dev pointer which can be
    NULL when an sk_skb program is paired with an sk_msg program.
    
    To force this a sk_msg program needs to redirect into the ingress
    path of a sock with an attach sk_skb program. Then the the sk_skb
    program would need to call one of the helpers that adjust the skb
    size.
    
    To fix the null ptr dereference use SKB_MAX_ALLOC size if no dev
    is available.

    nvmem: Don't let a NULL cell_id for nvmem_cell_get() crash us
    
    [ Upstream commit 87ed1405ef09d29a14df43295f7b6a93b63bfe6e ]
    
    In commit ca04d9d3e1b1 ("phy: qcom-qusb2: New driver for QUSB2 PHY on
    Qcom chips") you can see a call like:
    
      devm_nvmem_cell_get(dev, NULL);
    
    Note that the cell ID passed to the function is NULL.  This is because
    the qcom-qusb2 driver is expected to work only on systems where the
    PHY node is hooked up via device-tree and is nameless.
    
    This works OK for the most part.  The first thing nvmem_cell_get()
    does is to call of_nvmem_cell_get() and there it's documented that a
    NULL name is fine.  The problem happens when the call to
    of_nvmem_cell_get() returns -EINVAL.  In such a case we'll fall back
    to nvmem_cell_get_from_list() and eventually might (if nvmem_cells
    isn't an empty list) crash with something that looks like:
    
     strcmp
     nvmem_find_cell
     __nvmem_device_get
     nvmem_cell_get_from_list
     nvmem_cell_get
     devm_nvmem_cell_get
     qusb2_phy_probe
    
    There are several different ways we could fix this problem:
    
    One could argue that perhaps the qcom-qusb2 driver should be changed
    to use of_nvmem_cell_get() which is allowed to have a NULL name.  In
    that case, we'd need to add a patche to introduce
    devm_of_nvmem_cell_get() since the qcom-qusb2 driver is using devm
    managed resources.
    
    One could also argue that perhaps we could just add a name to
    qcom-qusb2.  That would be OK but I believe it effectively changes the
    device tree bindings, so maybe it's a no-go.
    
    In this patch I have chosen to fix the problem by simply not crashing
    when a NULL cell_id is passed to nvmem_cell_get().
    
    NOTE: that for the qcom-qusb2 driver the "nvmem-cells" property is
    defined to be optional and thus it's expected to be a common case that
    we would hit this crash and this is more than just a theoretical fix.

    net/sched: act_tunnel_key: fix NULL dereference when 'goto chain' is used
    
    [ Upstream commit 38230a3e0e0933bbcf5df6fa469ba0667f667568 ]
    
    the control action in the common member of struct tcf_tunnel_key must be a
    valid value, as it can contain the chain index when 'goto chain' is used.
    Ensure that the control action can be read as x->tcfa_action, when x is a
    pointer to struct tc_action and x->ops->type is TCA_ACT_TUNNEL_KEY, to
    prevent the following command:
    
     # tc filter add dev $h2 ingress protocol ip pref 1 handle 101 flower \
     > $tcflags dst_mac $h2mac action tunnel_key unset goto chain 1
    
    from causing a NULL dereference when a matching packet is received:

    ARM: pxa: irq: fix handling of ICMR registers in suspend/resume
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c1049dcb4ceec640d8bd797335bcbebdcab44d2 ]
    
    PXA3xx platforms have 56 interrupts that are stored in two ICMR
    registers. The code in pxa_irq_suspend() and pxa_irq_resume() however
    does a simple division by 32 which only leads to one register being
    saved at suspend and restored at resume time. The NAND interrupt
    setting, for instance, is lost.
    
    Fix this by using DIV_ROUND_UP() instead.

    cxgb4: assume flash part size to be 4MB, if it can't be determined
    
    [ Upstream commit 843789f6dd6ae1651a77ac99c13bcaf191ebe05c ]
    
    t4_get_flash_params() fails in a fatal fashion if the FLASH part isn't
    one of the recognized parts. But this leads to desperate efforts to update
    drivers when various FLASH parts which we are using suddenly become
    unavailable and we need to substitute new FLASH parts.  This has lead to
    more than one Customer Field Emergency when a Customer has an old driver
    and suddenly can't use newly shipped adapters.
    
    This commit fixes this by simply assuming that the FLASH part is 4MB in
    size if it can't be identified. Note that all Chelsio adapters will have
    flash parts which are at least 4MB in size.

    tipc: fix correct setting of message type in second discoverer
    
    [ Upstream commit 92018c7ca959ccd346d6235dac03cf7fc1ba51f7 ]
    
    The duplicate address discovery protocol is not safe against two
    discoverers running in parallel. The one executing first after the
    trial period is over will set the node address and change its own
    message type to DSC_REQ_MSG. The one executing last may find that the
    node address is already set, and never change message type, with the
    result that its links may never be established.
    
    In this commmit we ensure that the message type always is set correctly
    after the trial period is over.

    [ Upstream commit e415577f57f4452150642500364cbe5fa6112813 ]
    
    With the duplicate address discovery protocol for tipc nodes addresses
    we introduced a one second trial period before a node is allocated a
    hash number to use as address.
    
    Unfortunately, we miss to handle the case when a regular LINK REQUEST/
    RESPONSE arrives from a cluster node during the trial period. Such
    messages are not ignored as they should be, leading to links setup
    attempts while the node still has no address.

    The function for checking if there is an node address conflict is
    supposed to return a suggestion for a new address if it finds a
    conflict, and zero otherwise. But in case the peer being checked
    is previously unknown it does instead return a "suggestion" for
    the checked address itself. This results in a DSC_TRIAL_FAIL_MSG
    being sent unecessarily to the peer, and sometimes makes the trial
    period starting over again.

    ravb: fix invalid context bug while changing link options by ethtool
    
    [ Upstream commit 05925e52a7d379192a5fdff2c33710f573190ead ]
    
    The change fixes sleep in atomic context bug, which is encountered
    every time when link settings are changed by ethtool.
    
    Since commit 35b5f6b1a82b ("PHYLIB: Locking fixes for PHY I/O
    potentially sleeping") phy_start_aneg() function utilizes a mutex
    to serialize changes to phy state, however that helper function is
    called in atomic context under a grabbed spinlock, because
    phy_start_aneg() is called by phy_ethtool_ksettings_set() and by
    replaced phy_ethtool_sset() helpers from phylib.
    
    Now duplex mode setting is enforced in ravb_adjust_link() only, also
    now RX/TX is disabled when link is put down or modifications to E-MAC
    registers ECMR and GECMR are expected for both cases of checked and
    ignored link status pin state from E-MAC interrupt handler.

    While not present in the backtrace, ipv6_renew_option() ends up calling
    access_ok() via the following chain:
    
      access_ok()
      _copy_from_user()
      copy_from_user()
      ipv6_renew_option()
    
    The fix presented in this patch is to perform the userspace copy
    earlier in the call chain such that it is only called when the option
    data is actually coming from userspace; that place is
    do_ipv6_setsockopt().  Not only does this solve the problem seen in
    the backtrace above, it also allows us to simplify the code quite a
    bit by removing ipv6_renew_options_kern() completely.  We also take
    this opportunity to cleanup ipv6_renew_options()/ipv6_renew_option()
    a small amount as well.
    
    This patch is heavily based on a rough patch by Al Viro.  I've taken
    his original patch, converted a kmemdup() call in do_ipv6_setsockopt()
    to a memdup_user() call, made better use of the e_inval jump target in
    the same function, and cleaned up the use ipv6_renew_option() by
    ipv6_renew_options().

    [ Upstream commit fdddc65ab35d575b42aab411b2dc687601eab680 ]
    
    Current implementation does not guarantee packed pixel modes working
    with every dongle. There are some dongles, which require selecting
    the output mode explicitly.
    
    Write proper values to registers in packed_pixel mode, based on how it
    is done in vendor's code. Select output color space: RGB
    (no packed pixel) or YCBCR422 (packed pixel).

    kasan: fix shadow_size calculation error in kasan_module_alloc
    
    [ Upstream commit 1e8e18f694a52d703665012ca486826f64bac29d ]
    
    There is a special case that the size is "(N << KASAN_SHADOW_SCALE_SHIFT)
    Pages plus X", the value of X is [1, KASAN_SHADOW_SCALE_SIZE-1].  The
    operation "size >> KASAN_SHADOW_SCALE_SHIFT" will drop X, and the
    roundup operation can not retrieve the missed one page.  For example:
    size=0x28006, PAGE_SIZE=0x1000, KASAN_SHADOW_SCALE_SHIFT=3, we will get
    shadow_size=0x5000, but actually we need 6 pages.
    
      shadow_size = round_up(size >> KASAN_SHADOW_SCALE_SHIFT, PAGE_SIZE);
    
    This can lead to a kernel crash when kasan is enabled and the value of
    mod->core_layout.size or mod->init_layout.size is like above.  Because
    the shadow memory of X has not been allocated and mapped.
    
    move_module:
      ptr = module_alloc(mod->core_layout.size);
      ...
      memset(ptr, 0, mod->core_layout.size);                //crashed

    HID: wacom: Correct touch maximum XY of 2nd-gen Intuos
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b8d573586d1b9dee33edf6cb6f2ca05f4bca568 ]
    
    The touch sensors on the 2nd-gen Intuos tablets don't use a 4096x4096
    sensor like other similar tablets (3rd-gen Bamboo, Intuos5, etc.).
    The incorrect maximum XY values don't normally affect userspace since
    touch input from these devices is typically relative rather than
    absolute. It does, however, cause problems when absolute distances
    need to be measured, e.g. for gesture recognition. Since the resolution
    of the touch sensor on these devices is 10 units / mm (versus 100 for
    the pen sensor), the proper maximum values can be calculated by simply
    dividing by 10.

    x86/mm/32: Initialize the CR4 shadow before __flush_tlb_all()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4fb5f58e8d191f7c81637ad81284e4848afb4244 ]
    
    On 32-bit kernels, __flush_tlb_all() may have read the CR4 shadow before the
    initialization of CR4 shadow in cpu_init().
    
    Fix it by adding an explicit cr4_init_shadow() call into start_secondary()
    which is the first function called on non-boot SMP CPUs - ahead of the
    __flush_tlb_all() call.
    
    ( This is somewhat of a layering violation, but start_secondary() does
      CR4 bootstrap in the PCID case anyway. )

    Furthermore, Oleg noticed that the whole scheduler TASK_PARKED
    handling is buggered because the TASK_DEAD thing is done with
    preemption disabled, the current code can still complete early on
    preemption :/
    
    So basically revert that earlier fix and go with a variant of the
    alternative mentioned in the commit. Promote TASK_PARKED to special
    state to avoid the store-store issue on task->state leading to the
    WARN in kthread_unpark() -> __kthread_bind().
    
    But in addition, add wait_task_inactive() to kthread_park() to ensure
    the task really is PARKED when we return from kthread_park(). This
    avoids the whole kthread still gets migrated nonsense -- although it
    would be really good to get this done differently.

    sched/util_est: Fix util_est_dequeue() for throttled cfs_rq
    
    [ Upstream commit 3482d98bbc730758b63a5d1cf41d05ea17481412 ]
    
    When a cfs_rq is throttled, parent cfs_rq->nr_running is decreased and
    everything happens at cfs_rq level. Currently util_est stays unchanged
    in such case and it keeps accounting the utilization of throttled tasks.
    This can somewhat make sense as we don't dequeue tasks but only throttled
    cfs_rq.
    
    If a task of another group is enqueued/dequeued and root cfs_rq becomes
    idle during the dequeue, util_est will be cleared whereas it was
    accounting util_est of throttled tasks before. So the behavior of util_est
    is not always the same regarding throttled tasks and depends of side
    activity. Furthermore, util_est will not be updated when the cfs_rq is
    unthrottled as everything happens at cfs_rq level. Main results is that
    util_est will stay null whereas we now have running tasks. We have to wait
    for the next dequeue/enqueue of the previously throttled tasks to get an
    up to date util_est.
    
    Remove the assumption that cfs_rq's estimated utilization of a CPU is 0
    if there is no running task so the util_est of a task remains until the
    latter is dequeued even if its cfs_rq has been throttled.

    sched/fair: Fix bandwidth timer clock drift condition
    
    [ Upstream commit 512ac999d2755d2b7109e996a76b6fb8b888631d ]
    
    I noticed that cgroup task groups constantly get throttled even
    if they have low CPU usage, this causes some jitters on the response
    time to some of our business containers when enabling CPU quotas.
    
    It's very simple to reproduce:
    
      mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/test
      cd /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/test
      echo 100000 > cpu.cfs_quota_us
      echo $$ > tasks
    
    then repeat:
    
      cat cpu.stat | grep nr_throttled  # nr_throttled will increase steadily
    
    After some analysis, we found that cfs_rq::runtime_remaining will
    be cleared by expire_cfs_rq_runtime() due to two equal but stale
    "cfs_{b|q}->runtime_expires" after period timer is re-armed.
    
    The current condition to judge clock drift in expire_cfs_rq_runtime()
    is wrong, the two runtime_expires are actually the same when clock
    drift happens, so this condtion can never hit. The orginal design was
    correctly done by this commit:
    
      a9cf55b28610 ("sched: Expire invalid runtime")
    
    ... but was changed to be the current implementation due to its locking bug.
    
    This patch introduces another way, it adds a new field in both structures
    cfs_rq and cfs_bandwidth to record the expiration update sequence, and
    uses them to figure out if clock drift happens (true if they are equal).

    sched/nohz: Skip remote tick on idle task entirely
    
    [ Upstream commit d9c0ffcabd6aae7ff1e34e8078354c13bb9f1183 ]
    
    Some people have reported that the warning in sched_tick_remote()
    occasionally triggers, especially in favour of some RCU-Torture
    pressure:
    
            WARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 906 at kernel/sched/core.c:3138 sched_tick_remote+0xb6/0xc0

    This happens when the remote tick applies on an idle task. Usually the
    idle_cpu() check avoids that, but it is performed before we lock the
    runqueue and it is therefore racy. It was intended to be that way in
    order to prevent from useless runqueue locks since idle task tick
    callback is a no-op.
    
    Now if the racy check slips out of our hands and we end up remotely
    ticking an idle task, the empty task_tick_idle() is harmless. Still
    it won't pass the WARN_ON_ONCE() test that ensures rq_clock_task() is
    not too far from curr->se.exec_start because update_curr_idle() doesn't
    update the exec_start value like other scheduler policies. Hence the
    reported false positive.
    
    So let's have another check, while the rq is locked, to make sure we
    don't remote tick on an idle task. The lockless idle_cpu() still applies
    to avoid unecessary rq lock contention.

    ipvlan: call dev_change_flags when ipvlan mode is reset
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dc2d3996a8b221c20dd0900bdad45031a572530 ]
    
    After we change the ipvlan mode from l3 to l2, or vice versa, we only
    reset IFF_NOARP flag, but don't flush the ARP table cache, which will
    cause eth->h_dest to be equal to eth->h_source in ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2().
    Then the message will not come out of host.
    
    Here is the reproducer on local host:
    
    ip link set eth1 up
    ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev eth1
    ip link add link eth1 ipvlan1 type ipvlan mode l3
    
    ip netns add net1
    ip link set ipvlan1 netns net1
    ip netns exec net1 ip link set ipvlan1 up
    ip netns exec net1 ip addr add 192.168.2.1/24 dev ipvlan1
    
    ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.2
    ping 192.168.2.2 -c 2
    
    ip netns exec net1 ip link set ipvlan1 type ipvlan mode l2
    ping 192.168.2.2 -c 2
    
    Add the same configuration on remote host. After we set the mode to l2,
    we could find that the src/dst MAC addresses are the same on eth1:
    
    21:26:06.648565 00:b7:13:ad:d3:05 > 00:b7:13:ad:d3:05, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 58356, offset 0, flags [DF], proto ICMP (1), length 84)
        192.168.2.1 > 192.168.2.2: ICMP echo request, id 22686, seq 1, length 64
    
    Fix this by calling dev_change_flags(), which will call netdevice notifier
    with flag change info.
    
    v2:
    a) As pointed out by Wang Cong, check return value for dev_change_flags() when

    objtool: Support GCC 8 '-fnoreorder-functions'
    
    [ Upstream commit 08b393d01c88aff27347ed2b1b354eb4db2f1532 ]
    
    Since the following commit:
    
      cd77849a69cf ("objtool: Fix GCC 8 cold subfunction detection for aliased functions")
    
    ... if the kernel is built with EXTRA_CFLAGS='-fno-reorder-functions',
    objtool can get stuck in an infinite loop.
    
    That flag causes the new GCC 8 cold subfunctions to be placed in .text
    instead of .text.unlikely.  But it also has an unfortunate quirk: in the
    symbol table, the subfunction (e.g., nmi_panic.cold.7) is nested inside
    the parent (nmi_panic).
    
    That function overlap confuses objtool, and causes it to get into an
    infinite loop in next_insn_same_func().  Here's Allan's description of
    the loop:
    
      "Objtool iterates through the instructions in nmi_panic using
      next_insn_same_func. Once it reaches the end of nmi_panic at 0x534 it
      jumps to 0x528 as that's the start of nmi_panic.cold.7. However, since
      the instructions starting at 0x528 are still associated with nmi_panic
      objtool will get stuck in a loop, continually jumping back to 0x528
      after reaching 0x534."
    
    Fix it by shortening the length of the parent function so that the
    functions no longer overlap.

    m68k: fix "bad page state" oops on ColdFire boot
    
    [ Upstream commit ecd60532e060e45c63c57ecf1c8549b1d656d34d ]
    
    Booting a ColdFire m68k core with MMU enabled causes a "bad page state"
    oops since commit 1d40a5ea01d5 ("mm: mark pages in use for page tables"):
    
     BUG: Bad page state in process sh  pfn:01ce2
     page:004fefc8 count:0 mapcount:-1024 mapping:00000000 index:0x0

     Modules linked in:
     CPU: 0 PID: 22 Comm: sh Not tainted 4.17.0-07461-g1d40a5ea01d5 #13
    
    Fix by calling pgtable_page_dtor() in our __pte_free_tlb() code path,
    so that the PG_table flag is cleared before we free the pte page.
    
    Note that I had to change the type of pte_free() to be static from
    extern. Otherwise you get a lot of warnings like this:
    
    ./arch/m68k/include/asm/mcf_pgalloc.h:80:2: warning: ‘pgtable_page_dtor’ is static but used in inline function ‘pte_free’ which is not static
      pgtable_page_dtor(page);
      ^
    
    And making it static is consistent with our use of this in the other
    m68k pgalloc definitions of pte_free().

    crypto: arm/speck - fix building in Thumb2 mode
    
    [ Upstream commit a068b94d74ddb7776ca707b6d39d1ac0d2d057e6 ]
    
    Building the kernel with CONFIG_THUMB2_KERNEL=y and
    CONFIG_CRYPTO_SPECK_NEON set fails with the following errors:
    
        arch/arm/crypto/speck-neon-core.S: Assembler messages:

        arch/arm/crypto/speck-neon-core.S:431: Error: r13 not allowed here -- `bic sp,#0xf'
    
    The problem is that the 'bic' instruction can't operate on the 'sp'
    register in Thumb2 mode.  Fix it by using a temporary register.  This
    isn't in the main loop, so the performance difference is negligible.
    This also matches what aes-neonbs-core.S does.

    openrisc: entry: Fix delay slot exception detection
    
    [ Upstream commit ae15a41a641449f536578b0d9ec0e4ade130deb5 ]
    
    Originally in patch e6d20c55a4 ("openrisc: entry: Fix delay slot
    detection") I fixed delay slot detection, but only for QEMU.  We missed
    that hardware delay slot detection using delay slot exception flag (DSX)
    was still broken.  This was because QEMU set the DSX flag in both
    pre-exception supervision register (ESR) and supervision register (SR)
    register, but on real hardware the DSX flag is only set on the SR
    register during exceptions.
    
    Fix this by carrying the DSX flag into the SR register during exception.
    We also update the DSX flag read locations to read the value from the SR
    register not the pt_regs SR register which represents ESR.  The ESR
    should never have the DSX flag set.
    
    In the process I updated/removed a few comments to match the current
    state.  Including removing a comment saying that the DSX detection logic
    was inefficient and needed to be rewritten.
    
    I have tested this on QEMU with a patch ensuring it matches the hardware
    specification.

    Commit 546eb0317cfa "libnvdimm, pmem: Do not flush power-fail protected CPU caches"
    fixed the write_cache detection to correctly show the lack of a write
    cache based on the platform capabilities described in the ACPI NFIT. The
    nfit_test unit tests expected a write cache to be present, so change the
    nfit test namespaces to only advertise a persistence domain limited to
    the memory controller. This allows the kernel to show a write_cache
    attribute, and the test behaviour remains unchanged.

    [ Upstream commit 484c016d9392786ce5c74017c206c706f29f823d ]
    
    Driver performs the internal reload when it receives tx-timeout event from
    the OS. Internal reload might fail in some scenarios e.g., fatal HW issues.
    In such cases OS still see the link, which would result in undesirable
    functionalities such as re-generation of tx-timeouts.
    The patch addresses this issue by indicating the link-down to OS when
    tx-timeout is detected, and keeping the link in down state till the
    internal reload is successful.
    
    Please consider applying it to 'net' branch.

    Some devices have different queue limits depending on the type of IO. A
    classic case is SATA NCQ, where some commands can queue, but others
    cannot. If we have NCQ commands inflight and encounter a non-queueable
    command, the driver returns busy. Currently we attempt to dispatch more
    from the scheduler, if we were able to queue some commands. But for the
    case where we ended up stopping due to BUSY, we should not attempt to
    retrieve more from the scheduler. If we do, we can get into a situation
    where we attempt to queue a non-queueable command, get BUSY, then
    successfully retrieve more commands from that scheduler and queue those.
    This can repeat forever, starving the non-queuable command indefinitely.
    
    Fix this by NOT attempting to pull more commands from the scheduler, if
    we get a BUSY return. This should also be more optimal in terms of
    letting requests stay in the scheduler for as long as possible, if we
    get a BUSY due to the regular out-of-tags condition.

    nl80211: relax ht operation checks for mesh
    
    [ Upstream commit 188f60ab8e787fcbb5ac9d64ede23a0070231f09 ]
    
    Commit 9757235f451c, "nl80211: correct checks for
    NL80211_MESHCONF_HT_OPMODE value") relaxed the range for the HT
    operation field in meshconf, while also adding checks requiring
    the non-greenfield and non-ht-sta bits to be set in certain
    circumstances.  The latter bit is actually reserved for mesh BSSes
    according to Table 9-168 in 802.11-2016, so in fact it should not
    be set.
    
    wpa_supplicant sets these bits because the mesh and AP code share
    the same implementation, but authsae does not.  As a result, some
    meshconf updates from authsae which set only the NONHT_MIXED
    protection bits were being rejected.
    
    In order to avoid breaking userspace by changing the rules again,
    simply accept the values with or without the bits set, and mask
    off the reserved bit to match the spec.
    
    While in here, update the 802.11-2012 reference to 802.11-2016.

    md/raid10: fix that replacement cannot complete recovery after reassemble
    
    [ Upstream commit bda3153998f3eb2cafa4a6311971143628eacdbc ]
    
    During assemble, the spare marked for replacement is not checked.
    conf->fullsync cannot be updated to be 1. As a result, recovery will
    treat it as a clean array. All recovering sectors are skipped. Original
    device is replaced with the not-recovered spare.
    
    mdadm -C /dev/md0 -l10 -n4 -pn2 /dev/loop[0123]
    mdadm /dev/md0 -a /dev/loop4
    mdadm /dev/md0 --replace /dev/loop0
    mdadm -S /dev/md0 # stop array during recovery
    
    mdadm -A /dev/md0 /dev/loop[01234]
    
    After reassemble, you can see recovery go on, but it completes
    immediately. In fact, recovery is not actually processed.
    
    To solve this problem, we just add the missing logics for replacment
    spares. (In raid1.c or raid5.c, they have already been checked.)

    ath10k: update the phymode along with bandwidth change request
    
    [ Upstream commit 9191fc2a431bade3dedc9ad17759495a9f82f41b ]
    
    In the case of Station connects to AP with narrower bandwidth at beginning.
    And later the AP changes the bandwidth to winder bandwidth, the AP will
    beacon with wider bandwidth IE, eg VHT20->VHT40->VHT80 or VHT40->VHT80.
    
    Since the supported BANDWIDTH will be limited by the PHYMODE, so while
    Station receives the bandwidth change request, it will also need to
    reconfigure the PHYMODE setting to firmware instead of just configuring
    the BANDWIDTH info, otherwise it'll trigger a firmware crash with
    non-support bandwidth.
    
    The issue was observed in WLAN.RM.4.4.1-00051-QCARMSWP-1, QCA6174 with
    below scenario:
    
    AP xxx changed bandwidth, new config is 5200 MHz, width 2 (5190/0 MHz)
    disconnect from AP xxx for new auth to yyy
    RX ReassocResp from xxx (capab=0x1111 status=0 aid=102)
    associated
    
    ....
    
    AP xxx changed bandwidth, new config is 5200 MHz, width 2 (5190/0 MHz)
    AP xxx changed bandwidth, new config is 5200 MHz, width 3 (5210/0 MHz)

    meson-gxl-mali.dtsi is only used on GXL SoCs. Thus it should use the GXL
    specific compatible string instead of the GXBB one.
    For now this is purely cosmetic since the (out-of-tree) lima driver for
    this GPU currently uses the "arm,mali-450" match instead of the SoC
    specific one. However, update the .dts to match the documentation since
    this driver behavior might change in the future.

    also break during the boot sequence.

    arm64: Avoid flush_icache_range() in alternatives patching code
    
    [ Upstream commit 429388682dc266e7a693f9c27e3aabd341d55343 ]
    
    The implementation of flush_icache_range() includes instruction sequences
    which are themselves patched at runtime, so it is not safe to call from
    the patching framework.
    
    This patch reworks the alternatives cache-flushing code so that it rolls
    its own internal D-cache maintenance using DC CIVAC before invalidating
    the entire I-cache after all alternatives have been applied at boot.
    Modules don't cause any issues, since flush_icache_range() is safe to
    call by the time they are loaded.

    ARM: dts: da850: Fix interrups property for gpio
    
    [ Upstream commit 3eb1b955cd7ed1e621ace856710006c2a8a7f231 ]
    
    The intc #interrupt-cells is equal to 1. Currently gpio
    node has 2 cells per IRQ which is wrong. Remove the additional
    cell for each of the interrupts.

    selftests/x86/sigreturn/64: Fix spurious failures on AMD CPUs
    
    [ Upstream commit ec348020566009d3da9b99f07c05814d13969c78 ]
    
    When I wrote the sigreturn test, I didn't realize that AMD's busted
    IRET behavior was different from Intel's busted IRET behavior:
    
    On AMD CPUs, the CPU leaks the high 32 bits of the kernel stack pointer
    to certain userspace contexts.  Gee, thanks.  There's very little
    the kernel can do about it.  Modify the test so it passes.

    rds: clean up loopback rds_connections on netns deletion
    
    [ Upstream commit c809195f5523dd4d09403bbb1c9732d548aa0d1e ]
    
    The RDS core module creates rds_connections based on callbacks
    from rds_loop_transport when sending/receiving packets to local
    addresses.
    
    These connections will need to be cleaned up when they are
    created from a netns that is not init_net, and that netns is deleted.
    
    Add the changes aligned with the changes from
    commit ebeeb1ad9b8a ("rds: tcp: use rds_destroy_pending() to synchronize
    netns/module teardown and rds connection/workq management") for
    rds_loop_transport

    net/mlx5: E-Switch, Disallow vlan/spoofcheck setup if not being esw manager
    
    [ Upstream commit a8d70a054a718b63058b3d3ac58b6181815e4289 ]
    
    In smartnic env, if the host (PF) driver is not an e-switch manager, we
    are not allowed to apply eswitch ports setups such as vlan (VST),
    spoof-checks, min/max rate or state.
    
    Make sure we are eswitch manager when coming to issue these callbacks
    and err otherwise.
    
    Also fix the definition of ESW_ALLOWED to rely on eswitch_manager
    capability and on the vport_group_manger.
    
    Operations on the VF nic vport context, such as setting a mac or reading
    the vport counters are allowed to the PF in this scheme.
    
    The modify nic vport guid code was modified to omit checking the
    nic_vport_node_guid_modify eswitch capability.
    The reason for doing so is that modifying node guid requires vport group
    manager capability, and there's no need to check further capabilities.
    
    1. set_vf_vlan     - disallowed
    2. set_vf_spoofchk - disallowed
    3. set_vf_mac      - allowed
    4. get_vf_config   - allowed
    5. set_vf_trust    - disallowed

    perf bench: Fix numa report output code
    
    [ Upstream commit 983107072be1a39cbde67d45cb0059138190e015 ]
    
    Currently we can hit following assert when running numa bench:
    
      $ perf bench numa mem -p 3 -t 1 -P 512 -s 100 -zZ0cm --thp 1
      perf: bench/numa.c:1577: __bench_numa: Assertion `!(!(((wait_stat) & 0x7f) == 0))' failed.
    
    The assertion is correct, because we hit the SIGFPE in following line:
    
      Thread 2.2 "thread 0/0" received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.
      [Switching to Thread 0x7fffd28c6700 (LWP 11750)]
      0x000.. in worker_thread (__tdata=0x7.. ) at bench/numa.c:1257
      1257 td->speed_gbs = bytes_done / (td->runtime_ns / NSEC_PER_SEC) / 1e9;
    
    We don't check if the runtime is actually bigger than 1 second,
    and thus this might end up with zero division within FPU.
    
    Adding the check to prevent this.

    perf tests: Add event parsing error handling to parse events test
    
    [ Upstream commit 933ccf2002aaef1037cb676622a694f5390c3d59 ]
    
    Add missing error handling for parse_events calls in test_event function
    that led to following segfault on s390:
    
      running test 52 'intel_pt//u'
      perf: Segmentation fault
      ...
      /lib64/libc.so.6(vasprintf+0xe6) [0x3fffca3f106]
      /lib64/libc.so.6(asprintf+0x46) [0x3fffca1aa96]

      ./perf(parse_events+0x98) [0x801341c0]
      ./perf(test__parse_events+0x48) [0x800cd140]
      ./perf(cmd_test+0x26a) [0x800bd44a]
      test child interrupted
    
    Adding the struct parse_events_error argument to parse_events call. Also
    adding parse_events_print_error to get more details on the parsing
    failures, like:
    
      # perf test 6 -v
      running test 52 'intel_pt//u'failed to parse event 'intel_pt//u', err 1, str 'Cannot find PMU `intel_pt'. Missing kernel support?'
      event syntax error: 'intel_pt//u'
                           \___ Cannot find PMU `intel_pt'. Missing kernel support?
    
    Committer note:
    
    Use named initializers in the struct parse_events_error variable to
    avoid breaking the build on centos5, 6 and others with a similar gcc:
    
      cc1: warnings being treated as errors
      tests/parse-events.c: In function 'test_event':
      tests/parse-events.c:1696: error: missing initializer

    perf report powerpc: Fix crash if callchain is empty
    
    [ Upstream commit 143c99f6ac6812d23254e80844d6e34be897d3e1 ]
    
    For some cases, the callchain provided by the kernel may be empty. So,
    the callchain ip filtering code will cause a crash if we do not check
    whether the struct ip_callchain pointer is NULL before accessing any
    members.
    
    This can be observed on a powerpc64le system running Fedora 27 as shown
    below.

    perf test session topology: Fix test on s390
    
    [ Upstream commit b930e62ecd362843002bdf84c2940439822af321 ]
    
    On s390 this test case fails because the socket identifiction numbers
    assigned to the CPU are higher than the CPU identification numbers.
    
    F/ix this by adding the platform architecture into the perf data header
    flag information. This helps identifiing the test platform and handles
    s390 specifics in process_cpu_topology().

    [ Upstream commit 01766229533f9bdb1144a41b4345c8c7286da7b4 ]
    
    On s390 the socket identifier assigned to a CPU identifier is random and
    (depending on the configuration of the LPAR) may be higher than the CPU
    identifier. This is currently not supported.
    
    Fix this by allowing arbitrary socket identifiers being assigned to
    CPU id.

    kconfig: fix line numbers for if-entries in menu tree
    
    [ Upstream commit b2d00d7c61c84edd150310af3f556f8a3c6e2e67 ]
    
    The line numers for if-entries in the menu tree are off by one or more
    lines which is confusing when debugging for correctness of unrelated changes.
    
    According to the git log, commit a02f0570ae201c49 (kconfig: improve
    error handling in the parser) was the last one that changed that part
    of the parser and replaced
    
            "if_entry: T_IF expr T_EOL"
    by
            "if_entry: T_IF expr nl"
    
    but the commit message does not state why this has been done.
    
    When reverting that part of the commit, only the line numers are
    corrected (checked with cdebug = DEBUG_PARSE in zconf.y), otherwise
    the menu tree remains unchanged (checked with zconfdump() enabled in
    conf.c).
    
    An example for the corrected line numbers:
    
    drivers/soc/Kconfig:15:source drivers/soc/tegra/Kconfig
    drivers/soc/tegra/Kconfig:4:if
    drivers/soc/tegra/Kconfig:6:if

    drivers/soc/Kconfig:15:source drivers/soc/tegra/Kconfig

    nfp: bpf: don't stop offload if replace failed
    
    [ Upstream commit 68d676a089625daed9d61df56ac63b5cd7189efe ]
    
    Stopping offload completely if replace of program failed dates
    back to days of transparent offload.  Back then we wanted to
    silently fall back to the in-driver processing.  Today we mark
    programs for offload when they are loaded into the kernel, so
    the transparent offload is no longer a reality.
    
    Flags check in the driver will only allow replace of a driver
    program with another driver program or an offload program with
    another offload program.
    
    When driver program is replaced stopping offload is a no-op,
    because driver program isn't offloaded.  When replacing
    offloaded program if the offload fails the entire operation
    will fail all the way back to user space and we should continue
    using the old program.  IOW when replacing a driver program
    stopping offload is unnecessary and when replacing offloaded
    program - it's a bug, old program should continue to run.
    
    In practice this bug would mean that if offload operation was to
    fail (either due to FW communication error, kernel OOM or new
    program being offloaded but for a different netdev) driver
    would continue reporting that previous XDP program is offloaded
    but in fact no program will be loaded in hardware.  The failure
    is fairly unlikely (found by inspection, when working on the code)
    but it's unpleasant.
    
    Backport note: even though the bug was introduced in commit
    cafa92ac2553 ("nfp: bpf: add support for XDP_FLAGS_HW_MODE"),
    this fix depends on commit 441a33031fe5 ("net: xdp: don't allow
    device-bound programs in driver mode"), so this fix is sufficient
    only in v4.15 or newer.  Kernels v4.13.x and v4.14.x do need to
    stop offload if it was transparent/opportunistic, i.e. if
    XDP_FLAGS_HW_MODE was not set on running program.

    fix it so that fuzzers won't hit this again later.

    ipmi: kcs_bmc: fix IRQ exception if the channel is not open
    
    [ Upstream commit dc0f0a026d33819bb82d5c26ab2fca838e2004be ]
    
    When kcs_bmc_handle_event calls kcs_force_abort function to handle the
    not open (no user running) KCS channel transaction, the returned status
    value -ENODEV causes the low level IRQ handler indicating that the irq
    was not for him by returning IRQ_NONE. After some time, this IRQ will
    be treated to be spurious one, and the exception dump happens.

    It needs to change the returned status from -ENODEV to 0. The -ENODEV
    was originally used to tell the low level IRQ handler that no user was
    running, but not consider the IRQ handling desgin.
    
    And multiple KCS channels share one IRQ handler, it needs to check the
    IBF flag before doing force abort. If the IBF is set, after handling,
    return 0 to low level IRQ handler to indicate that the IRQ is handled.

    [ Upstream commit 13399ff25f179811ce9c1df1523eb39f9e4a4772 ]
    
    According to IIO ABI relative humidity reading should be
    returned in milli percent.
    
    This patch addresses that by applying proper scaling and
    returning integer instead of fractional format type specifier.
    
    Note that the fixes tag is before the driver was heavily refactored
    to introduce spi support, so the patch won't apply that far back.

    When a (broken) node wrongly sends multicast TT entries with a ROAM
    flag then this causes any receiving node to drop all entries for the
    same multicast MAC address announced by other nodes, leading to
    packet loss.
    
    Fix this DoS vector by only storing TT sync flags. For multicast TT
    non-sync'ing flag bits like ROAM are unused so far anyway.

    [ Upstream commit 4a519b83da16927fb98fd32b0f598e639d1f1859 ]
    
    Since commit 54e22f265e87 ("batman-adv: fix TT sync flag inconsistencies")
    TT sync flags and TT non-sync'd flags are supposed to be stored
    separately.
    
    The previous patch missed to apply this separation on a TT entry with
    only a single TT orig entry.
    
    This is a minor fix because with only a single TT orig entry the DDoS
    issue the former patch solves does not apply.

    batman-adv: Fix debugfs path for renamed softif
    
    [ Upstream commit 6da7be7d24b2921f8215473ba7552796dff05fe1 ]
    
    batman-adv is creating special debugfs directories in the init
    net_namespace for each created soft-interface (batadv net_device). But it
    is possible to rename a net_device to a completely different name then the
    original one.
    
    It can therefore happen that a user registers a new batadv net_device with
    the name "bat0". batman-adv is then also adding a new directory under
    $debugfs/batman-adv/ with the name "wlan0".
    
    The user then decides to rename this device to "bat1" and registers a
    different batadv device with the name "bat0". batman-adv will then try to
    create a directory with the name "bat0" under $debugfs/batman-adv/ again.
    But there already exists one with this name under this path and thus this
    fails. batman-adv will detect a problem and rollback the registering of
    this device.
    
    batman-adv must therefore take care of renaming the debugfs directories for
    soft-interfaces whenever it detects such a net_device rename.

    batman-adv is creating special debugfs directories in the init
    net_namespace for each valid hard-interface (net_device). But it is
    possible to rename a net_device to a completely different name then the
    original one.
    
    It can therefore happen that a user registers a new net_device which gets
    the name "wlan0" assigned by default. batman-adv is also adding a new
    directory under $debugfs/batman-adv/ with the name "wlan0".
    
    The user then decides to rename this device to "wl_pri" and registers a
    different device. The kernel may now decide to use the name "wlan0" again
    for this new device. batman-adv will detect it as a valid net_device and
    tries to create a directory with the name "wlan0" under
    $debugfs/batman-adv/. But there already exists one with this name under
    this path and thus this fails. batman-adv will detect a problem and

    batman-adv: Fix bat_ogm_iv best gw refcnt after netlink dump
    
    [ Upstream commit b5685d2687d6612adf5eac519eb7008f74dfd1ec ]
    
    A reference for the best gateway is taken when the list of gateways in the
    mesh is sent via netlink. This is necessary to check whether the currently
    dumped entry is the currently selected gateway or not. This information is
    then transferred as flag BATADV_ATTR_FLAG_BEST.

    Enabling LPIs was made a lot stricter recently, by checking that they are
    disabled before enabling them. By doing so, the CPU hotplug case was missed
    altogether, which leaves LPIs enabled on hotplug off (expecting the CPU to
    eventually come back), and won't write a different value anyway on hotplug
    on.
    
    So skip that check if that particular case is detected

    locking/lockdep: Do not record IRQ state within lockdep code
    
    [ Upstream commit fcc784be837714a9173b372ff9fb9b514590dad9 ]
    
    While debugging where things were going wrong with mapping
    enabling/disabling interrupts with the lockdep state and actual real
    enabling and disabling interrupts, I had to silent the IRQ
    disabling/enabling in debug_check_no_locks_freed() because it was
    always showing up as it was called before the splat was.
    
    Use raw_local_irq_save/restore() for not only debug_check_no_locks_freed()
    but for all internal lockdep functions, as they hide useful information
    about where interrupts were used incorrectly last.

    clk: sunxi-ng: replace lib-y with obj-y
    
    [ Upstream commit 12f8c553a503d98b519cca650b188bf51ebdbdbf ]
    
    We had commit 06e226c7fb23 ("clk: sunxi-ng: Move all clock types to a
    library") and commit 799c43415442 ("kbuild: thin archives make default
    for all archs") in the same development cycle, from different trees.
    
    With migration to the thin archive, the entire drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/lib.a
    is linked to the vmlinux.  This does not break build, but we do not get
    any size saving.
    
    However, we do not need to go back to the individual Kconfig options.
    The default configuration pulls in all (or most) of the CCU parts anyway.
    Also, once we enable CONFIG_LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION, we can simply
    list all files with obj-y, and the linker will drop all unused functions
    by itself.
    
    After the long discussion [1], people there agreed to fix this, but
    nobody sent a patch after all.  I am doing it now.
    
    I lifted up CONFIG_SUNXI_CCU to drivers/clk/Makefile because everything
    in drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ depends on SUNXI_CCU.

                                     -> queue remove_work

        -> blk_cleanup_queue
          -> blk_freeze_queue
    
    Finally, the request_queue is quiesced state when wait freeze,
    we will get io hang here. To fix it, move the nvme_kill_queues
    from nvme_remove_dead_ctrl_work to nvme_remove_dead_ctrl.

    KVM: arm/arm64: Drop resource size check for GICV window
    
    [ Upstream commit ba56bc3a0786992755e6804fbcbdc60ef6cfc24c ]
    
    When booting a 64 KB pages kernel on a ACPI GICv3 system that
    implements support for v2 emulation, the following warning is
    produced
    
      GICV size 0x2000 not a multiple of page size 0x10000
    
    and support for v2 emulation is disabled, preventing GICv2 VMs
    from being able to run on such hosts.
    
    The reason is that vgic_v3_probe() performs a sanity check on the
    size of the window (it should be a multiple of the page size),
    while the ACPI MADT parsing code hardcodes the size of the window
    to 8 KB. This makes sense, considering that ACPI does not bother
    to describe the size in the first place, under the assumption that
    platforms implementing ACPI will follow the architecture and not
    put anything else in the same 64 KB window.
    
    So let's just drop the sanity check altogether, and assume that
    the window is at least 64 KB in size.

    [ Upstream commit 2f24ef7413a4d91657ef04e77c27ce0b313e6c95 ]
    
    machine_desc->init_per_cpu() hook is supposed to be per cpu
    initialization and would seem to apply  equally to UP and/or SMP.
    Infact the comment in header file seems to suggest it works for
    UP too, which was not the case and this patch.
    
    This enables !CONFIG_SMP build for platforms such as hsdk.

    nvme-rdma: Fix command completion race at error recovery
    
    [ Upstream commit c947657b15379505a9bba36a02005882b66abe57 ]
    
    The race is between completing the request at error recovery work and
    rdma completions.  If we cancel the request before getting the good
    rdma completion we get a NULL deref of the request MR at
    nvme_rdma_process_nvme_rsp().
    
    When Canceling the request we return its mr to the mr pool (set mr to
    NULL) and also unmap its data.  Canceling the requests while the rdma
    queues are active is not safe.  Because rdma queues are active and we
    get good rdma completions that can use the mr pointer which may be NULL.
    Completing the request too soon may lead also to performing DMA to/from
    user buffers which might have been already unmapped.
    
    The commit fixes the race by draining the QP before starting the abort
    commands mechanism.

    [ Upstream commit 3d0641015bf73aaa1cb54c936674959e7805070f ]
    
    Failures after nvme_init_ctrl will defer resource cleanups to .free_ctrl
    when the reference is released, hence we should not free the controller
    queues for these failures.
    
    Fix that by moving controller queues allocation before controller
    initialization and correctly freeing them for failures before
    initialization and skip them for failures after initialization.

    [ Upstream commit bc8a2d9bcbf1ca548b1deb315d14e1da81945bea ]
    
    The Stratix10 platform has an additional reset line, OCP(Open Core Protocol),
    that also needs to get deasserted for the stmmac ethernet controller to work.
    Thus we need to update the Kconfig to include ARCH_STRATIX10 in order to build
    dwmac-socfpga.
    
    Also, remove the redundant check for the reset controller pointer. The
    reset driver already checks for the pointer and returns 0 if the pointer
    is NULL.

    drops such packets.

    [ Upstream commit dd65a941f6ba473a5cb9d013d57fa43b48450a04 ]
    
    dma_alloc_*() buffers might be exposed to userspace via mmap() call, so
    they should be cleared on allocation. In case of IOMMU-based dma-mapping
    implementation such buffer clearing was missing in the code path for
    DMA_ATTR_FORCE_CONTIGUOUS flag handling, because dma_alloc_from_contiguous()
    doesn't honor __GFP_ZERO flag. This patch fixes this issue. For more
    information on clearing buffers allocated by dma_alloc_* functions,
    see commit 6829e274a623 ("arm64: dma-mapping: always clear allocated

    powerpc: smp_send_stop do not offline stopped CPUs
    
    [ Upstream commit de6e5d38417e6cdb005843db420a2974993d36ff ]
    
    Marking CPUs stopped by smp_send_stop as offline can cause warnings
    due to cross-CPU wakeups. This trace was noticed on a busy system
    running a sysrq+c crash test, after the injected crash:

    This happens because firstly the CPU is not really offline in the
    usual sense, processes and interrupts have not been migrated away.
    Secondly smp_send_stop does not happen atomically on all CPUs, so
    one CPU can have marked itself offline, while another CPU is still
    running processes or interrupts which can affect the first CPU.
    
    Fix this by just not marking the CPU as offline. It's more like
    frozen in time, so offline does not really reflect its state properly
    anyway. There should be nothing in the crash/panic path that walks
    online CPUs and synchronously waits for them, so this change should
    not introduce new hangs.

    usb: dwc2: fix isoc split in transfer with no data
    
    [ Upstream commit 70c3c8cb83856758025c2a211dd022bc0478922a ]
    
    If isoc split in transfer with no data (the length of DATA0
    packet is zero), we can't simply return immediately. Because
    the DATA0 can be the first transaction or the second transaction
    for the isoc split in transaction. If the DATA0 packet with no
    data is in the first transaction, we can return immediately.
    But if the DATA0 packet with no data is in the second transaction
    of isoc split in transaction sequence, we need to increase the
    qtd->isoc_frame_index and giveback urb to device driver if needed,
    otherwise, the MDATA packet will be lost.
    
    A typical test case is that connect the dwc2 controller with an
    usb hs Hub (GL852G-12), and plug an usb fs audio device (Plantronics
    headset) into the downstream port of Hub. Then use the usb mic
    to record, we can find noise when playback.
    
    In the case, the isoc split in transaction sequence like this:
    
    - SSPLIT IN transaction
    - CSPLIT IN transaction
      - MDATA packet (176 bytes)
    - CSPLIT IN transaction
      - DATA0 packet (0 byte)
    
    This patch use both the length of DATA0 and qtd->isoc_split_offset
    to check if the DATA0 is in the second transaction.

    usb: dwc2: alloc dma aligned buffer for isoc split in
    
    [ Upstream commit af424a410749ed7e0c2bffd3cedbc7c274d0ff6f ]
    
    The commit 3bc04e28a030 ("usb: dwc2: host: Get aligned DMA in
    a more supported way") rips out a lot of code to simply the
    allocation of aligned DMA. However, it also introduces a new
    issue when use isoc split in transfer.
    
    In my test case, I connect the dwc2 controller with an usb hs
    Hub (GL852G-12), and plug an usb fs audio device (Plantronics
    headset) into the downstream port of Hub. Then use the usb mic
    to record, we can find noise when playback.
    
    It's because that the usb Hub uses an MDATA for the first
    transaction and a DATA0 for the second transaction for the isoc
    split in transaction. An typical isoc split in transaction sequence
    like this:
    
    - SSPLIT IN transaction
    - CSPLIT IN transaction
      - MDATA packet
    - CSPLIT IN transaction
      - DATA0 packet
    
    The DMA address of MDATA (urb->dma) is always DWORD-aligned, but
    the DMA address of DATA0 (urb->dma + qtd->isoc_split_offset) may
    not be DWORD-aligned, it depends on the qtd->isoc_split_offset (the
    length of MDATA). In my test case, the length of MDATA is usually
    unaligned, this cause DATA0 packet transmission error.
    
    This patch use kmem_cache to allocate aligned DMA buf for isoc
    split in transaction. Note that according to usb 2.0 spec, the
    maximum data payload size is 1023 bytes for each fs isoc ep,
    and the maximum allowable interrupt data payload size is 64 bytes
    or less for fs interrupt ep. So we set the size of object to be
    1024 bytes in the kmem cache.

    dmaengine: ti: omap-dma: Fix OMAP1510 incorrect residue_granularity
    
    [ Upstream commit c9bd0946da243a8eb86b44ff613e2c813f9b683b ]
    
    Commit 0198d7bb8a0c ("ASoC: omap-mcbsp: Convert to use the sdma-pcm
    instead of omap-pcm") resulted in broken audio playback on OMAP1510
    (discovered on Amstrad Delta).
    
    When running on OMAP1510, omap-pcm used to obtain DMA offset from
    snd_dmaengine_pcm_pointer_no_residue() based on DMA interrupt triggered
    software calculations instead of snd_dmaengine_pcm_pointer() which
    depended on residue value calculated from omap_dma_get_src_pos().
    Similar code path is still available in now used
    sound/soc/soc-generic-dmaengine-pcm.c but it is not triggered.
    
    It was verified already before that omap_get_dma_src_pos() from
    arch/arm/plat-omap/dma.c didn't work correctly for OMAP1510 - see
    commit 1bdd7419910c ("ASoC: OMAP: fix OMAP1510 broken PCM pointer
    callback") for details.  Apparently the same applies to its successor,
    omap_dma_get_src_pos() from drivers/dma/ti/omap-dma.c.
    
    On the other hand, snd_dmaengine_pcm_pointer_no_residue() is described
    as depreciated and discouraged for use in new drivers because of its
    unreliable accuracy.  However, it seems the only working option for
    OPAM1510 now, as long as a software calculated residue is not
    implemented as OMAP1510 fallback in omap-dma.
    
    Using snd_dmaengine_pcm_pointer_no_residue() code path instead of
    snd_dmaengine_pcm_pointer() in sound/soc/soc-generic-dmaengine-pcm.c
    can be triggered in two ways:
    - by passing pcm->flags |= SND_DMAENGINE_PCM_FLAG_NO_RESIDUE from
      sound/soc/omap/sdma-pcm.c,
    - by passing dma_caps.residue_granularity =
      DMA_RESIDUE_GRANULARITY_DESCRIPTOR from DMA engine.
    
    Let's do the latter.

    [ Upstream commit 89610dc2c235e7b02bb9fba0ce247e12d4dde7cd ]
    
    In the situation that DE and SE aren’t shared the same interrupt number,
    the Global SE interrupts mask bit MASK_IRQ_EN in MASKIRQ must be set, or
    else other mask bits will not work and no SE interrupt will occur. This
    patch enables MASK_IRQ_EN for SE to fix this problem.

    drm/arm/malidp: Ensure that the crtcs are shutdown before removing any encoder/connector
    
    [ Upstream commit 109c4d18e57445afcaf728b8716a69375a3daab2 ]
    
    One needs to ensure that the crtcs are shutdown so that the
    drm_crtc_state->connector_mask reflects that no connectors
    are currently active. Further, it reduces the reference
    count for each connector. This ensures that the connectors
    and encoders can be cleanly removed either when _unbind
    is called for the corresponding drivers or by
    drm_mode_config_cleanup().
    We need drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() to be called before
    component_unbind_all() otherwise the connectors attached to the
    component device will have the wrong reference count value and will not
    be cleanly removed.

    The helper module would be unloaded after nf_conntrack_helper_unregister,
    so it may cause a possible panic caused by race.
    
    nf_ct_iterate_destroy(unhelp, me) reset the helper of conntrack as NULL,
    but maybe someone has gotten the helper pointer during this period. Then
    it would panic, when it accesses the helper and the module was unloaded.
    
    Take an example as following:
    CPU0                                                   CPU1
    ctnetlink_dump_helpinfo
    helper = rcu_dereference(help->helper);
                                                           unhelp
                                                           set helper as NULL
                                                           unload helper module
    helper->to_nlattr(skb, ct);
    
    As above, the cpu0 tries to access the helper and its module is unloaded,
    then the panic happens.

    netfilter: ipv6: nf_defrag: reduce struct net memory waste
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ce7bc036ae4cfe3393232c86e9e1fea2153c237 ]
    
    It is a waste of memory to use a full "struct netns_sysctl_ipv6"
    while only one pointer is really used, considering netns_sysctl_ipv6
    keeps growing.
    
    Also, since "struct netns_frags" has cache line alignment,
    it is better to move the frags_hdr pointer outside, otherwise
    we spend a full cache line for this pointer.
    
    This saves 192 bytes of memory per netns.

    ACPI / EC: Use ec_no_wakeup on Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th
    
    [ Upstream commit 8195a655e5ce09550aff81b2573d9b015d520cb9 ]
    
    On this system EC interrupt triggers constantly kicking devices out of
    low power states and thus blocking power management. The system also has
    a PCIe root port hosting Alpine Ridge Thunderbolt controller and it
    never gets a chance to go to D3cold because of this.
    
    Since the power button works the same regardless if EC interrupt is
    enabled or not during s2idle, add a quirk for this machine that sets
    ec_no_wakeup=true preventing spurious wakeups.

    smb3: increase initial number of credits requested to allow write
    
    [ Upstream commit d409014e4feeab486fb36b350abfc4c94de8be37 ]
    
    Compared to other clients the Linux smb3 client ramps up
    credits very slowly, taking more than 128 operations before a
    maximum size write could be sent (since the number of credits
    requested is only 2 per small operation, causing the credit
    limit to grow very slowly).
    
    This lack of credits initially would impact large i/o performance,
    when large i/o is tried early before enough credits are built up.

    [ Upstream commit 47cf52a246e526e2092d60ac01c54af9bd45dcc9 ]
    
    Modern distroes increasingly make use of BPF programs.  Default
    Ubuntu 18.04 installation boots with a number of cgroup_skb
    programs loaded.
    
    test_offloads.py tries to check if programs and maps are not
    leaked on error paths by confirming the list of programs on the
    system is empty between tests.
    
    Since we can no longer expect the system to have no BPF objects
    at boot try to remember the programs and maps present at the start,
    and skip those when scanning the system.

    ARC: Explicitly add -mmedium-calls to CFLAGS
    
    [ Upstream commit 74c11e300c103af47db5b658fdcf28002421e250 ]
    
    GCC built for arc*-*-linux has "-mmedium-calls" implicitly enabled by default
    thus we don't see any problems during Linux kernel compilation.
    ----------------------------->8------------------------
    arc-linux-gcc -mcpu=arc700 -Q --help=target | grep calls
      -mlong-calls                          [disabled]
      -mmedium-calls                        [enabled]
    ----------------------------->8------------------------
    
    But if we try to use so-called Elf32 toolchain with GCC configured for
    arc*-*-elf* then we'd see the following failure:
    ----------------------------->8------------------------
    init/do_mounts.o: In function 'init_rootfs':
    do_mounts.c:(.init.text+0x108): relocation truncated to fit: R_ARC_S21W_PCREL
    against symbol 'unregister_filesystem' defined in .text section in fs/filesystems.o
    
    arc-elf32-ld: final link failed: Symbol needs debug section which does not exist
    make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
    ----------------------------->8------------------------
    
    That happens because neither "-mmedium-calls" nor "-mlong-calls" are enabled in
    Elf32 GCC:
    ----------------------------->8------------------------
    arc-elf32-gcc -mcpu=arc700 -Q --help=target | grep calls
      -mlong-calls                          [disabled]
      -mmedium-calls                        [disabled]
    ----------------------------->8------------------------
    
    Now to make it possible to use Elf32 toolchain for building Linux kernel
    we're explicitly add "-mmedium-calls" to CFLAGS.
    
    And since we add "-mmedium-calls" to the global CFLAGS there's no point in
    having per-file copies thus removing them.

    drm/bridge/sii8620: fix potential buffer overflow
    
    [ Upstream commit 9378cecb1ce5d618b8aff4d65113ddcf72fc1011 ]
    
    Buffer overflow error should not occur, as mode_fixup() callback
    filters pixel clock value and it should never exceed 600000. However,
    current implementation is not obviously safe and relies on
    implementation of mode_fixup().
    
    Make 'i' variable never reach unsafe value in order to avoid buffer
    overflow error.

    RDMA/qedr: Fix NULL pointer dereference when running over iWARP without RDMA-CM
    
    [ Upstream commit 425cf5c1350a98b81f3ddda160b99c3be613a213 ]
    
    Some RoCE specific code in qedr_modify_qp was run over an iWARP device
    when running perftest benchmarks without the -R option.
    
    The commit 3e44e0ee0893 ("IB/providers: Avoid null netdev check for RoCE")
    exposed this. Dropping the check for NULL pointer on ndev in
    qedr_modify_qp lead to a null pointer dereference when running over
    iWARP. Before the code would identify ndev as being NULL and return an
    error.

    IB/rxe: avoid double kfree skb
    
    [ Upstream commit 828d810550abc1fffff9b20545fec4bc150d5e82 ]
    
    In rxe_send, when network_type is not RDMA_NETWORK_IPV4 or
    RDMA_NETWORK_IPV6, skb is freed and -EINVAL is returned.
    Then rxe_xmit_packet will return -EINVAL, too. In rxe_requester,
    this skb is double freed.
    In rxe_requester, kfree_skb is needed only after fill_packet fails.
    So kfree_skb is moved from label err to test fill_packet.

    perf tools: Fix error index for pmu event parser

    index, PMU parser is missing that, adding it.

    After:
    
      $ perf stat -e cycles,krava/cycles/ kill
      event syntax error: 'cycles,krava/cycles/'
