    ath9k: fix tx99 potential info leak
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ee0a47186e2fa9aa1c56cadcea470ca0ba8c8692 ]
    
    When the user sets count to zero the string buffer would remain
    completely uninitialized which causes the kernel to parse its
    own stack data, potentially leading to an info leak. In addition
    to that, the string might be not terminated properly when the
    user data does not contain a 0-terminator.

    IB/ipoib: Grab rtnl lock on heavy flush when calling ndo_open/stop
    
    
    [ Upstream commit b4b678b06f6eef18bff44a338c01870234db0bc9 ]
    
    When ndo_open and ndo_stop are called RTNL lock should be held.
    In this specific case ipoib_ib_dev_open calls the offloaded ndo_open
    which re-sets the number of TX queue assuming RTNL lock is held.
    Since RTNL lock is not held, RTNL assert will fail.

    RDMA/cma: Avoid triggering undefined behavior
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c0b64f58e8d49570aa9ee55d880f92c20ff0166b ]
    
    According to the C standard the behavior of computations with
    integer operands is as follows:
    * A computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow,
      because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting
      unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one
      greater than the largest value that can be represented by the
      resulting type.
    * The behavior for signed integer underflow and overflow is
      undefined.
    
    Hence only use unsigned integers when checking for integer
    overflow.
    
    This patch is what I came up with after having analyzed the
    following smatch warnings:
    
    drivers/infiniband/core/cma.c:3448: cma_resolve_ib_udp() warn: signed overflow undefined. 'offset + conn_param->private_data_len < conn_param->private_data_len'
    drivers/infiniband/core/cma.c:3505: cma_connect_ib() warn: signed overflow undefined. 'offset + conn_param->private_data_len < conn_param->private_data_len'

    macvlan: Only deliver one copy of the frame to the macvlan interface
    
    
    [ Upstream commit dd6b9c2c332b40f142740d1b11fb77c653ff98ea ]
    
    This patch intoduces a slight adjustment for macvlan to address the fact
    that in source mode I was seeing two copies of any packet addressed to the
    macvlan interface being delivered where there should have been only one.
    
    The issue appears to be that one copy was delivered based on the source MAC
    address and then the second copy was being delivered based on the
    destination MAC address. To fix it I am just treating a unicast address
    match as though it is not a match since source based macvlan isn't supposed
    to be matching based on the destination MAC anyway.

    [ Upstream commit 3e351275655d3c84dc28abf170def9786db5176d ]
    
    We could allocate less memory than intended because we do:
    
            bfad->regdata = kzalloc(len << 2, GFP_KERNEL);
    
    The shift can overflow leading to a crash.  This is debugfs code so the
    impact is very small.  I fixed the network version of this in March with
    commit 13e2d5187f6b ("bna: integer overflow bug in debugfs").

    raid5: Set R5_Expanded on parity devices as well as data.
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 235b6003fb28f0dd8e7ed8fbdb088bb548291766 ]
    
    When reshaping a fully degraded raid5/raid6 to a larger
    nubmer of devices, the new device(s) are not in-sync
    and so that can make the newly grown stripe appear to be
    "failed".
    To avoid this, we set the R5_Expanded flag to say "Even though
    this device is not fully in-sync, this block is safe so
    don't treat the device as failed for this stripe".
    This flag is set for data devices, not not for parity devices.
    
    Consequently, if you have a RAID6 with two devices that are partly
    recovered and a spare, and start a reshape to include the spare,
    then when the reshape gets past the point where the recovery was
    up to, it will think the stripes are failed and will get into
    an infinite loop, failing to make progress.
    
    So when contructing parity on an EXPAND_READY stripe,
    set R5_Expanded.

    pinctrl: adi2: Fix Kconfig build problem
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1c363531dd814dc4fe10865722bf6b0f72ce4673 ]
    
    The build robot is complaining on Blackfin:
    
    drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-adi2.c: In function 'port_setup':
    >> drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-adi2.c:221:21: error: dereferencing
       pointer to incomplete type 'struct gpio_port_t'
          writew(readw(&regs->port_fer) & ~BIT(offset),
                            ^~
    drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-adi2.c: In function 'adi_gpio_ack_irq':
    >> drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-adi2.c:266:18: error: dereferencing
    pointer to incomplete type 'struct bfin_pint_regs'
          if (readl(&regs->invert_set) & pintbit)
                         ^~
    It seems the driver need to include <asm/gpio.h> and <asm/irq.h>
    to compile.
    
    The Blackfin architecture was re-defining the Kconfig
    PINCTRL symbol which is not OK, so replaced this with
    PINCTRL_BLACKFIN_ADI2 which selects PINCTRL and PINCTRL_ADI2
    just like most arches do.
    
    Further, the old GPIO driver symbol GPIO_ADI was possible to
    select at the same time as selecting PINCTRL. This was not
    working because the arch-local <asm/gpio.h> header contains
    an explicit #ifndef PINCTRL clause making compilation break
    if you combine them. The same is true for DEBUG_MMRS.
    
    Make sure the ADI2 pinctrl driver is not selected at the same
    time as the old GPIO implementation. (This should be converted
    to use gpiolib or pincontrol and move to drivers/...) Also make
    sure the old GPIO_ADI driver or DEBUG_MMRS is not selected at
    the same time as the new PINCTRL implementation, and only make
    PINCTRL_ADI2 selectable for the Blackfin families that actually
    have it.
    
    This way it is still possible to add e.g. I2C-based pin
    control expanders on the Blackfin.

    usb: musb: da8xx: fix babble condition handling
    
    commit bd3486ded7a0c313a6575343e6c2b21d14476645 upstream.
    
    When babble condition happens, the musb controller might automatically
    turns off VBUS. On DA8xx platform, the controller generates drvvbus
    interrupt for turning off VBUS along with the babble interrupt.
    
    In this case, we should handle the babble interrupt first and recover
    from the babble condition.
    
    This change ignores the drvvbus interrupt if babble interrupt is also
    generated at the same time, so the babble recovery routine works
    properly.

    powerpc/perf/hv-24x7: Fix incorrect comparison in memord
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 05c14c03138532a3cb2aa29c2960445c8753343b ]
    
    In the hv-24x7 code there is a function memord() which tries to
    implement a sort function return -1, 0, 1. However one of the
    conditions is incorrect, such that it can never be true, because we
    will have already returned.
    
    I don't believe there is a bug in practice though, because the
    comparisons are an optimisation prior to calling memcmp().
    
    Fix it by swapping the second comparision, so it can be true.

    scsi: hpsa: destroy sas transport properties before scsi_host
    
    
    [ Upstream commit dfb2e6f46b3074eb85203d8f0888b71ec1c2e37a ]
    
    This patch cleans up a lot of warnings when unloading the driver.
    
    A current example of the stack trace starts with:
        [  142.570715] sysfs group 'power' not found for kobject 'port-5:0'
    There can be hundreds of these messages during a driver unload.

    permission.
    
    His original patch can be found here:
    https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg102085.html
    
    This patch did not help until Hannes's
    commit 9441284fbc39 ("scsi-fixup-kernel-warning-during-rmmod")
    was applied to the kernel.

    PCI: Detach driver before procfs & sysfs teardown on device remove
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 16b6c8bb687cc3bec914de09061fcb8411951fda ]
    
    When removing a device, for example a VF being removed due to SR-IOV
    teardown, a "soft" hot-unplug via 'echo 1 > remove' in sysfs, or an actual
    hot-unplug, we first remove the procfs and sysfs attributes for the device
    before attempting to release the device from any driver bound to it.
    Unbinding the driver from the device can take time.  The device might need
    to write out data or it might be actively in use.  If it's in use by
    userspace through a vfio driver, the unbind might block until the user
    releases the device.  This leads to a potentially non-trivial amount of
    time where the device exists, but we've torn down the interfaces that
    userspace uses to examine devices, for instance lspci might generate this
    sort of error:
    
      pcilib: Cannot open /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:0a.3/config
      lspci: Unable to read the standard configuration space header of device 0000:01:0a.3
    
    We don't seem to have any dependence on this teardown ordering in the
    kernel, so let's unbind the driver first, which is also more symmetric with
    the instantiation of the device in pci_bus_add_device().

    xfs: fix incorrect extent state in xfs_bmap_add_extent_unwritten_real
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5e422f5e4fd71d18bc6b851eeb3864477b3d842e ]
    
    There was one spot in xfs_bmap_add_extent_unwritten_real that didn't use the
    passed in new extent state but always converted to normal, leading to wrong
    behavior when converting from normal to unwritten.
    
    Only found by code inspection, it seems like this code path to move partial
    extent from written to unwritten while merging it with the next extent is
    rarely exercised.

    xfs: fix log block underflow during recovery cycle verification
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 9f2a4505800607e537e9dd9dea4f55c4b0c30c7a ]
    
    It is possible for mkfs to format very small filesystems with too
    small of an internal log with respect to the various minimum size
    and block count requirements. If this occurs when the log happens to
    be smaller than the scan window used for cycle verification and the
    scan wraps the end of the log, the start_blk calculation in
    xlog_find_head() underflows and leads to an attempt to scan an
    invalid range of log blocks. This results in log recovery failure
    and a failed mount.
    
    Since there may be filesystems out in the wild with this kind of
    geometry, we cannot simply refuse to mount. Instead, cap the scan
    window for cycle verification to the size of the physical log. This
    ensures that the cycle verification proceeds as expected when the
    scan wraps the end of the log.

    Currently, Cache missed IOs are identified by s->cache_miss, but actually,
    there are many situations that missed IOs are not assigned a value for
    s->cache_miss in cached_dev_cache_miss(), for example, a bypassed IO
    (s->iop.bypass = 1), or the cache_bio allocate failed. In these situations,
    it will go to out_put or out_submit, and s->cache_miss is null, which leads
    bch_mark_cache_accounting() to treat this IO as a hit IO.

    As Coly pointed out in a previous review, bcache_exit() may not be
    able to handle all the references properly if userspace registers
    cache and backing devices right before bch_debug_init runs and
    bch_debug_init failes later. So not exposing userspace interface
    until everything is ready to avoid that issue.

    GFS2: Take inode off order_write list when setting jdata flag
    
    
    [ Upstream commit cc555b09d8c3817aeebda43a14ab67049a5653f7 ]
    
    This patch fixes a deadlock caused when the jdata flag is set for
    inodes that are already on the ordered write list. Since it is
    on the ordered write list, log_flush calls gfs2_ordered_write which
    calls filemap_fdatawrite. But since the inode had the jdata flag
    set, that calls gfs2_jdata_writepages, which tries to start a new
    transaction. A new transaction cannot be started because it tries
    to acquire the log_flush rwsem which is already locked by the log
    flush operation.
    
    The bottom line is: We cannot switch an inode from ordered to jdata
    until we eliminate any ordered data pages (via log flush) or any
    log_flush operation afterward will create the circular dependency
    above. So we need to flush the log before setting the diskflags to
    switch the file mode, then we need to remove the inode from the
    ordered writes list.
    
    Before this patch, the log flush was done for jdata->ordered, but
    that's wrong. If we're going from jdata to ordered, we don't need
    to call gfs2_log_flush because the call to filemap_fdatawrite will
    do it for us:
    
       filemap_fdatawrite() -> __filemap_fdatawrite_range()
          __filemap_fdatawrite_range() -> do_writepages()
             do_writepages() -> gfs2_jdata_writepages()
                gfs2_jdata_writepages() -> gfs2_log_flush()
    
    This patch modifies function do_gfs2_set_flags so that if a file
    has its jdata flag set, and it's already on the ordered write list,
    the log will be flushed and it will be removed from the list
    before setting the flag.

    thermal/drivers/step_wise: Fix temperature regulation misbehavior
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 07209fcf33542c1ff1e29df2dbdf8f29cdaacb10 ]
    
    There is a particular situation when the cooling device is cpufreq and the heat
    dissipation is not efficient enough where the temperature increases little by
    little until reaching the critical threshold and leading to a SoC reset.
    
    The behavior is reproducible on a hikey6220 with bad heat dissipation (eg.
    stacked with other boards).
    
    Running a simple C program doing while(1); for each CPU of the SoC makes the
    temperature to reach the passive regulation trip point and ends up to the
    maximum allowed temperature followed by a reset.
    
    This issue has been also reported by running the libhugetlbfs test suite.
    
    What is observed is a ping pong between two cpu frequencies, 1.2GHz and 900MHz
    while the temperature continues to grow.
    
    It appears the step wise governor calls get_target_state() the first time with
    the throttle set to true and the trend to 'raising'. The code selects logically
    the next state, so the cpu frequency decreases from 1.2GHz to 900MHz, so far so
    good. The temperature decreases immediately but still stays greater than the
    trip point, then get_target_state() is called again, this time with the
    throttle set to true *and* the trend to 'dropping'. From there the algorithm
    assumes we have to step down the state and the cpu frequency jumps back to
    1.2GHz. But the temperature is still higher than the trip point, so
    get_target_state() is called with throttle=1 and trend='raising' again, we jump
    to 900MHz, then get_target_state() is called with throttle=1 and
    trend='dropping', we jump to 1.2GHz, etc ... but the temperature does not
    stabilizes and continues to increase.
    
    [  237.922654] thermal thermal_zone0: Trip0[type=1,temp=65000]:trend=1,throttle=1

    [  238.134679] thermal cooling_device0: cur_state=0
    [  238.134690] thermal cooling_device0: old_target=0, target=1
    
    In this situation the temperature continues to increase while the trend is
    oscillating between 'dropping' and 'raising'. We need to keep the current state
    untouched if the throttle is set, so the temperature can decrease or a higher
    state could be selected, thus preventing this oscillation.
    
    Keeping the next_target untouched when 'throttle' is true at 'dropping' time
    fixes the issue.
    
    The following traces show the governor does not change the next state if
    trend==2 (dropping) and throttle==1.

    IOW, this change is needed to keep the state for a cooling device if the
    temperature trend is oscillating while the temperature increases slightly.
    
    Without this change, the situation above leads to a catastrophic crash by a
    hardware reset on hikey. This issue has been reported to happen on an OMAP
    dra7xx also.

    clk: imx6: refine hdmi_isfr's parent to make HDMI work on i.MX6 SoCs w/o VPU
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c68ee58d9ee7b856ac722f18f4f26579c8fbd2b4 ]
    
    On i.MX6 SoCs without VPU (in my case MCIMX6D4AVT10AC), the hdmi driver
    fails to probe:
    
    [    2.540030] dwhdmi-imx 120000.hdmi: Unsupported HDMI controller
    (0000:00:00)
    [    2.548199] imx-drm display-subsystem: failed to bind 120000.hdmi
    (ops dw_hdmi_imx_ops): -19
    [    2.557403] imx-drm display-subsystem: master bind failed: -19
    
    That's because hdmi_isfr's parent, video_27m, is not correctly ungated.
    As explained in commit 5ccc248cc537 ("ARM: imx6q: clk: Add support for
    mipi_core_cfg clock as a shared clock gate"), video_27m is gated by
    CCM_CCGR3[CG8].
    
    On i.MX6 SoCs with VPU, the hdmi is working thanks to the
    CCM_CMEOR[mod_en_ov_vpu] bit which makes the video_27m ungated whatever
    is in CCM_CCGR3[CG8]. The issue can be reproduced by setting
    CCMEOR[mod_en_ov_vpu] to 0.
    
    Make the HDMI work in every case by setting hdmi_isfr's parent to
    mipi_core_cfg.

    powerpc/opal: Fix EBUSY bug in acquiring tokens
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 71e24d7731a2903b1ae2bba2b2971c654d9c2aa6 ]
    
    The current code checks the completion map to look for the first token
    that is complete. In some cases, a completion can come in but the
    token can still be on lease to the caller processing the completion.
    If this completed but unreleased token is the first token found in the
    bitmap by another tasks trying to acquire a token, then the
    __test_and_set_bit call will fail since the token will still be on
    lease. The acquisition will then fail with an EBUSY.
    
    This patch reorganizes the acquisition code to look at the
    opal_async_token_map for an unleased token. If the token has no lease
    it must have no outstanding completions so we should never see an
    EBUSY, unless we have leased out too many tokens. Since
    opal_async_get_token_inrerruptible is protected by a semaphore, we
    will practically never see EBUSY anymore.

    PCI/PME: Handle invalid data when reading Root Status
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 3ad3f8ce50914288731a3018b27ee44ab803e170 ]
    
    PCIe PME and native hotplug share the same interrupt number, so hotplug
    interrupts are also processed by PME.  In some cases, e.g., a Link Down
    interrupt, a device may be present but unreachable, so when we try to
    read its Root Status register, the read fails and we get all ones data
    (0xffffffff).
    
    Previously, we interpreted that data as PCI_EXP_RTSTA_PME being set, i.e.,
    "some device has asserted PME," so we scheduled pcie_pme_work_fn().  This
    caused an infinite loop because pcie_pme_work_fn() tried to handle PME
    requests until PCI_EXP_RTSTA_PME is cleared, but with the link down,
    PCI_EXP_RTSTA_PME can't be cleared.
    
    Check for the invalid 0xffffffff data everywhere we read the Root Status
    register.
    
    1469d17dd341 ("PCI: pciehp: Handle invalid data when reading from
    non-existent devices") added similar checks in the hotplug driver.

    [ Upstream commit 288e7560e4d3e259aa28f8f58a8dfe63627a1bf6 ]
    
    The used 0x1f mask is only valid for am335x family of SoC, different family
    using this type of crossbar might have different number of electable
    events. In case of am43xx family 0x3f mask should have been used for
    example.
    Instead of trying to handle each family's mask, just use u8 type to store
    the mux value since the event offsets are aligned to byte offset.

    target: fix race during implicit transition work flushes
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 760bf578edf8122f2503a3a6a3f4b0de3b6ce0bb ]
    
    This fixes the following races:
    
    1. core_alua_do_transition_tg_pt could have read
    tg_pt_gp_alua_access_state and gone into this if chunk:
    
    if (!explicit &&
            atomic_read(&tg_pt_gp->tg_pt_gp_alua_access_state) ==
               ALUA_ACCESS_STATE_TRANSITION) {
    
    and then core_alua_do_transition_tg_pt_work could update the
    state. core_alua_do_transition_tg_pt would then only set
    tg_pt_gp_alua_pending_state and the tg_pt_gp_alua_access_state would
    not get updated with the second calls state.
    
    2. core_alua_do_transition_tg_pt could be setting
    tg_pt_gp_transition_complete while the tg_pt_gp_transition_work
    is already completing. core_alua_do_transition_tg_pt then waits on the
    completion that will never be called.
    
    To handle these issues, we just call flush_work which will return when
    core_alua_do_transition_tg_pt_work has completed so there is no need
    to do the complete/wait. And, if core_alua_do_transition_tg_pt_work
    was running, instead of trying to sneak in the state change, we just
    schedule up another core_alua_do_transition_tg_pt_work call.
    
    Note that this does not handle a possible race where there are multiple
    threads call core_alua_do_transition_tg_pt at the same time. I think
    we need a mutex in target_tg_pt_gp_alua_access_state_store.

    The implicit transition time tells initiators the min time

    the transition to occur in tg_pt_gp_implicit_trans_secs
    seconds so there is no room for delays. If
    core_alua_do_transition_tg_pt_work->core_alua_update_tpg_primary_metadata
    needs to write out info to a remote file, then the initiator can
    easily time out the operation.

    target: Use system workqueue for ALUA transitions
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 207ee84133c00a8a2a5bdec94df4a5b37d78881c ]
    
    If tcmu-runner is processing a STPG and needs to change the kernel's
    ALUA state then we cannot use the same work queue for task management
    requests and ALUA transitions, because we could deadlock. The problem
    occurs when a STPG times out before tcmu-runner is able to
    call into target_tg_pt_gp_alua_access_state_store->
    core_alua_do_port_transition -> core_alua_do_transition_tg_pt ->
    queue_work. In this case, the tmr is on the work queue waiting for
    the STPG to complete, but the STPG transition is now queued behind
    the waiting tmr.
    
    Note:
    This bug will also be fixed by this patch:
    http://www.spinics.net/lists/target-devel/msg14560.html
    which switches the tmr code to use the system workqueues.
    
    For both, I am not sure if we need a dedicated workqueue since
    it is not a performance path and I do not think we need WQ_MEM_RECLAIM
    to make forward progress to free up memory like the block layer does.

    btrfs: add missing memset while reading compressed inline extents
    
    
    [ Upstream commit e1699d2d7bf6e6cce3e1baff19f9dd4595a58664 ]
    
    This is a story about 4 distinct (and very old) btrfs bugs.
    
    Commit c8b978188c ("Btrfs: Add zlib compression support") added
    three data corruption bugs for inline extents (bugs #1-3).
    
    Commit 93c82d5750 ("Btrfs: zero page past end of inline file items")
    fixed bug #1:  uncompressed inline extents followed by a hole and more
    extents could get non-zero data in the hole as they were read.  The fix
    was to add a memset in btrfs_get_extent to zero out the hole.
    
    Commit 166ae5a418 ("btrfs: fix inline compressed read err corruption")
    fixed bug #2:  compressed inline extents which contained non-zero bytes
    might be replaced with zero bytes in some cases.  This patch removed an
    unhelpful memset from uncompress_inline, but the case where memset is
    required was missed.
    
    There is also a memset in the decompression code, but this only covers
    decompressed data that is shorter than the ram_bytes from the extent
    ref record.  This memset doesn't cover the region between the end of the
    decompressed data and the end of the page.  It has also moved around a
    few times over the years, so there's no single patch to refer to.
    
    This patch fixes bug #3:  compressed inline extents followed by a hole
    and more extents could get non-zero data in the hole as they were read
    (i.e. bug #3 is the same as bug #1, but s/uncompressed/compressed/).
    The fix is the same:  zero out the hole in the compressed case too,
    by putting a memset back in uncompress_inline, but this time with
    correct parameters.
    
    The last and oldest bug, bug #0, is the cause of the offending inline
    extent/hole/extent pattern.  Bug #0 is a subtle and mostly-harmless quirk
    of behavior somewhere in the btrfs write code.  In a few special cases,
    an inline extent and hole are allowed to persist where they normally
    would be combined with later extents in the file.
    
    A fast reproducer for bug #0 is presented below.  A few offending extents
    are also created in the wild during large rsync transfers with the -S
    flag.  A Linux kernel build (git checkout; make allyesconfig; make -j8)
    will produce a handful of offending files as well.  Once an offending
    file is created, it can present different content to userspace each
    time it is read.
    
    Bug #0 is at least 4 and possibly 8 years old.  I verified every vX.Y
    kernel back to v3.5 has this behavior.  There are fossil records of this
    bug's effects in commits all the way back to v2.6.32.  I have no reason
    to believe bug #0 wasn't present at the beginning of btrfs compression
    support in v2.6.29, but I can't easily test kernels that old to be sure.
    
    It is not clear whether bug #0 is worth fixing.  A fix would likely
    require injecting extra reads into currently write-only paths, and most
    of the exceptional cases caused by bug #0 are already handled now.
    
    Whether we like them or not, bug #0's inline extents followed by holes
    are part of the btrfs de-facto disk format now, and we need to be able
    to read them without data corruption or an infoleak.  So enough about
    bug #0, let's get back to bug #3 (this patch).
    
    An example of on-disk structure leading to data corruption found in
    the wild:
    
            item 61 key (606890 INODE_ITEM 0) itemoff 9662 itemsize 160
                    inode generation 50 transid 50 size 47424 nbytes 49141
                    block group 0 mode 100644 links 1 uid 0 gid 0
                    rdev 0 flags 0x0(none)
            item 62 key (606890 INODE_REF 603050) itemoff 9642 itemsize 20
                    inode ref index 3 namelen 10 name: DB_File.so
            item 63 key (606890 EXTENT_DATA 0) itemoff 8280 itemsize 1362
                    inline extent data size 1341 ram 4085 compress(zlib)
            item 64 key (606890 EXTENT_DATA 4096) itemoff 8227 itemsize 53
                    extent data disk byte 5367308288 nr 20480
                    extent data offset 0 nr 45056 ram 45056
                    extent compression(zlib)
    
    Different data appears in userspace during each read of the 11 bytes
    between 4085 and 4096.  The extent in item 63 is not long enough to
    fill the first page of the file, so a memset is required to fill the
    space between item 63 (ending at 4085) and item 64 (beginning at 4096)
    with zero.
    
    Here is a reproducer from Liu Bo, which demonstrates another method
    of creating the same inline extent and hole pattern:
    
    Using 'page_poison=on' kernel command line (or enable
    CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING) run the following:
    
            # touch foo
            # chattr +c foo
            # xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -W 0 1000" foo
            # xfs_io -f -c "falloc 4 8188" foo
            # od -x foo
            # echo 3 >/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
            # od -x foo
    
    This produce the following on my box:
    
    Correct output:  file contains 1000 data bytes followed
    by zeros:
    
            0000000 cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd
            *
            0001740 cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd 0000 0000 0000 0000

            *
            0020000
    
    Actual output:  the data after the first 1000 bytes
    will be different each run:
    
            0000000 cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd
            *

    efi/esrt: Cleanup bad memory map log messages
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 822f5845f710e57d7e2df1fd1ee00d6e19d334fe ]
    
    The Intel Compute Stick STCK1A8LFC and Weibu F3C platforms both
    log 2 error messages during boot:
    
       efi: requested map not found.
       esrt: ESRT header is not in the memory map.
    
    Searching the web, this seems to affect many other platforms too.
    Since these messages are logged as errors, they appear on-screen during

    distros.
    
    Demote the ESRT error to a warning so that it does not appear on-screen,
    and delete the error logging from efi_mem_desc_lookup; both callsites
    of that function log more specific messages upon failure.
    
    Out of curiosity I looked closer at the Weibu F3C. There is no entry in
    the UEFI-provided memory map which corresponds to the ESRT pointer, but
    hacking the code to map it anyway, the ESRT does appear to be valid with
    2 entries.

    perf symbols: Fix symbols__fixup_end heuristic for corner cases
    
    
    [ Upstream commit e7ede72a6d40cb3a30c087142d79381ca8a31dab ]
    
    The current symbols__fixup_end() heuristic for the last entry in the rb
    tree is suboptimal as it leads to not being able to recognize the symbol
    in the call graph in a couple of corner cases, for example:
    
     i) If the symbol has a start address (f.e. exposed via kallsyms)
        that is at a page boundary, then the roundup(curr->start, 4096)
        for the last entry will result in curr->start == curr->end with
        a symbol length of zero.
    
    ii) If the symbol has a start address that is shortly before a page
        boundary, then also here, curr->end - curr->start will just be
        very few bytes, where it's unrealistic that we could perform a
        match against.
    
    Instead, change the heuristic to roundup(curr->start, 4096) + 4096, so
    that we can catch such corner cases and have a better chance to find
    that specific symbol. It's still just best effort as the real end of the
    symbol is unknown to us (and could even be at a larger offset than the
    current range), but better than the current situation.
    
    Alexei reported that he recently run into case i) with a JITed eBPF
    program (these are all page aligned) as the last symbol which wasn't
    properly shown in the call graph (while other eBPF program symbols in
    the rb tree were displayed correctly). Since this is a generic issue,
    lets try to improve the heuristic a bit.

    net/mlx4_core: Avoid delays during VF driver device shutdown
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 4cbe4dac82e423ecc9a0ba46af24a860853259f4 ]
    
    Some Hypervisors detach VFs from VMs by instantly causing an FLR event
    to be generated for a VF.
    
    In the mlx4 case, this will cause that VF's comm channel to be disabled
    before the VM has an opportunity to invoke the VF device's "shutdown"
    method.
    
    For such Hypervisors, there is a race condition between the VF's
    shutdown method and its internal-error detection/reset thread.
    
    The internal-error detection/reset thread (which runs every 5 seconds) also
    detects a disabled comm channel. If the internal-error detection/reset
    flow wins the race, we still get delays (while that flow tries repeatedly
    to detect comm-channel recovery).
    
    The cited commit fixed the command timeout problem when the
    internal-error detection/reset flow loses the race.
    
    This commit avoids the unneeded delays when the internal-error
    detection/reset flow wins.

    afs: Fix afs_kill_pages()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7286a35e893176169b09715096a4aca557e2ccd2 ]
    
    Fix afs_kill_pages() in two ways:
    
     (1) If a writeback has been partially flushed, then if we try and kill the
         pages it contains, some of them may no longer be undergoing writeback
         and end_page_writeback() will assert.
    
         Fix this by checking to see whether the page in question is actually
         undergoing writeback before ending that writeback.
    
     (2) The loop that scans for pages to kill doesn't increase the first page
         index, and so the loop may not terminate, but it will try to process
         the same pages over and over again.
    
         Fix this by increasing the first page index to one after the last page
         we processed.

    [ Upstream commit ab94f5d0dd6fd82e7eeca5e7c8096eaea0a0261f ]
    
    The inode timestamps should be set from the client time
    in the status received from the server, rather than the
    server time which is meant for internal server use.
    
    Set AFS_SET_MTIME and populate the mtime for operations
    that take an input status, such as file/dir creation
    and StoreData.  If an input time is not provided the
    server will set the vnode times based on the current server
    time.
    
    In a situation where the server has some skew with the
    client, this could lead to the client seeing a timestamp
    in the future for a file that it just created or wrote.

    isn't signed, this doesn't get sign-extended to 64-bits when placed in a

    sched/deadline: Use deadline instead of period when calculating overflow
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 2317d5f1c34913bac5971d93d69fb6c31bb74670 ]
    
    I was testing Daniel's changes with his test case, and tweaked it a
    little. Instead of having the runtime equal to the deadline, I
    increased the deadline ten fold.
    
    Daniel's test case had:
    
            attr.sched_runtime  = 2 * 1000 * 1000;          /* 2 ms */
            attr.sched_deadline = 2 * 1000 * 1000;          /* 2 ms */
            attr.sched_period   = 2 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000;   /* 2 s */
    
    To make it more interesting, I changed it to:
    
            attr.sched_runtime  =  2 * 1000 * 1000;         /* 2 ms */
            attr.sched_deadline = 20 * 1000 * 1000;         /* 20 ms */
            attr.sched_period   =  2 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000;  /* 2 s */
    
    The results were rather surprising. The behavior that Daniel's patch
    was fixing came back. The task started using much more than .1% of the
    CPU. More like 20%.
    
    Looking into this I found that it was due to the dl_entity_overflow()
    constantly returning true. That's because it uses the relative period
    against relative runtime vs the absolute deadline against absolute
    runtime.
    
      runtime / (deadline - t) > dl_runtime / dl_period
    
    There's even a comment mentioning this, and saying that when relative
    deadline equals relative period, that the equation is the same as using
    deadline instead of period. That comment is backwards! What we really
    want is:
    
      runtime / (deadline - t) > dl_runtime / dl_deadline
    
    We care about if the runtime can make its deadline, not its period. And
    then we can say "when the deadline equals the period, the equation is
    the same as using dl_period instead of dl_deadline".
    
    After correcting this, now when the task gets enqueued, it can throttle
    correctly, and Daniel's fix to the throttling of sleeping deadline
    tasks works even when the runtime and deadline are not the same.

    sched/deadline: Throttle a constrained deadline task activated after the deadline
    
    
    [ Upstream commit df8eac8cafce7d086be3bd5cf5a838fa37594dfb ]
    
    During the activation, CBS checks if it can reuse the current task's
    runtime and period. If the deadline of the task is in the past, CBS
    cannot use the runtime, and so it replenishes the task. This rule
    works fine for implicit deadline tasks (deadline == period), and the
    CBS was designed for implicit deadline tasks. However, a task with
    constrained deadline (deadine < period) might be awakened after the
    deadline, but before the next period. In this case, replenishing the
    task would allow it to run for runtime / deadline. As in this case
    deadline < period, CBS enables a task to run for more than the
    runtime / period. In a very loaded system, this can cause a domino
    effect, making other tasks miss their deadlines.
    
    To avoid this problem, in the activation of a constrained deadline
    task after the deadline but before the next period, throttle the
    task and set the replenishing timer to the begin of the next period,
    unless it is boosted.

    sched/deadline: Make sure the replenishment timer fires in the next period
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ac69d37784b237707a7b15d199cdb6c6fdb6780 ]
    
    Currently, the replenishment timer is set to fire at the deadline
    of a task. Although that works for implicit deadline tasks because the
    deadline is equals to the begin of the next period, that is not correct
    for constrained deadline tasks (deadline < period).
    
    For instance:
    
    f.c:
     --------------- %< ---------------
    int main (void)
    {
            for(;;);
    }
     --------------- >% ---------------
    
      # gcc -o f f.c
    
      # trace-cmd record -e sched:sched_switch                              \
                                       -e syscalls:sys_exit_sched_setattr   \
       chrt -d --sched-runtime  490000000                                   \
               --sched-deadline 500000000                                   \
               --sched-period  1000000000 0 ./f
    
      # trace-cmd report | grep "{pid of ./f}"
    
    After setting parameters, the task is replenished and continue running
    until being throttled:
    
             f-11295 [003] 13322.113776: sys_exit_sched_setattr: 0x0
    
    The task is throttled after running 492318 ms, as expected:
    
             f-11295 [003] 13322.606094: sched_switch:   f:11295 [-1] R ==> watchdog/3:32 [0]
    
    But then, the task is replenished 500719 ms after the first
    replenishment:
    
        <idle>-0     [003] 13322.614495: sched_switch:   swapper/3:0 [120] R ==> f:11295 [-1]
    
    Running for 490277 ms:
    
             f-11295 [003] 13323.104772: sched_switch:   f:11295 [-1] R ==>  swapper/3:0 [120]
    
    Hence, in the first period, the task runs 2 * runtime, and that is a bug.
    
    During the first replenishment, the next deadline is set one period away.
    So the runtime / period starts to be respected. However, as the second
    replenishment took place in the wrong instant, the next replenishment
    will also be held in a wrong instant of time. Rather than occurring in
    the nth period away from the first activation, it is taking place
    in the (nth period - relative deadline).

    This patch fixes netdev->features for Extended Socket network device.
    
    Currently Extended Socket network device's netdev->feature claims
    NETIF_F_HW_CSUM, however this is completely wrong. There's no feature
    of checksum offloading.
    That causes invalid TCP/UDP checksum and packet rejection when IP
    forwarding from Extended Socket network device to other network device.
    
    NETIF_F_HW_CSUM should be omitted.

    [ Upstream commit 4a3a485b1ed0e109718cc8c9d094fa0f552de9b2 ]
    
    When WB_registered flag is not set, wb_queue_work() skips queuing the
    work, but does not perform the necessary clean up. In particular, if
    work->auto_free is true, it should free the memory.
    
    The leak condition can be reprouced by following these steps:
    
       mount /dev/sdb /mnt/sdb
       /* In qemu console: device_del sdb */
       umount /dev/sdb
    
    Above will result in a wb_queue_work() call on an unregistered wb and
    thus leak memory.

    omap_gem_dmabuf_mmap() returns an error (with a WARN) when called for a

    buffers, and just removing the if() fixes the limitation.

    Input: i8042 - add TUXEDO BU1406 (N24_25BU) to the nomux list
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a4c2a13129f7c5bcf81704c06851601593303fd5 ]
    
    TUXEDO BU1406 does not implement active multiplexing mode properly,
    and takes around 550 ms in i8042_set_mux_mode(). Given that the
    device does not have external AUX port, there is no downside in
    disabling the MUX mode.

    NFSD: fix nfsd_reset_versions for NFSv4.
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 800a938f0bf9130c8256116649c0cc5806bfb2fd ]
    
    If you write "-2 -3 -4" to the "versions" file, it will
    notice that no versions are enabled, and nfsd_reset_versions()
    is called.
    This enables all major versions, not no minor versions.
    So we lose the invariant that NFSv4 is only advertised when
    at least one minor is enabled.
    
    Fix the code to explicitly enable minor versions for v4,
    change it to use nfsd_vers() to test and set, and simplify
    the code.

    net: bcmgenet: Power up the internal PHY before probing the MII
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6be371b053dc86f11465cc1abce2e99bda0a0574 ]
    
    When using the internal PHY it must be powered up when the MII is probed
    or the PHY will not be detected.  Since the PHY is powered up at reset
    this has not been a problem.  However, when the kernel is restarted with
    kexec the PHY will likely be powered down when the kernel starts so it
    will not be detected and the Ethernet link will not be established.
    
    This commit explicitly powers up the internal PHY when the GENET driver
    is probed to correct this behavior.

    __do_fault assumes vmf->page has been initialized and is valid if

    This VM_FAULT_NOPAGE case is only invoked when signal are pending and it
    didn't matter for anonymous memory before.  It only started to matter
    since shmem was introduced.  hugetlbfs also takes a different path and
    doesn't exercise __do_fault.

    The driver doesn't have a struct of_device_id table but supported devices
    are registered via Device Trees. This is working on the assumption that a
    I2C device registered via OF will always match a legacy I2C device ID and
    that the MODALIAS reported will always be of the form i2c:<device>.
    
    But this could change in the future so the correct approach is to have an
    OF device ID table if the devices are registered via OF.

    KEYS: add missing permission check for request_key() destination
    
    commit 4dca6ea1d9432052afb06baf2e3ae78188a4410b upstream.
    
    When the request_key() syscall is not passed a destination keyring, it
    links the requested key (if constructed) into the "default" request-key
    keyring.  This should require Write permission to the keyring.  However,
    there is actually no permission check.
    
    This can be abused to add keys to any keyring to which only Search
    permission is granted.  This is because Search permission allows joining
    the keyring.  keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring(KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_SESSION_KEYRING)
    then will set the default request-key keyring to the session keyring.
    Then, request_key() can be used to add keys to the keyring.
    
    Both negatively and positively instantiated keys can be added using this
    method.  Adding negative keys is trivial.  Adding a positive key is a
    bit trickier.  It requires that either /sbin/request-key positively
    instantiates the key, or that another thread adds the key to the process
    keyring at just the right time, such that request_key() misses it
    initially but then finds it in construct_alloc_key().
    
    Fix this bug by checking for Write permission to the keyring in
    construct_get_dest_keyring() when the default keyring is being used.
    
    We don't do the permission check for non-default keyrings because that
    was already done by the earlier call to lookup_user_key().  Also,
    request_key_and_link() is currently passed a 'struct key *' rather than
    a key_ref_t, so the "possessed" bit is unavailable.
    
    We also don't do the permission check for the "requestor keyring", to
    continue to support the use case described by commit 8bbf4976b59f
    ("KEYS: Alter use of key instantiation link-to-keyring argument") where
    /sbin/request-key recursively calls request_key() to add keys to the
    original requestor's destination keyring.  (I don't know of any users
    who actually do that, though...)

    ext4: fix crash when a directory's i_size is too small
    
    commit 9d5afec6b8bd46d6ed821aa1579634437f58ef1f upstream.
    
    On a ppc64 machine, when mounting a fuzzed ext2 image (generated by
    fsfuzzer) the following call trace is seen,
    
    VFS: brelse: Trying to free free buffer
    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 6913 at /root/repos/linux/fs/buffer.c:1165 .__brelse.part.6+0x24/0x40

    .SyS_newfstatat+0x48/0x80
    system_call+0x58/0x6c
    
    This happens because the directory that ext4_find_entry() looks up has
    inode->i_size that is less than the block size of the filesystem. This
    causes 'nblocks' to have a value of zero. ext4_bread_batch() ends up not
    reading any of the directory file's blocks. This renders the entries in
    bh_use[] array to continue to have garbage data. buffer_uptodate() on
    bh_use[0] can then return a zero value upon which brelse() function is
    invoked.
    
    This commit fixes the bug by returning -ENOENT when the directory file
    has no associated blocks.

    ext4: fix fdatasync(2) after fallocate(2) operation
    
    commit c894aa97577e47d3066b27b32499ecf899bfa8b0 upstream.
    
    Currently, fallocate(2) with KEEP_SIZE followed by a fdatasync(2)
    then crash, we'll see wrong allocated block number (stat -c %b), the
    blocks allocated beyond EOF are all lost. fstests generic/468
    exposes this bug.
    
    Commit 67a7d5f561f4 ("ext4: fix fdatasync(2) after extent
    manipulation operations") fixed all the other extent manipulation
    operation paths such as hole punch, zero range, collapse range etc.,
    but forgot the fallocate case.
    
    So similarly, fix it by recording the correct journal tid in ext4
    inode in fallocate(2) path, so that ext4_sync_file() will wait for
    the right tid to be committed on fdatasync(2).
    
    This addresses the test failure in xfstests test generic/468.

    commit 6f6a23a213be51728502b88741ba6a10cda2441d upstream.
    
    Commit adfa543e7314 ("dmatest: don't use set_freezable_with_signal()")
    introduced a bug (that is in fact documented by the patch commit text)
    that leaves behind a dangling pointer. Since the done_wait structure is
    allocated on the stack, future invocations to the DMATEST can produce
    undesirable results (e.g., corrupted spinlocks).
    
    Commit a9df21e34b42 ("dmaengine: dmatest: warn user when dma test times
    out") attempted to WARN the user that the stack was likely corrupted but
    did not fix the actual issue.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by pushing the wait queue and callback
    structs into the the thread structure. If a failure occurs due to time,
    dmaengine_terminate_all will force the callback to safely call
    wake_up_all() without possibility of using a freed pointer.

    sched/rt: Do not pull from current CPU if only one CPU to pull
    
    commit f73c52a5bcd1710994e53fbccc378c42b97a06b6 upstream.
    
    Daniel Wagner reported a crash on the BeagleBone Black SoC.
    
    This is a single CPU architecture, and does not have a functional
    arch_send_call_function_single_ipi() implementation which can crash
    the kernel if that is called.
    
    As it only has one CPU, it shouldn't be called, but if the kernel is
    compiled for SMP, the push/pull RT scheduling logic now calls it for
    irq_work if the one CPU is overloaded, it can use that function to call
    itself and crash the kernel.
    
    Ideally, we should disable the SCHED_FEAT(RT_PUSH_IPI) if the system
    only has a single CPU. But SCHED_FEAT is a constant if sched debugging
    is turned off. Another fix can also be used, and this should also help
    with normal SMP machines. That is, do not initiate the pull code if
    there's only one RT overloaded CPU, and that CPU happens to be the
    current CPU that is scheduling in a lower priority task.
    
    Even on a system with many CPUs, if there's many RT tasks waiting to
    run on a single CPU, and that CPU schedules in another RT task of lower
    priority, it will initiate the PULL logic in case there's a higher
    priority RT task on another CPU that is waiting to run. But if there is
    no other CPU with waiting RT tasks, it will initiate the RT pull logic
    on itself (as it still has RT tasks waiting to run). This is a wasted
    effort.
    
    Not only does this help with SMP code where the current CPU is the only
    one with RT overloaded tasks, it should also solve the issue that
    Daniel encountered, because it will prevent the PULL logic from
    executing, as there's only one CPU on the system, and the check added
    here will cause it to exit the RT pull code.

    Bluetooth: btusb: driver to enable the usb-wakeup feature
    
    commit a0085f2510e8976614ad8f766b209448b385492f upstream.
    
    BT-Controller connected as platform non-root-hub device and
    usb-driver initialize such device with wakeup disabled,
    Ref. usb_new_device().
    
    At present wakeup-capability get enabled by hid-input device from usb
    function driver(e.g. BT HID device) at runtime. Again some functional
    driver does not set usb-wakeup capability(e.g LE HID device implement
    as HID-over-GATT), and can't wakeup the host on USB.
    
    Most of the device operation (such as mass storage) initiated from host
    (except HID) and USB wakeup aligned with host resume procedure. For BT
    device, usb-wakeup capability need to enable form btusc driver as a
    generic solution for multiple profile use case and required for USB remote
    wakeup (in-bus wakeup) while host is suspended. Also usb-wakeup feature
    need to enable/disable with HCI interface up and down.

    USB: core: prevent malicious bNumInterfaces overflow
    
    commit 48a4ff1c7bb5a32d2e396b03132d20d552c0eca7 upstream.
    
    A malicious USB device with crafted descriptors can cause the kernel
    to access unallocated memory by setting the bNumInterfaces value too
    high in a configuration descriptor.  Although the value is adjusted
    during parsing, this adjustment is skipped in one of the error return
    paths.
    
    This patch prevents the problem by setting bNumInterfaces to 0
    initially.  The existing code already sets it to the proper value
    after parsing is complete.

    USB: uas and storage: Add US_FL_BROKEN_FUA for another JMicron JMS567 ID
    
    commit 62354454625741f0569c2cbe45b2d192f8fd258e upstream.
    
    There is another JMS567-based USB3 UAS enclosure (152d:0578) that fails
    with the following error:
    
    [sda] tag#0 FAILED Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE
    [sda] tag#0 Sense Key : Illegal Request [current]
    [sda] tag#0 Add. Sense: Invalid field in cdb
    
    The issue occurs both with UAS (occasionally) and mass storage
    (immediately after mounting a FS on a disk in the enclosure).
    
    Enabling US_FL_BROKEN_FUA quirk solves this issue.
    
    This patch adds an UNUSUAL_DEV with US_FL_BROKEN_FUA for the enclosure
    for both UAS and mass storage.

    tracing: Allocate mask_str buffer dynamically
    
    commit 90e406f96f630c07d631a021fd4af10aac913e77 upstream.
    
    The default NR_CPUS can be very large, but actual possible nr_cpu_ids
    usually is very small. For my x86 distribution, the NR_CPUS is 8192 and
    nr_cpu_ids is 4. About 2 pages are wasted.
    
    Most machines don't have so many CPUs, so define a array with NR_CPUS
    just wastes memory. So let's allocate the buffer dynamically when need.
    
    With this change, the mutext tracing_cpumask_update_lock also can be
    removed now, which was used to protect mask_str.

    crypto: salsa20 - fix blkcipher_walk API usage
    
    commit ecaaab5649781c5a0effdaf298a925063020500e upstream.
    
    When asked to encrypt or decrypt 0 bytes, both the generic and x86
    implementations of Salsa20 crash in blkcipher_walk_done(), either when
    doing 'kfree(walk->buffer)' or 'free_page((unsigned long)walk->page)',
    because walk->buffer and walk->page have not been initialized.
    
    The bug is that Salsa20 is calling blkcipher_walk_done() even when
    nothing is in 'walk.nbytes'.  But blkcipher_walk_done() is only meant to
    be called when a nonzero number of bytes have been provided.
    
    The broken code is part of an optimization that tries to make only one
    call to salsa20_encrypt_bytes() to process inputs that are not evenly
    divisible by 64 bytes.  To fix the bug, just remove this "optimization"
    and use the blkcipher_walk API the same way all the other users do.

    crypto: hmac - require that the underlying hash algorithm is unkeyed
    
    commit af3ff8045bbf3e32f1a448542e73abb4c8ceb6f1 upstream.
    
    Because the HMAC template didn't check that its underlying hash
    algorithm is unkeyed, trying to use "hmac(hmac(sha3-512-generic))"
    through AF_ALG or through KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE resulted in the inner HMAC
    being used without having been keyed, resulting in sha3_update() being
    called without sha3_init(), causing a stack buffer overflow.
    
    This is a very old bug, but it seems to have only started causing real
    problems when SHA-3 support was added (requires CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA3)
    because the innermost hash's state is ->import()ed from a zeroed buffer,
    and it just so happens that other hash algorithms are fine with that,
    but SHA-3 is not.  However, there could be arch or hardware-dependent
    hash algorithms also affected; I couldn't test everything.
    
    Fix the bug by introducing a function crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey()
    which tests whether a shash algorithm is keyed.  Then update the HMAC
    template to require that its underlying hash algorithm is unkeyed.
    
    Here is a reproducer:
    
        #include <linux/if_alg.h>
        #include <sys/socket.h>
    
        int main()
        {
            int algfd;
            struct sockaddr_alg addr = {
                .salg_type = "hash",
                .salg_name = "hmac(hmac(sha3-512-generic))",
            };
            char key[4096] = { 0 };
    
            algfd = socket(AF_ALG, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);
            bind(algfd, (const struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr));
            setsockopt(algfd, SOL_ALG, ALG_SET_KEY, key, sizeof(key));
