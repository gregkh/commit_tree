    ALSA: seq: Cover unsubscribe_port() in list_mutex
    
    commit 7c32ae35fbf9cffb7aa3736f44dec10c944ca18e upstream.
    
    The call of unsubscribe_port() which manages the group count and
    module refcount from delete_and_unsubscribe_port() looks racy; it's
    not covered by the group list lock, and it's likely a cause of the
    reported unbalance at port deletion.  Let's move the call inside the
    group list_mutex to plug the hole.

    drm: don't block fb changes for async plane updates
    
    commit 89a4aac0ab0e6f5eea10d7bf4869dd15c3de2cd4 upstream.
    
    In the case of a normal sync update, the preparation of framebuffers (be
    it calling drm_atomic_helper_prepare_planes() or doing setups with
    drm_framebuffer_get()) are performed in the new_state and the respective
    cleanups are performed in the old_state.
    
    In the case of async updates, the preparation is also done in the
    new_state but the cleanups are done in the new_state (because updates
    are performed in place, i.e. in the current state).
    
    The current code blocks async udpates when the fb is changed, turning
    async updates into sync updates, slowing down cursor updates and
    introducing regressions in igt tests with errors of type:
    
    "CRITICAL: completed 97 cursor updated in a period of 30 flips, we
    expect to complete approximately 15360 updates, with the threshold set
    at 7680"
    
    Fb changes in async updates were prevented to avoid the following scenario:
    
    - Async update, oldfb = NULL, newfb = fb1, prepare fb1, cleanup fb1
    - Async update, oldfb = fb1, newfb = fb2, prepare fb2, cleanup fb2
    - Non-async commit, oldfb = fb2, newfb = fb1, prepare fb1, cleanup fb2 (wrong)
    Where we have a single call to prepare fb2 but double cleanup call to fb2.
    
    To solve the above problems, instead of blocking async fb changes, we
    place the old framebuffer in the new_state object, so when the code
    performs cleanups in the new_state it will cleanup the old_fb and we
    will have the following scenario instead:
    
    - Async update, oldfb = NULL, newfb = fb1, prepare fb1, no cleanup
    - Async update, oldfb = fb1, newfb = fb2, prepare fb2, cleanup fb1
    - Non-async commit, oldfb = fb2, newfb = fb1, prepare fb1, cleanup fb2
    
    Where calls to prepare/cleanup are balanced.

            Commit 1e07d63749 ("drm/nouveau: add kconfig option to turn off nouveau
            legacy contexts. (v3)") has caused a build failure for me when I

            Upstream does not have that problem, as commit bed2dd8421 ("drm/ttm:

            drm_legacy_mmap from nouveau_ttm.c.  Unfortunately that commit does not
            apply in 5.1.9.
    
    The ensuing discussion proposed a number of one-off patches, but no
    solid agreement was made, so just revert the commit for now to get
    people's systems building again.

    percpu: do not search past bitmap when allocating an area
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c43004af01635cc9fbb11031d070e5e0d327ef2 ]
    
    pcpu_find_block_fit() guarantees that a fit is found within
    PCPU_BITMAP_BLOCK_BITS. Iteration is used to determine the first fit as
    it compares against the block's contig_hint. This can lead to
    incorrectly scanning past the end of the bitmap. The behavior was okay
    given the check after for bit_off >= end and the correctness of the
    hints from pcpu_find_block_fit().
    
    This patch fixes this by bounding the end offset by the number of bits
    in a chunk.

    Undefined instruction is triggered during CP14 reset, because bits: #16

    and SPIDEN lines, which are provided by Secure JTAG hardware block. That
    block in turn is powered from cluster 0 (big/Eagle), but the Exynos5422
    boots on cluster 1 (LITTLE/KFC).
    
    To fix this issue it is enough to turn on the power on the cluster 0 for
    a while. This lets the Secure JTAG block to propagate the needed signals
    to LITTLE/KFC cores and change their DSCR.

    This patch fixes deadlock warning if removing PWM device
    when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled.
    
    This issue can be reproceduced by the following steps on
    the R-Car H3 Salvator-X board if the backlight is disabled:
    
     # cd /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0
     # echo 0 > export
     # ls
     device  export  npwm  power  pwm0  subsystem  uevent  unexport
     # cd device/driver
     # ls
     bind  e6e31000.pwm  uevent  unbind
     # echo e6e31000.pwm > unbind

    The sysfs unexport in pwmchip_remove() is completely asymmetric
    to what we do in pwmchip_add_with_polarity() and commit 0733424c9ba9
    ("pwm: Unexport children before chip removal") is a strong indication
    that this was wrong to begin with. We should just move
    pwmchip_sysfs_unexport() where it belongs, which is right after
    pwmchip_sysfs_unexport_children(). In that case, we do not need
    separate functions anymore either.
    
    We also really want to remove sysfs irrespective of whether or not
    the chip will be removed as a result of pwmchip_remove(). We can only
    assume that the driver will be gone after that, so we shouldn't leave
    any dangling sysfs files around.
    
    This warning disappears if we move pwmchip_sysfs_unexport() to
    the top of pwmchip_remove(), pwmchip_sysfs_unexport_children().
    That way it is also outside of the pwm_lock section, which indeed
    doesn't seem to be needed.
    
    Moving the pwmchip_sysfs_export() call outside of that section also
    seems fine and it'd be perfectly symmetric with pwmchip_remove() again.
    
    So, this patch fixes them.

    ARM: dts: exynos: Always enable necessary APIO_1V8 and ABB_1V8 regulators on Arndale Octa
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ab99cf7d5e96e3b727c30e7a8524c976bd3723d ]
    
    The PVDD_APIO_1V8 (LDO2) and PVDD_ABB_1V8 (LDO8) regulators were turned
    off by Linux kernel as unused.  However they supply critical parts of
    SoC so they should be always on:
    
    1. PVDD_APIO_1V8 supplies SYS pins (gpx[0-3], PSHOLD), HDMI level shift,
       RTC, VDD1_12 (DRAM internal 1.8 V logic), pull-up for PMIC interrupt
       lines, TTL/UARTR level shift, reset pins and SW-TACT1 button.
       It also supplies unused blocks like VDDQ_SRAM (for SROM controller) and
       VDDQ_GPIO (gpm7, gpy7).
       The LDO2 cannot be turned off (S2MPS11 keeps it on anyway) so
       marking it "always-on" only reflects its real status.
    
    2. PVDD_ABB_1V8 supplies Adaptive Body Bias Generator for ARM cores,
       memory and Mali (G3D).

    pwm: tiehrpwm: Update shadow register for disabling PWMs
    
    [ Upstream commit b00ef53053191d3025c15e8041699f8c9d132daf ]
    
    It must be made sure that immediate mode is not already set, when
    modifying shadow register value in ehrpwm_pwm_disable(). Otherwise
    modifications to the action-qualifier continuous S/W force
    register(AQSFRC) will be done in the active register.
    This may happen when both channels are being disabled. In this case,
    only the first channel state will be recorded as disabled in the shadow
    register. Later, when enabling the first channel again, the second
    channel would be enabled as well. Setting RLDCSF to zero, first, ensures
    that the shadow register is updated as desired.

    dmaengine: idma64: Use actual device for DMA transfers
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ba846b1ee0792f5a596b9b0b86d6e8cdebfab06 ]
    
    Intel IOMMU, when enabled, tries to find the domain of the device,
    assuming it's a PCI one, during DMA operations, such as mapping or
    unmapping. Since we are splitting the actual PCI device to couple of
    children via MFD framework (see drivers/mfd/intel-lpss.c for details),
    the DMA device appears to be a platform one, and thus not an actual one
    that performs DMA. In a such situation IOMMU can't find or allocate
    a proper domain for its operations. As a result, all DMA operations are
    failed.
    
    In order to fix this, supply parent of the platform device
    to the DMA engine framework and fix filter functions accordingly.
    
    We may rely on the fact that parent is a real PCI device, because no
    other configuration is present in the wild.

    gpio: gpio-omap: add check for off wake capable gpios

    We are currently assuming all GPIOs are non-wakeup capable GPIOs as we

    Let's add omap_gpio_is_off_wakeup_capable() to make the handling clearer
    while considering that later patches may want to configure SoC specific
    bank->non_wakeup_gpios for the GPIOs in wakeup domain.

    block, bfq: increase idling for weight-raised queues
    
    [ Upstream commit 778c02a236a8728bb992de10ed1f12c0be5b7b0e ]
    
    If a sync bfq_queue has a higher weight than some other queue, and
    remains temporarily empty while in service, then, to preserve the
    bandwidth share of the queue, it is necessary to plug I/O dispatching
    until a new request arrives for the queue. In addition, a timeout
    needs to be set, to avoid waiting for ever if the process associated
    with the queue has actually finished its I/O.
    
    Even with the above timeout, the device is however not fed with new
    I/O for a while, if the process has finished its I/O. If this happens
    often, then throughput drops and latencies grow. For this reason, the
    timeout is kept rather low: 8 ms is the current default.
    
    Unfortunately, such a low value may cause, on the opposite end, a
    violation of bandwidth guarantees for a process that happens to issue
    new I/O too late. The higher the system load, the higher the
    probability that this happens to some process. This is a problem in
    scenarios where service guarantees matter more than throughput. One
    important case are weight-raised queues, which need to be granted a
    very high fraction of the bandwidth.
    
    To address this issue, this commit lower-bounds the plugging timeout
    for weight-raised queues to 20 ms. This simple change provides
    relevant benefits. For example, on a PLEXTOR PX-256M5S, with which
    gnome-terminal starts in 0.6 seconds if there is no other I/O in
    progress, the same applications starts in
    - 0.8 seconds, instead of 1.2 seconds, if ten files are being read
      sequentially in parallel
    - 1 second, instead of 2 seconds, if, in parallel, five files are
      being read sequentially, and five more files are being written
      sequentially

    PCI: rcar: Fix 64bit MSI message address handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 954b4b752a4c4e963b017ed8cef4c453c5ed308d ]
    
    The MSI message address in the RC address space can be 64 bit. The
    R-Car PCIe RC supports such a 64bit MSI message address as well.
    The code currently uses virt_to_phys(__get_free_pages()) to obtain
    a reserved page for the MSI message address, and the return value
    of which can be a 64 bit physical address on 64 bit system.
    
    However, the driver only programs PCIEMSIALR register with the bottom
    32 bits of the virt_to_phys(__get_free_pages()) return value and does
    not program the top 32 bits into PCIEMSIAUR, but rather programs the
    PCIEMSIAUR register with 0x0. This worked fine on older 32 bit R-Car
    SoCs, however may fail on new 64 bit R-Car SoCs.
    
    Since from a PCIe controller perspective, an inbound MSI is a memory
    write to a special address (in case of this controller, defined by
    the value in PCIEMSIAUR:PCIEMSIALR), which triggers an interrupt, but
    never hits the DRAM _and_ because allocation of an MSI by a PCIe card
    driver obtains the MSI message address by reading PCIEMSIAUR:PCIEMSIALR
    in rcar_msi_setup_irqs(), incorrectly programmed PCIEMSIAUR cannot
    cause memory corruption or other issues.
    
    There is however the possibility that if virt_to_phys(__get_free_pages())
    returned address above the 32bit boundary _and_ PCIEMSIAUR was programmed
    to 0x0 _and_ if the system had physical RAM at the address matching the
    value of PCIEMSIALR, a PCIe card driver could allocate a buffer with a
    physical address matching the value of PCIEMSIALR and a remote write to
    such a buffer by a PCIe card would trigger a spurious MSI.

    platform/x86: intel_pmc_ipc: adding error handling
    
    [ Upstream commit e61985d0550df8c2078310202aaad9b41049c36c ]
    
    If punit or telemetry device initialization fails, pmc driver should
    unregister and return failure.
    
    This change is to fix a kernel panic when removing kernel module
    intel_pmc_ipc.

    PCI: rpadlpar: Fix leaked device_node references in add/remove paths
    
    [ Upstream commit fb26228bfc4ce3951544848555c0278e2832e618 ]
    
    The find_dlpar_node() helper returns a device node with its reference
    incremented.  Both the add and remove paths use this helper for find the
    appropriate node, but fail to release the reference when done.
    
    Annotate the find_dlpar_node() helper with a comment about the incremented
    reference count and call of_node_put() on the obtained device_node in the
    add and remove paths.  Also, fixup a reference leak in the find_vio_slot()
    helper where we fail to call of_node_put() on the vdevice node after we
    iterate over its children.

    ARM: dts: imx6qdl: Specify IMX6QDL_CLK_IPG as "ipg" clock to SDMA

    soc: rockchip: Set the proper PWM for rk3288
    
    [ Upstream commit bbdc00a7de24cc90315b1775fb74841373fe12f7 ]
    
    The rk3288 SoC has two PWM implementations available, the "old"
    implementation and the "new" one.  You can switch between the two of
    them by flipping a bit in the grf.
    
    The "old" implementation is the default at chip power up but isn't the
    one that's officially supposed to be used.  ...and, in fact, the
    driver that gets selected in Linux using the rk3288 device tree only
    supports the "new" implementation.
    
    Long ago I tried to get a switch to the right IP block landed in the
    PWM driver (search for "rk3288: Switch to use the proper PWM IP") but
    that got rejected.  In the mean time the grf has grown a full-fledged
    driver that already sets other random bits like this.  That means we
    can now get the fix landed.
    
    For those wondering how things could have possibly worked for the last
    4.5 years, folks have mostly been relying on the bootloader to set
    this bit.  ...but occasionally folks have pointed back to my old patch
    series [1] in downstream kernels.

    clk: rockchip: Turn on "aclk_dmac1" for suspend on rk3288
    
    [ Upstream commit 57a20248ef3e429dc822f0774bc4e00136c46c83 ]
    
    Experimentally it can be seen that going into deep sleep (specifically
    setting PMU_CLR_DMA and PMU_CLR_BUS in RK3288_PMU_PWRMODE_CON1)
    appears to fail unless "aclk_dmac1" is on.  The failure is that the
    system never signals that it made it into suspend on the GLOBAL_PWROFF
    pin and it just hangs.
    
    NOTE that it's confirmed that it's the actual suspend that fails, not
    one of the earlier calls to read/write registers.  Specifically if you
    comment out the "PMU_GLOBAL_INT_DISABLE" setting in
    rk3288_slp_mode_set() and then comment out the "cpu_do_idle()" call in
    rockchip_lpmode_enter() then you can exercise the whole suspend path
    without any crashing.
    
    This is currently not a problem with suspend upstream because there is
    no current way to exercise the deep suspend code.  However, anyone
    trying to make it work will run into this issue.
    
    This was not a problem on shipping rk3288-based Chromebooks because
    those devices all ran on an old kernel based on 3.14.  On that kernel
    "aclk_dmac1" appears to be left on all the time.
    
    There are several ways to skin this problem.
    
    A) We could add "aclk_dmac1" to the list of critical clocks and that
    apperas to work, but presumably that wastes power.
    
    B) We could keep a list of "struct clk" objects to enable at suspend
    time in clk-rk3288.c and use the standard clock APIs.
    
    C) We could make the rk3288-pmu driver keep a list of clocks to enable
    at suspend time.  Presumably this would require a dts and bindings
    change.
    
    D) We could just whack the clock on in the existing syscore suspend
    function where we whack a bunch of other clocks.  This is particularly
    easy because we know for sure that the clock's only parent
    ("aclk_cpu") is a critical clock so we don't need to do anything more
    than ungate it.
    
    In this case I have chosen D) because it seemed like the least work,
    but any of the other options would presumably also work fine.

    PCI: keystone: Prevent ARM32 specific code to be compiled for ARM64
    
    [ Upstream commit f316a2b53cd7f37963ae20ec7072eb27a349a4ce ]
    
    hook_fault_code() is an ARM32 specific API for hooking into data abort.
    
    AM65X platforms (that integrate ARM v8 cores and select CONFIG_ARM64 as
    arch) rely on pci-keystone.c but on them the enumeration of a
    non-present BDF does not trigger a bus error, so the fixup exception
    provided by calling hook_fault_code() is not needed and can be guarded
    with CONFIG_ARM.

    [ Upstream commit 94d4e7af14a1170e34cf082d92e4c02de9e9fb88 ]
    
    As new transfer mechanisms are added to the EC codebase, they may
    not support v2 of the EC protocol.
    
    If the v3 initial handshake transfer fails, the kernel will try
    and call cmd_xfer as a fallback. If v2 is not supported, cmd_xfer
    will be NULL, and the code will end up causing a kernel panic.
    
    Add a check for NULL before calling the transfer function, along
    with a helpful comment explaining how one might end up in this
    situation.

    found through pirq_find_routing_table().  If the table is not found and
    CONFIG_PCI_BIOS is defined, the table is then allocated in
    pcibios_get_irq_routing_table() using kmalloc().  Later, if the I/O APIC is
    used, this table is actually not used.  In that case, the allocated table
    is not freed, which is a memory leak.
    
    Free the allocated table if it is not used.

    vfio: Fix WARNING "do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING"
    
    [ Upstream commit 41be3e2618174fdf3361e49e64f2bf530f40c6b0 ]
    
    vfio_dev_present() which is the condition to
    wait_event_interruptible_timeout(), will call vfio_group_get_device
    and try to acquire the mutex group->device_lock.
    
    wait_event_interruptible_timeout() will set the state of the current
    task to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, before doing the condition check. This
    means that we will try to acquire the mutex while already in a
    sleeping state. The scheduler warns us by giving the following

    nfsd: allow fh_want_write to be called twice
    
    [ Upstream commit 0b8f62625dc309651d0efcb6a6247c933acd8b45 ]
    
    A fuzzer recently triggered lockdep warnings about potential sb_writers
    deadlocks caused by fh_want_write().
    
    Looks like we aren't careful to pair each fh_want_write() with an
    fh_drop_write().
    
    It's not normally a problem since fh_put() will call fh_drop_write() for
    us.  And was OK for NFSv3 where we'd do one operation that might call
    fh_want_write(), and then put the filehandle.
    
    But an NFSv4 protocol fuzzer can do weird things like call unlink twice
    in a compound, and then we get into trouble.
    
    I'm a little worried about this approach of just leaving everything to
    fh_put().  But I think there are probably a lot of
    fh_want_write()/fh_drop_write() imbalances so for now I think we need it
    to be more forgiving.

    fuse: retrieve: cap requested size to negotiated max_write
    
    [ Upstream commit 7640682e67b33cab8628729afec8ca92b851394f ]
    
    FUSE filesystem server and kernel client negotiate during initialization
    phase, what should be the maximum write size the client will ever issue.
    Correspondingly the filesystem server then queues sys_read calls to read
    requests with buffer capacity large enough to carry request header + that
    max_write bytes. A filesystem server is free to set its max_write in
    anywhere in the range between [1*page, fc->max_pages*page]. In particular
    go-fuse[2] sets max_write by default as 64K, wheres default fc->max_pages
    corresponds to 128K. Libfuse also allows users to configure max_write, but
    by default presets it to possible maximum.
    
    If max_write is < fc->max_pages*page, and in NOTIFY_RETRIEVE handler we
    allow to retrieve more than max_write bytes, corresponding prepared
    NOTIFY_REPLY will be thrown away by fuse_dev_do_read, because the
    filesystem server, in full correspondence with server/client contract, will
    be only queuing sys_read with ~max_write buffer capacity, and
    fuse_dev_do_read throws away requests that cannot fit into server request
    buffer. In turn the filesystem server could get stuck waiting indefinitely
    for NOTIFY_REPLY since NOTIFY_RETRIEVE handler returned OK which is
    understood by clients as that NOTIFY_REPLY was queued and will be sent
    back.
    
    Cap requested size to negotiate max_write to avoid the problem.  This
    aligns with the way NOTIFY_RETRIEVE handler works, which already
    unconditionally caps requested retrieve size to fuse_conn->max_pages.  This
    way it should not hurt NOTIFY_RETRIEVE semantic if we return less data than
    was originally requested.
    
    Please see [1] for context where the problem of stuck filesystem was hit
    for real, how the situation was traced and for more involving patch that
    did not make it into the tree.

    When the bit_offset in the cell is zero, the pointer to the msb will
    not be properly initialized (ie, will still be pointing to the first
    byte in the buffer).
    
    This being the case, if there are bits to clear in the msb, those will
    be left untouched while the mask will incorrectly clear bit positions
    on the first byte.
    
    This commit also makes sure that any byte unused in the cell is

    ALSA: hda - Register irq handler after the chip initialization
    
    [ Upstream commit f495222e28275222ab6fd93813bd3d462e16d340 ]
    
    Currently the IRQ handler in HD-audio controller driver is registered
    before the chip initialization.  That is, we have some window opened
    between the azx_acquire_irq() call and the CORB/RIRB setup.  If an
    interrupt is triggered in this small window, the IRQ handler may
    access to the uninitialized RIRB buffer, which leads to a NULL
    dereference Oops.
    
    This is usually no big problem since most of Intel chips do register
    the IRQ via MSI, and we've already fixed the order of the IRQ
    enablement and the CORB/RIRB setup in the former commit b61749a89f82
    ("sound: enable interrupt after dma buffer initialization"), hence the
    IRQ won't be triggered in that room.  However, some platforms use a
    shared IRQ, and this may allow the IRQ trigger by another source.
    
    Another possibility is the kdump environment: a stale interrupt might
    be present in there, the IRQ handler can be falsely triggered as well.
    
    For covering this small race, let's move the azx_acquire_irq() call
    after hda_intel_init_chip() call.  Although this is a bit radical
    change, it can cover more widely than checking the CORB/RIRB setup
    locally in the callee side.

    With holding queue's kobject refcount, it is safe for driver
    to schedule requeue. However, blk_mq_kick_requeue_list() may
    be called after blk_sync_queue() is done because of concurrent
    requeue activities, then requeue work may not be completed when
    freeing queue, and kernel oops is triggered.
    
    So moving the cancel of requeue_work into blk_mq_release() for
    avoiding race between requeue and freeing queue.

    mmc: mmci: Prevent polling for busy detection in IRQ context

    The IRQ handler, mmci_irq(), loops until all status bits have been cleared.
    However, the status bit signaling busy in variant->busy_detect_flag, may be
    set even if busy detection isn't monitored for the current request.
    
    This may be the case for the CMD11 when switching the I/O voltage, which
    leads to that mmci_irq() busy loops in IRQ context. Fix this problem, by
    clearing the status bit for busy, before continuing to validate the
    condition for the loop. This is safe, because the busy status detection has
    already been taken care of by mmci_cmd_irq().

    percpu: remove spurious lock dependency between percpu and sched
    
    [ Upstream commit 198790d9a3aeaef5792d33a560020861126edc22 ]
    
    In free_percpu() we sometimes call pcpu_schedule_balance_work() to
    queue a work item (which does a wakeup) while holding pcpu_lock.
    This creates an unnecessary lock dependency between pcpu_lock and
    the scheduler's pi_lock.  There are other places where we call
    pcpu_schedule_balance_work() without hold pcpu_lock, and this case
    doesn't need to be different.
    
    Moving the call outside the lock prevents the following lockdep splat
    when running tools/testing/selftests/bpf/{test_maps,test_progs} in
    sequence with lockdep enabled:

    sit.vblocks and sum valid block count in sit.valid_map may be
    inconsistent, segment w/ zero vblocks will be treated as free
    segment, while allocating in free segment, we may allocate a
    free block, if its bitmap is valid previously, it can cause
    kernel crash due to bitmap verification failure.
    
    Anyway, to avoid further serious metadata inconsistence and
    corruption, it is necessary and worth to detect SIT
    inconsistence. So let's enable check_block_count() to verify
    vblocks and valid_map all the time rather than do it only
    CONFIG_F2FS_CHECK_FS is enabled.

    ntp: Allow TAI-UTC offset to be set to zero
    
    [ Upstream commit fdc6bae940ee9eb869e493990540098b8c0fd6ab ]
    
    The ADJ_TAI adjtimex mode sets the TAI-UTC offset of the system clock.
    It is typically set by NTP/PTP implementations and it is automatically
    updated by the kernel on leap seconds. The initial value is zero (which
    applications may interpret as unknown), but this value cannot be set by
    adjtimex. This limitation seems to go back to the original "nanokernel"
    implementation by David Mills.
    
    Change the ADJ_TAI check to accept zero as a valid TAI-UTC offset in
    order to allow setting it back to the initial value.

    pwm: meson: Use the spin-lock only to protect register modifications
    
    [ Upstream commit f173747fffdf037c791405ab4f1ec0eb392fc48e ]
    
    Holding the spin-lock for all of the code in meson_pwm_apply() can
    result in a "BUG: scheduling while atomic". This can happen because
    clk_get_rate() (which is called from meson_pwm_calc()) may sleep.
    Only hold the spin-lock when modifying registers to solve this.
    
    The reason why we need a spin-lock in the driver is because the
    REG_MISC_AB register is shared between the two channels provided by one
    PWM controller. The only functions where REG_MISC_AB is modified are
    meson_pwm_enable() and meson_pwm_disable() so the register reads/writes
    in there need to be protected by the spin-lock.
    
    The original code also used the spin-lock to protect the values in
    struct meson_pwm_channel. This could be necessary if two consumers can
    use the same PWM channel. However, PWM core doesn't allow this so we
    don't need to protect the values in struct meson_pwm_channel with a
    lock.

    EDAC/mpc85xx: Prevent building as a module
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b8358a951b1e2a534a54924cd8245e58a1c5fb8 ]
    
    The mpc85xx EDAC driver can be configured as a module but then fails to
    build because it uses two unexported symbols:
    
      ERROR: ".pci_find_hose_for_OF_device" [drivers/edac/mpc85xx_edac_mod.ko] undefined!
      ERROR: ".early_find_capability" [drivers/edac/mpc85xx_edac_mod.ko] undefined!
    
    We don't want to export those symbols just for this driver, so make the
    driver only configurable as a built-in.
    
    This seems to have been broken since at least
    
      c92132f59806 ("edac/85xx: Add PCIe error interrupt edac support")
    
    (Nov 2013).

    objtool: Don't use ignore flag for fake jumps
    
    [ Upstream commit e6da9567959e164f82bc81967e0d5b10dee870b4 ]
    
    The ignore flag is set on fake jumps in order to keep
    add_jump_destinations() from setting their jump_dest, since it already
    got set when the fake jump was created.
    
    But using the ignore flag is a bit of a hack.  It's normally used to
    skip validation of an instruction, which doesn't really make sense for
    fake jumps.
    
    Also, after the next patch, using the ignore flag for fake jumps can
    trigger a false "why am I validating an ignored function?" warning.
    
    Instead just add an explicit check in add_jump_destinations() to skip
    fake jumps.

    drm/bridge: adv7511: Fix low refresh rate selection
    
    [ Upstream commit 67793bd3b3948dc8c8384b6430e036a30a0ecb43 ]
    
    The driver currently sets register 0xfb (Low Refresh Rate) based on the
    value of mode->vrefresh. Firstly, this field is specified to be in Hz,
    but the magic numbers used by the code are Hz * 1000. This essentially
    leads to the low refresh rate always being set to 0x01, since the
    vrefresh value will always be less than 24000. Fix the magic numbers to
    be in Hz.
    Secondly, according to the comment in drm_modes.h, the field is not
    supposed to be used in a functional way anyway. Instead, use the helper
    function drm_mode_vrefresh().

    perf/x86/intel: Allow PEBS multi-entry in watermark mode
    
    [ Upstream commit c7a286577d7592720c2f179aadfb325a1ff48c95 ]
    
    This patch fixes a restriction/bug introduced by:
    
       583feb08e7f7 ("perf/x86/intel: Fix handling of wakeup_events for multi-entry PEBS")
    
    The original patch prevented using multi-entry PEBS when wakeup_events != 0.
    However given that wakeup_events is part of a union with wakeup_watermark, it
    means that in watermark mode, PEBS multi-entry is also disabled which is not the
    intent. This patch fixes this by checking is watermark mode is enabled.

    mfd: twl6040: Fix device init errors for ACCCTL register
    
    [ Upstream commit 48171d0ea7caccf21c9ee3ae75eb370f2a756062 ]
    
    I noticed that we can get a -EREMOTEIO errors on at least omap4 duovero:
    
    twl6040 0-004b: Failed to write 2d = 19: -121
    
    And then any following register access will produce errors.
    
    There 2d offset above is register ACCCTL that gets written on twl6040
    powerup. With error checking added to the related regcache_sync() call,
    the -EREMOTEIO error is reproducable on twl6040 powerup at least
    duovero.
    
    To fix the error, we need to wait until twl6040 is accessible after the
    powerup. Based on tests on omap4 duovero, we need to wait over 8ms after
    powerup before register write will complete without failures. Let's also
    make sure we warn about possible errors too.
    
    Note that we have twl6040_patch[] reg_sequence with the ACCCTL register
    configuration and regcache_sync() will write the new value to ACCCTL.

    drivers: thermal: tsens: Don't print error message on -EPROBE_DEFER
    
    [ Upstream commit fc7d18cf6a923cde7f5e7ba2c1105bb106d3e29a ]
    
    We print a calibration failure message on -EPROBE_DEFER from
    nvmem/qfprom as follows:
    [    3.003090] qcom-tsens 4a9000.thermal-sensor: version: 1.4

    This confuses people when, in fact, calibration succeeds later when
    nvmem/qfprom device is available. Don't print this message on a
    -EPROBE_DEFER.

    Currently IRQ remains enabled after .remove, later if device is probed,
    IRQ is requested before .thermal_init, this may cause IRQ function be
    called before device is initialized.
    
    this patch disables interrupt in .remove, to ensure irq function
    only be called after device is fully initialized.

    kernel/sys.c: prctl: fix false positive in validate_prctl_map()
    
    [ Upstream commit a9e73998f9d705c94a8dca9687633adc0f24a19a ]
    
    While validating new map we require the @start_data to be strictly less
    than @end_data, which is fine for regular applications (this is why this
    nit didn't trigger for that long).  These members are set from executable
    loaders such as elf handers, still it is pretty valid to have a loadable
    data section with zero size in file, in such case the start_data is equal
    to end_data once kernel loader finishes.
    
    As a result when we're trying to restore such programs the procedure fails
    and the kernel returns -EINVAL.  From the image dump of a program:
    
     | "mm_start_code": "0x400000",
     | "mm_end_code": "0x8f5fb4",
     | "mm_start_data": "0xf1bfb0",
     | "mm_end_data": "0xf1bfb0",
    
    Thus we need to change validate_prctl_map from strictly less to less or
    equal operator use.

    mm/slab.c: fix an infinite loop in leaks_show()
    
    [ Upstream commit 745e10146c31b1c6ed3326286704ae251b17f663 ]
    
    "cat /proc/slab_allocators" could hang forever on SMP machines with
    kmemleak or object debugging enabled due to other CPUs running do_drain()
    will keep making kmemleak_object or debug_objects_cache dirty and unable
    to escape the first loop in leaks_show(),
    
    do {
            set_store_user_clean(cachep);
            drain_cpu_caches(cachep);
            ...
    
    } while (!is_store_user_clean(cachep));
    
    For example,
    
    do_drain
      slabs_destroy
        slab_destroy
          kmem_cache_free
            __cache_free
              ___cache_free
                kmemleak_free_recursive
                  delete_object_full
                    __delete_object
                      put_object
                        free_object_rcu
                          kmem_cache_free
                            cache_free_debugcheck --> dirty kmemleak_object
    
    One approach is to check cachep->name and skip both kmemleak_object and
    debug_objects_cache in leaks_show().  The other is to set store_user_clean
    after drain_cpu_caches() which leaves a small window between
    drain_cpu_caches() and set_store_user_clean() where per-CPU caches could
    be dirty again lead to slightly wrong information has been stored but
    could also speed up things significantly which sounds like a good
    compromise.  For example,
    
     # cat /proc/slab_allocators
     0m42.778s # 1st approach
     0m0.737s  # 2nd approach

    mm/cma_debug.c: fix the break condition in cma_maxchunk_get()

    If not find zero bit in find_next_zero_bit(), it will return the size
    parameter passed in, so the start bit should be compared with bitmap_maxno
    rather than cma->count.  Although getting maxchunk is working fine due to
    zero value of order_per_bit currently, the operation will be stuck if
    order_per_bit is set as non-zero.

    mm/cma.c: fix the bitmap status to show failed allocation reason
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b59e01a3aa665f751d1410b99fae9336bd424e1 ]
    
    Currently one bit in cma bitmap represents number of pages rather than
    one page, cma->count means cma size in pages. So to find available pages
    via find_next_zero_bit()/find_next_bit() we should use cma size not in
    pages but in bits although current free pages number is correct due to
    zero value of order_per_bit. Once order_per_bit is changed the bitmap
    status will be incorrect.
    
    The size input in cma_debug_show_areas() is not correct.  It will
    affect the available pages at some position to debug the failure issue.
    
    This is an example with order_per_bit = 1
    
    Before this change:
    [    4.120060] cma: number of available pages: 1@93+4@108+7@121+7@137+7@153+7@169+7@185+7@201+3@213+3@221+3@229+3@237+3@245+3@253+3@261+3@269+3@277+3@285+3@293+3@301+3@309+3@317+3@325+19@333+15@369+512@512=> 638 free of 1024 total pages
    
    After this change:
    [    4.143234] cma: number of available pages: 2@93+8@108+14@121+14@137+14@153+14@169+14@185+14@201+6@213+6@221+6@229+6@237+6@245+6@253+6@261+6@269+6@277+6@285+6@293+6@301+6@309+6@317+6@325+38@333+30@369=> 252 free of 1024 total pages
    
    Obviously the bitmap status before is incorrect.

    mem-hotplug: fix node spanned pages when we have a node with only ZONE_MOVABLE
    
    [ Upstream commit 299c83dce9ea3a79bb4b5511d2cb996b6b8e5111 ]
    
    342332e6a925 ("mm/page_alloc.c: introduce kernelcore=mirror option") and
    later patches rewrote the calculation of node spanned pages.
    
    e506b99696a2 ("mem-hotplug: fix node spanned pages when we have a movable
    node"), but the current code still has problems,
    
    When we have a node with only zone_movable and the node id is not zero,
    the size of node spanned pages is double added.
    
    That's because we have an empty normal zone, and zone_start_pfn or
    zone_end_pfn is not between arch_zone_lowest_possible_pfn and
    arch_zone_highest_possible_pfn, so we need to use clamp to constrain the
    range just like the commit <96e907d13602> (bootmem: Reimplement
    __absent_pages_in_range() using for_each_mem_pfn_range()).
    
    e.g.
    Zone ranges:
      DMA      [mem 0x0000000000001000-0x0000000000ffffff]
      DMA32    [mem 0x0000000001000000-0x00000000ffffffff]
      Normal   [mem 0x0000000100000000-0x000000023fffffff]
    Movable zone start for each node
      Node 0: 0x0000000100000000
      Node 1: 0x0000000140000000
    Early memory node ranges
      node   0: [mem 0x0000000000001000-0x000000000009efff]
      node   0: [mem 0x0000000000100000-0x00000000bffdffff]
      node   0: [mem 0x0000000100000000-0x000000013fffffff]
      node   1: [mem 0x0000000140000000-0x000000023fffffff]

    It shows that the current memory of node 1 is double added.
    After this patch, the problem is fixed.

    hugetlbfs: on restore reserve error path retain subpool reservation
    
    [ Upstream commit 0919e1b69ab459e06df45d3ba6658d281962db80 ]
    
    When a huge page is allocated, PagePrivate() is set if the allocation
    consumed a reservation.  When freeing a huge page, PagePrivate is checked.
    If set, it indicates the reservation should be restored.  PagePrivate
    being set at free huge page time mostly happens on error paths.
    
    When huge page reservations are created, a check is made to determine if
    the mapping is associated with an explicitly mounted filesystem.  If so,
    pages are also reserved within the filesystem.  The default action when
    freeing a huge page is to decrement the usage count in any associated
    explicitly mounted filesystem.  However, if the reservation is to be
    restored the reservation/use count within the filesystem should not be
    decrementd.  Otherwise, a subsequent page allocation and free for the same
    mapping location will cause the file filesystem usage to go 'negative'.
    
    Filesystem                         Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    nodev                              4.0G -4.0M  4.1G    - /opt/hugepool
    
    To fix, when freeing a huge page do not adjust filesystem usage if
    PagePrivate() is set to indicate the reservation should be restored.
    
    I did not cc stable as the problem has been around since reserves were
    added to hugetlbfs and nobody has noticed.

    ARM: prevent tracing IPI_CPU_BACKTRACE
    
    [ Upstream commit be167862ae7dd85c56d385209a4890678e1b0488 ]
    
    Patch series "compiler: allow all arches to enable
    CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING", v3.
    
    This patch (of 11):
    
    When function tracing for IPIs is enabled, we get a warning for an
    overflow of the ipi_types array with the IPI_CPU_BACKTRACE type as
    triggered by raise_nmi():
    
      arch/arm/kernel/smp.c: In function 'raise_nmi':
      arch/arm/kernel/smp.c:489:2: error: array subscript is above array bounds [-Werror=array-bounds]
        trace_ipi_raise(target, ipi_types[ipinr]);
    
    This is a correct warning as we actually overflow the array here.
    
    This patch raise_nmi() to call __smp_cross_call() instead of
    smp_cross_call(), to avoid calling into ftrace.  For clarification, I'm
    also adding a two new code comments describing how this one is special.
    
    The warning appears to have shown up after commit e7273ff49acf ("ARM:
    8488/1: Make IPI_CPU_BACKTRACE a "non-secure" SGI"), which changed the
    number assignment from '15' to '8', but as far as I can tell has existed
    since the IPI tracepoints were first introduced.  If we decide to
    backport this patch to stable kernels, we probably need to backport
    e7273ff49acf as well.

    ipc: prevent lockup on alloc_msg and free_msg
    
    [ Upstream commit d6a2946a88f524a47cc9b79279667137899db807 ]
    
    msgctl10 of ltp triggers the following lockup When CONFIG_KASAN is
    enabled on large memory SMP systems, the pages initialization can take a
    long time, if msgctl10 requests a huge block memory, and it will block
    rcu scheduler, so release cpu actively.
    
    After adding schedule() in free_msg, free_msg can not be called when
    holding spinlock, so adding msg to a tmp list, and free it out of
    spinlock

    Davidlohr said:
     "So after releasing the lock, the msg rbtree/list is empty and new
      calls will not see those in the newly populated tmp_msg list, and
      therefore they cannot access the delayed msg freeing pointers, which
      is good. Also the fact that the node_cache is now freed before the
      actual messages seems to be harmless as this is wanted for
      msg_insert() avoiding GFP_ATOMIC allocations, and after releasing the
      info->lock the thing is freed anyway so it should not change things"

    sysctl: return -EINVAL if val violates minmax
    
    [ Upstream commit e260ad01f0aa9e96b5386d5cd7184afd949dc457 ]
    
    Currently when userspace gives us a values that overflow e.g.  file-max
    and other callers of __do_proc_doulongvec_minmax() we simply ignore the
    new value and leave the current value untouched.
    
    This can be problematic as it gives the illusion that the limit has
    indeed be bumped when in fact it failed.  This commit makes sure to
    return EINVAL when an overflow is detected.  Please note that this is a
    userspace facing change.

    fs/fat/file.c: issue flush after the writeback of FAT
    
    [ Upstream commit bd8309de0d60838eef6fb575b0c4c7e95841cf73 ]
    
    fsync() needs to make sure the data & meta-data of file are persistent
    after the return of fsync(), even when a power-failure occurs later.  In
    the case of fat-fs, the FAT belongs to the meta-data of file, so we need
    to issue a flush after the writeback of FAT instead before.
    
    Also bail out early when any stage of fsync fails.
