    commit 822bfa51ce44f2c63c300fdb76dc99c4d5a5ca9f upstream.
    
    "nframes" comes from the user and "nframes * CD_FRAMESIZE_RAW" can wrap
    on 32 bit systems.  That would have been ok if we used the same wrapped
    value for the copy, but we use a shifted value.  We should just use the
    checked version of copy_to_user() because it's not going to make a
    difference to the speed.

    epoll: limit paths
    
    commit 28d82dc1c4edbc352129f97f4ca22624d1fe61de upstream.
    
    The current epoll code can be tickled to run basically indefinitely in
    both loop detection path check (on ep_insert()), and in the wakeup paths.
    The programs that tickle this behavior set up deeply linked networks of
    epoll file descriptors that cause the epoll algorithms to traverse them
    indefinitely.  A couple of these sample programs have been previously
    posted in this thread: https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/2/25/297.
    
    To fix the loop detection path check algorithms, I simply keep track of
    the epoll nodes that have been already visited.  Thus, the loop detection
    becomes proportional to the number of epoll file descriptor and links.
    This dramatically decreases the run-time of the loop check algorithm.  In
    one diabolical case I tried it reduced the run-time from 15 mintues (all
    in kernel time) to .3 seconds.
    
    Fixing the wakeup paths could be done at wakeup time in a similar manner
    by keeping track of nodes that have already been visited, but the
    complexity is harder, since there can be multiple wakeups on different
    cpus...Thus, I've opted to limit the number of possible wakeup paths when
    the paths are created.
    
    This is accomplished, by noting that the end file descriptor points that
    are found during the loop detection pass (from the newly added link), are
    actually the sources for wakeup events.  I keep a list of these file
    descriptors and limit the number and length of these paths that emanate
    from these 'source file descriptors'.  In the current implemetation I
    allow 1000 paths of length 1, 500 of length 2, 100 of length 3, 50 of
    length 4 and 10 of length 5.  Note that it is sufficient to check the
    'source file descriptors' reachable from the newly added link, since no
    other 'source file descriptors' will have newly added links.  This allows
    us to check only the wakeup paths that may have gotten too long, and not
    re-check all possible wakeup paths on the system.
    
    In terms of the path limit selection, I think its first worth noting that
    the most common case for epoll, is probably the model where you have 1
    epoll file descriptor that is monitoring n number of 'source file
    descriptors'.  In this case, each 'source file descriptor' has a 1 path of
    length 1.  Thus, I believe that the limits I'm proposing are quite
    reasonable and in fact may be too generous.  Thus, I'm hoping that the
    proposed limits will not prevent any workloads that currently work to
    fail.
    
    In terms of locking, I have extended the use of the 'epmutex' to all
    epoll_ctl add and remove operations.  Currently its only used in a subset
    of the add paths.  I need to hold the epmutex, so that we can correctly
    traverse a coherent graph, to check the number of paths.  I believe that
    this additional locking is probably ok, since its in the setup/teardown
    paths, and doesn't affect the running paths, but it certainly is going to
    add some extra overhead.  Also, worth noting is that the epmuex was
    recently added to the ep_ctl add operations in the initial path loop
    detection code using the argument that it was not on a critical path.
    
    Another thing to note here, is the length of epoll chains that is allowed.
    Currently, eventpoll.c defines:
    
    /* Maximum number of nesting allowed inside epoll sets */
    #define EP_MAX_NESTS 4
    
    This basically means that I am limited to a graph depth of 5 (EP_MAX_NESTS
    + 1).  However, this limit is currently only enforced during the loop
    check detection code, and only when the epoll file descriptors are added
    in a certain order.  Thus, this limit is currently easily bypassed.  The
    newly added check for wakeup paths, stricly limits the wakeup paths to a
    length of 5, regardless of the order in which ep's are linked together.
    Thus, a side-effect of the new code is a more consistent enforcement of
    the graph depth.
    
    Thus far, I've tested this, using the sample programs previously
    mentioned, which now either return quickly or return -EINVAL.  I've also
    testing using the piptest.c epoll tester, which showed no difference in
    performance.  I've also created a number of different epoll networks and
    tested that they behave as expectded.
    
    I believe this solves the original diabolical test cases, while still
    preserving the sane epoll nesting.

    epoll: ep_unregister_pollwait() can use the freed pwq->whead
    
    commit 971316f0503a5c50633d07b83b6db2f15a3a5b00 upstream.
    
    signalfd_cleanup() ensures that ->signalfd_wqh is not used, but
    this is not enough. eppoll_entry->whead still points to the memory
    we are going to free, ep_unregister_pollwait()->remove_wait_queue()
    is obviously unsafe.
    
    Change ep_poll_callback(POLLFREE) to set eppoll_entry->whead = NULL,
    change ep_unregister_pollwait() to check pwq->whead != NULL under
    rcu_read_lock() before remove_wait_queue(). We add the new helper,
    ep_remove_wait_queue(), for this.
    
    This works because sighand_cachep is SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU and because
    ->signalfd_wqh is initialized in sighand_ctor(), not in copy_sighand.
    ep_unregister_pollwait()->remove_wait_queue() can play with already
    freed and potentially reused ->sighand, but this is fine. This memory
    must have the valid ->signalfd_wqh until rcu_read_unlock().

    epoll: introduce POLLFREE to flush ->signalfd_wqh before kfree()
    
    commit d80e731ecab420ddcb79ee9d0ac427acbc187b4b upstream.
    
    This patch is intentionally incomplete to simplify the review.
    It ignores ep_unregister_pollwait() which plays with the same wqh.
    See the next change.
    
    epoll assumes that the EPOLL_CTL_ADD'ed file controls everything
    f_op->poll() needs. In particular it assumes that the wait queue
    can't go away until eventpoll_release(). This is not true in case
    of signalfd, the task which does EPOLL_CTL_ADD uses its ->sighand
    which is not connected to the file.
    
    This patch adds the special event, POLLFREE, currently only for
    epoll. It expects that init_poll_funcptr()'ed hook should do the
    necessary cleanup. Perhaps it should be defined as EPOLLFREE in
    eventpoll.
    
    __cleanup_sighand() is changed to do wake_up_poll(POLLFREE) if
    ->signalfd_wqh is not empty, we add the new signalfd_cleanup()
    helper.
    
    ep_poll_callback(POLLFREE) simply does list_del_init(task_list).
    This make this poll entry inconsistent, but we don't care. If you
    share epoll fd which contains our sigfd with another process you
    should blame yourself. signalfd is "really special". I simply do
    not know how we can define the "right" semantics if it used with
    epoll.
    
    The main problem is, epoll calls signalfd_poll() once to establish
    the connection with the wait queue, after that signalfd_poll(NULL)
    returns the different/inconsistent results depending on who does
    EPOLL_CTL_MOD/signalfd_read/etc. IOW: apart from sigmask, signalfd
    has nothing to do with the file, it works with the current thread.
    
    In short: this patch is the hack which tries to fix the symptoms.
    It also assumes that nobody can take tasklist_lock under epoll
    locks, this seems to be true.
    
    Note:
    
            - we do not have wake_up_all_poll() but wake_up_poll()
              is fine, poll/epoll doesn't use WQ_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE.
    
            - signalfd_cleanup() uses POLLHUP along with POLLFREE,
              we need a couple of simple changes in eventpoll.c to
              make sure it can't be "lost".

    hwmon: (f75375s) Fix register write order when setting fans to full speed
    
    commit c1c1a3d012fe5e82a9a025fb4b5a4f8ee67a53f6 upstream.
    
    By hwmon sysfs interface convention, setting pwm_enable to zero sets a fan
    to full speed.  In the f75375s driver, this need be done by enabling
    manual fan control, plus duty mode for the F875387 chip, and then setting
    the maximum duty cycle.  Fix a bug where the two necessary register writes
    were swapped, effectively discarding the setting to full-speed.

    imon: don't wedge hardware after early callbacks
    
    commit 8791d63af0cf113725ae4cb8cba9492814c59a93 upstream.
    
    This patch is just a minor update to one titled "imon: Input from ffdc
    device type ignored" from Corinna Vinschen. An earlier patch to prevent
    an oops when we got early callbacks also has the nasty side-effect of
    wedging imon hardware, as we don't acknowledge the urb. Rework the check
    slightly here to bypass processing the packet, as the driver isn't yet
    fully initialized, but still acknowlege the urb and submit a new rx_urb.
    Do this for both interfaces -- irrelevant for ffdc hardware, but
    relevant for newer hardware, though newer hardware doesn't spew the
    constant stream of data as soon as the hardware is initialized like the
    older ffdc devices, so they'd be less likely to trigger this anyway...
    
    Tested with both an ffdc device and an 0042 device.

    davinci_emac: Do not free all rx dma descriptors during init
    
    commit 5d69703263d588dbb03f4e57091afd8942d96e6d upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a regression that was introduced by
    
    commit 0a5f38467765ee15478db90d81e40c269c8dda20
    davinci_emac: Add Carrier Link OK check in Davinci RX Handler
    
    Said commit adds a check whether the carrier link is ok. If the link is
    not ok, the skb is freed and no new dma descriptor added to the rx dma
    channel. This causes trouble during initialization when the carrier
    status has not yet been updated. If a lot of packets are received while
    netif_carrier_ok returns false, all dma descriptors are freed and the
    rx dma transfer is stopped.
    
    The bug occurs when the board is connected to a network with lots of
    traffic and the ifconfig down/up is done, e.g., when reconfiguring
    the interface with DHCP.
    
    The bug can be reproduced by flood pinging the davinci board while doing
    ifconfig eth0 down
    ifconfig eth0 up
    on the board.
    
    After that, the rx path stops working and the overrun value reported
    by ifconfig is counting up.
    
    This patch reverts commit 0a5f38467765ee15478db90d81e40c269c8dda20
    and instead issues warnings only if cpdma_chan_submit returns -ENOMEM.

    scsi_pm: Fix bug in the SCSI power management handler
    
    commit fea6d607e154cf96ab22254ccb48addfd43d4cb5 upstream.
    
    This patch (as1520) fixes a bug in the SCSI layer's power management
    implementation.
    
    LUN scanning can be carried out asynchronously in do_scan_async(), and
    sd uses an asynchronous thread for the time-consuming parts of disk
    probing in sd_probe_async().  Currently nothing coordinates these
    async threads with system sleep transitions; they can and do attempt
    to continue scanning/probing SCSI devices even after the host adapter
    has been suspended.  As one might expect, the outcome is not ideal.
    
    This is what the "prepare" stage of system suspend was created for.
    After the prepare callback has been called for a host, target, or
    device, drivers are not allowed to register any children underneath
    them.  Currently the SCSI prepare callback is not implemented; this
    patch rectifies that omission.
    
    For SCSI hosts, the prepare routine calls scsi_complete_async_scans()
    to wait until async scanning is finished.  It might be slightly more
    efficient to wait only until the host in question has been scanned,
    but there's currently no way to do that.  Besides, during a sleep
    transition we will ultimately have to wait until all the host scanning
    has finished anyway.
    
    For SCSI devices, the prepare routine calls async_synchronize_full()
    to wait until sd probing is finished.  The routine does nothing for
    SCSI targets, because asynchronous target scanning is done only as
    part of host scanning.

    scsi_scan: Fix 'Poison overwritten' warning caused by using freed 'shost'
    
    commit 267a6ad4aefaafbde607804c60945bcf97f91c1b upstream.
    
    In do_scan_async(), calling scsi_autopm_put_host(shost) may reference
    freed shost, and cause Posison overwitten warning.
    Yes, this case can happen, for example, an USB is disconnected just
    when do_scan_async() thread starts to run, then scsi_host_put() called
    in scsi_finish_async_scan() will lead to shost be freed(because the
    refcount of shost->shost_gendev decreases to 1 after USB disconnects),
    at this point, if references shost again, system will show following
    warning msg.
    
    To make scsi_autopm_put_host(shost) always reference a valid shost,
    put it just before scsi_host_put() in function
    scsi_finish_async_scan().

    genirq: Handle pending irqs in irq_startup()
    
    commit b4bc724e82e80478cba5fe9825b62e71ddf78757 upstream.
    
    An interrupt might be pending when irq_startup() is called, but the
    startup code does not invoke the resend logic. In some cases this
    prevents the device from issuing another interrupt which renders the
    device non functional.
    
    Call the resend function in irq_startup() to keep things going.

    genirq: Unmask oneshot irqs when thread was not woken
    
    commit ac5637611150281f398bb7a47e3fcb69a09e7803 upstream.
    
    When the primary handler of an interrupt which is marked IRQ_ONESHOT
    returns IRQ_HANDLED or IRQ_NONE, then the interrupt thread is not
    woken and the unmask logic of the interrupt line is never
    invoked. This keeps the interrupt masked forever.
    
    This was not noticed as most IRQ_ONESHOT users wake the thread
    unconditionally (usually because they cannot access the underlying
    device from hard interrupt context). Though this behaviour was nowhere
    documented and not necessarily intentional. Some drivers can avoid the
    thread wakeup in certain cases and run into the situation where the
    interrupt line s kept masked.
    
    Handle it gracefully.

    ath9k: stop on rates with idx -1 in ath9k rate control's .tx_status
    
    commit 2504a6423b9ab4c36df78227055995644de19edb upstream.
    
    Rate control algorithms are supposed to stop processing when they
    encounter a rate with the index -1.  Checking for rate->count not being
    zero is not enough.
    
    Allowing a rate with negative index leads to memory corruption in
    ath_debug_stat_rc().
    
    One consequence of the bug is discussed at

    x86/amd: Fix L1i and L2 cache sharing information for AMD family 15h processors
    
    commit 32c3233885eb10ac9cb9410f2f8cd64b8df2b2a1 upstream.
    
    For L1 instruction cache and L2 cache the shared CPU information
    is wrong. On current AMD family 15h CPUs those caches are shared
    between both cores of a compute unit.
    
    This fixes https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42607

    ARM: omap: fix oops in drivers/video/omap2/dss/dpi.c
    
    commit 40410715715178ec196314dd0c19150c06901f80 upstream.
    
    When a PMIC is not found, this driver is unable to obtain its
    'vdds_dsi_reg' regulator.  Even through its initialization function
    fails, other code still calls its enable function, which fails to
    check whether it has this regulator before asking for it to be enabled.
    
    This fixes the oops, however a better fix would be to sort out the
    upper layers to prevent them calling into a module which failed to
    initialize.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix surround output regression on Acer Aspire 5935
    
    commit ef8d60fb79614a86a82720dc2402631dbcafb315 upstream.
    
    The previous fix for the speaker on Acer Aspire 59135 introduced
    another problem for surround outputs.  It changed the connections on
    the line-in/mic pins for limiting the routes, but it left the modified
    connections.  Thus wrong connection indices were written when set to
    4ch or 6ch mode.
    
    This patch fixes it by restoring the right connections just after
    parsing the tree but before the initialization.

    usb-storage: fix freezing of the scanning thread
    
    commit bb94a406682770a35305daaa241ccdb7cab399de upstream.
    
    This patch (as1521b) fixes the interaction between usb-storage's
    scanning thread and the freezer.  The current implementation has a
    race: If the device is unplugged shortly after being plugged in and
    just as a system sleep begins, the scanning thread may get frozen
    before the khubd task.  Khubd won't be able to freeze until the
    disconnect processing is complete, and the disconnect processing can't
    proceed until the scanning thread finishes, so the sleep transition
    will fail.
    
    The implementation in the 3.2 kernel suffers from an additional
    problem.  There the scanning thread calls set_freezable_with_signal(),
    and the signals sent by the freezer will mess up the thread's I/O
    delays, which are all interruptible.
    
    The solution to both problems is the same: Replace the kernel thread
    used for scanning with a delayed-work routine on the system freezable
    work queue.  Freezable work queues have the nice property that you can
    cancel a work item even while the work queue is frozen, and no signals
    are needed.
    
    The 3.2 version of this patch solves the problem in Bugzilla #42730.

    USB: Set hub depth after USB3 hub reset
    
    commit a45aa3b30583e7d54e7cf4fbcd0aa699348a6e5c upstream.
    
    The superspeed device attached to a USB 3.0 hub(such as VIA's)
    doesn't respond the address device command after resume. The
    root cause is the superspeed hub will miss the Hub Depth value
    that is used as an offset into the route string to locate the
    bits it uses to determine the downstream port number after
    reset, and all packets can't be routed to the device attached
    to the superspeed hub.
    
    Hub driver sends a Set Hub Depth request to the superspeed hub
    except for USB 3.0 root hub when the hub is initialized and
    doesn't send the request again after reset due to the resume
    process. So moving the code that sends the Set Hub Depth request
    to the superspeed hub from hub_configure() to hub_activate()
    is to cover those situations include initialization and reset.
    
    The patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.39.

    USB: Don't fail USB3 probe on missing legacy PCI IRQ.
    
    commit 68d07f64b8a11a852d48d1b05b724c3e20c0d94b upstream.
    
    Intel has a PCI USB xhci host controller on a new platform. It doesn't
    have a line IRQ definition in BIOS.  The Linux driver refuses to
    initialize this controller, but Windows works well because it only depends
    on MSI.
    
    Actually, Linux also can work for MSI.  This patch avoids the line IRQ
    checking for USB3 HCDs in usb core PCI probe.  It allows the xHCI driver
    to try to enable MSI or MSI-X first.  It will fail the probe if MSI
    enabling failed and there's no legacy PCI IRQ.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.32.

    xhci: Fix encoding for HS bulk/control NAK rate.
    
    commit 340a3504fd39dad753ba908fb6f894ee81fc3ae2 upstream.
    
    The xHCI 0.96 spec says that HS bulk and control endpoint NAK rate must
    be encoded as an exponent of two number of microframes.  The endpoint
    descriptor has the NAK rate encoded in number of microframes.  We were
    just copying the value from the endpoint descriptor into the endpoint
    context interval field, which was not correct.  This lead to the VIA
    host rejecting the add of a bulk OUT endpoint from any USB 2.0 mass
    storage device.
    
    The fix is to use the correct encoding.  Refactor the code to convert
    number of frames to an exponential number of microframes, and make sure
    we convert the number of microframes in HS bulk and control endpoints to
    an exponent.
    
    This should be back ported to kernels as old as 2.6.31, that contain the
    commit dfa49c4ad120a784ef1ff0717168aa79f55a483a "USB: xhci - fix math

    USB: Fix handoff when BIOS disables host PCI device.
    
    commit cab928ee1f221c9cc48d6615070fefe2e444384a upstream.
    
    On some systems with an Intel Panther Point xHCI host controller, the
    BIOS disables the xHCI PCI device during boot, and switches the xHCI
    ports over to EHCI.  This allows the BIOS to access USB devices without
    having xHCI support.
    
    The downside is that the xHCI BIOS handoff mechanism will fail because
    memory mapped I/O is not enabled for the disabled PCI device.
    Jesse Barnes says this is expected behavior.  The PCI core will enable
    BARs before quirks run, but it will leave it in an undefined state, and
    it may not have memory mapped I/O enabled.
    
    Make the generic USB quirk handler call pci_enable_device() to re-enable
    MMIO, and call pci_disable_device() once the host-specific BIOS handoff
    is finished.  This will balance the ref counts in the PCI core.  When
    the PCI probe function is called, usb_hcd_pci_probe() will call
    pci_enable_device() again.
    
    This should be back ported to kernels as old as 2.6.31.  That was the
    first kernel with xHCI support, and no one has complained about BIOS
    handoffs failing due to memory mapped I/O being disabled on other hosts
    (EHCI, UHCI, or OHCI).

    USB: Remove duplicate USB 3.0 hub feature #defines.
    
    commit d9f5343e35d9138432657202afa8e3ddb2ade360 upstream.
    
    Somehow we ended up with duplicate hub feature #defines in ch11.h.
    Tatyana Brokhman first created the USB 3.0 hub feature macros in 2.6.38
    with commit 0eadcc09203349b11ca477ec367079b23d32ab91 "usb: USB3.0 ch11
    definitions".  In 2.6.39, I modified a patch from John Youn that added
    similar macros in a different place in the same file, and committed
    dbe79bbe9dcb22cb3651c46f18943477141ca452 "USB 3.0 Hub Changes".
    
    Some of the #defines used different names for the same values.  Others
    used exactly the same names with the same values, like these gems:
    
     #define USB_PORT_FEAT_BH_PORT_RESET     28
    ...
     #define USB_PORT_FEAT_BH_PORT_RESET            28
    
    According to my very geeky husband (who looked it up in the C99 spec),
    it is allowed to have object-like macros with duplicate names as long as
    the replacement list is exactly the same.  However, he recalled that
    some compilers will give warnings when they find duplicate macros.  It's
    probably best to remove the duplicates in the stable tree, so that the
    code compiles for everyone.
    
    The macros are now fixed to move the feature requests that are specific
    to USB 3.0 hubs into a new section (out of the USB 2.0 hub feature
    section), and use the most common macro name.
    
    This patch should be backported to 2.6.39.

    tcp_shifted_skb() for FACK TCP senders. The lost_cnt_hint adjustment
    in tcp_sacktag_one() only applies to non-FACK senders, so FACK senders
    need their own adjustment.
    
    This applies the spirit of 1e5289e121372a3494402b1b131b41bfe1cf9b7f -
    except now that the sequence range passed into tcp_sacktag_one() is
    correct we need only have a special case adjustment for FACK.

    tcp: fix range tcp_shifted_skb() passes to tcp_sacktag_one()
    
    [ Upstream commit daef52bab1fd26e24e8e9578f8fb33ba1d0cb412 ]
    
    Fix the newly-SACKed range to be the range of newly-shifted bytes.
    
    Previously - since 832d11c5cd076abc0aa1eaf7be96c81d1a59ce41 -
    tcp_shifted_skb() incorrectly called tcp_sacktag_one() with the start
    and end sequence numbers of the skb it passes in set to the range just
    beyond the range that is newly-SACKed.
    
    This commit also removes a special-case adjustment to lost_cnt_hint in
    tcp_shifted_skb() since the pre-existing adjustment of lost_cnt_hint
    in tcp_sacktag_one() now properly handles this things now that the
    correct start sequence number is passed in.

    tcp: allow tcp_sacktag_one() to tag ranges not aligned with skbs

    This commit allows callers of tcp_sacktag_one() to pass in sequence
    ranges that do not align with skb boundaries, as tcp_shifted_skb()
    needs to do in an upcoming fix in this patch series.
    
    In fact, now tcp_sacktag_one() does not need to depend on an input skb
    at all, which makes its semantics and dependencies more clear.

    gro: more generic L2 header check
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ca3b72c5da47d95b83857b768def6172fbc080a ]
    
    Shlomo Pongratz reported GRO L2 header check was suited for Ethernet
    only, and failed on IB/ipoib traffic.
    
    He provided a patch faking a zeroed header to let GRO aggregates frames.
    
    Roland Dreier, Herbert Xu, and others suggested we change GRO L2 header
    check to be more generic, ie not assuming L2 header is 14 bytes, but
    taking into account hard_header_len.
    
    __napi_gro_receive() has special handling for the common case (Ethernet)
    to avoid a memcmp() call and use an inline optimized function instead.

    IPoIB: Stop lying about hard_header_len and use skb->cb to stash LL addresses
    
    [ Upstream commit 936d7de3d736e0737542641269436f4b5968e9ef ]
    
    Commit a0417fa3a18a ("net: Make qdisc_skb_cb upper size bound
    explicit.") made it possible for a netdev driver to use skb->cb
    between its header_ops.create method and its .ndo_start_xmit
    method.  Use this in ipoib_hard_header() to stash away the LL address
    (GID + QPN), instead of the "ipoib_pseudoheader" hack.  This allows
    IPoIB to stop lying about its hard_header_len, which will let us fix
    the L2 check for GRO.

    tcp_v4_send_reset: binding oif to iif in no sock case
    
    [ Upstream commit e2446eaab5585555a38ea0df4e01ff313dbb4ac9 ]
    
    Binding RST packet outgoing interface to incoming interface
    for tcp v4 when there is no socket associate with it.
    when sk is not NULL, using sk->sk_bound_dev_if instead.
    (suggested by Eric Dumazet).
    
    This has few benefits:
    1. tcp_v6_send_reset already did that.
    2. This helps tcp connect with SO_BINDTODEVICE set. When
    connection is lost, we still able to sending out RST using
    same interface.
    3. we are sending reply, it is most likely to be succeed
    if iif is used

    ipv4: reset flowi parameters on route connect
    
    [ Upstream commit e6b45241c57a83197e5de9166b3b0d32ac562609 ]
    
    Eric Dumazet found that commit 813b3b5db83
    (ipv4: Use caller's on-stack flowi as-is in output
    route lookups.) that comes in 3.0 added a regression.
    The problem appears to be that resulting flowi4_oif is
    used incorrectly as input parameter to some routing lookups.
    The result is that when connecting to local port without
    listener if the IP address that is used is not on a loopback
    interface we incorrectly assign RTN_UNICAST to the output
    route because no route is matched by oif=lo. The RST packet
    can not be sent immediately by tcp_v4_send_reset because
    it expects RTN_LOCAL.
    
            So, change ip_route_connect and ip_route_newports to
    update the flowi4 fields that are input parameters because
    we do not want unnecessary binding to oif.
    
            To make it clear what are the input parameters that
    can be modified during lookup and to show which fields of
    floiw4 are reused add a new function to update the flowi4
    structure: flowi4_update_output.

    program to reproduce the problem.

    ARM: 7325/1: fix v7 boot with lockdep enabled
    
    commit 8e43a905dd574f54c5715d978318290ceafbe275 upstream.
    
    Bootup with lockdep enabled has been broken on v7 since b46c0f74657d
    ("ARM: 7321/1: cache-v7: Disable preemption when reading CCSIDR").
    
    This is because v7_setup (which is called very early during boot) calls
    v7_flush_dcache_all, and the save_and_disable_irqs added by that patch
    ends up attempting to call into lockdep C code (trace_hardirqs_off())
    when we are in no position to execute it (no stack, MMU off).
    
    Fix this by using a notrace variant of save_and_disable_irqs.  The code
    already uses the notrace variant of restore_irqs.

    ARM: 7321/1: cache-v7: Disable preemption when reading CCSIDR
    
    commit b46c0f74657d1fe1c1b0c1452631cc38a9e6987f upstream.
    
    armv7's flush_cache_all() flushes caches via set/way. To
    determine the cache attributes (line size, number of sets,
    etc.) the assembly first writes the CSSELR register to select a
    cache level and then reads the CCSIDR register. The CSSELR register
    is banked per-cpu and is used to determine which cache level CCSIDR
    reads. If the task is migrated between when the CSSELR is written and
    the CCSIDR is read the CCSIDR value may be for an unexpected cache
    level (for example L1 instead of L2) and incorrect cache flushing
    could occur.
    
    Disable interrupts across the write and read so that the correct
    cache attributes are read and used for the cache flushing
    routine. We disable interrupts instead of disabling preemption
    because the critical section is only 3 instructions and we want
    to call v7_dcache_flush_all from __v7_setup which doesn't have a
    full kernel stack with a struct thread_info.
    
    This fixes a problem we see in scm_call() when flush_cache_all()
    is called from preemptible context and sometimes the L2 cache is
    not properly flushed out.

    Commit bf118a342f10dafe44b14451a1392c3254629a1f (NFSv4: include bitmap
    in nfsv4 get acl data) introduces the 'acl_scratch' page for the case
    where we may need to decode multi-page data. However it fails to take
    into account the fact that the variable may be NULL (for the case where
    we're not doing multi-page decode), and it also attaches it to the
    encoding xdr_stream rather than the decoding one.
    
    The immediate result is an Oops in nfs4_xdr_enc_getacl due to the
    call to page_address() with a NULL page pointer.

    mmc: core: check for zero length ioctl data
    
    commit 4d6144de8ba263eb3691a737c547e5b2fdc45287 upstream.
    
    If the read or write buffer size associated with the command sent
    through the mmc_blk_ioctl is zero, do not prepare data buffer.
    
    This enables a ioctl(2) call to for instance send a MMC_SWITCH to set
    a byte in the ext_csd.

    ALSA: hda - Fix redundant jack creations for cx5051
    
    [Note that since the patch isn't applicable (and unnecessary) to
    3.3-rc, there is no corresponding upstream fix.]
    
    The cx5051 parser calls snd_hda_input_jack_add() in the init callback
    to create and initialize the jack detection instances.  Since the init
    callback is called at each time when the device gets woken up after
    suspend or power-saving mode, the duplicated instances are accumulated
    at each call.  This ends up with the kernel warnings with the too
    large array size.
    
    The fix is simply to move the calls of snd_hda_input_jack_add() into
    the parser section instead of the init callback.
    
    The fix is needed only up to 3.2 kernel, since the HD-audio jack layer
    was redesigned in the 3.3 kernel.

    S390: correct ktime to tod clock comparator conversion
    
    commit cf1eb40f8f5ea12c9e569e7282161fc7f194fd62 upstream.
    
    The conversion of the ktime to a value suitable for the clock comparator
    does not take changes to wall_to_monotonic into account. In fact the
    conversion just needs the boot clock (sched_clock_base_cc) and the
    total_sleep_time.
    
    This is applicable to 3.2+ kernels.

    eCryptfs: Copy up lower inode attrs after setting lower xattr
    
    commit 545d680938be1e86a6c5250701ce9abaf360c495 upstream.
    
    After passing through a ->setxattr() call, eCryptfs needs to copy the
    inode attributes from the lower inode to the eCryptfs inode, as they
    may have changed in the lower filesystem's ->setxattr() path.
    
    One example is if an extended attribute containing a POSIX Access
    Control List is being set. The new ACL may cause the lower filesystem to
    modify the mode of the lower inode and the eCryptfs inode would need to
    be updated to reflect the new mode.

    regmap: Fix cache defaults initialization from raw cache defaults
    
    commit 61cddc57dc14a5dffa0921d9a24fd68edbb374ac upstream.
    
    Currently registers with a value of 0 are ignored when initializing the register
    defaults from raw defaults. This worked in the past, because registers without a
    explicit default were assumed to have a default value of 0. This was changed in
    commit b03622a8 ("regmap: Ensure rbtree syncs registers set to zero properly").
    As a result registers, which have a raw default value of 0 are now assumed to
    have no default. This again can result in unnecessary writes when syncing the
    cache. It will also result in unnecessary reads for e.g. the first update
    operation. In the case where readback is not possible this will even let the
    update operation fail, if the register has not been written to before.
    
    So this patch removes the check. Instead it adds a check to ignore raw defaults
    for registers which are volatile, since those registers are not cached.

    mac80211: Fix a rwlock bad magic bug
    
    commit b57e6b560fc2a2742910ac5ca0eb2c46e45aeac2 upstream.
    
    read_lock(&tpt_trig->trig.leddev_list_lock) is accessed via the path
    ieee80211_open (->) ieee80211_do_open (->) ieee80211_mod_tpt_led_trig
    (->) ieee80211_start_tpt_led_trig (->) tpt_trig_timer before initializing
    it.
    the intilization of this read/write lock happens via the path
    ieee80211_led_init (->) led_trigger_register, but we are doing
    'ieee80211_led_init'  after 'ieeee80211_if_add' where we
    register netdev_ops.
    so we access leddev_list_lock before initializing it and causes the
    following bug in chrome laptops with AR928X cards with the following
    script
    
    while true
    do
    sudo modprobe -v ath9k
    sleep 3
    sudo modprobe -r ath9k
    sleep 3
    done

    PCI: workaround hard-wired bus number V2
    
    commit 71f6bd4a23130cd2f4b036010c5790b1295290b9 upstream.
    
    Fixes PCI device detection on IBM xSeries IBM 3850 M2 / x3950 M2
    when using ACPI resources (_CRS).
    This is default, a manual workaround (without this patch)
    would be pci=nocrs boot param.
    
    V2: Add dev_warn if the workaround is hit. This should reveal
    how common such setups are (via google) and point to possible
    problems if things are still not working as expected.

    perf on POWER stopped working after commit e050e3f0a71b (perf: Fix
    broken interrupt rate throttling). That patch exposed a bug in
    the POWER perf_events code.
    
    Since the PMCs count upwards and take an exception when the top bit
    is set, we want to write 0x80000000 - left in power_pmu_start. We were
    instead programming in left which effectively disables the counter
    until we eventually hit 0x80000000. This could take seconds or longer.
    
    With the patch applied I get the expected number of samples:
