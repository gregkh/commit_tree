    arm64: KVM: Fix host crash when injecting a fault into a 32bit guest
    
    commit 126c69a0bd0e441bf6766a5d9bf20de011be9f68 upstream.
    
    When injecting a fault into a misbehaving 32bit guest, it seems
    rather idiotic to also inject a 64bit fault that is only going
    to corrupt the guest state. This leads to a situation where we
    perform an illegal exception return at EL2 causing the host
    to crash instead of killing the guest.
    
    Just fix the stupid bug that has been there from day 1.

    SCSI: Fix NULL pointer dereference in runtime PM
    
    commit 49718f0fb8c9af192b33d8af3a2826db04025371 upstream.
    
    The routines in scsi_rpm.c assume that if a runtime-PM callback is
    invoked for a SCSI device, it can only mean that the device's driver
    has asked the block layer to handle the runtime power management (by
    calling blk_pm_runtime_init(), which among other things sets q->dev).
    
    However, this assumption turns out to be wrong for things like the ses
    driver.  Normally ses devices are not allowed to do runtime PM, but
    userspace can override this setting.  If this happens, the kernel gets
    a NULL pointer dereference when blk_post_runtime_resume() tries to use
    the uninitialized q->dev pointer.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by calling the block layer's runtime-PM
    routines only if the device's driver really does have a runtime-PM
    callback routine.  Since ses doesn't define any such callbacks, the
    crash won't occur.
    
    This fixes Bugzilla #101371.

    arm64/mm: Remove hack in mmap randomize layout
    
    commit d6c763afab142a85e4770b4bc2a5f40f256d5c5d upstream.
    
    Since commit 8a0a9bd4db63 ('random: make get_random_int() more
    random'), get_random_int() returns a random value for each call,
    so comment and hack introduced in mmap_rnd() as part of commit
    1d18c47c735e ('arm64: MMU fault handling and page table management')
    are incorrects.
    
    Commit 1d18c47c735e seems to use the same hack introduced by
    commit a5adc91a4b44 ('powerpc: Ensure random space between stack
    and mmaps'), latter copied in commit 5a0efea09f42 ('sparc64: Sharpen
    address space randomization calculations.').
    
    But both architectures were cleaned up as part of commit
    fa8cbaaf5a68 ('powerpc+sparc64/mm: Remove hack in mmap randomize
    layout') as hack is no more needed since commit 8a0a9bd4db63.
    
    So the present patch removes the comment and the hack around
    get_random_int() on AArch64's mmap_rnd().

    When inserting a new register into a block, the present bit map size is
    increased using krealloc. krealloc does not clear the additionally

    some registers are considered cached even though this is not the case.

    Due to patch "libfc: Do not invoke the response handler after

    drm/vmwgfx: Fix execbuf locking issues
    
    commit 3e04e2fe6d87807d27521ad6ebb9e7919d628f25 upstream.
    
    This addresses two issues that cause problems with viewperf maya-03 in
    situation with memory pressure.
    
    The first issue causes attempts to unreserve buffers if batched
    reservation fails due to, for example, a signal pending. While previously
    the ttm_eu api was resistant against this type of error, it is no longer
    and the lockdep code will complain about attempting to unreserve buffers
    that are not reserved. The issue is resolved by avoid calling
    ttm_eu_backoff_reservation in the buffer reserve error path.
    
    The second issue is that the binding_mutex may be held when user-space
    fence objects are created and hence during memory reclaims. This may cause
    recursive attempts to grab the binding mutex. The issue is resolved by not
    holding the binding mutex across fence creation and submission.

    perf: Fix fasync handling on inherited events
    
    commit fed66e2cdd4f127a43fd11b8d92a99bdd429528c upstream.
    
    Vince reported that the fasync signal stuff doesn't work proper for
    inherited events. So fix that.
    
    Installing fasync allocates memory and sets filp->f_flags |= FASYNC,
    which upon the demise of the file descriptor ensures the allocation is
    freed and state is updated.
    
    Now for perf, we can have the events stick around for a while after the
    original FD is dead because of references from child events. So we
    cannot copy the fasync pointer around. We can however consistently use
    the parent's fasync, as that will be updated.

    When we are using persistent grants the indirect_pages list
    should always be empty because blkfront has pre-allocated enough
    persistent pages to fill all requests on the ring.

    ipc/sem.c: update/correct memory barriers
    
    commit 3ed1f8a99d70ea1cd1508910eb107d0edcae5009 upstream.
    
    sem_lock() did not properly pair memory barriers:
    
    !spin_is_locked() and spin_unlock_wait() are both only control barriers.
    The code needs an acquire barrier, otherwise the cpu might perform read
    operations before the lock test.
    
    As no primitive exists inside <include/spinlock.h> and since it seems
    noone wants another primitive, the code creates a local primitive within
    ipc/sem.c.
    
    With regards to -stable:
    
    The change of sem_wait_array() is a bugfix, the change to sem_lock() is a
    nop (just a preprocessor redefinition to improve the readability).  The
    bugfix is necessary for all kernels that use sem_wait_array() (i.e.:
    starting from 3.10).

    ipc,sem: fix use after free on IPC_RMID after a task using same semaphore set exits
    
    commit 602b8593d2b4138c10e922eeaafe306f6b51817b upstream.
    
    The current semaphore code allows a potential use after free: in
    exit_sem we may free the task's sem_undo_list while there is still
    another task looping through the same semaphore set and cleaning the
    sem_undo list at freeary function (the task called IPC_RMID for the same
    semaphore set).
    
    For example, with a test program [1] running which keeps forking a lot
    of processes (which then do a semop call with SEM_UNDO flag), and with
    the parent right after removing the semaphore set with IPC_RMID, and a
    kernel built with CONFIG_SLAB, CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG and
    CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK, you can easily see something like the following
    in the kernel log:

       Kernel panic - not syncing: softlockup: hung tasks
    
    I wasn't able to trigger any badness on a recent kernel without the
    proper config debugs enabled, however I have softlockup reports on some
    kernel versions, in the semaphore code, which are similar as above (the
    scenario is seen on some servers running IBM DB2 which uses semaphore
    syscalls).
    
    The patch here fixes the race against freeary, by acquiring or waiting
    on the sem_undo_list lock as necessary (exit_sem can race with freeary,
    while freeary sets un->semid to -1 and removes the same sem_undo from
    list_proc or when it removes the last sem_undo).
    
    After the patch I'm unable to reproduce the problem using the test case
    [1].
