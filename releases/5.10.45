    drm/amd/display: Fix potential memory leak in DMUB hw_init
    
    [ Upstream commit c5699e2d863f58221044efdc3fa712dd32d55cde ]
    
    [Why]
    On resume we perform DMUB hw_init which allocates memory:
    dm_resume->dm_dmub_hw_init->dc_dmub_srv_create->kzalloc
    That results in memory leak in suspend/resume scenarios.
    
    [How]
    Allocate memory for the DC wrapper to DMUB only if it was not
    allocated before.
    No need to reallocate it on suspend/resume.

    [ Upstream commit 1ab19c5de4c537ec0d9b21020395a5b5a6c059b2 ]
    
    The GLF_LRU flag is checked under lru_lock in gfs2_glock_remove_from_lru() to
    remove the glock from the lru list in __gfs2_glock_put().
    
    On the shrink scan path, the same flag is cleared under lru_lock but because
    of cond_resched_lock(&lru_lock) in gfs2_dispose_glock_lru(), progress on the
    put side can be made without deleting the glock from the lru list.
    
    Keep GLF_LRU across the race window opened by cond_resched_lock(&lru_lock) to
    ensure correct behavior on both sides - clear GLF_LRU after list_del under
    lru_lock.

    This patch makes a special exception for the statfs system inode glock,
    which allows the statfs glock UNLOCK to proceed normally. That allows the
    quotad daemon to exit during the withdraw, which allows the logd daemon
    to exit during the withdraw, which allows the mount to exit.

    [ Upstream commit 43a511c44e58e357a687d61a20cf5ef1dc9e5a7c ]
    
    When a direct I/O write falls entirely and falls back to buffered I/O and the
    buffered I/O fails, the write failed with return value 0 instead of the error
    number reported by the buffered I/O. Fix that.

    drm/tegra: sor: Fully initialize SOR before registration
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dea42759bcef74b0802ea64b904409bc37f9045 ]
    
    Before registering the SOR host1x client, make sure that it is fully
    initialized. This avoids a potential race condition between the SOR's
    probe and the host1x device initialization in cases where the SOR is
    the final sub-device to register to a host1x instance.

    gpu: host1x: Split up client initalization and registration
    
    [ Upstream commit 0cfe5a6e758fb20be8ad3e8f10cb087cc8033eeb ]
    
    In some cases we may need to initialize the host1x client first before
    registering it. This commit adds a new helper that will do nothing but
    the initialization of the data structure.
    
    At the same time, the initialization is removed from the registration
    function. Note, however, that for simplicity we explicitly initialize
    the client when the host1x_client_register() function is called, as
    opposed to the low-level __host1x_client_register() function. This
    allows existing callers to remain unchanged.

    drm/tegra: sor: Do not leak runtime PM reference
    
    [ Upstream commit 73a395c46704304b96bc5e2ee19be31124025c0c ]
    
    It's theoretically possible for the runtime PM reference to leak if the
    code fails anywhere between the pm_runtime_resume_and_get() and
    pm_runtime_put() calls, so make sure to release the runtime PM reference
    in that case.
    
    Practically this will never happen because none of the functions will
    fail on Tegra, but it's better for the code to be pedantic in case these
    assumptions will ever become wrong.

    HID: usbhid: fix info leak in hid_submit_ctrl
    
    [ Upstream commit 6be388f4a35d2ce5ef7dbf635a8964a5da7f799f ]
    
    In hid_submit_ctrl(), the way of calculating the report length doesn't
    take into account that report->size can be zero. When running the
    syzkaller reproducer, a report of size 0 causes hid_submit_ctrl) to
    calculate transfer_buffer_length as 16384. When this urb is passed to
    the usb core layer, KMSAN reports an info leak of 16384 bytes.
    
    To fix this, first modify hid_report_len() to account for the zero
    report size case by using DIV_ROUND_UP for the division. Then, call it
    from hid_submit_ctrl().
