    bpf: Add selftests to cover packet access corner cases
    
    commit b560b21f71eb4ef9dfc7c8ec1d0e4d7f9aa54b51 upstream.
    
    This commit adds BPF verifier selftests that cover all corner cases by
    packet boundary checks. Specifically, 8-byte packet reads are tested at
    the beginning of data and at the beginning of data_meta, using all kinds
    of boundary checks (all comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=; both
    permutations of operands: data + length compared to end, end compared to
    data + length). For each case there are three tests:
    
    1. Length is just enough for an 8-byte read. Length is either 7 or 8,
       depending on the comparison.
    
    2. Length is increased by 1 - should still pass the verifier. These
       cases are useful, because they failed before commit 2fa7d94afc1a
       ("bpf: Fix the off-by-two error in range markings").
    
    3. Length is decreased by 1 - should be rejected by the verifier.
    
    Some existing tests are just renamed to avoid duplication.

    misc: fastrpc: fix improper packet size calculation
    
    commit 3a1bf591e9a410f220b7405a142a47407394a1d5 upstream.
    
    The buffer list is sorted and this is not being considered while
    calculating packet size. This would lead to improper copy length
    calculation for non-dmaheap buffers which would eventually cause
    sending improper buffers to DSP.

    commit b383a42ca523ce54bcbd63f7c8f3cf974abc9b9a upstream.
    
    INVALL CMD specifies that the ITS must ensure any caching associated with
    the interrupt collection defined by ICID is consistent with the LPI
    configuration tables held in memory for all Redistributors. SYNC is
    required to ensure that INVALL is executed.
    
    Currently, LPI configuration data may be inconsistent with that in the

    irqchip/armada-370-xp: Fix support for Multi-MSI interrupts
    
    commit d0a553502efd545c1ce3fd08fc4d423f8e4ac3d6 upstream.
    
    irq-armada-370-xp driver already sets MSI_FLAG_MULTI_PCI_MSI flag into
    msi_domain_info structure. But allocated interrupt numbers for Multi-MSI
    needs to be properly aligned otherwise devices send MSI interrupt with
    wrong number.
    
    Fix this issue by using function bitmap_find_free_region() instead of
    bitmap_find_next_zero_area() to allocate aligned interrupt numbers.

    commit 92beafb76a31bdc02649eb44e93a8e4f4cfcdbe8 upstream.
    
    Both the charging and discharging currents on AXP22x are stored as
    12-bit integers, in accordance with the datasheet.
    It's also confirmed by vendor BSP (axp20x_adc.c:axp22_icharge_to_mA).
    
    The scale factor of 0.5 is never mentioned in datasheet, nor in the
    vendor source code. I think it was here to compensate for
    erroneous addition bit in register width.
    
    Tested on custom A40i+AXP221s board with external ammeter as
    a reference.

    commit 45febe0d63917ee908198c5be08511c64ee1790a upstream.
    
    IIO trigger handlers need to return one of the irqreturn_t values.

    The kxsd9 interrupt handler returns an error code if reading the data
    registers fails. In addition when exiting due to an error the trigger
    handler does not call `iio_trigger_notify_done()`. Which when not done
    keeps the triggered disabled forever.
    
    Modify the code so that the function returns a valid irqreturn_t value as
    well as calling `iio_trigger_notify_done()` on all exit paths.
    
    Since we can't return the error code make sure to at least log it as part
    of the error message.

    commit cd0082235783f814241a1c9483fb89e405f4f892 upstream.
    
    The mma8452 driver directly assigns a trigger to the struct iio_dev. The
    IIO core when done using this trigger will call `iio_trigger_put()` to drop
    the reference count by 1.
    
    Without the matching `iio_trigger_get()` in the driver the reference count
    can reach 0 too early, the trigger gets freed while still in use and a
    use-after-free occurs.
    
    Fix this by getting a reference to the trigger before assigning it to the
    IIO device.

    iio: stk3310: Don't return error code in interrupt handler
    
    commit 8e1eeca5afa7ba84d885987165dbdc5decf15413 upstream.
    
    Interrupt handlers must return one of the irqreturn_t values. Returning a
    error code is not supported.
    
    The stk3310 event interrupt handler returns an error code when reading the
    flags register fails.
    
    Fix the implementation to always return an irqreturn_t value.

    iio: trigger: Fix reference counting
    
    commit a827a4984664308f13599a0b26c77018176d0c7c upstream.
    
    In viio_trigger_alloc() device_initialize() is used to set the initial
    reference count of the trigger to 1. Then another get_device() is called on
    trigger. This sets the reference count to 2 before the trigger is returned.
    
    iio_trigger_free(), which is the matching API to viio_trigger_alloc(),
    calls put_device() which decreases the reference count by 1. But the second
    reference count acquired in viio_trigger_alloc() is never dropped.
    
    As a result the iio_trigger_release() function is never called and the
    memory associated with the trigger is never freed.
    
    Since there is no reason for the trigger to start its lifetime with two
    reference counts just remove the extra get_device() in
    viio_trigger_alloc().

    xhci: avoid race between disable slot command and host runtime suspend
    
    commit 7faac1953ed1f658f719cdf7bb7303fa5eef822c upstream.
    
    Make xhci_disable_slot() synchronous, thus ensuring it, and
    xhci_free_dev() calling it return after xHC controller completes
    the disable slot command.
    
    Otherwise the roothub and xHC host may runtime suspend, and clear the
    command ring while the disable slot command is being processed.
    
    This causes a command completion mismatch as the completion event can't
    be mapped to the correct command.
    Command ring gets out of sync and commands time out.
    Driver finally assumes host is unresponsive and bails out.

    xhci: Remove CONFIG_USB_DEFAULT_PERSIST to prevent xHCI from runtime suspending
    
    commit 811ae81320da53a5670c36970cefacca8519f90e upstream.
    
    When the xHCI is quirked with XHCI_RESET_ON_RESUME, runtime resume
    routine also resets the controller.
    
    This is bad for USB drivers without reset_resume callback, because
    there's no subsequent call of usb_dev_complete() ->
    usb_resume_complete() to force rebinding the driver to the device. For
    instance, btusb device stops working after xHCI controller is runtime
    resumed, if the controlled is quirked with XHCI_RESET_ON_RESUME.
    
    So always take XHCI_RESET_ON_RESUME into account to solve the issue.

    commit 1a3910c80966e4a76b25ce812f6bea0ef1b1d530 upstream.
    
    The checks performed by commit aed9d65ac327 ("USB: validate
    wMaxPacketValue entries in endpoint descriptors") require that initial
    value of the maxp variable contains both maximum packet size bits
    (10..0) and multiple-transactions bits (12..11). However, the existing
    code assings only the maximum packet size bits. This patch assigns all
    bits of wMaxPacketSize to the variable.

    selftests/fib_tests: Rework fib_rp_filter_test()
    
    commit f6071e5e3961eeb5300bd0901c9e128598730ae3 upstream.
    
    Currently rp_filter tests in fib_tests.sh:fib_rp_filter_test() are
    failing.  ping sockets are bound to dummy1 using the "-I" option
    (SO_BINDTODEVICE), but socket lookup is failing when receiving ping
    replies, since the routing table thinks they belong to dummy0.
    
    For example, suppose ping is using a SOCK_RAW socket for ICMP messages.
    When receiving ping replies, in __raw_v4_lookup(), sk->sk_bound_dev_if
    is 3 (dummy1), but dif (skb_rtable(skb)->rt_iif) says 2 (dummy0), so the
    raw_sk_bound_dev_eq() check fails.  Similar things happen in
    ping_lookup() for SOCK_DGRAM sockets.
    
    These tests used to pass due to a bug [1] in iputils, where "ping -I"
    actually did not bind ICMP message sockets to device.  The bug has been
    fixed by iputils commit f455fee41c07 ("ping: also bind the ICMP socket
    to the specific device") in 2016, which is why our rp_filter tests
    started to fail.  See [2] .
    
    Fixing the tests while keeping everything in one netns turns out to be
    nontrivial.  Rework the tests and build the following topology:
    
     ┌─────────────────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
     │  network namespace 1 (ns1)  │    │  network namespace 2 (ns2)  │
     │                             │    │                             │
     │  ┌────┐     ┌─────┐         │    │  ┌─────┐            ┌────┐  │
     │  │ lo │<───>│veth1│<────────┼────┼─>│veth2│<──────────>│ lo │  │
     │  └────┘     ├─────┴──────┐  │    │  ├─────┴──────┐     └────┘  │
     │             │192.0.2.1/24│  │    │  │192.0.2.1/24│             │
     │             └────────────┘  │    │  └────────────┘             │
     └─────────────────────────────┘    └─────────────────────────────┘
    
    Consider sending an ICMP_ECHO packet A in ns2.  Both source and
    destination IP addresses are 192.0.2.1, and we use strict mode rp_filter
    in both ns1 and ns2:
    
      1. A is routed to lo since its destination IP address is one of ns2's
         local addresses (veth2);
      2. A is redirected from lo's egress to veth2's egress using mirred;
      3. A arrives at veth1's ingress in ns1;
      4. A is redirected from veth1's ingress to lo's ingress, again, using
         mirred;
      5. In __fib_validate_source(), fib_info_nh_uses_dev() returns false,
         since A was received on lo, but reverse path lookup says veth1;
      6. However A is not dropped since we have relaxed this check for lo in
         commit 66f8209547cc ("fib: relax source validation check for loopback
         packets");
    
    Making sure A is not dropped here in this corner case is the whole point
    of having this test.
    
      7. As A reaches the ICMP layer, an ICMP_ECHOREPLY packet, B, is
         generated;
      8. Similarly, B is redirected from lo's egress to veth1's egress (in
         ns1), then redirected once again from veth2's ingress to lo's
         ingress (in ns2), using mirred.
    
    Also test "ping 127.0.0.1" from ns2.  It does not trigger the relaxed
    check in __fib_validate_source(), but just to make sure the topology
    works with loopback addresses.
    
    Tested with ping from iputils 20210722-41-gf9fb573:

    net: fec: only clear interrupt of handling queue in fec_enet_rx_queue()
    
    commit b5bd95d17102b6719e3531d627875b9690371383 upstream.
    
    Background:
    We have a customer is running a Profinet stack on the 8MM which receives and
    responds PNIO packets every 4ms and PNIO-CM packets every 40ms. However, from
    time to time the received PNIO-CM package is "stock" and is only handled when
    receiving a new PNIO-CM or DCERPC-Ping packet (tcpdump shows the PNIO-CM and
    the DCERPC-Ping packet at the same time but the PNIO-CM HW timestamp is from
    the expected 40 ms and not the 2s delay of the DCERPC-Ping).
    
    After debugging, we noticed PNIO, PNIO-CM and DCERPC-Ping packets would
    be handled by different RX queues.
    
    The root cause should be driver ack all queues' interrupt when handle a
    specific queue in fec_enet_rx_queue(). The blamed patch is introduced to
    receive as much packets as possible once to avoid interrupt flooding.
    But it's unreasonable to clear other queues'interrupt when handling one
    queue, this patch tries to fix it.

    net: cdc_ncm: Allow for dwNtbOutMaxSize to be unset or zero
    
    commit 2be6d4d16a0849455a5c22490e3c5983495fed00 upstream.
    
    Currently, due to the sequential use of min_t() and clamp_t() macros,
    in cdc_ncm_check_tx_max(), if dwNtbOutMaxSize is not set, the logic
    sets tx_max to 0.  This is then used to allocate the data area of the
    SKB requested later in cdc_ncm_fill_tx_frame().
    
    This does not cause an issue presently because when memory is
    allocated during initialisation phase of SKB creation, more memory
    (512b) is allocated than is required for the SKB headers alone (320b),
    leaving some space (512b - 320b = 192b) for CDC data (172b).
    
    However, if more elements (for example 3 x u64 = [24b]) were added to
    one of the SKB header structs, say 'struct skb_shared_info',
    increasing its original size (320b [320b aligned]) to something larger
    (344b [384b aligned]), then suddenly the CDC data (172b) no longer
    fits in the spare SKB data area (512b - 384b = 128b).
    
    Consequently the SKB bounds checking semantics fails and panics:
    
      skbuff: skb_over_panic: text:ffffffff830a5b5f len:184 put:172   \
         head:ffff888119227c00 data:ffff888119227c00 tail:0xb8 end:0x80 dev:<NULL>

    tools build: Remove needless libpython-version feature check that breaks test-all fast path
    
    commit 3d1d57debee2d342a47615707588b96658fabb85 upstream.
    
    Since 66dfdff03d196e51 ("perf tools: Add Python 3 support") we don't use
    the tools/build/feature/test-libpython-version.c version in any Makefile
    feature check:
    
      $ find tools/ -type f | xargs grep feature-libpython-version
      $
    
    The only place where this was used was removed in 66dfdff03d196e51:
    
      -        ifneq ($(feature-libpython-version), 1)
      -          $(warning Python 3 is not yet supported; please set)
      -          $(warning PYTHON and/or PYTHON_CONFIG appropriately.)
      -          $(warning If you also have Python 2 installed, then)
      -          $(warning try something like:)
      -          $(warning $(and ,))
      -          $(warning $(and ,)  make PYTHON=python2)
      -          $(warning $(and ,))
      -          $(warning Otherwise, disable Python support entirely:)
      -          $(warning $(and ,))
      -          $(warning $(and ,)  make NO_LIBPYTHON=1)
      -          $(warning $(and ,))
      -          $(error   $(and ,))
      -        else
      -          LDFLAGS += $(PYTHON_EMBED_LDFLAGS)
      -          EXTLIBS += $(PYTHON_EMBED_LIBADD)
      -          LANG_BINDINGS += $(obj-perf)python/perf.so
      -          $(call detected,CONFIG_LIBPYTHON)
      -        endif
    
    And nowadays we either build with PYTHON=python3 or just install the
    python3 devel packages and perf will build against it.
    
    But the leftover feature-libpython-version check made the fast path
    feature detection to break in all cases except when python2 devel files
    were installed:
    
      $ rpm -qa | grep python.*devel
      python3-devel-3.9.7-1.fc34.x86_64
      $ rm -rf /tmp/build/perf ; mkdir -p /tmp/build/perf ;
      $ make -C tools/perf O=/tmp/build/perf install-bin
      make: Entering directory '/var/home/acme/git/perf/tools/perf'
        BUILD:   Doing 'make -j32' parallel build
        HOSTCC  /tmp/build/perf/fixdep.o
      <SNIP>
      $ cat /tmp/build/perf/feature/test-all.make.output
      In file included from test-all.c:18:
      test-libpython-version.c:5:10: error: #error
          5 |         #error
            |          ^~~~~
      $ ldd ~/bin/perf | grep python
            libpython3.9.so.1.0 => /lib64/libpython3.9.so.1.0 (0x00007fda6dbcf000)
      $
    
    As python3 is the norm these days, fix this by just removing the unused
    feature-libpython-version feature check, making the test-all fast path
    to work with the common case.
    
    With this:
    
      $ rm -rf /tmp/build/perf ; mkdir -p /tmp/build/perf ;
      $ make -C tools/perf O=/tmp/build/perf install-bin |& head
      make: Entering directory '/var/home/acme/git/perf/tools/perf'

    mtd: rawnand: fsmc: Fix timing computation
    
    commit 9472335eaa1452b51dc8e8edaa1a342997cb80c7 upstream.
    
    Under certain circumstances, the timing settings calculated by
    the FSMC NAND controller driver were inaccurate.
    These settings led to incorrect data reads or fallback to
    timing mode 0 depending on the NAND chip used.
    
    The timing computation did not take into account the following
    constraint given in SPEAr3xx reference manual:
      twait >= tCEA - (tset * TCLK) + TOUTDEL + TINDEL
    
    Enhance the timings calculation by taking into account this
    additional constraint.
    
    This change has no impact on slow timing modes such as mode 0.
    Indeed, on mode 0, computed values are the same with and
    without the patch.
    
    NANDs which previously stayed in mode 0 because of fallback to
    mode 0 can now work at higher speeds and NANDs which were not
    working at all because of the corrupted data work at high
    speeds without troubles.
    
    Overall improvement on a Micron/MT29F1G08 (flash_speed tool):
                            mode0       mode3
    eraseblock write speed  3220 KiB/s  4511 KiB/s
    eraseblock read speed   4491 KiB/s  7529 KiB/s

    qede: validate non LSO skb length
    
    commit 8e227b198a55859bf790dc7f4b1e30c0859c6756 upstream.
    
    Although it is unlikely that stack could transmit a non LSO
    skb with length > MTU, however in some cases or environment such
    occurrences actually resulted into firmware asserts due to packet
    length being greater than the max supported by the device (~9700B).
    
    This patch adds the safeguard for such odd cases to avoid firmware
    asserts.
    
    v2: Added "Fixes" tag with one of the initial driver commit
        which enabled the TX traffic actually (as this was probably
        day1 issue which was discovered recently by some customer
        environment)

    tracefs: Set all files to the same group ownership as the mount option
    
    commit 48b27b6b5191e2e1f2798cd80877b6e4ef47c351 upstream.
    
    As people have been asking to allow non-root processes to have access to
    the tracefs directory, it was considered best to only allow groups to have
    access to the directory, where it is easier to just set the tracefs file
    system to a specific group (as other would be too dangerous), and that way
    the admins could pick which processes would have access to tracefs.
    
    Unfortunately, this broke tooling on Android that expected the other bit
    to be set. For some special cases, for non-root tools to trace the system,
    tracefs would be mounted and change the permissions of the top level
    directory which gave access to all running tasks permission to the
    tracing directory. Even though this would be dangerous to do in a
    production environment, for testing environments this can be useful.
    
    Now with the new changes to not allow other (which is still the proper
    thing to do), it breaks the testing tooling. Now more code needs to be
    loaded on the system to change ownership of the tracing directory.
    
    The real solution is to have tracefs honor the gid=xxx option when
    mounting. That is,
    
    (tracing group tracing has value 1003)
    
     mount -t tracefs -o gid=1003 tracefs /sys/kernel/tracing
    
    should have it that all files in the tracing directory should be of the
    given group.
    
    Copy the logic from d_walk() from dcache.c and simplify it for the mount
    case of tracefs if gid is set. All the files in tracefs will be walked and
    their group will be set to the value passed in.

    aio: fix use-after-free due to missing POLLFREE handling
    
    commit 50252e4b5e989ce64555c7aef7516bdefc2fea72 upstream.
    
    signalfd_poll() and binder_poll() are special in that they use a
    waitqueue whose lifetime is the current task, rather than the struct
    file as is normally the case.  This is okay for blocking polls, since a
    blocking poll occurs within one task; however, non-blocking polls
    require another solution.  This solution is for the queue to be cleared
    before it is freed, by sending a POLLFREE notification to all waiters.
    
    Unfortunately, only eventpoll handles POLLFREE.  A second type of
    non-blocking poll, aio poll, was added in kernel v4.18, and it doesn't
    handle POLLFREE.  This allows a use-after-free to occur if a signalfd or
    binder fd is polled with aio poll, and the waitqueue gets freed.
    
    Fix this by making aio poll handle POLLFREE.
    
    A patch by Ramji Jiyani <ramjiyani@google.com>
    (https://lore.kernel.org/r/20211027011834.2497484-1-ramjiyani@google.com)
    tried to do this by making aio_poll_wake() always complete the request
    inline if POLLFREE is seen.  However, that solution had two bugs.
    First, it introduced a deadlock, as it unconditionally locked the aio
    context while holding the waitqueue lock, which inverts the normal
    locking order.  Second, it didn't consider that POLLFREE notifications
    are missed while the request has been temporarily de-queued.
    
    The second problem was solved by my previous patch.  This patch then
    properly fixes the use-after-free by handling POLLFREE in a
    deadlock-free way.  It does this by taking advantage of the fact that
    freeing of the waitqueue is RCU-delayed, similar to what eventpoll does.

    aio: keep poll requests on waitqueue until completed
    
    commit 363bee27e25804d8981dd1c025b4ad49dc39c530 upstream.
    
    Currently, aio_poll_wake() will always remove the poll request from the
    waitqueue.  Then, if aio_poll_complete_work() sees that none of the
    polled events are ready and the request isn't cancelled, it re-adds the
    request to the waitqueue.  (This can easily happen when polling a file
    that doesn't pass an event mask when waking up its waitqueue.)
    
    This is fundamentally broken for two reasons:
    
      1. If a wakeup occurs between vfs_poll() and the request being
         re-added to the waitqueue, it will be missed because the request
         wasn't on the waitqueue at the time.  Therefore, IOCB_CMD_POLL
         might never complete even if the polled file is ready.
    
      2. When the request isn't on the waitqueue, there is no way to be
         notified that the waitqueue is being freed (which happens when its
         lifetime is shorter than the struct file's).  This is supposed to
         happen via the waitqueue entries being woken up with POLLFREE.
    
    Therefore, leave the requests on the waitqueue until they are actually
    completed (or cancelled).  To keep track of when aio_poll_complete_work
    needs to be scheduled, use new fields in struct poll_iocb.  Remove the
    'done' field which is now redundant.
    
    Note that this is consistent with how sys_poll() and eventpoll work;
    their wakeup functions do *not* remove the waitqueue entries.

    wait: add wake_up_pollfree()
    
    commit 42288cb44c4b5fff7653bc392b583a2b8bd6a8c0 upstream.
    
    Several ->poll() implementations are special in that they use a
    waitqueue whose lifetime is the current task, rather than the struct
    file as is normally the case.  This is okay for blocking polls, since a
    blocking poll occurs within one task; however, non-blocking polls
    require another solution.  This solution is for the queue to be cleared
    before it is freed, using 'wake_up_poll(wq, EPOLLHUP | POLLFREE);'.
    
    However, that has a bug: wake_up_poll() calls __wake_up() with
    nr_exclusive=1.  Therefore, if there are multiple "exclusive" waiters,
    and the wakeup function for the first one returns a positive value, only
    that one will be called.  That's *not* what's needed for POLLFREE;
    POLLFREE is special in that it really needs to wake up everyone.
    
    Considering the three non-blocking poll systems:
    
    - io_uring poll doesn't handle POLLFREE at all, so it is broken anyway.
    
    - aio poll is unaffected, since it doesn't support exclusive waits.
      However, that's fragile, as someone could add this feature later.
    
    - epoll doesn't appear to be broken by this, since its wakeup function
      returns 0 when it sees POLLFREE.  But this is fragile.
    
    Although there is a workaround (see epoll), it's better to define a
    function which always sends POLLFREE to all waiters.  Add such a
    function.  Also make it verify that the queue really becomes empty after
    all waiters have been woken up.

    x86/sme: Explicitly map new EFI memmap table as encrypted
    
    commit 1ff2fc02862d52e18fd3daabcfe840ec27e920a8 upstream.
    
    Reserving memory using efi_mem_reserve() calls into the x86
    efi_arch_mem_reserve() function. This function will insert a new EFI
    memory descriptor into the EFI memory map representing the area of
    memory to be reserved and marking it as EFI runtime memory. As part
    of adding this new entry, a new EFI memory map is allocated and mapped.
    The mapping is where a problem can occur. This new memory map is mapped
    using early_memremap() and generally mapped encrypted, unless the new
    memory for the mapping happens to come from an area of memory that is
    marked as EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_DATA memory. In this case, the new memory will
    be mapped unencrypted. However, during replacement of the old memory map,
    efi_mem_type() is disabled, so the new memory map will now be long-term
    mapped encrypted (in efi.memmap), resulting in the map containing invalid
    data and causing the kernel boot to crash.
    
    Since it is known that the area will be mapped encrypted going forward,
    explicitly map the new memory map as encrypted using early_memremap_prot().

    With the design of this driver, this condition is often triggered.

    On my system, when a CAN bus starts flapping up and down, this locks up

    drm/syncobj: Deal with signalled fences in drm_syncobj_find_fence.
    
    commit b19926d4f3a660a8b76e5d989ffd1168e619a5c4 upstream.
    
    dma_fence_chain_find_seqno only ever returns the top fence in the
    chain or an unsignalled fence. Hence if we request a seqno that
    is already signalled it returns a NULL fence. Some callers are
    not prepared to handle this, like the syncobj transfer functions
    for example.
    
    This behavior is "new" with timeline syncobj and it looks like
    not all callers were updated. To fix this behavior make sure
    that a successful drm_sync_find_fence always returns a non-NULL
    fence.
    
    v2: Move the fix to drm_syncobj_find_fence from the transfer
        functions.

    nfsd: Fix nsfd startup race (again)
    
    commit b10252c7ae9c9d7c90552f88b544a44ee773af64 upstream.
    
    Commit bd5ae9288d64 ("nfsd: register pernet ops last, unregister first")
    has re-opened rpc_pipefs_event() race against nfsd_net_id registration
    (register_pernet_subsys()) which has been fixed by commit bb7ffbf29e76
    ("nfsd: fix nsfd startup race triggering BUG_ON").
    
    Restore the order of register_pernet_subsys() vs register_cld_notifier().
    Add WARN_ON() to prevent a future regression.

    commit 8289ed9f93bef2762f9184e136d994734b16d997 upstream.
    
    I hit the BUG_ON() with generic/475 test case, and to my surprise, all
    callers of btrfs_del_root_ref() are already aborting transaction, thus
    there is not need for such BUG_ON(), just go to @out label and caller
    will properly handle the error.

    This happens because we're trying to read from a extent buffer page that
    is !PageUptodate.  This happens because we will clear the page uptodate
    when we have an IO error, but we don't clear the extent buffer uptodate.
    If we do a read later and find this extent buffer we'll think its valid
    and not return an error, and then trip over this warning.
    
    Fix this by also clearing uptodate on the extent buffer when this
    happens, so that we get an error when we do a btrfs_search_slot() and
    find this block later.

    commit 8839c8c0f77ab8fc0463f4ab8b37fca3f70677c2 upstream.
    
    Set the practical limit to the period size (the fragment shift in OSS)
    instead of a full 31bit; a too large value could lead to the exhaust
    of memory as we allocate temporary buffers of the period size, too.
    
    As of this patch, we set to 16MB limit, which should cover all use
    cases.

    commit 9d2479c960875ca1239bcb899f386970c13d9cfe upstream.
    
    The period size calculation in OSS layer may receive a negative value
    as an error, but the code there assumes only the positive values and
    handle them with size_t.  Due to that, a too big value may be passed
    to the lower layers.
    
    This patch changes the code to handle with ssize_t and adds the proper
    error checks appropriately.

    ALSA: ctl: Fix copy of updated id with element read/write
    
    commit b6409dd6bdc03aa178bbff0d80db2a30d29b63ac upstream.
    
    When control_compat.c:copy_ctl_value_to_user() is used, by
    ctl_elem_read_user() & ctl_elem_write_user(), it must also copy back the
    snd_ctl_elem_id value that may have been updated (filled in) by the call
    to snd_ctl_elem_read/snd_ctl_elem_write().
    
    This matches the functionality provided by snd_ctl_elem_read_user() and
    snd_ctl_elem_write_user(), via snd_ctl_build_ioff().
    
    Without this, and without making additional calls to snd_ctl_info()
    which are unnecessary when using the non-compat calls, a userspace
    application will not know the numid value for the element and
    consequently will not be able to use the poll/read interface on the
    control file to determine which elements have updates.

    commit 3c376dfafbf7a8ea0dea212d095ddd83e93280bb upstream.
    
    Initialize min_ratio if it is set during bdi unregistration.  This can
    prevent problems that may occur a when bdi is removed without resetting
    min_ratio.
    
    For example.
    1) insert external sdcard
    2) set external sdcard's min_ratio 70
    3) remove external sdcard without setting min_ratio 0
    4) insert external sdcard
    5) set external sdcard's min_ratio 70 << error occur(can't set)
    
    Because when an sdcard is removed, the present bdi_min_ratio value will
    remain.  Currently, the only way to reset bdi_min_ratio is to reboot.

    iavf: Fix reporting when setting descriptor count
    
    commit 1a1aa356ddf3f16539f5962c01c5f702686dfc15 upstream.
    
    iavf_set_ringparams doesn't communicate to the user that
    
    1. The user requested descriptor count is out of range. Instead it
       just quietly sets descriptors to the "clamped" value and calls it
       done. This makes it look an invalid value was successfully set as
       the descriptor count when this isn't actually true.
    
    2. The user provided descriptor count needs to be inflated for alignment
       reasons.
    
    This behavior is confusing. The ice driver has already addressed this
    by rejecting invalid values for descriptor count and
    messaging for alignment adjustments.
    Do the same thing here by adding the error and info messages.

    iavf: restore MSI state on reset
    
    commit 7e4dcc13965c57869684d57a1dc6dd7be589488c upstream.
    
    If the PF experiences an FLR, the VF's MSI and MSI-X configuration will
    be conveniently and silently removed in the process. When this happens,
    reset recovery will appear to complete normally but no traffic will
    pass. The netdev watchdog will helpfully notify everyone of this issue.
    
    To prevent such public embarrassment, restore MSI configuration at every
    reset. For normal resets, this will do no harm, but for VF resets
    resulting from a PF FLR, this will keep the VF working.

    net/ipv4/ip_input.c line 510):
    
        IPCB(skb)->iif = skb->skb_iif;
    
    If that IPv4 packet is meant to be encapsulated in an outer IPv6+SRH
    header, the seg6_do_srh_encap(...) performs the required encapsulation.
    In this case, the seg6_do_srh_encap function clears the IPv6 socket control
    block (v5.16-rc4 net/ipv6/seg6_iptunnel.c line 163):
    
        memset(IP6CB(skb), 0, sizeof(*IP6CB(skb)));
    
    The memset(...) was introduced in commit ef489749aae5 ("ipv6: sr: clear
    IP6CB(skb) on SRH ip4ip6 encapsulation") a long time ago (2019-01-29).
    
    Since the IPv6 socket control block and the IPv4 socket control block share
    the same memory area (skb->cb), the receiving interface index info is lost
    (IP6CB(skb)->iif is set to zero).
    
    As a side effect, that condition triggers a NULL pointer dereference if
    commit 0857d6f8c759 ("ipv6: When forwarding count rx stats on the orig
    netdev") is applied.
    
    To fix that issue, we set the IP6CB(skb)->iif with the index of the
    receiving interface once again.

    nfp: Fix memory leak in nfp_cpp_area_cache_add()
    
    commit c56c96303e9289cc34716b1179597b6f470833de upstream.
    
    In line 800 (#1), nfp_cpp_area_alloc() allocates and initializes a
    CPP area structure. But in line 807 (#2), when the cache is allocated
    failed, this CPP area structure is not freed, which will result in
    memory leak.
    
    We can fix it by freeing the CPP area when the cache is allocated
    failed (#2).

    ice: ignore dropped packets during init
    
    commit 28dc1b86f8ea9fd6f4c9e0b363db73ecabf84e22 upstream.
    
    If the hardware is constantly receiving unicast or broadcast packets
    during driver load, the device previously counted many GLV_RDPC (VSI
    dropped packets) events during init. This causes confusing dropped
    packet statistics during driver load. The dropped packets counter
    incrementing does stop once the driver finishes loading.
    
    Avoid this problem by baselining our statistics at the end of driver
    open instead of the end of probe.

    bpf: Fix the off-by-two error in range markings
    
    commit 2fa7d94afc1afbb4d702760c058dc2d7ed30f226 upstream.
    
    The first commit cited below attempts to fix the off-by-one error that
    appeared in some comparisons with an open range. Due to this error,
    arithmetically equivalent pieces of code could get different verdicts
    from the verifier, for example (pseudocode):
    
      // 1. Passes the verifier:
      if (data + 8 > data_end)
          return early
      read *(u64 *)data, i.e. [data; data+7]
    
      // 2. Rejected by the verifier (should still pass):
      if (data + 7 >= data_end)
          return early
      read *(u64 *)data, i.e. [data; data+7]
    
    The attempted fix, however, shifts the range by one in a wrong
    direction, so the bug not only remains, but also such piece of code
    starts failing in the verifier:
    
      // 3. Rejected by the verifier, but the check is stricter than in #1.
      if (data + 8 >= data_end)
          return early
      read *(u64 *)data, i.e. [data; data+7]
    
    The change performed by that fix converted an off-by-one bug into
    off-by-two. The second commit cited below added the BPF selftests
    written to ensure than code chunks like #3 are rejected, however,
    they should be accepted.
    
    This commit fixes the off-by-two error by adjusting new_range in the
    right direction and fixes the tests by changing the range into the
    one that should actually fail.

    vrf: don't run conntrack on vrf with !dflt qdisc
    
    commit d43b75fbc23f0ac1ef9c14a5a166d3ccb761a451 upstream.
    
    After the below patch, the conntrack attached to skb is set to "notrack" in
    the context of vrf device, for locally generated packets.
    But this is true only when the default qdisc is set to the vrf device. When
    changing the qdisc, notrack is not set anymore.
    In fact, there is a shortcut in the vrf driver, when the default qdisc is
    set, see commit dcdd43c41e60 ("net: vrf: performance improvements for
    IPv4") for more details.
    
    This patch ensures that the behavior is always the same, whatever the qdisc
    is.
    
    To demonstrate the difference, a new test is added in conntrack_vrf.sh.

    commit 33b8aad21ac175eba9577a73eb62b0aa141c241c upstream.
    
    Rework the reproducer for the vrf+conntrack regression reported
    by Eugene into a selftest and also add a test for ip masquerading
    that Lahav fixed recently.
    
    With net or net-next tree, the first test fails and the latter
    two pass.
    
    With 09e856d54bda5f28 ("vrf: Reset skb conntrack connection on VRF rcv")
    reverted first test passes but the last two fail.
    
    A proper fix needs more work, for time being a revert seems to be
    the best choice, snat/masquerade did not work before the fix.

    HID: check for valid USB device for many HID drivers
    
    commit 93020953d0fa7035fd036ad87a47ae2b7aa4ae33 upstream.
    
    Many HID drivers assume that the HID device assigned to them is a USB
    device as that was the only way HID devices used to be able to be
    created in Linux.  However, with the additional ways that HID devices
    can be created for many different bus types, that is no longer true, so
    properly check that we have a USB device associated with the HID device
    before allowing a driver that makes this assumption to claim it.

    The wacom driver accepts devices of more than just USB types, but some
    code paths can cause problems if the device being controlled is not a
    USB device due to a lack of checking.  Add the needed checks to ensure
    that the USB device accesses are only happening on a "real" USB device,
    and not one on some other bus.

    HID: bigbenff: prevent null pointer dereference
    
    commit 918aa1ef104d286d16b9e7ef139a463ac7a296f0 upstream.
    
    When emulating the device through uhid, there is a chance we don't have
    output reports and so report_field is null.

    HID: add USB_HID dependancy on some USB HID drivers
    
    commit f237d9028f844a86955fc9da59d7ac4a5c55d7d5 upstream.
    
    Some HID drivers are only for USB drivers, yet did not depend on
    CONFIG_USB_HID.  This was hidden by the fact that the USB functions were
    stubbed out in the past, but now that drivers are checking for USB
    devices properly, build errors can occur with some random
    configurations.

    HID: add USB_HID dependancy to hid-chicony
    
    commit d080811f27936f712f619f847389f403ac873b8f upstream.
    
    The chicony HID driver only controls USB devices, yet did not have a
    dependancy on USB_HID.  This causes build errors on some configurations
    like sparc when building due to new changes to the chicony driver.

    HID: add hid_is_usb() function to make it simpler for USB detection
    
    commit f83baa0cb6cfc92ebaf7f9d3a99d7e34f2e77a8a upstream.
    
    A number of HID drivers already call hid_is_using_ll_driver() but only
    for the detection of if this is a USB device or not.  Make this more
    obvious by creating hid_is_usb() and calling the function that way.
    
    Also converts the existing hid_is_using_ll_driver() functions to use the
    new call.

    HID: quirks: Add quirk for the Microsoft Surface 3 type-cover
    
    commit 9003fbe0f3674b972f56fa7e6bf3ac9dbfc4d0ec upstream.
    
    Add a HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS quirk for the
    Microsoft Surface 3 (non pro) type-cover.
    
    Trying to init the reports seems to confuse the type-cover and
    causes 2 issues:
    
    1. Despite hid-multitouch sending the command to switch the
    touchpad to multitouch mode, it keeps sending events on the
    mouse emulation interface.
    
    2. The touchpad completely stops sending events after a reboot.
    
    Adding the HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS quirk fixes both issues.

    ntfs: fix ntfs_test_inode and ntfs_init_locked_inode function type
    
    commit 1146f7e2dc15a227a7e1ef9a1fb67182b25e687f upstream.
    
    Clang's Control Flow Integrity (CFI) is a security mechanism that can help
    prevent JOP chains, deployed extensively in downstream kernels used in
    Android.
    
    Its deployment is hindered by mismatches in function signatures.  For this
    case, we make callbacks match their intended function signature, and cast
    parameters within them rather than casting the callback when passed as a
    parameter.
    
    When running `mount -t ntfs ...` we observe the following trace:

    serial: tegra: Change lower tolerance baud rate limit for tegra20 and tegra30
    
    commit b40de7469ef135161c80af0e8c462298cc5dac00 upstream.
    
    The current implementation uses 0 as lower limit for the baud rate
    tolerance for tegra20 and tegra30 chips which causes isses on UART
    initialization as soon as baud rate clock is lower than required even
    when within the standard UART tolerance of +/- 4%.
    
    This fix aligns the implementation with the initial commit description
    of +/- 4% tolerance for tegra chips other than tegra186 and
    tegra194.
