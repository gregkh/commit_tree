    staging: rtl8192e: Change state information from u16 to u8
    
    commit e78836ae76d20f38eed8c8c67f21db97529949da upstream.
    
    The "u16 CcxRmState[2];" array field in struct "rtllib_network" has 4
    bytes in total while the operations performed on this array through-out
    the code base are only 2 bytes.
    
    The "CcxRmState" field is fed only 2 bytes of data using memcpy():
    
    (In rtllib_rx.c:1972)
            memcpy(network->CcxRmState, &info_element->data[4], 2)
    
    With "info_element->data[]" being a u8 array, if 2 bytes are written
    into "CcxRmState" (whose one element is u16 size), then the 2 u8
    elements from "data[]" gets squashed and written into the first element
    ("CcxRmState[0]") while the second element ("CcxRmState[1]") is never
    fed with any data.
    
    Same in file rtllib_rx.c:2522:
             memcpy(dst->CcxRmState, src->CcxRmState, 2);
    
    The above line duplicates "src" data to "dst" but only writes 2 bytes
    (and not 4, which is the actual size). Again, only 1st element gets the
    value while the 2nd element remains uninitialized.
    
    This later makes operations done with CcxRmState unpredictable in the
    following lines as the 1st element is having a squashed number while the
    2nd element is having an uninitialized random number.
    
    rtllib_rx.c:1973:    if (network->CcxRmState[0] != 0)
    rtllib_rx.c:1977:    network->MBssidMask = network->CcxRmState[1] & 0x07;
    
    network->MBssidMask is also of type u8 and not u16.
    
    Fix this by changing the type of "CcxRmState" from u16 to u8 so that the
    data written into this array and read from it make sense and are not
    random values.
    
    NOTE: The wrong initialization of "CcxRmState" can be seen in the
    following commit:
    
    commit ecdfa44610fa ("Staging: add Realtek 8192 PCI wireless driver")
    
    The above commit created a file `rtl8192e/ieee80211.h` which used to
    have the faulty line. The file has been deleted (or possibly renamed)
    with the contents copied in to a new file `rtl8192e/rtllib.h` along with
    additional code in the commit 94a799425eee (tagged in Fixes).

    staging: rtl8192e: Fix incorrect source in memcpy()
    
    commit 72ad25fbbb78930f892b191637359ab5b94b3190 upstream.
    
    The variable "info_element" is of the following type:
    
            struct rtllib_info_element *info_element
    
    defined in drivers/staging/rtl8192e/rtllib.h:
    
            struct rtllib_info_element {
                    u8 id;
                    u8 len;
                    u8 data[];
            } __packed;
    
    The "len" field defines the size of the "data[]" array. The code is
    supposed to check if "info_element->len" is greater than 4 and later
    equal to 6. If this is satisfied then, the last two bytes (the 4th and
    5th element of u8 "data[]" array) are copied into "network->CcxRmState".
    
    Right now the code uses "memcpy()" with the source as "&info_element[4]"
    which would copy in wrong and unintended information. The struct
    "rtllib_info_element" has a size of 2 bytes for "id" and "len",
    therefore indexing will be done in interval of 2 bytes. So,
    "info_element[4]" would point to data which is beyond the memory
    allocated for this pointer (that is, at x+8, while "info_element" has
    been allocated only from x to x+7 (2 + 6 => 8 bytes)).
    
    This patch rectifies this error by using "&info_element->data[4]" which
    correctly copies the last two bytes of "data[]".
    
    NOTE: The faulty line of code came from the following commit:
    
    commit ecdfa44610fa ("Staging: add Realtek 8192 PCI wireless driver")
    
    The above commit created the file `rtl8192e/ieee80211/ieee80211_rx.c`
    which had the faulty line of code. This file has been deleted (or
    possibly renamed) with the contents copied in to a new file
    `rtl8192e/rtllib_rx.c` along with additional code in the commit
    94a799425eee (tagged in Fixes).

    commit 72035f4954f0bca2d8c47cf31b3629c42116f5b7 upstream.
    
    init_dma_pools() calls dma_pool_create(...dev->dev) to create dma pool.
    however, dev->dev is actually set after calling init_dma_pools(), which
    effectively makes dma_pool_create(..NULL) and cause crash.
    To fix this issue, init dma only after dev->dev is set.

    If tty-device registration fails the driver would fail to release the
    data interface. When the device is later disconnected, the disconnect
    callback would still be called for the data interface and would go about
    releasing already freed resources.

    commit 08dff274edda54310d6f1cf27b62fddf0f8d146e upstream.
    
    Counting break events is nice but we should actually report them to
    the tty layer.

    USB: quirks: ignore remote wake-up on Fibocom L850-GL LTE modem
    
    commit 0bd860493f81eb2a46173f6f5e44cc38331c8dbd upstream.
    
    This LTE modem (M.2 card) has a bug in its power management:
    there is some kind of race condition for U3 wake-up between the host and
    the device. The modem firmware sometimes crashes/locks when both events
    happen at the same time and the modem fully drops off the USB bus (and
    sometimes re-enumerates, sometimes just gets stuck until the next
    reboot).
    
    Tested with the modem wired to the XHCI controller on an AMD 3015Ce
    platform. Without the patch, the modem dropped of the USB bus 5 times in
    3 days. With the quirk, it stayed connected for a week while the
    'runtime_suspended_time' counter incremented as excepted.

    firewire: nosy: Fix a use-after-free bug in nosy_ioctl()
    
    [ Upstream commit 829933ef05a951c8ff140e814656d73e74915faf ]
    
    For each device, the nosy driver allocates a pcilynx structure.
    A use-after-free might happen in the following scenario:
    
     1. Open nosy device for the first time and call ioctl with command
        NOSY_IOC_START, then a new client A will be malloced and added to
        doubly linked list.
     2. Open nosy device for the second time and call ioctl with command
        NOSY_IOC_START, then a new client B will be malloced and added to
        doubly linked list.
     3. Call ioctl with command NOSY_IOC_START for client A, then client A
        will be readded to the doubly linked list. Now the doubly linked
        list is messed up.
     4. Close the first nosy device and nosy_release will be called. In
        nosy_release, client A will be unlinked and freed.
     5. Close the second nosy device, and client A will be referenced,
        resulting in UAF.
    
    The root cause of this bug is that the element in the doubly linked list
    is reentered into the list.
    
    Fix this bug by adding a check before inserting a client.  If a client
    is already in the linked list, don't insert it.
    
    The following KASAN report reveals it:

    reiserfs: update reiserfs_xattrs_initialized() condition
    
    commit 5e46d1b78a03d52306f21f77a4e4a144b6d31486 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting NULL pointer dereference at reiserfs_security_init()
    [1], for commit ab17c4f02156c4f7 ("reiserfs: fixup xattr_root caching")
    is assuming that REISERFS_SB(s)->xattr_root != NULL in
    reiserfs_xattr_jcreate_nblocks() despite that commit made
    REISERFS_SB(sb)->priv_root != NULL && REISERFS_SB(s)->xattr_root == NULL
    case possible.
    
    I guess that commit 6cb4aff0a77cc0e6 ("reiserfs: fix oops while creating
    privroot with selinux enabled") wanted to check xattr_root != NULL
    before reiserfs_xattr_jcreate_nblocks(), for the changelog is talking
    about the xattr root.
    
      The issue is that while creating the privroot during mount
      reiserfs_security_init calls reiserfs_xattr_jcreate_nblocks which
      dereferences the xattr root. The xattr root doesn't exist, so we get
      an oops.
    
    Therefore, update reiserfs_xattrs_initialized() to check both the
    privroot and the xattr root.

    mm: fix race by making init_zero_pfn() early_initcall
    
    commit e720e7d0e983bf05de80b231bccc39f1487f0f16 upstream.
    
    There are code paths that rely on zero_pfn to be fully initialized
    before core_initcall.  For example, wq_sysfs_init() is a core_initcall
    function that eventually results in a call to kernel_execve, which
    causes a page fault with a subsequent mmput.  If zero_pfn is not
    initialized by then it may not get cleaned up properly and result in an
    error:
    
      BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:(ptrval) type:MM_ANONPAGES val:1
    
    Here is an analysis of the race as seen on a MIPS device. On this
    particular MT7621 device (Ubiquiti ER-X), zero_pfn is PFN 0 until
    initialized, at which point it becomes PFN 5120:
    
      1. wq_sysfs_init calls into kobject_uevent_env at core_initcall:
           kobject_uevent_env+0x7e4/0x7ec
           kset_register+0x68/0x88
           bus_register+0xdc/0x34c
           subsys_virtual_register+0x34/0x78
           wq_sysfs_init+0x1c/0x4c
           do_one_initcall+0x50/0x1a8
           kernel_init_freeable+0x230/0x2c8
           kernel_init+0x10/0x100
           ret_from_kernel_thread+0x14/0x1c
    
      2. kobject_uevent_env() calls call_usermodehelper_exec() which executes
         kernel_execve asynchronously.
    
      3. Memory allocations in kernel_execve cause a page fault, bumping the
         MM reference counter:
           add_mm_counter_fast+0xb4/0xc0
           handle_mm_fault+0x6e4/0xea0
           __get_user_pages.part.78+0x190/0x37c
           __get_user_pages_remote+0x128/0x360
           get_arg_page+0x34/0xa0
           copy_string_kernel+0x194/0x2a4
           kernel_execve+0x11c/0x298
           call_usermodehelper_exec_async+0x114/0x194
    
      4. In case zero_pfn has not been initialized yet, zap_pte_range does
         not decrement the MM_ANONPAGES RSS counter and the BUG message is
         triggered shortly afterwards when __mmdrop checks the ref counters:
           __mmdrop+0x98/0x1d0
           free_bprm+0x44/0x118
           kernel_execve+0x160/0x1d8
           call_usermodehelper_exec_async+0x114/0x194
           ret_from_kernel_thread+0x14/0x1c
    
    To avoid races such as described above, initialize init_zero_pfn at
    early_initcall level.  Depending on the architecture, ZERO_PAGE is
    either constant or gets initialized even earlier, at paging_init, so
    there is no issue with initializing zero_pfn earlier.

    tracing: Fix stack trace event size
    
    commit 9deb193af69d3fd6dd8e47f292b67c805a787010 upstream.
    
    Commit cbc3b92ce037 fixed an issue to modify the macros of the stack trace
    event so that user space could parse it properly. Originally the stack
    trace format to user space showed that the called stack was a dynamic
    array. But it is not actually a dynamic array, in the way that other
    dynamic event arrays worked, and this broke user space parsing for it. The
    update was to make the array look to have 8 entries in it. Helper
    functions were added to make it parse it correctly, as the stack was
    dynamic, but was determined by the size of the event stored.
    
    Although this fixed user space on how it read the event, it changed the
    internal structure used for the stack trace event. It changed the array
    size from [0] to [8] (added 8 entries). This increased the size of the
    stack trace event by 8 words. The size reserved on the ring buffer was the
    size of the stack trace event plus the number of stack entries found in
    the stack trace. That commit caused the amount to be 8 more than what was
    needed because it did not expect the caller field to have any size. This
    produced 8 entries of garbage (and reading random data) from the stack
    trace event:
    
              <idle>-0       [002] d... 1976396.837549: <stack trace>
     => trace_event_raw_event_sched_switch
     => __traceiter_sched_switch
     => __schedule
     => schedule_idle
     => do_idle
     => cpu_startup_entry
     => secondary_startup_64_no_verify
     => 0xc8c5e150ffff93de
     => 0xffff93de
     => 0
     => 0
     => 0xc8c5e17800000000
     => 0x1f30affff93de
     => 0x00000004
     => 0x200000000
    
    Instead, subtract the size of the caller field from the size of the event
    to make sure that only the amount needed to store the stack trace is
    reserved.

    PM: runtime: Fix race getting/putting suppliers at probe
    
    commit 9dfacc54a8661bc8be6e08cffee59596ec59f263 upstream.
    
    pm_runtime_put_suppliers() must not decrement rpm_active unless the
    consumer is suspended. That is because, otherwise, it could suspend
    suppliers for an active consumer.
    
    That can happen as follows:
    
     static int driver_probe_device(struct device_driver *drv, struct device *dev)
     {
            int ret = 0;
    
            if (!device_is_registered(dev))
                    return -ENODEV;
    
            dev->can_match = true;
            pr_debug("bus: '%s': %s: matched device %s with driver %s\n",
                     drv->bus->name, __func__, dev_name(dev), drv->name);
    
            pm_runtime_get_suppliers(dev);
            if (dev->parent)
                    pm_runtime_get_sync(dev->parent);
    
     At this point, dev can runtime suspend so rpm_put_suppliers() can run,
     rpm_active becomes 1 (the lowest value).
    
            pm_runtime_barrier(dev);
            if (initcall_debug)
                    ret = really_probe_debug(dev, drv);
            else
                    ret = really_probe(dev, drv);
    
     Probe callback can have runtime resumed dev, and then runtime put
     so dev is awaiting autosuspend, but rpm_active is 2.
    
            pm_request_idle(dev);
    
            if (dev->parent)
                    pm_runtime_put(dev->parent);
    
            pm_runtime_put_suppliers(dev);
    
     Now pm_runtime_put_suppliers() will put the supplier
     i.e. rpm_active 2 -> 1, but consumer can still be active.
    
            return ret;
     }
    
    Fix by checking the runtime status. For any status other than
    RPM_SUSPENDED, rpm_active can be considered to be "owned" by
    rpm_[get/put]_suppliers() and pm_runtime_put_suppliers() need do nothing.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: call alc_update_headset_mode() in hp_automute_hook
    
    commit e54f30befa7990b897189b44a56c1138c6bfdbb5 upstream.
    
    We found the alc_update_headset_mode() is not called on some machines
    when unplugging the headset, as a result, the mode of the
    ALC_HEADSET_MODE_UNPLUGGED can't be set, then the current_headset_type
    is not cleared, if users plug a differnt type of headset next time,
    the determine_headset_type() will not be called and the audio jack is
    set to the headset type of previous time.
    
    On the Dell machines which connect the dmic to the PCH, if we open
    the gnome-sound-setting and unplug the headset, this issue will
    happen. Those machines disable the auto-mute by ucm and has no
    internal mic in the input source, so the update_headset_mode() will
    not be called by cap_sync_hook or automute_hook when unplugging, and
    because the gnome-sound-setting is opened, the codec will not enter
    the runtime_suspend state, so the update_headset_mode() will not be
    called by alc_resume when unplugging. In this case the
    hp_automute_hook is called when unplugging, so add
    update_headset_mode() calling to this function.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: fix a determine_headset_type issue for a Dell AIO
    
    commit febf22565549ea7111e7d45e8f2d64373cc66b11 upstream.
    
    We found a recording issue on a Dell AIO, users plug a headset-mic and
    select headset-mic from UI, but can't record any sound from
    headset-mic. The root cause is the determine_headset_type() returns a
    wrong type, e.g. users plug a ctia type headset, but that function
    returns omtp type.
    
    On this machine, the internal mic is not connected to the codec, the
    "Input Source" is headset mic by default. And when users plug a
    headset, the determine_headset_type() will be called immediately, the
    codec on this AIO is alc274, the delay time for this codec in the
    determine_headset_type() is only 80ms, the delay is too short to
    correctly determine the headset type, the fail rate is nearly 99% when
    users plug the headset with the normal speed.
    
    Other codecs set several hundred ms delay time, so here I change the
    delay time to 850ms for alc2x4 series, after this change, the fail
    rate is zero unless users plug the headset slowly on purpose.

    bpf: Remove MTU check in __bpf_skb_max_len
    
    commit 6306c1189e77a513bf02720450bb43bd4ba5d8ae upstream.
    
    Multiple BPF-helpers that can manipulate/increase the size of the SKB uses
    __bpf_skb_max_len() as the max-length. This function limit size against
    the current net_device MTU (skb->dev->mtu).
    
    When a BPF-prog grow the packet size, then it should not be limited to the
    MTU. The MTU is a transmit limitation, and software receiving this packet
    should be allowed to increase the size. Further more, current MTU check in
    __bpf_skb_max_len uses the MTU from ingress/current net_device, which in
    case of redirects uses the wrong net_device.
    
    This patch keeps a sanity max limit of SKB_MAX_ALLOC (16KiB). The real limit
    is elsewhere in the system. Jesper's testing[1] showed it was not possible
    to exceed 8KiB when expanding the SKB size via BPF-helper. The limiting
    factor is the define KMALLOC_MAX_CACHE_SIZE which is 8192 for
    SLUB-allocator (CONFIG_SLUB) in-case PAGE_SIZE is 4096. This define is
    in-effect due to this being called from softirq context see code
    __gfp_pfmemalloc_flags() and __do_kmalloc_node(). Jakub's testing showed
    that frames above 16KiB can cause NICs to reset (but not crash). Keep this
    sanity limit at this level as memory layer can differ based on kernel
    config.

    [ Upstream commit 62e69bc419772638369eff8ff81340bde8aceb61 ]
    
    lmc set sc->lmc_media pointer when there is a matching device.
    However, when no matching device is found, this pointer is NULL
    and the following dereference will result in a null-ptr-deref.

    appletalk: Fix skb allocation size in loopback case
    
    [ Upstream commit 39935dccb21c60f9bbf1bb72d22ab6fd14ae7705 ]
    
    If a DDP broadcast packet is sent out to a non-gateway target, it is
    also looped back. There is a potential for the loopback device to have a
    longer hardware header length than the original target route's device,
    which can result in the skb not being created with enough room for the
    loopback device's hardware header. This patch fixes the issue by
    determining that a loopback will be necessary prior to allocating the
    skb, and if so, ensuring the skb has enough room.
    
    This was discovered while testing a new driver that creates a LocalTalk
    network interface (LTALK_HLEN = 1). It caused an skb_under_panic.

    The aq_nic_start function can fail in a variety of cases which leaves
    the device in broken state.
    
    An example case where the start function fails is the
    request_threaded_irq which can be interrupted, resulting in a EINTR
    result. This can be manually triggered by bringing the link up (e.g. ip
    link set up) and triggering a SIGINT on the initiating process (e.g.
    Ctrl+C). This would put the device into a half configured state.
    Subsequently bringing the link up again would cause the napi_enable to
    BUG.
    
    In order to correctly clean up the failed attempt to start a device call
    aq_nic_stop.

    ath10k: hold RCU lock when calling ieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr()
    
    [ Upstream commit 09078368d516918666a0122f2533dc73676d3d7e ]
    
    ieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr() must be called under the RCU lock and
    the resulting pointer is only valid under RCU lock as well.
    
    Fix ath10k_wmi_tlv_op_pull_peer_stats_info() to hold RCU lock before it
    calls ieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr() and release it when the resulting
    pointer is no longer needed.
    
    This problem was found while reviewing code to debug RCU warn from
    ath10k_wmi_tlv_parse_peer_stats_info().

    brcmfmac: clear EAP/association status bits on linkdown events
    
    [ Upstream commit e862a3e4088070de352fdafe9bd9e3ae0a95a33c ]
    
    This ensure that previous association attempts do not leave stale statuses
    on subsequent attempts.
    
    This fixes the WARN_ON(!cr->bss)) from __cfg80211_connect_result() when
    connecting to an AP after a previous connection failure (e.g. where EAP fails
    due to incorrect psk but association succeeded). In some scenarios, indeed,
    brcmf_is_linkup() was reporting a link up event too early due to stale
    BRCMF_VIF_STATUS_ASSOC_SUCCESS bit, thus reporting to cfg80211 a connection
    result with a zeroed bssid (vif->profile.bssid is still empty), causing the
    WARN_ON due to the call to cfg80211_get_bss() with the empty bssid.

    ext4: do not iput inode under running transaction in ext4_rename()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dccdc5a1916d4266edd251f20bbbb113a5c495f ]
    
    In ext4_rename(), when RENAME_WHITEOUT failed to add new entry into
    directory, it ends up dropping new created whiteout inode under the
    running transaction. After commit <9b88f9fb0d2> ("ext4: Do not iput inode
    under running transaction"), we follow the assumptions that evict() does
    not get called from a transaction context but in ext4_rename() it breaks
    this suggestion. Although it's not a real problem, better to obey it, so
    this patch add inode to orphan list and stop transaction before final
    iput().

    locking/ww_mutex: Simplify use_ww_ctx & ww_ctx handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 5de2055d31ea88fd9ae9709ac95c372a505a60fa ]
    
    The use_ww_ctx flag is passed to mutex_optimistic_spin(), but the
    function doesn't use it. The frequent use of the (use_ww_ctx && ww_ctx)
    combination is repetitive.
    
    In fact, ww_ctx should not be used at all if !use_ww_ctx.  Simplify
    ww_mutex code by dropping use_ww_ctx from mutex_optimistic_spin() an
    clear ww_ctx if !use_ww_ctx. In this way, we can replace (use_ww_ctx &&
    ww_ctx) by just (ww_ctx).

    thermal/core: Add NULL pointer check before using cooling device stats
    
    [ Upstream commit 2046a24ae121cd107929655a6aaf3b8c5beea01f ]
    
    There is a possible chance that some cooling device stats buffer
    allocation fails due to very high cooling device max state value.
    Later cooling device update sysfs can try to access stats data
    for the same cooling device. It will lead to NULL pointer
    dereference issue.
    
    Add a NULL pointer check before accessing thermal cooling device
    stats data. It fixes the following bug

    vhost: Fix vhost_vq_reset()
    
    [ Upstream commit beb691e69f4dec7bfe8b81b509848acfd1f0dbf9 ]
    
    vhost_reset_is_le() is vhost_init_is_le(), and in the case of
    cross-endian legacy, vhost_init_is_le() depends on vq->user_be.
    
    vq->user_be is set by vhost_disable_cross_endian().
    
    But in vhost_vq_reset(), we have:
    
        vhost_reset_is_le(vq);
        vhost_disable_cross_endian(vq);
    
    And so user_be is used before being set.
    
    To fix that, reverse the lines order as there is no other dependency
    between them.

    | BITS  | FIELD       | RW | RESET | DEFINITION                        |
    | 15    | RSVD        | RO | 0x0   | Reserved                          |
    | 14    | RSVD        | RW | 0x1   | Reserved                          |
    | 13:12 | MAX_GAIN    | RW | 0x1   | Max Gain of AVC in expander mode  |
    | 11:10 | RSVD        | RO | 0x0   | Reserved                          |
    | 9:8   | LBI_RESP    | RW | 0x1   | Integrator Response               |
    | 7:6   | RSVD        | RO | 0x0   | Reserved                          |
    | 5     | HARD_LMT_EN | RW | 0x0   | Enable hard limiter mode          |
    | 4:1   | RSVD        | RO | 0x0   | Reserved                          |
    | 0     | EN          | RW | 0x0   | Enable/Disable AVC                |
    
    The original default value written to the DAP_AVC_CTRL register during
    sgtl5000_i2c_probe() was 0x0510.  This would incorrectly write values to
    bits 4 and 10, which are defined as RESERVED.  It would also not set
    bits 12 and 14 to their correct RESET values of 0x1, and instead set
    them to 0x0.  While the DAP_AVC module is effectively disabled because
    the EN bit is 0, this default value is still writing invalid values to
    registers that are marked as read-only and RESERVED as well as not
    setting bits 12 and 14 to their correct default values as defined by the
    datasheet.
    
    The correct value that should be written to the DAP_AVC_CTRL register is
    0x5100, which configures the register bits to the default values defined
    by the datasheet, and prevents any writes to bits defined as
    'read-only'.  Generally speaking, it is best practice to NOT attempt to
    write values to registers/bits defined as RESERVED, as it generally
    produces unwanted/undefined behavior, or errors.
    
    Also, all credit for this patch should go to my colleague Dan MacDonald
    <dmacdonald@curbellmedical.com> for finding this error in the first
    place.

    ASoC: rt5651: Fix dac- and adc- vol-tlv values being off by a factor of 10
    
    [ Upstream commit eee51df776bd6cac10a76b2779a9fdee3f622b2b ]
    
    The adc_vol_tlv volume-control has a range from -17.625 dB to +30 dB,
    not -176.25 dB to + 300 dB. This wrong scale is esp. a problem in userspace
    apps which translate the dB scale to a linear scale. With the logarithmic
    dB scale being of by a factor of 10 we loose all precision in the lower
    area of the range when apps translate things to a linear scale.
    
    E.g. the 0 dB default, which corresponds with a value of 47 of the
    0 - 127 range for the control, would be shown as 0/100 in alsa-mixer.
    
    Since the centi-dB values used in the TLV struct cannot represent the
    0.375 dB step size used by these controls, change the TLV definition
    for them to specify a min and max value instead of min + stepsize.
    
    Note this mirrors commit 3f31f7d9b540 ("ASoC: rt5670: Fix dac- and adc-
    vol-tlv values being off by a factor of 10") which made the exact same
    change to the rt5670 codec driver.

    rpc: fix NULL dereference on kmalloc failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ddc942394013f08992fc379ca04cffacbbe3dae ]
    
    I think this is unlikely but possible:
    
    svc_authenticate sets rq_authop and calls svcauth_gss_accept.  The
    kmalloc(sizeof(*svcdata), GFP_KERNEL) fails, leaving rq_auth_data NULL,
    and returning SVC_DENIED.
    
    This causes svc_process_common to go to err_bad_auth, and eventually
    call svc_authorise.  That calls ->release == svcauth_gss_release, which
    tries to dereference rq_auth_data.

    ipv6: weaken the v4mapped source check
    
    [ Upstream commit dcc32f4f183ab8479041b23a1525d48233df1d43 ]
    
    This reverts commit 6af1799aaf3f1bc8defedddfa00df3192445bbf3.
    
    Commit 6af1799aaf3f ("ipv6: drop incoming packets having a v4mapped
    source address") introduced an input check against v4mapped addresses.
    Use of such addresses on the wire is indeed questionable and not
    allowed on public Internet. As the commit pointed out
    
      https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-itojun-v6ops-v4mapped-harmful-02
    
    lists potential issues.
    
    Unfortunately there are applications which use v4mapped addresses,
    and breaking them is a clear regression. For example v4mapped
    addresses (or any semi-valid addresses, really) may be used
    for uni-direction event streams or packet export.
    
    Since the issue which sparked the addition of the check was with
    TCP and request_socks in particular push the check down to TCPv6
    and DCCP. This restores the ability to receive UDPv6 packets with
    v4mapped address as the source.
    
    Keep using the IPSTATS_MIB_INHDRERRORS statistic to minimize the
    user-visible changes.

    tcp: relookup sock for RST+ACK packets handled by obsolete req sock
    
    commit 7233da86697efef41288f8b713c10c2499cffe85 upstream.
    
    Currently tcp_check_req can be called with obsolete req socket for which big
    socket have been already created (because of CPU race or early demux
    assigning req socket to multiple packets in gro batch).
    
    Commit e0f9759f530bf789e984 ("tcp: try to keep packet if SYN_RCV race
    is lost") added retry in case when tcp_check_req is called for PSH|ACK packet.
    But if client sends RST+ACK immediatly after connection being
    established (it is performing healthcheck, for example) retry does not
    occur. In that case tcp_check_req tries to close req socket,
    leaving big socket active.

    selinux: vsock: Set SID for socket returned by accept()
    
    [ Upstream commit 1f935e8e72ec28dddb2dc0650b3b6626a293d94b ]
    
    For AF_VSOCK, accept() currently returns sockets that are unlabelled.
    Other socket families derive the child's SID from the SID of the parent
    and the SID of the incoming packet. This is typically done as the
    connected socket is placed in the queue that accept() removes from.
    
    Reuse the existing 'security_sk_clone' hook to copy the SID from the
    parent (server) socket to the child. There is no packet SID in this
    case.
