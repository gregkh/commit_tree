    mac80211: Do not use stack memory with scatterlist for GMAC
    
    commit a71fd9dac23613d96ba3c05619a8ef4fd6cdf9b9 upstream.
    
    ieee80211_aes_gmac() uses the mic argument directly in sg_set_buf() and
    that does not allow use of stack memory (e.g., BUG_ON() is hit in
    sg_set_buf() with CONFIG_DEBUG_SG). BIP GMAC TX side is fine for this
    since it can use the skb data buffer, but the RX side was using a stack
    variable for deriving the local MIC value to compare against the
    received one.
    
    Fix this by allocating heap memory for the mic buffer.
    
    This was found with hwsim test case ap_cipher_bip_gmac_128 hitting that
    BUG_ON() and kernel panic.

    mac80211: handle deauthentication/disassociation from TDLS peer
    
    commit 79c92ca42b5a3e0ea172ea2ce8df8e125af237da upstream.
    
    When receiving a deauthentication/disassociation frame from a TDLS
    peer, a station should not disconnect the current AP, but only
    disable the current TDLS link if it's enabled.
    
    Without this change, a TDLS issue can be reproduced by following the
    steps as below:
    
    1. STA-1 and STA-2 are connected to AP, bidirection traffic is running
       between STA-1 and STA-2.
    2. Set up TDLS link between STA-1 and STA-2, stay for a while, then
       teardown TDLS link.
    3. Repeat step #2 and monitor the connection between STA and AP.
    
    During the test, one STA may send a deauthentication/disassociation
    frame to another, after TDLS teardown, with reason code 6/7, which
    means: Class 2/3 frame received from nonassociated STA.
    
    On receive this frame, the receiver STA will disconnect the current
    AP and then reconnect. It's not a expected behavior, purpose of this
    frame should be disabling the TDLS link, not the link with AP.

    Bluetooth: Fix regression with minimum encryption key size alignment
    
    commit 693cd8ce3f882524a5d06f7800dd8492411877b3 upstream.
    
    When trying to align the minimum encryption key size requirement for
    Bluetooth connections, it turns out doing this in a central location in
    the HCI connection handling code is not possible.
    
    Original Bluetooth version up to 2.0 used a security model where the
    L2CAP service would enforce authentication and encryption.  Starting
    with Bluetooth 2.1 and Secure Simple Pairing that model has changed into
    that the connection initiator is responsible for providing an encrypted
    ACL link before any L2CAP communication can happen.
    
    Now connecting Bluetooth 2.1 or later devices with Bluetooth 2.0 and
    before devices are causing a regression.  The encryption key size check
    needs to be moved out of the HCI connection handling into the L2CAP
    channel setup.
    
    To achieve this, the current check inside hci_conn_security() has been
    moved into l2cap_check_enc_key_size() helper function and then called
    from four decisions point inside L2CAP to cover all combinations of
    Secure Simple Pairing enabled devices and device using legacy pairing
    and legacy service security model.

    ARM: dts: am57xx-idk: Remove support for voltage switching for SD card
    
    commit 88a748419b84187fd1da05637b8e5928b04a1e06 upstream.
    
    If UHS speed modes are enabled, a compatible SD card switches down to
    1.8V during enumeration. If after this a software reboot/crash takes
    place and on-chip ROM tries to enumerate the SD card, the difference in
    IO voltages (host @ 3.3V and card @ 1.8V) may end up damaging the card.
    
    The fix for this is to have support for power cycling the card in
    hardware (with a PORz/soft-reset line causing a power cycle of the
    card). Since am571x-, am572x- and am574x-idk don't have this
    capability, disable voltage switching for these boards.
    
    The major effect of this is that the maximum supported speed
    mode is now high speed(50 MHz) down from SDR104(200 MHz).

    ARM: imx: cpuidle-imx6sx: Restrict the SW2ISO increase to i.MX6SX
    
    commit b25af2ff7c07bd19af74e3f64ff82e2880d13d81 upstream.
    
    Since commit 1e434b703248 ("ARM: imx: update the cpu power up timing
    setting on i.mx6sx") some characters loss is noticed on i.MX6ULL UART
    as reported by Christoph Niedermaier.
    
    The intention of such commit was to increase the SW2ISO field for i.MX6SX
    only, but since cpuidle-imx6sx is also used on i.MX6UL/i.MX6ULL this caused
    unintended side effects on other SoCs.
    
    Fix this problem by keeping the original SW2ISO value for i.MX6UL/i.MX6ULL
    and only increase SW2ISO in the i.MX6SX case.

    can: flexcan: fix timeout when set small bitrate
    
    commit 247e5356a709eb49a0d95ff2a7f07dac05c8252c upstream.
    
    Current we can meet timeout issue when setting a small bitrate like
    10000 as follows on i.MX6UL EVK board (ipg clock = 66MHZ, per clock =
    30MHZ):
    
    | root@imx6ul7d:~# ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 10000
    
    A link change request failed with some changes committed already.
    Interface can0 may have been left with an inconsistent configuration,
    please check.
    
    | RTNETLINK answers: Connection timed out
    
    It is caused by calling of flexcan_chip_unfreeze() timeout.
    
    Originally the code is using usleep_range(10, 20) for unfreeze
    operation, but the patch (8badd65 can: flexcan: avoid calling
    usleep_range from interrupt context) changed it into udelay(10) which is
    only a half delay of before, there're also some other delay changes.
    
    After double to FLEXCAN_TIMEOUT_US to 100 can fix the issue.
    
    Meanwhile, Rasmus Villemoes reported that even with a timeout of 100,
    flexcan_probe() fails on the MPC8309, which requires a value of at least
    140 to work reliably. 250 works for everyone.

    hwmon: (pmbus/core) Treat parameters as paged if on multiple pages
    
    [ Upstream commit 4a60570dce658e3f8885bbcf852430b99f65aca5 ]
    
    Some chips have attributes which exist on more than one page but the
    attribute is not presently marked as paged. This causes the attributes
    to be generated with the same label, which makes it impossible for
    userspace to tell them apart.
    
    Marking all such attributes as paged would result in the page suffix
    being added regardless of whether they were present on more than one
    page or not, which might break existing setups. Therefore, we add a
    second check which treats the attribute as paged, even if not marked as
    such, if it is present on multiple pages.

    hwmon: (core) add thermal sensors only if dev->of_node is present
    
    [ Upstream commit c41dd48e21fae3e55b3670ccf2eb562fc1f6a67d ]
    
    Drivers may register to hwmon and request for also registering
    with the thermal subsystem (HWMON_C_REGISTER_TZ). However,
    some of these driver, e.g. marvell phy, may be probed from
    Device Tree or being dynamically allocated, and in the later
    case, it will not have a dev->of_node entry.
    
    Registering with hwmon without the dev->of_node may result in
    different outcomes depending on the device tree, which may
    be a bit misleading. If the device tree blob has no 'thermal-zones'
    node, the *hwmon_device_register*() family functions are going
    to gracefully succeed, because of-thermal,
    *thermal_zone_of_sensor_register() return -ENODEV in this case,
    and the hwmon error path handles this error code as success to
    cover for the case where CONFIG_THERMAL_OF is not set.
    However, if the device tree blob has the 'thermal-zones'
    entry, the *hwmon_device_register*() will always fail on callers
    with no dev->of_node, propagating -EINVAL.
    
    If dev->of_node is not present, calling of-thermal does not
    make sense. For this reason, this patch checks first if the
    device has a of_node before going over the process of registering
    with the thermal subsystem of-thermal interface. And in this case,
    when a caller of *hwmon_device_register*() with HWMON_C_REGISTER_TZ
    and no dev->of_node will still register with hwmon, but not with
    the thermal subsystem. If all the hwmon part bits are in place,
    the registration will succeed.

    s390/qeth: fix VLAN attribute in bridge_hostnotify udev event
    
    [ Upstream commit 335726195e460cb6b3f795b695bfd31f0ea70ef0 ]
    
    Enabling sysfs attribute bridge_hostnotify triggers a series of udev events
    for the MAC addresses of all currently connected peers. In case no VLAN is
    set for a peer, the device reports the corresponding MAC addresses with
    VLAN ID 4096. This currently results in attribute VLAN=4096 for all
    non-VLAN interfaces in the initial series of events after host-notify is
    enabled.
    
    Instead, no VLAN attribute should be reported in the udev event for
    non-VLAN interfaces.
    
    Only the initial events face this issue. For dynamic changes that are
    reported later, the device uses a validity flag.
    
    This also changes the code so that it now sets the VLAN attribute for
    MAC addresses with VID 0. On Linux, no qeth interface will ever be
    registered with VID 0: Linux kernel registers VID 0 on all network
    interfaces initially, but qeth will drop .ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid for VID 0.
    Peers with other OSs could register MACs with VID 0.

    net: ipvlan: Fix ipvlan device tso disabled while NETIF_F_IP_CSUM is set
    
    [ Upstream commit ceae266bf0ae6564ac16d086bf749a096fa90ded ]
    
    There's some NICs, such as hinic, with NETIF_F_IP_CSUM and NETIF_F_TSO
    on but NETIF_F_HW_CSUM off. And ipvlan device features will be
    NETIF_F_TSO on with NETIF_F_IP_CSUM and NETIF_F_IP_CSUM both off as
    IPVLAN_FEATURES only care about NETIF_F_HW_CSUM. So TSO will be
    disabled in netdev_fix_features.
    For example:
    Features for enp129s0f0:
    rx-checksumming: on
    tx-checksumming: on
            tx-checksum-ipv4: on
            tx-checksum-ip-generic: off [fixed]

    drm/arm/hdlcd: Allow a bit of clock tolerance
    
    [ Upstream commit 1c810739097fdeb31b393b67a0a1e3d7ffdd9f63 ]
    
    On the Arm Juno platform, the HDLCD pixel clock is constrained to 250KHz
    resolution in order to avoid the tiny System Control Processor spending
    aeons trying to calculate exact PLL coefficients. This means that modes
    like my oddball 1600x1200 with 130.89MHz clock get rejected since the
    rate cannot be matched exactly. In practice, though, this mode works
    quite happily with the clock at 131MHz, so let's relax the check to
    allow a little bit of slop.

    Rather than allowing any old mode through, then subsequently refusing
    unmatchable clock rates in atomic_check when it's too late to back out
    and pick a different mode, let's do that validation up-front where it
    will cause unsupported modes to be correctly pruned in the first place.
    
    This also eliminates an issue whereby a perceived clock rate of 0 would
    cause atomic disable to fail and prevent the module from being unloaded.

    The PERF_EVENT_IOC_PERIOD ioctl command can be used to change the
    sample period of a running perf_event. Consequently, when calculating
    the next event period, the new period will only be considered after the
    previous one has overflowed.
    
    This patch changes the calculation of the remaining event ticks so that
    they are offset if the period has changed.

    message is logged:
    
    failed to kill vid 0081/0 for device eth_cu_1000_4
    
    This is caused by call from __vlan_vid_del() with vin set to zero, over
    call chain this results into _mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_del() called with
    vid=0, and mv88e6xxx_vtu_get() called from there returns -EINVAL.
    
    On symmetric path moving port up, call goes through
    mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_prepare() that calls mv88e6xxx_port_check_hw_vlan()
    that returns -EOPNOTSUPP for zero vid.
    
    This patch changes mv88e6xxx_vtu_get() to also return -EOPNOTSUPP for
    zero vid, then this error code is explicitly cleared in
    dsa_slave_vlan_rx_kill_vid() and error message is no longer logged.

    [ Upstream commit 2abae62a26a265129b364d8c1ef3be55e2c01309 ]
    
    The qpn allocation logic has a WARN_ON() that intends to detect the use of
    an index that will introduce bits in the lower order bits of the QOS bits
    in the QPN.
    
    Unfortunately, it has the following bugs:
    - it misfires when wrapping QPN allocation for non-QOS
    - it doesn't correctly detect low order QOS bits (despite the comment)
    
    The WARN_ON() should not be applied to non-QOS (qos_shift == 1).
    
    Additionally, it SHOULD test the qpn bits per the table below:
    
    2 data VLs:   [qp7, qp6, qp5, qp4, qp3, qp2, qp1] ^
                  [  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0, sc0],  qp bit 1 always 0*
    3-4 data VLs: [qp7, qp6, qp5, qp4, qp3, qp2, qp1] ^
                  [  0,   0,   0,   0,   0, sc1, sc0], qp bits [21] always 0
    5-8 data VLs: [qp7, qp6, qp5, qp4, qp3, qp2, qp1] ^
                  [  0,   0,   0,   0, sc2, sc1, sc0] qp bits [321] always 0
    
    Fix by qualifying the warning for qos_shift > 1 and producing the correct
    mask to insure the above bits are zero without generating a superfluous
    warning.

    apparmor: enforce nullbyte at end of tag string
    
    commit 8404d7a674c49278607d19726e0acc0cae299357 upstream.
    
    A packed AppArmor policy contains null-terminated tag strings that are read
    by unpack_nameX(). However, unpack_nameX() uses string functions on them
    without ensuring that they are actually null-terminated, potentially
    leading to out-of-bounds accesses.
    
    Make sure that the tag string is null-terminated before passing it to
    strcmp().

    usb: chipidea: udc: workaround for endpoint conflict issue
    
    commit c19dffc0a9511a7d7493ec21019aefd97e9a111b upstream.
    
    An endpoint conflict occurs when the USB is working in device mode
    during an isochronous communication. When the endpointA IN direction
    is an isochronous IN endpoint, and the host sends an IN token to
    endpointA on another device, then the OUT transaction may be missed
    regardless the OUT endpoint number. Generally, this occurs when the
    device is connected to the host through a hub and other devices are
    connected to the same hub.
    
    The affected OUT endpoint can be either control, bulk, isochronous, or
    an interrupt endpoint. After the OUT endpoint is primed, if an IN token
    to the same endpoint number on another device is received, then the OUT
    endpoint may be unprimed (cannot be detected by software), which causes
    this endpoint to no longer respond to the host OUT token, and thus, no
    corresponding interrupt occurs.
    
    There is no good workaround for this issue, the only thing the software
    could do is numbering isochronous IN from the highest endpoint since we
    have observed most of device number endpoint from the lowest.

    scsi: ufs: Avoid runtime suspend possibly being blocked forever
    
    commit 24e2e7a19f7e4b83d0d5189040d997bce3596473 upstream.
    
    UFS runtime suspend can be triggered after pm_runtime_enable() is invoked
    in ufshcd_pltfrm_init(). However if the first runtime suspend is triggered
    before binding ufs_hba structure to ufs device structure via
    platform_set_drvdata(), then UFS runtime suspend will be no longer
    triggered in the future because its dev->power.runtime_error was set in the
    first triggering and does not have any chance to be cleared.
    
    To be more clear, dev->power.runtime_error is set if hba is NULL in
    ufshcd_runtime_suspend() which returns -EINVAL to rpm_callback() where
    dev->power.runtime_error is set as -EINVAL. In this case, any future
    rpm_suspend() for UFS device fails because rpm_check_suspend_allowed()
    fails due to non-zero
    dev->power.runtime_error.
    
    To resolve this issue, make sure the first UFS runtime suspend get valid
    "hba" in ufshcd_runtime_suspend(): Enable UFS runtime PM only after hba is
    successfully bound to UFS device structure.

    mmc: core: Prevent processing SDIO IRQs when the card is suspended
    
    commit 83293386bc95cf5e9f0c0175794455835bd1cb4a upstream.
    
    Processing of SDIO IRQs must obviously be prevented while the card is
    system suspended, otherwise we may end up trying to communicate with an
    uninitialized SDIO card.
    
    Reports throughout the years shows that this is not only a theoretical
    problem, but a real issue. So, let's finally fix this problem, by keeping
    track of the state for the card and bail out before processing the SDIO
    IRQ, in case the card is suspended.

    objtool: Support per-function rodata sections
    
    commit 4a60aa05a0634241ce17f957bf9fb5ac1eed6576 upstream.
    
    Add support for processing switch jump tables in objects with multiple
    .rodata sections, such as those created by '-ffunction-sections' and
    '-fdata-sections'.  Currently, objtool always looks in .rodata for jump
    table information, which results in many "sibling call from callable
    instruction with modified stack frame" warnings with objects compiled
    using those flags.
    
    The fix is comprised of three parts:
    
    1. Flagging all .rodata sections when importing ELF information for
       easier checking later.
    
    2. Keeping a reference to the section each relocation is from in order
       to get the list_head for the other relocations in that section.
    
    3. Finding jump tables by following relocations to .rodata sections,
       rather than always referencing a single global .rodata section.
    
    The patch has been tested without data sections enabled and no
    differences in the resulting orc unwind information were seen.
    
    Note that as objtool adds terminators to end of each .text section the
    unwind information generated between a function+data sections build and
    a normal build aren't directly comparable. Manual inspection suggests
    that objtool is now generating the correct information, or at least
    making more of an effort to do so than it did previously.

    tracing: Silence GCC 9 array bounds warning
    
    commit 0c97bf863efce63d6ab7971dad811601e6171d2f upstream.
    
    Starting with GCC 9, -Warray-bounds detects cases when memset is called
    starting on a member of a struct but the size to be cleared ends up
    writing over further members.
    
    Such a call happens in the trace code to clear, at once, all members
    after and including `seq` on struct trace_iterator:
    
        In function 'memset',
            inlined from 'ftrace_dump' at kernel/trace/trace.c:8914:3:
        ./include/linux/string.h:344:9: warning: '__builtin_memset' offset
        [8505, 8560] from the object at 'iter' is out of the bounds of
        referenced subobject 'seq' with type 'struct trace_seq' at offset
        4368 [-Warray-bounds]
          344 |  return __builtin_memset(p, c, size);
              |         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    In order to avoid GCC complaining about it, we compute the address
    ourselves by adding the offsetof distance instead of referring
    directly to the member.
    
    Since there are two places doing this clear (trace.c and trace_kdb.c),
    take the chance to move the workaround into a single place in
    the internal header.
