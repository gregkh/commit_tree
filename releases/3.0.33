    ARM: 7409/1: Do not call flush_cache_user_range with mmap_sem held
    
    commit 435a7ef52db7d86e67a009b36cac1457f8972391 upstream.
    
    We can't be holding the mmap_sem while calling flush_cache_user_range
    because the flush can fault. If we fault on a user address, the
    page fault handler will try to take mmap_sem again. Since both places
    acquire the read lock, most of the time it succeeds. However, if another
    thread tries to acquire the write lock on the mmap_sem (e.g. mmap) in
    between the call to flush_cache_user_range and the fault, the down_read
    in do_page_fault will deadlock.

    commit 4542b6a0fa6b48d9ae6b41c1efeb618b7a221b2a upstream.
    
    vma isn't used and flush_cache_user_range isn't a standard macro that

    OEM parameters [1] are parsed from the platform option-rom / efi
    driver.  By default the driver was validating the parameters for the
    dual-controller case, but in single-controller case only the first set
    of parameters may be valid.
    
    Limit the validation to the number of actual controllers detected
    otherwise the driver may fail to parse the valid parameters leading to
    driver-load or runtime failures.

    drm/i915: [GEN7] Use HW scheduler for fixed function shaders
    
    commit a1e969e0332de7a430e62822cee8f2ec8d83cd7c upstream.
    
    This originally started as a patch from Bernard as a way of simply
    setting the VS scheduler. After submitting the RFC patch, we decided to
    also modify the DS scheduler. To be most explicit, I've made the patch
    explicitly set all scheduler modes, and included the defines for other
    modes (in case someone feels frisky later).
    
    The rest of the story gets a bit weird. The first version of the patch
    showed an almost unbelievable performance improvement. Since rebasing my
    branch it appears the performance improvement has gone, unfortunately.
    But setting these bits seem to be the right thing to do given that the
    docs describe corruption that can occur with the default settings.
    
    In summary, I am seeing no more perf improvements (or regressions) in my
    limited testing, but we believe this should be set to prevent rendering
    corruption, therefore cc stable.
    
    v1: Clear bit 4 also (Ken + Eugeni)
    Do a full clear + set of the bits we want (Me).

    commit 9adab8b5a7fde248504f484e197589f3e3c922e2 upstream.
    
    Currently the code re-reads PCH_IIR during the hotplug interrupt
    processing. Not only is this a wasted read, but introduces a potential
    for handling a spurious interrupt as we then may not clear all the
    interrupts processed (since the re-read IIR may contains more interrupts
    asserted than we clear using the result of the original read).

    xhci: Add new short TX quirk for Fresco Logic host.
    
    commit 1530bbc6272d9da1e39ef8e06190d42c13a02733 upstream.
    
    Sergio reported that when he recorded audio from a USB headset mic
    plugged into the USB 3.0 port on his ASUS N53SV-DH72, the audio sounded
    "robotic".  When plugged into the USB 2.0 port under EHCI on the same
    laptop, the audio sounded fine.  The device is:
    
    Bus 002 Device 004: ID 046d:0a0c Logitech, Inc. Clear Chat Comfort USB Headset
    
    The problem was tracked down to the Fresco Logic xHCI host controller
    not correctly reporting short transfers on isochronous IN endpoints.
    The driver would submit a 96 byte transfer, the device would only send
    88 or 90 bytes, and the xHCI host would report the transfer had a
    "successful" completion code, with an untransferred buffer length of 8
    or 6 bytes.
    
    The successful completion code and non-zero untransferred length is a
    contradiction.  The xHCI host is supposed to only mark a transfer as
    successful if all the bytes are transferred.  Otherwise, the transfer
    should be marked with a short packet completion code.  Without the EHCI
    bus trace, we wouldn't know whether the xHCI driver should trust the
    completion code or the untransferred length.  With it, we know to trust
    the untransferred length.
    
    Add a new xHCI quirk for the Fresco Logic host controller.  If a
    transfer is reported as successful, but the untransferred length is
    non-zero, print a warning.  For the Fresco Logic host, change the
    completion code to COMP_SHORT_TX and process the transfer like a short
    transfer.
    
    This should be backported to stable kernels that contain the commit
    f5182b4155b9d686c5540a6822486400e34ddd98 "xhci: Disable MSI for some
    Fresco Logic hosts."  That commit was marked for stable kernels as old

    xhci: Reset reserved command ring TRBs on cleanup.
    
    commit 33b2831ac870d50cc8e01c317b07fb1e69c13fe1 upstream.
    
    When the xHCI driver needs to clean up memory (perhaps due to a failed
    register restore on resume from S3 or resume from S4), it needs to reset
    the number of reserved TRBs on the command ring to zero.  Otherwise,
    several resume cycles (about 30) with a UAS device attached will
    continually increment the number of reserved TRBs, until all command
    submissions fail because there isn't enough room on the command ring.

    usb-xhci: Handle COMP_TX_ERR for isoc tds
    
    commit 9c745995ae5c4ff787f34a359de908facc11ee00 upstream.
    
    While testing unplugging an UVC HD webcam with usb-redirection (so through
    usbdevfs), my userspace usb-redir code was getting a value of -1 in
    iso_frame_desc[n].status, which according to Documentation/usb/error-codes.txt
    is not a valid value.
    
    The source of this -1 is the default case in xhci-ring.c:process_isoc_td()
    adding a kprintf there showed the value of trb_comp_code to be COMP_TX_ERR
    in this case, so this patch adds handling for that completion code to
    process_isoc_td().
    
    This was observed and tested with the following xhci controller:
    1033:0194 NEC Corporation uPD720200 USB 3.0 Host Controller (rev 04)
    
    Note: I also wonder if setting frame->status to -1 (-EPERM) is the best we can
    do, but since I cannot come up with anything better I've left that as is.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.36, which contain the
    commit 04e51901dd44f40a5a385ced897f6bca87d5f40a "USB: xHCI: Isochronous

    The upcoming Intel Lynx Point chipset includes an xHCI host controller
    that can have ports switched from the EHCI host controller, just like
    the Intel Panther Point xHCI host.  This time, ports from both EHCI
    hosts can be switched to the xHCI host controller.  The PCI config
    registers to do the port switching are in the exact same place in the
    xHCI PCI configuration registers, with the same semantics.

    dTD's next dtd pointer need to be updated once CPU writes it, or this
    request may not be handled by controller, then host will get NAK from
    device forever.
    
    This problem occurs when there is a request is handling, we need to add
    a new request to dTD list, if this new request is added before the current
    one is finished, the new request is intended to added as next dtd pointer
    at current dTD, but without wmb(), the dTD's next dtd pointer may not be
    updated when the controller reads it. In that case, the controller will
    still get Terminate Bit is 1 at dTD's next dtd pointer, that means there is
    no next request, then this new request is missed by controller.

    SCSI: hpsa: Fix problem with MSA2xxx devices
    
    commit 9bc3711cbb67ac620bf09b4a147cbab45b2c36c0 upstream.
    
    Upgraded firmware on Smart Array P7xx (and some others) made them show up as
    SCSI revision 5 devices and this caused the driver to fail to map MSA2xxx
    logical drives to the correct bus/target/lun.  A symptom of this would be that
    the target ID of the logical drives as presented by the external storage array
    is ignored, and all such logical drives are assigned to target zero,
    differentiated only by LUN.  Some multipath software reportedly does not deal
    well with this behavior, failing to recognize different paths to the same
    device as such.

    The out functions should only handle actual available data instead of the complete buffer.

    A flush request is usually issued in transaction commit code path, so
    using GFP_KERNEL to allocate memory for flush request bio falls into
    the classic deadlock issue.
    
    This is suitable for any -stable kernel to which it applies as it

    This implied a reference counting bug and the problem happened during
    mbind().
    
    mbind() applies a new memory policy to a range and uses mbind_range() to
    merge existing VMAs or split them as necessary.  In the event of splits,
    mpol_dup() will allocate a new struct mempolicy and maintain existing
    reference counts whose rules are documented in
    Documentation/vm/numa_memory_policy.txt .
    
    The problem occurs with shared memory policies.  The vm_op->set_policy
    increments the reference count if necessary and split_vma() and
    vma_merge() have already handled the existing reference counts.
    However, policy_vma() screws it up by replacing an existing
    vma->vm_policy with one that potentially has the wrong reference count
    leading to a premature free.  This patch removes the damage caused by
    policy_vma().
    
    With this patch applied Dave's trinity tool runs an mbind test for 5
    minutes without error.  /proc/slabinfo reported that there are no
    numa_policy or shared_policy_node objects allocated after the test
    completed and the shared memory region was deleted.

    workqueue: skip nr_running sanity check in worker_enter_idle() if trustee is active
    
    commit 544ecf310f0e7f51fa057ac2a295fc1b3b35a9d3 upstream.
    
    worker_enter_idle() has WARN_ON_ONCE() which triggers if nr_running
    isn't zero when every worker is idle.  This can trigger spuriously
    while a cpu is going down due to the way trustee sets %WORKER_ROGUE
    and zaps nr_running.
    
    It first sets %WORKER_ROGUE on all workers without updating
    nr_running, releases gcwq->lock, schedules, regrabs gcwq->lock and
    then zaps nr_running.  If the last running worker enters idle
    inbetween, it would see stale nr_running which hasn't been zapped yet
    and trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE().
    
    Fix it by performing the sanity check iff the trustee is idle.

    commit f15b9000eb1d09bbaa4b0a6b2089d7e1f64e84b3 upstream.
    
    UML uses the _PAGE_NEWPAGE flag to mark pages which are not jet
    installed on the host side using mmap().
    pte_same() has to ignore this flag, otherwise unuse_pte_range()
    is unable to unuse the page because two identical
    page tables entries with different _PAGE_NEWPAGE flags would not
    match and swapoff() would never return.

    aux_free is freed on all other exits from the function.  By removing the
    return, we can benefit from the vfree already at the end of the function.

    We reset the bool names and values array to NULL, but do not reset the
    number of entries in these arrays to 0.  If we error out and then get back
    into this function we will walk these NULL pointers based on the belief
    that they are non-zero length.

    KEYS: Use the compat keyctl() syscall wrapper on Sparc64 for Sparc32 compat
    
    commit 45de6767dc51358a188f75dc4ad9dfddb7fb9480 upstream.
    
    Use the 32-bit compat keyctl() syscall wrapper on Sparc64 for Sparc32 binary
    compatibility.
    
    Without this, keyctl(KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE_IOV) is liable to malfunction as it
    uses an iovec array read from userspace - though the kernel should survive this
    as it checks pointers and sizes anyway.
    
    I think all the other keyctl() function should just work, provided (a) the top
    32-bits of each 64-bit argument register are cleared prior to invoking the
    syscall routine, and the 32-bit address space is right at the 0-end of the
    64-bit address space.  Most of the arguments are 32-bit anyway, and so for
    those clearing is not required.

    SCSI: mpt2sas: Fix for panic happening because of improper memory allocation
    
    commit e42fafc25fa86c61824e8d4c5e7582316415d24f upstream.
    
    The ioc->pfacts member in the IOC structure is getting set to zero
    following a call to _base_get_ioc_facts due to the memset in that routine.
    So if the ioc->pfacts was read after a host reset, there would be a NULL
    pointer dereference. The routine _base_get_ioc_facts is called from context
    of host reset.  The problem in _base_get_ioc_facts  is the size of
    Mpi2IOCFactsReply is 64, whereas the sizeof "struct mpt2sas_facts" is 60,
    so there is a four byte overflow resulting from the memset.
    
    Also, there is memset in _base_get_port_facts using the incorrect structure,
    it should be "struct mpt2sas_port_facts" instead of Mpi2PortFactsReply.

    s390/pfault: fix task state race
    
    commit d5e50a51ccbda36b379aba9d1131a852eb908dda upstream.
    
    When setting the current task state to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE this can
    race with a different cpu. The other cpu could set the task state after
    it inspected it (while it was still TASK_RUNNING) to TASK_RUNNING which
    would change the state from TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE to TASK_RUNNING again.
    
    This race was always present in the pfault interrupt code but didn't
    cause anything harmful before commit f2db2e6c "[S390] pfault: cpu hotplug
    vs missing completion interrupts" which relied on the fact that after
    setting the task state to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE the task would really
    sleep.
    Since this is not necessarily the case the result may be a list corruption
    of the pfault_list or, as observed, a use-after-free bug while trying to
    access the task_struct of a task which terminated itself already.
    
    To fix this, we need to get a reference of the affected task when receiving
    the initial pfault interrupt and add special handling if we receive yet
    another initial pfault interrupt when the task is already enqueued in the
    pfault list.

    Fix blocking allocations called very early during bootup
    
    commit 31a67102f4762df5544bc2dfb34a931233d2a5b2 upstream.
    
    During early boot, when the scheduler hasn't really been fully set up,
    we really can't do blocking allocations because with certain (dubious)
    configurations the "might_resched()" calls can actually result in
    scheduling events.
    
    We could just make such users always use GFP_ATOMIC, but quite often the
    code that does the allocation isn't really aware of the fact that the
    scheduler isn't up yet, and forcing that kind of random knowledge on the
    initialization code is just annoying and not good for anybody.
    
    And we actually have a the 'gfp_allowed_mask' exactly for this reason:
    it's just that the kernel init sequence happens to set it to allow
    blocking allocations much too early.
    
    So move the 'gfp_allowed_mask' initialization from 'start_kernel()'
    (which is some of the earliest init code, and runs with preemption
    disabled for good reasons) into 'kernel_init()'.  kernel_init() is run
    in the newly created thread that will become the 'init' process, as
    opposed to the early startup code that runs within the context of what
    will be the first idle thread.
    
    So by the time we reach 'kernel_init()', we know that the scheduler must
    be at least limping along, because we've already scheduled from the idle
    thread into the init thread.

    cfg80211: warn if db.txt is empty with CONFIG_CFG80211_INTERNAL_REGDB
    
    commit 80007efeff0568375b08faf93c7aad65602cb97e upstream.
    
    It has happened twice now where elaborate troubleshooting has
    undergone on systems where CONFIG_CFG80211_INTERNAL_REGDB [0]
    has been set but yet net/wireless/db.txt was not updated.
    
    Despite the documentation on this it seems system integrators could
    use some more help with this, so throw out a kernel warning at boot time
    when their database is empty.
    
    This does mean that the error-prone system integrator won't likely
    realize the issue until they boot the machine but -- it does not seem
    to make sense to enable a build bug breaking random build testing.

    vfs: make AIO use the proper rw_verify_area() area helpers
    
    commit a70b52ec1aaeaf60f4739edb1b422827cb6f3893 upstream.
    
    We had for some reason overlooked the AIO interface, and it didn't use
    the proper rw_verify_area() helper function that checks (for example)
    mandatory locking on the file, and that the size of the access doesn't
    cause us to overflow the provided offset limits etc.
    
    Instead, AIO did just the security_file_permission() thing (that
    rw_verify_area() also does) directly.
    
    This fixes it to do all the proper helper functions, which not only
    means that now mandatory file locking works with AIO too, we can
    actually remove lines of code.

    Squashfs manages to read in the end block(s) of the disk during the
    mount operation.  Then, when dd reads the block device, it leads to
    block_read_full_page being called with buffers that are beyond end of
    disk, but are marked as mapped.  Thus, it would end up submitting read
    I/O against them, resulting in the errors mentioned above.  I fixed the
    problem by modifying init_page_buffers to only set the buffer mapped if
    it fell inside of i_size.
    
    Cheers,
    Jeff

    block: fix buffer overflow when printing partition UUIDs

    leading to the following panic with stackprotector enabled.

    Increase the buffer size, remove the dangerous part_unpack_uuid() and

    tilegx: enable SYSCALL_WRAPPERS support
    
    commit e6d9668e119af44ae5bcd5f1197174531458afe3 upstream.
    
    Some discussion with the glibc mailing lists revealed that this was
    necessary for 64-bit platforms with MIPS-like sign-extension rules
    for 32-bit values.  The original symptom was that passing (uid_t)-1 to
    setreuid() was failing in programs linked -pthread because of the "setxid"
    mechanism for passing setxid-type function arguments to the syscall code.
    SYSCALL_WRAPPERS handles ensuring that all syscall arguments end up with
    proper sign-extension and is thus the appropriate fix for this problem.
    
    On other platforms (s390, powerpc, sparc64, and mips) this was fixed
    in 2.6.28.6.  The general issue is tracked as CVE-2009-0029.
