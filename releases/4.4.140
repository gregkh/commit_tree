    netfilter: nf_log: don't hold nf_log_mutex during user access
    
    commit ce00bf07cc95a57cd20b208e02b3c2604e532ae8 upstream.
    
    The old code would indefinitely block other users of nf_log_mutex if
    a userspace access in proc_dostring() blocked e.g. due to a userfaultfd
    region. Fix it by moving proc_dostring() out of the locked region.
    
    This is a followup to commit 266d07cb1c9a ("netfilter: nf_log: fix
    sleeping function called from invalid context"), which changed this code
    from using rcu_read_lock() to taking nf_log_mutex.

    But the chip ready is not enough to check the operation status.
    So change this to check the chip good instead of this.

    commit 45f75b8a919a4255f52df454f1ffdee0e42443b2 upstream.
    
    For the word write functions it is retried for error.
    But it is not implemented to retry for the erase functions.
    To make sure for the erase functions change to retry as same.
    
    This is needed to prevent the flash erase error caused only once.
    It was caused by the error case of chip_good() in the do_erase_oneblock().
    Also it was confirmed on the MACRONIX flash device MX29GL512FHT2I-11G.
    But the error issue behavior is not able to reproduce at this moment.
    The flash controller is parallel Flash interface integrated on BCM53003.

    mtd: rawnand: mxc: set spare area size register explicitly
    
    commit 3f77f244d8ec28e3a0a81240ffac7d626390060c upstream.
    
    The v21 version of the NAND flash controller contains a Spare Area Size
    Register (SPAS) at offset 0x10. Its setting defaults to the maximum
    spare area size of 218 bytes. The size that is set in this register is
    used by the controller when it calculates the ECC bytes internally in
    hardware.
    
    Usually, this register is updated from settings in the IIM fuses when
    the system is booting from NAND flash. For other boot media, however,
    the SPAS register remains at the default setting, which may not work for
    the particular flash chip on the board. The same goes for flash chips
    whose configuration cannot be set in the IIM fuses (e.g. chips with 2k
    sector size and 128 bytes spare area size can't be configured in the IIM
    fuses on imx25 systems).
    
    Set the SPAS register explicitly during the preset operation. Derive the
    register value from mtd->oobsize that was detected during probe by
    decoding the flash chip's ID bytes.
    
    While at it, rename the define for the spare area register's offset to
    NFC_V21_RSLTSPARE_AREA. The register at offset 0x10 on v1 controllers is
    different from the register on v21 controllers.

    dm bufio: avoid sleeping while holding the dm_bufio lock
    
    commit 9ea61cac0b1ad0c09022f39fd97e9b99a2cfc2dc upstream.
    
    We've seen in-field reports showing _lots_ (18 in one case, 41 in
    another) of tasks all sitting there blocked on:
    
      mutex_lock+0x4c/0x68

      shrink_slab.part.54.constprop.65+0x100/0x464
      shrink_zone+0xa8/0x198
    
    In the two cases analyzed, we see one task that looks like this:
    
      Workqueue: kverityd verity_prefetch_io
    
      __switch_to+0x9c/0xa8
      __schedule+0x440/0x6d8
      schedule+0x94/0xb4

      worker_thread+0x2fc/0x424
      kthread+0x10c/0x114
    
    ...and that looks to be the one holding the mutex.
    
    The problem has been reproduced on fairly easily:
    0. Be running Chrome OS w/ verity enabled on the root filesystem
    1. Pick test patch: http://crosreview.com/412360
    2. Install launchBalloons.sh and balloon.arm from
         http://crbug.com/468342
       ...that's just a memory stress test app.
    3. On a 4GB rk3399 machine, run
         nice ./launchBalloons.sh 4 900 100000
       ...that tries to eat 4 * 900 MB of memory and keep accessing.
    4. Login to the Chrome web browser and restore many tabs
    
    With that, I've seen printouts like:
      DOUG: long bufio 90758 ms
    ...and stack trace always show's we're in dm_bufio_prefetch().
    
    The problem is that we try to allocate memory with GFP_NOIO while
    we're holding the dm_bufio lock.  Instead we should be using
    GFP_NOWAIT.  Using GFP_NOIO can cause us to sleep while holding the
    lock and that causes the above problems.
    
    The current behavior explained by David Rientjes:
    
      It will still try reclaim initially because __GFP_WAIT (or
      __GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM) is set by GFP_NOIO.  This is the cause of
      contention on dm_bufio_lock() that the thread holds.  You want to
      pass GFP_NOWAIT instead of GFP_NOIO to alloc_buffer() when holding a
      mutex that can be contended by a concurrent slab shrinker (if
      count_objects didn't use a trylock, this pattern would trivially
      deadlock).
    
    This change significantly increases responsiveness of the system while
    in this state.  It makes a real difference because it unblocks kswapd.
    In the bug report analyzed, kswapd was hung:
    
       kswapd0         D ffffffc000204fd8     0    72      2 0x00000000

    mm, page_alloc: do not break __GFP_THISNODE by zonelist reset
    
    commit 7810e6781e0fcbca78b91cf65053f895bf59e85f upstream.
    
    In __alloc_pages_slowpath() we reset zonelist and preferred_zoneref for
    allocations that can ignore memory policies.  The zonelist is obtained
    from current CPU's node.  This is a problem for __GFP_THISNODE
    allocations that want to allocate on a different node, e.g.  because the
    allocating thread has been migrated to a different CPU.
    
    This has been observed to break SLAB in our 4.4-based kernel, because
    there it relies on __GFP_THISNODE working as intended.  If a slab page
    is put on wrong node's list, then further list manipulations may corrupt
    the list because page_to_nid() is used to determine which node's
    list_lock should be locked and thus we may take a wrong lock and race.
    
    Current SLAB implementation seems to be immune by luck thanks to commit
    511e3a058812 ("mm/slab: make cache_grow() handle the page allocated on
    arbitrary node") but there may be others assuming that __GFP_THISNODE
    works as promised.
    
    We can fix it by simply removing the zonelist reset completely.  There
    is actually no reason to reset it, because memory policies and cpusets
    don't affect the zonelist choice in the first place.  This was different
    when commit 183f6371aac2 ("mm: ignore mempolicies when using
    ALLOC_NO_WATERMARK") introduced the code, as mempolicies provided their
    own restricted zonelists.
    
    We might consider this for 4.17 although I don't know if there's
    anything currently broken.
    
    SLAB is currently not affected, but in kernels older than 4.7 that don't
    yet have 511e3a058812 ("mm/slab: make cache_grow() handle the page
    allocated on arbitrary node") it is.  That's at least 4.4 LTS.  Older
    ones I'll have to check.
    
    So stable backports should be more important, but will have to be
    reviewed carefully, as the code went through many changes.  BTW I think
    that also the ac->preferred_zoneref reset is currently useless if we
    don't also reset ac->nodemask from a mempolicy to NULL first (which we
    probably should for the OOM victims etc?), but I would leave that for a
    separate patch.

    commit 3ee9bc12342cf546313d300808ff47d7dbb8e7db upstream.
    
    The cx25840 driver currently configures 885, 887, and 888 using
    default divisors for each chip. This check to see if the cx23885
    driver has passed the cx25840 a non-default clock rate for a
    specific chip. If a cx23885 board has left clk_freq at 0, the
    clock default values will be used to configure the PLLs.
    
    This patch only has effect on 888 boards who set clk_freq to 25M.

    x86/mce: Fix incorrect "Machine check from unknown source" message
    
    commit 40c36e2741d7fe1e66d6ec55477ba5fd19c9c5d2 upstream.
    
    Some injection testing resulted in the following console log:
    
      mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 22: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 1: bd80000000100134
      mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP 10:<ffffffffc05292dd> {pmem_do_bvec+0x11d/0x330 [nd_pmem]}

      mce: [Hardware Error]: Run the above through 'mcelog --ascii'
      Kernel panic - not syncing: Machine check from unknown source
    
    This confused everybody because the first line quite clearly shows
    that we found a logged error in "Bank 1", while the last line says
    "unknown source".
    
    The problem is that the Linux code doesn't do the right thing
    for a local machine check that results in a fatal error.
    
    It turns out that we know very early in the handler whether the
    machine check is fatal. The call to mce_no_way_out() has checked
    all the banks for the CPU that took the local machine check. If
    it says we must crash, we can do so right away with the right
    messages.
    
    We do scan all the banks again. This means that we might initially
    not see a problem, but during the second scan find something fatal.
    If this happens we print a slightly different message (so I can
    see if it actually every happens).

    HID: hiddev: fix potential Spectre v1
    
    commit 4f65245f2d178b9cba48350620d76faa4a098841 upstream.
    
    uref->field_index, uref->usage_index, finfo.field_index and cinfo.index can be
    indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading to a potential exploitation
    of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.
    
    This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:
    
    drivers/hid/usbhid/hiddev.c:473 hiddev_ioctl_usage() warn: potential spectre issue 'report->field' (local cap)
    drivers/hid/usbhid/hiddev.c:477 hiddev_ioctl_usage() warn: potential spectre issue 'field->usage' (local cap)
    drivers/hid/usbhid/hiddev.c:757 hiddev_ioctl() warn: potential spectre issue 'report->field' (local cap)
    drivers/hid/usbhid/hiddev.c:801 hiddev_ioctl() warn: potential spectre issue 'hid->collection' (local cap)
    
    Fix this by sanitizing such structure fields before using them to index
    report->field, field->usage and hid->collection
    
    Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
    to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
    completed with a dependent load/store [1].

    ext4: check superblock mapped prior to committing
    
    commit a17712c8e4be4fa5404d20e9cd3b2b21eae7bc56 upstream.
    
    This patch attempts to close a hole leading to a BUG seen with hot
    removals during writes [1].
    
    A block device (NVME namespace in this test case) is formatted to EXT4
    without partitions. It's mounted and write I/O is run to a file, then
    the device is hot removed from the slot. The superblock attempts to be
    written to the drive which is no longer present.
    
    The typical chain of events leading to the BUG:
    ext4_commit_super()
      __sync_dirty_buffer()
        submit_bh()
          submit_bh_wbc()
            BUG_ON(!buffer_mapped(bh));
    
    This fix checks for the superblock's buffer head being mapped prior to
    syncing.

    ext4: add more mount time checks of the superblock
    
    commit bfe0a5f47ada40d7984de67e59a7d3390b9b9ecc upstream.
    
    The kernel's ext4 mount-time checks were more permissive than
    e2fsprogs's libext2fs checks when opening a file system.  The
    superblock is considered too insane for debugfs or e2fsck to operate
    on it, the kernel has no business trying to mount it.
    
    This will make file system fuzzing tools work harder, but the failure
    cases that they find will be more useful and be easier to evaluate.

    ext4: clear i_data in ext4_inode_info when removing inline data
    
    commit 6e8ab72a812396996035a37e5ca4b3b99b5d214b upstream.
    
    When converting from an inode from storing the data in-line to a data
    block, ext4_destroy_inline_data_nolock() was only clearing the on-disk
    copy of the i_blocks[] array.  It was not clearing copy of the
    i_blocks[] in ext4_inode_info, in i_data[], which is the copy actually
    used by ext4_map_blocks().
    
    This didn't matter much if we are using extents, since the extents
    header would be invalid and thus the extents could would re-initialize
    the extents tree.  But if we are using indirect blocks, the previous
    contents of the i_blocks array will be treated as block numbers, with
    potentially catastrophic results to the file system integrity and/or
    user data.
    
    This gets worse if the file system is using a 1k block size and
    s_first_data is zero, but even without this, the file system can get
    quite badly corrupted.
    
    This addresses CVE-2018-10881.

    uninit_bg or metadata_csum feature is enabled.  We were not
    consistently looking at this field; fix this.
    
    Also block group #0 must never have uninitialized allocation bitmaps,
    or need to be zeroed, since that's where the root inode, and other
    special inodes are set up.  Check for these conditions and mark the
    file system as corrupted if they are detected.

    cifs: Fix infinite loop when using hard mount option
    
    commit 7ffbe65578b44fafdef577a360eb0583929f7c6e upstream.
    
    For every request we send, whether it is SMB1 or SMB2+, we attempt to
    reconnect tcon (cifs_reconnect_tcon or smb2_reconnect) before carrying
    out the request.
    
    So, while server->tcpStatus != CifsNeedReconnect, we wait for the
    reconnection to succeed on wait_event_interruptible_timeout(). If it
    returns, that means that either the condition was evaluated to true, or
    timeout elapsed, or it was interrupted by a signal.
    
    Since we're not handling the case where the process woke up due to a
    received signal (-ERESTARTSYS), the next call to
    wait_event_interruptible_timeout() will _always_ fail and we end up
    looping forever inside either cifs_reconnect_tcon() or smb2_reconnect().
    
    Here's an example of how to trigger that:
    
    $ mount.cifs //foo/share /mnt/test -o
    username=foo,password=foo,vers=1.0,hard
    
    (break connection to server before executing bellow cmd)
    $ stat -f /mnt/test & sleep 140
    [1] 2511
    
    $ ps -aux -q 2511
    USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
    root      2511  0.0  0.0  12892  1008 pts/0    S    12:24   0:00 stat -f
    /mnt/test
    
    $ kill -9 2511
    
    (wait for a while; process is stuck in the kernel)
    $ ps -aux -q 2511
    USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
    root      2511 83.2  0.0  12892  1008 pts/0    R    12:24  30:01 stat -f
    /mnt/test
    
    By using 'hard' mount point means that cifs.ko will keep retrying
    indefinitely, however we must allow the process to be killed otherwise
    it would hang the system.

    drbd: fix access after free
    
    commit 64dafbc9530c10300acffc57fae3269d95fa8f93 upstream.
    
    We have
      struct drbd_requests { ... struct bio *private_bio;  ... }
    to hold a bio clone for local submission.
    
    On local IO completion, we put that bio, and in case we want to use the
    result later, we overload that member to hold the ERR_PTR() of the
    completion result,
    
    Which, before v4.3, used to be the passed in "int error",
    so we could first bio_put(), then assign.
    
    v4.3-rc1~100^2~21 4246a0b63bd8 block: add a bi_error field to struct bio
    changed that:
            bio_put(req->private_bio);
     -      req->private_bio = ERR_PTR(error);
     +      req->private_bio = ERR_PTR(bio->bi_error);
    
    Which introduces an access after free,
    because it was non obvious that req->private_bio == bio.
    
    Impact of that was mostly unnoticable, because we only use that value
    in a multiple-failure case, and even then map any "unexpected" error
    code to EIO, so worst case we could potentially mask a more specific
    error with EIO in a multiple failure case.
    
    Unless the pointed to memory region was unmapped, as is the case with
    CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, in which case this results in
    
      BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request
    
    v4.13-rc1~70^2~75 4e4cbee93d56 block: switch bios to blk_status_t
    changes it further to
            bio_put(req->private_bio);
            req->private_bio = ERR_PTR(blk_status_to_errno(bio->bi_status));
    
    And blk_status_to_errno() now contains a WARN_ON_ONCE() for unexpected
    values, which catches this "sometimes", if the memory has been reused
    quickly enough for other things.

    s390: Correct register corruption in critical section cleanup
    
    commit 891f6a726cacbb87e5b06076693ffab53bd378d7 upstream.
    
    In the critical section cleanup we must not mess with r1.  For march=z9
    or older, larl + ex (instead of exrl) are used with r1 as a temporary
    register. This can clobber r1 in several interrupt handlers. Fix this by
    using r11 as a temp register.  r11 is being saved by all callers of
    cleanup_critical.

    scsi: sg: mitigate read/write abuse
    
    commit 26b5b874aff5659a7e26e5b1997e3df2c41fa7fd upstream.
    
    As Al Viro noted in commit 128394eff343 ("sg_write()/bsg_write() is not fit
    to be called under KERNEL_DS"), sg improperly accesses userspace memory
    outside the provided buffer, permitting kernel memory corruption via
    splice().  But it doesn't just do it on ->write(), also on ->read().
    
    As a band-aid, make sure that the ->read() and ->write() handlers can not
    be called in weird contexts (kernel context or credentials different from
    file opener), like for ib_safe_file_access().
    
    If someone needs to use these interfaces from different security contexts,
    a new interface should be written that goes through the ->ioctl() handler.
    
    I've mostly copypasted ib_safe_file_access() over as sg_safe_file_access()
    because I couldn't find a good common header - please tell me if you know a
    better way.

    mm: hugetlb: yield when prepping struct pages
    
    commit 520495fe96d74e05db585fc748351e0504d8f40d upstream.
    
    When booting with very large numbers of gigantic (i.e.  1G) pages, the
    operations in the loop of gather_bootmem_prealloc, and specifically
    prep_compound_gigantic_page, takes a very long time, and can cause a
    softlockup if enough pages are requested at boot.
    
    For example booting with 3844 1G pages requires prepping
    (set_compound_head, init the count) over 1 billion 4K tail pages, which
    takes considerable time.
    
    Add a cond_resched() to the outer loop in gather_bootmem_prealloc() to
    prevent this lockup.
    
    Tested: Booted with softlockup_panic=1 hugepagesz=1G hugepages=3844 and
    no softlockup is reported, and the hugepages are reported as
    successfully setup.

    ubi: fastmap: Correctly handle interrupted erasures in EBA
    
    commit 781932375ffc6411713ee0926ccae8596ed0261c upstream.
    
    Fastmap cannot track the LEB unmap operation, therefore it can
    happen that after an interrupted erasure the mapping still looks
    good from Fastmap's point of view, while reading from the PEB will
    cause an ECC error and confuses the upper layer.
    
    Instead of teaching users of UBI how to deal with that, we read back
    the VID header and check for errors. If the PEB is empty or shows ECC
    errors we fixup the mapping and schedule the PEB for erasure.

    ARM: dts: imx6q: Use correct SDMA script for SPI5 core
    
    commit df07101e1c4a29e820df02f9989a066988b160e6 upstream.

    This fixes an issue we saw with DMA transfers.
    Sometimes the SPI controller RX FIFO was not empty after a DMA
    transfer and the driver got stuck in the next PIO transfer when
    it read one word more than expected.

    A spurious interrupt before the nvme driver has initialized the completion
    queue may inadvertently cause the driver to believe it has a completion
    to process. This may result in a NULL dereference since the nvmeq's tags
    are not set at this point.
    
    The patch initializes the host's CQ memory so that a spurious interrupt
    isn't mistaken for a real completion.

    x86/boot: Fix early command-line parsing when matching at end
    
    commit 02afeaae9843733a39cd9b11053748b2d1dc5ae7 upstream.
    
    The x86 early command line parsing in cmdline_find_option_bool() is
    buggy. If it matches a specified 'option' all the way to the end of the
    command-line, it will consider it a match.
    
    For instance,
    
      cmdline = "foo";
      cmdline_find_option_bool(cmdline, "fool");
    
    will return 1. This is particularly annoying since we have actual FPU
    options like "noxsave" and "noxsaves" So, command-line "foo bar noxsave"
    will match *BOTH* a "noxsave" and "noxsaves". (This turns out not to be
    an actual problem because "noxsave" implies "noxsaves", but it's still
    confusing.)
    
    To fix this, we simplify the code and stop tracking 'len'. 'len'
    was trying to indicate either the NULL terminator *OR* the end of a
    non-NULL-terminated command line at 'COMMAND_LINE_SIZE'. But, each of the
    three states is *already* checking 'cmdline' for a NULL terminator.
    
    We _only_ need to check if we have overrun 'COMMAND_LINE_SIZE', and that
    we can do without keeping 'len' around.
    
    Also add some commends to clarify what is going on.

    n_tty: Access echo_* variables carefully.
    
    commit ebec3f8f5271139df618ebdf8427e24ba102ba94 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting stalls at __process_echoes() [1]. This is because
    since ldata->echo_commit < ldata->echo_tail becomes true for some reason,
    the discard loop is serving as almost infinite loop. This patch tries to
    avoid falling into ldata->echo_commit < ldata->echo_tail situation by
    making access to echo_* variables more carefully.
    
    Since reset_buffer_flags() is called without output_lock held, it should
    not touch echo_* variables. And omit a call to reset_buffer_flags() from
    n_tty_open() by using vzalloc().
    
    Since add_echo_byte() is called without output_lock held, it needs memory
    barrier between storing into echo_buf[] and incrementing echo_head counter.
    echo_buf() needs corresponding memory barrier before reading echo_buf[].
    Lack of handling the possibility of not-yet-stored multi-byte operation
    might be the reason of falling into ldata->echo_commit < ldata->echo_tail
    situation, for if I do WARN_ON(ldata->echo_commit == tail + 1) prior to
    echo_buf(ldata, tail + 1), the WARN_ON() fires.
    
    Also, explicitly masking with buffer for the former "while" loop, and
    use ldata->echo_commit > tail for the latter "while" loop.

    staging: android: ion: Return an ERR_PTR in ion_map_kernel
    
    commit 0a2bc00341dcfcc793c0dbf4f8d43adf60458b05 upstream.
    
    The expected return value from ion_map_kernel is an ERR_PTR. The error
    path for a vmalloc failure currently just returns NULL, triggering
    a warning in ion_buffer_kmap_get. Encode the vmalloc failure as an ERR_PTR.

    n_tty: Fix stall at n_tty_receive_char_special().
    
    commit 3d63b7e4ae0dc5e02d28ddd2fa1f945defc68d81 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting stalls at n_tty_receive_char_special() [1]. This is
    because comparison is not working as expected since ldata->read_head can
    change at any moment. Mitigate this by explicitly masking with buffer size
    when checking condition for "while" loops.

    USB: serial: cp210x: add Silicon Labs IDs for Windows Update
    
    commit 2f839823382748664b643daa73f41ee0cc01ced6 upstream.
    
    Silicon Labs defines alternative VID/PID pairs for some chips that when
    used will automatically install drivers for Windows users without manual
    intervention. Unfortunately, these IDs are not recognized by the Linux
    module, so using these IDs improves user experience on one platform but
    degrades it on Linux. This patch addresses this problem.

    usb: cdc_acm: Add quirk for Uniden UBC125 scanner
    
    commit 4a762569a2722b8a48066c7bacf0e1dc67d17fa1 upstream.
    
    Uniden UBC125 radio scanner has USB interface which fails to work
    with cdc_acm driver:
      usb 1-1.5: new full-speed USB device number 4 using xhci_hcd
      cdc_acm 1-1.5:1.0: Zero length descriptor references
      cdc_acm: probe of 1-1.5:1.0 failed with error -22
    
    Adding the NO_UNION_NORMAL quirk for the device fixes the issue:
      usb 1-4: new full-speed USB device number 15 using xhci_hcd
      usb 1-4: New USB device found, idVendor=1965, idProduct=0018
      usb 1-4: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
