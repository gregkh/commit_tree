    media: uvcvideo: Fix uvc_alloc_entity() allocation alignment
    
    commit 89dd34caf73e28018c58cd193751e41b1f8bdc56 upstream.
    
    The use of ALIGN() in uvc_alloc_entity() is incorrect, since the size of
    (entity->pads) is not a power of two. As a stop-gap, until a better
    solution is adapted, use roundup() instead.
    
    Found by a static assertion. Compile-tested only.

    binder: fix race between munmap() and direct reclaim
    
    commit 5cec2d2e5839f9c0fec319c523a911e0a7fd299f upstream.
    
    An munmap() on a binder device causes binder_vma_close() to be called
    which clears the alloc->vma pointer.
    
    If direct reclaim causes binder_alloc_free_page() to be called, there
    is a race where alloc->vma is read into a local vma pointer and then
    used later after the mm->mmap_sem is acquired. This can result in
    calling zap_page_range() with an invalid vma which manifests as a
    use-after-free in zap_page_range().
    
    The fix is to check alloc->vma after acquiring the mmap_sem (which we
    were acquiring anyway) and skip zap_page_range() if it has changed
    to NULL.

    include/linux/module.h: copy __init/__exit attrs to init/cleanup_module
    
    commit a6e60d84989fa0e91db7f236eda40453b0e44afa upstream.
    
    The upcoming GCC 9 release extends the -Wmissing-attributes warnings
    (enabled by -Wall) to C and aliases: it warns when particular function
    attributes are missing in the aliases but not in their target.
    
    In particular, it triggers for all the init/cleanup_module
    aliases in the kernel (defined by the module_init/exit macros),
    ending up being very noisy.
    
    These aliases point to the __init/__exit functions of a module,
    which are defined as __cold (among other attributes). However,
    the aliases themselves do not have the __cold attribute.
    
    Since the compiler behaves differently when compiling a __cold
    function as well as when compiling paths leading to calls
    to __cold functions, the warning is trying to point out
    the possibly-forgotten attribute in the alias.
    
    In order to keep the warning enabled, we decided to silence
    this case. Ideally, we would mark the aliases directly
    as __init/__exit. However, there are currently around 132 modules
    in the kernel which are missing __init/__exit in their init/cleanup
    functions (either because they are missing, or for other reasons,
    e.g. the functions being called from somewhere else); and
    a section mismatch is a hard error.
    
    A conservative alternative was to mark the aliases as __cold only.
    However, since we would like to eventually enforce __init/__exit
    to be always marked,  we chose to use the new __copy function
    attribute (introduced by GCC 9 as well to deal with this).
    With it, we copy the attributes used by the target functions
    into the aliases. This way, functions that were not marked
    as __init/__exit won't have their aliases marked either,
    and therefore there won't be a section mismatch.
    
    Note that the warning would go away marking either the extern
    declaration, the definition, or both. However, we only mark
    the definition of the alias, since we do not want callers
    (which only see the declaration) to be compiled as if the function
    was __cold (and therefore the paths leading to those calls
    would be assumed to be unlikely).

    Compiler Attributes: add support for __copy (gcc >= 9)
    
    commit c0d9782f5b6d7157635ae2fd782a4b27d55a6013 upstream.
    
    From the GCC manual:
    
      copy
      copy(function)
    
        The copy attribute applies the set of attributes with which function
        has been declared to the declaration of the function to which
        the attribute is applied. The attribute is designed for libraries
        that define aliases or function resolvers that are expected
        to specify the same set of attributes as their targets. The copy
        attribute can be used with functions, variables, or types. However,
        the kind of symbol to which the attribute is applied (either
        function or variable) must match the kind of symbol to which
        the argument refers. The copy attribute copies only syntactic and
        semantic attributes but not attributes that affect a symbol’s
        linkage or visibility such as alias, visibility, or weak.
        The deprecated attribute is also not copied.
    
      https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Common-Function-Attributes.html
    
    The upcoming GCC 9 release extends the -Wmissing-attributes warnings
    (enabled by -Wall) to C and aliases: it warns when particular function
    attributes are missing in the aliases but not in their target, e.g.:
    
        void __cold f(void) {}
        void __alias("f") g(void);
    
    diagnoses:
    
        warning: 'g' specifies less restrictive attribute than
        its target 'f': 'cold' [-Wmissing-attributes]
    
    Using __copy(f) we can copy the __cold attribute from f to g:
    
        void __cold f(void) {}
        void __copy(f) __alias("f") g(void);
    
    This attribute is most useful to deal with situations where an alias
    is declared but we don't know the exact attributes the target has.
    
    For instance, in the kernel, the widely used module_init/exit macros
    define the init/cleanup_module aliases, but those cannot be marked
    always as __init/__exit since some modules do not have their
    functions marked as such.

    drm/rockchip: shutdown drm subsystem on shutdown
    
    commit b8f9d7f37b6af829c34c49d1a4f73ce6ed58e403 upstream.
    
    As explained by Robin Murphy:
    > the IOMMU shutdown disables paging, so if the VOP is still
    > scanning out then that will result in whatever IOVAs it was using now going
    > straight out onto the bus as physical addresses.
    
    We had a more radical approach before in commit
    7f3ef5dedb14 ("drm/rockchip: Allow driver to be shutdown on reboot/kexec")
    but that resulted in new warnings and oopses on shutdown on rk3399
    chromeos devices.
    
    So second try is resurrecting Vicentes shutdown change which should
    achieve the same result but in a less drastic way.

    staging: wlan-ng: fix adapter initialization failure
    
    commit a67fedd788182764dc8ed59037c604b7e60349f1 upstream.
    
    Commit e895f00a8496 ("Staging: wlan-ng: hfa384x_usb.c Fixed too long
    code line warnings.") moved the retrieval of the transfer buffer from
    the URB from the top of function hfa384x_usbin_callback to a point
    after reposting of the URB via a call to submit_rx_urb. The reposting
    of the URB allocates a new transfer buffer so the new buffer is
    retrieved instead of the buffer containing the response passed into
    the callback. This results in failure to initialize the adapter with
    an error reported in the system log (something like "CTLX[1] error:
    state(Request failed)").
    
    This change moves the retrieval to just before the point where the URB
    is reposted so that the correct transfer buffer is retrieved and
    initialization of the device succeeds.

    staging: vc04_services: prevent integer overflow in create_pagelist()
    
    commit ca641bae6da977d638458e78cd1487b6160a2718 upstream.
    
    The create_pagelist() "count" parameter comes from the user in
    vchiq_ioctl() and it could overflow.  If you look at how create_page()
    is called in vchiq_prepare_bulk_data(), then the "size" variable is an
    int so it doesn't make sense to allow negatives or larger than INT_MAX.
    
    I don't know this code terribly well, but I believe that typical values
    of "count" are typically quite low and I don't think this check will
    affect normal valid uses at all.
    
    The "pagelist_size" calculation can also overflow on 32 bit systems, but
    not on 64 bit systems.  I have added an integer overflow check for that
    as well.
    
    The Raspberry PI doesn't offer the same level of memory protection that
    x86 does so these sorts of bugs are probably not super critical to fix.

    As noted in commit 84b40e3b57ee ("serial: 8250: omap: Disable DMA for

    which will conflict with use of the line when DMA is enabled, e.g. when
    the console line is also used for systemd messages. So disable DMA
    support for UART console lines.

    doc: Cope with Sphinx logging deprecations
    
    commit 096ea522e84ea68f8e6c41e5e7294731a81e29bc upstream.
    
    Recent versions of sphinx will emit messages like:
    
      Documentation/sphinx/kerneldoc.py:103:
         RemovedInSphinx20Warning: app.warning() is now deprecated.
         Use sphinx.util.logging instead.
    
    Switch to sphinx.util.logging to make this unsightly message go away.
    Alas, that interface was only added in version 1.6, so we have to add a
    version check to keep things working with older sphinxes.

    kernel/signal.c: trace_signal_deliver when signal_group_exit
    
    commit 98af37d624ed8c83f1953b1b6b2f6866011fc064 upstream.
    
    In the fixes commit, removing SIGKILL from each thread signal mask and
    executing "goto fatal" directly will skip the call to
    "trace_signal_deliver".  At this point, the delivery tracking of the
    SIGKILL signal will be inaccurate.
    
    Therefore, we need to add trace_signal_deliver before "goto fatal" after
    executing sigdelset.
    
    Note: SEND_SIG_NOINFO matches the fact that SIGKILL doesn't have any info.

    memcg: make it work on sparse non-0-node systems
    
    commit 3e8589963773a5c23e2f1fe4bcad0e9a90b7f471 upstream.
    
    We have a single node system with node 0 disabled:
      Scanning NUMA topology in Northbridge 24
      Number of physical nodes 2
      Skipping disabled node 0
      Node 1 MemBase 0000000000000000 Limit 00000000fbff0000
      NODE_DATA(1) allocated [mem 0xfbfda000-0xfbfeffff]
    
    This causes crashes in memcg when system boots:
      BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000008
      #PF error: [normal kernel read fault]
    ...
      RIP: 0010:list_lru_add+0x94/0x170
    ...
      Call Trace:
       d_lru_add+0x44/0x50
       dput.part.34+0xfc/0x110
       __fput+0x108/0x230
       task_work_run+0x9f/0xc0
       exit_to_usermode_loop+0xf5/0x100
    
    It is reproducible as far as 4.12.  I did not try older kernels.  You have
    to have a new enough systemd, e.g.  241 (the reason is unknown -- was not
    investigated).  Cannot be reproduced with systemd 234.
    
    The system crashes because the size of lru array is never updated in
    memcg_update_all_list_lrus and the reads are past the zero-sized array,
    causing dereferences of random memory.
    
    The root cause are list_lru_memcg_aware checks in the list_lru code.  The
    test in list_lru_memcg_aware is broken: it assumes node 0 is always
    present, but it is not true on some systems as can be seen above.
    
    So fix this by avoiding checks on node 0.  Remember the memcg-awareness by
    a bool flag in struct list_lru.

    (crystal or clock generator at XIN). Set the ClockEn bit to 0 to disable
    clocking
      Bit 1: CrystalEnSet the CrystalEn bit high to enable the crystal
    oscillator. When using an external clock source at XIN, CrystalEn must
    be set low.
    
    The bit 4, MAX310X_CLKSRC_EXTCLK_BIT, should be set and was not.
    
    This was required to make the MAX3107 with an external crystal on our
    board able to send or receive data.

    drm/nouveau/i2c: Disable i2c bus access after ->fini()
    
    commit 342406e4fbba9a174125fbfe6aeac3d64ef90f76 upstream.
    
    For a while, we've had the problem of i2c bus access not grabbing
    a runtime PM ref when it's being used in userspace by i2c-dev, resulting
    in nouveau spamming the kernel log with errors if anything attempts to
    access the i2c bus while the GPU is in runtime suspend. An example:
    
    [  130.078386] nouveau 0000:01:00.0: i2c: aux 000d: begin idle timeout ffffffff
    
    Since the GPU is in runtime suspend, the MMIO region that the i2c bus is
    on isn't accessible. On x86, the standard behavior for accessing an
    unavailable MMIO region is to just return ~0.
    
    Except, that turned out to be a lie. While computers with a clean
    concious will return ~0 in this scenario, some machines will actually
    completely hang a CPU on certian bad MMIO accesses. This was witnessed
    with someone's Lenovo ThinkPad P50, where sensors-detect attempting to
    access the i2c bus while the GPU was suspended would result in a CPU
    hang:

      watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#5 stuck for 23s! [sensors-detect:12438]
    
    Yikes! While I wanted to try to make it so that accessing an i2c bus on
    nouveau would wake up the GPU as needed, airlied pointed out that pretty
    much any usecase for userspace accessing an i2c bus on a GPU (mainly for
    the DDC brightness control that some displays have) is going to only be
    useful while there's at least one display enabled on the GPU anyway, and
    the GPU never sleeps while there's displays running.
    
    Since teaching the i2c bus to wake up the GPU on userspace accesses is a
    good deal more difficult than it might seem, mostly due to the fact that
    we have to use the i2c bus during runtime resume of the GPU, we instead
    opt for the easiest solution: don't let userspace access i2c busses on
    the GPU at all while it's in runtime suspend.
    
    Changes since v1:
    * Also disable i2c busses that run over DP AUX

    KVM: s390: Do not report unusabled IDs via KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPU_ID
    
    commit a86cb413f4bf273a9d341a3ab2c2ca44e12eb317 upstream.
    
    KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPU_ID is currently always reporting KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID on all
    architectures. However, on s390x, the amount of usable CPUs is determined
    during runtime - it is depending on the features of the machine the code
    is running on. Since we are using the vcpu_id as an index into the SCA
    structures that are defined by the hardware (see e.g. the sca_add_vcpu()
    function), it is not only the amount of CPUs that is limited by the hard-
    ware, but also the range of IDs that we can use.
    Thus KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPU_ID must be determined during runtime on s390x, too.
    So the handling of KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPU_ID has to be moved from the common
    code into the architecture specific code, and on s390x we have to return
    the same value here as for KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPUS.
    This problem has been discovered with the kvm_create_max_vcpus selftest.
    With this change applied, the selftest now passes on s390x, too.

    commit 317d9313925cd8388304286c0d3c8dda7f060a2d upstream.
    
    I measured power consumption between power_save_node=1 and power_save_node=0.
    It's almost the same.
    Codec will enter to runtime suspend and suspend.
    That pin also will enter to D3. Don't need to enter to D3 by single pin.
    So, Disable power_save_node as default. It will avoid more issues.
    Windows Driver also has not this option at runtime PM.

        fd = perf_event_open(attr, 0, 1, -1, 0);
    
      This sets cpuhw->bhrb_filter to 0 and returns valid fd.
    
      2nd event:
        attr.sample_type |= PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK;
        attr.branch_sample_type = PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_CALL;
        fd = perf_event_open(attr, 0, 1, -1, 0);
    
      It overrides cpuhw->bhrb_filter to -1 and returns with error.
    
    Now if power_pmu_enable() gets called by any path other than
    power_pmu_add(), ppmu->config_bhrb(-1) will set MMCRA to -1.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Do not clear IRQ data of passthrough interrupts
    
    commit ef9740204051d0e00f5402fe96cf3a43ddd2bbbf upstream.
    
    The passthrough interrupts are defined at the host level and their IRQ
    data should not be cleared unless specifically deconfigured (shutdown)
    by the host. They differ from the IPI interrupts which are allocated
    by the XIVE KVM device and reserved to the guest usage only.
    
    This fixes a host crash when destroying a VM in which a PCI adapter
    was passed-through. In this case, the interrupt is cleared and freed
    by the KVM device and then shutdown by vfio at the host level.

    Btrfs: incremental send, fix file corruption when no-holes feature is enabled
    
    commit 6b1f72e5b82a5c2a4da4d1ebb8cc01913ddbea21 upstream.
    
    When using the no-holes feature, if we have a file with prealloc extents
    with a start offset beyond the file's eof, doing an incremental send can
    cause corruption of the file due to incorrect hole detection. Such case
    requires that the prealloc extent(s) exist in both the parent and send
    snapshots, and that a hole is punched into the file that covers all its
    extents that do not cross the eof boundary.
    
    Example reproducer:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -f -O no-holes /dev/sdb
      $ mount /dev/sdb /mnt/sdb
    
      $ xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xab 0 500K" /mnt/sdb/foobar
      $ xfs_io -c "falloc -k 1200K 800K" /mnt/sdb/foobar
    
      $ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt/sdb /mnt/sdb/base
    
      $ btrfs send -f /tmp/base.snap /mnt/sdb/base
    
      $ xfs_io -c "fpunch 0 500K" /mnt/sdb/foobar
    
      $ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt/sdb /mnt/sdb/incr
    
      $ btrfs send -p /mnt/sdb/base -f /tmp/incr.snap /mnt/sdb/incr
    
      $ md5sum /mnt/sdb/incr/foobar
      816df6f64deba63b029ca19d880ee10a   /mnt/sdb/incr/foobar
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc
      $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt/sdc
    
      $ btrfs receive -f /tmp/base.snap /mnt/sdc
      $ btrfs receive -f /tmp/incr.snap /mnt/sdc
    
      $ md5sum /mnt/sdc/incr/foobar
      cf2ef71f4a9e90c2f6013ba3b2257ed2   /mnt/sdc/incr/foobar
    
        --> Different checksum, because the prealloc extent beyond the
            file's eof confused the hole detection code and it assumed
            a hole starting at offset 0 and ending at the offset of the
            prealloc extent (1200Kb) instead of ending at the offset
            500Kb (the file's size).
    
    Fix this by ensuring we never cross the file's size when issuing the
    write operations for a hole.

    Btrfs: fix fsync not persisting changed attributes of a directory
    
    commit 60d9f50308e5df19bc18c2fefab0eba4a843900a upstream.
    
    While logging an inode we follow its ancestors and for each one we mark
    it as logged in the current transaction, even if we have not logged it.
    As a consequence if we change an attribute of an ancestor, such as the
    UID or GID for example, and then explicitly fsync it, we end up not
    logging the inode at all despite returning success to user space, which
    results in the attribute being lost if a power failure happens after
    the fsync.
    
    Sample reproducer:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
      $ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
    
      $ mkdir /mnt/dir
      $ chown 6007:6007 /mnt/dir
    
      $ sync
    
      $ chown 9003:9003 /mnt/dir
      $ touch /mnt/dir/file
      $ xfs_io -c fsync /mnt/dir/file
    
      # fsync our directory after fsync'ing the new file, should persist the
      # new values for the uid and gid.
      $ xfs_io -c fsync /mnt/dir
    
      <power failure>
    
      $ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
      $ stat -c %u:%g /mnt/dir
      6007:6007
    
        --> should be 9003:9003, the uid and gid were not persisted, despite
            the explicit fsync on the directory prior to the power failure
    
    Fix this by not updating the logged_trans field of ancestor inodes when
    logging an inode, since we have not logged them. Let only future calls to
    btrfs_log_inode() to mark inodes as logged.
    
    This could be triggered by my recent fsync fuzz tester for fstests, for
    which an fstests patch exists titled "fstests: generic, fsync fuzz tester
    with fsstress".

    Btrfs: fix race updating log root item during fsync
    
    commit 06989c799f04810f6876900d4760c0edda369cf7 upstream.
    
    When syncing the log, the final phase of a fsync operation, we need to
    either create a log root's item or update the existing item in the log
    tree of log roots, and that depends on the current value of the log
    root's log_transid - if it's 1 we need to create the log root item,
    otherwise it must exist already and we update it. Since there is no
    synchronization between updating the log_transid and checking it for
    deciding whether the log root's item needs to be created or updated, we
    end up with a tiny race window that results in attempts to update the
    item to fail because the item was not yet created:
    
                  CPU 1                                    CPU 2
    
      btrfs_sync_log()
    
        lock root->log_mutex
    
        set log root's log_transid to 1
    
        unlock root->log_mutex
    
                                                   btrfs_sync_log()
    
                                                     lock root->log_mutex
    
                                                     sets log root's
                                                     log_transid to 2
    
                                                     unlock root->log_mutex
    
        update_log_root()
    
          sees log root's log_transid
          with a value of 2
    
            calls btrfs_update_root(),
            which fails with -EUCLEAN
            and causes transaction abort
    
    Until recently the race lead to a BUG_ON at btrfs_update_root(), but after
    the recent commit 7ac1e464c4d47 ("btrfs: Don't panic when we can't find a
    root key") we just abort the current transaction.

    Btrfs: fix wrong ctime and mtime of a directory after log replay
    
    commit 5338e43abbab13791144d37fd8846847062351c6 upstream.
    
    When replaying a log that contains a new file or directory name that needs
    to be added to its parent directory, we end up updating the mtime and the
    ctime of the parent directory to the current time after we have set their
    values to the correct ones (set at fsync time), efectivelly losing them.
    
    Sample reproducer:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
      $ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
    
      $ mkdir /mnt/dir
      $ touch /mnt/dir/file
    
      # fsync of the directory is optional, not needed
      $ xfs_io -c fsync /mnt/dir
      $ xfs_io -c fsync /mnt/dir/file
    
      $ stat -c %Y /mnt/dir
      1557856079
    
      <power failure>
    
      $ sleep 3
      $ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
      $ stat -c %Y /mnt/dir
      1557856082
    
        --> should have been 1557856079, the mtime is updated to the current
            time when replaying the log
    
    Fix this by not updating the mtime and ctime to the current time at
    btrfs_add_link() when we are replaying a log tree.
    
    This could be triggered by my recent fsync fuzz tester for fstests, for
    which an fstests patch exists titled "fstests: generic, fsync fuzz tester
    with fsstress".

    scsi: zfcp: fix to prevent port_remove with pure auto scan LUNs (only sdevs)
    
    commit ef4021fe5fd77ced0323cede27979d80a56211ca upstream.
    
    When the user tries to remove a zfcp port via sysfs, we only rejected it if
    there are zfcp unit children under the port. With purely automatically
    scanned LUNs there are no zfcp units but only SCSI devices. In such cases,
    the port_remove erroneously continued. We close the port and this
    implicitly closes all LUNs under the port. The SCSI devices survive with
    their private zfcp_scsi_dev still holding a reference to the "removed"
    zfcp_port (still allocated but invisible in sysfs) [zfcp_get_port_by_wwpn
    in zfcp_scsi_slave_alloc]. This is not a problem as long as the fc_rport
    stays blocked. Once (auto) port scan brings back the removed port, we
    unblock its fc_rport again by design.  However, there is no mechanism that
    would recover (open) the LUNs under the port (no "ersfs_3" without
    zfcp_unit [zfcp_erp_strategy_followup_success]).  Any pending or new I/O to
    such LUN leads to repeated:
    
      Done: NEEDS_RETRY Result: hostbyte=DID_IMM_RETRY driverbyte=DRIVER_OK
    
    See also v4.10 commit 6f2ce1c6af37 ("scsi: zfcp: fix rport unblock race
    with LUN recovery"). Even a manual LUN recovery
    (echo 0 > /sys/bus/scsi/devices/H:C:T:L/zfcp_failed)
    does not help, as the LUN links to the old "removed" port which remains
    to lack ZFCP_STATUS_COMMON_RUNNING [zfcp_erp_required_act].
    The only workaround is to first ensure that the fc_rport is blocked
    (e.g. port_remove again in case it was re-discovered by (auto) port scan),
    then delete the SCSI devices, and finally re-discover by (auto) port scan.
    The port scan includes an fc_rport unblock, which in turn triggers
    a new scan on the scsi target to freshly get new pure auto scan LUNs.
    
    Fix this by rejecting port_remove also if there are SCSI devices
    (even without any zfcp_unit) under this port. Re-use mechanics from v3.7
    commit d99b601b6338 ("[SCSI] zfcp: restore refcount check on port_remove").
    However, we have to give up zfcp_sysfs_port_units_mutex earlier in unit_add
    to prevent a deadlock with scsi_host scan taking shost->scan_mutex first
    and then zfcp_sysfs_port_units_mutex now in our zfcp_scsi_slave_alloc().

    media: smsusb: better handle optional alignment
    
    commit a47686636d84eaec5c9c6e84bd5f96bed34d526d upstream.
    
    Most Siano devices require an alignment for the response.
    
    Changeset f3be52b0056a ("media: usb: siano: Fix general protection fault in smsusb")
    changed the logic with gets such aligment, but it now produces a
    sparce warning:
    
    drivers/media/usb/siano/smsusb.c: In function 'smsusb_init_device':
    drivers/media/usb/siano/smsusb.c:447:37: warning: 'in_maxp' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
      447 |   dev->response_alignment = in_maxp - sizeof(struct sms_msg_hdr);
          |                             ~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    The sparse message itself is bogus, but a broken (or fake) USB
    eeprom could produce a negative value for response_alignment.
    
    So, change the code in order to check if the result is not
    negative.

    media: usb: siano: Fix general protection fault in smsusb
    
    commit 31e0456de5be379b10fea0fa94a681057114a96e upstream.
    
    The syzkaller USB fuzzer found a general-protection-fault bug in the
    smsusb part of the Siano DVB driver.  The fault occurs during probe
    because the driver assumes without checking that the device has both
    IN and OUT endpoints and the IN endpoint is ep1.
    
    By slightly rearranging the driver's initialization code, we can make
    the appropriate checks early on and thus avoid the problem.  If the
    expected endpoints aren't present, the new code safely returns -ENODEV
    from the probe routine.

    Tracking this down shows that udev->bos is NULL in the following code:
    (xhci.c, in xhci_set_usb2_hardware_lpm)
            field = le32_to_cpu(udev->bos->ext_cap->bmAttributes);  <<<<<<< here

                            enable ? "enable" : "disable", port_num + 1);
    
            if (enable) {
                    /* Host supports BESL timeout instead of HIRD */
                    if (udev->usb2_hw_lpm_besl_capable) {
                            /* if device doesn't have a preferred BESL value use a
                             * default one which works with mixed HIRD and BESL
                             * systems. See XHCI_DEFAULT_BESL definition in xhci.h
                             */
                            if ((field & USB_BESL_SUPPORT) &&
                                (field & USB_BESL_BASELINE_VALID))
                                    hird = USB_GET_BESL_BASELINE(field);
                            else
                                    hird = udev->l1_params.besl;
    
    The failing case is when disabling LPM. So it is sufficient to avoid
    access to udev->bos by moving the instruction into the "enable" clause.

    xhci: Convert xhci_handshake() to use readl_poll_timeout_atomic()
    
    commit f7fac17ca925faa03fc5eb854c081a24075f8bad upstream.
    
    Xhci_handshake() implements the algorithm already captured by
    readl_poll_timeout_atomic(). Convert the former to use the latter to
    avoid repetition.
    
    Turned out this patch also fixes a bug on the AMD Stoneyridge platform
    where usleep(1) sometimes takes over 10ms.
    This means a 5 second timeout can easily take over 15 seconds which will
    trigger the watchdog and reboot the system.

    xhci: update bounce buffer with correct sg num
    
    commit 597c56e372dab2c7f79b8d700aad3a5deebf9d1b upstream.
    
    This change fixes a data corruption issue occurred on USB hard disk for
    the case that bounce buffer is used during transferring data.
    
    While updating data between sg list and bounce buffer, current
    implementation passes mapped sg number (urb->num_mapped_sgs) to
    sg_pcopy_from_buffer() and sg_pcopy_to_buffer(). This causes data
    not get copied if target buffer is located in the elements after
    mapped sg elements. This change passes sg number for full list to
    fix issue.
    
    Besides, for copying data from bounce buffer, calling dma_unmap_single()
    on the bounce buffer before copying data to sg list can avoid cache issue.

    include/linux/bitops.h: sanitize rotate primitives
    
    commit ef4d6f6b275c498f8e5626c99dbeefdc5027f843 upstream.
    
    The ror32 implementation (word >> shift) | (word << (32 - shift) has
    undefined behaviour if shift is outside the [1, 31] range.  Similarly
    for the 64 bit variants.  Most callers pass a compile-time constant
    (naturally in that range), but there's an UBSAN report that these may
    actually be called with a shift count of 0.
    
    Instead of special-casing that, we can make them DTRT for all values of
    shift while also avoiding UB.  For some reason, this was already partly
    done for rol32 (which was well-defined for [0, 31]).  gcc 8 recognizes
    these patterns as rotates, so for example
    
      __u32 rol32(__u32 word, unsigned int shift)
      {
            return (word << (shift & 31)) | (word >> ((-shift) & 31));
      }
    
    compiles to
    
    0000000000000020 <rol32>:
      20:   89 f8                   mov    %edi,%eax
      22:   89 f1                   mov    %esi,%ecx
      24:   d3 c0                   rol    %cl,%eax
      26:   c3                      retq
    
    Older compilers unfortunately do not do as well, but this only affects
    the small minority of users that don't pass constants.
    
    Due to integer promotions, ro[lr]8 were already well-defined for shifts
    in [0, 8], and ro[lr]16 were mostly well-defined for shifts in [0, 16]
    (only mostly - u16 gets promoted to _signed_ int, so if bit 15 is set,
    word << 16 is undefined).  For consistency, update those as well.

    commit d3c976c14ad8af421134c428b0a89ff8dd3bd8f8 upstream.
    
    Previously, %g2 would end up with the value PAGE_SIZE, but after the
    commit mentioned below it ends up with the value 1 due to being reused
    for a different purpose. We need it to be PAGE_SIZE as we use it to step
    through pages in our demap loop, otherwise we set different flags in the
    low 12 bits of the address written to, thereby doing things other than a
    nucleus page flush.

    tipc: fix modprobe tipc failed after switch order of device registration
    
    commit 526f5b851a96566803ee4bee60d0a34df56c77f8 upstream.
    
    Error message printed:
    modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'tipc': Address family not
    supported by protocol.
    when modprobe tipc after the following patch: switch order of
    device registration, commit 7e27e8d6130c
    ("tipc: switch order of device registration to fix a crash")
    
    Because sock_create_kern(net, AF_TIPC, ...) called by
    tipc_topsrv_create_listener() in the initialization process
    of tipc_init_net(), so tipc_socket_init() must be execute before that.
    Meanwhile, tipc_net_id need to be initialized when sock_create()
    called, and tipc_socket_init() is no need to be called for each namespace.
    
    I add a variable tipc_topsrv_net_ops, and split the
    register_pernet_subsys() of tipc into two parts, and split
    tipc_socket_init() with initialization of pernet params.
    
    By the way, I fixed resources rollback error when tipc_bcast_init()
    failed in tipc_init_net().

    xen/pciback: Don't disable PCI_COMMAND on PCI device reset.
    
    commit 7681f31ec9cdacab4fd10570be924f2cef6669ba upstream.
    
    There is no need for this at all. Worst it means that if
    the guest tries to write to BARs it could lead (on certain
    platforms) to PCI SERR errors.
    
    Please note that with af6fc858a35b90e89ea7a7ee58e66628c55c776b
    "xen-pciback: limit guest control of command register"
    a guest is still allowed to enable those control bits (safely), but
    is not allowed to disable them and that therefore a well behaved
    frontend which enables things before using them will still
    function correctly.
    
    This is done via an write to the configuration register 0x4 which
    triggers on the backend side:
    command_write
      \- pci_enable_device
         \- pci_enable_device_flags
            \- do_pci_enable_device
               \- pcibios_enable_device
                  \-pci_enable_resourcess
                    [which enables the PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY|PCI_COMMAND_IO]
    
    However guests (and drivers) which don't do this could cause
    problems, including the security issues which XSA-120 sought
    to address.

    crypto: vmx - ghash: do nosimd fallback manually
    
    commit 357d065a44cdd77ed5ff35155a989f2a763e96ef upstream.
    
    VMX ghash was using a fallback that did not support interleaving simd
    and nosimd operations, leading to failures in the extended test suite.
    
    If I understood correctly, Eric's suggestion was to use the same
    data format that the generic code uses, allowing us to call into it
    with the same contexts. I wasn't able to get that to work - I think
    there's a very different key structure and data layout being used.
    
    So instead steal the arm64 approach and perform the fallback
    operations directly if required.

    MVPP2_TXQ_SCHED_TOKEN_CNTR_REG() expects the logical queue id but
    the current code is passing the global tx queue offset, so it ends
    up writing to unknown registers (between 0x8280 and 0x82fc, which
    seemed to be unused by the hardware). This fixes the issue by using
    the logical queue id instead.

    bnxt_en: Fix aggregation buffer leak under OOM condition.
    
    [ Upstream commit 296d5b54163964b7ae536b8b57dfbd21d4e868e1 ]
    
    For every RX packet, the driver replenishes all buffers used for that
    packet and puts them back into the RX ring and RX aggregation ring.
    In one code path where the RX packet has one RX buffer and one or more
    aggregation buffers, we missed recycling the aggregation buffer(s) if
    we are unable to allocate a new SKB buffer.  This leads to the
    aggregation ring slowly running out of buffers over time.  Fix it
    by properly recycling the aggregation buffers.

    tipc: Avoid copying bytes beyond the supplied data
    
    TLV_SET is called with a data pointer and a len parameter that tells us
    how many bytes are pointed to by data. When invoking memcpy() we need
    to careful to only copy len bytes.
    
    Previously we would copy TLV_LENGTH(len) bytes which would copy an extra
    4 bytes past the end of the data pointer which newer GCC versions
    complain about.
    
     In file included from test.c:17:
     In function 'TLV_SET',
         inlined from 'test' at test.c:186:5:
     /usr/include/linux/tipc_config.h:317:3:

    We still want to ensure any padding bytes at the end are initialised, do
    this with a explicit memset() rather than copy bytes past the end of
    data. Apply the same logic to TCM_SET.

    The crash happens roughly 125..130ms after the disconnect. This
    correlates with the 'delay' timer that is started on certain USB tx/rx
    errors in the URB completion handler.
    
    The problem is a race of usbnet_stop() with usbnet_start_xmit(). In
    usbnet_stop() we call usbnet_terminate_urbs() to cancel all URBs in
    flight. This only makes sense if no new URBs are submitted
    concurrently, though. But the usbnet_start_xmit() can run at the same
    time on another CPU which almost unconditionally submits an URB. The
    error callback of the new URB will then schedule the timer after it was
    already stopped.
    
    The fix adds a check if the tx queue is stopped after the tx list lock
    has been taken. This should reliably prevent the submission of new URBs
    while usbnet_terminate_urbs() does its job. The same thing is done on
    the rx side even though it might be safe due to other flags that are
    checked there.

    net: stmmac: fix reset gpio free missing
    
    [ Upstream commit 49ce881c0d4c4a7a35358d9dccd5f26d0e56fc61 ]
    
    Commit 984203ceff27 ("net: stmmac: mdio: remove reset gpio free")
    removed the reset gpio free, when the driver is unbinded or rmmod,
    we miss the gpio free.
    
    This patch uses managed API to request the reset gpio, so that the
    gpio could be freed properly.

    net-gro: fix use-after-free read in napi_gro_frags()
    
    [ Upstream commit a4270d6795b0580287453ea55974d948393e66ef ]
    
    If a network driver provides to napi_gro_frags() an
    skb with a page fragment of exactly 14 bytes, the call
    to gro_pull_from_frag0() will 'consume' the fragment
    by calling skb_frag_unref(skb, 0), and the page might
    be freed and reused.
    
    Reading eth->h_proto at the end of napi_frags_skb() might
    read mangled data, or crash under specific debugging features.

    Fix the clk mismatch in the error path "failed_reset" because
    below error path will disable clk_ahb and clk_ipg directly, it
    should use pm_runtime_put_noidle() instead of pm_runtime_put()

    ipv6: Consider sk_bound_dev_if when binding a raw socket to an address
    
    [ Upstream commit 72f7cfab6f93a8ea825fab8ccfb016d064269f7f ]
    
    IPv6 does not consider if the socket is bound to a device when binding
    to an address. The result is that a socket can be bound to eth0 and
    then bound to the address of eth1. If the device is a VRF, the result
    is that a socket can only be bound to an address in the default VRF.
    
    Resolve by considering the device if sk_bound_dev_if is set.

    inet: switch IP ID generator to siphash
    
    [ Upstream commit df453700e8d81b1bdafdf684365ee2b9431fb702 ]
    
    According to Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas, IP ID generation is too weak
    and might be used by attackers.
    
    Even with recent net_hash_mix() fix (netns: provide pure entropy for net_hash_mix())
    having 64bit key and Jenkins hash is risky.
    
    It is time to switch to siphash and its 128bit keys.
