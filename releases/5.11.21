    sctp: delay auto_asconf init until binding the first addr
    
    commit 34e5b01186858b36c4d7c87e1a025071e8e2401f upstream.
    
    As Or Cohen described:
    
      If sctp_destroy_sock is called without sock_net(sk)->sctp.addr_wq_lock
      held and sp->do_auto_asconf is true, then an element is removed
      from the auto_asconf_splist without any proper locking.
    
      This can happen in the following functions:
      1. In sctp_accept, if sctp_sock_migrate fails.
      2. In inet_create or inet6_create, if there is a bpf program
         attached to BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE which denies
         creation of the sctp socket.
    
    This patch is to fix it by moving the auto_asconf init out of
    sctp_init_sock(), by which inet_create()/inet6_create() won't
    need to operate it in sctp_destroy_sock() when calling
    sk_common_release().
    
    It also makes more sense to do auto_asconf init while binding the
    first addr, as auto_asconf actually requires an ANY addr bind,
    see it in sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler().
    
    This addresses CVE-2021-23133.

    commit 01bfe5e8e428b475982a98a46cca5755726f3f7f upstream.
    
    This reverts commit b166a20b07382b8bc1dcee2a448715c9c2c81b5b.
    
    This one has to be reverted as it introduced a dead lock, as
    syzbot reported:
    
           CPU0                    CPU1

                                   lock(slock-AF_INET6);
                                   lock(&net->sctp.addr_wq_lock);
      lock(slock-AF_INET6);
    
    CPU0 is the thread of sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler(), and CPU1
    is that of sctp_close().
    
    The original issue this commit fixed will be fixed in the next
    patch.

    smp: Fix smp_call_function_single_async prototype
    
    commit 1139aeb1c521eb4a050920ce6c64c36c4f2a3ab7 upstream.
    
    As of commit 966a967116e6 ("smp: Avoid using two cache lines for struct
    call_single_data"), the smp code prefers 32-byte aligned call_single_data
    objects for performance reasons, but the block layer includes an instance
    of this structure in the main 'struct request' that is more senstive
    to size than to performance here, see 4ccafe032005 ("block: unalign
    call_single_data in struct request").
    
    The result is a violation of the calling conventions that clang correctly
    points out:
    
    block/blk-mq.c:630:39: warning: passing 8-byte aligned argument to 32-byte aligned parameter 2 of 'smp_call_function_single_async' may result in an unaligned pointer access [-Walign-mismatch]
                    smp_call_function_single_async(cpu, &rq->csd);
    
    It does seem that the usage of the call_single_data without cache line
    alignment should still be allowed by the smp code, so just change the
    function prototype so it accepts both, but leave the default alignment
    unchanged for the other users. This seems better to me than adding
    a local hack to shut up an otherwise correct warning in the caller.

    net: Only allow init netns to set default tcp cong to a restricted algo
    
    commit 8d432592f30fcc34ef5a10aac4887b4897884493 upstream.
    
    tcp_set_default_congestion_control() is netns-safe in that it writes
    to &net->ipv4.tcp_congestion_control, but it also sets
    ca->flags |= TCP_CONG_NON_RESTRICTED which is not namespaced.
    This has the unintended side-effect of changing the global
    net.ipv4.tcp_allowed_congestion_control sysctl, despite the fact that it
    is read-only: 97684f0970f6 ("net: Make tcp_allowed_congestion_control
    readonly in non-init netns")
    
    Resolve this netns "leak" by only allowing the init netns to set the
    default algorithm to one that is restricted. This restriction could be
    removed if tcp_allowed_congestion_control were namespace-ified in the
    future.
    
    This bug was uncovered with
    https://github.com/JonathonReinhart/linux-netns-sysctl-verify

    bpf: Prevent writable memory-mapping of read-only ringbuf pages
    
    commit 04ea3086c4d73da7009de1e84962a904139af219 upstream.
    
    Only the very first page of BPF ringbuf that contains consumer position
    counter is supposed to be mapped as writeable by user-space. Producer
    position is read-only and can be modified only by the kernel code. BPF ringbuf
    data pages are read-only as well and are not meant to be modified by
    user-code to maintain integrity of per-record headers.
    
    This patch allows to map only consumer position page as writeable and
    everything else is restricted to be read-only. remap_vmalloc_range()
    internally adds VM_DONTEXPAND, so all the established memory mappings can't be
    extended, which prevents any future violations through mremap()'ing.

    bpf: Fix alu32 const subreg bound tracking on bitwise operations
    
    commit 049c4e13714ecbca567b4d5f6d563f05d431c80e upstream.
    
    Fix a bug in the verifier's scalar32_min_max_*() functions which leads to
    incorrect tracking of 32 bit bounds for the simulation of and/or/xor bitops.
    When both the src & dst subreg is a known constant, then the assumption is
    that scalar_min_max_*() will take care to update bounds correctly. However,
    this is not the case, for example, consider a register R2 which has a tnum
    of 0xffffffff00000000, meaning, lower 32 bits are known constant and in this
    case of value 0x00000001. R2 is then and'ed with a register R3 which is a
    64 bit known constant, here, 0x100000002.
    
    What can be seen in line '10:' is that 32 bit bounds reach an invalid state
    where {u,s}32_min_value > {u,s}32_max_value. The reason is scalar32_min_max_*()
    delegates 32 bit bounds updates to scalar_min_max_*(), however, that really
    only takes place when both the 64 bit src & dst register is a known constant.
    Given scalar32_min_max_*() is intended to be designed as closely as possible
    to scalar_min_max_*(), update the 32 bit bounds in this situation through
    __mark_reg32_known() which will set all {u,s}32_{min,max}_value to the correct
    constant, which is 0x00000000 after the fix (given 0x00000001 & 0x00000002 in
    32 bit space). This is possible given var32_off already holds the final value
    as dst_reg->var_off is updated before calling scalar32_min_max_*().
    
    Before fix, invalid tracking of R2:

    afs: Fix speculative status fetches
    
    [ Upstream commit 22650f148126571be1098d34160eb4931fc77241 ]
    
    The generic/464 xfstest causes kAFS to emit occasional warnings of the
    form:
    
            kAFS: vnode modified {100055:8a} 30->31 YFS.StoreData64 (c=6015)
    
    This indicates that the data version received back from the server did not
    match the expected value (the DV should be incremented monotonically for
    each individual modification op committed to a vnode).
    
    What is happening is that a lookup call is doing a bulk status fetch
    speculatively on a bunch of vnodes in a directory besides getting the
    status of the vnode it's actually interested in.  This is racing with a
    StoreData operation (though it could also occur with, say, a MakeDir op).
    
    On the client, a modification operation locks the vnode, but the bulk
    status fetch only locks the parent directory, so no ordering is imposed
    there (thereby avoiding an avenue to deadlock).
    
    On the server, the StoreData op handler doesn't lock the vnode until it's
    received all the request data, and downgrades the lock after committing the
    data until it has finished sending change notifications to other clients -
    which allows the status fetch to occur before it has finished.
    
    This means that:
    
     - a status fetch can access the target vnode either side of the exclusive
       section of the modification
    
     - the status fetch could start before the modification, yet finish after,
       and vice-versa.
    
     - the status fetch and the modification RPCs can complete in either order.
    
     - the status fetch can return either the before or the after DV from the
       modification.
    
     - the status fetch might regress the locally cached DV.
    
    Some of these are handled by the previous fix[1], but that's not sufficient
    because it checks the DV it received against the DV it cached at the start
    of the op, but the DV might've been updated in the meantime by a locally
    generated modification op.
    
    Fix this by the following means:
    
     (1) Keep track of when we're performing a modification operation on a
         vnode.  This is done by marking vnode parameters with a 'modification'
         note that causes the AFS_VNODE_MODIFYING flag to be set on the vnode
         for the duration.
    
     (2) Alter the speculation race detection to ignore speculative status
         fetches if either the vnode is marked as being modified or the data
         version number is not what we expected.
    
    Note that whilst the "vnode modified" warning does get recovered from as it
    causes the client to refetch the status at the next opportunity, it will
    also invalidate the pagecache, so changes might get lost.

    All slab objects are charged with the new APIs of obj_cgroup.  The new
    APIs introduce a struct obj_cgroup to charge slab objects.  It prevents
    long-living objects from pinning the original memory cgroup in the
    memory.  But there are still some corner objects (e.g.  allocations
    larger than order-1 page on SLUB) which are not charged with the new
    APIs.  Those objects (include the pages which are allocated from buddy
    allocator directly) are charged as kmem pages which still hold a
    reference to the memory cgroup.
    
    E.g.  We know that the kernel stack is charged as kmem pages because the
    size of the kernel stack can be greater than 2 pages (e.g.  16KB on
    x86_64 or arm64).  If we create a thread (suppose the thread stack is
    charged to memory cgroup A) and then move it from memory cgroup A to
    memory cgroup B.  Because the kernel stack of the thread hold a
    reference to the memory cgroup A.  The thread can pin the memory cgroup
    A in the memory even if we remove the cgroup A.  If we want to see this
    scenario by using the following script.  We can see that the system has
    added 500 dying cgroups (This is not a real world issue, just a script
    to show that the large kmallocs are charged as kmem pages which can pin
    the memory cgroup in the memory).
    
            #!/bin/bash
    
            cat /proc/cgroups | grep memory
    
            cd /sys/fs/cgroup/memory
            echo 1 > memory.move_charge_at_immigrate
    
            for i in range{1..500}
            do
                    mkdir kmem_test
                    echo $$ > kmem_test/cgroup.procs
                    sleep 3600 &
                    echo $$ > cgroup.procs
                    echo `cat kmem_test/cgroup.procs` > cgroup.procs
                    rmdir kmem_test
            done
    
            cat /proc/cgroups | grep memory
    
    This patchset aims to make those kmem pages to drop the reference to
    memory cgroup by using the APIs of obj_cgroup.  Finally, we can see that
    the number of the dying cgroups will not increase if we run the above test
    script.
    
    This patch (of 7):
    
    The rcu_read_lock/unlock only can guarantee that the memcg will not be
    freed, but it cannot guarantee the success of css_get (which is in the
    refill_stock when cached memcg changed) to memcg.
    
      rcu_read_lock()
      memcg = obj_cgroup_memcg(old)
      __memcg_kmem_uncharge(memcg)
          refill_stock(memcg)
              if (stock->cached != memcg)
                  // css_get can change the ref counter from 0 back to 1.
                  css_get(&memcg->css)
      rcu_read_unlock()
    
    This fix is very like the commit:
    
      eefbfa7fd678 ("mm: memcg/slab: fix use after free in obj_cgroup_charge")
    
    Fix this by holding a reference to the memcg which is passed to the
    __memcg_kmem_uncharge() before calling __memcg_kmem_uncharge().

    kfifo: fix ternary sign extension bugs
    
    [ Upstream commit 926ee00ea24320052b46745ef4b00d91c05bd03d ]
    
    The intent with this code was to return negative error codes but instead
    it returns positives.
    
    The problem is how type promotion works with ternary operations.  These
    functions return long, "ret" is an int and "copied" is a u32.  The
    negative error code is first cast to u32 so it becomes a high positive and
    then cast to long where it's still a positive.
    
    We could fix this by declaring "ret" as a ssize_t but let's just get rid
    of the ternaries instead.

    Since commit d110162cafc8 ("perf tsc: Support cap_user_time_short for
    event TIME_CONV"), the event PERF_RECORD_TIME_CONV has extended the data
    structure for clock parameters.
    
    To be backwards-compatible, this patch adds a dedicated swap operation
    for the event PERF_RECORD_TIME_CONV, based on checking if the event
    contains field "time_cycles", it can support both for the old and new
    event formats.

    perf jit: Let convert_timestamp() to be backwards-compatible
    
    [ Upstream commit aa616f5a8a2d22a179d5502ebd85045af66fa656 ]
    
    Commit d110162cafc80dad ("perf tsc: Support cap_user_time_short for
    event TIME_CONV") supports the extended parameters for event TIME_CONV,
    but it broke the backwards compatibility, so any perf data file with old
    event format fails to convert timestamp.
    
    This patch introduces a helper event_contains() to check if an event
    contains a specific member or not.  For the backwards-compatibility, if
    the event size confirms the extended parameters are supported in the
    event TIME_CONV, then copies these parameters.
    
    Committer notes:
    
    To make this compiler backwards compatible add this patch:
    
      -       struct perf_tsc_conversion tc = { 0 };
      +       struct perf_tsc_conversion tc = { .time_shift = 0, };

    perf tools: Change fields type in perf_record_time_conv
    
    [ Upstream commit e1d380ea8b00db4bb14d1f513000d4b62aa9d3f0 ]
    
    C standard claims "An object declared as type _Bool is large enough to
    store the values 0 and 1", bool type size can be 1 byte or larger than
    1 byte.  Thus it's uncertian for bool type size with different
    compilers.
    
    This patch changes the bool type in structure perf_record_time_conv to
    __u8 type, and pads extra bytes for 8-byte alignment; this can give
    reliable structure size.

    [ Upstream commit 6066234aa33850e9e35e7be82d92b9e9091e774b ]
    
    The .serdes_get_lane op used the magic value 0xff to indicate a valid
    SERDES lane and 0 signaled that a non-SERDES mode was set on the port.
    
    Unfortunately, "0" is also a valid lane ID, so even when these ports
    where configured to e.g. RGMII the driver would set them up as SERDES
    ports.
    
    - Replace 0xff with 0 to indicate a valid lane ID. The number is on
      the one hand just as arbitrary, but it is at least the first valid one
      and therefore less of a surprise.
    
    - Follow the other .serdes_get_lane implementations and return -ENODEV
      in the case where no SERDES is assigned to the port.

    net: bridge: mcast: fix broken length + header check for MRDv6 Adv.
    
    [ Upstream commit 99014088156cd78867d19514a0bc771c4b86b93b ]
    
    The IPv6 Multicast Router Advertisements parsing has the following two
    issues:
    
    For one thing, ICMPv6 MRD Advertisements are smaller than ICMPv6 MLD
    messages (ICMPv6 MRD Adv.: 8 bytes vs. ICMPv6 MLDv1/2: >= 24 bytes,
    assuming MLDv2 Reports with at least one multicast address entry).
    When ipv6_mc_check_mld_msg() tries to parse an Multicast Router
    Advertisement its MLD length check will fail - and it will wrongly
    return -EINVAL, even if we have a valid MRD Advertisement. With the
    returned -EINVAL the bridge code will assume a broken packet and will
    wrongly discard it, potentially leading to multicast packet loss towards
    multicast routers.
    
    The second issue is the MRD header parsing in
    br_ip6_multicast_mrd_rcv(): It wrongly checks for an ICMPv6 header
    immediately after the IPv6 header (IPv6 next header type). However
    according to RFC4286, section 2 all MRD messages contain a Router Alert
    option (just like MLD). So instead there is an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option
    for the Router Alert between the IPv6 and ICMPv6 header, again leading
    to the bridge wrongly discarding Multicast Router Advertisements.
    
    To fix these two issues, introduce a new return value -ENODATA to
    ipv6_mc_check_mld() to indicate a valid ICMPv6 packet with a hop-by-hop
    option which is not an MLD but potentially an MRD packet. This also
    simplifies further parsing in the bridge code, as ipv6_mc_check_mld()
    already fully checks the ICMPv6 header and hop-by-hop option.
    
    These issues were found and fixed with the help of the mrdisc tool
    (https://github.com/troglobit/mrdisc).

    RDMA/siw: Fix a use after free in siw_alloc_mr
    
    [ Upstream commit 3093ee182f01689b89e9f8797b321603e5de4f63 ]
    
    Our code analyzer reported a UAF.
    
    In siw_alloc_mr(), it calls siw_mr_add_mem(mr,..). In the implementation of
    siw_mr_add_mem(), mem is assigned to mr->mem and then mem is freed via
    kfree(mem) if xa_alloc_cyclic() failed. Here, mr->mem still point to a
    freed object. After, the execution continue up to the err_out branch of
    siw_alloc_mr, and the freed mr->mem is used in siw_mr_drop_mem(mr).

    bpf: Fix propagation of 32 bit unsigned bounds from 64 bit bounds
    
    [ Upstream commit 10bf4e83167cc68595b85fd73bb91e8f2c086e36 ]
    
    Similarly as b02709587ea3 ("bpf: Fix propagation of 32-bit signed bounds
    from 64-bit bounds."), we also need to fix the propagation of 32 bit
    unsigned bounds from 64 bit counterparts. That is, really only set the
    u32_{min,max}_value when /both/ {umin,umax}_value safely fit in 32 bit
    space. For example, the register with a umin_value == 1 does /not/ imply
    that u32_min_value is also equal to 1, since umax_value could be much
    larger than 32 bit subregister can hold, and thus u32_min_value is in
    the interval [0,1] instead.
    
    Before fix, invalid tracking result of R2_w=inv1:
    
      [...]
      5: R0_w=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2_w=inv(id=0) R10=fp0
      5: (35) if r2 >= 0x1 goto pc+1
      [...] // goto path
      7: R0=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2=inv(id=0,umin_value=1) R10=fp0
      7: (b6) if w2 <= 0x1 goto pc+1
      [...] // goto path
      9: R0=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2=inv(id=0,smin_value=-9223372036854775807,smax_value=9223372032559808513,umin_value=1,umax_value=18446744069414584321,var_off=(0x1; 0xffffffff00000000),s32_min_value=1,s32_max_value=1,u32_max_value=1) R10=fp0
      9: (bc) w2 = w2
      10: R0=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2_w=inv1 R10=fp0
      [...]
    
    After fix, correct tracking result of R2_w=inv(id=0,umax_value=1,var_off=(0x0; 0x1)):
    
      [...]
      5: R0_w=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2_w=inv(id=0) R10=fp0
      5: (35) if r2 >= 0x1 goto pc+1
      [...] // goto path
      7: R0=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2=inv(id=0,umin_value=1) R10=fp0
      7: (b6) if w2 <= 0x1 goto pc+1
      [...] // goto path
      9: R0=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2=inv(id=0,smax_value=9223372032559808513,umax_value=18446744069414584321,var_off=(0x0; 0xffffffff00000001),s32_min_value=0,s32_max_value=1,u32_max_value=1) R10=fp0
      9: (bc) w2 = w2
      10: R0=inv1337 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R2_w=inv(id=0,umax_value=1,var_off=(0x0; 0x1)) R10=fp0
      [...]
    
    Thus, same issue as in b02709587ea3 holds for unsigned subregister tracking.
    Also, align __reg64_bound_u32() similarly to __reg64_bound_s32() as done in
    b02709587ea3 to make them uniform again.

    Fix failed tests checks in core_reloc test runner, which allowed failing tests
    to pass quietly. Also add extra check to make sure that expected to fail test cases with
    invalid names are caught as test failure anyway, as this is not an expected
    failure mode. Also fix mislabeled probed vs direct bitfield test cases.

    selftests/bpf: Fix field existence CO-RE reloc tests
    
    [ Upstream commit 5a30eb23922b52f33222c6729b6b3ff1c37a6c66 ]
    
    Negative field existence cases for have a broken assumption that FIELD_EXISTS
    CO-RE relo will fail for fields that match the name but have incompatible type
    signature. That's not how CO-RE relocations generally behave. Types and fields
    that match by name but not by expected type are treated as non-matching
    candidates and are skipped. Error later is reported if no matching candidate
    was found. That's what happens for most relocations, but existence relocations
    (FIELD_EXISTS and TYPE_EXISTS) are more permissive and they are designed to
    return 0 or 1, depending if a match is found. This allows to handle
    name-conflicting but incompatible types in BPF code easily. Combined with
    ___flavor suffixes, it's possible to handle pretty much any structural type
    changes in kernel within the compiled once BPF source code.
    
    So, long story short, negative field existence test cases are invalid in their
    assumptions, so this patch reworks them into a single consolidated positive
    case that doesn't match any of the fields.

    selftests/bpf: Fix BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD() macro
    
    [ Upstream commit 0f20615d64ee2ad5e2a133a812382d0c4071589b ]
    
    Fix BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD() macro used for reading CO-RE-relocatable
    bitfields. Missing breaks in a switch caused 8-byte reads always. This can
    confuse libbpf because it does strict checks that memory load size corresponds
    to the original size of the field, which in this case quite often would be
    wrong.
    
    After fixing that, we run into another problem, which quite subtle, so worth
    documenting here. The issue is in Clang optimization and CO-RE relocation
    interactions. Without that asm volatile construct (also known as
    barrier_var()), Clang will re-order BYTE_OFFSET and BYTE_SIZE relocations and
    will apply BYTE_OFFSET 4 times for each switch case arm. This will result in
    the same error from libbpf about mismatch of memory load size and original
    field size. I.e., if we were reading u32, we'd still have *(u8 *), *(u16 *),
    *(u32 *), and *(u64 *) memory loads, three of which will fail. Using
    barrier_var() forces Clang to apply BYTE_OFFSET relocation first (and once) to
    calculate p, after which value of p is used without relocation in each of
    switch case arms, doing appropiately-sized memory load.
    
    Here's the list of relevant relocations and pieces of generated BPF code
    before and after this patch for test_core_reloc_bitfields_direct selftests.

    dev_kfree_skb(skb) in error branch of emac_tx_fill_tpd().
    But the freed skb is still used via skb->len by netdev_sent_queue(,skb->len).
    
    As i observed that emac_tx_fill_tpd() haven't modified the value of skb->len,
    thus my patch assigns skb->len to 'len' before the possible free and
    use 'len' instead of skb->len later.

    KVM: SVM: Disable SEV/SEV-ES if NPT is disabled
    
    [ Upstream commit fa13680f5668cff05302a2f4753c49334a83a064 ]
    
    Disable SEV and SEV-ES if NPT is disabled.  While the APM doesn't clearly
    state that NPT is mandatory, it's alluded to by:
    
      The guest page tables, managed by the guest, may mark data memory pages
      as either private or shared, thus allowing selected pages to be shared
      outside the guest.
    
    And practically speaking, shadow paging can't work since KVM can't read
    the guest's page tables.

    KVM: SVM: Free sev_asid_bitmap during init if SEV setup fails
    
    [ Upstream commit f31b88b35f90f6b7ae4abc1015494a285f459221 ]
    
    Free sev_asid_bitmap if the reclaim bitmap allocation fails, othwerise
    KVM will unnecessarily keep the bitmap when SEV is not fully enabled.
    
    Freeing the page is also necessary to avoid introducing a bug when a
    future patch eliminates svm_sev_enabled() in favor of using the global
    'sev' flag directly.  While sev_hardware_enabled() checks max_sev_asid,
    which is true even if KVM setup fails, 'sev' will be true if and only
    if KVM setup fully succeeds.

    KVM: SVM: Zero out the VMCB array used to track SEV ASID association
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b1902b87bf11f1c6a84368470dc13da6f3da3bd ]
    
    Zero out the array of VMCB pointers so that pre_sev_run() won't see
    garbage when querying the array to detect when an SEV ASID is being
    associated with a new VMCB.  In practice, reading random values is all
    but guaranteed to be benign as a false negative (which is extremely
    unlikely on its own) can only happen on CPU0 on the first VMRUN and would
    only cause KVM to skip the ASID flush.  For anything bad to happen, a
    previous instance of KVM would have to exit without flushing the ASID,
    _and_ KVM would have to not flush the ASID at any time while building the
    new SEV guest.

    [ Upstream commit dbdd096a5a74b94f6b786a47baef2085859b0dce ]
    
    Disable pass-through of the FS and GS base MSRs for 32-bit KVM.  Intel's
    SDM unequivocally states that the MSRs exist if and only if the CPU
    supports x86-64.  FS_BASE and GS_BASE are mostly a non-issue; a clever
    guest could opportunistically use the MSRs without issue.  KERNEL_GS_BASE
    is a bigger problem, as a clever guest would subtly be broken if it were
    migrated, as KVM disallows software access to the MSRs, and unlike the
    direct variants, KERNEL_GS_BASE needs to be explicitly migrated as it's
    not captured in the VMCS.

    bnxt_en: Fix RX consumer index logic in the error path.
    
    [ Upstream commit bbd6f0a948139970f4a615dff189d9a503681a39 ]
    
    In bnxt_rx_pkt(), the RX buffers are expected to complete in order.
    If the RX consumer index indicates an out of order buffer completion,
    it means we are hitting a hardware bug and the driver will abort all
    remaining RX packets and reset the RX ring.  The RX consumer index
    that we pass to bnxt_discard_rx() is not correct.  We should be
    passing the current index (tmp_raw_cons) instead of the old index
    (raw_cons).  This bug can cause us to be at the wrong index when
    trying to abort the next RX packet.  It can crash like this:

    [ Upstream commit c8d0260cdd96fdccdef0509c4160e28a1012a5d7 ]
    
    The FDB roaming test installs a destination MAC address on the wrong
    interface of an FDB database and tests whether the mirroring fails, because
    packets are sent to the wrong port. The test by mistake installs the FDB
    entry as local. This worked previously, because drivers were notified of
    local FDB entries in the same way as of static entries. However that has
    been fixed in the commit 6ab4c3117aec ("net: bridge: don't notify switchdev
    for local FDB addresses"), and local entries are not notified anymore. As a
    result, the HW is not reconfigured for the FDB roam, and mirroring keeps
    working, failing the test.
    
    To fix the issue, mark the FDB entry as static.

    IPv4 over geneve6: PMTU exceptions - nexthop objects

    The problem is that bnxt_show_temp() returns long but "rc" is an int
    and "len" is a u32.  With ternary operations the type promotion is quite
    tricky.  The negative "rc" is first promoted to u32 and then to long so
    it ends up being a high positive value instead of a a negative as we
    intended.

    Memory events (mem-loads and mem-stores) currently use the threshold
    event selection as issue to finish. Power10 supports issue to complete
    as part of thresholding which is more appropriate for mem-loads and
    mem-stores. Hence fix the event code for memory events to use issue
    to complete.

    [ Upstream commit 7dd9a40fd6e0d0f1fd8e1931c007e080801dfdce ]
    
    When the error check in ath9k_hw_read_revisions() was added, it checked for
    -EIO which is what ath9k_regread() in the ath9k_htc driver uses. However,
    for plain ath9k, the register read function uses ioread32(), which just
    returns -1 on error. So if such a read fails, it still gets passed through
    and ends up as a weird mac revision in the log output.
    
    Fix this by changing ath9k_regread() to return -1 on error like ioread32()
    does, and fix the error check to look for that instead of -EIO.

    [ Upstream commit 357a07c26697a770d39d28b6b111f978deb4017d ]
    
    The Intel xway phys offer the possibility to deactivate the integrated
    LED function and to control the LEDs manually.
    If this was set by the bootloader, it must be ensured that the
    integrated LED function is enabled for all LEDs when loading the driver.
    
    Before commit 6e2d85ec0559 ("net: phy: Stop with excessive soft reset")
    the LEDs were enabled by a soft-reset of the PHY (using
    genphy_soft_reset). Initialize the XWAY_MDIO_LED with it's default
    value (which is applied during a soft reset) instead of adding back
    the soft reset. This brings back the default LED configuration while
    still preventing an excessive amount of soft resets.

    net: renesas: ravb: Fix a stuck issue when a lot of frames are received
    
    [ Upstream commit 5718458b092bf6bf4482c5df32affba3c3259517 ]
    
    When a lot of frames were received in the short term, the driver
    caused a stuck of receiving until a new frame was received. For example,
    the following command from other device could cause this issue.
    
        $ sudo ping -f -l 1000 -c 1000 <this driver's ipaddress>
    
    The previous code always cleared the interrupt flag of RX but checks
    the interrupt flags in ravb_poll(). So, ravb_poll() could not call
    ravb_rx() in the next time until a new RX frame was received if
    ravb_rx() returned true. To fix the issue, always calls ravb_rx()
    regardless the interrupt flags condition.

    [ Upstream commit 74c1f1366eb7714b8b211554f6c5cee315ff3fbc ]
    
    Explicitly reject using pointers that are not virt_to_phys() friendly
    as the source for SEV commands that are sent to the PSP.  The PSP works
    with physical addresses, and __pa()/virt_to_phys() will not return the
    correct address in these cases, e.g. for a vmalloc'd pointer.  At best,
    the bogus address will cause the command to fail, and at worst lead to
    system instability.
    
    While it's unlikely that callers will deliberately use a bad pointer for
    SEV buffers, a caller can easily use a vmalloc'd pointer unknowingly when
    running with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y as it's not obvious that putting the
    command buffers on the stack would be bad.  The command buffers are
    relative  small and easily fit on the stack, and the APIs to do not
    document that the incoming pointer must be a physically contiguous,
    __pa() friendly pointer.

    As of today, if the DDW is big enough to fit (1 << MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS)
    it's possible to use direct DMA mapping even with pmem region.
    
    But, if that happens, the window size (len) is set to (MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS
    - page_shift) instead of MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS, causing a pagesize times
    smaller DDW to be created, being insufficient for correct usage.
    
    Fix this so the correct window size is used in this case.

    currently the incorrect post-right shifted values, fix this by setting

    net: marvell: prestera: fix port event handling on init
    
    [ Upstream commit 333980481b99edb24ebd5d1a53af70a15d9146de ]
    
    For some reason there might be a crash during ports creation if port
    events are handling at the same time  because fw may send initial
    port event with down state.
    
    The crash points to cancel_delayed_work() which is called when port went
    is down.  Currently I did not find out the real cause of the issue, so
    fixed it by cancel port stats work only if previous port's state was up
    & runnig.
    
    The following is the crash which can be triggered:

    vsock/virtio: free queued packets when closing socket
    
    [ Upstream commit 8432b8114957235f42e070a16118a7f750de9d39 ]
    
    As reported by syzbot [1], there is a memory leak while closing the
    socket. We partially solved this issue with commit ac03046ece2b
    ("vsock/virtio: free packets during the socket release"), but we
    forgot to drain the RX queue when the socket is definitely closed by
    the scheduled work.
    
    To avoid future issues, let's use the new virtio_transport_remove_sock()
    to drain the RX queue before removing the socket from the af_vsock lists
    calling vsock_remove_sock().

     efx_channel_get_tx_queue() is inappropriate.  This worked by chance,

    Currently when the call to usb_urb_ep_type_check fails (returning -EINVAL)
    the error return path returns -ENOMEM via the exit label "error". Other
    uses of the same error exit label set the err variable to -ENOMEM but this
    is not being used.  I believe the original intent was for the error exit
    path to return the value in err rather than the hard coded -ENOMEM, so
    return this rather than the hard coded -ENOMEM.

    gro: fix napi_gro_frags() Fast GRO breakage due to IP alignment check
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ad18ff6449cbd6beb26b53128ddf56d2685aa93 ]
    
    Commit 38ec4944b593 ("gro: ensure frag0 meets IP header alignment")
    did the right thing, but missed the fact that napi_gro_frags() logics
    calls for skb_gro_reset_offset() *before* pulling Ethernet header
    to the skb linear space.
    That said, the introduced check for frag0 address being aligned to 4
    always fails for it as Ethernet header is obviously 14 bytes long,
    and in case with NET_IP_ALIGN its start is not aligned to 4.
    
    Fix this by adding @nhoff argument to skb_gro_reset_offset() which
    tells if an IP header is placed right at the start of frag0 or not.
    This restores Fast GRO for napi_gro_frags() that became very slow
    after the mentioned commit, and preserves the introduced check to
    avoid silent unaligned accesses.
    
    From v1 [0]:
     - inline tiny skb_gro_reset_offset() to let the code be optimized
       more efficively (esp. for the !NET_IP_ALIGN case) (Eric);
     - pull in Reviewed-by from Eric.

    [ Upstream commit e16edc99d658cd41c60a44cc14d170697aa3271f ]
    
    VMCI feature is not supported in conjunction with the vSphere Fault
    Tolerance (FT) feature.
    
    VMware Tools can repeatedly try to create a vsock connection. If FT is
    enabled the kernel logs is flooded with the following messages:
    
        qp_alloc_hypercall result = -20
        Could not attach to queue pair with -20
    
    "qp_alloc_hypercall result = -20" was hidden by commit e8266c4c3307
    ("VMCI: Stop log spew when qp allocation isn't possible"), but "Could
    not attach to queue pair with -20" is still there flooding the log.
    
    Since the error message can be useful in some cases, print it only once.

    netfilter: nftables_offload: special ethertype handling for VLAN
    
    [ Upstream commit 783003f3bb8a565326e89d18bbd948ad8ffc816a ]
    
    The nftables offload parser sets FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_BASIC .n_proto to the
    ethertype field in the ethertype frame. However:
    
    - FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_BASIC .n_proto field always stores either IPv4 or IPv6
      ethertypes.
    - FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_VLAN .vlan_tpid stores either the 802.1q and 802.1ad
      ethertypes. Same as for FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_CVLAN.
    
    This function adjusts the flow dissector to handle two scenarios:
    
    1) FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_VLAN .vlan_tpid is set to 802.1q or 802.1ad.
       Then, transfer:
       - the .n_proto field to FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_VLAN .tpid.
       - the original FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_VLAN .tpid to the
         FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_CVLAN .tpid
       - the original FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_CVLAN .tpid to the .n_proto field.
    
    2) .n_proto is set to 802.1q or 802.1ad. Then, transfer:
       - the .n_proto field to FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_VLAN .tpid.
       - the original FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_VLAN .tpid to the .n_proto field.

    mwl8k: Fix a double Free in mwl8k_probe_hw
    
    [ Upstream commit a8e083ee8e2a6c94c29733835adae8bf5b832748 ]
    
    In mwl8k_probe_hw, hw->priv->txq is freed at the first time by
    dma_free_coherent() in the call chain:
    if(!priv->ap_fw)->mwl8k_init_txqs(hw)->mwl8k_txq_init(hw, i).
    
    Then in err_free_queues of mwl8k_probe_hw, hw->priv->txq is freed
    at the second time by mwl8k_txq_deinit(hw, i)->dma_free_coherent().
    
    My patch set txq->txd to NULL after the first free to avoid the
    double free.

    powerpc/smp: Reintroduce cpu_core_mask
    
    [ Upstream commit c47f892d7aa62765bf0689073f75990b4517a4cf ]
    
    Daniel reported that with Commit 4ca234a9cbd7 ("powerpc/smp: Stop
    updating cpu_core_mask") QEMU was unable to set single NUMA node SMP
    topologies such as:
     -smp 8,maxcpus=8,cores=2,threads=2,sockets=2
     i.e he expected 2 sockets in one NUMA node.
    
    The above commit helped to reduce boot time on Large Systems for
    example 4096 vCPU single socket QEMU instance. PAPR is silent on
    having more than one socket within a NUMA node.
    
    cpu_core_mask and cpu_cpu_mask for any CPU would be same unless the
    number of sockets is different from the number of NUMA nodes.
    
    One option is to reintroduce cpu_core_mask but use a slightly
    different method to arrive at the cpu_core_mask. Previously each CPU's
    chip-id would be compared with all other CPU's chip-id to verify if
    both the CPUs were related at the chip level. Now if a CPU 'A' is
    found related / (unrelated) to another CPU 'B', all the thread
    siblings of 'A' and thread siblings of 'B' are automatically marked as
    related / (unrelated).
    
    Also if a platform doesn't support ibm,chip-id property, i.e its
    cpu_to_chip_id returns -1, cpu_core_map holds a copy of
    cpu_cpu_mask().

    MIPS: pci-legacy: stop using of_pci_range_to_resource
    
    [ Upstream commit 3ecb9dc1581eebecaee56decac70e35365260866 ]
    
    Mirror commit aeba3731b150 ("powerpc/pci: Fix IO space breakage after
    of_pci_range_to_resource() change").
    
    Most MIPS platforms do not define PCI_IOBASE, nor implement
    pci_address_to_pio(). Moreover, IO_SPACE_LIMIT is 0xffff for most MIPS
    platforms. of_pci_range_to_resource passes the _start address_ of the IO
    range into pci_address_to_pio, which then checks it against
    IO_SPACE_LIMIT and fails, because for MIPS platforms that use
    pci-legacy (pci-lantiq, pci-rt3883, pci-mt7620), IO ranges start much
    higher than 0xffff.
    
    In fact, pci-mt7621 in staging already works around this problem, see
    commit 09dd629eeabb ("staging: mt7621-pci: fix io space and properly set
    resource limits")
    
    So just stop using of_pci_range_to_resource, which does not work for
    MIPS.
    
    Fixes PCI errors like:
      pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0xffffffff]

    drm/i915/gvt: Fix error code in intel_gvt_init_device()
    
    [ Upstream commit 329328ec6a87f2c1275f50d979d55513de458409 ]
    
    The intel_gvt_init_vgpu_type_groups() function is only called from
    intel_gvt_init_device().  If it fails then the intel_gvt_init_device()
    prints the error code and propagates it back again.  That's a bug
    because false is zero/success.  The fix is to modify it to return zero
    or negative error codes and make everything consistent.

    [ Upstream commit 94f633ea8ade8418634d152ad0931133338226f6 ]
    
    af_packet fanout uses RCU rules to ensure f->arr elements
    are not dismantled before RCU grace period.
    
    However, it lacks rcu accessors to make sure KCSAN and other tools
    wont detect data races. Stupid compilers could also play games.

    powerpc/xive: Fix xmon command "dxi"
    
    [ Upstream commit 33e4bc5946432a4ac173fd08e8e30a13ab94d06d ]
    
    When under xmon, the "dxi" command dumps the state of the XIVE
    interrupts. If an interrupt number is specified, only the state of
    the associated XIVE interrupt is dumped. This form of the command
    lacks an irq_data parameter which is nevertheless used by
    xmon_xive_get_irq_config(), leading to an xmon crash.
    
    Fix that by doing a lookup in the system IRQ mapping to query the IRQ
    descriptor data. Invalid interrupt numbers, or not belonging to the
    XIVE IRQ domain, OPAL event interrupt number for instance, should be
    caught by the previous query done at the firmware level.

    V3U creates spurious interrupts which we need to handle. This costs time
    until BUS_PHASE_DATA can be activated which is problematic for Gen2 SoCs
    and earlier. Because of this we introduce two interrupt handlers here
    which will call a generic main irq function once the timing critical
    stuff is done.

    RDMA/rtrs-clt: destroy sysfs after removing session from active list
    
    [ Upstream commit 7f4a8592ff29f19c5a2ca549d0973821319afaad ]
    
    A session can be removed dynamically by sysfs interface "remove_path" that
    eventually calls rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs function.  The current
    rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs first removes the sysfs interfaces and
    frees sess->stats object. Second it removes the session from the active
    list.
    
    Therefore some functions could access non-connected session and access the
    freed sess->stats object even-if they check the session status before
    accessing the session.
    
    For instance rtrs_clt_request and get_next_path_min_inflight check the
    session status and try to send IO to the session.  The session status
    could be changed when they are trying to send IO but they could not catch
    the change and update the statistics information in sess->stats object,
    and generate use-after-free problem.
    (see: "RDMA/rtrs-clt: Check state of the rtrs_clt_sess before reading its
    stats")
    
    This patch changes the rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs to remove the
    session from the active session list and then destroy the sysfs
    interfaces.
    
    Each function still should check the session status because closing or
    error recovery paths can change the status.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Restore host CTRL SPR after guest exit
    
    [ Upstream commit 5088eb4092df12d701af8e0e92860b7186365279 ]
    
    The host CTRL (runlatch) value is not restored after guest exit. The
    host CTRL should always be 1 except in CPU idle code, so this can result
    in the host running with runlatch clear, and potentially switching to
    a different vCPU which then runs with runlatch clear as well.
    
    This has little effect on P9 machines, CTRL is only responsible for some
    PMU counter logic in the host and so other than corner cases of software
    relying on that, or explicitly reading the runlatch value (Linux does
    not appear to be affected but it's possible non-Linux guests could be),
    there should be no execution correctness problem, though it could be
    used as a covert channel between guests.
    
    There may be microcontrollers, firmware or monitoring tools that sample
    the runlatch value out-of-band, however since the register is writable
    by guests, these values would (should) not be relied upon for correct
    operation of the host, so suboptimal performance or incorrect reporting
    should be the worst problem.

    mt7601u: fix always true expression
    
    [ Upstream commit 87fce88658ba047ae62e83497d3f3c5dc22fa6f9 ]
    
    Currently the expression ~nic_conf1 is always true because nic_conf1
    is a u16 and according to 6.5.3.3 of the C standard the ~ operator
    promotes the u16 to an integer before flipping all the bits. Thus
    the top 16 bits of the integer result are all set so the expression
    is always true.  If the intention was to flip all the bits of nic_conf1
    then casting the integer result back to a u16 is a suitabel fix.
    
    Interestingly static analyzers seem to thing a bitwise ! should be
    used instead of ~ for this scenario, so I think the original intent
    of the expression may need some extra consideration.

    A previous commit removed a call to xfs_attr3_leaf_read that
    assigned an error return code to variable error. We now have
    a few early error return paths to label 'out' that return
    error if error is set; however error now is uninitialized
    so potentially garbage is being returned.  Fix this by setting
    error to zero to restore the original behaviour where error
    was zero at the label 'restart'.

    perf vendor events amd: Fix broken L2 Cache Hits from L2 HWPF metric
    
    [ Upstream commit 86c2bc3da769124e3e856b6e9457be3667c30919 ]
    
    Commit 08ed77e414ab2342 ("perf vendor events amd: Add recommended events")
    added the hits event "L2 Cache Hits from L2 HWPF" with the same metric
    expression as the accesses event "L2 Cache Accesses from L2 HWPF":
    
    $ perf list --details
    ...
      l2_cache_accesses_from_l2_hwpf
         [L2 Cache Accesses from L2 HWPF]
         [l2_pf_hit_l2 + l2_pf_miss_l2_hit_l3 + l2_pf_miss_l2_l3]

         [L2 Cache Hits from L2 HWPF]
         [l2_pf_hit_l2 + l2_pf_miss_l2_hit_l3 + l2_pf_miss_l2_l3]
    ...
    
    This was wrong and led to counting hits the same as accesses. Section
    2.1.15.2 "Performance Measurement" of "PPR for AMD Family 17h Model 31h
    B0 - 55803 Rev 0.54 - Sep 12, 2019", documents the hits event with
    EventCode 0x70 which is the same as l2_pf_hit_l2.
    
    Fix this, and massage the description for l2_pf_hit_l2 as the hits event
    is now the duplicate of l2_pf_hit_l2. AMD recommends using the recommended
    event over other events if the duplicate exists and maintain both for
    consistency. Hence, l2_cache_hits_from_l2_hwpf should override
    l2_pf_hit_l2.
    
    Before:
    
     # perf stat -M l2_cache_accesses_from_l2_hwpf,l2_cache_hits_from_l2_hwpf sleep 1
    
     Performance counter stats for 'sleep 1':
    
                 1,436      l2_pf_miss_l2_l3          # 11114.00 l2_cache_accesses_from_l2_hwpf

                 1,477      l2_pf_miss_l2_l3          # 10442.00 l2_cache_accesses_from_l2_hwpf
                 3,978      l2_pf_hit_l2
                 4,987      l2_pf_miss_l2_hit_l3

    Note the difference in performance counter values for the accesses
    versus the hits after the fix, and the hits event now counting the same
    as l2_pf_hit_l2.

    mac80211: bail out if cipher schemes are invalid

    If any of the cipher schemes specified by the driver are invalid, bail
    out and fail the registration rather than just warning.  Otherwise, we

    powerpc: iommu: fix build when neither PCI or IBMVIO is set

    When neither CONFIG_PCI nor CONFIG_IBMVIO is set/enabled, iommu.c has a
    build error. The fault injection code is not useful in that kernel config,
    so make the FAIL_IOMMU option depend on PCI || IBMVIO.

    powerpc/perf: Fix PMU constraint check for EBB events
    
    [ Upstream commit 10f8f96179ecc7f69c927f6d231f6d02736cea83 ]
    
    The power PMU group constraints includes check for EBB events to make
    sure all events in a group must agree on EBB. This will prevent
    scheduling EBB and non-EBB events together. But in the existing check,
    settings for constraint mask and value is interchanged. Patch fixes the
    same.
    
    Before the patch, PMU selftest "cpu_event_pinned_vs_ebb_test" fails with
    below in dmesg logs. This happens because EBB event gets enabled along
    with a non-EBB cpu event.

    powerpc/pseries: Add key to flags in pSeries_lpar_hpte_updateboltedpp()
    
    [ Upstream commit b56d55a5aa4aa9fc166595a7feb57f153ef7b555 ]
    
    The flags argument to plpar_pte_protect() (aka. H_PROTECT), includes
    the key in bits 9-13, but currently we always set those bits to zero.
    
    In the past that hasn't been a problem because we always used key 0
    for the kernel, and updateboltedpp() is only used for kernel mappings.
    
    However since commit d94b827e89dc ("powerpc/book3s64/kuap: Use Key 3
    for kernel mapping with hash translation") we are now inadvertently
    changing the key (to zero) when we call plpar_pte_protect().
    
    That hasn't broken anything because updateboltedpp() is only used for
    STRICT_KERNEL_RWX, which is currently disabled on 64s due to other
    bugs.
    
    But we want to fix that, so first we need to pass the key correctly to
    plpar_pte_protect(). We can't pass our newpp value directly in, we
    have to convert it into the form expected by the hcall.
    
    The hcall we're using here is H_PROTECT, which is specified in section
    14.5.4.1.6 of LoPAPR v1.1.
    
    It takes a `flags` parameter, and the description for flags says:
    
     * flags: AVPN, pp0, pp1, pp2, key0-key4, n, and for the CMO
       option: CMO Option flags as defined in Table 189‚
    
    If you then go to the start of the parent section, 14.5.4.1, on page
    405, it says:
    
    Register Linkage (For hcall() tokens 0x04 - 0x18)
     * On Call
       * R3 function call token
       * R4 flags (see Table 178‚ “Page Frame Table Access flags field
         definition‚” on page 401)
    
    Then you have to go to section 14.5.3, and on page 394 there is a list
    of hcalls and their tokens (table 176), and there you can see that
    H_PROTECT == 0x18.
    
    Finally you can look at table 178, on page 401, where it specifies the
    layout of the bits for the key:
    
     Bit     Function
     -----------------
     50-54 | key0-key4
    
    Those are big-endian bit numbers, converting to normal bit numbers you
    get bits 9-13, or 0x3e00.
    
    In the kernel we have:
    
      #define HPTE_R_KEY_HI         ASM_CONST(0x3000000000000000)
      #define HPTE_R_KEY_LO         ASM_CONST(0x0000000000000e00)
    
    So the LO bits of newpp are already in the right place, and the HI
    bits need to be shifted down by 48.

    powerpc/64s: Fix pte update for kernel memory on radix
    
    [ Upstream commit b8b2f37cf632434456182e9002d63cbc4cccc50c ]
    
    When adding a PTE a ptesync is needed to order the update of the PTE
    with subsequent accesses otherwise a spurious fault may be raised.
    
    radix__set_pte_at() does not do this for performance gains. For
    non-kernel memory this is not an issue as any faults of this kind are
    corrected by the page fault handler. For kernel memory these faults
    are not handled. The current solution is that there is a ptesync in
    flush_cache_vmap() which should be called when mapping from the
    vmalloc region.
    
    However, map_kernel_page() does not call flush_cache_vmap(). This is
    troublesome in particular for code patching with Strict RWX on radix.
    In do_patch_instruction() the page frame that contains the instruction
    to be patched is mapped and then immediately patched. With no ordering
    or synchronization between setting up the PTE and writing to the page
    it is possible for faults.
    
    As the code patching is done using __put_user_asm_goto() the resulting
    fault is obscured - but using a normal store instead it can be seen:
    
      BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access on write at 0xc008000008f24a3c

    IB/hfi1: Use kzalloc() for mmu_rb_handler allocation
    
    [ Upstream commit ca5f72568e034e1295a7ae350b1f786fcbfb2848 ]
    
    The code currently assumes that the mmu_notifier struct
    embedded in mmu_rb_handler only contains two fields.
    
    There are now extra fields:
    
    struct mmu_notifier {
            struct hlist_node hlist;
            const struct mmu_notifier_ops *ops;
            struct mm_struct *mm;
            struct rcu_head rcu;
            unsigned int users;
    };
    
    Given that there in no init for the mmu_notifier, a kzalloc() should
    be used to insure that any newly added fields are given a predictable
    initial value of zero.

    liquidio: Fix unintented sign extension of a left shift of a u16
    
    [ Upstream commit 298b58f00c0f86868ea717426beb5c1198772f81 ]
    
    The macro CN23XX_PEM_BAR1_INDEX_REG is being used to shift oct->pcie_port
    (a u16) left 24 places. There are two subtle issues here, first the
    shift gets promoted to an signed int and then sign extended to a u64.
    If oct->pcie_port is 0x80 or more then the upper bits get sign extended
    to 1. Secondly shfiting a u16 24 bits will lead to an overflow so it
    needs to be cast to a u64 for all the bits to not overflow.
    
    It is entirely possible that the u16 port value is never large enough
    for this to fail, but it is useful to fix unintended overflows such
    as this.
    
    Fix this by casting the port parameter to the macro to a u64 before
    the shift.

    [ Upstream commit 263d6287da1433aba11c5b4046388f2cdf49675c ]
    
    When a VCPU is created, the kvm_vcpu struct is initialized to zero in
    kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu(). On VHE systems, the first time
    vcpu.arch.mdcr_el2 is loaded on hardware is in vcpu_load(), before it is
    set to a sensible value in kvm_arm_setup_debug() later in the run loop. The
    result is that KVM executes for a short time with MDCR_EL2 set to zero.
    
    This has several unintended consequences:
    
    * Setting MDCR_EL2.HPMN to 0 is constrained unpredictable according to ARM
      DDI 0487G.a, page D13-3820. The behavior specified by the architecture
      in this case is for the PE to behave as if MDCR_EL2.HPMN is set to a
      value less than or equal to PMCR_EL0.N, which means that an unknown
      number of counters are now disabled by MDCR_EL2.HPME, which is zero.
    
    * The host configuration for the other debug features controlled by
      MDCR_EL2 is temporarily lost. This has been harmless so far, as Linux
      doesn't use the other fields, but that might change in the future.
    
    Let's avoid both issues by initializing the VCPU's mdcr_el2 field in
    kvm_vcpu_vcpu_first_run_init(), thus making sure that the MDCR_EL2 register
    has a consistent value after each vcpu_load().

    HID: lenovo: Map mic-mute button to KEY_F20 instead of KEY_MICMUTE
    
    [ Upstream commit 617103246cfd19af837e4cb614ba9f877c4f7779 ]
    
    Mapping the mic-mute button to KEY_MICMUTE is technically correct but
    KEY_MICMUTE translates to a scancode of 256 (248 + 8) under X,
    which does not fit in 8 bits, so it does not work.
    
    Because of this userspace is expecting KEY_F20 instead,
    theoretically KEY_MICMUTE should work under Wayland but even
    there it does not work, because the desktop-environment is
    listening only for KEY_F20 and not for KEY_MICMUTE.

    HID: lenovo: Check hid_get_drvdata() returns non NULL in lenovo_event()
    
    [ Upstream commit 34348a8661e3cd67dcf6938f08c8bb77522301f7 ]
    
    The HID lenovo probe function only attaches drvdata to one of the
    USB interfaces, but lenovo_event() will get called for all USB interfaces
    to which hid-lenovo is bound.
    
    This allows a malicious device to fake being a device handled by
    hid-lenovo, which generates events for which lenovo_event() has
    special handling (and thus dereferences hid_get_drvdata()) on another
    interface triggering a NULL pointer exception.
    
    Add a check for hid_get_drvdata() returning NULL, avoiding this
    possible NULL pointer exception.

    HID: lenovo: Fix lenovo_led_set_tp10ubkbd() error handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 658d04e6eb6be1601ae95d7bee92bbf4096cdc1e ]
    
    Fix the following issues with lenovo_led_set_tp10ubkbd() error handling:
    
    1. On success hid_hw_raw_request() returns the number of bytes sent.
       So we should check for (ret != 3) rather then for (ret != 0).
    
    2. Actually propagate errors to the caller.
    
    3. Since the LEDs are part of an USB keyboard-dock the mute LEDs can go
       away at any time. Don't log an error when ret == -ENODEV and set the
       LED_HW_PLUGGABLE flag to avoid errors getting logged when the USB gets
       disconnected.

    iommu/vt-d: Remove WO permissions on second-level paging entries
    
    [ Upstream commit eea53c5816889ee8b64544fa2e9311a81184ff9c ]
    
    When the first level page table is used for IOVA translation, it only
    supports Read-Only and Read-Write permissions. The Write-Only permission
    is not supported as the PRESENT bit (implying Read permission) should
    always set. When using second level, we still give separate permissions
    that allows WriteOnly which seems inconsistent and awkward. We want to
    have consistent behavior. After moving to 1st level, we don't want things
    to work sometimes, and break if we use 2nd level for the same mappings.
    Hence remove this configuration.

    the IOMMU driver could report snoop capability as long as it runs in the
    scalable mode.

    RDMA/core: Fix corrupted SL on passive side
    
    [ Upstream commit 194f64a3cad3ab9e381e996a13089de3215d1887 ]
    
    On RoCE systems, a CM REQ contains a Primary Hop Limit > 1 and Primary
    Subnet Local is zero.
    
    In cm_req_handler(), the cm_process_routed_req() function is called. Since
    the Primary Subnet Local value is zero in the request, and since this is
    RoCE (Primary Local LID is permissive), the following statement will be
    executed:
    
          IBA_SET(CM_REQ_PRIMARY_SL, req_msg, wc->sl);
    
    This corrupts SL in req_msg if it was different from zero. In other words,
    a request to setup a connection using an SL != zero, will not be honored,
    and a connection using SL zero will be created instead.
    
    Fixed by not calling cm_process_routed_req() on RoCE systems, the

    powerpc/pseries: Only register vio drivers if vio bus exists
    
    [ Upstream commit 11d92156f7a862091009d7655d19c1e7de37fc7a ]
    
    The vio bus is a fake bus, which we use on pseries LPARs (guests) to
    discover devices provided by the hypervisor. There's no need or sense
    in creating the vio bus on bare metal systems.
    
    Which is why commit 4336b9337824 ("powerpc/pseries: Make vio and
    ibmebus initcalls pseries specific") made the initialisation of the
    vio bus only happen in LPARs.
    
    However as a result of that commit we now see errors at boot on bare
    metal systems:
    
      Driver 'hvc_console' was unable to register with bus_type 'vio' because the bus was not initialized.
      Driver 'tpm_ibmvtpm' was unable to register with bus_type 'vio' because the bus was not initialized.
    
    This happens because those drivers are built-in, and are calling
    vio_register_driver(). It in turn calls driver_register() with a
    reference to vio_bus_type, but we haven't registered vio_bus_type with
    the driver core.
    
    Fix it by also guarding vio_register_driver() with a check to see if
    we are on pseries.

    [ Upstream commit 78352f73dc5047f3f744764cc45912498c52f3c9 ]
    
    Currently the UDP protocol delivers GSO_FRAGLIST packets to
    the sockets without the expected segmentation.
    
    This change addresses the issue introducing and maintaining
    a couple of new fields to explicitly accept SKB_GSO_UDP_L4

    [ Upstream commit 99067c07e8d877035f6249d194a317c78b7d052d ]
    
    The call sequence in wm8960_configure_clocking is
    
       ret = wm8960_configure_sysclk();
       if (ret >= 0)
            goto configure_clock;
    
       ....
    
       ret = wm8960_configure_pll();
    
    configure_clock:
       ...
    
    wm8960_configure_sysclk is called before wm8960_configure_pll, as
    there is bitclk relax on both functions, so wm8960_configure_sysclk
    always return success, then wm8960_configure_pll() never be called.
    
    With this case:
    aplay -Dhw:0,0 -d 5 -r 48000 -f S24_LE -c 2 audio48k24b2c.wav
    the required bitclk is 48000 * 24 * 2 = 2304000, bitclk got from
    wm8960_configure_sysclk is 3072000, but if go to wm8960_configure_pll.
    it can get correct bitclk 2304000.
    
    So bitclk relax condition should be removed in wm8960_configure_sysclk,
    then wm8960_configure_pll can be called, and there is also bitclk relax
    function in wm8960_configure_pll.

    A System Error (SError, followed by kernel panic) was detected when
    trying to print the supported pins in a pinctrl device which supports
    multiple pins per register. This change fixes the pcs_pin_dbg_show() in
    pinctrl-single driver when bits_per_mux is not zero. In addition move
    offset calculation and pin offset in register to common function.

    [ Upstream commit aa6dd211e4b1dde9d5dc25d699d35f789ae7eeba ]
    
    In commit 73f156a6e8c1 ("inetpeer: get rid of ip_id_count")

    Switch to a dynamic sizing, depending on RAM size.
    
    Typical big hosts will now use 128x more storage (2 MB)
    to get a similar increase in security and reduction
    of hash collisions.
    
    As a bonus, use of alloc_large_system_hash() spreads

    net: lapbether: Prevent racing when checking whether the netif is running
    
    [ Upstream commit 5acd0cfbfbb5a688da1bfb1a2152b0c855115a35 ]
    
    There are two "netif_running" checks in this driver. One is in
    "lapbeth_xmit" and the other is in "lapbeth_rcv". They serve to make
    sure that the LAPB APIs called in these functions are called before
    "lapb_unregister" is called by the "ndo_stop" function.
    
    However, these "netif_running" checks are unreliable, because it's
    possible that immediately after "netif_running" returns true, "ndo_stop"
    is called (which causes "lapb_unregister" to be called).
    
    This patch adds locking to make sure "lapbeth_xmit" and "lapbeth_rcv" can

    Bluetooth: avoid deadlock between hci_dev->lock and socket lock
    
    [ Upstream commit 17486960d79b900c45e0bb8fbcac0262848582ba ]
    
    Commit eab2404ba798 ("Bluetooth: Add BT_PHY socket option") added a
    dependency between socket lock and hci_dev->lock that could lead to
    deadlock.
    
    It turns out that hci_conn_get_phy() is not in any way relying on hdev
    being immutable during the runtime of this function, neither does it even
    look at any of the members of hdev, and as such there is no need to hold
    that lock.
    
    This fixes the lockdep splat below:

    KVM: x86/mmu: Retry page faults that hit an invalid memslot
    
    [ Upstream commit e0c378684b6545ad2d4403bb701d0ac4932b4e95 ]
    
    Retry page faults (re-enter the guest) that hit an invalid memslot
    instead of treating the memslot as not existing, i.e. handling the
    page fault as an MMIO access.  When deleting a memslot, SPTEs aren't
    zapped and the TLBs aren't flushed until after the memslot has been
    marked invalid.
    
    Handling the invalid slot as MMIO means there's a small window where a
    page fault could replace a valid SPTE with an MMIO SPTE.  The legacy
    MMU handles such a scenario cleanly, but the TDP MMU assumes such
    behavior is impossible (see the BUG() in __handle_changed_spte()).
    There's really no good reason why the legacy MMU should allow such a
    scenario, and closing this hole allows for additional cleanups.

    HID: plantronics: Workaround for double volume key presses
    
    [ Upstream commit f567d6ef8606fb427636e824c867229ecb5aefab ]
    
    Plantronics Blackwire 3220 Series (047f:c056) sends HID reports twice
    for each volume key press. This patch adds a quirk to hid-plantronics
    for this product ID, which will ignore the second volume key press if
    it happens within 5 ms from the last one that was handled.
    
    The patch was tested on the mentioned model only, it shouldn't affect
    other models, however, this quirk might be needed for them too.
    Auto-repeat (when a key is held pressed) is not affected, because the
    rate is about 3 times per second, which is far less frequent than once
    in 5 ms.

    xsk: Respect device's headroom and tailroom on generic xmit path
    
    [ Upstream commit 3914d88f7608e6c2e80e344474fa289370c32451 ]
    
    xsk_generic_xmit() allocates a new skb and then queues it for
    xmitting. The size of new skb's headroom is desc->len, so it comes
    to the driver/device with no reserved headroom and/or tailroom.
    Lots of drivers need some headroom (and sometimes tailroom) to
    prepend (and/or append) some headers or data, e.g. CPU tags,
    device-specific headers/descriptors (LSO, TLS etc.), and if case
    of no available space skb_cow_head() will reallocate the skb.
    Reallocations are unwanted on fast-path, especially when it comes
    to XDP, so generic XSK xmit should reserve the spaces declared in
    dev->needed_headroom and dev->needed tailroom to avoid them.
    
    Note on max(NET_SKB_PAD, L1_CACHE_ALIGN(dev->needed_headroom)):
    
    Usually, output functions reserve LL_RESERVED_SPACE(dev), which
    consists of dev->hard_header_len + dev->needed_headroom, aligned
    by 16.
    
    However, on XSK xmit hard header is already here in the chunk, so
    hard_header_len is not needed. But it'd still be better to align
    data up to cacheline, while reserving no less than driver requests
    for headroom. NET_SKB_PAD here is to double-insure there will be
    no reallocations even when the driver advertises no needed_headroom,
    but in fact need it (not so rare case).

    [ Upstream commit 72ce11ddfa4e9e1879103581a60b7e34547eaa0a ]
    
    In null_init, null_add_dev(dev) is called.
    In null_add_dev, it calls null_free_zoned_dev(dev) to free dev->zones
    via kvfree(dev->zones) in out_cleanup_zone branch and returns err.
    Then null_init accept the err code and then calls null_free_dev(dev).
    
    But in null_free_dev(dev), dev->zones is freed again by
    null_free_zoned_dev().
    
    My patch set dev->zones to NULL in null_free_zoned_dev() after
    kvfree(dev->zones) is called, to avoid the double free.

    ataflop: fix off by one in ataflop_probe()

    ataflop: potential out of bounds in do_format()
    
    [ Upstream commit 1ffec389a6431782a8a28805830b6fae9bf00af1 ]
    
    The function uses "type" as an array index:
    
            q = unit[drive].disk[type]->queue;
    
    Unfortunately the bounds check on "type" isn't done until later in the
    function.  Fix this by moving the bounds check to the start.

    kthread: Fix PF_KTHREAD vs to_kthread() race
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a7956e25e1d7b3c148569e78895e1f3178122a9 ]
    
    The kthread_is_per_cpu() construct relies on only being called on
    PF_KTHREAD tasks (per the WARN in to_kthread). This gives rise to the
    following usage pattern:
    
            if ((p->flags & PF_KTHREAD) && kthread_is_per_cpu(p))
    
    However, as reported by syzcaller, this is broken. The scenario is:
    
            CPU0                            CPU1 (running p)
    
            (p->flags & PF_KTHREAD) // true
    
                                            begin_new_exec()
                                              me->flags &= ~(PF_KTHREAD|...);
            kthread_is_per_cpu(p)
              to_kthread(p)
                WARN(!(p->flags & PF_KTHREAD) <-- *SPLAT*
    
    Introduce __to_kthread() that omits the WARN and is sure to check both
    values.
    
    Use this to remove the problematic pattern for kthread_is_per_cpu()
    and fix a number of other kthread_*() functions that have similar
    issues but are currently not used in ways that would expose the
    problem.
    
    Notably kthread_func() is only ever called on 'current', while
    kthread_probe_data() is only used for PF_WQ_WORKER, which implies the
    task is from kthread_create*().

    sched/debug: Fix cgroup_path[] serialization
    
    [ Upstream commit ad789f84c9a145f8a18744c0387cec22ec51651e ]
    
    The handling of sysrq key can be activated by echoing the key to
    /proc/sysrq-trigger or via the magic key sequence typed into a terminal
    that is connected to the system in some way (serial, USB or other mean).
    In the former case, the handling is done in a user context. In the
    latter case, it is likely to be in an interrupt context.
    
    Currently in print_cpu() of kernel/sched/debug.c, sched_debug_lock is
    taken with interrupt disabled for the whole duration of the calls to
    print_*_stats() and print_rq() which could last for the quite some time
    if the information dump happens on the serial console.
    
    If the system has many cpus and the sched_debug_lock is somehow busy
    (e.g. parallel sysrq-t), the system may hit a hard lockup panic
    depending on the actually serial console implementation of the
    system.
    
    The purpose of sched_debug_lock is to serialize the use of the global
    cgroup_path[] buffer in print_cpu(). The rests of the printk calls don't
    need serialization from sched_debug_lock.
    
    Calling printk() with interrupt disabled can still be problematic if
    multiple instances are running. Allocating a stack buffer of PATH_MAX
    bytes is not feasible because of the limited size of the kernel stack.
    
    The solution implemented in this patch is to allow only one caller at a
    time to use the full size group_path[], while other simultaneous callers
    will have to use shorter stack buffers with the possibility of path
    name truncation. A "..." suffix will be printed if truncation may have
    happened.  The cgroup path name is provided for informational purpose
    only, so occasional path name truncation should not be a big problem.

    [ Upstream commit 4917e498c6894ba077867aff78f82cffd5ffbb5c ]
    
    The ARR register is cleared unconditionally upon probing, after the maximum
    value has been read. This initial condition is rather not intuitive, when
    considering the counter child driver. It rather expects the maximum value
    by default:
    - The counter interface shows a zero value by default for 'ceiling'
      attribute.
    - Enabling the counter without any prior configuration makes it doesn't
      count.
    
    The reset value of ARR register is the maximum. So Choice here
    is to backup it, and restore it then, instead of clearing its value.
    It also fixes the initial condition seen by the counter driver.

    [ Upstream commit 15cfef8623a449d40d16541687afd58e78033be3 ]
    
    This fixes an issue hitting the BUG_ON() in ibmvfc_do_work(). When going
    through a host action of IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_RESET, we change the action to
    IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_TGT_DEL, then drop the host lock, and reset the CRQ,
    which changes the host state to IBMVFC_NO_CRQ. If, prior to setting the
    host state to IBMVFC_NO_CRQ, ibmvfc_init_host() is called, it can then end
    up changing the host action to IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_INIT.  If we then change
    the host state to IBMVFC_NO_CRQ, we will then hit the BUG_ON().
    
    Make a couple of changes to avoid this. Leave the host action to be
    IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_RESET or IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_REENABLE until after we drop
    the host lock and reset or reenable the CRQ. Also harden the host state
    machine to ensure we cannot leave the reset / reenable state until we've
    finished processing the reset or reenable.

    scsi: sni_53c710: Add IRQ check
    
    [ Upstream commit 1160d61bc51e87e509cfaf9da50a0060f67b6de4 ]
    
    The driver neglects to check the result of platform_get_irq()'s call and
    blithely passes the negative error codes to request_irq() (which takes
    *unsigned* IRQ #s), causing it to fail with -EINVAL (overridden by -ENODEV
    further below).  Stop calling request_irq() with the invalid IRQ #s.

    The mpi_uninit_check() takes longer for inbound doorbell register to be
    cleared. Increase the timeout substantially so that the driver does not
    fail to load.
    
    Previously, the inbound doorbell wait time was mistakenly increased in the
    mpi_init_check() instead of mpi_uninit_check(). It is okay to leave the
    mpi_init_check() wait time as-is as these are timeout values and if there
    is a failure, waiting longer is not an issue.

    drm/amd/display: check fb of primary plane
    
    [ Upstream commit 7df4ceb60fa9a3c5160cfd5b696657291934a2c9 ]
    
    Sometimes the primary plane might not be initialized (yet), which
    causes dm_check_crtc_cursor to divide by zero.
    Apparently a weird state before a S3-suspend causes the aforementioned
    divide-by-zero error when resuming from S3.  This was explained in
    bug 212293 on Bugzilla.
    
    To avoid this divide-by-zero error we check if the primary plane's fb
    isn't NULL.  If it's NULL the src_w and src_h attributes will be 0,
    which would cause a divide-by-zero.
    
    This fixes Bugzilla report 212293

    clk: zynqmp: pll: add set_pll_mode to check condition in zynqmp_pll_enable
    
    [ Upstream commit 394cdb69a3c30b33524cf1204afe5cceaba69cdc ]
    
    If there is a IOCTL_SET_PLL_FRAC_MODE request sent to ATF ever,
    we shouldn't skip invoking PM_CLOCK_ENABLE fn even though this
    pll has been enabled. In ATF implementation, it will only assign
    the mode to the variable (struct pm_pll *)pll->mode when handling
    IOCTL_SET_PLL_FRAC_MODE call. Invoking PM_CLOCK_ENABLE can force
    ATF send request to PWU to set the pll mode to PLL's register.
    
    There is a scenario that happens in enabling VPLL_INT(clk_id:96):
    1) VPLL_INT has been enabled during booting.
    2) A driver calls clk_set_rate and according to the rate, the VPLL_INT
       should be set to FRAC mode. Then zynqmp_pll_set_mode is called
       to pass IOCTL_SET_PLL_FRAC_MODE to ATF. Note that at this point
       ATF just stores the mode to a variable.
    3) This driver calls clk_prepare_enable and zynqmp_pll_enable is
       called to try to enable VPLL_INT pll. Because of 1), the function
       zynqmp_pll_enable just returns without doing anything after checking
       that this pll has been enabled.
    
    In the scenario above, the pll mode of VPLL_INT will never be set
    successfully. So adding set_pll_mode to check condition to fix it.

    There is a small race where the parent is NULL even though the kobj has
    already been made visible in sysfs.
    
    For instance the attribute_group is made visible in sysfs_create_files()
    and the mdev_type_attr_show() does:
    
        ret = attr->show(kobj, type->parent->dev, buf);
    
    Which will crash on NULL parent. Move the parent setup to before the type
    pointer leaves the stack frame.

    deadlock is avoided by using msm_gem_trylock() and skipping over objects

    vfio/pci: Move VGA and VF initialization to functions
    
    [ Upstream commit 61e90817482871b614133c0f20feb1aba2faec86 ]
    
    vfio_pci_probe() is quite complicated, with optional VF and VGA sub
    components. Move these into clear init/uninit functions and have a linear
    flow in probe/remove.
    
    This fixes a few little buglets:
     - vfio_pci_remove() is in the wrong order, vga_client_register() removes
       a notifier and is after kfree(vdev), but the notifier refers to vdev,
       so it can use after free in a race.
     - vga_client_register() can fail but was ignored
    
    Organize things so destruction order is the reverse of creation order.

    media: v4l2-ctrls.c: fix race condition in hdl->requests list
    
    [ Upstream commit be7e8af98f3af729aa9f08b1053f9533a5cceb91 ]
    
    When a request is re-inited it will release all control handler
    objects that are still in the request. It does that by unbinding
    and putting all those objects. When the object is unbound the
    obj->req pointer is set to NULL, and the object's unbind op is
    called. When the object it put the object's release op is called
    to free the memory.
    
    For a request object that contains a control handler that means
    that v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() is called in the release op.
    
    A control handler used in a request has a pointer to the main
    control handler that is created by the driver and contains the
    current state of all controls. If the device is unbound (due to
    rmmod or a forced unbind), then that main handler is freed, again
    by calling v4l2_ctrl_handler_free(), and any outstanding request
    objects that refer to that main handler have to be unbound and put
    as well.
    
    It does that by this test:
    
            if (!hdl->req_obj.req && !list_empty(&hdl->requests)) {
    
    I.e. the handler has no pointer to a request, so is the main
    handler, and one or more request objects refer to this main
    handler.
    
    However, this test is wrong since hdl->req_obj.req is actually
    NULL when re-initing a request (the object unbind will set req to
    NULL), and the only reason this seemingly worked is that the
    requests list is typically empty since the request's unbind op
    will remove the handler from the requests list.
    
    But if another thread is at the same time adding a new control
    to a request, then there is a race condition where one thread
    is removing a control handler object from the requests list and
    another thread is adding one. The result is that hdl->requests
    is no longer empty and the code thinks that a main handler is
    being freed instead of a control handler that is part of a request.
    
    There are two bugs here: first the test for hdl->req_obj.req: this
    should be hdl->req_obj.ops since only the main control handler will
    have a NULL pointer there.
    
    The second is that adding or deleting request objects from the
    requests list of the main handler isn't protected by taking the
    main handler's lock.

    clk: imx: Fix reparenting of UARTs not associated with stdout
    
    [ Upstream commit 379c9a24cc239000b1dec53db02fe17a86947423 ]
    
    Most if not all i.MX SoC's call a function which enables all UARTS.
    This is a problem for users who need to re-parent the clock source,
    because any attempt to change the parent results in an busy error
    due to the fact that the clocks have been enabled already.
    
      clk: failed to reparent uart1 to sys_pll1_80m: -16
    
    Instead of pre-initializing all UARTS, scan the device tree to see
    which UART clocks are associated to stdout, and only enable those
    UART clocks if it's needed early.  This will move initialization of
    the remaining clocks until after the parenting of the clocks.
    
    When the clocks are shutdown, this mechanism will also disable any
    clocks that were pre-initialized.

    selftests: fix prepending $(OUTPUT) to $(TEST_PROGS)
    
    [ Upstream commit cb4969e6f9f5ee12521aec764fa3d4bbd91bc797 ]
    
    Currently the following command produces an error message:
    
        linux# make kselftest TARGETS=bpf O=/mnt/linux-build
        # selftests: bpf: test_libbpf.sh
        # ./test_libbpf.sh: line 23: ./test_libbpf_open: No such file or directory
        # test_libbpf: failed at file test_l4lb.o
        # selftests: test_libbpf [FAILED]
    
    The error message might not affect the return code of make, therefore
    one needs to grep make output in order to detect it.
    
    This is not the only instance of the same underlying problem; any test
    with more than one element in $(TEST_PROGS) fails the same way. Another
    example:
    
        linux# make O=/mnt/linux-build TARGETS=splice kselftest
        [...]
        # ./short_splice_read.sh: 15: ./splice_read: not found
        # FAIL: /sys/module/test_module/sections/.init.text 2
        not ok 2 selftests: splice: short_splice_read.sh # exit=1
    
    The current logic prepends $(OUTPUT) only to the first member of
    $(TEST_PROGS). After that, run_one() does
    
       cd `dirname $TEST`
    
    For all tests except the first one, `dirname $TEST` is ., which means
    they cannot access the files generated in $(OUTPUT).
    
    Fix by using $(addprefix) to prepend $(OUTPUT)/ to each member of
    $(TEST_PROGS).

    x86/kprobes: Fix to check non boostable prefixes correctly
    
    [ Upstream commit 6dd3b8c9f58816a1354be39559f630cd1bd12159 ]
    
    There are 2 bugs in the can_boost() function because of using
    x86 insn decoder. Since the insn->opcode never has a prefix byte,
    it can not find CS override prefix in it. And the insn->attr is
    the attribute of the opcode, thus inat_is_address_size_prefix(
    insn->attr) always returns false.
    
    Fix those by checking each prefix bytes with for_each_insn_prefix
    loop and getting the correct attribute for each prefix byte.
    Also, this removes unlikely, because this is a slow path.

    In the case where the call to lm3554_platform_data_func returns an
    error there is a memory leak on the error return path of object
    flash.  Fix this by adding an error return path that will free
    flash and rename labels fail2 to fail3 and fail1 to fail2.

    media: aspeed: fix clock handling logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 3536169f8531c2c5b153921dc7d1ac9fd570cda7 ]
    
    Video engine uses eclk and vclk for its clock sources and its reset
    control is coupled with eclk so the current clock enabling sequence works
    like below.
    
     Enable eclk
     De-assert Video Engine reset
     10ms delay
     Enable vclk
    
    It introduces improper reset on the Video Engine hardware and eventually
    the hardware generates unexpected DMA memory transfers that can corrupt
    memory region in random and sporadic patterns. This issue is observed
    very rarely on some specific AST2500 SoCs but it causes a critical
    kernel panic with making a various shape of signature so it's extremely
    hard to debug. Moreover, the issue is observed even when the video
    engine is not actively used because udevd turns on the video engine
    hardware for a short time to make a query in every boot.
    
    To fix this issue, this commit changes the clock handling logic to make
    the reset de-assertion triggered after enabling both eclk and vclk. Also,
    it adds clk_unprepare call for a case when probe fails.
    
    clk: ast2600: fix reset settings for eclk and vclk
    Video engine reset setting should be coupled with eclk to match it
    with the setting for previous Aspeed SoCs which is defined in
    clk-aspeed.c since all Aspeed SoCs are sharing a single video engine
    driver. Also, reset bit 6 is defined as 'Video Engine' reset in
    datasheet so it should be de-asserted when eclk is enabled. This
    commit fixes the setting.

    When setting the source media bus code in the resizer,
    we first check that the current media bus code in the
    source is yuv encoded format. This is done by
    retrieving the data from the formats list of the isp
    entity. This cause a crash when the media bus code on the
    source is YUYV8_1_5X8 which is not supported by the isp
    entity. Instead we should test the sink format of the resizer
    which is guaranteed to be supported by the isp entity.

    The second loop of syslog_print_all() subtracts lengths that were

    records are (over)written during syslog_print_all(). This allows the
    possibility of the second loop subtracting lengths that were never
    added in the first loop.
    
    This situation can result in syslog_print_all() filling the buffer
    starting from a later record, even though there may have been room
    to fit the earlier record(s) as well.

    sched/fair: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in load_balance()
    
    [ Upstream commit 39a2a6eb5c9b66ea7c8055026303b3aa681b49a5 ]
    
    Syzbot reported a handful of occurrences where an sd->nr_balance_failed can
    grow to much higher values than one would expect.
    
    A successful load_balance() resets it to 0; a failed one increments
    it. Once it gets to sd->cache_nice_tries + 3, this *should* trigger an
    active balance, which will either set it to sd->cache_nice_tries+1 or reset
    it to 0. However, in case the to-be-active-balanced task is not allowed to
    run on env->dst_cpu, then the increment is done without any further
    modification.
    
    This could then be repeated ad nauseam, and would explain the absurdly high
    values reported by syzbot (86, 149). VincentG noted there is value in
    letting sd->cache_nice_tries grow, so the shift itself should be
    fixed. That means preventing:
    
      """
      If the value of the right operand is negative or is greater than or equal
      to the width of the promoted left operand, the behavior is undefined.
      """
    
    Thus we need to cap the shift exponent to
      BITS_PER_TYPE(typeof(lefthand)) - 1.
    
    I had a look around for other similar cases via coccinelle:
    
      @expr@
      position pos;
      expression E1;
      expression E2;

    The only other match in kernel/sched is rq_clock_thermal() which employs
    sched_thermal_decay_shift, and that exponent is already capped to 10, so
    that one is fine.

    scsi: lpfc: Fix null pointer dereference in lpfc_prep_els_iocb()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8dd1c125f7f838abad009b64bff5f0a11afe3cb6 ]
    
    It is possible to call lpfc_issue_els_plogi() passing a did for which no
    matching ndlp is found. A call is then made to lpfc_prep_els_iocb() with a
    null pointer to a lpfc_nodelist structure resulting in a null pointer
    dereference.
    
    Fix by returning an error status if no valid ndlp is found. Fix up comments
    regarding ndlp reference counting.

    drm/mcde/panel: Inverse misunderstood flag
    
    [ Upstream commit d0c5ac04e7feedbc069f26f4dcbf35b521ae7fc5 ]
    
    A recent patch renaming MIPI_DSI_MODE_EOT_PACKET to
    MIPI_DSI_MODE_NO_EOT_PACKET brought to light the
    misunderstanding in the current MCDE driver and all
    its associated panel drivers that MIPI_DSI_MODE_EOT_PACKET
    would mean "use EOT packet" when in fact it means the
    reverse.
    
    Fix it up by implementing the flag right in the MCDE
    DSI driver and remove the flag from panels that actually
    want the EOT packet.

    drm/amd/display: Fix off by one in hdmi_14_process_transaction()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8e6fafd5a22e7a2eb216f5510db7aab54cc545c1 ]
    
    The hdcp_i2c_offsets[] array did not have an entry for
    HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_WRITE_CONTENT_STREAM_TYPE so it led to an off by one
    read overflow.  I added an entry and copied the 0x0 value for the offset
    from similar code in drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/modules/hdcp/hdcp_ddc.c.
    
    I also declared several of these arrays as having HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_MAX
    entries.  This doesn't change the code, but it's just a belt and
    suspenders approach to try future proof the code.

    drm/stm: Fix bus_flags handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 99e360442f223dd40fc23ae07c7a263836fd27e6 ]
    
    The drm_display_mode_to_videomode() does not populate DISPLAY_FLAGS_DE_LOW
    or DISPLAY_FLAGS_PIXDATA_NEGEDGE flags in struct videomode. Therefore, no
    matter what polarity the next bridge or display might require, these flags
    are never set, and thus the LTDC GCR_DEPOL and GCR_PCPOL bits are never set
    and the LTDC behaves as if both DISPLAY_FLAGS_PIXDATA_POSEDGE and
    DISPLAY_FLAGS_DE_HIGH were always set.
    
    The fix for this problem is taken almost verbatim from MXSFB driver. In
    case there is a bridge attached to the LTDC, the bridge might have extra
    polarity requirements, so extract bus_flags from the bridge and use them
    for LTDC configuration. Otherwise, extract bus_flags from the connector,
    which is the display.

    soc: aspeed: fix a ternary sign expansion bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ffa828534036348fa90fb3079ccc0972d202c4a ]
    
    The intent here was to return negative error codes but it actually
    returns positive values.  The problem is that type promotion with
    ternary operations is quite complicated.
    
    "ret" is an int.  "copied" is a u32.  And the snoop_file_read() function
    returns long.  What happens is that "ret" is cast to u32 and becomes
    positive then it's cast to long and it's still positive.
    
    Fix this by removing the ternary so that "ret" is type promoted directly
    to long.

    xen-blkback: fix compatibility bug with single page rings
    
    [ Upstream commit d75e7f63b7c95c527cde42efb5d410d7f961498f ]
    
    Prior to commit 4a8c31a1c6f5 ("xen/blkback: rework connect_ring() to avoid
    inconsistent xenstore 'ring-page-order' set by malicious blkfront"), the
    behaviour of xen-blkback when connecting to a frontend was:
    
    - read 'ring-page-order'
    - if not present then expect a single page ring specified by 'ring-ref'
    - else expect a ring specified by 'ring-refX' where X is between 0 and
      1 << ring-page-order
    
    This was correct behaviour, but was broken by the afforementioned commit to
    become:
    
    - read 'ring-page-order'
    - if not present then expect a single page ring (i.e. ring-page-order = 0)
    - expect a ring specified by 'ring-refX' where X is between 0 and
      1 << ring-page-order
    - if that didn't work then see if there's a single page ring specified by
      'ring-ref'
    
    This incorrect behaviour works most of the time but fails when a frontend
    that sets 'ring-page-order' is unloaded and replaced by one that does not
    because, instead of reading 'ring-ref', xen-blkback will read the stale
    'ring-ref0' left around by the previous frontend will try to map the wrong
    grant reference.
    
    This patch restores the original behaviour.

    [ Upstream commit e2a5e8448e7393e96ccde346c68764b40a52cc10 ]
    
    Data received during half-duplex transmission must be filtered.
    If the target device responds quickly, emptying the FIFO at the end of
    the transmission can erase not only the echo characters but also part of
    the response message.
    By keeping the receive interrupt enabled even during transmission, it
    allows you to filter each echo character and only in a number equal to
    those transmitted.
    The issue was generated by a target device that started responding
    240us later having received a request in communication at 115200bps.
    Sometimes, some messages received by the target were missing some of the
    first bytes.

    When core is in hibernation in host mode and a device cable
    was connected then driver exited from device hibernation.
    However, registers saved for host mode and when exited from
    device hibernation register restore would be done for device
    register which was wrong because there was no device registers
    stored to restore.
    
    - Added dwc_handle_gpwrdn_disc_det() function which handles
      gpwrdn disconnect detect flow and exits hibernation
      without restoring the registers.
    - Updated exiting from hibernation in GPWRDN_STS_CHGINT with
      calling dwc_handle_gpwrdn_disc_det() function. Here no register
      is restored which is the solution described above.

    PM: hibernate: x86: Use crc32 instead of md5 for hibernation e820 integrity check
    
    [ Upstream commit f5d1499ae2096d7ea301023c4cc54e427300eb0a ]
    
    Hibernation fails on a system in fips mode because md5 is used for the e820
    integrity check and is not available. Use crc32 instead.
    
    The check is intended to detect whether the E820 memory map provided
    by the firmware after cold boot unexpectedly differs from the one that
    was in use when the hibernation image was created. In this case, the
    hibernation image cannot be restored, as it may cover memory regions
    that are no longer available to the OS.
    
    A non-cryptographic checksum such as CRC-32 is sufficient to detect such
    inadvertent deviations.

    Drivers: hv: vmbus: Increase wait time for VMbus unload
    
    [ Upstream commit 77db0ec8b7764cb9b09b78066ebfd47b2c0c1909 ]
    
    When running in Azure, disks may be connected to a Linux VM with
    read/write caching enabled. If a VM panics and issues a VMbus
    UNLOAD request to Hyper-V, the response is delayed until all dirty
    data in the disk cache is flushed.  In extreme cases, this flushing
    can take 10's of seconds, depending on the disk speed and the amount
    of dirty data. If kdump is configured for the VM, the current 10 second
    timeout in vmbus_wait_for_unload() may be exceeded, and the UNLOAD
    complete message may arrive well after the kdump kernel is already
    running, causing problems.  Note that no problem occurs if kdump is
    not enabled because Hyper-V waits for the cache flush before doing
    a reboot through the BIOS/UEFI code.
    
    Fix this problem by increasing the timeout in vmbus_wait_for_unload()
    to 100 seconds. Also output periodic messages so that if anyone is
    watching the serial console, they won't think the VM is completely
    hung.

    x86/platform/uv: Fix !KEXEC build failure
    
    [ Upstream commit c2209ea55612efac75de0a58ef5f7394fae7fa0f ]
    
    When KEXEC is disabled, the UV build fails:
    
      arch/x86/platform/uv/uv_nmi.c:875:14: error: ‘uv_nmi_kexec_failed’ undeclared (first use in this function)
    
    Since uv_nmi_kexec_failed is only defined in the KEXEC_CORE #ifdef branch,
    this code cannot ever have been build tested:
    
            if (main)
                    pr_err("UV: NMI kdump: KEXEC not supported in this kernel\n");
            atomic_set(&uv_nmi_kexec_failed, 1);
    
    Nor is this use possible in uv_handle_nmi():
    
                    atomic_set(&uv_nmi_kexec_failed, 0);
    
    These bugs were introduced in this commit:
    
        d0a9964e9873: ("x86/platform/uv: Implement simple dump failover if kdump fails")
    
    Which added the uv_nmi_kexec_failed assignments to !KEXEC code, while making the
    definition KEXEC-only - apparently without testing the !KEXEC case.
    
    Instead of complicating the #ifdef maze, simplify the code by requiring X86_UV
    to depend on KEXEC_CORE. This pattern is present in other architectures as well.
    
    ( We'll remove the untested, 7 years old !KEXEC complications from the file in a
      separate commit. )

    spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: return -ENOMEM if dma_map_single fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 126bdb606fd2802454e6048caef1be3e25dd121e ]
    
    The spi controller supports 44-bit address space on AXI in DMA mode,
    so set dma_addr_t width to 44-bit to avoid using a swiotlb mapping.
    In addition, if dma_map_single fails, it should return immediately
    instead of continuing doing the DMA operation which bases on invalid

    spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: fix hang issue when suspend/resume
    
    [ Upstream commit 799f923f0a66a9c99f0a3eaa078b306db7a8b33a ]
    
    After calling platform_set_drvdata(pdev, xqspi) in probe, the return
    value of dev_get_drvdata(dev) is a pointer to struct zynqmp_qspi but
    not struct spi_controller. A wrong structure type passing to the
    functions spi_controller_suspend/resume will hang the system.
    
    And we should check the return value of spi_controller_suspend, if
    an error is returned, return it to PM subsystem to stop suspend.
    
    Also, GQSPI_EN_MASK should be written to GQSPI_EN_OFST to enable
    the spi controller in zynqmp_qspi_resume since it was disabled in
    zynqmp_qspi_suspend before.

    spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: fix clk_enable/disable imbalance issue
    
    [ Upstream commit c6bdae08012b2ca3e94f3a41ef4ca8cfe7c9ab6f ]
    
    The clks "pclk" and "ref_clk" are enabled twice during the probe. The
    first time is in the function zynqmp_qspi_probe and the second time is
    in zynqmp_qspi_setup_op which is called by devm_spi_register_controller.
    Then calling zynqmp_qspi_remove (rmmod this module) to disable these clks
    will trigger a warning as below:
    
    [  309.124604] Unpreparing enabled qspi_ref
    [  309.128641] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 537 at drivers/clk/clk.c:824 clk_core_unprepare+0x108/0x110
    
    Since pm_runtime works now, clks can be enabled/disabled by calling
    zynqmp_runtime_suspend/resume. So we don't need to enable these clks
    explicitly in zynqmp_qspi_setup_op. Remove them to fix this issue.
    
    And remove clk enabling/disabling in zynqmp_qspi_resume because there is
    no spi transfer operation so enabling ref_clk is redundant meanwhile pclk
    is not disabled for it is shared with other peripherals.
    
    Furthermore replace clk_enable/disable with clk_prepare_enable and
    clk_disable_unprepare in runtime_suspend/resume functions.

    security: keys: trusted: fix TPM2 authorizations
    
    [ Upstream commit de66514d934d70ce73c302ce0644b54970fc7196 ]
    
    In TPM 1.2 an authorization was a 20 byte number.  The spec actually
    recommended you to hash variable length passwords and use the sha1
    hash as the authorization.  Because the spec doesn't require this
    hashing, the current authorization for trusted keys is a 40 digit hex
    number.  For TPM 2.0 the spec allows the passing in of variable length
    passwords and passphrases directly, so we should allow that in trusted
    keys for ease of use.  Update the 'blobauth' parameter to take this
    into account, so we can now use plain text passwords for the keys.
    
    so before
    
    keyctl add trusted kmk "new 32 blobauth=f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258fkeyhandle=81000001" @u
    
    after we will accept both the old hex sha1 form as well as a new
    directly supplied password:
    
    keyctl add trusted kmk "new 32 blobauth=hello keyhandle=81000001" @u
    
    Since a sha1 hex code must be exactly 40 bytes long and a direct
    password must be 20 or less, we use the length as the discriminator
    for which form is input.
    
    Note this is both and enhancement and a potential bug fix.  The TPM
    2.0 spec requires us to strip leading zeros, meaning empyty
    authorization is a zero length HMAC whereas we're currently passing in
    20 bytes of zeros.  A lot of TPMs simply accept this as OK, but the
    Microsoft TPM emulator rejects it with TPM_RC_BAD_AUTH, so this patch
    makes the Microsoft TPM emulator work with trusted keys.

    [ Upstream commit f829b4b212a315b912cb23fd10aaf30534bb5ce9 ]
    
    When the superuser flushes the entire cache, the mmap_read_lock() is not
    taken, but mmap_read_unlock() is called.  Add the missing
    mmap_read_lock() call.

    USB: cdc-acm: fix TIOCGSERIAL implementation
    
    [ Upstream commit 496960274153bdeb9d1f904ff1ea875cef8232c1 ]
    
    TIOCSSERIAL is a horrid, underspecified, legacy interface which for most
    serial devices is only useful for setting the close_delay and
    closing_wait parameters.
    
    The xmit_fifo_size parameter could be used to set the hardware transmit
    fifo size of a legacy UART when it could not be detected, but the
    interface is limited to eight bits and should be left unset when it is
    not used.
    
    Similarly, baud_base could be used to set the UART base clock when it
    could not be detected, but might as well be left unset when it is not
    known (which is the case for CDC).
    
    Fix the cdc-acm TIOCGSERIAL implementation by dropping its custom
    interpretation of the unused xmit_fifo_size and baud_base fields, which
    overflowed the former with the URB buffer size and set the latter to the
    current line speed. Also return the port line number, which is the only
    other value used besides the close parameters.
    
    Note that the current line speed can still be retrieved through the
    standard termios interfaces.

    When starting a read operation, we should call zynqmp_qspi_setuprxdma

    zynqmp_qspi_fillgenfifo, generate the appropriate command with
    operating mode and bytes to transfer, and fill the GENFIFO with
    the command to perform the read operation.
    
    Calling zynqmp_qspi_fillgenfifo before zynqmp_qspi_setuprxdma will
    result in incorrect transfer length and operating mode. So change
    the calling order to fix this issue.

    [ Upstream commit 8ad07d79bd56a531990a1a3f3f1c0eb19d2de806 ]
    
    There is a data corruption issue that occurs in the reading operation
    (cmd:0x6c) when transmitting common data as dummy circles.
    
    The gqspi controller has the functionality to send dummy clock circles.
    When writing data with the fields [receive, transmit, data_xfer] = [0,0,1]
    to the Generic FIFO, and configuring the correct SPI mode, the controller
    will transmit dummy circles.
    
    So let's switch to hardware dummy cycles transfer to fix this issue.

    clk: mvebu: armada-37xx-periph: Fix workaround for switching from L1 to L0
    
    [ Upstream commit e93033aff684641f71a436ca7a9d2a742126baaf ]
    
    When CPU frequency is at 250 MHz and set_rate() is called with 500 MHz (L1)
    quickly followed by a call with 1 GHz (L0), the CPU does not necessarily
    stay in L1 for at least 20ms as is required by Marvell errata.
    
    This situation happens frequently with the ondemand cpufreq governor and
    can be also reproduced with userspace governor. In most cases it causes CPU
    to crash.
    
    This change fixes the above issue and ensures that the CPU always stays in
    L1 for at least 20ms when switching from any state to L0.

    cpufreq: armada-37xx: Fix the AVS value for load L1
    
    [ Upstream commit d118ac2062b5b8331c8768ac81e016617e0996ee ]
    
    The original CPU voltage value for load L1 is too low for Armada 37xx SoC
    when base CPU frequency is 1000 or 1200 MHz. It leads to instabilities
    where CPU gets stuck soon after dynamic voltage scaling from load L1 to L0.
    
    Update the CPU voltage value for load L1 accordingly when base frequency is
    1000 or 1200 MHz. The minimal L1 value for base CPU frequency 1000 MHz is
    updated from the original 1.05V to 1.108V and for 1200 MHz is updated to
    1.155V. This minimal L1 value is used only in the case when it is lower
    than value for L0.
    
    This change fixes CPU instability issues on 1 GHz and 1.2 GHz variants of
    Espressobin and 1 GHz Turris Mox.
    
    Marvell previously for 1 GHz variant of Espressobin provided a patch [1]
    suitable only for their Marvell Linux kernel 4.4 fork which workarounded
    this issue. Patch forced CPU voltage value to 1.108V in all loads. But
    such change does not fix CPU instability issues on 1.2 GHz variants of
    Armada 3720 SoC.
    
    During testing we come to the conclusion that using 1.108V as minimal
    value for L1 load makes 1 GHz variants of Espressobin and Turris Mox boards
    stable. And similarly 1.155V for 1.2 GHz variant of Espressobin.
    
    These two values 1.108V and 1.155V are documented in Armada 3700 Hardware
    Specifications as typical initial CPU voltage values.
    
    Discussion about this issue is also at the Armbian forum [2].

    cpufreq: armada-37xx: Fix setting TBG parent for load levels
    
    [ Upstream commit 22592df194e31baf371906cc720da38fa0ab68f5 ]
    
    With CPU frequency determining software [1] we have discovered that
    after this driver does one CPU frequency change, the base frequency of
    the CPU is set to the frequency of TBG-A-P clock, instead of the TBG
    that is parent to the CPU.
    
    This can be reproduced on EspressoBIN and Turris MOX:
      cd /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0
      echo powersave >scaling_governor
      echo performance >scaling_governor
    
    Running the mhz tool before this driver is loaded reports 1000 MHz, and
    after loading the driver and executing commands above the tool reports
    800 MHz.
    
    The change of TBG clock selector is supposed to happen in function
    armada37xx_cpufreq_dvfs_setup. Before the function returns, it does
    this:
      parent = clk_get_parent(clk);
      clk_set_parent(clk, parent);
    
    The armada-37xx-periph clock driver has the .set_parent method
    implemented correctly for this, so if the method was actually called,
    this would work. But since the introduction of the common clock
    framework in commit b2476490ef11 ("clk: introduce the common clock..."),
    the clk_set_parent function checks whether the parent is actually
    changing, and if the requested new parent is same as the old parent
    (which is obviously the case for the code above), the .set_parent method
    is not called at all.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by filling the correct TBG clock selector
    directly in the armada37xx_cpufreq_dvfs_setup during the filling of
    other registers at the same address. But the determination of CPU TBG
    index cannot be done via the common clock framework, therefore we need
    to access the North Bridge Peripheral Clock registers directly in this
    driver.

    All of the CPPC sysfs show functions are called via indirect call in

    ssize_t (*show)(struct kobject *kobj, struct kobj_attribute *attr, char *buf);
    
    because that is the type of the ->show() member in
    'struct kobj_attribute' but they are actually of type
    
    ssize_t (*show)(struct kobject *kobj, struct attribute *attr, char *buf);
    
    because of the ->show() member in 'struct cppc_attr', resulting in a
    Control Flow Integrity violation [1].
    
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/acpi_cppc/highest_perf
    3400
    
    $ dmesg | grep "CFI failure"
    [  175.970559] CFI failure (target: show_highest_perf+0x0/0x8):
    
    As far as I can tell, the only difference between 'struct cppc_attr'
    and 'struct kobj_attribute' aside from the type of the attr parameter
    is the type of the count parameter in the ->store() member (ssize_t vs.
    size_t), which does not actually matter because all of these nodes are
    read-only.
    
    Eliminate 'struct cppc_attr' in favor of 'struct kobj_attribute' to fix
    the violation.

    hash verification failure, without any indication of what went wrong.
    
    Improve this by validating that the firmware loader did return the
    amount of data requested.

    [ Upstream commit 794aaf01444d4e765e2b067cba01cc69c1c68ed9 ]
    
    We can't rely on the contents of the devres list during
    spi_unregister_controller(), as the list is already torn down at the
    time we perform devres_find() for devm_spi_release_controller. This
    causes devices registered with devm_spi_alloc_{master,slave}() to be
    mistakenly identified as legacy, non-devm managed devices and have their
    reference counters decremented below 0.

    [ Upstream commit ac4daf737674b4d29e19b7c300caff3bcf7160d8 ]
    
    To avoid spurious timer interrupts when KTIME_MAX is used, we need to
    configure set_state_oneshot_stopped(). Although implementing this is
    optional, it still affects things like power management for the extra
    timer interrupt.

    Introduce CLOCK_EVT_STATE_ONESHOT_STOPPED state") and commit cf8c5009ee37

    clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Fix posted mode status check order
    
    [ Upstream commit 212709926c5493a566ca4086ad4f4b0d4e66b553 ]
    
    When the timer is configured in posted mode, we need to check the write-
    posted status register (TWPS) before writing to the register.
    
    We now check TWPS after the write starting with commit 52762fbd1c47
    ("clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Add clockevent and clocksource
    support").
    
    For example, in the TRM for am571x the following is documented in chapter
    "22.2.4.13.1.1 Write Posting Synchronization Mode":
    
    "For each register, a status bit is provided in the timer write-posted
     status (TWPS) register. In this mode, it is mandatory that software check
     this status bit before any write access. If a write is attempted to a
     register with a previous access pending, the previous access is discarded
     without notice."
    
    The regression happened when I updated the code to use standard read/write
    accessors for the driver instead of using __omap_dm_timer_load_start().
    We have__omap_dm_timer_load_start() check the TWPS status correctly using
    __omap_dm_timer_write().

    1. Always check that the type of the return ACPI object is package, rather
       then only checking this for instance_id == 0
    2. Check that the package has the minimum amount of elements which will
       be consumed by the populate_foo_data() for the attr_type
    
    Note/TODO: The populate_foo_data() functions should also be made more
    robust. The should check the type of each of the elements matches the
    type which they expect and in case of populate_enum_data()
    obj->package.count should be passed to it as an argument and it should
    re-check this itself since it consume a variable number of elements.

    [ Upstream commit 5e84a66f3682af4f177bb24bb2ad5135c51f764a ]
    
    TIOCSSERIAL is a horrid, underspecified, legacy interface which for most
    serial devices is only useful for setting the close_delay and
    closing_wait parameters.
    
    The xmit_fifo_size parameter could be used to set the hardware transmit
    fifo size of a legacy UART when it could not be detected, but the
    interface is limited to eight bits and should be left unset when not
    used.
    
    Fix the fwserial implementation by dropping its custom interpretation of
    the unused xmit_fifo_size field, which was overflowed with the driver
    FIFO size. Also leave the type and flags fields unset as these cannot be
    changed.
    
    The close_delay and closing_wait parameters returned by TIOCGSERIAL are
    specified in centiseconds. The driver does not yet support changing
    closing_wait, but let's report back the default value actually used (30
    seconds).

    If the callee gpmi_alloc_dma_buffer() failed to alloc memory for
    this->raw_buffer, gpmi_free_dma_buffer() will be called to free
    this->auxiliary_virt. But this->auxiliary_virt is still a non-NULL
    and valid ptr.
    
    Then gpmi_alloc_dma_buffer() returns err and gpmi_free_dma_buffer()
    is called again to free this->auxiliary_virt in err_out. This causes
    a double free.
    
    As gpmi_free_dma_buffer() has already called in gpmi_alloc_dma_buffer's
    error path, so it should return err directly instead of releasing the dma
    buffer again.

    iio: adc: Kconfig: make AD9467 depend on ADI_AXI_ADC symbol
    
    [ Upstream commit 194eafc9c1d49b53b59de9821fb63d423344cae3 ]
    
    Because a dependency on HAS_IOMEM and OF was added for the ADI AXI ADC
    driver, this makes the AD9467 driver have some build/dependency issues
    when OF is disabled (typically on ACPI archs like x86).
    
    This is because the selection of the AD9467 enforces the ADI_AXI_ADC symbol
    which is blocked by the OF (and potentially HAS_IOMEM) being disabled.
    
    To fix this, we make the AD9467 driver depend on the ADI_AXI_ADC symbol.
    The AD9467 driver cannot operate on it's own. It requires the ADI AXI ADC
    driver to stream data (or some similar IIO interface).
    
    So, the fix here is to make the AD9467 symbol depend on the ADI_AXI_ADC
    symbol. At some point this could become it's own subgroup of high-speed
    ADCs.

    firmware: qcom_scm: Workaround lack of "is available" call on SC7180
    
    [ Upstream commit 257f2935cbbf14b16912c635fcd8ff43345c953b ]
    
    Some SC7180 firmwares don't implement the QCOM_SCM_INFO_IS_CALL_AVAIL
    API, so we can't probe the calling convention. We detect the legacy
    calling convention on these firmwares, because the availability call
    always fails and legacy is the fallback. This leads to problems where
    the rmtfs driver fails to probe, because it tries to assign memory with
    a bad calling convention, which then leads to modem failing to load and
    all networking, even wifi, to fail. Ouch!
    
    Let's force the calling convention to be what it always is on this SoC,
    i.e. arm64. Of course, the calling convention is not the same thing as
    implementing the QCOM_SCM_INFO_IS_CALL_AVAIL API. The absence of the "is
    this call available" API from the firmware means that any call to
    __qcom_scm_is_call_available() fails. This is OK for now though because
    none of the calls that are checked for existence are implemented on
    firmware running on sc7180. If such a call needs to be checked for
    existence in the future, we presume that firmware will implement this
    API and then things will "just work".

    firmware: qcom_scm: Reduce locking section for __get_convention()
    
    [ Upstream commit f6ea568f0ddcdfad52807110ed8983e610f0e03b ]
    
    We shouldn't need to hold this spinlock here around the entire SCM call
    into the firmware and back. Instead, we should be able to query the
    firmware, potentially in parallel with other CPUs making the same
    convention detection firmware call, and then grab the lock to update the
    calling convention detected. The convention doesn't change at runtime so
    calling into firmware more than once is possibly wasteful but simpler.
    Besides, this is the slow path, not the fast path where we've already
    detected the convention used.
    
    More importantly, this allows us to add more logic here to workaround
    the case where the firmware call to check for availability isn't
    implemented in the firmware at all. In that case we can check the
    firmware node compatible string and force a calling convention.
    
    Note that we remove the 'has_queried' logic that is repeated twice. That
    could lead to the calling convention being printed multiple times to the
    kernel logs if the bool is true but __query_convention() is running on
    multiple CPUs. We also shorten the time where the lock is held, but we
    keep the lock held around the printk because it doesn't seem hugely
    important to drop it for that.

    Make __qcom_scm_is_call_available() return bool instead of int. The
    function has "is" in the name, so it should return a bool to indicate
    the truth of the call being available. Unfortunately, it can return a
    number < 0 which also looks "true", but not all callers expect that and
    thus they think a call is available when really the check to see if the
    call is available failed to figure it out.

    The function adf_isr_resource_alloc() is not unwinding correctly in case
    of error.
    This patch fixes the error paths and propagate the errors to the caller.

    crypto: poly1305 - fix poly1305_core_setkey() declaration
    
    [ Upstream commit 8d195e7a8ada68928f2aedb2c18302a4518fe68e ]
    
    gcc-11 points out a mismatch between the declaration and the definition
    of poly1305_core_setkey():
    
    lib/crypto/poly1305-donna32.c:13:67: error: argument 2 of type ‘const u8[16]’ {aka ‘const unsigned char[16]’} with mismatched bound [-Werror=array-parameter=]
       13 | void poly1305_core_setkey(struct poly1305_core_key *key, const u8 raw_key[16])
          |                                                          ~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~
    In file included from lib/crypto/poly1305-donna32.c:11:
    include/crypto/internal/poly1305.h:21:68: note: previously declared as ‘const u8 *’ {aka ‘const unsigned char *’}
       21 | void poly1305_core_setkey(struct poly1305_core_key *key, const u8 *raw_key);
    
    This is harmless in principle, as the calling conventions are the same,
    but the more specific prototype allows better type checking in the
    caller.
    
    Change the declaration to match the actual function definition.
    The poly1305_simd_init() is a bit suspicious here, as it previously
    had a 32-byte argument type, but looks like it needs to take the
    16-byte POLY1305_BLOCK_SIZE array instead.

    Currently it leaves unhandled interrupts unmasked, but those are never
    acked. In the case of a "device idle" interrupt, this leads to an
    effectively frozen system until plugging it in.

    [ Upstream commit 00aa6e65aa04e500a11a2c91e92a11c37b9e234d ]
    
    Multiple threads or clients can submit a command to the TEE ring
    buffer. This patch helps to synchronize command submission to the
    ring.
    
    One thread shall write a command to a TEE ring buffer entry only if:
    
     - Trusted OS has notified that the TEE command for the given entry
       has been processed and driver has copied the TEE response into
       client buffer.
    
     - The command entry is empty and can be written into.
    
    After a command has been written to the TEE ring buffer, the global
    wptr (mutex protected) shall be incremented for use by next client.
    
    If PSP became unresponsive while processing TEE request from a
    client, then further command submission to queue will be disabled.

    devtmpfs: fix placement of complete() call
    
    [ Upstream commit 38f087de8947700d3b06d3d1594490e0f611c5d1 ]
    
    Calling complete() from within the __init function is wrong -
    theoretically, the init process could proceed all the way to freeing
    the init mem before the devtmpfsd thread gets to execute the return
    instruction in devtmpfs_setup().
    
    In practice, it seems to be harmless as gcc inlines devtmpfs_setup()
    into devtmpfsd(). So the calls of the __init functions init_chdir()
    etc. actually happen from devtmpfs_setup(), but the __ref on that one
    silences modpost (it's all right, because those calls happen before
    the complete()). But it does make the __init annotation of the setup
    function moot, which we'll fix in a subsequent patch.

    x86/microcode: Check for offline CPUs before requesting new microcode
    
    [ Upstream commit 7189b3c11903667808029ec9766a6e96de5012a5 ]
    
    Currently, the late microcode loading mechanism checks whether any CPUs
    are offlined, and, in such a case, aborts the load attempt.
    
    However, this must be done before the kernel caches new microcode from
    the filesystem. Otherwise, when offlined CPUs are onlined later, those
    cores are going to be updated through the CPU hotplug notifier callback
    with the new microcode, while CPUs previously onine will continue to run
    with the older microcode.
    
    For example:
    
    Turn off one core (2 threads):
    
      echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/online
      echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
    
    Install the ucode fails because a primary SMT thread is offline:
    
      cp intel-ucode/06-8e-09 /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/
      echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/microcode/reload
      bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
    
    Turn the core back on
    
      echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/online
      echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
      cat /proc/cpuinfo |grep microcode
      microcode : 0x30
      microcode : 0xde
      microcode : 0x30
      microcode : 0xde
    
    The rationale for why the update is aborted when at least one primary
    thread is offline is because even if that thread is soft-offlined
    and idle, it will still have to participate in broadcasted MCE's
    synchronization dance or enter SMM, and in both examples it will execute
    instructions so it better have the same microcode revision as the other
    cores.

    spi: stm32: Fix use-after-free on unbind
    
    [ Upstream commit 79c6246ae8793448c05da86a4c82298eed8549b0 ]
    
    stm32_spi_remove() accesses the driver's private data after calling
    spi_unregister_master() even though that function releases the last
    reference on the spi_master and thereby frees the private data.
    
    Fix by switching over to the new devm_spi_alloc_master() helper which
    keeps the private data accessible until the driver has unbound.

    spi: stm32: drop devres version of spi_register_master
    
    [ Upstream commit 8d559a64f00b59af9cc02b803ff52f6e6880a651 ]
    
    A call to spi_unregister_master() triggers calling remove()
    for all the spi devices binded to the spi master.
    
    Some spi device driver requires to "talk" with the spi device
    during the remove(), e.g.:
    - a LCD panel like drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-lg-lg4573.c
      will turn off the backlighting sending a command over spi.
    This implies that the spi master must be fully functional when
    spi_unregister_master() is called, either if it is called
    explicitly in the master's remove() code or implicitly by the
    devres framework.
    
    Devres calls devres_release_all() to release all the resources
    "after" the remove() of the spi master driver (check code of
    __device_release_driver() in drivers/base/dd.c).
    If the spi master driver has an empty remove() then there would
    be no issue; the devres_release_all() will release everything
    in reverse order w.r.t. probe().
    But if code in spi master driver remove() disables the spi or
    makes it not functional (like in this spi-stm32), then devres
    cannot be used safely for unregistering the spi master and the
    binded spi devices.
    
    Replace devm_spi_register_master() with spi_register_master()
    and add spi_unregister_master() as first action in remove().

    arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Avoid glitching SPI CS at bootup on trogdor
    
    [ Upstream commit e440e30e26dd6b0424002ad0ddcbbcea783efd85 ]
    
    At boot time the following happens:
    1. Device core gets ready to probe our SPI driver.
    2. Device core applies SPI controller's "default" pinctrl.
    3. Device core calls the SPI driver's probe() function which will
       eventually setup the chip select GPIO as "unasserted".
    
    Thinking about the above, we can find:
    a) For SPI devices that the BIOS inits (Cr50 and EC), the BIOS would
       have had them configured as "GENI" pins and not as "GPIO" pins.
    b) It turns out that our BIOS also happens to init these pins as
       "output" (even though it doesn't need to since they're not muxed as
       GPIO) but leaves them at the default state of "low".
    c) As soon as we apply the "default" chip select it'll switch the
       function to GPIO and stop driving the chip select high (which is
       how "GENI" was driving it) and start driving it low.
    d) As of commit 9378f46040be ("UPSTREAM: spi: spi-geni-qcom: Use the
       new method of gpio CS control"), when the SPI core inits things it
       inits the GPIO to be "deasserted".  Prior to that commit the GPIO
       was left untouched until first use.
    e) When the first transaction happens we'll assert the chip select and
       then deassert it after done.
    
    So before the commit to change us to use gpio descriptors we used to
    have a _really long_ assertion of chip select before our first
    transaction (because it got pulled down and then the first "assert"
    was a no-op).  That wasn't great but (apparently) didn't cause any
    real harm.
    
    After the commit to change us to use gpio descriptors we end up
    glitching the chip select line during probe.  It would go low and then
    high with no data transferred.  The other side ought to be robust
    against this, but it certainly could cause some confusion.  It's known
    to at least cause an error message on the EC console and it's believed
    that, under certain timing conditions, it could be getting the EC into
    a confused state causing the EC driver to fail to probe.
    
    Let's fix things to avoid the glitch.  We'll add an extra pinctrl
    entry that sets the value of the pin to output high (CS deasserted)
    before doing anything else.  We'll do this in its own pinctrl node
    that comes before the normal pinctrl entries to ensure that the order
    is correct and that this gets applied before the mux change.
    
    This change is in the trogdor board file rather than in the SoC dtsi
    file because chip select polarity can be different depending on what's
    hooked up and it doesn't feel worth it to spam the SoC dtsi file with
    both options.  The board file would need to pick the right one anyway.

    iio: adis16480: fix pps mode sampling frequency math
    
    [ Upstream commit 0463e60f087069adf25a815cd88753946aca2565 ]
    
    When using PPS mode, the input clock needs to be scaled so that we have
    an IMU sample rate between (optimally) 4000 and 4250. After this, we can
    use the decimation filter to lower the sampling rate in order to get what
    the user wants. Optimally, the user sample rate is a multiple of both the
    IMU sample rate and the input clock. Hence, calculating the sync_scale
    dynamically gives us better chances of achieving a perfect/integer value
    for DEC_RATE. The math here is:
     1. lcm of the input clock and the desired output rate.
     2. get the highest multiple of the previous result lower than the adis
        max rate.
     3. The last result becomes the IMU sample rate. Use that to calculate
        SYNC_SCALE and DEC_RATE (to get the user output rate).

    arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e-main: Update the speed modes supported and their itap delay values for MMCSD subsystems
    
    [ Upstream commit eb8f6194e8074d7b00642dd75cf04d13e1b218e4 ]
    
    According to latest errata of J721e [1], HS400 mode is not supported
    in MMCSD0 subsystem (i2024) and SDR104 mode is not supported in MMCSD1/2
    subsystems (i2090). Therefore, replace mmc-hs400-1_8v with mmc-hs200-1_8v
    in MMCSD0 subsystem and add a sdhci mask to disable SDR104 speed mode.
    
    Also, update the itap delay values for all the MMCSD subsystems according
    the latest J721e data sheet[2]

    [ Upstream commit 55fbb9ba4f06cb6aff32daca1e1910173c13ec51 ]
    
    In qcom_probe_nand_devices() function, the error code returned by
    qcom_nand_host_init_and_register() is converted to -ENODEV in the case
    of failure. This poses issue if -EPROBE_DEFER is returned when the

    So let's restructure the error handling logic a bit and return the
    actual error code in case of qcom_nand_host_init_and_register() failure.

    mtd: Handle possible -EPROBE_DEFER from parse_mtd_partitions()
    
    [ Upstream commit 08608adb520e51403be7592c2214846fa440a23a ]
    
    There are chances that the parse_mtd_partitions() function will return
    -EPROBE_DEFER in mtd_device_parse_register(). This might happen when
    the dependency is not available for the parser. For instance, on SDX55
    the MTD_QCOMSMEM_PARTS parser depends on the QCOM_SMEM driver to parse
    the partitions defined in the shared memory region. With the current
    flow, the error returned from parse_mtd_partitions() will be discarded
    in favor of trying to add the fallback partition.
    
    This will prevent the driver to end up in probe deferred pool and the
    partitions won't be parsed even after the QCOM_SMEM driver is available.
    
    Fix this issue by bailing out of mtd_device_parse_register() when
    -EPROBE_DEFER error is returned from parse_mtd_partitions() function and
    propagate the error code to the driver core for probing later.

    serial: stm32: fix FIFO flush in startup and set_termios
    
    [ Upstream commit 315e2d8a125ad77a1bc28f621162713f3e7aef48 ]
    
    Fifo flush set USART_RQR register by calling stm32_usart_set_bits
    routine (Read/Modify/Write). USART_RQR register is a write only
    register. So, read before write isn't correct / relevant to flush
    the FIFOs.
    Replace stm32_usart_set_bits call by writel_relaxed.

    [ Upstream commit 436c97936001776f16153771ee887f125443e974 ]
    
    CTS/RTS GPIOs support that has been added recently to STM32 UART driver has
    introduced scheduled code in a set_termios part protected by a spin lock.
    This generates a potential deadlock scenario:
    
    Chain exists of:
    &irq_desc_lock_class --> console_owner --> &port_lock_key
    
    Possible unsafe locking scenario:

    serial: stm32: fix wake-up flag handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 12761869f0efa524348e2ae31827fd52eebf3f0d ]
    
    This patch fixes several issue with wake-up handling:
    - the WUF irq is handled several times at wake-up
    - the USART is disabled / enabled at suspend to set wake-up flag.
    It can cause glitches during RX.
    
    This patch fix those issues:
    - clear wake-up flag and disable wake-up irq in WUF irq handling
    - enable wake-up from low power on start bit detection at port
    configuration
    - Unmask the wake-up flag irq at suspend and mask it at resume
    
    In addition, pm_wakeup_event handling is moved from receice_chars to WUF
    irq handling.

    serial: stm32: fix a deadlock condition with wakeup event
    
    [ Upstream commit ad7676812437a00a4c6be155fc17926069f99084 ]
    
    Deadlock issue is seen when enabling CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=Y, and uart
    console as wakeup source. Deadlock occurs when resuming from low power
    mode if system is waked up via usart console.
    The deadlock is triggered 100% when also disabling console suspend prior
    to go to suspend.
    
    Simplified call stack, deadlock condition:
    - stm32_console_write <-- spin_lock already held
    - print_circular_bug
    - pm_wakeup_dev_event <-- triggers lockdep as seen above
    - stm32_receive_chars
    - stm32_interrupt <-- wakeup via uart console, takes the lock
    
    So, revisit spin_lock in stm32-usart driver:
    - there is no need to hold the lock to access ICR (atomic clear of status
      flags)
    - only hold the lock inside stm32_receive_chars() routine (no need to
      call pm_wakeup_dev_event with lock held)
    - keep stm32_transmit_chars() routine called with lock held

    TX and RX FIFO thresholds may be cleared after suspend/resume, depending
    on the low power mode.
    
    Those configurations (done in startup) are not effective for UART console,
    as:
    - the reference manual indicates that FIFOEN bit can only be written when
      the USART is disabled (UE=0)
    - a set_termios (where UE is set) is requested firstly for console
      enabling, before the startup.

    This driver casts away the constness of struct stm32_usart_info that is
    pointed to by the of match table. Use of_device_get_match_data() instead
    of of_match_device() here and push the const throughout the code so that
    we don't cast away const. This nicely avoids referencing the match table
    when it is undefined with configurations where CONFIG_OF=n and fixes the
    const issues.

    The probe and remove orders are wrong as the uart_port is registered

    remove to avoid resource allocation issues.

    Terminate both DMA rx and tx transfers before removing device.

    After the commit 7320915c8861 ("mmc: Set PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS
    for drivers that existed in v4.14"), the order of /dev/mmcblkN
    was not fixed in some SoCs which have multiple sdhi controllers.
    So, we were hard to use an sdhi device as rootfs by using
    the kernel parameter like "root=/dev/mmcblkNpM".
    
    According to the discussion on a mainling list [1], we can add
    mmc aliases to fix the issue. So, add such aliases into Renesas
    arm64 board dts files. Notes that mmc0 is an eMMC channel if
    available.

    ARM: dts: renesas: Add mmc aliases into R-Car Gen2 board dts files
    
    [ Upstream commit da926e813fc7f9f0912fa413981a1f5ba63a536d ]
    
    After set PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS flag on the mmc host drivers,
    the order of /dev/mmcblkN was not fixed in some SoCs which have
    multiple SDHI and/or MMCIF controllers. So, we were hard to use
    such a device as rootfs by using the kernel parameter like
    "root=/dev/mmcblkNpM".
    
    According to the discussion on a mainling list [1], we can add
    mmc aliases to fix the issue. So, add such aliases into R-Car Gen2
    board dts files. Note that, since R-Car Gen2 is even more complicated
    about SDHI and/or MMCIF channels variations and they share pins,
    add the aliases into board dts files instead of SoC dtsi files.

    commit 50a318cc9b54a36f00beadf77e578a50f3620477 upstream.
    
    The commit d3cb25a12138 ("usb: gadget: udc: fix spin_lock in pch_udc")
    obviously was not thought through and had made the situation even worse
    than it was before. Two changes after almost reverted it. but a few
    leftovers have been left as it. With this revert d3cb25a12138 completely.
    
    While at it, narrow down the scope of unlocked section to prevent
    potential race when prot_stall is assigned.
    
    Fixes: d3cb25a12138 ("usb: gadget: udc: fix spin_lock in pch_udc")
    Fixes: 9903b6bedd38 ("usb: gadget: pch-udc: fix lock")

    Revert "drm/qxl: do not run release if qxl failed to init"
    
    commit 93d8da8d7efbf690c0a9eaca798acc0c625245e6 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit b91907a6241193465ca92e357adf16822242296d.
    
    Patch is broken, it effectively makes qxl_drm_release() a nop
    because on normal driver shutdown qxl_drm_release() is called
    *after* drm_dev_unregister().

    ovl: fix missing revert_creds() on error path
    
    commit 7b279bbfd2b230c7a210ff8f405799c7e46bbf48 upstream.
    
    Smatch complains about missing that the ovl_override_creds() doesn't
    have a matching revert_creds() if the dentry is disconnected.  Fix this
    by moving the ovl_override_creds() until after the disconnected check.

    commit cb9e880a797a77c21c0f0e7ccd553da8eb4870af upstream.
    
    In stmpe_devices_init(), the start and end field of these structs are
    modified, so they can not be const. Add a comment to those structs that
    lacked it to reduce the risk that this happens again.

    Revert "i3c master: fix missing destroy_workqueue() on error in i3c_master_register"
    
    commit 0d95f41ebde40d552bb4fea64b1d618607915fd6 upstream.
    
    Adding the destroy_workqueue call in i3c_master_register introduced below
    kernel warning because it makes duplicate destroy_workqueue calls when
    i3c_master_register fails after allocating the workqueue. The workqueue will
    be destroyed by i3c_masterdev_release which is called by put_device at the
    end of the i3c_master_register function eventually in failure cases so the
    workqueue doesn't need to be destroyed in i3c_master_register.

    KVM: selftests: Always run vCPU thread with blocked SIG_IPI
    
    commit bf1e15a82e3b74ee86bb119d6038b41e1ed2b319 upstream.
    
    The main thread could start to send SIG_IPI at any time, even before signal
    blocked on vcpu thread.  Therefore, start the vcpu thread with the signal
    blocked.
    
    Without this patch, on very busy cores the dirty_log_test could fail directly
    on receiving a SIGUSR1 without a handler (when vcpu runs far slower than main).

    KVM: selftests: Sync data verify of dirty logging with guest sync
    
    commit 016ff1a442d9a8f36dcb3beca0bcdfc35e281e18 upstream.
    
    This fixes a bug that can trigger with e.g. "taskset -c 0 ./dirty_log_test" or
    when the testing host is very busy.
    
    A similar previous attempt is done [1] but that is not enough, the reason is
    stated in the reply [2].
    
    As a summary (partly quotting from [2]):
    
    The problem is I think one guest memory write operation (of this specific test)
    contains a few micro-steps when page is during kvm dirty tracking (here I'm
    only considering write-protect rather than pml but pml should be similar at
    least when the log buffer is full):
    
      (1) Guest read 'iteration' number into register, prepare to write, page fault
      (2) Set dirty bit in either dirty bitmap or dirty ring
      (3) Return to guest, data written
    
    When we verify the data, we assumed that all these steps are "atomic", say,
    when (1) happened for this page, we assume (2) & (3) must have happened.  We
    had some trick to workaround "un-atomicity" of above three steps, as previous
    version of this patch wanted to fix atomicity of step (2)+(3) by explicitly
    letting the main thread wait for at least one vmenter of vcpu thread, which
    should work.  However what I overlooked is probably that we still have race
    when (1) and (2) can be interrupted.
    
    One example calltrace when it could happen that we read an old interation, got
    interrupted before even setting the dirty bit and flushing data:
    
        __schedule+1742
        __cond_resched+52
        __get_user_pages+530
        get_user_pages_unlocked+197
        hva_to_pfn+206
        try_async_pf+132
        direct_page_fault+320
        kvm_mmu_page_fault+103
        vmx_handle_exit+288
        vcpu_enter_guest+2460
        kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+325
        kvm_vcpu_ioctl+526
        __x64_sys_ioctl+131
        do_syscall_64+51
        entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+68
    
    It means iteration number cached in vcpu register can be very old when dirty
    bit set and data flushed.
    
    So far I don't see an easy way to guarantee all steps 1-3 atomicity but to sync
    at the GUEST_SYNC() point of guest code when we do verification of the dirty
    bits as what this patch does.

    commit 53b16dd6ba5cf64ed147ac3523ec34651d553cb0 upstream.
    
    The doc says:
    "The characteristics of a specific redistributor region can
     be read by presetting the index field in the attr data.
     Only valid for KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC_V3"
    
    Unfortunately the existing code fails to read the input attr data.

    KVM: arm64: Fully zero the vcpu state on reset
    
    commit 85d703746154cdc6794b6654b587b0b0354c97e9 upstream.
    
    On vcpu reset, we expect all the registers to be brought back
    to their initial state, which happens to be a bunch of zeroes.
    
    However, some recent commit broke this, and is now leaving a bunch
    of registers (such as the FP state) with whatever was left by the
    guest. My bad.
    
    Zero the reset of the state (32bit SPSRs and FPSIMD state).

    KVM: Stop looking for coalesced MMIO zones if the bus is destroyed
    
    commit 5d3c4c79384af06e3c8e25b7770b6247496b4417 upstream.
    
    Abort the walk of coalesced MMIO zones if kvm_io_bus_unregister_dev()
    fails to allocate memory for the new instance of the bus.  If it can't
    instantiate a new bus, unregister_dev() destroys all devices _except_ the
    target device.   But, it doesn't tell the caller that it obliterated the
    bus and invoked the destructor for all devices that were on the bus.  In
    the coalesced MMIO case, this can result in a deleted list entry
    dereference due to attempting to continue iterating on coalesced_zones
    after future entries (in the walk) have been deleted.
    
    Opportunistically add curly braces to the for-loop, which encompasses
    many lines but sneaks by without braces due to the guts being a single
    if statement.

    KVM: Destroy I/O bus devices on unregister failure _after_ sync'ing SRCU
    
    commit 2ee3757424be7c1cd1d0bbfa6db29a7edd82a250 upstream.
    
    If allocating a new instance of an I/O bus fails when unregistering a
    device, wait to destroy the device until after all readers are guaranteed
    to see the new null bus.  Destroying devices before the bus is nullified
    could lead to use-after-free since readers expect the devices on their
    reference of the bus to remain valid.

    When reading the base address of the a REDIST region
    through KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST we expect the
    redistributor region list to be populated with a single
    element.

    Instead we should use list_first_entry_or_null which effectively
    returns NULL if the list is empty.

    Defer reloading the MMU after a EPTP successful EPTP switch.  The VMFUNC
    instruction itself is executed in the previous EPTP context, any side
    effects, e.g. updating RIP, should occur in the old context.  Practically
    speaking, this bug is benign as VMX doesn't touch the MMU when skipping
    an emulated instruction, nor does queuing a single-step #DB.  No other
    post-switch side effects exist.

    KVM: SVM: Do not allow SEV/SEV-ES initialization after vCPUs are created
    
    commit 8727906fde6ea665b52e68ddc58833772537f40a upstream.
    
    Reject KVM_SEV_INIT and KVM_SEV_ES_INIT if they are attempted after one
    or more vCPUs have been created.  KVM assumes a VM is tagged SEV/SEV-ES
    prior to vCPU creation, e.g. init_vmcb() needs to mark the VMCB as SEV
    enabled, and svm_create_vcpu() needs to allocate the VMSA.  At best,
    creating vCPUs before SEV/SEV-ES init will lead to unexpected errors
    and/or behavior, and at worst it will crash the host, e.g.
    sev_launch_update_vmsa() will dereference a null svm->vmsa pointer.

    KVM: SVM: Do not set sev->es_active until KVM_SEV_ES_INIT completes
    
    commit 9fa1521daafb58d878d03d75f6863a11312fae22 upstream.
    
    Set sev->es_active only after the guts of KVM_SEV_ES_INIT succeeds.  If
    the command fails, e.g. because SEV is already active or there are no
    available ASIDs, then es_active will be left set even though the VM is
    not fully SEV-ES capable.
    
    Refactor the code so that "es_active" is passed on the stack instead of
    being prematurely shoved into sev_info, both to avoid having to unwind
    sev_info and so that it's more obvious what actually consumes es_active
    in sev_guest_init() and its helpers.

    KVM: SVM: Use online_vcpus, not created_vcpus, to iterate over vCPUs
    
    commit c36b16d29f3af5f32fc1b2a3401bf48f71cabee1 upstream.
    
    Use the kvm_for_each_vcpu() helper to iterate over vCPUs when encrypting
    VMSAs for SEV, which effectively switches to use online_vcpus instead of
    created_vcpus.  This fixes a possible null-pointer dereference as
    created_vcpus does not guarantee a vCPU exists, since it is updated at
    the very beginning of KVM_CREATE_VCPU.  created_vcpus exists to allow the
    bulk of vCPU creation to run in parallel, while still correctly
    restricting the max number of max vCPUs.

    is false, it will not be updated in preemption notifiers after this commit which
    means that the kernel spinlock lock holder will always be skipped to boost. Let's
    fix it by always treating preempted is in the guest kernel mode, false positive
    is better than skip completely.

    page, when shadowing 32-bit NPT with 64-bit NPT, i.e. when running a
    32-bit L1.  KVM currently only allocates the page when NPT is disabled,
    or when L0 is 32-bit (using PAE paging).
    
    Note, there is an existing memory leak involving the MMU roots, as KVM
    fails to free the PAE roots on failure.  This will be addressed in a
    future commit.

    commit 5ac14bac08ae827b619f21bcceaaac3b8c497e31 upstream.
    
    Extend kvm_s390_shadow_fault to return the pointer to the valid leaf
    DAT table entry, or to the invalid entry.
    
    Also return some flags in the lower bits of the address:
    PEI_DAT_PROT: indicates that DAT protection applies because of the
                  protection bit in the segment (or, if EDAT, region) tables.
    PEI_NOT_PTE: indicates that the address of the DAT table entry returned
                 does not refer to a PTE, but to a segment or region table.

    commit c5d1f6b531e68888cbe6718b3f77a60115d58b9c upstream.
    
    A new function _kvm_s390_real_to_abs will apply prefixing to a real address
    with a given prefix value.
    
    The old kvm_s390_real_to_abs becomes now a wrapper around the new function.
    
    This is needed to avoid code duplication in vSIE.

    s390: fix detection of vector enhancements facility 1 vs. vector packed decimal facility
    
    commit b208108638c4bd3215792415944467c36f5dfd97 upstream.
    
    The PoP documents:
            134: The vector packed decimal facility is installed in the
                 z/Architecture architectural mode. When bit 134 is
                 one, bit 129 is also one.
            135: The vector enhancements facility 1 is installed in
                 the z/Architecture architectural mode. When bit 135
                 is one, bit 129 is also one.
    
    Looks like we confuse the vector enhancements facility 1 ("EXT") with the
    Vector packed decimal facility ("BCD"). Let's fix the facility checks.
    
    Detected while working on QEMU/tcg z14 support and only unlocking
    the vector enhancements facility 1, but not the vector packed decimal
    facility.

    KVM: s390: fix guarded storage control register handling
    
    commit 44bada28219031f9e8e86b84460606efa57b871e upstream.
    
    store_regs_fmt2() has an ordering problem: first the guarded storage
    facility is enabled on the local cpu, then preemption disabled, and
    then the STGSC (store guarded storage controls) instruction is
    executed.
    
    If the process gets scheduled away between enabling the guarded
    storage facility and before preemption is disabled, this might lead to
    a special operation exception and therefore kernel crash as soon as
    the process is scheduled back and the STGSC instruction is executed.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix speaker amp on HP Envy AiO 32
    
    commit 622464c893142f7beac89f5ba8c9773bca5e5004 upstream.
    
    HP Envy AiO 32-a12xxx has an external amp that is controlled via GPIO
    bit 0x04.  However, unlike other devices, this amp seems to shut down
    itself after the certain period, hence the OS needs to up/down the bit
    dynamically only during the actual playback.
    
    This patch adds the control of the GPIO bit via the existing pcm_hook
    mechanism.  Ideally it should be triggered at the actual stream start,
    but we have only the state change at prepare/cleanup, so use those for
    switching the GPIO bit on/off.  This should be good enough for the
    purpose, and was actually confirmed to work fine.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: ALC285 Thinkpad jack pin quirk is unreachable
    
    commit 266fd994b2b0ab7ba3e5541868838ce30775964b upstream.
    
    In 9bbb94e57df1 ("ALSA: hda/realtek: fix static noise on ALC285 Lenovo
    laptops") an existing Lenovo quirk was made more generic by removing a
    0x12 pin requirement from the entry. This made the second chance table
    Thinkpad jack entry unreachable as the pin configurations became
    identical.
    
    Revert the 0x12 pin requirement removal and move Thinkpad jack pin quirk
    back to the primary pin table as they can co-exist when more specific
    configurations come first.
    
    Add a more targeted pin quirk for Lenovo devices that have 0x12 as
    0x40000000.
    
    Tested on Yoga 6 (AMD) laptop.

    commit defce244b01ee12534910a4544e11be5eb927d25 upstream.
    
    The quirk entry for Uniwill ECS M31EI is with the PCI SSID device 0,
    which means matching with all.  That is, it's essentially equivalent
    with SND_PCI_QUIRK_VENDOR(0x1584), which also matches with the
    previous entry for Haier W18 applying the very same quirk.
    
    Let's unify them with the single vendor-quirk entry.

    Starting with Vega the hardware supports concurrent flushes

    allocation.
    
    But concurrent flushes are mutual exclusive with back to

    drm/amd/display: Reject non-zero src_y and src_x for video planes
    
    commit d89f6048bdcb6a56abb396c584747d5eeae650db upstream.
    
    [Why]
    This hasn't been well tested and leads to complete system hangs on DCN1
    based systems, possibly others.
    
    The system hang can be reproduced by gesturing the video on the YouTube
    Android app on ChromeOS into full screen.
    
    [How]
    Reject atomic commits with non-zero drm_plane_state.src_x or src_y values.
    
    v2:
     - Add code comment describing the reason we're rejecting non-zero
       src_x and src_y
     - Drop gerrit Change-Id
     - Add stable CC
     - Based on amd-staging-drm-next

    drm: bridge/panel: Cleanup connector on bridge detach
    
    commit 4d906839d321c2efbf3fed4bc31ffd9ff55b75c0 upstream.
    
    If we don't call drm_connector_cleanup() manually in
    panel_bridge_detach(), the connector will be cleaned up with the other
    DRM objects in the call to drm_mode_config_cleanup(). However, since our
    drm_connector is devm-allocated, by the time drm_mode_config_cleanup()
    will be called, our connector will be long gone. Therefore, the
    connector must be cleaned up when the bridge is detached to avoid
    use-after-free conditions.
    
    v2: Cleanup connector only if it was created
    
    v3: Add FIXME
    
    v4: (Use connector->dev) directly in if() block

    FDDI: defxx: Make MMIO the configuration default except for EISA
    
    commit 193ced4a79599352d63cb8c9e2f0c6043106eb6a upstream.
    
    Recent versions of the PCI Express specification have deprecated support
    for I/O transactions and actually some PCIe host bridges, such as Power
    Systems Host Bridge 4 (PHB4), do not implement them.
    
    The default kernel configuration choice for the defxx driver is the use
    of I/O ports rather than MMIO for PCI and EISA systems.  It may have
    made sense as a conservative backwards compatible choice back when MMIO
    operation support was added to the driver as a part of TURBOchannel bus
    support.  However nowadays this configuration choice makes the driver
    unusable with systems that do not implement I/O transactions for PCIe.
    
    Make DEFXX_MMIO the configuration default then, except where configured
    for EISA.  This exception is because an EISA adapter can have its MMIO
    decoding disabled with ECU (EISA Configuration Utility) and therefore
    not available with the resource allocation infrastructure we implement,
    while port I/O is always readily available as it uses slot-specific
    addressing, directly mapped to the slot an option card has been placed
    in and handled with our EISA bus support core.  Conversely a kernel that
    supports modern systems which may not have I/O transactions implemented
    for PCIe will usually not be expected to handle legacy EISA systems.
    
    The change of the default will make it easier for people, including but
    not limited to distribution packagers, to make a working choice for the
    driver.
    
    Update the option description accordingly and while at it replace the
    potentially ambiguous PIO acronym with IOP for "port I/O" vs "I/O ports"
    according to our nomenclature used elsewhere.

    rtw88: Fix array overrun in rtw_get_tx_power_params()
    
    commit 2ff25985ea9ccc6c9af2c77b0b49045adcc62e0e upstream.
    
    Using a kernel with the Undefined Behaviour Sanity Checker (UBSAN) enabled, the
    following array overrun is logged:

    ================================================================================
    
    The statement where an array is being overrun is shown in the following snippet:
    
            if (rate <= DESC_RATE11M)
                    tx_power = pwr_idx_2g->cck_base[group];
            else
    ====>           tx_power = pwr_idx_2g->bw40_base[group];
    
    The associated arrays are defined in main.h as follows:
    
    struct rtw_2g_txpwr_idx {
            u8 cck_base[6];
            u8 bw40_base[5];
            struct rtw_2g_1s_pwr_idx_diff ht_1s_diff;
            struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_2s_diff;
            struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_3s_diff;
            struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_4s_diff;
    };
    
    The problem arises because the value of group is 5 for channel 14. The trivial
    increase in the dimension of bw40_base fails as this struct must match the layout of
    efuse. The fix is to add the rate as an argument to rtw_get_channel_group() and set
    the group for channel 14 to 4 if rate <= DESC_RATE11M.
    
    This patch fixes commit fa6dfe6bff24 ("rtw88: resolve order of tx power setting routines")

    MIPS: generic: Update node names to avoid unit addresses
    
    commit e607ff630c6053ecc67502677c0e50053d7892d4 upstream.
    
    With the latest mkimage from U-Boot 2021.04, the generic defconfigs no
    longer build, failing with:
    
    /usr/bin/mkimage: verify_header failed for FIT Image support with exit code 1
    
    This is expected after the linked U-Boot commits because '@' is
    forbidden in the node names due to the way that libfdt treats nodes with
    the same prefix but different unit addresses.
    
    Switch the '@' in the node name to '-'. Drop the unit addresses from the
    hash and kernel child nodes because there is only one node so they do
    not need to have a number to differentiate them.

    md: Fix missing unused status line of /proc/mdstat
    
    commit 7abfabaf5f805f5171d133ce6af9b65ab766e76a upstream.
    
    Reading /proc/mdstat with a read buffer size that would not
    fit the unused status line in the first read will skip this
    line from the output.
    
    So 'dd if=/proc/mdstat bs=64 2>/dev/null' will not print something
    like: unused devices: <none>
    
    Don't return NULL immediately in start() for v=2 but call
    show() once to print the status line also for multiple reads.

    md: md_open returns -EBUSY when entering racing area
    
    commit 6a4db2a60306eb65bfb14ccc9fde035b74a4b4e7 upstream.
    
    commit d3374825ce57 ("md: make devices disappear when they are no longer
    needed.") introduced protection between mddev creating & removing. The
    md_open shouldn't create mddev when all_mddevs list doesn't contain
    mddev. With currently code logic, there will be very easy to trigger
    soft lockup in non-preempt env.
    
    This patch changes md_open returning from -ERESTARTSYS to -EBUSY, which
    will break the infinitely retry when md_open enter racing area.
    
    This patch is partly fix soft lockup issue, full fix needs mddev_find
    is split into two functions: mddev_find & mddev_find_or_alloc. And
    md_open should call new mddev_find (it only does searching job).
    
    For more detail, please refer with Christoph's "split mddev_find" patch
    in later commits.
    
    *** env ***
    kvm-qemu VM 2C1G with 2 iscsi luns
    kernel should be non-preempt
    
    *** script ***
    
    about trigger every time with below script
    
    ```
    1  node1="mdcluster1"
    2  node2="mdcluster2"
    3
    4  mdadm -Ss
    5  ssh ${node2} "mdadm -Ss"
    6  wipefs -a /dev/sda /dev/sdb
    7  mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -b clustered -e 1.2 -n 2 -l mirror /dev/sda \
       /dev/sdb --assume-clean
    8
    9  for i in {1..10}; do
    10    echo ==== $i ====;
    11
    12    echo "test  ...."
    13    ssh ${node2} "mdadm -A /dev/md0 /dev/sda /dev/sdb"
    14    sleep 1
    15
    16    echo "clean  ....."
    17    ssh ${node2} "mdadm -Ss"
    18 done
    ```
    
    I use mdcluster env to trigger soft lockup, but it isn't mdcluster
    speical bug. To stop md array in mdcluster env will do more jobs than
    non-cluster array, which will leave enough time/gap to allow kernel to
    run md_open.

    "mdadm -A" (or other array assemble commands) will start a daemon "mdadm
    --monitor" by default. When "mdadm -Ss" is running, the stop action will
    wakeup "mdadm --monitor". The "--monitor" daemon will immediately get
    info from /proc/mdstat. This time mddev in kernel still exist, so
    /proc/mdstat still show md device, which makes "mdadm --monitor" to open
    /dev/md0.
    
    The previously "mdadm -Ss" is removing action, the "mdadm --monitor"
    open action will trigger md_open which is creating action. Racing is
    happening.
    
    ```
    <thread 1>: "mdadm -Ss"
    md_release
      mddev_put deletes mddev from all_mddevs
      queue_work for mddev_delayed_delete
      at this time, "/dev/md0" is still available for opening
    
    <thread 2>: "mdadm --monitor ..."
    md_open
     + mddev_find can't find mddev of /dev/md0, and create a new mddev and
     |    return.
     + trigger "if (mddev->gendisk != bdev->bd_disk)" and return
          -ERESTARTSYS.
    ```
    
    In non-preempt kernel, <thread 2> is occupying on current CPU. and
    mddev_delayed_delete which was created in <thread 1> also can't be
    schedule.
    
    In preempt kernel, it can also trigger above racing. But kernel doesn't
    allow one thread running on a CPU all the time. after <thread 2> running
    some time, the later "mdadm -A" (refer above script line 13) will call
    md_alloc to alloc a new gendisk for mddev. it will break md_open
    statement "if (mddev->gendisk != bdev->bd_disk)" and return 0 to caller,
    the soft lockup is broken.

    bio in the above stack is a bitmap write whose completion is invoked after
    the tear down sequence sets the mddev structure to NULL in rdev.
    
    During tear down, there is an attempt to flush the bitmap writes, but for
    external bitmaps, there is no explicit wait for all the bitmap writes to
    complete. For instance, md_bitmap_flush() is called to flush the bitmap
    writes, but the last call to md_bitmap_daemon_work() in md_bitmap_flush()
    could generate new bitmap writes for which there is no explicit wait to
    complete those writes. The call to md_bitmap_update_sb() will return
    simply for external bitmaps and the follow-up call to md_update_sb() is
    conditional and may not get called for external bitmaps. This results in a
    kernel panic when the completion routine, super_written() is called which
    tries to reference mddev in the rdev that has been set to
    NULL(in unbind_rdev_from_array() by tear down sequence).
    
    The solution is to call md_super_wait() for external bitmaps after the
    last call to md_bitmap_daemon_work() in md_bitmap_flush() to ensure there
    are no pending bitmap writes before proceeding with the tear down.

    async_xor: increase src_offs when dropping destination page
    
    commit ceaf2966ab082bbc4d26516f97b3ca8a676e2af8 upstream.
    
    Now we support sharing one page if PAGE_SIZE is not equal stripe size. To
    support this, it needs to support calculating xor value with different
    offsets for each r5dev. One offset array is used to record those offsets.
    
    In RMW mode, parity page is used as a source page. It sets
    ASYNC_TX_XOR_DROP_DST before calculating xor value in ops_run_prexor5.
    So it needs to add src_list and src_offs at the same time. Now it only
    needs src_list. So the xor value which is calculated is wrong. It can
    cause data corruption problem.
    
    I can reproduce this problem 100% on a POWER8 machine. The steps are:
    
      mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -l5 -n3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 --size=3G
      mkfs.xfs /dev/md0
      mount /dev/md0 /mnt/test
      mount: /mnt/test: mount(2) system call failed: Structure needs cleaning.

    x86, sched: Treat Intel SNC topology as default, COD as exception
    
    commit 2c88d45edbb89029c1190bb3b136d2602f057c98 upstream.
    
    Commit 1340ccfa9a9a ("x86,sched: Allow topologies where NUMA nodes
    share an LLC") added a vendor and model specific check to never
    call topology_sane() for Intel Skylake Server systems where NUMA
    nodes share an LLC.
    
    Intel Ice Lake and Sapphire Rapids CPUs also enumerate an LLC that is
    shared by multiple NUMA nodes. The LLC on these CPUs is shared for
    off-package data access but private to the NUMA node for on-package
    access. Rather than managing a list of allowable SNC topologies, make
    this SNC topology the default, and treat Intel's Cluster-On-Die (COD)
    topology as the exception.
    
    In SNC mode, Sky Lake, Ice Lake, and Sapphire Rapids servers do not
    emit this warning:
    
    sched: CPU #3's llc-sibling CPU #0 is not on the same node! [node: 1 != 0]. Ignoring dependency.

    selinux: add proper NULL termination to the secclass_map permissions
    
    commit e4c82eafb609c2badc56f4e11bc50fcf44b8e9eb upstream.
    
    This patch adds the missing NULL termination to the "bpf" and
    "perf_event" object class permission lists.
    
    This missing NULL termination should really only affect the tools
    under scripts/selinux, with the most important being genheaders.c,
    although in practice this has not been an issue on any of my dev/test
    systems.  If the problem were to manifest itself it would likely
    result in bogus permissions added to the end of the object class;
    thankfully with no access control checks using these bogus
    permissions and no policies defining these permissions the impact
    would likely be limited to some noise about undefined permissions
    during policy load.

    commit f7eb147d306ad2efae6837e20d2944f03be42eb4 upstream.
    
    Invoke wiz_init() before configuring anything else in Sierra/Torrent
    (invoked as part of of_platform_device_create()). wiz_init() resets the
    SERDES device and any configuration done in the probe() of
    Sierra/Torrent will be lost. In order to prevent SERDES configuration
    from getting reset, invoke wiz_init() immediately before invoking
    of_platform_device_create().

    misc: lis3lv02d: Fix false-positive WARN on various HP models
    
    commit 3641762c1c9c7cfd84a7061a0a73054f09b412e3 upstream.
    
    Before this commit lis3lv02d_get_pwron_wait() had a WARN_ONCE() to catch
    a potential divide by 0. WARN macros should only be used to catch internal
    kernel bugs and that is not the case here. We have been receiving a lot of
    bug reports about kernel backtraces caused by this WARN.
    
    The div value being checked comes from the lis3->odrs[] array. Which
    is sized to be a power-of-2 matching the number of bits in lis3->odr_mask.
    
    The only lis3 model where this array is not entirely filled with non zero
    values. IOW the only model where we can hit the div == 0 check is the
    3dc ("8 bits 3DC sensor") model:
    
    int lis3_3dc_rates[16] = {0, 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 1600, 5000};
    
    Note the 0 value at index 0, according to the datasheet an odr index of 0
    means "Power-down mode". HP typically uses a lis3 accelerometer for HDD
    fall protection. What I believe is happening here is that on newer
    HP devices, which only contain a SDD, the BIOS is leaving the lis3 device
    powered-down since it is not used for HDD fall protection.
    
    Note that the lis3_3dc_rates array initializer only specifies 10 values,
    which matches the datasheet. So it also contains 6 zero values at the end.
    
    Replace the WARN with a normal check, which treats an odr index of 0
    as power-down and uses a normal dev_err() to report the error in case
    odr index point past the initialized part of the array.

    sc16is7xx: Defer probe if device read fails
    
    commit 158e800e0fde91014812f5cdfb92ce812e3a33b4 upstream.
    
    A test was added to the probe function to ensure the device was
    actually connected and working before successfully completing a
    probe.  If the device was actually there, but the I2C bus was not
    ready yet for whatever reason, the probe fails permanently.
    
    Change the probe so that we defer the probe on a regmap read
    failure so that we try the probe again when the dependent drivers
    are potentially loaded.  This should not affect the case where the
    device truly isn't present because the probe will never successfully
    complete.

    Defer unloading the MMU after a INVPCID until the instruction emulation
    has completed, i.e. until after RIP has been updated.
    
    On VMX, this is a benign bug as VMX doesn't touch the MMU when skipping
    an emulated instruction.  However, on SVM, if nrip is disabled, the
    emulator is used to skip an instruction, which would lead to fireworks
    if the emulator were invoked without a valid MMU.

    104daa71b396 ("PCI: Determine actual VPD size on first access") limits
    reads to the actual size of VPD, which should prevent these NMIs.
    
    104daa71b396 was merged *before* 0d5370d1d852, but we think the testing
    that prompted 0d5370d1d852 ("PCI: Prevent VPD access for QLogic ISP2722")
    was done with a kernel that lacked 104daa71b396.  See [1, 2].
    
    Remove the quirk added by 0d5370d1d852 ("PCI: Prevent VPD access for QLogic
    ISP2722") so customers can read the HBA VPD.

    FDDI: defxx: Bail out gracefully with unassigned PCI resource for CSR
    
    commit f626ca682912fab55dff15469ce893ae16b65c7e upstream.
    
    Recent versions of the PCI Express specification have deprecated support
    for I/O transactions and actually some PCIe host bridges, such as Power
    Systems Host Bridge 4 (PHB4), do not implement them.
    
    For those systems the PCI BARs that request a mapping in the I/O space
    have the length recorded in the corresponding PCI resource set to zero,
    which makes it unassigned:
    
    # lspci -s 0031:02:04.0 -v
    0031:02:04.0 FDDI network controller: Digital Equipment Corporation PCI-to-PDQ Interface Chip [PFI] FDDI (DEFPA) (rev 02)
            Subsystem: Digital Equipment Corporation FDDIcontroller/PCI (DEFPA)
            Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 136, IRQ 57, NUMA node 8
            Memory at 620c080020000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128]
            I/O ports at <unassigned> [disabled]
            Memory at 620c080030000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]
            Capabilities: [50] Power Management version 2
            Kernel driver in use: defxx
            Kernel modules: defxx
    
    #
    
    Regardless the driver goes ahead and requests it (here observed with a
    Raptor Talos II POWER9 system), resulting in an odd /proc/ioport entry:
    
    # cat /proc/ioports
    00000000-ffffffffffffffff : 0031:02:04.0
    #
    
    Furthermore, the system gets confused as the driver actually continues
    and pokes at those locations, causing a flood of messages being output
    to the system console by the underlying system firmware, like:
    
    defxx: v1.11 2014/07/01  Lawrence V. Stefani and others
    defxx 0031:02:04.0: enabling device (0140 -> 0142)
    LPC[000]: Got SYNC no-response error. Error address reg: 0xd0010000
    IPMI: dropping non severe PEL event
    LPC[000]: Got SYNC no-response error. Error address reg: 0xd0010014
    IPMI: dropping non severe PEL event
    LPC[000]: Got SYNC no-response error. Error address reg: 0xd0010014
    IPMI: dropping non severe PEL event
    
    and so on and so on (possibly intermixed actually, as there's no locking
    between the kernel and the firmware in console port access with this
    particular system, but cleaned up above for clarity), and once some 10k
    of such pairs of the latter two messages have been produced an interace
    eventually shows up in a useless state:
    
    0031:02:04.0: DEFPA at I/O addr = 0x0, IRQ = 57, Hardware addr = 00-00-00-00-00-00
    
    This was not expected to happen as resource handling was added to the
    driver a while ago, because it was not known at that time that a PCI
    system would be possible that cannot assign port I/O resources, and
    oddly enough `request_region' does not fail, which would have caught it.
    
    Correct the problem then by checking for the length of zero for the CSR
    resource and bail out gracefully refusing to register an interface if
    that turns out to be the case, producing messages like:
    
    defxx: v1.11 2014/07/01  Lawrence V. Stefani and others
    0031:02:04.0: Cannot use I/O, no address set, aborting
    0031:02:04.0: Recompile driver with "CONFIG_DEFXX_MMIO=y"
    
    Keep the original check for the EISA MMIO resource as implemented,
    because in that case the length is hardwired to 0x400 as a consequence
    of how the compare/mask address decoding works in the ESIC chip and it
    is only the base address that is set to zero if MMIO has been disabled
    for the adapter in EISA configuration, which in turn could be a valid
    bus address in a legacy-free system implementing PCI, especially for
    port I/O.
    
    Where the EISA MMIO resource has been disabled for the adapter in EISA
    configuration this arrangement keeps producing messages like:
    
    eisa 00:05: EISA: slot 5: DEC3002 detected
    defxx: v1.11 2014/07/01  Lawrence V. Stefani and others
    00:05: Cannot use MMIO, no address set, aborting
    00:05: Recompile driver with "CONFIG_DEFXX_MMIO=n"
    00:05: Or run ECU and set adapter's MMIO location
    
    with the last two lines now swapped for easier handling in the driver.
    
    There is no need to check for and catch the case of a port I/O resource
    not having been assigned for EISA as the adapter uses the slot-specific
    I/O space, which gets assigned by how EISA has been specified and maps
    directly to the particular slot an option card has been placed in.  And
    the EISA variant of the adapter has additional registers that are only
    accessible via the port I/O space anyway.
    
    While at it factor out the error message calls into helpers and fix an
    argument order bug with the `pr_err' call now in `dfx_register_res_err'.

    MIPS: pci-rt2880: fix slot 0 configuration
    
    commit 8e98b697006d749d745d3b174168a877bb96c500 upstream.
    
    pci_fixup_irqs() used to call pcibios_map_irq on every PCI device, which
    for RT2880 included bus 0 slot 0. After pci_fixup_irqs() got removed,
    only slots/funcs with devices attached would be called. While arguably
    the right thing, that left no chance for this driver to ever initialize
    slot 0, effectively bricking PCI and USB on RT2880 devices such as the
    Belkin F5D8235-4 v1.
    
    Slot 0 configuration needs to happen after PCI bus enumeration, but
    before any device at slot 0x11 (func 0 or 1) is talked to. That was
    determined empirically by testing on a Belkin F5D8235-4 v1 device. A
    minimal BAR 0 config write followed by read, then setting slot 0
    PCI_COMMAND to MASTER | IO | MEMORY is all that seems to be required for
    proper functionality.
    
    Tested by ensuring that full- and high-speed USB devices get enumerated
    on the Belkin F5D8235-4 v1 (with an out of tree DTS file from OpenWrt).

    MIPS: pci-mt7620: fix PLL lock check
    
    commit c15b99ae2ba9ea30da3c7cd4765b8a4707e530a6 upstream.
    
    Upstream a long-standing OpenWrt patch [0] that fixes MT7620 PCIe PLL
    lock check. The existing code checks the wrong register bit: PPLL_SW_SET
    is not defined in PPLL_CFG1 and bit 31 of PPLL_CFG1 is marked as reserved
    in the MT7620 Programming Guide. The correct bit to check for PLL lock
    is PPLL_LD (bit 23).
    
    Also reword the error message for clarity.
    
    Without this change it is unlikely that this driver ever worked with
    mainline kernel.

    ASoC: Intel: kbl_da7219_max98927: Fix kabylake_ssp_fixup function
    
    commit a523ef731ac6674dc07574f31bf44cc5bfa14e4d upstream.
    
    kabylake_ssp_fixup function uses snd_soc_dpcm to identify the
    codecs DAIs. The HW parameters are changed based on the codec DAI of the
    stream. The earlier approach to get snd_soc_dpcm was using container_of()
    macro on snd_pcm_hw_params.
    
    The structures have been modified over time and snd_soc_dpcm does not have
    snd_pcm_hw_params as a reference but as a copy. This causes the current
    driver to crash when used.
    
    This patch changes the way snd_soc_dpcm is extracted. snd_soc_pcm_runtime
    holds 2 dpcm instances (one for playback and one for capture). 2 codecs
    on the SSP are dmic (capture) and speakers (playback). Based on the
    stream direction, snd_soc_dpcm is extracted from snd_soc_pcm_runtime.
    
    Tested for all use cases of the driver.

    usb: typec: tcpm: Address incorrect values of tcpm psy for fixed supply
    
    commit f3dedafb8263ca4791a92a23f5230068f5bde008 upstream.
    
    tcpm_pd_build_request overwrites current_limit and supply_voltage
    even before port partner accepts the requests. This leaves stale
    values in current_limit and supply_voltage that get exported by
    "tcpm-source-psy-". Solving this problem by caching the request
    values of current limit/supply voltage in req_current_limit
    and req_supply_voltage. current_limit/supply_voltage gets updated
    once the port partner accepts the request.

    drm: bridge: fix LONTIUM use of mipi_dsi_() functions
    
    commit ad085b3a712a89e4a48472121b231add7a8362e4 upstream.
    
    The Lontium DRM bridge drivers use mipi_dsi_() function interfaces so
    they need to select DRM_MIPI_DSI to prevent build errors.

    usb_role_switch_find_by_fwnode() returns a reference to the role-switch
    which must be put by calling usb_role_switch_put().
    
    usb_role_switch_put() calls module_put(sw->dev.parent->driver->owner),
    add a matching try_module_get() to usb_role_switch_find_by_fwnode(),
    making it behave the same as the other usb_role_switch functions
    which return a reference.
    
    This avoids a WARN_ON being hit at kernel/module.c:1158 due to the
    module-refcount going below 0.

    Revert "USB: cdc-acm: fix rounding error in TIOCSSERIAL"
    
    commit 729f7955cb987c5b7d7e54c87c5ad71c789934f7 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit b401f8c4f492cbf74f3f59c9141e5be3071071bb.
    
    The offending commit claimed that trying to set the values reported back
    by TIOCGSERIAL as a regular user could result in an -EPERM error when HZ
    is 250, but that was never the case.
    
    With HZ=250, the default 0.5 second value of close_delay is converted to
    125 jiffies when set and is converted back to 50 centiseconds by
    TIOCGSERIAL as expected (not 12 cs as was claimed, even if that was the
    case before an earlier fix).
    
    Comparing the internal current and new jiffies values is just fine to
    determine if the value is about to change so drop the bogus workaround
    (which was also backported to stable).
    
    For completeness: With different default values for these parameters or
    with a HZ value not divisible by two, the lack of rounding when setting
    the default values in tty_port_init() could result in an -EPERM being
    returned, but this is hardly something we need to worry about.

    io_uring: truncate lengths larger than MAX_RW_COUNT on provide buffers
    
    commit d1f82808877bb10d3deee7cf3374a4eb3fb582db upstream.
    
    Read and write operations are capped to MAX_RW_COUNT. Some read ops rely on
    that limit, and that is not guaranteed by the IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS.
    
    Truncate those lengths when doing io_add_buffers, so buffer addresses still
    use the uncapped length.
    
    Also, take the chance and change struct io_buffer len member to __u32, so
    it matches struct io_provide_buffer len member.
    
    This fixes CVE-2021-3491, also reported as ZDI-CAN-13546.

    net/nfc: fix use-after-free llcp_sock_bind/connect
    
    commit c61760e6940dd4039a7f5e84a6afc9cdbf4d82b6 upstream.
    
    Commits 8a4cd82d ("nfc: fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect()")
    and c33b1cc62 ("nfc: fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind()")
    fixed a refcount leak bug in bind/connect but introduced a
    use-after-free if the same local is assigned to 2 different sockets.
    
    This can be triggered by the following simple program:
        int sock1 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP );
        int sock2 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP );
        memset( &addr, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) );
        addr.sa_family = AF_NFC;
        addr.nfc_protocol = NFC_PROTO_NFC_DEP;
        bind( sock1, (struct sockaddr*) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) )
        bind( sock2, (struct sockaddr*) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) )
        close(sock1);
        close(sock2);
    
    Fix this by assigning NULL to llcp_sock->local after calling
    nfc_llcp_local_put.
    
    This addresses CVE-2021-23134.

    bluetooth: eliminate the potential race condition when removing the HCI controller
    
    commit e2cb6b891ad2b8caa9131e3be70f45243df82a80 upstream.
    
    There is a possible race condition vulnerability between issuing a HCI
    command and removing the cont.  Specifically, functions hci_req_sync()
    and hci_dev_do_close() can race each other like below:
    
    thread-A in hci_req_sync()      |   thread-B in hci_dev_do_close()
                                    |   hci_req_sync_lock(hdev);
    test_bit(HCI_UP, &hdev->flags); |

    hci_req_sync_lock(hdev);        |
                                    |
    In this commit we alter the sequence in function hci_req_sync(). Hence,

    Bluetooth: verify AMP hci_chan before amp_destroy
    
    commit 5c4c8c9544099bb9043a10a5318130a943e32fc3 upstream.
    
    hci_chan can be created in 2 places: hci_loglink_complete_evt() if
    it is an AMP hci_chan, or l2cap_conn_add() otherwise. In theory,
    Only AMP hci_chan should be removed by a call to
    hci_disconn_loglink_complete_evt(). However, the controller might mess
    up, call that function, and destroy an hci_chan which is not initiated
    by hci_loglink_complete_evt().
    
    This patch adds a verification that the destroyed hci_chan must have
    been init'd by hci_loglink_complete_evt().
