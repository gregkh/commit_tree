    sr: pass down correctly sized SCSI sense buffer
    
    commit f7068114d45ec55996b9040e98111afa56e010fe upstream.
    
    We're casting the CDROM layer request_sense to the SCSI sense
    buffer, but the former is 64 bytes and the latter is 96 bytes.
    As we generally allocate these on the stack, we end up blowing
    up the stack.
    
    Fix this by wrapping the scsi_execute() call with a properly
    sized sense buffer, and copying back the bits for the CDROM
    layer.

    posix-timers: Sanitize overrun handling
    
    commit 78c9c4dfbf8c04883941445a195276bb4bb92c76 upstream.
    
    The posix timer overrun handling is broken because the forwarding functions
    can return a huge number of overruns which does not fit in an int. As a
    consequence timer_getoverrun(2) and siginfo::si_overrun can turn into
    random number generators.
    
    The k_clock::timer_forward() callbacks return a 64 bit value now. Make
    k_itimer::ti_overrun[_last] 64bit as well, so the kernel internal
    accounting is correct. 3Remove the temporary (int) casts.
    
    Add a helper function which clamps the overrun value returned to user space
    via timer_getoverrun(2) or siginfo::si_overrun limited to a positive value
    between 0 and INT_MAX. INT_MAX is an indicator for user space that the
    overrun value has been clamped.

    ALSA: pcm: remove SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL1_INFO internal command
    
    commit e11f0f90a626f93899687b1cc909ee37dd6c5809 upstream.
    
    Drivers can implement 'struct snd_pcm_ops.ioctl' to handle some requests
    from ALSA PCM core. These requests are internal purpose in kernel land.
    Usually common set of operations are used for it.
    
    SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL1_INFO is one of the requests. According to code comment,
    it has been obsoleted in the old days.
    
    We can see old releases in ftp.alsa-project.org. The command was firstly
    introduced in v0.5.0 release as SND_PCM_IOCTL1_INFO, to allow drivers to
    fill data of 'struct snd_pcm_channel_info' type. In v0.9.0 release,
    this was obsoleted by the other commands for ioctl(2) such as
    SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_CHANNEL_INFO.
    
    This commit removes the long-abandoned command, bye.

    ARM: 8814/1: mm: improve/fix ARM v7_dma_inv_range() unaligned address handling
    
    [ Upstream commit a1208f6a822ac29933e772ef1f637c5d67838da9 ]
    
    This patch addresses possible memory corruption when
    v7_dma_inv_range(start_address, end_address) address parameters are not
    aligned to whole cache lines. This function issues "invalidate" cache
    management operations to all cache lines from start_address (inclusive)
    to end_address (exclusive). When start_address and/or end_address are
    not aligned, the start and/or end cache lines are first issued "clean &
    invalidate" operation. The assumption is this is done to ensure that any
    dirty data addresses outside the address range (but part of the first or
    last cache lines) are cleaned/flushed so that data is not lost, which
    could happen if just an invalidate is issued.
    
    The problem is that these first/last partial cache lines are issued
    "clean & invalidate" and then "invalidate". This second "invalidate" is
    not required and worse can cause "lost" writes to addresses outside the
    address range but part of the cache line. If another component writes to
    its part of the cache line between the "clean & invalidate" and
    "invalidate" operations, the write can get lost. This fix is to remove
    the extra "invalidate" operation when unaligned addressed are used.
    
    A kernel module is available that has a stress test to reproduce the
    issue and a unit test of the updated v7_dma_inv_range(). It can be
    downloaded from
    http://ftp.sageembedded.com/outgoing/linux/cache-test-20181107.tgz.
    
    v7_dma_inv_range() is call by dmac_[un]map_area(addr, len, direction)
    when the direction is DMA_FROM_DEVICE. One can (I believe) successfully
    argue that DMA from a device to main memory should use buffers aligned
    to cache line size, because the "clean & invalidate" might overwrite
    data that the device just wrote using DMA. But if a driver does use
    unaligned buffers, at least this fix will prevent memory corruption
    outside the buffer.

    [ Upstream commit 6c3516fed7b61a3527459ccfa67fab130d910610 ]
    
    I noticed that the Android v3.0.8 kernel on droid4 is using different
    keypad values from the mainline kernel and does not have issues with
    keys occasionally being stuck until pressed again. Turns out there was
    an earlier patch posted to fix this as "Input: omap-keypad: errata i689:
    Correct debounce time", but it was never reposted to fix use macros
    for timing calculations.
    
    This updated version is using macros, and also fixes the use of the
    input clock rate to use 32768KiHz instead of 32000KiHz. And we want to
    use the known good Android kernel values of 3 and 6 instead of 2 and 6
    in the earlier patch.

    bonding: fix 802.3ad state sent to partner when unbinding slave
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b5b3a3331d141e8f2a7aaae3a94dfa1e61ecbe4 ]
    
    Previously when unbinding a slave the 802.3ad implementation only told
    partner that the port is not suitable for aggregation by setting the port
    aggregation state from aggregatable to individual. This is not enough. If the
    physical layer still stays up and we only unbinded this port from the bond there
    is nothing in the aggregation status alone to prevent the partner from sending
    traffic towards us. To ensure that the partner doesn't consider this
    port at all anymore we should also disable collecting and distributing to
    signal that this actor is going away. Also clear AD_STATE_SYNCHRONIZATION to
    ensure partner exits collecting + distributing state.
    
    I have tested this behaviour againts Arista EOS switches with mlx5 cards
    (physical link stays up even when interface is down) and simulated
    the same situation virtually Linux <-> Linux with two network namespaces
    running two veth device pairs. In both cases setting aggregation to
    individual doesn't alone prevent traffic from being to sent towards this
    port given that the link stays up in partners end. Partner still keeps
    it's end in collecting + distributing state and continues until timeout is
    reached. In most cases this means we are losing the traffic partner sends
    towards our port while we wait for timeout. This is most visible with slow
    periodic time (LACP rate slow).
    
    Other open source implementations like Open VSwitch and libreswitch, and
    vendor implementations like Arista EOS, seem to disable collecting +
    distributing to when doing similar port disabling/detaching/removing change.
    With this patch kernel implementation would behave the same way and ensure
    partner doesn't consider our actor viable anymore.

    x86/earlyprintk/efi: Fix infinite loop on some screen widths
    
    [ Upstream commit 79c2206d369b87b19ac29cb47601059b6bf5c291 ]
    
    An affected screen resolution is 1366 x 768, which width is not
    divisible by 8, the default font width. On such screens, when longer
    lines are earlyprintk'ed, overflow-to-next-line can never trigger,
    due to the left-most x-coordinate of the next character always less
    than the screen width. Earlyprintk will infinite loop in trying to
    print the rest of the string but unable to, due to the line being
    full.
    
    This patch makes the trigger consider the right-most x-coordinate,
    instead of left-most, as the value to compare against the screen
    width threshold.

    scsi: vmw_pscsi: Rearrange code to avoid multiple calls to free_irq during unload
    
    [ Upstream commit 02f425f811cefcc4d325d7a72272651e622dc97e ]
    
    Currently pvscsi_remove calls free_irq more than once as
    pvscsi_release_resources and __pvscsi_shutdown both call
    pvscsi_shutdown_intr. This results in a 'Trying to free already-free IRQ'
    warning and stack trace. To solve the problem pvscsi_shutdown_intr has been
    moved out of pvscsi_release_resources.

    powerpc: Look for "stdout-path" when setting up legacy consoles
    
    commit bf3d6afbb234156749b640b6c50f714967a85964 upstream.
    
    Commit 78e5dfea84dc ("powerpc: dts: replace 'linux,stdout-path' with
    'stdout-path'") broke the default console on a number of embedded
    PowerPC systems, because it failed to also update the code in
    arch/powerpc/kernel/legacy_serial.c to look for that property in
    addition to the old one.
    
    This fixes it.

    tracing: Fix memory leak of instance function hash filters
    
    commit 2840f84f74035e5a535959d5f17269c69fa6edc5 upstream.
    
    The following commands will cause a memory leak:
    
     # cd /sys/kernel/tracing
     # mkdir instances/foo
     # echo schedule > instance/foo/set_ftrace_filter
     # rmdir instances/foo
    
    The reason is that the hashes that hold the filters to set_ftrace_filter and
    set_ftrace_notrace are not freed if they contain any data on the instance
    and the instance is removed.
    
    Found by kmemleak detector.

    tracing: Fix memory leak in set_trigger_filter()
    
    commit 3cec638b3d793b7cacdec5b8072364b41caeb0e1 upstream.
    
    When create_event_filter() fails in set_trigger_filter(), the filter may
    still be allocated and needs to be freed. The caller expects the
    data->filter to be updated with the new filter, even if the new filter
    failed (we could add an error message by setting set_str parameter of
    create_event_filter(), but that's another update).
    
    But because the error would just exit, filter was left hanging and
    nothing could free it.
    
    Found by kmemleak detector.

    MMC: OMAP: fix broken MMC on OMAP15XX/OMAP5910/OMAP310
    
    commit e8cde625bfe8a714a856e1366bcbb259d7346095 upstream.
    
    Since v2.6.22 or so there has been reports [1] about OMAP MMC being
    broken on OMAP15XX based hardware (OMAP5910 and OMAP310). The breakage
    seems to have been caused by commit 46a6730e3ff9 ("mmc-omap: Fix
    omap to use MMC_POWER_ON") that changed clock enabling to be done
    on MMC_POWER_ON. This can happen multiple times in a row, and on 15XX
    the hardware doesn't seem to like it and the MMC just stops responding.
    Fix by memorizing the power mode and do the init only when necessary.
    
    Before the patch (on Palm TE):
    
            mmc0: new SD card at address b368
            mmcblk0: mmc0:b368 SDC   977 MiB

            Buffer I/O error on dev mmcblk0, logical block 0, async page read
             mmcblk0: unable to read partition table
    
    After the patch:
    
            mmc0: new SD card at address b368
            mmcblk0: mmc0:b368 SDC   977 MiB
             mmcblk0: p1
    
    The patch is based on a fix and analysis done by Ladislav Michl.
    
    Tested on OMAP15XX/OMAP310 (Palm TE), OMAP1710 (Nokia 770)
    and OMAP2420 (Nokia N810).

    powerpc/boot: Fix random libfdt related build errors
    
    [ Upstream commit 64c3f648c25d108f346fdc96c15180c6b7d250e9 ]
    
    Once in a while I see build errors similar to the following
    when building images from a clean tree.
    
      Building powerpc:virtex-ml507:44x/virtex5_defconfig ... failed
      ------------
      Error log:
      arch/powerpc/boot/treeboot-akebono.c:37:20: fatal error:
            libfdt.h: No such file or directory
    
      Building powerpc:bamboo:smpdev:44x/bamboo_defconfig ... failed
      ------------
      Error log:
      arch/powerpc/boot/treeboot-akebono.c:37:20: fatal error:
            libfdt.h: No such file or directory
    
      arch/powerpc/boot/treeboot-currituck.c:35:20: fatal error:
           libfdt.h: No such file or directory
    
    Rebuilds will succeed.
    
    Turns out that several source files in arch/powerpc/boot/ include
    libfdt.h, but Makefile dependencies are incomplete. Let's fix that.

    lib/rbtree-test: lower default params
    
    [ Upstream commit 0b548e33e6cb2bff240fdaf1783783be15c29080 ]
    
    Fengguang reported soft lockups while running the rbtree and interval
    tree test modules.  The logic for these tests all occur in init phase,
    and we currently are pounding with the default values for number of
    nodes and number of iterations of each test.  Reduce the latter by two
    orders of magnitude.  This does not influence the value of the tests in
    that one thousand times by default is enough to get the picture.
