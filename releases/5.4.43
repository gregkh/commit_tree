    sched/fair: Fix enqueue_task_fair() warning some more
    
    [ Upstream commit b34cb07dde7c2346dec73d053ce926aeaa087303 ]
    
    sched/fair: Fix enqueue_task_fair warning some more
    
    The recent patch, fe61468b2cb (sched/fair: Fix enqueue_task_fair warning)
    did not fully resolve the issues with the rq->tmp_alone_branch !=
    &rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list warning in enqueue_task_fair. There is a case where
    the first for_each_sched_entity loop exits due to on_rq, having incompletely
    updated the list.  In this case the second for_each_sched_entity loop can
    further modify se. The later code to fix up the list management fails to do
    what is needed because se does not point to the sched_entity which broke out
    of the first loop. The list is not fixed up because the throttled parent was
    already added back to the list by a task enqueue in a parallel child hierarchy.
    
    Address this by calling list_add_leaf_cfs_rq if there are throttled parents
    while doing the second for_each_sched_entity loop.

    sched/fair: Fix reordering of enqueue/dequeue_task_fair()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ab297bab984310267734dfbcc8104566658ebef ]
    
    Even when a cgroup is throttled, the group se of a child cgroup can still
    be enqueued and its gse->on_rq stays true. When a task is enqueued on such
    child, we still have to update the load_avg and increase
    h_nr_running of the throttled cfs. Nevertheless, the 1st
    for_each_sched_entity() loop is skipped because of gse->on_rq == true and the
    2nd loop because the cfs is throttled whereas we have to update both
    load_avg with the old h_nr_running and increase h_nr_running in such case.
    
    The same sequence can happen during dequeue when se moves to parent before
    breaking in the 1st loop.
    
    Note that the update of load_avg will effectively happen only once in order
    to sync up to the throttled time. Next call for updating load_avg will stop
    early because the clock stays unchanged.

    [ Upstream commit 6d4d22468dae3d8757af9f8b81b848a76ef4409d ]
    
    The walk through the cgroup hierarchy during the enqueue/dequeue of a task
    is split in 2 distinct parts for throttled cfs_rq without any added value
    but making code less readable.
    
    Change the code ordering such that everything related to a cfs_rq
    (throttled or not) will be done in the same loop.
    
    In addition, the same steps ordering is used when updating a cfs_rq:
    
     - update_load_avg
     - update_cfs_group
     - update *h_nr_running
    
    This reordering enables the use of h_nr_running in PELT algorithm.
    
    No functional and performance changes are expected and have been noticed
    during tests.

    tpm: check event log version before reading final events
    
    [ Upstream commit b4f1874c62168159fdb419ced4afc77c1b51c475 ]
    
    This fixes the boot issues since 5.3 on several Dell models when the TPM
    is enabled. Depending on the exact grub binary, booting the kernel would
    freeze early, or just report an error parsing the final events log.
    
    We get an event log in the SHA-1 format, which doesn't have a
    tcg_efi_specid_event_head in the first event, and there is a final events
    table which doesn't match the crypto agile format.
    __calc_tpm2_event_size reads bad "count" and "efispecid->num_algs", and
    either fails, or loops long enough for the machine to be appear frozen.
    
    So we now only parse the final events table, which is per the spec always
    supposed to be in the crypto agile format, when we got a event log in this
    format.
    
    Fixes: c46f3405692de ("tpm: Reserve the TPM final events table")

    rxrpc: Fix ack discard
    
    [ Upstream commit 441fdee1eaf050ef0040bde0d7af075c1c6a6d8b ]
    
    The Rx protocol has a "previousPacket" field in it that is not handled in
    the same way by all protocol implementations.  Sometimes it contains the
    serial number of the last DATA packet received, sometimes the sequence
    number of the last DATA packet received and sometimes the highest sequence
    number so far received.
    
    AF_RXRPC is using this to weed out ACKs that are out of date (it's possible
    for ACK packets to get reordered on the wire), but this does not work with
    OpenAFS which will just stick the sequence number of the last packet seen
    into previousPacket.
    
    The issue being seen is that big AFS FS.StoreData RPC (eg. of ~256MiB) are
    timing out when partly sent.  A trace was captured, with an additional
    tracepoint to show ACKs being discarded in rxrpc_input_ack().  Here's an
    excerpt showing the problem.
    
     52873.203230: rxrpc_tx_data: c=000004ae DATA ed1a3584:00000002 0002449c q=00024499 fl=09
    
    A DATA packet with sequence number 00024499 has been transmitted (the "q="
    field).
    
     ...
     52873.243296: rxrpc_rx_ack: c=000004ae 00012a2b DLY r=00024499 f=00024497 p=00024496 n=0
     52873.243376: rxrpc_rx_ack: c=000004ae 00012a2c IDL r=0002449b f=00024499 p=00024498 n=0
     52873.243383: rxrpc_rx_ack: c=000004ae 00012a2d OOS r=0002449d f=00024499 p=0002449a n=2
    
    The Out-Of-Sequence ACK indicates that the server didn't see DATA sequence
    number 00024499, but did see seq 0002449a (previousPacket, shown as "p=",
    skipped the number, but firstPacket, "f=", which shows the bottom of the
    window is set at that point).
    
     52873.252663: rxrpc_retransmit: c=000004ae q=24499 a=02 xp=14581537
     52873.252664: rxrpc_tx_data: c=000004ae DATA ed1a3584:00000002 000244bc q=00024499 fl=0b *RETRANS*
    
    The packet has been retransmitted.  Retransmission recurs until the peer
    says it got the packet.
    
     52873.271013: rxrpc_rx_ack: c=000004ae 00012a31 OOS r=000244a1 f=00024499 p=0002449e n=6
    
    More OOS ACKs indicate that the other packets that are already in the
    transmission pipeline are being received.  The specific-ACK list is up to 6
    ACKs and NAKs.
    
     ...
     52873.284792: rxrpc_rx_ack: c=000004ae 00012a49 OOS r=000244b9 f=00024499 p=000244b6 n=30
     52873.284802: rxrpc_retransmit: c=000004ae q=24499 a=0a xp=63505500
     52873.284804: rxrpc_tx_data: c=000004ae DATA ed1a3584:00000002 000244c2 q=00024499 fl=0b *RETRANS*
     52873.287468: rxrpc_rx_ack: c=000004ae 00012a4a OOS r=000244ba f=00024499 p=000244b7 n=31
     52873.287478: rxrpc_rx_ack: c=000004ae 00012a4b OOS r=000244bb f=00024499 p=000244b8 n=32
    
    At this point, the server's receive window is full (n=32) with presumably 1
    NAK'd packet and 31 ACK'd packets.  We can't transmit any more packets.
    
     52873.287488: rxrpc_retransmit: c=000004ae q=24499 a=0a xp=61327980
     52873.287489: rxrpc_tx_data: c=000004ae DATA ed1a3584:00000002 000244c3 q=00024499 fl=0b *RETRANS*
     52873.293850: rxrpc_rx_ack: c=000004ae 00012a4c DLY r=000244bc f=000244a0 p=00024499 n=25
    
    And now we've received an ACK indicating that a DATA retransmission was
    received.  7 packets have been processed (the occupied part of the window
    moved, as indicated by f= and n=).
    
     52873.293853: rxrpc_rx_discard_ack: c=000004ae r=00012a4c 000244a0<00024499 00024499<000244b8
    
    However, the DLY ACK gets discarded because its previousPacket has gone
    backwards (from p=000244b8, in the ACK at 52873.287478 to p=00024499 in the
    ACK at 52873.293850).
    
    We then end up in a continuous cycle of retransmit/discard.  kafs fails to
    update its window because it's discarding the ACKs and can't transmit an
    extra packet that would clear the issue because the window is full.
    OpenAFS doesn't change the previousPacket value in the ACKs because no new
    DATA packets are received with a different previousPacket number.
    
    Fix this by altering the discard check to only discard an ACK based on
    previousPacket if there was no advance in the firstPacket.  This allows us
    to transmit a new packet which will cause previousPacket to advance in the
    next ACK.
    
    The check, however, needs to allow for the possibility that previousPacket
    may actually have had the serial number placed in it instead - in which
    case it will go outside the window and we should ignore it.

    x86/unwind/orc: Fix unwind_get_return_address_ptr() for inactive tasks
    
    commit 187b96db5ca79423618dfa29a05c438c34f9e1f0 upstream.
    
    Normally, show_trace_log_lvl() scans the stack, looking for text
    addresses to print.  In parallel, it unwinds the stack with
    unwind_next_frame().  If the stack address matches the pointer returned
    by unwind_get_return_address_ptr() for the current frame, the text
    address is printed normally without a question mark.  Otherwise it's
    considered a breadcrumb (potentially from a previous call path) and it's
    printed with a question mark to indicate that the address is unreliable
    and typically can be ignored.
    
    Since the following commit:
    
      f1d9a2abff66 ("x86/unwind/orc: Don't skip the first frame for inactive tasks")
    
    ... for inactive tasks, show_trace_log_lvl() prints *only* unreliable
    addresses (prepended with '?').
    
    That happens because, for the first frame of an inactive task,
    unwind_get_return_address_ptr() returns the wrong return address
    pointer: one word *below* the task stack pointer.  show_trace_log_lvl()
    starts scanning at the stack pointer itself, so it never finds the first
    'reliable' address, causing only guesses to being printed.
    
    The first frame of an inactive task isn't a normal stack frame.  It's
    actually just an instance of 'struct inactive_task_frame' which is left
    behind by __switch_to_asm().  Now that this inactive frame is actually
    exposed to callers, fix unwind_get_return_address_ptr() to interpret it
    properly.

    are no other references to the prog, we leak the reference and the program
    remains loaded.
    
    Leak can be reproduced by running flow dissector tests from selftests/bpf:
    
      # bpftool prog list
      # ./test_flow_dissector.sh
      ...
      selftests: test_flow_dissector [PASS]

      #
    
    Fix it by detaching the flow dissector program when netns is going away.

    rxrpc: Fix the excessive initial retransmission timeout
    
    commit c410bf01933e5e09d142c66c3df9ad470a7eec13 upstream.
    
    rxrpc currently uses a fixed 4s retransmission timeout until the RTT is
    sufficiently sampled.  This can cause problems with some fileservers with
    calls to the cache manager in the afs filesystem being dropped from the
    fileserver because a packet goes missing and the retransmission timeout is
    greater than the call expiry timeout.
    
    Fix this by:
    
     (1) Copying the RTT/RTO calculation code from Linux's TCP implementation
         and altering it to fit rxrpc.
    
     (2) Altering the various users of the RTT to make use of the new SRTT
         value.
    
     (3) Replacing the use of rxrpc_resend_timeout to use the calculated RTO
         value instead (which is needed in jiffies), along with a backoff.
    
    Notes:
    
     (1) rxrpc provides RTT samples by matching the serial numbers on outgoing
         DATA packets that have the RXRPC_REQUEST_ACK set and PING ACK packets
         against the reference serial number in incoming REQUESTED ACK and
         PING-RESPONSE ACK packets.
    
     (2) Each packet that is transmitted on an rxrpc connection gets a new
         per-connection serial number, even for retransmissions, so an ACK can
         be cross-referenced to a specific trigger packet.  This allows RTT
         information to be drawn from retransmitted DATA packets also.
    
     (3) rxrpc maintains the RTT/RTO state on the rxrpc_peer record rather than
         on an rxrpc_call because many RPC calls won't live long enough to
         generate more than one sample.
    
     (4) The calculated SRTT value is in units of 8ths of a microsecond rather
         than nanoseconds.
    
    The (S)RTT and RTO values are displayed in /proc/net/rxrpc/peers.

    kasan: disable branch tracing for core runtime
    
    commit 33cd65e73abd693c00c4156cf23677c453b41b3b upstream.
    
    During early boot, while KASAN is not yet initialized, it is possible to
    enter reporting code-path and end up in kasan_report().
    
    While uninitialized, the branch there prevents generating any reports,
    however, under certain circumstances when branches are being traced
    (TRACE_BRANCH_PROFILING), we may recurse deep enough to cause kernel
    reboots without warning.
    
    To prevent similar issues in future, we should disable branch tracing
    for the core runtime.

    device-dax: don't leak kernel memory to user space after unloading kmem
    
    commit 60858c00e5f018eda711a3aa84cf62214ef62d61 upstream.
    
    Assume we have kmem configured and loaded:
    
      [root@localhost ~]# cat /proc/iomem
      ...
      140000000-33fffffff : Persistent Memory$
        140000000-1481fffff : namespace0.0
        150000000-33fffffff : dax0.0
          150000000-33fffffff : System RAM
    
    Assume we try to unload kmem. This force-unloading will work, even if
    memory cannot get removed from the system.
    
      [root@localhost ~]# rmmod kmem
      [   86.380228] removing memory fails, because memory [0x0000000150000000-0x0000000157ffffff] is onlined
      ...
      [   86.431225] kmem dax0.0: DAX region [mem 0x150000000-0x33fffffff] cannot be hotremoved until the next reboot
    
    Now, we can reconfigure the namespace:
    
      [root@localhost ~]# ndctl create-namespace --force --reconfig=namespace0.0 --mode=devdax
      [  131.409351] nd_pmem namespace0.0: could not reserve region [mem 0x140000000-0x33fffffff]dax
      [  131.410147] nd_pmem: probe of namespace0.0 failed with error -16namespace0.0 --mode=devdax
      ...
    
    This fails as expected due to the busy memory resource, and the memory
    cannot be used.  However, the dax0.0 device is removed, and along its
    name.
    
    The name of the memory resource now points at freed memory (name of the
    device):
    
      [root@localhost ~]# cat /proc/iomem
      ...
      140000000-33fffffff : Persistent Memory
        140000000-1481fffff : namespace0.0
        150000000-33fffffff : �_�^7_��/_��wR��WQ���^��� ...
        150000000-33fffffff : System RAM
    
    We have to make sure to duplicate the string.  While at it, remove the
    superfluous setting of the name and fixup a stale comment.

    s390/kaslr: add support for R_390_JMP_SLOT relocation type
    
    commit 4c1cbcbd6c56c79de2c07159be4f55386bb0bef2 upstream.
    
    With certain kernel configurations, the R_390_JMP_SLOT relocation type
    might be generated, which is not expected by the KASLR relocation code,
    and the kernel stops with the message "Unknown relocation type".
    
    This was found with a zfcpdump kernel config, where CONFIG_MODULES=n
    and CONFIG_VFIO=n. In that case, symbol_get() is used on undefined
    __weak symbols in virt/kvm/vfio.c, which results in the generation
    of R_390_JMP_SLOT relocation types.
    
    Fix this by handling R_390_JMP_SLOT similar to R_390_GLOB_DAT.

    s390/pci: Fix s390_mmio_read/write with MIO
    
    commit f058599e22d59e594e5aae1dc10560568d8f4a8b upstream.
    
    The s390_mmio_read/write syscalls are currently broken when running with
    MIO.
    
    The new pcistb_mio/pcstg_mio/pcilg_mio instructions are executed
    similiarly to normal load/store instructions and do address translation
    in the current address space. That means inside the kernel they are
    aware of mappings into kernel address space while outside the kernel
    they use user space mappings (usually created through mmap'ing a PCI
    device file).
    
    Now when existing user space applications use the s390_pci_mmio_write
    and s390_pci_mmio_read syscalls, they pass I/O addresses that are mapped
    into user space so as to be usable with the new instructions without
    needing a syscall. Accessing these addresses with the old instructions
    as done currently leads to a kernel panic.
    
    Also, for such a user space mapping there may not exist an equivalent
    kernel space mapping which means we can't just use the new instructions
    in kernel space.
    
    Instead of replicating user mappings in the kernel which then might
    collide with other mappings, we can conceptually execute the new
    instructions as if executed by the user space application using the
    secondary address space. This even allows us to directly store to the
    user pointer without the need for copy_to/from_user().

    misc: rtsx: Add short delay after exit from ASPM
    
    commit 7a839dbab1be59f5ed3b3b046de29e166784c9b4 upstream.
    
    DMA transfers to and from the SD card stall for 10 seconds and run into
    timeout on RTS5260 card readers after ASPM was enabled.
    
    Adding a short msleep after disabling ASPM fixes the issue on several
    Dell Precision 7530/7540 systems I tested.
    
    This function is only called when waking up after the chip went into
    power-save after not transferring data for a few seconds. The added
    msleep does therefore not change anything in data transfer speed or
    induce any excessive waiting while data transfers are running, or the
    chip is sleeping. Only the transition from sleep to active is affected.

    iio: adc: ti-ads8344: Fix channel selection
    
    commit bcfa1e253d2e329e1ebab5c89f3c73f6dd17606c upstream.
    
    During initial submission the selection of the channel was done using
    the scan_index member of the iio_chan_spec structure. It was an abuse
    because this member is supposed to be used with a buffer so it was
    removed.
    
    However there was still the need to be able to known how to select a
    channel, the correct member to store this information is address.

    In the "gb_tty_set_termios" function the "newline" variable is declared
    but not initialized. So the "flow_control" member is not initialized and
    the OR / AND operations with itself results in an undefined value in

    Revert "gfs2: Don't demote a glock until its revokes are written"
    
    [ Upstream commit b14c94908b1b884276a6608dea3d0b1b510338b7 ]
    
    This reverts commit df5db5f9ee112e76b5202fbc331f990a0fc316d6.
    
    This patch fixes a regression: patch df5db5f9ee112 allowed function
    run_queue() to bypass its call to do_xmote() if revokes were queued for
    the glock. That's wrong because its call to do_xmote() is what is
    responsible for calling the go_sync() glops functions to sync both
    the ail list and any revokes queued for it. By bypassing the call,
    gfs2 could get into a stand-off where the glock could not be demoted
    until its revokes are written back, but the revokes would not be
    written back because do_xmote() was never called.
    
    It "sort of" works, however, because there are other mechanisms like
    the log flush daemon (logd) that can sync the ail items and revokes,
    if it deems it necessary. The problem is: without file system pressure,
    it might never deem it necessary.

    kbuild: Remove debug info from kallsyms linking
    
    [ Upstream commit af73d78bd384aa9b8789aa6e7ddbb165f971276f ]
    
    When CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO is enabled, the two kallsyms linking steps spend
    time collecting and writing the dwarf sections to the temporary output
    files. kallsyms does not need this information, and leaving it off
    halves their linking time. This is especially noticeable without
    CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_REDUCED. The BTF linking stage, however, does still
    need those details.
    
    Refactor the BTF and kallsyms generation stages slightly for more
    regularized temporary names. Skip debug during kallsyms links.
    Additionally move "info BTF" to the correct place since commit
    8959e39272d6 ("kbuild: Parameterize kallsyms generation and correct
    reporting"), which added "info LD ..." to vmlinux_link calls.
    
    For a full debug info build with BTF, my link time goes from 1m06s to
    0m54s, saving about 12 seconds, or 18%.

    bpf: Avoid setting bpf insns pages read-only when prog is jited
    
    [ Upstream commit e1608f3fa857b600045b6df7f7dadc70eeaa4496 ]
    
    For the case where the interpreter is compiled out or when the prog is jited
    it is completely unnecessary to set the BPF insn pages as read-only. In fact,
    on frequent churn of BPF programs, it could lead to performance degradation of
    the system over time since it would break the direct map down to 4k pages when
    calling set_memory_ro() for the insn buffer on x86-64 / arm64 and there is no
    reverse operation. Thus, avoid breaking up large pages for data maps, and only
    limit this to the module range used by the JIT where it is necessary to set
    the image read-only and executable.

    powerpc/64s: Disable STRICT_KERNEL_RWX
    
    [ Upstream commit 8659a0e0efdd975c73355dbc033f79ba3b31e82c ]
    
    Several strange crashes have been eventually traced back to
    STRICT_KERNEL_RWX and its interaction with code patching.
    
    Various paths in our ftrace, kprobes and other patching code need to
    be hardened against patching failures, otherwise we can end up running
    with partially/incorrectly patched ftrace paths, kprobes or jump
    labels, which can then cause strange crashes.
    
    Although fixes for those are in development, they're not -rc material.
    
    There also seem to be problems with the underlying strict RWX logic,
    which needs further debugging.
    
    So for now disable STRICT_KERNEL_RWX on 64-bit to prevent people from
    enabling the option and tripping over the bugs.

    vsprintf: don't obfuscate NULL and error pointers
    
    commit 7bd57fbc4a4ddedc664cad0bbced1b469e24e921 upstream.
    
    I don't see what security concern is addressed by obfuscating NULL
    and IS_ERR() error pointers, printed with %p/%pK.  Given the number
    of sites where %p is used (over 10000) and the fact that NULL pointers
    aren't uncommon, it probably wouldn't take long for an attacker to
    find the hash that corresponds to 0.  Although harder, the same goes
    for most common error values, such as -1, -2, -11, -14, etc.
    
    The NULL part actually fixes a regression: NULL pointers weren't
    obfuscated until commit 3e5903eb9cff ("vsprintf: Prevent crash when
    dereferencing invalid pointers") which went into 5.2.  I'm tacking
    the IS_ERR() part on here because error pointers won't leak kernel
    addresses and printing them as pointers shouldn't be any different
    from e.g. %d with PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO().  Obfuscating them just makes
    debugging based on existing pr_debug and friends excruciating.
    
    Note that the "always print 0's for %pK when kptr_restrict == 2"
    behaviour which goes way back is left as is.
    
    Example output with the patch applied:
    
                                 ptr         error-ptr              NULL
     %p:            0000000001f8cc5b  fffffffffffffff2  0000000000000000
     %pK, kptr = 0: 0000000001f8cc5b  fffffffffffffff2  0000000000000000
     %px:           ffff888048c04020  fffffffffffffff2  0000000000000000
     %pK, kptr = 1: ffff888048c04020  fffffffffffffff2  0000000000000000
     %pK, kptr = 2: 0000000000000000  0000000000000000  0000000000000000

    The obvious fix would be to use 'spin_lock_init()' on 'pchan->lock'
    before attempting to call 'spin_lock_irqsave()' in 'owl_dma_get_pchan()'.
    
    However, according to Manivannan Sadhasivam, 'pchan->lock' was supposed
    to only protect 'pchan->vchan' while 'od->lock' does a similar job in
    'owl_dma_terminate_pchan()'.
    
    Therefore, this patch substitutes 'pchan->lock' with 'od->lock' and
    removes the 'lock' attribute in 'owl_dma_pchan' struct.

    apparmor: Fix aa_label refcnt leak in policy_update
    
    commit c6b39f070722ea9963ffe756bfe94e89218c5e63 upstream.
    
    policy_update() invokes begin_current_label_crit_section(), which
    returns a reference of the updated aa_label object to "label" with
    increased refcount.
    
    When policy_update() returns, "label" becomes invalid, so the refcount
    should be decreased to keep refcount balanced.
    
    The reference counting issue happens in one exception handling path of
    policy_update(). When aa_may_manage_policy() returns not NULL, the
    refcnt increased by begin_current_label_crit_section() is not decreased,
    causing a refcnt leak.
    
    Fix this issue by jumping to "end_section" label when
    aa_may_manage_policy() returns not NULL.

    apparmor: fix potential label refcnt leak in aa_change_profile
    
    commit a0b845ffa0d91855532b50fc040aeb2d8338dca4 upstream.
    
    aa_change_profile() invokes aa_get_current_label(), which returns
    a reference of the current task's label.
    
    According to the comment of aa_get_current_label(), the returned
    reference must be put with aa_put_label().
    However, when the original object pointed by "label" becomes
    unreachable because aa_change_profile() returns or a new object
    is assigned to "label", reference count increased by
    aa_get_current_label() is not decreased, causing a refcnt leak.
    
    Fix this by calling aa_put_label() before aa_change_profile() return
    and dropping unnecessary aa_get_current_label().

    drm/etnaviv: fix perfmon domain interation
    
    commit 40b697e256ccdb88aaff424b44b4d300eb8460e8 upstream.
    
    The GC860 has one GPU device which has a 2d and 3d core. In this case
    we want to expose perfmon information for both cores.
    
    The driver has one array which contains all possible perfmon domains
    with some meta data - doms_meta. Here we can see that for the GC860
    two elements of that array are relevant:
    
      doms_3d: is at index 0 in the doms_meta array with 8 perfmon domains
      doms_2d: is at index 1 in the doms_meta array with 1 perfmon domain
    
    The userspace driver wants to get a list of all perfmon domains and
    their perfmon signals. This is done by iterating over all domains and
    their signals. If the userspace driver wants to access the domain with
    id 8 the kernel driver fails and returns invalid data from doms_3d with
    and invalid offset.
    
    This results in:
      Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 00000000
    
    On such a device it is not possible to use the userspace driver at all.
    
    The fix for this off-by-one error is quite simple.

    arm64: Fix PTRACE_SYSEMU semantics
    
    commit 1cf6022bd9161081215028203919c33fcfa6debb upstream.
    
    Quoth the man page:
    ```
           If the tracee was restarted by PTRACE_SYSCALL or PTRACE_SYSEMU, the
           tracee enters syscall-enter-stop just prior to entering any system
           call (which will not be executed if the restart was using
           PTRACE_SYSEMU, regardless of any change made to registers at this
           point or how the tracee is restarted after this stop).
    ```
    
    The parenthetical comment is currently true on x86 and powerpc,
    but not currently true on arm64. arm64 re-checks the _TIF_SYSCALL_EMU
    flag after the syscall entry ptrace stop. However, at this point,
    it reflects which method was used to re-start the syscall
    at the entry stop, rather than the method that was used to reach it.
    Fix that by recording the original flag before performing the ptrace
    stop, bringing the behavior in line with documentation and x86/powerpc.

    scsi: target: Put lun_ref at end of tmr processing
    
    commit f2e6b75f6ee82308ef7b00f29e71e5f1c6b3d52a upstream.
    
    Testing with Loopback I found that, after a Loopback LUN has executed a
    TMR, I can no longer unlink the LUN.  The rm command hangs in
    transport_clear_lun_ref() at wait_for_completion(&lun->lun_shutdown_comp)
    The reason is, that transport_lun_remove_cmd() is not called at the end of
    target_tmr_work().
    
    It seems, that in other fabrics this call happens implicitly when the
    fabric drivers call transport_generic_free_cmd() during their
    ->queue_tm_rsp().
    
    Unfortunately Loopback seems to not comply to the common way
    of calling transport_generic_free_cmd() from ->queue_*().
    Instead it calls transport_generic_free_cmd() from its
      ->check_stop_free() only.
    
    But the ->check_stop_free() is called by
    transport_cmd_check_stop_to_fabric() after it has reset the se_cmd->se_lun
    pointer.  Therefore the following transport_generic_free_cmd() skips the
    transport_lun_remove_cmd().
    
    So this patch re-adds the transport_lun_remove_cmd() at the end of
    target_tmr_work(), which was removed during commit 2c9fa49e100f ("scsi:
    target/core: Make ABORT and LUN RESET handling synchronous").
    
    For fabrics using transport_generic_free_cmd() in the usual way the double
    call to transport_lun_remove_cmd() doesn't harm, as
    transport_lun_remove_cmd() checks for this situation and does not release
    lun_ref twice.

    commit fb9024b0646939e59d8a0b6799b317070619795a upstream.
    
    Calling ql_log() inside qla2x00_port_speed_show() is causing messages to be
    output to the console for no particularly good reason.  The sysfs read
    routine should just return the information to userspace.  The only reason
    to log a message is when the port speed actually changes, and this already
    occurs elsewhere.

    There is a corner case that ALSA keeps increasing the hw_ptr but DMA
    already stop working/updating the position for a long time.
    
    In following log we can see the position returned from DMA driver does
    not move at all but the hw_ptr got increased at some point of time so
    snd_pcm_avail() will return a large number which seems to be a buffer
    underrun event from user space program point of view. The program
    thinks there is space in the buffer and fill more data.

    This is because the hw_base will be increased by runtime->buffer_size
    frames unconditionally if the hw_ptr is not updated for over half of
    buffer time. As the hw_base increases, so does the hw_ptr increased
    by the same number.
    
    The avail value returned from snd_pcm_avail() could exceed the limit
    (buffer_size) easily becase the hw_ptr itself got increased by same
    buffer_size samples when the corner case happens. In following log,
    the buffer_size is 16368 samples but the avail is 21810 samples so
    CRAS server complains about it.

    cras_server[1907]: pcm_avail returned frames larger than buf_size:
    sof-glkda7219max: :0,5: 21810 > 16368
    
    By updating runtime->hw_ptr_jiffies each time the HWSYNC is called,
    the hw_base will keep the same when buffer stall happens at long as
    the interval between each HWSYNC call is shorter than half of buffer
    time.
    
    Following is a log captured by a patched kernel. The hw_base/hw_ptr
    value is fixed in this corner case and user space program should be
    aware of the buffer stall and handle it.

    KVM: x86: Fix pkru save/restore when guest CR4.PKE=0, move it to x86.c
    
    commit 37486135d3a7b03acc7755b63627a130437f066a upstream.
    
    Though rdpkru and wrpkru are contingent upon CR4.PKE, the PKRU
    resource isn't. It can be read with XSAVE and written with XRSTOR.
    So, if we don't set the guest PKRU value here(kvm_load_guest_xsave_state),
    the guest can read the host value.
    
    In case of kvm_load_host_xsave_state, guest with CR4.PKE clear could
    potentially use XRSTOR to change the host PKRU value.
    
    While at it, move pkru state save/restore to common code and the
    host_pkru field to kvm_vcpu_arch.  This will let SVM support protection keys.

    ALSA: hda: Manage concurrent reg access more properly
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a462be52f4505a2719631fb5aa7bfdbd37bfd8d ]
    
    In the commit 8e85def5723e ("ALSA: hda: enable regmap internal
    locking"), we re-enabled the regmap lock due to the reported
    regression that showed the possible concurrent accesses.  It was a
    temporary workaround, and there are still a few opened races even
    after the revert.  In this patch, we cover those still opened windows
    with a proper mutex lock and disable the regmap internal lock again.
    
    First off, the patch introduces a new snd_hdac_device.regmap_lock
    mutex that is applied for each snd_hdac_regmap_*() call, including
    read, write and update helpers.  The mutex is applied carefully so
    that it won't block the self-power-up procedure in the helper
    function.  Also, this assures the protection for the accesses without
    regmap, too.
    
    The snd_hdac_regmap_update_raw() is refactored to use the standard
    regmap_update_bits_check() function instead of the open-code.  The
    non-regmap case is still open-coded but it's an easy part.  The all
    read and write operations are in the single mutex protection, so it's
    now race-free.
    
    In addition, a couple of new helper functions are added:
    snd_hdac_regmap_update_raw_once() and snd_hdac_regmap_sync().  Both
    are called from HD-audio legacy driver.  The former is to initialize
    the given verb bits but only once when it's not initialized yet.  Due
    to this condition, the function invokes regcache_cache_only(), and
    it's now performed inside the regmap_lock (formerly it was racy) too.
    The latter function is for simply invoking regcache_sync() inside the
    regmap_lock, which is called from the codec resume call path.
    Along with that, the HD-audio codec driver code is slightly modified /
    simplified to adapt those new functions.
    
    And finally, snd_hdac_regmap_read_raw(), *_write_raw(), etc are
    rewritten with the helper macro.  It's just for simplification because
    the code logic is identical among all those functions.

    ARM: futex: Address build warning
    
    [ Upstream commit 8101b5a1531f3390b3a69fa7934c70a8fd6566ad ]
    
    Stephen reported the following build warning on a ARM multi_v7_defconfig
    build with GCC 9.2.1:
    
    kernel/futex.c: In function 'do_futex':
    kernel/futex.c:1676:17: warning: 'oldval' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
     1676 |   return oldval == cmparg;
          |          ~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~
    kernel/futex.c:1652:6: note: 'oldval' was declared here
     1652 |  int oldval, ret;
          |      ^~~~~~
    
    introduced by commit a08971e9488d ("futex: arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser()
    calling conventions change").
    
    While that change should not make any difference it confuses GCC which
    fails to work out that oldval is not referenced when the return value is
    not zero.
    
    GCC fails to properly analyze arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser(). It's not the
    early return, the issue is with the assembly macros. GCC fails to detect
    that those either set 'ret' to 0 and set oldval or set 'ret' to -EFAULT
    which makes oldval uninteresting. The store to the callsite supplied oldval
    pointer is conditional on ret == 0.
    
    The straight forward way to solve this is to make the store unconditional.
    
    Aside of addressing the build warning this makes sense anyway because it
    removes the conditional from the fastpath. In the error case the stored
    value is uninteresting and the extra store does not matter at all.

    KVM: selftests: Fix build for evmcs.h

    I think it's because evmcs.h is included both in a test file and a lib file so

    drm/amd/display: Prevent dpcd reads with passive dongles
    
    [ Upstream commit e6142dd511425cb827b5db869f489eb81f5f994d ]
    
    [why]
    During hotplug, a DP port may be connected to the sink through
    passive adapter which does not support DPCD reads. Issuing reads
    without checking for this condition will result in errors
    
    [how]
    Ensure the link is in aux_mode before initiating operation that result
    in a DPCD read.

    platform/x86: asus-nb-wmi: Do not load on Asus T100TA and T200TA
    
    [ Upstream commit 3bd12da7f50b8bc191fcb3bab1f55c582234df59 ]
    
    asus-nb-wmi does not add any extra functionality on these Asus
    Transformer books. They have detachable keyboards, so the hotkeys are
    send through a HID device (and handled by the hid-asus driver) and also
    the rfkill functionality is not used on these devices.
    
    Besides not adding any extra functionality, initializing the WMI interface
    on these devices actually has a negative side-effect. For some reason
    the \_SB.ATKD.INIT() function which asus_wmi_platform_init() calls drives
    GPO2 (INT33FC:02) pin 8, which is connected to the front facing webcam LED,
    high and there is no (WMI or other) interface to drive this low again
    causing the LED to be permanently on, even during suspend.
    
    This commit adds a blacklist of DMI system_ids on which not to load the
    asus-nb-wmi and adds these Transformer books to this list. This fixes
    the webcam LED being permanently on under Linux.

    USB: core: Fix misleading driver bug report
    
    [ Upstream commit ac854131d9844f79e2fdcef67a7707227538d78a ]
    
    The syzbot fuzzer found a race between URB submission to endpoint 0
    and device reset.  Namely, during the reset we call usb_ep0_reinit()
    because the characteristics of ep0 may have changed (if the reset
    follows a firmware update, for example).  While usb_ep0_reinit() is
    running there is a brief period during which the pointers stored in
    udev->ep_in[0] and udev->ep_out[0] are set to NULL, and if an URB is
    submitted to ep0 during that period, usb_urb_ep_type_check() will
    report it as a driver bug.  In the absence of those pointers, the
    routine thinks that the endpoint doesn't exist.  The log message looks
    like this:
    
    ------------[ cut here ]------------
    usb 2-1: BOGUS urb xfer, pipe 2 != type 2
    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9241 at drivers/usb/core/urb.c:478
    usb_submit_urb+0x1188/0x1460 drivers/usb/core/urb.c:478
    
    Now, although submitting an URB while the device is being reset is a
    questionable thing to do, it shouldn't count as a driver bug as severe
    as submitting an URB for an endpoint that doesn't exist.  Indeed,
    endpoint 0 always exists, even while the device is in its unconfigured
    state.
    
    To prevent these misleading driver bug reports, this patch updates
    usb_disable_endpoint() to avoid clearing the ep_in[] and ep_out[]
    pointers when the endpoint being disabled is ep0.  There's no danger
    of leaving a stale pointer in place, because the usb_host_endpoint
    structure being pointed to is stored permanently in udev->ep0; it
    doesn't get deallocated until the entire usb_device structure does.

    The paranoidal pointer check in IRQ handler looks very strange - it
    really protects us only against bogus drivers which request IRQ line
    with null pointer dev_id. However, the code fragment is incorrect
    because the dev pointer is used before the actual check which leads
    to undefined behavior. Remove the check to avoid confusing people
    with incorrect code.

    x86/apic: Move TSC deadline timer debug printk
    
    [ Upstream commit c84cb3735fd53c91101ccdb191f2e3331a9262cb ]
    
    Leon reported that the printk_once() in __setup_APIC_LVTT() triggers a
    lockdep splat due to a lock order violation between hrtimer_base::lock and
    console_sem, when the 'once' condition is reset via
    /sys/kernel/debug/clear_warn_once after boot.
    
    The initial printk cannot trigger this because that happens during boot
    when the local APIC timer is set up on the boot CPU.
    
    Prevent it by moving the printk to a place which is guaranteed to be only
    called once during boot.
    
    Mark the deadline timer check related functions and data __init while at
    it.

    ftracetest in line with unsupported cases; if unsupported cases
    happen, ftracetest still returns 0 unless --fail-unsupported.  Here
    --fail-unresolved is added and the default is to return 0 if
    unresolved results occur.

    ibmvnic: Skip fatal error reset after passive init
    
    [ Upstream commit f9c6cea0b38518741c8dcf26ac056d26ee2fd61d ]
    
    During MTU change, the following events may happen.
    Client-driven CRQ initialization fails due to partner’s CRQ closed,
    causing client to enqueue a reset task for FATAL_ERROR. Then passive
    (server-driven) CRQ initialization succeeds, causing client to
    release CRQ and enqueue a reset task for failover. If the passive
    CRQ initialization occurs before the FATAL reset task is processed,
    the FATAL error reset task would try to access a CRQ message queue
    that was freed, causing an oops. The problem may be most likely to
    occur during DLPAR add vNIC with a non-default MTU, because the DLPAR
    process will automatically issue a change MTU request.
    
    Fix this by not processing fatal error reset if CRQ is passively
    initialized after client-driven CRQ initialization fails.

    x86/mm/cpa: Flush direct map alias during cpa
    
    [ Upstream commit ab5130186d7476dcee0d4e787d19a521ca552ce9 ]
    
    As an optimization, cpa_flush() was changed to optionally only flush
    the range in @cpa if it was small enough.  However, this range does
    not include any direct map aliases changed in cpa_process_alias(). So
    small set_memory_() calls that touch that alias don't get the direct
    map changes flushed. This situation can happen when the virtual
    address taking variants are passed an address in vmalloc or modules
    space.
    
    In these cases, force a full TLB flush.
    
    Note this issue does not extend to cases where the set_memory_() calls are
    passed a direct map address, or page array, etc, as the primary target. In
    those cases the direct map would be flushed.

    configfs: fix config_item refcnt leak in configfs_rmdir()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8aebfffacfa379ba400da573a5bf9e49634e38cb ]
    
    configfs_rmdir() invokes configfs_get_config_item(), which returns a
    reference of the specified config_item object to "parent_item" with
    increased refcnt.
    
    When configfs_rmdir() returns, local variable "parent_item" becomes
    invalid, so the refcount should be decreased to keep refcount balanced.
    
    The reference counting issue happens in one exception handling path of
    configfs_rmdir(). When down_write_killable() fails, the function forgets
    to decrease the refcnt increased by configfs_get_config_item(), causing
    a refcnt leak.
    
    Fix this issue by calling config_item_put() when down_write_killable()
    fails.

    layer to decrement all active rport count down to zero.  Once the count is
    down to zero, nvme would call qla to continue with the npiv port deletion.

    scsi: qla2xxx: Fix hang when issuing nvme disconnect-all in NPIV
    
    [ Upstream commit 45a76264c26fd8cfd0c9746196892d9b7e2657ee ]
    
    In NPIV environment, a NPIV host may use a queue pair created by base host
    or other NPIVs, so the check for a queue pair created by this NPIV is not
    correct, and can cause an abort to fail, which in turn means the NVME
    command not returned.  This leads to hang in nvme_fc layer in
    nvme_fc_delete_association() which waits for all I/Os to be returned, which
    is seen as hang in the application.

    In net/Kconfig, NET_DEVLINK implies NET_DROP_MONITOR.
    
    The original behavior of the 'imply' keyword prevents NET_DROP_MONITOR
    from being 'm' when NET_DEVLINK=y.
    
    With the planned Kconfig change that relaxes the 'imply', the
    combination of NET_DEVLINK=y and NET_DROP_MONITOR=m would be allowed.
    
    Use IS_REACHABLE() to avoid the vmlinux link error for this case.

    kbuild: avoid concurrency issue in parallel building dtbs and dtbs_check
    
    [ Upstream commit b5154bf63e5577faaaca1d942df274f7de91dd2a ]
    
    'make dtbs_check' checks the shecma in addition to building *.dtb files,
    in other words, 'make dtbs_check' is a super-set of 'make dtbs'.
    So, you do not have to do 'make dtbs dtbs_check', but I want to keep
    the build system as robust as possible in any use.
    
    Currently, 'dtbs' and 'dtbs_check' are independent of each other.
    In parallel building, two threads descend into arch/*/boot/dts/,
    one for dtbs and the other for dtbs_check, then end up with building
    the same DTB simultaneously.
    
    This commit fixes the concurrency issue. Otherwise, I see build errors
    like follows:
    
    $ make ARCH=arm64 defconfig
    $ make -j16 ARCH=arm64 DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/psci.yaml dtbs dtbs_check

    mtd: Fix mtd not registered due to nvmem name collision
    
    [ Upstream commit 7b01b7239d0dc9832e0d0d23605c1ff047422a2c ]
    
    When the nvmem framework is enabled, a nvmem device is created per mtd
    device/partition.
    
    It is not uncommon that a device can have multiple mtd devices with
    partitions that have the same name. Eg, when there DT overlay is allowed
    and the same device with mtd is attached twice.
    
    Under that circumstances, the mtd fails to register due to a name
    duplication on the nvmem framework.
    
    With this patch we use the mtdX name instead of the partition name,
    which is unique.

    afs: Don't unlock fetched data pages until the op completes successfully
    
    [ Upstream commit 9d1be4f4dc5ff1c66c86acfd2c35765d9e3776b3 ]
    
    Don't call req->page_done() on each page as we finish filling it with
    the data coming from the network.  Whilst this might speed up the
    application a bit, it's a problem if there's a network failure and the
    operation has to be reissued.
    
    If this happens, an oops occurs because afs_readpages_page_done() clears
    the pointer to each page it unlocks and when a retry happens, the
    pointers to the pages it wants to fill are now NULL (and the pages have
    been unlocked anyway).
    
    Instead, wait till the operation completes successfully and only then
    release all the pages after clearing any terminal gap (the server can
    give us less data than we requested as we're allowed to ask for more
    than is available).
    
    KASAN produces a bug like the following, and even without KASAN, it can
    oops and panic.

    evm: Fix a small race in init_desc()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8433856947217ebb5697a8ff9c4c9cad4639a2cf ]
    
    The IS_ERR_OR_NULL() function has two conditions and if we got really
    unlucky we could hit a race where "ptr" started as an error pointer and
    then was set to NULL.  Both conditions would be false even though the
    pointer at the end was NULL.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by ensuring that "*tfm" can only be NULL
    or valid.  I have introduced a "tmp_tfm" variable to make that work.  I
    also reversed a condition and pulled the code in one tab.

    iommu/amd: Fix over-read of ACPI UID from IVRS table
    
    [ Upstream commit e461b8c991b9202b007ea2059d953e264240b0c9 ]
    
    IVRS parsing code always tries to read 255 bytes from memory when
    retrieving ACPI device path, and makes an assumption that firmware
    provides a zero-terminated string. Both of those are bugs: the entry
    is likely to be shorter than 255 bytes, and zero-termination is not
    guaranteed.
    
    With Acer SF314-42 firmware these issues manifest visibly in dmesg:
    
    AMD-Vi: ivrs, add hid:AMDI0020, uid:\_SB.FUR0\xf0\xa5, rdevid:160
    AMD-Vi: ivrs, add hid:AMDI0020, uid:\_SB.FUR1\xf0\xa5, rdevid:160
    AMD-Vi: ivrs, add hid:AMDI0020, uid:\_SB.FUR2\xf0\xa5, rdevid:160
    AMD-Vi: ivrs, add hid:AMDI0020, uid:\_SB.FUR3>\x83e\x8d\x9a\xd1...
    
    The first three lines show how the code over-reads adjacent table
    entries into the UID, and in the last line it even reads garbage data
    beyond the end of the IVRS table itself.
    
    Since each entry has the length of the UID (uidl member of ivhd_entry
    struct), use that for memcpy, and manually add a zero terminator.
    
    Avoid zero-filling hid and uid arrays up front, and instead ensure
    the uid array is always zero-terminated. No change needed for the hid
    array, as it was already properly zero-terminated.

    When "ubifs: introduce UBIFS_ATIME_SUPPORT to ubifs" introduced atime
    support to ubifs, it also added lazytime support.  As far as I can tell
    the lazytime support is terminally broken, as it causes
    mark_inode_dirty_sync to be called from __writeback_single_inode, which
    will then trigger the locking assert in ubifs_dirty_inode.  Just remove
    the broken lazytime support for now, it can be added back later,
    especially as some infrastructure changes should make that easier soon.

    ACPI: EC: PM: Avoid flushing EC work when EC GPE is inactive
    
    [ Upstream commit 607b9df63057a56f6172d560d5366cca6a030c76 ]
    
    Flushing the EC work while suspended to idle when the EC GPE status
    is not set causes some EC wakeup events (notably power button and
    lid ones) to be missed after a series of spurious wakeups on the Dell
    XPS13 9360 in my office.
    
    If that happens, the machine cannot be woken up from suspend-to-idle
    by the power button or lid status change and it needs to be woken up
    in some other way (eg. by a key press).
    
    Flushing the EC work only after successful dispatching the EC GPE,
    which means that its status has been set, avoids the issue, so change
    the code in question accordingly.

    Task A: *tfm = crypto_alloc_shash() <= error pointer
    Task B: if (*tfm == NULL) <= *tfm is not NULL, use it
    Task B: rc = crypto_shash_init(desc) <= panic
    Task A: *tfm = NULL
    
    This patch uses the IS_ERR_OR_NULL macro to determine whether or not a new
    crypto context must be created.

    ima: Set file->f_mode instead of file->f_flags in ima_calc_file_hash()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0014cc04e8ec077dc482f00c87dfd949cfe2b98f ]
    
    Commit a408e4a86b36 ("ima: open a new file instance if no read
    permissions") tries to create a new file descriptor to calculate a file
    digest if the file has not been opened with O_RDONLY flag. However, if a
    new file descriptor cannot be obtained, it sets the FMODE_READ flag to
    file->f_flags instead of file->f_mode.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by replacing f_flags with f_mode as it was
    before that commit.

    KVM: SVM: Fix potential memory leak in svm_cpu_init()
    
    commit d80b64ff297e40c2b6f7d7abc1b3eba70d22a068 upstream.
    
    When kmalloc memory for sd->sev_vmcbs failed, we forget to free the page
    held by sd->save_area. Also get rid of the var r as '-ENOMEM' is actually
    the only possible outcome here.

    i2c: dev: Fix the race between the release of i2c_dev and cdev
    
    commit 1413ef638abae4ab5621901cf4d8ef08a4a48ba6 upstream.
    
    The struct cdev is embedded in the struct i2c_dev. In the current code,
    we would free the i2c_dev struct directly in put_i2c_dev(), but the
    cdev is manged by a kobject, and the release of it is not predictable.
    So it is very possible that the i2c_dev is freed before the cdev is
    entirely released. We can easily get the following call trace with
    CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE and CONFIG_DEBUG_OBJECTS_TIMERS enabled.

    This is a common issue when using cdev embedded in a struct.
    Fortunately, we already have a mechanism to solve this kind of issue.
    Please see commit 233ed09d7fda ("chardev: add helper function to
    register char devs with a struct device") for more detail.
    
    In this patch, we choose to embed the struct device into the i2c_dev,
    and use the API provided by the commit 233ed09d7fda to make sure that
    the release of i2c_dev and cdev are in sequence.
