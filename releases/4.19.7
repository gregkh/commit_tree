    Drivers: hv: vmbus: check the creation_status in vmbus_establish_gpadl()
    
    commit eceb05965489784f24bbf4d61ba60e475a983016 upstream.
    
    This is a longstanding issue: if the vmbus upper-layer drivers try to
    consume too many GPADLs, the host may return with an error
    0xC0000044 (STATUS_QUOTA_EXCEEDED), but currently we forget to check
    the creation_status, and hence we can pass an invalid GPADL handle
    into the OPEN_CHANNEL message, and get an error code 0xc0000225 in
    open_info->response.open_result.status, and finally we hang in
    vmbus_open() -> "goto error_free_info" -> vmbus_teardown_gpadl().
    
    With this patch, we can exit gracefully on STATUS_QUOTA_EXCEEDED.

    mm: use swp_offset as key in shmem_replace_page()
    
    commit c1cb20d43728aa9b5393bd8d489bc85c142949b2 upstream.
    
    We changed the key of swap cache tree from swp_entry_t.val to
    swp_offset.  We need to do so in shmem_replace_page() as well.
    
    Hugh said:
     "shmem_replace_page() has been wrong since the day I wrote it: good
      enough to work on swap "type" 0, which is all most people ever use
      (especially those few who need shmem_replace_page() at all), but
      broken once there are any non-0 swp_type bits set in the higher order

    mm: cleancache: fix corruption on missed inode invalidation
    
    commit 6ff38bd40230af35e446239396e5fc8ebd6a5248 upstream.
    
    If all pages are deleted from the mapping by memory reclaim and also
    moved to the cleancache:
    
    __delete_from_page_cache
      (no shadow case)
      unaccount_page_cache_page
        cleancache_put_page
      page_cache_delete
        mapping->nrpages -= nr
        (nrpages becomes 0)
    
    We don't clean the cleancache for an inode after final file truncation
    (removal).
    
    truncate_inode_pages_final
      check (nrpages || nrexceptional) is false
        no truncate_inode_pages
          no cleancache_invalidate_inode(mapping)
    
    These way when reading the new file created with same inode we may get
    these trash leftover pages from cleancache and see wrong data instead of
    the contents of the new file.
    
    Fix it by always doing truncate_inode_pages which is already ready for
    nrpages == 0 && nrexceptional == 0 case and just invalidates inode.

    iio:st_magn: Fix enable device after trigger
    
    commit fe5192ac81ad0d4dfe1395d11f393f0513c15f7f upstream.
    
    Currently, we enable the device before we enable the device trigger. At
    high frequencies, this can cause interrupts that don't yet have a poll
    function associated with them and are thus treated as spurious. At high
    frequencies with level interrupts, this can even cause an interrupt storm
    of repeated spurious interrupts (~100,000 on my Beagleboard with the
    LSM9DS1 magnetometer). If these repeat too much, the interrupt will get
    disabled and the device will stop functioning.
    
    To prevent these problems, enable the device prior to enabling the device
    trigger, and disable the divec prior to disabling the trigger. This means
    there's no window of time during which the device creates interrupts but we
    have no trigger to answer them.

    iio/hid-sensors: Fix IIO_CHAN_INFO_RAW returning wrong values for signed numbers
    
    commit 0145b50566e7de5637e80ecba96c7f0e6fff1aad upstream.
    
    Before this commit sensor_hub_input_attr_get_raw_value() failed to take
    the signedness of 16 and 8 bit values into account, returning e.g.
    65436 instead of -100 for the z-axis reading of an accelerometer.
    
    This commit adds a new is_signed parameter to the function and makes all
    callers pass the appropriate value for this.
    
    While at it, this commit also fixes up some neighboring lines where
    statements were needlessly split over 2 lines to improve readability.

    This missing bit is apparently not needed with NetworkManager, but it
    does no harm in that case.

    In commit b37f9e1c3801 ("staging: rtl8723bs: Fix lines too long in
    update_recvframe_attrib()."), the refactoring involved replacing
    two memcmp() calls with ether_addr_equal() calls. What the author
    missed is that memcmp() returns false when the two strings are equal,
    whereas ether_addr_equal() returns true when the two addresses are
    equal. One side effect of this error is that the strength of an
    unassociated AP was much stronger than the same AP after association.
    This bug is reported at bko#201611.

    staging: vchiq_arm: fix compat VCHIQ_IOC_AWAIT_COMPLETION
    
    commit 5a96b2d38dc054c0bbcbcd585b116566cbd877fe upstream.
    
    The compatibility ioctl wrapper for VCHIQ_IOC_AWAIT_COMPLETION assumes that
    the native ioctl always uses a message buffer and decrements msgbufcount.
    Certain message types do not use a message buffer and in this case
    msgbufcount is not decremented, and completion->header for the message is
    NULL. Because the wrapper unconditionally decrements msgbufcount, the
    calling process may assume that a message buffer has been used even when
    it has not.
    
    This results in a memory leak in the userspace code that interfaces with
    this driver. When msgbufcount is decremented, the userspace code assumes
    that the buffer can be freed though the reference in completion->header,
    which cannot happen when the reference is NULL.
    
    This patch causes the wrapper to only decrement msgbufcount when the
    native ioctl decrements it. Note that we cannot simply copy the native
    ioctl's value of msgbufcount, because the wrapper only retrieves messages
    from the native ioctl one at a time, while userspace may request multiple
    messages.
    
    See https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/pull/2703 for more discussion of
    this patch.

    commit 98f5f932254b88ce828bc8e4d1642d14e5854caa upstream.
    
    The leak was found when opening/closing a serial port a great number of
    time, increasing kmalloc-32 in slabinfo.
    
    Each time the port was opened, dma_request_slave_channel() was called.
    Then, in at_dma_xlate(), atslave was allocated with devm_kzalloc() and
    never freed. (Well, it was free at module unload, but that's not what we
    want).
    So, here, kzalloc is more suited for the job since it has to be freed in
    atc_free_chan_resources().

    ARM: dts: rockchip: Remove @0 from the veyron memory node
    
    commit 672e60b72bbe7aace88721db55b380b6a51fb8f9 upstream.
    
    The Coreboot version on veyron ChromeOS devices seems to ignore
    memory@0 nodes when updating the available memory and instead
    inserts another memory node without the address.
    
    This leads to 4GB systems only ever be using 2GB as the memory@0
    node takes precedence. So remove the @0 for veyron devices.

    commit a182ecd3809c8d5a2da80c520f3602e301c5317e upstream.
    
    Some boards such as the Swanky model Chromebooks use pmc_plt_clk_0 for the
    mclk instead of pmc_plt_clk_3.
    
    This commit adds a DMI based quirk for this.
    
    This fixing audio no longer working on these devices after
    commit 648e921888ad ("clk: x86: Stop marking clocks as CLK_IS_CRITICAL")
    that commit fixes us unnecessary keeping unused clocks on, but in case
    of the Swanky that was breaking audio support since we were not using
    the right clock in the cht_bsw_max98090_ti machine driver.

    ext2: fix potential use after free
    
    commit ecebf55d27a11538ea84aee0be643dd953f830d5 upstream.
    
    The function ext2_xattr_set calls brelse(bh) to drop the reference count
    of bh. After that, bh may be freed. However, following brelse(bh),
    it reads bh->b_data via macro HDR(bh). This may result in a
    use-after-free bug. This patch moves brelse(bh) after reading field.

    binder: fix race that allows malicious free of live buffer
    
    commit 7bada55ab50697861eee6bb7d60b41e68a961a9c upstream.
    
    Malicious code can attempt to free buffers using the BC_FREE_BUFFER
    ioctl to binder. There are protections against a user freeing a buffer
    while in use by the kernel, however there was a window where
    BC_FREE_BUFFER could be used to free a recently allocated buffer that
    was not completely initialized. This resulted in a use-after-free
    detected by KASAN with a malicious test program.
    
    This window is closed by setting the buffer's allow_user_free attribute
    to 0 when the buffer is allocated or when the user has previously freed
    it instead of waiting for the caller to set it. The problem was that
    when the struct buffer was recycled, allow_user_free was stale and set
    to 1 allowing a free to go through.

    function_graph: Reverse the order of pushing the ret_stack and the callback
    
    commit 7c6ea35ef50810aa12ab26f21cb858d980881576 upstream.
    
    The function graph profiler uses the ret_stack to store the "subtime" and
    reuse it by nested functions and also on the return. But the current logic
    has the profiler callback called before the ret_stack is updated, and it is
    just modifying the ret_stack that will later be allocated (it's just lucky
    that the "subtime" is not touched when it is allocated).
    
    This could also cause a crash if we are at the end of the ret_stack when
    this happens.
    
    By reversing the order of the allocating the ret_stack and then calling the
    callbacks attached to a function being traced, the ret_stack entry is no
    longer used before it is allocated.

    function_graph: Move return callback before update of curr_ret_stack
    
    commit 552701dd0fa7c3d448142e87210590ba424694a0 upstream.
    
    In the past, curr_ret_stack had two functions. One was to denote the depth
    of the call graph, the other is to keep track of where on the ret_stack the
    data is used. Although they may be slightly related, there are two cases
    where they need to be used differently.
    
    The one case is that it keeps the ret_stack data from being corrupted by an
    interrupt coming in and overwriting the data still in use. The other is just
    to know where the depth of the stack currently is.
    
    The function profiler uses the ret_stack to save a "subtime" variable that
    is part of the data on the ret_stack. If curr_ret_stack is modified too
    early, then this variable can be corrupted.
    
    The "max_depth" option, when set to 1, will record the first functions going
    into the kernel. To see all top functions (when dealing with timings), the
    depth variable needs to be lowered before calling the return hook. But by
    lowering the curr_ret_stack, it makes the data on the ret_stack still being
    used by the return hook susceptible to being overwritten.
    
    Now that there's two variables to handle both cases (curr_ret_depth), we can
    move them to the locations where they can handle both cases.

    function_graph: Have profiler use curr_ret_stack and not depth
    
    commit b1b35f2e218a5b57d03bbc3b0667d5064570dc60 upstream.
    
    The profiler uses trace->depth to find its entry on the ret_stack, but the
    depth may not match the actual location of where its entry is (if an
    interrupt were to preempt the processing of the profiler for another
    function, the depth and the curr_ret_stack will be different).
    
    Have it use the curr_ret_stack as the index to find its ret_stack entry
    instead of using the depth variable, as that is no longer guaranteed to be
    the same.

    function_graph: Use new curr_ret_depth to manage depth instead of curr_ret_stack
    
    commit 39eb456dacb543de90d3bc6a8e0ac5cf51ac475e upstream.
    
    Currently, the depth of the ret_stack is determined by curr_ret_stack index.
    The issue is that there's a race between setting of the curr_ret_stack and
    calling of the callback attached to the return of the function.
    
    Commit 03274a3ffb44 ("tracing/fgraph: Adjust fgraph depth before calling
    trace return callback") moved the calling of the callback to after the
    setting of the curr_ret_stack, even stating that it was safe to do so, when
    in fact, it was the reason there was a barrier() there (yes, I should have
    commented that barrier()).
    
    Not only does the curr_ret_stack keep track of the current call graph depth,
    it also keeps the ret_stack content from being overwritten by new data.
    
    The function profiler, uses the "subtime" variable of ret_stack structure
    and by moving the curr_ret_stack, it allows for interrupts to use the same
    structure it was using, corrupting the data, and breaking the profiler.
    
    To fix this, there needs to be two variables to handle the call stack depth
    and the pointer to where the ret_stack is being used, as they need to change
    at two different locations.

    commit 9c4bf5e0db164f330a2d3e128e9832661f69f0e9 upstream.
    
    The function_graph_enter() function does the work of calling the function
    graph hook function and the management of the shadow stack, simplifying the
    work done in the architecture dependent prepare_ftrace_return().
    
    Have sparc use the new code, and remove the shadow stack management as well as
    having to set up the trace structure.
    
    This is needed to prepare for a fix of a design bug on how the curr_ret_stack
    is used.

    function_graph: Create function_graph_enter() to consolidate architecture code
    
    commit 8114865ff82e200b383e46821c25cb0625b842b5 upstream.
    
    Currently all the architectures do basically the same thing in preparing the
    function graph tracer on entry to a function. This code can be pulled into a
    generic location and then this will allow the function graph tracer to be
    fixed, as well as extended.
    
    Create a new function graph helper function_graph_enter() that will call the
    hook function (ftrace_graph_entry) and the shadow stack operation
    (ftrace_push_return_trace), and remove the need of the architecture code to
    manage the shadow stack.
    
    This is needed to prepare for a fix of a design bug on how the curr_ret_stack
    is used.

    We have several Lenovo laptops with the codec alc285, when playing
    sound via headphone, we can hear click/pop noise in the headphone,
    if we let the headphone share the DAC of NID 0x2 with the speaker,
    the noise disappears.
    
    The Lenovo laptops here include P52, P72, X1 yoda2 and X1 carbon.
    
    I have tried to set preferred_dacs and override_conn, but neither of
    them worked. Thanks for Kailang, he told me to invalidate the NID 0x3
    through override_wcaps.

    ALSA: control: Fix race between adding and removing a user element
    
    commit e1a7bfe3807974e66f971f2589d4e0197ec0fced upstream.
    
    The procedure for adding a user control element has some window opened
    for race against the concurrent removal of a user element.  This was
    caught by syzkaller, hitting a KASAN use-after-free error.
    
    This patch addresses the bug by wrapping the whole procedure to add a
    user control element with the card->controls_rwsem, instead of only
    around the increment of card->user_ctl_count.
    
    This required a slight code refactoring, too.  The function
    snd_ctl_add() is split to two parts: a core function to add the
    control element and a part calling it.  The former is called from the
    function for adding a user control element inside the controls_rwsem.
    
    One change to be noted is that snd_ctl_notify() for adding a control
    element gets called inside the controls_rwsem as well while it was
    called outside the rwsem.  But this should be OK, as snd_ctl_notify()
    takes another (finer) rwlock instead of rwsem, and the call of
    snd_ctl_notify() inside rwsem is already done in another code path.

    ALSA: ac97: Fix incorrect bit shift at AC97-SPSA control write
    
    commit 7194eda1ba0872d917faf3b322540b4f57f11ba5 upstream.
    
    The function snd_ac97_put_spsa() gets the bit shift value from the
    associated private_value, but it extracts too much; the current code
    extracts 8 bit values in bits 8-15, but this is a combination of two
    nibbles (bits 8-11 and bits 12-15) for left and right shifts.
    Due to the incorrect bits extraction, the actual shift may go beyond
    the 32bit value, as spotted recently by UBSAN check:
     UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in sound/pci/ac97/ac97_codec.c:836:7
     shift exponent 68 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'
    
    This patch fixes the shift value extraction by masking the properly
    with 0x0f instead of 0xff.

    fs: fix lost error code in dio_complete
    
    commit 41e817bca3acd3980efe5dd7d28af0e6f4ab9247 upstream.
    
    commit e259221763a40403d5bb232209998e8c45804ab8 ("fs: simplify the
    generic_write_sync prototype") reworked callers of generic_write_sync(),
    and ended up dropping the error return for the directio path. Prior to
    that commit, in dio_complete(), an error would be bubbled up the stack,
    but after that commit, errors passed on to dio_complete were eaten up.
    
    This was reported on the list earlier, and a fix was proposed in
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20160921141539.GA17898@infradead.org/, but
    never followed up with.  We recently hit this bug in our testing where
    fencing io errors, which were previously erroring out with EIO, were
    being returned as success operations after this commit.
    
    The fix proposed on the list earlier was a little short -- it would have
    still called generic_write_sync() in case `ret` already contained an
    error. This fix ensures generic_write_sync() is only called when there's
    no pending error in the write. Additionally, transferred is replaced
    with ret to bring this code in line with other callers.

    commit 472de49fdc53365c880ab81ae2b5cfdd83db0b06 upstream.
    
    Vince reported a crash in the BTS flush code when touching the callchain
    data, which was supposed to be initialized as an 'early' callchain,
    but intel_pmu_drain_bts_buffer() does not do that:
    
      BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000000

    It was triggered by fuzzer but can be easily reproduced by:

    Peter suggested not to allow branch tracing for precise events:

     > So in my mind disallowing precise_ip on BTS would be the simplest fix.

    perf/x86/intel: Add generic branch tracing check to intel_pmu_has_bts()
    
    commit 67266c1080ad56c31af72b9c18355fde8ccc124a upstream.
    
    Currently we check the branch tracing only by checking for the
    PERF_COUNT_HW_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS event of PERF_TYPE_HARDWARE
    type. But we can define the same event with the PERF_TYPE_RAW
    type.
    
    Changing the intel_pmu_has_bts() code to check on event's final
    hw config value, so both HW types are covered.
    
    Adding unlikely to intel_pmu_has_bts() condition calls, because
    it was used in the original code in intel_bts_constraints.

    x86/fpu: Disable bottom halves while loading FPU registers
    
    commit 68239654acafe6aad5a3c1dc7237e60accfebc03 upstream.
    
    The sequence
    
      fpu->initialized = 1;         /* step A */
      preempt_disable();            /* step B */
      fpu__restore(fpu);
      preempt_enable();
    
    in __fpu__restore_sig() is racy in regard to a context switch.
    
    For 32bit frames, __fpu__restore_sig() prepares the FPU state within
    fpu->state. To ensure that a context switch (switch_fpu_prepare() in
    particular) does not modify fpu->state it uses fpu__drop() which sets
    fpu->initialized to 0.
    
    After fpu->initialized is cleared, the CPU's FPU state is not saved
    to fpu->state during a context switch. The new state is loaded via
    fpu__restore(). It gets loaded into fpu->state from userland and
    ensured it is sane. fpu->initialized is then set to 1 in order to avoid
    fpu__initialize() doing anything (overwrite the new state) which is part
    of fpu__restore().
    
    A context switch between step A and B above would save CPU's current FPU
    registers to fpu->state and overwrite the newly prepared state. This
    looks like a tiny race window but the Kernel Test Robot reported this
    back in 2016 while we had lazy FPU support. Borislav Petkov made the
    link between that report and another patch that has been posted. Since
    the removal of the lazy FPU support, this race goes unnoticed because
    the warning has been removed.
    
    Disable bottom halves around the restore sequence to avoid the race. BH
    need to be disabled because BH is allowed to run (even with preemption
    disabled) and might invoke kernel_fpu_begin() by doing IPsec.

    x86/MCE/AMD: Fix the thresholding machinery initialization order
    
    commit 60c8144afc287ef09ce8c1230c6aa972659ba1bb upstream.
    
    Currently, the code sets up the thresholding interrupt vector and only
    then goes about initializing the thresholding banks. Which is wrong,
    because an early thresholding interrupt would cause a NULL pointer
    dereference when accessing those banks and prevent the machine from
    booting.
    
    Therefore, set the thresholding interrupt vector only *after* having
    initialized the banks successfully.

    PCI: Fix incorrect value returned from pcie_get_speed_cap()
    
    commit f1f90e254e46e0a14220e4090041f68256fbe297 upstream.
    
    The macros PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_SLS_*GB are values, not bit masks.  We must mask
    the register and compare it against them.
    
    This fixes errors like this:
    
      amdgpu: [powerplay] failed to send message 261 ret is 0
    
    when a PCIe-v3 card is plugged into a PCIe-v1 slot, because the slot is
    being incorrectly reported as PCIe-v3 capable.
    
    6cf57be0f78e, which appeared in v4.17, added pcie_get_speed_cap() with the
    incorrect test of PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_SLS as a bitmask.  5d9a63304032, which
    appeared in v4.19, changed amdgpu to use pcie_get_speed_cap(), so the
    amdgpu bug reports below are regressions in v4.19.

    The function relocate_block_group calls btrfs_end_transaction to release
    trans when update_backref_cache returns 1, and then continues the loop
    body. If btrfs_block_rsv_refill fails this time, it will jump out the
    loop and the freed trans will be accessed. This may result in a
    use-after-free bug. The patch assigns NULL to trans after trans is
    released so that it will not be accessed.

    Returning -EINVAL to user space will be confusing if all the arguments
    passed to the subvolume creation ioctl were valid.
    
    Fix it by grabbing the value from fs_info->quota_root after acquiring
    the mutex.

    Btrfs: fix rare chances for data loss when doing a fast fsync
    
    commit aab15e8ec25765cf7968c72cbec7583acf99d8a4 upstream.
    
    After the simplification of the fast fsync patch done recently by commit
    b5e6c3e170b7 ("btrfs: always wait on ordered extents at fsync time") and
    commit e7175a692765 ("btrfs: remove the wait ordered logic in the
    log_one_extent path"), we got a very short time window where we can get
    extents logged without writeback completing first or extents logged
    without logging the respective data checksums. Both issues can only happen
    when doing a non-full (fast) fsync.
    
    As soon as we enter btrfs_sync_file() we trigger writeback, then lock the
    inode and then wait for the writeback to complete before starting to log
    the inode. However before we acquire the inode's lock and after we started
    writeback, it's possible that more writes happened and dirtied more pages.
    If that happened and those pages get writeback triggered while we are
    logging the inode (for example, the VM subsystem triggering it due to
    memory pressure, or another concurrent fsync), we end up seeing the
    respective extent maps in the inode's list of modified extents and will
    log matching file extent items without waiting for the respective
    ordered extents to complete, meaning that either of the following will
    happen:
    
    1) We log an extent after its writeback finishes but before its checksums
       are added to the csum tree, leading to -EIO errors when attempting to
       read the extent after a log replay.
    
    2) We log an extent before its writeback finishes.
       Therefore after the log replay we will have a file extent item pointing
       to an unwritten extent (and without the respective data checksums as
       well).
    
    This could not happen before the fast fsync patch simplification, because
    for any extent we found in the list of modified extents, we would wait for
    its respective ordered extent to finish writeback or collect its checksums
    for logging if it did not complete yet.
    
    Fix this by triggering writeback again after acquiring the inode's lock
    and before waiting for ordered extents to complete.

    Btrfs: ensure path name is null terminated at btrfs_control_ioctl
    
    commit f505754fd6599230371cb01b9332754ddc104be1 upstream.
    
    We were using the path name received from user space without checking that
    it is null terminated. While btrfs-progs is well behaved and does proper
    validation and null termination, someone could call the ioctl and pass
    a non-null terminated patch, leading to buffer overrun problems in the
    kernel.  The ioctl is protected by CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
    
    So just set the last byte of the path to a null character, similar to what
    we do in other ioctls (add/remove/resize device, snapshot creation, etc).

    btrfs: Always try all copies when reading extent buffers
    
    commit f8397d69daef06d358430d3054662fb597e37c00 upstream.
    
    When a metadata read is served the endio routine btree_readpage_end_io_hook
    is called which eventually runs the tree-checker. If tree-checker fails
    to validate the read eb then it sets EXTENT_BUFFER_CORRUPT flag. This
    leads to btree_read_extent_buffer_pages wrongly assuming that all
    available copies of this extent buffer are wrong and failing prematurely.
    Fix this modify btree_read_extent_buffer_pages to read all copies of
    the data.
    
    This failure was exhibitted in xfstests btrfs/124 which would
    spuriously fail its balance operations. The reason was that when balance
    was run following re-introduction of the missing raid1 disk
    __btrfs_map_block would map the read request to stripe 0, which
    corresponded to devid 2 (the disk which is being removed in the test):
    
        item 2 key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 3553624064) itemoff 15975 itemsize 112
            length 1073741824 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type DATA|RAID1
            io_align 65536 io_width 65536 sector_size 4096
            num_stripes 2 sub_stripes 1
                    stripe 0 devid 2 offset 2156920832
                    dev_uuid 8466c350-ed0c-4c3b-b17d-6379b445d5c8
                    stripe 1 devid 1 offset 3553624064
                    dev_uuid 1265d8db-5596-477e-af03-df08eb38d2ca
    
    This caused read requests for a checksum item that to be routed to the
    stale disk which triggered the aforementioned logic involving
    EXTENT_BUFFER_CORRUPT flag. This then triggered cascading failures of
    the balance operation.

    udf: Allow mounting volumes with incorrect identification strings
    
    commit b54e41f5efcb4316b2f30b30c2535cc194270373 upstream.
    
    Commit c26f6c615788 ("udf: Fix conversion of 'dstring' fields to UTF8")
    started to be more strict when checking whether converted strings are
    properly formatted. Sudip reports that there are DVDs where the volume
    identification string is actually too long - UDF reports:
    
    [  632.309320] UDF-fs: incorrect dstring lengths (32/32)
    
    during mount and fails the mount. This is mostly harmless failure as we
    don't need volume identification (and even less volume set
    identification) for anything. So just truncate the volume identification
    string if it is too long and replace it with 'Invalid' if we just cannot
    convert it for other reasons. This keeps slightly incorrect media still
    mountable.

    xtensa: fix coprocessor part of ptrace_{get,set}xregs
    
    commit 38a35a78c5e270cbe53c4fef6b0d3c2da90dd849 upstream.
    
    Layout of coprocessor registers in the elf_xtregs_t and
    xtregs_coprocessor_t may be different due to alignment. Thus it is not
    always possible to copy data between the xtregs_coprocessor_t structure
    and the elf_xtregs_t and get correct values for all registers.
    Use a table of offsets and sizes of individual coprocessor register
    groups to do coprocessor context copying in the ptrace_getxregs and
    ptrace_setxregs.
    This fixes incorrect coprocessor register values reading from the user
    process by the native gdb on an xtensa core with multiple coprocessors
    and registers with high alignment requirements.

    commit 03bc996af0cc71c7f30c384d8ce7260172423b34 upstream.
    
    Coprocessor context offsets are used by the assembly code that moves
    coprocessor context between the individual fields of the
    thread_info::xtregs_cp structure and coprocessor registers.
    This fixes coprocessor context clobbering on flushing and reloading
    during normal user code execution and user process debugging in the
    presence of more than one coprocessor in the core configuration.

    xtensa: enable coprocessors that are being flushed
    
    commit 2958b66694e018c552be0b60521fec27e8d12988 upstream.
    
    coprocessor_flush_all may be called from a context of a thread that is
    different from the thread being flushed. In that case contents of the
    cpenable special register may not match ti->cpenable of the target
    thread, resulting in unhandled coprocessor exception in the kernel
    context.
    Set cpenable special register to the ti->cpenable of the target register
    for the duration of the flush and restore it afterwards.
    This fixes the following crash caused by coprocessor register inspection
    in native gdb:

    KVM: x86: Fix kernel info-leak in KVM_HC_CLOCK_PAIRING hypercall
    
    commit bcbfbd8ec21096027f1ee13ce6c185e8175166f6 upstream.
    
    kvm_pv_clock_pairing() allocates local var
    "struct kvm_clock_pairing clock_pairing" on stack and initializes
    all it's fields besides padding (clock_pairing.pad[]).
    
    Because clock_pairing var is written completely (including padding)
    to guest memory, failure to init struct padding results in kernel
    info-leak.
    
    Fix the issue by making sure to also init the padding with zeroes.

    KVM: nVMX/nSVM: Fix bug which sets vcpu->arch.tsc_offset to L1 tsc_offset
    
    commit 326e742533bf0a23f0127d8ea62fb558ba665f08 upstream.
    
    Since commit e79f245ddec1 ("X86/KVM: Properly update 'tsc_offset' to
    represent the running guest"), vcpu->arch.tsc_offset meaning was
    changed to always reflect the tsc_offset value set on active VMCS.
    Regardless if vCPU is currently running L1 or L2.
    
    However, above mentioned commit failed to also change
    kvm_vcpu_write_tsc_offset() to set vcpu->arch.tsc_offset correctly.
    This is because vmx_write_tsc_offset() could set the tsc_offset value
    in active VMCS to given offset parameter *plus vmcs12->tsc_offset*.
    However, kvm_vcpu_write_tsc_offset() just sets vcpu->arch.tsc_offset
    to given offset parameter. Without taking into account the possible
    addition of vmcs12->tsc_offset. (Same is true for SVM case).
    
    Fix this issue by changing kvm_x86_ops->write_tsc_offset() to return
    actually set tsc_offset in active VMCS and modify
    kvm_vcpu_write_tsc_offset() to set returned value in
    vcpu->arch.tsc_offset.
    In addition, rename write_tsc_offset() callback to write_l1_tsc_offset()
    to make it clear that it is meant to set L1 TSC offset.

    kvm: mmu: Fix race in emulated page table writes
    
    commit 0e0fee5c539b61fdd098332e0e2cc375d9073706 upstream.
    
    When a guest page table is updated via an emulated write,
    kvm_mmu_pte_write() is called to update the shadow PTE using the just
    written guest PTE value. But if two emulated guest PTE writes happened
    concurrently, it is possible that the guest PTE and the shadow PTE end
    up being out of sync. Emulated writes do not mark the shadow page as
    unsync-ed, so this inconsistency will not be resolved even by a guest TLB
    flush (unless the page was marked as unsync-ed at some other point).
    
    This is fixed by re-reading the current value of the guest PTE after the
    MMU lock has been acquired instead of just using the value that was
    written prior to calling kvm_mmu_pte_write().

    x86/speculation: Add seccomp Spectre v2 user space protection mode
    
    commit 6b3e64c237c072797a9ec918654a60e3a46488e2 upstream
    
    If 'prctl' mode of user space protection from spectre v2 is selected
    on the kernel command-line, STIBP and IBPB are applied on tasks which
    restrict their indirect branch speculation via prctl.
    
    SECCOMP enables the SSBD mitigation for sandboxed tasks already, so it
    makes sense to prevent spectre v2 user space to user space attacks as
    well.
    
    The Intel mitigation guide documents how STIPB works:
    
       Setting bit 1 (STIBP) of the IA32_SPEC_CTRL MSR on a logical processor
       prevents the predicted targets of indirect branches on any logical
       processor of that core from being controlled by software that executes
       (or executed previously) on another logical processor of the same core.
    
    Ergo setting STIBP protects the task itself from being attacked from a task
    running on a different hyper-thread and protects the tasks running on
    different hyper-threads from being attacked.
    
    While the document suggests that the branch predictors are shielded between
    the logical processors, the observed performance regressions suggest that
    STIBP simply disables the branch predictor more or less completely. Of
    course the document wording is vague, but the fact that there is also no
    requirement for issuing IBPB when STIBP is used points clearly in that
    direction. The kernel still issues IBPB even when STIBP is used until Intel
    clarifies the whole mechanism.
    
    IBPB is issued when the task switches out, so malicious sandbox code cannot
    mistrain the branch predictor for the next user space task on the same
    logical processor.

    x86/speculation: Prevent stale SPEC_CTRL msr content
    
    commit 6d991ba509ebcfcc908e009d1db51972a4f7a064 upstream
    
    The seccomp speculation control operates on all tasks of a process, but
    only the current task of a process can update the MSR immediately. For the
    other threads the update is deferred to the next context switch.
    
    This creates the following situation with Process A and B:
    
    Process A task 2 and Process B task 1 are pinned on CPU1. Process A task 2
    does not have the speculation control TIF bit set. Process B task 1 has the
    speculation control TIF bit set.

                                            MSR bit is set
                                            ProcB.T1 schedules out

                                            MSR bit is cleared
    ProcA.T1
      seccomp_update()
      set TIF bit on ProcA.T2
                                            ProcB.T1 schedules in
                                            MSR is not updated  <-- FAIL
    
    This happens because the context switch code tries to avoid the MSR update
    if the speculation control TIF bits of the incoming and the outgoing task
    are the same. In the worst case ProcB.T1 and ProcA.T2 are the only tasks
    scheduling back and forth on CPU1, which keeps the MSR stale forever.
    
    In theory this could be remedied by IPIs, but chasing the remote task which
    could be migrated is complex and full of races.
    
    The straight forward solution is to avoid the asychronous update of the TIF
    bit and defer it to the next context switch. The speculation control state
    is stored in task_struct::atomic_flags by the prctl and seccomp updates
    already.
    
    Add a new TIF_SPEC_FORCE_UPDATE bit and set this after updating the
    atomic_flags. Check the bit on context switch and force a synchronous
    update of the speculation control if set. Use the same mechanism for
    updating the current task.

    x86/speculation: Split out TIF update
    
    commit e6da8bb6f9abb2628381904b24163c770e630bac upstream
    
    The update of the TIF_SSBD flag and the conditional speculation control MSR
    update is done in the ssb_prctl_set() function directly. The upcoming prctl
    support for controlling indirect branch speculation via STIBP needs the
    same mechanism.
    
    Split the code out and make it reusable. Reword the comment about updates
    for other tasks.

    x86/speculation: Prepare for conditional IBPB in switch_mm()
    
    commit 4c71a2b6fd7e42814aa68a6dec88abf3b42ea573 upstream
    
    The IBPB speculation barrier is issued from switch_mm() when the kernel
    switches to a user space task with a different mm than the user space task
    which ran last on the same CPU.
    
    An additional optimization is to avoid IBPB when the incoming task can be
    ptraced by the outgoing task. This optimization only works when switching
    directly between two user space tasks. When switching from a kernel task to
    a user space task the optimization fails because the previous task cannot
    be accessed anymore. So for quite some scenarios the optimization is just
    adding overhead.
    
    The upcoming conditional IBPB support will issue IBPB only for user space
    tasks which have the TIF_SPEC_IB bit set. This requires to handle the
    following cases:
    
      1) Switch from a user space task (potential attacker) which has
         TIF_SPEC_IB set to a user space task (potential victim) which has
         TIF_SPEC_IB not set.
    
      2) Switch from a user space task (potential attacker) which has
         TIF_SPEC_IB not set to a user space task (potential victim) which has
         TIF_SPEC_IB set.
    
    This needs to be optimized for the case where the IBPB can be avoided when
    only kernel threads ran in between user space tasks which belong to the
    same process.
    
    The current check whether two tasks belong to the same context is using the
    tasks context id. While correct, it's simpler to use the mm pointer because
    it allows to mangle the TIF_SPEC_IB bit into it. The context id based
    mechanism requires extra storage, which creates worse code.
    
    When a task is scheduled out its TIF_SPEC_IB bit is mangled as bit 0 into
    the per CPU storage which is used to track the last user space mm which was
    running on a CPU. This bit can be used together with the TIF_SPEC_IB bit of
    the incoming task to make the decision whether IBPB needs to be issued or
    not to cover the two cases above.
    
    As conditional IBPB is going to be the default, remove the dubious ptrace
    check for the IBPB always case and simply issue IBPB always when the
    process changes.
    
    Move the storage to a different place in the struct as the original one
    created a hole.

    x86/speculation: Avoid __switch_to_xtra() calls
    
    commit 5635d99953f04b550738f6f4c1c532667c3fd872 upstream
    
    The TIF_SPEC_IB bit does not need to be evaluated in the decision to invoke
    __switch_to_xtra() when:
    
     - CONFIG_SMP is disabled
    
     - The conditional STIPB mode is disabled
    
    The TIF_SPEC_IB bit still controls IBPB in both cases so the TIF work mask
    checks might invoke __switch_to_xtra() for nothing if TIF_SPEC_IB is the
    only set bit in the work masks.
    
    Optimize it out by masking the bit at compile time for CONFIG_SMP=n and at
    run time when the static key controlling the conditional STIBP mode is
    disabled.

    x86/speculation: Prepare for per task indirect branch speculation control
    
    commit 5bfbe3ad5840d941b89bcac54b821ba14f50a0ba upstream
    
    To avoid the overhead of STIBP always on, it's necessary to allow per task

    Add a new task flag TIF_SPEC_IB and evaluate it during context switch if
    SMT is active and flag evaluation is enabled by the speculation control

    guest/host switch works properly.
    
    This has no effect because TIF_SPEC_IB cannot be set yet and the static key
    which controls evaluation is off. Preparatory patch for adding the control
    code.
    
    [ tglx: Simplify the context switch logic and make the TIF evaluation
            depend on SMP=y and on the static key controlling the conditional
            update. Rename it to TIF_SPEC_IB because it controls both STIBP and

    x86/speculation: Add command line control for indirect branch speculation
    
    commit fa1202ef224391b6f5b26cdd44cc50495e8fab54 upstream
    
    Add command line control for user space indirect branch speculation
    mitigations. The new option is: spectre_v2_user=
    
    The initial options are:
    
        -  on:   Unconditionally enabled
        - off:   Unconditionally disabled
        -auto:   Kernel selects mitigation (default off for now)
    
    When the spectre_v2= command line argument is either 'on' or 'off' this
    implies that the application to application control follows that state even
    if a contradicting spectre_v2_user= argument is supplied.

    x86/l1tf: Show actual SMT state
    
    commit 130d6f946f6f2a972ee3ec8540b7243ab99abe97 upstream
    
    Use the now exposed real SMT state, not the SMT sysfs control knob
    state. This reflects the state of the system when the mitigation status is
    queried.
    
    This does not change the warning in the VMX launch code. There the
    dependency on the control knob makes sense because siblings could be
    brought online anytime after launching the VM.

    x86/speculation: Rework SMT state change
    
    commit a74cfffb03b73d41e08f84c2e5c87dec0ce3db9f upstream
    
    arch_smt_update() is only called when the sysfs SMT control knob is
    changed. This means that when SMT is enabled in the sysfs control knob the
    system is considered to have SMT active even if all siblings are offline.
    
    To allow finegrained control of the speculation mitigations, the actual SMT
    state is more interesting than the fact that siblings could be enabled.
    
    Rework the code, so arch_smt_update() is invoked from each individual CPU
    hotplug function, and simplify the update function while at it.

    x86/Kconfig: Select SCHED_SMT if SMP enabled
    
    commit dbe733642e01dd108f71436aaea7b328cb28fd87 upstream
    
    CONFIG_SCHED_SMT is enabled by all distros, so there is not a real point to
    have it configurable. The runtime overhead in the core scheduler code is
    minimal because the actual SMT scheduling parts are conditional on a static
    key.
    
    This allows to expose the scheduler's SMT state static key to the
    speculation control code. Alternatively the scheduler's static key could be
    made always available when CONFIG_SMP is enabled, but that's just adding an
    unused static key to every other architecture for nothing.

    sched/smt: Make sched_smt_present track topology
    
    commit c5511d03ec090980732e929c318a7a6374b5550e upstream
    
    Currently the 'sched_smt_present' static key is enabled when at CPU bringup
    SMT topology is observed, but it is never disabled. However there is demand
    to also disable the key when the topology changes such that there is no SMT
    present anymore.
    
    Implement this by making the key count the number of cores that have SMT
    enabled.
    
    In particular, the SMT topology bits are set before interrrupts are enabled
    and similarly, are cleared after interrupts are disabled for the last time
    and the CPU dies.

    x86/speculation: Reorganize speculation control MSRs update
    
    commit 01daf56875ee0cd50ed496a09b20eb369b45dfa5 upstream
    
    The logic to detect whether there's a change in the previous and next
    task's flag relevant to update speculation control MSRs is spread out
    across multiple functions.
    
    Consolidate all checks needed for updating speculation control MSRs into
    the new __speculation_ctrl_update() helper function.
    
    This makes it easy to pick the right speculation control MSR and the bits
    in MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL that need updating based on TIF flags changes.

    x86/speculation: Rename SSBD update functions
    
    commit 26c4d75b234040c11728a8acb796b3a85ba7507c upstream
    
    During context switch, the SSBD bit in SPEC_CTRL MSR is updated according
    to changes of the TIF_SSBD flag in the current and next running task.
    
    Currently, only the bit controlling speculative store bypass disable in
    SPEC_CTRL MSR is updated and the related update functions all have
    "speculative_store" or "ssb" in their names.
    
    For enhanced mitigation control other bits in SPEC_CTRL MSR need to be
    updated as well, which makes the SSB names inadequate.
    
    Rename the "speculative_store*" functions to a more generic name. No
    functional change.

    x86/speculation: Move STIPB/IBPB string conditionals out of cpu_show_common()
    
    commit a8f76ae41cd633ac00be1b3019b1eb4741be3828 upstream
    
    The Spectre V2 printout in cpu_show_common() handles conditionals for the
    various mitigation methods directly in the sprintf() argument list. That's
    hard to read and will become unreadable if more complex decisions need to
    be made for a particular method.
    
    Move the conditionals for STIBP and IBPB string selection into helper
    functions, so they can be extended later on.

    x86/speculation: Apply IBPB more strictly to avoid cross-process data leak
    
    commit dbfe2953f63c640463c630746cd5d9de8b2f63ae upstream
    
    Currently, IBPB is only issued in cases when switching into a non-dumpable
    process, the rationale being to protect such 'important and security
    sensitive' processess (such as GPG) from data leaking into a different
    userspace process via spectre v2.
    
    This is however completely insufficient to provide proper userspace-to-userpace
    spectrev2 protection, as any process can poison branch buffers before being
    scheduled out, and the newly scheduled process immediately becomes spectrev2
    victim.
    
    In order to minimize the performance impact (for usecases that do require
    spectrev2 protection), issue the barrier only in cases when switching between
    processess where the victim can't be ptraced by the potential attacker (as in
    such cases, the attacker doesn't have to bother with branch buffers at all).

      PTRACE_MODE_IBPB to be able to do ptrace() context tracking reasonably
      fine-grained ]

    x86/speculation: Enable cross-hyperthread spectre v2 STIBP mitigation
    
    commit 53c613fe6349994f023245519265999eed75957f upstream
    
    STIBP is a feature provided by certain Intel ucodes / CPUs. This feature
    (once enabled) prevents cross-hyperthread control of decisions made by
    indirect branch predictors.
    
    Enable this feature if
    
    - the CPU is vulnerable to spectre v2
    - the CPU supports SMT and has SMT siblings online
    - spectre_v2 mitigation autoselection is enabled (default)
    
    After some previous discussion, this leaves STIBP on all the time, as wrmsr
    on crossing kernel boundary is a no-no. This could perhaps later be a bit
    more optimized (like disabling it in NOHZ, experiment with disabling it in
    idle, etc) if needed.
    
    Note that the synchronization of the mask manipulation via newly added
    spec_ctrl_mutex is currently not strictly needed, as the only updater is
    already being serialized by cpu_add_remove_lock, but let's make this a
    little bit more future-proof.

    [...}
    
    The reason is that the node timer handler sometimes needs to delete a
    node which has been disconnected for too long. To do this, it grabs
    the lock 'node_list_lock', which may at the same time be held by the
    generic node cleanup function, tipc_node_stop(), during module removal.
    Since the latter is calling del_timer_sync() inside the same lock, we
    have a potential deadlock.
    
    We fix this letting the timer cleanup function use spin_trylock()
    instead of just spin_lock(), and when it fails to grab the lock it
    just returns so that the timer handler can terminate its execution.
    This is safe to do, since tipc_node_stop() anyway is about to
    delete both the timer and the node instance.

    net: phy: add workaround for issue where PHY driver doesn't bind to the device
    
    [ Upstream commit c85ddecae6e5e82ca3ae6f20c63f1d865e2ff5ea ]
    
    After switching the r8169 driver to use phylib some user reported that
    their network is broken. This was caused by the genphy PHY driver being
    used instead of the dedicated PHY driver for the RTL8211B. Users
    reported that loading the Realtek PHY driver module upfront fixes the
    issue. See also this mail thread:
    https://marc.info/?t=154279781800003&r=1&w=2
    The issue is quite weird and the root cause seems to be somewhere in
    the base driver core. The patch works around the issue and may be
    removed once the actual issue is fixed.
    
    The Fixes tag refers to the first reported occurrence of the issue.
    The issue itself may have been existing much longer and it may affect
    users of other network chips as well. Users typically will recognize
    this issue only if their PHY stops working when being used with the
    genphy driver.

    tcp: defer SACK compression after DupThresh
    
    [ Upstream commit 86de5921a3d5dd246df661e09bdd0a6131b39ae3 ]
    
    Jean-Louis reported a TCP regression and bisected to recent SACK
    compression.
    
    After a loss episode (receiver not able to keep up and dropping
    packets because its backlog is full), linux TCP stack is sending
    a single SACK (DUPACK).
    
    Sender waits a full RTO timer before recovering losses.
    
    While RFC 6675 says in section 5, "Algorithm Details",
    
       (2) If DupAcks < DupThresh but IsLost (HighACK + 1) returns true --
           indicating at least three segments have arrived above the current
           cumulative acknowledgment point, which is taken to indicate loss
           -- go to step (4).
    ...
       (4) Invoke fast retransmit and enter loss recovery as follows:
    
    there are old TCP stacks not implementing this strategy, and
    still counting the dupacks before starting fast retransmit.
    
    While these stacks probably perform poorly when receivers implement
    LRO/GRO, we should be a little more gentle to them.
    
    This patch makes sure we do not enable SACK compression unless
    3 dupacks have been sent since last rcv_nxt update.
    
    Ideally we should even rearm the timer to send one or two
    more DUPACK if no more packets are coming, but that will
    be work aiming for linux-4.21.
    
    Many thanks to Jean-Louis for bisecting the issue, providing
    packet captures and testing this patch.

    net/dim: Update DIM start sample after each DIM iteration
    
    [ Upstream commit 0211dda68a4f6531923a2f72d8e8959207f59fba ]
    
    On every iteration of net_dim, the algorithm may choose to
    check for the system state by comparing current data sample
    with previous data sample. After each of these comparison,
    regardless of the action taken, the sample used as baseline
    is needed to be updated.
    
    This patch fixes a bug that causes DIM to take wrong decisions,
    due to never updating the baseline sample for comparison between
    iterations. This way, DIM always compares current sample with
    zeros.
    
    Although this is a functional fix, it also improves and stabilizes
    performance as the algorithm works properly now.
    
    Performance:
    Tested single UDP TX stream with pktgen:
    samples/pktgen/pktgen_sample03_burst_single_flow.sh -i p4p2 -d 1.1.1.1
    -m 24:8a:07:88:26:8b -f 3 -b 128
    
    ConnectX-5 100GbE packet rate improved from 15-19Mpps to 19-20Mpps.
    Also, toggling between profiles is less frequent with the fix.

    [ Upstream commit e59ff2c49ae16e1d179de679aca81405829aee6c ]
    
    We don't disable VIRTIO_NET_F_GUEST_CSUM if XDP was set. This means we
    can receive partial csumed packets with metadata kept in the
    vnet_hdr. This may have several side effects:
    
    - It could be overridden by header adjustment, thus is might be not
      correct after XDP processing.
    - There's no way to pass such metadata information through
      XDP_REDIRECT to another driver.
    - XDP does not support checksum offload right now.
    
    So simply disable guest csum if possible in this the case of XDP.

    net: skb_scrub_packet(): Scrub offload_fwd_mark
    
    [ Upstream commit b5dd186d10ba59e6b5ba60e42b3b083df56df6f3 ]
    
    When a packet is trapped and the corresponding SKB marked as
    already-forwarded, it retains this marking even after it is forwarded
    across veth links into another bridge. There, since it ingresses the
    bridge over veth, which doesn't have offload_fwd_mark, it triggers a
    warning in nbp_switchdev_frame_mark().
    
    Then nbp_switchdev_allowed_egress() decides not to allow egress from
    this bridge through another veth, because the SKB is already marked, and
    the mark (of 0) of course matches. Thus the packet is incorrectly
    blocked.
    
    Solve by resetting offload_fwd_mark() in skb_scrub_packet(). That
    function is called from tunnels and also from veth, and thus catches the
    cases where traffic is forwarded between bridges and transformed in a
    way that invalidates the marking.

    usbnet: ipheth: fix potential recvmsg bug and recvmsg bug 2
    
    [ Upstream commit 45611c61dd503454b2edae00aabe1e429ec49ebe ]
    
    The bug is not easily reproducable, as it may occur very infrequently
    (we had machines with 20minutes heavy downloading before it occurred)
    However, on a virual machine (VMWare on Windows 10 host) it occurred
    pretty frequently (1-2 seconds after a speedtest was started)
    
    dev->tx_skb mab be freed via dev_kfree_skb_irq on a callback
    before it is set.
    
    This causes the following problems:
    - double free of the skb or potential memory leak
    - in dmesg: 'recvmsg bug' and 'recvmsg bug 2' and eventually
      general protection fault
    
    Example dmesg output:

    The proposed patch eliminates a potential racing condition.
    Before, usb_submit_urb was called and _after_ that, the skb was attached
    (dev->tx_skb). So, on a callback it was possible, however unlikely that the
    skb was freed before it was set. That way (because dev->tx_skb was not set
    to NULL after it was freed), it could happen that a skb from a earlier
    transmission was freed a second time (and the skb we should have freed did
    not get freed at all)
    
    Now we free the skb directly in ipheth_tx(). It is not passed to the
    callback anymore, eliminating the posibility of a double free of the same
    skb. Depending on the retval of usb_submit_urb() we use dev_kfree_skb_any()
    respectively dev_consume_skb_any() to free the skb.

    s390/qeth: fix length check in SNMP processing
    
    [ Upstream commit 9a764c1e59684c0358e16ccaafd870629f2cfe67 ]
    
    The response for a SNMP request can consist of multiple parts, which
    the cmd callback stages into a kernel buffer until all parts have been
    received. If the callback detects that the staging buffer provides
    insufficient space, it bails out with error.
    This processing is buggy for the first part of the response - while it
    initially checks for a length of 'data_len', it later copies an
    additional amount of 'offsetof(struct qeth_snmp_cmd, data)' bytes.
    
    Fix the calculation of 'data_len' for the first part of the response.
    This also nicely cleans up the memcpy code.

    packet: copy user buffers before orphan or clone
    
    [ Upstream commit 5cd8d46ea1562be80063f53c7c6a5f40224de623 ]
    
    tpacket_snd sends packets with user pages linked into skb frags. It
    notifies that pages can be reused when the skb is released by setting
    skb->destructor to tpacket_destruct_skb.
    
    This can cause data corruption if the skb is orphaned (e.g., on
    transmit through veth) or cloned (e.g., on mirror to another psock).
    
    Create a kernel-private copy of data in these cases, same as tun/tap
    zerocopy transmission. Reuse that infrastructure: mark the skb as
    SKBTX_ZEROCOPY_FRAG, which will trigger copy in skb_orphan_frags(_rx).
    
    Unlike other zerocopy packets, do not set shinfo destructor_arg to
    struct ubuf_info. tpacket_destruct_skb already uses that ptr to notify
    when the original skb is released and a timestamp is recorded. Do not
    change this timestamp behavior. The ubuf_info->callback is not needed
    anyway, as no zerocopy notification is expected.
    
    Mark destructor_arg as not-a-uarg by setting the lower bit to 1. The
    resulting value is not a valid ubuf_info pointer, nor a valid
    tpacket_snd frame address. Add skb_zcopy_.._nouarg helpers for this.
    
    The fix relies on features introduced in commit 52267790ef52 ("sock:
    add MSG_ZEROCOPY"), so can be backported as is only to 4.14.
    
    Tested with from `./in_netns.sh ./txring_overwrite` from
    http://github.com/wdebruij/kerneltools/tests

    net: don't keep lonely packets forever in the gro hash
    
    [ Upstream commit 605108acfe6233b72e2f803aa1cb59a2af3001ca ]
    
    Eric noted that with UDP GRO and NAPI timeout, we could keep a single
    UDP packet inside the GRO hash forever, if the related NAPI instance
    calls napi_gro_complete() at an higher frequency than the NAPI timeout.
    Willem noted that even TCP packets could be trapped there, till the
    next retransmission.
    This patch tries to address the issue, flushing the old packets -
    those with a NAPI_GRO_CB age before the current jiffy - before scheduling
    the NAPI timeout. The rationale is that such a timeout should be
    well below a jiffy and we are not flushing packets eligible for sane GRO.
    
    v1  -> v2:
     - clarified the commit message and comment
    
    RFC -> v1:
     - added 'Fixes tags', cleaned-up the wording.

    lan743x: fix return value for lan743x_tx_napi_poll
    
    [ Upstream commit cc5922054131f9abefdc0622ae64fc55e6b2671d ]
    
    The lan743x driver, when under heavy traffic load, has been noticed
    to sometimes hang, or cause a kernel panic.
    
    Debugging reveals that the TX napi poll routine was returning
    the wrong value, 'weight'. Most other drivers return 0.
    And call napi_complete, instead of napi_complete_done.
    
    Additionally when creating the tx napi poll routine.
    Changed netif_napi_add, to netif_tx_napi_add.
    
    Updates for v3:
        changed 'fixes' tag to match defined format
    
    Updates for v2:
    use napi_complete, instead of napi_complete_done in
        lan743x_tx_napi_poll
    use netif_tx_napi_add, instead of netif_napi_add for
        registration of tx napi poll routine

    mm/khugepaged: collapse_shmem() do not crash on Compound
    
    commit 06a5e1268a5fb9c2b346a3da6b97e85f2eba0f07 upstream.
    
    collapse_shmem()'s VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(PageTransCompound) was unsafe: before
    it holds page lock of the first page, racing truncation then extension
    might conceivably have inserted a hugepage there already.  Fail with the
    SCAN_PAGE_COMPOUND result, instead of crashing (CONFIG_DEBUG_VM=y) or
    otherwise mishandling the unexpected hugepage - though later we might
    code up a more constructive way of handling it, with SCAN_SUCCESS.

    mm/khugepaged: collapse_shmem() without freezing new_page
    
    commit 87c460a0bded56195b5eb497d44709777ef7b415 upstream.
    
    khugepaged's collapse_shmem() does almost all of its work, to assemble
    the huge new_page from 512 scattered old pages, with the new_page's
    refcount frozen to 0 (and refcounts of all old pages so far also frozen
    to 0).  Including shmem_getpage() to read in any which were out on swap,
    memory reclaim if necessary to allocate their intermediate pages, and
    copying over all the data from old to new.
    
    Imagine the frozen refcount as a spinlock held, but without any lock
    debugging to highlight the abuse: it's not good, and under serious load
    heads into lockups - speculative getters of the page are not expecting
    to spin while khugepaged is rescheduled.
    
    One can get a little further under load by hacking around elsewhere; but
    fortunately, freezing the new_page turns out to have been entirely
    unnecessary, with no hacks needed elsewhere.
    
    The huge new_page lock is already held throughout, and guards all its
    subpages as they are brought one by one into the page cache tree; and
    anything reading the data in that page, without the lock, before it has
    been marked PageUptodate, would already be in the wrong.  So simply
    eliminate the freezing of the new_page.
    
    Each of the old pages remains frozen with refcount 0 after it has been
    replaced by a new_page subpage in the page cache tree, until they are
    all unfrozen on success or failure: just as before.  They could be
    unfrozen sooner, but cause no problem once no longer visible to
    find_get_entry(), filemap_map_pages() and other speculative lookups.

    update stats while interrupts still disabled from the last iteration.

    mm/khugepaged: collapse_shmem() remember to clear holes
    
    commit 2af8ff291848cc4b1cce24b6c943394eb2c761e8 upstream.
    
    Huge tmpfs testing reminds us that there is no __GFP_ZERO in the gfp
    flags khugepaged uses to allocate a huge page - in all common cases it
    would just be a waste of effort - so collapse_shmem() must remember to
    clear out any holes that it instantiates.
    
    The obvious place to do so, where they are put into the page cache tree,
    is not a good choice: because interrupts are disabled there.  Leave it
    until further down, once success is assured, where the other pages are
    copied (before setting PageUptodate).

    mm/khugepaged: fix crashes due to misaccounted holes
    
    commit aaa52e340073b7f4593b3c4ddafcafa70cf838b5 upstream.
    
    Huge tmpfs testing on a shortish file mapped into a pmd-rounded extent
    hit shmem_evict_inode()'s WARN_ON(inode->i_blocks) followed by
    clear_inode()'s BUG_ON(inode->i_data.nrpages) when the file was later
    closed and unlinked.
    
    khugepaged's collapse_shmem() was forgetting to update mapping->nrpages
    on the rollback path, after it had added but then needs to undo some
    holes.
    
    There is indeed an irritating asymmetry between shmem_charge(), whose
    callers want it to increment nrpages after successfully accounting
    blocks, and shmem_uncharge(), when __delete_from_page_cache() already
    decremented nrpages itself: oh well, just add a comment on that to them
    both.
    
    And shmem_recalc_inode() is supposed to be called when the accounting is
    expected to be in balance (so it can deduce from imbalance that reclaim
    discarded some pages): so change shmem_charge() to update nrpages
    earlier (though it's rare for the difference to matter at all).

    mm/huge_memory: fix lockdep complaint on 32-bit i_size_read()
    
    commit 006d3ff27e884f80bd7d306b041afc415f63598f upstream.
    
    Huge tmpfs testing, on 32-bit kernel with lockdep enabled, showed that
    __split_huge_page() was using i_size_read() while holding the irq-safe
    lru_lock and page tree lock, but the 32-bit i_size_read() uses an
    irq-unsafe seqlock which should not be nested inside them.
    
    Instead, read the i_size earlier in split_huge_page_to_list(), and pass
    the end offset down to __split_huge_page(): all while holding head page
    lock, which is enough to prevent truncation of that extent before the
    page tree lock has been taken.

    mm/huge_memory: splitting set mapping+index before unfreeze
    
    commit 173d9d9fd3ddae84c110fea8aedf1f26af6be9ec upstream.
    
    Huge tmpfs stress testing has occasionally hit shmem_undo_range()'s
    VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_to_pgoff(page) != index, page).
    
    Move the setting of mapping and index up before the page_ref_unfreeze()
    in __split_huge_page_tail() to fix this: so that a page cache lookup
    cannot get a reference while the tail's mapping and index are unstable.
    
    In fact, might as well move them up before the smp_wmb(): I don't see an
    actual need for that, but if I'm missing something, this way round is
    safer than the other, and no less efficient.
    
    You might argue that VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_to_pgoff(page) != index, page) is
    misplaced, and should be left until after the trylock_page(); but left as
    is has not crashed since, and gives more stringent assurance.

    mm/huge_memory: rename freeze_page() to unmap_page()
    
    commit 906f9cdfc2a0800f13683f9e4ebdfd08c12ee81b upstream.
    
    The term "freeze" is used in several ways in the kernel, and in mm it
    has the particular meaning of forcing page refcount temporarily to 0.
    freeze_page() is just too confusing a name for a function that unmaps a
    page: rename it unmap_page(), and rename unfreeze_page() remap_page().
    
    Went to change the mention of freeze_page() added later in mm/rmap.c,
    but found it to be incorrect: ordinary page reclaim reaches there too;
    but the substance of the comment still seems correct, so edit it down.
