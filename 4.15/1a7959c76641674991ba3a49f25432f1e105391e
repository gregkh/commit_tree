net: qrtr: Clean up control packet handling

As the message header generation is deferred the internal functions for
generating control packets can be simplified.

This patch modifies qrtr_alloc_ctrl_packet() to, in addition to the
sk_buff, return a reference to a struct qrtr_ctrl_pkt, which clarifies
and simplifies the helpers to the point that these functions can be
folded back into the callers.
