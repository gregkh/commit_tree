printk: Remove superfluous memory barriers from printk_safe

The variable printk_safe_irq_ready is set and never cleared at system
boot up, when there's only one CPU active. It is set before other
CPUs come on line. Also, it is extremely unlikely that an NMI would
trigger this early in boot up (which I wonder why we even have this
variable at all).

Also mark the printk_safe_irq_ready as read mostly, as it is set at
system boot up, and never touched again.
