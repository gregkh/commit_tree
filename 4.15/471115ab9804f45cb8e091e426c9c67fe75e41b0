qed: Fix maximum number of CQs for iWARP

The maximum number of CQs supported is bound to the number
of connections supported, which differs between RoCE and iWARP.

This fixes a crash that occurred in iWARP when running 1000 sessions
using perftest.

Fixes: 67b40dccc45 ("qed: Implement iWARP initialization, teardown and qp operations")
