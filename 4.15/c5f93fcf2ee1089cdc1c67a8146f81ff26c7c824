drm/i915: Disable infoframes when shutting down DDI HDMI

Disabling the video DIP when shutting the port down seems like a good
idea.

Bspec says:
"When disabling both the DIP port and DIP transmission,
 first disable the port and then disable DIP."
and
"Restriction : GCP is only supported with HDMI when the bits per color is
 not equal to 8. GCP must be enabled prior to enabling TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL
 for HDMI with bits per color not equal to 8 and disabled after disabling
 TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL"

So let's do it in the .post_disable() hook.
