KVM: arm/arm64: GICv4: Handle MOVALL applied to a vPE

The current implementation of MOVALL doesn't allow us to call
into the core ITS code as we hold a number of spinlocks.

Let's try a method used in other parts of the code, were we copy
the intids of the candicate interrupts, and then do whatever
we need to do with them outside of the critical section.

This allows us to move the interrupts one by one, at the expense
of a bit of CPU time. Who cares? MOVALL is such a stupid command
anyway...
