drm/rockchip: add CONFIG_OF dependency for lvds

Build-testing on randconfig kernels revealed a dependency in the
newly added lvds sub-driver:

drivers/gpu/drm/rockchip/rockchip_lvds.c: In function 'rockchip_lvds_bind':
drivers/gpu/drm/rockchip/rockchip_lvds.c:380:24: error: 'struct drm_bridge' has no member named 'of_node'
   remote = lvds->bridge->of_node;

We could work around that in the code, adding a Kconfig dependency
seems easier.
