drm/edid: Don't send non-zero YQ in AVI infoframe for HDMI 1.x sinks

Apparently some sinks look at the YQ bits even when receiving RGB,
and they get somehow confused when they see a non-zero YQ value.
So we can't just blindly follow CEA-861-F and set YQ to match the
RGB range.

Unfortunately there is no good way to tell whether the sink
designer claims to have read CEA-861-F. The CEA extension block
revision number has generally been stuck at 3 since forever,
and even a very recently manufactured sink might be based on
an old design so the manufacturing date doesn't seem like
something we can use. In lieu of better information let's
follow CEA-861-F only for HDMI 2.0 sinks, since HDMI 2.0 is
based on CEA-861-F. For HDMI 1.x sinks we'll always set YQ=0.

The alternative would of course be to always set YQ=0. And if
we ever encounter a HDMI 2.0+ sink with this bug that's what
we'll probably have to do.
