PM / core: Add SMART_SUSPEND driver flag

Define and document a SMART_SUSPEND flag to instruct bus types and PM
domains that the system suspend callbacks provided by the driver can
cope with runtime-suspended devices, so from the driver's perspective
it should be safe to leave devices in runtime suspend during system
suspend.

Setting that flag may also cause middle-layer code (bus types,
PM domains etc.) to skip invocations of the ->suspend_late and
->suspend_noirq callbacks provided by the driver if the device
is in runtime suspend at the beginning of the "late" phase of
the system-wide suspend transition, in which case the driver's
system-wide resume callbacks may be invoked back-to-back with
its ->runtime_suspend callback, so the driver has to be able to
cope with that too.
