PM / sleep: Avoid excess pm_runtime_enable() calls in device_resume()

Middle-layer code doing suspend-time optimizations for devices with
the DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND flag set (currently, the PCI bus type and
the ACPI PM domain) needs to make the core skip ->thaw_early and
->thaw callbacks for those devices in some cases and it sets the
power.direct_complete flag for them for this purpose.

However, it turns out that setting power.direct_complete outside of
the PM core is a bad idea as it triggers an excess invocation of
pm_runtime_enable() in device_resume().

For this reason, provide a helper to clear power.is_late_suspended
and power.is_suspended to be invoked by the middle-layer code in
question instead of setting power.direct_complete and make that code
call the new helper.
