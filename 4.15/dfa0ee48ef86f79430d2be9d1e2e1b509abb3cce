documentation: Long-running irq handlers can stall RCU grace periods

If a periodic interrupt's handler takes longer to execute than the period
between successive interrupts, RCU's kthreads and softirq handlers can
be prevented from executing, resulting in otherwise inexplicable RCU
CPU stall warnings.  This commit therefore calls out this possibility
in Documentation/RCU/stallwarn.txt.
