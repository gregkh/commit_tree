xfs: validate sb_logsunit is a multiple of the fs blocksize

Make sure the log stripe unit is sane before proceeding with mounting.
AFAICT this means that logsunit has to be 0, 1, or a multiple of the fs
block size.  Found this by setting the LSB of logsunit in xfs/350 and
watching the system crash as soon as we try to write to the log.
