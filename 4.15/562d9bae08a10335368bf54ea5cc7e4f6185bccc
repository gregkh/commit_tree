drm/i915: Name structure in dev_priv that contains RPS/RC6 state as "gt_pm"

Prepared substructure rps for RPS related state. autoenable_work is
used for RC6 too hence it is defined outside rps structure. As we do
this lot many functions are refactored to use intel_rps *rps to access
rps related members. Hence renamed intel_rps_client pointer variables
to rps_client in various functions.

v2: Rebase.

v3: s/pm/gt_pm (Chris)
Refactored access to rps structure by declaring struct intel_rps * in
many functions.
