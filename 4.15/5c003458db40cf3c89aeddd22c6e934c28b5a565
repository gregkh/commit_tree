platform/x86: intel_cht_int33fe: Work around BIOS bug on some devices

At least one BIOS enumerates the max17047 both through the INT33FE ACPI
device (it is right there in the resources table) as well as through a
separate MAX17047 device.

This commit checks for the max17047 already being enumerated through
a separate MAX17047 ACPI device and if so it uses the i2c-client
instantiated for this and attaches the device-props for the max17047 to
that i2c-client.
