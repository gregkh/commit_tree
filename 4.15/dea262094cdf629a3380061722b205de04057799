IB/srpt: Change default behavior from using SRQ to using RC

Although in the RC mode more resources are needed that mode has three
advantages over SRQ:
- It works with all RDMA adapters, even those that do not support
  SRQ.
- Posting WRs and polling WCs does not trigger lock contention
  because only one thread at a time accesses a WR or WC queue in
  non-SRQ mode.
- The end-to-end flow control mechanism is used.

>From the IB spec:

    C9-150.2.1: For QPs that are not associated with an SRQ, each HCA
    receive queue shall generate end-to-end flow control credits. If
    a QP is associated with an SRQ, the HCA receive queue shall not
    generate end-to-end flow control credits.

Add new configfs attributes that allow to configure which mode to use
(/sys/kernel/config/target/srpt/$GUID/$GUID/attrib/use_srq). Note:
only the attribute for port 1 is relevant on multi-port adapters.
