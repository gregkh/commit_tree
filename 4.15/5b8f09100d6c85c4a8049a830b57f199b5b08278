drm/sun4i: tcon: Don't rely on encoders to set the TCON mode

Just like we did for the TCON enable and disable, for historical reasons we
used to rely on the encoders calling the TCON mode_set function, while the
CRTC has a callback for that.

Let's implement it in order to reduce the boilerplate code.
