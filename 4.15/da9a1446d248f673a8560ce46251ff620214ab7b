KVM: s390: provide a capability for AIS state migration

The AIS capability was introduced in 4.12, while the interface to
migrate the state was added in 4.13. Unfortunately it is not possible
for userspace to detect the migration capability without creating a flic
kvm device. As in QEMU the cpu model detection runs on the "none"
machine this will result in cpu model issues regarding the "ais"
capability.

To get the "ais" capability properly let's add a new KVM capability that
tells userspace that AIS states can be migrated.
