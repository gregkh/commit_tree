ASoC: Intel: Enable tdm slots for max98927

In this patch the SSP0 BE's mode is changed from I2S mode to DSP_B
with 8 slots of 16 bits. It enables 4 slot for IV feedback and 2 slots for
playback on max98927 for kabylake machine driver

The layout of SSP0 Tx and Rx slots is as follows;
1. Playback uses Tx slots 0 and 1
2. Capture uses Rx slots 4,5,6,7.

Slots 0 through 3 of Rx are used by DMIC codec RT5514 in another flavor
of Kabylake platform. We are using the same slots 4 through 7 on all
Kabylake platforms for max98927 in order to reuse same NHLT configuration.
