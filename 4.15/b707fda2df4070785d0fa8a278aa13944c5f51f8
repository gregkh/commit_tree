xen-netfront: enable device after manual module load

When loading the module after unloading it, the network interface would
not be enabled and thus wouldn't have a backend counterpart and unable
to be used by the guest.

The guest would face errors like:

  [root@guest ~]# ethtool -i eth0
  Cannot get driver information: No such device

  [root@guest ~]# ifconfig eth0
  eth0: error fetching interface information: Device not found

This patch initializes the state of the netfront device whenever it is
loaded manually, this state would communicate the netback to create its
device and establish the connection between them.
