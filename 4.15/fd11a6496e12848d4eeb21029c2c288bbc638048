x86/umip: Print a warning into the syslog if UMIP-protected instructions are used

Print a rate-limited warning when a user-space program attempts to execute
any of the instructions that UMIP protects (i.e., SGDT, SIDT, SLDT, STR
and SMSW).

This is useful, because when CONFIG_X86_INTEL_UMIP=y is selected and
supported by the hardware, user space programs that try to execute such
instructions will receive a SIGSEGV signal that they might not expect.

In the specific cases for which emulation is provided (instructions SGDT,
SIDT and SMSW in protected and virtual-8086 modes), no signal is
generated. However, a warning is helpful to encourage updates in such
programs to avoid the use of such instructions.

Warnings are printed via a customized printk() function that also provides
information about the program that attempted to use the affected
instructions.

Utility macros are defined to wrap umip_printk() for the error and warning
kernel log levels.

While here, replace an existing call to the generic rate-limited pr_err()
with the new umip_pr_err().
