ti_sci: Use %pS printk format for direct addresses

Use the %pS printk format for printing symbols from direct addresses.
This is important for the ia64, ppc64 and parisc64 architectures, while on
other architectures there is no difference between %pS and %pF.
Fix it for consistency across the kernel.
