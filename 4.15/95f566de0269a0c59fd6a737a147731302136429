of_mdio: avoid MDIO bus removal when a PHY is missing

If one of the child devices is missing the of_mdiobus_register_phy()
call will return -ENODEV. When a missing device is encountered the
registration of the remaining PHYs is stopped and the MDIO bus will
fail to register. Propagate all errors except ENODEV to avoid it.
