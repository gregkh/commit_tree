drm/i915: align 64K objects to 2M

We can't mix 64K and 4K pte's in the same page-table, so for now we
align 64K objects to 2M to avoid any potential mixing. This is
potentially wasteful but in reality shouldn't be too bad since this only
applies to the virtual address space of a 48b PPGTT.

v2: don't separate logically connected ops
