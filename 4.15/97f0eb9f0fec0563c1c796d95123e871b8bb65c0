md/bitmap: clear BITMAP_WRITE_ERROR bit before writing it to sb

For a RAID1 device using a file-based bitmap, if a bitmap write error
occurs but the later writes succeed, it's possible both BITMAP_STALE
and BITMAP_WRITE_ERROR bits will be written to the bitmap super block,
the BITMAP_STALE bit will be handled properly and be cleared, but the
BITMAP_WRITE_ERROR bit in sb->flags will make bitmap_create() to fail.

So clear it to protect against the write failure-and-then-recovery case.
