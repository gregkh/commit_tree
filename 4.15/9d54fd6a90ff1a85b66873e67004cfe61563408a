Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Make acpi_probe get irq from ACPI resources

The ACPI subsys is going to move over to instantiating ACPI enumerated
HCIs as serdevs, rather then as platform devices.

So we need to make bcm_acpi_probe() suitable for use on non platform-
devices too, which means that we cannot rely on platform_get_irq()
getting called.

This commit modifies bcm_acpi_probe() to directly get the irq from
the ACPI resources, this is a preparation patch for adding (runtime)pm
support to the serdev path.
