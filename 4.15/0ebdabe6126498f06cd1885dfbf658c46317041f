drm/i915/bios: parse SDVO device mapping from pre-parsed child devices

We parse and store the child devices in
parse_general_definitions(). There is no need to parse the VBT block
again for SDVO device mapping. Do the same as we do in
parse_ddi_ports().

We no longer have access to child device size at this stage, but we also
don't need to worry about reading past the child device anymore. Instead
of a child device size check, do a mild optimization by limiting the
parsing to gens 3 through 7.
