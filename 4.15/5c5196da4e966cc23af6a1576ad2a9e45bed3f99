KVM: arm/arm64: Support EL1 phys timer register access in set/get reg

Add suport for the physical timer registers in kvm_arm_timer_set_reg and
kvm_arm_timer_get_reg so that these functions can be reused to interact
with the rest of the system.

Note that this paves part of the way for the physical timer state
save/restore, but we still need to add those registers to
KVM_GET_REG_LIST before we support migrating the physical timer state.
