powerpc/powernv: Reserve a hole which appears after enabling IOV

In order to make generic IOV code work, the physical function IOV BAR
should start from offset of the first VF. Since M64 segments share
PE number space across PHB, and some PEs may be in use at the time
when IOV is enabled, the existing code shifts the IOV BAR to the index
of the first PE/VF. This creates a hole in IOMEM space which can be
potentially taken by some other device.

This reserves a temporary hole on a parent and releases it when IOV is
disabled; the temporary resources are stored in pci_dn to avoid
kmalloc/free.
