net/mlx5e: Fix features check of IPv6 traffic

The assumption that the next header field contains the transport
protocol is wrong for IPv6 packets with extension headers.
Instead, we should look the inner-most next header field in the buffer.
This will fix TSO offload for tunnels over IPv6 with extension headers.

Performance testing: 19.25x improvement, cool!
