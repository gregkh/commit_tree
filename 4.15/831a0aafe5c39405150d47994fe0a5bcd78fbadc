tools: bpftool: add JSON output for `bpftool map *` commands

Reuse the json_writer API introduced in an earlier commit to make
bpftool able to generate JSON output on
`bpftool map { show | dump | lookup | getnext }` commands. Remaining
commands produce no output.

Some functions have been spit into plain-output and JSON versions in
order to remain readable.

Outputs for sample maps have been successfully tested against a JSON
validator.
