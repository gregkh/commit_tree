ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: Enable UAS support for Odroid HC1 board

Odroid HC1 board has built-in JMicron USB to SATA bridge, which supports
UAS protocol. Enable support for it to make sure that all built-in storage
devices are available. Enable it as module to keep in line with multi_v7
policy to enable drivers as build-in only if they are critical for boot
process. On Odroid HC1 the kernel itself has to be still read from the
SD-card, so assume that modules/initrd is also accessible there.
