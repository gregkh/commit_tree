tcp_bbr: reset full pipe detection on loss recovery undo

Fix BBR so that upon notification of a loss recovery undo BBR resets
the full pipe detection (STARTUP exit) state machine.

Under high reordering, reordering events can be interpreted as loss.
If the reordering and spurious loss estimates are high enough, this
could previously cause BBR to spuriously estimate that the pipe is
full.

Since spurious loss recovery means that our overall sending will have
slowed down spuriously, this commit gives a flow more time to probe
robustly for bandwidth and decide the pipe is really full.
