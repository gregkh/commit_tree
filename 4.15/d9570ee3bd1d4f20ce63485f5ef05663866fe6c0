kmemleak: allow to coexist with fault injection

kmemleak does one slab allocation per user allocation.  So if slab fault
injection is enabled to any degree, kmemleak instantly fails to allocate
and turns itself off.  However, it's useful to use kmemleak with fault
injection to find leaks on error paths.  On the other hand, checking
kmemleak itself is not so useful because (1) it's a debugging tool and
(2) it has a very regular allocation pattern (basically a single
allocation site, so it either works or not).

Turn off fault injection for kmemleak allocations.
