ecryptfs: remove private bin2hex implementation

Calling sprintf in a loop is not very efficient, and in any case, we
already have an implementation of bin-to-hex conversion in lib/ which
we might as well use.

Note that ecryptfs_to_hex used to nul-terminate the destination (and
the kernel doc was wrong about the required output size), while
bin2hex doesn't. [All but one user of ecryptfs_to_hex explicitly
nul-terminates the result anyway.]
