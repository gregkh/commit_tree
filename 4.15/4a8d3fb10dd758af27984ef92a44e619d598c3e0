staging: lustre: ldlm: remove unnecessary 'ownlocks' variable.

Now that the code has been simplified, 'ownlocks' is not
necessary.

The loop which sets it exits with 'lock' having the same value as
'ownlocks', or pointing to the head of the list if ownlocks is NULL.

The current code then tests ownlocks and sets 'lock' to exactly the
value that it currently has.

So discard 'ownlocks'.

Also remove unnecessary initialization of 'lock'.
