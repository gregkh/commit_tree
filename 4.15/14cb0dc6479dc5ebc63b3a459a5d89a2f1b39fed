block: don't let passthrough IO go into .make_request_fn()

Commit a8821f3f3("block: Improvements to bounce-buffer handling") tries
to make sure that the bio to .make_request_fn won't exceed BIO_MAX_PAGES,
but ignores that passthrough I/O can use blk_queue_bounce() too.
Especially, passthrough IO may not be sector-aligned, and the check
of 'sectors < bio_sectors(*bio_orig)' inside __blk_queue_bounce() may
become true even though the max bvec number doesn't exceed BIO_MAX_PAGES,
then cause the bio splitted, and the original passthrough bio is submited
to generic_make_request().

This patch fixes this issue by checking if the bio is passthrough IO,
and use bio_kmalloc() to allocate the cloned passthrough bio.
