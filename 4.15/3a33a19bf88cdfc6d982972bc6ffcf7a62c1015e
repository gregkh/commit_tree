tipc: fix memory leak of group member when peer node is lost

When a group member receives a member WITHDRAW event, this might have
two reasons: either the peer member is leaving the group, or the link
to the member's node has been lost.

In the latter case we need to issue a DOWN event to the user right away,
and let function tipc_group_filter_msg() perform delete of the member
item. However, in this case we miss to change the state of the member
item to MBR_LEAVING, so the member item is not deleted, and we have a
memory leak.

We now separate better between the four sub-cases of a WITHRAW event
and make sure that each case is handled correctly.
