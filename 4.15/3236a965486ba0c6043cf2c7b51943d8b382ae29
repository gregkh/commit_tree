serial: 8250_fintek: Fix rs485 disablement on invalid ioctl()

This driver's ->rs485_config callback checks if SER_RS485_RTS_ON_SEND
and SER_RS485_RTS_AFTER_SEND have the same value.  If they do, it means
the user has passed in invalid data with the TIOCSRS485 ioctl()
since RTS must have a different polarity when sending and when not
sending.  In this case, rs485 mode is not enabled (the RS485_URA bit
is not set in the RS485 Enable Register) and this is supposed to be
signaled back to the user by clearing the SER_RS485_ENABLED bit in
struct serial_rs485 ... except a missing tilde character is preventing
that from happening.
