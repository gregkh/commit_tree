drm/i915: Constify states passed to enable/disable/etc. encoder hooks

The enable/disable/etc. encoder hooks aren't supposed to alter the
state(s), so pass them as const. Unfortunately C lacks any kind of deep
const thingy, so this can't catch all abuses. But at least it acts as a
hint to the reader telling them not to mess about with the state(s).

v2: Update intel_tv_mode_find() and ironlake_edp_pll_on() as well
v3: Deal with intel_sdvo_connector_state
