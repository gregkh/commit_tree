mm: drop migrate type checks from has_unmovable_pages

Michael has noticed that the memory offline tries to migrate kernel code
pages when doing

 echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory0/online

The current implementation will fail the operation after several failed
page migration attempts but we shouldn't even attempt to migrate that
memory and fail right away because this memory is clearly not
migrateable.  This will become a real problem when we drop the retry
loop counter resp.  timeout.

The real problem is in has_unmovable_pages in fact.  We should fail if
there are any non migrateable pages in the area.  In orther to guarantee
that remove the migrate type checks because MIGRATE_MOVABLE is not
guaranteed to contain only migrateable pages.  It is merely a heuristic.
Similarly MIGRATE_CMA does guarantee that the page allocator doesn't
allocate any non-migrateable pages from the block but CMA allocations
themselves are unlikely to migrateable.  Therefore remove both checks.
