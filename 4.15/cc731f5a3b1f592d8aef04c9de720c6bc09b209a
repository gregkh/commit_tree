drm/i915: Trim struct_mutex hold duration for i915_gem_free_objects

We free objects in bulk after they wait for their RCU grace period.
Currently, we take struct_mutex and unbind all the objects. This can lead
to a long lock duration during which time those objects have their pages
unfreeable (i.e. the shrinker is prevented from reaping those pages). If
we only process a single object under the struct_mutex and then free the
pages, the number of objects locked away from the shrinker is minimal
and we allow regular clients better access to struct_mutex if they need
it.
