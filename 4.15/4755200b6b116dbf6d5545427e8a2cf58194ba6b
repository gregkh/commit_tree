binfmt_elf: don't attempt to load FDPIC binaries

On platforms where both ELF and ELF-FDPIC variants are available, the
regular ELF loader will happily identify FDPIC binaries as proper ELF
and load them without the necessary FDPIC fixups, resulting in an
immediate user space crash. Let's prevent binflt_elf from loading those
binaries so binfmt_elf_fdpic has a chance to pick them up. For those
architectures that don't define elf_check_fdpic(), a default version
returning false is provided.
