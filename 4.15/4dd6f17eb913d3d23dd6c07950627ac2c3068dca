KVM: s390: clear_io_irq() requests are not expected for adapter interrupts

There is a chance to delete not yet delivered I/O interrupts if an
exploiter uses the subsystem identification word 0x0000 while
processing a KVM_DEV_FLIC_CLEAR_IO_IRQ ioctl. -EINVAL will be returned
now instead in that case.

Classic interrupts will always have bit 0x10000 set in the schid while
adapter interrupts have a zero schid. The clear_io_irq interface is
only useful for classic interrupts (as adapter interrupts belong to
many devices). Let's make this interface more strict and forbid a schid
of 0.
