scsi: lpfc: Fix oops of nvme host during driver unload.

When running NVME io as a NVME host, if the driver is unloaded there
would be oops in lpfc_sli4_issue_wqe.

When unloading, controllers are torn down and the transport initiates
set_property commands to reset the controller and issues aborts to
terminate existing io.  The drivers nvme abort and fcp io submit
routines needed to recognize the driver is unloading and fail the new
requests. It didn't, resulting in the oops.

Revise the ls and fcp io submit routines to detect the unloading state
and properly handle their cleanup.
