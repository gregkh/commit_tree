sctp: do not allow the v4 socket to bind a v4mapped v6 address

The check in sctp_sockaddr_af is not robust enough to forbid binding a
v4mapped v6 addr on a v4 socket.

The worse thing is that v4 socket's bind_verify would not convert this
v4mapped v6 addr to a v4 addr. syzbot even reported a crash as the v4
socket bound a v6 addr.

This patch is to fix it by doing the common sa.sa_family check first,
then AF_INET check for v4mapped v6 addrs.

Fixes: 7dab83de50c7 ("sctp: Support ipv6only AF_INET6 sockets.")
