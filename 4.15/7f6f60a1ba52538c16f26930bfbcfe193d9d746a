mm/early_ioremap: Fix boot hang with earlyprintk=efi,keep

earlyprintk=efi,keep does not work any more with a warning
in mm/early_ioremap.c: WARN_ON(system_state != SYSTEM_BOOTING):
Boot just hangs because of the earlyprintk within the earlyprintk
implementation code itself.

This is caused by a new introduced middle state in:

  69a78ff226fe ("init: Introduce SYSTEM_SCHEDULING state")

early_ioremap() is fine in both SYSTEM_BOOTING and SYSTEM_SCHEDULING
states, original condition should be updated accordingly.
