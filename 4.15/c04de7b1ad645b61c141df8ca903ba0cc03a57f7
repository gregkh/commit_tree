MIPS: CM: Drop WARN_ON(vp != 0)

Since commit 68923cdc2eb3 ("MIPS: CM: Add cluster & block args to
mips_cm_lock_other()"), mips_smp_send_ipi_mask() has used
mips_cm_lock_other_cpu() with each CPU number, rather than
mips_cm_lock_other() with the first VPE in each core. Prior to r6,
multicore multithreaded systems such as dual-core dual-thread
interAptivs with CPU Idle enabled (e.g. MIPS Creator Ci40) results in
mips_cm_lock_other() repeatedly hitting WARN_ON(vp != 0).

There doesn't appear to be anything fundamentally wrong about passing a
non-zero VP/VPE number, even if it is a core's region that is locked
into the other region before r6, so remove that particular WARN_ON().
