drm/etnaviv: add 'sync point' support

In order to support performance counters in a sane way we need to provide
a method to sync the GPU with the CPU. The GPU can process multpile command
buffers/events per irq. With the help of a 'sync point' we can trigger an event
and stop the GPU/FE immediately. When the CPU is done with is processing it
simply needs to restart the FE and the GPU will process the command stream.

Changes from v1 -> v2:
- process sync point with a work item to keep irq as fast as possible

Changes from v4 -> v5:
- renamed pmrs_* to sync_point_*
- call event_free(..) in sync_point_worker(..)
