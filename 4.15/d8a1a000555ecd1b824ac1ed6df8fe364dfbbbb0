nfsd: Fix another OPEN stateid race

If nfsd4_process_open2() is initialising a new stateid, and yet the
call to nfs4_get_vfs_file() fails for some reason, then we must
declare the stateid closed, and unhash it before dropping the mutex.

Right now, we unhash the stateid after dropping the mutex, and without
changing the stateid type, meaning that another OPEN could theoretically
look it up and attempt to use it.
