drm/i915: Make i915_engine_info pretty printer to standalone

We can use drm_printer to hide the differences between printk and
seq_printf, and so make the i915_engine_info pretty printer able to be
called from different contexts and not just debugfs. For instance, I
want to use the pretty printer to debug kselftests.
