samples/bpf: Use getppid instead of getpgrp for array map stress

When cross-compiling the bpf sample map_perf_test for aarch64, I find that
__NR_getpgrp is undefined. This causes build errors. This syscall is deprecated
and requires defining __ARCH_WANT_SYSCALL_DEPRECATED. To avoid having to define
that, just use a different syscall (getppid) for the array map stress test.
