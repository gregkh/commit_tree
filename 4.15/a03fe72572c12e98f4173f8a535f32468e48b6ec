MIPS: Factor out NT_PRFPREG regset access helpers

In preparation to fix a commit 72b22bbad1e7 ("MIPS: Don't assume 64-bit
FP registers for FP regset") FCSR access regression factor out
NT_PRFPREG regset access helpers for the non-MSA and the MSA variants
respectively, to avoid having to deal with excessive indentation in the
actual fix.

No functional change, however use `target->thread.fpu.fpr[0]' rather
than `target->thread.fpu.fpr[i]' for FGR holding type size determination
as there's no `i' variable to refer to anymore, and for the factored out
`i' variable declaration use `unsigned int' rather than `unsigned' as
its type, following the common style.
