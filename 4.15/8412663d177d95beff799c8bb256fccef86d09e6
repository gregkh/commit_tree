f2fs: support issuing/waiting discard in range

Fstrim intends to trim invalid blocks of filesystem only with specified
range and granularity, but actually, it will issue all previous cached
discard commands which may be out-of-range and be with unmatched
granularity, it's unneeded.

In order to fix above issues, this patch introduces new helps to support
to issue and wait discard in range and adds a new fstrim_list for tracking
in-flight discard from ->fstrim.
