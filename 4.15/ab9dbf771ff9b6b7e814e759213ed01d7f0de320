Revert "powerpc: Do not call ppc_md.panic in fadump panic notifier"

This reverts commit a3b2cb30f252b21a6f962e0dd107c8b897ca65e4.

That commit tried to fix problems with panic on powerpc in certain
circumstances, where some output from the generic panic code was being
dropped.

Unfortunately, it breaks things worse in other circumstances. In
particular when running a PAPR guest, it will now attempt to reboot
instead of informing the hypervisor (KVM or PowerVM) that the guest
has crashed. The crash notification is important to some
virtualization management layers.

Revert it for now until we can come up with a better solution.
