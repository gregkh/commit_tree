drm/i915/execlists: Read the context-status buffer from the HWSP

The engine provides a mirror of the CSB in the HWSP. If we use the
cacheable reads from the HWSP, we can shave off a few mmio reads per
context-switch interrupt (which are quite frequent!). Just removing a
couple of mmio is not enough to actually reduce any latency, but a small
reduction in overall cpu usage.

Much appreciation for Ben dropping the bombshell that the CSB was in the
HWSP and for Michel in digging out the details.

v2: Don't be lazy, add the defines for the indices.
v3: Include the HWSP in debugfs/i915_engine_info
v4: Check for GVT-g, it currently depends on intercepting CSB mmio
v5: Fixup GVT-g mmio path
v6: Disable HWSP if VT-d is active as the iommu adds unpredictable
memory latency. (Mika)
v7: Also markup the CSB read with READ_ONCE() as it may still be an mmio
read and we want to stop the compiler from issuing a later (v.slow) reload.
