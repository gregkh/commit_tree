tools/kvm_stat: fix missing field update after filter change

When updating the fields filter, tracepoint events of fields previously
not visible were not enabled, as TracepointProvider.update_fields()
updated the member variable directly instead of using the setter, which
triggers the event enable/disable.
To reproduce, run 'kvm_stat -f kvm_exit', press 'c' to remove the
filter, and notice that no add'l fields that do not match the regex
'kvm_exit' will appear.
This issue was introduced by commit c469117df059 ("tools/kvm_stat:
simplify initializers").
