MIPS: Add iomem resource for kernel bss section.

The kexec/kdump tools need to know where the .bss is so it can be
included in the core dump.  This allows vmcore-dmesg to have access to
the dmesg buffers of the crashed kernel as well as allowing the
debugger to examine variables in the bss section.

Add a request for the bss resource in addition to the already
requested code and data sections.
