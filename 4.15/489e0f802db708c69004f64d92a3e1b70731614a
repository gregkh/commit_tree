openrisc: add 1 and 2 byte cmpxchg support

OpenRISC only supports hardware instructions that perform 4 byte atomic
operations.  For enabling qrwlocks for upcoming SMP support 1 and 2 byte
implementations are needed.  To do this we leverage the 4 byte atomic
operations and shift/mask the 1 and 2 byte areas as needed.

This heavily borrows ideas and routines from sh and mips, which do
something similar.
