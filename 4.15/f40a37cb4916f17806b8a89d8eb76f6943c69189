tracing, memcg, vmscan: Hide trace events when not in use

When trace events are defined but not used they still create data
structures and functions for their use, even though nothing may be
using them.

The trace events mm_vmscan_memcg_reclaim_begin,
mm_vmscan_memcg_softlimit_reclaim_begin, mm_vmscan_memcg_reclaim_end,
and mm_vmscan_memcg_softlimit_reclaim_end are not used if CONFIG_MEMCG
is not defined. Do not create these trace events unless CONFIG_MEMCG is
defined.
