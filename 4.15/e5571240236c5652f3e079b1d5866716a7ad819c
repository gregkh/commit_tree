kcm: Check if sk_user_data already set in kcm_attach

This is needed to prevent sk_user_data being overwritten.
The check is done under the callback lock. This should prevent
a socket from being attached twice to a KCM mux. It also prevents
a socket from being attached for other use cases of sk_user_data
as long as the other cases set sk_user_data under the lock.
Followup work is needed to unify all the use cases of sk_user_data
to use the same locking.
