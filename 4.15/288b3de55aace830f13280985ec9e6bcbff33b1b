bpf: offload: move offload device validation out to the drivers

With TC shared block changes we can't depend on correct netdev
pointer being available in cls_bpf.  Move the device validation
to the driver.  Core will only make sure that offloaded programs
are always attached in the driver (or in HW by the driver).  We
trust that drivers which implement offload callbacks will perform
necessary checks.

Moving the checks to the driver is generally a useful thing,
in practice the check should be against a switchdev instance,
not a netdev, given that most ASICs will probably allow using
the same program on many ports.
