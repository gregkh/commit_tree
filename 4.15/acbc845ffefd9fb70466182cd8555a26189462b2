x86/cpufeatures: Re-tabulate the X86_FEATURE definitions

Over the years asm/cpufeatures.h has become somewhat of a mess: the original
tabulation style was too narrow, while x86 feature names also kept growing
in length, creating frequent field width overflows.

Re-tabulate it to make it wider and easier to read/modify. Also harmonize
the tabulation of the other defines in this file to match it.
