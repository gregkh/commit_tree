ASoC: twl4030: fix child-node lookup

Fix child-node lookup during probe, which ended up searching the whole
device tree depth-first starting at the parent rather than just matching
on its children.

To make things worse, the parent codec node was also prematurely freed,
while the child node was leaked.
