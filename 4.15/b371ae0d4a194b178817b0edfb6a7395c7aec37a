x86/apic: Remove init_bsp_APIC()

init_bsp_APIC() which works for the virtual wire mode is used in ISA irq
initialization at boot time.

With the new APIC interrupt delivery mode scheme, which initializes the
APIC before the first interrupt is expected, init_bsp_APIC() is not longer
required and can be removed.
