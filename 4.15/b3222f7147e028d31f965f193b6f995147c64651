gpio: mpc8xxx: Do not reverse bits using bgpio

The MPC8xxx driver is always instantiating its generic GPIO functions
with the flag BGPIOF_BIG_ENDIAN. This means "big-endian bit order"
and means the bits representing the GPIO lines in the registers are
reversed around 31 bits so line 0 is at bit 31 and so forth down to
line 31 in bit 0.

Instead of looping into the generic MMIO gpio to do the simple
calculation of a bitmask, through a vtable call with two parameters
likely using stack frames etc (unless the compiler optimize it)
and obscuring the view for the programmer, let's just open-code
what the call does. This likely executes faster, saves space and
makes the code easier to read.
