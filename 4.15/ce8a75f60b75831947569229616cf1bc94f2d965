net/sched: Change behavior of mq select_queue()

Currently, the class_ops select_queue() implementation on sch_mq
returns a pointer to netdev_queue #0 when it receives and invalid
qdisc id. That can be misleading since all of mq's inner qdiscs are
attached to a valid netdev_queue.

Here we fix that by returning NULL when a qdisc id is invalid. This is
aligned with how select_queue() is implemented for sch_mqprio in the
next patch on this series, keeping a consistent behavior between these
two qdiscs.
