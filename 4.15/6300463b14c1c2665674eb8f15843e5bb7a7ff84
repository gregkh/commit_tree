Btrfs: make plug in writing meta blocks really work

We have started plug in btrfs_write_and_wait_marked_extents() but the
generated IOs actually go to device's schedule IO list where the work
is doing in another task, thus the started plug doesn't make any
sense.

And since we wait for IOs immediately after writing meta blocks, it's
the same case as writing log tree, doing sync submit can merge more
IOs.
