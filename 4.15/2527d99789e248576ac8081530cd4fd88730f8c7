elevator: lookup mq vs non-mq elevators

If an IO scheduler is selected via elevator= and it doesn't match
the driver in question wrt blk-mq support, then we fail to boot.

The elevator= parameter is deprecated and only supported for
non-mq devices. Augment the elevator lookup API so that we
pass in if we're looking for an mq capable scheduler or not,
so that we only ever return a valid type for the queue in
question.
