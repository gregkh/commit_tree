ASoC: Intel: improve DMADEVICES dependency

As pointed out by Pierre-Louis Bossart, the dependency I added
was broader than necessary, only Baytrail and Haswell/Broadwell
actually need it, the others don't.

At the same time, we have individual entries for the codecs
that all have the 'select' statement but now don't need it
any more.
