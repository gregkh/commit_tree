sched/topology: Restore SD_PREFER_SIBLING on MC domains

The normal x86_topology on NHM+ machines degenerates because the MC
and CPU domains are of the same size, therefore MC inherits
SD_PREFER_SIBLING from CPU (which then gets taken out). The result is
that we'll spread tasks across the first NUMA level in order to
maximize cache utilization.

However, for the x86_numa_in_package_topology we loose the CPU domain,
and we'll not have SD_PREFER_SIBLING set anywhere, giving a distinct
difference in behaviour.

Commit:

  8e7fbcbc22c1 ("sched: Remove stale power aware scheduling remnants and dysfunctional knobs")

made a fail by not preserving the SD_PREFER_SIBLING for the !power_saving
case on both CPU and MC.

Then commit:

  6956dc568f34 ("sched/numa: Add SD_PERFER_SIBLING to CPU domain")

adds it back to the CPU but not MC.

Restore that now, such that we get consistent spreading behaviour wrt
L3 and NUMA.
