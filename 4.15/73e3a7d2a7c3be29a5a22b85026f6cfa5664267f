x86/fpu: Remove the explicit clearing of XSAVE dependent features

Clearing a CPU feature with setup_clear_cpu_cap() clears all features
which depend on it. Expressing feature dependencies in one place is
easier to maintain than keeping functions like
fpu__xstate_clear_all_cpu_caps() up to date.

The features which depend on XSAVE have their dependency expressed in the
dependency table, so its sufficient to clear X86_FEATURE_XSAVE.

Remove the explicit clearing of XSAVE dependent features.
