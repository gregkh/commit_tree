l2tp: avoid using ->tunnel_sock for getting session's parent tunnel

Sessions don't need to use l2tp_sock_to_tunnel(xxx->tunnel_sock) for
accessing their parent tunnel. They have the .tunnel field in the
l2tp_session structure for that. Furthermore, in all these cases, the
session is registered, so we're guaranteed that .tunnel isn't NULL and
that the session properly holds a reference on the tunnel.
