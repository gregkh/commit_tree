s390/cmf: avg_utilization

All (but one) cmf related sysfs attributes have been converted to read
directly from the measurement block using cmf_read. This is not
possible for the avg_utilization attribute since this is an aggregation
of several values for which cmf_read only returns average values.

Move the computation of the utilization value to the cmf_read interface
such that it can use the raw data.
