drm/i915: Rename obj->pin_display to obj->pin_global

In the next patch, we want to extend use of the global pin counter for
semi-permanent pinning of context/ring objects. Given that we plan to
extend the usage to encompass a disparate set of objects, we want a name
that reflects both and should entail less confusion.
