ARM: dts: sun8i: h3: Fix node with unit name and no reg property

This patch fixes the warning "xxx has a unit name, but no reg property"
by removing "@0" from such node. 6 board files are fixed. Each has the
same aforementioned issue in pinmux nodes. These include the Nano Pi
family base dtsi file, the Orange Pi 2, Orange Pi Lite, Orange Pi One,
Orange Pi PC, and Orange Pi Plus.
