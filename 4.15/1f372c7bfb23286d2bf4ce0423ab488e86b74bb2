net: ipv6: send NS for DAD when link operationally up

The NS for DAD are sent on admin up as long as a valid qdisc is found.
A race condition exists by which these packets will not egress the
interface if the operational state of the lower device is not yet up.
The solution is to delay DAD until the link is operationally up
according to RFC2863. Rather than only doing this, follow the existing
code checks by deferring IPv6 device initialization altogether. The fix
allows DAD on devices like tunnels that are controlled by userspace
control plane. The fix has no impact on regular deployments, but means
that there is no IPv6 connectivity until the port has been opened in
the case of port-based network access control, which should be
desirable.
