iwlwifi: pcie: fix DMA memory mapping / unmapping

22000 devices (previously referenced as A000) can support
short transmit queues. This means that we have less DMA
descriptors (TFD) for those shorter queues.
Previous devices must still have 256 TFDs for each queue
even if those 256 TFDs point to fewer buffers.

When I introduced support for the short queues for 22000
I broke older devices by assuming that they can also have
less TFDs in their queues. This led to several problems:

1) the payload of the commands weren't unmapped properly
   which caused the SWIOTLB to complain at some point.
2) the hardware could get confused and we get hardware
   crashes.
