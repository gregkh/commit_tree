s390/virtio: remove the old KVM virtio transport

There is no recent user space application available anymore which still
supports this old virtio transport. Additionally, commit 3b2fbb3f06ef
("virtio/s390: deprecate old transport") introduced a deprecation message
in the driver, and apparently nobody complained so far that it is still
required. So let's simply remove it.
