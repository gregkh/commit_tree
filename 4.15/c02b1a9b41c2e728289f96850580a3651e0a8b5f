vfs: grab the lock instead of blocking in __fd_install during resizing

Explicit locking in the fallback case provides a safe state of the
table. Getting rid of blocking semantics makes __fd_install usable
again in non-sleepable contexts, which easies backporting efforts.

There is a side effect of slightly nicer assembly for the common case
as might_sleep can now be removed.
