ext4: remove duplicate extended attributes defs

The following commit:

commit 9b7365fc1c82 ("ext4: add FS_IOC_FSSETXATTR/FS_IOC_FSGETXATTR
interface support")

added several defines related to extended attributes to ext4.h.  They were
added within an #ifndef FS_IOC_FSGETXATTR block with the comment:

/* Until the uapi changes get merged for project quota... */

Those uapi changes were merged by this commit:

commit 334e580a6f97 ("fs: XFS_IOC_FS[SG]SETXATTR to FS_IOC_FS[SG]ETXATTR
promotion")

so all the definitions needed by ext4 are available in
include/uapi/linux/fs.h.  Remove the duplicates from ext4.h.
