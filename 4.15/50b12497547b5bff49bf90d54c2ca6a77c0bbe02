dmaengine: sun6i: Correct setting of clock autogating register for A83T/H3

The H83T uses a compatible string different from the A23, but requires
the same clock autogating register setting.

The H3 also requires setting the clock autogating register, but has
the register at a different offset.

Add three suitable callbacks for the existing controller generations
and set it in the controller config structure.
