xen/pvcalls: implement sendmsg

Send data to an active socket by copying data to the "out" ring. Take
the active socket out_mutex so that only one function can access the
ring at any given time.

If not enough room is available on the ring, rather than returning
immediately or sleep-waiting, spin for up to 5000 cycles. This small
optimization turns out to improve performance significantly.
