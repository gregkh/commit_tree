of: make kobject and bin_attribute support configurable

Having device_nodes be kobjects is only needed if sysfs or OF_DYNAMIC is
enabled. Otherwise, having a kobject in struct device_node is
unnecessary bloat in minimal kernel configurations.

Likewise, bin_attribute is only needed in struct property when sysfs is
enabled, so we can make it configurable too.
