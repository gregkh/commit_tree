clk: samsung: Add explicit MPLL, EPLL clkdev aliases in S3C2443 driver

S3C2443 platform still use non-dt based lookup in some of its drivers
to get MPLL and EPLL clocks. Till now it worked only because PLL()
macro implicitly created aliases for all instantiated clocks. This
feature will be removed, so explicitly create aliases for MPLL and
EPLL clocks.
