ASoC: sun4i-codec: fixed 32bit audio capture support for H3/H2+

32bit and 24bit audio capture formats for H3/H2+ are broken because the
RX_SAMPLE_BITS and the RX_FIFO_MODE bits of AC_ADC_FIFOC register of the audio
codec are not set to operate in 24bit mode but in 16bit mode only.
The following patch sets the H3 audio codec registers and the DMA bus width
properly when a 24/32bit capture is requested.
