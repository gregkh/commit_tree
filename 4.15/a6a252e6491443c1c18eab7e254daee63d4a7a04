blk-mq-sched: decide how to handle flush rq via RQF_FLUSH_SEQ

In case of IO scheduler we always pre-allocate one driver tag before
calling blk_insert_flush(), and flush request will be marked as
RQF_FLUSH_SEQ once it is in flush machinery.

So if RQF_FLUSH_SEQ isn't set, we call blk_insert_flush() to handle
the request, otherwise the flush request is dispatched to ->dispatch
list directly.

This is a preparation patch for not preallocating a driver tag for flush
requests, and for not treating flush requests as a special case. This is
similar to what the legacy path does.
