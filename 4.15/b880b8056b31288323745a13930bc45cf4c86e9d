ASoC: fsl_ssi: serialize AC'97 register access operations

AC'97 register access operations (both read and write) on SSI use a one,
shared set of SSI registers for AC'97 register address and data.
This means that only one such access is possible at a time and so all these
operations need to be serialized.

Since an AC'97 register access operation in this driver takes 100us+ let's
use a mutex for this.

Use this opportunity to also change a default value returned from AC'97
register read function from -1 to 0, since that's what AC'97 specs require
to be returned when unknown / undefined registers are read.
