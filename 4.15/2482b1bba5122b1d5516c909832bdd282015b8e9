tpm: Trigger only missing TPM 2.0 self tests

tpm2_do_selftest is only used during initialization of the TPM to ensure
that the device functions correctly. Therefore, it is sufficient to request
only missing self tests (parameter full_test=0), not a reexecution of all
self tests, as was done before. This allows for a faster execution of this
command.
