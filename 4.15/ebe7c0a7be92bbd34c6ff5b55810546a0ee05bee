ima: fix hash algorithm initialization

The hash_setup function always sets the hash_setup_done flag, even
when the hash algorithm is invalid.  This prevents the default hash
algorithm defined as CONFIG_IMA_DEFAULT_HASH from being used.

This patch sets hash_setup_done flag only for valid hash algorithms.
