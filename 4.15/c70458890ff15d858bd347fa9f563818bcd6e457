ASoC: img-parallel-out: Add pm_runtime_get/put to set_fmt callback

Add pm_runtime_get_sync and pm_runtime_put calls to set_fmt callback
function. This fixes a bus error during boot when CONFIG_SUSPEND is
defined when this function gets called while the device is runtime
disabled and device registers are accessed while the clock is disabled.
