powerpc/watchdog: Do not trigger SMP crash from touch_nmi_watchdog

In xmon, touch_nmi_watchdog() is not expected to be checking that
other CPUs have not touched the watchdog, so the code will just call
touch_nmi_watchdog() once before re-enabling hard interrupts.

Just update our CPU's state, and ignore apparently stuck SMP threads.

Arguably touch_nmi_watchdog should check for SMP lockups, and callers
should be fixed, but that's not trivial for the input code of xmon.
