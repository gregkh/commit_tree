HID: sony: Fix SHANWAN pad rumbling on USB

The SHANWAN PS3 clone joypad will start its rumble motors as soon as
it is plugged in via USB. As the additional USB interrupt does nothing on
the original PS3 Sixaxis joypads, and makes a number of other
clone joypads actually start sending data, disable that call for
the SHANWAN so the rumble motors aren't started on plug.
