btrfs: allow setting zlib compression level via :9

This is bikeshedding, but it seems people are drastically more likely to
understand "zlib:9" as compression level rather than an algorithm
version compared to "zlib9".

Based on feedback on the mailinglist, the ":9" will be the only accepted
syntax. The level must be a single digit. Unrecognized format will
result to the default, for forward compatibility in a similar way the
compression algorithm specifier was relaxed in commit
a7164fa4e055daf6368c ("btrfs: prepare for extensions in compression
options").
