media: gspca: remove redundant assignment to variable j

Variable j is being set to zero before a loop and also
immediately inside the loop and is not used after the loop.
Hence the first assignment is redundant and can be removed.
Cleans up clang warning:

drivers/media/usb/gspca/gspca.c:1078:2: warning: Value stored
to 'j' is never read
