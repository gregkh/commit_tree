gpu: host1x: Enable Tegra186 syncpoint protection

Since Tegra186 the Host1x hardware allows syncpoints to be assigned to
specific channels, preventing any other channels from incrementing
them.

Enable this feature where available and assign syncpoints to channels
when submitting a job. Syncpoints are currently never unassigned from
channels since that would require extra work and is unnecessary with
the current channel allocation model.
