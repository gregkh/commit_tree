ARM: head-common.S: speed up startup code

Let's use optimized routines such as memcpy to copy .data and memzero
to clear .bss in the startup code instead of doing it one word at a
time. Those routines don't use any global data so they're safe to use
even if .data and .bss segments are not initialized.

In the .data copy case a temporary stack is installed in the .bss area
as the actual kernel stack is located within the copied data area. The
XIP kernel linker script ensures a 8 byte alignment for that purpose.

Finally, make the .data copy and related pointers surrounded by
CONFIG_XIP_KERNEL to make it obvious what it is all about. This will
allow for further cleanups in the non-XIP linker script.
