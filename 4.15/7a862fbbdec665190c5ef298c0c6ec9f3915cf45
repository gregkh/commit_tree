brd: remove dax support

DAX support in brd is awkward because its backing page frames are
distinct from the ones provided by pmem, dcssblk, or axonram. We need
pfn_t_devmap() entries to fully support DAX, and the limited DAX support
for pfn_t_special() page frames is not interesting for brd when pmem is
already a superset of brd.  Lastly, brd is the only dax capable driver
that may sleep in its ->direct_access() implementation. So it causes a
global burden with no net gain of kernel functionality.

For all these reasons, remove DAX support.
