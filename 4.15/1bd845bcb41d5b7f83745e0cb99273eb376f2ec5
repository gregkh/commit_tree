padata: set cpu_index of unused CPUs to -1

The parallel queue per-cpu data structure gets initialized only for CPUs
in the 'pcpu' CPU mask set. This is not sufficient as the reorder timer
may run on a different CPU and might wrongly decide it's the target CPU
for the next reorder item as per-cpu memory gets memset(0) and we might
be waiting for the first CPU in cpumask.pcpu, i.e. cpu_index 0.

Make the '__this_cpu_read(pd->pqueue->cpu_index) == next_queue->cpu_index'
compare in padata_get_next() fail in this case by initializing the
cpu_index member of all per-cpu parallel queues. Use -1 for unused ones.
