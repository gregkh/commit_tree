net: bridge: Send notification when host join/leaves a group

The host can join or leave a multicast group on the brX interface, as
indicated by IGMP snooping.  This is tracked within the bridge
multicast code. Send a notification when this happens, in the same way
a notification is sent when a port of the bridge joins/leaves a group
because of IGMP snooping.
