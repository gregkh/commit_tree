locking/core: Remove {read,spin,write}_can_lock()

Outside of the locking code itself, {read,spin,write}_can_lock() have no
users in tree. Apparmor (the last remaining user of write_can_lock()) got
moved over to lockdep by the previous patch.

This patch removes the use of {read,spin,write}_can_lock() from the
BUILD_LOCK_OPS macro, deferring to the trylock operation for testing the
lock status, and subsequently removes the unused macros altogether. They
aren't guaranteed to work in a concurrent environment and can give
incorrect results in the case of qrwlock.
