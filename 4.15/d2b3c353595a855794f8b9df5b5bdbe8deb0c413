pinctrl: cherryview: Mask all interrupts on Intel_Strago based systems

Guenter Roeck reported an interrupt storm on a prototype system which is
based on Cyan Chromebook. The root cause turned out to be a incorrectly
configured pin that triggers spurious interrupts. This will be fixed in
coreboot but currently we need to prevent the interrupt storm from
happening by masking all interrupts (but not GPEs) on those systems.
