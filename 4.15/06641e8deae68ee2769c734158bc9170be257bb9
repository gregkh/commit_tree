sdhci-fujitsu: add support for setting the CMD_DAT_DELAY attribute

The Socionext SynQuacer SoC inherits this IP from Fujitsu, but
requires the F_SDH30_CMD_DAT_DELAY bit to be set in the
F_SDH30_ESD_CONTROL control register. So set this bit if the
DT node has the 'fujitsu,cmd-dat-delay-select' property.
