i40e: refactor FW version checking

The i40e driver now supports two different devices with two different
firmware versions. So be smart about how we handle these. Move the FW
version macros to the appropriate header file, and add a convenience
macro that checks the version based on the device. Then use this macro
to check whether or not the driver can use the new link info API.
