nfp: bpf: add support for direct packet access - read

In direct packet access bound checks are already done, we can
simply dereference the packet pointer.

Verifier/parser logic needs to record pointer type.  Note that
although verifier does protect us from CTX vs other pointer
changes we will also want to differentiate between PACKET vs
MAP_VALUE or STACK, so we can add the check already.
