net: dsa: change dsa_ptr for a dsa_port

With DSA, a master net device (CPU facing interface) has a dsa_ptr
pointer to which hangs a dsa_switch_tree. This is not correct because a
master interface is wired to a dedicated switch port, and because we can
theoretically have several master interfaces pointing to several CPU
ports of the same switch fabric.

Change the master interface's dsa_ptr for the CPU dsa_port pointer.
This is a step towards supporting multiple CPU ports.
