liquidio: pass date and time info to NIC firmware

Pass date and time information to NIC at the time of loading
firmware and periodically update the host time to NIC firmware.
This is to make NIC firmware use the same time reference as Host,
so that it is easy to correlate logs from firmware and host for debugging.
