Bluetooth: btbcm: Add entry for BCM4356A2 UART bluetooth

This patch adds the device ID for the bluetooth chip used in the
Broadcom BCM4356 PCI-E WiFi / UART BT chip.

Successfully tested using Firmware version 0273

The upper nibble of the rev field is 2 on this device, so this commit
also adds handling of 2 to the switch-case done on the upper nibble.
