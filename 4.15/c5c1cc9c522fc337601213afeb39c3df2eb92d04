smc: add SMC rendezvous protocol

The SMC protocol [1] uses a rendezvous protocol to negotiate SMC
capability between peers. The current Linux implementation does not yet
use this rendezvous protocol and, thus, is not compliant to RFC7609 and
incompatible with other SMC implementations like in zOS.
This patch adds support for the SMC rendezvous protocol. It uses a new
TCP experimental option. With this option, SMC capabilities are
exchanged between the peers during the TCP three way handshake.
