rxrpc: Support service upgrade from a kernel service

Provide support for a kernel service to make use of the service upgrade
facility.  This involves:

 (1) Pass an upgrade request flag to rxrpc_kernel_begin_call().

 (2) Make rxrpc_kernel_recv_data() return the call's current service ID so
     that the caller can detect service upgrade and see what the service
     was upgraded to.
