media: tegra-cec: add Tegra HDMI CEC driver

This driver adds support for the Tegra CEC IP. It is based on the
NVIDIA drivers/misc/tegra-cec driver in their 3.10 kernel.

This has been converted to the CEC framework and cleaned up.

Tested with my Jetson TK1 board. It has also been tested with the
Tegra X1 in an embedded product.

Note of warning for the Tegra X2: this SoC supports two HDMI outputs,
but only one CEC adapter and the CEC bus is shared between the
two outputs. This is a design mistake and the CEC adapter can
control only one HDMI output. Never hook up both HDMI outputs
to the CEC bus in a hardware design: this is illegal as per the
CEC specification.

The CEC bus can be shared between multiple inputs and zero or one
outputs, but not between multiple outputs.
