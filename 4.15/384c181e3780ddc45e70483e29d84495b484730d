net: sched: Identify hardware traffic classes using classid

This patch offloads the classid to hardware and uses the classid
reserved in the range :ffe0 - :ffef to identify hardware traffic
classes reported via dev->num_tc.

tcf_result structure contains the class ID of the class to which
the packet belongs and is offloaded to hardware via flower filter.
A new helper function is introduced to represent HW traffic
classes 0 through 15 using the reserved classid values :ffe0 - :ffef.
