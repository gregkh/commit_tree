powerpc/perf: Fix IMC_MAX_PMU macro

IMC_MAX_PMU is used for static storage (per_nest_pmu_arr) which holds
nest pmu information. Current value for the macro is 32 based on
the initial number of nest pmu units supported by the nest microcode.
But going forward, microcode could support more nest units. Instead
of static storage, patch to fix the code to dynamically allocate an
array based on the number of nest imc units found in the device tree.
