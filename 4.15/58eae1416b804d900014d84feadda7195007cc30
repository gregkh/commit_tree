ssb: Disable PCI host for PCI_DRIVERS_GENERIC

Since commit d41e6858ba58 ("MIPS: Kconfig: Set default MIPS system type
as generic") changed the default MIPS platform to the "generic"
platform, which uses PCI_DRIVERS_GENERIC instead of PCI_DRIVERS_LEGACY,
various files in drivers/ssb/ have failed to build.

This is particularly due to the existence of struct pci_controller being
dependent on PCI_DRIVERS_LEGACY since commit c5611df96804 ("MIPS: PCI:
Introduce CONFIG_PCI_DRIVERS_LEGACY"), so add that dependency to Kconfig
to prevent these files being built for the "generic" platform including
all{yes,mod}config builds.
