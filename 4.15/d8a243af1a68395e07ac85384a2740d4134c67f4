can: peak: fix potential bug in packet fragmentation

In some rare conditions when running one PEAK USB-FD interface over
a non high-speed USB controller, one useless USB fragment might be sent.
This patch fixes the way a USB command is fragmented when its length is
greater than 64 bytes and when the underlying USB controller is not a
high-speed one.
