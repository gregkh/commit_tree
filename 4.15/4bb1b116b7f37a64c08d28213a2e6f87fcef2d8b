net: sched: move block offload unbind after all chains are flushed

Currently, the offload unbind is done before the chains are flushed.
That causes driver to unregister block callback before it can get all
the callback calls done during flush, leaving the offloaded tps inside
the HW. So fix the order to prevent this situation and restore the
original behaviour.
