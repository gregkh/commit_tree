mlxsw: spectrum_router: Generalize __mlxsw_sp_ipip_entry_update_tunnel()

The work that needs to be done to update HW configuration in response to
changes is similar to what __mlxsw_sp_ipip_entry_update_tunnel() already
does, but with a number of twists: each change requires a different
subset of things to happen. Extend the function to support all these
uses, and allow finely-grained configuration of what should happen at
each call through a suite of function arguments.

Publish the updated function to allow use from the spectrum_ipip module.
