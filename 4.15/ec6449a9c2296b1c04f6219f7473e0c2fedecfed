KVM: arm/arm64: Don't enable/disable physical timer access on VHE

After the timer optimization rework we accidentally end up calling
physical timer enable/disable functions on VHE systems, which is neither
needed nor correct, since the CNTHCTL_EL2 register format is
different when HCR_EL2.E2H is set.

The CNTHCTL_EL2 is initialized when CPUs become online in
kvm_timer_init_vhe() and we don't have to call these functions on VHE
systems, which also allows us to inline the non-VHE functionality.
