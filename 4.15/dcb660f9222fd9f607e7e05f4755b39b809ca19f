xfs: probe the scrub ioctl

Create a probe scrubber with id 0.  This will be used by xfs_scrub to
probe the kernel's abilities to scrub (and repair) the metadata.  We do
this by validating the ioctl inputs from userspace, preparing the
filesystem for a scrub (or a repair) operation, and immediately
returning to userspace.  Userspace can use the returned errno and
structure state to decide (in broad terms) if scrub/repair are
supported by the running kernel.
