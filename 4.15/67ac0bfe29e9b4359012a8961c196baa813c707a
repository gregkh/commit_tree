powerpc/kprobes: Blacklist emulate_update_regs() from kprobes

Commit 3cdfcbfd32b9d ("powerpc: Change analyse_instr so it doesn't
modify *regs") introduced emulate_update_regs() to perform part of what
emulate_step() was doing earlier. However, this function was not added
to the kprobes blacklist. Add it so as to prevent it from being probed.
