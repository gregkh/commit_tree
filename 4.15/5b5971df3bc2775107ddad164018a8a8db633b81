xen-netfront: remove warning when unloading module

v2:
 * Replace busy wait with wait_event()/wake_up_all()
 * Cannot garantee that at the time xennet_remove is called, the
   xen_netback state will not be XenbusStateClosed, so added a
   condition for that
 * There's a small chance for the xen_netback state is
   XenbusStateUnknown by the time the xen_netfront switches to Closed,
   so added a condition for that.

When unloading module xen_netfront from guest, dmesg would output
warning messages like below:

  [  105.236836] xen:grant_table: WARNING: g.e. 0x903 still in use!
  [  105.236839] deferring g.e. 0x903 (pfn 0x35805)

This problem relies on netfront and netback being out of sync. By the time
netfront revokes the g.e.'s netback didn't have enough time to free all of
them, hence displaying the warnings on dmesg.

The trick here is to make netfront to wait until netback frees all the g.e.'s
and only then continue to cleanup for the module removal, and this is done by
manipulating both device states.
