ARM: davinci_all_defconfig: enable MTD_CMDLINE_PARTS

There is some disagreement between the partition table map in Linux
for the DA850-EVM and the corresponding partition map in U-Boot.
To prevent breaking the Kernel, this patch enables MTD_CMDLINE_PARTS
which will allow the U-Boot to pass the partition map so future partitions
match without breaking backwards compatibility.

While at it, also sync to savedefconfig which leads to removal of
CONFIG_MMC_BLOCK_BOUNCE.
