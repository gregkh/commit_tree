drm/amd/display: Fix ASSR enablement on DP to EDP converter

ASSR mode is not enable when we connect eDP panel via DP to eDP converter.
connector_signal is coming as SIGNAL_TYPE_DISPLAY_PORT. Present code
ignoring panel_mode_edp for SIGNAL_TYPE_DISPLAY_PORT. Added checking
panel_mode_edp for all signals.
