autofs: revert "autofs: fix AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT not being honored"

Commit 42f461482178 ("autofs: fix AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT not being honored")
allowed the fstatat(2) system call to properly honor the AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT
flag but introduced a semantic change.

In order to honor AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT a semantic change was made to the
negative dentry case for stat family system calls in follow_automount().

This changed the unconditional triggering of an automount in this case
to no longer be done and an error returned instead.

This has caused more problems than I expected so reverting the change is
needed.

In a discussion with Neil Brown it was concluded that the automount(8)
daemon can implement this change without kernel modifications.  So that
will be done instead and the autofs module documentation updated with a
description of the problem and what needs to be done by module users for
this specific case.
