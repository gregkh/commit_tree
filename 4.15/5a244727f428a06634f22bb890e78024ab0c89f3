isa: Prevent NULL dereference in isa_bus driver callbacks

The isa_driver structure for an isa_bus device is stored in the device
platform_data member of the respective device structure. This
platform_data member may be reset to NULL if isa_driver match callback
for the device fails, indicating a device unsupported by the ISA driver.

This patch fixes a possible NULL pointer dereference if one of the
isa_driver callbacks to attempted for an unsupported device. This error
should not occur in practice since ISA devices are typically manually
configured and loaded by the users, but we may as well prevent this
error from popping up for the 0day testers.
