mm, page_alloc: fix potential false positive in __zone_watermark_ok

Since commit 97a16fc82a7c ("mm, page_alloc: only enforce watermarks for
order-0 allocations"), __zone_watermark_ok() check for high-order
allocations will shortcut per-migratetype free list checks for
ALLOC_HARDER allocations, and return true as long as there's free page
of any migratetype.  The intention is that ALLOC_HARDER can allocate
from MIGRATE_HIGHATOMIC free lists, while normal allocations can't.

However, as a side effect, the watermark check will then also return
true when there are pages only on the MIGRATE_ISOLATE list, or (prior to
CMA conversion to ZONE_MOVABLE) on the MIGRATE_CMA list.  Since the
allocation cannot actually obtain isolated pages, and might not be able
to obtain CMA pages, this can result in a false positive.

The condition should be rare and perhaps the outcome is not a fatal one.
Still, it's better if the watermark check is correct.  There also
shouldn't be a performance tradeoff here.
