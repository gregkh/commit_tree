mfd: Fix RTS5227 (and others) powermanagement

Commit 8275b77a1513 ("mfd: rts5249: Add support for RTS5250S power
saving") adds powersaving support for device-ids 5249 524a and 525a.

But as a side effect it breaks ASPM support for all the other device-ids,
causing e.g. the Haswell CPU on a Lenovo T440s to not go into a higher
c-state then PC3, while previously it would go to PC7, causing the
machine to idle at 7.4W instead of 6.6W!

The problem here is the new option.dev_aspm_mode field, which only gets
explicitly initialized in the new code for the device-ids 5249 524a and
525a. Leaving the dev_aspm_mode 0 for the other device-ids.

The default dev_aspm_mode 0 is mapped to DEV_ASPM_DISABLE, but the
old behavior of calling rtsx_pci_enable_aspm() when idle and
rtsx_pci_disable_aspm() when busy happens when dev_aspm_mode ==
DEV_ASPM_DYNAMIC.

This commit changes the enum so that 0 = DEV_ASPM_DYNAMIC matching the
old default behavior, fixing the pm regression with the other device-ids.
