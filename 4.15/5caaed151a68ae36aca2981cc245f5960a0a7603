netfilter: conntrack: don't cache nlattr_tuple_size result in nla_size

We currently call ->nlattr_tuple_size() once at register time and
cache result in l4proto->nla_size.

nla_size is the only member that is written to, avoiding this would
allow to make l4proto trackers const.

We can use ->nlattr_tuple_size() at run time, and cache result in
the individual trackers instead.

This is an intermediate step, next patch removes nlattr_size()
callback and computes size at compile time, then removes nla_size.
