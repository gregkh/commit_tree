arm64: entry.S: move SError handling into a C function for future expansion

Today SError is taken using the inv_entry macro that ends up in
bad_mode.

SError can be used by the RAS Extensions to notify either the OS or
firmware of CPU problems, some of which may have been corrected.

To allow this handling to be added, add a do_serror() C function
that just panic()s. Add the entry.S boiler plate to save/restore the
CPU registers and unmask debug exceptions. Future patches may change
do_serror() to return if the SError Interrupt was notification of a
corrected error.
