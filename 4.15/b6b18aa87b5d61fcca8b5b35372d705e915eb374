mm, soft_offline: improve hugepage soft offlining error log

On a failed attempt, we get the following entry: soft offline: 0x3c0000:
migration failed 1, type 17ffffc0008008 (uptodate|head)

Make this more specific to be straightforward and to follow other error
log formats in soft_offline_huge_page().
