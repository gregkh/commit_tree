i40e/i40evf: organize and re-number feature flags

Now that we've reduced the number of flags, organize similar flags
together and re-number them accordingly.

Since we don't yet have more than 32 flags, we'll use a u32 for both the
hw_features and flag field. Should we gain more flags in the future, we
may need to convert to a u64 or separate flags out into two fields.

One alternative approach considered, but not implemented here, was to
use an enumeration for the flag variables, and create a macro
I40E_FLAG() which used string concatenation to generate BIT_ULL values.
This has the advantage of making the actual bit values compile-time
dynamic so that we do not need to worry about matching the order to the
bit value. However, this does produce a high level of code churn, and
makes it more difficult to read a dumped flags value when debugging.
