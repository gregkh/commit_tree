ASoC: snd_soc_component_driver has endianness

Codec will be replaced into Component, then Codec side only
needs to call fixup_codec_formats() at this point.

This patch adds new endianness flag on Component driver
and call convert_endianness_formats() (= was fixup_codec_format())
if endianness was true.

When Codec is replaced into Component, Codec driver needs
to have endianness = 1 flags.
Existing CPU side of course doesn't have this flag, thus CPU doesn't
call it.
