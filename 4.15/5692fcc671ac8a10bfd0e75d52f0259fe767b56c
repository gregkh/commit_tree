doc: Rewrite confusing statement about memory barriers

The "Write (or store) memory barriers" bullet of the "Variety of memory
barriers" section, calls out a sequential order of stores, which is
confusing since sequential ordering is not guaranteed.

This commit therefore rewords to avoid mentioning a sequence of stores
to clarify the intent.
