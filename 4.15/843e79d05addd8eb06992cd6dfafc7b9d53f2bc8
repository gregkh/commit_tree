net: sched: make tc_action_ops->get_dev return dev and avoid passing net

Return dev directly, NULL if not possible. That is enough.

Makes no sense to pass struct net * to get_dev op, as there is only one
net possible, the one the action was created in. So just store it in
mirred priv and use directly.

Rename the mirred op callback function.
