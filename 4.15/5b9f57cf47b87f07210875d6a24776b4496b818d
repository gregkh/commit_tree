apparmor: fix regression in mount mediation when feature set is pinned

When the mount code was refactored for Labels it was not correctly
updated to check whether policy supported mediation of the mount
class.  This causes a regression when the kernel feature set is
reported as supporting mount and policy is pinned to a feature set
that does not support mount mediation.
