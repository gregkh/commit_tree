drm/amd/display: Move power control from link encoder to hwsequencer

A recent commit moved the backlight control code along with the register
defines, but did not move the power control code. This along with
remnant fields in the dce110_link_enc_registers struct made it so that
the code still compiled, but any attempts to access the
LVTMA_PWRSEQ_STATE register led to reading from an address of 0. This
patch corrects that.

Also, rename blacklight_control to edp_backlight_control (Typo fix).
