i40e: fix clearing link masks in i40e_get_link_ksettings

This fixes two issues in i40e_get_link_ksettings.  It adds calls to
ethtool_link_ksettings_zero_link_mode to make sure advertising and
supported link masks are cleared before we start setting bits in them.

This also replaces some funky bit manipulations with a much nicer call
to ethtool_link_ksettings_del_link_mode when removing link modes.
