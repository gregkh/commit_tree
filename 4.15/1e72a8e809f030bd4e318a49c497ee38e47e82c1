dm cache policy smq: handle races with queuing background_work

The background_tracker holds a set of promotions/demotions that the
cache policy wishes the core target to implement.

When adding a new operation to the tracker it's possible that an
operation on the same block is already present (but in practise this
doesn't appear to be happening).  Catch these situations and do the
appropriate cleanup.
