thermal/drivers/hisi: Remove mutex_lock in the code

The mutex is used to protect against writes in the configuration register.

That happens at probe time, with no possible race yet.

Then when the module is unloaded and at suspend/resume.

When the module is unloaded, it is an userspace operation, thus via a process.
Suspending the system goes through the freezer to suspend all the tasks
synchronously before continuing. So it is not possible to hit the suspend ops
in this driver while we are unloading it.

The resume is the same situation than the probe.

In other words, even if there are several places where we write the
configuration register, there is no situation where we can write it at the same
time, so far as I can judge
