MIPS: Guard against any partial write attempt with PTRACE_SETREGSET

Complement commit d614fd58a283 ("mips/ptrace: Preserve previous
registers for short regset write") and ensure that no partial register
write attempt is made with PTRACE_SETREGSET, as we do not preinitialize
any temporaries used to hold incoming register data and consequently
random data could be written.

It is the responsibility of the caller, such as `ptrace_regset', to
arrange for writes to span whole registers only, so here we only assert
that it has indeed happened.
