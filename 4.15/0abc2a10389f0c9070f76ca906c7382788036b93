block: fix blk_rq_append_bio

Commit caa4b02476e3(blk-map: call blk_queue_bounce from blk_rq_append_bio)
moves blk_queue_bounce() into blk_rq_append_bio(), but don't consider
the fact that the bounced bio becomes invisible to caller since the
parameter type is 'struct bio *'. Make it a pointer to a pointer to
a bio, so the caller sees the right bio also after a bounce.

(handling failure of blk_rq_append_bio(), only call bio_get() after
blk_rq_append_bio() returns OK)
