ocfs2: fix cluster hang after a node dies

When a node dies, other live nodes have to choose a new master for an
existed lock resource mastered by the dead node.

As for ocfs2/dlm implementation, this is done by function -
dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list which marks those lock rsources as
DLM_LOCK_RES_RECOVERING and manages them via a list from which DLM
changes lock resource's master later.

So without invoking dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list, no master will be
choosed after dlm recovery accomplishment since no lock resource can be
found through ::resource list.

What's worse is that if DLM_LOCK_RES_RECOVERING is not marked for lock
resources mastered a dead node, it will break up synchronization among
nodes.

So invoke dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list again.
