drm/amd/display: disconnect on HPD low even if edid is the same

[Description]
There are many occasions we need to retrieve sink capability and
notify connectivity change to os even if edid is not changed
on a HPD toggle.
(HDMI2.0 display needs re-enable link on every hpd,
display changes other capability outside from edid
 need to be queried again and possibly reset the mode, etc.)

In these cases we cannot keep the same sink without letting DM know.
