tracing, thermal: Hide cpu cooling trace events when not in use

As trace events when defined create data structures and functions to
process them, defining trace events when not using them is a waste of
memory.

The trace events thermal_power_cpu_get_power and
thermal_power_cpu_limit are only used when CONFIG_CPU_THERMAL is set.
Make those events only defined when that is set as well.
