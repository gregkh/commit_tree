mm/shmem: introduce shmem_file_setup_with_mnt

We are planning to use our own tmpfs mnt in i915 in place of the
shm_mnt, such that we can control the mount options, in particular
huge=, which we require to support huge-gtt-pages. So rather than roll
our own version of __shmem_file_setup, it would be preferred if we could
just give shmem our mnt, and let it do the rest.
