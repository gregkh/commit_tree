ASoC: da7213: add support for DSP modes

DSP modes are documented in the data sheet but not enabled in the driver.
The work-around already implemented for DA7218/9 is also required to
make sure the bit clock handling in DSP modes follows ASoC conventions.

Tested with ARD-AUDIO-DA7212 and Minnowmax Turbot boards
