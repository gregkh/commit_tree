hv_netvsc: preserve hw_features on mtu/channels/ringparam changes

rndis_filter_device_add() is called both from netvsc_probe() when we
initially create the device and from set channels/mtu/ringparam
routines where we basically remove the device and add it back.

hw_features is reset in rndis_filter_device_add() and filled with
host data. However, we lose all additional flags which are set outside
of the driver, e.g. register_netdevice() adds NETIF_F_SOFT_FEATURES and
many others.

Unfortunately, calls to rndis_{query_hwcaps(), _set_offload_params()}
calls cannot be avoided on every RNDIS reset: host expects us to set
required features explicitly. Moreover, in theory hardware capabilities
can change and we need to reflect the change in hw_features.

Reset net->hw_features bits according to host data in
rndis_netdev_set_hwcaps(), clear corresponding feature bits
from net->features in case some features went missing (will never happen
in real life I guess but let's be consistent).
