of: overlay: loosen overly strict phandle clash check

When an overlay contains a node that already exists in
the live device tree, the overlay node is not allowed
to change the phandle of the existing node.

The existing check refused to allow an overlay node to
set the node phandle even when the existing node did
not have a phandle.  Relax the check to allow an
overlay node to set the phandle value if the existing
node does not have a phandle.
