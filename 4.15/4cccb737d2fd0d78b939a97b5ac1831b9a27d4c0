mlxsw: spectrum: Drop refcounting of IPIP entries

Formerly, IPIP entries were created lazily by next hops that referenced
an offloadable IP-in-IP netdevice. However now that they are created
eagerly as a reaction to events on such netdevices, the reference
counting is useless. Hence drop it.

The routes whose next hops reference an offloaded IP-in-IP netdevice
actually linger around a bit after their device is unregistered.
However, mlxsw_sp_ipip_entry_destroy() also destroys the backing
loopback, and mlxsw_sp_rif_destroy() transitively (via
mlxsw_sp_nexthop_rif_gone_sync()) calls mlxsw_sp_nexthop_ipip_fini(),
which unlinks the IPIP entry from a next hop. Thus no dangling pointers
are left behind for the brief window after netdevice is gone, but routes
not yet.
