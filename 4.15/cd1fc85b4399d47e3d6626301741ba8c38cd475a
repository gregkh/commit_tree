tcp: always evaluate losses in RACK upon undo

When sender detects spurious retransmission, all packets
marked lost are remarked to be in-flight. However some may
be considered lost based on its timestamps in RACK. This patch
forces RACK to re-evaluate, which may be skipped previously if
the ACK does not advance RACK timestamp.
