fbcon: Initialize ops->info early

During console takeover, which happens for all DRM/KMS setups using the
fbdev helpers, fbcon_startup() is called before fbcon_init() and as a
result con2fb_acquire_newinfo() will not be called (info->fbcon_par was
set to non-NULL in fbcon_startup()) to assign ops->info.

This causes the cursor_timer_handler() to unreference a NULL pointer.

Avoid this by unconditionally assigning ops->info during fbcon_startup()
so that it will be available early, but keep the additional assignment
in con2fb_acquire_newinfo() to support console remapping at runtime.
