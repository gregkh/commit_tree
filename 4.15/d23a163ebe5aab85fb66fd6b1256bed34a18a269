ARM: dts: Add nodes for missing omap4 interconnect target modules

On omap4 we are missing dts nodes for several interconnect target
modules that we are idling on init. This currently works with the
legacy platform data still around.

To fix this, let's add the interconnect target modules so we can
idle the unused interconnect target module on init.

Also note that adding the interconnect target module node does not
necessarily mean that there is a driver available for the child IP
block, or that the child IP block is even functional.

In the SGX case, the PowerVR driver is closed source. And McASP on
omap4 has at least the TX path disabled and is not supported by the
davinci-mcasp driver. For AESS there is old Android 3.4 kernel
driver available.

For smarflex, we are still probing with platform data and the
driver needs more work before we can add the device ip child nodes.

And finally, we're not yet using the interconnet ranges. I will
be posting separate patches for those later on.
