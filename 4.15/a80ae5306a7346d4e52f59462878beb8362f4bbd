tipc: improve destination linked list

We often see a need for a linked list of destination identities,
sometimes containing a port number, sometimes a node identity, and
sometimes both. The currently defined struct u32_list is not generic
enough to cover all cases, so we extend it to contain two u32 integers
and rename it to struct tipc_dest_list.
