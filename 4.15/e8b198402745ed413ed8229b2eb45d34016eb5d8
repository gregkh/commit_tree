iommu/iova: Try harder to allocate from rcache magazine

When devices with different DMA masks are using the same domain, or for
PCI devices where we usually try a speculative 32-bit allocation first,
there is a fair possibility that the top PFN of the rcache stack at any
given time may be unsuitable for the lower limit, prompting a fallback
to allocating anew from the rbtree. Consequently, we may end up
artifically increasing pressure on the 32-bit IOVA space as unused IOVAs
accumulate lower down in the rcache stacks, while callers with 32-bit
masks also impose unnecessary rbtree overhead.

In such cases, let's try a bit harder to satisfy the allocation locally
first - scanning the whole stack should still be relatively inexpensive.
