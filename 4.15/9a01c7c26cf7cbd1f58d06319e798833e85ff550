thunderbolt: Allocate ring HopID automatically if requested

Thunderbolt services should not care which HopID (ring) they use for
sending and receiving packets over the high-speed DMA path, so make
tb_ring_alloc_rx() and tb_ring_alloc_tx() accept negative HopID. This
means that the NHI will allocate next available HopID for the caller
automatically.

These HopIDs will be allocated from the range which is not reserved for
the Thunderbolt protocol (8 .. hop_count - 1).

The allocated HopID can be retrieved from ring->hop field after the ring
has been allocated successfully if needed.
