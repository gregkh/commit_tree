fsnotify: clean up fsnotify()

Use helpers to get first and next marks from connector.

Also get rid of inode_node/vfsmount_node local variables, which just refers
to the same objects as iter_info.  There was an srcu_dereference() for
foo_node, but that's completely superfluous since we've already done it
when obtaining foo_node.

Also get rid of inode_group/vfsmount_group local variables; checking
against non-NULL for these is the same as checking against non-NULL
inode_mark/vfsmount_mark.
