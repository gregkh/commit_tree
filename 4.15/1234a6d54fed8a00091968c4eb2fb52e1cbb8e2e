scsi: lpfc: Fix crash receiving ELS while detaching driver

The driver crashes when attempting to use a freed ndpl pointer.

The pci_remove_one handler runs on a separate kernel thread. The order
of the removal is starting by freeing all of the ndlps and then
disabling interrupts. In between these two events the driver can still
receive an ELS and process it. When it tries to use the ndlp pointer
will be NULL

Change the order of the pci_remove_one vs disable interrupts so that
interrupts are disabled before the ndlp's are freed.
