tipc: fix broken tipc_poll() function

In commit ae236fb208a6 ("tipc: receive group membership events via
member socket") we broke the tipc_poll() function by checking the
state of the receive queue before the call to poll_sock_wait(), while
relying that state afterwards, when it might have changed.

We restore this in this commit.
