drm/i915: Set our shrinker->batch to 4096 (~16MiB)

Prefer to defer activating our GEM shrinker until we have a few
megabytes to free; or we have accumulated sufficient mempressure by
deferring the reclaim to force a shrink. The intent is that because our
objects may typically be large, we are too effective at shrinking and
are not rewarded for freeing more pages than the batch. It will also
defer the initial shrinking to hopefully put it at a lower priority than
say the buffer cache (although it will balance out over a number of
reclaims, with GEM being more bursty).

v2: Give it a feedback system to try and tune the batch size towards
an effective size for the available objects.
v3: Start keeping track of shrinker stats in debugfs
v4: Protect against finding no shrinkable objects (div-by-zero)
