net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Set correct CHAIN_ID and slice number mask

When configuring an IPv6 address mask, we should use SLICE_NUM_MASK as
the mask in order to make sure all bits are masked by the hardware.
Also, we want matching entries to have a CHAIN_ID value set to the same
value as the rule index we return to user-space for convenience, so fix
that too.
