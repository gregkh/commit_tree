drm/doc: Document ioctl errno value patterns

We're not super-consistent about these, but I think it's worth to
document at least the commmon patterns.

v2:
- Add a not about ENOTTY (it's just a confusing name, but used
exactly what it's meant for in DRM) (Chris).
- Unconfuse the text for ENODEV (Daniel)
- Move text undert the IOCTL heading (Chris).
- typos
