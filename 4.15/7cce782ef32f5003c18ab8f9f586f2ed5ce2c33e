bpf: fix link error without CONFIG_NET

I ran into this link error with the latest net-next plus linux-next
trees when networking is disabled:

kernel/bpf/verifier.o:(.rodata+0x2958): undefined reference to `tc_cls_act_analyzer_ops'
kernel/bpf/verifier.o:(.rodata+0x2970): undefined reference to `xdp_analyzer_ops'

It seems that the code was written to deal with varying contents of
the arrray, but the actual #ifdef was missing. Both tc_cls_act_analyzer_ops
and xdp_analyzer_ops are defined in the core networking code, so adding
a check for CONFIG_NET seems appropriate here, and I've verified this with
many randconfig builds
