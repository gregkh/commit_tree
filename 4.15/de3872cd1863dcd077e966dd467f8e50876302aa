mlxsw: spectrum: mr: Fix various endianness issues

Fix various endianness issues in comparisons and assignments. The fix is
entirely cosmetic as all the values fixed are endianness-agnostic.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
spectrum_mr.c:156:49: warning: restricted __be32 degrades to integer
spectrum_mr.c:206:26: warning: restricted __be32 degrades to integer
spectrum_mr.c:212:31: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different
  base types)
