ARM: BUG if jumping to usermode address in kernel mode

Detect if we are returning to usermode via the normal kernel exit paths
but the saved PSR value indicates that we are in kernel mode.  This
could occur due to corrupted stack state, which has been observed with
"ftracetest".

This ensures that we catch the problem case before we get to user code.
