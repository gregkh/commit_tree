tcp: allow drivers to tweak TSQ logic

I had many reports that TSQ logic breaks wifi aggregation.

Current logic is to allow up to 1 ms of bytes to be queued into qdisc
and drivers queues.

But Wifi aggregation needs a bigger budget to allow bigger rates to
be discovered by various TCP Congestion Controls algorithms.

This patch adds an extra socket field, allowing wifi drivers to select
another log scale to derive TCP Small Queue credit from current pacing
rate.

Initial value is 10, meaning that this patch does not change current
behavior.

We expect wifi drivers to set this field to smaller values (tests have
been done with values from 6 to 9)

They would have to use following template :

if (skb->sk && skb->sk->sk_pacing_shift != MY_PACING_SHIFT)
     skb->sk->sk_pacing_shift = MY_PACING_SHIFT;
