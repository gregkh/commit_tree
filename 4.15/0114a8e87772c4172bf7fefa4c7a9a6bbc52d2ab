x86/apic: Construct a selector for the interrupt delivery mode

There are quite some switches which are used to determine the final
interrupt delivery mode, as shown below:

1) Kconfig: CONFIG_X86_64; CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC; CONFIG_x86_IO_APIC
2) Command line options: disable_apic; skip_ioapic_setup
3) CPU Capability: boot_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_APIC)
4) MP table: smp_found_config
5) ACPI: acpi_lapic; acpi_ioapic; nr_ioapic

These switches are disordered and scattered and there are also some
dependencies between them. These make the code difficult to maintain and
read.

Construct a selector to unify them into a single function, then, Use this
selector to get an interrupt delivery mode directly.
