eeprom: at24: fix I2C device selection for runtime PM

The at24 driver creates dummy I2C devices to access offsets in the chip
that are outside the area supported using a single I2C address. It is not
meaningful to use runtime PM to such devices; the system firmware (ACPI)
does not know about these devices nor runtime PM was enabled for them.
Always use the real device instead of the dummy ones.
