drm/i915/dp: centralize max source rate conditions more

Turn intel_dp_source_supports_hbr2() into a simple helper to query the
pre-filled source rates array, and move the conditions about which
platforms support which rates to the single point of truth in
intel_dp_set_source_rates().

This also reduces the code paths you have to think about in the source
rates initialization in intel_dp_set_source_rates(), making it easier to
grasp.
