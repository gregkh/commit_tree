drm/amd/display: add detect caps for edp

1. The caps detect sequence for edp is different from dp.
   Added separate function for edp.
2. Removed max_link_setting and replaced it with verified
   to avoid confusion.
3. Reverted sink count guard for edp powerdown as unnecessary
   with the changes above.
