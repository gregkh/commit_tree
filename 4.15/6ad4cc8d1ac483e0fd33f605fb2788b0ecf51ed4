pinctrl: sunxi: Fix A80 interrupt pin bank

On the A80 the pins on port B can trigger interrupts, and those are
assigned to the second interrupt bank.
Having two pins assigned to the same interrupt bank/pin combination does
not look healthy (instead more like a copy&paste bug from pins PA14-PA16),
so fix the interrupt bank for pins PB14-PB16, which is actually 1.

I don't have any A80 board, so could not test this.
