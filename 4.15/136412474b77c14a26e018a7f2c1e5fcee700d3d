tracing, dma-buf: Remove unused trace event dma_fence_annotate_wait_on

Commit e941759c74 ("fence: dma-buf cross-device synchronization") added
trace event fence_annotate_wait_on, but never used it. It was renamed
to dma_fence_annotate_wait_on by commit f54d186700 ("dma-buf: Rename
struct fence to dma_fence") but still not used. As defined trace events
have data structures and functions created for them, it is a waste of
memory if they are not used. Remove the unused trace event.
