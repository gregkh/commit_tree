platform/x86: sony-laptop: Fix error handling in sony_nc_setup_rfkill()

Source code review for a specific software refactoring showed the need
for another correction because the error code "-1" was returned so far
if a call of the function "sony_call_snc_handle" failed here.
Thus assign the return value from these two function calls also to
the variable "err" and provide it in case of a failure.
