time: Move time_t conversion helpers to time32.h

On 64-bit architectures, the timespec64 based helpers in linux/time.h
are defined as macros pointing to their timespec based counterparts.
This made sense when they were first introduced, but as we are migrating
away from timespec in general, it's much less intuitive now.

This changes the macros to work in the exact opposite way: we always
provide the timespec64 based helpers and define the old interfaces as
macros for them. Now we can move those macros into linux/time32.h, which
already contains the respective helpers for 32-bit architectures.
