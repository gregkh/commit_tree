iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Cope with duplicated Stream IDs

For PCI devices behind an aliasing PCIe-to-PCI/X bridge, the bridge
alias to DevFn 0.0 on the subordinate bus may match the original RID of
the device, resulting in the same SID being present in the device's
fwspec twice. This causes trouble later in arm_smmu_write_strtab_ent()
when we wind up visiting the STE a second time and find it already live.

Avoid the issue by giving arm_smmu_install_ste_for_dev() the cleverness
to skip over duplicates. It seems mildly counterintuitive compared to
preventing the duplicates from existing in the first place, but since
the DT and ACPI probe paths build their fwspecs differently, this is
actually the cleanest and most self-contained way to deal with it.
