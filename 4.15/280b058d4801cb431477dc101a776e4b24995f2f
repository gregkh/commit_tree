samples/bpf: xdp_monitor also record xdp_exception tracepoint

Also monitor the tracepoint xdp_exception.  This tracepoint is usually
invoked by the drivers.  Programs themselves can activate this by
returning XDP_ABORTED, which will drop the packet but also trigger the
tracepoint.  This is useful for distinguishing intentional (XDP_DROP)
vs. ebpf-program error cases that cased a drop (XDP_ABORTED).

Drivers also use this tracepoint for reporting on XDP actions that are
unknown to the specific driver.  This can help the user to detect if a
driver e.g. doesn't implement XDP_REDIRECT yet.
