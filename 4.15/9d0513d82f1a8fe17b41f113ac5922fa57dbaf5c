x86/platform/intel-mid: Revert "Make 'bt_sfi_data' const"

So one of the constification patches unearthed a type casting fragility
of the underlying code:

  276c87054751 ("x86/platform/intel-mid: Make 'bt_sfi_data' const")

converted the struct to be const while it is also used as a temporary
container for important data that is used to fill 'parent' and 'name'
fields in struct platform_device_info.

The compiler doesn't notice this due to an explicit type cast that loses
the const - which fragility will be fixed separately.

This type cast turned a seemingly trivial const propagation patch into a
hard to debug data corruptor and crasher bug.
