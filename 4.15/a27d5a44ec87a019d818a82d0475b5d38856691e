drm/i915: Add in-flight request details to intel_engine_dump()

In the intel_engine_cs dumper, we were showing the request details for
the request queue but not of those requests already passed to the hw
(just a summary of the seqno). If we show those details, we can then
eliminate the entirely redundant and forgotten debugfs/i915_gem_request
