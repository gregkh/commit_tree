clocksource/drivers/sh_cmt: Remove unused "renesas, channels-mask" handling

The in-driver channel configuration in sh_cmt_info.channels_mask is now
always set for all CMT devices instantiated from DT.

Hence the "renesas,channels-mask" property is no longer checked, and its
handling can be removed, cfr. commit 4e18111ff38f0664 ("devicetree:
bindings: Remove deprecated properties").
