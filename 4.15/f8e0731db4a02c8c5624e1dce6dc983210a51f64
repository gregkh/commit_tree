dma-fence: fix dma_fence_get_rcu_safe v2

When dma_fence_get_rcu() fails to acquire a reference it doesn't necessary
mean that there is no fence at all.

It usually mean that the fence was replaced by a new one and in this situation
we certainly want to have the new one as result and *NOT* NULL.

v2: Keep extra check after dma_fence_get_rcu().
