btrfs: Fix flush bio leak

Commit e0ae99941423 ("btrfs: preallocate device flush bio") reworked
the way the flush bio is allocated and used. Concretely it allocates
the bio in __alloc_device and then re-uses it multiple times with a
very simple endio routine that just calls complete() without consuming
a reference. Allocated bios by default come with a ref count of 1,
which is then consumed by the endio routine (or not, in which case they
should be bio_put by the caller). The way the impleementation works now
is that the flush bio has a refcount of 2 and we only ever bio_put it
once, leaving it to hang indefinitely. Fix this by removing the extra
bio_get in __alloc_device.
