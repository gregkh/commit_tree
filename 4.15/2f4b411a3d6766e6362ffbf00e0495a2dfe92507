i40e: Enable cloud filters via tc-flower

This patch enables tc-flower based hardware offloads. tc flower
filter provided by the kernel is configured as driver specific
cloud filter. The patch implements functions and admin queue
commands needed to support cloud filters in the driver and
adds cloud filters to configure these tc-flower filters.

The classification function of the filter is to direct matched
packets to a traffic class. The hardware traffic class is set
based on the the classid reserved in the range :ffe0 - :ffef.

Match Dst MAC and route to TC0:
  prio 1 flower dst_mac 3c:fd:fe:a0:d6:70 skip_sw\
  hw_tc 1

Match Dst IPv4,Dst Port and route to TC1:
  prio 2 flower dst_ip 192.168.3.5/32\
  ip_proto udp dst_port 25 skip_sw\
  hw_tc 2

Match Dst IPv6,Dst Port and route to TC1:
  prio 3 flower dst_ip fe8::200:1\
  ip_proto udp dst_port 66 skip_sw\
  hw_tc 2

Delete tc flower filter:
Example:

Flow Director Sideband is disabled while configuring cloud filters
via tc-flower and until any cloud filter exists.

Unsupported matches when cloud filters are added using enhanced
big buffer cloud filter mode of underlying switch include:
1. source port and source IP
2. Combined MAC address and IP fields.
3. Not specifying L4 port

These filter matches can however be used to redirect traffic to
the main VSI (tc 0) which does not require the enhanced big buffer
cloud filter support.
