btrfs: Remove unused arguments from btrfs_changed_cb_t

btrfs_changed_cb_t represents the signature of the callback being passed
to btrfs_compare_trees. Currently there is only one such callback,
namely changed_cb in send.c. This function doesn't really uses the first
2 parameters, i.e. the roots. Since there are not other functions
implementing the btrfs_changed_cb_t let's remove the unused parameters
from the prototype and implementation.
