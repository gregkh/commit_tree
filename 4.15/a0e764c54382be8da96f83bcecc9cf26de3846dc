md: raid10: remove a couple of redundant variables and initializations

Variables dev and bio_last_sector are assigned values that are never
read and hence these are redundant variables and can be removed.
Also remove the duplicated initialization of sectors, the latter
assignment is identical to the first and can be removed.

Cleans up 3 clang build warnings:
Value stored to 'dev' is never read
Value stored to 'bio_last_sector' is never read
Value stored to 'sectors' during its initialization is never read
