drm/i915: align the vma start to the largest gtt page size

For the 48b PPGTT try to align the vma start address to the required
page size boundary to guarantee we use said page size in the gtt. If we
are dealing with multiple page sizes, we can't guarantee anything and
just align to the largest. For soft pinning and objects which need to be
tightly packed into the lower 32bits we don't force any alignment.

v2: various improvements suggested by Chris

v3: use set_pages and better placement of page_sizes

v4: prefer upper_32_bits()

v5: assign vma->page_sizes = vma->obj->page_sizes directly
    prefer sizeof(vma->page_sizes)

v6: fixup checking of end to exclude GGTT (which are assumed to be
    limited to 4G).
