Revert "net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Defer port enabling to calling port_enable"

This reverts commit e85ec74ace29 ("net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Defer port
enabling to calling port_enable") because this now makes an unbind
followed by a bind to fail connecting to the ingrated PHY.

What this patch missed is that we need the PHY to be enabled with
bcm_sf2_gphy_enable_set() before probing it on the MDIO bus. This is
correctly done in the ops->setup() function, but by the time
ops->port_enable() runs, this is too late. Upon unbind we would power
down the PHY, and so when we would bind again, the PHY would be left
powered off.
