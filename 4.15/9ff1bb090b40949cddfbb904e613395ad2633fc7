drm/amd/display: Add extra mode and clock info to DTN logs

Adds some additional information to logs in dc_commit_streams to
better match Dal2.

Also adds a new function, dc_raw_log, that has the same
functionality as dc_conn_log, but does not attach display specific
prefixes to the log output.

Finally, adds a new DC log type, LOG_DTN, that logs to
LogMinor_DispConnect_dtn in DM. This new log type and dc_raw_log
are used to generate clock info in the logs to match Dal2.
