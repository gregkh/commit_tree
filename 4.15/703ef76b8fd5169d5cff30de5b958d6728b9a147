ARM: shmobile: rcar-gen2: fix non-SMP build

A bugfix for the SMP case broke the build for the UP case:

arch/arm/mach-shmobile/headsmp-apmu.o: In function `shmobile_boot_apmu':
(.text+0x34): undefined reference to `secondary_startup'

The assembler file mixes code that is used for SMP with code
that we also need on a single-CPU build, so I'm leaving it
always enabled in the Makefile, but enclose the SMP code
in an #ifdef.
