crypto: marvell - Switch cipher algs to the skcipher interface

crypto_alg is not supposed to be directly implemented by crypto engine
driver. Drivers should instead implement specialized interfaces like
ahash_alg or skcipher_alg.

Migrate to all cipher algorithms to the skcipher_alg interface. While at
it, get rid of all references to ablkcipher including in internal struct
or function names.
