netlink: reset extack earlier in netlink_rcv_skb

Move up the extack reset/initialization in netlink_rcv_skb, so that
those 'goto ack' will not skip it. Otherwise, later on netlink_ack
may use the uninitialized extack and cause kernel crash.

Fixes: cbbdf8433a5f ("netlink: extack needs to be reset each time through loop")
