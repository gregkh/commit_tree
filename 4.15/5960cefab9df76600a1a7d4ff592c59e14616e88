sctp: add a ceiling to optlen in some sockopts

Hangbin Liu reported that some sockopt calls could cause the kernel to log
a warning on memory allocation failure if the user supplied a large optlen
value. That is because some of them called memdup_user() without a ceiling
on optlen, allowing it to try to allocate really large buffers.

This patch adds a ceiling by limiting optlen to the maximum allowed that
would still make sense for these sockopt.
