drm/radeon: remove init of CIK VMIDs 8-16 for amdkfd

VMIDs 8-16 in Kaveri were reserved for use by the amdkfd driver.
Because we removed amdkfd support from radeon, those VMIDs are now
used by radeon and are initialized by radeon.

This patch removes the function that initialized those VMIDs for amdkfd
use.
This initialization overridden the radeon initialization and caused GPU
faults and GUI crashed.
