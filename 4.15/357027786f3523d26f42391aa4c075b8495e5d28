PCI: Avoid bus reset if bridge itself is broken

When checking to see if a PCI bus can safely be reset, we previously
checked to see if any of the children had their PCI_DEV_FLAGS_NO_BUS_RESET
flag set.  Children marked with that flag are known not to behave well
after a bus reset.

Some PCIe root port bridges also do not behave well after a bus reset,
sometimes causing the devices behind the bridge to become unusable.

Add a check for PCI_DEV_FLAGS_NO_BUS_RESET being set in the bridge device
to allow these bridges to be flagged, and prevent their secondary buses
from being reset.
