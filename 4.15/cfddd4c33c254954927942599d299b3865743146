ip_gre: remove the incorrect mtu limit for ipgre tap

ipgre tap driver calls ether_setup(), after commit 61e84623ace3
("net: centralize net_device min/max MTU checking"), the range
of mtu is [min_mtu, max_mtu], which is [68, 1500] by default.

It causes the dev mtu of the ipgre tap device to not be greater
than 1500, this limit value is not correct for ipgre tap device.

Besides, it's .change_mtu already does the right check. So this
patch is just to set max_mtu as 0, and leave the check to it's
.change_mtu.
