f2fs: optimize the way of traversing free_nid_bitmap

We call scan_free_nid_bits only when there isn't many
free nids left, it means that marked bits in free_nid_bitmap
are supposed to be few, use find_next_bit_le is more
efficient in such case.
According to my tests, use find_next_bit_le instead of
test_bit_le will cut down the traversal time to one
third of its original.
