powerpc/64s/hash: Fix 512T hint detection to use >= 128T

Currently userspace is able to request mmap() search between 128T-512T
by specifying a hint address that is greater than 128T. But that means
a hint of 128T exactly will return an address below 128T, which is
confusing and wrong.

So fix the logic to check the hint is greater than *or equal* to 128T.
