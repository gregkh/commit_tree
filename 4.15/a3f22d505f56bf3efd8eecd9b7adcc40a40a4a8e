s390/perf: add callback to perf to enable using AUX buffer

Perf tool need implement a callback to enable using AUX buffer. Perf
will do another mmap() to trigger the setup of AUX buffer in kernel
if there is such callback. The default size of the AUX buffer is set
properly according to the sampling frequency to avoid overflow. It
could also be manually set by -m option of perf.

The interface of perf is not changed. Diagnostic mode sampling
could be started by `perf record -e rBD000` like before.
