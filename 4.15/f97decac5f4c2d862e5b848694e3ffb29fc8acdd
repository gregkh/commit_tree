drm/msm: Support multiple ringbuffers

Add the infrastructure to support the idea of multiple ringbuffers.
Assign each ringbuffer an id and use that as an index for the various
ring specific operations.

The biggest delta is to support legacy fences. Each fence gets its own
sequence number but the legacy functions expect to use a unique integer.
To handle this we return a unique identifier for each submission but
map it to a specific ring/sequence under the covers. Newer users use
a dma_fence pointer anyway so they don't care about the actual sequence
ID or ring.

The actual mechanics for multiple ringbuffers are very target specific
so this code just allows for the possibility but still only defines
one ringbuffer for each target family.
