ALSA: hda: Avoid racy recreation of widget kobjects

The refresh of HD-audio widget sysfs kobjects via
snd_hdac_refresh_widget_sysfs() is slightly racy.
The driver recreates the whole tree from scratch after deleting the
whole.  When CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE option is used, kobject
release doesn't happen immediately but delayed, while the re-creation
of the same named kobject happens soon after invoking kobject_put().
This may end up with the conflicts of duplicated kobjects, as found in
the bug report below.

In this patch, we take another approach to refresh the tree: instead
of recreating the whole tree, just add the new nodes and delete the
non-existing nodes.  Since the refresh happens only once at
initialization, no longer race would happen.

Along with the code change, merge snd_hdac_refresh_widget_sysfs() with
the existing snd_hdac_refresh_widgets() with an additional bool flag
for simplifying the code.
