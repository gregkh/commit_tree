mlxsw: spectrum_switchdev: Save mids list per bridge device

Instead of saving all the mids in the same list, save them per vlan
device. This change allows a more efficient mid find.
Also, in the next patches, there will be added a lot of loops over all the
mids in bridge device for multicast disable, mrouter change and ndb flush.
