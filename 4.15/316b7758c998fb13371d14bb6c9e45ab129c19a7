ASoC: sun8i-codec: Set the BCLK divider

While the current code was reporting to be able to work in master mode, it
failed to do so because the BCLK divider wasn't programmed, meaning that
the BCLK would run at the PLL's frequency no matter the sample rate.

It was obviously a bit too fast.

Add support to retrieve the divider to use, and set it. Since our PLL is
not always able to generate a perfect multiple of the sample rate, we'll
have to choose the closest divider that matches our setup.
