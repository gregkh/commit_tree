ipv6: start fib6 gc on RTF_CACHE dst creation

After the commit 2b760fcf5cfb ("ipv6: hook up exception table
to store dst cache"), the fib6 gc is not started after the
creation of a RTF_CACHE via a redirect or pmtu update, since
fib6_add() isn't invoked anymore for such dsts.

We need the fib6 gc to run periodically to clean the RTF_CACHE,
or the dst will stay there forever.

Fix it by explicitly calling fib6_force_start_gc() on successful
exception creation. gc_args->more accounting will ensure that
the gc timer will run for whatever time needed to properly
clean the table.

v2 -> v3:
 - clarified the commit message
