udf: Fix signed/unsigned format specifiers

Fix problems noted in compilion with -Wformat=2 -Wformat-signedness.
In particular, a mismatch between the signedness of a value and the
signedness of its format specifier can result in unsigned values being
printed as negative numbers, e.g.:

  Partition (0 type 1511) starts at physical 460, block length -1779968542

...which occurs when mounting a large (> 1 TiB) UDF partition.

Changes since V1:
* Fixed additional issues noted in udf_bitmap_free_blocks(),
  udf_get_fileident(), udf_show_options()
