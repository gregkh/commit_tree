arm64/sve: Low-level CPU setup

To enable the kernel to use SVE, SVE traps from EL1 to EL2 must be
disabled.  To take maximum advantage of the hardware, the full
available vector length also needs to be enabled for EL1 by
programming ZCR_EL2.LEN.  (The kernel will program ZCR_EL1.LEN as
required, but this cannot override the limit set by ZCR_EL2.)

This patch makes the appropriate changes to the EL2 early setup
code.
