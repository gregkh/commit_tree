fib: notifier: Add VIF add and delete event types

In order for an interface to forward packets according to the kernel
multicast routing table, it must be configured with a VIF index according
to the mroute user API. The VIF index is then used to refer to that
interface in the mroute user API, for example, to set the iif and oifs of
an MFC entry.

In order to allow drivers to be aware and offload multicast routes, they
have to be aware of the VIF add and delete notifications.

Due to the fact that a specific VIF can be deleted and re-added pointing to
another netdevice, and the MFC routes that point to it will forward the
matching packets to the new netdevice, a driver willing to offload MFC
cache entries must be aware of the VIF add and delete events in addition to
MFC routes notifications.
