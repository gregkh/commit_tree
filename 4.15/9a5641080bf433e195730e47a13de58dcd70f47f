s390/zcrypt: Introduce QACT support for AP bus devices.

This patch introduces a new ap_qact() function which
exploits the PQAP(QACT) subfunction. QACT is a new
interface to Query the Ap Compatilibity Type based
on a given AP qid, type, mode and version.

Based on this new function the AP bus scan code is
slightly reworked to use this new interface for
querying the compatible type for each new AP queue
device detected. So new and unknown devices can
get automatically mapped to a compatible type and
handled without the need for toleration patches
for every new hardware.

The currently highest known hardware is CEX6S.
With this patch a possible successor can get
queried for a combatible type known by the device
driver without the need for an toleration patch.
