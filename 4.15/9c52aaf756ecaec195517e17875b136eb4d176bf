dt-bindings: Amlogic: Add Meson8 and Meson8b SMP related documentation

With this patch we add documentation for:

* power-management-unit: the PMU is used to bring up the cores during
  SMP operations
* sram: among other things the sram is used to store the first code
  executed by the core when it is powered up
* cpu-enable-method: the CPU enable method used by Amlogic Meson8 and
  Meson8b SoCs
