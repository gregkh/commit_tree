bpf: move knowledge about post-translation offsets out of verifier

Use the fact that verifier ops are now separate from program
ops to define a separate set of callbacks for verification of
already translated programs.

Since we expect the analyzer ops to be defined only for
a small subset of all program types initialize their array
by hand (don't use linux/bpf_types.h).
