drm/amd/powerplay: fix copy-n-paste error on vddci_buf index

The index to vddci_buf is using profile->ucElbVDDC_Num rather
than profile->ucElbVDDCI_Num; this looks like a copy-n-paste
error from previous code for the vddc_buf array and I'm pretty
sure this is incorrect. Fix this by using the correct variable.
