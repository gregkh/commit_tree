audit: ensure that 'audit=1' actually enables audit for PID 1

Prior to this patch we enabled audit in audit_init(), which is too
late for PID 1 as the standard initcalls are run after the PID 1 task
is forked.  This means that we never allocate an audit_context (see
audit_alloc()) for PID 1 and therefore miss a lot of audit events
generated by PID 1.

This patch enables audit as early as possible to help ensure that when
PID 1 is forked it can allocate an audit_context if required.
