ASoC: rt5514: Make sure the DMIC delay will be happened after normal SUPPLY widgets power on

The patch makes sure the DMIC delay will be happened after normal SUPPLY
widgets power on. If there are some platforms that provide the MCLK using
the SUPPLY widget, it will make sure the delay time is helpful.
