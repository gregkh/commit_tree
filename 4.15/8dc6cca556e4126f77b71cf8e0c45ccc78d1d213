KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't rely on host's page size information

This removes the dependence of KVM on the mmu_psize_defs array (which
stores information about hardware support for various page sizes) and
the things derived from it, chiefly hpte_page_sizes[], hpte_page_size(),
hpte_actual_page_size() and get_sllp_encoding().  We also no longer
rely on the mmu_slb_size variable or the MMU_FTR_1T_SEGMENTS feature
bit.

The reason for doing this is so we can support a HPT guest on a radix
host.  In a radix host, the mmu_psize_defs array contains information
about page sizes supported by the MMU in radix mode rather than the
page sizes supported by the MMU in HPT mode.  Similarly, mmu_slb_size
and the MMU_FTR_1T_SEGMENTS bit are not set.

Instead we hard-code knowledge of the behaviour of the HPT MMU in the
POWER7, POWER8 and POWER9 processors (which are the only processors
supported by HV KVM) - specifically the encoding of the LP fields in
the HPT and SLB entries, and the fact that they have 32 SLB entries
and support 1TB segments.
