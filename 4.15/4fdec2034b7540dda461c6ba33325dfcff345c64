x86/cpufeature: Move processor tracing out of scattered features

Processor tracing is already enumerated in word 9 (CPUID[7,0].EBX),
so do not duplicate it in the scattered features word.

Besides being more tidy, this will be useful for KVM when it presents
processor tracing to the guests.  KVM selects host features that are
supported by both the host kernel (depending on command line options,
CPU errata, or whatever) and KVM.  Whenever a full feature word exists,
KVM's code is written in the expectation that the CPUID bit number
matches the X86_FEATURE_* bit number, but this is not the case for
X86_FEATURE_INTEL_PT.
