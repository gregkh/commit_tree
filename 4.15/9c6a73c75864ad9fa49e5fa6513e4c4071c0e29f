x86/cpu/AMD: Use LFENCE_RDTSC in preference to MFENCE_RDTSC

With LFENCE now a serializing instruction, use LFENCE_RDTSC in preference
to MFENCE_RDTSC.  However, since the kernel could be running under a
hypervisor that does not support writing that MSR, read the MSR back and
verify that the bit has been set successfully.  If the MSR can be read
and the bit is set, then set the LFENCE_RDTSC feature, otherwise set the
MFENCE_RDTSC feature.
