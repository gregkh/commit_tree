mtd: spi-nor: add spi_nor_init() function

This patch extracts some chunks from spi_nor_init_params and spi_nor_scan()
 and moves them into a new spi_nor_init() function.

Indeed, spi_nor_init() regroups all the required SPI flash commands to be
sent to the SPI flash memory before performing any runtime operations
(Fast Read, Page Program, Sector Erase, ...). Hence spi_nor_init():
1) removes the flash protection if applicable for certain vendors.
2) sets the Quad Enable bit, if needed, before using Quad SPI protocols.
3) makes the memory enter its (stateful) 4-byte address mode, if needed,
   for SPI flash memory > 128Mbits not supporting the 4-byte address
   instruction set.

spi_nor_scan() now ends by calling spi_nor_init() once the probe phase has
completed. Further patches could also use spi_nor_init() to implement the
mtd->_resume() handler for the spi-nor framework.
