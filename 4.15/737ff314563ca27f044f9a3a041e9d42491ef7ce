tcp: use sequence distance to detect reordering

Replace the reordering distance measurement in packet unit with
sequence based approach. Previously it trackes the number of "packets"
toward the forward ACK (i.e.  highest sacked sequence)in a state
variable "fackets_out".

Precisely measuring reordering degree on packet distance has not much
benefit, as the degree constantly changes by factors like path, load,
and congestion window. It is also complicated and prone to arcane bugs.
This patch replaces with sequence-based approach that's much simpler.
