tools: bpftool: add JSON output for `bpftool prog show *` command

Reuse the json_writer API introduced in an earlier commit to make
bpftool able to generate JSON output on `bpftool prog show *` commands.

For readability, the code from show_prog() has been split into two
functions, one for plain output, one for JSON.

Outputs from sample programs have been successfully tested against a
JSON validator.
