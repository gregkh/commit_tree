Btrfs: do not async submit for nodatasum inodes

While we submit direct writes, if the inode is flagged with nodatasum,
there's no benefit to submit asynchronously, because

a) we don't have to calculate checksum across processors,

b) and direct IO has started a plug, but async submit makes us queue
IO on each device's scheduled IO list instead of DIO's plug list, so
that IOs get much less merges in general.

Lets use sync submit for nodatasum inodes.
