crypto: n2 - cure use after free

queue_cache_init is first called for the Control Word Queue
(n2_crypto_probe). At that time, queue_cache[0] is NULL and a new
kmem_cache will be allocated. If the subsequent n2_register_algs call
fails, the kmem_cache will be released in queue_cache_destroy, but
queue_cache_init[0] is not set back to NULL.

So when the Module Arithmetic Unit gets probed next (n2_mau_probe),
queue_cache_init will not allocate a kmem_cache again, but leave it
as its bogus value, causing a BUG() to trigger when queue_cache[0] is
eventually passed to kmem_cache_zalloc:
