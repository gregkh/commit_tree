net: hns3: fix the bug of hns3_set_txbd_baseinfo

The SC bits of TX BD mean switch control. For this area, value 0
indicates no switch control, the packet is routed according to the
forwarding table. Value 1 indicates that the packet is transmitted
to the network bypassing the forwarding table.

As HNS3 driver need support VF later, VF conmunicate with its own
PF need forwarding table. This patch sets SC bits of TX BD 0 and use
forwarding table.
