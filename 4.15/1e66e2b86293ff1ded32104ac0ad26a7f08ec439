x86/apic: Use dead_cpu instead of current CPU when cleaning up

x2apic_dead_cpu() cleans up the leftovers of a CPU which got unplugged, but
instead of clearing the dead cpu bit in the cluster mask it clears the
current (alive) cpu bit. Noticed because smp_processor_id() is called in
preemptible code and triggers a debug warning.
