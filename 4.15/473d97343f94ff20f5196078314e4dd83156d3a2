bpf: Change bpf_obj_name_cpy() to better ensure map's name is init by 0

During get_info_by_fd, the prog/map name is memcpy-ed.  It depends
on the prog->aux->name and map->name to be zero initialized.

bpf_prog_aux is easy to guarantee that aux->name is zero init.

The name in bpf_map may be harder to be guaranteed in the future when
new map type is added.

Hence, this patch makes bpf_obj_name_cpy() to always zero init
the prog/map name.
