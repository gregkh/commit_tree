staging: fsl-dpaa2/eth: Fix potential endless loop

We incorrectly assumed that dpaa2_io_release() can only
return -EBUSY as an error code, when in fact it can also
fail in case some of its arguments don't have valid values.

Make sure we only retry the operation while the portal is
busy and abort for all other error cases, otherwise we risk
entering an endless loop.
