drm: Release driver tracking before making the object available again

This is the same bug as we fixed in commit f6cd7daecff5 ("drm: Release
driver references to handle before making it available again"), but now
the exposure is via the PRIME lookup tables. If we remove the
object/handle from the PRIME lut, then a new request for the same
object/fd will generate a new handle, thus for a short window that
object is known to userspace by two different handles. Fix this by
releasing the driver tracking before PRIME.

Fixes: 0ff926c7d4f0 ("drm/prime: add exported buffers to current fprivs
imported buffer list (v2)")
