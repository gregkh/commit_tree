tools: slabinfo: add "-U" option to show unreclaimable slabs only

Patch series "oom: capture unreclaimable slab info in oom message", v10.

Recently we ran into a oom issue, kernel panic due to no killable
process.  The dmesg shows huge unreclaimable slabs used almost 100%
memory, but kdump doesn't capture vmcore due to some reason.

So, it may sound better to capture unreclaimable slab info in oom
message when kernel panic to aid trouble shooting and cover the corner
case.  Since kernel already panic, so capturing more information sounds
worthy and doesn't bother normal oom killer.

With the patchset, tools/vm/slabinfo has a new option, "-U", to show
unreclaimable slab only.

And, oom will print all non zero (num_objs * size != 0) unreclaimable
slabs in oom killer message.

This patch (of 3):

Add "-U" option to show unreclaimable slabs only.

"-U" and "-S" together can tell us what unreclaimable slabs use the most
memory to help debug huge unreclaimable slabs issue.
