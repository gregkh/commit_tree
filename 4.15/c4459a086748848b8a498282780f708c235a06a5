PCI: pciehp: Convert timers to use timer_setup()

In preparation for unconditionally passing the struct timer_list pointer to
all timer callbacks, switch to using the new timer_setup() and from_timer()
to pass the timer pointer explicitly. This fixes what appears to be a bug
in passing the wrong pointer to the timer handler (address of ctrl pointer
instead of ctrl pointer).
