PM / s2idle: Clear the events_check_enabled flag

Problem: This flag does not get cleared currently in the suspend or
resume path in the following cases:

 * In case some driver's suspend routine returns an error.
 * Successful s2idle case
 * etc?

Why is this a problem: What happens is that the next suspend attempt
could fail even though the user did not enable the flag by writing to
/sys/power/wakeup_count. This is 1 use case how the issue can be seen
(but similar use case with driver suspend failure can be thought of):

 1. Read /sys/power/wakeup_count
 2. echo count > /sys/power/wakeup_count
 3. echo freeze > /sys/power/wakeup_count
 4. Let the system suspend, and wakeup the system using some wake source
    that calls pm_wakeup_event() e.g. power button or something.
 5. Note that the combined wakeup count would be incremented due
    to the pm_wakeup_event() in the resume path.
 6. After resuming the events_check_enabled flag is still set.

At this point if the user attempts to freeze again (without writing to
/sys/power/wakeup_count), the suspend would fail even though there has
been no wake event since the past resume.

Address that by clearing the flag just before a resume is completed,
so that it is always cleared for the corner cases mentioned above.
