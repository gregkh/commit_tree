drm/amdgpu: map compute rings by least recently used pipe

This patch provides a guarantee that the first n queues allocated by
an application will be on different pipes. Where n is the number of
pipes available from the hardware.

This helps avoid ring aliasing which can result in work executing in
time-sliced mode instead of truly parallel mode.
