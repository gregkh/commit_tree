afs: Make use of the YFS service upgrade to fully support IPv6

YFS VL servers offer an upgraded Volume Location service that can return
IPv6 addresses to fileservers and volume servers in addition to IPv4
addresses using the YFSVL.GetEndpoints operation which we should use if
it's available.

To this end:

 (1) Make rxrpc_kernel_recv_data() return the call's current service ID so
     that the caller can detect service upgrade and see what the service
     was upgraded to.

 (2) When we see a VL server address we haven't seen before, send a
     VL.GetCapabilities operation to it with the service upgrade bit set.

     If we get an upgrade to the YFS VL service, change the service ID in
     the address list for that address to use the upgraded service and set
     a flag to note that this appears to be a YFS-compatible server.

 (3) If, when a server's addresses are being looked up, we note that we
     previously detected a YFS-compatible server, then send the
     YFSVL.GetEndpoints operation rather than VL.GetAddrsU.

 (4) Build a fileserver address list from the reply of YFSVL.GetEndpoints,
     including both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  Volume server addresses are
     discarded.

 (5) The address list is sorted by address and port now, instead of just
     address.  This allows multiple servers on the same host sitting on
     different ports.
