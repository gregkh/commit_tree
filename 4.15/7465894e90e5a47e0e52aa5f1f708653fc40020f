KVM: arm/arm64: Fix spinlock acquisition in vgic_set_owner

vgic_set_owner acquires the irq lock without disabling interrupts,
resulting in a lockdep splat (an interrupt could fire and result
in the same lock being taken if the same virtual irq is to be
injected).

In practice, it is almost impossible to trigger this bug, but
better safe than sorry. Convert the lock acquisition to a
spin_lock_irqsave() and keep lockdep happy.
