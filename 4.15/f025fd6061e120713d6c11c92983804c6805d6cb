net/mlx4_en: XDP_TX, assign constant values of TX descs on ring creaion

In XDP_TX, some fields in tx_info and tx_desc are constants across
all entries of the different XDP_TX rings.
Assign values to these fields on ring creation time, rather than in
data-path.

Patchset performance tests:
Tested on ConnectX3Pro, Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v3 @ 2.50GHz
Single queue no-RSS optimization ON.

XDP_TX packet rate:
------------------------------
Before    | After     | Gain |
13.7 Mpps | 14.0 Mpps | %2.2 |
