xfs: remove support for inlining data/extents into the inode fork

Supporting a small bit of data inside the inode fork blows up the fork size
a lot, removing the 32 bytes of inline data halves the effective size of
the inode fork (and it still has a lot of unused padding left), and the
performance of a single kmalloc doesn't show up compared to the size to read
an inode or create one.

It also simplifies the fork management code a lot.
