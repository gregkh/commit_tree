netem: add uapi to express delay and jitter in nanoseconds

netem userspace has long relied on a horrible /proc/net/psched hack
to translate the current notion of "ticks" to nanoseconds.

Expressing latency and jitter instead, in well defined nanoseconds,
increases the dynamic range of emulated delays and jitter in netem.

It will also ease a transition where reducing a tick to nsec
equivalence would constrain the max delay in prior versions of
netem to only 4.3 seconds.
