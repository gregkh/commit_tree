powerpc/vas: Define vas_win_paste_addr()

Define an interface that the NX drivers can use to find the physical
paste address of a send window. This interface is expected to be used
with the mmap() operation of the NX driver's device. i.e the user space
process can use driver's mmap() operation to map the send window's paste
address into their address space and then use copy and paste instructions
to submit the CRBs to the NX engine.

Note that kernel drivers will use vas_paste_crb() directly and don't need
this interface.
