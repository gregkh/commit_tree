net/mlx5e: IPoIB, Move underlay QP init/uninit to separate functions

During the creation of the underlay QP the PKEY index is unknown, the
PKEY index is known only when calling ndo_open.
PKEY index attached to the QP during state modification.

Splitting the functions will also make the code symmetric and more
readable. This split is also required for later PKEY support to be
called with the PKEY index during ndo_open.
