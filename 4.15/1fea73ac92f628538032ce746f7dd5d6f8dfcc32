NFS: remove special-case revalidate in nfs_opendir()

Commit f5a73672d181 ("NFS: allow close-to-open cache semantics to
apply to root of NFS filesystem") added a call to
__nfs_revalidate_inode() to nfs_opendir to as the lookup
process wouldn't reliable do this.

Subsequent commit a3fbbde70a0c ("VFS: we need to set LOOKUP_JUMPED
on mountpoint crossing") make this unnecessary.  So remove the
unnecessary code.
