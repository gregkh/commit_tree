RISC-V: Atomic and Locking Code

This contains all the code that directly interfaces with the RISC-V
memory model.  While this code corforms to the current RISC-V ISA
specifications (user 2.2 and priv 1.10), the memory model is somewhat
underspecified in those documents.  There is a working group that hopes
to produce a formal memory model by the end of the year, but my
understanding is that the basic definitions we're relying on here won't
change significantly.
