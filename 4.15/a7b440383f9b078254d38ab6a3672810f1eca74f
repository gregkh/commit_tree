powerpc/kprobes: Do not suppress instruction emulation if a single run failed

Currently, we disable instruction emulation if emulate_step() fails for
any reason. However, such failures could be transient and specific to a
particular run. Instead, only disable instruction emulation if we have
never been able to emulate this. If we had emulated this instruction
successfully at least once, then we single step only this probe hit and
continue to try emulating the instruction in subsequent probe hits.
