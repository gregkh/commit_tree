media: davinci: do a couple of checkpatch cleanups

- Delete an error message for a failed memory allocation
  in init_vpbe_layer();

- Replace the specification of data structures by pointer dereferences
  as the parameter for the operator "sizeof" to make the corresponding
  size determination a bit safer according to the Linux coding style
  convention;

- media: DaVinci-VPBE-Display: Improve a size determination in two
  functions

- Adjust 12 checks for null pointers

Those issues were pointed by checkpatch.pl and Coccinelle.
