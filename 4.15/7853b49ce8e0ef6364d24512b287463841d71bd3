net: ena: unmask MSI-X only after device initialization is completed

Under certain conditions MSI-X interrupt might arrive right after it
was unmasked in ena_up(). There is a chance it would be processed by
the driver before device ENA_FLAG_DEV_UP flag is set. In such a case
the interrupt is ignored.
ENA device operates in auto-masked mode, therefore ignoring
interrupt leaves it masked for good.
Moving unmask of interrupt to be the last step in ena_up().
