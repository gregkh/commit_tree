KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: restructure kvm_vgic_(un)map_phys_irq

We want to reuse the core of the map/unmap functions for IRQ
forwarding. Let's move the computation of the hwirq in
kvm_vgic_map_phys_irq and pass the linux IRQ as parameter.
the host_irq is added to struct vgic_irq.

We introduce kvm_vgic_map/unmap_irq which take a struct vgic_irq
handle as a parameter.
