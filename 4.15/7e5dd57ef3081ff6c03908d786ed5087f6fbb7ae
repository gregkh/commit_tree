nvme-pci: fix NULL pointer dereference in nvme_free_host_mem()

Following condition which will cause NULL pointer dereference will
occur in nvme_free_host_mem() when it tries to remove pci device via
nvme_remove() especially after a failure of host memory allocation for HMB.

    "(host_mem_descs == NULL) && (nr_host_mem_descs != 0)"

It's because __nr_host_mem_descs__ is not cleared to 0 unlike
__host_mem_descs__ is so.
