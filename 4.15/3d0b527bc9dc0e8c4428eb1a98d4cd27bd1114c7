netfilter: conntrack: add and use nf_ct_l4proto_log_invalid

We currently pass down the l4 protocol to the conntrack ->packet()
function, but the only user of this is the debug info decision.

Same information can be derived from struct nf_conn.
Add a wrapper for the previous patch that extracs the information
from nf_conn and passes it to nf_l4proto_log_invalid().
