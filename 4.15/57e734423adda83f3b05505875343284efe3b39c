vsprintf: refactor %pK code out of pointer()

Currently code to handle %pK is all within the switch statement in
pointer(). This is the wrong level of abstraction. Each of the other switch
clauses call a helper function, pK should do the same.

Refactor code out of pointer() to new function restricted_pointer().
