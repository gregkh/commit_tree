drm/panel: simple: Skip error message on deferred probe

When enable_gpio is provided via an I2C or SPI expander, it may not be
available when panel-simple probes leading to the following error:

panel-simple panel: failed to request GPIO: -517

As this error message is not very useful to the end user, skip printing
it in the case of deferred probe.
