NFS: revalidate "." etc correctly on "open".

For correct close-to-open semantics, NFS must validate
the change attribute of a directory (or file) on open.

Since commit ecf3d1f1aa74 ("vfs: kill FS_REVAL_DOT by adding a
d_weak_revalidate dentry op"), open() of "." or a path ending ".." is
not revalidated reliably (except when that direct is a mount point).

Prior to that commit, "." was revalidated using nfs_lookup_revalidate()
which checks the LOOKUP_OPEN flag and forces revalidation if the flag is
set.
Since that commit, nfs_weak_revalidate() is used for NFSv3 (which
ignores the flags) and nothing is used for NFSv4.

This is fixed by using nfs_lookup_verify_inode() in
nfs_weak_revalidate().  This does the revalidation exactly when needed.
Also, add a definition of .d_weak_revalidate for NFSv4.

The incorrect behavior is easily demonstrated by running "echo *" in
some non-mountpoint NFS directory while watching network traffic.
Without this patch, "echo *" sometimes doesn't produce any traffic.
With the patch it always does.
