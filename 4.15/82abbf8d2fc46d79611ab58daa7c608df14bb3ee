bpf: do not allow root to mangle valid pointers

Do not allow root to convert valid pointers into unknown scalars.
In particular disallow:
 ptr &= reg
 ptr <<= reg
 ptr += ptr
and explicitly allow:
 ptr -= ptr
since pkt_end - pkt == length

1.
This minimizes amount of address leaks root can do.
In the future may need to further tighten the leaks with kptr_restrict.

2.
If program has such pointer math it's likely a user mistake and
when verifier complains about it right away instead of many instructions
later on invalid memory access it's easier for users to fix their progs.

3.
when register holding a pointer cannot change to scalar it allows JITs to
optimize better. Like 32-bit archs could use single register for pointers
instead of a pair required to hold 64-bit scalars.

4.
reduces architecture dependent behavior. Since code:
r1 = r10;
r1 &= 0xff;
if (r1 ...)
will behave differently arm64 vs x64 and offloaded vs native.

A significant chunk of ptr mangling was allowed by
commit f1174f77b50c ("bpf/verifier: rework value tracking")
yet some of it was allowed even earlier.
