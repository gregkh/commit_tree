sctp: make use of pre-calculated len

Some sockopt handling functions were calculating the length of the
buffer to be written to userspace and then calculating it again when
actually writing the buffer, which could lead to some write not using
an up-to-date length.

This patch updates such places to just make use of the len variable.

Also, replace some sizeof(type) to sizeof(var).
