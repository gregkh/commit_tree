i2c: aspeed: Deassert reset in probe

In order to use i2c from a cold boot, the i2c peripheral must be taken
out of reset. We request a shared reset controller each time a bus
driver is loaded, as the reset is shared between the 14 i2c buses.

On remove the reset is asserted, which only touches the hardware once
the last i2c bus is removed.

The reset is required as the I2C buses will not work without releasing
the reset. Previously the driver only worked with out of tree hacks
that released this reset before the driver was loaded. Update the
device tree bindings to reflect this.
