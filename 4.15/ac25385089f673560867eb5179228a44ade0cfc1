kernel/signal.c: protect the SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE tasks from !sig_kernel_only() signals

Change sig_task_ignored() to drop the SIG_DFL && !sig_kernel_only()
signals even if force == T.  This simplifies the next change and this
matches the same check in get_signal() which will drop these signals
anyway.
