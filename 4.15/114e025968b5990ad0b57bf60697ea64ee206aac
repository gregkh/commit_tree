dm zoned: ignore last smaller runt zone

The SCSI layer allows ZBC drives to have a smaller last runt zone. For
such a device, specifying the entire capacity for a dm-zoned target
table entry fails because the specified capacity is not aligned on a
device zone size indicated in the request queue structure of the
device.

Fix this problem by ignoring the last runt zone in the entry length
when seting up the dm-zoned target (ctr method) and when iterating table
entries of the target (iterate_devices method). This allows dm-zoned
users to still easily setup a target using the entire device capacity
(as mandated by dm-zoned) or the aligned capacity excluding the last
runt zone.

While at it, replace direct references to the device queue chunk_sectors
limit with calls to the accessor blk_queue_zone_sectors().
