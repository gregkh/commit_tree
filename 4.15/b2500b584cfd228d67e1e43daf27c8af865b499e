ALSA: usb-audio: uac1: Invalidate ctl on interrupt

When an interrupt occurs, the value of at least one of the belonging
controls should have changed. To make sure they get re-read from device
on the next read, invalidate the cache. This was correctly implemented
for uac2 already, but missing for uac1.
