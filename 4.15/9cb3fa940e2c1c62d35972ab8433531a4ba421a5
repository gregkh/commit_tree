mlxsw: acl: Change trap ACL action to get the trap_id as a parameter

Allow the trap ACL action to be configured with different traps. This
allows the multicast router offloading code to use that same ACL action
with the multicast router traps. By using different traps, the multicast
router can have different trap policies and can handle the packet
differently.
