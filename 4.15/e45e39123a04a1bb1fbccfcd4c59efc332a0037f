ASoC: Intel: cht_bsw_rt5672: use actual HID in suspend/resume

The code scans all components looking for the default name
i2c-10EC5670:00, which of course doesn't work in platforms
where the BIOS uses a different HID such as Dell 5585

Since we already have the correct information available, just
use the actual codec name and length.
