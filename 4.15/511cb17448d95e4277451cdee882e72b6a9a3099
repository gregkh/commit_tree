mfd: tps65217: Introduce dependency on CONFIG_OF

Currently the driver boots only via device tree hence add a
dependency on CONFIG_OF. This leaves with a bunch of unused code
so clean that up. This patch also makes use of probe_new function
in place of the probe function so as to avoid passing i2c_device_id.
