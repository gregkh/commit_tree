crypto: algapi - fix NULL dereference in crypto_remove_spawns()

syzkaller triggered a NULL pointer dereference in crypto_remove_spawns()
via a program that repeatedly and concurrently requests AEADs
"authenc(cmac(des3_ede-asm),pcbc-aes-aesni)" and hashes "cmac(des3_ede)"
through AF_ALG, where the hashes are requested as "untested"
(CRYPTO_ALG_TESTED is set in ->salg_mask but clear in ->salg_feat; this
causes the template to be instantiated for every request).

Although AF_ALG users really shouldn't be able to request an "untested"
algorithm, the NULL pointer dereference is actually caused by a
longstanding race condition where crypto_remove_spawns() can encounter
an instance which has had spawn(s) "grabbed" but hasn't yet been
registered, resulting in ->cra_users still being NULL.

We probably should properly initialize ->cra_users earlier, but that
would require updating many templates individually.  For now just fix
the bug in a simple way that can easily be backported: make
crypto_remove_spawns() treat a NULL ->cra_users list as empty.
