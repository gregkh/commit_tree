tracing: Allocate mask_str buffer dynamically

The default NR_CPUS can be very large, but actual possible nr_cpu_ids
usually is very small. For my x86 distribution, the NR_CPUS is 8192 and
nr_cpu_ids is 4. About 2 pages are wasted.

Most machines don't have so many CPUs, so define a array with NR_CPUS
just wastes memory. So let's allocate the buffer dynamically when need.

With this change, the mutext tracing_cpumask_update_lock also can be
removed now, which was used to protect mask_str.
