drm/amd/display: Fix MST physical ports always disconnected

Remove a false assumption that a cached EDID will be present whenever
the connector is in a connected state as this will only be true for
logical MST ports. For physical ports the EDID will never be cached,
which will cause them to always appear as disconnected.
