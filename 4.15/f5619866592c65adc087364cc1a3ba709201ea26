net: dsa: remove copy of master ethtool_ops

There is no need to store a copy of the master ethtool ops, storing the
original pointer in DSA and the new one in the master netdev itself is
enough.

In the meantime, set orig_ethtool_ops to NULL when restoring the master
ethtool ops and check the presence of the master original ethtool ops as
well as its needed functions before calling them.
