drm/i915: add support for 64K scratch page

Before we can fully enable 64K pages, we need to first support a 64K
scratch page if we intend to support the case where we have object sizes
< 2M, since any scratch PTE must also point to a 64K region.  Without
this our 64K usage is limited to objects which completely fill the
page-table, and therefore don't need any scratch.
