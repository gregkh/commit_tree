x86/ldt: Plug memory leak in error path

The error path in write_ldt() tries to free 'old_ldt' instead of the newly
allocated 'new_ldt', resulting in a memory leak. It also misses to clean up a
half populated LDT pagetable, which is not a leak as it gets cleaned up
when the process exits.

Free both the potentially half populated LDT pagetable and the newly
allocated LDT struct. This can be done unconditionally because once an LDT
is mapped subsequent maps will succeed, because the PTE page is already
populated and the two LDTs fit into that single page.
