tools/power/cpupower: Add 64 bit library detection

The kernel-tools-lib rpm is installing the library to /usr/lib64, and not
/usr/lib as the cpupower Makefile is doing in the kernel tree.  This
resulted in a conflict between the two libraries.  After looking at how
other tools installed libraries, and looking at the perf code in
tools/perf it looks like installing to /usr/lib64 for 64-bit arches is the
correct thing to do.

Checks with 'ldd cpupower' on SLES, RHEL, Fedora, and Ubuntu result in
the correct binary AFAICT:

[root@testsystem cpupower]# ldd cpupower | grep cpupower
        libcpupower.so.0 => /lib64/libcpupower.so.0 (0x00007f1dab447000)

Commit ac5a181d065d ("cpupower: Add cpuidle parts into library") added a
new cpupower library version.  On Fedora, executing the cpupower binary
then resulted in this error

[root@testsystem cpupower]# ./cpupower monitor
./cpupower: symbol lookup error: ./cpupower: undefined symbol:
get_cpu_topology

64-bit libraries should be installed to /usr/lib64, and other libraries
should be installed to /usr/lib.

This code was taken from the perf Makefile.config which supports /usr/lib
and /usr/lib64.
