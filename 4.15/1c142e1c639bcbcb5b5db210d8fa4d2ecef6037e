i40e: rename 'cmd' variables in ethtool interface

After the switch to the new ethtool API, ethtool passes us
ethtool_ksettings structs instead of ethtool_command structs, however we
were still referring to them as 'cmd' variables.  This renames them to
'ks' variables which makes the code easier to understand.
