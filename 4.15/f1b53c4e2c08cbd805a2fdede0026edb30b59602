gpu: host1x: Add Tegra186 support

Add support for the implementation of Host1x present on the Tegra186.
The register space has been shuffled around a little bit, requiring
addition of some chip-specific code sections. Tegra186 also adds
several new features, most importantly the hypervisor, but those are
not yet supported with this commit.
