bnxt_en: Fix IRQ coalescing regression.

Recent IRQ coalescing clean up has removed a guard-rail for the max DMA
buffer coalescing value.  This is a 6-bit value and must not be 0.  We
already have a check for 0 but 64 is equivalent to 0 and will cause
non-stop interrupts.  Fix it by adding the proper check.
