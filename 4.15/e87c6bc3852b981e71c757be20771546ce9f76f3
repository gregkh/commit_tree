bpf: permit multiple bpf attachments for a single perf event

This patch enables multiple bpf attachments for a
kprobe/uprobe/tracepoint single trace event.
Each trace_event keeps a list of attached perf events.
When an event happens, all attached bpf programs will
be executed based on the order of attachment.

A global bpf_event_mutex lock is introduced to protect
prog_array attaching and detaching. An alternative will
be introduce a mutex lock in every trace_event_call
structure, but it takes a lot of extra memory.
So a global bpf_event_mutex lock is a good compromise.

The bpf prog detachment involves allocation of memory.
If the allocation fails, a dummy do-nothing program
will replace to-be-detached program in-place.
