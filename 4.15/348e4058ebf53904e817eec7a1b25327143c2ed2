drm/i915/bios: parse DDI ports also for CHV for HDMI DDC pin and DP AUX channel

While technically CHV isn't DDI, we do look at the VBT based DDI port
info for HDMI DDC pin and DP AUX channel. (We call these "alternate",
but they're really just something that aren't platform defaults.)

In commit e4ab73a13291 ("drm/i915: Respect alternate_ddc_pin for all DDI
ports") Ville writes, "IIRC there may be CHV system that might actually
need this."

I'm not sure why there couldn't be even more platforms that need this,
but start conservative, and parse the info for CHV in addition to DDI.
