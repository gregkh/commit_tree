lightnvm: pblk: check lba sanity on read path

As part of pblk's recovery scheme, we store the lba mapped to each
physical sector on the device's out-of-bound (OOB) area.

On the read path, we can use this information to validate that the data
being delivered to the upper layers corresponds to the lba being
requested. The cost of this check is an extra copy on the DMA region on
the device and an extra comparison in the host, given that (i) the OOB
area is being read together with the data in the media, and (ii) the DMA
region allocated for the ppa list can be reused for the metadata stored
on the OOB area.
