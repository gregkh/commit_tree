sh_eth: fix SH7757 GEther initialization

Renesas  SH7757 has 2 Fast and 2 Gigabit Ether controllers, while the
'sh_eth' driver can only reset and initialize TSU of the first controller
pair. Shimoda-san tried to solve that adding the 'needs_init' member to the
'struct sh_eth_plat_data', however the platform code still never sets this
flag. I think  that we can infer this information from the 'devno' variable
(set  to 'platform_device::id') and reset/init the Ether controller pair
only for an even 'devno'; therefore 'sh_eth_plat_data::needs_init' can be
removed...
