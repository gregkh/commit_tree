cpufreq: schedutil: Use idle_calls counter of the remote CPU

Since the recent remote cpufreq callback work, its possible that a cpufreq
update is triggered from a remote CPU. For single policies however, the current
code uses the local CPU when trying to determine if the remote sg_cpu entered
idle or is busy. This is incorrect. To remedy this, compare with the nohz tick
idle_calls counter of the remote CPU.
