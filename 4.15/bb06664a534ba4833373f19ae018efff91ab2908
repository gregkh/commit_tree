f2fs: avoid race in between GC and block exchange

During block exchange in {insert,collapse,move}_range, page-block mapping
is unstable due to mapping moving or recovery, so there should be no
concurrent cache read operation rely on such mapping, nor cache write
operation to mess up block exchange.

So this patch let background GC be aware of that.
