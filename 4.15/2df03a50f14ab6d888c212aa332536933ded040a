nfp: bpf: support accessing the stack beyond 64 bytes

To access beyond 64th byte of the stack we need to set a new
stack pointer register (LMEM is accessed indirectly through
those pointers).  Add a function for encoding local CSR access
instruction.  Use stack pointer number 3.

Note that stack pointer registers allow us to index into 32
bytes of LMEM (with shift operations i.e. when operands are
restricted).  This means if access is crossing 32 byte boundary
we must not use offsetting, we have to set the pointer to the
exact address and move it with post-increments.

We depend on the datapath placing the stack base address in
GPR A22 for our use.
