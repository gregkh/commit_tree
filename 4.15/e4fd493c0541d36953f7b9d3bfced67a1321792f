Btrfs: fix stale entries in readdir

In fixing the readdir+pagefault deadlock I accidentally introduced a
stale entry regression in readdir.  If we get close to full for the
temporary buffer, and then skip a few delayed deletions, and then try to
add another entry that won't fit, we will emit the entries we found and
retry.  Unfortunately we delete entries from our del_list as we find
them, assuming we won't need them.  However our pos will be with
whatever our last entry was, which could be before the delayed deletions
we skipped, so the next search will add the deleted entries back into
our readdir buffer.  So instead don't delete entries we find in our
del_list so we can make sure we always find our delayed deletions.  This
is a slight perf hit for readdir with lots of pending deletions, but
hopefully this isn't a common occurrence.  If it is we can revist this
and optimize it.
