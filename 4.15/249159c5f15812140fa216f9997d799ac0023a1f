nvme: check hw sectors before setting chunk sectors

Some devices with IDs matching the "stripe" quirk don't actually have
this quirk, and don't have an MDTS value. When MDTS is not set, the
driver sets the max sectors to UINT_MAX, which is not a power of 2,
hitting a BUG_ON from blk_queue_chunk_sectors. This patch skips setting
chunk sectors for such devices.
