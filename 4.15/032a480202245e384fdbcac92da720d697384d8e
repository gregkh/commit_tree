ipv4: fix validate_source for VRF setup

David reported breakages of VRF scenarios due to the
commit 6e617de84e87 ("net: avoid a full fib lookup when rp_filter is
disabled."): the local addresses based test is too strict when VRFs
are in place.

With this change we fall-back to a full lookup when custom fib rules
are in place; so that we address the VRF use case and possibly other
similar issues in non trivial setups.

v1 -> v2:
 - fix build breakage when CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES is not defined,
   reported by the kbuild test robot
