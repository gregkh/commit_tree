EDAC, sb_edac: Fix missing DIMM sysfs entries with KNL SNC2/SNC4 mode

When figuring out the size of the DIMMs and the cluster mode is SNC2 or SNC4 the
current algorithm ignores the contribution of some of the channels resulting in
EDAC never knowing of the existence of some DIMMs attached to such channels (thus
sysfs is not populated).

Instead of selectively iterating from 0 to interlv_ways when looking for all the
participants in the interleave, do an exhaustive search and iterate from 0 to
KNL_MAX_CHANNELS. The algorithm is already smart enough to consider participants
only one time.

This works fine in all KNL cluster modes and even when there are missing DIMMs
as the contribution of those channels is 0.
