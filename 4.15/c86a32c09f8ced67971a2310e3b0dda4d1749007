kprobes/x86: Disable optimizing on the function jumps to indirect thunk

Since indirect jump instructions will be replaced by jump
to __x86_indirect_thunk_*, those jmp instruction must be
treated as an indirect jump. Since optprobe prohibits to
optimize probes in the function which uses an indirect jump,
it also needs to find out the function which jump to
__x86_indirect_thunk_* and disable optimization.

Add a check that the jump target address is between the
__indirect_thunk_start/end when optimizing kprobe.
