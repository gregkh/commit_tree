samples/bpf: xdp_monitor first 8 bytes are not accessible by bpf

The first 8 bytes of the tracepoint context struct are not accessible
by the bpf code.  This is a choice that dates back to the original
inclusion of this code.

See explaination in:
 commit 98b5c2c65c29 ("perf, bpf: allow bpf programs attach to tracepoints")
