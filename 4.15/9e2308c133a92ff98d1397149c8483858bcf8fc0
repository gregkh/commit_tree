tools: bpftool: print all relevant byte opcodes for "load double word"

The eBPF instruction permitting to load double words (8 bytes) into a
register need 8-byte long "immediate" field, and thus occupy twice the
space of other instructions. bpftool was aware of this and would
increment the instruction counter only once on meeting such instruction,
but it would only print the first four bytes of the immediate value to
load. Make it able to dump the whole 16 byte-long double instruction
instead (as would `llvm-objdump -d <program>`).
