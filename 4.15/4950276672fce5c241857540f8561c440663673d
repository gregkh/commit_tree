kmemcheck: remove annotations

Patch series "kmemcheck: kill kmemcheck", v2.

As discussed at LSF/MM, kill kmemcheck.

KASan is a replacement that is able to work without the limitation of
kmemcheck (single CPU, slow).  KASan is already upstream.

We are also not aware of any users of kmemcheck (or users who don't
consider KASan as a suitable replacement).

The only objection was that since KASAN wasn't supported by all GCC
versions provided by distros at that time we should hold off for 2
years, and try again.

Now that 2 years have passed, and all distros provide gcc that supports
KASAN, kill kmemcheck again for the very same reasons.

This patch (of 4):

Remove kmemcheck annotations, and calls to kmemcheck from the kernel.
