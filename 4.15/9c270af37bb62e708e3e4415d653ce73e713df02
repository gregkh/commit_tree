bpf: XDP_REDIRECT enable use of cpumap

This patch connects cpumap to the xdp_do_redirect_map infrastructure.

Still no SKB allocation are done yet.  The XDP frames are transferred
to the other CPU, but they are simply refcnt decremented on the remote
CPU.  This served as a good benchmark for measuring the overhead of
remote refcnt decrement.  If driver page recycle cache is not
efficient then this, exposes a bottleneck in the page allocator.

A shout-out to MST's ptr_ring, which is the secret behind is being so
efficient to transfer memory pointers between CPUs, without constantly
bouncing cache-lines between CPUs.

V3: Handle !CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL pointed out by kbuild test robot.

V4: Make Generic-XDP aware of cpumap type, but don't allow redirect yet,
 as implementation require a separate upstream discussion.

V5:
 - Fix a maybe-uninitialized pointed out by kbuild test robot.
 - Restrict bpf-prog side access to cpumap, open when use-cases appear
 - Implement cpu_map_enqueue() as a more simple void pointer enqueue

V6:
 - Allow cpumap type for usage in helper bpf_redirect_map,
   general bpf-prog side restriction moved to earlier patch.
