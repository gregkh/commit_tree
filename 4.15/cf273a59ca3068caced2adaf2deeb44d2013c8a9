drm/amdgpu: fix and cleanup shadow handling

Set the shadow flag on the shadow and not the parent, always bind shadow BOs
during allocation instead of manually, use the reservation_object wrappers
to grab the lock.

This fixes a couple of issues with binding the shadow BOs as well as correctly
evicting them when memory becomes tight.
