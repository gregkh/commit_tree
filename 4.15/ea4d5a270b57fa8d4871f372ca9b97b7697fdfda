dma-buf/sw_sync: force signal all unsignaled fences on dying timeline

To avoid hanging userspace components that might have been waiting on the
active fences of the destroyed timeline we need to signal with error all
remaining fences on such timeline.

This restore the default behaviour of the Android sw_sync framework, which
Android still relies on. It was broken on the dma fence conversion a few
years ago and never fixed.
