net/sched: Introduce Credit Based Shaper (CBS) qdisc

This queueing discipline implements the shaper algorithm defined by
the 802.1Q-2014 Section 8.6.8.2 and detailed in Annex L.

It's primary usage is to apply some bandwidth reservation to user
defined traffic classes, which are mapped to different queues via the
mqprio qdisc.

Only a simple software implementation is added for now.
