nvme: add duplicate_connect option

Add the "duplicate_connect" boolean option (presence means true).
Default is false.

When false, the transport should validate whether a new controller request
is targeted for the same host transport addressing and target transport
addressing as an existing controller. If so, the new controller request
should be rejected.

When true, the callee is explicitly requesting a duplicate controller
connection to be made and the new request should be attempted.
