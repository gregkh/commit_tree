KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Move kvm_vgic_destroy call around

The way we call kvm_vgic_destroy is a bit bizarre. We call it
*after* having freed the vcpus, which sort of defeats the point
of cleaning up things before that point.

Let's move kvm_vgic_destroy towards the beginning of kvm_arch_destroy_vm,
which seems more sensible.
