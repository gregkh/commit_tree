bpf: revert report offload info to user space

This reverts commit bd601b6ada11 ("bpf: report offload info to user
space").  The ifindex by itself is not sufficient, we should provide
information on which network namespace this ifindex belongs to.
After considering some options we concluded that it's best to just
remove this API for now, and rework it in -next.
