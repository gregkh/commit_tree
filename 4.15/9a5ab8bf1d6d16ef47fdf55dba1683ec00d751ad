tools: bpftool: turn err() and info() macros into functions

Turn err() and info() macros into functions.

In order to avoid naming conflicts with variables in the code, rename
them as p_err() and p_info() respectively.

The behavior of these functions is similar to the one of the macros for
plain output. However, when JSON output is requested, these macros
return a JSON-formatted "error" object instead of printing a message to
stderr.

To handle error messages correctly with JSON, a modification was brought
to their behavior nonetheless: the functions now append a end-of-line
character at the end of the message. This way, we can remove end-of-line
characters at the end of the argument strings, and not have them in the
JSON output.

All error messages are formatted to hold in a single call to p_err(), in
order to produce a single JSON field.
