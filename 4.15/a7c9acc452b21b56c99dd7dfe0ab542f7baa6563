brcmfmac: Delete redundant length check

brcmf_fweh_process_event() sets event->datalen to the
endian-swapped value of event_packet->msg.datalen, which is the
same as emsg.datalen.  This length is already validated in
brcmf_fweh_process_event(), so there is no need to check it
again upon dequeuing the event.
