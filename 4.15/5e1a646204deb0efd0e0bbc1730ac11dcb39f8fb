crypto: crc32-pclmul - remove useless relative addressing

In 32-bit mode, the x86 architecture can hold full 32-bit pointers.
Therefore, the code that copies the current address to the %ecx register
and uses %ecx-relative addressing is useless, we could just use absolute
addressing.

The processors have a stack of return addresses for branch prediction. If
we use a call instruction and pop the return address, it desynchronizes
the return stack and causes branch prediction misses.

This patch also moves the data to the .rodata section.
