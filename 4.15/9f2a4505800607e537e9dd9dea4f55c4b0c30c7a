xfs: fix log block underflow during recovery cycle verification

It is possible for mkfs to format very small filesystems with too
small of an internal log with respect to the various minimum size
and block count requirements. If this occurs when the log happens to
be smaller than the scan window used for cycle verification and the
scan wraps the end of the log, the start_blk calculation in
xlog_find_head() underflows and leads to an attempt to scan an
invalid range of log blocks. This results in log recovery failure
and a failed mount.

Since there may be filesystems out in the wild with this kind of
geometry, we cannot simply refuse to mount. Instead, cap the scan
window for cycle verification to the size of the physical log. This
ensures that the cycle verification proceeds as expected when the
scan wraps the end of the log.
