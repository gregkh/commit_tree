drm/i915/execlists: Split insert_request()

In the next patch we will want to reinsert a request not at the end of
the priority queue, but at the front. Here we split insert_request()
into two, the first function retrieves the priority list (for reuse for
unsubmit later) and a wrapper function to insert at the end of that list
and to schedule the tasklet if we were first.
