tun: free skb in early errors

tun_recvmsg() supports accepting skb by msg_control after
commit ac77cfd4258f ("tun: support receiving skb through msg_control"),
the skb if presented should be freed no matter how far it can go
along, otherwise it would be leaked.

This patch fixes several missed cases.
