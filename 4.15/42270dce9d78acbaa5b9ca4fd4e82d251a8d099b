scsi: lpfc: Disable NPIV support if NVME is enabled

The initial implementation of NVME didn't merge with NPIV support.  As
such, there are several issues if NPIV is used with NVME. For now,
ensure that if NVME is enabled then NPIV is not enabled.

Support for NPIV with NVME will be added in the near future.
