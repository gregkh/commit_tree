powerpc/vphn: Improve recognition of PRRN/VPHN

powerpc/vphn: On Power systems with shared configurations of CPUs
and memory, there are some issues with the association of additional
CPUs and memory to nodes when hot-adding resources.  This patch
updates the initialization checks to independently recognize PRRN
or VPHN support.
