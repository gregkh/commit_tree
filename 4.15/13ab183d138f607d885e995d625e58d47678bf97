mm/kmemleak.c: make cond_resched() rate-limiting more efficient

Commit bde5f6bc68db ("kmemleak: add scheduling point to
kmemleak_scan()") tries to rate-limit the frequency of cond_resched()
calls, but does it in a way which might incur an expensive division
operation in the inner loop.  Simplify this.
