l2tp: remove the .tunnel_sock field from struct pppol2tp_session

The last user of .tunnel_sock is pppol2tp_connect() which defensively
uses it to verify internal data consistency.

This check isn't necessary: l2tp_session_get() guarantees that the
returned session belongs to the tunnel passed as parameter. And
.tunnel_sock is never updated, so checking that it still points to
the parent tunnel socket is useless; that test can never fail.
