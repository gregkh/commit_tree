vgaarb: Factor out EFI and fallback default device selection

The default VGA device is normally set in vga_arbiter_add_pci_device() when
we call it for the first enabled device that can be accessed with the
legacy VGA resources ([mem 0xa0000-0xbffff], etc.)

That default device can be overridden by an EFI device that owns the boot
framebuffer.  As a fallback, we can also select a VGA device that can't be
accessed via legacy VGA resources, or a VGA device that isn't even enabled.

Factor out this EFI and fallback selection from vga_arb_device_init() into
a separate vga_arb_select_default_device() function.  This doesn't change
any behavior, but it untangles the "bridge control possible" checking and
messages from the default device selection.
