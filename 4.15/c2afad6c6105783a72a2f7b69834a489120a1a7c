crypto: s5p-sss - Add HASH support for Exynos

Add support for MD5, SHA1, SHA256 hash algorithms for Exynos HW.
It uses the crypto framework asynchronous hash api.
It is based on omap-sham.c driver.
S5P has some HW differencies and is not implemented.

Modifications in s5p-sss:

- Add hash supporting structures and functions.

- Modify irq handler to handle both aes and hash signals.

- Resize resource end in probe if EXYNOS_HASH is enabled in
  Kconfig.

- Add new copyright line and new author.

- Tested on Odroid-U3 with Exynos 4412 CPU, kernel 4.13-rc6
  with crypto run-time self test testmgr
  and with tcrypt module with: modprobe tcrypt sec=1 mode=N
  where N=402, 403, 404 (MD5, SHA1, SHA256).

Modifications in drivers/crypto/Kconfig:

- Add new CRYPTO_DEV_EXYNOS_HASH, depend on !EXYNOS_RNG
  and CRYPTO_DEV_S5P

- Select sw algorithms MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 in EXYNOS_HASH
  as they are needed for fallback.
