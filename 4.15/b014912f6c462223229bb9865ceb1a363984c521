pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7796: Add support for INTC-EX IRQ pins

Most pins on the r8a7796 SoC can be configured in GPIO mode for
interrupt and GPIO functionality, while a couple of them can also
be routed to the INTC-EX hardware block (formerly known as IRQC).

On r8a7795 the INTC-EX hardware handles pins IRQ0 -> IRQ5 and
this patch adds support for them to the PFC driver as "intc_ex_irqN".
