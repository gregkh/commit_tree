kvm: arm: don't treat unavailable HYP mode as an error

Since it is perfectly legal to run the kernel at EL1, it is not
actually an error if HYP mode is not available when attempting to
initialize KVM, given that KVM support cannot be built as a module.
So demote the kvm_err() to kvm_info(), which prevents the error from
appearing on an otherwise 'quiet' console.
