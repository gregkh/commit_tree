drm: handle override and firmware EDID at drm_do_get_edid() level

Handle debugfs override edid and firmware edid at the low level to
transparently and completely replace the real edid. Previously, we
practically only used the modes from the override EDID, and none of the
other data, such as audio parameters.

This change also prevents actual EDID reads when the EDID is to be
overridden, but retains the DDC probe. This is useful if the reason for
preferring override EDID are problems with reading the data, or
corruption of the data.

Move firmware EDID loading from helper to core, as the functionality
moves to lower level as well. This will result in a change of module
parameter from drm_kms_helper.edid_firmware to drm.edid_firmware, which
arguably makes more sense anyway.

Some future work remains related to override and firmware EDID
validation. Like before, no validation is done for override EDID. The
firmware EDID is validated separately in the loader. Some unification
and deduplication would be in order, to validate all of them at the
drm_do_get_edid() level, like "real" EDIDs.

v2: move firmware loading to core

v3: rebase, commit message refresh
