arm64: mm: cleanup stale AIVIVT references

Since commit:

  155433cb365ee466 ("arm64: cache: Remove support for ASID-tagged VIVT I-caches")

... the kernel no longer cares about AIVIVT I-caches, as these were
removed from the architecture.

This patch removes the stale references to such I-caches.

The comment in flush_context() is also updated to clarify when and where
the TLB invalidation occurs.
