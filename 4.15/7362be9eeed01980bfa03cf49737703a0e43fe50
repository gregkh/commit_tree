i40e: reduce lrxqthresh from 2 to 1

The lrxq thresh value tells hardware to immediately interrupt when there
are fewer than N*64 packets left in the ring.

Counter intuitively, empirical testing has shown that decreasing this
value from 2 to 1, and thus changing from an immediate interrupt at
fewer than 128 descriptors down to 64 descriptors causes a small
increase in the maximum total packets per second we can receive. This
increase occurs even when we're polling with interrupts masked, as the
hardware must still handle interrupts internally even if we've disabled
them in software.

Also reduce the value for any VFs we allocate.
