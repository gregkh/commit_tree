mm, hugetlbfs: introduce ->split() to vm_operations_struct

Patch series "device-dax: fix unaligned munmap handling"

When device-dax is operating in huge-page mode we want it to behave like
hugetlbfs and fail attempts to split vmas into unaligned ranges.  It
would be messy to teach the munmap path about device-dax alignment
constraints in the same (hstate) way that hugetlbfs communicates this
constraint.  Instead, these patches introduce a new ->split() vm
operation.

This patch (of 2):

The device-dax interface has similar constraints as hugetlbfs in that it
requires the munmap path to unmap in huge page aligned units.  Rather
than add more custom vma handling code in __split_vma() introduce a new
vm operation to perform this vma specific check.
