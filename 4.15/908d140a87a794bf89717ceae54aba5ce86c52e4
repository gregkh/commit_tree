ip6_tunnel: Allow rcv/xmit even if remote address is a local address

Currently, ip6_tnl_xmit_ctl drops tunneled packets if the remote
address (outer v6 destination) is one of host's locally configured
addresses.
Same applies to ip6_tnl_rcv_ctl: it drops packets if the remote address
(outer v6 source) is a local address.

This prevents using ipxip6 (and ip6_gre) tunnels whose local/remote
endpoints are on same host; OTOH v4 tunnels (ipip or gre) allow such
configurations.

An example where this proves useful is a system where entities are
identified by their unique v6 addresses, and use tunnels to encapsulate
traffic between them. The limitation prevents placing several entities
on same host.

Introduce IP6_TNL_F_ALLOW_LOCAL_REMOTE which allows to bypass this
restriction.
