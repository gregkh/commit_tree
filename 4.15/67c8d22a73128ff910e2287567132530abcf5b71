openvswitch: fix the incorrect flow action alloc size

If we want to add a datapath flow, which has more than 500 vxlan outputs'
action, we will get the following error reports:
  openvswitch: netlink: Flow action size 32832 bytes exceeds max
  openvswitch: netlink: Flow action size 32832 bytes exceeds max
  openvswitch: netlink: Actions may not be safe on all matching packets
  ... ...

It seems that we can simply enlarge the MAX_ACTIONS_BUFSIZE to fix it, but
this is not the root cause. For example, for a vxlan output action, we need
about 60 bytes for the nlattr, but after it is converted to the flow
action, it only occupies 24 bytes. This means that we can still support
more than 1000 vxlan output actions for a single datapath flow under the
the current 32k max limitation.

So even if the nla_len(attr) is larger than MAX_ACTIONS_BUFSIZE, we
shouldn't report EINVAL and keep it move on, as the judgement can be
done by the reserve_sfa_size.
