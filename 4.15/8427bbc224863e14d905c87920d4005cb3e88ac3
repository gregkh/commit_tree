nvme-pci: disable APST on Samsung SSD 960 EVO + ASUS PRIME B350M-A

The NVMe device in question drops off the PCIe bus after system suspend.
I've tried several approaches to workaround this issue, but none of them
works:
- NVME_QUIRK_DELAY_BEFORE_CHK_RDY
- NVME_QUIRK_NO_DEEPEST_PS
- Disable APST before controller shutdown
- Delay between controller shutdown and system suspend
- Explicitly set power state to 0 before controller shutdown

Fortunately it's a desktop, so disable APST won't hurt the battery.

Also, change the quirk function name to reflect it's for vendor
combination quirks.
