Revert "workqueue: respect isolated cpus when queueing an unbound work"

This reverts commit b5149873a0c299195b5346fe4dc2c5b04ae2f995.

It conflicts with the following isolcpus change from the sched branch.

 edb9382175c3 ("sched/isolation: Move isolcpus= handling to the housekeeping code")

Let's revert for now.
