scsi: aacraid: Perform initialization reset only once

Currently the driver accepts two ways of requesting an initialization
reset on the adapter: by passing aac_reset_devices module parameter,
or the generic kernel parameter reset_devices.

It's working as intended...but if we end up reaching a scsi hang and
the scsi EH mechanism takes place, aacraid performs resets as part of
the scsi error recovery procedure. These EH routines might reinitialize
the device, and if we have provided some of the reset parameters in the
kernel command-line, we again perform an "initialization" reset.

So, to avoid this duplication of resets in case of scsi EH path, this
patch adds a field to aac_dev struct to keep per-adapter track of the
init reset request - once it's done, we set it to false and don't
proactively reset anymore in case of reinitializations.
