ovl: change order of setup in ovl_fill_super()

Move ovl_get_upper() immediately after ovl_get_upperpath(),
ovl_get_workdir() immediately after ovl_get_workdir() and
ovl_get_lower_layers() immediately after ovl_get_lowerstack().

Also move prepare_creds() up to where other allocations are happening.
