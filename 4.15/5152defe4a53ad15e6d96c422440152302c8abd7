drm/i915/preempt: Default to disabled mid-command preemption levels

Supporting fine-granularity preemption levels may require changes in
userspace batch buffer programming. Therefore, we need to fallback to
safe default values, rather that use hardware defaults. Userspace is
still able to enable fine-granularity, since we're whitelisting the
register controlling it in WaEnablePreemptionGranularityControlByUMD.

v2: Extend w/a to cover Cannonlake
v3: Fix commentary to include both fake w/a names.
