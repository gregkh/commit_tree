lightnvm: pblk: consider bad sectors in emeta during recovery

When recovering lines we need to consider that bad blocks in a line
affect the emeta area size.

Previously it was assumed that the emeta area would grow by the
number of sectors per page * number of bad blocks in the line.

This assumption is not correct - the number of "extra" pages that are
consumed could be both smaller (depending on emeta size) and bigger
(depending on the placement of the bad blocks).

Fix this by calculating the emeta start by iterating backwards
through the line, skipping ppas that map to bad blocks.

Also fix the data types used for ppa indices/counts in
pblk_recov_l2p_from_emeta - we should use u64.
