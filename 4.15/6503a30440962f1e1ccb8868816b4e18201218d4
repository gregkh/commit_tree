net: ipv4: Make "ip route get" match iif lo rules again.

Commit 3765d35ed8b9 ("net: ipv4: Convert inet_rtm_getroute to rcu
versions of route lookup") broke "ip route get" in the presence
of rules that specify iif lo.

Host-originated traffic always has iif lo, because
ip_route_output_key_hash and ip6_route_output_flags set the flow
iif to LOOPBACK_IFINDEX. Thus, putting "iif lo" in an ip rule is a
convenient way to select only originated traffic and not forwarded
traffic.

inet_rtm_getroute used to match these rules correctly because
even though it sets the flow iif to 0, it called
ip_route_output_key which overwrites iif with LOOPBACK_IFINDEX.
But now that it calls ip_route_output_key_hash_rcu, the ifindex
will remain 0 and not match the iif lo in the rule. As a result,
"ip route get" will return ENETUNREACH.
