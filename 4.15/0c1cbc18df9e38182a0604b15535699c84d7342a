perf/core: Fix perf_event_read()

perf_event_read() has a number of issues regarding the timekeeping bits.

 - The IPI didn't update group times when it found INACTIVE

 - The direct call would not re-check ->state after taking ctx->lock
   which can result in ->count and timestamps getting out of sync.

And we can make use of the ordering introduced for perf_event_stop()
to make it more accurate for ACTIVE.
