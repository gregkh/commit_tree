i40e: fix u64 division usage

Commit 52eb1ff93e98 ("i40e: Add support setting TC max bandwidth rates")
and commit 1ea6f21ae530 ("i40e: Refactor VF BW rate limiting") add some
needed functionality for TC bandwidth rate limiting.  Unfortunately they
introduce several usages of unsigned 64-bit division which needs to be
handled special by the kernel to support all architectures.

Fixes: 52eb1ff93e98 ("i40e: Add support setting TC max bandwidth
rates")
Fixes: 1ea6f21ae530 ("i40e: Refactor VF BW rate limiting")
