i40e: convert i40e_set_link_ksettings to new API

This finishes off the conversion to the new ethtool API by removing the
old macros being used in i40e_set_link_ksettings and replacing them with
shiny new ones.

This conversion also allows us to provide link speed support for new 25G
and 10G macros which is included here as well.
