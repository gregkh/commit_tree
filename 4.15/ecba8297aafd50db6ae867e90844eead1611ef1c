KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Always flush TLB in kvmppc_alloc_reset_hpt()

The KVM_PPC_ALLOCATE_HTAB ioctl(), implemented by kvmppc_alloc_reset_hpt()
is supposed to completely clear and reset a guest's Hashed Page Table (HPT)
allocating or re-allocating it if necessary.

In the case where an HPT of the right size already exists and it just
zeroes it, it forces a TLB flush on all guest CPUs, to remove any stale TLB
entries loaded from the old HPT.

However, that situation can arise when the HPT is resizing as well - or
even when switching from an RPT to HPT - so those cases need a TLB flush as
well.

So, move the TLB flush to trigger in all cases except for errors.
