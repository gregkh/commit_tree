mm/page_owner.c: reduce page_owner structure size

Maximum page order can be at max 10 which can be accomodated in short
data type(2 bytes).  last_migrate_reason is defined as enum type whose
values can be accomodated in short data type (2 bytes).

Total structure size is currently 16 bytes but after changing structure
size it goes to 12 bytes.

 "Looks like it works, so why not.
  Before:
  [    0.001000] allocated 50331648 bytes of page_ext
  After:
  [    0.001000] allocated 41943040 bytes of page_ext"
