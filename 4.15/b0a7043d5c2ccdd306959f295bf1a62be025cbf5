ASoC: fsl_ssi: Caculate bit clock rate using slot number and width

The set_sysclk() now is used to override the output bit clock rate.
But this is not a common way to implement a set_dai_sysclk(). And
this creates a problem when a general machine driver (simple-card
for example) tries to do set_dai_sysclk() by passing an input clock
rate for the baud clock instead of setting the bit clock rate as
fsl_ssi driver expected.

So this patch solves this problem by firstly removing set_sysclk()
since the hw_params() can calculate the bit clock rate. Secondly,
in order not to break those TDM use cases which previously might
have been using set_sysclk() to override the bit clock rate, this
patch changes the driver to calculate the bit clock rate using the
slot number and the slot width from the via set_tdm_slot().

The patch also removes an obsolete comment of the dir parameter.
