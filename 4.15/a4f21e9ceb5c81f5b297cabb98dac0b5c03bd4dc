clk: samsung: Remove obsolete clkdev alias support

Remove support for obsolete clkdev alias definition in generic helper
macros for MUX, DIV, GATE and PLL clocks. clkdev aliases can be still
created using samsung_clk_register_alias() function if given platform
still needs them. All current drivers have been converted not to use
*_A-style macros and checked if there are any clients for the PLL
clocks, which had aliases created unconditionally.
