openrisc: add tick timer multi-core sync logic

In case timers are not in sync when cpus start (i.e. hot plug / offset
resets) we need to synchronize the secondary cpus internal timer with
the main cpu.  This is needed as in OpenRISC SMP there is only one
clocksource registered which reads from the same ttcr register on each
cpu.

This synchronization routine heavily borrows from mips implementation that
does something similar.
