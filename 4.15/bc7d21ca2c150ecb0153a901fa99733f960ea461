staging: wilc1000: replace redundant computations with 0

Shifting and masking strHostIfSetMulti->enabled is redundant since
enabled is a bool and so all the shifted and masked values will be
zero. Replace them with zero to simplify the code.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1339458 ("Bad shift operation") and
CID#1339506 ("Operands don't affect result").
