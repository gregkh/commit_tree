block: Rework drivers/cdrom/Makefile

Instead of referring from inside drivers/cdrom/Makefile to all the
drivers that use this driver, let these drivers select the cdrom
driver. This change makes the cdrom build code follow the approach
that is used for most other drivers, namely refer from the higher
layers to the lower layer instead of from the lower layer to the
higher layers.
