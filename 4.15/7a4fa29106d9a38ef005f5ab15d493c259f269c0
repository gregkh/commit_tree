net: sched: Add TCA_HW_OFFLOAD

Qdiscs can be offloaded to HW, but current implementation isn't uniform.
Instead, qdiscs either pass information about offload status via their
TCA_OPTIONS or omit it altogether.

Introduce a new attribute - TCA_HW_OFFLOAD that would form a uniform
uAPI for the offloading status of qdiscs.
