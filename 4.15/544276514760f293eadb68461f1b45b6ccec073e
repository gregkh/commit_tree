drm/amd/display: Fix MST daisy chain SST not light up

In SST daisy chain scenario, edid is getting read in mst hotplug
routine. It is getting conflict with drm send_enum_path_resources
kernel thread in terms of i2c bus which is getting locked up in
such case.

Have edid being read in get_mode hook, instead of in hotplug
routine.
