KVM: SVM: unconditionally wake up VCPU on IOMMU interrupt

Checking the mode is unnecessary, and is done without a memory barrier
separating the LAPIC write from the vcpu->mode read; in addition,
kvm_vcpu_wake_up is already doing a check for waiters on the wait queue
that has the same effect.

In practice it's safe because spin_lock has full-barrier semantics on x86,
but don't be too clever.
