ipv4: fib: Fix metrics match when deleting a route

The recently added fib_metrics_match() causes a regression for routes
with both RTAX_FEATURES and RTAX_CC_ALGO if the latter has
TCP_CONG_NEEDS_ECN flag set:

| # ip link add d0 type dummy
| # ip link set d0 up
| # ip route add 172.29.29.0/24 dev d0 features ecn congctl dctcp
| # ip route del 172.29.29.0/24 dev d0 features ecn congctl dctcp
| RTNETLINK answers: No such process

During route insertion, fib_convert_metrics() detects that the given CC
algo requires ECN and hence sets DST_FEATURE_ECN_CA bit in
RTAX_FEATURES.

During route deletion though, fib_metrics_match() compares stored
RTAX_FEATURES value with that from userspace (which obviously has no
knowledge about DST_FEATURE_ECN_CA) and fails.
