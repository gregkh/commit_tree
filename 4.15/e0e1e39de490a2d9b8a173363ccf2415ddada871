pinctrl: Add skew-delay pin config and bindings

Some pin controllers (such as the Gemini) can control the
expected clock skew and output delay on certain pins with a
sub-nanosecond granularity. This is typically done by shunting
in a number of double inverters in front of or behind the pin.
Make it possible to configure this with a generic binding.
