xen/pvcalls: fix unsigned less than zero error check

The check on bedata->ref is never true because ref is an unsigned
integer. Fix this by assigning signed int ret to the return of the
call to gnttab_claim_grant_reference so the -ve return can be checked.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1460358 ("Unsigned compared against 0")
