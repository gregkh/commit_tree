r8169: fix RTL8111EVL EEE and green settings

Name of functions rtl_w0w1_eri and rtl_w0w1_phy is somewhat misleading
regarding order of arguments. One could assume that w0w1 means
argument with bits to be reset comes before argument with bits to set.
However this is not the case.
So fix the order of arguments in several statements.

In addition fix EEE advertisement. The current code resets the bits
for 100BaseT and 1000BaseT EEE advertisement what is not what we want.

I have a little of a hard time to find a proper "Fixes" line as the
issue seems to have been there forever (at least it existed already
when the driver was moved to the current place in 2011).

The patch was tested on a Zotac Mini-PC with a RTL8111E-VL chip.
Before the patch EEE was disabled, now it's properly advertised and
works fine.
