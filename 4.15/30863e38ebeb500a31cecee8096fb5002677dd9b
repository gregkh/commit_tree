mtd: nand: Fix writing mtdoops to nand flash.

When mtdoops calls mtd_panic_write(), it eventually calls
panic_nand_write() in nand_base.c. In order to properly wait for the
nand chip to be ready in panic_nand_wait(), the chip must first be
selected.

When using the atmel nand flash controller, a panic would occur due to
a NULL pointer exception.
