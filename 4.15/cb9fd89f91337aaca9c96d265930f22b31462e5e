RDMA/core: avoid uninitialized variable warning in create_udata

As Dan pointed out, the rework I did makes it harder for smatch and other
static checkers to figure out what is going on with the uninitialized
pointers.

By open-coding the call in create_udata(), we make it more readable for
both humans and tools.
