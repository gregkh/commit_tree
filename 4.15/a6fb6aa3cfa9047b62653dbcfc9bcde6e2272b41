hv_netvsc: Set tx_table to equal weight after subchannels open

In some cases, like internal vSwitch, the host doesn't provide
send indirection table updates. This patch sets the table to be
equal weight after subchannels are all open. Otherwise, all workload
will be on one TX channel.

As tested, this patch has largely increased the throughput over
internal vSwitch.
