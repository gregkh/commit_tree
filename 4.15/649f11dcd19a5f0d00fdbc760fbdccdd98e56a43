bpf: offload: limit offload to cls_bpf and xdp programs only

We are currently only allowing attachment of device-bound
cls_bpf and XDP programs.  Make this restriction explicit in
the BPF offload code.  This way we can potentially reuse the
ifindex field in the future.

Since XDP and cls_bpf programs can only be loaded by admin,
we can drop the explicit capability check from offload code.
