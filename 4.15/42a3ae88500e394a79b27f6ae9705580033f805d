drm/i915: Organize GEN features inheritance.

As Chris noticed the current organization is confusing
and inheritance is not clear.

So, let's split it in GEN<n>_FEATURES <cdn>_PLATFORM
where new GEN inherit features from previous gens and
Platforms only use gen features plus what ever is specific
for that platform and shouldn't be passed on.
