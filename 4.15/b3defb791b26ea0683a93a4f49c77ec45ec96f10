ALSA: seq: Make ioctls race-free

The ALSA sequencer ioctls have no protection against racy calls while
the concurrent operations may lead to interfere with each other.  As
reported recently, for example, the concurrent calls of setting client
pool with a combination of write calls may lead to either the
unkillable dead-lock or UAF.

As a slightly big hammer solution, this patch introduces the mutex to
make each ioctl exclusive.  Although this may reduce performance via
parallel ioctl calls, usually it's not demanded for sequencer usages,
hence it should be negligible.
