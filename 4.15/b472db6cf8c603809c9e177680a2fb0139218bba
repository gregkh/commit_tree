arm64: efi: Add missing Kconfig dependency on KERNEL_MODE_NEON

The EFI runtime services ABI permits calls to EFI to clobber
certain FPSIMD/NEON registers, as per the AArch64 procedure call
standard.

Saving/restoring the clobbered registers around such calls needs
KERNEL_MODE_NEON, but the dependency is missing from Kconfig.

This patch adds the missing dependency.

This will aid bisection of the patches implementing support for the
ARM Scalable Vector Extension (SVE).
