ima: check signature enforcement against cmdline param instead of CONFIG

When the user requests MODULE_CHECK policy and its kernel is compiled
with CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE not set, all modules would not load, just
those loaded in initram time. One option the user would have would be
set a kernel cmdline param (module.sig_enforce) to true, but the IMA
module check code doesn't rely on this value, it checks just
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE.

This patch solves this problem checking for the exported value of
module.sig_enforce cmdline param intead of CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE,
which holds the effective value (CONFIG || param).
