xfs: create an ioctl to scrub AG metadata

Create an ioctl that can be used to scrub internal filesystem metadata.
The new ioctl takes the metadata type, an (optional) AG number, an
(optional) inode number and generation, and a flags argument.  This will
be used by the upcoming XFS online scrub tool.
