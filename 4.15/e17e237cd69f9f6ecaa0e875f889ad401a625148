ARM: dts: sunxi: Convert to CCU index macros for HDMI controller

When the HDMI controller device node was added, the needed PLL clock
macros were not exported. A separate patch addresses that, but it is
merged through a different tree.

Now that both patches are in mainline proper, we can convert the raw
numbers to proper macros.
