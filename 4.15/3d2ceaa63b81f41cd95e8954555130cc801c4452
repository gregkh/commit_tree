atm: idt77252: Convert timers to use timer_setup()

In preparation for unconditionally passing the struct timer_list pointer to
all timer callbacks, switch to using the new timer_setup() and from_timer()
to pass the timer pointer explicitly. This required adding a pointer back
to vc_map, and adjusting the locking around removal a bit.
