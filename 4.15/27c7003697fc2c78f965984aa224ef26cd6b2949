dm crypt: fix crash by adding missing check for auth key size

If dm-crypt uses authenticated mode with separate MAC, there are two
concatenated part of the key structure - key(s) for encryption and
authentication key.

Add a missing check for authenticated key length.  If this key length is
smaller than actually provided key, dm-crypt now properly fails instead
of crashing.
