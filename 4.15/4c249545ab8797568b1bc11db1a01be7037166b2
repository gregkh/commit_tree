staging: rtl8723bs: convert type to bool

Here the variable bips_processing is always supplied a bool value
while inside struct definition it is defined as an uint type.
Fix it by defining bips_processing a bool type.

Also a restore_iqk_rst = (pwrpriv->bips_processing == true) is same
as restore_iqk_rst = pwrpriv->bips_processing
