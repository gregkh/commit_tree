net: mroute: Check if rule is a default rule

When the ipmr starts, it adds one default FIB rule that matches all packets
and sends them to the DEFAULT (multicast) FIB table. A more complex rule
can be added by user to specify that for a specific interface, a packet
should be look up at either an arbitrary table or according to the l3mdev
of the interface.

For drivers willing to offload the ipmr logic into a hardware but don't
want to offload all the FIB rules functionality, provide a function that
can indicate whether the FIB rule is the default multicast rule, thus only
one routing table is needed.

This way, a driver can register to the FIB notification chain, get
notifications about FIB rules added and trigger some kind of an internal
abort mechanism when a non default rule is added by the user.
