ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: add MCLK, quirks and cleanups

Same as for other codecs, enable MCLK by default. When it is not
present, e.g. on MinnowBoard B3 since it's not routed on the LSE
connector, we fall back to blck-based clocking.

The DMIC quirks are also fixed, there is a single DMIC input of the
codec.
