bpf: sockmap missing NULL psock check

Add psock NULL check to handle a racing sock event that can get the
sk_callback_lock before this case but after xchg happens causing the
refcnt to hit zero and sock user data (psock) to be null and queued
for garbage collection.

Also add a comment in the code because this is a bit subtle and
not obvious in my opinion.
