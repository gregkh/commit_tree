md-cluster: Use a small window for raid10 resync

Suspending the entire device for resync could take
too long. Resync in small chunks.

cluster's resync window is maintained in r10conf as
cluster_sync_low and cluster_sync_high, and processed
in raid10's sync_request(). If the current resync is
outside the cluster resync window:

1. Set the cluster_sync_low to curr_resync_completed.
2. Set cluster_sync_high to cluster_sync_low + stripe
   size.
3. Send a message to all nodes so they may add it in
   their suspension list.

Note:
We only support "near" raid10 so far, resync a far or
offset raid10 array could have trouble. So raid10_run
checks the layout of clustered raid10, it will refuse
to run if the layout is not correct.

With the "near" layout we process one stripe at a time
progressing monotonically through the address space.
So we can have a sliding window of whole-stripes which
moves through the array suspending IO on other nodes,
and both resync which uses array addresses and recovery
which uses device addresses can stay within this window.
