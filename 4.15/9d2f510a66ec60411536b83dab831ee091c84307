powerpc/64s/idle: avoid POWER9 DD1 and DD2.0 ERAT workaround on DD2.1

DD2.1 does not have to flush the ERAT after a state-loss idle.

Performance testing was done on a DD2.1 using only the stop0 idle state
(the shallowest state which supports state loss), using context_switch
selftest configured to ping-poing between two threads on the same core
and two different cores.

Performance improvement for same core is 7.0%, different cores is 14.8%.
