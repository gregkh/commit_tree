drm/i915: Speed up DMC firmware loading

Currently we're doing:

1. acquire lock
2. write word to hardware
3. release lock
4. repeat from 1

to load the DMC firmware. Due to the cost of acquiring/releasing a lock,
and the size of the DMC firmware, this slows down DMC loading a lot.

This patch simply acquires the lock, writes the entire firmware,
then releases the lock.  Testing shows resume speedups
in the order of 10ms on platforms with DMC firmware (GEN9+).

v2: Per feedback from Chris & Ville there's no need to do the whole
    forcewake dance, so lose that bit (Chris, Ville)

v3: Actually send the new version of the patch...

v4: Don't acquire the uncore lock. Disable preempt. (Chris)
