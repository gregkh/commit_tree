kbuild: create directory for make cache only when necessary

Currently, the existence of $(dir $(make-cache)) is always checked,
and created if it is missing.

We can avoid unnecessary system calls by some tricks.

[1] If KBUILD_SRC is unset, we are building in the source tree.
    The output directory checks can be entirely skipped.
[2] If at least one cache data is found, it means the cache file
    was included.  Obviously its directory exists.  Skip "mkdir -p".
[3] If Makefile does not contain any call of __run-and-store, it will
    not create a cache file.  No need to create its directory.
[4] The "mkdir -p" should be only invoked by the first call of
    __run-and-store
