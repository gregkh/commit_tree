media: staging: atomisp: Remove FSF snail address

Snail address is subject to change, remove it completely from the code.

This has been done using the following script:

	sed -i '/You should/,/02110-1301/d' \
		$(git grep -n -w Franklin -- drivers/staging/media/atomisp/ | cut -f1 -d:)

No functional change intended.
