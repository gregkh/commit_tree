i40e/i40evf: don't trust VF to reset itself

When using 'ethtool -L' on a VF to change number of requested queues
from PF, we shouldn't trust the VF to reset itself after making the
request.  Doing it that way opens the door for a potentially malicious
VF to do nasty things to the PF which should never be the case.

This makes it such that after VF makes a successful request, PF will
then reset the VF to institute required changes.  Only if the request
fails will PF send a message back to VF letting it know the request was
unsuccessful.

Testing-hints:
There should be no real functional changes.  This is simply hardening
against a potentially malicious VF.
