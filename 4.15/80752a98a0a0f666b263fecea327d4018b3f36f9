i40e: Fix reporting incorrect error codes

Adding cloud filters could fail for a number of reasons,
unsupported filter fields for example, which fails during
validation of fields itself. This will not result in admin
command errors and converting the admin queue status to posix
error code using i40e_aq_rc_to_posix would result in incorrect
error values. If the failure was due to AQ error itself,
reporting that correctly is handled in the inner function.
