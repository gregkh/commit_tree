powerpc/64: Fix latency tracing for lazy irq replay

When returning from an exception to a soft-enabled context, pending
IRQs are replayed but IRQ tracing is not reset, so a number of them
can get chained together into the same IRQ-disabled trace.

Fix this by having __check_irq_replay re-set IRQ trace. This is
conceptually where we respond to the next interrupt, so it fits the
semantics of the IRQ tracer.
