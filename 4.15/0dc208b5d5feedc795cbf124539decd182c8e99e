locking/rwsem, fs: Use killable down_read() in iterate_dir()

There was mutex_lock_interruptible() initially, and it was changed
to rwsem, but there were not killable rwsem primitives that time.
>From commit 9902af79c01a:

    "The main issue is the lack of down_write_killable(), so the places
     like readdir.c switched to plain inode_lock(); once killable
     variants of rwsem primitives appear, that'll be dealt with"

Use down_read_killable() same as down_write_killable() in !shared
case, as concurrent inode_lock() may take much time, that may be
wanted to be interrupted by user.
