drm/i915/selftests: Replace wmb() with i915_gem_chipset_flush()

Currently, we are being fairly lazy and only using a wmb() following an
update to an active batch. Previously, we have found that to be
insufficient to ensure that a write from the CPU reaches memory in a
timely fashion, and in some caches we may need to flush a chipset cache.
To that end, we have i915_gem_chipset_flush() so use it.
