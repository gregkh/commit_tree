ARC: [plat-axs10x] DTS: Add reset controller node to manage ethernet reset

DW ethernet controller on axs10x hangs sometimes after SW reset.
Invoke the newly aded driver (reset-axs10x.c) by adding the DT bits.

With this in place, we don't need the open-coded quirk in platform
code, so get rid of it as well !
