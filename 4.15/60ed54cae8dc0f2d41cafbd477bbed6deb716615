gpio: Disambiguate struct gpio_irq_chip.nested

The nested field in struct gpio_irq_chip currently has two meanings. On
one hand it marks an IRQ chip as being nested (as opposed to chained),
while on the other hand it also means that an IRQ chip uses nested
thread handlers.

However, nested IRQ chips can already be identified by the fact that
they don't pass a parent handler (the driver would instead already have
installed a nested handler using request_irq()).

Therefore, the only use for the nested attribute is to inform gpiolib
that an IRQ chip uses nested thread handlers (as opposed to regular,
non-threaded handlers). To clarify its purpose, rename the field to
"threaded".
