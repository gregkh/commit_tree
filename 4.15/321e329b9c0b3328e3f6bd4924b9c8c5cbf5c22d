IB/srpt: Post receive work requests after qp transition to INIT state

IB and iWARP specs both spell out that posting a receive work request
to a queue pair in the RESET state is an invalid operation and required
to fail.  Postpone posting receive work requests until after the
transition to the INIT state.
