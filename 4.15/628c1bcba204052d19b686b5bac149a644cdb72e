kernel/signal.c: protect the traced SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE tasks from SIGKILL

The comment in sig_ignored() says "Tracers may want to know about even
ignored signals" but SIGKILL can not be reported to debugger and it is
just wrong to return 0 in this case: SIGKILL should only kill the
SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE task if it comes from the parent ns.

Change sig_ignored() to ignore ->ptrace if sig == SIGKILL and rely on
sig_task_ignored().

SISGTOP coming from within the namespace is not really right too but at
least debugger can intercept it, and we can't drop it here because this
will break "gdb -p 1": ptrace_attach() won't work.  Perhaps we will add
another ->ptrace check later, we will see.
