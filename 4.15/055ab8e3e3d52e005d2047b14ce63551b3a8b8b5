debugfs: debugfs_real_fops(): drop __must_hold sparse annotation

Currently, debugfs_real_fops() is annotated with a
__must_hold(&debugfs_srcu) sparse annotation.

With the conversion of the SRCU based protection of users against
concurrent file removals to a per-file refcount based scheme, this becomes
wrong.

Drop this annotation.
