brcmfmac: change driver unbind order of the sdio function devices

In the function brcmf_sdio_firmware_callback() the driver is
unbound from the sdio function devices in the error path.
However, the order in which it is done resulted in a use-after-free
issue (see brcmf_ops_sdio_remove() in bcmsdh.c). Hence change
the order and first unbind sdio function #2 device and then
unbind sdio function #1 device.
