drm/amd/display: fix ifnullfree.cocci warnings

drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/gpio/gpio_service.c:134:3-8: WARNING: NULL check before freeing functions like kfree, debugfs_remove, debugfs_remove_recursive or usb_free_urb is not needed. Maybe consider reorganizing relevant code to avoid passing NULL values.
