powerpc/64s: Wire up cpu_show_meltdown()

The recent commit 87590ce6e373 ("sysfs/cpu: Add vulnerability folder")
added a generic folder and set of files for reporting information on
CPU vulnerabilities. One of those was for meltdown:

  /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/meltdown

This commit wires up that file for 64-bit Book3S powerpc.

For now we default to "Vulnerable" unless the RFI flush is enabled.
That may not actually be true on all hardware, further patches will
refine the reporting based on the CPU/platform etc. But for now we
default to being pessimists.
