dt-bindings: gpio: uniphier: add UniPhier GPIO binding

This GPIO controller is used on UniPhier SoC family.

The vendor specific property "socionext,interrupt-ranges" is for
specifying interrupt mapping to the parent interrupt controller
because the mapping is not contiguous.  It works like "ranges",
but transforms "interrupts" instead of "reg".
