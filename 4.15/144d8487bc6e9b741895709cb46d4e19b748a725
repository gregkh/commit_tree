sched/fair: Implement synchonous PELT detach on load-balance migrate

Vincent wondered why his self migrating task had a roughly 50% dip in
load_avg when landing on the new CPU. This is because we uncondionally
take the asynchronous detatch_entity route, which can lead to the
attach on the new CPU still seeing the old CPU's contribution to
tg->load_avg, effectively halving the new CPU's shares.

While in general this is something we have to live with, there is the
special case of runnable migration where we can do better.
