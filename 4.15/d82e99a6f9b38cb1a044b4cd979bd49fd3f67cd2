ARM: sa1100: simpad: Correct I2C GPIO offsets

Arnd reported the following build bug bug:

In file included from arch/arm/mach-sa1100/simpad.c:20:0:
arch/arm/mach-sa1100/include/mach/SA-1100.h:1118:18: error: large

This is what happened:

commit b2e63555592f81331c8da3afaa607d8cf83e8138
"i2c: gpio: Convert to use descriptors"
commit 4d0ce62c0a02e41a65cfdcfe277f5be430edc371
"i2c: gpio: Augment all boardfiles to use open drain"
together uncovered an old bug in the Simpad board
file: as theGPIO_LOOKUP_IDX() encodes GPIO offsets
on gpiochips in an u16 (see <linux/gpio/machine.h>)
these GPIO "numbers" does not fit, since in
arch/arm/mach-sa1100/include/mach/SA-1100.h it is
defined as:

  #define GPIO_GPIO(Nb) (0x00000001 << (Nb))
  (...)
  #define GPIO_GPIO21 GPIO_GPIO(21) /* GPIO [21] */

This is however provably wrong, since the i2c-gpio
driver uses proper GPIO numbers, albeit earlier from
the global number space, whereas this GPIO_GPIO21
is the local line offset in the GPIO register, which
is used in other code but certainly not in the
gpiolib GPIO driver in drivers/gpio/gpio-sa1100.c, which
has code like this:

static void sa1100_gpio_set(struct gpio_chip *chip,
                            unsigned offset, int value)
{
    int reg = value ? R_GPSR : R_GPCR;

    writel_relaxed(BIT(offset),
        sa1100_gpio_chip(chip)->membase + reg);
}

So far everything however compiled fine as an unsigned
int was used to pass the GPIO numbers in
struct i2c_gpio_platform_data. We can trace the actual error
back to

commit dbd406f9d0a1d33a1303eb75cbe3f9435513d339
"ARM: 7025/1: simpad: add GPIO based device definitions."
This added the i2c_gpio with the wrong offsets.

This commit was before the SA1100 was converted to use
the gpiolib, but as can be seen from the contemporary
gpio.c in mach-sa1100, it was already using:

static int sa1100_gpio_get(struct gpio_chip *chip,
                           unsigned offset)
{
        return GPLR & GPIO_GPIO(offset);
}

And GPIO_GPIO() is essentially the BIT() macro.
