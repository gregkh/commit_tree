net: hns3: fix a bug when getting phy address from NCL_config file

Driver gets phy address from NCL_config file and uses the phy address
to initialize phydev. There are 5 bits for phy address. And C22 phy
address has 5 bits. So 0-31 are all valid address for phy. If there
is no phy, it will crash. Because driver always get a valid phy address.

This patch fixes the phy address to 8 bits, and use 0xff to indicate
invalid phy address.
