mm: implement find_get_pages_range_tag()

Patch series "Ranged pagevec tagged lookup", v3.

In this series I provide a ranged variant of pagevec_lookup_tag() and
use it in places where it makes sense.  This series removes some common
code and it also has a potential for speeding up some operations
similarly as for pagevec_lookup_range() (but for now I can think of only
artificial cases where this happens).

This patch (of 16):

Implement a variant of find_get_pages_tag() that stops iterating at
given index.  Lots of users of this function (through pagevec_lookup())
actually want a range lookup and all of them are currently open-coding
this.

Also create corresponding pagevec_lookup_range_tag() function.
