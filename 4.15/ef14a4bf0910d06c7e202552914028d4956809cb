HID: rmi: Check that a device is a RMI device before calling RMI functions

The hid-rmi driver may handle non rmi devices on composite USB devices.
Callbacks need to make sure that the current device is a RMI device before
calling RMI specific functions. Most callbacks already have this check, but
this patch adds checks to the remaining callbacks.
