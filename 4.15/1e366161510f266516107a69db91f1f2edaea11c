net: aquantia: Fix hardware DMA stream overload on large MRRS

Systems with large MRRS on device (2K, 4K) with high data rates and/or
large MTU, atlantic observes DMA packet buffer overflow. On some systems
that causes PCIe transaction errors, hardware NMIs or datapath freeze.
This patch
1) Limits MRRS from device side to 2K (thats maximum our hardware supports)
2) Limit maximum size of outstanding TX DMA data read requests. This makes
hardware buffers running fine.
