ata: ceva: Correct the AXI bus configuration for SATA ports

Previously PAXIC register was programmed before configuring PCFG
register. PCFG should be programmed with the address of the port
for which PAXIC should be configured for.
This was not happening before, so only one port PAXIC was written
correctly and the other port was having wrong value.
This patch moves the PXAIC register write after configuring PCFG,
doing so will correct the axi bus settings for sata port0 & port1.
