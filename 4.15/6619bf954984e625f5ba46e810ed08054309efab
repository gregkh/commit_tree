NTB: switchtec_ntb: Implement doorbell registers

Pretty straightforward implementation of doorbell registers.
The shift and mask were setup in an earlier patch and this just hooks
up the appropriate portion of the IDB register as the local doorbells
and the opposite portion of ODB as the peer doorbells. The DB mask is
protected by a spinlock to avoid concurrent read-modify-write accesses.
