ext4: add support for online resizing with bigalloc

This patch adds support for online resizing on bigalloc file system by
implementing EXT4_IOC_RESIZE_FS ioctl. Old resize interfaces (add
block groups and extend last block group) are left untouched. Tests
performed with cluster sizes of 1, 2, 4 and 8 blocks (of size 4k) per
cluster. I will add these tests to xfstests.
