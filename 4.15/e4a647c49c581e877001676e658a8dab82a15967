crypto: talitos - zeroize the descriptor with memset()

This patch zeroize the descriptor at allocation using memset().
This has two advantages:
- It reduces the number of places where data has to be set to 0
- It avoids reading memory and loading the cache with data that
will be entirely replaced.
