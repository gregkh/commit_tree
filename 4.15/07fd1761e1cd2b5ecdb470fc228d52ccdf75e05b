powerpc/tm: Add commandline option to disable hardware transactional memory

Currently the kernel relies on firmware to inform it whether or not the
CPU supports HTM and as long as the kernel was built with
CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=y then it will allow userspace to make
use of the facility.

There may be situations where it would be advantageous for the kernel
to not allow userspace to use HTM, currently the only way to achieve
this is to recompile the kernel with CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n.

This patch adds a simple commandline option so that HTM can be
disabled at boot time.

 Always disable, regardless of initial state, to avoid user confusion.]
