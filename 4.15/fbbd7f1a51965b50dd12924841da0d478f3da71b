s390: always save and restore all registers on context switch

The switch_to() macro has an optimization to avoid saving and
restoring register contents that aren't needed for kernel threads.

There is however the possibility that a kernel thread execve's a user
space program. In such a case the execve'd process can partially see
the contents of the previous process, which shouldn't be allowed.

To avoid this, simply always save and restore register contents on
context switch.
