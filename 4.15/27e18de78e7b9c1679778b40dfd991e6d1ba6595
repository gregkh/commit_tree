drm/sun4i: tcon: Support backend input mux

The TCON has a mux to select the source of the data to display.
This mux includes selecting the display backends. On the A31,
which has two display pipelines, this mux can let the TCON
select either backend as its data source. Although the muxing
can be changed on the fly, DRM needs to be able to group a
bunch of layers such that they get switched to another crtc
together. This is because the display backend does the layer
compositing, while the TCON generates the display timings.
This constraint is not supported by DRM.

Here we simply pair up backends and TCONs with the same ID.
