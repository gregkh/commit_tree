RDMA/netlink: Fix locking around __ib_get_device_by_index

Holding locks is mandatory when calling __ib_device_get_by_index,
otherwise there are races during the list iteration with device removal.

Since the locks are static to device.c, __ib_device_get_by_index can
never be called correctly by any user out side the file.

Make the function static and provide a safe function that gets the
correct locks and returns a kref'd pointer. Fix all callers.
