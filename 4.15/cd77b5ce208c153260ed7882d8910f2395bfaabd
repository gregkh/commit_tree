powerpc/powernv/cpufreq: Fix the frequency read by /proc/cpuinfo

The call to /proc/cpuinfo in turn calls cpufreq_quick_get() which
returns the last frequency requested by the kernel, but may not
reflect the actual frequency the processor is running at. This patch
makes a call to cpufreq_get() instead which returns the current
frequency reported by the hardware.
