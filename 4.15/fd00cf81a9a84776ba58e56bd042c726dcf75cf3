serdev: fix receive_buf return value when no callback

The receive_buf callback is supposed to return the number of bytes
processed and should specifically not return a negative errno.

Due to missing sanity checks in the serdev tty-port controller, a driver
not providing a receive_buf callback could cause the flush_to_ldisc()
worker to spin in a tight loop when the tty buffer pointers are
incremented with -EINVAL (-22).

The missing sanity checks have now been added to the tty-port
controller, but let's fix up the serdev-controller helper as well.
