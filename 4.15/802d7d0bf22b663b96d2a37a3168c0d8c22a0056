staging: wlan-ng: Avoid bogus endianness

The linkstatus variable in the info struct received as __le16
but handled in every other place in the driver as u16

Fix that and remove the sparse warning that occurred due to it:
prism2sta.c:1450:29: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
prism2sta.c:1450:29:    expected unsigned short [unsigned] [usertype] link_status_new
prism2sta.c:1450:29:    got restricted __le16 [usertype] linkstatus
