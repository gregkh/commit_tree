powerpc/lib: Implement UACCESS_FLUSHCACHE API

Implement the architecture specific portitions of the UACCESS_FLUSHCACHE
API. This provides functions for the copy_user_flushcache iterator that
ensure that when the copy is finished the destination buffer contains
a copy of the original and that the destination buffer is clean in the
processor caches.
