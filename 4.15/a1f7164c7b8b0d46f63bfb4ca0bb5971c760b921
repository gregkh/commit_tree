sched: Misc preps for cgroup unified hierarchy interface

Make the following changes in preparation for the cpu controller
interface implementation for cgroup2.  This patch doesn't cause any
functional differences.

* s/cpu_stats_show()/cpu_cfs_stat_show()/

* s/cpu_files/cpu_legacy_files/

v2: Dropped cpuacct changes as it won't be used by cpu controller
    interface anymore.
