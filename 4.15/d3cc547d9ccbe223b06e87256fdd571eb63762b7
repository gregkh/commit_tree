esp6: remove redundant initialization of esph

The pointer esph is being initialized with a value that is never
read and then being updated.  Remove the redundant initialization
and move the declaration and initializtion of esph to the local
code block.

Cleans up clang warning:
net/ipv6/esp6.c:562:21: warning: Value stored to 'esph' during its
initialization is never read
