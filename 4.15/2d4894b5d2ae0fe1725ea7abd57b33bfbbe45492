mm: remove cold parameter from free_hot_cold_page*

Most callers users of free_hot_cold_page claim the pages being released
are cache hot.  The exception is the page reclaim paths where it is
likely that enough pages will be freed in the near future that the
per-cpu lists are going to be recycled and the cache hotness information
is lost.  As no one really cares about the hotness of pages being
released to the allocator, just ditch the parameter.

The APIs are renamed to indicate that it's no longer about hot/cold
pages.  It should also be less confusing as there are subtle differences
between them.  __free_pages drops a reference and frees a page when the
refcount reaches zero.  free_hot_cold_page handled pages whose refcount
was already zero which is non-obvious from the name.  free_unref_page
should be more obvious.

No performance impact is expected as the overhead is marginal.  The
parameter is removed simply because it is a bit stupid to have a useless
parameter copied everywhere.
