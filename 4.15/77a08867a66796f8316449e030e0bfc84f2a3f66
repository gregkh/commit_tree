svcrdma: Enqueue after setting XPT_CLOSE in completion handlers

I noticed the server was sometimes not closing the connection after
a flushed Send. For example, if the client responds with an RNR NAK
to a Reply from the server, that client might be deadlocked, and
thus wouldn't send any more traffic. Thus the server wouldn't have
any opportunity to notice the XPT_CLOSE bit has been set.

Enqueue the transport so that svcxprt notices the bit even if there
is no more transport activity after a flushed completion, QP access
error, or device removal event.
