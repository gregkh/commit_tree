media: v4l2-fwnode: use the cached value instead of getting again

There is a get/put operation in order to get firmware is_available
data there at the __v4l2_async_notifier_parse_fwnode_endpoints()
function. However, instead of using it, the code just reads again
without the lock. That's a bug, as dev_fwnode isn't guaranteed
to be there once fwnode_handle_put() has been called on it.

This solves this smatch warning:

drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-fwnode.c:453:8: warning: variable 'is_available' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
   bool is_available;
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~
