KVM: X86: #GP when guest attempts to write MCi_STATUS register w/o 0

Both Intel SDM and AMD APM mentioned that MCi_STATUS, when the register is
implemented, this register can be cleared by explicitly writing 0s to this
register. Writing 1s to this register will cause a general-protection
exception.

The mce is emulated in qemu, so just the guest attempts to write 1 to this
register should cause a #GP, this patch does it.
