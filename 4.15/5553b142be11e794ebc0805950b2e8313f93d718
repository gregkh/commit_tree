arm: KVM: Fix VTTBR_BADDR_MASK BUG_ON off-by-one

VTTBR_BADDR_MASK is used to sanity check the size and alignment of the
VTTBR address. It seems to currently be off by one, thereby only
allowing up to 39-bit addresses (instead of 40-bit) and also
insufficiently checking the alignment. This patch fixes it.

This patch is the 32bit pendent of Kristina's arm64 fix, and
she deserves the actual kudos for pinpointing that one.
