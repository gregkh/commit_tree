lockd: lost rollback of set_grace_period() in lockd_down_net()

Commit efda760fe95ea ("lockd: fix lockd shutdown race") is incorrect,
it removes lockd_manager and disarm grace_period_end for init_net only.

If nfsd was started from another net namespace lockd_up_net() calls
set_grace_period() that adds lockd_manager into per-netns list
and queues grace_period_end delayed work.

These action should be reverted in lockd_down_net().
Otherwise it can lead to double list_add on after restart nfsd in netns,
and to use-after-free if non-disarmed delayed work will be executed after netns destroy.
