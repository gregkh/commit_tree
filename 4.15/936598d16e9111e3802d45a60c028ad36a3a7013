drm/sun4i: backend: Add comment explaining why registers are cleared

Many of the backend's layer configuration registers have undefined
default values. This poses a risk as we use regmap_update_bits in
some places, and don't overwrite the whole register.

At probe/bind time we explicitly clear all the control registers
by writing 0 to them. This patch adds a more detailed explanation
on why we're doing this.
