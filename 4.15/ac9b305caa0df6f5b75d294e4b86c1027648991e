KVM: nVMX/nSVM: Don't intercept #UD when running L2

When running L2, #UD should be intercepted by L1 or just forwarded
directly to L2. It should not reach L0 x86 emulator.
Therefore, set intercept for #UD only based on L1 exception-bitmap.

Also add WARN_ON_ONCE() on L0 #UD intercept handlers to make sure
it is never reached while running L2.

This improves commit ae1f57670703 ("KVM: nVMX: Do not emulate #UD while
in guest mode") by removing an unnecessary exit from L2 to L0 on #UD
when L1 doesn't intercept it.

In addition, SVM L0 #UD intercept handler doesn't handle correctly the
case it is raised from L2. In this case, it should forward the #UD to
guest instead of x86 emulator. As done in VMX #UD intercept handler.
This commit fixes this issue as-well.
