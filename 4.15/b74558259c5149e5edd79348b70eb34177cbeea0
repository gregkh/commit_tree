The syzkaller testcase will execute VMXON/VMLAUCH instructions, so the
vmx->nested stuff is populated, it will also issue KVM_SMI ioctl. However,
the testcase is just a simple c program and not be lauched by something
like seabios which implements smi_handler. Commit 05cade71cf (KVM: nSVM:
fix SMI injection in guest mode) gets out of guest mode and set nested.vmxon
to false for the duration of SMM according to SDM 34.14.1 "leave VMX
operation" upon entering SMM. We can't alloc/free the vmx->nested stuff
each time when entering/exiting SMM since it will induce more overhead. So
the function vmx_pre_enter_smm() marks nested.vmxon false even if vmx->nested
stuff is still populated. What it expected is em_rsm() can mark nested.vmxon
to be true again. However, the smi_handler/rsm will not execute since there
is no something like seabios in this scenario. The function free_nested()
fails to free the vmx->nested stuff since the vmx->nested.vmxon is false
which results in the above warning.

This patch fixes it by also considering the no SMI handler case, luckily
vmx->nested.smm.vmxon is marked according to the value of vmx->nested.vmxon
in vmx_pre_enter_smm(), we can take advantage of it and free vmx->nested
stuff when L1 goes down.
