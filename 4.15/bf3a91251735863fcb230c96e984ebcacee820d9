powerpc/kprobes: Clean up jprobe detection in livepatch handler

In commit c05b8c4474c03 ("powerpc/kprobes: Skip livepatch_handler() for
jprobes"), we added a helper is_current_kprobe_addr() to help detect if
the modified regs->nip was due to a jprobe or livepatch. Masami felt
that the function name was not quite clear. To that end, this patch
renames is_current_kprobe_addr() to __is_active_jprobe() and adds a
comment to (hopefully) better clarify the purpose of this helper. The
helper has also now been moved to kprobes-ftrace.c so that it is only
available for KPROBES_ON_FTRACE.
