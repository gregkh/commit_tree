EDAC, ghes: Model a single, logical memory controller

We're enumerating the DIMMs through a DMI walk and since we can't get
any more detailed topological information about which DIMMs belong to
which memory controller, convert it to a single, logical controller
which contains all the DIMMs.

The error reporting path from GHES ghes_edac_report_mem_error() doesn't
get called in NMI context but add a warning about it to catch any
changes in the future as if so, our locking scheme will be insufficient
then.
