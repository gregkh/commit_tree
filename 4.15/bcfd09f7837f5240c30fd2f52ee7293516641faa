xfrm: Return error on unknown encap_type in init_state

Currently esp will happily create an xfrm state with an unknown
encap type for IPv4, without setting the necessary state parameters.
This patch fixes it by returning -EINVAL.

There is a similar problem in IPv6 where if the mode is unknown
we will skip initialisation while returning zero.  However, this
is harmless as the mode has already been checked further up the
stack.  This patch removes this anomaly by aligning the IPv6
behaviour with IPv4 and treating unknown modes (which cannot
actually happen) as transport mode.
