Btrfs: add write_flags for compression bio

Compression code path has only flaged bios with REQ_OP_WRITE no matter
where the bios come from, but it could be a sync write if fsync starts
this writeback or a normal writeback write if wb kthread starts a
periodic writeback.

It breaks the rule that sync writes and writeback writes need to be
differentiated from each other, because from the POV of block layer,
all bios need to be recognized by these flags in order to do some
management, e.g. throttlling.

This passes writeback_control to compression write path so that it can
send bios with proper flags to block layer.
