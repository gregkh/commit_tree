drm/vmwgfx: fix memory corruption with legacy/sou connectors

It looks like in all cases 'struct vmw_connector_state' is used.  But
only in stdu connectors, was atomic_{duplicate,destroy}_state() properly
subclassed.  Leading to writes beyond the end of the allocated connector
state block and all sorts of fun memory corruption related crashes.
