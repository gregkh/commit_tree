NTB: switchtec_ntb: Initialize hardware for doorbells and messages

Set up some hardware registers and creates interrupt service routines
for the doorbells and messages.

There are 64 doorbells in the switch that are shared between all
partitions. The upper 4 doorbells are also shared with the messages
and are therefore not used. Thus, this provides 28 doorbells for each
partition.
