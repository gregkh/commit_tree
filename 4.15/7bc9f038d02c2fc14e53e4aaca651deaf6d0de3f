media: i2c: OV5647: ensure clock lane in LP-11 state before streaming on

When I was supporting Rpi Camera Module on the ASUS Tinker board,
I found this driver have some issues with rockchip's mipi-csi driver.
It didn't place clock lane in LP-11 state before performing
D-PHY initialisation.

>From our experience, on some OV sensors,
LP-11 state is not achieved while BIT(5)-0x4800 is cleared.

So let's set BIT(5) and BIT(0) both while not streaming, in order to
coax the clock lane into LP-11 state.

0x4800 : MIPI CTRL 00
	BIT(5) : clock lane gate enable
		0: continuous
		1: none-continuous
	BIT(0) : manually set clock lane
		0: Not used
		1: used
