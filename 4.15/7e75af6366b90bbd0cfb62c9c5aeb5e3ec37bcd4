mlxsw: spectrum: Propagate extack for tunnel events

The function mlxsw_sp_rif_create() takes an extack parameter. So far,
for creation of loopback interfaces, NULL was passed. For some events
however the extack can be extracted and passed along. So do that for
NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER handler.

Use the opportunity to update the type of info argument that
mlxsw_sp_netdevice_ipip_ol_event() takes. Follow-up patches will
introduce handling of more changes, and some of them carry an extack as
well, but in an info structure of a different type. Though not strictly
erroneous (the pointer could be cast whichever way), it makes no sense
to pretend the value is always of a certain type, when in fact it isn't.
So change the prototype of the above-mentioned function as well.
