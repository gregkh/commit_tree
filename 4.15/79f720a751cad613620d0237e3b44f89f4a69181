blk-mq: only run the hardware queue if IO is pending

Currently we are inconsistent in when we decide to run the queue. Using
blk_mq_run_hw_queues() we check if the hctx has pending IO before
running it, but we don't do that from the individual queue run function,
blk_mq_run_hw_queue(). This results in a lot of extra and pointless
queue runs, potentially, on flush requests and (much worse) on tag
starvation situations. This is observable just looking at top output,
with lots of kworkers active. For the !async runs, it just adds to the
CPU overhead of blk-mq.

Move the has-pending check into the run function instead of having
callers do it.
