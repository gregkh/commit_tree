drm/amdkfd: Reuse CHIP_* from amdgpu v2

There are already CHIP_* definitions under amd_shared.h file on amdgpu
side, so KFD should reuse them rather than defining new ones.

Using enum for asic type requires default cases on switch statements
to prevent compiler warnings. WARN on unsupported ASICs. It should never
get there because KFD should not be initialized on unsupported devices.

v2: Replace BUG() with WARN and error return
