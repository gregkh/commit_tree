drm/amd/display: Fix context alloc failed logging

Since there was no return statement in the fail block immediately
preceding the context_alloc_fail block, any failure within the
function caused a context alloc failed error message to be printed.
Since the context_alloc_fail block is only used once, move it to
where the goto is directly and accompany it with a return statement.
