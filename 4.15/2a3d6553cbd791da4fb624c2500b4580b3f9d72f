KVM: PPC: Tie KVM_CAP_PPC_HTM to the user-visible TM feature

Currently we use CPU_FTR_TM to decide if the CPU/kernel can support
TM (Transactional Memory), and if it's true we advertise that to
Qemu (or similar) via KVM_CAP_PPC_HTM.

PPC_FEATURE2_HTM is the user-visible feature bit, which indicates that
the CPU and kernel can support TM. Currently CPU_FTR_TM and
PPC_FEATURE2_HTM always have the same value, either true or false, so
using the former for KVM_CAP_PPC_HTM is correct.

However some Power9 CPUs can operate in a mode where TM is enabled but
TM suspended state is disabled. In this mode CPU_FTR_TM is true, but
PPC_FEATURE2_HTM is false. Instead a different PPC_FEATURE2 bit is
set, to indicate that this different mode of TM is available.

It is not safe to let guests use TM as-is, when the CPU is in this
mode. So to prevent that from happening, use PPC_FEATURE2_HTM to
determine the value of KVM_CAP_PPC_HTM.
