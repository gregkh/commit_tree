ext4: prevent data corruption with inline data + DAX

If an inode has inline data it is currently prevented from using DAX by a
check in ext4_set_inode_flags().  When the inode grows inline data via
ext4_create_inline_data() or removes its inline data via
ext4_destroy_inline_data_nolock(), the value of S_DAX can change.

Currently these changes are unsafe because we don't hold off page faults
and I/O, write back dirty radix tree entries and invalidate all mappings.
There are also issues with mm-level races when changing the value of S_DAX,
as well as issues with the VM_MIXEDMAP flag:

The unsafe transition of S_DAX can reliably cause data corruption, as shown
by the following fstest:

Fix this issue by preventing the DAX mount option from being used on
filesystems that were created to support inline data.  Inline data is an
option given to mkfs.ext4.
