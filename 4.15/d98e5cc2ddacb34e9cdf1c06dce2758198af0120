drm/amd/display: clean up and simply locking logic

always take update lock instead of using HW built in update
lock trigger with write to primary_addr_lo.

we will be a little more inefficient with the extra registers
write to lock, but this simplify code and make it always correct.

Will revisit locking optimization once update sequence mature
