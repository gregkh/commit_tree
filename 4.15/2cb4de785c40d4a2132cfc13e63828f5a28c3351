thermal/drivers/hisi: Fix kernel panic on alarm interrupt

The threaded interrupt for the alarm interrupt is requested before the
temperature controller is setup. This one can fire an interrupt immediately
leading to a kernel panic as the sensor data is not initialized.

In order to prevent that, move the threaded irq after the Tsensor is setup.
