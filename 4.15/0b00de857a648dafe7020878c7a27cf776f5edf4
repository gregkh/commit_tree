x86/cpuid: Add generic table for CPUID dependencies

Some CPUID features depend on other features. Currently it's
possible to to clear dependent features, but not clear the base features,
which can cause various interesting problems.

This patch implements a generic table to describe dependencies
between CPUID features, to be used by all code that clears
CPUID.

Some subsystems (like XSAVE) had an own implementation of this,
but it's better to do it all in a single place for everyone.

Then clear_cpu_cap and setup_clear_cpu_cap always look up
this table and clear all dependencies too.

This is intended to be a practical table: only for features
that make sense to clear. If someone for example clears FPU,
or other features that are essentially part of the required
base feature set, not much is going to work. Handling
that is right now out of scope. We're only handling
features which can be usefully cleared.
