Staging: rtl8723bs: core: rtw_cmd: Remove cast to pointer types in kfree

The cast to pointer types in kfree is not needed and can be dropped.
This was done using the following semantic patch by coccinelle,
except kfree((unsigned char*) pcmd->parmbuf) which was transformed by
hand because coccinelle didn't have enough type information.

type T,P;
T* x;

kfree(
-(P *)
