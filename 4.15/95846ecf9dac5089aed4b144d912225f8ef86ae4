pid: replace pid bitmap implementation with IDR API

Patch series "Replacing PID bitmap implementation with IDR API", v4.

This series replaces kernel bitmap implementation of PID allocation with
IDR API.  These patches are written to simplify the kernel by replacing
custom code with calls to generic code.

The following are the stats for pid and pid_namespace object files
before and after the replacement.  There is a noteworthy change between
the IDR and bitmap implementation.

Before
   text       data        bss        dec        hex    filename

The following are the stats for ps, pstree and calling readdir on /proc
for 10,000 processes.

ps:
        With IDR API    With bitmap
real    0m1.479s        0m2.319s
user    0m0.070s        0m0.060s
sys     0m0.289s        0m0.516s

pstree:
        With IDR API    With bitmap
real    0m1.024s        0m1.794s
user    0m0.348s        0m0.612s
sys     0m0.184s        0m0.264s

proc:
        With IDR API    With bitmap
real    0m0.059s        0m0.074s
user    0m0.000s        0m0.004s
sys     0m0.016s        0m0.016s

This patch (of 2):

Replace the current bitmap implementation for Process ID allocation.
Functions that are no longer required, for example, free_pidmap(),
alloc_pidmap(), etc.  are removed.  The rest of the functions are
modified to use the IDR API.  The change was made to make the PID
allocation less complex by replacing custom code with calls to generic
API.
