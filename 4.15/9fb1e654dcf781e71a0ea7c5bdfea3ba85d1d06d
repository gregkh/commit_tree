thunderbolt: Add support for frame mode

When high-speed DMA paths are used to transfer arbitrary data over a
Thunderbolt link, DMA rings should be in frame mode instead of raw mode.
The latter is used by the control channel (ring 0). In frame mode each
data frame can hold up to 4kB payload.

This patch modifies the DMA ring code to allow configuring a ring to be
in frame mode by passing a new flag (RING_FLAG_FRAME) to the ring when
it is allocated. In addition there might be need to enable end-to-end
(E2E) workaround for the ring to prevent losing Rx frames in certain
situations. We add another flag (RING_FLAG_E2E) that can be used for
this purpose.

This code is based on the work done by Amir Levy and Michael Jamet.
