ARM: smp_scu: add a helper for powering on a specific CPU

To boot the secondary CPUs on the Amlogic Meson8/Meson8m2 (Cortex-A9)
and Meson8b (Cortex-A5) SoCs we have to enable SCU mode SCU_PM_NORMAL,
otherwise the secondary cores will not start.
This patch adds a scu_cpu_power_enable() function which can be used to
enable SCU_PM_NORMAL for a specific (logical) CPU. An internal helper
function is also created, to avoid code duplication with
scu_power_mode().
