net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Defer port enabling to calling port_enable

There is no need to configure the enabled ports once in bcm_sf2_sw_setup() and
then a second time around when dsa_switch_ops::port_enable is called, just do
it when port_enable is called which is better in terms of power consumption and
correctness.
