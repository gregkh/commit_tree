RISC-V: Make __NR_riscv_flush_icache visible to userspace

We were hoping to avoid making this visible to userspace, but it looks
like we're going to have to because QEMU's user-mode emulation doesn't
want to emulate a vDSO.  Having vDSO-only system calls was a bit
unothodox anyway, so I think in this case it's OK to just make the
actual system call number public.

This patch simply moves the definition of __NR_riscv_flush_icache
availiable to userspace, which results in the deletion of the now empty
vdso-syscalls.h.

Changes since v1:

* I've moved the definition into uapi/asm/syscalls.h rathen than
  uapi/asm/unistd.h.  This allows me to keep asm/unistd.h, so we can
  keep the syscall table macros sane.
* As a side effect of the above, this no longer disables all system
  calls on RISC-V.  Whoops!
