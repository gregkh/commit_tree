arm64: entry.S: Remove disable_dbg

enable_step_tsk is the only user of disable_dbg, which doesn't respect
our 'dai' order for exception masking. enable_step_tsk may enable
single-step, so previously needed to mask debug exceptions to prevent us
from single-stepping kernel_exit. enable_step_tsk is called at the end
of the ret_to_user loop, which has already masked all exceptions so this
is no longer needed.

Remove disable_dbg, add a comment that enable_step_tsk's caller should
have masked debug.
