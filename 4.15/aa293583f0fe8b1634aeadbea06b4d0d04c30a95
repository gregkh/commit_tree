configfs: make ci_type field, some pointers and function arguments const

The ci_type field of the config_item structure do not modify the fields
of the config_item_type structure it points to. And the other pointers
initialized with ci_type do not modify the fields as well.
So, make the ci_type field and the pointers initialized with ci_type
as const.

Make the struct config_item_type *type function argument of functions
config_{item/group}_init_type_name const as the argument in both the
functions is only stored in the ci_type field of a config_item structure
which is now made const.
Make the argument of configfs_register_default_group const as it is
only passed to the argument of the function config_group_init_type_name
which is now const.
