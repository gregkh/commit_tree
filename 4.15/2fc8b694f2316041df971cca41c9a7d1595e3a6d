media: atomisp: fix small Kconfig issues

The help text should be indented by at least two spaces after the
'help' separator. This is both good practice and the media_build system
for building media drivers makes this assumption.

Fix this for the atomisp/i2c/Kconfig and fix the atomisp/pci/Kconfig
that didn't align the help separator with the preceding keywords.
