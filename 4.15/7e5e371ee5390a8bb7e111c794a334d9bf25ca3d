MIPS: Fix CPS SMP NS16550 UART defaults

The MIPS_CPS_NS16550_BASE and MIPS_CPS_NS16550_SHIFT options have no
defaults for non-Malta platforms which select SYS_SUPPORTS_MIPS_CPS
(i.e. the pistachio and generic platforms). This is problematic for
automated allyesconfig and allmodconfig builds based on these platforms,
since make silentoldconfig tries to ask the user for values, and
especially since v4.15 where the default platform was switched to
generic.

Default these options to 0 and arrange for MIPS_CPS_NS16550 to be no
when using that default base address, so that the option only has an
effect when the default is provided (i.e. Malta) or when a value is
provided by the user.
