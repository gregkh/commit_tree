NFS: Don't compare apples to elephants to determine access bits

The NFS_ACCESS_* flags aren't a 1:1 mapping to the MAY_* flags, so
checking for MAY_WHATEVER might have surprising results in
nfs*_proc_access().  Let's simplify this check when determining which
bits to ask for, and do it in a generic place instead of copying code
for each NFS version.
