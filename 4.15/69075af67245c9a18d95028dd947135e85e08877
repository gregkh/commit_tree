MAINTAINERS: Fix Dialog search term for watchdog binding file

Commit 340267640d769d3b3af9 ("MAINTAINERS: da9062/61 updates to the Dialog
Semiconductor search terms") contained a typo for the watchdog binding:
da92??-wdt.txt should have read da90??-wdt.txt. This new commit will fix
the error and allows Dialog Semiconductor to follow files for PMIC
bindings correctly.
