bnxt_en: Fix an error handling path in 'bnxt_get_module_eeprom()'

Error code returned by 'bnxt_read_sfp_module_eeprom_info()' is handled a
few lines above when reading the A0 portion of the EEPROM.
The same should be done when reading the A2 portion of the EEPROM.

In order to correctly propagate an error, update 'rc' in this 2nd call as
well, otherwise 0 (success) is returned.
