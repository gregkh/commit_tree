powerpc/lib/sstep: Fix fixed-point arithmetic instructions that set CA32

There are existing fixed-point arithmetic instructions that always set the
CA bit of XER to reflect the carry out of bit 0 in 64-bit mode and out of
bit 32 in 32-bit mode. In ISA v3.0, these instructions also always set the
CA32 bit of XER to reflect the carry out of bit 32.

This fixes the emulated behaviour of such instructions when running on a
system that is compliant with POWER ISA v3.0. The following instructions
are affected:
  * Add Immediate Carrying (addic)
  * Add Immediate Carrying and Record (addic.)
  * Subtract From Immediate Carrying (subfic)
  * Add Carrying (addc[.])
  * Subtract From Carrying (subfc[.])
  * Add Extended (adde[.])
  * Subtract From Extended (subfe[.])
  * Add to Minus One Extended (addme[.])
  * Subtract From Minus One Extended (subfme[.])
  * Add to Zero Extended (addze[.])
  * Subtract From Zero Extended (subfze[.])
