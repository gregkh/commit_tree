bpf: Add name, load_time, uid and map_ids to bpf_prog_info

The patch adds name and load_time to struct bpf_prog_aux.  They
are also exported to bpf_prog_info.

The bpf_prog's name is passed by userspace during BPF_PROG_LOAD.
The kernel only stores the first (BPF_PROG_NAME_LEN - 1) bytes
and the name stored in the kernel is always \0 terminated.

The kernel will reject name that contains characters other than
isalnum() and '_'.  It will also reject name that is not null
terminated.

The existing 'user->uid' of the bpf_prog_aux is also exported to
the bpf_prog_info as created_by_uid.

The existing 'used_maps' of the bpf_prog_aux is exported to
the newly added members 'nr_map_ids' and 'map_ids' of
the bpf_prog_info.  On the input, nr_map_ids tells how
big the userspace's map_ids buffer is.  On the output,
nr_map_ids tells the exact user_map_cnt and it will only
copy up to the userspace's map_ids buffer is allowed.
