dmaengine: bcm-sba-raid: Use only single mailbox channel

Each mailbox channel used by Broadcom SBA RAID driver is
a separate HW ring.

Currently, Broadcom SBA RAID driver creates one DMA channel
using one or more mailbox channels. When we are using more
than one mailbox channels for a DMA channel, the sba_request
are distributed evenly among multiple mailbox channels which
results in sba_request being completed out-of-order.

The above described out-of-order completion of sba_request
breaks the dma_async_is_complete() API because it assumes
DMA cookies are completed in orderly fashion.

To ensure correct behaviour of dma_async_is_complete() API,
this patch updates Broadcom SBA RAID driver to use only
single mailbox channel. If additional mailbox channels are
specified in DT then those will be ignored.
