ARM: 8713/1: NOMMU: Support MPU in XIP configuration

Currently, there is assumption in early MPU setup code that kernel
image is located in RAM, which is obviously not true for XIP. To run
code from ROM we need to make sure that it is covered by MPU. However,
due to we allocate regions (semi-)dynamically we can run into issue of
trimming region we are running from in case ROM spawns several MPU
regions. To help deal with that we enforce minimum alignments for start
end end of XIP address space as 1MB and 128Kb correspondingly.
