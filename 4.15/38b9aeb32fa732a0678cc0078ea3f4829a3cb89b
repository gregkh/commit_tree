arm64: Port deprecated instruction emulation to new sysctl interface

Currently, armv8_deprected.c takes charge of the "abi" sysctl
directory, which makes life difficult for other code that wants to
register sysctls in the same directory.

There is a "new" [1] sysctl registration interface that removes the
need to define ctl_tables for parent directories explicitly, which
is ideal here.

This patch ports register_insn_emulation_sysctl() over to the
register_sysctl() interface and removes the redundant ctl_table for
"abi".

[1] fea478d4101a (sysctl: Add register_sysctl for normal sysctl
users)
The commit message notes an intent to port users of the
pre-existing interfaces over to register_sysctl(), though the
number of users of the new interface currently appears negligible.
