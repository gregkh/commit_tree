Unify migrate_pages and move_pages access checks

Commit 197e7e521384 ("Sanitize 'move_pages()' permission checks") fixed
a security issue I reported in the move_pages syscall, and made it so
that you can't act on set-uid processes unless you have the
CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability.

Unify the access check logic of migrate_pages to match the new behavior
of move_pages.  We discussed this a bit in the security@ list and
thought it'd be good for consistency even though there's no evident
security impact.  The NUMA node access checks are left intact and
require CAP_SYS_NICE as before.
