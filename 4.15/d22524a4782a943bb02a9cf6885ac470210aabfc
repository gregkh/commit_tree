nvme: switch controller refcounting to use struct device

Instead of allocating a separate struct device for the character device
handle embedd it into struct nvme_ctrl and use it for the main controller
refcounting.  This removes double refcounting and gets us an automatic
reference for the character device operations.  We keep ctrl->device as a
pointer for now to avoid chaning printks all over, but in the future we
could look into message printing helpers that take a controller structure
similar to what other subsystems do.

Note the delete_ctrl operation always already has a reference (either
through sysfs due this change, or because every open file on the
/dev/nvme-fabrics node has a refernece) when it is entered now, so we
don't need to do the unless_zero variant there.
