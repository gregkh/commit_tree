KVM: arm/arm64: register irq bypass consumer on ARM/ARM64

This patch selects IRQ_BYPASS_MANAGER and HAVE_KVM_IRQ_BYPASS
configs for ARM/ARM64.

kvm_arch_has_irq_bypass() now is implemented and returns true.
As a consequence the irq bypass consumer will be registered for
ARM/ARM64 with the forwarding callbacks:

- stop/start: halt/resume guest execution
- add/del_producer: set/unset forwarding at vgic/irqchip level

We don't have any actual support yet, so nothing gets actually
forwarded.
