arm64: dts: hi6220: add coresight dt nodes

For detailed coresight topology, Hi6220 has 8xCA53 CPUs and each CPU
has one Embedded Trace Macrocell (ETM); the CPU trace data is output
to the cluster funnel. Due system has another CPU and one MCU, all of
them transfer the trace data through trace bus (ATB) to SoC funnel;
the SoC funnel is connected to Embedded Trace FIFO (ETF) with 8KB
buffer; an non-configurable replicator is used to output trace data
for two sinks, one is Embedded Trace Route (ETR) so trace data can be
saved into DRAM, another is Trace Port Interface Unit (TPIU) for
capturing trace data by external debugger.

According to the Hi6220 coresight topology, this patch is to add
coresight dt nodes.
