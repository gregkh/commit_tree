net/mlx5e: Remove timestamp set from netdevice open flow

To avoid configuration override, timestamp set call will
be moved from the netdevice open flow to the init flow.
By this, a close-open procedure will not override the timestamp
configuration.
In addition, the change will rename mlx5e_timestamp_set function
to be mlx5e_timestamp_init.
