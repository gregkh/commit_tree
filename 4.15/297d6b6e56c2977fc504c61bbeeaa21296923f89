hv: kvp: Avoid reading past allocated blocks from KVP file

While reading in more than one block (50) of KVP records, the allocation
goes per block, but the reads used the total number of allocated records
(without resetting the pointer/stream). This causes the records buffer to
overrun when the refresh reads more than one block over the previous
capacity (e.g. reading more than 100 KVP records whereas the in-memory
database was empty before).

Fix this by reading the correct number of KVP records from file each time.
