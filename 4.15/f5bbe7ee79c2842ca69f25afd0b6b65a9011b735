ipv6: prepare rt6_mtu_change() for exception table

If we move all cached dst into the exception table under the main route,
current rt6_mtu_change() will no longer be able to access them.
This commit makes rt6_mtu_change_route() function to also go through all
cached routes in the exception table under the main route and do proper
updates on the mtu.
This is a preparation in order to move all cached routes into the
exception table.
