RDMA/hns: Get rid of page operation after dma_alloc_coherent

In general, dma_alloc_coherent() returns a CPU virtual address and
a DMA address, and we have no guarantee that the underlying memory
even has an associated struct page at all.

This patch gets rid of the page operation after dma_alloc_coherent,
and records the VA returned form dma_alloc_coherent in the struct
of hem in hns RoCE driver.
