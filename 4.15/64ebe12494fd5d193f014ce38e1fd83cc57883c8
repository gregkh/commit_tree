nfsd: fix panic in posix_unblock_lock called from nfs4_laundromat

From kernel 4.9, my two nfsv4 servers sometimes suffer from
    "panic: unable to handle kernel page request"
in posix_unblock_lock() called from nfs4_laundromat().

These panics diseappear if we revert the commit "nfsd: add a LRU list
for blocked locks".

The cause appears to be a typo in nfs4_laundromat(), which is also
present in nfs4_state_shutdown_net().
