powerpc/xmon: Check before calling xive functions

Currently xmon could call XIVE functions from OPAL even if the XIVE is
disabled or does not exist in the system, as in POWER8 machines. This
causes the following exception:

 1:mon> dx
 cpu 0x1: Vector: 700 (Program Check) at [c000000423c93450]
     pc: c00000000009cfa4: opal_xive_dump+0x50/0x68
     lr: c0000000000997b8: opal_return+0x0/0x50

This patch simply checks if XIVE is enabled before calling XIVE
functions.
