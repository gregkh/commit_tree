RISC-V: Remove unused CONFIG_HVC_RISCV_SBI code

This is code that probably should never have made it into the kernel in
the first place: it depends on a driver that hadn't been reviewed yet.
During the HVC_SBI_RISCV review process a better way of doing this was
suggested, but that means this code is defunct.  It's compile-time
disabled in 4.15 because the driver isn't in, so I think it's safe to
just remove this for now.
