soc: mediatek: pwrap: add pwrap_write32 for writing in 32-bit mode

Some regulators such as MediaTek MT6380 also has to be written in
32-bit mode. So the patch adds pwrap_write32, rename old pwrap_write
into pwrap_write16 and one additional function pointer is introduced
for increasing flexibility allowing the determination which mode is
used by the pwrap slave detection through device tree.
