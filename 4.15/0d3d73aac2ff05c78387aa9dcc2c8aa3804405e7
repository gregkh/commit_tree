perf/core: Rewrite event timekeeping

The current even timekeeping, which computes enabled and running
times, uses 3 distinct timestamps to reflect the various event states:
OFF (stopped), INACTIVE (enabled) and ACTIVE (running).

Furthermore, the update rules are such that even INACTIVE events need
their timestamps updated. This is undesirable because we'd like to not
touch INACTIVE events if at all possible, this makes event scheduling
(much) more expensive than needed.

Rewrite the timekeeping to directly use event->state, this greatly
simplifies the code and results in only having to update things when
we change state, or an up-to-date value is requested (read).
