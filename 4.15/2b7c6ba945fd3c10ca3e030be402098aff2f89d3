bpf/verifier: improve disassembly of BPF_END instructions

print_bpf_insn() was treating all BPF_ALU[64] the same, but BPF_END has a
 different structure: it has a size in insn->imm (even if it's BPF_X) and
 uses the BPF_SRC (X or K) to indicate which endianness to use.  So it
 needs different code to print it.
