fs: fuse: account fuse_inode slab memory as reclaimable

Fuse inodes are currently included in the unreclaimable slab counts -
SUnreclaim in /proc/meminfo, slab_unreclaimable in /proc/vmstat and the
per-cgroup memory.stat.  But they are reclaimable just like other
filesystems' inodes, and /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches frees them easily.

Mark the slab cache reclaimable.
