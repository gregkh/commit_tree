i2c: gpio: Add support for named gpios in DT

This adds support for using the "sda" and "scl" GPIOs in
device tree instead of anonymously using index 0 and 1 of
the "gpios" property.

We add a helper function to retrieve the GPIO descriptors
and some explicit error handling since the probe may have
to be deferred. At least this happened to me when moving
to using named "sda" and "scl" lines (all of a sudden this
started to probe before the GPIO driver) so we need to
gracefully defer probe when we ge -ENOENT in the error
pointer.
