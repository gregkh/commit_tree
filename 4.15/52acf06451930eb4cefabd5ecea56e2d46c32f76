be2net: restore properly promisc mode after queues reconfiguration

The commit 622190669403 ("be2net: Request RSS capability of Rx interface
depending on number of Rx rings") modified be_update_queues() so the
IFACE (HW representation of the netdevice) is destroyed and then
re-created. This causes a regression because potential promiscuous mode
is not restored properly during be_open() because the driver thinks
that the HW has promiscuous mode already enabled.

Note that Lancer is not affected by this bug because RX-filter flags are
disabled during be_close() for this chipset.
