powerpc/perf: Dereference BHRB entries safely

It's theoretically possible that branch instructions recorded in
BHRB (Branch History Rolling Buffer) entries have already been
unmapped before they are processed by the kernel. Hence, trying to
dereference such memory location will result in a crash. eg:

    Unable to handle kernel paging request for data at address 0xd000000019c41764
    Faulting instruction address: 0xc000000000084a14
    NIP [c000000000084a14] branch_target+0x4/0x70
    LR [c0000000000eb828] record_and_restart+0x568/0x5c0
    Call Trace:
    [c0000000000eb3b4] record_and_restart+0xf4/0x5c0 (unreliable)
    [c0000000000ec378] perf_event_interrupt+0x298/0x460
    [c000000000027964] performance_monitor_exception+0x54/0x70
    [c000000000009ba4] performance_monitor_common+0x114/0x120

Fix it by deferefencing the addresses safely.
