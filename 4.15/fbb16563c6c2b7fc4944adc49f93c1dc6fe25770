ASoC: snd_soc_component_driver has pmdown_time

Current snd_soc_runtime_ignore_pmdown_time() tallys all Codec and
CPU's "ignore_pmdown_time". Now, CPU (= via compoent)
ignore_pmdown_time is fixed as "true". Codec's one is copied from Codec
driver. This means Codec side default is "false".

Current all Codec driver will be replaced into Component, thus, we can
use for_each_rtdcom() for this totalization. This patch adds new
"pmdown_time" on Component driver. Its inverted value will be used
for this "ignore" totalizaton.

Of course all existing Component driver doesn't have its settings now,
thus, all existing "pmdown_time" is "false". This means all
Components will ignore pmdown time. This is current CPU behavior.
To keep compatibility, snd_soc_runtime_ignore_pmdown_time() totalize
Component's inverted "pmdown_time" (= total will be true) and
Codec's "ignore_pmdown_time" (= depends on Codec driver settings).
Because It is using AND operation, its result is based on Codec driver
settings only.
This means this operation can keep compatibility and doesn't have
nonconformity.

When we replace Codec to Component, the driver which has
".ignore_pmdown_time = true" will be just removed,
and the driver which doesn't have it will have new
".pmdown_time = true".
