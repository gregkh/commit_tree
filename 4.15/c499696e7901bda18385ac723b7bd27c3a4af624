net: dsa: b53: Stop using dev->cpu_port incorrectly

dev->cpu_port is the driver local information that should only be used
to look up register offsets for a particular port, when they differ
(e.g: IMP port override), but it should certainly not be used in place
of the DSA configured CPU port.

Since the DSA switch layer calls port_vlan_{add,del}() on the CPU port
as well, we can remove the specific setting of the CPU port within
port_vlan_{add,del}.
