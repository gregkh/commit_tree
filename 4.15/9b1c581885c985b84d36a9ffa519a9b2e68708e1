drm/i915/mst: Print active mst links after update

Both mst_disable_dp and mst_post_disable_dp print number of active links
before the variable has been updated. Move the print statement in
mst_disable_dp after the decrement so that the printed values indicate
the disabing of a mst connector. Also, add some text to clarify what we
are printing.
