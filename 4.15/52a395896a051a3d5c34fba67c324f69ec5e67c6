sctp: set sender next_tsn for the old result with ctsn_ack_point plus 1

When doing asoc reset, if the sender of the response has already sent some
chunk and increased asoc->next_tsn before the duplicate request comes, the
response will use the old result with an incorrect sender next_tsn.

Better than asoc->next_tsn, asoc->ctsn_ack_point can't be changed after
the sender of the response has performed the asoc reset and before the
peer has confirmed it, and it's value is still asoc->next_tsn original
value minus 1.

This patch sets sender next_tsn for the old result with ctsn_ack_point
plus 1 when processing the duplicate request, to make sure the sender
next_tsn value peer gets will be always right.
