IB/core: Only maintain real QPs in the security lists

When modify QP is called on a shared QP update the security context for
the real QP. When security is subsequently enforced the shared QP
handles will be checked as well.

Without this change shared QP handles get added to the port/pkey lists,
which is a bug, because not all shared QP handles will be checked for
access. Also the shared QP security context wouldn't get removed from
the port/pkey lists causing access to free memory and list corruption
when they are destroyed.
