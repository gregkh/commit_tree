ipvlan: implement VEPA mode

This is very similar to the Macvlan VEPA mode, however, there is some
difference. IPvlan uses the mac-address of the lower device, so the VEPA
mode has implications of ICMP-redirects for packets destined for its
immediate neighbors sharing same master since the packets will have same
source and dest mac. The external switch/router will send redirect msg.

Having said that, this will be useful tool in terms of debugging
since IPvlan will not switch packets within its slaves and rely completely
on the external entity as intended in 802.1Qbg.
