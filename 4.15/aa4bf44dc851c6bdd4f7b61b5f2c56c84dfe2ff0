userns: use union in {g,u}idmap struct

- Add a struct containing two pointer to extents and wrap both the static extent
  array and the struct into a union. This is done in preparation for bumping the
  {g,u}idmap limits for user namespaces.
- Add brackets around anonymous union when using designated initializers to
  initialize members in order to please gcc <= 4.4.
