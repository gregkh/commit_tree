xen/pvcalls: implement release command

Send PVCALLS_RELEASE to the backend and wait for a reply. Take both
in_mutex and out_mutex to avoid concurrent accesses. Then, free the
socket.

For passive sockets, check whether we have already pre-allocated an
active socket for the purpose of being accepted. If so, free that as
well.
