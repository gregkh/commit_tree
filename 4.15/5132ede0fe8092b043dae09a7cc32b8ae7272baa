Revert "module: Add retpoline tag to VERMAGIC"

This reverts commit 6cfb521ac0d5b97470883ff9b7facae264b7ab12.

Turns out distros do not want to make retpoline as part of their "ABI",
so this patch should not have been merged.  Sorry Andi, this was my
fault, I suggested it when your original patch was the "correct" way of
doing this instead.
