DLM: fix NULL pointer dereference in send_to_sock()

The writequeue and writequeue_lock member of othercon was not initialized.
If lowcomms_state_change() is called from network layer, othercon->swork
may be scheduled. In this case, send_to_sock() will generate a NULL pointer
reference. We avoid this problem by correctly initializing writequeue and
writequeue_lock member of othercon.
