RDMA/hns: Add profile support for hip08 driver

The profile's content mainly set some specifications and obtain
some hardware resources by implementing the relative commands.
Because max sge num of send queue is not the same with receive
queue in hip08, we modified the calculation of props->max_sge
in query_device ops.
