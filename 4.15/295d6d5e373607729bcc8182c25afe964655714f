sched/deadline: Fix switching to -deadline

Fix a bug introduced in:

  72f9f3fdc928 ("sched/deadline: Remove dl_new from struct sched_dl_entity")

After that commit, when switching to -deadline if the scheduling
deadline of a task is in the past then switched_to_dl() calls
setup_new_entity() to properly initialize the scheduling deadline
and runtime.

The problem is that the task is enqueued _before_ having its parameters
initialized by setup_new_entity(), and this can cause problems.
For example, a task with its out-of-date deadline in the past will
potentially be enqueued as the highest priority one; however, its
adjusted deadline may not be the earliest one.

This patch fixes the problem by initializing the task's parameters before
enqueuing it.
