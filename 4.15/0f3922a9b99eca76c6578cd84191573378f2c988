x86/Xen: don't report ancient LAPIC version

Unconditionally reporting a value seen on the P4 or older invokes
functionality like io_apic_get_unique_id() on 32-bit builds, resulting
in a panic() with sufficiently many CPUs and/or IO-APICs. Doing what
that function does would be the hypervisor's responsibility anyway, so
makes no sense to be used when running on Xen. Uniformly report a more
modern version; this shouldn't matter much as both LAPIC and IO-APIC are
being managed entirely / mostly by the hypervisor.
