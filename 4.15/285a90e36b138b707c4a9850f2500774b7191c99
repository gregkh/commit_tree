KVM: arm/arm64: VGIC: extend !vgic_is_initialized guard

Commit f39d16cbabf9 ("KVM: arm/arm64: Guard kvm_vgic_map_is_active against
!vgic_initialized") introduced a check whether the VGIC has been
initialized before accessing the spinlock and the VGIC data structure.
However the vgic_get_irq() call in the variable declaration sneaked
through the net, so lets make sure that this also gets called only after
we actually allocated the arrays this function accesses.
