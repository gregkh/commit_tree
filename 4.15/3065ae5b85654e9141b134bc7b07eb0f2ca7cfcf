btrfs: add missing device::flush_bio puts

This fixes potential bio leaks, in several error paths. Unfortunatelly
the device structure freeing is opencoded in many places and I missed
them when introducing the flush_bio.

Most of the time, devices get freed through call_rcu(..., free_device),
so it at least it's not that easy to hit the leak, but it's still
possible through the path that frees stale devices.
