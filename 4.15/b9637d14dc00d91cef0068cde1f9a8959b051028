scsi: megaraid_sas: Resize MFA frame used for IOC INIT to 4k

Older firmware version unconditionally pulls 4k frame for IOC INIT MFA
frame.  But driver allocates 1k or 4k max_chain_frame_sz based on FW
capability.  During boot time, this results in DMA read errors.
Workaround fix in driver by allocating separate ioc_init frame of 4k
size to support older firmware.
