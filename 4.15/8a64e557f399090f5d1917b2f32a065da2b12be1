gpio: pca953x: fix vendor prefix for PCA9654

Despite commit 55020c8056a8 ("of: Add vendor prefix for ON Semiconductor
Corp.") was made long ago, the latter commit 9f49f6dd0473 ("gpio: pca953x:
add onsemi,pca9654 id") made use of another, undocumented vendor prefix.
Since such prefix doesn't seem to be used in any device trees, I think we
can just fix the "compatible" string in the driver and the bindings and be
done with that...
