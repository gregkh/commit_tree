integrity: use kernel_read_file_from_path() to read x509 certs

The CONFIG_IMA_LOAD_X509 and CONFIG_EVM_LOAD_X509 options permit
loading x509 signed certificates onto the trusted keyrings without
verifying the x509 certificate file's signature.

This patch replaces the call to the integrity_read_file() specific
function with the common kernel_read_file_from_path() function.
To avoid verifying the file signature, this patch defines
READING_X509_CERTFICATE.
