dm integrity: don't store cipher request on the stack

Some asynchronous cipher implementations may use DMA.  The stack may
be mapped in the vmalloc area that doesn't support DMA.  Therefore,
the cipher request and initialization vector shouldn't be on the
stack.

Fix this by allocating the request and iv with kmalloc.
