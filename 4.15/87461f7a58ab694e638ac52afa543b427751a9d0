net: phy: DP83822 initial driver submission

Add support for the TI  DP83822 10/100Mbit ethernet phy.

The DP83822 provides flexibility to connect to a MAC through a
standard MII, RMII or RGMII interface.

In addition the DP83822 needs to be removed from the DP83848 driver
as the WoL support is added here for this device.
