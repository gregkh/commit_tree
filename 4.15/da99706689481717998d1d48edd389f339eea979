usb: xhci: Add XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH for Renesas uPD720201

When plugging in a USB webcam I see the following message:
xhci_hcd 0000:04:00.0: WARN Successful completion on short TX: needs
XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk?
handle_tx_event: 913 callbacks suppressed

All is quiet again with this patch (and I've done a fair but of soak
testing with the camera since).
