crypto: af_alg - fix race accessing cipher request

When invoking an asynchronous cipher operation, the invocation of the
callback may be performed before the subsequent operations in the
initial code path are invoked. The callback deletes the cipher request
data structure which implies that after the invocation of the
asynchronous cipher operation, this data structure must not be accessed
any more.

The setting of the return code size with the request data structure must
therefore be moved before the invocation of the asynchronous cipher
operation.
