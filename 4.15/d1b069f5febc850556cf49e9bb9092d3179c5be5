EXPERT Kconfig menu: fix broken EXPERT menu

Clean up the EXPERT menu (yet again).

Move FHANDLE and CHECKPOINT_RESTORE into the primary EXPERT menu since
they already depend on EXPERT.

Move BPF_SYSCALL and USERFAULTFD out of the EXPERT Kconfig symbols menu
list since they do not depend on EXPERT and were breaking the continuity
of that menu list.

Move all of the KALLSYMS Kconfig symbols to the end of the EXPERT menu.
This separates the kernel services from the build options.

This patch depends on [PATCH] pci: move PCI_QUIRKS to the PCI bus menu
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/2/907).
