mtd: Add sanity checks in mtd_write/read_oob()

Unlike what's done in mtd_read/write(), there are no checks to make sure
the parameters passed to mtd_read/write_oob() are consistent, which
forces implementers of ->_read/write_oob() to do it, which in turn leads
to code duplication and possibly errors in the logic.

Do general sanity checks, like ops fields consistency and range checking.
