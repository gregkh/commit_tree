openrisc: pass endianness info to sparse

openrisc is big-endian only but sparse assumes the same endianness
as the building machine.
This is problematic for code which expect __BYTE_ORDER__ being
correctly predefined by the compiler which sparse can then
pre-process differently from what gcc would, depending on the
building machine endianness.

Fix this by letting sparse know about the architecture endianness.
