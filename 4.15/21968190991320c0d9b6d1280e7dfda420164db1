xen/pvcalls: connect to the backend

Implement the probe function for the pvcalls frontend. Read the
supported versions, max-page-order and function-calls nodes from
xenstore.

Only one frontend<->backend connection is supported at any given time
for a guest. Store the active frontend device to a static pointer.

Introduce a stub functions for the event handler.
