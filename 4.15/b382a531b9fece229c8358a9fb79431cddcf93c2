sched/fair: Move enqueue migrate handling

Move the entity migrate handling from enqueue_entity_load_avg() to
update_load_avg(). This has two benefits:

 - {en,de}queue_entity_load_avg() will become purely about managing
   runnable_load

 - we can avoid a double update_tg_load_avg() and reduce pressure on
   the global tg->shares cacheline

The reason we do this is so that we can change update_cfs_shares() to
change both weight and (future) runnable_weight. For this to work we
need to have the cfs_rq averages up-to-date (which means having done
the attach), but we need the cfs_rq->avg.runnable_avg to not yet
include the se's contribution (since se->on_rq == 0).
