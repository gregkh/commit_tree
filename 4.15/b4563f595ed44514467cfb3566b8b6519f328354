drm/i915: Pin fence for iomap

Acquire the fence register for the iomap in i915_vma_pin_iomap() on
behalf of the caller.

We probably want for the caller to specify whether the fence should be
pinned for their usage, but at the moment all callers do want the
associated fence, or none, so take it on their behalf.
