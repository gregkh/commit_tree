scsi: bfa: integer overflow in debugfs

We could allocate less memory than intended because we do:

	bfad->regdata = kzalloc(len << 2, GFP_KERNEL);

The shift can overflow leading to a crash.  This is debugfs code so the
impact is very small.  I fixed the network version of this in March with
commit 13e2d5187f6b ("bna: integer overflow bug in debugfs").

Fixes: ab2a9ba189e8 ("[SCSI] bfa: add debugfs support")
