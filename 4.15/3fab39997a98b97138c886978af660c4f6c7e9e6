arm64/sve: Report SVE to userspace via CPUID only if supported

Currently, the SVE field in ID_AA64PFR0_EL1 is visible
unconditionally to userspace via the CPU ID register emulation,
irrespective of the kernel config.  This means that if a kernel
configured with CONFIG_ARM64_SVE=n is run on SVE-capable hardware,
userspace will see SVE reported as present in the ID regs even
though the kernel forbids execution of SVE instructions.

This patch makes the exposure of the SVE field in ID_AA64PFR0_EL1
conditional on CONFIG_ARM64_SVE=y.

Since future architecture features are likely to encounter a
similar requirement, this patch adds a suitable helper macros for
use when declaring config-conditional ID register fields.
