net: phy: micrel: ksz9031: reconfigure autoneg after phy autoneg workaround

Under some circumstances driver will perform PHY reset in
ksz9031_read_status() to fix autoneg failure case (idle error count =
0xFF). When this happens ksz9031 will not detect link status change any
more when connecting to Netgear 1G switch (link can be recovered sometimes by
restarting netdevice "ifconfig down up"). Reproduced with TI am572x board
equipped with ksz9031 PHY while connecting to Netgear 1G switch.

Fix the issue by reconfiguring autonegotiation after PHY reset in
ksz9031_read_status().
