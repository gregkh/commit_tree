ALSA: aloop: Release cable upon open error path

The aloop runtime object and its assignment in the cable are left even
when opening a substream fails.  This doesn't mean any memory leak,
but it still keeps the invalid pointer that may be referred by the
another side of the cable spontaneously, which is a potential Oops
cause.

Clean up the cable assignment and the empty cable upon the error path
properly.
