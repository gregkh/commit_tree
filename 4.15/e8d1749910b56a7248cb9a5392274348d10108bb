bpf: Test deletion in BPF_MAP_TYPE_LPM_TRIE

Extend the 'random' operation tests to include a delete operation
(delete half of the nodes from both lpm implementions and ensure
that lookups are still equivalent).

Also, add a simple IPv4 test which verifies lookup behavior as nodes
are deleted from the tree.
