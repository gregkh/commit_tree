drm/fb-helper: Avoid NULL ptr dereference in fb_set_suspend()

drm_fb_helper_resume_worker() uses fb_helper->fbdev to call
fb_set_suspend() which dereferences the pointer.
Move sync-canceling of the resume worker in drm_fb_helper_fini() before
setting fb_helper->fbdev to NULL. Move dirty_work as well.
