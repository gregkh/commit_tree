KVM: SVM: detect opening of SMI window using STGI intercept

Commit 05cade71cf3b ("KVM: nSVM: fix SMI injection in guest mode") made
KVM mask SMI if GIF=0 but it didn't do anything to unmask it when GIF is
enabled.

The issue manifests for me as a significantly longer boot time of Windows
guests when running with SMM-enabled OVMF.

This commit fixes it by intercepting STGI instead of requesting immediate
exit if the reason why SMM was masked is GIF.
