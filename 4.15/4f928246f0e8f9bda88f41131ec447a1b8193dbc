ALSA: sb: Convert timers to use timer_setup()

In preparation for unconditionally passing the struct timer_list pointer to
all timer callbacks, switch to using the new timer_setup() and from_timer()
to pass the timer pointer explicitly.

[Re-use the existing chip->midi_substream_output instead of assigning
 a new field to struct snd_sb -- tiwai]
