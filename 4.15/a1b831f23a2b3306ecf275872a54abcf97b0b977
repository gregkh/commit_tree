xfrm: eradicate size_t

All netlink message sizes are a) unsigned, b) can't be >= 4GB in size
because netlink doesn't support >= 64KB messages in the first place.

All those size_t across the code are a scam especially across networking
which likes to work with small numbers like 1500 or 65536.

Propagate unsignedness and flip some "int" to "unsigned int" as well.

This is preparation to switching nlmsg_new() to "unsigned int".
