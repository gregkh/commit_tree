drm/amdgpu: set sched_hw_submission higher for KIQ (v3)

KIQ doesn't really use the GPU scheduler.  The base
drivers generally use the KIQ ring directly rather than
submitting IBs.  However, amdgpu_sched_hw_submission
(which defaults to 2) limits the number of outstanding
fences to 2.  KFD uses the KIQ for TLB flushes and the
2 fence limit hurts performance when there are several KFD
processes running.

v2: move some expressions to one line
    change KIQ sched_hw_submission to at least 16
v3: bump to 256
