net/mlx5e: Fix fixpoint divide exception in mlx5e_am_stats_compare

Helmut reported a bug about division by zero while
running traffic and doing physical cable pull test.

When the cable unplugged the ppms become zero, so when
dividing the current ppms by the previous ppms in the
next dim iteration there is division by zero.

This patch prevent this division for both ppms and epms.
