lightnvm: pblk: avoid being reported as hung on rated GC

The amount of GC I/O on the write buffer is managed by the rate-limiter,
which is calculated as a function of the number of available free
blocks. When reaching the stable point, we risk having scheduled more
I/Os for GC than are allowed on the write buffer. This would result on
the GC semaphore balancing the outstanding read GC I/Os to be reported
as "hung", though the behavior is normal.

Solve this by allowing to schedule when we detect that the read GC path
is not moving forward.
