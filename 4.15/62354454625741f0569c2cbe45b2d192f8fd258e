USB: uas and storage: Add US_FL_BROKEN_FUA for another JMicron JMS567 ID

There is another JMS567-based USB3 UAS enclosure (152d:0578) that fails
with the following error:

[sda] tag#0 FAILED Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE
[sda] tag#0 Sense Key : Illegal Request [current]
[sda] tag#0 Add. Sense: Invalid field in cdb

The issue occurs both with UAS (occasionally) and mass storage
(immediately after mounting a FS on a disk in the enclosure).

Enabling US_FL_BROKEN_FUA quirk solves this issue.

This patch adds an UNUSUAL_DEV with US_FL_BROKEN_FUA for the enclosure
for both UAS and mass storage.
