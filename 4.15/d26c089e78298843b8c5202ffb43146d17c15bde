hdlc: Convert timers to use timer_setup()

In preparation for unconditionally passing the struct timer_list pointer to
all timer callbacks, switch to using the new timer_setup() and from_timer()
to pass the timer pointer explicitly. This adds a pointer back to the
net_device, and drops needless open-coded resetting of the .function and
.data fields.
