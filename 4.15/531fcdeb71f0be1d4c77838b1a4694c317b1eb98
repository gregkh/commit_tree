thermal: imx: add NVMEM dependency

The driver now fails to link into vmlinux when CONFIG_NVMEM is a loadable
module:

drivers/thermal/imx_thermal.o: In function `imx_thermal_probe':
imx_thermal.c:(.text+0x360): undefined reference to `nvmem_cell_read_u32'
imx_thermal.c:(.text+0x360): relocation truncated to fit: R_AARCH64_CALL26 against undefined symbol `nvmem_cell_read_u32'
imx_thermal.c:(.text+0x388): undefined reference to `nvmem_cell_read_u32'
imx_thermal.c:(.text+0x388): relocation truncated to fit: R_AARCH64_CALL26 against undefined symbol `nvmem_cell_read_u32'

This adds a Kconfig dependency to force it to be a module as well
when its dependency is loadable.
