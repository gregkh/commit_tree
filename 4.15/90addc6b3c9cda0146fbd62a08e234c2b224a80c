scsi: use dma_get_cache_alignment() as minimum DMA alignment

In non-coherent DMA mode, kernel uses cache flushing operations to
maintain I/O coherency, so scsi's block queue should be aligned to the
value returned by dma_get_cache_alignment().  Otherwise, If a DMA buffer
and a kernel structure share a same cache line, and if the kernel
structure has dirty data, cache_invalidate (no writeback) will cause
data corruption.
