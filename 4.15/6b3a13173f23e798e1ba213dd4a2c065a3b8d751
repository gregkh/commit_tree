tpm_tis_spi: Use DMA-safe memory for SPI transfers

The buffers used as tx_buf/rx_buf in a SPI transfer need to be DMA-safe.
This cannot be guaranteed for the buffers passed to tpm_tis_spi_read_bytes
and tpm_tis_spi_write_bytes. Therefore, we need to use our own DMA-safe
buffer and copy the data to/from it.

The buffer needs to be allocated separately, to ensure that it is
cacheline-aligned and not shared with other data, so that DMA can work
correctly.
