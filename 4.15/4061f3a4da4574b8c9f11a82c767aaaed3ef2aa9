IB/hfi1: Race condition between user notification and driver state

The handler for link init state (HLS_UP_INIT) notifies userspace
(update_statusp()) before enabling the device
(RCV_CTRL_RCV_PORT_ENABLE_SMASK) or setting the device state
(ppd->host_link_state).  This causes a race condition where the
userspace thinks the interface is in the INIT state before the driver
has set that state.

Rework the code path to eliminate the race.

Delay setting the init state until after a HW settling period.
