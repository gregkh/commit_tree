ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential out-of-bound access at parsing SU

The usb-audio driver may trigger an out-of-bound access at parsing a
malformed selector unit, as it checks the header length only after
evaluating bNrInPins field, which can be already above the given
length.  Fix it by adding the length check beforehand.
