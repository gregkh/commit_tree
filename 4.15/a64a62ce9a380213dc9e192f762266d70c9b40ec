ACPI / EC: Fix regression related to PM ops support in ECDT device

On platforms (ASUS X550ZE and possibly all ASUS X series) with valid ECDT
EC but invalid DSDT EC, EC PM ops won't be invoked as ECDT EC is not an
ACPI device. Thus the following commit actually removed post-resume
acpi_ec_enable_event() invocation for such platforms, and triggered a
regression on them that after being resumed, EC (actually should be ECDT)
driver stops handling EC events:

 Subject: ACPI / EC: Add PM operations to improve event handling for resume process

Notice that the root cause actually is "ECDT is not an ACPI device" rather
than "the timing of acpi_ec_enable_event() invocation", this patch fixes
this issue by enumerating ECDT EC as an ACPI device. Due to the existence
of the noirq stage, the ability of tuning the timing of
acpi_ec_enable_event() invocation is still meaningful.

This patch is a little bit different from the posted fix by moving
acpi_config_boot_ec() from acpi_ec_ecdt_start() to acpi_ec_add() to make
sure that EC event handling won't be stopped as long as the ACPI EC driver
is bound. Thus the following sequence shouldn't disable EC event handling:
unbind,suspend,resume,bind.
