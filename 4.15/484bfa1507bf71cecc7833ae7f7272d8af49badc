Revert "net: bcmgenet: Software reset EPHY after power on"

With commit f7d72996e222 ("net: bcmgenet: enable loopback during
UniMAC sw_reset") it is no longer necessary to force the software
reset of the internal EPHY before resetting the UniMAC to ensure a
clean reset.

Therefore this commit reverts commit 5dbebbb44a6a ("net: bcmgenet:
Software reset EPHY after power on").
