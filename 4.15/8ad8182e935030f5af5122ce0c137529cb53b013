KVM: VMX: Don't expose unrestricted_guest is enabled if ept is disabled

SDM mentioned:

 "If either the â€œunrestricted guestâ€ VM-execution control or the â€œmode-based
  execute control for EPTâ€ VM- execution control is 1, the â€œenable EPTâ€
  VM-execution control must also be 1."

However, we can still observe unrestricted_guest is Y after inserting the kvm-intel.ko
w/ ept=N. It depends on later starts a guest in order that the function
vmx_compute_secondary_exec_control() can be executed, then both the module parameter
and exec control fields will be amended.

This patch fixes it by amending module parameter immediately during vmcs data setup.
