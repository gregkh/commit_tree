mmc: block: Ensure that debugfs files are removed

The card is not necessarily being removed, but the debugfs files must be
removed when the driver is removed, otherwise they will continue to exist
after unbinding the card from the driver. e.g.

  # echo "mmc1:0001" > /sys/bus/mmc/drivers/mmcblk/unbind
  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/mmc1/mmc1\:0001/ext_csd
  [  173.634584] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000050
  [  173.643356] IP: mmc_ext_csd_open+0x5e/0x170

A complication is that the debugfs_root may have already been removed, so
check for that too.
