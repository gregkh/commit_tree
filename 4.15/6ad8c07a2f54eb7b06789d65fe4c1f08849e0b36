scsi: lpfc: Extend RDP support

Support RDP and Multiple Frames

If the remote Nport is not logged in, the driver would not populate all
the descriptors in the RDP response payload. Doing so would create a
payload length that requires multiple frames due to exceeding the
default rx buffer size without an explicit login. Currently FC-LS
explicitly states the RDP response must be a single frame sequence.
Thus we did not violate the standard.

Recently, a modification to FC-LS was accepted which allows multi-frame
sequences and all vendors have indicated they are interoperable with the
change. As such, extend RDP support with the additional fields and send
a multi-frame sequence.
