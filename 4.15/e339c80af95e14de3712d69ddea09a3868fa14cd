mailbox: mailbox-test: don't rely on rx_buffer content to signal data ready

Currently we rely on the first byte of the Rx buffer to check if there's
any data available to be read. If the first byte of the received buffer
is zero (i.e. null character), then we fail to signal that data is
available even when it's available.

Instead introduce a boolean variable to track the data availability and
update it in the channel receive callback as ready and clear it when the
data is read.
