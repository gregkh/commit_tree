mmc: block: Prepare CQE data

Enhance mmc_blk_data_prep() to support CQE requests. That means adding
some things that for non-CQE requests would be encoded into the command
arguments - such as the block address, reliable-write flag, and data tag
flag. Also the request tag is needed to provide the command queue task id,
and a comment is added to explain the future possibility of defining a
priority.
