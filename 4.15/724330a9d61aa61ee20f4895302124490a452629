staging: iio: tsl2x7x: put function definitions on a single line

The functions tsl2x7x_invoke_change() and tsl2x7x_prox_calculate() are
short enough that the return value and static declaration can be moved
onto the same line with the function name. This patch makes that change
to increase code readability.
