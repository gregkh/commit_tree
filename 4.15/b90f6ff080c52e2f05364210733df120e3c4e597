md: don't check MD_SB_CHANGE_CLEAN in md_allow_write

Only MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING should be used to wait for transition from
clean to dirty. Checking also MD_SB_CHANGE_CLEAN is unnecessary and can
race with e.g. md_do_sync(). This sporadically causes a hang when
changing consistency policy during resync:
