x86/efi: Fix kernel param add_efi_memmap regression

'add_efi_memmap' is an early param, but do_add_efi_memmap() has no
chance to run because the code path is before parse_early_param().
I believe it worked when the param was introduced but probably later
some other changes caused the wrong order and nobody noticed it.

Move efi_memblock_x86_reserve_range() after parse_early_param()
to fix it.
