nfs: Fix ugly referral attributes

Before traversing a referral and performing a mount, the mounted-on
directory looks strange:

dr-xr-xr-x. 2 4294967294 4294967294 0 Dec 31  1969 dir.0

nfs4_get_referral is wiping out any cached attributes with what was
returned via GETATTR(fs_locations), but the bit mask for that
operation does not request any file attributes.

Retrieve owner and timestamp information so that the memcpy in
nfs4_get_referral fills in more attributes.

Changes since v1:
- Don't request attributes that the client unconditionally replaces
- Request only MOUNTED_ON_FILEID or FILEID attribute, not both
- encode_fs_locations() doesn't use the third bitmask word
