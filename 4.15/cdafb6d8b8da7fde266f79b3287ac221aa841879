usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix use-after-free in ffs_free_inst

KASAN enabled configuration reports an error

BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in ffs_free_inst+... [usb_f_fs] at addr ...
Write of size 8 by task ...

This is observed after "ffs-test" is run and interrupted. If after that
functionfs is unmounted and g_ffs module is unloaded, that use-after-free
occurs during g_ffs module removal.

Although the report indicates ffs_free_inst() function, the actual
use-after-free condition occurs in _ffs_free_dev() function, which
is probably inlined into ffs_free_inst().

This happens due to keeping the ffs_data reference in device structure
during functionfs unmounting, while ffs_data itself is freed as no longer
needed. The fix is to clear that reference in ffs_closed() function,
which is a counterpart of ffs_ready(), where the reference is stored.
