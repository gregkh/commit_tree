drivers/firmware: psci: Convert timers to use timer_setup()

In preparation for unconditionally passing the struct timer_list pointer to
all timer callbacks, switch to using the new timer_setup() and from_timer()
to pass the timer pointer explicitly. Also adds missing call to
destroy_timer_on_stack().
