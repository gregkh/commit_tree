scsi: ufs: ufshcd: fix potential NULL pointer dereference in ufshcd_config_vreg

_vreg_ is being dereferenced before it is null checked, hence there is a
potential null pointer dereference.

Fix this by moving the pointer dereference after _vreg_ has been null
checked.

This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
