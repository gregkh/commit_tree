btrfs: Use bd_dev to generate index when dev_state_hashtable add items.

Fix missing change from commit f8f84b2dfda5
("btrfs: index check-integrity state hash by a dev_t").

Function btrfsic_dev_state_hashtable_lookup uses dev_t to generate hashval
when look in up a btrfsic_dev_state in hash table. So when we add a
btrfsic_dev_state into the hash table, it should also use dev_t.

Reproducer of this bug:
Use MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o check_int" when running xfstest, device can not be
mounted successfully. So xfstest can not run.
