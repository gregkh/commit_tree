livepatch: add (un)patch callbacks

Provide livepatch modules a klp_object (un)patching notification
mechanism.  Pre and post-(un)patch callbacks allow livepatch modules to
setup or synchronize changes that would be difficult to support in only
patched-or-unpatched code contexts.

Callbacks can be registered for target module or vmlinux klp_objects,
but each implementation is klp_object specific.

  - Pre-(un)patch callbacks run before any (un)patching transition
    starts.

  - Post-(un)patch callbacks run once an object has been (un)patched and
    the klp_patch fully transitioned to its target state.

Example use cases include modification of global data and registration
of newly available services/handlers.

See Documentation/livepatch/callbacks.txt for details and
samples/livepatch/ for examples.
