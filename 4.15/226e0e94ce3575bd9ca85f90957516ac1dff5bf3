nfp: bpf: remove register rename

Remove the register renumbering optimization.  To implement calling
map and other helpers we need more strict register layout.  We can't
freely reassign register numbers.

This will have the effect of running in 4 context/thread mode, which
should be OK since we are moving towards integrating the BPF closer
with FW app datapath anyway, and the target datapath itself runs in
4 context mode.
