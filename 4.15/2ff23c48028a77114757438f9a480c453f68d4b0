serial: mvebu-uart: clear state register before IRQ request

When receiving data on RX pin before ->uart_startup() is called, some
error bits in the state register could be set up (like BRK_DET).

This is harmless when using only the standard UART (error bits are
read-only), but may procude an endless loop once in the extended UART
RX interrupt handler (error bits must be cleared).

Clear the status register in ->uart_startup() to avoid this situation.
