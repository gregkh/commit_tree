platform/x86: hp_accel: Add quirk for HP ProBook 440 G4

Added support for HP ProBook 440 G4 laptops by including the accelerometer
orientation quirk for that device. Testing was performed based on the
axis orientation guidelines here:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/misc-devices/lis3lv02d
which states "If the left side is elevated, X increases (becomes positive)".

When tested, on lifting the left edge, x values became increasingly negative
thus indicating an inverted x-axis on the installed lis3lv02d chip.
This was compensated by adding an entry for this device in hp_accel.c
specifying the quirk as x_inverted. The patch was tested on a
ProBook 440 G4 device and x-axis as well as y and z-axis values are now
generated as per spec.
