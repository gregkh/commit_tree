xfs: don't rely on extent indices in xfs_bmap_insert_extents

Rewrite xfs_bmap_insert_extents so that we don't rely on extent indices
except for iterating over them.  Not being able to iterate to the previous
extent or finding the extent that stop_fsb is in are sufficient exit
conditions, and we don't need to do any extent count games given that:

  a) we already flushed all delalloc extents past our start offset
     before doing the operation
  b) xfs_iext_count() includes delalloc extents anyway
