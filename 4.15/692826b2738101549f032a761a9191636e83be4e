btrfs: handle errors while updating refcounts in update_ref_for_cow

Since commit fb235dc06fa (btrfs: qgroup: Move half of the qgroup
accounting time out of commit trans) the assumption that
btrfs_add_delayed_{data,tree}_ref can only return 0 or -ENOMEM has
been false.  The qgroup operations call into btrfs_search_slot
and friends and can now return the full spectrum of error codes.

Fortunately, the fix here is easy since update_ref_for_cow failing
is already handled so we just need to bail early with the error
code.
