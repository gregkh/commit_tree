drm/amd/display: dce110: fix plane validation

For MPO to work with per surface rendering and flipping,
the previous logic of restricting plane[1] only as underlay
needs to be removed.
validate_surface_sets() now checks only the width and height
bounds in case of underlay rather than checking format.

Without this patch one cannot set underlay only.
