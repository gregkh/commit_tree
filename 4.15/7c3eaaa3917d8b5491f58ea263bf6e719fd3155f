s390/kexec: Fix checksum validation return code for kdump

Before kexec boots to a crash kernel it checks whether the image in memory
changed after load. This is done by the function kdump_csum_valid, which
returns true, i.e. an int != 0, on success and 0 otherwise. In other words
when kdump_csum_valid returns an error code it means that the validation
succeeded. This is not only counterintuitive but also produces the wrong
result if the kernel was build without CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP. Fix this by
making kdump_csum_valid return a bool.
