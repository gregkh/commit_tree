vmbus: add per-channel sysfs info

This extends existing vmbus related sysfs structure to provide per-channel
state information. This is useful when diagnosing issues with multiple
queues in networking and storage.

The existing sysfs only displayed information about the primary
channel. The one place it reported multiple channels was the
channel_vp_mapping file which violated the sysfs convention
of one value per file.
