platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: Add Lenovo Yoga 920-13IKB to no_hw_rfkill dmi list

The Lenovo Yoga 920-13IKB does not have a hw rfkill switch, and trying
to read the hw rfkill switch through the ideapad module causes it to
always report as blocked.

This commit adds the Lenovo Yoga 920-13IKB to the no_hw_rfkill dmi list,
fixing the WiFI breakage.
