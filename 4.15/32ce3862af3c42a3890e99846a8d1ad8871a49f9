powerpc/lib: Implement PMEM API

Implement the architecture specific cache maintence functions that make
up the "PMEM API". Currently the writeback and invalidate functions
are the same since the function of the DCBST (data cache block store)
instruction is typically interpreted as "writeback to the point of
coherency" rather than to memory. As a result implementing the API
requires a full cache flush rather than just a cache write back. This
will probably change in the not-too-distant future.
