ASoC: rt5663: Delay and retry reading rt5663 ID register

In the probe, the codec may not be ready for I2C reading or there are some
glitches on the i2c line. So if the i2c reading value is incorrect, it will
read again after delay. This issue is similar the patch
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9681421/. In current project, these 2
devices were connected to the same i2c line, and they met the same problem.
