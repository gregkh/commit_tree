x86: Use lockdep to assert IRQs are disabled/enabled

Use lockdep to check that IRQs are enabled or disabled as expected. This
way the sanity check only shows overhead when concurrency correctness
debug code is enabled.

It also makes no more sense to fix the IRQ flags when a bug is detected
as the assertion is now pure config-dependent debugging. And to quote
Peter Zijlstra:

	The whole if !disabled, disable logic is uber paranoid programming,
	but I don't think we've ever seen that WARN trigger, and if it does
	(and then burns the kernel) we at least know what happend.
