fscrypt: clean up include file mess

Filesystems have to include different header files based on whether they
are compiled with encryption support or not. That's nasty and messy.

Instead, rationalise the headers so we have a single include fscrypt.h
and let it decide what internal implementation to include based on the
__FS_HAS_ENCRYPTION define.  Filesystems set __FS_HAS_ENCRYPTION to 1
before including linux/fscrypt.h if they are built with encryption
support.  Otherwise, they must set __FS_HAS_ENCRYPTION to 0.

Add guards to prevent fscrypt_supp.h and fscrypt_notsupp.h from being
directly included by filesystems.
