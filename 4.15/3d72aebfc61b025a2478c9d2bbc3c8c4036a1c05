i40e: Fix for NUP NVM image downgrade failure

Since commit 96a39aed25e6 ("i40e: Acquire NVM lock before
reads on all devices") we've used the NVM lock
to synchronize NVM reads even on devices which don't strictly
need the lock.

Doing so can cause a regression on older firmware prior to 1.5,
especially when downgrading the firmware.

Fix this by only grabbing the lock if we're running on an X722
device (which requires the lock as it uses the AdminQ to read
the NVM), or if we're currently running 1.5 or newer firmware.
