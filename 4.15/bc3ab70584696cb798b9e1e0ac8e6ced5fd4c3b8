s390/qeth: fix thinko in IPv4 multicast address tracking

Commit 5f78e29ceebf ("qeth: optimize IP handling in rx_mode callback")
reworked how secondary addresses are managed for qeth devices.
Instead of dropping & subsequently re-adding all addresses on every
ndo_set_rx_mode() call, qeth now keeps track of the addresses that are
currently registered with the HW.
On a ndo_set_rx_mode(), we thus only need to do (de-)registration
requests for the addresses that have actually changed.

On L3 devices, the lookup for IPv4 Multicast addresses checks the wrong
hashtable - and thus never finds a match. As a result, we first delete
*all* such addresses, and then re-add them again. So each set_rx_mode()
causes a short period where the IPv4 Multicast addresses are not
registered, and the card stops forwarding inbound traffic for them.

Fix this by setting the ->is_multicast flag on the lookup object, thus
enabling qeth_l3_ip_from_hash() to search the correct hashtable and
find a match there.
