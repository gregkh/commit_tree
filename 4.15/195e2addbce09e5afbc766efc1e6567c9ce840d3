SolutionEngine771x: fix Ether platform data

The 'sh_eth' driver's probe() method would fail  on the SolutionEngine7710
board and crash on SolutionEngine7712 board  as the platform code is
hopelessly behind the driver's platform data --  it passes the PHY address
instead of 'struct sh_eth_plat_data *'; pass the latter to the driver in
order to fix the bug...
