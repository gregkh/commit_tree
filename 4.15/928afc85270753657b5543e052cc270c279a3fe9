uas: ignore UAS for Norelsys NS1068(X) chips

The UAS mode of Norelsys NS1068(X) is reported to fail to work on
several platforms with the following error message:

xhci-hcd xhci-hcd.0.auto: ERROR Transfer event for unknown stream ring slot 1 ep 8
xhci-hcd xhci-hcd.0.auto: @00000000bf04a400 00000000 00000000 1b000000 01098001

And when trying to mount a partition on the disk the disk will
disconnect from the USB controller, then after re-connecting the device
will be offlined and not working at all.

Falling back to USB mass storage can solve this problem, so ignore UAS
function of this chip.
