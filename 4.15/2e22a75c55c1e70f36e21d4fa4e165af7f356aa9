ixgbe: Clear SWFW_SYNC register during init

Added clearing of SW resource bits in the SW/FW synchronization
register to ixgbe_init_swfw_sync_X540().

Updated ixgbe_acquire_swfw_sync_X540 SW Manageability host interface
resource bit error case to match the error handling of the other SW
resource bits. Which is to release the SW resource bits if SW times
out while attempting to acquire the resource.

This allows the driver to load in cases where the semaphore bits
could be stuck after a reset or a crash.
