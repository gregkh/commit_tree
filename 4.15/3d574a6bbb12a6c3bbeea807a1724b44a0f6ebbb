drm/i915: Remove walk over obj->vma_list for the shrinker

In the next patch, we want to reduce the lock coverage within the
shrinker, and one of the dangerous walks we have is over obj->vma_list.
We are only walking the obj->vma_list in order to check whether it has
been permanently pinned by HW access, typically via use on the scanout.
But we have a couple of other long term pins, the context objects for
which we currently have to check the individual vma pin_count. If we
instead mark these using obj->pin_display, we can forgo the dangerous
and sometimes slow list iteration.

v2: Rearrange code to try and avoid confusion from false associations
due to arrangement of whitespace along with rebasing on obj->pin_global.
