ARM: dts: exynos: Add support for Hardkernel's Odroid HC1 board

Odroid HC1 board is based on Odroid XU4 board, but it has no HDMI,
no eMMC, no built-in USB3.0 hub, no extension port pins, and no GPIO
button. USB3.0 ports are used for built-in JMicron USB to SATA bridge
and Gigabit R8152 ethernet chips. HC1 uses only passive cooling.
