iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Avoid ILLEGAL setting of STE.S1STALLD and CD.S

According to Spec, it is ILLEGAL to set STE.S1STALLD if STALL_MODEL
is not 0b00, which means we should not disable stall mode if stall
or terminate mode is not configuable.

Meanwhile, it is also ILLEGAL when STALL_MODEL==0b10 && CD.S==0 which
means if stall mode is force we should always set CD.S.

As Jean-Philippe's suggestion, this patch introduce a feature bit
ARM_SMMU_FEAT_STALL_FORCE, which means smmu only supports stall force.
Therefore, we can avoid the ILLEGAL setting of STE.S1STALLD.by checking
ARM_SMMU_FEAT_STALL_FORCE.

This patch keeps the ARM_SMMU_FEAT_STALLS as the meaning of stall supported
(force or configuable) to easy to expand the future function, i.e. we can
only use ARM_SMMU_FEAT_STALLS to check whether we should register fault
handle or enable master can_stall, etc to supporte platform SVM.

The feature bit, STE.S1STALLD and CD.S setting will be like:

STALL_MODEL  FEATURE                                         S1STALLD CD.S
0b00         ARM_SMMU_FEAT_STALLS                                 0b1 0b0
0b01         !ARM_SMMU_FEAT_STALLS && !ARM_SMMU_FEAT_STALL_FORCE  0b0 0b0
0b10         ARM_SMMU_FEAT_STALLS && ARM_SMMU_FEAT_STALL_FORCE    0b0 0b1

after apply this patch.
