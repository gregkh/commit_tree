usb: r8a66597-hcd: Convert timers to use timer_setup()

In preparation for unconditionally passing the struct timer_list pointer to
all timer callbacks, switch to using the new timer_setup() and from_timer()
to pass the timer pointer explicitly. This rearranges the arrays of timers
to minimize the need for a pointer back to the main structure.
