drivers/fsi: make a couple of functions static

The functions fsi_slave_report_and_clear_errors and fsi_slave_handle_error
are local to the source and do not need to be in global scope, so make
them static.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
symbol 'fsi_slave_report_and_clear_errors' was not declared. Should it
be static?
symbol 'fsi_slave_handle_error' was not declared. Should it be static?
