firmware: cleanup FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL message

The help for FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL still references the firmware_install
command that was recently removed by commit 5620a0d1aacd ("firmware:
delete in-kernel firmware").

Clean up the message to direct the user to their distribution's
linux-firmware package, and remove any reference to firmware being
included in the kernel source tree.

Fixes: 5620a0d1aacd ("firmware: delete in-kernel firmware").
