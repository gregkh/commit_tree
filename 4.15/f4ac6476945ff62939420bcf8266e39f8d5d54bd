libata: Add new med_power_with_dipm link_power_management_policy setting

As described by Matthew Garret quite a while back:
https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/34868.html

Intel CPUs starting with the Haswell generation need SATA links to power
down for the "package" part of the CPU to reach low power-states like
PC7 / P8 which bring a significant power-saving with them.

The default max_performance lpm policy does not allow for these high
PC states, both the medium_power and min_power policies do allow this.

The min_power policy saves significantly more power, but there are some
reports of some disks / SSDs not liking min_power leading to system
crashes and in some cases even data corruption has been reported.

Matthew has found a document documenting the default settings of
Intel's IRST Windows driver with which most laptops ship:
https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/dam/doc/reference-guide/sata-devices-implementation-recommendations.pdf

Matthew wrote a patch changing med_power to match those defaults, but
that never got anywhere as some people where reporting issues with the
patch-set that patch was a part of.

This commit is another attempt to make the default IRST driver settings
available under Linux, but instead of changing medium_power and
potentially introducing regressions, this commit adds a new
med_power_with_dipm setting which is identical to the existing
medium_power accept that it enables dipm on top, which makes it match
the Windows IRST driver settings, which should hopefully be safe to
use on most devices.

The med_power_with_dipm setting is close to min_power, except that:
a) It does not use host-initiated slumber mode (ASP not set),
   but it does allow device-initiated slumber
b) It does not enable DevSlp mode

On my T440s test laptop I get the following power savings when idle:
medium_power		0.9W
med_power_with_dipm	1.2W
min_power		1.2W
