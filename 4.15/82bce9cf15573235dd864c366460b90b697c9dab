ARM: dts: exynos: Remove redundant interrupt properties in gpio-keys on Odroid boards

GPIO keys don't need interrupt property. Interrupt number can be derived
directly from the GPIO pin definition, so remove redundant 'interrupts'
and 'interrupt-parent' properties from gpio-keys nodes on
Exynos4412-based Odroid boards.
