KVM: nVMX: Fix vmx_check_nested_events() return value in case an event was reinjected to L2

vmx_check_nested_events() should return -EBUSY only in case there is a
pending L1 event which requires a VMExit from L2 to L1 but such a
VMExit is currently blocked. Such VMExits are blocked either
because nested_run_pending=1 or an event was reinjected to L2.
vmx_check_nested_events() should return 0 in case there are no
pending L1 events which requires a VMExit from L2 to L1 or if
a VMExit from L2 to L1 was done internally.

However, upstream commit which introduced blocking in case an event was
reinjected to L2 (commit acc9ab601327 ("KVM: nVMX: Fix pending events
injection")) contains a bug: It returns -EBUSY even if there are no
pending L1 events which requires VMExit from L2 to L1.

This commit fix this issue.
