drm/vc4: Account for interrupts in flight

Synchronously disable the IRQ to make the following cancel_work_sync
invocation effective.

An interrupt in flight could enqueue further overflow mem work. As we
free the binner BO immediately following vc4_irq_uninstall this caused
a NULL pointer dereference in the work callback vc4_overflow_mem_work.
