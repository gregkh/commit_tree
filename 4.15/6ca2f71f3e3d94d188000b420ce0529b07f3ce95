lightnvm: pblk: simplify path on REQ_PREFLUSH

On REQ_PREFLUSH, directly tag the I/O context flags to signal a flush in
the write to cache path, instead of finding the correct entry context
and imposing a memory barrier. This simplifies the code and might
potentially prevent race conditions when adding functionality to the
write path.
