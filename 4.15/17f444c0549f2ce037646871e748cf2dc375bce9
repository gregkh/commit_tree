powerpc/vphn: Update CPU topology when VPHN enabled

powerpc/vphn: On Power systems with shared configurations of CPUs
and memory, there are some issues with the association of additional
CPUs and memory to nodes when hot-adding resources.  This patch
corrects the currently broken capability to set the topology for
shared CPUs in LPARs.  At boot time for shared CPU lpars, the
topology for each CPU was being set to node zero.  Now when
numa_update_cpu_topology() is called appropriately, the Virtual
Processor Home Node (VPHN) capabilities information provided by the
pHyp allows the appropriate node in the shared configuration to be
selected for the CPU.
