KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add infrastructure for running HPT guests on radix host

This sets up the machinery for switching a guest between HPT (hashed
page table) and radix MMU modes, so that in future we can run a HPT
guest on a radix host on POWER9 machines.

* The KVM_PPC_CONFIGURE_V3_MMU ioctl can now specify either HPT or
  radix mode, on a radix host.

* The KVM_CAP_PPC_MMU_HASH_V3 capability now returns 1 on POWER9
  with HV KVM on a radix host.

* The KVM_PPC_GET_SMMU_INFO returns information about the HPT MMU on a
  radix host.

* The KVM_PPC_ALLOCATE_HTAB ioctl on a radix host will switch the
  guest to HPT mode and allocate a HPT.

* For simplicity, we now allocate the rmap array for each memslot,
  even on a radix host, since it will be needed if the guest switches
  to HPT mode.

* Since we cannot yet run a HPT guest on a radix host, the KVM_RUN
  ioctl will return an EINVAL error in that case.
