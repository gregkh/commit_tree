Documentation: fix docs build error after source file removed

The pci/htirq.c file was removed so remove it from the documentation
file also.

Error: Cannot open file ../drivers/pci/htirq.c
WARNING: kernel-doc '../scripts/kernel-doc -rst -enable-lineno -export ../drivers/pci/htirq.c' failed with return code 2
