drm/sun4i: hdmi: Add missing rate halving check in sun4i_tmds_determine_rate

It was only checking the divider when determing the closest match if
it could not match the requested rate exactly.

For a projector connected to an Olimex A20-OLinuXino-LIME using HDMI
with a native resolution of 1280x800 and pixel clock of 83.5 MHz, this
resulted in 1280x800 mode not being available and the following in dmesg
when the kernel is booted with drm.debug=0x3e:
[drm:drm_mode_debug_printmodeline] Modeline 37:"1280x800" 60 83500 1280 1352 1480 1680 800 810 816 831 0x48 0x5
[drm:drm_mode_prune_invalid] Not using 1280x800 mode: NOCLOCK
