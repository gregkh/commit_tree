scsi: lpfc: Fix hard lock up NMI in els timeout handling.

System crashed due to a hard lockup at lpfc_els_timeout_handler+0x128.

The els ring's txcmplq list is corrupted: the last element in the list
does not point back the the head causing a loop. Issue is the els
processing path for sli4 hbas are using the hbalock instead of the
ring_lock for removing elements from the txcmplq list.

Use the adapter SLI_REV to determine which lock should be used for
removing iocbqs from the els rings txcmplq.

note: the future refactoring will address this so that we don't have
this ugly type-based lock code.
