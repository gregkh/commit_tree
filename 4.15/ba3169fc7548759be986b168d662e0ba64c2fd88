VSOCK: set POLLOUT | POLLWRNORM for TCP_CLOSING

select(2) with wfds but no rfds must return when the socket is shut down
by the peer.  This way userspace notices socket activity and gets -EPIPE
from the next write(2).

Currently select(2) does not return for virtio-vsock when a SEND+RCV
shutdown packet is received.  This is because vsock_poll() only sets
POLLOUT | POLLWRNORM for TCP_CLOSE, not the TCP_CLOSING state that the
socket is in when the shutdown is received.
