KVM: x86: Exit to user-mode on #UD intercept when emulator requires

Instruction emulation after trapping a #UD exception can result in an
MMIO access, for example when emulating a MOVBE on a processor that
doesn't support the instruction.  In this case, the #UD vmexit handler
must exit to user mode, but there wasn't any code to do so.  Add it for
both VMX and SVM.
