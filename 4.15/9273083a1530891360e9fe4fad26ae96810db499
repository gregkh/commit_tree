usb: dwc2: Fix TxFIFOn sizes and total TxFIFO size issues

In host mode reading from DPTXSIZn returning invalid value in
dwc2_check_param_tx_fifo_sizes function.

In total TxFIFO size calculations unnecessarily reducing by ep_info.
hw->total_fifo_size can be fully allocated for FIFO's.

Added num_dev_in_eps member in dwc2_hw_params structure to save number
of IN EPs.

Added g_tx_fifo_size array in dwc2_hw_params structure to store power
on reset values of DPTXSIZn registers in forced device mode.

Updated dwc2_hsotg_tx_fifo_count() function to get TxFIFO count from
num_dev_in_eps.

Updated dwc2_get_dev_hwparams() function to store DPTXFSIZn in
g_tx_fifo_size array.

dwc2_get_host/dev_hwparams() functions call moved after num_dev_in_eps
set from hwcfg4.

Modified dwc2_check_param_tx_fifo_sizes() function to check TxFIFOn
sizes based on g_tx_fifo_size array.

Removed ep_info subtraction during calculation of tx_addr_max in
dwc2_hsotg_tx_fifo_total_depth() function. Also removed
dwc2_hsotg_ep_info_size() function as no more need.
