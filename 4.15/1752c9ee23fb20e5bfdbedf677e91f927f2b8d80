clk: tegra: dfll: Fix drvdata overwriting issue

Both tegra124-dfll and clk-dfll are using platform_set_drvdata
to set drvdata of the exact same pdev while they use different
pointers for the drvdata. Once the drvdata has been overwritten
by tegra124-dfll, clk-dfll will never get its td pointer as it
expects.

Since tegra124-dfll merely needs its soc pointer in its remove
function, this patch fixes the bug by removing the overwriting
in the tegra124-dfll file and letting the tegra_dfll_unregister
return an soc pointer for it.
