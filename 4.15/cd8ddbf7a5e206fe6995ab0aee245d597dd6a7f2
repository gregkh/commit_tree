lightnvm: pblk: free padded entries in write buffer

When a REQ_FLUSH reaches pblk, the bio cannot be directly completed.
Instead, data on the write buffer is flushed and the bio is completed on
the completion pah. This might require some sectors to be padded in
order to guarantee a successful write.

This patch fixes a memory leak on the padded pages. A consequence of
this bad free was that internal bios not containing data (only a flush)
were not being completed.
