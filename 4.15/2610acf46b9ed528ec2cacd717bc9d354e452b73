dmaengine: fsl-edma: disable clks on all error paths

Previously enabled clks are only disabled if clk_prepare_enable() fails.
However, there are other error paths were the previously enabled
clocks are not disabled.

To fix the problem, fsl_disable_clocks() now takes the number of clocks
that shall be disabled + unprepared. For existing calls were all clocks
were already successfully prepared + enabled, DMAMUX_NR is passed to
disable + unprepare all clocks.

In error paths were only some clocks were successfully prepared +
enabled the loop counter is passed, in order to disable + unprepare
all successfully prepared + enabled clocks.
