tun: fix a memory leak for tfile->tx_array

tfile->tun could be detached before we close the tun fd,
via tun_detach_all(), so it should not be used to check for
tfile->tx_array.

As Jason suggested, we probably have to clean it up
unconditionally both in __tun_deatch() and tun_detach_all(),
but this requires to check if it is initialized or not.
Currently skb_array_cleanup() doesn't have such a check,
so I check it in the caller and introduce a helper function,
it is a bit ugly but we can always improve it in net-next.
