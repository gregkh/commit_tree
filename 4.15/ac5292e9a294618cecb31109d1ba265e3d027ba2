x86/boot: Fix boot failure when SMP MP-table is based at 0

When crosvm is used to boot a kernel as a VM, the SMP MP-table is found
at physical address 0x0. This causes mpf_base to be set to 0 and a
subsequent "if (!mpf_base)" check in default_get_smp_config() results in
the MP-table not being parsed.  Further into the boot this results in an
oops when attempting a read_apic_id().

Add a boolean variable that is set to true when the MP-table is found.
Use this variable for testing if the MP-table was found so that even a
value of 0 for mpf_base will result in continued parsing of the MP-table.
