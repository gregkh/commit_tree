drm/amd/display: make dc_commit_surfaces_to_stream() re-entrant

dc_commit_surfaces_to_stream() function currently
is handle's only one plane at a time.
This will not work if multiple planes have to be set to a crtc.

The functionality of dc_commit_surfaces_to_stream() with this patch
is slit into
1. Accumulate and initialise all the surfaces that needs to be
   set to a crtc.
2. Update the intialised set of surfaces to the steam in one go.

Hence dc_commit_surfaces_to_stream() is renamed to init_surfaces().
Once all the planes requested by user space are initialised,
dc_commit_surfaces_to_stream() shall sequentially populates *updates,
 *flip_addr, *plane_info and *scaling_info for all surfaces.

BUG: SWDEV-119421
TEST: (On Chromium OS for Stoney Only)
* Chromium UI comes up, on both eDP & DP.
* 'new_surface_count' now changes as per user input for e.g for
  all below run tests its 2, without this patch for the below
  tests it used to be 1
* Executed below tests to see YUV(underlay) & RGB planes on eDP
plane_test --format XR24 --size 500x100 -p --format YV12 --size 500x500
plane_test --format AR24 --size 500x50 -p --format YV12 --size 150x150
plane_test --format AR24 --size 500x50 -p --format YV12 --size 1366x768
