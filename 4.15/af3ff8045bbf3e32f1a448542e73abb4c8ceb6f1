crypto: hmac - require that the underlying hash algorithm is unkeyed

Because the HMAC template didn't check that its underlying hash
algorithm is unkeyed, trying to use "hmac(hmac(sha3-512-generic))"
through AF_ALG or through KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE resulted in the inner HMAC
being used without having been keyed, resulting in sha3_update() being
called without sha3_init(), causing a stack buffer overflow.

This is a very old bug, but it seems to have only started causing real
problems when SHA-3 support was added (requires CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA3)
because the innermost hash's state is ->import()ed from a zeroed buffer,
and it just so happens that other hash algorithms are fine with that,
but SHA-3 is not.  However, there could be arch or hardware-dependent
hash algorithms also affected; I couldn't test everything.

Fix the bug by introducing a function crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey()
which tests whether a shash algorithm is keyed.  Then update the HMAC
template to require that its underlying hash algorithm is unkeyed.

Here is a reproducer:

    #include <linux/if_alg.h>
    #include <sys/socket.h>

    int main()
    {
        int algfd;
        struct sockaddr_alg addr = {
            .salg_type = "hash",
            .salg_name = "hmac(hmac(sha3-512-generic))",
        };
        char key[4096] = { 0 };

        algfd = socket(AF_ALG, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);
        bind(algfd, (const struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr));
        setsockopt(algfd, SOL_ALG, ALG_SET_KEY, key, sizeof(key));
    }

Here was the KASAN report from syzbot:
