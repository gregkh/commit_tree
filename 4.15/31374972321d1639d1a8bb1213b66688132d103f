ACPI / PMIC: Add opregion driver for Intel Dollar Cove TI PMIC

This patch adds the opregion driver for Dollar Cove TI PMIC on Intel
Cherry Trail devices.  The patch is based on the original work by
Intel, found at:
      https://github.com/01org/ProductionKernelQuilts
with many cleanups and rewrites.

The driver is currently provided only as built-in to follow other
PMIC opregion drivers convention.

The re-enumeration of devices at probe is required for fixing the
issues on HP x2 210 G2.  See bug#195689.
