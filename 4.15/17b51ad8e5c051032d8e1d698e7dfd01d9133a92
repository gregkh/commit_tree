drm/i915: Only wake the waiter from the interrupt if passed

As we now check if the seqno is complete in order to signal the fence,
we can also decide not to wake up the first_waiter until it is ready
(since it is waiting on the same seqno). The only caveat is that if we
need the engine->irq_seqno_barrier to enforce some coherency between an
interrupt and the seqno read, we have to always wake the waiter in order
to perform that heavyweight barrier.
