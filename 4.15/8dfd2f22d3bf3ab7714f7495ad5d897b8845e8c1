509: fix printing uninitialized stack memory when OID is empty

Callers of sprint_oid() do not check its return value before printing
the result.  In the case where the OID is zero-length, -EBADMSG was
being returned without anything being written to the buffer, resulting
in uninitialized stack memory being printed.  Fix this by writing
"(bad)" to the buffer in the cases where -EBADMSG is returned.
