powerpc: Fix boot on BOOK3S_32 with CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX

On powerpc32, patch_instruction() is called by apply_feature_fixups()
which is called from early_init()

There is the following note in front of early_init():
 * Note that the kernel may be running at an address which is different
 * from the address that it was linked at, so we must use RELOC/PTRRELOC
 * to access static data (including strings).  -- paulus

Therefore, slab_is_available() cannot be called yet, and
text_poke_area must be addressed with PTRRELOC()
