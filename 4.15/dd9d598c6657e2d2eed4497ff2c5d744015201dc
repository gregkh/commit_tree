ip_gre: add the support for i/o_flags update via netlink

Now ip_gre is using ip_tunnel_changelink to update it's properties, but
ip_tunnel_changelink in ip_tunnel doesn't update i/o_flags as a common
function.

o_flags updates would cause that tunnel->tun_hlen / hlen and dev->mtu /
needed_headroom need to be recalculated, and dev->(hw_)features need to
be updated as well.

Therefore, we can't just add the update into ip_tunnel_update called
in ip_tunnel_changelink, and it's also better not to touch ip_tunnel
codes.

This patch updates i/o_flags and calls ipgre_link_update to recalculate
these gre properties after ip_tunnel_changelink does the common update.

Note that since ipgre_link_update doesn't know the lower dev, it will
update gre->hlen, dev->mtu and dev->needed_headroom with the value of
'new tun_hlen - old tun_hlen'. In this way, we can avoid many redundant
codes, unlike ip6_gre.
