PCI: iproc: Allow allocation of multiple MSIs

Add support for allocating multiple MSIs at the same time, so that the
MSI_FLAG_MULTI_PCI_MSI flag can be added to the msi_domain_info structure.

Avoid storing the hwirq in the low 5 bits of the message data, as it is
used by the device. Also fix an endianness problem by using readl().
