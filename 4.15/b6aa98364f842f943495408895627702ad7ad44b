PM / OPP: Add dev_pm_opp_{un}register_get_pstate_helper()

This adds the dev_pm_opp_{un}register_get_pstate_helper() helper
routines which will be used to set the get_pstate() callback for a
device. This callback will be later called internally by the OPP core to
get performance state corresponding to an OPP.

This is required temporarily until the time we have proper DT bindings
to include the performance state information.
