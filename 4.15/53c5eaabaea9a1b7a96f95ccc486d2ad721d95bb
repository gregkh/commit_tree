ACPI / EC: Fix regression related to triggering source of EC event handling

Originally the Samsung quirks removed by commit 4c237371 can be covered
by commit e923e8e7 and ec_freeze_events=Y mode. But commit 9c40f956
changed ec_freeze_events=Y back to N, making this problem re-surface.

Actually, if commit e923e8e7 is robust enough, we can freely change
ec_freeze_events mode, so this patch fixes the issue by improving
commit e923e8e7.

 Subject: Revert "ACPI / EC: Enable event freeze mode..." to fix
          a regression

This patch not only fixes the reported post-resume EC event triggering
source issue, but also fixes an unreported similar issue related to the
driver bind by adding EC event triggering source in ec_install_handlers().
