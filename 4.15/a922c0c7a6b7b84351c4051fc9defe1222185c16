drm/i915/guc: Don't make assumptions while getting the lrca offset

Using the HWSP ggtt_offset to get the lrca offset is only correct if the
HWSP happens to be before it (when we reuse the PPHWSP of the kernel
context as the engine HWSP). Instead of making this assumption, get the
lrca offset from the kernel_context engine state.

And while looking at this part of the GuC interaction, it was also
noticed that the firmware expects the size of only the engine context
(context minus the execlist part, i.e. don't include the first 80
dwords), so pass the right size.

v2: Use the new macros to prevent abusive overuse of the old ones (Chris).
