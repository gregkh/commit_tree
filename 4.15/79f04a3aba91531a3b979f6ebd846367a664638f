i40e: convert i40e_get_settings_link_up to new API

This removes references to old ethtool API macros and functions in
i40e_get_settings_link_up as part of the process of converting to the
new API.  The new API also allows us to provide more explicit support
for new 25G and 10G PHY types so some of the PHY types have been
adjusted where necessary as well.
