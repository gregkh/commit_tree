perf callchain: Create real callchain entries for inlined frames

The inline_node structs are maintained by the new dso->inlines tree.
This in turn keeps ownership of the fake symbols and srcline string
representing an inline frame.

This tree is sorted by address to allow quick lookups. All other entries
of the symbol beside the function name are unused for inline frames. The
advantage of this approach is that all existing users of the callchain
API can now transparently display inlined frames without having to patch
their code.
