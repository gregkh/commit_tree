ASoC: qcom: remove duplicate initializations of dma_ch and v

dma_ch is being initialized to zero and then immediately afterwards
being updated again, so the first initialization is redundant and
can be remove.

Likewise, the pointer v is being initialized twice, so remove the second
duplicate initialization.

Cleans up two clang build warnings:
warning: Value stored to 'dma_ch' is never read
warning: Value stored to 'v' during its initialization is never read
