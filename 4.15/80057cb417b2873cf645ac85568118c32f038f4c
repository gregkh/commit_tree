gpio-mmio: Use the new .get_multiple() callback

It is possible to read all lines of a generic MMIO GPIO chip
with a single register read so support this if we are in
native endianness.

Add an especially quirky callback to read multiple lines for
the variants that require you to read values from the
output registers if and only if the line is set as output.
We managed to do that with a maximum of two register reads,
and just one read if the requested lines are all input or all
output.
