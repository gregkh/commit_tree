hwmon: (k10temp) Add support for temperature offsets

Add support for handling temperature offset values for various AMD CPUs,
similar to the code used in the coretemp driver for Intel CPUs. This is
primarily for Ryzen CPUs (which has documented temperature offsets),
but the code is kept generic to simplify adding additional CPUs.
