loop: fix concurrent lo_open/lo_release

范龙飞 reports that KASAN can report a use-after-free in __lock_acquire.
The reason is due to insufficient serialization in lo_release(), which
will continue to use the loop device even after it has decremented the
lo_refcnt to zero.

In the meantime, another process can come in, open the loop device
again as it is being shut down. Confusion ensues.
