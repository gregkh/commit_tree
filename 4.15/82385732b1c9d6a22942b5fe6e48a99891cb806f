ARC: perf: avoid vmalloc backed mmap

For non-alising Dcache, vmalloc is not needed.

vmalloc triggers additonal D-TLB Misses in the perf interrupt code path
making it slightly inefficient as evident from hackbench runs below.

| [ARCLinux]# perf stat -e dTLB-load-misses --repeat 5 hackbench
| Running with 10*40 (== 400) tasks.
| Time: 35.060

| Performance counter stats for 'hackbench' (5 runs):

Before:      399235      dTLB-load-misses ( +-  2.08% )
After :      397676      dTLB-load-misses ( +-  2.27% )
