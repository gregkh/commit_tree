i40e: fix flags declaration

Since we don't yet have more than 32 flags, we'll use a u32 for both the
hw_features and flag field. Should we gain more flags in the future, we
may need to convert to a u64 or separate flags out into two fields.

This was overlooked in the previous commit 2781de2134c4 ("i40e/i40evf:
organize and re-number feature flags"), where the feature flag was not
converted form u64 to u32.
