fou: fix some member types in guehdr

guehdr struct is used to build or parse gue packets, which
are always in big endian. It's better to define all guehdr
members as __beXX types.

Also, in validate_gue_flags it's not good to use a __be32
variable for both Standard flags(__be16) and Private flags
(__be32), and pass it to other funcions.

This patch could fix a bunch of sparse warnings from fou.
