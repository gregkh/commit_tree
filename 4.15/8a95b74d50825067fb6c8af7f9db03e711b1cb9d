x86: Mark hpa as a "Designated Reviewer" for the time being

Due to some unfortunate events, I have not been directly involved in
the x86 kernel patch flow for a while now.  I have also not been able
to ramp back up by now like I had hoped to, and after reviewing what I
will need to work on both internally at Intel and elsewhere in the near
term, it is clear that I am not going to be able to ramp back up until
late 2018 at the very earliest.

It is not acceptable to not recognize that this load is currently
taken by Ingo and Thomas without my direct participation, so I mark
myself as R: (designated reviewer) rather than M: (maintainer) until
further notice.  This is in fact recognizing the de facto situation
for the past few years.

I have obviously no intention of going away, and I will do everything
within my power to improve Linux on x86 and x86 for Linux.  This,
however, puts credit where it is due and reflects a change of focus.

This patch also removes stale entries for portions of the x86
architecture which have not been maintained separately from arch/x86
for a long time.  If there is a reason to re-introduce them then that
can happen later.
