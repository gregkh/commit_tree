net: openvswitch: datapath: fix data type in queue_gso_packets

gso_type is being used in binary AND operations together with SKB_GSO_UDP.
The issue is that variable gso_type is of type unsigned short and
SKB_GSO_UDP expands to more than 16 bits:

SKB_GSO_UDP = 1 << 16

this makes any binary AND operation between gso_type and SKB_GSO_UDP to
be always zero, hence making some code unreachable and likely causing
undesired behavior.

Fix this by changing the data type of variable gso_type to unsigned int.
