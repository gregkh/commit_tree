Btrfs: disable FUA if mounted with nobarrier

I was seeing disk flushes still happening when I mounted a Btrfs
filesystem with nobarrier for testing. This is because we use FUA to
write out the first super block, and on devices without FUA support, the
block layer translates FUA to a flush. Even on devices supporting true
FUA, using FUA when we asked for no barriers is surprising.
