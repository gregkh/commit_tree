s390/sthyi: add cache to store hypervisor info

STHYI requires extensive locking in the higher hypervisors and is
very computational/memory expensive. Therefore we cache the retrieved
hypervisor info whose valid period is 1s with mutex to allow concurrent
access. rw semaphore can't benefit here due to cache line bounce.
