mac80211_hwsim: Fix a possible sleep-in-atomic bug in hwsim_get_radio_nl

The driver may sleep under a spinlock.
The function call path is:
hwsim_get_radio_nl (acquire the spinlock)
  nlmsg_new(GFP_KERNEL) --> may sleep

To fix it, GFP_KERNEL is replaced with GFP_ATOMIC.

This bug is found by my static analysis tool(DSAC) and checked by my code review.
