RDMA/hns: Split hw v1 driver from hns roce driver

The hardware relevant definitions and operations are implemented
in hns_roce_hw_v* file. According to the diversity chips, the file
is named as hns_roce_hw_v1.c or hns_roce_hw_v2.c etc.

The general software process flow, common structures and allocated
algorithms are implemented in other files located in hns roce driver.

In order to support the scalability of the hardware version, the
common driver features are in the hns-roce.ko, and the hardware
relevant operations are in hns_roce_hw_v1.ko or hns_roce_hw_v2.ko
based on the series chips.
