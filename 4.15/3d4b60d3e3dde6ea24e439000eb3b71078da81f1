sched/fair: Cure calc_cfs_shares() vs. reweight_entity()

Vincent reported that when running in a cgroup, his root
cfs_rq->avg.load_avg dropped to 0 on task idle.

This is because reweight_entity() will now immediately propagate the
weight change of the group entity to its cfs_rq, and as it happens,
our approxmation (5) for calc_cfs_shares() results in 0 when the group
is idle.

Avoid this by using the correct (3) as a lower bound on (5). This way
the empty cgroup will slowly decay instead of instantly drop to 0.
