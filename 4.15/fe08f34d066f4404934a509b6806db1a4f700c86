ALSA: pcm: Remove incorrect snd_BUG_ON() usages

syzkaller triggered kernel warnings through PCM OSS emulation at

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 3502 at sound/core/pcm_lib.c:1635

This happens while it tries to open and set up the aloop device
concurrently.  The warning above (invoked from snd_BUG_ON() macro) is
to detect the unexpected logical error where snd_pcm_hw_refine() call
shouldn't fail.  The theory is true for the case where the hw_params
config rules are static.  But for an aloop device, the hw_params rule
condition does vary dynamically depending on the connected target;
when another device is opened and changes the parameters, the device
connected in another side is also affected, and it caused the error
from snd_pcm_hw_refine().

That is, the simplest "solution" for this is to remove the incorrect
assumption of static rules, and treat such an error as a normal error
path.  As there are a couple of other places using snd_BUG_ON()
incorrectly, this patch removes these spurious snd_BUG_ON() calls.
