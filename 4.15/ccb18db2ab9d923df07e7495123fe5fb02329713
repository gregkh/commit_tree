x86/fpu: Make XSAVE check the base CPUID features before enabling

Before enabling XSAVE, not only check the XSAVE specific CPUID bits,
but also the base CPUID features of the respective XSAVE feature.
This allows to disable individual XSAVE states using the existing
clearcpuid= option, which can be useful for performance testing
and debugging, and also in general avoids inconsistencies.
