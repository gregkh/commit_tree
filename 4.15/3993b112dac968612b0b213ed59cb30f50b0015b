btrfs: avoid null pointer dereference on fs_info when calling btrfs_crit

There are checks on fs_info in __btrfs_panic to avoid dereferencing a
null fs_info, however, there is a call to btrfs_crit that may also
dereference a null fs_info. Fix this by adding a check to see if fs_info
is null and only print the s_id if fs_info is non-null.
