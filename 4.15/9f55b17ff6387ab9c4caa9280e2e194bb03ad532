clk: renesas: rcar-gen3: Restore SDHI clocks during resume

On R-Car Gen3 systems, PSCI system suspend powers down the SoC, losing
clock configuration.  Register a notifier to save/restore SDHI clock
registers during system suspend/resume.

This is implemented using the cpg_simple_notifier abstraction, which can
be reused for others clocks that just need to save/restore a single
register.
