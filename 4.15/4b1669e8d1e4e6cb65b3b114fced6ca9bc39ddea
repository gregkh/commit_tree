x86/apic: Prepare for unifying the interrupt delivery modes setup

There are three places which initialize the interrupt delivery modes:

1) init_bsp_APIC() which is called early might setup the through-local-APIC
   virtual wire mode on non SMP systems.

2) In an SMP-capable system, native_smp_prepare_cpus() tries to switch to
   symmetric I/O model.

3) In UP system with UP_LATE_INIT=y, the local APIC and I/O APIC are set up
   in smp_init().

There is no technical reason to make these initializations at random places
and run the kernel with the potentially wrong mode through the early boot
stage, but it has a problematic side effect: The late switch to symmetric
I/O mode causes dump-capture kernel to hang when the kernel command line
option 'notsc' is active.

Provide a new function to unify that three positions. Preparatory patch to
initialize an interrupt mode directly.
