Btrfs: remove bio_flags which indicates a meta block of log-tree

Since both committing transaction and writing log-tree are doing
plugging on metadata IO, we can unify to use %sync_writers to benefit
both cases, instead of checking bio_flags while writing meta blocks of
log-tree.

We can remove this bio_flags because in order to write dirty blocks,
log tree also uses btrfs_write_marked_extents(), inside which we
have enabled %sync_writers, therefore, every write goes in a
synchronous way, so does checksuming.

Please also note that, bio_flags is applied per-context while
%sync_writers is applied per-inode, so this might incur some overhead, ie.

1) while log tree is flushing its dirty blocks via
   btrfs_write_marked_extents(), in which %sync_writers is increased
   by one.

2) in the meantime, some writeback operations may happen upon btrfs's
   metadata inode, so these writes go synchronously, too.

However, AFAICS, the overhead is not a big one while the win is that
we unify the two places that needs synchronous way and remove a
special hack/flag.

This removes the bio_flags related stuff for writing log-tree.
