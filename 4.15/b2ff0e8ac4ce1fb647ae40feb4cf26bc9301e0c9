drm/amdgpu: add framework for HW specific priority settings v9

Add an initial framework for changing the HW priorities of rings. The
framework allows requesting priority changes for the lifetime of an
amdgpu_job. After the job completes the priority will decay to the next
lowest priority for which a request is still valid.

A new ring function set_priority() can now be populated to take care of
the HW specific programming sequence for priority changes.

v2: set priority before emitting IB, and take a ref on amdgpu_job
v3: use AMD_SCHED_PRIORITY_* instead of AMDGPU_CTX_PRIORITY_*
v4: plug amdgpu_ring_restore_priority_cb into amdgpu_job_free_cb
v5: use atomic for tracking job priorities instead of last_job
v6: rename amdgpu_ring_priority_[get/put]() and align parameters
v7: replace spinlocks with mutexes for KIQ compatibility
v8: raise ring priority during cs_ioctl, instead of job_run
v9: priority_get() before push_job()
