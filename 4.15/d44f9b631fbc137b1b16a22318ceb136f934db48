net: hns3: Cleanup for struct that used to send cmd to firmware

The hclge_tm module has already added _cmd to the end of struct
that used to send cmd to firmware. This will help us finding the
endian issues.
This patch adds the _cmd to the end of struct that used to send
cmd to firmware in hclge_main module.
