afs: Fix some dentry handling in dir ops and missing key_puts

Fix some of dentry handling in AFS directory ops:

 (1) Do d_drop() on the new_dentry before assigning a new inode to it in
     afs_vnode_new_inode().  It's fine to do this before calling afs_iget()
     because the operation has taken place on the server.

 (2) Replace d_instantiate()/d_rehash() with d_add().

 (3) Don't d_drop() the new_dentry in afs_rename() on error.

Also fix afs_link() and afs_rename() to call key_put() on all error paths
where the key is taken.
