net/tls: Fix inverted error codes to avoid endless loop

sendfile() calls can hang endless with using Kernel TLS if a socket error occurs.
Socket error codes must be inverted by Kernel TLS before returning because
they are stored with positive sign. If returned non-inverted they are
interpreted as number of bytes sent, causing endless looping of the
splice mechanic behind sendfile().
