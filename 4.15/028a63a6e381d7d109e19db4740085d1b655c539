f2fs: simplify page iteration loops

In several places we want to iterate over all tagged pages in a mapping.
However the code was apparently copied from places that iterate only
over a limited range and thus it checks for index <= end, optimizes the
case where we are coming close to range end which is all pointless when
end == ULONG_MAX.  So just remove this dead code.
