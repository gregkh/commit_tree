bpf, ixgbe: add meta data support

Implement support for transferring XDP meta data into skb for
ixgbe driver; before calling into the program, xdp.data_meta points
to xdp.data, where on program return with pass verdict, we call
into skb_metadata_set().

We implement this for the default ixgbe_build_skb() variant. For the
ixgbe_construct_skb() that is used when legacy-rx buffer mananagement
mode is turned on via ethtool, I found that XDP gets 0 headroom, so
neither xdp_adjust_head() nor xdp_adjust_meta() can be used with this.
Just add a comment with explanation for this operating mode.
