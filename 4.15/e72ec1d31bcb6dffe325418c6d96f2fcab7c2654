lightnvm: pblk: do not use a mempool for line bitmaps

pblk holds two sector bitmaps: one to keep track of the mapped sectors
while the line is active and another one to keep track of the invalid
sectors. The latter is kept during the whole live of the line, until it
is recycled. Since we cannot guarantee forward progress for the mempool
in this case, get rid of the mempool and simply allocate memory through
kmalloc.
