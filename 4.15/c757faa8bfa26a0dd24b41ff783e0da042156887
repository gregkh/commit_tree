ipv6: prepare fib6_age() for exception table

If all dst cache entries are stored in the exception table under the
main route, we have to go through them during fib6_age() when doing
garbage collecting.
Introduce a new function rt6_age_exception() which goes through all dst
entries in the exception table and remove those entries that are expired.
This function is called in fib6_age() so that all dst caches are also
garbage collected.
