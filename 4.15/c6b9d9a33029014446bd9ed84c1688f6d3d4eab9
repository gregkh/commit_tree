sched/wait: Fix add_wait_queue() behavioral change

The following cleanup commit:

  50816c48997a ("sched/wait: Standardize internal naming of wait-queue entries")

... unintentionally changed the behavior of add_wait_queue() from
inserting the wait entry at the head of the wait queue to the tail
of the wait queue.

Beyond a negative performance impact this change in behavior
theoretically also breaks wait queues which mix exclusive and
non-exclusive waiters, as non-exclusive waiters will not be
woken up if they are queued behind enough exclusive waiters.
