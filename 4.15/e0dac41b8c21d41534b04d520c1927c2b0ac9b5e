ASoC: soc-core: add snd_soc_add_component()

ALSA SoC platform/codec will be replaced to component soon.
But, some function exist in "platform" doesn't exist in "component".
Current soc-core has snd_soc_register_component(), but
doesn't have snd_soc_add_component() like snd_soc_add_platform().
This patch adds it.
