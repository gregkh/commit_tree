crypto: keywrap - simplify code

The code is simplified by using two __be64 values for the operation
instead of using two arrays of u8. This allows to get rid of the memory
alignment code. In addition, the crypto_xor can be replaced with a
native XOR operation. Finally, the definition of the variables is
re-arranged such that the data structures come before simple variables
to potentially reduce memory space.
