staging: fbtft: fb_ssd1331: fix mirrored display

When the row scan order is reversed (the default) we also need to
reverse the column scan order. This was not done previously, resulting
in a mirrored display.

Also add support for 180 degree display rotation, in which case simply
disable reversed row and column scan order.

Tested on an Adafruit 0.96" mini Color OLED display.
