drm/i915/cnl: WaForceContextSaveRestoreNonCoherent

To avoid a potential hang condition with TLB invalidation
we need to enable masked bit 5 of MMIO 0xE5F0 at boot.

Same workaround was in place for previous platforms,
but the register offset has changed for CNL.
But also BSpec doesn't mention the bit 15 as set on gen9
platforms and mark bit as reserved on CNL.

v2: Improve commit message accepting Oscar's suggestion.
