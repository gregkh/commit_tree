perf/ftrace: Fix function trace events

The function-trace <-> perf interface is a tad messed up. Where all
the other trace <-> perf interfaces use a single trace hook
registration and use per-cpu RCU based hlist to iterate the events,
function-trace actually needs multiple hook registrations in order to
minimize function entry patching when filters are present.

The end result is that we iterate events both on the trace hook and on
the hlist, which results in reporting events multiple times.

Since function-trace cannot use the regular scheme, fix it the other
way around, use singleton hlists.
