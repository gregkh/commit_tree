netfilter: x_tables: don't use seqlock when fetching old counters

after previous commit xt_replace_table will wait until all cpus
had even seqcount (i.e., no cpu is accessing old ruleset).

Add a 'old' counter retrival version that doesn't synchronize counters.
Its not needed, the old counters are not in use anymore at this point.

This speeds up table replacement on busy systems with large tables
(and many cores).
