drm/i915: Drop debugfs/i915_gem_pin_display

It has now lost its meaning (it shows more than just pin_display), I do
not believe that we are using in preference to the complete listing from
i915_gem_gtt, or the listing from i915_gem_framebuffer, or the listing
of active display objects in i915_display_info.
