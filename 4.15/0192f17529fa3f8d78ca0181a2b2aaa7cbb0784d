clean up x86 platform driver default values

The updates this merge window added several bogus default enablement for
new features.  We don't do that.  If people want new behavior, they ask
for it.

One 'default n' was also removed as pointless.  That's great, but there
were eight other ones in the same file that were left alone.

Fix it up.
