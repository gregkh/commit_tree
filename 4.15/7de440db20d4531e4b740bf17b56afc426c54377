drm: Check mode object lease status in all master ioctl paths [v4]

Attempts to modify un-leased objects are rejected with an error.
Information returned about unleased objects is modified to make them
appear unusable and/or disconnected.

Changes for v2 as suggested by Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>:

 * With the change in the __drm_mode_object_find API to pass the
   file_priv along, we can now centralize most of the lease-based
   access checks in that function.

 * A few places skip that API and require in-line checks.

Changes for v3 provided by Dave Airlie <airlied@redhat.com>

 * remove support for leasing encoders.
 * add support for leasing planes.

Changes for v4

 * Only call drm_lease_held if DRIVER_MODESET.
