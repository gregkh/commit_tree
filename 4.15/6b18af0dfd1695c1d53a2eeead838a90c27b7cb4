xfs: remove XFS_BMAP_MAX_SHIFT_EXTENTS

The define was always set to 1, which means looping until we reach is
was dead code from the start.

Also remove an initialization of next_fsb for the done case that doesn't
fit the new code flow - it was never checked by the caller in the done
case to start with.
