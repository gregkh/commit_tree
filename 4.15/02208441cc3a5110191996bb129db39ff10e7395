drm/amdgpu: Add PASID management

Allows assigning a PASID to a VM for identifying VMs involved in page
faults. The global PASID manager is also exported in the KFD
interface so that AMDGPU and KFD can share the PASID space.

PASIDs of different sizes can be requested. On APUs, the PASID size
is deterined by the capabilities of the IOMMU. So KFD must be able
to allocate PASIDs in a smaller range.
