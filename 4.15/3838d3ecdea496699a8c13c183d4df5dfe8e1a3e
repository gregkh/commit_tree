afs: Allow IPv6 address specification of VL servers

Allow VL server specifications to be given IPv6 addresses as well as IPv4
addresses, for example as:

	echo add foo.org 1111:2222:3333:0:4444:5555:6666:7777 >/proc/fs/afs/cells

Note that ':' is the expected separator for separating IPv4 addresses, but
if a ',' is detected or no '.' is detected in the string, the delimiter is
switched to ','.

This also works with DNS AFSDB or SRV record strings fetched by upcall from
userspace.
