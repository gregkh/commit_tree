KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-its: New helper functions to free the caches

We create two new functions that free the device and
collection lists. They are currently called by vgic_its_destroy()
and other callers will be added in subsequent patches.

We also remove the check on its->device_list.next.
Lists are initialized in vgic_create_its() and the device
is added to the device list only if this latter succeeds.

vgic_its_destroy is the device destroy ops. This latter is called
by kvm_destroy_devices() which loops on all created devices. So
at this point the list is initialized.
