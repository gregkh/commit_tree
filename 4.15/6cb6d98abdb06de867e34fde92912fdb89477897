HID: hid-logitech: remove redundant assignment to pointer value

The pointer value is being assigned a value and this is never read, and later
on it is being assigned a new value.  This the first assignment is redundant
and can be removed and hence also the variables report and report_list.  Cleans
up the clang warning: Value stored to 'value' during its initialization is
never read
