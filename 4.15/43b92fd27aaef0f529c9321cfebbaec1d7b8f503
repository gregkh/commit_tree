nvmet-rdma: update queue list during ib_device removal

A NULL deref happens when nvmet_rdma_remove_one() is called more than once
(e.g. while connected via 2 ports).
The first call frees the queues related to the first ib_device but
doesn't remove them from the queue list.
While calling nvmet_rdma_remove_one() for the second ib_device it goes over
the full queue list again and we get the NULL deref.

Fixes: f1d4ef7d ("nvmet-rdma: register ib_client to not deadlock in device removal")
