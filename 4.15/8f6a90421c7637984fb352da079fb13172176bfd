cxl: Rename register PSL9_FIR2 to PSL9_FIR_MASK

PSL9 doesn't have a FIR2 register as was the case with PSL8. However
currently the register definitions in 'cxl.h' have a definition for
PSL9_FIR2 that actually points to PSL9_FIR_MASK register in the P1
area at offset 0x308.

So this patch renames the def PSL9_FIR2 to PSL9_FIR_MASK and updates
the references in the code to point to the new identifier. It also
removes the code to dump contents of FIR2 (FIR_MASK actually) in
cxl_native_irq_dump_regs_psl9().
