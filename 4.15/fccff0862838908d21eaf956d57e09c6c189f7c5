mlxsw: spectrum: Disable MAC learning for ovs port

Learning is currently enabled for ports which are OVS slaves -
even though OVS doesn't need this indication.
Since we're not associating a fid with the port, HW would continuously
notify driver of learned [& aged] MACs which would be logged as errors.
