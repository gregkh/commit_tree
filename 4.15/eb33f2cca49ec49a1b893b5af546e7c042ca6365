bpf: remove explicit handling of 0 for arg2 in bpf_probe_read

Commit 9c019e2bc4b2 ("bpf: change helper bpf_probe_read arg2 type to
ARG_CONST_SIZE_OR_ZERO") changed arg2 type to ARG_CONST_SIZE_OR_ZERO to
simplify writing bpf programs by taking advantage of the new semantics
introduced for ARG_CONST_SIZE_OR_ZERO which allows <!NULL, 0> arguments.

In order to prevent the helper from actually passing a NULL pointer to
probe_kernel_read, which can happen when <NULL, 0> is passed to the helper,
the commit also introduced an explicit check against size == 0.

After the recent introduction of the ARG_PTR_TO_MEM_OR_NULL type,
bpf_probe_read can not receive a pair of <NULL, 0> arguments anymore, thus
the check is not needed anymore and can be removed, since probe_kernel_read
can correctly handle a <!NULL, 0> call. This also fixes the semantics of
the helper before it gets officially released and bpf programs start
relying on this check.
