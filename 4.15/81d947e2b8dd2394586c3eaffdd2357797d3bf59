net, sched: fix panic when updating miniq {b,q}stats

While working on fixing another bug, I ran into the following panic
on arm64 by simply attaching clsact qdisc, adding a filter and running
traffic on ingress to it:

Reason is that sch_ingress and sch_clsact are doing mini_qdisc_pair_init()
which sets up miniq pointers to cpu_{b,q}stats from the underlying qdisc.
Problem is that this cannot work since they are actually set up right after
the qdisc ->init() callback in qdisc_create(), so first packet going into
sch_handle_ingress() tries to call mini_qdisc_bstats_cpu_update() and we
therefore panic.

In order to fix this, allocation of {b,q}stats needs to happen before we
call into ->init(). In net-next, there's already such option through commit
d59f5ffa59d8 ("net: sched: a dflt qdisc may be used with per cpu stats").
However, the bug needs to be fixed in net still for 4.15. Thus, include
these bits to reduce any merge churn and reuse the static_flags field to
set TCQ_F_CPUSTATS, and remove the allocation from qdisc_create() since
there is no other user left. Prashant Bhole ran into the same issue but
for net-next, thus adding him below as well as co-author. Same issue was
also reported by Sandipan Das when using bcc.

Fixes: 46209401f8f6 ("net: core: introduce mini_Qdisc and eliminate usage of tp->q for clsact fastpath")
