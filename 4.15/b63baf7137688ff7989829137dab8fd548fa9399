staging: fsl-dpaa2/eth: Check SGT final bit is present

For scatter-gather ingress frames, we expect to receive
a list of fragments from the hardware, last of which is
marked with a "final" bit.

Add a check to make sure the Rx frame has this bit set
correctly; there's not much we can do in case of a
malformed frame, but at least issue a warning.
