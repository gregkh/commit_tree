RISC-V: Resurrect smp_mb__after_spinlock()

I removed this last week because of an incorrect comment:
smp_mb__after_spinlock() is actually still used, and is necessary on
RISC-V.  It's been resurrected, with a comment that describes what it
actually does this time.  Thanks to Andrea for finding the bug!
