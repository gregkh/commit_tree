RISC-V: Device, timer, IRQs, and the SBI

This patch contains code that interfaces with devices that are mandated
by the RISC-V supervisor specification and that don't have explicit
drivers anywhere else in the tree.  This includes the staticly defined
interrupts, the CSR-mapped timer, and virtualized SBI devices.
