drm/msm: Move memptrs to msm_gpu

When we move to multiple ringbuffers we're going to store the data
in the memptrs on a per-ring basis. In order to prepare for that
move the current memptrs from the adreno namespace into msm_gpu.
This is way cleaner and immediately lets us kill off some sub
functions so there is much less cost later when we do move to
per-ring structs.
