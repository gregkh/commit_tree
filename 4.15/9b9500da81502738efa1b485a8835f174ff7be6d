rcu: Make RCU CPU stall warnings check for irq-disabled CPUs

One common question upon seeing an RCU CPU stall warning is "did
the stalled CPUs have interrupts disabled?"  However, the current
stall warnings are silent on this point.  This commit therefore
uses irq_work to check whether stalled CPUs still respond to IPIs,
and flags this state in the RCU CPU stall warning console messages.
