ovl: don't follow redirects if redirect_dir=off

Overlayfs is following redirects even when redirects are disabled. If this
is unintentional (probably the majority of cases) then this can be a
problem.  E.g. upper layer comes from untrusted USB drive, and attacker
crafts a redirect to enable read access to otherwise unreadable
directories.

If "redirect_dir=off", then turn off following as well as creation of
redirects.  If "redirect_dir=follow", then turn on following, but turn off
creation of redirects (which is what "redirect_dir=off" does now).

This is a backward incompatible change, so make it dependent on a config
option.
