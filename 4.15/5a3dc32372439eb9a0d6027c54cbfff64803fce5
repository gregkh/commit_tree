IB/cm: Fix memory corruption in handling CM request

In recent code, two path record entries are alwasy cleared while
allocated could be either one or two path record entries.
This leads to zero out of unallocated memory.

This fix initializes alternative path record only when alternative path
is set.

While we are at it, path record allocation doesn't check for OPA
alternative path, but rest of the code checks for OPA alternative path.
Path record allocation code doesn't check for OPA alternative LID.
This can further lead to memory corruption when only one path record is
allocated, but there is actually alternative OPA path record present in CM
request.
