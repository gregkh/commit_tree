block: unalign call_single_data in struct request

A previous change blindly added massive alignment to the
call_single_data structure in struct request. This ballooned it in size
from 296 to 320 bytes on my setup, for no valid reason at all.

Use the unaligned struct __call_single_data variant instead.
