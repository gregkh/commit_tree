Revert "mm/page-writeback.c: print a warning if the vm dirtiness settings are illogical"

This reverts commit 0f6d24f87856 ("mm/page-writeback.c: print a warning
if the vm dirtiness settings are illogical") because it causes false
positive warnings during OOM situations as noticed by Tetsuo Handa:

  vm direct limit must be set greater than background limit.

The problem is that both thresh and bg_thresh will be 0 if
available_memory is less than 4 pages when evaluating
global_dirtyable_memory.

While this might be worked around the whole point of the warning is
dubious at best.  We do rely on admins to do sensible things when
changing tunable knobs.  Dirty memory writeback knobs are not any
special in that regards so revert the warning rather than adding more
hacks to work this around.
