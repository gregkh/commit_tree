driver core: Move device_links_purge() after bus_remove_device()

The current ordering of code in device_del() triggers a WARN_ON()
in device_links_purge(), because of an unexpected link status.

The device_links_unbind_consumers() call in device_release_driver()
has to take place before device_links_purge() for the status of all
links to be correct, so move the device_links_purge() call in
device_del() after the invocation of bus_remove_device() which calls
device_release_driver().
