btrfs: send: remove unused code

This code was first introduced in 31db9f7c23fb ("Btrfs: introduce
BTRFS_IOC_SEND for btrfs send/receive") and it was not functional, then
it got slightly refactored in e938c8ad543c ("Btrfs: code cleanups for
send/receive"), alas it was still dead. So let's remove it for good!
