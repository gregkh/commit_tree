tracing: Exclude 'generic fields' from histograms

There are a small number of 'generic fields' (comm/COMM/cpu/CPU) that
are found by trace_find_event_field() but are only meant for
filtering.  Specifically, they unlike normal fields, they have a size
of 0 and thus wreak havoc when used as a histogram key.

Exclude these (return -EINVAL) when used as histogram keys.
