sched/fair: Remove se->load.weight from se->avg.load_sum

Remove the load from the load_sum for sched_entities, basically
turning load_sum into runnable_sum.  This prepares for better
reweighting of group entities.

Since we now have different rules for computing load_avg, split
___update_load_avg() into two parts, ___update_load_sum() and
___update_load_avg().

So for se:

  ___update_load_sum(.weight = 1)
  ___upate_load_avg(.weight = se->load.weight)

and for cfs_rq:

  ___update_load_sum(.weight = cfs_rq->load.weight)
  ___upate_load_avg(.weight = 1)

Since the primary consumable is load_avg, most things will not be
affected. Only those few sites that initialize/modify load_sum need
attention.
