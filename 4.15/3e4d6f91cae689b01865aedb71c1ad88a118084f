RDMA/cxgb3: remove redundant first assignement of sqp

sqp is being initialised when it is being declared and then updated
a little later on making the first initialization redundant. Clean
this up by initializing ptr and sqp at their declaration.

Cleans up warning: "warning: Value stored to 'sqp' during its
initialization is never read"
