drm/i915: Always sanity check engine state upon idling

When we do a locked idle we know that afterwards all requests have been
completed and the engines have been cleared of tasks. For whatever
reason, this doesn't always happen and we may go into a suspend with
ELSP still full, and this causes an issue upon resume as we get very,
very confused.

If the engines refuse to idle, mark the device as wedged. In the process
we get rid of the maybe unused open-coded version of wait_for_engines
reported by Nick Desaulniers and Matthias Kaehlcke.

v2: Suppress the -EIO before suspend, but keep it for seqno wrap.
