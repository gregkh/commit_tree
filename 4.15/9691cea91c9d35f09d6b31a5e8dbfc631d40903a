net: seeq: fix timer conversion

One of the timer conversion patches evidently escaped build testing
until I ran into in on ARM randconfig builds:

drivers/net/ethernet/seeq/ether3.c: In function 'ether3_ledoff':
drivers/net/ethernet/seeq/ether3.c:175:40: error: 'priv' undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean 'pid'?
drivers/net/ethernet/seeq/ether3.c:176:27: error: initialization from incompatible pointer type [-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types]

This fixes the two small typos that caused the problems.

Fixes: 6fd9c53f7186 ("net: seeq: Convert timers to use timer_setup()")
