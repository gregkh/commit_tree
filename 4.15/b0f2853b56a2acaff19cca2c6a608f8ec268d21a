nvme-pci: take sglist coalescing in dma_map_sg into account

Some iommu implementations can merge physically and/or virtually
contiguous segments inside sg_map_dma.  The NVMe SGL support does not take
this into account and will warn because of falling off a loop.  Pass the
number of mapped segments to nvme_pci_setup_sgls so that the SGL setup
can take the number of mapped segments into account.
