rsi: fix a dereference on adapter before it has been null checked

The assignment of dev is dereferencing adapter before adapter has
been null checked, potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.
Fix this by simply moving the assignment of dev to a later point
after the sanity null check of adapter.
