serial: imx: Use RX_BUF_SIZE to set size of RX buffer

The imx serial driver uses PAGE_SIZE when allocating rx_buf, but then
uses RX_BUF_SIZE (which is currently defined as PAGE_SIZE) to describe
the length of the buffer when initialising the scatter gather list.

In order to ensure that this stays consistent, use RX_BUF_SIZE in both
locations.
