scsi: mpt3sas: Processing of Cable Exception events

Earlier Active Cable Exception event with reason code "Cable Degraded
(0x02))" was added only for Active Cable. Now this event is extended to
Passive cable too. Re-arranged display message accordingly.

Also added Cable Exception Event event for SAS3008 & SAS3108 HBAs
(i.e. MPI 2.5 spec supporting HBAs). Previously, this event was enabled
only for MPI 2.6 spec supporting HBA devices.
