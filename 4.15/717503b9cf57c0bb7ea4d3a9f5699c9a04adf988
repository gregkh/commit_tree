net: sched: convert cls_flower->egress_dev users to tc_setup_cb_egdev infra

The only user of cls_flower->egress_dev is mlx5. So do the conversion
there alongside with the code originating the call in cls_flower
function fl_hw_replace_filter to the newly introduced egress device
callback infrastucture.
