ALSA: ac97: add an ac97 bus

AC97 is a bus for sound usage. It enables for a AC97 AC-Link to link one
controller to 0 to 4 AC97 codecs.

The goal of this new implementation is to implement a device/driver
model for AC97, with an automatic scan of the bus and automatic
discovery of AC97 codec devices.
