sched/deadline: Don't use dubious signed bitfields

It doesn't cause a run-time bug, but these bitfields should be unsigned.
When it's signed ->dl_throttled is set to either 0 or -1, instead of
0 and 1 as expected.

The sched.h file is included into tons of places so Sparse generates
a flood of warnings like this:

  ./include/linux/sched.h:477:54: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield
