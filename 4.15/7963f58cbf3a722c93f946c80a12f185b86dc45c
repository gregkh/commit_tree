mtd: nand: denali: fix setup_data_interface to meet tCCS delay

The WE_2_RE register specifies the number of clock cycles inserted
between the rising edge of #WE and the falling edge of #RE.

The current setup_data_interface implementation takes care of tWHR,
but tCCS is missing.  Wait for max(tCSS, tWHR) to meet the spec.

With setup_data_interface() properly programmed, the Denali NAND
controller can observe the timing, so NAND_WAIT_TCCS flag is unneeded.
Clarify this in the comment block.
