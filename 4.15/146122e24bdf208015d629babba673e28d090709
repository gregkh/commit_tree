x86/mm/dump_pagetables: Make the address hints correct and readable

The address hints are a trainwreck. The array entry numbers have to kept
magically in sync with the actual hints, which is doomed as some of the
array members are initialized at runtime via the entry numbers.

Designated initializers have been around before this code was
implemented....

Use the entry numbers to populate the address hints array and add the
missing bits and pieces. Split 32 and 64 bit for readability sake.
