gpio: mmio: Make pin2mask() a private business

The vtable call pin2mask() was introducing a vtable function call
in every gpiochip callback for a generic MMIO GPIO chip. This was
not exactly efficient. (Maybe link-time optimization could get rid of
it, I don't know.)

After removing all external calls into this API we can make it a
boolean flag in the struct gpio_chip call and sink the function into
the gpio-mmio driver yielding encapsulation and potential speedups.
