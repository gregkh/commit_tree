s390/qeth: don't apply takeover changes to RXIP

When takeover is switched off, current code clears the 'TAKEOVER' flag on
all IPs. But the flag is also used for RXIP addresses, and those should
not be affected by the takeover mode.
Fix the behaviour by consistenly applying takover logic to NORMAL
addresses only.
