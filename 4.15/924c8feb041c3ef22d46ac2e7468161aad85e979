powerpc/lib/sstep: Add XER bits introduced in POWER ISA v3.0

This adds definitions for the OV32 and CA32 bits of XER that
were introduced in POWER ISA v3.0. There are some existing
instructions that currently set the OV and CA bits based on
certain conditions.

The emulation behaviour of all these instructions needs to
be updated to set these new bits accordingly.
