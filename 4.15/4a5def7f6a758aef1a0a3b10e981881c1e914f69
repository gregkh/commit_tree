VSOCK: Don't set sk_state to TCP_CLOSE before testing it

A recent commit (3b4477d2dcf2) converted the sk_state to use
TCP constants. In that change, vmci_transport_handle_detach
was changed such that sk->sk_state was set to TCP_CLOSE before
we test whether it is TCP_SYN_SENT. This change moves the
sk_state change back to the original locations in that function.
