drm/atomic: Make atomic helper track newly assigned planes correctly, v2.

Commit 669c9215afea ("drm/atomic: Make async plane update checks work as
intended, v2.") forced planes to always be tracked, but forgot to
explicitly get the crtc commit from the new crtc when available.

This broke plane commit tracking, and caused kms_atomic_transitions
to randomly fail with -EBUSY.

Changes since v1:
- Prefer new_crtc_state->crtc above old_crtc_state->crtc.
