ARM: dts: Add Broadcom Hurricane 2 DTS include file

Describe the Broadcom Hurricane 2 SoC comprised of a Cortex-A9 CPU
complex along with standard iProc peripherals:

* timers
* SPI controller
* NAND controller
* a single AMAC (Ethernet MAC controller)
* dual PCIe controllers

The design is largely similar to existing iProc-based SoCs such as
Northstar Plus.
