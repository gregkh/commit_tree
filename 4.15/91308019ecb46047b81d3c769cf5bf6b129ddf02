crypto: atmel-aes - properly set IV after {en,de}crypt

Certain cipher modes like CTS expect the IV (req->info) of
ablkcipher_request (or equivalently req->iv of skcipher_request) to
contain the last ciphertext block when the {en,de}crypt operation is done.

Fix this issue for the Atmel AES hardware engine. The tcrypt test
case for cts(cbc(aes)) is now correctly passed.

In the case of in-place decryption, copy the ciphertext in an
intermediate buffer before decryption.
