powerpc/xmon: Add kstack base to paca dump

When dumping the paca in xmon we currently show kstack. Although it's
not hard it's a bit fiddly to work out what the bounds of the kernel
stack should be based on the kstack value.

To make life easier and "kstack_base" which is the base (lowest
address) of the kernel stack, eg:

 kstack               = 0xc0000000f1a7be30      (0x258)
 kstack_base          = 0xc0000000f1a78000
