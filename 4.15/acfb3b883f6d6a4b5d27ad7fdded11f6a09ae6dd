arm64: KVM: Fix SMCCC handling of unimplemented SMC/HVC calls

KVM doesn't follow the SMCCC when it comes to unimplemented calls,
and inject an UNDEF instead of returning an error. Since firmware
calls are now used for security mitigation, they are becoming more
common, and the undef is counter productive.

Instead, let's follow the SMCCC which states that -1 must be returned
to the caller when getting an unknown function number.
