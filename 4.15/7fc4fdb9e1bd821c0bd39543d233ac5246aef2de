media: v4l: async: Correctly serialise async sub-device unregistration

The check whether an async sub-device is bound to a notifier was performed
without list_lock held, making it possible for another process to
unbind the async sub-device before the sub-device unregistration function
proceeds to take the lock.

Fix this by first acquiring the lock and then proceeding with the check.
