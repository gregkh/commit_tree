ALSA: hda - change the location for one mic on a Lenovo machine

There are two front mics on this machine, and current driver assign
the same name Mic to both of them, but pulseaudio can't handle them.
As a workaround, we change the location for one of them, then the
driver will assign "Front Mic" and "Mic" for them.
