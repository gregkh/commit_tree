KVM: arm/arm64: GICv4: Use the doorbell interrupt as an unblocking source

The doorbell interrupt is only useful if the vcpu is blocked on WFI.
In all other cases, recieving a doorbell interrupt is just a waste
of cycles.

So let's only enable the doorbell if a vcpu is getting blocked,
and disable it when it is unblocked. This is very similar to
what we're doing for the background timer.
