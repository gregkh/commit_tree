s390/qeth: don't take queue lock in send_packet_fast()

Locking the output queue prior to TX is needed on OSA devices,
to synchronize against a packing flush from the TX completion code
(via qeth_check_outbound_queue()).
But send_packet_fast() is only used for IQDs, which don't do packing.
So remove the locking, and apply some easy cleanups.
