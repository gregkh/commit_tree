drm/i915: Early rejection of mappable GGTT pin attempts for large bo

Currently, we reject attempting to pin a large bo into the mappable
aperture, but only after trying to create the vma. Under debug kernels,
repeatedly creating and freeing that vma for an oversized bo consumes
one-third of the runtime for pwrite/pread tests as it is spent on
kmalloc/kfree tracking. If we move the rejection to before creating that
vma, we lose some accuracy of checking against the fence_size as opposed
to object size, though the fence can never be smaller than the object.
Note that the vma creation itself will reject an attempt to create a vma
larger than the GTT so we can remove one redundant test.
