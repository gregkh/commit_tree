Btrfs: only check delayed ref usage in should_end_transaction

We were only doing btrfs_check_space_for_delayed_refs() if the metadata
space was full, ie we couldn't allocate chunks.  This assumes we'll be
able to allocate chunks during transaction commit, but since nothing
does a LIMIT flush during the transaction commit this won't actually
happen unless we happen to run shy of actual space.  We already take
into account a full fs in btrfs_check_space_for_delayed_refs() so just
kill this extra check to make sure we're ending the transaction when we
need to.
