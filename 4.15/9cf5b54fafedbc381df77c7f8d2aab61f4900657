arm64: fpsimd: Simplify uses of {set,clear}_ti_thread_flag()

The existing FPSIMD context switch code contains a couple of
instances of {set,clear}_ti_thread(task_thread_info(task)).  Since
there are thread flag manipulators that operate directly on
task_struct, this verbosity isn't strictly needed.

For consistency, this patch simplifies the affected calls.  This
should have no impact on behaviour.
