net: accept UFO datagrams from tuntap and packet

Tuntap and similar devices can inject GSO packets. Accept type
VIRTIO_NET_HDR_GSO_UDP, even though not generating UFO natively.

Processes are expected to use feature negotiation such as TUNSETOFFLOAD
to detect supported offload types and refrain from injecting other
packets. This process breaks down with live migration: guest kernels
do not renegotiate flags, so destination hosts need to expose all
features that the source host does.

Partially revert the UFO removal from 182e0b6b5846~1..d9d30adf5677.
This patch introduces nearly(*) no new code to simplify verification.
It brings back verbatim tuntap UFO negotiation, VIRTIO_NET_HDR_GSO_UDP
insertion and software UFO segmentation.

It does not reinstate protocol stack support, hardware offload
(NETIF_F_UFO), SKB_GSO_UDP tunneling in SKB_GSO_SOFTWARE or reception
of VIRTIO_NET_HDR_GSO_UDP packets in tuntap.

To support SKB_GSO_UDP reappearing in the stack, also reinstate
logic in act_csum and openvswitch. Achieve equivalence with v4.13 HEAD
by squashing in commit 939912216fa8 ("net: skb_needs_check() removes
CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY check for tx.") and reverting commit 8d63bee643f1
("net: avoid skb_warn_bad_offload false positives on UFO").

(*) To avoid having to bring back skb_shinfo(skb)->ip6_frag_id,
ipv6_proxy_select_ident is changed to return a __be32 and this is
assigned directly to the frag_hdr. Also, SKB_GSO_UDP is inserted
at the end of the enum to minimize code churn.

Tested
  Booted a v4.13 guest kernel with QEMU. On a host kernel before this
  patch `ethtool -k eth0` shows UFO disabled. After the patch, it is
  enabled, same as on a v4.13 host kernel.

  A UFO packet sent from the guest appears on the tap device:
    host:
      nc -l -p -u 8000 &
      tcpdump -n -i tap0

    guest:
      dd if=/dev/zero of=payload.txt bs=1 count=2000
      nc -u 192.16.1.1 8000 < payload.txt

  Direct tap to tap transmission of VIRTIO_NET_HDR_GSO_UDP succeeds,
  packets arriving fragmented:

    ./with_tap_pair.sh ./tap_send_ufo tap0 tap1
