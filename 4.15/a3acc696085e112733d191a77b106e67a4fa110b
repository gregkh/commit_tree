usb: f_fs: Force Reserved1=1 in OS_DESC_EXT_COMPAT

The specification says that the Reserved1 field in OS_DESC_EXT_COMPAT
must have the value "1", but when this feature was first implemented we
rejected any non-zero values.

This was adjusted to accept all non-zero values (while now rejecting
zero) in commit 53642399aa71 ("usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix wrong check on
reserved1 of OS_DESC_EXT_COMPAT"), but that breaks any userspace
programs that worked previously by returning EINVAL when Reserved1 == 0
which was previously the only value that succeeded!

If we just set the field to "1" ourselves, both old and new userspace
programs continue to work correctly and, as a bonus, old programs are
now compliant with the specification without having to fix anything
themselves.
