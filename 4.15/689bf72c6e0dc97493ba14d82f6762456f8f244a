usb: dwc3: Don't reinitialize core during host bus-suspend/resume

Driver powers-off PHYs and reinitializes DWC3 core and gadget on
resume. While this works fine for gadget mode but in host
mode there is not re-initialization of host stack. Also, resetting
bus as part of bus_suspend/resume is not correct which could affect
(or disconnect) connected devices.
Fix this by not reinitializing core on suspend/resume in host mode
for HOST only and OTG/drd configurations.
