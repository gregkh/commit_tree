scsi: storvsc: Fix scsi_cmd error assignments in storvsc_handle_error

When an I/O is returned with an srb_status of SRB_STATUS_INVALID_LUN
which has zero good_bytes it must be assigned an error. Otherwise the
I/O will be continuously requeued and will cause a deadlock in the case
where disks are being hot added and removed. sd_probe_async will wait
forever for its I/O to complete while holding scsi_sd_probe_domain.

Also returning the default error of DID_TARGET_FAILURE causes multipath
to not retry the I/O resulting in applications receiving I/O errors
before a failover can occur.
