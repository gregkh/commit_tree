spi: orion: remove redundant assignment of status to zero

The assignment of status to zero is never read, status is either
updated in the next iteration of the of the loop or several
lines after the end of the loop.  Remove it, cleans up clang warning:

drivers/spi/spi-orion.c:674:4: warning: Value stored to 'status'
is never read
