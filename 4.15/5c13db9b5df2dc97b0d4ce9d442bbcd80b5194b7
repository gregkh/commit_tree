zfcp: purely mechanical update using timer API, plus blank lines

erp_memwait only occurs in seldom memory pressure situations.
The typical case never uses the associated timer and thus also
does not need to initialize the timer.
Also, we don't want to re-initialize the timer each time we re-use an
erp_action in zfcp_erp_setup_act() [see also v4.14-rc7 commit ab31fd0ce65e
("scsi: zfcp: fix erp_action use-before-initialize in REC action trace")
for erp_action life cycle].
Hence, retain the lazy inintialization of zfcp_erp_action.timer
in zfcp_erp_strategy_memwait().

Add an empty line after declarations in zfcp_erp_timeout_handler()
and zfcp_fsf_request_timeout_handler() even though it was also missing
before the timer conversion.

Fix checkpatch warning:
WARNING: function definition argument 'struct timer_list *' should also have an identifier name
+extern void zfcp_erp_timeout_handler(struct timer_list *);
