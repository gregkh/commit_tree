ibmvnic: Allocate and request vpd in init_resources

In reset events in which our memory allocations need to be reallocated,
VPD data is being freed, but never reallocated. This can cause issues if
we later attempt to access that memory or reset and attempt to free the
memory. This patch moves the allocation of the VPD data to init_resources
so that it will be symmetrically freed during release resources.
