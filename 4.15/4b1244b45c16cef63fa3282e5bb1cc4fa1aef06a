x86/apic: Move logical APIC ID away from apic_bsp_setup()

apic_bsp_setup() sets and returns logical APIC ID for initializing
cpu0_logical_apicid in a SMP-capable system.

The id has nothing to do with the initialization of local APIC and I/O
APIC. And apic_bsp_setup() should be called for interrupt mode setup only.

Move the id setup into a separate helper function for cleanup and mark
apic_bsp_setup() void.
