ipv4: Make neigh lookup keys for loopback/point-to-point devices be INADDR_ANY

Map all lookup neigh keys to INADDR_ANY for loopback/point-to-point devices
to avoid making an entry for every remote ip the device needs to talk to.

This used the be the old behavior but became broken in a263b3093641f
(ipv4: Make neigh lookups directly in output packet path) and later removed
in 0bb4087cbec0 (ipv4: Fix neigh lookup keying over loopback/point-to-point
devices) because it was broken.
