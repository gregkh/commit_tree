IB/mlx5: Expose multi-packet RQ capabilities

This patch reports the device's striding RQ capabilities to
the user-space:
- min/max_single_stride_log_num_of_bytes: Log of min/max number of
  bytes in a single stride.
- min/max_single_wqe_log_num_of_strides: Log of min/max number of
  strides in a single WQE.
- supported_qpts: A bit mask to know which QP types support multi-
  packet RQ, for now only Raw Packet QPs.
