IB/qib: Remove remaining code related to writing the EEPROM

Due to removal of the EEPROM writing code, the qib_inc_eeprom_err()
macro became a no-op. Remove the code that calls it. Since that
change removes all code that reads the eep_st_masks array, also
remove the code that updates that array and the array itself.
