platform/x86: wmi: Add new method wmidev_evaluate_method

Drivers properly using the wmibus can pass their wmi_device
pointer rather than the GUID back to the WMI bus to evaluate
the proper methods.

Any "new" drivers added that use the WMI bus should use this
rather than the old wmi_evaluate_method that would take the
GUID.
