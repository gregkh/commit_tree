Documentation: add Kernel Driver Statement to the kernel

Way back in 2008 we didn't have "robust" in-kernel documentation system,
so the idea of putting something like the kernel driver statement in the
kernel tree wasn't even imagined.  But now that has changed, so add the
old document to the kernel source itself to allow for us to properly
reference it in one canonical place (as the LF wiki keeps moving things
around.)

This also will allow people to add their names to it, as I seem to have
lost the ability to do that by not knowing how to edit things on the
original document.
