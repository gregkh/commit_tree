arm/arm64: pmu: Distinguish percpu irq and percpu_devid irq

arm_pmu interrupts are maked as PERCPU even when these are not local
physical interrupts to a single CPU. When using non-local interrupts,
interrupts marked as PERCPU will not get freed not disabled properly
by the PMU driver.

Check if interrupts are local to a single CPU with PERCPU_DEVID since
this is what the PMU driver really needs to know.
