xen: support 52 bit physical addresses in pv guests

Physical addresses on processors supporting 5 level paging can be up to
52 bits wide. For a Xen pv guest running on such a machine those
physical addresses have to be supported in order to be able to use any
memory on the machine even if the guest itself does not support 5 level
paging.

So when reading/writing a MFN from/to a pte don't use the kernel's
PTE_PFN_MASK but a new XEN_PTE_MFN_MASK allowing full 40 bit wide MFNs.
