drm/i915/execlists: Keep request->priority for its lifetime

With preemption, we will want to "unsubmit" a request, taking it back
from the hw and returning it to the priority sorted execution list. In
order to know where to insert it into that list, we need to remember
its adjust priority (which may change even as it was being executed).

This also affects reset for execlists as we are now unsubmitting the
requests following the reset (rather than directly writing the ELSP for
the inflight contexts). This turns reset into an accidental preemption
point, as after the reset we may choose a different pair of contexts to
submit to hw.

GuC is not updated as this series doesn't add preemption to the GuC
submission, and so it can keep benefiting from the early pruning of the
DFS inside execlists_schedule() for a little longer. We also need to
find a way of reducing the cost of that DFS...

v2: Include priority in error-state
