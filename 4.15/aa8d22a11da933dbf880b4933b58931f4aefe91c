mm: swap: SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO: skip swapcache only if swapped page has no other reference

When SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO swapped-in pages are shared by several
processes, it can cause unnecessary memory wastage by skipping swap
cache.  Because, with swapin fault by read, they could share a page if
the page were in swap cache.  Thus, it avoids allocating same content
new pages.

This patch makes the swapcache skipping work only if the swap pte is
non-sharable.
