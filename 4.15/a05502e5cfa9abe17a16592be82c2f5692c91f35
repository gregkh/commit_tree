drm/amdgpu: Reserve shared memory on VRAM for SR-IOV

SR-IOV need to reserve a piece of shared VRAM at the exact place
to exchange data betweem PF and VF. The start address and size of
the shared mem are passed to guest through VBIOS structure
VRAM_UsageByFirmware.

VRAM_UsageByFirmware is a general feature in VBIOS, it indicates
that VBIOS need to reserve a piece of memory on the VRAM.

Because the mem address is specified. Reserve it early in
amdgpu_ttm_init to make sure that it can monoplize the space.
