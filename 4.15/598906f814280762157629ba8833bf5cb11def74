blk-flush: use blk_mq_request_bypass_insert()

In the following patch, we will use RQF_FLUSH_SEQ to decide:

1) if the flag isn't set, the flush rq need to be inserted via
blk_insert_flush()

2) otherwise, the flush rq need to be dispatched directly since
it is in flush machinery now.

So we use blk_mq_request_bypass_insert() for requests of bypassing
flush machinery, just like the legacy path did.
