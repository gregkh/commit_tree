lightnvm: pblk: fix min size for page mempool

pblk uses an internal page mempool for allocating pages on internal
bios. The main two users of this memory pool are partial reads (reads
with some sectors in cache and some on media) and padded writes, which
need to add dummy pages to an existing bio already containing valid
data (and with a large enough bioset allocated). In both cases, the
maximum number of pages per bio is defined by the maximum number of
physical sectors supported by the underlying device.

This patch fixes a bad mempool allocation, where the min_nr of elements
on the pool was fixed (to 16), which is lower than the maximum number
of sectors supported by NVMe (as of the time for this patch). Instead,
use the maximum number of allowed sectors reported by the device.
