xfrm: Copy policy family in clone_policy

The syzbot found an ancient bug in the IPsec code.  When we cloned
a socket policy (for example, for a child TCP socket derived from a
listening socket), we did not copy the family field.  This results
in a live policy with a zero family field.  This triggers a BUG_ON
check in the af_key code when the cloned policy is retrieved.

This patch fixes it by copying the family field over.
