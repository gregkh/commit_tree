net: dsa: b53: Defer port enabling to calling port_enable

There is no need to configure the enabled ports once in b53_setup() and then a
second time around when dsa_switch_ops::port_enable is called, just do it when
port_enable is called which is better in terms of power consumption and
correctness.
