block: Invalidate cache on discard v2

It is reasonable drop page cache on discard, otherwise that pages may
be written by writeback second later, so thin provision devices will
not be happy. This seems to be a  security leak in case of secure discard case.

Also add check for queue_discard flag on early stage.
