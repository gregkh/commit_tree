MIPS: Set defconfig target to a generic system for 32r2el

The default system type should be a MIPS generic kernel. In order to
include some level of board support, select a 32r2el generic defconfig
by default. The alternative would be to use "generic_defconfig" but
rather unintuitvely that is a bare bones configuration with no platform
support so is not usable in practice.
