crypto: crypto4xx - use the correct LE32 format for IV and key defs

The hardware expects that the keys, IVs (and inner/outer hashes)
are in the le32 format.

This patch changes all hardware interface declarations to use
the correct LE32 data format for each field.

In order to pass __CHECK_ENDIAN__ checks, crypto4xx_memcpy_le
has to be honest about the endianness of its parameters.
The function was split and moved to the common crypto4xx_core.h
header. This allows the compiler to generate better code if the
sizes/len is a constant (various *_IV_LEN).

Please note that the hardware isn't consistent with the endiannes
of the save_digest field in the state record struct though.
The hashes produced by GHASH and CBC (for CCM) will be in LE32.
Whereas md5 and sha{1/,256,...} do not need any conversion.
