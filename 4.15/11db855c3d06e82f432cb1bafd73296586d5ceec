Revert "cpuset: Make cpuset hotplug synchronous"

This reverts commit 1599a185f0e6113be185b9fb809c621c73865829.

This and the previous commit led to another circular locking scenario
and the scenario which is fixed by this commit no longer exists after
e8b3f8db7aad ("workqueue/hotplug: simplify workqueue_offline_cpu()")
which removes work item flushing from hotplug path.

Revert it for now.
