drm/i915/selftests: Disable iommu for the mock device

On some machines, the iommu cannot allocate a domain for the mock device
causing the dma_map_sg() to fail, and the selftest to fail with -ENOMEM.
For the mock selftests, we are using a fake device and do not care about
iommu; so convince intel_iommu to treat us as a dummy device with an
identity mapping (and no iommu domain).
