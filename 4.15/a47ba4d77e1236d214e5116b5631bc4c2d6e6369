perf/x86: Enable free running PEBS for REGS_USER/INTR

Currently free running PEBS is disabled when user or interrupt
registers are requested. Most of the registers are actually
available in the PEBS record and can be supported.

So we just need to check for the supported registers and then
allow it: it is all except for the segment register.

For user registers this only works when the counter is limited
to ring 3 only, so this also needs to be checked.
