nbd: don't start req until after the dead connection logic

We can end up sleeping for a while waiting for the dead timeout, which
means we could get the per request timer to fire.  We did handle this
case, but if the dead timeout happened right after we submitted we'd
either tear down the connection or possibly requeue as we're handling an
error and race with the endio which can lead to panics and other
hilarity.
