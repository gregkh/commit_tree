ALSA: seq: Remove spurious WARN_ON() at timer check

The use of snd_BUG_ON() in ALSA sequencer timer may lead to a spurious
WARN_ON() when a slave timer is deployed as its backend and a
corresponding master timer stops meanwhile.  The symptom was triggered
by syzkaller spontaneously.

Since the NULL timer is valid there, rip off snd_BUG_ON().
