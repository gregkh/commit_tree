dm raid: fix panic when attempting to force a raid to sync

Requesting a sync on an active raid device via a table reload
(see 'sync' parameter in Documentation/device-mapper/dm-raid.txt)
skips the super_load() call that defines the superblock size
(rdev->sb_size) -- resulting in an oops if/when super_sync()->memset()
is called.

Fix by moving the initialization of the superblock start and size
out of super_load() to the caller (analyse_superblocks).
