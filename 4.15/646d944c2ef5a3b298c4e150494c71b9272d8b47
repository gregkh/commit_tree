xen/pvcalls: fix potential endless loop in pvcalls-front.c

mutex_trylock() returns 1 if you take the lock and 0 if not. Assume you
take in_mutex on the first try, but you can't take out_mutex. Next times
you call mutex_trylock() in_mutex is going to fail. It's an endless
loop.

Solve the problem by waiting until the global refcount is 1 instead (the
refcount is 1 when the only active pvcalls frontend function is
pvcalls_front_release).
