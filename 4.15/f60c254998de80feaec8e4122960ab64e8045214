mlxsw: spectrum: mr: Support trap-and-forward routes

Add the support of trap-and-forward route action in the multicast routing
offloading logic. A route will be set to trap-and-forward action if one (or
more) of its output interfaces is not offload-able, i.e. does not have a
valid Spectrum RIF.

This way, a route with mixed output VIFs list, which contains both
offload-able and un-offload-able devices can go through partial offloading
in hardware, and the rest will be done in the kernel ipmr module.
