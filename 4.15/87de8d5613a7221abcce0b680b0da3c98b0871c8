drm/i915: Stop engines before reset

On kbl evidence indicates that even if the hardware happily
tells us to proceed with reset, it really isn't ready.
Resetting a freely running batchbuffer after we have ack for readiness,
still can cause a system hang.

We also have similar experiences on older gens. So now
attempt to stop engines before proceeding for reset, on all
gens where we have a gpu reset. This has shown to improve reset
reliability and reduce the risk of losing the machine.

v2: Add fixme for wa (Joonas)
