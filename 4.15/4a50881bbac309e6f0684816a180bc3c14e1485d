IB/core: Verify that QP is security enabled in create and destroy

The XRC target QP create flow sets up qp_sec only if there is an IB link with
LSM security enabled. However, several other related uAPI entry points blindly
follow the qp_sec NULL pointer, resulting in a possible oops.

Check for NULL before using qp_sec.
