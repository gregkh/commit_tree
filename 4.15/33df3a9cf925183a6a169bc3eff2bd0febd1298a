xfs: always honor OWN_UNKNOWN rmap removal requests

Calling xfs_rmap_free with an unknown owner is supposed to remove any
rmaps covering that range regardless of owner.  This is used by the EFI
recovery code to say "we're freeing this, it mustn't be owned by
anything anymore", but for whatever reason xfs_free_ag_extent filters
them out.

Therefore, remove the filter and make xfs_rmap_unmap actually treat it
as a wildcard owner -- free anything that's already there, and if
there's no owner at all then that's fine too.

There are two existing callers of bmap_add_free that take care the rmap
deferred ops themselves and use OWN_UNKNOWN to skip the EFI-based rmap
cleanup; convert these to use OWN_NULL (via helpers), and now we really
require that an RUI (if any) gets added to the defer ops before any EFI.

Lastly, now that xfs_free_extent filters out OWN_NULL rmap free requests,
growfs will have to consult directly with the rmap to ensure that there
aren't any rmaps in the grown region.
