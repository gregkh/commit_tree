xen: limit grant v2 interface to the v1 functionality

As there is currently no user for sub-page grants or transient grants
remove that functionality. This at once makes it possible to switch
from grant v2 to grant v1 without restrictions, as there is no loss of
functionality other than the limited frame number width related to
the switch.
