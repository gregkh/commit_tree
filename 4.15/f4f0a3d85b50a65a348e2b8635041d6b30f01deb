mm/hugetlb: fix NULL-pointer dereference on 5-level paging machine

I made a mistake during converting hugetlb code to 5-level paging: in
huge_pte_alloc() we have to use p4d_alloc(), not p4d_offset().

Otherwise it leads to crash -- NULL-pointer dereference in pud_alloc()
if p4d table is not yet allocated.

It only can happen in 5-level paging mode.  In 4-level paging mode
p4d_offset() always returns pgd, so we are fine.
