regset: Add support for dynamically sized regsets

Currently the regset API doesn't allow for the possibility that
regsets (or at least, the amount of meaningful data in a regset)
may change in size.

In particular, this results in useless padding being added to
coredumps if a regset's current size is smaller than its
theoretical maximum size.

This patch adds a get_size() function to struct user_regset.
Individual regset implementations can implement this function to
return the current size of the regset data.  A regset_size()
function is added to provide callers with an abstract interface for
determining the size of a regset without needing to know whether
the regset is dynamically sized or not.

The only affected user of this interface is the ELF coredump code:
This patch ports ELF coredump to dump regsets with their actual
size in the coredump.  This has no effect except for new regsets
that are dynamically sized and provide a get_size() implementation.
