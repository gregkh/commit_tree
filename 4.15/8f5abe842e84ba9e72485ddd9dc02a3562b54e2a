proc: don't report kernel addresses in /proc/<pid>/stack

This just changes the file to report them as zero, although maybe even
that could be removed.  I checked, and at least procps doesn't actually
seem to parse the 'stack' file at all.

And since the file doesn't necessarily even exist (it requires
CONFIG_STACKTRACE), possibly other tools don't really use it either.

That said, in case somebody parses it with tools, just having that zero
there should keep such tools happy.
