rbd: fix and simplify rbd_ioctl_set_ro()

->open_count/-EBUSY check is bogus and wrong: when an open device is
set read-only, blkdev_write_iter() refuses further writes with -EPERM.
This is standard behaviour and all other block devices allow this.

set_disk_ro() call is also problematic: we affect the entire device
when called on a single partition.

All rbd_ioctl_set_ro() needs to do is refuse ro -> rw transition for
mapped snapshots.  Everything else can be handled by generic code.
