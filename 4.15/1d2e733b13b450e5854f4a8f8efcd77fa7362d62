resource: Provide resource struct in resource walk callback

In preperation for a new function that will need additional resource
information during the resource walk, update the resource walk callback to
pass the resource structure.  Since the current callback start and end
arguments are pulled from the resource structure, the callback functions
can obtain them from the resource structure directly.
