HID: wacom: generic: Recognize WACOM_HID_WD_PEN as a type of pen collection

The WACOM_PEN_FIELD macro is used to determine if a given HID field should be
associated with pen input. This field includes several known collection types
that Wacom pen data is contained in, but the WACOM_HID_WD_PEN application
collection type is notably missing. This can result in fields within this
kind of collection being completely ignored by the `wacom_usage_mapping`
function, preventing the later '*_event' functions from being notified about
changes to their value.
