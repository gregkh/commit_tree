Revert "Bluetooth: btusb: Add workaround for Broadcom devices without product id"

Commit 9834e586fa66 ("Bluetooth: btusb: Add workaround for Broadcom devices
without product id") was added to deal with the BT part of the BCM4356A2
on GPD pocket laptops having an usb vid:pid of 0000:0000.

After another commit to add support for the BCM UART connected BT ACPI-id
BCM2E7E used on the GPD win, it turns out that the BT on the GPD pocket is
connected via both USB and UART. Adding support for the BCM2E7E ACPI-id
causes it to switch to UART mode.

The Windows shipped with the device is using it in UART mode and the
presence of the BCM2E7E ACPI-id combined with the all 0 USB vid:pid
indicates that the BT part was never meant to be used in USB mode.

With the recent patches to use serdev device enumeration / instantiation
for UART attached ACPI enumerated BT devices, everything work OOTB in UART
mode and the workaround for the all 0 USB vid:pid is no longer needed.

This reverts commit 9834e586fa ("Bluetooth: btusb: Add workaround for
Broadcom devices without product id").
