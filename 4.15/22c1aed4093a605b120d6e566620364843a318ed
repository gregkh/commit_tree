net: sh_eth: use correct "struct device" when calling DMA mapping functions

There are two types of "struct device": the one representing the
physical device on its physical bus (platform, SPI, PCI, etc.), and
the one representing the logical device in its device class (net,
etc.).

The DMA mapping API expects to receive as argument a "struct device"
representing the physical device, as the "struct device" contains
information about the bus that the DMA API needs.

However, the sh_eth driver mistakenly uses the "struct device"
representing the logical device (embedded in "struct net_device")
rather than the "struct device" representing the physical device on
its bus.

This commit fixes that by adjusting all calls to the DMA mapping API.
