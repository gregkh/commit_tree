mfd: wm97xx-core: core support for wm97xx Codec

The WM9705, WM9712 and WM9713 are highly integrated codecs, with an
audio codec, DAC and ADC, GPIO unit and a touchscreen interface.

Historically the support was spread across drivers/input/touchscreen and
sound/soc/codecs. The sharing was done through ac97 bus sharing. This
model will not withstand the new AC97 bus model, where codecs are
discovered on runtime.
