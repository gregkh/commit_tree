perf callchain: Mark inlined frames in output by " (inlined)" suffix

The original patch that introduced inline frame output in the various
browsers used this suffix already. The new centralized approach that
uses fake symbols for inlined frames was missing this approach so far.

Instead of changing the symbol name itself, we only print the suffix
where needed. This allows us to efficiently lookup the symbol for a
given name without first having to append the suffix before the lookup.
