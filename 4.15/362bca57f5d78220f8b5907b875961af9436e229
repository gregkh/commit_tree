ALSA: pcm: prevent UAF in snd_pcm_info

When the device descriptor is closed, the `substream->runtime` pointer
is freed. But another thread may be in the ioctl handler, case
SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_PCM_INFO. This case calls snd_pcm_info_user() which
calls snd_pcm_info() which accesses the now freed `substream->runtime`.

Note: this fixes CVE-2017-0861
