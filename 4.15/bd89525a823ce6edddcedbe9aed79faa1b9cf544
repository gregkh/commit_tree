KVM: x86: emulate #UD while in guest mode

This reverts commits ae1f57670703656cc9f293722c3b8b6782f8ab3f
and ac9b305caa0df6f5b75d294e4b86c1027648991e.

If the hardware doesn't support MOVBE, but L0 sets CPUID.01H:ECX.MOVBE
in L1's emulated CPUID information, then L1 is likely to pass that
CPUID bit through to L2. L2 will expect MOVBE to work, but if L1
doesn't intercept #UD, then any MOVBE instruction executed in L2 will
raise #UD, and the exception will be delivered in L2.

Commit ac9b305caa0df6f5b75d294e4b86c1027648991e is a better and more
complete version of ae1f57670703 ("KVM: nVMX: Do not emulate #UD while
in guest mode"); however, neither considers the above case.
