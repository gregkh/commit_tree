Bluetooth: mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
where we are expecting to fall through.

In this particular case, notice that I replaced the
"deliberate fall-through..." comment with a "fall through"
comment, which is what GCC is expecting to find.
