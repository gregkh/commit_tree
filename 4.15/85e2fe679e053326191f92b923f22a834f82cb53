drm/i915/guc: Submit GuC workitems containing coalesced requests

To create an upper bound on number of GuC workitems, we need to change
the way that requests are being submitted. Rather than submitting each
request as an individual workitem, we can do coalescing in a similar way
we're handlig execlist submission ports. We also need to stop pretending
that we're doing "lite-restore" in GuC submission (we would create a
workitem each time we hit this condition). This allows us to completely
remove the reservation, replacing it with a compile time check.

v2: Also coalesce when replaying on reset (Daniele)
v3: Consistent wq_resv - per-request (Daniele)
v4: Squash removing wq_resv
v5: Reflect i915_guc_submit argument changes in doc
v6: Rebase on top of execlists reset/restart fix (Chris,Michał)
