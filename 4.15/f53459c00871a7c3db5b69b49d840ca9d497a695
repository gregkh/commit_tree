w1: keep balance of mutex locks and refcnts

w1_therm_eeprom() and w1_DS18B20_precision() decrement THERM_REFCNT
on error paths, while they did not increment it yet.

read_therm() unlocks bus mutex on some error paths,
while it is not acquired.

The patch makes sure all the functions keep the balance in usage of
the mutex and the THERM_REFCNT.
