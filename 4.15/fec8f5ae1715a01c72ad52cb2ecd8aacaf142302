selftests/x86/ldt_get: Add a few additional tests for limits

We weren't testing the .limit and .limit_in_pages fields very well.
Add more tests.

This addition seems to trigger the "bits 16:19 are undefined" issue
that was fixed in an earlier patch.  I think that, at least on my
CPU, the high nibble of the limit ends in LAR bits 16:19.
