ceph: handle 'session get evicted while there are file locks'

When session get evicted, all file locks associated with the session
get released remotely by mds. File locks tracked by kernel become
stale. In this situation, set an error flag on inode. The flag makes
further file locks return -EIO.

Another option to handle this situation is cleanup file locks tracked
kernel. I do not choose it because it is inconvenient to notify user
program about the error.
