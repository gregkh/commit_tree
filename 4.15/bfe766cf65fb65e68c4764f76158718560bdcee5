arm64: kvm: Prevent restoring stale PMSCR_EL1 for vcpu

When VHE is not present, KVM needs to save and restores PMSCR_EL1 when
possible. If SPE is used by the host, value of PMSCR_EL1 cannot be saved
for the guest.
If the host starts using SPE between two save+restore on the same vcpu,
restore will write the value of PMSCR_EL1 read during the first save.

Make sure __debug_save_spe_nvhe clears the value of the saved PMSCR_EL1
when the guest cannot use SPE.
