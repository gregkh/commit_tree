bus: arm-cci: Fix use of smp_processor_id() in preemptible context

The ARM CCI driver seem to be using smp_processor_id() in a
preemptible context, which is likely to make a DEBUG_PREMPT
kernel scream at boot time.

Turn this into a get_cpu()/put_cpu() that extends over the CPU
hotplug registration, making sure that we don't race against
a CPU down operation.
