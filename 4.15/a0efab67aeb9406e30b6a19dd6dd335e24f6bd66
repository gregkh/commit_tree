ip_gre: add the support for i/o_flags update via ioctl

As patch 'ip_gre: add the support for i/o_flags update via netlink'
did for netlink, we also need to do the same job for these update
via ioctl.

This patch is to update i/o_flags and call ipgre_link_update to
recalculate these gre properties after ip_tunnel_ioctl does the
common update.
