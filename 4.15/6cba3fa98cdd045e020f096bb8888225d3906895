ASoC: rsnd: more clear ADG clock debug info

ADG inputs clock from CLK{A,B,C,I} and outputs clock from
CLKOUT{0,1,2,3} which is selected by BRG{A,B}.
Now, ADG is assuming BRGA is for 44100Hz related clocks,
BRGB is for 48000Hz related clocks.

Clock related debug is very difficult/confusable.
This patch cleanups clock related debug info.
