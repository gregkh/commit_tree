fbdev: controlfb: Add missing modes to fix out of bounds access

Dan's static analysis says:

    drivers/video/fbdev/controlfb.c:560 control_setup()
    error: buffer overflow 'control_mac_modes' 20 <= 21

Indeed, control_mac_modes[] has only 20 elements, while VMODE_MAX is 22,
which may lead to an out of bounds read when parsing vmode commandline
options.

The bug was introduced in v2.4.5.6, when 2 new modes were added to
macmodes.h, but control_mac_modes[] wasn't updated:

https://kernel.opensuse.org/cgit/kernel/diff/include/video/macmodes.h?h=v2.5.2&id=29f279c764808560eaceb88fef36cbc35c529aad

Augment control_mac_modes[] with the two new video modes to fix this.
