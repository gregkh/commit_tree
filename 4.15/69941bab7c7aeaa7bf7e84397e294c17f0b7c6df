ASoC: snd_soc_component_driver has non_legacy_dai_naming

Codec will be replaced into Component, then Codec side
doesn't use legacy_dai_naming on snd_soc_register_dais().

This patch adds new non_legacy_dai_naming flag on Component driver
and use converted its value for snd_soc_register_dais().

When Codec is replaced into Component, Codec driver needs
to have non_legacy_dai_naming = 1 flags.
Existing CPU side of course doesn't have this flag, thus CPU calls
it as true.
