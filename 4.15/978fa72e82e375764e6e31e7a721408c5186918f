s390: remove named saved segment support

Remove the support to create a z/VM named saved segment (NSS). This
feature is not supported since quite a while in favour of jump labels,
function tracing and (now) CPU alternatives. All of these features
require to write to the kernel text section which is not possible if
the kernel is contained within an NSS.

Given that memory savings are minimal if kernel images are shared and
in addition updates of shared images are painful, the NSS feature can
be removed.
