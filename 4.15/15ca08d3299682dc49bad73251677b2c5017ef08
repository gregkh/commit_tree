nfsd: Fix stateid races between OPEN and CLOSE

Open file stateids can linger on the nfs4_file list of stateids even
after they have been closed. In order to avoid reusing such a
stateid, and confusing the client, we need to recheck the
nfs4_stid's type after taking the mutex.
Otherwise, we risk reusing an old stateid that was already closed,
which will confuse clients that expect new stateids to conform to
RFC7530 Sections 9.1.4.2 and 16.2.5 or RFC5661 Sections 8.2.2 and 18.2.4.
