arm64: Update fault_info table with new exception types

Based on: ARM Architecture Reference Manual, ARMv8 (DDI 0487B.b).

ARMv8.1 introduces the optional feature ARMv8.1-TTHM which can trigger a
new type of memory abort. This exception is triggered when hardware update
of page table flags is not atomic in regards to other memory accesses.
Replace the corresponding unknown entry with a more accurate one.

Cf: Section D10.2.28 ESR_ELx, Exception Syndrome Register (p D10-2381),
section D4.4.11 Restriction on memory types for hardware updates on page
tables (p D4-2116 - D4-2117).

ARMv8.2 does not add new exception types, however it is worth mentioning
that when obligatory feature RAS (optional for ARMv8.{0,1}) is implemented,
exceptions related to "Synchronous parity or ECC error on memory access,
not on translation table walk" become reserved and should not occur.
