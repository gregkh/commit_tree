userfaultfd: clear the vma->vm_userfaultfd_ctx if UFFD_EVENT_FORK fails

The previous fix in commit 384632e67e08 ("userfaultfd: non-cooperative:
fix fork use after free") corrected the refcounting in case of
UFFD_EVENT_FORK failure for the fork userfault paths.

That still didn't clear the vma->vm_userfaultfd_ctx of the vmas that
were set to point to the aborted new uffd ctx earlier in
dup_userfaultfd.
