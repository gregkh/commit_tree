arm64: use WFE for long delays

The current delay implementation uses the yield instruction, which is a
hint that it is beneficial to schedule another thread. As this is a hint,
it may be implemented as a NOP, causing all delays to be busy loops. This
is the case for many existing CPUs.

Taking advantage of the generic timer sending periodic events to all
cores, we can use WFE during delays to reduce power consumption. This is
beneficial only for delays longer than the period of the timer event
stream.

If timer event stream is not enabled, delays will behave as yield/busy
loops.
