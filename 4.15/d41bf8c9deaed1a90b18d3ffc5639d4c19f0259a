cgroup, sched: Move basic cpu stats from cgroup.stat to cpu.stat

The basic cpu stat is currently shown with "cpu." prefix in
cgroup.stat, and the same information is duplicated in cpu.stat when
cpu controller is enabled.  This is ugly and not very scalable as we
want to expand the coverage of stat information which is always
available.

This patch makes cgroup core always create "cpu.stat" file and show
the basic cpu stat there and calls the cpu controller to show the
extra stats when enabled.  This ensures that the same information
isn't presented in multiple places and makes future expansion of basic
stats easier.
