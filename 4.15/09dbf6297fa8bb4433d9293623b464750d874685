mlxsw: spectrum_router: Update nexthop RIF on update

The function mlxsw_sp_nexthop_rif_update() walks the list of nexthops
associated with a RIF, and updates the corresponding entries in the
switch. It is used in particular when a tunnel underlay netdevice moves
to a different VRF, and all the nexthops are migrated over to a new RIF.
The problem is that each nexthop holds a reference to its RIF, and that
is not updated. So after the old RIF is gone, further activity on these
nexthops (such as downing the underlay netdevice) dereferences a
dangling pointer.

Fix the issue by updating rif of impacted nexthops before calling
mlxsw_sp_nexthop_rif_update().
