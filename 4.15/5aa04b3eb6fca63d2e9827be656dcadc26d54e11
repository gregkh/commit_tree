powerpc/perf: Fix oops when grouping different pmu events

When user tries to group imc (In-Memory Collections) event with
normal event, (sometime) kernel crashes with following log:

    Faulting instruction address: 0x00000000
    [link register   ] c00000000010ce88 power_check_constraints+0x128/0x980
    ...
    c00000000010e238 power_pmu_event_init+0x268/0x6f0
    c0000000002dc60c perf_try_init_event+0xdc/0x1a0
    c0000000002dce88 perf_event_alloc+0x7b8/0xac0
    c0000000002e92e0 SyS_perf_event_open+0x530/0xda0
    c00000000000b004 system_call+0x38/0xe0

'event_base' field of 'struct hw_perf_event' is used as flags for
normal hw events and used as memory address for imc events. While
grouping these two types of events, collect_events() tries to
interpret imc 'event_base' as a flag, which causes a corruption
resulting in a crash.

Consider only those events which belongs to 'perf_hw_context' in
collect_events().
