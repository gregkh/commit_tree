platform/x86: peaq-wmi: Add DMI check before binding to the WMI interface

It seems that the WMI GUID used by the PEAQ 2-in-1 WMI hotkeys is not
as unique as a GUID should be and is used on some other devices too.

This is causing spurious key-press reports on these other devices.

This commits adds a DMI check to the PEAQ 2-in-1 WMI hotkeys driver to
ensure that it is actually running on a PEAQ 2-in-1, fixing the
spurious key-presses on these other devices.
