KVM: arm/arm64: Use kvm_arm_timer_set/get_reg for guest register traps

When trapping on a guest access to one of the timer registers, we were
messing with the internals of the timer state from the sysregs handling
code, and that logic was about to receive more added complexity when
optimizing the timer handling code.

Therefore, since we already have timer register access functions (to
access registers from userspace), reuse those for the timer register
traps from a VM and let the timer code maintain its own consistency.
