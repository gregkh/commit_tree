Rename superblock flags (MS_xyz -> SB_xyz)

This is a pure automated search-and-replace of the internal kernel
superblock flags.

The s_flags are now called SB_*, with the names and the values for the
moment mirroring the MS_* flags that they're equivalent to.

Note how the MS_xyz flags are the ones passed to the mount system call,
while the SB_xyz flags are what we then use in sb->s_flags.

The script to do this was:

    # places to look in; re security/*: it generally should *not* be
    # touched (that stuff parses mount(2) arguments directly), but
    # there are two places where we really deal with superblock flags.
    FILES="drivers/mtd drivers/staging/lustre fs ipc mm \
            include/linux/fs.h include/uapi/linux/bfs_fs.h \
            security/apparmor/apparmorfs.c security/apparmor/include/lib.h"
    # the list of MS_... constants
    SYMS="RDONLY NOSUID NODEV NOEXEC SYNCHRONOUS REMOUNT MANDLOCK \
          DIRSYNC NOATIME NODIRATIME BIND MOVE REC VERBOSE SILENT \
          POSIXACL UNBINDABLE PRIVATE SLAVE SHARED RELATIME KERNMOUNT \
          I_VERSION STRICTATIME LAZYTIME SUBMOUNT NOREMOTELOCK NOSEC BORN \
          ACTIVE NOUSER"

    SED_PROG=
    for i in $SYMS; do SED_PROG="$SED_PROG -e s/MS_$i/SB_$i/g"; done

    # we want files that contain at least one of MS_...,
    # with fs/namespace.c and fs/pnode.c excluded.
    L=$(for i in $SYMS; do git grep -w -l MS_$i $FILES; done| sort|uniq|grep -v '^fs/namespace.c'|grep -v '^fs/pnode.c')

    for f in $L; do sed -i $f $SED_PROG; done
