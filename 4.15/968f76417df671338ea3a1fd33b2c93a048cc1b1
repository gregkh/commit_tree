ARM: bcm2836: Send event when onlining other cores

Secondary cores should enter a low-power idle state when waiting to
be started. The "wfe" instruction causes a core to wait until an event
or interrupt arrives before continuing to the next instruction, and
the "sev" instruction sends a wakeup event to the other cores.

Add an "sev" (and a memory barrier) to bcm2836_boot_secondary, the
function that wakes the waiting cores during booting. This is required
if the secondary cores are sitting in "wfe", and harmless if not.
