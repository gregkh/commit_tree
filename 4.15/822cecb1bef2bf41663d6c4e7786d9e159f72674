arm64: renesas: ulcb: fixup audio_clkout

"audio_clkout" is dummy clock of <&rcar_sound 0> to avoid clock loop
which invites probe conflict. Thus <&rcar_sound 0> and "audio_clkout"
should be same value.

On commit 2752660a37ae ("arm64: dts: renesas: ulcb: sound
clock-frequency needs descending order") exchanged <&rcar_sound 0>,
but it didn't modify "audio_clkout".
This patch fixup it.
