zram: set BDI_CAP_STABLE_WRITES once

With fast swap storage, the platform wants to use swap more aggressively
and swap-in is crucial to application latency.

The rw_page() based synchronous devices like zram, pmem and btt are such
fast storage.  When I profile swapin performance with zram lz4
decompress test, S/W overhead is more than 70%.  Maybe, it would be
bigger in nvdimm.

This patchset reduces swap-in latency by skipping swapcache if the swap
device is a synchronous device like a rw_page() based device.

It enhances by 45% my swapin test (5G sequential swapin, no readahead)
from 2.41sec to 1.64sec.

This patch (of 4):

Commit 19b7ccf8651d ("block: get rid of blk_integrity_revalidate()")
fixed a weird thing (i.e., reset BDI_CAP_STABLE_WRITES flag
unconditionally whenever revalidat_disk is called) so zram doesn't need
to reset the flag any more when revalidating the bdev.  Instead, set the
flag just once when the zram device is created.

It shouldn't change any behavior.
