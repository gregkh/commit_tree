s390/dasd: fix wrongly assigned configuration data

We store per path and per device configuration data to identify the
path or device correctly. The per path configuration data might get
mixed up if the original request gets into error recovery and is
started with a random path mask.

This would lead to a wrong identification of a path in case of a CUIR
event for example.

Fix by copying the path mask from the original request to the error
recovery request in case it is a path verification request.
