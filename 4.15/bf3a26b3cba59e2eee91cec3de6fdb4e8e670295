drm/i915/gvt: remove skl_misc_ctl_write handler

With different settings of compressed data hash mode between VMs and host
may cause gpu issues.

Commit: 1999f108c ("drm/i915/gvt: Disable compression workaround for Gen9")
disable compression workaround of guest in gvt host to align with host.

Commit: 93564044f ("drm/i915: Switch over to the LLC/eLLC hotspot avoidance
hash mode for CCS") add compression workaround, then we can remove the
skl_misc_ctl_write hanlder.

Better solution should be always keeping same settings as host, and bypass
the write request from VMs, but it need to fetch data from host's
"Context".
