drm/amd/display: Fix two MST not light up regressions

1. Change 100104: Move verify link cap after read edid causes MST
   link_cap struct not being set. It leads to zero denominator
   pbn_per_slot value, leading to the crash at
   dal_fixed31_32_div(). Skip MST link training for now and will
   need to add MST specific link traning routine later.

2. Change 98822: Adding edp supports changes link setting
   condition from max_link to verified_link. It leads to MST is
   getting wrong link settings.
   e.g. LINK_SPREAD_05_DOWNSPREAD_30KHZ not set in MST case
