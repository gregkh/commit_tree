KVM: arm64: Fix GICv4 init when called from vgic_its_create

Commit 3d1ad640f8c94 ("KVM: arm/arm64: Fix GICv4 ITS initialization
issues") moved the vgic_supports_direct_msis() check in vgic_v4_init().
However when vgic_v4_init is called from vgic_its_create(), the has_its
field is not yet set. Hence vgic_supports_direct_msis returns false and
vgic_v4_init does nothing.

The gic/its init sequence is a bit messy, so let's be specific about the
prerequisite checks in the various call paths instead of relying on a
common wrapper.
