net: thunderx: Fix TCP/UDP checksum offload for IPv6 pkts

Don't offload IP header checksum to NIC.

This fixes a previous patch which enabled checksum offloading
for both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  So L3 checksum offload was
getting enabled for IPv6 pkts.  And HW is dropping these pkts
as it assumes the pkt is IPv4 when IP csum offload is set
in the SQ descriptor.
