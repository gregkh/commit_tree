arm64: Implement arch-specific pte_access_permitted()

The generic pte_access_permitted() implementation only checks for
pte_present() (together with the write permission where applicable).
However, for both kernel ptes and PROT_NONE mappings pte_present() also
returns true on arm64 even though such mappings are not user accessible.
Additionally, arm64 now supports execute-only user permission
(PROT_EXEC) which is implemented by clearing the PTE_USER bit.

With this patch the arm64 implementation of pte_access_permitted()
checks for the PTE_VALID and PTE_USER bits together with writable access
if applicable.
