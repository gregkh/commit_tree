drm/i915/cnl: Fix PLL initialization for HDMI.

HDMI Mode selection on CNL is on CFGCR0 for that PLL, not
on in a global CTRL1 as it was on SKL.

The original patch addressed this difference, but leaving behind
this single entry here. So we were checking the wrong bits during
the PLL initialization and consequently avoiding the CFGCR1 setup
during HDMI initialization. Luckly when only HDMI was in use BIOS
had already setup this for us. But the dual display with hot plug
were messed up.
